874003,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0006TL806,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 4]","I must admit, I was very surprised by this film.  When you see the previews for P.S. it looks as if it is nothing more than a simple romantic comedy of sorts that hints more towards originality than refurbished Hollywood.  While there are elements of humor and greatness in this film, the preview can be a bit dissecting.  This is a tragedy of sorts.  It is the story of a woman still searching for her true self and cannot do that because of tragedy that has constantly fallen upon her during her life.  It reminds me of It's A Wonderful Life when George Bailey finally realizes that perhaps he isn't needed anymore in town and decides to end his life.  This is where our story somewhat begins with Louise (Laura Linney).  While it isn't as dramatic as Jimmy Stewart on a bridge, Linney does give off this aura of depression and pensiveness.  Where is her life, why does she continue with this repetitive routine at work, and what is her relationship with others around her are simple questions that become much larger as the film progresses.What really captured me with this film was the utterly beautiful chemistry between Topher Grace and Laura Linney.  They really embraced this sense of adventure, comfortability, and fear of the unknown exceptionally well.  From the moment that they shared screen time together until the rather poignant ending, I thought that the two of them made an award-winning pair.  Topher is growing up quickly in Hollywood and this film should prove that he has the ""chops"" to play with the bigger boys.  The same can be said for Linney that continues to prove that she can make movies that redefine the roles of both women in film and involved in film.  While I think that her role in this film should have garnered her with an Oscar nomination over the over-hyped lackluster Kinsey.  I am still honored to see her getting the praise that she deserves.  Her emotions are so raw and real that you can literally get lost in her words and actions while forgetting that you are actually watching a film.  I would be hard pressed to be able to name another actress that could do that with the material that she does.The rest of the cast in this film supported our two characters with the greatest of ease.  This film is the perfect example of small parts making a huge impact on a film.  Gabriel Byrne is outstanding in a role that could have been very one-dimensional.  He brings depth and almost a bit of ""evil"" to his character that he only helps give Linney that extra push into her climactic ending.  The same can be said for Paul Rudd and Marcia Gay Harden whom may seem miscast or at least oddly cast in this film, but both prove with the greatest of ease why they continue to work in Hollywood.  It was the strength of the cast that really brought this character study out of the ultimate fate of several others of the same nature.  The characters/actors brought this story to life and gave it this unglazed vision of the real world where people struggle with past histories and long for the opportunity to see what life would be like if only one thing would have been different.This leads me into my favorite part of the story which was the subtle themes and story that was happening behind the characters/actors.  There was more than just one element happening to our characters which helped give so much depth to the story and people.  It wasn't just Louise looking for love, but also the chance of a ""what if"" encounter that normally would never happen in your average person's life.  I loved all the elements from Byrne's secret, to Harden's indiscretions, to Rudd's dual life that really built a strong point for this story.  I felt as if these characters were real and that the elements that were facing them were not built by Hollywood, but instead crafted by the truth of another.  That is what made this story work.  There wasn't this all-powerful run to the airport at the end, but instead a somber moment that made you reflect back on the rest of the film, dreaming of another chance to watch.Overall, I really liked this movie.  I felt that director Dylan Kidd did a very wonderful and bold job with this film proving that he can handle everything from simple themes to multi-layered moments that will reign supreme in your mind.  Linney and Grace's chemistry was outstanding.  I watched this film with the words, ""I didn't think it would go this far..."" dripping from my mouth.  It was different than the previews and overall better.  I suggest it to all and hope that you will be able to see the vivid reality that Kidd has painted with his film, P.S.Grade: ***** out of *****",5,The Truth about Topher...,1108857600,"02 20, 2005",2005,4627,"['must', 'admit', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'film', 'When', 'see', 'previews', 'P.S', 'nothing', 'more', 'simple', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'sorts', 'more', 'towards', 'originality', 'refurbished', 'Hollywood', 'are', 'elements', 'humor', 'greatness', 'film', 'preview', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'dissecting', 'tragedy', 'sorts', 'story', 'woman', 'still', 'searching', 'true', 'self', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'tragedy', 'constantly', 'fallen', 'life', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'when', 'George', 'Bailey', 'finally', 'perhaps', ""n't"", 'needed', 'anymore', 'town', 'end', 'life', 'where', 'story', 'somewhat', 'Louise', 'Laura', 'Linney', ""n't"", 'as', 'dramatic', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'bridge', 'Linney', 'give', 'off', 'aura', 'depression', 'pensiveness', 'Where', 'life', 'why', 'continue', 'repetitive', 'routine', 'work', 'what', 'relationship', 'others', 'are', 'simple', 'questions', 'become', 'much', 'larger', 'film', 'really', 'captured', 'film', 'was', 'utterly', 'beautiful', 'chemistry', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'really', 'embraced', 'sense', 'adventure', 'comfortability', 'fear', 'unknown', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'moment', 'shared', 'screen', 'time', 'together', 'rather', 'poignant', 'ending', 'thought', 'two', 'made', 'award-winning', 'pair', 'growing', 'up', 'quickly', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'should', 'prove', 'chops', 'play', 'bigger', 'boys', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Linney', 'prove', 'can', 'make', 'movies', 'redefine', 'roles', 'women', 'film', 'involved', 'film', 'think', 'role', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'garnered', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'over-hyped', 'lackluster', 'Kinsey', 'am', 'still', 'honored', 'see', 'getting', 'praise', 'emotions', 'are', 'so', 'raw', 'real', 'can', 'literally', 'get', 'lost', 'words', 'actions', 'forgetting', 'are', 'actually', 'watching', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'be', 'able', 'name', 'actress', 'could', 'do', 'material', 'does.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'film', 'supported', 'two', 'characters', 'greatest', 'ease', 'film', 'perfect', 'example', 'small', 'parts', 'making', 'huge', 'impact', 'film', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'outstanding', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'one-dimensional', 'depth', 'almost', 'bit', 'evil', 'character', 'only', 'give', 'Linney', 'extra', 'push', 'climactic', 'ending', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'whom', 'may', 'seem', 'miscast', 'least', 'oddly', 'cast', 'film', 'prove', 'greatest', 'ease', 'why', 'continue', 'work', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'strength', 'cast', 'really', 'brought', 'character', 'study', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'several', 'others', 'same', 'nature', 'characters/actors', 'brought', 'story', 'life', 'gave', 'unglazed', 'vision', 'real', 'world', 'where', 'people', 'struggle', 'past', 'histories', 'long', 'opportunity', 'see', 'what', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'different.This', 'favorite', 'part', 'story', 'was', 'subtle', 'themes', 'story', 'was', 'happening', 'characters/actors', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'one', 'element', 'happening', 'characters', 'helped', 'give', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'story', 'people', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'Louise', 'looking', 'love', 'also', 'chance', 'what', 'encounter', 'normally', 'would', 'never', 'happen', 'average', 'person', 'life', 'loved', 'elements', 'Byrne', 'secret', 'Harden', 'indiscretions', 'Rudd', 'dual', 'life', 'really', 'built', 'strong', 'point', 'story', 'felt', 'characters', 'were', 'real', 'elements', 'were', 'facing', 'were', 'not', 'built', 'Hollywood', 'instead', 'crafted', 'truth', 'what', 'made', 'story', 'work', 'was', ""n't"", 'all-powerful', 'run', 'airport', 'end', 'instead', 'somber', 'moment', 'made', 'reflect', 'back', 'rest', 'film', 'dreaming', 'chance', 'watch.Overall', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'felt', 'director', 'Dylan', 'Kidd', 'did', 'very', 'wonderful', 'bold', 'job', 'film', 'proving', 'can', 'handle', 'everything', 'simple', 'themes', 'multi-layered', 'moments', 'will', 'reign', 'supreme', 'mind', 'Linney', 'Grace', 'chemistry', 'was', 'outstanding', 'watched', 'film', 'words', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'go', 'far', 'dripping', 'mouth', 'was', 'different', 'previews', 'overall', 'better', 'suggest', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'vivid', 'reality', 'Kidd', 'painted', 'film', 'P.S.Grade', '*****', '*****']",P.S.

I was impressed, primarily, by the cast list, having seen all but Topher Grace in action many times, and I know how talented and capable the entire ensemble is. But the huge talents of professionals like Lois Smith and Marcia Gay Harden are pretty much wasted here. What I got was your basic chick-flick, which, in itself, is fine, but so many of the scenes comprised little more than Linney and Grace making soulful goo-goo eyes at each other with a gratuitous steamy sex scene. The premise of the story is pretty well-used. (Remember ""Chances Are,"" with Cybill Shepherd and Robert Downey?) This is a pithier version on the same theme and the only thing that saves the wreckage is the solid performances turned in by the woefully misused cast.

874008,ASKUZHOKQ1W3E,B0006TL806,"Dane R. Youssef ""surfur""","[6, 6]","by Dane Youssef""P.S."" is one of those rare movies that tells a story which feels too good to be true--the kind that's escapist-fantasy and only seems to happen in movies and in our most desperate dreams.But then again, sometimes we see and here that it does happen in real life. Once in a blue moon. It's every great success story. Like movie-star Lana Turner getting discovered when working in a pharmacy or Muhammad Ali's almost inhumanly-impossible success with his career in the ring, who talked like a professional wrestler.""P.S."" is a movie like that. It tells a story as sweet as a fairy tale, that maybe could happen in life. Where a woman feels like when she loses someone, she loses her chance in life. But then something else comes along that is so incredible, it feels like the divine hand. Is God giving her a do-over? And not being so subtle about it?Laura Linney continues her streak of must-see movies and Oscar-caliber performances here as Louise, a middle-aged admissions director who's been through a real losing streak throughout her life.She's recently divorced from her husband, a compulsive sex-addict who's diddled anyone who's set toe in his class. Her best friend seduced away her boyfriend in high school and is now married in an upper-middle class suburb to a man she threatens to cheat on if he doesn't fulfill his ""husbandly duties."" She's living the kind of life every woman wants to in her most cynical, vengeful, self-absorbed fantasies.Laura's getting older, life's getting harder (and it hasn't been very charmed to begin with). She begins to see all her hopes and dreams fading fast. And things get even more interesting when see has a private one-on-one interview with a potential art student.This guy is just her type. Not only, but... he bares an uncanny resemblance to her late college boyfriend, an art major with a passion that matched hers. This guy doesn't just look--he sounds, acts, behaves and his art is even similar. Louise is in shock.What is this? Coincidence? Incidental? Has she been working herself too hard? Stress? Reincarnation? An escapist-fantasy movie-plot? Whatever it is, Louise is rubbing here eyes while warming up to this guy. Getting to know him... finds herself feeling something.... While trying to keep her feelings at bay. She's a skeptic. She's got one heck a heck of a track record.One of the most refreshing things about the actress Laura Linney is that she's not just another manufactured beauty from off the assembly line. She's not just another actress. She's not ""one of a million."" She's just so real. She's not movie-star-ish.She doesn't wear designer clothes wherever she goes, live in a six-story mansion of Muhulland Dr, smoke cigarettes from a long black holder and have a private trophy room for all her honors. When she acts, it doesn't feel like acting. You feel you know her. She's a real person.The same hold true for Topher Grace, which explains his success as an actor. He seems so adult, so grown-up for his age. Grace is charismatic and seems smart, his gift and his power on-screen doesn't come from a natural Brando-like acting talent, but his face, his body, his voice, his personality. Somehow, everything he says sounds like he means it. He's so square, so on-the-level. All he has to do is speak to convince you that he's legit.As an actor, Grace has a style all his own which may or may not be intentional. He has an Anti-Brando method. He never changes his appearance or voice at all in his roles, but he has an earnest, open-faced, true-to-life and genuinely human way in every movie he so much as touches. Which explains why Hollywood keeps throwing mountains of scripts his way and why every movie he's in, he's given a nomination for something.This is some of the best acting either Linney or Grace has ever done so far, pure and simple.Gabriel Bryne, one of the finest actors in the world brings his trade-mark debonair and charisma in the role of Peter Harrington, Louise's ex-husband who's nasty habit primarily caused their divorce. There scenes that poke fun and make light of his ""f-----g"" habit are almost worth the rental price.Which is why he takes home award after award for nearly every movie he does, because something about his whole appearance and personality makes it come across like he's just himself being himself, not an actor.While ""P.S."" may just come across as a woman's picture (and it may well be), this isn't just a moody, sensitive, overly-emotional ""chick-flick"" to be seen on a ""woman's day."" This is a movie about some people who are seriously dealing with the trials of life at a turning point of age.Paul Rudd, who been the key performance in some damn good movies, has basically just a little cameo, but as the estranged brother, he gives us further magnified scope into Louise's little life. He's a reformed junkie with a condescending, sadistic streak towards his big sis.The movie has a deep, human, true-to-life atmosphere all throughout. There's nary a moment that is written or executed in a way that feels contrived. Nothing in ""P.S."" needs willing suspension of disbelief. Everything feels so beautiful and natural as the falling of the rain.I've read an endless number of reviews for this movie which charge Dylan Kidd with making a picture less impressive than his previous effort. Ah, the sophomore jinx. I didn't see his freshman effort, ""Roger Dodger,"" so I'm not particularly biased. And anyway, shouldn't a film be judged solely on it's own merits? Even Steven Spielberg made ""Always,"" ""Hook"" and ""1941.""Listen folks, seriously, so many filmmakers are accused being cursed with the dreaded ""sophomore jinx"" because when it comes to art, there are people who rate novelty above all else.Movies like ""Birth and ""Return To Me"" have tackled this subject before, but here it feels so legitimate. Like ""Rocky,"" this one makes us believe clich&eacute;s can happen... and make us care.by Dane Youssef",4,One of the best of 2004.

He advises her to ""find the pattern"" and that will be the success to her getting on in life.Again, even Rudd's character is just a little too wise beyond years for this film.Even actress Lois Smith, as Sammy and Louise's mother, is full of ""sagacity"" that just seems a little too pat.All in all, the performances are excellent and Marcia Gay Harden as Linney's best friend ,Missy, is superb; but with all of the actors,I did not find that there was any new revelation about any of their talents.They were good as they usually are, in a film that tries to be just a little too smart for it's own good.",4,Almost a little too smart for it's own good!,1205020800,"03 9, 2008",2008,1782,"['P.S', 'smart', 'screenplay', 'almost', 'too', 'smart', 'own', 'good.What', 'superficially', 'May-December', 'romance', '39', 'year', 'old', 'Columbia', 'Grad', 'teacher', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'young', 'Columbia', 'artist/applicant', 'named', 'Scott', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'really', 'more', 'fear', 'looking', 'backward', 'trying', 'recapture', 'past', 'Linney', 'Louise', 'fear', 'insecurity', 'growing', 'up', 'moving', 'forward', 'Grace', 'Scott', '.Each', 'character', 'epiphanies', 'who', 'are', 'who', 'were', 'who', 'are', 'hoping', 'be.The', 'dialogue', 'HEAVY-HANDED', 'almost', 'too', 'preachy', 'too', 'wordy', 'wise', 'own', 'good', 'characters', 'seem', 'get', 'things', 'just', 'little', 'quicker', 'normal', 'person', 'would.I', 'think', 'figured', 'out', 'title', 'P.S', 'pre', 'Scott', 'post', 'Scott.You', 'see', 'Linney', 'Scott', 'may', 'be', 'reincarnate', 'High', 'School', 'sweetheart', 'who', 'had', 'same', 'name', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'car', 'accident.Obviously', 'never', 'gotten', 'ended', 'up', 'broken', 'marriage', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'who', 'whole', 'ball', 'problems', 'own', 'discover.The', 'sound', 'advice', 'film', 'Sammy', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'who', 'Linney', 'recovery', 'drug', 'addict', 'brother', 'find', 'pattern', 'will', 'be', 'success', 'getting', 'life.Again', 'even', 'Rudd', 'character', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'wise', 'years', 'film.Even', 'actress', 'Lois', 'Smith', 'Sammy', 'Louise', 'mother', 'full', 'sagacity', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'pat.All', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Linney', 'best', 'friend', 'Missy', 'superb', 'actors', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'was', 'new', 'revelation', 'talents.They', 'were', 'good', 'usually', 'are', 'film', 'be', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'smart', 'own', 'good']",P.S.

If another go round like THE OTHER or the Shyamalan films is what you're expecting, then look elsewhere.  This is more a story about falling in love and the past needs and memories such an event can surface.Louise (Laura Linney in yet another sensitive, multifaceted, mesmerizing performance) is a 39 year old admissions worker for Columbia University, a divorced woman whose best friends are still her ex-husband Peter (Gabriel Byrne) and her old high school chum Missy (Marcia Gay Harden), and whose job it is to mail catalogues and respond to admission inquiries for the art department.  It is in this last capacity that she encounters an application from a young man F. Scott Feinstadt (Topher Grace) whose name coincidentally happens to be the same as her first and unforgettable love in high school, a boy whose affections were stolen from her by Missy just prior to his accidental death.Overstepping her menial bounds, Louise telephones F. Scott, makes an appointment with him for an 'interview', and on meeting him finds he not only bears the same name as her lost love, but also physically resembles him and paints like him. Louise throws caution to the wind and leaps at the chance to revive what seems to be a lost love affair.  The much younger F. Scott reciprocates and the two begin what appears to be an impossible romance.Louise is warned against her impetuous affair by Peter (who confesses an 'addiction' to her that throws Louise into insecure terror) and she turns to Missy (living in California but in need of breaking out of her claustrophobic marriage, a fact she relates to Louise in daily telephone conversations).  Missy appears in New York, finds F. Scott, and once again is an intrusive obstruction to Louise's increasingly dependent love role with F.Scott.  This triggers a big reality check on the whole chain of events and how that is resolved forms the ending of the film.Added to the DVD are five 'deleted scenes' each of which is superb in writing and in acting and the movie would have been even better had the scenes been included.  The actors are all terrific and the relationship examination between Louise and 'F. Scott' point out many fine questions about what constitutes love, is love between an older woman and a younger man viable, can we trust anyone when our eyes are clouded with need and desire, etc.  It is a shame Laura Linney wasn't nominated for her work in this film as she is extraordinarily fine.

In PS, 39 year-old Laura Linney practically throws young Topher Grace on her couch. She is absolutely licking her chops since Grace looks, indeed has the same name, as her teen love. A past love had been killed in a car accident. Linney's best friend, Marcia Gay, was interested also. Anyhow, Grace's twenty year-old personality and looks resembles the dead lover, so Linney thinks he's a gift from heaven. Her life with an ex-husband had been less than satisfying. Yes, she's got a descent job at Columbia, but she's not happy; hence, Topher Grace not only gets lucky, he gets involved in a weird and wonderful love situation.The film is nice to watch, as a remarkable group of actors make a tricky premise psychologically plausible. The actors (Linney, Grace, and Harden in particular) never make a false step in bringing their characters to life, and the implausible premise seems somehow unimportant as they draw the viewer into a believable existential drama. The abrupt and ambiguous ending disappoints and destroys the possibility of regarding the film as a satisfying work of art, but as a complex depiction of a life in which dreams have been destroyed (and perhaps are salvaged), and as a field-day for several great actors.

But Roger Dodger feels tight, finished, and driven by a wild logic of its own, while P.S. is riddled with incompletenesses.  Laura Linney is such a fine and affecting actress that she could convince me she had erotic chemistry with a bookcase, but  despite her talents, the alleged electricity between her character and her young paramour in P.S., played by Topher Grace,  required frequent suspensions of my disbelief.  Grace here has such a hard time leaving his arch, ""That 70s Show"" schtick behind that he plays this film as though it were a bizarre dream sequence from his TV program.  He often looks impatient and half-in-character, as if he expects Laura Propane, his redheaded gal pal from the TV show, to rustle him awake so he can say, ""That was the weirdest dream"" and proceed in the comfortable universe of avocado and harvest gold situation comedy.  Also, the script for this film is half-baked.

874016,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B0006TL806,Jonathan Appleseed,"[22, 23]","This was a wonderful, subtle film about love, in its many different forms. Love in a failed marriage, high school crushes, the idea of a fantasy lover reincarnated, and the expectations of love placed upon the fantasy lover.Topher Grace was outstanding. There wasn't the barest hint of his character from That 70s show, which is refreshing, because in almost every Ashton Kutcher film there are plenty of hints. I always thought that Grace would be the better actor of the two, and I think we're starting to see that.Laura Linney turned in a wonderful performance as always. She's as reliable as a brownstone. I've never once seen an imperfection in any of her performances. Any scene in which she evokes emotions are perfectly done.One can't help but wonder how one would react in Louise's (Linney) situation, and the film did a very good job of sharing her reaction with us, so that we shared it with her. Her immediate attraction to Fran (Grace), and her immediate and passionate desire for sexual relations was compulsive. I found myself feeling sorry for, knowing that she wasn't having sex with him; rather, she was having sex with the F. Scott she loved from high school. It seems that she eventually came to love Fran for who he was, although the age difference was significant and didn't seem to be addressed at all. I would have liked to understand Fran's attraction to older women a little better. I certainly understand that very often younger men or women are attracted to older women or men (or the reverse), but usually each situation is unique, so to see what Fran's unique attraction was would have been interesting and very telling about who he is.To be honest, I wasn't expecting to like this film. The concept of reincarnated love is a territory that's been explored extensively (recently uncomfortably so in Birth, starring Nicole Kidman). I only rented the film to see if my estimations regarding Topher Grace were correct. Not only did I find out that they were, but I also enjoyed the film immensely. It was touching, intelligent, thought provoking, and layered.

874017,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B0006TL806,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[3, 3]","Louise (Laura Linney) is a college admissions employee who wonders if a prospective student is the reincarnation of her high school boyfriend (who was killed in a tragic accident) or if she is simply deluded by a guy who looks eerily like her old flame. Intriguing premise, but one that has admittedly been covered before.What makes THIS film different is that it manages to explore its theme without giving any clearcut answers and by showing that sometimes exploring the past and coming to terms with it is more important than the actual truth. In the end, it doesn't really matter if the new guy is her ex-boyfriend in a new body. Simply by appearing in Louise's life, he forces her to grow and change. Odds are, you'll want to stick around for the ride.The viewer is forced to wonder, along with Louise, what is happening and IF the incredibly charismatic F. Scott (Topher Grace)COULD be her old love. He is so sexy, so funny and earnest that you'll WANT him to be...but is he?The film pulls no punches in showing that love, whether old or new, comes with complications. The high school boyfriend wasn't perfect, far from it. Not only that, Louise's ex-husband, who is  still one of her best friends, has a whole nest of secrets that she is only now beginning to discover> Divorced or not, she finds herself stunned by the revelations of her ex-husband.As the above should indicate, this isn't a ""romantic"" film in the sense that it looks at love and attraction as some sweet, ethereal thing with no ugly sides. Love at first sight and all that - no, this isn't THAT movie. Instead, happiness and anger, love and hate...they all pop up at odd moments....just like in real life.When F. Scott walks into Louise's life, applying as a prospective student to the university, his appearance, personality and even his initials mirror those of her old boyfriend. They even have the same birthday. Louise is hard pressed not to see this as a possibly fated meeting. A love affair is inevitable, one between an older woman and a much younger man. The sex scenes are steamy, if occasionally awkward. Topher Grace covers the ""boyish but handsome"" role well.As I watched this, I knew I HAD to see what was going to happen. WOULD F. Scott turn out to be the ex? Would Louise get a second chance at reconciling past difficulties in that relationship? Questions like those are at the heart of this filma as F. Scott forces Louise to confront her past and to push past her delusions, denials and romantic assumptions of what was - and what could be, right here, right now.Unfortunately, the movie has flat moments and parts of it drag. There is so much angst that it beguns to wear thin and it is difficult to see how F. Scott could hang with Louise through her bitchier, even cruel,moments... except for the fact that Louise could be a deciding factor in his admission to the university.That, of course, brings up all sorts of power issues and one can't help wondering if he initially goes along with the affair partially because of self-interest, although that is never clearly stated but the power issue can't be denied. Any time one person plays a seminal role in deciding another person's future, there is an imbalance of power, whether it is overtly discussed or not.And yet... I couldn't stop watching this, especially since Laura Linney, as usual, never acts ""on automatic"" and always reveals the depth of the characters she plays, never taking the easy way out, not afraid to be unlikeable at times. This could not have been an easy role to take on as Louise isn't always appealing, being ambivalent and even downright mean at times. She is also vulnerable, heartbroken, passionate and warm, depending on the moment. It is a stunning performance and one I'm betting many women will relate to, far more than the stereotyped ""beautiful woman"" roles that many actresses are forced into.

She receives an application from Grace, who has the same name and appearance as an artist-boyfriend from her youth, a boyfriend she shared with best friend Hayden. Linney's ex-husband and still friend, Byrne, adds fuel to this volatile mixture when he admits he was a sex addict during their marriage and made love to hundreds of women ""and men, too.""After Linney begins an affair with Grace -- her seeming boyfriend raised from the dead -- she has a great line after her admission of her ex's failures during their marriage. ""He cheated on you?"" Grace asks; ""He probably bleeped you at some point,"" Linney responds...only she didn't say bleeped.This movie is slow getting under way but interesting and fun in the final hour. Its pathos is genuine and reminiscent of the effect Linney created in her made-for-cable film ""Wild Iris"" which I think is her best work. I very much like that an actress of Linney's stature (an Academy award winner for her role in ""Kinsey"") will take on roles that are more deomcratic to audiences, who can in turn connect with her character and respond to even the most foolish elements of the storyboard.Buy, rent or borrow this flick if you enjoy romance, soap opera, or otherwise like effective socialization in cinema.

874020,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0006TL806,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 5]","When I was attending Johnson Middle School on an American Air Force Base in Japan (in the same buildings where they trained Kamikaze pilots during World War II), I had a crush on this one girl named Michelle who pretty much ignored me (except for once when she wanted to make this other guy jealous, not that I could have been used for such purposes at that age).  My father retired to New Mexico and I went to high school.  One night during my first year somebody called the house and said it was a phone call for me from Japan.  I immediately jumped to the conclusion that it was Michelle calling me, which made absolutely no sense whatsoever if I was thinking with my brain but obviously sprung from a more emotional place.  My hopes were immediately dashed and it would be another two years before a girl would finally ask me out on a date.I mention this story because it allows me to understand the leap of illogic that overwhelms Louise Harrington (Laura Linney) in ""p.s.,"" an Independent film written and directed by Dylan Kidd (""One Wild Night"") based on the novel by Helen Schulman.  The tagline for the film is ""What would you do for a second chance?""  Louise is an admissions officer at Columbia and when she sees an application from F. Scott Feinstadt (Topher Grace), she calls him up to come in for an interview.  After it is over she runs after him and ends up taking him back to her apartment where she pretty much literally jumps him.  It does not matter that she is an admissions officer and he is a candidate for admissions.  Nor does it matter that she is 39 and he is 18.  All that matters is that his name is Scott Feinstadt and he looks something like the young boy drawn on a napkin that Louise has in her possession.Eventually we (and F. Scott) learn that Louise considers him to be a dead ringer for her boyfriend who died when she was 17.  She insists that F. Scott looks like this boy, sounds like this boy, paints like this boy, and basically makes it clear that the evidence is so obvious and overwhelming that the only reasonable thing to do is treat him like her Scott brought back to life.  This Scott likes the sexual part and while being considered a dead guy is bad enough, it is the fact that Louise thinks his art is not his own that really upsets him.  If Louisa was not in a vulnerable enough position to begin with, her ex-husband Peter (Gabriel Byrne) has reached Step 9 in his recovery program and shows up to make amends (This is never a good thing in the movies.  Well, okay, not never, but the odds are really against you on this thing).If this remind you of ""Birth,"" another 2004 film, let me assure you that you are not alone.  This time the young boy is older, so that there is a sexual dimension to the relationship, but that is not as important as the emotional turmoil that Louise is going through.  The biggest difference between ""p.s."" and ""Birth""--and why I rounded up on this one--is that this time when Louise turns to her friend, Missy Goldberg (Marcia Gay Harden) and says that this kid looks like the long dead Scott, her friend readily agrees instead of giving the more obvious rejoinder as to possible insanity.  At that point the two women proceed to fight over this Scott, the same way they did over the earlier one two decades earlier.  This has its comic moments, but there is also a tragic irony to it and this becomes the best scene in Kidd's film, not only because of the performance by Linney, but because it embracing the absurdity of the situation her character finds the means to let it go.",4,"""You can't tell someone they're dead.

874021,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0006TL806,Lee Armstrong,"[4, 4]","Despite a few plot holes, I enjoyed ""P.S."" as a story about romantic possibilities and for its excellent cast.  This is the 2nd directorial effort by Dylan Kidd after his 2002 ""Roger Dodger"" with Campbell Scott.  Perhaps the holes in the story come from the screenplay rather than direction.  For instance, it was never clear whether there was any relationship between the deceased Scott Feinstadt and Francis Scott Feinstadt played by Topher Grace.  If it's reincarnation, why did they have the same name?  Also, the issue of an admissions counselor having an affair with one of her 'counselees' didn't seem to bother anyone as possibly ethically challenged.  However, despite those irksome details, Laura Linney does a great job as Louise Harrington.  Linney has had 2 Oscar nominations (Best Actress for ""You Can Count On Me"" & Best Supporting Actress for ""Kinsey"") as well as strong appearances in ""Primal Fear"" with Richard Gere, ""Absolute Power"" with Clint Eastwood & as Sean Penn's wife in ""Mystic River.""  She gives an edgy performance as the woman haunted by a past love, conflicted about a broken marriage, and jazzed about a young painter.  Topher Grace was recognized by the National Board of Review for a ""Breakthrough Performance"" in 2004 for this film and for ""In Good Company.""  His attraction to Linney is as sudden as it is strong, although we wonder if he's just trying to get into the program.  However, the ending and his final flirtatious smile seem to illuminate F. Scott's sincerity.  Also, I really liked the paintings that they used in his slide portfolio.  Marcia Gay Harden has an Oscar for ""Pollock"" and a nomination for ""Mystic River.""  She & Linney team again here in ""P.S."" as best friends.  While Missy isn't a tremendously demanding role, Harden comes across with sparkle & flare.  Gabriel Byrne as the ex-husband with a sex addiction turns in a good performance.  Paul Rudd, who I first noticed with Jennifer Aniston in ""The Object of My Affection"" in 1998, from ""Friends"" on TV, and recently in ""Anchorman"" with Will Farrell, does a good job in the cameo as brother Sammy Silverstein.  Ever since ""Twister"" in 1996 where she played Aunt Meg, I always adore seeing Lois Smith.  She plays a much nicer character here as Linney's mother than her the scientist from ""Minority Report.""

It is, by just a tad, as I really liked the performances by Laura Linney and Topher Grace, but the film is loyal to the novel.  People who think that the director just threw subplots out there obviously haven't read the novel.  Louise's (Laura Linney) husband Peter (Gabriel Byrne) did have a sex addiction in the novel, and her brother did have a gambling addiction and received money from Peter for a financial scheme.  Why it's in the novel is probably to enhance the idea that all the characters have an addiction to something, and Louise is no different.  As I said, I liked both performances, yet I didn't really see any chemistry between the two of them...no sense of a real attraction.  They looked like they were using each other for selfish goals (he because, why not...no young 20-something male is going to refuse a sexual encounter with an attractive older lady; her to fulfill a long-held fantasy about her high school boyfriend).Now, about that premise...the film's trailer hinted at a reincarnation story and this film hangs its whole premise on the idea that a 20-year old student named F. Scott Feinstadt looks exactly like Scott Feinstadt, who died twenty years ago.  Not only do they share the same name and the same look, but both were budding artists whom Louise and her best friend Missy (played by Marcia Gay Harden) were in love with.  The film, just like the novel, never explains the coincidences or offer any clue as to what it could mean.  That might be the intention of the writer/director...but it cheapens the film and novel with laziness by remaining ambiguous.  Don't sell something as something else (""a reincarnation movie that doesn't explore reincarnation"").  I'm personally fascinated by reincarnation and believe in it, and because there are so few films that cover the topic in a serious way, there is a unique market out there that would be hungry for films that explored the topic in a serious way.  This film is not it.  Thus, my disappointment overall.After hearing the director's commentary with a second viewing of the film, I did get to learn more about the meaning of the film and it makes a little bit more sense.  The message of it is good (about how we put expectations on others who remind us of someone else, and when the person reveals himself to be someone other than our fantasy image, how that pushes them away from having a real relationship with the person), but its not the message I was sold on (which was a reincarnation story).  Because of the deceptive advertising, I'm glad this film bombed in theaters.  Since its obviously not about reincarnation, it could easily have been about cloning, which would have made a better film premise.The only thing this film has going for it are the performances by Laura Linney and Topher Grace; and its interesting to watch the uncomfortable love scene between the two of them that occurs early on in the film.  Both actors are good in their own right, but together, there's no sense of real chemistry.  Its nothing more than awkward from the get-go.  I gave the novel two stars, and this film gets three stars because of the actors...but is this film worth owning or watching more than twice?  No.  Hopefully a more serious film about reincarnation will be made some day.  This one (and ""Birth"") are not that story.  And if any Hollywood types are reading this...don't sell a film on false pretenses/premises.  If its not about reincarnation, then don't present it as such.  Truth in advertising applies to film as well as products.",3,Good cast selection in a mediocre movie,1109894400,"03 4, 2005",2005,3782,"['read', 'novel', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'film', 'hit', 'theaters', 'inticed', 'hints', 'reincarnation', 'was', 'disappointed', 'novel', 'not', 'being', 'what', 'claimed', 'be', 'somehow', 'expected', 'film', 'be', 'vast', 'improvement', 'novel', 'just', 'tad', 'really', 'liked', 'performances', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'film', 'loyal', 'novel', 'People', 'who', 'think', 'director', 'just', 'threw', 'subplots', 'out', 'there', 'obviously', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'novel', 'Louise', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'husband', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'did', 'have', 'sex', 'addiction', 'novel', 'brother', 'did', 'have', 'gambling', 'addiction', 'received', 'money', 'Peter', 'financial', 'scheme', 'Why', 'novel', 'probably', 'enhance', 'idea', 'characters', 'have', 'addiction', 'something', 'Louise', 'different', 'said', 'liked', 'performances', 'yet', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'chemistry', 'two', 'sense', 'real', 'attraction', 'looked', 'were', 'using', 'other', 'selfish', 'goals', 'because', 'why', 'not', 'young', '20-something', 'male', 'going', 'refuse', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'attractive', 'older', 'lady', 'fulfill', 'long-held', 'fantasy', 'high', 'school', 'boyfriend', '.Now', 'premise', 'film', 'trailer', 'hinted', 'reincarnation', 'story', 'film', 'whole', 'premise', 'idea', '20-year', 'old', 'student', 'named', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Feinstadt', 'exactly', 'like', 'Scott', 'Feinstadt', 'who', 'died', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'share', 'same', 'name', 'same', 'look', 'were', 'budding', 'artists', 'whom', 'Louise', 'best', 'friend', 'Missy', 'played', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'were', 'love', 'film', 'just', 'novel', 'never', 'coincidences', 'offer', 'clue', 'what', 'could', 'mean', 'might', 'be', 'intention', 'writer/director', 'film', 'novel', 'laziness', 'remaining', 'ambiguous', 'Do', ""n't"", 'sell', 'something', 'something', 'else', 'reincarnation', 'movie', ""n't"", 'explore', 'reincarnation', ""'m"", 'personally', 'fascinated', 'reincarnation', 'believe', 'are', 'so', 'few', 'films', 'cover', 'topic', 'serious', 'way', 'unique', 'market', 'there', 'would', 'be', 'hungry', 'films', 'explored', 'topic', 'serious', 'way', 'film', 'not', 'Thus', 'disappointment', 'overall.After', 'hearing', 'director', 'commentary', 'second', 'viewing', 'film', 'did', 'get', 'learn', 'more', 'meaning', 'film', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'sense', 'message', 'good', 'how', 'put', 'expectations', 'others', 'who', 'remind', 'someone', 'else', 'when', 'person', 'be', 'someone', 'other', 'fantasy', 'image', 'how', 'away', 'having', 'real', 'relationship', 'person', 'not', 'message', 'was', 'sold', 'was', 'reincarnation', 'story', 'deceptive', 'advertising', ""'m"", 'glad', 'film', 'bombed', 'theaters', 'obviously', 'not', 'reincarnation', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'cloning', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'film', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'going', 'are', 'performances', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'interesting', 'watch', 'uncomfortable', 'love', 'scene', 'two', 'early', 'film', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'own', 'right', 'together', 'sense', 'real', 'chemistry', 'nothing', 'more', 'awkward', 'get-go', 'gave', 'novel', 'two', 'stars', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'actors', 'film', 'worth', 'owning', 'watching', 'more', 'twice', 'No', 'Hopefully', 'more', 'serious', 'film', 'reincarnation', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'day', 'one', 'Birth', 'are', 'not', 'story', 'Hollywood', 'types', 'are', 'reading', 'do', ""n't"", 'sell', 'film', 'false', 'pretenses/premises', 'not', 'reincarnation', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'present', 'such', 'Truth', 'advertising', 'applies', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'products']",P.S.
874026,AIDQV95MLCIDD,B0006TL806,P. Luce,"[4, 5]","Although the movie has some flaws, the actors in P.S. keep you interested in the characters, and you stay hooked from the time it starts until the credits. The movie was directed by Dylan Kidd, who also wrote the screenplay, and is based on the novel by Helen Schulman. It stars Laura Linney, who also starred in You Can Count on Me, as Louise who holds a position in admissions to the Art program at Columbia University. Linney plays the character in a very subtle way which adds to drawing the viewer into her world. She appears to have a good life with a good job, but at the same time her life seems to be lacking something. She is middle-aged, divorced, and has no love life. Her world is turned upside down when she receives an admissions request from a hopeful artist played by Topher Grace, of Traffic and That 70's Show, who has the same name, appearance, and artistic talent of Linney's first love in high school. You quickly learn that the high school love died and Louise never really got over him. From there, the movie focuses on Linnery's pursuit of this new artist and their quick romance.Unfortunately this is where some of the movie's flaws begin to develop. Grace's character is never really fully explored nor is the character of the lost love he represents. The two quickly fall in love and there is no consideration for the consequences of that love. Also, Grace tends to come off as annoying instead of charming, and continues to act the same way in every role he takes. Other characters, such as the high school friend played by Marcia Gay Harden, Mystic River, and the ex-husband played by the great Gabriel Byrne become just side aspects of the plot. We learn Harden's character, now a married bored housewife, also had an a relationship with the dead high school artist, but not much more. Byrne admits to having an sexual addiction and cheating on Linney while they were married, but that isn't further explored. Paul Rudd plays Linney's brother, also a recovering addict, but he is more of a phone-in performance than a real character.The movie does make up for its flaws with the solid performance by Linney who continues to impress with each role she takes. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good romance or even a pretty good drama. It is slow and it does have some holes in the plot, but the performances more than make up for what it lacks.The movie is sort of bare bones when it comes to special features. They consist of the theatrical trailer for the film, previews for Head In the Clouds and House of the Flying Daggers. It also has five deleted scenes that do a better job of adding to the relationship between Linney and Grace. They have optional commentary from the director. A couple could have been left on the cutting room floor, such as a pool game in the bar where Linney meets some of Grace's friends, but there are two that do a good job of showing the relationship taking form and exploring Linney's life.Again, the movie isn't the greatest love story ever told, but it is definitely worth watching.",4,p.s. worth watching and enjoying,1107907200,"02 9, 2005",2005,3066,"['movie', 'flaws', 'actors', 'P.S', 'keep', 'interested', 'characters', 'stay', 'hooked', 'time', 'credits', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'Dylan', 'Kidd', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'based', 'novel', 'Helen', 'Schulman', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'who', 'also', 'starred', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'Louise', 'who', 'position', 'admissions', 'Art', 'program', 'Columbia', 'University', 'Linney', 'character', 'very', 'subtle', 'way', 'drawing', 'viewer', 'world', 'have', 'good', 'life', 'good', 'job', 'same', 'time', 'life', 'be', 'lacking', 'something', 'middle-aged', 'divorced', 'love', 'life', 'world', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'admissions', 'request', 'hopeful', 'artist', 'played', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'Traffic', '70', 'Show', 'who', 'same', 'name', 'appearance', 'artistic', 'talent', 'Linney', 'first', 'love', 'high', 'school', 'quickly', 'learn', 'high', 'school', 'love', 'died', 'Louise', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'there', 'movie', 'Linnery', 'pursuit', 'new', 'artist', 'quick', 'romance.Unfortunately', 'where', 'movie', 'flaws', 'begin', 'develop', 'Grace', 'character', 'never', 'really', 'fully', 'explored', 'character', 'lost', 'love', 'two', 'quickly', 'fall', 'love', 'consideration', 'consequences', 'love', 'Also', 'Grace', 'come', 'off', 'annoying', 'instead', 'charming', 'act', 'same', 'way', 'role', 'Other', 'characters', 'such', 'high', 'school', 'friend', 'played', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Mystic', 'River', 'ex-husband', 'played', 'great', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'become', 'just', 'side', 'aspects', 'plot', 'learn', 'Harden', 'character', 'now', 'married', 'bored', 'housewife', 'also', 'had', 'relationship', 'dead', 'high', 'school', 'artist', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'Byrne', 'having', 'sexual', 'addiction', 'cheating', 'Linney', 'were', 'married', ""n't"", 'further', 'explored', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Linney', 'brother', 'also', 'recovering', 'addict', 'more', 'phone-in', 'performance', 'real', 'character.The', 'movie', 'make', 'up', 'flaws', 'solid', 'performance', 'Linney', 'who', 'impress', 'role', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'romance', 'even', 'pretty', 'good', 'drama', 'slow', 'have', 'holes', 'plot', 'performances', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'what', 'lacks.The', 'movie', 'sort', 'bare', 'bones', 'when', 'special', 'features', 'consist', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'film', 'previews', 'Head', 'Clouds', 'House', 'Flying', 'Daggers', 'also', 'five', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'adding', 'relationship', 'Linney', 'Grace', 'have', 'optional', 'commentary', 'director', 'couple', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'such', 'pool', 'game', 'bar', 'where', 'Linney', 'Grace', 'friends', 'are', 'two', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'relationship', 'taking', 'form', 'exploring', 'Linney', 'life.Again', 'movie', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'love', 'story', 'ever', 'told', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching']",P.S.

I guess I was expecting something like, well, P.S. I Love You with Hillary Swank but anyway, I didn't let those feelings ruin the screening of the movie.I was waiting and waiting and waiting....and waiting for SOMETHING in this movie to happen, but it never did. It is UNbelievably boring, and it seems like nothing ever happens in it.Someone described in the reviews here that the story is a feel-good one, about something too good to be true. Well you know what? Nobody in this movie made me feel like this was that kind of story. Laura Linney is a very good actress, and so Topher Grace, but they didn't conveny any emotion at all. There is not even a really subtle reaction to the discovery that this guy is her long-dead ex boyfriend. You'd think that would warrant a facial reaction that moves you, tears, something. Not even Marcia Gay Harden's character seems to show any of these reactions. I mean, what the heck happens in this movie? Laura Linney finds a guy who is a freaking copy of her dead high school boyfriend, not only looks-wise, but also his behaviour and everything else. She begins dating him (having sex mere hours after meeting him). You would think that would make you show some emotion if it happened to you, right? Well not in this movie. It's like we're in some parallel universe were emotions are so pass&eacute;, kinda like Beneath The Planet Of The Apes where talking is so rudimental that people communicate telepathically.Not only didn't I feel engaged at all in this movie (except in the intro where Laura Linney is applying make-up: kinda says it all lol), I was so bored I almost fell asleep.I can understand this MAY not be the big movie where every sentiment has to be scored by John Williams, but come on!

874033,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0006TL806,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","`P.S.' is a sweet tale of romance, but the initial setting of the story is as plausible as that of `Ghost.' Or less, maybe, for ghost may come to you, but no admissions officer working for university would do the same thing as Louise of this film, played by ever-reliable Laura Linney. But you MUST believe that part, and only then you will be attracted to the romantic relations depicted in this little charming film.Laura Linney plays Louise, a divorced Columbia University School of Fine Arts admissions officer. In the opening chapter you will see the way her life is going on. It is routine, you can sense it in her conversation with her ex-husband (Gabriel Byrne). If you are not sure she is unfulfilled emotionally, it is obvious that Louise, reaching 40, does not look like a heroine of romance.But all these things change when Louise happens to notice that one of the applicants' letters has the same name on it as her ex-boyfriend - it was 20 years ago -- and guess what she does next. Louise calls F. Scott (that's the name of the applicant), asks him to come over to her office at University, and arranges to interview him without telling anyone else about it.F. Scott (Topher Grace) shows up, and their romance begins. (I don't write how, but you must see it for yourself). As you know, there are interesting aspects about their romance, like, which of them seizes the initiative of their relations, and Dylan Kidd tactfully suggests the power game played by them in such scenes as the one in which Louise teaches F. Scott how to tie his necktie. The story is told from the viewpoint of Louise, but it is easy to imagine how F. Scott, clearly uncomfortable at first, would feel before the admission officer who is coming onto him, displaying her cleavage in her office.`P.S.' is clever in showing these details, and the supporting characters are also largely interesting (and very eccentric). Marcia Gay Harden nearly steals the show, but it is Laura Linney and Topher Grace who is the real star of the film, making it very endearing and likable..Unfortunately, however, `P.S.' never makes us forget that the premise is too unorthodox, demanding too much from us. You may call it philosophical, metaphorical, or psychological, but one scene which happens earlier in the story is simply embarrassing not because its subject matter but because it is totally impossible in more than one way.I liked the acting from the leads, and the May-December romance between them.

I found it to be quite fast paced and the characters were all intriguing (well, except one, but more about that later).Laura Linney is wonderful playing Louise, a divorced college admissions officer in her late 30s, who meets a younger man (F.Scott, in his early 20s) who has the same name and characteristics as a young lover of hers who died in a car accident many years before. The film explores the relationship between Louise and F.Scott. The relationship between the two was interesting and entertaining, but I couldn't help wishing they'd got to know each other a bit better. Instead, they have sex about an hour after meeting, so it's difficult to see if they really are compatible or there is something special between them.I especially enjoyed the relationship between Louise and her ex-husband Peter, played by Gabriel Byrne. I recently saw Linney and Byrne playing a wife / husband couple in the film Jindabyne, and they work really well together and seem very natural. Peter is a reformed sex addict who has been getting help from Louise's brother Sammy, himself a reformed addict (a small role brilliantly [played by Paul Rudd). The relationships between Louise and Peter / Sammy and Louise's mother were very well done, and I liked the way they showed the bigger picture about Louise's life and how she relates to different people.The one thing about the film I'm not really sold on is the character of Missy, Louise's best friend. She is very much a stereotypical character - think Gabrielle from Desperate Housewives. She is the typical sex-pot with really over-the-top voice, sexual innuendos and short skirts. Her character simply wasn't written with any depth. She was just about redeemed, however, but her penultimate scene with Louise when they both talk about the feelings they had for Scott 20 years ago.Overall, I really enjoyed this film and thought it was a good character study. It's a romance and family drama rolled into one. It goes off on a tangent a few times, and certain things aren't explained at the end, but if you like subtle, thought-provoking films then this is definitely worth watching. And of course it's a must-see for Laura Linney fans - she carries the whole film and makes Louise a sympathetic and interesting character.",4,Very Enjoyable,1185235200,"07 24, 2007",2007,2362,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'lot', 'made', 'cry', 'laugh', 'gave', 'few', 'things', 'think', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'fast', 'paced', 'characters', 'were', 'intriguing', 'well', 'one', 'more', 'later', '.Laura', 'Linney', 'wonderful', 'playing', 'Louise', 'divorced', 'college', 'admissions', 'officer', 'late', '30s', 'who', 'younger', 'man', 'F.Scott', 'early', '20s', 'who', 'same', 'name', 'characteristics', 'young', 'lover', 'hers', 'who', 'died', 'car', 'accident', 'many', 'years', 'film', 'relationship', 'Louise', 'F.Scott', 'relationship', 'two', 'was', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wishing', ""'d"", 'got', 'know', 'other', 'bit', 'better', 'Instead', 'have', 'sex', 'hour', 'meeting', 'difficult', 'see', 'really', 'are', 'compatible', 'something', 'special', 'them.I', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'relationship', 'Louise', 'ex-husband', 'Peter', 'played', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'recently', 'saw', 'Linney', 'Byrne', 'playing', 'wife', '/', 'husband', 'couple', 'film', 'Jindabyne', 'work', 'really', 'well', 'together', 'seem', 'very', 'natural', 'Peter', 'reformed', 'sex', 'addict', 'who', 'been', 'getting', 'help', 'Louise', 'brother', 'Sammy', 'reformed', 'addict', 'small', 'role', 'brilliantly', '[', 'played', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'relationships', 'Louise', 'Peter', '/', 'Sammy', 'Louise', 'mother', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'liked', 'way', 'showed', 'bigger', 'picture', 'Louise', 'life', 'how', 'different', 'people.The', 'one', 'thing', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sold', 'character', 'Missy', 'Louise', 'best', 'friend', 'very', 'much', 'stereotypical', 'character', 'think', 'Gabrielle', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'typical', 'sex-pot', 'really', 'over-the-top', 'voice', 'sexual', 'innuendos', 'short', 'skirts', 'character', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'written', 'depth', 'was', 'just', 'about', 'redeemed', 'however', 'penultimate', 'scene', 'Louise', 'when', 'talk', 'feelings', 'had', 'Scott', '20', 'years', 'ago.Overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'character', 'study', 'romance', 'family', 'drama', 'rolled', 'one', 'off', 'tangent', 'few', 'times', 'certain', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'explained', 'end', 'like', 'subtle', 'thought-provoking', 'films', 'then', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'course', 'must-see', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'fans', 'whole', 'film', 'Louise', 'sympathetic', 'interesting', 'character']",P.S.

Marshall,"[6, 6]","This film is a romance with a twist even a touch quirky but well worth viewing for both the writing and acting.Louise Harrington (Laura Linney) is a 39 year old college admissions worker. Her marriage/divorce from Professor Peter Harrington (Gabriel Byrne) is amicable but as friends new incidents that occurred during their marriage are revealed which throw Louise off kilter. Almost at the same time a young art student appears with the name F. Scott Feinstadt (Topher Grace) and his name is not the only coincidence to an old love who passed away. Searching for connection Louise interviews F. Scott and a May-December relationship begins but not without its faults. Does Louise love F. Scott or the memory of another man? Add to the flame her best friend Missy Goldberg (Marcia Gay Harden) who encourages the memory and adds to the mess.Laura Linney is wonderful in her role as a woman with a re-ignited flame. Opposite Linney is Marcia Gay Harden as the stalking greedy best friend always looking to one up Linney. Gabriel Byrne does a great job as a troubled professor who can't seem to figure out his true heart. And Topher Grace accomplishes the naive student role extremely well however for my tastes he isn't the perfect romantic lead...a little too boyish in my opinion and a sort of creepy. But the idea is certainly interesting. Is it re-incarnation, mistaken identity or just a strange coincidence luckily it is all explained in the end.P.S.......Not sure this film would have worked if the gender roles had been reversed!",4,One More Thing.....,1124928000,"08 25, 2005",2005,1536,"['film', 'romance', 'twist', 'even', 'touch', 'quirky', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing', 'writing', 'acting.Louise', 'Harrington', 'Laura', 'Linney', '39', 'year', 'old', 'college', 'admissions', 'worker', 'marriage/divorce', 'Professor', 'Peter', 'Harrington', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'amicable', 'friends', 'new', 'incidents', 'occurred', 'marriage', 'are', 'revealed', 'throw', 'Louise', 'off', 'kilter', 'same', 'time', 'young', 'art', 'student', 'name', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Feinstadt', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'name', 'not', 'only', 'coincidence', 'old', 'love', 'who', 'passed', 'away', 'Searching', 'connection', 'Louise', 'interviews', 'F.', 'Scott', 'May-December', 'relationship', 'begins', 'not', 'faults', 'Does', 'Louise', 'love', 'F.', 'Scott', 'memory', 'man', 'Add', 'flame', 'best', 'friend', 'Missy', 'Goldberg', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'who', 'memory', 'mess.Laura', 'Linney', 'wonderful', 'role', 'woman', 're-ignited', 'flame', 'Opposite', 'Linney', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'stalking', 'greedy', 'best', 'friend', 'always', 'looking', 'one', 'up', 'Linney', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'great', 'job', 'troubled', 'professor', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'figure', 'out', 'true', 'heart', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'naive', 'student', 'role', 'extremely', 'well', 'however', 'tastes', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'romantic', 'lead', 'little', 'too', 'boyish', 'opinion', 'sort', 'creepy', 'idea', 'certainly', 'interesting', 're-incarnation', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'just', 'strange', 'coincidence', 'luckily', 'explained', 'end.P.S', '.Not', 'sure', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'gender', 'roles', 'had', 'been', 'reversed']",P.S.
