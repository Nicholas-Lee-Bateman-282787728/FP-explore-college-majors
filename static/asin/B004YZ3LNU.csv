The music is oppressive, Linda's character is tragic, and the supporting cast of young ladies don't seem to add much to this film to me (despite the fact that they are essential, considering the setting). Linda was, and always will be, beautiful, and she is a real doll in this film. However, there is not that much pleasant going on here, despite whatever good drama that the situation might make for. I still have to give it 4 stars for Linda alone.The Hen's Tooth DVD is top notch, though, and the film is uncut (which, despite what perverts might think, is not the best way to view the film, although as a completest I suppose I am glad that the film is finally restored).
