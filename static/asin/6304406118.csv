The costume party was the best scene in the movie.  Though I knew the basic plotline of the story, the dialogue was very strange, and the things that happened in it reminded me of a cross between the Monkees' Head (decidedly worse), and a colorless acid trip.  Dave Clark's character was too moody and self-righteous.  I'm guessing that's not far off the mark considering a lot of people think he's that way in real life (see reviews for the double disc History of the DC5 collection).  The Meat for Go girl had an annoying voice like a little mouse, and the rest of the band was almost non-existent save for party scenes.  All this conspires to make a movie that's nowhere as entertaining as Help!, try to be though it might, and there were only snippets of most of the band's songs.  Pretty boring, I wouldn't watch it again, and that's really too bad, but I have their music, and that's a positive.

Goodman,"[2, 2]","It's unfair to compare the music of the Dave Clark Five to the Beatles, of course, but when it comes to the movie itself, it's far superior to A Hard Day's Night.  Having A Wild Weekend (or Catch Us If You Can) is beautifully shot, skillfully edited, brimming with British wit, adsurdist humor, and has a real sense of integrity, even (dare I use the word?) existentialism.  I respected the ending, too, when ""Dave"" turns his back on cynical commercialism...and enjoyed the ""hip strangeness"" of the rest of the band, as actors.  I guess that, when this movie first screened, it had the unfortunate timing of going against Beatlemania at its height, and so was ignored and/or dismissed.  But having recently viewed this film, I was extremely impressed, never bored.  It has much more substance than A Hard Day's Night.

419580,A3Q83VI243WI7U,6304406118,Michael Topper,"[2, 2]","I was simply shocked at how good ""Having A Wild Weekend"" was after seeing it for the first time recently.  The DC5's film borrows the fast pace, ingenious cuts, sense of sprightly enthusiasm and b&w; artiness of ""A Hard Day's Night"", but matches it with a unique plot of its own. Rather than playing themselves, the group here are stuntmen, and the story revolves around one of them (Steve, played by the self-described saturnine Dave Clark) taking a model out for a ""wild weekend"". The press, egged on by her boss, turn it into a kidnapping story, and the rest of the film follows their attempt to recapture her before she gets to the island she's planning to buy. A suitably thin plot is thickened by scenes which are slightly ahead of their time in dramatic and culturalcontent--Steve and his girl encounter a group of long-haired ex-beatniks who ask for grass and heroin, and quote Zen koans-- and all of this in 1965! A comically bickering couple who eventually takes them in also provides for a marvellous costume party sequence in which director John Boorman, in his first film, shines. The climax, in which the journey is compared to the final result, makes for an interesting discussion; the film's themes of youth vs. elders, people vs. the press/society and the resulting question of whether it was ""worth it"" or not would become the riding question of the 60s. It's almost like an ""Easy Rider"" before its time-- the big question then becomes why the DC5 faded soon after this film's release, not being known as counterculture heavies in the least...",4,The Dave Clark Five Do Their Own Thing,994377600,"07 6, 2001",2001,1561,"['was', 'simply', 'shocked', 'how', 'good', 'Having', 'Wild', 'Weekend', 'was', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'recently', 'DC5', 'film', 'fast', 'pace', 'ingenious', 'cuts', 'sense', 'sprightly', 'enthusiasm', 'b', 'w', 'artiness', 'A', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'unique', 'plot', 'own', 'Rather', 'playing', 'group', 'here', 'are', 'stuntmen', 'story', 'one', 'Steve', 'played', 'self-described', 'saturnine', 'Dave', 'Clark', 'taking', 'model', 'out', 'wild', 'weekend', 'press', 'egged', 'boss', 'turn', 'kidnapping', 'story', 'rest', 'film', 'attempt', 'recapture', 'island', 'planning', 'buy', 'suitably', 'thin', 'plot', 'thickened', 'scenes', 'are', 'slightly', 'ahead', 'time', 'dramatic', 'culturalcontent', 'Steve', 'girl', 'encounter', 'group', 'long-haired', 'ex-beatniks', 'who', 'ask', 'grass', 'heroin', 'quote', 'Zen', 'koans', '1965', 'comically', 'bickering', 'couple', 'who', 'eventually', 'also', 'marvellous', 'costume', 'party', 'sequence', 'director', 'John', 'Boorman', 'first', 'film', 'shines', 'climax', 'journey', 'compared', 'final', 'result', 'interesting', 'discussion', 'film', 'themes', 'youth', 'vs.', 'elders', 'people', 'vs.', 'press/society', 'resulting', 'question', 'was', 'worth', 'not', 'would', 'become', 'riding', 'question', '60s', 'almost', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'time', 'big', 'question', 'then', 'why', 'DC5', 'faded', 'soon', 'film', 'release', 'not', 'being', 'known', 'counterculture', 'heavies', 'least']",Having a Wild Weekend VHS
419581,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,6304406118,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[17, 18]","This film, which is a cross between A Hard Days Night and the Marx Brothers, focuses almost completely on Dave Clark as stuntman (and alleged kidnapper) Steve and his relationship with meat poster girl Dinah. The other four members of the band are in the background, partying at their pad, attending a fancy dress ball, and keeping the authorities on a wild goose chase while Steve and Dinah experience one adventure after another on their way to Dinah's dream island.  In fact, I don't think Lenny Davidson says one word throughout the picture.  On their way they meet a group of half-stoned beatniks, an eccentric older couple, and other interesting folks.  The film tries to bring depth to most of the characters, except the Dave Clark 4 who remain rather vacuous fun boys.  At the time, the Dave Clark Five were promoted as a cleaner cut, non-smoking, drug-free and athletic alternative to the Beatles (probably only the latter was true, as the band members were former gymnists).  Clark's character (strong silent type, serious and rather surly to the point of self righteous) portrays this image quite well.  The film highlights two songs off their soundtrack beginning with the original movie title ""Catch Us If You Can"" and the U.S. title ""Having A Wild Weekend"". Two other songs are played from their previous album Coast To Coast: ""I Can't Stand It,"" and the quite beautiful ""When,"" which seemed to be the theme song of the film.  Curiously, other tracks from the soundtrack that would have been very appropriate for the film (""Don't Be Taken In,"" in particular) were not used. The music, save for ""When"", isn't their best material, but it's not bad.  The acting is also quite good.  British comedy fans will no doubt recognize Clive Swift (Hyacinth's hen-pecked husband Richard in Keeping Up Appearances) as a bumbling detective out to find the ""kidnapped"" Meat For Go girl.",3,"More Like ""Dave Clark 1""",1035763200,"10 28, 2002",2002,1885,"['film', 'cross', 'A', 'Hard', 'Days', 'Night', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'almost', 'completely', 'Dave', 'Clark', 'stuntman', 'alleged', 'kidnapper', 'Steve', 'relationship', 'meat', 'poster', 'girl', 'Dinah', 'other', 'four', 'members', 'band', 'are', 'background', 'partying', 'pad', 'attending', 'fancy', 'dress', 'ball', 'keeping', 'authorities', 'wild', 'goose', 'chase', 'Steve', 'Dinah', 'experience', 'one', 'adventure', 'way', 'Dinah', 'dream', 'island', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Lenny', 'Davidson', 'one', 'word', 'picture', 'way', 'meet', 'group', 'half-stoned', 'beatniks', 'eccentric', 'older', 'couple', 'other', 'interesting', 'folks', 'film', 'tries', 'bring', 'depth', 'most', 'characters', 'Dave', 'Clark', '4', 'who', 'remain', 'rather', 'vacuous', 'fun', 'boys', 'time', 'Dave', 'Clark', 'Five', 'were', 'promoted', 'cleaner', 'cut', 'non-smoking', 'drug-free', 'athletic', 'alternative', 'Beatles', 'probably', 'only', 'latter', 'was', 'true', 'band', 'members', 'were', 'former', 'gymnists', 'Clark', 'character', 'strong', 'silent', 'type', 'serious', 'rather', 'surly', 'point', 'righteous', 'image', 'quite', 'well', 'film', 'highlights', 'two', 'songs', 'soundtrack', 'beginning', 'original', 'movie', 'title', 'Catch', 'Us', 'Can', 'U.S.', 'title', 'Having', 'Wild', 'Weekend', 'Two', 'other', 'songs', 'are', 'played', 'previous', 'album', 'Coast', 'Coast', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Stand', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'When', 'seemed', 'be', 'theme', 'song', 'film', 'Curiously', 'other', 'tracks', 'soundtrack', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'appropriate', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Taken', 'particular', 'were', 'not', 'used', 'music', 'save', 'When', ""n't"", 'best', 'material', 'not', 'bad', 'acting', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'British', 'comedy', 'fans', 'will', 'doubt', 'recognize', 'Clive', 'Swift', 'Hyacinth', 'hen-pecked', 'husband', 'Richard', 'Keeping', 'Up', 'Appearances', 'bumbling', 'detective', 'find', 'kidnapped', 'Meat', 'Go', 'girl']",Having a Wild Weekend VHS

Herman's Hermits had a bit part inWhen The Boys Meet The Girls  (Remastered), then made two movies of their own:Hold On! [Remaster] andMrs. Brown You've Got A Lovely Daughter [Remaster]. Gerry And The Pacemakers starred inFerry Cross The Mersey-Starring Gerry and the Pacemakers-DVD. The Dave Clark Five made a cameo appearance in the less-than successfulGet Yourself A College Girl [Remaster], and then made their full-length film debut in the 1965 Warner Brothers movie,Having A Wild Weekend, also known asCatch Us If You Can. According to Dave Clark, the reason for the title change, as stated in the liner notes in the 1993 CD releaseThe History of the Dave Clark Five, was that the original title, CATCH US IF YOU CAN, was too close to a registered Broadway play title called CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, so Warner Brothers got cold feet and changed the film's U.S. title to another DC5 song in the film, HAVING A WILD WEEKEND. Ironically, the Broadway play never materialized, though a Leonardo DiCaprio film calledCatch Me If You Can (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)was released in 2002.Unfortunately, the DC5's film debut was very disappointing. The thin plot revolves around the filming of a TV commercial for meat, and Dave (his character Steve) and his model girlfriend (Barbara Ferris) trying to get away from it all. The best moments are the DC5 songs appearing on the soundtrack: the two title songs, plus ""When"" (the film's love theme), ""Ol' Sol,"" ""Move On,"" ""Reelin' and Rockin',"" and a few others. The film did mark the directorial debut of John Boorman, who went on to a successful career withDeliverance (Deluxe Edition), among others.It's not a horrible film, but it's not a comedy classic like A HARD DAY'S NIGHT.

Risoli ""black farmer""","[11, 11]","The American title of the Dave Clark Five's movie, ""Having a Wild Weekend"" seems to utilize a bit of the advertising menace which makes a great amount of the plot of their film, known in Great Britain and previously available under that title, ""Catch Us If You Can.""  ""Having a Wild Weekend"" kind of draws attention to the Beatles' first movie, ""A Hard Day's Night.""  So, as the adage goes, what's good for the gander.  The Warner Archive has now brought us an American DVD of the film which is the first movie for director, John Boorman who would very soon later helm the fabulous ""Point Blank"" starring Lee Marvin and Angie Dickinson, and also later ""Deliverance,"" ""Excalibur"" and ""The Emerald Forest,"" all very fine motion pictures.  I would not say ""Having a Wild Weekend"" is superior to the Beatles' movie(s) directed by Richard Lester, but they were certainly given due accolades at the time they were released.  The Dave Clark Five movie, thanks to Warner Archive, is getting some new insight by reviewers about its message and many of the ideas and ways that it skewers in a perhaps at times more original than simply imitating the Beatles' antics.  It is my opinion that the music of the Dave Clark Five, especially in the beginning, is extremely good listening.  Barbara Ferris, Dave Clark's female co-star, sort of became a minor sensation, starring afterward opposite Oskar Werner in the film, ""Interlude"" (now available as a Columbia Classic).  I found her to be well cast in ""Having a Wild Weekend"" and she adds to the film's power as commentary on the times, both then and now.  In the eighties, one of the cable stations featured restored versions of ""A Hard Day's Night,"" ""Help!"" the making of documentary: ""You Can't Do That: the Making of 'A Hard Day's Night'"" and ""Having a Wild Weekend"" which I had taped, but they were destroyed in flood waters.  Warner Archive's edition begins and ends with considerable scratches and deterioration, but it is only the credits, and the movie itself is very good quality.
