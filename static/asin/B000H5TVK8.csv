1009323,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000H5TVK8,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 4]","Blackwater Valley Exorcism isn't a very good movie, but I'll be danged if it didn't cram more crazy plot twists into it than any exorcism movie I've ever seen.  Every character in this film is so eaten up with his/her own personal demons that it's a wonder a bona fide demon could ever find room to get in and actually possess one of them in the first place.  As we all know, a demon will exploit any guilt and weakness in those who dare attempt to exorcise him; well, this demon is sitting on a mountain of ammunition once the collars start calling.  Some of you are undoubtedly wondering if the film is scary.  Personally, I have never seen anything scary aboutThe Exorcist (The Version You've Never Seen), but I'm pretty confident in saying Blackwater Valley Exorcism isn't going to scare a living soul the least little bit.  It will make you laugh, but it won't scary you.  As for my fellow Jeffrey Combs fans, you should already be used to Combs making cameo appearances in lousy horror films.  In most cases, he's the only thing the film has going for it.  In this case, however - and I really hate to say this - he turns in a terrible performance.  He was so bad that I didn't even realize it was him at the time.Blackwater Valley is obviously a hotbed of dysfunctional people.  You would think that poor demon-possessed Isabelle (Kristin Erickson) would be worse off than anyone else, but that is far from the case.  Her father Eli (Randy Colton) is all kinds of surly, carries a grudge like a sledgehammer, and is borderline psychotic with jealousy and suspicion of a wife he probably doesn't even love.  There's Miguel, the farmhand with a hidden past whose diagnosis of Isabelle as possessed pretty much gets the whole exorcism ball rolling.  Then there's the priest (Cameron Daddo), the most-screwed up character of all.  It is most ironic that the family turns to him for help because a previous relationship he had with Isabelle's sister has left plenty of bad blood between him and the family.  Let's just say Father Jacob didn't take a traditional path toward the priesthood.  He also happens to look a lot like Neil Diamond.Just picture this exorcism party: a priest with a really sordid past who just turned down a chance to study exorcism at the Vatican because he didn't believe in possession; a cowardly Mexican farmhand who repudiated his faith years earlier; Isabelle's sister Claire (Madison Taylor), who is, quite inexplicably, still all hot and bothered over Father Jacob; and a local veterinarian who just proved that a syringe full of horse tranquilizer won't kill a man.  Many a dark secret is revealed before this night is through - heck, you almost forget about poor possessed Isabelle as a full-fledged soap opera erupts inside the house.I like the story's unconventional twists and turns, as they do distinguish this particular film from the pack of Exorcist clones that have been produced over the years, but the film's mixed bag of surprises just isn't enough offset all of the inane dialogue and hysterically bad acting in the film.  It's impossible to take this film seriously, especially with Randy Colton turning in a performance worthy of the Hayden Christensen bad acting award of the year.  An exorcism movie with very little in the way of dark atmosphere and no capacity for frightening the viewer just isn't going to get the job done.  Blackwater Valley Exorcism is good for a few laughs, but that's about it.",2,Is this an exorcism or a daytime soap opera?,1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,3453,"['Blackwater', 'Valley', 'Exorcism', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'danged', 'did', ""n't"", 'cram', 'more', 'crazy', 'plot', 'twists', 'exorcism', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'character', 'film', 'so', 'eaten', 'up', 'his/her', 'own', 'personal', 'demons', 'wonder', 'bona', 'fide', 'demon', 'could', 'ever', 'find', 'room', 'get', 'actually', 'possess', 'one', 'first', 'place', 'know', 'demon', 'will', 'exploit', 'guilt', 'weakness', 'who', 'dare', 'attempt', 'exorcise', 'well', 'demon', 'sitting', 'mountain', 'ammunition', 'collars', 'start', 'calling', 'are', 'undoubtedly', 'wondering', 'film', 'scary', 'Personally', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'scary', 'aboutThe', 'Exorcist', 'Version', ""'ve"", 'Never', 'Seen', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'confident', 'saying', 'Blackwater', 'Valley', 'Exorcism', ""n't"", 'going', 'scare', 'living', 'soul', 'least', 'little', 'bit', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'wo', ""n't"", 'scary', 'fellow', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'fans', 'should', 'already', 'be', 'used', 'Combs', 'making', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'lousy', 'horror', 'films', 'most', 'cases', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'going', 'case', 'however', 'really', 'hate', 'say', 'terrible', 'performance', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'was', 'time.Blackwater', 'Valley', 'obviously', 'hotbed', 'dysfunctional', 'people', 'would', 'think', 'poor', 'demon-possessed', 'Isabelle', 'Kristin', 'Erickson', 'would', 'be', 'worse', 'anyone', 'else', 'far', 'case', 'father', 'Eli', 'Randy', 'Colton', 'kinds', 'surly', 'grudge', 'sledgehammer', 'borderline', 'psychotic', 'jealousy', 'suspicion', 'wife', 'probably', ""n't"", 'even', 'love', 'Miguel', 'farmhand', 'hidden', 'past', 'diagnosis', 'Isabelle', 'possessed', 'pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'exorcism', 'ball', 'rolling', 'Then', 'priest', 'Cameron', 'Daddo', 'most-screwed', 'up', 'character', 'most', 'ironic', 'family', 'help', 'previous', 'relationship', 'had', 'Isabelle', 'sister', 'left', 'plenty', 'bad', 'blood', 'family', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'Father', 'Jacob', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'traditional', 'path', 'priesthood', 'also', 'look', 'lot', 'Neil', 'Diamond.Just', 'picture', 'exorcism', 'party', 'priest', 'really', 'sordid', 'past', 'who', 'just', 'turned', 'down', 'chance', 'study', 'exorcism', 'Vatican', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'possession', 'cowardly', 'Mexican', 'farmhand', 'who', 'repudiated', 'faith', 'years', 'earlier', 'Isabelle', 'sister', 'Claire', 'Madison', 'Taylor', 'who', 'quite', 'inexplicably', 'still', 'hot', 'bothered', 'Father', 'Jacob', 'local', 'veterinarian', 'who', 'just', 'proved', 'syringe', 'full', 'horse', 'tranquilizer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'kill', 'man', 'dark', 'secret', 'revealed', 'night', 'heck', 'almost', 'forget', 'poor', 'possessed', 'Isabelle', 'full-fledged', 'soap', 'opera', 'erupts', 'house.I', 'story', 'unconventional', 'twists', 'turns', 'do', 'distinguish', 'particular', 'film', 'pack', 'Exorcist', 'clones', 'have', 'been', 'produced', 'years', 'film', 'mixed', 'bag', 'surprises', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough', 'offset', 'inane', 'dialogue', 'hysterically', 'bad', 'acting', 'film', 'impossible', 'take', 'film', 'seriously', 'especially', 'Randy', 'Colton', 'turning', 'performance', 'worthy', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'bad', 'acting', 'award', 'year', 'exorcism', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'dark', 'atmosphere', 'capacity', 'frightening', 'viewer', 'just', ""n't"", 'going', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'Blackwater', 'Valley', 'Exorcism', 'good', 'few', 'laughs']",Blackwater Valley Exorcism

Don't get me wrong, this movie does have its good points and fun moments, but nothing at all spectacular.It has all the components necessary for a formula exorcism movie: the flawed family, the fallen Priest, the young possessed daughter. It uses all these pieces much the same way so many other movies of its type have. There are a few unexpected elements, such as just how flawed the townspeople really are, and a some love subplots that are slightly irregular, but nothing out of the ordinary to make you take notice. The same is true of the special effects. The standard pale skin, chapped lips, white eyes, and Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer-vampire make-up are used. Nothing that is scary or new in the special effects.The worst flaw in this movie is the ending. It looks like the writer didn't know how to end it at all, so they cobbled something together that wouldn't satisfy an English 101 professor. At the end, you're wondering, ok.... So what?There are better movies out there that deserve your time and money far more than this. If you want an exorcism movie you can't do better than the original Exorcist.

However, Kristin Erickson (Isabelle) plays her part as a demon filled girl to the max.  She has only been around since 2002, but deserves bigger roles than this.  Cameron Daddo who plays the Priest and can't seem to make up his mind if he wants to be a priest or have normal relations with his old girfriend.  James Russo is probably the best known cast member, but he has a very limited role as The Bishop, so don't expect too  much from him.  The other cast member you may recognize is Jeffrey Combs as the Sheriff.  Again, a rather limited role and one that doesn't add too much, if anything to the movie.

Right from the plot summary, I was predicting that this was a ripoff of The Exorcist and, to a point, it is. Sadly, this movie falls very short of that seminal classic. To me, this was one of those movies that seems promising enough within the first half, but by about the 40-minute mark, you can tell they just gave up completely on this film. There were some parts that I found, whether it was the intent of the creators or not (and I'm guessing not), to be quite comical. It also became too close to being a soap opera; there was a seemingly extraneous amount of characters with no satisfying back-story or development. To me, it felt as if they had set up everything for something big and exciting to happen, and then in the end gave up on it.
