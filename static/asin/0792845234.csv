152871,A3QC4SG7NA4ULG,0792845234,A reader,"[1, 1]","This lovely, bittersweet movie knocked my socks off when I saw it back in the day.  I own the earlier edition but was thrilled to receive this updated, two-disk edition.  The sound quality has been vastly improved.  And there are some great features, among them interviews with the leading ladies, Helen Shaver and Patricia Charbonneau, an in-depth look at the filming of the famous love scene, and most important, a new director's commentary by Donna Deitch which far surpasses the one on the earlier edition.  Deitch took her time in writing a commentary that provides background information concerning the making of the film and the individuals responsible for its success, from actors, to crew, even to the anonymous financial backers who got to appear in the film as extras gambling in the casino!  Deitch also discusses some of the choices she made in setting up scenes, music, casting, etc., giving us fascinating insights into the creative decision-making process that a director employs when putting together a movie.For those of you who are new to this wonderful film, ""Desert Hearts"" is peopled with believable, sympathetic characters and it is, for the most part, beautifully acted.  The soundtrack is fabulous.  The cinematography artfully features the haunting southwestern landscape, contrasting it with the period-perfect seediness of 1950's Reno.""Desert Hearts"" is a lesbian love story, but also a story about the importance of many types of relationships between women:  mother and daughter, friend and confidant.  I've seen almost all the lesbian flicks that have been produced over the years, and very few of them have this one's staying power.  It offers a romantic and heartfelt view of lesbian love in the old-fashioned Hollywood mold, something we rarely see in the movies, and never saw at all prior to the making of this landmark film.  The impeccable use of music is heard in the final scene, as Ella Fitzgerald croons ""I Wished On The Moon."" I can't imagine any person who has ever loved or hoped for love, whether they're gay, straight or in between, not being moved by the promise, longing and mystery expressed in that last scene.As a middle-aged lesbian who rates this as her favorite lesbian film of all time, I was particularly touched to hear Donna Deitch talk about her goal of making a truly romantic lesbian movie that didn't end in either a ""bisexual love triangle or a suicide.""  Despite the fact that I've watched this movie a hundred times, the romance never fails to grab me.  Donna, you succeeded beyond your wildest dreams.  And yes, Ms. Deitch does indeed confirm that a sequel is in the works.At the end of her commentary, Deitch requests that those of us who love the movie encourage others to buy this new edition.  So here's my pitch:  even if you own the earlier version, click ""Add to My Cart""!

It is about two real people which is what all books and movies should strive for. I have read the book and recommend it because it delves into more detail than the movie does and the movie is more an adaptation than a complete re-telling of the book. It is interesting to see what women had to go through to obtain a &quot;quickie&quot; divorce in 1959, to be exact. Helen Shaver is both strong and vulnerable as Vivien and Patricia Charbanneau a maverick who slowly reveals her vulnerability to the Helen Shaver character. Each gives the other the strength to be more herslf. THe DVD is of excellent quality and one of the extra fetures is a commentary by the director as the movie rolls on. I find that in most DVD's and find it distracting. I think it would be much better to let the director speak in person and show various scenes as she talks about them rather than reshowing the entire movie. I really hope they change that.

Also, the slow, intimate sex scene was very erotic, even more so because the director chose to eliminate a musical backdrop and focus on the two women's passionate breathing. Audra Lindley (Frances) also turned in a strong performance as Cay's alcoholic stepmother. Some of the supporting characters were weak (especially Cay's best friend) and some of the lines were lame.

This wonderful love story brings lesbian love into the light of day with beautiful women, looking and acting sexy, and leading productive, respectable lives. Vivian arrives in Reno to get a divorce, and meets free-spirited, self-assured Cay. The Reno landscape in the 50's is a great backdrop for the conflicts that lesbians encounter. This is a story about romantic love between women, mother-daughter relationship, and friendship. The filming is top notch, the sets and period clothing are spot on.  The musical scores (50's country and western) are superb and the cast was wonderful! Charbonneau and Shavers are sensational as total opposites who eventually become drawn and attrated to each other. Just a masterful duette of performances! Cay, free and fully out, forward and knowing just what she wants; Vivian, tentative and reluctant to step outside of her cultured and closed box.  Every minute they spend with each other oozes electricity and sexual tension. Two georgeous women making love?? HELLO! The love scene is landmark. Audra Lindley is wonderful and perfectly cast as Cay's stepmom. Cay's best friend, Silver, is absolutely a key (and skintillating!) role in the dynamics of these characters; she is the definative support and validation that these women are wonderful people, and deserve love and happiness.

Most of films portray the loving relationship between women ends up in sorrowful tragedy, often death by suicide or judicial imprisonment or even execution. I strongly believe that it is really unfair to label the attraction between women such as forbidden love affair.  What is really the harm they can cause to man kind? Practically none to be known of throughout human history. Men continue to jeopardise women's freedom to love for men's own egoistical problems that they want to own women.  I foresee that the end of human civilisation comes sooner if we do not correct our attitude. In fact, there have been more women on the earth than men.  Women should have had slightly larger ownership of this planet. There are 103 women for ever 100 men.  We have to give those 3 women impartial means of companionship. If they want to chose another woman. Let them pursue their freedom to do so. It was such a great relief for me that there were no cruelty such as intimidation or violence implied upon Cay and Vivian and that the film ended with some hope that they can meet again in the future. Cay's free spirited persona played by Patricia Charbonneau was awesome and refreshing. All these makes the film quite appealing and worthy of praise.Every female child has dreams of being swept up into a great adventure, of being the beautiful princess. Lamentably, when women grow up, they are often swept up into a life filled merely with demands, duty and responsibility. Many women are tired, struggling under the senseless pressure to be of a faithful servant, or a caregiver for children, husband or father and like.",4,It was such a great relief for me that there were no cruelty such as intimidation,1248912000,"07 30, 2009",2009,1738,"['woman', 'love', 'priceless', 'enlightenment', 'undeniably', 'superior', 'others', 'endurance', 'strength', 'wisdom', 'Most', 'films', 'portray', 'loving', 'relationship', 'women', 'up', 'sorrowful', 'tragedy', 'often', 'death', 'suicide', 'judicial', 'imprisonment', 'even', 'execution', 'strongly', 'believe', 'really', 'unfair', 'label', 'attraction', 'women', 'such', 'forbidden', 'love', 'affair', 'What', 'really', 'harm', 'can', 'cause', 'man', 'kind', 'Practically', 'none', 'be', 'known', 'human', 'history', 'Men', 'continue', 'jeopardise', 'women', 'freedom', 'love', 'men', 'own', 'egoistical', 'problems', 'want', 'own', 'women', 'foresee', 'end', 'human', 'civilisation', 'sooner', 'do', 'not', 'correct', 'attitude', 'fact', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'women', 'earth', 'men', 'Women', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'slightly', 'larger', 'ownership', 'planet', 'are', '103', 'women', 'ever', '100', 'men', 'have', 'give', '3', 'women', 'impartial', 'means', 'companionship', 'want', 'chose', 'woman', 'Let', 'pursue', 'freedom', 'do', 'so', 'was', 'such', 'great', 'relief', 'were', 'cruelty', 'such', 'intimidation', 'violence', 'implied', 'Cay', 'Vivian', 'film', 'ended', 'hope', 'can', 'meet', 'again', 'future', 'Cay', 'free', 'spirited', 'persona', 'played', 'Patricia', 'Charbonneau', 'was', 'awesome', 'refreshing', 'film', 'quite', 'appealing', 'worthy', 'praise.Every', 'female', 'child', 'dreams', 'being', 'swept', 'up', 'great', 'adventure', 'being', 'beautiful', 'princess', 'Lamentably', 'when', 'women', 'grow', 'up', 'are', 'often', 'swept', 'up', 'life', 'filled', 'merely', 'demands', 'duty', 'responsibility', 'Many', 'women', 'are', 'tired', 'struggling', 'senseless', 'pressure', 'be', 'faithful', 'servant', 'caregiver', 'children', 'husband', 'father']",N/A

It's not incredibly long, only being about an hour and a half long, but sometimes it drags too much during that time so that it seems like more time is passing than really does.  That's the biggest weakness in the whole story line, how long it takes for things to happen.The love scene between the two women in this film, when it finally happens, is strong, and plays out as being very real. It's some of the earlier scenes in the movie, and some of the rather stilted conversations they and other characters have, that bogs the movie down.  The shy glances exchanged between the two women early on, and even their first tentative kiss were well done, if only the dialogue had been more sharply written, or some of the needless prattling weeded out, the movie would have come across more true.I have to compliment the two lead actresses, Helen Shaver and Patricia Charbonneau, for being so effective in the intimate moments their characters experienced.  They did a good job of showing the love these two women shared without making it seem like a contrived love scene like in so many other movies.  They seemed to enjoy one another, as any couple does when they care about each other and are trying to please their mate.So, all things considered, I recommend seeing this movie, if you don't want to buy it, then at least try to find it to rent.  Except for a few long passages which bog down, the rest of the movie is enjoyable, and while not everything is wrapped up with a big bow at the end like in some movies, it is still satisfying, and remains true to the spirit of the rest of the film.",4,"Well acted, but not as well written",978566400,"01 4, 2001",2001,1692,"['have', 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'was', 'more', 'movie', 'liked', 'disliked', 'not', 'incredibly', 'long', 'only', 'being', 'hour', 'half', 'long', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'more', 'time', 'passing', 'really', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'whole', 'story', 'line', 'how', 'long', 'things', 'happen.The', 'love', 'scene', 'two', 'women', 'film', 'when', 'finally', 'strong', 'out', 'being', 'very', 'real', 'earlier', 'scenes', 'movie', 'rather', 'stilted', 'conversations', 'other', 'characters', 'have', 'movie', 'down', 'shy', 'glances', 'exchanged', 'two', 'women', 'early', 'even', 'first', 'tentative', 'kiss', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'only', 'dialogue', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'sharply', 'written', 'needless', 'prattling', 'weeded', 'out', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'more', 'true.I', 'have', 'compliment', 'two', 'lead', 'actresses', 'Helen', 'Shaver', 'Patricia', 'Charbonneau', 'being', 'so', 'effective', 'intimate', 'moments', 'characters', 'experienced', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'love', 'two', 'women', 'shared', 'making', 'seem', 'contrived', 'scene', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'seemed', 'enjoy', 'one', 'couple', 'when', 'care', 'other', 'are', 'trying', 'please', 'mate.So', 'things', 'considered', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'buy', 'then', 'least', 'try', 'find', 'rent', 'few', 'long', 'passages', 'bog', 'down', 'rest', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'everything', 'wrapped', 'up', 'big', 'bow', 'end', 'movies', 'still', 'satisfying', 'true', 'spirit', 'rest', 'film']",N/A
152894,AKEJE0HB5BST0,0792845234,Mark Lee,"[4, 4]","Vivian Bell (Helen Shaver) is a dry, sober New York professor of literature stuck in dry, sagebrushy 1959 Reno, Nevada in an attempt to meet the technical requirements for a divorce from a dry, emptily sad, but not unbearable marriage.  Yeah, there's a great deal of aridity here.  But it's beautiful.  This is a good story and it's my kind of country.  Early in the film, Vivian tells her divorce lawyer ""I want to be free of who I've been.""  This is a weighty line.  Vivian is distant and uptight, determined to keep to herself in Nevada long enough to get her divorce and leave.  She's a beautiful 35 year old woman who initially hides herself behind her academic ""uniform.""  In a delightful early scene, her first car ride with young Kay, she literally barricades herself behind her sunglasses.Cay Rivvers (Patricia Charbonneau) is vibrant and hungry, ten years Vivian's junior.  She's an open lesbian, eager to find someone to be with.  She senses something about Vivian and is attracted to her.  Cay is beautiful as she - in a charming scene - sits in a tub with her platonic, mature friend Silver and talks about her attraction to Vivian.  Her face is alive and she looks so happy.  She knows it's risky and is willing to put everything she has into it.  And this is their story as they step through the exciting difficulties of finding each other.  I'm not going to spoil the tale, although it's no spoiler to note that this movie is famous for an eventual love scene.  I'll just observe that I've never seen kissing as full, sensitive and passionate as that which I saw in this film.  It was spectacular.  And well-crafted.Frances (Audra Lindley) is Cay's stepmom and Walter's mom.  She's owner and head of the boarding dude ranch where Vivian is living for the month as she waits for her divorce.  Frances is stuck in a past in which she lives with the memory of Kay's dead father, Glen, the long-gone love of Francis' life.  In one scene in which Frances is dancing with Cay, the viewer knows intuitively that in a very real way for Francis, she's dancing with her dead lover.  Glen was also the father of Francis' only child, a son.Francis' late-teens son Walter (and Cay's half-brother, played by Alex McArthur) is a pleasant, attractive character.  ""Care for a Chiclette?""  My chief complaint is that he just sort of ends up being the charming ranch eunich.  This is a movie principally about relationships between women; tension and attraction between Vivian and Cay, between Cay and Francis, between Silver and Cay.  Still, I didn't feel that I ended up getting a complete enough picture of Walter.  Darrell, Cay's futilely smitten supervisor, and Joe, Silver's grand beau, were male characters also on the periphery whom I felt were better developed even though they had less screen time.The landscapes, townscapes, sets, hair and costumes were perfect.  Late 50s tunes, some country, also complement the visuals, be they part of the soundtrack or background noise on a cinematic radio.  Cowboy crooners, Ella Fitzgerald, Elvis, Patsy Cline, and such.  ""Let's pretend that we're together all alone.""I heartily recommend fans of the film take advantage of the DVD screenwriter/directory commentary with Donna Deitch.  There's a wealth of wonderful anecdotal stuff on there that will make the viewing experience of Desert Hearts even more meaningful.  The filmmaker sold her house so that she could finish this film!  There are so many wonderful stories here, and if you listen to Donna talk about her film, you even get a good story about her brief casino cameo role.",4,Life and Love in the Desert.

There she meets Cay (Patricia Charbonneau), a lusty, free-spirited casino worker.  The relationship between these two beautiful women is the focus of the film.""Desert Hearts"" is a wonderful film.  It's very erotic, tender, and moving.  The women's story is complemented by excellent production values and effective use of period music.  The performances are superb all around.

In fact, in several scenes, they steal the show. However, Helen Shaver's performance as Vivian Bell, the prim professor in search of a quickie divorce, set me on edge. Shaver walks around like she is perpetually constipated or has a stick shoved up her Summa Cum Laude derriere. Even when Vivian finally sexually succumbs to the luscious, free-spirited Cay (Charbonneau), Shaver's professor still is edgy and uptight. Can this woman ever relax?  Perhaps Shaver was not that comfortable in this role, the end result being a two-dimensional, emotionally wooden character. I would think that there'd be a substantial change in Vivian after she discovers her true sexuality and her love for Cay, but Shaver never breaks free of her stiff portrayal. If Shaver had shown more depth and warmth with her character, this would have been an excellent film.

( I've met women like this and Ms. Shaver'sdeft performance nails it).To see her slowly becomeunwound and unglued because her unrealized sexualitybegins to bloom,is a real treat.Patricia Charbonneau as the young lesbian at oddswith the world is also a very realistic performance.What I liked about this character is that she doesn'tjust go and hit on the prof.Instead,she yearns from afarand slowly begins to realize that the prof.may be ""THE ONE"".One would have thought that if they could make a movie likethis way back when,then the next 20 yrs.should be filledwith great lesbian movies.

With great craft and artistry, it tells a story of two seemingly mismatched people who fall in love - both, for the first time - and follows that story to a conclusion that's both honest and positive.  Made independently, it eschews the usual studio cop-outs of an unresolved bisexual triangle, suicide, or the ever-popular ""it was just a phase.""  The performances are uniformly solid, the cinematography is sharp and gorgeous, and even the period detail of 1959 Reno is spot-on throughout.  This is a lush and beautiful romance, and it's frankly amazing that there are so few other films like it.  A couple of decades before The Kids Are Alright and The L Word, this little film proved that there was (and still is) a market for this kind of material, but for some reason, no one's really exploiting it.

This is the raw footage from, argueably, the most famous lesbian love scene ever. We are not necessarily given more content, but simply the same content from different angles, over multiple takes.2. Commentary by director Donna Deitch. Fun and informative.3. Interviews with the two main stars by director Deitch. To me, this feature is worth the price of this collection. Donna Deitch interviews both Patricia Charbonneau ( Cay ) and Helen Shaver ( Vivian ). These are one-on-one sessions which recall memories of filming and, more importantly, the impact the film had on both actresses. These interview sessions were done in March 2007. The only thing that might have made them more interesting would have been if the actresses had actually been reunited for the interviews. They are each interviewed, separately, by Deitch. While both actresses are fun to watch, it is Helen Shaver and her insights that are the most rewarding.4.
