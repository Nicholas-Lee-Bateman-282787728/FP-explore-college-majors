The show not only is entertaining, but beyond that it shares some great messages about concepts like friendship, hard work and so much more. On top of this it shares some of the iconic Disney characters that all kids love! This DVD is another great mix of episodes that will keep you and your kids on their feet with some fun surprises in store.If you have never experienced this show, I highly recommend it to all families. If you have, I recommend this DVD as a great addition to your collection, as the episodes are fun and as always there is some great teamwork that happens throughout and the whole gang works together to solve whatever issue that is set in front of them (with the Mousekettools help of course).",5,A Great Addition to the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Collection,1355184000,"12 11, 2012",2012,828,"['youngest', 'daughter', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Clubhouse', 'parent', 'have', 'say', 'have', 'agree', 'show', 'not', 'only', 'entertaining', 'shares', 'great', 'messages', 'concepts', 'friendship', 'hard', 'work', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'top', 'shares', 'iconic', 'Disney', 'characters', 'kids', 'love', 'DVD', 'great', 'mix', 'episodes', 'will', 'keep', 'kids', 'feet', 'fun', 'surprises', 'store.If', 'have', 'never', 'experienced', 'show', 'highly', 'recommend', 'families', 'have', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'great', 'addition', 'collection', 'episodes', 'are', 'fun', 'always', 'great', 'teamwork', 'whole', 'gang', 'together', 'solve', 'issue', 'set', 'front', 'Mousekettools', 'help', 'course']",Mickey Mouse Clubhouse: Mickey & Donald Have a Farm

1598935,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B009M5014E,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[8, 8]","Actually, the DVD is called Mickey & Donald Have a Farm (as in ee -yi-ee-yi-yo). It's a collection from the Disney Junior CG-animated preschooler series, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.The signature episode, Mickey & Donald Have a Farm is presented along with other garden and home-related episodes, including:* Goofy's Petting Zoo* Clarabelle's Clubhouse Moo-sical* Goofy the Homemaker (Right on, Goofy! Shatter those stereotypes!!)* Donald Hatches the EggI love that Goofy refers to eggs as ""eggies"" in this episode, since that is what I do with my kids. We even bought one of those as-seen-on-TV gadgets called ""Eggies"" just because of the name (even though it really didn't work very well.One of the nicest things about Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, is that it brings Mickey and company to TV for young viewers as as warm, Dora-like friends, rather than only as park icons, corporate symbols, geometric shapes or an ""old"" characters. For many years, some kids grew up not knowing who Mickey was, or at least having a context into which they could have memories of him, so that's nice.The other thing that's great about the series is that we also see characters like Professor Ludwig Von Drake (voiced by the great Corey Burton), Clarabelle Cow (the multi-talented April Winchell) and others. It's important to keep these dear friends from becoming obscure friends.The package also includes a little garden kit with a package of seeds (I got lettuce), some fun facts and a set of character garden markers. Nice touch for a little more fun beyond the show watching itself.There's also a paperback companion book of Mickey & Donald Have a Farm, sold separately.",4,"""We Bought a Farm"" starring Mickey & Donald!",1356048000,"12 21, 2012",2012,1648,"['Actually', 'DVD', 'called', 'Mickey', 'Donald', 'Have', 'Farm', 'ee', '-yi-ee-yi-yo', 'collection', 'Disney', 'Junior', 'CG-animated', 'preschooler', 'series', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Clubhouse.The', 'signature', 'episode', 'Mickey', 'Donald', 'Have', 'Farm', 'presented', 'other', 'garden', 'home-related', 'episodes', 'including', '*', 'Goofy', 'Petting', 'Zoo*', 'Clarabelle', 'Clubhouse', 'Moo-sical*', 'Goofy', 'Homemaker', 'Right', 'Goofy', 'Shatter', 'stereotypes', '*', 'Donald', 'Hatches', 'EggI', 'love', 'Goofy', 'refers', 'eggs', 'eggies', 'episode', 'what', 'do', 'kids', 'even', 'bought', 'one', 'as-seen-on-TV', 'gadgets', 'called', 'Eggies', 'just', 'name', 'even', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'very', 'well.One', 'nicest', 'things', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Clubhouse', 'Mickey', 'company', 'TV', 'young', 'viewers', 'warm', 'Dora-like', 'friends', 'rather', 'only', 'park', 'icons', 'corporate', 'symbols', 'geometric', 'shapes', 'old', 'characters', 'many', 'years', 'kids', 'grew', 'up', 'not', 'knowing', 'who', 'Mickey', 'was', 'least', 'having', 'context', 'could', 'have', 'memories', 'nice.The', 'other', 'thing', 'great', 'series', 'also', 'see', 'characters', 'Professor', 'Ludwig', 'Von', 'Drake', 'voiced', 'great', 'Corey', 'Burton', 'Clarabelle', 'Cow', 'multi-talented', 'April', 'Winchell', 'others', 'important', 'keep', 'dear', 'friends', 'becoming', 'obscure', 'friends.The', 'package', 'also', 'little', 'garden', 'kit', 'package', 'seeds', 'got', 'lettuce', 'fun', 'facts', 'set', 'character', 'garden', 'markers', 'Nice', 'touch', 'little', 'more', 'fun', 'show', 'watching', 'itself.There', 'also', 'paperback', 'companion', 'book', 'Mickey', 'Donald', 'Have', 'Farm', 'sold', 'separately']",Mickey Mouse Clubhouse: Mickey & Donald Have a Farm
