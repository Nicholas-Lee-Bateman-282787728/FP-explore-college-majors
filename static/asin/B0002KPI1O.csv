838651,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B0002KPI1O,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[38, 42]","Being interested in many types of film, I saw the DVD release of Watermelon Man (1970) and it was the title that caught my eye.  Directed by African-American film pioneer Melvin Van Peebles and starring Godfrey Cambridge (The President's Analyst, Cotton Comes to Harlem) and Estelle Parsons (Bonnie and Clyde), Watermelon Man relates an interesting tale of what happens when a bigoted white man wakes one day to find his skin has since turned black.As the film begins, we meet the Gerbers, a typical white family living in a typical white neighborhood.  There's Jeff Gerber (Cambridge), the head of the family, who make his living selling insurance, Althea Gerber (Parsons), Jeff's somewhat liberal wife, and their two children.  One evening Jeff awakes to discover he's no longer white, and believes he suffering a bad dream.  This turns out not to be the case, as Jeff retains his new skin color into the next day.  He begins to look for answers, maybe it can be washed off if he showers for a lengthy period of time, or maybe the new color of his skin is attributed to spending too much time in his tanning bed, but there appears to be no real cause for what happened.  Unable to hide from the outside world forever, Jeff ventures back into his regular routine, and soon learns that the color of his skin isn't the only thing that's changed.  He finds racist attitudes prevalent throughout his workday and home life, as now, the system of which he used to be a part of, begins to turn on him, effectively forcing him to `walk a mile in another man's shoes'.I really enjoyed this different sort of film, as it was an unusual blend of satire and social commentary.  The writing was sharp and witty, and while this may not be a film for everyone, it does provide an interesting perspective, one that doesn't necessarily have to beat its' audience over the head (it does lay it on a little thick sometimes) with its' message.  Some of the funniest scenes developed in part to Jeff and his wife's initial reaction to his change like Jeff showering for a really, really long time, his reviewing the warranty contract on his tanning bed, and his somewhat liberal wife asking if she should hide the money and serving him fried chicken and watermelon for dinner (she may be a liberal, but she's one of those liberals who's main contact comes from what she sees on the TV).  Just think how you might act or be treated if one day you found that the color of you skin has changed, while you remain the same person on the inside.  Cambridge does a wonderful job as the main character, beginning as a slightly bigoted individual who sees how life is from the other side.  While a dislikable character in the beginning, I began to develop a sense of sympathy for him as the film progressed, not because his skin changed color, but because I felt he really began to understand the inherent differences in a system he worked in and was a part of for so long, and he understood flaws within his own character, now magnified in the attitudes and demeanor of people around him, his co-workers, family, friends, and community.  He sees his world is not a particularly nice place to live, that is if you are not of the right color.  The humor is pretty subtle, and doesn't seem to be prone to exaggeration, but more or less presented to mirror that of real life, as different forms of racism are presented, from the straight up type (the use of unpleasant racial terms and profiling by the police), to less obvious, more insidious forms in terms of accepted stereotypes and common misconceptions.  The direction was a bit weird at times, as different things are incorporated into the film, strange music, odd text, (reminded me of sort of safe psychedelia used in the Monkees television show, only not to that extent) but then the late 60's and early 70's tended to elicit this kind of experimentation, which, at the time, seemed completely new and far out, but now serves mainly to effectively date films containing such elements.  An interesting side note to the film, apparently the director received quite a bit of flak over his unwillingness to change the ending of the film.  The studio executives had wanted him to incorporate an ending in which the main character would wake up and find his original skin color had returned, and the whole affair was to be presented as if it were all a bad dream (which would have ruined the film, in my opinion).  Van Peebles resisted, and was finally able to keep his intended ending, maintaining his creative integrity and preserving the element that makes this film interesting and original.  Is it controversial?  I didn't get that feeling, although I will admit this movie probably isn't for everyone.Presented here is a really good looking wide screen version of the film, which runs approximately just over an hour and a half.  There really aren't any special features, not even a trailer, but there is an introduction by the director, Melvin Van Peebles, which can be chosen to play over the opening credits of the film.  All in all, an interesting, fairly funny perspective that still bears relevance today, some thirty plus years after its' original release.Cookieman108",4,His white bread world just got turned upside

838660,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B0002KPI1O,Robert I. Hedges,"[1, 1]","""Watermelon Man"" is Melvin Van Peebles' 1970 comedic satire about the state of race relations in America. While progress has been made since this film was made, the film still is relevant today if you can look past the horrible styles and occasionally over the top dialogue and lingo. Godfrey Cambridge stars as Jeff Gerber, an obnoxious white insurance salesman married to a liberal wife (Estelle Parsons) living the American dream. These two were made for their parts and pull them off perfectly, as does Howard Caine, who plays Jeff's prickly boss. You likely know Caine best from his role as Major Wolfgang Hochstetter on ""Hogan's Heroes."" This was done in the middle of ""Hogan's"" run, and the roles are not dissimilar.The film starts as a typical comedy of the era, and frankly is not terribly compelling until the race change scene, after which the social satire wins out (mostly) over overt comedy (occasionally odd music and title cards notwithstanding.) After Jeff's overnight race change, his wife discovers she's a liberal in name only (stopping to make him a dinner of fried chicken and watermelon in the film's least politically correct scene) and their marriage suffers, though Jeff has ultimate command of his destiny in negotiating shrew financial deals (particularly his home sale.)While the character of Jeff begins the film as a totally unsympathetic protagonist, as his life becomes more difficult it becomes easier and easier to sympathize with his plight, and he eventually wins the audience over. From accounts I have read, Van Peebles really had to fight for the conclusion with the studio, but he eventually won and the film is much better for him having realized his artistic vision. While ""Watermelon Man"" is not a perfect movie, has some occasionally grating moments (especially some occasional pre-change overacting from Cambridge,) and definitely isn't for everyone, the historical value and era-specific social commentary make this interesting viewing.",4,Groundbreaking For 1970; Still Relevant Today,1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2013,1983,"['Watermelon', 'Man', 'Melvin', 'Van', 'Peebles', '1970', 'comedic', 'satire', 'state', 'race', 'relations', 'America', 'progress', 'been', 'made', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'film', 'still', 'relevant', 'today', 'can', 'look', 'horrible', 'styles', 'occasionally', 'top', 'dialogue', 'lingo', 'Godfrey', 'Cambridge', 'Jeff', 'Gerber', 'obnoxious', 'white', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'married', 'liberal', 'wife', 'Estelle', 'Parsons', 'living', 'American', 'dream', 'two', 'were', 'made', 'parts', 'pull', 'off', 'perfectly', 'Howard', 'Caine', 'who', 'Jeff', 'prickly', 'boss', 'likely', 'know', 'Caine', 'best', 'role', 'Major', 'Wolfgang', 'Hochstetter', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'was', 'done', 'middle', 'Hogan', 'run', 'roles', 'are', 'not', 'dissimilar.The', 'film', 'typical', 'comedy', 'era', 'frankly', 'not', 'terribly', 'compelling', 'race', 'change', 'scene', 'social', 'satire', 'out', 'mostly', 'overt', 'comedy', 'occasionally', 'odd', 'music', 'title', 'cards', 'notwithstanding', 'Jeff', 'overnight', 'race', 'change', 'wife', 'liberal', 'name', 'only', 'stopping', 'make', 'dinner', 'fried', 'chicken', 'watermelon', 'film', 'least', 'politically', 'correct', 'scene', 'marriage', 'suffers', 'Jeff', 'ultimate', 'command', 'destiny', 'negotiating', 'shrew', 'financial', 'deals', 'particularly', 'home', 'sale', 'character', 'Jeff', 'film', 'totally', 'unsympathetic', 'protagonist', 'life', 'more', 'difficult', 'easier', 'easier', 'sympathize', 'plight', 'eventually', 'audience', 'accounts', 'have', 'read', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'really', 'had', 'fight', 'conclusion', 'studio', 'eventually', 'won', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'having', 'realized', 'artistic', 'vision', 'Watermelon', 'Man', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'occasionally', 'grating', 'moments', 'especially', 'occasional', 'pre-change', 'overacting', 'Cambridge', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'historical', 'value', 'era-specific', 'social', 'commentary', 'make', 'interesting', 'viewing']",N/A

838662,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B0002KPI1O,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[0, 0]","Most of the well-known social satires dealing with white-on-black racism share the same strange thing in common:  They're not written or directed by African Americans.  And while films like ""Blazing Saddles"" and television programs like ""All in the Family"" are hilarious and important for their own reasons, they don't seem quite as sincere, if that's the right word, as this film, arguably Melvin Van Peebles' best.The late, great Godfrey Cambridge (""The President's Analyst""; ""Cotton Comes to Harlem"") stars as Jeff Gerber, a middle-class American boor who delights in meaningless competition, keeping up with the Joneses, and chauvinism without consequences at the office -- in short, a fairly typical suburban guy.  His sexless but otherwise happy, narcissistic life has the sort of antiseptic order that probably didn't seem so offensive when Dwight Eisenhower and ""Leave It to Beaver"" were still more or less fresh in people's minds.  But his world is changed irrevocably when the bigoted but unimpeded Gerber awakens one morning to find himself indisputably no longer white -- and privileged -- but black -- and reviled.  Thus begins his firsthand experiences with the sort of overt and covert racism writers like Ralph Ellison and Chester Himes have described for years and Eddie Murphy would lampoon on ""Saturday Night Live,"" everything from co-workers suddenly no longer saying hello or bothering to make eye contact to being accused of crimes he didn't commit and barred entry to private clubs.The best thing about ""Watermelon Man"" is how it shows so much of the viciousness of prejudice rather than lectures or preaches, in a film that starts out broadly comedic but ends with the soberness of prophecy.  Key scenes show neighbors turning on him, bribing him in a ""golly, no hard feelings"" sort of way to leave the neighborhood because his presence will bring property values down; his own wife (Estelle Parsons, shrill as she was on ""Roseanne"" but with the same proper effect), who prides herself an enlightened liberal until she actually has to take a personal stand on race, deserting him; and his at first seemingly sympathetic doctor, a highly educated and cultured man who thoughtfully concludes the transformation was not the result of an tanning bed accident, as Gerber outrageously supposes, but from having African ancestry -- and then promptly refers his patient to a black physician.  Any man of color who has found himself the exotic flavor of the month will understand Gerber's reaction when the packed-and-stacked Scandinavian bombshell secretary beds the boss she found completely unattractive when he was a member of her own race.""Watermelon Man"" is not perfect -- at times, the comedy tries too hard, even for the era of postmodern camp  -- but the social satire hits home, then and now.  It's sad, really, that the sentiments at the heart of this film still exist for some people today, after much discussion in the culture, even as it's so obvious how priceless the contributions of African Americans and other people of color have been to the fabric of this great nation.  Populated by a strong cast of character actors, including Howard Caine, SS Major Hochstettler of ""Hogan's Heroes"" fame, it reminds us how race underpins so much of our mean-spirited treatment of one another, and while the film is not hopeless -- most obvious in Gerber's children, about the only people in the movie who seem unfazed by their father's rebirth as a black man -- the revolutionary message at the end is bittersweet, as Gerber finds resigned solace in the one place America allows him even the suggestion of freedom.  The final shot of the film reminds us that our futures are rooted in the present, and our civilization is measured by either the kindness or the coarseness of how we treat each other.  It may seem trite, but that sentiment is as important today as it was over 40 years ago.",5,Hard to Believe This Gem is Not Better Known,1268697600,"03 16, 2010",2010,3910,"['Most', 'well-known', 'social', 'satires', 'dealing', 'white-on-black', 'racism', 'share', 'same', 'strange', 'thing', 'common', ""'re"", 'not', 'written', 'directed', 'African', 'Americans', 'films', 'Blazing', 'Saddles', 'television', 'programs', 'Family', 'are', 'hilarious', 'important', 'own', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'sincere', 'right', 'word', 'film', 'arguably', 'Melvin', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'best.The', 'late', 'great', 'Godfrey', 'Cambridge', 'President', 'Analyst', 'Cotton', 'Comes', 'Harlem', 'Jeff', 'Gerber', 'middle-class', 'American', 'boor', 'who', 'meaningless', 'competition', 'keeping', 'up', 'Joneses', 'chauvinism', 'consequences', 'office', 'short', 'fairly', 'typical', 'suburban', 'guy', 'sexless', 'otherwise', 'happy', 'narcissistic', 'life', 'sort', 'antiseptic', 'order', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'so', 'offensive', 'when', 'Dwight', 'Eisenhower', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'were', 'still', 'more', 'less', 'fresh', 'people', 'minds', 'world', 'changed', 'irrevocably', 'when', 'bigoted', 'unimpeded', 'Gerber', 'one', 'morning', 'find', 'indisputably', 'no', 'longer', 'white', 'privileged', 'black', 'reviled', 'Thus', 'firsthand', 'experiences', 'sort', 'overt', 'covert', 'racism', 'writers', 'Ralph', 'Ellison', 'Chester', 'Himes', 'have', 'described', 'years', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'would', 'lampoon', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'everything', 'co-workers', 'suddenly', 'no', 'longer', 'saying', 'hello', 'bothering', 'make', 'eye', 'contact', 'being', 'accused', 'crimes', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'barred', 'entry', 'private', 'clubs.The', 'best', 'thing', 'Watermelon', 'Man', 'how', 'so', 'much', 'viciousness', 'prejudice', 'rather', 'lectures', 'preaches', 'film', 'out', 'broadly', 'comedic', 'soberness', 'prophecy', 'Key', 'show', 'neighbors', 'turning', 'bribing', 'golly', 'hard', 'feelings', 'sort', 'way', 'leave', 'neighborhood', 'presence', 'will', 'bring', 'property', 'values', 'down', 'own', 'wife', 'Estelle', 'Parsons', 'shrill', 'was', 'Roseanne', 'same', 'proper', 'effect', 'who', 'enlightened', 'liberal', 'actually', 'take', 'personal', 'stand', 'race', 'deserting', 'first', 'seemingly', 'sympathetic', 'doctor', 'highly', 'educated', 'cultured', 'man', 'who', 'thoughtfully', 'transformation', 'was', 'not', 'result', 'tanning', 'bed', 'accident', 'Gerber', 'outrageously', 'having', 'African', 'ancestry', 'then', 'promptly', 'patient', 'black', 'physician', 'man', 'color', 'who', 'found', 'exotic', 'flavor', 'month', 'will', 'understand', 'Gerber', 'reaction', 'when', 'packed-and-stacked', 'Scandinavian', 'bombshell', 'secretary', 'boss', 'found', 'completely', 'unattractive', 'when', 'was', 'member', 'own', 'race', 'Watermelon', 'Man', 'not', 'perfect', 'times', 'comedy', 'tries', 'too', 'hard', 'even', 'era', 'postmodern', 'camp', 'social', 'satire', 'home', 'then', 'now', 'sad', 'really', 'sentiments', 'heart', 'film', 'still', 'exist', 'people', 'today', 'much', 'discussion', 'culture', 'even', 'so', 'obvious', 'how', 'priceless', 'contributions', 'African', 'Americans', 'other', 'people', 'color', 'have', 'been', 'fabric', 'great', 'nation', 'Populated', 'strong', 'cast', 'character', 'actors', 'including', 'Howard', 'Caine', 'SS', 'Major', 'Hochstettler', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'fame', 'how', 'race', 'so', 'much', 'mean-spirited', 'treatment', 'one', 'film', 'not', 'hopeless', 'most', 'obvious', 'Gerber', 'children', 'only', 'people', 'movie', 'who', 'seem', 'unfazed', 'father', 'rebirth', 'black', 'man', 'revolutionary', 'message', 'end', 'bittersweet', 'Gerber', 'finds', 'resigned', 'solace', 'one', 'place', 'America', 'even', 'suggestion', 'freedom', 'final', 'shot', 'film', 'futures', 'are', 'rooted', 'present', 'civilization', 'measured', 'kindness', 'coarseness', 'how', 'treat', 'other', 'may', 'seem', 'trite', 'sentiment', 'important', 'today', 'was', '40', 'years', 'ago']",N/A
