However within minutes of watching I had a feeling my expectations would be let down harshly.Animation's hardly the problem, it all comes back to the script. First, the writers feel the need for the narration to carry on almost constantly, rarely allowing the viewer to simply enjoy the scenery, or to let the story be told through character interaction. Second, there's a focus on rhyming and repetition, which add little to the story but to spell out to the audience what's happening (Thomas repeats, at least FOUR TIMES, a rhyme about how smart and brave he is, right after arranging some ill-conceived plan). There's also little realism - engines cross the ocean on a whim (on one occasion, trailing a steamship *unsecured* on a raft), use *ziplines* to cross gaps, and travel through a tunnel under the ocean with early 1900s technology (a reminder: Thomas' creator Reverend Awdry was a stickler for realistic railway practice, and former showrunners Britt Allcroft and David Mitton tried their best to respect this in the TV adaptation).There's four new characters who contribute next to nothing to the story - Captain the lifeboat has maybe two lines, and the logging engines are repeatedly foolish and rude - which wouldn't be a problem if the story had actually played off those faults. The established characters aren't at their strongest, either. They bluntly explain their emotions, show little common sense, and Thomas is frequently rude, but never called on it. While a secondary character (Whiff) plays a big part for a change, it still feels really rushed and underdeveloped.Overall the movie is poorly-written, difficult to watch, and does little more than show off new toys.

1356125,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B003O85VYU,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[7, 11]","There is a certain magic about the classic Thomas the Tank Engine shows that made it as widely popular as it was. This new rendition doesn't have any of it. This Thomas & Friends release, as well as a number of other recent releases, completely lost the concept that made the originals so great. All you are left with is another derivative and uninspired children's disk you hope will distract the youngsters long enough for you get some work done.So what made the original Thomas great? It's simple really. The show brought the hobbyist model trains to life. Thomas the Tank Engine would showcase what are essentially great big model train sets with all the wondrous detail on landscapes and buildings all done in miniature. This sort of thing spurs the imagination and builds a love of the model train hobby for further generations. It's this simple charm that comes from building a show based on practical effects that you can put together at home that makes the show special.All that is wiped from the table once you start creating the landscapes and characters on computer, which is exactly what this movie is. Thomas and friends are computer generated train engines with moving faces instead of the models with just the eyes moving. The sets, motion scenes, everything is computer generated. What makes this show any different from all of the other CGI animated shows out there? Now you lose what made Thomas great and are playing catch up to shows that have already proven their worth in the computer animated medium. The end results are boring and lackluster when compared.I know I am putting a lot of hate on this show based on it not using traditional models like the original series, but as I said before that's the charm and wonder the original brought forth. Don't take my word for it. My son loves Thomas, but was utterly bored with this movie. I had to flip on NickJr to get his spirits up. If you don't think the absence of real models would make a difference for your kid then at least try it out as a rental before you commit.",2,Don't do it!!

1356127,A2WW57XX2UVLM6,B003O85VYU,Talvi,"[4, 6]","My 3 year old fell in love with Thomas after watching some of the television episodes.  We soon discovered a big difference in the older (filmed model) episodes and the animated episodes:- The engines in the old series are always cranky and participate in mean spirited behavior- The engines in the new series are mostly happy and friendly and make mostly naiive mistakes that they repent and want to fixThe Hero of the Rails feature was really good.  Thomas finds a broken down, hidden Hiro and helps rebuild him.  You instantly like the new characters, Victor and Kevin. Victor is thoughtful and helpful, Kevin has the dropsies but tries really hard.Then there's Misty Island Rescue, which I'd see as the next evolution of Thomas and Friends.  By that I mean it changes / expands the Sodor universe.The animation is great.  The story, however, has so many ""ugh"" moments that I'm left disappointed. Surely the writers could have come up with something better?  My 3 year old loves Misty Island as much as he loves any Thomas, but I am bothered by many things:1) Bash, Dash, and Ferdinand, the new engines (""logging locos""), are annoying and childish. Heck, even Thomas annoyed me.2) They talk about Misty Island as this spooky mystery, yet it's a nearby island (within view but mysteriously shrouded in mist 100% of the time so that nobody remembers seeing it). That is, 100% of the time EXCEPT when Thomas does something pigheaded and the mist disperses, allowing those on Sodor to see his distress signals...3) Hiro says Jobi wood is only found in his homeland (supposedly Japan), yet it's somehow also found a few miles away from Sodor...4) The narration says that Diesel is shunting the Jobi wood flatbeds but mysteriously when he gets to the unfinished bridge, he's suddenly coupled to the flatbeds.5) I always appreciate that in the other Thomas tv and movies, they make an effort to show humans coupling the engines or inside them. They are mysteriously absent on Misty Island. The engines magically have fuel and water etc.6) Thomas is encouraged to cross over the shake shake bridge. I don't want my son watching Thomas crossing a bridge that is falling apart and finding Thomas thinks that's ok.7) The zipline and needless cross-rails are just silly.  They're obviously just there (along with the shake shake bridge) to sell toys.8) The movie should have ended when they all arrived on Sodor, but inexplicably Thomas has to go back through the tunnel to now save his three friends and Topham Hatt who went to Misty Island to rescue Thomas.9) Thomas gets from his adrift raft directly onto rails when landing on Misty Island. Er...10)In the newer Thomas series, when someone says something to goad other engines into doing bad things, they repent and say sorry. In this, Thomas' comments about Topham Hatt surely meaning only steamies could be really useful cause Diesel to do something really stupid.  Thomas never has to apologize but Diesel does.11) Come to think of it, the whole thing starts out badly when Harold brings an injured climber on a stretcher to the rescue center building site saying he's saved.  But it's just a construction site - the center is barely even framed.Sure, this is an animated show, but why such a departure from reality and good sense?  Why leave parents having to explain these strange things?  In a later TV episode, Bash, Dash, and Ferdinand show Thomas how to catch the Jobi wood that Wheezy throws. They go to a certain spot and the thrown logs magically stack on their flatbeds.  Where is the Thomas I like letting my son watch?  If you're going to add new engines, why not make them interesting and meaningful?  It's just so disappointing and didn't have to be.Again, my 3 year old loves it and re-enacts scenes from the movie with his Thomas set. But I would rather play Thomas TV episodes for him and not this silly, ""what on earth were they thinking?"" story.",3,"Looks good but there are so many ""ugh"" moments",1296000000,"01 26, 2011",2011,3912,"['3', 'year', 'old', 'fell', 'love', 'Thomas', 'watching', 'television', 'episodes', 'soon', 'discovered', 'big', 'difference', 'older', 'filmed', 'model', 'episodes', 'animated', 'episodes', 'engines', 'old', 'series', 'are', 'always', 'cranky', 'participate', 'mean', 'spirited', 'behavior-', 'engines', 'new', 'series', 'are', 'mostly', 'happy', 'friendly', 'make', 'mostly', 'naiive', 'mistakes', 'repent', 'want', 'fixThe', 'Hero', 'Rails', 'feature', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'Thomas', 'broken', 'down', 'hidden', 'Hiro', 'rebuild', 'instantly', 'new', 'characters', 'Victor', 'Kevin', 'Victor', 'thoughtful', 'helpful', 'Kevin', 'dropsies', 'tries', 'really', 'hard.Then', 'Misty', 'Island', 'Rescue', ""'d"", 'see', 'next', 'evolution', 'Thomas', 'Friends', 'mean', '/', 'Sodor', 'universe.The', 'animation', 'great', 'story', 'however', 'so', 'many', 'ugh', 'moments', ""'m"", 'left', 'disappointed', 'Surely', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'better', '3', 'year', 'old', 'Misty', 'Island', 'as', 'much', 'Thomas', 'am', 'bothered', 'many', 'things:1', 'Bash', 'Dash', 'Ferdinand', 'new', 'engines', 'logging', 'locos', 'are', 'annoying', 'childish', 'Heck', 'even', 'Thomas', 'annoyed', 'me.2', 'talk', 'Misty', 'Island', 'spooky', 'mystery', 'nearby', 'island', 'view', 'mysteriously', 'shrouded', 'mist', '100', '%', 'time', 'nobody', 'remembers', 'seeing', '100', '%', 'time', 'EXCEPT', 'when', 'Thomas', 'something', 'pigheaded', 'mist', 'disperses', 'allowing', 'Sodor', 'see', 'distress', 'signals', '3', 'Hiro', 'Jobi', 'wood', 'only', 'found', 'homeland', 'supposedly', 'Japan', 'somehow', 'also', 'found', 'few', 'miles', 'away', 'Sodor', '4', 'narration', 'Diesel', 'shunting', 'Jobi', 'wood', 'flatbeds', 'mysteriously', 'when', 'unfinished', 'bridge', 'suddenly', 'coupled', 'flatbeds.5', 'always', 'appreciate', 'other', 'Thomas', 'tv', 'movies', 'make', 'effort', 'show', 'humans', 'coupling', 'engines', 'inside', 'are', 'mysteriously', 'absent', 'Misty', 'Island', 'engines', 'magically', 'have', 'fuel', 'water', 'etc.6', 'Thomas', 'encouraged', 'cross', 'shake', 'shake', 'bridge', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'son', 'watching', 'Thomas', 'crossing', 'bridge', 'falling', 'apart', 'finding', 'Thomas', 'ok.7', 'zipline', 'needless', 'cross-rails', 'are', 'just', 'silly', ""'re"", 'obviously', 'just', 'shake', 'shake', 'bridge', 'sell', 'toys.8', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'when', 'arrived', 'Sodor', 'inexplicably', 'Thomas', 'go', 'back', 'tunnel', 'now', 'save', 'three', 'friends', 'Topham', 'Hatt', 'who', 'went', 'Misty', 'Island', 'rescue', 'Thomas.9', 'Thomas', 'adrift', 'raft', 'directly', 'rails', 'when', 'landing', 'Misty', 'Island', 'Er', '10', 'newer', 'Thomas', 'series', 'when', 'someone', 'something', 'goad', 'other', 'engines', 'doing', 'bad', 'things', 'repent', 'say', 'sorry', 'Thomas', 'comments', 'Topham', 'Hatt', 'surely', 'meaning', 'only', 'steamies', 'could', 'be', 'really', 'useful', 'cause', 'Diesel', 'do', 'something', 'really', 'stupid', 'Thomas', 'never', 'apologize', 'Diesel', 'does.11', 'Come', 'think', 'whole', 'thing', 'out', 'badly', 'when', 'Harold', 'injured', 'climber', 'stretcher', 'rescue', 'center', 'building', 'site', 'saying', 'saved', 'just', 'construction', 'site', 'center', 'barely', 'even', 'framed.Sure', 'animated', 'show', 'why', 'such', 'departure', 'reality', 'good', 'sense', 'Why', 'leave', 'parents', 'having', 'explain', 'strange', 'things', 'later', 'TV', 'episode', 'Bash', 'Dash', 'Ferdinand', 'show', 'Thomas', 'how', 'catch', 'Jobi', 'wood', 'Wheezy', 'go', 'certain', 'spot', 'thrown', 'logs', 'magically', 'stack', 'flatbeds', 'Where', 'Thomas', 'like', 'letting', 'son', 'watch', ""'re"", 'going', 'add', 'new', 'engines', 'why', 'not', 'make', 'interesting', 'meaningful', 'just', 'so', 'disappointing', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'be.Again', '3', 'year', 'old', 're-enacts', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Thomas', 'set', 'would', 'rather', 'play', 'Thomas', 'TV', 'episodes', 'not', 'silly', 'what', 'earth', 'were', 'thinking', 'story']",N/A
