The earlier seasons were clever, intelligent and kept you guessing. This season you could work things out before they happened. I felt the love arc was poorly handled and I don't believe Cuddy would have acted that way. It wasn't like she didn't know what she was getting into. I felt the final episode was a bit silly. House is reckless, but he isn't stupid. Everything he does is a calculated gamble and I don't know if its because the show has new writers or what has changed, but I was left wanting more. Still it is a great show. I think the high standards of the earlier series is what I am after. I will happily watch season eight, but I think they could have done so much more with season seven.

Instead I checked the season out at my local library (aren't libraries great!?!).  Watching through the season I am left both satisfied and disappointed.Several episodes really take off onto the personal relationship tangents and seem to forget about the cases.  In my opinion, this is unacceptable for a show that built it's reputation on quality medical drama with interesting side stories that were just that: side stories.  When the relationship between House and Cuddy takes over an episode so overwhelmingly that you forget what the actual medical case was about...I also have a problem with Cuddy's character becoming kind of weak.  In her relationship with House (especially in the first 8 episodes) we see her sad and confused and generally being played easily by House.  This truly does not fit her strong feminine role, and I for one do not like this portrayal.Later in the season the show definitely picks back up.  The real turning point is episode 9 ""Larger Than Life"".  We really see the case as the focus of the episode.  The side stories with Talb and his wife and House and Cuddy are interesting but don't hog the spotlight.  It also picks up a bit more with the secondary characters getting more screen time.  I also enjoy Chase and Forman and their banter and rivalry.  The addition of a new team member starts as an annoyance, but once she gets comfortable in her role, Amber Tamblyn is good at being the 'annoying smarty pants'.  The other team members seem exasperated with her at times, and it really brings an interesting dynamic.Like previous seasons, most of the cases are based in part on real life cases and events.  The medical mystery aspect is still fun and interesting, and the writers do a good job of portraying the cases without 'dumbing it down' too much.  I found myself googling certain terms on my phone at times (such as checking out when smallpox was eradicated and about the discovery of smallpox scabs in an envelope in a Civil War book that inspired an episode on this season).But overall the episodes are three to five stars.  None of the weaker episodes are as bad as the worst episodes in season 4 (with the American Idol type fellowhip-off).  The weakest episodes in season 7 are just less focused and have muddled roles.  The strong episodes are very strong, and really showcase a nice variety of themes.  The acting is top notch, especially Hugh Laurie, Jessie Spencer, and Robert Sean Leonard.  There are some good guest appearances, and Candice Bergen is fun as Cuddy's mother.All in all a good season, and worthy of watching through at least once.  It's still not up to the level of seasons 1 to 3, and it shows that overly sensational style of any series in it's later seasons (look at later seasons of Friends, Frasier, ER, or pretty much anything that went over 6 seasons and was one of the network's top shows).  But at the core, it still retains the medical mystery drama that we have all come to know and love.  And it stars Hugh Laurie.  And he's awesome.",4,It's a mixed bag season ~,1321488000,"11 17, 2011",2011,3240,"[""'ll"", 'try', 'leave', 'out', 'big', 'spoilers', 'as', 'long', 'have', 'seen', 'season', '6', 'Being', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'House', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'apprehensive', 'purchasing', 'season', 'ups', 'downs', 'season', '4', 'Instead', 'checked', 'season', 'out', 'local', 'library', 'are', ""n't"", 'libraries', 'great', 'Watching', 'season', 'am', 'left', 'satisfied', 'disappointed.Several', 'episodes', 'really', 'take', 'off', 'personal', 'relationship', 'tangents', 'seem', 'forget', 'cases', 'opinion', 'unacceptable', 'show', 'built', 'reputation', 'quality', 'medical', 'drama', 'interesting', 'side', 'stories', 'were', 'just', 'side', 'stories', 'When', 'relationship', 'House', 'Cuddy', 'episode', 'so', 'overwhelmingly', 'forget', 'what', 'actual', 'medical', 'case', 'was', 'also', 'have', 'problem', 'Cuddy', 'character', 'becoming', 'kind', 'weak', 'relationship', 'House', 'especially', 'first', '8', 'episodes', 'see', 'sad', 'confused', 'generally', 'being', 'played', 'easily', 'House', 'truly', 'not', 'fit', 'strong', 'feminine', 'role', 'one', 'do', 'not', 'portrayal.Later', 'season', 'show', 'definitely', 'back', 'up', 'real', 'turning', 'point', 'episode', '9', 'Larger', 'Than', 'Life', 'really', 'see', 'case', 'focus', 'episode', 'side', 'stories', 'Talb', 'wife', 'House', 'Cuddy', 'are', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'hog', 'spotlight', 'also', 'up', 'bit', 'more', 'secondary', 'characters', 'getting', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'also', 'enjoy', 'Chase', 'Forman', 'banter', 'rivalry', 'addition', 'new', 'team', 'member', 'annoyance', 'once', 'comfortable', 'role', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'good', 'being', ""'annoying"", 'smarty', 'pants', 'other', 'team', 'members', 'seem', 'exasperated', 'times', 'really', 'interesting', 'dynamic.Like', 'previous', 'seasons', 'most', 'cases', 'are', 'based', 'part', 'real', 'life', 'cases', 'events', 'medical', 'mystery', 'aspect', 'still', 'fun', 'interesting', 'writers', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'cases', ""'dumbing"", 'down', 'too', 'much', 'found', 'googling', 'certain', 'terms', 'phone', 'times', 'such', 'checking', 'out', 'when', 'smallpox', 'was', 'eradicated', 'discovery', 'smallpox', 'scabs', 'envelope', 'Civil', 'War', 'book', 'inspired', 'episode', 'season', 'overall', 'episodes', 'are', 'three', 'five', 'stars', 'None', 'weaker', 'episodes', 'are', 'as', 'bad', 'worst', 'episodes', 'season', '4', 'American', 'Idol', 'type', 'fellowhip-off', 'weakest', 'episodes', 'season', '7', 'are', 'just', 'less', 'focused', 'have', 'muddled', 'roles', 'strong', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'strong', 'really', 'showcase', 'nice', 'variety', 'themes', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'especially', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'Jessie', 'Spencer', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'are', 'good', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'fun', 'Cuddy', 'mother.All', 'good', 'season', 'worthy', 'watching', 'least', 'once', 'still', 'not', 'level', 'seasons', '1', '3', 'overly', 'sensational', 'style', 'series', 'later', 'seasons', 'look', 'later', 'seasons', 'Friends', 'Frasier', 'ER', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'went', '6', 'seasons', 'was', 'one', 'network', 'top', 'shows', 'core', 'still', 'medical', 'mystery', 'drama', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'love', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'awesome']",N/A

I am not commenting on a non existent box Set. I am here to analyze Season 7 of House as a 'worthy"" product. First, Season 6 was the worst. I hated the entire second half of the season (right after Cameron, who showed great sense, departed). As soon as she left, the producers felt the need to 'change: the tone and look of the show. GONE: the haunting music, melodramatics, and handfuls of Vicodin. IN:Moralizing, A rather forced (it seemed to me) beginning of a relationship between Cuddy (the most boring character on the show next to TAUB)and House. Almost all of the 'cases"" in the second half of season six were completely forgettable.  Season six...ended with the House-Cuddy relationship in a teaser (was it real?).Season 7 only confirmed it was indeed the real deal. And it dragged on and on, week after week. Gone again were any references to HOUSE IN PAIN Wasn't he addicted to vicodin and shooting Morphine because he has a deformed LEG ? They had the audacity to blame his vicodin need on emotional crutches in Season 7.  Let me get this straight---his leg only hurts when he is emotionally insecure? Obviously the writers are pandering to the AMA, the FDA, and the FBI in not showing their best character as a strung out drug addict in need, week after week. It worked well for the first few seasons. Fine, change it up, but dont INSULT the viewers and anyone else in PAIN by dismissing his mangled leg and need for Vicodin as an emotional crutch. It's bad writing and irresponsible. I can't wait for marijuana to become LEGAL in Jersey so House can start toking in the halls of Princeton-Plainsboro. What will Cuddy have to say about THAT (lol).Season 7  is up to episode 18 as I write this as they just aired the return of ""13"" tonight in in episode I was almost bored with. There were some nice moments but the medical case seemed too difficult and then too easy to solve , especially without HOUSE there to 'cure"" or find the right answer. Let's face it, without HOUSE in the mix, as a patient, your chances of Chase, Taub, Cuddy or Foreman finding the real cause of your illness is  near nil. You think after 7 seasons Foreman and Chase would become better diagnosticians.So Season 7..episode for episode--is BETTER than Season 6 as of episode 18. A lot of well written and interesting cases this season. I think even some of the best (but not THE BEST) episodes in two seasons. Nothing will top ""Three Stories""  for pure genius, or ""House's Head"" for bothe emotional and intellectual completeness or  even ""Games"" for its amazing human emotional core appeal. Those are the kinds of episodes that made House a one-off. A unique entity that no other TV series on network dares to go. Most other 'dramatic"" series show characters who just  REACT to situations. We know nothing of them as human beings (every one of those CSI or LAw and Order type shows fit the same mold) HOUSE , the series, and the character is the exception. Even compared to other ""medical"" shows, Hosue is far and above them in terms of human interactions, meaning, philosophy and lessons in life.For that reason I did not buy the entire Cuddy-House fiascao this year because House will always be House. It took most of the season and One great episode (the one where House is Born-Again by jumping into a pool) to prove to both House and the audience..he is who he is. Godo riddence to Cuddy and her set ways. A decent season but still dragged out by a dozen episodes of a relationship that seemed forced from the start. Still the writing improved and the cases were far better than Season six. Olivia Wilde's hiatus and Jennifer Morrison's departure defintely left a void in the sex appeal department (Sorry, Cuddy in her low cut tops doesn't 'cut"" it for me..she's far too annoying as a character. Masters, well, she's almost virginal. A few episodes to go this season. If last season and Season 5 were any indication, you can be sure there will be some major twist or cliff-hanger ending to this season. Many good episodes, I give it 4 stars, but a far cry from the first 5 incredible seasons that made house the best drama EVER on TV and House it's best character.",4,Better than Season 6..but still a far cry from Season 1-5,1302566400,"04 12, 2011",2011,4251,"['Yes', 'would', 'be', 'completely', 'unfair', 'review', 'DVD', 'set', 'one', 'had', 'opportunity', 'buy', 'am', 'not', 'commenting', 'non', 'existent', 'box', 'Set', 'am', 'here', 'analyze', 'Season', '7', 'House', ""'worthy"", 'product', 'First', 'Season', '6', 'was', 'worst', 'hated', 'entire', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'right', 'Cameron', 'who', 'showed', 'great', 'sense', 'departed', 'As', 'soon', 'left', 'producers', 'felt', 'need', ""'change"", 'tone', 'look', 'show', 'GONE', 'haunting', 'music', 'melodramatics', 'handfuls', 'Vicodin', 'IN', 'Moralizing', 'A', 'rather', 'forced', 'seemed', 'beginning', 'relationship', 'Cuddy', 'most', 'boring', 'character', 'show', 'next', 'TAUB', 'House', 'Almost', ""'cases"", 'second', 'half', 'season', 'six', 'were', 'completely', 'forgettable', 'Season', 'six', 'ended', 'House-Cuddy', 'relationship', 'teaser', 'was', 'real', '.Season', '7', 'only', 'confirmed', 'was', 'indeed', 'real', 'deal', 'dragged', 'week', 'week', 'Gone', 'again', 'were', 'references', 'HOUSE', 'IN', 'PAIN', 'Was', ""n't"", 'addicted', 'vicodin', 'shooting', 'Morphine', 'deformed', 'LEG', 'had', 'audacity', 'blame', 'vicodin', 'need', 'emotional', 'crutches', 'Season', '7', 'Let', 'get', 'straight', '-his', 'leg', 'only', 'when', 'emotionally', 'insecure', 'Obviously', 'writers', 'are', 'pandering', 'AMA', 'FDA', 'FBI', 'not', 'showing', 'best', 'character', 'strung', 'out', 'drug', 'addict', 'need', 'week', 'week', 'worked', 'well', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'Fine', 'change', 'up', 'INSULT', 'viewers', 'anyone', 'else', 'PAIN', 'dismissing', 'mangled', 'leg', 'need', 'Vicodin', 'emotional', 'crutch', 'bad', 'writing', 'irresponsible', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'marijuana', 'become', 'LEGAL', 'Jersey', 'so', 'House', 'can', 'start', 'toking', 'halls', 'Princeton-Plainsboro', 'What', 'will', 'Cuddy', 'have', 'say', 'lol', '.Season', '7', 'up', 'episode', '18', 'write', 'just', 'aired', 'return', '13', 'tonight', 'episode', 'was', 'almost', 'bored', 'were', 'nice', 'moments', 'medical', 'case', 'seemed', 'too', 'difficult', 'then', 'too', 'easy', 'solve', 'especially', 'HOUSE', ""'cure"", 'find', 'right', 'answer', 'Let', 'face', 'HOUSE', 'mix', 'patient', 'chances', 'Chase', 'Taub', 'Cuddy', 'Foreman', 'finding', 'real', 'cause', 'illness', 'nil', 'think', '7', 'seasons', 'Foreman', 'Chase', 'would', 'become', 'better', 'diagnosticians.So', 'Season', '7..episode', 'episode', 'BETTER', 'Season', '6', 'episode', '18', 'lot', 'well', 'written', 'interesting', 'cases', 'season', 'think', 'even', 'best', 'not', 'THE', 'BEST', 'two', 'seasons', 'Nothing', 'will', 'top', 'Three', 'Stories', 'pure', 'genius', 'House', 'Head', 'bothe', 'emotional', 'intellectual', 'completeness', 'even', 'Games', 'amazing', 'human', 'emotional', 'core', 'appeal', 'are', 'kinds', 'episodes', 'made', 'House', 'one-off', 'unique', 'entity', 'other', 'TV', 'series', 'network', 'dares', 'go', 'Most', 'other', ""'dramatic"", 'series', 'show', 'characters', 'who', 'just', 'REACT', 'situations', 'know', 'nothing', 'human', 'beings', 'one', 'CSI', 'LAw', 'Order', 'type', 'fit', 'same', 'mold', 'HOUSE', 'series', 'character', 'exception', 'Even', 'compared', 'other', 'medical', 'shows', 'Hosue', 'far', 'above', 'terms', 'human', 'interactions', 'meaning', 'philosophy', 'lessons', 'life.For', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'buy', 'entire', 'Cuddy-House', 'fiascao', 'year', 'House', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'House', 'took', 'most', 'season', 'One', 'great', 'episode', 'one', 'where', 'House', 'Born-Again', 'jumping', 'pool', 'prove', 'House', 'audience..he', 'who', 'Godo', 'riddence', 'Cuddy', 'set', 'ways', 'decent', 'season', 'still', 'dragged', 'out', 'dozen', 'episodes', 'relationship', 'seemed', 'forced', 'start', 'Still', 'writing', 'improved', 'cases', 'were', 'far', 'better', 'Season', 'six', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'hiatus', 'Jennifer', 'Morrison', 'departure', 'defintely', 'left', 'void', 'sex', 'appeal', 'department', 'Sorry', 'Cuddy', 'low', 'cut', 'tops', ""n't"", ""'cut"", 'me..she', 'far', 'too', 'annoying', 'character', 'Masters', 'well', 'almost', 'virginal', 'few', 'episodes', 'go', 'season', 'last', 'season', 'Season', '5', 'were', 'indication', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'major', 'twist', 'cliff-hanger', 'ending', 'season', 'Many', 'good', 'episodes', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'far', 'cry', 'first', '5', 'incredible', 'seasons', 'made', 'house', 'best', 'drama', 'EVER', 'TV', 'House', 'best', 'character']",N/A

Guentert ""Christian Independent""","[1, 1]","I bought this season hoping that the writing may get overhauled after a disappointing Season 6, but it was only slightly better than Season 6 with some episodes boring or almost unwatchable.  This is disappointing since I was a real fan of Seasons 1-5, thinking that House was a heroic character seaching for truth and willing to take risks, not just for his own curiosity, but to save other peoples lives.Season 6 transforms the show into a soap opera with high budget fantasy scenes, dredging up everyone's personal life, and demoting the patients to sort of a Perry Mason style ending of magically finding a correct diagnosis at the end of the show after almost killing the patient with tests or several wrong diagnosis instead a more step by step educational process of diagnosis.  House becomes a self-centered, drug addicted, outlaw losing any sympathetic or redeeming qualities he seemed to have initially.Having been through severe pain only helped with morphine and only given before several surgeries in a week, and knowing that the only bright side was believing it would end some day, maybe it was therapuetic to see a doctor feel some pain that they usually fail to comprehend, otherwise.  Maybe it also was interesting to see someone get enough pain relief to function even though I haven't seen anyone moaning 24 hours a day like I had to until I passed out/slept, and lost 40 pounds that week. I had heard from pain doctors that narcotics to treat actual pain is not addictive, so it does bother me that House is able to abuse the great priviledge of getting needed pain medication and turn it into recreational use.The show has morphed into something not even resembling the believable plot that gained it success.  If they lost writers from Seasons 1-5, they need them back, because the show's creator doesn't seem to have a clue what made the show great.  I think most people still watching after season 5 are just hoping for a few more great episodes or even an accidentally good one, but it looks like that is a delusion based on the end of Season 7.Better of reading a good book like ""Destiny Betrayed"" (second edition).",2,House Disappointed Me After Season 5,1351814400,"11 2, 2012",2012,2142,"['bought', 'season', 'hoping', 'writing', 'may', 'get', 'overhauled', 'disappointing', 'Season', '6', 'was', 'only', 'slightly', 'better', 'Season', '6', 'episodes', 'boring', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'disappointing', 'was', 'real', 'fan', 'Seasons', '1-5', 'thinking', 'House', 'was', 'heroic', 'character', 'seaching', 'truth', 'willing', 'take', 'risks', 'not', 'just', 'own', 'curiosity', 'save', 'other', 'peoples', 'lives.Season', '6', 'transforms', 'show', 'soap', 'opera', 'high', 'budget', 'fantasy', 'scenes', 'dredging', 'up', 'everyone', 'personal', 'life', 'demoting', 'patients', 'sort', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'style', 'ending', 'magically', 'finding', 'correct', 'diagnosis', 'end', 'show', 'almost', 'killing', 'patient', 'tests', 'several', 'wrong', 'diagnosis', 'instead', 'more', 'step', 'step', 'educational', 'process', 'diagnosis', 'House', 'self-centered', 'drug', 'addicted', 'outlaw', 'losing', 'sympathetic', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'seemed', 'have', 'initially.Having', 'been', 'severe', 'pain', 'only', 'helped', 'morphine', 'only', 'given', 'several', 'surgeries', 'week', 'knowing', 'only', 'bright', 'side', 'was', 'believing', 'would', 'end', 'day', 'maybe', 'was', 'therapuetic', 'see', 'doctor', 'feel', 'pain', 'usually', 'fail', 'comprehend', 'otherwise', 'Maybe', 'also', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'someone', 'get', 'enough', 'pain', 'relief', 'function', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anyone', 'moaning', '24', 'hours', 'day', 'had', 'passed', 'out/slept', 'lost', '40', 'pounds', 'week', 'had', 'heard', 'pain', 'doctors', 'narcotics', 'treat', 'actual', 'pain', 'not', 'addictive', 'bother', 'House', 'able', 'abuse', 'great', 'priviledge', 'getting', 'needed', 'pain', 'medication', 'turn', 'recreational', 'use.The', 'show', 'morphed', 'something', 'not', 'even', 'resembling', 'believable', 'plot', 'gained', 'success', 'lost', 'writers', 'Seasons', '1-5', 'need', 'back', 'show', 'creator', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'clue', 'made', 'show', 'great', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'still', 'watching', 'season', '5', 'are', 'just', 'hoping', 'few', 'more', 'great', 'episodes', 'even', 'accidentally', 'good', 'one', 'delusion', 'based', 'end', 'Season', '7.Better', 'reading', 'good', 'book', 'Destiny', 'Betrayed', 'second', 'edition']",N/A

But I somehow think it should have ended around Season 5 or 6. It just seemed like they were taking things a bit too far. At least I THOUGHT they were, until I saw the final episode of this season. Then I KNEW they were. HOUSE has gone from a groundbreaking medical drama to an evening soap opera! I have no idea how there can even be a Season 8 after how 7 ended. I guess Season 8 is actually about over by now. I've never actually gotten to watch them on TV; I just buy the DVDs. I am actually looking forward to it, because I HAVE TO KNOW how it all ends! Despite the dip in quality, it is still pretty good.In my own personal opinion, I think House and Cuddy should have hooked up much earlier, like in Season 5. It's not like we didn't know they had a thing for each other. All the waiting was just silly. The series could have ended while it was ahead. It's not like we viewers would have had this delusional idea that they would have lived happily ever after! We knew they both had issues, especially House, and would have to work on their relationship. (Like most normal couples.) But at least we would have had a decent ending. Instead, we get total tragedy!*SPOILER ALERT*I always liked House (the person). He's not someone I think I could tolerate as a personal friend, but he's an enjoyable character to watch. He's a jerk, yes, but I always thought of him as the one who will say what everyone is thinking, but is afraid to say out loud. The honest one, if you will. He's the one who isn't afraid to get judged. But... this season he went WAY TOO FAR. This show had always been revolutionary, I think. The medical mysteries, solved by House's brilliant mind. Now, it's almost a completely different show. House was already ""damaged,"" as everyone calls him. I really don't need to see him deteriorate even further to be entertained. Everyone deserves something good to happen to them once in a while. Having Cuddy break things off with him for one little slip-up with Vicodin was just ridiculous.

His pranks with Wilson were always funny, but not this.The finale was beyond shocking. It made for great TV, but... we've gotten to love these characters! House could have killed somebody!

Incidentally, how come the police didn't manage to arrive before he hobbled away on his cane? I'll be waiting for Season 8 now. I can't wait to see how they keep it all going.

Many have complained about the writer's not doing justice to the relationship. And that is where I strongly disagree. The writers have created a character from season 1 who has been damaged beyond repair. Every relationship with any woman, whether it be Stacy, or even Cameron, has failed. I don't think it could have been more in character the way everything played out this year. Who really expected the relationship between House and Cuddy to be all kisses and hugs? Knowing what you do about the character, you know that this is incredible growth: the act of trying to be with her. But, there is only so much our damaged doc can offer. Whether or not that is enough is something I'll let you watch and see.(up above is spoiler free, down below is the review for those who have seen the season. If you haven't I suggest reading the above paragraph and stopping)Let's get into the fabric of this season. It is all about change, all about House trying to be happy. In the first episode ""what now"" he tells Cuddy they shouldn't be together because he'll eventually do something to make her leave him. In different words it's what he says to Stacy before breaking it off with her in season 2. He knows he is damaged. He knows that anyone who gets close to him will eventually leave. Cuddy becomes an exception to this rule... for 15 episodes, and then like everyone else leaves him.I blame Cuddy for what ultimately ends the season. She kept pushing House to let out his feelings, even after (in many ways) she tore out what was left of his heart. No one can say that House wasn't trying in the relationship. He was trying a lot harder than Cuddy. The fact that she ended it over one slip up shows that she never really wanted it to begin with. She took advantage of him in his most vulnerable state, and went for something she didn't fully want. I feel she was lucky that she only lost part of her house because of it. A lot worse could have happened. House was not House driving that car up her yard and through her dining room. That House was years of anger manifesting, possessing him to do something he never would have done otherwise.As a huge fan of the show, I feel a need to defend the negative reviews. If you are a casual viewer, go back to the beginning and start this incredible story from the pilot on. Let me talk about the negative reviews. Critics and fans alike attack the ending of the season, saying ""House could have killed Rachel. He didn't know where she was, and for that reason I find the character now unwatchable,"" or ""House has jumped many sharks, but this is the biggest"" which by the way is the most overused term in the world. It's an argument with some weight to it. But, I have a better one. As I said above, in that moment it was the anger manifesting. That wasn't the House of season 1 or even earlier season 7. That was a House trying to pick up the pieces of what was left of his life, only to have them knocked out of his hands over and over again. In many ways I think that's the point of the ending of the season. He has gone too far. He has cut ties with everyone close. If he returns, won't he do time in jail? Won't he lose his medical license?To answer those questions, I'll say this. I have absolute faith in these writers to take us to the next point in House's journey. It will be realistic, in character, and must watch tv. According to Hugh Laurie, season 8 is probably the final season. Why would you jump ship now? See it to the end. Maybe you'll appreciate the show for what it's always been: nothing short of amazing.",5,I'm here to defend a continuously amazing show...,1308960000,"06 25, 2011",2011,3659,"['relationship', 'House', 'Cuddy', 'been', 'coming', 'season', 'seven', 'here', 'Many', 'have', 'complained', 'writer', 'not', 'doing', 'justice', 'relationship', 'where', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'writers', 'have', 'created', 'character', 'season', '1', 'who', 'been', 'damaged', 'repair', 'relationship', 'woman', 'be', 'Stacy', 'even', 'Cameron', 'failed', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'character', 'way', 'everything', 'played', 'out', 'year', 'Who', 'really', 'expected', 'relationship', 'House', 'Cuddy', 'be', 'kisses', 'hugs', 'Knowing', 'what', 'do', 'character', 'know', 'incredible', 'growth', 'act', 'trying', 'be', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'damaged', 'doc', 'can', 'offer', 'Whether', 'not', 'enough', 'something', ""'ll"", 'let', 'watch', 'see', 'above', 'spoiler', 'free', 'down', 'below', 'review', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'season', 'have', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'reading', 'above', 'paragraph', 'stopping', 'Let', 'get', 'fabric', 'season', 'change', 'House', 'trying', 'be', 'happy', 'first', 'episode', 'what', 'now', 'Cuddy', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'together', ""'ll"", 'eventually', 'do', 'something', 'make', 'leave', 'different', 'words', 'what', 'Stacy', 'breaking', 'off', 'season', '2', 'damaged', 'anyone', 'who', 'close', 'will', 'eventually', 'leave', 'Cuddy', 'exception', 'rule', '15', 'episodes', 'then', 'everyone', 'else', 'him.I', 'blame', 'Cuddy', 'what', 'ultimately', 'season', 'kept', 'pushing', 'House', 'let', 'out', 'feelings', 'even', 'many', 'ways', 'tore', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'left', 'heart', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'House', 'was', ""n't"", 'trying', 'relationship', 'was', 'trying', 'lot', 'harder', 'Cuddy', 'fact', 'ended', 'over', 'one', 'slip', 'up', 'never', 'really', 'wanted', 'begin', 'took', 'advantage', 'most', 'vulnerable', 'state', 'went', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'fully', 'want', 'feel', 'was', 'lucky', 'only', 'lost', 'part', 'house', 'lot', 'worse', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'House', 'was', 'not', 'House', 'driving', 'car', 'up', 'yard', 'dining', 'room', 'House', 'was', 'years', 'anger', 'manifesting', 'possessing', 'do', 'something', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'otherwise.As', 'huge', 'fan', 'show', 'feel', 'need', 'defend', 'negative', 'reviews', 'are', 'casual', 'viewer', 'go', 'back', 'beginning', 'start', 'incredible', 'story', 'pilot', 'Let', 'talk', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Critics', 'fans', 'alike', 'attack', 'ending', 'season', 'saying', 'House', 'could', 'have', 'killed', 'Rachel', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'was', 'reason', 'find', 'character', 'now', 'unwatchable', 'House', 'jumped', 'many', 'sharks', 'biggest', 'way', 'most', 'overused', 'term', 'world', 'argument', 'weight', 'have', 'better', 'one', 'said', 'above', 'moment', 'was', 'anger', 'manifesting', 'was', ""n't"", 'House', 'season', '1', 'even', 'earlier', 'season', '7', 'was', 'House', 'trying', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'what', 'was', 'left', 'life', 'only', 'have', 'knocked', 'hands', 'over', 'again', 'many', 'ways', 'think', 'point', 'ending', 'season', 'gone', 'too', 'far', 'cut', 'ties', 'everyone', 'close', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'time', 'jail', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'lose', 'medical', 'license', 'answer', 'questions', ""'ll"", 'say', 'have', 'absolute', 'faith', 'writers', 'take', 'next', 'point', 'House', 'journey', 'will', 'be', 'realistic', 'character', 'must', 'watch', 'tv', 'According', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'season', '8', 'probably', 'final', 'season', 'Why', 'would', 'jump', 'ship', 'now', 'See', 'end', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'show', 'what', 'always', 'been', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing']",N/A

1359898,A2VODABWSVHV8E,B003R0MF3A,"Ray ""A Reader""","[0, 1]","House M.D. has now gone through seven seasons. Each season has consisted of approximately 24 episodes (with the exception of Season Four, when the writer's strike of 2006 brought the show, along with most every other show, to a complete stop, and resulted in a truncated season). This means that House M.D. has moved significantly beyond the 100-show mark, that perilous and generally inflexible salient of a show's quality. We saw this as far back in the early 1960's with The Dick Van Dyke Show, when, at the height of its acclaim and popularity, Carl Reiner ended it so that the show could always be remembered as one that went on a high. We have, arguably, also witnesses multiple cases since that time when other shows, remaining huge money makers pass the 100-show threshold, because of fiduciary interests continued to move on, resulting in episodes that were increasingly awful to watch. (I will spare the listing. But by the way, one of the few shows to have overcome that ""rule"" is the acclaimed BBC show MI-5, which is now filming it's 10th, and final Season, perhaps giving nod to this unwritten truth surrounding television shows.)House M.D. could have easily gone down this same route, extinguishing its quality as it progressed. But after going through the complete Seventh Season, I can happily report that, in my opinion, House M.D. has not yet suffered that fate. In spite of some unusual twists in story line and a number of unexpected diversions in the show (which I will not point out to help eliminate spoilers), the show fundamentally remains the fascinating story of a genius medical doctor who struggles with a terrible physical condition which seems to defy physical and psychological treatment. The writers and producers of the show have managed to keep the show refreshingly interesting and engrossing, and although the writers seem to manage to paint themselves into a corner at the end of each season, the next sees the story grow and change. Season Seven is no different.Some House M.D. fans have written that they do not like of the story line changes of the past couple of years, some going as far to say that the show should have been ended at the completion of Season Six. I can see easily their point, and the argument has merit. On the other hand, there can be little denying that Season Seven has given everyone in the House M.D. family a chance to soar and to open their characters in a way we did not see in the earlier seasons. Much more physical comedy and biting sarcasm, for example, seems to be the rule in Season Seven. Strange settings and events, no stranger to House M.D., arise aplenty, and there is seemingly no end to the dramatic and sometimes ingenious devices used to brings the main characters into conflict, support, new paths, and old alliances.All of this makes Season Seven incredibly interesting, fun, and dramatic. If you have not seen House M.D., this is not a good Season in which to enter, because it is largely built off the understanding of the previous six seasons. (I would rather recommend for you that you go back to Season One, and start there. Then the rest will be much more enjoyable and powerful to you.) But for those who have watched House perform his skills over the past six years, I can't really do anything but recommend Season Seven. And perhaps, more than any Season, when you watch this, sit back and enjoy the more pronounced (and relaxed) dramatic, comedic, and musical skills of the group. They are allowed to sail here more than in any other Season. It's really quite a story to watch.House M.D. I'll miss it when it's over. It can't go on forever, and there is talk that the upcoming Season Eight may be its last. But its been one of the most unusual and entertaining shows I've ever seen. I don't agree with all of it, and can't go along with House himself in some of his beliefs and actions, but its one of those stories that has been cast with an actor--Hugh Laurie--who could pull it off with aplomb. Wow. Even with its shortcomings and twists that not everyone agrees were good ideas, this has been an amazing show.Other LinksThe BBC's MI-5, Volume 1The Dick Van Dyke Show - The Complete SeriesHouse, M.D.: Season One",5,House M.D. Manages Yet Again Another Unique Season,1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,4212,"['House', 'M.D', 'now', 'gone', 'seven', 'seasons', 'season', 'consisted', 'approximately', '24', 'episodes', 'exception', 'Season', 'Four', 'when', 'writer', 'strike', '2006', 'brought', 'show', 'most', 'other', 'show', 'complete', 'stop', 'resulted', 'truncated', 'season', 'House', 'M.D', 'moved', 'significantly', '100-show', 'mark', 'perilous', 'generally', 'inflexible', 'salient', 'show', 'quality', 'saw', 'far', 'back', 'early', '1960', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Show', 'when', 'height', 'acclaim', 'popularity', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'ended', 'so', 'show', 'could', 'always', 'be', 'remembered', 'one', 'went', 'high', 'have', 'arguably', 'also', 'multiple', 'cases', 'time', 'when', 'other', 'shows', 'remaining', 'huge', 'money', 'makers', 'pass', '100-show', 'threshold', 'fiduciary', 'interests', 'continued', 'move', 'resulting', 'episodes', 'were', 'increasingly', 'awful', 'watch', 'will', 'spare', 'listing', 'way', 'one', 'few', 'shows', 'have', 'overcome', 'rule', 'acclaimed', 'BBC', 'show', 'MI-5', 'now', 'filming', '10th', 'final', 'Season', 'perhaps', 'giving', 'nod', 'unwritten', 'truth', 'surrounding', 'television', 'shows', 'House', 'M.D', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'gone', 'down', 'same', 'route', 'extinguishing', 'quality', 'progressed', 'going', 'complete', 'Seventh', 'Season', 'can', 'happily', 'report', 'opinion', 'House', 'M.D', 'not', 'yet', 'suffered', 'fate', 'spite', 'unusual', 'twists', 'story', 'line', 'number', 'unexpected', 'diversions', 'show', 'will', 'not', 'point', 'out', 'help', 'eliminate', 'spoilers', 'show', 'fundamentally', 'fascinating', 'story', 'genius', 'medical', 'doctor', 'who', 'terrible', 'physical', 'condition', 'defy', 'physical', 'psychological', 'treatment', 'writers', 'producers', 'show', 'have', 'managed', 'keep', 'show', 'refreshingly', 'interesting', 'engrossing', 'writers', 'seem', 'manage', 'paint', 'corner', 'end', 'season', 'next', 'story', 'grow', 'change', 'Season', 'Seven', 'different.Some', 'House', 'M.D', 'fans', 'have', 'written', 'do', 'not', 'story', 'line', 'changes', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'going', 'far', 'say', 'show', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'ended', 'completion', 'Season', 'Six', 'can', 'see', 'easily', 'point', 'argument', 'merit', 'other', 'hand', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'denying', 'Season', 'Seven', 'given', 'everyone', 'House', 'M.D', 'family', 'chance', 'soar', 'open', 'characters', 'way', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Much', 'more', 'physical', 'comedy', 'biting', 'sarcasm', 'example', 'be', 'rule', 'Season', 'Seven', 'Strange', 'settings', 'events', 'stranger', 'House', 'M.D.', 'arise', 'aplenty', 'seemingly', 'end', 'dramatic', 'sometimes', 'ingenious', 'devices', 'used', 'brings', 'main', 'characters', 'conflict', 'support', 'new', 'paths', 'old', 'alliances.All', 'Season', 'Seven', 'incredibly', 'interesting', 'fun', 'dramatic', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'House', 'M.D.', 'not', 'good', 'Season', 'enter', 'largely', 'built', 'off', 'understanding', 'previous', 'six', 'seasons', 'would', 'rather', 'recommend', 'go', 'back', 'Season', 'One', 'start', 'there', 'Then', 'rest', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'powerful', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'House', 'perform', 'skills', 'past', 'six', 'years', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'recommend', 'Season', 'Seven', 'perhaps', 'more', 'Season', 'when', 'watch', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'more', 'pronounced', 'relaxed', 'dramatic', 'comedic', 'musical', 'skills', 'group', 'are', 'allowed', 'sail', 'here', 'more', 'other', 'Season', 'really', 'quite', 'story', 'watch.House', 'M.D', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'when', 'over', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'forever', 'talk', 'upcoming', 'Season', 'Eight', 'may', 'be', 'last', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'unusual', 'entertaining', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'along', 'House', 'beliefs', 'actions', 'one', 'stories', 'been', 'cast', 'actor', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'who', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'aplomb', 'Wow', 'Even', 'shortcomings', 'twists', 'not', 'everyone', 'agrees', 'were', 'good', 'ideas', 'been', 'amazing', 'show.Other', 'LinksThe', 'BBC', 'MI-5', 'Volume', '1The', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Show', 'Complete', 'SeriesHouse', 'M.D', 'Season', 'One']",N/A

1359909,A2ZHSORK1HHYTT,B003R0MF3A,Willy D. Reviewer,"[2, 4]","It seems all series in their final two seasons take a drop in storyline & writing skills.  House M.D. is no exception.Loyal followers of this series have come to love Gregory House's roller coaster character.  The one constant has always been that he is an egotistical jerk, but absolutely brilliant at last minute diagnosis.  We forgave him being a jerk as long as he saved the patient.  Also in previous seasons he was an opiate addict, which added dimension to his character (in a very negative way).Finally he ""kicks the habit"" -- until this last season.  What the writers failed to understand is that viewers don't mind their heroes having serious character flaws, as long as there is the possibility that this can be overcome -- it's called character arc in the business.  For House to slip back into addiction is lazy, bankrupt writing, which therefore makes all of the plots, and sub-plots depressing and ""we've seen this before"".  All of the other major characters don't fair well either -- they are charactatures of previous episodes and bring absolutely nothing new to this seasons plots.  They are redundant.Viewers wanted to see House's brilliance in solving impossible medical cases -- that's what makes this semi-medical series fun -- not him continually gulping down a hand full of Vicodin every ten minutes and making stupid decisions (personally and professionally).  We wanted to see House conquer Mr. Everest and be at the top of his game -- we wanted to see a guy we could like.  The writers didn't understand this.The viewer finally concludes at the end of this boring season that House does not deserve to be called a medical doctor, nor should he ever be allowed near a patient even as a candy striper.  He is not a friend to anyone, least of all himself, or the viewer.If you have to see this last season -- which you no doubt do -- then rent it, because you will only watch it once.",2,Very Poor Season Seven,1317772800,"10 5, 2011",2011,1908,"['series', 'final', 'two', 'seasons', 'take', 'drop', 'storyline', 'writing', 'skills', 'House', 'M.D', 'exception.Loyal', 'followers', 'series', 'have', 'come', 'love', 'Gregory', 'House', 'roller', 'coaster', 'character', 'one', 'constant', 'always', 'been', 'egotistical', 'jerk', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'last', 'minute', 'diagnosis', 'forgave', 'being', 'jerk', 'as', 'long', 'saved', 'patient', 'Also', 'previous', 'seasons', 'was', 'opiate', 'addict', 'added', 'dimension', 'character', 'very', 'negative', 'way', '.Finally', 'habit', 'last', 'season', 'What', 'writers', 'failed', 'understand', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'heroes', 'having', 'serious', 'character', 'flaws', 'as', 'long', 'possibility', 'can', 'be', 'overcome', 'called', 'character', 'arc', 'business', 'House', 'slip', 'back', 'addiction', 'lazy', 'bankrupt', 'writing', 'therefore', 'plots', 'sub-plots', 'depressing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'major', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'fair', 'well', 'are', 'charactatures', 'previous', 'episodes', 'bring', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'new', 'seasons', 'plots', 'are', 'redundant.Viewers', 'wanted', 'see', 'House', 'brilliance', 'solving', 'impossible', 'medical', 'cases', 'what', 'semi-medical', 'series', 'fun', 'not', 'continually', 'gulping', 'down', 'hand', 'full', 'Vicodin', 'ten', 'minutes', 'making', 'stupid', 'decisions', 'personally', 'professionally', 'wanted', 'see', 'House', 'conquer', 'Mr.', 'Everest', 'be', 'top', 'game', 'wanted', 'see', 'guy', 'could', 'like', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'this.The', 'viewer', 'finally', 'end', 'boring', 'season', 'House', 'not', 'deserve', 'be', 'called', 'medical', 'doctor', 'should', 'ever', 'be', 'allowed', 'patient', 'even', 'candy', 'striper', 'not', 'friend', 'anyone', 'least', 'viewer.If', 'have', 'see', 'last', 'season', 'doubt', 'do', 'then', 'rent', 'will', 'only', 'watch', 'once']",N/A
