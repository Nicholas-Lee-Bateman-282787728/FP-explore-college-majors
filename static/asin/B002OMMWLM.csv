At RiffTrax, Mike has only grown more smug and bully-like - his stint as MST3K host was marked by a &#34;I'm better than these people on the screen&#34; attitude.  And Kevin Murphy is right there with him.  The Cinematic Titanic team is made up of the cream of the crop :  Joel, J. Elvis, TVs Frank, Trace and Mary Jo (though perhaps mild coaching of Mary Jo's delivery is in order - things seem to stop a tad when she talks.).  Joel and the invention exchange, Joel and his gadgets, Joel and his interplay with the screen itself;  that sense of fun is in evidence here, and i love it.  You know, it's somewhat easy to sit back and ridicule someone else's work (though admittedly not easy to do it as wittily as these guys do) - so the idea of screening a film that was made under extreme conditions or limited resources and then throwing stones at it is comedy that resides on a slippery slope marked by cruelty and condescension.  It takes finesse, class and wit to avoid the easy, ugly route - and these five have it in spades.  It's the art of poking fun at it's finest.  (You often get the idea that even the filmmakers would laugh as they watched an episode of Cinematic Titanic).  Of course, on the other hand, some of the filmmakers NEED to have stones thrown at them for making some of the awful messes that get the riff treatment but... Oh well - I'm a Cinematic Titanic fan and this disc is great .  (But get some bar stools for the guys who have to stand the whole time.)",5,Enjoyed this immensely,1367280000,"04 30, 2013",2013,1562,"['Joel', 'always', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'playful', 'warmer', 'kinder', 'way', 'Mike', 'RiffTrax', 'Mike', 'only', 'grown', 'more', 'smug', 'bully-like', 'stint', 'MST3K', 'host', 'was', 'marked', '34', ""'m"", 'better', 'people', 'screen', '34', 'attitude', 'Kevin', 'Murphy', 'right', 'there', 'Cinematic', 'Titanic', 'team', 'made', 'cream', 'crop', 'Joel', 'J.', 'Elvis', 'TVs', 'Frank', 'Trace', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'perhaps', 'mild', 'coaching', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'delivery', 'order', 'things', 'seem', 'stop', 'tad', 'when', 'talks.', 'Joel', 'invention', 'exchange', 'Joel', 'gadgets', 'Joel', 'interplay', 'screen', 'sense', 'fun', 'evidence', 'here', 'i', 'love', 'know', 'somewhat', 'easy', 'sit', 'back', 'ridicule', 'someone', 'else', 'work', 'admittedly', 'not', 'easy', 'do', 'as', 'wittily', 'guys', 'do', 'idea', 'screening', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'extreme', 'conditions', 'limited', 'resources', 'then', 'throwing', 'stones', 'comedy', 'slippery', 'slope', 'marked', 'cruelty', 'condescension', 'finesse', 'class', 'wit', 'avoid', 'easy', 'ugly', 'route', 'five', 'have', 'spades', 'art', 'poking', 'fun', 'finest', 'often', 'get', 'idea', 'even', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'laugh', 'watched', 'episode', 'Cinematic', 'Titanic', 'course', 'other', 'hand', 'filmmakers', 'NEED', 'have', 'stones', 'thrown', 'making', 'awful', 'messes', 'get', 'riff', 'treatment', 'Oh', 'well', ""'m"", 'Cinematic', 'Titanic', 'fan', 'disc', 'great', 'get', 'bar', 'stools', 'guys', 'who', 'have', 'stand', 'whole', 'time']",N/A
