1249059,AVI9DU2RCLLB8,B0023S4A5S,"F. Caldwell ""mixedpaint""","[4, 4]","Kyo Kara Maoh is the story of Yuri Shibuya (or Shibuya Yuri if you're watching in Japanese) a 15 year old high school student who gets sucked into an alternate world. And yes, he gets there through a toilet the first time. But stay with me here. Yuri awakens in a medieval type village and is informed shortly thereafter that he is the new Demon King (the Maoh of the title). It seems that Yuri, with his black hair and black eyes, is an extremely rare type in this world. He also has incredible magical abilities that he never knew about. Included in the story are conflicts between the humans and demons, unusual creatures (flying skeletons anyone?), swordfighting, a reluctant king, and a healthy dose of humor. Actually some of the side stories are downright silly. But despite it all Kyo Kara Maoh is a really great show.Season one starts off well and treads water for a while in the middle but it ends on a high note. A few filler episodes are to be expected when one season has 39 episodes so it's forgiveable. Filler aside, it's really grown on me. The main plot that's begun in season 1 carries over through all of season 2. It works out in a very interesting way too despite a slightly slow start. I can't recommend it enough. I'm also biding my time until the Season 2 set is available and holding out hope that Season 3 will be released for the English speakers eventually too.Kyo Kara Maoh has a great cast of characters and has a fun sense of humor. It's also suprisingly little kid friendly. With a bit of editing, even younger kids can enjoy it which is nice. Most anime is really not child friendly so it's always good to find one that is.Now for the details of the set: Season one is 39 episodes which are split into 9 different discs. The discs are packed into slim line cases, two to a case (except for the 9th which is by itself). As with all slim line cases, the discs are liable to pop out of the cases but the packaging is otherwise pretty nice. The cases include the original cover art from the previous set (this is a rerelease) and list the episode names with a few screenshots. All of this fits into a box which is a little on the thin side but keeps them together and neat all the same. And all 9 discs have both Japanese and English audio along with subtitles. They also include a few extras like slide shows and trailers for other shows. So the pricetag might be a little high but you get a lot of show for your money. You hardly even need any extras.Oh and I have to say, the Japanese audio is way better than the English dub for this show. I watched most of season 1 in English the first time around and couldn't stand Wolfram (Yuri's accidental fiance. Yes, a man. In the Great Demon Kingdom they do that). Many of the voices are better in Japanese so I recommend watching it that way. Plus if you're a fan of the Gravitation anime, Gunther shares a voice with Yuki Eiri.",4,An interesting start to a good show,1245888000,"06 25, 2009",2009,2905,"['Kyo', 'Kara', 'Maoh', 'story', 'Yuri', 'Shibuya', 'Shibuya', 'Yuri', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Japanese', '15', 'year', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'sucked', 'alternate', 'world', 'yes', 'there', 'toilet', 'first', 'time', 'stay', 'here', 'Yuri', 'medieval', 'type', 'village', 'informed', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'new', 'Demon', 'King', 'Maoh', 'title', 'Yuri', 'black', 'hair', 'black', 'eyes', 'extremely', 'rare', 'type', 'world', 'also', 'incredible', 'magical', 'abilities', 'never', 'knew', 'Included', 'story', 'are', 'conflicts', 'humans', 'demons', 'unusual', 'creatures', 'flying', 'skeletons', 'anyone', 'swordfighting', 'reluctant', 'king', 'healthy', 'dose', 'humor', 'Actually', 'side', 'stories', 'are', 'downright', 'silly', 'Kyo', 'Kara', 'Maoh', 'really', 'great', 'show.Season', 'one', 'off', 'well', 'treads', 'water', 'while', 'middle', 'high', 'note', 'few', 'filler', 'episodes', 'are', 'be', 'expected', 'when', 'one', 'season', '39', 'episodes', 'forgiveable', 'Filler', 'aside', 'really', 'grown', 'main', 'plot', 'begun', 'season', '1', 'season', '2', 'out', 'very', 'interesting', 'way', 'too', 'slightly', 'slow', 'start', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'enough', ""'m"", 'also', 'biding', 'time', 'Season', '2', 'set', 'available', 'holding', 'out', 'hope', 'Season', '3', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'English', 'speakers', 'eventually', 'too.Kyo', 'Kara', 'Maoh', 'great', 'cast', 'characters', 'fun', 'sense', 'humor', 'also', 'suprisingly', 'little', 'kid', 'friendly', 'bit', 'editing', 'even', 'younger', 'kids', 'can', 'enjoy', 'nice', 'Most', 'anime', 'really', 'not', 'child', 'friendly', 'always', 'good', 'find', 'one', 'details', 'set', 'Season', 'one', '39', 'episodes', 'are', 'split', '9', 'different', 'discs', 'discs', 'are', 'packed', 'slim', 'line', 'cases', 'two', 'case', '9th', 'slim', 'line', 'cases', 'discs', 'are', 'liable', 'pop', 'cases', 'packaging', 'otherwise', 'pretty', 'nice', 'cases', 'include', 'original', 'cover', 'art', 'previous', 'set', 'rerelease', 'episode', 'names', 'few', 'screenshots', 'box', 'little', 'thin', 'side', 'together', 'neat', 'same', '9', 'discs', 'have', 'Japanese', 'English', 'audio', 'subtitles', 'also', 'include', 'few', 'extras', 'slide', 'shows', 'trailers', 'other', 'shows', 'pricetag', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'high', 'get', 'lot', 'show', 'money', 'hardly', 'even', 'need', 'extras.Oh', 'have', 'say', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'way', 'better', 'English', 'dub', 'show', 'watched', 'most', 'season', '1', 'English', 'first', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Wolfram', 'Yuri', 'accidental', 'fiance', 'Yes', 'man', 'Great', 'Demon', 'Kingdom', 'do', 'Many', 'voices', 'are', 'better', 'Japanese', 'recommend', 'watching', 'way', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Gravitation', 'anime', 'Gunther', 'shares', 'voice', 'Yuki', 'Eiri']",N/A
1249060,A182VTJIIEVM37,B0023S4A5S,GintaxAlvissforever,"[1, 1]","Man, when my sister told me about this series, it didn't sound interesting until she told me it's like Fushigi Yugi...only difference is it's an ordinary boy named Yuuri pulled into the Demon World through a toilet after trying to save a student he use to know when he was younger (that ran off on him). In the demon world (which is implied to be Germany given the outfits of all the characters) he is suddenly attacked by people who accuse him of being a demon and almost killed. He is saved by a handsome man named Conrad who snatches him up and takes him back to the Mazoku Kingdom (the demon kingdom) where he explains the situation. Yuuri is apparently the next in line to become the demon king because of a prophecy and because of his appearance of being a double black demon (black eyes and hair is exceptionally rare). Yuuri honestly isn't interested and just wants to go home but as he sees the situation with the human and demons, he is pulled into restoring piece to the other world and preventing a war from breaking out.Unlike Fushigi Yugi, Kyo Kara Maoh is a comedy series and unlike Fushigi Yugi, Kyo Kara Maou (or God Save Our King) is very idealistic. In fact, this series is the most idealistic series I have EVER seen. Despite the series being a comedy, the plot and topics talked about are VERY SERIOUS. In fact, the series evolves into an action series and gets more serious as time goes on (to the point that season 3 is rather dark compared to the other two seasons.) Yuuri's naive nature which would get him killed in any other series, proves to be a good thing as his naive nature is what is needed to prevent war. The themes of this series include, war, death, RACISM (the biggest of the bunch), slavery, segregation AND massacres. You wouldn't believe that by looking at the cute cover.This is only season 1 so I'll only cover the events of this season (the rest can be ranted on the season 2 boxset). The first season is basically Yuuri getting accustomed to the demon world and learning the problems that need to be fixed and trying to fix it. The end of season 1 is them coming back to the demon kingdom beaten and confused (won't explain why because it's a plot twist). Because this season is introducing many characters that would show up a lot during season 2, its mainly just small arcs that last 2-4 episodes with fillers only being one episode.In season 1, I will confess that there is hardly any character development because you are being introduced to everyone. However, Wolfram is the only character that shows signs of any character development and by season 2, he is a different person. As the youngest son of the Von Bielefeld (the previous family in charge of ruling the Mazoku kingdom), he is very stuck up, spoiled and obnoxious. He's not a likable character even if he's a tsundere at the beginning. It only takes one episode for Yuuri to knock some sense into him...and by that I mean accidentally proposing to him via slapping him on the cheek and then dueling him, getting his butt kicked in the process. You could literally save ""Love at first punch"" for these two because after that, Wolfram takes his engagement to Yuuri very seriously. Yes this is played for comedy except for shippers like me but its to be noted that in later series, the relationship is not that much comedy anymore given how Wolfram takes the pride of being Yuuri's fiance to actually falling in love with him. I mean, they get a couple of episodes to developing their love for each other (as much as Yuuri denies being gay and the irony is that in this world, homosexuality isn't a problem. Race is.) But later on after a certain event, Wolfram finally decides to change as a person and this will be covered in the season 2 review.Overall, a great series to start if you're find with the homoerotic subtext in this series (and probably one of the few series that makes it believable without calling this series a yaoi or even shonen ai.) It has comedy, adventure, action (yes it has a lot of fighting in it given how war is such a huge role in the series), a split personality (Yuuri fights with a split personality that emerges when he's angry), cross-dressing and a lot of drama near the end of season 1. It's a very well-balanced package in retrospect~",5,Fushigi Yugi + Gayness = This Series,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,4280,"['Man', 'when', 'sister', 'told', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'interesting', 'told', 'Fushigi', 'Yugi', 'only', 'difference', 'ordinary', 'boy', 'named', 'Yuuri', 'pulled', 'Demon', 'World', 'toilet', 'trying', 'save', 'student', 'know', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'ran', 'off', 'demon', 'world', 'implied', 'be', 'Germany', 'given', 'outfits', 'characters', 'suddenly', 'attacked', 'people', 'who', 'accuse', 'being', 'demon', 'almost', 'killed', 'saved', 'handsome', 'man', 'named', 'Conrad', 'who', 'up', 'back', 'Mazoku', 'Kingdom', 'demon', 'kingdom', 'where', 'situation', 'Yuuri', 'apparently', 'next', 'line', 'become', 'demon', 'king', 'prophecy', 'appearance', 'being', 'double', 'black', 'demon', 'black', 'eyes', 'hair', 'exceptionally', 'rare', 'Yuuri', 'honestly', ""n't"", 'interested', 'just', 'go', 'home', 'situation', 'human', 'demons', 'pulled', 'restoring', 'piece', 'other', 'world', 'preventing', 'war', 'breaking', 'Fushigi', 'Yugi', 'Kyo', 'Kara', 'Maoh', 'comedy', 'series', 'Fushigi', 'Yugi', 'Kyo', 'Kara', 'Maou', 'God', 'Save', 'King', 'very', 'idealistic', 'fact', 'series', 'most', 'idealistic', 'series', 'have', 'EVER', 'seen', 'series', 'being', 'comedy', 'plot', 'topics', 'talked', 'are', 'VERY', 'SERIOUS', 'fact', 'series', 'action', 'series', 'more', 'serious', 'time', 'point', 'season', '3', 'rather', 'dark', 'compared', 'other', 'two', 'seasons', 'Yuuri', 'naive', 'nature', 'would', 'get', 'killed', 'other', 'series', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'naive', 'nature', 'what', 'needed', 'prevent', 'war', 'themes', 'series', 'include', 'war', 'death', 'RACISM', 'biggest', 'bunch', 'slavery', 'segregation', 'AND', 'would', ""n't"", 'believe', 'looking', 'cute', 'cover.This', 'only', 'season', '1', 'so', ""'ll"", 'only', 'cover', 'events', 'season', 'rest', 'can', 'be', 'ranted', 'season', '2', 'boxset', 'first', 'season', 'basically', 'Yuuri', 'getting', 'accustomed', 'demon', 'world', 'learning', 'problems', 'need', 'be', 'fixed', 'trying', 'fix', 'end', 'season', '1', 'coming', 'back', 'demon', 'kingdom', 'beaten', 'confused', 'wo', ""n't"", 'explain', 'why', 'plot', 'twist', 'season', 'introducing', 'many', 'characters', 'would', 'show', 'up', 'lot', 'season', '2', 'mainly', 'just', 'small', 'arcs', 'last', '2-4', 'episodes', 'fillers', 'only', 'being', 'one', 'episode.In', 'season', '1', 'will', 'confess', 'hardly', 'character', 'development', 'are', 'being', 'introduced', 'everyone', 'However', 'Wolfram', 'only', 'character', 'signs', 'character', 'development', 'season', '2', 'different', 'person', 'youngest', 'son', 'Von', 'Bielefeld', 'previous', 'family', 'charge', 'ruling', 'Mazoku', 'kingdom', 'very', 'stuck', 'up', 'spoiled', 'obnoxious', 'not', 'likable', 'character', 'even', 'tsundere', 'beginning', 'only', 'one', 'episode', 'Yuuri', 'knock', 'sense', 'mean', 'accidentally', 'proposing', 'slapping', 'cheek', 'then', 'dueling', 'getting', 'butt', 'kicked', 'process', 'could', 'literally', 'save', 'Love', 'first', 'punch', 'two', 'Wolfram', 'engagement', 'Yuuri', 'very', 'seriously', 'Yes', 'played', 'comedy', 'shippers', 'be', 'noted', 'later', 'series', 'relationship', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'comedy', 'anymore', 'given', 'how', 'Wolfram', 'pride', 'being', 'Yuuri', 'fiance', 'actually', 'falling', 'love', 'mean', 'get', 'couple', 'episodes', 'developing', 'love', 'other', 'as', 'much', 'Yuuri', 'being', 'gay', 'irony', 'world', 'homosexuality', ""n't"", 'problem', 'Race', 'later', 'certain', 'event', 'Wolfram', 'finally', 'change', 'person', 'will', 'be', 'covered', 'season', '2', 'review.Overall', 'great', 'series', 'start', ""'re"", 'find', 'homoerotic', 'subtext', 'series', 'probably', 'one', 'few', 'series', 'believable', 'calling', 'series', 'yaoi', 'even', 'shonen', 'ai', 'comedy', 'adventure', 'action', 'yes', 'lot', 'fighting', 'given', 'how', 'war', 'such', 'huge', 'role', 'series', 'split', 'personality', 'Yuuri', 'fights', 'split', 'personality', 'when', 'angry', 'cross-dressing', 'lot', 'drama', 'end', 'season', '1', 'very', 'well-balanced', 'package', 'retrospect~']",N/A

1249064,AHF97M45JFCB,B0023S4A5S,ONENEO,"[18, 18]","You could certainly be forgiven if you were initially suspicious of any title that opens with the premise of a schoolboy getting a ""swirly"".  In case you aren't familiar with the technique, it is one in which a bully or group of bullies take a weaker individual, flip them upside down, dip their face into the toilet and flush.  In normal circumstances, aside from being terribly unhygienic, the only long-term affect to the victim is a bit of a tall, twisted hairdo.  Believe it or not, Kyo kara Maoh! Opens with our lead character on the receiving end of one such tactic only rather than simply twisting his do, this toilet happens to be a transporter to a magical realm.  We don't even want to know if it worked on the same principle for countless not-so-pleasant flushes, but either way...Released in full season collections, Funimation is once again bringing the Geneon classic title to the masses.  At the time of this review's writing both the first and second volume have been released.  The first box set (Season 1) contains 39 episodes across nine discs (thin packs within a very attractive cardboard slipcase).  The second box set consists of the 37 episodes that constitute the complete second season but since this review if of the first release, let's stick to those specs for now.The collection comes in at a whopping 975-minute runtime and packs a nice host of special features.  Among these are a conceptual art and image gallery, textless themes, memory slideshow, promos, and previews for upcoming Funimation releases.Language options are of the sub & dub variety; original Japanese dialog and English dub each presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 and the choice of English subtitles below either.The show wears an appropriate13 & Up rating.  Appropriate because while there's nothing extremely offensive for the youngsters, it's quite possible that children around the age of 13 will get the most entertainment out of the multitude of gags presented here (after all, its doubtful they would have needed my above definition of a swirly).The story goes something like this: Yuri Shibuya happens upon a new and wild world once bullies stick his head in the toilet. After encountering some nobles and discovering that the world as he knew it was no more, our hero discovers that he's the long-awaited Demon King (and here you thought he had it bad enough just surviving high school).It turns out that in this new world (called the ""Great Demon Kingdom""), humans are the enemy and though considered a human in our world, Yuri is classified as a demon there.  Not just any demon at that; but rather the one who could balance out the tension between the humans and the demos.After a brief return to Earth, Yuri is forced to contemplate which world is more to his liking. Long story short, thus begins young Yuri's reign as Demon King.  Did I mention that magic is a fact of life in the Demon Kingdom but the catch is it only works in the thralls of battle?  Yuri will learn these things just as the viewer does and more often than not: it's too little, too late.If your still with me after all of this, let me just say that it was all be completely and hopelessly ridiculous except for one redeeming quality; It's pretty darn funny at times.Kyo kara Maoh! has the distinction of combining fantasy elements with comedic charm to such accord that it harkens back to some of Monty Python's earlier works.  Each episode is driven along by a fantasy inspired plot structure (find the magic sword, figure out a way to get back home, learn how to cast spells, etc.) but actually consists of dozens of silly humorous moments to connect the grander dots.  Need examples? Well Yuri ends up accidentally getting himself engaged to be married (to another man) by the second episode, encounters some jiggly sumo wrestlers, pirates in schoolgirl uniforms, and gets up close and personal to a g-string by the fifth episode!The offbeat and prevalent humor presented here depends heavily on its cast of characters.  Luckily it works, much to the credit of the show's writers.  Wolfram's snappish attitude makes a great counterpoint to Yuri's easygoing nature.  The women aren't forgotten either, take Celi (the former Demon Queen) and her forceful personality and the eccentric inventor Anissina who has more tricks up her sleeve than a Vegas poker pro.The music works really well with upbeat rock beats in the lighter moments that switch subtly to orchestral scores when the tension goes to red alert phase. Geneon's dub, though pale to the efforts of Funimation's more recent stuff, maintains the comedic intentions of the program.  The script, however, does take a few ugly twists in effort to ""Americanize"" some of the jokes and puns.  It is serviceable if you've only experienced the show in English but starts to lose ground once you compare it to the original Japanese script.In all, this is a show that could be considered an instant classic or a blend of sheer strangeness depending entirely upon your mood going in.  The fantasy elements work really well in both languages and the humor is equally addicting (especially in the Japanese version).  However, if you were seeking a well plotted, fantasy adventure, you would probably better off looking into the much-less gimmicked One Piece series.I came in not knowing what to expect and came out quite amused.  It's silly for sure, but sometimes that's exactly what you were looking for, even if you didn't know it.",4,As Fun as it is Strange,1248393600,"07 24, 2009",2009,5464,"['could', 'certainly', 'be',
