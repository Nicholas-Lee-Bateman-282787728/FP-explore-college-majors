1237620,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001TWT0D6,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 3]","2008 had been a great year for Russell Brand.  The British comedian was in the film ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" , host of the 2008 MTV VMA's and appeared in the Disney film ""BEDTIME STORIES"".But what separates Brand from other comedians is his status, a pop icon who looks as if he is a member of a rock band, his self deprecating humor had caught the attention of people worldwide but sometimes infamous.  The MTV VMA's drew the ire of several viewers (especially when he tried to joke around Madonna and A-Rod but most of all his comedy in regards to the Jonas Brothers virginity and their promise rings) and media, his comments on wanting Obama to become the President alienated right wingers and he received death threats.In the UK, his popular radio show drew ire when he and his fellow Radio 2J made prank phone calls to actor Andrew Sachs's about his granddaughter which led to his resignation.  Known for his controversial thoughts on the current news in the world, Brand continues to be one of the more popular celebrities in the UK and even been branded a ladies man winning ""Shagger of the Year Award"" for three years straight.He has made music (cover of the Beatles song ""When I'm Sixty-Four"" and featured twice on the ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" soundtrack) but when it comes to comedy, since 2006, he has amassed many awards in the UK for ""Best Stand Up"" and was ranked by Channel 4 as #69 in the top 100 Greatest Stand-Ups.But if anything, Americans want to know what is so amazing about Russell Brand and now many people can experience the comedy through Brand's DVD ""RUSSELL BRAND IN NEW YORK CITY"" courtesy of Comedy Central.The DVD is quite slick in presentation and compared to other Comedy Central DVD's, the stage setup is actually nicely done.Russell Brand's comedy is fluid as he goes off on himself in regards to comparing his popularity in the UK and America and having to google himself and see what comes up in the search engine.The 2008 MTV VMA Awards could have been a sore subject for Brand to discuss but Brand definitely wanted to let people know what happened behind-the-scenes during the executive meetings.  But also joking about the criticism he received from the award show.  Commenting on Britney Spears, Jonah Brothers and Jordin Sparks comments.Brand also reads death threats from right wing supporters who bashed on him for his comments of support for Obama.  He also discusses his sexuality and telling people he's not gay and loves to be with women. And reading tabloid news about him about his inability to sleep when he's stressed and wondering where the tabloids are getting their stories.Brand then discusses the filming of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and how he goes a bit gay when he is the company of alpha men and having to learn how to surf.  Also, his experience on riding a horse.Also, Brand talks about having to meet the Queen of England and thinking about grabbing her breasts and then ends the show talking about sex and enjoying it.  Especially his love for threesomes with women but not with a woman and a guy and his hilarious take on it.VIDEO & AUDIO:""RUSSELL BRAND IN NEW YORK CITY"" features an elaborate setup and you get a good amount of camera angles of Brand, especially one overlooking the whole theater and overall editing is well done.  Close up and full body shots from various areas near the stage from the front and rear angles and more.  There were a few second clips that the editor chose to use certain noise filters with a blur that felt a bit off but overall, picture quality is clear.  Video is presented in widescreen.As for the audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital and you can hear Brand clearly through your front channel speakers and hear the audience cheering and laughing quite clearly.SPECIAL FEATURES:""RUSSELL BRAND IN NEW YORK CITY"" contains the following special features:* The Notorious 2008 MTV VMA Monologue - (6:26) The controversial opening monologue from the 2008 MTV VMA's featuring Russell Brand going off on Madonna and the Jonas Brothers virginity and promise rings with the look of a few celebs and audiences who seem to be surprised (or dismayed) by Russell Brand's humor.* An Englishman in New York - (10:25) Russell Brand spent a week in Manhattan as he came to New York to shoot his stand-up special for comedy central.  Footage shows the shenanigans of Brand walking through Time Square and being greeted by fans and preparing for his appearance for ""The Late Show with David Letterman"" and photography for the DVD.  Plus behind-the-scenes from the special as Brand goes to meet the audience.* Loose Cannon Drunk Girl - (4:45) This segment focuses on a big fan of Russell Brand who takes the lights off the stage and gives a letter to Russell.  She continually tries to communicate with him and Russell Brand addresses her several times.JUDGMENT CALL:This was my first time seeing Russell Brand, the comedian.  The 2008 MTV VMA's was just not the right setting for his comedy and where he shines is when he can be onstage, uncut and uncensored and the ability to go off and have fun.  This DVD and his performance was the perfect setting for his style and found his entire comedy quite enjoyable and fun!His humor while self deprecating at times is fast, fluid and fierce but fun and hilarious.  His non-stop delivery is flawless and rarely do you see him pause.  He's literally energetic and he goes all out!Because of his popular status and the accomplishments he has done in his career, Brand's comedy is quite fun because his ability to use those situations that people are familiar with and gives you the ability to see things through his perspective behind-the-scenes and his reactions to people who disliked his comedy or his opinions.  It's all off-the-cuff and scripted or not scripted, you can tell that doing shows like this where he's not having to guard what he says, this is where Russell Brand shines!Rarely do you see someone those controversial for his opinions worldwide and then his ability to go use it as a comedy routine.  And most of all, he has the look of a pop star, very flamboyant on stage and calling himself an ""S&M; Willy Wonka"".  He definitely has an interesting comedic delivery and he's quite unique in presentation.Overall, ""RUSSELL BRAND IN NEW YORK CITY"" is a slick production.  Comedy Central definitely gave this popular comedian special treatment as he has a beautiful stage setup (most comedians rarely get any set design on stage aside from a stool and bottles of water) and a wide range of camera angles showcasing Brand and the audience.I definitely enjoyed Russell Brand's comedy performance.  I'm a big fan of British comedy but for those wondering if they will like it because he's a British comedian, his comedy routine is actually quite easy for Americans to understand and follow.  So, no worries there.So if you are curious about Russell Brand's style of comedy, definitely give ""RUSSELL BRAND IN NEW YORK CITY"" a try!",4,"For those who have wondered why so much hype and allure over this British comedian, this DVD showcases Brand's witty humor!",1243641600,"05 30, 2009",2009,6981,"['2008', 'had', 'been', 'great', 'year', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'British', 'comedian', 'was',

1237622,A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD,B001TWT0D6,"Heath Buckmaster ""_heath_""","[1, 2]","Russell Brand is pretty well known for being a sex addict, he talks about this extensively in his stand-up as well as his written material. This comedy special definitely covers a number of sexual topics, but is also generally funny.He has a delivery style that reminds me a lot of Eddie Izzard and Ricky Gervais (though I think Eddie Izzard is probably #1 in the list) - it often takes the audience a moment to realize what has been said and then get the humour in it. Personally, I like that style of humour because it's smart, and makes you think - it's not slapstick.There's plenty of ""language"" in this performance, but it's not distracting. I think where the challenge comes in is that Russell isn't as well known here in the US as he is in the UK, and he's still recovering from a lot of negative publicity he's received over the years because of drug addiction. He is also relatively unknown unless you saw the movie Forgetting Sarah Marshall, or have seen him on some of his MTV appearances.If you're looking for a good basic laugh of Brit humour, then the price is right for this dvd (which has mysteriously been dropping in price almost every month) - and don't get me wrong, there are plenty of laughs in this performance, but if you're looking for the upper echelon of Brit humour then go for Izzard or Gervais.",3,"Elements of Izzard and Gervais, highly sexual humour focused",1244505600,"06 9, 2009",2009,1324,"['Russell', 'Brand', 'pretty', 'well', 'known', 'being', 'sex', 'addict', 'extensively', 'stand-up', 'as', 'well', 'written', 'material', 'comedy', 'special', 'definitely', 'number', 'sexual', 'topics', 'also', 'generally', 'funny.He', 'delivery', 'style', 'lot', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'think', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'probably', '1', 'list', 'often', 'audience', 'moment', 'realize', 'what', 'been', 'said', 'then', 'get', 'humour', 'Personally', 'like', 'style', 'humour', 'smart', 'think', 'not', 'plenty', 'language', 'performance', 'not', 'distracting', 'think', 'where', 'challenge', 'Russell', ""n't"", 'as', 'well', 'known', 'here', 'US', 'UK', 'still', 'recovering', 'lot', 'negative', 'publicity', 'received', 'years', 'drug', 'addiction', 'also', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'saw', 'movie', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'have', 'seen', 'MTV', 'appearances.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'basic', 'laugh', 'Brit', 'humour', 'then', 'price', 'right', 'dvd', 'mysteriously', 'been', 'dropping', 'price', 'almost', 'month', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'performance', ""'re"", 'looking', 'upper', 'echelon', 'Brit', 'humour', 'then', 'go', 'Izzard', 'Gervais']",Russell Brand: in New York City - Extended & Uncensored

I laughed only occasionally; the VMA extra on the dvd was the best part of the whole dvd, mainly for how shocked the audience was.But the stand-up here is really very boring in general, unless you're one of the worshipping fans like those in the audience at this show, who seem there to watch his hairdo and laugh at any and every thing he says, funny or not. And most of it really isn't. Brand focuses on his favorite subject--himself--and it sounds like most of his best material was in the book and these are just leftover jokes.I'd save my money and just watch his many clips on youtube, most of which are far funnier than the stuff here.This material is barely three stars. For five stars, watch some of Brand's heroes do truly high-quality bits, like Bill Hicks or Carlin or Pryor. Judging from this show, RB has a long way to go to reach their level of intelligence in material. He's a very smart guy, no doubt, but the jokes here are not. They seem like outtakes from a much funnier show. He's funny to watch move around, but I watch comedy for the material first and foremost; cuteness and hair styles don't make weak jokes funnier.But give him time: once he stops worshipping the ground he walks on and gets down to commenting intelligently on things other than himself, as on the VMA clip, he might just end up one of the best comedians of our time.But being cute is not the same as being a great comic.",3,Nowhere near as funny as his book or his role in FSarahM,1265587200,"02 8, 2010",2010,1507,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'Brand', 'FSM', 'loved', 'autobio', 'material', 'here', 'weak', 'best', 'laughed', 'only', 'occasionally', 'VMA', 'extra', 'dvd', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'whole', 'dvd', 'mainly', 'how', 'shocked', 'audience', 'was.But', 'stand-up', 'here', 'really', 'very', 'boring', 'general', ""'re"", 'one', 'worshipping', 'fans', 'audience', 'show', 'who', 'seem', 'there', 'watch', 'hairdo', 'laugh', 'thing', 'not', 'most', 'really', ""n't"", 'Brand', 'favorite', 'subject', 'most', 'best', 'material', 'was', 'book', 'are', 'just', 'leftover', 'jokes.I', ""'d"", 'save', 'money', 'just', 'watch', 'many', 'clips', 'youtube', 'most', 'are', 'far', 'funnier', 'stuff', 'here.This', 'material', 'barely', 'three', 'stars', 'five', 'stars', 'watch', 'Brand', 'heroes', 'do', 'truly', 'high-quality', 'bits', 'Bill', 'Hicks', 'Carlin', 'Pryor', 'Judging', 'show', 'RB', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'reach', 'level', 'intelligence', 'material', 'very', 'smart', 'guy', 'doubt', 'jokes', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'seem', 'outtakes', 'much', 'funnier', 'show', 'funny', 'watch', 'move', 'around', 'watch', 'comedy', 'material', 'first', 'foremost', 'cuteness', 'hair', 'styles', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'weak', 'jokes', 'funnier.But', 'give', 'time', 'once', 'worshipping', 'ground', 'down', 'commenting', 'intelligently', 'things', 'other', 'VMA', 'clip', 'might', 'just', 'end', 'up', 'one', 'best', 'comedians', 'time.But', 'being', 'cute', 'not', 'same', 'being', 'great', 'comic']",Russell Brand: in New York City - Extended & Uncensored

If you have trouble discerning British accents, you will get used to Brand's quickly, so don't let the negative comments of one reviewer deter you from this comedic masterwork. Understand that Brand plays a ""rock star"" character that is partly (not entirely) autobiographical -- hence the outlandish makeup, attire, and hairdo.Watch Brand as the imaginary British rock star Aldous Snow in the hit Judd Apatow comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall for a taste of what you can expect to enjoy when you watch his stand-up routine, which is the best I have seen in years. It is both outrageously crude and hilariously brilliant, which is a hard balance to reach! His humor features razor-sharp wordplay and the most fantastic, biting lines -- you will find yourself laughing out loud, spewing forth whatever beverage you happen to be consuming while watching his routine. Brand's routine is nearly flawless, smart, well-timed, and sharp: Brand spills anecdotes about his wild, drugged-out sex-addict (former?) life, shares inside details about the filming of Sarah Marshall that are wonderful, and recounts zingers about his (in)famous stint as the MTV video awards host that will make you wonder if people should have licenses in order to be able to send emails to celebrities.You won't be disappointed!",5,"Ignore the negative review.
