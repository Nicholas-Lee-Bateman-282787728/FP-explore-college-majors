Many viewers might find it rather dated, filled with cliches and Dynasty-like dialogue but it's quite interesting and infectious from start to end.The characters are two dimensional &amp; the plot goes on like a soap-opera.

361634,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,6303168248,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[5, 7]","By the time ""Sins"" aired as a made-for-television miniseries in 1986 on CBS Joan Collins was at the top of her craft. She was the highest-paid actress on network television (a distinction she deserved for her soaring portrayal as Alexis on ""Dynasty"") and she was in demand for other TV roles. The first major production she worked on was this well-received miniseries, airing in February, 1986. Not only was Joan starring in ""Sins"", but she was the executive producer who worked alongside her then husband, Peter Holm, now known as ""The Swede"".The miniseries is full of glamour, opulence, and elegence, all elements of a good Joan Collins movie. ""Sins"" deals with a character named Helene (Collin's role) who endured a turbulent childhood, witnessing her mother's rape and losing her brother and sister to the Nazis. Eventually, Helene makes a life for herself in the fashion world as others try to destroy her. Helene is also determined to track down those her caused her family harm and to become reaquainted with her siblings.This marks the first time ""Sins"" has received a DVD release here in North America, although it was (like ""Monte Carlo"") released in Europe on DVD via Region 2.The movie was shot in New York City and Paris and its obvious from the production values that money was no option. The supporting cast is excellent headed by Lauren Hutton, sexy Timothy Dalton, Gene Kelly, and James Farentino (Joan's co-star in her first season of ""Dynasty"").CBS' main competitor, NBC, wanted to sink ""Sins"" on its original airing. On the first night the peacock network aired the then #1 rated series on American television, ""The Cosby Show"" against it as well as airing their epic minieseries ""Peter The Great"" with an all-star cast. Joan and ""Sins"" creamed the competition proving someone with the acting chops and class that Joan had could never be beaten.""Sins"" was followed later that year by the least successful ""Monte Carlo"" also starring Joan.",5,"""The Best of Joan""",1302220800,"04 8, 2011",2011,1958,"['time', 'Sins', 'aired', 'made-for-television', 'miniseries', '1986', 'CBS', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'was', 'top', 'craft', 'was', 'highest-paid', 'actress', 'network', 'television', 'distinction', 'deserved', 'soaring', 'portrayal', 'Alexis', 'Dynasty', 'was', 'demand', 'other', 'TV', 'roles', 'first', 'major', 'production', 'worked', 'was', 'well-received', 'miniseries', 'airing', 'February', '1986', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'Joan', 'starring', 'Sins', 'was', 'executive', 'producer', 'who', 'worked', 'then', 'husband', 'Peter', 'Holm', 'now', 'known', 'Swede', '.The', 'miniseries', 'full', 'glamour', 'opulence', 'elegence', 'elements', 'good', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'movie', 'Sins', 'deals', 'character', 'named', 'Helene', 'Collin', 'role', 'who', 'endured', 'turbulent', 'childhood', 'witnessing', 'mother', 'rape', 'losing', 'brother', 'sister', 'Nazis', 'Eventually', 'Helene', 'life', 'herself', 'fashion', 'world', 'others', 'try', 'destroy', 'Helene', 'also', 'determined', 'track', 'down', 'caused', 'family', 'harm', 'become', 'reaquainted', 'siblings.This', 'first', 'time', 'Sins', 'received', 'DVD', 'release', 'here', 'North', 'America', 'was', 'Monte', 'Carlo', 'released', 'Europe', 'DVD', 'Region', '2.The', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Paris', 'obvious', 'production', 'values', 'money', 'was', 'option', 'supporting', 'cast', 'excellent', 'headed', 'Lauren', 'Hutton', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'James', 'Farentino', 'Joan', 'co-star', 'first', 'season', 'Dynasty', '.CBS', 'main', 'competitor', 'NBC', 'wanted', 'sink', 'Sins', 'original', 'airing', 'first', 'night', 'peacock', 'network', 'aired', 'then', '1', 'rated', 'series', 'American', 'television', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'as', 'well', 'airing', 'epic', 'minieseries', 'Peter', 'Great', 'all-star', 'cast', 'Joan', 'Sins', 'creamed', 'competition', 'proving', 'someone', 'acting', 'chops', 'class', 'Joan', 'had', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'beaten', 'Sins', 'was', 'followed', 'later', 'year', 'least', 'successful', 'Monte', 'Carlo', 'also', 'starring', 'Joan']",Sins VHS
