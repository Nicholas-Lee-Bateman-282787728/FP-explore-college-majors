Jimmy Steward plays the widowed janitor who's only companion is his cat. Through this movie one can see what lonely people go through during the holidays and how one person, one act of kindness can make a huge difference.I highly recommend this movie, especially as we near the holidays. Hopefully it will help make a difference.

The film is certainly a big let down and not like a normal classic Christmas movie. It was more like I watched a movie about people having weird dreams or hallucinations from the effects of drugs than a Christmas time movie. If you love good Christmas movies, and are hoping to find good hidden ones, this one is not worth buying. Maybe if Netflix picks it up or you find it at a local library rent it, but I seriously doubt most people would ever watch this a second time.",1,Poorly done and very weird - Not for children,1315785600,"09 12, 2011",2011,602,"['had', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'little', 'known', 'Christmas', 'classics', 'list', 'was', 'just', 'poorly', 'done', 'very', 'weird', 'film', 'certainly', 'big', 'let', 'down', 'not', 'normal', 'classic', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'watched', 'movie', 'people', 'having', 'weird', 'dreams', 'hallucinations', 'effects', 'drugs', 'Christmas', 'time', 'movie', 'love', 'good', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'are', 'hoping', 'find', 'good', 'hidden', 'ones', 'one', 'not', 'worth', 'buying', 'Maybe', 'Netflix', 'up', 'find', 'local', 'library', 'rent', 'seriously', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'ever', 'watch', 'second', 'time']",N/A
