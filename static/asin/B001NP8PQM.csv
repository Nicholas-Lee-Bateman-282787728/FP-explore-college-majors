1220402,A2X449RA8YXYIB,B001NP8PQM,A. E. Pagano,"[0, 0]","The Yardbirds left the world with a guitar legacy with the likes of Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck add to that list their contemporary, Jimi Hendrix and that pretty much sets the standard for blues-rock guitar. Jeff Beck started his legacy with his late '60 psychdelic blues, morphed into hard driving R&B player, and then the in the '70's combined all those elements into his present fusion instrumental direction. Listening to Jeff is always a treat, but watching him is even better. His virtuosity seems effortless but alwasys inspired and unique. There are a lot if high points on this DVD but Billy Cobham's ""Spectrum"", Jeff's own Indian/eastern inspired ""Nadia"" and the vocal piece with Imogene Heap ""Blanket"" all prove everything Jeff touches turns to guitar gold. Whether playing all out rocking riffs or restrained heart-wrenching melodies Jeff leaves an indelible stamp on everything he plays. From beginning to end which unites him with Eric Clapton on two blues numbers (Where was Jimmy Page? You'll see Robert Plant in the audience grinning ear to ear), this is worth every penny and more. The CD does not include the vocal numbers nor the Clapton stuff which for me really put the icing on this cake. Oh and the band Colaiuta, Moran and Wilkenfled smoke throughout.",5,Guitar legend,1244160000,"06 5, 2009",2009,1287,"['Yardbirds', 'left', 'world', 'guitar', 'legacy', 'likes', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'Jeff', 'Beck', 'add', 'list', 'contemporary', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'pretty', 'much', 'standard', 'blues-rock', 'guitar', 'Jeff', 'Beck', 'started', 'legacy', 'late', ""'60"", 'psychdelic', 'blues', 'morphed', 'hard', 'driving', 'R', 'B', 'player', 'then', ""'70"", 'combined', 'elements', 'present', 'fusion', 'instrumental', 'direction', 'Listening', 'Jeff', 'always', 'treat', 'watching', 'even', 'better', 'virtuosity', 'effortless', 'alwasys', 'inspired', 'unique', 'are', 'lot', 'high', 'points', 'DVD', 'Billy', 'Cobham', 'Spectrum', 'Jeff', 'own', 'Indian/eastern', 'inspired', 'Nadia', 'vocal', 'piece', 'Imogene', 'Heap', 'Blanket', 'prove', 'everything', 'Jeff', 'guitar', 'gold', 'playing', 'rocking', 'riffs', 'restrained', 'heart-wrenching', 'melodies', 'Jeff', 'indelible', 'stamp', 'everything', 'beginning', 'end', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'two', 'blues', 'numbers', 'Where', 'was', 'Jimmy', 'Page', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Robert', 'Plant', 'audience', 'grinning', 'ear', 'ear', 'worth', 'penny', 'more', 'CD', 'not', 'include', 'vocal', 'numbers', 'Clapton', 'stuff', 'really', 'put', 'icing', 'cake', 'Oh', 'band', 'Colaiuta', 'Moran', 'Wilkenfled', 'smoke']",Jeff Beck: Performing This Week...

1220403,A303MONZTW2M4Y,B001NP8PQM,"anthonious ""anthonious""","[12, 13]","Once upon a time there were three British players. Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, and Jeff Beck.Eric Clapton left the Yardbirds and defined the super group, the one-off project, and the guest appearance. Ordained god-like by the Baby-Boomers... Then there is Jimmy Page, all he ever did was reshape the Delta blues into hard-rock, become a studio wiz and riff master, and craft the imploded Yardbirds into a little band called ""Led Zeppelin"", maybe you have heard of them.This leads us to Jeff Beck... Visionary, eccentric, reclusive, and in my opinion probably more talented than Clapton and Page put together.This DVD... Performing This Week: Live at Ronnie Scott's is the kind of performance that will inspire those that never played to pick a guitar instead of a video game, for Beck is what being a ""Guitar Hero"" is all about. On the flip-side if you are a musician, you might want to avoid this DVD... it might just be the kind of thing that makes you decide to learn to sell real estate.Beck strolls through his catalog and blends genres, styles and music flawlessly. Always allowing his band equal time to shine, Jeff Beck dances in and out of their fills, lines, and beats like Baryshnikov with a strat.He welcomes the vocal talents of Joss Stone and Imogen Heap and they add youth and fire to the night... there is a noticeable shift when Clapton joins in for a couple of spot on blues numbers. With Clapton Beck seemed old enough to be a Yardbird... with the rest of the band he played like ""Free Bird""... his music bouncing between 1965 and 2025... Beck creates a sonic landscape that shows where Satriani wants to go but can't find the map.Simply outstanding... not surprising if you are a fan, but a wonder to own and to share. If there is anyone out that thinks of Jeff Beck as that ""other"" Yardbird guitarist... they should pick up this DVD... the CD too while they are at it.",5,"Hail, Hail Jeff Beck",1247270400,"07 11, 2009",2009,1887,"['Once', 'time', 'were', 'three', 'British', 'players', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'Jeff', 'Beck.Eric', 'Clapton', 'left', 'Yardbirds', 'defined', 'super', 'group', 'one-off', 'project', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Ordained', 'god-like', 'Baby-Boomers', 'Then', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'all', 'ever', 'did', 'was', 'reshape', 'Delta', 'blues', 'hard-rock', 'become', 'studio', 'wiz', 'riff', 'master', 'craft', 'imploded', 'Yardbirds', 'little', 'band', 'called', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'maybe', 'have', 'heard', 'them.This', 'Jeff', 'Beck', 'Visionary', 'eccentric', 'reclusive', 'opinion', 'probably', 'more', 'talented', 'Clapton', 'Page', 'put', 'together.This', 'DVD', 'Performing', 'Week', 'Live', 'Ronnie', 'Scott', 'kind', 'performance', 'will', 'inspire', 'never', 'played', 'pick', 'guitar', 'instead', 'video', 'game', 'Beck', 'what', 'being', 'Guitar', 'Hero', 'about', 'flip-side', 'are', 'musician', 'might', 'want', 'avoid', 'DVD', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'kind', 'thing', 'decide', 'learn', 'sell', 'real', 'estate.Beck', 'strolls', 'catalog', 'genres', 'styles', 'music', 'flawlessly', 'Always', 'allowing', 'band', 'equal', 'time', 'shine', 'Jeff', 'Beck', 'dances', 'fills', 'lines', 'beats', 'Baryshnikov', 'strat.He', 'vocal', 'talents', 'Joss', 'Stone', 'Imogen', 'Heap', 'add', 'youth', 'fire', 'night', 'noticeable', 'shift', 'when', 'Clapton', 'couple', 'spot', 'blues', 'numbers', 'Clapton', 'Beck', 'seemed', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'Yardbird', 'rest', 'band', 'played', 'Free', 'Bird', 'music', 'bouncing', '1965', '2025', 'Beck', 'sonic', 'landscape', 'where', 'Satriani', 'go', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'map.Simply', 'outstanding', 'not', 'surprising', 'are', 'fan', 'wonder', 'own', 'share', 'anyone', 'thinks', 'Jeff', 'Beck', 'other', 'Yardbird', 'guitarist', 'should', 'pick', 'up', 'DVD', 'CD', 'too', 'are']",Jeff Beck: Performing This Week...

It is no fluke that he is widely considered to be oneof the greatest guitar players ever. That's actually a no-brainer. Any parent that buys a guitar for their young kid should also include a copyof this DVD and make then watch it every day for a month before even letting them touch their guitar. Jeff's touch on the guitar is an absolutething of beauty. His use of the whammy bar is unlike anyone else I have seen and he coaxes such sweet sounds from his Strat. I was commenting to aguitarist friend how Jeff's Strat doesn't even have that identifiable Start tone that you hear from guys like Blackmore, Hendrix, Stevie Ray, etc.Jeff's sound is all his own. And when you see the look on Jeff's face he was clearly in a good place during this recording. He is truly enjoyinghimself and it's great to see his ear to ear grin.The band, what a band! Tal Wilkenfeld on bass looks 12 years old but don't let that fool you. She can play and she came to play. The fact that she'sin Jeff's touring band says it all. Drummer Vinnie Colauita needs no introduction and if he does then you haven't been paying attention. Ask anyone inthe know about Vinnie's playing and 10 times out of 10 it will be something like ""oh yeah, Vinnie!"" I am not familiar with keys man Jason Rebello but I'msure I'll be hearing more from this guy. He's great on this DVD.Get this DVD as it will be a treat watching a master guitarist at work.

I politely asked her if I could sort of existentially wander around the store while she was picking-things-up-and-putting-them-down-and-then-recircling-and-doing-that-all-over, her method of shopping.  My request was favorably granted, and not only did I run into my Keyboard Player whom I hadn't seen in about 6 months, but I also spoke with my Preacher's Wife, there shopping, too.  I had to meet Dearest ""in 20 minutes"" in the food section, so I next literally ran back to the DVD, etc, department.  Ugh.  I am NOT interested in the ""New Millenium/fifth goodbye tour"" Eagles, Celophane Dion, or the Anti-Hank, Garthie B.  But just as I was thinking, ""I gotta RUN, but whaddya expect?"" I glanced down and saw a Jeff Beck - Jeff Beck, now! - DVD with a ""cutout"" price, only 9 bucks.  Whoah!  That Performer!  That Price!  And then (duh!) viewing the DVD is a treat. Beck does material from nearly all his career, and the band is (horrid eighties adjective, here) AWESOME!  I knew about the drummer, Vinnie Colaiuta, and I was impressed with the new keyboard player, Jason Rebello (no masturbatory synthesizer bleets, bless his heart...in fact, it sounded like he had whatever set to sound like a Hammond B-3), but - WHEW!!! - that bass player, Tai Wilkenfeld - is PHENOMINAL.  Looking at and listening TO her, I could only think, ""Wow, I didn't know Jaco had had an affair with Farrah!""  And ol' Slow(er)hand, EC, comes on at the encore, and does a blessedly familiar 12 bar-A-D-E blues, and it makes you wonder, ""Yardbirds........what IF?""  The only drawback - folks, these are major league downers! - are the two ""guest vocalists"" JB drags out.  Forgotten-but-not-quite-gone Joss Stone ""does"" ""People Get Ready,"" and her vocal is an insult both to the great Curtis Mayfield who wrote the song, and even to Rod Stewart, a gent I have no great love for, who had ""covered"" the tune with JB back in 1984.  Bad as ""Joss"" was, this other...""individual"" that came out to ""sing,"" Imogen Heap, looked and sounded like the illicit progeny of Tiny Tim and Kate Pierson (B52s).  A great deal of gasping and grunting, I reckon she found, ""sexy"" - NOT!  But still, so as not to close this review negatively:  except for that performance that JB did on the last ""Crossroads"" thing, I'm not aware of any other DVDs of him (unless you have a boot of the 1983 multiple sclerosis concert for Ronnie Lane).

He now relies on a wonderful finger picking style-even more power!Ronnie Scott's is obviously a comfortable venue for the audience and the band. The band compliment and inspire Jeff. I'd heard numerous times of his great new bassist Tal Wilkenfeld, she has major chops! Vinnie Colaiuta on drums and Jason Rabello on keys round out the band.

Now, I pretty much have an idea of all his guitar-playing talents......and it's even more awesome than I had guessed they would be.  This review, thus, is for people not all that familiar with Beck's talents. If you already are, you've already bought this DVD.In  this concert, you see Beck play everything from jazz to blues to rock to  ballads to fusion.  The camerawork is very good in that you really get a good look at Jeff's ability on the guitar. You see how he produces some of his amazing sounds.You'll also see what a great band he has put together. Vinnie Colaiuta on drums, Jason Rebello on keyboards and Tal Wilkenfeld on bass are all exceptional musicians and fun to watch. All four members of this group can be seen constantly smiling and really enjoying themselves.  That goes for the three guest stars, too, who are fantastic in here: Joss Stone, Imogen Heap and Eric Clapton.A great addition to the Blu-Ray disc, and a reason to buy it, is the bonus material beginning with the seven-song rockabilly set with Beck and The Big Town Playboys.

If your idea of guitar nirvana is a hair-band shredding robotic scales at blinding speed then you will need to look elsewhere for your bliss.  Jeff Beck is nothing if not a master of good taste, selecting notes judiciously then caefully bending, stroking and coaxing them to speak a sonic language all his own.  He walks effortlessly between the disparate worlds of rock, jazz and pop.  Joined by guest vocalists Joss Stone and Imogene Heep the performance is well divided into rock, jazz, and fusion instrmental journeys interspersed with moving, crowd-pleasing songs.  I especially enjoyed Imogene Heep's hauntingly soulful renditions.  The rhythm section comprises drum virtuoso Vinny Colaiuta and the seemingly pubescent Tal Wilkenfeld a young curly-haired bass prodigy for whom Mr.Beck displays obvious admiration and encouragement.  The venue is warm and cozy, the audience respectful and appreciative and the acoustics (whether natural or the result of post-production magic) come across as clean and dynamic.  I even think I noticed a certain Robert Plant among the audience members!

Jeff Beck's current band (and a few guests) run through some of the high points of Jeff's lengthy and innovative career, focusing primarily on the jazz fusion style that Jeff helped redefine in the middle 1970s. You're not going to find a lot of heavy rock, and you're definitely not going to hear any of the techno/drum-and-bass that dominates most of Jeff Beck's output over the past decade or so. You will find some of Jeff Beck's best playing ever, and an incredibly supportive and enthusiastic band. I have never seen any guitarist demonstrate the amount of attention to detail and care in playing his material as Jeff Beck does, and this video allows you to see him gently manipulating his tone and volume knobs to achieve the dramatic and expressive dynamics that make him so special.My jaw dropped after the first number and I never really recovered for the remainder of the disc. The musicianship is that good.There's also a lengthy interview with Jeff Beck himself as a bonus, along with a very short segment featuring band interviews.

From the opening notes of Beck's Bolero you get a feel for the small club atmosphere that lets you know right away this is going to be an intimate night of music with you seated in the front row. But the clincher for me was John McLaughlin's Eternity's Breath in track two. I hadn't seen the song list ahead of time, so when Beck launched into that piece, quite unexpectedly for me, and which I had never heard outside the Mahavishnu Orchestra, I transcended the whole experience. Whatever happened after that didn't matter. The ultimate had already been achieved.Of course there is more. There's Nadia, Scatterbrain and Goodbye Porkpie Hat. There's Imogen Heap and Eric Clapton. And there's the Australian high-school dropout, bass phenom Tal Wilkenfeld that everybody's talking about. And yes, she's good. Really good, even though she doesn't get a lot of opportunities to solo. The entire band plays with commitment and a strong sense of unity. I think this is the advantage of the small club. All the performers are able to connect with each other in a way that would not be possible in a large arena.The instruments on stage - particularly Beck's guitar - are not those you would typically hear in a small venue, so some may nitpick about acoustics. However, overall, the audio and video capture on Blu-ray are very good. The camerawork does not detract from the ambience and for the most part avoids the excessive angle changes every two seconds that has become such an irritating part of many concert videos.In conclusion, this is a disc to treasure and a performance I will return to again and again.

This is a MUST purchase and an absolute gift from BECK to all the guitar fans who have waited sooo long for an official pro-shot gig available commercially. Now I'm going to say a few things that do not diminish the 5 stars but are points I'd like to make. 1. Too bad there are no good views/ camera angles of the amazing drum performance of Vinnie!:( 2. Why Beck doesn't speak about Billy Cobham's ""Stratus"" in the interview is a shame too as it would have been interesting to hear his take on Tommy Bolin. 3. This is not BECK at his finest...It's doubtful he will ever play as well infront of cameras as he might other wise. I have seen him countelss times and when this guy goes off it's other- worldy. There are some moments on this DVD in which he does, but it is a tad conservative in places for BECK. Sorry to those that disagree, but that is a fact. ""Big Block"" is a tad rough. I still LOVE this DVD and will upgrade to the Blue -Ray when the prices come down in 2010 (for the rockabilly set).I'll probably take some criticism for that last comment but it is a bit conservative in places.(For him).and yes, I totally understand the amazing dynamics of what he is doing with his right hand which is unmatched by any other player in the world today (That we know of) The guest performances are great too..especially I. Heap...She is awesome! Sorry but Clapton is sooo over-rated...BECK SOARS over him like a vulture waiting for the feeding. Yes, Clapton has his unique blues phrasiology and place in history but just doesn't have anywhere near the creativity of JEFF BECK. I know BECK respects Clapton as a player as well but he just doesn't move me like Beck or other players.(He was great in the late 60's on Mayalls album though! (* AND WITH CREAM) Good move as a selling point though as there are millions of Clapton fans out there. $10.88 at BEST BUY today? Is that a deal??? JEEZ...Incredible.

1220433,A3ZVT943RJ3J2,B001NP8PQM,Ian Martin,"[13, 20]","Finally I have my own copy of this DVD and I was pleasantly surprised that this historic performance at the intimate Ronnie Scotts easily beats their amazing concert in Auckland. (I saw Jeff Beck, Vinnie Colaiuta, Tal Wilkenfeld and Dave Sancious rip through one of the most amazing one and half hours of spell-binding music when they played in Auckland at the end of their Australasian tour (3 February 2009). They pretty much covered all the songs on the Ronnie Scott set list although omitting `Space Boogie' and including I think a Tony Williams ""Lifetime"" track, that Tal seemed to lead.) Yet the DVD is even better because of three reasons:1. The DVD allows you so close that you can see every action of Beck's playing (which even with binoculars I couldn't quite see at the concert)2. There is greater variety in this concert in comparison with their tour as here there is the addition of soulful singing of guest artists. Joss Stone with 'People get ready', Imogen Heap with 'Blanket' and the driving 'Rollin'and Tumblin'' which provides opportunity for Becko to show his support and bluesy side.3. This DVD records the historic magic of two blues songs sung and played by Eric Clapton and Becko...with Jimmy Page watching in the audience. Wow!If you have only heard Jeff Beck then a live performance or this DVD, is a must. I had never seen Jeff Beck play before so was astounded to watch his unique style of brushing the strings with his thumb, caressing the whammy and combined with volume swells producing those tones that only he can do. As you'll see, he doesn't use a pick at all.This is unique in that as far as I am aware this is the first full DVD concert of the drumming maestro, Vinnie Colaiuta (other than specialized Drumming festival DVDs). This intense rock fusion catalogue of Beck's is brilliant with its varied time signatures from reggae to poly-rhythm frenzy to showcase Vinnie's talents - but always within the context of the song and the music. Next to the diminutive figure of Jeff and Tal, Vinnie is a tall man and his enthusiasm, smiles and outright mastery capture and add to all the Richard Bailey, Simon Phillips and Terry Bozzio fills that we know from albums like `Blow by Blow', `Wired', 'Guitar shop' and the rest of the Beck catalogue. To hear Vinnie live is great - watching is an overwhelming marvel.My only criticism of this DVD is that in the first few songs including 'Stratus', the camera work misses most of Vinnie's great fills. This is most frustrating and often the camera panned onto a watching Jeff or the face of a smiling Tal while missing sublime drumming. Fortunately this concert has a enough opportunity to see Vinnie at other times but generally the small venue meant that there are never great views of the drum kit. Fortunately this does not apply to the clear camera work on Jeff's fretboard.Seeing the young Tal on bass melodically groove with these musos all at least 30 years older than her is like watching all the post-Woodstock generations salute the music that we have come to know as rock fusion. There is a sense of togetherness and fun as they all interact and watch each other. Jason Rebello is literally out of the picture for the first quarter of the concert but later takes a more prominent role and takes a number of great solos.As usual Eagle Vision have exemplary production qualities and the sound, 5.1 and DTS, is magnificent.Jeff, doesn't speak much other than to thank guest artists and the audience at the end. He just plays his heart out. Hammering, tapping, wrenching and bending strings, Jeff shows how far he has explored where his contemporaries of that generation have never ventured. This best value DVD is an historic showcase that salutes the master guitarist in top form still playing as if there are no tomorrows.",5,Better than their 2009 tour!

There are many fine guitarists on the world stage but few can match Beck's equal mastery of so many varied and differing genres including blues, rock, jazz, soul, funk, reggae and Asian influences - and all heard to perfection on this inspired night.The four-piece band features the outstanding talents of Vinnie Colaiuta on drums, Jason Rebello on keyboards and the new sensation on bass, the talented young Tal Wilkenfield from Australia. The Stevie Wonder 'Cause we've ended as lovers' is a good track to sample the multi-talented line-up, but every track is a winner in its own way.The guest artists, Joss Stone, Imogen Heap and Eric Clapton all make valuable contributions and there is a very enjoyable extended extra bonus with 7 items featuring the opening set played by the Rockability Band who all happened to be in London at the time and who reprise an earlier disc which had never before been played 'live'.Eagle Rock has provided a recording with involving camera work with crisp imaging. The sound is presented in excellent  DTS 5.1, DD 5.1 and stereo.This will give enormous pleasure to anyone to whom the program appeals and is a perfect example of Jeff Beck at the very top of his considerable game.

1220435,AW1493ZQTQ2ET,B001NP8PQM,Irfan A. Alvi,"[3, 3]","I've been a guitarist for three decades and have always appreciated Jeff Beck, though some other guitarists have admittedly appealed to me more.  Nevertheless, I had to give this DVD a try, and my expectations and hopes were far surpassed.  I was reminded why Beck is deservedly a legend, and indeed still going strong.  His style uniquely blends rock, jazz, blues, and much more, and his artistic expression reaches the level of complete virtuosity.  He doesn't simply play the guitar, but rather makes it a material extension of his soul.  I was deeply moved many times during this performance, and there are moments of tender beauty so subtle you could almost cry.  Simply put, I was blown away.  Beck is truly a creative original, and there will never again be another quite like him.Of course most of the credit for this magnificent performance has to go to Beck, but let's not altogether forget his excellent supporting band.  Vinnie Colaiuta is himself a legendary drummer of seemingly limitless ability, and he works so hard that he winds up drenched in sweat.  Tal Wilkenfield is a bassist who looks 14 years old, but plays like she's three times that age (and understandably seems totally stoked to be part of this band).  Jason Robello delivers the goods on keyboards, capably alternating between support and solos as his role requires.  And the guest artists are also a nice touch, with Joss Stone and Imogen Heap delivering vocals which nicely complement the band, and Eric Clapton serving as icing on the cake (it's great to see these legends honoring each other by performing together).This performance was surely magical for those in attendance, and this DVD captures a decent helping of that magic for the rest of us.

1220436,A3LKGCBWNFVEJ6,B001NP8PQM,"Ivan Brantes Salinas ""Ivan Brantes""","[0, 0]","Since the early days with The Tridents and The Yardbirds Jeff Beck has been innovating to the point of making the electric guitar an extension of his body.  Beck has gone through differents styles and territories, sometime he is on the rock field and soon after he is playing funk, jazz rock o even reggae: Beck has no boundaries as he is constantly changing.  Without having a huge following he is one of the most respected musicians around, even by his own colleagues like Jimmy Page (he is seen on the video) and Eric Clapton.This DVD is a great example of all the above as we can see Beck on differents stages and styles, doing a fantastic quick resume of his carreer as a musician, something like a presentation card.Beck is wise enough to get musicians that made the perfect mixture between experience and quality (V. Colaiuta an ex Zappa member) and freshness (T. Wilkenfeld) and not forgetting the keyboard player (J Rebello) that thanks to the current technology can jump to a Minimoog sound with just sliding a couple of knobs so he can match Jan Hammer duets with Beck.  He does a great work (great subtle Hammond organ playing as well).By the way Beck's 2010 tour band shows another great move including now Narada Michael Walden on Drums and Rhonda Smith on bass (ex Prince musician).A special mention to guest artist.

Kraut,"[2, 2]","I'm always turning my friend Ricky on to all kinds of music and he amply repaid me today when he played me this concert DVD of who I believe to be the most nuanced, sensitive, versatile guitarist of all time. It's easy to imagine Clapton's jitters as he took the stage to share a couple of encores with the group, having just witnessed Beck's dazzling display of boundless creativity and virtuosity. But Eric is a legend, too, and puts in a very respectable performance, keeping pace with Jeff and creating a wonderful return-to-roots mini-set that takes you back to the mid-sixties when the two of them were Yardbirds, worshipping Sonny Boy Williamson and the like. Beck does so much with tone and attack here that words will never do his performance justice. He plays with the subtlety of a classically trained musician, the improvisational fluidity of a great jazzman and the grit and power of rock's best musicians.One of the visual highlights for me was watching all the smiling on stage. These players looked like they were having as much fun as those watching, particularly the Australian prodigy Tal Wilkenfeld, who's probably looking at a career that will span the better part of this century. She has an engaging, innocent presence that seems to bring out something in Beck that compliments it.I wonder what Jimmy Paige was thinking, as he sat, along with Robert Plant, in the intimate, relatively small audience. Was he also called up to play, but the material wasn't up to acceptable standards and didn't make the final cut? Or was he just not up for it?And finally, the rockabilly set that's included in the special features is the real thing - like Johnny Burnett with James Burton. Only the drummer's shaved head and Beck's 70s hair-do let you know otherwise.An incredible documentation of some fabulous music.

On my high-end system it is like sitting in the club.  The video is well shot and captures the intimacy of the club.  I like his current band because they have a funky vibe.  His drummer really has a great beat and flashy fills, without overplaying.  I never knew his bass player was young girl -- she can really rip out the funky bass riffs. And the keyboardist fills Jan Hammer's shoes well. There are few places in the performance that are a bit loose, but I think you can expect that on a no-overdubs live performance.This has a lot of additional material that isn't on the CD, and it is well worth having.  People Get Ready is really well sung by Joss Stone (wow is she hot too).  Blanket is a really neat song that changes up the pace of the concert, sung by Imogen Heap. Rollin' and Tumblin' is cool too.  Clapton appears on two songs.

I don't want to read about the DVD version under the blu-ray title.What can one say about this video?  It's Jeff freaking Beck.  When is the last time you saw a JB video?  Never.  At 64, the guy comes out of his shell, get's inducted into the RNR Hall of Fame, goes on tour and does a full length video.This show was taped at Ronnie Scotts in London where JB played for a week.  As far as I can tell, the video is all from the same night.  The band is tight.  I could do without the two guest singers although People Get Ready is a great song.  The songs off of Blow By Blow and Wired are what I came for and the rest to me is filler.  One star off.  I think Tal, the almost jailbait bassist is good but a little gimicky.  She seems to get lost on Space Boogie.  Eric Clapton makes an appearance on a couple tracks and the bonus material is a rock a billy set with the something or other playboys.I was really excited about this video and watched it straight thru on back to back nights.  Jeff Beck is one of the guitar gods.  It's great to see him (live) looking almost the same as he did 30 years ago.  Still has the same hair style and guitar chops.  Never realised before how much he uses his whammy bar to make the sounds he does.  Would like to have seen more just straight ahead playing but that is not jeff's style.  He would be bored and boring just playing the guitar.Good BD picture quality but not the best I have seen.  Jazz Legends just sets the bar for BD PQ and this is full star below that.  The sound is pretty incredible and I have yet to detect a studio over dub but still may have been polished up a bit in post production.  Great sound and 5 stars for that.

But it did take me a while to fully appreciate the rare musical treat that is Performing This Week: Live at Ronnie Scott's.  For one thing, with nearly two and a half hours of music its hard to find time to enjoy it in one sitting. But now that the holidays are upon us, I have been able to give this the close attention it deserves.I admit to having been a sometimey Jeff Beck fan. Actually, I hadn't heard anything new of his since his mid-seventies heyday but thought of albums like Blow By Blow and Wired with delight when this DVD appeared on my horizon. Since this has been reviewed to death and mostly positively, I am not going to analyze it but rather just put in my two cent's worth on what I like and do not like.First you have to know that Beck's band is spectacular and his play seems particularly sharp. My favorite cuts here are: Beck's Bolero, Cause We've Ended As Lovers, Behind the Veil, Scatterbrain, Goodbye Pork Pie Hat/Brush With the Blues, Blanket, Big Block, an interesting A Day In the Life, and the Little Brown Bird duet with Eric Clapton. What don't I like? Well, I think People Get Ready has no place here and I did not particularly care for Rollin' and Tumblin'. Other than those two, this is a pretty mesmerizing set. As for the Beck interview, I have yet to see it so I cannot comment on it. I do note that there is value enough here without it so if you find it enjoyable, so much the better.Though a lot of attention is focused on the young, attractive bass player Tal Wilkenfeld (who looks like Ginger Baker's daughter on the import cover of the Blind Faith album), special plaudits are due drummer Vinnie Colaiuta who did a yeoman's job.

Hearing and seeing Jeff Beck up close in personal for an hour and a half is a real treat. His raunchy 'n ruff sound goes down so well and works killer when he goes soft 'n sweet too. Probably not another rock guitarist with his expressiveness and uncannily accurate pitch on bends tremolo work. What was a GREAT surprise, were the cool guests cameos by Joss Stone, Eric Clapton and especially that Imogene lady, who'd I'd never heard before. The song she sang, Blanket, was such a cool, evocative, perfectly smoky jazzy tune, and you get to see how excellent Jeff is doing rhythm backup playing. Just so cool. The band is top notch too, although I think it would've been extra cool to see Jan Hammer on the keyboards. Him breaking out a moog or mini moog on Led Boots would've been killer. The guy playing is good no doubt though, as is the whole band. The only other bummer was not hearing Freeway Jam and a couple other favorites, but still cool overall.

Well, it was well worth waiting for.  This should cement Beck's reputation as the best rock guitarist alive, and certainly the most unpredictable.The band is the best he's ever worked with by far, these are all world-class musicians.  Vinnie Colaiuta and Jason Rebello are well-known and established, and justifiably so, as this set proves once again.  But bassist Tal Wilkenfeld is a revelation.  She was just 21 when this was filmed, and if you closed your eyes you'd think you were listening to Jaco Pastorius!  But don't close your eyes. :)Highlights are too many to mention, but I'll mention a few anyway. Personally, I can't get ""Stratus"" and ""Behind the Veil"" out of my head.  ""Cause We've Ended as Lovers"" and ""Goodbye Porkpie Hat/Brush With the Blues"" are also outstanding.  John Lennon's classic Beatles track ""A Day in the Life"" has to be seen and heard to be believed.

A virtuoso, and humble to boot... pretty rare combination. And the band members are just as awesome... Tal Wilkenfeld on bass, Vinnie Colaiuta on drums, and Jason Rebello on keyboards- all excellent musicians that put together some fine solos during the concert. Simply great stuff from everybody.The video and audio on this disc are excellent- no problems with either of them as far as I'm concerned (though 96/24 hi-res audio is always nice when you can get it).

Beck's playing is beyond amazing, and to hear someone his age still pushing the envelope of what's possible with an electric guitar is to wonder what all the other geezers are doing (I'm that age, too, so I can say that). The recording here is much better than the companion CD, which is drenched in reverb that puts the music at a distance. Here the sound is immediate and really captures the superlative touch and dynamics that Beck brings to it. The only weak spot here is the editing, which is annoying as hell, never leaving the camera on anything for more than a couple of seconds and jumping all over like a snake on caffeine. I find that this is true of most of the music videos I see these days, and it makes me crazy. If I were at that concert, my eyes wouldn't be jumping around that like (I'd be sick if they did). I'd be focused on the whole band and whoever was soloing at the time. Why can't editors just do the same thing and let the music do the work. This sort of hyper editing seems insulting, as though the music isn't exciting enough. And in this case, it's more than exciting enough.

My only comment for me is; it would have been nice to have Joss Stone sing ""Rollin n Tumblin"" instead of Imogen Heap.  It is a blues song and the way Beck and company played it so funky rockin blues (Jeff in particular), a grittier bluesy voice I think would have made it come across in the true vain that it was being played.  No disrespect for I.H., she is just not a rock singer by any means.  I did like her on the song ""Blanket"" with the band which seems to be more her style.  Beck and Co. pretty much could back any average singer and make them sound pretty damn good.  This man really knows how to compliment a singers voice with his fills and backing chords etc.....to perfection.  This in itself is an amazing talent let alone all the other stuff this man is capable of doing.I am a huge E.C. fan, but his vocals were kind of on the pedestrian side though his guitar work was good as always. But really, this small venue concert at Ronnie Scott's is really about Jeff Beck and his current band.  Totally entertaining and fun to watch.  They all seem to be having so much fun playing together with their smiles and disposition.  Just a thought:  Though Tal Wilkenfeld (bassist) is a young prodigy, energetic and cute to boot, I think she kind of pushes Mr. Beck to play to his up most potential by having this attractive young lady on stage smiling and giving off the ""wow"" factor vibe like this is too good to be true.

If you play guitar, bass, or drums this is an excellent opportunity to take a ""master class"" from the masters. as usual Jeff has surrounded himself with some of the best. Vinnie Colaiuta on drums, From Australia, 23 year old Tal Wilkenfeld on Bass and Jazz keyboardist Jason Robello.I've had the thrill of standing in the wings while Jeff did his sound check a couple of times, this venue would be like everyone being able to be in the wings. hearing Jeff, watching those hands play would be a lifetime memory. Ronnie Scott's is a cozy jazz club with a small stage, the kind of venue that a lot of musicians look forward to playing.With most of the camera time focused on Jeff's hands from about four feet away you can actually see how he plays, this video is a dream come true, not just for any player, but for anybody who loves this music. At the end, Jeff brings his friend Eric Clapton up for a couple of blues tunes. A low point, for me was after Imogen Heap sang one song, she comes back out to take the encore bow with the band. It's not like she is with them, she sang one song.This is a GREAT DVD and should get six stars.",5,"""Where Is That Darned Sixth Star When You Need It""",1250640000,"08 19, 2009",2009,1244,"['actually', 'wrote', 'review', 'already', 'filed', 'CD', 'same', 'name', 'So', ""'ll"", 'Do', 'quick', 'one', 'here', 'play', 'guitar', 'bass', 'drums', 'excellent', 'opportunity', 'take', 'master', 'class', 'masters', 'usual', 'Jeff', 'surrounded', 'best', 'Vinnie', 'Colaiuta', 'drums', 'From', 'Australia', '23', 'year', 'old', 'Tal', 'Wilkenfeld', 'Bass', 'Jazz', 'keyboardist', 'Jason', 'Robello.I', ""'ve"", 'had', 'thrill', 'standing', 'wings', 'Jeff', 'did', 'sound', 'check', 'couple', 'times', 'venue', 'would', 'be', 'everyone', 'being', 'able', 'be', 'wings', 'hearing', 'Jeff', 'watching', 'hands', 'play', 'would', 'be', 'lifetime', 'memory', 'Ronnie', 'Scott', 'cozy', 'jazz', 'club', 'small', 'stage', 'kind', 'venue', 'lot', 'musicians', 'look', 'forward', 'playing.With', 'most', 'camera', 'time', 'focused', 'Jeff', 'hands', 'four', 'feet', 'away', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'how', 'video', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'not', 'just', 'player', 'anybody', 'who', 'music', 'end', 'Jeff', 'friend', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'up', 'couple', 'blues', 'tunes', 'low', 'point', 'was', 'Imogen', 'Heap', 'sang', 'one', 'song', 'back', 'take', 'encore', 'bow', 'band', 'not', 'sang', 'one', 'song.This', 'GREAT', 'DVD', 'should', 'get', 'six', 'stars']",Jeff Beck: Performing This Week...

The whole performance is incredible from beginning to end and this is a moment of pure genius by the best guitarist in the world.  Not only does he create amazing songs but he plays them to a level which is astounding.  I am a fan of Michael Schenker and Eddie Van Halen who are both brilliant but Jeff Beck has an extraordinary talent which puts him on a whole new level plus he brings into his music other musicians who are talented in their own right.  The drummer, keyboardist, bass player and singers he uses are all world class musicians and his choice of songs is perfect.This performance was in a club and he was literally a few feet away from the audience so everyone can see every note he plays so there wasn't room to make any mistakes and he totally pulls it off.  I will not go into describing each individual song because this has probably been done already but this is a world class performance by an amazing guitarist but it is also a superb performance by a great band.  The only weakness in the show is the part where Eric Clapton sings but it was meant to be light-heart-ed so I was OK with it.  I did like Eric's guitar playing and they both work well together.Don't hesitate, just go out and get this!",5,Outstanding - World Class Performance,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,1294,"['am', 'not', 'fan', 'Jeff', 'Beck', 'least', 'was', ""n't"", 'watched', 'whole', 'performance', 'incredible', 'beginning', 'end', 'moment', 'pure', 'genius', 'best', 'guitarist', 'world', 'Not', 'only', 'create', 'amazing', 'songs', 'level', 'astounding', 'am', 'fan', 'Michael', 'Schenker', 'Eddie', 'Van', 'Halen', 'who', 'are', 'brilliant', 'Jeff', 'Beck', 'extraordinary', 'talent', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'music', 'other', 'musicians', 'who', 'are', 'talented', 'own', 'right', 'drummer', 'keyboardist', 'bass', 'player', 'singers', 'are', 'world', 'class', 'musicians', 'choice', 'songs', 'perfect.This', 'performance', 'was', 'club', 'was', 'literally', 'few', 'feet', 'away', 'audience', 'everyone', 'can', 'see', 'note', 'so', 'was', ""n't"", 'room', 'make', 'mistakes', 'totally', 'off', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'describing', 'individual', 'song', 'probably', 'been', 'done', 'already', 'world', 'class', 'performance', 'amazing', 'guitarist', 'also', 'superb', 'performance', 'great', 'band', 'only', 'weakness', 'show', 'part', 'where', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'sings', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'light-heart-ed', 'was', 'OK', 'did', 'Eric', 'guitar', 'playing', 'work', 'well', 'together.Do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'just', 'go', 'out', 'get']",Jeff Beck: Performing This Week...

1220482,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B001NP8PQM,Sky,"[10, 10]","One night back in May 2009 I was out late partying. When I got home I was still in the mood for couple more beers, so I popped on the HD music channel on my cable system (Palladia I think it's called?), and I came across Jeff Beck jamming with this wicked-awesome drummer and some young looking girl (that I thought was probably his daughter) just shredding a bass guitar to pieces.The next morning I woke up to quite a hangover. I had stayed up, watched the whole show, and probably washed down the 6 beers that I had at the party with 6 more watching the Beck performance. So my memory of the show was vague, but also that it was great, although I thought that maybe I enjoyed it more than I otherwise would have because of the alcohol. So I picked it up at Amazon the day or so after...and promptly forgot about watching it again...until recently. I watched this Blu Ray disk last weekend and then again this past weekend. Jeff Beck Live at Ronnie Scott's is one of the best rock performances that I've ever seen.This 2007 show should be held up not only as an example of the way a rock group should perform live, but also as an example for DVD music producers on how to deliver an excellent product. The concert is all musical performance. No indulgence by some videographer that thinks a viewer wants to see effects like cut to black and white, psyschedelic swirling pictures, quick frame to frame edits or other video effects. Long shots of the individual performers dominate the screen throughout and capture not only the great talents of the players, but also the intimacies between the bandmates that are often missed in other DVD musical shows.For this performance at Ronnie Scott's, Beck was accompanied by Vinnie Colaiuta on drums, Jason Rebello on keyboards, and Tal Wilkenfeld on bass guitar. Beck is completely on throughout the show as are his mates. Colaiuta lays down some impossible beats and chops. Wilkenfield blows away many of the bass guitarists that I have on my list of the best. And Rebello is in top form on the keys.The picture and sound are terrific. If you've got a surround system, you're in for a pounding Rock experience. The sound has an amazing 5.1 mix. Most importantly, like I mentioned earlier, the video doesn't jump around every 4 seconds, so you really get to see the performance in a way that feels like you're in a front row seat right there at Ronnie Scott's.I could write the set list for you here, but not only is it right here on the Amazon product page for you already, would you really know any of the songs by their titles? I mean a devoted Beck fan probably would, but I've never even heard any of these compositions until I saw them on the DVD. I will say that there are 5 songs with guest performers: one with Joss Stone; two with Imogen Heap; and two with Eric Clapton. Now you might think, ""Clapton! Holy Moly...what a show stopper!"" But that would be completely incorrect. I'd even endanger a No-Vote to this review by going as far to say that the guest performances are skipable compared to what Beck's band does on its own for 16 of the total 21 songs on this DVD. But please don't skip the guest performances; they are definitely worth a viewing...at least the first time you watch the show.In the Extras on the Blu Ray version you also get a Rockabilly set with Beck and the Big Town Playboys. I was able to watch one or two songs in this performance before I quickly shut it off so as not to ruin the amazing impression that I was left with from the main performance. Rockabilly is not my thing.Any Rock fan will enjoy this disk immensely. Any Jazz fan will enjoy this disk immensely. Any music fan is making an immense mistake by passing on this disk.

The sounds this guy coaxes out of his guitar...amazing.  A virtual greatest hits package!  And yet, Beck was apparently smart enough to intersperse the set with a few guest musicians to break whatever 'monotomy' might have been creeping in with the audience  ( if that were possible with this line-up ).  Speaking of which, WHERE oh WHERE did he find Tal Wilkenfeld?  She is incredible on bass.  She's actually in her early twenties here, but comes across as a teenager just delighted to be sharing the same stage with Beck and Colaiuta.  And she holds her own extremely well!  I just wish her bass was a bit hotter in the mix.  My other complaint was with their treatment of ""Scatterbrain""...they jump into it with guns blazing, at breakneck speed.  It would have been sweet to have begun it slowly, gradually building to the frenzied climax...there's a nice 4/4 'oasis' in the middle, laid back and featuring the wonderful Jason on keyboards, and then it's full throttle back into the furious ending. That's just a matter of personal taste, of course; everthing on this set is subject to interpretation.  As to the guest musicians, Beck is comfortable enough and secure in his ability on guitar to invite no less than the legendary Eric Clapton up for two numbers.  And you simply cannot compare these two virtuosos:  if Beck has the 'edge' for technical ability on guitar--again, highly subjective!--Clapton brings an added dimension with his superb vocals.  For those not caring for the vocal tracks, the companion CD omits them.  This one runs the age gamut:  from the youthful Tal and Jason, to the fifty-plus Vinnie Colaiuta on drums ( monster! ) and sixtyish Beck himself.
