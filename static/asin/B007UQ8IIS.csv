1538152,A3EGA1CW9GLKJ4,B007UQ8IIS,"Brent R. Swanson ""coffee shop inspector""","[0, 0]","The plot is nearly as old as humankind: a man meets a magical being and is granted three wishes. In this case, the man is an addlepated night clerk (Dominique Abel) and the magical being is a lanky, eccentric redhead (Fiona Gordon) who claims to be a fairy. Since she can bring stalled elevators to life and make people fly, it's reasonable to assume that she is what she claims to be. After granting the clerk two wishes and giving him the wildest night of his life under the sea, she disappears and he must find her.This comedy has been likened to the movies of Keaton and Tati; Dominique Abel's performance (and appearance) recall Roberto Benigni. But this comedy exists in a world of its own, recalling not so much the realm of Keaton as it does the much fantastic world of Melies. If it lacks the French magician's spectacular effects, it retains just enough ambience of the incredible to enable us to embrace the fantasy rather than be concerned about endangerment.Abel and Gordon have wonderful comedic chemistry. Neither has ""conventional beauty,"" but possess eccentric charm and athletic physiques that lend themselves to physical comedy and pantomime. The supporting cast is equally wonderful, a collection of eccentrics worthy of a Fellini movie.Those who are put-off by subtitles have little to fear in this movie; it's practically a silent film, peppered with vintage music and just enough dialogue to move the plot along. There's a bit a rear-view nudity and a surreal dance scene laced with sexuality, but it's all in keeping with the lunacy of the love story.The extras on this dvd aren't much, but the feature compensates for that.",5,A Whirl of Whimsy,1355875200,"12 19, 2012",2012,1648,"['plot', 'nearly', 'as', 'old', 'humankind', 'man', 'magical', 'being', 'granted', 'three', 'wishes', 'case', 'man', 'addlepated', 'night', 'clerk', 'Dominique', 'Abel', 'magical', 'being', 'lanky', 'eccentric', 'redhead', 'Fiona', 'Gordon', 'who', 'be', 'fairy', 'can', 'bring', 'stalled', 'elevators', 'life', 'make', 'people', 'fly', 'reasonable', 'assume', 'what', 'be', 'granting', 'clerk', 'two', 'wishes', 'giving', 'wildest', 'night', 'life', 'sea', 'must', 'find', 'her.This', 'comedy', 'been', 'likened', 'movies', 'Keaton', 'Tati', 'Dominique', 'Abel', 'performance', 'appearance', 'recall', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'comedy', 'world', 'own', 'recalling', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'realm', 'Keaton', 'much', 'fantastic', 'world', 'Melies', 'French', 'magician', 'spectacular', 'effects', 'just', 'enough', 'ambience', 'incredible', 'enable', 'embrace', 'fantasy', 'rather', 'be', 'concerned', 'endangerment.Abel', 'Gordon', 'have', 'wonderful', 'comedic', 'chemistry', 'conventional', 'beauty', 'possess', 'eccentric', 'charm', 'athletic', 'physiques', 'lend', 'physical', 'comedy', 'pantomime', 'supporting', 'cast', 'equally', 'wonderful', 'collection', 'eccentrics', 'worthy', 'Fellini', 'movie.Those', 'who', 'are', 'put-off', 'subtitles', 'have', 'little', 'fear', 'movie', 'practically', 'silent', 'film', 'peppered', 'vintage', 'music', 'just', 'enough', 'dialogue', 'move', 'plot', 'bit', 'rear-view', 'nudity', 'surreal', 'dance', 'scene', 'laced', 'sexuality', 'keeping', 'lunacy', 'love', 'story.The', 'extras', 'dvd', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'feature']",N/A

1538156,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B007UQ8IIS,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","The trio of Dominique Abel, Fiona Gordon and Bruno Romy are known for their physical and absurdist comedies ""L'iceberg"" (2005) and ""Rumba"" (2008).Beloved by many for incorporating a semi-silent style of filmmaking, focusing on physical comedy reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and also Jacques Tati, the trio once again came together to write, direct and star in the French/Belgian comedy,""The Fairy"" (La f&eacute;e).And received positive reviews from film critics for its crazy humor and physical comedy and now the film was released in America on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Kino Lorber.VIDEO:""The Fairy"" is presented in 1080p high Definition (1:85:1 aspect ratio).  The cinematography by Clair Childeric is beautiful and she manages to capture the look and feel of the industrial port city of Le Havre.  Vibrant and colorful with natural skin tones to black levels that are nice and deep, overall picture quality is very good for ""The Fairy"".  Granted, there are some scenes where ""fake"" backgrounds are shown via green screen, the scenes were intentional.But overall, there is nothing I can say badly about the video quality of ""The Fairy"".  The film looks beautiful on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Fairy"" is presented in French DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  The film is primarily physical, with some dialogue and music, so as expected, it was front and center channel heavy. But overall audio, dialogue and music is crystal clear.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES""The Fairy"" comes with a theatrical trailer and stills gallery.JUDGMENT CALL:When I watched the film ""Rumba"" was surprised but also captivated by the performance by Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon.There films are so far from traditional French or Hollywood cinema in the fact that these two leading talents are so unlike the image of what one would see as romantic comedy film stars but the fact that these two along with Bruno Romy have managed to create three films that are odd, crazy but yet, these absurdist comedies are too fun to ignore.The physical comedy by both Abel and Gordon are reminders of the days of Chaplin and Keaton but also the whimsical style of Jacques Tati, but in a more goofier and crazy way.  They are the most unlikely people to see in the film, but its that charm of being so against what is traditional in cinema that adds to ""The Fairy's"" allure.Watching ""The Fairy"" is like having the goofiest dream that you ever had and making it into a movie.  For example, in one scene, a nude Dom and Fiona run into the beach and end up sinking into the ocean with nothing but seaweed on them, but yet, similar to their film ""Rumba"", the two take part in a dance.In another scene, we see the skinny Fiona's stomach, suddenly ballooning to show that she is pregnant.  But in crazy fashion, when she gives birth, we see what looks like a six month old baby with its umbilical cord come out of her.  And together, these two odd individuals must be parents to this baby that they named ""Jimmy"".You add in other odd characters such as the slimy John (Philippe Martz), who is doing something naughty in his bedroom, but why he needs his dog so much, is it for companionship or something else?  Hmm...You also have Bruno Romy playing an owner of a pub.  But he is so blind that he can't even see what he is serving and the fact that people go into this pub and seeing this man who can barely see is quite absurd.  But so damn funny!  I couldn't help but laugh, because it was so out of left field.Throw in three Black men, who are homeless but yet find themselves in the oddest positions that related to Dom, Fiona and John.  In one scene, they want to go to England, so they jump into an old vehicle in hopes that John can illegally take them there.But there are so many odd moments in this film that you will find yourself laughing but also thinking, ""I can't believe they did that!"".Usually, whenever a baby is seen in a film, we often see the parents caring for it.  In ""The Fairy"", little Jimmy is falling from a building, falling off a cliff, accidentally placed on the trunk of a moving car and suffice to say, this baby is going through the craziest experiences!Granted, I'm sure there are parents who will complain about a baby being used in this way but hopefully no one is too much of a troglodyte to think that baby's can be treated in such a manner.But its the absurdity of ""The Fairy"" that makes it so fun to watch and once in a while, it's great to have something that is crazy and clever, rather than the abundant of films that are crazy, banal and kitsch.As for the Blu-ray, picture quality is gorgeous. The cinematography of Claire Childreic manages to capture the feel and surroundings of Le Havre.  Skin tones are natural, detail is very good in HD, including closeups and audio, presented in French DTS-HD MA 5.1 is crystal clear.  Although, it is primarily front and center channel driven.  As for special features, as much as I would have loved a commentary track or featurette, the theatrical trailer and stills gallery is included.Overall, ""The Fairy"" is one of the craziest, goofiest and absurd film that I have seen all year, and have seen in quite a while.  But it's a film that I also enjoyed tremendously because it is so different and so unusual from the comedy films that we are used to seeing today.  From the beautifully choreographed dancing, the outrageous physical comedy and its zany storyline, ""The Fairy"" is a film that I definitely recommend!",4,"""The Fairy"" is one of the craziest,

Dom is a sad sack who works as the night manager in a small hotel. We first meet him as he's bicycling to work, in the rain, on a bike that keeps throwing its chain. His life is one of small pleasure- a few undisturbed minutes during which he can enjoy his sandwich and an old movie. But such moments are hard to come by, as he finds himself repeatedly interrupted by curious travelers and an odd woman who appears at the door without any luggage, announces that she is a fairy, and grants him three wishes. Fiona- that's the fairy's name- doesn't look like anyone's conception of a fairy- but Dom is startled to discover his first two wishes come true, and that's when things start to get even stranger.But to say things get strange is an understatement. The plot is really just a tenuous thread that ties together moments of comedy, dance, and music. The team of Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon, who both wrote and star in The Fairy, are dancers, mimes, and performers who have collaborated for many years, both personally and artistically, and this film showcases both their wit and originality and their great physical skill- though in a way unlike anything you may have seen before. Like all great comedies, The Fairy is completely original, with characters and a plot that is like nothing you've ever seen in a movie, and that means that every scene, every turn of events is completely unexpected.

Fiona (in the role of Fiona) and Dom (in the role of Dom) have a wonderful, quirky chemistry, though. Her odd ways of making wishes come true, her penchant for shopping without the bother of payment, and his chronic lack of ambition play off each other nicely, with occasional caroms off the enjoyable supporting characters.A few surreal moments pop in, like the two dance numbers (one underwater, the other with her rotundly pregnant) give plenty to laugh at, as do the moments and characters in the psych ward.
