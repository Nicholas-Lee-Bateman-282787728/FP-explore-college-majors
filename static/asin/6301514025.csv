254498,A9998RE3AEA95,6301514025,Alex,"[5, 9]","""Charly"" is unfairly dramatized. Now, I undestand that the original is subtle and challenging stuff to film, but excuses do not make a good movie. When I go to see a film version of Keyes' masterpiece ""Flowers for Algernon,"" I'm not really expecting a ludicrous romance armed with several barbs directed at intellectualism and pop-culture.""Flowers for Algernon"" was about a mentally challenged man's exponential mental development after a surgical procedure, followed by his tragic decline. ""Charly"" is about a mentally challenged man's transformation into a suit-and-tie kinda guy, at which point his libido awakens and he strikes up an absurd relationship with his tutor. Then we get a minute's worth of footage of Charly growing forgetful and irritable, and then - bam! - he is again frolicking around with an IQ of 68, happy as a clam. Not only does this film provide us with a happy ending - it's the WRONG happy ending: read the book and you'll find a much better one at the end.Of course, ""Charly"" isn't entirely bad. It just seems that way. Cliff Robertson's outstanding performance as the title character buoys the score a little. It also allow him to keep a straight face during an unintentionally comical scene in which a panel of scientists ask him existential questions and he gives snappy answers (""Standard of living?"" ""A TV in every room."" ""Education?"" ""A TV IN EVERY ROOM!"") The scenes in which Charly goes through biker and disco dancer phases are also hilarious.Seriously, though, the entire film creates an impression of wrongness and inappropriacy. Charly acts in realistic, sufficiently childlike ways, but the viewer never gains insight into his inner workings. The film is a character study narrated by minor and totally undeveloped characters. ""Charly"" also suffers from exceptional heavy-handedness. The scene is which Charly gropes Ms. Kinnian and she scrambles away from him, screaming ""who could want you, you stupid moron!?"" is a prime example. Another is his relationship with his co-workers. In the book they just joked about him. Here, they are genuinely malicious.People who've read the literary work before seeing the film based on it are usually biased against the film. I am definitely a part of that crowd, so your opinion may be vastly different from mine.

It also brings out the feeling of ""what the hell?"" moment for me, especially with the motorcycle scenes. In other words, Charly is a ridiculous adaption of the novel Flowers for Algernon because, quite so, it is nothing like the book. There is no real depth about the film; just a lot of pensive thinking, but the audience has no clue what are his thoughts. There is no analysis whatsoever either. Of course, Cliff Robertson has to win the Oscar because he hits the gold standard: a mentally retarded character. Honestly, his performance is nothing special. In fact, I find his portrayal of a mentally retarded adult to be completely unrealistic, and he seems to be far advanced for his IQ in terms of his speaking skills compared to what I normally expect from his peers. The transformation of Claire Bloom's character from a serious professional with ethics to a love-dovey worshiper has my head shaking left to right. That brings up the second highlight of the show: her asking Charly to marry her despite the fact that she knows that he will be back to his mentally retarded self!

If you've never read the book, I do high recommend that you pickup a copy from the library.A mildly mentally retarded man submits to a scientific experiment to increase his intelligence. Like ""Frankenstein"", ""Charly"" is a clever morality play about science that crosses certain boundaries. Unlike ""Frankenstein"", which took the horror route, ""Charly"" explores the emotional human tragedy that inevitably occurs when an experiment of this nature goes awry.Many scientists back then and even today argue that the professional boundaries that were crossed in this story would never happen in real life. Yet with the recent successful gene manipulation and cloning experiments many believe it is only a matter of time, a very short time, before a human submits to such experiments.What I got most from this film is not a clinical study of mental retardation but the way society deals with mental retardation, and in this the film soars, and it will bring a tear or two if you have even a bit of humanity. It is a wonderful film, on many levels, testing us all on how we deal with those who are so unfortunate as to be mentally handicapped.The one funny thing about movies made in the 60s are the psychedelic visual effects...some of them were way out to lunch.",3,Stick with the book,1167091200,"12 26, 2006",2006,1343,"['read', 'Flowers', 'Algernon', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'so', 'had', 'pretty', 'much', 'forgotten', 'story', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'book', 'do', 'high', 'recommend', 'pickup', 'copy', 'library.A', 'mildly', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'man', 'scientific', 'experiment', 'increase', 'intelligence', 'Frankenstein', 'Charly', 'clever', 'morality', 'play', 'science', 'certain', 'boundaries', 'Frankenstein', 'took', 'horror', 'route', 'Charly', 'emotional', 'human', 'tragedy', 'inevitably', 'when', 'experiment', 'nature', 'awry.Many', 'scientists', 'back', 'then', 'even', 'today', 'argue', 'professional', 'boundaries', 'were', 'crossed', 'story', 'would', 'never', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'recent', 'successful', 'gene', 'manipulation', 'cloning', 'experiments', 'many', 'believe', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'very', 'short', 'time', 'human', 'submits', 'such', 'got', 'most', 'film', 'not', 'clinical', 'study', 'mental', 'retardation', 'way', 'society', 'deals', 'mental', 'retardation', 'film', 'soars', 'will', 'bring', 'tear', 'two', 'have', 'even', 'bit', 'humanity', 'wonderful', 'film', 'many', 'levels', 'testing', 'how', 'deal', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'unfortunate', 'be', 'mentally', 'handicapped.The', 'one', 'funny', 'thing', 'movies', 'made', '60s', 'are', 'psychedelic', 'visual', 'effects', 'were', 'way', 'lunch']",Charly VHS

254503,A1NFKE0TNZUGGC,6301514025,"Benito Vasquez ""Benji""","[1, 1]","Unliike many reviewers, I saw this movie when first released before I read the book. Like many movies of its period this one has a distinct 60s flavor to it in many respects. Like movies from the 70s, many of the production qualities of this movie's time seem incredibly dated. But hindsight can put that kind of stamp on any time period (anyone ever watched an episode of ""Miami Vice"" in hindsight with a straight face?). So just when one saw ""Charly"" for the first time makes all the difference, as does which they did first- read the book or saw the movie. The impact it had on me when I first saw it was tremendous. I wanted to see it again but before that occurred I read the book. I probably enjoyed the book much more as a result. I agree that the two have dramatic differences, but that has always been the risk when adapting a movie from the book. Robertson gives a solid, award winnng performance that evokes pathos, though today it seems a bit over the top. The direction and camera work are reflective of the late 60s, which unwittingly seems to make this movie that much more of a time capsule, almost worth watching for that reason alone- almost! But that detracts from the film at hand. One could argue that if this movie was produced in a different decade it might still bear trademarks indigenousness to that time and place. When younger I demanded films that suited my taste buds of the age I was at that time. Since then, over the years I've watched lots of movies from different time periods that I either hadn't seen before, or now viewed differently. But generally that didn't take away from the appreciation originally instilled in me for a movie. I still find many scenes in this movie heartbreaking, particularly the sequence in which intelligent Charlie can't escape the vision of what inevitably awaits him once the experiment wears off. Just how that was accomplished by the film is irrelevant. Some movies demand remakes. Others are remade merely to add contemporary flavor in some shape or form and should never have been remade. In between those two there is a wide gap of grey, which is where I feel this movie falls. There are numerous films that don't find a contemporary audience due to the time it was released. I still know many who either haven't seen ""Rosemary's Baby"" or couldn't make it through it because they could taste the 60s while watching it. But that doesn't mean it wasn't a great film. Not to compare the two films directly, but it can be argued that ""Charlie"" suffers in the same manner. Though great movies withstand the test of time, to me, how much you enjoy ""Charly"" is purely subjective.

Despite his handicap he tries to better himself by attending night school where he is tutored by Mrs. Kinian played Claire Bloom.Bloom playing a Phd. psychology candidate nominates Charly for a revolutionary experiment conducted by neuroscientists Drs. Straus and Nemur played respectively by Lilia Skala and Leon Janney.  They had amazing success implanting brain tissue into a white mouse named Algernon significantly increasing his intelligence.  They were now ready to attempt this procedure on a human subject and Charly was to be their guinea pig.With Bloom as his teacher, Robertson's mental capabilities grew to genius level as he began digesting quantum amounts of information.  His emotional development however did not grow at the same pace.  Eventually he and Bloom fell in love, as his amazing tranformation is about to be demonstrated before the scientific community.  At the conference, Robertson learns that the results of the operation are only temporary and he desperately tries to use his new found intelligence to prevent his life from reverting back.Robertson, a surprise Oscar winner in 1969 gave a poignant portrayal of Charly Gordon, a lonely retarded adult who learned that an increase of intelligence and awareness didn't necessarily translate into a happier existence.",4,A dispiriting scientific breakthrough,1197504000,"12 13, 2007",2007,1650,"['hopelessly', 'dated', 'film', 'Charly', 'product', 'psychedelic', '60', 'based', 'book', 'Flowers', 'Algernon', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'adult', 'Charly', 'Gordon', 'played', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Charly', 'lonely', 'solitary', 'existence', 'working', 'laborer', 'bakery', 'often', 'brunt', 'practical', 'jokes', 'hand', 'more', 'cerebral', 'colleagues', 'handicap', 'better', 'attending', 'night', 'school', 'where', 'tutored', 'Mrs.', 'Kinian', 'played', 'Claire', 'Bloom.Bloom', 'playing', 'Phd', 'psychology', 'candidate', 'nominates', 'Charly', 'revolutionary', 'experiment', 'conducted', 'neuroscientists', 'Drs', 'Straus', 'Nemur', 'played', 'respectively', 'Lilia', 'Skala', 'Leon', 'Janney', 'had', 'amazing', 'success', 'implanting', 'brain', 'tissue', 'white', 'mouse', 'named', 'Algernon', 'significantly', 'increasing', 'intelligence', 'were', 'now', 'ready', 'attempt', 'procedure', 'human', 'subject', 'Charly', 'was', 'be', 'guinea', 'pig.With', 'Bloom', 'teacher', 'Robertson', 'mental', 'capabilities', 'grew', 'genius', 'level', 'began', 'digesting', 'quantum', 'amounts', 'information', 'emotional', 'development', 'however', 'did', 'not', 'grow', 'same', 'pace', 'Eventually', 'Bloom', 'fell', 'love', 'amazing', 'tranformation', 'be', 'demonstrated', 'scientific', 'community', 'conference', 'Robertson', 'results', 'operation', 'are', 'only', 'temporary', 'desperately', 'use', 'new', 'found', 'intelligence', 'prevent', 'life', 'reverting', 'back.Robertson', 'surprise', 'Oscar', 'winner', '1969', 'gave', 'poignant', 'portrayal', 'Charly', 'Gordon', 'lonely', 'retarded', 'adult', 'who', 'learned', 'increase', 'intelligence', 'awareness', 'did', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'translate', 'happier', 'existence']",Charly VHS

This was probably the intent of the director to make the movie more accessible to large audiences, and is evident in that he changed the title of the book to ""Charly"" for the movie. Some of the more blatant directoral liberties include:- The relationship between Charlie and Miss Kinnian is depicted as rather wilde and tawdry in the film (with several semi-explicit scenes), where as in the book, Charlie simply develops a romantic fixation on her that is never consumated. Although the director probably felt the need to incorporate a love interest in the movie to keep viewers watching, it seemed rather unnecessary and the low-key approach of the book might have actually been more interesting.- Dr. Strauss and Dr. Nemur are a female and a male neurologist respectively in the movie, where as in the novel both are men. While seemingly a minor discrepancy, the book implied that there was a clashing of male egos, especially as the novel showcased Dr. Nemur as feeling pressure and jealousy so as to get more credit for the experiment than Dr. Strauss, a younger man with certain fundamental differences of opinion regarding the whole procedure.- In the movie Charlie briefly joins -- in an utterly preposterous scene -- a motorcycle gang and engages in an orgy with the female bikers, as solace for his rejection by Miss Kinnian. While this was entertaining on an ""oh my, this really is so dumb it's fascinating and fun to watch"" level, nothing of the sort occurred in the book, and there are probably better ways to show Charlie's difficulty in adjusting to life as an intellectual genius albeit with the hormonal instability of a sixteen year old.While ""Charly"" is still an enjoyable movie, it is a bit boring if you haven't read the book first, and, considering the superior quality of the book's story, the movie seems actually worse than it really is.",3,"Interesting example of 1960s camp/kitcsch, however it makes severe departures from the book!",1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,2384,"['Charly', 'relatively', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'Daniel', 'Keyes', 'critically-acclaimed', 'novella', 'Flowers', 'Algernon', '1968', 'movie', 'much', 'decade', 'tendency', 'psychadellic', 'beatnik', 'however', 'doing', 'several', 'perhaps', 'fatal', 'departures', 'book.I', 'say', 'fatal', 'not', 'sense', 'movie', 'terrible', 'movie', 'quite', 'good', 'slow', 'places', 'fatal', 'sense', 'important', 'fundamental', 'elements', 'present', 'book', 'are', 'missing', 'movie', 'version', 'was', 'probably', 'intent', 'director', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'accessible', 'large', 'audiences', 'evident', 'changed', 'title', 'book', 'Charly', 'movie', 'more', 'blatant', 'directoral', 'liberties', 'include', 'relationship', 'Charlie', 'Miss', 'Kinnian', 'depicted', 'rather', 'wilde', 'tawdry', 'film', 'several', 'semi-explicit', 'scenes', 'where', 'book', 'Charlie', 'simply', 'romantic', 'fixation', 'never', 'consumated', 'director', 'probably', 'felt', 'need', 'incorporate', 'love', 'interest', 'movie', 'keep', 'viewers', 'watching', 'seemed', 'rather', 'unnecessary', 'low-key', 'approach', 'book', 'might', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'more', 'interesting.-', 'Dr.', 'Strauss', 'Dr.', 'Nemur', 'are', 'female', 'male', 'neurologist', 'respectively', 'movie', 'where', 'novel', 'are', 'men', 'seemingly', 'minor', 'discrepancy', 'book', 'implied', 'was', 'clashing', 'male', 'egos', 'especially', 'novel', 'showcased', 'Dr.', 'Nemur', 'feeling', 'pressure', 'jealousy', 'so', 'get', 'more', 'credit', 'experiment', 'Dr.', 'Strauss', 'younger', 'man', 'certain', 'fundamental', 'differences', 'opinion', 'regarding', 'whole', 'procedure.-', 'movie', 'Charlie', 'briefly', 'joins', 'utterly', 'preposterous', 'scene', 'motorcycle', 'gang', 'orgy', 'female', 'bikers', 'solace', 'rejection', 'Miss', 'Kinnian', 'was', 'entertaining', 'oh', 'really', 'so', 'dumb', 'fascinating', 'fun', 'watch', 'level', 'nothing', 'sort', 'occurred', 'book', 'are', 'probably', 'better', 'ways', 'show', 'Charlie', 'difficulty', 'adjusting', 'life', 'intellectual', 'genius', 'hormonal', 'instability', 'sixteen', 'year', 'Charly', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'bit', 'boring', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'first', 'considering', 'superior', 'quality', 'book', 'story', 'movie', 'actually', 'worse', 'really']",Charly VHS

The story was about Charly Gordon, a man who, in the parlance of the time, was mentally retarded.  As part of a scientific experiment he is given a drug that turns him into a genius.  The Algernon of the title is a lab rat who was the first guinea pig for this treatment.  However, the treatment proves to be only temporary.  Both versions of Keyes's story were done as diary entries, which provided a graphic indication of how Charly is changing.The 1968 movie version, of course, opens up the story and gets away from the first-person perspective that made ""Flowers for Algernon"" so compelling.  To add insult to injury, there is now a romance between Charly with a character named Alice Kinian (Claire Bloom).  Of course, this changes the whole dynamic of the film, at the cost of the poignancy of Charly's relationship with Algernon.  As the title character Cliff Robertson won the Oscar and clearly the problem is not with his performance but rather with Stirling Silliphant's screenplay.  Still, to be fair, any film adaptation of the fragile original story was going to lose what made it so great.Consequently, this is one of those films that you will enjoy more if you have not read ""Flowers for Algernon.""

This is not to say that Cliff Robertson's performance in the title role of Charly Gordon, a gentle, mentally challenged person, is not Oscar worthy. It is, and he deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Charly Gordon. Claire Bloom is also noteworthy for her performance as Charly's teacher and love interest, Alice Kinian. The problem with this film lies in the screenplay and direction of the film.The storyline is simple enough. Charly Gordon, a gentle, mentally challenged soul with a thirst for knowledge, attends night school in an effort to get smart. His teacher is Alice Kinian, a sensitive and caring person, who recognizes Charly's determination, as well as his limitations. She takes an interest in him and refers him to an institute that has been doing research in increasing the intelligence of laboratory mice through neurosurgery and is now on the cusp of attempting that experimental neurosurgery on humans. The institute is in the process of selecting candidates for its clinical trials.Charly goes to the institute where he undergoes a battery of tests and has his capability for problem solving compared to that of a laboratory mouse named Algernon, whose intelligence has been surgically enhanced. After much deliberation, the institute decides to take Charly on as a human guinea pig, after Ms. Kinian eloquently persuades them that Charly's determination and sweet disposition should overcome the fact that he is below the threshold level of intelligence that they were looking for in a human subject.Charly undergoes neurosurgery, which initially appears to be a success. He gets smart, very smart. The inevitable romance with Ms. Kinian follows, as Charly exceeds all expectations. It is here that the film begins to fall apart and takes a swan dive. In an effort to show the changes in Charly's life, the film shows a collage of stills and scenes of Charly and Ms. Kinian that are ludicrous and almost embarrassing. They are presented in a fashion that is best described as psychedelic. It is done so poorly, as to make the film lose credibility, and it is downhill from there on, as the story becomes one dimensional. The screenplay writer and director should have stuck to the book, both in story and in theme, remembering that you can't fix what ain't broke.Still, Cliff Robertson's performance, as well as that of Claire Bloom, is worth watching.

It makes a good book-end to ""Colossus: The Forbin Project"" and ""The Andromeda Strain"", and it asks if ethical/moral/social responsibility can keep pace with technology (this is something to think about, now that scientists are busy patenting our genes for their own commercial gain).Daniel Keyes original short story was evolved into a teleplay, then a novel (1966) and then this feature (1968).  Keyes had several years and many drafts to get the book right.  Nelson and team are not quite as fortunate, but still do an excellent job. Yes, it does on occasion belabor the point, but there are also moments of brilliance:  when the newly developed super-intelligent Charly makes his appearance before a auditorium of scientists (""a television in every room"") it is both funny and prophetic (and I believe this to be intentional); in one exceptional scene he tells us our destinies (with remarkable accuracy), and sees his own tragedy.  He has become a performing mouse, like Algernon running the maze.  And his performance won't last for long.Some complain about the Biker/Disco/Hippy/Sex and Drugs montage.  Yes, a tad dated.  But Charly is a second grader suddenly thrown into adulthood; he has no way of coping normally so he does the best he can. These sequences might not always work, but they don't fail. They don't hurt the film, they just don't help it as well as they might.Ralph Nelson has always chosen his feature-films cleverly - he might be a little heavy-handed, but he knows the value of the material and he tries to be faithful to it.  Unlike our contemporary efforts (Powder, et al) where the townsfolk are ignorant and evil and the ""oddity"" is a saint, ""Charly"" (and Nelson) at least pay lip-service to the moral and ethical ambiguities: is making a stupid man smart always a good thing? At least here there's something to think about.Cliff Robertson, Claire Bloom (she's hot) and the supporting cast all deliver first rate performances.  ""Charly"" was shot Techniscope (2.35) and uses some split-screen sequences that may not reproduce well on pan-and-scan VHS version.  Please let there be a DVD soon!Yes it has it's short-comings, but as a film (and even better as an SF film) ""Charly"" it s still the equal of Gattaca, Andromeda Strain, or Colossus.  In other words, definitely a must see.",4,Dated? Heavy Handed?  A Little.

Eventually made into this movie, I enjoyed it despite several points where the movie departs from the book and gets pretty hokey, when the director should have had the sense to stick with the original book. As has been mentioned before, the photo montage sequence of Charlie with Miss Kinian and Charlie's riding off on the motorcycle was almost embarrasingly bad (maybe they were recalling the movie, ""Then Came Bronson,"" from the same period). But overall Robertson's portrayal of Charlie was engaging and believable and the scene where he addresses the assembled scientists is certainly very memorable as a demonstration of his newly attained genius. ""Brave new loves, brave new hates,"" was how he summarized the coming age, a quote which turned out to be more prescient than anyone could have imagined. The movie in many ways epitomizes the 60s fascination with personal transformation through chemical means, and if only genius were so easily attainable as taking a drug.

Village of the Damned. Nightfall. In the Heat of the Night. Telefon. The Towering Inferno. But, like most screenwriters, every once in a while, he got it wrong. The Poseidon Adventure. The Swarm. Over the Top. Yes, Over the Top, the infamous Sylvester Stallone arm wrestling movie. That was him. Where Charly falls onto this line probably depends on how you feel about the novel.Loosely based on Daniel Keyes' classic Flowers for Algernon, Charly is the story of Charlie Gordon, a mentally retarded man who undergoes an experimental brain operation that makes him smart, and the trials and tribulations that come from getting everything you wish for. I tried to look at Charly as being an entirely separate beast from the novel, but I'm not sure that's the way to go with this one. Whether I look at it in comparison or not, the movie still suffers.Compared to the novel, the difference is that Charlie Gordon (Cliff Robertson, who won a Best Actor Oscar for his performance) himself is an emasculated character, a passive observer of events, where the novel's Charlie was active, a participant in things. Many of the novel's subplots that made Charlie into a man of action have been removed; he's no longer the inquisitive scientist who discovers the seeds of his own downfall, but someone who's asked to help stop that downfall after it's revealed to him. His parents are gone; the complex relationship he has with his teacher Alice (here played by The Haunting's Claire Bloom) is turned into a simple, if slightly confusing, love story. (Confusing because there's a fiance mentioned who pops up nowhere in the book; he disappears again as soon as it's convenient, getting no actual screen time.) I understand that even a slim novel has to be trimmed to fit into movie form, but other things were added that brought nothing of comparable (or measurable) value to the table. Which leads me to the other option.Taken on its own, it's an intriguing beginning that goes horribly, horribly wrong about two-thirds of the way through, when it stops being a story about a guy in an interesting situation and becomes a one-dimensional piece of political screed barely worthy of existence. (I kept thinking about Slaughterhouse-Five during the awful Q&A; scene.) It does improve again after that, but that scene, sitting in the conceptual center of the film with no anchor, and indeed no reason for being there (it's a pivotal scene in the novel, though it plays out in a much different manner), is claptrap of the most nauseating kind.I know part of my reaction to the movie is my own fault. I usually stick to my rule about not seeing a film adaptation until at least a year after I read the associated book. That said, Flowers for Algernon was such an amazing book, I wanted to see the movie ASAP. Well, the saying ""the bigger they are..."" applies here, most definitely. It wouldn't be an awful film, without the inclusion of that one horribly offensive scene.

After we both watched it - her for the second time, me for the first time - I had to ask her if it wasn't Flowers for Algernon she remembered. She was disappointed seeing it again, and I was not impressed either. I started losing interest when Charly began ogling his teacher, and they lost me entirely when he assaulted her. Why'd they have to put that whole bit in? I mean, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that a mentally retarded person would still be fully developed physically. I think that whole sex craze was added just for the sensational effect, a reflection of the time in which it was made. I watched this version instead of Flowers for Algernon because I didn't want to see something too kidified, but now I'm sorry I got this one instead.

254537,A3S43PKPN63CW4,6301514025,Terry Teays,"[2, 3]","The principal strength of this movie is the acting by Cliff Robertson.  This was an exceptionally challenging role, that required a real breadth of acting style to portray the changes that the protagonist went through.  The oscar was well deserved.  The story moves along well and you feel the pathos of the two main characters.  Some of the minor characters are very one-dimensional and not well acted to boot.  The movie shows some of the influences of the late sixties when it was produced, but many of the underlying issues such as treatment of the mentally challenged and medical experimentation are still quite current.The book on which the movie is based, Flowers for Algernon, is a true classic of science fiction and a really memorable book.  The movie scriptwriters chose to focus on the relationship between Charlie Gordon and his teacher, and spent less time on the nature of Charlie's intellectual development and what it meant to his life.  The book is actually based on an earlier novella that Daniel Keyes wrote that won the Hugo Award.  I have always felt that the expansion into novel length did not add anything to the story development and in fact blunted the powerful effect of the novella's roller coaster ride.In short, I would recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it.  I would recommend the book even more strongly.",4,"Decent movie, great performance by Cliff Robertson",1152057600,"07 5, 2006",2006,1349,"['principal', 'strength', 'movie', 'acting', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'was', 'exceptionally', 'challenging', 'role', 'required', 'real', 'breadth', 'acting', 'style', 'portray', 'changes', 'protagonist', 'went', 'oscar', 'was', 'well', 'deserved', 'story', 'moves', 'along', 'well', 'feel', 'pathos', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'one-dimensional', 'not', 'well', 'acted', 'boot', 'movie', 'influences', 'late', 'sixties', 'when', 'was', 'produced', 'many', 'underlying', 'issues', 'such', 'treatment', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'medical', 'experimentation', 'are', 'still', 'quite', 'current.The', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'Flowers', 'Algernon', 'true', 'classic', 'science', 'fiction', 'really', 'memorable', 'book', 'movie', 'scriptwriters', 'chose', 'focus', 'relationship', 'Charlie', 'Gordon', 'teacher', 'spent', 'less', 'time', 'nature', 'Charlie', 'intellectual', 'development', 'what', 'meant', 'life', 'book', 'actually', 'based', 'earlier', 'novella', 'Daniel', 'Keyes', 'wrote', 'won', 'Hugo', 'Award', 'have', 'always', 'felt', 'expansion', 'novel', 'length', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'anything', 'story', 'development', 'fact', 'blunted', 'powerful', 'effect', 'novella', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride.In', 'short', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'would', 'recommend', 'book', 'even', 'more', 'strongly']",Charly VHS
254538,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,6301514025,T O'Brien,"[1, 1]","Charly is a very moving movie from 1968 that gave star Cliff Robertson his first and only Oscar win, a well deserved nomination at that.  Charly Gordon is a mentally disabled man with an IQ of 70.  He lives in a single room that he rents with basically nothing more than a bed, a table, and a chalkboard where he writes his things to do for the next day. Charly works at a bakery where the people he thinks are his friends, his co-workers, always make fun of him and play practical jokes.  But he doesn't let much stop him, going to night school everyday for 2 years to learn to read and write.  Then, a doctor with a new procedure comes along and offers Charly the chance to become smart.  Charly undergoes the procedure and almost overnight becomes a new man, in just a few weeks he is a genius.  But everything is not quite what it seems as Charly begins to experience life all over again and see what the world is really like.  This was a very powerful movie from beginning to end. It could almost be divided into two separate movies and still been very good.  As a viewer, you come to really know Charly, which makes the ending, especially the final shot, that much more moving.  Definitely give this movie a try.In the performance that won him his lone Academy Award, Cliff Robertson stars as Charly Gordon, the mentally disabled middle aged man who has his life change drastically in the matter of days.  Robertson is really playing two roles here, pre-surgery Charly and post-surgery Charly.  Always a very strong actor throughout his career, Robertson pulls off both parts beautifully and really makes you feel with and for the character.  Claire Bloom plays Alice Kinian, Charly's teacher who becomes much more than his teacher as Charly goes through the transformation following the surgery.  Bloom is very good next to Robertson.  Lilia Skala plays Dr. Anna Straus, one of the doctors who works with Charly and ultimately, has his best interest at heart.  Leon Janney plays Straus' opposite, Dr. Richard Nemur, who seems to only be interested in how famous he will become.  The movie also stars Ruth White, Dick Van Patten, Ed McNally, Barney Martin, William Dwyer, and Dan Morgan.It's too bad more couldn't have been done with this DVD release.  The disc has full screen and widescreen presentations of the movie, but nothing else.  Not even a trailer!  Maybe a Special Edition is out there with interviews with Robertson and Bloom.  No special features or not, this is an excellent movie and should not be missed, if for nothing else than to see Cliff Robertson's great performance as Charly Gordon.

Back in the 1950's and 1960's, in the days before dyslexia, ADHD, or Aspergers' Syndrome were understood, many of us were thought to be stupid or lazy while in elementary school--only to excel in high school and college where the curriculum demanded a degree of abstract and spatial thinking, rather than consisting entirely of the mundane clerical work that dominated elementary school.I first saw this movie in 1968, when I was a sophomore or junior in high school and found it to be shockingly surreal!  I still recall the feeling of shaking in my seat and breaking out into a cold sweat--its impact on me was that great!  So many of poor Charly's struggles seemed strangely parallel to my own.In ninth grade, I once even overheard one of my classmates wondering out loud how I had come to be a ""brain "" over the course of eighth and ninth grades!  I thought of this moment when Charly's coworkers at the bakery became uncomfortably aware that he was suddenly able to operate the complicated dough-kneading machine more expertly than any of them.",5,"In a odd way, a compelling film for those suffering from dyslexia, ADHD, or Asperger syndrome",1287360000,"10 18, 2010",2010,1294,"['do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'are', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'transformed', 'geniuses', 'advanced', 'medical', 'procedures', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'suffered', 'dyslexia', 'ADHD', 'child', 'movie', 'sympathetic', 'chord', 'Back', '1950', '1960', 'days', 'dyslexia', 'ADHD', 'Aspergers', 'Syndrome', 'were', 'understood', 'many', 'were', 'thought', 'be', 'stupid', 'lazy', 'elementary', 'school', 'only', 'excel', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'where', 'curriculum', 'demanded', 'degree', 'abstract', 'spatial', 'thinking', 'rather', 'consisting', 'entirely', 'mundane', 'clerical', 'work', 'dominated', 'elementary', 'school.I', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', '1968', 'when', 'was', 'sophomore', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'found', 'be', 'shockingly', 'surreal', 'still', 'recall', 'feeling', 'shaking', 'seat', 'breaking', 'out', 'cold', 'sweat', 'impact', 'was', 'great', 'So', 'many', 'poor', 'Charly', 'struggles', 'seemed', 'strangely', 'parallel', 'own.In', 'ninth', 'grade', 'once', 'even', 'overheard', 'one', 'classmates', 'wondering', 'out', 'loud', 'how', 'had', 'come', 'be', 'brain', 'course', 'eighth', 'ninth', 'grades', 'thought', 'moment', 'when', 'Charly', 'coworkers', 'bakery', 'became', 'uncomfortably', 'aware', 'was', 'suddenly', 'able', 'operate', 'complicated', 'dough-kneading', 'machine', 'more', 'expertly']",Charly VHS
