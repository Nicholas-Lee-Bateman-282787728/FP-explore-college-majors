It was funny and entertaining. The acting was brilliant and the plot offered enough suspense and surprises that it did not disappoint ! The only disappointment was that the series ended and never continued. I enjoyed it, would definitely purchase it again, and am hopefully that there will be follow up episodes.",4,A very good series that ended with out follow up,1355270400,"12 12, 2012",2012,456,"['was', 'excellent', 'short', 'series', 'was', 'disappointed', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'sort', 'left', 'hanging', 'wondering', 'where', 'would', 'go', 'next', 'was', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'acting', 'was', 'brilliant', 'plot', 'offered', 'enough', 'suspense', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'only', 'disappointment', 'was', 'series', 'ended', 'never', 'continued', 'enjoyed', 'would', 'definitely', 'purchase', 'again', 'am', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'follow', 'up', 'episodes']",Rake
1539119,A25DOGUB7OBDEN,B007W144RK,bugsplat,"[3, 3]","This series is comedic drama, and when it is comedic, it's rolling on the floor funny. Paul Cleaver Greene, played by Richard Roxburgh, is a barrister in the Australian Bar, with a boatload of personal problems that makes his life a tragi-comic juggling act of multiple crises in his life. Greene has 2 ex-wives, one a barrister, the other a private practice psychologist, whose teenage son, fathered by Cleaver, is in high school, with exploding hormones, and a penchant for getting involved with older women. He has a secretary who embezzles from him, ongoing tax problems with the government, in love with a hooker, and owes bookies hundreds of thousands of dollars. This still doesn't cover all of his problems. At times he has a cocaine addiction, imbibes alcohol too much, and runs his mouth at the most inopportune moments. He's on a first name basis with his bookies muscle, who dispenses the occasional  beating when Cleaver falls behind in his payments. This leads one to wonder how on earth did this guy get to be a barrister? But in the courtroom is where this guy shines. He is brilliant, though disheveled in dress, and appearance, and usually in need of a shave, he is the master of the cross examination. He's a defender of the accused lowlife's of society: drug dealers, murderers, thieves and anyone who has enough cash to pay his fees. After watching the first two seasons, I'm eagerly awaiting the release date of the third season. I've just heard that there's going to be an American spin-off the this series, which I don't see how it can even remotely compare to the Richard Roxburgh series. I might give it a try, but I expect to be disappointed.",5,Rake is the drug...and highly recommended!  by bugsplat,1390003200,"01 18, 2014",2014,1669,"['series', 'comedic', 'drama', 'when', 'comedic', 'rolling', 'floor', 'funny', 'Paul', 'Cleaver', 'Greene', 'played', 'Richard', 'Roxburgh', 'barrister', 'Australian', 'Bar', 'boatload', 'personal', 'problems', 'life', 'tragi-comic', 'juggling', 'act', 'multiple', 'crises', 'life', 'Greene', '2', 'ex-wives', 'one', 'barrister', 'other', 'private', 'practice', 'psychologist', 'teenage', 'son', 'fathered', 'Cleaver', 'high', 'school', 'exploding', 'hormones', 'penchant', 'getting', 'involved', 'older', 'women', 'secretary', 'who', 'ongoing', 'tax', 'problems', 'government', 'love', 'hooker', 'owes', 'bookies', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'still', ""n't"", 'cover', 'problems', 'times', 'cocaine', 'addiction', 'imbibes', 'alcohol', 'too', 'much', 'mouth', 'most', 'inopportune', 'moments', 'first', 'name', 'basis', 'bookies', 'muscle', 'who', 'occasional', 'beating', 'when', 'Cleaver', 'payments', 'one', 'wonder', 'how', 'earth', 'did', 'guy', 'get', 'be', 'barrister', 'courtroom', 'where', 'guy', 'brilliant', 'though', 'disheveled', 'dress', 'appearance', 'usually', 'need', 'shave', 'master', 'cross', 'examination', 'defender', 'accused', 'lowlife', 'society', 'drug', 'dealers', 'murderers', 'thieves', 'anyone', 'who', 'enough', 'cash', 'pay', 'fees', 'watching', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', ""'m"", 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'release', 'date', 'third', 'season', ""'ve"", 'just', 'heard', 'going', 'be', 'American', 'spin-off', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'can', 'even', 'remotely', 'compare', 'Richard', 'Roxburgh', 'series', 'might', 'give', 'try', 'expect', 'be', 'disappointed']",Rake

1539121,A3VNNI6PFNK901,B007W144RK,J. Gibson,"[26, 27]","Cleaver Greene has issues.  A lot of issues.  And his issues get him into trouble.  A lot of trouble.Cleaver is a very smart and talented barrister who can take literally any case and run with it to grab a win regardless of how unusual his client or the circumstances of the case.  The subject matter for his cases in this first season have ranged from a cannibal killer to a respectable doctor having been charged with bestiality.  There are mobsters, prostitutes, teachers with questionable ethics, diplomats and politicians that add more color to this series than you could see in any art gallery!Richard Roxburgh does a brilliant job bringing Cleaver Greene to life.  The character is charming and entertaining.  One minute, you truly sympathize with him and the next you can change your mind because it's blatantly clear the trouble he's in was of his own making.  He has more than a small problem with gambling and drugs and often finds himself taking a good bashing from stand over man Col (Steve Le Marquand) and answering to Col's boss, Mick Corella (Richard Carter).  Cleave manages to estrange himself from his long time best friend Barney ""Barnyard"" Meagher (Russell Dykstra) and his wife Scarlett (Danielle Cormack) after making a huge mistake with the latter.  Cleaver is more than a little bit fond of Melissa ""Missy"" Partridge, a former prostitute.  Cleave and his ex wife, Wendy (Caroline Brazier) have their hands full with their teenage son Finnegan ""Fuzz"" who is having an affair with one of his teachers.  Sadly, the poor lad loses the love of his life when said teacher leaves him for a younger man!The series was created by Richard Roxburgh, Peter Duncan and Charles Waterstreet.  Andrew Knight, along with co-creator Peter Duncan serve as the writers for the series.  Duncan and Knight are the perfect writing team as they have successfully created a show that is entertaining, full of complicated ups and downs, sprinkled with just the right amount of humor to lighten the serious moments but not to come off as silly and is populated by multi-faceted characters who are realistic, lovable and despicable.  Some of the humor is subtle such as Cleaver calling David Potter ""Harry"" but all of it is laugh-out-loud great.Casting was inspired.  Fans of Aussie television will recognize many faces in Rake.  International viewers should all be familiar to some extent with Roxburgh through such films as Moulin Rouge!, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and Van Helsing.  Even someone who is seeing Rake as an introduction to Australian television will soon find themselves wanting to see more from the cast in this series.Matt Day (David ""Harry"" Potter) can be seen in Underbelly:  The Golden Mile, Tangle and the soon-to-air Reef Doctors.  Steve Le Marquand (Col) took the lead as Tony Piccolo in Small Time Gangster.  Adrienne Pickering is noticeable from Home and Away.  Russell Dykstra has appeared on such hit Aussie shows as Wild Boys, Blackjack, and Spirited.  The amazingly beautiful Daniella Cormack who is quickly making a huge name for herself is recognizable from Xena:  Warrior Princess, City Homicide, East West 101, Underbelly: Razor and, most recently, Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries.  Noting was spared with the casting of guest actors, as well.  Lisa McCune (Sea Patrol), Sacha Horler (Small Time Gangster, Offspring & Crownies), Damon Herriman (Love My Way, Breaking Bad, Wilfred and Justified) and Richard Carter (East West 101, City Homicide and White Collar Blue) are all top-notch in their roles.  There are also some real gems making guest appearances.  David Field (Water Rats, City Homicide, Wild Boys, Blackjack) makes an appearance in episode four as a man accused of the murder of a 15 year old boy.  As with everything he is in, Field delivers a powerful performance worthy of award.  One of my very favorite actors, award winning and multi-nominated Sam Neill shines as Dr. Bruce Chandler in episode five.  The regular cast of Rake PLUS Sam Neill.  Could it get any better than that?  I think not!I don't believe viewers from the United States should have any problems adapting to this being an Australian series.  There isn't too much Aussie slang in the dialogue and from the legal standpoint, the atmosphere of the show is almost like watching an episode of Law & Order except the lawyers wear wigs and robes, as well as the judge.  Minutes into the first episode, American viewers should feel right at home and comfortable with their surroundings and really enjoy the series.  I personally think this series as as strong, if not stronger, than any series on American television.  Rake can hold its own against the likes of Law & Order, Breaking Bad, Monk, Republic of Doyle (Canadian, and another excellent show I highly recommend) and White Collar.Rake began airing on ABC1 in November 2010 with the first season containing eight episodes.  ABC1 commissioned a second series of Rake which began production in April 2012.  A date has yet to be given for the second series premiere but I am assuming since Rake was a summer series the first time around (November is summer in Australia) it will be the same for series two.  If so, November can't get here fast enough for this viewer!If you are a fan of well written, smart, very unique story lines and characters who are all over the personality map and delivered by some of Australia's finest then you will most definitely enjoy Rake.  It's a series that I hope has a long and healthy life on Aussie television so that it will have a long and healthy life on DVD here in the States!",5,Brilliant Aussie Drama/Comedy,1340668800,"06 26,

1539122,A356RFKNIG043B,B007W144RK,K. Swanson,"[0, 0]","It's been years since a tv show made me laugh as long and hard as the first few episodes of Rake did. Serious laughter! Roxburgh's truly genius portrayal of Cleaver is legendary, especially in this first season while it's all still fresh and hasn't gone soap yet, which it does in the  next two seasons. Cleaver Greene is based on Rox's friend and series co-creator Charles Waterstreet, an Ozzie barrister famous for similar exploits (his Australian newspaper columns are occasionally hilarious, look them up). But CW is no CG, whose political incorrectness is near total satire yet so deliciously funny. And Roxburgh is absolutely dead on at every moment here; his timing is exquisite, as are his micro-expressions. He can milk a brief glance like few others, as his over-the-top Dracula in Van Helsing showed, but this is clearly his comedic masterpiece.His foil is perfectly played by Dykstra, who emerges as the other best actor in Rake as the season goes on, and who highlights how truly unhinged his partner is. For sheer humor, this show never gets better than its first episode, where Hugo Weaving is perfection as an unassuming cannibal who can't see what all the fuss is about. The many ironies inherent in the way our meat-loving society is horrified by the idea of recycling ourselves are played to the hilt here. The genius of Rake, especially in the early part of the first season before it took off in Australia and they predictably started playing it a bit safer, is its gleeful skewering of humanity's moral and ethical hypocrisies. Cleaver's love of prostitution and blow and dissolution in general is juxtaposed with his caring nature to produce a painfully real protagonist-antihero, and once you start cheering for him it all blurs into a new realm of happily uncomfortable hilarity.I had no trouble understanding the various Aussie accents (though there are almost no Bruces, Sheilas or g'days, let alone shrimps on the barbie), and there are subtitles for certain political references other countries might not be familiar with. Sydney sure looks like a lovely city. O you lucky folks! One of the bonuses of this show is seeing how a similar but different society to the US and Europe operates...though sadly it appears corruption is endemic to mankind.As the season moves along, and more so as the second season gets going, romantic affairs take more precedence, and thus the real barbs of morality humor lessen. Which is why the first half of this season is where it's at for Rake; by the end of the series in season three, the somewhat real feel of this season has faded to pure tv goofiness. But here at the beginning, we get a surreally close examination of our daily fakeness in the weird world of laws we've created for ourselves, and Roxburgh's charisma and comic timing is at its best.I'd put his performance in the first few episodes of Rake up there with most any dramedy acting in cinema or the small screen of the past decade; the first disc of this dvd set will get plenty of play in my player as the years go by, because they caught some lightning in the bottle at the start of this unique show.One thing that gets better as the three seasons play out is Matt Day. He starts off as a buffoon and gently coaxes his character into a surprising amount of pathos while maintaining the humor. Damien Garvey is the other dark horse who shines later on, getting funnier by the show as he becomes the main pricker of ethical balloons. Caroline Brazier might be the quietest MVP while she lets everyone pivot around her. The only performance that isn't spot on is occasionally Pickering, who seems out of her league at points, indeed almost out of character as she seems to marvel at how funny Roxburgh is instead of inhabiting the scenes with him. But even that can't stop Cleaver from emerging non-victorious! His joy in messing up is a beautiful thing.The extras are nothing special...because there are none! Booooo! I would have liked an hour of bloopers...there must have been lots of good ones.If you love Python or other heavily ironic black humor, you've got to give this first season of Rake a try. It's an all-time classic.",5,Roxburgh the Great!

And for Richard Roxburgh.  He brings the character of keegan deane to life.  Keegan is a loveably misanthropic lawyer.  He deserves everything that comes his way.  He is challenging and impossible to live with - but somehow he makes you want to love him because of his flaws, not in spite of them.  The supporting cast is great (although I don't love Scarlett - but that may have more to do wtih her character than with the actress).I totally recommend watching this show if you can.  It's so much smarter than half - nay, three quarters - of what we have on our side of the Pacific.",5,This American loves the Aussie,1393459200,"02 27, 2014",2014,1081,"['discovered', 'Rake', 'year', 'two', 'immediately', 'fell', 'love', 'show', 'Rake', 'legal', 'dramedy', 'incredible', 'legal', 'dramedy', 'little', 'bit', 'early', 'seasons', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'back', 'when', 'Shatner', 'Spader', 'were', 'morally-ambiguous', 'lawyers', 'fighting', 'good', 'fight', 'David', 'E.', 'Kelly', 'turned', 'show', 'being', 'own', 'personal', 'political', 'agenda.But', 'digress.First', 'got', 'ta', 'accents', 'mean', 'really', 'might', 'watch', 'show', 'just', 'accents', 'alone', 'Richard', 'Roxburgh', 'character', 'keegan', 'deane', 'life', 'Keegan', 'loveably', 'misanthropic', 'lawyer', 'everything', 'way', 'challenging', 'impossible', 'live', 'somehow', 'want', 'love', 'flaws', 'not', 'spite', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'Scarlett', 'may', 'have', 'more', 'do', 'wtih', 'character', 'actress', 'totally', 'recommend', 'watching', 'show', 'can', 'so', 'much', 'smarter', 'nay', 'three', 'quarters', 'what', 'have', 'side', 'Pacific']",Rake
