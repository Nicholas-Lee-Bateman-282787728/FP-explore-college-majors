368678,A2HOLM5I1ARX9J,6303309194,"Carol C. ""ccjello""","[10, 10]","This superb documentary explores the origins and developments of traditional bluegrass, from the the early years of the 20th century through the 1970's.  It features a heavy dose of Bill Monroe, with a lot of Jimmy Martin, Mac Wiseman & Ralph Stanley rolled in.  A number of Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Boys alumni are also featured -- String Bean, Lester Flatt, Earl Scruggs.  I found myself fascinated by the commentary and singing along to most of the performances.  There are a number of clips that standing alone would make this DVD worth the money -- Bill Monroe clogging while picking his mandolin at what looks like a county fair, Ralph Stanley singing ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" (Ralph Stanley singing a capella gospel never fails to give me goosebumps), and hippie ""flower children"" in San Francisco grooving to bluegrass in the early 1970's.  There are also some great clips of other wonderful performers -- A young, unpolished Alison Krauss, a young overly-polished George Jones in his crewcut days, singing ""White Lightning"", a young Porter Waggoner.  In addition, there is commentary by two rail-thin farmers, wearing overalls & fedoras & leaning on hoes in a field, talking about the backdrop against which bluegrass music gained and lost popularity, discussing the struggles of the depression and that crazy hip-swinging Elvis who had people ""throwing their babies at him"" and everything.  This is such a great DVD -- I know that I'll watch this again and again, and share it with several of my friends and family (and I'm half tempted to run out & buy myself a banjo and spend the next few years trying to learn to play like Earl Scruggs.)",5,a must if you love traditional bluegrass,1050105600,"04 12, 2003",2003,1650,"['superb', 'documentary', 'origins', 'developments', 'traditional', 'bluegrass', 'early', 'years', '20th', 'century', '1970', 'heavy', 'dose', 'Bill', 'Monroe', 'lot', 'Jimmy', 'Martin', 'Mac', 'Wiseman', 'Ralph', 'Stanley', 'rolled', 'number', 'Bill', 'Monroe', 'Bluegrass', 'Boys', 'alumni', 'are', 'also', 'featured', 'String', 'Bean', 'Lester', 'Flatt', 'Earl', 'Scruggs', 'found', 'fascinated', 'commentary', 'singing', 'along', 'most', 'performances', 'are', 'number', 'clips', 'standing', 'alone', 'would', 'make', 'DVD', 'money', 'Bill', 'Monroe', 'clogging', 'picking', 'mandolin', 'what', 'county', 'fair', 'Ralph', 'Stanley', 'singing', 'Man', 'Constant', 'Sorrow', 'Ralph', 'Stanley', 'singing', 'capella', 'gospel', 'never', 'give', 'goosebumps', 'hippie', 'flower', 'children', 'San', 'Francisco', 'grooving', 'bluegrass', 'early', '1970', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'clips', 'other', 'wonderful', 'performers', 'young', 'unpolished', 'Alison', 'Krauss', 'young', 'overly-polished', 'George', 'Jones', 'crewcut', 'days', 'singing', 'White', 'Lightning', 'young', 'Porter', 'Waggoner', 'addition', 'commentary', 'two', 'rail-thin', 'farmers', 'wearing', 'overalls', 'fedoras', 'leaning', 'hoes', 'field', 'talking', 'backdrop', 'bluegrass', 'music', 'gained', 'lost', 'popularity', 'discussing', 'struggles', 'depression', 'crazy', 'hip-swinging', 'Elvis', 'who', 'had', 'people', 'throwing', 'babies', 'everything', 'such', 'great', 'DVD', 'know', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'share', 'several', 'friends', 'family', ""'m"", 'half', 'tempted', 'run', 'out', 'buy', 'banjo', 'spend', 'next', 'few', 'years', 'trying', 'learn', 'play', 'Earl', 'Scruggs']",High Lonesome - The Story of Bluegrass Music VHS

I feel transported back to an earlier time where I can better understand the lives of my grandparents and those that came before them.This is partly due to the outstanding archival filmage which traces the history of bluegrass amidst a cultural backdrop of family farms, railroads and coal mines. The most attention is correctly given to the great Bill Monroe. He recites the words to his songs and visits the old family home while also discussing the musical influence of his Uncle Pen and his childhood years in rural Kentucky. Of course, many other outstanding bluegrass performers are also featured, including Ralph Stanley, Jimmy Martin and Mac Wiseman.  The doc also includes some more recent concert footage with contemporary bluegrass artists such as Allison Krauss and Seldom Scene.Whether you are a newcomer who wants to learn more about bluegrass or a longtime fan seeking to enjoy the music and interviews from some of the all-time greats, this is an excellent film and comes highly recommended.",5,The Glorious History of Bluegrass!,1204502400,"03 3, 2008",2008,1167,"['family', 'heritage', 'early', 'English', 'Scotch-Irish', 'settlers', 'Blue', 'Ridge', 'Mountains', 'doc', 'special', 'feeling', 'feel', 'transported', 'back', 'earlier', 'time', 'where', 'can', 'better', 'understand', 'lives', 'grandparents', 'came', 'them.This', 'partly', 'due', 'outstanding', 'archival', 'filmage', 'history', 'bluegrass', 'amidst', 'cultural', 'backdrop', 'family', 'farms', 'railroads', 'coal', 'mines', 'most', 'attention', 'correctly', 'given', 'great', 'Bill', 'Monroe', 'words', 'songs', 'old', 'family', 'home', 'also', 'discussing', 'musical', 'influence', 'Uncle', 'Pen', 'childhood', 'years', 'rural', 'Kentucky', 'course', 'many', 'other', 'outstanding', 'bluegrass', 'performers', 'are', 'also', 'featured', 'including', 'Ralph', 'Stanley', 'Jimmy', 'Martin', 'Mac', 'Wiseman', 'doc', 'also', 'more', 'recent', 'concert', 'footage', 'contemporary', 'bluegrass', 'artists', 'such', 'Allison', 'Krauss', 'Seldom', 'Scene.Whether', 'are', 'newcomer', 'who', 'learn', 'more', 'bluegrass', 'longtime', 'fan', 'seeking', 'enjoy', 'music', 'interviews', 'all-time', 'greats', 'excellent', 'film', 'highly', 'recommended']",High Lonesome - The Story of Bluegrass Music VHS

If you like bluegrass or are interested in learning more about it this disc is for you - It has the feel of a Ken Burns documentary (He was a consultant) and goes into great detail of the life and times of the father of bluegrass, Bill Monroe.The First third focuses in on the early days of bluegrass and Bill Monroe's youth.  The middle shows alot of the various lineups of Bill Monroe and his bluegrass boys - and footage of the various &quot;boys&quot; when they went solo.  The final third has some real magic in it when the crew visits the many bluegrass festivals.  Here the real magical performances are one of the Osborne Bros. from the late 60's doing Ruby (Incredible - unfortunatly this is not the whole performance) and the amazing group The Seldom Scene doing one of the best renditions of Know You Rider that I have ever heard - these two are worth the price of admission alone.Being a guitarist/banjo picker I was finding myself playing along and even picking up some new licks and rolls - especially when Flatt &amp; Scruggs are highlighted - whew! - Scruggs was a banjo god.  Very entertaining - a little slow in some parts and a few musicians that should have been mentioned were missing (namely David Grisman, Vassar Clements (he can be seen in one segment w/ Bill Monroe but that's it), Ricky Skaggs, Tony Rice,  and maybe a little more on some of the novelty acts like Bluegrass 45 - this is the only reason I give it 4 and not 5 stars - but don't let that stop you - this DVD is GREAT !This is a barebones DVD and could really have benefitted from a better sound, but I guess since many of the early recording were in mono - it was not an option - but it could have still used and benefitted from a dolby digital track, another track of the complete recordings would have made this pure gold - but I'm not complaining.",4,Thoroughly Enjoyable,991958400,"06 8, 2001",2001,1974,"['Chock', 'full', 'great', 'bluegrass', 'music', 'old', 'footage', 'early', 'days', 'many', 'artists', 'found', 'disc', 'be', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'like', 'bluegrass', 'are', 'interested', 'learning', 'more', 'disc', 'feel', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'documentary', 'was', 'consultant', 'great', 'detail', 'life', 'times', 'father', 'bluegrass', 'Bill', 'Monroe.The', 'First', 'third', 'focuses', 'early', 'days', 'bluegrass', 'Bill', 'Monroe', 'youth', 'middle', 'alot', 'various', 'lineups', 'Bill', 'Monroe', 'bluegrass', 'footage', 'various', 'quot', 'quot', 'when', 'went', 'solo', 'final', 'third', 'real', 'magic', 'when', 'crew', 'many', 'bluegrass', 'festivals', 'Here', 'real', 'magical', 'performances', 'are', 'one', 'Osborne', 'Bros.', 'late', '60', 'doing', 'Ruby', 'Incredible', 'unfortunatly', 'not', 'whole', 'performance', 'amazing', 'group', 'Seldom', 'Scene', 'doing', 'one', 'best', 'renditions', 'Know', 'Rider', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'two', 'are', 'price', 'admission', 'alone.Being', 'guitarist/banjo', 'picker', 'was', 'finding', 'playing', 'along', 'even', 'picking', 'up', 'new', 'licks', 'rolls', 'especially', 'when', 'Flatt', 'amp', 'Scruggs', 'are', 'highlighted', 'whew', 'Scruggs', 'was', 'banjo', 'god', 'Very', 'entertaining', 'little', 'slow', 'parts', 'few', 'musicians', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'mentioned', 'were', 'missing', 'namely', 'David', 'Grisman', 'Vassar', 'Clements', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'one', 'segment', 'w/', 'Bill', 'Monroe', 'Ricky', 'Skaggs', 'Tony', 'Rice', 'maybe', 'little', 'more', 'novelty', 'Bluegrass', '45', 'only', 'reason', 'give', '4', 'not', '5', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'DVD', 'GREAT', 'barebones', 'DVD', 'could', 'really', 'have', 'benefitted', 'better', 'sound', 'guess', 'many', 'early', 'recording', 'were', 'mono', 'was', 'not', 'option', 'could', 'have', 'still', 'used', 'benefitted', 'dolby', 'digital', 'track', 'track', 'complete', 'recordings', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'pure', 'gold', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining']",High Lonesome - The Story of Bluegrass Music VHS

Bill Monroe's life and music beautifully dominate a penetrating look at bluegrass music and the land that birthed it. Monroe's musicianship is astounding; his voice is like a lonesome wail, a tantalizing, gripping mix of pain and joy. He's an artist of immense stature, and High Lonesome does his legacy justice. This is a rowdy portrait of Appalachia and the hard South, salted with anecdotal contributions from people who live there, their music and stories of the artists who've succeeded in making a very persuasive art known and loved beyond a regional world. I gathered a bundle of heart from this film, and learned to love Monroe's music even more. One of the best moments is watching the grin wrap around Jimmy Dickens' face as he sings '20/20 vision, walkin' around blind...'. The film's chock full of nugget after nugget of pure music, resilient humanity, and an authentic film vision, all of it enriching to the max! High Lonesome delves into the importance of radio in its early days, and finishes with a blazing look at bluegrass festivals (lots of full performances are included!) and a number of current bluegrass performers, the unbeatable Allison Krauss among them. It's a film to watch again and again, one that stays true to its heart, and pulls you in for a memorable, at times haunting experience! Recommended enthusiastically - you wont be disappointed.
