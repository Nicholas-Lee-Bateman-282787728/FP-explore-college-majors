123188,A33L7G4E8CID3,0792106164,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[3, 4]","Probably the best anti-war movie ever made, Gallipoli is potent largely because of its dedication to its characters. The story centers around two young Aussie men who sign up to fight for the Allies in the Great War (a.k.a. WWI). Their reasons for signing up are different. Archy (Mark Lee) signs up out of patriotic fervor--after all, if you don't fight them over there, they'll come over here, right? Frank (Mel Gibson) doesn't share his friend's views but he joins because he really has nothing else to do. The two meet at a track meet--it seems that Frank is a sort of sports hustler--but Archy proves a bit faster, which really comes to bear near the end of the movie. Frank and Archy traverse the Australian outback, only to be split up and ultimately reunited in Egypt in time for the final battle at Gallipoli, which is rendered quite faithfully. Once you see the film's final image, you will never be able to forget it. It is nice to see a movie which is deliberately slow-paced in order to allow for penetrating insight into the protagonists, and by the time the bullets start flying, they feel like old chums to us. It's authentic to life, and ultimately unforgettable.This is a movie where nearly everything just clicks. The performances are great: Gibson shines as the roguish Frank. It's hard to imagine, but there was a time when Mel Gibson wasn't exclusively dedicated to his own vanity projects, and even earlier than that, he was an interesting and eminently watchable actor. Gallipoli is the first of a trilogy (with The Year of Living Dangerously and The Bounty) which show Gibson the actor at his finest. Lee provides a potent counterpoint as one who remains loyal to the cause, up until the final charge. The supporting cast is great as well. The movie is directed by Peter Weir, who is one of the best directors out there, in my own opinion. The scenery is compelling and realistic, about the only thing that's off is the Tangerine Dream music, which immediately dates this film as a product of the early 80's. Otherwise, though, this is one of the best movies of the decade of the 1980s, and surely as one of the great Australian films (although I admit ignorance in this area). It transcends nationality and offers a compelling portrait of human relationships which are tested and tested again, as well as a frighteningly, maddeningly accurate portrait of World War I.

The movie is in three parts: the first takes place in Australia where Gibson and Lee are introduced and become friends; the second in Cairo where they train; and the third at Gallipoli where they are eventually slaughtered, thanks to poor British planning and the failure of British commanders to muster up the will to take initiatives when they became available.

123202,A1S3C5OFU508P3,0792106164,Charles Ashbacher,"[4, 5]","When two coalitions of nations are at war against each other, there are two fundamentally different tactics for victory that are proposed. The first is to go all out against the strongest of the enemy coalition, the idea being that if you defeat that nation, the lesser partners will automatically surrender. This has the potential problem that you can be soundly defeated, further strengthening the resolve of the weaker nations.The second strategy is to hold against the strong and concentrate your strength against the weaker. By defeating one of the nations in the coalition, you can raise doubts about the ultimate victory in the minds of your enemy and raise morale at home. The problem with this strategy is that the weaker nation may be a liability to the stronger one, defeating it may not weaken the stronger nation and force you to support a nation on the verge of chaos.Winston Churchill was a strong proponent of the second strategy, in both the first and second world wars. In the Second World War, he advocated attacking the European Axis powers ""soft underbelly"", which he described as Italy. While Italy surrendered and switched sides shortly after being invaded, the battle for Italy was anything but soft and was probably more costly than effective.In the First World War, Churchill was the main proponent of forcing an opening of the straights of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. Controlled by Turkey, an ally of Germany, if the Allies could seize them, it would probably have knocked Turkey out of the war and allowed a free flow of men and materials between the Russian Empire and the Mediterranean Sea. It was a good idea poorly thought through and poorly executed. It was a classic case of a desk bound politician/military leader looking at a map, seeing a short distance and thinking that if their armies are only determined and brave, they will be able to win. There was also the arrogance in believing that the Turkish soldiers were a weaker class of soldiers that those of the British Empire.This movie is an excellent demonstration of the patriotic naivet&eacute; of the masses of people in the early years of the First World War. The young Australian men depicted in this film had everything to look forward to and no real reason to risk their lives for British interests. The grandfather of the Mel Gibson character was murdered by the British, yet after some initial hesitation, he eventually volunteers to fight. Most of the movie is devoted to providing the background of the lives of these young men, how they reacted to the patriotic calls to action and how they interacted. They were comrades, both on and off the battlefield, standing together as mates.All of this builds to the climax of what happened so many times in the First World War. The men were relatively safe in the trenches, yet were ordered to rise up and charge prepared and fortified Turkish positions on higher ground of the Gallipoli peninsula. Even after the first attack led to a slaughter, the commander, off somewhere out of sight of the killing area, ignored the statements of his field commander and ordered a second and third attack. The men knew that they were going to their deaths, yet, like good soldiers, they wrote notes to their loved ones and charged the Turks. When we were watching this action, my wife asked me, ""Did this really happen?"" My response was, yes, these were the standard tactics all along the Western front as well.This is a powerful movie about war and the stupid political and military decisions that make it possible and lead to it being poorly executed. It was historically accurate, from the terrain and the action; you get a very realistic appraisal of one of the most pointless battles of the First World War. The British eventually withdrew from Gallipoli and abandoned the idea of seizing the straights, having accomplished nothing other than the senseless deaths of thousands of brave young men.

Middleton,"[5, 5]","Gallipoli is a significant historical event in Australia's national conscious; it is that place on the timeline that is celebrated as an experience that shaped the nation's identity. Australia came of age during the Great War, where young men were sent to a foreign land to fight an enemy they didn't know. These were the times not to question why. ""There's the enemy, here's your gun, now kill them."" War was something romantic in those days, but the massive carnage from this war changed this view significantly. The world was not the same after WW1. However, this was the crowning event that symbolically moved our awareness as a nation from a fledgling English colony to a country with all its unique aspects of culture. Every year Australian's travel to the shores of Gallipoli to reflect and remember our ancestors who fought so bravely and lost their lives. Despite losing these battles in such sad and devastating circumstances, this was a defining moment in our past, because these men who lost their lives became our national heroes. These men are Australia's representatives of everything this country holds dear -mateship, individuality, the anti-authoritarian attitude and courage. This extraordinary film captures the history and legend of Gallipoli and truly reflects the Australian character at the turn of the century, and some aspects of this national character remain even today.This is one of Peter Weir's early films before he travelled to Hollywood and made his mark as a director of world renown. This is also one of Mel Gibson's early films and his performance begins to reveal hints of his future international stardom. The story is well crafted and the cinematography along with the heart-wrenching soundtrack comes together in a near perfect film.From my recent experience, it has been a rare occasion to come away from a film feeling sad, joyful, moved and proud all at the same time. It doesn't matter how many times I see this film, these feelings continue to rise to the surface, reminding me of our follies as human beings, but also our capacity to be a do great things.~Gallipoli~ is an outstanding film in every way.",5,One of the great  Australian films,1066867200,"10 23, 2003",2003,2150,"['Gallipoli', 'significant', 'historical', 'event', 'Australia', 'national', 'conscious', 'place', 'timeline', 'celebrated', 'experience', 'shaped', 'nation', 'identity', 'Australia', 'came', 'age', 'Great', 'War', 'where', 'young', 'men', 'were', 'sent', 'foreign', 'land', 'fight', 'enemy', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'were', 'times', 'not', 'question', 'why', 'enemy', 'here', 'gun', 'now', 'kill', 'War', 'was', 'something', 'romantic', 'days', 'massive', 'carnage', 'war', 'changed', 'view', 'significantly', 'world', 'was', 'not', 'same', 'WW1', 'However', 'was', 'crowning', 'event', 'symbolically', 'moved', 'awareness', 'nation', 'fledgling', 'English', 'colony', 'country', 'unique', 'aspects', 'culture', 'year', 'Australian', 'travel', 'shores', 'Gallipoli', 'reflect', 'remember', 'ancestors', 'who', 'fought', 'so', 'bravely', 'lost', 'lives', 'losing', 'battles', 'such', 'sad', 'devastating', 'circumstances', 'was', 'defining', 'moment', 'past', 'men', 'who', 'lost', 'lives', 'became', 'national', 'heroes', 'men', 'are', 'Australia', 'representatives', 'everything', 'country', 'dear', '-mateship', 'individuality', 'anti-authoritarian', 'attitude', 'courage', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'history', 'legend', 'Gallipoli', 'truly', 'Australian', 'character', 'turn', 'century', 'aspects', 'national', 'character', 'remain', 'even', 'one', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'early', 'films', 'travelled', 'Hollywood', 'made', 'mark', 'director', 'world', 'renown', 'also', 'one', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'early', 'films', 'performance', 'reveal', 'hints', 'future', 'international', 'stardom', 'story', 'well', 'crafted', 'cinematography', 'heart-wrenching', 'soundtrack', 'together', 'near', 'perfect', 'film.From', 'recent', 'experience', 'been', 'rare', 'occasion', 'come', 'away', 'film', 'feeling', 'sad', 'joyful', 'moved', 'proud', 'same', 'time', ""n't"", 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'see', 'film', 'feelings', 'continue', 'rise', 'surface', 'reminding', 'follies', 'human', 'beings', 'also', 'capacity', 'be', 'do', 'great', 'things.~Gallipoli~', 'outstanding', 'film', 'way']",N/A

Further from their thoughts still may be the battle fought at Gallipoli by the Australians and New Zealanders against the &quot;Fuzzies&quot; - the Turks.As part of the British Empire, the Aussies and the Kiwis were expected to fight for honor and country, but the &quot;Empire&quot; was merely using them as fodder and for diversion. It was a battle that the Empire knew could not be won, but one they wanted fought all the same.Gallipoli the film, demonstrates the ridiculousness of the British system of awarding officership to those from well-bred stock simply by virtue of their birth and not based on ability or skill.  It becomes painfully obvious to even the most pedestrian of viewers that those in charge hadn't a clue how to win this battle, but were more interested in maintaining proper British custom and etiquette.Mel Gibson (in an early role) and Mark Lee play friends/mates who learn friendship as a result of their love of running (track).  Lee's character has the skill and ability to excel, but he is too young to enlist.  His love of country is so strong, he forges his documents and is accepted into the army equestrian corp.  Gibson joins as well, more out of loyalty to his &quot;mate&quot; than to country and obligation.This drama shows the lengths to which two young men will go to defend honor, country, and friendship.  While it shows one of the most realistic battle scenes shown with regard to this war, it is not a war picture.The final scene of this film is so riveting and heartbreaking that it is impossible to view it without shedding more than a few tears.  It is further impossible to view it without finding a palpable anger deep inside for those who would put in charge those who lack the fundamental skills to strategize in favor of those with station in society.I highly recommend this film.

Which isn't to say that there haven't been any necessary wars in history (ex: WW II) but they are always a tragedy and generally a pointless slaughter. If the film isn't a ""real war film"" to some, this suggests that anyone who would write that has been brainwashed into thinking that war is only about bravery and camaraderie and action and excitement. While those things certainly do appear in war, I don't imagine many veterans would argue that it is worth the cost in horror.I saw this film as a young boy when it came out, it was one of my first ""grown up"" films and I loved it then and still love it now.  There's a priceless scene where the young idealistic man who wishes to sign up tries to explain (to an old outback hand) why Australia is at war with Turkey because a Serb murdered an Austrian.There is, in my opinion, a lot of action...as in footracing. The Jean-Michel Jarre soundtrack sounds a little dated today but I still enjoy it.

123220,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,0792106164,Jeffrey Leach,"[130, 142]","It's unfortunate in the extreme that the First World War has largely fallen by the wayside. If we hear anything about the conflict at all, it's usually on the History Channel or another network airing a documentary full of grainy, black and white clips of men stumbling over the top of trenches. Interest in historical events tends to drop off significantly when those involved pass away, and in the case of the generation that fought this horrific war not only have they exited the stage, they have left the building as well. I developed a life long interest in ""the war to end all wars"" after seeing Peter Weir's 1981 film ""Gallipoli"" in a small, run down art house theater at the age of ten. I didn't understand the historical context at the time, but this dramatic interpretation of events that unfolded in the Dardanelles during 1915 left a lasting impression on my impressionable mind. I recently rewatched the film and can say that it still works as an intense drama and as a serious antiwar statement. Weir's overt hostility toward the British commanders at Gallipoli, however, doesn't stand up as well. By the way, this is one of the films that propelled Mel Gibson to international stardom.Weir decided to focus his film not on the massive armies battling away in Europe, but on two individuals living in Australia. Archy Hamilton (Mark Lee) and Frank Dunne (Mel Gibson) are two of the fastest runners in the country. Hamilton trains with his demanding grandfather, who promises the young lad that if he works hard he may yet go down as the next national sports hero. Frank, on the other hand, wanders around the country with a few buddies taking any job he can get and generally just having a lot of fun. News of the escalating war in Europe is vague and distant, referenced only when someone brings up a news story they saw in the paper. Archy wants to go and fight, attracted by the lure of glory that has suckered millions of young people since the dawn of time into disaster. Frank doesn't think of war as glory, and when his pals bring up the idea of enlisting he quietly makes his position known. Both of these young men's lives are forever changed after the end up competing against each other in a foot race at a regional fair. Archy barely wins, but a friendship develops between the two that soon finds Frank tagging along when Archy decides to enlist in the illustrious cavalry. Frank agrees to join with Archy, once he discovers that the ladies love a soldier, but goes into the infantry after failing to qualify for the light horse unit.It really doesn't matter anyway since horses won't make a bit of difference when the ANZAC (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) soldiers head first to Egypt and then the Dardanelles for combat against the Ottoman Turks. What the war effort needs are bodies capable of running headlong into a withering wall of machine gun fire, and cavalry troops minus their steeds will work in this capacity just as well as infantrymen. Before they reach the killing fields, Archy and Frank reunite during a training exercise in Egypt. Hamilton convinces his commander to enlist Dunne in the cavalry, claiming that his skills as a runner rival his own and that both men will make a major contribution to the regiment. Weir shows us plenty of carefully crafted scenes of the men having a good time in Cairo, of the deepening camaraderie taking place even as the war looms larger and larger in the background. The movie takes a doom and gloom turn as the ANZAC forces land at Gallipoli to take part in the fighting. Casualties mount as attacks designed to expand the beachhead fail under Turkish machine guns. Soon, Archy and Frank know they will have to go over the top too, and realize they will certainly perish in the process. The conclusion to ""Gallipoli"" is one of the most emotionally grinding, soul shattering denouements in motion picture history.The only thing I found extremely irritating about ""Gallipoli"" is the cheesy synth musical score, which now sounds so early 1980s that it dates the picture terribly. I think the message about how people join up to go to war for all the wrong reasons, however, is still highly relevant. And if there was any war that everyone should have avoided, it was World War I. Generals and leaders still subscribed to antiquated notions of warfare, never taking into account machine guns, poison gas, and airplanes would decimate the troops. The fatalities were truly appalling, with millions perishing in muddy trenches during the four year conflict. Weir expertly depicts the squalid conditions of the trenches, but he goes too far blaming the film's fatal charge on the British commanders. First of all, far more British soldiers died during the campaign in the Dardanelles than did members of ANZAC. Second, why place the onus for the war on the British? Plenty of commanders on all sides made mistake after mistake in this conflagration, mistakes that resulted in so many fatalities that it's a wonder humanity didn't rise up and cast their leaders into the fire.""Gallipoli"" wins the day in the end thanks to the charm of Mark Lee and Mel Gibson. Weir's cinematography sinks its claws in as well. Check out the shots of the Australian outback, the Red Cross party, and the landing at Gallipoli to learn why. The transfer looks good, but the only extra on the disc is a short interview with Weir about the making of the film. I wanted a commentary track for this film desperately, and still hope a special edition will arrive on the market in the near future.

The movie stars Mel Gibson and this film reminds you when he was Mel the actor, not Mel the drunk-driver. The movie takes place in Australia, where we meet Archy (Mark Lee), the fastest kid around. On the day he's to participate in a race, Frank Dunne (Gibson) arrives. Frank is just as fast as Archy, but still loses to the kid. When the race is over, Archy decides to join the Light Horses (sort of an army with horses) to go fight in Turkey during World War I rather than go home. Problem is, he's only 18 and they won't let him enlist despite his talents on horseback. Frank, with nothing better to do, offers to travel with Archy to Perth where he won't be recognized by the recruiters and he can join. Frank doesn't want to join anything, but by the time they arrive there he is prompted too. After he fails to make it into the Light Horses, Frank opts for the infantry where he is reunited with other ""mates"" of his but loses contact for a long while with Archy. The movie's final moments are very powerful, especially it's final image. Peter Weir is a great director, but I had yet to see a film by him that had really grabbed me. I guess my opinion isn't that solid considering I've only seen 3 of his films previously, but ""Gallipoli"" is the exception. This is a film about war and friendship (the former is one of my least favorite kinds of movies and the latter is a cliche), but this film is incredibly original and (again) powerful. Gibson is superb in his role, sporting a fake Australian accent that never faulters. Not only is the film great, but it's also entertaining (something a number of great films aren't).

War was still a ""game"" as it was in the limited European wars of the 1800's.  Cavalry dashed about on horses, infantry wore bright uniforms and became heroes if they survived a single battle and casualty numbers were low by the standards of the 20th century.Unfortunately, technology and industrialization had changed war forever and the ""game"" or ""adventure"" of the 1800's was far more deadly.  Unfortunately, no one informed the officers of these changes, so TEN MILLION soldiers were slaughtered while the strategists continued to send men over open ground against entrenched enemeies that were waiting with machine guns.  The ""adventure"" lasted about ten feet from your own trench, as the final battle scenes of ""Gallipoli"" accurately depict.The ending of the movie seems harsh at first, but on reflection is the only fair way to be true to a failed campaign that was poorly planned and ultimately accomplished nothing.  As many soldiers were killed at Gallipoli as the entire US Civil War.

Although it doesn't have the blood-and-thunder approach of 'Saving Private Ryan', it's just as memorable, and played out almost in real time. The actual attack was over and done with within forty minutes, with the eventual loss of over 300 ANZAC soldiers in an area the size of a tennis court - a small total compared to the tens of thousands killed at the Somme and Passchendaele, but just as horrific for being essentially futile.The soundtrack seems to be causing some controversy in these reviews - for some reason, Weir chose part of Jean Michel Jarre's synth opus 'Oxygene' to go over the top of the bits where the main characters are running, an odd choice which, although not massively distracting, seems a bit old-fashioned nowadays.

123242,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,0792106164,Octavius,"[8, 9]","Peter Weir's touching drama on the naivetes of youth, war, and the loss of innocence.  A good script brought to life by the acting talents of Mel Gibson and Mark Lee.The story follows the lives of two young Australians aspiring to be Olympic runners at the onset of World War I.  Despite their dreams of Olympic greatness, the two friends abandon their personal interests and answer England's call to war during World War I.  Naive and hot-blooded the two men volunteer to join and, after brief training, are soon shipped off to the bloody fields of Gallipoli to fight the Turks.  Face to face with carnage and placed at risk by the incompetence in their own superiors, the youths soon realize that the war wasn't as glorious as they had once thought.  The cinematography is excellent and the film is well paced.  The tragic mood of the film is wonderfully amplified by the playing of Albinoni's 'Adagio' while the carnage ensues.  Both Mel Gibson and Mark Lee perform very well as the young athlete soldiers.  The theme of the film is very much in the style of Homer's Iliad: tragic heroes who meet their Fate in the pursuit of 'Arete'/the Greek notion of personal excellence.  The two youths know their prowess and strive to be the best personnally and in their civic duties.  Tragically, as with many of the tragic heroes in the Iliad, their youth and hot-bloodedness becomes their demise in the harsh realities of war.The film focuses too much on the British command for the failure of the Alliance's attack on Turkey as a result of its Australian bias.  The French and the Italians were equally to blame in the botched beach assault.  Instead of carrying out a synchronized attack to suppress the Turkish positions on the bluffs by naval bombardment, the English decided to send their navy on a tangential attempt at crossing the straits and knocking out certain coastal forts along the way that were no immediate threat to ANZAC or the other landing points.  They were hoping to secure an eventual avenue towards Asia Minor from Istanbul and to control the Black Sea yet failed to realize that this would achieve absolutely nothing unless they secured Gallipoli first.  The only thing the Royal Navy achieved by this stupid plan was to eliminate the element surprise and give away the initiative: it only gave the Turks an idea of what plan was afoot and enough time to deploy into their already entrenched positions.  The French and Italian navies also pretty much sat back and watched the slaughter instead of putting their heads together and doing something.  These strategic and tactical problems were present on the political and military level during the planning stage of the operation.  These problems were rampant in WWI on the Western Front as there were often too many commanders who could never agree as to what to do over a static front covering hundreds of miles other than pointlessly sending men to certain death for minor gains.  This organizational problem in war was also prevalent in the hodge-podge campaigns of the Crimean War in 1855 (e.g. The Light Brigade), and to a lesser degree in WWII at Dunkirk and Germany's disastrous Russian campaign.  There were simply too many armies and commanders independently trying to make a decisive blow resulting in no coordination whatsoever.  Another major, if not overriding, factor for these problems is that compared to all other wars, WWI had the same problems as with The US Civil War, in that their high attrition was caused by the major unanticipated leaps of the Industrial Revolution and its effects on military theory: tactical and strategic concepts had not yet caught up to technology affecting logistics, strategy, and/or tactics such as rifles; locomotives; automobiles; planes; machine guns; long range artillery; and, chemical warfare.

123246,A292YWWNFVSIWY,0792106164,Publius,"[6, 6]","Despite being the seminal conflict in the modern world, World War I gets scant attention from the movie industry.  Maybe this is because the War lacks the personality of a Macarthur, the villainy of a Hitler or the genius of a Patton.  However, for some countries like Australia, New Zealand or Canada, the War gave them recognition and status, apart from their place in the British empire.  ""Gallipoli"" follows the exploits of two young Australian men as they march into the tumult and utter meaninglessness of that War.  Their journey does not end in the mud and filth of the Western Front, but rather ends in the windswept mountains of the Dardanelles.  Weir expertly weaves the ever present Adagio for Strings, as the movie moves towards its inexorable and tragic ending.  Yes, the other music in the movie seems dated now, and makes one wonder how much control Weir had in the other aspects of the soundtrack production.  Apparently, he had enough control so that Albinoni's haunting Adagio foreshadows the loss of innocence not only for these young men, but also for their country.  Anyone who has followed the movies of Weir realize his attention to detail, and ""Gallipoli"" is no exception.  The little vignettes right before the end are worth mentioning here: the taking off of the ring and the track medals hanging in the trench.  Many war movies have shown the moments before the attack, but few have captured it with as much raw emotional intensity as this.  And after the attack, the Adagio returns as the blood red credits roll.  Besides being a classic war movie, it continues to be one of Weir's greatest works.",4,The Essence of World War I,1127779200,"09 27, 2005",2005,1626,"['being', 'seminal', 'conflict', 'modern', 'world', 'World', 'War', 'scant', 'attention', 'movie', 'industry', 'Maybe', 'War', 'personality', 'Macarthur', 'villainy', 'Hitler', 'genius', 'Patton', 'However', 'countries', 'Australia', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Canada', 'War', 'gave', 'recognition', 'status', 'apart', 'place', 'British', 'empire', 'Gallipoli', 'exploits', 'two', 'young', 'Australian', 'men', 'march', 'tumult', 'utter', 'meaninglessness', 'War', 'journey', 'not', 'end', 'mud', 'filth', 'Western', 'Front', 'rather', 'windswept', 'mountains', 'Dardanelles', 'Weir', 'expertly', 'ever', 'present', 'Adagio', 'Strings', 'movie', 'inexorable', 'tragic', 'ending', 'Yes', 'other', 'music', 'movie', 'dated', 'now', 'one', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'control', 'Weir', 'had', 'other', 'aspects', 'soundtrack', 'production', 'Apparently', 'had', 'enough', 'control', 'Albinoni', 'haunting', 'Adagio', 'loss', 'innocence', 'not', 'only', 'young', 'men', 'also', 'country', 'Anyone', 'who', 'followed', 'movies', 'Weir', 'realize', 'attention', 'detail', 'Gallipoli', 'exception', 'little', 'vignettes', 'right', 'end', 'are', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'here', 'taking', 'off', 'ring', 'track', 'medals', 'hanging', 'trench', 'Many', 'war', 'movies', 'have', 'shown', 'moments', 'attack', 'few', 'have', 'captured', 'as', 'much', 'raw', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'attack', 'Adagio', 'returns', 'blood', 'red', 'credits', 'roll', 'being', 'classic', 'war', 'movie', 'be', 'one', 'Weir', 'greatest', 'works']",N/A
123247,A2UIXU97JYCPZG,0792106164,R. Albin,"[25, 27]","This excellent film is probably the best movie made by the talented Australian director Peter Weir.  While Weir has a made a number of very good films, notably The Year of Living Dangerously and the recent Master and Commander, the subject matter of Gallipoli is the most serious of any of Weir's films.  Gallipoli is the general title for the series of WWI battles in which the Western Allies attempted to force the Dardanelles and knock Turkey out of the war.  Some, including Winston Churchill, himslef one of the prime movers behind the campaign, argued that Allied success at Gallipoli would have been decisive.  This has been disputed by recent historians.  The Gallipoli campaigns were the first large scale attempt at amphibious assault and were an organizational and tactical disaster.  The Allied commanders flubbed several chances to beat the Turks. The Turkish defense was tenacious and much of the action became the trench warfare characteristic of much of WWI.  The Allies failed, at great cost, though Turkish casulties were also quite high.Gallipoli holds a special resonance for Australians.  The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) was the first major overseas participation of Australian and New Zealand troops fighting as national formations.  The ANZACs fought courageously, prefiguring the outstanding performance of Australian and New Zealand infantry in both World Wars.  Gallipoli appears to occupy the place in Australian history that the Civil War occupies in American life.  Australia (possibly also New Zealand) is the only country that regularly celebrates a major military defeat.Weir's movie is a powerful depiction of the Australian experience at Gallipoli.  The story is simple.  A pair of friends from Western Australia enlist, are sent to Gallipoli, and one of them dies in one of the famous and bungled attacks characteristic of the campaign, indeed of the whole war.  Weir uses this conventional war movie formula in particularly creative ways.  A good deal of the movie takes place prior to enlistment.  Weir uses these scenes to convey his image of Australia as rural, provincial, starkly beautiful, and in important ways, profoundly innocent.  The war scenes are beautifully prepared and photographed.  Weir and his team apparently used a careful study of photographs from Gallipoli to construct scenes in the movie.  I recognized parts of scenes as being almost identical to some famous photos of trench life in Gallipoli.  The scenes before and during the climactic assault are devastatingly powerful.This film was made in Australia, by Australians, and for Australians.  Some important aspects of the story are simply assumed.  These are things that would be known by Australians but not by Americans.  The infantry assault depicted in the film were diversions and part of the Battle of Suvla Bay, an attempt to break out of the limited beachheads established in the initial landings.  Had the Suvla Bay attacks been successful, the Allies would have beaten Turkey in 1915.  Suvla Bay almost succeeded and failed largely because of poor leadership and communications.  Because of the latter, the sacrifice of the ANZACs was entirely wasted.  Australian audiences would know this and this fact gives the ending of the film a particularly bitter flavor.  The end of the movie shows the suicidal attack of the Light Horse on entrenched Turkish positions.  The Light Horse suffered 50% casulties that morning.",4,Weir's Best Film,1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,3459,"['excellent', 'film', 'probably', 'best', 'movie', 'made', 'talented', 'Australian', 'director', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'Weir', 'made', 'number', 'very', 'good', 'films', 'notably', 'Year', 'Living', 'Dangerously', 'recent', 'Master', 'Commander', 'subject', 'matter', 'Gallipoli', 'most', 'serious', 'Weir', 'films', 'Gallipoli', 'general', 'title', 'series', 'WWI', 'battles', 'Western', 'Allies', 'attempted', 'force', 'Dardanelles', 'knock', 'Turkey', 'war', 'including', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'himslef', 'one', 'prime', 'movers', 'campaign', 'argued', 'Allied', 'success', 'Gallipoli', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'decisive', 'been', 'disputed', 'recent', 'historians', 'Gallipoli', 'campaigns', 'were', 'first', 'large', 'scale', 'attempt', 'amphibious', 'assault', 'were', 'organizational', 'tactical', 'disaster', 'Allied', 'commanders', 'flubbed', 'several', 'chances', 'beat', 'Turks', 'Turkish', 'defense', 'was', 'tenacious', 'much', 'action', 'became', 'trench', 'warfare', 'characteristic', 'much', 'WWI', 'Allies', 'failed', 'great', 'cost', 'Turkish', 'casulties', 'were', 'also', 'quite', 'high.Gallipoli', 'special', 'resonance', 'Australians', 'Australian', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Army', 'Corps', 'ANZAC', 'was', 'first', 'major', 'overseas', 'participation', 'Australian', 'New', 'Zealand', 'fighting', 'national', 'formations', 'ANZACs', 'fought', 'courageously', 'prefiguring', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Australian', 'New', 'Zealand', 'infantry', 'World', 'Wars', 'Gallipoli', 'occupy', 'place', 'Australian', 'history', 'Civil', 'War', 'occupies', 'American', 'life', 'Australia', 'possibly', 'also', 'New', 'Zealand', 'only', 'country', 'regularly', 'major', 'military', 'defeat.Weir', 'movie', 'powerful', 'depiction', 'Australian', 'experience', 'Gallipoli', 'story', 'simple', 'pair', 'friends', 'Western', 'Australia', 'enlist', 'are', 'sent', 'Gallipoli', 'one', 'one', 'famous', 'bungled', 'attacks', 'characteristic', 'campaign', 'indeed', 'whole', 'war', 'Weir', 'conventional', 'war', 'movie', 'formula', 'particularly', 'creative', 'ways', 'good', 'deal', 'movie', 'place', 'prior', 'enlistment', 'Weir', 'scenes', 'convey', 'image', 'Australia', 'rural', 'provincial', 'starkly', 'beautiful', 'important', 'ways', 'profoundly', 'innocent', 'war', 'scenes', 'are', 'beautifully', 'prepared', 'photographed', 'Weir', 'team', 'apparently', 'used', 'careful', 'study', 'photographs', 'Gallipoli', 'construct', 'scenes', 'movie', 'recognized', 'parts', 'scenes', 'being', 'almost', 'identical', 'famous', 'photos', 'trench', 'life', 'Gallipoli', 'scenes', 'climactic', 'assault', 'are', 'devastatingly', 'powerful.This', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Australia', 'Australians', 'Australians', 'important', 'aspects', 'story', 'are', 'simply', 'assumed', 'are', 'things', 'would', 'be', 'known', 'Australians', 'not', 'Americans', 'infantry', 'assault', 'depicted', 'film', 'were', 'diversions', 'part', 'Battle', 'Suvla', 'Bay', 'attempt', 'break', 'limited', 'beachheads', 'established', 'initial', 'landings', 'Had', 'Suvla', 'Bay', 'been', 'successful', 'Allies', 'would', 'have', 'beaten', 'Turkey', '1915', 'Suvla', 'Bay', 'almost', 'succeeded', 'failed', 'largely', 'poor', 'leadership', 'communications', 'latter', 'sacrifice', 'ANZACs', 'was', 'entirely', 'wasted', 'Australian', 'audiences', 'would', 'know', 'fact', 'ending', 'film', 'particularly', 'bitter', 'flavor', 'end', 'movie', 'suicidal', 'attack', 'Light', 'Horse', 'entrenched', 'Turkish', 'positions', 'Light', 'Horse', 'suffered', '50', '%', 'casulties', 'morning']",N/A

One underage, full of patriotism and sense of duty. The other, a bit older with no delusions, who seeks opportunity and adventure. Gallipoli is a peninsula on the Dardanelles in Turkey. In WWI, Winston Churchill wanted to knock Turkey out of the War by sending the Navy up the Dardanelles to take Istanbul but could not get past the fortifications guarding the narrow passage.  Churchill called for an invasion to take the forts out, and that invasion quickly turned into a slaughter of epic proportions. The two young men are from Western Australia and join up with the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZACs).  They are sent to Egypt for training, which is way too short and way too haphazard, then straight off to war where the British are using them for cannon fodder.  The Battle of Gallipoli is an almost forgotten event for most of the West, and was considered more of a side show to the fighting in Europe. This battle almost destroyed Churchill, and was the blueprint for what not to do in the WWII invasion of Normandy.  In Australia, it is still a very large part of their culture.

I would be grateful to anyone who can identify the source. ""The generals thought they could do the job in three days. Land on the Gallipoli peninsula, clear it of Turks and disable the seaward defences. With a bit of luck it could all be accomplished in 72 hours. They failed too, and at a much greater cost in lives than the naval assault. For 259 days, from April 1915 to January 1916, the allied forces hung on to their toeholds on Gallipoli. A total of about 500,000 men were landed there over the course of the campaign and almost 300,000 of them became casualties. For the Turks it was a great victory and marked the time they successfully stood against the greatest empire the world had ever seen. It threw up Mustapha Kemal, an obscure divisional commander, and propelled him on the road that would lead him to become the `Father of the Nation.' For the Australians it would provide the sacrifice that tempered their newly-forged nation in blood. For the British it was just another fiasco in a war full of them."" I also want to acknowledge Ernest Raymond's novel Tell England, (subtitled A Study In A Generation), published in Great Britain in 1922 and now out-of-print.  Anthony Asquith directed an earlier film version (1931) of Raymond's novel, Battle of Gallipoli.Directed by Peter Weir and co-starring Mel Gibson (Frank Dunne) and Mark Lee (Archy), this film first focuses on Frank and Archy's childhood and youth, then shifts its attention to Gallipoli where so many of their eager and courageous comrades perished during combat with Turkish forces. So many lost their lives, to a significant extent because they were poorly-prepared for and then poorly-led in combat. To Weir's credit, he allows the narrative to unfold without (or so it seems to me) imposing his own political opinions. Some have referred to this film as being ""anti-war."" They may be correct but I prefer to view Gallipoli as an indictment of  morally corrupt and incompetent leaders who betray the trust of youth, waste their lives to achieve unrealistic objectives, and then wash their filthy hands in the blood of those whom they have sent to their death.The acting is consistently outstanding but even more impressive to me is the cinematography. Credit Russell Boyd with capturing a series of images which have an impact I lack the eloquence to describe. They simply must be seen. One is of naked young soldiers swimming beneath the surface of a harbor under attack and as they struggle to escape death, the water becomes pink. (I wonder if Spielberg had that scene in mind when he planned the water-level photography during the first action sequence in Saving Private Ryan.) Weir co-authored the spare but literate screenplay with David Williamson. Well-done indeed. Those who share my high regard for this film are urged to check out All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), Attack! (1956), Paths of Glory (1957), and The Big Red One and Breaker Morant (both released in 1980). The next time political and military leaders are seriously thinking about placing young men and women in harm's way, they should first be required to sit down and watch all of these films one after another...and then after taking a brief break, see them again.",5,Will senseless carnage ever end?,1079395200,"03 16, 2004",2004,3363,"['abundance', 'research', 'material', 'have', 'accumulated', 'years', 'here', 'brief', 'commentary', 'relevant', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'grateful', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'identify', 'source', 'generals', 'thought', 'could', 'do', 'job', 'three', 'days', 'Land', 'Gallipoli', 'peninsula', 'clear', 'Turks', 'disable', 'seaward', 'defences', 'bit', 'luck', 'could', 'all', 'be', 'accomplished', '72', 'hours', 'failed', 'too', 'much', 'greater', 'cost', 'lives', 'naval', 'assault', '259', 'days', 'April', '1915', 'January', '1916', 'allied', 'forces', 'hung', 'toeholds', 'Gallipoli', 'A', 'total', '500,000', 'men', 'were', 'landed', 'there', 'course', 'campaign', 'almost', '300,000', 'became', 'casualties', 'Turks', 'was', 'great', 'victory', 'marked', 'time', 'successfully', 'stood', 'greatest', 'empire', 'world', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'threw', 'up', 'Mustapha', 'Kemal', 'obscure', 'divisional', 'commander', 'propelled', 'road', 'would', 'lead', 'become', 'Father', 'Nation', 'Australians', 'would', 'provide', 'sacrifice', 'tempered', 'newly-forged', 'nation', 'blood', 'British', 'was', 'just', 'fiasco', 'war', 'full', 'also', 'want', 'acknowledge', 'Ernest', 'Raymond', 'novel', 'Tell', 'England', 'subtitled', 'Study', 'A', 'Generation', 'published', 'Great', 'Britain', '1922', 'now', 'out-of-print', 'Anthony', 'Asquith', 'directed', 'earlier', 'film', 'version', '1931', 'Raymond', 'novel', 'Battle', 'Gallipoli.Directed', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'co-starring', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Frank', 'Dunne', 'Mark', 'Lee', 'Archy', 'film', 'first', 'Frank', 'Archy', 'childhood', 'youth', 'then', 'attention', 'Gallipoli', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'eager', 'courageous', 'comrades', 'perished', 'combat', 'Turkish', 'forces', 'So', 'many', 'lost', 'lives', 'significant', 'extent', 'were', 'poorly-prepared', 'then', 'poorly-led', 'combat', 'Weir', 'credit', 'narrative', 'unfold', 'so', 'imposing', 'own', 'political', 'opinions', 'have', 'referred', 'film', 'being', 'anti-war', 'may', 'be', 'correct', 'prefer', 'view', 'Gallipoli', 'indictment', 'morally', 'corrupt', 'incompetent', 'leaders', 'who', 'betray', 'trust', 'youth', 'waste', 'lives', 'achieve', 'unrealistic', 'objectives', 'then', 'wash', 'filthy', 'hands', 'blood', 'whom', 'have', 'sent', 'death.The', 'acting', 'consistently', 'outstanding', 'even', 'more', 'impressive', 'cinematography', 'Credit', 'Russell', 'Boyd', 'capturing', 'series', 'images', 'have', 'impact', 'lack', 'eloquence', 'describe', 'simply', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'One', 'naked', 'young', 'soldiers', 'swimming', 'surface', 'harbor', 'attack', 'struggle', 'escape', 'death', 'water', 'pink', 'wonder', 'Spielberg', 'had', 'scene', 'mind', 'when', 'planned', 'water-level', 'photography', 'first', 'action', 'sequence', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'co-authored', 'spare', 'literate', 'screenplay', 'David', 'Williamson', 'Well-done', 'indeed', 'who', 'share', 'high', 'regard', 'film', 'are', 'urged', 'check', 'out', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', '1930', 'Attack', '1956', 'Paths', 'Glory', '1957', 'Big', 'Red', 'One', 'Breaker', 'Morant', 'released', '1980', 'next', 'time', 'political', 'military', 'leaders', 'are', 'seriously', 'thinking', 'placing', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'harm', 'way', 'should', 'first', 'be', 'required', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'films', 'one', 'then', 'taking', 'brief', 'break', 'see', 'again']",N/A
123258,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,0792106164,Roger J. Buffington,"[6, 7]","This is a movie that packs a powerful emotional punch.  It follows the introduction of two young Australian &quot;mates&quot; (&quot;pals&quot; to us Americans) from their ordinary lives back in Australia to their introduction to the Army and ultimately to the reality and waste of battle.  The time is World War 1, the place: the Gallipoli invasion, which was a disastrous British attempt to invade Turkey.  Australian youths are being recruited for service in Europe as part of the British Army.  As the lads say: &quot;England needs a hand so here we are.&quot;Mark Lee and Mel Gibson play the two youths.  Both do a fine job.  About my only criticism of the movie is that it drags a bit in the beginning, while the lads are still in Australia, but otherwise the story line moves along reasonably well.  The conclusion is deeply moving--the film's ending packed an emotional wallop that is hard to describe.  I am no anti-war activist, but I've never seen a movie that showed the futility and waste of war and its squandering of promising young lives in a more effective way.One of the wonderful things about this movie is that it lacks the pretentiousness and dishonesty of films like &quot;Platoon&quot; which are out to send a blunt political message.  This movie does not do that.  It has a wonderful authenticity and even innocence.  It is beautifully done.  Anyone who ever served will recognize that the inevitable miscommunications and mistakes that the film ultimately centers on are always with us to some degree in the military.  The film does send a message, but it does so in a way that respects the viewer.This one is highly recommended.

What was involved was an invasion of the Gallipoli Peninsula by the combined forces of Britain, Australia, New Zealand and France. The Gallipoli Peninsula is south of Istanbul  and the aim of the operation was to seize the Turkish capital and to cut of their land route to Germany and Austria. In fact the operation was a disaster. The Turks were able to concentrate their forces and to contain the Imperial army. Eventually they had to withdraw after suffering considerable casualties. The campaign is of importance in the history of Turkey as it made the career of Mustafa Kemal. It is also important in the history of Australia and New Zealand as it was seen as forging their national character. In Australia it is still celebrated by a national day of mourning.The film tells the story from the perspective of two Australian soldiers who fought at Anzac cove. They are country lads who are talented sprinters and who volunteer to join the Australian Light Horse. (Cavalry) The first part of the film deals with their meeting and the development of their friendship. The later part of the film deals with their training and the actual fighting.The film has a mild anti war feel to it. Considering the nature of the campaign this is not a total surprise. The Australian forces were landed by mistake in a cove area which had steep cliffs going to the sea. The Australian troops became stalled on these hills and for the life of the campaign were at the mercy of Turkish troops on higher ground, who were able to continually snipe at them and roll hand grenades into their positions. Any Australian attacks had to be up hill against well prepared positions.The climax of the film is a poorly organised attack. The bombardment which was to mask the attacking infantry ended before the time scheduled for the attack. This enabled the Turks to man their positions and to mow down the attacking infantry forces. This was in fact based on a true event and it led to media pressure to end the campaign.For a person who has grown up in Australia or New Zealand the film is a moving account of an important event in one's history. Others who are not familiar with the events around the film may perhaps not enjoy it as much.",4,Good historical drama,1014854400,"02 28, 2002",2002,2316,"['Gallipoli', 'Campaign', 'was', 'attempt', 'Imperial', 'forces', 'put', 'Turkey', 'war', '1915', 'What', 'was', 'involved', 'was', 'invasion', 'Gallipoli', 'Peninsula', 'combined', 'forces', 'Britain', 'Australia', 'New', 'Zealand', 'France', 'Gallipoli', 'Peninsula', 'south', 'Istanbul', 'aim', 'operation', 'was', 'seize', 'Turkish', 'capital', 'cut', 'land', 'route', 'Germany', 'Austria', 'fact', 'operation', 'was', 'disaster', 'Turks', 'were', 'able', 'concentrate', 'forces', 'contain', 'Imperial', 'army', 'Eventually', 'had', 'withdraw', 'suffering', 'considerable', 'casualties', 'campaign', 'importance', 'history', 'Turkey', 'made', 'career', 'Mustafa', 'Kemal', 'also', 'important', 'history', 'Australia', 'New', 'Zealand', 'was', 'seen', 'forging', 'national', 'character', 'Australia', 'still', 'celebrated', 'national', 'day', 'mourning.The', 'film', 'story', 'perspective', 'two', 'Australian', 'soldiers', 'who', 'fought', 'Anzac', 'cove', 'are', 'country', 'lads', 'who', 'are', 'talented', 'sprinters', 'who', 'volunteer', 'join', 'Australian', 'Light', 'Horse', 'Cavalry', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'deals', 'meeting', 'development', 'friendship', 'later', 'part', 'film', 'deals', 'training', 'actual', 'fighting.The', 'film', 'mild', 'anti', 'war', 'feel', 'Considering', 'nature', 'campaign', 'not', 'total', 'surprise', 'Australian', 'forces', 'were', 'landed', 'mistake', 'cove', 'area', 'had', 'steep', 'cliffs', 'going', 'sea', 'Australian', 'troops', 'became', 'stalled', 'hills', 'life', 'campaign', 'were', 'mercy', 'Turkish', 'troops', 'higher', 'ground', 'who', 'were', 'able', 'continually', 'snipe', 'roll', 'hand', 'grenades', 'positions', 'Australian', 'attacks', 'had', 'be', 'up', 'hill', 'well', 'prepared', 'positions.The', 'climax', 'film', 'poorly', 'organised', 'attack', 'bombardment', 'was', 'mask', 'attacking', 'infantry', 'ended', 'time', 'scheduled', 'attack', 'enabled', 'Turks', 'man', 'positions', 'mow', 'down', 'attacking', 'infantry', 'forces', 'was', 'fact', 'based', 'true', 'event', 'led', 'media', 'pressure', 'end', 'campaign.For', 'person', 'who', 'grown', 'up', 'Australia', 'New', 'Zealand', 'film', 'moving', 'account', 'important', 'event', 'one', 'history', 'Others', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'events', 'film', 'may', 'perhaps', 'not', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much']",N/A

Two young men, both runners, become friends who go off to war with the idea of defeating the Germans in WWI, but end up in the trenches fighting the Turks with virtually no way to win or even to stay alive.

123272,AQP1VPK16SVWM,0792106164,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[2, 3]","An infamous conflict in history that occurred during WW I, ""Gallipoli"" comes around for the infamous double dip from Paramount. This time around, though, Paramount gets it right and includes a six part documentary on the real conflict and the making of the movie. This was the first vehicle where I caught my first performance of Mel Gibson who along with Mark Lee create the heart and soul of Weir's terrific film about the brutality of war. The film has aged remarkable well despite the use of early synthesizer music as an occasional score (much like ""Chariots of Fire"" whose synthesizer score pleasant as it is has aged badly).Archy Hamilton (Lee) runs like the wind. He's got the speed and ability to be an Olympic caliber athlete but his idealistic beliefs pull him away from running to serve in the war in the Australian cavalry. He's joined by rival Frank Dunne (Mel Gibson) another amazing sprinter who competes for the money. The two strike up an unlikely friendship after their match against each other and end up enlisting despite Dunne's initial disinterest in becoming yet another body trying to outrun flying bullets. This harsh indictment of the b senseless nature of war and how it robs the world of promising young men in their prime allows Weir to wax on the nature of what war costs a nation. Weir avoids the politics of right or wrong regarding the conflict instead focusing on the terrible cost war visits on human life. The visuals are frequent stunning and ""Gallipoli"" like Weir's earlier films continued to show the breathtaking development of an amazing filmmaker with as much intelligence behind the camera as skill with it.Paramount's previous release looked extremely good on DVD. This edition looks remarkable sharp and crisp with a nice reproduction of the textures, colors and clarity of the theatrical release. The 5.1 audio sounds fine here although clearly it isn't used to the optimal effect it could be given the film's age.We get a six part documentary on the making of the film that also includes a bit of history. Featuring interviews with the late Bill Gammage author of ""The Broken Years"", film director Weir, screenwriter Williamson actors Gibson, Lee and others from the production of the film the documentary focuses initially on the conditions that provoked the country to become involved in WWI despite no direct threat to their nation. It's far from the dry documentaries that many people are accustomed to, the inclusion of those who were involved in the production of the film discussing the circumstances of the conflict at Gallipoli makes the documentary far more entertaining and interesting that one might expect otherwise. Inspired by Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory"" Weir decided to do the film after visiting Gallipoli in Turkey. There's footage that shows the historically preserved location. Weir discusses the emotional impact of his visit and how it solidified his decision to make the movie. Weir relates how there are still items from the war at the site. Weir brought Williamson on as the writer and the film's genesis actually began in 1977 with their collaboration. They went through many drafts before discovering the core story. Gammage's book which included letters from actual soldiers from the time became the touchstone for Weir and Williamson. We also get the original theatrical trailer for the film. There's no commentary track as Weir isn't a fan of commentary tracks.A terrific film, this is a bitter reminder of the callousness of war. For those that feel the need to enlist this is an enlightening reminder that the job of the military isn't a game nor is it a frat. Once called into service war is a brutal, nasty business that plucks whole generations and wipes them from the face of the Earth sometimes for a questionable cause. Without going into the politics of the war, Weir brilliant visualizes the destruction of war and the script written by David Williamson provides perfectly realized characters in this powerful film.",5,Classic deluxe edition of Peter Weir's film,1136160000,"01 2, 2006",2006,4002,"['infamous', 'conflict', 'history', 'occurred', 'WW', 'Gallipoli', 'around', 'infamous', 'double', 'dip', 'Paramount', 'time', 'around', 'though', 'Paramount', 'right', 'six', 'part', 'documentary', 'real', 'conflict', 'making', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'vehicle', 'where', 'caught', 'first', 'performance', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'who', 'Mark', 'Lee', 'create', 'heart', 'soul', 'Weir', 'terrific', 'film', 'brutality', 'war', 'film', 'aged', 'remarkable', 'well', 'use', 'early', 'synthesizer', 'music', 'occasional', 'score', 'much', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'synthesizer', 'score', 'pleasant', 'aged', 'badly', '.Archy', 'Hamilton', 'Lee', 'wind', 'got', 'speed', 'ability', 'be', 'Olympic', 'caliber', 'athlete', 'idealistic', 'beliefs', 'pull', 'away', 'running', 'serve', 'war', 'Australian', 'cavalry', 'joined', 'rival', 'Frank', 'Dunne', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'amazing', 'sprinter', 'who', 'money', 'two', 'strike', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'match', 'other', 'end', 'up', 'enlisting', 'Dunne', 'initial', 'disinterest', 'becoming', 'yet', 'body', 'trying', 'outrun', 'flying', 'bullets', 'harsh', 'indictment', 'b', 'senseless', 'nature', 'war', 'how', 'world', 'promising', 'young', 'men', 'prime', 'allows', 'Weir', 'wax', 'nature', 'what', 'war', 'nation', 'Weir', 'politics', 'right', 'wrong', 'regarding', 'conflict', 'instead', 'focusing', 'terrible', 'cost', 'war', 'visits', 'human', 'life', 'visuals', 'are', 'frequent', 'stunning', 'Gallipoli', 'Weir', 'earlier', 'films', 'continued', 'show', 'breathtaking', 'development', 'amazing', 'filmmaker', 'as', 'much', 'intelligence', 'camera', 'skill', 'it.Paramount', 'previous', 'release', 'looked', 'extremely', 'good', 'DVD', 'edition', 'remarkable', 'sharp', 'crisp', 'nice', 'reproduction', 'textures', 'colors', 'clarity', 'theatrical', 'release', '5.1', 'audio', 'sounds', 'fine', 'here', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'used', 'optimal', 'effect', 'could', 'be', 'given', 'film', 'age.We', 'get', 'six', 'part', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'also', 'bit', 'history', 'Featuring', 'interviews', 'late', 'Bill', 'Gammage', 'author', 'Broken', 'Years', 'film', 'director', 'Weir', 'screenwriter', 'Williamson', 'actors', 'Gibson', 'Lee', 'others', 'production', 'film', 'documentary', 'initially', 'conditions', 'provoked', 'country', 'become', 'involved', 'WWI', 'direct', 'threat', 'nation', 'far', 'dry', 'documentaries', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'accustomed', 'inclusion', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'production', 'film', 'discussing', 'circumstances', 'conflict', 'Gallipoli', 'documentary', 'far', 'more', 'entertaining', 'interesting', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'otherwise', 'Inspired', 'Kubrick', 'Paths', 'Glory', 'Weir', 'decided', 'do', 'film', 'visiting', 'Gallipoli', 'Turkey', 'footage', 'historically', 'preserved', 'location', 'emotional', 'impact', 'visit', 'how', 'solidified', 'decision', 'make', 'movie', 'Weir', 'how', 'are', 'still', 'items', 'war', 'site', 'Weir', 'brought', 'Williamson', 'writer', 'film', 'genesis', 'actually', 'began', '1977', 'collaboration', 'went', 'many', 'drafts', 'discovering', 'core', 'story', 'Gammage', 'book', 'included', 'letters', 'actual', 'soldiers', 'time', 'became', 'touchstone', 'Weir', 'Williamson', 'also', 'get', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'film', 'commentary', 'track', 'Weir', ""n't"", 'fan', 'commentary', 'tracks.A', 'terrific', 'film', 'bitter', 'reminder', 'callousness', 'war', 'feel', 'need', 'enlist', 'enlightening', 'reminder', 'job', 'military', ""n't"", 'game', 'frat', 'Once', 'called', 'service', 'war', 'brutal', 'nasty', 'business', 'whole', 'generations', 'face', 'Earth', 'sometimes', 'questionable', 'cause', 'going', 'politics', 'war', 'Weir', 'brilliant', 'destruction', 'war', 'script', 'written', 'David', 'Williamson', 'perfectly', 'realized', 'characters', 'powerful', 'film']",N/A
