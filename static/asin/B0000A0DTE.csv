760818,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B0000A0DTE,Acute Observer,"[1, 2]","The Scarlet Letter, 1934 filmThe `Foreword' says this is a ""portrait of the Puritan period in American life"". A woman is condemned for ""malicious gossip"" and is punished and ridiculed. A man is in the stocks for laughing on the Sabbath. A bell calls the people to the town square. A stranger walks into town and hears the news. Hester Prynne is guilty of adultery! ""Has she no shame?"" She won't name her fellow sinner and confess. ""No, never!"" They force her to wear a scarlet letter so all men can shun her. [Did that really work?] Seamstress Prynne has a visitor: Arthur Dimmesdale the minister. Should there be a bigger scandal? ""Bless you, Hester."" Roger Chillingsworth signs his name, the colony needs a good doctor. He needs a place to stay, and is directed to Hester's cottage! ""We have wronged each other."" [We learn their background.] They will keep their secrets. The years pass by.Two men work to change a cart wheel; they don't have a pile of flat stones to support the cart! ""When I was a girl things were very different."" Little boys play their games, imitating the town militia. Mistress Abigail enjoys insulting Hester and her daughter. Can they recognize the father's features in Hester's daughter? The other children will not play with Pearl. A man summons Hester, the town council may take Pearl away. Master Dimmesdale argues for Hester's keeping Pearl. We see their custom of courtship. A courting trumpet provides privacy in a crowd. ""No."" Can a man suffer from a guilty conscience? Can a bodily sickness be caused by a spiritual problem? Dimmesdale instructs Pearl in religion. We see church services. No sleeping in church! Muskets are stacked in the church aisle for easy access. Dimmesdale makes a veiled confession. Hester aids a sick woman. This woman tells Roger how Dimmesdale comforted Hester.Dimmesdale's conscience troubles him. Hester and Roger meet to discuss the situation. It is a sin for a man to touch a woman's nether garments! Hester meets Arthur in the woods and tells him about an enemy under his roof. Hester advises Arthur to leave town for a new start. The men make merry on elections day. Some will leave town on a ship. Roger taunts Arthur, who decides to tell all in a public confession. The bell is struck to end Arthur's story.I never read the book, it seems like a comment on 17th century Puritan society when religious men were the rulers. Was it inspired by some now forgotten scandal from the 19th century? I wonder how many today are guilty of ""malicious gossip"" when talk radio shows prosper and people watch Hollywood gossip shows on TV? The commandment against bearing false witness is broken daily in most people's lives. Current scandals about businessmen, politicians, and even religious leaders should warn you against trusting people in authority.

760819,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0000A0DTE,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[5, 6]","The very first adaptation of The Scarlet Letter was a silent picture released in 1926, but this 1934 version is the first to feature sound.  That and the great disservice it does to the underlying story are its only claims to fame.  The original novel by Nathaniel Hawthorne is one of the most respected, best-known works of literature to ever grace the printed page, and this adaptation of that great novel is exceedingly strange.  Certainly, The Scarlet Letter is a somber, contemplative story, but that is where it's all-too-human heart lies.  The makers of this film, for reasons I fail to comprehend, chose to add comedy to the production, thereby producing one of the weirdest movies I have ever suffered through.  With a length of sixty-eight minutes, it naturally glosses over much of the emotional and plot-driven wonders of the novel, but its own scarlet sin is the inclusion of a number of entirely purposeless scenes designed to produce laughs.  I think I am safe in saying that The Scarlet Letter and comedy do not and certainly should not go hand in hand.  We get only the most basic of outlines of Hester Prynne's sin and subsequent life bearing the scarlet letter.  The casting of 20s flapper Colleen Moore to play Hester seems to be something of a mistake to my eyes, as I never really saw her as the Hester Prynne I have known fairly well for a number of years now.  Arthur Dimmesdale comes across pretty well, although we have no sign until the very end of any of the self-flagellating punishments he inflicted upon himself as penance for the sin he was too cowardly to acknowledge.  Henry B. Walthall reprises his 1926 role as Roger Chillingworth, but the depth of his own iniquity is never really laid bare, although we are privy to his plans regarding the unfortunate Mr. Dimmesdale.  The child who played Pearl was very good, though, and helped make up for some of the larger faults of the other character representations.Two things ruined this movie for me.  One is the awful cattiness of the women in the community; early on, we are treated to a number of ""in my day"" or ""they should have let us women take care of Hester's punishment"" speeches; while those kinds of thoughts or expressions probably do apply here, there is far too much of it in the movie.  What I really hated was the addition of a duo of dolts adding a Laurel &amp; Hardy aspect to the movie.  First they exchange smart remarks and the little guy finds himself supporting a heavy wagon on his back while his partner putters around interminably with a grin on his face, but later on the two become involved in a romantic triangle of sorts.  The big guy takes it upon himself to tell the little guy's chosen sweetheart just how much the little guy loves her; he does this by whispering back and forth to her through a marriage trumpet-naturally, the rather undesirable woman thinks the big guy is the prospective bridegroom-this Three's Company-esque situation only gets worse when both men accidentally see a pair of her ""nethergarments"" lying about.  This scene and these silly actors have no place at all in Nathaniel Hawthorne's remarkable story, and such inane, totally out-of-place comedy totally destroys the serious mood surrounding the Reverend Dimmesdale's overbearing guilt and Hester's praiseworthy steadfastness and struggle.This movie completely fails to capture the passion and emotion of the story it proposes to tell.  Without the needless comedy, it would be woefully incomplete yet watchable; with the ill-fated attempts at humor, it is hardly worth watching at all.",2,Proves that comedy has no place in The Scarlet Letter,1044835200,"02 10, 2003",2003,3577,"['very', 'first', 'adaptation', 'Scarlet', 'Letter', 'was', 'silent', 'picture', 'released', '1926', '1934', 'version', 'first', 'feature', 'sound', 'great', 'disservice', 'underlying', 'story', 'are', 'only', 'claims', 'fame', 'original', 'novel', 'Nathaniel', 'Hawthorne', 'one', 'most', 'respected', 'best-known', 'works', 'literature', 'ever', 'grace', 'printed', 'page', 'adaptation', 'great', 'novel', 'exceedingly', 'strange', 'Certainly', 'Scarlet', 'Letter', 'somber', 'contemplative', 'story', 'where', 'all-too-human', 'heart', 'makers', 'film', 'reasons', 'fail', 'comprehend', 'chose', 'add', 'comedy', 'production', 'thereby', 'producing', 'one', 'weirdest', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'suffered', 'length', 'sixty-eight', 'minutes', 'naturally', 'much', 'emotional', 'plot-driven', 'wonders', 'novel', 'own', 'scarlet', 'sin', 'inclusion', 'number', 'entirely', 'purposeless', 'scenes', 'designed', 'produce', 'laughs', 'think', 'am', 'safe', 'saying', 'Scarlet', 'Letter', 'comedy', 'do', 'not', 'certainly', 'should', 'not', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'get', 'only', 'most', 'basic', 'outlines', 'Hester', 'Prynne', 'sin', 'subsequent', 'life', 'bearing', 'scarlet', 'letter', 'casting', '20s', 'flapper', 'Colleen', 'Moore', 'play', 'Hester', 'be', 'something', 'mistake', 'eyes', 'never', 'really', 'saw', 'Hester', 'Prynne', 'have', 'known', 'fairly', 'well', 'number', 'years', 'now', 'Arthur', 'Dimmesdale', 'pretty', 'well', 'have', 'sign', 'very', 'end', 'self-flagellating', 'punishments', 'inflicted', 'upon', 'penance', 'sin', 'was', 'too', 'cowardly', 'acknowledge', 'Henry', 'B.', 'Walthall', '1926', 'role', 'Roger', 'Chillingworth', 'depth', 'own', 'iniquity', 'never', 'really', 'laid', 'bare', 'are', 'privy', 'plans', 'regarding', 'unfortunate', 'Mr.', 'Dimmesdale', 'child', 'who', 'played', 'Pearl', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'helped', 'make', 'up', 'larger', 'faults', 'other', 'character', 'representations.Two', 'things', 'ruined', 'movie', 'One', 'awful', 'cattiness', 'women', 'community', 'early', 'are', 'treated', 'number', 'day', 'should', 'have', 'let', 'women', 'take', 'care', 'Hester', 'punishment', 'speeches', 'kinds', 'thoughts', 'expressions', 'probably', 'do', 'apply', 'here', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'What', 'really', 'hated', 'was', 'addition', 'duo', 'dolts', 'adding', 'Laurel', 'amp', 'Hardy', 'aspect', 'movie', 'First', 'exchange', 'smart', 'remarks', 'little', 'guy', 'supporting', 'heavy', 'wagon', 'back', 'partner', 'putters', 'interminably', 'grin', 'face', 'later', 'two', 'become', 'involved', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'sorts', 'big', 'guy', 'tell', 'little', 'guy', 'chosen', 'sweetheart', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'little', 'guy', 'whispering', 'back', 'forth', 'marriage', 'trumpet-naturally', 'rather', 'undesirable', 'woman', 'big', 'guy', 'prospective', 'bridegroom-this', 'Three', 'Company-esque', 'situation', 'only', 'worse', 'when', 'men', 'accidentally', 'see', 'pair', 'nethergarments', 'lying', 'about', 'scene', 'silly', 'actors', 'have', 'place', 'Nathaniel', 'Hawthorne', 'remarkable', 'story', 'such', 'inane', 'totally', 'out-of-place', 'comedy', 'totally', 'serious', 'mood', 'surrounding', 'Reverend', 'Dimmesdale', 'overbearing', 'guilt', 'Hester', 'praiseworthy', 'steadfastness', 'struggle.This', 'movie', 'completely', 'capture', 'passion', 'emotion', 'story', 'tell', 'needless', 'comedy', 'would', 'be', 'woefully', 'incomplete', 'yet', 'watchable', 'ill-fated', 'attempts', 'humor', 'hardly', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
760820,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0000A0DTE,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[3, 4]","This adaptation of Hawthorne's novel is not a masterpiece according to today's cinematographic art. But it is an essential historical document on how the novel was seen in these old years, and how the cinema worked : with no special effects and no computers, not even color. And moreover it is an essential film because the vision of the novel and of the plot is, though short and simple, extremely faithful. We hence have a full drama of impossible repentance imposed onto one sinner by the other. Repentance has to be public or it is not. We also have a drastic vision of the punished woman becoming the glorified person whereas the man who goes unpunished by society is tenfold more punished by his own soul and guilt. Punished to death. This is the very reversal of the puritan vision by life that thus appears as denying any righteousness to puritanism. The point on which this film is rather deficient is the vision of the child. In those days it xas not that easy to get a child to perform this role, the role of Pearl. It is slightly regrettable because the child is the real center of the novel, in spite of what some may think. She is the real heroin and the true winning victim. At this level there is some cynism on the part of the novel and this film renders it very well.Dr Jacques Coulardeau",4,Secret repentance kills the soul and the body,1118188800,"06 8, 2005",2005,1306,"['adaptation', 'Hawthorne', 'novel', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'according', 'today', 'cinematographic', 'art', 'essential', 'historical', 'document', 'how', 'novel', 'was', 'seen', 'old', 'years', 'how', 'cinema', 'worked', 'special', 'effects', 'computers', 'not', 'even', 'color', 'moreover', 'essential', 'film', 'vision', 'novel', 'plot', 'short', 'simple', 'extremely', 'faithful', 'hence', 'have', 'full', 'drama', 'impossible', 'repentance', 'imposed', 'one', 'sinner', 'other', 'Repentance', 'be', 'public', 'not', 'also', 'have', 'drastic', 'vision', 'punished', 'woman', 'becoming', 'glorified', 'person', 'man', 'who', 'unpunished', 'society', 'tenfold', 'more', 'punished', 'own', 'soul', 'guilt', 'Punished', 'death', 'very', 'reversal', 'puritan', 'vision', 'life', 'thus', 'denying', 'righteousness', 'puritanism', 'point', 'film', 'rather', 'deficient', 'vision', 'child', 'days', 'not', 'easy', 'get', 'child', 'perform', 'role', 'role', 'Pearl', 'slightly', 'regrettable', 'child', 'real', 'center', 'novel', 'spite', 'what', 'may', 'think', 'real', 'heroin', 'true', 'winning', 'victim', 'level', 'cynism', 'part', 'novel', 'film', 'very', 'well.Dr', 'Jacques', 'Coulardeau']",N/A

Colleen Moore plays an unfortunate woman condemned to live in shame for bearing a child out of wedlock. This story is about Hester Prynne (Colleen Moore), a seamstress whose husband is away at sea, meets a young and charismatic Rev. Arthur Dimmesdale (Hardee Albright), falls in love and becomes pregnant with his child.  After the baby's birth, she keeps the identity of the father secret in spite of the punishment she must face: She is forced to wear ""A"" (adulteress) on her chest by the community leaders.Roger Prynne (Henry B. Walthall), Hester's middle-aged husband returns home from his long sea journey to find his young wife gave birth to baby-girl, lives in the community as Dr. Roger Dillingwell. Hester, in turn keeps her husband's identity a secret, knowing that he may take revenge on the father of her daughter. Hester faces a great deal of intimidation from the women in the neighborhood and her daughter Pearl (Cora Sue Collins) is treated as outcast by the children in the community. Arthur Dimmesdale suffers in his mind and heart, and unable to bear the pain of Hester and his daughter; he reveals his identity and his relationship with Hester during a community gathering.This is a stirring portrait of early Puritan America that was to shape the culture and traditions of a country founded by Christian fundamentalists.

In this film, it is more a good guy/ bad guy thing, where the mysterious husband is a bitter and manipulative man bent on vengeance.
