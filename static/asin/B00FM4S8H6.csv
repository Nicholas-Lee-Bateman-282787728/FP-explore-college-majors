1672104,ALD1CRUBY1365,B00FM4S8H6,R. L. MILLER,"[1, 2]","That was the question during the first season when it came to who was going to be the star and who was going to wind up ""second banana"". In fact, the description of the pilot episode in the Season One DVD set was all about John Kelly as played by David Caruso. Suave and urbane in the way you wouldn't expect of a New York City street cop. Almost like author Stuart Woods' character Stone Barrington as described in his long-running series of novels if Barrington was a redhead like Kelly rather than blond-haired as Woods has written him. On the other hand, Dennis Franz's Andy Sipowicz wasn't even mentioned by name in that episode's synopsis--merely as Kelly's ""partner with a drinking problem"".But Franz had had the chance to hone the character in an earlier, forgettable incarnation as the obnoxious Lt. Norman Buntz on Steven Bochco's earlier ""Hill Street Blues"", to where Buntz's ""descendant"" Sipowicz in this series has evolved into the most complex and interesting fictional TV cop ever. ""Blue's"" chief competitor ""Law & Order"" in its 20-year run turned over the entire cast--cops and lawyers alike--to where nobody in their inaugural season starring cast was still there at the end, but Sipowicz with various partners and commanders just kept on keepin' on, year after year. This is something that I'm not sure could be duplicated today, with the prevailing social stigma surrounding obesity. The Surgeon General has proclaimed obesity to be one of the most serious diseases out there and bada bing!--fat people are ""the new nerd"". At this writing, a certain state governor has hinted at Presidential ambitions, but the way he tips the scales is enough in and of itself that not very many people really take that (or him) very seriously.So now in this fifth season, it's clear that it's primarily Sipowicz, and his partners--while not really ""second bananas"" as such--have at least been interchangeable over the years. Jimmy Smits replaced Caruso during the sophomore season, while Caruso departed to head up ""CSI Miami"". That took care of the series' ""buddy flick"" aspect, which it had shared with most other cop procedurals in TV history. Next season, Smits is replaced by the boyish Rick Schroder under circumstances that the unwritten ""spoiler"" rule forbids me to describe. Not that any of us who are the series' fans can't remember anyway. But twelve seasons with an overweight lead whose temperament isn't exactly that of John Goodman as he appeared in ""Roseanne""! That's three times as good as the 4-year run of ""Highway Patrol"" starring Broderick Crawford as the gruff, micromanaging Chief Dan Matthews! At least we can hope it will also be twelve seasons for our DVD purposes. A fairly well-known re-release company who I'm not sure I'm allowed to name here came out with this season set in January after a 7-1/2 year hiatus and is set to release the Sixth Season in late June.
