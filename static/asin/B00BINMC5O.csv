1634878,A3JWR2O1MZ7VNE,B00BINMC5O,Elizabeth Renee Blue,"[1, 1]","I guess I will do another underdog review, seeing how few positive reviews this movie has. It seems like the latest trend is to bash horror movies, perhaps a reflection of the frustration horror fans feel about the genre's decline in the new millenium. I can relate to that but it only makes me appreciate it when a horror film actually entertains me, maybe even satisfies me, possibly even thrills me. I've seen too many, for too long now, to be actually scared by one so I am totally satisfied when it gets the tension going. . That's enough for me. Home, Sweet, Home definitely racheted up the tension. (The director is French and for some reason, the films that I recall as having generated impressive levels of tension in recent (last 10 years or so) horror films, have often been French.) Sure, the story is not new. Its a home invasion film. The story line is simple. Survival. The film clearly isn't going for more than being entertaining, not groundbreaking. Not every horror film is going to be groundbreaking. That's to be expected. You need the staples in order for the novel to stand out.  The production values are fine, the camera work is fine, the acting is fine. The villain generates menace. The protagonist(s) do &#34;scared&#34; well.  I watch at least 1 horror movie a day and so I've seen more than my fair share of 1 and 2 star movies. This is NOT one of them. A real 1 or 2 star movie is something like: The Wickeds. Satanic. Feeding Grounds. The Tomb, to name a few that I actually recall. Some I got suckered into by obviously planted glowing reviews for Instantwatch films on here that are amateurish and absurd. So now I take 4 and 5 star reviews for unknown productions as worth a grain of salt, as well as having to take the 1 or 2 star reviews as the same, due to the seeming &#34;let's bash the latest horror movie&#34; fad going on. Reviews are becoming meaningless it seems. So how to know if you should take my word for it? All I can offer is this: if you are a horror junkie, watch horror almost compulsively, (like your day is not complete if you haven't watched at least 1 horror film, and if that one didn't hit the spot perhaps you will stay up later to try another), and you have gone back through time and you've seen most horror films worth seeing, from the silents, to the gothic horror, either Euro or Hammer, to the giallo genre, through the golden age of horror in the 1970s-80s and you have tried virtually all horror available on  Nflix instant, then there is a good chance our tastes may converge. I, personally, look forward to other films by the director.",4,Worth it!

Wow, this director either has no experience or is just plain bad at directing. I believe he is also the writer, which doesn't surprise me. I don't want to attack but there just wasn't anything here. Period. The film begins with an excruciatingly long and boring tour of the house by our antagonist, maybe he was interested in buying, who knows cause nothing is ever explained in this movie....ever. Then comes the even more boring and pointless return of our victims who meander around their own house, unaware of the &#34;terror&#34; that awaits. in a very bland way that leaves little for the audience to connect with. Just a couple of hapless characters with no background or development, like the rest of the movie. About 45 minutes in, something finally happens. The masked intruder strikes!!! Who cares? Why is he there? Is there some connection to the victims? If not, can we at least have some background as to why this is happening? Please? Then there is a lot of idiotic moves used by the female victim (apparently being in safe spots is not her strong suit), which leads to the TWIST ending.....which isn't even a twist at all, since there are only four characters in the movie, two of which are being victimized right in front of our eyes and the other is not a huge tall male so it's more of a &#34;duh, saw that coming&#34;......but why???? I don't think I have ever seen a more plot-less movie in my life. It took so long to get started, and when it finally did, it still felt like it didn't, because nothing made sense. I tried hard to go the motiveless serial killer route as the reason, but even with that this movie is still a big huge pile of nothing. I would recommend others thinking of watching this to steer clear of this one",2,And the point....or I mean plot???,1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,1861,"['went', 'preconceived', 'opinions', 'expectations', 'feel', 'best', 'way', 'go', 'film', 'Wow', 'director', 'experience', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'directing', 'believe', 'also', 'writer', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'attack', 'there', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'here', 'Period', 'film', 'excruciatingly', 'long', 'boring', 'tour', 'house', 'antagonist', 'maybe', 'was', 'interested', 'buying', 'who', 'cause', 'nothing', 'ever', 'explained', 'movie', '.ever', 'Then', 'even', 'more', 'boring', 'pointless', 'return', 'victims', 'who', 'meander', 'own', 'house', 'unaware', '34', 'terror', '34', 'very', 'bland', 'way', 'little', 'audience', 'connect', 'Just', 'couple', 'hapless', 'characters', 'background', 'development', 'rest', 'movie', '45', 'minutes', 'something', 'finally', 'masked', 'intruder', 'strikes', 'Who', 'Why', 'there', 'there', 'connection', 'victims', 'not', 'can', 'least', 'have', 'background', 'why', 'happening', 'Please', 'Then', 'lot', 'idiotic', 'moves', 'used', 'female', 'victim', 'apparently', 'being', 'safe', 'spots', 'not', 'strong', 'suit', 'TWIST', 'ending', '..which', ""n't"", 'even', 'twist', 'are', 'only', 'four', 'characters', 'movie', 'two', 'are', 'being', 'victimized', 'right', 'front', 'eyes', 'other', 'not', 'huge', 'tall', 'male', 'more', '34', 'duh', 'saw', 'coming', '34', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'more', 'plot-less', 'movie', 'life', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'get', 'started', 'when', 'finally', 'did', 'still', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'nothing', 'made', 'sense', 'tried', 'hard', 'go', 'motiveless', 'serial', 'killer', 'route', 'reason', 'even', 'movie', 'still', 'big', 'huge', 'pile', 'nothing', 'would', 'recommend', 'others', 'thinking', 'watching', 'steer', 'clear', 'one']",N/A

Excruciatingly awful ""thriller"" about a psycho with a suspiciously involved knowledge of forensic evidence who traps a couple in their home and terrorizes and kills them.  This thing is seriously bad.  Writer director David Morlet has so few ideas that his movie runs less than 80 minutes long without credits and it takes more than 30 minutes for the killer to actually encounter his first victim.  The filmmaker obviously thought he was building up tension in the early scenes but the reality is that he made a movie that is almost unbearably boring.  Unfortunately things don't pick up much once the mayhem actually begins.  Morlet apparently saw no value in keeping the husband alive so that character is killed off almost immediately, leaving only the wife to terrorize.  But his killer doesn't really seem to have much of an idea of what to do with her, either.  She escapes fairly quickly and then, in typical bad horror movie fashion, proceeds to do one idiotic thing after another.  Rather than a cat and mouse game between killer and potential victim it feels like the characters are trying to stay away from each other to pad out the already slim running time.  Whenever Home Sweet Home threatens to actually become entertaining or suspenseful the filmmakers find a way to screw it up.

If I can spare one poor soul from wasting their time watching this film I would be very happy. The first 45 minutes shows the killer sauntering casually, very s-l-o-w-l-y around the house he has invaded.  The director is apparently in love with slow, languishing moments because there are far, far too many of them. The film consists of very few actual scenes. The scenes presumably were sacrificed so the director could slowly pan and make his actors hold one moment and stay in it.  If you squirm at all it will be from irritation.  The wife/victim issues hiccupy little sobs and wanders into the killer's arms TWICE. She never tries to break the glass out of a window to escape.  If a masked man is in your home you can probably assume he is going to do terrible things to you and will more than likely kill you.
