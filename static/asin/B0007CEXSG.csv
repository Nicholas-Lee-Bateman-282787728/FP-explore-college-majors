879599,A3J0AQUK0I4C60,B0007CEXSG,Linny,"[0, 0]","Love this story between Rich and Gloria. The romance is sweet, kind of like a fantasy.  Rich is the Stanford-educated son of a New York congressman who endeavors to be a cowboy. So he partners up with Panhandle Phillips. In the interim he meets Gloria, falls in love and marries her. The friendship between the two male characters adds more fun. Especially, since Panhandle is jealous of Gloria and is constantly putting her down.",5,Nothing Too Good for a Cowboy,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,430,"['Love', 'story', 'Rich', 'Gloria', 'romance', 'sweet', 'kind', 'fantasy', 'Rich', 'Stanford-educated', 'son', 'New', 'York', 'congressman', 'who', 'be', 'cowboy', 'partners', 'up', 'Panhandle', 'Phillips', 'interim', 'Gloria', 'love', 'friendship', 'two', 'male', 'characters', 'more', 'fun', 'Especially', 'Panhandle', 'jealous', 'Gloria', 'constantly', 'putting', 'down']",N/A

879602,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B0007CEXSG,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[28, 28]","Cute is the right word for this made-for-TV movie. A cute meet involving runaway horses and a social gathering at a Vancouver country club leads to a quick marriage, and the rest of the film concerns itself with (a) whether the cowboy hero's city-bred wife has what it takes for an early-winter cattle drive, and (b) whether the ranch's investors and a greedy banker are prevented from putting the ranch out of business. Needless to say, all ends well, and Ryan Gosling fans will not be dissapointed either, but any resemblance to actual cattle ranching is coincidental. I can also mention that scenic footage of this particularly breathtaking part of the world (the mountains of central British Columbia) is in short supply.Hobson's book about himself as a young rancher in the late 1930s in BC is wonderfully written, with a chilling account of that cattle drive under severe blizzard conditions. There is a wider array of characters, including members of a local tribe of Indians, and his buddy Panhandle is given more to do than simply object to the presence of a woman on the trail. Hobson's courtship and marriage, in fact, don't happen until the end of the book. Read it; you'll enjoy it.",3,"Cute movie, but read the book . . .",1181692800,"06 13, 2007",2007,1195,"['Cute', 'right', 'word', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'cute', 'meet', 'involving', 'runaway', 'horses', 'social', 'gathering', 'Vancouver', 'country', 'club', 'quick', 'marriage', 'rest', 'film', 'concerns', 'cowboy', 'hero', 'city-bred', 'wife', 'what', 'early-winter', 'cattle', 'drive', 'b', 'ranch', 'investors', 'greedy', 'banker', 'are', 'prevented', 'putting', 'ranch', 'business', 'Needless', 'say', 'ends', 'well', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'fans', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'dissapointed', 'either', 'resemblance', 'actual', 'cattle', 'ranching', 'coincidental', 'can', 'also', 'mention', 'scenic', 'footage', 'particularly', 'breathtaking', 'part', 'world', 'mountains', 'central', 'British', 'Columbia', 'short', 'supply.Hobson', 'book', 'about', 'young', 'rancher', 'late', '1930s', 'BC', 'wonderfully', 'written', 'chilling', 'account', 'cattle', 'drive', 'severe', 'blizzard', 'conditions', 'wider', 'array', 'characters', 'including', 'members', 'local', 'tribe', 'Indians', 'buddy', 'Panhandle', 'given', 'more', 'do', 'simply', 'object', 'presence', 'woman', 'trail', 'Hobson', 'courtship', 'marriage', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'happen', 'end', 'book', 'Read', ""'ll"", 'enjoy']",N/A
