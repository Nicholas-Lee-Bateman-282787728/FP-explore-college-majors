1072595,A3M1EKSN23SVOJ,B000PMGS5E,"DICK YORK IS THE BETTER DICK ""Sterculeus Erectus""","[32, 34]","I know a lot about this series.  First, this DVD set is a re-mastered digitally enhanced edition of uncut (MINUS previews to next week that originally aired!!) 50 minute episodes. That is the good news. The bad news. Where is the original PILOT movie called tHE ROOKIES that ran 74 minutes (no commercials) and featured the same cast (minus Kate Jackson and Gerald S.)' Loughlin) and featured Darren Mcgavin? It introduced the series and truly was a ""pilot"". Shame on SONY DVD. Also ""missing"" are the orignal bumpers that aired during eaach episode featuring a Police Siren ""The Rookies will continue after Station identifaction"" and all the previews to next weeks shows. There was a 60 second preview to next weeks show at the end of every episode aired on ABC in the 70's. All are missing on the DVD release.Here is some information on the series many  may not know. Getting the rest of this series released on home DVD might take..YEARS(  aND IT TURNS OUT I AM RIGHT AS OF JULY 2011..IT IS TAKING years!)  Season Two has an issue--  One episode--titled FROZEN SMOKE stars John Travolta and for years he kept the episode out of syndication and it was never aired for over 25 years until TV land did a once through run of PART of the series several years ago. They STOPPED airing episodes 1/3 throught the second season and no one else airs the series. If we do not get them on home dvd--we cannot get them.  It is still possible the Travolta episode is a stumbling block for relase of Season 2 to DVD...if it is so much an issue with residual payments to Travolta. just leave it off. I would take Season 2 minus ONE episode if there is a good reason a deal could not be worked out. This way we have no Season 2 or 3 , etc.More disturbing news--the original Pilot to the series SWAT-- a TWO hour episode of THE ROOKIES aired as BOTH a ROOKIES/SWAT cross over episdoe ONLY ONCE in  March 1975 during the third season of The Rookies. The episode was NEVER syndicated to reruns with SWAT OR The ROOKIES and is NOT available on the SWAT first Season DVD set (That's right---the first episode of SWAT on home DVD--is really episode TWO!) Even more disturbing, The ROOKIES was the FIRST TV series to feature what is knownas ""BLOOD SQUIBS"". That is, when people are shot, they BLEED. You don't SEE people bleed a lot when they are shot on almost ALL TV series. Its considering ""a no no"" (CBS ""frowns"" on impact shots, NBC always does not like them, and ABC virtually doesn't air any impact shots)  You can fire a gun at someone but you need to be 'tasteful' and HIDE the blood on network TV. (Just watch all the old westerns and watch as people clutch at their shoulders or hold a hand over the wound so you can not see blood)On THE ROOKIES, since it was fresh and a new technology and it was the time of DIRTY HARRY!, they used Blood squibs in the ORIGINAL network versions on ABC TV. When they syndicated the show to VIACOM in the late 70's, 98% (that's almost ALL) of the gunshots and ALL of the blood SQUIB impact shots were REMOVED from the prints for TV, That's right--any print shown in syndication from 1977 to 2002 was a VIACOM print with edited violence. Some episodes were so badly edited they clocked in at  less than 43 minutes out of 50 minutes and othes made no sense with the 'action/gunshots"" cut out. It was done for marketing reasons so the show could be shown at ANY hour but it made the series virtually unwatchable and UNCUT episodes a  VERY RARE COMMODITY! The series was sent out PRE CUT on low quality vidoetape in the late 70's through the end of the Viacom owned period early 2002. It was only during the ONE airing of Season 1 and the first third of Season 2 on TV LAND where we saw newly remastered SONY prints with uncut violence. But the epsiodes were edited for time by 5 minutes and they stopped airing the show after only 33 episodes were aired.SO I anxiously await the release of Seasons two, three and four on DVD. Will they ever be released? And will they include the SWAT 2 hour pilot, FROZEN SMOKE starring John Travolta and THE ROOKIES PILOT MOVIE?UPDATE:It is July 2011 and Season 2 of The Rookies has yet to come to DVD. Just about everything else you could want has found its way to DVD...except the rest of The Rookies, Season 2 of SWAT, and Season 3-5 of TJ HOOKER--all of which are owned by SONY. Why won;t Sony release the shows to DVD? if they won;t release them, why won't they let another DVD company buy the rights and release them? This is quite unfair releasing only ONE season and then stopping.",3,WHERE IS THE PILOT film THE ROOKIES?,1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,4543,"['know', 'lot', 'series', 'First', 'DVD', 'set', 're-mastered', 'digitally', 'enhanced', 'edition', 'uncut', 'MINUS', 'next', 'week', 'originally', 'aired', '50', 'minute', 'episodes', 'good', 'news', 'bad', 'news', 'Where', 'original', 'PILOT', 'movie', 'called', 'tHE', 'ROOKIES', 'ran', '74', 'minutes', 'commercials', 'featured', 'same', 'cast', 'minus', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'Gerald', 'S.', 'Loughlin', 'featured', 'Darren', 'Mcgavin', 'introduced', 'series', 'truly', 'was', 'pilot', 'Shame', 'SONY', 'DVD', 'Also', 'missing', 'are', 'orignal', 'bumpers', 'aired', 'eaach', 'episode', 'featuring', 'Police', 'Siren', 'Rookies', 'will', 'continue', 'Station', 'identifaction', 'previews', 'next', 'weeks', 'was', '60', 'second', 'preview', 'next', 'weeks', 'show', 'end', 'episode', 'aired', 'ABC', '70', 'are', 'missing', 'DVD', 'release.Here', 'information', 'series', 'many', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'Getting', 'rest', 'series', 'released', 'home', 'DVD', 'might', 'take..YEARS', 'IT', 'TURNS', 'OUT', 'AM', 'RIGHT', 'OF', 'JULY', '2011..IT', 'IS', 'TAKING', 'years', 'Season', 'Two', 'issue', 'One', 'episode', 'titled', 'FROZEN', 'SMOKE', 'John', 'Travolta', 'years', 'kept', 'episode', 'syndication', 'was', 'never', 'aired', '25', 'years', 'TV', 'land', 'did', 'once', 'run', 'PART', 'series', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'STOPPED', 'airing', 'episodes', '1/3', 'throught', 'second', 'season', 'one', 'else', 'series', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'home', 'dvd', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'still', 'possible', 'Travolta', 'episode', 'stumbling', 'block', 'relase', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'so', 'much', 'issue', 'residual', 'payments', 'Travolta', 'just', 'leave', 'off', 'would', 'take', 'Season', '2', 'ONE', 'episode', 'good', 'reason', 'deal', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'worked', 'out', 'way', 'have', 'Season', '2', '3', 'etc.More', 'disturbing', 'news', 'original', 'Pilot', 'series', 'SWAT', 'TWO', 'hour', 'episode', 'THE', 'ROOKIES', 'aired', 'BOTH', 'ROOKIES/SWAT', 'cross', 'episdoe', 'ONLY', 'ONCE', 'March', '1975', 'third', 'season', 'Rookies', 'episode', 'was', 'NEVER', 'syndicated', 'reruns', 'SWAT', 'OR', 'ROOKIES', 'NOT', 'available', 'SWAT', 'first', 'Season', 'DVD', 'set', 'right', '-the', 'first', 'episode', 'SWAT', 'home', 'DVD', 'really', 'episode', 'TWO', 'Even', 'more', 'disturbing', 'ROOKIES', 'was', 'FIRST', 'TV', 'series', 'feature', 'what', 'knownas', 'BLOOD', 'SQUIBS', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'shot', 'BLEED', 'do', ""n't"", 'SEE', 'people', 'bleed', 'lot', 'when', 'are', 'shot', 'almost', 'ALL', 'TV', 'series', 'considering', 'CBS', 'frowns', 'impact', 'shots', 'NBC', 'always', 'not', 'like', 'ABC', 'virtually', ""n't"", 'air', 'impact', 'shots', 'can', 'fire', 'gun', 'someone', 'need', 'be', ""'tasteful"", 'HIDE', 'blood', 'network', 'TV', 'Just', 'watch', 'old', 'westerns', 'watch', 'people', 'clutch', 'shoulders', 'hold', 'hand', 'wound', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'blood', 'THE', 'ROOKIES', 'was', 'fresh', 'new', 'technology', 'was', 'time', 'DIRTY', 'HARRY', 'used', 'Blood', 'squibs', 'ORIGINAL', 'network', 'versions', 'ABC', 'TV', 'When', 'syndicated', 'show', 'VIACOM', 'late', '70', '98', '%', 'almost', 'ALL', 'gunshots', 'ALL', 'blood', 'SQUIB', 'impact', 'shots', 'were', 'REMOVED', 'prints', 'TV', 'right', 'print', 'shown', 'syndication', '1977', '2002', 'was', 'VIACOM', 'print', 'edited', 'violence', 'episodes', 'were', 'so', 'badly', 'edited', 'clocked', 'less', '43', 'minutes', '50', 'minutes', 'othes', 'made', 'sense', ""'action/gunshots"", 'cut', 'out', 'was', 'done', 'marketing', 'reasons', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'shown', 'ANY', 'hour', 'made', 'series', 'virtually', 'unwatchable', 'UNCUT', 'VERY', 'RARE', 'COMMODITY', 'series', 'was', 'sent', 'out', 'PRE', 'CUT', 'low', 'quality', 'vidoetape', 'late', '70', 'end', 'Viacom', 'owned', 'period', 'early', '2002', 'was', 'only', 'ONE', 'airing', 'Season', '1', 'first', 'third', 'Season', '2', 'TV', 'LAND', 'where', 'saw', 'newly', 'remastered', 'SONY', 'prints', 'uncut', 'violence', 'epsiodes', 'were', 'edited', 'time', '5', 'minutes', 'stopped', 'airing', 'show', 'only', '33', 'episodes', 'were', 'aired.SO', 'anxiously', 'await', 'release', 'Seasons', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'DVD', 'Will', 'ever', 'be', 'released', 'will', 'include', 'SWAT', '2', 'hour', 'pilot', 'FROZEN', 'SMOKE', 'starring', 'John', 'Travolta', 'THE', 'ROOKIES', 'PILOT', 'MOVIE', 'UPDATE', 'July', '2011', 'Season', '2', 'Rookies', 'yet', 'come', 'DVD', 'Just', 'everything', 'else', 'could', 'want', 'found', 'way', 'DVD', 'rest', 'Rookies', 'Season', '2', 'SWAT', 'Season', '3-5', 'TJ', 'HOOKER', 'are', 'owned', 'SONY', 'Why', 'won', 't', 'Sony', 'release', 'shows', 'DVD', 'won', 't', 'release', 'why', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'DVD', 'company', 'buy', 'rights', 'release', 'quite', 'unfair', 'releasing', 'only', 'ONE', 'season', 'then', 'stopping']",N/A

1072601,A1N8WMNX7KV2GE,B000PMGS5E,Judith Molly,"[5, 7]","First, the DVD.This would have been an excellent show to have a few extras along with it! I suppose that we can't have everything. There's something that I'm extremely glad that wasn't done and unfortunately because of greed is becoming very popular. I'm glad that it was decided not to put one half of season 1 on one DVD set and the second half on another DVD set like was done with Perry Mason, The Untouchachables, and others.Now, the show itself. I'm sure that police procedures here in the 2000's hardly resemble to a great degree police procedures from the 1970's. I'm reasonably sure that police procedures from the 1970's didn't resemble, to a great degree, the police procedures from ""The Rookies"". After all, it was a TV show designed for entertainment to include, besides fast paced music, almost every program haveing officers climbing buildings, jumping fences, etc. Sure, those things occured within every major city within the United States in the 1970's, and some smaller towns, however, not to the degree that they occured on ""The Rookies"". Haveing said all of that, I watched the program every week from 1972 through 1976 for just such elements because they entertained me. Also, I watched it because the shows were well written. The only thing that I might complain about pertaining to how well the shows were written is the fact that it really didn't looked very obvious to me that Jill and Mike were married. One of the reasons that I love old television shows is that there was no gratuitous sex. However, within ""The Rookies"", there's hardly a ""Hi, Honey"" between those two or even a very quick kiss. Sure, from time to time she's referred to as Mrs. Danko, but that's about it. Come on Mike, give her a ""Hi Honey"" and a smooch once in awhile!Overall, the DVD needs a few extras, I'm glad that the set includes the entire  1st season, there's lot's of action that keeps me entertained, and except for what I said about Mike and Jill, it was very well written!",5,No Extras-Too Bad!

1072607,A3BMRSE8N1858V,B000PMGS5E,Terence Allen,"[35, 37]","Aaron Spelling was in the beginning of his reign as ABC's personal hit-producer, having already contributed ""The Mod Squad,"" when this show first aired in 1972. This show contributed to a era of cop shows that were as light and fluffy in content as they were heavy in pyrotechnic action.""The Rookies"" were a trio of newly-minted uniform patrolmen in a California police department. Terry Webster was a serious intellectual who had been a social protester, but decided he could make real change by patrolling the beat. Mike Danko was a serious minded ex military man married to a nurse, and Willie Gillis was a fun-loving college grad. Under the tutelage of their squad commander, Lt. Ryker, the three cops learned the ropes and how to take the bad guys off the streets.Georg Stanford Brown played Webster with authority. Sam Melville, a veteran character actor, played Danko as a sober, but compassionate cop woh dearly loved his wife (played by Spelling's future Charlie's Angel Kate Jackson), and Michael Ontkean was the silly one, making jokes and always looking at things from a humorous perspective. (Ontkean would leave the series and be replaced by a different character played by Bruce Fairbairn in subsequent seasons). And Gerald S. O'Loughlin was marvelous as Lt. Ryker, a serious, almost unemotional superior who actually had a great sense of humor and was genuinely caring and concerned about his young charges.This show wasn't going to set a high bar for plotting or originality, but it was well-written and well acted. It was entertaining and worth watching. And it continued to pave the way for Spelling's many other cop/detective dramas, including ""SWAT,"" ""Starsky and Hutch,"" ""Vegas,"" ""Hart to Hart,"" ""Charlie's Angels,"" ""TJ Hooker,"" and ""Matt Houston.""

1072608,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000PMGS5E,trebe,"[0, 0]","In the 70's, executive producers Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg teamed to produce a string of huge primetime hits for ABC.  The list includes, Charlie's Angels, Fantasy Island, The Love Boat, Starsky and Hutch, and Family.  Created by Rita Lakin (Gladdy Gold mystery books), The Rookies was one of Spelling/Goldberg's earlier efforts, and was probably familiar ground for Spelling, who had recently had a major success with The Mod Squad, another police drama with three young stars.The Rookies are police officers Terry Webster (Georg Stanford Brown), Mike Danko (Sam Melville) and Willie Gillis (Michael Ontkean).  Serving on the Southern California Police Force, they are supervised by their watch commander Lieutenant Eddie Ryker (Gerald S. O'Laughlin).  Webster and Gillis are partners, and also share and apartment.  Danko is ex-Air Force, and married.  His wife Jill is a nurse, and played by future Charlie's Angel, Kate Jackson.  With a youthful cast, the hope was that The Rookies, like The Mod Squad, would appeal to a younger demographic than programs like McCloud, or Ironside.The relationships between the central characters, is the strength of the program.  The focus is often on partners Webster and Gillis.  The streetwise Webster is prone to anger against what he sees as the injustice of society.  Gillis is thoughtful and sensitive, and sometimes in situations that cause him to question himself.  Without a steady partner, Pete Danko is often the odd man out.  Being older, married, and more level headed, also separates Danko from the other two.  People are frequently in need of medical attention, providing ample opportunities to feature Jill at the hospital.  Lt. Ryker is sometimes stiffer than cardboard, but he is the steadying force in the middle of the , tragedy, and drama.Typical for crime shows of the time, the amount of action and level of violence is quite high, often excessive, with realism and credibility often secondary to generating the action, or just ignored altogether.  Although there is a steady diet of gun battles, chases, fights, murders, assaults, gratuitous violence, and drug related crime, many times there isn't a logical intelligent story behind the mayhem.  To be fair, there is marked improvement in the level of the writing by season's end, and a good variety in the stories.Episodes featuring a character in crisis include `The Bear That Didn't Get Up' where Gillis believes that he has shot and killed a student, and `A Bloody Shade of Blue' where Webster is blinded, and befriended by a nurse with some hang-ups.  There are times when things go way over the top, and then fly over a cliff as in `Three Hours to Kill' when a man's wife and an accomplice enter an operating room and hold a patient and the operating staff hostage, in order to try and get the woman's husband released from prison.  Interesting and provocative, `A Farewell Tree from Marly' features Tyne Daly (then married to Georg Stanford Brown), as a mentally retarded witness to a crime.  `Crossfire' is another provocative tale, involving an African-American officer (Percy Rodrigues) who clashes philosophical swords with Webster.  And it is old school meets the `new breed of cop', in `Life Robbery', when Ryker's old friend needs some help dealing with a crime wave.Like many programs of this era, violence is emphasized over reality.  Some thirty-five plus years later, some of the stories may not hold up that well, but if 70's cop shows are your thing, The Rookies, with its strong cast, is certainly worth a look.",3,the new breed of cop . . .,1243987200,"06 3, 2009",2009,3556,"['70', 'executive', 'producers', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', 'Leonard', 'Goldberg', 'teamed', 'produce', 'string', 'huge', 'primetime', 'hits', 'ABC', 'list', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'Fantasy', 'Island', 'Love', 'Boat', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'Family', 'Created', 'Rita', 'Lakin', 'Gladdy', 'Gold', 'mystery', 'books', 'Rookies', 'was', 'one', 'Spelling/Goldberg', 'earlier', 'efforts', 'was', 'probably', 'familiar', 'ground', 'Spelling', 'who', 'had', 'recently', 'had', 'major', 'success', 'Mod', 'Squad', 'police', 'drama', 'three', 'young', 'stars.The', 'Rookies', 'are', 'police', 'officers', 'Terry', 'Webster', 'Georg', 'Stanford', 'Brown', 'Mike', 'Danko', 'Sam', 'Melville', 'Willie', 'Gillis', 'Michael', 'Ontkean', 'Serving', 'Southern', 'California', 'Police', 'Force', 'are', 'supervised', 'watch', 'commander', 'Lieutenant', 'Eddie', 'Ryker', 'Gerald', 'S.', ""O'Laughlin"", 'Webster', 'Gillis', 'are', 'partners', 'also', 'share', 'apartment', 'Danko', 'ex-Air', 'Force', 'married', 'wife', 'Jill', 'nurse', 'played', 'future', 'Charlie', 'Angel', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'youthful', 'cast', 'hope', 'was', 'Rookies', 'Mod', 'Squad', 'would', 'appeal', 'younger', 'demographic', 'programs', 'McCloud', 'Ironside.The', 'relationships', 'central', 'characters', 'strength', 'program', 'focus', 'often', 'partners', 'Webster', 'Gillis', 'streetwise', 'Webster', 'prone', 'anger', 'what', 'injustice', 'society', 'Gillis', 'thoughtful', 'sensitive', 'sometimes', 'situations', 'cause', 'question', 'steady', 'partner', 'Pete', 'Danko', 'often', 'odd', 'man', 'out', 'Being', 'older', 'married', 'more', 'level', 'headed', 'also', 'Danko', 'other', 'two', 'People', 'are', 'frequently', 'need', 'medical', 'attention', 'providing', 'ample', 'opportunities', 'feature', 'Jill', 'hospital', 'Lt.', 'Ryker', 'sometimes', 'stiffer', 'cardboard', 'steadying', 'force', 'middle', 'tragedy', 'drama.Typical', 'crime', 'shows', 'time', 'amount', 'action', 'level', 'violence', 'quite', 'high', 'often', 'excessive', 'realism', 'credibility', 'often', 'secondary', 'generating', 'action', 'just', 'ignored', 'altogether', 'steady', 'diet', 'gun', 'battles', 'chases', 'fights', 'murders', 'assaults', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'drug', 'related', 'crime', 'many', 'times', ""n't"", 'logical', 'intelligent', 'story', 'mayhem', 'be', 'fair', 'marked', 'improvement', 'level', 'writing', 'season', 'end', 'good', 'variety', 'stories.Episodes', 'featuring', 'character', 'crisis', 'include', 'Bear', 'That', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Get', 'Up', 'where', 'Gillis', 'shot', 'killed', 'student', 'Bloody', 'Shade', 'Blue', 'where', 'Webster', 'blinded', 'befriended', 'nurse', 'hang-ups', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'things', 'go', 'way', 'top', 'then', 'fly', 'cliff', 'Three', 'Hours', 'Kill', 'when', 'man', 'wife', 'accomplice', 'enter', 'operating', 'room', 'hold', 'patient', 'operating', 'staff', 'hostage', 'order', 'try', 'get', 'woman', 'husband', 'released', 'prison', 'Interesting', 'provocative', 'Farewell', 'Tree', 'Marly', 'features', 'Tyne', 'Daly', 'then', 'married', 'Georg', 'Stanford', 'Brown', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'witness', 'crime', 'Crossfire', 'provocative', 'tale', 'involving', 'African-American', 'officer', 'Percy', 'Rodrigues', 'who', 'philosophical', 'swords', 'Webster', 'old', 'school', 'new', 'breed', 'cop', 'Life', 'Robbery', 'when', 'Ryker', 'old', 'friend', 'help', 'dealing', 'crime', 'many', 'programs', 'era', 'violence', 'emphasized', 'reality', 'thirty-five', 'years', 'later', 'stories', 'may', 'not', 'hold', 'up', 'well', '70', 'cop', 'shows', 'are', 'thing', 'Rookies', 'strong', 'cast', 'certainly', 'worth', 'look']",N/A
