The only film based upon his plays that Netflix streaming offered was this, so we chose it. And enjoyed it immensely. I think it would be a dry and exasperating play to read, but in the hands of two masters, Duvall and Jones, and a surprisingly effective kid, wow, what a treat. This is the story of an unhappy man losing his mind, and the oppressed, distressed and outguessed people around him, wondering why they are dependent upon him, and how their futures will shake out after his death.Nothing startling, nothing exhilarating, just a tender tale beautifully photographed, with utterly astonishing acting. Duvall is amazing...he imbues this irritable and cantankerous grump with just enough humor and sparkle to make us like him despite his enormous offensiveness. And Jones is better here than in anything else I've seen. Understated and powerful, convincing and delightful. And the rest of the cast works perfectly.

Part of Horton Foote's cycle of nine plays featuring a character, Horace, much like his own father, ""Convicts"" is of a different temper from his more bittersweet scripts (""Tender Mercies,"" ""The Trip to Bountiful""). Here the violence and brutality of the Old South is portrayed in a remote rural setting along the Texas Gulf coast on a convict farm, where the workers are no better than slaves, and though it is 1902, the Civil War seems still in the recent past.Duvall is Soll, the owner, raving, confused, forgetful, paranoid. His scenes with his employees, Ben (James Earl Jones), 13-year old Horace (Lukas Haas), Martha (Starletta Depois), and a trustie Jackson (Mel Winkler) are rambling, circuitous and full of repetitions and questions with ""I don't know"" answers. It's a Faulkner story retold by Samuel Beckett. While there is much talk of death, dying, and killing, there are also moments of comic absurdity. Viewers eager for plot and action will be impatient with the theatricality of the dialogue and the scenes, but that's not what the film is about. They are all convicts, trapped in a dying world and going nowhere. Only the young Horace, with his education, his intelligence and humanity, and his knowledge of a modern world elsewhere will escape.",4,No escape . . .,1216771200,"07 23, 2008",2008,1421,"['Robert', 'Duvall', 'who', 'was', '58', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', '1990', 'King', 'Lear-like', 'old', 'tyrant', '80s', 'more', 'half-demented', 'half-drunk', 'fully', 'armed', 'Part', 'Horton', 'Foote', 'cycle', 'nine', 'plays', 'featuring', 'character', 'Horace', 'much', 'own', 'father', 'Convicts', 'different', 'temper', 'more', 'bittersweet', 'scripts', 'Tender', 'Mercies', 'Trip', 'Bountiful', 'Here', 'violence', 'brutality', 'Old', 'South', 'portrayed', 'remote', 'rural', 'setting', 'Texas', 'Gulf', 'coast', 'convict', 'farm', 'where', 'workers', 'are', 'better', 'slaves', '1902', 'Civil', 'War', 'still', 'recent', 'past.Duvall', 'Soll', 'owner', 'raving', 'confused', 'forgetful', 'paranoid', 'scenes', 'employees', 'Ben', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', '13-year', 'old', 'Horace', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'Martha', 'Starletta', 'Depois', 'trustie', 'Jackson', 'Mel', 'Winkler', 'are', 'rambling', 'circuitous', 'full', 'repetitions', 'questions', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'answers', 'Faulkner', 'story', 'retold', 'Samuel', 'Beckett', 'much', 'talk', 'death', 'dying', 'killing', 'are', 'also', 'moments', 'comic', 'absurdity', 'Viewers', 'eager', 'plot', 'action', 'will', 'be', 'impatient', 'theatricality', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'not', 'what', 'film', 'about', 'are', 'convicts', 'trapped', 'dying', 'world', 'going', 'nowhere', 'Only', 'young', 'Horace', 'education', 'intelligence', 'humanity', 'knowledge', 'modern', 'world', 'elsewhere', 'will', 'escape']",N/A
