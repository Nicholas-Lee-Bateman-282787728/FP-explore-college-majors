It also offers Buffy and Cordelia as cheerleaders, a direction too reminiscent of the original Buffy movie that Joss Whedon wisely abandons.  &quot;Never Kill a Boy on the First Date&quot; is a below average Buffy episode with a pretty good title.  Four stars for &quot;Witch&quot; and three for &quot;Never Kill...&quot; rounded up to a four overall.

449171,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6305119112,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 6]","This second tape from the first season collection of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; includes a pair of episodes that are only tangentially important to the Buffy mythos.  In &quot;The Witch&quot; we meet Amy Madison, who is currently known to Buffy viewers as Willow's pet white rat.  However, at this point she is just another girl trying out for the Sunnydale High Cheerleading squad along with Buffy and Cordelia.  This is one of those early episodes that does acknowledge the original feature film as background for the series.  Of course this is Sunnydale, so we are not surprised when one of the girls spontaneously bursts into flames during the tryouts.  Eventually our attention is drawn to Amy, who is pretty uncoordinated but whose mother really, really, REALLY wants her to be on the sqaud.  Every time something bad happens to another one of the girls, Buffy and Amy move up the ladder of cheerleading success.  &quot;The Witch&quot; is--surprise, surprise--the episode that introduces the occult into the Buffy universe, which has major implications for Willow down the road.  Written by Dana Reston, it is clearly the stronger of the two episodes on this particular tape.&quot;Never Kill A Boy On The First Date&quot; does have a marvelous moment where Buffy goes after the bad guy screaming, &quot;You killed my date!&quot;  Remember the sub-text for Buffy is that High School is Hell for children, so here we have Buffy trying to at least pretend she is a normal student and actually go out on a normal date.  Just wait until Owen finds out what &quot;normal&quot; means in the wonderful and wacky world of Buffy.  The Master's attempt to use the Anointed One&quot; to kill the Slayer is the major sub-plot in this episode, which is far and away the weakest of the six included in this boxed set.  The amazingmrkimble is right: &quot;Prophecy Girl&quot; should have been included in this set.&quot;  The bottom line is that if you want this tape you should pick up the entire gift set.",4,Is Amy a good witch or a bad witch?

449172,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,6305119112,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[5, 6]","Looking back at the earliest 'Buffy' episodes, it's always hard not to get at least a little bit nostalgic.  These two episodes are stand-alone ones, not really anything to do with the main story arc.  That doesn't mean to say that they're not wonderful fun though.  In a way, it's these episodes just as much as the big ones that make it.  In these earlier years, the show was new and exciting.  It's blend of action with drama and comedy made it a slow but undeniable hit with British and American audiences.'Witch' sees the introduction of Amy Madison, who was later to feature prominently in episodes such as 'Bewitched, Bewildered and Beautiful' and 'Gingerbread'.  The supernatural intrigue story may seem old but it's the way it's told which makes 'Buffy' such a winner.  There's pop culture references which punctuate the punchy dialogue and some hilarious comedy made from Buffy's formidable strength as she throws one cheerleader across the room whilst trying out a new routine.In 'Never Kill A Boy On The First Date', the audience gets to meet shy quiet Owen who has a penchant for Emily Dickinson and Buffy.  Here a nightmare date brings a whole new quality to it, with the night ending at the Sunnydale Funeral Home.It's strange looking back because we know what's to come for the characters that we have grown to love.  We know the fates of Angel, Joyce and Buffy.  We know that shy retiring Willow becomes something else entirely.  In this the show has really broken all expectations.  It's managed to give its characters dimension without it appearing ludicrous.  Looking back only goes to show how much they've changed in not only a realistic but also a touching way.",5,Gothic fantasy at its best,1008460800,"12 16, 2001",2001,1684,"['Looking', 'back', 'earliest', ""'Buffy"", 'episodes', 'always', 'hard', 'not', 'get', 'least', 'little', 'bit', 'nostalgic', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'stand-alone', 'ones', 'not', 'really', 'anything', 'do', 'main', 'story', 'arc', ""n't"", 'mean', 'say', ""'re"", 'not', 'wonderful', 'fun', 'way', 'episodes', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'big', 'ones', 'make', 'earlier', 'years', 'show', 'was', 'new', 'exciting', 'blend', 'action', 'drama', 'comedy', 'made', 'slow', 'undeniable', 'hit', 'British', 'American', 'audiences', ""'Witch"", 'introduction', 'Amy', 'Madison', 'who', 'was', 'later', 'feature', 'prominently', 'episodes', 'such', ""'Bewitched"", 'Bewildered', 'Beautiful', 'supernatural', 'intrigue', 'story', 'may', 'seem', 'old', 'way', 'told', 'such', 'winner', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'punctuate', 'punchy', 'dialogue', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'made', 'Buffy', 'formidable', 'strength', 'one', 'cheerleader', 'room', 'whilst', 'trying', 'out', 'new', 'routine.In', 'Kill', 'A', 'Boy', 'First', 'Date', 'audience', 'meet', 'shy', 'quiet', 'Owen', 'who', 'penchant', 'Emily', 'Dickinson', 'Buffy', 'Here', 'nightmare', 'date', 'whole', 'new', 'quality', 'night', 'ending', 'Sunnydale', 'Funeral', 'Home.It', 'strange', 'looking', 'back', 'know', 'what', 'come', 'characters', 'have', 'grown', 'love', 'know', 'fates', 'Angel', 'Joyce', 'Buffy', 'know', 'shy', 'retiring', 'Willow', 'becomes', 'something', 'else', 'entirely', 'show', 'really', 'broken', 'expectations', 'managed', 'give', 'characters', 'dimension', 'appearing', 'ludicrous', 'Looking', 'back', 'only', 'show', 'how', 'much', ""'ve"", 'changed', 'not', 'only', 'realistic', 'also', 'touching', 'way']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Witch - Never Kill A Boy On The First Date VHS
449173,A10Q9341H2LYX0,6305119112,Shan Wickremesinghe,"[7, 7]","These are two season 1 episodes which early on sets out the intention of the show's creator, Joss Whedon. Even though the most common adversary faced is vampires and each series has an overall theme that is developed during the series in various episodes and a supervillain to be defeated by the end; he also wanted episodes that could stand alone and be a totally self contained story.Witch (Season 1 episode 3): Those who have seen the feature film would remember Buffy was a cheerleader. In this episode, she decides to give it another go and try out for the team in her new school. However, it becomes very quickly apparent that someone has it in for those trying out as they start to be struck blind, dumb and spontaneously combust. It's a very exciting episode and with a very good twist just everyone thinks they've worked it all out and quite an action packed finale in a race against the clock. This is a hallmark of the show, many episodes have surprises that come completely out of nowhere. Also, as part of the episode, the recurring characters are further developed with Xander in love with the oblivious Buffy, Willow in love with the oblivious Xander and Cordelia being set up as someone the group is going to continually cross swords with. These situations all come to a head in later episodes in season one and later seasons but this is the near the beginning of the various character's relationships. This is another attraction of the show, which progressively develops the characters over the course of several series even in a self contained episode like this one. Over time, all the characters have progressively changed and are quite different in ways but this is what they were like in the beginning.Never Kill a Boy on the First Date (Season 1 episode 5): This is an episode which ties into the overall theme of the series, that of Buffy's battle with The Master. However, it can be watched as a self-contained episode in its own right, not too much information is required. It also highlights another theme of the show, that of Buffy having to deal with the supernatural on the one hand and growing up, school and dating on the other and the difficulty of trying to keep the two separate.In this episode, Giles has a warning that a vampire warrior who can help The Master defeat Buffy and they have to try and stop him. Unfortunately the day in question co-incides with a date with the boy of the title, Owen, who has attracted her attention. At first there seems to be no problem with the aforementioned vampire being a no-show but then after thinking it is reasonable to go on a date as nothing is happening, well something happens which ends up with everyone at the Sunnydale Morgue (a place that sees a lot of business), Owen included and fighting for their lives. Then there's the added complication of not letting Owen finding out what's going on at the same time. Not surprisingly, there's a twist in it all.A good episode, only let down by the poor ending, where after the traumatic events inflicted on a key character in the episode; they come to a conclusion about their experience that is very, very unlikely under the circumstances and in fact you'd think the experience would have lead that character to come to exactly the opposite conclusion. In my opinion, the ending didn't work.Overall, two good episodes but there is actually an episode in between these two that was televised called&quot;Teacher's Pet&quot;. You can find out the order of episodes in each season by going to the official site and checking the &quot;Mortuary&quot; (where the past episode details are 'buried') section to see where in the scheme of things the episodes on video you are buying fit. It's very easy to find, simply the first name of the lead character of the show, a dot and then com. The fact there is an episode between these when buying the tapes is something you should be aware of.All twelve episodes of Season 1 are slated for release on DVD in 2001 in at least Zones 1,2 and 4 and now is as good a time as any to invest in a DVD player as Season 1 was one of the best (if not the best) seasons and the opportunity to get the whole series complete and with the quality DVD has to offer is quite appealing. Of course, there's future seasons of this show, the spin-off Angel, not to mention lots of other movies and TV shows that make a DVD player a good investment.However, two good episodes. Along with &quot;Welcome to the Hellmouth&quot; and &quot;The Harvest&quot; (Season 1 episodes 1&amp;2), that tape and this tape are a good introduction to the show",3,Sets the direction for the show,975974400,"12 5, 2000",2000,4587,"['are', 'two', 'season', '1', 'episodes', 'early', 'sets', 'out', 'intention', 'show', 'creator', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Even', 'most', 'common', 'adversary', 'faced', 'vampires', 'series', 'overall', 'theme', 'developed', 'series', 'various', 'episodes', 'supervillain', 'be', 'defeated', 'end', 'also', 'wanted', 'episodes', 'could', 'stand', 'alone', 'be', 'totally', 'self', 'contained', 'story.Witch', 'Season', '1', 'episode', '3', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'feature', 'film', 'would', 'remember', 'Buffy', 'was', 'cheerleader', 'episode', 'give', 'go', 'try', 'out', 'team', 'new', 'school', 'However', 'very', 'quickly', 'apparent', 'someone', 'trying', 'out', 'start', 'be', 'struck', 'blind', 'dumb', 'spontaneously', 'combust', 'very', 'exciting', 'episode', 'very', 'good', 'twist', 'just', 'everyone', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'out', 'quite', 'action', 'packed', 'finale', 'race', 'clock', 'hallmark', 'show', 'many', 'episodes', 'have', 'surprises', 'come', 'completely', 'nowhere', 'Also', 'part', 'episode', 'recurring', 'characters', 'are', 'further', 'developed', 'Xander', 'love', 'oblivious', 'Buffy', 'Willow', 'love', 'oblivious', 'Xander', 'Cordelia', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'someone', 'group', 'going', 'continually', 'cross', 'swords', 'situations', 'come', 'head', 'later', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'later', 'seasons', 'beginning', 'various', 'character', 'relationships', 'attraction', 'show', 'progressively', 'characters', 'course', 'several', 'series', 'even', 'self', 'contained', 'episode', 'one', 'time', 'characters', 'have', 'progressively', 'changed', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'ways', 'what', 'were', 'beginning.Never', 'Kill', 'Boy', 'First', 'Date', 'Season', '1', 'episode', '5', 'episode', 'overall', 'theme', 'series', 'Buffy', 'battle', 'Master', 'However', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'self-contained', 'episode', 'own', 'right', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'information', 'required', 'also', 'theme', 'show', 'Buffy', 'having', 'deal', 'supernatural', 'one', 'hand', 'growing', 'up', 'school', 'dating', 'other', 'difficulty', 'trying', 'keep', 'two', 'separate.In', 'episode', 'Giles', 'warning', 'vampire', 'warrior', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'Master', 'defeat', 'Buffy', 'have', 'try', 'stop', 'Unfortunately', 'day', 'question', 'co-incides', 'date', 'boy', 'title', 'Owen', 'who', 'attracted', 'attention', 'first', 'there', 'be', 'problem', 'aforementioned', 'vampire', 'being', 'no-show', 'then', 'thinking', 'reasonable', 'go', 'date', 'nothing', 'happening', 'well', 'something', 'happens', 'up', 'everyone', 'Sunnydale', 'Morgue', 'place', 'lot', 'business', 'Owen', 'included', 'fighting', 'lives', 'Then', 'added', 'complication', 'not', 'letting', 'Owen', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'same', 'time', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'twist', 'all.A', 'good', 'episode', 'only', 'let', 'down', 'poor', 'ending', 'where', 'traumatic', 'events', 'inflicted', 'key', 'character', 'episode', 'come', 'conclusion', 'experience', 'very', 'very', 'unlikely', 'circumstances', 'fact', ""'d"", 'think', 'experience', 'would', 'have', 'lead', 'character', 'come', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'conclusion', 'opinion', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'work.Overall', 'two', 'good', 'episodes', 'actually', 'episode', 'two', 'was', 'televised', 'called', 'quot', 'Teacher', 'Pet', 'quot', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'order', 'episodes', 'season', 'going', 'official', 'site', 'checking', 'quot', 'Mortuary', 'quot', 'where', 'past', 'episode', 'details', 'are', ""'buried"", 'section', 'see', 'where', 'scheme', 'things', 'episodes', 'video', 'are', 'buying', 'fit', 'very', 'easy', 'find', 'simply', 'first', 'name', 'lead', 'character', 'show', 'dot', 'then', 'com', 'fact', 'episode', 'when', 'buying', 'tapes', 'something', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'of.All', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'are', 'slated', 'release', 'DVD', '2001', 'least', '1,2', '4', 'now', 'as', 'good', 'time', 'invest', 'DVD', 'player', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'not', 'best', 'seasons', 'opportunity', 'get', 'whole', 'series', 'complete', 'quality', 'DVD', 'offer', 'quite', 'appealing', 'course', 'future', 'seasons', 'show', 'spin-off', 'Angel', 'not', 'mention', 'lots', 'other', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'make', 'DVD', 'player', 'good', 'investment.However', 'two', 'good', 'episodes', 'quot', 'Welcome', 'Hellmouth', 'quot', 'quot', 'Harvest', 'quot', 'Season', '1', 'episodes', '1', 'amp', '2', 'tape', 'tape', 'are', 'good', 'introduction', 'show']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Witch - Never Kill A Boy On The First Date VHS
