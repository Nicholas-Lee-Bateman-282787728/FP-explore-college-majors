149322,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,079284355X,Acute Observer,"[3, 16]","This film starts with an event based on a true crime. A talk radio show host in Denver was killed by an American Nazi. (This event inspired the ""Talk Radio"" play and film.) This film continues with scenes from a small town in a farming region. No mention of their economic status; are they losing dollars and population, small businesses, etc. Instead we see a small group of white racists who abduct a black man to hunt and kill him! This seems too exaggerated to believe. Federal agents are aware of this but don't want to act yet. Their agent is sent back to get more information. There are groups like that in some sparsely settled areas. The film doesn't explain what created them. It shows how some politicians try to use them for votes and contributions. No real names, of course.The Federal agent meets to report to her higher ups. Then we see terrorists prepare to hold up a bank to raise money for their activities (based on real events). Most bank robberies are done by ordinary criminals who are not part of any group. (The FBI put an end to organized gangs that robbed banks in the 1940s.) This Federal agency doesn't interfere because they want more information on their aims (and their leaders). More terrorism is planned: dynamiting a courthouse, attacking a power station, etc. The terrorist plots here would keep this small group busy 24 hours a day! Kathy finds a secret list of ""friends"". This is quickly copied with a camera. The Federal agents need to know who this group will target so they can arrest them. Gary meets with the leader (who arrives in a helicopter!) And shows documents that say Kathy is a special investigator. Is Kathy being served up as a sacrifice? Gary and Kathy travel to Chicago, where an assassination is planned that will make Gary the fall guy. (Another Lee Harvey Oswald?) A second ""lone gunman"" shoots the politician in front of a building. Gary fails to shoot, and won't ever try this again.Costa-Gavras gained world fame with his 1969 film ""Z"". A few years later his film about rebels in South America was popular. His later films have seemed mediocre. A better story might not have tried to cover so many details and plots as this film does; better pacing could help. The threat from domestic terrorism still needs a good film (e.g., Timothy McVeigh). Those who gave this film a high rating must love the images more than the facts.A better film today would show the bad results from ""NAFTA"" and ""Free Trade"" in harming most Americans economically. But Hollywood would never allow a film about this ""war on the middle class"". The word `nafta' in Greek and Arabic refers to `petroleum'. NAFTA is a symbol for the policies designed for Big Oil.

Bush calling his policy ""Operation Iraqi Liberation"".",1,Drama About Domestic Terrorists,1165622400,"12 9, 2006",2006,2771,"['film', 'event', 'based', 'true', 'crime', 'talk', 'radio', 'show', 'host', 'Denver', 'was', 'killed', 'American', 'Nazi', 'event', 'inspired', 'Talk', 'Radio', 'play', 'film', 'film', 'scenes', 'small', 'town', 'farming', 'region', 'mention', 'economic', 'status', 'are', 'losing', 'dollars', 'population', 'small', 'businesses', 'etc', 'Instead', 'see', 'small', 'group', 'white', 'racists', 'who', 'abduct', 'black', 'man', 'hunt', 'kill', 'too', 'exaggerated', 'believe', 'Federal', 'agents', 'are', 'aware', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'act', 'yet', 'agent', 'sent', 'back', 'get', 'more', 'information', 'are', 'groups', 'sparsely', 'settled', 'areas', 'film', ""n't"", 'explain', 'what', 'created', 'how', 'politicians', 'try', 'use', 'votes', 'contributions', 'real', 'names', 'course.The', 'Federal', 'agent', 'meets', 'report', 'higher', 'ups', 'Then', 'see', 'terrorists', 'prepare', 'hold', 'up', 'bank', 'raise', 'money', 'activities', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'Most', 'bank', 'robberies', 'are', 'done', 'ordinary', 'criminals', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'part', 'group', 'FBI', 'put', 'end', 'organized', 'gangs', 'robbed', 'banks', '1940s', 'Federal', 'agency', ""n't"", 'interfere', 'want', 'more', 'information', 'aims', 'leaders', 'More', 'terrorism', 'planned', 'dynamiting', 'courthouse', 'attacking', 'power', 'station', 'etc', 'terrorist', 'plots', 'here', 'would', 'keep', 'small', 'group', 'busy', '24', 'hours', 'day', 'Kathy', 'secret', 'list', 'friends', 'quickly', 'copied', 'camera', 'Federal', 'agents', 'need', 'know', 'who', 'group', 'will', 'target', 'can', 'arrest', 'Gary', 'meets', 'leader', 'who', 'helicopter', 'documents', 'say', 'Kathy', 'special', 'investigator', 'Kathy', 'being', 'served', 'up', 'sacrifice', 'Gary', 'Kathy', 'travel', 'Chicago', 'where', 'assassination', 'planned', 'will', 'make', 'Gary', 'fall', 'guy', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald', 'second', 'lone', 'gunman', 'politician', 'front', 'building', 'Gary', 'shoot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'try', 'again.Costa-Gavras', 'gained', 'world', 'fame', '1969', 'film', 'Z', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'film', 'rebels', 'South', 'America', 'was', 'popular', 'later', 'films', 'have', 'seemed', 'mediocre', 'better', 'story', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'tried', 'cover', 'so', 'many', 'details', 'plots', 'film', 'better', 'pacing', 'could', 'help', 'threat', 'domestic', 'terrorism', 'still', 'good', 'film', 'e.g.', 'Timothy', 'McVeigh', 'who', 'gave', 'film', 'high', 'rating', 'must', 'love', 'images', 'more', 'facts.A', 'better', 'film', 'today', 'would', 'show', 'bad', 'results', 'NAFTA', 'Free', 'Trade', 'harming', 'most', 'Americans', 'economically', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'never', 'allow', 'film', 'war', 'middle', 'class', 'word', 'nafta', 'Greek', 'Arabic', 'refers', 'petroleum', 'NAFTA', 'symbol', 'policies', 'designed', 'Big', 'Oil', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'calling', 'policy', 'Operation', 'Iraqi', 'Liberation']",N/A
149323,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,079284355X,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[7, 9]","This was one of those mythological films that I speak so highly of in other reviews. This was a gem hidden in the darkness. Looking at the cover, you would never guess that this would be such a powerhouse of a film, but let me be the first to say that it was.Berenger and Winger are amazing in their roles.  Winger giving the best performance that I have ever seen her do, while Berenger takes a character riddled with evil and makes him human.  When I first began this film, I was expecting a very true Hollywood production.  One that would be dark at first, but all of the sudden create this happy world at the end.  This film did nothing close to that.  What was amazing about this film was that it let the audience make it's own decisions.  Not much was handed to you on a silver platter.Upon the first ten minutes of this film, you would probably assume that it was a love story. It is anything BUT a love story.  It is a crime/thriller/drama film, and quite possibly one of the strongest that I have seen in some time.  There are some scenes in this film that I couldn't believe I was watching.  The sheer brilliance of the director left me wondering if this film was really made in 1988.  The cinematography was outstanding.  There is one scene that stands out the most in my mind.  After Berenger tries to ""put down"" his dying horse, he can't pull himself to shoot a living creature, so he has his side-kick do it. After it is done, he runs out into the rain behind Berenger wrapped in a plastic tarp. The image here is of the devil riding close behind.  It is so vivid and so beautifully done that you can't help to wonder what that may represent.  There are a couple of scenes very similar to this as well.Now, this isn't a film without some small flaws.  The young girl was annoying. Perhaps I find young children in these types of films always to be annoying, but in this case it was especially bad.  Also, there were some dopey scenes to this film. There were some parts that I felt I was the director of the film watching some bad lines happen between Berenger and Winger ... but it was only a couple.Betrayed ends like an open-ended question.  It tells you that justice has been served, but not eliminated.  It does not paint a pretty picture of our society. Be prepared if you see this for some embarrassing, yet disturbing images of ethnic hatred in this film.  Some scenes that you will not believe ever happens in our country, but in the back of your mind you know certain evils do exist.  But then also be prepared to see John Mahoney (of Say Anything... fame) do his best work ever.  The war took his son, the bank took his land, why shouldn't he fight in this battle of supremacy?

Chow,"[11, 14]","Let me first say I'm truly shocked that anyone ever made a film this raw in 1988 or any year.The plot: After the murder of a Jewish radio host in Chicago, FBI agent, Katy (Debra Winger) goes undercover with farmers to seduce widower and father of two, Gary (Tom Beringer). Katy forms a close bond with Gary and his family and even moves in with him. Gary is a suspect in the murder and Katy is trying to learn more about Gary's KKK terrorist group and their plan for future attacks.The title suggests this is the classic story of love vs. duty. Katy loves Gary but she is bound by duty to take him down.However this film is so much more. As some have already noted this is based on a true story of ""The Brotherhood"". A Nazi terrorist group that based itself on `The Turner Diaries' and indeed murdered a Jewish radio host and committed a high profile armored car robbery taking a record amount of money (which the FBI never recovered). The film is faithful even to their choice of firearms, Ingram Mac-10s which each member carries.`Betrayed' accurately depicts a family trip to a Klan rally where the children shoot at paper targets of black and Jew cartoons.  This Klan camp is based on Elohim City, a Nazi training camp. (The same one Timothy McVeigh was later to attend.)They also refer to America as ZOG. Zionist Occupational Government.`Betrayed' is smart to make no real political statement. They tell the story, we decide.The production quality of `Betrayed ` is good with fine acting all around. Honorable mention is deserved by underrated actor John Heard who plays Katy's commander and suitor. In 1988 he was still thin.Surprisingly a film this smart was written by Joe Eszterhas.

In this case, Eszterhas should have paid heed to the vast number of war films that are out there.

149331,A1X28NWPDMTDG7,079284355X,Gregg Hillier,"[1, 2]","Director Costa-Gavras loves a good political thriller and ""Betrayed"" starts out beautifully with the murder of a liberal Talk-Radio Host by a group of Neo-Nazis, an event inspired by the real-life murder of Denver DJ Alan Berg. FBI Agent Catherine Weaver (Debra Winger) is sent to Middle America to infiltrate the Neo-Nazis, but soon finds herself falling in love with Gary (Tom Berenger), who may be up to his eyeballs in the conspiracy to eradicate other ""Flaming Liberals."" There is also the sub-plot of a pseudo-relationship between Winger and her FBI Boss Michael (John Heard), who is just as dirty as Berenger's hatemonger. The premise is great but the film is hampered by several flaws: the script by Joe Ezterhaus is too slow and confusing and the action tepid at best. Winger's performance is also problematic: she tries to be weepy and real but is unconvincing as an FBI undercover ace. Watch Jodie Foster in ""Silence of the Lambs"" or even Julianne Moore in ""Hannibal"" and you'll see how badly Winger is out of her element. She and Berenger do have good chemistry, but I suspect part of the problem here is due to Winger and Costra-Gavras having an off-screen relationship during filming.

Less obvious in 'Missing' and more obvious in 'The Music Box' all these three film are nevertheless about the insanity of normality, or, if you like, about how shared responsibility is no responsibility at all. The people doing all these horrible things against other human beings, who happen to be different in their appearance, are all people who share normality with each other, including cosy picnics and whatnot. They have families, apparantly 'love' their children, if 'loving' is the same as sharing normal madness.  The film explains why 'upright US citizens' could do what they did in Song Mi with other people who happened to be different in their appearance. It explains the cosy nazi in Germany during WW2. It explains why all normality and custom which isn't questioned and only obediently performed, in order to be able to pursue a career of some kind, is most immoral and deadly indeed. It explains the madness of 'ways of life' and 'ordinary people', who, like Edison once said, 'seem to invent every excuse possible in order to avoid the pale cast of thought'. Costa-Gavras seems to be one of these rare people, who really meant what they said during the sixties. That he has been able to do these films is really amazing - haven't heared much from him lately though - gotten too old or having lost backers or what? What's 'betrayed' in this film is individual responsibility and rebellion against every kind of authority based on persons and unquestioned, customary 'ways of life'. It's a movie that takes a stand for reasoning and for not obeying anyting but the superior argument for the clearest of axiom, which is: &quot;No man has the right to rule over another man.

149339,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,079284355X,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[2, 2]","This 1988 film starring Debra Winger and Tom Berenger must have seemed outlandish when it was made, but a quarter-century later even director Costa-Gavras' renowned tendency to see right-wingnut conspiracies hidden on every grassy knoll has been outstripped by current-day American political reality.Are there flaws in BETRAYED? Yes. Winger plays Katherine Weaver aka Katie Philips, an FBI agent sent to a Midwestern town to infiltrate a White Supremacist group. Her performance is strictly Jodie Foster As Clarice Starling Lite. Her boss, Mike Carnes (played by John Heard) is also her former lover, and he keeps Katherine/Katie in the field far longer than necessary, partly, it feels, as a punishment for their break-up. It's a mediocritizing element in what otherwise is a deadly serious film.The likeable Berenger plays Gary Simmons, the handsome and charming widowered father of two whom Winger is sent to investigate. Too inevitably, they begin a live-in relationship. At first, Gary seems like a good-hearted hardworking farmer joe interested in bettering his family, but soon Katie begins to hear and see things that are at first merely disturbing (""My Mama bakes the best white cake in the whole White world!""), but soon deteriorate into a living nightmare: Gary takes her ""night hunting"" against a captive black man; Gary ""goes camping"" with family and friends at a Survivalist Retreat populated by Neo-Nazis, Klansmen, Skinheads, and other Race Supremacists; Gary's sweet children begin mouthing comments against ""Dirty rabbis with lice in their beards and Negroes that do it to kids in the butt."" ; the group begins to discuss ""hits"" against well-known left-leaners. Despite the fact that Katie reports these incidents (including the killings) to Mike Carnes, Mike continues to insist that the FBI needs ""more evidence"" to move against Gary and his group, endangering her life more and more.What is most frightening about BETRAYED in 2012 is not the extremism per se, which is still extremism, but the constant undercurrent of less extreme remarks that are today's daily fare on Fox News and other outlets, remarks about ""legal"" versus ""illegal"" Americans, the Bible as ""the only Constitution we'll ever need,"" ""abortion women in pants,"" ""White Christian values,"" and ""taking our country back.""  What Costa-Gavras saw as beyond-the-pale politics in 1988 has become today's Teapublicanism, right down to the candidate secretly funded by wealthy supporters of the Race Supremacist Movement (much as the Koch brothers' father founded the John Birch Society).Does this film ""crap on every symbol of Americanism"" as one reviewer wrote? It depends, I suppose, on what one sees as ""Americanism."" If a viewer believes that America is an exclusivist society only for the few and limited to a narrow interpretation of the values of freedom and democracy, then Gary Simmons is a ballcap wearing hero. If however, a viewer believes that America and America's values are large and great enough to embrace the world, then the fears that Gary expresses seem short-sighted and meaningless.Costa-Gavras very intelligently makes Gary a three-dimensional character: He loves his family, he hates the Nazi symbols his own father fought against in Europe, he mistrusts even the politician who avows his own beliefs, and he sees himself as a man who has been victimized by a corporatist world. At the same time, Gary blames others who have been similarly victimized (but whom he sees as outsiders) for creating that corporatist world. Those in power remain in power by the power of divide- and-conquer, telling Gary what he wants to hear but letting him take the fall for the very failures they create in order to exploit.Whatever your politics in any case, hopefully BETRAYED will make you think of America in terms of a grander vision.",4,Eerily Timely,1346025600,"08 27, 2012",2012,3828,"['1988', 'film', 'starring', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'must', 'have', 'seemed', 'outlandish', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'quarter-century', 'later', 'even', 'director', 'Costa-Gavras', 'renowned', 'tendency', 'see', 'right-wingnut', 'conspiracies', 'hidden', 'grassy', 'knoll', 'been', 'outstripped', 'current-day', 'American', 'political', 'reality.Are', 'flaws', 'BETRAYED', 'Yes', 'Winger', 'Katherine', 'Weaver', 'Katie', 'Philips', 'FBI', 'agent', 'sent', 'Midwestern', 'town', 'infiltrate', 'White', 'Supremacist', 'group', 'performance', 'strictly', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Clarice', 'Starling', 'Lite', 'Her', 'boss', 'Mike', 'Carnes', 'played', 'John', 'Heard', 'also', 'former', 'lover', 'Katherine/Katie', 'field', 'far', 'longer', 'necessary', 'partly', 'punishment', 'break-up', 'mediocritizing', 'element', 'what', 'otherwise', 'deadly', 'serious', 'film.The', 'likeable', 'Berenger', 'Gary', 'Simmons', 'handsome', 'charming', 'widowered', 'father', 'two', 'whom', 'Winger', 'sent', 'investigate', 'Too', 'inevitably', 'begin', 'live-in', 'relationship', 'first', 'Gary', 'good-hearted', 'hardworking', 'farmer', 'joe', 'interested', 'bettering', 'family', 'soon', 'Katie', 'hear', 'see', 'things', 'are', 'first', 'merely', 'disturbing', 'Mama', 'best', 'white', 'cake', 'whole', 'White', 'world', 'soon', 'deteriorate', 'living', 'nightmare', 'Gary', 'night', 'hunting', 'captive', 'black', 'man', 'Gary', 'camping', 'family', 'friends', 'Survivalist', 'Retreat', 'populated', 'Neo-Nazis', 'Klansmen', 'Skinheads', 'other', 'Race', 'Supremacists', 'Gary', 'sweet', 'children', 'begin', 'mouthing', 'comments', 'Dirty', 'rabbis', 'lice', 'beards', 'Negroes', 'do', 'kids', 'butt', 'group', 'discuss', 'hits', 'well-known', 'left-leaners', 'fact', 'Katie', 'incidents', 'including', 'killings', 'Mike', 'Carnes', 'Mike', 'insist', 'FBI', 'more', 'evidence', 'move', 'Gary', 'group', 'endangering', 'life', 'more', 'more.What', 'most', 'frightening', 'about', 'BETRAYED', '2012', 'not', 'extremism', 'se', 'still', 'extremism', 'constant', 'undercurrent', 'less', 'extreme', 'remarks', 'are', 'today', 'daily', 'fare', 'Fox', 'News', 'other', 'outlets', 'remarks', 'legal', 'illegal', 'Americans', 'Bible', 'only', 'Constitution', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'need', 'abortion', 'women', 'pants', 'White', 'Christian', 'values', 'taking', 'country', 'back', 'What', 'Costa-Gavras', 'saw', 'beyond-the-pale', 'politics', '1988', 'become', 'today', 'Teapublicanism', 'right', 'down', 'candidate', 'secretly', 'funded', 'wealthy', 'supporters', 'Race', 'Supremacist', 'Movement', 'much', 'Koch', 'brothers', 'father', 'founded', 'John', 'Birch', 'Society', 'film', 'crap', 'symbol', 'Americanism', 'one', 'reviewer', 'wrote', 'suppose', 'what', 'one', 'Americanism', 'viewer', 'America', 'exclusivist', 'society', 'only', 'few', 'limited', 'narrow', 'interpretation', 'values', 'freedom', 'democracy', 'then', 'Gary', 'Simmons', 'ballcap', 'wearing', 'hero', 'however', 'viewer', 'America', 'America', 'values', 'are', 'large', 'great', 'enough', 'embrace', 'world', 'then', 'fears', 'Gary', 'seem', 'short-sighted', 'meaningless.Costa-Gavras', 'very', 'intelligently', 'Gary', 'three-dimensional', 'character', 'family', 'Nazi', 'own', 'father', 'fought', 'Europe', 'even', 'politician', 'who', 'own', 'beliefs', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'victimized', 'corporatist', 'world', 'same', 'time', 'Gary', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'similarly', 'victimized', 'whom', 'outsiders', 'creating', 'corporatist', 'world', 'power', 'remain', 'power', 'power', 'divide-', 'and-conquer', 'telling', 'Gary', 'what', 'hear', 'letting', 'take', 'fall', 'very', 'create', 'order', 'exploit.Whatever', 'politics', 'case', 'hopefully', 'BETRAYED', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'America', 'terms', 'grander', 'vision']",N/A

I was pleased to see so many familiar faces in the cast: Betsy Blair, (a 1955 Oscar Nominee for ""Marty""), ""Frasier"" dad John Mahoney, John Heard, and character actor Ted Levine (""Silence of the Lambs"") all are here, and all do a wonderful job. (John Mahoney is especially excellent, in a chilling but affable way.)The plot unfolds slowly at first, with only faint hints of what is to come. (Actually, the less you know about this film going in, the more you will be surprised by it.) The ""wholesome"" farm community which seems so ""normal"" holds so much more--something troubling and sinister. But yet, these people still retain that ""wholesome"" normalness to them, even after we see what is underneath. The ""normalness"" never completely goes away, and in some cases, we still are actually able to sympathize with these characters, as depraved as they are. As a previous reviewer said, the ""insanity of normality"". ""Betrayed"" depicts this well.The whole cast is wonderful--Winger is compelling and convincing, as is the rest of the cast. The characterization (and acting) of Tom Berenger as the ""insane/normal"" Gary should be applauded particularly. All through the film his character is consistent--a man with a ""normal"" ability to love those close to him. Even when see how his motivations and world view are so completely warped, we see a Gary who feels deeply, loves, and wants many the ""normal"" things in life. These qualities do not disappear when the darker side of him is revealed, which makes his character all the more fascinating and even sympathetic at times. The ""insanity of normality"" is most evident in his character.Great film score by Bill Conti--understated at times, but effective. All-in-all, a fantastic film.
