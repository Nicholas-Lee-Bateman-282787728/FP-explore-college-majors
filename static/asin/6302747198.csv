De Koning,"[3, 5]","When Warner Archive series announced the title ""Rhapsody"" with Elizabeth Taylor, I was looking all the time on the Amazon site when it should be offered, so that I could order it immediately, as I have no interest in the import version already available for some time. However in the short time it was announced it never was offered by Amazon nor by other sellers and it very quickly disappeared from the Warner Archive series site also. As living in Europe I could never order it from Warner itself because they don't sell the Archive series outside the USA. As Warner must realise that there is considerable interest in this movie, I can only hope that it will be offered in a normal DVD-package, with english subtitles and perhaps a trailer, and  hopefully with some other Elizabeth Taylor titles from the MGM period.",5,Rhapsody from Warner Archive series,1249948800,"08 11, 2009",2009,820,"['When', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'series', 'announced', 'title', 'Rhapsody', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'was', 'looking', 'time', 'Amazon', 'site', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'offered', 'could', 'order', 'immediately', 'have', 'interest', 'import', 'version', 'already', 'available', 'time', 'However', 'short', 'time', 'was', 'announced', 'never', 'was', 'offered', 'Amazon', 'other', 'sellers', 'very', 'quickly', 'disappeared', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'series', 'site', 'also', 'living', 'Europe', 'could', 'never', 'order', 'Warner', 'do', ""n't"", 'sell', 'Archive', 'series', 'USA', 'Warner', 'must', 'realise', 'considerable', 'interest', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'offered', 'normal', 'DVD-package', 'english', 'subtitles', 'perhaps', 'trailer', 'hopefully', 'other', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'titles', 'MGM', 'period']",Rhapsody VHS

331058,A79WW6K24SOYW,6302747198,Amazon Customer,"[6, 8]","I've seen this movie many times. Its definitely a 'period' piece, Liz at her most shallow and vacuous. Obviously, her sole purpose in this movie is to pose, and lounge languidly against some really awful furniture. With that in mind, I'd have to say that some of my fellow reviewers here have been overly-harsh on the movie, and some way too gracious. It is not a great film. For one thing, the scenery, for the most part, is fake. Some of the driving scenes, and the conversations, particularly the ones held 'outside', are hilarious, since they are so obviously held against fake backgrounds. If there are real scenes shot outside, and dare I say it, 'on location' - they are very few in number. Looks like stock footage and backlot shots, to me. The music, on the other hand, is amazing. Now I'm speaking as a (former) violinist, and orchestra member. Even though I know they somehow faked the playing of the soloists (both piano, and violin), I'm still amazed at how real it looks sometimes, especially during the extended concerto passages. And, I still haven't figured out how they did it, back in those days! I don't pay too much attention to the story - it could have been lifted straight out of an early episode of Peyton Place, so its not even worth the effort to point out its flaws, or the sometimes laughable, 'Carol-Burnett/Harvey Korman-style' dialog. And, if there is any real 'scenery' to rave about, it'd almost HAVE to be a young, violet-eyed Liz, who is stunning, even when she's play shallow and vapid.",2,Rhapsody in Blue?,1075507200,"01 31, 2004",2004,1523,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'many', 'times', 'definitely', ""'period"", 'piece', 'Liz', 'most', 'shallow', 'vacuous', 'Obviously', 'sole', 'purpose', 'movie', 'pose', 'lounge', 'languidly', 'really', 'awful', 'furniture', 'mind', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'fellow', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'been', 'overly-harsh', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'gracious', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'scenery', 'most', 'part', 'fake', 'driving', 'scenes', 'conversations', 'particularly', 'ones', 'held', ""'outside"", 'are', 'hilarious', 'are', 'so', 'obviously', 'held', 'fake', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'real', 'scenes', 'shot', 'outside', 'dare', 'say', 'location', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'number', 'stock', 'footage', 'backlot', 'shots', 'music', 'other', 'hand', 'amazing', 'Now', ""'m"", 'speaking', 'former', 'violinist', 'orchestra', 'member', 'Even', 'know', 'somehow', 'faked', 'playing', 'soloists', 'piano', 'violin', ""'m"", 'still', 'amazed', 'how', 'real', 'sometimes', 'especially', 'extended', 'concerto', 'passages', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'figured', 'out', 'how', 'did', 'back', 'days', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lifted', 'straight', 'early', 'episode', 'Peyton', 'Place', 'so', 'not', 'even', 'effort', 'point', 'out', 'flaws', 'sometimes', 'laughable', ""'Carol-Burnett/Harvey"", 'Korman-style', 'dialog', 'real', ""'scenery"", 'rave', 'about', ""'d"", 'almost', 'HAVE', 'be', 'young', 'violet-eyed', 'Liz', 'who', 'stunning', 'even', 'when', 'play', 'shallow', 'vapid']",Rhapsody VHS

The story is well done and the music behind it is great. It also gives one an idea how and what concert violinists and pianists have to undergo in their rigorous preparations before performing on the concert stage and how it would affect their personal lives. The story revolves around the choice of another musician (Elizabeth Taylor) between the violinist and the pianist and in finally commiting herself to one of them.

331062,A3HD7SVBY4JZOW,6302747198,Donegal Dan,"[27, 27]","This movie has always been one of my favorites because it brings me back to my college years (long time ago).  It stars Elizabeth Taylor, Vittorio Gassman and John Ericson , all at their most stunning physically if not artistically.  However, there is not too much to be done with the schmaltzy story about the rich and beautiful young woman who pursues her dashing violinist across Europe only to learn that his violin is more important to him than her company or her money. Meanwhile, her neighbor (Ericson), also a gifted musician (pianist), is yearning for her and happily puts her ahead of his music. Taylor's wealthy father is played effortlessly by Louis Calhern as a sardonic but ultimately caring force in her life (a typical Calhern role). I recommend this film as wonderful escapism and suggest you forget about serious content, lasting significance, etc. and just sit back and enjoy a glamorous if vapid Liz Taylor, a handsome pair of suitors (especially Gassman) and some of the most beautiful music in the world (there are soaring performances, or partial performances,  and background music featuring Tchaikovsky's violin concerto, Rachmaninov's piano concerto and assorted other classical masterpieces).  I was delighted when this came out on DVD but it seems to be in short supply.

I love classical music and  this film did more to bring back that wonderful music which I heard it did and I am happy for that. The acting was sort of corny in some parts but the wonderful music and the cute little Professor Schumann made up for the rest. Elizabeth was good in this role of Lulu, Louise Durant a rich, spoiled socialite who always got what she wanted until she ran into Bronte who wanted fame and money more than her. I liked her father too. He was great in this wonderful role although somewhat detached at first he did come around in the end to encourage her to stick with James, her husband, and to help him become a great pianist. I think he does play as I found two cds of his piano music on Amazon. Don't know if it is the same man though as Claudio Arrau played all the piano music for this film. I mean he actually recorded these pieces just for this movie. He is one terrific pianist. Check him out on You Tube.The ending was terrific for the sanctity of marriage. I was surprised that the  screenwriter had her staying with her husband and not running off with Bronte which would have been more like the newer Hollywood films. This was refreshing and should be in more of today's films. But alas our culture is corrupt and at its end. SAD! However this is a good movie that was not given it's full due. I give it a five.
