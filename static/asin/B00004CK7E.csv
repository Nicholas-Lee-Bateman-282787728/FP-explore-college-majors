I taped it when it was on TV, but I taped it on a Beta machine (remember those?) and no longer can view it.  I've had Amazon searching for it, but to no avail.  It's hard to believe that this great movie would not be available in this day and age of hi-tech devises.  This movie provides a lot of action, drama, on-the-edge-of-your-seat thrill--and without all the swearing you hear so much of today!  A re-make would not do this movie any justice at all.  Keep the original, put it on a DVD and list it, please.  At least tell us why it isn't available?",5,Why Isn't This Available?,1295740800,"01 23, 2011",2011,640,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'year', 'movie', 'long-time', 'all-time', 'TV', 'favorite', 'taped', 'when', 'was', 'TV', 'taped', 'Beta', 'machine', 'remember', 'longer', 'can', 'view', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Amazon', 'searching', 'avail', 'hard', 'believe', 'great', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'available', 'day', 'age', 'hi-tech', 'devises', 'movie', 'lot', 'action', 'drama', 'on-the-edge-of-your-seat', 'thrill', 'swearing', 'hear', 'so', 'much', 'today', 're-make', 'would', 'not', 'do', 'movie', 'justice', 'Keep', 'original', 'put', 'DVD', 'list', 'please', 'least', 'tell', 'why', ""n't"", 'available']",N/A
547022,A1KD93LN4BHUT3,B00004CK7E,Dumb Ox,"[18, 19]","Lush Canadian scenery spreads as far as the eye can see, and yet this obscure little film manages to convey claustrophobia on the part of a timid mute woman compelled to wed a brutish fur trapper named Jean La Bete, whose last name literally translates into ""the Beast"".  This movie boasts a good script, gorgeous cinematography, fine direction and wonderful acting from its leads, Rita Tushingham as Eve and Oliver Reed as Jean.Traumatized by an incident involving Indians, possibly rape judging from her terrified reaction to Jean's advances, Eve lives far away from civilization with her new husband, who is a stranger to her.  They are strangers to one another.  Jean has a fixed idea of what women are good for(having babies), but is forced to reassess his view of Eve when she adamantly refuses to let him touch her.  In the wilderness, this silent young woman works a minor miracle:  She brings civilization to the forest and tames the beastlike man to whom she is married.  As they face dangers and work together, their relationship alters from bully and victim to equals.  Eve grows to care for this rough man as Jean struggles to bring forth his underdeveloped tender side.  He in turn learns to respect her and treat her as a human being instead of property.  Their eventual consummation is tender and yet seems to traumatize her all over again.  She flees, believing him to somehow be her enemy, and he cries out in anguish, unable to follow her, that he was not the one who hurt her in the past.  Both are heartbroken at their parting.  In the end, when the same well-meaning relatives who sold her to Jean try to find her another husband, Eve makes up her mind as to where she belongs.  She has grown from her relationship with the trapper to a confident woman who's willing to face hardships to be truly happy.The cast did a terrific job with the material.  Oliver Reed was masculine as the virile Jean, who curbs his ardor and tries to woo his bride instead of forcing her to accept him.  Rita Tushingham conveys an incredible range of emotions without uttering a word.  The two actors played off each other very well and had a strong onscreen chemistry.  We enjoyed this movie very much, and recommend it to fans of Oliver Reed, Miss Tushingham, or tender yet powerful love stories.",5,"Compelling, Tender Love Story",1110326400,"03 9, 2005",2005,2299,"['Lush', 'Canadian', 'scenery', 'spreads', 'as', 'far', 'eye', 'can', 'see', 'yet', 'obscure', 'little', 'film', 'manages', 'convey', 'claustrophobia', 'part', 'timid', 'mute', 'woman', 'compelled', 'wed', 'brutish', 'fur', 'trapper', 'named', 'Jean', 'La', 'Bete', 'last', 'name', 'literally', 'Beast', 'movie', 'good', 'script', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'fine', 'direction', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'leads', 'Rita', 'Tushingham', 'Eve', 'Oliver', 'Reed', 'Jean.Traumatized', 'incident', 'involving', 'Indians', 'possibly', 'rape', 'judging', 'terrified', 'reaction', 'Jean', 'advances', 'Eve', 'far', 'away', 'civilization', 'new', 'husband', 'who', 'stranger', 'are', 'strangers', 'one', 'Jean', 'fixed', 'idea', 'what', 'women', 'are', 'good', 'having', 'babies', 'forced', 'reassess', 'view', 'Eve', 'when', 'adamantly', 'let', 'touch', 'wilderness', 'silent', 'young', 'woman', 'minor', 'miracle', 'civilization', 'forest', 'beastlike', 'man', 'whom', 'married', 'face', 'dangers', 'work', 'together', 'relationship', 'alters', 'bully', 'victim', 'equals', 'Eve', 'care', 'rough', 'man', 'Jean', 'struggles', 'bring', 'forth', 'underdeveloped', 'tender', 'side', 'turn', 'learns', 'respect', 'treat', 'human', 'being', 'instead', 'property', 'eventual', 'consummation', 'tender', 'yet', 'traumatize', 'over', 'again', 'believing', 'somehow', 'be', 'enemy', 'out', 'anguish', 'unable', 'follow', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'past', 'are', 'heartbroken', 'parting', 'end', 'when', 'same', 'well-meaning', 'relatives', 'who', 'sold', 'Jean', 'try', 'find', 'husband', 'Eve', 'up', 'mind', 'where', 'grown', 'relationship', 'trapper', 'confident', 'woman', 'who', 'willing', 'face', 'hardships', 'be', 'truly', 'happy.The', 'cast', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'material', 'Oliver', 'Reed', 'was', 'masculine', 'virile', 'Jean', 'who', 'curbs', 'ardor', 'tries', 'woo', 'bride', 'instead', 'forcing', 'accept', 'Rita', 'Tushingham', 'conveys', 'incredible', 'range', 'emotions', 'uttering', 'word', 'two', 'actors', 'played', 'off', 'other', 'very', 'well', 'had', 'strong', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'recommend', 'fans', 'Oliver', 'Reed', 'Miss', 'Tushingham', 'tender', 'yet', 'powerful', 'love', 'stories']",N/A

547028,A3JJEUW3LZIVYG,B00004CK7E,Robert Dahl,"[11, 12]","THE TRAP is a wonderful movie, too bad this DVD does not do it justice.The movie is presented in widescreen format. We can see the entire frame in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio. It is not presented in 16:9 anamorphic format though, only 4:3 letterboxed. The movie has a single audio track, in German. There is NO English audio track.The quality of the image is only fair. Schr&ouml;der Media apparently did not remaster the movie from a good print. The image lacks detail, lacks sharpness, and scenes are alternately too bright or too dark (they didn't adjust the film's dynamic range for home video).For the benefit of English-speaking customers, there is a 4:3 cropped pan & scan USA-TV version of the movie included as an extra featurette. The quality is only fair, the color is faded, the image lacks sharpness, and it suffers from the same dynamic range problems as the main feature.All in all, this DVD is a disappointment. The USA-TV version is useless and should not have been included. Rather, the main feature should have been given two selectable audio tracks, German and English, instead of only a German track. It boggles the mind that Schr&ouml;der Media handled it this way, as it is child's play to add a second audio track to a DVD feature.The only positive thing that I can say about this DVD is that the main feature shows the entire 2.35:1 aspect-ratio frame of the original film. I can finally see everything that appeared on the original cinema screen as it was when the film was first released in 1966.And that's the real disappointment here. There are some wonderful scenic vistas of British Columbia in this film that beg to be seen on a properly remastered and restored 16:9 anamorphic widescreen DVD.
