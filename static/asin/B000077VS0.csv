Walter ""awalter""","[13, 13]","When Vincent--a tall, quiet, morose middle-aged man--is fired from his job, he finds himself unexpectedly cut loose from society and set adrift from life as he knows it.  Instead of looking for a job, he casually cons some family and friends out of substantial chunks of money in order to support his wife and three children while he spends week after week driving through the European countryside in winter.  A subdued but inescapable tension builds for the audience as we continually fail to understand what motivates Vincent to risk so much, and this tension becomes only more profound when we realize that Vincent himself does not understand his actions.  ""Time Out"" is a hypnotically sad story told at a measured, melancholy pace with a haunting musical score that circumscribes Vincent's strange, incomprehensible mystery.",5,highly recommended mood movie,1093305600,"08 24, 2004",2004,828,"['When', 'Vincent', 'tall', 'quiet', 'morose', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'fired', 'job', 'unexpectedly', 'cut', 'loose', 'society', 'set', 'adrift', 'life', 'Instead', 'looking', 'job', 'casually', 'family', 'substantial', 'chunks', 'money', 'order', 'support', 'wife', 'three', 'children', 'week', 'week', 'driving', 'European', 'countryside', 'winter', 'subdued', 'inescapable', 'tension', 'builds', 'audience', 'continually', 'fail', 'understand', 'what', 'Vincent', 'risk', 'so', 'much', 'tension', 'only', 'more', 'profound', 'when', 'realize', 'Vincent', 'not', 'understand', 'actions', 'Out', 'hypnotically', 'sad', 'story', 'told', 'measured', 'melancholy', 'pace', 'haunting', 'musical', 'score', 'Vincent', 'strange', 'incomprehensible', 'mystery']",Time Out

Suddenly unemployed, he tries to keep the secret from his wife.  Think of this small lie as a snowball tumbling down the top of a hill - in no time Vincent has a series of stories spun from whole cloth he has to keep in the air, like plates he has to keep spinning at the end of poles...working for the UN, some half-baked investment scheme, a new car on borrowed money.  The whole thing is very unsettling because it's completely plausible to see how Vincent has step by step fallen into this abyss.The ending here isn't the strongest resolution in the world...sort of a cop-out really.  And, for this reason, I don't think 'Time Out' is the great undiscovered French movie that you'll rave to friends about.  *That* movie is Jacques Audiard's ""Read My Lips"" with Vincent Cassel and Emmanuelle Devos.

He also has a wonderful job in Switzerland in one of UN's sections, or has he? At least that's what he tells everybody accepting his wife. In reality he's got fired from his last job several months ago and was afraid to tell. Now he's lying more and more constructing rather shaky and fragile plot of his occupation.This brilliant film everybody is talking to be long and boring isn't that at all. For two hours I couldn't get my eyes off of the screen just like I was watching some thriller. Well, it is a thriller except there are no guns, chases and murders here. It's a thriller from our everydays life and therefore may be close to many. It is unbearable to see the agony of this man, who's a good husband and father, who's kind and sensitive person, but we know that those lies are like cancer - when you know the diagnosis it's already not a matter of whether you'll stay alive or not, but of how much time is left. We know and Vincent knows that soon everything will surface but he can't do anything about it. And therefore even more tragic is the outcome when we see everyone is ready to help and forgive, because it emphasizes one more time a man's loneliness in our world. We don't know the people we live among, we are afraid and don't know what to expect, we are not sure if we're loved... And one of this movie's messages - if you are in trouble - just reach out your hand, there are people who are ready to give you theirs.""Time Out"" is a brilliant, intense drama with excellent directing and outstanding acting.

Although she hated, I absolutely loved it! The story revolves around a man, Vincent, who loses his job and doesn't have the courage to tell his family. To cover for his failure, he concocts an outrageous story about a new job he has gotten for the United Nations, and as the film progresses, we watch as his life goes into a downward spiral. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of this film is the fact that it is truly realistic, both in dealing with the idea of failure and the idea of hopelessness. It's painful to watch, as Vincent wastes away his days doing nothing, while calling his wife to tell her that work is going great, yet at the same time, we can identify with his situation. Pride is one of the greatest human flaws, and the film expertly examines it. Overall, a great film, one that I strongly recommend.

724959,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B000077VS0,Dennis Littrell,"[1, 2]","When I scanned the blurb on the cover of this DVD I thought that this film was a dramatization of the story of Frenchman Jean-Claude Romand from the book The Adversary: A True Story of Monstrous Deception (2000) written by novelist and screen writer Emmanuel Carr&egrave;re.  However, Carr&egrave;re did not write the screen play for L'Emploi du temps, nor is the story in the film the same or even close to ""A True Story of Monstrous Deception.""True, Vincent, the central character, does practice a deception, but it is hardly monstrous.  In fact it is so ordinary and banal that many viewers may find it boring.The film opens with a man pretending to be working while in fact he is just driving around in his car, talking on his cellphone and telling his wife lies about where he is and what he is doing.What is going on?I won't say anymore because part of the effectiveness of this very subtle film stems from not knowing why Vincent is driving around pretending to be working.  If you haven't seen the film I recommend that you not read any reviews on it until you have, because it is difficult to write a review of this film without revealing something that will spoil it for the viewer.  If I had known what Vincent's predicament was prior to viewing, I don't think the film would have held my interest as well as it did.So let me compliment the director, Laurent Cantet, on his fine direction, make note of the interesting and professional camera work, and the fine acting by Aur&eacute;lien Recoing who plays the lead with excellent support from Karin Viard as his wife, Muriel, and Serge Livrozet who plays a mysterious petty criminal.  And let me add that the theme of the film involves the fear of failure and the dehumanization of life within the modern corporate structure, and that it is replete with the sort of vacuous dialogue heard in corporate biz-speak in which vague but seemingly impressive generalities are bandied about in lieu of saying anything specific for fear of giving away too much information.In a sense this is a dismaying satire of the business world, to be compared (distantly) to such films as In the Company of Men (1997)--a sociopathic study within the corporate structure--and  David Mamet's striking Glengarry Glen Ross (1992).I had mixed feelings about the resolution of the film (which of course I will keep vague).  It seemed that the movie could have ended the scene before, the haunting scene in which we hear the voice of Vincent's wife on the cellphone telling him she loves him while we see him walking away from the headlights of his Renault van over the snow toward the blackness of the night.  If the film had ended with that scene how different would our experience have been!  I wonder if originally that was indeed the ending, with the other ending an afterthought.  How different our understanding of Vincent the man would be depending on which ending we experience.Of course if you haven't seen the film, this is way too vague, but I mention the endings because when you do watch the film you might think about how the ending effects the story and our understanding of the film.  Most of the time for me the ending doesn't matter that much.  It's the treatment and the development of the story and the theme, the artistry of the players and the camera work and the direction that count.  Endings sometimes are even arbitrary.  In this film however the ending is important.See this for Aur&eacute;lien Recoing who elicits our empathy over the course of a long and demanding role.",4,"Long, slow, and yet compelling",1135123200,"12 21, 2005",2005,3534,"['When', 'scanned', 'blurb', 'cover', 'DVD', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'dramatization', 'story', 'Frenchman', 'Jean-Claude', 'Romand', 'book', 'Adversary', 'True', 'Story', 'Monstrous', 'Deception', '2000', 'written', 'novelist', 'screen', 'writer', 'Emmanuel', 'Carr', 'egrave', 're', 'However', 'Carr', 'egrave', 're', 'did', 'not', 'write', 'screen', 'play', ""L'Emploi"", 'du', 'temps', 'story', 'film', 'same', 'even', 'close', 'A', 'True', 'Story', 'Monstrous', 'Deception', 'True', 'Vincent', 'central', 'character', 'practice', 'deception', 'hardly', 'monstrous', 'fact', 'so', 'ordinary', 'banal', 'many', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'boring.The', 'film', 'man', 'pretending', 'be', 'working', 'fact', 'just', 'driving', 'around', 'car', 'talking', 'cellphone', 'telling', 'wife', 'where', 'what', 'doing.What', 'going', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anymore', 'part', 'effectiveness', 'very', 'subtle', 'film', 'not', 'knowing', 'why', 'Vincent', 'driving', 'around', 'pretending', 'be', 'working', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'recommend', 'not', 'read', 'reviews', 'have', 'difficult', 'write', 'review', 'film', 'revealing', 'something', 'will', 'spoil', 'viewer', 'had', 'known', 'what', 'Vincent', 'predicament', 'was', 'prior', 'viewing', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'held', 'interest', 'as', 'well', 'let', 'compliment', 'director', 'Laurent', 'Cantet', 'fine', 'direction', 'make', 'note', 'interesting', 'professional', 'camera', 'work', 'fine', 'acting', 'Aur', 'eacute', 'Recoing', 'who', 'lead', 'excellent', 'support', 'Karin', 'Viard', 'wife', 'Muriel', 'Serge', 'Livrozet', 'who', 'mysterious', 'petty', 'criminal', 'let', 'add', 'theme', 'film', 'fear', 'failure', 'dehumanization', 'life', 'modern', 'corporate', 'structure', 'replete', 'sort', 'vacuous', 'dialogue', 'heard', 'corporate', 'biz-speak', 'vague', 'seemingly', 'impressive', 'generalities', 'are', 'bandied', 'lieu', 'saying', 'anything', 'specific', 'fear', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'sense', 'dismaying', 'satire', 'business', 'world', 'be', 'compared', 'distantly', 'such', 'films', 'Company', 'Men', '1997', 'sociopathic', 'study', 'corporate', 'structure', 'David', 'Mamet', 'striking', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', '1992', '.I', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'resolution', 'film', 'course', 'will', 'keep', 'vague', 'seemed', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'scene', 'haunting', 'scene', 'hear', 'voice', 'Vincent', 'wife', 'cellphone', 'telling', 'see', 'walking', 'away', 'headlights', 'Renault', 'van', 'snow', 'blackness', 'night', 'film', 'had', 'ended', 'scene', 'how', 'different', 'would', 'experience', 'have', 'been', 'wonder', 'originally', 'was', 'indeed', 'ending', 'other', 'ending', 'afterthought', 'How', 'different', 'understanding', 'Vincent', 'man', 'would', 'be', 'depending', 'ending', 'experience.Of', 'course', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'way', 'too', 'vague', 'mention', 'endings', 'when', 'do', 'watch', 'film', 'might', 'think', 'how', 'ending', 'effects', 'story', 'understanding', 'film', 'Most', 'time', 'ending', ""n't"", 'matter', 'much', 'treatment', 'development', 'story', 'theme', 'artistry', 'players', 'camera', 'work', 'direction', 'count', 'Endings', 'sometimes', 'are', 'even', 'arbitrary', 'film', 'however', 'ending', 'important.See', 'Aur', 'eacute', 'Recoing', 'who', 'empathy', 'course', 'long', 'demanding', 'role']",Time Out
724960,AQ0YEZRAW0RFN,B000077VS0,Galo Romero,"[1, 1]","Spoiler Alert (This review contains spoilers): There is a subtle and dreamlike quality to this movie: a haunting and sad tale of a man truly disenchanted with life and the system. Vincent (played with a quiet strength by Aur&eacute;lien Recoing), on the surface, lives an idyllic life we all aspire to achieve. He has a loving wife and three children, owns a comfortable home in a good community, and has plenty of friends and family near reach. But, underneath it all, he's living a lie. Unable to tell his wife and family the cold hard truth of his recent unemployment, he fabricates a bountiful and busy life, calling his wife from the road between meetings and informing her of his many business affairs. However, as you can imagine, without gainful employment, money is running low. This is where the lies take on a more sinister tone. In desperation, Vincent chalks up a loan from his father for a fake purchase of a house in Switzerland, where he deceptively states he will need to relocate during the week for a new job he has landed with the United Nations. In order to repay the loan, he begins a Ponzi scheme, victimizing close friends and associates. But the lies and deceit do not fool everyone, and a clever black market business man takes pity on Vincent and offers him temporary employment. But Vincent can't restrain the lies, which are spiraling out of control, causing rifts between him and his family as they grow suspicious of his odd behavior. Predictably and inevitably the truth makes its way to the surface, and Vincent is confronted by his family, and, miraculously, is given a second chance. Forced by his father (a man of influence), to interview for a normal job, the very idea of returning to a normal life proves to be an impossibility, for as the camera closes in on Vincent, we can glean from his expression that it is only a matter of time before he will make a mad dash for his auto and drive off again... running away from the intolerable banality of his existence. And, in those final stirring and chilling moments, we are left with the hapless dread that this man will never be happy... and to wonder how many of us are also like Vincent?",4,"In limbo, the banality of life is unbearable and fascinating.",1337472000,"05 20, 2012",2012,2176,"['Spoiler', 'Alert', 'review', 'spoilers', 'subtle', 'dreamlike', 'quality', 'movie', 'haunting', 'sad', 'tale', 'man', 'truly', 'disenchanted', 'life', 'system', 'Vincent', 'played', 'quiet', 'strength', 'Aur', 'eacute', 'Recoing', 'surface', 'idyllic', 'life', 'aspire', 'achieve', 'loving', 'wife', 'three', 'children', 'comfortable', 'home', 'good', 'community', 'plenty', 'friends', 'family', 'reach', 'living', 'lie', 'Unable', 'tell', 'wife', 'family', 'cold', 'hard', 'truth', 'recent', 'unemployment', 'bountiful', 'busy', 'life', 'calling', 'wife', 'road', 'meetings', 'informing', 'many', 'business', 'affairs', 'However', 'can', 'imagine', 'gainful', 'employment', 'money', 'running', 'low', 'where', 'lies', 'take', 'more', 'sinister', 'tone', 'desperation', 'Vincent', 'up', 'loan', 'father', 'fake', 'purchase', 'house', 'Switzerland', 'where', 'deceptively', 'will', 'need', 'relocate', 'week', 'new', 'job', 'landed', 'United', 'Nations', 'order', 'repay', 'loan', 'Ponzi', 'scheme', 'victimizing', 'close', 'friends', 'associates', 'lies', 'deceit', 'do', 'not', 'fool', 'everyone', 'clever', 'black', 'market', 'business', 'man', 'pity', 'Vincent', 'temporary', 'employment', 'Vincent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'restrain', 'lies', 'are', 'spiraling', 'control', 'causing', 'rifts', 'family', 'grow', 'suspicious', 'odd', 'behavior', 'Predictably', 'inevitably', 'truth', 'way', 'surface', 'Vincent', 'confronted', 'family', 'miraculously', 'given', 'second', 'chance', 'Forced', 'father', 'man', 'influence', 'interview', 'normal', 'job', 'very', 'idea', 'returning', 'normal', 'life', 'proves', 'be', 'impossibility', 'camera', 'Vincent', 'can', 'glean', 'expression', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'will', 'make', 'mad', 'dash', 'auto', 'drive', 'off', 'again', 'running', 'away', 'intolerable', 'banality', 'existence', 'final', 'stirring', 'chilling', 'moments', 'are', 'left', 'hapless', 'dread', 'man', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'happy', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'are', 'also', 'Vincent']",Time Out

But there is another force working at Vincent, inside him and it is just as powerful, if not more so, in his game-playing.He is in thrall to his father, a wealthy businessman who, thanks to his great success, has been able to not only raise Vincent well but also psychologically tie a noose around his neck his entire life.  Although this does not seem to be a major theme, it becomes crystal clear near the end of the film.  Vincent's own &quot;success&quot; is a mockery of his father's as he scams people left and right, lies to those he knows and loves, and engages in criminal activity.This subtle display of familial dysfunction is a brilliant psychological character study and for that reason alone, makes this a film worth not only watching but owning.  It's possible not too many others will have this interpretation of the film, but from my perspective, that's what it is.Highly recommended.",4,Daddy's boy,1088985600,"07 5, 2004",2004,1112,"['French', 'are', 'masters', 'subtlety', 'here', 'film', 'Vincent', 'quiet', 'family', 'man', 'up', 'appearance', 'having', 'job', 'make', 'family', 'wife', 'three', 'kids', 'feel', 'secure', 'force', 'working', 'Vincent', 'just', 'as', 'powerful', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'game-playing.He', 'thrall', 'father', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'who', 'thanks', 'great', 'success', 'been', 'able', 'not', 'only', 'raise', 'Vincent', 'well', 'also', 'psychologically', 'tie', 'noose', 'neck', 'entire', 'life', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'major', 'theme', 'crystal', 'clear', 'end', 'film', 'Vincent', 'own', 'quot', 'success', 'quot', 'mockery', 'father', 'people', 'left', 'right', 'loves', 'criminal', 'activity.This', 'subtle', 'display', 'familial', 'dysfunction', 'brilliant', 'psychological', 'character', 'study', 'reason', 'alone', 'film', 'worth', 'not', 'only', 'watching', 'owning', 'possible', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'others', 'will', 'have', 'interpretation', 'film', 'perspective', 'what', 'is.Highly', 'recommended']",Time Out

This can in theory be to blame for my claim that ""Time Out"" does not really build the quiet tension as affectively as it tries to be. Perhaps this is because I have encountered more than one career pretender in the workplace and cannot sympathize. I rented ""Time Out"" because of its presence on few critical Top Ten lists and it is well made.Recoing plays a senior-level manager who has been released from his job in finance. He drives around France and Switzerland to keep away from his wife and family, who grow suspicious of him. His schemes include scamming associates, who are desperate to invest their money (as many well-off Europeans do) in ways invisible to the local tax collectors. Despite his good status at his old job, he lacks real knowledge about global finance (basic concepts, really) and has to siphon what he can from inside an office building. His growing alienation from his wife (played by Viard) becomes a central theme of the film; this relationship is excellently conveyed by the two actors.The plausiblity of the plot is 100%, the principal acting is perfect and the pacing is consistent throughout the film. So why is ""Time Out"" not as entertaining as ""Fargo,"" about another white-collar scammer buried under his own lies, or ""Glengarry Glen Ross,"" about toxic competition between salesmen? Maybe some of the subtlety is lost across the Atlantic: there are immense differences between American and European work cultures.  Maybe I missed some things (Ebert wrote that the wife had suspicions about his actual job before the firing, but I didn't pick that up). Maybe unemployment is just not as big of a deal in the social state of France, and anxiety over not having a job seems a little out of place to me. My suspicion is that the subplots involving the children and family members detract, rather than supplement, the main story. Weak members of the cast abound, and its hard to distinguish intentional awkwardness from unintentional awkwardness.Recommended for the patient viewer, but I prefer the Belgian film ""Rosetta,"" a story about desperate unemployment with its own subtle elements.",3,Good film ... maybe a little too subtle,1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,2217,"['should', 'point', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'French', 'watched', 'film', 'subtitles', 'can', 'theory', 'be', 'blame', 'claim', 'Time', 'Out', 'not', 'really', 'build', 'quiet', 'tension', 'as', 'affectively', 'be', 'Perhaps', 'have', 'encountered', 'more', 'one', 'career', 'pretender', 'workplace', 'can', 'not', 'sympathize', 'rented', 'Time', 'Out', 'presence', 'few', 'critical', 'Top', 'Ten', 'well', 'made.Recoing', 'senior-level', 'manager', 'who', 'been', 'released', 'job', 'finance', 'France', 'Switzerland', 'keep', 'away', 'wife', 'family', 'who', 'grow', 'suspicious', 'schemes', 'include', 'scamming', 'associates', 'who', 'are', 'desperate', 'invest', 'money', 'many', 'well-off', 'Europeans', 'do', 'ways', 'invisible', 'local', 'tax', 'collectors', 'good', 'status', 'old', 'job', 'real', 'knowledge', 'global', 'finance', 'basic', 'concepts', 'really', 'siphon', 'what', 'can', 'inside', 'office', 'building', 'growing', 'alienation', 'wife', 'played', 'Viard', 'central', 'theme', 'film', 'relationship', 'excellently', 'conveyed', 'two', 'actors.The', 'plausiblity', 'plot', '100', '%', 'principal', 'acting', 'perfect', 'pacing', 'consistent', 'film', 'So', 'why', 'Time', 'Out', 'not', 'as', 'entertaining', 'Fargo', 'white-collar', 'scammer', 'buried', 'own', 'lies', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'toxic', 'competition', 'salesmen', 'Maybe', 'subtlety', 'lost', 'Atlantic', 'are', 'immense', 'differences', 'American', 'European', 'work', 'cultures', 'Maybe', 'missed', 'things', 'Ebert', 'wrote', 'wife', 'had', 'suspicions', 'actual', 'job', 'firing', 'did', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'Maybe', 'unemployment', 'just', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'social', 'state', 'France', 'anxiety', 'not', 'having', 'job', 'little', 'place', 'suspicion', 'subplots', 'involving', 'children', 'family', 'members', 'detract', 'rather', 'supplement', 'main', 'story', 'Weak', 'members', 'cast', 'abound', 'hard', 'distinguish', 'intentional', 'awkwardness', 'unintentional', 'awkwardness.Recommended', 'patient', 'viewer', 'prefer', 'Belgian', 'film', 'Rosetta', 'story', 'desperate', 'unemployment', 'own', 'subtle', 'elements']",Time Out

I don't know where people get off giving this four or five stars for, this movie reminds one of the work of a film school student who came up with half of a good idea and successfully pitched it but when it came to finishing the story ran out of poop.  The movie starts off promisingly; a man is fired from a career job and to hide this from his family concocts a story about being hired to an important position at the UN, and a scheme to swindle his family, acquaintances and business associates so that he can afford to live the lie presumably until he lands on his feet.  Alas the promise of the story is strangled by the numerous sections of the film filled tedious, over-wrought and downright tawdry sections of nothing but morose music and rather pointless shots of the protagonist driving, or walking or thinking or sitting.  Meanwhile the audience is yawning or fidgeting or groaning or snoozing.  Fast forwarding through these bits of self-indulgent rubbish takes five to ten seconds so you can imagine how long it takes to view them.  Furthermore, the director attempts to create a family dynamic that is both adrift and riven by tension but utterly fails simply because there is no real point to it; it is misery for misery's sake.  Which, by the way is just like the movie on the whole.  The reason being that while the story does start out with some promise, it never develops into anything.  The 'star' creates a ponzi scheme to bilk his friends AND gets caught at it by a mystery man with ties to the underworld and even gets involved with the fellow, THEN has his ponzi scheme called by his friends, THEN gets found out by his family and yet NOTHING HAPPENS.
