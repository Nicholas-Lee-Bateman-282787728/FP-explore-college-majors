A nice little series that is fast paced and helps kids relate because it is hosted by kids.,5,Great for kids and adults,1396483200,"04 3, 2014",2014,226,"['series', '2', '1/2', 'yr', 'old', 'attention', 'will', 'sit', 'watch', 'doing', 'caught', 'father', 'attention', 'too', 'nice', 'little', 'series', 'fast', 'paced', 'kids', 'relate', 'hosted', 'kids']",Popular Mechanics For Kids: The Complete Series
1637450,A1FDVT0DLJWV78,B00BQ1S3N8,D. A. J.,"[4, 4]","I know, I know - people hate hearing this sentiment, but it is true - they just don't make television like they used to! Kids shows is no exception. Popular Mechanics for Kids is a great show for kids in the 6 - 12 age range. The kid hosts do all sorts of fun adventures as they learn the inner workings of a wide range of science topics. The topics are great because they answer questions kids would rally be interested in, as well as show them various careers and happenings many kids may not even know exist. Their expert Charlie also has great projects kids can try at home as well (how cool to try and make your own fire extinguisher - just for fun, kids are warned to never try to use it to actually put out a fire). Overall, would definitely recommend for hours of fun and learning for kids.The series is a bit dated (ran from 1997 - 2001), but most of the science is still solid. Some of the fun is finding things they mentioned were &#34;going&#34; to happen and see if they came to fruition (i.e. the International Space Station and their predictions on electric cars).Also, if the main girl host seems a bit familiar, she went on to play the daughter of Jack Bauer in the television show &#34;24&#34;.",5,Love this series,1388275200,"12 29, 2013",2013,1212,"['know', 'know', 'people', 'hate', 'hearing', 'sentiment', 'true', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'television', 'used', 'Kids', 'exception', 'Popular', 'Mechanics', 'Kids', 'great', 'show', 'kids', '6', '12', 'age', 'range', 'kid', 'hosts', 'do', 'sorts', 'fun', 'adventures', 'learn', 'inner', 'workings', 'wide', 'range', 'science', 'topics', 'topics', 'are', 'great', 'answer', 'questions', 'kids', 'would', 'rally', 'be', 'interested', 'as', 'well', 'show', 'various', 'careers', 'happenings', 'many', 'kids', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'exist', 'expert', 'Charlie', 'also', 'great', 'projects', 'kids', 'can', 'try', 'home', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'cool', 'try', 'make', 'own', 'fire', 'extinguisher', 'just', 'fun', 'kids', 'are', 'warned', 'never', 'try', 'use', 'actually', 'put', 'out', 'fire', 'Overall', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'hours', 'fun', 'learning', 'kids.The', 'series', 'bit', 'dated', 'ran', '1997', '2001', 'most', 'science', 'still', 'solid', 'fun', 'finding', 'things', 'mentioned', 'were', '34', 'going', '34', 'happen', 'see', 'came', 'fruition', 'i.e', 'International', 'Space', 'Station', 'predictions', 'electric', 'cars', '.Also', 'main', 'girl', 'host', 'bit', 'familiar', 'went', 'play', 'daughter', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'television', 'show', '34', '24', '34']",Popular Mechanics For Kids: The Complete Series
