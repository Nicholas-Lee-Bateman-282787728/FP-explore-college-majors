The cast is excellent (this was the performance that launched Sigfried Jerusalem's career); they sung well and looked and acted their parts. Scenery, much of which was filmed on location, is beautiful and costumes are bright and attractive. Although the movie was made in 1975, it has been transfered to digital very well and sounds and looks as good as a current recording",5,Excellent performance of a very good operetta,1248480000,"07 25, 2009",2009,480,"['Gypsy', 'Baron', 'one', 'Strauss', 'best', 'operettas', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'have', 'seen', 'cast', 'excellent', 'was', 'performance', 'launched', 'Sigfried', 'Jerusalem', 'career', 'sung', 'well', 'looked', 'acted', 'parts', 'Scenery', 'much', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'are', 'bright', 'attractive', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1975', 'been', 'transfered', 'digital', 'very', 'well', 'sounds', 'as', 'good', 'current', 'recording']",N/A

These flashbacks stop the dramatic momentum.  In addition they distort the character of Carnero giving him a gravitas that is not deserved.  I also found the color palette very drab -- it is unclear if this was due to the limitations of the filming or a deliberate artistic decision.  I found the audio very out of synch with the video.  The DTS had very little sound spread but I suspect this was the best that could be obtained from the soundtrack of this 1975 movie.  There were a few highlights that I found interesting.  The major one was the opening journey from Vienna to the Barinkay estate.  The multiple modes of transportation and the countryside shots were amazing.  However this does not rescue the production.  I found the Morbisch production much more satisfying and true, in my opinion, to the original intent of the composer.",2,Director additions compromise the entire production,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,986,"['Director', 'added', 'periodic', 'flashbacks', 'centering', 'report', 'being', 'written', 'Conte', 'Carnero', 'bumbling', 'important', 'comic', 'character', 'flashbacks', 'stop', 'dramatic', 'momentum', 'addition', 'distort', 'character', 'Carnero', 'giving', 'gravitas', 'not', 'deserved', 'also', 'found', 'color', 'palette', 'very', 'drab', 'unclear', 'was', 'due', 'limitations', 'filming', 'deliberate', 'artistic', 'decision', 'found', 'audio', 'very', 'synch', 'video', 'DTS', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'sound', 'spread', 'suspect', 'was', 'best', 'could', 'be', 'obtained', 'soundtrack', '1975', 'movie', 'were', 'few', 'highlights', 'found', 'interesting', 'major', 'one', 'was', 'opening', 'journey', 'Vienna', 'Barinkay', 'estate', 'multiple', 'modes', 'transportation', 'countryside', 'shots', 'were', 'amazing', 'However', 'not', 'rescue', 'production', 'found', 'Morbisch', 'production', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying', 'true', 'opinion', 'original', 'intent', 'composer']",N/A

Talented cast, fabulous voices, Stuttgart Symphony Orchestra and chorus, all together make a great production.  This operetta feels more Viennese than Hungarian.  Lovely costumes and scenery.

The singing is fine, but the handling is so heavy-handed that it hardly seems worth the bother. The 1950s German film of ""the Gypsy Baron"" was infinitely better.
