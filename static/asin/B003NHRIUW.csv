I'm not a Sparks reader. So I went in with his ending in my head. Miley has grown by huge leaps since her first entry onto the big screen. But it was all the characters who drew me in and yes, Sparks had to have provided the structure for these great characters. I cried and cried. You just have to see the film to understand.

1355343,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B003NHRIUW,Andrew Ellington,"[30, 39]","In watching `The Last Song' over the weekend (to be honest, I actually wanted to do this), I decided that it was probably best to present this review in three sections; the pros, the cons and my verdict.It just makes more sense this way.THE PROS:The beachfront setting of the film, not unlike a previous Sparks film adaptation `Nights in Rodanthe', is stunning and certainly creates a mood, the same mood that follows a lot of Sparks' stories.  You can feel the love in the air from the moment the sandy shores are revealed.  The acting here is also quite decent, with the exception of Kelly Preston who is just really bad at whatever it is she is trying to do.  Greg Kinnear is always a welcome presence, and he layers the stereotypical `dad' role with enough personality to make him endearing.  Liam Hemsworth is like a talented Paul Walker (they look very similar) and that is becoming.  I see a career in front of him that may (and I'm not really joking here) lead him to some award recognition in ten years or so.  That said, the star of the show has a decent three-quarter turn here.  Once here character gets out of the `I'm trying to be distant and rebellious' stage she actually shines.  So, I'd say that a good 75% of Miley Cyrus's performance is pretty darn good.  I'll tell you this, the main performances (and the nonchalant way the film is edited in parts) goes a long way to making this film entertaining, since there are a lot more cons than pros here.  But, before I switch gears, I want to mention the biggest pro here and that is the theme song to the film.  `When I Look At You' is beautifully sung (yes, I'm talking about you Miss Cyrus) and effortlessly captivating.  It actually yanks at your heartstrings more than this movie does!Ok, we must move on.THE CONS:Nicholas Sparks has absolutely NO imagination.  Really, it's like he wrote this one book many, many years ago and decided that it was so successful and so well written that, instead of challenging himself to try anything new, he was just going to `rinse and repeat' for the rest of his life.  Like you may have guessed it, Ronnie meets Will and falls in love.  Will is from a different social standing than Ronnie.  They don't initially get along but they fall in love quick.  There are problems within the family dynamic.  Oh yeah, someone dies.  Typical Sparks' material.  That said, Sparks usually shines in this genre, but this film feels forced for me.  I think the biggest issue is that Sparks doesn't understand modern romance.  He totally gets that dated love that shines in films like `The Notebook', and he even understood the aged romantic dynamic in `Nights in Rodanthe' and even `Message in a Bottle', but the way he crafts modern teenage romance is stilted and phony to the taste.  It just doesn't seem real, and then when he tries to pepper in modern issues (like the abusive boyfriend with the homeless girlfriend) it looks very skeletal in form and unbelievable.  Another issue here is the first 25% of Miley's performance.  It is so forced, and that comic relief she tries to deliver with the whole sea turtle bit (that whole subplot was poorly executed) was atrocious.  I wish I could wipe that whole section from the film.  The films rapid deterioration as the film draws to a close is also a tad underworked.  When a certain character winds up sick, the sickness comes on so ridiculously rapidly that one is stunned as to why NO ONE NOTICED IT BEFORE.  It just doesn't make much sense at all.I also want to say this; Miley Cyrus is not the most attractive girl in the world.  In fact, the way she holds her face can be comically off-putting at times (and it is also what made the first part of her performance so out of place), but her funny looks could play into her favor once she hones her acting skills.  She obviously has some talent (her emotional breakdown upon hearing some tragic news is remarkably in tact and believable) and I can see her developing into a nice actress one day.  The fact that she isn't afraid to look ugly (I know that sounds harsh, but if you are a cinephile like me you'll understand that that isn't really meant as an insult) will help her create more reality within her characters.  We all know that NO ONE is pretty all of the time.  Notice the way that Miley holds her face even towards the films end, when she is looking off or standing in a crowd.  She looks lazy and frumpy and at times like she smells something gross.  In other words, she looks natural.  It works for her in parts, and honestly, if she keeps that up and begins to understand a little better HOW to emote completely I could very well see her getting on the track she claimed she desired (not too long ago she mentioned that she wanted to be like Kate Winslet - great aspirations young lady - and do a dramatic film like `Revolutionary Road').  I don't see her as the next Kate-the-Great (that would be a stretch), but the next Natalie Portman?Give her five years and ask me that again.And still, the film is worth seeing at least once.MY VERDICT:It could have been a lot better.  Even `A Walk to Remember', which is saddled with some clich&eacute;s that surround everything Sparks' writes, manages to be a lot more realistically sound than this film, and a lot more endearing (this movie didn't even bring me close to tears, and it really needed to).  Still, it is a decent summer romance movie and it certainly has everything the tweens are looking for.  My brother loves this movie (for reasons I am sure we don't share) and I'm sure you're twelve year old will too.  If the day is rainy and the mood is light, I'd have no problem watching this film again, as long as it's on cable TV and I'm not paying for it.",3,"The good, the bad, the honest

1355345,A2YH3YTPSCAWF9,B003NHRIUW,"Anthony Marinelli ""marilread""","[0, 1]","As i was watching this film,and i will give you a bit of a prologue,to judge what follows,i thought of a very youngbrooke shields and was she involved with calvin klein,and i recall two of the film she made the blue lagoon(why blue?)which was released with much fanfare and promotion and JUst you and me kid with george burns who also did the sunshine boys and oh god (with bob denver a favorite singer of my youth)...the critics didnt particularly like her film roles,i thought the Burns film was cute but i list all these things and her domineering/controlling mother,the imagery created and put into our minds to interest us in her,but she seemed away from the imagery to be a nice person,its just what was trying to be created which was wrong,and her film career didnt last and she made a tv show and i see her now and then. Much more prominent i recall Burns sidekick gracie allen,one of my favorite people from early tv land who was funny and deflating of much that needed and was wrong in a wistful air...i laugh when i think of her with nostalgia. Anyways i saw this film,and i was not knowing what to get from the famous tv show she created and the neon intensity and much else is toned down and her acting is apropos and the film is actually good for someone whoose acting is not their bread and butter...she's famous in other media. We begin the film with her fighting with a younger brother(of course in contemporary life she's trying to rear him)and having gone through someproblem with the law and whoose mother leaves her with brother and father and her mom's mind is on marrying. A contemporary situation revisited in many homes. She is then made a pass at at a carnival scene near the water(this imagery is attractive,as well as the area where it was filmed)and is derisive toward her attacker, who attempts to unsuccessfully make a pass at night in another location. Then while all this is ongoing,we have a raccoon in the environment,as near all waters,they are not so much parasitic,they actually ward off other parasites much worse,but the minds of all are disturbed by these pests. There is a good scene with this male where she likes and admits she has fun and shakes hands with the romantic male,fun and intimacy here are linked in her mind,a reader of dense fiction including the realistic tolstoy(i think he is)and while this is ongoing the young child wants the family back together,a child's imposition on the adult world,but the adults have their own way,and the father seems nice and dreamy as he's called,but seems to be existing rather than liking anything that's ongoing. Miley's interlocutor is depicted as having many girlfriends,and he is going through the rituals but now he has found love,his emotional centers have been touched.then there is a subplot about a burning church,and a wedding scene,and a theme in the film is how wealthy people cause the city to decline in all kind of ways,and not so much them but those they influence,and there is a scene at a wedding where a poor and uneducated person takes his class hatred out by pummelling this guy and trying to take away this girl...these kinds of tensions are on the rise these days. The film works since it radiates from miley as she is the center of the film,and we learn throughout the film as people interact with her,and it's an interesting film,as from an estranged person she develops some values and goes through a love and sensual series of events but then develops her reason and reflection and adequately deals with a dieing father and a boyfriend. She seems believable,and the film is different than what i expected...actually storylines and subject matter in female characters i like. I hope in future films she's able to develop her talents,in film,an area not her home but where she can develop a comfort zone..notice the names in this film the boy is jonah and one of the girls blake i think...what imagery is there?",4,A Good first movie,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,3927,"['i', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'i', 'will', 'give', 'bit', 'prologue', 'judge', 'what', 'i', 'thought', 'very', 'youngbrooke', 'shields', 'was', 'involved', 'calvin', 'klein', 'i', 'recall', 'two', 'film', 'made', 'blue', 'lagoon', 'why', 'blue', 'was', 'released', 'much', 'fanfare', 'promotion', 'JUst', 'kid', 'george', 'burns', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'sunshine', 'boys', 'oh', 'god', 'bob', 'denver', 'favorite', 'singer', 'youth', 'critics', 'didnt', 'particularly', 'film', 'roles', 'i', 'thought', 'Burns', 'film', 'was', 'cute', 'i', 'list', 'things', 'domineering/controlling', 'mother', 'imagery', 'created', 'put', 'minds', 'interest', 'seemed', 'away', 'imagery', 'be', 'nice', 'person', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'created', 'was', 'wrong', 'film', 'career', 'didnt', 'last', 'made', 'tv', 'show', 'i', 'see', 'now', 'then', 'Much', 'more', 'prominent', 'i', 'recall', 'Burns', 'sidekick', 'gracie', 'allen', 'one', 'favorite', 'people', 'early', 'tv', 'land', 'who', 'was', 'funny', 'deflating', 'much', 'needed', 'was', 'wrong', 'wistful', 'air', 'i', 'when', 'i', 'think', 'nostalgia', 'i', 'saw', 'film', 'i', 'was', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'get', 'famous', 'tv', 'show', 'created', 'neon', 'intensity', 'much', 'else', 'toned', 'down', 'acting', 'apropos', 'film', 'actually', 'good', 'someone', 'whoose', 'acting', 'not', 'bread', 'butter', 'famous', 'other', 'media', 'begin', 'film', 'fighting', 'younger', 'brother', 'course', 'contemporary', 'life', 'trying', 'rear', 'having', 'gone', 'someproblem', 'law', 'whoose', 'mother', 'brother', 'father', 'mom', 'mind', 'marrying', 'contemporary', 'situation', 'revisited', 'many', 'homes', 'then', 'made', 'pass', 'carnival', 'scene', 'water', 'imagery', 'attractive', 'as', 'well', 'area', 'where', 'was', 'filmed', 'derisive', 'attacker', 'who', 'unsuccessfully', 'make', 'pass', 'night', 'location', 'Then', 'ongoing', 'have', 'raccoon', 'environment', 'waters', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'parasitic', 'actually', 'ward', 'other', 'parasites', 'much', 'worse', 'minds', 'are', 'disturbed', 'pests', 'good', 'scene', 'male', 'where', 'fun', 'shakes', 'hands', 'romantic', 'male', 'fun', 'intimacy', 'here', 'are', 'linked', 'mind', 'reader', 'dense', 'fiction', 'including', 'realistic', 'tolstoy', 'i', 'think', 'ongoing', 'young', 'child', 'family', 'back', 'together', 'child', 'imposition', 'adult', 'world', 'adults', 'have', 'own', 'way', 'father', 'nice', 'dreamy', 'called', 'be', 'existing', 'rather', 'liking', 'anything', 'ongoing', 'Miley', 'interlocutor', 'depicted', 'having', 'many', 'girlfriends', 'going', 'rituals', 'now', 'found', 'love', 'emotional', 'centers', 'have', 'been', 'touched.then', 'subplot', 'burning', 'church', 'wedding', 'scene', 'theme', 'film', 'how', 'wealthy', 'people', 'cause', 'city', 'decline', 'kind', 'ways', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'influence', 'scene', 'wedding', 'where', 'poor', 'uneducated', 'person', 'class', 'hatred', 'out', 'pummelling', 'guy', 'trying', 'take', 'away', 'girl', 'kinds', 'tensions', 'are', 'rise', 'days', 'film', 'miley', 'center', 'film', 'learn', 'film', 'people', 'interact', 'interesting', 'film', 'estranged', 'person', 'values', 'love', 'sensual', 'series', 'events', 'then', 'reason', 'reflection', 'adequately', 'deals', 'dieing', 'father', 'boyfriend', 'believable', 'film', 'different', 'what', 'i', 'expected', 'actually', 'storylines', 'subject', 'matter', 'female', 'characters', 'i', 'hope', 'future', 'films', 'able', 'develop', 'talents', 'film', 'area', 'not', 'home', 'where', 'can', 'develop', 'comfort', 'zone..notice', 'names', 'film', 'boy', 'jonah', 'one', 'girls', 'blake', 'i', 'think', 'what', 'imagery', 'there']",N/A

E Jackson,"[1, 2]","Mark my words- the *only* reason people are talking about the Last Song is because the main character is Miley Cyrus.Obviously this film was made with the intention of finding out whether her acting skills can stand in the same league as her successful music career, and the answer is... yes, her acting performance is pretty good for the most part. She's convincing whenever she's upset with her father, and her stubbornness to accept a guy who constantly tries hitting on her is strikingly good too.It's the fact she stars in a movie with bland, predictable, mediocre writing that makes the Last Song lose serious points in a hurry.Folks, this storyline is *horrible*. You will know exactly what's coming, and when it's coming. Miley's character goes to visit her father (along with her younger brother) and right away it's obvious she doesn't get along with her father, so she goes out and makes friends that eventually end up ditching her, and she even develops feelings for a guy after a long-winded and predictably written chunk of the storyline goes by, and well, that's pretty much it. Totally bland writing the entire way through.  You will be able to properly guess each segment of storytelling.I highly recommend avoiding the Last Song. An obvious attempt to make some money because the lead actress is a popular music singer. The worst part is that the film hardly takes advantage of her singing. That's how we know the Last Song was an obvious test to see whether she'd make it in Hollywood.

1355355,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003NHRIUW,Chris Pandolfi,"[10, 15]","If you didn't get your fill of sappy Nicholas Sparks melodrama with the February release of ""Dear John,"" grab a box of Kleenex and head to your local theater, because ""The Last Song"" has finally opened. Sparks must get some psychological fix from making audiences cry. There's nothing wrong with catharsis, but I do take issue with stories that try to manipulate in such obvious ways. This movie, so far as I can tell, has no ambition other than to toy with our emotions, and not in a way that's clever, intelligent, or subtle; it simply goes from one contrived situation to the next before ending on a shamelessly sentimental note. How could it end any other way when it makes use of such an inherently ominous title?When I reviewed ""Dear John,"" I stated, rather inelegantly, that, ""I can't feel a certain way when a movie is telling me that I'm supposed to feel that way."" Here's my chance to say the same thing, only more refined: A movie should not tell me to feel the feelings I'm supposed to feel. If I'm to have a genuine emotional payoff, the story must work with me and not at me; ""The Last Song"" was so aggressive in its attempts to get a reaction that I felt not like an audience member but an unwilling participant in a psychological study. There's nothing to be gained by making us sit through a series of events so manufactured and heavy handed, they seem to have been borrowed from a weepy after school special.I can find nothing wrong with the casting of Greg Kinnear, a decent and accomplished actor who does the best he can given the material. But the casting of Miley Cyrus is problematic. While her performance isn't especially bad, it's hardly remarkable -- any young actress could have played this role and been just as good. Ah, but not every young actress has her face adorned on album covers, shampoo bottles, T-shirts, posters, and magnets. She's marketable. If it's advertised that she will star in a movie, people will come to see it. I do have hope that she will someday shed her teen idol image and emerge as a serious performer, but until then, she will have to make do with her status as a packaged product.Cyrus plays Ronnie Miller, a seventeen-year-old piano prodigy. She hasn't spoken to her father, former music professor Steve Miller (Kinnear), ever since he divorced her mother (Kelly Preston) and returned to the small, quiet beach community of Tybee Island, Georgia, his hometown. Moody and rebellious, Ronnie has stopped playing the piano, and she flatly refuses offers to attend Julliard. Against her wishes, she and her kid brother, Jonah (Bobby Coleman), are sent to spend the summer with Steve, which he hopes will finally give them a chance to reconnect. Ronnie's attitude is a pall that hangs over the whole thing, as is Steve's mission to rebuild a stained glass window from a church that burned under mysterious circumstances.But what would this movie be without a romance? Here enters Will Blakelee (Liam Hemsworth), the hunky Volleyball player who's also a mechanic and a volunteer for the local aquarium. Popular, charming, and annoyingly persistent, he soon gets Ronnie to drop her misery act, at which point they fall in deeply in love. He eventually takes her to meet his wealthy parents, who, naturally, snub their noses at her in the most polite way possible. Will has his own tragic back story, although you'd hardly believe it -- there are precious few moments in this movie when Hemsworth isn't showing off a big dopey grin, drastically undermining his character's personal problems.Other dramas weave throughout the story, including a secret known only to Will and his best friend (Hallock Beals), a troubled young woman befriended by Ronnie (Carly Chaikin), and that troubled young woman's boyfriend (Nick Lashaway), a good-for-nothing thug who enters and exits every one of his scenes as if he were drunk. Each could have contributed something meaningful had they not been so underdeveloped. A few light hearted moments are reserved for little Jonah, whose precocious dialogue and clever handling of money suggests the filmmakers were not inspired by an authentic ten-year-old. Consider a montage midway through the film, in which Ronnie tries on a number of dresses in a clothing store. In the annals of wardrobe montages, has there ever been one in which a young boy was an active participant?If it seems like I'm ranting, if I'm coming off as bitter and jaded, I'm sorry, but this movie rubbed me the wrong way. Everything about it was just so artificial, and it was all forced upon me. Even the title was an attempt at my heartstrings, which is infuriating because it doubles as the movie's own spoiler. I now realize that Nicholas Sparks is not a master manipulator, because manipulation is by definition underhanded; emotionally, he doesn't want to trick you so much as beat you into submission, and his weapons of choice are formulaic plots with melodramatic turns of events. I can't fault him for being successful at what he does, but I am starting to wonder why so many people are making it possible for him.",2,When Manipulation Fails,1269993600,"03 31,

1355363,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B003NHRIUW,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","When it comes to Nicholas Sparks films, many can expect a romantic film that will literally have the audience laughing, crying and for the most part content with what they have seen.From films such as ""A Walk to Remember"", ""The Notebook"", ""Nights in Rodanthe"" and earlier this year with ""Dear John"", Sparks returns with ""The Last Song"" but interestingly enough, instead of a novel adaptation, Sparks wrote the screenplay for the film in which a novel was created right after the film was done.""The Last Song"" is directed by well-known TV director Julie Anne Robinson (""Grey's Anatomy"", ""Weeds"", ""Samantha Who?"") in her first theatrical directorial debut and the film would be known for bringing Miley Cyrus and current beau Liam Hemsworth together.  The film became a major box office success with a budget at $20 million and bringing in over $88 million.VIDEO:""The Last Song"" is featured in 1080p High Definition Widescren (2:35:1).  Picture quality is good as their is a fine grain that can be seen on the overall print.  There are a lot of daytime scenes showcasing the colors of the blue beach and brown sand as well as the details of the foliage around the beach house and certain scenes in which colors such as reds and ambers really pop.  Night scenes feature dark blacks and for the most part, I didn't notice any edge enhancement, artifacting or DNR.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Last Song"" is featured in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA (48 kHz/24-bit) and a French language track.  The film is primarily dialogue driven and comes clear through the center channel while music and other sound effects can be heard through the front channels.  I didn't notice too much use of the surround channels during the film.  Possibly with crowd ambiance but really, this film is dialogue driven.  You do hear music once in awhile as Ronnie and Will are singing Maroon 5 or hearing Miley Cyrus' ""When I Look At You"" song.  But for the most part, this film is dialogue-driven.Subtitles are presented in English SDH, Spanish and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Last Song"" comes with the following special features in high definition, English 2.0 and subtitles in English SDH, Spanish and French:* Alternate Opening Sequence: The Church Fire (With optional commentary by  director) - (2:55) A Blu-ray exclusive and the sequences is a more lengthy scene of the actual church fire which was trimmed down from three minutes to a few seconds.* Deleted Scenes (With optional commentary by director) - (7:09) A Blu-ray exclusive featuring five deleted scenes which include: Ronnie At The Piano, Steve & Ronnie At The Beach, Hospital Montage, Vegan Cookies, Juggling On The Pier.  There are certain key scenes which I felt that the director didn't trim out of the film.  Especially the first deleted scene.* Audio Commentary- A Blu-ray exclusive audio commentary with Director Julie Anne Robinson and Co-Producer Jennifer Gibgot.  Director Julie Ann Robinson sets up the scene of the film and the decisions that were made for the film.  Especially how hot and unfavorable the conditions were in shooting during the high heat.* Set Tour with Bobby Coleman - (5:08) Audiences will have an all access pass to see how a film is made through the eyes of the new up-and comer and star of The Last Song, Bobby Coleman. This rambunctious eight-year old will bring his fans along as he does everything from interview Adam Shankman and Miley's security team, to going on a seashell scavenger hunt.* Making of the Music Video, ""When I Look At You"" with Miley Cyrus - (4:20) Go behind-the-scenes of the music video, ""When I Look At You"". It will feature recording studio footage, b-roll from the set, interviews with Miley and crew, clips from the film and music video. Audiences will learn how the film's motif, southern summer romance, is incorporated into feel and theme of the music video.* Miley Cyrus Music Video: ""When I Look At You"" - (4:16)  A music video featuring Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth.EASTER EGG:Scroll down on special features selection and you will see a black turtle light up. Click on it and you will access an Easter Egg with commentary by director Julie Anne Robinson. (:21)EXTRAS:""The Last Song"" comes with a slip over case and a bonus DVD.  The DVD is featured in English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and a French language track, Widescreen (2:40:1) - Enhanced for 169 Televisions and is subtitled in English SDH, French and Spanish.JUDGMENT CALL:""The Last Song"" is definitely a Nicholas Sparks film that captures the drama, the happiness of a relationship and the heartwrenching emotions that one can come to expect.  But one thing that ""The Last Song"" unfortunately doesn't have compared to his previous films is a strong dramatic actress.Before I get into Miley Cyrus, let me say that there talent who do make this film quite worthwhile. Greg Kinnear does a fantastic job playing the father, Steve and does a great job of not just the caring father but once the viewer learns about his secret and see how it changes him.  Just the overall transformation of Kinnear's character is impressive and for the most part, one of the his best performances that I have seen from the actor.I also have to say that the young actor Bobby Coleman who plays the young brother Jonah, also did a great job.  Some children are unable to capture the emotion of happiness and sadness and Coleman's performance as a happy and adventurous child is very good but when the story calls for him to be in the lowest of lows and most vulnerable, Coleman does a fantastic job!Although Kelly Preston is in the film, her role as Miley's mother is quite short but at least she is able to provide the stability for Ronnie toward the end of the film (and to think that the director originally cut that scene out from until Preston intervened).But what many people are wondering about this film is Miley Cyrus. Can she pull of a dramatic role?We've seen her play the sad Hannah Montana last year in ""Hannah Montana: The Movie"" and for those who have children or are familiar with her popular teen TV show, we know that she has been playing primarily comedic roles that don't require too much emotion.  The good is that her character Ronnie is a girl who seems displaced in Georgia, a young woman who has so much resentment towards her father and for the most part, Cyrus is able to capture Ronnie's emotions at that beginning first half of the film quite well.  To play a teenage girl who is stand-offish, rebellious and distant, she was able to pull it off.But then, during the second half, this is where the problems begin to happen.  Like many Sparks' films, his films are demanding on the actress.  And for the most part, the actresses on those films literally take command and their heartfelt scenes are dramatic and believable.As Mandy Moore did with ""A Walk to Remember"", Rachel McAdams did with ""The Notebook"" and Amanda Seyfried with ""Dear John"", Cyrus is not at that level as an actress.  What may work on her ""Hannah Montana"" TV shows or her film (which she did have an emotional scene) seems good for ""Hannah Montana"", but for ""The Last Song"", the emotions during those heartwrenching scenes don't seem as natural and free-flowing and comes off more like a staged execution of emotional display when the director yelled ""action"".As for Australian actor Liam Hemsworth, he did an OK job with the character of Will Blakelee but similar to Cyrus, where his experience is primarily TV-based, the more emotional scenes tend to escape him but at the same time, scenes of where he primarily plays the hunky guy around Ronnie and the flirtatious dialogue worked well.  And I will give both Cyrus and Hemsworth credit in that their onscreen chemistry worked well and it's good to hear that their chemistry extended to offscreen as well.""The Last Song"" is a good film but it's a film that is marred by its pacing.  The execution of Nicholas Sparks' ""Dear John"", another film that deals with a short summer between a couple shows how a timeline plays a crucial part in the film.  How we learn how a relationship blossoms within days, weeks, months but with ""The Last Song"", we see Will telling Ronnie ""I Love You"" and the first thing you ask yourself, was this within a day or two of meeting each other, a week?  How can he fall in love that quickly?  Or did a month pass?  So, while you are watching, everything seems like its going too quickly.And last, the biggest criticism, not by me but by the true Sparks' fans who have read the book.  As mentioned earlier, this is the first film by Sparks that came from a written screenplay and then the book was created afterward.  Obviously, having read about the key differences between the book and the film, Sparks found out how to make the story for ""The Last Long"" much more satisfying and essentially much better... after the fact.  Thus the majority of the readers have been overwhelmingly supportive towards the book and less so towards the film.As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is good and what you expect from dialogue-driven film is what I expected in terms of lossless audio.  More center and front channel usage and for the most part, PQ and AQ are good.  There is also a good amount of special features included on the Blu-ray release and you also get a bonus DVD version of the film as well.""The Last Song"" had a story with so much potential but the fact is that Miley Cyrus is trained for television and her emotional acting is at the level of where Hayden Christensen's acting was during ""Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones"", the most emotional scenes seem as if they are rehearsed and not natural.  And the problem is that Cyrus will be compared to other previous actresses from other Sparks' films and unfortunately, compared to them and how they help carry a Sparks' film, Cyrus just doesn't fit into that mold as a dramatic actress.As for Julie Anne Robinson's directorial debut for a feature length film, there is no doubt that Robinson has done a great job as a TV director for major series.  And listening to the commentary of the film, the filmmaker had her share of problems due to the hot weather conditions but I also felt by her comments of times of second guessing with scenes.  The film has this sense of feel as if it was rushed and I don't know how much time she had to work on the film but given on what he she had to work with, Robinson did a good job with her film debut but I felt there were timeline issues with the storyline, second guessing with various scenes (which she ended up trimming and ending up on the deleted scenes, some scenes being put back into the film as mentioned during the audio commentary) and probably aside from the lackadaisical acting, the film also had problems with its screenplay.Sparks is a talented writer but I wonder... What if the film received an adaptation of the actual book that came after the screenplay?  Would it have made for a better film?  I would imagine that is why the book is loved by its readers, Sparks managed to create a coherent, more dramatic story with much better character development.  The way that characters Marcus and Blaze were utilized in the film just seemed a bit off to me and I've read messages from those who read the book that these characters are further explored and make an impact on the storyline.  Thus ""The Last Song"" the book is the true version of how Sparks wanted the story to go and how the characters are utilized.  Reading this, one can easily feel that what we see onscreen is just a distilled version of what Sparks' truly intended.Overall, ""The Last Song"" is truly formulaic and banal film.  Sparks knows how to emotionally capture a crowd, make them laugh and make them cry and is able to pull this off with ""The Last Story"".  Whether or not you came to watch Miley or you want to watch a Sparks' film, ""The Last Song"" is still worthy of a try.  If you are looking for a romantic tearjerker for the end of the summer, definitely give ""The Last Song"" a try.",3,Blu-ray: A Nicholas Sparks screenplay made better with his novel (which came afterward).

1355371,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003NHRIUW,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","Nicholas Sparks has found a formula about teenage angst an finding love despite non-supportive parents: from the number of books and films that use his formula it would seem he has hit pay dirt. THE LAST SONG is Sparks' 14th published novel on the same theme as the preceding 13 and was published in 2009. One year later he transformed that sudsy story (with some help from Jeff Van Wie) into another of his formula films and turned it over to TV director Julie Anne Robinson to map out the predictable story.For a brief outline of the scant story: begin with a divorced family - Ronnie (Miley Cyrus) and her younger brother Jonah (Bobby Coleman) are sent to spend the summer with their father Steve (Greg Kinnear) in an indescribably beautiful waterfront town in Georgia.  Ronnie resents her father and has no intention of being friendly or even talking to him for the summer. But after meeting a handsome guy Will Blakelee (Liam Hemsworth) and beginning to fall in love, Ronnie starts rediscovering her love for music, something she shares with her father. Reconnecting with music revives a kinship with her father which proves to be the most important relationship she may ever experience. And there it is.  Mix the story with the usual acidic girls in  the town who claim Will is a Lothario, overcome that rumor with some all night watches for raccoons who may steal some sea turtle eggs, pop in some father/son meaningful contact, and there you have a Nicholas Sparks formula.Miley Cyrus is Miley Cyrus - and for fans of Hannah Montana that works well.  The light of the film is the screen presence of Liam Hemsworth who looks and acts like someone who will succeed in movies. Otherwise, just be advised that this is another setting for a Nicholas parks  familiar story; if that is to your liking you will like this. If not, then pass.

Daughter gets bumped into at beach by cute vball player, mechanic, animal rights volunteer, Russian speaking (sort of) Tolstoy memorizer that says ""sir"" all the time and has obnoxious snobbish parents (what happened to genetics and learned behavior for developing offspring).(7.) All the other town's teens provide the movie's secondary story by acting like they should all really be the illegitimate children of aforementioned obnoxious parents.Second, the acting and story writing:(1.)

Unbelievable script such as when Miley vacillates within seconds on several occasions between despising and loving the cute guy. Just doesn't fly - it's just fake drama. Or, when Miley is found with a stolen bracelet in purse and doesn't bother to explain to the store that a girl standing a few feet away did it as a prank or to dad who/why it was done.(3.)

In fact, I watched it twice.It has all the good elements that make a romantic movie good, and a few of the expected plot points and storylines, of course. But every bit of it is well done -- from the beautiful cinematography to the honest acting to the tug at your heartstrings moments.I'm not gonna rehash the plot -- there is enough of that in other reviews here. All of the actors large and small ... the young boy is very good ... do their roles proud. And it's not so predictable that you feel you always knows what comes next.It's a chick flick for sure, but you can drag your date to it. He'll like watching Miley while you languish on Liam.

IT NEVER WILL BE. 2 hours is simply not enough time to develop the characters you know and love or include all the events that happen in the book. So that needs to be put aside, or you people need to not read the book before you go see it. I quit doing that mid-Harry Potter series... I realized re-reading the book right before would only add to my disappointment when I saw the movie. Why not be pleasantly surprised when you read the book after seeing the movie?On the note of the actors, Miley has her moments in this movie, but her more tearful moments I found to be laughable. Pushing ""Will"" away? What was that? I do think the scenes she was good in, the scenes with Liam where she is happy, were easy for her, considering she's dating him. In my opinion, she should focus more on music, rather than her acting career. Liam did a good job, he was that cute volleyball player that every girl hopes to have a summer romance with. I didn't love the poor little rich boy approach, I feel like that is fairly overused. That isn't his fault though. The dad and the brother I LOVED. I thought the dad did a good job at being funny and being sick. The brother was that great comedic relief that the movie needed. Very cute. ""Blaze"" and her boyfriend couldn't have annoyed me more, I think that whole extra plot line could have been left out.This movie is a Nicholas Sparks movie, so don't expect something happy, it's not gonna happen.

Instead the mushy love affair between Ronnie and Will is placed as the main theme of the movie.The main theme of the book is about forgiveness and again this is not clearly focused in the movie.The producers could have focused on Ronnie being the caretaker to her ailing father and mentor to her brother which was the main focus at the end of the book. If this was incorporated into the script, Miley's first adult role would really be a great breakout role (something like Kristen Stewart in Into The Wild), but alas the producers prefer to focus on the mushy love affair to attract the post Hannah crowd.No explaination was given on why Ronnie is so angry with her dad (which could have been shown as a flashback and effectively giving an emotional presence to the movie) and Marcus was totally written off the movie.

El-Hewie""","[28, 39]","The Last Song:The first time ever I sat in a movie theater that was packed by teenage girls out numbering others by at least twenty to one.  Having been around teens from divorced parents, I am in good position to spot the weak links in the movie's narrative.  Miley Cyrus fitted perfectly in the role of a troubled and defiant teenage girl who was confrontational, insecure, and very pragmatic.  She succeeded in invoking a sense of anger in her dad, brother, friend, as well as the viewer.  Her growing up troubles must be attributed to her parent's divorce. Her parents are easy targets by virtue of their distance from her.Spending the Summer in Georgia, her trivial altercation in New York added to her Father's being falsely accused by the locals for burning the church.  Getting to know the local teens, she struggled to sort out the honest ones from not so honest.  Like her father, she was set up by an encounter and accused for shoplifting she did not do.  Now, both the daughter and father were stigmatized by the locals for being arsonists and shoplifters.  As if divorce was not enough of strain on their internal affairs that they needed additional pain from outside.The cold and rebellious daughter would make a full turn by a casual hint from a nurse that her father planned his quick death that summer in order to pass away with his children being around him.  With her father's imminent death from lung cancer, the rebellious teen got a jolting effect that will bring her closer to the man she blamed for her misery. The tragic news about her father's terminal illness dwarfed her relentless blaming of the whole world for her growing up struggle.Her caring for turtle eggs being eaten by predator brought her new and expected love that will change her life, but will require fewer challenges before she could learn how not to push people away from her. In contrast to the newborn turtles who were equipped to run to the sea from the moment they hatch, the teen girl must rely on many cues from parents, peers, and otherwise casual encounters in order to get equipped to mature as an adult.Half way through the movie, you quickly find out why teenage girls must love The Last Song.  It is a true and great story about misperception and immature reactions to cues that were deceptive in their outlook and would have been judged differently had the person looked further into the bigger context of affairs. The movie narrative deviated from the provocative and sleazy commercial tricks of sex and violence and presented real people doing real business.An ugly and abusive relation between a bad boy and a girl was presented in a context that justifies its dismal outcome. The classy and casual encounter future boyfriend behaved and thought like what real decent people would do.  Everywhere else, you sense that the moviemaker kept their heads leveled and were appreciated by such massive approval by the teenaged audience.",5,True and great story about misperception and immature reactions to cues.,1270166400,"04 2, 2010",2010,2940,"['Last', 'Song', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'sat', 'movie', 'theater', 'was', 'packed', 'teenage', 'girls', 'out', 'numbering', 'others', 'least', 'twenty', 'one', 'Having', 'been', 'teens', 'divorced', 'parents', 'am', 'good', 'position', 'spot', 'weak', 'links', 'movie', 'narrative', 'Miley', 'Cyrus', 'fitted', 'perfectly', 'role', 'troubled', 'defiant', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'confrontational', 'insecure', 'very', 'pragmatic', 'succeeded', 'invoking', 'sense', 'anger', 'dad', 'brother', 'friend', 'as', 'well', 'viewer', 'growing', 'up', 'troubles', 'must', 'be', 'attributed', 'parent', 'divorce', 'parents', 'are', 'easy', 'targets', 'virtue', 'distance', 'her.Spending', 'Summer', 'Georgia', 'trivial', 'altercation', 'New', 'York', 'added', 'Father', 'being', 'falsely', 'accused', 'locals', 'burning', 'church', 'Getting', 'know', 'local', 'teens', 'struggled', 'sort', 'out', 'honest', 'ones', 'not', 'so', 'honest', 'father', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'encounter', 'accused', 'shoplifting', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'Now', 'daughter', 'father', 'were', 'stigmatized', 'locals', 'being', 'arsonists', 'shoplifters', 'divorce', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'strain', 'internal', 'affairs', 'needed', 'additional', 'pain', 'outside.The', 'cold', 'rebellious', 'daughter', 'would', 'make', 'full', 'turn', 'casual', 'hint', 'nurse', 'father', 'planned', 'quick', 'death', 'summer', 'order', 'pass', 'away', 'children', 'being', 'father', 'imminent', 'death', 'lung', 'cancer', 'rebellious', 'teen', 'got', 'jolting', 'effect', 'will', 'bring', 'closer', 'man', 'blamed', 'misery', 'tragic', 'news', 'father', 'terminal', 'illness', 'dwarfed', 'relentless', 'blaming', 'whole', 'world', 'growing', 'up', 'struggle.Her', 'caring', 'turtle', 'eggs', 'being', 'eaten', 'predator', 'brought', 'new', 'expected', 'love', 'will', 'change', 'life', 'will', 'require', 'fewer', 'challenges', 'could', 'learn', 'how', 'not', 'push', 'people', 'away', 'contrast', 'newborn', 'turtles', 'who', 'were', 'equipped', 'run', 'sea', 'moment', 'hatch', 'teen', 'girl', 'must', 'rely', 'many', 'cues', 'parents', 'peers', 'otherwise', 'casual', 'encounters', 'order', 'get', 'equipped', 'mature', 'adult.Half', 'way', 'movie', 'quickly', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'teenage', 'girls', 'must', 'love', 'Last', 'Song', 'true', 'great', 'story', 'misperception', 'immature', 'reactions', 'cues', 'were', 'deceptive', 'outlook', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'judged', 'differently', 'had', 'person', 'looked', 'further', 'bigger', 'context', 'affairs', 'movie', 'narrative', 'deviated', 'provocative', 'sleazy', 'commercial', 'tricks', 'sex', 'violence', 'presented', 'real', 'people', 'doing', 'real', 'business.An', 'ugly', 'abusive', 'relation', 'bad', 'boy', 'girl', 'was', 'presented', 'context', 'dismal', 'outcome', 'classy', 'casual', 'encounter', 'future', 'boyfriend', 'behaved', 'thought', 'what', 'real', 'decent', 'people', 'would', 'do', 'Everywhere', 'else', 'sense', 'moviemaker', 'kept', 'heads', 'leveled', 'were', 'appreciated', 'such', 'massive', 'approval', 'teenaged', 'audience']",N/A
1355414,A29XWXJ525HH7O,B003NHRIUW,MyD -- The Viewpoint,"[2, 3]","OK,If you are like me, you learned who the writer was.  You heard the back story of how it was written with Miley in mind to star in it, and you thought to yourself ""this has disaster written all over it!""  The marketing ploy was too silly and I think it undermined the success of the movie to some degree.  However, with support from a terrific surrounding cast, this movie manages to overcome a few week points in the script and entertained me far more than I expected.  I only lowered my rating because the script fails to make a compelling case for why Will is so smitten with Ronnie so quickly.  She does a few things as the movie goes on that shows some character, but what he sees early on is nothing but a self absorbed brat who speaks unkindly to those around her. I don't picture Miley as a candidate for Juliard. And, the movie even sets her appearance as a little ratty, not that attractive.  Now all this has a point in setting up the story.  That's fine.  But they should have developed the relationship a little more.  It seems like only a couple of days before they are professing undying love!  That's just rediculous because nothing has happened.  Even the audience can't see what Will sees in Ronnie!All this asside, the performances were strong enough.  It took me 20 minutes to get over Mileys latent country accent she's trying to get rid of and the retainer mouth lisp.  But, I actually think she comes through and moves beyond the cheezy Hanna persona that must go if she is ever to be taken seriously as an adult.  For all of you who are ofended by that, it's OK!  I'm just saying you can't be a child actor forever.  It was a great success for her, now it's time to be more.  I think she is making a better acting transition with more grounding than we have seen in many a younger star's career.  Seriously, with a little speech therapy to beat the country and the lisp out of her and she could use her clout to get some pretty serious roles.  By that I mean gaining range.  She could use the accent when needed, but you can't do other parts when you can't loose the accent.The movie has a positive message though sad tone.  That isn't always the case now days.  I also have to say I was very impressed that they didn't try to beat the audience over the head with Miley songs in the soundtrack.  Many o music stars have made that mistake and ruined movies with cliche.  The soundtrack had terrific songs all the way through and ended with one really strong Miley song that I actually liked!  This movie really could have been a strong 4 stars with just a little tweeking.  I blame the script and director for that.  As a final note, if you don't like slightly smultzy tear jerkers to begin with, this movie never was for you and is not your genre so don't complain.  Just avoid it.",3,DON'T COUNT IT OUT.

They did the best they could with what weak material they had given to them.The positives? The little brother was just adorable...and ok, the fight scene at the wedding was pretty cool! Also, I dug the storyline regarding the sea turtles. Otherwise, the storylines were somewhat predicatable. Must Nicholas Sparks always have someone die in each of his movies?However, there are two specific thing that annoyed me greatly about this movie, and made it just about unwatchable, in my opinion.Flaw #1  The fact that not a single one of the females in this film were nice to each other! I realize it is a romance movie vs a 'buddy' flick, but all that business about how none of the females seemed to like Ronnie, and she had no female friend, was overplayed. Her mother was distant, the other girls were jealous, even the boyfriend's mother was cold to her? Way too much for one movie.Flaw #2  Where were the people of color in this movie? This is GEORGIA for pete's sake. Come on, surely they could casted one or two Black extras in nonspeaking roles at least! We're not talking political correctness.

There are music videos, Making of the Miley Video with Miley  and more  Also a tour of the set with Bobby Coleman (who did NOT make the cover billing).

I probably identify more with the father.Choosing a star rating is hard.. It's a mixed bag. The high star rating is to recommend it to Cyrus' fan base and any teen who ""sorta likes her"" as an actress. (After all Hannah Montana is a role.)

1355432,A2WPAUTK46SQ31,B003NHRIUW,Steven Johnson,"[0, 0]","Let me preface this review by insisting that The Last Song is kind of trash. It is not your everyday studio film, but rather more closely resembling something from the same nest that Lifetime movies are hatched from. It's perfect viewing for a lazy afternoon or a rainy day, but not your typical A-billing feature to impress your friends with.The first half is actually laugh-out-loud bad. It follows a predictable narrative, two kids from a broken home leave their mother's home to spend a summer with their father. The situations and dialogue feel weirdly familiar, probably because we've seen and heard them all before. The sullen, rebellious teen daughter sulks around and runs into the local hunk, who is of course shirtless. The father is clueless about how to raise kids and jokes about the ""handbook"" of paternity. The young son (who is a lousy actor, by the way) raises his eyebrows excitedly at everything, because I guess someone told him that's how you act.Halfway through, though, The Last Song unexpectedly yet satisfyingly switches gears. I don't want to spoil much, but the movie shifts to a more realistic and tragic direction. We get some great moments between Miley Cyrus and Greg Kinnear, filled with sincerity that is lacking throughout the mostly over-the-top script.At its heart, The Last Song could elevate from being an entertaining time-killer movie to being a pretty good or even very good one. It has an engaging enough story, but is weighed down by a terrible script and kind of lousy direction. The opening and closing credits look as though they were made using Windows Movie Maker, and the editing is often awkward and you constantly feel as if you are watching a movie - the illusion of reality very rarely fools the audience.I would probably only recommend this movie to the most hardcore of Miley Cyrus fans, simply for fear that most viewers wouldn't have the patience to sit through the disastrous first hour. For all prospective audience members, however, it is a movie worth sitting through, even if it takes a while to actually get good. The Last Song offers a surprisingly painful yet believable ending that makes up for the wannabe Lifetime flick that precedes it.",4,Great for Miley Cyrus fans; iffy choice if you're not,1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,2206,"['Let', 'preface', 'review', 'insisting', 'Last', 'Song', 'kind', 'trash', 'not', 'everyday', 'studio', 'film', 'rather', 'more', 'closely', 'resembling', 'something', 'same', 'nest', 'Lifetime', 'movies', 'are', 'hatched', 'perfect', 'viewing', 'lazy', 'afternoon', 'rainy', 'day', 'not', 'typical', 'A-billing', 'feature', 'impress', 'friends', 'with.The', 'first', 'half', 'actually', 'laugh-out-loud', 'bad', 'predictable', 'narrative', 'two', 'kids', 'broken', 'home', 'leave', 'mother', 'home', 'spend', 'summer', 'father', 'situations', 'dialogue', 'feel', 'weirdly', 'familiar', 'probably', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'heard', 'before', 'sullen', 'rebellious', 'teen', 'daughter', 'sulks', 'local', 'hunk', 'who', 'course', 'shirtless', 'father', 'clueless', 'how', 'raise', 'kids', 'jokes', 'handbook', 'paternity', 'young', 'son', 'who', 'lousy', 'actor', 'way', 'eyebrows', 'excitedly', 'everything', 'guess', 'someone', 'told', 'how', 'act.Halfway', 'though', 'Last', 'Song', 'unexpectedly', 'yet', 'satisfyingly', 'switches', 'gears', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'much', 'movie', 'shifts', 'more', 'realistic', 'tragic', 'direction', 'get', 'great', 'moments', 'Miley', 'Cyrus', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'filled', 'sincerity', 'lacking', 'mostly', 'over-the-top', 'script.At', 'heart', 'Last', 'Song', 'could', 'elevate', 'being', 'entertaining', 'time-killer', 'movie', 'being', 'pretty', 'good', 'even', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'engaging', 'enough', 'story', 'weighed', 'down', 'terrible', 'script', 'kind', 'lousy', 'direction', 'opening', 'closing', 'credits', 'look', 'were', 'made', 'using', 'Windows', 'Movie', 'Maker', 'editing', 'often', 'awkward', 'constantly', 'feel', 'are', 'watching', 'movie', 'illusion', 'reality', 'very', 'rarely', 'audience.I', 'would', 'probably', 'only', 'recommend', 'movie', 'most', 'hardcore', 'Miley', 'Cyrus', 'fans', 'simply', 'fear', 'most', 'viewers', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'patience', 'sit', 'disastrous', 'first', 'hour', 'prospective', 'audience', 'members', 'however', 'movie', 'worth', 'sitting', 'even', 'while', 'actually', 'get', 'good', 'Last', 'Song', 'surprisingly', 'painful', 'yet', 'believable', 'ending', 'up', 'wannabe', 'Lifetime', 'flick']",N/A

Yey!They didn't focus on her singing and performing too much and made her more of a piano player, but it was the very smallest of features.  She really did a great job.  The story was terrific and I did compare both of N.S's films... this one and ""Dear John"" and the other one doesn't even come close.  Dear John was very slow and I thought terrible, but this one is a first class winner.I hadn't realized Greg Kinnear was in this and of course Kelly Preston who seems to pop up in every other movie in these small (but nice) roles.Fantastic story.Wonderfully made.I give best acting credits to the little kid that played Miley's brother Jonah.
