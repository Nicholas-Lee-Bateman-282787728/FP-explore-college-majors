Although it's humor is aimed towards middle-aged men, I think anyone (including myself-a female in her 20's) can appreciate it. It's kind of like Tool Time (from Home Improvement) meets Bob Villa but crossed with goofiness and humor. This DVD pack is great because it really does have a ton of episodes on it.
