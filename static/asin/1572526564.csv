187864,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,1572526564,Dennis Littrell,"[6, 6]","&quot;You're going to grow up and I'm not.&quot;This is what Ricky Schroth (Kevin Bacon) says to Harriet Frankovitz (Evan Rachel Wood) near the end of the film, expressing both the promise of her life, and the tragedy of his.  It is precisely because of the potential of this sharp spoken, sharp witted, beautiful little girl with a mind of her own that we are mesmerized by her, as we are by our own children, and why we are so deeply saddened by the young man who is not a man and never will be.This is a film that discovers itself after a clumsy start and develops until at the end we see the beauty and the tragedy of its story as an affirmation of life.  Kevin Bacon starts awkwardly and has to work hard to conquer a demanding role.  But so does Wood, who in the beginning at times seemed unsure of who she is and how she should feel and react.  But both actors grow into their characters and become stronger and stronger as the film progresses.  However, I think Director Timothy Hutton (Best Supporting Actor for Ordinary People in 1980) might have profited by re-shooting some of the earlier scenes.It is interesting to compare Bacon's performance with that of other actors who have attempted to play mentally retarded or mentally challenged characters--I'm thinking here of Dustin Hoffman in The Rain Man (1988) and Billy Bob Thornton in Sling Blade (1996).  Dustin Hoffman was of course something close to brilliant in his Academy Award winning role.  He had a charming script, and because he played alongside Tom Cruise he benefitted from not having to carry the picture by himself.  This was not the case for Billy Bob Thornton in Sling Blade, where too much was attempted without enough help so that Thornton ended up too much in front of the camera, and that was not always to his benefit.  Here Bacon is wonderfully supported not only by Miss Wood, but by Mary Stuart Masterson who plays Harriet's &quot;sister&quot; Gwen.  Some people have criticized Masterson's performance, but I think they are reacting to her non-sympathetic character, a woman, who, as Harriet says, &quot;should have been a nurse.  She's always making some guy feel better.&quot;  I think Masterson was very subtle in a unrefined role, and touching as a woman who had a lot to learn.  Also excellent and completely believable in a limited role was Marian Seldes as Ricky's mother.I was surprised that such an original and deeply lived script was not adapted from a novel.  No writer could have just dreamed up this story.  It had to have been lived in some sense.  (Part of it was dreamed up of course.)  So I guess, Karen Janszen, who wrote the script must have lived it.  At any rate, she is to be commended for such an original conception.  The setting in North Carolina at a rural motel (&quot;Mom won it in a divorce&quot;), and the three who ran &quot;Mac's Indian Cabins&quot; was perfect for the tale.  Her celebration of the spirit of a ten-year-old who thinks she can dig to China was precious and warm.  Some of the lines were so perfect.  I am thinking of Harriet's voice over after it is revealed that she and Ricky &quot;got married&quot; (baptized is more like it!).  The ten-year-old says, &quot;Gwen was mostly upset cause I got married before her.&quot;",4,"Flawed, but still touching",983059200,"02 25, 2001",2001,3260,"['quot', ""'re"", 'going', 'grow', 'up', ""'m"", 'not.', 'quot', 'what', 'Ricky', 'Schroth', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Harriet', 'Frankovitz', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'end', 'film', 'expressing', 'promise', 'life', 'tragedy', 'precisely', 'potential', 'sharp', 'spoken', 'sharp', 'witted', 'beautiful', 'little', 'girl', 'mind', 'own', 'are', 'mesmerized', 'are', 'own', 'children', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'deeply', 'saddened', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'man', 'never', 'will', 'be.This', 'film', 'clumsy', 'start', 'end', 'see', 'beauty', 'tragedy', 'story', 'affirmation', 'life', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'awkwardly', 'work', 'hard', 'conquer', 'demanding', 'role', 'so', 'Wood', 'who', 'beginning', 'times', 'seemed', 'unsure', 'who', 'how', 'should', 'feel', 'react', 'actors', 'grow', 'characters', 'become', 'stronger', 'stronger', 'film', 'However', 'think', 'Director', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Ordinary', 'People', '1980', 'might', 'have', 'profited', 're-shooting', 'earlier', 'scenes.It', 'interesting', 'compare', 'Bacon', 'performance', 'other', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'attempted', 'play', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'characters', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'here', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Rain', 'Man', '1988', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Sling', 'Blade', '1996', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'was', 'course', 'something', 'close', 'brilliant', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'role', 'had', 'charming', 'script', 'played', 'alongside', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'benefitted', 'not', 'having', 'carry', 'picture', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'where', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'attempted', 'enough', 'help', 'Thornton', 'ended', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'front', 'camera', 'was', 'not', 'always', 'benefit', 'Here', 'Bacon', 'wonderfully', 'supported', 'not', 'only', 'Miss', 'Wood', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'who', 'Harriet', 'quot', 'sister', 'quot', 'Gwen', 'people', 'have', 'criticized', 'Masterson', 'performance', 'think', 'are', 'reacting', 'non-sympathetic', 'character', 'woman', 'who', 'Harriet', 'quot', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nurse', 'always', 'making', 'guy', 'feel', 'quot', 'think', 'Masterson', 'was', 'very', 'subtle', 'unrefined', 'role', 'touching', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'lot', 'learn', 'Also', 'excellent', 'completely', 'believable', 'limited', 'role', 'was', 'Marian', 'Seldes', 'Ricky', 'mother.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'original', 'deeply', 'lived', 'script', 'was', 'not', 'adapted', 'novel', 'writer', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'dreamed', 'up', 'story', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'lived', 'sense', 'Part', 'was', 'dreamed', 'course', 'guess', 'Karen', 'Janszen', 'who', 'wrote', 'script', 'must', 'have', 'lived', 'rate', 'be', 'commended', 'such', 'original', 'conception', 'setting', 'North', 'Carolina', 'rural', 'motel', 'quot', 'Mom', 'won', 'divorce', 'quot', 'three', 'who', 'ran', 'quot', 'Mac', 'Indian', 'Cabins', 'quot', 'was', 'perfect', 'tale', 'celebration', 'spirit', 'ten-year-old', 'who', 'can', 'dig', 'China', 'was', 'precious', 'warm', 'lines', 'were', 'so', 'perfect', 'am', 'thinking', 'Harriet', 'voice', 'revealed', 'Ricky', 'quot', 'got', 'married', 'quot', 'baptized', 'more', 'ten-year-old', 'quot', 'Gwen', 'was', 'mostly', 'upset', 'cause', 'got', 'married', 'her.', 'quot']",Digging to China

I worked at Santa's Land and was around them for 2 months. Me and my friend watched them do some of the filming at a brown house close to where food lion is inCherokee, NC. The only sad part I waited two years to see this movie and a lot of parts they filmed at Santa's Land they cut out including the extra part I was in. I worked four hours on the set as a extra. It was so fun. They gave me some cool colored shoes to wear and pulled my hair up. I worked as an elf at santa's land everyday so I wore my elf suit in the film but it was like a green dress with no belt.

187869,A39IY0JU5JI69G,1572526564,"Promise ""promise""","[0, 0]","I had never heard of this film and only pulled it off the library shelf because of Kevin Bacon, who always does a good job.  I was very pleasantly surprised to see how good it is.  The story is fairly simple--about a mentally challenged young man who is being taken to a home because his mother is dying of cancer.  Their car breaks down near a motel which is run by an aging beauty who has given in to alchol, her adult daughter and a 10 year old girl.  I won't spoil it by telling you what happens, but I do advise anyone who likes old-fashioned, human interest stories to give this a try.Timothy Hutton does a good job in his directorial debut, avoiding what could have been a terribly bathos-ridden mess.  He must have a good way with actors because the cast was uniformly wonderful here.  The ""mom"" and older daughter could have been shown as one dimensional characters--sort of trailer trash types.  But in spite of what are their obvious flaws, they show genuine love for the youngest girl and the transformation of the older daughter is very beautifully shown.Kevin Bacon did a terrific job in playing the mentally disabled young man.  After about five minutes I forgot it was Kevin Bacon and was thorougly immersed in the character.  It must be very challenging to play such a role without falling into stereotypical gestures and he rose to the challenge.  The scene in which he tells the young girl that she will grow up and he never will is one of the most moving I've seen in a while.Evan Rachel Wood gives a pitch perfect performance as the  tough-tender young girl.  I am reminded of Dakota Fanning's similar role in The Secret Life of Bees, which is also beautifully done. Mary Stuart Masterson is just right as the older daughter.  The woman who plays the dying mother who must give her son over to an institution is remarkable ('wish I could remember her name).  You can feel every pain she must be experiencing even as she underplays it.I don't know why this film wasn't more popular when it came out. It is certainly well done and well worth watching.",5,Very nice small film,1238630400,"04 2, 2009",2009,2070,"['had', 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'only', 'pulled', 'off', 'library', 'shelf', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'who', 'always', 'good', 'job', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'see', 'how', 'good', 'story', 'fairly', 'simple', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'being', 'taken', 'home', 'mother', 'dying', 'cancer', 'car', 'breaks', 'down', 'motel', 'run', 'aging', 'beauty', 'who', 'given', 'alchol', 'adult', 'daughter', '10', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'telling', 'what', 'do', 'advise', 'anyone', 'who', 'old-fashioned', 'human', 'interest', 'stories', 'give', 'try.Timothy', 'Hutton', 'good', 'job', 'directorial', 'debut', 'avoiding', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'terribly', 'bathos-ridden', 'mess', 'must', 'have', 'good', 'way', 'actors', 'cast', 'was', 'uniformly', 'wonderful', 'here', 'mom', 'older', 'daughter', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'one', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'sort', 'trailer', 'trash', 'types', 'spite', 'what', 'are', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'show', 'genuine', 'love', 'youngest', 'girl', 'transformation', 'older', 'daughter', 'very', 'beautifully', 'shown.Kevin', 'Bacon', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'playing', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'young', 'man', 'five', 'minutes', 'forgot', 'was', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'was', 'thorougly', 'immersed', 'character', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'challenging', 'play', 'role', 'falling', 'stereotypical', 'gestures', 'rose', 'challenge', 'scene', 'young', 'girl', 'will', 'grow', 'up', 'never', 'will', 'one', 'most', 'moving', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while.Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'performance', 'tough-tender', 'young', 'girl', 'am', 'reminded', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'similar', 'role', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Bees', 'also', 'beautifully', 'done', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'just', 'right', 'older', 'daughter', 'woman', 'who', 'dying', 'mother', 'who', 'must', 'give', 'son', 'institution', 'remarkable', ""'wish"", 'could', 'remember', 'name', 'can', 'feel', 'pain', 'must', 'be', 'experiencing', 'even', 'it.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'popular', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'certainly', 'well', 'done', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",Digging to China

I'm torn between recommending this movie and protecting people from seeing it because it's so sad.I've read many critics rip up this movie, also claiming Kevin Bacon's performance as being inconsistent, or perfunctory.  All I have to say to that is they were watching KEVIN BACON PLAY A DISABLED PERSON, and did not accept the character for who he was and let the story roll.  I'm sure if DiCaprio played Arnie in Gilbert Grape today after his established fame people would be more critical and see him as the known actor.This slice-of-life picture may seem slow at times, but it adds to the realism of a non-Hollywood blockbuster that tries to cram everything down your throat.  It has a simple calmness to it, a child-like aura.  And speaking of children, Evan Rachel Wood's performance is solid, believable and promises an incredible acting career for her future.  She was a great casting call; not an over-dramatized, rag-dressed victim, but a believable 10-year-old in a small American town.This movie captures the innocent friendship that can exist between an adult and a child, much like Mel Gibson's ""Man without a face,"" as his character was accused and judged for spending time with his student.  ""Digging to China"" will always remain a small film with dust on the sleeve at the video rental store, but I think it surpasses many Hollywood blockbusters that explode special effects and violence for the viewing public that just screams for more.
