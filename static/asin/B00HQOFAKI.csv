All I can really say is that I hope the books are better, (I haven't read them) than the movie is. Except for some blood and mild swearing I'd call this one &#34;Disney does the vampire story&#34;. I don't think it was a matter of budget or writing/direction I just couldn't make myself really enjoy this movie.If you're expecting another &#34;Twilight&#34; (which gets a couple of references in the dialog) forget it- you won't find that here on any level. You get some interesting battle scenes (some better than others) and some other bits but I have a feeling that Vampire Academy sank at the box office because it was missing something- even though author Richelle Mead spoke highly of it during her DVD interview.I wouldn't mind buying the books (I see they're cheaper 1 at a time than in the box set) but I'm hesitant to do that now.

1691512,ALIBRR4PLLLX2,B00HQOFAKI,A Customer,"[1, 2]","I haven't read the books.  I watched this because it looked like a good Vampire Movie.  It was, and more.  This story is part supernatural, part coming of age, part political treachery, and part social warfare.  I loved the 3 different types of vampires.1) The Moroi are the good ones.  They're vampires, but not the undead.  They need blood, but don't kill.  They can endure limited amounts of Sunlight. They're the noble class of Vampires.  I liked how they have powerful magic - over Earth, Air, Fire or Water.2) The Damphirs are half breeds.  Half Vampire and Half Human.  They're the Guardians of Moroi.  They're sworn to protect the Moroi from the Stregoi.3) The Strigoi are the Evil Vampires.  They're the undead - No guilt or Pain and Sunlight is lethal.  It was intriguing that not only can the Strigoi turn both Damphirs and Moroi into Strigio, but also that the Moroi can choose to become Strigoi willingly.The main characters are Rose Hathaway and Lissa Dragomir.  Rose is a Damphir.  Lissa is a Moroi.  They attend the academy together, though their training is quite different.  Lissa is a princess, and has the potential to be more powerful than most Moroi.  Though Rose is still in training she's already Lissa's guardian. They share a special bond.  Emotionally and magically Rose and Lissa are a part of each other.Vampire fans will enjoy  this.

The Guardian Rose is forever talking and talking and not saying much other then how worried she is about her trust. She is a guardian to a Vampire teen of Royal blood. But the movie never really explains what the hell the school is all about other then seeming to be a Hogsworth for vampires. Their are apparently several families of royal blood but it only focuses on the one girl Ilse or something like that.Everything is just there and it has no context so is is more or less a gab fest because their is nothing deeper then the monotonous soliloquy by Rose about a bunch of subjects that are never fully developed.Thank God film makers havent forgotten that Vampires arent pleasant creatures who just happen to suck blood. Vampirism has always been considered a curse on a wicked or sinfull person who then by attacking others draws them into the same living hell.The Vampires of 30 days of night just appeared. But they didnt talk. They were obviously attracted by a place where the sun i gone for a long period and they can feast and fill their bellies with blood like it was Christmas. Because they are true Vampires in every sense of the word, the film dosent explain where they come from or how they are organized. But being true to the myth They are not prissy preening brats but animals, hunters in every sense of the word, thats what they are, thats who they are.Senseless and often irritating, Vampire Academy seems more like a film school students attempts to make a fairy tale with the good Vampires and the Villain Vampires.

I do hope that the makers of this film continues creating more films in this line; as there is depth in this story that contributes to the overall effect of the film/story.

It opens with two teenage girls, Rose and Lissa, on the run somewhere in Oregon. In a snappy opening action sequence, we learn several things: the two girls are vampires with a unique bond; they are absent without leave from a vampire academy hidden somewhere in Montana; and there are three types of vampires, each with their own particular place in the world...Fortunately, the movie takes the first half hour to introduce the characters and the premise to new viewers, before the real story gets underway. The students at Vampire Academy suffer the usual teenage angst, cliques, rivalries, hopes and fears. Their lives are made more complicated by their special powers. Behind that is a dimly seen struggle for power in the vampire realm, a struggle whose dimensions become clear only much later in the story.The spunky, determined Rose (Zoey Deutch) and princess in waiting Lissa (Lucy Fry) are an excellent pairing, backed by a well-cast group of young actors and adults; it would be hard not to get caught up in their story. The action, suspense and humor are good to excellent. The ending is wide open for sequels.

1691543,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00HQOFAKI,FNDNreview,"[7, 50]","Based on the novels by Richelle Mead and directed by Mark Waters (Freaky Friday, Mean Girls), Vampire Academy stars Zoey Deutch as Rose Hathaway a half human/half vampire guardian in training that has bonded and been entrusted to protect her best friend and vampire princess, Lissa (Lucy Fry).  After being on the run, the girls are eventually found and returned to the academy by one of the school&#8217;s guardians, Dimitri (Danila Kozlovsky).Back on school grounds, the girls face dirty looks and ridicule from their peers.  Almost immediately, the girls are faced with numerous threats and are uneasy about certain individuals &#8211; including a secretive vampire, Christian (Dominic Sherwood), a fellow classmate with a grudge, Mia (Sami Gayle) &#8211; not to mention the unpredictable headmaster, Ellen (Olga Kurylenko).  Fortunately, Rose also has the ability to see through the eyes of Lissa&#8217;s eyes and has the ability to be at her side in a moment&#8217;s notice.There&#8217;s no hiding the fact that someone is out to get Lissa &#8211; but nobody seems to be able to figure out the particular reason.  At the same time, there is a threat looming from outside the gate from a different group of vampires &#8211; who are notoriously bloodthirsty.  A mystery shrouds the academy and Rose must do all she can to train and prepare herself &#8211; with the help of her new instructor, Dimitri &#8211; to protect Lissa from any and all impending threats.Please (and I&#8217;m begging when I say this) &#8211; someone explain to me why every time a new supernatural teenager flick gets released, it feels like I&#8217;ve already seen it five times before.  Seriously, this is getting pretty ridiculous.  Is it beyond the ability of authors to come up with fresh ideas?  Is this seriously the future of entertainment?  Twilight is apparently ancient history now &#8211; even though the final film of the franchise was released in late 2012 and Harry Potter a year before that &#8211; so here we are with essentially the same old thing again.  How would I best describe the newest attempt at stealing people&#8217;s money using other people&#8217;s ideas?  Well, I&#8217;d describe Vampire Academy as what would happen if you took Harry Potter, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Twilight and put them all in a blender.Since 1997, there has been 7 seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, 5 seasons of Angel, going on 7 seasons of True Blood, and currently 5 seasons of Vampire Diaries.  With that being said &#8211; anyone that makes the claim that Vampire Academy isn&#8217;t a knock-off of any one of those TV shows (and we haven&#8217;t even gotten to the movies yet) is correct.  Instead, it&#8217;s a collaborative take on washed-up story that&#8217;s been told several times before, told some more, and then told a bunch more times after that.  The characters in Vampire Academy are no more fresh or authentic than a stinky pair of 17-year-old gym shoes.Even though the plot of this film is horribly predictable and about as mysterious as a dog playing fetch, the acting of Zoey Deutch is undeniably commendable.  At first, she comes off a bit overbearing with the amount of chatter she rattles off in the opening scenes, but she will quickly win you over.  Not unlike Kat Dennings from the comedy 2 Broke Girls, Deutch possesses an endless amount of charisma &#8211; not to mention her ability to nail sarcasm is utterly perfect.  Unfortunately, outside of Deutch&#8217;s ambitious performance (and I&#8217;d say her choreography/fighting skills could use some work), the rest of her cast-mates fall completely flat and fail to garner any interest whatsoever.  Apparently, vampires are mostly Russian, though.If you&#8217;re like me and you don&#8217;t wonder into the young adult section of the book store very often (or ever), the Vampire Academy series is comprised of six novels that author Richelle Mead cranked out in roughly three years.  While that&#8217;s all fine and dandy for Mead (who no doubt cashed in after selling 8 million copies), if this first film doesn&#8217;t translate well to moviegoers (and there&#8217;s no indication it will), this will be yet another novel-to-film series that crashes and burns.  It would join recent disappoints that include the film adaptations of Beautiful Creatures, The Host, I Am Number Four and Ender&#8217;s Game &#8211; and to some degree Percy Jackson.Overall, Vampire Academy&#8217;s title basically tells you all you need to know about the film.  It&#8217;s literally a bunch of young adults that go to school (no, it&#8217;s not Hogworts &#8211; although if this group of &#34;Scoobies&#34; ran into the Harry Potter clan, nobody would complain) for mystical training &#8211; which is messed in with a business-as-usual love subplot.  For whatever reason, books of this nature fly of the shelves, even despite the fact that they recycle the same old storyline.  While the star of the film, Zoey Deutch, could potentially have a bright future, it&#8217;s highly unlikely she&#8217;ll have to worry about doing very many more Vampire Academy films.  There is simply not enough here to warrant more, mostly because of the indisputable resemblance of Harry Potter and Twilight.  Fans of the book franchise will likely come to the film&#8217;s defense, but everyone else should feel free to move along to something far less generic and unimaginative.GRADE: D-FNDNreview.com",1,"A

1691544,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B00HQOFAKI,Graves,"[0, 1]","Based on the books of Rachelle Meade, this was obviously done in the hope of starting a film franchise, that having been said it stands alone very nicely and while it isn't Shakespeare it is a lot of fun and if you enjoyed buffy the Vampire slayer, it is sooo for you.Set in our world there are vampires who are good, well they don't feed by killing and have magical powers but aren't all powerful. They feed from willing humans, blood whores, who are happy to get the pleasure from the feeding. There ARE evil vampires,Strigoi, who live by killing and are the sort of vampires you see in books and movies. They're the bad guys. Protecting the good vamps from the bad are Dhampir. Half human stronger and faster than humans without the weaknesses or blood lust of vampires. Vampire academy is home to adolescent good vamps and damphires learning their roles for the future.The story follows Rose  a Dhampir with a particularly tight bond, amazingly tight bond with Lissa, a royal Vampire who might one day be queen. Yeah there are plots of enemies and school pranks and adolescent bs and that is the charming part about it all.

I'm amazed, after the success of YA books turned movies (Twilight, Hunger Games, Divergent) that the filmmakers thought it necessary to market this as such a campy film. Why anyone over the age of 16 would have wanted to see it after seeing the preview is beyond me (I suspect this is why it didn't do well in theaters).But when it came out on DVD, I was willing to watch it. For such a detailed, interesting book this film is a flop. Aside from the over-acted/completely campy aspects of this (really, Mia? I know you're supposed to be a complete wench, but this was just so over the top), it was so rushed. If I hadn't read the books, I doubt I'd have been able to follow much of the plot. And after watching the deleted scenes, the ones with Mrs. Karp would have been very helpful. Considering this movie isn't all that long, it seems weird to me that the filmmakers wouldn't have slowed down the pace a little, in order to make sure the audience got the plot.For example, after discovering Lissa's &#34;spirit&#34; power, the headmaster and Rose want to keep her locked away in a bunker for her safety (because it's obvious someone is after her). But as soon as Natalie brings up shopping, they decide to go and then to go to the dance (without any concern for Lissa's safety).Casting wise, most of the actors were really good. Rose was especially well cast. But Dimitri? So disappointing. Dimitri is one of my favorite YA characters. He's supposed to be the greatest guardian of all time. Completely built, gorgeous and just deadly.

1691570,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00HQOFAKI,Mark Turner,"[0, 1]","Perhaps it's due to my age but I honestly am tiring of the teen movies coming out these days. Even in my twenties I enjoyed the films about that age group better than what's coming out now. Movies like THE BREAKFAST CLUB and even SIXTEEN CANDLES told us more about the teens of the day and their problems than this new crop has done. Today it seems that teens can't face normal problems so we place them in danger via vampires or twisted tales of the future. Of the lot only the HUNGER GAMES films have proven worthwhile. Now we have VAMPIRE ACADEMY, based on the best selling series meant for teens. Even that bothers me knowing that teens would rather read this than things more worthwhile.The story revolves around two friends involved at the Vladamir Academy, the titular location referred to in the title. They live in a world where there is a certain order to vampires. First off is the Moroi, the good vampires, nobles who feed off of willing donors but do not turn them. The Moroi are practitioners of magic involving the elements. They also age and die eventually and aren't as apt to suffer at things like the sun or other folk legends.Those that do suffer from those maladies are known as the Strigoi. These are ex-Moroi who have drained a human being completely thus turning themselves into savage blood draining killers. These are the vampires that we have come to fear. They do avoid the sun and can only be killed with a silver stake through the heart.Lastly there are the Dhampir. These are the offspring of a unification of human and Moroi. The Damphir are raised to protect the Moroi from any evil that might befall them, especially attacks from the Strigoi who seem determined to wipe out all traces of the civilized vampire sect.Now you have the history of the cast of characters in this movie. It's told via narration through Rose (Zoey Deutch), a Dhampir whose best friend also happens to be the next in line for the crown, Lissa Dragomir (Lucy Fry). Not only are the best friends but the two start the movie on the run, having escaped from the Academy. Somewhere along the line they've become bonded and Rose has the ability at times to see through the eyes of Lissa. They're caught and brought home by Dimitri, the best Dhampir, and his crew. Before entering the Academy they are attacked but survive.Once they are home the headmistress of the school chastises them for leaving and placing Lissa in great danger. But she's not the worst problem they face. They now have to return to high school and all that entails, including a young Moroi named Mia who has stolen Lissa's old boyfriend and has now set out to destroy Lissa and Rose's reputations. It's cat fight time at school!As all of this unfolds Rose goes into heavy duty training as a Dhampir. At present she's only a novice, now the time has come for serious training. Between her psychic connection to Lissa and seeing things going on in her life and her attraction to her teacher Dimitri, this isn't going to be easy. It becomes more difficult when strange things begin happening at the school to Lissa including finding dead animals hanging from her door. Someone seems to have their eye set on something dreadful happening to Lissa and now it's up to Rose to find out who.There were too many things I didn't like about this movie to single one out as the worst. The acting was so-so at best. Even Gabriel Byrne as an aging Moroi doesn't come off well. The sets of the film feel fake at every moment. It's as if any blade of grass was astro turf and all the walls look like stage sets from a high school production.Perhaps the worst part of this for me was the story itself. It feels so borrowed, so un-fresh as to be spoiled.  The entire story feels as if a number of other teen centered concepts were placed into a blender and turned on high. From TWILIGHT we have vampires, from HARRY POTTER we have a school and from CLUELESS we have the teen girls banding together to take on a common enemy. To think that this has yielded not one but several books frightens me.The movie ends with a set up for a sequel but I found myself hoping that they didn't make the attempt. I wouldn't want to watch this movie again let alone a sequel. That's saying something because I've always felt that while a first film set up a universe the second always expanded on it. I have no desire to see this one expanded. I don't even think I'll watch this one a second time.Perhaps, as I said at the start, it has something to do with my age. Maybe if I were a teenage girl this movie would hold some sort of attraction for me. Then again the box office numbers for this movie were so distant from that of TWILIGHT that maybe we're in luck and this will be the one and only film those few fans will have.",2,A VAMPIRE MOVIE THAT

I didn't have a chance to do so in the theatre. I brought it while on impulse, which I normally don't if I haven't seen the movie, and given the fact that it was out in DVD so quickly, I was a bit nervous. I am not one that was a big fan of twight, the 2nd book and film sucked, in my opinion (pun intended) and the I kind of felt cheated in the last, although it was alright and I did buy the films, all but the 2nd.  Anyway, back on track, I hadn't read the books and wasn't sure if this was a good buy but I kept the receipt. I really loved the movie, I'm not sure if it was just the different take on the vampire thing or the great acting or the story lines, but I really enjoyed the film. I loved Rose, the main character (one of ) she was witty and kick ass. She reminded me of faith on Buffy and Angel but less crazy.Her friendship with Lissa a vampire princess is great and the icing on the cake is that the mentor that Rose likes is named Dimitri, which is my son's name, spelled the same way...I am conflicted since this guy is absolutely a &#34;god&#34;, this is referenced in the movie a lot. It is funny, witty, action-packed and at times really goes for the heart ( again pun intended). I like vampires and this is a good vampire story. I enjoyed it so much I started reading the books and I have to say, this woman can really write. Way better thatn trying to labor through Twilight....There isn't much blood or bad words and there is one hot scene but there is no nudity, my son enjoyed the movie and I didn't have to make him close his eyes.It really is a good fun movie, I do hope they will make a sequel, it plays up to one, so if they don't I will be a bit disappointed. Well I hope this helps...oh remember this is not Oscar worthy or meant to win any awards, but it is worth the 1 hour and half to watch and I have to admit, I have now watched it several times, mainly because of the humor and there were things I didn't catch before and it stills lives up to a 2nd or 3rd viewing, if you know what I mean. some movies you buy but there are great movies but to watch again you really have to be in the mood, this one is not so, maybe because it is so much fun.

While my sister and I were doing this ridiculous fist bump routine a man down the aisle said (loudly), &#34;I have no interest in seeing that.&#34; Ha! You missed out cranky old man because I loved it!Right off the bat we're hit with background on Richelle Mead's world of vampires. There's no way around a big info dump, so that's fine. Rose and Lissa have a bond beyond the mystical, they're best friends and that comes across in the movie. Dimitri comes across too. Seriously, he has a huge presence in every scene he's in. Lissa's accent took a couple minutes to adjust to and there were a few curious casting choices like fire starter Christian. My version of him is a tad less hot, or at least much angstier. And my version of Christian does not have an accent unless you consider hostility an accent.The mystery isn't so mysterious since I read the books. There's a bully lurking around campus writing threatening messages in blood. And there's an awful classmate. She's more on the pipsqueak side of things. I really hated her in the books, but I just wanted to put her in a time-out in the movie. Rose has some terrific lines and delivers them perfectly. I loved the self-deprecating humor, that was spot on with the books.If you're a die hard VA fan, I'm not sure what your take on the movie will be. There are a couple change ups and like always some of the best parts are either cut or abbreviated, but Rose rocks and she is the star. Dimitri makes you swoon. Lissa can be annoying, but she annoyed me in the books too. Christian needs a shirtless scene in the next movie. I think the action and storyline will only get better over the span of the movie franchise if there will be a movie franchise. There is no lurking scene after the credits roll, but I wanted one because I wanted more. That says a lot right there.

I liked who was cast (despite the nay-sayers) and the special effects were pretty good for a middle budget film. The editing helped with the story. The lead teen girls had a connection that felt natural. Lots of action, some comedy.My issue with this film is that it follows the book too closely. How can this be an issue? The key plot & world-building points are introduced by pieces/flashbacks and not in a chronological order. This can be very confusing if someone has not read the book. (Thank goodness I've read the series).While the production kept many lines from author Rachel Mead (props for that), they did a poor job with explaining her world until after you're about 15 minutes in.  It would have been better if the entire film was done in chronological order of events. Even if they made up a few scenes--introducing the school life first (maybe introduce key characters), explaining how the &#34;good&#34; vampires control the elements (but the co-star is unsure of herself & wonders why she's failing to have a single element), why the girl running away (needs to break from book and show the reason so audience understands a huge plot point instead of waiting half-way through the film) and  about what life was outside of the academy (they did some of that).ALL OF THAT would have been smoother for an explanation for an uninitiated audience. Another example--a random cursed item is introduced as a gift. Even though the editing is well done to hint that it's the item causing behavior, what could have been better is actually hinting that someone is cursing the item and thus the audience gets a hint that the item is what's causing the characters to behave strangely.This whole film has a very modern TV quality and I am not surprised if many of the tech come from that cinematography background.

Rose, a rebellious guardian-in-training, and her best friend, Lissa, a royal vampire princess, escape from the school but are captured and returned to the very place where they believe their lives may be in jeopardy.Thrust back into the perils of Moroi society and high school, Lissa struggles to reclaim her status while Rose trains with her mentor and love interest, Dimitri (Danila Kozlovsky), to guarantee her place as Lissa&#8217;s guardian. Rose will go to any extreme to protect Lissa from those within the Academy walls who intend to exploit her and from the Strigoi (immortal, evil vampires) who hunt her kind from outside its sanctuary.This is another picture based on young adult fiction that combines teenage angst, romance, and supernatural creatures.
