455960,AGEIT17HENDIS,6305248036,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","I have been on something of a Humphrey Bogart tear of late. And when I get on the occasional tear I tend to grab everything of an author, singer, artist, or actor in sight. And hence this review of very much lesser known Humphrey Bogart film, Call It Murder.  If you are looking for the Humphrey Bogart of  To Have or To Have Not,  Casablanca, The Big Sleep or even The Petrified Forest then you will be disappointed. Bogart plays a relatively minor role as, well what else, a second- rate cheap hoodlum whose heading out of town fast, or so that is his plan. So no one should be offended if you pass this one by.Pass by is what I originally intended  to do as  well except when I thought about it this film is actually a very good example of the kind of social film critique that was popular and produced during the turbulent and trying 1930s. The subject here is the death penalty, its application, and its basic appropriateness in an evolving progressive society (or that has pretensions to civilization). The plot line centers on a woman who has killed her abusive husband when he was going to run out on her leaving her high and dry. At trial the foreman of the jury, a self-righteous and upright citizen, persuades his fellow jurors that she is guilty of murder one, and hence headed for the electric chair. Since there was no ""battered person"" defense then she was convicted and sentenced to die.The dramatic tension of the film comes when that self-righteous juror is bombarded with pleas from all kinds of sources to call for sparing her life. He maintains his stance and she is executed. And here is where Bogie comes in. He has been seeing the juror's daughter, she has fallen in love with him, and as mentioned before, he is ready to fly to the coop. Naturally she is ready to move might and main to keep him in the coop. Well one thing leads to another as they do with thugs and he is shot to death. She thinks that she has done it in a rage at his leaving. She runs home to dear old dad and tells her story. Hey, she is up for murder one and the chair too, right?  No way in the end of course but the old man has to confront, or rather we have to confront, that little moral dilemma when thing hit just a little to close to home.Good thoughtful social critique on the death, agreed?  Yes, although I should note that this film is one of those 1930s Theater Guild productions which tended, as this film, does to be rather heavy-handed and didactic in making its important point. Thus the dialogue, the staging, and the acting are rather stilted for today's audiences. Still it mad that nice social commentary. Just don't see for the Bogie part, okay.",3,Out  In The 1930s Film Noir Night,1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,2663,"['have', 'been', 'something', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'tear', 'late', 'when', 'get', 'occasional', 'tear', 'tend', 'grab', 'everything', 'author', 'singer', 'artist', 'actor', 'sight', 'hence', 'review', 'very', 'much', 'lesser', 'known', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'film', 'Call', 'Murder', 'are', 'looking', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Have', 'Have', 'Not', 'Casablanca', 'Big', 'Sleep', 'even', 'Petrified', 'Forest', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Bogart', 'relatively', 'minor', 'role', 'well', 'what', 'else', 'second-', 'rate', 'cheap', 'hoodlum', 'heading', 'town', 'fast', 'so', 'plan', 'So', 'no', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'offended', 'pass', 'one', 'by.Pass', 'what', 'originally', 'intended', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'thought', 'film', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'example', 'kind', 'social', 'film', 'critique', 'was', 'popular', 'produced', 'turbulent', 'trying', '1930s', 'subject', 'here', 'death', 'penalty', 'application', 'basic', 'appropriateness', 'evolving', 'progressive', 'society', 'pretensions', 'civilization', 'plot', 'line', 'centers', 'woman', 'who', 'killed', 'abusive', 'husband', 'when', 'was', 'going', 'run', 'out', 'leaving', 'high', 'dry', 'trial', 'foreman', 'jury', 'self-righteous', 'upright', 'citizen', 'fellow', 'jurors', 'guilty', 'murder', 'one', 'hence', 'headed', 'electric', 'chair', 'was', 'battered', 'person', 'defense', 'then', 'was', 'convicted', 'sentenced', 'die.The', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'film', 'when', 'self-righteous', 'juror', 'bombarded', 'pleas', 'kinds', 'sources', 'call', 'sparing', 'life', 'stance', 'executed', 'here', 'where', 'Bogie', 'been', 'seeing', 'juror', 'daughter', 'fallen', 'love', 'as', 'mentioned', 'ready', 'fly', 'coop', 'Naturally', 'ready', 'move', 'might', 'main', 'keep', 'coop', 'Well', 'one', 'thing', 'do', 'thugs', 'shot', 'death', 'done', 'rage', 'leaving', 'home', 'dear', 'old', 'dad', 'story', 'Hey', 'up', 'murder', 'one', 'chair', 'too', 'right', 'way', 'end', 'course', 'old', 'man', 'confront', 'rather', 'have', 'confront', 'little', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'when', 'thing', 'hit', 'just', 'little', 'close', 'home.Good', 'thoughtful', 'social', 'critique', 'death', 'agreed', 'Yes', 'should', 'note', 'film', 'one', '1930s', 'Theater', 'Guild', 'productions', 'tended', 'film', 'be', 'rather', 'heavy-handed', 'didactic', 'making', 'important', 'point', 'Thus', 'dialogue', 'staging', 'acting', 'are', 'rather', 'stilted', 'today', 'audiences', 'Still', 'nice', 'social', 'commentary', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Bogie', 'part', 'okay']",Call It Murder

I can remember being in amateur theatricals like this when I was about 16 or 17. The director has a few visual ideas; eg, the wooden bars of a staircase banister turn into the iron bars of the condemned cell. Not that there's a lot of point to that one. The upshot of the story is that it's right to pursue the letter of the law, no matter how unpopular it makes you, or how strong your psychological empathy with the accused --- even if she's your own daughter. Quaint, in a way. Yes, Bogart is in it, just about.

Is there such a genre'?The foreman of the jury that convicts the women is a tortured  soul. So is his daughter. She seems to have internalized the condemned woman's plight. The foreman also seems to be very chummy with the prosecuting DA. The daughter is in love with a shady character. That where Bogart comes in. At this point it's really no spoiler to discover he has been murdered. That very night he decides to dump her. She doesn't take it well. She confesses the whole thing to her family. Her father the foreman calls the DA. Still that night he comes right over. They begin to spin her confession. To have a women murder her lover the same way on the same night another women is being executed is very dicey for the foreman as well as the DA. Especially if it is the foreman's daughter. That's it in a nutshell. Good late night fare.,3,A women has been convicted of first degree murder.

This is an early film featuring Bogart that would surely be forgotten if he wasn't in it. The other actors are melodramatic and the story, even with its ""twist"" ending, is a bit too mechanical to enjoy. Bogart is the best thing about it, but people didn't seem to realize it at the time and his role is not that big. As usual at this time he played a gangster type, and I don't want to give anything away, but I swear that Bogart got shot to death more than any other actor in the 1930s!I'm a huge Bogart fan and I've sought out anything I could find with him.
