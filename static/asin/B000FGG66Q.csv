By fluke, a recently deceased woman found his diary and helped to shed light on this topic.I had known that French female orphans were sent to Quebec to be wives and maids for colonists centuries ago.  However, I didn't know that the US had an adoption plan that crossed vast boundaries, in the past.  This disc covers many questions that would concern adoptions of any kind.  Were some children picked over others?  Were adoptive parents grateful or abusive?  Did the children want to be adopted?  What happened when things didn't work out between child and potential parents?  It'll warm your heart to see that some adoptees truly found love and shelter.  Still, this work was realistic enough to talk of children that were abused and practically enslaved, though the work never say anything on the topic of sexual molestation.Another thing this work NEVER mentions is RACE.  Though it notes that the children were often a different ethnicity and religion than the English-descended, Protestant, adoptive parents, it fails to note that every child here was white.  Did the philanthropist who started the program not care about black orphaned children?  Did blacks have ways of adopting children that was unlike that of whites?  (Is that why the 1980s film ""Annie"" only had white girls in it?)  Though fictional, ""Gangs of New York"", based during the same time period, mentioned a black orphanage.  So there were parentless black children at that time.  It's possibly unjust that their stories were not brought up here.  Also, the work talks of children being suspected of having ""bad blood"" (totally unrelated to STDs) from their parents, yet the word ""eugenics"" never comes up.The migration of human groups fascinates me.  I recently saw a documentary on how English women were shipped to Australia in its colonial days.  I am the proud descendant of African Americans who moved during the Great Migration of the early to mid-1900s.  Modern immigration is what is changing the birth rate and ethnic make-up of modern America.  If mass migrations fascinate you too, then you may really benefit from seeing this work.",3,an adoption system of the past,1160265600,"10 8, 2006",2006,2250,"['1850s', '1920s', 'philanthropist', 'sent', 'orphaned', 'poor', 'children', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'farms', 'Midwest', 'West', 'fluke', 'recently', 'deceased', 'woman', 'found', 'diary', 'helped', 'shed', 'light', 'topic.I', 'had', 'known', 'French', 'female', 'orphans', 'were', 'sent', 'Quebec', 'be', 'wives', 'maids', 'colonists', 'centuries', 'ago', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'US', 'had', 'adoption', 'plan', 'crossed', 'vast', 'boundaries', 'past', 'disc', 'many', 'questions', 'would', 'concern', 'adoptions', 'kind', 'Were', 'children', 'picked', 'others', 'Were', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'grateful', 'abusive', 'children', 'want', 'be', 'adopted', 'What', 'happened', 'when', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'child', 'potential', 'parents', ""'ll"", 'warm', 'heart', 'see', 'adoptees', 'truly', 'found', 'love', 'shelter', 'Still', 'work', 'was', 'realistic', 'enough', 'talk', 'children', 'were', 'abused', 'practically', 'enslaved', 'work', 'never', 'say', 'anything', 'topic', 'sexual', 'molestation.Another', 'thing', 'work', 'NEVER', 'mentions', 'RACE', 'children', 'were', 'often', 'different', 'ethnicity', 'religion', 'English-descended', 'Protestant', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'note', 'child', 'here', 'was', 'white', 'Did', 'philanthropist', 'who', 'started', 'program', 'not', 'care', 'black', 'orphaned', 'children', 'Did', 'blacks', 'have', 'ways', 'adopting', 'children', 'was', 'whites', 'why', '1980s', 'film', 'Annie', 'only', 'had', 'white', 'girls', 'fictional', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'based', 'same', 'time', 'period', 'mentioned', 'black', 'orphanage', 'So', 'were', 'parentless', 'black', 'children', 'time', 'possibly', 'unjust', 'stories', 'were', 'not', 'brought', 'up', 'here', 'Also', 'work', 'talks', 'children', 'being', 'suspected', 'having', 'bad', 'blood', 'totally', 'unrelated', 'STDs', 'parents', 'yet', 'word', 'eugenics', 'never', 'up.The', 'migration', 'human', 'groups', 'recently', 'saw', 'documentary', 'how', 'English', 'women', 'were', 'shipped', 'Australia', 'colonial', 'days', 'am', 'proud', 'descendant', 'African', 'Americans', 'who', 'moved', 'Great', 'Migration', 'early', 'mid-1900s', 'Modern', 'immigration', 'what', 'changing', 'birth', 'rate', 'ethnic', 'make-up', 'modern', 'America', 'mass', 'migrations', 'fascinate', 'too', 'then', 'may', 'really', 'benefit', 'seeing', 'work']",N/A

It is to his credit that the Children's Aid Society still operates to this day and this is a `must see' piece of American history for everyone.",5,EVER SO POWERFUL,1396483200,"04 3, 2014",2014,796,"['Replete', 'photos', 'letters', 'first-hand', 'stories', 'children', 'who', 'rode', 'trains', '1800', 'documentary', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'fail', 'touch', 'heart', 'now', 'aged', 'people', 'speak', 'experiences', 'where', 'came', 'where', 'ended', 'up.This', 'hour', 'DVD', 'PBS', 'Home', 'Video', 'story', 'incredible', 'beginnings', 'Children', 'Aid', 'Society', 'NYC', 'minister', 'Charles', 'Brace', '1853.While', 'now', 'clear', 'not', 'children', 'were', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'have', 'happy', 'endings', 'Mr.', 'Brace', 'intended', 'idea', 'was', 'doubt', 'brilliant', 'one', 'came', 'most', 'sincere', 'concern', 'less', 'fortunate', 'credit', 'Children', 'Aid', 'Society', 'still', 'day', 'must', 'see', 'piece', 'American', 'history', 'everyone']",N/A
989776,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000FGG66Q,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[30, 30]","American Experience - The Orphan Trains tells the story of how The Children's Aid Society was formed in 1853 to help poor and often homeless children in New York City get a better life by sending them on long train rides to more rural parts of our nation. It was thought that if the children could escape the city they would have a better chance at a happy, normal life. We see how Charles Loring Brace founded the society when the only help available for children was a type of ""orphan asylum"" in which the children were taught skills so that they could earn money.Brace desperately wanted a better way to help these children; he and his peers did not believe that the orphan asylums were teaching skills valuable enough to truly help the children. This program changed the lives of so many children--between 1853 and 1929, more than 150,000 abandoned, abused and orphaned children were taken from a life of poverty usually while living on the streets and begging for money, and sent, more often than not, to relatively stable homes where they could have a much better sense of family.On the down side, however, children were essentially rounded up (the film doesn't say exactly how) and sent forcibly to other parts of the country by train where they hopefully had a real chance at a better childhood.  Of course there's more to the story but I don't want to spoil it for you so I'll leave the rest out. You can rest assured that if this topic interests you, you won't be bored watching this film!The real electricity of the film comes from invaluable interview footage in which now elderly people who rode orphan trains tell their most personal stories about their experiences both good and bad. The emotions these people display truly moved me and I could see that in some ways The Children's Aid Society had helped some while it had been insensitive to the emotional needs of other children.The DVD comes with few extras; there is a type of advertisement for other features of the Public Broadcasting System website but unfortunately that's about it. However, this film is so good I can overlook it. Another reviewer mentions the fact that the photos and stories of these children are about white children only--what happened to African-American children and children of other races? I would have liked to know.American Experience-The Orphan Trains is quite a powerful story and I recommend this for anyone interested in this topic.",4,the remarkable story of the orphan trains and the children who rode them,1258502400,"11 18, 2009",2009,2437,"['American', 'Experience', 'Orphan', 'Trains', 'story', 'how', 'Children', 'Aid', 'Society', 'was', 'formed', '1853', 'help', 'poor', 'often', 'homeless', 'children', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'get', 'better', 'life', 'sending', 'long', 'train', 'rides', 'more', 'rural', 'parts', 'nation', 'was', 'thought', 'children', 'could', 'escape', 'city', 'would', 'have', 'better', 'chance', 'happy', 'normal', 'life', 'see', 'how', 'Charles', 'Loring', 'Brace', 'founded', 'society', 'when', 'only', 'help', 'available', 'children', 'was', 'type', 'orphan', 'asylum', 'children', 'were', 'taught', 'skills', 'could', 'earn', 'money.Brace', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'better', 'way', 'help', 'children', 'peers', 'did', 'not', 'believe', 'orphan', 'asylums', 'were', 'teaching', 'skills', 'valuable', 'enough', 'truly', 'help', 'children', 'program', 'changed', 'lives', 'so', 'many', 'children', '1853', '1929', 'more', '150,000', 'abandoned', 'abused', 'orphaned', 'children', 'were', 'taken', 'life', 'poverty', 'usually', 'living', 'streets', 'begging', 'money', 'sent', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'relatively', 'stable', 'homes', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'much', 'better', 'sense', 'family.On', 'down', 'side', 'however', 'children', 'were', 'essentially', 'rounded', 'up', 'film', ""n't"", 'say', 'exactly', 'how', 'sent', 'forcibly', 'other', 'parts', 'country', 'train', 'where', 'hopefully', 'had', 'real', 'chance', 'better', 'childhood', 'course', 'more', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'so', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'rest', 'out', 'can', 'rest', 'assured', 'topic', 'interests', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'bored', 'watching', 'film', 'real', 'electricity', 'film', 'invaluable', 'interview', 'footage', 'now', 'elderly', 'people', 'who', 'rode', 'orphan', 'trains', 'tell', 'most', 'personal', 'stories', 'experiences', 'good', 'bad', 'emotions', 'people', 'display', 'truly', 'moved', 'could', 'see', 'ways', 'Children', 'Aid', 'Society', 'had', 'helped', 'had', 'been', 'insensitive', 'emotional', 'needs', 'other', 'children.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'type', 'advertisement', 'other', 'features', 'Public', 'Broadcasting', 'System', 'website', 'unfortunately', 'However', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'can', 'overlook', 'reviewer', 'fact', 'photos', 'stories', 'children', 'are', 'white', 'children', 'only', 'what', 'happened', 'African-American', 'children', 'children', 'other', 'races', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'know.American', 'Experience-The', 'Orphan', 'Trains', 'quite', 'powerful', 'story', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'interested', 'topic']",N/A

This documentary shows photos of the children and bits of interviews with now elderly men and women who lived through this experience.
