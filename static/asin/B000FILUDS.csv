I rented this knowing that it looked like B(more like F) horror trash. Knowing I would get a kick out of it though, I figured why not. When the first scene begins with a shot at the house the words coming from my mouth where ""No way in hell"" simply because I couldn't believe that the camera quality was so bad. When I say it's bad, I mean it's ""home video of your 6th birthday"" bad. Also, this is probably the worst acting i've ever seen. My brother and I couldn't stop laughing at the police  chief for the lack of emotion he put into his character. Also, Angie's friends have to be the least intelligent people put into film. Which leads us to another thing. The storyline. I won't bother to explain the horrid plot, being that others have already but it is so random and just bad. I mean, even the kills were in the wrong order. Stars of the movie were being killed off quicker than the extras. Also, there is no ending.It's just a random scene. Nothing happens. Don't buy this unless you want a good laugh. A bad movie with nothing but a dumb killer, nu-metal/stoner guys, preps and a fat ugly goth chick (who sadly and I mean sadly you see nude in this film) Enjoy.",1,Wow just wow.,1154908800,"08 7, 2006",2006,1272,"['did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'could', 'buy', 'something', 'much', 'better', '23', '+', 'dollars', 'rented', 'Blockbuster', 'rented', 'knowing', 'looked', 'B', 'more', 'F', 'horror', 'trash', 'Knowing', 'would', 'get', 'kick', 'figured', 'why', 'not', 'When', 'first', 'scene', 'shot', 'house', 'words', 'coming', 'mouth', 'where', 'way', 'hell', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'camera', 'quality', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'When', 'say', 'bad', 'mean', 'home', 'video', '6th', 'birthday', 'bad', 'Also', 'probably', 'worst', 'acting', 'i', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'brother', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing', 'police', 'chief', 'lack', 'emotion', 'put', 'character', 'Also', 'Angie', 'friends', 'have', 'be', 'least', 'intelligent', 'people', 'put', 'film', 'Which', 'thing', 'storyline', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'explain', 'horrid', 'plot', 'being', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'so', 'random', 'just', 'bad', 'mean', 'even', 'kills', 'were', 'wrong', 'order', 'Stars', 'movie', 'were', 'being', 'killed', 'off', 'quicker', 'extras', 'Also', 'ending.It', 'just', 'random', 'scene', 'Nothing', 'happens', 'Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'want', 'good', 'laugh', 'bad', 'movie', 'nothing', 'dumb', 'killer', 'nu-metal/stoner', 'guys', 'preps', 'fat', 'ugly', 'goth', 'chick', 'who', 'sadly', 'mean', 'sadly', 'see', 'nude', 'film', 'Enjoy']",N/A

As soon as we put the DVD in it was ridiculously bad. Credits roll in the beginning for about 8 hours, then a cheaply made movie shows up with really bad makeup and special effects. A middle schooler could have made better film. on top of the HORRIBLE beginning with the overuse of fake blood and sausages there was wayy too much talking. We havent finished the movie, just watch the first 20 minutes and thought why would we waste our lives watching the movie. went back to blockbuster and got our money back and rented another GOOD horror film.",1,It was a cheap high school video project..,1180742400,"06 2, 2007",2007,748,"['friends', 'were', 'blockbuster', 'thought', 'ok', 'randomly', 'pick', 'movie', 'was', 'Mr.', 'Jingles', 'video', 'cover', 'looked', 'scary', 'storyline', 'sounded', 'decent', 'went', 'ahead', 'rented', 'As', 'soon', 'put', 'DVD', 'was', 'ridiculously', 'bad', 'Credits', 'roll', 'beginning', '8', 'hours', 'then', 'cheaply', 'made', 'movie', 'up', 'really', 'bad', 'makeup', 'special', 'effects', 'middle', 'schooler', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'film', 'top', 'HORRIBLE', 'beginning', 'overuse', 'fake', 'blood', 'sausages', 'there', 'was', 'wayy', 'too', 'much', 'talking', 'havent', 'finished', 'movie', 'just', 'watch', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'thought', 'why', 'would', 'waste', 'lives', 'watching', 'movie', 'went', 'back', 'blockbuster', 'got', 'money', 'back', 'rented', 'GOOD', 'horror', 'film']",N/A
