E Jackson,"[1, 1]","As you're probably well aware (since everyone was talking about this movie a few years ago) Teeth is about a teenage girl who has actual teeth deep inside of her private parts.  This means whenever a sexually active young man wants to have sex with her, you can probably guess what happens to his ding dong and the agony that soon follows.  The best scene however, is the one that involves the doctor doing an examination that is, shall we say, a little *too* thorough!Anyway there's numerous other problems with this girl and especially her dysfunctional family.  Her father is timid, her mother is physically weak and dying of something that was never made clear, and her brother is the biggest jerk ever.  Well apparently the teeth inside the girls private area grow stronger and hungrier over time, and yeah, the hunger reaches a point of STRONG desirable lust towards men.It's a whacky concept, but a daring and original one too.  Overall the pacing is really slow-moving and quiet but that's probably the charm of the movie.  The storyline is probably slightly undeveloped.  I mean the girl DID have a few scenes where she was crying because she was overly concerned this problem would only escalate and she didn't know how to stop it, but nothing serious or conclusive ever came of it.  The ending is pretty good but it's also how I thought things would wrap up.  Nothing surprising about the ending at all.Well it is how it's described, haha.  Nothing's really offensive.  Well I mean, other than the chopping and massacring of susceptible dingalings.

McGraw,"[3, 6]","I cannot think of another film that takes such a ballsy approach to exploring the almost entirely ignored world of women afflicted with vagina dentata. The fact that analysis and documentation of this terrible affliction is so sparse is obviously a stark reminder of the iron fist of patriarchy that crushes the vocal chords of women trying to speak out about this condition.This film follows the struggle of a young woman who was a strong proponent of the abstinence movement, following in the footsteps of such luminaries as Sarah and Bristol Palin. Like Bristol, her conviction is swayed, for just a brief moment, however instead of the conception of a child turning her world upside down, it is the evolution of her genitalia that pushes her life in a direction she never would have imagined.While struggling to deal with the horrors of natural selection and Darwinism and the stark contrast they hold to her conservative Christian upbringing, she must also fend off the unwanted advances of multiple men. Andrea Dworkin argued that all heterosexual sex in our patriarchal society is coercive and degrading to women, and sexual penetration may by its very nature doom women to inferiority and submission, and ""may be immune to reform."" She essentially pointed out that penetrative intercourse is rape, and she was obviously correct based on how many times the protagonist of this film is faced with degrading situations. Not only must she deal with the knowledge that societal structure is designed to denigrate her through sex, but she must also cope with her physical condition.In a stunning turn of events, one that will cast her among feminist icons spanning multiple generations, the subject of this film choose to view her condition not as a liability, but as a tool. A tool to aide her in her vigilanteism, dare I be so crass as to say she literally ""takes a bite out of crime"" ? Well, it is true, she does, and in doing so she turns the tables on misogyny and ableism.This is absolutely a film that should be shown to all children and young adults struggling with feeling different. It candidly discusses sex, rape, abstinence, ableism, religion, puberty, and the struggles of being a handicapable teenager.

I can't really go into detail about the film as it is of a very explicit nature but the myth of vaginas having teeth is bigger than most people will first know. It's actually called Vagina Dentata and is a mythology based on female empowerment, and although there have never been literal medical cases of toothed vaginas, it's a very literal mythology and something that a lot of remote cultures still hold this myth to be true.The whole movie is something that doesn't hold back, after all when you're making a movie about a girl with a toothed vagina you can't really hold back too much in what you show. Most will really put down this film without thinking too much about the actual content itself. From the start of the film this is simply a film about sexuality as a whole and how, even those who have taken an oath of abstinence have the sexual temptation and how they may not be able to resist that temptation. It actually gives us a true image of how men and women actually see sex and sexuality in quite a similar way, it puts up a mirror to our society and shows that although in public we may say something differently, we actually all have the same urges and temptations. This is also a film about respect and boundaries and the result of the sex scenes in this movie with the castration element, I can imagine a lot of men will think twice before they disrespect women in a sexual way.With the intelligence of it, there's also a bit of a ""that's a bit too much"" element to it and although with a movie like this you have to have the graphic scenes, there were points when you felt certain elements were unnecessary and were simply there for gross out value.

1140616,A3IBYRSA490ZOA,B0013D8L7M,C. Chow,"[5, 8]","`Teeth' is one of those films I must admire while at the same time feel frustrated that such a terrifying concept was not executed better.I am reminded of Hitchcock's famous quote that a bomb exploding is not suspenseful; a bomb not exploding is suspenseful because we are afraid that it will. `Teeth' gives away too much too soon and provides too many answers. Likewise with the excessive blood, seeing severed body parts is not frightening because we know they're fake. Not showing us lets us imagine an image far worse than anything FX could produce. The unknown is far scarier.The premise itself is enough to horrify and intrigue one to see this film. In case you haven't figured it out from the trailers and the reviews, `Teeth' tells the story of teenage virgin with vaginal teeth. As I said it gives away too much too soon.Despite its flaws `Teeth' is absolutely terrifying and passed the horror movie test of causing me to loose sleep. Probably the best element is the characters themselves. These teenagers actually look and act like real teens not horror movie bimbos. Dawn is extremely likable with her down to earth good looks. She doesn't look like she has someone style her hair and make up for 100K every hour. Dawn lives with her mother, stepfather, and scumbag, junkie, punk stepbrother. Dawn's main activity is being the spokes person for promise rings. Children promising to remain chaste (even with themselves) until marriage and boasting a ring to prove it. Most of these children seem far too young to even know what sex is or what they're promising, Dawn is one of the few teens in the organization. Unlike other poorly written films these scenes do not patronizingly mock Christians but adorn them.Dawn's horrific and inevitable self discovery does not come about as expected. As she and her boyfriend take things further and further the date switches to a rape. That in itself is frightening.While many critics are placing `Teeth' in the category of shameless blood soaked teen slasher flicks it is far more as it explores the horror concept of becoming that which you most fear. A monster at your door? Kill it. But what if you're the monster? Dawn has no one to turn to. There are no support groups and a trip to a gynecologist becomes a nightmare. It reminded me of `Devil Lady' where people around the world are becoming monsters. Everyone is too frightened of themselves to deal with the problem. How would they deal with it? Her body and her memories will never leave her.`Teeth's atmosphere is also surprisingly realistic making the impact of the theme all the more terrifying. Similar to `Donnie Darko' or `Carrie' Dawn's life is far from the materialistic teen world of MTV. Dawn already has plenty of real problems.`Teeth' is extremely disturbing with an enthralling main character. I couldn't take my eyes off it.As I said my only real frustration with the film is that it had the potential to be twice as good by doing more with less. We don't need all these bloody scenes. The concept itself already has us horrified. All this blood just degrades `Teeth' into the slasher category.Likewise the opening scene shows the toddler step siblings in a pool where little brother puts his finger where it doesn't belong and gets bitten. I would think this would be more likely to happen to Dawn during the course of her life. This scene is pointless and we do not need to see toddlers sexually molesting each other.Rational explanations. We are constantly reminded of a nuclear power plant looming above killing Dawn's mother with cancer. While some have said this is symbolic it gives too easy an explanation for why Dawn is deformed. No answer would be far more frightening. Some of the scariest stories ever, never divulged their biggest secrets. `Flowers In The Attic' we never found out how many people were in on holding the children prisoner or why their mother agreed to this. It was about more than money. `The Exorcist' why was Regan possessed? Never revealed. `Battle Royale' how was the villain Kazuo able to withstand deadly gunshots and other wounds without flinching? Never revealed. `V For Vendetta' (the comic not that crappy film) who was V? Was he really Evy's father. I think so, but there was no confirmation.",5,Ouch!

Nevertheless this movie is one of those that even though you're repulsed by it's first impression, you can't help but be curious as to what the movie truly is. So with quirky feelings I sat down to watch this movie, and found it to be pretty good. I must say that &#34;Teeth&#34; is one of those movies where I had to stop and have a long thought about it. My final verdict a very fun, and clever movie. The acting from Jess Wexler especially is great, and even if the surrounding cast was a bit lackluster, it was still presentable. I must say some things could have been done a little better, and I was very disappointed in the surrounding story elements. Like when it wasn't dealing with the absolute main premise(when it was presented in big climax situations) the story became very plain, and even somewhat predictable. However &#34;Teeth&#34; entertains and gives you something new and fresh that you won't be seeing in a while. Overall even if you did or didn't like &#34;Teeth&#34;, you have to appreciate it's strangeness, and originality.

I own a copy of ""Killer Condom"", and I thought this flick would possibly be similar, but actually it's not.  Basically the charming, hopefully sweet Dawn is saving herself for marriage.  Well,she's so cute what guy wouldn't want to ask her out, so of course we have a conflict.  Dawn finds herself having feelings for Toby.  When she gets him alone at last, the results are disastrous.  The thread starts to unravel as Dawn finds out her special ""secret"".  Actually it ends up being a great source of distress for Dawn and you really feel sorry for her.  Dawn confides in another guy who she thinks is her friend, but he was just using her for a bet.  Then there is her maniacal step-brother who wants a piece of the action as well.  It seems like every encounter poor Dawn has with the opposite sex ends up in murder.  Towards the end Dawn seems to accept the fact that she can't change anything, and actually uses her ""secret"" to exact revenge on her step-brother.  This movie had an interesting enough plot that it will make the viewer want to see it all the way through.  I was pleased that this was so smart and the laughs are mostly situational.  This was dark comedy done well.  I'm also glad that this didn't turn into a dull, typical slasher flick that I just wanted to fast-forward through.  I'm sure that every girl in the world has at one time pondered the best revenge on a guy, whether it be a boyfriend or a tormenting jerk at school.  In fact, I think any girl who is going through a tough time with a guy like that and needs a motivational boost, should probably rent ""Teeth"", for a good, wicked laugh.

While I must give the writers some points for creativity, the execution was poor and left me sadly disappointed. The story development didn't engage me in any sense- I didn't find it funny, creepy, or amusing (some combination of these emotions are the general response, I've heard) and I am still to this day wondering why I sat the entire film out to the end. (I know; to say I watched it and join in the conversation.) What was perhaps most disappointing (second only to the ending of the film) was the fact that Dawn's actions never made any sense. (And yet somehow the movie wound up incredibly predictable.)  I'm sincerely hoping I was just the 'wrong' audience for this film, because I did not find it to have a single impressive moment. (However, again, my friends seemed to like it.)Other thoughts: I would have been more upset by the sexualization of adolescents if the film didn't appear at least predominantly oriented toward a teenage audience; I was generally frustrated by the portrayal of Christians (though I've come to see most efforts to save sex for marriage almost as strange as the film portrayed them); I was frustrated by the portrayal of males and masculinity; I was upset by the way the film seemed to trivialize something as important as rape; and there were no 'feminist' vibes whatsoever, despite popular claims.

Abstinence before marriage is such a strong value for her that she even teaches abstinence to high school kids.One day, while on a date with a so-called nice guy who claims to share the same values as her, this guy reveals his true self by raping her.On that day, both Dawn and her rapist discover that she has an extra set of teeth between her legs.And on that day, she literally takes a bite out of crime...Lorena Bobbitt style.It's never explained how she got these teeth, but I'm assuming it's because her family lives close to a power plant and the toxic chemicals caused her body to mutate.  Another explanation is given during a teacher's lecture in class...the teacher is not directly talking about Dawn, however, the explanation still relates to Dawn's situation.This movie is advertised as a comedy, but it contains some graphic sexual and violent scenes not typically seen in comedies.  Although you never see Dawn's extra teeth down below, you do see the gory aftermath.  A scene I thought was over-the-top disgusting (and the reason I gave this a lower rating) was the scene with the dog and Dawn's brother.  The lower rating is also due to the corniness in some scenes.This movie has a ""girl power"" kind of feel to it, so I expected this to be written and directed by a woman.  Instead, to my surprise, it's both written and directed by a man.

No, I don't mean that it's such a good film that saying it's a bad movie will destroy all your credibility of a film critic or ""that guy at the bar that knows everything about movies."" I mean, you have to love this movie for fear of being labeled a sexist, or racist, or a fascist because it is such great social commentary.Just think, if Thelma and Louise had Cameron Diaz and Tori Spelling as the lead roles, the story-line still would have called for recognition, and anyone who thought it was bad would be labeled an instant ""woman-hater."" In horror, the movie ""you had to love"" not too long ago was Ginger Snaps. Why? Because someone thought of the already rehashed idea of using the menstrual cycle in comparison to lunar cycles and threw a werewolf story into it? Didn't they already do that horribly in An American Werewolf in Paris? But if you say anything bad about Ginger Snaps, you aren't ""sympathetic to the plight of women.""(Yes, an actual quote from someone on an online message board.) What about that smorgasbord of a film Crash? I happen to like that movie, but there were plenty of annoying plot jerks that I'm sure a few people in the world didn't care for it. Does that mean they're racist? No.Which brings us to today's sociological experiment of a film, Teeth, directed by Mitchell Lichtenstein. The plot of this movie is simple: We have a film sequence of a soon-to-be happy family of two broken families, with a step-brother and step-sister playing in the pool underneath a view of a nuclear power plant. The children play ""doctor,"" and the boy's finger is cut by an unknown source. Ooooooh, the suspense.Present day: a teenaged girl, Dawn(played by Jess Weixler), proudly struts her virginity, and is the spokes-person for some fanatical anti-sex group that advocates no sex before marriage. Yes, they wear little rubber-band rings as their ""promise"" not to have unclean thoughts, because they're married to Jesus or something.Enter Tobey(played by Hale Appleman), who is supposed to be some stand-up Christian boy. To me it looks like he decided to follow Dawn around, and B.S. her about how he's saving himself for marriage and such to get in her pants. So Dawn and Tobey begin ""dating,"" which means holding hands, blushing when Tobey gives Dawn a peck on the cheek, and swimming in one-piece bathing suits. Hows 1950's-ish. Finally, Tobey has enough of his whole ""no sex"" lie, and attempts to rape Dawn. The attempt ends with Tobey screaming, Dawn screaming, Tobey disappearing, and a great shot of Tobey's severed penis on the ground. Uh-ooooh, seems like Dawn has a little problem. No WONDER she was a no-sex advocate.Dawn becomes depressed, and reads all about the legend of the vagina dentata. She goes to visit a gynaecologist about this, Dr. Godfrey(played by Josh Pais). The gynaecologist turns out to be male and, of course, a pedophile, which is o-k since he gets his. His fingers are cut off by Dawn's va-jay-jay, and she runs away.Dawn goes home and finds her Mom half-dead on the floor, and her step-brother banging his girlfriend.(Side note: he's scared of the va-jay-jay). She runs off, into the arms of some guy named Ryan. He drugs her up, and they have sex, safely! The next morning they are about to bump skins again, but Ryan does bad by answering the phone while they're going at it and it turns out Ryan was trying to sleep with Dawn on a bet, so Dawn's hoo-hah has another snack.Dawn becomes comfortable being some sort of super-heroine, and decides to go after her brother Brad. Apparently Brad only likes anal sex with women, but Dawn coerces him to have normal intercourse, which ends with Brad bleeding all over the place and his dog chewing on his severed penis. I'm sorry for the long synopsis, but I felt it was necessary, since one of my problems with this film was plot structure. I forgot that it wasn't A-B-C simple.Portrayed as a horror/black comedy, the film Teeth works on a few levels. The idea of sex as a weapon, as much as it has been done, is always great for a few laughs if done correctly. Yes, in this instance correctly could mean having a penis-eating vagina. I can even look past Tobey hounding after Dawn, and never really being abstinent. The abstinence club itself is ridiculous, in the comical way, not the annoying way.The penis shots were the only visually horrific spots of the movie. It wasn't done as a pornographic depiction. They were more like props, especially since they were not attached to their hosts, ever(visually).So what is it about this movie that irks me? The story is a bit slow for a horror movie. This can be problematic to some viewers. Normal horror aficionados want a lot of blood and gore, and this movie doesn't deliver too much. At the same time, the gore that is there may disgust drama and black comedy buffs. This movie is good, but inconsistent with itself. It's not a good genre jumper, like Shaun of the Dead or Severance. I think it may end up alienating more genre followers than entertaining.The biggest problem I have with this movie is minor, but detracts from the film in a major way. Each part of the movie, introduction, Act 1, Act 2, and Climax, are bookmarked by these stupid-looking smoke-stacks from, we're guessing, a nuclear power plant. I don't like things sketched out this precise, especially when it has nothing to do with the story. There is no mad scientist at the plant trying to create the perfect woman, or penis and vagina monsters. If you want to say ""Hey look, nuclear pollution created Dawn's hoo-hah demon!"" then say it once, and be done with it. If the viewer is intelligent enough to swim through your muddled storyline, I'm sure they can figure out your ""Nucleer Powr Iz BADD"" premise.",2,Insert Vajayjay Reference Here,1262044800,"12 29,

Seeing the previews months before hand I couldn't wait to grab hold of this and thanks to my Amazon friends who had already watched and rated this reminded me how anxious I wanted to see this. If films couldn't get any more bizarre imagine a strain of VD so powerful that one encounter with a carrier essentially kills you. The rub is that in this case, VD stands not for venereal disease but rather for the Latin "" vagina dentata,"" e.g. ""toothed vagina."" If Russ Meyer had made this film, it would have been called Faster, Pussy! Kill! Kill! As it stands, the only real precursor to Teeth is a 2003 low-budget British comedy-horror film with the unlikely title of Penetration Angst.That's certainly what some male viewers may feel after watching Teeth. The three main scenes of phallus interruptus leave nothing to the imagination and give a whole new meaning to the porn industry term `money shot.' Taken together, they add up to an experience that is tantamount to the ""anti-date movie."" Seriously, even if a female companion was hot to trot after the show, it's likely her male movie going pal would be too freaked out by all the slicing and dicing to take her up on it.Unlike Fiona Horsey, the talented newcomer who has done nothing of note since the aforementioned Penetration Angst, the Juilliard grad star of Teeth, Jess Weixler, is already headed for bigger things. By sheer coincidence, today is the day casting was confirmed for the movie version of Peter and Vandy, Jay DiPietro's adaptation of his popular 2002 play of the same name. DiPietro co-starred as Peter, but in this case it's Jason Ritter who will have the honors opposite Weixler.Teeth is very much a cult movie, a horror comedy to be devoured by thrill seeking genre fans. It's likely that Peter and Vandy will be more the kind of movie that really introduces Weixler to a wide audience, making good on the promise of her Special Jury Prize at last year's Sundance Film Festival (""For a juicy and jaw-dropping performance""). Still, her fearlessness in Teeth is to be commended. She dives into the role with abandon and is even willing for the sake of the film to do a revealing topless scene in this, her first major movie role.Most people will know Weixler from a MasterCard TV commercial in which she plays a gal with a new job who, a la Mary Tyler Moore, skips about town while flaunting its features.

1140645,A28GCEHD00JFZG,B0013D8L7M,Julian Kennedy,"[3, 3]","Teeth: 5 out of 10: This is the second [...] dentata film I have seen; it is unfortunately the lesser effort. This despite tremendous guerilla marketing campaign that could make one think this is the first cinematic foray into such a taboo subject let alone the greatest horror film since 'Sliced: The Baker of Bread'.The film spends its first half an hour on a lightweight parody of the Teen Chastity movement complete with the wearing of red rings to show that they are pledged virgins. In a creepy post release twist, the chastity group is called Promise and uses something that resembles the Obama presidential red O as its symbol. I am not sure this is what the Obama campaign had in mind.After a half an hour of jabs at the religious right and nuclear power, (Cooling towers are ominously and unscientifically billowing black smoke behind our protagonist's house.) The film segues into the feminist revenge film we all paid good money for.Needless to say, hormones being what they are, the dentata enabled virgin (Jess Weixler) finds herself getting hot and heavy with her born again virgin boyfriend (Hale Appleman). When he takes her no to mean yes and attempts to date rape her... well her teeth go to work and Appleman finds himself short one manhood.Do remember that film when the guy loves the girl and she betrays him so he cuts her [...] with a broken beer bottle, killing her, and the audience cheers him on? No? I don't either. Because they never made that film... and if they did, audiences would burn down the theater. Welcome to the double standard. And don't get me wrong, I approve of this particular double standard in theory, but the misandry of this film is overwhelming. Add in some unsubtle homosexual subtext (and gratuitous male nudity both membered and dismembered) and one gets the idea that the film is against heterosexual intercourse in general. This ironically gives it the same moral compass as the Chastity Group it mocks. This is simply forced chastity from the other side.The problem is poor direction by Mitchell Lichtenstein. His tone is all over the place and sloppy. If he wants his protagonist to seek out lovers then kill them for imagined slights (as she does later in the film) shouldn't the film reflect this change from victim to predator?Director Lichtenstein also wastes a tremendous performance by John Hensley as Weixler's older, evil brother. Hensley creates a character of true banal evil. A stupid selfish bad guy that feels like a very real person. His scenes are the best in the film, yet the climatic denouement is simply more of the same and honestly does not feel true to the character. (This would have been a perfect time for the film to put in a twist such as incestuous [...] sex.)The films performances are overall quite good with Jess Weixler and Hensley as the standouts. The film is also extremely graphic with various male gentalia being sliced and gaping bloody wounds in the crotch area. (Not for nothing but would not a male member lose its erection if severed?)Unfortunately, Teeth, much like that recent killer baby flick Grace, ends where it should have begun. If you want to see a Vagina Dentata film done right, take a gander at Angst (Or Penetration Angst, as it is known overseas.).

I've always wanted someone to make a film about this...and now that they have, I really wish they hadn't.What I was hoping to take seriously just came off extremely juvenile, not scary in the least and really NOT funny. The jokes, the puns and the put downs were all SO horribly unfunny that I just sat there completely bored the entire time. The effects were awful as well. It all looked SO fake and cheap. Not to mention the so called ""scary parts"" were few and far between. I do applaud them for not actually showing her vagina, I was hoping they wouldn't, to give a little mystery. After everything else I saw, I was sure they would and I just knew it would look terrible. But really...they may as well have.I understand that, given the subject matter, it would be pretty hard...however, I hope the next time someone makes a movie about this, its done in a much better, funnier, more serious and dramatic type of way.

The movie has two awful kids playing the heroine and her stepbrothers as children, but after they age into high schoolers (though both of them have got to be 30, surely?) the picture improves no end.  Dawn has matured into one of the Promise Ring girls like the cheerleader who got pregnant on GLEE and had to give up her baby.  An unfortunate series of circumstances leads Dawn to discover that she has had a horrid trick played on her by biology....  And the plot of the movie is basically how she comes to terms with her discovery.  In CARRIE the storyline pretty much had Carrie cracking up when her powers took over, destroying sll that she loved along with herself.  In TEETH the ending is a bit more optimistic.  It's sort of like CARRIE rewritten to allow for that thing with feathers Emily Dickinson called ""hope.""Jess Weixler is astoundingly good as Dawn, maybe almost as good as Sissy Spacek was in the original, only the movie itself lets her down here and there.

Hensley filled out quite a bit in this from when he was young, lean and androgynous as the son in NIP/TUCK, and he looks like an overweight Frank N. Furter--like Meat Loaf playing Frank N. Furter.  He does a good job with the part, but he's the freak of nature, not Dawn, and whenever he's onscreen you can't look away, in horror, the way people used to look at Laird Cregar in the Fox horror films of the 1940s, there's got to be something medical that makes John Hensley look as weird as he does, and he can't have long to live, poor boy.",4,Whitest Teeth You'll Ever See,1295136000,"01 16, 2011",2011,1972,"['thought', 'one', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'too', 'gross', 'watch', 'wife', 'ordered', 'reluctantly', 'set', 'watch', 'TV', 'tray', 'covering', 'genitals', 'movie', 'two', 'awful', 'kids', 'playing', 'heroine', 'stepbrothers', 'children', 'age', 'high', 'schoolers', 'have', 'got', 'be', '30', 'surely', 'picture', 'end', 'Dawn', 'matured', 'one', 'Promise', 'Ring', 'girls', 'cheerleader', 'who', 'got', 'pregnant', 'GLEE', 'had', 'give', 'up', 'baby', 'unfortunate', 'series', 'circumstances', 'Dawn', 'discover', 'had', 'horrid', 'trick', 'played', 'biology', 'plot', 'movie', 'basically', 'how', 'terms', 'discovery', 'CARRIE', 'storyline', 'pretty', 'much', 'had', 'Carrie', 'cracking', 'up', 'when', 'powers', 'took', 'over', 'destroying', 'sll', 'loved', 'along', 'TEETH', 'ending', 'bit', 'more', 'optimistic', 'sort', 'CARRIE', 'rewritten', 'allow', 'thing', 'feathers', 'Emily', 'Dickinson', 'called', 'hope', 'Jess', 'Weixler', 'astoundingly', 'good', 'Dawn', 'maybe', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'was', 'original', 'only', 'movie', 'down', 'here', 'there', 'never', 'did', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Tobey', 'mystery', 'missing', 'body', 'Was', 'supposed', 'make', 'wonder', 'moment', 'Dawn', 'was', 'crazy', 'BLACK', 'SWAN', 'crazy', 'things', 'had', ""n't"", 'happened', 'awfullest', 'thing', 'was', 'casting', 'John', 'Hensley', 'sadistic', 'bored', 'stepbrother', 'Hensley', 'filled', 'out', 'quite', 'bit', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'lean', 'androgynous', 'son', 'NIP/TUCK', 'overweight', 'Frank', 'N.', 'Furter', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'playing', 'Frank', 'N.', 'Furter', 'good', 'job', 'part', 'freak', 'nature', 'not', 'Dawn', 'onscreen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'away', 'horror', 'way', 'people', 'used', 'look', 'Laird', 'Cregar', 'Fox', 'horror', 'films', '1940s', 'got', 'be', 'something', 'medical', 'John', 'Hensley', 'look', 'as', 'weird', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'long', 'live', 'poor', 'boy']",N/A

The image (and the movie) are as cartoonishly ominous as live action filmmaking can get without being totally ludicrous.  The plot, too.Dawn is a rare breed, you see.  She's a fierce (but lovely) promoter of abstinence, a hottie who's not into the naughty.  Her ideals are made about as creepily cartoonish as the plant behind her house, as she and her uber-Christian pals debate whether or not they should see a PG-13 film.  (""There's probably some hardcore making out,"" she ponders with a sour look on her pretty face.)  When she falls for the floppy-haired Ryan (oh, he of the soft-spoken regrets and tender idealisms), she discovers, during an ill-fated swim, that she is of an even rarer breed than the Love Can Wait (For A Legally Binding State Document) variety.I won't tell you what breed she is, but her clumsy awareness of it kinda ... well, bites.  As Dawn is forced to deal with the circumstances of her volatile teenage body (hers among the more volatile I've ever seen), she must simultaneously put up with an unending barrage of horny sleaziness.  Men can be such pigs.I was reminded, as I watched the film, ofHard Candy.  That movie has the same sort of attitude as TEETH, but HARD CANDY's smug self-righteousness (and lopsided ""plotting"") ended up creating a vaguely pornographic anti-fantasy that I found disingenuous and self-defeating.  TEETH, on the other hand, takes the concept of women's rights and makes it both funny and interesting, and although the gore and nudity might lead some to think it's trying for titilation, I find it hard to believe any right-thinking man or woman will be turned on by this thing.The unfortunate thing is that, with all the possibilities available for a story of this type, TEETH fails in one of the same ways HARD CANDY did.  It becomes just about flipping a razor-edged bird to arrogant, selfish horndogs everywhere.  Good for them, I'd say; guys like that will never reach the limit of their comeuppance.  But it doesn't exactly make for solid storytelling.Aside from the occasionally satisfying scene and Jess Weixler's stunningly assured performance of Dawn, this movie is mostly just a joke-inspired ""what-if"" that doesn't have the legs or the guts to be anything other than a disturbing concept.  Even if it doesn't have legs or guts, though, it's got another body part.One with bite.",3,Take A Bite Out Of Slime,1232323200,"01 19, 2009",2009,2464,"['Dawn', ""O'Keefe"", 'house', 'two', 'Simpsons-esque', 'power', 'plant', 'stacks', 'rise', 'gushing', 'out', 'feathered', 'cotton', 'candy', 'smoke', 'image', 'movie', 'are', 'cartoonishly', 'ominous', 'live', 'action', 'filmmaking', 'can', 'get', 'being', 'totally', 'ludicrous', 'plot', 'too.Dawn', 'rare', 'breed', 'see', 'fierce', 'lovely', 'promoter', 'abstinence', 'hottie', 'who', 'not', 'naughty', 'ideals', 'are', 'made', 'creepily', 'cartoonish', 'plant', 'house', 'uber-Christian', 'pals', 'debate', 'not', 'should', 'see', 'PG-13', 'film', 'probably', 'hardcore', 'making', 'out', 'sour', 'look', 'pretty', 'face', 'When', 'floppy-haired', 'Ryan', 'oh', 'soft-spoken', 'regrets', 'tender', 'idealisms', 'ill-fated', 'swim', 'even', 'rarer', 'breed', 'Love', 'Can', 'Wait', 'Legally', 'Binding', 'State', 'Document', 'variety.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'breed', 'clumsy', 'awareness', 'well', 'bites', 'Dawn', 'forced', 'deal', 'circumstances', 'volatile', 'teenage', 'body', 'hers', 'more', 'volatile', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'must', 'simultaneously', 'put', 'up', 'unending', 'barrage', 'horny', 'sleaziness', 'Men', 'can', 'be', 'such', 'pigs.I', 'was', 'reminded', 'watched', 'film', 'ofHard', 'Candy', 'movie', 'same', 'sort', 'attitude', 'TEETH', 'HARD', 'CANDY', 'smug', 'self-righteousness', 'lopsided', 'plotting', 'ended', 'up', 'creating', 'vaguely', 'pornographic', 'anti-fantasy', 'found', 'disingenuous', 'self-defeating', 'TEETH', 'other', 'hand', 'concept', 'women', 'rights', 'funny', 'interesting', 'gore', 'nudity', 'might', 'lead', 'think', 'trying', 'titilation', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'right-thinking', 'man', 'woman', 'will', 'be', 'turned', 'thing.The', 'unfortunate', 'thing', 'possibilities', 'available', 'story', 'type', 'TEETH', 'one', 'same', 'ways', 'HARD', 'CANDY', 'did', 'just', 'flipping', 'razor-edged', 'bird', 'arrogant', 'selfish', 'horndogs', 'everywhere', 'Good', ""'d"", 'say', 'guys', 'will', 'never', 'reach', 'limit', 'comeuppance', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'make', 'solid', 'storytelling.Aside', 'occasionally', 'satisfying', 'scene', 'Jess', 'Weixler', 'stunningly', 'assured', 'performance', 'Dawn', 'movie', 'mostly', 'just', 'joke-inspired', 'what-if', ""n't"", 'have', 'legs', 'guts', 'be', 'anything', 'other', 'disturbing', 'concept', 'Even', ""n't"", 'have', 'legs', 'guts', 'though', 'got', 'body', 'part.One', 'bite']",N/A

The movie is titled TEETH and it concerns the adventures of a young girl reaching womanhood who...well lets start at the beginning.Dawn (Jess Weixler) is a young teen who has pledged herself to celibacy. Part of an organization called The Promise, Dawn and her friends have pledged to abstain from sex until they are married, dealing with the ridicule other teens toss their way. The first segment of the film strays into insult territory of groups that make these pledges. But as the film progresses, it makes sense so stick with it.The pledge to hold on to her virginity becomes more difficult to keep with the arrival of a new boy in town, Tobey (Hale Appleman). The attraction between the two is painfully obvious. Along with another couple, the teens are exposed non-stop to the sensual ads seen on billboards, movies that offer titillation and over exposure to all things sexual. It's only a matter of time before they make the decision to go for it.But it's not the romance that Dawn expected. They sneak off to a secluded falls notorious for make out couples. Swimming into the cave behind the falls, Tobey begins to struggle with Dawn, resulting in her hitting her head. As he forces himself on her physically she wakes, screams and a crunching noise is heard. When Tobey stands, screaming out loud, we are see he is bleeding and missing the weapon of choice he had used to attack Dawn.This is where the movie gets its title. Yes, it appears that Dawn has teeth located in her most private of areas. Later in the movie we learn that this is a common tale in mythology known as the vagina dentate (check online, it's real). Unsure of what to do, Dawn returns home leaving the offensive appendage at the cave.Struggling with what to do, Dawn rides her bike across town to a doctor to be examined. Unfortunately for this doctor, he tends to abuse hid position. This in turn results in Dawn removing several of his fingers.While all of this is happening, Dawn finds no one to talk to. Her mother is in the midst of dying, her step-father is dealing with the same situation and her step-brother is a totally worthless waste of humanity who thinks only of himself...and of Dawn in an unbrotherly way. Dawn finds comfort in the arms of another young man from school, Ryan (Ashley Springer).Things go fine between the two as he offers her a consoling ear to listen and a romantic evening that results in her first real experience where nothing happens. But, when he reveals that it was all to win a bet...CHOMP.How Dawn finally deals with everything from her mother to her step-brother to her own awakening sexuality makes for a funny film. The metaphors of teenage years and dealing with puberty run rampant. Granted it's not for everyone. But fans of films from Troma, off kilter warped comedies, strange movies and more will want to seek this one out.It does fit the category of the company putting it out (Dimension Extreme) and is most definitely not for children. But if you approach it with an open mind, knowing what to expect, it offers some truly hilarious scenes. Not for the easily offended or squeamish, if something different is what you seek on DVD, then this one is right up your alley.",4,COMEDY WITH A BITE,1214524800,"06 27, 2008",2008,3285,"['are', 'movies', 'released', 'are', 'description', 'one', 'close', 'movie', 'titled', 'TEETH', 'adventures', 'young', 'girl', 'reaching', 'womanhood', 'who', 'well', 'start', 'beginning.Dawn', 'Jess', 'Weixler', 'young', 'teen', 'who', 'pledged', 'celibacy', 'Part', 'organization', 'called', 'Promise', 'Dawn', 'friends', 'have', 'pledged', 'abstain', 'sex', 'are', 'married', 'dealing', 'ridicule', 'other', 'teens', 'way', 'first', 'segment', 'film', 'insult', 'territory', 'groups', 'make', 'pledges', 'film', 'sense', 'so', 'stick', 'it.The', 'pledge', 'hold', 'virginity', 'more', 'difficult', 'keep', 'arrival', 'new', 'boy', 'town', 'Tobey', 'Hale', 'Appleman', 'attraction', 'two', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'couple', 'teens', 'are', 'exposed', 'non-stop', 'sensual', 'ads', 'seen', 'billboards', 'movies', 'offer', 'titillation', 'exposure', 'things', 'sexual', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'make', 'decision', 'go', 'it.But', 'not', 'romance', 'Dawn', 'expected', 'sneak', 'off', 'secluded', 'notorious', 'make', 'out', 'couples', 'Swimming', 'cave', 'falls', 'Tobey', 'struggle', 'Dawn', 'resulting', 'hitting', 'head', 'physically', 'screams', 'crunching', 'noise', 'heard', 'When', 'Tobey', 'screaming', 'out', 'loud', 'are', 'see', 'bleeding', 'missing', 'weapon', 'choice', 'had', 'used', 'attack', 'Dawn.This', 'where', 'movie', 'title', 'Yes', 'Dawn', 'teeth', 'located', 'most', 'private', 'areas', 'Later', 'movie', 'learn', 'common', 'tale', 'mythology', 'known', 'vagina', 'dentate', 'check', 'online', 'real', 'Unsure', 'what', 'do', 'Dawn', 'home', 'leaving', 'offensive', 'appendage', 'cave.Struggling', 'what', 'do', 'Dawn', 'bike', 'town', 'doctor', 'be', 'examined', 'Unfortunately', 'doctor', 'abuse', 'hid', 'position', 'turn', 'results', 'Dawn', 'removing', 'several', 'fingers.While', 'happening', 'Dawn', 'one', 'talk', 'mother', 'midst', 'dying', 'step-father', 'dealing', 'same', 'situation', 'step-brother', 'totally', 'worthless', 'waste', 'humanity', 'who', 'only', 'Dawn', 'unbrotherly', 'way', 'Dawn', 'comfort', 'arms', 'young', 'man', 'school', 'Ryan', 'Ashley', 'Springer', '.Things', 'go', 'fine', 'two', 'consoling', 'ear', 'listen', 'romantic', 'evening', 'results', 'first', 'real', 'experience', 'where', 'nothing', 'when', 'was', 'win', 'bet', 'CHOMP.How', 'Dawn', 'finally', 'everything', 'mother', 'step-brother', 'own', 'awakening', 'sexuality', 'funny', 'film', 'metaphors', 'teenage', 'years', 'dealing', 'puberty', 'run', 'rampant', 'Granted', 'not', 'everyone', 'fans', 'films', 'Troma', 'off', 'kilter', 'warped', 'comedies', 'strange', 'movies', 'more', 'will', 'want', 'seek', 'one', 'out.It', 'fit', 'category', 'company', 'putting', 'out', 'Dimension', 'Extreme', 'most', 'definitely', 'not', 'children', 'approach', 'open', 'mind', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', 'truly', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'Not', 'easily', 'offended', 'squeamish', 'something', 'different', 'what', 'seek', 'DVD', 'then', 'one', 'right', 'alley']",N/A

I don't mean different in the sense of being a young woman of strict religious principals struggling to find love and acceptance in high school. No, Dawn is different because she has lamprey teeth. In her lady parts. Yes, you read that right. Dawn has a condition known as ""vagina dentata"" which is Latin for ""Jaws p***y."" (I had to censor myself...this is a family website.) You can guess where the film goes from there.Where do I even begin with this one? I'm going to get this out of the way right up front...I am not a huge fan of comedy in my horror movies, even black comedy. The line between inspired filmmaking and ridiculous bore for horror comedy is razor thin in my opinion. It fails more often than it succeeds, which is unfortunately the case with ""Teeth."" The jokes, when they come, are not really that funny because of all the screaming and blood. Imagine a movie where every joke is the date rape joke from ""Observe and Report."" Yeah, sounds hilarious right?At this point, you are saying ""Matt, so it isn't that funny but isn't it scary? I mean, emasculating female revenge is TOTALLY SCARY."" Well, chief, you're wrong there too. The biggest disappointment is that the scares are pretty dull. You know when they are coming (since anything that goes into the vagina of doom meets the same end), they are pretty much the same every time (because how many different ways can you put something into the vagina of doom without it becoming a horror comedy PORNO?), and they usually have some of the ""comedy"" tossed in there that makes the whole exercise just fail epically.To top it all off, I just couldn't get behind any of the characters. Dawn is annoying and everybody she comes into contact with is a doucher. Which begs the question...how does one person run into this many rapists/molesters/douchebags in a period of a FEW DAYS in a SMALL TOWN and manages to get all kinds of stuff shoved up there to be bitten off?! I understand that if the entire conceit of your movie is to have a vajayjay with a blender in it, you need to find a reason for stuff to go up there. But the filmmakers don't want Dawn to be a monster, they want her to be sympathetic. It just left me blas&eacute;. Of course, I guess it is a moot point anyway since how many people have teeth in their vagina?This film received positive critical response and was a hit at Sundance in 2007. I mean, I understand ""the message."" I understand the point that it makes about female empowerment and the metaphor for sexuality and yada yada yada. I guess ""Teeth"" should be given its due for that if nothing else. But purely as a piece of entertainment, it just isn't satisfying.",2,"""Teeth"" needs to go to the orthodontist to get straightened out.",1315353600,"09 7, 2011",2011,2881,"['So', 'watched', 'charming', 'little', 'movie', 'called', 'Teeth', 'other', 'day', 'tale', 'virginal', 'promise', 'ring', 'wearing', 'inspirational', 'chastity', 'speech', 'giving', 'teen', 'name', 'Dawn', 'Jess', 'Weixler', 'Dawn', 'little', 'different', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'different', 'sense', 'being', 'young', 'woman', 'strict', 'religious', 'principals', 'struggling', 'find', 'love', 'acceptance', 'high', 'school', 'No', 'Dawn', 'different', 'lamprey', 'teeth', 'lady', 'parts', 'Yes', 'read', 'right', 'Dawn', 'condition', 'known', 'vagina', 'dentata', 'Latin', 'Jaws', 'p***y', 'had', 'censor', 'family', 'website', 'can', 'guess', 'where', 'film', 'there.Where', 'do', 'even', 'begin', 'one', ""'m"", 'going', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'comedy', 'horror', 'movies', 'even', 'black', 'comedy', 'line', 'inspired', 'filmmaking', 'ridiculous', 'bore', 'horror', 'comedy', 'razor', 'thin', 'opinion', 'more', 'often', 'unfortunately', 'case', 'Teeth', 'jokes', 'when', 'come', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'funny', 'screaming', 'blood', 'Imagine', 'movie', 'where', 'joke', 'date', 'rape', 'joke', 'Observe', 'Report', 'Yeah', 'hilarious', 'right', 'point', 'are', 'saying', 'Matt', ""n't"", 'funny', ""n't"", 'scary', 'mean', 'emasculating', 'female', 'revenge', 'TOTALLY', 'SCARY', 'Well', 'chief', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'there', 'too', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'scares', 'are', 'pretty', 'dull', 'know', 'when', 'are', 'coming', 'anything', 'vagina', 'doom', 'same', 'end', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'time', 'how', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'can', 'put', 'something', 'vagina', 'doom', 'becoming', 'horror', 'comedy', 'PORNO', 'usually', 'have', 'comedy', 'tossed', 'whole', 'exercise', 'just', 'fail', 'epically.To', 'top', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'characters', 'Dawn', 'annoying', 'everybody', 'contact', 'doucher', 'question', 'how', 'one', 'person', 'run', 'many', 'rapists/molesters/douchebags', 'period', 'FEW', 'DAYS', 'SMALL', 'TOWN', 'manages', 'get', 'kinds', 'stuff', 'shoved', 'up', 'there', 'be', 'bitten', 'off', 'understand', 'entire', 'conceit', 'movie', 'have', 'vajayjay', 'blender', 'need', 'find', 'reason', 'stuff', 'go', 'up', 'there', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'Dawn', 'be', 'monster', 'want', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'just', 'left', 'blas', 'eacute', 'course', 'guess', 'moot', 'point', 'anyway', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'teeth', 'vagina', 'film', 'received', 'positive', 'critical', 'response', 'was', 'hit', 'Sundance', '2007', 'mean', 'understand', 'message', 'understand', 'point', 'female', 'empowerment', 'metaphor', 'sexuality', 'yada', 'yada', 'yada', 'guess', 'Teeth', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'due', 'nothing', 'else', 'purely', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'just', ""n't"", 'satisfying']",N/A

1140663,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B0013D8L7M,Micheal Hunt,"[2, 3]","When a friend recommended this and explained the plot, I couldn't wait to see this and had higher hopes then it turned out to be. You would think you could not go wrong about making a movie about a girl who has a vagina with teeth, and, as you would guess, if a penis enters it... well, NOM, NOM, NOM.But the thing about the movie was it was not as awesome as it could be. The plot evolves around a character named Dawn (Jess Weixler) who was born with teeth inside of her vagina. She is first introduced at around the age of 2 sitting with her soon to be brother in-law who is only a year or two older then her, as well as her mother and her soon to be step father. The brother tries to finger her and his finger gets bitten. I suppose the fact that a nuclear power plant is just about in their backyard may be what explains why this phenomenon occurs. Cut to a few years later, Dawn is around 17 years old or so, and a purity freak, preaching to students about staying pure until married etc... it's rather an annoying first half hour, as she plays a geeky, almost born again christian-type of character that I just saw as being a lame character with no believability to the role.Soon she meets up with a guy, and they fancy each other, go out on lame dates and made me cringe when you are supposed to beleive these kids would actually choose to go see a movie rated G because the R rated one would have sex scenes, and the PG one would probably have make out scenes... to which while in the G rated one, the friends make out anyway... who wrote this lame stuff?After a while it gets a little better as Dawn wants to get closer to her new friend, and they go to a make out spot where a lake and some caves are. While int he caves Dawn's new friend isn't the super nice guy he seems to be, and forces himself onto her. You can guess what is about to happen... and it does. After this event Dawn is self-conscious that her vagina may not be normal. She wants to turn herself in for what happened to her friend, but things don't quite turn out that way as her and her vertical smile get into more trouble.The way the effects where done was not too bad, but I think their just needed to be a lot more. Their is very little visual, and i'm not saying it should have been a full blow out, show everything sort of thing, but a shot of the teeth inside her would have made it something more interesting. It seems like too much is focused on other things rather then what a viewer of this sort of movie would rather see. I think probably because I expected a comedy, or a slap-stick horror movie, like Troma would make, would be the ideal fit for this kind of movie... but this one here, it almost took itself too seriously... yet, not serious enough to go with a ""it's a real legend phenomenon"" thing, that you might beleive this sort of mutation could occur, nor did it have the comedy to make it a more enjoyable movie. It just sits on the borderline not knowing which direction it should take.Overall, I got to the end of the film without feeling like I should turn it off, but then again, once it was over, I thought it could be a hell of alot better, and Lloyd Kaufman would have done a much better job of bringing this story to life. It's a movie that sounds alot cooler then it actually is, with a few too many lame moments and un-needed extra bits... then a sick little twist to the end that didn't have the shock value it needed to make it anything more then, ""well, ok then, on your bike then""",2,2 and a half chomping stars,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,3497,"['When', 'friend', 'recommended', 'explained', 'plot', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'had', 'higher', 'hopes', 'then', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'would', 'think', 'could', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'making', 'movie', 'girl', 'who', 'vagina', 'teeth', 'would', 'guess', 'penis', 'well', 'NOM', 'NOM', 'NOM.But', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'awesome', 'could', 'be', 'plot', 'around', 'character', 'named', 'Dawn', 'Jess', 'Weixler', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'teeth', 'inside', 'vagina', 'first', 'introduced', 'age', '2', 'sitting', 'soon', 'be', 'brother', 'in-law', 'who', 'only', 'year', 'two', 'older', 'then', 'as', 'well', 'mother', 'soon', 'be', 'step', 'father', 'brother', 'finger', 'finger', 'bitten', 'suppose', 'fact', 'nuclear', 'power', 'plant', 'just', 'about', 'backyard', 'may', 'be', 'what', 'why', 'phenomenon', 'Cut', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Dawn', '17', 'years', 'old', 'so', 'purity', 'freak', 'preaching', 'students', 'staying', 'pure', 'married', 'etc', 'rather', 'annoying', 'first', 'hour', 'geeky', 'almost', 'born', 'again', 'christian-type', 'character', 'just', 'saw', 'being', 'lame', 'character', 'believability', 'role.Soon', 'up', 'guy', 'fancy', 'other', 'go', 'out', 'lame', 'dates', 'made', 'cringe', 'when', 'are', 'supposed', 'beleive', 'kids', 'would', 'actually', 'choose', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'rated', 'G', 'R', 'rated', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'sex', 'scenes', 'PG', 'one', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'make', 'out', 'scenes', 'G', 'rated', 'one', 'friends', 'make', 'out', 'anyway', 'who', 'wrote', 'lame', 'stuff', 'while', 'little', 'better', 'Dawn', 'get', 'closer', 'new', 'friend', 'go', 'make', 'out', 'spot', 'where', 'lake', 'caves', 'are', 'int', 'Dawn', 'new', 'friend', ""n't"", 'super', 'nice', 'guy', 'be', 'forces', 'can', 'guess', 'what', 'about', 'happen', 'event', 'Dawn', 'self-conscious', 'vagina', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'normal', 'turn', 'what', 'happened', 'friend', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'turn', 'out', 'way', 'vertical', 'smile', 'get', 'more', 'trouble.The', 'way', 'effects', 'where', 'done', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'think', 'just', 'needed', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'very', 'little', 'visual', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'full', 'blow', 'show', 'everything', 'sort', 'thing', 'shot', 'teeth', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'something', 'more', 'interesting', 'too', 'much', 'focused', 'other', 'things', 'rather', 'then', 'what', 'viewer', 'sort', 'movie', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'think', 'probably', 'expected', 'comedy', 'slap-stick', 'horror', 'movie', 'Troma', 'would', 'make', 'would', 'be', 'ideal', 'fit', 'kind', 'movie', 'one', 'here', 'almost', 'took', 'too', 'seriously', 'yet', 'not', 'serious', 'enough', 'go', 'real', 'legend', 'phenomenon', 'thing', 'might', 'beleive', 'sort', 'mutation', 'could', 'occur', 'did', 'have', 'comedy', 'make', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'just', 'borderline', 'not', 'knowing', 'direction', 'should', 'take.Overall', 'got', 'end', 'film', 'feeling', 'should', 'turn', 'off', 'then', 'again', 'was', 'thought', 'could', 'be', 'hell', 'alot', 'better', 'Lloyd', 'Kaufman', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'bringing', 'story', 'life', 'movie', 'alot', 'cooler', 'then', 'actually', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'lame', 'moments', 'un-needed', 'extra', 'bits', 'then', 'sick', 'little', 'twist', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'shock', 'value', 'needed', 'make', 'anything', 'more', 'then', 'well', 'then', 'bike', 'then']",N/A

Jess Weixler stars as Dawn, an abstinance preaching high school student who gets a huge surprise when she discovers she has quite the physical advantage when she becomes the object of male sexual violence.  You can figure out what this advantage is just from reading the film's synopsis, which is basically the ultimate form of female empowerment.  Had the genders been reversed in some way, Teeth would be pure exploitation all the way, but instead, Teeth is an often gripping (and somewhat cheesey), and nearly unforgettable, tale of revenge.  The only real flaws with Teeth is that a majority of the situations Dawn finds herself in, namely getting forced against her will, come off as unrealistic.  However, the film is really an amalgamation of female empowerment, exploitation, cautionary tale, and plain horror; yet it never feels like it, or feel generic for that matter either.  Weixler is quite good in the leading role, as is Nip/Tuck's John Hensley as Dawn's sadistic half brother who you just know is going to get what he deserves.

1140683,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0013D8L7M,RMurray847,"[1, 1]","A while back, Megan Fox & Amanda Seyfried starred in JENNIFER'S BODY, a ""horror"" film that wanted to be funny and observant at the same time.  What it ended up being was a mess.  The ""horror"" wasn't even remotely horrifying and humor only worked if your idea of wit involves Fox making double entendres.  It was a failure and a flop.The other day, I watched 2007's TEETH, a film that combines genuine creepiness & dread with some sharp if a bit obvious social observation and humor.  It was a modestly budgeted film with a very iffy cast, but probably what kept it from hitting theaters was its subject matter.  It deals with a high school girl named Dawn (Jess Weixler), who discovers that she is afflicted with vagina dentata.  In other words, having sex with Dawn will leave guys literally emasculated and bleeding to death.  (If you happened to see Ellen Page's brilliant HARD CANDY and that made you squeamish...your reaction to the events in TEETH may be stronger.)Dawn has spent her life up to her senior year of high school as a religious, even prudish young lady.  She has not only taken a vow of chastity till marriage, but she is the district's most outspoken chastity spokesperson.  While Dawn does not know she is constructed in a dangerous manner, it would seem the sub-consciously, at least, she has a clue that she might be a bit dangerous to the opposite sex.She lives with her mother, stepfather and stepbrother Brad (John Hensley from NIP TUCK).  Brad is a complete jerk.  He pretty much stays in this bedroom all the time, blasts heavy metal music all the time and roughs up his girlfriend.  He also hates his step-sister...because he's been in love with her since they were small children.Dawn discovers her anatomic difference one day when she finally succumbs to temptation (sort of) with Tobey, a handsome guy who has also taken the vow.  The two are drawn to each other and engage in some serious necking, but when Tobey is overcome by lust, despite Dawn's protests...he pays a pretty direct and nasty price.After this, a few other guys also receive nasty surprises, as Dawn tries to come to terms with her ""gift.""The movie treats its male characters almost universally cruelly.  They are all guys who are ruled by their lurid desires...all worthy of meeting their bloody fates.  It got a bit tiring.  The movie is also commenting, in one way or another, on the chastity movement.  The commentaries are clumsy and obvious, but at least the film has a sly sense of humor.  Nothing is laugh-out-loud funny, really...but certainly the tastelessness makes you squirm and laugh at the same time.In the midst of it all, young Weixler gives a 100% committed and convincing performance.  It's not Oscar caliber...but it IS all one could hope for in this part.  When she is supposed to be pure and innocent, Weixler nails this with hardly a wink.  She's utterly sincere, and thus we can believe that heretofore, she has never discovered her special problem.  When she protests Tobey's advances, we can really sense her conflicted emotions...the battle between her head and heart.  And as she begins to figure out just what is going on, she undergoes a number of emotional changes that Weixler always handles well.  I'd like to see her take a lead in a less off-beat and off-putting film.On the other hand, Hensley continues to repulse me.  As Matt on NIP TUCK, he was the most horrible and unlikeable character because the actor himself is so physically unappealing AND a terrible actor.  He had a small role in the mediocre horror film SHUTTER and was equally dreadful in that.  In TEETH, we are certainly ready to cheer for any misfortune that may befall him...mostly because I'd like to see John Hensley disappear from the screen forever.Other roles are handled passably.  Overall, the film is passable.  The pace is slower than it should be.  The adults in the film behave with little logic.  The script isn't as clever as it thinks it is.  But it IS the best film about vagina dentata you've seen, and Jess Weixler is worth seeing.In summation, I'd say that if the plot I describe above just puts you off entirely, then don't watch the film just to enjoy one good performance.  If, on the other hand, you find it luridly intriguing (as I did)...you might actually be surprised that it isn't as dreadful as you'd have the right to expect.

1140684,A1QRY1XLMKX1KU,B0013D8L7M,Robert Rootes,"[1, 3]","OK, now the idea of dentata for me (a male) was of curiosity. Of course, like the cat that followed curiosity, I believe this movie provoked fear. I loved this film. I found the morbid curiosity that brought me to view the film, also pulled from me the feelings of the unknown toward women. I thought the piece was empowering for women, and the lead actor Jess Weixler is someone to watch for upcoming films. I wonder how someone could put this film in his or her resume, but I?m not an actor, just an author. If the idea of (Can't say here) dentata frightens you, don't watch this film. I though the violence was subtle in much the way things was implied without being shown. All the same, I still cringed with every sound effect.

1140686,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0013D8L7M,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","Michael Lichtenstein`s ""Teeth"" is a pitch-dark feminist satire guaranteed to have the men in the audience squirming in their seats and crossing their legs in self-defense - while the women squeal in ""you-go-girl!"" solidarity with the heroine.  With an envelope-pushing tone reminiscent of the early works of John Waters, ""Teeth"" pulls out all the Freudian stops in its story of an attractive young abstinence-only advocate named Dawn (Jess Weixler) who, as the result of a mutation in her DNA, has developed a set of razor-sharp teeth in her private area - a condition known in ancient mythology as ""Vagina Dentata.""  At first she is freaked out by the discovery, until she learns that she can turn this bizarre anatomical anomaly into a weapon against any man who fails to respect her for the lady she is.With ironic detachment and outlandish humor, ""Teeth"" acknowledges that, in the depths of our collective subconscious, we have been conditioned to link sexual behavior with danger, mutilation and even death.  Further, we have been taught  to view women as somehow posing a threat to men's continued virility and survival.  From the black widow spider to the archetypal figures like Pandora, Eve, the sirens and Medusa who inhabit our literature, females are frequently portrayed as irresistible creatures luring unsuspecting men to their doom (the death can be either literal or metaphoric).  ""Teeth,"" in all its shocking outrageousness, simply finds the most graphic way imaginable of illustrating that theme.The movie takes place in one of those stifling suburban settings where vice, corruption and perversion always seem to be simmering just beneath the surface of tree-lined streets and perfectly manicured lawns - only in this film, the real threat is hidden not in the environment but within the human body itself (unless one counts the industrial smokestacks we see lurking in the background, pumping out a constant cloud of toxic chemicals, enough to give anyone`s DNA a mutation or two).Dawn could have been portrayed from the start as a calculating shrew intent on emasculating every man in sight out of her own twisted sense of divine righteousness.  Instead, Lichtenstein and Weixler bring a perplexed poignancy to the character, starting her off as a confused kid coming to terms with just what this will mean for her as she makes her way through life.  It isn't until she flashes a final subversive smile at the camera as she heads on to her newest deserving victim that we sense that her transformation into a globe-trotting warrior for her gender is finally complete.""Teeth"" is definitely for those with an appreciation for the freaky and far-out.

1140688,A3BAOIC7JMCY6R,B0013D8L7M,"RPK ""Professional Shark Tamer""","[4, 11]","Teeth is one of those indie films that (In my opinion) is WAY overhyped. I saw the film's trailer before a movie I rented a little while ago and thought it looked really disturbing and scary.The previews are very misleading.While the film is enthralling and captivating (Who WOULDN'T be interested in a girl with Razor sharp-shark-like teeth in her nay-nay!?)It really let me down in the long run.I couldn't get a grasp on WHAT the film makers were going for when they made this movie. It doesn't come across as scary and the satirical humor just seemed oddly delivered.The gore isn't as bad as people are making it out to be. So what, you see a bloody prosthetic penis stump on the ground-it looked like a vibrator with ketchup on it- NOT gory to me!The main character Dawn reminded me of Winona Ryder in Edward Scissorhands. Something about her blonde hair and tiny angelic features just kept bringing me back to that Tim Burton Classic. Dawn is an interesting character to watch though. She's pretty, likeable and has a strong moral foundation with an emphasis on Abstinance. Her sweet charm and naivity seem to play against her and the films male antagonists.Because of her looks and firm abstinance stance, Dawn finds herself a magnet for the lowliest of boys. Her appeal introduces us to a slew of villians who truly get what was coming to them-Can you guess what happens to her Abstinant Friend who she goes swimming with alone??? WE COULD USE IT AS BAIT!! What about her creepy gynocologist who gets a little too touchy feely (reminded me of the first scene in The Hand That Rocks The Cradle) during Dawn's first physical exam?? OUCH!! What about the slimey kid who bets his friends he can de-virginize the Teen Purity-Queen? BOO-YOW!And After chomping off a couple weiners and some phalanges, Dawn realizes she can use her special dentata down yonder to enact some vengeance upon her wicked stepbrother (Played by that kid from Nip Tuck who looks like Michael Jackson)...The end result is a special NIP TUCK a-la Dawn Dentata!Honestly, I just couldn't get into this film. It was too satirical and whitty to be scary and too disgusting to be funny. I felt like the film should have either taken itself seriously or gone ALL THE WAY to the humor side of it and been a full-fledged comedy.The feminist undertones are there, which is something I appreciate in a horror film. The male characters (With the exception of Dawn's Stepfather) are all pigs and you want them all to get there danglers bitten off. I HONESTLY liked the empowerment that Dawn gets from her ability in the end.Teeth COULD very well serve as a cautionary tale to young boys wanting to sleep with there girlfriends. Maybe the movie's creators had a bigger, long term goal in mind with Teeth and are hoping that young boys watch it and fear the possible dentata lurking inside there girlfriends.Maybe it's a great form of birth control for young kids to see this?Maybe it will save some youth the torture of contracting an STD?Maybe it will scare guys away from physically forcing themselves onto a girl?Who knows!The possibilities are endless for young, open minds eager and willing to manipulate and scare! But, for myself, a 26 year old adult, The movie flopped and felt like one long-drawn out student film with no punch line.The saving grace of Teeth would be Jess Weixler's (Dawn) performance. She is on my IT list for up and coming stars of the future. She gives off a natural likeability and quality that draws you in. She really played Dawn well. I enjoyed her in this film and can't wait to see more of her.Overall, I didn't like the movie. Sorry die hard TEETH lovers. It didn't scare me, it didn't make me laugh and it didn't really disturb me. I guess some people love it, but I didnt!I recommend it to middle school Health teachers to play during Sex Ed.",2,"""Vagina Dentata!

1140692,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B0013D8L7M,Sid the Elf,"[16, 23]","Usually during a horror flick the ladies are the ones to squirm but it is quite the contrary in our title feature ""Teeth."" This film is probably the most unique we've seen in ages. It explores the ancient myth of vagina dentata that was found in several ancient cultures. The way this myth goes is that certain woman have teeth in the vagina which will bite off the manhood of all suitors until a hero comes to conquer the inner beast, turning her into a normal woman. Yeah if your a guy this is by far the scariest horror concept ever created. We'd rather take on Michael Myers and any killer/creature out there instead of going to battle with vagina dentata. The film takes a modern day twist on the myth making it a very entertaining yet horrific experience.The film starts off with a couple of young kids sitting in a swimming pool. Their parents will soon be married and they will become brother and sister despite the young boys crap attitude towards it. This kid is a total perv and shows the little girl captain winky which then is followed by him screaming. The parents come running out to find the young boys finger deeply sliced up and bleeding. Now we jump to the teenage years and the girl (Dawn) is the leader of a local chastity group. She speaks to kids telling them the importance of saving themselves for marriage. The step brother (Brad) on the other hand is even worse of a perv and now a total drug machine whose sole purpose in life is to nail Dawn, who is his stepsister. Yeah we're thinking this one took place in the midwest. As Dawn leads her group she winds up meeting a Hale Appleman who shares her same views of self preservation. They wind up hitting it off and decide to take a swim down at a local lake. As their swiming they start making out which sends Hale's harmones through the roof. This kid seems so backed up that he's about to explode at any minute, which he soon tries to. He winds up making a move on Dawn and gets shut down. After being shut down he decides it time for some raping and forces himself in her. Now ideally we were hoping Chris Hansen would come out of the cave and read him his computer transcript and then send him on his way to be tackled by a group of cops but instead we have something much worse. Hale enrages the beast within Dawn and gets his manhood chomped off in one of the most disturbing scenes ever.Now Dawn is so freaked out that she does some research online finding out about the Dentata myth. She isn't sure if thats what she has and decides to go to the gyno for a check up. Sure enough she finds out she does have it once her vagin bites off four of the doctors fingers. Now the poor girl is really screwed up. She has been restraining herself from sex for years and now she founds out anything that goes near her gets ripped to shreds. She had to wonder if she was going to wind up like the 40 year old virgin. She doesn't know who to turn to and decided the only person she can trust is some d bag she knows from school. Once she's over his house he gets her loaded and gets it on with her vowing he will conquer the beast, and does. He gets through the sexy time and keeps his goods in tact. As they go for it again he answers the phone telling his friend he nailed her as part of the bet. Yeah he went for her as part of a bet seeing if he could uncork her. She gets furious and has unleashes the dentata on him taking half his genitals.

The basic premise (no spoiler here, you find this out right away) is that Dawn is a girl with a mutation, likely spawned because of a nuclear power plant in their picturesque little town. It's a complex movie with quite a few things going on. You'll probably find yourself asking a few questions by the end, like when is it justified to mutilate a man's penis? After you answer that question ask yourself when it is ok to rape a woman. It's not. (In my eyes, and this is just my opinion, I see cutting off a man's penis as equal to rape. In some ways I think you could argue it is more severe than rape, although it's hard to really compare two things that are so evil)I have a serious phobia (as do most men I'm sure) of having my penis cut off, so from that aspect it was a scary film. Otherwise it was unremarkable though, and honestly I couldn't even find it scary since I'm not one to sleep around a lot, force myself on women, or do generally douchey things. Let's just say I couldn't really relate to the guys in this film.The biggest problem I had with this film was, ironically, the shots of the nuclear power plant. I never looked close, but I'm sure it's CGI, it's in the middle of the town and it doesn't seem like many small towns would need a nuclear power plant. The problem I had was that it was established as a key feature in the environment, and it was somewhat implied that radiation (from the shots of the plant) played some part in Dawn's mutation. There, in this picturesque town are these two huge cooling towers, the staples of nuclear energy. Out of the top spews a vile black vapor, staining the towers themselves. THIS was the problem I had. Call me anal, but how can you get this detail wrong? Those towers don't smoke, they release water vapor. They are cooling towers, the water takes the heat from the cores, turns to vapor, pressurizes and flows through a turbine producing electricity, and is then released. (depending a little bit on the kind of plant, of course) There is nothing dangerous in that vapor, unless there is a huge malfunction in the facility itself, and people would know VERY soon if there was that type of problem, it wouldn't go on for years. That took me out of the movie every single time I saw it.Overall the movie was interesting, but not something I'm going to watch again, simply because it was just boring.",3,Slow Moving,1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,2498,"['was', 'certainly', 'different', 'experience', 'well-done', 'movie', 'fairly', 'slow', 'moving', 'kind', 'boring', 'actually', 'basic', 'premise', 'spoiler', 'here', 'find', 'out', 'right', 'away', 'Dawn', 'girl', 'mutation', 'likely', 'spawned', 'nuclear', 'power', 'plant', 'picturesque', 'little', 'town', 'complex', 'movie', 'few', 'things', 'going', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'asking', 'few', 'questions', 'end', 'when', 'justified', 'mutilate', 'man', 'penis', 'answer', 'question', 'ask', 'when', 'ok', 'rape', 'woman', 'not', 'eyes', 'just', 'opinion', 'see', 'cutting', 'off', 'man', 'penis', 'equal', 'rape', 'ways', 'think', 'could', 'argue', 'more', 'severe', 'rape', 'hard', 'really', 'compare', 'two', 'things', 'are', 'so', 'evil', 'have', 'serious', 'phobia', 'do', 'most', 'men', ""'m"", 'sure', 'having', 'penis', 'cut', 'off', 'so', 'aspect', 'was', 'scary', 'film', 'Otherwise', 'was', 'unremarkable', 'honestly', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'find', 'scary', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'sleep', 'around', 'lot', 'force', 'women', 'do', 'generally', 'douchey', 'things', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'relate', 'guys', 'film.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'ironically', 'shots', 'nuclear', 'power', 'plant', 'never', 'looked', 'close', ""'m"", 'sure', 'CGI', 'middle', 'town', ""n't"", 'seem', 'many', 'small', 'towns', 'would', 'need', 'nuclear', 'power', 'plant', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'was', 'established', 'key', 'feature', 'environment', 'was', 'somewhat', 'implied', 'radiation', 'shots', 'plant', 'played', 'part', 'Dawn', 'mutation', 'picturesque', 'town', 'are', 'two', 'huge', 'cooling', 'towers', 'staples', 'nuclear', 'energy', 'top', 'vile', 'black', 'vapor', 'staining', 'towers', 'THIS', 'was', 'problem', 'had', 'Call', 'anal', 'how', 'can', 'get', 'detail', 'wrong', 'towers', 'do', ""n't"", 'smoke', 'release', 'water', 'vapor', 'are', 'cooling', 'towers', 'water', 'heat', 'cores', 'vapor', 'pressurizes', 'turbine', 'producing', 'electricity', 'then', 'released', 'depending', 'little', 'bit', 'kind', 'plant', 'course', 'nothing', 'dangerous', 'vapor', 'huge', 'malfunction', 'facility', 'people', 'would', 'know', 'VERY', 'soon', 'was', 'type', 'problem', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'years', 'took', 'movie', 'single', 'time', 'saw', 'it.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'interesting', 'not', 'something', ""'m"", 'going', 'watch', 'again', 'simply', 'was', 'just', 'boring']",N/A

I remember seeing the trailers for this, which left me with my mouth hanging wide open in disbelief. I could not BELIEVE that they had made such a film as this, yet I was strangely curious. It didn't play around South Carolina, and so I missed the theatrical run. Thank God for DVD's. I finally rented it the other day and watched it. It has to be one of the most over the top, extreme films that I have ever seen since FREEWAY.It's basically about this virginal teenager who is very militant and gung-ho about staying celebate until her wedding day. However, she ultimately becomes betrayed by her first crush, and he attempts to rape her. Well, he succeeds, until something inside of her vagina rips off his dingaling, leaving a bloody stump -- and rendering the audience speechless in the process, that is, if you are completely successful in containing your laughter. As sick as it sounds, it really is quite hilarious. So anyways, our heroine finds a use for her newfound set of choppers. She strikes back at the men who try to take advantage of her in any way, by doing away with their penises...and/or fingers.It's pretty crazy. This is a film that I can only recommend to the brave, or to those who would ""get"" it's humor without being totally offended.

Without making a point about the glorification or reivindication of the female control in sexual intercourse, or even the command that we girls exert in couple relationships, my guess is that men will enjoy this film way more than us girls. The popular myth of the ""Vagina Dentata"" wich exists from centuries in many archaic old cultures, is frankly quite intimidating: The very thought of the concept  ashames, terrifies and humiliates women, imagining such a terrible deformity and cruel fate erases any idea of normality in a social behaviour. There could be no peace of mind, at all: The relationships with the opposite sex will be marked by fear of embarrassement, by being pointed or cataloged as a freak.But for you guys, that's a completely different story, far more gruesome and petrifying. The excruciating  pain of castration haunts the minds of men like a relentless collective nightmare, like a part of an ancient fear incrustated in male culture since the beginning of the genre. The menace of genital damage even in the smallest degree, turns a man into a  frightful helpless child. The paralysing physical pain implied in the pressence of inminent castration is the nucleum, the essence of terror in this particular portrayal of  psychological torture and almost surreal imaginable agony. Therefore, the suspense of the definitive scenes must be a torment for men, while they grab their parts and nod their heads in despair.With no deflection  in the theme of teenage sexual awakening, this movie shows the struggle of a young beautiful girl to supress her emerging sexuality after making a starling discovery about her womanhood. As a funny paradox, Dawn (Jess Weixler) is a proud virgin with strong religious principles, the most active member of her local chastity group, and her noble efforts to remain chaste are challenged by her disturbed stepbrother Brad, as well as other advances in school. With that increasing difficulty in her shoulders, Dawn discovers after a sexual assault that her vagina actually has teeth. The comprehension of the benefits and drawbacks of her anatomical anomaly drives her into a series of encounters that will stop the heart of most men in the audience. Her strange new revelation leads us into the dark and irreverent side of sexuality, combined with a satirical, disturbing and ""biting"" vision of  lost innocence.Lurid and visceral as it is, this movie didn't completely acomplished to explore the true potential of the great original theme, delivering a work that goes from teenage drama, to horror, to comedy and back again. The substance of the film is uneven in matters of style, unbalanced in rhythm and action, but former actor Mitchell Litchtenstein makes a quite valuable effort in his first directed movie. This could be the beginning of an interesting new career, no doubt.",4,WAIT: To the Gynecologist...AND the dentist?

1140704,A373R1CJT7JEKT,B0013D8L7M,titania86,"[5, 7]","Dawn O'Keefe is an abstinent Christian that advocates for everyone to wait until marriage, avoid masturbation, and only have sex for procreation. She speaks at the local chastity groups meetings and does everything she can to keep away from temptation: only hanging out with chastity group members, dating in groups, only watching G rated films, and, of course, wearing her purity ring. Her pretty veneer hides the fact that she has a sick mother at home, a passive and weak father, and a violent creepy stepbrother at home. Everything is going pretty well (as far as abstinence goes) until she starts dating Tobey, a fellow chastity group member. Their resolve dissolves as they meet at a secluded lake known for being popular with couples. Dawn comes to her senses and refuses Tobey's sexual advances, but he doesn't take no for an answer. She tries to fight him off and in the process discovers an attribute of her body she never knew she had. Is she a mutant freak or can she use this newfound ability to her advantage?Teeth seems to be a typical cheesy teen gorefest on the surface. Well, it is, but there is a lot of things happening below the surface that the average audience member may not get on the first viewing as a result. The general tone of the film is light and comical, but there are a couple of serious scenes as well. The penis and finger severing scenes are usually pretty funny and, as expected, accompanied with lots of blood and screaming. This film doesn't take itself completely seriously, but it does say a lot about our society and the way women are viewed.At first, Dawn seems to be a shell of a person. She's a Christian, but she doesn't seem to be very devout beyond abstinence. She doesn't go to church or help the homeless or get involved in any other church activities. Her interests aren't really known either. It seems her only desire is to get married and have children. In our society and in the view of the popular Christian religions, she is the perfect poster girl. People are still shocked when I tell them I have no interest in having children as if it's my obligation to do so just because I happen to have a vagina. It's simply ridiculous. Anyway, even though they are both actively abstinent, Dawn and Tobey meet in a secluded lake known as a sex/makeout spot. This scene is a commentary for all those people who are resistant to having proper sex education in schools. In abstinence only classes, the same amount of kids have sex, but more of them now have diseases they were never educated about or become pregnant.Dawn progresses from a one dimensional, perfect, almost robotic girl to a real one with emotions, confusion, and a will to discover herself. When her teeth make themselves known, she is afraid and has no idea what's happening. Her fear stems from her ignorance of her own body. In an earlier scene, she saw a horrible vision of a toothed insect when she attempted to masturbate. She sees her own sexuality as monstrous and disgusting and she fears it. In sex education at her school, there was a big sticker over the diagram of the vulva. Society doesn't want feminine sexuality depicted in an earnest and real way. This diagram isn't shown, but throughout the film there are advertisements with scantily clad women with only their bodies on display all over the place. It seems as if the only way a women can be seen as sexual is as a sex object. The scene where Dawn removes the sticker and stares in shock and wonder is beautiful because she sees that her body and her sexuality isn't something to fear. Her vagina dentata then becomes a weapon she can wield to protect herself. Jess Weixler does a beautiful job portraying Dawn and her emotional journey.Brad is the opposite of Dawn. He is her creepy stepbrother who has lusted after her since their parents married when they were children. Warped and disturbed, he views women only as sex objects and subhuman, seen with the pornographic photos on his walls, the abusive relationship with his girlfriend, the disregard he has for his ailing mother, and the fact that he named his dog Mother. There really aren't any consequences to his actions because of the inaction of his parents and society in general, which enables him to keep being a misogynist douche. There really aren't any men in this film that aren't either sexually abusive or insanely weak. Also, the only people who are mutilated by Dawn are men. I guess this could be seen as misandrist, but since horror is famous for being misogynistic, I think it's only fair for there to be a different persepective on things. I also don't think its saying all men are this way, but to prove his point the filmmaker only included horrible, reprehensible men.The film also features small things that may not be obvious to the undiscerning viewer. Like Dawn's last name is a reference to a feminist painter, Georgia O'Keeffe. Medusa is depicted in the film more than once, which is a reference to the Greek myth version of vagina dentata. This trope is seen in ancient mythology all over the world, stemming from man's fear of castration and female sexuality. This tale reverses this myth and makes it one of female empowerment.The bottom line with this film is that it's unique, cerebral, and aware of its long history. Teeth is a mixture of good, bloody fun and social commentary. I would recommend this to just about everyone, but those who might be offended by severed members and toothed vaginas should avoid this.",5,A refreshing and fun feminist horror film,1297382400,"02 11,

Early in the film, she meets a young man in the Promise Club who fires up her dormant libido and gets her thinking some impure thoughts. What ensues gets ugly when the two end up at a lake. In this scene, the young man's libido takes over and the real reason for Dawn's abstinence becomes apparent; she has a set of shark-like teeth hidden in her vagina which engage any time she's being mistreated, chopping off certain male appendages.

1140714,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0013D8L7M,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[13, 19]","TEETH is a satirical horror film that explores the mythology of vagina dentata (toothed vagina in latin), the myth created by men that plays on the fears of impotency. Supposedly, a ""hero"" must arise to return to the womb, his origins to conquer and neutralize the female's power. In this modern age, the film is more a comedic cautionary tale for men to take care in their treatment of women. While I have seen a very similar Japanese film in 2006, this film is a whole different experience since its Japanese counterpart is a lot more exploitive when it comes to visual blood and gore.Synopsis partly derived from the back cover:Dawn (Jess Weixler) is a very pretty but prim high school virgin who unknowingly has a set of mutant teeth between her legs. When a supposedly like minded boyfriend forces himself upon her, Dawn's ""vagina dentata"" start chomping in her defense. Caught between her emerging sexuality and a host of oversexed young men, including her twisted half-brother, Dawn eventually gives in to her freakish powers in this morbidly funny and gutsy piece of horror-comedy...Director Michell Lichtensen knew exactly what he was going for when he made this film. The filmmakers give a somewhat critical view as to why the conservatives treat sex as something to be avoided and sinful, a theme that says that teenagers should understand their bodies, an accusing finger at the smoke stacked refineries and nuclear plants, and that the ""weaker sex"" have to be respected. ""Teeth"" is more comedy than horror with its very humorous hints as to the mutated vagina as shown with the tree trunk's base and the mouth of the cave. You don't actually see the mutated culprit but you will see a lot of bitten off penises with blood spewing out, some nudity and mild sequences of intercourse. Even a dog named ""mother"" gets to have a ""hotdog"" for a snack and the film has the most twistedly funny scene of vaginal examination.The film has a lot of potential for exploitation, but the blood and gore is very mild. The filmmakers opted to just create a culture wherein the consequences of uneducated teenagers can turn out fatal if they don't have the understanding of one's body. Lichtensen goes to the myth of ""vagina dentata"" to express this idea, it's not that Dawn cannot engage in intercourse, but she has to be relaxed and perfectly willing. ""Vagina Dentata"" may well be saying; ""you wouldn't like me when I'm angry.."" and ""No means no"". Try to violate Dawn in any way and you will lose your manhood literally. The film is pretty much a social metaphor about woman empowerment instead of going for exploitive scares. He sidesteps the plot's very erotic and exploitation potential to present a satirical horror drama that revolves more on teen problems and perverted teenagers.I'm not exactly sure just exactly how I feel about ""Teeth"". The film is very amusing to watch and it did manage to keep my interest for its entirety. I was very curious to how everything would turn out. Anyway, much of the plot is left unexplored, the police's investigation of Tobey's death has left unanswered, (it was very funny and scary that they found a shark-like tooth embedded on the severed penis) and Dawn's parents seem more like plot devices than anything else. The editing isn't really that solid and the pace is very slow-moving which makes the tension-building music absolutely unnecessary. Brad (Dawn's step brother) is severely underdeveloped and there were no hints of him being irrational aside from the hints that he likes doing it in the backdoor to avoid being nicked by a vagina. He had a very traumatic episode in a game of ""show me yours and I'll show you mine"". I think the film would be funnier and more entertaining if it added shots of the mutated culprit like its Asian counterpart.I don't know, while I truly commend the film's ambition, I think this film would be better with a hint of supernatural elements mixed in to express its social issues. ""Teeth"" isn't a bad movie at all, but the direction felt like it was being held back by something and stopped short in its execution. I couldn't really figure out if the director is strengthening or criticizing the male anxiety. Have you heard of the age-old adage that penises have a mind of their own? Nonetheless, ""Teeth"" is worth a look, I'm very curious as what other folks think of this comedy-horror.Recommended with caution, rent it first.

1140715,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0013D8L7M,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","Vagina dentata -this is the premise of Teeth, a delightful little indie flick that had me in stitches. Dawn [Jess Weixler] is a sweet young teenager who advocates celibacy to her peers. She is an average teen except for one thing - her vagina has teeth aka vagina dentata. So, any guy who aspires to deflower the virginal Dawn has quite a hazardous terrain to traverse! Dawn's first serious crush ends in 'tragedy' when the guy gets aggressive whilst out on a date and Dawn 'bites' back. Feeling repulsed by her 'abnormality', Dawn researches her condition and eventually finds that she only bites when the jerks around her try to control and manipulate her [boyfriend, stepbrother, perverted doctor].I would categorise this movie as a sort of feminist horror movie [if such a category even exists], and the story is indeed fresh though some parts of the execution seem rather over the top. Guys beware - I watched this with my husband, and he winced his way through the movie. The scenes of penile dismemberment are truly gruesome. Yet,one continues to cheer for Dawn [ well-played by Jess Weixler], hoping she will find a way to lead some sort of normal life with her unique anatomical feature - and she does, sort of:) Final verdict - wicked, campy, and entertaining.",3,Wickedly campy!,1215993600,"07 14, 2008",2008,1270,"['Vagina', 'dentata', '-this', 'premise', 'Teeth', 'delightful', 'little', 'indie', 'flick', 'had', 'stitches', 'Dawn', '[', 'Jess', 'Weixler', ']', 'sweet', 'young', 'teenager', 'who', 'celibacy', 'peers', 'average', 'teen', 'one', 'thing', 'vagina', 'teeth', 'vagina', 'dentata', 'So', 'guy', 'who', 'deflower', 'virginal', 'Dawn', 'quite', 'hazardous', 'terrain', 'traverse', 'Dawn', 'first', 'serious', 'crush', ""'tragedy"", 'when', 'guy', 'aggressive', 'whilst', 'out', 'date', 'Dawn', 'back', 'Feeling', 'repulsed', ""'abnormality"", 'Dawn', 'condition', 'eventually', 'only', 'when', 'jerks', 'try', 'control', 'manipulate', '[', 'boyfriend', 'stepbrother', 'perverted', 'doctor', ']', '.I', 'would', 'categorise', 'movie', 'sort', 'feminist', 'horror', 'movie', '[', 'category', 'even', ']', 'story', 'indeed', 'fresh', 'parts', 'execution', 'seem', 'rather', 'top', 'Guys', 'watched', 'husband', 'winced', 'way', 'movie', 'scenes', 'penile', 'dismemberment', 'are', 'truly', 'gruesome', 'one', 'cheer', 'Dawn', '[', 'well-played', 'Jess', 'Weixler', ']', 'hoping', 'will', 'find', 'way', 'lead', 'sort', 'normal', 'life', 'unique', 'anatomical', 'feature', 'sort', 'Final', 'verdict', 'wicked', 'campy', 'entertaining']",N/A
