I saw the movie on television sometime ago and loved it.  What a heart-warming film and Jean Smart was great in her portrayal of a mentally retarded (slow) mother fighting the welfare agency to keep her children when the agency thinks she isn't capable to raise them due to her condition.

A great family movie that will bring you to tears within the first 15 minutes and keep you in tears for a good 40 minutes. Jean Smart is powerful and so Oscar worthy in her performance of a developmentally challenged mother of 5 boys who finds herself having to prove to the state that she is fit to care for her children when her husband becomes too ill to support the family. This movie has become one of my top 10 best films and I could easily say one of the top 5. Its a little unknown masterpiece with guts and glory!
