The plot i not stong and there are alot of holes in this tale of a future earth that was devistated by a comet resulting in a sort of second ice age.  We don't really know how the bad guys came to power or why they want to experiment on the sewer peopl but we do know that Julie is a high class call girl by day and the avengger of the sewer people by night.  This is an above average Sci-Fi B Movie with all the elements, Mad Scientist, Bad guy in love with the heroine and the child that unleashes the maternal instinct of our hero.  There is a fair amount of nudity as is common in this kind of movie but not as much action as one would expect and just not enough Julie.  over all it is a fun watch.",4,Queen julie,1316563200,"09 21, 2011",2011,785,"['am', 'big', 'julie', 'strain', 'fan', 'are', 'then', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'plot', 'i', 'not', 'stong', 'are', 'alot', 'holes', 'tale', 'future', 'earth', 'was', 'devistated', 'comet', 'resulting', 'sort', 'second', 'ice', 'age', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'how', 'bad', 'guys', 'came', 'power', 'why', 'want', 'experiment', 'sewer', 'peopl', 'do', 'know', 'Julie', 'high', 'class', 'call', 'girl', 'day', 'avengger', 'sewer', 'people', 'night', 'above', 'average', 'Sci-Fi', 'B', 'Movie', 'elements', 'Mad', 'Scientist', 'Bad', 'guy', 'love', 'heroine', 'child', 'maternal', 'instinct', 'hero', 'fair', 'amount', 'nudity', 'common', 'kind', 'movie', 'not', 'much', 'action', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'Julie', 'fun', 'watch']",N/A
577380,A1H0CWFQY2HFGG,B00005ALMG,"Bud Bundy ""B movie lover""","[10, 15]","This movie is about a post-apocalyptic world (an asteroid has hit the earth), in which there is the ruling class (consisting of about 5 people) and the ruled class (consisting of about 6 people).Basically, the whole thing looks like it was filmed in a furniture store.  Julie Strain is a terrible, TERRIBLE actress.  If she has three lines to speak, she'll do the first one with a bored expression, the second one with an angry expression, and the third with a happy expression.  It's impossible not to groan.  She walks around topless a lot, but the whole thing is done in such a sleazy way that it's not the least bit erotic.  And then she speaks some monotone text and any possiblity of sensuality is completely lost.The plot consists of her being the head madame for the ruling class.  She lounges around at parties and talks like a sleazy madame.  Then she decides she doesn't like her ""john"" any more, so she joins the resistance.  They fight against the rulers, and guess who wins?This is full of really bad stuff.  If, like me, you look at the cover art and think that this movie couldn't possibly be bad, think again.  Imagine the employees of a strip club making a movie - that's exactly what this is.  Sleazy, not at all sexy, horribly produced, acting that is WAY below even B-movie standards...they couldn't even get the theme music right.  The one person who really steals the show is another member of the stable of females.  She doesn't have any lines, and believe me, in this movie the less you say the better you look in comparison to the rest of the cast.Avoid at all costs.",2,Really terrible,1093046400,"08 21, 2004",2004,1593,"['movie', 'post-apocalyptic', 'world', 'asteroid', 'hit', 'earth', 'ruling', 'class', 'consisting', '5', 'people', 'ruled', 'class', 'consisting', '6', 'people', '.Basically', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'filmed', 'furniture', 'store', 'Julie', 'Strain', 'terrible', 'TERRIBLE', 'actress', 'three', 'lines', 'speak', ""'ll"", 'do', 'first', 'one', 'bored', 'expression', 'second', 'one', 'angry', 'expression', 'third', 'happy', 'expression', 'impossible', 'not', 'groan', 'around', 'topless', 'lot', 'whole', 'thing', 'done', 'such', 'sleazy', 'way', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'erotic', 'then', 'monotone', 'text', 'possiblity', 'sensuality', 'completely', 'lost.The', 'plot', 'being', 'head', 'madame', 'ruling', 'class', 'around', 'parties', 'talks', 'sleazy', 'madame', 'Then', ""n't"", 'like', 'john', 'more', 'resistance', 'fight', 'rulers', 'guess', 'who', 'full', 'really', 'bad', 'stuff', 'look', 'cover', 'art', 'think', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'bad', 'think', 'again', 'Imagine', 'employees', 'strip', 'club', 'making', 'movie', 'exactly', 'what', 'Sleazy', 'not', 'sexy', 'horribly', 'produced', 'acting', 'WAY', 'even', 'B-movie', 'standards', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'theme', 'music', 'right', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'really', 'show', 'member', 'stable', 'females', ""n't"", 'have', 'lines', 'believe', 'movie', 'less', 'say', 'better', 'look', 'comparison', 'rest', 'cast.Avoid', 'costs']",N/A

Munyon,"[1, 1]","About 15 minutes gets edited out for this DVD, and I'm not sure what we missed out on, but I don't think it would have changed my mind about ""Battle Queen 2020.""  Julie Strain was actually in decent shape physically - for her age, when this film was made.  Same goes for Eva Nemeth, the other alleged starlet of this feature.  The premise is a meteor strikes earth, destroys over 90% of the people, causes a nuclear winter and most of the ones left live underground.  A few privileged people live above ground in limited accommodations, called the ""elite.""  The elite get to have the finest things in life, best food, the warmest environment, and the most beautiful women.  Julie Strain is the obvious favorite, and predominates this picture way too lopsidedly.  Prostitution and exploitation of women abounds, and the narration, the acting, and the sets leave the female nudity to carry this film, but for that genre, this time it falls short.  Think of this as a softcore film but with even less story line, and with 5% of the anticipated softcore.  Rated R, filmed in Timmins, Ontario, Canada, released in 2001.  Brigitte Nielsen was considered for the lead actress role, and THAT may have made this film float.  She wasn't in it.  2 stars for the scenery, nothing, for everything else.",2,a little less than B-movie here,1332979200,"03 29, 2012",2012,1289,"['15', 'minutes', 'edited', 'out', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'missed', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'mind', 'Battle', 'Queen', '2020', 'Julie', 'Strain', 'was', 'actually', 'decent', 'shape', 'physically', 'age', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Same', 'Eva', 'Nemeth', 'other', 'alleged', 'starlet', 'feature', 'premise', 'meteor', 'strikes', 'earth', '90', '%', 'people', 'nuclear', 'winter', 'most', 'ones', 'left', 'live', 'underground', 'few', 'privileged', 'people', 'live', 'ground', 'limited', 'accommodations', 'called', 'elite', 'elite', 'get', 'have', 'finest', 'things', 'life', 'best', 'food', 'warmest', 'environment', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'Julie', 'Strain', 'obvious', 'favorite', 'picture', 'way', 'too', 'lopsidedly', 'Prostitution', 'exploitation', 'women', 'abounds', 'narration', 'acting', 'sets', 'leave', 'female', 'nudity', 'carry', 'film', 'genre', 'time', 'short', 'Think', 'softcore', 'film', 'even', 'less', 'story', 'line', '5', '%', 'anticipated', 'softcore', 'Rated', 'R', 'filmed', 'Timmins', 'Ontario', 'Canada', 'released', '2001', 'Brigitte', 'Nielsen', 'was', 'considered', 'lead', 'actress', 'role', 'THAT', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'float', 'was', ""n't"", '2', 'stars', 'scenery', 'nothing', 'everything', 'else']",N/A

I do not review romance movies because it would not be fair to the readers. But I know everyone is trying. This is great camp- as in very good entertaining movie with a beautiful half nude action actress. So, if you've watched Robotrix three times, then you should get or rent this. I did not read anything about this before watching, and I could find no wrong with it at all. Still, it is a very low B movie (which I usually like much), so my rating stands at 4. Definitely not for the over-serious or easily offended.

This movie actually has a plot that isn't to stupid to follow. There is just enough of Julie naked to keep you watching until the plot unfolds and then you might actually care about what's going on in the movie. She is, of course, a bad ... and a babe and in this movie she shows some emotion. Julie is not some bimbo, like Anne Nicole Smith who couldn't act if she had to, it seems like Julie is really trying not to be just another T&A piece.
