341848,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6302870283,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[60, 61]","This tender, and by turns funny and sad film never fails to make me laugh and cry. The 1981 Academy Award winner for Best Foreign Film, it follows the life of three women, starting from 1958 in their youth, where they share a room in a worker's dormitory, then skipping 20 years, to how they've dealt with their lot in life, and what has become of their dreams.The acting is fabulous, and Vera Alentova as Katerina is magnificent. One can feel her exhaustion, her heartbreak, and her incredible inner strength.Perhaps this could be labeled a &quot;woman's movie&quot;, because I think there are scenes that many women will relate to, and think, &quot;I've been there&quot;. It's a story that could take place anywhere in the world, but the Russian settings, and the music (I adore the picnic scene !) are wonderful.There is one huge flaw: The white subtitles sometimes fade into the picture and become unreadable, but I'm not deducting any stars, because the acting is so brilliant, that you won't have to understand Russian to know what is being said.Some might find the final scenes unrealistic and far-fetched, but I would disagree. Life is full of bizarre coincidences and fated events...I find this film strikes a chord of truth, as well as being quite magical.",5,a slice of life,1015891200,"03 12, 2002",2002,1266,"['tender', 'turns', 'funny', 'sad', 'film', 'never', 'make', 'laugh', 'cry', '1981', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'life', 'three', 'women', 'starting', '1958', 'youth', 'where', 'share', 'room', 'worker', 'dormitory', 'then', 'skipping', '20', 'years', 'how', ""'ve"", 'dealt', 'lot', 'life', 'become', 'dreams.The', 'acting', 'fabulous', 'Vera', 'Alentova', 'Katerina', 'magnificent', 'One', 'can', 'feel', 'exhaustion', 'heartbreak', 'incredible', 'inner', 'strength.Perhaps', 'could', 'be', 'labeled', 'quot', 'woman', 'movie', 'quot', 'think', 'are', 'scenes', 'many', 'women', 'will', 'relate', 'think', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'been', 'quot', 'story', 'could', 'take', 'place', 'anywhere', 'world', 'Russian', 'settings', 'music', 'adore', 'picnic', 'scene', 'are', 'wonderful.There', 'one', 'huge', 'flaw', 'white', 'subtitles', 'sometimes', 'fade', 'picture', 'become', 'unreadable', ""'m"", 'not', 'deducting', 'stars', 'acting', 'so', 'brilliant', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'understand', 'Russian', 'know', 'what', 'being', 'said.Some', 'might', 'find', 'final', 'scenes', 'unrealistic', 'far-fetched', 'would', 'disagree', 'Life', 'full', 'bizarre', 'coincidences', 'fated', 'events', 'find', 'film', 'chord', 'truth', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'quite', 'magical']",N/A

I am quite surprised at its popularity, because it is indeed quite unrealistic.  You take an alcoholic who is a wizard that can fix everything, and here you immediately sense that official familiar half-disguised disdain for intellectuals - here, we have a member of the working class who is a real man, although he drinks like a swine.  But it's all right in Russian society; he is such a good man, a real man even!  Beside that, of course, it is a Cinderella story, with a happy end.  To call it the best movie ever is beyond comment, just try Nostalgia or The Mirror for a change.  But is it an entertaining movie - after all, a movie not at all has to be realistic.  I just think it's a bit out of date; it must be hard for people living in Russia now to relate to this good old communist-era times.  And for us, Russians living in America or abroad, it could be only a curiosity, unless it's a severe case of nostalgia.

It's about as ridiculous as the gutter rubbish produced by Hollywood conglomerates. Punctuated by dull, sleep inducing scenes of Russians eating, drinking and discussing nothing in particular, it doesn't really go anywhere. The lives of a few Russian women are given selective treatments, from their work as slaves in the &#34;glorious proletarian&#34; factories, repeating menial tasks, to wanting to get laid. It's not intellectually stimulating, very tedious to behold and has no complicated storyline. People come and go without any loud drums or narrative.What is so infantile is that the writers managed to cram nonsensical and inconsistent story lines just to fit the &#34;required&#34; amount of implantation of central committee doctrine, from mild scenes of elites eating well to the 'happy at the end love scene' that is entirely preposterous and incredulous to believe.Moscow Does not Believe in Tears does not even function as passable entertainment because, frankly said, it's boring. There's not much attempt to examine the women's lives at all, it's just all so very convenient to present us with conflicts and their convenient denouements.It is really hard to believe that Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears (1979) beat out Akira Kurosawa's brilliant and far superior Kagemusha (1980) for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.",2,Stale film from the central committee,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,1590,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Moscow', 'Does', 'Not', 'Believe', 'Tears', '1979', 'stale', 'not', 'so', 'obvious', 'propaganda', 'film', 'central', 'committee', 'was', 'filled', 'backward', 'hypocritical', 'power', 'hungry', 'men', 'who', 'supported', 'tyranny', 'oligarchy', 'as', 'ridiculous', 'gutter', 'rubbish', 'produced', 'Hollywood', 'conglomerates', 'Punctuated', 'dull', 'sleep', 'inducing', 'scenes', 'Russians', 'eating', 'drinking', 'discussing', 'nothing', 'particular', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'lives', 'few', 'Russian', 'women', 'are', 'given', 'selective', 'treatments', 'work', 'slaves', '34', 'glorious', 'proletarian', '34', 'factories', 'repeating', 'menial', 'tasks', 'wanting', 'get', 'laid', 'not', 'intellectually', 'stimulating', 'very', 'tedious', 'behold', 'complicated', 'storyline', 'come', 'go', 'loud', 'drums', 'so', 'infantile', 'writers', 'managed', 'cram', 'nonsensical', 'inconsistent', 'story', 'lines', 'just', 'fit', '34', 'required', '34', 'amount', 'implantation', 'central', 'committee', 'doctrine', 'mild', 'scenes', 'elites', 'eating', 'well', ""'happy"", 'end', 'love', 'scene', 'entirely', 'preposterous', 'incredulous', 'believe.Moscow', 'Does', 'not', 'Believe', 'Tears', 'not', 'even', 'function', 'passable', 'entertainment', 'frankly', 'said', 'boring', 'not', 'much', 'attempt', 'examine', 'women', 'lives', 'just', 'so', 'very', 'convenient', 'present', 'conflicts', 'convenient', 'denouements.It', 'really', 'hard', 'believe', 'Moscow', 'Does', 'Not', 'Believe', 'Tears', '1979', 'beat', 'out', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'brilliant', 'far', 'superior', 'Kagemusha', '1980', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film', 'Oscar']",N/A
341852,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6302870283,Dennis Littrell,"[7, 7]","This is one of the most captivating love stories I've ever seen on film.  It starts with a young woman (Katya, played by Vera Alentova) reporting to her Worker's Dormitory friends that she has flunked by two points the exam to get into university.  It ends with the most incredible sweetness of life.It is like a French film done by a Russian company (which is what it is).  The Moscow we see that does not believe in tears does believe in love, and it is not a Moscow of politics, although some people do call one another ""comrade.""  This is a woman's point of view film (a ""chick flick"") that transcends any genre cage.  It begins slowly, almost painfully dull in a way that will remind the viewer of all the cliches about Russia, the unstylish dress, the worker's paradise that isn't, the sharp contrast between Moscow and the peasants who live outside the city.  Katya works in a factory.  She works at a drill press.  She is obviously underemployed.  Lyudmila (Irina Muravyova) works in a bakery.  She is probably gainfully employed for the time and place.  They are friends, twentysomethings who are on the make for a man, but not a man from the sticks.  They pretend to be university post docs or something close to that and they impress some people as they house-sit a beautiful Moscow apartment.This is how their adult life begins in a sense. Lyudmila falls in love with an athlete; Katya becomes infatuated with a television cameraman.  One thing leads to another and before we know it they are forty.  Neither relationship worked out.  The athlete becomes an alcoholic, the cameraman, in the sway of his mother, believes that Katya is beneath him (once he finds out that she works in a factory).  How wrong he is, of course.But no more of the plot.  I won't spoil it.  The plot is important.  The characterizations are important.  The story is like a Russian novel in that it spans lots of time, but once you are engaged you will find that the two and a half hours fly by and you will, perhaps like me, say at the end ""What a great movie!""My hat is off to director Vladimir Menshov and to Valentin Chernykh who wrote the script and to the cast.

None of us can go back in time and live in the Soviet Union of the 1960s and 1970s, but you CAN view ""Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears"" and get a flavor for what life may have been like in Moscow then. I wouldn't call it a 'chick flick' per se, but there is a love story that resonates as genuine. Made by Russians, about Russians, for Russians. If you are at all interested in Russia and Russian culture, this film is a must.",5,Very Interesting,1186704000,"08 10, 2007",2007,636,"['film', 'interesting', 'glimpse', 'slice', 'Russian', 'life', 'time', 'gone', 'Real', 'life', 'contrived', 'mysteries', 'exploding', 'helicopters', 'dancing', 'penguins', 'etc', 'typical', 'today', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'None', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'live', 'Soviet', 'Union', '1960s', '1970s', 'CAN', 'view', 'Moscow', 'Does', 'Not', 'Believe', 'Tears', 'get', 'flavor', 'what', 'life', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Moscow', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', ""'chick"", 'flick', 'se', 'love', 'story', 'genuine', 'Made', 'Russians', 'about', 'Russians', 'Russians', 'are', 'interested', 'Russia', 'Russian', 'culture', 'film', 'must']",N/A

The women are blue-collar workers, but they try to find white-collar boyfriends. It starts well, but then one of the women (Katerina) unexpectedly gets pregnant. The father (Rudolf) of the baby (Alexandra) doesn't want to marry her.So Katerina cries a lot of tears.Part 2:Many years later, both of the women have children, who have grown up.But the women still don't have good husbands. One of them is alone, and the other is divorced. The one who is alone (Katerina) has a nice job, she became a director. Then she meets a nice man by the name Georgi. He works as a mechanic. They like each other and get together. Unexpectedly, the father of Alexandra comes back and Georgi gets upset and disappears. But then he is found and comes back. So there is a happy end.The movie is cool, because the women are pretty and there is a nice soundtrack song. It's about love and marriage, unlike so many other russian movies, which are about communism and war. The second part is easier to watch, because it happens in times that are closer to the present moment.",5,Russian love story,1163894400,"11 19, 2006",2006,1246,"['film', '2', 'parts.Part', '1', 'Young', 'russian', 'women', 'Moscow', 'try', 'find', 'boyfriends.The', 'events', 'happen', '1950', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'old', 'machines', 'old', 'TV', 'old', 'radios', 'used', 'look', 'women', 'are', 'blue-collar', 'workers', 'try', 'find', 'white-collar', 'boyfriends', 'well', 'then', 'one', 'women', 'Katerina', 'unexpectedly', 'pregnant', 'father', 'Rudolf', 'baby', 'Alexandra', ""n't"", 'want', 'marry', 'her.So', 'Katerina', 'lot', 'tears.Part', '2', 'Many', 'years', 'later', 'women', 'have', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'women', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'good', 'husbands', 'One', 'alone', 'other', 'divorced', 'one', 'who', 'alone', 'Katerina', 'nice', 'job', 'became', 'director', 'Then', 'nice', 'man', 'name', 'Georgi', 'mechanic', 'other', 'get', 'together', 'Unexpectedly', 'father', 'Alexandra', 'back', 'Georgi', 'upset', 'disappears', 'then', 'found', 'back', 'happy', 'end.The', 'movie', 'cool', 'women', 'are', 'pretty', 'nice', 'soundtrack', 'song', 'love', 'marriage', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'russian', 'movies', 'are', 'communism', 'war', 'second', 'part', 'easier', 'watch', 'times', 'are', 'closer', 'present', 'moment']",N/A

We in the US were led to believe that life in the USSR at that time was unbearable and that everyone was fixated on bombing us.  What a gift this film is, if only to dispell those illusions.  These people are definitely Russian but they are shown in such a realistic way that anyone can identify with them, and want to have them over for dinner!

Loved it then, still love it now. Did you know that this film was first experimental movie made in USSR with long run and big budget? &quot;Air Crue&quot; went out right after it, trying to catch up. But it was not as successfull as &quot; Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears&quot;.We didn't care much then about politics, we cared about each other. And the way how we was living and surviving was very simple - we was helping each other. And this is what this film shows at it best - real life, real friends, real meaning of life in our hearts. And this is what I miss so much from that time of my life. And this is what I was trying to find here without much success.
