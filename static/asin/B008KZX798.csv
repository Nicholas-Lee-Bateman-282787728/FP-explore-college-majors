1569676,AG61RUB18I74P,B008KZX798,"A. Magdaleno ""Bibliophile""","[8, 21]","That's probably the best way to describe it, from my point of view. This anime sucks. But before I start my review, I just want to say that i'm no hater. I bought this because I thought it was going to be great! I guess I was thinking it would be like ""Welcome to the NHK!""But don't get me wrong, I didn't go into this comparing and contrasting; I took it for what it was. And here is what I came up with.The story is about a group of NEET's who solve cases. The head of the NEET's is Alice, the mastermind who knows everything. Narumi is the male lead who gets involved, un-willingly, and lands a gig as Alice's assistant. No one else really matters, their roles are to assist the main duo.My problems begin with the first episode. Narumi is dragged into this group of NEET's because his friend Ayaka took him there. Afterwards he begins assisting Alice, who treats him like garbage, with the case of the missing girl. First of all, Alice treats Narumi like trash: she constantly yells at him, berates him, and orders him around. She has absolutely NO redeemable qualities, she ALWAYS speaks in cryptic poetry (she never just plainly states things, always have to listen to a monologue of respecting the dead and being a NEET Detective. She repeats these same monologues at least once per episode), and she is just plain bratty. Second of all, and this is the biggest problem I have with the show, there is no motivation. Nor is there objective!What I mean by this is that Narumi has NO REASON for being there. There is absolutely no reason for Narumi to be helping Alice; Narumi has no stake in anything, Alice does not have anything that Narumi wants, nor does the NEET group supply anything for him. Simply put: Why is Narumi taking all that crap and helping them out in the first place? There is no reason, he just is. At some points in the show he risks his life to discover information for Alice, he does this not knowing why. He starts working for the Ramen shop where the NEET's hang out. He does not know why he is doing this either. How can there be a character who is going to tremendous lengths to solve crimes when he has absolutely no reason for doing it? Does he know these NEET's? No. Does he have a crazy past that he needs to uncover with the help of Alice in exchange for working for her? Nope. No reason, no motivation, no point to the show. It's like the producers didn't really care if Narumi had a reason or not; the creators just wanted Narumi in the group already so they could start doing missions from the first episode!If you can get past that hurdle, then more crap awaits you. The show suffers from tons of lines of useless dialogue. Much of what the characters say can be cut in half and the point would still be made. Tons of useless dialogue without really saying anything at all. The characters don't get to the point, and they talk around the topic, and Alice and Narumi go back and forth about how useless/not useless he is, how she cares/doesn't care about him, making for many moments where you yell at the screen, ""OH GET ON WITH IT ALREADY!""This section is devoted to Alice and how unbelievable she is. She knows EVERYTHING, ALWAYS. She just sits at her computer and solves all the crimes whenever she damn well pleases. She doesn't go out too often, but she still knows what's going on through surveillance cameras and wired people/places. The problem is that she conveniently knows what to do and when. Every single time Narumi and his ""friends"" get stuck on a case, they just go to Alice and she already knows what to do and sends them off. They come back, she again knows exactly what's going on, even though she wasn't there. For example, Narumi hangs out with Renji, a yakuza type leader, and no one knows he is doing this. Come the end of the case when everything hits the fan, Alice recalls the meetings with Narumi and Renji even though Narumi never told anyone in detail about them. Somehow she recalls what they wore, what they talked about, huh? Eff that! At any time that cases go cold, Alice knows exactly what to do, in insane detail, she even knows what people were EXACTLY thinking when they did things, with absolutely no evidence or witnesses of any kind. Dumb! This isn't a detective story, it's a supernatural story where Alice gets her information from demons!This section is devoted to our heartfelt Hero, Narumi! Aside from having no motivation/objective/goal, Narumi is quite the nosy guy. Every time there is a conflict between brother/sister, yakuza leader/yakuza leader, and father/daughter, Narumi is the first one to get in between them and start asking questions and mess around. Every time a conflict arises that is just none of his business (even most of the characters tell him to butt out) he forcibly inserts himself into dangerous situations just to put in his 2 cents, which is ALWAYS, ""There's no way! You're Brother/Father/Friend would never do that! People are good, not bad!"" LAMEAyaka is probably the only character worth investing interest, especially in the last 2 episodes, where this show actually shines. The final episodes actually initiate some great ideas and pull at your heartstrings a bit. The ending is especially nice and endearing. However the rest of the episodes are throwaway tracks, as they say. No re-play value in this show. You know the episodes suck when nothing changes through the course of the show, no cause and effect, nothing lasts. You can watch this show out of order because none of the story arcs have an impact on the others, or the characters.The dub is good, although Narumi started getting annoying towards half-ways.This shows visuals are VERY well done. This show looks beautiful on Blu-Ray and I must say is worth a watch, but not a buy.",1,"Cliche-ridden, really dumb Anime",1354924800,"12 8, 2012",2012,5760,"['probably', 'best', 'way', 'describe',

1569679,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B008KZX798,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[5, 6]","In Japan, the acronym NEET (which stands for not in education, employment, or training) tends to describe people who are shut-ins who avoid real life.  But also describing an otaku culture of people who are addicted to anime, video games and just don't want to assimilate with society and rather stay inside the home without finding a job or pursuing any education.But for light novel writer Hikaru Sugii and illustrator Mel Kishida, the two created a series known as ""Kami-sama no Memo-cho"" (God's Memo Pad) to show a different side of NEET's.In 2007 and a total of eight volumes would be printed by ASCII Media Works.  In 2010, a manga adaptation of the series was illustrated by Tiv and featured in ASCII Media Wroks' ""Dengeki Daioh"" magazine.The anime adaptation was created in July through September 2011 and was produced by J.C. Staff.  And now the anime series, named ""Heaven's Memo Pad"" has made its way to America on Blu-ray courtesy of Sentai Filmworks.The series is directed by Katsushi Sakurabi (""Lunar Legend Tsukihime"", ""Uragiri wa Boku no Namae wo Shitteiru"", ""Melody of Oblivion"", series composition by Seishi Minakami (""G-On Riders"", ""Master Keaton"", ""Kemonozume"", ""Gunparade March"", ""Toaru Kagaku no Railgun""), music by Taku Iwasaki (""Read or Die"", ""Jojo's bizarre Adventure"", ""Gurren Lagann"", ""Black Butler""), character design by Keiichi Sano (""A Certain Magical Index"", ""A Certain Scientific Railgun"") and art backgrounds by Yutaka Onishi (""Girls und Panzer"").VIDEO:""Heaven's Memo Pad"" is presented in 1080p High Definition.  As a fan of the work from J.C. Staff, the character designs for the anime series.  It's important to remember that this is a TV series and not an OVA, so you are going to see a bit of softness at times.  But for the most part, this series is colorful, character designs are really well-done and are well-shaded.  Art backgrounds are well-detailed and while the series does utilize a lot of close-ups, the capturing of emotion and city surroundings is nicely done.AUDIO:The lossless soundtrack features an English and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 soundtrack.  While the series is front-channel driven, both are equal when it comes to the use of the front channels.  As for voice acting, both are also well-done and acting from both the Japanese and American talent will satisfy viewers.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Heaven's Memo Pad"" comes with the clean opening and closing animation.  Plus Sentai trailers.JUDGMENT CALL:""Heaven's Memo Pad"" is an enjoyable anime series about an introverted teenager who makes new friends when he joins their NEET Detective Agency.Part of the fascinating points of why people will enjoy this series are its characters.  While Narumi is the introvert, it's hard to see how these others are NEET's but they are.  Alice is an intelligent hacker, but one must wonder how this teenager is not in school, not living with parents and has access to this expensive hardware.  We don't know too much about Alice but she is the key person that everyone tries to protect and works for.You also have a group of characters that seem unlikely NEET's, Ayaka, the happy teen; Tetsuo the boxer/gambler; Major the military otaku and Hiroaki the gigolo.  And then you have a yakuza leader known as ""The Fourth"" but he runs a group full of troglodyte members who thinks Narumi is a master for being able to do the most simplest things on the computer.So, because of these characters, you can't help but laugh and gigle at times.Especially when it comes to Narumi and Alice.  Because Alice is anti-social and really doesn't get out much, the group puts in her head that Narumi sniff's her dolls, since she sleeps with them so closely.  So, she kind of thinks that Narumi is a pervert.  And quite often, Ayaka and even Meo try to give Alice a bath or hair treatment, but when she calls Narumi for help, by the time Narumi gets there, the girls think that Narumi is trying to get a sneak peak and is labeled a pervert.  So, there are some fun and crazy moments throughout the anime series.But of course, each episode revolves around a case.  From a Thai girl named Meo's who's father is missing but all they have is a bag full of money.  Was her father connected to organized crime? Another features The Fourth going to Narumi to help with promotions for  band. Another situation revolving around a person once connected with ""The Fourth"", to the group taking part in a baseball game against a yakuza leader who was once a star pitcher.  But the most emotional episodes relate to Narumi, as the return of Ayaka's brother has led to trouble and with her in a coma.Suffice to say, while the series has its share of laughs and serious moments, the final three episodes are my favorite because we get to see everyone really going all out to help their friend who nearly died from an attempted suicide.  And Narumi and Alice are intent on finding out why someone so cheerful, tried to end her life.As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is very good in HD, lossless stereo soundtrack is good but not too immersive since it's more of a front-channel dialogue-driven series.  And for special features, it's primarily the clean opening and ending animation.Overall, ""Heaven's Memo Pad"" is  a fascinating series from beginning to end, I can only hope that we see another season of the series because I'm hooked!  Beautiful animation, fun yet compelling story and fascinating characters!""Heaven's Memo Pad"" is recommended!",4,"Heaven's Memo Pad"" is  a fascinating series from beginning to end, I can only hope

1569680,A21IFUGVOAMTRD,B008KZX798,DvtDude,"[4, 8]","First let me say I have seen this anime three times through already and I have been waiting for the american release for God knows how long.The story revolves around a wonderful cast of characters and throughout the season you are going to see about three to four different episodes arcs, each different and wonderful in their own way. The story is about a young girl named Alice who stays locked away in her room surrounded by computer monitors so she can watch the world, you see, Alice is a detective and a genius when it comes to hacking. With a wonderful team at her side it seems any case is not too difficult for her.The other main character is a rather shy quiet boy named Narumi. What I like about this show is instead of staying the same through majority of the show we see him grow up and take on real challenges through life and grow more mature. Actually a lot of the characters are like this. There are no one dimensional characters here. The story is not only plot driven but very character driven as well.So as I said there are a couple different episode arcs, each spanning a unique story. For the most part they start the same, someone approaches Alice for a job and they have to figure out ""who done it.""

I will start by saying that I got this anime thinking it was like Death Note however it is notting like it but that's not a bad thing.  I like a good story line along with good graphics and as far as the story line it is pretty good not too complex but still good. Graphic wise it's great no cheap stuff. I will not say much about the ending other then it was not disappointing like other anime. All in all I give this anime a good review and I recommend it to anyone that's trying to watch something new but not stay on it for too long since it does not have that many episodes.,4,Great anime,1352851200,"11 14, 2012",2012,634,"['anime', 'dvd', 'formate', '3', 'disks', 'will', 'start', 'saying', 'got', 'anime', 'thinking', 'was', 'like', 'Death', 'Note', 'however', 'notting', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'good', 'graphics', 'as', 'far', 'story', 'line', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'too', 'complex', 'still', 'good', 'Graphic', 'wise', 'great', 'cheap', 'stuff', 'will', 'not', 'say', 'much', 'ending', 'other', 'then', 'was', 'not', 'disappointing', 'other', 'anime', 'give', 'anime', 'good', 'review', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'trying', 'watch', 'something', 'new', 'not', 'stay', 'too', 'long', 'not', 'have', 'many', 'episodes']",N/A

Ayaka, the only other member of his gardening club, and maybe his only friend, invites him to go meet her friend that lives above a ramen shop. Alice is a NEET. Don't let her hear you call her that though. She prefers to be called a NEET detective. She is hold up in her apartment with her many computers, stuffed animals, and hacking skills. She takes on cases that seem impossible to solve. Narumi is dragged into working as Alice's assistant. Along with Alice's posse, he does the running for her to solve the cases. He also does the delivering for the hot ramen shop owner below. He's about to enter a world of weirdness and danger.This anime is pretty darn good. It has a lot of good mysteries, suspense, action, drama, and comedy. The animation is great, the soundtrack is cool, the voice actors are among some of the best, and the vibe created is really addicting. This anime grows on you more after each episode.

She lives in a room surrounded by stuffed animals and computer screens using her information gathering talents to solve matters that come her way. But then you watch an episode...and then you realize you watched the entire season and are begging for more.The series name is actually Kamisama no Memochou which translates out to ""God's Notebook (can be Memopad or similar term but notebook sounds better)."" Why American publishers felt they needed to change the name, dunno. Take it as a sign of how much you miss when you only watch anime in English dubs. But anyways, the story revolves around Alice and Narumi who has his school life completely changed after he is drawn into Alice's detective work. Each episode is well done and the story flows better than most anime on the market. It has a bit of an older age feel to it like you see in Josei (adult female) style anime but demographic targeted is more akin to Seinen (adult male). The story does start in a school but you will find yourself wondering how Narumi's school life is even continuing with the amount of detective work being done. It isn't like common anime where the boy is a student by day and a hero by night.In this series you will see at least a couple arcs. Later episodes will throw you a curve ball of drama at times. Literally there is one event that happens that will leave you speechless as a character deals with some real dark problems. I myself remember watching as it aired and thinking,""did that just really happen? Did I just see that?"" When the moment happens, don't stop watching. See the rest of the story. It will be worth it, trust me.Aside from that the characters, while following some similar archetypes, are very enjoyable. The one factor which gets a bit tiring about the show is the amount of Yakuza themes going on. At first it seems like it is just promoting the group mentality Japanese youths are taught. You will notice the theme early on but then later it just gets even more prevalent and shifts into Yakuza territory. While it isn't a bad thing, it does start to feel a little tired out near the end. Like the scenes are being drawn out a bit too much. It detracted slightly from the anime but thankfully the story moved along before it got bothersome.Overall this is a great show, one of the best that aired the season it aired on. Hopefully others that aired that season like God Dolls will get a release here as well. There was a lot of good anime airing when it did. Till then, enjoy God's Notebook!
