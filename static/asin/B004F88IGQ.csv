This was surprisingly good.  Afterwards I bought a copy for myself.A group of teens go camping, and return to find their homes have been invaded and their families captured.They retreat back to the wild, and slowly retrain themselves as guerilla fighters. They had no military training of any kind.  Just teens making it up as they went along.The group's strongest characters were Ellie who was a natural leader, and Homer who was a punk with an instinct for mayhem and explosives - a rebel without a cause. Beyond that the group involved a nice variety.  Fiona - a sensual blond and Homer's crush. Corrie -  Ellie's best friend. Kevin - Corrie's crush.  Robyn - an innocent religious girl.  Lee - Ellie's crush.The invasion brought them all together.  It gave Ellie a reason to lead.  Gave Homer a cause worth fighting for - he goes from punk to warrior.  Their feelings strengthened as they trained - crushes became love, friendship became family.On their first attack they made the kinds of mistakes real teens could make - first accidentally shutting off a walkie talkie, and second the girls leaving themselves vulnerable because they got caught up in girl talk.  That was believable and excellent comic relief.  Despite those mistakes, they succeeded in destroying a bridge that the invaders relied on.At the very end they had fully become soldiers, fighting to reclaim their homes.",5,Unexpected pleasure,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,1508,"['found', 'video', 'rental', 'Just', 'rented', 'bunch', 'low-price', 'general', 'titles', 'hoping', 'least', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Afterwards', 'bought', 'copy', 'myself.A', 'group', 'teens', 'go', 'camping', 'return', 'find', 'homes', 'have', 'been', 'invaded', 'families', 'captured.They', 'retreat', 'back', 'wild', 'slowly', 'retrain', 'guerilla', 'fighters', 'had', 'military', 'training', 'kind', 'Just', 'teens', 'making', 'up', 'went', 'along.The', 'group', 'strongest', 'characters', 'were', 'Ellie', 'who', 'was', 'natural', 'leader', 'Homer', 'who', 'was', 'punk', 'instinct', 'mayhem', 'rebel', 'cause', 'group', 'involved', 'nice', 'variety', 'Fiona', 'sensual', 'blond', 'Homer', 'crush', 'Corrie', 'Ellie', 'best', 'friend', 'Kevin', 'Corrie', 'crush', 'Robyn', 'innocent', 'religious', 'girl', 'Lee', 'Ellie', 'crush.The', 'invasion', 'brought', 'together', 'gave', 'Ellie', 'reason', 'lead', 'Gave', 'Homer', 'cause', 'worth', 'fighting', 'punk', 'warrior', 'feelings', 'strengthened', 'trained', 'crushes', 'became', 'love', 'friendship', 'became', 'first', 'attack', 'made', 'kinds', 'mistakes', 'real', 'teens', 'could', 'make', 'first', 'accidentally', 'shutting', 'off', 'walkie', 'talkie', 'second', 'girls', 'leaving', 'vulnerable', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'girl', 'talk', 'was', 'believable', 'excellent', 'comic', 'relief', 'mistakes', 'succeeded', 'destroying', 'bridge', 'invaders', 'relied', 'very', 'end', 'had', 'fully', 'become', 'soldiers', 'fighting', 'reclaim', 'homes']",N/A

The premise is that a group of teenage friends are away camping in the Australian outback when Australia is invaded. They come home to their rural homes to find them deserted and with signs of violent struggle. It is as if everybody vanished. Panicking, the go from home to home trying to solve the mystery. They ultimately find that they have been invaded (though who the force is is never explicityly stated, a strong point that will allow the books and the movie to age well) and that their families, friends and neighbors are in POW camps.Shell-shocked the group seeks shelter, sanctuary and allies and ultimately a plan. This is a story about how a group of teenagers turns itself into an effective guerilla force against an armed invader. Learning the lessons of others who tried to fight back too soon, they take their time, ultimately closing off access to their community. The writing, acting and setting are all top-notch.

1404797,A2582KMXLK2P06,B004F88IGQ,B. E Jackson,"[4, 5]","What I like about Tomorrow: When the War Began is that it takes typical teenagers who love to party, go on camping trips, fall in love, etc and suddenly turns them into killing machines against their will.  If I started watching this movie without knowing its name or what it's about, I'd have NO idea that after the first 30 minutes of (to be honest) cliched writing that things would change *dramatically*.When the teens come home and discover that their parents are missing, they drive around their abandoned town and search for clues on what happened.  Maybe it's just me but I LOVE the mystery and atmosphere that surrounds these type of storylines so I'm *already* enticed.Now I can understand those who didn't particularly like this movie would strong have a problem with the fact that it's totally unbelievable that typical teens would miraculously find themselves narrowly escaping danger whenever confronted in such a situation, however the magic is that in the land of movies I really see no problem with it whatsoever.  The atmosphere is intense, the acting is a step above the rest, the gradual change in attitude and maturity that the teens experience as the war intensifies and the confrontations become more violent and numerous... these are things I definitely admire.  You really care about these teens and want them to defeat all obstacles and survive.  The one segment with the helicopter shining a light through the temporary home the teens were staying in is a perfect example of such intensity.  Yes we've seen similar segments in dozens of other films but there's always a feeling of mystery whether the bad guys will discover that people are living there.Oh and the one female of the group is arguably the best actress of the bunch.  At one point the violence and confusion became so much that she actually started turning against her own friends by pointing guns at them and losing control before the realization set in that she's taking the warzone situation too far.  I loved it.Of course it's not without one major flaw.  That being the ending.  Man this movie was flowing on SUCH a perfect, adrenaline-pumping pace that the way it just abruptly ends left me with a sour taste in my mouth.  No need for that at all- a proper ending should have been writen and given.  It's only fair given the amount of attention concerning everything *else* that took place.  Another small problem is that the entire film feels very American-ized, and not the least bit Australian (despite the slight accent).  On the plus side, it's very easy to make out their accents.

Starts off innocently and freewheeling enough as they leave a small country Wirrawee town somewhere in NSW. One night one of the kids awakens to the sound of squadrons of jets zooming overhead... and goes back to sleep thinking nothing of it.When the teenagers pack up and return from their ""secret"" grotto which they established is theirs, they find most of the homes abandoned,families missing, power out,dogs shot dead, and vehicles burning. Going further into the center of town by nightfall they soon see the truth: Australia has been invaded by an unknown, Asian ""Coalition"" possibly Chinese, Indonesian or Burmese-or all of them. Brutal and uncompromising, anyone arguing with them in the ""indoctrination"" prison camps they've set up is shot dead.The group, unknown at this point to the invaders, runs back into the country homes to hide, and start making plans to defend their town and rescue their loved ones. They also realize the massive scope of this war with various radio snippets and the shocking realization that the world cannot help them, they're on their own. The smaller Australia forces are overwhelmed by the massive invasion which seeks to annex Australia for it's natural resources and vast areas of open land. They become guerilla fighters taking the battle to the enemy on their own terms. WHen they realize the enemy has figured out they are hiding in their family's homes(one is completely firebombed) they retreat further to their hard to access vacation grotto and start making more ambitous plans.Overall pretty good film, filled with teenage angst and doubts and some fairly good special effects, one depicting an air battle.",4,"Australia's ""Red Dawn"".",1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,1910,"['Based', 'series', 'bestselling', 'young', 'adult', 'author', 'James', 'Marsden', 'books', 'details', 'lives', 'teenagers', 'living', 'out', 'last', 'bit', 'fun', 'adventurous', 'road', 'trip/camping', 'vacation', 'remote', 'area', 'school', 'come', 'back', 'session', 'innocently', 'freewheeling', 'enough', 'leave', 'small', 'country', 'Wirrawee', 'town', 'somewhere', 'NSW', 'One', 'night', 'one', 'kids', 'sound', 'squadrons', 'jets', 'zooming', 'overhead', 'back', 'sleep', 'thinking', 'nothing', 'it.When', 'teenagers', 'pack', 'up', 'return', 'secret', 'grotto', 'established', 'theirs', 'find', 'most', 'homes', 'abandoned', 'families', 'missing', 'power', 'dogs', 'shot', 'dead', 'vehicles', 'burning', 'Going', 'further', 'center', 'town', 'nightfall', 'soon', 'see', 'truth', 'Australia', 'been', 'invaded', 'unknown', 'Asian', 'Coalition', 'possibly', 'Chinese', 'Indonesian', 'Burmese-or', 'Brutal', 'uncompromising', 'anyone', 'arguing', 'indoctrination', 'prison', 'camps', ""'ve"", 'set', 'up', 'shot', 'dead.The', 'group', 'unknown', 'point', 'invaders', 'back', 'country', 'homes', 'hide', 'start', 'making', 'plans', 'defend', 'town', 'rescue', 'loved', 'ones', 'also', 'realize', 'massive', 'scope', 'war', 'various', 'radio', 'snippets', 'shocking', 'realization', 'world', 'can', 'not', 'help', ""'re"", 'own', 'smaller', 'Australia', 'forces', 'are', 'overwhelmed', 'massive', 'invasion', 'annex', 'Australia', 'natural', 'resources', 'vast', 'areas', 'open', 'land', 'become', 'guerilla', 'fighters', 'taking', 'battle', 'enemy', 'own', 'terms', 'realize', 'enemy', 'figured', 'out', 'are', 'hiding', 'family', 'homes', 'one', 'completely', 'firebombed', 'retreat', 'further', 'hard', 'access', 'vacation', 'grotto', 'start', 'making', 'more', 'ambitous', 'plans.Overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'filled', 'teenage', 'angst', 'doubts', 'fairly', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'one', 'depicting', 'air', 'battle']",N/A

Stuart Beattie, 2010, 105 minutes) is a remake ofRed Dawn ('84)that I found fun, humorous and simple. Sometimes those things are all it takes to make a fun, entertaining and somehow profound film. This as far as I can tell was just released on DVD (I watched it on cable) and I know two more films are in the offing, numbers 2 (this year, 2012) and 3 (2013).I know the films are probably done by now and that the rest of the story - because there will be more - will eventually be made into a TV series but I cannot say when that will be.In this film, a group of sexy-looking Aussie teens witness what I can only guess is a Chinese invasion of Australia (second guess is North Korean, because this invading race is meant to be confusing and even their language is a garbled invention). With their harbor town invaded and seized, they sneak in and quickly transform into a guerrilla force. Their first major accomplishment - achieved at the end of the movie - is the dropping of the major bridge into town.I know, I know: too much like Spielberg light. But hang on a tick ... this film is GOOD as far as it goes. The fx are killer, no need for 3D here when you shoot the scene right, that is for sure. This director knows what he's doing. The acting is not quite what I like to call ""quackting"" because these are 20-somethings posing as teens, so one expects them to be humorous and silly. But they can actually act too, and this helps along the rather dark humor that pops up repeatedly.This is a simple vehicle about a bunch of sexy kids waving their tushies and showing off their assets, lots of great action with explosions and what I think is one of the best scenes ever filmed (when they are attacked at one of the houses by a detachment of soldiers). And it poses a very deep pair of questions: 1. What does the world do if Australia is invaded by gazillions of mad Asians? 2. What does a bunch of silly kids do when they are at liberty but are witnessing the invasion of their country?The thoughts/ideas struck me as vital, the silliness of the young adult novel notwithstanding. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and found a lot of it touching. It was a stunner to me to see that it is the start of a series, because that always makes me feel robbed and angry. Here I did not mind so much, because I feel as if this film stands well on its own.Honestly, I would not care to see another film which would be a ""nyquel"" [my term] anyway - and I do not care how this story ends. This film ended extremely well, and we can see it just Part One halfway through anyway. Hopefully America is watching as more and more Australian film is made - and hopefully we will indeed get to see these films.With the stunning and thoroughly wonderful talents of Caitlin Stasey, the better-known Rachel Hurd-Wood, Lincoln Lewis, Deniz Akdeniz, Phoebe Tonkin, Chris Pang, Ashleigh Cummings, Andrew Ryan, and very well-known in Australia Colin Friels.",4,"Aussie slam-bang fun, part 1 of a new trilogy",1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,2967,"['TOMORROW', 'WHEN', 'THE', 'WAR', 'BEGAN', 'Dir', 'Stuart', 'Beattie', '2010', '105', 'minutes', 'remake', 'ofRed', 'Dawn', 'found', 'fun', 'humorous', 'simple', 'Sometimes', 'things', 'are', 'make', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'somehow', 'profound', 'film', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'just', 'released', 'DVD', 'watched', 'cable', 'know', 'two', 'more', 'films', 'are', 'offing', 'numbers', '2', 'year', '2012', '3', '2013', '.I', 'know', 'films', 'are', 'probably', 'done', 'now', 'rest', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'made', 'TV', 'series', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'when', 'will', 'be.In', 'film', 'group', 'sexy-looking', 'Aussie', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'Chinese', 'invasion', 'Australia', 'second', 'guess', 'North', 'Korean', 'invading', 'race', 'meant', 'be', 'confusing', 'even', 'language', 'garbled', 'invention', 'harbor', 'town', 'invaded', 'seized', 'sneak', 'quickly', 'transform', 'guerrilla', 'force', 'first', 'major', 'accomplishment', 'achieved', 'end', 'movie', 'dropping', 'major', 'bridge', 'town.I', 'know', 'know', 'too', 'much', 'Spielberg', 'light', 'hang', 'tick', 'film', 'GOOD', 'as', 'far', 'fx', 'are', 'killer', 'need', '3D', 'here', 'when', 'shoot', 'scene', 'right', 'sure', 'director', 'what', 'doing', 'acting', 'not', 'quite', 'what', 'like', 'call', 'quackting', 'are', '20-somethings', 'posing', 'teens', 'one', 'be', 'humorous', 'silly', 'can', 'actually', 'act', 'too', 'rather', 'dark', 'humor', 'up', 'repeatedly.This', 'simple', 'vehicle', 'bunch', 'sexy', 'kids', 'waving', 'tushies', 'showing', 'off', 'assets', 'lots', 'great', 'action', 'explosions', 'what', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'ever', 'filmed', 'when', 'are', 'attacked', 'one', 'houses', 'detachment', 'soldiers', 'very', 'deep', 'pair', 'questions', '1', 'What', 'world', 'do', 'Australia', 'invaded', 'gazillions', 'mad', 'Asians', '2', 'What', 'bunch', 'silly', 'kids', 'do', 'when', 'are', 'liberty', 'are', 'witnessing', 'invasion', 'country', 'thoughts/ideas', 'struck', 'vital', 'silliness', 'young', 'adult', 'novel', 'notwithstanding', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'found', 'lot', 'touching', 'was', 'stunner', 'see', 'start', 'series', 'always', 'feel', 'robbed', 'angry', 'Here', 'did', 'not', 'mind', 'so', 'much', 'feel', 'film', 'well', 'own.Honestly', 'would', 'not', 'care', 'see', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'nyquel', 'term', ']', 'anyway', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'how', 'story', 'film', 'ended', 'extremely', 'well', 'can', 'see', 'just', 'Part', 'One', 'halfway', 'anyway', 'Hopefully', 'America', 'watching', 'more', 'more', 'Australian', 'film', 'made', 'hopefully', 'will', 'indeed', 'get', 'see', 'films.With', 'stunning', 'thoroughly', 'wonderful', 'talents', 'Caitlin', 'Stasey', 'better-known', 'Rachel', 'Hurd-Wood', 'Lincoln', 'Lewis', 'Deniz', 'Akdeniz', 'Phoebe', 'Tonkin', 'Chris', 'Pang', 'Ashleigh', 'Cummings', 'Andrew', 'Ryan', 'very', 'well-known', 'Australia', 'Colin', 'Friels']",N/A

The only similarity is that both have an invading force. Red Dawn is  total action picture, the stars looked more or less like average teens in Anytown USA and the action began in the first few minutes and continued until the final few.  The body count of bad guys was satisfyingly high, and the ending wrapped things up pretty well, in its own way.""TWTWB"" on the other hand, is beautifully photographed, stars beautiful people, has beautiful scenery, Australian outback, wilderness, waterfalls. the young people don't look much like anyone that I knew in high school or university days, but then, if I had lived in Hollywood or Australia, maybe they wold have all had that warm glowing appearance.Action: The action in this movie does not begin until about three-quarters of the way through. If you expect the ambush the bad guys, snipe them from cover, etc., then you will be sorely disappointed. The main bit of action involves blowing up a bridge. period.There is no 'character development' of the enemy, and the reasons for invasion are given in a very cursory, perfunctory way, having a vague connection to the world's diminishing resources and the need for the communist approach to 'sharing the wealth' by taking everything that everyone has, killing or imprisoning anyone who objects, and sending the natural resources back to Mother China.The 'ending' is merely a scene of the grim but still beautiful young crew, riding off into the sunset - or maybe it was the dawn, I was a bit numb by then - vowing to fight the good fight.

1404813,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B004F88IGQ,Jason,"[0, 0]","Before going too much into the merits of the film, several of the more commonly critiqued aspects of the film should be discussed.  Yes, just about every main character is fairly attractive.  This is a somehow a flaw for TWTWB, but nobody complained about Swayze, Sheen, Howell, Grey, and Thompson all camping together.  Although, the clich&eacute;d cast assembly was sort of irritating.  I'd much rather have seen two of race X, three of race Y, or a split down the middle, than the random token addition of one Asian guy.  The likelihood of them inviting a guy they hardly know - no matter how interesting he may be - is highly unlikely.  Some have pointed to the fact there is more melodrama than action.  I agree with this concept, but since this film is just the beginning of a series, I'm hoping the next films get deeper into the action like Red Dawn.  Of course, had it all been squeezed into one movie, it could have taken away from the screenplay and character development - the latter I kind of enjoyed.  Yes, they make childish and nonstrategic decisions even while engaging their occupiers.  Well, this is Australia, not Afghanistan; maybe they're just not really mentally prepared for this type of life yet?With all that said, if you're actively seeking an Aussie version of Red Dawn, this film more than satisfies.  The actors are more than capable while not being exactly polished.  I believe this adds a small semblance of realism to the film because nobody in an ""unknown forces just body-slammed my entire country and are now occupying it while killing randomly""-situation is going to be cool, calm, and collected.  Whereas Red Dawn goes from hunting rifles to RPGs in a blink of an eye, TWTWB takes a slower, more cautious approach that falls in line with the characters' likely trepidation.  If Red Dawn were set up as a trilogy, it would have most likely not had them going on full ambush missions with tactical precision within ten minutes of their predicament's realization.  I would be remiss if the Australian landscape were not mentioned.  Much of Red Dawn's beauty exists in the beautifully remote New Mexico forests, and TWTWB more than fills that with the picturesque views from various locations within New South Wales.Overall I was very pleased with this film.  Sure, it can be nit-picked apart like the majority of films produced today, but I enjoyed it quite a bit because I was able to accept it for what it is.

1404814,A98M1UJWF8D92,B004F88IGQ,"John E. Larsen ""Larso""","[18, 19]","This is the film adaption of John Marsden's 1993 novel of a group of teenagers caught up in a foreign invasion of Australia. In short - it's great! Given the books popularity, I had some concerns that the film might not do it justice and it might look like `Home & Away' (Australian TV Soap) goes to war! But the actors, most with TV acting experience, do a creditable job and aren't there solely for their looks or profile. For the most part they fit what a normal group of teens would look like and as the action kicks in they take on a suitably unkempt look anyway. Of the key characters, Homer was very good and most importantly, Ellie worked for me too. There was a surprise or two in terms of casting choices and frankly Robyn will not work for everyone. A real plus was that some of the secondary characters get more exposure than in the book. The interactions between them all are fine, with the humour in particular being well delivered. For those concerned about coarser things, there is a little bit of sexual conversation but no nudity, some low level drug use and I'm pleased to say minimal bad language.With a film adaption there are always a few tweaks to the original story and I have to say that for me, these all worked quite well and in a number of scenes, were very good. There was also some additional information on the wider situation with the war and this was most welcome given the book is very vague on this aspect. All the key events in the book are there and the film makers did a good job constructing them. There are plenty of explosions and the war violence is conveyed in a stronger manner than in the book. It is quite action packed and I found it to be genuinely exciting at times! It is not Mad Max and it shouldn't be either. It is a film made for a modern teen audience and those who enjoyed the book - as a teen or otherwise.Military obsessives will find a few faults in how the enemy army is depicted. They're not the most efficient army ever either but they are certainly very violent at times and make suitable villains. There are some updates in terms of the technology that wasn't around in 1993 and also some fun, topical youth-culture humour and moments. The final scene is a bit hokey but the vision of the walk into 'Hell' is jawdropping!

This is political correctness gone wacko.  If somebody invaded my country and locked people up in concentration type camps.  I would be pissed and would grab the first gun i could find and take as many of them out as possible.  I sure would not worry about whether or not we as a country had offended or perhaps not helped these folks enough.  That being said the movie is good and the story is enjoyable if you can get past the P.C. crapola.

1404816,A1ZJJWF69R31ZL,B004F88IGQ,"Kate Fredericks ""Kate""","[1, 1]","I'm not even going to begin to read the other reviews about this movie because I can see it's already being vilified for reasons I cannot fathom. I watched this movie only because it looked decent and had a sci fi apocalyptic storyline. I also did some research into the making of this movie. It was one of the first all-Australian produced big, expensive movies and for that alone, I wish people would give it a break. I actually loved this movie. I thought it had a wonderful story, some very good acting, great special effects, and I never got bored.SPOILER ALERT.....This movie is about eight teenagers who go on a camping trip to a place in the wilderness called Hell, which is a truly beautiful spot, perfect for being alone and didn't seem like hell at all. They spend several days there, where they bond and we get to know the characters, which, for me, was why I liked the movie so much. It was a great way for the audience to get to know the characters before all the action begins. When they go back home, they find their homes are deserted, a dead dog, and unnerving silence. Instead of running into town and getting caught, they waited until dark and then went into town where all the action begins. We find out that their town is in a perfect spot for some sort of asian country to invade their country and use it as a dropping off point. One problem is that there is only one bridge for them to get out and into the rest of Australia.What I liked, besides the way this group came together, did some very careful things to NOT be caught, and ultimately set up a plan to destroy the bridge, thus cutting off the asian troops from getting onto the mainland, was how smart they were. These were not your usual potty mouthed, lazy teens we all know and love, but teens who obviously are a cut above. They are obviously nice kids. Say what you want, but frankly I am tired of these ""coming of age"" movies, etc. where the teens learn some lesson about drugs, sex, alcohol or fill in the blank. These are simply kids who are faced with a serious crisis, don't moan and groan about it, they simply act. It's not quite as perfect as I am painting it. There was some angst in all of it, but on the whole, when the end finally came, I felt like jumping up and down and clapping for these courageous teens who put their country and family first and came up with a plan to stop the invasion.It wasn't a perfect movie, but I gave it 5 stars because it's the first movie about teenagers in a long time where I felt good about them in the end. It's a fairly smart movie. Not filled with slashers, or monsters, or alcoholic, abusive parents, or just plain bad attitudes. Just good, smart kids who made a good plan and followed through with special effects that were worthy of a big budget Hollywood film. So, GOOD FOR THEM!As for whether we'll see the 2nd or 3rd part of this trilogy is still up in the air. There are loose plans to start work on the 2nd movie, but my contact in Australia has been in contact with the movie company and could not get a definitive answer from them. It seems to me that instead of us Americans/Canadians/UKers used to producing big budget films (most of them crap if you ask me), we should be encouraging them, even helping them to build their own productions. Australia is not a rich country, and yet I think they produced a fine film with positive role models. I LOVED this movie and would really like to see the 2nd and 3rd movie made, as good or better than the first one. However, because of the tepid reaction of us snobby northerners, it's not likely to happen. And for that, I am really sorry. I love my country, don't get me wrong. Hollywood is another story. Not so much! I also know that Red Dawn was released around the same time as Tomorrow, and I suspect there was some blow back from that. Too bad because Tomorrow deserved better! It was a great movie and I would encourage you to watch it if you haven't already. And please keep an open mind and don't let any of the reviews (except mine :-) dissuade you from enjoying it as much as I did!",5,I LOVED This Movie,1362009600,"02 28, 2013",2013,4085,"[""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'going', 'begin', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'already', 'being', 'vilified', 'reasons', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'watched', 'movie', 'only', 'looked', 'decent', 'had', 'sci', 'fi', 'apocalyptic', 'storyline', 'also', 'did', 'research', 'making', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'all-Australian', 'produced', 'big', 'expensive', 'movies', 'alone', 'wish', 'people', 'would', 'give', 'break', 'actually', 'loved', 'movie', 'thought', 'had', 'wonderful', 'story', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'never', 'got', 'bored.SPOILER', 'ALERT', '..This', 'movie', 'eight', 'teenagers', 'who', 'go', 'camping', 'trip', 'place', 'wilderness', 'called', 'Hell', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'spot', 'perfect', 'being', 'alone', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'hell', 'spend', 'several', 'days', 'there', 'where', 'bond', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'was', 'why', 'liked', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'great', 'way', 'audience', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'action', 'When', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'find', 'homes', 'are', 'deserted', 'dead', 'dog', 'unnerving', 'silence', 'Instead', 'running', 'town', 'getting', 'caught', 'waited', 'dark', 'then', 'went', 'town', 'where', 'action', 'find', 'out', 'town', 'perfect', 'spot', 'sort', 'asian', 'country', 'invade', 'country', 'use', 'dropping', 'off', 'point', 'One', 'problem', 'only', 'one', 'bridge', 'get', 'out', 'rest', 'Australia.What', 'liked', 'way', 'group', 'came', 'together', 'did', 'very', 'careful', 'things', 'NOT', 'be', 'caught', 'ultimately', 'set', 'up', 'plan', 'destroy', 'bridge', 'thus', 'cutting', 'off', 'asian', 'troops', 'getting', 'mainland', 'was', 'how', 'smart', 'were', 'were', 'not', 'usual', 'potty', 'mouthed', 'lazy', 'teens', 'know', 'love', 'teens', 'who', 'obviously', 'are', 'cut', 'are', 'obviously', 'nice', 'kids', 'Say', 'what', 'want', 'frankly', 'am', 'tired', 'coming', 'age', 'movies', 'etc', 'where', 'teens', 'learn', 'lesson', 'drugs', 'sex', 'alcohol', 'fill', 'blank', 'are', 'simply', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'faced', 'serious', 'crisis', 'do', ""n't"", 'moan', 'groan', 'simply', 'act', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'perfect', 'am', 'painting', 'was', 'angst', 'whole', 'when', 'end', 'finally', 'came', 'felt', 'jumping', 'up', 'down', 'clapping', 'courageous', 'teens', 'who', 'put', 'country', 'family', 'first', 'came', 'up', 'plan', 'stop', 'invasion.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'movie', 'gave', '5', 'stars', 'first', 'movie', 'teenagers', 'long', 'time', 'where', 'felt', 'good', 'end', 'fairly', 'smart', 'movie', 'Not', 'filled', 'slashers', 'monsters', 'alcoholic', 'abusive', 'parents', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'attitudes', 'Just', 'good', 'smart', 'kids', 'who', 'made', 'good', 'plan', 'followed', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'worthy', 'big', 'budget', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'So', 'GOOD', 'FOR', 'THEM', ""'ll"", 'see', '2nd', '3rd', 'part', 'trilogy', 'still', 'up', 'air', 'are', 'loose', 'plans', 'start', 'work', '2nd', 'movie', 'contact', 'Australia', 'been', 'contact', 'movie', 'company', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'definitive', 'answer', 'instead', 'Americans/Canadians/UKers', 'used', 'producing', 'big', 'budget', 'films', 'most', 'crap', 'ask', 'should', 'be', 'encouraging', 'even', 'helping', 'build', 'own', 'productions', 'Australia', 'not', 'rich', 'country', 'yet', 'think', 'produced', 'fine', 'film', 'positive', 'role', 'models', 'LOVED', 'movie', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'see', '2nd', '3rd', 'movie', 'made', 'good', 'better', 'first', 'one', 'However', 'tepid', 'reaction', 'snobby', 'northerners', 'not', 'likely', 'happen', 'am', 'really', 'sorry', 'love', 'country', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Hollywood', 'story', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'also', 'know', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'time', 'Tomorrow', 'suspect', 'was', 'blow', 'back', 'Too', 'bad', 'Tomorrow', 'deserved', 'better', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'would', 'encourage', 'watch', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'please', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'reviews', 'mine', 'dissuade', 'enjoying', 'as', 'much', 'did']",N/A

It's only refreshing to see the same story in a different setting.There's little originality - the kids come back to from camping to discover their folks missing and the town has been invaded. The enemy aren't readily identified. But that's itIt's got incredibly two-dimensional and somewhat annoying characters. And they do such stupid things.

Furthermore when chased by two light vehicles they don't use the truck to drive them off the road.Another is they decide to use a tanker truck to drive under part of a bridge and use the fuel in the truck as a bomb to blow the bridge up. Before they move into place two girls sit in the cabin remembering times before the invasion and are so engrossed in talking about boys they don't notice an enemy patrol moving up very slowly and otherwise easy to see.

1404820,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B004F88IGQ,MadMacs,"[7, 10]","Sadly, there was something here, a seed of potential that I so wished had a chance to grow into a scenario that no doubt lies in the realm of the possible. Particularly given Australia's proximal location to China - and the Dragon's seeming unstoppable expansion in the east.But this Aussie 'Red Dawn' failed on so many levels. It's difficult to categorize without doing a pile on.For starters, this would've been more enjoyable had the filmmakers' standards been set at ""less pretty"" in favor of ""more character"". The worst was Caitlin Stasey playing hardworking farm girl Ellie turned rebel insurgent. About as genuine and appropriate for the role as choosing Snooki at becoming a Green Beret.With those poor selections, from the get-go, the film had an air of a exaggerated falsehood. The entire cast made up of much-too-worldly, self-aware juniors wrecking the foundation of what I felt had the kernel for something quite good. And because that foundational element never takes hold, we're never fully invested in the movie's reality, in accepting the drama as depicted. Populated by thespian school hopefuls parading as actors, they're clearly not ready for the big screen.Again, highlighting Caitlin's performance as lead character Ellie, whose oscillations between overacting and underplayed made this retread all the more difficult to screen. Example: When her character and Corrie were in the playhouse. Yikes, what an absolutely terrible execution. I'm surprised she didn't put the back of her hand to her forehead and made some monstrously trite pronouncement. Just one of an incredible array of terrible cringe worthy scenes. The campsite scene at 1:13 in the film ... I can't even begin to start without writing a thesis on ham-fisted melodrama - both written and execution.One has to lay the primary blame at the feet of Director Stuart Beattie. It was his ineptitude that led these drama students down the merry path toward incompetence.A few more blatantly ridiculous bits that helped heave this into silliness:- We have these kids driving around on motorcycles, ATVs and SUVs - in the daytime no less. I'm not looking for fully authentic combat realism, but c'mon. I know what some of my fellow vets are thinking, ""Small town. Small force. Unexpected resistance."" Got that. But let's look at the flip side. Your company, a presumption given the approximately 100-150 enemy seen, is going to be tasked with subduing this backwater village. There has to be some intelligence. I mean even a basic satellite reconnaissance like Google Earth will reveal the general lay of the land, where the population is spread. And S2 should have a general idea of population count, types of housing, key civilian leadership, etc. It's not like these guys went in there completely blind. So yeah, once you have most of the populace under control, you immediately set out to cull the hold outs, the hideaways homebounds, etc. You never remain static. You're going to set-up a series of posts - fixed, fixed concealed, and roaming. No way a bunch of vehicles goes tearing around without one of your posts picking up either ambient noise or movement, most especially in a rural township. This isn't a city - sound travels far.- Why does everyone's makeup look so even throughout the movie? One of the reasons the original 'Red Dawn' worked was you could see how plain everyone was being virtually makeup free. And, most importantly, looked progressively worse as the film went on - which of course makes complete sense. I'm thinking specifically of Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey who were almost unrecognizable by the movie's final&eacute;. That all the females in 'Tomorrow' had their hair and makeup intact throughout the flick doomed this to a laughable unreality.- My favorite quote, ""You're bleeding!"". Yes, thank you Captain Obvious. The fact that a half dozen soldiers are firing fully-automatic assault weapons at you might, just might, incur some injury and blood loss. You know, with the shattered front shield and all. So let's tack on atrocious screenwriting to this flick.- Additionally, the clich&eacute;d trope of the 'checklist' - the working girl, the good girl, the portly (naturally) religious girl, the beauty, the likable average guy who turns out to be a coward (and will likely die a hero saving everyone in the upcoming films), the troublemaker, and of course, the token person of color - which I'm surprised wasn't an Aboriginal. Predictably derivative to a fault. People, all people, find friendship in a shared commodity. Whether that's work, an association, or even a hobby, there's always a common thread. What you don't have, not ever, are seven completely different people from wholly divergent backgrounds hanging out with one another. This formula only works with two basic movie constructs: Juries and certain kinds of natural disasters. Well, those and a Coca-Cola commercial.I understand this is the first of a trilogy. Yikes. If you hit rock bottom, I suppose things can only get better. The scary part - if I were a fan? I don't think they've hit the bottom yet. It'll be interesting to screen the newly rebooted 'Red Dawn' coming out later this year, if only for comparison's sake.Movie Note:- Director Beattie should be embarrassed and ashamed for not hiring one veteran from the Aussie SAS to help advise his production. I counted something like 50 people in the Effects Dept, another 30 or so in SFX, 30 in Sound, etc, etc. The one guy they desperately needed in this film, more than all that fluff and special effects, he ignored.It shows. It really shows.- If this type of film is what you're looking for, I recommend watching the tv series 'Jericho' instead.",1,"Inadequate And Ridiculous Aussie Retread, Laughably Unreal",1348876800,"09

Characters were a bit stereotypical. A little too much teen angst and inappropriate conversation during times when you should be paying attention. Really, do you need to talk about your love life as you're trying to blow up a bridge? Would you just stand there laughing while a herd of farm animals chase off your enemies? Isn't it like common sense that they just might shoot back??  Sometimes it seems that they're about to get serious, but then the movie takes a turn back to bubblegum teenie bopper problems.  It's not a bad movie but it's different from what a typical fan of this genre might assume.

Unlike in the (excellent) ""Red Dawn"" movie, these young people do not immediately pick up rifles and become guerrillas.  Instead, they grope towards the idea in a plausible and authentic way as the horror of their situation slowly becomes apparent to them.  But at last they realize that they have no real choice other than to defend the homeland that they come to realize that they love very much.The acting here is surprisingly good.

She's not really a bad actress - none of these kids are - but there is something so melodramtic in her delivery when she mentions 'the friends they have lost', that I could immediately see that we had entered tweenie fantasy land.Seven Australian teens go camping and return to find that their country has been invaded by mysterious 'coalition forces', and which look suspiciously like Chinese forces.  After a brief time hiding from the invaders (and horsing around in swimsuits), the teens eventually decide to fight back, guerrilla style, opting to destroy a bridge near their town which connects a major port to the interior of  the country.  Now, I'm not going to dissect the strategies and tactics the group uses, nor am I going to ridicule the ridiculous idea of the 'coalition forces'.  Honestly, I've seen a tremendous amount of bad films over my lifetime, and taking things like this with a grain of salt is part and parcel of bad science-fiction/apocalyptic/dystopian/WWIII dramas - what does drive me crazy about a film like TWTWB is its desperate infatuation for enhancing the emotional, melodramatic style of storytelling over any substantive point of view.  It exists in a narcissistic vacuum.That certainly doesn't mean it won't appeal to viewers who like that sort of thing.  In fact, if one subsists on an unregulated diet of this kind of storytelling, then TWTWB is probably going to look stylish and unique, due to both its cast and location.  At the very least, it will seem average.  For those who have enjoyed the TWILIGHT series, or such television melodramas as DAWSON'S CREEK and others, TOMORROW WHEN THE WAR BEGAN is highly recommended.  If those examples are not to your taste, then I would advise skipping TWTWB.Trust the Chief.",1,Red Dawn + Dawson's Creek = Poser Goofiness,1354492800,"12 3, 2012",2012,2015,"['time', 'when', 'fitting', 'speak', 'truth', 'power', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'hate', 'film', 'less', 'minute', 'when', 'attractive', 'young', 'Australian', 'girl', 'speaking', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'tries', 'prepare', 'flashback', 'story', 'follow', 'not', 'really', 'bad', 'actress', 'none', 'kids', 'are', 'something', 'so', 'melodramtic', 'delivery', 'when', 'friends', 'have', 'lost', 'could', 'immediately', 'see', 'had', 'entered', 'tweenie', 'fantasy', 'land.Seven', 'Australian', 'teens', 'go', 'camping', 'return', 'find', 'country', 'been', 'invaded', 'mysterious', ""'coalition"", 'forces', 'look', 'suspiciously', 'Chinese', 'forces', 'brief', 'time', 'hiding', 'invaders', 'horsing', 'around', 'swimsuits', 'teens', 'eventually', 'decide', 'fight', 'back', 'guerrilla', 'style', 'opting', 'destroy', 'bridge', 'town', 'major', 'port', 'interior', 'country', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'dissect', 'strategies', 'tactics', 'group', 'am', 'going', 'ridicule', 'ridiculous', 'idea', ""'coalition"", 'forces', 'Honestly', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'bad', 'films', 'lifetime', 'taking', 'things', 'grain', 'salt', 'part', 'parcel', 'bad', 'science-fiction/apocalyptic/dystopian/WWIII', 'dramas', 'what', 'drive', 'crazy', 'film', 'TWTWB', 'desperate', 'infatuation', 'enhancing', 'emotional', 'melodramatic', 'style', 'storytelling', 'substantive', 'point', 'view', 'narcissistic', 'vacuum.That', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'mean', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'viewers', 'who', 'like', 'sort', 'thing', 'fact', 'one', 'unregulated', 'diet', 'kind', 'storytelling', 'then', 'TWTWB', 'probably', 'going', 'look', 'stylish', 'unique', 'due', 'cast', 'location', 'very', 'least', 'will', 'seem', 'average', 'who', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'TWILIGHT', 'series', 'such', 'television', 'melodramas', 'DAWSON', 'CREEK', 'others', 'TOMORROW', 'WHEN', 'THE', 'WAR', 'BEGAN', 'highly', 'recommended', 'examples', 'are', 'not', 'taste', 'then', 'would', 'advise', 'skipping', 'TWTWB.Trust', 'Chief']",N/A

It is taken from the `teen novels' written by John Marsden and follows the book very closely. It is about a group of friends who decide to have a weekend getting back to nature;  that is sleeping under the stars and catching your own food etc. They borrow Ellie's dads' Land Rover and set off. Whilst they are there they see `a whole bunch' of military aircraft passing over head but have no idea of the significance. Ellie is the charismatic female alpha figure played brilliantly by Caitlin Stasey.On their return they find animals dead, places abandoned and everybody missing. That is when the really start to worry. After hunting around they discover that the entire town of Wirawee, is being held prisoner at the Show Ground. They slowly piece together what has happened and realise that an unnamed country of `coalition' forces has invaded Australia to exploit its resources. The kids have no military training, and few weapons, and a lot of growing up to do. Despite all of that they decide they have to fight back.This has been criticised for being a poor take on `Red Dawn' and at first I thought so too, but it is actually quite original in that it is not that black and white. The main male positive character is Asian Chris Pung playing LeeTakkon. Yet the invaders seem to be Oriental so who is the enemy? A point on the production they deliberately use different languages and then mix them up so you are not able to work out who the invaders are. We also have issues of cowardice, religious ethics, vegemite and the right use of make up.The CGI is excellent, the scenery is stunning and the whole thing has a confidence in its own ability, and it does not fail to deliver. There are a couple of plot holes, but they are so minor that they do not take away from the enjoyment. Director and co-screenplay writer Stuart Beattie has done himself proud in this adaptation and the pacing is just right too. I wanted it to go on a while longer when it ended and as this lasts for 103 minutes I thought that was quite some achievement.This was the highest grossing film in Australia for 2010, bringing in $13 million, which is not a bad effort at all. On the back of that they are going to make two, yes two sequels. So not long to wait for the next instalment, and if it is half as good as this, then it will have been well worth the wait.",4,"""It's Time To Go To War!""",1320278400,"11 3, 2011",2011,2447,"['box', 'office', 'smash', 'took', 'Australia', 'storm', 'rest', 'world', 'catching', 'up', 'taken', 'teen', 'novels', 'written', 'John', 'Marsden', 'book', 'very', 'closely', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'decide', 'have', 'weekend', 'getting', 'back', 'nature', 'sleeping', 'stars', 'catching', 'own', 'food', 'etc', 'borrow', 'Ellie', 'dads', 'Land', 'Rover', 'set', 'off', 'are', 'there', 'see', 'whole', 'bunch', 'military', 'aircraft', 'passing', 'head', 'have', 'idea', 'significance', 'Ellie', 'charismatic', 'female', 'alpha', 'figure', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Caitlin', 'Stasey.On', 'return', 'find', 'animals', 'dead', 'places', 'abandoned', 'everybody', 'missing', 'when', 'really', 'start', 'worry', 'hunting', 'discover', 'entire', 'town', 'Wirawee', 'being', 'held', 'prisoner', 'Show', 'Ground', 'slowly', 'piece', 'together', 'what', 'happened', 'realise', 'unnamed', 'country', 'coalition', 'forces', 'invaded', 'Australia', 'exploit', 'resources', 'kids', 'have', 'military', 'training', 'few', 'weapons', 'lot', 'growing', 'up', 'do', 'decide', 'have', 'fight', 'back.This', 'been', 'criticised', 'being', 'poor', 'take', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'first', 'thought', 'so', 'too', 'actually', 'quite', 'original', 'not', 'black', 'white', 'main', 'male', 'positive', 'character', 'Asian', 'Chris', 'Pung', 'playing', 'LeeTakkon', 'invaders', 'seem', 'be', 'Oriental', 'who', 'enemy', 'point', 'production', 'deliberately', 'use', 'different', 'languages', 'then', 'mix', 'up', 'so', 'are', 'not', 'able', 'work', 'out', 'who', 'invaders', 'are', 'also', 'have', 'issues', 'cowardice', 'religious', 'ethics', 'vegemite', 'right', 'use', 'make', 'up.The', 'CGI', 'excellent', 'scenery', 'stunning', 'whole', 'thing', 'confidence', 'own', 'ability', 'not', 'fail', 'deliver', 'are', 'couple', 'plot', 'holes', 'are', 'so', 'minor', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'enjoyment', 'Director', 'co-screenplay', 'writer', 'Stuart', 'Beattie', 'done', 'proud', 'adaptation', 'pacing', 'just', 'right', 'too', 'wanted', 'go', 'while', 'longer', 'when', 'ended', '103', 'minutes', 'thought', 'was', 'quite', 'achievement.This', 'was', 'highest', 'grossing', 'film', 'Australia', '2010', 'bringing', '13', 'million', 'not', 'bad', 'effort', 'back', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'two', 'yes', 'two', 'sequels', 'So', 'not', 'long', 'wait', 'next', 'instalment', 'half', 'as', 'good', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'wait']",N/A
