1320994,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B003498RRC,barry,"[6, 6]","Thank you MPI Home Theater for your dedication to all that is Lucy.  Each release that you issue is handled with loving care and a gift to all us Lucy fans.  LUCY CALLS THE PRESIDENT is one of the many specials Lucy did after ending HERE'S LUCY.  It is infamous for many reasons.  Some sad, most importantly that Lucy's mother Deedee had just passed away.  Throughout Lucy's entire career she had never missed a single taping and the bond between these two was strong.  How bittersweet and sad it must have been for Lucy to go forward but Lucy was a trooper and this special provides some of the best magic of her entire career.The plot of Lucy phoning the president and then the announcement that he would be stopping by her house is a simple premise for some hilarious comedic stunts as only Lucille Ball could provide.  Lucy was always loyal to fellow actors she liked to work with and this special was indeed special for it was a final reunion that brought them all together.  We get Mary Wickes, Mary Jane Croft, Gale Gordon but most importantly the final television reunion of Lucille and Vivian Vance.  None of their magic chemistry had been lost and each scene sparked with reminders of all the laughs these two have provided us.  And this special continues those laughs nonstop.  The simple use of potato salad and a cake provides the most hilarious moments of the special.  I sat through this and laughed from beginning to end and remembered watching it when it first aired in 1977.  I had been 16.  Lucy was the master and her comedic timing was still fully intact.  This special is a must for all Lucy fans as well as fans of comedy history.The bonus features here are worth the price of admission in itself.  They actually had much rehearsal footage and we got to see Lucy and cast in rehearsal which is a very rare treat.  The scenes would then be shown next to the footage that actually aired.  Some great moments.  Then we have Lucille Ball guest starring on The Johnny Carson Show.  The entire interview is shown and it is always a unique insight and gift to see how different Lucille Ball was from the character Lucy.  Then we have an interview with James E. Brodhead.  The segment is called WORKING WITH LUCY.  This segment was priceless for me.  He had met Lucy working on MAME and he describes his interactions with her on the set in hilarious detail.  She bacame so impressed with him that he became a constant player on HERE'S LUCY.  He is also in this special as the mayor.  Many actors have said that Lucille Ball was a very difficult task master to work with and he speaks on this at length.  She was always direct but was always looking for the best.  The MAME story shows true insight into Lucille Ball as a person.  This segment provided me with Lucy knowledge I did not know and that is hard to do.  To hear of her loyalty and how she worked her craft was mezmerizing.We also get a segment from the brief radio show TALKING WITH LUCY where she interviews Steve Allen.  So much Lucy history here.  This special is not watching a classic actress out of her prime but instead shows how even as she aged Lucy always remained the Queen of Comedy with timing, class and grace that was impeccable and priceless.  I can't say enough.  Purchase and enjoy.",5,Great special and awesome bonus features,1270598400,"04 7, 2010",2010,3276,"['Thank', 'MPI', 'Home', 'Theater', 'dedication', 'Lucy', 'release', 'issue', 'handled', 'loving', 'care', 'gift', 'Lucy', 'fans', 'LUCY', 'CALLS', 'THE', 'PRESIDENT', 'one', 'many', 'specials', 'Lucy', 'did', 'ending', 'HERE', 'LUCY', 'infamous', 'many', 'reasons', 'sad', 'most', 'importantly', 'Lucy', 'mother', 'Deedee', 'had', 'just', 'passed', 'away', 'Throughout', 'Lucy', 'entire', 'career', 'had', 'never', 'missed', 'single', 'taping', 'bond', 'two', 'was', 'strong', 'How', 'bittersweet', 'sad', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'Lucy', 'go', 'forward', 'Lucy', 'was', 'trooper', 'special', 'best', 'magic', 'entire', 'career.The', 'plot', 'Lucy', 'phoning', 'president', 'then', 'announcement', 'would', 'be', 'stopping', 'house', 'simple', 'premise', 'hilarious', 'comedic', 'stunts', 'only', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'could', 'provide', 'Lucy', 'was', 'always', 'loyal', 'fellow', 'actors', 'liked', 'work', 'special', 'was', 'indeed', 'special', 'was', 'final', 'reunion', 'brought', 'together', 'get', 'Mary', 'Wickes', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Croft', 'Gale', 'Gordon', 'most', 'importantly', 'final', 'television', 'reunion', 'Lucille', 'Vivian', 'Vance', 'None', 'magic', 'chemistry', 'had', 'been', 'lost', 'scene', 'sparked', 'reminders', 'laughs', 'two', 'have', 'provided', 'special', 'laughs', 'nonstop', 'simple', 'use', 'potato', 'salad', 'cake', 'most', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'special', 'sat', 'laughed', 'beginning', 'end', 'remembered', 'watching', 'when', 'first', 'aired', '1977', 'had', 'been', '16', 'Lucy', 'was', 'master', 'comedic', 'timing', 'was', 'still', 'fully', 'intact', 'special', 'must', 'Lucy', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'fans', 'comedy', 'history.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'here', 'are', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'actually', 'had', 'much', 'rehearsal', 'footage', 'got', 'see', 'Lucy', 'cast', 'rehearsal', 'very', 'rare', 'treat', 'scenes', 'would', 'then', 'be', 'shown', 'next', 'footage', 'actually', 'aired', 'great', 'moments', 'Then', 'have', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'guest', 'starring', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'Show', 'entire', 'interview', 'shown', 'always', 'unique', 'insight', 'gift', 'see', 'how', 'different', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'was', 'character', 'Lucy', 'Then', 'have', 'interview', 'James', 'E.', 'Brodhead', 'segment', 'called', 'WORKING', 'WITH', 'LUCY', 'segment', 'was', 'priceless', 'had', 'met', 'Lucy', 'working', 'MAME', 'interactions', 'set', 'hilarious', 'detail', 'bacame', 'so', 'impressed', 'became', 'constant', 'player', 'HERE', 'LUCY', 'also', 'special', 'mayor', 'Many', 'actors', 'have', 'said', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'was', 'very', 'difficult', 'task', 'master', 'work', 'length', 'was', 'always', 'direct', 'was', 'always', 'looking', 'best', 'MAME', 'story', 'shows', 'true', 'insight', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'person', 'segment', 'provided', 'Lucy', 'knowledge', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'hard', 'do', 'hear', 'loyalty', 'how', 'worked', 'craft', 'was', 'mezmerizing.We', 'also', 'get', 'segment', 'brief', 'radio', 'show', 'TALKING', 'WITH', 'LUCY', 'where', 'Steve', 'Allen', 'So', 'much', 'Lucy', 'history', 'here', 'special', 'not', 'watching', 'classic', 'actress', 'prime', 'instead', 'how', 'even', 'aged', 'Lucy', 'always', 'remained', 'Queen', 'Comedy', 'timing', 'class', 'grace', 'was', 'impeccable', 'priceless', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'Purchase', 'enjoy']",N/A

1320996,AKTQOJG1NFHM1,B003498RRC,"Charles D. Blanchard ""Novelist""","[1, 1]","How would it feel if suddenly by making a simple call to the White House, you actually got through and spoke with the President and if that wasn't enough, he invites himself and his family to dinner at your home? That is the heavenly spun premise that is the basis for Lucille Ball's 1977 show, which after seeing it only once when it aired thirty years ago, and to finally see it again, just reinforces my belief that the special blend of friendship and chemistry and made the Lucy shows so unique no longer exists in TV today. Seeing it again is a step back in time. Remember it was in the seventies and the great talents of the 1950s who revolutionzed television were getting on in years but the creativity never left, it just went right along with the times and perhaps was never really appreciated in the seventies as it had been in the fifties.  Perhaps its nostalgic. Perhaps there is a sense of passing as this type of show no longer exists. But, what made Lucille Ball so loved and admired was not the fact that she was particularly funny in the same sense as Carol Burnett for example, or any of the other shows at the time since thay were all very different. But  Lucille Ball had her best co-stars with whom she worked with for years and would always bring back again whenever the opportunity arose and the creative team of writers including Bob Carroll and Madelyn Davis, who created I love Lucy. These were special friendships that carried over into their work and that is the special touch of Lucille Ball's success. And of course this included Vivian Vance, Gale Gordon, and the bubbly Mary Jane Croft. Without them, the success of the Lucille Ball Shows would not have been the same. When you see the rare taped dress rehearsals that are included in the DVD, you see a real pro at work. Lucy gets frustrated sometimes when at the end of a take she says, ""No one yells cut, here."" But she just keeps going. Vivian Vance, bless her heart. This was the last time the two women would work together. This DVD is a real gem and I applaud MPI for doing such a great job, especially by including the dress rehearsalsCharles Blanchardauthor of Mourning Doves After The Fire",5,Guess Who's Coming To Dinner?,1304726400,"05 7, 2011",2011,2181,"['How', 'would', 'feel', 'suddenly', 'making', 'simple', 'call', 'White', 'House', 'actually', 'got', 'spoke', 'President', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'family', 'dinner', 'home', 'heavenly', 'spun', 'premise', 'basis', 'Lucille', 'Ball', '1977', 'show', 'seeing', 'only', 'once', 'when', 'aired', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'finally', 'see', 'again', 'just', 'reinforces', 'belief', 'special', 'blend', 'friendship', 'chemistry', 'made', 'Lucy', 'shows', 'so', 'unique', 'no', 'longer', 'TV', 'today', 'Seeing', 'again', 'step', 'back', 'time', 'Remember', 'was', 'seventies', 'great', 'talents', '1950s', 'who', 'revolutionzed', 'television', 'were', 'getting', 'years', 'creativity', 'never', 'left', 'just', 'went', 'right', 'times', 'perhaps', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'appreciated', 'seventies', 'had', 'been', 'fifties', 'Perhaps', 'nostalgic', 'Perhaps', 'sense', 'passing', 'type', 'show', 'no', 'longer', 'what', 'made', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'so', 'loved', 'admired', 'was', 'not', 'fact', 'was', 'particularly', 'funny', 'same', 'sense', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'example', 'other', 'shows', 'time', 'thay', 'were', 'very', 'different', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'had', 'best', 'co-stars', 'whom', 'worked', 'years', 'would', 'always', 'bring', 'back', 'again', 'opportunity', 'arose', 'creative', 'team', 'writers', 'including', 'Bob', 'Carroll', 'Madelyn', 'Davis', 'who', 'created', 'love', 'Lucy', 'were', 'special', 'friendships', 'carried', 'work', 'special', 'touch', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'success', 'course', 'included', 'Vivian', 'Vance', 'Gale', 'Gordon', 'bubbly', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Croft', 'success', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'Shows', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'same', 'When', 'see', 'rare', 'taped', 'dress', 'rehearsals', 'are', 'included', 'DVD', 'see', 'real', 'pro', 'work', 'Lucy', 'frustrated', 'sometimes', 'when', 'end', 'take', 'one', 'cut', 'here', 'just', 'going', 'Vivian', 'Vance', 'bless', 'heart', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'two', 'women', 'would', 'work', 'together', 'DVD', 'real', 'gem', 'applaud', 'MPI', 'doing', 'such', 'great', 'job', 'especially', 'including', 'dress', 'Blanchardauthor', 'Mourning', 'Doves', 'Fire']",N/A

Gale Gordon joins the mix, along with a few new co-stars for Lucy, such as Ed McMahon, who plays one of Lucy's very rare on-screen husbands after Desi Arnaz.  The plot itself is clever enough, but the jokes seem spread out a little too thin throughout the show.  The actors may be aging and, especially in the case of Vivian, in noticeably bad health, but their love of their art and their desire to put on a show shine through all the same.

Lucy Calls The President is a one hour special that was originally aired on November 21, 1977 on CBS. It starred Lucille Ball, Vivian Vance, Gale Gordon, Mary Jane Croft, Mary Wickes (all from The Lucy Show) along with Ed McMahon, Steve Allen, Lillian Carter (President Jimmy Carter's mother) and others.Lucy plays Lucy Whittaker from Indiana, who calls in to President Jimmy Carter's weekly speak to the President phone service for the public, so she can bring up a topic of local importance. President Carter tells Lucy he'll discuss her local issues with her in person, as he will be in her area soon. Later plans change so the President will actually be at Lucy's house to have dinner with her! Of course, everyone who has ever known Lucy in her life, just has to be invited to this special dinner for President Carter, so this will be some dinner Lucy has to prepare for such a large crowd!With 5 of The Lucy Show's cast re-united for this special, it would sadly turn out to be their last time together. Vivian Vance had been fighting breast cancer for a while undergoing chemotherapy, when she suffered a stroke just a few months before the special started filming. This stroke left Vivian's left side of her face partially paralyzed, but she unbelievably still went on filming this special with Lucy. In July of 1977, just 4 months before filming, Lucy lost her beloved mother DeDe Ball. DeDe never missed a show of Lucy's as she was always in the audience, through every episode of I Love Lucy, The Lucy Show, Here's Lucy and all her television specials. This was the first time Lucy would do a show without her wonderful supportive mother in the audience. They said Lucy was visibly distraught and upset with the absence of her mother and that it shows in her acting and movements in the show.Sadly, Vivian Vance lost her battle with cancer only a year and a half later and passed away on August 17, 1979. Vivian's health and stroke prevented her from working with her beloved television partner ever again, so this is the last time Vivian and Lucy ever worked together. MPI says they are including the following bonus materials along with this great special: Never before seen rehearsal footage of Lucy and the cast, a featurette with guest star James E. Brodhead, Lucy on the Tonight Show in 1969 and more rare Lucy footage.I can't express my gratitude to MPI enough for bringing these long lost treasures to us once again since their premiere in 1977! I can't wait until Lucy Calls The President's dvd is released on April 6, 2010! On April 27th, 2010 I Love Lucy: The Movie dvd is being released also and we have a bit of a wait from CBS to release The Lucy Show Season 2 dvd on July 13,2010 and The Lucy Show Season 3 dvd on October 12, 2010! I have been keeping in contact with CBS for all the news on The Lucy Shows dvd releases. CBS said they will base future releases on sales, so please all you Lucy fans- keep buying and CBS and MPI will keep releasing! CBS has pushed the release dates farther away only because of the pristine clean up they are doing on The Lucy Show! The job they did on The Lucy Show Season 1 was beyond perfect!
