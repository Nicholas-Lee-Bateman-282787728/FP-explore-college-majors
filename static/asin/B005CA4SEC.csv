I expected a 2011 movie to be worthy of watching, this movie was not  worthy of my time. It had good special effects compare to B movies. However there were times when you could see how cheap it was. In example when school was burning, the fire looked so bad. The werewolf costume looked so cheap actually, especially the legs. When 2 werewolves collapsed, you could well see that there is no life captured in those costumes. There was either one of actors present or none at all. Not until the next scene. I don't think there is really any point in writing more about the movie itself, it was so boring to watch. Not an epic failure, but it's bad. I would NOT consider it to be another Howling movie.

The story unfolds during the main character's last days as a senior classman; its darkly dramatic climax occurs simultaneous to a rain-soaked outdoor nighttime graduation ceremony.The film touches all the clich&eacute;d bases of modern youth-oriented cinema. There's major destruction of property, several sexual encounters (including an unfulfilled come-on to the boy from his wolfpack leader mom), lots of expletive-laced dialogue, overly loud music and much mayhem, all filmed with often shaky handheld cameras.

The quality is alot better than the other howling movies that's for sure. And Howling New moon Rising looked like a film student project which was the last one before this. The only other ones really worth watching are parts 1 and 2 but they are terribly outdated. So I have to be very fair in this review, yes this is a revelation in the series. It did resurrect the cinematography and quality of the series. But is this a great movie ?  Its just ok in my opinion. The Werewolf transformation could have been alot better for sure. Especially with today's technology and special fx artist. If you look at the very first film the transformation was better than the new one. And that was 20 years ago so that's pretty pathetic. These werewolves just morphed into a wolf in like 30 seconds ? Also the girl character was useless they built mystery around her when it wasn't necessary.

Like many others that have come before it, I figured it'd be a boring retread of something I'd seen before. Except for the very first movie, every last Howling movie reeked. Thankfully, The Howling Reborn turned out to be a pretty decent movie despite its' apparent low-budget.The story centers around Will Kidman(your average everyday kid) whose infatutation with a gorgeous classmate starts to trigger animal instincts. When a mysterious woman with a deep secret re-enters his life, he learns that he is heir(the alpha-male as it were) to a powerful line of werewolves. It's then that he is faced with making a choice..either turning against his own or giving into his primal instincts. Take one wild guess what choice he makes. You'd be surprised.I believe that, given the right budget, this could've been a more powerful reboot of the franchise. The story was there and the acting was solid. It had a killer soundtrack. There was certainly believable chemistry there with the cast. Not only that but the movie is totally unrelated to the previous films in the series. To me, that's definitely a plus.Despite what other reviewers out there are saying about the movie, don't believe everything you read. As I said before, it's a pretty decent movie and is a good alternative to other teenage drivel out there(again, even though it has a low-budget). It'd be cool if this story continued. Course, considering it is a direct-to-DVD movie, I don't see it happening.Give this one a chance, you might end up liking it.

Tweens everywhere will have a new werewolf film to add to their collection in THE HOWLING REBORN, the eighth entry into the series and the newest sequel following the disastrous NEW MOON RISING from 1995. Life is difficult enough for Will Kidman between finishing his math homework and fending off high school bullies, but things become even hairier when he learns that he is the last in the bloodline of a powerful pack of werewolves. Now, he must choose to fight his killer instinct to protect the girl he loves or embrace his inner beast to run with the pack! While it is far from perfect, THE HOWLING REBORN is sure to become a guilty pleasure amongst werewolf fans after it ramps up the teen drama with a surprising amount of violence and sexuality. Joe Nimziki's script is riddled with plot holes and goofy dialog, but he maintains a steady stream of action that includes some of the best creature effects since the original.

Unfortunately, that level is bargain basement.I knew I was in trouble when the lead actor (Landon Liboiron) showed up looking suspiciously like Harry Potter....lost in a Twilight film!The plot has absolutely nothing to do with any of the previous Howling films, suggesting that the title was slapped on simply to cash in on their reputation as a brand.  In this film, the plot revolves around a boy's acceptance of who/what he is and how he deals with that knowledge once he learns of his true nature as an instant werewolf (apparently, it pops up with puberty?).  Oh yeah, there's also a plot to overthrow the world.Worst aspect of this film, the never ending drone of a narration by Landon Liboriron, I stopped listening after awhile, my mind began to wander.  I can only handle just so much whining.As a whole, this film is inconsistent in tone and direction; characters were constantly in flux, changing personalities in the blink of an eye and for no apparent reason.

SKIP IT!I wouldn't call it a remake.  This contemporized franchise reboot chronicles the ""coming of adulthood"" of high school senior Will (Landon Liboiron).  Will has a thing for Eliana (Lindsey Shaw), one of his classmates that refers to her clique as a ""pack.""  Much to his surprise, she invites him to party where he is drugged, shares some time with Eliana and thinks he sees a werewolf.After the ""attack"" Will turns to his best friend and horror trivia expert to learn about werewolves.  Meanwhile Will notices that he doesn't seem to need his prescription glasses anymore (like in Wolf), he's stronger and more assertive, his wounds heal before his eyes and he spends more time with Eliana.  Their relationship is really coming along.  This flick focuses more on the emotions, self-discovery  and Will's relationship with Eliana than werewolves.  Speaking as a 30-something adult, this movie is pretty lame.Kay (Ivana Milicevic) is the mother of a fellow student. She puts the moves on Will's dad and shifts from kind-hearted and mild-mannered to sultry.  But there's something special about Kay.  She has a special interest in Will and she knows something special about him--whereas there is nothing special about this movie.Lots of people die; we don't see it happen.  There are lots of werewolves; we don't see them.  I mean, we get a glimpse and the costume/make-up were okay despite their long ugly rat tails.  But the werewolf screen time was very little until the last 20 minutes.Transformation is much easier nowadays with CGI.  Spinal vertebrae pulsate before pushing out the skin.  But after the first transformation they were reduced to hideously simplified instantaneous CGI morphs without stages, pain, etc.  This flick, while awful, keeps in line with franchise tradition and includes a mid-coitus transformation scene.  With the exception of Howling II: Your Sister is a Werewolf (1985), these sex scenes always include a female werewolf and a regular guy who's in for a big surprise.The only thing this movie does well is reinforce the admonishing trend that the newer a ""Howling"" movie is the less advisable it is to watch.",1,Just when I thought the world was done with sparkly vampires...another teeny bopper high school relationship movie!,1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,2310,"['Just', 'when', 'thought', 'world', 'was', 'done', 'sparkly', 'vampires', 'stumbled', 'teeny', 'bopper', 'high', 'school', 'relationship', 'movie', 'masquerading', 'horror', 'SKIP', 'IT', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'remake', 'contemporized', 'franchise', 'reboot', 'coming', 'adulthood', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'Will', 'Landon', 'Liboiron', 'Will', 'thing', 'Eliana', 'Lindsey', 'Shaw', 'one', 'classmates', 'refers', 'clique', 'pack', 'Much', 'surprise', 'party', 'where', 'drugged', 'shares', 'time', 'Eliana', 'werewolf.After', 'attack', 'Will', 'best', 'friend', 'horror', 'trivia', 'expert', 'learn', 'werewolves', 'Meanwhile', 'Will', ""n't"", 'seem', 'need', 'prescription', 'glasses', 'anymore', 'Wolf', 'stronger', 'more', 'assertive', 'wounds', 'heal', 'eyes', 'more', 'time', 'Eliana', 'relationship', 'really', 'coming', 'along', 'flick', 'more', 'emotions', 'self-discovery', 'Will', 'relationship', 'Eliana', 'werewolves', 'Speaking', '30-something', 'adult', 'movie', 'pretty', 'lame.Kay', 'Ivana', 'Milicevic', 'mother', 'fellow', 'student', 'moves', 'Will', 'dad', 'shifts', 'kind-hearted', 'mild-mannered', 'sultry', 'something', 'special', 'Kay', 'special', 'interest', 'Will', 'something', 'special', 'nothing', 'special', 'movie.Lots', 'people', 'die', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'happen', 'are', 'lots', 'werewolves', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'mean', 'get', 'glimpse', 'costume/make-up', 'were', 'okay', 'long', 'ugly', 'rat', 'tails', 'werewolf', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'last', '20', 'minutes.Transformation', 'much', 'easier', 'nowadays', 'CGI', 'Spinal', 'vertebrae', 'pulsate', 'pushing', 'out', 'skin', 'first', 'transformation', 'were', 'reduced', 'hideously', 'simplified', 'instantaneous', 'CGI', 'morphs', 'stages', 'pain', 'etc', 'flick', 'awful', 'keeps', 'line', 'franchise', 'tradition', 'mid-coitus', 'transformation', 'scene', 'exception', 'Howling', 'II', 'Sister', 'Werewolf', '1985', 'sex', 'scenes', 'always', 'include', 'female', 'werewolf', 'regular', 'guy', 'who', 'big', 'surprise.The', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'well', 'reinforce', 'admonishing', 'trend', 'newer', 'Howling', 'movie', 'less', 'advisable', 'watch']",N/A

1453672,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005CA4SEC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[9, 10]","When the original ""The Howling"" debuted in 1981, while successful enough, it certainly wasn't a huge commercial or critical smash on arrival. But through time and the video market, Joe Dante's werewolf conception started to gain traction and fit into a monster movie niche that few other pictures at the time were filling. An apt genre comparison of the same era would be the stellar (and much better) ""An American Werewolf in London."" Neither film reinvented horror conventions, but both employed state-of-the art effects and make-up to modernize the tales for a new audience (American Werewolf won a 1981 Make-up Oscar). As ""The Howling"" eventually came to be embraced as a minor classic of werewolf lore, it spawned a series of direct-to-DVD sequels (most in name only). Really, if you have seen ANY of them--they leave a lot to be desired! I say all this to preface my comments about ""The Howling Reborn"" (a title eerily reminiscent of 1991's ""Howling V: The Rebirth""). There's nothing wrong in referencing a classic, but the movie landscape has changed considerably since the original film. Now werewolves are all over television, books, and movies and it's much harder to bring something new to the party.Unfortunately, this is a real case of ""I've seen it all before, and much much better!"" The movie kicks right off with a werewolf attack (although the culprit is unseen) as a pregnant woman in what looks like a bad disguise is mauled. The film advances through time, and now the unborn fetus is about to graduate from high school. This isn't any ordinary high school, though. It seems to be a private facility with a fortress like security system--seriously, it's pretty spectacular to see this ancient building with stained glass windows go into a modern lockdown mode any prison would envy. Several things must be accepted to move the plot along. Despite having attended the same classes for years, the plot requires various characters to be complete strangers (even the principle is clueless about his class of seniors). Although the school is bustling with activity, it can also be completely deserted when necessary. Even gunshots, blood stains, bodies, or missing students don't arouse investigation during the school day! So much for advanced security.Our hero (Landon Liboiron of the new show Terra Nova) is one of those movie geeks who seems to be a misfit because he wears glasses (very Harry Potter, in fact). His love for an enigmatic tough girl reaches fruition as she invites him to an after hours party where he is almost attacked. But things start to get even more suspicious. Is there a werewolf clan? What are their designs on our young hero? And is there any escape? And if about 100 people went missing, would anyone notice? On the last day of school, the building goes into full lockdown (despite the fact that graduation is being held--without parents--right outside) trapping all the principle players in for a series of showdowns. The werewolf effects aren't especially notable and are used very sparsely to boot. It's all incredibly silly and underwhelming. There are just too many werewolf choices available to make this rather inept attempt of any interest. Even suspending all logic (which you have to do throughout) , this simply doesn't offer any originality or any genuine thrills. KGHarris, 10/11.",1,Reborn? More Like Stillborn.

Who knows whether that will happen or not? Since everyone seems to be perceiving this as a Twilight knock off. This twi-hater bandwagon is so aggressive that anything resembling it, no matter how remote, is guilty by association. Since in this era, how you feel about a mere work of fiction, is a valid way to judge and condemn someone. Why is that? Perhaps the main character of Will Kidman offers some insight into that when he says. ""My generation, we're not about commitments and relationships, we're about hooking up. It's like somewhere along the way we were lead to believe that knowing too much about a partner makes love less exciting. We were led to believe wrong."" I guess people object to the implication that emotional intimacy has anything to do with the physical act of sex. As for the movie itself, it's trying to capture the essence of the original movie, which was far more sophisticated than the mindless B-Grade schlock of the first six sequels. Which is what I appreciate about this movie, but what I appreciate is obviously a complete waste on most present day horror fans based upon other reviews. Still, you can sense there is a lot more story between the scenes that we do not see on screen. I really would have liked to have seen what a bit more development could have done for this movie. Then again, maybe they were waiting to deal with those unanswered questions in future sequels. They obviously set it up for one. I got to say one last thing, Lindsey Shaw and Ivana Milicevic, are way sexy. It is what got me to watch the film three times, and eventually see the film for what it is.

1453675,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005CA4SEC,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","I guess when you get to a certain number of sequels you have to omit the number and add something new...like reborn. As a fan of the original THE HOWLING, I was always disappointed in the sequels. While the original had a limited budget, it was filled with something original, a new take on the whole werewolf story. But the rest lacked even the small budget of the first and the only thing worthwhile in any was the laugh inducing marsupial werewolf in the third one. Or would that be were-kangaroo?Well it's been a few years and the series died down a bit. Chances are the newest group of horror film lovers aren't old enough to remember the original or haven't seen it. So it was time to dust off the old and make it new. Or at least give it a shot.Will Kidman is a troubled teen. He's about to graduate and has the hots for the new girl in school, Eliana, who also happens to be dating the school tough guy. Which isn't a good thing for will since he's the designated school geek. But opposites attract and sparks fly between them.When they meet at a secretive party together, weird things begin to happen. Like Will noticing several new kids from the school hanging around in a sort of...pack? When it seems he's been drugged, Will ends up seeing all sorts of things.As the days progress Will senses something else is different. He never had the chance to know his mother, an artist we saw killed while she was pregnant with him during the films opening sequence. But some link between his mother and what's going on with him now will turn up and explain why he's changing. You got it, somewhere along the line Will has werewolf blood in his veins.Will's attraction to Eliana grows and with it the viewer begins to wonder if she isn't tied into the whole thing. Could it be that she's the member of a clan of werewolves sent to recruit Will? Or perhaps it was her group that saw to the demise of Will's mother? Only time will tell.This movie is perhaps not the worst film in this series but it works at it. It offers few scares and fewer fresh and original scenes than most. And the werewolf costumes seem like costumes. I'm not quite certain yet if that's the fault of the make up man at work here or the cinematographer who allowed them to appear like suits. In any event it ruins the effect of a real live werewolf captured on screen.The story is weak and rarely finds a reason for the viewer to care about anyone from the hero to the villain. Instead we get the usual back story and a twist that seems unoriginal. I'll say it again, while this isn't the worst of the series or the worst werewolf movie, it does leave you wanting to watch one that is done better like perhaps the first in the series. But if the rest of the series have been checked out when you go looking and this is left? It might be worth giving it a look.",2,MORE A HOOT THAN A HOWL,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,2834,"['guess', 'when', 'get', 'certain', 'number', 'sequels', 'have', 'omit', 'number', 'add', 'something', 'new', 'reborn', 'fan', 'original', 'THE', 'HOWLING', 'was', 'always', 'disappointed', 'sequels', 'original', 'had', 'limited', 'budget', 'was', 'filled', 'something', 'original', 'new', 'take', 'whole', 'werewolf', 'story', 'rest', 'lacked', 'even', 'small', 'budget', 'first', 'only', 'thing', 'worthwhile', 'was', 'laugh', 'inducing', 'marsupial', 'werewolf', 'third', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'were-kangaroo', 'been', 'few', 'years', 'series', 'died', 'bit', 'Chances', 'are', 'newest', 'group', 'horror', 'film', 'lovers', 'are', ""n't"", 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'original', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'was', 'time', 'dust', 'off', 'old', 'make', 'new', 'least', 'give', 'shot.Will', 'Kidman', 'troubled', 'teen', 'graduate', 'hots', 'new', 'girl', 'school', 'Eliana', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'dating', 'school', 'tough', 'guy', 'Which', ""n't"", 'good', 'thing', 'will', 'designated', 'school', 'geek', 'attract', 'fly', 'them.When', 'meet', 'secretive', 'party', 'together', 'weird', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'Will', 'noticing', 'several', 'new', 'kids', 'school', 'hanging', 'around', 'sort', 'pack', 'When', 'been', 'drugged', 'Will', 'up', 'seeing', 'sorts', 'things.As', 'days', 'progress', 'Will', 'something', 'else', 'different', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'know', 'mother', 'artist', 'saw', 'killed', 'was', 'pregnant', 'films', 'opening', 'sequence', 'link', 'mother', 'what', 'going', 'now', 'will', 'turn', 'up', 'explain', 'why', 'changing', 'got', 'somewhere', 'line', 'Will', 'werewolf', 'blood', 'veins.Will', 'attraction', 'Eliana', 'grows', 'viewer', 'wonder', ""n't"", 'tied', 'whole', 'thing', 'Could', 'be', 'member', 'clan', 'werewolves', 'sent', 'recruit', 'Will', 'perhaps', 'was', 'group', 'saw', 'demise', 'Will', 'mother', 'Only', 'time', 'will', 'tell.This', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'not', 'worst', 'film', 'series', 'few', 'scares', 'fewer', 'fresh', 'original', 'scenes', 'most', 'werewolf', 'seem', 'costumes', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'certain', 'yet', 'fault', 'make', 'up', 'man', 'work', 'here', 'cinematographer', 'who', 'allowed', 'appear', 'suits', 'event', 'effect', 'real', 'live', 'werewolf', 'captured', 'screen.The', 'story', 'weak', 'rarely', 'reason', 'viewer', 'care', 'anyone', 'hero', 'villain', 'Instead', 'get', 'usual', 'back', 'story', 'twist', 'unoriginal', ""'ll"", 'say', 'again', ""n't"", 'worst', 'series', 'worst', 'werewolf', 'movie', 'leave', 'wanting', 'watch', 'one', 'done', 'better', 'perhaps', 'first', 'series', 'rest', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'checked', 'out', 'when', 'go', 'looking', 'left', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'giving', 'look']",N/A

His mother then comes for him and trys to get him to come with the pack. The one thing i do not understand about this movie is why his mother wants him back. The impression that i got was that in the film his mother seems to be very jealous of his girlfriend and when she finally turns on him she tells him that she should have aborted him he then replies why because your boy likes he girlfriend better then mommy. This then sends her in a rage and starts to knock will around until will transforms into a werewolf himself and the two fight it out.

If your longing for the glory days of lycanthropy, watch Universals 'Werewolf Of London', 'The Wolfman', any Paul Naschy 'Wolfman' flick, the original 'Howling', 'An American werewolf In London', or even the SUPERB newer werewolf films 'Ginger Snaps 1,2, and 3'...stay FAR away from this utter piece of steaming wolf poo! If I could have given it ZERO stars I would have! KA-KAAA!!!",1,GAAAAK! WTF?
