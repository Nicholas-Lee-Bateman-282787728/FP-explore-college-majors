Along with a superb supporting cast, the movie was filmed in Russian locations shortly after the collapse of Communism, apparently with the full blessing of the Russian authorities. Duvall faithfully captures the enigma of Uncle Joe, perhaps as deadly to his ""friends"" as he was to his enemies. This brilliant piece of work should have been released to the big screen, but instead is confined to a dual DVD with Duvall's ""Assassination Tango.""

The portrayal of the Soviet Dictator by Robert Duvall including his Russian accent is just remarkable,an excellent actor as he is. Even the facial appearances of Lenin and Trotsky are very well represented. The depictions of Nikita Kruschev, NKVD/KGB Chief Beria, Stalin's wife, son and daughter,etc,etc, are all worth watching. The events leading to the Russian Revolution and its aftermath and the rising power/danger of Hitler and Nazism are all very craftily done.

Separately they each do their jobs quite well, but you can't help wondering what they had in mind when they decided to hitch them together.I understand the guys marketing this DVD package probably believed that releasing ""Stalin"" (one of Robert Duvall's best performances) by itself wouldn't have been profitable, but ""Stalin"" is a serious biopic whereas ""Assassination Tango"" is a workmanlike but not outstanding thriller. Both films stand up quite well on their own, but the package still looks a bit strange sitting on your bookshelf.But buy it anyway, even if the package is a bit off-putting.

His portrayal of Stalin who I have read about moved me to a deeper level of hatred of this murderous dictator. I get it, a movie is composed of great reaches of fact and fiction. However, the historical record is in and Stalin was as murderous a bigoted bastard on par with Hitler. The anti-semitism and cruelty of this man is well documented. In addition, his demonic rule is a reason why communism needed to be defeated and was defeated. Duvall is simply superb.Assassination Tango was written and directed by Duvall who is in fact a tango dancer and has a home in Buenes Aires. I had not heard of this movie but having it as a bonus was a pleasant surprise. He plays a NY hitman sent to Argentina. This is a very thoughtful and subtle movie and I give it 4 stars but the package 5-stars. I have a friend who lives in Buenas Aires and Duvall is well known and appreciated there.

Then, I saw this product and although I admire the actor, I could not imagine him in the role of Stalin. So years went by before I finally convinced myself to give this a try. Robert Duvall is absolutely riveting in this role. A quintessential American type becoming the Russian dictator without hammy accent or other ""artificial"" nonsense. Duvall was so good that you don't so much hear his speech as feel Stalin's menace and the power of his personality. Julia Ormond was also exceptional as the  very young woman who becomes Stalin's wife and challenges both his increasing monstrousness and the cowardice of his political allies and friends.I encourage anyone who has an interest in this period of Russian history and the personalities of that time to invest in this film.

He simply waits for Lenin to die and ""blackmails"" and then kills all his friends. This simple rule gets him ultimate dictator /commy leader. Oblivious to the starvation and sacrifice of his people he arrogantly has the army purged of ""good officers"" and takes food for money as his people starve and builds an Empire for his own use both financially and ultimate ruler. Robert LOOKS like Stalin right from the BAD dark hair dye job to his accent. Also very worthy of mention is Julia Ormond as his BELOVED wife Nadia who he drove to suicide and then called her a traitor. As Germany invades Russia the neurotic Stalin drinks his way to oblivion and then ruthlessly drives his army to help overthrow Nazi Germany. We also see the uncaring father he is by the death of his son and then his daughter he also drove away. Svletlana the ONLY one who remotely cared for Stalin narrates some of this story. As Stalin dies history will label him a MASS murder thanks to Nakita Kruchef who released the records of the murdered masses 10 years after the demise of Stalin. This is a good bio but 2/12 hours worth the watch for Duval as the commy with an agenda....HIS own. 4 STARS for this movie.Assignation Tango~ PLOT: Duval is a hit man sent to Argentina who kills time by TANGO with the lovely Manuela.
