You've got the old house; the multitude of spooky occurances that people see out of the corner of their eye, but are gone when they look directly; the dream sequences with lots of running water, and people waking up screaming after a hand reaches out for them...I think you know what I mean.  Nevertheless, I found the movie fun.  I didn't get bored, despite the horror cliches.  The acting is good.  It had a horror-twist ending that I sincerely didn't guess before the end of the movie, which is always a positive sign.

The movie plot was different than some I've seen.  A very unique ending than expected too!  Very happy with the movie!  It should be watched maybe on a scary night or around Halloween to help set the mood and adventure. A special note also: (This is not for younger or small children!  There is strong Language, Abuse, Violence and  Nudity that is not for the younger crowd at all! It should be marked more clearly on this, which it is not!)  There is an added section for each actors take on the movie, from their point of view.

1023215,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000J103UW,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 3]","Part Thirt13n Ghosts, part Candyman, Spirit Trap is a low-budget British production with an attractive cast in a broken down house.  Five students - adorable Jenny (Billie Piper), drug dealing Tom (Luke Mably), his kinky girlfriend Adele (Emma Catherwood), creepy Tina (Alsou) and also adorable Nick (Sam Troughton) - move into a creepy London mansion. It is dominated by a spirit clock that, once Nick repairs it, begins counting down the time to a mysterious spiritual conjunction. As the clock ticks closer to the final hour, weird things start happening - Ouija boards work, mobile phones stop, water and shadowy mobs run through rooms.As the creep-factor escalates, the various characters reveal their neuroses.  Tom and Adele have a sadomasochistic relationship that ping-pongs from lust to hate.  Jenny is the daughter of a spiritualist who ""killed herself"" (although we find out later that's not quite accurate). SPOILER TRAP: The twist is that the house is actually between dimensions of the living and the dead, which means there's some fun ""is-she-or-isn't-she"" moments where living characters turn out to have been dead all along and murdered characters get a second act.  As a stage play, Spirit Trap could be a lot of fun.But this is a movie, and as such it demands levels of kinetic energy that never manifest.  It takes far too long to reveal who is really who and why the characters are all trapped in the house.  In between pointless character development, tawdry sex scenes, and horror retreads of other films, Spirit Trap throws in a plot about forbidden love and a racist lynching. It's hard to swallow, if only because Spirit Trap was never that deep to begin with.  Its history lesson on race relations (one that seems curiously out of place in Britain, but what do I know) feels a bit forced.Still, there's a moment in Spirit Trap where the characters finally do the logical thing and run out the front door.  It's at that moment the movie finally lets its hair down and goes for broke.  But it takes so long to get there that you'll be counting the seconds along with the irritating clock that shares half the running time on screen.",2,Counting down the seconds...,1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,2158,"['Part', 'Thirt13n', 'Ghosts', 'part', 'Candyman', 'Spirit', 'Trap', 'low-budget', 'British', 'production', 'attractive', 'cast', 'broken', 'down', 'house', 'Five', 'students', 'adorable', 'Jenny', 'Billie', 'Piper', 'drug', 'dealing', 'Tom', 'Luke', 'Mably', 'kinky', 'girlfriend', 'Adele', 'Emma', 'Catherwood', 'creepy', 'Tina', 'Alsou', 'also', 'adorable', 'Nick', 'Sam', 'Troughton', 'move', 'creepy', 'London', 'mansion', 'dominated', 'spirit', 'clock', 'once', 'Nick', 'counting', 'down', 'time', 'mysterious', 'spiritual', 'conjunction', 'clock', 'ticks', 'closer', 'final', 'hour', 'weird', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'Ouija', 'boards', 'work', 'mobile', 'phones', 'stop', 'water', 'shadowy', 'mobs', 'run', 'rooms.As', 'creep-factor', 'escalates', 'various', 'characters', 'reveal', 'neuroses', 'Tom', 'Adele', 'have', 'sadomasochistic', 'relationship', 'ping-pongs', 'lust', 'hate', 'Jenny', 'daughter', 'spiritualist', 'who', 'killed', 'find', 'out', 'later', 'not', 'quite', 'accurate', 'SPOILER', 'TRAP', 'twist', 'house', 'actually', 'dimensions', 'living', 'dead', 'fun', ""is-she-or-isn't-she"", 'moments', 'where', 'living', 'characters', 'turn', 'out', 'have', 'been', 'dead', 'along', 'murdered', 'characters', 'get', 'second', 'act', 'stage', 'play', 'Spirit', 'Trap', 'could', 'be', 'lot', 'fun.But', 'movie', 'such', 'levels', 'kinetic', 'energy', 'never', 'manifest', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'reveal', 'who', 'really', 'who', 'why', 'characters', 'are', 'trapped', 'house', 'pointless', 'character', 'development', 'tawdry', 'sex', 'scenes', 'horror', 'retreads', 'other', 'films', 'Spirit', 'Trap', 'plot', 'forbidden', 'love', 'racist', 'lynching', 'hard', 'swallow', 'only', 'Spirit', 'Trap', 'was', 'never', 'that', 'deep', 'begin', 'history', 'lesson', 'race', 'relations', 'one', 'curiously', 'place', 'Britain', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'bit', 'forced.Still', 'moment', 'Spirit', 'Trap', 'where', 'characters', 'finally', 'do', 'logical', 'thing', 'run', 'out', 'front', 'door', 'moment', 'movie', 'finally', 'hair', 'down', 'broke', 'so', 'long', 'get', 'there', ""'ll"", 'be', 'counting', 'seconds', 'irritating', 'clock', 'shares', 'running', 'time', 'screen']",Spirit Trap

I understand that they want to draw the younger crowd but WHY must they ALWAYS typecast our ""future"" as stupid drugged out people?  We do have proof that Hollywood on occasion does put out a a few good horror movies such as Halloween 1978 (Micheal Myers rocks and you should get the 25th anniversary edition which features all the men who played him in all the films 1,2,4, 5,6 7,8 and who knows who will play him in 9), The Glass House (The Good Mother with Angie Harmon), The Others, The Hills have Eyes remake, Texas Chainsaw massacre remake, The Wrong Turn. But we all know that remakes fail badly too such as The Amityville Horror and The Omen but they at least make them well so we know it can be done so why on this earth are they producing such horrible films?  Yes, it is taking so much more these days to scare us in this horrible world but why can't Hollywood see (as with The Others) that all we (ages of 18 to 99) just want is a good haunted house movie that truly chills us to the bone and not all this crap they are putting out today?  The acting in this film was actually good (shocking, I know) but why did it fail?  London, an old scary house, a victorian plot (Candyman type plot revealed ----yes, but we all know it happened in Civil War times over and over again but that was our history and it makes an excellent plot with it's romantic lustful unmentionable love of that time)....... BUT a drugged out, vodka drinking crazy twosome totally ruins the whole thing with their stupid antics ........

This film was different enough to capture my interest, with a beautiful haunted house filmed carefully to show the subtle colors and textures.  I enjoyed seeing a cast that I didn't recognize for once, and the acting was above par - I never yelled at the television, nor flung cheezy poofs across the living room.  I'd like to see what the director would do with better backing in the future; talented filming is a rarity nowadays, and these scenes were smooth and composed.  The set decoration was nice, but I wonder if anyone would leave antiques lying around a college rental.I wanted more detail about the history of a spirit clock, but perhaps this was just a plot device that the filmmakers invented.  I'm not sure how the rental company would be able to put that many people together in one place who all sported ""dark pasts"" and minor clock-fixing skills, so perhaps that's why it took two hundred years for those spirits to get it right.  Even though this was a bit predictable, I didn't go nuts hollering, ""Well, what are the odds of that?"" since it kept my interest and was fun to watch.
