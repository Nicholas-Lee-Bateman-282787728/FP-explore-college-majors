She used to cry when it ended, until we convinced her that she could watch it again if she wanted! Needless to say, we wore out that video tape.This one is watchable by parents and children. The production value is high, the children are adorable, and the dogs and puppies perform extremely well. It is the live dalmations that make this such an enjoyable tape-if your toddler likes dogs and puppies, this will be a winner.P.S., this is a quality program you won't mind your child watching over and over. It is not an ad for toys or Disneyland.",5,Wonderful!

My 14-month old even loves the beginning and laughs and gets super excited when the dogs are on. For the first couple songs the dogs are featured, and then it gets a little weird at the Bow Wow Ball and becomes all about dancing kids. This is more of a 3.5 star video, but I rounded up because if you kids like dogs then this may be worth it.",4,Wish there was more dogs and less Children,1387324800,"12 18, 2013",2013,402,"['beginning', 'sing-along', 'focuses', 'dalmations', '14-month', 'old', 'even', 'beginning', 'laughs', 'super', 'excited', 'when', 'dogs', 'are', 'first', 'couple', 'dogs', 'are', 'featured', 'then', 'little', 'weird', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'Ball', 'dancing', 'kids', 'more', '3.5', 'star', 'video', 'rounded', 'up', 'kids', 'dogs', 'then', 'may', 'be']",Sing-Along Songs - Pongo And Perdita

Daycare ended up buying it for him for his birthday.  He asks for ""Pongo""--and he will SIT for the 30 or so minutes this video lasts--this is amazing to me, as he does not sit still for more than 2 minutes and has an attention span the size of a gnat.Yes--for adults or older kids, this video is seriously annoying and obnoxious.  But toddlers will LOVE it, more often than not.  If I can get my son to sit for 30 minutes to give me time to do the dishes, clean the counters, get dinner started, or just relax with a magazine for a bit, then I can tolerate the annoying songs in the background!",5,This is for little kids..adults will loathe it,1322611200,"11 30, 2011",2011,751,"['2', 'year', 'old', 'LOVES', 'video', 'daycare', 'provider', 'were', 'watching', 'one', 'day', 'started', 'crying', 'wanted', 'keep', 'watching', 'Daycare', 'ended', 'up', 'buying', 'birthday', 'Pongo', 'will', 'SIT', '30', 'so', 'minutes', 'video', 'amazing', 'not', 'sit', 'still', 'more', '2', 'minutes', 'attention', 'span', 'size', 'gnat.Yes', 'adults', 'older', 'kids', 'video', 'seriously', 'annoying', 'obnoxious', 'toddlers', 'will', 'LOVE', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'can', 'get', 'son', 'sit', '30', 'minutes', 'give', 'time', 'do', 'dishes', 'clean', 'counters', 'get', 'dinner', 'started', 'just', 'relax', 'magazine', 'bit', 'then', 'can', 'tolerate', 'annoying', 'songs', 'background']",Sing-Along Songs - Pongo And Perdita
