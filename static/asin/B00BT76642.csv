A well placed expletive can definitely add a comedic punch, but when overused takes away from everything. Every other word uttered by the main character seemed like it was a curse word. At times it almost made the dialogue incomprehensible.The story is about 3 high school friends who reunite to celebrate their friend's 21 birthday. All three use the entire night to let loose and relive their crazy high school days of drinking and partying. The thing is, their friend has an extremely important interview for med school in the morning.I'm not going to lie, this movie had some funny scenes. A lot of it was so random, much like the Hangover movies, that you couldn't help but laugh. Most of it, however, was simply too unrealistic to be funny. And the use of racist language seemed unnecessary and uncalled for. It could have easily been removed and nothing would have changed.Within the first 5 minutes I could tell I wasn't going to be a fan of the movie. The main character was completely unlikeable throughout, which was evident from the cab scene. It only spiraled downhill from there, as he continued making one bad decision after the other, bringing his friends down with him. He does learn something in the end by re-enrolling in college, but his partying days are clearly not over. Not saying he has to always stay the straight and narrow, but when you have two nights when you stay out all night and get into some of the situations these guys did, it is time to reconsider your life decisions.If you have an hour and a half with absolutely nothing else to kill, then this isn't the worst movie available.

Astin's Casey is the stuffed shirt who's already on the fast track to a career on Wall Street after he graduates; Chon's Jeff is the stressed-out A-student whose dad is pressuring him to ace a med school interview the next day; and Teller's Miller  is the Stiffler-type wise-ass who refuses to grow up, convinced that the only life worth living is one patterned after the ""American Pie"" movies.Against their better judgment, Astin and Teller- take Chon out for a celebratory bender, resulting in what anyone with any knowledge of how these things customarily work out in the movies can plainly predict. Yet, beyond all the drinking, brawling, sex rituals and generalized pandemonium, ""21 and Over"" actually has some poignant things to say about friendship and finding that fine line between becoming a mature adult and selling out to a life devoid of fun and joy. Luckily, the screenplay by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (who also directed the film together) doesn't overdo it in the moralizing department, neatly balancing the insights with a steady stream of ultra-crass frat-boy hijinks. The movie even has some fun skewering the misogyny and sexual double standards that prevail among some of the male youth of today.The movie is helped immeasurably by the performers who bring both humor and heart to the proceedings.

I was expecting this film to be yet another chance to exploit the magic of the first Hangover film, but surprisingly it does not. The story has many similarities, but also a uniqueness about it. 21 & Over does manage to capture that amazing chemistry and magic that made the Hangover legendary. The whole time I was watching this film, I couldn't help but think, why didn't they put this kind of thought into the Hangover sequels? Don't get me wrong, I liked the sequels, but neither one of this is as good as this film was. Justin Chon, unfortunately only known from the Twilight series, stars in a role that was seemingly made for him. This guy was so freaking funny, that I had to be careful not to piss my pants, almost every time he opened his mouth. The other stand out is Project X's Miles Teller, and while he's much better looking than Alan, he does manage to capture that loveable extreme weirdness that Zack Galifinakis had. It's easy to look at 21 & Over and say it's going to be just like the Hangover, and you wouldn't be wrong. Parts of the film are eerily similar, but the youth factor and college atmosphere does give the film a life of it's own and trust me when I tell you, it was absolutely hysterical.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,1558,"['21', 'Over', 'directorial', 'debut', 'writers', 'Hangover', 'trilogy', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'called', 'Hangover', 'Jr', 'Jeff', 'Chang', '21st', 'birthday', 'High', 'School', 'friends', 'show', 'up', 'take', 'out', 'big', 'interview', 'morning', 'boys', 'are', 'planning', 'taking', 'easy', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'turn', 'out', 'way', 'was', 'expecting', 'film', 'be', 'yet', 'chance', 'exploit', 'magic', 'first', 'Hangover', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'story', 'many', 'similarities', 'also', 'uniqueness', '21', 'Over', 'manage', 'capture', 'amazing', 'chemistry', 'magic', 'made', 'Hangover', 'legendary', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'kind', 'thought', 'Hangover', 'sequels', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'liked', 'sequels', 'one', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'Justin', 'Chon', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'known', 'Twilight', 'series', 'role', 'was', 'seemingly', 'made', 'guy', 'was', 'so', 'freaking', 'funny', 'had', 'be', 'careful', 'not', 'piss', 'pants', 'almost', 'time', 'opened', 'mouth', 'other', 'stand', 'out', 'Project', 'X', 'Miles', 'Teller', 'much', 'better', 'looking', 'Alan', 'manage', 'capture', 'loveable', 'extreme', 'weirdness', 'Zack', 'Galifinakis', 'had', 'easy', 'look', '21', 'Over', 'say', 'going', 'be', 'just', 'Hangover', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'wrong', 'Parts', 'film', 'are', 'eerily', 'similar', 'youth', 'factor', 'college', 'atmosphere', 'give', 'film', 'life', 'own', 'trust', 'when', 'tell', 'was', 'absolutely', 'hysterical']",N/A

I have nothing against these people, but the result is a terrible movie, arguably among the worst of the year.The story is, not surprisingly, about young males Casey (Astin) and Miller (Teller) celebrating their best friend and straight-A college student Jeff&#8217;s (Chon) 21st birthday, getting drunk, and doing very silly things, while Jeff has an important interview to attend the next day.Yes, it&#8217;s basically the same concept as in &#8220;Hangover,&#8221; in which the &#8220;best friends&#8221; lose a bridegroom on the very wedding day. &#8220;21 & Over&#8221; attempts a similar tack but to much less effective results. Here, two best friends have to wander around the town with Jeff passing out, trying to locate Jeff&#8217;s room. As Nicole (Sarah Wright), a nice girl they met at a bar, seems to know Jeff and his address, they go to a sorority house where she lives.The story is not only impossible, but formulaic.

The only thing the film had going for it, is that the film had actors [we] haven't seen before. So, it seemed fresh in that aspect. But that's all. That was one of the reasons of the success of the original THE HANGOVER (and surprise! '21' was written and directed by the original screenwriters of the THE HANGOVER). However, the differences between the two films is that, at least ONE of films was funny (and we know which one). '21' was excrutiating and cringe-worthy and this reviewer somehow didn't laugh at any of the situations and misadventures of a trio of high school/college buddies celebrating one of them coming-of-age (and now he can legally drink in bars): Jeff Chang (Justin Chon). He is about to embark on a medical career upon completing his pre-med studies at a northwest american university (the university & college town location shots were impressive). It's his 21st birthday, and his two friends want to take him out to go bar-hopping to celebrate.  As it is always hard not to stereotype asian characters in film, the creators did a good job not to. However, in a kind of reverse stereotyping they did however portrayed asian parent(s) as expecting their children to excel in academics. Which isn't too bad and they kind of made the asian parent a pretty strong (if not a very angry) asian figure.

So his two buddies drag him out and go drinking at basically every bar they come to.  Because let's face it, when you turn 21 you do go out and drink because it's finally legal and they can't keep you out anymore.So the character Jeff gets wasted beyond belief even though he has a college interview to med school tomorrow and he basically passes out from drinking way too much.  He gets into wacky situations as his friends try to get him back to his home so he can sleep it off and go to his interview in the morning.Of course he has an overbearing father who wants him to go medical school when he doesn't really want to.  His two buddies learn that he isn't as perfect as he seems and the two re-connect over the course of the movie and they realize how much they all missed one another.
