It's not long enough to keep you enthralled, but it is intriguing to delve into the minds of some of these psychos and see what makes them tick. NOVA does a good job as a documentary, but doesn't really go into depth about the makings of a serial killer, or the profiling of a serial killer. The film would have been much better had it been better researched and lengthier, but it is still a fascinating review of some of the famous serial killers of our time.",4,A creepy film about creepy people.,1031356800,"09 7, 2002",2002,500,"['husband', 'watched', 'together', 'not', 'long', 'enough', 'keep', 'enthralled', 'intriguing', 'delve', 'minds', 'psychos', 'see', 'what', 'tick', 'NOVA', 'good', 'job', 'documentary', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'depth', 'makings', 'serial', 'killer', 'profiling', 'serial', 'killer', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'researched', 'lengthier', 'still', 'fascinating', 'review', 'famous', 'serial', 'killers', 'time']",N/A

570039,A3GYVMUS7SSDFW,B000056NWC,Kyle Tolle,"[16, 17]","Since the 1960's, the murder rate in the United States has doubled and an average of 55 people are killed every day.  Some of the most difficult homicides to solve are those perpetrated on complete strangers due to a lack of easily identifiable suspects and no evident motives.Over 1000 cases are examined annually regarding serial offenders and the FBI's Investigative Analysis division is often the group that is tasked with attempting to find these elusive killers.  Describing techniques developed in the 1970's, current processes used in crime scene investigation and criminal profiling is looked at here.  Some of these methods have proven successful after discovering patterns and behaviors of some killers.While many cases can be solved using good old fashioned detective work, others are difficult due to the unpredictability of some serial killers and this is what makes them the more disturbing and frightening of all criminals.  Interviews with psychiatrists and law enforcement officials offer insights into the abnormal and devious mindset of these offenders.Although short references are made to several high profile criminal cases and famous serial killers in this program, the latter half of this documentary focuses primarily on Arthur Shawcross and his killing spree of numerous prostitutes in Rochester, New York.  This is quite interesting in and of itself because there is a detailed examination of all the work that went into solving this crime.This feature isn't all encompassing because it's hard to tackle such an intriguing and in-depth topic in only one hour of material.  NOVA leans more toward the science of profiling and behavioral studies more than anything else but they do it well in my opinion.  I just wish they would produce longer shows as the topics they document are usually very appealing.",4,A compact but interesting look into a serial killer's psyche,1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,1831,"['1960', 'murder', 'rate', 'United', 'States', 'doubled', 'average', '55', 'people', 'are', 'killed', 'day', 'most', 'difficult', 'homicides', 'solve', 'are', 'perpetrated', 'complete', 'strangers', 'due', 'lack', 'easily', 'identifiable', 'suspects', 'evident', 'motives.Over', '1000', 'cases', 'are', 'examined', 'annually', 'regarding', 'serial', 'offenders', 'FBI', 'Investigative', 'Analysis', 'division', 'often', 'group', 'tasked', 'attempting', 'find', 'elusive', 'killers', 'Describing', 'techniques', 'developed', '1970', 'current', 'processes', 'used', 'crime', 'scene', 'investigation', 'criminal', 'profiling', 'looked', 'here', 'methods', 'have', 'proven', 'successful', 'discovering', 'patterns', 'behaviors', 'killers.While', 'many', 'cases', 'can', 'be', 'solved', 'using', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'detective', 'work', 'others', 'are', 'difficult', 'due', 'unpredictability', 'serial', 'killers', 'more', 'disturbing', 'frightening', 'criminals', 'Interviews', 'psychiatrists', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officials', 'offer', 'insights', 'abnormal', 'devious', 'mindset', 'short', 'references', 'are', 'made', 'several', 'high', 'criminal', 'cases', 'famous', 'serial', 'killers', 'program', 'latter', 'half', 'documentary', 'focuses', 'primarily', 'Arthur', 'Shawcross', 'killing', 'spree', 'numerous', 'prostitutes', 'Rochester', 'New', 'York', 'quite', 'interesting', 'detailed', 'examination', 'work', 'went', 'solving', 'crime.This', 'feature', ""n't"", 'encompassing', 'hard', 'tackle', 'intriguing', 'in-depth', 'topic', 'only', 'one', 'hour', 'material', 'more', 'science', 'profiling', 'behavioral', 'studies', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'do', 'well', 'opinion', 'just', 'would', 'produce', 'longer', 'shows', 'topics', 'document', 'are', 'usually', 'very', 'appealing']",N/A

Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[0, 2]","The DVD's focus was to provides insight into why serial killers go on murderous rampages, and show how that insight is used to help capture them. Most of the coverage involved a middle-aged male serial killer of prostitutes in Rochester, N.Y. - tracking his killings and attempting to analyze his motivations. Inadvertently, however, the material also revealed that the perpetrator had recently been released from prison for killing two children, then run out of the town he moved to, and then resettled into Rochester by authorities just prior to the serial killings began there. My belief is that he should have been caught much sooner through traditional detective work.Similarly, with Wayne Williams, the African-American convicted of killing a number of young blacks in the Atlanta area. He was caught when police noticed he was dumping bodies in the water - the psychological profiling made no contribution.",3,"Interesting, but Also Disappointing -",1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,913,"['DVD', 'focus', 'was', 'insight', 'why', 'serial', 'killers', 'go', 'murderous', 'rampages', 'show', 'how', 'insight', 'used', 'help', 'capture', 'Most', 'coverage', 'involved', 'middle-aged', 'male', 'serial', 'killer', 'prostitutes', 'Rochester', 'N.Y.', 'tracking', 'killings', 'attempting', 'analyze', 'motivations', 'Inadvertently', 'however', 'material', 'also', 'revealed', 'perpetrator', 'had', 'recently', 'been', 'released', 'prison', 'killing', 'two', 'children', 'then', 'run', 'out', 'town', 'moved', 'then', 'resettled', 'Rochester', 'authorities', 'just', 'prior', 'serial', 'killings', 'began', 'there', 'belief', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'caught', 'much', 'sooner', 'traditional', 'detective', 'work.Similarly', 'Wayne', 'Williams', 'African-American', 'convicted', 'killing', 'number', 'young', 'blacks', 'Atlanta', 'area', 'was', 'caught', 'when', 'police', 'noticed', 'was', 'dumping', 'bodies', 'water', 'psychological', 'profiling', 'made', 'contribution']",N/A
