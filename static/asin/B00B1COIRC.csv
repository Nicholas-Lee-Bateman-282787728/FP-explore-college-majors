1620885,A2H4AWIOK1REMX,B00B1COIRC,"J. C Clark ""eanna""","[0, 0]","The reviews here are plot summaries. I won't do that again. Instead, I will briefly answer why a film as predictable and clich&eacute;d as this is so much fun?A film about typing? Really? Yes indeed. Typing makes a great anchor for this story for a number of reasons. Rose learns to do it well on her own, but cannot get to the very top without help. Athletic training that focuses both the body, as competitive typing is obviously grueling, and the mind, where focus and attention and using some smarts on the opponent are all important. The girl from the sticks can compete with the princesses of the world when she sets her whole mind to it.Next, it is beautifully filmed. So many movies set 50 years ago look like play sets, with just enough period artifacts to create the aura of the era. Not this. It looks as if it were filmed in 1959. And not only the look, but the color and scent as well. It reeks of its era, and it does so gorgeously. The 50s were not drab. My generation has spent many years teaching how boring and gray flannel and conformist that decade was, only to be opened like a can by the freedom of the 60s. Well, if you actually look at the books, music, art, and film of the 50s, you will see any number of glorious and wonderful things. (Actually, it was the 60s, and their insidious totalitarian influence that is still hanging over us today; that was, and remains, the height of conformity, but that's another question.) This film captures that color and sparkle and energy.And finally, though in every single movie where we see two people who don't like each other we know they will be in love at the end, in this film, we can see why they fall in love. Imagine that! Rounded characters. These are driven people without a place to drive, and when given a track, blossom like, well, a rose. (Mixing metaphors rafter badly here...but you get the idea.) They achieve. And achieving is fun. And they enjoy achieving together.Delightful characters, more complex that your standard issue lovers-to-be, with an intelligent script and lovely setting, make a fine evening's entertainment.",4,"Captivating, 4.5 stars",1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,2107,"['reviews', 'here', 'are', 'plot', 'summaries', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'again', 'Instead', 'will', 'briefly', 'answer', 'why', 'film', 'predictable', 'clich', 'eacute', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'film', 'typing', 'Really', 'Yes', 'indeed', 'Typing', 'great', 'anchor', 'story', 'number', 'reasons', 'Rose', 'do', 'well', 'own', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'very', 'top', 'help', 'Athletic', 'training', 'body', 'competitive', 'typing', 'obviously', 'grueling', 'mind', 'where', 'focus', 'attention', 'using', 'smarts', 'opponent', 'are', 'important', 'girl', 'sticks', 'can', 'compete', 'princesses', 'world', 'when', 'whole', 'mind', 'it.Next', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'So', 'many', 'movies', 'set', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'look', 'play', 'sets', 'just', 'enough', 'period', 'artifacts', 'create', 'aura', 'era', 'Not', 'were', 'filmed', '1959', 'not', 'only', 'look', 'color', 'scent', 'as', 'well', 'era', 'so', 'gorgeously', '50s', 'were', 'not', 'drab', 'generation', 'spent', 'many', 'years', 'teaching', 'how', 'boring', 'gray', 'flannel', 'conformist', 'decade', 'was', 'only', 'be', 'opened', 'can', 'freedom', '60s', 'Well', 'actually', 'look', 'books', 'music', 'art', 'film', '50s', 'will', 'see', 'number', 'glorious', 'wonderful', 'things', 'Actually', 'was', '60s', 'insidious', 'totalitarian', 'influence', 'still', 'hanging', 'today', 'was', 'height', 'conformity', 'question', 'film', 'color', 'sparkle', 'energy.And', 'finally', 'single', 'movie', 'where', 'see', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'other', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'love', 'end', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'fall', 'love', 'Imagine', 'Rounded', 'characters', 'are', 'driven', 'people', 'place', 'drive', 'when', 'given', 'track', 'blossom', 'well', 'rose', 'Mixing', 'metaphors', 'rafter', 'badly', 'here', 'get', 'idea', 'achieve', 'achieving', 'fun', 'enjoy', 'achieving', 'together.Delightful', 'characters', 'more', 'complex', 'standard', 'issue', 'lovers-to-be', 'intelligent', 'script', 'lovely', 'setting', 'make', 'fine', 'evening', 'entertainment']",Populaire

Power ""nlp trainer""","[6, 7]","Because the movie I wanted to see was not due to start for another hour, I wandered to another cinema, and noticed this movie starring Berenice Bejo, the actress from The Artist which won five Oscars.  I decided to watch it.Populaire may best be described as a stylish French movie which blends the excellence of My Fair Lady, with elements of Rocky.A girl from a provincial town has a dream of being a secretary, not the loftiest of dreams perhaps, but she heads to the the city for a job interview where many girls have the same dream.  The girl can best described as a charming composite of Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepburn.When the employer rejects her for the job, and goes to call the next girl, she sits down at the typewriter, and hunts and pecks at incredible speed.  Impressed, the handsome employer hires her.  A week later, still impressed by her speed but not impressed by her incompetence as a secretary he proposes to fire her unless...The employer still has a thing for an old flame who provides a mature casual sophisticated sexy contrast to our innocent girl and seems more obsessed with our girl winning typing competitions than anything else, like Rocky's coach in Rocky.  You may wonder if that can change, and our girl gets an unlikely ally in her pursuit of love.If you're like me you root for the girl, both in typing and in love, but as we know from movies if not from real life the course of true love does not always run smooth.  The music helps to convey the atmosphere both of love and the 50s beautifully, and the further the movie progressed the more I was drawn into the love story.Some of the scenes particularly the competition scenes I loved particularly how the women are so competitive, and I loved the facial expressions and the psyche outs.  Very subtle touches. This is a very clever movie which I absolutely loved. Sometimes I have difficulty persuading people that a movie is good.  This time though at least three people asked about the movie and said they were going to see it.It's very charming, and you are unlikely to see anything else quite like it.  It is subtitled but that did not diminish my enjoyment in any way.

1620887,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B00B1COIRC,MadMacs,"[1, 2]","Clever period film. Not only done in the style of a 1950s Technicolor classic, but reproduced down to the smallest technical and artistic detail. The fifties-inspired animated intro sequence, the pastel palettes for costume and set design, and the editing utilizing the soft cutaway. Impressive. And yet, while Director R&eacute;gis Roinsard and company created what at first blush appears to be just another routine romantic-comedy - however gorgeous - appearances are only skin deep. This film offers a much more layered composition than a typical genre production.It is 1958 in France, thirteen years after liberation.We're introduced to simple beauty Ms. Rose Pamphyle. Living in a rural fishing village where her papa runs the local dry goods store, she dreams of becoming a city girl.And Rose has just discovered her ticket out: The typewriter.With no formal training, and using only two fingers, she pushes herself to become an incredible typist.Unsurprisingly, her deeply traditional father is unimpressed that his little girl has taught herself what he considers a useless skill. Anything not improving herself to become a wife and mother is by definition 'useless' from his perspective. Her stated desire to become a working professional and her absolute refusal to follow tradition, frustrates and confounds him. Worse, having already arranged her marriage to the town's most eligible bachelor, it becomes a breaking point of contention between parent and child. They part on very bad terms.Despite that awful hurt, she follows her passion to the bright lights.Rose's first job prospect is an eye opening splash of cold water. She unhappily discovers that there are standards and expectations she never anticipated - her interview is cut short. Making a desperate last second grasp at her fading dream, picks up a form letter she discovered next to the office typewriter. With the speed of Mercury and the accuracy of a Terminator - blasts out a perfect copy.Monsieur Louis &Eacute;chard, who had just dismissed her as a potential candidate, is impressed. But can she actually do more than just type?Turns out - no.But Rose comes into his life at a strange confluence of personal reflection. Already insecure about his position in the family business and jealous of his expat American buddy, for reasons that go beyond their friendly wagers, decides to take the young woman on as a personal challenge. He's going to train her to become the world's fastest typist. A champion. And though her success he believes he will resolve and release the emotional baggage that he's carried since the end of the war. Concrete proof he was always the better man.To accomplish this goal: Louis insists that the strict training regimen he has planned requires Rose move in with him. Alone in the family estate far away in the country. She's understandably suspicious. But he makes it clear he wants only one thing from her - she will succeed where he failed.Soon, their personal frictions and constant elbow rubbings become something more.Not going to say that this was a cinematic masterpiece. It was however a very good film with unexpected depth injecting modern angst and storytelling into, what at first glance, seems like a run-of-the-mill romcom; quietly revealing itself to be a surprisingly complex character study.I'm torn between five and four stars. Everything in this production fits my definition of a near five-star film. But there was some unspoken disconnect, a creepy 'ick', that I couldn't get over when it came to co-star Romain Duris who played the male lead Louis &Eacute;chard.Call it a solid four.Movie Note:- Despite being a common digital composite of real-life and CGI, I was truly impressed by the outdoor scene where Louis and Rose drive under the Eiffel Tower. The vintage cars, people walking the streets, the simple mid-20th century cityscape - everything was perfect. It was like being given a chance to pull back the curtain of time and see the world that once was.

1620888,A1Y78WGTPIN9YV,B00B1COIRC,"Michelle ""Navy Gunner""","[2, 2]","Populaire 2012 French movie.  5 stars &#9733; and loved it &#9829;I really loved this movie.  I watched it on my kindle with Netflix streaming (on the app).  It's a romantic comedy in the late 1950's setting.  The name Populaire is for the famous typewriter machine by Japy Populaire.  It's a feel-good-romance, in which it's a little predictable but with a little realistic touch to it.  There is more to the plot than the romance and I liked that.  I was laughing and cheering for Rose.The story focuses well on Rose Pamphyle - played by D&eacute;borah Franois. She wants to be more than a store clerk for her father's shop and be engaged to a local mechanic.  But she's very clumsy.  She then becomes a secretary for Louis &Eacute;chard (played by Romain Duris), even though she only uses two fingers to type and causes chaos (accidently shreds important document and broke shredding machine).  But that's all ok for Louis because he plans to have Rose become the World Champion in typewriting.The acting was really good.  Sometimes I was so focused on them that I'd forget to read the subtitles.  I really liked Rose.  The actress did a great job, especially with her typing skills.There's other subplots like Louis and his friends, Marie and Bob Taylor (B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo and Shaun Benson) and their two kids.  Marie Taylor is Louis's ex so that gave a good twist.

1620889,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00B1COIRC,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[0, 3]","Q-W-E-R-T-YFingers to home positions and go...Quirky small town characters and obsessed competitors, ""Mad Men""-era design and the universally loved story of an underdog defying the odds are all combined to make ""Populaire"", the new French comedy from writer/director Regis Roinsard, a fun little romp.When Rose Pamphyle (Deborah Francoise, ""L'Enfant"") comes of age, her first act is to leave the sleepy French village and the family grocery behind. She wants the big city, she wants excitement, she wants more. But the only thing she is really good at is pounding away on the tiny typewriter her father keeps in the window of the family general store. She is incredibly fast, but has no training or skill. She talks her way into a job as a secretary at a small insurance firm owned by Louis (Romain Duris) who quickly becomes frustrated by her lack of secretarial skills. But he is amazed by her typing speed and thinks she could win the national Speed Typing Championship, she just needs training. The road to victory is bumpy at first, but Louis decides to quietly move her in to his house so the training can continue beyond work hours. Louis enlists the aid of his friends, Marie (Berenice Bejo, ""The Artist""), an ex-girlfriend now married to Bob (Shaun Benson, lots of TV credits), an American who stayed behind after the war, to help Rose become the champion Louis sees in her. Marie is a piano teacher, so Rose begins to learn to play. Bob becomes a one-man cheering squad and provides encouragement to his good friend, Louis.Every French film these days seems to have Romain Duris in it. He is our generation's Gerard Depardieu and it is easy to see why he is so popular. While he is good looking, he isn't matinee idol handsome and this allows him to step into a lot of ""everyman""-type roles. But he is also instantly recognizable; as soon as he flashes his crooked grin, I can imagine all of the French girls swooning. As Louis, he fits into the era and its conventions well. He isn't beyond flirting and carrying on, but he also recognizes he has an image to protect and a business to run. As soon as he decides to help Rose become a Speed Typing Champion, he concentrates all of his energy on reaching this goal. And, per romantic comedy conventions, he fails to notice when he is being too hard on Rose and is oblivious to her growing attraction to him. Will he realize she is in love with him, and he with her, before it is too late?Rose is so desperate to get out of the sleepy French village where she grew up, she would probably take any job, but she is a fast typist, so... Francois is very good, almost darling, as Rose channeling a little bit of Debbie Reynolds in her heyday. She follows the conventions established by Reynolds or Doris Day and quickly becomes interested in her boss, the attraction growing unnoticed as they work very closely together. As the story is set in the late 50s, she is also very worried about her image and social standing; when Louis suggests she move into a vacant room at his house, she is taken aback and wonders what others will think. In fact, the woman who runs the boarding house where she lives is suspicious and starts to spreads rumors. The fact Francois is able to evoke the spirit of Reynolds or Day is a compliment, not a criticism. If you are going to do a homage, do it well, and Francois does it well.Throughout, Roinsard seems influenced by a variety of different things - ""Mad Men"", underdog films like ""The Full Monty"", the romantic comedies of Doris Day and Rock Hudson and more. As Rose competes, the field is narrowed until she is finally up against the National Champion. Getting to this point involves a lot of montage and it moves the narrative at a fast clip. Later, more montage to evoke the period and how Rose's life is changed by her new circumstances. My one complaint would be that this film is too American. I go to foreign films to experience and witness a different way of life, a different kind of story. ""Populaire"" is fun, but it isn't very challenging. In fact, most foreign films we see in American cinemas are more ""American"" in style. The companies releasing them want to tap into the American audience and their moviegoing dollars. Challenging films, more ""French"" films, may have a more difficult time finding a limited audience. Of course, there are many factors involved, but the more ""American"" a film is, the more chance we have to get a chance to see it.You will have a fun time watching ""Populaire"".

1620890,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00B1COIRC,Tsuyoshi,"[15, 15]","""Populaire"" is a French romantic comedy starring Romain Duris (""The Spanish Apartment"") and D&eacute;borah Franois (""The Page Turner""). And believe me or not, this charming movie is not just about romance and coemdy; it is also about speed typing.Set in the late 1950s, ""Populaire"" follows a story of 21-year-old country girl Rose (D&eacute;borah Franois), who is hired as a secretary by an outspoken insurance agency owner Louis (Romain Duris). Rose, hardworking as she is, almost loses her job because of her complete incompetence, but her boss Louis, impressed with her great typing skills, proposes a deal. That is, Rose is allowed to stay if she enters a speed typing competition.The plot itself (slightly reminiscent of ""My Fair Lady"") is nothing new. The idea of watching women in old-fashioned 1950s costume feverishly hammering on a manual typewriter may hardly sound exciting, but because of the nice acting, clever camerawork and snappy editing, the competition sequences are surprisingly intense.The film is also notable for its colorful visuals inspired by the classic French and Hollywood movies. D&eacute;borah Franois's spirited heroine reminds us of Audrey Hepburn.Besides the two capable leads, the film has interesting supporting cast including B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo (Oscar nominated for her turn in ""The Artist""), Shaun Benson and Miou-Miou. The film is directed by feature first-timer R&eacute;gis Roinsard, who did a solid job. Photography is by Guillaume Schiffman (""The Artist"").""Populaire"" is a delightful and unpretentious romantic comedy with a bit of nostalgia.
