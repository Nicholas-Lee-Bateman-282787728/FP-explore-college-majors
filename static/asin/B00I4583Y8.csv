Sounds simple enough until Jack has to contend with  cops, mobsters, pimps, a nosy paraplegic desk clerk (Crispin Glover), a tall prostitute (Rebecca Da Costa), and a Serbian-Roman dwarf before his task is complete. If this sounds like a potential David Lynch film it falls short in the irony department.  The film is wacky but doesn't achieve the sublimely surreal status of, say, ""The Usual Suspects"".  I liked the turns by De Niro which recalls his Louis Cypher character in ""Angel Heart"" and Glover's portrait of another patented nutcase that seem to be his stock-in-trade since ""Back to the Future"".  If I could fault the film it would be that director David Grovic could have tightened things up a bit to enhance the tension.

1693419,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B00I4583Y8,MadMacs,"[0, 0]","First off, I wonder if Martin Scorsese enjoyed watching ""himself"" as a blood-soaked businessman? Surely his friend, Robert De Niro, spoke to him about the role after production wrapped up. So, I wonder if he enjoyed it?Clumsy and tiresome noir that, at least to me, harkens back to the neon glut 1980s and 90s which produced a stunning array of similar flicks.What made this mildly enjoyable, and tolerable at all, was John Cusack.In this production, he plays general contractor Jack - the guy who does whatever needs doing. In this case he's been ordered to pick up a bag, drive said bag to a craphole motel and deliver it to his client. Simple.In truth, he doesn't want the assignment. But three things preclude him from walking away.First, he wants the money. Second, once you say 'no' to the clients that hire for these kinds of jobs, it usually means you're not going to get another call. Third, his client is the rare type of employer for whom saying 'no' isn't an option. You're going to do the job or you become the next job.Like every noir - the paranoid itch only gets worse as the movie goes on. Jack quickly suspects that his client set this entire thing up just to mess with him. Why? What did he do so wrong that it would warrant an all-out gaslight of a bogus contract?Bodies begin piling up as he attempts to figure out what's really at play. Most importantly, does he have enough bullets to last the night?Overall, a retread and rubberstamp flick with little to offer. Made more obvious since this is David Grovic's first directorial film of any kind.Cusack did his energetic best to save this from the flushable ceramic bowl - for his effort alone I'm almost willing to bump this an additional very low third star. Almost.Two star pile, hit the plunger.Personal Note:- It's my sense that Grovic is very much like ""filmmaker""Mick Rossi. Essentially, a person with money to burn and now wants to spend it. Most of this stripe go the executive producer route, but every so often you get one that reaches way beyond their limited abilities and wants to become a star. Best said while mimicking Gloria Swanson in 'Sunset Boulevard'.- The single most interesting aspect to this flick: The inclusion of De Niro in the cast. What in the world would prompt him to do a cameo? My understanding is that his various investments and the continual movie roles being offered certainly cover his expenses. So I'm very curious what his motivation was for doing this schlock piece?

1693420,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00I4583Y8,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[9, 10]","THE BAG MAN isn't obviously inspired by PULP FICTION, but it comes close. It is a tale about aggressively quirky characters trading offbeat dialogue between scenes of unflinching violence in a convoluted plot that centers around a special bag into which no one may peek. The man in charge of the bag is Jack (John Cusak riding the same facial expression for most of the film), and he is given the assignment by his long-time boss, Dragna (Robert Deniro playing it oddly low-key for a character with a silver pompadour and a name like Dragna). Jack is to stay with the bag in the 13th room of a creepy-deepy motel and wait for Dragna to come and get it. The assignment turns out to be much harder than that, with everyone getting in on the action, including the wheelchair bound manager of the hotel (Crispin Glover), a couple of hard-nosed cops, and a hooker (with a heart of gold?) named Rivka.The plot moves forward with our MacGuffin deluxe being the mysterious bag (fun drinking game: count how many times the phrase &#34;Did you look in the bag?&#34; is asked), but really what keeps things moving (even if it's just running in place) is Rivka being constantly beaten or threatened. In fact, every bad guy in this film is very clearly established solely by their willingness to hit a woman, including Rivka's pimps, a black guy with an eye patch and a Serb-Croat midget. Naturally.Technically, the film fails right off the bat because it is filmed with a noir-style darkness, but without allowing any kind of contrast to most scenes, making it near impossible to tell exactly what's going on at any given moment. Fortunately (or not), not a whole lot goes on, as evidenced by the dialogue, which is repetitive to the point of distraction. I assume it was meant to be a stylistic choice -- having characters repeat each other and themselves dozens of times -- but instead of coming across as kooky or stylized or even just amusing, it sounds like the script has no idea where to go next.&#34;Did you look in the bag?&#34;&#34;What?&#34;&#34;Did you look in the bag?!&#34;&#34;No. Did you look in the bag?&#34;&#34;Are you asking me if I looked in the bag?&#34;&#34;Did you?&#34;&#34;No, I didn't look in the bag.&#34;&#34;Why didn't you look in the bag?&#34;&#34;Why didn't YOU look in the bag?&#34;And so on.Wasting time and direction that could be used to establish back story or personality, the movie instead spends most of its energy trying to craft a mood that is too sleazy to be clever and too self-aware to be amusing. Or maybe I have that backwards. In any case, when the movie DOES need to hint at a reason for all of its lunacy, it does so with no grace at all, characters announcing their various emotional calling cards, be it a dead wife or whatnot, often doing it with contrived attempts at wittiness that are, fundamentally, pointless. &#34;I'm a connoisseur of the unexpected, but I hate surprises,&#34; says Dragna. &#34;Just because something is inevitable doesn't mean it has to happen,&#34; says another character. Or they say something like that. I was laughing too hard to write the whole thing down.I'd give the film one star if I hadn't at least been amused by the intensely understated performances by Cusak and Deniro, and I still got a bit of joy out of watching the derivative script clump along so handily. Still, this isn't a movie that is bound to be enjoyed by many people.

He is instructed not to look into the bag. Things go bad. We reach a point where he is in the room. He has a dead man in the trunk of his car which doesn't lock. His hand is bleeding where his cell phone was shot out from it. There are two undercover agents next door. He gets entangled with a six foot tall prostitute (Rebecca Da Costa) her one eyed pimp (Sticky Fingaz) and a Serbian midget (Martin Klebba). Cops seem to be everywhere and the motel is run by the creepy Crispin Glover who learned everything he knows about motel management from Norman Bates.His boss calls him and tells him to read Hermann Hesse &#34;Magister Ludi&#34; which loosely relates to the mystery of the circus characters. Then things get weird.This is a noir style mystery. There are two mysteries here. One is &#34;What is with all the odd ball characters?&#34; and the second one is &#34;What is in the bag?&#34; I will say I had them both figured out before they were revealed as it fit an oddball formula. However, I grew annoyed with the film, able to feel the frustration of Jack, but not in a good way.The film has few characters. It has dark humorous elements added to this crime drama thriller. Indeed, the plot alone is darkly comical. The film has a lot of things going for it, and as a fan of the genre, it was able to grab me, but then kept letting me go.3 1/2 stars.
