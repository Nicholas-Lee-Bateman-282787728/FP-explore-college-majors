1327086,A1ITCVZ46MUB3A,B00363WGB4,A Hot Whizzer Summer...,"[4, 7]","Although I was not a massive fan of the TV show, I did enjoy it. Despite this fact, I found the movie was not nearly as funny. About half way through the movie, I had had enough and was ready to put it down.The jokes were subpar, and while I enjoyed a couple of the jokes, many of them were repeated numerous time, and became boring after the third or forth time you heard them. For example,****spoiler**** hero has a dead girlfriend, and rather than having a couple jokes at her expense, they literally dragged her through the entire movie, cause watching him kiss her for the forth time is just as funny as the first. ***end spoiler***Many of the jokes get repeated so many times they cease to be funny 30 minutes in. The movie has it's moments. It is vulgar, indecent, and nasty, but you expect that. The whole point of the movie to is to make fun of ""having a point"". However, drawn together just draws on old used ideas. The storyline is basically recycled, and the plot is ripped off. Then again, the whole show rips off of other shows, so why can't they also rip off the plot, points, and ideas?In the end, it was kind of boring to me. I give it two stars, because it had some good parts that made me smile, but it was not nearly as funny as other movies that did not need to depend on so much vulgarity.",2,Not very impressed,1271894400,"04 22, 2010",2010,1311,"['was', 'not', 'massive', 'fan', 'TV', 'show', 'did', 'enjoy', 'fact', 'found', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'funny', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'had', 'had', 'enough', 'was', 'ready', 'put', 'down.The', 'jokes', 'were', 'subpar', 'enjoyed', 'couple', 'jokes', 'many', 'were', 'repeated', 'numerous', 'time', 'became', 'boring', 'third', 'forth', 'time', 'heard', 'example', '****spoiler****', 'hero', 'dead', 'girlfriend', 'rather', 'having', 'couple', 'jokes', 'expense', 'literally', 'dragged', 'entire', 'movie', 'cause', 'watching', 'kiss', 'forth', 'time', 'just', 'as', 'funny', 'first', '***end', 'spoiler***Many', 'jokes', 'get', 'repeated', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'cease', 'be', 'funny', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'moments', 'vulgar', 'indecent', 'nasty', 'expect', 'whole', 'point', 'movie', 'make', 'fun', 'having', 'point', 'However', 'drawn', 'together', 'just', 'draws', 'old', 'used', 'ideas', 'storyline', 'basically', 'recycled', 'plot', 'ripped', 'off', 'Then', 'again', 'whole', 'show', 'other', 'shows', 'so', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'also', 'rip', 'off', 'plot', 'points', 'ideas', 'end', 'was', 'kind', 'boring', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'had', 'good', 'parts', 'made', 'smile', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'funny', 'other', 'movies', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'depend', 'so', 'much', 'vulgarity']",N/A

1327088,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B00363WGB4,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""","[1, 2]","I've been a fan of Drawn Together since it first went on the air, so when it was finally canceled I have to admit that I was a little sad. Upon hearing of an uncensored movie, I had mixed emotions. While it was good to have some DT rather than none, I was worried that actually hearing the uncensored stuff might ruin the movie.Foxxy Love has discovered something amazing. She & the rest of her castmates can not only cuss, but they can show full frontal genitalia & act as crude as they want. When she discovers that it is because of their show being canceled, her first action is to call the production company. Little does she know that this will cause them to gain the notice of the Network Head, who has his own reasons for wanting the entire cast gone.This movie was OK, but I have to say that I was a little disappointed. Part of what made all of the vulgarity fun in the show was that it was all censored. Part of the gag of it being a reality show is that despite them doing so many things that *did* make it past the censors, the cussing & nudity was still bleeped or blurred out. With the censorship gone, the movie just seemed to lack the edge the show had once had.Then there's the movie premise. Initially the idea of the gang trying to outrun an ""eraser"" named ISRAEL (complete with jokes) was interesting, but after a while the entire premise just felt thin. This was pretty much a half hour episode stretched out to just over an hour. There's also supposedly 3-D elements. I had a set of 3-D glasses lying around so I re-watched the scenes. The 3-D is really unimpressive, which might have been part of the joke. I'd rather that instead of putting the time into doing all of that, they'd worked on the story & humor a little more. I love crude humor but this just lacked. Oh, and guys? Constantly picking on South Park was only funny for the first 5-10 minutes.There is enough in the movie to entertain (the Disney princess scene was sort of funny), but offhand I'm glad that I waited & got this via a rental. It just wasn't as funny as I hoped it would be. If you really want to complete your collection, go ahead & get this but I *really* suggest that you rent it first.",3,"Decent, but will be a rental for most",1278633600,"07 9, 2010",2010,2189,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Drawn', 'Together', 'first', 'went', 'air', 'so', 'when', 'was', 'finally', 'canceled', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'little', 'sad', 'hearing', 'uncensored', 'movie', 'had', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'was', 'good', 'have', 'DT', 'rather', 'none', 'was', 'worried', 'actually', 'hearing', 'uncensored', 'stuff', 'might', 'ruin', 'movie.Foxxy', 'Love', 'discovered', 'something', 'amazing', 'rest', 'castmates', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'cuss', 'can', 'show', 'full', 'frontal', 'genitalia', 'act', 'as', 'crude', 'want', 'When', 'show', 'being', 'canceled', 'first', 'action', 'call', 'production', 'company', 'Little', 'know', 'will', 'cause', 'gain', 'notice', 'Network', 'Head', 'who', 'own', 'reasons', 'wanting', 'entire', 'cast', 'gone.This', 'movie', 'was', 'OK', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'Part', 'what', 'made', 'vulgarity', 'fun', 'show', 'was', 'was', 'censored', 'Part', 'gag', 'being', 'reality', 'show', 'doing', 'so', 'many', 'things', '*did*', 'make', 'censors', 'cussing', 'nudity', 'was', 'still', 'bleeped', 'blurred', 'out', 'censorship', 'gone', 'movie', 'just', 'seemed', 'lack', 'edge', 'show', 'had', 'once', 'had.Then', 'movie', 'premise', 'Initially', 'idea', 'gang', 'trying', 'outrun', 'eraser', 'named', 'ISRAEL', 'complete', 'jokes', 'was', 'interesting', 'entire', 'premise', 'just', 'felt', 'thin', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'half', 'hour', 'episode', 'stretched', 'out', 'just', 'hour', 'also', 'supposedly', '3-D', 'elements', 'had', 'set', '3-D', 'glasses', 'lying', 'so', 're-watched', 'scenes', '3-D', 'really', 'unimpressive', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'part', 'joke', ""'d"", 'rather', 'instead', 'putting', 'time', 'doing', ""'d"", 'worked', 'story', 'humor', 'little', 'more', 'love', 'crude', 'humor', 'just', 'lacked', 'Oh', 'guys', 'Constantly', 'picking', 'South', 'Park', 'was', 'only', 'funny', 'first', '5-10', 'minutes.There', 'enough', 'movie', 'entertain', 'Disney', 'princess', 'scene', 'was', 'sort', 'funny', 'offhand', ""'m"", 'glad', 'waited', 'got', 'rental', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'want', 'complete', 'collection', 'go', 'ahead', 'get', '*really*', 'suggest', 'rent', 'first']",N/A

1327094,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B00363WGB4,Haunted Flower,"[5, 9]","The Drawn Together Movie - The Movie! DVD Review1 Disc Widescreen Unrated Edition (2010)**This review is for a very crude animated television show worse than ""South Park"" so consider that before deciding whether to read on.**This DVD will be released on Tuesday, April 20th. It will also be available on iTunes, Xbox Live Marketplace, Zune, Sony Playstation Store, and Amazon Video on Demand. For the first time, Comedy Central Records will release ""Drawn Together: The Soundtrack"" on the same day. If the ending credits are any indication, the soundtrack is pretty funny.The ""Drawn Together"" TV Show being canceled brought about this direct-to-DVD movie appeared called ""The Drawn Together Movie - The Movie"" executive produced by Dave Jeser and Matt Silverstein. The ""Drawn Together"" TV Show premise was an animated reality tv show format with a bunch of cartoon characters from different genres: a superhero, a mystery-solving foxy musician, a Disney princess, a Spongebob freak, a Pikachu, a Betty Boop, gay Kingdom Hearts-type video game hero, and a loud pig. They would live together in one house and occasionally do competitions for.....whatever hosted by a guy with a speaker for a head.In this movie, Foxxy Love notices something is amiss when she notices the cast are no longer being censored so there's a mystery to solve! Their reality show has been canceled and a robot named I.S.R.A.E.L. voiced by Seth McFarlane wants to erase them. The gang tries to go on a journey to Make-A-Point Land in order to get a point to the series and get back on the air. The taker of their time slot (whom shall remain nameless so not to offend readers) helps them out on their quest and adding this additional character who was like a little girl from ""South Park"" helped make it just a little bit funnier and she even got her own song. This movie gave the creators of the show an opportunity to end the story and say goodbye to the characters the way they wanted.""Drawn Together"" is one of the most crude shows ever seen. I remember I tried to watch an episode or two before but turned it off because it went too far for me, I am more of a ""South Park""/""Family Guy"" kind of girl. It makes ""The Simpsons"", ""South Park"", and ""Family Guy"" look like ""Sesame Street."" For example, there are some 3D animated scenes put in this movie, one of which is a ladies' three-way sex scene. There is an excessive amount of creative swearing, crazy gross sex jokes, and even corpse molestation. There is a giant character that poops into his own mouth involuntarily and he is actually featured on the DVD disc itself. If it sounds messed up, it's because it IS. You need a sick mind going into this to stick with it and it was way too much for me, but maybe if you have a super twisted sense of humor this is your thing.DVD Extras:The feature ""Drawn Together: Confessionals"" is interviewing the voice-over actors and discussing how the story came together based on the show actually being canceled and getting the opportunity to go over the line worse than ever before without being censored. The actors talk about their characters and wistfully speak about how this movie might bring about another season (riiiight). ""Drawn Together: The Legacy"" is a dead-pan tribute to the touching qualities of the show put to epic music. The ""Anatomy of an Animated Sex Scene"" shows the voice-over actors vocally performing the scenes for crowds at Comic-Con to get interest going to support the 3D spin.The most shocking extra is the 3D Glasses tutorial with a naked woman (shoulders to bellybutton, no head) demonstrating how to make your own 3D glasses to fully experience the 3D sex scene since Comedy Central cheaped out and did not include 3D glasses in this DVD. However, I'm sure they feel they made it up to you with a topless woman. The deleted scenes are actually just extended sequences stuck in between other scenes that weren't funny enough to include I guess. It is surprising because the whole movie is only about 70 minutes long, but the DVD includes over an hour of bonus material. Some of the additional scenes were not funny animated and are still in storyboard form like an embellishment of the threesome sex scene with an additional fight between the ladies. There are minisodes to introduce and sum up each ""Drawn Together"" character.",3,"The Drawn Together Movie: The Movie is more raunchy than South Park, Family Guy, and Simpsons x 10!",1271721600,"04 20, 2010",2010,4326,"['Drawn', 'Together', 'Movie', 'Movie', 'DVD', 'Review1', 'Disc', 'Widescreen', 'Unrated', 'Edition', '2010', '**This', 'review', 'very', 'crude', 'animated', 'television', 'show', 'worse', 'South', 'Park', 'so', 'consider', 'deciding', 'read', '**This', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'Tuesday', 'April', '20th', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'available', 'iTunes', 'Xbox', 'Live', 'Marketplace', 'Zune', 'Sony', 'Playstation', 'Store', 'Amazon', 'Video', 'Demand', 'first', 'time', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'Records', 'will', 'release', 'Drawn', 'Together', 'Soundtrack', 'same', 'day', 'ending', 'credits', 'are', 'indication', 'soundtrack', 'pretty', 'funny.The', 'Drawn', 'Together', 'TV', 'Show', 'being', 'canceled', 'brought', 'direct-to-DVD', 'movie', 'appeared', 'called', 'Drawn', 'Together', 'Movie', 'Movie', 'executive', 'produced', 'Dave', 'Jeser', 'Matt', 'Silverstein', 'Drawn', 'Together', 'TV', 'Show', 'premise', 'was', 'animated', 'reality', 'tv', 'show', 'bunch', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'different', 'genres', 'superhero', 'mystery-solving', 'foxy', 'musician', 'Disney', 'princess', 'Spongebob', 'freak', 'Pikachu', 'Betty', 'Boop', 'gay', 'Kingdom', 'Hearts-type', 'video', 'game', 'hero', 'loud', 'pig', 'would', 'live', 'together', 'one', 'house', 'occasionally', 'do', 'competitions', '..whatever', 'hosted', 'guy', 'speaker', 'head.In', 'movie', 'Foxxy', 'Love', 'notices', 'something', 'amiss', 'when', 'cast', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'being', 'censored', 'mystery', 'solve', 'reality', 'show', 'been', 'canceled', 'robot', 'named', 'I.S.R.A.E.L', 'voiced', 'Seth', 'McFarlane', 'erase', 'gang', 'go', 'journey', 'Make-A-Point', 'Land', 'order', 'get', 'point', 'series', 'get', 'back', 'air', 'taker', 'time', 'slot', 'whom', 'shall', 'remain', 'nameless', 'so', 'not', 'offend', 'readers', 'out', 'quest', 'adding', 'additional', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'South', 'Park', 'helped', 'make', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'funnier', 'even', 'got', 'own', 'song', 'movie', 'gave', 'creators', 'show', 'opportunity', 'end', 'story', 'say', 'goodbye', 'characters', 'way', 'wanted', 'Drawn', 'Together', 'one', 'most', 'crude', 'shows', 'ever', 'seen', 'remember', 'tried', 'watch', 'episode', 'two', 'turned', 'off', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'am', 'more', 'South', 'Park', '/', 'Family', 'Guy', 'kind', 'girl', 'Simpsons', 'South', 'Park', 'Family', 'Guy', 'look', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'example', 'are', '3D', 'animated', 'scenes', 'put', 'movie', 'one', 'ladies', 'three-way', 'sex', 'scene', 'excessive', 'amount', 'creative', 'swearing', 'crazy', 'gross', 'sex', 'jokes', 'even', 'corpse', 'molestation', 'giant', 'character', 'own', 'mouth', 'involuntarily', 'actually', 'featured', 'DVD', 'disc', 'messed', 'up', 'IS', 'need', 'sick', 'mind', 'going', 'stick', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'maybe', 'have', 'super', 'twisted', 'sense', 'humor', 'thing.DVD', 'Extras', 'feature', 'Drawn', 'Together', 'Confessionals', 'interviewing', 'voice-over', 'actors', 'discussing', 'how', 'story', 'came', 'together', 'based', 'show', 'actually', 'being', 'canceled', 'getting', 'opportunity', 'go', 'line', 'worse', 'ever', 'being', 'censored', 'actors', 'talk', 'characters', 'wistfully', 'speak', 'how', 'movie', 'might', 'bring', 'about', 'season', 'riiiight', 'Drawn', 'Together', 'Legacy', 'dead-pan', 'tribute', 'touching', 'qualities', 'show', 'put', 'epic', 'music', 'Anatomy', 'Animated', 'Sex', 'Scene', 'voice-over', 'actors', 'vocally', 'performing', 'scenes', 'crowds', 'Comic-Con', 'get', 'interest', 'going', 'support', '3D', 'spin.The', 'most', 'shocking', 'extra', '3D', 'Glasses', 'tutorial', 'naked', 'woman', 'shoulders', 'bellybutton', 'head', 'demonstrating', 'how', 'make', 'own', '3D', 'glasses', 'fully', 'experience', '3D', 'sex', 'scene', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'cheaped', 'out', 'did', 'not', 'include', '3D', 'glasses', 'DVD', 'However', ""'m"", 'sure', 'feel', 'made', 'up', 'topless', 'woman', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'actually', 'just', 'extended', 'sequences', 'stuck', 'other', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'funny', 'enough', 'include', 'guess', 'surprising', 'whole', 'movie', 'only', 'about', '70', 'minutes', 'long', 'DVD', 'hour', 'bonus', 'material', 'additional', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'funny', 'animated', 'are', 'still', 'storyboard', 'form', 'embellishment', 'threesome', 'sex', 'scene', 'additional', 'fight', 'ladies', 'are', 'minisodes', 'introduce', 'sum', 'up', 'Drawn', 'Together', 'character']",N/A

1327097,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B00363WGB4,I'm Right,"[1, 2]","Yeah yeah the show itself is great but the jokes in this just suck. It's interesting how Drawn Together progressed, I thought the first episode was kinda lame, but then it found it's footing and got much better a few episodes in. However even the worst episodes of Drawn Together are infinitely better than this abomination.Here's an example of a joke that reeks of desperation and unfunny: there's a monster who s***s into his mouth, and the gang move his external anus so it can defecate onto his shoulder instead. That's the joke. It's not funny, it's just mildly unpleasant to look at, much like most of this. Oh and while the movie goes on about how lame it is to shoehorn a point, the monster who s***s in it's mouth is wearing a shirt that says 'bipartisan', talk about hypocritical.I just waited the whole movie for it to get funny but it never does. The characters are there but they just kind of exist and say whatever one liners you'd expect, non delivering. Considering how much time it took them to make this movie it shouldn't seem this rushed and sloppy. Literally one joke I thought was clever where I.S.R.A.E.L. sleeps on a highway, and even then it doesn't skim the surface of what a mediocre episode of the show is capable of.Oh and there's the depressing layer of bitterness underneath it all, especially directed at South Park. Near the end the South Park mascot and the comedy central president start making out, as if South Park is the reason that Drawn Together got cancelled in the first place. It seems like they're just taking cheap shots at Matt Stone and Trey Parker for no reason other than they're pissy that their show got cancelled.It's like going to see a stand up comedian and seeing him just do a bitter rant, then when he needs to make a joke he pulls down his pants and defecates on the stage, then continues going on about his ex or whatever. It's awkward, unfunny, gross for no reason, and ultimately a miserable experience to go through.

Wrong. Dead wrong. Deader than Foxy's aborted fetuses, Spanky's son and Wooldor's entire family.Minutes after the movie started I realized something stunk very, very badly and no, it wasn't the cheap-o flash animation or Captain Hero's girlfriend, it was the writing.For starters, the story is pretty lame and doesn't really give the characters enough opportunities to exploit their parodic nature for laughs... strange, considering that the whole premise behind it revolves around said characters suddenly becoming aware that they are not ""real"" and their only reason to exist is to lampoon other cartoons. The pacing is so bad that the movie seems to go on and on for hours, even if it barely scratchs the 80 minute mark. The jokes are hit or miss at best (more miss than hit) and with the exception of the I.S.R.A.E.L. bits I didn't laugh out loud... this coming from an inmature manchild that will always take dumb scatological humour over serious political satire. And that's the main problem with this movie: as much as it justly lampoons the last South Park seasons for becoming boring because of its obsession with ""making a point"" and not delivering enough comedy, it ultimately becomes the exact thing it satirizes, since the material here's not exactly a laugh riot, and the ""humour should be just funny and doesn't need to make a point"" idea is repeated so much that it becomes a boring and relentlessly preachy point in itself.All this makes for a boring and miserable Drawn Together experience, something I thought unthinkable before watching this DVD. Seeing this movie, I'm grateful that Drawn Together was cancelled in its third season and didn't become an unfunny shadow of what it used to be as it happenned to The Simpsons, Family Guy and South Park after their first brilliant seasons...

Then it's over.I was reminded of two separate animation features as I watched this thing.The first was that screamingly bad Seth McFarlane junkCavalcade of Cartoon Comedy(Drawn is better, but not by much).  My association between these two features was induced fecally, as both this movie and Cavalcade were absolutely fascinated with excrement.  I'm not sure if animators are just way anal-retentive, or that maybe in animation classes they're constantly admonished, ""You can never, ever, at all, ever, and I mean not ever, put poop in cartoons.""  And so these guys, when they get the chance to cut loose really go for the doody jokes, graphically, unpleasantly, and in both the case of this movie and McFarlane's flop, unfunnily.The other film that came to mind was Ralph Bakshi's classic Fritz the Cat.  This groundbreaker came out nearly 40 years ago, and this Drawn Together movie basically covered an awful lot of what Bakshi did.  Yeah, this film wasn't saddled with Frit's X rating, but in terms of cartoon nudity and interactive sexual contact--where does the MPAA come down on this, exactly?--this movie is not offering anything that much wilder or wacky.  There's one pseudo-lady three-way in a Bedrock dive (of which you get a tad more in the special features), which is pretty raunchy, but that's about it.  And some creative penis sight gags starring some of your favorite `toon and comics heroes.As for having a point, the one barely intellectual aspect of this movie is that they cop to the TV show being cancelled because they were just raunchy, whereasSouth Parkcontinues to succeed because it is raunchy, but also delivers a social/political/ethical/philosophical point (which the Drawn characters dismiss as preachy and indulgent).  There are some great shots at South Park, both in this film's art and narrative, which one could take either as jealous backbiting or respectful emulation.  I have to agree with the premise, though: pure raunch can be funny (thinkJackass), but if you're delivering a backhanded compliment or stinging criticism on a hot issue with your wacky little `toons showing their special areas or spewing profanity and bodily excretions, that's a more interesting, better product.The special features are relatively good, with quite a few of them.  The deleted scenes aren't really deleted scenes in that they're small bits excised from scenes in the movie.  They're only an additional 10-20 seconds of content inexplicably pulled from the scenes of the movie.  Who knows why these bits--which are not that bad, and certainly in keeping with the overall intentional bad taste of the product--would have been pulled.  Did the producer really have a long, thoughtful conversation about pace, running time, narrative continuity, or over-the-top content with his director and artists?  Really?Bottom line: if you liked the TV show, you'll like this.  The bigoted, foul-mouthed, horny, filthy, perverted, vicious and otherwise idiotic crew are free to be who they always were.

1327113,A3VHLYBTGQHQ7O,B00363WGB4,The Trophy,"[3, 4]","Okay, I got my copy yesterday, and watched it first thing when I got home. To say that I've been psyched ever since I heard rumors of this coming out, about 2 years ago (IF I REMEMBER RIGHT), is an understatement. Now due to the enhanced graphics and the flow of the story progression, this movie seems like an actually movie and not just a long episode. Of course, I am comparing this to something like ""Family Guy: The Movie"" where it was just 3 episodes put together. Here it's something completely new and different than what we've seen before with the series. The story is excellent in my opinion, but unfortunately, this movie focused more on the story telling than the potty humor we've come to expect from ""Drawn Together."" So the story telling is good, but unfortunately there aren't as many quick and witty potty humor jokes as I'd like. Sure, there are a few, but not a lot. When they do attempt jokes, most made me smirk, not laugh, and they seemed like they borrowed the ""Family Guy"" style, ACCORDING TO ""SOUTH PARK,"" of writing to get these jokes together. So yeah, they put a bunch of balls, that had swear words, taboo topics, and body parts written on them, in a manatee tank. Then the manatees would pick certain balls in order, and POOF! There you go! There's your jokes. That's how the jokes seemed in this movie... Slapped together...and lame.Also, about the story, Captain Hero had a predicament that was funny at first, but then went on about an hour too long. Other than that, this movie pokes fun at South Park for being WAY TOO PREACHY (WHICH YES, IT HAS HAS BECOME AND I HATE IT! GO OFF THE AIR IF YOU CAN'T WRITE GOOD STORIES ANYMORE!!!!!) and that's awesome!!! Used to love South Park, but it should have gone of the air about 5 years ago when the episodes where still good and creative, now ""South Park"" is just based on stuff found on the front pages of newspapers or stuff you see on the news...Awesome??? NO, LAME. And that's what this movie tries to get at, ""Drawn Together"" left us with three seasons, with no episodes that were filler, and it ran it's course, instead of gradually getting worse and fading into obscurity, like ""South Park."" If you think I am being mean to ""South Park"" just watch the movie, and you'll see I am actually being nice to that show compared to how the movie depicts them!!!Lastly, there were some 3-D SCENES, but the DVD doesn't come with any 3D glasses!!! The Producer blames Comedy Central for this and that was funny. They do, however, give you a website for a printable template for the glasses and instructions on how to make your own glasses, with some red and blue plastic wrap...so you can still watch the 3D scenes, or if you have some old 3D glasses laying around, like I did, you can just use them, too. They work pretty well.Overall, I think maybe the $15 I paid for this movie, was a bit too expensive for what I got here. Sure, I liked it, but it could have been better. So I'd recommend renting this first and then buying it only if you truly like what you see and want to watch it over and over again.``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````AS A SIDE NOTE: Anyone see that video of the live script reading of the 3D s e x scene with Foxy and Toot???

My guess is they took out Moe's Tavern and used a bar in Bedrock, the town Fred Flinstone lives in, instead. Anyone have any info on that? Then comment my review with your answer.

1327114,A2OCJNB6B46OKP,B00363WGB4,"Underground Reborn ""gnome""","[1, 2]","So we all thought that reality TV was on its way out the door and then came `Jersey Shore'. That only meant one thing had to be done...Drawn Together had to make a comeback! Thus, what we loyal and sick minded fans got was our long awaited `Drawn Together' movie.Now, if you are a fan who bought the Uncensored Season DVD's the first few minutes may not be as enjoyable because you have already seen how far this show can go. I have to say with the other adult cartoons that have been given their own movies, Drawn Together may in fact be the best one.  The writers really did all they could to put together an offensive gem, getting the whole cast back and giving the fans all the jokes they love one last time. Still, the most impressive part happens to be the plot itself. It was a great way to pick up where the show left off and give these wonderful characters a real send off. Seth McFarlane plays the role of a new enemy, which may be one of the cleverest of offenses toward international politics . The story even gives us great character development of the Jew Producer. In the end you might actually love the guy after all the dumps he took on the DT gang.While there are a few major differences such as the fact that the movie is done in flash, to me it wasn't a major issue. The acting and the story of this movie were just as funny as the series itself. If you loved the series as much as I did you will barely even notice any serious changes.  The special features are great as well. My favorite would have to be the minisodes. These are perfect for a first time viewer of anything Drawn Together. But, truth be told you really should watch the series before you tackle the movie. The opening title sequence of the movie to me was my favorite part. While it really has nothing to do with the movie itself it just gives you a little in your face DT 101. I don't want to spoil it for you neither do I want to spoil the surprise you get during the end credits. You will just have to see them for yourself.So grab a seat and hold on to whatever you feel most comfortable gripping and prepare for one last hysterical romp for those 8 lovable characters you quote in public every day of your life.",5,"Watch it, love it, watch it again!",1272931200,"05 4, 2010",2010,2205,"['thought', 'reality', 'TV', 'was', 'way', 'door', 'then', 'came', 'Jersey', 'Shore', 'only', 'meant', 'one', 'thing', 'had', 'be', 'done', 'Drawn', 'Together', 'had', 'make', 'comeback', 'Thus', 'what', 'loyal', 'sick', 'minded', 'fans', 'got', 'was', 'long', 'awaited', 'Drawn', 'Together', 'movie.Now', 'are', 'fan', 'who', 'bought', 'Uncensored', 'Season', 'DVD', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'how', 'far', 'show', 'can', 'go', 'have', 'say', 'other', 'adult', 'cartoons', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'own', 'movies', 'Drawn', 'Together', 'may', 'fact', 'be', 'best', 'one', 'writers', 'really', 'did', 'could', 'put', 'together', 'offensive', 'gem', 'getting', 'whole', 'cast', 'back', 'giving', 'fans', 'jokes', 'love', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'Still', 'most', 'impressive', 'part', 'be', 'plot', 'was', 'great', 'way', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'show', 'left', 'off', 'give', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'real', 'send', 'Seth', 'McFarlane', 'role', 'new', 'enemy', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'cleverest', 'offenses', 'international', 'politics', 'story', 'even', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'Jew', 'Producer', 'end', 'might', 'actually', 'love', 'guy', 'dumps', 'took', 'DT', 'gang.While', 'are', 'few', 'major', 'differences', 'such', 'fact', 'movie', 'done', 'flash', 'was', ""n't"", 'major', 'issue', 'acting', 'story', 'movie', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'funny', 'series', 'loved', 'series', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'will', 'barely', 'even', 'notice', 'serious', 'changes', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'great', 'well', 'favorite', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'minisodes', 'are', 'perfect', 'first', 'time', 'viewer', 'anything', 'Drawn', 'Together', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'really', 'should', 'watch', 'series', 'tackle', 'movie', 'opening', 'title', 'sequence', 'movie', 'was', 'favorite', 'part', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie', 'just', 'little', 'face', 'DT', '101', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'do', 'want', 'spoil', 'surprise', 'get', 'end', 'credits', 'will', 'just', 'have', 'see', 'yourself.So', 'grab', 'seat', 'hold', 'whatever', 'feel', 'most', 'comfortable', 'gripping', 'prepare', 'one', 'last', 'hysterical', 'romp', '8', 'lovable', 'characters', 'quote', 'public', 'day', 'life']",N/A
