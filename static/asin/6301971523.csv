It only resembles the book in the most superficial of ways. The magic and charm of the book is lost in this animated version. I was very disappointed in it. Especially after wanting to see it for years. The songs in the film don't work as a way to advance the plot. They're just in there to be in there. They have no function at all.As stated, most of the charm and magic of the book is gone. You get the basic plot. Milo gets the tollbooth. Takes his journey to rescue Rhyme and Reason. Along the way are Tock and the Humbug. In a nut shell, you go from The Land of Expectations, to the Doldrums, to Dictionopolis, to Digitopolis to the Castle in the Air. 90% of the little side excursions are gone. No Valley of Sound. No Island of Conclusions. No cities of Reality or Illusions. No Alex. No 5/8 child. Heck, even the demons in the Mountains of Ignorance are not even that interesting. Rhyme and Reason are not much more than blobs of color. Almost like the animators just couldn't be bothered to even try and make them look like people. Tock is drawn all wrong. Short Shrift if wrong. I could go on and on.Since the book isn't all that long, I didn't see the need to cut so much of the more interesting parts out. If they had left out the songs, there would have been more than enough time to be more faithful to the book.I'll stick to reading the book. It's 100% better. Maybe in a few years some one will get the idea to make a more faithful adaptation. I hope so because if done correctly a movie of The Phantom Tollbooth could be really spectacular.

It's not perfect; a few too many times thoughtful solutions to problems from the book were replaced with slapstick, the film stops dead every time it hits a song, and the ending was radically changed -- and that last was a huge, gasping mistake, because it removes the original story's catharsis. On the other hand, some of the visualizations are wonderful; the Lethargians and Digitopolis are drawn with wonderful insight.I'd advise, though, presenting this movie to children as a companion to the book after they've already read it, not as a replacement and not by itself.Additional note: freed from the yoke of established characters, Chuck Jones absolutely let his imagination run free here, the result sometimes approaching Tim Burton levels of surreality.

282375,A3GQXLVWTJLARH,6301971523,Gordo the Gatling Gun,"[0, 0]","It's a shame that MGM had no idea how to market or promote this movie and after two years of sitting on the shelf (the film was made and completed in 1968; it was released in 1970), they ultimately decided to just release it in cinemas with no plan whatsoever. As a result, not only was it the only animated feature length film ever made by MGM to date; it was also the only feature film Chuck Jones ever got the opportunity to direct. Under more competent management, Phantom Tollbooth could have very well served as a stepping stone for Jones to cross over to feature length films to work as a rival to Disney.There is a bit of poetic irony with the failure of the film, though. The film falls victim to the studio heads' own lack of rhyme or reason. The film is about a young boy who goes through a magical tollbooth that takes him to an alternate dimension on a quest to rescue the two princesses: Rhyme and Reason. To get to his destination (that being the Castle in the Sky), he must first travel through Expectations, then Dull Country, then the Kingdom of Wisdom, split into two separate nations: One of words, and one of numbers, whose kings are convinced that their preference is superior to the other, and yet they and their subjects lack any critical insights or restraint in their affection; so much so that words and numbers are thrown in for no apparent reason.The film can be considered Chuck Jones' answer to Disney's Alice in Wonderland, and there is a lot to prove it, here. Unlike Alice though, Milo--our protagonist--is on a quest for the appreciation of intellectual pursuit, while Alice is just trying to get back home. Both characters, on the other hand, must travel through surreal landscapes, with symbols finding representation of the subconscious of the child. Both journeys also involve a quest through a collective consciousness rather than strictly the sub-consciousness of the individual children themselves. Overall, Phantom Tollbooth is a cinematic triumph and one of the few animated features that are in contention for best of their kind, and perhaps the best of all time.

In school, all he can think about is going home. At home, he still wishes he was somewhere else. However, Milo's world is turned upside down when a mysterious box appears in his bedroom. The box transforms into a kid-sized, magical tollbooth, complete with kiddie car and coins. Milo agrees to drive the little car through the talking tollbooth in the hopes of some sort of adventure, and he is not disappointed. Test driving through it a few times, he is amazed to find he is transformed into a living cartoon character. When he finally bites the bullet and goes all the way through, Milo enters a cartoon world of letters and numbers, kings and castles, demons and princesses, and all sorts of other oddities. The boy passes through all sorts of odd situations and obstacles, befriending a talking ""watchdog"" and a few other strange characters along the way, and learns the real value of knowledge and using time wisely when he quests to rescue two princesses from the terrifying ""Castle in the Air.""Starring Butch Patrick (TV's Eddie Munster) in the role of Milo, along with legendary voice talents the likes of Mel Blanc, Daws Butler, Hans Conried, June Foray, and many more, this Chuck Jones classic is a cherished memory to countless children who have seen it since its release in 1970. Based on the book by Norton Juster, ""The Phantom Tollbooth"" is all about the importance of thought and learning. Its message may grow tiring to some adult viewers after a while, but it has a nice pace that should keep most viewers interested, along with creative animation and bizarre situations! Sure, it's yet another story that feels in some ways like a ""Wizard of Oz"" retread, but it's different enough to be worthwhile.

Chuck Jones has created a real bona fide classic which ought to be shared by ALL age groups as well as cartoon fanatics like myself.  (That is, whether or not you have kids in both the former and latter.)Having first seen this at the age of 13, I must admit, I couldn't help feeling perplexed when I saw the first few minutes of the movie: bored, pessimistic little Milo making his way home from school, then finds a magical tollbooth popping up in his bedroom.  Once he enters it, he finds out he's become a cartoon character, then wondering into an alternate cartoon universe with a crazy patrol officer constantly repeating the word ""guilty"" and little lethargic amoeba-like creatures called ""doldrums"".  Since I was watching this on TV, so much of it freaked me out so bad I flipped to another channel.  Now let's fast forward to the age of 26......and now I'm actually ENJOYING IT!  Having been a lifelong Looney Toons fan myself, this movie IS a refreshing break from the usual fare of Bugs, Daffy, and Marvin the Martian.  The unique style of animation as well as the psychedelic colors/Picasso-like backgrounds were BOTH timeless and way ahead of its time (especially since it was made in 1968).  Besides, now that I've seen it in its entirety, it is pretty fun and enjoyable to watch as Milo embarks on a journey with Tock the Watchdog and the Humbug to rescue the princesses of rhyme and reason.  Their disappearance has created nothing but confusion and despair over a magical land full of words, letters, and numbers coming to life.The bottom line on the Phantom Tollbooth: if you want to see non-Looney Toons works of Chuck Jones and still enjoy classic children's TV/movies, like Captain Kangaroo, Electric Company,Schoolhouse Rock, and Charlotte's Web, then THIS IS IT!  :-)",5,A CHUCK JONES ANIMATION CELEBRATION!  =-),1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,1803,"['What', 'say', 'Chuck', 'Jones', 'created', 'real', 'bona', 'fide', 'classic', 'ought', 'be', 'shared', 'ALL', 'age', 'groups', 'as', 'well', 'cartoon', 'fanatics', 'not', 'have', 'kids', 'former', 'latter', 'Having', 'first', 'seen', 'age', '13', 'must', 'admit', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'perplexed', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie', 'bored', 'pessimistic', 'little', 'Milo', 'making', 'way', 'home', 'school', 'then', 'magical', 'tollbooth', 'popping', 'up', 'bedroom', 'Once', 'out', 'become', 'cartoon', 'character', 'then', 'wondering', 'alternate', 'cartoon', 'universe', 'crazy', 'patrol', 'officer', 'constantly', 'repeating', 'word', 'guilty', 'little', 'lethargic', 'amoeba-like', 'creatures', 'called', 'doldrums', 'was', 'watching', 'TV', 'so', 'much', 'freaked', 'out', 'so', 'bad', 'flipped', 'channel', 'Now', 'let', 'fast', 'forward', 'age', '26', 'now', ""'m"", 'actually', 'ENJOYING', 'IT', 'Having', 'been', 'lifelong', 'Looney', 'Toons', 'fan', 'movie', 'refreshing', 'break', 'usual', 'fare', 'Bugs', 'Daffy', 'Marvin', 'Martian', 'unique', 'style', 'animation', 'as', 'well', 'psychedelic', 'colors/Picasso-like', 'backgrounds', 'were', 'BOTH', 'timeless', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'especially', 'was', 'made', '1968', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'entirety', 'pretty', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'Milo', 'journey', 'Tock', 'Watchdog', 'Humbug', 'rescue', 'princesses', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'disappearance', 'created', 'nothing', 'confusion', 'despair', 'magical', 'land', 'full', 'words', 'letters', 'numbers', 'coming', 'life.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'Phantom', 'Tollbooth', 'want', 'see', 'non-Looney', 'Toons', 'works', 'Chuck', 'Jones', 'still', 'enjoy', 'classic', 'children', 'TV/movies', 'Captain', 'Kangaroo', 'Electric', 'Company', 'Schoolhouse', 'Rock', 'Charlotte', 'Web', 'then', 'THIS', 'IT']",N/A

He is also the same boy that played in the 1960's TV series called The Munster's. His charachters name was Eddie Munster. Well anyway, this movie has lessons on words and numbers. There was a dispute about which was more important in this movie, words or numbers. It got resolved in the end. I am glad that it came out in the year 1970. It would be a shame if this movie was ruined by computer animation. I did like the artist depiction of Milo in this movie. The cartoon background was nice. And I also like how the screenwriter used a pun in this movie. Watch dog. The cartoon charachters dog was wearing a watch collar.

Very unusually for a children's book, I genuinely like the illustrations -- to the extent that I'd consider hanging a few on my wall. It's a distinctive book, and it has hugely valuable object lessons for children. So I had high expectations, paying to see it in a theater. They were completely dashed. The animation is weak standard fare -- a cold shock, compared to the excellence of the book illustrations. The book in some way cleverly holds the narrative together, the movie is a bunch of disjointed, cheezy, cheap cartoon shots. Director Chuck Jones did the same thing to Walt Kelly's ""Pogo"" -- enraging Kelly to such an extent that Kelly took control of the next Pogo film. Jones is a myopic Hollywood talent, seeing only his vision. What is deep in the book is superficial in this movie.
