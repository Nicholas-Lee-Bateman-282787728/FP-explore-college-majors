Maybe both acting and directing were too much for him on film rather than on stage. Or maybe Miss Monroe, the consummate movie actress, was too instinctive and spontaneous for his formal, studied, exercise in self control. Ironically this was the conflict between the two main characters in the story, but on screen it only comes off as a confusion of acting styles as if they were in two different movies entirely, sinking the whole mess of a project once you begin to wonder just what does that showgirl see in this self absorbed mannequin after all?",2,MM can do no wrong/SLO can and does,1353542400,"11 22, 2012",2012,799,"['Elegantly', 'filmed', 'exquisitely', 'designed', 'costumed', 'Marilyn', 'full', 'life', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'ones', 'eyes', 'Sir', 'Lawrence', 'Olivier', 'missed', 'emotional', 'romantic', 'core', 'story', 'socio-eco-conflicted', 'starstruck', 'almost-lovers', 'Maybe', 'acting', 'directing', 'were', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'rather', 'stage', 'maybe', 'Miss', 'Monroe', 'consummate', 'movie', 'actress', 'was', 'too', 'instinctive', 'spontaneous', 'formal', 'studied', 'exercise', 'self', 'control', 'Ironically', 'was', 'conflict', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'story', 'screen', 'only', 'off', 'confusion', 'acting', 'styles', 'were', 'two', 'different', 'movies', 'entirely', 'sinking', 'whole', 'mess', 'project', 'begin', 'wonder', 'just', 'what', 'showgirl', 'see', 'self', 'absorbed', 'mannequin']",N/A

I know that some considered her talent to be minimal, and it is true that she didn't possess the range that some actresses carry, but she was very good at what she did and she carved a niche for herself that was undeniable.  She understood how to sell herself, exploit herself even, but the truth of the matter was that she was playing a part, and she sold it 100%.  Watching this film for the first time after seeing `My Week With Marilyn' was a particular treat because I feel like I (to a certain degree) got a behind the scenes look at the film itself and so watching the rapport that developed between Monroe and Olivier onscreen after the tumultuous time they had behind the screen is quite compelling.  Despite the hardships she was undergoing in the process, Monroe is dynamic in her role as showgirl Elsie.The film itself is rather silly and overworked and unbalanced and just not wholly interesting, dragging in particular segments and leaving me kind of blas&eacute; to the whole endeavor, but Monroe chews up her scenes with such rabid devotion.  Her comedic timing is stellar and her seductive nature is fully intact, but she always layers Elsie with a heart and soul, especially in the film's final moments.  Her coolness is alluring and she certainly makes the biggest impact here.  Olivier, as respected an actor as he was, can't hold his own against her and winds up becoming a caricature and a baffling presence as he muddles through the nonsensical plot, but Monroe shines brightly and walks away unscathed.It's a pretty picture, with top notch costumes and sets, but outside of Monroe there really isn't much reason to see this.",2,The showgirl walks away with the whole thing...,1346284800,"08 30, 2012",2012,1765,"['one', 'thing', 'took', 'away', 'Prince', 'Showgirl', 'was', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'actress', 'know', 'considered', 'talent', 'be', 'minimal', 'true', 'did', ""n't"", 'possess', 'range', 'actresses', 'carry', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'did', 'carved', 'niche', 'herself', 'was', 'undeniable', 'understood', 'how', 'sell', 'even', 'truth', 'matter', 'was', 'was', 'playing', 'part', 'sold', '100', '%', 'Watching', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'seeing', 'Week', 'Marilyn', 'was', 'particular', 'treat', 'feel', 'certain', 'degree', 'got', 'scenes', 'look', 'film', 'so', 'watching', 'rapport', 'developed', 'Monroe', 'Olivier', 'onscreen', 'tumultuous', 'time', 'had', 'screen', 'quite', 'compelling', 'hardships', 'was', 'undergoing', 'process', 'Monroe', 'dynamic', 'role', 'showgirl', 'Elsie.The', 'film', 'rather', 'silly', 'overworked', 'unbalanced', 'just', 'not', 'wholly', 'interesting', 'dragging', 'particular', 'segments', 'leaving', 'kind', 'blas', 'eacute', 'whole', 'endeavor', 'Monroe', 'up', 'scenes', 'such', 'rabid', 'devotion', 'comedic', 'timing', 'stellar', 'seductive', 'nature', 'fully', 'intact', 'always', 'layers', 'Elsie', 'heart', 'soul', 'especially', 'film', 'final', 'moments', 'coolness', 'alluring', 'certainly', 'biggest', 'impact', 'here', 'Olivier', 'respected', 'actor', 'was', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'own', 'up', 'becoming', 'caricature', 'baffling', 'presence', 'nonsensical', 'plot', 'Monroe', 'shines', 'brightly', 'walks', 'away', 'unscathed.It', 'pretty', 'picture', 'top', 'notch', 'costumes', 'sets', 'Monroe', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'reason', 'see']",N/A

Though the two lack any kind of rapport, the movie does hold some  charms with it's lush period design and lovely musical score by Richard Addinsell.  Jack Cardiff's photography is exceptional too.  The story is based on the not-too-successful play ""The Sleeping Prince"" by Terence Rattigan, in which Olivier had starred on Broadway (opposite Barbara Bel Geddes) where it only played for 60 performances.  The story is simple.  Olivier plays the womanising Grand Duke of Carpathia, visiting London,  who becomes entraced by an American actress, Elsie Marina (Marilyn Monroe).  Elsie is invited to the palace for a nightcap, and ends up staying for an eventful weekend, becoming entangled in the royal goings-on.Amusing, if not forgettable fare.  Monroe and Olivier give their best in the lead roles though this can't count among their best work.  Some fine support is provided by Sybil Thorndike, Richard Wattis, Jeremy Spenser, Esmond Knight, Rosamund Greenwood, Jean Kent, Gillian Owen and Paul Hardwick.The DVD presents the movie in a full-frame transfer.

234170,A1EOLRV216BXJ9,6300269256,Classic Movie watcher,"[3, 3]","I find this to be the movie in which Marylin Monroe is the most beautifully among the many movies she made. A comedy this is for sure and Marylin Monroe has made it hilarious with her signature innocent look. She is totally convincing as the nobody who caught the attention of the Duke (Lawrence Olivier), the one who could offend him, tease him yet could get away unsrcathed.As with the plays and movies Lawrence Olivier made (Richard III, Hamlet etc.), this movie wowed the audience with its magnficent, luxurious set and props. Even the reception ball at the Ambassy was down to the finest detail. And the witty diaglogue between Mariyln Monroe, the Duke, his son guaranteed that this is not a no sense comedy. The ending is clever, romantic yet realistic.And the greatest achievement of Lawrence Olivier (actor and director of the movie) was to choose Marylin Monroe for the role. Under his guidance (how difficult it is to achieve behind the scenes!), he has made Marilyn Monroe shine with wit, mischief, innocence in this movie like nowhere else before. Here Monroe has inner beauty to match with her lovely big screen shots. The credits must all go to the director.I also agree with other reviewers that Monroe even outshined Olivier in many scenes. This made the movie even more intriguing to watch - to be able to admire qualities of Monroe you can't see elsewhere; to be convinced on screen that it's Marilyn's character who transformed the Prince from a hard-hearted dictator to a romantic passionate man and not the other way round.

234174,A34S9VKRDJJL0H,6300269256,Donald A. Newlove,"[69, 71]","I've seen this film perhaps twenty times since it came out in 1957 and find the glowing DVD version perfection, much better than the laserdisk.When I first saw it, I believe it was projected through a lens masked for widescreen. So I was disappointed through the years when the videocassette and laserdisk versions weren't in widescreen. Now I'm delighted that the DVD isn't in widescreen, since the show was shot in standard format and we get almost the whole negative image on screen, with only a shot or two faintly cramped or with a figure not quite as fully seen as it was meant to be. No such worry about MM though, no image of her gets trimmed: the magnificent ballgown she's poured into becomes a character in itself. For me, this is MM's greatest performance just as ""Camille"" is Garbo's. In ""Camille"" you never catch Garbo acting, every line feels tossed off or thrown away except the big ones, which get the full heartcry the script calls for. In MM's film her every line flows from her with an assurance she matched only in ""Bus Stop"" and never feels acted. Inge's ""Bus Stop"", aside frin MM's scenes, strikes me as far less interesting than Rattigan's neatly built comedy, whose scenes without MM retain strong interest both because of the script and of Olivier's hand for detail and grip on staging. Also, Jack Cardiff fills the screen with glowing color to match the decor and costumes and much of my delight lies in having the full screen aglow, wall to wall and top to bottom with luscious light--light focused often on MM's sheer glory. Olivier's line readings are great fun, a grotesque joy, but MM reads like an angel and steals the show with her heartfelt method realism. What can one say about her that isn't less than she deserves here?For the horrors behind the filming, you might turn to Colin Clark's ""The Prince, the Showgirl, and Me: Six Months on the Set with Marilyn and Olivier"" (St. Martin's Press, $20.95) where this angel's neuroses are revealed in full. And yet Sybil Thordyke, her costar here as the Queen Mother, said of MM during the shooting that MM was the only one on the set who knew how to act on film and be natural. The crew often thought she wasn't acting--until the rushes starte showing up. Colin Clark himself (he's the son of art historian Kenneth Clark, was Olivier's gofer on the set, and later helped establish NYC's PBS station Channel 13) said that when the film was done, despite the endless agony everyone had working with her, MM was ""a force of nature"" onscreen, although the whole crew threw her wrap party's gifts into the garbage. Yes, one must admit that MM had more serious flaws than we the still living. But do we take issue with the model for Velazquez's gorgeous Venus in ""The Toilet of Venus"" (who may have been a waitress he hired) whose long bare body and glorious behind have the same pale rosiness as MM's skin under Cardiff's lighting, while Cardiff treats her hair and eyes and mouth, her bottom and her bitty little belly, with all the care of Velazquez. We no longer remember Velazquez's model but that painting of her captures the eternal feminine. And someday MM's Elsie Marina in this film will rise in the heavens of art and be remembered while MM becomes a receding historical figure, like Pola Negri the Vamp whose dark eyes once spilled their eroticism over the planet, and just as Garbo the unread rather brainless woman fades farther from view every year while her Marguerite Gautier in ""Camille"" remains a  serene image of artistic divinity.As a footnote, let me add that all the actors are superb, as is the score. I was so delighted by the score (not to mention MM's sweet singing) in 1957 that I wrote a fan letter to Richard Addinsell, the composer (best-known for his ""Warsaw Concerto"") and he wrote back about his thankfulness to Olivier for his not asking him for ""music by the yard,"" as was the custom when Addinsell wrote film music for others, but rather allowed him to let go and write every note from the heart. That music adds no little lift of pleasure to the images--and to MM and Olivier's big waltz scene at the ball.

234183,A2HIWDD2TDXS19,6300269256,F. Gentile,"[13, 25]","I rate this the most un-interesting of all of Marilyns roles. As a devoted & lifelong M.M. fan, this is the only one of her films that I've only gotten through twice. The first time, just to see it, the second time, to see if I was possibly mistaken in my negative appraisal of it. I wasn't. While Marilyn is certainly at her most etherally beautiful, this film was destined for failure from the beginning. The notorious pairing of Monroe with Laurence Olivier was a mis-calculation from its inception. It is obvious that Olivier needed a ""commercial"" hit movie at that point in his career, and, while his wife, Vivien Leigh, had originated the role of Elsie Marina on stage, Marilyn Monroe Productions bought the rights to ""The Sleeping Prince"", its original title. Also, Marilyn at that time was a highly commercial draw, and her name with Oliviers would be more of a guarantee of box office dollars (they thought.) It soon became obvious what everyone suspected, that Olivier did not respect and was secretly humiliated by a co-starring role with Americas notorious sex symbol. Also, it was reported that, because this was being produced by M.M. Productions, she was literally in an ""in- charge"" position, which equally humiliated him.  In ""The Noel Coward Diaries"", Noel Coward, a good friend of Oliviers, expressed the general snobbish opinion when he writes, in the year 1956, that starring with Monroe was a humiliating but commercially necessary decision for Olivier, and ""to hell with eminence"", a barely disguised aspersion on Marilyn. Her arrival in England was met with an immediate press conference, where she was condescendingly queried as to what her favorite Beethoven numbers were, and, how long did she think a whale could stay under water ??, the implications being obvious.  To add to all the pressure and high expectations of such a pairing, M.M. had recently wed Arthur Miller, immersing her in a highly intellectual world, where the insecure Marilyn, though naturally bright and intuitive, was ill equipped to always hold her own. The fact that Olivier was also hired by Marilyn to direct this film didn't help, and his comment to Marilyn  near the beginning of the shoot, ""Okay, Marilyn..Be sexy!"", was an obvious assumption as to where Olivier thought Marilyns only true talent lie, and only served to undermine her already shaky confidence. The ""most exciting combination since black and white !"", as Joshua Logan deemed this collaboration , went from bad to worse, with Olivier detesting Marilyns growing insecurities, and what he viewed as her unprofessionalism. He also hated ""The Method"", the acting style which M.M. had been influenced by in her continuing studies at The Actors Studio. By the time this film wrapped, everyone involved was barely on speaking terms, and Marilyns exit from England was the opposite of the fan fare she confronted upon her arrival. The movie was almost universally panned upon release, with many noting the obvious lack of chemistry between the principals. Oddly enough, Olivier was surprised with a screening of this film , many years after its filming, and Marilyns death, as a joke by friends of his. They were all surprisingly unaminous in their appraisal after its viewing, as Olivier wrote: ""Everyone was clamorous in their praises, I was as good as could be...and Marilyn! Marilyn was quite wonderful, the best of all. So...what do you know ?""  Be that as it may, I still rate this the least interesting of her roles... she was not respected  before her arrival to film this movie, or in the environment created around her during its filming,  and it shows. It does no service, I feel, to her brilliant career, except as a further visual testament to her beauty. Even that is not enough for me to sit through this laborious mistake again. To see M.M. at her magical best, watch ""Bus Stop"", ""Some Like It Hot"", or ""The Misfits.""",2,The Prince... The Showgirl...

It's true, this bizarre match actually took place in the 1957 film, The Prince and the Showgirl. The story takes place at the 1911 coronation of King George V of England. Olivier plays a decorous Carpathian prince, who attends the coronation with his son, the young King, and the dowager queen. When the eye of his son is snagged by Marilyn the showgirl, the Prince arranges for them to meet, and she attends the coronation with them. The prince, of course, is utterly charmed by her. Olivier served as director, producer, and leading man in this film, which he adapted from a play by Terence Ratigan. Monroe had recently demonstrated her considerable acting talents the year before in Bus Stop, and this role was somewhat unworthy of those. Nevertheless, she took the part of ""naive"" showgirl and invested it with her brilliant comedic timing, maintaining a sort of tongue in cheek bearing that implied that the joke was certainly not on her. Why an actor of Olivier's stature would choose the role of the wooden prince is a mystery. (Probably he merely wanted to work with the blonde bombshell.) The film that he produced and directed turned out to be sluggishly paced, and the movie fails to achieve the snap and crackle that it might have reached with a livelier director.

MM stays in the same dress for all of the movie. Why would they not dress her in various clothes? Her stomach also looks big from the side in her dress. MM is not very charming in this for me. I can't put my finger on it, but her performance is not very cute. With this character, she just seems, not even dumb, but retarded & simple most of the time. The plot makes no sense. They are supposed to fall in love & it takes forever for them to finally be serious & show that they like one another. It does not even seem they like one another; like they're only flirting with one another. Guess that explains why MM's biographers say there was no chemistry between her & Sir Larry. The movie seems very absract & disconnected. It never quite pulls itself together. I think what makes the movie boring is they go over & over the same thing. MM always seems to be finally leaving his house, but then comes back. And every time she's about to leave, she wants him to pin the badge he gave her on her dress. But this keeps happening again & again & that's what makes this trite! I really think that MM & Olivier gave great performances.

Marilyn Monroe plays Elsie Marina, a showgirl with an annoying laugh who appears ditsy yet is really clever and witty. Lawrence Olivier plays some kind of future prince who meets Elsie at a showclub and decides to invite her up to his room to seduce her. Of course, the prince is cold and uncompassionate, and as Elsie says, ""Lacks love in his life"". Unfazed by his charms (or lack of) she resists him but ends up spending the night at his place (albeit in a seperate room). The prince becomes unfuriated at this clever lady and has several unncessary bursts of outrage that are supposed to be funny but aren't. The most interesting part of the plot is when Elsie overhears the Prince's son talking on the phone in German, planning to overthrow his father so he can obtain the crown sooner. After that, there is the promise the plot may pick up but it doesn't. Elsie gets to ride in a chariot with the Prince & other royals because one of the women has fallen ill, which makes the storyline even more unrealistic than it is. Then there is the long coronation ceremony that is tediously drawn out, causing viewers to become bored to tears. Most of the time during the coronation ceremony the cameras are fixated either on Monroe's face or stain glass windows. After this, the plot drags on some more but as we see in the end, Elsie somehow manages to fix an agreement between the Prince and his son, and earns the respect of the Prince all in the next hour. This movie is around 2 1/2 hours long but felt more like 3 1/2. I actually became anxious for it to end. This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen aside from 'War and Peace' although 'War and Peace' actually became interesting after the first hour. This movie had the opposite effect: it started out interesting but went downhill from there. Sure Monroe looks beautiful in this, but is her beauty enough to give this five stars? This movie along with 'Bus Stop' was supposed to show Monroe could be a dramatic actress. And while she does show a bit more range than her previous films, it's nothing to write home about. A charismatic actress who picked forgettable film roles.

Olivier is the pompous regent of Carpathia, visiting England for the coronation of King George in 1911.  On a tour of one of London's theaters he meets a young dancer named Elsie Marina (Monroe).  He invites her back to his embassy for a little dinner and who knows what.  She gets tipsy and ends up spending the night, albeit in a separate bedroom.  Hey, it's 1957.Monroe has a couple delicious scenes giving the viewer a sense of her comedic timing.  Writer Colin Clark's memoir of the time suggests Monroe was in a deep depression and was constantly late on set as well as unprepared.  This may account for Olivier's - who also directed - ham-fisted staging.  I suspect he had his hands full.Dame Sybil Thorndike plays the Queen Dowager, the Grand Duke's (Olivier) mother-in-law and she's a peach.  Formal but funny and who becomes an ally of the American Elsie, who is clearly a fish out of water.  Although Elsie falls for the Duke, it's not evident by the performances as to why.

And while her performance does show a broader range than her previous characterizations, and she is almost unbelievably luminous here, the film is disapointingly slow and not very compelling. I've never showed it to anyone that wanted to watch it through to the end. The problem seems to lie in the script; the storyline is talky and static and too devoid of physical action to keep from sagging over the long running time. It probably worked better as a stage play. However, it is a must for fans of Marilyn for her ethereal beauty alone. And to her credit, her artful performance makes one wish she had better material to work with. I'm not sure she ever played any role as clear headed as her Elsie Marina (""Something's Got To Give""--had it been finished, would have rivalled it) and it is refreshing to see her  playing someone who is not in a kind of stupor for once. While ""Prince and the Showgirl"" was not a success, it does prove Monroe's range and acting abilities were greater than anyone probably suspected.

I'm not alone in thinking this was Monroe's best performance, Her timing alone was a miracle, no matter how many takes it took her to get there.

234222,A65XH6L5BUX0X,6300269256,"TheClassicsNut65 ""morgan miller""","[1, 2]","""The Prince and the Showgirl"" is a 1957 British-American romantic comedy film starring Marilyn Monroe and Sir Laurence Olivier.I must first clear that I only purchased this film because Miss Monroe was in it and because she was the lead. ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" was Monroe's first film away from 20th Century-Fox, and the first (and only) film ever produced under Marilyn Monroe Productions, Inc. The film was shot in England in late 1956, a time in which Monroe had just garnered critical acclaim for her performance in ""Bus Stop"" (1956), and a time when she was ranking 7th at the box office. I must stress that I was shocked at what little (and I repeat little) ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" had to offer a viewer: We get it... he wants her, but she really doesn't want him, or at first at least! Correct? In total I have watched maybe 35 or 40 minutes of this film and during that entire nothing much happened. My only enjoyment was to see Miss Monroe from the beginning of the film to ...whenever... I took it out. It just didn't ""click"" with me I guess, because it was ""slow-moving"" I suppose.The only thing that I don't understand was that when this film was released on June 13, 1957, reviews were excellent; especially for Monroe and Olivier's performances. Even the royalty of England gave the film A+ reviews. ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" wasn't, however, favored among audiences. It made just $1.5 million at the United States box office and only $4,300,000 in total, making it the lowest-earning Monroe film in nearly five years. It still, however, becam the 12th highest-grossing film of 1957, ranking directly behind ""Jailhouse Rock"" starring Elvis Presley, and directly ahead of ""Jeanne Eagles"", starring Kim Novak.***So to sum up my review... this film is OK I suppose. It has a mild, somewhat uninteresting, and meaningless plot; but with good actors (Monroe and Olivier). I'm just afraid there's not much here... Sorry Marilyn! I love you and (most of) your films. Give it a try I guess... I try that may turn out to be a mistake!",3,"Monroe's first ""indie"" film...
