700496,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000065V3H,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[2, 2]","As I plan to head back into the 80's with occassional reviews that I plan on doing, I came across this 1987 film that I was never overly familiar with, but I remember seeing way back when. It was never in the group of ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", or ""Sixteen Candles"", ""The Breakfast Club"", or ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" for me, and after having now seen it for the first time since the 80's, still isn't, but that's okay. It doesn't have to be. It's a fine little film all on it's own. So, what's the plot?....Patrick Dempsey(who is pretty much known as ""McDreamy"" nowadays)plays Ronald Miller, a 17 year high school kid who mows people's lawns over the summer. Ronald is not one of the cool kids. Hangs with the ""loser"" crowd, has glasses, unruly hair, etc. For years, he has had a crush on the most popular girl in school(of course he did)named Cindy Mancini(Amanda Peterson, and who wouldn't when your as adorable as Amanda?). When Cindy finds herself in a jam, Ronald swoops in to the rescue....but at a price. He wants Cindy to hang with him for a month and act like they are an item, in hopes of making himself more popular at school and getting to belong with the cool, popular kids. The plan goes into motion and works, but maybe it works a little too well, and Ronald will soon have to come to realize what's more important - being somebody your not to belong, or being liked and accepted for who you are.Plot-wise, ""Can't Buy Me Love"" is not exactly original, but what makes it work is that it is performed sweetly, naturally, and honestly. You see what happens to Ronald and how it touches everyone around him, for better or worse. One of the best aspects is his relationship with his best friend, played by Courtney Gains, and the lows that come with it once Ronald becomes popular. Their confrontation in the video arcade is affective. Most of the cast are 80's types, but it's two main stars, Patrick Dempsey and Amanda Peterson, bring sweet life to the characters that helps make it's plot less obvious. Okay, it's obvious, but they make it likeable and watchable. Dempsey does a great job as geeky Ronald, popular Ronald, and back to geeky Ronald. We like him and feel sorry for him in the start, and then are shocked and disgusted with him and the way he acts and treats others when he becomes one of the ""cool kids"", and then it's back to liking him again and wanting him to have what he wants when the old geekster comes back to the forefront. Amanda Peterson is the popular girl, but she plays it with a sweetness that never makes Cindy Mancini a nasty caricature of these types of characters - Popluar captain of the cheerleading team with her own little clique. Life isn't exactly a bouquet of roses for her either. The two of them, and their characters, really make the film. Elsewhere, you will find a young Seth Green(""Buffy"", ""Austin Powers"") as Ronald's little brother, Chuckie. He's a hoot in the role. Ronald's father is played by Dennis Dugan, who went on to become a successful comedy director, having filmed a lot of of Adam Sandler's films.What's not to like about the movie?. Not much. ""Can't Buy Me Love"" won't win any awards for originality, and that's probably the only big thing going against it. For most of the movie, it never delved into cheesiness, until the end. Ronald's final speech outside in the cafeteria bringing the ""cool"" and the ""not so cool"" kids together gets washed away with a little too much cheese with big, sweeping music played as it goes along, but this can be overlooked when you have such a charming little movie played very well by it's two main stars. I love the 80's. Some see the dated fashions and everything else as a detriment to these films, but that couldn't be further from the truth. It enhances the movie and helps make it what it is. It only adds to the charm.At the end of the day, ""Can't Buy Me Love"" is a pleasant, harmless, little comedy, that has grown over the years into a real teen/high school classic for a lot of people. No, Ronald, you can't buy love, but you can achieve it by staying true to who you are.",3,"Cards, Chips, Dips And Dorks",1242000000,"05 11, 2009",2009,4097,"['plan', 'head', 'back', '80', 'occassional', 'reviews', 'plan', 'doing', 'came', '1987', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'overly', 'familiar', 'remember', 'seeing', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'never', 'group', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Day', 'Off', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'having', 'now', 'seen', 'first', 'time', '80', 'still', ""n't"", 'okay', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'fine', 'little', 'film', 'own', 'So', 'what', 'plot', '.Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'known', 'McDreamy', 'nowadays', 'Ronald', 'Miller', '17', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'who', 'people', 'lawns', 'summer', 'Ronald', 'not', 'one', 'cool', 'kids', 'Hangs', 'loser', 'crowd', 'glasses', 'unruly', 'hair', 'etc', 'years', 'had', 'crush', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', 'course', 'did', 'named', 'Cindy', 'Mancini', 'Amanda', 'Peterson', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'when', 'as', 'adorable', 'Amanda', 'When', 'Cindy', 'jam', 'Ronald', 'rescue', '.but', 'price', 'Cindy', 'hang', 'month', 'act', 'are', 'item', 'hopes', 'making', 'more', 'popular', 'school', 'getting', 'belong', 'cool', 'popular', 'kids', 'plan', 'motion', 'works', 'maybe', 'little', 'too', 'well', 'Ronald', 'will', 'soon', 'have', 'come', 'realize', 'what', 'more', 'important', 'being', 'somebody', 'not', 'belong', 'being', 'liked', 'accepted', 'who', 'are.Plot-wise', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'Me', 'Love', 'not', 'exactly', 'original', 'what', 'work', 'performed', 'sweetly', 'naturally', 'honestly', 'see', 'what', 'Ronald', 'how', 'everyone', 'better', 'worse', 'One', 'best', 'aspects', 'relationship', 'best', 'friend', 'played', 'Courtney', 'Gains', 'lows', 'come', 'once', 'Ronald', 'popular', 'confrontation', 'video', 'arcade', 'affective', 'Most', 'cast', 'are', '80', 'types', 'two', 'main', 'stars', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'Amanda', 'Peterson', 'bring', 'sweet', 'life', 'characters', 'helps', 'make', 'plot', 'less', 'obvious', 'Okay', 'obvious', 'make', 'likeable', 'watchable', 'Dempsey', 'great', 'job', 'geeky', 'Ronald', 'popular', 'Ronald', 'back', 'geeky', 'Ronald', 'like', 'feel', 'sorry', 'start', 'then', 'are', 'shocked', 'disgusted', 'way', 'treats', 'others', 'when', 'one', 'cool', 'kids', 'then', 'back', 'liking', 'again', 'wanting', 'have', 'what', 'when', 'old', 'geekster', 'back', 'forefront', 'Amanda', 'Peterson', 'popular', 'girl', 'sweetness', 'never', 'Cindy', 'Mancini', 'nasty', 'caricature', 'types', 'characters', 'Popluar', 'captain', 'cheerleading', 'team', 'own', 'little', 'clique', 'Life', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'bouquet', 'roses', 'either', 'two', 'characters', 'really', 'make', 'film', 'Elsewhere', 'will', 'find', 'young', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Buffy', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'Ronald', 'little', 'brother', 'Chuckie', 'hoot', 'role', 'Ronald', 'father', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Dugan', 'who', 'went', 'become', 'successful', 'comedy', 'director', 'having', 'filmed', 'lot', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'films.What', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'Not', 'much', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'Me', 'Love', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', 'originality', 'probably', 'only', 'big', 'thing', 'going', 'most', 'movie', 'never', 'delved', 'cheesiness', 'end', 'Ronald', 'final', 'speech', 'cafeteria', 'bringing', 'cool', 'not', 'so', 'cool', 'kids', 'together', 'washed', 'away', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'cheese', 'big', 'sweeping', 'music', 'played', 'along', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'when', 'have', 'charming', 'little', 'movie', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'two', 'main', 'stars', 'love', '80', 'see', 'dated', 'fashions', 'everything', 'else', 'detriment', 'films', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'movie', 'make', 'what', 'only', 'charm.At', 'end', 'day', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'Me', 'Love', 'pleasant', 'harmless', 'little', 'comedy', 'grown', 'years', 'real', 'teen/high', 'school', 'classic', 'lot', 'people', 'No', 'Ronald', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'love', 'can', 'achieve', 'staying', 'true', 'who', 'are']",N/A

Can't Buy Me Love suffers from an identity crisis very similar to Dempsey's. Does the film stay true to its original premise and do something more meaningful & more considered or does it sell out to be more marketable? Unfortunately, the film goes with the latter.Watching Can't Buy Me Love, I could see there was a good film just beneath the surface. Amanda Peterson's character and the object of Dempsey's affections, stars as the most popular girl in school. She hates it. Popularity is more like a job to her. Her friends are superficial. Everyone treats her like an object. No one can really see the real her. These are interesting ideas that could have made for a very intriguing film. Peterson seems game as she has a solid grasp on her character and what makes her tick, but these story elements are only scratched upon and not fully explored.

There was the remake of ""Wanted: Dead Or Alive"", ""Stakeout"", ""Adventures In Babysitting"", and then this one. These were all losers because they had a shallow plot, a lack of talented actors/actresses, and no moral fiber to them whatsoever. With ""Wanted"" every 2 seconds there was swearing, ""Stakeout"" was just plain stupid, ""Adventures In Babysitting"" showed me that the young were starting to yell back at authority, and this one what people will do to be noticed and accepted in the popular group.

When Ronald Miller (Patrick Demsey) pays Cyndi Mancini (Amanda Peterson), the most popular girl in high school, a thousand dollars to date him for one month, he's not trying to buy her love.  He's trying to buy her popularity.And he succeeds.However, popularity isn't as glamorous as Ronald expected it to be.  He learns from Cyndi that being popular can feel like a job sometimes.  Even Cyndi Mancini, the most popular girl in school, still has to work at being popular or even she, too, can be cast out.  But despite Cyndi's warnings to Ronald not to lose his authentic self trying to impress this crowd, Ronald nevertheless does...and ends up betraying a good friend in the process.The acting in this movie is pretty good.  Demsey and Peterson both give convincing performances, but I was also impressed by the actor who played Ronald's best friend (the redhead from ""Children of the Corn"").  The confrontation scene in the arcade was pretty explosive.I also enjoyed Seth Green's performance as Ronald's annoying younger brother Chucky.  Chucky is a pest who enjoys being a pest.  The funniest scene in the movie is when Chucky asks Ronald -- right in front of their parents -- where Ronald's report card is...knowing full well that Ronald flunked all his classes.The scene that didn't work for me, though, was the scene where Ronald confronts the stereotypical jock bully and gives him and the whole class a moving sermon that enlightens them all.  In this scene, the bully patiently listens to Ronald's sermon, but in reality, a bully would've probably either punched Ronald in the mouth or walked away before Ronald could finish.Another problem with this movie is when Cyndi rages against the popular crowd and yet, not only does she return back to them, but she's also accepted back by them, too.Overall, though, this is a good movie that's not really about buying love, but rather about selling your soul to become popular.",4,The price of popularity,1288569600,"11 1, 2010",2010,2049,"['Reading', 'title', 'might', 'assume', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'warning', 'trying', 'buy', 'someone', 'love', 'not', 'When', 'Ronald', 'Miller', 'Patrick', 'Demsey', 'Cyndi', 'Mancini', 'Amanda', 'Peterson', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'high', 'school', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'date', 'one', 'month', 'not', 'trying', 'buy', 'love', 'trying', 'buy', 'popularity.And', 'succeeds.However', 'popularity', ""n't"", 'as', 'glamorous', 'Ronald', 'expected', 'be', 'Cyndi', 'being', 'popular', 'can', 'feel', 'job', 'sometimes', 'Even', 'Cyndi', 'Mancini', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', 'still', 'work', 'being', 'popular', 'even', 'too', 'can', 'be', 'cast', 'out', 'Cyndi', 'warnings', 'Ronald', 'not', 'lose', 'authentic', 'self', 'trying', 'impress', 'crowd', 'Ronald', 'nevertheless', 'up', 'betraying', 'good', 'friend', 'process.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'Demsey', 'Peterson', 'give', 'convincing', 'performances', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Ronald', 'best', 'friend', 'redhead', 'Children', 'Corn', 'confrontation', 'scene', 'arcade', 'was', 'pretty', 'explosive.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Seth', 'Green', 'performance', 'Ronald', 'annoying', 'younger', 'brother', 'Chucky', 'Chucky', 'pest', 'who', 'being', 'pest', 'funniest', 'scene', 'movie', 'when', 'Chucky', 'Ronald', 'right', 'front', 'parents', 'where', 'Ronald', 'report', 'card', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'Ronald', 'flunked', 'classes.The', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'though', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'Ronald', 'stereotypical', 'jock', 'bully', 'whole', 'class', 'moving', 'sermon', 'scene', 'bully', 'patiently', 'Ronald', 'sermon', 'reality', 'bully', 'would', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'either', 'punched', 'Ronald', 'mouth', 'walked', 'away', 'Ronald', 'could', 'finish.Another', 'problem', 'movie', 'when', 'Cyndi', 'popular', 'crowd', 'yet', 'not', 'only', 'return', 'back', 'also', 'accepted', 'back', 'too.Overall', 'though', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'buying', 'love', 'rather', 'selling', 'soul', 'become', 'popular']",N/A

Ronny Miller (Patrick Dempsey) is a nerdish grass-cutter going into his senior year in high school. He has a yearning to join the 'popular clique,' and hook-up with its head beauty, Cindy Mancini (Amanda Peterson), a seemingly shallow cheerleader who lives next door to Ronny without hardly a glance in his direction. When Cindy ruins her mother's suede outfit at a party, she is desperate to replace the very expensive clothing. Enter Ronny, who offers to bail her out monetarily, on one condition - date him for a month at school. Ronny believes this will get him in with the popular crowd, and put him together with Cindy. She grudgingly agrees, and for a month, it seems to work. Ronny works his way up the social ladder, and Cindy opens up to him, revealing a not-so-shallow person underneath that beauty. She even starts to fall for our hero. Unfortunately, the quest for popularity has overshadowed his quest for the girl's heart, and he sacrifices her affections and his old 'nerd herd' friends for his new-found hipness. The picture proceeds to chronicle Ronny's rise (and fall) as the King of Hip, and Cindy's journey into maturity.This is a fun film, though the message (Be yourself) does come off a bit heavy-handed. Most of the characters are one-noted. Dempsey puts in a great performance in one of his earlier roles as Ronny, who puts everything on the line for his shot at popularity. Peterson puts in a wonderful, natural turn as Cindy, who rises out of the shallow end of the popular pool to become a better person. A young Seth Green (Oz, 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer) turns in a spirited role as Ronny's brother Chuckie, and Courtney Gains is great as Ronny's put-upon and nearly-forgotten best friend Kenny. A highlight of the the film involves Ronny's dancing attempt at a high school mixer (He was watching National Geographic, not American Bandstand, while learning his moves). Paula Abdul choreographed the 'dance.'All in all, a wonderful film about finding yourself, and not judging or being friends with people based on what 'clique' they belong to.The DVD provides only Fullscreen, with Dolby Surround, but the film doesn't suffer from this form one bit.

After countless yards mowed, sacrificing even the remotest possibility of popularity, he's finally accumulated enough money to buy the telescope of his dreams.Meanwhile, Cindy Mancini (the gorgeous Amanda Peterson) is the hottest, coolest girl in school, the captain of the cheerleading squad, and pretty much the envy of everyone.  Men want her, and women want to be her.  At a ""back to school"" party she wears her mother's suede outfit.  Insert the dumb, clumsy jock with wine glass, and the outfit is ruined.  Later, when both Ron and Cindy end up at the mall - Cindy to replace the outfit and Ron to buy his telescope - the opportunity presents itself and Ron buy's his popularity.Predictably, some shades and a little hair mousse transport Ronald into the popularity stratosphere.  As one of Cindy's gorgeous but promiscuous friends says, ""He went from totally geek, to totally chic.""  Once part of the clique, he becomes arrogant, dips his pen in the cheerleader ink, and distances himself from his real friends, going so far as throwing feces on his best friend's house.  Tired of Ron's big head, Cindy breaks the bombshell at a crowded party, and drops Ronald from big man on campus to social leper.  Ron learns the valuable lessons that he should never sell out his friends or principles, and that notoriety isn't always the best thing in the world.I love this movie.  It's classic 80s, and wildly entertaining.  The only problem I have is that this should have propelled Amanda Peterson into superstardom, yet she was barely heard from afterwards.  There is no justice in a world that shuns Peterson and allows fugly shrews like Sarah Jessica Parker stardom.",5,"Cindy Mancini, where have you gone?!",1218153600,"08 8, 2008",2008,1818,"['One', 'biggest', 'dorks', 'school', 'Ronald', 'Miller', 'Dempsey', 'life', 'consumed', 'telescopes', 'astronomy', 'similarly', 'socially', 'awkward', 'friends', 'countless', 'yards', 'mowed', 'sacrificing', 'even', 'remotest', 'possibility', 'popularity', 'finally', 'accumulated', 'enough', 'money', 'buy', 'telescope', 'dreams.Meanwhile', 'Cindy', 'Mancini', 'gorgeous', 'Amanda', 'Peterson', 'hottest', 'coolest', 'girl', 'school', 'captain', 'cheerleading', 'squad', 'pretty', 'much', 'envy', 'everyone', 'Men', 'want', 'her', 'women', 'want', 'be', 'back', 'school', 'party', 'mother', 'suede', 'outfit', 'Insert', 'dumb', 'clumsy', 'jock', 'wine', 'glass', 'outfit', 'ruined', 'Later', 'when', 'Ron', 'Cindy', 'end', 'up', 'mall', 'Cindy', 'replace', 'outfit', 'Ron', 'buy', 'telescope', 'opportunity', 'Ron', 'buy', 'popularity.Predictably', 'shades', 'little', 'hair', 'mousse', 'transport', 'Ronald', 'popularity', 'stratosphere', 'one', 'Cindy', 'gorgeous', 'promiscuous', 'friends', 'went', 'totally', 'geek', 'totally', 'chic', 'part', 'clique', 'arrogant', 'pen', 'cheerleader', 'ink', 'distances', 'real', 'friends', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'throwing', 'feces', 'best', 'friend', 'house', 'Tired', 'Ron', 'big', 'head', 'Cindy', 'bombshell', 'crowded', 'party', 'drops', 'Ronald', 'big', 'man', 'campus', 'social', 'leper', 'Ron', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'should', 'never', 'sell', 'out', 'friends', 'principles', 'notoriety', ""n't"", 'always', 'best', 'thing', 'world.I', 'love', 'movie', 'classic', '80s', 'wildly', 'entertaining', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'propelled', 'Amanda', 'Peterson', 'superstardom', 'yet', 'was', 'barely', 'heard', 'afterwards', 'justice', 'world', 'Peterson', 'fugly', 'shrews', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'stardom']",N/A

This film is about Ronald Miller, a regular guy from Arizona who mows lawns and goes to High school.  One lawn in particular belongs to Cindy Mancini, the most popular girl in town,who does not even acknowledge Ronald's existence. Well, Cindy goes to a party wearing an expensive outfit that her mother forbade her to wear when she asked her.  One of the jocks gets careless with his red wine and throws it right onto Mancini's outfit.  Now, Cindy is in trouble when she can't get the stains out or a replacement dress.  Then, Ronald offers to pay for the dress if she goes out with him because he is certain that it will instantly make him the most popular guy in school and he is right.  But,when Ronald makes friends with the jocks his somewhat dorky ex-friends resent his ignoring them and Ronald eventually is pressured into throwing crap at his best friend's house on Halloween.  Then the best part of the movie comes, Ronald realizes that they were all friends when they were younger and gives a GREAT speech when one of the jocks get angry that a dork is tutoring one of the hot cheerleader chicks.  The jock says ""this guy is pulling a Ronald Miller"" and Ronald smashes a bat and admits that he changed as a person when he became popular.  After that, nobody thinks that Ronald is a Dork for what he did anymore and begin to feel his pain.

When you want a movie that is fun, easy on the brain, and still funny, then this movie is it.This movie is fable-lite, in that multiple morals are presented throughout the movie, but are somewhat camouflaged. Perhaps the biggest moral is that you should not be what you are not. Smaller, but no less important, morals might include knowing who your true friends are, friends stand by you when all others leave, love can not be purchased, and on and on.With all the morals presented in this teen fable, you might wonder whether I was joking about this being a light movie; not at all. The fable is presented in such a laid-back fashion that you may not realize that this movie is a fable.Patrick Dempsey is a classic nerd. He hangs out with his friends, equally nerdy, and plays cards (I am a nerd, I can say these things because I DID these things). Their idea of excitement is a new video game. Patrick loves astronomy. His friends generally believe academics in school are the most important thing they can do. Patrick has been mowing lawns nearly forever to buy a $1000 telescope.On the day that Patrick goes to buy the telescope, he sees beautiful Amanda Peterson trying to buy a suede jacket that has red wine spilled on it, to keep her mother from finding she borrowed it after her mother specifically told her not to borrow it. In a moment of insanity, Patrick Dempsey offers to give Amanda Peterson $1000 to buy the jacket if she will ""go out"" with him for 30 days. Even though Amanda thinks Patrick is crazy to think that everyone will think he is cool if he goes out with her for 30 days, buying a replacement suede jacket is more important than being seen with Patrick for 30 days, so she takes the deal.Of course, you realize that all this has to end up badly, but between the time that Amanda accepts the deal and the end of the movie, the viewer gets to see how shallow the difference is between geekdom and stardom, and how shallow the people are that determine which is which.This movie has a few outright laughs, and a lot of smiles and chuckles. However, it is a feel-good movie. The story is compelling and unless you are not paying attention, the story will suck you in. You stay because you want to know the outcome, and the story line is sufficiently interesting to hold your interest to the very end. In the event you haven't seen this movie, the ending is poignant, and worth the wait.This movie was one of the endless teen movies released in the 1980s. However, it has the distinction of being one of the funnier movies of the bunch. If you like light comedy, I strongly recommend this movie, even for young teens. While not award material, as entertainment this movie is excellent, and I give it five stars for being highly entertaining.",5,Funny Teen Fable,1046304000,"02 27, 2003",2003,2871,"['Sometimes', 'can', 'watch', 'too', 'many', 'dramas', 'too', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'serious', 'When', 'want', 'movie', 'fun', 'easy', 'brain', 'still', 'funny', 'then', 'movie', 'it.This', 'movie', 'fable-lite', 'multiple', 'morals', 'are', 'presented', 'movie', 'are', 'somewhat', 'camouflaged', 'Perhaps', 'biggest', 'moral', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'are', 'not', 'Smaller', 'less', 'important', 'morals', 'might', 'include', 'knowing', 'who', 'true', 'friends', 'are', 'friends', 'stand', 'when', 'others', 'leave', 'love', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'purchased', 'morals', 'presented', 'teen', 'fable', 'might', 'wonder', 'was', 'joking', 'being', 'light', 'movie', 'not', 'fable', 'presented', 'such', 'laid-back', 'fashion', 'may', 'not', 'realize', 'movie', 'fable.Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'classic', 'nerd', 'out', 'friends', 'equally', 'nerdy', 'plays', 'cards', 'am', 'nerd', 'can', 'say', 'things', 'DID', 'things', 'idea', 'excitement', 'new', 'video', 'game', 'Patrick', 'astronomy', 'friends', 'generally', 'believe', 'academics', 'school', 'are', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'can', 'do', 'Patrick', 'been', 'mowing', 'lawns', 'nearly', 'forever', 'buy', '1000', 'day', 'Patrick', 'buy', 'telescope', 'beautiful', 'Amanda', 'Peterson', 'trying', 'buy', 'suede', 'jacket', 'red', 'wine', 'spilled', 'keep', 'mother', 'finding', 'borrowed', 'mother', 'specifically', 'told', 'not', 'borrow', 'moment', 'insanity', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'give', 'Amanda', 'Peterson', '1000', 'buy', 'jacket', 'will', 'go', 'out', '30', 'days', 'Even', 'Amanda', 'Patrick', 'crazy', 'think', 'everyone', 'will', 'think', 'cool', 'out', '30', 'days', 'buying', 'replacement', 'suede', 'jacket', 'more', 'important', 'being', 'seen', 'Patrick', '30', 'days', 'deal.Of', 'course', 'realize', 'end', 'up', 'badly', 'time', 'Amanda', 'deal', 'end', 'movie', 'viewer', 'see', 'how', 'shallow', 'difference', 'geekdom', 'stardom', 'how', 'shallow', 'people', 'are', 'determine', 'which.This', 'movie', 'few', 'outright', 'laughs', 'lot', 'smiles', 'chuckles', 'However', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'story', 'compelling', 'are', 'not', 'paying', 'attention', 'story', 'will', 'suck', 'stay', 'want', 'know', 'outcome', 'story', 'line', 'sufficiently', 'interesting', 'hold', 'interest', 'very', 'end', 'event', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'ending', 'poignant', 'wait.This', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'endless', 'teen', 'movies', 'released', '1980s', 'However', 'distinction', 'being', 'one', 'funnier', 'movies', 'bunch', 'like', 'light', 'comedy', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'even', 'young', 'teens', 'not', 'award', 'material', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'excellent', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'being', 'highly', 'entertaining']",N/A

He also wishes to be invited to all the A list parties, be liked by others than his fellow nerds, and just be liked.  When the most popular girl in school, Cindy, is in a moment of peril, he offers her a large wad of cash to buy himself popularity.  The two pose as a couple at their school, with her at his side he is able to walk down the Popular Kids' hallway, eat at their lunch tables, and become included in their social activities.  Eventually, according to plan, he and Cindy split and his popular status is secured.  Ron, however, gets a swelled head as he feels he has accomplished something when others haven't, and leaves all his former nerd friends in the dust.  When Cindy, in a moment of anger, reveils that the whole thing was a plot and that he bribed her affection, he gets a sudden cold shoulder from his true friends that he spurned and the cool kids who he thought were true.  Now Ron is really alone.People are followers, no doubt about that.  Ron finds out that the people whose admiration and friendship he sought so hard for are actually shallow, arrogant and insecure.  He himself became shallow and arrogant, and forgot who his real friends were.  The sweetly awkward nerds were more genuine friends than he ever hoped for.  Even the sluttiest girl in the school (who gave more rides than Greyhound) was ashamed she's done the deed with him!  As this was still a fantasy type movie, things work out in the end that Cindy discovers she really does care for him because he's not shallow like her other friends he just wanted to be liked.  Even his nerd friends accept him back, and everyone in school learns a valuable lesson about acceptance.  This is also, as so many of us learn over time, another part of our growing pains.  Many of us can and will achieve a certain status in life where we feel that we are better than others and we let it get away from us until we encounter someone even smaller than we are who takes facts or even some trivial piece of information and rips you to shreds with it.  It hurts, to be sure, but it's part of the maturing process.  And remember, life after high school does not change all that much.  All you can do is cope a bit better.  ANd you know what?  As an adult, you can be way cooler than you were in high school, the rest of them stay there.",5,"Follow Me, all of you ...",1127692800,"09 26, 2005",2005,2664,"['was', 'far', 'greatest', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'part', 'so', 'badly', 'be', 'accepted', 'revelation', 'people', 'are', 'nothing', 'followers', 'know', 'right', 'buttons', 'push.Ronald', 'dork', 'been', 'mooning', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', 'lawn', 'been', 'mowing', 'years', 'also', 'be', 'invited', 'A', 'list', 'parties', 'be', 'liked', 'others', 'fellow', 'nerds', 'just', 'be', 'liked', 'When', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', 'Cindy', 'moment', 'peril', 'large', 'wad', 'cash', 'buy', 'popularity', 'two', 'pose', 'couple', 'school', 'side', 'able', 'walk', 'down', 'Popular', 'Kids', 'hallway', 'eat', 'lunch', 'tables', 'become', 'included', 'social', 'activities', 'Eventually', 'according', 'plan', 'Cindy', 'split', 'popular', 'status', 'secured', 'Ron', 'however', 'swelled', 'head', 'accomplished', 'something', 'when', 'others', 'have', ""n't"", 'former', 'nerd', 'friends', 'dust', 'When', 'Cindy', 'moment', 'anger', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'plot', 'bribed', 'affection', 'sudden', 'cold', 'shoulder', 'true', 'friends', 'spurned', 'cool', 'kids', 'who', 'thought', 'were', 'true', 'Now', 'Ron', 'really', 'alone.People', 'are', 'followers', 'doubt', 'Ron', 'out', 'people', 'admiration', 'friendship', 'sought', 'so', 'hard', 'are', 'actually', 'shallow', 'arrogant', 'insecure', 'became', 'shallow', 'arrogant', 'forgot', 'who', 'real', 'friends', 'were', 'sweetly', 'awkward', 'nerds', 'were', 'more', 'genuine', 'friends', 'ever', 'hoped', 'Even', 'sluttiest', 'girl', 'school', 'who', 'gave', 'more', 'rides', 'Greyhound', 'was', 'ashamed', 'done', 'deed', 'was', 'still', 'fantasy', 'type', 'movie', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'end', 'Cindy', 'really', 'care', 'not', 'shallow', 'other', 'friends', 'just', 'wanted', 'be', 'liked', 'Even', 'nerd', 'friends', 'accept', 'back', 'everyone', 'school', 'valuable', 'lesson', 'acceptance', 'also', 'so', 'many', 'learn', 'time', 'part', 'growing', 'pains', 'Many', 'can', 'will', 'achieve', 'certain', 'status', 'life', 'where', 'feel', 'are', 'better', 'others', 'let', 'get', 'away', 'encounter', 'someone', 'even', 'smaller', 'are', 'who', 'facts', 'even', 'trivial', 'piece', 'information', 'rips', 'shreds', 'be', 'sure', 'part', 'maturing', 'process', 'remember', 'life', 'high', 'school', 'not', 'change', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'cope', 'bit', 'better', 'know', 'what', 'adult', 'can', 'be', 'way', 'cooler', 'were', 'high', 'school', 'rest', 'stay', 'there']",N/A

He's been saving up for many summers (cutting grass) to buy a really awesome telescope.  He goes to the mall to get it and instead runs into Cindy Mancini (Amanda Petersen), the girl of his dreams, who is pretty, popular and the head cheerleader.  Although they go to school together and Ronnie cuts her grass, Cindy doesn't even know his name.  Cindy is in a predicament - - she has worn her mom's off-limits suede outfit to an end of summer party and got wine spilled on it.  A replacement is a thousand dollars - - which Ronnie happens to have handy.  He forsakes his telescope, instead ""paying"" Cindy a thousand dollars to pretend to be his girlfriend for the first month of school. As imagined, the alleged match is met with skepticism and horror by the ""in crowd"" and just plain skepticism by Ronnie's old friends, who he will soon abandon for life in the fast lane of the popular kids.  Cindy makes Ronnie over, to make him look more hip and cool, and she soon begins to see more in Ronnie than originally met her eye.  But their one month contract is up, and Ronnie has come to believe his own popularity.  Will Ronnie fall from grace with the popular kids?  Will he realize that Cindy has fallen for him?  Will they get together?Pretty basic stuff, but ""Love"" is such a fun movie because it will really remind you of high school.  The popular kids look down on the ""nerdy"" kids, picking on them when bored.  The popular girls that never gave Ronnie a look when he was sitting with the nerds are now falling over each other to date him, once he is ""seeing"" Cindy.  Cindy proves to be a pleasant surprise - - she is pretty, blonde and a cheerleader, but she has depth.  She is a secret writer, something she shares only with Ronnie - - and she complains to him that she doesn't ""do"" anything but hang out and shop, and she wants to do more, but people don't expect anything else from her.  Touching stuff.Amanda Petersen is wonderful as Cindy - - you can feel her admiration and affection for Ronnie building, and feel as crushed as she does over Ronnie's transformation into the media monster who believes his own hype.  What ever happened to this appealing actress anyhow?The message the film sends across is perhaps a little schmaltzy towards the end (only filmmakers in Hollywood think that popular kids in school are going to applaud what a perceived nerdy kid says in the cafeteria) but incredibly satisfying.  While feeling that Ronnie deserves the come-uppance that he gets, you also feel sympathy that he was exposed in such a public manner and that he is blacklisted not only by the popular group but also by his former friends.  Patrick Dempsey brings a tenderness and yearning to Ronnie that makes him so appealing, even when he's being full of himself.Does Ronnie get his girl at the end?

Years before ""McDreamy,"" Patrick Dempsey plays Ronald, who like most guys in town, has a thing for Cindy Mancini, the captain of the cheerleaders the prettiest girl in Tucson. The nerdy Ronald is constantly picked on and is tired of being considered a nerd. Wanting his senior year to be more than ""cards with the tards"" as his brother Chucky calls it (played wonderfully by Seth Green when he was just a kid), Ronald finds himself in a position to help Cindy out of a predicament. She needs money to replace a suede outfit she borrowed from her mother and ruined, and he needs to be popular. Cindy doesn't think Ronald's plan will work, but she has little choice. She agrees to pretend to be his girlfriend for one month, but not even Ronald expects his plan to go over with such initial success. But soon, things unravel as they tend to do, and Ronald and Cindy both learn a lot from their mistakes. It's a great 80's movie with a wonderful message about being yourself entwined in it.
