I thought this movie was very good, I have not laughed watching a comedy in a long time, do not be fooled by the first 20 minutes of this film, I thought for sure this was going to be very bad in fact my wife and I agreed we would give it ten more minutes, we wore very happy we did, the acting was fantastic the story has been done before but this is very funny, I believe his name is Matthew Settle I had never seen him before very funny, he and the lead actress, played off each other fantastic I saw it on Netflix it is a free right now in fact it is the only reason I even watched it, give it a try very enjoyable especially if you need a good laugh, you will not be disappointed.",4,Very Surprised,1384387200,"11 14, 2013",2013,779,"['write', 'very', 'few', 'reviews', 'only', 'write', 'movie', 'really', 'bad', 'very', 'good', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'have', 'not', 'laughed', 'watching', 'comedy', 'long', 'time', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'fooled', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'thought', 'sure', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'bad', 'fact', 'wife', 'agreed', 'would', 'give', 'ten', 'more', 'minutes', 'wore', 'very', 'happy', 'did', 'acting', 'was', 'fantastic', 'story', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'very', 'funny', 'believe', 'name', 'Matthew', 'Settle', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'very', 'funny', 'lead', 'actress', 'played', 'off', 'other', 'fantastic', 'saw', 'Netflix', 'free', 'right', 'now', 'fact', 'only', 'reason', 'even', 'watched', 'give', 'try', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'especially', 'need', 'good', 'laugh', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",Love Sick Love
1636427,A29XWXJ525HH7O,B00BNV9WCM,MyD -- The Viewpoint,"[2, 3]","3 1/2 stars.You know your date is going very wrong when you wake up duct taped to a chair wearing grandma's earrings!  This terrific movie starts off with a bit of a lifetime movie feel, but with a little more sex and pith tossed in.  It gets a little wacked from there.Norman is you're stereotypical womanizing jerk who isn't looking for commitment.  One of his conquests, Dori (played by very hot Katia Winter) invites him to a long weekend getaway. She may seem a little needy, but her sexuality is more than persuasive, and he relents.  Things are clearly not going as expected when she tells him she loves him and makes a surprise with Valentine's Day.... in June.  What's more, they are not alone and members of her family are in on the craziness.  Think Misery with granny, gramps, and her kids involved.  Dori previously told Norman that making it through all the holidays of the year together was a sign that a relationship is meant to be.  Beginning with Valentines, she drags Norman through all the holidays of the year crammed into the same week.  Meanwhile, he discovers if he doesn't escape before ""New Years"" there is a very special game in store.  Dark discoveries, bizzar pretend holidays, and a few hilarious moments carry this movie through to the end result.This movie is darkly comedic.  It may not be a complete knee slapper, nor a horror movie.  However, I did find the situations and results pretty humorous throughout.  I recommend it as a rental for a mildly dark, mildly funny comedy.  The acting is well done and production values are good for what I would still call a B movie.",4,YOU KNOW YOUR DATE IS GOING VERY WRONG WHEN.....,1369872000,"05 30, 2013",2013,1606,"['3', '1/2', 'stars.You', 'know', 'date', 'going', 'very', 'wrong', 'when', 'wake', 'up', 'duct', 'taped', 'chair', 'wearing', 'grandma', 'earrings', 'terrific', 'movie', 'bit', 'lifetime', 'movie', 'feel', 'little', 'more', 'sex', 'pith', 'tossed', 'little', 'wacked', 'there.Norman', ""'re"", 'stereotypical', 'womanizing', 'jerk', 'who', ""n't"", 'looking', 'commitment', 'One', 'conquests', 'Dori', 'played', 'very', 'hot', 'Katia', 'Winter', 'long', 'weekend', 'getaway', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'needy', 'sexuality', 'more', 'persuasive', 'Things', 'are', 'clearly', 'not', 'going', 'expected', 'when', 'surprise', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'June', 'What', 'more', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'members', 'family', 'are', 'craziness', 'Think', 'Misery', 'granny', 'gramps', 'kids', 'involved', 'Dori', 'previously', 'told', 'Norman', 'making', 'holidays', 'year', 'together', 'was', 'sign', 'relationship', 'meant', 'be', 'Beginning', 'Valentines', 'Norman', 'holidays', 'year', 'crammed', 'same', 'week', 'Meanwhile', ""n't"", 'escape', 'New', 'Years', 'very', 'special', 'game', 'store', 'Dark', 'discoveries', 'bizzar', 'pretend', 'holidays', 'few', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'carry', 'movie', 'end', 'result.This', 'movie', 'darkly', 'comedic', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'complete', 'knee', 'slapper', 'horror', 'movie', 'However', 'did', 'find', 'situations', 'results', 'pretty', 'humorous', 'recommend', 'rental', 'mildly', 'dark', 'mildly', 'funny', 'comedy', 'acting', 'well', 'done', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'good', 'what', 'would', 'still', 'call', 'B', 'movie']",Love Sick Love

She has apparently met Mr. Right in Norman (Matthew Settle). They have an intimate relationship she reads too much into. Norman agrees to a long weekend getaway to a secluded home up north. Here Norman is surprised by Dori's two children and grandparents. Things turn sour after Dori says the dreaded &#34;L&#34; word and we soon see Norman in the tied up condition depicted on the cover.Dori abides by a relationship book that claims you have to experience all the holidays with each other, which she quickly does in June, with her family considering the odd behavior normal.This is indeed a quirky film, one for women who have grown tired of bad relationships. It is an impressive indie which oozed with dark comedy and ironic statements.

1636429,A31BDEUO4D8X6W,B00BNV9WCM,wade,"[1, 3]","great little film, that is sure to please and have everybody talking about. the storyline is a little hard to make sense of but the acting and locations were very well done. the main actor and actress were very attactive and the attraction for each other was at first instantaneous. but as the story progresses the very sexy actress/lover shows a little more of a very weird family and up-bringing. seems like everyday there is a different holiday that the family celebrates complete with all the make up and costumes. Just wonder if there could be a true relation between a guy and gal when the girl is very sexy but totally off the wall. film was very entertaining and a little hard to watch with how the guy was abused by his girlfriend, one memorable scene has the actress stuff some unmentionables into the guys mouth to keep him from talking... unbelievable. overall this would be a great film for couples, and sure that they would have plenty to say about it.",4,what a weird love story,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,966,"['great', 'little', 'film', 'sure', 'please', 'have', 'everybody', 'talking', 'storyline', 'little', 'hard', 'make', 'sense', 'acting', 'locations', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'main', 'actor', 'actress', 'were', 'very', 'attactive', 'attraction', 'other', 'was', 'first', 'instantaneous', 'story', 'very', 'sexy', 'actress/lover', 'little', 'more', 'very', 'weird', 'family', 'up-bringing', 'everyday', 'different', 'holiday', 'family', 'complete', 'make', 'up', 'costumes', 'Just', 'wonder', 'could', 'be', 'true', 'relation', 'guy', 'gal', 'when', 'girl', 'very', 'sexy', 'totally', 'wall', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'little', 'hard', 'watch', 'how', 'guy', 'was', 'abused', 'girlfriend', 'one', 'memorable', 'scene', 'actress', 'stuff', 'unmentionables', 'guys', 'mouth', 'keep', 'talking', 'unbelievable', 'overall', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'couples', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'plenty', 'say']",Love Sick Love
