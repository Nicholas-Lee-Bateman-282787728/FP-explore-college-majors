I'd seen parts of Oliver Twist on Masterpiece Theatre but missed parts as well. That's what inspired me to purchase the set. Well, this is the most ragged, poorly constructed set of DVD's that I've ever purchased! Mid-way through Twist it just froze. And that was it! The DVD never moved again. I tried several of the others and they skipped at various important places. Just let me say that the experience was TERRIBLE! and now I am leary about replacing them!

This is a piece of garbage in terms of quality.  The DVD's do not play and if they do, be prepared for them to freeze and then having to skip a lot of the story.

1229954,AYHANBLNNN9OF,B001PU8O6G,"Fortune ""Fortune""","[1, 1]","There is no one who could write like Dickens today.  His development of hundreds of characters is phenomenal.  His descriptions are rich and his ability to transport one into a scene or period is so masterful.  This collection of films is very good for the most part.  There have been previous productions that I liked better such as The Little Dorrit production with Derek Jacobi but cannot find it on disc for U.S. play.  Once I got  used to the actor playing the &#34;new&#34; Mr. Clenam, Matthew Macfayden, this proved to be an enjoyable production with some wonderful character portrayals.  I especially was fond of the gypsy, Mr. Pancks. The fearsome Rigaud was masterfully portrayed.  James Fleet who is a very active actor and a favorite of mine was the perfect brother to Amy's father Mr. Dorrit.  Emma Pierson as Fanny Dorrit was  brilliant and a scene stealer and was all around terrific.  Ms. Pierson made this production for me.  She was fun and multi-faceted.  Alun Armstrong as Flintwich certainly made an outstanding performance in portraying this character.  All in all,  there is a great cast in this production.Great Expectations was pretty good but previous productions are much better.  The Old Curiosity Shop could not be saved even with Derek Jacobi present.  It was an awlful production and this story has never been a favorite of mine.  There were so many missed opportunities to make this a good production.The productions I found especially enjoyable were Bleak House and Little Dorrit.Bleak House was a very rich and thought out production.  I even liked Gillian Anderson's portrayal of Lady Dedlock.  All of the actors were top-notch.  Mr. Guppy, portrayed by Burn Gorman was one of my favorites.  Philip Davis' portrayal of the disgusting Smallweed was iconic.  Charles Dance pulled off a brilliant Tulkinghorn.  Alun Armstrong, who has been in many films and TV productions was present in Bleak House and Lilttle Dorrit.  Mr. Armstrong is an actor's actor.  He immerses himself in every role and to say he is genius is not enough praise.  The talented Anna Maxwell Martin was charming as Esther Summerson and, I believe, perfect for the part.  This production also had a wonderful cast.Now, with all the praise mentioned here, there have been problems with the discs themselves.  I was able to find a seller who tested the entire collection and I have found it nearly glich free.  There were only a couple of small trouble spots freezing in the entire collection.  So, if you decide to buy this collection,  find a seller who has tested the discs and found them free of defects.",5,Dickens is the Best,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,2609,"['one', 'who', 'could', 'write', 'Dickens', 'today', 'development', 'hundreds', 'characters', 'phenomenal', 'descriptions', 'are', 'rich', 'ability', 'transport', 'one', 'scene', 'period', 'so', 'masterful', 'collection', 'films', 'very', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'have', 'been', 'previous', 'productions', 'liked', 'better', 'such', 'Little', 'Dorrit', 'production', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'disc', 'U.S.', 'play', 'Once', 'got', 'used', 'actor', 'playing', '34', 'new', '34', 'Mr.', 'Clenam', 'Matthew', 'Macfayden', 'proved', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'production', 'wonderful', 'character', 'portrayals', 'especially', 'was', 'fond', 'gypsy', 'Mr.', 'Pancks', 'fearsome', 'Rigaud', 'was', 'masterfully', 'portrayed', 'James', 'Fleet', 'who', 'very', 'active', 'actor', 'favorite', 'mine', 'was', 'perfect', 'brother', 'Amy', 'father', 'Mr.', 'Dorrit', 'Emma', 'Pierson', 'Fanny', 'Dorrit', 'was', 'brilliant', 'scene', 'stealer', 'was', 'terrific', 'Ms.', 'Pierson', 'made', 'production', 'was', 'fun', 'multi-faceted', 'Alun', 'Armstrong', 'Flintwich', 'certainly', 'made', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'portraying', 'character', 'great', 'cast', 'production.Great', 'Expectations', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'previous', 'productions', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'Old', 'Curiosity', 'Shop', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'saved', 'even', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'present', 'was', 'awlful', 'production', 'story', 'never', 'been', 'favorite', 'mine', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'make', 'good', 'production.The', 'productions', 'found', 'especially', 'enjoyable', 'were', 'Bleak', 'House', 'Little', 'Dorrit.Bleak', 'House', 'was', 'very', 'rich', 'thought', 'out', 'production', 'even', 'liked', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'portrayal', 'Lady', 'Dedlock', 'actors', 'were', 'top-notch', 'Mr.', 'Guppy', 'portrayed', 'Burn', 'Gorman', 'was', 'one', 'favorites', 'Philip', 'Davis', 'portrayal', 'disgusting', 'Smallweed', 'was', 'iconic', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'pulled', 'off', 'brilliant', 'Tulkinghorn', 'Alun', 'Armstrong', 'who', 'been', 'many', 'films', 'TV', 'productions', 'was', 'present', 'Bleak', 'House', 'Lilttle', 'Dorrit', 'Mr.', 'Armstrong', 'actor', 'actor', 'role', 'say', 'genius', 'not', 'enough', 'praise', 'talented', 'Anna', 'Maxwell', 'Martin', 'was', 'charming', 'Esther', 'Summerson', 'believe', 'perfect', 'part', 'production', 'also', 'had', 'wonderful', 'cast.Now', 'praise', 'mentioned', 'here', 'have', 'been', 'problems', 'discs', 'was', 'able', 'find', 'seller', 'who', 'tested', 'entire', 'collection', 'have', 'found', 'nearly', 'glich', 'free', 'were', 'only', 'couple', 'small', 'trouble', 'spots', 'freezing', 'entire', 'collection', 'So', 'decide', 'buy', 'collection', 'find', 'seller', 'who', 'tested', 'discs', 'found', 'free', 'defects']",The Charles Dickens Masterworks Collection
