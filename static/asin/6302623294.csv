323536,A2VMT89TCSF105,6302623294,"Ashtar Command ""Seeker""","[2, 3]","""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is a cult classic from the 1970's. It comes close to being a turkey movie, but somehow manages to stay clear from this questionable honour (just about).Part documentary, part low-budget horror flick, ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" confirms our most deep-seated prejudices about fly-over country. Set in the Deep South, in a small community where rodent-hunting, cow-ranching and bean-cultivation are the major pastimes (whenever the locals are brave enough to leave their trailers), the film tells the story of the Fouke Monster, a hairy giant roaming the swamps and scaring the living daylights out of pretty much everyone from teenage girls to stray cowboys. Country music plays in the background, while the narrator expresses his sympathies for the presumably lonely monster who simply wants some human company. Best lines: ""Mary Beth, there's a draft on the baby"" and ""HE ALWAYS TRAVELS THE CREEKS"".All actors are amateurs from Fouke or Texarkana in Arkansas, and the film is based on real events, in the sense that a Bigfoot-like creature really was spotted in the area a few years earlier. Sightings have continued to this day, and the TV show ""MonsterQuest"" recently sent an expedition to track down the monster (unsuccessfully).It seems the big guy got away. Hardly surprising, since he got three toes and is immune to hillbilly bullets!I'm not sure how to rate this pop culture icon, but since I don't want to be followed by an armed posse of hooded cryptozoologists in the dead of night, I suppose I have to give it...five stars. :P",5,He always travels the creeks,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,1567,"['Legend', 'Boggy', 'Creek', 'cult', 'classic', '1970', 'close', 'being', 'turkey', 'movie', 'somehow', 'stay', 'clear', 'questionable', 'honour', 'just', 'about', '.Part', 'documentary', 'part', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'flick', 'Legend', 'Boggy', 'Creek', 'most', 'deep-seated', 'prejudices', 'fly-over', 'country', 'Set', 'Deep', 'South', 'small', 'community', 'where', 'rodent-hunting', 'cow-ranching', 'bean-cultivation', 'are', 'major', 'pastimes', 'locals', 'are', 'brave', 'enough', 'leave', 'trailers', 'film', 'story', 'Fouke', 'Monster', 'hairy', 'giant', 'roaming', 'swamps', 'scaring', 'living', 'daylights', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'teenage', 'girls', 'stray', 'cowboys', 'Country', 'music', 'plays', 'background', 'narrator', 'sympathies', 'presumably', 'lonely', 'monster', 'who', 'simply', 'human', 'company', 'Best', 'lines', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'draft', 'baby', 'HE', 'ALWAYS', 'THE', 'CREEKS', '.All', 'actors', 'are', 'amateurs', 'Fouke', 'Texarkana', 'Arkansas', 'film', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'sense', 'Bigfoot-like', 'creature', 'really', 'was', 'spotted', 'area', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'Sightings', 'have', 'continued', 'day', 'TV', 'show', 'MonsterQuest', 'recently', 'sent', 'expedition', 'track', 'down', 'monster', 'unsuccessfully', '.It', 'big', 'guy', 'got', 'away', 'Hardly', 'surprising', 'got', 'three', 'toes', 'immune', 'hillbilly', 'bullets', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'rate', 'pop', 'culture', 'icon', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'followed', 'armed', 'posse', 'hooded', 'cryptozoologists', 'dead', 'night', 'suppose', 'have', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'P']",Legend of Boggy Creek VHS

323541,A3G0TESLQF4HFK,6302623294,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[0, 0]","In 1972 Charles B. Pierce did his best to scare a good part of the movie going population with a small independent film about a big foot type monster that was appearing in a little town called Fouke, Arkansas. The film, made on a shoestring budget of $160,000 grossed more than 20,000,000 making it one of the biggest films of that year.Shot as a documentary with reenactments the film has a sort of nostalgic charm that has influenced many later independent film makers.Fouke, Arkansas is a sleepy Southern town that borders Louisiana and Texas. The people there spend most of their time working the land and hunting and fishing. The unique thing about the town is that since approximately 1946 a strange creature has been prowling the bottom lands near Boggy Creek. This creature  described as a seven foot tall bipedal is covered with fur and has three toes. At first gentle the creature has gotten more and more aggressive since its contacts with the local population. The film culminates in an attack on the Ford family in 1971 that sent one person to the hospital.Told in a folksy narration the story contains interviews with many of the townspeople  often playing themselves.The question that comes to mind throughout the film is whether what we are seeing is real or some sort of elaborate hoax. I remember seeing this when it came out and seeing it some forty-two years later found it still to be enjoyable if a little dated.The DVD is a standard  defination full frame presentation. The source material is not very good. The picture is very soft throughout t but serviceable. The mono sound is pretty clear and poses no problems of understanding. One wishes that there had been a decent restoration of the film but the interest level was probably quite low. The DVD by Cheezy Films presents some trailers, an intermission reel and a silent episode of a creature from the Black Lagoon type serial.Many independent film makers credit this little film as an inspiration so it is worth checking out.

323544,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6302623294,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[25, 35]","Prior to the actual start of the film The Legend of Boggy Creek (1973) some text appears on the screen stating, `This is a true story.  Some of the people in this motion picture portray themselves...in many cases on actual locations', which I read into as meaning `this is an extremely low budget production and we can't afford real actors, so we're going to use some locals with the hope that the thrill of being in a real, honest to goodness movie will be sufficient compensation'.  The movie was produced and directed by Charles B. Pierce (his first), who would later go on to make such films like Bootleggers (1974), The Town That Dreaded Sundown (1976), and The Evictors (1979), titles most of y'all probably never heard of...well, neither have I, but there out there and someone's paying to see them as Mr. Pierce has produced and/or directed something like 12 features in the span of 25 years...The film begins with slow pan shots in a boggy, swamp-like area with an extended (more like distended) sequence of nature shots, featuring what appears to be every stinkin' beaver, lizard, newt, frog, turtle, bird and mossy tree stump the filmmaker could find.  The dubbed audio played over this sequence features a lot of strange noise sounding like those of two, large gorillas fighting each other for dominance over a female in heat, or Rosie O'Donnell at feeding time (I've never heard the latter, but I gotta figure both sound fairly similar).  After about six hours of this (I'm exaggerating a little), we finally roll into the main credits, and then into the movie proper.  Through a series of re-enactments (some with actual dialog, some dubbed over by narration or what appears to be prerecorded interviews) and establishing shots, we learn of a creature, dubbed the `Fouke Monster', which has been stirring up some trouble in and around the area of Fouke, Arkansas for a number of years.  Here are some facts the film imparts;1. It's hairy...very hairy.2. Has three-toes (you know, everywhere else in the world where there's been bigfoot/Sasquatch sightings the creature generally has five toes on each foot...leave to Arkansonians to find one with three toes per foot).3. Walks upright like a man.4. Dwells along the densely thicketed, bottomlands of the region, sticking relatively close to the numerous, aquatic tributaries that populate the area, as it likes to wash its feet.5. Like to eat prize livestock, with a particular fondness for large hogs.6. Frightens all animals, sometimes to death (especially cats).7. Has been shot at a number of times and hit at least once.8. Likes to prowl about after dusk, inadvertently scaring folks witless (or scaring witless folk...).9. Is drawn to trailer homes, tarpaper shacks, and lean-to shanties.So what is it?  Bigfoot?  Sasquatch?  A rogue hippy?  An alien being in need of a shearing?  Or perhaps it's all a hoax, perpetrated by the town residents with an eye towards developing a lucrative tourist trade, selling monster related memorabilia like snow globes, three toed castings, and t-shirts proclaiming `My parents went and saw the Fouke Monster and all I got was this lousy t-shirt'...perhaps we'll never know, as some things in life are meant to remain mysteries (like why does the clothes dryer continually steal my socks?  Or why people think Carrot Top is funny?).A true story?  More like carefully constructed dramatizations exacerbating already overblown events.  Now, I'm not saying none of this stuff is true, but I do wonder how much of what was related may have been the result of homemade spirits...I mean really, you can't expect me to believe any number of these distinctly ruralistic individuals hadn't partook in some stump liquor...one thing I really liked about this film was the voice of the narrator, belonging to a man named Vern Stierman, who was, at one point, the weatherman for the Texarkana-Shreveport NBC affiliate channel 6.  His voice was very smooth, almost calming, which provided a very professional tone and a good balance for a film filled with unprofessional, haphazard shots and awkward edits.  Given the variance in the methods of presenting the material, I wasn't entirely sure if I was watching a documentary, a horror film, or a hillbilly travelogue.  I say documentary, but I suppose I should preface that with the term `quasi' because it resembled such, as I got the sense much was embellished during the re-enactments...we all know events, especially those experienced under duress, have a tendency to grow over time.  And this wasn't helped much by the presentation of the creature, looking very much like a man in a gorilla suit with a Beatle wig.  I won't comment much on the acting, as it appeared director Pierce used a lot of non actors i.e. local residents in the re-enactments, most likely due to lack of funds, but I'm sure he'd say it was done in an effort to maintain a sense of veracity.  The movie does tend to run a bit long, as good deal of the material is dragged out with lingering shots, certainly not helped by a couple of pointless musical interludes smack dab in the middle of the film.  One of my favorite parts included a visit with the elderly hermit who sported a limp, caused by, as we're told, him shooting part of his foot off in a boating accident (?!)...there's a tale I'd be interesting in hearing.  Now you'd think since the man had been an isolated resident of the bottomlands for some 20 years, he'd surely back up the claims of the existence of such a creature, but he actually refutes it, saying it's a bunch of malarkey.  Another part I found entertaining was during the last re-enactment as we see a group of people occupying a lonely house, and the creature is depicted prowling about over the course of a couple of nights.  There are a few of scenes within this section showing the creature going after the same man, the last being while the man was occupying the commode (the creature tried to grab him through the window).  The narrator states it was a mystery as to why the creature was so interested in that, particular house, but I'd venture to guess it just really liked that man, as perhaps his individual scent was a mating lure.  All in all not a bad independently released feature, if your expectations aren't all that high.I've noticed there are a few different DVD releases of this film, but the one I have was produced by a company called Hen's Tooth Video, and the cover artwork has a figure imposed on a orangish tinted backdrop of a sunset.  The full screen picture (1.33:1) looks reasonably decent, for an independent film released some thirty plus years ago.  Some areas of the print are a bit rougher than others, but it is watchable.  The audio comes through fairly clean and clear so I had no complaint there.Cookieman108",3,"""What kind of thang can pick up two 100 lb hogs and walk away with them?""",1121385600,"07 15,

Then I went on Amazon and decided all those 4- and 5-star reviews must have influenced me.  I also noticed the negative reviews are generally marked ""unhelpful,"" so I suspect this film has a strong cult following (like ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"") and my review will be rated ""unhelpful"" too.  This is supposed to be a documentary about sightings of a ""Big Foot""-type ""monster"" in a rural area of Arkansas.  Yet there are no scientists or other authorities interviewed. Assertions are made without support, like the claim this creature is the ""only one of his kind"" and may reappear out of loneliness and frustration. There is no critical analysis of the data.  Most of the film involves recreations of reported events, with laughable dialogue and acting.  It is not clear whether anybody in the film was an actual eye-witness. Certainly no one is asked any tough questions in an interview to try and determine whether this is a hoax.  There is absolutely nothing scarey about this movie either.

323550,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6302623294,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","THE LEGEND OF BOGGY CREEK (documentary, 1972) is about the town of Fouke, Arkansas, and the Sasquatches residing around the area. The Arkansas Bigfoot, which was known as ""the Fouke Monster"" in that area, seems to love this area--and who can blame them?Fouke is surrounded by swampland. It seems like a fine habitat for an animal I know is real--and we ALL know this, thanks to Roger Patterson's 1967 footage of a female Sasquatch in Oregon. But I think people, especially today, fail to comprehend the fact that BOGGY CREEK is a film that kicked off a genre.It is a documentary--I don't know where people get the idea it is a horror movie, a mockumentary (even Bigfooters call it that sometimes). In fact, the film is modeled after the very early work of Jacques Cousteau. This is because of the simple fact that Cousteau did not have a regular strong documentary presence yet in 1972.So you could say Cousteau in turn may have been influenced by this film.People whine about the reenactments in BOGGY CREEK--because that is precisely what they are--yet the people in the reenactments are the actual witnesses playing themselves. Heck, even Cousteau regularly reenacted or even faked parts of his films, but he never lied nor was he trying to deceive.This also established that very bad acting and overall cheap, crude nature of reenactments in documentaries. I have always detested that, but I respect BOGGY CREEK for establishing it and launching innumerable TV shows. People always seem to miss all those facts, and the chief fact that BOGGY CREEK is the first of its kind. Naturally we take this kind of stuff too much for granted today.I don't know that this film is all that frightening; no more frightening than any other cryptid-oriented documentary I have ever seen. And I have seen them all. Is it ""cheesy""? Of course, it was filmed around 1972 or possibly going back to 1971, so what do you expect? Yet the last thing I think people fail to appreciate is the movie addressed a few pieces of strong evidence about the Sasquatch that would not become common knowledge for several decades.One example is the line in the film in the narration, when the fellow says, ""It always follows the creeks."" Sasquatchers everywhere know this as do all biologists and zoologists: animals stick to a good water and food source. The creek, which I assume means Boggy Creek in Fouke, is precisely that.I feel people should understand all the things I have referenced before they get this, and I feel you MUST GET THIS. It is the granddaddy of everything we find so familiar on TV today, and as far as I know it is the only serious theatrical release of a Bigfoot documentary.The other impressive documentaries I have seen are all TV shows, produced for TV or else done as excellent series likeFinding Bigfoot Sneak Peek(see my reviews--sadly at this point the seasons of FINDING BIGFOOT are available only as individual episodes and that is a custom I am not appreciating at all).",5,This documentary established a semi-confusing yet important genre,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,2974,"['LEGEND', 'OF', 'BOGGY', 'CREEK', 'documentary', '1972', 'town', 'Fouke', 'Arkansas', 'Sasquatches', 'residing', 'area', 'Arkansas', 'Bigfoot', 'was', 'known', 'Fouke', 'Monster', 'area', 'love', 'area', 'who', 'can', 'blame', 'Fouke', 'surrounded', 'swampland', 'fine', 'habitat', 'animal', 'know', 'real', 'ALL', 'know', 'thanks', 'Roger', 'Patterson', '1967', 'footage', 'female', 'Sasquatch', 'Oregon', 'think', 'people', 'especially', 'today', 'fail', 'comprehend', 'fact', 'BOGGY', 'CREEK', 'film', 'kicked', 'off', 'genre.It', 'documentary', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'people', 'get', 'idea', 'horror', 'movie', 'mockumentary', 'even', 'Bigfooters', 'call', 'sometimes', 'fact', 'film', 'modeled', 'very', 'early', 'work', 'Jacques', 'Cousteau', 'simple', 'fact', 'Cousteau', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'regular', 'strong', 'documentary', 'presence', 'yet', '1972.So', 'could', 'say', 'Cousteau', 'turn', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'influenced', 'film.People', 'whine', 'reenactments', 'BOGGY', 'CREEK', 'precisely', 'what', 'are', 'yet', 'people', 'reenactments', 'are', 'actual', 'witnesses', 'playing', 'Heck', 'even', 'Cousteau', 'regularly', 'reenacted', 'even', 'faked', 'parts', 'films', 'never', 'lied', 'was', 'trying', 'deceive.This', 'also', 'established', 'very', 'bad', 'acting', 'overall', 'cheap', 'crude', 'nature', 'reenactments', 'documentaries', 'have', 'always', 'detested', 'respect', 'BOGGY', 'CREEK', 'establishing', 'launching', 'innumerable', 'TV', 'shows', 'People', 'always', 'seem', 'miss', 'facts', 'chief', 'fact', 'BOGGY', 'CREEK', 'first', 'kind', 'Naturally', 'take', 'kind', 'stuff', 'too', 'much', 'granted', 'today.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'film', 'frightening', 'more', 'frightening', 'other', 'cryptid-oriented', 'documentary', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'have', 'seen', 'cheesy', 'course', 'was', 'filmed', '1972', 'possibly', 'going', 'back', '1971', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'last', 'thing', 'think', 'people', 'fail', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'addressed', 'few', 'pieces', 'strong', 'evidence', 'Sasquatch', 'would', 'not', 'become', 'common', 'knowledge', 'several', 'decades.One', 'example', 'line', 'film', 'narration', 'when', 'fellow', 'always', 'creeks', 'Sasquatchers', 'everywhere', 'know', 'do', 'biologists', 'zoologists', 'animals', 'stick', 'good', 'water', 'food', 'source', 'creek', 'assume', 'means', 'Boggy', 'Creek', 'Fouke', 'precisely', 'that.I', 'feel', 'people', 'should', 'understand', 'things', 'have', 'referenced', 'get', 'feel', 'MUST', 'GET', 'THIS', 'granddaddy', 'everything', 'find', 'so', 'familiar', 'TV', 'today', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'only', 'serious', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Bigfoot', 'documentary.The', 'other', 'impressive', 'documentaries', 'have', 'seen', 'are', 'TV', 'shows', 'produced', 'TV', 'else', 'done', 'excellent', 'series', 'likeFinding', 'Bigfoot', 'Sneak', 'Peek', 'see', 'reviews', 'sadly', 'point', 'seasons', 'FINDING', 'BIGFOOT', 'are', 'available', 'only', 'individual', 'episodes', 'custom', 'am', 'not', 'appreciating']",Legend of Boggy Creek VHS

Taylor ""GFT""","[29, 38]","Although folklore suggests sightings as early as the 1850s, something has troubled the tiny town of Fouke, Arkansas since the 1940s right up to present day--and residents claim it is a tall, hairy creature with hands like a man and glowing red eyes.  And after a series of somewhat spectacular sightings in the early 1970s, director Charles B. Pierce decided to make a movie about it.I saw LEGEND OF BOGGY CREEK in original theatrical release when I was twelve or so, and it scared the blazes out of me.  When I found this inexpensive DVD version, I grabbed it for the sake of nostalgia--and discovered that what scared me at twelve can barely elicit a raised eyebrow nowadays.  It may still frighten the kiddies, but from an adult point of view, LEGEND OF BOGGY CREEK is pretty tame and lame.Although the film has a few effective moments, they seem to have happened by accident instead of design. The cinematography is a weak effort at a documentary style, and the costume for the Fouke monster is hardly more than a long-haired suit, but now and then they do combine to give you pause--especially in shots when the creature is largely motionless and obscured by trees.  But on the whole, the movie consists of a mix of interviews, scripted actors, and the occasional pause for some hilariously bad &quot;ballad of boggy creek&quot;-type country music.The transfer quality is flatly awful.  Made on the cheap, the look of the film was probably never great to begin with, but after some thirty years in the vault it now in a truly sorry state.  Colors are bleached, the picture is riddled with blips and scratches, and the soundtrack is occasionally crackly.  My final take on the whole thing: if this has some nostalgic appeal, by all means buy it, but don't expect too much.  And if you've don't have those childhood memories to fall back on, pass it by, because that's really all this DVD has going for it.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",2,The Fouke Monster in Pseudo-Documentary,1071273600,"12 13, 2003",2003,1929,"['folklore', 'sightings', 'as', 'early', '1850s', 'something', 'troubled', 'tiny', 'town', 'Fouke', 'Arkansas', '1940s', 'right', 'up', 'present', 'day', 'residents', 'claim', 'tall', 'hairy', 'creature', 'hands', 'man', 'glowing', 'red', 'eyes', 'series', 'somewhat', 'spectacular', 'sightings', 'early', '1970s', 'director', 'Charles', 'B', 'Pierce', 'decided', 'make', 'movie', 'it.I', 'saw', 'LEGEND', 'OF', 'BOGGY', 'CREEK', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'when', 'was', 'twelve', 'so', 'scared', 'blazes', 'When', 'found', 'inexpensive', 'DVD', 'version', 'grabbed', 'sake', 'nostalgia', 'discovered', 'what', 'scared', 'twelve', 'can', 'barely', 'elicit', 'raised', 'eyebrow', 'nowadays', 'may', 'still', 'frighten', 'kiddies', 'adult', 'point', 'view', 'LEGEND', 'OF', 'BOGGY', 'CREEK', 'pretty', 'tame', 'film', 'few', 'effective', 'moments', 'seem', 'have', 'happened', 'accident', 'instead', 'design', 'cinematography', 'weak', 'effort', 'documentary', 'style', 'costume', 'Fouke', 'monster', 'hardly', 'more', 'long-haired', 'suit', 'now', 'then', 'do', 'combine', 'give', 'pause', 'especially', 'shots', 'when', 'creature', 'largely', 'motionless', 'obscured', 'trees', 'whole', 'movie', 'mix', 'interviews', 'scripted', 'actors', 'occasional', 'pause', 'hilariously', 'bad', 'quot', 'ballad', 'boggy', 'creek', 'quot', '-type', 'country', 'music.The', 'transfer', 'quality', 'flatly', 'awful', 'Made', 'cheap', 'look', 'film', 'was', 'probably', 'never', 'great', 'begin', 'thirty', 'years', 'vault', 'now', 'truly', 'sorry', 'state', 'Colors', 'are', 'bleached', 'picture', 'riddled', 'blips', 'scratches', 'soundtrack', 'occasionally', 'crackly', 'final', 'take', 'whole', 'thing', 'nostalgic', 'appeal', 'means', 'buy', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', ""'ve"", 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'childhood', 'memories', 'fall', 'back', 'pass', 'really', 'DVD', 'going', 'it.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",Legend of Boggy Creek VHS

Now he is back in town and telling the story of the elusive creature.Fouke, Missouri is located in the Southwest corner of the state.  It has been the home of monster sightings for decades.  The monster has been dubbed the Fouke Monster.This move is part dramatization and part documentary.  Many of the townspeople are played by themselves although Vern is not.  The movie chronicles Vern's early encounter (aural only) with the creature and the way locals slowly began to believe that there really was something keeping to the water.At one point there is some supposition as to what the creature is.  It walks upright like a man.  It is not a Sasquatch as it only has three toes instead of five.  It is not a gorilla as it is orange.  It might be an orangutan but doesn't act like one or have the right toes.  No final theory is reached other than that enough people have seen it that it must be real.The film looks like a low budget production and many of the night shots are quite dark.

The story is based off of true happenings which gives you a spooky feeling as you watch it. Of course this movie doesn't have the greatest effects or actors but it is a great movie to sit around and watch with a nice bowl of popcorn with friends and family. I am fascinated by the Bigfoot phenomenoun and although I have never had an encounter I personally am a believer. I highly doubt so many people could see somthing that doesn't exist, unlike UFO'S AND LOCH NESS it is a very logical probability when you think about it. Anyway back to the review, this movie takes place in Fouke, Arkansas, and did I mention this movie has a great opening. It features the legendary Fouke monster and features many people who have seen the creature in an actual movie. Many raidings by the creature take place as well as a sighting by three women and a baby completly isolated twenty or so miles in the woods having a sighting(hows that for spooky), anyway they explain many different sightings and many interesting chases after the creature, who truly just wants to be left alone(they even have a sad song for the monster) in conclusion this is a good movie that I think is worth seeing, it goes out with a very good ending as well, but I won't spoil it for you, but the narrator(who saw the creature as a child)has some very good ending lines, and although the creature isn't really seen face to face it just adds to that creepy filling.

It's about a supposedly real beast that wanders the bogs around Fouke, Arkansas, made in the faux-documentary style that was popular for movies about cryptozoological wonders back in the late 60s and early 70s. I remember so well seeing this one for the first time when I was about 12 and being thoroughly creeped out by it. The atmosphere is distinctly eerie -- when it's not inspiring some pretty serious chuckles. It's the only movie that comes to mind that has a theme song for a character who does essentially nothing over the course of the movie except fish (""Hey, Travis Crabtree...Wait a minute for me...""). And the beast's melancholy theme (""Perhaps he dimly wonders why...there is no other such as I...To touch, to love before I die...to listen to my lonely cry ..."") is such sweet schmaltz you can't help but about be moved to tears...for whatever reason.I gotta hand it to director Charles B. Pierce, who managed to make some of nature's most beautiful scenery appear outright sinister. The beast itself is never seen very clearly, mostly in silhouette, and is thus all the more effective. Much of the atmosphere comes from the sound effects -- often the barely heard grunting of the creature along with the chirping of insects and the sounds of birds. And the monster's roar is truly hair-raising. Its nocturnal attacks -- particularly the climactic one, where it tries determinedly to get into a house full of panicked young people bearing shotguns -- are beautifully staged, so authentic you feel like you're right there.As much as anything in this movie, I've always loved the ending, where the narrator returns to his childhood home and says ""I almost wish I could hear that lonely cry one more time, just to be reassured that some mystery still remains in the wilderness.""

Watching it again was not only nostalgic but very entertaining.  I can see why some people wouldn't like it.  If you take it to seriously you will be disappointed.

323592,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,6302623294,Monty Moonlight,"[14, 15]","Fouke, Arkansas is a microscopic town located near Texarkana, by the Texas/Arkansas border. It's the kind of town you can drive through without even knowing you were there. People do it everyday. If they only knew what a mysterious place they were passing through, they might actually stop and look around for a while. Ya see, Fouke is said to be the home of ""The Legend of Boggy Creek.""The legend is known as the Fouke Monster, a huge, hairy, three-toed, red-eyed, bigfoot-like creature, and it's said that he's been sighted in those parts for over a hundred years. It was his rash of bold appearances in the 70s, however, that inspired director Charles B. Pierce (the man behind ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"" and ""Boggy Creek 2: The Legend Continues"") to make this B-movie that is, in fact, a legend in itself. The film is a docu-drama of sorts; a collection of reenactments of some of the more recent and horrific sightings of the creature as experienced by residents of the area. Like the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" or similar films like ""Just Before Dawn"" and ""Encounter With the Unknown,"" ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is saturated with a highly effective, eerie atmosphere that is enhanced by the low budget, the creepy setting, the amateur acting from average looking people, and the otherworldly decade in which it was shot. The surreal music, which includes two original folk songs that greatly add to this bizarre viewing experience (one sung by the director, himself), combines with the swampy locale to transport the viewer to a dreamlike reality that can quickly turn into a nightmare at a moment's notice. The film may seem tame by today's standards, heck, during the day it's almost relaxing, but the knowledge that the stories are supposedly true can still provide the viewer with some decent creeps when seen in the proper atmosphere and setting. Despite the bookend tale of the film's narrator character, the whole thing comes off as very sincere and convincing.For cryptozoology fans and 70's B-horror lovers alike, ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is a must for the home library. The DVD presents the film in fullscreen format, and the picture and sound quality are less than perfect, but completely watchable. The photo gallery and production notes are nothing more than stills from the film, and the only other extra is a Filmography for director Charles B. Pierce. Still, ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is an affordable American classic that every true film buff should own! Don't expect fantastic camera work, gripping character dialogue, or mind-blowing effects, but if you're interested in hearing some spooky tales of what might be lurking out in the woods and swamps by day, and occasionally coming by your house to pay you a visit at night, this one's for you!",5,He Always Travels the Creek...,1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,2791,"['Fouke', 'Arkansas', 'microscopic', 'town', 'located', 'Texarkana', 'Texas/Arkansas', 'border', 'kind', 'town', 'can', 'drive', 'even', 'knowing', 'were', 'there', 'People', 'do', 'everyday', 'only', 'knew', 'what', 'mysterious', 'place', 'were', 'passing', 'might', 'actually', 'stop', 'look', 'around', 'while', 'Ya', 'see', 'Fouke', 'said', 'be', 'home', 'Legend', 'Boggy', 'Creek', 'legend', 'known', 'Fouke', 'Monster', 'huge', 'hairy', 'three-toed', 'red-eyed', 'bigfoot-like', 'creature', 'said', 'been', 'sighted', 'parts', 'hundred', 'years', 'was', 'rash', 'bold', 'appearances', '70s', 'however', 'inspired', 'director', 'Charles', 'B', 'Pierce', 'man', 'Town', 'That', 'Dreaded', 'Sundown', 'Boggy', 'Creek', '2', 'Legend', 'Continues', 'make', 'B-movie', 'fact', 'legend', 'film', 'docu-drama', 'sorts', 'collection', 'reenactments', 'more', 'recent', 'horrific', 'sightings', 'creature', 'experienced', 'residents', 'area', 'original', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'similar', 'films', 'Just', 'Dawn', 'Encounter', 'Unknown', 'Legend', 'Boggy', 'Creek', 'saturated', 'highly', 'effective', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'enhanced', 'low', 'budget', 'creepy', 'setting', 'amateur', 'acting', 'average', 'looking', 'people', 'otherworldly', 'decade', 'was', 'shot', 'surreal', 'music', 'two', 'original', 'folk', 'songs', 'greatly', 'add', 'bizarre', 'viewing', 'experience', 'one', 'sung', 'director', 'combines', 'swampy', 'locale', 'transport', 'viewer', 'dreamlike', 'reality', 'can', 'quickly', 'turn', 'nightmare', 'moment', 'notice', 'film', 'may', 'seem', 'tame', 'today', 'standards', 'heck', 'day', 'almost', 'relaxing', 'knowledge', 'stories', 'are', 'supposedly', 'true', 'can', 'still', 'provide', 'viewer', 'decent', 'creeps', 'when', 'seen', 'proper', 'atmosphere', 'setting', 'bookend', 'tale', 'film', 'narrator', 'character', 'whole', 'thing', 'off', 'very', 'sincere', 'convincing.For', 'cryptozoology', 'fans', '70', 'B-horror', 'lovers', 'alike', 'Legend', 'Boggy', 'Creek', 'must', 'home', 'library', 'DVD', 'film', 'fullscreen', 'format', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'less', 'perfect', 'completely', 'watchable', 'photo', 'gallery', 'production', 'notes', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'stills', 'film', 'only', 'other', 'extra', 'Filmography', 'director', 'Charles', 'B', 'Pierce', 'Still', 'Legend', 'Boggy', 'Creek', 'affordable', 'American', 'classic', 'true', 'film', 'buff', 'should', 'own', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'fantastic', 'camera', 'work', 'gripping', 'character', 'dialogue', 'mind-blowing', 'effects', ""'re"", 'interested', 'hearing', 'spooky', 'tales', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'lurking', 'out', 'woods', 'swamps', 'day', 'occasionally', 'coming', 'house', 'pay', 'visit', 'night', 'one']",Legend of Boggy Creek VHS

Only to name a few. (I know some of you might not consider these &quot;classics&quot;)The first arrival was the DVD of &quot;The Legend of Boggy Creek&quot;.I grew up in a country house on the edge of some creepy woods in Kentucky. We had our own legend of the monster in the woods. Our monster would follow you in the woods as you walked down secluded roads that were surrounded on each side by forest. I recently revisited my childhood neighborhood and drove on that road where our beloved Bigfoot, or &quot;White Thing&quot; as he was named, dwelled in the woods.All the locals still swear that he existed. Although sightings died awhile back. My distant relatives all had a story to share of their encounters. I remember a terrible thunder storm, and my father ran outside to see who was walking around our house looking in the windows. Defying his command to stay in the corner with my sister, I decided to get up and look out the window. I saw my father struggling with a figure, a man I could not make out, in the flashes of lightning. I know it was one of the most frightening things I can remember from my childhood. My father is long gone so I cannot really know what happened that night. But he would never speak of it. Could have been an intruder, and could have been our town legend too. My mother claims to have been grabbed by the creature once in the woods near the rail road tracks that ran through the woods.Watching &quot;Boggy Creek&quot; took me back to those times as a child on that farm in the woods.The film is a documentary based on fact, or supposed fact. It is set in the Arkansas swamps. The events are recreated by the town folk. Something is lurking in the woods in the little town of Fouke and scaring the locals, killing their animals, peeking thru their windows at night, pawing thru the windows at them, and howling in the woods. They believe it a bigfoot type creature. I am so glad I bought this movie. The only complaint I had was the cheap costume they used for the creature and the tedious folk song in the film. I can't help but to wonder if &quot;The Blair Witch&quot; was inspired from this film.A definite great film, although cheesy in its own charming way. But creepy and moody.It reminds me of my town as a child, and the creature that lurked in the woods.",4,Folk Lore at its best,1058918400,"07 23, 2003",2003,2602,"['have', 'recently', 'started', 'revisit', 'films', 'had', 'seen', 'kid', 'yet', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'too', 'well.Forgotten', 'classics', 'am', 'anticipating', 'mail', 'include', 'Humungous', 'My', 'Bloody', 'Valentine', 'Prom', 'Night', 'Zombie', 'Gates', 'Hell', 'eagerly', 'waiting', 're-release', 'Halloween', '3', 'saw', 'once', 'child', 'Only', 'name', 'few', 'know', 'might', 'not', 'consider', 'quot', 'classics', 'quot', 'first', 'arrival', 'was', 'DVD', 'quot', 'Legend', 'Boggy', 'Creek', 'quot', 'grew', 'up', 'country', 'house', 'edge', 'creepy', 'woods', 'Kentucky', 'had', 'own', 'legend', 'monster', 'woods', 'monster', 'would', 'follow', 'woods', 'walked', 'down', 'secluded', 'roads', 'were', 'surrounded', 'side', 'forest', 'recently', 'revisited', 'childhood', 'neighborhood', 'drove', 'road', 'where', 'beloved', 'Bigfoot', 'quot', 'White', 'Thing', 'quot', 'was', 'named', 'dwelled', 'woods.All', 'locals', 'still', 'swear', 'existed', 'sightings', 'died', 'awhile', 'back', 'My', 'distant', 'had', 'story', 'share', 'encounters', 'remember', 'terrible', 'thunder', 'storm', 'father', 'ran', 'outside', 'see', 'who', 'was', 'walking', 'around', 'house', 'looking', 'windows', 'Defying', 'command', 'stay', 'corner', 'sister', 'decided', 'get', 'up', 'look', 'out', 'window', 'saw', 'father', 'struggling', 'figure', 'man', 'could', 'not', 'make', 'out', 'flashes', 'lightning', 'know', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'frightening', 'things', 'can', 'remember', 'childhood', 'father', 'long', 'gone', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'night', 'would', 'never', 'speak', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'intruder', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'town', 'legend', 'too', 'mother', 'claims', 'have', 'been', 'grabbed', 'creature', 'once', 'woods', 'rail', 'road', 'tracks', 'ran', 'woods.Watching', 'quot', 'Boggy', 'Creek', 'quot', 'took', 'back', 'times', 'child', 'farm', 'woods.The', 'film', 'documentary', 'based', 'fact', 'supposed', 'fact', 'set', 'Arkansas', 'swamps', 'events', 'are', 'recreated', 'town', 'folk', 'Something', 'lurking', 'woods', 'little', 'town', 'Fouke', 'scaring', 'locals', 'killing', 'animals', 'peeking', 'thru', 'windows', 'night', 'pawing', 'windows', 'howling', 'woods', 'believe', 'bigfoot', 'type', 'creature', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'bought', 'movie', 'only', 'complaint', 'had', 'was', 'cheap', 'costume', 'used', 'creature', 'tedious', 'folk', 'song', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'quot', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'quot', 'was', 'inspired', 'film.A', 'definite', 'great', 'film', 'cheesy', 'own', 'charming', 'way', 'creepy', 'moody.It', 'reminds', 'town', 'child', 'creature', 'lurked', 'woods']",Legend of Boggy Creek VHS
323594,A3ANS8M1FZ34A9,6302623294,M.S. Striegel,"[1, 1]","This movie is supposedly, along with Cannibal Holocaust, what inspired The Blair Witch Project. Being a fan of that film, I wanted to check it out.  While not a carbon copy of it, I can see how it clearly echoed it.  It does utilize the shaky camera, though not quite to the extent of Blair Witch.  Cannibal Holocaust, though I haven't seen it in its entirety, is probably a much closer match due to the fact the footage was found, but let's get back to this one.  This movie, made in 1972, was a kind of ""In Search of"" like movie that concerned a big-foot like creature haunting the swamps around Fouke, Arkansas.  It was produced on a micro budget of only 100,000.  The movie has lots of lush scenery, and fluid tracking shots near the beginning, as they glide down the swamps on a boat. The main complaint I have is the songs. Yes, you heard me right.  There are a few songs strummed on a guitar, but fortunately, you can always fast forward.  Well, let me get to my verdict on if I liked it or not.  Overall, it's not bad.  The best scenes are when the monster is sneaking up on a family in a farmhouse, and peaking in windows.  But the bad thing is the movie is often boring.  I don't find it particularly scary either, and the monster is obviously a man in a suit.  Some mumbled the same about the Blair Witch(I wasn't scared by this movie either, I just found it interesting), but to me, the sense of boredom is worse here, though they both clock in at around a measly 90 minute running time.  I think the difference is the songs (particularly the ditty about Young Jim.  Oh, my poor ears!)and the long pauses between when the beast shows itself, and when it disappears for a while.  But, this movie does deserve credit for being the first movie to be shot in this manner.

If you are expecting this film to have you jumping out of your seat with fright then forget about it too. This is not what the film does. It lingers with you psychologically long after you have seen it and you will think twice about taking a walk in the woods as you would taking a swim after seeing ""Jaws"".Basically it is a family documentary, with a universal rating but it is certainly not for kids.. which is how most people remember seeing it in the first place and explains why it gave them nightmares. Looking back I can see how many people can say that it was a truly frightful experience watching this movie... if you where 12 years old.

If you are a parent then I am sure that this film will have your kid more interested in science and zoology than a trip to the local zoo park.The film makers establish this little backward town out in the middle of nowhere and you get to see and listen too some very strange characters that look like they just hopped out of the movie ""Deliverance"" or ""Southern Comfort"". Then you start to hear them talk about this strange creature that just happened to be out in the woods, or making a racket in their barn, or running around the outside of their house raising all sorts of hell. Many of the different stories about the creature are reenacted but these can be a little corny at times. The print is also shockingly bad, but I think it was probably shot on 16mm or the original has gone through a lot of wear and tear.All in all I would have to give this docu-drama 5 stars for a least documenting the local townsfolk of  Fouke, Arkansas. That alone is gold. There was also this trapper man who lived way out in the middle of a swamp and looks like some sort of a redneck guru.

Boggy Creek is a very boring and nearly unwatchable movie from the 1970's that does nothing to build the suspense, mood or atmosphere that would be related to the mystery of Bigfoot sightings.

On the contrary, &quot;The Legend of Boggy Creek&quot; is a grade B movie at best. The four stars above are based on the fact that &quot;The Legend of Boggy Creek&quot; has stood the test of time for this viewer. I first saw this &quot;docudrama&quot; about the Fouke, Arkansas member of the bigfoot clan on TV as a kid. Repeated viewings over the years have not dulled the late night enchantment of that first time.Produced in the early 1970's, &quot;The Legend of Boggy Creek&quot; is the documentary reminiscence of an unnamed and perhaps fictional narrator. The cast of unknowns and real people lend an air of credibility to the dramatizations of supposed actual encounters with the smelly, three toed, hairy hominid said to have stalked Boggy Creek. When it comes time to reveal the monster to the camera, the film makers were savvy enough to make most of his shots shadowy and/or distant. You know it is a man in a suit but you may find yourself wondering if there was (or is) an actual creature out there in the bottom lands of Arkansas.If you have not already seen &quot;The Legend of Boggy Creek&quot; you may want to look for it on TV before buying.

323615,A1SJMPOW1DPCAJ,6302623294,scotbot,"[6, 7]","The Legend of Boggy Creek is not a documentary, nor is it a grotesque horror flick or mundane drama. It's a love song dedicated to that venerable American icon, the Sasquatch, and it's a safe and enjoyable scary movie for youngsters. This tale brings us back to a time when we were able believe in such intriguing and terrifying creatures as Bigfoot. The narrator invites us to take that nostalgic journey as he recalls and recreates the ""real life"" events that occurred during his childhood in Fouke, Arkansas and connects them to more contemporary (1970s) sightings. Quaint farm folk provide eyewitness accounts of the wild man's antics in interviews conducted by the filmmaker. This documentary style lends a sort of dodgy legitimacy to the legend as well as the vague feeling that you are watching a 16mm wildlife film in an elementary biology class. This approach soon gives way to several other narrative modes such as over-dramatization and bumpkin balladry. The overall direction is just as unpredictable and uneven; going from poorly filmed and confusingly edited dialog sequences to poetic, atmospheric shots of the hauntingly beautiful environment. The acting, music and other aspects of the film are of the extremely low budget variety. If you can manage to look past the film's many faults, you can come out with some memorable moments though. At the very least, it can be quite funny when watched with a critical eye. However, with a more forgiving view one can appreciate this film's heartfelt homage to the fascinating and frightening mysteries of the Legend of Boggy Creek.This DVD is a no frills sort of affair, but it beats trying to watch a chewed up old VHS recording of the same print. It's probably a two star film that gets a couple of extra stars out of me for purely nostalgic reasons, but since it works as both a thriller for the young viewers and an unintentionally funny cheese flick for others, it deserves about three and a half stars.BTW - The movie being quite accurately described by reviewer T.

A movie buff even then, I never had the slightest desire to see it.  After hearing him speak of it for so long, I finally got the 'opportunity' to see it maybe 15 years later.  It was as cheap and crap as I'd always thought it would be, which leaves me mystified as to what people see in this colossal mess.  Just last night I picked up the DVD from the bargain bin - just in case my cynicism got the best of me when I was younger, I could view it more objectively now.  But let's call a spade a spade: this is a very bad film with zero production values, zero acting skills, zero sound quality, amateurish lighting, murkish visual style...heck, even the DVD edition is devoid of credibility!  Choose Production Notes from the menu to be taken to two pictures beside each other.  Huh?!?  And there's an actual Photo Gallery on the disc which is very small and adds nothing.Another review I read suggested holding out for a widescreen version, but don't bother. This film was shot in 16mm, then blown-up to 35mm. An anamorphic (2.35 : 1) print was out there, but it's just cropped, so a widescreen edition would actually be less.

323634,A1JJK67VXR1WSR,6302623294,William R. Hancock,"[14, 16]","First off, let's deal with what's true and not true here. The first thing is the title, ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"".As anyone in that part of Arkansas can tell you, Boggy Creek had no more affinity with ""The Monster"" than any number of creeks or branches in the area. Nor was there any ""legend"" (explanatory backstory) applied to that creek (and no legend at all applied to the Big Hairy Monster...it was just around the county for no known reason). Charles Pierce, the producer , just simply took a fancy to the ""wilderness""-sounding name of that one stream and hooked it up with ""Legend"" because it all went together for a ""catchy"" title that he thought would have box office appeal.He was right. It did.Nor was the ""thing"" known originally as the ""Fouke Monster"".It's appearances had mostly been reported in a little community outside of Fouke called Jonesville, where area people referred to it as the ""Jonesville Monster"". In the early 70s, when there was a small flood of sightings out Jonesville way (particularly around the land holdings of an extended family named Crabtree),the local paper in Fouke began printing articles about the thing and these articles were picked up by news services. Because of the Fouke bylines in the press the ""Jonesville"" Monster soon got turned...against his will, no doubt...into the ""Fouke"" Monster.And Charles Pierce saw the possibility of turning Mr. Monster a bright shade of ""money green"" in investment potential.Factually, the ""whatsit"" never really did anything more than be seen by hunters (mostly assorted Crabtrees, as he showed a partiality towards their lands above others),harass dogs, get shot at, shot,stampede horses ( for ""kicks""?), wander around screaming and screeching in the bottoms, and get spotted crossing the highway every now and then by motoristsand school bus drivers. Kinda scary? Yes, true enough...but apartfrom an alledged hog snatching on one occasion...the thing never did anything aggressive that was known to anyone. ""Ahhhh"", you say,"" then what about the Searcy incident with the cat? And the attack on the two couples in the house?"".Well all that actually happened with Mary Beth Searcy and her family was that the thing seemingly came to the edge of the yard and watched them and she saw it through the window and was screamingly terrified by it. What did IT do? Nothing really. This is nothing more, really, than a little goose-pimpler of a story. Pierce ""juices"" the incident, however, with the inclusion of a purely fabricated fiction (Searcys say it never happened)about the family's new kitten being scared to death (literally) by the booger...with a freeze-frame in the movie of a dead cat's wide-eyed face. A clever touch, but misleading.The big whoop-ti-do of the movie is, of course, the ""night seige"" of house of the two young couples, where the thing makes repeated appearances around the house and the home defenders have to rush out to defend themselves with shotguns. This sequence ""makes' the movie, pretty much...and hangs a note of fear onto the image of the monster.The truth, which the movie does NOT tell you, is much more prosaic. A local in the area had an old horse that was considered ornery and about half crazy. This horse was good about getting out of his pasture at night and running around the neighborhood raising a ruckus (snorts, squeals, etc.). He would get into people's flower beds and tear them up and do all sorts of things. Kept the neighbors complaining and irritated at his owner.In any event, that basket-case horse got out that night and went on one of his rants over near the Ford place ( site of the ""night attack""...where the young folks had to blast the Fouke Monster with a shotgun to save themselves). It became a known fact locally that the horse was out there that night...because they FOUND him there the next morning..fairly close to the house...dead of a shotgun blast.But Charles Pierce (unlike Paul Harvey) is somewhat dishonestly disinclined to tell you ""the rest of the story"" in his movie. Heck, that would SPOIL the EFFECT!!! And might pull down the box office potential!As a movie, ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is quite entertaining.The overall use of non-actors and real locations and the photography and editing make it look like a real documentary (as does the cooked up narration that makes it seem it is being told by some reflective local). And it IS at least adocumentary of sorts (all the Crabtree incidents are seemingly recounted pretty much as they occurred, and the same with Searcy except for the cat business). The ""Night Seige"" is largely true (except for the discovery of the dead horse), and DOES pretty accurately depict how adrenalin-pumping panic can work on the imagination at night. The people really were scared and really trying to defend thermselves from...something. It just appears from subsequent discovery that the ""something' WASN'T the Fouke Monster. But presenting it as Pierce did, though, was GREAT cinema!!!Was there/is there a ""creature"" there in Miller County? I'd say so. Such things are seen from the Florida Everglades on across the Gulf states to Texas ( The Big Thicket country is the ""stomping ground"" of ""Ol' Mossyback the Wildman"" and the Honey Island Swamp Monster in Louisiana MAY be kin). A bigsomething ran around South Carolina's coastal Fripp Island back in the 30s and 40s. Called ""Old Salt"", it ran through a Coast Guard barracks staffed with beach patrollers one night...in the front door, out the back...and had all those worthy gentlemen in agitated excitement. From Pennsylvania to West Virginia, on to Wyoming, Idaho, and the Pacific coast, the sightings have occurred.People pay more attention to this enigma now, and for a lot of them this stems from seeing ""Boggy Creek"" on the silver screen years ago. It is an intriguing movie, cleverly assembled, and it can still raise the hackles a bit when you watch it. Definitely worth a look, for nostalgia value...and for for mental chew-food on what may or may not be out there in the ""real"" world.",4,"Entertaining ""Half Truth""
