I am sad to know that there are only six seasons to watch because I have become absolutely addicted to this show. How did I miss it when it was first on TV?The premise behind this show is science and math and crime fighting. There are two brothers that share the main spotlight. One is very very smart in math and science. He is a genius with some of the social awkwardness and other problems that come with genius level smarts. The other one, Don, an average in the academic area and has fewer social problems. Don is an FBI man in charge of a unit, and he puts his life on the line solving crimes each day.The idea behind this show is that Don recruits his brother, the genius, Charlie to help solve the crime using math.One of the things I like is that most of the characters are very likable. They are enjoyable to watch and it is nice to watch their interactions. I also like the supporting cast. Most of the characters seem very true to life as well. The one exception to this would be Charlie. While there are geniuses it seems that the tv show has him writing too fast, solving problems to quickly. Many of the problems and programming plans he whips up would take much longer than it does for Charlie. But I guess that is TV for you.Another thing that I have found fascinating is that just about all of these shows are based on true stories.I also find it fun to listen to the other names mentioned and find references to other great mathematicians.Watching this show has made me feel smarter.

977934,A11GO5VA74HD8K,B000ERVJKE,Crazy Fox,"[43, 44]","Yes, this is a great TV show--and I don't say this lightly. I'm not much of a TV watcher generally speaking, but ""Numb3rs"" has really impressed me as a quality show from the get-go. My spouse and I always make it a point to be home Friday night to catch the latest episode, so we were both pretty excited that season one has been released on DVD. Since we don't have cable, and surrounding high-rise buildings hinder antenna reception (ah, yes, life in the big city), it has been especially nice to see the episodes again, only this time in clear and crisp digital.So what makes this show so good? Lots of things, I suppose. I particularly like the combination of Charlie and Don as a crime-fighting team, their skills and personalities complimenting each other. With Charlie you get the latest incarnation of the classic figure of the detective who uses reason and logic to solve the crime (going all the way back to Edgar Allan Poe's Dupin in ""The Purloined Letter"" not to mention Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes), and with Don you of course get the cop with a badge and a gun who saves the day (a mainstay of American TV for decades). That said, both actors flesh these archetypes out really well into individual characters, and their brotherly interaction (with a dash of sibling rivalry) creates just the right dynamic.The math angle is handled extremely well, too. My spouse the mathematician assures me that the higher math Charlie spouts is for real (even if it can't quite catch the bad guys quite so efficiently--cue temporary suspension of disbelief here), and yet for a humanities type like me who knows just enough math to unbalance the checkbook the show's writers and producers do a fine job of translating such mathematics into terms that make sense to the non-expert, often using visual asides to illustrate the principles involved in clever, creative ways. In general, too, the atmosphere and character of academia (with Charlie's physicist friend and all) is portrayed pretty accurately and authentically, which is extremely rare for TV shows...and movies, for that matter.Finally, on the more basic level, there is just the good old-fashioned pure enjoyment of watching the good guys catch the bad guys.To make a long story short (I know, too late), this is a fine TV show that is well worth having in one's collection of DVDs.",5,It All Adds Up,1149206400,"06 2, 2006",2006,2352,"['Yes', 'great', 'TV', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'lightly', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'TV', 'watcher', 'generally', 'speaking', 'Numb3rs', 'really', 'impressed', 'quality', 'show', 'get-go', 'spouse', 'always', 'make', 'point', 'be', 'home', 'Friday', 'night', 'catch', 'latest', 'episode', 'were', 'pretty', 'excited', 'season', 'one', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'cable', 'surrounding', 'high-rise', 'buildings', 'hinder', 'antenna', 'reception', 'ah', 'yes', 'life', 'big', 'city', 'been', 'especially', 'nice', 'see', 'episodes', 'again', 'only', 'time', 'clear', 'crisp', 'digital.So', 'what', 'show', 'so', 'good', 'Lots', 'things', 'suppose', 'particularly', 'combination', 'Charlie', 'Don', 'crime-fighting', 'team', 'skills', 'personalities', 'complimenting', 'other', 'Charlie', 'get', 'latest', 'incarnation', 'classic', 'figure', 'detective', 'who', 'reason', 'logic', 'solve', 'crime', 'going', 'way', 'back', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'Dupin', 'Purloined', 'Letter', 'not', 'mention', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Don', 'course', 'get', 'cop', 'badge', 'gun', 'who', 'day', 'mainstay', 'American', 'TV', 'decades', 'said', 'actors', 'flesh', 'archetypes', 'out', 'really', 'well', 'individual', 'characters', 'brotherly', 'interaction', 'dash', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'just', 'right', 'dynamic.The', 'math', 'angle', 'handled', 'extremely', 'well', 'too', 'My', 'spouse', 'mathematician', 'assures', 'higher', 'math', 'Charlie', 'real', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'catch', 'bad', 'guys', 'quite', 'so', 'efficiently', 'cue', 'temporary', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'here', 'yet', 'humanities', 'type', 'who', 'just', 'enough', 'math', 'unbalance', 'checkbook', 'show', 'writers', 'producers', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'translating', 'such', 'mathematics', 'terms', 'make', 'sense', 'non-expert', 'often', 'using', 'visual', 'asides', 'illustrate', 'principles', 'involved', 'clever', 'creative', 'ways', 'general', 'too', 'atmosphere', 'character', 'academia', 'Charlie', 'physicist', 'friend', 'portrayed', 'pretty', 'accurately', 'authentically', 'extremely', 'rare', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies', 'matter.Finally', 'more', 'basic', 'level', 'just', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'pure', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'good', 'guys', 'catch', 'bad', 'guys.To', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'know', 'too', 'late', 'fine', 'TV', 'show', 'well', 'worth', 'having', 'one', 'collection', 'DVDs']",Numb3rs - The Complete First Season

This season includes 13 episodes (4 episodes per disc except the 4th disc, which has 1 episode and some special features). To sum it up, Numb3rs is about two brothers: one works for the FBI and the other is a Caltech mathematician who helps his brother solve some of his cases using math. This description may sound a bit dry, but take my word for it, the chemistry between these actors (and their father, co-workers, and love interests) is very interesting and believable.

For five years on Friday nights, the CBS show ""Numb3rs"" helped show the general public how math is used in law enforcement.""Numb3rs"" is set in Los Angeles.  FBI agent Don Eppes (Rob Morrow) encounters many crime cases that can be solved with the help of mathematics, and his brother Charlie (David Krumholtz) is a mathematician who provides the number know-how needed to nab the criminals.  The 13 episodes comprising this first season of the series were originally broadcast in the first five months of 2005--some of the crimes that Don and Charlie team up to solve in the first season include kidnapping, murder, bank robbery, counterfeiting, sniper killings, and even a jail break.This DVD set includes all 13 episodes and some bonus material concerning the development and casting of the series.  There is one flaw on this set--on the second disc, if you attempt to play the ""Counterfeit Reality"" episode from the main menu, the wrong episode plays.  The workaround to this conundrum is to use the Play All option and use the chapter fast-forward button on your remote--eventually you will hit the ""Counterfeit Reality"" episode and it will play successfully.Morrow and Krumholtz play their roles perfectly, and the supporting cast is outstanding as well, including Judd Hirsch as Alan, the father of Don and Charlie.  The characters are likable and have great chemistry in a low-key sort of way.  ""Numb3rs"" is great television.  I regretted that I never tuned into the series until last March 12 (which turned out to be the series finale!) but am glad that the series is available on DVD.

It is intelligent, well written, and interesting on many levels. The storyline follows a brilliant mathematician from CalTech, Charlie, and his brother Don, an FBI agent, as Don relies on Charlies help to solve crime in Los Angeles.The cast works beautifully together. David Krumholtz as Charlie, Rob Morrow as Don, and the incredible Judd Hirsch as their long-suffering father Alan, handle not only the work issues between Charlie and Don. They also work through the family issues of a family with a jock and a brilliant scientific mind growing up together. Charlie, four years younger than Don, graduate high school together, and Charlie goes off to MIT, taking the mom with him, as Don fights his jealousy of the time that the family puts in on a younger brother who requires intensive education to keep up with his brilliance from the age of three.The thing I don't like about the show? Don't spoiled, temperamental self-centered attitude. Even thought Charlie has higher government clearance than Don (he consults for the NSA) he still tries to bully Charlie, pushing him around and lording his FBI status over Charlie. Sigh.Overall?

At least once in each show, we are treated to Dr. Eppes' explanation of how he applied math to help solve the problem.  He uses comparisons, common life situations, and even the occasional story to enlighten us without making us feel lectured or foolish.  The graphics interjected by the show's producers while he talks adds to the affect, though I wonder how the poor FBI agents survive without them!The interaction and relationships among the characters adds to the show's appeal.  These brothers are, well, brothers--loving, supportive, and also competitive.  Parental flavor is added by both dad (Alan Eppes played by Judd Hirsch) and Charlie's mentor and friend, physicist Dr. Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNichol).

It doesn't always make sense to us &#34;regular&#34; folk, but eventually we catch on.  Got to love the analogies.  Charlie works with his brother, Don (Rob Morrow), an agent with the FBI.  Charlie finds the bad guy, Don arrests him.  Ying and Yang.  The family dynamic is completed with the father figure, Alan (played by Judd Hirsch).  He's a very smart individual who's always looking to learn and broaden his horizons.  He keeps both of his sons on their toes, corrects childhood memories, explains others.  A good papa.

Not meaning to cast stones, but the mediocre ones are the television equivalent of cotton candy.  There are a few (The Mentalist) that almost, but don't QUITE reach the highest heights.Right now there are two ""cop shows"" that started with a unique angle, then added great casts and writing.  In my mind ""NUMB3RS"" joins ""Dexter"" at the top of the current police heap.Both have writing - dialogue and storylines - that easily match up with the best cop movies.  (Why couldn't someone have provided a better vehicle for Pacino and De Niro than ""Righteous Kill"", which looks like a high-school production compared to Dexter and Numbers?)  But I digress.NUMB3RS is the ""genius"" drama. (The Big Bang Theory is the genius comedy, and it really IS comic genius.)  Rob Morrow, from another of our favorite shows, Northern Exposure, shows impressive range.  On NE his Dr. Fleischman was a slight of stature New York Doctor transplanted to Alaska.  In NUMB3RS he plays Don Eppes, a tough dedicated-to-his-career FBI professional with commanding stature. Almost every episode features Don and a team of FBI professionals storming a room with weapons brandished.  On ""Exposure"" he played the intellectual.  Although Eppes is not dumb - he's an observant professional - Don is easily the least intelligent of the leading characters.  Don's math genius brother is Charles, played by David Krumholtz.  Five years younger than Don, Charles has become an internationally renowned mathematician.  The sibling rivalry angle provides many plot points, and we see goes back to the time that Charles graduated in the same high school class as Don - only at age thirteen.Charles, now 30-ish, still lives at home with their father, played brilliantly with heart and intelligence by Judd Hirsch.Don was building his federal law enforcement career away from home until their now deceased mother became sick.  The series begins apparently soon after their mother's death, leaving a house with two men, frequently visited by still-single brother Don.Alimi Ballard is solid as a fellow FBI man, and Navi Rawat looks like a young Catherine Zeta-Jones as a graduate student who studies under Charlie. Peter MacNicol gets another hit TV show (after Ally McBeal and 24) as a physicist colleague of Charlie.The show is equal parts brains and heart - contemplation and action.

I also enjoy that I can watch this with my 80 year old prude of a mother without blushing.While those are the things that will keep me watching into season 2 I feel compelled to add that although I like the characters and while there is chemistry between them I don't ""care"" about them as individuals. Even after a complete season if something happened to one of the main characters it wouldn't be a big deal. This may be because the show dwells very little on the characters as ""real people"", you get little snippets of seeing their human vulnerabilities but not much. It may be this aspect that has made it impossible for ""suspension of disbelief"" to occur. Without this natural tendency to ignore inconsistencies that appear in stories I spend the entire show thinking, ""Oh, right, it's no problem to build a totally new working mathematical model with no time"" or ""Oh, he's a prodigy so he's good at just about anything.""It's a good show I just hope it'll become a great show.",3,Good but something is just missing,1269302400,"03 23, 2010",2010,1229,"['found', 'numb3rs', 'was', 'desperate', 'something', 'new', 'loved', 'math', 'slant', 'story', 'lines', 'acting', 'are', 'good', 'Listening', 'mathematical', 'principles', 'broken', 'down', 'day', 'talk', 'fun', 'seeing', 'ultimate', 'usefulness', 'math', 'nifty', 'also', 'enjoy', 'can', 'watch', '80', 'year', 'old', 'prude', 'mother', 'are', 'things', 'will', 'keep', 'watching', 'season', '2', 'feel', 'compelled', 'add', 'like', 'characters', 'chemistry', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'about', 'individuals', 'Even', 'complete', 'season', 'something', 'happened', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'big', 'deal', 'may', 'be', 'show', 'very', 'little', 'characters', 'real', 'people', 'get', 'little', 'snippets', 'seeing', 'human', 'vulnerabilities', 'not', 'much', 'may', 'be', 'aspect', 'made', 'impossible', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'occur', 'natural', 'tendency', 'ignore', 'inconsistencies', 'appear', 'stories', 'spend', 'entire', 'show', 'thinking', 'Oh', 'right', 'problem', 'build', 'totally', 'new', 'working', 'mathematical', 'model', 'time', 'Oh', 'prodigy', 'good', 'just', 'anything', 'good', 'show', 'just', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'become', 'great', 'show']",Numb3rs - The Complete First Season

Numb3rs is a strong balance of bicep and brain, and I'm hopeful that future seasons continue what they've done in S1.",5,anything but by-the-numbers,1254009600,"09 27, 2009",2009,1025,"['only', 'recently', 'discovered', 'Numb3rs', 'being', 'late', 'game', 'ca', ""n't"", 'plant', 'I-was-watching-this-before-anyone-else', 'flag', 'are', 'had', 'heard', 'series', 'maybe', 'caught', 'episode', 'here', 'there', 'TV', 'never', 'really', 'gave', 'shot', 'DO', 'IT.I', 'dont', 'know', 'why', 'avoided', 'so', 'long', 'great', 'great', 'crime', 'drama', 'strong', 'human', 'element', 'Yes', 'plenty', 'action', 'go', 'around', 'Numb3rs', 'also', 'cerebral', 'ways', 'number', 'theory', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'solve', 'very', 'little', 'not', 'like', 'show', 'times', 'Feds', 'make', 'decisions', 'would', 'surmise', 'real', 'FBI', 'agents', 'would', 'not', 'huge', 'mistakes', 'protocol', 'drama', 'show', 'pull', 'believability', 'Still', 'totally', 'forgive', 'lapses', 'really', 'enjoy', 'honesty', 'down-to-earth', 'nature', 'characters', 'show', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'using', 'Einstein-level', 'jargon', 'Numb3rs', 'strong', 'balance', 'bicep', 'brain', ""'m"", 'hopeful', 'future', 'seasons', 'continue', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'S1']",Numb3rs - The Complete First Season
