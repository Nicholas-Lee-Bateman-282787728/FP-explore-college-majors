1095176,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000UJ48R2,calvinnme,"[35, 41]","The following is a description of the films in this Signature Collection dedicated to the talents of Burt Lancaster:Flame and the Arrow (1950) - This is an enjoyable swashbuckling type of film set in the 12th century. For some reason, when the local overlord stole Dardo's (Lancaster's) wife he does nothing, but when his son is taken from him he finally decides to take action. This film is important for two reasons - a. because it is fun and full of action b. because it revived Lancaster's career after he had been type-cast for several years as less than bright villains in film noir films. Lancaster purchased and produced this film himself, and as a result of it we got to see him as Elmer Gantry and Sgt. Milton Warden later on.Jim Thorpe - All American (1951) - This is a very good biopic and the best film in the set, in my opinion. Lancaster plays Thorpe, a Native American athlete who loses his Olympic gold medals when it is learned he played two seasons of minor league baseball prior to competing, thus violating his amateur status. This is a turning point in his life, and his marriage ends and he feels his dream of coaching as a career will never be. The film ends before the truly sad years in Thorpe's life begin, when he is truly broke.South Sea Woman (1953) - Lancaster plays Marine Sergeant James O'Hearn who is being court martialed during World War II when he arrives in Pearl Harbor after the Japanese attack and has no excuse for his absence up to that point. He refuses to defend himself. A showgirl takes the stand in his defense and tells the court that O'Hearn is really just standing up for a buddy of his, one who is really guilty of the scandalous behavior.His Majesty O'Keefe (1954) - Probably the weakest film in the set, but still above average. After a mutiny, ship captain O'Keefe (Lancaster) winds up on the island of Yap. There is a fortune to be made in cocoanut there, and meanwhile the local islanders have made O'Keefe their king based on a local legend and their mistaken belief in who he represents. O'Keefe has two problems - the islanders don't want to work at harvesting the cocoanut and the Germans already ""own the rights"" to the cocoanut trade there. Nice little action film with a charming performance by Lancaster.Executive Action (1973) - Made about the time of Watergate as people began to be much less trustful of government, this is one of the first films to address the possibility that what the public was told about the Kennedy assassination might have been less than truthful. Much of what was in the film JFK is presented here, both rightly and wrongly, but the larger more complex conspiracy theory that was floated in JFK is not. That is probably because in 1973 people were just beginning to reevaluate this whole issue. At any rate, it is a very good film and worth revisiting.I don't have any information on extra features other than that they will be ""Oscar-nominated vintage shorts, vintage featurettes and classic cartoons."" In other words, I am not expecting biographical material. One real question I have is why is ""The Twilight's Last Gleaming"" not included? Warner Home Video has the rights to it, and it is better than any picture in this set. Considering Burt Lancaster did his best-known work at other studios, you'd think they would bother to include it in a Signature Collection of the actor's better works. Thus I can only give this collection four stars. In fact, it is probably between 3.5 and 4 stars given the information I have and no knowledge if there will even be any commentary included on the films.",4,An OK collection but nothing to get excited over,1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,3592,"['following', 'description', 'films', 'Signature', 'Collection', 'dedicated', 'talents', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Flame', 'Arrow', '1950', 'enjoyable', 'swashbuckling', 'type', 'film', 'set', '12th', 'century', 'reason', 'when', 'local', 'overlord', 'stole', 'Dardo', 'Lancaster', 'wife', 'nothing', 'when', 'son', 'taken', 'finally', 'take', 'action', 'film', 'important', 'two', 'reasons', 'a.', 'fun', 'full', 'action', 'b.', 'revived', 'Lancaster', 'career', 'had', 'been', 'type-cast', 'several', 'years', 'less', 'bright', 'villains', 'film', 'noir', 'films', 'Lancaster', 'purchased', 'produced', 'film', 'result', 'got', 'see', 'Elmer', 'Gantry', 'Sgt', 'Milton', 'Warden', 'later', 'on.Jim', 'Thorpe', 'American', '1951', 'very', 'good', 'biopic', 'best', 'film', 'set', 'opinion', 'Lancaster', 'Thorpe', 'Native', 'American', 'athlete', 'who', 'Olympic', 'gold', 'medals', 'when', 'learned', 'played', 'two', 'seasons', 'minor', 'league', 'baseball', 'prior', 'competing', 'thus', 'violating', 'amateur', 'status', 'turning', 'point', 'life', 'marriage', 'ends', 'dream', 'coaching', 'career', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'film', 'truly', 'sad', 'years', 'Thorpe', 'life', 'begin', 'when', 'truly', 'broke.South', 'Sea', 'Woman', '1953', 'Lancaster', 'Marine', 'Sergeant', 'James', ""O'Hearn"", 'who', 'being', 'court', 'martialed', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'when', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Japanese', 'attack', 'excuse', 'absence', 'up', 'point', 'defend', 'showgirl', 'stand', 'defense', 'court', ""O'Hearn"", 'really', 'just', 'standing', 'up', 'buddy', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'guilty', 'scandalous', 'behavior.His', 'Majesty', ""O'Keefe"", '1954', 'Probably', 'weakest', 'film', 'set', 'still', 'above', 'average', 'mutiny', 'ship', 'captain', ""O'Keefe"", 'Lancaster', 'up', 'island', 'Yap', 'fortune', 'be', 'made', 'cocoanut', 'there', 'meanwhile', 'local', 'islanders', 'have', 'made', ""O'Keefe"", 'king', 'based', 'local', 'legend', 'mistaken', 'belief', 'who', ""O'Keefe"", 'two', 'problems', 'islanders', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'work', 'harvesting', 'cocoanut', 'Germans', 'already', 'rights', 'cocoanut', 'trade', 'there', 'Nice', 'little', 'action', 'film', 'charming', 'performance', 'Lancaster.Executive', 'Action', '1973', 'Made', 'time', 'Watergate', 'people', 'began', 'be', 'much', 'less', 'trustful', 'government', 'one', 'first', 'films', 'address', 'possibility', 'what', 'public', 'was', 'told', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'truthful', 'Much', 'what', 'was', 'film', 'JFK', 'presented', 'here', 'rightly', 'wrongly', 'larger', 'more', 'complex', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'was', 'floated', 'JFK', 'not', 'probably', '1973', 'people', 'were', 'just', 'beginning', 'reevaluate', 'whole', 'issue', 'rate', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'worth', 'revisiting.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'information', 'extra', 'features', 'other', 'will', 'be', 'Oscar-nominated', 'vintage', 'shorts', 'vintage', 'featurettes', 'classic', 'cartoons', 'other', 'words', 'am', 'not', 'expecting', 'biographical', 'material', 'One', 'real', 'question', 'have', 'why', 'Twilight', 'Last', 'Gleaming', 'not', 'included', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'rights', 'better', 'picture', 'set', 'Considering', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'did', 'best-known', 'work', 'other', 'studios', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'bother', 'include', 'Signature', 'Collection', 'actor', 'better', 'works', 'Thus', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'collection', 'four', 'stars', 'fact', 'probably', '3.5', '4', 'stars', 'given', 'information', 'have', 'knowledge', 'will', 'even', 'be', 'commentary', 'included', 'films']",Burt Lancaster - The Signature Collection: (The Flame and the Arrow / Jim Thorpe All-American / His Majesty O'Keefe / South Sea Woman / Executive Action)
