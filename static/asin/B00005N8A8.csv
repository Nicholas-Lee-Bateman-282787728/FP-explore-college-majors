Its a show about some college kids who go partying at some place out in the country like a barn club then the trouble starts from there, these satanists track down these kids and they try to escape and report it, and warn everyone. The only star I can think of in this is patrick bergin who I think is a really good actor.  Though it was goofy to see him be disguised as a priest and run a church and to hide his true cover to be a leader of a satanic cult.  The movie is excellent though, good picture and filming, excellent acting, and very exciting to watch.  Since this is a b-movie nobody is probably going to write a review for along time but people if u like freaky movies go rent this one its really awesome and even really sexy.

666973,A1W0ODR0SK9H4R,B00005N8A8,LeftManOut,"[5, 7]","Somewhere inside me there's always going to be a place for lesser known horror movies. Whether they be low budget b-movies (Shark Attack 2!), horribly written 80's slasher flicks (oh Slumber Party Massacre), or just downright awful attempts at being scary and coming off incredibly cheesy (my god Cheerleader Camp). For some reason I just seem to be drawn to these movies. They are by no means the best films ever created, but there's something about them that distinctly separates them from the Hollywood mass. ""Devil's Prey"" is one of those films. Truth be told the only reason I even decided to watch this movie was because it was a Lion's Gate Films movie, and to my knowledge I have never seen a LGF film I didn't like. And after the 88 minutes of ""Devil's Prey"" are over, I felt the exact same way I did when I watched other LGF films like ""Cabin Fever"" and ""100 Girls"". While it has its fair share of problems, ""Devil's Prey"" will be an entertaining viewing experience for anyone interested in the horror/suspense genre of films, or who has come to be interested in one of the finest film companies around. But please don't expect this movie to be ground breaking or utterly unique.The story follows a group of five friends, Joe, Eric, Chris, Susan and Sam, who after getting off work for the night get an invitation to a rave being held out in the middle of nowhere from a person passing them out on the street. Unfortunately for them they decide to take the people up on their open invitation and head out to the party. While each has their own motivations for attending the rave(Chris (Craig Dawson) to sell drugs, Joe (Rashaan Nall) to hook up with girls, Same (Jennifer Lyons) to hook up with guys) no one could have expected what they would be getting themselves into. After getting into a fight at the rave, the five leave and proceed to head home, until a mysterious van begins stalking them and attempts to run them off the road. After narrowly escaping the van, the five accidently ""run"" into Fawn (the incredibly sexy Elena Lyons) who claims to have escaped from the group who was chasing the five. Turns out the people after them are called ""The Shadows"", a group of Satanists whom intended to sacrifice Fawn to Lucifer. The five take Fawn with them, only to run into The Shadows yet again, and have their car destroyed. Turns out The Shadows not only want Fawn, but Susan and Sam as well. From there the group must do anything to survive and get help for not only themselves, but the now badly injured Fawn. And of course you know more than a few of them are going to lose their lives in the process.For a script that looks like this, you could almost imagine this movie would be absolutely terrible. However the writers took the idea and simply ran with it. The end result was a fairly well (not astounding though) written plot, that has many twists and turns, and will constantly keep you guessing right up until the climax. There were quite a bit of moments in the movie where I found myself extremely surprised and pleased, although after thinking about it afterwards, I should have obviously seen it coming. The three main actresses, Ashley Jones (Susan), Jennifer Lyons (Sam) and Elena Lyons (Fawn), are all extremely talented, and very nice to look at for the whole movie. The three main actors, Eric (Bryan Kirkwood), Chris (Craig Dawson) and Joe (Rashaan Nall), do well with their roles. Overall the acting talent is not bad, especially for the cast being more or less unknown. The parts of each character aren't necessarily the most well written, but the actors attempt to do what they can with what they're given, and it works pretty well. There's not a lot of graphic violence (some occasional murders with a large knife and such), but there are a few suspenseful moments which make the movie much more enjoyable. Some of the violence also takes place off screen, which leaves your imagination to do the work on what really happened. This actually adds a lot to scenes like the intro or Joe's murder. The townspeople are also genuinely creepy. I mean I know the stupid redneck cult town idea is totally played out by now, but ""Devil's Prey"" knows the secrets to making it work it seems. One of my favorite lines of the movie is when the old waitress in the diner tells Chris and Sam, ""Don't worry you'll be eaten soon enough.""But the movie definitely has some problems. First it plays on cliches way too much. First you have your typical redneck town which the fivesome is forced to travel to after being stranded in the woods, and you can instantly tell that there is something up with everyone. There's the oblivious know it all sheriff who believes the kids were really behind it all and trying to cover up the murders (The happiest moment of the movie for me was when the Pastor shot him in the face, oh sweet justice). Also some things are just way too obviously stupid. I mean when Joe gets hit by the van in the road, his friends simply jump in the bushes off to the side, and let the shadows grab him and throw him in their van (where they eventually take him off and murder him). I don't know about you, but if a vicious group of satanic murders were chasing me and they were trying to take one of my friends away to potentially murder him or her, I would at least attempt to save them. Too bad they just watch. Poor Joe. Some of the violence is incredibly cheesy. When Fawn beats the Shadow member to death with the club, I couldn't help but laugh. Oh and the end scene with the Pastor is just hilarious. And don't get me started about ""The Shadows"" themselves. First not only do they wear the most incredibly cheesy masks of all time (only rivaled by the horrendous one in ""Valentine"") they carry no weapons or anything that would make them remotely intimidating. I mean I wouldn't run from a bunch of trick or treaters with flash lights, like the heroes in this movie do. Oh well. But if you can overlook these flaws, the movie is actually quite entertaining.Whether or not ""Devil's Prey"" is the best horror movie ever made, is not even an issue. It's not. It's not perfect either, but in the end, it's not really meant to be. Coming down too harshly on it like many reviewers have is really going to make you miss the good things about the film. It's not without its flaws, but ""Devil's Prey"" is a solid movie, from a great film company, that always makes films they know their fans will enjoy. I was and still am a huge LGF fan, and most likely will be for a long time. If there's a place in your heart for lesser known films, especially of the horror variety, then I would recommend this film with the utmost regard. Some can trash it or write it off, but those who do are missing the purpose that the film was made for, and that is to entertain. And on that note, this movie does just that.",4,Not As Bad As You Would Think,1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,6838,"['Somewhere', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'place', 'lesser', 'known', 'horror', 'movies',

Maybe that scene was accidentially edited out which would explain the confusion. I mean just from looking at them....one would never have guess they never did it before. I think they should just cut out the whole movie in the edit room because the movie is crap.Now before i go on, there is a scene where one of the would be victims took a rave partier dude into the back side barn and proceeds to make out with him in such a sinful way that you want to be that guy lol but it only last no more then 10 seconds before her bf came back there to break them up. And these worshippers think they are virgins LMAO...give me a break!The whole plan seem hard to believe anyways like the head satanic priestess ran in front of their car and get hit kinda badly....then pretending to be innocent and seeking help against those worshippers...nice huh. Now wouldn't it be nice if that car incident would of been worse where she turns up dead. Sigh...i'm not going to continue because this whole mess of a movie is hardly, even remotely, believable.

The girl gets a little bloody and loses her top to MJ, and then there's a bunch of plot before we get to a couple more girls being prepared for sacrifice or something, but nothing really happens, because as usual the girls get rescued.From a sleaze standpoint maybe one star for the opening scene, but there's really not much here at all.  There's lots of satanist films, and scores of starlets that get tied to altars, but hardly ever does anything really happen to them due to the pitiful security measures of the robed devil worshippers.

666978,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00005N8A8,Only-A-Child,"[1, 2]","""Devil's Prey"" (2001) is the first movie to show the brutal reality of devil worship and virgin sacrifice - dull, boring, and stupid. It is an amalgam of vile scenes scotch-taped together to form a motion picture. A gang of devil worshipers, led by Seth the local minister, doesn't like a gang of ravers, led by David (Charlie O'Connel). Driving away from the rave, David runs over Seth's girlfriend Fawn (Elena Lyons) who is mysteriously immune from blunt object trauma and who just gets into David's car.In retaliation Seth forces David's car off the road and Seth's friends hit Joe (one of David's closest friends) with their car; Joe too is mysteriously unhurt from the collision but loses his glasses. In retaliation David's gang begins killing a bunch of girls because they are dressed in long black robes and running around in the woods at night with sharp objects. In retaliation Seth's gang sacrifices Samantha (Jennifer Lyons) because she speaks with the voice of Rocky the Flying Squirrel and they figure she must be a virgin. There's a lot of avenging going on. By the end David's gang seems to have pretty much wiped out all the citizens of a small California town along with Seth and Fawn. But you can't be sure because they come back in one of those moronically tacked on endings.The movie nicely balances scenes of Jennifer Lyon's tight abs with charming shots of the little chapel in the dell, so there's something for everybody. But frankly, there just wasn't enough virgin sacrificing.But seriously, ""Devil's Prey"" may not be the worst ever example in the horror genre but you are unlikely to randomly chance on anything worse than this mess. It relies on its target audience's inability to recall misdirection devices that have been in use for decades. You immediately know that the seemingly normal townspeople are in league with the devil worshipers and that Fawn is their high priestess. Fawn's revelation is so predictable that even cheating by introducing impossible things that point in the opposite direction cannot disguise it.Devil's Prey is an illogical story lamely masked by confusing plot elements. It relies on poor lighting and minimal close-ups to mask poor performances and direction. There is a puzzling lack of intensity, suspense, and fast pacing as each scene seems to get mired down in extended shots-all this extra air apparently was necessary to get the running length up to 90 minutes although it seems like 290.Then again, what do I know?
