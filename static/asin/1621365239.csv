195183,A2X7PFXBXSZ5UQ,1621365239,Leo and Renee,"[8, 16]","First of all, I watched this movie with my family with no idea what to expect, except that we were told 'we had to watch it'.Without realizing this was based on the book (which was fictional), we thought that the stones were really passed out in NYC and some field in Pennsylvania.  Everyone in my family were staring at each other asking 'is this guy for real?'.  From other negative reviews, it sounds like the book doesn't do a good job either of distinguishing whether it is fictional or not.  I guess maybe we should have read the book first, but the person who gave us the DVD simply said to watch the DVD.Second, he makes the claim in the movie that when he wrote the book that he didn't even have to work because the book wrote itself, and therefore he can't take credit for the book.  Does this sound like a false prophet to you?  This is when we turned the movie off in disgust.  No one in my family was fooled and we were shocked that this movie (and book) received such great reviews.Third, he talks about the falling away of America, but never once mentions the remedy.  Never is Christ and the gospel of salvation talked about.  The collapse of a once great nation is an easy story to sell, and it appears Mr. Cahn has succeeded in selling it once again.  It is extremely troublesome to hear someone talk about the collapse of morals in our country but to never once mention the One and only remedy.  The wrath of God abides upon the heads of all men, and America is no exception, regardless of how pious our forefathers were.  Simply correcting our moral code will not solve Americas' problems.The movie offers very little new information that isn't already common knowledge, so this DVD doesn't even act as a informational documentary.  Typically when I watch a documentary, I expect something new and insightful.  This DVD doesn't even offer that.I highly recommend that new Christians do not watch this as it is a distraction.  You would be much better in getting a good study bible.",1,Very Deceptive,1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,2001,"['First', 'watched', 'movie', 'family', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'were', 'told', ""'we"", 'had', 'watch', ""it'.Without"", 'realizing', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'was', 'fictional', 'thought', 'stones', 'were', 'really', 'passed', 'out', 'NYC', 'field', 'Pennsylvania', 'Everyone', 'family', 'were', 'staring', 'other', 'asking', 'guy', 'real', 'other', 'negative', 'reviews', 'book', ""n't"", 'do', 'good', 'job', 'distinguishing', 'fictional', 'not', 'guess', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'person', 'who', 'gave', 'DVD', 'simply', 'said', 'watch', 'DVD.Second', 'claim', 'movie', 'when', 'wrote', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'work', 'book', 'wrote', 'therefore', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'credit', 'book', 'sound', 'false', 'prophet', 'when', 'turned', 'movie', 'off', 'disgust', 'one', 'family', 'was', 'fooled', 'were', 'shocked', 'movie', 'book', 'received', 'such', 'great', 'reviews.Third', 'falling', 'away', 'America', 'never', 'once', 'remedy', 'Never', 'Christ', 'gospel', 'salvation', 'talked', 'collapse', 'once', 'great', 'nation', 'easy', 'story', 'sell', 'Mr.', 'Cahn', 'succeeded', 'selling', 'once', 'again', 'extremely', 'troublesome', 'hear', 'someone', 'talk', 'collapse', 'morals', 'country', 'never', 'once', 'mention', 'One', 'only', 'remedy', 'wrath', 'God', 'heads', 'men', 'America', 'exception', 'regardless', 'how', 'pious', 'forefathers', 'were', 'Simply', 'correcting', 'moral', 'code', 'will', 'not', 'solve', 'Americas', 'problems.The', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'new', 'information', ""n't"", 'already', 'common', 'knowledge', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'even', 'act', 'informational', 'documentary', 'Typically', 'when', 'watch', 'documentary', 'expect', 'something', 'new', 'insightful', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'even', 'offer', 'that.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'new', 'Christians', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'distraction', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'getting', 'good', 'study', 'bible']",N/A
