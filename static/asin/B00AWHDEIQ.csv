1618004,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00AWHDEIQ,C. Sawin,"[10, 10]","Continuing with their Jackie Chan Double Feature collection, ""Police Story"" and ""Police Story 2"" are now together on one disc thanks to Shout! Factory. Being a huge Jackie Chan fan, these were two films that were already well established in this household. However, Shout! Factory did such a superb job with the last Jackie Chan Double Feature that bundled ""Crime Story"" and ""The Protector"" together that this suddenly became a necessity.After revisiting ""Police Story,"" there definitely doesn't seem to be much of any new material in the cut of the feature film. However, there are quite a few bonus features that may whet your appetite. There are a little over two minutes of Deleted Scenes that are mostly just an extra few frames here and there, an Alternate Ending that is mostly an extra 30-45 seconds compared to the original ending with some outtakes attached, an Extended Opening that revolves around Chan Ka Kui arriving to the police station from training and Kim's birthday, and the US and Hong Kong trailers. ""Police Story 2"" is much lighter on special features with two minutes of Outtakes, an International Trailer, the Original Hong Kong Trailer, and three minutes of Alternate Outtakes.You're probably wondering about how the film looks. In comparison to the DVDs, ""Police Story"" is a noticeable improvement and yet isn't quite as high-definition as you might expect. The picture is certainly brighter and clearer, but still looks slightly grainy and saturated. Yet it's still the best this film has ever looked. The sound is superb though. Even without surround sound, you can hear the score of the film clear across the room. ""Police Story 2"" is the same cut as the DVD as well, but the restoration is much more noticeable since the picture is so crisp and clear and the sound is just as impressive as it is in ""Police Story"" on this disc.""Police Story"" itself is one of Jackie Chan's best. The pole slide sequence at the very end is what always makes highlight reels, but the entire mall fight is really impressive. There's a good chunk in the middle of ""Police Story"" that is overly goofy with lame innuendos, misunderstandings, getting caught in lies, and May jumping to conclusions by usually getting upset for all the wrong reasons. The last 30 minutes or so are outstanding as is the opening squatter hut sequence and the parking lot fight. ""Police Story 2"" is a bit more serious and much more explosive. There are three of the greatest explosions put to film in ""Police Story 2."" The cafe fight, scuffle in the park, and battle at the fireworks factory should make this sequel worth adding to your collection if it hasn't been added to it already.Both films are available in English 5.1, Cantonese 5.1, and Cantonese Mono DTS-HD Master Audio sound. You typically have the option of multi-channel or two-channel sound in each language (two settings for each language, so four total). The only subtitles that are available are in English. The films are also presented in widescreen with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.There isn't much of anything new to this combo pack of ""Police Story"" and ""Police Story 2,"" but the fairly affordable price, getting two of Jackie Chan's most entertaining films on one disc, and being able to own both these films in high-definition should at least make you consider double dipping for this great collection.",5,Bundles two of Jackie Chan's best,1366070400,"04 16, 2013",2013,3357,"['Continuing', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Double', 'Feature', 'collection', 'Police', 'Story', 'Police', 'Story', '2', 'are', 'now', 'together', 'one', 'disc', 'thanks', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'Being', 'huge', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'fan', 'were', 'two', 'films', 'were', 'already', 'well', 'established', 'household', 'However', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'last', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Double', 'Feature', 'bundled', 'Crime', 'Story', 'Protector', 'together', 'suddenly', 'became', 'necessity.After', 'revisiting', 'Police', 'Story', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'new', 'material', 'cut', 'feature', 'film', 'However', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'bonus', 'features', 'may', 'whet', 'appetite', 'are', 'little', 'two', 'minutes', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'are', 'mostly', 'just', 'extra', 'few', 'frames', 'here', 'there', 'Alternate', 'Ending', 'mostly', 'extra', '30-45', 'seconds', 'compared', 'original', 'ending', 'outtakes', 'attached', 'Extended', 'Opening', 'Chan', 'Ka', 'Kui', 'arriving', 'police', 'station', 'training', 'Kim', 'birthday', 'US', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'trailers', 'Police', 'Story', '2', 'much', 'lighter', 'special', 'features', 'two', 'minutes', 'Outtakes', 'International', 'Trailer', 'Original', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Trailer', 'three', 'minutes', 'Alternate', 'Outtakes.You', ""'re"", 'probably', 'wondering', 'how', 'film', 'comparison', 'DVDs', 'Police', 'Story', 'noticeable', 'improvement', 'yet', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'high-definition', 'might', 'expect', 'picture', 'certainly', 'brighter', 'clearer', 'still', 'slightly', 'grainy', 'saturated', 'still', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'looked', 'sound', 'superb', 'Even', 'surround', 'sound', 'can', 'hear', 'score', 'film', 'clear', 'room', 'Police', 'Story', '2', 'same', 'cut', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'restoration', 'much', 'more', 'noticeable', 'picture', 'so', 'crisp', 'clear', 'sound', 'just', 'as', 'impressive', 'Police', 'Story', 'disc', 'Police', 'Story', 'one', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'best', 'pole', 'slide', 'sequence', 'very', 'end', 'what', 'always', 'highlight', 'reels', 'entire', 'mall', 'fight', 'really', 'impressive', 'good', 'chunk', 'middle', 'Police', 'Story', 'overly', 'goofy', 'lame', 'innuendos', 'misunderstandings', 'getting', 'caught', 'lies', 'May', 'jumping', 'conclusions', 'usually', 'getting', 'upset', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'are', 'outstanding', 'opening', 'squatter', 'hut', 'sequence', 'parking', 'lot', 'fight', 'Police', 'Story', '2', 'bit', 'more', 'serious', 'much', 'more', 'explosive', 'are', 'three', 'greatest', 'explosions', 'put', 'film', 'Police', 'Story', '2', 'cafe', 'fight', 'scuffle', 'park', 'battle', 'fireworks', 'factory', 'should', 'make', 'sequel', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection', ""n't"", 'been', 'added', 'films', 'are', 'available', 'English', '5.1', 'Cantonese', '5.1', 'Cantonese', 'Mono', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', 'sound', 'typically', 'have', 'option', 'multi-channel', 'two-channel', 'sound', 'language', 'two', 'settings', 'language', 'so', 'four', 'total', 'only', 'subtitles', 'are', 'available', 'are', 'English', 'films', 'are', 'also', 'presented', 'widescreen', '2.35:1', 'aspect', 'ratio.There', ""n't"", 'much', 'anything', 'new', 'combo', 'pack', 'Police', 'Story', 'Police', 'Story', '2', 'fairly', 'affordable', 'price', 'getting', 'two', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'most', 'entertaining', 'films', 'one', 'disc', 'being', 'able', 'own', 'films', 'high-definition', 'should', 'least', 'make', 'consider', 'double', 'dipping', 'great', 'collection']",Jackie Chan: Police Story / Police Story II

1618007,A2IYTNAMLR5TJR,B00AWHDEIQ,Don McGregor,"[2, 2]","Don McGregorApril 8, 2013RIDING SHOTGUNOver the years I have met various film directors who claim they'd studied the film-making of Buster Keaton and had been influenced by Keaton's 1920s cinema-language defining work and mind-warping, eye-boggling stunts.Keaton's superb timing and physical form leapt from the screen as if he defied gravity and mortal injury, with grace to spare.Jackie Chan has been quoted that Buster Keaton was a major influence to him in many of his films.SHOUT Factory has just released two of Jackie's Police Story movies on one Blu-Ray!In Police Story, alone, if you are familiar with Keaton's work, you can see that in Jackie's case he wasn't just talking words.I can find moments in Police Story and Police Story 2 where Jackie displays not only his incredible, balletic actions, but shows the influence of not just Buster Keaton, but also Douglas Fairbanks and Harold Lloyd's films from the 1920s.To take nothing away from Lloyd, because he did do many of his own stunts, with fingers missing from one hand, blown off by a prop for a still photo shoot, but Harvey Parry did double Harold in the more dangerous stunts.Jackie and Buster and Fairbanks did their own stunts.And Fairbank's modus operandi was to make the most difficult stunt look easy.You will see Jackie Chan do this again and again in Police Story 1 and 2.This is the first time either of the Police Story films have been released on Blu Ray, a double-feature from Jackie's prime as a director and star.  Shout has released them on DVD, also.  You can't beat the price, even the Blu-Ray can be found for less than $20.00.  The prints are the best I personally have ever seen, and although I am far from an expert on the films, they certainly appear to be uncut.  It's hard to tell with many of Jackie's films because there have been so many versions of different lengths released over the years.If you don't have any Jackie Chan on DVD, then this is an inexpensive way to own two of Jackie's most popular movies during the 1980s.Police Story opens with one of Jackie's biggest-scale openings ever, a drug raid taking place in a hillside Shanty Town, with tiers of buildings scattered haphazardly down the long, steep mountainside.  When the raid goes terribly awry within the first 5 minutes, Jackie is immediately in action.  The chase for the drug-lord and his cohorts smashes by cars down the mountain-side, through the ramshackle buildings and bright red and yellow clotheslines and paraphernalia from store goods to furniture.You can read the complete review at Comics Bulletin in my Riding Shotgun column, with photos.",5,"JACKIE CHAN CHANNELS BUSTER KEATON, DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS AND HAROLD LLOYD",1366070400,"04 16, 2013",2013,2617,"['Don', 'McGregorApril', '8', '2013RIDING', 'SHOTGUNOver', 'years', 'have', 'met', 'various', 'film', 'directors', 'who', 'claim', ""'d"", 'studied', 'film-making', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'had', 'been', 'influenced', 'Keaton', '1920s', 'cinema-language', 'defining', 'work', 'mind-warping', 'eye-boggling', 'stunts.Keaton', 'superb', 'timing', 'physical', 'form', 'leapt', 'screen', 'defied', 'gravity', 'mortal', 'injury', 'grace', 'spare.Jackie', 'Chan', 'been', 'quoted', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'was', 'major', 'influence', 'many', 'films.SHOUT', 'Factory', 'just', 'released', 'two', 'Jackie', 'Police', 'Story', 'movies', 'one', 'Blu-Ray', 'Police', 'Story', 'alone', 'are', 'familiar', 'Keaton', 'work', 'can', 'see', 'Jackie', 'case', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'talking', 'words.I', 'can', 'find', 'moments', 'Police', 'Story', 'Police', 'Story', '2', 'where', 'Jackie', 'not', 'only', 'incredible', 'balletic', 'actions', 'influence', 'not', 'just', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'also', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'films', '1920s.To', 'take', 'nothing', 'away', 'Lloyd', 'did', 'do', 'many', 'own', 'stunts', 'fingers', 'missing', 'one', 'hand', 'blown', 'off', 'prop', 'still', 'photo', 'shoot', 'Harvey', 'Parry', 'did', 'double', 'Harold', 'more', 'dangerous', 'stunts.Jackie', 'Buster', 'Fairbanks', 'did', 'own', 'stunts.And', 'Fairbank', 'modus', 'operandi', 'was', 'make', 'most', 'difficult', 'stunt', 'look', 'easy.You', 'will', 'see', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'do', 'again', 'again', 'Police', 'Story', '1', '2.This', 'first', 'time', 'Police', 'Story', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'double-feature', 'Jackie', 'prime', 'director', 'star', 'Shout', 'released', 'DVD', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'price', 'even', 'Blu-Ray', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'less', '20.00', 'prints', 'are', 'best', 'personally', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'am', 'far', 'expert', 'films', 'certainly', 'appear', 'be', 'uncut', 'hard', 'tell', 'many', 'Jackie', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'versions', 'different', 'lengths', 'released', 'years.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'DVD', 'then', 'inexpensive', 'way', 'own', 'two', 'Jackie', 'most', 'popular', 'movies', '1980s.Police', 'Story', 'opens', 'one', 'Jackie', 'biggest-scale', 'openings', 'ever', 'drug', 'raid', 'taking', 'place', 'hillside', 'Shanty', 'Town', 'tiers', 'buildings', 'scattered', 'haphazardly', 'long', 'steep', 'mountainside', 'When', 'raid', 'terribly', 'awry', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'Jackie', 'immediately', 'action', 'chase', 'drug-lord', 'cohorts', 'smashes', 'cars', 'down', 'mountain-side', 'ramshackle', 'buildings', 'bright', 'red', 'yellow', 'clotheslines', 'paraphernalia', 'store', 'goods', 'furniture.You', 'can', 'read', 'complete', 'review', 'Comics', 'Bulletin', 'Riding', 'Shotgun', 'column', 'photos']",Jackie Chan: Police Story / Police Story II
