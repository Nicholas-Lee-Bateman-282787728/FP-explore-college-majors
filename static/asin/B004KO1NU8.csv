1412376,A3D3AYY2YTWEVB,B004KO1NU8,Mickey Thorne,"[3, 3]","Great DVD. Wow. David can seem a bit distant, but I always attributed it to his genius. Seeing him on this DVD actually talking quite a bit helps one realize that he is quite human, and something I never doubted, loves those kids and that very sweet girl he married. Just from what I have heard, she is amazing. I admire her for the way she has supported David, allowing us to have so much of him.Even though I have never met David, I was drawn to him the first time I ever saw him on DVD. I remarked, ""Who is that guy with the kind of frumpy sweater."" My friend replied, ""You don't like his sweater?""  I explained that I liked it fine; it looked very comfortable, but who is he?  She did not know, even though she had many Gaither CDs and DVDs. I swear, I saw several before I ever heard David sing enough to really know he sings. I kept saying, ""Find out who he is."" She says, ""Why are you so interested?""  I told her, ""He is just full of things he wants to share, I can tell.""One night she played ""Heaven.""  I thought, ""Oh, brother.""  Then toward the very end, David sang. She said there's your guy, and I listened. I moved to the edge of the couch. ""Well, it's about time they let him sing,"" I said, and that was the last thing I said until he finished ""No More Night.""I came home and found it on his web page, then I listened to ""The End of the Beginning,"" and a couple of other songs. My search began: With some help from David's kind wife, I ordered God Bless America.""  Once I figured out how to order on the Internet, I bought the DVD called ""Heaven,"" so I could hear David, and learned to like the rest of it. I bought any DVD on which I could find David.My good friend's son had recently committed suicide. I introduced her to David on the Internet and she bought the CD Revelation. I cannot even remember how many times I went to her home with Gaither DVDs to play for her and her mother.  We found them healing. I found ""It is Well with my Soul."" on one of the Billy Graham DVDs that Gaither did. I got to know Bill Gaither, Guy Penrod, and Mark Lowry, and began to like some of the singers I thought I did not like, and continued to collect songs by David.This guy opened my world to music I would have never had in my home, were it not for him. I have lost at least a half dozen Gaither DVDs with folks not returning them, but so be it. I have quite a few. This makes me qualified to give a fairly reliable opinion about Bill and Gloria's efforts, and I can tell you one and all, this is a fantastic DVD. David sings O' Holy Night on this one. No one, not even Pavoroti or his mentor Mario Lanza sing it better, (actually not as well -in my opinion). David lives in his songs, and they are very moving.Bill and David are entertaining here; David is very down to earth, and seeing him with his kids is a treat. Seeing him with his wife revealed to me why he is doing so well. What a little soldier she is.Bill has truly given us some of David's very best on this DVD. Toward the end of it David seems to be getting tired, but is still gracious. I have no doubt that Bill Gaither fully appreciates this young man and the talent that he has contributed throughout the years. It thrilled my heart to hear Bill being so sweet. (Guess I'm a softy.)Of course, Bill is always nice, but this is special.  I think you will really miss something if you do not get this publication. It is very generous, so you will have more than your money's worth.Mickey Thorne",5,Getting to know David just a little bit better!,1319328000,"10 23, 2011",2011,3466,"['Great', 'DVD', 'Wow', 'David', 'can', 'seem', 'bit', 'distant', 'always', 'attributed', 'genius', 'Seeing', 'DVD', 'actually', 'talking', 'quite', 'bit', 'one', 'realize', 'quite', 'human', 'something', 'never', 'doubted', 'loves', 'kids', 'very', 'sweet', 'girl', 'married', 'Just', 'what', 'have', 'heard', 'amazing', 'admire', 'way', 'supported', 'David', 'allowing', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'him.Even', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'David', 'was', 'drawn', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'saw', 'DVD', 'remarked', 'Who', 'guy', 'kind', 'frumpy', 'sweater', 'friend', 'replied', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'sweater', 'explained', 'liked', 'looked', 'very', 'comfortable', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'even', 'had', 'many', 'Gaither', 'CDs', 'DVDs', 'swear', 'saw', 'several', 'ever', 'heard', 'David', 'sing', 'enough', 'really', 'know', 'kept', 'saying', 'Find', 'out', 'who', 'Why', 'are', 'so', 'interested', 'told', 'just', 'full', 'things', 'share', 'can', 'tell', 'One', 'night', 'played', 'Heaven', 'thought', 'Oh', 'brother', 'Then', 'very', 'end', 'David', 'sang', 'said', 'guy', 'listened', 'moved', 'edge', 'couch', 'Well', 'time', 'let', 'sing', 'said', 'was', 'last', 'thing', 'said', 'finished', 'No', 'More', 'Night', 'came', 'home', 'found', 'web', 'page', 'then', 'listened', 'End', 'Beginning', 'couple', 'other', 'songs', 'search', 'began', 'help', 'David', 'kind', 'wife', 'ordered', 'God', 'Bless', 'America', 'Once', 'figured', 'out', 'how', 'order', 'Internet', 'bought', 'DVD', 'called', 'Heaven', 'could', 'hear', 'David', 'learned', 'rest', 'bought', 'DVD', 'could', 'find', 'David.My', 'good', 'friend', 'son', 'had', 'recently', 'committed', 'suicide', 'introduced', 'David', 'Internet', 'bought', 'CD', 'Revelation', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'remember', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'went', 'home', 'Gaither', 'DVDs', 'play', 'mother', 'found', 'healing', 'found', 'Well', 'Soul', 'one', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'DVDs', 'Gaither', 'did', 'got', 'know', 'Bill', 'Gaither', 'Guy', 'Penrod', 'Mark', 'Lowry', 'began', 'like', 'singers', 'thought', 'did', 'not', 'continued', 'collect', 'songs', 'David.This', 'guy', 'opened', 'world', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'home', 'were', 'not', 'have', 'lost', 'least', 'half', 'dozen', 'Gaither', 'DVDs', 'folks', 'not', 'returning', 'so', 'be', 'have', 'quite', 'few', 'qualified', 'give', 'fairly', 'reliable', 'opinion', 'Bill', 'Gloria', 'efforts', 'can', 'tell', 'one', 'fantastic', 'DVD', 'David', 'O', 'Holy', 'Night', 'one', 'one', 'not', 'even', 'Pavoroti', 'mentor', 'Mario', 'Lanza', 'sing', 'better', 'actually', 'not', 'well', 'opinion', 'David', 'songs', 'are', 'very', 'moving.Bill', 'David', 'are', 'entertaining', 'here', 'David', 'very', 'down', 'earth', 'seeing', 'kids', 'treat', 'Seeing', 'wife', 'revealed', 'why', 'doing', 'so', 'well', 'What', 'little', 'soldier', 'is.Bill', 'truly', 'given', 'David', 'very', 'best', 'DVD', 'Toward', 'end', 'David', 'be', 'getting', 'tired', 'still', 'gracious', 'have', 'doubt', 'Bill', 'Gaither', 'fully', 'young', 'man', 'talent', 'contributed', 'years', 'thrilled', 'heart', 'hear', 'Bill', 'being', 'so', 'sweet', 'Guess', ""'m"", 'softy', 'course', 'Bill', 'always', 'nice', 'special', 'think', 'will', 'really', 'miss', 'something', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'publication', 'very', 'generous', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'money', 'worth.Mickey', 'Thorne']",The Best of David Phe
