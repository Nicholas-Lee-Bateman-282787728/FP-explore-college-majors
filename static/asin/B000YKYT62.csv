The great things about the group are quickly overshadowed but John's drug use and 3/4's of the group were moral reprobates. The Mamas and the Papas are a great case study of how wonderful talent and hope is quickly ruined by substance abuse and poor behavior. How many rock bios tell the same sad story?I have mixed emotions about this DVD. If you are a big fan you will want it but how many times can you view the last 45 minutes of it?,3,Just viewed,1261094400,"12 18, 2009",2009,529,"['one', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'music', 'personally', 'group', 'well', 'known', 'train', 'wreck', 'great', 'things', 'group', 'are', 'quickly', 'overshadowed', 'John', 'drug', 'use', '3/4', ""'s"", 'group', 'were', 'moral', 'reprobates', 'Mamas', 'Papas', 'are', 'great', 'case', 'study', 'how', 'wonderful', 'talent', 'hope', 'quickly', 'ruined', 'substance', 'abuse', 'poor', 'behavior', 'How', 'many', 'rock', 'bios', 'tell', 'same', 'sad', 'story', 'have', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'DVD', 'are', 'big', 'fan', 'will', 'want', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'view', 'last', '45', 'minutes']",Mamas & The Papas: Straight Shooter

Never on her father, who certainly never did anything wrong, cuz, you know, he was a genius...Straight Shooter purports to be about the group, but concentrates most on John Phillips. The entire DVD is worth it for the marvelous editing of the story about ending his marriage to take up with a 16 year old. We see his (now) ex-wife, growling about Michelle, ""She was ... brazen."" Just when I was thinking what a nasty, bitter old woman this was, the show cut to Michelle Phillips, cheerily saying, (paraphrasing) ""I saw HER and I knew it was only a matter of time before she was gone, and __I__ was at his side."" Then, just as cheerily, she describes cheating on John with Denny while she knew Cass was in love with Denny, and my jaw hit the floor.That's (to use the writer's cliche) not TELLING you about a person, but SHOWING you. Brilliant.The backstory of the group is good, but if you are a fan you already know most of the facts presented. Get this DVD for the interviews.",4,Icky.

1120241,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000YKYT62,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[0, 0]","(4.5 stars)The Mamas & The Papas: Straight Shooter is a very good documentary of The Mamas & The Papas and their history; but I must agree with another reviewer who notes that a lot of time is spent on John Phillips and the minute details of his drug taking days while not enough time is spent on Cass Elliott, Michelle Phillips and Denny Doherty after the group disbanded. Indeed, the focus on John Phillips is quite something when you consider we even get footage of several of his family members which is something we don't get for the other members of the group. On the other hand, the three bonus features do a good job of filling in many of the blanks that were left in the film; and that's what leads me to give this four and one-half stars. In addition, the documentary moves along at a very good pace; I was never bored.All in all, there's very little significant history about the group that you'll need to know after you read the lengthy editorial review Amazon posted halfway down this product page. However, there are some extra stories well worth telling that flesh out the story of this group; and I'm not going to spoil much for you by telling you all of them here. There are things like the tale of how they initially met Cass Elliott, how Cass was able to suddenly sing higher notes than ever before, Cass contributing to the group and her career after she left the group. In addition, the archival footage is really special; you've got to see it to truly appreciate the value of this film. The footage of the revived Mamas & The Papas at the end of the film is very well done as well. I also liked the footage of The Monterey Pop Festival during the ""summer of love;"" and I learned a lot about how John Phillips did so much to make that happen.As for those bonus features: Chronicles has Michelle Phillips tells us her memories of Cass Elliott and Cass' history with The Mugwumps and The Big 3. Michelle also talks about how the group shot to stardom and more; parts of this come from the main portion of the documentary but a lot does come as true-blue extra info. Denny Doherty recalls how he met John Phillips and began to work with him as part of another bonus feature; and the third bonus includes commentary from documentary filmmaker D.A. Pennebaker who made a terrific film about The Monterey Pop Festival.It may seem as if everything has been given away and that there's nothing new to find if you watch this film, especially with the editorial review above. However, I can't tell you in words about the experience you have when you watch this film. The nostalgic effect is terrific; both the interview footage and the archival footage impress me greatly. This is a great film for folk rock fans, people who like classic rock from the mid 1960s and, of course, people who want to learn about The Mamas & The Papas as well as their fans.",5,one heck of a story,1251417600,"08 28, 2009",2009,2864,"['4.5', 'stars', 'Mamas', 'Papas', 'Straight', 'Shooter', 'very', 'good', 'documentary', 'Mamas', 'Papas', 'history', 'must', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'lot', 'time', 'spent', 'John', 'Phillips', 'minute', 'details', 'drug', 'taking', 'days', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'spent', 'Cass', 'Elliott', 'Michelle', 'Phillips', 'Denny', 'Doherty', 'group', 'disbanded', 'Indeed', 'focus', 'John', 'Phillips', 'quite', 'something', 'when', 'consider', 'even', 'get', 'footage', 'several', 'family', 'members', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'other', 'members', 'group', 'other', 'hand', 'three', 'bonus', 'features', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'filling', 'many', 'blanks', 'were', 'left', 'film', 'what', 'give', 'four', 'one-half', 'stars', 'addition', 'documentary', 'moves', 'along', 'very', 'good', 'pace', 'was', 'never', 'bored.All', 'very', 'little', 'significant', 'history', 'group', ""'ll"", 'need', 'know', 'read', 'lengthy', 'editorial', 'review', 'Amazon', 'posted', 'halfway', 'down', 'product', 'page', 'However', 'are', 'extra', 'stories', 'well', 'telling', 'out', 'story', 'group', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'spoil', 'much', 'telling', 'here', 'are', 'things', 'tale', 'how', 'initially', 'met', 'Cass', 'Elliott', 'how', 'Cass', 'was', 'able', 'suddenly', 'sing', 'higher', 'notes', 'ever', 'Cass', 'contributing', 'group', 'career', 'left', 'group', 'addition', 'archival', 'footage', 'really', 'special', ""'ve"", 'got', 'see', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'value', 'film', 'footage', 'revived', 'Mamas', 'Papas', 'end', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'liked', 'footage', 'Monterey', 'Pop', 'Festival', 'summer', 'love', 'learned', 'lot', 'how', 'John', 'Phillips', 'did', 'so', 'much', 'make', 'happen.As', 'bonus', 'features', 'Chronicles', 'Michelle', 'Phillips', 'memories', 'Cass', 'Elliott', 'Cass', 'history', 'Mugwumps', 'Big', '3', 'Michelle', 'also', 'how', 'group', 'shot', 'stardom', 'more', 'parts', 'come', 'main', 'portion', 'documentary', 'lot', 'come', 'true-blue', 'extra', 'info', 'Denny', 'Doherty', 'how', 'met', 'John', 'Phillips', 'began', 'work', 'part', 'bonus', 'feature', 'third', 'bonus', 'commentary', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'D.A', 'Pennebaker', 'who', 'made', 'terrific', 'film', 'Monterey', 'Pop', 'Festival.It', 'may', 'seem', 'everything', 'been', 'given', 'away', 'nothing', 'new', 'find', 'watch', 'film', 'especially', 'editorial', 'review', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'words', 'experience', 'have', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'nostalgic', 'effect', 'terrific', 'interview', 'footage', 'archival', 'footage', 'impress', 'greatly', 'great', 'film', 'folk', 'rock', 'fans', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'classic', 'rock', 'mid', '1960s', 'course', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'learn', 'Mamas', 'Papas', 'as', 'well', 'fans']",Mamas & The Papas: Straight Shooter
