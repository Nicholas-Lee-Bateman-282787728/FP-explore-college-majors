1381850,ADFLPF6FI3W0O,B0041KT3OE,ASP,"[2, 3]","This collection is a mediocre grouping of shorts from different seasons.  I expected these shorts to be a lot funnier, similar to The Office tv epsiodes, but these shorts are lacking.  Some moments are funny and entertaining, but it feels like the unfunny moments last longer than the funny moments.  Also, the flow of the episodes could have been better if they had removed the intro bumpers between each 2 minute clip.  The intros add about 10 seconds each and feel unnecessary.Another review already listed everything that is on the DVD, so I won't list the contents.  I enjoyed Creed's Blackmail short and thought it finally gave his mysterious character more screen time.  Kelly and Erin's video was slightly entertaining.  ""The Accountants"" is not funny, and ""The Loan"" is not funny, except for Darryl's appearance.Characters in the shorts: Oscar, Angela, Kevin, Creed, Kelly, Ryan, Andy, Erin, Gabe, Toby.  However, Michael Scott, Jim, and Pam are not in any of the shorts.  Dwight Schrute makes an appearance for 2 minutes and his appearance is funny.  I don't think this collection is worth the fifteen or ten.  Only die-hard fans on The Office should get this, but everyone else should just watch the shorts online.  I expected the shorts to be a lot funnier.",3,I expected this collection to be funnier.,1291248000,"12 2, 2010",2010,1269,"['collection', 'mediocre', 'grouping', 'shorts', 'different', 'seasons', 'expected', 'shorts', 'be', 'lot', 'funnier', 'similar', 'Office', 'tv', 'epsiodes', 'shorts', 'are', 'lacking', 'moments', 'are', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'unfunny', 'moments', 'last', 'longer', 'funny', 'moments', 'Also', 'flow', 'episodes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'removed', 'intro', 'bumpers', '2', 'minute', 'clip', 'intros', 'add', '10', 'seconds', 'feel', 'unnecessary.Another', 'review', 'already', 'listed', 'everything', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'list', 'contents', 'enjoyed', 'Creed', 'Blackmail', 'short', 'thought', 'finally', 'gave', 'mysterious', 'character', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Kelly', 'Erin', 'video', 'was', 'slightly', 'entertaining', 'Accountants', 'not', 'funny', 'Loan', 'not', 'funny', 'Darryl', 'appearance.Characters', 'shorts', 'Oscar', 'Angela', 'Kevin', 'Creed', 'Kelly', 'Ryan', 'Andy', 'Erin', 'Gabe', 'Toby', 'However', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'are', 'not', 'shorts', 'Dwight', 'Schrute', 'appearance', '2', 'minutes', 'appearance', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'collection', 'fifteen', 'ten', 'Only', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'Office', 'should', 'get', 'everyone', 'else', 'should', 'just', 'watch', 'shorts', 'online', 'expected', 'shorts', 'be', 'lot', 'funnier']",The Office: Digital Shorts Collection

1381853,A30JVMVY6KL3EK,B0041KT3OE,Robert D. Watson,"[134, 143]","So here we have a new ""The Office"" product, and I got it, not really knowing what to expect.  There surely isn't a whole lot of information out there as to what this exactly is supposed to be.  I look at it like a bridge between the Michael Scott era, and the upcoming non-Michael Scott era version of the show (he barely appears in any of the shorts, maybe this is to flesh out some of the minor characters who will become more important next season?).  It's a bunch of 7 minute long excerpts that look like ideas the producers had that just never made it into the show because there wasn't enough to make a whole episode on.The problem with this disc is simple - you have a good 90% of this content already if you own the season DVDs.  There are a few things on here that I didn't recognize as having seen already, but for the most part, almost the entire content of this disc, special features included, can already be found by hunting through Seasons 3-6 in the bonus content area.  I'm going to assume that I either forgot about the rest, or they'll be some of the bonus features on Season 7.Is it good material?  Yeah, it's pretty watchable, and having it all in one place is great, but like I said, this is kind of like buying a greatest hits album of a band who's entire discography you already have, so the value of it is questionable.  None of these shorts are as good as your average Office episode, but they're funny nonetheless.  Video quality, etc is not much different than the originals I saw on the seasons.I'd skip it if I were you, if only because you should spend your money on the seasons instead, if you don't already have them.",2,"It's all in one place, but how much is that worth to you?",1290297600,"11 21, 2010",2010,1650,"['So', 'here', 'have', 'new', 'Office', 'product', 'got', 'not', 'really', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', 'surely', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'information', 'out', 'there', 'what', 'exactly', 'supposed', 'be', 'look', 'bridge', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'era', 'upcoming', 'non-Michael', 'Scott', 'era', 'version', 'show', 'barely', 'shorts', 'maybe', 'flesh', 'out', 'minor', 'characters', 'who', 'will', 'become', 'more', 'important', 'next', 'season', 'bunch', '7', 'minute', 'long', 'excerpts', 'look', 'ideas', 'producers', 'had', 'just', 'never', 'made', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'whole', 'episode', 'on.The', 'problem', 'disc', 'simple', 'have', 'good', '90', '%', 'content', 'already', 'own', 'season', 'DVDs', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'having', 'seen', 'already', 'most', 'part', 'almost', 'entire', 'content', 'disc', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'can', 'already', 'be', 'found', 'hunting', 'Seasons', '3-6', 'bonus', 'content', 'area', ""'m"", 'going', 'assume', 'forgot', 'rest', ""'ll"", 'be', 'bonus', 'features', 'Season', '7.Is', 'good', 'material', 'Yeah', 'pretty', 'watchable', 'having', 'one', 'place', 'great', 'said', 'kind', 'buying', 'greatest', 'hits', 'album', 'band', 'who', 'entire', 'discography', 'already', 'have', 'value', 'questionable', 'None', 'shorts', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'average', 'Office', 'episode', ""'re"", 'funny', 'nonetheless', 'Video', 'quality', 'etc', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'originals', 'saw', 'seasons.I', ""'d"", 'skip', 'were', 'only', 'should', 'spend', 'money', 'seasons', 'instead', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'have']",The Office: Digital Shorts Collection
