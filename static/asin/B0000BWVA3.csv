770964,A2HUKDYPATWREE,B0000BWVA3,Albert E.,"[1, 1]","Teaching babies the numbers 1-5 is great and all, but I am beyond perplexed why in the world Baby Einstein stopped at the number 5.  Do they really think that babies can't learn more than that?  Good grief!  They are just getting started there!  This DVD is very entertaining.  Indeed,it is mostly entertainment as the numbers one through five will be mastered in very short order there by making it pure entertainment.  Save your money and buy Richard Scary's Best Counting Video Ever.  It is just as entertaining (if not more so) and goes to number 20, with lots of cute dialogue that babies love.  Similarly, check out Leap Frog Letter Factory (for letters) and Trebellina (for music).

I think this is among the best of the Baby Einstein collection, but thats not saying much. I did notice that this one (unlike many others) was actually designed with the help of a developmental psychologist. Finally! As a result, it has a better structure, good pacing, and makes a better attempt at concept reinforcement than the other BE products. As is unfortunately typical among Baby Einstein, they make mistakes that interfere with the concept development, or add content that is only minimally related to what they are supposedly trying to teach. Buy BE because it has pretty music and pictures, but don't be fooled by BE marketing that your child will learn from them. I do think this one is entertaining but would not get it for a child over 12 months.If you're purchasing something educational for your child, stick with Sesame Street DVDs.

770977,A1GOJL8ZS95UKO,B0000BWVA3,Mom Of Many Munchkins,"[11, 12]","Unlike most of the Baby Eistein videos that show toys, puppets, spinning things, etc for really no reason at all, this video at least has a purpose for showing all of those kinds of things.  For the number 1, they start with a puppet scene and a little poem.  Julie Clark is the narrator and if you have read any of my other Baby Einstein reviews, you'll know I do not care her voice at all (sorry Julie!).  But, if you can get past that, then it's a pretty good dvd.After this little puppet scene they show 1 apple, 1 duck, 1 cup and then they show all kinds of things for the number one (a toy, a flower, an animal, etc).  There is lots of live-action video here.  One little thing that bugs me is that the number 1 should just be a straight line, not with the little thing at the top which makes it look similar to a 7.  I mean, these videos are for our little children and we should teach them how to properly write their numbers.Each number, from 1 to 5, has about 5 minutes of video for it.  For the number 2 they will have a puppet scene again with a poem, then show 2 apples, 2 ducks and 2 cups (these 3 items are shown for each number) and then this is followed by things in two's.  There could be a little more speaking of the numbers when they show these things, I think.At first I thought I wasn't going to like this dvd because it only goes to the number 5.  But, my little girls is only 18 months and can't even really count to 2 yet, so I guess a video that goes up to 5 is a good place to start.  For beyond the number 5 you might want to check out Baby Brainy 123's (I have a review for that too).On the Main Menu for the dvd there are some really nice added features.  There are Discovery Cards (these say the numbers 1 - 10 in 7 different languages), there are Count-Along Activities, How Many?, and See & Spy Counting Book.  I don't know if the vhs video version would have these bonus features.  If they don't then the vhs is really lacking in some good added activities.Despite a few little negative things (Julie's voice, the number 1 looking like a 7, etc), which caused me to only give this 4 stars, I ended up purchasing this one for my daughter.  This one along with Baby Neptune (water), Baby Galileo (sky), and Baby Newton (shapes) are the only Baby Einstein videos that I personally like.
