Then the director said &quot; LET'S BLOW THINGS UP. FORGET PLOT, ACTING AND SUSPENSE. THE AUDIENCE IS TOO STUPID TO NOTICE THESE THINGS ANYWAY. JUST GIVE THEM EXPLOSIONS!&quot;Very sad. It could have been so much more, it looked to be so much more and then it just lost the plot. It was quite gripping until the explosions started. The ending is poor and lacks suspense, but it does have some big explosions. Maybe one day they will do some Thrillers with some real bite and edge to them.

The film had an interesting premise, that of a serial killer that stalks women in order to kill them, but first send photos of his intended victims to a cop that he has drawn into his web of murder.  Unfortunately there are plot holes in this film that I could drive a bread truck through.  For instance, Spader plays a LA cop that quits the force and moves to Chicago so that he can live in squalor, but before you know it, he's serving as a FBI agent hot on the trail of Reeves, over-playing the part of the serial killer.  It was refreshing to see Reeves in a role where he didn't play some sort of goof, but instead was the antagonist of the film, although he acted in his characteristic style.  While the storyline has been played before, the filmmakers decided to spice it up by adding a bit of history to the characters played by Spader and Reeves.  Marisa Tomei plays the psychologist that is helping Spader deal with his inner demons, and of course is eventually confronted by Reeves, and drawn further into the plot of this film.  The special effects are rather cheesy, and when things are set on fire, the flames look particularly cartoonish.  I've certainly seen all three of these actors in better films, but this one is at least worth a rent.",3,"Good Premise, But It's Been Done Before",983577600,"03 3, 2001",2001,1504,"['continuing', 'tradition', 'movies', 'James', 'Spader', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'turn', 'down', 'quot', 'Watcher', 'quot', 'served', 'yet', 'vehicle', 'Spader', 'perform', 'well', 'rest', 'cast', 'just', 'seemed', 'go', 'motions', 'acting', 'film', 'had', 'interesting', 'premise', 'serial', 'killer', 'women', 'order', 'kill', 'first', 'send', 'photos', 'intended', 'victims', 'cop', 'drawn', 'web', 'murder', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'film', 'could', 'drive', 'bread', 'truck', 'instance', 'Spader', 'LA', 'cop', 'force', 'moves', 'Chicago', 'so', 'can', 'live', 'squalor', 'know', 'serving', 'FBI', 'agent', 'hot', 'trail', 'Reeves', 'over-playing', 'part', 'serial', 'killer', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Reeves', 'role', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'sort', 'goof', 'instead', 'was', 'antagonist', 'film', 'acted', 'characteristic', 'style', 'storyline', 'been', 'played', 'filmmakers', 'decided', 'spice', 'up', 'adding', 'bit', 'history', 'characters', 'played', 'Spader', 'Reeves', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'psychologist', 'helping', 'Spader', 'deal', 'inner', 'demons', 'course', 'eventually', 'confronted', 'Reeves', 'drawn', 'further', 'plot', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'rather', 'cheesy', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'set', 'fire', 'flames', 'look', 'particularly', 'cartoonish', ""'ve"", 'certainly', 'seen', 'three', 'actors', 'better', 'films', 'one', 'least', 'rent']",The Watcher

The relationship between Keanu and Spader are natural and convincing. I like Keanu in the &quot;Bad Guy&quot; role; he puts his laid-back style into the role and totally sells it. I've read some reviews that knock his performance here, I obviously don't agree! His laid back style is a breath of fresh air from the &quot;off the wall, over energetic, borderline spastic&quot; killers that we usually see in this kind of role. In fact, Keanu's demeanor makes the character even that much more spooky! That being said, I do agree that James Spader is the shinning star here. Spader, as the &quot;burnt out&quot; Cop on the verge of a stroke, is painful to watch (in a good way), Spader makes you feel the pain and stress that his character feels. Marisa Tomei does an ample job at playing her role, the fact that the role she portrays isn't really a factor until the end of the movie, she does the job of keeping the character at the level it was meant to be at. Yes this movie has been done before, a few times in fact, but the combination of Spader and Reeves gives it a new face.  For my fellow Home Theater owners, this movie is fun to watch. There is great base and crisp highs; explosions will surely give your subs a workout! My only knock of this movie is the over use of (what is considered by today's standard) hip music. When the scene seems to call for suspenseful music, all of a sudden the rap/rock type of music starts (Stigmata had this same problem), but if you can look (or listen) past that, this is a great flick to watch and own.",4,"Keanu and Spader, Perfect together!",983923200,"03 7, 2001",2001,1688,"['are', 'two', 'reasons', 'why', 'should', 'buy', 'flick', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'James', 'Spader', 'awesome', 'sound', 'track', 'relationship', 'Keanu', 'Spader', 'are', 'natural', 'convincing', 'like', 'Keanu', 'quot', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'quot', 'role', 'laid-back', 'style', 'role', 'totally', ""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', 'knock', 'performance', 'here', 'obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'laid', 'back', 'style', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'quot', 'wall', 'energetic', 'borderline', 'spastic', 'quot', 'killers', 'usually', 'see', 'kind', 'role', 'fact', 'Keanu', 'demeanor', 'character', 'even', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'spooky', 'being', 'said', 'do', 'agree', 'James', 'Spader', 'shinning', 'star', 'here', 'Spader', 'quot', 'quot', 'Cop', 'verge', 'stroke', 'painful', 'watch', 'good', 'way', 'Spader', 'feel', 'pain', 'stress', 'character', 'feels', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'ample', 'job', 'playing', 'role', 'fact', 'role', ""n't"", 'really', 'factor', 'end', 'movie', 'job', 'keeping', 'character', 'level', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'Yes', 'movie', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'few', 'times', 'fact', 'combination', 'Spader', 'Reeves', 'new', 'face', 'fellow', 'Home', 'Theater', 'owners', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'great', 'base', 'crisp', 'highs', 'explosions', 'will', 'surely', 'give', 'subs', 'workout', 'only', 'knock', 'movie', 'use', 'what', 'considered', 'today', 'standard', 'hip', 'music', 'When', 'scene', 'call', 'suspenseful', 'music', 'sudden', 'rap/rock', 'type', 'music', 'starts', 'Stigmata', 'had', 'same', 'problem', 'can', 'look', 'listen', 'great', 'flick', 'watch', 'own']",The Watcher

You see, not only was she burned to death, but it was partly Campbell's fault, at least in his own mind. He had left her behind in order to chase after the serial-killer who had abducted her, uaware that a fire had broken out. If only he'd untied her before leaving! The memory of this haunts Campbell for years, causing him to relocate to Chicago and sedate himself w/ drugs. Now, Campbell is in therapy (in the care of Marisa Tomei!!!!) and making little progress. Of course, things get much worse when David Allen Griffin (Keanu Reeves), the serial-killing nutbag from LA starts to miss Campbell and decides to track him down. Once in Chicago, Griffin begins locating, stalking, and murdering young women. He contacts Campbell, challenging him to a game of save-the-girl-before-I-kill-her. Campbell must snap out of his depressive nose-dive and get to work before Griffin kills again. I liked this movie quite a bit. Spader is excellent in his role as the shattered human being who must rise from the ashes of his own life. Reeves makes a decent maniac, driven by his need for Campbell's interest.

The premise sounded intriguing enough; James Spader is a burned out  Los Angeles detective who had let serial killer Keanu Reeves slip through his fingers. Now, some time later and in Chicago, Spader begins to receive pictures of new potential victims that Keanu is &quot;watching&quot;. This sets off a cat and mouse game of, &quot;can Spader get to the girls in time before Keanu strangles them with piano wire&quot;? Oh, one more thing: Marissa Tomei has the thankless role of playing Spader's therapist, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out she's gonna be the ultimate victim. Here's the thing; I love a good thriller, &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, &quot;Copycat&quot;. This ain't one of them. It asks the viewer to leave all common sense at the door.

The real highlight of the film of course is the charismatic James Spader, looking fabulous as usual, playing a substance abusing former cop.  The premise of the film has been done before of course-serial killer becomes obsessed with the cop who wants to arrest him- but this movie is no &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; but rather rises above its tired premise to new heights of suspense.Reeves, not the greatest actor but surely as good as the overrated Ben Affleck, really gives a great and scary performance as the killer searching for connectionless young woman to prey on.The film is interesting because it examines a phenomenon common in America today-lack of communication. It is very possible to get lost in the crowd and be a ghost in your own life.The film was also deeply psychologically disturbing, and poses many questions.

Reeves latched onto Spader's character and made the game personal by killing someone Spader cared about. The movie begins with Spader now an ex-FBI agent who has moved to Chicago to get away from his past. He's a mess, barely sleeping and using prescription meds to live day to day. He soon gets pulled back into the field however when he discovers that Reeves has followed him to Chicago and has started their game up again by killing more women. He contacts Spader and tells him he will mail a picture of his next victim to him and then Spader will have 24 hours to find her before Reeves kills her. Marisa Tomei plays a therapist Spader has been seeing and Reeves eventually goes after her.On the box of this DVD Ebert and Roeper say this is ""a superb thriller"". They must have watched a different movie called The Watcher because this is not a good movie. The plot is clich&eacute; and overdone.

529763,A3KOVFORKXQ2U9,B00003CXND,Daniel McInnis,"[5, 6]","Though The Watcher may be a very fun popcorn flick, it's missing some key ingredients in the make-up of a good thriller.  The characters are flat, the acting is lame, the storyline is inconsistent and the plausibility, well there is none.  Yet having written all that I can't say that this movie is really that bad.  Afterall, it's hour and a half running time zips by faster than most forty minute episodes of CSI.Keanu Reeves, despite being burried in the credits, is the star of this film as serial killer David Allen Griffith.  He's a watcher (thus the title) who targets introverted young women and strangles them with a piano wire.  And as it turns out his greatest pleasure is not in perpetrating the act itself but in the torment he inflicts on the federal agent working his case.James Spader (as intense as ever) plays Joel Campbell, the L.A. lawman and object of this killers twisted obsession.  But when push comes to shove Joel cracks under the pressure and moves to Chicago to get away from the killings, only to discover months later that his past has caught up with him.David follows him to the Windy City and begins sending him pictures of his intended victims, daring him to try and find them before he strikes again.  By doing this he imposes onto Joel the pain of having had the opportunity to save these girls lives only to blame himself when he fails.  It's actually a pretty clever premise but is executed is such a way that the filmmakers seem more intent on going through the motions than having fun with the concept.As the story continues to unravel, we're introduced in passing to Joel's psychatrist, who because she's played by Marisa Tomei, we know will play a large part in the film's conclusion.  It's only too obvious and first time director Joe Charbanic seems intent on letting his audience get ahead of him.  That's the movie's biggest flaw, that it tips it's hat too soon and, conversely, can't manage to build suspense.  As we're engaged in a race-against-time car chase we already know what's going to happen because the killer can't very well be caught an hour into the picture.I suspect this is material that would have been better suited to a veteran director and some tweaking in the casting department.  Reeves' over-the-top performance is at times chilling but mostly ridiculous.  He seems to shy away from the underlying homosexual themes of his character's relationship with Spader's.  That wouldn't have been a bad thing necessarily except that was his only interesting characteristic.Marisa Tomei on the other hand, is subdued in her performance,  a role seemingly custom-made for Lorraine Bracco to reprise her role on The Sopranos.  It's obviously been too long since My Cousin Vinney, for which she won the Oscar for (and deserved it too).  I only hope she has more discretion when it comes to choosing future projects.And she's not even the only actor to have their talents put to waste.  Ernie Hudson is reduced to a bit part here, and even when he does manage to elbow his way onto the screen for some face time, it's usually just to clench his jowl and look angry.  Chris Ellis is another one, an actor good enough to go unnoticed in box office hits like Armageddom and Godzilla, but this time is saddled with lines of dialogue so bad he's practically got a bullseye painted on his back.I can't help but admit I found this movie at least mildly entertaining.  Still, for all it's good qualities there are a half dozen bad ones and I can't in good conscious recommend it when such contemporary classics as Manhunter and Vampires Kiss have gone widely unwatched.All in all, it's a decent movie that may be worth your time but definately is not worth your nine dollars.",2,Not  Very  Good  But  Quite  Watchable,982972800,"02 24, 2001",2001,3720,"['Watcher', 'may', 'be', 'very', 'fun', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'missing', 'key', 'ingredients', 'make-up', 'good', 'thriller', 'characters', 'are', 'flat', 'acting', 'lame', 'storyline', 'inconsistent', 'plausibility', 'well', 'none', 'having', 'written', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'movie', 'really', 'bad', 'Afterall', 'hour', 'half', 'running', 'time', 'zips', 'faster', 'most', 'forty', 'minute', 'episodes', 'CSI.Keanu', 'Reeves', 'being', 'burried', 'credits', 'star', 'film', 'serial', 'killer', 'David', 'Allen', 'Griffith', 'watcher', 'thus', 'title', 'who', 'introverted', 'young', 'women', 'piano', 'wire', 'out', 'greatest', 'pleasure', 'not', 'perpetrating', 'act', 'torment', 'federal', 'agent', 'working', 'case.James', 'Spader', 'as', 'intense', 'ever', 'Joel', 'Campbell', 'L.A.', 'lawman', 'object', 'killers', 'twisted', 'obsession', 'when', 'push', 'shove', 'Joel', 'cracks', 'pressure', 'moves', 'Chicago', 'get', 'away', 'killings', 'only', 'discover', 'months', 'later', 'past', 'caught', 'up', 'him.David', 'Windy', 'City', 'sending', 'pictures', 'intended', 'victims', 'daring', 'try', 'find', 'again', 'doing', 'Joel', 'pain', 'having', 'had', 'opportunity', 'save', 'girls', 'only', 'blame', 'when', 'actually', 'pretty', 'clever', 'premise', 'executed', 'such', 'way', 'filmmakers', 'seem', 'more', 'intent', 'going', 'motions', 'having', 'fun', 'concept.As', 'story', 'unravel', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'passing', 'Joel', 'psychatrist', 'who', 'played', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'know', 'will', 'play', 'large', 'part', 'film', 'conclusion', 'only', 'too', 'obvious', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Joe', 'Charbanic', 'intent', 'letting', 'audience', 'get', 'ahead', 'movie', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'hat', 'too', 'soon', 'conversely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'manage', 'build', 'suspense', ""'re"", 'engaged', 'race-against-time', 'car', 'chase', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'killer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'be', 'caught', 'hour', 'picture.I', 'suspect', 'material', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'suited', 'veteran', 'director', 'tweaking', 'casting', 'department', 'Reeves', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'times', 'chilling', 'mostly', 'ridiculous', 'shy', 'away', 'underlying', 'homosexual', 'themes', 'character', 'relationship', 'Spader', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'bad', 'thing', 'necessarily', 'was', 'only', 'interesting', 'characteristic.Marisa', 'Tomei', 'other', 'hand', 'subdued', 'performance', 'role', 'seemingly', 'custom-made', 'Lorraine', 'Bracco', 'reprise', 'role', 'Sopranos', 'obviously', 'been', 'too', 'long', 'My', 'Cousin', 'Vinney', 'won', 'Oscar', 'deserved', 'too', 'only', 'hope', 'more', 'discretion', 'when', 'choosing', 'future', 'not', 'even', 'only', 'actor', 'have', 'talents', 'put', 'waste', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'reduced', 'bit', 'part', 'here', 'even', 'when', 'manage', 'elbow', 'way', 'screen', 'face', 'time', 'usually', 'just', 'clench', 'jowl', 'look', 'angry', 'Chris', 'Ellis', 'one', 'actor', 'good', 'enough', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'box', 'office', 'hits', 'Armageddom', 'Godzilla', 'time', 'saddled', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'so', 'bad', 'practically', 'got', 'bullseye', 'painted', 'back.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'admit', 'found', 'movie', 'least', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'Still', 'good', 'qualities', 'are', 'half', 'dozen', 'bad', 'ones', 'ca', ""n't"", 'good', 'conscious', 'recommend', 'when', 'such', 'contemporary', 'classics', 'Manhunter', 'Vampires', 'Kiss', 'have', 'gone', 'widely', 'unwatched.All', 'decent', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'time', 'definately', 'not', 'worth', 'nine', 'dollars']",The Watcher
529764,A2JLSHTST2SP1I,B00003CXND,Danno,"[10, 10]","""The Watcher"" looks and sounds like a made-for-cable-TV thriller about a stalker/serial killer. I was surprised to learn that it got a theatrical release, which I think accounts for its many poor reviews. This isn't a terrible film by any means. Instead, it's a time killer that fans of either James Spader or Keanu Reeves will probably get a kick out of and there's some lovely location footage of Chicago to boot.Keanu Reeves plays a serial killer from James Spader's past. He tracks the former FBI agent down and starts killing young women again. This forces Spader to resume his career as an FBI agent; a decision that is fraught with drama because Spader is now burnt-out on police work and is virtually addicted to a variety of prescription drugs. There's nothing spectacularly intriguing or even novel about the film's premise or execution. But if you're a fan of Spader's TV work, you're going to like this one a lot, and it's fun to see Reeves play what is essentially an extended cameo cast against type. Marisa Tomei fans beware - the talented actress is almost totally wasted in a small, thankless role.Great cinema? Hardly.

Litton,"[5, 5]","&quot;It's never quite that easy... you go through the door, they're never just sitting there waiting for you with a welcoming smile on their face. Best you can do is hope they screw up and do what you can to be there when they do.&quot;&quot;The Watcher&quot; is the most recent addition to a long line of serial killer thriller films, and it does a somewhat commendable job in carrying out its plot. In reality, it is little more than a highly stylized showcase for all of the classic thriller cliches that have become so well-known throughout the last century, taking them and giving them an extra flare by using stunning cinematic tricks, a stellar cast and a pounding soundtrack. I am divided as to whether I like this movie or not: I enjoyed the vast array of shocking and vivid images, while I tended to become a bit bored by the cliches it portrayed throughout. I can't say that I completely hated this film, yet I cannot fully like it, either.The movie begins when FBI agent Joel Campbell begins receiving phone calls and photographs from his arch nemesis, a serial killer whose last alias was that of David Allen Griffin. He takes special care in killing lonely women with piano wire, leaving the scene of the crime with no trace of his identity. Campbell has a personal connection to Griffin: through his flashbacks, we see his attempt to rescue a woman trapped in a burning house, and his relationship to this woman as well as his involvement with Griffin will all be revealed in due time, one of the movie's attributes. The beginning of the movie may seem draggy the first fifteen minutes, as we are taken into the depths of Campbell's psychological and physical problems, but the movie will pick up once Griffin makes contact.We learn that Griffin has followed Campbell to Chicago from Los Angeles, out of some desire unknown to the audience. Campbell's therapist, Polly Beilman, believes that they have become so enamored with one another, the killer with eluding Campbell, and Campbell with catching his prey, that one would not know how to live without the other. Campbell receives a phone call from Griffin, who offers him a single chance to locate his victims within a 24-hour period of time. As he begins selecting his victims, the chase is on as Campbell picks up more clues and hints as to the location and identity of Griffin.Sounds good, right? So what is it about this thriller that partially ruins it? For me, it was the extensive amount of cliches that the movie contains, from the very beginning until the ending, which is a little unsatisfying. The movie contains its fair share of bungling cops who always arrive one minute too late to save the victim from their grizzly fate. This leaves it up to one man, the only smart one of the bunch, to try and decifer all the clues on his own, temporarily aided in scenes where he needs it. This formula has been used so many times, it's a bit of a letdown that script writers David Elliot and Clay Ayers could not come up with something more original.There is one of two good things about this movie, though, and that is its sense of style and filming techniques. The beginning sequences does a good job of instilling a slight sense of fear in the viewers, which is also carried on throughout the remainder of the film by the flashy cinematography which includes the grainy images as seen from Griffin's point of view, slow-motion flashbacks that leave us to use our imaginations when constructing crime scenes, and fast-moving scenes during intense action sequences. There is an offbeat vision and sensory style to this film which allows it to rise out of the depths of film hell. The soundtrack also adds a lot of pulsating bass beats to add to the unease intended by the filmmakers, while also delivering a killer soundtrack of alternative music to accompany the pursuits.This movie is also not unlike one of Reeves' others films, &quot;Chain Reaction,&quot; which contained some of the best action sequences while possessing a faulty story. The case for this movie is similar, as there is another stunning cavalcade of action effects and suspense-building scenes. The cops-versus-Griffin chase scenes offer a lot in terms of suspense, while also keeping the movie going at a steady pace. Another turnon for the film is the way in which the murder scenes are carried out. There is not a vast amount of blood or gore in these scenes, which allows us to use more of our imagination in putting it together as it happens. I like it when a movie is able to do this, instead of taking gore and passing it off as art.Actors for &quot;The Watcher&quot; deliver quality performances that make the movie enjoyable. James Spader plays the delusional detective Joel Campbell, and he does a perfect job in delivering Campbell's emotions when it comes to pursuing his target. We are able to believe in his not wanting to give up despite the effects it may have on him physically and emotionally. Spader plays Campbell as a stern and aggressive character, the character to root for throughout. Keanu Reeves plays his rival, David Allen Griffin, and does one of his better acting jobs here. This is material he was born to play... he possesses wit and a certain twisted charm that is intrical to Griffin's character, and that makes him a better serial killer than most other movies. Oscar winner Marisa Tomei plays therapist Polly Beilman, though she is not really able to display a lot of her talent in this film, as it focuses mainly on the two leads and their physical and psychological battle with one another.I give &quot;The Watcher&quot; three stars on the basis of its cinematography, its acting, its action sequences, and its unrealized potential. The story does leave a lot to be desired in terms of originality, but it can be a lot of fun if you don't think too much about it. The fast pace of the film never hinders, and the actors never fail in giving us performances to cheer for. We almost wish we could extract the characters and place them in a different movie, but nonetheless, it remains enjoyable on a strictly basic level.",3,"Nice filming techniques, solid

529769,A2BQBLCKJHP65G,B00003CXND,"Eric Ericson ""RedSabbath""","[0, 0]","Okay, who's bright idea was it to cast Keanu Reeves as the serial killer while having James Spader as the good guy cop?!!? Shouldn't of that been the other way around? While that's just one of the problems with The Watcher, it's easy to see why this film is buried in the Reeves library. Keanu plays a serial killer from California who somehow becomes infatuated with a detective that been on his tail ever since his first young female kill. When he kills a woman that Spader was having an affair with, it breaks the detective and he quits the Force, relocating to Chicago. Heartbroken, Reeves' character also moves to the Windy City, restarts his killing rampage, and gets Spader back on the case, all for the thrill of the chase.While this film has a few decent thriller aspects, along with a good acting job by Spader & a ""phoning-in"" Marisa Tomei, the whole idea of Keanu as a piano-wire carrying murderer is never truly believed. Even more terrifying is when Reeves tries to play ""crazy"" by doing a dance that would even make Batman's Adam West or John Travolta's Vincent Vega giggle. Overall, this is one flix that plays more like an ABC Network pilot for James Spader's character that didn't work out in favor for his Boston Legal. Only recommended to viewers that still don't understand that casting is one of the most important parts of filmmaking.(RedSabbath Rating:6.5/10)",2,"""Whoa Dude, Your Gun Is Actually Loaded!""

The Watcher is a film so dull that the very fact is called a thriller makes me laugh uncontrollably. Nothing in this film works. From the beginning we are introduced to the neurotic detective (Spader) who can not sleep because he never got to catch that one killer who outsmart him (they got pretty original with this script) Then we are also introduced to the killer (Reeves) who is randomly dancing (first laugh out loud segment in the movie) well to be honest Im not sure if he was really dancing but well lets say he was doing his thing. So we already know who is who and what they both want so there is no real mystery. That would be fine if there was some tension on their relationship but Spader and Reeves seem to be working in complete different movies. Specially Reeves who plays his part in the most pedestrian way, he says Im going to kill you in the same way he says good morning. With no change in tempo, pitch, enthusiasm. Even a robot has more charm. Oh and I almost forgot about Tomei who is Spaders psychiatrist and by the end is going to end up in someones hand?? No u dont know? For realz? ok then maybe this movies is really for you. Anyways some plot-less movies still have value added by their special effects and suspenseful chasing sequences.

529773,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CXND,"""flickjunkie""","[0, 0]","This psychological thriller doesn't quite come together due to various flaws in the script and poor orchestration by a rookie director.  Director Joe Charbanic's prior experience is with music videos.  This is his first feature film.  It is reported that he landed the project at the recommendation of Keanu Reeves, who liked his work.  As is the case with many music video directors, Charbanic is extremely creative with the camera.  He uses innovative camera angles, close-ups, jump cuts and strobe photography very effectively.  Along with veteran cinematographer Michael Chapman (""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Rising Sun"", ""Primal Fear""), he brings some very compelling imagery to the screen.  However, this is only part of the director's job.  He must also pull the story together and eliminate any inconsistencies from the script.  Most importantly, he must get the actors to properly interpret their characters.  In these areas, Charbanic is far less capable and it hurts the film.The initial workup is intriguing.  David Allen Griffin (Keanu Reeves) is a serial killer who has developed an obsession with Joel Campbell (James Spader), the cop who has been pursuing him.  When the cop retires from the force on disability and moves to Chicago, the killer follows and resumes the killings there to torment his adversary.  Griffin sends Campbell pictures of his victims in advance and dares him to try to find them before he kills them.  The story is fairly tight to this point, but unravels totally after Griffin lures Campbell to a graveyard and they meet face to face.  From this point forward, the absurdities are piled on to the point of silliness.The acting is problematic.  Keanu Reeves is an excellent actor, but he is miscast as the killer.  He is just too nice a guy to be a sociopath.  Actually, it probably would have been better if they flipped the leads because Spader would have made a very believable killer.  Spader is excellent at portraying Campbell's decaying life, but his portrayal is wrong for the action roles.  Normally dynamic and energetic, Marisa Tomei seems almost comatose in her dialogue with Spader during the therapy scenes, although she is great as the terrified victim after being abducted.  The entire cast seems flat and subdued especially for a thriller, the responsibility for which I put with Charbanic.  While Charbanic's images crackle, the actors are soggy.  Although images are important in a suspense thriller, they cannot make up for flaccid performances.I was disappointed in this film.  I rated it 6/10 on the strength of the photography.

While it does hold some entertainment value it completely lacks in originality and character development.  There are no tremendous WOWs that surface as the film progresses.James Spader does a fair job with the role of Campbell, an FBI agent who moved from L.A. to Chicago to escape the memories of a haunting unsolved series of murders. The problem is that the psychopathic killer Griffin (Keanu Reeves) has followed him. Griffin puts Agent Campbell is a deadly game of beat the clock each time he takes another girl. The question is, Will Campbell catch him before the stakes becomes personal yet again?  This question is answered in a predictable climax.While the plot is unoriginal it still remains interesting. The main problem is that Reeves does not give his character what it needs.  Where Griffin should be maniacal he comes across as silly .  The character is nowhere near as menacing as he should be.  James Spader and Maris Tomei are O.K. but they fail to deliver the pop that would have made this film a four star affair.Overall the film isnt that exciting nor is it that boring.

Keanu Reeves is definitely the downfall of this movie. If you can look past the lousy acting from him as the psychopath who strangles young women with piano wire, you'll be satisfied after watching this. It was an okay movie with a definite flaw. Keanu is just not intimidating, and couldn't portray a person who would be. The Watcher was entertaining, and James Spader carried it well. It had some intense scenes, and an interesting plot which made it somewhat worthwhile. I certainly would not and will not add it to my DVD collection though. There wasn't really anything that stood out to me that was any different or more unique than any other thriller I've seen. It was average. I would not recommend that children see it though.

529779,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00003CXND,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 3]","Another serial killer, will you say. Yes. But this one has some originality, though not in subject or theme but in emphasis. The emphasis is set on the ambiguous relation between the serial killer and one particular investigator, as well as between the investigator and one particular victim. The investigator saved the last victim from the piano string of the killer but instead of freeing her so that she could escape from the last trap the killer had set, he runs after the killer and will come back, when he realizes his mistake, but too late. This investigator will follow the victim from Los Angeles to Chicago and the killer will follow the investigator the same way and start killing again in Chicago. This killer sets his new series of murders as a direct provocation and challenge to the investigator. They will finally confront each other and the relation appears to be self nourishing and self destructive. The stake is who will win. Of course the investigator who uses his portable phone creatively, and the killer will not realize it, and because the investigator will find a weapon in the most improbable place possible at the right moment. The killer appears then as a cannibal personality who needs this relation with the investigator as if he were a brother of his, so he says, but that brother will betray his brotherly killer. This raises a question that is not too difficult to answer. Who is the real Cain ? The killer who is trying to invade and possess the investigator, and eventually destroy him ? The investigator who accepts to go along with his forced relationship with the killer but trying to betray him all along and destroying him in the end ? It is easy to answer because we cannot accept murdering people as an ethical or even reasonable basis for such a relation between two people. Our ethics says that killing and murdering are evil by definition. Which means Cain is killed in the end by Abel.

529780,A1MMKUAZAKL395,B00003CXND,Jevron Mc Crory,"[4, 4]","Now this is what we need more of; pretty boy actors renowned for nice guy roles taking a walk off the beaten commercial path to explore darker subject matter.In Joe Charbanic's twisted little pressure cooker of a movie The Watcher, Keanu Reeves not only wandered into seriously more disturbing material, he took a tent with him, threw away the compass and camped comfortably in it, the results of which include a transformation that's as far away from Neo, his Matrix alter ego, as humanly possible. It's plausible that The Chosen One himself might have turned tail and fled if ever faced with Keanu's chillingly charismatic 'Watcher'(the killer of this piece), whether he knew Kung Fu or not.Publicly violated and torn apart frame by bloody frame by the critics upon release, The Watcher, ironically enough, should be thankful that the reviews were so scathing. All this highly inaccurate reviewing does is further serve to lower your guard for what becomes a truly tense and highly strung game of cat and mouse. Taking the classic story of nemesis and cop and training a television camera on it, Reeves portrays David Allen Griffin, a smartly dressed and suave individual with a penchant for strangling young single woman with piano wire. After feeling abandoned by the FBI agent Joel Campbell (played with praise-worthy restraint by the impeccable James Spader) who was assigned to his case and who Griffin has come to admire and, in a way, almost depend upon to give his vocation validity in the grand scheme of things, Griffin relocates to Chicago in order to pick up on their unique relationship afresh, news that awakens a buried dread within the distraught and regretful Campbell. It's only a matter of time before Griffin is, once again, rendering his piano unplayable, dragging Campbell once more into a nightmarish paranoid world where every second counts.Charbanic's tale presents the unfolding events from an original and distinctive perspective, one that lends itself admirably to the director's strengths. Namely, the media. With the superb inclusion of Griffin 'willing to try and make things work' between himself and Campbell by sending the agent photographs of the targeted victim and allowing the police twenty four hours to locate her, it serves as the perfect motive for the movie to truly tighten the tension screws which it succeeds in doing in excruciatingly spectacular fashion. The plot weaves tighter and tighter like Griffin's piano wire as by each murder, we witness Campbell's deterioration as the horrifying realisation that he may not be capable of saving the victims becomes an increasingly real sensation, a matter touched upon in a beautifully downplayed sombre moment between Campbell and his counsellor, played with admirable strength and vulnerability by Oscar winner Marisa Tomei.Add to this stew the wonderfully haunting score, the truly shocking yet undeniably sylish violence and decidedly unsettling cinematography and you begin to wonder why The Watcher was ever so persecuted in the first place.

529784,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,B00003CXND,"John ""MovieAddict""","[2, 2]","You know when a movie boasts &quot;and Keanu Reeves&quot; you're in pretty big trouble.Sometimes I go with the general flow when I put down actors. For example, Adam Sandler doesn't really bother me. He was perfect for &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; (which I think is a great mindless comedy). But Keanu Reeves is one actor that I, personally, have never considered a great--much less good--actor. In &quot;Bill and Ted&quot; and &quot;The Matrix&quot; he's fine, yes, because he fits the parts given to him (new generation slackers).&quot;Speed&quot; is one of my all-time favorite action films, but not really because of Reeves himself.The movies in which he is supposed to display true emotions--such as &quot;Feeling Minnesota&quot; or &quot;A Walk in the Clouds&quot;--are the ones that bother me, because I know that there are better actors putting on school plays who aren't getting paid--yet he's raking in the millions. Many of his dramatic roles are rather dry and laughable. When it comes to *real* roles, Keanu just fails miserably.I'll explain why, since I'll probably get angry letters from &quot;Matrix&quot; fans and teenage girls with posters of him on their walls if I don't. My main problem with Reeves is that he's always the same. His face is always the same. His tone of voice. His expressions. His mannerisms. For the sake of comparison, imagine Dustin Hoffman in &quot;Rain Man.&quot; Now imagine Keanu Reeves trying to play Raymond Babbitt. See what I mean?I've been observing Reeves since his days of &quot;Bill and Ted,&quot; and my aunt adores him. I've been fed his movies for a long time. When I saw him in &quot;Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure,&quot; I thought he had talent. That he could really fit roles easily. Then I realized that he really WAS Ted, and that's when my expectations dropped.But I don't want to turn this into a Keanu Reeves hating fest. The point of all those paragraphs is just an explanation of why I'm not a big fan of Mr. Keanu &quot;Whoa&quot; Reeves, or his dramatic cinematic ventures. I say that he should stay close to what he's good at (dumb slackers). But that's just me.In &quot;The Watcher,&quot; Keanu is a serial killer who toys around with an ex-FBI Agent (James Spader) whose lover Keanu killed years before in a fire. (Bad, Keanu, bad!) In fact, Joel Campbell (Spader) moved all the way to Chicago in order to escape his past, and even retired from the FBI.Now David (Reeves) is back in Joel's life, sending him pictures of victims a day before they are to be murdered. He has twenty-four hours to find them before David does.What a great premise. A pleasant twist on the serial killer routine, right? Err...no, not really. The direction feels like a long action-packed music video--from the opening titles blaring a loud Rob Zombie song to the end, complete with the stereotypical Killer's Point of View that was original in 1978 when John Carpenter's &quot;Halloween&quot; first invented it (and when it was indeed a very controversial filmmaking technique), but is now getting old since it's frequently being used incorrectly, particularly in the case of &quot;The Watcher.&quot; Keanu's character seems to see things through some type of strobe music video vision--perhaps that explains his love of music in the film. &quot;This is a good song,&quot; he says to one victim before strangling her.In all honesty, &quot;The Watcher&quot; isn't really a truly &quot;bad&quot; movie (in fact, I've seen much worse), but if I had to pinpoint the problems with &quot;The Watcher,&quot; it would be these three things:1. Direction. Joe Charbanic, a first-time director with his outing in &quot;The Watcher,&quot; proves that he should never get behind a camera ever again. As I mentioned before, there are just too many moments when I felt that I was watching some music video or product placement commercial instead of a smart serial killer film. Some people just aren't meant to get behind the wheel of a moving car. The same goes for a moving reel of footage.2. The Script. What starts interesting and even compelling soon turns into a routine chase-the-killer film with extravagant car chases and bad character introductions. (Marisa Tomei's student psychiatrist is obviously there for two reasons--to fall in love with the hero and to be kidnapped by the villain. Take a wild guess if it happens or not.) In fact, this film had loads of potential to stand out amongst the rest of its kind by using the original plot--twenty-four hours to find the victim--but it is soon left forgotten and too many plot holes (why wouldn't the victim see herself on TV or on one of the millions of ads placed around Chicago?) are left unchecked.3. The Acting. James Spader is at the very least marginally convincing as a gruff I-Don't-Care-Anymore cop, but he's no Martin Riggs. Instead, he comes off as a whiny, selfish little creep who likes to inject drugs into his body to get a momentary high. This is are hero, folks.Also, is Keanu an invincible boogeyman or not? Lord knows that his mysterious character, David, is untouchable--he survives a foot chase without being seen, he manages to sneak past security cameras and cops and manages to kidnap/kill female victims; he survives a truly ludicrous car chase (that lowered my score for the film by a half a notch), gets shot, caught on fire, and STILL manages to jump out of a window on fire and into a lake? I half expected him to get up once more and give us all one last scare. Honestly, in &quot;Halloween,&quot; the insinuations of Michael Myers' invincibility were more than hinted at. Here, we are left to wonder whether or not the killer is some type of supernatural force or not. The film is too eager to wrap all the loose ends up without digging deeper into the material.",2,Missed Opportunities,1073952000,"01 13, 2004",2004,5789,"['know', 'when', 'movie', 'quot', 'Keanu',

Some movies make great rentals on a rainy Sunday and this was perfect as it kept me guessing to the outcome to the twisted and complex story about a serial killer and the detective on his back.James Spader (who was also great in Boston Legal, Secretary, Stargate, Wolf) did a great job portraying Joel Campbell, a retired detective who had moved on with his life after an enigmatic past that wakes him up in cold sweat and nightmares. He is clearly not over whatever happened to him back on the west coast and is trying to get his life back as he sees a shrink (Marisa Tomei) to help him out. His daily grind is un-interrupted by a murder that happens in his own building and when he finds a letter mailed to him, postmarked three days before the murder happened with the girls picture in it he is more than concerned. Spader recognizes the situation as the nightmare scenario that he escaped from as it trespasses on his turf and makes his life hell again. He knows that the mysterious man known as Griffin played by Keanu Reeves is obsessed with him and has tracked him down, sending him cards and pictures of his next victims. He gives Spader till 9pm each day to find the victim or he kills them; chocking from behind with piano wire leaving a trail of blood and pain behind.Campbell must find the potential victims and save them, as they are tied to the mystery why he retired and ran away. To find closure and peace he must salvage all his strength, clever tactics, his rather barbaric people skills and his fading mental capabilities to catch Griffin and to avenge a death close to his heart.I enjoyed the twists and turns and having seen failure and struggle instead of smooth sailing for the main character as he slips and falls but then gets up and fights back made it non-predictable and fun.",4,Underrated and quite enjoyable little movie,1151193600,"06 25, 2006",2006,1939,"['mixed', 'reviews', 'found', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'purchase', 'was', 'disappointment', 'level', 'movies', 'make', 'great', 'rentals', 'rainy', 'Sunday', 'was', 'perfect', 'kept', 'guessing', 'outcome', 'twisted', 'complex', 'story', 'serial', 'killer', 'detective', 'back.James', 'Spader', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'Secretary', 'Stargate', 'Wolf', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'Joel', 'Campbell', 'retired', 'detective', 'who', 'had', 'moved', 'life', 'enigmatic', 'past', 'up', 'cold', 'sweat', 'nightmares', 'clearly', 'not', 'happened', 'back', 'west', 'coast', 'trying', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'shrink', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'help', 'out', 'daily', 'grind', 'un-interrupted', 'murder', 'own', 'building', 'when', 'letter', 'mailed', 'postmarked', 'three', 'days', 'murder', 'happened', 'girls', 'picture', 'more', 'concerned', 'Spader', 'situation', 'nightmare', 'scenario', 'escaped', 'turf', 'life', 'hell', 'again', 'mysterious', 'man', 'known', 'Griffin', 'played', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'obsessed', 'tracked', 'down', 'sending', 'cards', 'pictures', 'next', 'victims', 'Spader', 'till', '9pm', 'day', 'find', 'victim', 'chocking', 'piano', 'wire', 'leaving', 'trail', 'blood', 'pain', 'behind.Campbell', 'must', 'find', 'potential', 'victims', 'save', 'are', 'tied', 'mystery', 'why', 'retired', 'ran', 'away', 'find', 'closure', 'peace', 'must', 'salvage', 'strength', 'clever', 'tactics', 'rather', 'barbaric', 'people', 'skills', 'fading', 'mental', 'capabilities', 'catch', 'Griffin', 'avenge', 'death', 'close', 'heart.I', 'enjoyed', 'twists', 'turns', 'having', 'seen', 'failure', 'struggle', 'instead', 'smooth', 'sailing', 'main', 'character', 'falls', 'then', 'up', 'fights', 'back', 'made', 'non-predictable', 'fun']",The Watcher

529794,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXND,Matthew Horner,"[1, 1]","The Watcher is one of those movies where you might find yourself thinking of what it might have been. The basis of a nifty little thriller is there, but in the hands of director Joe Charbanic, the story never flowers. There are all sorts of ultra chic film techniques and editing tricks. These are interesting enough to watch. They demonstrate that the visual arts still have some unchartered territory. In this case they also serve to emphasis the fact that the film is all style and no substance.FBI agent Joel Campbell [James Spader] moves from Los Angeles to Chicago after a shattering experience in which his girlfriend becomes a victim of the same serial killer Campbell has been looking for. The man is now a wreck. He takes pills for depression and anxiety and must often inject himself with a drug for his crippling migraine headaches. He is seeing a therapist named Polly [Marisa Tomei]. One day Joe comes home to find police swarming around the apartment below his. A girl has been murdered. After an agonizing night of nightmares and migraines, Joe gets around to opening his mail the next morning. There is a FedEx package which contains photos of his murdered neighbor. He realizes that the killer he pursed in L. A. has come to Chicago. And what comes next is a gruesome game in which the hunter becomes the hunted and is taunted in the same way the police sometimes do to a criminal at large. Joe receives more photos and has twenty-four hours in each case to save the victim.This truly could have been a taunt and suspenseful movie, if the director hadn't dropped the ball so often. Elements that start off interesting wind up going nowhere. For example, much is made by the therapist about how much Joe and the killer, David [Keanu Reeves], need each other, but no valid explanation of this codependency is ever offered. No reason is offered for David's doing the things he does nor is there anything about his character or mannerisms to hint at a motive.James Spader gives us a great performance, but because Keanu Reeves has to work at being creepy and Spader doesn't, it might have been better if they had traded roles. I have always enjoyed Reeves's taking roles that are a stretch or a risk for him, but I have decided that he is successful commercially and artistically only in action hero epics like Speed and The Matrix. Tomei's role is small and is important only as a plot device. She deserves better.",2,This watcher hardly bears watching,1016323200,"03 17, 2002",2002,2429,"['Watcher', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'might', 'find', 'thinking', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'basis', 'nifty', 'little', 'thriller', 'there', 'hands', 'director', 'Joe', 'Charbanic', 'story', 'never', 'flowers', 'are', 'sorts', 'ultra', 'chic', 'film', 'techniques', 'editing', 'tricks', 'are', 'interesting', 'enough', 'watch', 'demonstrate', 'visual', 'arts', 'still', 'have', 'unchartered', 'territory', 'case', 'also', 'serve', 'emphasis', 'fact', 'film', 'style', 'substance.FBI', 'agent', 'Joel', 'Campbell', '[', 'James', 'Spader', ']', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Chicago', 'shattering', 'experience', 'girlfriend', 'victim', 'same', 'serial', 'killer', 'Campbell', 'been', 'looking', 'man', 'now', 'wreck', 'pills', 'depression', 'anxiety', 'must', 'often', 'inject', 'drug', 'crippling', 'migraine', 'headaches', 'seeing', 'therapist', 'named', 'Polly', '[', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', ']', 'One', 'day', 'Joe', 'home', 'find', 'police', 'swarming', 'apartment', 'girl', 'been', 'murdered', 'agonizing', 'night', 'nightmares', 'migraines', 'Joe', 'around', 'opening', 'mail', 'next', 'morning', 'FedEx', 'package', 'photos', 'murdered', 'neighbor', 'killer', 'pursed', 'L.', 'A.', 'come', 'Chicago', 'what', 'next', 'gruesome', 'game', 'hunter', 'hunted', 'taunted', 'same', 'way', 'police', 'sometimes', 'do', 'criminal', 'large', 'Joe', 'more', 'photos', 'twenty-four', 'hours', 'case', 'save', 'victim.This', 'truly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'taunt', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'director', 'had', ""n't"", 'dropped', 'ball', 'so', 'often', 'Elements', 'start', 'interesting', 'wind', 'up', 'going', 'nowhere', 'example', 'much', 'made', 'therapist', 'how', 'much', 'Joe', 'killer', 'David', '[', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', ']', 'need', 'other', 'valid', 'explanation', 'codependency', 'ever', 'offered', 'reason', 'offered', 'David', 'doing', 'things', 'there', 'anything', 'character', 'mannerisms', 'hint', 'motive.James', 'Spader', 'great', 'performance', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'work', 'being', 'creepy', 'Spader', ""n't"", 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'traded', 'roles', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Reeves', 'taking', 'roles', 'are', 'stretch', 'risk', 'have', 'decided', 'successful', 'commercially', 'artistically', 'only', 'action', 'hero', 'epics', 'Speed', 'Matrix', 'Tomei', 'role', 'small', 'important', 'only', 'plot', 'device', 'better']",The Watcher
529795,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00003CXND,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[0, 0]","This film feels more like a direct-to-video rather than a megaplex-worthy feature. This was probably originally billed as a James Spader movie, yet Keanu Reeves comes onto the scene and struggles to act the bad guy, alongside the other two, bit-part celebrities.Keanu was originally never supposed to do this film. According to him, a friend faked his signature and signed the contract, forcing him to do the film for a much smaller actor's salary than he's used to. But thankfully for Keanu, his part as the bad guy, serial killer got extended, and he's in the movie a lot more than originally scripted.Unfortunately, this movie comes across as being severely miscast. Keanu isn't really as evil as he was in The Gift, where he played another rare bad guy in his career. James Spader and Marisa Tomei are good in small doses, as supporting actors in other films, but they don't really light up the screen enough to succeed as lead actors.There is virtually no suspense or insight in this and a lot of visual tricks are used to cover up what is lacking. It's pretty much known what is going to happen.To give some of the plot away, this is one of the first films where Keanu dies. Sorry guys, but you know it's gonna happen, he's a serial killer. Of course, his character has never died in a movie, not that I know of anyway; I only have (unlucky) 13 of his films. Most of his earlier films haven't been released on DVD, and I suppose some of them I'll never get to see. I suppose you could technically say he died in Devil's Advocate, except afterwards it was like a dream, and it was what could have happened. And I suppose you could say he kinda died in the Matrix too.What I really hate about Keanu - yes, me, I actually hate something about him - is that in Matrix, and a couple of other films, he's so lean and athletic looking, almost skinny. Or in Speed, with all those lovely muscles. But then in Chain Reaction, or The Watcher, The Gift, he's let himself go. The hair is all long and straggly, he's all chubby, and since he's hitting the big four oh this year, he's definitely going for the middle age spread. In these films, you can probably get an insight into the real Keanu - not cutting his hair, not looking after himself etc.Nothing against James Spader or Marisa Tomei, but maybe if this film had more A-list stars in it, it might have been more of a success. Plus there are no extras on the DVD, not even a trailer (yikes!). If I'd known what it was like before I got it, then I probably wouldn't have bought it. But it's my 13th Keanu Reeves film, and it was only 3.

529797,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00003CXND,Michael Butts,"[0, 1]","The stars of THE WATCHER have had interesting and varied careers.  James Spader who burst on the scene in SEX LIES AND VIDEOTAPE and then went on to such flicks as SUPER NOVA, JACK'S BACK and the current tv series THE PRACTICE, plays Joel Campbell with a sense of emotional detachment and fierce reserve.  He's almost like a powder keg waiting to erupt.  For me, there was no cathartic eruption, and I felt Campbell should have been played by a more intense and complex actor, say like Sean Penn or Colin Farrell.  Even so, Spader is effective in those scenes where this detachment works.  He just doesn't bring any real intensity to his performance.Keanu Reeves, ah, what can one say about this attractive if dramatically challenged thespian?  Think of him in BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE...or DANGEROUS LIAISONS or BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA...or most all of his films.  As animated as a cucumber.  But, there is hope, I think.  While far from great in this role, he does bring a lot of life to his role, which is surprisingly underwritten.  But if he can achieve this type of talent as also displayed in THE GIFT, Keanu may become an actor yet.Marisa Tomei of course won everyone's puzzled surprise when she won an Oscar for MY COUSIN VINNY.  Remember---they even said that the actor presenting the award read the wrong name.  Well, Marisa remained dormant for a while until she came back with her strong Oscar nominated performance for IN THE BEDROOM.  Alas and alack, there's not much Tomei does in this role.  Embarassingly underwritten, Tomei serves little purpose and shows little emotion in this psychiatrist role.With all that in mind, it's still a very entertaining, tense serial killer thriller.  The victims are all worth feeling for, and Reeves' brutal nonchalance is chilling.

I was hoping that The Watcher would provide the answer.  Netflix to the rescue!The plot of The Watcher revolves around Joel Campbell (James Spader), a former FBI agent who has moved from L.A. to Chicago to escape his demons.  And his demons are many, including an affair with a married woman, the death of said married woman, and the choice Joel had to make between catching a serial killer (David Allen Giffin played by Mr. Reeves) or letting the woman he loves burn to death.  Unfortunately, Joel was too late to save her.Joel moves to escape his past, but his past moves with him.  David decides to relocate his serial killing activities to Chicago and continue their game of cat-and-mouse.  He's gotten so used to killing that Joel is now a part of the thrill of the hunt.  So David invents a little game: he mails a picture of his next victim to Joel, who has until 9 p.m. that day to find her before it's too late.In the middle of all this is Dr. Polly Beilman (the lovely Marisa Tomei), Joel's psychiatrist.  She tries to help Joel deal with his issues:  he never really sleeps and has perpetual migraines.  Can you guess why she's in this film kids? I knew you could!There are two powerful flaws that make the film distracting instead of creepy.PROBLEM #1: The film alternates between several ""point of view"" speeds.  One of them is the normal film of day-to-day life.  The second is Stalker Cam, from the perspective of David who watches his victims.  Just to mix things up, occasionally the screens flashes bright white and we hear the sound of a camera flash.  `Cause David's watching.  Get it? The third and worst film speed is the Memory Cam. We see bits and pieces of Joel's past life and the death of his lover in weird, Six Million Dollar Man slow motion blur.  It's annoying the first time and becomes extremely tedious as the film revisits the same scene over and over and over.  Worse, this effect is used whenever action takes place on screen.  It's almost as if the director didn't know what to do during action scenes and resorted to blurring things a lot to cover it all up.PROBLEM #2: At bizarre, inappropriate times, we get rock music interludes.  The music varies so widely in scope that it never establishes a mood.  American Psycho used music to excellent effect (covering up the screams of the victims as well as establishing the decade of the movie).  In The Watcher, it's like someone flipped to MTV during the boring parts.The main thrust of the film is the horrible anonymity that we all suffer in cities.  Even though Joel knows who's going to die, even though the police put posters of the victim everywhere, even though the TV news broadcasts who the victim is...nobody notices these poor, lonely girls.  It's a compelling message that's utterly lost in this film.The actors work with what they've got.  Spader comes off as patently unlikable.  Tomei looks bored.  Everyone else is there to act as typical foils.  Reeves' dialogue makes him sound and act like an idiot.And that's the problem.  Serial killers are human wrecks, built from abuse and neglect.  We never learn more about David and why he does what he does.  To make him truly frightening, we need to get inside his head (stalker cams don't count).  But half the time The Watcher is about Joel, who comes off as kind of a jerk.  Heck, David's kills aren't even scary.  The trailer showed David's shadow as he strangled a woman with piano wire...but get this, it was SPED UP.In other words, the guys making the trailer decided the murder scenes in The Watcher were too boring, so they sped it up for the trailer.  That one scene was what made me want to see the movie.  But in the actual film, that scene is filmed in slow motion flash.  Forget Joel's migraines, The Watcher tries to give YOU a migraine.This is Joe Charbanic's first film as a director and presumably his last, since IMDB doesn't list anything else since 2000 when The Watcher was made. It shows.",2,Don't Watcher,1112486400,"04 3, 2005",2005,4078,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'believed', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'would', 'make', 'really', 'good', 'bad', 'guy', 'ever', 'saw', 'action', 'Gift', 'was', 'hoping', 'Watcher', 'would', 'provide', 'answer', 'Netflix', 'rescue', 'plot', 'Watcher', 'Joel', 'Campbell', 'James', 'Spader', 'former', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'moved', 'L.A.', 'Chicago', 'escape', 'demons', 'demons', 'are', 'many', 'including', 'affair', 'married', 'woman', 'death', 'said', 'married', 'woman', 'choice', 'Joel', 'had', 'make', 'catching', 'serial', 'killer', 'David', 'Allen', 'Giffin', 'played', 'Mr.', 'Reeves', 'letting', 'woman', 'burn', 'death', 'Unfortunately', 'Joel', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'save', 'her.Joel', 'moves', 'escape', 'past', 'past', 'moves', 'David', 'relocate', 'serial', 'killing', 'activities', 'Chicago', 'continue', 'game', 'cat-and-mouse', 'gotten', 'so', 'used', 'killing', 'Joel', 'now', 'part', 'thrill', 'hunt', 'So', 'David', 'little', 'game', 'picture', 'next', 'victim', 'Joel', 'who', '9', 'p.m.', 'day', 'find', 'too', 'late.In', 'middle', 'Dr.', 'Polly', 'Beilman', 'lovely', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Joel', 'psychiatrist', 'help', 'Joel', 'deal', 'issues', 'never', 'really', 'sleeps', 'perpetual', 'migraines', 'Can', 'guess', 'why', 'film', 'kids', 'knew', 'could', 'are', 'two', 'powerful', 'flaws', 'make', 'film', 'distracting', 'instead', 'creepy.PROBLEM', '1', 'film', 'several', 'point', 'view', 'speeds', 'One', 'normal', 'film', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'second', 'Stalker', 'Cam', 'perspective', 'David', 'who', 'victims', 'Just', 'mix', 'things', 'up', 'occasionally', 'screens', 'flashes', 'bright', 'white', 'hear', 'sound', 'camera', 'flash', 'Cause', 'David', 'watching', 'Get', 'third', 'worst', 'film', 'speed', 'Memory', 'Cam', 'see', 'bits', 'pieces', 'Joel', 'past', 'life', 'death', 'lover', 'weird', 'Six', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Man', 'slow', 'motion', 'blur', 'annoying', 'first', 'time', 'extremely', 'tedious', 'film', 'same', 'scene', 'over', 'Worse', 'effect', 'used', 'whenever', 'action', 'place', 'screen', 'almost', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'action', 'scenes', 'resorted', 'blurring', 'things', 'lot', 'cover', 'up.PROBLEM', '2', 'bizarre', 'inappropriate', 'times', 'get', 'rock', 'music', 'interludes', 'music', 'so', 'widely', 'scope', 'never', 'mood', 'American', 'Psycho', 'used', 'music', 'excellent', 'effect', 'covering', 'up', 'screams', 'victims', 'as', 'well', 'establishing', 'decade', 'movie', 'Watcher', 'someone', 'flipped', 'MTV', 'boring', 'parts.The', 'main', 'thrust', 'film', 'horrible', 'anonymity', 'suffer', 'cities', 'Even', 'Joel', 'who', 'going', 'die', 'even', 'police', 'put', 'posters', 'victim', 'everywhere', 'even', 'TV', 'news', 'broadcasts', 'who', 'victim', 'nobody', 'poor', 'lonely', 'girls', 'compelling', 'message', 'utterly', 'lost', 'film.The', 'actors', 'work', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Spader', 'off', 'patently', 'unlikable', 'Tomei', 'bored', 'Everyone', 'else', 'there', 'act', 'typical', 'foils', 'Reeves', 'dialogue', 'sound', 'act', 'idiot.And', 'problem', 'Serial', 'killers', 'are', 'human', 'wrecks', 'built', 'abuse', 'neglect', 'never', 'learn', 'more', 'David', 'why', 'what', 'make', 'truly', 'frightening', 'need', 'get', 'head', 'stalker', 'cams', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'time', 'Watcher', 'Joel', 'who', 'off', 'kind', 'jerk', 'Heck', 'David', 'kills', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'scary', 'trailer', 'showed', 'David', 'shadow', 'strangled', 'woman', 'piano', 'wire', 'get', 'was', 'SPED', 'UP.In', 'other', 'words', 'guys', 'making', 'trailer', 'decided', 'murder', 'scenes', 'Watcher', 'were', 'too', 'boring', 'sped', 'up', 'trailer', 'one', 'scene', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'actual', 'film', 'scene', 'filmed', 'slow', 'motion', 'flash', 'Forget', 'Joel', 'migraines', 'Watcher', 'tries', 'give', 'YOU', 'migraine.This', 'Joe', 'Charbanic', 'first', 'film', 'director', 'presumably', 'last', 'IMDB', ""n't"", 'list', 'anything', 'else', '2000', 'when', 'Watcher', 'was', 'made']",The Watcher

I wonder how other reviewers find this flick full of suspense and good performances (well, it depends with whom you compare, of course. The world has seen worse, certainly. ""Return of killing tomatoes"", for example).J Spader used to be a good actor, but he's nothing to do here besides faking migraines (unpersuasively) and acting completely out of FBI-protocol and sane person's mind. Why K Reeves was cast as the serial killer here escapes my understanding: besides having black hair and black eyes (attributes hinting at his maliciousness, no doubt), he's ridiculous dancing in slo-mo in front of his victims, harassing the detective and voicing his text with as much pomp as you can withstand. Also please tell me who decided that heavy panting of him behind the frame augments the tension?Although the plot follows the well-trodden lane of such flicks, the facts and details are thrown at the viewer chaotically, probably supposing he'll accept everything (hate this concept!). M Tomei's character serves the only purpose she can have in such a movie, but her involvement with Spader (besides the fact that she's his shrink) is so poor and unemotional, no one cares about her.

Despite a fairly good performance from Keanu Reeves, who goes back to the days of playing the disaffected sociopaths that made him great (River's Edge, Permanent Record), this film straddles the line between confusion and predictability with a deftness I've rarely seen even from the most incompetent veteran directors. Charbanic and Jensen are to be commended for achieving Russ Meyer status on their very first try.Joel Campbell (James Spader) had a breakdown after he saved his married girlfriend (Yvonne Niami) from a serial killer he'd been tracking in Los Angeles for years. Unfortunately, she still dies, as a direct result of his clumsiness (watch the film a couple of times, you'll figure out how to put all these pieces together... I think). Campbell moved to Chicago in order to be near her grave and get away from the job for a while, and now spends his time taking huge amounts of antipsychotics and living on disability pay. Of course, the serial killer (Reeves) follows him, and the game begins again.Reeves-- and Ernie Hudson in a minor role as Spader's supervisor-- give the only two performances in this movie that can be called emotional without cracking a smile. Spader and female lead Marisa Tomei, playing his therapist, both seem to sleepwalk through the movie.

It starts out quite unappealing but mid-way through becomes quite thrilling, but the ever-so-crucial climax is underwhelming. This is one of those movies that, ten minutes after you've seen it, you've already forgotten all about it. It's one of those movies that makes you wonder why it would be greenlit in the first place because of its complete lack of originality and wide appeal. James Spader DOES make a surprisingly good burnt out hero, and, without a doubt, he is the film's saving grace.

This killer, nicknamed 'The Watcher', methodically stalked his victims and took his time killing them, a man who obviously enjoyed his work.  Detective Campbell was obsessed with finding the killer until a special woman worked her way into his life.  Unbeknownst to the detective, the Watcher was just as obsessed with Joel as Joel was with him.  Convinced that the woman was coming between them, the Watcher made Joel's lover his next victim.  Distraught and horrified, Joel retired to Chicago and tried to bury himself in pills and sleep to keep the nightmares at bay.Bored with the new detective assigned to his case, the Watcher moved to Chicago to renew his relationship with Joel.  At first, Joel wasn't willing to play so the Watcher changed the game.  He would send a picture of his victim 24 hours before he killed her, giving Joel a fighting chance to save whomever he chose.  Unable to resist the urge to try and rescue the innocent women that the Watcher was stalking, Joel found himself too late time and time again.  Desperate, he turned to his psychologist, Dr. Polly Beilman (Marisa Tomei) for assistance, completely unaware that the Watcher was dogging his every step and watching his every move...The Watcher was a decent psychological thriller, but nothing spectacular. I found James Spader completely convincing as a burned-out detective, but there was never really any spark of life that came, even when he was working on the case. He still seemed pretty detached and cold, even during the final scenes. This should have given Keanu Reeves a chance to really steal the show, but he was just not creepy enough in his role as the serial killer. He was okay, pretty uncoordinated in his dance scenes, but just okay. I would have liked to see someone with that cold, creepy, chilly air like Anthony Hopkins or someone completely unexpected in the role as the serial killer. Also, Marisa Tomei was definitely underutilized in the film - the director should have just saved his budget and cast an unknown in the role because she played such a small part. Still, this movie did have its moments and I thought it was an entertaining enough film - entertaining enough to rent and watch once, that is.",3,"Good, But Nothing Special",1087430400,"06 17, 2004",2004,2360,"['Detective', 'Joel', 'Campbell', 'James', 'Spader', 'had', 'been', 'tracking', 'serial', 'killer', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'years', 'always', 'one', 'step', 'unable', 'catch', 'killer', 'nicknamed', 'Watcher', 'methodically', 'stalked', 'victims', 'took', 'time', 'killing', 'man', 'who', 'obviously', 'enjoyed', 'work', 'Detective', 'Campbell', 'was', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'killer', 'special', 'woman', 'worked', 'way', 'life', 'Unbeknownst', 'detective', 'Watcher', 'was', 'just', 'obsessed', 'Joel', 'Joel', 'was', 'Convinced', 'woman', 'was', 'coming', 'Watcher', 'made', 'Joel', 'lover', 'next', 'victim', 'Distraught', 'horrified', 'Joel', 'retired', 'Chicago', 'tried', 'bury', 'pills', 'sleep', 'keep', 'nightmares', 'bay.Bored', 'new', 'detective', 'assigned', 'case', 'Watcher', 'moved', 'Chicago', 'renew', 'relationship', 'Joel', 'first', 'Joel', 'was', ""n't"", 'willing', 'play', 'so', 'Watcher', 'changed', 'game', 'would', 'send', 'picture', 'victim', '24', 'hours', 'killed', 'giving', 'Joel', 'fighting', 'chance', 'save', 'whomever', 'chose', 'Unable', 'resist', 'urge', 'try', 'rescue', 'innocent', 'women', 'Watcher', 'was', 'stalking', 'Joel', 'found', 'too', 'late', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'Desperate', 'turned', 'psychologist', 'Dr.', 'Polly', 'Beilman', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'assistance', 'completely', 'unaware', 'Watcher', 'was', 'dogging', 'step', 'watching', 'move', 'Watcher', 'was', 'decent', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'found', 'James', 'Spader', 'completely', 'convincing', 'burned-out', 'detective', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'spark', 'life', 'came', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'working', 'case', 'still', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'detached', 'cold', 'even', 'final', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'Keanu', 'chance', 'really', 'steal', 'show', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'creepy', 'enough', 'role', 'serial', 'killer', 'was', 'okay', 'pretty', 'uncoordinated', 'dance', 'scenes', 'just', 'okay', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'someone', 'cold', 'creepy', 'chilly', 'air', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'someone', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'role', 'serial', 'killer', 'Also', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'was', 'definitely', 'underutilized', 'film', 'director', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'saved', 'budget', 'cast', 'unknown', 'role', 'played', 'small', 'part', 'Still', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'moments', 'thought', 'was', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'film', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'rent', 'watch', 'once']",The Watcher

The Cinematography was outstanding as well.  Some of the scenery and camera angles left me in awe.  The only hitch was the acting though.  I thought everyone, especially James Spader, did an excellent job besides Keanu Reeves.  Reeves is a good actor, don't get me wrong, it's just that this is not the role he is fit for.  He didn't drag the movie down at all, but you had to think that maybe there are others actors out there that could have done the job more eloquently.

The Watcher is another film that fits into that niche.The movie itself is typical. Just another under cooked thriller with very little meat on it's bones. Spader does manage to elevate the film with his tortured but not overdone performance. His emotional struggle seems compelling despite the relative been there done that factor of everything else about this movie.He helps make the search for the potential of Keanu Reeves stalker seem somewhat intriguing, even if we can already predict the outcome.Unfortunately he can't save this film from utter ordinariness. Keanu Reeves makes a poor villian. Even though I've always found him likable, (and a better actor that he's usually given credit for), he just hard to take him seriously in this role. The film also manages to be slightly annoying. The directors had there early experience in music videos and it shows. During any scene that's supposed to be suspensful, they overload the screen with creative and flashy cinematography. There are weird slow motion and blur effects straight out of what you might have watched on MTV the night before. All this just manages to drain any sense of dread out of the proceedings.All of this would have been a little less obvious if the ending had atleast been decent. To bad that's just not the case. Eventually the filmmakers seem like they decided to wrap things up before they actually needed to.  We are rushed to an abrupt and easy conclusion after Reeves kidnaps Marisa Tomei's pshychiatrist character. On a side note, Tomei is out of place here to, any actress could have played this nondescript and thankless role. I won't tell you what happens but suffice to say it's very little. Any strength the film had built up to that point is just neglected. Somebody at the studio must have decided production was taking to long. Or those making the film just decided they didn't care anymore. All in all, instantly forgetable.

Marshall,"[0, 2]","After viewing this movie in the theater, I walked out not really suprised because I kinda figured the movie wouldn't be that good, but I tried it because I liked Keanu in the Matrix. Well, let me tell you, his &quot;Whoa&quot; voice that he speaks in just ruined his serial killer character because he just talked too goofy and wasn't scary at all. The darkness and spookiness of the movie gave it kind of a cool tone, but without a good bad guy, it's not a good movie!",2,Keanu just didn't cut it !,978998400,"01 9, 2001",2001,469,"['viewing', 'movie', 'theater', 'walked', 'out', 'not', 'really', 'suprised', 'kinda', 'figured', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'that', 'good', 'tried', 'liked', 'Keanu', 'Matrix', 'Well', 'let', 'tell', 'quot', 'Whoa', 'quot', 'voice', 'just', 'ruined', 'serial', 'killer', 'character', 'just', 'talked', 'too', 'goofy', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'darkness', 'spookiness', 'movie', 'gave', 'kind', 'cool', 'tone', 'good', 'bad', 'guy', 'not', 'good', 'movie']",The Watcher
