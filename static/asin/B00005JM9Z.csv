Creativity was at an all-time low when they decided to make this film.  I am surprised that Levinson attached his name to this picture.  The story is weak, the characters are dull, and there is not one moment of genius to be found in this film.  I was ready for a dark comedy.  I knew that this was panned by every critic, so I thought it might be one of those rare finds that Hollywood critics hated, but those interested in film would love.  Boy, was I wrong.Where did this picture go wrong?  I would like to start at the beginning (like any good story) and just point out that if you have a character that it unfocused, you do not need to point it out for the viewers.  I understood that when Black's character continually mentioned new ideas instead of focusing on the task at hand.  I don't need a graph to point out the character flaw.  Second, what was the point of Stiller's character?  Was he a family man or was he just trying to compete with Black the whole time?  This made me think if this ""friendship"" really did exist.  Did Levinson really pull the wool over our eyes by making us think that Stiller was good friends with Black?  It is obvious throughout the picture that Black respects Stiller's friendship, but does it work both ways?  Hum, something to ponder.As the film continues, I hope that perhaps we would have secondary characters that help pick up the slack for these main characters, but, sadly, this did not happen.  Amy Poehler and Rachel Weisz couldn't have kept this film afloat if they tried.  Their moments of glory never happened, which allowed for only one good thing to come of this film (and it really isn't that great), Christopher Walken.  He is slowly moving into comedy and he is very good at it, but he should not be used to save the film.  I saw that as his sole purpose in this movie, to save the hideous jobs done by Black and Stiller.  While I will argue that scripted Stiller is better than ad-lib Stiller, he just couldn't hold himself in this film.Was it Levinson's direction or was it the story?  This is something to consider when watching this film.  My feeling was that it was the story.  There was just no heart in it.  While I did hear rumor that Larry David helped create some of the awkward moments, there was nothing powerful in this story.  This is one of the first times that I can honestly fault the story for the negative reaction to this film.  It tried for intelligent humor based around a ""bathroom"" topic.  Poehler's secondary story was absurd.  Here we have someone fighting for the environment by having rallies at waste centers and living right underneath enormous power lines.  I kept waiting for this film to be a bad dream or perhaps a reaction from the radioactive electricity that was floating above them, but it never happened.Finally, I would like to say that if you are making a movie where a mansion is needed, how about actually using a mansion instead of CGI-ing the house.  That was an immediate turn-off for me and just a quick example of the spotty production on this film.  What was Levinson thinking?  Envy was not like him, and it honestly left me with a bad taste in my mouth for anything Levinson may release next.  Where was Wag the Dog?  Where was Bandits?  It was as if he just threw out anything learned from these films and went back to filmmaking 101 for this movie.  Perhaps he had one of his children direct it and he just put his name on it ... the world may never know.Overall, the stiff performances by two good actors (Stiller and Black) immediately catapulted this film into the ""bad"" hemisphere.  There was nothing redeeming about the story, direction, or other actors that could help bring this film back down.  This was a bad movie.  From the beginning throughout the unfunny ending credits, Envy just didn't work.  I do not recommend this film to anyone unless you are looking for a good night's sleep.  It will definitely make your eyes feel heavy to watch.Grade:  * out of *****",1,Public humiliation on a grand scale...,1096675200,"10 2, 2004",2004,4078,"['Clich', 'eacute', 'clich', 'eacute', 'clich', 'eacute', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'Creativity', 'was', 'all-time', 'low', 'when', 'decided', 'make', 'film', 'am', 'surprised', 'Levinson', 'attached', 'name', 'picture', 'story', 'weak', 'characters', 'are', 'dull', 'not', 'one', 'moment', 'genius', 'be', 'found', 'film', 'was', 'ready', 'dark', 'comedy', 'knew', 'was', 'panned', 'critic', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'rare', 'Hollywood', 'critics', 'hated', 'interested', 'film', 'would', 'love', 'Boy', 'was', 'wrong.Where', 'did', 'picture', 'go', 'wrong', 'would', 'like', 'start', 'beginning', 'good', 'story', 'just', 'point', 'out', 'have', 'character', 'unfocused', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'point', 'out', 'viewers', 'understood', 'when', 'Black', 'character', 'continually', 'mentioned', 'new', 'ideas', 'instead', 'focusing', 'task', 'hand', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'graph', 'point', 'out', 'character', 'flaw', 'Second', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'Stiller', 'character', 'Was', 'family', 'man', 'was', 'just', 'trying', 'compete', 'Black', 'whole', 'time', 'made', 'think', 'friendship', 'really', 'did', 'exist', 'Did', 'Levinson', 'really', 'wool', 'eyes', 'making', 'think', 'Stiller', 'was', 'good', 'friends', 'Black', 'obvious', 'picture', 'Black', 'Stiller', 'friendship', 'work', 'ways', 'Hum', 'something', 'ponder.As', 'film', 'hope', 'perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'secondary', 'characters', 'help', 'pick', 'up', 'slack', 'main', 'characters', 'sadly', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'kept', 'film', 'afloat', 'tried', 'moments', 'glory', 'never', 'happened', 'allowed', 'only', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'come', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'slowly', 'moving', 'comedy', 'very', 'good', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'used', 'save', 'film', 'saw', 'sole', 'purpose', 'movie', 'save', 'hideous', 'jobs', 'done', 'Black', 'Stiller', 'will', 'argue', 'scripted', 'Stiller', 'better', 'ad-lib', 'Stiller', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'hold', 'film.Was', 'Levinson', 'direction', 'was', 'story', 'something', 'consider', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'feeling', 'was', 'was', 'story', 'was', 'just', 'heart', 'did', 'hear', 'rumor', 'Larry', 'David', 'helped', 'create', 'awkward', 'moments', 'was', 'nothing', 'powerful', 'story', 'one', 'first', 'times', 'can', 'honestly', 'fault', 'story', 'negative', 'reaction', 'film', 'tried', 'intelligent', 'humor', 'based', 'bathroom', 'topic', 'Poehler', 'secondary', 'story', 'was', 'absurd', 'Here', 'have', 'someone', 'fighting', 'environment', 'having', 'rallies', 'waste', 'centers', 'living', 'right', 'underneath', 'enormous', 'power', 'lines', 'kept', 'waiting', 'film', 'be', 'bad', 'dream', 'perhaps', 'reaction', 'radioactive', 'electricity', 'was', 'floating', 'never', 'happened.Finally', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'are', 'making', 'movie', 'where', 'mansion', 'needed', 'how', 'actually', 'using', 'mansion', 'instead', 'CGI-ing', 'house', 'was', 'immediate', 'turn-off', 'just', 'quick', 'example', 'spotty', 'production', 'film', 'What', 'was', 'Levinson', 'thinking', 'Envy', 'was', 'not', 'honestly', 'left', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'anything', 'Levinson', 'may', 'release', 'next', 'Where', 'was', 'Wag', 'Dog', 'Where', 'was', 'Bandits', 'was', 'just', 'threw', 'out', 'anything', 'learned', 'films', 'went', 'back', 'filmmaking', '101', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'had', 'one', 'children', 'direct', 'just', 'put', 'name', 'world', 'may', 'never', 'know.Overall', 'stiff', 'performances', 'two', 'good', 'actors', 'Stiller', 'Black', 'immediately', 'catapulted', 'film', 'bad', 'hemisphere', 'was', 'nothing', 'redeeming', 'story', 'direction', 'other', 'actors', 'could', 'help', 'bring', 'film', 'back', 'down', 'was', 'bad', 'movie', 'beginning', 'unfunny', 'ending', 'credits', 'Envy', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'night', 'sleep', 'will', 'definitely', 'make', 'eyes', 'feel', 'heavy', 'watch.Grade', '*', '*****']",Envy

His buddy ""Tim"" grows increasingly more irritated and envious, which only compounds the stress in his life, until he blows up at the boss, is promptly fired, and his wife leaves with the kids on top of it.Depressed and nearly suicidal, he enters a local bar where he meets ""The J-Man"" {Christopher Walken}, who is basically a derelict looking for a meal ticket, and takes advantage of Tim's enebriated state. After a talk amidst intoxication, he is convinced to cause some trouble and release the stress plaguing him. Unfortunately, Nick's horse becomes an unexpected victim of the venting, and is shot dead by an arrow, to which Tim buries the animal in a hole originally intended for a pool which he could not afford.The J-Man returns looking to collect on a reward posted to find the horse, which then begins the intrigue as the two trek out into the rain with the horse's corpse on the roof of a truck, misplacing it, and relocating his family for the night to J-man's backwoods childhood cabin.Along the way, Nick decides to include Tim as a full partner, and they travel the world until The J-Man feels that he should get a piece of the action, who then resorts to blackmail, but is eventually thwarted in quite an ironic manner.In the end, a surprising turn of events relating to the ingredients of the Vapoorizer, to which Nick has to start all over again with his entrepreneurship, this time with his pal Tim beside him.Jack Black's lokian personality shines through well; and the 'moral' of the story is that instead of brooding over someone else's success, use it to inspire one's own achievements.

Jack Black made me laugh out loud in such films as "" Orange County"" and The School of Rock"" and Ben Stiller was just genius with ""Zoolander. Now, you would think that ""Envy"", having two great comedy actors, would combine the laughs of ""Zoolander"" and ""The School of Rock"", but instead we got problem after problem, and only a couple of good things. ""Envy"" was postponed from last summer, and I think there was a release date set for before that, and I could understand why. It is not intolerable, but it is not really very funny. It is a dark comedy, which is something that I normally love, but this time I didn't find the darkness amusing. The film did not have anough effort put into it.The movie has Ben Stiller as Tim Dingman and Jack Black as Nick Vanderpark. The two have been friends since they were kids. Tim is a hard-worker, but Nick is always spacing out, and thinking about things. He gets a great idea in the form of a spray can that when you spray on poo, it disappers. He comes up with the name ""VaPOOrize."" Nick wants Tim to invest $2,000 in the idea, but Tim refuses, a mistake that he will soon regret. Eightteen months later, Nick and his wife Natalie are richer then everybody in town. They built a mansion across the street from Tim and his wife Debbie, and everyday Tim and Debbie have to see the big house across the street. The house that they could have had if Tim just invested money into the idea. Nick is so rich, that he has a carousal, a horse stable, and a bowling alley next to Nick's bedroom. Tim becomes green with envy, causing Debbie to leave for a while. Tim yells at his boss, gets fired, and goes to get drunk. There he meets a drifter named J-Man. The two become friends, but J-Man has to help Tim after Tim does something that could ruin the little bit of everything that he has.The biggest problem with ""Envy"" is that some of the jokes that should be funny don't work. The second problem is that you cannot sense the kind of envy that Tim is feeling, because we don't see enough of his changing. You can't relate to him, and you don't understand why he could be so mad. Jack Black was alright, but it was Amy Poehlar, who played Nick's wife, that was just awful. She wasn't funny at all.I enjoyed ""Envy"", but it wasn't something that I could see over and over again. It wasn't even worth a trip to the theatre. I am just hoping that Ben Stiller's next movie ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" is better then this.

There's very little cursing, there's NO half naked women, there's NO gang violence, there's NOT any crude humor...and so forth and so on... In fact, there's no deliberate mischievous behavior of any sort. What there is, is a story about 2 best friends, their wives(whom they're both faithful to), and their children. I was shocked while watching this movie because I don't remember one commercial about two families that are close or anything like that(not saying there weren't any, I just don't remember getting that impression about this movie). Perhaps it was bad marketing, perhaps I just wasn't paying attention, perhaps it's a little of both? Nontheless, I feel this could have easily been a great family movie if they'd just taken out a couple of the bad words and focused on the family and children a little more. By the way, the cursing is very tame compared to todays standard. I still wouldn't let my little kids watch it though.There's a great underliying story here in ENVY and I think it's a shame that no one is seeing that. If you like uplifting comedies, give it a try.

There are some interesting sight gags, like Stiller killing Jack's horse with a bow and arrow; Stiller and half-cocked Christopher Walken (who really makes the most of his role -- hey, Christopher Walken would turn Baby Bop in a ""Barney"" video into a unique role) driving around with the horse on top of Stiller's mini van; Black and his wife (played by Amy Poehler) turning their suburban ranch house into a gaudy mansion, etc.Unfortunately, this movie runs out of propellant, what with the one-note-Johnny plot. For a black (not Jack, but dark) comedy, it has an unlikely ""aw shucks"" touchy-feely ending.I can instantly think of cast and crew having done way better things in the past, every one of them. True, any movie with Rachel Weisz is quite easy on the eyes, but she doesn't have enough screen time to justify this as ""eye candy."" Plus, she was much more believable in ""Enemy At the Gates.""

The dialogue between them just cracked me up about the tasting of each others pants and ""Do you ever just watch your hand?"" Funniest parts of the whole movie. Soon thereafter, I realized the engine that was to drive the comedy in this movie was centered around making poop disappear, I knew this film was in trouble.After the age of 8 or 9 I didn't find anything about poop to be that funny anymore. Unfortunately with the screenwriter of this movie, that wasn't the case. I think the whole ""Envy"" story could've been easily driven by somthing else. There's funnier things out there than poop.As far as the acting goes, Ben Stiller and Jack Black did all they could for this movie. Their preformances were fine, so no fault on thier part(except for the fact that they agreed to do this movie). Same goes for Christopher Walken.To go along with this bad movie is a crappy (no pun intended) DVD. There's a scene index of Black's funniest moments in the movie. Who cares? I just watched it. If I really cared enough about it to see the funniest moments again, I'd torture myself by watching it again. There's also a photo gallery (we all know that's boring) and cast and crew bios. And some production notes. I would just rather them not have any special features so I don't have to waste my time.In closing, this movie is just a result of a bad and ridiculous idea.

614957,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JM9Z,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 1]","It might be a bit early to get in a verdict on 2004, simply because there are still about a third of the year's films left to come out on DVD, but I am just about ready to declare it a bad year for comedy.  In the last week I have watched ""White Chicks"" and ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" only to be disappointed, and have now topped it off with ""Envy,"" which is the worst of the bunch.  The only reason this one gets three stars is because it has Christophen Walken in it, and no matter how bad the script might be he is one actor who is going to make things interesting every moment he is on screen.The selling point for this 2004 comedy is that Nick Vanderpark (Jack Black) becomes a really rich guy because he invents ""Vapoorize.""  This is one of the greatest inventions in the history of the world because you spray it on dog poo and the dog poo disappears (ergo, ""Vapoorize"").  Nick comes up with this idea one day while he and his best friend, Tim Dingman (Ben Stiller) are commuting to work at the sandpaper factory.  Nick offers to split this great idea 50-50, but Tim cannot get past the fact that there is no explanation for how Vapoorize would work.  So he passes on the deal.Now, the whole Vapoorize idea is really just to set up the exploration of the friendship between Tim and Nick, because while Nick becomes one of the richest people on earth he continues to live across the street from his best friend.  He just happens to build his new mansion there and continues to invite Tim and his family over for food and fun.  However, Tim's wife, Debbie (Rachel Weisz) cannot get past the fact her husband has thrown away their one chance at being rich.  This explains where the film's title comes into play as the green-eyed beast consumes Tim's soul.  Meanwhile, Tim's wife, Natalie (Amy Poehler) is running for the state senate, but her campaign is being derailed by her opponent's big question: where does the poo go?Our expectation is that there will be a big payoff to this question, but there is really not much effort to do anything with the Vapoorize idea.  What really matters is that it is a farfetched idea and that if it did work it would obviously make its inventor really rich.  But then you would also expect Jack Black to be a lot funnier than he is in this film, because otherwise why would you hire him to play the part?  Stiller's character is in more familiar territory as he learns why you do not shoot an arrow into the air without any idea of where it is going to land.  Fortunately the gets to do a lot of scenes with Walken's character, the J-Man, but that is not enough to salvage this film.I actually read that ""Envy"" was intended to be a black comedy, in which case it is even worse than I thought.  There are some nice parodies of television infomercials, but none of the sharp wit I associate with a classic black comedy (e.g., ""Hospital"").  In addition to Walken's performance the only thing I find redeemable about ""Envy"" is where it ends, which I thought was a nice touch given where it starts.  It is just how you get from that first point to that last point that does not work and unfortunately that is most of the movie.",3,Yet another example of why 2004 was a bad year for comedy,1104883200,"01 5, 2005",2005,3177,"['might', 'be', 'bit', 'early', 'get', 'verdict', '2004', 'simply', 'are', 'still', 'third', 'year', 'films', 'left', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'am', 'just', 'about', 'ready', 'declare', 'bad', 'year', 'comedy', 'last', 'week', 'have', 'watched', 'White', 'Chicks', 'Anchorman', 'Legend', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'only', 'be', 'disappointed', 'have', 'now', 'topped', 'off', 'Envy', 'worst', 'bunch', 'only', 'reason', 'one', 'three', 'stars', 'Christophen', 'Walken', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'script', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'actor', 'who', 'going', 'make', 'things', 'interesting', 'moment', 'screen.The', 'selling', 'point', '2004', 'comedy', 'Nick', 'Vanderpark', 'Jack', 'Black', 'really', 'rich', 'guy', 'Vapoorize', 'one', 'greatest', 'inventions', 'history', 'world', 'spray', 'dog', 'poo', 'dog', 'poo', 'disappears', 'ergo', 'Vapoorize', 'Nick', 'up', 'idea', 'one', 'day', 'best', 'friend', 'Tim', 'Dingman', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'are', 'commuting', 'work', 'sandpaper', 'factory', 'Nick', 'split', 'great', 'idea', '50-50', 'Tim', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'fact', 'explanation', 'how', 'Vapoorize', 'would', 'work', 'deal.Now', 'whole', 'Vapoorize', 'idea', 'really', 'just', 'set', 'up', 'exploration', 'friendship', 'Tim', 'Nick', 'Nick', 'one', 'richest', 'people', 'earth', 'live', 'street', 'best', 'friend', 'just', 'build', 'new', 'mansion', 'invite', 'Tim', 'family', 'food', 'fun', 'However', 'Tim', 'wife', 'Debbie', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'fact', 'husband', 'thrown', 'away', 'one', 'chance', 'being', 'rich', 'where', 'film', 'title', 'play', 'green-eyed', 'beast', 'consumes', 'Tim', 'soul', 'Meanwhile', 'Tim', 'wife', 'Natalie', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'running', 'state', 'senate', 'campaign', 'being', 'derailed', 'opponent', 'big', 'question', 'where', 'poo', 'go', 'expectation', 'will', 'be', 'big', 'payoff', 'question', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'effort', 'do', 'anything', 'Vapoorize', 'idea', 'What', 'really', 'matters', 'farfetched', 'idea', 'did', 'work', 'would', 'obviously', 'make', 'inventor', 'really', 'rich', 'then', 'would', 'also', 'expect', 'Jack', 'Black', 'be', 'lot', 'funnier', 'film', 'otherwise', 'why', 'would', 'hire', 'play', 'part', 'Stiller', 'character', 'more', 'familiar', 'territory', 'why', 'do', 'not', 'shoot', 'arrow', 'air', 'idea', 'where', 'going', 'land', 'Fortunately', 'do', 'lot', 'scenes', 'Walken', 'character', 'J-Man', 'not', 'enough', 'salvage', 'film.I', 'actually', 'read', 'Envy', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'black', 'comedy', 'case', 'even', 'worse', 'thought', 'are', 'nice', 'parodies', 'television', 'infomercials', 'none', 'sharp', 'wit', 'associate', 'classic', 'black', 'comedy', 'e.g.', 'Hospital', 'addition', 'Walken', 'performance', 'only', 'thing', 'find', 'redeemable', 'Envy', 'where', 'thought', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'given', 'where', 'just', 'how', 'get', 'first', 'point', 'last', 'point', 'not', 'work', 'unfortunately', 'most', 'movie']",Envy

Nothing was really that funny. So I was hoping the story would at LEAST be a little interesting. Once again...nope. You could predict just about the whole movie.A short summary of the movie. Black and Stiller are best friends who work together. Black is a dreamer and Stiller is down to earth. Black has an idea that could make poop disappear. Stiller tells him to stop dreaming so much. Black actually invents the VaPOOrise with a little help and becomes extremely rich. Stiller gets envious. Black is still best friends with Stiller and buys him lots of stuff. Stiller is... envious. Stiller looses his job. Stiller then does something bad and tries to cover it up. I guess funny antics were supposed to happen after this.

There are things you may recognize by structure and delivery as jokes, but they will not make you laugh.The story involves Black and Stiller as neighbors and coworkers.  Black is constantly dreaming of weird inventions, and when one of them becomes wildly successful, Black is catapulted into great wealth.  Stiller - who had an opportunity to invest in the product and didn't - is left in his middle class existence and filled with envy.  His inability to cope with his feelings (and the lack of support from his greedy wife) leads him to snap and get in greater and greater problems.In capable hands, this could be a good movie; since the people involved were capable and the movie is horrible, you have to believe that it was deliberately made bad.

Tim (Ben) is in a higher focus position then Nick (Jack) who then Jack comes up with ideas for inventions. One day Nick comes up with an idea about a spray can, which if you spray it on dog-do it disappears. It just disappears, doesn't go anywhere, and just disappears. Tim thinks it's a stupid idea and doesn't invest. As 18 months go by Nick becomes a billionaire with his smart idea. But he doesn't want to leave his buddy Tim, so he builds a house near him. As days go buy and the jealousy just keeps crawling through Tims skin, one night he gets drunk and gets a cross bow and shoots it. But as Tim realizes he just killed his best friends horse ""Corkey"".Now it is up to Tim to try to figure out what to do with this problem. It is a must see laugh out loud comedy. Ben Stiller you would see in ""Meet the Parents"" and Jack Black you would see him in ""Saving Silverman"". For the first time ever these great comedians collide in the big screen. And they bring an obnoxious triumph! These performances are great too, my favorite is Christopher Walkins performance. He is really funny in this film. This film is one of those films where you really have to pay attention too. Just really to get the comedy in it. This is a truly must see film. You laugh hard.

Now, what happens next is Tim gets jealous of Nick's big house and his fancy food and his horse, Corky, so he goes to a bar and meets a man named J Man (Christopher Walken), who can bring light to any film he's in, but even he can't really save this flick. J Man tells him to get even somehow. So Tim gets drunk and accidently shoots Corky with a bow n arrow. Now, I think they could have made this part way funnier. Instead of it being an accident, it would have been great to see an enraged Tim purposely maybe sneaking into Nick's house and breaking stuff, or stealing, or whatever. But they made it an accident.

It's called ""Va-poo-rize,"" comes in a spray-can and makes excrement disappear (sorry, certain four letter words just do not seem to do here.) Nick suggests for his neighbor Tim (played by Ben Stiller,) who naturally is skeptical towards the idea, to provide half of 4000 dollars to make the idea reality, and split the profit of the invention 50-50. Tim ridicules the idea and turns down the offer, but the product eventually becomes a hit. Soon Nick doesn't live in the house across the street - he lives in the castle across the street, and this makes Tim envious (hence the title of the film...wink, wink, nudge, nudge.)A story this silly would work with the right director. Barry Levinston (60+ year old director of TV series such as ""Oz,"" ""The Beat,"" ""The Jury"" and of movies such as ""Toys,"" ""Rain Man"" and ""Good Morning, Vietnam"") turned a manuscript (in which the story probably appeared funnier than it does on screen) into a peculiar puppet-show. His odd and off timing, lighting, camera angles, lack of close-up shots, choice of colors, acceptance of clothing and idea of suitable music (even make-up...) is odd and unstable, as are the directional qualities of the scenes. It doesn't look like a comedy. The contrasts between certain scenes are just too heavy. There should naturally be contrast between a ""tragic"" scene of a man burying a horse until dawn (with only a shovel) and a scene where Tim has to hide ""The J-Man"" (a bum played by Christopher Walken) in the bathroom upon a surprising visit from his wife, but the burying scene looks like something dark out of a Tarkovski film, while the latter mentioned scene features music similar to the action scenes of ""Home Alone"" or some Disney film.Something that takes our minds off this weird environment, this CLOSET that the director has locked us in, is the uplifting performance of Christopher Walken who steals the scenes he plays in; the nuances of his performance (and his timing) are highly individual and on the spot - ""GOOD for you, good FOR you...""To sum up: this is a comedy with a good story and a good script. The actors performed their jobs well, and should be given more credit than they have gotten for these roles (Stiller and Black didn't just all of a sudden turn into lousy actors.)

There is definitely an uneasy feel for the movie as it seems to sting your emotions with some  deep sense of reality of what envy really is.  That is why I think I liked it because both characters portrayed their roles so well.  Envy is a two sided affair as the other person who has the things or life that you may want but do not have the guts to pursue.  The movie is funny in the sense of what envy does to Stiller's character.  Black's character never looks beyond the surface of anything and thus is oblivious to Stiller's envy.

They try to liven things with Christopher Walken as an old army guy who convinces Stiller he's everyman hero, like Che Guevara. Then when that doesn't work, Black conveniently decides to make him partner (why didn't he do this sooner?)  This sets up Rachel Weisz for a dopey transformation to greedy, sex-crazy wife.

614985,ASJ89T42CIUHU,B00005JM9Z,V. Marshall,"[1, 1]","This movie is a perfect choice if you enjoy dark comedy and nuanced pranks it will appeal to your senses, in many ways offering numerous stabs at the supposed greatness of wealth and ""the grass is always greener"" theory.Two co-workers drive to work everyday in their daily stupor each suggesting stupid ideas on how to get rich. Jack Black is toned down in his role as the man who invents a way to eliminate doggy waste and his sad side kick, played by Ben Stiller, sort of wallows in his waste. The two friends develop different personalities as they experience success and the inevitable jealousy of the left behind. Black and Stiller are great together darkly conveying the excesses of human nature to a tee. Their wives (Amy Poehler and Rachel Weisz) are just as crazy and succumb to the pull of a padded paycheck. As Black increases his wealth and fame Stiller and his family sulk in despair and desire what exists on the other side. Offering further comic relief is Christopher Walken as a conniving homeless man who befriends Stiller at one of his lowest moments.While this film isn't a laugh out loud fest it is entertaining in a subtle way. Anyone who passes a mansion and wishes for what it contains can relate to the understated stabs at the principles of the wealthy and the wake they leave in their pompous paths. Both Black and Stiller are perfect at pretending to be serious while simmering with dark laughter. The lesson found in this film is one of American excess, fast, furious and often coming from crap only to fail the system that brought it to existence in the first place. So don't be too envious when the grass grows a little greener we all need a little fertilizer now and then.",4,A Nice Green-Eyed Monster,1098403200,"10 22, 2004",2004,1704,"['movie', 'perfect', 'choice', 'enjoy', 'dark', 'comedy', 'nuanced', 'pranks', 'will', 'appeal', 'senses', 'many', 'ways', 'offering', 'numerous', 'stabs', 'supposed', 'greatness', 'wealth', 'grass', 'always', 'greener', 'theory.Two', 'co-workers', 'drive', 'work', 'everyday', 'daily', 'stupor', 'suggesting', 'stupid', 'ideas', 'how', 'get', 'rich', 'Jack', 'Black', 'toned', 'down', 'role', 'man', 'who', 'way', 'eliminate', 'doggy', 'waste', 'sad', 'side', 'kick', 'played', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'sort', 'wallows', 'waste', 'two', 'friends', 'develop', 'different', 'personalities', 'experience', 'success', 'inevitable', 'jealousy', 'left', 'behind', 'Black', 'Stiller', 'are', 'great', 'together', 'darkly', 'conveying', 'excesses', 'human', 'nature', 'tee', 'wives', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'are', 'just', 'crazy', 'succumb', 'pull', 'padded', 'paycheck', 'Black', 'wealth', 'fame', 'Stiller', 'family', 'sulk', 'despair', 'desire', 'what', 'other', 'side', 'Offering', 'further', 'comic', 'relief', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'conniving', 'homeless', 'man', 'who', 'Stiller', 'one', 'lowest', 'moments.While', 'film', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'fest', 'entertaining', 'subtle', 'way', 'Anyone', 'who', 'mansion', 'wishes', 'what', 'can', 'relate', 'understated', 'stabs', 'principles', 'wealthy', 'wake', 'leave', 'pompous', 'paths', 'Black', 'Stiller', 'are', 'perfect', 'pretending', 'be', 'serious', 'simmering', 'dark', 'laughter', 'lesson', 'found', 'film', 'one', 'American', 'excess', 'fast', 'furious', 'often', 'coming', 'crap', 'only', 'fail', 'system', 'brought', 'existence', 'first', 'place', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'envious', 'when', 'grass', 'little', 'greener', 'need', 'little', 'fertilizer', 'now', 'then']",Envy
614986,A2UVJD6OOLKEBR,B00005JM9Z,yaremar,"[1, 4]","When Robert Altman's groundbreaking M*A*S*H was released in 1970, Elliott Gould emerged as the film's breakout star. In rapid succession, Gould appeared in a flurry of truly wretched movies, and within two short years, his once-promising career was derailed. Although he has a better track record than Gould, Ben Stiller is in danger of a similar fate if he keeps appearing in disappointing efforts like ENVY.Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Jack Black) are loyal friends who work together at a sandpaper factory. When Nick comes up with the idea for a chemical spray that makes dog manure disappear into thin air, he offers Tim a chance to get in on this potential goldmine. Tim refuses, and in no time at all, the invention (dubbed ""Vapoorize"") makes Nick a billionaire. And, boy, is Tim filled with envy.Although contrived, this premise has the makings of an amusing black comedy. The problem is that the characters are presented as basically decent people: Tim is jealous, but he's more mad at himself, and still considers Nick his best friend; Nick flaunts his wealth, but he makes sure his buddy Tim is in on the good times. So the opportunity for some nasty, mean-spirited humor is squashed because no one wants to be the villain.The film also squanders its greatest asset: Christopher Walken. Unlike some of his recent, fleeting movie appearances, Walken is afforded plenty of screen time (in fact, nearly as much as Jack Black) playing an eccentric drifter known as J-Man. Walken has the great ability to take the most mundane line of dialogue and turn it into something howling funny, but there's only so much he can do with his ill-defined role. Like Stiller and Black, he's hamstrung by a script that doesn't allow him to explore the darker side of his character. But at least he has a character; Rachel Weisz and Amy Poehler (as Mrs. Dingman and Mrs. Vanderpark, respectively) barely register in their woefully underwritten roles.Fittingly, there's a subplot about a dead horse, which ENVY continually beats, literally as well as figuratively.",1,Squandered talent,1132358400,"11 19, 2005",2005,2066,"['When', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'groundbreaking', 'M*A*S*H', 'was', 'released', '1970', 'Elliott', 'Gould', 'emerged', 'film', 'breakout', 'star', 'rapid', 'succession', 'Gould', 'appeared', 'flurry', 'truly', 'wretched', 'movies', 'two', 'short', 'years', 'once-promising', 'career', 'was', 'derailed', 'better', 'track', 'record', 'Gould', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'danger', 'similar', 'fate', 'appearing', 'disappointing', 'efforts', 'ENVY.Tim', 'Dingman', 'Stiller', 'Nick', 'Vanderpark', 'Jack', 'Black', 'are', 'loyal', 'friends', 'who', 'work', 'together', 'sandpaper', 'factory', 'When', 'Nick', 'up', 'idea', 'chemical', 'spray', 'dog', 'manure', 'disappear', 'thin', 'air', 'chance', 'get', 'potential', 'goldmine', 'Tim', 'time', 'invention', 'dubbed', 'Vapoorize', 'Nick', 'billionaire', 'boy', 'Tim', 'filled', 'envy.Although', 'contrived', 'premise', 'makings', 'amusing', 'black', 'comedy', 'problem', 'characters', 'are', 'presented', 'basically', 'decent', 'people', 'Tim', 'jealous', 'more', 'mad', 'still', 'considers', 'Nick', 'best', 'friend', 'Nick', 'wealth', 'sure', 'buddy', 'Tim', 'good', 'times', 'opportunity', 'nasty', 'mean-spirited', 'humor', 'squashed', 'one', 'be', 'villain.The', 'film', 'also', 'greatest', 'asset', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'recent', 'fleeting', 'movie', 'appearances', 'Walken', 'afforded', 'plenty', 'screen', 'time', 'fact', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'Jack', 'Black', 'playing', 'eccentric', 'drifter', 'known', 'J-Man', 'Walken', 'great', 'ability', 'take', 'most', 'mundane', 'line', 'dialogue', 'turn', 'something', 'howling', 'funny', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'ill-defined', 'role', 'Stiller', 'Black', 'hamstrung', 'script', ""n't"", 'allow', 'explore', 'darker', 'side', 'character', 'least', 'character', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'Mrs.', 'Dingman', 'Mrs.', 'Vanderpark', 'respectively', 'barely', 'register', 'woefully', 'underwritten', 'roles.Fittingly', 'subplot', 'dead', 'horse', 'ENVY', 'continually', 'literally', 'as', 'well', 'figuratively']",Envy
