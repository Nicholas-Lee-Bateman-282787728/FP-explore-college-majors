1236758,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001TKNWVE,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[19, 21]","""THE NOTE"" was the #1 Rated Hallmark Channel Original Movie which stars Genie Francis and Ted McGinley as Peyton and King return again with the the sequel, ""The Note II: Taking a Chance on Love"".VIDEO & AUDIO:""The Note II: Taking a Chance on Love"" is a cable movie that is featured in anamorphic widescreen (1:85:1 aspect ratio) and featured in English 5.1 (Dolby Digital).  Whereas the last film featured Peyton everywhere and ths more location shots, you still get a good amount of outdoor shots between her and King but also within the storyline of Eve Miller and her friends.As for the audio, it is Dolby Digital and because the film is dialogue driven, it's front channel heavy but dialogue is clear and concise.  Not much use of rear channel or  subwoofer audio but there is no need for it.SPECIAL FEATURES:The following special features are included on the DVD:* Heart Healers: Genie Francis and Ted McGinley - (4:52) Interviews with Genie Francis and Ted McGinley about the sequel and having to work together again, talking about their characters and taking a chance on love.* Mother & Daughter - (4:12) Interviews with Genie Francis and Katie Boland about their characters and the relationship between Peyton and Christine.* How It all Began: Notes on ""The Note"" - (4:02) A summarized version of ""The Note"" into four minutes.JUDGMENT CALL:""The Note II: Taking a Chance on Love"" was another heartwarming film and for those who enjoyed the first film, it was pretty enjoyable to see the characters reunite again.As mentioned with my review of the first film, it was great to see actress Genie Francis again in a romantic role that is not ""General Hospital"" and also to see Ted McGinley in a non-comedic role which he has played in for shows like ""Happy Days"", ""Married with Children"" and ""Hope & Faith"".  Both have good chemistry and the storyline elevated their relationship for the viewer and overall, it was a well-told story.As for the 2009 sequel, I feel as if ""The Note II"" was more of a televised film, whereas the first felt as if it had a bigger budget and higher production quality, I suppose you can notice the difference in film quality and of course, overall location shots.  But bare in mind that the first film is based on a novel by Angela Hunt and had a feeling of a spiritual, holiday film. The sequel is written and directed by TV actor/director Douglas Barr (""The Fall Guy"", ""The Love Boat"", ""Designing Women"") who designed the first film but again, the original was very strong on locations.But by no means am I saying the sequel is a  slouch because its not.  It's hard enough for a sequel to be just as great or better than its first but ""The Note II"" was an enjoyable film.Where the first film was just emotional as it revolved around people who lost love ones from a tragic airline crash and finding love at the end, ""The Note II"" as much as it was a story about Peyton and King's relationship, the story revolving around the character of Eve Williams was just heartwarming and the overall theme is ""taking a chance on love"".Now, as far as the DVD is concerned, the first DVD had two lengthy featurettes with Angela Hunt and the other with Genie Francis about her career and playing Peyton.  This time around, we get two short features and one summarized video clip of the first film.  It would have been great to have a director and talent commentary included with ""The Note II"" DVD.Overall, for fans who enjoyed the first film of ""The Note"", the first was a nice nod to those who enjoyed the characters.  Granted, this is not based on any novel by Angela Hunt but I can easily recommend this film to those who were fans of the first.  Definitely check it out!",4,It's hard to create a sequel when the first film was very good but overall the sequel was quite enjoyable and heartwarming!,1241568000,"05 6, 2009",2009,3693,"['NOTE', 'was', '1', 'Rated', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'Original', 'Movie', 'Genie', 'Francis', 'Ted', 'McGinley', 'Peyton', 'King', 'return', 'again', 'sequel', 'Note', 'II', 'Taking', 'Chance', 'Love', '.VIDEO', 'AUDIO', 'Note', 'II', 'Taking', 'Chance', 'Love', 'cable', 'movie', 'featured', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', '1:85:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'featured', 'English', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'last', 'film', 'featured', 'Peyton', 'everywhere', 'ths', 'more', 'location', 'shots', 'still', 'get', 'good', 'amount', 'outdoor', 'shots', 'King', 'also', 'storyline', 'Eve', 'Miller', 'friends.As', 'audio', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'film', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'front', 'channel', 'heavy', 'dialogue', 'clear', 'concise', 'Not', 'much', 'use', 'rear', 'channel', 'subwoofer', 'audio', 'need', 'it.SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', 'following', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'included', 'DVD', '*', 'Heart', 'Healers', 'Genie', 'Francis', 'Ted', 'McGinley', '4:52', 'Interviews', 'Genie', 'Francis', 'Ted', 'McGinley', 'sequel', 'having', 'work', 'together', 'again', 'talking', 'characters', 'taking', 'chance', 'love', '*', 'Mother', 'Daughter', '4:12', 'Interviews', 'Genie', 'Francis', 'Katie', 'Boland', 'characters', 'relationship', 'Peyton', 'Christine', '*', 'How', 'Began', 'Notes', 'Note', '4:02', 'summarized', 'version', 'Note', 'four', 'minutes.JUDGMENT', 'CALL', 'Note', 'II', 'Taking', 'Chance', 'Love', 'was', 'heartwarming', 'film', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'see', 'characters', 'reunite', 'again.As', 'mentioned', 'review', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'actress', 'Genie', 'Francis', 'again', 'romantic', 'role', 'not', 'General', 'Hospital', 'also', 'see', 'Ted', 'McGinley', 'non-comedic', 'role', 'played', 'shows', 'Happy', 'Days', 'Married', 'Children', 'Hope', 'Faith', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'storyline', 'elevated', 'relationship', 'viewer', 'overall', 'was', 'well-told', 'story.As', '2009', 'sequel', 'feel', 'Note', 'II', 'was', 'more', 'televised', 'film', 'first', 'felt', 'had', 'bigger', 'budget', 'higher', 'production', 'quality', 'suppose', 'can', 'notice', 'difference', 'film', 'quality', 'course', 'overall', 'location', 'shots', 'bare', 'mind', 'first', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'Angela', 'Hunt', 'had', 'feeling', 'spiritual', 'holiday', 'film', 'sequel', 'written', 'directed', 'TV', 'actor/director', 'Douglas', 'Barr', 'Fall', 'Guy', 'Love', 'Boat', 'Designing', 'Women', 'who', 'designed', 'first', 'film', 'again', 'original', 'was', 'very', 'strong', 'locations.But', 'means', 'am', 'saying', 'sequel', 'slouch', 'not', 'hard', 'enough', 'sequel', 'be', 'just', 'great', 'better', 'first', 'Note', 'II', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'film.Where', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'emotional', 'revolved', 'people', 'who', 'lost', 'love', 'ones', 'tragic', 'airline', 'crash', 'finding', 'love', 'end', 'Note', 'II', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'story', 'Peyton', 'King', 'relationship', 'story', 'revolving', 'character', 'Eve', 'Williams', 'was', 'just', 'heartwarming', 'overall', 'theme', 'taking', 'chance', 'love', '.Now', 'as', 'far', 'DVD', 'concerned', 'first', 'DVD', 'had', 'two', 'lengthy', 'featurettes', 'Angela', 'Hunt', 'other', 'Genie', 'Francis', 'career', 'playing', 'Peyton', 'time', 'around', 'get', 'two', 'short', 'features', 'one', 'summarized', 'video', 'clip', 'first', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'have', 'director', 'talent', 'commentary', 'included', 'Note', 'II', 'DVD.Overall', 'fans', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'film', 'Note', 'first', 'was', 'nice', 'nod', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'characters', 'Granted', 'not', 'based', 'novel', 'Angela', 'Hunt', 'can', 'easily', 'recommend', 'film', 'who', 'were', 'fans', 'first', 'Definitely', 'check', 'out']",The Note II: Taking a Chance on Love
