959537,A1L0W5MGW0TKWV,B000CNGBVM,"C. Logan ""Missy""","[0, 0]","In season three of Degrassi: The Next Generation, several of the characters go through some pretty significant changes. As identity becomes a major theme this season, many of the characters go through interesting developments. Some mature and others change for the worse.Manny changes her physical appearance, which consequently alters her personality as well--causing her to make some careless and irresponsible choices. Marco is finally forced to come out to all his friends about his sexuality. And Spinner, who considered himself one of Marco's closest friends, lashes out when he finds out the truth about his friend.In addition, we get lots of new romances and relationships this season, including an important love triangle that becomes a major part of season three. The issues are multiplied this season. If you thought season two was drama heavy, season three deals with even more difficult subject matter, which include: homophobia, teen pregnancy, abortion, relationship abuse, and cutting. All of the characters go through major changes this season, as they continue to grow and develop into young adults.The show is currently entering its eighth season, and yet I still consider season three to be one of the show's best seasons to date. The characters are still growing up and clearly have a lot to learn, and the issues they deal with become more challenging. And yet the show doesn't go overboard with drama, like it does in some of the later seasons. Degrassi is still real and relatable in season three, and the entertainment value is some of the best the show's ever seen.",5,A Season of Change,1216857600,"07 24, 2008",2008,1591,"['season', 'three', 'Degrassi', 'Next', 'Generation', 'several', 'characters', 'go', 'pretty', 'significant', 'changes', 'identity', 'major', 'theme', 'season', 'many', 'characters', 'go', 'interesting', 'developments', 'mature', 'others', 'change', 'worse.Manny', 'physical', 'appearance', 'consequently', 'personality', 'as', 'well', 'causing', 'make', 'careless', 'irresponsible', 'choices', 'Marco', 'finally', 'forced', 'come', 'out', 'friends', 'sexuality', 'Spinner', 'who', 'considered', 'one', 'Marco', 'closest', 'friends', 'lashes', 'out', 'when', 'out', 'truth', 'friend.In', 'addition', 'get', 'lots', 'new', 'romances', 'relationships', 'season', 'including', 'important', 'love', 'triangle', 'major', 'part', 'season', 'three', 'issues', 'are', 'multiplied', 'season', 'thought', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'drama', 'heavy', 'season', 'three', 'deals', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'subject', 'matter', 'include', 'homophobia', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'abortion', 'relationship', 'abuse', 'cutting', 'characters', 'go', 'major', 'changes', 'season', 'continue', 'grow', 'develop', 'young', 'adults.The', 'show', 'currently', 'entering', 'eighth', 'season', 'yet', 'still', 'consider', 'season', 'three', 'be', 'one', 'show', 'best', 'seasons', 'date', 'characters', 'are', 'still', 'growing', 'up', 'clearly', 'have', 'lot', 'learn', 'issues', 'deal', 'become', 'more', 'challenging', 'yet', 'show', ""n't"", 'go', 'overboard', 'drama', 'later', 'seasons', 'Degrassi', 'still', 'real', 'relatable', 'season', 'three', 'entertainment', 'value', 'best', 'show', 'ever', 'seen']","Degrassi: The Next Generation, Season 3"
959538,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000CNGBVM,Dorrie Wheeler,"[43, 44]","The third season of the popular teen drama Degrassi The Next Generation is now available on DVD. The three disc box set features all twenty two episodes from the shows third season--including the two part episode ""Accidents Will Happen."" This episode did not air in the United States on The-N, the network which airs Degrassi The Next Generation.Now that the shows fifth season episodes are airing, season three seems like it was a really long time ago. It was before the school shooting and Jimmy's paralysis, and light years before Jay & Silent Bob decided to pay a visit to Degrassi Community School.At the beginning of season three Emma's mom was preparing to give birth to baby Jack. This new addition to the family and Emma's home life with Mr. Simpson now as her step-father sent Emma on a mission to find her birth father Shane. Emma finds her father and he isn't exactly in the greatest shape. Season three definitely started with a bang.Whereas the new character Craig Manning was very integral to the season 2 storylines, Craig had to share the spotlight with several other characters who had major stories during the shows third season. Season three was the season in which Marco came out to his friends regarding his homosexuality. Of all of Marco's friends Spinner had the biggest problem with Marco's revelation but the two would overcome this obstacle.Another important season three storyline would be the volatile relationship between Terri and Rick. Their story would end with violent consequences.Interracial relationships are nothing new to Degrassi The Next Generation (Craig & Manny, Ashley and Jimmy), yet it appeared the show was about to embark on another interracial relationship between Emma and Chris. Well perhaps the writers decided to go in another direction because although it once seemed like Chris would be an important character on the show he soon faded into the background.Probably the most talked about episode from season three is ""Accidents Will Happen."" This is the two part episode that didn't air in the states. The reason why? Most likely because this episode deals with that hot button topic of abortion. In this episode young Manny finds herself sick and throwing up quite often. What is initially thought to be a cold or virus turns out to be an unplanned pregnancy. Manny turns to Emma's mom Spike for guidance. Spike became pregnant at the age of 14 and soon after gave birth to Emma. Spike is a comforting ear for Manny. I don't want to spoil things too much for people who have never seen the episode but it's very well written. It's a well known fact that Emma (Manny's best friend) is strongly against abortion (remember she flipped when her mom considered having an abortion when she became pregnant with Jack before the wedding?) Craig wants to keep the baby, Manny initially isn't sure what she wants. It's a great episode and one of the best Degrassi The Next Generation episodes ever because watching the episode you will truly empathize with every characters point of view when it comes to this controversial topic. Outside of the unplanned pregnancy, there are some other important scenes in these episodes. We see Manny apologize to Ashley for being involved with Craig while they were dating. ""Accidents Will Happen"" part two also features the clip of Liberty dressed in leather trying to pick up Sean. The-N shows this clip quite often in promo's but fans of the show have been left wondering when this happened, mystery solved.Overall, season 3 was a really great season. For the most part the adult storylines took a back seat to the kids this season but there were several on-going stories including Mr. Simpson's cancer and the ongoing love affair between Joey Jeremiah and Caitlin Ryan.Funimation once again did a great job with the DVD box set. The box and inner casing design is similar to the previous season box set. As expected you can count on cool extras.

959543,AOU1I52M83CLV,B000CNGBVM,Jonathan Clark,"[6, 6]","It is pretty difficult to describe the television show 'Degrassi: The Next Generation' in just a few sentences, you have to experience it yourself. On the outside it is you're typical teen soap opera/drama in the tradtion of such favorites as 'Dawson's Creek' and 'The O.C.' But what makes Degrassi a higher quality show than those others is the heart, tenderness, and believability that the show provides to it's audience.At its center 'Degrassi' has a cast of extremely gifted young actors who don't play their characters as the sterotypical jocks, geeks, etc. that one sees in other shows. Though many of the characters have roles that would only require that amount of energy to make them sterotypical they go above and beyond to create realistic people that resemble not the James Van Der Beeks or Adam Brodys that we see in other shows, but real live people who we grew up with in high school. The writing and direction of the show is of an excellent caliber and continues again and again to surprise with the increasing quality of each passing episode.In the thrid season of the show (in my opinion the best season) plots that began back in season two emerge into greater importance and the students of Degrassi Community School must deal with crises that mimic almost exactly what every high school in the world at one point or another has to go through.The bottom line is that 'Degrassi: The Next Generation' is an outstanding show and one that no one can watch without feeling affected. Though some may think because this is the newest series in a long line of popular shows in the eighties and ninties (and some may think that it couldn't be as good as the originals) one should watch it and see for themselves the quality of the show is equal (and in some cases better) than the original 'Degrassi.'",5,Degrassi,1140566400,"02 22, 2006",2006,1811,"['pretty', 'difficult', 'describe', 'television', 'show', 'Next', 'Generation', 'just', 'few', 'sentences', 'have', 'experience', 'outside', ""'re"", 'typical', 'teen', 'soap', 'opera/drama', 'tradtion', 'such', 'favorites', ""'Dawson"", 'Creek', 'O.C', 'what', 'Degrassi', 'higher', 'quality', 'show', 'others', 'heart', 'tenderness', 'believability', 'show', 'center', ""'Degrassi"", 'cast', 'extremely', 'gifted', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'characters', 'sterotypical', 'jocks', 'geeks', 'etc', 'one', 'sees', 'other', 'shows', 'many', 'characters', 'have', 'roles', 'would', 'only', 'require', 'amount', 'energy', 'make', 'sterotypical', 'go', 'create', 'realistic', 'people', 'resemble', 'not', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beeks', 'Adam', 'Brodys', 'see', 'other', 'shows', 'real', 'live', 'people', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'high', 'school', 'writing', 'direction', 'show', 'excellent', 'caliber', 'again', 'again', 'surprise', 'increasing', 'quality', 'passing', 'thrid', 'season', 'show', 'opinion', 'best', 'season', 'plots', 'began', 'back', 'season', 'two', 'emerge', 'greater', 'importance', 'students', 'Degrassi', 'Community', 'School', 'must', 'deal', 'crises', 'mimic', 'almost', 'exactly', 'what', 'high', 'school', 'world', 'one', 'point', 'go', 'through.The', 'bottom', 'line', ""'Degrassi"", 'Next', 'Generation', 'outstanding', 'show', 'one', 'one', 'can', 'watch', 'feeling', 'affected', 'may', 'think', 'newest', 'series', 'long', 'line', 'popular', 'shows', 'eighties', 'ninties', 'may', 'think', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'good', 'originals', 'one', 'should', 'watch', 'see', 'quality', 'show', 'equal', 'cases', 'better', 'original', ""'Degrassi""]","Degrassi: The Next Generation, Season 3"

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[0, 0]","When Drake first came out, all I kept hearing was ""The dude from Degrassi is rapping,"" but I'd never heard of or seen this show (or the original version). I'm kinda glad I didn't because it might've been harder for me to separate the character from the rapper (specifically from that make-me-lunch awful rap), and I'm a huge fan of the rapper. From the first two seasons, I thought Drake's character was a little corny, but on this particular season, he got some swagger (and a much-needed haircut). He's my favorite character.But on a great note, I'm glad he did crossover because otherwise I may have never known about the show, and I love it. I get into these school/teenage shows: ""The Wonder Years - Complete Series (Seasons 1-6) (Import),"" ""A Different World - Season 1,"" ""Saved by the Bell - Seasons 1 & 2,"" ""My So-Called Life: The Complete Series (w/Book),"" ""Beverly Hills, 90210 - The Complete First Season"" and ""90210: The Complete First Season,"" the short-lived Showtime shows ""Chris Cross"" and ""Ready or Not"" and so on. But this show has something that the others don't. They give some of these teenagers the old spirits that are usually reserved for adults and ""Peanuts"" characters. While some teenage shows cover more G-rated happy topics, this show is covering topics like cutting, teenage pregnancy, cancer, homosexuality, stealing property, getting caught for detention for watching ""adult material"" online, domestic abuse, etc. Sure, we see fun-loving topics like teenage crushes, who's cheating, driver's education, skipping school, sports, bullying and being a nerd. This show is just the perfect mix.What I REALLY like about it is the same reason I seriously considered moving to Canada. The characters on this show who you think would be cast as certain types are instead cast as others. Yes, we have the beautiful blonde, but there's also an equally beautiful sista. Yes, we have the heavyset girl, but she's with the ""cool"" kids instead of the ""outcast"" crew. Even the cool kids are hanging with the ""nerd"" bunch for various reasons. There's a perfect mix of children instead of the ""token"" character who sticks his/her head in just to meet the diversity quota. While visiting Canada, I also got the impression diversity was embraced far more there than in America.Although I want to strangle Emma on every single episode (she is over-the-top nosey, meddlesome, and more of a goody goody than any other teenage show I've ever seen), every blue moon she comes in handy. The only thing I can say that I don't care for in the show is I'm not at all interested in the adults. Emma's mother's backstory is boring to me, but she came in handy during the teenage pregnancy episode. The teacher is all right, but I don't really care that he's dating Emma's mother. I do like Craig's guardian and Sean's older brother because they come up when it's significant for the kids. However, I shrugged through the Christmas episode, and I thought Craig's guardian was dead wrong for his final decision. Angie's such a brat, by the way, and Liberty kinda is, too, but in an adorable way.

You had a few new characters in this season, Alex, Jay, and Rick. Also the last season with Terri. The only complaint I have is that the storylines seem to lack the intensity they had last season but they weren't bad or anything. The storyline I didn't care for was the whole Craig-Ashley-Manny love/drama triangle, after the great storylines Craig had last season and Jake Epstein's great performance I just couldn't bring myself to care about this one.

If there's one season to have on DVD it's this one. Anything after season 3 is garbage in my opinion and anything before it just doesn't measure up. Seasons 4 and 5, when they do come out on DVD, are not worth the money because there just not as good. If someone were to ask me why i liked Degrassi or what made it such a kickass show, all I would have to do is give them this dvd.

It sort of feels like the male producers decideded it would be cool to see all of the young actresses in leotards, matronly leotards at that.  I felt it was iky!!! All of the actresses are beautiful with beautiful bodies but I don't understand the point of having a gymastics team materialize out of the blue.  The obvious cuts between real gymnists and the actresses was just plain cheesy!!!  I guess I was expecting more out of the two missing episodes.  I have a new low found respect for Ashley because of the way she announced to the entire school cafeteria the pregnancy of Many & Craig.  I also felt that there may have been some doubt as to who the father is because Manny was chummy with Sulley also remember....Hazel's line ""I just did a back walkover that belonged in a horror movie"" is pretty hilirious & disgusting.",5,Finally Accidents Will Happen,1143676800,"03 30, 2006",2006,916,"['LOVE', 'Degrassi', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'bit', 'strange', 'two', 'missing', 'episodes', 'sort', 'feels', 'male', 'producers', 'decideded', 'would', 'be', 'cool', 'see', 'young', 'actresses', 'leotards', 'matronly', 'leotards', 'felt', 'was', 'iky', 'actresses', 'are', 'beautiful', 'beautiful', 'bodies', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'point', 'having', 'gymastics', 'team', 'materialize', 'blue', 'obvious', 'cuts', 'real', 'gymnists', 'actresses', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'cheesy', 'guess', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'two', 'missing', 'episodes', 'have', 'new', 'low', 'found', 'respect', 'Ashley', 'way', 'announced', 'entire', 'school', 'cafeteria', 'pregnancy', 'Many', 'Craig', 'also', 'felt', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'doubt', 'who', 'father', 'Manny', 'was', 'chummy', 'Sulley', 'also', 'remember', '.Hazel', 'line', 'just', 'did', 'back', 'walkover', 'belonged', 'horror', 'movie', 'pretty', 'hilirious', 'disgusting']","Degrassi: The Next Generation, Season 3"
