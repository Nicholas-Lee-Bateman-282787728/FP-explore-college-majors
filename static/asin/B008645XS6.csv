""Fat Loser""","[2, 8]","As a movie, this could have been the foreign equivalent of a Lifetime Channel melodrama of the week, minus the graphic molestation scenes.  Thus I give it 3 stars.  As a true story, this film is a chilling reminder of how barren and desolate our humanity is. More and more it makes you realize the ugly true nature of mankind. We are only barely kept in check by laws, that hardly work to keep us from being what we really are: a mob of uncivilized, brutal savages.  I can't believe that this is a true story! But sadly, it is. Are human beings really capable of such foul, craven, grossly monstrous behavior as this?  Well you only have to look at incidents like this to know the truth, YES WE ARE! Remember the priest who molested all those deaf children in Europe? And what was his punishment? Nothing! He was buried with full Catholic honors.  Its bad enough to hear of individuals committing crimes against children but a whole institution? And everybody turning a blind eye! Its just vile! Nobody wants to accept the reality that human beings are just animals. We are only motivated by our basal needs: food and sex. We create religion to pretend we are somehow more then just another creature on Earth. And how is it in these ""holy"" institutions like the Catholic churches and the school for the deaf shown in this film, that nothing protected these children? Not the employees of the school, not the social workers, not the administrators, not the governing bodies and not any ""celestial being"" that we bow down and worship every Sunday. HUMANS ARE GARBAGE!  This is why I home school, work at home and never leave the house.

1547118,AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B008645XS6,"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com""","[12, 12]","Silenced (aka The Crucible) is a drama based on real events. In-Ho is a new teacher at a school for the hearing impaired. He immediately notices his students are acting strange. He then finds out that they have been physically and sexually abused by their teachers and even the principal. The students' vivid stories are told and brought to court. This is an amazing film.First, I have to mention, this movie has a lot of violence towards children- both physically and sexually. It gets very hard to watch as you hear the agonizing screams of the children. The kids tell their stories in sign-language and its interpreted by their teacher, In-Ho. You hear and see the stories of three students (one tells a sad story that involves his brother). I think the story involving Mr. Park was the most disturbing because of how detailed and evil it was; I don't want to spoil the movie, but he was a really sick man for doing what he did to those boys in the bathroom. The rest are still disturbing, though. And, although they're told in sign-language, you can still see their pain through their tears and facial expressions as they tell their stories. The children did an amazing job in this film, some of the best acting I've seen from kids. As I previously stated, the stories are extremely detailed and include very young kids. This will probably make you hate the offenders because they did a perfect job playing these sinister characters.That leads to my other point; this film will take you on an emotional ride. There are some moments that will make you smile, some will make you angry, some will make you sad, etc. It's a very powerful and effective film. And it has a strong message. The ending was also amazing. Like most foreign films, it doesn't follow the generic Hollywood formula.Silenced has beautiful direction, brilliant acting, a powerful, well-told storyline and amazing music (I got a ""Memories of Murder""-vibe from the music). It's often a hard movie to watch, but its a story that must be told and heard. One of my favorite films from South Korea. As of 8/4/12, Silenced is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is also highly recommended.This film has violence and blood involving children, and strong sex/nudity involving children.",5,A Sad And Powerful Drama,1344038400,"08 4, 2012",2012,2259,"['Silenced', 'Crucible', 'drama', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'In-Ho', 'new', 'teacher', 'school', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'immediately', 'students', 'are', 'acting', 'strange', 'then', 'out', 'have', 'been', 'physically', 'sexually', 'abused', 'teachers', 'even', 'principal', 'students', 'vivid', 'stories', 'are', 'told', 'brought', 'court', 'amazing', 'film.First', 'have', 'mention', 'movie', 'lot', 'violence', 'towards', 'children-', 'physically', 'sexually', 'very', 'hard', 'watch', 'hear', 'agonizing', 'screams', 'children', 'kids', 'tell', 'stories', 'sign-language', 'interpreted', 'teacher', 'In-Ho', 'hear', 'see', 'stories', 'three', 'students', 'one', 'sad', 'story', 'brother', 'think', 'story', 'involving', 'Mr.', 'Park', 'was', 'most', 'disturbing', 'how', 'detailed', 'evil', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'sick', 'man', 'doing', 'what', 'did', 'boys', 'bathroom', 'rest', 'are', 'still', 'disturbing', 'though', ""'re"", 'told', 'sign-language', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'pain', 'tears', 'facial', 'expressions', 'tell', 'stories', 'children', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'film', 'best', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'kids', 'previously', 'stated', 'stories', 'are', 'extremely', 'detailed', 'include', 'very', 'young', 'kids', 'will', 'probably', 'make', 'hate', 'offenders', 'did', 'perfect', 'job', 'playing', 'sinister', 'characters.That', 'other', 'point', 'film', 'will', 'take', 'emotional', 'ride', 'are', 'moments', 'will', 'make', 'smile', 'will', 'make', 'angry', 'will', 'make', 'sad', 'etc', 'very', 'powerful', 'effective', 'film', 'strong', 'message', 'ending', 'was', 'also', 'amazing', 'most', 'foreign', 'films', ""n't"", 'follow', 'generic', 'Hollywood', 'formula.Silenced', 'beautiful', 'direction', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'powerful', 'well-told', 'storyline', 'amazing', 'music', 'got', 'Memories', 'Murder', '-vibe', 'music', 'often', 'hard', 'movie', 'watch', 'story', 'must', 'be', 'told', 'heard', 'One', 'favorite', 'films', 'South', 'Korea', '8/4/12', 'Silenced', 'available', 'Netflix', 'Streaming', 'purchase', 'also', 'highly', 'recommended.This', 'film', 'violence', 'blood', 'involving', 'children', 'strong', 'sex/nudity', 'involving', 'children']",N/A
1547119,A3ODKKGVALLI2G,B008645XS6,Keris Nine,"[2, 3]","Based on a real-life case of child abuse at a home for deaf children in a South Korean small town, Silenced obviously deals with sensitive and harrowing material, but its stance is a curious one.  On the one hand, it necessarily has to make the subject accessible for a wide audience which weakens the realism to some extent, but on the other hand, it director/writer Hwang Don-hyuk's position on the legal ruling is less ambivalent than that of the Korean courts, siding wholeheartedly behind the innocent children who were abused at the school and, quite frankly, depicting the trial of the accused as being a complete cover-up where their lenient sentences were bought by a corrupt legal system.It doesn't take too long for new Art teacher In-ho to realise that not everything is above board in Ja-ae Academy for the deaf in the small country town of Mujin.  A young boy has recently died on the railway tracks and there's an air of corruption at the school, with the new teacher being asked to make a sizeable ""donation"" for his placement, and their being evidence that the governor's has a close relationship and makes payments to the local police force.  There is something more sinister however about the cries of the deaf children that he hears in the night and the severe punishments and beatings that he sees several of the children subjected to.  He is told that the children are mentally impaired, but they seem frightened and it soon becomes clear that they are being sexually abused also.  No-one however seems to be willing to accept this until an interview with one of the children is broadcast on a television channel.One would think that such activities might prejudice the eventual court trial, but the amount of behind the scenes deals, bribes and favours being shown give the impression of a corrupt and self-serving justice system that operates to very different rules than those we are familiar with, particularly in how young underage deaf children are treated in open-court cross examinations.  The politicisation of the trial, the prejudice against the deaf people, the religious involvement in the case and the eventual outcome is almost as shocking as the events that take place at the school.Despite the power of the subject, director Hwang Don-hyuk doesn't seem to be able to trust the events to speak for themselves.  Unable perhaps to be grittily realistic - understandably considering that it is aimed at a mass market public - the film is however over-dramatised in a bland, conventional way, using manipulative imagery, unnecessarily stirring the emotions by making the kids extra-cute and showing the villains as sneeringly evil.  There's no need for this - the horror of what has occurred speaks for itself, and by making such good/evil divisions it avoids asking the difficult questions about how this could have been allowed to happen or what the subsequent attitudes displayed say about Korean society.  On the other hand it's just as important to raise the profile of this case to as wide an audience as possible, and the film's commercial success and winning of many awards to some extent justifies the approach.",4,Speaking out,1372550400,"06 30, 2013",2013,3154,"['Based', 'real-life', 'case', 'child', 'abuse', 'home', 'deaf', 'children', 'South', 'Korean', 'small', 'town', 'Silenced', 'obviously', 'sensitive', 'harrowing', 'material', 'stance', 'curious', 'one', 'one', 'hand', 'necessarily', 'make', 'subject', 'accessible', 'wide', 'audience', 'realism', 'extent', 'other', 'hand', 'director/writer', 'Hwang', 'Don-hyuk', 'position', 'legal', 'ruling', 'less', 'ambivalent', 'Korean', 'courts', 'siding', 'wholeheartedly', 'innocent', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'abused', 'school', 'quite', 'frankly', 'depicting', 'trial', 'accused', 'being', 'complete', 'cover-up', 'where', 'lenient', 'sentences', 'were', 'bought', 'corrupt', 'legal', 'system.It', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'long', 'new', 'Art', 'teacher', 'In-ho', 'realise', 'not', 'everything', 'board', 'Ja-ae', 'Academy', 'deaf', 'small', 'country', 'town', 'Mujin', 'A', 'young', 'boy', 'recently', 'died', 'railway', 'tracks', 'air', 'corruption', 'school', 'new', 'teacher', 'being', 'asked', 'make', 'sizeable', 'donation', 'placement', 'being', 'evidence', 'governor', 'close', 'relationship', 'payments', 'local', 'police', 'force', 'something', 'more', 'sinister', 'however', 'cries', 'deaf', 'children', 'night', 'severe', 'punishments', 'beatings', 'several', 'children', 'subjected', 'told', 'children', 'are', 'mentally', 'impaired', 'seem', 'frightened', 'soon', 'clear', 'are', 'being', 'sexually', 'abused', 'also', 'No-one', 'however', 'be', 'willing', 'accept', 'interview', 'one', 'children', 'broadcast', 'television', 'channel.One', 'would', 'think', 'such', 'activities', 'might', 'prejudice', 'eventual', 'court', 'trial', 'amount', 'scenes', 'deals', 'bribes', 'favours', 'being', 'shown', 'give', 'impression', 'corrupt', 'self-serving', 'justice', 'system', 'very', 'different', 'rules', 'are', 'familiar', 'particularly', 'how', 'young', 'underage', 'deaf', 'children', 'are', 'treated', 'open-court', 'cross', 'examinations', 'politicisation', 'trial', 'prejudice', 'deaf', 'people', 'religious', 'involvement', 'case', 'eventual', 'outcome', 'almost', 'as', 'shocking', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'school.Despite', 'power', 'subject', 'director', 'Hwang', 'Don-hyuk', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'trust', 'events', 'speak', 'Unable', 'perhaps', 'be', 'grittily', 'realistic', 'understandably', 'considering', 'aimed', 'mass', 'market', 'public', 'film', 'however', 'over-dramatised', 'bland', 'conventional', 'way', 'using', 'manipulative', 'imagery', 'unnecessarily', 'stirring', 'emotions', 'making', 'kids', 'extra-cute', 'showing', 'villains', 'sneeringly', 'evil', 'need', 'horror', 'what', 'occurred', 'speaks', 'making', 'such', 'good/evil', 'divisions', 'asking', 'difficult', 'questions', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'happen', 'what', 'subsequent', 'attitudes', 'displayed', 'say', 'Korean', 'society', 'other', 'hand', 'just', 'as', 'important', 'raise', 'profile', 'case', 'wide', 'audience', 'possible', 'film', 'commercial', 'success', 'winning', 'many', 'awards', 'extent', 'approach']",N/A

It is an extremely difficult film to watch.  (Five stars for excellence - but I did not love this movie.)It is very violent, and contains nudity and recreated, very graphic scenes of adult males beating and raping deaf girls and boys, and of a woman putting a girl in a washing machine.  This is true horror.The film (and book) exposed the child abuse, rape and cover up at a school for the deaf in Korea.  Immoral people lied and covered up the horrific crimes to keep their jobs and or to get better jobs and hush money.  The church and the government and the legal systems, corrupt courts, prosecutors and judges, and corrupt police, and even the people of the city who did not want to admit the horrible truth failed to protect defenseless children  Society and the systems that are supposed to protect children failed to protect the children.Incredible acting!  Gong Yoo (Coffee Prince, etc.) is great as always.  His character and two female characters are not bought off with bribes or threats.
