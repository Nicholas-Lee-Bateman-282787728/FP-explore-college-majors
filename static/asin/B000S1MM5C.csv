I'm particularly pleased to get to see his early HBO shows; as Robert said on Jay Leno, in those days HBO had fewer than a half million subscribers, so these are rare films indeed. Here's a very smart, perceptive, multi-talented artist with a splendidly creative, wicked wit and a flowing inspiration. No surprise Leno treated him with great respect; most of the great comics, Seinfeld and Romano for example, feel very much the same.",5,A true original,1193011200,"10 22, 2007",2007,507,"['terrific', 'retrospective', 'Robert', 'Klein', 'ever-evolving', 'talent', ""'m"", 'particularly', 'pleased', 'get', 'see', 'early', 'HBO', 'shows', 'Robert', 'said', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'days', 'HBO', 'had', 'fewer', 'half', 'million', 'subscribers', 'are', 'rare', 'films', 'indeed', 'Here', 'very', 'smart', 'perceptive', 'multi-talented', 'artist', 'splendidly', 'creative', 'wicked', 'wit', 'flowing', 'inspiration', 'surprise', 'Leno', 'treated', 'great', 'respect', 'most', 'great', 'comics', 'Seinfeld', 'Romano', 'example', 'feel', 'very', 'much', 'same']",Robert Klein: The HBO Specials 1975-2005

I even bought a pair of blue and white saddle shoes in the 70s. One day I was listening to my comedy records and I discovered how much of my sense of humor was based on Klein's jokes and observations. Although I always liked George Carlin too, his accurate observations of human behavior can be quite depressing at times. Robert Klein makes you think, but he never gets you down.I missed most of these shows when they were originally aired on HBO and after hearing them years later, I think they hold up well in the 21st Century, especially for a Child of the 50s.",5,The Other Intellectual Comic,1205452800,"03 14, 2008",2008,640,"['Robert', 'Klein', 'been', 'major', 'influence', 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'even', 'bought', 'pair', 'blue', 'white', 'saddle', 'shoes', '70s', 'One', 'day', 'was', 'listening', 'comedy', 'records', 'discovered', 'how', 'much', 'sense', 'humor', 'was', 'based', 'Klein', 'jokes', 'observations', 'always', 'liked', 'George', 'Carlin', 'too', 'accurate', 'observations', 'human', 'behavior', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'depressing', 'times', 'Robert', 'Klein', 'think', 'never', 'down.I', 'missed', 'most', 'shows', 'when', 'were', 'originally', 'aired', 'HBO', 'hearing', 'years', 'later', 'think', 'hold', 'up', 'well', '21st', 'Century', 'especially', 'Child', '50s']",Robert Klein: The HBO Specials 1975-2005
1084938,A1NR6THMWS2JZO,B000S1MM5C,Volunteer of America,"[27, 28]","I was highly amused to watch an advance review copy of this DVD set, having been entertained on and off since the Sixties by Robert Klein's intelligent, articulate, surrealistic comedy.This DVD set - as far as I know the only available DVD of Klein's performances - is a reasonably priced, very comprehensive (close to eight hours over four decades) and extremely amusing perspective on Robert's long career. It's clear that he has not stood still as a man or a comedian, and it's interesting for a fan to see his development and growth. His considerable gift for mimicry, effortless and constant segues, and sarcastic commentary on contemporary affairs will keep you laughing.Some of my favorite pieces were his soulful ode to colonoscopies, sung in a Manilow-ish manner; Pat Boone doing Little Richard songs (hilarious), the search for John Wayne Bobbitt's lost member...this is a man who has found humor in many areas of life, delivers it with great &eacute;lan, and shows no sign of slowing down! He's a pretty good singer and harmonica player, into the bargain.",5,Counterculture Comic,1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,1066,"['was', 'highly', 'amused', 'watch', 'advance', 'review', 'copy', 'DVD', 'set', 'having', 'been', 'entertained', 'Sixties', 'Robert', 'Klein', 'intelligent', 'articulate', 'surrealistic', 'comedy.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'only', 'available', 'DVD', 'Klein', 'performances', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'very', 'comprehensive', 'close', 'eight', 'hours', 'four', 'decades', 'extremely', 'amusing', 'perspective', 'Robert', 'long', 'career', 'clear', 'not', 'stood', 'still', 'man', 'comedian', 'interesting', 'fan', 'see', 'development', 'growth', 'considerable', 'gift', 'mimicry', 'effortless', 'constant', 'segues', 'sarcastic', 'commentary', 'contemporary', 'affairs', 'will', 'keep', 'laughing.Some', 'favorite', 'pieces', 'were', 'soulful', 'ode', 'colonoscopies', 'sung', 'Manilow-ish', 'manner', 'Pat', 'Boone', 'doing', 'Little', 'Richard', 'songs', 'hilarious', 'search', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Bobbitt', 'lost', 'member', 'man', 'who', 'found', 'humor', 'many', 'areas', 'life', 'delivers', 'great', 'eacute', 'sign', 'slowing', 'down', 'pretty', 'good', 'singer', 'harmonica', 'player', 'bargain']",Robert Klein: The HBO Specials 1975-2005
