1256011,A1NCPGUX2M8JQ7,B0028S10YM,David E. Hartman,"[3, 4]","This film is really a battle of the bizarre fathers: between John Goodman who prefers being chauffeured lying down in the back of a hearse and Ed Asner, a goofily semi-demented back to nature grandfather who has his grown multi-lingual sons over for a hallucinogenic tea party.  Goodman and Asner alone are worth the price of the DVD.The main character played by Paul Dano is a kind of urban, mattress-selling ""Lars"" of Lars and the Real Girl; you're not sure how much of his reality is real or why, but everyone else seems to take his off axis mental status in stride.  Paul plays Brian, a sweet, shy guy who, unaccountably, stays that way after meeting Zoe Deschanel. Zoe, I think, just plays Zoe; quirky, beautiful, messed up by an obliviously cruel mother, and indulged by her hyperrich hypereccentric father (Goodman); she lives in an ADD world where she is unable to keep a job or a boyfriend.  She's charming, believably vulnerable and heartfelt.The movie has an odd and disturbing (well, everything is relative) subplot involving an individual who may be violently stalking Brian, and there is also Brian's apparently lifelong intent (obsession?) to adopt a Chinese baby girl.  Zoe may or may not be pregnant by the end of the film, which just ends and drops you on the floor abruptly, as if the filmmaker decided that if attention deficit disorder is good enough for his characters, it's good enough for the film.So, bottom line, if you like quirky movies, and really good, really eccentric acting, add this to your collection.",4,"Eccentricity, battle of the weird dads, and the Attention Deficit Couple of the Year.",1266710400,"02 21, 2010",2010,1536,"['film', 'really', 'battle', 'bizarre', 'fathers', 'John', 'Goodman', 'who', 'being', 'chauffeured', 'lying', 'down', 'back', 'hearse', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'goofily', 'semi-demented', 'back', 'nature', 'grandfather', 'who', 'grown', 'multi-lingual', 'sons', 'hallucinogenic', 'tea', 'party', 'Goodman', 'Asner', 'alone', 'are', 'worth', 'price', 'DVD.The', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'kind', 'urban', 'mattress-selling', 'Lars', 'Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'reality', 'real', 'why', 'everyone', 'else', 'take', 'off', 'axis', 'mental', 'status', 'stride', 'Paul', 'Brian', 'sweet', 'shy', 'guy', 'who', 'unaccountably', 'stays', 'way', 'meeting', 'Zoe', 'Deschanel', 'Zoe', 'think', 'just', 'Zoe', 'quirky', 'beautiful', 'messed', 'up', 'obliviously', 'cruel', 'mother', 'indulged', 'hyperrich', 'hypereccentric', 'father', 'Goodman', 'ADD', 'world', 'where', 'unable', 'keep', 'job', 'boyfriend', 'charming', 'believably', 'vulnerable', 'heartfelt.The', 'movie', 'odd', 'disturbing', 'well', 'everything', 'relative', 'subplot', 'involving', 'individual', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'violently', 'stalking', 'Brian', 'also', 'Brian', 'apparently', 'lifelong', 'intent', 'obsession', 'adopt', 'Chinese', 'baby', 'girl', 'Zoe', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'pregnant', 'end', 'film', 'just', 'floor', 'abruptly', 'filmmaker', 'decided', 'attention', 'deficit', 'disorder', 'good', 'enough', 'characters', 'good', 'enough', 'film.So', 'bottom', 'line', 'like', 'quirky', 'movies', 'really', 'good', 'really', 'eccentric', 'acting', 'add', 'collection']",Gigantic

I've seen half the movie thus far and this movie wants to be quirky and off-beat but doesn't deliver.  Most disappointingly, it delves into the tired subjects of sex and drugs with shallow treatment.  Also, the dialogue in the movie is flat and uninspired.  It's particularly annoying how several individuals in the movie are supposedly doctor level education but use the vernacular of sophmoric losers.  Paul Dano's desire to adopt a chinese baby is an attempt at cutey-quirky that really lacks authenticity.  J. Goodman and E.

1256017,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0028S10YM,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[20, 22]","Gigantic is another independent romantic-comedy starring Zooey Deschanel. Like other films of this sort that she's starred in, it's not your typical, everything-turns-out-fine, big box-office take romantic-comedy. Instead, it's a subtle, quirky film with whimsical characters that is hardly the first of it's kind, but is still a unique little movie.Paul Dano (also the executive producer) is a mopey, 28-year-old mattress salesmen named Brian who's in the process of adopting a Chinese baby. One day, Al Lolly (John Goodman), a successful, loud-mouthed man with back problems comes in and buys a mattress. His daughter Happy (Deschanel) comes in to take care of the financial aspects and ends up falling asleep on one of the bed's.Ed Asner co-stars as Brian's elderly father, while Zach Galifianakis (a recent scene-stealer in The Hangover) plays a mysterious, mute homeless man.What is instantly striking is the unique characters and the subtle things that make them unique. One character introduces himself with ""'sup dude? Not much,"" everytime he enters a room. There's the bizarre, mute homeless man of course. And how many beautiful, eccentric girls randomly fall asleep in a mattress warehouse? So, yes the character's are unique...But they don't come off as being written in such a way. My impression of the character's was not one of a writer saying ""look at my unique characters!"" They seem normal, real, just not without their eccentricities.The acting really brings that quality out. Dano has played every sort of character and his quiet, disconnected Brian is another winning performance. Goodman has played a loud-mouthed, sympathetic character before and few actors are better at it. Finally, although not expanding her acting range much, Deschanel is a charmer...She once again plays a character that's reserved and complicated, but you can see how someone could instantly fall for her.Gigantic did not blow me away, but it's got many admirable qualities. I enjoyed it's subtle, deadpan humor. It doesn't seem to reach for laughs, but will graciously accept them if the timing is right. Co-writer/director Matt Aselton marks his directorial debut here and he doesn't seem to have totally hit his creative stride yet. There are scenes in Gigantic that feel out-of-place, like Aselton didn't focus on a completely linear story arc. Also, I'm not sure about the necessity of the Galifianakis character.Gigantic is an ironic title for a film of this scope. It's a simple film about complicated people that simplifies their ""gigantic"" complications in their otherwise typical, fruitless lives. It's low-key and light-on-it's-feet and although I enjoyed it, I couldn't help but think that it had more potential than it fulfilled. It's not perfect, but a strong debut by a filmmaker who could make something very special in the future.GRADE: B-",4,"A Charming, Low-Key Film",1250380800,"08 16, 2009",2009,2853,"['Gigantic', 'independent', 'romantic-comedy', 'starring', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'other', 'films', 'sort', 'starred', 'not', 'typical', 'everything-turns-out-fine', 'big', 'box-office', 'take', 'romantic-comedy', 'Instead', 'subtle', 'quirky', 'film', 'whimsical', 'characters', 'hardly', 'first', 'kind', 'still', 'unique', 'little', 'movie.Paul', 'Dano', 'also', 'executive', 'producer', 'mopey', '28-year-old', 'mattress', 'salesmen', 'named', 'Brian', 'who', 'process', 'adopting', 'Chinese', 'baby', 'One', 'day', 'Al', 'Lolly', 'John', 'Goodman', 'successful', 'loud-mouthed', 'man', 'back', 'problems', 'buys', 'mattress', 'daughter', 'Happy', 'Deschanel', 'take', 'care', 'financial', 'aspects', 'up', 'falling', 'asleep', 'one', ""bed's.Ed"", 'Asner', 'co-stars', 'Brian', 'elderly', 'father', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'recent', 'scene-stealer', 'Hangover', 'mysterious', 'mute', 'homeless', 'man.What', 'instantly', 'striking', 'unique', 'characters', 'subtle', 'things', 'make', 'unique', 'One', 'character', ""'sup"", 'dude', 'Not', 'much', 'everytime', 'room', 'bizarre', 'mute', 'homeless', 'man', 'course', 'how', 'many', 'beautiful', 'eccentric', 'girls', 'randomly', 'fall', 'asleep', 'mattress', 'warehouse', 'So', 'yes', 'character', 'are', 'unique', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'being', 'written', 'such', 'way', 'impression', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'writer', 'saying', 'look', 'unique', 'characters', 'seem', 'normal', 'real', 'just', 'not', 'eccentricities.The', 'acting', 'really', 'quality', 'out', 'Dano', 'played', 'sort', 'character', 'quiet', 'disconnected', 'Brian', 'winning', 'performance', 'Goodman', 'played', 'loud-mouthed', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'few', 'actors', 'are', 'better', 'Finally', 'not', 'expanding', 'acting', 'range', 'much', 'Deschanel', 'charmer', 'once', 'again', 'character', 'reserved', 'complicated', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'someone', 'could', 'instantly', 'fall', 'her.Gigantic', 'did', 'not', 'blow', 'away', 'got', 'many', 'admirable', 'qualities', 'enjoyed', 'subtle', 'deadpan', 'humor', ""n't"", 'seem', 'reach', 'laughs', 'will', 'graciously', 'accept', 'timing', 'right', 'Co-writer/director', 'Matt', 'Aselton', 'directorial', 'debut', 'here', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'totally', 'hit', 'creative', 'stride', 'yet', 'are', 'scenes', 'Gigantic', 'feel', 'out-of-place', 'Aselton', 'did', ""n't"", 'focus', 'completely', 'linear', 'story', 'arc', 'Also', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'necessity', 'Galifianakis', 'character.Gigantic', 'ironic', 'title', 'film', 'scope', 'simple', 'film', 'complicated', 'people', 'gigantic', 'complications', 'otherwise', 'typical', 'fruitless', 'lives', 'low-key', ""light-on-it's-feet"", 'enjoyed', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'had', 'more', 'potential', 'fulfilled', 'not', 'perfect', 'strong', 'debut', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'could', 'make', 'something', 'very', 'special', 'future.GRADE', 'B-']",Gigantic

The story, about a mattress salesman (Dano) who falls in love with the eccentric daughter (Deschanel) of a tyrannical, blowhard tycoon (John Goodman) contains half a dozen subplots, none of which is believable in the slightest. Nevertheless, the ensemble cast (which includes Edward Asner and Jane Alexander) could not be more ingratiating, and largely because of them ""Gigantic"" flows along entertainingly despite the general weirdness. However, one subplot almost causes the film to go off the rails altogether: the subplot in which a homeless man (Zach Galifinakis, just before ""The Hangover"" made him a star) repeatedly and violently attacks Dano's character for no discernible reason. This subplot is a total bummer, particularly in its resolution, and flouts believability all too brazenly. It hurts the film, but fortunately doesn't succeed in killing it.

The cover suggests this for the same reason - the inexplicable appearance of whats-her-face, the hottie. Her motives are utterly alien, so I figured the character's mind is being driven by a screenwriter who has a specialty splash guard on his monitor. As it turns out, it wasn't shaping up at all. No character is developed to the point at which I could describe them, much less categorize them.I'm sure the screenwriter set out to make this quirky - very deliberately, in-your-face quirky.

An irrational ""love"" story filled with the single most dysfunctional group of dorks I have ever enjoyed watching. Two obscure performances from Ed Asner and the mute Zach Galifianakis underscore the boldest roles for Zooey and Paul Dano I have seen outside of their mainstream stuff.It is difficult to explain as I found it hard to classify this a comedy, but the laugh out loud moments of excellent writing were numerous and placed just right. The story follows two young lovers as they traverse their ""jobs"", un-describable families, and each of their respective dysfunctions. Along the way we are subjected to Galifianakis' homeless stalker, Ed Asner's bizarre dad insight, and a Japanese spa scene that if described, would not allow this review to get posted (do not remember seeing anything like that on film before).The filming is unique, the 5.1 is decent and picture quality is good. The special features are sparse but contain one of the most relevant deleted/alternate scenes I have watched in some time. Had they edited that 30 second clip into the film (the alternate scene clip), it would have changed the entire premise. The stills gallery is forgettable and a trailer is included. Would have preferred to see more about the brains behind this and maybe a featurette, but the film is an interesting piece on its own. It says R for language, sexual content and violence, but nudity should be in there also for the Zooey/pool scene, albeit from a distance.",4,Obscure & totally dysfunctional - loved it.,1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,1494,"['What', 'great', 'little', 'film', 'irrational', 'love', 'story', 'filled', 'single', 'most', 'dysfunctional', 'group', 'dorks', 'have', 'ever', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Two', 'obscure', 'performances', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'mute', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'boldest', 'roles', 'Zooey', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'have', 'seen', 'mainstream', 'stuff.It', 'difficult', 'explain', 'found', 'hard', 'classify', 'comedy', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moments', 'excellent', 'writing', 'were', 'numerous', 'placed', 'just', 'right', 'story', 'two', 'young', 'lovers', 'traverse', 'jobs', 'un-describable', 'families', 'respective', 'dysfunctions', 'way', 'are', 'subjected', 'Galifianakis', 'homeless', 'stalker', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'bizarre', 'dad', 'insight', 'Japanese', 'spa', 'scene', 'described', 'would', 'not', 'allow', 'review', 'get', 'posted', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'seeing', 'anything', 'film', '.The', 'filming', 'unique', '5.1', 'decent', 'picture', 'quality', 'good', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'sparse', 'contain', 'one', 'most', 'relevant', 'deleted/alternate', 'scenes', 'have', 'watched', 'time', 'Had', 'edited', '30', 'second', 'clip', 'film', 'alternate', 'scene', 'clip', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'entire', 'premise', 'stills', 'gallery', 'forgettable', 'trailer', 'included', 'Would', 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'more', 'brains', 'maybe', 'featurette', 'film', 'interesting', 'piece', 'own', 'R', 'language', 'sexual', 'content', 'violence', 'nudity', 'should', 'be', 'there', 'also', 'Zooey/pool', 'scene', 'distance']",Gigantic
