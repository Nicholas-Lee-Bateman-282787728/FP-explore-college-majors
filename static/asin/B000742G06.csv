876561,A3LKP6WPMP9UKX,B000742G06,Anna V. Carroll,"[3, 7]","I have had the VHS version for years and once or twice a year I sit down and watch it with a cup of tea by my side.  It's difficult to believe it is already 25 years since it aired on television.  Amazing how time flies and history repeats itself. The acting is superb.  The actors are almost the mirror-image of the actual Edward and Wallis Simpson.  There is one scene that is worth the price of the two discs: When the Duke of Windsor's girlfriend returns from her visit to the US, is invited to the Duke's home for tea and is startled to see her best friend, Mrs. Simpson rush in with the Prince acting as if she owns the place.  There is the wink and the nod that told the world: this is serious.  I never tire of looking at that.At the time people in certain circles couldn't get enough of the Prince and Mrs. Simpson.  Then, when they fell out of favor and were banished from England, those closest to them were banished as well.  The same thing pretty much happened after Prince Charles and Lady Diana's divorce.  Those people close to Diana were no longer welcome at certain events.  Now it's Charles and Camilla.  The people who rallied to their side after the separation are safe, for now.  For such a small island England has mesmerized the world for centuries and centuries.While the Charles and Diana story will be around for some time, 100 years from now, people will still be reading and talking about the Duke of Windsor and the American, Mrs. Simpson.  This film gives you the entire story from beginning to the beginning of the end.  I highly recommend it to anyone who has a deep affection for England (as do I) and a love of history.

876566,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000742G06,C. O. DeRiemer,"[81, 86]","This production, in my view, is one of the glories of Masterpiece Theater. The acting is excellent, from the leads to the extras. The story is fascinating, especially if you like peeking at the lives of royalty and the upper crust. Every pound Thames Television put into the show is visible; the settings are authentic or look it; the costumes appear bespoke, as they say; and everyone's manners are immaculate, even if what they do isn't.It's the story of the affair between Edward, Prince of Wales, later Edward VIII, and Wallis Warfield Simpson, an American twice-married divorcee. It starts just before he meets her and ends shortly after he abdicates the British throne to marry ""the woman I love."" He became the Duke of Windsor and she his Duchess. It was probably the biggest story of its time. The program runs for six 60 minute installments. Because of the style, the acting and the story of these two people, who are so self-indulgent and so obtuse (on his part) and so calculating and brittle (on her part), it never seems boring.Edward, played by Edward Fox, is a man of great charm and handsome appearance, a man girls swoon over and men wish to be like. He's also privileged, unselfconsciously selfish and not really too bright. He's a man who seems most comfortable with older women, women who can cosset and coo over him. His mistresses have all been older and married. Edward Fox, a fine actor, is wonderful in the part. (For those who might not recognize his name, he was the Jackal in The Day of the Jackal). Wallis, played by Cynthia Harris, is a woman who can seem hard and even scheming, but who also has some vulnerability about her that makes her at least somewhat sympathetic.Among the fine cast is Nigel Hawthorne as Walter Monckton, one of Edward's loyal but realistic counsellors; Cherie Lunghi as Lady Thelma Furness, a mistress Edward casts off by simply telling his switchboard not to accept anymore of her calls; David Waller as Stanley Baldwin, the shrewd prime minister; and Jessie Mathews as Wallis' Aunt Bessie Merryman, all pink and plump and powdered...and keen-eyed. (Mathews in the Thirties was the toast of the London stage, singing and dancing in a number of musicals. She introduced Rodgers and Hart's ""Dancing on the Ceiling."")If you like Masterpiece Theater or similar shows, I think you'll like this program very much. The DVD picture is very good.

Behrens ""Frank Behrens""","[70, 78]","""The King of England and the woman for whom he gave up a throne"" has nearly passed into legend, as has the much re-recorded abdication speech give by Edward VIII in which he explained in his own voice (kings by tradition had no right to express personal opinions in public) that all he wanted was to be with the woman he loved. Whether or not she was a scheming Lady Macbeth who wanted to be a queen will never really be known, but it makes an interesting challenge for an actress who plays the part of the American, twice-divorced Mrs. Simpson.I was delighted to learn that A&E; has restored the 1978 mini-series, ""Edward & Mrs. Simpson"" in a boxed set of two DVDs (AAE 71753). In seven episodes of 50 minutes each, it tells the tale of how Edward (Edward Fox) first runs into Wallis Simpson (Cynthia Harris), becomes obsessed with her, drives all of the higher-ups in the British government half mad seeking ways to satisfy their master and at the same time stopping a marriage which could not constitutionally exist.As scripted, Simpson is no sympathetic character but a woman used to getting what she wants, even if it is  the next King of England. Unhappily, Edward (who is called David throughout the series) is shown to be a spoiled brat who often puts his pleasures before his duties; and by the time one might really feel sorry for him, some can only say, ""What did you expect?"" and ""You got what you thoroughly deserved.""As fine as Fox and Harris are as actors, there is none of that special ""chemistry"" needed to convince us that these two were (or at least that he was) so madly obsessed with each other. And while there is much talk about how fascinating Wallis was to all who met her, the viewer hardly sees anything matching that description.But what a pleasure it is to see consummate actors do their stuff, especially supported by such British stars as Nigel Hawthorne, Peggy Ashcroft (as the outraged Queen Mary),  John Shrapnel, David Waller (as the long-suffering Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin), Patricia Hodge (from the Rumpole series), and too many others to mention here.A final irony is found in the bonus feature, ""Wallis Simpson"" from A&E;'s Biography series, when we are told that Simpson was carrying on another affair all through her stalking of Edward! It would be interesting to know how this would have changed the script if this information were known back then.In sum, although I think that just under six hours is far too long to carry this story and keep things sparking (150 minutes would have been about right), I can still recommend this set for the acting, the period d&eacute;cor, and the discussions it is bound to stimulate among the viewers.",4,Was SHE worth giving up a crown?,1109203200,"02 24, 2005",2005,2687,"['King', 'England', 'woman', 'whom', 'gave', 'up', 'throne', 'nearly', 'passed', 'legend', 'much', 're-recorded', 'abdication', 'speech', 'give', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'explained', 'own', 'voice', 'kings', 'tradition', 'had', 'right', 'express', 'personal', 'opinions', 'public', 'wanted', 'was', 'be', 'woman', 'loved', 'Whether', 'not', 'was', 'scheming', 'Lady', 'Macbeth', 'who', 'wanted', 'be', 'queen', 'will', 'never', 'really', 'be', 'known', 'interesting', 'challenge', 'actress', 'who', 'part', 'American', 'twice-divorced', 'Mrs.', 'Simpson.I', 'was', 'delighted', 'learn', 'A', 'E', 'restored', '1978', 'mini-series', 'Edward', 'Mrs.', 'Simpson', 'boxed', 'set', 'two', 'DVDs', 'AAE', '71753', 'seven', 'episodes', '50', 'minutes', 'tale', 'how', 'Edward', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'first', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'Cynthia', 'Harris', 'obsessed', 'higher-ups', 'British', 'government', 'half', 'mad', 'seeking', 'ways', 'satisfy', 'master', 'same', 'time', 'stopping', 'marriage', 'could', 'not', 'constitutionally', 'exist.As', 'scripted', 'Simpson', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'woman', 'used', 'getting', 'what', 'even', 'next', 'King', 'England', 'Unhappily', 'Edward', 'who', 'called', 'David', 'series', 'shown', 'be', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'who', 'often', 'pleasures', 'duties', 'time', 'one', 'might', 'really', 'feel', 'sorry', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'What', 'did', 'expect', 'got', 'what', 'thoroughly', 'deserved', 'As', 'fine', 'Fox', 'Harris', 'are', 'actors', 'none', 'special', 'chemistry', 'needed', 'convince', 'two', 'were', 'least', 'was', 'so', 'madly', 'obsessed', 'other', 'much', 'talk', 'how', 'fascinating', 'Wallis', 'was', 'who', 'met', 'viewer', 'hardly', 'anything', 'matching', 'what', 'pleasure', 'see', 'consummate', 'actors', 'do', 'stuff', 'especially', 'supported', 'such', 'British', 'stars', 'Nigel', 'Hawthorne', 'Peggy', 'Ashcroft', 'outraged', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'John', 'Shrapnel', 'David', 'Waller', 'long-suffering', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Stanley', 'Baldwin', 'Patricia', 'Hodge', 'Rumpole', 'series', 'too', 'many', 'others', 'mention', 'here.A', 'final', 'irony', 'found', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'A', 'E', 'Biography', 'series', 'when', 'are', 'told', 'Simpson', 'was', 'carrying', 'affair', 'stalking', 'Edward', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'know', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'script', 'information', 'were', 'known', 'back', 'then.In', 'sum', 'think', 'just', 'six', 'hours', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'carry', 'story', 'keep', 'things', 'sparking', '150', 'minutes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'about', 'right', 'can', 'still', 'recommend', 'set', 'acting', 'period', 'd', 'eacute', 'cor', 'discussions', 'bound', 'stimulate', 'viewers']",N/A

This in part may be due to experiencing the worst financial crisis of our life in the last two years.  The era pre and post 1929 crash and depression and WWII serve as a window into what these two societies were like and how they managed to come out of these exceptionally trying times to thrive in years to come.  That said, about the Masterpiece Theater ""Edward and Mrs. Simpson"", a very well done series and worth the watch with some caveats.The story line is well told by many other reviewers so I will not repeat it here only to say it is a good history lesson about how the British view their royalty and the love affair between the King to be played brilliantly by Edward Fox and Mrs. Simpson also brilliantly played by Cynthia Harris.  I agree with all the other reviewers that both of these excellent actors capture the character of the selfish nearly childish, self absorbed playboy Prince of Wales and the social climbing somewhat devious getting her man at all cost, Mrs. Simpson.  The settings are period correct and the transfer from the original screening to DVD was very good.As mentioned by some reviewers the storyline did drag at points and more time could have been spent on the Prince and Mrs. Simpson rather than all the stogy British parliamentary figures.  It is understandable that as part telling the story that has fascinated people since the abdication to this time, we would want more salacious details, more sumptuous gowns, and jewels as the upper royal class was prone to wear even to breakfast.  Queen Mary with multiple strands of pearls mid day may have been a window into the reason for the decline in the Royal family's popularity.  Being American I know the British would strongly disagree as they do not like anyone criticizing their Royalty.  The long drawn out dialogue and hand ringing by the aids to the King (This is where Royalty trumps logic.  They refer to him as King yet he has yet to be crowned so would he not still be the Prince?  Understanding the British Royal ""system"" as an American could consume a lot of time!)  although at times boring and slow showed how much time they spent trying to figure out Mrs. Simpson's motives once she was divorced and what the Kings intentions were towards her in terms of marriage.  As much as it was slow paced and somewhat boring towards the middle of the series, it did contribute to the historical understanding of why he could not marry Mrs. Simpson as King, leaving the question of abdication as the only solution.More interplay between Edward and Wallace during this time would have offered up more insight into the character of these two individuals and who was really the driving force in Edward's future.  Wallace seemed very insecure about letting him out of her sight for any length of time given his reputation for being a play boy and the fact he was under great pressure by his family and a cast of many self serving politicians to do the right thing and just keep her as his consort.  Historically that does seem to be the British solution.  Edward could have married a woman he did not love, pop out a couple of Royalty and gone about with his affair and still be king.  This is the Prince Charles modern day solution.  All this leads to the question of whether or not Edward would have made a good King or was the country better off with his brother on the throne?  If you are looking for this series to provide insight into this question you may be disappointed.  It leaves this up to the viewer to decide if anyone could be that crazy in love with a cloying older woman that he would give up the position to which he were born and bred to assume.  Maybe you have to be British or have studied the Royal family to get all the innuendos and subtleties.The miniseries is worth the time to wade through the slow parts and perhaps understand how the British handle crisis around their Royal family. Now it is on to another miniseries about Albert and the Queen mum!As a final comment, I realize the British are very sensitve about criticism of their Royality by anyone but themselves.

Apparently it has not been remastered.  It is somewhat better than the VHS tape but not a lot better. I've never seen a more annoying portrayal of anybody than this of Mrs. Simpson. It may be accurate but if that is really the way she talked then I can't imagine anybody being able to stand to be around her for more than l0 minutes at a time. And, while Mrs. Simpson was not young and not a beauty, I think they could have found a little more attractive actress for the role. I always had the picture in my mind of Mrs. Simpson as someone with a soft southern voice, gentle manner, immense charm, the ability to convince others that she was pretty.  She would have a wonderful sense of humor and would have been able to convince others that she found them fascinating. The way she plays it just doesn't fit to me at all. Cold and calculating is a better description of this woman. And, I agree with another viewer that there is no real connection between them. One gets no sense of a deep love on either of their parts nor a real sexual connection between them. He had a history of becoming involved with married women but this time he apparently got involved with the wrong married woman. One who would suck him into the affair so deeply that he didn't know how to get out nor did he really want to. In her madly egotistical mind and her ignorance she really thought that she could be Queen of England. Royal children were traditionally under the thumb of domineering Nannies and it's possible that he never grew out of his thinking that love and domination were one thing. There has been much talk of things that she learned in the far east that enslaved him and this may or may not be true. I just think he was really looking for a way out of having to be King and used this as what he considered to be the honorable way out. After all, he was already doing a crappy job of it before the abdication.  He had to put on an act to convince her that he didn't want to abdicate as apparently she never gave him a minute's peace. In the end, of course, he did. All in all it was the best thing for the country. I guess God really does move in mysterious ways. Edward VIII would have been a disaster as a war time King and there is no doubt in my mind that England would have come under Nazi control under his rule.

Edward Fox gives one of the finest performances of his career as the famed King Edward VIII from the dashing playboy Prince Of Wales to the man who gives up the throne for the woman he loves.

Thankfully both Fox and Harris share a nice chemistry between them that makes them quite convincing as the famed couple.The supporting cast is fine as well. David Waller gives a fine performance as the Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin who tires to keep the government together in the midsts of the crisis caused by the title characters as does Peggy Ashcroft as the famed Queen Mary. From Nigel Hawthorne as Edward's friend Walter Monkton to Wensley Pithey as Winston Churchill to Charles Keating as Wallis husband Ernest Simpson to Marius Goring and Patrick Troughton as opposition leader Clement Attlee the cast is a fine one and makes this drama well worth seeing.Things are strong behind the camera as well. The sets by Allan Cameron and the costumes by Jennie Tate perfectly capture the spirit of the 1930's in which this famed story took place. The score and opening song by Ron Grainer also captures the atmosphere of the 1930's as well. Even better, the script by Simon Raven (from the biography Edrward VIII by Frances Donaldson) is a true highlight. With its attention to details and events the script gives a detailed study of a royal romance that doesn't quite end happily. The dialouge in particular makes the production stand out and gives the whole production an epic quality thanks to the wonderful direction of Waris Hussein.If the miniseries has any fault it is that it seems overlong. At seven fifty minute episodes (or right around six hours) it feels as though it could have been trimmed down at times. There aren't many slow moments in the miniseries but one wonders if those scenes trimmed could have made Edward & Mrs. Simpson slightly shorter.Despite is length Edward & Mrs. Simpson is a fine drama. From its two leading actors to the supporting cast, production values, direction and writing this is a fine example of the art of the miniseries.

Edward Fox and Cynthia Harris are Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson.  The setting, costumes, dialogue: all these are so authentic.  Whenever I see this version, I feel overwhelming sympathy for both Wallis and Edward.  I tend to feel that love trumps duty in a competition when opposed to an institution that has several ""heirs.""  For a job such as that, anyone can follow the traditional protocols, but for a real love there are only the two individuals.  The real evil in this story was that the Duke of Windsor's family did not forgive him for so many years in support of Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon's (Elizabeth II's mother; George VI's wife) revenge.  Boooo!  Now how noble is stubborn revenge???  And how noble is it to risk everything for love???I am appeased when I realize that exile was not too bad for them, nor was a frivolous life of pleasure, as opposed to giving up a love that stood the test of time by doing what institutionalized mindsets want.  I feel that if you don't have a chance at real love, then hey, . . . love a dog, cat, or your job.  But if you can give and receive love, then this is a miracle not to be missed.Of course, there are stories of how Wallis abused the Duke, and how he was some kind of wimp, but I find far better and stronger evidence to support their mutual love.Please see the A&E; Biography Documentary at the end of Disk 2.

876591,A1GHO6BR5J0NHX,B000742G06,Richard Masloski,"[3, 4]","The title of this review is a quote from Adolf Hitler in reference to Mrs. Simpson's qualities as hypothetical Queen had she won the gold, which it seems likely she wished to do. The Fuhrer met both she and her husband, the late King of England, when the newlyweds visited Hitler at Berchtesgaden in 1937.  What there is nary a whisper of in this seven part mini-series from 1978 are the extremely pro-Nazi sympathies of both Edward and Mrs. Simpson.Now it is told that Hitler's favorite movies were KING KONG and SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS.  Who can comprehend the ultimate psychological and aesthetic reasons for his cinematic predilections?  There is simply no accounting for taste! Just as one is left not truly knowing what it was magnetized the Prince of Wales to the social-climber Wallis Simpson.  The fairytale of it all being about LOVE is pretty much in dispute.  Perhaps the marrying a twice-divorced woman that would force the King to abdicate was more an excuse to quit a throne he never really felt comfortable sitting upon.  Perhaps the Prince longed to be a Pauper and, with a masochistic streak that is common in men in powerful positions, perhaps he found his domme in Wallis.  Hitler, too, it is said, craved scatologic debasements that truly ran afoul of the Wagnerian persona that was the dictator's public facade.  History in the spotlight may show surface warts and blemishes, but torrid Truth often thrives best in dank darkness and steamy shadow.  Like mushrooms at night, much is the story of Mankind.So entertaining though this production most definitely is to those in the dark as to the fuller picture, once one knows that infernal more, the mini-series seems to be precisely that, more entertaining than truly educational on an emotional level.  EDWARD AND MRS. SIMPSON is, actually, more of an examination of British law and politics and custom than it is about LOVE.  There is no scripted or otherwise spark twixt the two leads, no hint of an understanding as to what it was between them.  None of the perplexed cast of characters ever even asks either one of them what it is, precisely, they so much love about one another.  Perhaps, historically, more contemporaneous folks were in the know as to the true reasons for the attraction which led to abdication than we sideliners and spectators will ever know.In some of the other reviews, mention is made of a biography of Mrs. Simpson as extra.  I have the two-disc A&E; DVD, all five hours and thirty minutes of it - but there is no extra biography to be found on either disc.
