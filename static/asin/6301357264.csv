Ally, an angel who has never been to Earth, is sent to Earth shortly after their romance begins.  Mike, determined to find her and reunite their love, returns to Earth.  Mike, who is now named Elmo, endures heartache, loneliness, and becomes lost as he drifts away from his unconscious desire.  I don't want to ruin it for you, but I promise you, you won't be disappointed.  Remember, &quot;...if you don't know where you're goin', then it doesn't matter which road you take....&quot;I still cry everytime I see it.

Supporting roles and cameos include several well-known musicians, creator of the single panel newspaper comic THE FAR SIDE (Gary Larson), and Debra Winger as a male spirit named Emmett. This sweet period piece is set in the 1950s.SYNOPSIS--Mike drowns after heroically rescuing a family trapped in a car that's plunged into a river. As a heavenly spirit, he meets and weds Annie, a brand new soul who's never been to Earth. When Annie's number is called for being born, Mike gets permission from heaven's boss, Emmett to also reincarnate, but he has only 30 years in which to find Annie. If Mike fails, he'll have to endure an unhappy life with other people that could end with his never again seeing the Pearly Gates.The two grow up separately and lead remarkably different Earthly lives. As Mike's 30th birthday approaches, he still hasn't found Annie.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(6.1) Made in Heaven (1987) - Timothy Hutton/Kelly McGillis/Maureen Stapleton/Mare Winningham/Don Murray/Tim Daly/Amanda Plummer/Neil Young/Tom Petty/Ric Ocasek/John Considine/Mark Isham/Dirk Blocker (uncredited: Ellen Barkin/Debra Winger/Gary Larson)",3,Soulmate in Heaven,1360368000,"02 9, 2013",2013,1308,"['Alan', 'Rudolph', 'MADE', 'IN', 'HEAVEN', 'modern', 'example', 'popular', 'genre', '1930s', ""'40s"", 'heavenly', 'angel/devil', 'fantasy', 'Supporting', 'roles', 'cameos', 'include', 'several', 'well-known', 'musicians', 'creator', 'single', 'panel', 'newspaper', 'THE', 'FAR', 'SIDE', 'Gary', 'Larson', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'male', 'spirit', 'named', 'Emmett', 'sweet', 'period', 'piece', 'set', '1950s.SYNOPSIS', 'Mike', 'drowns', 'heroically', 'rescuing', 'family', 'trapped', 'car', 'plunged', 'river', 'heavenly', 'spirit', 'Annie', 'brand', 'new', 'soul', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'Earth', 'When', 'Annie', 'number', 'called', 'being', 'born', 'Mike', 'permission', 'heaven', 'boss', 'Emmett', 'also', 'reincarnate', 'only', '30', 'years', 'find', 'Annie', 'Mike', ""'ll"", 'have', 'endure', 'unhappy', 'life', 'other', 'people', 'could', 'end', 'never', 'again', 'seeing', 'Pearly', 'Gates.The', 'two', 'grow', 'up', 'separately', 'lead', 'remarkably', 'different', 'Earthly', 'lives', 'Mike', '30th', 'birthday', 'approaches', 'still', ""n't"", 'found', 'Annie.Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'IMDb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '6.1', 'Made', 'Heaven', '1987', 'Timothy', 'Hutton/Kelly', 'McGillis/Maureen', 'Stapleton/Mare', 'Winningham/Don', 'Murray/Tim', 'Daly/Amanda', 'Plummer/Neil', 'Young/Tom', 'Petty/Ric', 'Ocasek/John', 'Considine/Mark', 'Isham/Dirk', 'Blocker', 'uncredited', 'Ellen', 'Barkin/Debra', 'Winger/Gary', 'Larson']",N/A

250381,A3S3VSXEFXBMRC,6301357264,Natasha Chernavska,"[1, 1]","LOVE - is what this movie is about. In fact, I think this is one of the best and sweetest movies about love. It reminded me about myself in my teen age, before I even felt the first touch or kiss. I already knew and felt something like this. As if I already have experienced it. Not just the touch, not just the kiss, but the sensation of intimacy and closeness, that accompanies it. Since then I have barely sensed it in my real life after having a few lovers and being married. But I always knew, that there is something - something very deep and I will feel it. This movie was like an illustration to what I felt: we are all looking for something sacred, unexplainable, something that we have felt long ago (if ever) in this life. May be, that something - is the love from heaven - pure, simple, strong, and deep. May be that's why we don't want to settle and be with somebody we don't really feel deeply connected. I think that a lot of people just see this movie as an easy chick flick - angels, heavens, a little drama here and there just for the sake of happy ending. But to me it's not. To me it's such an inspiration in support on my path to a deeper, meaningful connection, a reminder, that may be, I am right not to agree to have &#34;something&#34; instead of having it all... We'll see, time will tell.

250382,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,6301357264,Nicholas Carroll,"[12, 31]","I was so looking forward to seeing this film after a friend told me about it recently.  I had never even heard of it before, but it covers a topic I'm very much interested in...HEAVEN.  The early scenes in heaven are promising enough and this film is in line with my own beliefs regarding heaven.  That much was a joy to watch, and I wished the film would have been set mostly in heaven with more insight about what goes on there.  Unfortunately, that's not the case, as Timothy Hutton's character meets and falls for Kelly McGillis' character.  Kelly plays a new soul who has never been to earth before, while Timothy's character just recently died.  They fall in love, and the film becomes less about heaven than the love these two have for each other, even though it came across very contrived to me.  Those two have no chemistry together and it was painful to watch them go through the motions of falling in love.  It certainly didn't feel authentic to me, watching it.The character Emmett gave me the creeps.  He plays a strange character whom I got the impression might have been Satan or some other kind of trickster.  Because Kelly fell in love, he sends her to earth to live a life and denies Timothy the chance for love and marriage in heaven, until Timothy pleads with him to give him a chance to find her on earth.  Emmett relents and gives Timothy 30 years to find her, otherwise he'll never be allowed to enter heaven again.  That's kind of harsh, but Timothy agrees and finds himself born as a guy with the unfortunate name of Elmo.We get glimpses of both their lives throughout the years, but not enough to be drawn in completely.  There are some weird scenes that didn't seem to belong in the film, such as when Ellen Barkin pleads with Elmo to start a fight in a bar so she can cheat on the dice and win back her money.  When he does so, she pulls out a gun and steals the money outright.  What this scene has to do with the movie, I don't know...but it was completely out of place.  Probably the only thing going for this film were the cameos by Ric Ocasek of the Cars (in a cleverly placed role), Tom Petty, and Neal Young.My favorite scene was when Elmo is picked up by an elderly couple heading to California, who confess to him that they never pick up hitchikers, but felt compelled to when they saw him.  They treat him to a meal and when you learn his connection to them, it can't help but make you cry.  That is probably the most authentic spiritual element about this film.  It was so well done, that I wish they would have done more of that for the rest of the film.  I also like how Elmo and Allyson keep missing each other in life, and you begin to wonder if he's going to make it before he turns 30.  The ending is very cheesy and poorly done, not to mention that its kind of abrupt and that's it.  If they were strick on time, they should have cut the bar scene with Ellen Barkin and added more to the ending for a greater emotional impact.All in all, not bad for the few moments of spiritual bliss I felt while watching this film, but its not enough to place it on the same level as ""Chances Are"" or ""Defending Your Life"".  The potential was definitely there, but was squandered on unnecessary scenes and characters, marginal acting, lack of chemistry, and some cheesy scenes.  If you want a real spiritual experience about heaven, I suggest reading the novel ""What Dreams May Come"" by Richard Matheson (not the film version).  It will really blow you away with all the details of what we might expect in our afterlife experience.",3,Interesting moments brought down by too much cheesiness,1106697600,"01 26, 2005",2005,3563,"['was', 'so', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'film', 'friend', 'told', 'recently', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'topic', ""'m"", 'very', 'much', 'interested', 'HEAVEN', 'early', 'scenes', 'heaven', 'are', 'promising', 'enough', 'film', 'line', 'own', 'beliefs', 'regarding', 'heaven', 'much', 'was', 'joy', 'watch', 'wished', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'mostly', 'heaven', 'more', 'insight', 'what', 'there', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'case', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'character', 'meets', 'falls', 'Kelly', 'McGillis', 'character', 'Kelly', 'new', 'soul', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'earth', 'before', 'Timothy', 'character', 'just', 'recently', 'died', 'fall', 'love', 'film', 'less', 'heaven', 'love', 'two', 'have', 'other', 'even', 'came', 'very', 'contrived', 'two', 'have', 'chemistry', 'together', 'was', 'painful', 'watch', 'go', 'motions', 'falling', 'love', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'authentic', 'watching', 'it.The', 'character', 'Emmett', 'gave', 'creeps', 'strange', 'character', 'whom', 'got', 'impression', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Satan', 'other', 'kind', 'trickster', 'Kelly', 'fell', 'love', 'earth', 'live', 'life', 'Timothy', 'chance', 'love', 'marriage', 'heaven', 'Timothy', 'pleads', 'give', 'chance', 'find', 'earth', 'Emmett', 'relents', 'Timothy', '30', 'years', 'find', 'otherwise', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'allowed', 'enter', 'heaven', 'again', 'kind', 'harsh', 'Timothy', 'born', 'guy', 'unfortunate', 'name', 'Elmo.We', 'get', 'glimpses', 'lives', 'years', 'not', 'enough', 'be', 'drawn', 'completely', 'are', 'weird', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'belong', 'film', 'such', 'when', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'Elmo', 'start', 'fight', 'bar', 'can', 'cheat', 'dice', 'win', 'back', 'money', 'When', 'so', 'out', 'gun', 'money', 'outright', 'What', 'scene', 'do', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'completely', 'place', 'Probably', 'only', 'thing', 'going', 'film', 'were', 'cameos', 'Ric', 'Ocasek', 'Cars', 'cleverly', 'placed', 'role', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'Neal', 'Young.My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'was', 'when', 'Elmo', 'picked', 'up', 'elderly', 'couple', 'heading', 'California', 'who', 'confess', 'never', 'pick', 'up', 'hitchikers', 'felt', 'compelled', 'when', 'saw', 'treat', 'meal', 'when', 'learn', 'connection', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'make', 'cry', 'probably', 'most', 'authentic', 'spiritual', 'element', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'rest', 'film', 'also', 'how', 'Elmo', 'Allyson', 'keep', 'missing', 'other', 'life', 'begin', 'wonder', 'going', 'make', '30', 'ending', 'very', 'cheesy', 'poorly', 'done', 'not', 'mention', 'kind', 'abrupt', 'were', 'strick', 'time', 'should', 'have', 'cut', 'bar', 'scene', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'added', 'more', 'ending', 'greater', 'emotional', 'impact.All', 'not', 'bad', 'few', 'moments', 'spiritual', 'bliss', 'felt', 'watching', 'film', 'not', 'enough', 'place', 'same', 'level', 'Chances', 'Are', 'Defending', 'Life', 'potential', 'was', 'definitely', 'there', 'was', 'squandered', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'characters', 'marginal', 'acting', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'cheesy', 'scenes', 'want', 'real', 'spiritual', 'experience', 'heaven', 'suggest', 'reading', 'novel', 'What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'not', 'film', 'version', 'will', 'really', 'blow', 'away', 'details', 'what', 'might', 'expect', 'afterlife', 'experience']",N/A
