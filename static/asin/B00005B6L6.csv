580525,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B00005B6L6,Artist & Author,"[6, 6]","This movie works for families interested in movies depicting traditional family values because Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, as the grandparents, show so much love for each other, their orphaned grandson, and others.  Young Jason has a double role - on one hand he is the catalyst that helps their grandson get past his grieving; on the other, he reminds Mack of an incident predicated on racism but in reality was just plain bullying.[It also helped (for me, as a childhood fan of the 1950's Chicago cubs) that the great Ernie Banks was Mack's old friend.  All the boys on our old Little League team dreamed of playing baseball like Mr. Banks!]This is a wonderful family movie about baseball, boys, facing the past, sticking with one's ""gut feeling"" and learning the facts, consideration (and the lack of it for some) for other people's feelings, history of racism and for learning some baseball history.  If you have Little League age boys or girls, you can safely watch this movie without fear of violating any traditional family values.",5,A Wonderful Little League story,1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,1036,"['movie', 'families', 'interested', 'movies', 'depicting', 'traditional', 'family', 'values', 'Ossie', 'Davis', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'grandparents', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'other', 'orphaned', 'grandson', 'others', 'Young', 'Jason', 'double', 'role', 'one', 'hand', 'catalyst', 'grandson', 'get', 'grieving', 'other', 'Mack', 'incident', 'predicated', 'racism', 'reality', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'bullying', '[', 'also', 'helped', 'childhood', 'fan', '1950', 'Chicago', 'cubs', 'great', 'Ernie', 'Banks', 'was', 'Mack', 'old', 'friend', 'boys', 'old', 'Little', 'League', 'team', 'dreamed', 'playing', 'baseball', 'Mr', 'Banks', ']', 'wonderful', 'family', 'movie', 'baseball', 'boys', 'facing', 'past', 'sticking', 'one', 'gut', 'feeling', 'learning', 'facts', 'consideration', 'lack', 'other', 'people', 'feelings', 'history', 'racism', 'learning', 'baseball', 'history', 'have', 'Little', 'League', 'age', 'girls', 'can', 'safely', 'watch', 'movie', 'fear', 'violating', 'traditional', 'family', 'values']",N/A

When cut from his team because of his lack of skills and offered a chance to play on another one, Jason goes all out to prove himself. The man who is the key to his dream is a Black janitor by the name of Mack Henry, who knows a few things about baseball.Mack Henry is far more than a janitor. His knowledge of the game and stories about the Negro League opens up a new world for the young white boy. His obsession with the game leads him to find out about a player of the Negro Leagues called Buck McHenry. Are Buck and Mack the same person? Jason is convinced that they are and sets out to prove it.This sentimental tale introduces us to the players of the Negro League and highlights the contributions of those men who never had the opportunity to play the majors. You learn about their hardships and dangers they faced. You will see why Buck disappeared after three years of playing never to be seen again.What makes this picture interesting is the dynamics of a boy learning that it takes more than dreams to become a baseball player. It takes hard work. The video also shows how the media will invade a person's privacy for a good story regardless of the harm that it might cause. Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee star in this film as a couple who have loved one another for years but sorrow and a secret has entered their lives. Jason's curiousity brings shakes these things lose and Mack Henry's life will never be the same again.",3,UNRAVELING A MYSTERY,1048809600,"03 28, 2003",2003,1473,"['Jason', 'adolescent', 'filled', 'dreams', 'When', 'cut', 'team', 'lack', 'skills', 'offered', 'chance', 'play', 'one', 'Jason', 'prove', 'man', 'who', 'key', 'dream', 'Black', 'janitor', 'name', 'Mack', 'Henry', 'who', 'few', 'things', 'baseball.Mack', 'Henry', 'far', 'more', 'janitor', 'knowledge', 'game', 'stories', 'Negro', 'League', 'up', 'new', 'world', 'young', 'white', 'boy', 'obsession', 'game', 'find', 'out', 'player', 'Negro', 'Leagues', 'called', 'Buck', 'McHenry', 'Are', 'Buck', 'Mack', 'same', 'person', 'Jason', 'convinced', 'are', 'sets', 'out', 'prove', 'it.This', 'sentimental', 'tale', 'introduces', 'players', 'Negro', 'League', 'highlights', 'contributions', 'men', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'opportunity', 'play', 'majors', 'learn', 'hardships', 'dangers', 'faced', 'will', 'see', 'why', 'Buck', 'disappeared', 'three', 'years', 'playing', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'picture', 'interesting', 'dynamics', 'boy', 'learning', 'more', 'dreams', 'become', 'baseball', 'player', 'hard', 'work', 'video', 'also', 'how', 'media', 'will', 'invade', 'person', 'privacy', 'good', 'story', 'regardless', 'harm', 'might', 'cause', 'Ossie', 'Davis', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'star', 'film', 'couple', 'who', 'have', 'loved', 'one', 'years', 'sorrow', 'secret', 'entered', 'lives', 'Jason', 'curiousity', 'things', 'lose', 'Mack', 'Henry', 'life', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'again']",N/A
580527,A3MNJL4ROH6LRW,B00005B6L6,Don R. Holloway,"[1, 1]","I found this film to be entertaining as well as educational. In short, it is about a little league baseball player who thinks he knows everything about baseball until he is introduced to the world of the old Negro Leagues by the school janitor who seems to know a lot about those early black players. When the little leaguer, Jason, begins to research these early Negro Leagues, he becomes convinced that the school janitor--Mack Henry--is really a  once famous black player named Buck McHenry. So he sets out to prove his theory, even though Mack, the janitor, tells him he had best leave the past alone.Michael Schiffman plays the little leaguer, Jason, with great skill and a real passion that makes him a joy to watch. And the great Ossie Davis delivers a truly standout performance as Mack. Also, the sweet-faced Duane McLaughlin complements both actors with his alternate sadness over the recent loss of his parents and his joy and love for the game, and for his Grandpa Mack.I hope you will watch this movie. You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy it. This is truly a movie for all ages because it is about relationships and love and dreams.

It is attempting to educate about the Negro Leagues, and it has Ernie Banks in it. ""Finding Buck McHenry"" is an example of how good intentions are not enough. It is also an example of how it isn't enough for a movie to not have certain elements. This movie doesn't offend, but it has a clunky screenplay and almost none of the relationships are believable. For example, Buck McHenry is so frightened by what happened 40 years previously that he hides out as a janitor and doesn't even tell his own wife who he is. Yet, the name he chooses to go by is Mack Henry. The movie ends with the great Ernie Banks saying,""Buck! Mack!"" over and over. Not exactly ""It is a far, far better thing I do..."" kind of stuff. Having said all that, the acting of Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee is a highlight.
