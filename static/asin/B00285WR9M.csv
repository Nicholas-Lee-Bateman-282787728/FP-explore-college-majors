1255173,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00285WR9M,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 6]","This film, ""The Baader-Meinhof Complex"", is based on a novelistic treatment of the, sometimes, heroic exploits of the 1960s radical Germany group, the Baader-Meinhof Group (aka Red Army Faction, RAF), that, like a number of other such formations at that time, such as the the Weathermen in the United States, set out to form guerrilla organizations in order to fight imperialism. That of their own state, as with the Weathermen, or others, or to act as a ""second front"" in order to assist the Vietnamese in their struggle against American imperialism.Just before I watched this film I watched and reviewed, ""Salt Of The Earth"". That latter film presented a very different view, one that involved getting working and other oppressed peoples to organize themselves in mass action in the struggle against the bosses, a view more in tune with my own understanding of political organizing for radical social change. A way that in the long haul would prove, I think, to be more effective in the fight against international capitalism that the actions of RAF-type guerrilla formations. Nothing in this film, other than a sneaking admiration for the willingness of these fighters to sacrifice their lives for the struggle, has moved me from that earlier conviction.And that, my friends is the most graphic comparison that I can make about the fate of those, mainly, student radicals that went up against the German state in a more protracted struggle than here in the United States, and lost. Throughout the viewing of the film I kept getting the feeling that these fighters were talking to themselves in a vacuum. That the mere fact of being willing to fight, and to die, for the cause of the oppressed was enough to validate their positions and their strategies. And as the story unfolds I kept getting the feeling that I had been here before. And I had. In previous reviews of the actions of the Weathermen and of other armed struggle, substitutionist radical student-based formations that dotted the left-wing political landscape in the 1960s and the early 1970s. Off this viewing I would note though that the RAF seemed to be a much more serious and committed organization, at least before its original cadre were taken off the scene and out of day-to-day leadership, one way or another, by the West German security apparatus and their international allies.An American communist revolutionary that I greatly admire, James P. Cannon, an old Wobblie, founder of the American Communist party and founder of the American Trotskyist movement, once noted that if you get a small group of radical political people in a room and keep them there long enough anything is bound to happen. And that is exactly what happened here. The script could have almost been something out of Dostoevsky's ""The Possessed"", with a few modern technological updates. And this in a country, Germany, that had a long traditional of radical action, including a not unheroic communist past, had a vibrant and wide-spread student movement in the 1960s and, most importantly, an organized working class chafing under a bureaucratic Social Democratic Party leadership that needed to be replaced.So what does the Red Army faction do- starts an urban guerrilla campaign based on expropriations and acts of selected terror. Now, let us be clear most of the actions of the RAF, especially those aimed directly at the American military presence in Germany were defensible, as was the organization itself when confronted by the German state. The political differences over strategy, here the effectiveness of an intellectual elite-led urban guerrilla warfare not based on mass support against a modern industrial state, are what separate us, at it did with the Weathermen. However, the weakness of such a strategy got confirmed, intentionally or not, as the leaders and rank and file members got rather easily picked up, picked off, placed in jail, and placed on trial. In the end, with not way out, the isolated original leadership is forced to acts of suicide. In a sense, what we are witnessing unfold is the turn from a heroic guerrilla formation to a class war political defense organization. That scenario too is familiar from the old Black Panther days here in America.This is a film to watch, however, whatever the intentions of the director and producers as to the lessons to be drawn. If the strategy of urban guerrilla warfare ever seriously resurfaces in the West just drag out this film to clear the air. And then have your contacts watch that ""Salt Of The Earth"" that I mentioned before.",5,The Streets Are  Not for Dreaming Now,1273881600,"05 15, 2010",2010,4558,"['film', 'Baader-Meinhof', 'Complex', 'based', 'novelistic', 'treatment', 'sometimes', 'heroic', 'exploits', '1960s', 'radical', 'Germany', 'group', 'Baader-Meinhof', 'Group', 'aka', 'Red', 'Army', 'Faction', 'RAF', 'number', 'other', 'such', 'formations', 'time', 'such', 'Weathermen', 'United', 'States', 'set', 'out', 'form', 'guerrilla', 'organizations', 'order', 'fight', 'imperialism', 'own', 'state', 'Weathermen', 'others', 'act', 'second', 'front', 'order', 'assist', 'Vietnamese', 'struggle', 'American', 'imperialism.Just', 'watched', 'film', 'watched', 'reviewed', 'Salt', 'Earth', 'latter', 'film', 'presented', 'very', 'different', 'view', 'one', 'involved', 'getting', 'working', 'other', 'oppressed', 'peoples', 'organize', 'mass', 'action', 'struggle', 'bosses', 'view', 'more', 'tune', 'own', 'understanding', 'political', 'organizing', 'radical', 'social', 'change', 'way', 'long', 'haul', 'would', 'prove', 'think', 'be', 'more', 'effective', 'fight', 'international', 'capitalism', 'actions', 'RAF-type', 'guerrilla', 'formations', 'Nothing', 'film', 'other', 'sneaking', 'admiration', 'willingness', 'fighters', 'sacrifice', 'lives', 'struggle', 'moved', 'earlier', 'conviction.And', 'friends', 'most', 'graphic', 'comparison', 'can', 'make', 'fate', 'mainly', 'student', 'radicals', 'went', 'up', 'German', 'state', 'more', 'protracted', 'struggle', 'here', 'United', 'States', 'lost', 'viewing', 'film', 'kept', 'getting', 'feeling', 'fighters', 'were', 'talking', 'vacuum', 'mere', 'fact', 'being', 'willing', 'fight', 'die', 'cause', 'oppressed', 'was', 'enough', 'validate', 'positions', 'strategies', 'story', 'kept', 'getting', 'feeling', 'had', 'been', 'here', 'before', 'had', 'previous', 'reviews', 'actions', 'Weathermen', 'other', 'armed', 'struggle', 'substitutionist', 'radical', 'student-based', 'formations', 'dotted', 'left-wing', 'political', 'landscape', '1960s', 'early', '1970s', 'viewing', 'would', 'note', 'RAF', 'seemed', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'committed', 'organization', 'least', 'original', 'cadre', 'were', 'taken', 'off', 'scene', 'day-to-day', 'leadership', 'one', 'way', 'West', 'German', 'security', 'apparatus', 'international', 'allies.An', 'American', 'communist', 'revolutionary', 'greatly', 'admire', 'James', 'P.', 'Cannon', 'old', 'Wobblie', 'founder', 'American', 'Communist', 'party', 'founder', 'American', 'Trotskyist', 'movement', 'once', 'noted', 'get', 'small', 'group', 'radical', 'political', 'people', 'room', 'keep', 'there', 'long', 'enough', 'anything', 'bound', 'happen', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'here', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'almost', 'been', 'something', 'Dostoevsky', 'Possessed', 'few', 'modern', 'technological', 'updates', 'country', 'Germany', 'had', 'long', 'traditional', 'radical', 'action', 'including', 'not', 'unheroic', 'communist', 'past', 'had', 'vibrant', 'wide-spread', 'student', 'movement', '1960s', 'most', 'importantly', 'organized', 'working', 'class', 'chafing', 'bureaucratic', 'Social', 'Democratic', 'Party', 'leadership', 'needed', 'be', 'replaced.So', 'what', 'Red', 'Army', 'faction', 'do-', 'urban', 'guerrilla', 'campaign', 'based', 'expropriations', 'acts', 'selected', 'terror', 'Now', 'let', 'be', 'clear', 'most', 'actions', 'RAF', 'especially', 'aimed', 'directly', 'American', 'military', 'presence', 'Germany', 'were', 'defensible', 'was', 'organization', 'when', 'confronted', 'German', 'state', 'political', 'differences', 'strategy', 'here', 'effectiveness', 'intellectual', 'elite-led', 'urban', 'guerrilla', 'warfare', 'not', 'based', 'mass', 'support', 'modern', 'industrial', 'state', 'are', 'what', 'separate', 'did', 'Weathermen', 'However', 'weakness', 'such', 'strategy', 'got', 'confirmed', 'intentionally', 'not', 'leaders', 'rank', 'file', 'members', 'got', 'rather', 'easily', 'picked', 'up', 'picked', 'off', 'placed', 'jail', 'placed', 'trial', 'end', 'not', 'way', 'isolated', 'original', 'leadership', 'forced', 'acts', 'suicide', 'sense', 'what', 'are', 'witnessing', 'unfold', 'turn', 'heroic', 'guerrilla', 'formation', 'class', 'war', 'political', 'defense', 'organization', 'scenario', 'too', 'familiar', 'old', 'Black', 'Panther', 'days', 'here', 'America.This', 'film', 'watch', 'however', 'intentions', 'director', 'producers', 'lessons', 'be', 'drawn', 'strategy', 'urban', 'guerrilla', 'warfare', 'ever', 'seriously', 'resurfaces', 'West', 'just', 'out', 'film', 'clear', 'air', 'then', 'have', 'contacts', 'watch', 'Salt', 'Earth', 'mentioned']",The Baader Meinhof Complex [Region 2]

The early demonstration features a level of police violence that makes the Chicago 1968 police look like lambs, and that causes me to question its accuracy. Violence like that doesn't typically come out of a clear blue sky, but is the result of a certain relationship between demonstrators and police that I didn't see reflected in the movie -- there would have to be more demonstrators throwing rocks, for example, and more police being injured. At least, that's what I think, having been involved in a similar scale action at around the same time in San Diego.The movie seems to be trying to imply that the level of violence in that demonstration inspired groups to be radicalized, thus igniting the movement. I doubt it. Be that as it may, this is an incredible look at something that in general went much further beyond what happened in the US than I realized, and I highly recommend it. The acting was superb; the woman with the lead role was extremely believable as a monomaniacal and charismatic fanatic. The back-seat despair of the women when the guys stampeded around in ill-considered actions was dead realistic. The way action inevitably became more violent than the plans was sickeningly predictable.The leeway that the prisoners had while on trial and their palatial jail cells were hard to believe.

1255176,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B00285WR9M,Andres C. Salama,"[1, 1]","A very interesting movie about the Baader Meinhof Gang (or the Red Army Faction as they called themselves), a German extreme left terror group which killed dozens of people in the 1970s, basically, policemen and businessmen. The RAF was a small group of young people who have cut their teeth in the student protests of the late 1960s and who become radicalized a few years later. Though it had few members (at its heyday, it has less than a hundred members) it commanded some moral support from intellectuals and students. It remains something of a mystery what turned some of the young people of Germany in the 1970s (then, like now, among the wealthiest nations in Earth) into the path of political violence (just like we still wonder what turn the Germans to the Nazis in the 1930s). In part, as the movie shows, it was a reaction to the violence unleashed by the US towards the Vietnamese people in the Vietnam war. But the film also suggests that some of them were also spoiled and politically very naive. It is striking that in few others Western countries we saw the rise of such violent groups in that era. In a review, Christopher Hitchens thoughtfully noted that the three western countries where there were violent terror groups in the 1970s were Germany, Italy and Japan - perhaps not by chance, the three members of the Axis. Maybe, he hipothesizes, these militants were trying to show that they could react against authority in a way that their parents didn't a generation back.Starting with an amusing and somewhat shocking intro in a nudist beach (which in many countries it could not have been filmed for legal reasons), this film was made by writer-producer team that made Downfall. Perhaps not by chance Bruno Ganz appears here as a security chief whose role is to combat from the shadows the Red Army Faction. When Ganz appears, I couldn't help but remember his brilliant performance of the Fuhrer in that great film (other actors of that movie also appear in bits; Ganz top aide, for example, is played by Heino Ferch, who was Albert Speer in Downfall). There are fine performances all around. One of the terrorist leaders (a former journalist and the less fanatic of the leadership trio) is played by the actress who played the troubled wife of the playwright in the Lives of Others. Long but rewarding, the filmmakers, as they shown in Downfall, clearly know how to make an interesting, intelligent and entertaining film out of the controversial past.I read that some relatives of the victims of RAF's violence complained that the movie was biased towards the terrorists, but I found that it was in fact quite critical towards them. I would probably have changed the finale, though (and why not show, like in Downfall, what happened to the different characters in real life after the events depicted here).",4,Intelligent and Interesting,1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,2829,"['very', 'interesting', 'movie', 'Baader', 'Meinhof', 'Gang', 'Red', 'Army', 'Faction', 'called', 'German', 'extreme', 'left', 'terror', 'group', 'killed', 'dozens', 'people', '1970s', 'basically', 'policemen', 'businessmen', 'RAF', 'was', 'small', 'group', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'cut', 'teeth', 'student', 'protests', 'late', '1960s', 'who', 'become', 'radicalized', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'had', 'few', 'members', 'heyday', 'less', 'hundred', 'members', 'commanded', 'moral', 'support', 'intellectuals', 'students', 'something', 'mystery', 'what', 'turned', 'young', 'people', 'Germany', '1970s', 'then', 'now', 'wealthiest', 'nations', 'Earth', 'path', 'political', 'violence', 'just', 'still', 'wonder', 'what', 'turn', 'Germans', 'Nazis', '1930s', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'reaction', 'violence', 'unleashed', 'US', 'Vietnamese', 'people', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'film', 'also', 'were', 'also', 'spoiled', 'politically', 'very', 'naive', 'striking', 'few', 'others', 'Western', 'countries', 'saw', 'rise', 'such', 'violent', 'groups', 'era', 'review', 'Christopher', 'Hitchens', 'thoughtfully', 'noted', 'three', 'western', 'countries', 'where', 'were', 'violent', 'terror', 'groups', '1970s', 'were', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Japan', 'perhaps', 'not', 'chance', 'three', 'members', 'Axis', 'Maybe', 'militants', 'were', 'trying', 'show', 'could', 'react', 'authority', 'way', 'parents', 'did', ""n't"", 'generation', 'back.Starting', 'amusing', 'somewhat', 'shocking', 'intro', 'nudist', 'beach', 'many', 'countries', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'legal', 'reasons', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'writer-producer', 'team', 'made', 'Downfall', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'chance', 'Bruno', 'Ganz', 'here', 'security', 'chief', 'role', 'combat', 'shadows', 'Red', 'Army', 'Faction', 'When', 'Ganz', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'remember', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Fuhrer', 'great', 'film', 'other', 'actors', 'movie', 'also', 'appear', 'bits', 'Ganz', 'top', 'aide', 'example', 'played', 'Heino', 'Ferch', 'who', 'was', 'Albert', 'Speer', 'Downfall', 'are', 'fine', 'performances', 'around', 'One', 'terrorist', 'leaders', 'former', 'journalist', 'less', 'fanatic', 'leadership', 'trio', 'played', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'troubled', 'wife', 'playwright', 'Lives', 'Others', 'Long', 'rewarding', 'filmmakers', 'shown', 'Downfall', 'clearly', 'know', 'how', 'make', 'interesting', 'intelligent', 'entertaining', 'film', 'controversial', 'past.I', 'read', 'relatives', 'victims', 'RAF', 'violence', 'complained', 'movie', 'was', 'biased', 'terrorists', 'found', 'was', 'fact', 'quite', 'critical', 'towards', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'changed', 'finale', 'why', 'not', 'show', 'Downfall', 'what', 'happened', 'different', 'characters', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'depicted', 'here']",The Baader Meinhof Complex [Region 2]

What I like about the film is its depiction of how utterly vapid these ""revolutionaries"" were, and how much radical terrorism is really a nexus of patchwork politics married to the simple adrenaline thrills of delinquency and crime.  Andreas Baader was a punk, pure and simple.  His girlfriend Gudren Eisslen seems to be a  middle-class brat working out her ""daddy issues"" through the endless prattle of revolutionary rhetoric.  Ulrike Meinhof was a leftist journalist opting out of Fraudom by joining with these losers and becoming their self-justifying voice.  None of this would matter, except they murdered real people and were the inspiration for other like-minded malcontents who went on to do the same.  They were celebrated by the radical chic crowd of the time, and the myth surrounding them needs to be examined and debunked, as it is to some extent in this film.  Then they need to be exiled to a tiny historical footnote and forgotten.The thing often missed about radicals is that they are insufferable bores.  Narrow-minded, egotistical and self-aggrandizing, dysfunctional and generally unhappy and pathetic people they create a romantic fantasy about revolution that is a perfect rationalization for psychopathy.  What can you say about people who want to save the world by blowing it up?  Well you can say we are living with the ultimate expression of that now with radical Islam, and ain't that fun?  This pack of worthless individuals in the Germany of the 1970's were the terrorists of their day.  Debated and discussed, exhalted or excoriated in the media, a source of fascination to youths disenchanted with the monotonous bourgeoise success and conformity of post-war Germany. In short, adolescents.  And so much of the radicalism of that time was simply adolescent cheap thrills and a way to get laid.The filmmakers, old leftist themselves who haven't completely come to terms with their own enrapture of that era but middle- aged and reflective now, have caught the feeling of the time, and their depiction of the ""banality of evil"" that is the ultimate pronouncement on the meaning of the Baader-Meinhof Gang is revealing not only of this group at this time, but the current crop of radicals amongst us today.  By and large they make a lot of noise, accomplish little, and you would be hard pressed to want to spend an afternoon with any of them.  They themselves are forgettable, unfortunately their crimes cannot be for the suffering they inflict is all too real.

This was never more true than with the Baadermeinhof, one of the most infamous terrorists groups to ever plague the free world.'Der Baadermeinhof Komplex' takes us inside the action by telling the story from the Baadermeinhof's point of view. Great acting and great production quality, the movie is a fast paced historical thriller from beginning to end. The story and acting are so powerful subtitles are not even required to follow the film.The film is very historically accurate. Although it is seen through the eyes of the Baadermeinhof it is in no way sympathetic towards them. It accurately details their appalling crimes targeting civilians such as fire bombings, bank robberies, murdering cops and politicians' families.The saga begins in 1970 West Germany where 60s radicals are protesting the Vietnam War, Israel, democracy, ecedra. Instead of moving to communist East Germany they form the RAF, Red Army Faction and begin targeting German civilians with fire bombs and murder. They even travel to Jordan to train and conspire with the infamous Black September terrorists whom later committed the Munich massacre at the 1972 Olympics.The RAF's crimes continue to escalate in scale and profile. They target politicians and their families for assassination and begin taking hostages. Most notably the the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes, the hijacking of airliners, and the Stockholm hostage crisis.The saga continues through the Baadermeinhof's eventual capture, imprisonment and trial which they use as a speaking platform. The film ends with their deaths still awaiting trial. Assassinated by Israel's Mossad. They were really upset about the Munich massacre.The film really gets to the heart of what terrorism is. Do these thugs actually expect that by murdering civilians the US will simply pull out of Vietnam? That Israelis will simply leave the Middle East forever? That West Germany will go communist? Yes they do. In their warped minds murder will achieve their goals. That's terrorism.Like all terrorists they do win in the sense that the government acknowledges that the Baadermeinhof are not organized criminals like the Mafia to be dealt with by the police but ""terrorists."" Enemy combatants who must be treated like an enemy government and army.I also highly recommend the films:'One Day in September''21 Hours in Munich''Munich'",5,Cold Warrior Thriller,1271116800,"04 13, 2010",2010,2431,"['Cold', 'Warrior', 'ThrillerA', 'communist', 'definition', 'mentally', 'defective', 'was', 'never', 'more', 'true', 'Baadermeinhof', 'one', 'most', 'infamous', 'terrorists', 'groups', 'ever', 'plague', 'free', 'world', 'Baadermeinhof', 'Komplex', 'action', 'telling', 'story', 'Baadermeinhof', 'point', 'view', 'Great', 'acting', 'great', 'production', 'quality', 'movie', 'fast', 'paced', 'historical', 'thriller', 'beginning', 'end', 'story', 'acting', 'are', 'so', 'powerful', 'subtitles', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'required', 'follow', 'film.The', 'film', 'very', 'historically', 'accurate', 'seen', 'eyes', 'Baadermeinhof', 'way', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'accurately', 'details', 'appalling', 'crimes', 'targeting', 'civilians', 'such', 'fire', 'bombings', 'bank', 'robberies', 'murdering', 'cops', 'politicians', 'families.The', 'saga', '1970', 'West', 'Germany', 'where', '60s', 'radicals', 'are', 'protesting', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'Israel', 'democracy', 'ecedra', 'Instead', 'moving', 'communist', 'East', 'Germany', 'form', 'RAF', 'Red', 'Army', 'Faction', 'begin', 'targeting', 'German', 'civilians', 'fire', 'bombs', 'murder', 'even', 'travel', 'Jordan', 'train', 'conspire', 'infamous', 'Black', 'September', 'whom', 'later', 'committed', 'Munich', 'massacre', '1972', 'Olympics.The', 'RAF', 'crimes', 'continue', 'escalate', 'scale', 'profile', 'target', 'politicians', 'families', 'assassination', 'begin', 'taking', 'hostages', 'Most', 'notably', '1972', 'Munich', 'massacre', 'Israeli', 'athletes', 'hijacking', 'airliners', 'Stockholm', 'hostage', 'crisis.The', 'saga', 'Baadermeinhof', 'eventual', 'capture', 'imprisonment', 'trial', 'use', 'speaking', 'platform', 'film', 'deaths', 'still', 'awaiting', 'trial', 'Assassinated', 'Israel', 'Mossad', 'were', 'really', 'upset', 'Munich', 'massacre.The', 'film', 'really', 'heart', 'what', 'terrorism', 'Do', 'thugs', 'actually', 'expect', 'murdering', 'civilians', 'US', 'will', 'simply', 'pull', 'Vietnam', 'Israelis', 'will', 'simply', 'leave', 'Middle', 'East', 'forever', 'West', 'Germany', 'will', 'go', 'communist', 'Yes', 'do', 'warped', 'minds', 'murder', 'will', 'achieve', 'goals', 'terrorists', 'do', 'win', 'sense', 'government', 'Baadermeinhof', 'are', 'not', 'organized', 'criminals', 'Mafia', 'be', 'dealt', 'police', 'terrorists', 'Enemy', 'combatants', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'treated', 'enemy', 'government', 'army.I', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'films', ""'One"", 'Day', 'September', '21', 'Hours', 'Munich', 'Munich']",The Baader Meinhof Complex [Region 2]

As a military brat we were in fear of this group, as both Frankfurt and Ramstein experienced terrorist attacks by this group.The news clips that were used in this movie are genuine.  I remember that old man on the German news.  The terror lasted all through the 1970s.It was therefore haunting to see this movie again.  All the actors were so believable as their actual characters they were playing.  Watch the 30-minute ""Making of the B-M Complex"" and you will learn that the director, Uli Edel, used all genuine parts, even using the actual court hall of the prison in which the real terrorists were interviewed (and denied) parole.  The prison cells were designed according to old photographs of the real prison cells, down to genuine sinks.  The actors spent endless hours studying the mannerisms and speech patterns of their roles.  Actor Martina Gedeck almost looks like the younger sister of Gudrun Ensslin, the ""brains"" behind this group of misfits.I didn't read the book; my opinions are based on memory.  The scenes in this movie are non-stop action and at times overly graphic in their violence, but this is how B-M acted.  Even how the group slowly fell apart due to newer generations of this group not being in sinc with the original founders, is quite obvious.  The Baader-Meinhof gang was a group of highly intellectual but badly misguided and violent group of extreme-left-leaning students whose guilt of their parents perhaps got the ball rolling.Say what you may, ""This is part of our History"" said Edel, and this movie shows this history well.

1255184,A2S3ZLA5CZU4Q7,B00285WR9M,C. L. Messina,"[2, 2]","I'd heard about the 'discotech' bombings in Berlin, terrorists hijacking planes and the like coming out of Germany but this was one generation removed from me and nearing the end of the fight, so to speak. The bigger issue my generation saw was the fall of the Berlin wall and dissolution of the Soviet Union. So what was all that German/PLO terrorist stuff in the 70's about? This movie is your answer and actually speaks about many global issues we see today. It's prophetic in a sense.It's difficult to succintly describe this movie without missing quite a bit of context and trivializing viewpoints, so some quick facts. A group of German left-wing young adults attack objects, human and structural, which they view as suppressive representations of Western Capitalism. People die on both sides. The group eventually looses its' leadership and fizzles out as its' ability to recruit willing participants becomes increasingly futile.To ask 'who's right' and 'who's wrong' is infantile, or as another writer once put so well, one person's freedom fighter is another persons terrorist. What makes this group seem so terroristic is the proximity and intimacy of the attacks. The dead have faces, families, lives and the movie never removes us as far as say a remote stealth drone bomber to think otherwise. I find it odd and unfortunate that those who decry the members of this group as cold-blooded murderers don't apply the same logic to government sponsored warfare and subversion. Make no mistake, the Baader-Meinhof group kill people with force, without hesitation and without regret. Neither means of taking human life (gov't or terrorist) are 'good', but what makes a shotgun blast by the RAF morally inferior to being burned alive in a napalm bombing? As this movie is a pretty accurate document of the events surrounding the Baader-Meinhof group, this question must certainly be considered by the viewer.It's easy to write the group off as brain-dead, leftist hippies with machine guns but the fact is they weren't. Most were college educated, many with advanced degrees and they worked with a political ideology as clear as any American founding father. And just like the founding fathers, most members had something to loose and chose to sacrifice that in the name of their cause, which takes us to the heart of this movie. What is the group's 'cause'?I believe their initial cause was reactionary and perhaps slightly petty but we cannot discount that reaction. Here are a group of very intelligent people whose prior generation were the cause and support everything we fought against in WWII. It's easy to forget that many German authority figures at the time escaped judgement and occupied  positions of power. We hear so much about youth believing they have good cause to not trust authority but rarely does one have as much material circumstances to support such a belief. Would you trust a government comprised of former Nazi's to be fair, impartial and working for the greater good of your own country? Add to that condition  the Communistic/Capitalistic struggle (i.e. Iron Curtain) and put well-meaning, idealistic, extremist kids right in the center of it all. Is it hard to imagine this kind of thing taking place? Again, I'm not saying the RAF was 'right' nor am I justifying their actions but one can't accuse them of simply being base, angry, pointless rebels.  I believe they represented questions we still struggle to answer- namely the first world's relationship with the third world.It's important to note that the group found support by pretty much everyone the US is currently in conflict with. A group of WESTERNERS were welcomed openly by 'the bad guys'. Perhaps the bad guys don't hate the West so much as it's popular political ideology. Certainly something to consider after watching this movie.There are numerous things I like about the movie- the cool retro style, the attention to detail, the editing and fast pace, the linear story, but most of all I loved the characters. If the real leadership of the RAF were anything like these portrayals then it can at least be said they never lacked charisma, which plays a very important role in the entire movement. Ideology can only take any group so far but what pushes it beyond are charismatic leaders. It doesn't seem too hard to imagine a leftist idealist being seduced by the RAF during the timeframe. And keep in mind that the group initially had a fair amount of public support. Andreas Baader (portrayed by Moritz Bleibtreu) and Gudrun Ensslin (portrayed by Johanna Wokalek) come off as German rock stars with machine guns. I can't help but think of them as a modern day Bonnie and Clyde. What is particularly interesting is how the two take advantage of the apologetic former German government's version of political correctness to bend the legal system to their will. Again, so many parallels with our modern world.And then the conclusion. The leadership is either murdered or commits suicide, you have to come to your own conclusion.  It's fair to say they were headed that way in a hurry from the start but it leaves one with the question of whether or not it was worth it. Did the RAF leadership waste their lives on a pointless cause or did it have meaning and impact? As much as I condone violence it's fair to say the government did recognize the group's potential for changing the political game. Perhaps if the RAF had greater political connections they might have been had the kind of say the IRA currently does in Ireland. Love them or hate them, paint them heroes or villians, the government DID listen to them more than they did to the protesters whom they summarily beat with night sticks.Incredible, must-see

1255185,A9NCQGVV5W8N0,B00285WR9M,"darklordzden ""darklordzden""","[55, 61]","West Germany, 1967: After a disastrous engagement between the federal republic of Germany's left wing student population and parties sympathetic to the visiting Shah of Iran degenerates into street violence and results in the firebombing of a department store and an assassination attempt on the life of socialist firebrand, Rudi Dutschke, a group of increasingly disaffected German students and petty criminals begin to coalesce around the magnetic personalities of malcontent street punk, Andreas Baader, and his girlfriend, Gudrun Ensslin. Amongst those caught in their gravity is middle-class, left-wing journalist and media personality, Ulrike Meinhof.  Baader and Ensslin have decided that politely protesting the policies of American and Israeli ""Imperialism"" with acts of civil disobedience is no longer enough and decide to engage in armed struggle against the constitutional powers of West Germany. Over the next ten years, the result of the alliance between Baader, Esselin and Meinhof, The `Red Army Faction' (aka the Baader-Meinhof Group), was to terrorise not only the FDR, but the governments and populations of countries far beyond it's borders.Attempting to relate the tale of the rise to prominence of the RAF, much less adapt Stefan Aust's incredibly convoluted door-stopper of a book, was, I suspected, going to be nigh-on impossible - but Uli Edel's film achieves this virtually impossible task with aplomb. As well as being one of the most impressive thrillers that I've seen in years, its also one of the most fascinating portraits of the corruption and degeneration of political idealism ever to make its way to screen.Performances are for the most part excellent and Moritz Bleibtreu perfectly embodies the essence of Aust's rendering of Baader - essentially a wayward, misogynistic hooligan who seemed more interested in playing with machine guns than liberating the ""oppressed of the world"". The yin to Bleibtreu's yang is Martina Gedeck's turn as Ulrike Meinhof: who appears to have been a cosseted champagne socialist who eventually became so misguided and so passionately committed to the struggle against ""oppression and imperialism"" that she was rather horrifyingly prepared to deliver her own children into a camp for Syrian orphans rather than see them raised under ""the yoke of imperialism"". There is a telling suggestion that the catalyst which may have precipitated the already fragile Meinhof's fall was the discovery of her husband's infidelity.From a directorial stance, Edel manages to pull off the difficult trick of observing both sides of the conflict without favouring either. His rendering of the government in the FDR in sixties is anything but nostalgic and seems to suggest that it was inevitable that a group such as the RAF would eventually arise from the formenting crucible of social, political and governmental dissatisfaction that prevailed at the time. On the reverse side of the coin however, it cannot be argued that his sympathies lie with his revolutionary protagonists either, as he is only too willing to clinically dissect their personal failings as well as the raving hypocrisy of their objectives and opinions.A fascinating portrait of an extreme group of misguided individuals living through the most turbulent period of the late twentieth century, ""The Baader Meinhof Complex"" is a fascinating study of personal obsession played out through political objectification and one of the best films that I've seen this year.Highly recommended.",5,A New Amorality,1254700800,"10 5, 2009",2009,3504,"['West', 'Germany', '1967', 'disastrous', 'engagement', 'federal', 'republic', 'Germany', 'left', 'wing', 'student', 'population', 'parties', 'sympathetic', 'visiting', 'Shah', 'Iran', 'street', 'violence', 'results', 'firebombing', 'department', 'store', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'life', 'socialist', 'firebrand', 'Rudi', 'Dutschke', 'group', 'increasingly', 'disaffected', 'German', 'students', 'petty', 'criminals', 'begin', 'coalesce', 'magnetic', 'personalities', 'malcontent', 'street', 'punk', 'Andreas', 'Baader', 'girlfriend', 'Gudrun', 'Ensslin', 'Amongst', 'caught', 'gravity', 'middle-class', 'left-wing', 'journalist', 'media', 'personality', 'Ulrike', 'Meinhof', 'Baader', 'Ensslin', 'have', 'decided', 'politely', 'protesting', 'policies', 'American', 'Israeli', 'Imperialism', 'acts', 'civil', 'disobedience', 'no', 'longer', 'enough', 'decide', 'engage', 'armed', 'struggle', 'constitutional', 'powers', 'West', 'Germany', 'next', 'ten', 'years', 'result', 'alliance', 'Baader', 'Esselin', 'Meinhof', 'Red', 'Army', 'Faction', 'Baader-Meinhof', 'Group', 'was', 'terrorise', 'not', 'only', 'FDR', 'governments', 'populations', 'countries', 'far', 'borders.Attempting', 'relate', 'tale', 'rise', 'prominence', 'RAF', 'much', 'less', 'adapt', 'Stefan', 'Aust', 'incredibly', 'convoluted', 'door-stopper', 'book', 'was', 'suspected', 'going', 'be', 'nigh-on', 'impossible', 'Uli', 'Edel', 'film', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'task', 'aplomb', 'As', 'well', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'thrillers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'portraits', 'corruption', 'degeneration', 'political', 'idealism', 'ever', 'make', 'way', 'screen.Performances', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'excellent', 'Moritz', 'Bleibtreu', 'perfectly', 'essence', 'Aust', 'rendering', 'Baader', 'essentially', 'wayward', 'misogynistic', 'hooligan', 'who', 'seemed', 'more', 'interested', 'playing', 'machine', 'guns', 'liberating', 'oppressed', 'world', 'yin', 'Bleibtreu', 'yang', 'Martina', 'Gedeck', 'turn', 'Ulrike', 'Meinhof', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'cosseted', 'champagne', 'socialist', 'who', 'eventually', 'became', 'so', 'misguided', 'so', 'passionately', 'committed', 'struggle', 'oppression', 'imperialism', 'was', 'rather', 'horrifyingly', 'prepared', 'deliver', 'own', 'children', 'camp', 'Syrian', 'orphans', 'rather', 'see', 'raised', 'yoke', 'imperialism', 'telling', 'suggestion', 'catalyst', 'may', 'have', 'precipitated', 'already', 'fragile', 'Meinhof', 'fall', 'was', 'discovery', 'husband', 'infidelity.From', 'directorial', 'stance', 'Edel', 'pull', 'off', 'difficult', 'trick', 'observing', 'sides', 'conflict', 'favouring', 'either', 'rendering', 'government', 'FDR', 'sixties', 'anything', 'nostalgic', 'suggest', 'was', 'inevitable', 'group', 'such', 'RAF', 'would', 'eventually', 'arise', 'formenting', 'crucible', 'social', 'political', 'governmental', 'dissatisfaction', 'prevailed', 'time', 'reverse', 'side', 'coin', 'however', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'argued', 'sympathies', 'lie', 'revolutionary', 'protagonists', 'either', 'only', 'too', 'willing', 'clinically', 'dissect', 'personal', 'failings', 'as', 'well', 'raving', 'hypocrisy', 'objectives', 'opinions.A', 'fascinating', 'portrait', 'extreme', 'group', 'misguided', 'individuals', 'living', 'most', 'turbulent', 'period', 'late', 'twentieth', 'century', 'Baader', 'Meinhof', 'Complex', 'fascinating', 'study', 'personal', 'obsession', 'played', 'out', 'political', 'objectification', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year.Highly', 'recommended']",The Baader Meinhof Complex [Region 2]
1255186,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B00285WR9M,D. Hartley,"[1, 1]","""The Baader-Meinhof Complex"" is a German political thriller that largely eschews the politics for the thrills, with nary a sympathetic character in sight. I feel sorry for writer-producer Bernd Eichinger and director Uli Edel. Marketing a film in this day and age that dutifully recreates a 10-year reign of terror by Germany's most notorious (and nihilistic) group of underground radicals has got to be a tough sell, no matter how honorable the intentions. Still, the truly objective viewer will find much to admire within this admittedly difficult 2  hour opus.What I found most exciting about this film were the three fearless and incendiary lead performances that lie at the heart of it. Martina Gedeck is a marvel as Ulrike Meinhof. Meinhof was a well-known left-wing journalist in the late 60s, when she first met radical activists Gudrun Ensslin (Johanna Wokalek) and Andreas Baader (Mortiz Bleibtreu). The couple had recently begun to make the transition from protest to action; their firebombing of a department store (in protest of the Vietnam War) made an impression on Mienhof, who was already toying with the idea of making that jump herself. Within a year of their first meeting, Meinhof was firmly in league with Baader and Ensslin, who all eventually would form the nucleus of the self-proclaimed ""Red Army Faction"". After a prison break in 1970 that freed Baader (who had earned a 3-year sentence for the department store arson) and a stint of military training in Jordan with El Fatah, the R.A.F.'s actions began to lead to an ever-increasing body count. This naturally precipitated intense pursuit by authorities, who had the three principals and most of their associates rounded up by 1972.Although the founding members were now incarcerated for good, there would still be another five years of activities by the R.A.F. Mark II- the so-called ""second generation"" of the organization; this period of their history (1973-1977) accounts for the final third of the film. It is this part of the story that I actually found most fascinating. This is because it demonstrates how (although doesn't necessarily go to any length to explore why) such radical groups inevitably seem to self-destruct by becoming a microcosm of the very thing they were railing against in the first place (in this case, disintegrating into a sort of self-imposed fascistic state that became more and more about internal power plays and individual egos instead of focusing on their original collective idealism). This aspect of the story strongly recalls the late German filmmaker Rainier Werner Fassbinder's 1979 political satire, cheekily entitled ""The Third Generation"", in which he carries the idea of an ongoing disconnect between the R.A.F.'s core ideals and what he portrays as little more than a group of increasingly clueless, bumbling middle-class dilettantes who bear scant resemblance to the original group of hardcore revolutionaries, to ridiculous extremes.This is not a film for everyone. The 150-minute running time will be daunting if you only have a passing interest in the subject matter. As I mentioned at the top of the review, this is not exactly a political film, per se. Screenwriter/producer Eichinger (who adapted from Stefan Aust's book of the same name) has stated that the intention was neither to make ""...a didactic film nor a modern morality play about German terrorism,"" but rather present events as they actually occurred, and allow the viewer to draw their own conclusion. I think they succeed in achieving this intended neutrality; it's a wise choice, because these are not easy (nor pleasant) characters to spend 2  hours with. If you find the story intriguing as socio-political history (and appreciate top-notch acting), I don't think you will be disappointed. If you want to see it strictly as an ""action"" thriller (it does have its fair share of such sequences) I suspect that you may be wanting to see it for all the wrong reasons.",5,Superbaad,1267315200,"02 28, 2010",2010,3962,"['Baader-Meinhof', 'Complex', 'German', 'political', 'thriller', 'largely', 'politics', 'thrills', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'sight', 'feel', 'sorry', 'writer-producer', 'Bernd', 'Eichinger', 'director', 'Uli', 'Edel', 'Marketing', 'film', 'day', 'age', 'dutifully', '10-year', 'reign', 'terror', 'Germany', 'most', 'notorious', 'nihilistic', 'group', 'underground', 'radicals', 'got', 'be', 'tough', 'sell', 'matter', 'how', 'honorable', 'intentions', 'Still', 'truly', 'objective', 'viewer', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'admire', 'admittedly', 'difficult', '2', 'hour', 'found', 'most', 'exciting', 'film', 'were', 'three', 'fearless', 'incendiary', 'lead', 'performances', 'lie', 'heart', 'Martina', 'Gedeck', 'marvel', 'Ulrike', 'Meinhof', 'Meinhof', 'was', 'well-known', 'left-wing', 'journalist', 'late', '60s', 'when', 'first', 'met', 'radical', 'activists', 'Gudrun', 'Ensslin', 'Johanna', 'Wokalek', 'Andreas', 'Baader', 'Mortiz', 'Bleibtreu', 'couple', 'had', 'recently', 'begun', 'make', 'transition', 'protest', 'action', 'firebombing', 'department', 'store', 'protest', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'made', 'impression', 'Mienhof', 'who', 'was', 'already', 'toying', 'idea', 'making', 'jump', 'year', 'first', 'meeting', 'Meinhof', 'was', 'firmly', 'league', 'Baader', 'Ensslin', 'who', 'eventually', 'would', 'form', 'nucleus', 'self-proclaimed', 'Red', 'Army', 'Faction', 'prison', 'break', '1970', 'freed', 'Baader', 'who', 'had', 'earned', '3-year', 'sentence', 'department', 'store', 'arson', 'stint', 'military', 'training', 'Jordan', 'El', 'Fatah', 'R.A.F', 'actions', 'began', 'lead', 'ever-increasing', 'body', 'count', 'naturally', 'precipitated', 'intense', 'pursuit', 'authorities', 'who', 'had', 'three', 'principals', 'most', 'associates', 'rounded', 'up', '1972.Although', 'founding', 'members', 'were', 'now', 'incarcerated', 'good', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'five', 'years', 'activities', 'R.A.F', 'Mark', 'II-', 'so-called', 'second', 'generation', 'organization', 'period', 'history', '1973-1977', 'accounts', 'final', 'third', 'film', 'part', 'story', 'actually', 'found', 'most', 'fascinating', 'how', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'go', 'length', 'explore', 'why', 'such', 'radical', 'groups', 'inevitably', 'seem', 'self-destruct', 'becoming', 'microcosm', 'very', 'thing', 'were', 'railing', 'first', 'place', 'case', 'disintegrating', 'sort', 'self-imposed', 'fascistic', 'state', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'internal', 'power', 'plays', 'individual', 'egos', 'instead', 'focusing', 'original', 'collective', 'idealism', 'aspect', 'story', 'strongly', 'late', 'German', 'filmmaker', 'Rainier', 'Werner', 'Fassbinder', '1979', 'political', 'satire', 'cheekily', 'entitled', 'Third', 'Generation', 'idea', 'ongoing', 'disconnect', 'R.A.F', 'core', 'ideals', 'what', 'as', 'little', 'more', 'group', 'increasingly', 'clueless', 'bumbling', 'middle-class', 'dilettantes', 'who', 'bear', 'scant', 'resemblance', 'original', 'group', 'hardcore', 'revolutionaries', 'ridiculous', 'extremes.This', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', '150-minute', 'running', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'daunting', 'only', 'have', 'passing', 'interest', 'subject', 'matter', 'mentioned', 'top', 'review', 'not', 'exactly', 'political', 'film', 'se', 'Screenwriter/producer', 'Eichinger', 'who', 'adapted', 'Stefan', 'Aust', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'stated', 'intention', 'was', 'make', 'didactic', 'film', 'modern', 'morality', 'play', 'German', 'terrorism', 'rather', 'present', 'events', 'actually', 'occurred', 'allow', 'viewer', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusion', 'think', 'succeed', 'achieving', 'intended', 'neutrality', 'wise', 'choice', 'are', 'not', 'easy', 'pleasant', 'characters', 'spend', '2', 'hours', 'find', 'story', 'intriguing', 'socio-political', 'history', 'appreciate', 'top-notch', 'acting', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'want', 'see', 'strictly', 'action', 'thriller', 'have', 'fair', 'share', 'such', 'sequences', 'suspect', 'may', 'be', 'wanting', 'see', 'wrong', 'reasons']",The Baader Meinhof Complex [Region 2]
1255187,A37GRFP6VMUXKT,B00285WR9M,"Douglas S. Wood ""Vicarious Life""","[6, 7]","The Baader Meinhof Complex marks another successful historical drama for the German film industry (afterThe Lives of Others, a superb film about the East German surveillance society,Downfall, an equally excellent portrayal of Hitler's last days, andSophie Scholl - The Final Days, a slightly less outstanding movie that tells the little known story of internal resistance to the Nazis).The film revisits the 1960s and 70s' and the notorious Red Army Faction led by Andreas Baader (played by Moritz Bleibtreu), his lover Gudrun Ensslin (Johanna Wokalek) and Ulrike Meinhof (Martina Gedeck, who also starred in The Lives of Others). The story begins to take shape when a protest of the Shah's visit in 1967 becomes the infamous June 2 police riot, which the film makers marvelously recreate. This event launches the journalist Meinhof on her journey to radicalism. Like their compatriots in other countries young Germans rebel against all forms of authority and protest against the Vietnam War. German youth had the added fuel of knowing that the generation of the authorities had failed to rebel against Hitler.The movie's pacing and focus on action keeps the viewer riveted as the Baader Meinhof group becomes increasingly radicalized. Bank holdups almost inevitably lead to violence. The violence leads to police reaction and repression. Eventually the leaders end up in prison. They see themselves as political prisoners, which is true to the extent that their crimes were politically motivated, but not in the sense that they imprisoned because of their political beliefs. Their primary focus then becomes to get the leaders out of prison and they pursue that end with increasingly desperate, not to say suicidal, actions (seizing the German embassy in Sweden and finally coordinating the hijacking of a Lufthansa plane with Palestinian extremists). The internal logic runs amuck.The movie initially evokes sympathy for most of the members (not Baader; he is portrayed as a homicidally-inclined authoritarian who has found a perfect bunch of new friends). The uptight establishment needed to be challenged, the War in Vietnam was wrong, the West did exploit the Third World (of course, so did the East). Their hedonism is appealing (not so much to their Arab associates). They were young, audacious, and beautiful (they weren't really that alluring were they?).But their politics and their political actions were ludicrous (not to say infantile). In this sense, they remind me of the Weather Underground. Baader Meinhof was more violent, more often, but just as detached from political reality. Neither organization had any mass base or posed any threat of revolution whatsoever, but they deluded themselves that they were doing something politically important. They were aided and abetted in this self-important view by the police (especially in the US) who reacted as if the groups were a serious threat to political stability. Both groups underestimated the ability and willingness of Western governments to adopt totalitarian tactics to destroy leftists who resorted to action in the street.I don't know whether the movie gives soft handling to the German police or not; maybe they really were more restrained than the infamous local US police and FBI `red squads'. The leader of the anti-radical unit (played by Bruno Ganz who played Hitler in Downfall) is portrayed as thoughtful and generally moderate, but the rank-and-file police are shown handing out beatings and the prisoners are subjected to lengthy terms of solitary confinement. But the movie does not pursue explore the possibility that government-paid agitators might have attained leadership positions (as they most certainly did in the US).Fortunately, the movie focuses on the action rather than the ideology (Mao is cited only once or twice). The film does not romanticize the revolutionaries nor does it expend energy trying to figure out the `why'; no navel-gazing or introspective brooding. But action was what Baader Meinhof was about, not reflecting on whether the action made any sense. The best thing that I can say about the movie is that it will help anyone over 50 explain the Sixties to their children and entertain as well.",5,A Window on Another Time,1267315200,"02 28, 2010",2010,4209,"['Baader', 'Meinhof', 'Complex', 'successful', 'historical', 'drama', 'German', 'film', 'industry', 'afterThe', 'Lives', 'Others', 'superb', 'film', 'East', 'German', 'surveillance', 'society', 'Downfall', 'equally', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'Hitler', 'last', 'days', 'andSophie', 'Scholl', 'Final', 'Days', 'slightly', 'less', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'little', 'known', 'story', 'internal', 'resistance', 'Nazis', '.The', 'film', '1960s', '70s', 'notorious', 'Red', 'Army', 'Faction', 'led', 'Andreas', 'Baader', 'played', 'Moritz', 'Bleibtreu', 'lover', 'Gudrun', 'Ensslin', 'Johanna', 'Wokalek', 'Ulrike', 'Meinhof', 'Martina', 'Gedeck', 'who', 'also', 'starred', 'Lives', 'Others', 'story', 'take', 'shape', 'when', 'protest', 'Shah', 'visit', '1967', 'infamous', 'June', '2', 'police', 'riot', 'film', 'makers', 'marvelously', 'recreate', 'event', 'journalist', 'Meinhof', 'journey', 'radicalism', 'compatriots', 'other', 'countries', 'young', 'Germans', 'rebel', 'forms', 'authority', 'protest', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'German', 'youth', 'had', 'added', 'fuel', 'knowing', 'generation', 'authorities', 'had', 'failed', 'rebel', 'Hitler.The', 'movie', 'pacing', 'focus', 'action', 'viewer', 'riveted', 'Baader', 'Meinhof', 'group', 'increasingly', 'radicalized', 'Bank', 'holdups', 'almost', 'inevitably', 'lead', 'violence', 'violence', 'police', 'reaction', 'repression', 'Eventually', 'leaders', 'end', 'up', 'prison', 'see', 'political', 'prisoners', 'true', 'extent', 'crimes', 'were', 'politically', 'motivated', 'not', 'sense', 'imprisoned', 'political', 'beliefs', 'primary', 'focus', 'then', 'get', 'leaders', 'prison', 'pursue', 'end', 'increasingly', 'desperate', 'not', 'say', 'suicidal', 'actions', 'seizing', 'German', 'embassy', 'Sweden', 'finally', 'coordinating', 'hijacking', 'Lufthansa', 'plane', 'Palestinian', 'extremists', 'internal', 'logic', 'amuck.The', 'movie', 'initially', 'sympathy', 'most', 'members', 'not', 'Baader', 'portrayed', 'homicidally-inclined', 'authoritarian', 'who', 'found', 'perfect', 'bunch', 'new', 'friends', 'uptight', 'establishment', 'needed', 'be', 'challenged', 'War', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'wrong', 'West', 'did', 'exploit', 'Third', 'World', 'course', 'so', 'did', 'East', 'hedonism', 'appealing', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Arab', 'associates', 'were', 'young', 'audacious', 'beautiful', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'alluring', 'were', '.But', 'politics', 'political', 'actions', 'were', 'ludicrous', 'not', 'say', 'infantile', 'sense', 'remind', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'Baader', 'Meinhof', 'was', 'more', 'violent', 'more', 'often', 'just', 'detached', 'political', 'reality', 'organization', 'had', 'mass', 'base', 'posed', 'threat', 'revolution', 'whatsoever', 'deluded', 'were', 'doing', 'something', 'politically', 'important', 'were', 'aided', 'abetted', 'self-important', 'view', 'police', 'especially', 'US', 'who', 'reacted', 'groups', 'were', 'serious', 'threat', 'political', 'stability', 'groups', 'underestimated', 'ability', 'willingness', 'Western', 'governments', 'adopt', 'totalitarian', 'tactics', 'destroy', 'leftists', 'who', 'resorted', 'action', 'street.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'soft', 'handling', 'German', 'police', 'not', 'maybe', 'really', 'were', 'more', 'restrained', 'infamous', 'local', 'US', 'police', 'FBI', 'red', 'squads', 'leader', 'anti-radical', 'unit', 'played', 'Bruno', 'Ganz', 'who', 'played', 'Hitler', 'Downfall', 'portrayed', 'thoughtful', 'generally', 'moderate', 'rank-and-file', 'police', 'are', 'shown', 'handing', 'beatings', 'prisoners', 'are', 'subjected', 'lengthy', 'terms', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'movie', 'not', 'pursue', 'possibility', 'government-paid', 'agitators', 'might', 'have', 'attained', 'leadership', 'positions', 'most', 'certainly', 'did', 'US', '.Fortunately', 'movie', 'action', 'rather', 'ideology', 'Mao', 'cited', 'only', 'once', 'twice', 'film', 'not', 'romanticize', 'revolutionaries', 'expend', 'energy', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'navel-gazing', 'introspective', 'brooding', 'action', 'was', 'what', 'Baader', 'Meinhof', 'was', 'about', 'not', 'reflecting', 'action', 'made', 'sense', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'will', 'help', 'anyone', '50', 'explain', 'Sixties', 'children', 'entertain', 'as', 'well']",The Baader Meinhof Complex [Region 2]

It struck me as important to concentrate on an evil that is palpable in this film: urban terrorism as avante-garde chic. The rather lavish special effects made me ill. Perhaps that is an important message, but I've seen enough in my time. Seeing it in film is not my cup of tea.This is a story, a true story but it seems some aren't really sure. It deals with a bunch of self-centered little idiots in late 1960s West Germany who get fed up with what they view as police brutality ... something that may have been planted there by East Germany anyway. They start talking themselves into a frenzy and soon become a Red Army of sorts.Except for the fact that it is all idiotic, gratuitous violence for them and their schizophrenic ideals, it works out pretty well. Lots of explosions, murders, the most vicious of name-calling.The big problem is these kids are fighting for NOTHING. They stupidly chant Ho Chi Min's name without understanding the wider scale of Viet Nam. They publicly worship the self-Messianic-obsessed Che Guevara. They are big, ugly bullying babies with guns that they get from the neo-NAZIs.Why be apologetic about it? These people think they are the Savior Bunch. Who cares if heads get broken and bombs go off, as long as they are happy? (Or rather, happy in their discontented, ruthless and brainless violence.)I suspected (when I noticed certain things in this film) that these are the same Germans who were involved in the Entebbe incident. Certainly that and Munich came to mind. It is a simple cycle: call some police a few choice names; start a cycle of violence. Get tossed in jail and give the newly forming terrorist cells a cause to fight for; get out of jail and find better ways to terrorize a confused populace. Like getting in bed with the Palestinians. Simple.What is weird is when I watched this film I had seen an odd 2002 movie calledMax(see my review), starring John Cusack as Max the Jewish art dealer (fictional character) and Noah Taylor as a young Hitler trying to sell him his paintings (fictional event). In the end, Hitler is screaming his speech in a beer hall. He goes up to Max, who is Jewish, and tells him ""politics is the new art, the all-encapsulating spectacle."" Hitler really believed that. So too did the kids portrayed in THE BAADER MEINHOF COMPLEX, and it was just too creepy seeing one thing bleed into the other, one allegedly the ultimate cause of the other.In reality this is an expose of brutal ideas overtaking weak minds. Oh, they can reason things out a few degrees, perhaps, but they are weak and without vision. They are without any proper human feeling at all.

1255190,A23IV3DK4EAXJH,B00285WR9M,"fCh ""fCh""","[3, 5]","There are many levels at which this long film can be approached.  I'll talk about three of them:To begin with its aesthetic value, it's all in there!  Most everything that comes out of it must have been carefully thought of.  For example, the color of the whole film blends with that of the documentaries, several of which are quoted in this film, from the late '60s-early '70s--this is a clever device that makes the viewer think of it as a documentary.  Many other careful reproductions of the context of the the time also turn this into a quasi-documentary.  The (artistic) value is then built by adding enough psychological depth to the several characters, beyond some level of caricature associated usually with documentaries.There is then a correspondence with the historic fact/reality.  Here's where this film falls short, for a couple of reasons.  Firstly, I doubt the suicides, all of them.  Stefan Aust, the author of the book on which the whole film is based, acknowledges that all was not clear about the suicides at the time--see him in an interview on the companion dvd.  One could argue that the terrorists/revolutionaries were SILENCED.  Uli Edel, the film director, could have shown some newspaper/TV announcement instead of directing the camera to follow the official/Aust's line.  Secondly, I find it problematic that this film makes no reference whatsoever to what I suspect had been the main backer of the terrorists/revolutionaries, the Soviet Union/KGB/(STASI?).  The only indirect reference to the other bloc as support comes from the sketched trips of the terrorists/revolutionaries to Arab lands.  The makers of the film may argue that such perspective was not within their objective, but then we see some American intelligence support for the German authorities (e.g. computers, database, etc.).  On these two points, this film loses 1.5 stars.  Is it still worth buying/watching? By all means, especially from the perspective of the next point I'll make.Last, this film is veritable mental exercise, if not provocation, for the aware viewer in the beginning of the 21st century.  One gets the idea of what a system is, how it operates, its anti-bodies, and the role of the young, the revolutionaries, the opposing system, the masses, and everything else.  As well, countries should do better/more to understand the context and actors in which these events happened in every separate case--in the late sixties, we were looking at a revolt (or revolts?) of a generation of postwar youth who had a lot in common despite being distributed among several countries (USA, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and even in the Soviet Bloc).  Can we all say it was then that revolutions were put to rest by the newly achieved prosperity?______________________Check out the supplements dvd for a look at the neo-bourgeois becoming as illustrated by Stefan Aust and keep the image of Joschka Fischer, the former German minister of foreign affairs, in mind as well!",3,"it's actually 3.5 stars, but as worth watching as many a 5-star film",1275177600,"05 30, 2010",2010,2975,"['are', 'many', 'levels', 'long', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'approached', ""'ll"", 'talk', 'three', 'begin', 'aesthetic', 'value', 'Most', 'everything', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'carefully', 'thought', 'example', 'color', 'whole', 'film', 'blends', 'documentaries', 'several', 'are', 'quoted', 'film', 'late', ""'60s-early"", ""'70s"", 'clever', 'device', 'viewer', 'think', 'documentary', 'Many', 'other', 'careful', 'reproductions', 'context', 'time', 'also', 'turn', 'quasi-documentary', 'artistic', 'value', 'then', 'built', 'adding', 'enough', 'psychological', 'depth', 'several', 'characters', 'level', 'caricature', 'associated', 'usually', 'documentaries.There', 'then', 'correspondence', 'historic', 'fact/reality', 'Here', 'where', 'film', 'short', 'couple', 'reasons', 'Firstly', 'doubt', 'suicides', 'Stefan', 'Aust', 'author', 'book', 'whole', 'film', 'based', 'was', 'not', 'clear', 'suicides', 'time', 'see', 'interview', 'companion', 'dvd', 'One', 'could', 'argue', 'terrorists/revolutionaries', 'were', 'SILENCED', 'Uli', 'Edel', 'film', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'shown', 'newspaper/TV', 'announcement', 'instead', 'directing', 'camera', 'follow', 'official/Aust', 'line', 'Secondly', 'find', 'problematic', 'film', 'reference', 'whatsoever', 'what', 'suspect', 'had', 'been', 'main', 'backer', 'terrorists/revolutionaries', 'Soviet', 'Union/KGB/', 'STASI', 'only', 'indirect', 'reference', 'other', 'bloc', 'support', 'sketched', 'trips', 'terrorists/revolutionaries', 'Arab', 'lands', 'makers', 'film', 'may', 'argue', 'such', 'perspective', 'was', 'not', 'objective', 'then', 'see', 'American', 'intelligence', 'support', 'German', 'authorities', 'e.g', 'computers', 'database', 'etc.', 'two', 'points', 'film', '1.5', 'stars', 'still', 'buying/watching', 'means', 'especially', 'perspective', 'next', 'point', ""'ll"", 'make.Last', 'film', 'veritable', 'mental', 'exercise', 'not', 'provocation', 'aware', 'viewer', 'beginning', '21st', 'century', 'One', 'idea', 'what', 'system', 'how', 'anti-bodies', 'role', 'young', 'revolutionaries', 'opposing', 'system', 'masses', 'everything', 'else', 'As', 'well', 'countries', 'should', 'do', 'better/more', 'understand', 'context', 'actors', 'events', 'happened', 'separate', 'case', 'late', 'sixties', 'were', 'looking', 'revolt', 'revolts', 'generation', 'postwar', 'youth', 'who', 'had', 'lot', 'common', 'being', 'distributed', 'several', 'countries', 'USA', 'France', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Japan', 'even', 'Soviet', 'Bloc', 'Can', 'say', 'was', 'then', 'revolutions', 'were', 'put', 'rest', 'newly', 'achieved', 'prosperity', '______________________Check', 'supplements', 'dvd', 'look', 'neo-bourgeois', 'becoming', 'illustrated', 'Stefan', 'Aust', 'keep', 'image', 'Joschka', 'Fischer', 'former', 'German', 'minister', 'foreign', 'affairs', 'mind', 'well']",The Baader Meinhof Complex [Region 2]

While true to the story, the film is quite different from the book. Despite running 143 minutes, the film is very fast paced & strong on action while being somewhat light on detail. I found the book too clinical & slow paced, & found the film to be almost the opposite. I enjoyed the film once I got over being angry about the teeny subtitles, but would not recommend it to someone who didn't already have a reasonably good familiarity with the RAF story; unless all you're looking for is an entertaining action thriller. Having some idea of the RAF story from Aust's book, I found the film enjoyable, but still had some issues understanding small sections. From an entertainment & emotional point of view, it is largely an enjoyable film, & my understanding is that Mr. Aust was involved in insuring it was as factually correct as possible.I also found the film to paint the most sympathetic picture of the RAF I have seen anywhere other then extreme left web sites. While I lean strongly left myself & agree with some of their ideals, I'm not sure that these folks deserve a sympathetic portrait. They were cold blooded killers.

1255193,A3NH7PYU4AD5GA,B00285WR9M,H. Schneider,"[7, 11]","This movie was nominated for best foreign movie Oscar, but failed to win. Maybe just as well. It is not all that great, though by my own classification 4 stars equals 'not bad', which is a high compliment.If you never heard of Baader and Meinhof: these were the names by which the West German terrorist group Rote Armee Fraktion, ie Red Army Faction, was initially known in Germany. Their time was the 70s. They were a most prolific group in terms of crimes committed. For sure no other gang killed so many people since WW2 in Germany. They killed American service men, Dutch policemen, German bankers, managers, politicians, prosecutors, diplomats, police men, body guards ... They robbed banks. They held people hostage in Stockholm (German Embassy) and Vienna (OPEC congress). They kidnapped people. They cooperated with international terrorists and highjacked planes. I am sure I forgot one or the other atrocious act, but you get the picture.The two names stand for the two extremes in the leadership of the gang:Ulrike Meinhof was a well known left wing journalist, who moved into terrorism from the so-called extra-parliamentarian opposition (APO) during the 60s in Germany. You need to see as background the following main events to understand this:1.the protests against the Vietnam war;2.the protests against the 'grand coalition' in Germany, which at that time decided on emergency laws reminiscent of Hitler's empowerment laws, which had allowed him to assume total power after winning an election and a coalition government appointment;3.the protests against a visit by the Shah of Iran, during which police shot and killed a protester;4.the protests against the most powerful media concern in Germany at the time; the Springer concern had fought publicly against the APO and one of the APO leaders (Rudi Dutschke) got shot and incapacitated, allegedly due to the press campaign against him (which I consider quite likely to be true).The other leader, Andreas Baader, was a nobody compared to Ulrike. He was just a macho, a gangster, an attractive bravado, who bullied his way to the informal top. Meinhof probably did not have remotely the same power as he had in the gang.The group was amazingly successful. After the first batch of leaders was caught and imprisoned, the group continued the fight with second and third generation leaders. Meinhof, Baader, and other top people of the group committed suicide in prison. Others fought on. It lasted several more years.The movie is a semi-documentary, based on a book by Stefan Aust, the former chief editor of Der Spiegel, who was personally involved on the fringe. He had been a journalist at the magazine where Meinhof also worked before she went underground. He was friends with her ex-husband and helped save the couple's daughters from disappearing in a Palestinian orphanage. The story of the group up to the death of the first generation of leaders is told with substantial inside knowledge.For understanding modern European history, the film is valuable and I recommend it.",4,Times of Lead,1236384000,"03 7, 2009",2009,3045,"['movie', 'was', 'nominated', 'best', 'foreign', 'movie', 'Oscar', 'failed', 'win', 'Maybe', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'great', 'though', 'own', 'classification', '4', 'stars', 'equals', 'bad', 'high', 'compliment.If', 'never', 'heard', 'Baader', 'Meinhof', 'were', 'names', 'West', 'German', 'terrorist', 'group', 'Rote', 'Armee', 'Fraktion', 'ie', 'Red', 'Army', 'Faction', 'was', 'initially', 'known', 'Germany', 'time', 'was', '70s', 'were', 'most', 'prolific', 'group', 'terms', 'crimes', 'committed', 'sure', 'other', 'gang', 'killed', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'WW2', 'Germany', 'killed', 'American', 'service', 'men', 'Dutch', 'policemen', 'German', 'bankers', 'managers', 'politicians', 'prosecutors', 'diplomats', 'police', 'men', 'body', 'guards', 'robbed', 'banks', 'held', 'people', 'hostage', 'Stockholm', 'German', 'Embassy', 'Vienna', 'OPEC', 'congress', 'kidnapped', 'people', 'cooperated', 'international', 'terrorists', 'highjacked', 'planes', 'am', 'sure', 'forgot', 'one', 'other', 'atrocious', 'act', 'get', 'picture.The', 'two', 'names', 'stand', 'two', 'extremes', 'leadership', 'gang', 'Meinhof', 'was', 'well', 'known', 'left', 'wing', 'journalist', 'who', 'moved', 'terrorism', 'so-called', 'extra-parliamentarian', 'opposition', 'APO', '60s', 'Germany', 'need', 'see', 'following', 'main', 'events', 'understand', 'this:1.the', 'protests', 'Vietnam', 'war', '2.the', 'protests', ""'grand"", 'coalition', 'Germany', 'time', 'decided', 'emergency', 'laws', 'reminiscent', 'Hitler', 'empowerment', 'laws', 'had', 'allowed', 'assume', 'total', 'power', 'winning', 'election', 'coalition', 'government', 'appointment', '3.the', 'protests', 'visit', 'Shah', 'Iran', 'police', 'shot', 'killed', 'protester', '4.the', 'protests', 'most', 'powerful', 'media', 'concern', 'Germany', 'time', 'Springer', 'concern', 'had', 'fought', 'publicly', 'APO', 'one', 'APO', 'leaders', 'Rudi', 'Dutschke', 'got', 'shot', 'incapacitated', 'allegedly', 'due', 'press', 'campaign', 'consider', 'quite', 'likely', 'be', 'true', '.The', 'other', 'leader', 'Andreas', 'Baader', 'was', 'nobody', 'compared', 'Ulrike', 'was', 'just', 'macho', 'gangster', 'attractive', 'bravado', 'who', 'bullied', 'way', 'informal', 'top', 'Meinhof', 'probably', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'remotely', 'same', 'power', 'had', 'gang.The', 'group', 'was', 'amazingly', 'successful', 'first', 'batch', 'leaders', 'was', 'caught', 'imprisoned', 'group', 'continued', 'fight', 'second', 'third', 'generation', 'leaders', 'Meinhof', 'Baader', 'other', 'top', 'people', 'group', 'committed', 'suicide', 'prison', 'Others', 'fought', 'lasted', 'several', 'more', 'years.The', 'movie', 'semi-documentary', 'based', 'book', 'Stefan', 'Aust', 'former', 'chief', 'editor', 'Der', 'Spiegel', 'who', 'was', 'personally', 'involved', 'fringe', 'had', 'been', 'journalist', 'magazine', 'where', 'Meinhof', 'also', 'worked', 'went', 'underground', 'was', 'friends', 'ex-husband', 'helped', 'save', 'couple', 'daughters', 'disappearing', 'Palestinian', 'orphanage', 'story', 'group', 'up', 'death', 'first', 'generation', 'leaders', 'told', 'substantial', 'inside', 'knowledge.For', 'understanding', 'modern', 'European', 'history', 'film', 'valuable', 'recommend']",The Baader Meinhof Complex [Region 2]

DeMeo ""naturalenergyworks""","[16, 62]","""The Heroic Revolutionaries"" is how this should have been titled, as the film is a non-stop view of the BM killers from their own radical viewpoint, even though the producers and directors say otherwise.  So the viewer is greeted from the start with images from the Vietnam War -- but only things that make the USA look bad.  Of course, no scenes of North Vietnamese peasants being disembowled by ""comrades"" for trying to flee the collective, or the Massacre at Hue they carried out (Americans were prosecuted for war-crimes, while Vietnamese generals got medals).  No mention of the Communist gulag and prison-state status of the East Bloc, Soviet Union, Red China, etc., whom these misguided radicals all loved so much.  Israel is back-handedly slapped and the Palestinians are extolled as virtuous revolutionarys also in the film, which shows none of the barbarism of the Marxist or Islamic cadres.  One is left to wonder why Nazi-hating left-wing radicals are so hot to kill Americans and Jews, that they they team up with the worst of the Nazi-inspired Islamo-fanatics.  We can likewise contrast the scenes and words about the Shah of Iran, where nothing is mentioned about Khomeini and the Mullocracy Iran has since degenerated into -- and whom the left-wing still has a love-affair with today... or perhaps a severe memory-lapse about how leftists the world over flocked to Iran to kiss Khomeini's feet, just as they did with Ho, and still do with Castro and all the rest of the totalitarians.  The young Iranian students today would celebrate if the Shah came back to power, but both Iran and Vietnam are today giant Prison-States, with a history of large massacres of ordinary people having occurred following the removal of American power and influence in those regions... just think of what the Khmer ""Reds"" did in Cambodia...  but you will get my point.  Nothing of this is outlined to warn the film viewer, that history already has discredited the BM-gang's avowed reasons.The foundational assumptions about what set off the young self-righteous, misinformed liberals of that period, who later formed the BM gang, and then embraced the World Socialist Revolution were not accurate then, nor today... and in this respect the film-makers clearly position themselves as ""revisionist historians"" out to justify BM crimes.  They expose a shared enthusiasm for the bloody actions of the BM killers, and through lies-of-omission their enthusiasm for the Communist slave-states around the world.  One sees this exposure of motivations more openly in a special feature documentary on the DVD.  I think a lot of young people who today are brainwashed by the radical-left accusations against America and Israel -- readers of Red Fascist propaganda by writers like Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn, Michael Moore, etc. -- will eat this up and burn with fury, wishing they too could get guns and behave like an intellectual pistolero, drunk on Marxism instead of whiskey, robbing banks and frightening the peasants.  Not that post-war German society was perfect, and yes a lot of old Nazis still lurked around in power.  But the BM Reds could have joined with Weisenthal, or other Nazi-hunting, authentic social reform groups.  Or they could have simply crossed the border and lived in the socialist paradise, at any point. In fact, most of these ""comrades"" came from well-off homes and were more comfortable in the universities than in labor-union halls, with the toiling masses of workers.  They never did a lick of sweat-raising work in their lives.  And that's true of most of the phoney left revolutionaries, to include such head-shooting ""heroes"" extolled in the film like Che Guevara, who is awfully compared in scenes to Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy, as if they were ""all the same"".  No, they weren't.  The BM gang could have accomplished something positive had they taken lessons from those two Americans, who did change America for the better. But to do that, they would have to change their reading list, and stop wasting time with Marx, Che, and all the other fanatics.It is nevertheless a gripping film, well acted and produced, though the English sub-titles are difficult to read.

Superb directing, acting, cinematography and editing. 2-1/2 hours goes by very quickly when you are in the hands of top-knotch artist like Uli Edel. I didn't read the book that this movie was based on so some of my criticism here probably needs to be directed at the author of that book. BUT, I have no intention of reading the book and so this movie is my introduction to the book AND to the thinking (or its lack) of the screen writer, director and other contributors to this movie.Here's the question that I feel is absolutely essential in these 60s nostalgia movies: did the members of the RAF know about mass-murdering and REALLY bad treatment of dissidents in the Soviet Union and their many proxies of that era? and if so, what was their moral position on these police states? Wouldn't we all like to see this critical area explored in the background to this pivotal time in world history? It would clear up many otherwise unexplained aspects to their behavior.Never forget that radical criticism is a MORAL finger wagging. Yet, most apologists and fans of the 60s radicals never seriously engage on the moral aspects of their beliefs. They simply pretend to speak from a higher moral position and sermonize. They are the modern equivalent of the church ladies of yore. They just assume that the moral underpinnings of their beliefs arise from solid philosophical grounds and that these are beyond debate -- even in self-reflection. This is a very shallow system of thought and this is ESSENTIAL to understanding this era and why these people were so flawed and why they gave vent to such bestial rages. Why don't modern artists deal with this? EVER? Because they don't like where this line of reasoning goes, if they can follow the arguments at all.

It tells the story of a time and a place in history that most Americans were not even aware of.  It started in the late 1960s when young people were rebelling and peace and love was in the air in America. It was different in Germany though.  Their young people called themselves ""The Red Army Faction"" and engaged in bombings, robberies, kidnappings and assassinations in order to create what they thought of as a better world.  One of the events I did remember was the murder of the Israeli Olympic athletes in the mid 1970s. Eventually many of them went to jail where they went on hunger strikes, created havoc and committed suicide.This movie is their story which was quite fascinating to me because I had never heard of them before.  But at 2 hours and 30 minutes I found my interest waning, especially since it was all subtitles and if I closed my eyes for a minute I missed a lot.  And so I cannot remember any of the details.However I'll never forget the wildness and the anger and complete dedication to the cause that this group exhibited.

This film was lacking the character development,to give the viewer reason to care.Many of the events were glossed over,to cram the film into two and a half hours.Their political objectives were also ,in the background,of this quasi-documentary.This film hits the nail on the head with the fact, that this group of aging 'halbstarkers',were a group of hoppel-de-poppel anarchists.The german version of the Manson family.Where eveything was peace and love,in the beginning.The ringleaders were rounded-up,the bellicose bellwethers locked up.And later,violence to potential defectors hung over the heads ,of the group's leftovers.The remaining radicals were already so alienated from normal society,they had nothing to lose.The irony with the RAF and the Manson family also,is that they were considered political inspired.But really,they both had a very weak understanding society,family and governmental operations.I think if Marx and Engels had met them ,they would have seen them as intellectually inferior people.And Mao and Stalin would have seen them as physically lazy and unattentive to strict principles of true revolutionary warfare.Atheists,communists and anarchists have little regard for the environment and their fellow humans.The moslims have 'Allah' and the christians have 'Jesus'.The RAF had no idols to worship,perhaps later only the Baader-Meinhof martyres. So these kids read a few leftist books,they dabbled in mischief.The film gives an entertaining tabloid version of the Baader-Meinhof gruppa.But,I think a half hour could have been added showing the transition from a hippi-beatnik tribe into an agitated anti-social maelstrom of chaos.The closing of the film,shows the disgust of the imprisoned urban guerrillas,and their alledged suicides,after learning the outcome of the failed sky-jacking episode.I have seen the real death photos of the Baader-Meinhof crew.It appeared they were murdered,rather than being suicides.Their eyes looked black-circled,from beatings.It may have been self-inflicted,from sleep deprevation.I think the guards were finished with their circus nonsense and trouble-making,day in and day out.The truth may never be fully known.The RAF activities was a sad chapter,in modern German history.The RAF caused more trouble and problems,than had solved for Germany.And such issues as,global warming and chemical pollution,completely ignored by the RAF.The Baader-Meinhof group made their chief mistake by focusing on the bankers and high-lawers.The bankers and state-lawers are instruments of the state-government,controlled by the jews.I don't think the Baader-Meinhof gang had the organisational preserverence to fully change the state government and install a functioning new working leadership.When you see this film,there are some interesting points,yet not very in-depth.I hope to see a film one day,on the subject of 'Baader-Meinhof',that tells the full story.",4,"Baader-Meinhof

Its too one-sided politically in its coverage of the mid-1960s events. And it makes too many excuses for their radicalization. Baader was an idiot and its hard to see him being motivated by Vietnam or anything else. Meinhof joined the communist party in 1959. While some of the other members became radicalized through events, the core was either criminal or radical from the start.But once it gets past setting the stage, the film is very good in presenting an honest accouting of the activities of the Baader-Meinhof gang. In particular, they do a good job in showing Baader for what he was. Rather than revolutionaries, they come across as a bunch of spoiled upper-class children playing around. Ulrike Meinhof is portrayed far too sympathetically.

But it quickly became a arm of the stasi (the east gernamn secret police) unofficially. This movie shows that these communist terrorists were willing to sacrifice everything including their families and even their own lives for their hoped for revolution. This is a bloody movie and it all happened and in reality it was far worse than this. Like all communist groups though we do see how everyone beoomes the enemy and even 'workers' must be sacrificed. This movie looks great on blu ray and has lots of extras too. THe acting is first class and while you want these murderers to die themselves as they pick out 'enemies' to kill they did cause a massive disruption to germany and help to inspire other groups around the world to commint crimes and even align with them. THis evil continued until 1998 when they finally stopped the slaughter and realized that communism is even worse for workers than capitalist societies ,well at least until right wing fanatics have used the tea party to destroy unions in the u.s.

1255206,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B00285WR9M,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[17, 17]","The Baader Meinhof Complex is an at once exhilarating and horrific depiction of the rise and fall of a very prominent left-wing extremist group in '70s Germany, formed from an uneasy alliance between journalist Ulrike Meinhof and the incendiary couple Andreas Baader and his girlfriend Gudrun Ensslin.  The film explores the initial motivations for their radicalization, the shift from anger and rebellion to increasingly violent acts of terror, and the dissolution of the group's ideology into seeming incoherence as the personal began to overwhelm the political.  While watching I wondered if the casting choices had made the characters more appealing than in real life - they were all very striking young men and women - but a bit of research shows it to be quite accurate.  They did a remarkable job in capturing the likeness of the actual individuals depicted.It is a complex film, that highlights the allure of the struggle, at the same time as it reveals the individuals behind it to be deeply human and imperfect, at times conflicted and at others resolute, even dogmatic, to the point of becoming what they had initially struggled against - these are not the mythological figures that came to be idolized by some and hated by others.  A fascinating paradox explored by the film is that in war one side inevitably takes on qualities of its enemy: to fight an underground extremist group, the state must employ its tactics, must become flexible and bend the rule of law and its protection of individual rights such as privacy; to stand up against the force of a powerful regime, the anarchic underground must increasingly become autocratic, must not tolerate dissent.The film is beautifully shot, and edited for an ideal balance of intensity and clarity.  There is the feel of a living situation - characters don't have constantly to explain themselves to each other, and you feel the urgency with which they experience their own moments in time - and yet, there is enough laid out that even those unfamiliar with the actual history this is based on should be able to catch up quickly and follow along.  The decision to incorporate real footage from the era creates a sense of authenticity and even current relevance that is hard to shake off, emphasizing that this film cannot simply be approached as an escapist fantasy.  The reception of the film in Germany at the time of its release was telling - on the one hand there were those who felt that in taking both sides the film failed to capture the heroism and ideals of the leaders, who are still revered by many; and there were others who felt that the decision to tell most of the story from the point of view of the Baader Meinhof group members had the dangerous potential of creating an identification with them and of making their actions seem too glamorous.In fact the film manages both to clarify and make vividly real the sense of a holy war or struggle that young people felt at the time, and to show that these extremists were not simply the vicious killers they had been demonized to be; but also to demonstrate that their ideals and imperfections led to horrific actions, that in many cases destroyed lives without having any clear outcome that could possibly motivate or justify such violence.  I was very young at the time of these events and only remember vague hints of them, but even now going into the film I knew very little of the details.  Definitely worth watching -- both as a valuable history lesson, and as a spur to the kinds of discussions that we need to be having about the meaning and motivations of what we call ""terrorism.""  As the German head of police, played in this film by the always excellent Bruno Ganz, suggests: it is easy enough to demonize the ""enemy"" but there can be no true or lasting victory over extremism and violence without understanding its perpetrators and their perceptions.",4,"A potent depiction of extremism, its motives and consequences; a timely reflection on a pivotal episode in German history",1266019200,"02 13, 2010",2010,3888,"['Baader', 'Meinhof', 'Complex', 'once', 'exhilarating', 'horrific', 'depiction', 'rise', 'fall', 'very', 'prominent', 'left-wing', 'extremist', 'group', ""'70s"", 'Germany', 'formed', 'uneasy', 'alliance', 'journalist', 'Ulrike', 'Meinhof', 'incendiary', 'couple', 'Andreas', 'Baader', 'girlfriend', 'Gudrun', 'Ensslin', 'film', 'initial', 'motivations', 'radicalization', 'shift', 'anger', 'rebellion', 'increasingly', 'violent', 'acts', 'terror', 'dissolution', 'group', 'ideology', 'seeming', 'incoherence', 'personal', 'began', 'overwhelm', 'political', 'watching', 'wondered', 'casting', 'choices', 'had', 'made', 'characters', 'more', 'appealing', 'real', 'life', 'were', 'very', 'striking', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'bit', 'research', 'be', 'quite', 'accurate', 'did', 'remarkable', 'job', 'capturing', 'likeness', 'actual', 'individuals', 'depicted.It', 'complex', 'film', 'allure', 'struggle', 'same', 'time', 'individuals', 'be', 'deeply', 'human', 'imperfect', 'times', 'conflicted', 'others', 'resolute', 'even', 'dogmatic', 'point', 'becoming', 'what', 'had', 'initially', 'struggled', 'are', 'not', 'mythological', 'figures', 'came', 'be', 'idolized', 'hated', 'others', 'fascinating', 'paradox', 'explored', 'film', 'war', 'one', 'side', 'inevitably', 'qualities', 'enemy', 'fight', 'underground', 'extremist', 'group', 'state', 'must', 'employ', 'tactics', 'must', 'become', 'flexible', 'bend', 'rule', 'law', 'protection', 'individual', 'rights', 'such', 'privacy', 'stand', 'up', 'force', 'powerful', 'regime', 'anarchic', 'underground', 'must', 'increasingly', 'become', 'autocratic', 'must', 'not', 'tolerate', 'dissent.The', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'edited', 'ideal', 'balance', 'intensity', 'clarity', 'feel', 'living', 'situation', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'constantly', 'explain', 'other', 'feel', 'urgency', 'experience', 'own', 'moments', 'time', 'yet', 'enough', 'laid', 'even', 'unfamiliar', 'actual', 'history', 'based', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'catch', 'up', 'quickly', 'follow', 'along', 'decision', 'incorporate', 'real', 'footage', 'era', 'sense', 'authenticity', 'even', 'current', 'relevance', 'hard', 'shake', 'off', 'emphasizing', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'simply', 'be', 'approached', 'escapist', 'fantasy', 'reception', 'film', 'Germany', 'time', 'release', 'was', 'telling', 'one', 'hand', 'were', 'who', 'felt', 'taking', 'sides', 'film', 'failed', 'capture', 'heroism', 'ideals', 'leaders', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'revered', 'many', 'were', 'others', 'who', 'felt', 'decision', 'tell', 'most', 'story', 'point', 'view', 'Baader', 'Meinhof', 'group', 'members', 'had', 'dangerous', 'potential', 'creating', 'identification', 'making', 'actions', 'seem', 'too', 'glamorous.In', 'fact', 'film', 'clarify', 'make', 'vividly', 'real', 'sense', 'holy', 'war', 'struggle', 'young', 'people', 'felt', 'time', 'show', 'extremists', 'were', 'not', 'simply', 'vicious', 'killers', 'had', 'been', 'demonized', 'be', 'also', 'demonstrate', 'ideals', 'imperfections', 'led', 'horrific', 'actions', 'many', 'cases', 'destroyed', 'having', 'clear', 'outcome', 'could', 'possibly', 'motivate', 'justify', 'such', 'violence', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'time', 'events', 'only', 'remember', 'vague', 'hints', 'even', 'now', 'going', 'film', 'knew', 'very', 'little', 'details', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'valuable', 'history', 'lesson', 'spur', 'kinds', 'discussions', 'need', 'be', 'having', 'meaning', 'motivations', 'what', 'call', 'terrorism', 'German', 'head', 'police', 'played', 'film', 'always', 'excellent', 'Bruno', 'Ganz', 'easy', 'enough', 'demonize', 'enemy', 'can', 'be', 'true', 'lasting', 'victory', 'extremism', 'violence', 'understanding', 'perpetrators', 'perceptions']",The Baader Meinhof Complex [Region 2]

Director Uli Edell provides important details about the reasons for the militancy and the different ways that the Baader-Meinhof militants wrought violent disruption of West German society while tapping into the older generation's unresolved issues from its Nazi past. Edell at once portrays the militants as committed, oftentimes ruthless fighters, demonstrating that these individuals were not victims, but rather, people who were willing to stop at nothing to achieve their goals of breaking what they viewed as the complacency and terror of the West German state that had evolved far too little from its Nazi past. It is vital however, to investigate further than Edell's remarkable film, to gauge the extent and scope of the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon by looking through a couple of scholarly works on this important passage in recent German history.Baader-Meinhof Returns: History and Cultural Memory of German Left-Wing Terrorism (German Monitor)andBringing the War Home: The Weather Underground, the Red Army Faction, and Revolutionary Violence in the Sixties and Seventieswill shed light on these events in a more detailed and careful fashion.

Christiane F. remains the starkest, grimest, most haunting, realistic and best film I have yet seen about drug addiction. Edel since then has certainly become a surprisingly superb director. In fact The Baader Meinhof Complex is one of the finest German films I have ever seen. Here Edel directs with genuine craft, the sort that rivals some of the best american political thrillers to date. The one film that kept coming to mind while I watched this film was Steven Spielberg's superb story of the massacre of Jewish athletes in the film- Munich, and how the government of Israel retaliates for their deaths. Edel masterfully gives this film the same realism and directorial excellence as Spielberg did with Munich. Meinhof complex is a riveting, dramatic story about the radical German Red Faction Army and the political events that led to the formation of this defiant group of young terrorists.

A faction or network of government uses its access to the levers of power to promote actions in various ways.

Thus terrorism in the modern era is the means by which oligarchies wage secretwars against peoplewhich it would be politically impossible to wage openly.In Germany, Detlev Karsten Rohwedder was the cheif of thr Trusteeship Agency which in 1991 was the largest corporation in the world. In the communist German Democratic Republic(GDR) collapsed in 1989, all industry that was property of the state & was transferred to the Trusteeship Agency. Rohweeder, as the haed of this entity, preferred to keep the vast state property of the GDR as a state sector to maintain existing levels of employment and production so as to facilitate the absorbtion of the East German regions into a unified Germany. Anglo-American financiers wanted all the GDR state property to be put on the auction block at once, so that it could be sold off at bargain basement prices to Wall Street & the City of London. When Rohwedder proved reluctant to accept this policy he was assinated by elements claiming to be the Baader-Meinhof group. Rohwedder's successor immediately began selling off GDR state property the way the City of London/Anglo Americans wanted.

The global idealism of the 1960s had, by the mid-70s, spiraled downhill into the nihilistic violence of Baader-Meinhoff, the Red Brigades, Provo-IRA, Tupamaros, the Weathermen: the devolution of young intelligentsia in revolt who - initially struggling to make the world a better place - become emissaries of violence themselves: brutality begetting brutality.  Bonnie and Clyde have become Charles Manson, removing themselves from a lost cause in one last attentat of defiance.The film's strength is in portraying this transformation from within their own minds, without romanticizing them.  This is made easy by 30 years' passing.  But it also avoids the pitfall of demonizing them, not an easy task in this age of ""wars on terror.""  Edel accomplished this by recalling his own angst of the period.  The hindsight he weaves into the narrative is subtle enough not to intrude on its contemporary passion.Ulrike Meinhof herself comes across as a rather lame figure in this film.  The depth of her mind - and the tragedy of its decomposition - is not adequately fleshed out.  It's Johanna Wokalek as Gundrun Esslin who steals the show.  The others - even Andreas Baader - seem only her puppets, as the charismatic eros of her sexual/political revolution hardened into death-dealing fanaticism.The degeneration of the period's faith and dreams set the stage for the cynical 70s, and the rightist resurgence of the 80s.  In large part Western politicians are still fighting the battles of 1968; and though the Establishment has won - King is a marbled martyr, Che a T-shirt - it yet looks nervously over its shoulder",4,Evokes Its Time,1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,1670,"['Uli', 'Edel', 'here', 'bequeathed', 'signature', 'masterpiece', 'global', 'idealism', '1960s', 'had', 'mid-70s', 'spiraled', 'downhill', 'nihilistic', 'violence', 'Baader-Meinhoff', 'Red', 'Brigades', 'Provo-IRA', 'Tupamaros', 'Weathermen', 'devolution', 'young', 'intelligentsia', 'revolt', 'who', 'initially', 'struggling', 'make', 'world', 'better', 'place', 'become', 'emissaries', 'violence', 'brutality', 'begetting', 'brutality', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'have', 'become', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'removing', 'lost', 'cause', 'one', 'last', 'attentat', 'defiance.The', 'film', 'strength', 'portraying', 'transformation', 'own', 'minds', 'romanticizing', 'made', 'easy', '30', 'years', 'passing', 'also', 'pitfall', 'demonizing', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'age', 'wars', 'terror', 'Edel', 'accomplished', 'recalling', 'own', 'angst', 'period', 'hindsight', 'narrative', 'subtle', 'enough', 'not', 'intrude', 'contemporary', 'passion.Ulrike', 'Meinhof', 'across', 'rather', 'lame', 'figure', 'film', 'depth', 'mind', 'tragedy', 'decomposition', 'not', 'adequately', 'fleshed', 'out', 'Johanna', 'Wokalek', 'Gundrun', 'Esslin', 'who', 'show', 'others', 'even', 'Andreas', 'Baader', 'seem', 'only', 'puppets', 'charismatic', 'eros', 'sexual/political', 'revolution', 'hardened', 'death-dealing', 'fanaticism.The', 'degeneration', 'period', 'faith', 'dreams', 'set', 'stage', 'cynical', '70s', 'rightist', 'resurgence', '80s', 'large', 'part', 'Western', 'politicians', 'are', 'still', 'fighting', 'battles', '1968', 'Establishment', 'won', 'King', 'marbled', 'martyr', 'Che', 'T-shirt', 'yet', 'nervously', 'shoulder']",The Baader Meinhof Complex [Region 2]

1255217,A1DHFQP9G5F7LY,B00285WR9M,Stephen C. Bird,"[1, 1]","I had first heard of the Baader-Meinhof Gruppe  / Rote Armee Fraktion (RAF) from my high school German instructor when I was a teenager in the 1970's--When the events this film is based upon were actually happening.  But I never gave the subject any thought after that time.  I thought the RAF (Rote Armee Fraktion) was similar to the Symbionese Liberation Army in the USA.  After seeing this picture--I know differently.  This is a fast-paced, adrenalin-inducing type of film about a terrorist group that grew out of the international era of unrest in the late 1960s--Inspired by the desire of the German youth to distance themselves from their elders who stood idly by as the Fascist Nazis took over their country.  The ""Stadtguerilla"" RAF started out euphorically in the late 1960's but by the mid-1970s the anarchistic management of the organization has descended into chaos. This picture ends up providing a historical overview of the RAF, and is entertaining in the process.  ""The Baader-Meinhof Complex""also inspired me to read up on the RAF in both the English and German language versions of Wikipedia.  The performances are generally excellent, especially the female characters--Johanna Wokalek (as Gudrun Ensslin) is on fire !!!  I could see Ms. Wokalek playing ""Medea"" on the stage.  Other standouts include Nadja Uhl (as the coolly intense Brigitte Mohnhaupt); and Hannah Herzsprung (as Susanne Albrecht) in a small but memorable role.  Moritz Bleibtreu is also very good as the unpredictable and volatile bad-boy group leader Andreas Baader.  Having seen Martin Gedeck (Ulrike Meinhof) in other German films (Mostly Martha, The Lives of Others)--I was not as impressed with her performance.  She always seems to play herself rather than delving into a character.  But then--She is generally a leading lady.In closing--There is an incredible amount of bonus material included in this 2 DVD set of ""The Baader-Meinhof Complex"".  Too much in fact (be careful if you suffer from OCD because you'll have to watch all of it).  Not only is there a documentary about the making of the film on DVD 1--There are 3 interviews each with the director, the screenwriter, and the writer of the book upon which this film was based--all on DVD 2.  Not to mention interviews with the lead actors as well as those in supporting roles (also on DVD 2).  They all wax philosophically over their various modes of participation in this project--Ad nauseum.  It goes on endlessly and tends to be redundant.  Certain clips are repeated among the various bonus segments.  It makes me think that the creators of this picture are somehow megalomaniacal.  However--If you are a student of the German language (as I am)--Here's a great opportunity to listen to and to learn more German--No matter what one thinks of the content of the bonus material.Stephen C.

It's one of the most expensive films ever made in Germany with explosions galore. It all begins with Ulrike Meinhof, a left wing West German liberal journalis, who criticizes the Shah and his Queen of Iran when visiting Berlin. She's married and a mother of two daughters.Slowly, we watch Ulrike descend into the RAF (Red Army Faction) with other characters such as Andreas Baader, Gundrun, Astrid, and others. Their German parents were likely involved in World War II as Nazis and Fascists. The Baader Meinhof Complex is the story about the 10 years from 1967 to 1977 when the new generation of Germans revolted against a new kind of fascism in their country. They not only protested but escalated into domestic terrorism.This film brilliantly displays the cruelty, violence, senseless, and lack of messages established in their crimes. For the first 90 minutes, the Baader Meinhof group is free or escapes from punishment at times. The actress (Martina Gedeck) who played Ulrike Meinhof did a fantastic job in showing her evolvement from a left wing West German journalist into an activist and one of the most wanted.Even the last hour where they are imprisoned is done accurately. In watching the making of the film, we see how the director and his crew gone to great lengths in re-creating their prison situation for the audience. This film was brilliantly done and well-worth the accolades.Normally, I put some films aside to donate but not this film. I just can't give this film up.

Ensslin's father defends her self-realization and freedom from fear after the hearing.Meinhoff writes protest is the difference between crime and political action;interviews Ensslin in prison,who says they will not idly re-witness the spread of Fascism,""If they shoot,we will shoot back"".They will show their solidarity with people the world over.Baader is shown as a headstrong hoodlum,hot tempered and psychopathic, broaching no challenges to his leadership,sexist,stealing and racing cars.Freed, pending appeal,Baader and Ensslin escape to Italy,later to join Meinhoff back in Germany, where they hide out.'RAF' is created to change the political situation.Ensslin calls for a new morality,'freed from the system,and burn all bridges behind you'.Horst Herald(Ganz),Chief Commisioner, sees groups oppressed by society willing to throw bombs vs. society's rigidity.1in 4 people are for the BMG in their earlier stage of bank- robbings- and- bombings-activism.We see them training in a PLA terrorist camp with some comedy in a nude scene.Meinhoff coins terms like 'pig' for people in uniform.The balance of rational resistance and protest is tipped once Meinhoff joins the RAF.She loses her objctive, analytical grasp and puts out shallow Maoist sermonizing.Combining with Baader's psychotic criminality and Ensslin's ruthless zeal,Meinhoff's counsel of carefulness gets swept aside.Their unrealistic demands-the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam -lead to the bombing of military and police headquarters,the shooting of policeman,and bombings against judges and prosecutors.There is also the planting of the Axel-Springer bomb in the printing works with a 5 minute warning with many injured.The unleashing of violence against ordinary civilians is shown as the straw that breaks the camels back.Divisions open up in the group between Meinhoff and Baader-Ensslin,especially when they are all in Stammheim prison,when she realizes she cannot defend herself without betraying the group and commits suicide.Ensslin changes her words all the time.The prison scenes appear less effective, as we witness hunger strikes,disruption of the trial,their getting together,fights,secret communications with 2nd generation RAF, whose blood-letting and brutality increases.The entire country's police force, in a state of high alert, is shown with the support of Germans to increase surveillance and checkpoint controls as they `slap the water' to frighten `the fishes into the nets'. Deaths in custody make the terrorists more desperate to free the original RAF and we get the `German Autumn',44 days of mayhem,the kidnap of Schleyer,the holding of the Luftansa hostages,where the RAF join with Palestinian terrorists to free the 11 prisoners.This part of the film becomes a trial of endurance and attention.The problem with the film is that so much happens,10 years in 2.5 hours,that the action thriller crams in so many events that one's ability to absorb and reflect gets squeezed out.The acting and lesson in this period in German history is excellent and the reconstructions and use of real locations.The director-writer's sympathy rests on Meinhoff as we witness her reaction to events and her changes.Once she dies, the doorway of interest closes too. The group's corruption came with their lack of relation to complex modern systems and their simple-minded thuggery which turned their high minded idealism into crime.Compromise is the essence of humanity.The abandonment of one's children and one's reasonableness should not be a price.Reducing people to objects,'pigs','swine'to dehumanise them so they can be killed without conscience led to the increase in violent murders.The emphasis in the last thirdof the film on action leads to a loss of subtlety and nuance.",4,"Complex-a political psychosis,not political complexity!",1268352000,"03

Rapid 'industrial growth'justified the mass enslavement of children in the educational system and the bankers and numerous industrialists had in many cases become serious supporters of corporate fascism , which supported among other things the idea of keeping children in state run or public schools all over every city all across Germany. Paradises had been turned into sterile construction nightmares , and there was really no other solution then and that is why the Baader Meinhof Komplex was formed. The Baader Meinhof Komplex didn't want Germany to be turned into a construction nightmare where human rights have no value. This is how they felt they should respond to cush plans , which obviously are no longer working in the Germany of today. Unfortunately there were also neo - nazi and neo - fascist groups on the rise in Germany at the same time and this is not covered in this film as it is primarily about the Baader Meinhof Komplex. Were the members and organizers of the group REALLY murderers? Perhaps the most famous scene in the entire film is where one of those corrupt people is approaxed by a riffle carrying woman who , before she shoots the person dead , asks 'what does it feel like when the war you support actually enters your home?'.This question is one of the questions that led to the mass awakening which we are all experiencing now. While some of the neo - nazis and fascists may oppose corporate fascism and related issues , and others may be relatively harmless compared to still some. The arrival of the nazi dictatorship in Germany , soon to be followed by corporate , fascist dictatorship was all predicted by Nostradamus centuries in advance before the events even occured , after all they were so easily predicteable! What all the areas which those events occured on have in common is that several centuries ago they had experienced UFO activity which was painted on numerous paintings of the Virgin Mary and even the Crucifixion and which was later dubbed The Renaissance UFO Wave , or simply te UFO activities during Medieval Times. Almost every one of the places where an artist would come from who depicted objects like this on the canvases which would later become some of Europe's most brilliant masterpieces of world art , has been ransacked , bombed and attacked and in some cases turned into a construction nightmare. No wonder the Baader Meinhof Komplex or most of the corrupt puppet politicians they saught to rid Germany of had never heard of this. Today UFO's are still being seen over the areas where the events that this film is about took  place and many other areas all over Germany , Eastern Europe , Russia and the Balkan countries.And always the citizens of those areas are attacked shortly afterwards during uncontrolleable 'waves'of attack which are connected to phenomena which the orchestrators of those same attacks have had almost no control over and whose origins they have extremely rarely speculated about. Now if we put UFO's and conspiracies out of the picture , the bottom message of the film is this; if we continue to let our children be forced to live in the kind of world that the Baader Meinhof Komplex lived in , then as a species we cannot possibly be justified in terming ourselves civilized.THAT is the bottom line of this film and this message remains as important today as it has ever remained in the past. The honest truth is that most of the adult people on this planet right now hate their children and do not in fact love them - for if they did no matter how much their rantings , ramblings and ravings about love we'd be living in the peaceful world we always wanted to live in. Those were adults who had once been children and who had been made feel they were worthless because they did not belong to any political class , and they were also made feel their environment was worthless , that everything about nature and human emotions around them was worthless also. But they could also have made attempts to resolve those problems without emphasizing the use of all this violence and therefore the abuses of those they killed , who had themselves in some cases been considered even far more abusive by their contemporaries. Naturally such an invasion as turning this planet into a factory and a construction nightmare cannot possibly be considered permisseable during times such as these and yet there are those sick enough to allow others to even make attempts to initiate the process that could lead to the manifestation of such an event. The events of the Baader Meinhof Komplex remind us that sometimes violence has been used to make a point. Sometimes for a reason , sometimes without a reason.Now that the need for the use of violence to make a point in terms of political activity has decreased significantly due to the Consciousness Shift , we find ourselves ever reminded of the dangers and madness of the global society which thrieved prior to the beginning of the actual shift in 1993.As I write , the memory of the Baader Meinhof Komplex still lives on. I saw the first part of this movie entirely in German so that I could get as close as I possibly could to the film , and later I saw the other half subtitled with English subtitles. I learnt vastly much from viewing this film. I feel this film should get many more prizes in terms of acknowledgement of achievement than three oscars. This is indeed one of the best movies ever made during this decade.",5,In a time when 'conspiracy'was a 'politically incorrect'word,1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,6630,"['Not', 'few', 'years', 'ago',

1255221,A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW,B00285WR9M,The Peripatetic Reader,"[0, 0]","Baader Minhoff ComplexThis movie is a riveting, spellbinding portrayal of events that terrorized Europe during the late 70s and early 80s. It also accurately describes the motivations and goals the band of terrorists sought to achieve. It is a powerful enough film to have been a strong contender to win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. Departures, the Japanese entree, won for that year.There was good reason for this nomination. The acting is strong and the film is successful in bringing the viewer back to the turbulent times in the mid to late 70s, early 80s West Germany. It brilliantly captures the revolutionary urgency of the main protagonists and the unsuccessful efforts of the German establishment in attempting to quell the unrest.The German filmmakers clearly had the present political times in consideration when producing this film. The character portrayed by the indomitable Bruno Ganz is the voice of reason and understanding. At one point he is counseling his staff on how to address the bombings, and his character was wise enough to see that the most effective way to counter a terrorist organization is not with bullets or more oppression. That was effectively playing into the terrorists' game because it was calculated to cause more chaos, disorder, and ... terror. No, Ganz's character says, the terrorists' demands must first be understood and addressed. In the case of Baader Minhof, part of their demands were to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian peoples, a topic of main concern then as now. Address that issue and the domestic terrorism will be addressed. This social experiment was never implemented. The film accurately shows how the terrorist group imploded, the principals arrested, jailed, and died in a group suicide pact.

I read part of a book years ago about them entitled ""Hitler's Children."" To that title I still object as it has inaccurate implications.Anyway, when I saw this film was at an indie theatre, I jumped to see it.First, if you have an aversion to violence, you won't like it. Granted, the violence isn't gratuitious. The young people who made up B-M--and their anti-Communist opposition--weren't peace freaks.Indeed, the film starts with some members putting together a bomb.But the film also starts with Ms. Meinhoff, a journalist, and other activists, seeing the German police mercilessly pounding on anti-war activists. I mention that because phenomena such as Baader-Meinhoff--and other activist groups in both hemispheres--didn't develop in a vacuum. And, no, I'm not defending what they did. But they came about because of various actitivies that were going on at the time.Another point that not many other critics point out is that members were essentially middle class and educated. I'm not saying that in a pejorative way, but it was kind of a symptom of many of the lefty organizations in the period, and one facet that I think led to their degree of ideology.It also let to an important scene in the film, when they were training under a middle-east based terrorist organization. Andreas Baader was in a trench, doing what one would assume is characteristic of almost any basic training. He stood up, tired of taking orders from someone else, and said that wasn't for him. While there was some truth to the different mission of the mid-east group from Baader-Meinhoff, there was also Baader's inability to take orders. (I chuckle as I point that out, because I wouldn't have been good at taking orders either!)There was also the trait of B-M members always thinking of themselves as martyrs. One member got into a hunger strike. (In fact, perhaps the most frightening scene in the film is when prison officials were forcing him to eat!) He died, and became the ultimate martyr; other members committed suicide and they were were labled as martyrs.By the end of the film, there was a kind of second generation Baader-Meinhoff. And while I want to give nothing of the plot away, suffice it to say, the first generation felt the second generation had missed the point.This is truly a powerful film. In fact, today I'm ordering the book on which the film is based. It leaves us a lot to think about: B-M's motives, their sanctimony, what about them might have, at least originally, been good. And the acting was superb.If you get a chance to see this film, don't miss it.",5,Well-acted docudrama on German activists turned terrorists,1253836800,"09 25, 2009",2009,2666,"['Yank', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'become', 'aware', 'Baader-Meinhoff', 'were', 'bars', 'read', 'part', 'book', 'years', 'ago', 'entitled', 'Hitler', 'Children', 'title', 'still', 'object', 'inaccurate', 'implications.Anyway', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'indie', 'theatre', 'jumped', 'see', 'it.First', 'have', 'aversion', 'violence', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'Granted', 'violence', ""n't"", 'gratuitious', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'up', 'B-M', 'anti-Communist', 'opposition', 'were', ""n't"", 'peace', 'freaks.Indeed', 'film', 'members', 'putting', 'together', 'bomb.But', 'film', 'also', 'Ms.', 'Meinhoff', 'journalist', 'other', 'activists', 'seeing', 'German', 'police', 'mercilessly', 'pounding', 'anti-war', 'activists', 'mention', 'phenomena', 'such', 'Baader-Meinhoff', 'other', 'activist', 'groups', 'hemispheres', 'did', ""n't"", 'develop', 'vacuum', ""'m"", 'not', 'defending', 'what', 'did', 'came', 'about', 'various', 'actitivies', 'were', 'going', 'time.Another', 'point', 'not', 'many', 'other', 'critics', 'point', 'out', 'members', 'were', 'essentially', 'middle', 'class', 'educated', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'pejorative', 'way', 'was', 'kind', 'symptom', 'many', 'lefty', 'organizations', 'period', 'one', 'facet', 'think', 'led', 'degree', 'ideology.It', 'also', 'let', 'important', 'scene', 'film', 'when', 'were', 'training', 'middle-east', 'based', 'terrorist', 'organization', 'Andreas', 'Baader', 'was', 'trench', 'doing', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'assume', 'characteristic', 'almost', 'basic', 'training', 'stood', 'up', 'tired', 'taking', 'orders', 'someone', 'else', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'truth', 'different', 'mission', 'mid-east', 'group', 'Baader-Meinhoff', 'was', 'also', 'Baader', 'inability', 'take', 'orders', 'chuckle', 'point', 'out', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'good', 'taking', 'orders', 'either', 'was', 'also', 'trait', 'B-M', 'members', 'always', 'thinking', 'martyrs', 'One', 'member', 'got', 'hunger', 'strike', 'fact', 'perhaps', 'most', 'frightening', 'scene', 'film', 'when', 'prison', 'officials', 'were', 'forcing', 'eat', 'died', 'became', 'ultimate', 'martyr', 'other', 'members', 'committed', 'suicide', 'were', 'were', 'labled', 'martyrs.By', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'kind', 'second', 'generation', 'Baader-Meinhoff', 'want', 'give', 'nothing', 'plot', 'away', 'suffice', 'say', 'first', 'generation', 'felt', 'second', 'generation', 'had', 'missed', 'point.This', 'truly', 'powerful', 'film', 'fact', 'today', ""'m"", 'ordering', 'book', 'film', 'based', 'lot', 'think', 'B-M', 'motives', 'sanctimony', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'least', 'originally', 'been', 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'superb.If', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss']",The Baader Meinhof Complex [Region 2]

The Jordanians are serious, disciplined, and quickly irritated by their ""revolutionary"" cousins. Baader and his little circle of friends are themselves turned off by how serious everything is, how much they have to work and behave themselves and, the worst sin to these folks, no coed dorms.If there is a central theme of this film, it's that the Red Army Faction was never about revolution or liberating the opressed. It was more about living out the narcissistic fantasies of priviliged white kids. Don't like America bombing North Vietnam? Blow up a German newspaper! Disgusted by the dull consumerism of capitalist culture? Burn down a department store! Remember, slapping a red star on your reckless vandalism and mass murder makes you just like Che!And don't think this movie is a swipe at the political left. The RAF may quote Mao but they never seem to remember his most important tidbit about how the really succesful geurillas swim in the civilian population like fish in a stream. Instead, they blow up civilians.The kicker comes when they're finally captured (it's not a spoiler if it's history) and immediately get to fussing over their comparatively humane treatment. Reminded me of a fictional MI6 agent saying to a fictional Provo, ""You start a war and then whine about how we fight it."" They put on a good show at their trial, but reality has no concern for egos. Capitalism and imperialism triumph over the Che-wannabes because for all their eagerness to kill the swine, they were still preaching bloody revolution in the heart of Western comfort and privelege.

Director Uli Edel's ""BAADER MEINHOF COMPLEX"" is a look at the events that had transpired between 1967-1977 in West Germany. It chronicles the events that led to the organization of the West German militant group called the Red Army Faction (RAF) by Ulrike Meinhof and Andreas Baader. The film is based on the non-fiction novel written by Stefan Aust. In order to understand what the film is all about, one has to know a little of the events that transpired in Germany during this chaotic period. This period of the 60's was full of political assassinations, a war in Vietnam and that Germany had become divided into Soviet and American controlled sides.During this period, there was a lot of confusion and chaos over the country's citizens, particularly the younger generation. Young people began to despise the older form of government while the older ones disliked the ""free-loving"" and anarchist ways of the newer generation. The ""RAF"" or ""Red Faction Army"" was founded by Ulrike Meinhof, originally intended to be a peaceful but outspoken group of folks but overtime, became a group of militants that were very unorganized that performed political assassinations of Germany's government figures as well as several civilians. The actions of this group helped instigate the events in the 1972 Olympics that was known as the Munich massacre.Our tale begins in 1967 in a nudist beach, as we find Ulrike Meinhof (Martina Gedeck), a proud mother of two kids. Meinhof is a journalist while Andreas Baader is an activist; both of them represent two sides of the Communist government. Agitated by America's involvement in the war in Vietnam and their continued presence in West Germany, students and ideologues gather in the masses to protest the events. These protestations are often met with some brutal police reactions. Ulrike writes articles that praise the protest movement but she never really took a more active role until she meets a disillusioned intellectual side of the equation in the persona of Gudrun Ennslin (Johanna Wokalek), Baader's girlfriend and puts Ulrike in a position to help their cause by breaking out her lover.For the next several years, the Baader-Meinhof collective puts their propaganda in the streets, funding their cause and making a statement by robbing their so-called ""capitalist"" banks and bombing some U.S. army installations. The group gains some public sympathy that turns them into sorts of folk heroes. Now with the German Police led by Horst Herold (Bruno Ganz) on the hunt, the first half of the militant group focuses on terror while the second becomes focused in chronicling the imprisonment of its key leaders while keeping the cause alive. The trials and chaos went on throughout the late 70's.""The Baader Meinhof Complex"" is a docudrama that is driven by the screenplay written by Bernd Eichinger (Downfall) who also co-produced the film. The film's style has that journalistic rigor while keeping its docudrama atmosphere. It was nice to see the filmmakers stick to the book's details rather than attempting to fill in some blanks on their own while avoiding an superfluous viewpoint and heavy directorial editing. The aim of the direction is the flesh out a very despised historical figure while avoiding the politics and emotion behind it. Uli Edel succeeds in some ways, but he does come a little short. Edel uses the film's opening scene to express the free-loving lifestyle that the RAF organizers are so accustomed to; as people who'd rather have their voices heard than resort to violence. Later on, we see the RAF organize themselves and become more aggressive in their delivery of a political standpoint.The film is brilliantly shot, nicely scripted and well-acted. The film approaches its premise with a very methodical manner with the delivery of its narrative and the manner it evolved its characters. The screenplay exhibited a main focus for the present because of the ripples that will affect the future. Director Edel avoids glorifying the killers, actually they are portrayed as confused, arrogant and determined. Meinhof is an intellectual who has the right ideas to enact an approach but lacks the necessary leadership skills to make it effective. She becomes overshadowed by an overzealous activist named Baader who becomes so obsessed in making a statement with no compromise. Meinhof never had the determination to stand up to her convictions while Baader is just so single-minded in purpose. Of course, the dominant figure will always be the leader. I guess ""standing up"" to what you think believe in and what you think is right is a good way to bond with others. The fact is, sometimes we just hear what we want to hear. The RAF fanatically believed that they were doing the right thing and is willing to do reprehensible things to get its message across. Think of Baader and Meinhof as a political ""Bonnie and Clyde"".The film pitches in some key moments in the sixties, and while the set designs and clothing does depict the passage of time; the film moves rather quickly that the viewer never gets to settle in because of the energetic direction that the proceedings were barely convincing that some years have indeed passed (the story spans almost a decade). The film is easy to relate to, since you just have to turn on today's news and you will see that humanity hasn't really progressed past this behavior that can eventually lead to self-annihilation. The filmmakers doesn't push towards any political agenda, but it is refreshing to see terrorists not having the usual turbans in a film. It gives a message that this type of thinking have existed throughout history. The film is quite unnerving and will make some viewers very uncomfortable with its graphic depiction of violence, an abundant display of sex and nudity and political overtones, it presents a very taut pace that generates an aura of suspense.It was a clever move in the part of the filmmakers to show us the events that led to the rise and downfall of the RAF in a detached style that allows the viewer to see that the wrong decision can definitely lead one to ruin. It make one's world turn upside down when we see the disillusionment of the RAF movement. Things like this can only end badly and this film reminds us that when people raise such flawed people to God-like status, they are most likely will be disappointed in what they will find in the end. Humans are flawed and it is always no good to idolize them however seductive and reasonable their arguments may be. ""The Baader Meinhof Komplex"" is an enthralling film; the performances are brilliant and is finely scripted, the only flaw I can see is that because of its disjointed execution, one may forget that the film is based on reality. It would be better if we all remember that mistakes like this can be fatal and disastrous. The film isn't for everyone but definitely worthy of the recognition it attained.Highly Recommended!
