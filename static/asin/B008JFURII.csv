A superb cast has a blast with the plot and the dialogue as the action runs from Kansas to Washington DC to Paris to London to Moscow.Retired spy Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is attempting to live a quiet life with girlfriend Sarah (Mary Louise Parker) in Kansas.  Old and very paranoid friend Marvin (John Malkovich) warns them of the resurrection of a mysterious Cold War plot known as Operation NIGHTSHADE.  Marvin disappears in a car explosion and Frank is taken in for interrogation by the CIA's nasty Jack Horton (Neal McDonough).  Frank will of course escape and go on the run with Sarah and the resilient Marvin.It will turn out that the answers to NIGHTSHADE are inside the head of Dr. Edward Bailey (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant but deranged scientist held incommunicado by Britain's MI-6 for the last thirty years.  Frank, already wanted by the CIA, MI-6, and the KGB, will also have to contend with a paid assassin named Han (Byung-Hun Lee).  He will get help from a former MI-6 operative (Helen Mirren), a former Russian spymaster (Brian Cox), and a former KGB agent and ex-lover (Catherine Zeta-Jones).  Together, they will have to find a reclusive information peddler known as the Frog, sneak into a high security detention area, and break into, and out of, the Kremlin.  The action and suspense are virtually non-stop, and if the plot doesn't necessarily make a lot of sense, it's all tongue-in-cheek good fun, well done by a group of talented actors with impeccable comedic timing.

And everyone else in the theater seemed to like it too.The film has a great cast with good acting.  Great script, screenplay, direction all combine to make this an enjoyable (and yes, fun!) film.Catherine Zeta Jones is great as a Russian General - incredibly hot, she prompts a jealous reaction from Frank Moses' wife (Ms. Parker).  Reprising their roles from RED is Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Mary Louis Parker, and John Malkovich.  Brian Cox rounds out a superb cast.On Rotten Tomatoes, this film garnered just a 42% rating from the critics - this says a lot more about the collective incompetence of the critics, since the film is objectively a fabulous action/adventure/comedy.The bottom line is this: ignore the critics and go see it - especially if you enjoy action/comedy and you enjoyed the first (RED).",5,Yet More Fun . . .,1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,916,"['watched', 'RED', '2', 'Retired', 'Extremely', 'Dangerous', 'local', 'theater', 'Frankly', 'like', 'movie', 'lot', 'everyone', 'else', 'theater', 'seemed', 'like', 'too.The', 'film', 'great', 'cast', 'good', 'acting', 'Great', 'script', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'combine', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'yes', 'fun', 'film.Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'great', 'Russian', 'General', 'incredibly', 'hot', 'jealous', 'reaction', 'Frank', 'Moses', 'wife', 'Ms.', 'Parker', 'Reprising', 'roles', 'RED', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Mary', 'Louis', 'Parker', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'out', 'superb', 'cast.On', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'film', 'garnered', 'just', '42', '%', 'rating', 'critics', 'lot', 'more', 'collective', 'incompetence', 'critics', 'film', 'objectively', 'fabulous', 'action/adventure/comedy.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'ignore', 'critics', 'go', 'see', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'action/comedy', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'RED']",N/A

While this sequel doesn't hold the same charm, it still makes for an entertaining diversion from the anxieties of real life as we're taken globe-trotting around the world for a couple of hours.Ex-CIA Black Ops agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) and his girlfriend (Mary-Louise Parker) find themselves teaming up with their old friends to find a portable nuclear device that went missing. They soon discover they're in a race against time with other organizations wanting to get their hands on the deadly weapon. The adventures take them around the world in their dangerous search as they try to stay alive amongst the crossfire of friends and foes.The audio and video transfers for &#34;Red 2&#34; are wonderful. The movie is presented in 1080p High-Definition (2.40:1). The picture is clean, vibrant, and easy on the eyes. The 7.1 Dolby Digital Surround drops viewers right into the thick of the action with plenty of explosions and gunfire to keep them alert.Some might feel &#34;Red 2&#34; is a little light in the special features department. &#34;The 'Red 2' Experience&#34; takes audiences behind-the-scenes with an array of featurettes centered on the weapons, cast, and stunts in the movie. A gag reel and deleted scenes are the only other items included.&#34;Red 2&#34; is rated PG-13 and with good reason. There's a lot of blood and violence as one would expect from an action/spy thrill-ride. Adult language is used as well. In a world of over-the-top R-rated action flicks, &#34;Red 2&#34; is really a rather tame good time for the mature members of your family.I couldn't help thinking something was missing from &#34;Red 2.&#34; It feels like a reunion with characters you came to love in the original. At the same time you still mourn the absence of Morgan Freeman and Karl Urban. Anthony Hopkins does a relatively good job filling their shoes with his charisma as the scientist who created the lost nuclear device.

1565608,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B008JFURII,FNDNreview,"[8, 20]","Every time a new sequel comes out, it pretty easy to question the driving force behind the reason it's made. Do most sequels need to be made? Naturally, the immediate response would be no, they don't NEED to be made. But, aside from food, water, and a handful of other things, we really don't NEED that much. Make no mistake, there isn't a sequel in the history of film that NEEDED to be made, but when it comes to sequels - it's all about the entertainment value, mixed with a desire to make a bang at the box office. Moviegoers see a good, possibly great film and want more. We didn't NEED The Godfather Part II, but it's difficult to imagine a world where it was never made. The same can be said about a slew of other sequels, like The Empire Strikes Back, Terminator 2, or Aliens. Quite honestly, sequels provide a simple desire to consume more of the same (with the hopes of it being better than or at least as enjoyable as the original). However, not every film deserves a sequel. It's an absolute rarity that a sequel will live up to the original, which is the reason sequels have a reputation of being inferior films. As all of this pertains to yet another comic book sequel, RED 2 - the question becomes: did this film really NEED to be made?Directed by Dean Parisot (Fun with Dick and Jane), RED 2 stars Bruce Willis who reprises his role as Frank Moses, a retired CIA agent attempting to live a normal life. Frank is still dating Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), but the relationship doesn't have the flavor it once did - you know, without the bullets flying through the air. As it turns out, Frank and Marvin (John Malkovich) have a mysterious hit put on them by MI6, which includes their old cohort, Victoria (Helen Mirren) and an ambitious assassin for hire, Han (Byung-hun Lee). It's another average day in the life of Frank Moses as this new adventure takes him and his ""assailants"" around the world to uncover the mystery known as ""Nightshade"" and save the globe from the usual nuclear threat of death and destruction. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Anthony Hopkins, Brian Cox, and Neal McDonough also star in supporting roles.It's no surprise that filmmakers continue to dip into the comic book ""house of ideas."" After all, they provide for a pretty substantial stream of income for the parent company behind it. And, RED is no exception - even though it was a quick three issue ""one-and-done"" limited series (written by Warren Ellis). A film adaption for RED was not entirely unexpected. However, with it being such a brief story (leaving so little to lean on as far as characters and plot direction goes), it's a bit of a surprise that RED even had chatter about the possibility of a sequel. But, that's Hollywood.The first film was fun and quirky (as many films are in the action-comedy genre), yet it's difficult to decipher what more could be done with these characters on the big screen - hence the major issue with this sequel. If you watched RED 2 on a screen right next to RED, you'd basically be watching the same exact movie - only recycled. They both have an identical 2 hour running time, focus heavily on the relationship between Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker's characters, and both rely on John Malkovich for comedic support. While the ""retired and extremely dangerous"" premise was amusing and entertaining the first time around, it's difficult to see the point of the sequel. Sure, it's entertaining - but it's literally a continuation of the same characters doing exactly the same things, only this time they're constantly bouncing from country to country at the snap of a finger. Eventually, the plot becomes clear - but all too predicable - yet the constant jumping from scene to scene (for the first hour or so) makes it difficult to keep track of who is doing what and which character is good or bad. Basically, they sacrifice plot for pointless explosions, cheap one-liners, and a mediocre car chase.Now that the nitpicking is out of the way, it should be noted that the good things about RED 2 certainly outweigh the fact that it's nothing more than a recycled version of the first film. From top to bottom, this cast is smart, funny, and full of chemistry. On his own, John Malkovich carries this film on his back as the slightly-crazed, overzealous side-kick, Marvin. His variety of facial expressions, not to mention his relationship advice, will keep the laughs flowing continuously. And, for some reason - every single time John Malkovich utters the name ""Frank,"" it's a chilling reminder of his role as Mitch Leary in the drama, In the Line of Fire. His co-stars, Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker, provide just enough interest themselves - bickering back and forth as they continue their unorthodox relationship. While Bruce Willis basically has the same role as the first film, Parker is no longer simply along for the ride. She's no CIA agent, but she's at least involved in the action and contributing much more than the last time we saw her. Speaking of action, Byung-hun Lee and his athleticism is always a pleasure to watch.Overall, RED 2 is nothing more than an average action-comedy, using a silly recycled plot and masterful casting to provide a lighthearted, entertaining film. Still, there's very little that separates this film from previous flicks, like Austin Powers, Rush Hour, or Lethal Weapon. Although its predecessor was highly entertaining, RED 2 feels more like an unnecessary sequel that didn't NEED to be made, carrying no other intention than to make a typical studio money grab. Regardless, the plot's constant character misdirection will at least hold your attention and keep you guessing (at least for a while) about who's pulling the strings from the shadows. There's enough comedy, action, and nonsense to fuel this film for the full two hours without making it actually feel like a two hour film. It's entertaining, charming, and completely unrealistic - and oddly enough, absolutely worth the price of admission.GRADE: CFNDNreview.com",3,"The cast is back in the typical action-comedy sequel,

But there is actually some acting which takes place, primarily on the part of Malkovitch! According to what I read it says that #2 stayed in the theaters for four months, which is a good run. By the time I saw it, it was already being set for video, so distribution must not have been extensive. #2 must have been relatively expensive to make, filming in the world's major capitals and blowing up so much stuff! We wish more producers could afford to do this with their films. That said, there's something not quite right about the writing in these films. The major premise of the Red's is that it's OK to murder viciously, as long as the victim deserves it! We have retired CIA people murdering other CIA people who are constantly trying to murder them. It's all OK because secret agents and operatives are evil and deserve to die, which for some odd reason is written to be humorous. And that's the major premise of these films. Watching the older female assassin dissolving a dying agent in nitric acid in the tub, as she jokes on the phone sends an odd message.

The team includes John Malkovich (absolutely hilarious role for him), Mary-Louise Parker (often stealing the show), Helen Mirren (gorgeous as ever and having the time of her life knocking off just about everybody who gets in her way). The other folks who are on varying sides of the law (nobody really plays by the rules) include Anthony Hopkins (in stellar form), Catherine Zeta-Jones, David Thewlis, Brian Cox, Byung-hun Lee (in a brilliantly choreographed martial arts role and the physique to match), Neal McDonough, and Tim Pigott-Smith among others.No, it is not deep, but it is silly and funny and entertaining and an exceptionally good time.

Or else I'll be disappointed I guess, but it sounds a little like the kind of thing someone would say in this movie.There is a lot to like in this film, although really it should be a guilty pleasure.  It's one of those action-comedy movies(with a little romance thrown in) that features killings, torture, explosions, lies and double-crosses, but is so funny mostof the time that you can't take all the violence very seriously.  It's not just Malkovich's character that has the funny one-liners(although I'm sure he had more than anyone else).  Pretty much everyone gets in at least a few good zingers.It's been so long since the first film I had forgotten what RED even STOOD FOR (retired, extremely dangerous).  I alsolearned that ICE can mean something besides Immigration and Customs Enforcement (here, it means Incarcerate,cannot execute)  It also features as central to the story the exposure of a decades-old plot involving a fearsomenuclear weapon made with RED MERCURY!  [This had me scurrying to Wikipedia; it is truly amazing the weird stuffyou can learn from watching movies.  Red mercury actually has featured in a number of sting operations of would-bebuyers of nuclear weapons material.  Most &#34;experts&#34; agree that it does not exist while a few believe it really DOESexist but those who know about it aren't allowed to acknowledge its existence.  Even the name is subject to dispute,as to whether the &#34;red&#34; refers to it first being developed by the Soviets, and others believing it refers to the material'scolor.  In any case there it is: a real-life rumor used as part of the plot.Great cast + fast pace + lots of wry humor + plenty of money for blowing things up and special effects = large entertainmentvalue.  I'll add that I hadn't watched Byung-Hun Lee before; he is a South Korean actor who has had great reviews in non-Hollywood films, and Red 2 is probably his biggest film role (in terms of commercial success).  Although he's over 40, his physique and seemingly boundless energy would have me believing he's far younger, and he was fantastic in his role as a contract killer who (seemingly like everyone in the world of espionage) has a past history with Bruce Willis's character....Not enough good comedy films these days; if you ever like an action/comedy film, you should enjoy this one.",4,Read My Review Or Else!,1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,2347,"['else', 'what', 'else', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'guess', 'little', 'kind', 'thing', 'someone', 'would', 'say', 'movie.There', 'lot', 'like', 'film', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'one', 'action-comedy', 'movies', 'little', 'romance', 'thrown', 'killings', 'torture', 'explosions', 'lies', 'double-crosses', 'so', 'funny', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'violence', 'very', 'seriously', 'not', 'just', 'Malkovich', 'character', 'funny', 'one-liners', ""'m"", 'sure', 'had', 'more', 'anyone', 'else', 'Pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'least', 'few', 'good', 'zingers.It', 'been', 'so', 'long', 'first', 'film', 'had', 'forgotten', 'what', 'RED', 'even', 'STOOD', 'FOR', 'retired', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'alsolearned', 'ICE', 'can', 'mean', 'something', 'Immigration', 'Customs', 'Enforcement', 'here', 'Incarcerate', 'can', 'not', 'execute', 'also', 'central', 'story', 'exposure', 'decades-old', 'plot', 'involving', 'fearsomenuclear', 'weapon', 'made', 'RED', 'MERCURY', '[', 'had', 'scurrying', 'Wikipedia', 'truly', 'amazing', 'weird', 'stuffyou', 'can', 'learn', 'watching', 'movies', 'Red', 'mercury', 'actually', 'featured', 'number', 'sting', 'operations', 'would-bebuyers', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'material', 'Most', '34', 'experts', '34', 'agree', 'not', 'exist', 'few', 'believe', 'really', 'DOESexist', 'who', 'know', 'are', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'acknowledge', 'existence', 'Even', 'name', 'subject', 'dispute', '34', 'red', '34', 'refers', 'first', 'being', 'developed', 'Soviets', 'others', 'believing', ""material'scolor"", 'case', 'real-life', 'rumor', 'used', 'part', 'plot.Great', 'cast', '+', 'fast', 'pace', '+', 'lots', 'wry', 'humor', '+', 'plenty', 'money', 'blowing', 'things', 'up', 'special', 'effects', '=', 'large', 'entertainmentvalue', ""'ll"", 'add', 'had', ""n't"", 'watched', 'Byung-Hun', 'Lee', 'South', 'Korean', 'actor', 'who', 'had', 'great', 'reviews', 'non-Hollywood', 'films', 'Red', '2', 'probably', 'biggest', 'film', 'role', 'terms', 'commercial', 'success', '40', 'physique', 'seemingly', 'boundless', 'energy', 'would', 'have', 'believing', 'far', 'younger', 'was', 'fantastic', 'role', 'contract', 'killer', 'who', 'seemingly', 'everyone', 'world', 'espionage', 'past', 'history', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'character', '.Not', 'enough', 'good', 'comedy', 'films', 'days', 'ever', 'action/comedy', 'film', 'should', 'enjoy', 'one']",N/A

1565758,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B008JFURII,Kenya Starflight,"[0, 0]","The first ""Red"" movie is one of my favorite movies.  It wasn't anything groundbreaking or original and the plot was somewhat convoluted and hazy, but it was still a roaring good time nonetheless, featuring a good mix of action/adventure, humor, and even a bit of romance that was sweet without being sappy or mushy.  A solid cast of stars and good writing certainly helped, and it seemed that everyone involved -- Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Richard Dreyfuss -- was having just as much fun as the audience.  So I was eager to see what a sequel would have in store.As is the case with so many other sequels, I found ""Red 2"" wasn't quite as good as the first movie.  But it's still a fun film, and worth watching if you loved the first.Sarah and Frank (Mary-Louise Parker and Bruce Willis) are trying to settle into a peaceful civilian life together... but Frank's CIA past comes back to bite him when the paranoid lunatic Marvin (John Malkovich) tries to warn them of impending danger.  One car bomb later, Frank goes about rounding up the surviving members of the old team, including the elegant assassin Victoria (Helen Mirren) and the lovestruck Russian informant Ivan (Brian Cox), as well as femme fatale Katya (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a familiar face from his past.  The gang learns that they're being framed for the theft of a powerful nuclear device, and to clear their names they have to find said device and the scientist who developed it (Anthony Hopkins).  But not all is what it seems to be in this mission, and who's an ally and who's a foe turns out to be not so clear...One thing this movie does better than its predecessor is the plot -- it's actually fairly coherent, if not exactly original.  The first ""Red"" movie's main flaw was that the plot was convoluted and often got lost amid the explosions and gunfights, whereas ""Red 2"" has a plot that manages to stay clear despite various double-crosses and subplots that crop up throughout.  And the actors still appear to be enjoying themselves -- even newcomers Zeta-Jones and Hopkins seem to understand exactly what kind of movie they're in, and play their roles deliciously over-the-top.  The one exception is Byung-hun Lee, who plays his role as an assassin with a grudge against Frank fairly straight throughout -- though his maniacally cackling scene with a machine gun lets him cut loose a bit.The new additions to the cast, however, don't gel as well with the returning cast members.  Zeta-Jones felt superfluous in the film, little more than eye candy and a means of causing friction between Frank and Sarah, and her character is pretty superfluous.  Likewise, Lee and Hopkins don't quite fit in with the rest of the cast, and feel oddly out of place among the returning cast members.  This is only to be expected, I suppose, seeing as most viewers grew to love Frank's gang and any newcomers are going to have a hard time winning the hearts of the audience as easily.  I rather missed Joe's presence in the film as well, though having him suddenly come back from the dead to join the rest of the cast would have been impossible to pull off believably.All that said, however, ""Red 2"" is still a lot of fun.  Like the first film, it deftly balances thrilling action sequences and wicked humor, and knows full well that it's not a serious film but a madcap adventure.  And as far as sequels go, it's still a decent film -- not a masterpiece and possibly a step down from the first film, but still fun and well-done.Worth a look if you enjoyed the first movie, or if you just want a good mix of action and comedy that doesn't take itself seriously and has an excellent cast to support it.",4,"Not quite as good as the original, but still fun",1388966400,"01 6, 2014",2014,3693,"['first', 'Red', 'movie', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'groundbreaking', 'original', 'plot', 'was', 'somewhat', 'convoluted', 'hazy', 'was', 'still', 'roaring', 'good', 'time', 'nonetheless', 'featuring', 'good', 'mix', 'action/adventure', 'humor', 'even', 'bit', 'romance', 'was', 'sweet', 'being', 'sappy', 'mushy', 'solid', 'cast', 'stars', 'good', 'writing', 'certainly', 'helped', 'seemed', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'was', 'having', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'audience', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'what', 'sequel', 'would', 'have', 'store.As', 'case', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'sequels', 'found', 'Red', '2', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'movie', 'still', 'fun', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'loved', 'first.Sarah', 'Frank', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'are', 'trying', 'settle', 'peaceful', 'civilian', 'life', 'together', 'Frank', 'CIA', 'past', 'back', 'bite', 'when', 'paranoid', 'lunatic', 'Marvin', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'warn', 'impending', 'danger', 'One', 'car', 'bomb', 'later', 'Frank', 'rounding', 'up', 'surviving', 'members', 'old', 'team', 'including', 'elegant', 'assassin', 'Victoria', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'lovestruck', 'Russian', 'informant', 'Ivan', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'as', 'well', 'femme', 'fatale', 'Katya', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'familiar', 'face', 'past', 'gang', ""'re"", 'being', 'framed', 'theft', 'powerful', 'nuclear', 'device', 'clear', 'names', 'have', 'find', 'said', 'device', 'scientist', 'who', 'developed', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'not', 'what', 'be', 'mission', 'who', 'ally', 'who', 'foe', 'out', 'be', 'not', 'so', 'clear', 'One', 'thing', 'movie', 'better', 'predecessor', 'plot', 'actually', 'fairly', 'coherent', 'not', 'exactly', 'original', 'first', 'Red', 'movie', 'main', 'flaw', 'was', 'plot', 'was', 'convoluted', 'often', 'got', 'lost', 'explosions', 'gunfights', 'Red', '2', 'plot', 'stay', 'clear', 'various', 'double-crosses', 'subplots', 'crop', 'up', 'actors', 'still', 'appear', 'be', 'enjoying', 'even', 'newcomers', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Hopkins', 'seem', 'understand', 'exactly', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', ""'re"", 'play', 'roles', 'deliciously', 'over-the-top', 'one', 'exception', 'Byung-hun', 'Lee', 'who', 'role', 'assassin', 'grudge', 'Frank', 'fairly', 'straight', 'maniacally', 'cackling', 'scene', 'machine', 'gun', 'cut', 'loose', 'bit.The', 'new', 'additions', 'cast', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'gel', 'as', 'well', 'returning', 'cast', 'members', 'Zeta-Jones', 'felt', 'superfluous', 'film', 'little', 'more', 'eye', 'candy', 'means', 'causing', 'friction', 'Frank', 'Sarah', 'character', 'pretty', 'superfluous', 'Likewise', 'Lee', 'Hopkins', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'rest', 'cast', 'feel', 'oddly', 'place', 'returning', 'cast', 'members', 'only', 'be', 'expected', 'suppose', 'seeing', 'most', 'viewers', 'grew', 'love', 'Frank', 'gang', 'newcomers', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'winning', 'hearts', 'audience', 'easily', 'rather', 'missed', 'Joe', 'presence', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'suddenly', 'come', 'back', 'dead', 'join', 'rest', 'cast', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'impossible', 'pull', 'off', 'believably.All', 'said', 'however', 'Red', '2', 'still', 'lot', 'fun', 'first', 'film', 'deftly', 'thrilling', 'action', 'sequences', 'wicked', 'humor', 'full', 'well', 'not', 'serious', 'film', 'madcap', 'adventure', 'as', 'far', 'sequels', 'go', 'still', 'decent', 'film', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'possibly', 'step', 'down', 'first', 'film', 'still', 'fun', 'well-done.Worth', 'look', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'movie', 'just', 'want', 'good', 'mix', 'action', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'excellent', 'cast', 'support']",N/A

It's coming back to me. Bruce Willis is Moses, an aging ex-spy. He's Retired but also Extremely Dangerous (R.E.D.). He's trying to settle down into a comfortable home life with Sarah, one of the most annoying female characters I've ever seen on film. She's played gamely by Mary Louise-Parker, who normally I love, but the character herself is written as this inspid tag-along who constantly causes trouble with her ignorance, but then throws a fit when Moses doesn't want to include her in the espionage or give her a loaded gun. And when she DOES manage to assist with the spy stuff? Why, she does it all by kissing people or being sexy, letting the audience know exactly what we're supposed to think of her: dumb but hot. Her constant bickering and whining with Moses is meant to be funny, but I found it annoying.Moses is joined by an old co-worker, the scatterbrained Marvin who is played perfectly by John Malcovich. He basically steals the show every time he's on the screen. Together, Moses and Marvin must figure out who has recently revived in the public eye an old, failed mission they undertook long ago. Something called Nightshade. Along the way they will encounter a seductive Russian agent (Catherine Zeta-Jones stoutly refusing to do anything even remotely resembling a Russian accent), a brilliant physicist (Anthony Hopkins stealing the show as much as Malcovich), old friends (Helen Mirren openly refusing to take any of this seriously), and old enemies (Lee Byung-hun as a one-note Korean contract killer).These actors all throw themselves into their roles with goofy abandon, providing the only real treat of the film. It's fun enough to watch them mug and smirk their way through the script. The story, however, is uninteresting and vague when it should be its clearest, with the stakes never fully clear for the first half of the plot. By the time things start to make sense, it becomes hard to care too much about the plot, which always feels secondary to the explosions and constant gunfire anyway.&#34;Are we supposed to care about these characters?&#34; my girlfriend asked in the last third of the movie. &#34;I mean, they sure are killing a lot of innocent people who are just doing their jobs.&#34;That's true, too.I'd probably rate the movie higher -- it DOES just want to be a loud, firey, shoot-em-up -- if the dialogue had been tighter, but most of the script reads like a cheesy sitcom. I kept expecting to hear muted trombones quacking after every clunky joke or quirky aside. The film does have its funny moments, but those are mostly in the reaction shots of Malcovich and Willis. I don't think a single line even got me to chuckle.As loud, chaotic, and senseless as a fireball, the film dissipated from my memory as quickly as smoke. It was fun to watch at the time, but a lack of meaningful characters, interesting dialogue, coherent plotting, and relatable protagonists made this film, overall, a mostly forgettable experience.",3,Seeing Red,1385078400,"11 22, 2013",2013,3062,"['just', 'watched', 'movie', 'hour', 'ago', 'can', 'barely', 'remember', 'anything', 'it.Oh', 'wait', 'coming', 'back', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Moses', 'aging', 'ex-spy', 'Retired', 'also', 'Extremely', 'Dangerous', 'R.E.D.', 'trying', 'settle', 'down', 'comfortable', 'home', 'life', 'Sarah', 'one', 'most', 'annoying', 'female', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'played', 'gamely', 'Mary', 'Louise-Parker', 'who', 'normally', 'love', 'character', 'written', 'inspid', 'tag-along', 'who', 'constantly', 'trouble', 'ignorance', 'then', 'fit', 'when', 'Moses', ""n't"", 'want', 'include', 'espionage', 'give', 'loaded', 'gun', 'when', 'manage', 'assist', 'spy', 'stuff', 'Why', 'kissing', 'people', 'being', 'sexy', 'letting', 'audience', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'think', 'dumb', 'hot', 'constant', 'bickering', 'whining', 'Moses', 'meant', 'be', 'funny', 'found', 'joined', 'old', 'co-worker', 'scatterbrained', 'Marvin', 'who', 'played', 'perfectly', 'John', 'Malcovich', 'basically', 'show', 'time', 'screen', 'Together', 'Moses', 'Marvin', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'recently', 'revived', 'public', 'eye', 'old', 'failed', 'mission', 'undertook', 'long', 'ago', 'Something', 'called', 'Nightshade', 'way', 'will', 'encounter', 'seductive', 'Russian', 'agent', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'stoutly', 'refusing', 'do', 'anything', 'even', 'remotely', 'resembling', 'Russian', 'accent', 'brilliant', 'physicist', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'stealing', 'show', 'as', 'much', 'Malcovich', 'old', 'friends', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'openly', 'refusing', 'take', 'seriously', 'old', 'enemies', 'Lee', 'Byung-hun', 'one-note', 'Korean', 'contract', 'killer', '.These', 'actors', 'throw', 'roles', 'goofy', 'abandon', 'providing', 'only', 'real', 'treat', 'film', 'fun', 'enough', 'watch', 'mug', 'smirk', 'way', 'script', 'story', 'however', 'uninteresting', 'vague', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'clearest', 'stakes', 'never', 'fully', 'clear', 'first', 'half', 'plot', 'time', 'things', 'start', 'make', 'sense', 'hard', 'care', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'always', 'feels', 'secondary', 'explosions', 'constant', 'gunfire', 'anyway.', '34', 'Are', 'supposed', 'care', 'characters', '34', 'girlfriend', 'asked', 'last', 'third', 'movie', '34', 'mean', 'sure', 'are', 'killing', 'lot', 'innocent', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'doing', 'jobs.', '34', 'true', 'too.I', ""'d"", 'probably', 'rate', 'movie', 'higher', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'loud', 'firey', 'shoot-em-up', 'dialogue', 'had', 'been', 'tighter', 'most', 'script', 'cheesy', 'sitcom', 'kept', 'expecting', 'hear', 'muted', 'trombones', 'quacking', 'clunky', 'joke', 'quirky', 'aside', 'film', 'have', 'funny', 'moments', 'are', 'mostly', 'reaction', 'shots', 'Malcovich', 'Willis', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'single', 'line', 'even', 'got', 'chuckle.As', 'loud', 'chaotic', 'senseless', 'fireball', 'film', 'dissipated', 'memory', 'as', 'quickly', 'smoke', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'time', 'lack', 'meaningful', 'characters', 'interesting', 'dialogue', 'coherent', 'plotting', 'relatable', 'protagonists', 'made', 'film', 'overall', 'mostly', 'forgettable', 'experience']",N/A

Bruce Willis in the title role of Frank Moses carried the part of with perfection as did his fantastic supporting cast. With the exception of Morgan Freeman they all return for this sequel that, like most sequels, doesn't quite live up to the original but still offers a good night at the movies.This time around Moses and his now girlfriend Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) are settling into being a mundane average couple which he relishes but bores her to tears. One day at Costco they're approached by ex-spy Marvin (John Malkovich) who tells them he needs their help. Not wanting to put Sarah into harms way Frank turns him down only to see him blown up moments later.But Frank isn't convinced that he's actually been killed and rightly so. When a group of agents captures Frank for an interrogation it is Marvin who rescues him. Not long after their friend Victoria (Helen Mirren) calls to let them know that MI-6 has given her a contract to kill her and the US has given the same contract to old foe Han (Byung-hun Lee). On the road the threesome do their own form of interrogation and discover that an old project they were involved in back in the seventies has spy agencies all over trying to track them down. Word has leaked they know something they don't and now the only way to survive is to find that information.Their search takes them around the world beginning in Paris where they run into Katja (Catherine Zeta-Jones). A top Russian spy she was often the weakness that Frank fell for. Whether she is there to help or hinder the group slowly unveils itself. In any event she puts Frank and Sarah at odds as any old flame would if she suddenly showed.Eventually the group discovers that the project they were a part of involved a nuclear device that was smuggled in to Russia during the Cold War. Now it seems someone is trying to track down the device and activate it or at least take possession of it to use elsewhere. Just who is behind it all gets confusing at times and the end result isn't something you see coming at first.Included this time around is Anthony Hopkins as Bailey, the weapons designer who created the bomb in the first place. His character offers some comic relief as he seems to be either out of his mind or heavily drugged by his captors. Either way he gives a new character some life that is up to the standards set by the rest of the cast.While the movie offers less reality and tends to offer action along the lines of it's original format (i.e. a comic book), it doesn't matter. What it offers is spectacular entertainment from start to finish. The only thing that slows this film down is the constant jump from one country to another but each country they visit offers more obstacles to overcome which they do in grand scale.There isn't a bad performance in this film. Standing out is Malkovich as Marvin. Malkovich is known more for his performance in heavier material but does a tremendous job being the comic foil to Willis' hard knocks hero. The only thing I was disappointed in was the parts offered Miller and Mirren. Both seem underused here but then maybe that's just my perspective.All in all this is a fun movie that you can enjoy with a big bowl of popcorn. Just sit back and go for the ride, have some fun. I'm not sure yet if I would qualify this one to sit on the shelf in my collection but it is well worth watching.",4,RED ROUND TWO,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,3532,"['saw', 'movie', 'RED', 'then', 'know', 'amount', 'fun', 'was', 'be', 'had', 'story', 'retired', 'CIA', 'agent', 'designated', 'RED', 'Retired', 'Extremely', 'Dangerous', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'title', 'role', 'Frank', 'Moses', 'carried', 'part', 'perfection', 'did', 'fantastic', 'supporting', 'cast', 'exception', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'return', 'sequel', 'most', 'sequels', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'original', 'still', 'good', 'night', 'movies.This', 'time', 'Moses', 'now', 'girlfriend', 'Sarah', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'are', 'settling', 'being', 'mundane', 'average', 'couple', 'tears', 'One', 'day', 'Costco', ""'re"", 'approached', 'ex-spy', 'Marvin', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'who', 'help', 'Not', 'wanting', 'put', 'Sarah', 'harms', 'way', 'Frank', 'down', 'only', 'see', 'blown', 'up', 'moments', 'later.But', 'Frank', ""n't"", 'convinced', 'actually', 'been', 'killed', 'rightly', 'so', 'When', 'group', 'agents', 'captures', 'Frank', 'interrogation', 'Marvin', 'who', 'Not', 'long', 'friend', 'Victoria', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'let', 'know', 'MI-6', 'given', 'contract', 'kill', 'US', 'given', 'same', 'contract', 'old', 'foe', 'Han', 'Byung-hun', 'Lee', 'road', 'threesome', 'do', 'own', 'form', 'interrogation', 'discover', 'old', 'project', 'were', 'involved', 'back', 'seventies', 'spy', 'agencies', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'Word', 'leaked', 'know', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'now', 'only', 'way', 'survive', 'find', 'information.Their', 'search', 'world', 'beginning', 'Paris', 'where', 'run', 'Katja', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'top', 'Russian', 'spy', 'was', 'often', 'weakness', 'Frank', 'fell', 'Whether', 'there', 'help', 'hinder', 'group', 'slowly', 'event', 'Frank', 'Sarah', 'odds', 'old', 'flame', 'would', 'suddenly', 'showed.Eventually', 'group', 'project', 'were', 'part', 'involved', 'nuclear', 'device', 'was', 'smuggled', 'Russia', 'Cold', 'War', 'Now', 'someone', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'device', 'activate', 'least', 'take', 'possession', 'use', 'elsewhere', 'Just', 'who', 'confusing', 'times', 'end', 'result', ""n't"", 'something', 'see', 'coming', 'first.Included', 'time', 'around', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Bailey', 'weapons', 'designer', 'who', 'created', 'bomb', 'first', 'place', 'character', 'comic', 'relief', 'be', 'mind', 'heavily', 'drugged', 'captors', 'way', 'new', 'character', 'life', 'up', 'standards', 'set', 'rest', 'cast.While', 'movie', 'less', 'reality', 'offer', 'action', 'lines', 'original', 'format', 'i.e', 'comic', 'book', ""n't"", 'matter', 'What', 'spectacular', 'entertainment', 'start', 'finish', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'down', 'constant', 'jump', 'one', 'country', 'country', 'visit', 'offers', 'more', 'obstacles', 'overcome', 'do', 'grand', 'scale.There', ""n't"", 'bad', 'performance', 'film', 'Standing', 'out', 'Malkovich', 'Marvin', 'Malkovich', 'known', 'more', 'performance', 'heavier', 'material', 'tremendous', 'job', 'being', 'comic', 'foil', 'Willis', 'hard', 'knocks', 'hero', 'only', 'thing', 'was', 'disappointed', 'was', 'parts', 'offered', 'Miller', 'Mirren', 'seem', 'underused', 'here', 'then', 'maybe', 'just', 'perspective.All', 'fun', 'movie', 'can', 'enjoy', 'big', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'Just', 'sit', 'back', 'go', 'ride', 'have', 'fun', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'yet', 'would', 'qualify', 'one', 'sit', 'shelf', 'collection', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

My husband and I both agreed that ""Red 2"" was even better than the first ""Red."" However, he was undecided at first about who was his favorite character. This was because Bruce Willis and Louise Parker elegantly played a couple very much in love and playing out their relationship among various heists. Lee Byung-hun gave a marvelous performance as a gifted assassin who deep down has a good sense of right and wrong. However, my husband admitted that he enjoyed Anthony Hopkins in the role as Dr. Edward Bailey the most. This was because Hopkins gave an admirable performance as a physicist who is called upon for his talents. My favorite performances were a tie between Helen Mirren as Victoria Winters and John Malkovich as Marvin Boggs. Mirren gives a splendid performance as a trained and true femme fatale who still has a heart for her fellow friends while accomplishing her duties in an efficient manner (there is a comical scene where she is portraying the queen of England). My husband also liked Mirren's performance, but more for her flirty demeanor and her elegant style while doing one of her jobs (there is a scene where she is aiming her gun in a stylish outfit and letting her boyfriend touch her feet). I enjoyed Malkovich's commendable performance as Boggs because he plays a man with the right touch of paranoia who also is a skilled mediator for his fellow colleagues/friends. There are also electrifying scenes in the movie where the characters are shown traveling to England, France, and Russia.

Most of these follow-up movies are lacking in some area, whether it&#8217;s story or script, or even a miscasting of the characters.  But RED 2 does not fall anywhere into this category of part-two-hell.  Instead, this sequel takes the franchise to another level.  The result is a highly entertaining film full of laughs and rapid-fire action.&#8232;I enjoyed the first RED a lot, as did my whole family.  We liked how the humor was mixed skillfully with the action, which in turn made us laugh and even cringe in certain places.  But RED 2 gives this and so much more.  I can honestly say this is one of the few films that actually transcends its predecessor.RED 2 is shot well and looks amazing onscreen.  But two primary components make this movie a huge hit:  the story and the acting.  The plot is very interesting and is filled with twists and turns.  But even so, my youngest (who is 10) did not have a problem following what was happening.  The storyline is great and intricate, but it does not overwhelm the audience in the least.The acting is also a huge plus for this film.  Bruce Willis returns as the main hero, Frank Moses.  And with him, as before, are John Malkovich, the enchanting Helen Mirren, and Mary-Louise Parker.  But we are also treated to newcomers like Anthony Hopkins, Catharine Zeta-Jones and  Byung-hun Lee.  This star-studded ensemble blends perfectly onscreen, giving a cast that any filmmaker would sell his soul to work with.RED 2 is a massive win for me and I hope director Dean Parisot considers making a third film; I would definitely give it a look.  I recommend giving this one a shot, especially if you haven&#8217;t seen the first RED.  I suggest getting both and making a night of them.

Red 2 is more of the same but, in my opinion, done a bit better.  If you enjoy the first Red you should enjoy this film.  I did not enjoy the first Red, despite some good performances, but I did end up enjoying this one.  I found it a bit funnier, the villain is much better, and the action scenes are vastly improved from the first one.  However, the film still has many of the problems that Red had that drag the movie down.There are many things that the film has going for it.  First off most of the main cast returns here like Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Brian Cox, etc.  We also have new cast members joining in like Anthony Hopkins, Byung-hun Lee, and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Everyone does a good job performance wise.  John Malkovich and Anthony Hopkins practically steal the show.  They steal every scene they are in.  John Malkovich was the best part of the first movie, and he is one of the best parts of this movie.  Anthony Hopkins is great in everything he is in whether it is bad or not.  Catherine Zeta-Jones does a good job too.  I&#8217;m glad that she is getting more work.  I like how she plays off Bruce Willis in the film.  I think that they have better chemistry than Bruce and Sarah Ross.Byung-hun Lee as Han was also great.  He was my third favorite character in the film.  Han&#8217;s character is basically what Karl Urban&#8217;s character was in the first movie, except Han, in my opinion, is much better.  He is also quite funny and has the best action scenes in the film.The action is ramped up in this which is definitely a plus.  I thought that the action in the first movie was mediocre at best.  The final action scene in particular was rather lame.  In this movie the final action scene is much more fun and intense.  It felt like there was much more at stake and it was more of a sense of challenge and urgency for the main characters which was lacking in the first film.  The effects were much better as well.  I also like more diverse locations.  The last film took place in many locations as well, but only confined to the United States.  Here we go from America to London, to Russia, then back to London again.  I cannot comment on the 3D since I did not see the film in 3D.There are still many problems with the film.  First off the Mary-Louise Parker (Sarah Ross) character still annoys me.  In fact I find her more annoying here than in the last film.  Like in the first movie out of all the characters I find her gags to be the weakest and not funny at all.  Granted she does have more to do here and she does have a nice moment near the end.  However, she is still annoying and has to be saved multiple times again.  Since she is a main character it becomes a major issue and brings the movie down for me considerably.  Again, she felt out of place and should not have been in the movie.Another thing that bothered me was this CIA agent played by Neal McDonough.  He was played up as a major threat at the start of the film, but then becomes basically a throwaway character after that, which was weak.  You cannot introduce a badass character in the beginning then just throw him away like that.Overall, if you are a fan of the first Red then you should enjoy yourself.  Even if you did not care for the first movie you might like this.  I did not like Red but enjoyed Red 2 despite its problems.",3,"Better Than The First Film, but Still Not Great!",1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,3508,"['Red', 'Retired', 'Extremely', 'Dangerous', 'was', 'about', 'retired', 'agents', 'being', 'hunted', 'CIA', 'having', 'step', 'out', 'retirement', 'kick', 'ass', 'once', 'again', 'Red', '2', 'more', 'same', 'opinion', 'done', 'bit', 'better', 'enjoy', 'first', 'Red', 'should', 'enjoy', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'first', 'Red', 'good', 'performances', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'enjoying', 'one', 'found', 'bit', 'funnier', 'villain', 'much', 'better', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'vastly', 'improved', 'first', 'one', 'However', 'film', 'still', 'many', 'problems', 'Red', 'had', 'drag', 'movie', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'film', 'going', 'First', 'most', 'main', 'cast', 'returns', 'here', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'etc', 'also', 'have', 'new', 'cast', 'members', 'joining', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Byung-hun', 'Lee', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Everyone', 'good', 'job', 'performance', 'wise', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'practically', 'steal', 'show', 'steal', 'scene', 'are', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'first', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'great', 'everything', 'bad', 'not', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'good', 'job', 'too', '8217', 'glad', 'getting', 'more', 'work', 'how', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'film', 'think', 'have', 'better', 'chemistry', 'Bruce', 'Sarah', 'Ross.Byung-hun', 'Lee', 'Han', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'was', 'third', 'favorite', 'character', 'film', 'Han', '8217', 's', 'character', 'basically', 'what', 'Karl', 'Urban', '8217', 's', 'character', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'Han', 'opinion', 'much', 'better', 'also', 'quite', 'funny', 'best', 'action', 'scenes', 'film.The', 'action', 'ramped', 'up', 'definitely', 'plus', 'thought', 'action', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'mediocre', 'best', 'final', 'action', 'scene', 'particular', 'was', 'rather', 'lame', 'movie', 'final', 'action', 'scene', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'intense', 'felt', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'stake', 'was', 'more', 'sense', 'challenge', 'urgency', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'lacking', 'first', 'film', 'effects', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'more', 'diverse', 'locations', 'last', 'film', 'took', 'place', 'many', 'locations', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'confined', 'United', 'States', 'Here', 'go', 'America', 'London', 'Russia', 'then', 'back', 'London', 'again', 'can', 'not', 'comment', '3D', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'film', '3D.There', 'are', 'still', 'many', 'problems', 'film', 'First', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'Sarah', 'Ross', 'character', 'still', 'fact', 'find', 'more', 'annoying', 'here', 'last', 'film', 'first', 'movie', 'characters', 'find', 'gags', 'be', 'weakest', 'not', 'funny', 'Granted', 'have', 'more', 'do', 'here', 'have', 'nice', 'moment', 'end', 'However', 'still', 'annoying', 'be', 'saved', 'multiple', 'times', 'again', 'main', 'character', 'major', 'issue', 'movie', 'down', 'considerably', 'Again', 'felt', 'place', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'movie.Another', 'thing', 'bothered', 'was', 'CIA', 'agent', 'played', 'Neal', 'McDonough', 'was', 'played', 'up', 'major', 'threat', 'start', 'film', 'then', 'basically', 'throwaway', 'character', 'was', 'weak', 'can', 'not', 'introduce', 'badass', 'character', 'beginning', 'then', 'just', 'throw', 'away', 'that.Overall', 'are', 'fan', 'first', 'Red', 'then', 'should', 'enjoy', 'Even', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'first', 'movie', 'might', 'like', 'did', 'not', 'Red', 'enjoyed', 'Red', '2', 'problems']",N/A

A collection of past-their-prime actors play roles of former intelligence agents brought back into the global fight for right vs. wrong.  Morgan Freeman is missing in this outing but is replaced by Catherine Zeta-Jones as a Russian KGB agent.  At least she's better to look at.Frank (Bruce Willis) is playing house with Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) and the film opens in a Costco proving the couple is trying to adapt to regular life.  It doesn't last long.  In a convoluted story, an experimental nuclear weapon, built by an imprisoned scientist (Anthony Hopkins joins the party), is about to fall into the wrong hands.  Marvin (funny as ever John Malkovich) reappears to recruit Frank, and Sarah comes along for the ride.Things get further complicated as Frank's old partner, Victoria (Helen Mirren), has been hired to kill him.  Then there is Han Cho Bai (Byung-hun Lee) who is also out to kill Frank to settle some old grievance.  And the aforementioned Katja (Zeta-Jones) who just happens to be an old girlfriend of Frank's has her own agenda.  The gang continues to have fun with the premise, but the film is long on comedy and short on substance.  The death toll is in the hundreds, most killed with a casualness that is a bit silly.Frank can still kick ass as can Victoria.  Sarah is a quick learner.  Marvin is as smart as he is funny.  Neal McDonough plays the bad guy who is also well placed in the U. S. government.  He seems to want to challenge Willis in the battle of one-liners.  This is all just a retread of the original, even if it isn't hard to watch.  I understand there are more sequels coming.I actually watched this movie on a Netflix Blu ray disc rental.  The video resolution was 1080p and had an aspect ratio of 2.40:1.  The disc had a nice film-like quality.  Some of the locations featured nice outside settings and the colors all looked very good.  I did think some of the car chase sequences were overloaded with obvious CGI.  Overall the transfer was crisp and clear with no issues.  While I've gotten Netflix rentals before that left out an extras (mostly recent blockbusters), this is the first time I was shortchanged on the audio.  If you buy the disc you will get a DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 track.  My copy only had Dolby Digital 5.1.  While it sounded fine, it wasn't the uncompressed audio I was expecting.

Where there is virtually no plot and the actors simply give up acting and just become paper cut outs of their roles in prior movies, hamming it up with each other. The acting in Red 2 is not bad, it's atrocious.I really like to watch Bruce Willis. His lopsided grin and cool aplomb in movie where missiles and bullets are flying around him, and he is totally beat up, is usually fun. Not in this movie. His character is wooden and boring. He seems half asleep, or in a Prozac fog most of the time.Mary Louise Parker is constantly and annoyingly mugging. I don't know what John Malkovich actually does in this film, except just acting like a moron. I guess his role is supposed to be the guy rescuing the cardboard cutout of Bruce Willis that constantly falls into bad situations. Zeta Jones doesn't look or act like a Russian agent. Her hairdo (or wig probably) actually makes her look unattractive-a hard thing to actually do with this beautiful talented actress. The only slightly bright spots are Helen Mirin and Anthony Hopkins who are funny enough for a yuk or 2.And then there's the plot. I'm still somewhat confused.

John Malkovich steals the show as ""Mad"" Marvin and does as much acting with his face as with the dialog.  Helen Mirren is clearly having the time of her life playing Victoria and she is great.  Anthony Hopkins as the mad scientist plays it to the hilt.  Byung-hun Lee as the assassin hired to kill Willis is marvelous in his incredible fight scenes plus adding some real subdued humor about his plane. Also he introduces the new Gatling gun just released by the Army and that scene alone is worth the price of admission.

But hardly the greatest movie I'd ever seen. It was mildly amusing and I chuckled a few times at the jokes. The action sequences were a bit over-blown and so all-in-all I thought it was just okay. Worth seeing once. Watching films at the cheapie theater all the time a while back, I kept seeing advertisements for this movie even though it was already out. I figured I would see it when it came to the cheap theater, but never got around to it. Then I figured I'd check it out at the library. The wait was long. But I finally got around to seeing this movie. And I was shocked, SHOCKED by how much I like this film.The first one was amusing, this one is hilariousFirst thing is first, you don't really need to see the first RED in order to watch this one. All you need to know is, there's a bunch of spies who are in retirement but are considered R.E.D. ""retired extremely dangerous"". One of them got himself a girlfriend and through a series of traumatizing adventures she found out all about him and decided to stay with him anyway. And thus the stage is set for a sequel. The first film seemed to a have a rather dark tone compared to this one, which is quite frankly absolutely ridiculous most of the time. There is violence in this film but it's far more cartoonish on the whole than the first film.I don't even remember the plot of the first RED (did it have one?). This sequel has your usual by-the-number secret scientist/secret weapon/chase the macguffin plot. It is however very well done and extremely entertaining. This is because pretty much EVERYONE in this film is likable and hilarious every second they are on film. Take the wife/girlfriend trying to act the spy who is hilarious, over-the-top and believable (she actually has talents, just like a real human being, as opposed to some damsel-in-distress stereotype). Her relationship with the other main character is charming and silly and laugh-out-loud funny rather than the groan-inducing stereotype that most films feature. Then there's the exotic-ex femme fatale, the goofy best friend, the wacky scientist, and the always incredibly charming and way-too-hot-to-be-your-grandmother Helen Mirren. Everyone is going to like at least one of the good guys in this film, and probably most with love them all.Honestly, if you like dark humor, action films, ANY of the stars of this film, spy films, or just a good comedy, you owe it to yourself to give this one a watch. It is superbly written, delightfully acted, ridiculously entertaining, and wonderfully big-hearted.

1566070,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B008JFURII,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","In 2010, DC Comics introduced the world to one of it's lesser known series, R.E.D. (Retired Extremely Dangerous). What I loved about that film was that it took old school action stars and put them into a modern action movie. The expectations for action movies are much higher today, no longer are they just chases, explosions, and gun fights. Today, people expect action films to have some kind of story, characters with personality, and even some humor. RED delivered all that and more and so does it sequel. Even though there are some bigger names in RED's second installment, the humor didn't play as big a role as it did previously and the story moved a lot faster. To some, this may have been a good thing, but for me, too much happened too quickly. I liked it better when we didn't know the characters or what to expect from them, when things were explained, and not just delved into. The first film made RED seem very original, but it's sequel really does play like a story that was adapted from a comic. Don't get me wrong though, while the second film doesn't compare to the first, it is still far better than some of the other action films released lately. You really can't go wrong in having an action film that stars Bruce Willis and John Malkovich, they seem to just be oblivious to the signs of aging and are as believable today as they were in their prime. Alone, this pair would have been terrific, but you add true legends of the screen like Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirran to the cast, and honestly, I don't see how any movie fan would want to miss that! The acting is terrific and the story, while proceeding much too quickly, was still a pretty interesting one.

What I liked most was the mix of comedy and action. It was consistent throughout the movie and everything blended smoothly.Synopsis: Frank Moses/Willis has a new life with his girlfriend Sarah/ML Parker but is sidetracked when the government puts out a hit on him and Marvin/Malkovich and declares them terrorist. Apparently Frank and Marvin had some involvement regarding a project during WWII called &#34;Nightshade.&#34; Moses and crew are thrust into a wild ride across the planet to fix everything.Action: Fight scenes are great and well done. An excellent car chase. Several gun battles. All the main actors in this movie get their chance to shine.I really enjoyed watching VIctoria/Mirren. She totally kicks butt and can handle her guns. Han/Byung-hun Lee adds a little KungFu action.Acting/Writing: Most of the time I separate acting and writing. Not this time. Usually, when a lot of top notch actors get together, the movie suffers in many other areas, especially writing. Not in this movie. Everyone worked well together. Everyone got their funny moments and there were plenty. Unlike a lot of movies I have watched recently, this movie did not have to rely upon vulgarity nor profanity.Family friendly: Very little cursing. Lots of killing/shooting/fighting. No nekkid people nor sexual stuff. So, basically the violence is the worst.If I had to pick one negative about this movie it would be Sarah/Parker. I found her to be a wee bit annoying. She seemed out of place.This movie is well worth the rental. One of the better movies I have seen this year. I rarely give 5 stars to a movie, However, since this movie shines above the competition with great acting/writing/action, it is getting the full 5.",5,This movie has it all.

I mean,Malcolm McDowellplays the sane psychopath as well as any, and has a four-decade-+ career doing so. But really, with the possible exception of Jack Nicholson, who really makes you believe it? On the other hand, Mirren dominates any stage she walks onto. And Willis has his smart-alecky presence. And Malkovich has this bizarre role that he lives in an utterly convincing way, and being convinced it what makes it so scary.Despite any unbelievability your might find, and there's a bunch, this comes together in a wholly satisfying spy/adventure/slapstick combination that defies easy description except that it works.
