Downes ""downfall4""","[3, 5]","I tried to like this because this is normally the type of movie that I would choose to view and I am a Diane Lane fan, but this movie did not impress me.  Diane Lane plays a fairly submissive role.  She doesn't sparkle or shine, and neither does the cinematographer's rendition of the Tuscan countryside. There are some pretty scenes, but they don't carry over to set the mood for the film as they should. Certainly not enough to redeem this movie above standard fare. There are several likeable characters in the movie. I especially enjoyed the older,handsome,but unfortunately married real estate agent.  I felt for Ms. Lane's character - too bad he was taken!  I haven't read the book, but I read a review that said that actually the main character and her husband renovated the house in Tuscany (not the new divorcee on her own looking for love and fulfillment), so maybe that's why this movie falls short -too much artistic license.  In any case, you might enjoy this light movie, or you might be disappointed, but if you like Diane Lane's natural beauty and intensity, you should see &quot;A Walk On the Moon&quot; (one of my favorite movies)and &quot;Unfaithful&quot;.

Granted, Hollywood has done that with certain minorities before, but this best friend hardly filled any stereotype.

786721,A5S3BAWLNT10P,B0000VD02Y,Amazon Customer,"[9, 15]","A while ago we saw Diane Lane give a terrific performance in the movie ""Unfaithful"", which was a remake of Claude Chabrol's ""La Femme Infidel"". The film itself was uneven, but Diane Lane was so good as the straying wife that she was nominated for an Academy Award.In ""Under The Tuscan Sun"" Diane Lane once again gives a very good performance. The problem is that ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is not even half the film that ""Unfaithful"" was.  I don't really like defining movies as chick flicks or otherwise, but there's really no other way to describe this one. And it's a movie for not very discerning chicks at that.It's based on Francis Mayes book of the same name, a book that hit the bestseller lists largely because it was the stuff of many a middle-class fantasy: one day I'm going to walk away from all this and get back to a simpler live in the countryside of Provence, or Sardinia, or Greece, or Tuscany.The book has its devoted fans. It also has its ardent critics, most of whom were put off by Francis Mayes' egocentricity and her somewhat patronising view of the quaint locals. So self-involved is the writer that many readers can't even figure out who the mysterious man is that is accompanying her as the villa in Tuscany gets renovated. A husband? A lover? Or what?Well, whatever he is Audrey Wells, the writer and director of the film didn't want him around. She felt that the story of a couple renovating a house didn't have enough dramatic potential, so in this version Diane Lane's character discovers her husband has been unfaithful, divorces him, and heads off to Italy to rebuild her life and her heart. That, of course, makes this all very much a chick flick. It even has all the clich&eacute;s that such a film should have. Jokes about women's liking for chocolate. The gay best friend Patti (played by Sandra Oh). In fact there's a whole coach load of gay friends in this one. There's the old meet cute. There's the woman who is divorced but whom virtually every man seems to fancy. There's a childbirth scene. And a wedding scene. And of course there's the dashing European, Marcello (Raoul Bova), who is just as fickle as the husband she has just divorced but who is revealed to be not quite so nasty because ... well ... he's continental. When a married Italian guy or two go after our heroine, it's OK because they are European and it's expected. When her American husband does the same thing it's grounds for divorce. And of course, you just know that this estrogen fest has to have a new and more long lasting love in it somewhere, even if that love does take a long time to turn up. There's also a character who's intended to be one of the girlz in a ""Sex and the City"" kind of way, but is actually quite a sad case, something the movie avoids pointing except for one brief scene, and then takes back by the end.It's awful.I'm sorry. I know that some women who want solace for the soul or the broken heart may get something from it. But it's a terrible movie. It's all so calculating and by the numbers. I don't think a romantic movie clich&eacute; is missed from beginning to end, although they're also all overlaid here with a kind of half baked politically correct liberalism. Do women really want a Latin lover who says, and I'm not kidding: ""I am going to make love all over you"". I've seen porn movies like that that, but is this really the stuff of romance?But you should know what to expect. Audrey Wells previously wrote that other major victimised chick flick: ""The Truth About Cats and Dogs."" That's another film that some women found a devastating reflection of men's simple minded obsession with physical beauty without realising that it was actually ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" in reverse, and thus just as critical of the distaff side as of testosterone poisoned males.I can't even say, for ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" that it's beautifully photographed. Geoffrey Simpson is the cinematographer. But Tuscany is so beautiful that no one could help capturing some of its beauties, or if they could they should be shot, and not merely by a camera.The only reason to watch ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is the luminous Diane Lane.""The film itself is terrible, and manipulative, but if you're willing to sit through all this nonsense for a wonderful performance by the beautiful, but by Hollywood terms over the hill, Diane Lane, you might get something from it.

Diane Lane shines portraying a broken woman picking up the pieces of her life. Not only do you fall in love with beautiful Tuscany, you get a taste of Italian custom and culture as well. With a plot that holds true to real life situations if you are brave enough to take chances, this story is a perfect tale of casting aside your fears and insecurities and taking chances even when you feel like giving up. Frances takes a leap of faith and buys a rustic villa in Tuscany in serious need of a fixing up after a life altering event...a dreaded divorce. After a failed relationship Francis yearns to find love again. She meets a couple different men that help her on the way. As most of us know, you learn from every relationship before finding ""the one.""

786726,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0000VD02Y,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I'm in love with Diane Lane.  I honestly wish that her career post-Oscar nomination would have been slightly better (or a whole lot better) than what it was, but I'm just happy that she's still working, and she really does bring a lot to what she does.  The year following her Oscar nominated turn in `Unfaithful' (where she should have won in a cakewalk) she put out one of those standard chick-flick type rom-coms that get made every other month.  Basically the `Eat Pray Love' of the 2000's (just far less muddled and unfocused), `Under the Tuscan Sun' is basic and predictable and yet elevated thanks to Lane's dedicated performance that the focus brought to fleshing out the depth in the story.The film follows Frances, a middle aged married woman who is under the impression that her life is fine until her husband leaves her.  It was sudden and depressing yet she picks up (at the urging of her friends) and moves on, halfway around the world, to Italy.  She buys a villa, that needs a lot of work, and then sets off on an adventure of self-re-discovery as she chases what she thinks she needs and ultimately finds what has been eluding her all along.If you can get past the idea that this is yet `another one of those movies' you can see the magic in every frame.  Lane is a revelation, delivering a great performance that truly lifts the film to places it couldn't have gone without her.  The cinematography and mere sets alone are spellbinding (having just been to Tuscany I can say that it really is as magical as these films make it look) and the way that the story develops is also quite admirable because it doesn't exactly follow that generic formula (especially when concerning Frances's love interests).It is well worth a gander, especially if you are a fan of these types of chick-flicks.  It may be nearly ten years old (man, how the time flies) but it still holds up upon recent viewings and is the perfect film for a cozy night in with your significant other and a tall glass of wine.",4,Under the spell of Tuscany (and Diane Lane)...,1354147200,"11 29, 2012",2012,2005,"[""'m"", 'love', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'honestly', 'wish', 'career', 'post-Oscar', 'nomination', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'slightly', 'better', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'what', 'was', ""'m"", 'just', 'happy', 'still', 'working', 'really', 'bring', 'lot', 'what', 'year', 'following', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'turn', 'Unfaithful', 'where', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'cakewalk', 'put', 'out', 'one', 'standard', 'chick-flick', 'type', 'rom-coms', 'get', 'made', 'other', 'month', 'Basically', 'Eat', 'Pray', 'Love', '2000', 'just', 'far', 'less', 'muddled', 'unfocused', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'basic', 'predictable', 'yet', 'elevated', 'thanks', 'Lane', 'dedicated', 'performance', 'focus', 'brought', 'fleshing', 'out', 'depth', 'story.The', 'film', 'Frances', 'middle', 'aged', 'married', 'woman', 'who', 'impression', 'life', 'fine', 'husband', 'was', 'sudden', 'depressing', 'yet', 'up', 'urging', 'friends', 'moves', 'halfway', 'world', 'Italy', 'villa', 'lot', 'work', 'then', 'off', 'adventure', 'self-re-discovery', 'what', 'ultimately', 'what', 'been', 'eluding', 'can', 'get', 'idea', 'yet', 'one', 'movies', 'can', 'see', 'magic', 'frame', 'Lane', 'revelation', 'delivering', 'great', 'performance', 'truly', 'film', 'places', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'gone', 'cinematography', 'mere', 'sets', 'alone', 'are', 'spellbinding', 'having', 'just', 'been', 'Tuscany', 'can', 'say', 'really', 'as', 'magical', 'films', 'make', 'look', 'way', 'story', 'also', 'quite', 'admirable', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'follow', 'generic', 'formula', 'especially', 'when', 'concerning', 'Frances', 'love', 'interests', '.It', 'well', 'gander', 'especially', 'are', 'fan', 'types', 'chick-flicks', 'may', 'be', 'nearly', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'man', 'how', 'time', 'flies', 'still', 'up', 'upon', 'recent', 'viewings', 'perfect', 'film', 'cozy', 'night', 'significant', 'other', 'tall', 'glass', 'wine']",N/A

There are some complaints here on these review pages about this being a 'formulaic chick flick,' but it's subversively anything but.  Director Wells correctly points out in the 'Making Of' featurette that at the very moment in the chick flick formula where the love interest is supposed to appear (approx. 30 minutes in), we get a head fake...in fact, we get two of them & a true love interest appears only as an afterthought.  Instead, Wells keeps the focus on Lane's character's efforts to establish a household and fill it with love.  It's left to Raoul Bova (outstanding as Real Estate agent Marcello) to point out that Frances has done just that, right under her own nose.

It's so pretty to watch as well-- bright and full of color-- and that's not just because of the flowers and the stunning hillsides, the actors bring plenty of color to the film as well. Diane Lane is especially enjoyable in this one, playing a character we all knew she would be a perfect fit for, because let's face it, Diane Lane can do very little wrong.She plays Frances, a newly divorced writer who becomes so miserable in her life living in an apartment complex for divorcees that she decides to take her friend's offer to go on a romantic tour of Tuscany-- a gay romantic tour of Tuscany. Not that this matters at all in the film (because it really doesn't), but this is the reason she decides to leave in the first place because she'll have no chance that anyone will hit on her while she's ""Gay And Away.""Taking yet another chance, Frances buys an adorable little villa called Bramasole, which is just as picturesque as can be. Soon we get a plethora of interesting characters-- two ethnically mis-matched teens in love, a guy who never talks that can't stop shaking when he's around Frances, a goofy rotund contractor, a crazy blonde actress and more. This all equals a fun movie that no one should miss.Okay, so some cliches are employed here, but just think of how many movies do this.

786736,A3CKPNSGA7JOLK,B0000VD02Y,"Bachelier ""&#34;1004&#34;""","[5, 11]","Ghastly chick flic riddled with clich&eacute;s. Like Oscar Wilde's comment about Dickens, ""One would have to have a heart of stone to read the death of Little Nell without laughing."" The endless assault to the senses of repetitive themes of a woman scorned and a new life blossoming kept me between the Scylla and Charybdis of vomiting and hysterics. When we watched it, my wife repeatedly hit me over the head with her ""Elle"" magazine.Yet, this film has broad appeal for those middle aged men like me who've loved Diane Lane since ""A Little Romance,"" and like the outdoors and travel. The shots of Tuscany and the coast are beautiful, and the house around which most of the action takes place is gorgeous, and so of those chick flics for which we occasionally are obliged to sit through with our amante, this one is the least offensive.The first clich&eacute;: Frances Mayes (Diane Lane) has a perfect balanced life, with a wonderful happy home, all suddenly shattered by that snake-in-the-pants husband. Of course, the divorce settlement is all in *his* favor (""isn't that always the way, girl!?"").Next clich&eacute;: a gaggle of sympathetic but ultimately feckless friends with shadows of divided loyalties. Of course, the most sympathetic one is gay (you go, girlfriend!).I won't belabor the ""change of scene"" clich&eacute;, since, like ""The Simpson's"" Millhouse, by this time I wanted to scream ""when are we going to get to the fireworks factory?"" off to Tuscany: on a crummy bus!Next, an impulsive irrational decision (you go girl!) to buy a ruin of a house, not possibly made from a hormone imbalance or deeply unresolved issues without adequate coping mechanisms. No. This is feminine intuition at work. (Girl power!)In the town nearby, Frances meets Katherine (Lindsay Duncan), a `free spirited"" English woman (or mad lithium deprived manic depressive?) in her early 60s, who has erected her life as a cartoon of herself in devotion to an encounter in her youth with Fellini. It isn't tragic that she's done nothing with her life after building it on the shallow sands of glance with pseudo-intellectual ""greatness,"" it is s*i*g*n*i*f*i*c*a*n*t. Most of her dialogue consists of Katherine tediously lecturing Frances about sex, of which Frances improbably manages to get plenty of boy-toy supply, albeit short-lived (""snake in the pants men again! Boooo Hisssssss!""). One wonders why director Audrey Wells didn't cast the corpse of Ruth Gordon in this part. For the rest of the film I kept looking around for Bud Cort to drive up to the house in his hearse Jaguar to conclude the subplot by giving Katherine a good ""free spirited"" rogering and a happily ever after.Then there is the ironic cupid clich&eacute;: Frances's own love life (for which the house serves as metaphor) is being reconstructed from a ruin, yet she must play both Cupid and Hera to a younger couple. Yet the voice of Zelda comes in here too, ""Rich girls don't marry poor boys"" and Juliet is the daughter of forbidding Italian papa, and Romeo is a Polish blue collar dolt without family or purse.Did we keep getting beaten over the head with how important ""family"" is in the new place Frances has impulsively settled? We all know single-women without family end up mad (like Katherine). Angry, Juno (Frances) seeks a magic flower that is suppose to allow fertilization without a man (or embarks on a series of disastrous affairs). Finding the rare flower (her home, Bramasole) Juno (Frances) uses it to become pregnant and gives birth to Mars (additional subplot conflicts, including her own).And so, ""Family"" finally does resolves the plot, and Frances (Juno) hosts the wedding of our young lovers at her now restored home (Olympus).

786743,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B0000VD02Y,Bobby Underwood,"[1, 1]","This warm, beautiful, and often magical film from Audrey Wells would surely have been an Academy Award darling if made decades ago, as its tone and message, not to mention performances, fit more into the old-style filmmaking of a Hollywood now long gone. Diane Lane is simply marvelous as a woman whose world is turned upside down by divorce. In an attempt to start her life over and recapture the joy in life, she purchases a run down villa in Tuscany. Audrey Wells, who directed and co-produced the film with Tom Sternberg, also adapted Frances Mayes' book, giving this film the heavenly scent of grapes on the vine and the visual beauty of a field of sunflowers on an Italian hillside.Diane Lane is Frances, suddenly, and quite unexpectedly single again. Wondering how you breathe again when your world is shattered, Lane perfectly captures that stunned feeling of years wasted when a marriage ends. The wind is taken from the San Francisco writer's sails when someone half her age takes her place, which though cliche'd, is often the case. Sandra Oh of Grey's Anatomy fame lends fine support as Frances's friend, Patti, who refers to Frances's new place as 'camp divorce'. Adrift at sea emotionally, Frances has not moved forward despite having enough cash from the settlement to do so. When Patti experiences a similar heartbreak, she offers her friend the ticket to romantic Italy she can no longer use.Frances feels a change within herself, realizing if she truly is to recover from seeing her world crumble, she must build another one. After a chance meeting with Katherine (Lindsay Duncan), a free-spirited former Fellini actress, Frances jumps in with both feet, purchasing a run-down Italian villa called Bramasole. Vincent Liotta is excellent as the kind and decent realtor, Martini, who will become a true friend to Frances. There is an especially touching scene between the two as Frances realizes she has bought a house for which she doesn't have the life. The humorous elements of fixing up a 300 year old house on the hills of Tuscany are handled well by director Wells, adding great charm to a tender story, juxtaposing the ebb and flow of rebuilding a life and a villa. The happily married Martini has great affection for Frances nonetheless, aiding her by finding a group of Polish builders looking for work.The workers become part of her family as she refurbishes both her live and her villa. Pawel (Pawel Szajda), the youngest of the workers, falls in love Chira (Giulia Steigerwalt), the daughter of Frances's next door neighbor daughter, prompting Frances to intercede for her new family member with the girl's disapproving family. A simple white dress becomes a poignant image when Frances rediscovers the joy and excitement of new love with Marcello (Raol Bova), only to discover there is pain in learning to live again. That realization is soon confirmed when a devastated and quite pregnant Patti shows up on her doorstep in need of a shoulder. It is Frances's friend Martini who will come to her rescue again, however, opening her eyes to the fact that all her dreams have actually come true, if only she will use her heart to see them.This wonderful and life-affirming film ends at a wedding reception, proving that unthinkably good things can happen, even late in the game. The warmth and charm on display here is of another era, and was unfortunately scoffed at by many critics. Audrey Wells has made a sweet and ultimately joyful film about the living of life itself. A moist ocean breeze and the flavorful aroma of Italian food as it simmers seem to hang over every frame of celluloid used. Superlative photography from Geoffrey Simpson captures the many colors of Italy, the flag throwing festival where young Pawel tries to win over Chira's parents especially beautiful. Christophe Beck's score seems to fit every mood and situation without intruding upon the scene. Finally, Diane Lane gives a very gentle and old-style performance that fits the tone of this lovely film. Great and wonderful things occur even later in life, and often when we least expect them. That is the lovely message of this film.",5,A Sunflower to Life,1311465600,"07 24, 2011",2011,4139,"['warm', 'beautiful', 'often', 'magical', 'film', 'Audrey', 'Wells', 'would', 'surely', 'have', 'been', 'Academy', 'Award', 'darling', 'made', 'decades', 'ago', 'tone', 'message', 'not', 'mention', 'performances', 'fit', 'more', 'old-style', 'filmmaking', 'Hollywood', 'now', 'long', 'gone', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'simply', 'marvelous', 'woman', 'world', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'divorce', 'attempt', 'start', 'life', 'recapture', 'joy', 'life', 'purchases', 'run', 'down', 'villa', 'Tuscany', 'Audrey', 'Wells', 'who', 'directed', 'co-produced', 'film', 'Tom', 'Sternberg', 'also', 'adapted', 'Frances', 'Mayes', 'book', 'giving', 'film', 'heavenly', 'scent', 'grapes', 'vine', 'visual', 'beauty', 'field', 'sunflowers', 'Italian', 'hillside.Diane', 'Lane', 'Frances', 'suddenly', 'quite', 'unexpectedly', 'single', 'again', 'Wondering', 'how', 'breathe', 'again', 'when', 'world', 'shattered', 'Lane', 'perfectly', 'stunned', 'feeling', 'years', 'wasted', 'when', 'marriage', 'wind', 'taken', 'San', 'Francisco', 'writer', 'sails', 'when', 'someone', 'half', 'age', 'place', 'cliche', ""'d"", 'often', 'case', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'fame', 'fine', 'support', 'Frances', 'friend', 'Patti', 'who', 'Frances', 'new', 'place', ""'camp"", 'divorce', 'Adrift', 'sea', 'emotionally', 'Frances', 'not', 'moved', 'forward', 'having', 'enough', 'cash', 'settlement', 'do', 'so', 'When', 'Patti', 'similar', 'heartbreak', 'friend', 'ticket', 'romantic', 'Italy', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'feels', 'change', 'realizing', 'truly', 'recover', 'seeing', 'world', 'crumble', 'must', 'build', 'one', 'chance', 'meeting', 'Katherine', 'Lindsay', 'Duncan', 'free-spirited', 'former', 'Fellini', 'actress', 'Frances', 'feet', 'purchasing', 'run-down', 'Italian', 'villa', 'called', 'Bramasole', 'Vincent', 'Liotta', 'excellent', 'kind', 'decent', 'realtor', 'Martini', 'who', 'will', 'become', 'true', 'friend', 'Frances', 'especially', 'touching', 'scene', 'two', 'Frances', 'bought', 'house', ""n't"", 'have', 'life', 'humorous', 'elements', 'fixing', 'up', '300', 'year', 'old', 'house', 'hills', 'Tuscany', 'are', 'handled', 'well', 'director', 'Wells', 'adding', 'great', 'charm', 'tender', 'story', 'juxtaposing', 'ebb', 'flow', 'rebuilding', 'life', 'villa', 'happily', 'married', 'Martini', 'great', 'affection', 'Frances', 'nonetheless', 'aiding', 'finding', 'group', 'Polish', 'builders', 'looking', 'work.The', 'workers', 'become', 'part', 'family', 'live', 'villa', 'Pawel', 'Pawel', 'Szajda', 'youngest', 'workers', 'falls', 'love', 'Chira', 'Giulia', 'Steigerwalt', 'daughter', 'Frances', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'daughter', 'prompting', 'Frances', 'intercede', 'new', 'family', 'member', 'girl', 'disapproving', 'family', 'simple', 'white', 'dress', 'poignant', 'image', 'when', 'Frances', 'joy', 'excitement', 'new', 'love', 'Marcello', 'Raol', 'Bova', 'only', 'discover', 'pain', 'learning', 'live', 'again', 'realization', 'soon', 'confirmed', 'when', 'devastated', 'quite', 'pregnant', 'Patti', 'up', 'doorstep', 'need', 'shoulder', 'Frances', 'friend', 'Martini', 'who', 'will', 'come', 'rescue', 'again', 'however', 'opening', 'eyes', 'fact', 'dreams', 'have', 'actually', 'come', 'true', 'only', 'will', 'use', 'heart', 'see', 'them.This', 'wonderful', 'life-affirming', 'film', 'ends', 'wedding', 'reception', 'proving', 'unthinkably', 'good', 'things', 'can', 'happen', 'even', 'late', 'game', 'warmth', 'charm', 'display', 'here', 'era', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'scoffed', 'many', 'critics', 'Audrey', 'Wells', 'made', 'sweet', 'ultimately', 'joyful', 'film', 'living', 'life', 'moist', 'ocean', 'breeze', 'flavorful', 'aroma', 'Italian', 'food', 'seem', 'hang', 'frame', 'celluloid', 'used', 'Superlative', 'photography', 'Geoffrey', 'Simpson', 'many', 'colors', 'Italy', 'flag', 'throwing', 'festival', 'where', 'young', 'Pawel', 'win', 'over', 'Chira', 'parents', 'especially', 'beautiful', 'Christophe', 'Beck', 'score', 'fit', 'mood', 'situation', 'intruding', 'scene', 'Finally', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'very', 'gentle', 'old-style', 'performance', 'tone', 'lovely', 'film', 'Great', 'wonderful', 'things', 'occur', 'even', 'later', 'life', 'often', 'when', 'least', 'expect', 'lovely', 'message', 'film']",N/A
786744,A358XP3X4U0X45,B0000VD02Y,bookloversfriend,"[1, 4]","I bought this movie hoping to see some Tuscan scenery and because I like Diane Lane.There are few views of Italy and they are very brief.  In fact, the whole movie is a series of glimpses.  A birth scene lasting ten seconds.  A sketchy sex scene between two people who just met and don't show any signs of connecting. Glimpses of renovating the house.  There is no story as such.  The idea that she finds herself is totally unconvincing.The relationships are nil, except between the young boy and girl.  Frances and her Chinese friend are constantly telling each other how much they like each other and that they are best friends, but we never see any other interaction between them except that.  They have a half-dozen scenes at least and this is what they say every time!The reason God created stories was so that relationships could develop and become convincing.  By avoiding any continuous development and giving us a choppy, episodic smattering of this and that, this movie fails as travelogue, as love story, as friendship story, as personal development story.Contrast this movie with ""My House in Umbria"" to see what I mean.  The people in that movie connect with each other.  And they have character.  None of these people are characters, except the aging film star.  And the scenery is a presence in that movie, and is almost an actor in the movie in its effect on the people.I think the appeal of Under the Tuscan Sun is in its theme: You can do anything you want without forethought, let the chips fall where they may, and it will all work out fine.  This message is repeated explicitly several times throughout the film and is indeed illustrated repeatedly by the film itself.  You can even do nothing and next thing you know, you'll be crawling with ladybugs (a symbol of good luck).

786749,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0000VD02Y,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[4, 7]","Based on the book by Frances Mayes, Under The Tuscan Sun is a refreshing fish out of water romantic comedy. After taking a much needed vacation, a recently divorced writer buys a home in Tuscany on a whim, hoping the new home will jump start her journey to newfound happiness. Most likely to be categorized in the 'chick flick' realm, Under The Tuscan Sun follows the life of one woman as she interacts with friends, lovers, and new neighbors in an exotic and beautiful environment. The film portrays all the emotions - the ups and downs, the hopes and dreams - experienced by the main character as she takes on this monumental and spontaneous adventure. In short, Under The Tuscan Sun is an interesting, and oftentimes hilarious, film that tackles the constant travails of life in general...Thirty-something San Francisco writer Frances (Diane Lane) spirals into a deep depression when her ten-year marriage ends in divorce. To further complicate matters, she lives in a cramped apartment, and the stress of her divorce has left her with writer's block. Her good friend Patti (Sandra Oh), happily pregnant and involved in her own committed relationship, tries to cheer up Frances. But nothing seems to work - at least until a vacation is suggested.When Frances sets off on a tour of Italy, she unexpectedly gets off the bus and purchases a villa in Tuscany. Hundreds of years old and in disrepair, the home is in dire need of massive renovations. Frances devotes her new life to restoring the home, and she hires a ragtag band of immigrants and local people to help her. Meanwhile, she attempts to find love in her new country, but the harder she tries, the worse off things turn out. When Patti's lesbian lover leaves, she moves to Tuscany for the moral support offered by Frances. Now, Patti must give birth to a new life, and Frances must learn that the best rewards in life arrive when least expected...Sideways star Sandra Oh makes a name for herself playing the role of Patti, a good friend of Frances. Despite her appearance in a dozen plus films, Under The Tuscan Sun is the first time I can recall seeing Sandra Oh in a movie, and I can remember that she really made an impression. She has a distinctive onscreen presence, something unique that I can't quite identify, and perhaps this contributes in some small way to the current success she's experiencing.Meanwhile, Diane Lane creates a likeable and relatable character in Frances. Viewers will have no problem relating to divorcee's struggles within her personal life, and even the most pessimistic and dour of movie goers must give her credit for making such a bold move. As such, Under The Tuscan Sun manages to create one of those rare films which isn't so much plot-driven, nor focused on the personality of a monumental life. The film simply serves as a good night's entertainment (and a break, if one is needed, from the typical big money, high body count Hollywood productions). That's why Under The Tuscan Sun is a definite must-see film...The DVD Report",3,An entertaining story...,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,3026,"['Based', 'book', 'Frances', 'Mayes', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'refreshing', 'fish', 'water', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'taking', 'much', 'needed', 'vacation', 'recently', 'divorced', 'writer', 'home', 'Tuscany', 'whim', 'hoping', 'new', 'home', 'will', 'jump', 'start', 'journey', 'newfound', 'happiness', 'Most', 'likely', 'be', 'categorized', ""'chick"", 'flick', 'realm', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'life', 'one', 'woman', 'friends', 'lovers', 'new', 'neighbors', 'exotic', 'beautiful', 'environment', 'film', 'emotions', 'ups', 'downs', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'experienced', 'main', 'character', 'monumental', 'spontaneous', 'adventure', 'short', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'interesting', 'oftentimes', 'hilarious', 'film', 'constant', 'travails', 'life', 'general', 'Thirty-something', 'San', 'Francisco', 'writer', 'Frances', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'deep', 'depression', 'when', 'ten-year', 'marriage', 'divorce', 'further', 'complicate', 'matters', 'cramped', 'apartment', 'stress', 'divorce', 'left', 'writer', 'block', 'good', 'friend', 'Patti', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'happily', 'pregnant', 'involved', 'own', 'committed', 'relationship', 'tries', 'cheer', 'up', 'Frances', 'nothing', 'work', 'least', 'vacation', 'suggested.When', 'Frances', 'off', 'tour', 'Italy', 'unexpectedly', 'bus', 'purchases', 'villa', 'Tuscany', 'Hundreds', 'years', 'old', 'disrepair', 'home', 'dire', 'need', 'massive', 'renovations', 'Frances', 'new', 'life', 'restoring', 'home', 'ragtag', 'band', 'immigrants', 'local', 'people', 'help', 'Meanwhile', 'find', 'love', 'new', 'country', 'harder', 'worse', 'off', 'things', 'turn', 'out', 'When', 'Patti', 'lesbian', 'lover', 'leaves', 'Tuscany', 'moral', 'support', 'offered', 'Frances', 'Now', 'Patti', 'must', 'give', 'birth', 'new', 'life', 'Frances', 'must', 'learn', 'best', 'rewards', 'life', 'arrive', 'when', 'least', 'expected', 'Sideways', 'star', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'name', 'playing', 'role', 'Patti', 'good', 'friend', 'Frances', 'appearance', 'dozen', 'films', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'first', 'time', 'can', 'recall', 'seeing', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'movie', 'can', 'remember', 'really', 'made', 'impression', 'distinctive', 'onscreen', 'presence', 'something', 'unique', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'identify', 'perhaps', 'small', 'way', 'current', 'success', 'experiencing.Meanwhile', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'likeable', 'relatable', 'character', 'Frances', 'Viewers', 'will', 'have', 'problem', 'relating', 'divorcee', 'struggles', 'personal', 'life', 'even', 'most', 'pessimistic', 'dour', 'movie', 'goers', 'must', 'give', 'credit', 'making', 'such', 'bold', 'move', 'such', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'create', 'one', 'rare', 'films', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'plot-driven', 'focused', 'personality', 'monumental', 'life', 'film', 'simply', 'good', 'night', 'entertainment', 'break', 'one', 'needed', 'typical', 'big', 'money', 'high', 'body', 'count', 'Hollywood', 'productions', 'why', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'definite', 'must-see', 'film', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

He takes one look at her flowery, overwrought prose and throws it down in disgust, saying, ""Mom will never believe I wrote that!"" Like the words on that postcard, there are many cringe-worthy moments in this film.We get a homogenized, romanticized view of Tuscany, the way most middle-aged American women who feel unloved by their cloddy spouses might imagine it.  Stereotypes abound--there's the red-hot younger Italian lover (named Marcello, of course) whose broken English is supposed to be charming; the free-spirited, batty English woman (the fabulous Lindsay Duncan trapped inside a cliche) who takes joy in shocking the locals; the star-crossed young lovers; the elderly man still pining for his dead love; and the sassy yet approachable gay friend.Diane Lane is stunning as usual, but she mugs for the camera and hams it up a la Julia Roberts or Meg Ryan in too many instances, as if the audience might be too stupid to pick up on nuanced emotion.  She's played unhappy characters of this age before, and much more subtly and convincingly, in ""Unfaithful"" and ""A Walk on the Moon.""The views of Tuscany are gorgeous and motivation enough to make you want to drop everything and run off to Italy, even if the film itself is a forgettable, sometimes fun romp.",2,Nothing to write home about,1076457600,"02 11, 2004",2004,1471,"['Early', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'character', 'Frances', 'writer', 'dumped', 'husband', 'now', 'gay', 'tour', 'Tuscany', 'out', 'fellow', 'American', 'writing', 'postcard', 'send', 'mother', 'one', 'look', 'flowery', 'overwrought', 'prose', 'down', 'disgust', 'saying', 'Mom', 'will', 'never', 'believe', 'wrote', 'words', 'postcard', 'are', 'many', 'cringe-worthy', 'moments', 'film.We', 'get', 'homogenized', 'romanticized', 'view', 'Tuscany', 'way', 'most', 'middle-aged', 'American', 'women', 'who', 'feel', 'unloved', 'cloddy', 'spouses', 'might', 'imagine', 'Stereotypes', 'abound', 'red-hot', 'younger', 'Italian', 'lover', 'named', 'Marcello', 'course', 'broken', 'English', 'supposed', 'be', 'charming', 'free-spirited', 'batty', 'English', 'woman', 'fabulous', 'Lindsay', 'Duncan', 'trapped', 'cliche', 'who', 'joy', 'shocking', 'locals', 'star-crossed', 'young', 'lovers', 'elderly', 'man', 'still', 'pining', 'dead', 'love', 'sassy', 'yet', 'approachable', 'gay', 'friend.Diane', 'Lane', 'stunning', 'usual', 'camera', 'hams', 'up', 'la', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'too', 'many', 'instances', 'audience', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'stupid', 'pick', 'up', 'nuanced', 'emotion', 'played', 'unhappy', 'characters', 'age', 'much', 'more', 'subtly', 'convincingly', 'Unfaithful', 'Walk', 'Moon', 'views', 'Tuscany', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'motivation', 'enough', 'make', 'want', 'drop', 'everything', 'run', 'off', 'Italy', 'even', 'film', 'forgettable', 'sometimes', 'fun', 'romp']",N/A

What could go wrong?I'm a big Diane Lane fan, and I was really looking forward to watching this one, but it fell flat.  It's all about the story and how well it's written.  The story line itself had the potential to make a great movie.  It just wasn't written very well.  Even Diane couldn't rescue the lame dialogue, and usually her presence alone is good enough for me.  It was also completely implausible.  Frances tells her lawyer she has virtually no cash, her husband is requesting alimony, and apparently only receives her share of the equity from the sale of their house in the divorce settlement.  Somehow, though, she has enough money to travel to Europe, purchase a dilapidated, yet elegant country estate in Italy, support herself AND employ a 3 man crew for at least 9 months for the renovation.  C'mon.If you have a blu-ray player, your time won't be completely wasted by watching this because it really does have a ton of gorgeous scenery, including Diane.

""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is an insult to the international sisterhood of chick flick fans.The only way the filmmakers could have made this movie more stupid, more saccharine, more pandering to the lowest common denominator, is if they including a heartwarming, tearjerking, ""Terms of Endearment"" style death by beautiful movie disease.The Studly Hunk who falls into the Over-Forty Heroine's lap is just so ... airbrushed into unreality. How could anyone be turned on by a man who bears no relation to reality? Don't answer that. I don't want to know. Anyway, this is supposed to be a chick flick, not Sci Fi.The lead is a woman wounded by her ex-husband, lost chances, and the spectre of a wintry future. Diane Lane has a body a 20 year old would envy. She lacks gravitas. I couldn't feel for her plight. It's just not there on the ravaged face, the drooping body; she's too aerobicized and perky.""Tuscan Sun"" is as cluttered with gizmos girls are supposed to gush over as a Barbie doll house. There are swooning, adorable Polaks, goofy young lovers, a pregnant lesbian best friend.There are close-ups of yummy Italian food and unbelievably adorable people having big dinner parties. Everyone is adorable. Even grandma, with her internet love affair with a minor. It's so cute you really wish that at least one of the characters were serial killer.Everyone has tons of money and can fly between San Francisco to Italy without a moment's care. Frances, the lead character, lives a life completely divorced from normal monetary concerns. This sounds like a fantasy but it comes across as creepy. ""Does this woman ever work? Does money mean anything to her?"" These questions become so annoying, and distasteful, that you are taken out of the movie.For a movie that got similar themes very right, check out David Lean's 1955 ""Summertime,"" starring Katharine Hepburn and Rosano Brazzi. You love their onscreen romance, but you see that she is imperfect, and he is, too. ""Summertime"" is just as visually beautiful as ""Tuscan Sun,"" but it provides an artistic experience that ""Tuscan Sun"" can't even aspire to.I didn't much like this movie but I did like the actor playing Martini, the realtor who helped Diane Lane with so many things, including -- paging Dr. Freud -- a snake she could not find in her bedroom.There was a real chemistry between the two. He wasn't the most handsome man in the movie, or the most sexually dynamic, but he was the one, I think, that most viewers probably wanted to see her end up with.He was married. But this is a movie. You have two characters with such great chemistry; you could make his wife a harridan, or a lesbian -- not enough Italian lesbian movie characters out there -- or maybe she received a vocation from God and entered a convent.

786777,A103KNDW8GN92L,B0000VD02Y,David Hugaert,"[1, 1]","Welcome to Tuscany - a region of Italy known for its breathtaking old-world scenery, charming people, and the plumpest grapes, which are used to produce the finest bouquet of wines this side of Napa Valley. This is also the place where a recently divorced, down on her luck writer, Frances (Diane Lane) retreats (at the request of friends) to begin a life anew, free from her recent setback...or so Frances thought. Our young writer's problems really begin to take shape as soon as she purchases a 300 year old house, located on the edge of a fairly modest village in the Tuscan countryside. Once settled in, Frances finds that she gets more than she bargained for, including a relationship with a suave, handsome Italian corner store owner (Raoul Bova). Frances' relationship with this attracive young individual is one of the most touching moments of ""Under The Tuscan Sun"". Sandra Oh gives a rather dramatic performance as Frances' best friend, who, is as surprised and as shocked as anyone, when she learns of Frances' decision that she has bought an old, broken down slum of a dilapidated heap of a house, therefore wondering if Frances' brain was on autopilot when making such a spur-of-the-moment decision! Ah, but as is sometimes the case, there is indeed a silver lining tucked beneath this ominously dark cloud, for our temporarliy displaced writer does not travel this journey alone. Also along on this Tuscan sojourn, are a family of Polish immigrants (who work cheaply and dilgently in struggling to get the house in order), as well as a worldly English woman (who, like Eric Idle's character in ""National Lampoon's European Vacation"", pops up unexpectedly). There are also other living things on this journey as well - in the form of arachnids and slimey reptiles. Blecch! With so much taking place in its two hours of undisputed mayhem and glory, ""Under The Tuscan Sun"" combines the melodrama of a soap opera, with the wit and wisdom of an intellectual novel (upon which this picture is based). You'll need a handkerchief handy while sitting through some of this film's most touching moments. Like Tuscany's many winding pathways contained in many of its villages, there's always a maze of adventure and excitement just waiting ""under the sun"".

Frances, suffering from the depression of a failed marriage, is urged by her pregnant friend Patti (Sandra Oh) to take her place on a tour of Italy.  While at first reluctant, Frances finally accepts Patti's offer when the reality of her life in New York becomes too painful.  Frances is almost immediately charmed by life in Tuscany and on impulse buys a run-down villa that she plans to restore into her personal haven.  Frances, now reborn as Francesca, is hardly alone in her new country as she is befriended by her real estate agent, the mysterious over-the-top blonde woman, her crew of Polish workers, and other townspeople.  But sadness still tugs at her.  Only when events turn out not as she expected does she begin to accept life on its terms and not on her own.The script and direction (by Audrey Wells) give this film the pacing of an art film, where the subtle interactions and plot cannot be described as much as sensed; however, the feel-good ending has the tacked on feel of a romantic comedy, where the heroine gets what she wants, even though the comedy itself is more smile- than laugh-inducing.  To the credit of the screenwriters, events don't unfold exactly the way one would expect. For instance, the old man who delivers flowers every day to a roadside shrine is never explained despite his emotional connection to Frances.  The man one would think could bring Frances her much needed romance does not.  And the birth of Patti's child does not make Frances feel included at all.  The turns are small, quiet ones, but they provide enough conflict to keep the viewer engaged.  The cinematography fails to exploit the setting, resulting in a more conventional look than one would expect.Despite its flaws, this is a sweet, low-key film.  While ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" may appeal to more women than men, it does not have the syrupy romance and teary-eyed moments of most films categorized as ""chick flicks.""

786783,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0000VD02Y,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 4]","American author Frances Mayes, was best known for published poetry work and also being the Professor of Creative Writing, director of the Poetry Center and chair of the Department of Creative Writing at San Francisco University.But in 1996, Frances would release her memoir, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"", based on her experience of purchasing an abandoned villa in rural Cortona in Tuscany, Italy.  The memoir was a success and was number one on the New York Times Best Sellers list for over two years.The memoir would eventually receive a film adaptation in 2003 courtesy of filmmaker/writer Audrey Wells (""George of the Jungle"", ""Shall We Dance?"", ""The Game Plan"").  And the film would star actress Diane Lane (""The Perfect Storm"", ""Unfaithful"", ""Jumper""), Sandra Oh (""Grey's Anatomy"", ""Sideways"", ""Hard Candy""), Lindsay Duncan (""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"") and Vincent Riotta (""The Dark Knight"", ""Revolver"", ""Heaven""), plus a cameo from one of Italian's legendary filmmakers Mario Monicelli.Having been released on DVD back in 2003, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" was released on Blu-ray in July 2012.VIDEO:""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  A major positive about ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is the location of where the film is shot in Italy is absolutely beautiful.  Cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson  (""Fried Green Tomatoes"", ""Little Women"", ""Shine"") did a wonderful job of capturing the beauty of Italy through this film.  Colors are vibrant during the outdoor scenes, closeups feature detail on the faces of the talent, black levels are nice and deep and much better clarity of this film on Blu-ray vs. its DVD counterpart.I detected no artifacts, banding or any problems while viewing this film.  If anything, fans of ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" will enjoy the HD transfer of this film.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French 5.1 and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital.  For a romantic comedy, dialogue is crystal clear and while there is some music, the film is primarily dialogue driven coming through the front and center channels.  But the surround channels are used.  Quite effectively during the storm sequence and also for ambiance, especially during scenes with a larger crowd.  Overall, the lossless soundtrack for ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" was good and quite appropriate for a romantic comedy.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""Under the Tuscan Sun"" comes with the following special features:Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary with director Audrey Wells.  Wells talks about the film adaptation of ""Under the Tuscan Sun"", working with the talent and crew, shooting in various locations in Italy plus the costume and set design.Tuscany 101 Making of Featurette - (9:26) Featuring interviews with filmmaker Audrey Wells, author Frances Mayes and the cast regarding the ""Under the Tuscan Sun"".Deleted Scenes - (2:31) Featuring three deleted scenes.JUDGMENT CALL:For any adult who has been married and then finding themselves divorced, especially after their 40&#8242;s, it's a frightening experience.It's one thing to start over from scratch, when you are younger but when you are older, you just never know what is out there, whether you still have what it takes to get into a new relationship but mostly the fear of starting over.What I enjoyed about ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is the fact that it's based on the real-life memoir of Frances Mayes and that Diane Keaton would play the character with efficacy.A romantic comedy shot in a beautiful location, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is a movie that many divorcees can relate to (ore those who have ended a long relationship with their partner), because these are issues that many people face.  The difference is that not many people get the opportunity to escape to Italy or another country.So, watching the film, you can't help but laugh and be delighted by the character of Frances Mayes, as she tries to find her way in Italy.  Yes, she is aware about Italian men (and we see many scenes with Italian men trying to get her attention), especially the number of Italian men who are attracted to Frances, but yet are married.  It's a different culture than America but it's quite fascinating to see it all happen in Italy and see how the character of Frances manages to learn about herself through the people she meets and dates.But there is no doubt that the film is quite irresistible due to its location.  From the beautiful buildings to the local merchants, to seeing Katherine (Lindsay Duncan) being a bit La Dolce Vitta or to see Frances Mayes learning to cook Italian food and preparing it for her Polish workers.  Suffice to say, it's a fun film with plenty of enjoyable supporting actors.""Grey's Anatomy"" actress Sandra Oh stars alongside then fellow ""Grey's Anatomy"" co-star Kate Walsh as a lesbian couple expecting a baby.  Pawel Szajda as Pawel, the Polish immigrant who has fallen for the Italian Chiara (as portrayed by Giulia Steigerwalt).  Two y0ung people who have fallen in love but whether or not her parents would support their relationship because he is Polish (and has no major job).The acting performance was well-done but Diane Lane absolutely shined in this film and was delightful to watch in this film!As for the Blu-ray release, the video quality is an upgrade over the DVD release.  Lossless audio definitely sounds great via the surround channels, may it be the storm sequence or crowd ambiance, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" looks and sounds great via HD.  As for special features, it's pretty much the same special features on the original DVD - audio commentary, deleted Scenes and a short making-of featurette.But overall, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" was a fun romantic comedy.  Granted, there is no major male co-star to go along with Diane Lane, but that's perfectly fine.  This whole film is about a divorcee starting over with her life and learning more about herself and the fact that the world is not going to end.  And no matter how scary life can be at this new chapter in a divorcee's life, you move forward and keep living your life.If you are a fan of this 2003 film or just wanting a beautiful, delightful romantic comedy on Blu-ray that is not so much focused on a relationship but more about one woman coming off a long relationship and starting over in a foreign country, then definitely give ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" a try!",4,"(3.5 Stars) Blu-ray:  For those looking for a beautiful, delightful romantic comedy on Blu-ray",1354147200,"11 29, 2012",2012,6466,"['American', 'author', 'Frances',

After the divorce Frances goes to Tuscany on a lark, falls in love with a villa there, buys it and proceeds to renovate it. The villa then is the physical manifestation of the shedding of her old life and marriage and the hope for the renovation and rehabilitation of her love life as well as her life in general.That she probably places too much faith in the physical to solve the emotional does not detract at all from the guts and hope that it takes to do so. And Lane is so psychically centered and open as Frances that you cannot help but be moved by her situation.There are some silly plot lines and performances that I wish weren't, but with a central performance as attractive and genuinely loving and feminine as Lane's, &quot;Under The Tuscan Sun&quot; is as warm and inviting as bread just out of the oven. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title",5,Loved and Beloved by All,1081728000,"04 12, 2004",2004,1482,"['What', 'out', 'Italian', 'quot', 'Money', 'Pit', 'quot', 'attendant', 'broken', 'pipes', 'crumbling', 'walls', 'incompetent', 'handymen', 'turn', 'better', 'third', 'way', 'more', 'emotionally', 'centered', 'revealing', 'movie', 'quot', 'Tuscan', 'Sun.', 'quot', 'luminescent', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'stars', 'Frances', 'intelligent', 'loving', 'women', 'close', 'committed', 'friends', 'who', 'situation', 'many', 'people', 'do', 'mate', 'who', 'fallen', 'love', 'divorce', 'as', 'well', 'possession', 'much', 'loved', 'painstakingly', 'renovated', 'house', 'one', 'San', 'Francisco', 'divorce', 'Frances', 'Tuscany', 'lark', 'love', 'villa', 'there', 'proceeds', 'renovate', 'villa', 'then', 'physical', 'manifestation', 'shedding', 'old', 'life', 'marriage', 'hope', 'renovation', 'rehabilitation', 'love', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'life', 'general.That', 'probably', 'too', 'much', 'faith', 'physical', 'solve', 'emotional', 'not', 'detract', 'guts', 'hope', 'do', 'so', 'Lane', 'so', 'psychically', 'centered', 'open', 'Frances', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'moved', 'situation.There', 'are', 'silly', 'plot', 'lines', 'performances', 'wish', 'were', ""n't"", 'central', 'performance', 'attractive', 'genuinely', 'loving', 'feminine', 'Lane', 'quot', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'quot', 'warm', 'inviting', 'bread', 'just', 'oven', 'text', 'out', 'print', 'unavailable', 'edition', 'title']",N/A

Diane Lane's performance, in my opinion, was one of the best I've seen in a film this year. It's rare for me to enjoy a movie, especially one that is, in places, narrated but it was truly a great movie to watch. It takes place in Italy and as I recall most of the production crew was Italian, which I thought was a very good idea for who knows Italy better than the people who live there? The cast was an interesting array of talented men and women. I especially liked Sandra Oh as Patti and Lindsay Duncan as Katherine. The script was my favourite part of the entire film although the setting was beautiful and the cast well chosen.

Von Behren ""reneofc""","[5, 6]","San Francisco based writer, college professor and book critic, Frances Mayes, hits the emotional skids when she is informed of her husband's extramarital affair and finds herself immersed in a divorce that lands her in a dismal hotel complex inhabited by sad and scarred victims of separation.  Even though she is caught in the tailspin of her own disappointment, she accepts the gift of a trip to Tuscany from friends and embarks on a journey that will gradually fuel her life with optimism.  On impulse, she purchases a ramshackle farmhouse in the countryside near Cortena and sets upon the seemingly impossible task of its renovation while simultaneously reinventing her own sensibilities and her lifestyle in general.  As she toils under the Tuscan sun as an outsider to the town and its people, she finds herself becoming one of them, seeing each of the lives she encounters as an individual quest for La Dolce Vita so poignantly captured in Fellini's film and echoed by the aging Anita Ekberg wannabe who attempts to and advises Frances to retain a childlike innocence and exuberance when viewing any situation in the big bad world.With a lead like Diane Lane playing Frances, there must. of course, be a man, in this case a delicious hunk of Italian that cavalierly convinces Frances and the cameras to follow him from the ochre magnificence of Rome to the tiered splendor of the Amalfi coast.  These sequences explode with so much visual pleasure the viewer sighs, involuntarily blinded by the sensual overload of color and sound and as expected, glimpses of both Lane and her lover as they frolic to the tune of the campanile's bells.For those who have read the book of the same name, there is no comparison.  These are completely different stories.  If you are expecting the idyllic sweetness of the book with its anecdotes of Italian life, forget it.  The movie-Frances dwells on her divorce which springboards her into asking some of life's big questions, while the book-Frances has already worked all this out prior to writing the first page and immerses herself in the simple lovely indulgence of following the course of a sweet life of which she has already mapped out.  The ""Ed"" that Frances finds at the end of the film, is with the book-Frances from the very start; in fact, they renovate the house together, content from the outset.I entered the theatre expecting this film to be mediocre based on the ubiquitous trailers seen on television which try far too hard to make the film seem cutsy rather than stimulating.  My advise is to watch none of these sugary confections which take words of dialogue out of context to appeal to a certain audience; if you like all things Italian and are indeed, searching for a dolce vita of your own, go see the film.  Disregard the obvious contrivances in the plot and prepare yourself to fall in love with the lush scenery that gently lulls that annoying sense of American expediency out of existence, for at least the two hour viewing time.  Above all, view the film with the childlike pleasure of the Italians for whom every experience is a new one to be savored. Then go out and buy a copy of the book La Dolce Vita offered on Amazon.com to begin your own quest for the sweet life.",4,Finding La Dolce Vita--a Must See for Italophiles,1063670400,"09 16, 2003",2003,3241,"['San', 'Francisco', 'based', 'writer', 'college', 'professor', 'book', 'critic', 'Frances', 'Mayes', 'emotional', 'skids', 'when', 'informed', 'husband', 'extramarital', 'affair', 'immersed', 'divorce', 'dismal', 'hotel', 'complex', 'inhabited', 'sad', 'scarred', 'victims', 'separation', 'Even', 'caught', 'tailspin', 'own', 'disappointment', 'gift', 'trip', 'Tuscany', 'friends', 'embarks', 'journey', 'will', 'gradually', 'fuel', 'life', 'optimism', 'impulse', 'purchases', 'ramshackle', 'farmhouse', 'countryside', 'Cortena', 'sets', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'task', 'renovation', 'simultaneously', 'reinventing', 'own', 'sensibilities', 'lifestyle', 'general', 'Tuscan', 'sun', 'outsider', 'town', 'people', 'becoming', 'one', 'seeing', 'lives', 'individual', 'quest', 'La', 'Dolce', 'Vita', 'so', 'poignantly', 'captured', 'Fellini', 'film', 'echoed', 'aging', 'Anita', 'Ekberg', 'wannabe', 'who', 'advises', 'Frances', 'retain', 'childlike', 'innocence', 'exuberance', 'when', 'viewing', 'situation', 'big', 'bad', 'world.With', 'lead', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'playing', 'Frances', 'must', 'course', 'be', 'man', 'case', 'delicious', 'hunk', 'Italian', 'cavalierly', 'convinces', 'Frances', 'cameras', 'follow', 'ochre', 'magnificence', 'Rome', 'tiered', 'splendor', 'Amalfi', 'coast', 'sequences', 'explode', 'so', 'much', 'visual', 'pleasure', 'viewer', 'sighs', 'involuntarily', 'blinded', 'sensual', 'overload', 'color', 'sound', 'expected', 'glimpses', 'Lane', 'lover', 'frolic', 'tune', 'campanile', 'bells.For', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'comparison', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'stories', 'are', 'expecting', 'idyllic', 'sweetness', 'book', 'anecdotes', 'Italian', 'life', 'forget', 'movie-Frances', 'dwells', 'divorce', 'asking', 'life', 'big', 'questions', 'book-Frances', 'already', 'worked', 'out', 'prior', 'writing', 'first', 'page', 'simple', 'lovely', 'indulgence', 'following', 'course', 'sweet', 'life', 'already', 'mapped', 'out', 'Ed', 'end', 'film', 'book-Frances', 'very', 'start', 'fact', 'renovate', 'house', 'together', 'content', 'outset.I', 'entered', 'theatre', 'expecting', 'film', 'be', 'mediocre', 'based', 'ubiquitous', 'trailers', 'seen', 'television', 'try', 'far', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'film', 'seem', 'cutsy', 'rather', 'stimulating', 'advise', 'watch', 'none', 'sugary', 'confections', 'take', 'words', 'dialogue', 'context', 'appeal', 'certain', 'audience', 'like', 'things', 'Italian', 'are', 'indeed', 'searching', 'dolce', 'vita', 'own', 'go', 'see', 'film', 'Disregard', 'obvious', 'contrivances', 'plot', 'prepare', 'fall', 'love', 'lush', 'scenery', 'gently', 'annoying', 'sense', 'American', 'expediency', 'existence', 'least', 'two', 'hour', 'viewing', 'time', 'view', 'film', 'childlike', 'pleasure', 'Italians', 'whom', 'experience', 'new', 'one', 'be', 'savored', 'Then', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'copy', 'book', 'La', 'Dolce', 'Vita', 'offered', 'Amazon.com', 'begin', 'own', 'quest', 'sweet', 'life']",N/A

For a start, the portrayal of the people is very well done, although it certainly shows Italians mostly on their best behaviour, but still very accurate.  They are generally helpful, friendly and quick to accept Americans and other foreigners especially if the ""stranieri"" appear to sincerely appreciate a different lifestyle and don't focus entirely on the inefficiencies and shortcomings that go along with it.  The scene in the notary's office is a very good example.  The deal is done in a competent way but with a good dose of humanity.  The people in the street scenes are as authentic as can be, they are Cortona residents and, unsurprisingly, speak with the local accent.  The building crew are Polish and that explains their accents.I was amazed to find so much venom directed at the Marcello character.  His behaviour became perfectly understandable if one grasped the fact that months had elapsed between their initial meeting and the later one.  The parade of potential builders is obviously meant to be a comic caricature of personalities, but it really doesn't stray too far from the truth.  I have met people just like them.  In fact, all the characters in the movie are fairly believable, the single exception being Ed, who (even considering his limited role) is completely wooden and exhibits the personality of the proverbial door-knob.I detest the term ""chick flick"" and this film does not deserve it.  I think the story was handled with such a soft, restrained hand that it was misinterpreted as being lightweight, when in fact it dealt undramatically with many human dramas.  Not everything has to be guts and gore to be heart-felt.  I thought Diane Lane gave a perfectly nuanced performance, her character suffered a great deal and yet she tried to handle the collapse of her marriage and ultimately her entire life in a dignified and adult way.  Any sensitive person would feel her distress, no histrionics needed.  The many supporting actors also gave warm, masterfully well-judged performances;  particularly good, in my opinion, were Vincent Riotta, Lindsay Duncan and Pawel Szajda.The single failing of the film might be that grasping a random opportunity and rebuilding a happy life out of the ruins of your previous one is too often a dream that does not come true, but I will never complain about an optimistic and uplifting viewpoint.  It certainly beats the current fixation with wallowing in the ugliest and vilest possible view of mankind which so-called ""serious"" film makers try to pass off as gritty realism.The photography is of the highest level, the Tuscan countryside and Positano coastline appear in all their glory (even off-season) and Audrey Wells did a great job of the screenplay and direction, despite the obvious technical challenges of adapting a book to the wide screen and, apparently, a tight budget.  And finally, contrary to another common complaint, my OH and I both enjoy watching this beautiful production and do so at regular intervals whenever we need a bit of cheering up and a virtual visit to the Tuscany we know and love.",5,The ultimate warm-glow movie,1347148800,"09 9, 2012",2012,3432,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'reviews', 'already', '2003', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'more', 'was', 'necessary', 'however', 'have', 'read', 'so', 'much', 'unjust', 'criticism', 'film', 'regard', 'stereotypes', 'Italian', 'characters', 'thought', 'perhaps', 'few', 'home', 'facts', 'Italian', 'native', 'might', 'be', 'order', 'will', 'try', 'hardest', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'start', 'portrayal', 'people', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'certainly', 'Italians', 'mostly', 'best', 'behaviour', 'still', 'very', 'accurate', 'are', 'generally', 'helpful', 'friendly', 'quick', 'accept', 'Americans', 'other', 'foreigners', 'especially', 'stranieri', 'appear', 'sincerely', 'appreciate', 'different', 'lifestyle', 'do', ""n't"", 'focus', 'entirely', 'inefficiencies', 'shortcomings', 'go', 'along', 'scene', 'notary', 'office', 'very', 'good', 'example', 'deal', 'done', 'competent', 'way', 'good', 'dose', 'humanity', 'people', 'street', 'scenes', 'are', 'as', 'authentic', 'can', 'be', 'are', 'Cortona', 'residents', 'unsurprisingly', 'speak', 'local', 'accent', 'building', 'crew', 'are', 'Polish', 'accents.I', 'was', 'amazed', 'find', 'so', 'much', 'venom', 'directed', 'Marcello', 'character', 'behaviour', 'became', 'perfectly', 'understandable', 'one', 'grasped', 'fact', 'months', 'had', 'elapsed', 'initial', 'meeting', 'later', 'one', 'parade', 'potential', 'builders', 'obviously', 'meant', 'be', 'comic', 'caricature', 'personalities', 'really', ""n't"", 'stray', 'too', 'far', 'truth', 'have', 'met', 'people', 'just', 'fact', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'fairly', 'believable', 'single', 'exception', 'being', 'Ed', 'who', 'even', 'considering', 'limited', 'role', 'completely', 'wooden', 'personality', 'proverbial', 'door-knob.I', 'detest', 'term', 'chick', 'flick', 'film', 'not', 'deserve', 'think', 'story', 'was', 'handled', 'soft', 'restrained', 'hand', 'was', 'misinterpreted', 'being', 'lightweight', 'when', 'fact', 'dealt', 'undramatically', 'many', 'human', 'dramas', 'Not', 'everything', 'be', 'guts', 'gore', 'be', 'heart-felt', 'thought', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'gave', 'perfectly', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'character', 'suffered', 'great', 'deal', 'yet', 'tried', 'handle', 'collapse', 'marriage', 'ultimately', 'entire', 'life', 'dignified', 'adult', 'way', 'sensitive', 'person', 'would', 'feel', 'distress', 'histrionics', 'needed', 'many', 'supporting', 'actors', 'also', 'gave', 'warm', 'masterfully', 'well-judged', 'performances', 'particularly', 'good', 'opinion', 'were', 'Vincent', 'Riotta', 'Lindsay', 'Duncan', 'Pawel', 'Szajda.The', 'single', 'failing', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'grasping', 'random', 'opportunity', 'rebuilding', 'happy', 'life', 'ruins', 'previous', 'one', 'too', 'often', 'dream', 'not', 'come', 'true', 'will', 'never', 'complain', 'optimistic', 'uplifting', 'viewpoint', 'certainly', 'current', 'fixation', 'wallowing', 'ugliest', 'vilest', 'possible', 'view', 'mankind', 'so-called', 'serious', 'film', 'makers', 'try', 'pass', 'off', 'gritty', 'realism.The', 'photography', 'highest', 'level', 'Tuscan', 'countryside', 'Positano', 'coastline', 'appear', 'glory', 'even', 'off-season', 'Audrey', 'Wells', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'obvious', 'technical', 'challenges', 'adapting', 'book', 'wide', 'screen', 'apparently', 'tight', 'budget', 'finally', 'contrary', 'common', 'complaint', 'OH', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'beautiful', 'production', 'do', 'so', 'regular', 'intervals', 'whenever', 'need', 'bit', 'cheering', 'up', 'virtual', 'visit', 'Tuscany', 'know', 'love']",N/A

I mean...Diane Lane, the breath-taking Tuscany countryside and a gorgeous, though extremely run down, villa. Whats not to like? Unfortunately plenty.Don't misunderstand me though. The idea of watching Diane Lane for two hours is something that, for the most part, I find enjoyable, if not entertaining as well but... For the most part stooping to the usual Hollywood cliche's by making our heroine a perennial victim ( cheating hubby AND uncaring lover! ) is not only transparent and terribly obvious but almost patronizing as well. Why is it that Hollywood feels the need to make women total victims of lousy husbands/boyfriends in a pathological desire to cast the films star as innocent and therefore extremely likable? And sadly that's just the beginning of the film that I had originally thought was to be a humorous yet sensitive movie concerning a womans growth and bid for independence. But it was not to be. Cliche's abound and during my initial viewing I almost cringed at dialogue that was less then sterling and a story line that was almost little more then a 'Lifetime Channel for Women' movie of the week.After our heroine decides to purchase the 'fixer-upper' of her dreams she moves in and with all of the subtlty of a Lucille Ball/Desi Arnez sit-com finds herself in one silly situation after another. Most of those being so contrived and obvious that I could almost tell what might happen next. You know...language problems, getting hired handy men to do their jobs, nosy neighbors, blah, blah, blah. No doubt you get the idea. All the while Ms. Lane makes friends with some of those wacky locals ( why are locals in these types of films always silly and full of character? ). Sadly, the cliche's truly never stop. And if it wasn't for the truly beautiful setting and stunning landscapes I probably would have given up but that may be this films only saving grace.Nevertheless, of course Ms. Lane meets a gentleman who she seems smitten with and with all of the emotional maturity of an over-sexed sixteen year she old falls in love with the Italian Stallion. Though once again to be done wrong by the cad who doesn't exactly return those very same amorous feelings. Rats! Poor Diane. Just another rotten guy that has no true feelings! Also, why do people in movies such as this fall in love with all the ease of changing one's clothes? Anyway, its all so painfully obvious and juvenile I almost used the DVD as a frisbee to relieve the rotten mood that this movie had put me in. Sorry to all fans of this movie but God knows the victim mentality that permeates this film is not only over-bearing but pandering as well. I guess I was supposed to be wringing my hands all the while thinking, "" Poor, poor Diane. ""Well, of course at the very end of this...whatever you may call this umm thing, our heroine meets yet devastatingly attractive bachelor. Seems as though in this movie their falling out of the trees! Yes, all wells that ends well and perhaps Diane has found true love after all. You would have thought by this time that Ms. Lane would have learned her lesson but in true Hollywood fashion love conquers all and I suppose that the directors wanted the audience to cross their little fingers and hope that she has found that one true knight in shining armour. Thereby assuring our heroine that she will live happily ever after since in the movies no woman is ever really happy unless she has found her life-time mate. Again, sorry but the nauseating factor at this point was well past the point of anything redeeming this schlock that must cater to women who still believe in soul-mates, puppy-love and Cinderella endings.

Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[8, 10]","Thousands of years ago, long before the Romans came on the scene, Italy was under the hegemony of a people known as the Etruscans.  Eventually they were conquered by the Romans and were absorbed into the Roman Empire.  Today, there is but one place in Rome which gives a hint to their existence:  Tuscany.Today, we have the pleasure of having none other than Diane Lane as our tour guide of the verdant countryside of Tuscany.  Ms. Lane potrays a woman who is recovering from a devastating divorce.  While on an Italian tour she impulsively buys a run-down Italian villa that is out in the country.  The story depicts the interesting parallel of her attempts to fix up the house as symbolic of her efforts to put her life back together after having to endure the emotional wrecking ball of a nasty, mean-spirited divorce.If I were to describe Diane Lane in one word, it would be likeable.  Yes, she is gorgeous and she has a smokin' hot body.  However, just one word would be likeable.  She is the type of person we'd all relish to have as our next-door neighbor - for reasons that extend WELL beyond her physical appearance.  She is likeable even when she plays characters that are not-so-likeable, as she did in the movie UNFAITHFUL.Some would categorize this movie as a Romantic Comedy.  I'm not so sure I would.  Yes, there are some comical scenes in it, but I would lean a little more towards calling it a drama due to the depth of character development.In summary, I would basically recommend this movie to 3 demographics of persons:  Italians, non-Italians and everyone else.

The movie is just a good chance to make a trip to Italy while seated in front of your television and DVD set. In fact, this trip provides to the viewer good locations (especially the ones taken at the city of Positano, in South Italy), a brief look at the habits and style of life in this otherwise fascinating Mediterranean country. But that's all.The movie is just another bittersweet story of love, friendship and delusions without anything new to be taken or even a minimal original approach to such pondering themes. Many viewers will certainly find this movie amusing and lighthearted - and this is a correct mode to describe this one - but it's shallow characters and routine treatment made the final outcome just a passable but unnoticed experience.

786801,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0000VD02Y,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 8]","It's good to see Diane Lane enjoy a career renaissance after such a promising start nearly a quarter-century ago in George Roy Hill's ""A Little Romance"", as a prepubescent American falling in love with a Parisian boy, who whisks her away to Venice under the knowing eye of Laurence Olivier. Ironically, in this most recent movie, she plays an American woman, again in Italy, but this time escaping a broken marriage to find fulfillment in a Tuscan villa she decides to buy on the spot and renovate. Leave it to Lane to make it all look reasonable as what was precocious in the earlier movie has matured into a lovely sense of self-awareness and gravity in this film. And her beauty has become even more striking over the years. She has also become accomplished in displaying several emotions concurrently, layering her characters with a complexity of feelings so that you can never quite predict what she is thinking and what she will do next. Her post-coital train ride in Adrian Lyne's ""Unfaithful"" is a great example of this hard-earned skill. And Lane needs this skill in spades as she plays a fictionalized version of Frances Mayes, the author of the book upon which this greatly altered movie is based. The character seems to be longing for something she never quite figures out, and the actress convincingly portrays this sense of want. In fact, Lane almost saves this movie but not quite.At heart, this is a patronizing romantic fantasy that feels like it was produced in another era entirely, somewhere in the mid-fifties when Lane's character would be labeled a brazen, put-upon woman tainted by divorce. I kept expecting Rosanno Brazzi to come out and say something ridiculously continental to sweep her off her feet. Instead, we get Raoul Bava, who delivers the smoldering good looks but none of the irony of his rather trite Italian lover role. Lending even more color to the soap opera atmosphere is a gallery of eccentrics with an array of international accents who serve up allegorical fables and Hallmark-card advice to the heroine - an empathetic real estate agent who seems to have a crush on Frances (a flirtation I wish the director could have explored more); the young lovers who must deal predictably with the disapproval of the girl's strict parents; the rest of the inept but dedicated renovation crew; the English free-spirit who worked with Fellini and seems to have kept up her ""la dolce vita"" character in real life; the pregnant lesbian friend abandoned by her lover. Intentionally or not, Frances seems to help set all their lives on the right path, as the picturesquely run-down old villa gradually turns into the home of her dreams and serves as a life-affirming metaphor. So many contrivances riddle the story, especially toward the end when plot threads get tied up quickly. Frances' fate is not all that satisfying to the viewer either, and you know your plot is undercooked when a minor character is introduced in the last few minutes to provide romantic salvation. In truth, I am not sure how much better this movie could have been given the base material, as the story is nothing deeper than the Harlequin romance novels you find in the checkout line at Safeway. It just seems like there are lots of personal problems floating around the plot, but I have to give credit to Lane and director Audrey Wells who jointly make the film anything but sad.  Add to that the travelogue aspect with the lovely cinematography by Geoffrey Simpson of Italy's beautiful landscapes, and you can think of worse ways to spend two hours. And watch it for the true coming-of-age of Diane Lane, radiant, gifted and far more deserving of material better than this.",3,"Luminous Lane, Beautiful Scenery...But Then What?",1101168000,"11 23, 2004",2004,3681,"['good', 'see', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'enjoy', 'career', 'renaissance', 'promising', 'start', 'nearly', 'quarter-century', 'ago', 'George', 'Roy', 'Hill', 'A', 'Little', 'Romance', 'prepubescent', 'American', 'falling', 'love', 'Parisian', 'boy', 'who', 'away', 'Venice', 'knowing', 'eye', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'Ironically', 'most', 'recent', 'movie', 'American', 'woman', 'again', 'Italy', 'time', 'escaping', 'broken', 'marriage', 'find', 'fulfillment', 'Tuscan', 'villa', 'buy', 'spot', 'renovate', 'Leave', 'Lane', 'make', 'look', 'reasonable', 'what', 'was', 'precocious', 'earlier', 'movie', 'matured', 'lovely', 'sense', 'self-awareness', 'gravity', 'film', 'beauty', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'striking', 'years', 'also', 'become', 'accomplished', 'displaying', 'several', 'emotions', 'concurrently', 'layering', 'characters', 'complexity', 'feelings', 'can', 'never', 'quite', 'predict', 'what', 'thinking', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'next', 'post-coital', 'train', 'ride', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'Unfaithful', 'great', 'example', 'hard-earned', 'skill', 'Lane', 'skill', 'spades', 'fictionalized', 'version', 'Frances', 'Mayes', 'author', 'book', 'greatly', 'altered', 'movie', 'based', 'character', 'be', 'longing', 'something', 'never', 'quite', 'out', 'actress', 'convincingly', 'sense', 'want', 'fact', 'Lane', 'almost', 'movie', 'not', 'quite.At', 'heart', 'patronizing', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'was', 'produced', 'era', 'entirely', 'somewhere', 'mid-fifties', 'when', 'Lane', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'labeled', 'brazen', 'put-upon', 'woman', 'tainted', 'divorce', 'kept', 'expecting', 'Rosanno', 'Brazzi', 'come', 'out', 'say', 'something', 'ridiculously', 'continental', 'sweep', 'feet', 'Instead', 'get', 'Raoul', 'Bava', 'who', 'smoldering', 'good', 'looks', 'none', 'irony', 'rather', 'trite', 'Italian', 'lover', 'role', 'Lending', 'even', 'more', 'color', 'soap', 'opera', 'atmosphere', 'gallery', 'eccentrics', 'array', 'international', 'accents', 'who', 'serve', 'up', 'allegorical', 'fables', 'Hallmark-card', 'advice', 'heroine', 'empathetic', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'who', 'have', 'crush', 'Frances', 'flirtation', 'wish', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'explored', 'more', 'young', 'lovers', 'who', 'must', 'deal', 'predictably', 'disapproval', 'girl', 'strict', 'parents', 'rest', 'inept', 'dedicated', 'renovation', 'crew', 'English', 'free-spirit', 'who', 'worked', 'Fellini', 'have', 'kept', 'up', 'la', 'dolce', 'vita', 'character', 'real', 'life', 'pregnant', 'lesbian', 'friend', 'abandoned', 'lover', 'Intentionally', 'not', 'Frances', 'help', 'set', 'lives', 'right', 'path', 'picturesquely', 'run-down', 'old', 'villa', 'gradually', 'home', 'dreams', 'serves', 'life-affirming', 'metaphor', 'So', 'many', 'contrivances', 'riddle', 'story', 'especially', 'end', 'when', 'plot', 'threads', 'get', 'tied', 'up', 'quickly', 'Frances', 'fate', 'not', 'satisfying', 'viewer', 'know', 'plot', 'undercooked', 'when', 'minor', 'character', 'introduced', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'provide', 'romantic', 'salvation', 'truth', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'base', 'material', 'story', 'nothing', 'deeper', 'Harlequin', 'romance', 'novels', 'find', 'checkout', 'line', 'Safeway', 'just', 'are', 'lots', 'personal', 'problems', 'floating', 'plot', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'Lane', 'director', 'Audrey', 'Wells', 'who', 'jointly', 'make', 'film', 'anything', 'sad', 'Add', 'travelogue', 'aspect', 'lovely', 'cinematography', 'Geoffrey', 'Simpson', 'Italy', 'beautiful', 'landscapes', 'can', 'think', 'worse', 'ways', 'spend', 'two', 'hours', 'watch', 'true', 'coming-of-age', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'radiant', 'gifted', 'far', 'more', 'deserving', 'material', 'better']",N/A

Why more films aren't made about ditching your crummy life and moving to Tuscany, I haven't figured out.  It's my ultimate fantasy.In addition to that, Diane Lane gives a gracious performance fraught with uncertainty and humility - she doesn't have it all figured out, and she doesn't pretend to.  As a recent divorcee, she is sad and struggling to find herself and figure out what she wants out of life.  The bursts of sadness and loneliness she experiences throughout the movie are heartening and lend credence to her plight-she is a middle-aged woman, who has lost her home and has been tossed aside by her uncaring husband - and she is clearly not going to get over it just because she has moved to a (soon to be) fabulous villa in Tuscany.

I went into this film with very low expectations, boy am I sick of the continuous stream of worthless romantic drivel Hollywood has been turning out lately.  This one is different, folks.  It has something that most films don't: heart.A successful and happily married San Francisco writer, Frances Mayes, life turns upside down when she discovers that her husband is cheating on her and gets a divorce.  Heartbroken, depressed, and suffering from writer's block, her best friend Patti convinces her to take a vacation to Italy.  Acting on a surge of spontaneity, Frances purchases a beautiful yet run-down villa in Tuscany.The script, based on the book of the same name, is just wonderful.  It flows in a beautiful way and the voice-overs by Frances are lyrical and poetic.  The story is full of realistic and fascinating characters, humor, heart, and, of course, the beautiful Tuscan scenery.

The build up to this amusing tour is very creative, also the many antics on the tour bus were funny, due to the ironical fact that a single divorced female was on tour with a group of men - all of whom were gay. It is an amusing, down-right funny film in many ways. It is also an inexpensive way to see the landscapes of Tuscany.Starting a new life in Italy, on a whim, a spur of the moment, the need to escape, escape to another country, escape anywhere, is a fantasy, many people may have, especially if the people are divorced. The adventures of living in another country along with recovering one's sense of balance in life is the well developed topic of this film.The tour bus stops in a town and our heroine sees an old home for sale in the picture window of a real estate office. It happens the tour passes by this very same home  and to the surprise of all, our protaganist asks the bus driver to stop. She enters the house and discovers a young European couple negotiating on the selling price with the owner, who is a widow, and her solicitor. Everytime the European couple offers a bid, the widow raises the price of the house. When our divorcee makes an offer ... the widow accepts it. The Europeann couple stalk off, complaining about how the rich Americans want to own everything.Our divorcee admits to the widow, she can not afford the price she agreed to. The widow shakes her head, sadly, ""no"". The widow states through an interpreter, the solicitor, that she must have a sign from G-d before she can sell the house, right after that, a bird flies in and leaves a parting gift on our divorcee's head. The widow is happy and smiles ... that is the sign. It only gets better from there ... This is hugely funny film, reminds me of the movies made in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

After seeing the film and finding it so completely unrelated to Mayes' book - using it more life a stage on which to create a lot of 'audience pleasing subplots' - this viewer passed on writing a review.  Seeing the film again, years later, without any expectations to meet, was a pleasant surprise.  Get past the Audrey Wells superimposed episodes of Sandra Oh and her baby, of the love affair gone awry, and the Fellini reenactment etc and the film has some charm.  Diane Lane tries her best to make us consider this little story a transformation event and in many cases ti works.  But not always in the manner in which it was intended.What does come shining through are some bit parts by actors who deserve more attention and more exposure.  For instance, the 'workmen' who help Lane's adapted character transform her villa into a 'home' for all manner of folk.  One of the actors who plays the young Pawel, Pawel Szajda, has all the necessary qualities to bloom into a fine career - and hopefully this film will be a springboard for him.  Also Lane's 'at the end of the film only' lover Ed is played by another solid newcomer - David Sutcliff.  Otherwise the possibility of falling in love with beautiful Tuscany is a bit blurred with all the generated little stories that add little to the film.  But then again, it IS durable - which says a lot for the many love affairs with Italy that both the book and the film started!

As another reviewer rightly assessed, obviously the screenwriter could not make enough of the book as it stood (no fault of the book) and therefore made liberal changes of great magnitude to the point where the two have little more in common than a villa in Tuscany.  The film does not capture the spirit of the book, which is that Frances and her best friend Ed are so comfortable in their mutual love and lives together that their joie de vivre naturally extends to the villa, transforming it from a shambles to a beautiful piece of antiquity, as well as to their new surroundings in Italy (the town and people of Cortona).  To their great joy and surprise, Italy embraces them as well.  The book has nothing to do with the Diane Lane character, who spends most of the film looking for love in the wrong places (or crying over love lost due to poor choices), while restoration of the villa and discovery of her new surroundings become a dim backdrop to her own shallow escapades and the problems of her girlfriend (both figments of the screenwriter's imagination).

The male characters, except for the real estate agent, are not developed at all. The plot's premise revolves around a story someone told her. They (the governments of Italy and Austria?) built a railroad between Venice and Vienna through the Alps before they had a train that could make the trip. The point is that you have to have faith that every thing works out for those who make bizarre decisions.

She wants a wedding at her home, a family to live at her house, etc. I agree. There is not much to the plot, but that's okay sometimes.One of the good features of the movie is the scenery.

786837,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B0000VD02Y,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[3, 5]","Having not read the book, I really didn't know what to expect. Let me tell you it was a pleasant surprise. For starters, Diane Lane was the perfect choice for the lead character Frances Mayes. She brings a natural reality to the character, instead of the saccharin sweet typically found in a romantic comedy. Diane instantly makes you feel like you know this woman. She's your neighbor, or someone you work with. In the scene after she learns of her husband's infidelities, she looks horrible - exactly like you'd expect like a woman would look after traumatic news. Of course Diane Lane is a very beautiful woman and as the movie progresses that becomes more and more apparent. Luckily Diane is more than just a pretty face and her performance is stellar. The movie as a whole is understated, letting things play out instead of spelling everything out and Diane provides a wonderful tapestry for you to see what is happening to her. Her reactions tell you more than pithy dialog ever could and as a result you end up taking the journey with her.As much as I loved Diane Lane in this movie, she is surrounded by an incredible supporting cast. Sandra Oh, as the best friend, delivers an authentic performance. Instead of the typical ""funny sidekick"" so often played by those in the role of best friend, she's down to earth and real. Raoul Bova plays the Italian lover and should make most women weak in the knees, but I found Vincent Riotta, the real estate agent, to be a much richer character. And speaking of rich characters, Lindsay Duncan plays a wonderful eccentric as Katherine who almost serves as a fairy godmother.Although the acting is superb, what bring it all together are the talents of Audrey Wells who serves as the screenplay writer, director and producer. Most of Audrey's background has been in writing. Clearly Ms. Wells has a love of Italy and a love of the novel and all of that shows on the screen. She filmed in the cities that are represented and she hired actors that are the nationality in which they play and the age in which they should be. The entire film shines with authenticity and coupled with wonderful performances and directing, Audrey has redefined the romantic comedy. This movie is a tune-up for the soul. If anyone has been down on their luck or not so lucky in love this movie will pour some sweetness into that bitter place.

786842,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B0000VD02Y,Joseph Haschka,"[9, 12]","UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by Frances Mayes, is one of those fantasies of escape likely to appeal to those leading lives of quiet desperation.Diane Lane plays Frances, who's just undergone a bitter divorce made more insulting by the fact that ex-hubbie buys out her share of the house using money supplied by his new woman. Frances moves into an apartment block that specializes in sheltering the recently divorced. The lawyer next door sobs a lot. Then, two of Frances's lesbian friends gift her with a ticket for a tour of Tuscany. So, off she goes, ultimately to impulsively purchase a run-down villa in the hill town of Cortona.  Mayes spends the rest of the story overseeing the restoration of her new digs by a local contractor employing three expatriate Poles, and searching for a new lease on Love.My wife liked this film more than I, but admitted it's a chick flick. I'm giving it four stars chiefly because both Diane Lane and the Italian locations are gorgeous. The whole point of the film is to get the demoralized Frances to the point where she can again say, &quot;I'm emotionally OK and ready to boogie.&quot; A disclaimer in the ending credits states that some characters were altered to enhance the dramatic action. Perhaps buffed up too much in some cases, and not enough in others.For me, the film would have been a much better story had it focused on Frances, the villa's reconstruction, and the engaging personalities of the Poles (Pawel Szajda, Valentine Pelka, and Sasa Vulicevic), and created a relationship with her helpful real estate agent, the sensitive and maturely handsome Martini (Vincent Riotta). However, the screenwriters have Frances involved in too many other subplots requiring an excess of supporting players. There's Katherine (Lindsay Duncan), a flamboyant ex-actress and Fellini protege, who's only purpose in the storyline seems to be to dance in a fountain and advise on how to find men, in this case equated with ladybugs  - essentially, &quot;lie down in the grass and let them come to you&quot;. Then there's gay pal Patti (Sandra Oh), who shows up to have a baby. And hunky Marcello (Raoul Bova), straight off the lurid cover of some bodice-ripper, who admittedly goes a long way in restoring Mayes's sexual self-esteem. (My wife thought Marcello totally necessary to the plot.) Indeed, one of the best scenes has Mayes doing a private victory dance to celebrate the fact that she's still &quot;got it.&quot;Diane Lane's last outing (UNFAITHFUL) garnered her a well-deserved Oscar nomination. Her role in UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN is nowhere near to being as accomplished a performance. But for this viewer, who's been in love with Ms. Lane since her appearance in 1989's LONESOME DOVE as the sweetly vulnerable prostitute Lorena, it more than sufficed as an endorphin fix.",4,Looking for ladybugs,1066435200,"10 18, 2003",2003,2858,"['TUSCAN', 'SUN', 'based', 'non-fiction', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Frances', 'Mayes', 'one', 'fantasies', 'escape', 'likely', 'appeal', 'leading', 'lives', 'quiet', 'desperation.Diane', 'Lane', 'Frances', 'who', 'just', 'undergone', 'bitter', 'divorce', 'made', 'more', 'insulting', 'fact', 'ex-hubbie', 'buys', 'out', 'share', 'house', 'using', 'money', 'supplied', 'new', 'woman', 'Frances', 'moves', 'apartment', 'block', 'sheltering', 'recently', 'divorced', 'lawyer', 'next', 'door', 'lot', 'Then', 'two', 'Frances', 'lesbian', 'friends', 'ticket', 'tour', 'Tuscany', 'So', 'ultimately', 'impulsively', 'purchase', 'run-down', 'villa', 'hill', 'town', 'Cortona', 'Mayes', 'rest', 'story', 'overseeing', 'restoration', 'new', 'digs', 'local', 'contractor', 'employing', 'three', 'expatriate', 'Poles', 'searching', 'new', 'lease', 'Love.My', 'wife', 'liked', 'film', 'more', 'admitted', 'chick', 'flick', ""'m"", 'giving', 'four', 'stars', 'chiefly', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Italian', 'locations', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'whole', 'point', 'film', 'get', 'demoralized', 'Frances', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'again', 'say', 'quot', ""'m"", 'emotionally', 'OK', 'ready', 'boogie.', 'quot', 'disclaimer', 'ending', 'credits', 'states', 'characters', 'were', 'altered', 'enhance', 'dramatic', 'action', 'Perhaps', 'buffed', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'cases', 'not', 'enough', 'others.For', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'story', 'had', 'focused', 'Frances', 'villa', 'reconstruction', 'engaging', 'personalities', 'Poles', 'Pawel', 'Szajda', 'Valentine', 'Pelka', 'Sasa', 'Vulicevic', 'created', 'relationship', 'helpful', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'sensitive', 'maturely', 'handsome', 'Martini', 'Vincent', 'Riotta', 'However', 'screenwriters', 'have', 'Frances', 'involved', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'subplots', 'requiring', 'excess', 'supporting', 'players', 'Katherine', 'Lindsay', 'Duncan', 'flamboyant', 'ex-actress', 'Fellini', 'protege', 'who', 'only', 'purpose', 'storyline', 'be', 'dance', 'fountain', 'advise', 'how', 'find', 'men', 'case', 'equated', 'ladybugs', 'essentially', 'quot', 'down', 'grass', 'let', 'come', 'quot', 'Then', 'gay', 'pal', 'Patti', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'who', 'up', 'have', 'baby', 'hunky', 'Marcello', 'Raoul', 'Bova', 'straight', 'off', 'lurid', 'cover', 'bodice-ripper', 'who', 'admittedly', 'long', 'way', 'restoring', 'Mayes', 'sexual', 'self-esteem', 'wife', 'thought', 'Marcello', 'totally', 'necessary', 'plot', 'Indeed', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'Mayes', 'doing', 'private', 'victory', 'dance', 'celebrate', 'fact', 'still', 'quot', 'got', 'it.', 'quot', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'last', 'outing', 'UNFAITHFUL', 'garnered', 'well-deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'role', 'UNDER', 'THE', 'TUSCAN', 'SUN', 'nowhere', 'near', 'being', 'accomplished', 'performance', 'viewer', 'who', 'been', 'love', 'Ms.', 'Lane', 'appearance', '1989', 'LONESOME', 'DOVE', 'sweetly', 'vulnerable', 'prostitute', 'Lorena', 'more', 'sufficed', 'endorphin', 'fix']",N/A

786864,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000VD02Y,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 6]","This movie has two things going for it that are quite appealing to me.  One is Diane Lane because we are now both old enough that I do not have to feel guilty about having a crush on her in 1979 when she was barely a teenager and I was in graduate school.  The other is Tuscany, because films like this are siren calls for tourists, especially if half the blood flowing in your veins is Italian in the first place.  As a result of those twin forces I probably had higher expectations for this film than is warranted by what director Audrey Wells has put together.The story is relatively simple.  Frances Mayes is a writer and critic who finds out her husband is having an affair.  There is more injury to add to this insult in terms of divorce, alimony that she owes him, and the loss of her house.  With nothing better to do Frances is sent by her friend Patti (Sandra Oh) on a gay bus tour of Tuscany where she stumbles across a nice little villa for sale.  Frances knows that the way her life is going buying it would be a terrible idea.  But an eccentric expatriate named Katherine (Lindsay Duncan) tells her, &quot;Don't you just love those?&quot;  So it comes to pass that Frances buys a Italian villa that is in as much need of repair as her own shattered life.The villa is obviously the master metaphor in this film for the main character, but Wells does not spend as much time on it as she should.  Maybe it is because Bob Villa and all of those who have followed in his wake have been the restoration of old homes a familiar experience for us.  One of the deleted scenes on the DVD shows the discovery of the fresco on one of the villa's walls, which is exactly the sort of detail that we want to enjoy.  We know that this house will be a home by the end of the film, so it is the process of transformation that matters, especially as it parallels that of Frances herself.This movie wants to be unconventional.  At one point Frances unburdens herself and is told by the compassionate man to whom she is speaking: &quot;Signora, please stop being so sad. If you continue like this, I will be forced to make love to you, and I've never been unfaithful to my wife.&quot;  This movie is not Katharine Hepburn's trip to Italy in &quot;Summertime.&quot;  For those who are waiting expectantly for the new man in Frances' life to come walking through the door, this film is going to tease you in that regard until you are forced to think that maybe something else is happening here.I know that Wells took great liberties with the book written by the real Frances Mayes, who restored an abandoned villa in Italy without the motivation of a brutal divorce, but since the author did not complain and I have not read the book I have no reason to complain on that score.  Instead I will point to the fact this film is only 102 minutes long and that if this film had clocked in close to two hours Wells would have been able to flesh out the restoration of the villa and the eccentric neighbors that become so important in the cinematic Frances' new life as she goes native.The end of the film recognizes the importance of those two elements, but they are often overwhelmed over the course of &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot; by the less than satisfactory romantic elements.  Fortunately Lane's performance forgives many of the fault's of the script and shows that after her Oscar nominated performance in &quot;Unfaithful&quot; that she now has some serious momentum going on in her acting career.  She is so busy being at the center of this story of how Frances puts her life back together than both the character and the audience are surprised by the arrival of the requisite happy ending.In the final analysis &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot; is not going to convert anyone.  Confirmed romantics are going to find enough of what they crave in this film to make themselves happy and those who roll their eyes at such endeavors will have ample occasion to keep their orbs spinning.  Those who read Mayes' novel will be wondering why they even bothered to keep her name for the main character and those who are fans of Diane Lane will simply be ecstatic to see her name appearing above the title.",4,Diane Lane renovates a villa and her life in Tuscany,1082160000,"04 17, 2004",2004,4193,"['movie', 'two', 'things', 'going', 'are', 'quite', 'appealing', 'One', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'are', 'now', 'old', 'enough', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'feel', 'guilty', 'having', 'crush', '1979', 'when', 'was', 'barely', 'teenager', 'was', 'graduate', 'school', 'other', 'Tuscany', 'films', 'are', 'siren', 'calls', 'tourists', 'especially', 'blood', 'flowing', 'veins', 'Italian', 'first', 'place', 'result', 'twin', 'forces', 'probably', 'had', 'higher', 'expectations', 'film', 'warranted', 'what', 'director', 'Audrey', 'Wells', 'put', 'together.The', 'story', 'relatively', 'simple', 'Frances', 'Mayes', 'writer', 'critic', 'who', 'out', 'husband', 'having', 'affair', 'more', 'injury', 'add', 'insult', 'terms', 'divorce', 'alimony', 'loss', 'house', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'Frances', 'sent', 'friend', 'Patti', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'gay', 'tour', 'Tuscany', 'where', 'nice', 'little', 'villa', 'sale', 'Frances', 'way', 'life', 'going', 'buying', 'would', 'be', 'terrible', 'idea', 'eccentric', 'expatriate', 'named', 'Katherine', 'Lindsay', 'Duncan', 'quot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'just', 'love', 'quot', 'pass', 'Frances', 'Italian', 'villa', 'as', 'much', 'need', 'repair', 'own', 'shattered', 'life.The', 'villa', 'obviously', 'master', 'metaphor', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'Wells', 'not', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'should', 'Maybe', 'Bob', 'Villa', 'who', 'have', 'followed', 'wake', 'have', 'been', 'restoration', 'old', 'homes', 'familiar', 'experience', 'One', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'discovery', 'fresco', 'one', 'villa', 'walls', 'exactly', 'sort', 'detail', 'want', 'enjoy', 'know', 'house', 'will', 'be', 'home', 'end', 'film', 'process', 'transformation', 'matters', 'especially', 'Frances', 'herself.This', 'movie', 'be', 'unconventional', 'one', 'point', 'Frances', 'told', 'compassionate', 'man', 'whom', 'speaking', 'quot', 'Signora', 'please', 'stop', 'being', 'so', 'sad', 'continue', 'will', 'be', 'forced', 'make', 'love', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'unfaithful', 'wife.', 'quot', 'movie', 'not', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'trip', 'Italy', 'quot', 'Summertime.', 'quot', 'who', 'are', 'waiting', 'expectantly', 'new', 'man', 'Frances', 'life', 'come', 'walking', 'door', 'film', 'going', 'tease', 'regard', 'are', 'forced', 'think', 'maybe', 'something', 'else', 'happening', 'here.I', 'know', 'Wells', 'took', 'great', 'liberties', 'book', 'written', 'real', 'Frances', 'Mayes', 'who', 'restored', 'abandoned', 'villa', 'Italy', 'motivation', 'brutal', 'divorce', 'author', 'did', 'not', 'complain', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'have', 'reason', 'complain', 'score', 'Instead', 'will', 'point', 'fact', 'film', 'only', '102', 'minutes', 'long', 'film', 'had', 'clocked', 'close', 'two', 'hours', 'Wells', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'flesh', 'out', 'restoration', 'villa', 'eccentric', 'neighbors', 'become', 'so', 'important', 'cinematic', 'Frances', 'new', 'life', 'native.The', 'end', 'film', 'importance', 'two', 'elements', 'are', 'often', 'overwhelmed', 'course', 'quot', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'quot', 'less', 'satisfactory', 'romantic', 'elements', 'Fortunately', 'Lane', 'performance', 'many', 'fault', 'script', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'quot', 'Unfaithful', 'quot', 'now', 'serious', 'momentum', 'going', 'acting', 'career', 'so', 'busy', 'being', 'center', 'story', 'how', 'Frances', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'character', 'audience', 'are', 'surprised', 'arrival', 'requisite', 'happy', 'final', 'analysis', 'quot', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'quot', 'not', 'going', 'convert', 'anyone', 'Confirmed', 'romantics', 'are', 'going', 'find', 'enough', 'what', 'crave', 'film', 'make', 'happy', 'who', 'roll', 'eyes', 'such', 'endeavors', 'will', 'have', 'ample', 'occasion', 'keep', 'orbs', 'spinning', 'who', 'read', 'Mayes', 'novel', 'will', 'be', 'wondering', 'why', 'even', 'bothered', 'keep', 'name', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'will', 'simply', 'be', 'ecstatic', 'see', 'name', 'appearing', 'title']",N/A

She falls in love with the place and impulsively decides to try her luck living there after spoting a dilapidated looking villa in a small town called Cortona.  She thinks she can fix it up herself, but in the end hires a handyman to help out.  She starts to enjoy life again and meets a handsome local guy called Marcello.While I really liked this movie, I didn't love it.  It does drag a little, but overall, it's sweet, charming, romantic and absolutely visually stunning.  It really makes me want to go and visit this part of Italy.

Diane Lane gives a deeply endearing and enrapturing performance as a heartbroken writer remaking her life and a villa in Italy. Based on the literary travel memoirs of San Francisco journalist Frances Mayes, Under the Tuscan Sun is a testament to one of the most lion-hearted things the human heart can do - have the courage to love again despite the scars of betrayal, abandonment, and traumatic sorrow. In the blink of an eye Frances Mayes' world is turned upside-down when a seemingly happy marriage ends in divorce. Life as she knows it is in tatters and Frances switches scenery to recover from a shattering experience. From the salt air of San Francisco to the kiss of the Tuscan sun rays does Frances slowly recuperate the fragments of her heart and a villa in need of some repair. On the way she re-experiences the magic and miracle of romance, a new love, and a life in Italy that she never imagined.

Not exactly unpredictable, but cute, funny, and with an unusual structure, it is much better than the average romance. Screenwriter and Director Audrey Wells had the difficult task of adapting a travelogue book into a fiction film and for the most part, succeeded. The result is an enjoyable, light-hearted, and decently paced dramedy.Diane Lane is perfectly cast and Sandra Oh IS Patti. They both bring so much to all their roles and greatly enhanced the story and move it forward.

786887,A319KYEIAZ3SON,B0000VD02Y,Mary Whipple,"[9, 12]","(3.5 stars) Based on the captivating memoir of author Frances Mayes, this fictionalized version of her story becomes a completely different creation--far more romantic, more predictable, and more obvious than the memoir.  Here in the film, Frances, recovering from a devastating divorce, accepts a ten-day trip to Tuscany from two friends, leaves the tour group, and discovers and buys an abandoned villa.  With her own imagination and the help of an inexperienced Polish crew, which has the predictable number of construction disasters, she renovates the old villa, always hoping that some day there will be a wedding, preferably her own to the perfect man, and a family to give life to the old place.The scenery is beautiful (of course), the vistas are endless and well-photographed, and the challenges of making the old house both livable and comfortable are never-ending.  Walls falling down, a violent thunderstorm, a visiting owl, and unlimited problems with the plumbing keep the humor visual and the viewer amused.  Frances's affair and the unexpected arrival of a pregnant friend from home add intrigue and keep the complications coming.  A secondary Romeo-and-Juliet plot involving the teenaged daughter of one of her neighbors and the Polish teenager working on Frances's house, add ""depth"" to Frances's own search for romantic happiness.  Ultimately, the film ends as the viewer expects it will--romantically satisfying.The subtlety of the book, with its lovely descriptions of the countryside and its people and its sense of reality, are sacrificed here in favor of visual excitement, humor, and ongoing love stories, and Frances's (real) self-discovery becomes trite moralizing in the film, as seen in the quotation that begins this review.  Diane Lane is charming as Frances, but she, nevertheless, looks older than the young men to whom she seems to be attracted, and the gay subplot involving her friends and the tour which brings her to Tuscany are extraneous (but politically correct).  Highly romantic and fun to watch, this film is a disappointingly Hollywood-ized version of a thoughtful and charming memoir. n Mary Whipple",3,"""Never lose your childish enthusiasm, and everything will come your way.""",1160179200,"10 7, 2006",2006,2145,"['3.5', 'stars', 'Based', 'captivating', 'memoir', 'author', 'Frances', 'Mayes', 'fictionalized', 'version', 'story', 'completely', 'different', 'creation', 'far', 'more', 'romantic', 'more', 'predictable', 'more', 'obvious', 'memoir', 'Here', 'film', 'Frances', 'recovering', 'devastating', 'divorce', 'ten-day', 'trip', 'Tuscany', 'two', 'friends', 'tour', 'group', 'discovers', 'abandoned', 'villa', 'own', 'imagination', 'help', 'inexperienced', 'Polish', 'crew', 'predictable', 'number', 'construction', 'disasters', 'old', 'villa', 'always', 'hoping', 'day', 'will', 'be', 'wedding', 'preferably', 'own', 'perfect', 'man', 'family', 'give', 'life', 'old', 'place.The', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'course', 'vistas', 'are', 'endless', 'well-photographed', 'challenges', 'making', 'old', 'house', 'livable', 'comfortable', 'are', 'never-ending', 'Walls', 'falling', 'down', 'violent', 'thunderstorm', 'visiting', 'owl', 'unlimited', 'problems', 'plumbing', 'keep', 'humor', 'visual', 'viewer', 'amused', 'Frances', 'affair', 'unexpected', 'arrival', 'pregnant', 'friend', 'home', 'add', 'intrigue', 'keep', 'complications', 'coming', 'secondary', 'Romeo-and-Juliet', 'plot', 'involving', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'one', 'neighbors', 'Polish', 'teenager', 'working', 'Frances', 'house', 'add', 'depth', 'Frances', 'own', 'search', 'romantic', 'happiness', 'Ultimately', 'film', 'viewer', 'will', 'romantically', 'satisfying.The', 'subtlety', 'book', 'lovely', 'descriptions', 'countryside', 'people', 'sense', 'reality', 'are', 'sacrificed', 'here', 'favor', 'visual', 'excitement', 'humor', 'ongoing', 'love', 'stories', 'Frances', 'real', 'self-discovery', 'trite', 'moralizing', 'film', 'seen', 'quotation', 'review', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'charming', 'Frances', 'nevertheless', 'older', 'young', 'men', 'whom', 'be', 'attracted', 'gay', 'subplot', 'involving', 'friends', 'tour', 'Tuscany', 'are', 'extraneous', 'politically', 'correct', 'Highly', 'romantic', 'fun', 'watch', 'film', 'disappointingly', 'Hollywood-ized', 'version', 'thoughtful', 'charming', 'memoir', 'n', 'Mary', 'Whipple']",N/A

If you hate romantic comedies then go see this movie.I am not a huge fan of the romantic comedy genre. More often than not, a romantic comedy is nothing more than a few good looking people thrown together and saddled with a lousy script. That's not to say that there aren't notable exceptions, but for the most part they suck. Based on the previews for this movie, I didn't have high hopes, however I did receive a free pass to watch a sneak preview for the movie, so how could I say no?Having not read the book, I really didn't know what to expect. Let me tell you it was a pleasant surprise. For starters, Diane Lane was the perfect choice for the lead character Frances Mayes. She brings a natural reality to the character, instead of the saccharin sweet typically found in a romantic comedy. Diane instantly makes you feel like you know this woman. She's your neighbor, or someone you work with. In the scene after she learns of her husband's infidelities, she looks horrible - exactly like you'd expect like a woman would look after traumatic news. Of course Diane Lane is a very beautiful woman and as the movie progresses that becomes more and more apparent. Luckily Diane is more than just a pretty face and her performance is stellar. The movie as a whole is understated, letting things play out instead of spelling everything out and Diane provides a wonderful tapestry for you to see what is happening to her. Her reactions tell you more than pithy dialog ever could and as a result you end up taking the journey with her.As much as I loved Diane Lane in this movie, she is surrounded by an incredible supporting cast. Sandra Oh, as the best friend, delivers an authentic performance. Instead of the typical ""funny sidekick"" so often played by those in the role of best friend, she's down to earth and real. Raoul Bova plays the Italian lover and should make most women weak in the knees, but I found Vincent Riotta, the real estate agent, to be a much richer character. And speaking of rich characters, Lindsay Duncan plays a wonderful eccentric as Katherine who almost serves as a fairy godmother.Although the acting is surpurb, what brings it all together are the talents of Audrey Wells who serves as the screenplay writer, director and producer. Most of Audrey's background has been in writing. This is only her second film as a director, yet you wouldn't know it by watching the film. Clearly Ms. Wells has a love of Italy and a love of the novel and all of that shows on the screen. She filmed in the cities that are represented and she hired actors that are the nationality in which they play and the age in which they should be. The entire films shines with authenticity and coupled with wonderful performances and directing, Audrey has redefined the romantic comedy.This movie was refreshing, witty, poetic, dramatic and rich with characters that you not only like, but identify with. It was such a breath of fresh air that I'm ready to see it again and again. This film is definitely going into my DVD collection.",4,If you love Italy then go see this movie.,1077840000,"02 27, 2004",2004,3145,"['love', 'Italy', 'then', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'like', 'real', 'intelligent', 'characters', 'then', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'hate', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'then', 'go', 'see', 'movie.I', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'genre', 'More', 'often', 'not', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'nothing', 'more', 'few', 'good', 'looking', 'people', 'together', 'saddled', 'lousy', 'script', 'not', 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'notable', 'exceptions', 'most', 'part', 'suck', 'Based', 'previews', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'however', 'did', 'receive', 'free', 'pass', 'watch', 'sneak', 'preview', 'movie', 'how', 'could', 'say', 'Having', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Let', 'tell', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'starters', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'lead', 'character', 'Frances', 'Mayes', 'natural', 'reality', 'character', 'instead', 'saccharin', 'sweet', 'typically', 'found', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Diane', 'instantly', 'feel', 'know', 'woman', 'neighbor', 'someone', 'work', 'scene', 'husband', 'infidelities', 'horrible', 'exactly', ""'d"", 'expect', 'woman', 'would', 'look', 'traumatic', 'news', 'course', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'very', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'movie', 'more', 'more', 'apparent', 'Luckily', 'Diane', 'more', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'performance', 'stellar', 'movie', 'whole', 'understated', 'letting', 'things', 'play', 'out', 'instead', 'spelling', 'everything', 'out', 'Diane', 'wonderful', 'tapestry', 'see', 'what', 'happening', 'reactions', 'tell', 'more', 'pithy', 'dialog', 'ever', 'could', 'result', 'end', 'up', 'taking', 'journey', 'her.As', 'much', 'loved', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'movie', 'surrounded', 'incredible', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'best', 'friend', 'authentic', 'performance', 'Instead', 'typical', 'funny', 'sidekick', 'so', 'often', 'played', 'role', 'best', 'friend', 'down', 'earth', 'real', 'Raoul', 'Bova', 'Italian', 'lover', 'should', 'make', 'most', 'women', 'weak', 'knees', 'found', 'Vincent', 'Riotta', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'be', 'much', 'richer', 'character', 'speaking', 'rich', 'characters', 'Lindsay', 'Duncan', 'wonderful', 'eccentric', 'Katherine', 'who', 'almost', 'fairy', 'acting', 'surpurb', 'what', 'together', 'are', 'talents', 'Audrey', 'Wells', 'who', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'director', 'producer', 'Most', 'Audrey', 'background', 'been', 'writing', 'only', 'second', 'film', 'director', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'watching', 'film', 'Clearly', 'Ms.', 'Wells', 'love', 'Italy', 'love', 'novel', 'screen', 'filmed', 'cities', 'are', 'represented', 'hired', 'actors', 'are', 'nationality', 'play', 'age', 'should', 'be', 'entire', 'films', 'shines', 'authenticity', 'coupled', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'directing', 'Audrey', 'redefined', 'romantic', 'comedy.This', 'movie', 'was', 'refreshing', 'witty', 'poetic', 'dramatic', 'rich', 'characters', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'such', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', ""'m"", 'ready', 'see', 'again', 'again', 'film', 'definitely', 'going', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A

After the divorce Frances goes to Tuscany on a lark, falls in love with a villa there, buys it and proceeds to renovate it.

Both were child stars, both posses a similar beauty and way with a smile that turns up just so on the sides. Each is a multi-layered actress of considerable talent. And above all they have made me fall rapturously in love with them.  My ability therefore to give a rational review of this film, ""Under The Tuscan Sun"" is reduced to that of a love struck thirteen year old boy.From the book of the same name by Frances Mayes the film is an altered and fresh look at the original. The direction and screenplay by Audrey Wells is top notch and she gives an insightful commentary on the DVD of her film.  It is in her screenplay is where she really shines. She reshapes Mayes book into something magical and infuses it with the charm and glamour of Italy both in the flesh and in the movies.Vincent Riotta is the quite center to the story and is the romantic realist who gently leads Frances into her adventure in Italy. He commands your attention with a quiet and wise presence. Raoul Bova, one of the hottest stars in Italy brings just the right touch of romance and danger to his role as Marcello. In his final scene he is both honest and fair.Sandra Oh hits all the right notes of comedy and drama as Frances' best friend Patti. Her remark on the steaming toilet is a study in comedy timing. Well, she is a master as anyone who has seen her work on Arliss can attest.The wonderful discovery in this film for me is the British actress, Lindsay Duncan who portrays Katherine, the ex-Fellini star who is trapped like a fly in amber by her film past but lives for today within her celluloid cocoon.  Adding her to the mix puts just the right touch of cinema magic into the story. I am looking forward to see what she does on the upcoming HBO series ""Rome"".Finally there is Miss Lane. Her work here is brilliant and filled with the grit and grime of a true actress at work. Yet it is seamless and so natural without a false move or an unsure moment. She inhabits Frances from frame one and caries her and the audience from her despair to rebirth and rejoicing in a new and unexpected life. Her eyes, her smile, her glowing skin become so real on the screen and we find we are given a gift from this actress of so many gifts. We are given the pure joy of watching her in the here and now inhabit a space in our hearts.

Diane Lane far outshines the various inadequacies of the story and its script.  Granted, Ms. Lane could coast through this bit of fluff relying on little more than her luminescent beauty alone, yet she provides plenty of texture and nuance to her role as a writer/reviewer looking to rebound from a particularly painful divorce.Lane's character, Frances is persuaded to take the place of two lesbian friends on a guided tour of Tuscany (under the banner of ""We're Gay... and Away"").  Believably or not, she leaves the tour mid-bus ride to purchase a small villa in need of a lot of repair.  The ""uprooting your life on a whim"" device is a little trite, but then who hasn't fantasized about a dramatic relocation as the cure for a life crisis?  From there the story (what little there is of it) balances between a voyage of personal discovery and the tale of an Italian money pit (a lire loser perhaps).Sandra Oh does well as Frances' pregnant friend and Lindsay Duncan catches notice in a poorly defined role as the local eccentric expatriate, but neither actress is given much purpose other than to provide dialogue and the occasional mild shock.  The real costar here is the gorgeous scenery of Tuscan Italy, so much so that I'd recommend this movie to anyone contemplating a vacation to that region.The ultimate verdict regarding Under the Tuscan Sun is that it is light fare, that provides a visual feast combining the wonderful appeal of one of Hollywood's truly great beauties along with some of the most romantic countryside you'll ever see.

I liked this movie because it reminded me of several quirky movies I identified with. It has elements of Beaches and Shirley Valentine and, contrary to the negative reviews I have read here, that CAN be a good thing. It is a very visual movie and Ms. Lane feels her character so much that you feel with her and that speaks volumes. Her character does point out that she is making choices because she is tired of playing it safe so yes, she does sleep with a man she has barely met. If you are one of those people who quietly cheer the fed up employee who tells the boss to shove it and wish you could too, you will understand this movie. BUT.

786899,A1K9IW99EFBZ52,B0000VD02Y,Mike,"[1, 1]","I have this movie on my short list of fairy tale / fable / suspension of disbelief movies, along with other ""some people love it / some people hate it"" films likeSerendipity,About Schmidt,Something's Gotta Give,Sideways (Widescreen Edition), andLocal Hero.These films all have one thing in common: the protagonists find themselves in situations where life hasn't turned out the way they planned, or a major ""life event"" takes something away from them, and in their own moment of lack and the inevitable pull toward self-pity, they find that the less they focus on what they lack and more on the blessings they have (usually in the form of other people in their lives), the more the their needs are met...and often on a grander scale than they'd previously imagined.In short, some times you lay down and get up to find yourself covered with ladybugs. People who have seen the film will get that reference immediately.There are a number of reasons to watch the movie, beginning with Diane Lane. She manages to bring the viewer right up to the point where they might be turned off by the whining and self-pity, and theby stop ""rooting for"" her...but she never crosses that line. She keeps her character human, and part of being human is feeling loss and disappointment. What separates the people who stay in that frame of mind from the ones who eventually prosper is a willingness to get up and keep moving, even when ""life hurts"" and you'd rather not.That's what the movie is all about. In the beginning, following her divorce, her friend Patti (the amazing Sandra Oh) tries to convince her to take a trip to Tuscany. She decides she can't, and relocates the pity party to a cramped, noisy apartment. Fortunately, she lacks a tolerance for her new environment and it's off to Tuscany we go.From that point on, there are too many spoilers, so I'll stop here. My feeling is that there are probably more people who have seen the movie and are reading the reviews to see what others think than there are people deciding if they want to watch it.In the modern, cynical world, there is a certain amount of scorn directed toward these little ""fables"" and ""life lessons."" However, taking a moment to watch them reminds us that we are all human, we are all fragile, and we all can make a simple decision to do the best we can with what we have, and to always give thanks for what we've got.",5,"""They built the tracks before there was a train that could make the trip...""",1253923200,"09 26, 2009",2009,2379,"['have', 'movie', 'short', 'list', 'fairy', 'tale', '/', 'fable', '/', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'movies', 'other', 'people', 'love', 'people', 'hate', 'films', 'likeSerendipity', 'Schmidt', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'Sideways', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'andLocal', 'Hero.These', 'films', 'have', 'one', 'thing', 'common', 'protagonists', 'find', 'situations', 'where', 'life', ""n't"", 'turned', 'out', 'way', 'planned', 'major', 'life', 'event', 'something', 'away', 'own', 'moment', 'lack', 'inevitable', 'pull', 'self-pity', 'find', 'less', 'focus', 'what', 'lack', 'more', 'blessings', 'have', 'usually', 'form', 'other', 'people', 'lives', 'more', 'needs', 'are', 'met', 'often', 'grander', 'scale', ""'d"", 'previously', 'imagined.In', 'short', 'times', 'lay', 'down', 'get', 'up', 'find', 'covered', 'ladybugs', 'People', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'will', 'get', 'reference', 'are', 'number', 'reasons', 'watch', 'movie', 'beginning', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'bring', 'viewer', 'right', 'up', 'point', 'where', 'might', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'whining', 'self-pity', 'theby', 'stop', 'rooting', 'never', 'line', 'character', 'human', 'part', 'being', 'human', 'feeling', 'loss', 'disappointment', 'What', 'people', 'who', 'stay', 'frame', 'mind', 'ones', 'who', 'eventually', 'prosper', 'willingness', 'get', 'up', 'keep', 'moving', 'even', 'when', 'life', 'hurts', ""'d"", 'rather', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'beginning', 'following', 'divorce', 'friend', 'Patti', 'amazing', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'convince', 'take', 'trip', 'Tuscany', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pity', 'party', 'cramped', 'noisy', 'apartment', 'Fortunately', 'tolerance', 'new', 'environment', 'Tuscany', 'go.From', 'point', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'spoilers', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'here', 'feeling', 'are', 'probably', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'are', 'reading', 'reviews', 'see', 'what', 'others', 'think', 'are', 'people', 'deciding', 'want', 'watch', 'it.In', 'modern', 'cynical', 'world', 'certain', 'amount', 'scorn', 'directed', 'little', 'fables', 'life', 'lessons', 'However', 'taking', 'moment', 'watch', 'are', 'human', 'are', 'fragile', 'can', 'make', 'simple', 'decision', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'what', 'have', 'always', 'give', 'thanks', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got']",N/A

Moore,"[0, 0]","Tuscany is perhaps my favorite place on Earth, and I've been a fan of Diane Lane at least since Lonesome Dove, so when I heard she was starring in the film version of Frances Mayes' ""Under the Tuscan Sun,"" I said, ""I'm there!"" Lane--in her first film as the sole over-the-title star--gives her usual lovely, fresh and graceful performance in a genial and charming film. Mayes gave writer-director Audrey Wells total permission to create a plot where the original book had none; while Wells plays fast and free with the details of Mayes' life (for example, Mayes already had a second husband when she bought Bramasole), Mayes certainly doesn't seem to mind, so we shouldn't either. Wells' plot has a lot of humor, a little heartbreak, a wisecracking lesbian best friend (Sandra Oh), a flamboyant English actress (Lindsay Duncan), an enigmatic old man (Mario Monicelli), and a pair of incredibly adorable teenage lovers, along with a childbirth, fields of glowing sunflowers and many sumptuous Italian meals. Basically, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is a charming, pretty movie about charming, pretty people doing charming, pretty things. That doesn't make a masterpiece, but it does make an extremely pleasant way to pass two hours. (Note: Lindsay Duncan also appeared in the TV version of ""A Year in Provence.""

I will give this movie some credit. If I had to rate this movie based on scenery and physical environment I would give it 5 stars all the way! The scenery was breathtaking and gorgeous! However....The rest was just awful! The whole storyline is predictable and it's another example of Hollywood using the same formula at scoring for an audience. This movie had the potential to be good, I just wish Hollywood didn't interfere with the process. Because it is a Hollywood film, it has no depth and every problem had (surprise surprise!) a miracle-fairytale-love-can-conquer-all-happily-ever-after-solution. In typical fashion, the movie is also full of ignorant stereotypes. You have your leading beautiful, blond actress (Diane Lane - who is not a bad actress that's why I feel sorry for her that she had to be in this film), a token Asian friend (because of course you need a minority to be correct in Hollywood's ridiculously politically correct world), and of course Italian people that they stereotyped to death. If you talk to any real Italian or European person they will tell you that this is a disgrace to what Europeans pride themselves on being.

Also, you cannot totally dis a film with the achingly handsome Raoul (forget his last name, but he played Marcello.)  I am a chick-flick loving female and he was just gorgeous, even when he was dumping her.However, some elements were too obvious.  She's closed off emotionally and sexually, and can't find the snake that's just entered her house.  Gee, what must the SNAKE symbolize?  Oh, and just before she physically hooks up with the scrumptious Marcello, whom she has just met, a KITTEN appears.  There's some nasty-word foreboding going on!I don't care how hurt you are.  It never makes good sense to drive an hour with a man whom you just met in a foreign country.  I can suspend disbelief, but that was just foolish, even in a chick flick.Additionally, the animation sequence of the sun setting and rising during the kiss was jarring.  Same for the strange movement when she gazed into the old picture.I did enjoy Sandra Oh's performance, and even the sterotyped eccentric Lindsey Duncan had her moments. But the sum of the parts do not make a whole.  It's worth renting, but not buying.I was most disappointed with the dependent-victim theme.  Frances loses her life, finds hunky lover, loses hunky lover and begins to realize that perhaps the world revolves around more than her having a man.  MAYBE her happiness can spring from inside, as in that of emotionally healthy people.  This point would have been a great stopping point.

786935,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0000VD02Y,Robert Moore,"[1, 2]","In a way, I liked this movie a lot more than perhaps I ought.  For one thing, I am a guy, and this is very definitely a chick flick (hint for the guys:  a great movie to take her on a date).  It is also a tad predictable, though it is not without a few surprises.  And at times it feels more like a succession of postcards than a film, so perfect does Tuscany look throughout the picture.So why did I enjoy it so much?  First, because of the very wonderful performance of Diane Lane as Frances Mayes, the real life author of the book upon which this film is based (and which I must confess I have not read).  In my mind, Lane has always been way, way underutilized by Hollywood.  She has always shown herself to be an actress of the highest caliber, but for some reason she has not always been granted the kinds of roles that she ought to have received.  She is onscreen in this film for very nearly the entire length, and the film is all the better for that.  She is also quite beautiful in a seemingly accessible way, and I really loved watching her marvelously expressive face throughout the film.Although the film really does, as I mentioned above, seem sometimes like a succession of postcards or the pictures of a Tuscan calendar, there is no question that the film is surreally beautiful.  The town of Cartona looks so exquisite that one is immediately seized with dreams of winning the lottery and moving therewith.  It is quite easy to understand why anyone would love to live in such a marvelous place.  And the brief scenes in Positano make it look like a perhaps even more beautiful spot than Cartona.  There is no question:  this is a very gorgeous movie to look at, though perhaps a tad too perfect.  One begins to wonder if there were imperfections in the region that the camera chose to ignore.  But no matter; this is a fantasy, and the beauty was quite appropriate to the mood of the film.The villa that she purchases more or less becomes one of the major characters in the film.  It is lovely thing, a bit dilapidated at the beginning, but by the end of the film it is transformed to something cared for and caring in return.  The prospect from the villa is breathtaking, with the gently rolling hills filling most of the view, with mountains in the distant.  Her bedroom is definitely a room with a view.  This is all played to great advantage in the remarkable scene were a lightening storm seems to ravage the area, with a lightening bolt striking a washing machine in her front yard, and with an owl flying into her bedroom to escape the chaos outside.Finally, I enjoyed the collection of friends--for such they became in the end--in Tuscany.  Although Frances goes there as a stranger, by the end of the film she possesses a large and wide-ranging group of friends.  One comes to like and know them all, and feel some of the affection for them that Frances feels.This is not one of the great films one is likely to see this year or any other, but it is a warm, likable, beautiful film, and it is hard to imagine many not giving in to its charms.",5,"A warm, easy to enjoy tale of remaking one's life",1062460800,"09 2, 2003",2003,3069,"['way', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'perhaps', 'ought', 'one', 'thing', 'am', 'guy', 'very', 'definitely', 'chick', 'flick', 'hint', 'guys', 'great', 'movie', 'take', 'date', 'also', 'tad', 'predictable', 'not', 'few', 'surprises', 'times', 'more', 'succession', 'postcards', 'film', 'so', 'perfect', 'Tuscany', 'look', 'picture.So', 'why', 'did', 'enjoy', 'so', 'much', 'First', 'very', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Frances', 'Mayes', 'real', 'life', 'author', 'book', 'film', 'based', 'must', 'confess', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'mind', 'Lane', 'always', 'been', 'way', 'way', 'underutilized', 'Hollywood', 'always', 'shown', 'be', 'actress', 'highest', 'caliber', 'reason', 'not', 'always', 'been', 'granted', 'kinds', 'roles', 'ought', 'have', 'received', 'onscreen', 'film', 'very', 'nearly', 'entire', 'length', 'film', 'better', 'also', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'seemingly', 'accessible', 'way', 'really', 'loved', 'watching', 'marvelously', 'expressive', 'face', 'film.Although', 'film', 'really', 'mentioned', 'seem', 'sometimes', 'succession', 'postcards', 'pictures', 'Tuscan', 'calendar', 'question', 'film', 'surreally', 'beautiful', 'town', 'Cartona', 'so', 'exquisite', 'one', 'immediately', 'seized', 'dreams', 'winning', 'lottery', 'moving', 'therewith', 'quite', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'love', 'live', 'such', 'marvelous', 'place', 'brief', 'scenes', 'Positano', 'make', 'look', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'beautiful', 'spot', 'Cartona', 'question', 'very', 'gorgeous', 'movie', 'look', 'perhaps', 'tad', 'too', 'perfect', 'One', 'wonder', 'were', 'imperfections', 'region', 'camera', 'chose', 'ignore', 'matter', 'fantasy', 'beauty', 'was', 'quite', 'appropriate', 'mood', 'film.The', 'villa', 'purchases', 'more', 'less', 'becomes', 'one', 'major', 'characters', 'film', 'lovely', 'thing', 'bit', 'dilapidated', 'beginning', 'end', 'film', 'transformed', 'something', 'cared', 'caring', 'return', 'prospect', 'villa', 'breathtaking', 'gently', 'rolling', 'hills', 'filling', 'most', 'view', 'mountains', 'distant', 'bedroom', 'definitely', 'room', 'view', 'played', 'great', 'advantage', 'remarkable', 'scene', 'were', 'lightening', 'storm', 'ravage', 'area', 'lightening', 'bolt', 'striking', 'washing', 'machine', 'front', 'yard', 'owl', 'flying', 'bedroom', 'escape', 'chaos', 'outside.Finally', 'enjoyed', 'collection', 'friends', 'such', 'became', 'end', 'Tuscany', 'Frances', 'there', 'stranger', 'end', 'film', 'large', 'wide-ranging', 'group', 'friends', 'One', 'like', 'know', 'feel', 'affection', 'Frances', 'feels.This', 'not', 'one', 'great', 'films', 'one', 'likely', 'see', 'year', 'other', 'warm', 'likable', 'beautiful', 'film', 'hard', 'imagine', 'many', 'not', 'giving', 'charms']",N/A

She finds out the hard way that her husband is having an affair and gets a divorce, although she ends up losing her house to her ex (he 'pays' her for about half of it), so she decides to follow a friend Patti's advice (Oh) and travel to Tuscany. While visiting the little town of Cortona, Frances has a &quot;terrible idea&quot; and decides to buy a Villa.The Villa needs a lot of repairs and Francesca (as the locals start calling her) hires a band of misfit Polish workers. As time passes and work on her Villa goes on, Frances' life changes completely. She gets absorbed by the &quot;Italian&quot; way of life - not worrying so much about everything, enjoying life and not lingering on sad memories.This is a fine romantic comedy. Perhaps one of the best of the last couple of years. It's a shame that it wasn't noticed by more people (it's box office was barely over 43MM). Diane Lane shines in her role and Sandra Oh is really funny in the few moments she gets (she is the scene stealer of the film). The rest of the characters are perfectly cast with what I'm assuming to be European actors.But the one thing that makes this movie worth watching (I could go so far as to say owning, but nah!) are the gorgeous Tuscan landscapes. The beautiful little towns, the fabulous Villas, the pebble paved streets, the beautiful flower covered fields. There's also the little town by the sea where Marcello (Frances' love interest) lives. Unfortunately I didn't catch the name, otherwise I'd be taking a plane there right this moment. Keep an eye of cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson (Shine, Little women), because he shot a gorgeous looking movie.The only downside I found is that there's a couple of scenes in which the movies turns to magical realism.

786938,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0000VD02Y,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 2]","Though officially based on a true story - the autobiographical bestseller by Frances Mayes - ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" plays like one of those slick fiction ""women's pictures"" (now called ""chick flicks"") from the 1950's and 1960's in which a beautiful woman (usually played by Lana Turner or Jean Seberg), unlucky in the ways of love, heads to Europe in the hopes of finding true romance in the arms of the heavily-accented man of her dreams.This glossy, shallow and superficial soap opera stars Diane Lane as Frances, a semi-successful writer who discovers that her husband is cheating on her with another woman.  After the divorce, in which somehow the husband has managed to finagle almost everything including the house away from her as part of the settlement, Frances agrees to go on a gay bus tour through Italy that two lesbian friends have set up for her.  While on a stopover in Tuscany, the usually far-from-impulsive Frances decides, on the spur of the moment, to purchase a villa replete with bad plumbing and acres upon acres of olive trees.  Without any discernible source of income to make it all possible, Frances divides her time between making major repairs on the place and cavorting all over the Italian countryside, having ""adventures"" with the colorful native and immigrant population and falling under the spell of the handsome young Italian who always seems to be just waiting in the wings in stories such as these. But is he really the right man for her?  Needless to say, with all this going on, we don't see this ""author"" getting a whole lot of writing done during this overseas sojourn (though, at the end, we find that she`s somehow managed - apparently off-camera - to write a whole book about her experiences here).Diane Lane is so fine an actress that she is able to make even this hokey pablum almost believable at times.  For the most part, though, the film is a case of missed opportunities.  For instance, nothing whatsoever is done with the gay tour aspect of the plot (one suspects that the film might have been more interesting had Frances STAYED on the bus rather than gotten off, as I`m sure a group of gay guys would have known how to have more fun in Italy than she does), and Frances' own story winds up taking a back seat to a bland Romeo and Juliet-type subplot and a whole host of stereotypical minor characters.  Every time Lane begins to bring some depth and reality to her character, the romantic fantasy trappings pile on to overwhelm her.Apart from Lane's performance and the eye-popping views of the Italian landscape, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" offers little for the non-armchair traveler to feast on.",2,cloudy skies over Italy,1107216000,"02 1, 2005",2005,2648,"['Though', 'officially', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'autobiographical', 'bestseller', 'Frances', 'Mayes', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'one', 'slick', 'fiction', 'women', 'pictures', 'now', 'called', 'chick', 'flicks', '1950', '1960', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'usually', 'played', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'Jean', 'Seberg', 'unlucky', 'ways', 'love', 'heads', 'Europe', 'hopes', 'finding', 'true', 'romance', 'arms', 'heavily-accented', 'man', 'dreams.This', 'glossy', 'shallow', 'superficial', 'soap', 'opera', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Frances', 'semi-successful', 'writer', 'who', 'husband', 'cheating', 'woman', 'divorce', 'somehow', 'husband', 'managed', 'finagle', 'almost', 'everything', 'including', 'house', 'away', 'part', 'settlement', 'Frances', 'go', 'gay', 'bus', 'tour', 'Italy', 'two', 'lesbian', 'friends', 'have', 'set', 'up', 'stopover', 'Tuscany', 'usually', 'far-from-impulsive', 'Frances', 'spur', 'moment', 'purchase', 'villa', 'replete', 'bad', 'plumbing', 'upon', 'acres', 'olive', 'trees', 'discernible', 'source', 'income', 'make', 'possible', 'Frances', 'time', 'making', 'major', 'repairs', 'place', 'cavorting', 'Italian', 'countryside', 'having', 'adventures', 'colorful', 'native', 'immigrant', 'population', 'falling', 'spell', 'handsome', 'young', 'Italian', 'who', 'always', 'be', 'just', 'waiting', 'wings', 'stories', 'such', 'really', 'right', 'man', 'Needless', 'say', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'author', 'getting', 'whole', 'lot', 'writing', 'done', 'overseas', 'sojourn', 'end', 'find', 's', 'somehow', 'managed', 'apparently', 'off-camera', 'write', 'whole', 'book', 'experiences', 'here', '.Diane', 'Lane', 'so', 'fine', 'actress', 'able', 'make', 'even', 'hokey', 'almost', 'believable', 'times', 'most', 'part', 'though', 'film', 'case', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'instance', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'done', 'gay', 'tour', 'aspect', 'plot', 'one', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'had', 'Frances', 'STAYED', 'bus', 'rather', 'gotten', 'off', 'm', 'sure', 'group', 'gay', 'guys', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'how', 'have', 'more', 'fun', 'Italy', 'Frances', 'own', 'story', 'up', 'taking', 'back', 'seat', 'bland', 'Romeo', 'Juliet-type', 'subplot', 'whole', 'host', 'stereotypical', 'minor', 'characters', 'time', 'Lane', 'bring', 'depth', 'reality', 'character', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'trappings', 'pile', 'overwhelm', 'her.Apart', 'Lane', 'performance', 'eye-popping', 'views', 'Italian', 'landscape', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'little', 'non-armchair', 'traveler', 'feast']",N/A

786940,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B0000VD02Y,Samuel McKewon,"[77, 198]","Suffering a rank case of postmodern personality disorder - dead split between traditional and avant-garde mores - ""Under The Tuscan Sun"" seeks to embrace its main character, a divorced writer reinventing her life along with a villa in the Italian hills, and then poke fun at her, doling out equal amounts of ladybugs and Fellini. It plays a basic genre con, pretending to be a Travel Picture while its main trade is the same movie-of-the-week dramatics Lisa Hartman has been gnashing her teeth over for years.Diane Lane, in an apology for her brave, sexy performance in ""Unfaithful,"" is Frances Mayes, jilted and unmoored on a gay tour of Italy (set up by her gay friend, played by Sandra Oh) while writing esteemed lines on postcards such as ""ding, dang, dong, the bell rang"" and stumbling upon a house and garden ripe for remodeling, and her entire bank account.Writer/director Audrey Wells doesn't particularly consider this villa with her camera; we get glimpses of rooms, a concept of the garden, but Lane never presented in anything but regal close-up. There are obligatory, Remember-It's-Tuscany helicopter shots, but the movie's two most impressive visuals - a sunset on the beach and Florence at dawn - are special f/x, blue screen manipulations. Shameless.But Wells isn't out for an American version of ""Enchanted April."" She is, however, offering the full tour of women's issues: divorce (in her book by the same name, Mayes refurbishes the villa with her husband), pregnancy, forbidden young love, sex, kind married men, swarthy younger men, silent older men who leave flowers at alters for no apparent reason, and finally, famous movie directors, say Federico Fellini, who apparently thought a great deal of all things child - enthusiasm, innocence, naivete, stupidity. Fellini is dead, but his wisdom is channeled through a goofy blonde bombshell who poses nude for a painting one afternoon while drinking tea with nuns the next morning.There are dreams about white dresses, mewling kitties (did Wells mistake Fellini for Luis Bunuel?) flag-tossing expeditions, days in the olive fields, thunderstorms, snakes, signs from God via pigeons and a motorcycle ride through a seaside resort. The motorcycle ride, featuring Lane done up to the nines, is a particularly odd scene, considering the joke laid at Frances' feet by the end of that ride.But ""Under The Tuscan Sun"" is full of such contrasts, vesting in Frances' want to have and find love, then exposing the quest as fraud, as if to be a grind of feminist theory Frances must survive before passing out the other side and meeting a servile, unworthy guy in the movie's final five minutes - literally - as if that God of thunderstorms and ladybugs sent him through Tuscany as reward.Lane is appealing and gorgeous but she mugs as badly as Meg Ryan on Theatre Sunday; her face pops and seethes and scowls and explodes in happiness and, quite often, settles on a bizarre, quizzical frown unbecoming of a woman in her late thirties, who should have figured a few things out by now. Frances is written as vulnerable, and Lane hits that mark with an obviousness that's meant to be funny; at times it works, at others Lane just shambles around. Yes, she's capable enough of opening and carrying a movie, if that was the point, but Lane need not play a half-witted fourth fiddle in Julia Roberts country just to avoid the tagalong role in Keanu Reeves sports films.For Wells, who had wrote ""The Truth About Cats and Dogs"" and ""Guinevere,"" the failure is not surprising: Frankly, she's skilled in relationship territory, hapless otherwise. ""Under The Tuscan Sun"" mines the same ridiculous ""in a foreign land, everyone's a kook!"" material beaten to pulp - in fact, Europeans are not half as juiced up and loud as Americans - while teaching its lesson on What Women Should Want.Bizarre, right-angled stuff like recreating the fountain scene from Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"" speaks to Wells' arrogance and true aim - only a small portion of the audience, and hardly anyone under forty, will have the foggiest idea what that scene is, or was, about.

Just when you think it's about to fall into the standard formula, it makes a quick left turn. It actually has a lot of truth in it. Anyone, male or female, who has been through a divorce and all that goes along with it emotionally can relate to it. Only a few, though, will find the courage (and proper encouragement) to not allow it to define the rest of their lives.

786948,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B0000VD02Y,Scott Schiefelbein,"[4, 4]","The one thing everyone must say about Audrey Wells' ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is that it is visually stunning.  Restraint is completely abandoned in this Oprah-ready tale of a beautiful divorcee (Diane Lane) ""finding herself"" in the postcard-perfect Tuscan hillside.  Yes, this is a movie for those who sprinkle extra sugar on their cotton candy.This is the kind of movie that won't give you a gorgeous shot of an old church -- rather, we'll give you a gorgeous shot of an old church on a picturesque Tuscan hillside as the camera peeks over a bank of photogenic sunflowers in full bloom.  Not content to show the gorgeous Diane Lane exchanging sweet nothings with a gorgeous Italian hunk on a gorgeous Italian beach, Ms. Wells feels obliged to throw a kitten -- yes, a freaking kitten -- into the scene for no reason other than to send the cuteness scale over the top.Ms. Lane stars in this ode to returning to basics - it is revealing that noboby I've talked to about the movie knows her character's name.  In a plot device straight out of a gripe session on ""The View,"" Ms. Lane gets divorced by her philandering husband -- and thanks to California's heartless divorce laws, she ends up living in the divorcee's flat while he keeps the posh San Francisco house.  Massive depression ensues, as evidenced by Ms. Lane's furrowed brow.  Let's just say that the stellar acting job Diane Lane gave us in ""Unfaithful"" is nowhere to be found in ""Tuscan Sun.""Ms. Lane's stereotypically supportive lipstick lesbian friends try to buck up her spirits by sending her on a trip to Tuscany -- but it's a gay trip, get it!  Actually, the gay tour offers one of the movie's few genuine laughs with its appellation, ""Gay and Away!""  Diane spots a ""for sale"" sign on a picturesque Tuscan villa and, after some hapless negotiating and some timely bird crap, she buys it.We then enter a long series of scenes as Diane begins to restore the villa -- for those of you who were perhaps wondering if there would be a delightful parallel between the rehabilitation of the villa and Ms. Lane's personal rehabilitation, you won't be surprised.  Again, the movie ain't subtle.  Employing a trio of lovable Polish cardboard cutouts as laborers, Diane returns ""Bramasole"" to its villa-ish glory.  Naturally, after living in Tuscany for a few weeks, Ms. Lane discovers that she has already mastered Tuscan cuisine, and the movie gives us several shots of her presenting her friends and laborers with meals that could be on the cover of a Tuscan cookbook.  Unfortunately, ""Tuscan Sun"" is not that interested in food beyond its photogenics -- those looking for another ""Big Night"" will be horribly disappointed.Of course, Ms. Lane must find her self romantically involved.  To say this aspect of the story is handled poorly is an understatement. Her realtor achieves a cinematic first -- he offers to sleep with Diane while simultaneously confirming his devotion to his wife.  And just about when the audience is expecting Diane to find herself a man, lo and behold she runs into a charming soul who looks like a champion Italian tennis player.Several other sub-plots are handled in similarly skin-deep fashion.  This is the kind of movie that doesn't interject a serious love interest for Ms. Lane until the last five minutes, and he really only gets about two or three lines of dialogue . . . but visually the movie tells you that he is the one to complete our heroine.All in all, ""Tuscan Sun"" is an inoffensive, light-hearted, beautiful romp through nonsense.  To borrow a Shakespearean title, ""Much Ado About Nothing"" completely fits.  That being said, the movie can play a role if you find yourself completely depressed (or lacking in travel plans) -- Tuscany is a wonderful tonic.

This film depends on the performance of Diane Lane (as Mayes), who, even though she can manage to look stunning in a ratty t-shirt, still comes off as down to earth and approachable, someone who seems to be inviting you into her life. That's what she does in this film. After she discovers her husband is cheating on her, Frances (Lane) falters but then accepts a ticket to Tuscany from one of her gay friends. Admittedly, the trajectory from there is predicatable--she rennovates a Tuscan villa while at the same time rennovating her life, which includes meeting a new man. But the film is more about Frances' self-discovery, experiencing life, and getting her own inner life back on track.

Her performance as a crestfallen divorcee American writer is a disappointing, she twitched and grimaced like a female Hugh Grant, using delayed reaction goggle-eyes instead of emotion.Needless scenes abound. The self-grabbing congratulatory dance she did in her bedroom after scoring with her young stud was just plain agonizing to watch. Another awful scene was when Patti came back pregnant and abandoned and lay in the bed crying. Diane Lane's face was vacant, with a fake little soap opera frown of concern on her brow and a simpering smile on her mouth. Awful, and inexcusable of the director to leave that shot in.Italian stereotypes? Truckloads:(1) Crazy old contessa who takes bird poop on the forehead of a stranger as a sign to sell her the prized villa. Okay, whatever, even though she would have gotten more money from the German couple who had first dibs.(2) Suave love-em and leave-em Romeos? All over the place. Even a romantic stud who says things like &quot;Your eyes are beautiful. I would love to swim in them&quot;.(3) Simple, good-hearted locals happy to pick your olives for you? A villageful.(4) An inane young couple whose parents don't consent to their idiotic relationship? Yes, and our American sweetheart swerves their mind in less than 5 minutes.(5) People falling from trees in the backyard. Yep.(6) Three Italian construction workers who worked for 8-9 months for almost nothing while maintaining a wonderful attitude all the time? Hmm.Whether all of this Hollywood view of countryside Italy suits your gullible palate or not, all of this is just too drawn out to retain a viewer's attention.To add a final dollop of fuel to the fire, after all these ordeals, our poor Ms. Frances ends up with a goofy-looking failed American writer anyway.

786965,A14OB7YKMPBJLW,B0000VD02Y,Susan Fong,"[2, 3]","""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is a rare commodity in films today- a thoughtful, mature, and elegant romantic comedy which is tastefully written and exquisitely performed.  The profusion of obscenities and graphic sexual exploits found in most recent ""comedies"" thankfully are absent in this splendid movie.This movie is rich with gentle humor and accurate insight into the human condition.  We have all experienced joy and sadness, loneliness, and the yearning to be loved and accepted by others.  The central character, played by Diane Lane, is an intelligent and attractive thirtyish writer who has suffered a heartbreaking divorce.  She decides to make a fresh start and relocates from the U.S. to the lush countryside of Tuscan, Italy.  She buys a dilapidated villa and plans to have it renovated as her new home.As the villa is transformed by a construction crew of rather eccentric Polish immigrants, Lane's character also undergoes changes. She becomes more of a risk-taker and forces herself out of her comfort zone so she can meet and mingle with the locals while absorbing their language and customs along the way.  She learns more about herself in the process.Our heroine's spirits get a major boost when her best friend (drolly represented by Sandra Oh) comes to live with her in the villa.  The best friend is pregnant, and she has been deserted by her female lover.  Lane's character and Oh's character find strength and comfort from their long friendship.  They understand each other even if nothing has been said.  They have a special bond.There are so many delights in ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" not the least of which is the bright ensemble of actors with Diane Lane's textured, sympathetic performance especially memorable.  She makes you really care about this decent and kind wounded soul who is trying so hard to move on with her life after the trauma of divorce from a seemingly happy marriage.Too many movies today are mindless, exploitative trash.  A movie like ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is a reminder that there are a few talented, conscientious artists still around who are able to create movies that are intelligent and have a heart.

Freaky Friday, A Year in Provence (a TV miniseries), and now Under the Tuscan Sun.Under the Tuscan Sun is not a great movie, but it is pleasant and fun to watch. The book was pleasant as well, but Frances Mayes, the author of the book, did not seem like an easy person to know and came across as a bit of a snob. She was almost insufferable in her sequel book, Bella Tuscany.Diane Lane, as Frances Mayes in the movie, plays a different and more likeable character. In fact, about the only thing that is the same in the movie as in the book is that the house is called Bramasole and is in Tuscany.The Tuscan and San Francisco scenery is beautiful, Frances's Italian boyfriend is gorgeous (those lips!), and the plots weave their way to a happy, if unlikely, ending.Much of the story doesn't stand up well to scrutiny, but this isn't the sort of movie you really analyze too closely. Otherwise the eccentric character played by Lindsay Duncan, the spur-of-the-moment purchase of a Tuscan villa, and even the kitten on the beach, would all seem more than a little contrived.So enjoy this movie for what it is: a chick flick, date movie, or a bit of fluffy escapism to see once.",3,Better Than the Book,1077580800,"02 24, 2004",2004,1335,"['years', 'assuming', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'book', 'based', 'have', 'come', 'run', 'movies', 'are', 'real', 'improvement', 'books', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'Year', 'Provence', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'now', 'Tuscan', 'Sun.Under', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'pleasant', 'fun', 'watch', 'book', 'was', 'pleasant', 'well', 'Frances', 'Mayes', 'author', 'book', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'easy', 'person', 'know', 'came', 'bit', 'snob', 'was', 'almost', 'insufferable', 'sequel', 'book', 'Bella', 'Tuscany.Diane', 'Lane', 'Frances', 'Mayes', 'movie', 'different', 'more', 'likeable', 'character', 'fact', 'only', 'thing', 'same', 'movie', 'book', 'house', 'called', 'Bramasole', 'Tuscany.The', 'Tuscan', 'San', 'Francisco', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'Frances', 'Italian', 'boyfriend', 'gorgeous', 'lips', 'plots', 'weave', 'way', 'happy', 'unlikely', 'ending.Much', 'story', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'well', 'scrutiny', ""n't"", 'sort', 'movie', 'really', 'analyze', 'too', 'closely', 'Otherwise', 'eccentric', 'character', 'played', 'Lindsay', 'Duncan', 'spur-of-the-moment', 'purchase', 'Tuscan', 'villa', 'even', 'kitten', 'beach', 'would', 'seem', 'more', 'little', 'contrived.So', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'what', 'chick', 'flick', 'date', 'movie', 'bit', 'fluffy', 'escapism', 'see', 'once']",N/A

I picked it out as a movie for my girlfriend and I to watch, since I had heard good things about it several years ago. This IS a chick-flick type of movie, but it definitely does not follow the same VERY tired romantic-comedy formula script that Hollywood loves to crank out. Yes, I suppose Under The Tuscan Sun is a romantic comedy, but it is a GOOD one, and it is  fairly original in its approach.First, I should say the beautiful Diane Lane is a really great actress, and plays her part perfectly here. You truly believe in her character, which really adds to the believability of the film (suspension of disbelief is important to enjoying a movie). Most of the supporting cast does an excellent job as well (with the slight exception of ""Stone Face"" Sandra Oh, her face always seems devoid of emotion to me). Probably the most important member of the supporting cast is the SCENERY. The landscapes showcased in this movie are gorgeous and pretty astonishing. The excellent cinematography takes full advantage of the beautiful scenery Italy provides, and the movie is all the better for it.While the film is not outright original per se, it does take a rather fresh approach to romantic comedy, and you won't be able to predict what is going to happen far in advance (when's the last time you could say that about a romantic comedy??). The script is very good, with quite a few laughs and excellent pacing, and the dialogue is sharp. All in all, a VERY GOOD movie that both men and women can enjoy.A couple of other things: apparently, the film radically departs from the novel. I didn't read the book (and have no intention of doing so). You won't need to read the book to enjoy this movie. Also, I read a few gripes about Diane Lane not being 'beautiful' because she is 'old'. A matter of opinion I guess, but to me she looks fantastic in this movie at 38... and  she really IS a great actress.Under The Tuscan Sun is RECOMMENDED for anyone looking for a 'couples' movie that both will enjoy (but Macho He-Men shouldn't bother, you only like Rambo type movies).",4,"Is this a ""chick-flick"" if I liked it?

A thought that remained with me throughout the viewing. I apologize for being such a material girl but the lovely house does make you wonder. We are talking not only about the house itself whose price we understand how Frances Mayes afforded, but the everyday life who do cost a little money especially if you redo your house with such lovely furniture. It seems that Frances Mayes was very busy during the daytime (the meals she cooked seem to have taken hours to make), and only spent a few hours writing. Was that enough to afford life in Italy? I wonder. The house itself needed intense furnishing which no doubt cost money too... I assume these thoughts come to the mind of anyone watching this movie and asking himself ""why not me""? well money seems to be one of the answers.However, casting these thoughts aside, this is indeed a movie that is a pleasure to watch, even if the storyline is a little banale and not totally credible. Indeed, the book by the same name is more detailed (and thus tedious) explaining how the long renovations came through. One picture however is worth a thousand words and watching the beautiful Italy is not like reading about it in a book.Diane Lane is lovely and beautiful and is a joy to watch. Her acting abilities (which were amazing in ""Unfaithful"") do not have a lot of ""meat"" besides several emotional outbreaks (usually over romantic issues) but she is warm and touching.

If you still want to find another reason to see it, that's Diane Lane, whose delightful acting as American writer 'Frances' deserves every praise bestowed on this light-weight film.Again I say, the plot is very slim, too slim to hold the weight of the nearly 2 hour film.  Frances, newly divorced, buys an old house in a small villa in Tuscany, in which she finds s new way of life, or new way of looking at that.So, she finds a new love in hunky Italian Marcello (Raoul Rova); she finds a new family in the kind-hearted neighbors; she even helps an Italian girl and a Polish boy vow the eternal love (which, ironically she finds, is hard to find).  Everything is put in a right place; only that in the fashion of popular romance (and the film is based on the book of the same title by 'Frances' Mayes ... see that?).In fact there is nothing wrong with the film, except that it was done with many cliched techniques -- broken house which represents life, the best friend (Sandra Oh) who is lesbian, and all the Italian boys who never misses the chance to whisper the words of love to the girls.  If you are likeky to be irritated with these unoriginality, stay away from 'Tuscan Sun.'  As for me, I just pretended that I didn't see them at all.But Dinae Lane.  She is so delightful that you may (just 'may') forgive and forget any cloying emotions or banal characters.  She even jumps around on the bed, wearing only black underwear, just like Brittney Spears did in 'Crossrards.'

786974,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B0000VD02Y,Tucker Andersen,"[35, 60]","The concept that formed the basis of Frances Mayes' acclaimed memoir UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN has been used as a starting point for the development of the storyline for this film. However, this movie is a wonderful illustration of the difficulties of fashioning a film with wide box office appeal from a fascinating book with a devoted but limited audience. I have not read the book but apparently its lyrical and captivating descriptions of Frances' experiences in purchasing and renovating Bramasole, a rundown Italian villa, and of her enjoyment of life in the Italian countryside led the producers to want to capture those experiences on film. However, they decided that they needed more of a story in order to engage the audience, and settled on a backdrop of failed romance contrasted with the enthusiasm of young love as a means of keeping the audience engaged for this almost two hour film. The result is an enjoyable story, some wonderful scenery, several funny lines and incidents but no truly uproarious comedy, a marvelous performance by Diane Lane, but also a relatively formulaic story that never veers too far from the predictable. Yet while attempting to provide feelgood endings for all the various threads of the story, it does fail however to answer the mystery regarding the old man with flowers.The movie casts Frances as a frustrated writer whose professional existence is as a book reviewer, and this persona is important to the storyline  both at the start and also at the contrived conclusion of the film. She becomes despondent when she learns that her husband is having an affair and wants a divorce, and this film traces her progress through the various stages of her emotional journey. It then utilizes the technique of her deciding to live in and renovate an Italian villa which she stumbles upon during a trip to Italy (arranged by her concerned friends) as the source of her eventual catharsis and reaffirmation of life. Her best friend Patti (Sandra Oh) unexpectedly joins Frances in Italy during Patti's final stages of pregnancy when she is deserted by her lesbian lover, and there are romantic episodes involving Frances which provide counterpoint to the budding romance between a young man who is a member of the Polish crew renovating her new home and the daughter of the neighboring Italian family. Finally, there is Katherine (Lindsay Duncan) an intriguing Englishwoman who settled in Italy years ago following a teenage encounter with FE FE (known to the rest of us as Frederico Fellini) that left an indelible impression on her life.While all this is enjoyable, due to the fact that the plot was grafted onto a very different type of book the movie simply wanders towards its eventual conclusion without any real suspense or passion. While I am sure that many filmgoers will differ, I would have it preferred that it contain either more realism or at the other extreme be a much more straightforward character study with some elements of suspense, unfortunately we got neither. (Personally, I had hoped for an Italian version of  THIS OLD TUSCAN HOUSE with a Bob Vila equivalent giving some serious insights into such a project intertwined with a believable storyline.) Instead, the renovation project itself was used mostly to generate laughs. Thus, despite the film being well made and enjoyable, I cannot rate it more than three stars since I have no desire to either watch it again in the immediate future or to own the DVD. However, when you want light entertainment, and especially if you are a Diane Lane fan or want to see a performance by an actress who gets the most out of her material, you should see this film.

786980,ASJ89T42CIUHU,B0000VD02Y,V. Marshall,"[13, 17]","I read Frances Mayes's book ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" before watching this film and gladly so. While the film took a different road than the book they both wound up smack dab in the middle of beautiful Tuscany each with its own brilliance.This film was adapted from an original memoir by writer/teacher Frances Mayes as she undertook the renovation of a Tuscan villa. The book is actually quite different than the story in the film but both are wonderful. Diane Lane stars as Frances and the story begins with divorce and the loss of love but it evolves into a sensual journey into Tuscany and ends with genuine love. Lane discovers herself while on a much needed vacation to Italy. She stumbles across a few signs that lead her to buy a beautiful, although run-down, Tuscan villa. This is where the real story begins filled with extraordinary shots of the beauty that can only be found in Tuscany and a brief examination of what makes life in Tuscany so amazing. Lane hires four workers, one Italian and three Polish, to renovate her treasured villa. Along the way walls fall down in clouds of billowing smoke, water boils where it shouldn't, thunder storms create havoc for humans and owls, olive trees begin to bear fruit, and relationships begin to form from a great supporting cast.This movie about a lost woman found is a true inspiration. Lane is excellent as the middle aged woman who loses her sense of self and discovers she never lost it after all. The movie is about life and love, beauty and new discoveries but mostly it is about family, that richness that gives us life, whether our own or one we pluck from available sources. The scenes are filled with the beauty of Italy, flowers in bloom, wine and food prepared with love and great effort is paid to the scenic views of such a rich country. Be prepared to look for signs of your own after watching this film, craving a table full of food with a family to sit down and enjoy it with and you may even find yourself booking the next flight to Tuscany for some villa shopping of your own under the glorious Tuscan sun of course.",5,The Sunlight Filled My Heart,1094169600,"09 3, 2004",2004,2090,"['read', 'Frances', 'Mayes', 'book', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'watching', 'film', 'gladly', 'so', 'film', 'took', 'different', 'road', 'book', 'wound', 'up', 'smack', 'dab', 'middle', 'beautiful', 'Tuscany', 'own', 'brilliance.This', 'film', 'was', 'adapted', 'original', 'memoir', 'writer/teacher', 'Frances', 'Mayes', 'undertook', 'renovation', 'Tuscan', 'villa', 'book', 'actually', 'quite', 'different', 'story', 'film', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'stars', 'Frances', 'story', 'divorce', 'loss', 'love', 'sensual', 'journey', 'Tuscany', 'genuine', 'love', 'Lane', 'discovers', 'much', 'needed', 'vacation', 'Italy', 'few', 'signs', 'lead', 'buy', 'beautiful', 'run-down', 'Tuscan', 'villa', 'where', 'real', 'story', 'filled', 'extraordinary', 'shots', 'beauty', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'found', 'Tuscany', 'brief', 'examination', 'what', 'life', 'Tuscany', 'so', 'amazing', 'Lane', 'four', 'workers', 'one', 'Italian', 'three', 'Polish', 'renovate', 'treasured', 'villa', 'way', 'fall', 'down', 'clouds', 'billowing', 'smoke', 'water', 'boils', 'where', 'should', ""n't"", 'thunder', 'storms', 'create', 'havoc', 'humans', 'owls', 'olive', 'trees', 'begin', 'bear', 'fruit', 'relationships', 'begin', 'form', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast.This', 'movie', 'lost', 'woman', 'found', 'true', 'inspiration', 'Lane', 'excellent', 'middle', 'aged', 'woman', 'who', 'sense', 'self', 'discovers', 'never', 'lost', 'movie', 'life', 'love', 'beauty', 'new', 'discoveries', 'mostly', 'family', 'life', 'own', 'one', 'pluck', 'available', 'sources', 'scenes', 'are', 'filled', 'beauty', 'Italy', 'flowers', 'bloom', 'wine', 'food', 'prepared', 'love', 'great', 'effort', 'paid', 'scenic', 'views', 'such', 'rich', 'country', 'Be', 'prepared', 'look', 'signs', 'own', 'watching', 'film', 'craving', 'table', 'full', 'food', 'family', 'sit', 'down', 'enjoy', 'may', 'even', 'find', 'booking', 'next', 'flight', 'Tuscany', 'villa', 'shopping', 'own', 'glorious', 'Tuscan', 'sun', 'course']",N/A

786982,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0000VD02Y,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[4, 7]","&quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot; is at turns a delightful and sad romantic comedy romp full of a number of clever and unexpected twists and turns. San Francisco writer Frances Mayes ( Diane Lane) discovers her husband's affair and the discovery shatters her life. When he seeks alimony, she's forced to sell him the house that they renovated together with her mother's money. At first she takes residence in an apartment building where it seems everyone is lamenting a lost love or smarting over a divorce. As the first anniversary of her &quot;freedom&quot; looms, a lesbian friend takes her out to dinner and makes her an offer she can't refuse. She gives Frances a ticket to Italy. Frances is afraid of finding new romance. It's not something she's likely to do on the trip however as the tour is for gays and lesbians and her friend is unable to go because she's pregnant.While out and about on her own, she sees  a picture of a villa for sale. On the spur of the moment she decides to purchase it. She wants to radically reshape her life and sees this as the opportunity to do so.  With the blessing of pigeon poop on her head (evidently a &quot;sign&quot; to the elderly owner that she deserves the old and crumbling villa), Frances earns the right to purchase the place. What ensues is beautiful scenery, a series of comedic and sad  events as she remodels her new villa culminating in an unexpected second chance at romance.Based on Frances Mayes' best-selling book, Audrey Wells has fashioned a memorable and unpredictable romantic comedy about second chances. If you're a fan of Mayes' book you may be disappointed. The basic premise is similar but, beyond that, the film has little to do with Mayes book. My advice, get it over it and enjoy the movie for what it is not what it isn't.Filled with memorable character actors from Italy, American and the UK, &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot; eschews the typical formula seen in Nora Epstein's movies in favor of a series of unpredictable and interesting plot twists. Diane Lane gives a marvelous performance as Frances Mayes (which I should note is a fictionalized version of the author as the book has little to do with the novel beyond the setting and basic premises) a soul who has lost her way in the bitter aftermath of divorce. The renewal she finds with the renovation of her new villa and friendships she establishes along the way makes for a rewarding and touching film experience.The widescreen anamorphic transfer looks lovely capturing all the crisp, bright colors of Italy. There's no analog artifacts whatsoever and virtually no edge enhancement problems. &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot; has been lovingly transferred from film to video without any of the usual analog to digital problems. The sound mix is as warm and sunny as the Italian landscape. While the 5.1 sound isn't used as successfully as say, an action picture, there's plenty of subtle detail to be heard and appreciated. The feeling of Italy envelops the listener with this carefully prepared transfer.There are the usual deleted scenes, some of which add a bit of additional character touches. The making of featurette &quot;Tuscany 101&quot; provides a nice glimpse into the production and thought process of the writer/director Audrey Wells and her star. There are also cast and filmmaker interviews and a glimpse into some of the challenges and rewards of shooting in Italy.Writer/director Audrey Wells provides an insightful and informative commentary track. It's a pity that Diane Lane and some of the Italian actors weren't included in the process. It would have been very interesting to get the Italian actors take on an American romantic comedy.A delightful and touching film, &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot; will provide an evening of great entertainment. Diane Lane is, as usual, marvelous in the lead performance. Great care has been taken to preserve the look of the film and the transfer is truly spectacular looking.",4,"Sweet, charming movie about transitions and second chances",1076198400,"02 8, 2004",2004,3970,"['quot', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'quot', 'turns', 'delightful', 'sad', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'romp', 'full', 'number', 'clever', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'turns', 'San', 'Francisco', 'writer', 'Frances', 'Mayes', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'husband', 'affair', 'discovery', 'life', 'When', 'alimony', 'forced', 'sell', 'house', 'renovated', 'together', 'mother', 'money', 'first', 'residence', 'apartment', 'building', 'where', 'everyone', 'lamenting', 'lost', 'love', 'smarting', 'divorce', 'first', 'anniversary', 'quot', 'freedom', 'quot', 'looms', 'lesbian', 'friend', 'out', 'dinner', 'offer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'Frances', 'ticket', 'Italy', 'Frances', 'afraid', 'finding', 'new', 'romance', 'not', 'something', 'likely', 'do', 'trip', 'however', 'tour', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'friend', 'unable', 'go', 'pregnant.While', 'out', 'about', 'own', 'picture', 'villa', 'sale', 'spur', 'moment', 'purchase', 'radically', 'reshape', 'life', 'opportunity', 'do', 'so', 'blessing', 'pigeon', 'poop', 'head', 'evidently', 'quot', 'sign', 'quot', 'elderly', 'owner', 'old', 'crumbling', 'villa', 'Frances', 'right', 'purchase', 'place', 'What', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'series', 'comedic', 'sad', 'events', 'new', 'villa', 'culminating', 'unexpected', 'second', 'chance', 'romance.Based', 'Frances', 'Mayes', 'best-selling', 'book', 'Audrey', 'Wells', 'fashioned', 'memorable', 'unpredictable', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'second', 'chances', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Mayes', 'book', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'basic', 'premise', 'similar', 'film', 'little', 'do', 'Mayes', 'book', 'My', 'advice', 'get', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'what', 'not', 'what', ""isn't.Filled"", 'memorable', 'character', 'actors', 'Italy', 'American', 'UK', 'quot', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'quot', 'typical', 'formula', 'seen', 'Nora', 'Epstein', 'movies', 'favor', 'series', 'unpredictable', 'interesting', 'plot', 'twists', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'Frances', 'Mayes', 'should', 'note', 'fictionalized', 'version', 'author', 'book', 'little', 'do', 'novel', 'setting', 'basic', 'premises', 'soul', 'who', 'lost', 'way', 'bitter', 'aftermath', 'divorce', 'renewal', 'renovation', 'new', 'villa', 'way', 'rewarding', 'touching', 'film', 'experience.The', 'widescreen', 'anamorphic', 'transfer', 'lovely', 'capturing', 'crisp', 'bright', 'colors', 'Italy', 'analog', 'whatsoever', 'virtually', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'problems', 'quot', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'quot', 'been', 'lovingly', 'transferred', 'film', 'video', 'usual', 'analog', 'digital', 'problems', 'sound', 'mix', 'warm', 'sunny', 'Italian', 'landscape', '5.1', 'sound', ""n't"", 'used', 'as', 'successfully', 'say', 'action', 'picture', 'plenty', 'subtle', 'detail', 'be', 'heard', 'appreciated', 'feeling', 'Italy', 'listener', 'carefully', 'prepared', 'are', 'usual', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'add', 'bit', 'additional', 'character', 'touches', 'making', 'featurette', 'quot', 'Tuscany', '101', 'quot', 'nice', 'glimpse', 'production', 'thought', 'process', 'writer/director', 'Audrey', 'Wells', 'star', 'are', 'also', 'cast', 'filmmaker', 'interviews', 'glimpse', 'challenges', 'rewards', 'shooting', 'Italy.Writer/director', 'Audrey', 'Wells', 'insightful', 'informative', 'commentary', 'track', 'pity', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Italian', 'actors', 'were', ""n't"", 'included', 'process', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'interesting', 'get', 'Italian', 'actors', 'take', 'American', 'romantic', 'comedy.A', 'delightful', 'touching', 'film', 'quot', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'quot', 'will', 'provide', 'evening', 'great', 'entertainment', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'usual', 'marvelous', 'lead', 'performance', 'Great', 'care', 'been', 'taken', 'preserve', 'look', 'film', 'transfer', 'truly', 'spectacular', 'looking']",N/A

Some call this genre ""chick flicks""--so be it.The story is pure, simple fluff, and not even original at that. Diane Lane (perfect in the role) plays a scorned woman, not too young, but far from old, who purchases a broken-down villa in Tuscany, Italy, on pure whim. Does it make sense? No! Is it perfectly believable? Yes! As she sets out to save the villa from utter ruin and turn it into a liveable residence, she finds herself involved with a crazy group of Polish emigrants, who not only speak poor English, but poor Italian as well. They have been hired to remodel the villa.Then there's a crazy but fabulous real estate woman who fancies herself a character in a Fellini movie--and then some. Our heroine has definitely bitten off more than she can chew, but at least she doesn't have much time to think of the cad back home who dumped her.

Such is the case in Under the Tuscan Sun.  The story begins with San Francisco writer and book reviewer Lane reeling under the tragedy of divorce.Lane is provided with a free tour to Tuscany by a lesbian friend who bypasses the trip she purchased to give birth via in vitro fertilization.  Lane bolts the gay tour in beautiful Tuscany, where she experiences an epiphany.  She becomes enchanted and eventually buys an old house, with a reclamation project following, in the course of which she gets acquainted with the people and the area.Eventually Lane's lesbian friend turns up in Tuscany with a new baby after her gay relationship ends.  In addition to this adjustment, Lane finds herself awakening in the sexual realm.  An experience with a handsome young man from the area prompts her to see herself as never before.Lane's character arc in the film is significant as she sees herself in her new setting as never before.

I am not foreign to these, as I have a wife whom I dearly love, despite her taste in movies that could only be construed as ""questionable"".  I have seen a good many Jennifer Lopez movies, several starring women in the workplace who are Feisty and will Probably Fall In Love With The Wrong Guy.  However, no movie has insulted the intellect of its audience in quite so drastic a fashion as the movie which is Under The Tuscan Sun.Chick Flicks go through several different stages, depending on the target age of the audience watching them.  For example, movies about Ugly Pretty Girls who are somehow changed into Lovely Prom Queens while retaining their Artistic and Sensitive Personalities would be a Stage 1 Chick Flick.  As these same women progress into young adulthood, they tend towards movies with women who are Ad/TV Execs or News Columnists in big businesses in New York City.  These women are never anything but the greatest at what they do.  The women in these roles often have semi-wacky mishaps and either have a ""love interest"" male or witchy female competing with them for their jobs.  There will also be a less attractive friend, probably played by Jeneane Garofolo.These are Stage 2 Chick Flicks.Many hours later of watching Lifetime and countless Danielle Steele novels about empowered female lawyers Learning To Love Again, the watcher of the Chick Flick is likely now in her mid 20s to early 30s.  Their life has likely been a bitter disappointment on many fronts, and so they are prime targets for Stage 3 Chick Flicks.  Stage 3 Chick Flicks generally include women who have had Struggles yearning To Do Stuff, and eventually doing whatever it was they were yearning about in the first place.  And here we find Under The Tuscan Sun.The movie stars Diane Lane, who was also in Unfaithful, in which she has sex with someone other than Richard Gere.  I'm not sure what bearing this has on the review, but it was a far superior movie.  Diane's character's name is Frances.  She is from San Francisco, and therefore has lesbian friends.  I imagine she also enjoys Starbucks and votes Democratic, and every other assumption movies make today. We get it, we get it. Frances has  recently gone through her divorce (clearly not her fault, as this is a chick flick) and is pretty bummed about it.  Her gay friends (who are expecting a baby, of course)decide to give the gift of going on a Gay in Tuscany Tour.Once in Tuscany, Frances (or Francesca, we're in Italy now) decided to purchase a run-down villa.  Evidently, it is incredibly easy for Americans to simply purchase Italian villas and decide to stay in the country.  She is able to purchase the house because the old Italian lady sees a bird take a crap in the house.  Seriously.  Because. She. Sees. Bird. CRAP.Naturally, the house is a mess, and our journey of self-realization and feminine daydreaming is stopped in its tracks.  Egads!  The place is a mess!  Much like her tortured psyche!  And the roof leaks!  And the toilet doesn't work!  Ahhhh!  At this rate, never will she find self-reliance or the ability to love again!One of the lesbians (the pregnant one) comes to live with her because the other lesbian ran out on her.  Negligent parenting--it's not just for heteros anymore!  Of course, she is free to travel while 8 months pregnant to Italy and stay for as long as she likes.  ""Come on over!"" says Italy, ""Anything we can get for you?  Stay as long as you need to, you poor alternative-lifestyle pregnant lady!  You're everything an Italian villager would approve of!""There's also a story about some Polish workers, but I don't remember the particulars.  One of the guys was in love with a girl, and at some point threw some flags in the air to prove it.  Then again, this entire movie was throwing up red flags, so my memory lapse is understandable.We also learn that Italian men have a zest for life, and this zest manifests itself into what can only be called ""stalking women in public"".  Evidently, ""la dolce vita"" includes the need for restraining orders.Finally, the allegorical story of Frances' heart--I mean the house--is starting to come together, so she starts to fall in love with an Italian man who says things like ""I drown in your eyes"".  He also drives a scooter, which just goes to show this guy is HARDCORE.Naturally, the guy ends up cheating on her.  But that's ok, because she's learned to love herself, you see, and the once standoffish Italian neighbors now bring her veggies from their garden and say ""Buona Sera!"" to her each radiant Tuscan morning, and the vineyard (quoty fingers ""Frances' soul"")is bearing fruit.  Also, her lesbian friend gives birth, seemingly unphased about doing so in the middle of rural Italy. I'm betting she didn't even transfer her Ob-Gyn records.I should mention throughout this movie Frances does not even have the damned civility to learn Italian.  Apparently, evening classes were held so that the villagers could communicate in broken English. To add insult to injury, it seems living in Italy is enough to give you INCREDIBLE COOKING ABILITY.  These ladies have been cooking Italian for 50 years, and Diane Lane blows them out of the water after 2 months.There's also an amazingly irritating retired actress who decides to dress up like Fellini characters and makes a spectacle of herself in public. I imagine this is supposed to be a tribute to one of the greats of film, but if I received a tribute like this, I would poke out my eyes.Anyhow, at the end, there's a nice wedding at the house and Diane West's character falls for a nice Italian guy.  Miraculously, the faucet in the house begins to work.  Of course, there is no symbolism intended, unless to suggest two hours of your life have gone down the drain.This film may be insulting to lesbians, Eurotrash, Tuscan villagers, Italian immigration officials, and people who hate clumsy symbolism.  The whole movie is like some poor romance novel combined with the DNA of a witless idealist and a tract on colonialism, exposed to gamma radiation for 48 hours, and then unleashed upon an unsuspecting world.  Some movies break suspension of disbelief for a moment and are ruined.  Under the Tuscan Sun would just like to break into suspension of disbelief once.  It looks and feels like the naive dreams of a housewife who couldn't point Italy out on a labeled map and thinks folks in different countries all just speak English with different accents.Two stars, simply because every movie I see from now on, no matter how horrible it is, I can say, ""well, it beats Under the Tuscan Sun"".",2,Kiss of  Death For Males,1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,6670,"['Now',
