1653844,AURSI8ZL0P3XP,B00D6I7EC0,Cat,"[1, 1]","This is an enjoyable, fun film to watch.  It's not a religious film, but--as the Salvation Army's mission is to preach the gospel and to help those in need--the theme of giving is weaved into the story.  The main character, a self-centered sports anchor for a local news station, is sentenced to community service as a Salvation Army bell ringer for inadvertently assaulting a referee during his son's basketball game.  After a series of personal let-downs, the man--through his involvement with the &#34;Army&#34;--learns the true meaning of Christmas and the gifts that come with helping others.  This is a nice little film that stands out from the rest of this season's holiday offerings that are all about shopping, over-indulgence and shameless cross-promotion (think Hallmark ornaments and Werthers candies).",5,"Not a religious film, but one about helping others.",1386633600,"12 10, 2013",2013,814,"['enjoyable', 'fun', 'film', 'watch', 'not', 'religious', 'film', 'Salvation', 'Army', 'mission', 'preach', 'gospel', 'help', 'need', 'theme', 'giving', 'weaved', 'story', 'main', 'character', 'self-centered', 'sports', 'anchor', 'local', 'news', 'station', 'sentenced', 'community', 'service', 'Salvation', 'Army', 'bell', 'ringer', 'inadvertently', 'assaulting', 'referee', 'son', 'basketball', 'game', 'series', 'personal', 'let-downs', 'man', 'involvement', '34', 'Army', '34', 'true', 'meaning', 'Christmas', 'gifts', 'come', 'helping', 'others', 'nice', 'little', 'film', 'out', 'rest', 'season', 'holiday', 'offerings', 'are', 'shopping', 'over-indulgence', 'shameless', 'cross-promotion', 'think', 'Hallmark', 'ornaments', 'Werthers', 'candies']",Silver Bells
