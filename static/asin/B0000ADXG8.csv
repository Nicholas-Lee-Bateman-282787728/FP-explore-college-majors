762424,A10XJR7CWHNKWU,B0000ADXG8,Alan Caylow,"[45, 48]","""The Gunfighters"" is hardly one of William Hartnell's best ""Doctor Who"" stories. In fact, this story, in which the Doctor (Hartnell), Steven (Peter Purves) and Dodo (Jackie Lane) get mixed up in the legendary Gunfight At The OK Corral, had the reputation for many years as being the all-time worst ""Doctor Who"" story ever made! It's horribly acted (with the exception of the three leads), with several supporting actors doing horrible American accents (or not even trying to), the script is poorly written, the direction is misguided, and the big final gunfight is horribly staged (all that shooting at each other at close range and *missing*---pathetic!). And then there's that annoying song about The Last Chance Saloon that plays over and over and over and OVER again throughout the whole damm story!But the one saving grace of ""The Gunfighters"" is that it's funny, even if most of the laughs are unintentional. Hartnell and Purves are both a hoot in this one---the Doctor and his amusing toothache problem, and Steven hilariously being forced to sing ""The Last Chance Saloon"" song at gunpoint---and, of course, the mistakes I've mentioned above. And, to it's credit, the story never commits the crime of being boring. ""The Gunfighters"" is a trainwreck, but at least it's a funny, entertaining trainwreck. A masterpiece it ain't, but, in it's own very strange, very goofball way, ""The Gunfighters"" still manages to be fun. In short, it's the best bad ""Doctor Who"" story ever made.

762428,AW135H6P4JXKC,B0000ADXG8,buckbooks,"[3, 3]","It's easy to jeer at this early Doctor Who story set in the Wild West. Americans forget that shooting a western is easy only if you happen to live in the American West. Just drive a few miles out of almost any town in California, for instance, and you're there (this is why Hollywood is in California, not New Jersey). Guess where location shooting was done for most of the Have Gun Will Travel series: would you believe rural Oregon? But try shooting a western in London. You'll end up taping the whole thing inside a cramped TV studio.""The Gunfighters"" does a pretty amazing job pulling this off, with one caveat: The actors (all drawn from the U.K. and Canada) can't speak in a convincing western accent to save their lives. Many sound like cowboys from Australia. Peter Purves (Steven) is particularly bad in the dialect department, just as he was in the earlier Doctor Who story ""The Chase,"" where he plays a hick American tourist visiting the Empire State Building. Other than problems with dialogue, though, ""The Gunfighters"" is a minor marvel from a production standpoint. The show's ratings were terrible, but that was because westerns from America had already filled the U.K.'s airwaves for years and British audiences were simply growing weary of them.The story was shot in Ealing Studios and at BBC Television Centre 4 in Shepherd's Bush with a mind-boggling six cameras. Doctor Who was shot ""live to tape"" during this period, which meant cameras and actors had to move between sets as each episode was taped in near real time like a stage play (if an actor didn't have time to move to the next set before the next scene, the crew had to take a taping break). Turn on the production notes and you'll see some of the problems this caused: cameras inadvertently reflected in windows and saloon mirrors; one camera jiggling as another camera passed behind it; and, of course, actors fluffing lines that further muddle the story but can't be reshot because there simply wasn't time.The production notes also help viewers separate historical fact from TV fiction as ""The Gunfighters"" revisits one of the most mythologized events in U.S. history: the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. The Doctor, Steven and Dodo arrive in Tombstone, Arizona, in 1881 in search of a dentist to treat the Doctor for toothache. So ""the Doc,"" who is on ""holiday"" to get a tooth pulled, is soon mistaken for the town dentist, Doc Holliday, a notorious gunfighter and friend of Wyatt Earp. The Clanton gang is gunning for Holliday, and the story injects another gunfighter with a grudge, Johnny Ringo, although he and Holliday wouldn't shoot it out until months after the historic fracas at the O.K. Corral. This infamous gunfight, involving the Earps, Holliday and the Clantons, has been recounted inaccurately so many times in books, movies and television (even Star Trek!) that no fallacies Doctor Who could possibly add would make any difference. As it is, the gunfight is re-created here with the usual mixture of unsubstantiated speculation and outright errors, but so what.Be sure to check out the Special Features menu for a fascinating 45-minute documentary on the decline of William Hartnell as the First Doctor and his eventual replacement by Patrick Troughton. Steven and Dodo (Jackie Lane) were also soon written out of the series after ""The Gunfighters"" and replaced by Ben and Polly (Michael Craze and Anneke Wills), new companions who would take the series into the swinging '60s.

762430,AN9J46667D80O,B0000ADXG8,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[1, 2]","Many Doctor Who fans have somewhat less than fond memories of ""The Gunfighters,"" a First Doctor serial that aired from April 30 - May 21, 1966. I hadn't seen it until this DVD was released, but I'd heard about it long before from people who really disliked it.I am therefore happy to report that it's actually pretty decent! Not great, by any means. It's not even ""Great for a First Doctor story"" or ""Great for a historical"". But it is acceptable and it is enjoyable.The plot concerns the Doctor, Steven and Dodo arriving in Tombstone, Arizona, in 1881 just a day or two before the infamous Gunfight at the OK Corral. When they arrive the Doctor is complaining of a toothache. Naturally with access to dentists everywhere in space and time he decides to go with Doc Holliday in the Old West. The fact that appears as a viable option may be commentary on the state of British dentistry in the 1960s...Almost as soon as the TARDIS trio set foot outside the stable where they've landed, they're accosted by Sheriff Wyatt Earp, who warns them about the place and offers them his protection. They then split up, with the Doctor looking for Doc Holliday while Steven and Dodo pretend to be vaudeville stars (yes, you read that right).While this is going on, Ike Clanton and his gang are preparing for trouble, planning to corner and kill Doc Holliday as part of their sinister plan to do... I don't know what, really, but it's all quite exciting! Holliday gets wind of this and, after treating the Doctor, dresses him to look like Holliday himself. Before long the troubles build up, the Doctor gets arrested (for his own safety), Steven nearly gets shot, Dodo gets taken hostage and through it all there's singing. Endless singing.I was somewhat surprised at how enjoyable this story is. It's nicely paced, well-acted (especially once you get past the attempted American accents in part one), and establishes the Doctor's very strong dislike of guns in no uncertain terms. The sets were also really good and the whole thing was nicely atmospheric, and a little more adult than the show usually was.On the other hand, there's the historical accuracy, which is minimal. Even worse, though, there's... that song... ""The Ballad of the Last Chance Saloon"". It's not horrible, but it is constant. Every three minutes or so you hear a line or two from it, and that's not an exaggeration. It's an ok song, but not so good that I want to hear it endlessly.As usual with the old series DVDs, there's more extras here than you can shake a Colt .45 at (sorry, sorry...)! You get the expected commentary with actors Peter Purves (Steven), Shane Rimmer (Seth Harper), David Graham (Charlie), and Richard Beale (Bat Masterson), and production assistant Tristian de Vere Cole, all moderated by Toby Hadoke, best known for ""Moths Ate my Doctor Who Scarf.""Additionally you get the First Doctor version of ""Tomorrow's Times,"" a new series on the discs that shows contemporary media coverage of the program, with this version hosted by Mary Tamm (Romana I). You also get a photo gallery, PDF materials and an excellent documentary called ""The End of the Line."" It talks about the problems the series had during its third year, and includes interviews with Purves as well some of the other actors, including Maureen O'Brien (Vicki). And for people like me, who've always wondered, you get some insight into why Jackie Lane left the series (short version: she didn't look young enough on camera and was written out while her first serial was still airing).The Gunfight at the OK Corral has made its way into Western mythology like almost nothing else, and that's a surprise considering just how short it was. The whole thing lasted only 30 seconds, but from that we've gotten this story, the third-season Star Trek episode ""Spectre of the Gun,"" and numerous movies and books. It's really quite amazing the industry it spawned.Ultimately I recommend this disc, but really only for the fans. If you've got someone you're trying to get interested in the series, there's probably better choices. But for what this is, it's pretty decent and far better than the detractors would have you believe.",4,There'll be blood upon the sawdust of the Last Chance Saloon...,1310947200,"07 18, 2011",2011,4164,"['Many', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fans', 'have', 'somewhat', 'less', 'fond', 'memories', 'Gunfighters', 'First', 'Doctor', 'serial', 'aired', 'April', '30', 'May', '21', '1966', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', ""'d"", 'heard', 'long', 'before', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'disliked', 'it.I', 'am', 'therefore', 'happy', 'report', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'Not', 'great', 'means', 'not', 'even', 'Great', 'First', 'Doctor', 'story', 'Great', 'historical', 'acceptable', 'enjoyable.The', 'plot', 'concerns', 'Doctor', 'Steven', 'Dodo', 'arriving', 'Tombstone', 'Arizona', '1881', 'just', 'day', 'two', 'infamous', 'Gunfight', 'OK', 'Corral', 'When', 'arrive', 'Doctor', 'complaining', 'toothache', 'Naturally', 'access', 'dentists', 'everywhere', 'space', 'time', 'go', 'Doc', 'Holliday', 'Old', 'West', 'fact', 'viable', 'option', 'may', 'be', 'commentary', 'state', 'British', 'dentistry', '1960s', 'Almost', 'as', 'soon', 'TARDIS', 'trio', 'set', 'foot', 'stable', 'where', ""'ve"", 'landed', ""'re"", 'accosted', 'Sheriff', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'who', 'place', 'protection', 'then', 'split', 'up', 'Doctor', 'looking', 'Doc', 'Holliday', 'Steven', 'Dodo', 'pretend', 'be', 'vaudeville', 'stars', 'yes', 'read', 'right', 'going', 'Ike', 'Clanton', 'gang', 'are', 'preparing', 'trouble', 'planning', 'corner', 'kill', 'Doc', 'Holliday', 'part', 'sinister', 'plan', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'really', 'quite', 'exciting', 'Holliday', 'wind', 'treating', 'Doctor', 'look', 'Holliday', 'long', 'troubles', 'build', 'up', 'Doctor', 'arrested', 'own', 'safety', 'Steven', 'nearly', 'shot', 'Dodo', 'taken', 'hostage', 'singing', 'Endless', 'singing.I', 'was', 'somewhat', 'surprised', 'how', 'enjoyable', 'story', 'nicely', 'paced', 'well-acted', 'especially', 'once', 'get', 'attempted', 'American', 'accents', 'part', 'one', 'Doctor', 'very', 'strong', 'dislike', 'guns', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'sets', 'were', 'also', 'really', 'good', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'nicely', 'atmospheric', 'little', 'more', 'adult', 'show', 'usually', 'was.On', 'other', 'hand', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'minimal', 'Even', 'worse', 'song', 'Ballad', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Saloon', 'not', 'horrible', 'constant', 'three', 'minutes', 'so', 'hear', 'line', 'two', 'not', 'exaggeration', 'ok', 'song', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'want', 'hear', 'endlessly.As', 'usual', 'old', 'series', 'DVDs', 'more', 'extras', 'here', 'can', 'shake', 'Colt', '.45', 'sorry', 'sorry', 'get', 'expected', 'commentary', 'actors', 'Peter', 'Purves', 'Steven', 'Shane', 'Rimmer', 'Seth', 'Harper', 'David', 'Graham', 'Charlie', 'Richard', 'Beale', 'Bat', 'Masterson', 'production', 'assistant', 'Tristian', 'Vere', 'Cole', 'all', 'moderated', 'Toby', 'Hadoke', 'best', 'known', 'Moths', 'Ate', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Scarf', 'Additionally', 'get', 'First', 'Doctor', 'version', 'Tomorrow', 'Times', 'new', 'series', 'discs', 'contemporary', 'media', 'coverage', 'program', 'version', 'hosted', 'Mary', 'Tamm', 'Romana', 'also', 'get', 'photo', 'gallery', 'PDF', 'materials', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'called', 'End', 'Line', 'problems', 'series', 'had', 'third', 'year', 'interviews', 'Purves', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'actors', 'including', 'Maureen', ""O'Brien"", 'Vicki', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wondered', 'get', 'insight', 'why', 'Jackie', 'Lane', 'left', 'series', 'short', 'version', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'young', 'enough', 'camera', 'was', 'written', 'out', 'first', 'serial', 'was', 'still', 'airing', '.The', 'Gunfight', 'OK', 'Corral', 'made', 'way', 'Western', 'mythology', 'almost', 'nothing', 'else', 'surprise', 'considering', 'just', 'how', 'short', 'was', 'whole', 'thing', 'lasted', 'only', '30', 'seconds', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'story', 'third-season', 'Star', 'Trek', 'episode', 'Spectre', 'Gun', 'numerous', 'movies', 'books', 'really', 'quite', 'amazing', 'industry', 'spawned.Ultimately', 'recommend', 'disc', 'really', 'only', 'fans', ""'ve"", 'got', 'someone', ""'re"", 'trying', 'get', 'interested', 'series', 'probably', 'better', 'choices', 'what', 'pretty', 'decent', 'far', 'better', 'detractors', 'would', 'have', 'believe']",Doctor Who - The Gunfighters VHS
762431,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B0000ADXG8,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[6, 9]","&quot;So fill up your glasses/And join in the song/The Law's right behind you/And it won't take long./So come, you coyotes,/And howl at the moon/Till there's blood upon the sawdust/In &quot;The Last Chance&quot; Saloon.&quot;From 25-26 October, 1881, in Tombstone, Arizona, that's what the Doctor, Dodo, and Steven take-kind of.  Once they find out where they are, the Doctor's two companions are delighted and get geared up.  Steven has always wanted to be a cowboy, but has a loud white shirt that really begs for the fashion police to arrest him.  Dodo's white shirt and long brown skirt are sensible yet stylish.The three take aliases, Dr. Caligari, Steven Regret, a singer, and Dodo Dupont, a piano player.  Steven hates his alias, only to be remonstrated by the Doctor.  &quot;Tell them you're from outer space and you'll be arrested on a vagrancy charge.&quot;  Dodo does get into the spirit of the scene more.  When asked by Charlie the bartender if she's a piano player, she says, &quot;Darn tootin'&quot; in an American accent.  She does play some tunes at the Last Chance Saloon, and Steven does sing the giddy title ballad, whose verses are sung throughout the story by Lynda Baron.  Examples:  &quot;It's your last chance of boozin'/where there's no one to find/it's your last chance of losin'/and the first place you find/it's your last chance of earning/your gunfighter's fee/the pay is in dollars/but the bullets are free.&quot;  or &quot;So pick him up gentle/and carry him so/he's gone kind of mental, from Earp's heavy blow.&quot;The Doctor has a toothache and guess who the local dentist happens to be?  Doc Holliday, and it's the latter's machinations, such as ostensibly loaning the Doctor his gun, marked personally, to make him more spiffy that causes a case of mistaken identity, as the Clanton Brothers think the Time Lord is Doc Holliday.  As Doc had recently killed their brother Reuben, they're out to even the score. &quot;Good thing I didn't have my tonsils out,&quot; the Doctor mutters as he leaves the surgery.  That's the least of his troubles, as this case of mistaken identity leads to Wyatt Earp arresting the Doctor and keeping him in jail to protect him from the Clantons.  More than that, Pa Clanton hires the deadly and menacing Johnny Ringo, ace gunfighter, who too has a score to settle with Holliday, and was also the former sweetheart of Holliday's wife, Kate Elder.The Doctor is annoyed at Earp and Bat Masterson, and wants to get out of here, but the two lawmen are actually instrumental in keeping him alive, particularly from a lynching from the townfolk.  John Alderson (Earp) and Richard Beale (Masterson) do great performances, BTW.And at least Jackie Lane (Dodo) seems to be enjoying herself.  Sheena Marshe plays Kate Elder as a brassy Mae West-ish manner, but Anthony Jacbos as Doc Holliday is a delight, with a mischievous twinkle in his eye, a big difference from that of Victor Mature.  Laurence Payne (Ringo) came out in two Who stories, in The Leisure Hive as Morix and The Two Doctors as Dastari.Clearly, the historicity of this is based more on popular myth and the Hollywood treatment Tombstone has been given.  For example, Johnny Ringo survived the OK Corral, as he died on 14 July 1882.  Because the viewer ratings on this were so low (at that time in the show's history, anyway), writer Donald Cotton's association with Doctor Who came to a quick end--he was never commissioned to write anything again.  But other stories have had worse ratings, and this one, mostly played for laughs, is a novelty tale, so thank you, Donald Cotton.

762434,A13QGWFZ03F4F6,B0000ADXG8,"HarryFan ""CourseHead""","[3, 6]","Exactly what is it that makes this late First Doctor sojourn in the American West so staggeringly awful?  Mr. Hartnell is no worse than usual (calling Wyatt Earp ""Wurp"" intentionally (which isn't funny), and calling sidekick Stephen ""Steving"" unintentionally (which is); and this time finishing only every third or fourth line with ""hmmm . . .?"" - not too many ""deah boy""s in this outing, either), and the aptly named Dodo and the future host of the fabled ""Blue Peter"" series, surely among the weakest set of companions, are no duller than they usually are, with Peter Purvis even somewhat engaging as a barroom songster, for a few moments at least. So I suppose it's the combination of the ludicrous British ""Wild West"" accents and posturing, the hokey delivery of every cast member except our trio (is this how American productions of Shakespeare sound to English ears?), and the endless intrusions of the obnoxious unseen background quasi-singer (she of the warbly near-approximations of pitch in the wheezy, faux-folk tune and ""authentic"" lyrics that tinnily echo the plot ""developments"" irritatingly every two or three minutes - ""Charlie's got his head blowed in/  Now he's through with rye and gin/ At the Last Chance Saloon, the La - a - ast Chance Salo-o-on"") and harpsichord accompaniment (or whatever that tinkly thing is that's playing - Hungarian cembalom perchance?), that makes this stinker the very worst Doctor Who story I can think of, outdoing even the thrice-dreadful Sylvester McCoy debut, ""Time and the Rani.""  BBC meets Ed Wood.  Don't get me wrong - I usually enjoy the First Doctor very much, because of (rather than despite) his fluffed lines and small repertoire of predictable ""characterizing"" points (holding his lapels, rocking on his heels, etc. etc.) - and he created this greatest of great roles, after all.  But this one is nearly unwatchable.  Maybe Brits would enjoy it, as a sort of Englishizing of the Wild West.  The rest of us probably won't.  See it only if you manage to survive ""Web Planet.""

762435,AOHCEEEJRZUI9,B0000ADXG8,Hatbox Dragon,"[2, 2]","A Season 3 episode set between The Celestial Toymaker and The Savages, starring William Hartnell as the First Doctor with Dodo (Jackie Lane) and Steven (Peter Purves).For the first-time viewer, the setup of the Doctor Who series is basic enough: the Doctor is an alien who adventures in time and space in his TARDIS, usually with a human companion or two.  I don't think you need to have seen the series before to enjoy The Gunfighters, but you do need to bear in mind that this is a small budget series made in the late 60s with the concomitant production issues.  In other words, don't expect too much and you may be pleasantly surprised.  Or not.The TARDIS arrives in Tombstone just in time for the gunfight at the OK Corral.  But will the machinations of Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp harm or help the Doctor and his friends?I suppose this struck me first and foremost as an example of how much Doctor Who has changed over the years.  I was surprised at how nave the Doctor was in this story and how overshadowed he was by the other characters, but his devotion to his travelling companions and his commitment to non-violence were as expected.  This was the first time I'd seen Dodo or Steven, and I've got nothing to complain about with them.  I liked their spirit, their sense of fun, and the contribution they made to the action.  Overall this is a fun adventure, but it's a Western in which the Doctor makes an appearance rather than a story about the Doctor.  This struck me as atypical of the other First Doctor episodes I've seen.It's Doc Holliday (Anthony Jacobs) who dominates this story.  As portrayed here, he's a manipulative, cold-blooded killer with a soft streak, a self-proclaimed gentleman who puts such pretensions aside when it suits him.  Wyatt Earp (John Alderson) also makes a strong showing, balancing his duty as a lawman with his loyalties to family and friends.  Kate (Sheena Marshe) has plenty of screen time as Holliday's fianc&eacute;e and strikes a decent balance between independence and devotion to her man, but she's not the most sympathetic character.  Subsequent research showed me that the historical elements of this story aren't especially accurate; purists might object to this.The Gunfighters has a clever premise and a well-constructed script.  Considering the production limitations of the period it's quite imaginatively shot and the sets and costumes are decent, though some of the guest cast leave a lot to be desired.  The ""Ballad of the Last Chance Saloon"" is a linking device that refreshes the viewer's memory and helps establish the period feel, though you may get pretty sick of it after a while.  If this episode suffers from anything, it's a lack of extras.  The streets and saloons of Tombstone are largely deserted, which doesn't feel at all realistic.  Someone should remake this with the production input the script deserves.No comment on the DVD extras.(For some reason, my copy of The Gunfighters was sold in a boxed set with the Fifth Doctor episodeDoctor Who: The Awakening - Episode 132, the whole being titled as ""Earth Tales"". I see no reason for this, because the two episodes have absolutely nothing to do with each other.)",3,"""All these people are giving me guns, I do wish they wouldn't.""",1349308800,"10 4, 2012",2012,3191,"['Season', '3', 'episode', 'set', 'Celestial', 'Toymaker', 'Savages', 'starring', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'First', 'Doctor', 'Dodo', 'Jackie', 'Lane', 'Steven', 'Peter', 'Purves', '.For', 'first-time', 'viewer', 'setup', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'series', 'basic', 'enough', 'Doctor', 'alien', 'who', 'time', 'space', 'TARDIS', 'usually', 'human', 'companion', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'need', 'have', 'seen', 'series', 'enjoy', 'Gunfighters', 'do', 'need', 'bear', 'mind', 'small', 'budget', 'series', 'made', 'late', '60s', 'concomitant', 'production', 'issues', 'other', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'may', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'not.The', 'TARDIS', 'Tombstone', 'just', 'time', 'gunfight', 'OK', 'Corral', 'will', 'machinations', 'Doc', 'Holliday', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'harm', 'help', 'Doctor', 'friends', 'suppose', 'struck', 'first', 'foremost', 'example', 'how', 'much', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'changed', 'years', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'nave', 'Doctor', 'was', 'story', 'how', 'overshadowed', 'was', 'other', 'characters', 'devotion', 'travelling', 'companions', 'commitment', 'non-violence', 'were', 'expected', 'was', 'first', 'time', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Dodo', 'Steven', ""'ve"", 'got', 'nothing', 'complain', 'liked', 'spirit', 'sense', 'fun', 'contribution', 'made', 'action', 'Overall', 'fun', 'adventure', 'Western', 'Doctor', 'appearance', 'rather', 'story', 'Doctor', 'struck', 'atypical', 'other', 'First', 'Doctor', ""'ve"", 'seen.It', 'Doc', 'Holliday', 'Anthony', 'Jacobs', 'who', 'story', 'portrayed', 'here', 'manipulative', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'soft', 'streak', 'self-proclaimed', 'gentleman', 'who', 'such', 'pretensions', 'aside', 'when', 'suits', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'John', 'Alderson', 'also', 'strong', 'showing', 'balancing', 'duty', 'lawman', 'loyalties', 'family', 'friends', 'Kate', 'Sheena', 'Marshe', 'plenty', 'screen', 'time', 'Holliday', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'decent', 'balance', 'independence', 'devotion', 'man', 'not', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Subsequent', 'research', 'showed', 'historical', 'elements', 'story', 'are', ""n't"", 'especially', 'accurate', 'purists', 'might', 'object', 'this.The', 'Gunfighters', 'clever', 'premise', 'well-constructed', 'script', 'Considering', 'production', 'limitations', 'period', 'quite', 'imaginatively', 'shot', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'decent', 'guest', 'cast', 'leave', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'Ballad', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Saloon', 'linking', 'device', 'viewer', 'memory', 'establish', 'period', 'feel', 'may', 'get', 'pretty', 'sick', 'while', 'episode', 'suffers', 'anything', 'lack', 'extras', 'streets', 'saloons', 'Tombstone', 'are', 'largely', 'deserted', ""n't"", 'feel', 'realistic', 'Someone', 'should', 'remake', 'production', 'input', 'script', 'deserves.No', 'comment', 'DVD', 'extras', 'reason', 'copy', 'Gunfighters', 'was', 'sold', 'boxed', 'set', 'Fifth', 'Doctor', 'episodeDoctor', 'Who', 'Awakening', 'Episode', '132', 'whole', 'being', 'titled', 'Earth', 'Tales', 'see', 'reason', 'two', 'episodes', 'have', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'other']",Doctor Who - The Gunfighters VHS

Bowden ""Zodgilla""","[2, 4]","""The Gunfighters"" was long considered the absolute worst episode of Doctor Who (unfortunately, some of Sylvester McCoy's early episodes are contenders), so it's in some ways sad that this series of episodes still exist while so many better ones are seemingly lost forever.

The accents are simply awful, but the really painful part is the warbling saloon ballad that runs through the episodes.  And, for me, the character Dodo.However, it's good to see it released for completeness' sake and for the solid bonus documentary on the series' third season.

762443,A3TRXPRUYVOLSM,B0000ADXG8,Little Roy Blue,"[18, 20]","I've never understood why Doctor Who fans hate ""The Gunfighters"" so much. Years ago, I read a ton of negative fan reviews, which tended to judge this story as a laughably poor attempt at drama. More recently, a growing number of fans have acknowledged that ""The Gunfighters"" is supposed to be a comedy, not a drama; yet they still tend to laugh *at* the story, rather than *with* it. Well, for what it's worth, I laugh with it.To be more specific: I find ""The Gunfighters"" to be a legitimately witty spoof of the American Western genre. Donald Cotton's script purposefully indulges in a host of Western cliches, and then ""winks"" at the audience about this. The much-loathed ""Ballad of the Last Chance Saloon"" - a narrative song that runs through the whole story - is used to highlight the silliness and cliched nature of the action, and thus doesn't bother me at all. (Indeed, strange lines like ""he's gone a bit mental under Earp's heavy blow"" always give me a chuckle.)Cotton's dialog is often clever, with many funny exchanges. (Clanton: ""I never figured you for a back-shooter, Ringo."" Ringo: ""I never figured you for any kind of shooter."") The guest actors are often criticized for their silly American accents, but I find them to be no more or less phony than the American accents I hear on British TV today; and silly accent or no, Anthony Jacobs makes a super-cool Doc Holliday.Fans also often mock the sets in this production, but this strikes me as a strange criticism too, because they're good by the standards of 1960s Doctor Who. Indeed, I like period sets such as the interior of Holliday's dental practice much more than the bland white corridors featured in so many Doctor Who episodes. Of course, the sets aren't good enough to convince me that ""The Gunfighters"" was filmed on location in Tombstone, but that's okay; I thought the new Harry Potter movie looked obviously studio-bound, too. :-)In short, this is an underrated serial, though its appeal is clearly limited to those who respond well to its peculiar sense of humor. Surprisingly - considering that it's so hated - ""The Gunfighters"" gets a pretty nice DVD package, which includes a great documentary on William Hartnell's third season that's full of juicy behind-the-scenes gossip. Another featurette covers (mostly hostile) press reaction to Doctor Who in its early days. Neither of these features deals much with the production of ""The Gunfighters,"" specifically, so fortunately there's an audio commentary track featuring several enthusiastic members of the production team. Overall, I'd say both the serial and the DVD get 4 out of 5 stars, making them equal partners in awesomeness.",4,"Amazingly enough, I actually like this story...",1311120000,"07 20, 2011",2011,2665,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'understood', 'why', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'hate', 'Gunfighters', 'so', 'much', 'Years', 'ago', 'read', 'ton', 'negative', 'fan', 'reviews', 'tended', 'judge', 'story', 'laughably', 'poor', 'attempt', 'drama', 'More', 'recently', 'growing', 'number', 'fans', 'have', 'acknowledged', 'Gunfighters', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'not', 'drama', 'still', 'tend', 'laugh', 'story', 'rather', '*with*', 'Well', 'what', 'worth', 'laugh', 'it.To', 'be', 'more', 'specific', 'find', 'Gunfighters', 'be', 'legitimately', 'witty', 'spoof', 'American', 'Western', 'genre', 'Donald', 'Cotton', 'script', 'purposefully', 'host', 'Western', 'cliches', 'then', 'winks', 'audience', 'much-loathed', 'Ballad', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Saloon', 'narrative', 'song', 'whole', 'story', 'used', 'highlight', 'silliness', 'cliched', 'nature', 'action', 'thus', ""n't"", 'bother', 'Indeed', 'strange', 'lines', 'gone', 'bit', 'mental', 'Earp', 'heavy', 'blow', 'always', 'give', 'chuckle', 'Cotton', 'dialog', 'often', 'clever', 'many', 'funny', 'exchanges', 'Clanton', 'never', 'figured', 'back-shooter', 'Ringo', 'Ringo', 'never', 'figured', 'kind', 'shooter', 'guest', 'actors', 'are', 'often', 'criticized', 'silly', 'American', 'accents', 'find', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'less', 'phony', 'American', 'accents', 'hear', 'British', 'TV', 'today', 'silly', 'accent', 'Anthony', 'Jacobs', 'super-cool', 'Doc', 'Holliday.Fans', 'also', 'often', 'sets', 'production', 'strange', 'criticism', 'too', ""'re"", 'good', 'standards', '1960s', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Indeed', 'like', 'period', 'sets', 'such', 'interior', 'Holliday', 'dental', 'practice', 'much', 'more', 'bland', 'white', 'corridors', 'featured', 'so', 'many', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'course', 'sets', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'convince', 'Gunfighters', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'Tombstone', 'okay', 'thought', 'new', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'looked', 'obviously', 'studio-bound', 'too', 'short', 'underrated', 'serial', 'appeal', 'clearly', 'limited', 'who', 'respond', 'well', 'peculiar', 'sense', 'humor', 'Surprisingly', 'considering', 'so', 'hated', 'Gunfighters', 'pretty', 'nice', 'DVD', 'package', 'great', 'documentary', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'third', 'season', 'full', 'juicy', 'behind-the-scenes', 'gossip', 'featurette', 'mostly', 'hostile', 'press', 'reaction', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'early', 'days', 'features', 'deals', 'much', 'production', 'Gunfighters', 'specifically', 'so', 'fortunately', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'featuring', 'several', 'enthusiastic', 'members', 'production', 'team', 'Overall', ""'d"", 'say', 'serial', 'DVD', 'get', '4', '5', 'stars', 'making', 'equal', 'partners', 'awesomeness']",Doctor Who - The Gunfighters VHS
