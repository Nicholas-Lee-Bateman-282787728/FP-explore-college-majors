This movie is well worth it and now we get to see the deleted scenes we've been waiting for. I hope the rest of the 80's classics get this treatment. It's awesome that Matt Dillon, Ralph Macchio, C. Thomas Howell, Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe and Diane Lane all made a commentary segment for this DVD, the only bad thing is Tom and Emilio aren't in the commentary.Just watched my Copy of THE OUTSIDERS---Wow. This was so freakin' awesome you guys. There is 22 extra minutes added to the movie and 10 additional deleted scenes as special features. For the people who were disappointed in the movie because it lacked scenes from the book you have got to buy this edition. All of the scenes are added to the movie like I previously said. The special features are outstanding as well. They show a reunion at Francis Ford Coppola 's house screening the new extended movie with Diane Lane, C. Thomas Howell, Patrick Swayze and Ralph Macchio. There are cast interviews and a special with S. E. Hinton talking about the book and the movie. She also shows the places the movie took place. Like the movie theater, the school, the brothers house and the street Dallas was killed.

235745,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,6300270033,A. Gammill,"[1, 1]","I was 14 when a friend introduced me to S.E. Hinton's classic novel.  A year later, we were overjoyed to learn the book was being made into a film.  And we enjoyed the film, for the most part.  But, like so many others have said, we also knew that much of the book didn't make it to the screen.  So I am especially thrilled to find this new release with several restored scenes.  The major additions are at the beginning and end (a full 10 minutes of new material unfolds in the beginning, before the theatrical version even begins).  The other minor additions mostly occur during the middle section, while Ponyboy and Johnny are hiding out at the church.The cast & director commentaries are quite enjoyable.  Coppola defends his decision to alter the film's soundtrack, but anyone who's seen the new version will likely disagree.  Replacing Carmine Coppola's orchestral score with surf music and about a half dozen Elvis songs (which are historically as well as dramatically out of place) is a jarring experience for anyone familiar with the film.If you can overlook the soundtrack changes, this is certainly a marked improvement over the theatrical version of the film.  Now, if someone would just edit the original score back into this version, THE OUTSIDERS would be the film we've always wanted.",4,Great additional scenes & bonus features,1135555200,"12 26, 2005",2005,1300,"['was', '14', 'when', 'friend', 'introduced', 'S.E', 'Hinton', 'classic', 'novel', 'year', 'later', 'were', 'overjoyed', 'learn', 'book', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'also', 'knew', 'much', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'screen', 'am', 'especially', 'thrilled', 'find', 'new', 'release', 'several', 'restored', 'scenes', 'major', 'additions', 'are', 'beginning', 'end', 'full', '10', 'minutes', 'new', 'material', 'unfolds', 'beginning', 'theatrical', 'version', 'even', 'other', 'minor', 'additions', 'mostly', 'occur', 'middle', 'section', 'Ponyboy', 'Johnny', 'are', 'hiding', 'out', 'church.The', 'cast', 'director', 'commentaries', 'are', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'Coppola', 'decision', 'alter', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'new', 'version', 'will', 'likely', 'disagree', 'Replacing', 'Carmine', 'Coppola', 'orchestral', 'score', 'surf', 'music', 'half', 'dozen', 'Elvis', 'songs', 'are', 'historically', 'as', 'well', 'dramatically', 'place', 'jarring', 'experience', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'film.If', 'can', 'overlook', 'soundtrack', 'changes', 'certainly', 'marked', 'improvement', 'theatrical', 'version', 'film', 'Now', 'someone', 'would', 'just', 'edit', 'original', 'score', 'back', 'version', 'THE', 'OUTSIDERS', 'would', 'be', 'film', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted']",N/A
235746,AGEIT17HENDIS,6300270033,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 1]","Recently I reviewed another film adaptation by the director Francis Ford of one of S.E. Hinton's classic tales of American teenage working class alienation during the 1950s-1960s, ""Rumblefish"". There the plot centered on the seemingly inescapable nihilism following the footsteps of a leader, and his ex-leader brother, of a by then pass&eacute; white teenage gang. That film presented the anguish of youthful working class alienation in a very different and much less glamorous light than the teenage angst films of my youth, like Marlon Brando's ""The Wild Ones"" and James Dean's ""Rebel Without A Cause"". I also mentioned in that review that I had been momentarily attracted, very attracted, to that `lifestyle', coming as I did from that stratum of the working class that lived with few hopes and fewer dreams. It was a very near thing that shifted me away from that life, mainly the allure of books and less dangerous exploits.I did not feel that same kind of identification here in this otherwise outstanding tale of youthful working class alienation out in the heartland in the hill of Oklahoma, ""The Outsiders"". That, notwithstanding the fact that the main character and narrator, ""Pony Boy"", is also very attracted to books (although ""Gone With The Wind"" and the poetry of Robert Frost seem odd choices to go ga-ga over). The difference. In ""Rumblefish"", seemingly a much more experimental film on Coppola's part and a more searing look at working class youth on Hinton's part, the plot is is filled with examples of that unspoken danger, that unspoken destructive pathology and dead end nihilism that meant doom for at least some of the characters, and not just the easy to foresee one of early and untimely death that stalks those down at the edges of society.Superficially, the plot of ""The Outsiders"" would have assumed that same fate for its characters. A small town out in the hill of Oklahoma where the class divisions are obvious has the working class ""Greasers"" lined up in combat against the middle class ""Socs"" with every clich&eacute; of the class struggle, except the political, thrown in for good measure. (Obviously portrayed, as well, note the sideburns long hair on the Greaser side and the chino pants on the frat guys side. You don't need a scorecard on this one.) In summary: the two sides clash over nothing in particular except ""turf"": hold grudges; seek revenge taking causalities, one fatally; and ending with a rumble where the Greasers have their momentary Pyrrhic victory.Along the way there is plenty of time for youthful reflection by the narrator and his fellows about the ways of the class-ridden world, a few bouts heroism and a little off-hand (very off-hand) romance. As much as we know about the nature of modern class society this thing rings false. The moral here-even the most alienated Greaser, played to a tee by Matt Dillon, is really only searching for meaning to his life and a little society, only to get waylaid by that life in the end. Thus, this thing turns into something more like a cautionary tale than a slice of live down at the bottom edges of society. The more circumspect and existential ""Rumblefish"" gets my vote any day.Note: Part of the problem with this film cinematically is that the leading male actors here, the likes of Rob Lowe, the late Patrick Swayze, Tom Cruise and Matt Dillon are all too `pretty' to be Greasers. Although one can appreciate the talent pool that came out of this film I know from real life that, while the ""greasers"" of this world may have some raw sexually attractions they would hardly grace the pages of ""Gentleman's Quarterly"", or some such magazine. These guys could. That is what rings false here, as well as the assurances, hammered home to us throughout the story, that in democratic America even the down-trodden can lift themselves up and succeed.

235754,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,6300270033,Andrew Raker,"[9, 11]","*Because Amazon does not distinguish between reviews for the original cut and the revised cut of The Outsiders, this review discusses both cuts.Many differences exist between the original cut of The Outsiders and the revised cut. However, the most profound difference is the dramatic change of tone in the revised. The original cut, through its classic music (used sporadically) creates a melancholic tone. For me, the classic music makes me think about class conflict and highlights the deep friendship between Ponyboy Curtis and Johnny Cade. The classic music score is always appropriate in setting this mood. Furthermore, the classic music score is more intelligent and emotional than the revised, which makes the film far more relatable to people like me, who are not very interested in 60s rock and roll music or most films very popular to 21st century teenagers of lower social classes. Call me old fashioned, but I prefer classic music.In contrast, the revised cut, by employed 60s period music including songs like ""My Hair is a Mess"" when Ponyboy and Johnny are giving one another haircuts, alters the tone and creates a light mood, almost as though Ponyboy and Johnny are enjoying cutting one another's hair and causing the other pain, which is a stark contrast to the original. The original cut, by not playing music during the haircut scene, highlights the loss of identity that the haircuts produce. Remember: to these young Greasers, their long, greasy hair is a substantial part of their identity and should not be downplayed by crass 60s music.Secondly, the original cut focuses largely on the characters of Ponyboy and Johnny, with some time given to Dally. However, the revised cut widens the scope of the film to include more scenes in which other characters in the novel play a role, which somewhat diminishes the power of the relationship between Ponyboy and Johnny, which is quite strongly communicated in the original. Some scenes included in the revised cut do make sense. For instance, the scene in which the three Curtis brothers (after Johnny's and Dally's deaths) discuss how they only have one another and need to stand by one another. However, at other times, the revised cuts seen to take away from the message of the film. For instance, the scene in which Ponyboy asks an older man for directions to the location at which the abandoned church exists, simply adds a bit of humor to a film that is better communicated as a tragedy rather than a comedy. Adding comic scenes to the film as the revised cut does downplays its tragic elements, as does the rarely appropriate comic music. If the viewer is supposed to laugh when Johnny cuts Ponyboy's hair, the rock and roll music score is effective. In contrast, if the viewer is supposed to mourn the cutting of the hair as a loss of identity, the rock and roll score falls flat - in fact, it has the opposite effect.Thirdly, sometimes the rock and roll music starts at an inappropriate moment, such as in the scene in which Dally robs the store. The music begins when Dally demands money rather than, as in the original, when the cashier shoots at Dally. Thus, the music focuses on Dally's actions as its basis for existence rather than on the cashier's actions. In the original, with its dun-dun da-da da-da classic music, which begins when the cashier fires two shoots, we, as viewers, are supposed to see Dally as somewhat of a victim. After all, Dally just lost Johnny, the only person about whom he ever really cared. Also, sometimes the rock and roll music of the revised cut, begins or continues through some of Ponyboy's and Johnny's more intimate conversations, which, in addition to altering their serious interpersonal meaning, makes hearing the words of the conversation more difficult than in the original cut.Lastly, how a film ends is very important. The end of the original cut conveys Ponyboy's speech with very good and very melancholic classic music in the background, as though it is up to us whether we, as viewers, will embrace greater economic equality and secular humanism. In contrast, the revised cut downplays the original film's (and Johnny's) humanist message by having the less-effective and a bit too upbeat classical music of ""Stay Gold"" playing in the background.",5,My Comparison: Original (5 starts); Revised (3 stars),1323216000,"12 7, 2011",2011,4274,"['*Because', 'Amazon', 'not', 'distinguish', 'reviews', 'original', 'cut', 'revised', 'cut', 'Outsiders', 'review', 'cuts.Many', 'differences', 'exist', 'original', 'cut', 'Outsiders', 'revised', 'cut', 'However', 'most', 'profound', 'difference', 'dramatic', 'change', 'tone', 'revised', 'original', 'cut', 'classic', 'music', 'used', 'sporadically', 'melancholic', 'tone', 'classic', 'music', 'think', 'class', 'conflict', 'deep', 'friendship', 'Ponyboy', 'Curtis', 'Johnny', 'Cade', 'classic', 'music', 'score', 'always', 'appropriate', 'setting', 'mood', 'Furthermore', 'classic', 'music', 'score', 'more', 'intelligent', 'emotional', 'revised', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'relatable', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'interested', '60s', 'rock', 'roll', 'music', 'most', 'films', 'very', 'popular', '21st', 'century', 'teenagers', 'lower', 'social', 'classes', 'Call', 'old', 'fashioned', 'prefer', 'classic', 'music.In', 'contrast', 'revised', 'cut', 'employed', '60s', 'period', 'music', 'including', 'songs', 'Hair', 'Mess', 'when', 'Ponyboy', 'Johnny', 'are', 'giving', 'one', 'haircuts', 'tone', 'light', 'mood', 'almost', 'Ponyboy', 'Johnny', 'are', 'enjoying', 'cutting', 'one', 'hair', 'causing', 'other', 'pain', 'stark', 'contrast', 'original', 'original', 'cut', 'not', 'playing', 'music', 'haircut', 'scene', 'loss', 'identity', 'haircuts', 'produce', 'Remember', 'young', 'Greasers', 'long', 'greasy', 'hair', 'substantial', 'part', 'identity', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'downplayed', 'crass', '60s', 'music.Secondly', 'original', 'cut', 'largely', 'characters', 'Ponyboy', 'Johnny', 'time', 'given', 'Dally', 'However', 'revised', 'cut', 'scope', 'film', 'include', 'more', 'scenes', 'other', 'characters', 'novel', 'play', 'role', 'somewhat', 'power', 'relationship', 'Ponyboy', 'Johnny', 'quite', 'strongly', 'communicated', 'original', 'scenes', 'included', 'revised', 'cut', 'do', 'make', 'sense', 'instance', 'scene', 'three', 'Curtis', 'brothers', 'Johnny', 'Dally', 'deaths', 'discuss', 'how', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'need', 'stand', 'one', 'However', 'other', 'times', 'revised', 'cuts', 'seen', 'take', 'away', 'message', 'film', 'instance', 'scene', 'Ponyboy', 'older', 'man', 'directions', 'location', 'abandoned', 'church', 'exists', 'simply', 'bit', 'humor', 'film', 'better', 'communicated', 'tragedy', 'rather', 'comedy', 'Adding', 'comic', 'scenes', 'film', 'revised', 'cut', 'downplays', 'tragic', 'elements', 'rarely', 'appropriate', 'comic', 'music', 'viewer', 'supposed', 'laugh', 'when', 'Johnny', 'Ponyboy', 'hair', 'rock', 'roll', 'music', 'score', 'effective', 'contrast', 'viewer', 'supposed', 'mourn', 'cutting', 'hair', 'loss', 'identity', 'rock', 'roll', 'score', 'flat', 'fact', 'opposite', 'effect.Thirdly', 'sometimes', 'rock', 'roll', 'music', 'inappropriate', 'moment', 'such', 'scene', 'Dally', 'store', 'music', 'when', 'Dally', 'money', 'rather', 'original', 'when', 'cashier', 'shoots', 'Dally', 'Thus', 'music', 'Dally', 'actions', 'basis', 'existence', 'rather', 'cashier', 'actions', 'original', 'dun-dun', 'da-da', 'da-da', 'classic', 'music', 'when', 'cashier', 'two', 'shoots', 'viewers', 'are', 'supposed', 'see', 'Dally', 'somewhat', 'victim', 'Dally', 'just', 'lost', 'Johnny', 'only', 'person', 'whom', 'ever', 'really', 'cared', 'Also', 'sometimes', 'rock', 'roll', 'music', 'revised', 'cut', 'Ponyboy', 'Johnny', 'more', 'intimate', 'conversations', 'addition', 'altering', 'serious', 'interpersonal', 'meaning', 'hearing', 'words', 'conversation', 'more', 'difficult', 'original', 'cut.Lastly', 'how', 'film', 'very', 'important', 'end', 'original', 'cut', 'conveys', 'Ponyboy', 'speech', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'melancholic', 'classic', 'music', 'background', 'viewers', 'will', 'embrace', 'greater', 'economic', 'equality', 'secular', 'humanism', 'contrast', 'revised', 'cut', 'original', 'film', 'Johnny', 'humanist', 'message', 'having', 'less-effective', 'bit', 'too', 'upbeat', 'classical', 'music', 'Stay', 'Gold', 'playing', 'background']",N/A

I have been waiting forever for it, and the film is now on my Christmas list.Secondly, let me state that this is one of the best films of the 1980s'. Most films from that decade haven't really aged well. But this one has not lost anything. Maybe it's because it's directed by cinematic legend Francis Ford Coppola, whose legacy is timeless, maybe it's because the novle it's based on his remained a classic, or maybe it's because most of the film's stars are still famous today (Tom Cruise, for example.The film takes place in Tulsa in 1966. Back then, teenagers were devided into two groups. On one end of the spectrum, there's The Greasers. If you're a soc, you come from the poor side of town. You've been rejected by society. An outsider. On the other end, there's the Socs. If you're a soc, you're rich. You have money cars and women. You're both respected and feared. At a movie theater one night, Greasers Ponyboy (C. Thomas Howell) and Johnny (Ralph Maccio) hook up with Soc Cherry (Diane Lane). This doesn't sit well with Cherry's aggressive boyfriend Bob (Lief Garret, c'mon you remember him?)), who sees to it that these two will have nothing more to do with Cherry. When a walk in the park leaves Bob and a group of socs dead, Ponyboy and Johnny have to skip town to avoid the law. With the help of their resourceful friend Dallas (the always enjoyable Matt Dillon), Ponyboy and Johnny start a new life on the lamb, and the three become local heros when they resuce young children from a schoolfire, in which Johnny is seriously inujured. Old feuds are put to rest, and everything seems to be turning in the socs' direction. However, this is all shattered by two events: 1) the Socs are still looking for them and 2) Johnny is dying. This leads up to a startling, heartbreaking conclusion that will stay with you forever.This film is excellent. The cast, for starters is superb, Ralph Maccio's performance as Johnny is definitley the most affecting, but the rest of the cast works wonders as well. Matt Dillon is convincing and often hilarious as Dallas, a troublemaker with a good heart. Diane Lane gives what is her best role to date as Cherry. And C. Thomas Howell is superb as ponyboy. Other notable faces, Patrick Swayze is tough yet sensitive as Ponyboy's brother Darrell, angry at the fact that he has to put his life on hold to raise Ponyboy. Rob Lowe is great as Sodapop, who I recall was Johnny's brother. Emilio Estevez's Two-Bit and Tom Cruise's Stev sort of float through the film, but they still turn in credible performances.As I said, I don't own this special edition, but the extras look incredible and I look forward to getting it for Christmas.",5,"New Special Edition Tkaes You Inside ""The Outsiders"".",1130544000,"10 29, 2005",2005,2793,"['Firstly', 'let', 'just', 'state', 'how', 'glad', 'am', 'learn', 'Outisders', 'finally', 'available', 'special', 'edition', 'dvd', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'forever', 'film', 'now', 'Christmas', 'list.Secondly', 'let', 'state', 'one', 'best', 'films', '1980s', 'Most', 'films', 'decade', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'aged', 'well', 'one', 'not', 'lost', 'anything', 'directed', 'cinematic', 'legend', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'legacy', 'timeless', 'maybe', 'novle', 'based', 'remained', 'classic', 'maybe', 'most', 'film', 'stars', 'are', 'still', 'famous', 'today', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'example.The', 'film', 'place', 'Tulsa', '1966', 'Back', 'then', 'teenagers', 'were', 'devided', 'two', 'groups', 'one', 'end', 'spectrum', 'Greasers', ""'re"", 'soc', 'come', 'poor', 'side', 'town', ""'ve"", 'been', 'rejected', 'society', 'outsider', 'other', 'end', 'Socs', ""'re"", 'soc', ""'re"", 'rich', 'have', 'money', 'cars', 'women', ""'re"", 'respected', 'feared', 'movie', 'theater', 'one', 'night', 'Greasers', 'Ponyboy', 'C.', 'Thomas', 'Howell', 'Johnny', 'Ralph', 'Maccio', 'hook', 'up', 'Soc', 'Cherry', 'Diane', 'Lane', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'Cherry', 'aggressive', 'boyfriend', 'Bob', 'Lief', 'Garret', ""c'mon"", 'remember', 'who', 'two', 'will', 'have', 'nothing', 'more', 'do', 'Cherry', 'When', 'walk', 'park', 'Bob', 'group', 'socs', 'dead', 'Ponyboy', 'Johnny', 'have', 'skip', 'town', 'avoid', 'law', 'help', 'resourceful', 'friend', 'Dallas', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Ponyboy', 'Johnny', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'lamb', 'three', 'become', 'local', 'heros', 'when', 'resuce', 'young', 'children', 'schoolfire', 'Johnny', 'seriously', 'inujured', 'Old', 'feuds', 'are', 'put', 'rest', 'everything', 'be', 'turning', 'socs', 'direction', 'However', 'shattered', 'two', 'events', '1', 'Socs', 'are', 'still', 'looking', '2', 'Johnny', 'dying', 'up', 'startling', 'heartbreaking', 'conclusion', 'will', 'stay', 'forever.This', 'film', 'excellent', 'cast', 'starters', 'superb', 'Ralph', 'Maccio', 'performance', 'Johnny', 'definitley', 'most', 'affecting', 'rest', 'cast', 'wonders', 'as', 'well', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'convincing', 'often', 'hilarious', 'Dallas', 'troublemaker', 'good', 'heart', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'what', 'best', 'role', 'date', 'Cherry', 'C.', 'Thomas', 'Howell', 'superb', 'ponyboy', 'Other', 'notable', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'tough', 'yet', 'sensitive', 'Ponyboy', 'brother', 'Darrell', 'angry', 'fact', 'put', 'life', 'hold', 'raise', 'Ponyboy', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'great', 'Sodapop', 'who', 'recall', 'was', 'Johnny', 'brother', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'Two-Bit', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Stev', 'sort', 'float', 'film', 'still', 'turn', 'credible', 'performances.As', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'special', 'edition', 'extras', 'look', 'incredible', 'look', 'forward', 'getting', 'Christmas']",N/A

The only reason why I chose not to pit The Outsiders in the bottom is because of Matt Dillon's performance. The Outsiders reeked bad acting, nonsensical story, and absolutely no plot whatsoever. It builds up to a monumental fight at the end, and then again, the fight never seemed to be a monumental one anyway. It's like the fight started, and then the rain poured just like that. I'll have to say, it is an incredibly stupid scene. The screenplay is badly written and contrived, allowing the ""socs"" and ""greasers"" to elevate themselves to the highest level of corniness they could possibly maintain. To this day, I've always felt a sharp crawl on my skin whenever I see Ralph Macchio and C. Thomas Howell in movies, but seeing both at the same time for this particular film is a major pain for me. It's a good thing both of them saw their fame to wither away so fast over the years that I could barely remember either of them today. Back to The Outsiders, again, there is nothing to substantiate about this film, so it basically becomes a showcase of Matt Dillon's acting skills, which I quite enjoyed it quite immensely. Although corny but wonderful, Matt Dillon spoke the infamous lines, after in a deep thought with a silly switchblade knife, ""Let's do it for Johnny, man. We'll do it for Johnny!"" I'll admit, aside from that hysterical moment, Matt Dillon gave a very sharp performance, which helped him to be well-conditioned for the next S.E. Hinton's film Rumble Fish. All in all, so much for The Outsiders for being blatantly homosexual when it was originally suggested as a ""tough guy"" picture.7/13: I've finally picked up the book and read it for the first time. I actually like the book a lot more than I do with the movie. Of course, I visualized the actors for each role except that I had Emilio Estevez for Sodapop. I don't see Rob Lowe as anyone. Tom Cruise seems to be out of place in the film. As for the movie, I see clearly why the film failed; it only highlighted the pivotal points of the book and nothing else. The movie was already bad regardless. The acting and the cheesiness are too much for me to take. Then again, I would watch it for Matt Dillon's performance which deserved any accolade. He was the only one of any actor to actually show emotions and feelings; that's why his was an endearing character to watch. Of course, he believed enough in S.E. Hinton's material that he was the only one to star in all of her three main films. All in all, The Outsiders is worth watching for Matt Dillon's sake.",1,Corny in a Bad Way.

235771,A2FNA5903D9E6Y,6300270033,Carol Toscano,"[1, 1]","The Outsiders has been one of my favorite films since it first opened in the early 80's.  The main differences between this new version (which, really, is not new) are the reinstated scenes and the score of the film making it truer to the book.  If I had to choose which version I prefer, I think the new version would win - more for the addition of the cut scenes than for the music (although, the music in the new version is particular to the period and works well).  The Outsiders - The Complete Novel covers pretty much everything in S.E. Hinton's amazing novel - the additions, especially at the beginning of the film, make a big difference to the overall experience of it.  Other added scenes include some tender moments between the two brothers (Pony Boy and Soda Pop Curtis played by C. Thomas Howell and Rob Lowe) that Mr. Coppola cut because of how those situations might have been perceived at the time of the original release.  Rob Lowe really shines in this new version since he was central in a good portion of the reinstated material.  I own both versions of this and appreciate both for their own merits.  I think that the original score of the film (the orchestral score written by Mr. Coppola's father) gives that version a different feel altogether.  I like both, actually.  In a way, it's like they are two separate films.  The good thing about the new version is that is doesn't have the old version included but instead has some very good bonus material about the making of The Outsiders and some reunion footage that was filmed for the new version.Visually, this film is exquisite - every frame is a beautiful portrait full of small details that complete a picture (like the scene of Dallas in the hospital declaring ""We'll do it for Johnny!""  We see Dallas's back to us but his necklace is hanging backwards down his back exactly how it really happens.  But, the most beautiful scenes are those of Pony Boy and Johnny in the sunset discussing Robert Frost (think Scarlet O'Hara in Gone With The Wind vowing never to be hungry again...as God as her witness...darnit!):Nature's first green is goldHer hardest hue to holdHer early leaf's a flowerBut only so an hourAmazing for the time, this film proved that tenderness, love, loyalty, heroism, pain and loss existed (exists still) in young boys (contrary to societal views and gender programming norms).  How many directors would have tackled that in the early 80s?  Also worth noting is the limited to almost no use of profanity and no sex scenes (it's implied but not central). And it still works!  Who knew?  You don't see much of that in films today about teenaged boys.One final note - I think the performances that Mr. Coppola extracted from these young men was astonishing.  I don't think I've ever seen any of them (except for Matt Dillon who seemed to be especially thoughtful about his future career choices - well maybe there were a couple of dogs along the way but definitely see The Saint of Ft. Washington) quite capture that magic in the same way in subsequent roles - Ralph Macchio and Matt Dillon in particular give very strong performances here.  If you only buy one DVD this year, this is the one.  It's a masterpiece.",5,"""Let's do it for Johnny, man!

235772,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6300270033,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","The Outsiders, based on the novel by H.E. Hinton, and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is an awesome film. Though the novels of H.E. Hinton are targeted to a teen age demographic, they are somewhat deeper than the average teenster fodder. They are deep, with characters that are at once greasers, and sensitive enough to quote Robert Frost poems by heart. Then there are the socs (pronounced so-shuz), the rich kids who attend social gatherings at the country club, when they're not drunkenly water boarding much smaller greaser kids that they outnumber two-to-one. The socs are not all bad, though. For instance Cherry Vance (Diane Lane) is not only scorchingly hot, she has a soft spot for Ponyboy Curtis (C. Thomas Howell), and would almost fall for his friend, Dallas (Matt Dillon) if he wasn't such a jerk.Ponyboy has the soul of a poet in the body of a greaser. See Thomas Howl. Howl, Thomas, howl. It is amazing how well he carries the film when you consider all the young talent this film is packed with: Tom Cruise, Matt Dillon, Diane Lane, Rob Lowe (as Ponyboy's brother, Soda Pop, in his film debut), Emilio Esteves, Patrick Swayze, Tom Waits, and Ralph Macchio. While Howell is the lead, Ralph, as Johnny, is a close second. He is just a kid, but he's a young kid with an old soul. Though you might say that the other actors I mentioned all went on to bigger and better things, this may have been the zenith of Howell and Macchio's career. It is like the Robert Frost Poem that Ponyboy quotes:Nature's first green is gold,Her hardest hue to hold.Her early leaf's a flower;But only so an hour.Then leaf subsides to leaf.So Eden sank to grief,So dawn goes down to day.Nothing gold can stay.Or, in the last words of Johnny to Ponyboy, ""Stay Gold.""That was also the title to a great song that Stevie Wonder wrote for the film. It is a great Wonder ballad, with orchestration that may have been provided by Francis' brother Carmine, who did the music. Carmine Coppola was the dean of the Art Department when I went to San Francisco State--quite a flamboyant character who affected purple velvet capes, like he was some kind of Art Vampire. He was also Nicolas Cage's father. Another Coppola factoid is that Sofia Coppola played the young street urchin who tried to spare change Dally, Ponyboy, and Johnny.Bottom Line is that The Outsiders is an amazing film that combines lyrical moments with the dramatic intensity of a clash of cultures: Greasers Vs. Socs.

235775,A2QZQBINBG6B5N,6300270033,Charles S. Houser,"[7, 9]","As evidenced in the many versions of APOCALYPSE NOW and THE GODFATHER (I, II, and III), Francis Ford Coppola never stops fussing his movies. With the release of THE OUTSIDERS: THE COMPLETE NOVEL, Coppola has restored 22 minutes (mostly prologue) to his 1983 all-star teen hit. What do these extra minutes add to the film? Well, you could say the relationship of the three Curtis brothers (played by Swayze, Lowe, and Howell) is more sharply defined.  Interestingly, in the original version it was the middle child (Lowe's Sodapop Curtis) who got pushed to the margins. In the new version with restored footage, viewers get to see quite a bit of this Emmy award winning actor's earliest screen acting. One key scene, a bedtime conversation between Lowe and Howell was cut, according to Coppola's commentary, because it caused snickering in previews. While it is interesting to watch and although it certainly provided information helpful to understanding the brothers' relationship, even the original theatrical version of THE OUTSIDERS did not lack for scenes of fraternal tenderness. In fact, many of the cut scenes involved one or another of the male characters breaking down and having some kind of confessional confrontation with his feelings. These guys are supposed to be ""greasers"" after all. Having fewer emotional displays actually makes the few that remain all the more impactful.The other big change was the virtual jettisoning of Coppola pere's lush, ""Hollywoody"" score, and its replacement with sizeable chunks of the early Elvis catalog. Coppola had originally conceived of THE OUTSIDERS as a sort of teen GONE WITH THE WIND, and it worked. The addition of long stretches of rockabilly music, to my ear, was distracting, and at times it even undermined key dialogue.Do I prefer the original OUTSIDERS to THE COMPLETE NOVEL version? Yes. Do I regret buying THE COMPLETE NOVEL version? Absolutely not! There are so many delightful extras on this two-disk set. Almost all of the stars, most of whom have gone on to do great things, provided interview clips and/or commentary (notably missing were Emilio Estevez and Tom Cruz, who had smaller parts, anyway). One of my favorite extras was the tour of Tulsa given by S.E. Hinton, the author of the bestselling young adult novel the movie was based on. Also fun to watch were tapes from the original auditions, including footage of people who didn't make it into the movie.

For about a year I searched for this movie, and when I finally got it,I watched it right away. What a dissapointment. The whole first chapter was cut out (most important: it explained each of the carictors, why Johny was so scared, how Pony was beat up and the rivaly between the groups), as for the tension between Ponyboy and his oldest brother Darry and the love with his other brother, Sodapop. Also, the parts with Sodapop and Sandy were cut out,the court scene, and the fact that Soda dropped out of school wasn't mentioned, as long as other stuff that were important to the plot and could have made the story better.  I was surpirised by the cast, though. Matt Dillon was the best, as Dally, the tough hood. Dally and Sodapop (Rob Lowe) were just as I pictured them while reading the book. They were great, but Rob Lowe wasn't shown enough. The others were also good.The opening credits also dragged. Watching it at night, it nearly put me to sleep. And the scene with the &quot;Stay Gold&quot; poem seemed as though they tried too hard to make it seem touching, what with all that sob-sob music and all.If this was any other movie I'd have given it two stars.

235778,AENI3U0Z7UJBH,6300270033,Christine Lee,"[1, 2]","This little film of Francis Ford Coppola's creative hands helped launch the careers of practically everyone in it. As if anyone could have imagined the impact that these actors were going to have on the film industry, men such as Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, Matt Dillon. And there was some guy who called himself Tom Cruise in it too.(Who in the hell is he?!)Based on the novel by S.E Hinton of the same title, it tells the story of three young boys by the names of Dally, Johnny and Ponyboy, and the nightmarish events of a hellish night. It all begins innocently enough with three friends going to a movie, Dally tries to impress a girl who happens to be a Soc (ie. rich girl) who in turn rejects his advances. She, and her own female friend in turn strike up a friendship with Ponyboy and Johnny after they stop Dally from harrassing her further, much to the anger and annoyance of her rich boyfriend.After Ponyboy gets into trouble for coming home too late from the movie, he and Johnny sit and wait in the park. But therein more trouble awaits them, the boyfriends of the two girls that Pony and Johnny befriended have tracked them, now they are looking to teach them a lesson about greasers not being fit to speak to Soc girls. During a scuffle Johnny accidentally kills the ringleader of the Soc boys, in desperation he and Pony flee from town, with the help of Dally.This was a story about trying to fit in, Pony is a smart and sensitive boy, who really doesn't deserve to be labelled as a no-good 'greaser'. But he is called that because his family don't have money, or prospects as far as society is concerned. It is also a story about the strength of friendship, and about brotherhood.If you're looking just to see Rob Lowe or Tom Cruise, you will be disappointed, because they are not in this film that much. For those of you familiar with the novel, it will help you understand the book better, thought you may think the ending as rather abrupt (which it is).The lack of special features is not really surprising, after all, this is known as Coppola's 'sleeper' film.

I find it hard to believe that Francis Ford Coppola would allow a movie studio to force him to cut out scenes to make the movie shorter which is what I understood happened. I don't blame Rob Lowe and the movie fans for being unhappy about the original scenes being cut out. The movie makes a lot more sense with the deleted scenes put back in. The music is also better.I also really enjoyed hearing the commentaries from the actors. I was disappointed that Emilio Estevez and Tom Cruise (for whatever reasons) did not participate in the commentaries. I loved all the bonus features. It was cool to see the young actors, including the ones who didn't make it into the film, audition. I only wish all the actors had been together to do the commentary, as Rob Lowe and Matt Dillon are recorded separately.This new version is amazing and should be re-released in the theatres. I did notice, though, that there were a couple of scenes that were added in that were not even in the book. That's the only flaw I guess I would point out is that Coppola should have stuck to the book instead of adding scenes such as the courtroom scene which is dragged out into more of a trial as if Ponyboy was on trial for murder. In the book it seemed to me that the courtroom scene was really just to decide if Ponyboy should be able to continue to live with his older brothers. Also the scene near the end where Cherry snubs Ponyboy at school totally contradicted what I thought they had overcome through the whole ordeal. And it wasn't even in the book.All in all, this is definitely worth having. I just wanted to see more of the actors' auditions and learn who all did try out. They mentioned some such as Dennis Quaid, Mickey Rourke and Val Kilmer but I wanted to know EVERYONE who was there auditioning!

235782,A2RAJ0QJYQ1CGY,6300270033,Colin,"[5, 7]","This review is going to compare the book to the movieThe Outsiders, the book and the movie are about gangs and clich&eacute;s. In The Outsiders your either a Soc or a Greaser. A Soc is a rich kid, Socs have fancy cars and nice homes. While Greasers have live in poor environments, beat up cars and don't make much money. The story about The Outsiders is mainly about Ponyboy and the previous events before a great big rumble that takes place between the Socs and the Greasers. The book and the movie both have the same plot, but some of the events are left out or have been changed.Some points in the movie were shot very accurate to the book. Like the Robert Sheldon murder (or you could call it when they whacked off poor Bob) That part was almost exactly like I imagined it in the book. The actor that played Dally performed him very well. Dally was the same cocky, tough, young, handsome and reckless greaser that was described in the book. When Dally was running across the lot away from the police, I thought that Coppola did that part beautifully. Again it was as though I was reading the book. Same exact pictures, it was so close to what I imagined it was scary.There are some things in the movie that I thought were different in the book. Like they left out Ponyboy being jumped in the beginning, the court hearing, Ponyboy and Johnny jumping off the train, they changed the part where Randy and Ponyboy talk and they also left out the teacher giving Ponyboy the school report. There was one more thing that really bothered me, all of the Greasers and Soc's looked like they were in their mid/ late twenties. I mean the book described everyone as high school aged kids and early twenties.I thought that movie and the book were both well done, and of course the book is better than the movie. The movie could be edited so that it is more like the book, only by adding in parts. I would also change some of the actors so they don't look like old people I mean god. It would be better if they were young kids, and looked like young reckless kids.

He has put back in 22 more minutes, most noticeably at the beginning and end of the movie. This new footage opens up the film more. We are introduced to the greasers much earlier on now that Coppola isn't reigned in by the dictates of test screenings. He is able to take the time to immerse the audience in this richly textured world shot in glorious widescreen by Stephen Burum who adopts a look that evokes another epic about troubled youth, Rebel Without A Cause (1955). The film is drenched in the golden hues of warm sunrises and sunsets like something right out of Gone with the Wind (1939).Another significant change has Coppola replacing all of his father's beautiful, classical score in favour of period rock `n' roll music. In some cases, like the opening scene where Ponyboy is jumped by some Socs, it works and in others, like the whimsical surf music that plays over the scene where the Socs jump Johnny and Ponyboy, it feels awkward and out of place. Part of the film's original charm was its moments of `50s style melodrama, as epitomized by the film's orchestral soundtrack, and this diminished by the newly inserted period music that could be right out of an episode of Crime Story. Hinton's books are timeless with their universal themes and the original music reflected that. This new music, while accurate for its time period, contributes to a loss of some of the timeless feel.On the first DVD is an audio commentary with director Francis Ford Coppola. He addresses the changes in the soundtrack by saying that after all these years he wanted to move away from a score that commented on what was happening to music that the characters would actually be listening to. The filmmaker delivers another top notch commentary full of smart observations and talks at length about why he prefers this cut.There is an additional commentary featuring Diane Lane, Ralph Macchio, Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Rob Lowe and Matt Dillon. Coppola invited all of them back to see this new cut of the film with Lowe and Dillon recorded separately. This is an entertaining track that fans will love. It's great to hear these actors talk about this movie after all these years.The second disc kicks things off with a retrospective look at the movie, entitled, ""Stay Gold: A Look Back at The Outsiders."" In a nice touch, we see Lane, Macchio, Swayze and Howell being reunited with Coppola at his ranch where they recorded their commentary.

235788,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,6300270033,David Anderson,"[2, 3]","""The Outsiders"", released in 1983, is a great film for all teenagers and adults to enjoy.  It stars upcoming stars Patrick Swayze, Matt Dillon, C. Thomas Howell, Tom Cruise, Emilio Estevez, and others.  This touching film tackles a variety of issues dealing with 1960's teen life.  It explores a group of friends called ""the greasers"" who search for belonging.  Many in their community misunderstand them, calling themselves delinquents.  Meanwhile, their rival group called the ""socialists"" try to erase their existance.  Instead, one of them is killed by one of the ""greasers"" in self-defense.  This begins a life journey not just between two boys but within the entire group.  They find their true sense of brotherhood and inner wellness.Five-time Oscar winning director and writer Francis Ford Coppola (""The Godfather"" series) gives great homage to S.E. Hilton's book version of the same name.  Though some important details are changed or eliminated from the book version, this film keeps the momentum.  This portrays many truths of those times.  The brutal fights and actions in this film express the harshness of life as an outsider of those times.  Behind the ""greasers'"", misbehaving, it maintains their trueness as good people inside.  Within this journey, the emotional aspect lingers within the storyline.  Few other teenage films have such a strong impact as ""The Outsiders"" (""Stand By Me"" [1985], ""Mean Girls"" [2004]).Some of the camera and visual effects add to the 1960's theme.  Various scenes digitally add the brighter colors that made this film appear as an actual 1960's classic melodrama.  One scene in particular vaguely resembles Scarlett O'Hara's ""I will never go hungry again"" scene in ""Gone With the Wind"".  These add a unique addition to this film.  Some may say that this explores a deeper sense of the characters' inner emotions and thoughts.  Regardless, this undoubtedly gives audiences unique surprises.  This effect is also seen on ""Far From Heaven"", released in 2002.The performers express the emotional aspect to this film beautifully.  Through frustration, fear, irateness, sadness, and loss, they maintain their posture through their individual characters.  Particular intense scenes stretch their abilities as actors wonderfully, namely the fight and the murder.  Performances from Matt Dillon and Patrick Swayze stand out.  The combination of young talents is a rare and amazing find.  Such acting quality proves their worth as upcoming stars.Those looking for a quality teen film should watch ""The Outsiders"".

235815,AEV640MKB3I9J,6300270033,Hank Drake,"[6, 7]","It has become increasingly popular in recent years for directors to revisit their earlier films and make revisions.  This can range from the minor tinkering for the DVD editions of Star Trek: The Motion Picture or the first Superman movie, to radical rethinkings such as the directors edition of Dances With Wolves.  Francis Ford Coppola, following the latter course, has now released a dramatically different version of his 1983 film The Outsiders.I missed the film in its original release, and first saw it on video.  I hadn't yet read the novel, so I had no preconceptions about the faithfullness of the adaptation.  Later, I  read the book and wondered why certain scenes were deleted, since the original cut of the film was rather short.  Yet even the theatrical version was a very moving experience.In his commentery, Coppola states that he removed about 20 minutes of footage under pressure from studio execs who wanted to tighten the film.  He has gone back and restored pretty much every scene he shot.  Most of the restored footage, some of which has been seen on TV presentations, greatly adds to the characters and the story.  It should never have been excised.  This is especially true of about ten minutes of footage at the beginning of the film, which gives the background for the Curtis brothers.Carmine Coppola, the director's father, wrote a symphonic score for the original version.  The score for the new version consists mostly of popular tunes, which serves to date the movie--which has timeless themes.  Worse, by deleting most of his father's score, Coppola dilutes the impact of numerous scenes, particularly the Socs' attempt to drown Ponyboy, the Sunrise scene, and the death of Dallas.  It would have been preferable if the director had made available an expanded version of the film with the original score.  Coppola, for a reason I can't fathom, has also changed the visuals for the opening credits--although thankfully he's kept Stay Gold as sung by Stevie Wonder.The cast without exception give committed performances--there's not one moment of bad acting in the entire film.  The DVD transfer is immaculate, pefectly capturing Coppola's Gone With the Wind inspired cinematography.  The bonus features are outstanding, including audition and rehearsal tapes, a making of featurette, and author S. E. Hinton hosting a present-day tour of several of the locations used during filming.",4,A Timeless Story,1132012800,"11 15, 2005",2005,2414,"['become', 'increasingly', 'popular', 'recent', 'years', 'directors', 'revisit', 'earlier', 'films', 'make', 'revisions', 'can', 'range', 'minor', 'tinkering', 'DVD', 'editions', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'first', 'Superman', 'movie', 'radical', 'rethinkings', 'such', 'directors', 'edition', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'following', 'latter', 'course', 'now', 'released', 'dramatically', 'different', 'version', '1983', 'film', 'Outsiders.I', 'missed', 'film', 'original', 'release', 'first', 'saw', 'video', 'had', ""n't"", 'yet', 'read', 'novel', 'had', 'preconceptions', 'faithfullness', 'adaptation', 'Later', 'read', 'book', 'wondered', 'why', 'certain', 'scenes', 'were', 'deleted', 'original', 'cut', 'film', 'was', 'rather', 'short', 'even', 'theatrical', 'version', 'was', 'very', 'moving', 'experience.In', 'commentery', 'Coppola', 'removed', '20', 'minutes', 'footage', 'pressure', 'studio', 'execs', 'who', 'wanted', 'tighten', 'film', 'gone', 'back', 'restored', 'pretty', 'much', 'scene', 'Most', 'restored', 'footage', 'been', 'seen', 'TV', 'presentations', 'greatly', 'characters', 'story', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'excised', 'especially', 'true', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'footage', 'beginning', 'film', 'background', 'Curtis', 'brothers.Carmine', 'Coppola', 'director', 'father', 'wrote', 'symphonic', 'score', 'original', 'version', 'score', 'new', 'version', 'mostly', 'popular', 'tunes', 'date', 'movie', 'timeless', 'themes', 'Worse', 'deleting', 'most', 'father', 'score', 'Coppola', 'impact', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'Socs', 'attempt', 'drown', 'Ponyboy', 'Sunrise', 'scene', 'death', 'Dallas', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'preferable', 'director', 'had', 'made', 'available', 'expanded', 'version', 'film', 'original', 'score', 'Coppola', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fathom', 'also', 'changed', 'visuals', 'opening', 'credits', 'thankfully', 'kept', 'Stay', 'Gold', 'sung', 'Stevie', 'Wonder.The', 'cast', 'exception', 'give', 'committed', 'performances', 'not', 'one', 'moment', 'bad', 'acting', 'entire', 'film', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'immaculate', 'pefectly', 'capturing', 'Coppola', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'inspired', 'cinematography', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'outstanding', 'including', 'audition', 'rehearsal', 'tapes', 'making', 'featurette', 'author', 'S.', 'E.', 'Hinton', 'hosting', 'present-day', 'tour', 'several', 'locations', 'used', 'filming']",N/A

While I've always loved the film, I was quite aware that many scenes had been shot but not used in the film.  The new beginning introduces the characters and establishes their relationship with one another early on.  The new ending (sans the scene at the high school) actually did air on network television back in 1987 and that is the version I've watched ever since.  Having it all together on DVD is a true wonder.The new soundtrack is going to take some getting used to it.  The Elvis songs work on every level, and the surfer music definitely works in certain scenes but not all of them.  The new music tends to make the film more comparable to the JD films of the 1950's and that is OK by me, because as far as I'm concerned this is the best of the genre.Even more wonderful than the new footage in the film are the extras! The documentary, auditions, tour of Tulsa with S.E. Hinton, and ""additional scenes"" are true treasures to own.A few things to take note of; There is approximately 2 minutes of footage of Johnny Cade and Ponyboy Curtis in the church that is no longer in the movie, but it does appear in the ""additional scenes"" section.  Also, I'm quite positive there was footage shot of Sodapop Curtis and his girlfriend Sandy as I remember seeing photos of him talking to her on a porch.  In the book she moves away and a letter Soda sent her returns unopened, which prompts his outburst at the dinner table near the end.  This probably should have been included in the ""additional scenes"" section too.  That storyline was later used in 'The Outsiders' TV series in 1990.I have no intention of getting rid of my original version of THE OUTSIDERS, but I forsee that this new special edition will be the one I view most often!

I thought to myself, well, maybe there  is something worthwile about this film which I just didn't quite get  then.Time passed, and a couple of weeks ago I noticed that the film was  finally coming out on DVD (and at a bargain basement price at that!) and so  I decided to order it.  Needless to say, it was a truly worthwile  rediscovery for me.  The film's overall theme of transcending barrers  imposed by society (both social and psychological) came out clearly through  the commendable performances of everyone, but C. Thomas Howell / Pony Boy  in particular.I never did quite get it back then - how come there  weren't too many fight scenes?  Why did they have to dampen an otherwise  euphoric sensation of victory on the part of the Greasers (after the  climactic fight scene) by killing off Matt Dillon?  Now I understand that  that was exactly the whole point - showing that there is a better way, and  that, for Pony Boy, &quot;staying gold&quot; would undeniably be the best  decision he would be making in his life. Excellent, excellent film !WHY  ONLY 4 STARS?  Simple: the film/story/quality is great, but I really expect  more from a DVD, especially new releases.  What, no featurette? No  commentary?  They couldn't even get one interview out of the numerous stars  in the film in?  Come on!

235827,AD94D0QMN6A6G,6300270033,jblyn,"[5, 5]","I wasn't sure what was going to occur when I plopped the 1st DVD containing the ""special edition"" of THE OUTSIDERS into my player and settled back to watch. I wasn't wild about APOCALYPSE REDUX, Francis Coppola's recutting of his classic APOCALYPSE NOW. On that one, I strongly felt that there were a LOT of good reasons why things were removed from the original version in the first place, and most if not all of them should never have been reinstated. Happily, this is not the case with THE OUTSIDERS. Here, Coppola has followed practically to the letter the plot threads of S.E. Hinton's original novel and, in so doing, given us a great movie in place of a good one.First of all, there is more of an established build-up of the characters and their setting. When Ponyboy Curtis, the ""greaser"" who is the primary character in the story, gets harassed and attacked by the ""socs"" on his way home from the movies and subsequently rescued by his fellow ""greasers,"" you get the picture of how things stand between the ""haves"" (the socs) and the ""have-nots"" (the greasers), plus you meet and get to know all of Ponyboy's inner circle right away; his two brothers Darry and Sodapop, Johnny, Dallas, Two-Bit, Steve and the rest. This goes a long way to giving the viewer much more empathy for what Ponyboy and Johnny go through, and it furnishes some pleasant surprises as well. Rob Lowe is an actor often dismissed as a lightweight, but this version of THE OUTSIDERS shows how good he really could be. As Sodapop, one of Ponyboy's two older brothers, Lowe shows a sympathy and depth as the middle brother trying to be conciliator between Darry and Ponyboy when they fight with one another. In fact, every single actor here gets further flexing of their wings in this version, and it works terrifically.However one feels about Coppola's father Carmine's original score, the replacing of most of it with 50s and 60s rock'n roll throughout the film dramatically changes the feel of it...to my mind, for the better. Coppola explains that his father's original score was there to give the film a ""Gone With The Wind"" texture, in keeping with the way the Margaret Mitchell novel surfaces throughout THE OUTSIDERS (movie AND book) as one thing that has an impact on Ponyboy and his friends and family. Fine as a theory, but that original score felt downright soupy at times, and it was a little like getting hit over the head with how SIGNIFICANT certain scenes were supposed to be rather than letting the audience figure that out. The rock 'n roll gives the movie more of a sensibility like BLACKBOARD JUNGLE and other ""misunderstood youth"" pictures of the 1950s and 1960s, and it works really, really well. It makes ""Stay Gold,"" the theme song by Carmine Coppola and Stevie Wonder, stand out just that much more at the start and end of the film.The abundance of extras on the 2nd DVD are mind-boggling and a treat for cineastes everywhere, but the main jewel in the crown is this restored movie, one that gives ""director's cut"" a good name.

The I read the book about a month later, and was surprised of how much was left out of the movie. Basically the movie skipped over Chapter 1 entirely and jumped from Dallas dying to Ponyboy reflecting on what had happened. Also I didn't know the benefits of the letterboxing format.When it was on CBS the first time, they did insert the scenes in the courtroom plus the final conversation between Ponyboy, Sodapop and Darry. It seemed a little better.When I finally heard that Francis Ford Coppola was going to revisit the film and release a new DVD I was extremely happy. When I purchased the DVD, it just blew me away.It was really like watching a full completed film. The characters were more completely realized and all the deleted scenes filled the missing gaps from the original cut. The transfer was excellent and sound was rich and full. FINALLY, I got to see the film in the original widescreen presentation.The extras on the film were fantastic as well. I've only listened to the audio commentary by the cast, but it was wonderfully done, blending Matt and Rob's solo commentary with the rest. I only wish Emilio and Tom were there. The retrospective was great and the auditions were a real eye opener: Anthony Michael Hall as Ponyboy?My only small complaint is the change of music. I enjoyed the original Carmine Coppola score. It was powerful and emotional. But it's his sons' movie and he does have the final say.Just a top notch recommendation all around. If you've think you've seen The Outsiders, buy this immediately.

This way I would paint the characters the way they appeared in my mind. Okay, so the book was the paperback version with the movie characters on the front, so I had a little help. But I have to say that when I watched the movie afterward, I was disappointed in what I saw. The acting was awful. Especially on the part of C. Thomas Howell. Before I saw the movie, I had no idea who C. Thomas Howell was. I only knew of the small picture of his face on the book. He being the main character in the story, I painted him as a totally different person. Howell is a goof. He has the warmth and charm of a cold toilet seat. Ralph Macchio wasn't as bad, but his acting skills were so much better in The Karate Kid, which came out only 1 year later. I liked him in KK pt. 1 (and only pt. 1) and nothing else. I think Matt Dillon gives the only true-to-the-book performance. Even though his character in the book is physically described different. Now for the new soundtrack... which is a soundtrack now and not a score. First of all, I have to say that I didn't like the original score to begin with. Maybe it was supposed to give the movie a 1960's feeling, but I found it too cheesy. The new soundtrack is okay at times, but uncalled for in many scenes. I don't think it was necessary to have it throughout the whole movie, American Graffitti-like. It was also WAY too loud. I could barely hear the dialogue. The extra footage was fun to see, and the second disk was entertaining as well. (Diane Lane is STILL GORGEOUS) I find myself not wanting to watch the new version as much as I did the old one though.

A stab to Ponyboy's throat and a painful scar on Johnny's face increase the Greasers' hatred of the Socs, but no one is prepared for the wild ride that shows them a lot of things about themselves and their pals that they never knew.I loved this movie!

They have snobby  attitudes and do not think too highly of the greasers.  The greasers are  the tough kids.  The kids who are trying to make it on their own and do not  have the money to buy their way out of life's troubles.

As a result of the murder, Ponyboy ends up  talking with a soc and realizes that they are just like him.  They have  feelings and their own set of problems to deal with.

Still, it became a favorite among young people who could relate to the plight of the Greasers in their never-ending social war against the rich Socs. This version of the film includes much more of the film that was cut, helping to flesh out characters like Sodapop and Darry better and providing an insight into the genius of the book by S.E. Hinton.This film is a curiosity not only for the great story but because it features so many actors who went on to make names for themselves whether it be 80s stars like Patrick Swayze and Emilio Estevez or those whose career took off later like Rob Lowe and Tom Cruise. It is nice to see them in their youth when their acting was not as polished by Hollywood.This 2 disk DVD does not skimp on extra features. Besides the scenes that have been inserted in the film, there are other deleted scenes, a few from the original release that were replaced. There is a featurette about the making of the film which brings some of the old cast back together including C. Thomas Howell, Ralph Macchio, Patrick Swayze, and Diane Lane. There is also an interesting segment that shows audition footage of many of the cast captured by a very early tape recorder.The one downfall of this version of the film is the music. Coppola wanted to make the film a little more realistic by inserting music the boys would have really listened to instead of an ominous movie score.

It is a badly-acted badly-written and (dare I say) badly-directed.  Interesting it is, too, how many now-famous actors were in this movie 'way back' in the 80's.  Even so, a majority of them are very bad in this movie (take the infamous lead in the ""Karate Kid"").  See this movie depending on your feelings about the book (which I found OK; it's not nearly as captivating as everyone else says it is).

I decided to buy it after reading Rob Lowe's autobiography when he gushed about how good it was and how the extended version was the only one to see. Perhaps because I am not from the USA I do not understand the dynamics behind this story and group of young men but I found the movie to be really bad. I could not believe that Francis Ford Coppola directed this. It is certainly well below par and one of his worst efforts as far as I can see.. I agree with other reviewers that the music is jarring and seems to be inappropriate at times. The acting is below par too. I know that most of them were not that seasoned when this movie was made but with the exception of Ralph Macchio they are not that good. It appears to me that most of them seemed to be trying to do a James Dean ""Rebel without a cause"" characterisation  without his charisma or ability.Looking at Tom Cruise in this movie makes me cringe and brings to mind his appearance on Oprah when he did the couch jumping thing. I had little sympathy and connection with the characters...As played they were just a lot of testosterone filled young hoods filled with there own self importance and arrogance who went round looking for trouble...I was astonished at the end of the film that this is so popular....Maybe the book is better but after viewing this I won't be rushing to read it.",2,Not that good,1342137600,"07 13, 2012",2012,1521,"['have', 'never', 'read', 'novel', 'seen', 'movie', 'when', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'had', 'pre-concieved', 'notions', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'way', 'regards', 'book/versus', 'film', 'decided', 'buy', 'reading', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'autobiography', 'when', 'gushed', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'how', 'extended', 'version', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'see', 'Perhaps', 'am', 'not', 'USA', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'dynamics', 'story', 'group', 'young', 'men', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'really', 'bad', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'directed', 'certainly', 'well', 'par', 'one', 'worst', 'efforts', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'see..', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'music', 'jarring', 'be', 'inappropriate', 'times', 'acting', 'par', 'too', 'know', 'most', 'were', 'not', 'that', 'seasoned', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'exception', 'Ralph', 'Macchio', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'most', 'seemed', 'be', 'trying', 'do', 'James', 'Dean', 'Rebel', 'cause', 'characterisation', 'charisma', 'ability.Looking', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'movie', 'cringe', 'mind', 'appearance', 'Oprah', 'when', 'did', 'couch', 'jumping', 'thing', 'had', 'little', 'sympathy', 'connection', 'characters', 'played', 'were', 'just', 'lot', 'testosterone', 'filled', 'young', 'hoods', 'filled', 'own', 'self', 'importance', 'arrogance', 'who', 'went', 'round', 'looking', 'trouble', 'was', 'astonished', 'end', 'film', 'so', 'popular', '.Maybe', 'book', 'better', 'viewing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'rushing', 'read']",N/A

Hinton's novel for teenagers about teenagers, ""The Outsiders,"" was made into a movie for teenagers and starring teenagers by no less a director than Francis Ford Coppola, whose father Carmine composed the score. It was edited to fit theatre screening times, yet upon release the film busted no blocks, although it has had a following. All the actors in it were unknown. They aren't anymore. C. Thomas Howell (in the leading role), Matt Dillon, Diane Lane, Ralph Macchio, Rob Lowe, Patrick Swayze, Emilio Estevez and Tom Cruise --- ""The Outsiders"" launched their careers. Were they grateful? All but Cruise showed up for the extras on the second disc of this new DVD edition.For this ""Complete Novel"" version, Coppola replaced his father's score with period pop tunes (bad move) and restored key sequences. The story remains that of three brothers (Howell, Lowe, Swayze) and how they and their ""greaser"" friends deal with the taunts of roving rich kids. The new footage lengthens the film, raises the testosterone level, deepens the characters and explains their drive to survive on the wrong side of Tulsa's tracks. Before the inconclusive end, two will die but little will change in the others' lives.Among the new sequences is one introducing each of the youths as he responds to an attack on Howell; an intimate one in which two brothers cuddle and converse in bed; and Lowe's outburst of feeling to his brothers, the actor's finest moment here. Although it is now a better movie, it is not yet a cohesive one. Only one of the tormentors seems human, and adults do not register at all. Some of the scenes are strong and maybe that's enough, but they do not hang together. Hinton, her readers, and fans of the now-famous cast, however, will be satisfied.",4,Inside the Outsiders,1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,1762,"['S.', 'E.', 'Hinton', 'novel', 'teenagers', 'teenagers', 'Outsiders', 'was', 'made', 'movie', 'teenagers', 'starring', 'teenagers', 'less', 'director', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'father', 'Carmine', 'composed', 'score', 'was', 'edited', 'fit', 'theatre', 'screening', 'times', 'yet', 'release', 'film', 'busted', 'blocks', 'had', 'following', 'actors', 'were', 'unknown', 'are', ""n't"", 'anymore', 'C.', 'Thomas', 'Howell', 'leading', 'role', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Ralph', 'Macchio', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Outsiders', 'launched', 'careers', 'Were', 'grateful', 'Cruise', 'showed', 'up', 'extras', 'second', 'disc', 'new', 'DVD', 'edition.For', 'Complete', 'Novel', 'version', 'Coppola', 'replaced', 'father', 'score', 'period', 'pop', 'tunes', 'bad', 'move', 'restored', 'key', 'sequences', 'story', 'three', 'brothers', 'Howell', 'Lowe', 'Swayze', 'how', 'greaser', 'friends', 'deal', 'taunts', 'roving', 'rich', 'kids', 'new', 'footage', 'film', 'testosterone', 'level', 'characters', 'drive', 'survive', 'wrong', 'side', 'Tulsa', 'tracks', 'inconclusive', 'end', 'two', 'will', 'die', 'little', 'will', 'change', 'others', 'new', 'sequences', 'one', 'introducing', 'youths', 'attack', 'Howell', 'intimate', 'one', 'two', 'brothers', 'cuddle', 'converse', 'bed', 'Lowe', 'outburst', 'feeling', 'brothers', 'actor', 'finest', 'moment', 'here', 'now', 'better', 'movie', 'not', 'yet', 'cohesive', 'one', 'Only', 'one', 'tormentors', 'human', 'adults', 'do', 'not', 'register', 'scenes', 'are', 'strong', 'maybe', 'enough', 'do', 'not', 'hang', 'together', 'Hinton', 'readers', 'fans', 'now-famous', 'cast', 'however', 'will', 'be', 'satisfied']",N/A

This is a thought-provoking drama following the misfortunes of a teenage hood growing up in Tulsa in the early 1960s. The movie evokes (both thematically and stylistically) the memory of Terence Malick's Badlands, with its themes of childhood innocence interrupted by the reality of inhumanity, violence and injustice. Visually, the film has several original and interesting touches, making it uniquely filmic in its vision. The visual-stylistic nods to Gone with the Wind are a little pretentious and overdone ('nod' is an understatement), though the story has much in common with Margaret Mitchell's novel, to which the film makes reference: it is the tale of warring sides, and the efforts to find hope and meaning in the midst of conflict and loss.In general, characters and plot are nicely developed, though the character of Dally might have been sketched out in a little more detail; he appears grossly unsympathetic and unlikeable, whilst we get the feeling that we are supposed to identify with him somewhat. The young cast (chiefly made up of then unknowns who later went on to become successful actors, even stars) are mainly commendable: only occasionally do the two juvenile leads fail to convince, but even then it does not overly hamper their generally excellent performances. The musical score, by the director's daughter, Carmine Coppola, contains some effective moments, but equally a few puzzling moments, which really miss the markWhat makes the picture a success is the gripping tale that will  strike a chord with thoughtful viewers, a couple of touching performances, and a vital, highly visual storytelling style that overcomes the film's technical deficiencies.",4,Worth repeated viewings,1020556800,"05 5, 2002",2002,1809,"['easy', 'pick', 'film', 'technical', 'failings', 'Good', 'films', 'however', 'are', 'not', 'merely', 'technical', 'excellence', 'thought-provoking', 'drama', 'following', 'misfortunes', 'teenage', 'hood', 'growing', 'up', 'Tulsa', 'early', '1960s', 'movie', 'evokes', 'thematically', 'stylistically', 'memory', 'Terence', 'Malick', 'Badlands', 'themes', 'childhood', 'innocence', 'interrupted', 'reality', 'inhumanity', 'violence', 'injustice', 'Visually', 'film', 'several', 'original', 'interesting', 'touches', 'making', 'uniquely', 'filmic', 'vision', 'visual-stylistic', 'nods', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'are', 'little', 'pretentious', 'overdone', 'understatement', 'story', 'much', 'common', 'Margaret', 'Mitchell', 'novel', 'film', 'reference', 'tale', 'warring', 'sides', 'efforts', 'find', 'hope', 'meaning', 'midst', 'conflict', 'loss.In', 'general', 'characters', 'plot', 'are', 'nicely', 'developed', 'character', 'Dally', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'sketched', 'out', 'little', 'more', 'detail', 'grossly', 'unsympathetic', 'unlikeable', 'whilst', 'get', 'feeling', 'are', 'supposed', 'identify', 'somewhat', 'young', 'cast', 'chiefly', 'made', 'then', 'unknowns', 'who', 'later', 'went', 'become', 'successful', 'actors', 'even', 'stars', 'are', 'mainly', 'commendable', 'only', 'occasionally', 'do', 'two', 'juvenile', 'leads', 'fail', 'convince', 'even', 'then', 'not', 'overly', 'hamper', 'generally', 'excellent', 'performances', 'musical', 'score', 'director', 'daughter', 'Carmine', 'Coppola', 'effective', 'moments', 'equally', 'few', 'puzzling', 'moments', 'really', 'miss', 'picture', 'success', 'gripping', 'tale', 'will', 'strike', 'chord', 'thoughtful', 'viewers', 'couple', 'touching', 'performances', 'vital', 'highly', 'visual', 'storytelling', 'style', 'film', 'technical', 'deficiencies']",N/A
