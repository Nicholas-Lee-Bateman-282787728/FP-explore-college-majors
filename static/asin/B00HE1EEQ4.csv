1688057,APCPKFNRS5WXV,B00HE1EEQ4,Alex T,"[2, 2]","What is there left to say that hasn't been said of this movie? For those who haven't watched it, Pixar's Up is notable for its opening scenes that beautifully expresses the emotional heft the main character will carry for the rest of the movie. It's wistful, heartbreaking, and can compete with any 5 minutes of any other film - live action or not - as the most touching ever put onscreen. In almost typical Miyazaki fashion, the entirety of The Wind Rises achieves that same affect and poignancy.With that said, it will bring feelings out of you, simply put! That's not to say it's a depressing movie, but it's emotionally fulfilling on a level few animated films have been able to express (and to be honest, those few films are mostly Miyazaki films). As you watch the life of a Japanese man building aircrafts for his country and finding love, The Wind Rises does carry a somber tone due to the plain fact that this is Miyazaki's supposed last film. Rather than describing the plot in countless words, it's pivotal to just watch a Miyazaki movie - going into too much detail would spoil the experience of watching a Miyazaki movie! Expect the same childlike imagination and artistry you may have seen in any of his previous films.Personally, I agree with the common notion that this movie was made for adults, but it's not because there's any outlandish content (as a small note, the plot is historically set during a time in Japan as it prepares for WWII, but no war violence is shown). Like Pixar's Up, the main character, whose eyesight relegates him to engineering airplanes rather than flying them, hoists some hardships that aren't explicitly discussed for the audience. Even compared to live-action movies, people should know that there's very little being spoon-fed to them. Limited exposition appears in the dialogue, and the steady pace of the film will most likely bore kids. For that matter, the nostalgic build of The Wind Rises is just not suited for antsy children.For adults, however, this movie is simply beautiful, and a must-watch to break any premature expectations of an animated film. It won't give you any gimmicks in its storytelling or its many inspiring moments. It's that element of pure filmmaking that makes Miyazaki films so timeless. Of course, variations of that praise have been said of his works many times before. What's plainly left to say is to just watch it while you can. It just so happens that every aspect of the film reminds you that nothing lasts forever. But some types of nothing can feel endlessly great.",5,Remember the first 5 minutes of Up?

There is no greater animated filmmaker in the world than him--even counting the Pixar bunch--and one wants more. My wife and I just saw The Wind Rises. But despite its unquestioned beauty and thoughtfulness, I found it oddly unengaging, sometimes tedious. It unfolds at a glacial pace and even its fictionalized account of the great Japanese aircraft designer's personal life--with its emotional drama--did not move me in the least. The made-up romance was sickly sweet and transparently tearjerking--a love story uncomfortably like Love Story. The moral and ethical ramifications of Jiro's work were given only perfunctory attention. I never felt Jiro wrestling with what his beautiful machines might do (and did). He is a boy-man who never grows up, just keeps dreaming.

It's for kids!"" and bring them to the theater. Imagine their surprise when they figure out that this movie is biographical, about an ill-fated love affair and the man who designed Japan's ferocious ""Zeros,"" Mitsubishi's World War II fighter planes. Dialogue about ""extruded aluminum alloy"" and ""flush rivets"" for a ""smooth skin"" probably went right over the kids' heads, don't you think? This is just as well because the children won't automatically think of Pearl Harbor or the War in the Pacific.I was dismayed to discover that the version I attended was in English, so I'm afraid I missed a lot; I expected it to be in Japanese with subtitles. When I realized my mistake, it was too late to go to the lobby and ask for closed-caption glasses. Oh well... My companion filled me in as best she could afterwards.There were many ""name brands"" providing the English-speaking voices, but I'd rather talk about the characters:* Jir Horikoshi is our main character; we follow him from childhood, see how he is inspired to design airplanes by reading about an Italian aeronautical designer, his engineering studies and his demanding employment at Mitsubishi. (We also see some of the failures.)* Caprioni is the Italian designer. (He has wild dreams and a large family!)* Honj is Jir's friend and fellow employee at Mitsubishi. It is so satisfying to see two honorable gentlemen treat each other with respect.* Nahoko Satomi is the lovely (doomed) young woman our hero loves. Her illness was another aspect of the film that escaped the youngsters in the audience.* Kayo Horikoshi is our hero's sister; she was one of my favorites because she was in a perpetual snit, which masked her loving heart.We also have an impatient boss, a Swiss acquaintance, parents, military fellows, landladies and various other characters. (Miyazaki creates delicious characters whose movements are authentic and breathtakingly real.)To me, however, the main reason to watch this Oscar-nominated film (Best Animated Feature) is to admire the exquisite art work. Every frame deserves to be mounted on a wall somewhere. There is nothing quite like Hayao Miyazaki's meticulous work, whether he is writing the story, drawing the frames or directing the movie, he is one of a kind. His previous works include ""Spirited Away,"" ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" and ""Princess Mononoke.""This is PG-13; it includes no profanity, nudity, warfare or gunfights. We see the Great Kanto Earthquake which occurred in 1923, but again, no blood or horror. It includes a tuberculosis epidemic, but we mostly see patients wrapped snugly at a sanitorium. We also see heavy cigarette smoking because pretty much everyone smoked in the 30s and 40s, so that is a non-issue.See the amazing artwork!

This is reportedly his last film. The story revolves around Jiro Horikoshi, the real life designer of Japanese war planes from WW II. The movie is slower paced than your typical frenetically paced American made animated film. The Japanese, unlike Americans, do not consider animation to be in the exclusive domain of childrens entertainment(our loss). In this regard I don't believe it will hold the attention of children under 10. There's no talking animals or friendly aliens- it's a serious drama. I took my two teenage sons to see this. Having grown up on a steady diet of slick, fast paced Disney/Pixar animated films like Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, WALL-E they found this an interesting change of pace.The film, though slower paced, engages you with elaborately detailed animation(hand drawn)and the passionate and likable Jiro. We are introduced to Jiro as a young boy who is obsessed with airplanes. In beautiful dream sequences he meets his hero, Caproni, an Italian airplane designer. Watching Jiro on screen as he grows into manhood I realized that he exhibited characteristics we hope all our young men will aspire to - integrity, selflessness, honor, respect and empathy for others as well as an always respectful attitude towards women. And it's his love interest where the second half of the film will take us. And Jiro will stay committed to her despite the obstacles.As for the issue of military aggression by the Japanese, Jiro believed, some might say naively believed, that his airplane designs would be used only for defensive purposes, not as part of an arsenal of offensive weapons meant to intimidate and conquer other nations. As you'll see, Miyazaki, like most contemporary Japanese, has no nostaglia for the era when it's leaders took Japan into a self-destructive campaign of military expansion- in one scene you'll see the ambitous military generals depicted as idiotic and aggressive buffoons. I recommend this inspiring and beautifully rendered film to everyone from teens on up.",5,wonderful animation experience,1399420800,"05 7, 2014",2014,2127,"['got', 'introduced', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', ""'Spirited"", 'Away', 'then', 'worked', 'way', 'back', 'earlier', 'works', 'reportedly', 'last', 'film', 'story', 'Jiro', 'Horikoshi', 'real', 'life', 'designer', 'Japanese', 'war', 'planes', 'WW', 'II', 'movie', 'slower', 'paced', 'typical', 'frenetically', 'paced', 'American', 'made', 'animated', 'film', 'Japanese', 'Americans', 'do', 'not', 'consider', 'animation', 'be', 'exclusive', 'domain', 'childrens', 'entertainment', 'loss', 'regard', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'will', 'hold', 'attention', 'children', '10', 'talking', 'animals', 'friendly', 'aliens-', 'serious', 'drama', 'took', 'two', 'teenage', 'sons', 'see', 'Having', 'grown', 'up', 'steady', 'diet', 'slick', 'fast', 'paced', 'Disney/Pixar', 'animated', 'films', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'Incredibles', 'WALL-E', 'found', 'interesting', 'change', 'pace.The', 'film', 'slower', 'paced', 'elaborately', 'detailed', 'animation', 'hand', 'drawn', 'passionate', 'likable', 'Jiro', 'are', 'introduced', 'Jiro', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'obsessed', 'airplanes', 'beautiful', 'dream', 'sequences', 'hero', 'Caproni', 'Italian', 'airplane', 'designer', 'Watching', 'Jiro', 'screen', 'manhood', 'realized', 'exhibited', 'characteristics', 'hope', 'young', 'men', 'will', 'aspire', 'integrity', 'selflessness', 'honor', 'respect', 'empathy', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'always', 'respectful', 'attitude', 'towards', 'women', 'love', 'interest', 'where', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'will', 'take', 'Jiro', 'will', 'stay', 'committed', 'obstacles.As', 'issue', 'military', 'aggression', 'Japanese', 'Jiro', 'believed', 'might', 'say', 'naively', 'believed', 'airplane', 'designs', 'would', 'be', 'used', 'only', 'defensive', 'purposes', 'not', 'part', 'arsenal', 'offensive', 'weapons', 'meant', 'intimidate', 'conquer', 'other', 'nations', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Miyazaki', 'most', 'contemporary', 'Japanese', 'nostaglia', 'era', 'when', 'leaders', 'took', 'Japan', 'self-destructive', 'campaign', 'military', 'expansion-', 'one', 'scene', ""'ll"", 'see', 'ambitous', 'military', 'generals', 'depicted', 'idiotic', 'aggressive', 'buffoons', 'recommend', 'inspiring', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'film', 'everyone', 'teens']",The Wind Rises

He dreams of flying but, because he's nearsighted, decides to be a Japanese airplane designer. We observe his life from child to adulthood as he makes his dream plane and, in the process, falls in love with Naoko (Emily Blunt). Will Jiro create the beautiful plane or realize that the beauty he's seeking is right in front of him all along?The film is a work of art. Hayao Miyazaki (Director and Writer) creates unique color palettes and designs. Since the movie takes place in the sky, the animators go above and beyond to hand draw backgrounds and movements for the planes. We witness them majestically soaring through the skies and you feel as if you're with them. The voice acting is well done. I think they portrayed the characters and their relationships exceptionally well. Much of the film focuses on the romance between Naoko and Jiro. Their connection is both loving and tragic. The film was first released in Japan, so American voice-overs are dubbed over the animation and yes, it can be distracting. They confront actual events that happened in Japan, such as the Kanto earth-quake of 1923 and Japan entering the war. I love the truth in this film. It doesn't shy away from talking about the real issues that happened during this time.My favorite character is Mr.Caproni (Stanley Tucci) a historical Italian aircraft designer who is Jiro's mentor in his dreams. I enjoy Stanley's voice acting skills. He's one of those character actors who is fantastic at everything he does. The character himself is fascinating. He looks at aircraft not as a bringer of war, but a creator of dreams.My favorite scene is the last dream sequence, after Jiro goes through a life changing experience. This is one of those bitter sweet endings, where you don't know what to think at first. You just need to take it all in.The message in this film is, &#34;Sometimes the outcome to your dream is not always what you expect.&#34; Jiro spends his whole life wanting to make his aircraft, determined to do anything to fulfill his goal. After a few sacrifices, he realizes his potential but it's not what he expects. Mr. Caproni then asks him, &#34;Did you have a good ten years?&#34;I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 11 to 18-year-olds.

He also falls in love with a female that he met in his younger years. Last, but not least, Jiro is frequently shown interacting with one of the famous  airplane designers who first inspired him (sometimes through dreams).

This is not a slick Disney production in 3D with modern graphics, but a softer 2D watercolor piece. All of Miyazaki's movies use this style and it can be disappointing for some. I find it utterly beautiful.If you are familiar with Miyazaki, the important thing to note is that The Wind Rises is different in tone to all of his established classics. This is a movie set in the real world, and it tells the story of, Jiro Horikoshi, who designed Japanese fighter planes during the second world war. I was worried that the story might disappoint, as I love Miyazaki's fantasy worlds, but all of the magic was present.One thing I should mention immediately is that this is not a story that is likely to engage young children in the way that Ponyo, My Neighbor Totoro, or Kiki's Delivery Service did. The two main themes are Jiro's passion for his work, and his love for a woman. People usually expect something light and family-friendly from animated movies, but this one includes a heartbreaking death and feelings that the very young would probably not understand.Miyazaki uses a number of dream sequences to establish Jiro's passion for his career, so you'll see him walking along the wings of planes designed by his Italian hero, Caproni. Jiro gains experience by working in European countries, and we watch him and his friend develop their young careers.One of the most charming things in the film is Jiro's love for Nahoko. The two have a chance encounter on a train when he is a boy, and he ends up saving her and her mother when an earthquake devastates their surroundings. Again, these scenes might worry or confuse small children.The detail in the animation is incredible, despite the old-fashioned style. Miyazaki often puts in seemingly unnecessary detail, but it adds realism to the story. Watch the small stones rolling when someone jumps off a train and you'll understand what I mean. Another thing that adds to the depth of the story is Miyazaki's willingness to address issues that are rarely explored in the animated form. For instance, one major character suffers from tuberculosis, which afflicted Miyazaki's own mother from 1947 to 1955.I hope that I'm not persuading you to give this film a miss with all the dark subject matter. It's an incredibly beautiful story with characters you'll really care about. The English dub features an incredibly strong array of talent and it works wonderfully. When Frozen wins the Oscar in a few hours from the time of writing, I won't be surprised, but The Wind Rises is just about perfect and deserves to win.The story affected me deeply and I had to fight off tears in places. If I had been watching at home by myself, I would probably have been sobbing by the end. But that would be because of the extraordinary beauty present in the film and its characters, rather than true sadness.If this is to be Miyazaki's final film, it's a great way to end a magnificent career. I was totally engrossed for two hours, just as I have been in the vast majority of his other films over the years. The Wind Rises might be remembered as his Grave of the Fireflies, but that shouldn't prevent you from seeing it. It's further proof that animation can be important as well as entertaining.",5,Hayao Miyazaki's swan song is just about perfect,1393718400,"03 2, 2014",2014,3392,"['trailer', 'Wind', 'Rises', 'only', 'hints', 'film', 'secrets', 'look', 'are', 'completely', 'new', 'works', 'director', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'not', 'slick', 'Disney', 'production', '3D', 'modern', 'graphics', 'softer', '2D', 'watercolor', 'piece', 'Miyazaki', 'movies', 'use', 'style', 'can', 'be', 'disappointing', 'find', 'utterly', 'beautiful.If', 'are', 'familiar', 'Miyazaki', 'important', 'thing', 'note', 'Wind', 'Rises', 'different', 'tone', 'established', 'classics', 'movie', 'set', 'real', 'world', 'story', 'Jiro', 'Horikoshi', 'who', 'designed', 'Japanese', 'fighter', 'planes', 'second', 'world', 'war', 'was', 'worried', 'story', 'might', 'disappoint', 'love', 'Miyazaki', 'fantasy', 'worlds', 'magic', 'was', 'present.One', 'thing', 'should', 'mention', 'immediately', 'not', 'story', 'likely', 'engage', 'young', 'children', 'way', 'Ponyo', 'My', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'did', 'two', 'main', 'themes', 'are', 'Jiro', 'passion', 'work', 'love', 'woman', 'People', 'usually', 'expect', 'something', 'light', 'family-friendly', 'animated', 'movies', 'one', 'heartbreaking', 'death', 'feelings', 'very', 'young', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'understand.Miyazaki', 'number', 'dream', 'sequences', 'establish', 'Jiro', 'passion', 'career', ""'ll"", 'see', 'walking', 'wings', 'planes', 'designed', 'Italian', 'hero', 'Caproni', 'Jiro', 'gains', 'experience', 'working', 'European', 'countries', 'watch', 'friend', 'develop', 'young', 'careers.One', 'most', 'charming', 'things', 'film', 'Jiro', 'love', 'Nahoko', 'two', 'have', 'chance', 'encounter', 'train', 'when', 'boy', 'up', 'saving', 'mother', 'when', 'earthquake', 'surroundings', 'Again', 'scenes', 'might', 'worry', 'confuse', 'small', 'children.The', 'detail', 'animation', 'incredible', 'old-fashioned', 'style', 'Miyazaki', 'often', 'seemingly', 'unnecessary', 'detail', 'realism', 'story', 'Watch', 'small', 'stones', 'rolling', 'when', 'someone', 'train', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'what', 'mean', 'thing', 'depth', 'story', 'Miyazaki', 'willingness', 'address', 'issues', 'are', 'rarely', 'explored', 'animated', 'form', 'instance', 'one', 'major', 'character', 'suffers', 'tuberculosis', 'afflicted', 'Miyazaki', 'own', 'mother', '1947', '1955.I', 'hope', ""'m"", 'not', 'persuading', 'give', 'film', 'miss', 'dark', 'subject', 'matter', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'story', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'really', 'care', 'English', 'dub', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'array', 'talent', 'wonderfully', 'When', 'Frozen', 'Oscar', 'few', 'hours', 'time', 'writing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'Wind', 'Rises', 'just', 'perfect', 'win.The', 'story', 'affected', 'deeply', 'had', 'fight', 'off', 'tears', 'places', 'had', 'been', 'watching', 'home', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'sobbing', 'end', 'would', 'be', 'extraordinary', 'beauty', 'present', 'film', 'characters', 'rather', 'true', 'sadness.If', 'be', 'Miyazaki', 'final', 'film', 'great', 'way', 'end', 'magnificent', 'career', 'was', 'totally', 'engrossed', 'two', 'hours', 'just', 'have', 'been', 'vast', 'majority', 'other', 'films', 'years', 'Wind', 'Rises', 'might', 'be', 'remembered', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'should', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'seeing', 'further', 'proof', 'animation', 'can', 'be', 'important', 'as', 'well', 'entertaining']",The Wind Rises

The animation meets the very high standards we've come to expect of Studio Ghibli. Also, the imagery seems much more approachable than inSpirited AwayorPrincess Mononoke. I love those, and I love the rich references to Japanese traditional culture in them - but I don't understand even a quarter of those references, assuming I recognize them at all. The Wind Rises, while wholly Japanese, seems to offer fewer mysterious icons than those others.Then, throughout, the movie maintains a sense of wonder in the magic of flight, a theme that recurs throughout Miyazaki's work. And, in a Nerd Pride step that I enjoyed, he presented the engineers who create the aircraft as the workers of that magic - not the pilots who flew them, but the flying machines' creators. All this comes across in a fairly peaceful and non-threatening environment, so evenThe Wizard of Ozseems fierce and fearsome by comparison. If you have kids, that might matter.My problem, though, is that wartime Japan was hardly the Eden this movie seems to portray, and the warplanes created here wrought terrible destruction on all the Japanese fronts of WWII. Perhaps this was meant to be seen as if through the eyes of a child, unaware of those hard, adult truths - I have no way to know. In any case, I came away with the impression of having seen half of something, where the darker half had been carefully excised.-- wiredweird",4,Leaves many impressions,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,1490,"['First', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'done', 'doubt', 'Miyazaki', 'could', 'make', 'ugly', 'movie', 'tried', 'animation', 'very', 'high', 'standards', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'Also', 'imagery', 'much', 'more', 'approachable', 'inSpirited', 'AwayorPrincess', 'Mononoke', 'love', 'love', 'rich', 'references', 'Japanese', 'traditional', 'culture', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'even', 'quarter', 'references', 'assuming', 'recognize', 'Wind', 'Rises', 'wholly', 'Japanese', 'offer', 'fewer', 'mysterious', 'icons', 'others.Then', 'movie', 'sense', 'wonder', 'magic', 'flight', 'theme', 'Miyazaki', 'work', 'Nerd', 'Pride', 'step', 'enjoyed', 'presented', 'engineers', 'who', 'create', 'aircraft', 'workers', 'magic', 'not', 'pilots', 'who', 'flew', 'flying', 'machines', 'creators', 'across', 'fairly', 'peaceful', 'non-threatening', 'environment', 'evenThe', 'Wizard', 'Ozseems', 'fierce', 'fearsome', 'comparison', 'have', 'kids', 'might', 'matter.My', 'problem', 'though', 'wartime', 'Japan', 'was', 'hardly', 'Eden', 'movie', 'portray', 'warplanes', 'created', 'here', 'wrought', 'terrible', 'destruction', 'Japanese', 'fronts', 'WWII', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'seen', 'eyes', 'child', 'unaware', 'hard', 'adult', 'truths', 'have', 'way', 'know', 'case', 'came', 'away', 'impression', 'having', 'seen', 'half', 'something', 'where', 'darker', 'half', 'had', 'been', 'carefully', 'excised.', 'wiredweird']",The Wind Rises
