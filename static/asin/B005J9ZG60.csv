I assumed it was pronounced phonetically and the hundred other movies that uses a ""ne-craw-moncer"" have it wrong (sarcasm).This movie was an almost unbelievably bad crapfest.  You get horribly cheap looking zombies, running in an underground section that looks suspiciously like the Dwarven ruins in the first LoTR movie, and a vampire hunter wannabe (except there are no vampires) that always fights the plethora of zombies while holding his katana irritatingly underhanded.The acting is putrid with the exception of Brad Dourif.  His playing of the ne-craw-moncer was the one acting highpoint of the film (not very high).  It's just a shame his dialogue is ridiculous, but he delivers it with style and flourish!!!!There isn't much to recommend this movie.  Brad Dourif must have owed someone a favor to appear in this bullcrap.

The problem is that it's like a meal where you toss in so much stuff it loses it's identity. So we get a little bit of undead vampire-looking black cloaked swordsman that slices the zombies and piranha toothed Alien Predator cross thingy, and Halloween masked thingy, and a Potter wicked sorcerer.(2.) We get the already been used cheap looking CGI special effects of creatures that turn into crows or dusty ashes only to reappear later. The customary corn field; the old house with spider webs that oddly looked exactly the same and in the same place after 10 years; never explained ripped sheets hanging from the ceiling that made no sense but added some cheap visual effect. The magical stone necklace (looked like prop jewelry) that seems to be the focus of the plot line but we barely see it until the very end when it gets stabbed and then not much happens.(3.) The acting, script and dialogue consisted of 10 words or less (usually a lot less) followed by long pauses between lines while the viewer waits for the teleprompter to change to the next line. The acting was just as statue rigid as the dialogue. The only action to break things up was the soon tiresome black caped person twirling and swinging at what seemed like an endless stream of bit actors acting like zombies.",1,Kiosk Rating &lt;1,1321920000,"11 22, 2011",2011,1407,"['1', 'writer', 'really', 'tried', 'cover', 'bases', 'tossing', 'little', 'bit', 'horror', 'icon', 'recent', 'movie', 'memory', 'problem', 'meal', 'where', 'toss', 'so', 'much', 'stuff', 'identity', 'get', 'little', 'bit', 'undead', 'vampire-looking', 'black', 'cloaked', 'swordsman', 'zombies', 'piranha', 'toothed', 'Alien', 'Predator', 'cross', 'thingy', 'Halloween', 'masked', 'thingy', 'Potter', 'wicked', 'sorcerer.', '2', 'get', 'already', 'been', 'used', 'cheap', 'looking', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'creatures', 'turn', 'crows', 'dusty', 'ashes', 'only', 'reappear', 'later', 'customary', 'corn', 'field', 'old', 'house', 'spider', 'webs', 'oddly', 'looked', 'exactly', 'same', 'same', 'place', '10', 'years', 'never', 'explained', 'ripped', 'sheets', 'hanging', 'ceiling', 'made', 'sense', 'added', 'cheap', 'visual', 'effect', 'magical', 'stone', 'necklace', 'looked', 'prop', 'jewelry', 'be', 'focus', 'plot', 'line', 'barely', 'see', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'stabbed', 'then', 'not', 'much', 'happens.', '3', 'acting', 'script', 'dialogue', 'consisted', '10', 'words', 'less', 'usually', 'lot', 'less', 'followed', 'long', 'pauses', 'lines', 'viewer', 'waits', 'teleprompter', 'change', 'next', 'line', 'acting', 'was', 'just', 'statue', 'rigid', 'dialogue', 'only', 'action', 'break', 'things', 'up', 'was', 'soon', 'tiresome', 'black', 'caped', 'person', 'twirling', 'swinging', 'what', 'seemed', 'endless', 'stream', 'bit', 'actors', 'acting', 'zombies']",Fading Of The Cries

1463161,A16XRPF40679KG,B005J9ZG60,Michael Dobey,"[0, 0]","Ok, this isn't a great movie. But the effects were pretty good for a low budget flick. I understood the plot all the way through this movie too. It is a missmash of many other horror flicks too.  It has a brooding dead swordsman who is actually (spoiler) a protection spell. It has brad douriff as a evil over the top sorcerer, and a town that is killed and become dead shells attacking the living.  Ok, it's got a lot of stuff in here but It did make sense, the sorcerer wanted his amulet back so he could return from the dead, and he wreck his vengeance , which he already did actually by wiping out the town. he has three helpers straight out of hellraiser to help him and they are very effective as they are not  cgi effects. This is something that Hollywood should remember that cgi doesn't work as well as straight makeup on actualy people usually. And this movie got this. If you don't like low budget horror films then you shouldn't watch this one probably. I mean if the people who complain about this one can't handle it, then I hope they never watch a old horror film from the past! I mean the effects here would have been top notch in 1997, so just imagine them watching a movie from before that?.  Anyways , this is enjoyable in a over the top way and it doesn't have a happy ending. Which may have pissed people off , but I thought it was brave to end it that way.  So for a low budget film lover this was a worthwhile watch. But then I enjoyed 'attack of the crab monsters' from 1958. Like I said low budget does the best they can and that's ok usually.

1463162,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B005J9ZG60,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Fading of the Cries (Brian A. Metcalf, 2011)When it comes to horror movie lists, Fading of the Cries was the only one that almost approached the same uniformity on worst-of lists that plagued Hellraiser: Revelations. And Fading of the Cries is indeed that horrific, though in an entirely different way than Revelations is; everything about this movie is simply wrong, in ways that make no semblance of sense.Fading of the Cries does in fact have a plot, though I'm unsure I can relay it to you in any coherent fashion (this is because the script cannot, and even the synopsis listed on IMDB only gives the barest bones of this mess: there's Jacob (Jordan Matthews in his screen debut). Jacob has a sword, and his main job seems to be fighting Matthias (Death Machine's Brad Dourif), a necromancer (side note: the consistent mispronunciation of the word ""necromancer"" in this movie is the funniest/most painful thing about it) who's after an amulet currently owned by Sarah (You've Got Mail's Hallee Hirsh), whose father, it seems, stole it from Matthias some years ago. Despite all this (which takes up roughly the first seven-eighths of the movie), it seems the actual main character of the thing was supposed to be Jill (7th Heaven's Mackenzie Rosman), Sarah's younger sister, who if nothing else is the movie's best-drawn (and funniest, though always unintentionally) character.Which makes no sense until you actually sit through the thing, and please, for the love of peaches, if you value your sanity, I can only say one thing: don't. This is a movie that makes no sense not only in its execution but in its conception. The guy who wrote the score seems to have thought (or been told) that he was writing the soundtrack to a Hallmark Original Movie (an extra-inspirational one to boot). Metcalf , turning in his first feature, does his level best to make sure that every piece of miscasting to be found here is exploited to the very limits of its potential for confusion, which is also a fine description of the viewer's reaction to Brad Rushing (Shrieker)'s puzzling, sometimes ridiculous, choices with the cinematography.  In other words, the only reason I'm giving this movie half a star is that I finished watching it, for reasons that shall forever remain unknown to me. Please don't make the same mistake.

A rebellious young woman defies her mother and goes out at night to the vacant home owned by her late uncle. Suddenly she's attacked by zombies and a young man wielding a sword appears and saves her. He's so good with the blade he can kill seven with one swipe!  From there, flashbacks of his story and the uncle's story intertwine to explain the core of the plot but not where all those zombies came from. There are so many the whole town must've died. The sight of hundreds of bodies littering meadows, streets, and the heroine's front lawn is impressive to say the least.  This seems to be two movies spliced into one. Brad Dourif is his usual menacing self though a little more restrained than usual. The title is mentioned twice but unfortunately I wasn't able to connect it to the story because the sound went down at that point.  The ending is also a disappointment.
