929706,A3S5WYWYKSAI9C,B000AOEN18,Bradley Olin,"[2, 2]","I first began watching ""The Adventures of Pete and Pete"" as a kid growing up in the 90s.  The show instantly struck a chord (literally) with me.  The combination of narrative and whimsical tales that every kid ponders (International Parent Conspiracy, Outer Space, Independence, Love), to the great cameos (Michael Stipe, Iggy Pop, Steve Buscemi, Adam West, Kate Pierson), exposure to indie rock (which I still appreciate to this day), and endearing characters really made this show magical for me.I'll never forget watching ""King of the Road"" and just giggling my head off while my dad watched next to me and laughed along.  There aren't many kids shows out there that can transcend generational gaps like that. I can still go back and enjoy these episodes at 24 as much if not more so than I did when I was a kid.  I think that says it all.  The commentary on the DVDs makes it just that much more special when you see how fresh this all was for the time.Season 2 continues with the tradition of heartwarming and silly tales.  I just hope they release the rest of the seasons from the Nickelodeon/Paramount vault.",5,A Childhood favorite is Still Relevant,1165622400,"12 9, 2006",2006,1115,"['first', 'began', 'watching', 'Adventures', 'Pete', 'Pete', 'kid', 'growing', 'up', '90s', 'show', 'instantly', 'struck', 'chord', 'literally', 'combination', 'narrative', 'whimsical', 'tales', 'kid', 'ponders', 'International', 'Parent', 'Conspiracy', 'Outer', 'Space', 'Independence', 'Love', 'great', 'cameos', 'Michael', 'Stipe', 'Iggy', 'Pop', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Adam', 'West', 'Kate', 'Pierson', 'exposure', 'indie', 'rock', 'still', 'appreciate', 'day', 'endearing', 'characters', 'really', 'made', 'show', 'magical', 'me.I', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'watching', 'King', 'Road', 'just', 'giggling', 'head', 'dad', 'watched', 'next', 'laughed', 'along', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'kids', 'out', 'there', 'can', 'transcend', 'generational', 'gaps', 'can', 'still', 'go', 'back', 'enjoy', 'episodes', '24', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'think', 'commentary', 'DVDs', 'just', 'much', 'more', 'special', 'when', 'see', 'how', 'fresh', 'was', 'time.Season', '2', 'tradition', 'heartwarming', 'silly', 'tales', 'just', 'hope', 'release', 'rest', 'seasons', 'Nickelodeon/Paramount', 'vault']",N/A

929710,A29GGWB3GGQBO9,B000AOEN18,GPeralta,"[2, 3]","Well, like the first season of this set, the second season has al of the season's episodes, but lacks in getting the nooks and crannies of your standard mainstream DVD set. First, is the whole video transfer. Although it's not horrible quality, I was disappointed that it wasn't remastered to cover for the few years that have brought some grain to the picture.Another thing was the fact that the 1 special and 5 of the shorts were included as the sets special features. I really felt that the specials and shorts should have been either given their own release or all included the first season's release. Randomly including some of the specials and shorts in each season set just seems too random and not worthy of such a great show.The episodes with audio commentaries are ""Halloweenie,"" ""Farewell, My Little Viking (Parts 1 and 2),"" and ""Yellow Fever,"" which received an award and helped get P&P; a third season. Although the audio commentary is hilarious, and informative, seeing some behind the scenes footage or some kind of reunion interview would have been better, especially since most of us haven't seen the show in 10+ years.And when it comes to the techinical things, there are no subtitles in any languages. Also, it would have been interesting to see some kind of dub for the episodes in other languages just to cover all of the basic DVD options. But we're just left with one language and closed captions reached through your TV settings.All in all, the special features could have been better handled, but the set does include all of season 2's episodes and is its first release on DVD. I wouldn't count on a re-release with better features, so this is your best bet on getting something that should have had a DVD for some time now.",4,"Near Perfect, with some Small Problems that only a Hardcore Fan would Notice",1153180800,"07 18, 2006",2006,1749,"['Well', 'first', 'season', 'set', 'second', 'season', 'al', 'season', 'episodes', 'lacks', 'getting', 'nooks', 'crannies', 'standard', 'mainstream', 'DVD', 'set', 'First', 'whole', 'video', 'transfer', 'not', 'horrible', 'quality', 'was', 'disappointed', 'was', ""n't"", 'remastered', 'cover', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'brought', 'grain', 'picture.Another', 'thing', 'was', 'fact', '1', 'special', '5', 'shorts', 'were', 'included', 'sets', 'special', 'features', 'really', 'felt', 'specials', 'shorts', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'either', 'given', 'own', 'release', 'included', 'first', 'season', 'release', 'Randomly', 'including', 'specials', 'shorts', 'season', 'set', 'just', 'too', 'random', 'not', 'worthy', 'such', 'great', 'show.The', 'episodes', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'are', 'Halloweenie', 'Farewell', 'My', 'Little', 'Viking', 'Parts', '1', '2', 'Yellow', 'Fever', 'received', 'award', 'helped', 'get', 'P', 'P', 'third', 'season', 'audio', 'commentary', 'hilarious', 'informative', 'seeing', 'scenes', 'footage', 'kind', 'reunion', 'interview', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'especially', 'most', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', '10+', 'years.And', 'when', 'techinical', 'things', 'are', 'subtitles', 'languages', 'Also', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'see', 'kind', 'dub', 'episodes', 'other', 'languages', 'just', 'cover', 'basic', 'DVD', 'options', ""'re"", 'just', 'left', 'one', 'language', 'closed', 'captions', 'reached', 'TV', 'settings.All', 'special', 'features', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'handled', 'set', 'include', 'season', '2', 'episodes', 'first', 'release', 'DVD', 'would', ""n't"", 'count', 're-release', 'better', 'features', 'best', 'bet', 'getting', 'something', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'DVD', 'time', 'now']",N/A

Anyway, it would appear our prayers have been answered, Pete & Pete Season 2 is here!!! Not to correct the Amazon staff, (or the Nick and Paramount staffs for that matter), but the running year on top of this page is wrong. Season 2 ran from September 1994 to June 1995 so it should say 1994, not 1993. Season 2 contains most of my favorite episodes,(not counting Nightcrawlers of course). They include ""The Call"" about a haunted pay phone, ""Inspector 34"" which teaches us a lesson about the dangers of pefectionism, and the Halloween episode ""Halloweenie"" where some goons in pumpkin masks, (The Pumpkin Eaters), are trying to outlaw Halloween and it's up to older Pete to stop them and save this scariest of all holidays. I eagerly await Season 2, in the mean time I'll keep myself occupied with Season 1. Full speed my little vikings! Also, here's to hoping they release my other favorite live action Nick show, Are You Afraid Of The Dark? soon too. (Update 6/11/06) To confirm a fellow reviewer's facts there does seem to be a problem with Pete & Pete Season 3. Paramount originally placed it on their release list for February 28th 2006 but obviously that never happened. When Paramount executives found out about this they said it was a mistake and quikly removed it from the list. It still has yet to reappear on the list again. I'm keeping my fingers crossed and I hope all of my fellow Pete fans are too. It doesn't look good though. Hey, if they can't release it could they at least tell us why? Also Artie had to leave in the middle of season 2. Man, I'm gonna miss that big beautiful mutant. So long Artie, wherever you are, we'll never forget you. *sniff* (Update 9/23/07) I heard that one problem with season 3 was the fight between CBS and Nick's mother company Viacom,(I swear those people are evil). After Viacom pulled the plug on CBS's showing of Nick Toons on Saturday mornings, Nick decided to seperate from Viacom as well thus messing up Nick Rewind for all of us. Look for me at [...] screen name Nightwatcher where I'll tell all in a future article. (Update-8/15/10) Yeah, I know, it's been a while but incase you missed my article at retrojunk it would seem that the reason for the first Nick Rewind's cancelation was due to Paramount joining forces with Dreamworks so that Nick can aire The Penguins of Madagascar. Nick has recently made a deal with...well...this very site to continue the release of their older shows on DVD but so far it's only for the older Nicktoons and is sort of spotty at best as only certain Nicktoons have seen complete season set releases so far. Keep your fingers crossed though, hopefully they will get around to the live action shows soon. (Update - 6/28/11) Well it's taken another year but their may be some good news for us Pete fans. Come next month amazon will release Hey Dude Season 1 on DVD. This could mark the beinning of the official releases of Nick's older live action shows from amazon's burn on demand. I've already put in a request for Pete & Pete season 3 and I know some of my fellow vikings have also. I hope that everyone is still keeping those fingers crossed because this may be promising. Hopefully I'll have more soon, stay tuned... (Update 9/4/11) It seems I made a mistake. Shout Factory is releasing Hey Dude Season 1 not amazon. They picked up the licencing to retro Nick so that the older shows, both animated and live action, can be released. This may be a good thing so keep those hopes up.

So, while I loved watching Pete and Pete back in 1993 when I was 8 years old, I was skeptical again watching it as an adult. However, nostalgia got the best of me and I ordered these.This show has stood the test of time.It is every bit as enjoyable now as it was then. Additionally, I notice things now that were above me when I was younger. This show is insightful, full of amusing youthful angst, and funny. A great addition to my DVD collection. The episodes included in season 2 are:1. Grounded for Life - Little Pete destroys the lawn and gets grounded over the 4th of July2. Field of Pete - Big Pete's baseball team goes on a winning streak due to Little Pete's insults and Orange Lazarus3.

929721,A2ZNNWBPW04E17,B000AOEN18,"Steve ""1nburg""","[7, 8]","I love the show and bought the second season as soon as it came out on DVD.  Alas, just like with the first season, this set was flawed and thus I can't give it a better score.  Season One had the problem with ""Day of the Dot"" and Season Two has a problem with the bonus episode on disc 2.  ""Space, Geeks, and Johnny Unitas"" has a major problem with the audio that distracts from fully enjoying the episode and thus flawing the set.  When the episode begins, as Big Pete is talking, you can hear in the background some audio that is from a different part of the show that's not supposed to be there.  Sound from audio that begins 20 seconds into the episode can be heard at the very beginning of the show and continues for most, if not all, of the episode.  I thought maybe it was just a defective disc so I exchanged it for another and the same thing happened.  As Pete's talking, you can hear Artie in the background reciting his dialogue that doesn't occur until twenty seconds later and it just goes on from there until the end.  I can't be the only one who has noticed this.  All the reviews I've read from here and elsewhere don't mention this but it's clearly a defect that needs to be fixed.  I can understand the 1st season problem what with the poor video quality of the episode (that line in the picture is very distracting) but this is something that should have been found and fixed before releasing it to the public.  Nickelodeon and Paramount need to fix this flaw and all others in the series since ""The Adventures of Pete and Pete"" is a great show that is fondly remembered by it's fans and to put out a problematic DVD collection not only makes you look bad but makes us, the people you depend on to buy your product in the first place, less willing to support you if this keeps up.",2,Does Anyone Else Have This Problem???,1131580800,"11 10, 2005",2005,1800,"['love', 'show', 'bought', 'second', 'season', 'as', 'soon', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'Alas', 'just', 'first', 'season', 'set', 'was', 'flawed', 'thus', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'better', 'score', 'Season', 'One', 'had', 'problem', 'Day', 'Dot', 'Season', 'Two', 'problem', 'bonus', 'episode', 'disc', '2', 'Space', 'Geeks', 'Johnny', 'Unitas', 'major', 'problem', 'audio', 'fully', 'enjoying', 'episode', 'thus', 'flawing', 'set', 'When', 'episode', 'Big', 'Pete', 'talking', 'can', 'hear', 'background', 'audio', 'different', 'part', 'show', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'there', 'Sound', 'audio', '20', 'seconds', 'episode', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'very', 'beginning', 'show', 'most', 'not', 'episode', 'thought', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'defective', 'disc', 'so', 'exchanged', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'Pete', 'talking', 'can', 'hear', 'Artie', 'background', 'reciting', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'occur', 'twenty', 'seconds', 'later', 'just', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'noticed', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'here', 'elsewhere', 'do', ""n't"", 'mention', 'clearly', 'defect', 'be', 'fixed', 'can', 'understand', '1st', 'season', 'problem', 'what', 'poor', 'video', 'quality', 'episode', 'line', 'picture', 'very', 'distracting', 'something', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'found', 'fixed', 'releasing', 'public', 'Nickelodeon', 'Paramount', 'need', 'fix', 'flaw', 'others', 'series', 'Adventures', 'Pete', 'Pete', 'great', 'show', 'fondly', 'remembered', 'fans', 'put', 'out', 'problematic', 'DVD', 'collection', 'not', 'only', 'look', 'bad', 'people', 'depend', 'buy', 'product', 'first', 'place', 'less', 'willing', 'support', 'up']",N/A
