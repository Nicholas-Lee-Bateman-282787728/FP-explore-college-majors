1264449,A3TMC106MIY8S5,B002DYKBZA,A. Edward Azad,"[9, 11]","First off, let me say that if ""The Next Doctor"" has any shortcomings, it's not the fault of the actors. The two Davids (Tennant and Morrissey) give some really stellar work here; nuanced, passionate and believable. Morrissey, in particular, gives a much better performance than this deserves. I would recommend seeing this special solely for their performances alone. Even the actress who plays Rosita is delightful, and I wish we saw more of her in this episode. The actual story, however, reeks of wasted potential, even for 60 minutes. For a premise this grand, you really need two hours to properly present it all. Failing that, however, you could at least make this Cyberman adventure distinguishable from the others. Simply jacking up the awful musical score to downright-intrusive levels won't do the trick.The revelation about the ""next"" Doctor's nature is revealed pretty early on, which deflates most of what follows. The Cybermen have learned a few new tricks, including the part-simian versions that are covered in fur, but we don't delve into exactly what they are or why the Cybermen are making them. To put it bluntly, the whole affair feels by-the-numbers. It begins with a haphazard murder mystery which turns out to be superfluous; yes, the Doctor will snoop around and find the answers instantly; yes, the Doctor will casually overpower the villain with little to no effort; yes, everyone fawns over the Doctor (the camera literally zooms in whenever someone even mentions his name) and thinks he's the greatest thing since ice cream. The only thing lacking is...well, a plot. The villain's motives and overall aim are taken for granted; she's evil, she wants to rule the world. What else is there to know?Well, nothing much, if you're a kid. In fact, the series as a whole has been drifting further and further away from the mass appeal of the earlier seasons, and is now catered exclusively toward kids. And rather dim kids, at that; the script is overloaded with exposition, literally narrating the Doctor's every move, no matter how obvious it is to the viewer. I shudder to think what will become of this series once David Tennant's seasoned grasp of the character and his mannerisms have left the show, and the lead performances become as hollow as everything else.",3,Bad precedent?,1255392000,"10 13, 2009",2009,2290,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'say', 'Next', 'Doctor', 'shortcomings', 'not', 'fault', 'actors', 'two', 'Davids', 'Tennant', 'Morrissey', 'give', 'really', 'stellar', 'work', 'here', 'nuanced', 'passionate', 'believable', 'Morrissey', 'particular', 'much', 'better', 'performance', 'would', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'special', 'solely', 'performances', 'alone', 'Even', 'actress', 'who', 'Rosita', 'delightful', 'wish', 'saw', 'more', 'episode', 'actual', 'story', 'however', 'reeks', 'wasted', 'potential', 'even', '60', 'minutes', 'premise', 'grand', 'really', 'need', 'two', 'hours', 'properly', 'present', 'Failing', 'however', 'could', 'least', 'make', 'Cyberman', 'adventure', 'distinguishable', 'others', 'Simply', 'jacking', 'up', 'awful', 'musical', 'score', 'downright-intrusive', 'levels', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'trick.The', 'revelation', 'next', 'Doctor', 'nature', 'revealed', 'pretty', 'early', 'most', 'what', 'Cybermen', 'have', 'learned', 'few', 'new', 'tricks', 'including', 'part-simian', 'versions', 'are', 'covered', 'fur', 'do', ""n't"", 'delve', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'why', 'Cybermen', 'are', 'making', 'put', 'bluntly', 'whole', 'affair', 'feels', 'by-the-numbers', 'haphazard', 'murder', 'mystery', 'out', 'be', 'superfluous', 'yes', 'Doctor', 'will', 'snoop', 'find', 'answers', 'instantly', 'yes', 'Doctor', 'will', 'casually', 'overpower', 'villain', 'little', 'effort', 'yes', 'everyone', 'fawns', 'Doctor', 'camera', 'literally', 'whenever', 'someone', 'even', 'name', 'greatest', 'thing', 'ice', 'cream', 'only', 'thing', 'lacking', 'well', 'plot', 'villain', 'motives', 'overall', 'aim', 'are', 'taken', 'granted', 'evil', 'rule', 'world', 'What', 'else', 'there', 'know', 'Well', 'nothing', 'much', ""'re"", 'kid', 'fact', 'series', 'whole', 'been', 'drifting', 'further', 'further', 'away', 'mass', 'appeal', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'now', 'catered', 'exclusively', 'kids', 'rather', 'dim', 'kids', 'script', 'overloaded', 'exposition', 'literally', 'narrating', 'Doctor', 'move', 'matter', 'how', 'obvious', 'viewer', 'shudder', 'think', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'series', 'once', 'David', 'Tennant', 'seasoned', 'grasp', 'character', 'mannerisms', 'have', 'left', 'show', 'lead', 'become', 'as', 'hollow', 'everything', 'else']",Doctor Who: The Next Doctor
1264450,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B002DYKBZA,A. Gammill,"[36, 36]","The thing that immediately impressed me about ""The Next Doctor"" was that you don't necessarily have to be a long-time fan to enjoy it.  But for those viewers who ARE faithful followers of the traveling Time Lord (myself included), it's a fine combination of elements that have traditionally worked in Doctor Who stories.  The episode is full of action, humor, pathos, better-than-average performances, and a sense of wonder that has long been missing from t.v. science fiction.[SPOILERS AHEAD] The Doctor is delighted to find himself in Victorian England at Christmastime.  He is soon surprised, however, to encounter another fellow claiming to be ""the one, the only, the best"" Doctor.  With his own companion, sonic screwdriver (sort of) and TARDIS (a wonderful twist which I refuse to spoil), this Doctor is man with some crucial memories missing.  What the REAL Doctor finds out about this mystery man is tragic yet inspiring, and touches on the whole history of the series.  Oh, and did I mention the Cybermen are on-hand as well?The entire production is first-rate, from the gorgeously-realized snowy streets to the impressive spectacle of the Cyber King on the march.  Guest star David Morrisey is so good in his role, you almost wish he WAS the next Doctor.  And like the best of the modern episodes, the resolution is both satisfying and leaves you wanting to see more.The disc also includes an interesting special, ""Doctor Who at the Proms.""  This is an hour-long concert of the show's music peformed at the Royal Albert Hall.  In addition to big screens projecting images from the show's first 4 seasons, there are actors dressed as Cybermen, Judoon, etc. that roam through the aisles to the delight of the crowd.  Freema Ageyman hosts, with a special appearance by Catherine Tate.  It's a fun way to enjoy the great music from the show.I have no doubt that BBC will eventually release all the one-off specials featuring David Tennant in a box set when all is said and done.  But if you can't wait, ""The Next Doctor"" is a perfect way to pass the time.",5,"Immensely entertaining, a prime example of modern Dr. Who",1246320000,"06 30, 2009",2009,2061,"['thing', 'immediately', 'impressed', 'Next', 'Doctor', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'have', 'be', 'long-time', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'viewers', 'who', 'ARE', 'faithful', 'followers', 'traveling', 'Time', 'Lord', 'included', 'fine', 'combination', 'elements', 'have', 'traditionally', 'worked', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'episode', 'full', 'action', 'humor', 'pathos', 'better-than-average', 'performances', 'sense', 'wonder', 'long', 'been', 'missing', 't.v', 'science', 'fiction', '[', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', ']', 'Doctor', 'delighted', 'find', 'Victorian', 'England', 'Christmastime', 'soon', 'surprised', 'however', 'encounter', 'fellow', 'claiming', 'be', 'one', 'only', 'best', 'Doctor', 'own', 'companion', 'sonic', 'screwdriver', 'sort', 'TARDIS', 'wonderful', 'twist', 'refuse', 'spoil', 'Doctor', 'man', 'crucial', 'memories', 'missing', 'What', 'REAL', 'Doctor', 'out', 'mystery', 'man', 'tragic', 'yet', 'inspiring', 'touches', 'whole', 'history', 'series', 'Oh', 'did', 'mention', 'Cybermen', 'are', 'on-hand', 'well', 'entire', 'production', 'first-rate', 'gorgeously-realized', 'snowy', 'streets', 'impressive', 'spectacle', 'Cyber', 'King', 'march', 'Guest', 'star', 'David', 'Morrisey', 'so', 'good', 'role', 'almost', 'wish', 'next', 'Doctor', 'best', 'modern', 'episodes', 'resolution', 'satisfying', 'wanting', 'see', 'more.The', 'disc', 'also', 'interesting', 'special', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Proms', 'hour-long', 'concert', 'show', 'music', 'peformed', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'addition', 'big', 'screens', 'projecting', 'images', 'show', 'first', '4', 'seasons', 'are', 'actors', 'dressed', 'Cybermen', 'Judoon', 'etc', 'aisles', 'delight', 'crowd', 'Freema', 'Ageyman', 'special', 'appearance', 'Catherine', 'Tate', 'fun', 'way', 'enjoy', 'great', 'music', 'show.I', 'have', 'doubt', 'BBC', 'will', 'eventually', 'release', 'one-off', 'specials', 'featuring', 'David', 'Tennant', 'box', 'set', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Next', 'Doctor', 'perfect', 'way', 'pass', 'time']",Doctor Who: The Next Doctor

1264453,A3UKTEEU8TWNV7,B002DYKBZA,B. Starbuck,"[14, 19]","... and it's not a horrible story. I've seen worse.Plus, most of the Christmas specials are filled with fluff anyway, in keeping with the holiday spirit. That being said, this story is a fun bit of Christmas cheer, although it lacks depth on some levels, but I'll still line it up with the other Christmas specials for Christmas morning viewing. I will say though, I thought the Cyber-Shades were kind of creepy and I hope they bring them back at some point. On the other hand, the Cyber-King ""ship"" was a bit too much on the cheesy side for me, and while I first relished the character of Ms. Hartigan, she completely crashed and burned into the cheese fest.Another thing that stirred the bee in my bonnet was the Rosita character, and I'm going to say something that a lot of people ~ especially fans of the new series ~ won't like: Enough with Rose Tyler, already! I mean, come on. Bleeding hearts of the world unite! Enough with the references, the inferences, the parallels, the longing, the tragedy of it all, etc. The writers, including Russell T. Davies, whom I happen to actually love, being a writer myself, have beat this like a dead horse and to a bloody pulp. Yes, we know the Doctor has great affection for her; yes, we know he can never be with her, but let's move on. Please.It's for this reason that I am really anxious for Steven Moffat to take the reins of the series ~ and in a way, I'm glad there's a new Doctor. I love David Tennant and I think he's been absolutely brilliant ~ right up there with, if not surpassing, Tom Baker ~ but this whole, galactic playboy thing (as further evidenced in Planet of the Dead) is wearing thin. The character of the Doctor is NOT Captain Kirk and he is NOT about romantic baggage, thank you very much ~ and I'm saying that as a chick, who initially loved the character of Rose and her deeper friendship with the Doctor. It was different than the classic series, with a little more humanity thrown in, instead of the cold, androgynous, teacher-student, master-apprentice dynamic. But enough.There, I said it. I feel much better now.On the upside, David Morrissey's portrayal of ""The Doctor"" was quite fun to watch as a romanticized, chivalrous version of our favorite Time Lord, and some of his dialogue and interaction with the real Doctor was thrilling, thinking that this might just be a future version him, with memories lost. Alas, 'twas not meant to be, which is kind of a bummer, because I think Morrissey would have made a great eleventh Doctor.On the whole, though, it's a fun little frolic ~ not on the A-list, but rather on the B-list, in the canon of the Whoniverse. But like I said, I've seen worse, and as we tick down the days and months to David Tennant's departure, I do feel a certain sadness. He's been MY Doctor of the revived series, just like Baker was in the classic, even though I loved Christopher Eccleston, too, and I will be sad when Tennant leaves.But hey! Viva la Doctor!

How do we react to personal tragedy?  Even someone who is so internally wounded can barricade himself in fantasy in order to cope as proactively as possible.  David Tennant gives a very tender and nuanced performance.  Every time I watch it, I find a new aspect to admire.

Unfortunately, the suspense with the Cybermen was a bit lacking compared to the 2-part episodes (""Rise of Cybermen"" and ""The Age of Steel"") from Season 2 with Rose Tyler.  The ending was a letdown and totally a cop-out compared to the 2-parter from Season 2.  But, the real twist is figuring out this new ""Doctor"" character played by David Morrissey.  Yes, he was in ""Basic Instinct 2"" with Sharon Stone but at heart is a British actor deep in BBC productions.  Hearing him talk with the REAL ""Doctor"" is a hoot and you will easily be won-over with his emotional rollercoaster ride.  Cybermen are NOT scary in this special which is sad but I think writers were counting on the whole David against David banter to last for 60 minutes.  If you are a true ""Doctor Who"" fan, then get it.  If you are the occasional viewer, then check first with ""Planet of the Dead"" before ""The Next Doctor"".  Also, I can't wait for ""Waters of Mars"" and ""The End of Time"" 2-parter season finale.  I don't get the Dish but others can catch it on BBC America in December 19 for ""Waters of Mars"" and December 26 for the first part of ""The End of Time"".

I stopped soon after Tom Baker left. The new Doctors were just too way out there.  When the new series started, I was thrilled.  I've enjoyed almost all the episodes and specials.  There are only two exceptions. ""Daleks in Manhattan"" was terrible.  Laughable. Then giving individual Daleks time travel capabilities? Where did that come from? The Dalek / human hybrid? What was the costume budget - $5 and a dead squid?  This special reminds me of that episode.The Cybermen rely on a human as a control circuit?  Rely on inefficient kids as labor, when adults or automation would be a lot faster.  What was the power source, coal?!? And again, all Daleks have time travel technology built in?Now let's add the method the new ""Doctor"" becomes the Doctor.  By contact with what is a digital version of ""Doctor Who for Dummy Cybermen.""  Not watching it - touching it.  Totally unbelievable, even in the DoctorVerse.

The NEXT DOCTOR aired on Christmas 2008.The Doctor arrives in London, England in 1851 and immediately has a run-in with a man (David Morrisey) who claims to be The Doctor. At first The Doctor thinks the man is a future incarnation of himself. However, he soon deduces otherwise. Meanwhile, a bitter woman named Miss Hartigan is working with Cybermen to steal children throughout the city. For her help, she has been given great power and is promised that she will not be &#8220;upgraded.&#8221;THE NEXT DOCTOR is a fairly decent episode of DOCTOR WHO. It&#8217;s not as serious as some of the other specials that follow. You don&#8217;t have to be bogged down with a lot of backstory to understand the episode. It helps if you have a basic familiarity with the character and the series, but it&#8217;s not even really necessary. Besides being a Christmas episode, THE NEXT DOCTOR is memorable in the series for introducing the Cybermen data storage devices known as &#8220;infostamps&#8221; and for introducing the Cybershades, a kind of cyberman that had the brain of a cat or dog.I enjoyed the episode. Some things were a bit too predictable and convenient, but that often happens in Doctor Who. The episode doesn&#8217;t reveal much about The Doctor, but that&#8217;s what made it such a good Christmas episode.THE NEXT DOCTOR DVD also includes an hour-long musical special called &#8220;Doctor Who at the Proms&#8221; which is a musical special that took place at the Royal Albert Hall.",4,The Doctor Flies Alone,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,1714,"['NEXT', 'DOCTOR', 'was', 'first', 'series', 'tv', 'specials', 'were', 'part', 'David', 'Tennant', '8217', 'send', 'off', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'as', 'well', 'way', 'allow', 'new', 'show', 'runner', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'prepare', 'fully', 'take', 'control', 'series', 'NEXT', 'DOCTOR', 'aired', 'Christmas', '2008.The', 'Doctor', 'arrives', 'London', 'England', '1851', 'immediately', 'run-in', 'man', 'David', 'Morrisey', 'who', 'be', 'Doctor', 'first', 'Doctor', 'man', 'future', 'incarnation', 'However', 'soon', 'otherwise', 'Meanwhile', 'bitter', 'woman', 'named', 'Miss', 'Hartigan', 'working', 'Cybermen', 'steal', 'children', 'city', 'help', 'been', 'given', 'great', 'power', 'promised', 'will', 'not', 'be', '8220', 'upgraded.', '8221', 'THE', 'NEXT', 'DOCTOR', 'fairly', 'decent', 'episode', 'DOCTOR', 'WHO', '8217', 'not', 'as', 'serious', 'other', 'specials', 'follow', 'don', '8217', 't', 'have', 'be', 'bogged', 'down', 'lot', 'backstory', 'understand', 'episode', 'have', 'basic', 'familiarity', 'character', 'series', '8217', 'not', 'even', 'really', 'necessary', 'being', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'THE', 'NEXT', 'DOCTOR', 'memorable', 'series', 'introducing', 'Cybermen', 'data', 'storage', 'devices', 'known', '8220', '8221', 'introducing', 'Cybershades', 'kind', 'cyberman', 'had', 'brain', 'cat', 'dog.I', 'enjoyed', 'episode', 'things', 'were', 'bit', 'too', 'predictable', 'convenient', 'often', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'episode', 'doesn', '8217', 'reveal', 'much', 'Doctor', '8217', 's', 'what', 'made', 'such', 'good', 'Christmas', 'episode.THE', 'NEXT', 'DOCTOR', 'DVD', 'also', 'hour-long', 'musical', 'special', 'called', '8220', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Proms', '8221', 'musical', 'special', 'took', 'place', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall']",Doctor Who: The Next Doctor
