On stage rather than on film, Fonda was a force of nature and one could now see that the stage was his venue---not the movies.  Although he gave some brilliant performances on  film such as &#34;The Grapes of Wrath&#34;, &#34;On Golden Pond&#34;, &#34;Once Upon A Time in the West&#34; and &#34;12 Angry Men&#34;, Fonda shined even  brighter on a stage---he even  remarked that the stage version of his &#34;Mister Roberts&#34; was superior to the film version.  This brilliant stage play is ample proof of this great actor's genius.",5,Fonda's one and only one man performance,1397001600,"04 9, 2014",2014,660,"['once', 'saw', 'telecast', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'one', 'man', 'show', 'great', 'criminal', 'lawyer', 'Clarence', 'Darrow', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'stage', 'rather', 'film', 'Fonda', 'was', 'force', 'nature', 'one', 'could', 'now', 'see', 'stage', 'was', 'venue', '-not', 'movies', 'gave', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'film', 'such', '34', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', '34', '34', 'Golden', 'Pond', '34', '34', 'Once', 'A', 'Time', 'West', '34', '34', '12', 'Angry', 'Men', '34', 'Fonda', 'shined', 'even', 'brighter', 'stage', '-he', 'even', 'remarked', 'stage', 'version', '34', 'Mister', 'Roberts', '34', 'was', 'superior', 'film', 'version', 'brilliant', 'stage', 'play', 'ample', 'proof', 'great', 'actor', 'genius']",N/A

961239,A3B4G8FF8VC1V3,B000CQQIUI,J. Preston,"[3, 3]","In 1975, Henry Fonda performed this monologue, live, in various cities across the U.S.  This is a film version of his live theatre performances.The screenplay (monologue) is based on Irving Stone's 1971 biography:Clarence Darrow for the defense: A biography (A Bantam biography).I had the privilege of seeing Mr. Fonda perform this live monologue at the Cleveland Playhouse Theater in 1975.  I was young, and it was an inspiring influence.I am really glad to know that someone made a film record of his performances, and, that it is available.Clarence Darrow, as a labor lawyer, a criminal defense lawyer, and as a humanitarian, did much to raise the consciousness of our people as to the plight of the common man during the great depression.  Fonda, as an actor, contributed to this consciousness in some of the roles he played after the depression and through WWII.The Grapes of Wrath(John Ford Directed this 1940 film).  Together, Clarence Darrow's life and Henry Fonda's inspiring performance, lead us to understand how social consciousness is necessary in our current political, social and economic climate in the US.The monologue is filled with compelling arguments for compassion towards even the most disfavored citizens of our Country, and, it is filled with witty and inspiring quotes from Clarence Darrow:""As long as the world shall last there will be wrongs, and if no man objected and no man rebelled, those wrongs would last forever.""""I don't like spinach, and I'm glad I don't, because if I liked it I'd eat it, and I just hate it.""One of the vignettes in the monologue involves Darrow being confronted by a young reporter who remarked that Darrow always looked unkempt and disheveled.  Darrow responded:  ""Young man, I spend just as much money on my attire as you - the difference between us is that you take off your clothes when you go to sleep.""We easily lose sight of history without inspiration from protagonists such as Darrow, or, performers such as Henry Fonda.  We, as a nation, have lost sight of the freedoms we have abandoned in favor of ""law and order"" or ""trickle down economics.""  ""Law and Order, and ""trickle down economics"" are not new ideas.  They are the same ideas from the Great Depression that were used to oppress the common people, and preserve the abundance of this Nation for a select few.To Have and Have Not (Scribner Classics)[Hemingway 1937].  For a conservative view of social consciousness, similar to the views of Clarence Darrow, seeIt Is Dangerous to Be Right When the Government Is Wrong: The Case for Personal Freedom[Judge Napolitano]""History repeats itself, and that's one of the things that's wrong with history.""  - Clarence Darrow",5,Absolutely relevant for the 99% today,1345507200,"08 21, 2012",2012,2688,"['1975', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'performed', 'monologue', 'live', 'various', 'cities', 'U.S', 'film', 'version', 'live', 'theatre', 'performances.The', 'screenplay', 'monologue', 'based', 'Irving', 'Stone', '1971', 'biography', 'Clarence', 'Darrow', 'defense', 'biography', 'Bantam', 'biography', '.I', 'had', 'privilege', 'seeing', 'Mr.', 'Fonda', 'perform', 'live', 'monologue', 'Cleveland', 'Playhouse', 'Theater', '1975', 'was', 'young', 'was', 'inspiring', 'influence.I', 'am', 'really', 'glad', 'know', 'someone', 'made', 'film', 'record', 'performances', 'available.Clarence', 'Darrow', 'labor', 'lawyer', 'criminal', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'humanitarian', 'did', 'much', 'raise', 'consciousness', 'people', 'plight', 'common', 'man', 'great', 'depression', 'Fonda', 'actor', 'contributed', 'consciousness', 'roles', 'played', 'depression', 'WWII.The', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'John', 'Ford', 'Directed', '1940', 'film', 'Together', 'Clarence', 'Darrow', 'life', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'inspiring', 'performance', 'lead', 'understand', 'how', 'social', 'consciousness', 'necessary', 'current', 'political', 'social', 'economic', 'climate', 'US.The', 'monologue', 'filled', 'compelling', 'arguments', 'compassion', 'towards', 'even', 'most', 'disfavored', 'citizens', 'Country', 'filled', 'witty', 'inspiring', 'quotes', 'Clarence', 'Darrow', 'As', 'long', 'world', 'shall', 'last', 'will', 'be', 'wrongs', 'man', 'objected', 'man', 'rebelled', 'wrongs', 'would', 'last', 'forever', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'spinach', ""'m"", 'glad', 'do', ""n't"", 'liked', ""'d"", 'eat', 'just', 'hate', 'One', 'vignettes', 'monologue', 'Darrow', 'being', 'confronted', 'young', 'reporter', 'who', 'remarked', 'Darrow', 'always', 'looked', 'unkempt', 'disheveled', 'Darrow', 'responded', 'Young', 'man', 'spend', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'money', 'attire', 'difference', 'take', 'off', 'clothes', 'when', 'go', 'sleep', 'easily', 'lose', 'sight', 'history', 'inspiration', 'protagonists', 'such', 'Darrow', 'performers', 'such', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'nation', 'have', 'lost', 'sight', 'freedoms', 'have', 'abandoned', 'favor', 'law', 'order', 'trickle', 'economics', 'Law', 'Order', 'trickle', 'down', 'economics', 'are', 'not', 'new', 'ideas', 'are', 'same', 'ideas', 'Great', 'Depression', 'were', 'used', 'oppress', 'common', 'people', 'preserve', 'abundance', 'Nation', 'select', 'few.To', 'Have', 'Have', 'Not', 'Scribner', 'Classics', '[', 'Hemingway', '1937', ']', 'conservative', 'view', 'social', 'consciousness', 'similar', 'views', 'Clarence', 'Darrow', 'seeIt', 'Dangerous', 'Be', 'Right', 'When', 'Government', 'Wrong', 'Case', 'Personal', 'Freedom', '[', 'Judge', 'Napolitano', ']', 'History', 'one', 'things', 'wrong', 'history', 'Clarence', 'Darrow']",N/A

I liked it then, and I wouldn't mind seeing it again at all, but I think the price for this item is way out of my budget for a DVD that I would not watch more than once every few years. I saw Henry Fonda on Broadway in a forgettable comedy a few years earlier than this venture, and he was as impressive on a stage as he was on film. But you can buy two or three of his best film performances for the price of this item. As for Clarence Darrow, he was a fascinating man, but reading a biography would teach you more than this one script can.",5,A great actor portrays a great lawyer...,1158710400,"09 20, 2006",2006,612,"['one-man', 'show', 'was', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'more', '34', 'years', 'ago', 'liked', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'again', 'think', 'price', 'item', 'way', 'budget', 'DVD', 'would', 'not', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'few', 'years', 'saw', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Broadway', 'forgettable', 'comedy', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'venture', 'was', 'as', 'impressive', 'stage', 'was', 'film', 'can', 'buy', 'two', 'three', 'best', 'film', 'performances', 'price', 'item', 'Clarence', 'Darrow', 'was', 'fascinating', 'man', 'reading', 'biography', 'would', 'teach', 'more', 'one', 'script', 'can']",N/A
