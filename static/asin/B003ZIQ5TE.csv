If you like good music or good video games, this is definitely for you.

I knew they were recording but I thought they might record them all.  I enjoyed the show live and the recording. Some have said that they thought the discussions took away from the music.  Without the discussions you would lose the history that was being presented.  When the music is being played there is no discussion.  This is colorful, dynamic and exciting.  The Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra is featured in this show.  One can also buy the music on a DVD.  I have both.  Don't miss out on this gaming musical entwining visual and audio entertainment.

It's just hard to sit and watch the main sponsor (which is the only reason I can guess that he's allowed to stay there; he also introduces each song) spaz out for the entirety of the concert. He's given a baton to seem somewhat worthwhile, but the real conductor can be seen in his official chambers. Besides that, this is close to 4 hours (you heard me!) long. Also, most songs played are from obscure Sony PS1 titles that only the guy and the 2 people each in the audience who said, ""Whoo!"" for had ever heard of. The origional LEGEND OF ZELDA theme is there, so I can't discredit it totally; but I can't recommend it either.",2,"""Master of Ceremonies"" has to calm down!",1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,658,"['Overall', 'blu-ray', 'okay', 'just', 'hard', 'sit', 'watch', 'main', 'sponsor', 'only', 'reason', 'can', 'guess', 'allowed', 'stay', 'there', 'also', 'song', 'spaz', 'entirety', 'concert', 'given', 'baton', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'worthwhile', 'real', 'conductor', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'official', 'chambers', 'close', '4', 'hours', 'heard', 'long', 'Also', 'most', 'songs', 'played', 'are', 'obscure', 'Sony', 'PS1', 'only', 'guy', '2', 'people', 'audience', 'who', 'said', 'Whoo', 'had', 'ever', 'heard', 'origional', 'LEGEND', 'OF', 'ZELDA', 'theme', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'discredit', 'totally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend']",N/A

1377397,A1NN2Y8GYCNYGV,B003ZIQ5TE,R. Caymo,"[6, 6]","A little bit about the concert first; I have never been to a VG LIVE concert but I have been to a Final Fantasy ""Dear Friends"" and the recent ""Distant Worlds"" concert.  So picking this one up I knew what to expect.  Great music but familiar in a different light with all the cool (but cheesy) theatrics.  In all honesty, hearing your favorite gaming tunes in a live symphony and choir is truly an unforgettable if not inspiring experience.  Really, words cannot describe how these or in this case VG LIVE concerts are; IT IS SOMETHING TO BE EXPERIENCED FIRST HAND.However if you were unable to make the concerts, Shout Factory was kind enough to grace us with this BD/DVD combo for your home viewing experience.PRESENTATION:I am one for the full home theater immersion of a live concert with no interruptions (except to what is actually happening at the concert) but I am not too fond with the side commentary before each presentation.  They should of had an option to watch the concert without commentary. Not experience ruining for most but that is just me, it feels a bit disjointed.VIDEO:Despite what the box labels (1080p) this concert is encoded in 1080i. Surprisingly though, this is a very clean transfer that would rank next to other great Live Concerts such as Rush, NIN, Incubus, Within Temptation, etc. Though sometimes it does look a bit soft in some shots, that is to be expected in a low lighted environment. But definitely for the most part it is an eye pleasing and crisp picture.AUDIO: DTS-MAIf you are expecting an aural experience as with most great live concert BDs, VG LIVE somewhat fails in this department. For the most part it trumps the clarity and projection found in standard DTS counterpart. But what you really getting is a front heavy assault with the surrounds left for the audience.  Most live BDs achieve the envelop sensation almost perfect, this one not so much.  Maybe this was by design, but it sounds more like a Jazz Club rather than an Amphitheater. It is a bit disappointing, but overall the great music lets you hear past this.EXTRAS:Loads of extras on this one! If you are an old school gamer like me, you will probably appreciate the interview with Ralph Baer (Father of Video games), the making of Dragon's Lair, and the documentary on Tetris. But other than that there are bunch of behind the scenes and interviews.Overall I would say pick this one up. Whether you are a BD enthusiast, musician, gamer (of course), you will enjoy this 100%.  These concerts stand apart from many others you will ever see. Check it out!",4,Great concert but an average BD,1287446400,"10 19, 2010",2010,2565,"['little', 'bit', 'concert', 'first', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'VG', 'LIVE', 'concert', 'have', 'been', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Dear', 'Friends', 'recent', 'Distant', 'Worlds', 'concert', 'So', 'picking', 'one', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'Great', 'music', 'familiar', 'different', 'light', 'cool', 'cheesy', 'theatrics', 'honesty', 'hearing', 'favorite', 'gaming', 'tunes', 'live', 'symphony', 'choir', 'truly', 'unforgettable', 'not', 'inspiring', 'experience', 'Really', 'words', 'can', 'not', 'describe', 'how', 'case', 'VG', 'LIVE', 'concerts', 'are', 'IT', 'SOMETHING', 'TO', 'BE', 'EXPERIENCED', 'FIRST', 'HAND.However', 'were', 'unable', 'make', 'concerts', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'was', 'kind', 'enough', 'grace', 'BD/DVD', 'combo', 'home', 'viewing', 'experience.PRESENTATION', 'am', 'one', 'full', 'home', 'theater', 'immersion', 'live', 'concert', 'interruptions', 'what', 'actually', 'happening', 'concert', 'am', 'not', 'too', 'fond', 'side', 'commentary', 'presentation', 'should', 'had', 'option', 'watch', 'concert', 'commentary', 'Not', 'experience', 'ruining', 'most', 'just', 'bit', 'disjointed.VIDEO', 'what', 'box', 'labels', '1080p', 'concert', 'encoded', '1080i', 'Surprisingly', 'very', 'clean', 'transfer', 'would', 'rank', 'next', 'other', 'great', 'Live', 'Concerts', 'such', 'Rush', 'NIN', 'Incubus', 'Within', 'Temptation', 'etc', 'sometimes', 'look', 'bit', 'soft', 'shots', 'be', 'expected', 'low', 'lighted', 'environment', 'definitely', 'most', 'part', 'eye', 'pleasing', 'crisp', 'picture.AUDIO', 'DTS-MAIf', 'are', 'expecting', 'aural', 'experience', 'most', 'great', 'live', 'concert', 'BDs', 'VG', 'LIVE', 'somewhat', 'department', 'most', 'part', 'clarity', 'projection', 'found', 'standard', 'DTS', 'counterpart', 'what', 'really', 'getting', 'front', 'heavy', 'assault', 'surrounds', 'left', 'audience', 'Most', 'live', 'BDs', 'achieve', 'envelop', 'sensation', 'almost', 'perfect', 'one', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Maybe', 'was', 'design', 'more', 'Jazz', 'Club', 'rather', 'Amphitheater', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'great', 'music', 'hear', 'past', 'this.EXTRAS', 'Loads', 'extras', 'one', 'are', 'old', 'school', 'gamer', 'will', 'probably', 'appreciate', 'interview', 'Ralph', 'Baer', 'Father', 'Video', 'games', 'making', 'Dragon', 'Lair', 'documentary', 'Tetris', 'other', 'are', 'bunch', 'scenes', 'interviews.Overall', 'would', 'say', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'are', 'BD', 'enthusiast', 'musician', 'gamer', 'course', 'will', 'enjoy', '100', '%', 'concerts', 'stand', 'apart', 'many', 'others', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'Check', 'out']",N/A
