And be sure to catch young James Dean at the soda fountain (uncredited).

1011625,ASBGPDCWRP11A,B000HA4WSO,"DLHSmith ""DLHS""","[4, 6]","The Spiral Road was one of my favorite movies when I was high school and college. It wasn't a ""popular"" or terribly huge box office success, but the theme is wonderful, and I believe it remains one of Rock Hudson's absolute best performances. It's theme is we all need each other, and we need God. The scene that just brings sobs to me every time I see it - is the ""Aha"" moment, where Dr. Anton Drager comes to a realization that he does need help. If you read Daniel 4 in the Bible, you'll see a close parallel between King Nebuchadnezzar and Dr. Anton Drager. Thankfully, Dr. Drager doesn't spend seven years as a madman, maybe only a few weeks. But the outcome is the same.The moments are very powerful and the cast is terrific. You have the beautiful Gena Rowlands as Else, the love of Anton's life, ""Honeylamb"" according to Dr. Brits Jensen, the foremost expert on leprosy. He is wonderfully played by Burl Ives, who can go from very serious to very humorous and back again in the course of the movie. There are many other notable performances in the film as well, in smaller parts. The witchdoctor you'll recognize as the assassin from ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" (Doris Day and James Stewart version). He is appropriately creepy.One of my favorite characters was the long-suffering, yet non-judgmental and humble Dr. Willem Waters of the Salvation Army. He responds well to persecution and mockery. He took responsibility for any quarrels, even though they weren't his fault. I totally appreciated that as an example of what real humility looks like.I did watch The Golden Blade, A Very Special Favor, and Has Anybody Seen My Gal. They're OK. I really liked Has Anybody Seen My Gal, and I thought The Golden Blade was a lark.But I bought this because it is the only place you can get The Spiral Road. That movie has the best message, the best cast, and I believe will linger long with you after you see it. It's been nearly 40 years since I saw it the first time - and I was so thrilled to be able to get it on DVD.",5,Buy it for The Spiral Road alone,1272240000,"04 26, 2010",2010,2022,"['Spiral', 'Road', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'was', ""n't"", 'popular', 'terribly', 'huge', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'theme', 'wonderful', 'believe', 'one', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'absolute', 'best', 'performances', 'theme', 'need', 'other', 'need', 'God', 'scene', 'just', 'sobs', 'time', 'see', 'Aha', 'moment', 'where', 'Dr.', 'Anton', 'Drager', 'realization', 'need', 'help', 'read', 'Daniel', '4', 'Bible', ""'ll"", 'see', 'close', 'parallel', 'King', 'Nebuchadnezzar', 'Dr.', 'Anton', 'Drager', 'Thankfully', 'Dr.', 'Drager', ""n't"", 'spend', 'seven', 'years', 'madman', 'maybe', 'only', 'few', 'weeks', 'outcome', 'same.The', 'moments', 'are', 'very', 'powerful', 'cast', 'terrific', 'have', 'beautiful', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'Else', 'love', 'Anton', 'life', 'Honeylamb', 'according', 'Dr.', 'Brits', 'Jensen', 'foremost', 'expert', 'leprosy', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'who', 'can', 'go', 'very', 'serious', 'very', 'humorous', 'back', 'again', 'course', 'movie', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'notable', 'performances', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'smaller', 'parts', 'witchdoctor', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'assassin', 'Man', 'Who', 'Knew', 'Too', 'Much', 'Doris', 'Day', 'James', 'Stewart', 'version', 'appropriately', 'creepy.One', 'favorite', 'characters', 'was', 'long-suffering', 'non-judgmental', 'humble', 'Dr.', 'Willem', 'Waters', 'Salvation', 'Army', 'well', 'persecution', 'mockery', 'took', 'responsibility', 'quarrels', 'even', 'were', ""n't"", 'fault', 'totally', 'appreciated', 'example', 'what', 'real', 'humility', 'like.I', 'did', 'watch', 'Golden', 'Blade', 'A', 'Very', 'Special', 'Favor', 'Has', 'Anybody', 'Seen', 'My', 'Gal', ""'re"", 'OK', 'really', 'liked', 'Has', 'Anybody', 'Seen', 'My', 'Gal', 'thought', 'Golden', 'Blade', 'was', 'lark.But', 'bought', 'only', 'place', 'can', 'get', 'Spiral', 'Road', 'movie', 'best', 'message', 'best', 'cast', 'believe', 'will', 'linger', 'long', 'see', 'been', 'nearly', '40', 'years', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'so', 'thrilled', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'DVD']",Rock Hudson Screen Legend Collection: (The Golden Blade / Has Anybody Seen My Gal? / The Last Sunset / The Spiral Road / A Very Special Favor)

1011628,A2FSUQFE2K8R8R,B000HA4WSO,"Fiona Lowther ""book lover""","[5, 8]","Rock Hudson fans probably won't care whether any movie he's in is good or bad; they just want to drool over his hunkiness.Somebody at the studio decided to put Hudson in a costume pic and ""The Golden Blade"" was the sad result. He tried, but had nothing to work with.""Has Anybody Seen My Gal"" is a vehicle for Charles Coburn, and Rock doesn't have a big role.  ""A Very Special Favor"" doesn't do anybody a favor.  It's a mishmash that can't make up its mind whether it's a comedy, a romance or just something to give Hudson, Leslie Caron and Charles Boyer (as Caron's father) something to do while the cameras are rolling.But  ""The Last Sunset"" and ""The Spiral Road"" are worth the price, especially the latter.In ""Last Sunset"" Hudson does an interesting, well-reined-in job in a John Wayne-type role, and he and Kirk Douglas manage to retain the viewer's interest in this somewhat different Western.  Dorothy Malone and Carol Lynley hold up their end of the film.  All in all, it makes one wish Hudson had done more roles of this type; he might have picked up where John Wayne left off.Not everyone will like ""The Spiral Road"" but those who do will find it a gem.  It's a magnificently filmed adaptation of Jan de Hartog's novel about an atheistic Dutch doctor (Hudson) in the pre-WW II East Indies.  Gena Rowlands is believable as the love interest, and Burl Ives darn near runs away with the film as a crusty old doctor who's an expert in leprosy.It's another of those films that make one realize that had Hudson been given more good roles, he could've set the world on fire with his acting, instead of his good looks.  But one can't totally blame the studio; legend has it that Hudson turned down ""Ben Hur,"" ""Bridges at Toko-Ri"" and ""Sayonara.""According to the late Hollywood columnist Shirley Eder, Hudson wanted to buy ""The Rosary Murders,"" but the agent had sold it two weeks earlier.  Mystery buffs may entertain themselves imagining Hudson as William Kienzle's priest-detective, Father Koesler, eventually played by Donald Sutherland.",4,rock hudson,1267660800,"03 4, 2010",2010,2040,"['Rock', 'Hudson', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'good', 'bad', 'just', 'want', 'drool', 'hunkiness.Somebody', 'studio', 'decided', 'put', 'Hudson', 'costume', 'pic', 'Golden', 'Blade', 'was', 'sad', 'result', 'tried', 'had', 'nothing', 'work', 'Has', 'Anybody', 'Seen', 'My', 'Gal', 'vehicle', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'Rock', ""n't"", 'have', 'big', 'role', 'Very', 'Special', 'Favor', ""n't"", 'do', 'anybody', 'favor', 'mishmash', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'comedy', 'romance', 'just', 'something', 'give', 'Hudson', 'Leslie', 'Caron', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'Caron', 'father', 'something', 'do', 'cameras', 'are', 'rolling.But', 'Last', 'Sunset', 'Spiral', 'Road', 'are', 'price', 'especially', 'latter.In', 'Last', 'Sunset', 'Hudson', 'interesting', 'well-reined-in', 'job', 'John', 'Wayne-type', 'role', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'manage', 'retain', 'viewer', 'interest', 'somewhat', 'different', 'Western', 'Dorothy', 'Malone', 'Carol', 'Lynley', 'hold', 'up', 'end', 'film', 'one', 'wish', 'Hudson', 'had', 'done', 'more', 'roles', 'type', 'might', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'where', 'John', 'Wayne', 'left', 'off.Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'like', 'Spiral', 'Road', 'who', 'do', 'will', 'find', 'gem', 'magnificently', 'filmed', 'adaptation', 'Jan', 'de', 'Hartog', 'novel', 'atheistic', 'Dutch', 'doctor', 'Hudson', 'pre-WW', 'II', 'East', 'Indies', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'believable', 'love', 'interest', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'darn', 'away', 'film', 'crusty', 'old', 'doctor', 'who', 'expert', 'leprosy.It', 'films', 'make', 'one', 'realize', 'had', 'Hudson', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'good', 'roles', 'could', ""'ve"", 'set', 'world', 'fire', 'acting', 'instead', 'good', 'looks', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'totally', 'blame', 'studio', 'legend', 'Hudson', 'turned', 'down', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'Bridges', 'Toko-Ri', 'Sayonara', 'According', 'late', 'Hollywood', 'columnist', 'Shirley', 'Eder', 'Hudson', 'wanted', 'buy', 'Rosary', 'Murders', 'agent', 'had', 'sold', 'two', 'weeks', 'earlier', 'Mystery', 'buffs', 'may', 'entertain', 'imagining', 'Hudson', 'William', 'Kienzle', 'priest-detective', 'Father', 'Koesler', 'eventually', 'played', 'Donald', 'Sutherland']",Rock Hudson Screen Legend Collection: (The Golden Blade / Has Anybody Seen My Gal? / The Last Sunset / The Spiral Road / A Very Special Favor)

Carol Lynley (smokin'hot), Jack Elam and Neville Brand.If you wonder why I site this as a ""Kirk Douglas Movie"" it's because he has the Lead Role of Brenden O'Malley, a Wild at Heart drifter who seeks to regain the Heart of Belle, played by Dorothy Malone, who now lives in Mexico with her Cattle Rancher Husband (Joseph Cotton), Hot on O'Malley's trail is Rock Hudson, a US Marshal who plans to take O'Malley back to Texas to Stand Trial for Murdering his Brother-In-Law.

1011637,A27JAIYP0U9FGH,B000HA4WSO,PJR,"[12, 15]","PLOT SPOILERSpiral road turned out to be an excellent, thoughtful film. It was too long in obscurity. Hudson plays an ambitious doctor and top competitive athlete who feels utterly self-confident. He is not sympathetic to people who can't handle life without community or for example religion.The film has lush tropical atmosphere in color, but such a view of humanity is the core issue here.Ives is the crusty old world expert on leprosy who is too busy treating patients and coping with jungle life to publish his stack of research findings. He maintains a tough exterior but gains deep respect and affection for Hudson, that he tries to conceal.PLOT SPOILERToward the remarkable ending Hudson cracks under quite strange but believable psychological pressures. He is being outwitted and starts making dumb mistakes as any human might under such alien circumsances. If you are the sort who thinks YOU wound never ever make such mistakes, forget this film. Anyway he falls apart mentally out alone in the jungle. He has to be rescued. All that saves him is that other human beings who love him more than he loves them have come to care about him. It is implied  that he comes to realize that loving human bonds are not simply weaknesses but are critical to human survival and give meaning to life.Elsewhere I read that the film is about atheism versus religious belief. The film does involve missionaries who run a leper colony, Hudson's disdain for religion, and it does end with a quote from the Bible, but the overall characterization is misleading. All these elements largely raise issues for the viewer to ponder. For example suppose Hudson's scientific arguments were correct, and the religious position was wrong. So what? -- Apparently what was really important was the love component in religion as it was presented in the film in the context of care for the lepers and the importance of personal bonds among the doctors in tough situations at the edge of survival. I don't know the book, and it is not impossible that the author originally had a different objective, and that Hudson would have found God in the end. But that was not how the film developed the story.Hudson and others did quite respectable jobs of acting. Some would say he was out of character, but I would say that the film is rather unusual in any event and any famous actor might seem out of character for some viewers. I liked the way he played the role, however. Gratefully, the actors did not overplay and trivialize the points that I just made. I liked the dialogue. There were some nice thought provoking lines.This is quite simply a thought provoking film -- it is not an action or adventure film. It is not the usual sort of drama. It is not an inspirational religious film about conversion. It is difficult to put it into the usual categories without raising misleading expectations.",5,Spiral Road surprise,1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,2871,"['PLOT', 'SPOILERSpiral', 'road', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'excellent', 'thoughtful', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'obscurity', 'Hudson', 'ambitious', 'doctor', 'top', 'competitive', 'athlete', 'who', 'utterly', 'self-confident', 'not', 'sympathetic', 'people', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'life', 'community', 'example', 'religion.The', 'film', 'lush', 'tropical', 'atmosphere', 'color', 'view', 'humanity', 'core', 'issue', 'crusty', 'old', 'world', 'expert', 'leprosy', 'who', 'too', 'busy', 'treating', 'patients', 'coping', 'jungle', 'life', 'publish', 'stack', 'research', 'findings', 'tough', 'exterior', 'gains', 'deep', 'respect', 'affection', 'Hudson', 'conceal.PLOT', 'SPOILERToward', 'remarkable', 'ending', 'Hudson', 'cracks', 'quite', 'strange', 'believable', 'psychological', 'pressures', 'being', 'outwitted', 'making', 'dumb', 'mistakes', 'human', 'might', 'such', 'alien', 'circumsances', 'are', 'sort', 'who', 'YOU', 'wound', 'never', 'ever', 'make', 'such', 'mistakes', 'forget', 'film', 'Anyway', 'apart', 'mentally', 'out', 'alone', 'jungle', 'be', 'rescued', 'other', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'love', 'more', 'have', 'come', 'care', 'implied', 'realize', 'loving', 'human', 'bonds', 'are', 'not', 'simply', 'weaknesses', 'are', 'critical', 'human', 'survival', 'give', 'meaning', 'life.Elsewhere', 'read', 'film', 'atheism', 'versus', 'religious', 'belief', 'film', 'involve', 'missionaries', 'who', 'run', 'leper', 'colony', 'Hudson', 'disdain', 'religion', 'end', 'quote', 'Bible', 'overall', 'characterization', 'misleading', 'elements', 'largely', 'raise', 'issues', 'viewer', 'ponder', 'example', 'suppose', 'Hudson', 'scientific', 'arguments', 'were', 'correct', 'religious', 'position', 'was', 'wrong', 'what', 'Apparently', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'important', 'was', 'love', 'component', 'religion', 'was', 'presented', 'film', 'context', 'care', 'lepers', 'importance', 'personal', 'bonds', 'doctors', 'tough', 'situations', 'edge', 'survival', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'book', 'not', 'impossible', 'author', 'originally', 'had', 'different', 'objective', 'Hudson', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'God', 'end', 'was', 'not', 'how', 'film', 'developed', 'story.Hudson', 'others', 'did', 'quite', 'respectable', 'jobs', 'acting', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'character', 'would', 'say', 'film', 'rather', 'unusual', 'event', 'famous', 'actor', 'might', 'seem', 'character', 'viewers', 'liked', 'way', 'played', 'role', 'however', 'Gratefully', 'actors', 'did', 'not', 'overplay', 'trivialize', 'points', 'just', 'made', 'liked', 'dialogue', 'were', 'nice', 'thought', 'provoking', 'lines.This', 'quite', 'simply', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'not', 'action', 'adventure', 'film', 'not', 'usual', 'sort', 'drama', 'not', 'inspirational', 'religious', 'film', 'conversion', 'difficult', 'put', 'usual', 'categories', 'raising', 'misleading', 'expectations']",Rock Hudson Screen Legend Collection: (The Golden Blade / Has Anybody Seen My Gal? / The Last Sunset / The Spiral Road / A Very Special Favor)

I think that he was the first handsome man, that I'd ever seen! Rock Hudson is one good looking, beautiful man! Wow! He is my all-time favorite handsome leading man, and  to this day, I have not seen anyone out do Rock!In this movie collection HAS ANYBODY SEEN MY GAL, is a very good movie, it gives you a idea of how it was with the roaring 20's, college era, and about people who have money, and the people who don't! I loved the funny, old man who was the secret, rich, millionare! I enjoyed it!And my favorite was THE GOLDEN BLADE, I just loved it, and I loved the chemisty between Rock Hudson, and Piper Laurie, who played the beautiful princess! This movie I will watch again, it is your classic romantic, love story, with your dashing handsome hero(Rock Hudson), that saves the princess, and her kingdom!The movie A VERY SPECIAL FAVOR, reminded me of some of Rock Hudson's movies with Doris Day, but in this movie Leslie Caron was the leading lady, and of course Rock was your handsome playboy! I loved the man who was the matchmaking father, who was trying to fix up his beautiful daughter, with Rock!I just loved this movie THE LAST SUNSET! Kirk Douglas was the handsome outlaw, and Rock Hudson was the handsome cowboy hero! Wow! Rock Hudson as a cowboy! My favorite scene in the movie was when Rock Hudson moved the wagon to point to the north star, so that he could seek the attentions of the pretty widow Belle, who was in the wagon.But the movie that touched my heart was THE SPIRAL ROAD, I love Burl Ives ,he is always one of my favorite actors, he is simply outstanding! No one can out do Burl! But Rock Hudson surprised me in this film, he show me that he was more than a handsome leading man, he showed me what a outstanding, talented man he really was, in the scene where he gets lost in the jungle, standing in the water, with tears in his eyes touching his reflection in the water, and realizing that it was his reflection in the water, staring back at him, that scene was awesome!

This allows for better quality unlike the dual-sided discs crammed with up to four movies a disc.While this collection features rare Rock Hudson movies, I must say the entertainment value is well worth the expense. At about 4 or 5 dollars a movie, it's cheaper than a movie ticket. AND YOU GET TO KEEP THEM! With this release also came out similar collections of Cary Grant and Bing Crosby. Unfortunately, there is some technical skipping or stoppage in one of the Cary Grant discs--the only technical malfunction so far as I still have more of the collections to watch. (Skipping and stopping has been an issue with Universals Franchise Collection DVD packaging for awhile now, but slowly it's getting better.)The packaging is nicely done with some interesting side notes on each film inside the casing. However, there is a misquote on the three films he did with Doris Day (at least in my copy there is). It states the three movies Rock did with Doris were Pillow Talk, Lover Come Back, and &lt;EM>Come September&lt;/EM>?
