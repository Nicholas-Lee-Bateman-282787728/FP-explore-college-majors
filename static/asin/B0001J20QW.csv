In 1977, the success of Ed Asner in The Gathering helped to carve out this whole genre of holiday movies.If you're old enough to have appreciated The Gathering when it first aired, then you may be thinking about another holiday landmark in 1970s television. The Granddaddy of all family-reunion-at-the-holidays TV movies was the 1971 movieThe Homecoming: A Christmas Storythat led to the long-running Waltons TV series.Of course, the friction and anxiety in The Homecoming was nothing compared to the heavy-duty themes penned by The Gathering screenwriter James Poe, who also wroteLilies of the FieldandThey Shoot Horses, Don't They?Sure, some moments in The Gathering are dated, today. Asner's most explosive confrontation is with a son who fled to Canada rather than fight in Vietnam, after all. But it's still a pleasure to watch this cast bring Poe's taught drama to life.

The emotional subplots deal with the family's mixed feelings regarding their parents' separation and the potential fireworks which may occur, the reunion of the clan and the many fences Adam needs to mend before he dies- without telling the family of his illness. It does sound a little moribund and yet...the teleplay by James Poe brings the warmth of the holiday season to the fore, as each family member finds love and healing. The production won an Emmy award for outstanding drama and should have received more for the excellent performances by Asner and Stapleton.This film has become a holiday viewing staple in my home since its premiere thirty years ago, and brings joy and tears with a profound holiday glow to my entire family. I can't recommend it highly enough.The sequel, The Gathering part II, is a dreary excuse for a holiday film, failing to capture the glow of its predecessor. Some of the original cast, including Marueen Stapleton, Rebecca Balding and Lawrence Pressman reprise their roles. Good as a curiosity, no more.

807905,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,B0001J20QW,Simon Davis,"[57, 57]","I first became acquainted with this highly moving 1977 Christmas Television movie during one Christmas season in the mid 1980's when it was shown late on Christmas Eve. I immediately fell in love with its simple story filled with much identifiable human drama, great characters and first rate performances by all cast members. Christmas is often a time of reflection and efforts by families to come together despite their conflicts and differences during the past year and the storyline of ""The Gathering"", uses these very issues to perfection in its beautifully thought out screenplay. ""The Gathering"", centres its story around one man's recently diagnosed terminal illness which makes him reflect on his wasted life where ambition and the obsession to succeed in big business has cost him not only his wife, his children and his home, but also his inner sense of self worth. Ed Asner still best remembered for his role on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", here takes on a very different kind of role as driven business man Adam Thornton who with only a few months left to live enlists the help of his long estranged wife Kate, (a superb Maureen Stapleton), to gather together for one last Christmas, his four children whose love he sacrificed in his quest for business success. What unfolds is a beautifully crafted tale highlighting the power of forgiveness and family unity against all odds, and while it is indeed on the sentimental side ( which I love incidently!), the film also never shies away from illustrating many all too common human failings and the harmful effects they can often have on those we love.I firmly believe that very few present day movies dealing with the often complex relationships existing within families come anywhere near the emotional impact that ""The Gathering"" delivers. It really comes from what I can now see as the ""Golden Age"", of television movies in the 1970's and 1980's and at its premiere screening for Christmas 1977 was a great success with both viewers and critics earning a coveted Emmy Award for that year as Best Television Movie. That great acclaim and success led to a sequel two years titled simply ""Gathering 2"", that focused on Kate finding a new man played by Efrem Zimbalist Jr, entering her life at Christmas time. Both these films are amazingly not available on DVD as of Christmas 2007 which is such a major disappointment considering the much loved reputation of the original film which has only ever been available in sub-standard EP VHS editions. Much of the film's memorable quality is due to the near perfect chemistry of veteran performers Ed Asner and Maureen Stapleton and this film deserves to be released properly for a new audience to be able to enjoy it. Try to seek out ""The Gathering"", during this coming Christmas season as it is an emotional viewing experience you wont regret and which I know I cherish every year at this time.",5,Superb Christmas Drama Highlighting One Family's Forgiveness And Compassion,1195257600,"11 17, 2007",2007,2901,"['first', 'became', 'acquainted', 'highly', 'moving', '1977', 'Christmas', 'Television', 'movie', 'one', 'Christmas', 'season', 'mid', '1980', 'when', 'was', 'shown', 'late', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'immediately', 'fell', 'love', 'simple', 'story', 'filled', 'much', 'identifiable', 'human', 'drama', 'great', 'characters', 'first', 'rate', 'performances', 'cast', 'members', 'Christmas', 'often', 'time', 'reflection', 'efforts', 'families', 'come', 'together', 'conflicts', 'differences', 'past', 'year', 'storyline', 'Gathering', 'very', 'issues', 'perfection', 'beautifully', 'thought', 'out', 'screenplay', 'Gathering', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'recently', 'diagnosed', 'terminal', 'illness', 'reflect', 'wasted', 'life', 'where', 'ambition', 'obsession', 'succeed', 'big', 'business', 'cost', 'not', 'only', 'wife', 'children', 'home', 'also', 'inner', 'sense', 'self', 'worth', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'still', 'best', 'remembered', 'role', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'here', 'very', 'different', 'kind', 'role', 'driven', 'business', 'man', 'Adam', 'Thornton', 'who', 'only', 'few', 'months', 'left', 'live', 'enlists', 'help', 'long', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Kate', 'superb', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'gather', 'together', 'one', 'last', 'Christmas', 'four', 'children', 'love', 'sacrificed', 'quest', 'business', 'success', 'What', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'tale', 'highlighting', 'power', 'forgiveness', 'family', 'unity', 'odds', 'indeed', 'sentimental', 'side', 'love', 'incidently', 'film', 'also', 'never', 'away', 'illustrating', 'many', 'too', 'common', 'human', 'failings', 'harmful', 'effects', 'can', 'often', 'have', 'love.I', 'firmly', 'believe', 'very', 'few', 'present', 'day', 'movies', 'dealing', 'often', 'complex', 'relationships', 'existing', 'families', 'come', 'anywhere', 'emotional', 'impact', 'Gathering', 'delivers', 'really', 'what', 'can', 'now', 'see', 'Golden', 'Age', 'television', 'movies', '1970', '1980', 'premiere', 'screening', 'Christmas', '1977', 'was', 'great', 'success', 'viewers', 'critics', 'earning', 'coveted', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'year', 'Best', 'Television', 'Movie', 'great', 'acclaim', 'success', 'led', 'sequel', 'two', 'years', 'titled', 'simply', 'Gathering', '2', 'focused', 'Kate', 'finding', 'new', 'man', 'played', 'Efrem', 'Zimbalist', 'Jr', 'entering', 'life', 'Christmas', 'time', 'films', 'are', 'amazingly', 'not', 'available', 'DVD', 'Christmas', '2007', 'major', 'disappointment', 'considering', 'much', 'loved', 'reputation', 'original', 'film', 'only', 'ever', 'been', 'available', 'sub-standard', 'EP', 'VHS', 'editions', 'Much', 'film', 'memorable', 'quality', 'due', 'near', 'perfect', 'chemistry', 'veteran', 'performers', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'film', 'be', 'released', 'properly', 'new', 'audience', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'Try', 'seek', 'out', 'Gathering', 'coming', 'Christmas', 'season', 'emotional', 'viewing', 'experience', 'wont', 'regret', 'know', 'cherish', 'year', 'time']",N/A
