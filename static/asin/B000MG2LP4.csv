This movie was very suspenseful and interesting. It is very graphic though and has scenes I cringed at. That makes you all the more want them to escape. I agree with another reviewer in that you are routing for her but at times don't totally agree with her methods. I was curious to how historically accurate the movie was after watching and read about her online. I saw that they did add some things for the sake of drama to the story and changed various details. I didn't think they should've changed those details just to make the movie more interesting because the real story is interesting also. I think it was very worth watching but its one of the kind I watch once and am finished with because I don't often enjoy movies with much violence or open sex which this has. I was glued to watching this till the end though and even couldn't help but shed a few tears near the ending which I never do. It has some what of a bittersweet ending.

Maybe the other reviewers belong to the new wave of puritanism that seems to be spreading particularly in the US...? interested to hear a bit elaboration from those who were so taken a back ?It was well acted and it was nice to see that both the convicts and soldiers were shown as human i.e. with good and more dark sides forming a more realistic picture than many period films where the characters are often entirely good or bad.Without disclosing anything was I disappointed with the rather abrupt ending leaving too much for the viewer to assume - considering it is based on a true story it is natural to want to know a bit more as to what followed.

Fortunately, this drama had a happy ending, except for all those who died on the way. I thoroughly enjoyed the acting and brilliant, natural colors of the movie.This film is important since Mary Bryant's story played an important part in reducing the extreme sentencing guidelines used by the English bench.

She's a great actress who I've also seen in a Brit production of Jane Austens Emma (she was a million times better than Gwyneth Paltrow in that part).Here she plays the part with real fire and also makes you believe totally in what her character is going through.The rest of the cast are great. Jack Davenport is excellent and Sam Neill is good as always.The other actor who really stood out was Alex O'Loughlin who plays will Bryant. He was amazing in this and his final scene was just sublime. I've never seen so many emotions cross an actors face in one shot - ever. My heart was in my mouth watching his reactions to what was happening.The story is genuinely heartbreaking (and some of the more horrible stuff portrayed here really happened, which makes it so much harder to watch).This is one of the best tv dramas I've seen in a very long time and I can't reccommned it enough.",5,Fantastic drama,1308096000,"06 15, 2011",2011,1101,"['film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Mary', 'Bryant', 'life', 'take', 'artistic', 'licence', 'facts', '.The', 'whole', 'cast', 'are', 'amazing', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'really', 'heroine', 'title', 'great', 'actress', 'who', ""'ve"", 'also', 'seen', 'Brit', 'production', 'Jane', 'Austens', 'Emma', 'was', 'million', 'times', 'better', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'part', 'part', 'real', 'fire', 'also', 'believe', 'totally', 'what', 'character', 'going', 'through.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'great', 'Jack', 'Davenport', 'excellent', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'good', 'always.The', 'other', 'actor', 'who', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'Alex', ""O'Loughlin"", 'who', 'plays', 'will', 'Bryant', 'was', 'amazing', 'final', 'scene', 'was', 'just', 'sublime', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'emotions', 'cross', 'actors', 'face', 'one', 'shot', 'ever', 'heart', 'was', 'mouth', 'watching', 'reactions', 'what', 'was', 'happening.The', 'story', 'genuinely', 'heartbreaking', 'more', 'horrible', 'stuff', 'portrayed', 'here', 'really', 'happened', 'so', 'much', 'harder', 'watch', '.This', 'one', 'best', 'tv', 'dramas', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reccommned', 'enough']",The Incredible Journey of Mary Bryant

1045907,A2GOKFQGLRBXUB,B000MG2LP4,TruAim,"[2, 2]","This is a made-for-TV 3-hour movie and it's excellent.  An exciting true-life story.  Excellent production values (especially for a TV movie).  First-rate acting.  Actress Romola Garai (who plays the lead) is fabulous as Mary Bryant.  She nails every acting level perfectly, and there's so many levels--frightened, heart-broken, shattered, courageous, tough, sweet, plucky, deceptive, conniving, selfish, a leader, a loving mother, a good wife, a heroine.  She does an outstanding job.  And actor Jack Davenport is, as always, pitch-perfect as a 1700s British officer--he was born to play these types of roles.  The story is very much like Papillon--an incredibly daring, true-life adventurous escape story from an island prison.  You will be routing for Mary and her family.  Some reviews have mentioned the brief nudity and rape scene.  Though this scene may not be suitable for children, rest assured it is brief and fairly mild.  It is not one of those stylistically brutal and intense rape scenes that are hard to endure.  In fact, it's odd they even put the brief nudity and rape scene in, because it's out of context with the rest of the movie which plays like a PG-13 movie.
