With Don Johnson, of all people!So what do you get when you throw John Goodman, Melanie Griffith, and the effeminately voiced Don Johnson into a bowl, simmer on high for about 2 hours, and then stir it all up?  You get fun stew, that's what you get, and ""Born Yesterday"" is the rare exception of a remake that bests the original by leaps and bounds.If you haven't seen it, then you really should drop everything that you're doing right now and buy ""Born Yesterday.""  Don't rent it.  Renting is for suckas.  Besides, you'll probably rent it, think it's the most incredible movie of all time, and then kick yourself because you could have just have bought it to begin with.  So my advice, friend, is spare the self-kicking and just plunk down the $79.00 or however much DVDs cost (I don't know how much they go for these days, because I purchase all my DVDs on the streets while they're still in theaters.  As illegal bootlegs--that's how I buy them all.  It's more efficient that way).Anyway, in this movie Melanie Griffith is a fish-out-of-water, similar to when she was a Working Girl fish-out-of-water, or when she was a Shining Through fish-out-of-water, but completely dissimilar to when she was a Bonfire of the Vanities fish-out-of-water.  She injects into every character she plays, thankfully, that wonderfully crispy and fun-loving voice that is only slightly deeper than Don Johnson's.You will only not like this movie if your movie taste is bad or if you are Antonio Banderas.

If I had never seen the original or if the original was not one of my favorite movies, I may have rated it higher, because the story and the acting are good.  But the original is a classic and, in my opinion, a movie should only be remade if the original can be improved on, and this one doesn't meet that standard.  The best part of this movie is the ingenious song about some of the Amendments to the Constitution sung to the tune of ""The Twelve Days of Christmas.""

735999,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B00008977E,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[8, 9]","What holds this movie together is Melanie Griffith, a deliberate and thoughtful actress. Add the handsome Don Johnson as the teacher/reporter and  John Goodman, the hard-boiled, no nonsense businessman and you have a winner.This movie is a study in so many things: self-respect, respect for others, integrity, dignity, and the beauty of brains. When Billie (Melanie) tells Paul (Don) that she can get anything she wants from Harry (John), she reveals her lack of understanding of self-worth: she wants a mink coat and gets it because she gives him what he wants. By movie's end she wants more and has earned the self-respect and determination to get it.The whole education aspect (""smarten up"" Billie so she won't be an embarrassment while Harry is in Washington, D.C.) serves as a wonderful example to viewers of the power of knowledge. Harry hires Paul, who sets Billie off on an educational journey that jump starts her unused brain. First, she reads a book that no one actually reads--Alexis de Toqueville. She increases her vocabulary. She acquires culture through the art in the National Gallery of Art, especially focusing on a Van Gogh painting that depicts the dignity of manual labor, a reminder of her father.Billie questions later what she should do with this new, profound awareness. The status quo is easy to maintain; change is always difficult. In this case, with change come a new self-respect and self-confidence. The new Billie will marry Paul. If it seems she is trading one man for another,  that is misleading because this particular man encourages her growth, in fact was the catalyst for it. Good things will come from this relationship.What an uplifting, happy movie for everyone: the new couple, Harry, who now must learn the art of patience while he awaits re-acquisition of his holdings one property per year, and the viewer, privy to their story and two fantastic kisses!",5,The beauty of brains,1199059200,"12 31, 2007",2007,1900,"['What', 'movie', 'together', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'deliberate', 'thoughtful', 'actress', 'Add', 'handsome', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'teacher/reporter', 'John', 'Goodman', 'hard-boiled', 'nonsense', 'businessman', 'have', 'winner.This', 'movie', 'study', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'self-respect', 'respect', 'others', 'integrity', 'dignity', 'beauty', 'brains', 'When', 'Billie', 'Melanie', 'Paul', 'Don', 'can', 'get', 'anything', 'Harry', 'John', 'lack', 'understanding', 'self-worth', 'mink', 'coat', 'what', 'movie', 'end', 'more', 'earned', 'self-respect', 'determination', 'get', 'it.The', 'whole', 'education', 'aspect', 'smarten', 'up', 'Billie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'embarrassment', 'Harry', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'wonderful', 'example', 'viewers', 'power', 'knowledge', 'Harry', 'Paul', 'who', 'Billie', 'off', 'educational', 'journey', 'jump', 'unused', 'brain', 'First', 'book', 'one', 'actually', 'Alexis', 'Toqueville', 'vocabulary', 'culture', 'art', 'National', 'Gallery', 'Art', 'especially', 'focusing', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'painting', 'dignity', 'manual', 'labor', 'reminder', 'father.Billie', 'questions', 'later', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'new', 'profound', 'awareness', 'status', 'quo', 'easy', 'maintain', 'change', 'always', 'difficult', 'case', 'change', 'come', 'new', 'self-respect', 'self-confidence', 'new', 'Billie', 'will', 'marry', 'Paul', 'trading', 'one', 'man', 'misleading', 'particular', 'man', 'growth', 'fact', 'was', 'catalyst', 'Good', 'things', 'will', 'come', 'uplifting', 'happy', 'movie', 'everyone', 'new', 'couple', 'Harry', 'who', 'now', 'must', 'learn', 'art', 'patience', 're-acquisition', 'holdings', 'one', 'property', 'year', 'viewer', 'privy', 'story', 'two', 'fantastic', 'kisses']",N/A

I have always enjoyed movies with Melanie Griffith, if you liked the movie ""Milk Money"", you will like this show.The movie is a great romantic comedy that says a lot about how a little knowledge can go a long way.  Maybe if more people saw it, they could see the value of an education a little more.  Also how a teacher can make learning something fun, almost like a game.  One of my favorite parts of the entire movie is the scene where she is at a dinner party and the conversation turns to politics and something regarding the Amendments to the Constitution.  Billie (Melanie) corrects the person and tells them that the amendment was a different number than the one they said.  Then her explaination of how she remembers the amendments to the tune of ""The 12 Days of Christmas"" is great.  She is using one of the great tools of learning something that you need to remember.  Teachers could make learning more fun using these kinds of tricks.Movies like this can give education a better name and make it seem more worthwhile, it can change a person's view of themselves, especially women, to help them develop confidence, self respect, and the realization of their self worth and help them see that it could be part of the answer to helping them get out of abusive relationships.Loved the rest of the cast...John Goodman plays the part of the abusive, domineering male with gusto and of course Don Johnson is a perfect contrast to Goodman.
