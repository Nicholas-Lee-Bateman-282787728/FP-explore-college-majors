These two movies highlight all of this and more. He must have been very self-assured. No camera tricks or leading ladies standing in trenches to make him seem taller.  It was never questioned by movie-goers why the statuesque leading ladies would choose him over the tall handsome hunks.  Who could resist his wit and debonair charm.  Gone too soon; but living on in celluloid memories. Kudos to Liza Minnelli!
