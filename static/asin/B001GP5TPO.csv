1198515,AY12DBB0U420B,B001GP5TPO,Gary Peterson,"[1, 1]","This one took me by surprise. I'd never heard of it before. I guess it appeared on my recommendations list because I had showed interest in the Blue Man Group videos and had reviewed two of them. In  any case, ""Stomp Live"" seemed worth a try. I didn't know what to expect. In the first act, a percussion/dance ensemble did a number using push brooms as their musical instruments. A smile crossed my face. It was delightful and very well done! And that was a key to the  entire remainder of the ""Stomp Live"" DVD.The Stomp troupe consisted of eight members, 6 men and 2 women. It's a strange looking group, almost as if they just don't belong together, but they're astonishingly well coordinated. One member served as the troupe ""clown"" and provided a few breaks in the action and a few chuckles. I'd regard them as a percussion ensemble, but they also preform a few intricate dances as a part of the percussion. They ""play"" anything they can get their hands (or feet) on. Push broom, hubcaps. Zippo lighters, open newspapers, waste baskets, garbage cans, chairs, mops, plastic bags, plastic buckets, kitchen utensils, you name it. I just can't remember them all. There must be twice as many things as I have listed. The only objects that resemble conventional musical instrument  are a few strange drums and a variety of drumsticks. All of their numbers are very engaging. There's no boredom here! The troupe comes out, goes through a routine, and then drifts into a new routine. One act after another with little break in between. The variety of acts is amazing, all carried out with precision, and all are percussion, sometimes with dancing. No other musical instruments and no singing are employed.This is an impressive video. I'm amazed. The Stomp Live video put a smile on my face for the entire duration of playing. I'll view it many more times, and I can hardly wait to play it for friends. It's a video that anyone can enjoy, no matter what your musical preferences might be.Gary Peterson",5,Stomp Live Put A Smile On My Face!,1329264000,"02 15, 2012",2012,1995,"['one', 'took', 'surprise', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'guess', 'appeared', 'recommendations', 'list', 'had', 'showed', 'interest', 'Blue', 'Man', 'Group', 'videos', 'had', 'reviewed', 'two', 'case', 'Stomp', 'Live', 'seemed', 'try', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'first', 'act', 'percussion/dance', 'ensemble', 'did', 'number', 'using', 'push', 'brooms', 'musical', 'instruments', 'smile', 'crossed', 'face', 'was', 'delightful', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'key', 'entire', 'remainder', 'Stomp', 'Live', 'DVD.The', 'Stomp', 'troupe', 'consisted', 'eight', 'members', '6', 'men', '2', 'women', 'strange', 'looking', 'group', 'almost', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong', 'together', ""'re"", 'astonishingly', 'well', 'coordinated', 'One', 'member', 'served', 'troupe', 'clown', 'provided', 'few', 'breaks', 'action', 'few', 'chuckles', ""'d"", 'regard', 'percussion', 'ensemble', 'also', 'preform', 'few', 'intricate', 'dances', 'part', 'percussion', 'play', 'anything', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'feet', 'Push', 'broom', 'hubcaps', 'Zippo', 'lighters', 'open', 'newspapers', 'waste', 'baskets', 'garbage', 'cans', 'chairs', 'mops', 'plastic', 'bags', 'plastic', 'buckets', 'kitchen', 'utensils', 'name', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'must', 'be', 'twice', 'as', 'many', 'things', 'have', 'listed', 'only', 'resemble', 'conventional', 'musical', 'instrument', 'are', 'few', 'strange', 'drums', 'variety', 'drumsticks', 'numbers', 'are', 'very', 'engaging', 'boredom', 'here', 'troupe', 'out', 'routine', 'then', 'drifts', 'new', 'routine', 'One', 'act', 'little', 'break', 'variety', 'acts', 'amazing', 'carried', 'out', 'precision', 'are', 'percussion', 'sometimes', 'dancing', 'other', 'musical', 'instruments', 'singing', 'are', 'employed.This', 'impressive', 'video', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'Stomp', 'Live', 'video', 'put', 'smile', 'face', 'entire', 'duration', 'playing', ""'ll"", 'view', 'many', 'more', 'times', 'can', 'hardly', 'wait', 'play', 'friends', 'video', 'anyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'matter', 'what', 'musical', 'preferences', 'might', 'be.Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A

1198518,A1P2NBM3P3TS2X,B001GP5TPO,"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[32, 32]","It is rare for stage shows to get a video release.  You can count the DVD releases of still-active Broadway shows on one hand and have a few fingers left over.  STOMP, thank goodness, is tossing that rule into one of their oft-used and abused trash bins.This DVD features a full performance of the wonderfully entertaining stage show, filmed in the UK on the same stage where many of the show's segments were created.Even after a decade and a half, STOMP still defies easy description.  Part concert, part theatre....  Impossible to pigeonhole.  But it is 100% entertaining and fun.  In STOMP, the world is your drum kit.I've attended ten performances of this show since 1995 and I never grow tired of it.  This DVD is a perfect souvenir of the performance.There are quite a few bonus features on the disc, including a peek at some new bits being developed for future versions of the show.  You also get performer bios, interviews with STOMP creators and directors, an alternate take of one show segment, and a few other bells and whistles.A few years back saw the release of ""STOMP Out Loud"" on home video.  It featured bits from the stage show and new material created especially for the pay-cable program, but it wasn't the complete show.  Not even close.  I liked ""STOMP Out Loud"", but I was a little disappointed that I wasn't getting the full stage show.But now it's here!!I cannot recommend this DVD enough.  Fun, fun show.  Even my fuddy-duddy friends who don't like theatre love this show.Great disc, good crisp picture and sound.I've only had it 24 hours and I've already watched it twice.My personal favorite segment is ""Hands and Feet"", perhaps the most rhythmically complex and interesting part of the show.  It is carefully structured and choreographed but also allows room for quite a bit of improvisation, like a jazz routine.In a perfect world, someone would figure out how to mesh the magic of STOMP with the zany and creative juggling of The Flying Karamazov Brothers......",5,Finally (and unbelievably) on DVD!
