856735,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00062IENC,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[16, 17]","Creativity and excellence flow in abundance in this marvelous stage play filmed live in Los Angeles, with an exuberant, brilliant cast. Written, directed and produced by David E. Talbert, as part of the Soul Theater Series, ""The Fabric of a Man"" is a romantic comedy with a sparkling, often hilarious script, and lots of music. It has God at its core, the choices we make in life as its theme, and a dash of sauciness, a combination that is a delight, as well as having an honesty that is quite true to life. The plot revolves around Dominique, a strong woman who believes in her own talent and has a passion for her work, and her dilemma in choosing 1 out of the 2 men in her life. Her beau, Blair, a self-centered but successful stock broker, who wants her to put her career on the back burner, and a handsome young man with a good heart and lots of potential. They make her examine what is truly important in life, and discern truth from appearances.The fabulous cast:Tammy Townsend is gorgeous and wonderful as Dominique. Known for her work on television, this is Tammy's debut as a stage actress, and she is impressive.Darrin Dewitt Hensen is Joshua, the young man who works in a dry cleaning store. Darrin is terrific, and is a sculpted, incredible specimen of the human race.Clifton Powers is Blair, Dominique's beau. Clifton's comedic timing and polished performance is a marvel.Orlando Wright is Orlando, Dominique's gay assistant, and he is priceless.Buddy Lewis is Ray, Joshua's boss, who loves the color orange. It's a quirky, very funny part, and Buddy plays it to the max.Kitra Williams is Ernestine, the big woman with an even bigger heart. Her 2nd scene with Ray is a gem!Cedric Ford is Reverend Majors, Dominique's father, who is a lovable, big bear of a guy.Leslie ""Big Lez"" Segar has a laugh-out-loud scene in the 1st few minutes of the play, and also did some of the choreography.Robbie Lewis wrote the score, with songs by Brent Jones, and the ingenious set design, representing the Fulton Avenue area of Brooklyn, is remarkable. DVD extras include a ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette, where one can see how the famous shower scene was done, and film commentary by David Talbert, who deserves the highest praise for this superb production. Total running time is 150 minutes.",5,A Joy and Delight,1133136000,"11 28, 2005",2005,2292,"['Creativity', 'excellence', 'flow', 'abundance', 'marvelous', 'stage', 'play', 'filmed', 'live', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'exuberant', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'Written', 'directed', 'produced', 'David', 'E.', 'Talbert', 'part', 'Soul', 'Theater', 'Series', 'Fabric', 'Man', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'sparkling', 'often', 'hilarious', 'script', 'lots', 'music', 'God', 'core', 'choices', 'make', 'life', 'theme', 'dash', 'sauciness', 'combination', 'delight', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'honesty', 'quite', 'true', 'life', 'plot', 'Dominique', 'strong', 'woman', 'who', 'own', 'talent', 'passion', 'work', 'dilemma', 'choosing', '1', '2', 'men', 'life', 'beau', 'Blair', 'self-centered', 'successful', 'stock', 'broker', 'who', 'put', 'career', 'back', 'burner', 'handsome', 'young', 'man', 'good', 'heart', 'lots', 'potential', 'make', 'examine', 'what', 'truly', 'important', 'life', 'discern', 'truth', 'appearances.The', 'fabulous', 'cast', 'Tammy', 'Townsend', 'gorgeous', 'wonderful', 'Dominique', 'Known', 'work', 'television', 'Tammy', 'debut', 'stage', 'actress', 'impressive.Darrin', 'Dewitt', 'Hensen', 'Joshua', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'dry', 'cleaning', 'store', 'Darrin', 'terrific', 'sculpted', 'incredible', 'specimen', 'human', 'race.Clifton', 'Powers', 'Blair', 'Dominique', 'beau', 'Clifton', 'comedic', 'timing', 'polished', 'performance', 'marvel.Orlando', 'Wright', 'Orlando', 'Dominique', 'gay', 'assistant', 'priceless.Buddy', 'Lewis', 'Ray', 'Joshua', 'boss', 'who', 'color', 'orange', 'quirky', 'very', 'funny', 'part', 'Buddy', 'max.Kitra', 'Williams', 'Ernestine', 'big', 'woman', 'even', 'bigger', 'heart', '2nd', 'scene', 'Ray', 'gem', 'Cedric', 'Ford', 'Reverend', 'Majors', 'Dominique', 'father', 'who', 'lovable', 'big', 'bear', 'guy.Leslie', 'Big', 'Lez', 'Segar', 'laugh-out-loud', 'scene', '1st', 'few', 'minutes', 'play', 'also', 'did', 'choreography.Robbie', 'Lewis', 'wrote', 'score', 'songs', 'Brent', 'Jones', 'ingenious', 'set', 'design', 'representing', 'Fulton', 'Avenue', 'area', 'Brooklyn', 'remarkable', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'Scenes', 'featurette', 'where', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'famous', 'shower', 'scene', 'was', 'done', 'film', 'commentary', 'David', 'Talbert', 'who', 'highest', 'praise', 'superb', 'production', 'Total', 'running', 'time', '150', 'minutes']",David E.

This is something every man and woman should pay attention to.  Dominque is forced to choose between financial substance and spirtual and emotional substance; she initially makes the wrong choice only to discover that the man she has may not be the man she needs.
