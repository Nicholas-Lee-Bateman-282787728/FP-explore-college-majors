1214897,A23JNLBAE18XO0,B001LM64VK,Frank R. Schoonover,"[6, 6]","The Beverly Hillbillies Official Third Season DVD is yet another wonderful offering by Paramount and it's sister company CBS DVD. It has all thirty four episodes of this third season of this funny and terrific show that ran on the CBS TV network from 1962-1971. It also features a documentary called The Legend of the Beverly Hillbillies that was released onto home video originally distributed by CBS Fox Home Video, who originally held the video rights to the TV show, as they released select choice episodes onto VHS until CBS and Viacom alongside Paramount took over the video rights from them.Likewise with Official Second Season, we are treated with the entire third season. The episodes are digitally remastered from original negatives for superb and superior quality. The original theme song, The Ballad of Jed Clampett, is also included with all the episodes and we also have the original sponsorships and cast commercials that were originally with the series during the episodes initial network run. Likewise, you do have the option of watching the episodes with or without the sponsorships and cast commercials, but I prefer to watch the episodes with both the sponsorships and cast commercials for nostalgic and historical purposes as these spots are definitely a part of history.Likewise, Paramount and it's sister company CBS DVD do another wonderful job here on these episodes. The digital remastering makes the episodes of this wonderful show look fresh, clean and new as the day that they were originally shown on the CBS TV network. They also again make mincemeat of all those public domain DVD sets that were released as the DVD boom was taking off.Likewise, this is another one of the best sets of this classic TV show that has been released on DVD with Official Second Season, MPI's Ultimate Collections Volumes 1 & 2 and it's companion MPI's Beverly Hillbillies/Petticoat Junction Christmas Collection alongside this.If anyone from Paramount and it's sister company CBS DVD is reading this, why not release the entire Beverly Hillbillies series on DVD? That way, we fans and admirers of this series can really be overjoyed. This is only a suggestion, but again, I still think that the entire series should be released officially on DVD. That would be ""IT"".Overall, this is another one of the finest collections of The Beverly Hillbillies that nobody who loves this show should be without.

Personally, I don't like them, but the great thing is that you have the choice of playing the episodes with or without the advertising. Some of the difference may be that as Americans, the other reviewers remember the shows that way, with some nostalgia. For me, living in a country where cigarette advertising on television has never been legal, my fond memories are of the version without the ads.This is a great set of my favourite season of a fantastic show, complete with all the original music , photo gallery and an excellent special feature, ""The Legend of the Beverly Hillbillies"". Every episode is packed with laughs; the Hillbillies are still as funny and as wonderful as I remember them from my childhood.Contents are:Disc 1Jed Becomes a Movie MogulClampett CityClampett City General StoreHedda Hopper's HollywoodDr. Jed ClampettBack to MarinelandJed, the HeartbreakerDisc 2Teenage IdolThe Widow Poke ArrivesThe BalletThe BoarderThe Boarder StaysStart the New Year RightClampett General HospitalDisc 3The Movie StarletElly in the MoviesDash Riprock, You CadClampett A-Go-GoGranny's RomanceJed's TemptationDouble-Nought JethroDisc 4Clampett's MillionsDrysdale's Dog DaysBrewster's HoneymoonFlatt, Clampett and ScruggsJed and the CountessBig Daddy, JedCool School is OutDisc 5The Big Bank BattleThe Clampetts vs. AutomationThe Brewsters ReturnLuke's BoyJed, the BachelorThe Art CenterThe Legend of the Beverly HillbillesPhoto Gallery",5,At last!
