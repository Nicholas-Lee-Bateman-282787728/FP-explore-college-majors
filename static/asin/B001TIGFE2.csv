1236439,A2V9DTXTQ5YIMK,B001TIGFE2,"A. Hudson ""bisou bisou""","[0, 0]","When I saw the preview for this movie I was excited. I am a big fan of ""Big Brother"" on network TV. I consider myself to be a `people watcher' if I am at the airport and such. I think it is fun to observe people but this movie is geared to the voyeur, which I am not.I think the idea of this `movie' is excellent but it was not well executed. One thing to note it is a drama movie not actually surveillance videos. It is shot in the sense of portraying it through the eye of a surveillance camera but with actors and scripts. The movie is about different people who either come together in the film at certain points or never cross paths. Again a good idea but I think the `story' could have been better. A few subjects it touches on is cop killers, pedophiles, gas station worker, young teenage students, teachers, an insurance man, an oversexed retail worker, a middle eastern college student, etc.The movie just could not hold my attention (or interest). It is again about filming through the eyes of surveillance camera. The film might have fake time stamps but the sounds of the `characters' are the only ones being picked up (true surveillance you would not hear them as well).  The portrayed surveillance film is of good quality, which we know not all are and usually are very grainy. However it failed to grab me since it was just not `real' to me. Even if it was actually footage I would not enjoy watching it nor believe it. One cop scene takes place on a busy road with cars traveling up and down. People would have heard what happened in the scene or saw it.  There are a lot of sexual tones that I thought the movie could have done without. Without spoiling it one character is always having sex with different women and they portray that. Once or twice OK but after that come on. You have two business men, one who is married, who have an affair and it is supposedly `caught' in a public place. Anyone who enjoys and is not bothered by the pedophile is sick on my opinion. Even though I knew it was fake it still bothered me to watch. You have oversexed teenagers and teachers who want to bang each other. Not their words but I cannot write what they say to each other. The only thing I can say that if it was a true surveillance camera I was happy when one student was `caught' after she lied about what a teacher did to her. I also did not appreciate that the Middle Eastern man is labeled a `terrorist' by leaving an item somewhere just because of his culture and not his actions.The music had a lot to be desired and some parts was just ominous sound clips that started low and went so high I had to adjust the volume each time. It was piercing and hurt your ears.Again I think it was an excellent idea for a movie but not well done. I think different characters and stories would have worked. None of it was shocking but just sick as in crude if you ask me.  All I could think watching it if I was in the position of one of the characters in the movie and doing things in public places (elevators, work, malls, etc.) I would expect there to be cameras and don't think your privacy is being invaded. I sadly would not recommend this movie but gave it two stars for the originality of a film but it lacked everything else.",2,Excellent idea but poorly executed,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,3239,"['When', 'saw', 'preview', 'movie', 'was', 'excited', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Big', 'Brother', 'network', 'TV', 'consider', 'be', 'people', 'watcher', 'am', 'airport', 'such', 'think', 'fun', 'observe', 'people', 'movie', 'geared', 'voyeur', 'am', 'not.I', 'think', 'idea', 'movie', 'excellent', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'executed', 'One', 'thing', 'note', 'drama', 'movie', 'not', 'actually', 'surveillance', 'videos', 'shot', 'sense', 'portraying', 'eye', 'surveillance', 'camera', 'actors', 'scripts', 'movie', 'different', 'people', 'who', 'come', 'together', 'film', 'certain', 'points', 'never', 'cross', 'paths', 'Again', 'good', 'idea', 'think', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'few', 'subjects', 'cop', 'killers', 'pedophiles', 'gas', 'station', 'worker', 'young', 'teenage', 'students', 'teachers', 'insurance', 'man', 'oversexed', 'retail', 'worker', 'middle', 'eastern', 'college', 'student', 'etc.The', 'movie', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'hold', 'attention', 'interest', 'again', 'filming', 'eyes', 'surveillance', 'camera', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'fake', 'time', 'stamps', 'sounds', 'characters', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'being', 'picked', 'up', 'true', 'surveillance', 'would', 'not', 'hear', 'as', 'well', 'portrayed', 'surveillance', 'film', 'good', 'quality', 'know', 'not', 'are', 'usually', 'are', 'very', 'grainy', 'However', 'failed', 'grab', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'real', 'Even', 'was', 'actually', 'footage', 'would', 'not', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'believe', 'One', 'cop', 'scene', 'place', 'busy', 'road', 'cars', 'traveling', 'up', 'down', 'People', 'would', 'have', 'heard', 'what', 'happened', 'scene', 'saw', 'are', 'lot', 'sexual', 'tones', 'thought', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'spoiling', 'one', 'character', 'always', 'having', 'sex', 'different', 'women', 'portray', 'Once', 'twice', 'OK', 'come', 'have', 'two', 'business', 'men', 'one', 'who', 'married', 'who', 'have', 'affair', 'supposedly', 'caught', 'public', 'place', 'Anyone', 'who', 'not', 'bothered', 'pedophile', 'sick', 'opinion', 'Even', 'knew', 'was', 'fake', 'still', 'bothered', 'watch', 'have', 'oversexed', 'teenagers', 'teachers', 'who', 'want', 'bang', 'other', 'Not', 'words', 'can', 'not', 'write', 'what', 'say', 'other', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'true', 'surveillance', 'camera', 'was', 'happy', 'when', 'one', 'student', 'was', 'caught', 'lied', 'what', 'teacher', 'did', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'appreciate', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'man', 'labeled', 'terrorist', 'leaving', 'item', 'somewhere', 'just', 'culture', 'not', 'actions.The', 'music', 'had', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'parts', 'was', 'just', 'ominous', 'sound', 'clips', 'started', 'low', 'went', 'so', 'high', 'had', 'adjust', 'volume', 'time', 'was', 'piercing', 'hurt', 'ears.Again', 'think', 'was', 'excellent', 'idea', 'movie', 'not', 'well', 'done', 'think', 'different', 'characters', 'stories', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'None', 'was', 'shocking', 'just', 'sick', 'crude', 'ask', 'could', 'think', 'watching', 'was', 'position', 'one', 'characters', 'movie', 'doing', 'things', 'public', 'places', 'elevators', 'work', 'malls', 'etc', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'cameras', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'privacy', 'being', 'invaded', 'sadly', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'gave', 'two', 'stars', 'originality', 'film', 'lacked', 'everything', 'else']",LOOK
1236440,A319Y83RT0MRVR,B001TIGFE2,AIROLF,"[3, 4]","LOOK is my first Amazon Vine DVD and I was delighted to receive it, having read all about this film and watched the trailer on Amazon's Daily Blog about a month ago.The concept of the film is its best feature; the movie is filmed entirely with surveillance cameras. In fact, better than the movie is the outtakes in the special features that show the director as he scouts the perfect positions for stationary elevator and drive thru cameras.There are other special features on this DVD but none are promising. Particularly disappointing is the ""alternative and deleted scenes"" section. The ""alternative scenes"" are really extended scenes and only one or two scenes are actually worth viewing. Cutting these scenes was the right decision, but some of them shouldn't have been filmed at all as they hardly add anything to the story.There plot of the movie is simple and complex at the same time - show people in the glimpses of different cameras as they go about their daily lives. What results is surprising and shocking at the same time - almost 100% of our lives and stories can be seen if one follows all the cameras that are watching us - from the mall cameras in the fitting room to the bathroom cameras to the garage to the cellphone cameras of strangers to the nanny cameras installed by us to spy on others but which, in fact, monitor us as well.The characters in the story all have tangential lines and some have interactivity among themselves. sometimes this results into a story that's a bit too neat, but often it just underscores the interactivity of our lives.Whereas Watchmen asked ""Who is watching the watchmen?"", LOOK asks who is watching YOU? Or me? or all of us? Where does the information from the cameras go? How can it be used? What is it being used for? And can we honestly trace our whole lives through the cameras that surround us? In our overstimulated society, who is reviewing the multiple camera feeds? The implications are great and terrifying.Look illustrates that reviewing the feeds from the cameras all around would yield the stories of our lives (even if some details would be missing - one storyline is left open-ended on purpose).In the end, the movie is more satisfying as a way to trigger contemplation and discussion of issues of privacy and the state of being human in today's technological worldBig Brother might not be watching you, but whoever is watching all the cameras can gather everything they'd like about you at any given time. LOOK is worth a look, is only once, to make you aware of our society's voyeuristic tendencies.",4,great concept and thought-provoking movie (even if the execution is less than stellar),1243468800,"05 28, 2009",2009,2573,"['LOOK', 'first', 'Amazon', 'Vine', 'DVD', 'was', 'delighted', 'receive', 'having', 'read', 'film', 'watched', 'trailer', 'Amazon', 'Daily', 'Blog', 'month', 'ago.The', 'concept', 'film', 'best', 'feature', 'movie', 'filmed', 'entirely', 'surveillance', 'cameras', 'fact', 'better', 'movie', 'outtakes', 'special', 'features', 'show', 'director', 'perfect', 'positions', 'stationary', 'elevator', 'drive', 'thru', 'are', 'other', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'none', 'are', 'promising', 'Particularly', 'disappointing', 'alternative', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'section', 'alternative', 'scenes', 'are', 'really', 'extended', 'scenes', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'are', 'actually', 'worth', 'viewing', 'Cutting', 'scenes', 'was', 'right', 'decision', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'hardly', 'add', 'anything', 'story.There', 'plot', 'movie', 'simple', 'complex', 'same', 'time', 'show', 'people', 'glimpses', 'different', 'cameras', 'go', 'daily', 'lives', 'What', 'results', 'surprising', 'shocking', 'same', 'time', 'almost', '100', '%', 'lives', 'stories', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'one', 'cameras', 'are', 'watching', 'mall', 'cameras', 'fitting', 'room', 'bathroom', 'cameras', 'garage', 'cellphone', 'cameras', 'strangers', 'nanny', 'cameras', 'installed', 'spy', 'others', 'fact', 'monitor', 'well.The', 'characters', 'story', 'have', 'tangential', 'lines', 'have', 'interactivity', 'sometimes', 'results', 'story', 'bit', 'too', 'neat', 'often', 'just', 'interactivity', 'lives.Whereas', 'Watchmen', 'asked', 'Who', 'watching', 'watchmen', 'LOOK', 'who', 'watching', 'YOU', 'Where', 'information', 'cameras', 'go', 'How', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'What', 'being', 'used', 'can', 'honestly', 'trace', 'whole', 'lives', 'cameras', 'surround', 'overstimulated', 'society', 'who', 'reviewing', 'multiple', 'camera', 'feeds', 'implications', 'are', 'great', 'terrifying.Look', 'reviewing', 'feeds', 'cameras', 'around', 'would', 'yield', 'stories', 'lives', 'even', 'details', 'would', 'be', 'missing', 'one', 'storyline', 'left', 'open-ended', 'purpose', 'end', 'movie', 'more', 'satisfying', 'way', 'trigger', 'contemplation', 'discussion', 'issues', 'privacy', 'state', 'being', 'human', 'today', 'technological', 'worldBig', 'Brother', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'watching', 'whoever', 'watching', 'cameras', 'can', 'gather', 'everything', ""'d"", 'like', 'given', 'time', 'LOOK', 'look', 'only', 'once', 'make', 'aware', 'society', 'voyeuristic', 'tendencies']",LOOK

1236442,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001TIGFE2,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","You probably know what Look is about by now- surveillance cameras that capture numerous people in a variety of situations (such as a creepy man frequently having sex in a shopping mall storage room and being involved in sexual harassment cases with a bunch of different women, teenagers dealing with criminals who enter their mini mart late at night with a deep dark secret unbeknownst to the teens, an underage girl attempting to seduce her much older teacher in a high school parking lot, and a nerdy man who gets picked on inside his work office and eventually finds himself involved in something MUCH more surprisingly bigger).With that said, my initial feeling was definitely utter disappointment.  Why?  Because at first I believed I had fallen for a gimmick (actually I take that back- I watched through the entire thing so I DID fall for a gimmick) concerning surveillance cameras positioned too perfectly, a picture quality too clear, and the volume up too loud to be ACTUAL surveillance cameras.  Nice trick by the movie writers to make me a sucker and believe they were real surveillance cameras because it worked!However, the fact the movie actually went somewhere (and specifically, went something *good* with a variety of mini stories unraveling piece by piece every few minutes) is the reason I'm giving Look 5 stars.  If not for that, well, surely the movie would have completely fallen apart.Plus, even though the surveillance cameras weren't real, what felt very VERY real (to me at least) was the actual sex and violence involved.  Nothing was held back- the things these people were doing definitely felt like a highly realistic possibility.

What an awesome idea. Oh but what a bad film, so poorly made.The film opens with these very serious titles, there's some bazillions of hours of security camera footage, every American is filmed at least some incredible number of times a day... And then what does the film cut to? Two girls naked in a changing room. Yes they are both very cute, they have very pretty bodies, and nobody can ever deny that. But come on Adam Rifkin, could he have chosen a more hackneyed, prurient choice? Any belief that this might be some form of documentary or study of security camera video, as the opening titles suggest; went 100% completely out the window. The film follows a number of stories and people that ultimately cross paths and end up with a very neat tidy bow at the end of the film. Sadly, just about every clich&eacute; imaginable is covered in this film.From a technical standpoint, the concept of security camera works for about 5 minutes. Nobody wants to watch an almost two hour movie of grainy, out of focus, fixed position cameras. So Rifkin decided to do away with that concept, and only occasionally reminds us that this is supposed to be surveillance cameras. The film has virtually no rhythm. It tries to create some complication by cutting between story lines. In the end, he spends infinitely too much time in the convenience store, and just about every other set he's chosen. Near the end some cutting between stories gets an interesting pace; otherwise, the whole film just plods along. In fact the salt in the wound, there's several scenes where Rifkin fast forwards the video tape, so we don't have to sit listening to some character natter on about nothing. The worst part of this, in the extended scene bonus features; he plays each of those scenes out - there's 45 minutes of this garbage.The film is rated R, and deserves every bit of that rating. There's no fear in showing Tony having sex with several female employees of the department store; a male shipping clerk masturbating behind his computer; and the two girls trying on clothes. But all the male parts are pixellated. It is pathetic. There's plenty of strong language. Drug use. And violence.The bonus features are just horrible. They are incredibly long and tiresome. There is a reel of extended scenes. Another reel of director deleted scenes (the last one of this series is so worth watching, it is the only funny moment in the film that isn't included in the film). Another reel of 'behind the scenes,' where somebody with an absolutely awful voice talks about the preproduction and production work of this film. It is one of the worst films of this type I've ever seen. If anyone could stand to watch this film over again, there is director commentary.Such a bad film. Every clich&eacute; in the world is shown.

However Look is not a documentary, it is a work of fiction, so if you're willing to suspend disbelief, you, as I did, may find the film interesting and worth watching.  I had already seen Look via Netflix, but did not have time to listen to the commentary.

The multiple plot lines are somewhat conventional and play on predictable fears of false accusation and stranger abduction to create an emotional core.

Many of the characters--Sherri the spoiled and hormonally crazed teenager, Marty the arch-nerd, etc--are utter stereotypes, yet they are well-done (especially with the help of realistic scripts) even as stock characters, and the reasons why they must be so clich&eacute;d become evident as one watches. One of the biggest redeeming virtues is the excellent pacing of the film: It moves quickly but smoothly from one to another set of characters and situations, and there are enough interesting twists to where the audience hardly even has to make an effort to suspend disbelief. Unlike many films that utilize this multiple frame-story technique, each episode of ""Look"" is well-developed and contributes in some meaningful way to the grand whole. Along with the fact that it's simply very fun to watch, perhaps the best things about ""Look"" are the morals to its stories. It clearly shows the pervasive impact of hidden cameras in our society and how they have the power to acquit as well as condemn,even if they don't generally capture voices and details in quite the way that's shown here. Many other important messages can be found, most notably ""No matter how overwhelming the temptation becomes, adults MUST avoid affairs with minor teenagers.""

As several stories develop in parallel, the Director managed to produce a film that feels like a documentary, allowing the viewer to almost always have the impression that he is watching actual video surveillance materials, and making you wonder and reflect on how you could be caught in embarrassing or illegal situations, but hopefully, without the typical boredom of a documentary.As surveillance in western societies takes place everywhere, the film successfully delivers its main message, making the audience aware of the actual lack of privacy we all are exposed to. The film makers claim at the opening of the movie that in average a normal citizen is filmed 200 times a day. This figure seemed exaggerated to me at first, but after watching the movie I was persuaded that this order of magnitude is reasonable after all.  In the positive side, the movie proves how useful so much video surveillance can be when needed.

The only clue that we're not looking through actual surveillance cameras is the quality of sound from the mic-ed actors.

I didn't read up on it before watching it and, to tell you the truth, I wasn't too excited to watch it. The gimmick of making a movie entirely with surveillance cameras didn't seem that intriguing to me. What really surprised me was that five minutes into Look I was hooked.The film opens with a title card explaining that there are 30 million surveillance cameras in the U.S. and that the average American is caught on video 200 times a day.Soon, we're watching two teenage girls trying on clothes in a dressing room. Next, we meet the manager of the store who enjoys seducing all of the female employees. We meet a nerdy young man who is constantly ridiculed at work. A teacher with a pregnant wife, a gas station attendant, a couple of serial killers, and various other characters.The film takes advantage of our voyeuristic tendencies as humans. This is what makes it so instantly fascinating and intriguing. What made the film such a profound viewing experience, for me, was the realism of it. While not always pleasant, the film does show a rarely-glimped side of human nature. This subject matter is not glamorized or watered-down which is most likely why this was never billed as big Hollywood movie.Writer/director Adam Rifkin was clearly not afraid of some risk-taking in telling this story. In this surveillance footage format, you're not given a viewpoint that allows you to explore a character's motives, back-story, etc. All we know about the character's is what the surveillance ""footage"" allows us to see. Some filmmakers would find this to be a near-unbearable challenge, but Rifkin seems to embrace it. With these restraints, I found it impressive that he was able to find a way for us to empathize with these characters. Even more impressive is that once we do empathize with them, Rifkin throws the audience a curveball (even though some of these ""curveballs"" are, admittedly, rather predictable).Look is an entertaining, funny, provocative, startling, and profoundly disturbing movie that defies many typical cinematic conventions. What appears to be a mere cinematic experiment turns out to be a movie that will grab you and not let you go, as well as make you think along the way.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[1, 3]","Whether on the bus, at the convenience store or even in the dressing rooms, ""Look"" works under the premise that cameras are everywhere and just about every move we make is recorded.  Hoping to cash in on voyeurism, the film gives the viewer a ""look"" at the lives of a small group of individuals via numerous security cameras, a nanny cam, police and traffic cameras and at least one cellphone camera.There are a number of plots running through the film, some intertwining with others.  Primary plots include a couple of cop murderers on the run, a teen trying to seduce her teacher and a convenience store employee trying to make it big as a musician (from the counter of the store he works in).  Other stories include a lawyer struggling with family and forbidden love, racial profiling, a sexually driven store manager and a pedophile stalking a young girl.Any of these stories could actually happen.  While a couple of them are played up for humor (especially the store manager and convenience store clerk's tales), most of them are quite disturbing.With that said, however, most of these stories are also boring to watch due to the CCTV gimmick.  Not only is this gimmick compromised by the fact that you can hear everything being said by the characters, CCTV cameras are also notorious for not being well focused.  While I can appreciate what director Adam Rifkin is trying to do here, I just don't feel that it works as a film.The acting is also subpar.  For a film utilizing CCTV to emphasize the reality of the events taking place, many of the characters are terribly overacted.  Spencer Redford's over-the-top performance as a seductive teen is probably the best example of this.Giuseppe Andrews (Cabin Fever) and Hayes MacArthur (The Game Plan) are the most recognizable actors in the film.  They also give two of the best performances.The DVD features commentary, a look at CCTV and numerous deleted scenes and alternate takes.

Indeed, the film earns its ""R"" rating literally within the first minute as the voyuers- er... viewers are first taken to a department store fitting room watching two teenage actresses (who do NOT look at all over 18) stripping off their clothes down to their thongs discussing everything but global warming.  They even discussed bleaching a certain part of their body, and no, I'm not referring to their hair.As if THAT wasn't enough, we next observe a manager in the same department store playing grab-*insert obvious body part name here* with his female employees, whom we later see pursuing carnal relations (in graphic detail) in the stock room.  To top it off, the same manager is shown... um... er... making himself feel good while watching adult films in the same stock room.  I am NOT making this up.So, if the sexual voyeurism doesn't hook you, the dark humor just might.  Between the farting in the elevator, the pranks some office workers put the ""nerd"" though, and the dumb goings-on with the convenient store night clerks, you just might get a laugh or two... especially with the interesting ""shocker"" ending (""It's your birthday!"").Laughs and voyeurism aside, the film does an amazing job at making you almost forget you're watching footage exclusively from surveillance cameras.  It isn't choppy or annoying since some cameras do swivel/rotate, making you feel seasick.  I question how some surveillance videos bring in sound given how localized the sound is, but I'm no security expert.I do question the music, however.  It was... annoying.

One, to get your eyes open and two, to point out that this is a movie that is supposed to be shot from surveillance cameras, and to point out just how much our lives are being observed on a day-to-day basis. I've never been in a dressing room with two teenyboppers like that but I found the dialog to be contrived.From then on we are taken on a voyeuristic journey across the city as we observe scenes that are woven into the overall plot. Some are done better than others.  I found myself forgetting that this was supposed to be a movie made from surveillance clips, however, and it became just a regular movie to me. Most of the scenes captured dialog and also a picture quality that I doubt the average camera would be able to match. The scenes were all carefully set up, as well.

But then I have realized that actors are not professionals and that affected the ""feel"" of the movie.  However, the idea for the film  is great.  There are cameras all around us, recording various moments in our lives more than 200 times a day.  Cameras are in stores, at work, on the streets, public parking lots relentlessly recording all events.  Seemingly unrelated events and people are all connected to each other.To add to all of that, there are cell phones and portable devices that can record events and incidents that can in turn be shared with large groups of people without participant's consent.  Not to mention that many of such events can be taken out of context that can label a person for life.No matter what, this film is a representation that we, the people, are  what we want other people to see and not who we really are.  Only the camera can give objective view of who we truly are.  And all those events put in single context together give a new perspective on what the world is really like and what people are capable of doing to themselves and each other.Quality of the DVD I received was not great.

1236480,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B001TIGFE2,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 6]","Look (Adam Rifkin, 2007)You know, I've now seen a number of movies that have this general structure, and I've been dissatisfied with almost every one of them. While watching Look, I finally figured out why this is; everything's tied up in far too neat a package, which lends movies like this far too constructed an air for their cinema verite aspirations. But I'm getting ahead of myself; let me explain what I'm on about first.Billed as ""the first film shot entirely on surveillance cameras"" (which is, in at least one scene, a false claim), Look chronicles a series of interrelated stories that dovetail and converge again over the course of the movie. There are a number of tangled plot threads, all of which bounce around and involve multiple characters. There's also the fact that every plot description I could give would involve major spoilers, since the film sets up most of the key plot points as surprises, so I can't really go into even the first details of the plots. So I'm stuck just telling you the structure, but the structure is exactly what I was talking about in the first paragraph. Timecode, 11:14, and a number of other films have taken this tack (Pulp Fiction obviously does as well, but the structure here differs in that the people keep bumping into one another in different plot threads, which is basically Pulp Fiction carried to its absurd conclusion and with a lot more needless complexity), and while I know they all have a cadre of fans, including this one, I've never found one where this approach works. Ever notice how they all have a gimmick? With Timecode it was the four screens, with this one it's the surveillance cameras, with 11:14 it was everything having to come together at just that moment, etc., etc. Which is another way the verite feel is undercut. But I digress. No, I actually don't; this is all about trying to take an artificial construct and make it look as if it's a natural progression. It just doesn't work for me. (And in this case, to make matters worse, I'd somehow gotten it into my head that this movie was actually a documentary about surveillance cameras.)That said, if you can take it as an artificial construct and overlook Rifkin's blatant attempts to make it not look like one, it's not a half-bad film in a couple of different ways. The acting in this flick is wildly inconsistent, but in order for that to happen, there have to be a few good actors to balance out the bad. Unfortunately, because of the way the film is shot, there are a number of names missing from my notes, and it's most of them that I want to praise. But I can't say that the stoner whose voice kept reminding me of Robert Downey Jr.'s really impressed me. (Oh, wait. I just did.) And some of the music in this movie was absolutely priceless. No, I'm not talking about ""Electrocuted"", though the awfulness of this song is reason enough to at least rent the movie and watch the first twenty minutes. Go a lot farther in. The scene where George is about to get on the bus with the suspicious guy carrying the backpack? Whatever it is that's playing there, that's real music. That's actually one of the best tracks I've heard in a movie I've seen this year that wasn't directed by Masami Akita. (Most of you will probably watch that scene and say ""what music?"". Yes.)Overall, while I'm not either Ben or Ben from At the Movies, this time I'm going to have to give it a Ben and Ben rating: rent it. There are enough amusing moments, enough decent acting, and enough brilliant (non-)music to make it worth checking out once, but make sure it's something you'll want to watch again before buying. **",2,Tiring effort.,1243814400,"06 1, 2009",2009,3632,"['Look', 'Adam', 'Rifkin', '2007', 'know', ""'ve"", 'now', 'seen', 'number', 'movies', 'have', 'general', 'structure', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dissatisfied', 'almost', 'one', 'watching', 'Look', 'finally', 'figured', 'out', 'why', 'everything', 'tied', 'up', 'far', 'too', 'neat', 'package', 'movies', 'far', 'too', 'constructed', 'air', 'cinema', 'verite', 'aspirations', ""'m"", 'getting', 'ahead', 'let', 'explain', 'what', ""'m"", 'about', 'first.Billed', 'first', 'film', 'shot', 'entirely', 'surveillance', 'cameras', 'least', 'one', 'scene', 'false', 'claim', 'Look', 'series', 'interrelated', 'stories', 'dovetail', 'converge', 'again', 'course', 'movie', 'are', 'number', 'tangled', 'plot', 'threads', 'bounce', 'around', 'involve', 'multiple', 'characters', 'also', 'fact', 'plot', 'description', 'could', 'give', 'would', 'involve', 'major', 'spoilers', 'film', 'up', 'most', 'key', 'plot', 'points', 'surprises', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'even', 'first', 'details', 'plots', ""'m"", 'stuck', 'just', 'telling', 'structure', 'structure', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'talking', 'first', 'paragraph', 'Timecode', '11:14', 'number', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'taken', 'tack', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'obviously', 'as', 'well', 'structure', 'here', 'differs', 'people', 'keep', 'bumping', 'one', 'different', 'plot', 'threads', 'basically', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'carried', 'absurd', 'conclusion', 'lot', 'more', 'needless', 'complexity', 'know', 'have', 'cadre', 'fans', 'including', 'one', ""'ve"", 'never', 'found', 'one', 'where', 'approach', 'Ever', 'how', 'have', 'gimmick', 'Timecode', 'was', 'four', 'screens', 'one', 'surveillance', 'cameras', '11:14', 'was', 'everything', 'having', 'come', 'together', 'just', 'moment', 'etc.', 'etc', 'Which', 'way', 'verite', 'feel', 'undercut', 'digress', 'No', 'actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'trying', 'take', 'artificial', 'construct', 'make', 'look', 'natural', 'progression', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'case', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', ""'d"", 'somehow', 'gotten', 'head', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'documentary', 'surveillance', 'cameras', 'said', 'can', 'take', 'artificial', 'construct', 'overlook', 'Rifkin', 'blatant', 'attempts', 'make', 'not', 'look', 'one', 'not', 'half-bad', 'film', 'couple', 'different', 'ways', 'acting', 'flick', 'wildly', 'inconsistent', 'order', 'happen', 'have', 'be', 'few', 'good', 'actors', 'balance', 'out', 'bad', 'Unfortunately', 'way', 'film', 'shot', 'are', 'number', 'names', 'missing', 'notes', 'most', 'want', 'praise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'stoner', 'voice', 'kept', 'reminding', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'really', 'impressed', 'Oh', 'wait', 'just', 'did', 'music', 'movie', 'was', 'absolutely', 'priceless', 'No', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'Electrocuted', 'awfulness', 'song', 'reason', 'enough', 'least', 'rent', 'movie', 'watch', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'Go', 'lot', 'farther', 'scene', 'where', 'George', 'get', 'bus', 'suspicious', 'guy', 'carrying', 'backpack', 'playing', 'there', 'real', 'music', 'actually', 'one', 'best', 'tracks', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'was', ""n't"", 'directed', 'Masami', 'Akita', 'Most', 'will', 'probably', 'watch', 'scene', 'say', 'what', 'music', 'Yes', 'Overall', ""'m"", 'not', 'either', 'Ben', 'Ben', 'Movies', 'time', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'give', 'Ben', 'Ben', 'rating', 'rent', 'are', 'enough', 'amusing', 'moments', 'enough', 'decent', 'acting', 'enough', 'brilliant', 'non-', 'music', 'make', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'once', 'make', 'sure', 'something', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'buying', '**']",LOOK

The basic premise of a seemingly random group of citizens whose stories gradually intersect is hardly a cinematic novelty. What does make this film unique is its central conceit: it is shot entirely from the point of view of surveillance cameras. One would assume that such an approach would bore and annoy the viewer, but such is the skill of the filmmakers that LOOK draws you right in and actually makes you feel like a voyeur of sorts. The cast does an outstanding job of keeping it (virtually) real. To describe the characters and situations would create too many spoilers, so let it suffice to say that LOOK is sometimes humorous, often rather disturbing and occasionally as chilling as any horror film. Even the title is provocative: LOOK at what people tend to do and say when they believe that no one can see or hear them, and LOOK at the unfortunate consequences that can often result. For that matter, LOOK at yourself as you peer into the behavioural abyss of others and ask yourself why, if you dare. A one-of-a-kind film that demands repeat viewings, LOOK carries this reviewer's high recommendation.The DVD, from horror specialist Anchor Bay, features plenty of outtakes and a better-than-average featurette.

Harrell,"[0, 2]","I knew from the very first scene, when the timestamp for the surveillance tape, the primary thread connecting people and places throughout the entire film, of a filled shopping mall indicated that it was 4am, instead of 4pm, that credibility was not going to be a strong point. When I selected this film to review I was interested in seeing a depiction of just how often we think we are experiencing privacy when we aren't. That was, after all, how the film was described in its promotional materials.  What I saw was a lot of stereotyping and poor execution of the primary character: security cameras. To summarize, using mock footage this film shows a glimpse of a handful of peoples' lives and how they intersect, sometimes unknowingly, from the perspective of their paths crossing on hidden cameras--ATMs, public security, private security, cell phone cams, personal video cameras... The whole plot was setup and driven by various perspectives of surveillance shots leading to climaxes of all the various arcs of the plot. The thing is, of at least six of the arcs, only *one* was driven completely from beginning to end with the hidden camera. All of the others could have been the result of a device already at work in the arc, itself, or by the ensemble cast crossing paths at strategic points... The need for the surveillance became moot in most of the subplots. I really wanted the film to demonstrate how the various situations were influenced (or weren't) by having been filmed. I thought that was the whole point of the film. The film is described as being a thriller that reveals just how often we are being filmed when we think we aren't. It's really just a glimpse of people going through their lives as revealed on videotapes, with no real direction. Its description implies show-and-tell, but there's only ""show. No ""tell"" draws it together. If you want to gauge just how often you are being filmed in public, that scary revelation is well-captured.

1236485,ASY25YMTIC2A9,B001TIGFE2,Steve,"[2, 3]","Based entirely on what are suppose to be clips from surveillance cameras, 'Look' uses an interesting premise to tell a story about how the lives of various different people within a city ultimately cross paths and effect one another. In what would probably be considered an Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu rip-off, 'Look' distinguishes itself from movies like 'Babel' and '21 Grams' by the use of the surveillance camera idea, which works very well and makes the movie not just very original, but very interesting.There are a few scenes, particularly at the very beginning, that seem completely ridiculous and unrealistic... so much so that I was put off by it and nearly ended the movie there, but after getting past the first five or ten minutes, I found the stories got better and engrossing. None of the stories within the movie were difficult to believe, as some scenes would be very familiar to anyone who's kept an eye on news headlines during the last ten or fifteen years, which along with the point of view you get from the film, gives you a very realistic and thought-provoking movie. If it weren't for the couple of bad scenes, particularly at the beginning, I would have given it five stars, however those brief scenes were enough to bring you out of the voyeuristic state you find yourself in while watching the movie.Overall, the movie doesn't try to resolve anything in particular, answer any questions, or provide you with an enlightened mood when the film is over... it's there to give you a short glimpse of the lives of people who could very easily be living in your town right now.

Aside from the legal issue of not being able to record audio here in CA, the boring drama of ten people I care nothing about, the tedious articulation of adulterous affairs, stalkers, pedophiles, killers, gay lovers, pranksters, Clerks wannabes and a few other idiots - I guess you could see a good movie.Tons to dislike about this mess, including massive amounts of misplaced music (since technically this is supposed to be surveillance footage), poor video quality (I know on purpose), the blotting out of actor's faces in the police scenes (uhhh, I thought they were actors), and sad stories ripped from the headlines, etc.I gave it a second star for the supplements as the documentary tells a half-hour tale of how to make an independent film. The director summed up the main fault of the story by saying an ""overlord"" takes all of this footage and puts it together for us to see - oookaaaay, right.

The promise of an Orwellian sort of premise was not delivered though, as no negative ramifications of constant surveillance were ever shown.  Where Orwell showed the horribly negative aspects of surveillance, this movie used it as a tool for nothing more than story telling.The movie definitely showed a pronounced invasion of privacy in the daily lives of the people in the movie, but the filmmaker failed to show any effects of this intrusion.  Well, without ruining the movie, I will say that there was ONE occasion where surveillance was used to demonstrate a crime.  On the whole though, the surveillance footage just showed people messing around on their jobs or going through their normal daily lives.  There wasn't enough of a message conveyed to make the film as effective as it should have been.With this said, I really did enjoy the movie.  The script was effective as a drama, but not as a provocative, anti-surveillance movie.  The filmmakers really should have shown some true invasion of privacy, rather than showing what would be seen as justified surveillance in workplaces.  In fact, the lack of anyone viewing the surveillance videos kept a goodly number of people employed when they should, by all rights, have been fired.Do not watch this movie expecting a documentary or anything that roundly condemns the constant surveillance we are subject to in our daily lives.  This movie does not deliver on that message in my opinion.Bottom line:4/5 (for being entertaining)2.5/5 for not delivering on the premise that constant surveillance is a bad thing, which I feel that it certainly is.4/5 overall (rounded up because I actually liked the movie).",4,"Not what I expected, but still and interesting idea",1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2009,1831,"['movie', 'appeared', 'would', 'be', 'pseudo-documentary', 'affair', 'where', 'filmmakers', 'addressed', 'myriad', 'surveillance', 'devices', 'stationed', 'cities', 'world', 'promise', 'Orwellian', 'sort', 'premise', 'was', 'not', 'delivered', 'though', 'negative', 'ramifications', 'constant', 'surveillance', 'were', 'ever', 'shown', 'Where', 'Orwell', 'showed', 'horribly', 'negative', 'aspects', 'surveillance', 'movie', 'used', 'tool', 'nothing', 'more', 'story', 'telling.The', 'movie', 'definitely', 'showed', 'pronounced', 'invasion', 'privacy', 'daily', 'lives', 'people', 'movie', 'filmmaker', 'failed', 'show', 'effects', 'intrusion', 'Well', 'ruining', 'movie', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'ONE', 'occasion', 'where', 'surveillance', 'was', 'used', 'demonstrate', 'crime', 'whole', 'though', 'surveillance', 'footage', 'just', 'showed', 'people', 'messing', 'around', 'jobs', 'going', 'normal', 'daily', 'lives', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'message', 'conveyed', 'make', 'film', 'as', 'effective', 'should', 'have', 'been.With', 'said', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'script', 'was', 'effective', 'drama', 'not', 'provocative', 'anti-surveillance', 'movie', 'filmmakers', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'shown', 'true', 'invasion', 'privacy', 'rather', 'showing', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'seen', 'justified', 'surveillance', 'workplaces', 'fact', 'lack', 'anyone', 'viewing', 'surveillance', 'videos', 'kept', 'goodly', 'number', 'people', 'employed', 'when', 'should', 'rights', 'have', 'been', 'fired.Do', 'not', 'watch', 'movie', 'expecting', 'documentary', 'anything', 'roundly', 'constant', 'surveillance', 'are', 'subject', 'daily', 'lives', 'movie', 'not', 'deliver', 'message', 'opinion.Bottom', 'line:4/5', 'being', 'entertaining', '2.5/5', 'not', 'delivering', 'premise', 'constant', 'surveillance', 'bad', 'thing', 'feel', 'certainly', 'overall', 'rounded', 'up', 'actually', 'liked', 'movie']",LOOK

Rifkin has thrown together a gimmick and a bucket of narrative cliches so that he can try to work through his angst about none of the pretty girls going to prom with him. He pours all his loathing into one single character -- I forget her name, so let's call her Trampy -- who goes ridiculously out of her way to seduce her balding shlub of a teacher. This is a stupid story to begin with but it takes Rifkin's obvious vendetta to raise (or lower) things to the truly grotesque. See, Trampy not only lusts after Mr. Cueball, she's also casually destructive, vindictive, and steals clothes from the mall after frolicking with her gal pal naked in the dressing room. Why? Because it probably turns Rifkin on. While anyone familiar with teenage girls knows they can be jerks, the pure sociopathy on display here is ludicrous and bespeaks that the director was less interested in crafting a compelling film than he was in pillorying every cheerleader to turn him down.And the rest of the movie?

1236492,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001TIGFE2,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[0, 2]","It has been said that there is always someone watching us. There are an estimated 30 million surveillance cameras in the United States and Americans may have been taken photos or videos of in an estimated 200 times a day. Writer/director Adam Rifkin's ""LOOK"" takes a humorous, darkly foreboding look in the world seen through the lens of security cameras. Sure the events are staged, with its sequences played by different actors--but its concept is undeniably real, REAL enough to get under our skin. You might want to take a look at who's watching the next time you do something stupid.The movie is about a group of people. Some related, some totally indifferent to each other. Their lives intertwine, and situations develop without even them knowing. The proceedings of the film are seen through the lens of ATM security cameras, mall cameras, back stock cameras, office and school cameras. Everyone is being observed through their jobs, in the street, while they're shopping, even at their homes. So what do you have to hide?Off the bat, one may see the film's concept as contrived, too expedient and honestly, it's easy to be annoyed with this style of filmmaking seeing as how this gimmick is one that most audiences would easily grow weary of. I do commend Rifkin's approach on the film, it rips away all distractions and goes straight to the point. The style works in the film's favor; it is a strong commentary on what we see and what we ignore in our everyday lives, and what is quite disquieting is the fact that these cameras were built to give us a sense of security; in a way it does, but it all depends on how soon we pay attention to them--and sometimes it is too late.The characters in ""Look"" are your typical everyday folks. There's Tony, the sex-starved store manager who sleeps with a lot of female employees, there are the teenage jailbaits who look at sexual challenges, people with great careers who look for more, a nerdy guy who always gets picked on by his co-workers, there's the mini-mart clerk, a teacher, a middle eastern man who takes pride on himself, and of course, the two murderers. I admit, at first glance these are typical clich&eacute;d characters but what really got me are the different things they are hiding behind closed doors.Of course, there are some central stories that become the film's focus, such as the teacher named Krebbs (Jamie McShane) married to a pregnant wife (Kimberly Quinn) who gets seduced by a teenage vixen(Spencer Redford), and while their story isn't really original, it sure adds a lot of narrative impact near the end. Tony the manager's story arc is the one that provides humor that serves as the film's balance. His scenes of sexual escapades were very cool to watch, the man is bold and one would wonder as to how this person could get away with so many indiscretions. Yes, the film has a good number of sex scenes and mild nudity. Homosexual affairs are also hinted at.  I also took notice of the recurring subplot of the middle eastern man, which was very conventional as to how it would turn out. But Rifkin manages to stick to his style from the film's beginning to end. The most recognizable face in the film would have to be Guiseppe Andrews, (he played ""party man"" in Eli Roth's ""Cabin Fever"") but his was a very minor role and only serves as a simple device for entertainment.The film is shot in a very simple manner and emulates the workings of a security camera. Director of photography Ron Forsythe keeps the shots very constrained, and limited. There are times when he uses some minimal zoom, and some scenes look sharper than others, but the style pretty much kept grainy, from an angular top view, to emulate realism. There are some rather weird places that this so-called security cams are located (such as the women's fitting room) but all these are explained in the film's commentary.Rifkin's storytelling is admittedly predictable but he finds ways to break the film's smugness, which made it easier for me to connect with the movie and be enthralled by the screenplay. The film is very interesting but some folks would rather find some of the scenes a little too convenient. It's great writing in the part of Rifkin, but I am sure that these people would've hit several cameras without anything happening to them, it would have been nice to see a visibly significant character appear numerous times and nothing exciting or dark happens to them. It is also debatable as exactly what kind of commentary Rifkin is trying to make, is it the lack of privacy or that these cameras are only as useful as when or if people actually examine them. I guess people can do what people want with what they see. I do think a small suspension of disbelief is required, as for a film meant to emulate people's secrets, these security cams are like ""eyes of conscience"". I guess it is just statement about the world we live in, it doesn't really present a strong message about things we can improve on, so I suppose one may wonder as to the whole point of the film. In my opinion, it is just what we should do with what we know, and learn to act on what we see and know when to respect other's privacy.""Look"" is pretty creative but not really that inventive. It has excellent intentions, and I do like films that try to come up with something new. It is a slice of our times, the next time you call someone or do something indiscreet and naughty--you would do well to ponder if anyone's watching. Ever get the feeling that someone's watching? Does it make you feel safer or does it make you feel violated?I always feel like somebody's watching me....Recommended! [4 Stars]Video/Audio: 1.78 ratio anamorphic widescreen.
