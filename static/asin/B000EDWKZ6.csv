971931,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B000EDWKZ6,Ernest Jagger,"[0, 0]","This Chinese horror film, ""The Heirloom,"" which is set in Taiwan, does have its flaws, but I still found the film interesting. I do advise caution though, and suggest you rent it first, but I am glad to have it in my collection. The film opens with a young woman crawling on the floor trying to escape a mansion where an entire family, [aunts, uncles, cousins, etc] have just committed mass suicide. Why? What secrets lay buried in this family? And why has this lone woman survived? One of the things I liked about this film is the creepiness of not only the mansion where the film takes place, but also the way director Leste Chan was able to give a creepy feel to the film when the viewer is given glimpses of the outside of the mansion too!Make no mistake, you will either like this film, or not. If you are looking for a decent haunted house film, I would suggest you take a look at this one. Sure the film has its flaws, but I found the film as a whole to be different, and one with a strange twist to the legacy of this family which caused so much grief to themselves. The beginning of the film gives the viewer the history of Hsiano Guei [raising child ghosts]. The premise here is that it is an old Chinese folk practice in which dead fetuses are worshiped. These fetuses are kept in urns, and in turn these child ghosts, as they are referred to, then give the ancestors tremendous power and fortune. However, this practice of the dark arts also comes with a steep price to pay.The viewer is introduced to James Yang (Jason Cheng) who has just inherited this mansion. He is an architect, and has been living abroad in England for many years. The mass suicide which occurred in the mansion took place over 20 years ago, and no one has occupied it since. This is an old and very big mansion that dates to the era of the Japanese occupation. Moreover, this mansion has seen better days. And although we see the chipped paint, and dusty floors, it is large and spacious: and the dark secrets it holds are about to unleash itself on Mr. Yang and his friends. Apparently, whatever caused the first mass suicide is not completely gone. The mansion has a life of its own--as too much evil has been done here, and the director has a way of making you feel this presence with the camera. The way the camera captures certain places in the mansion give the halls and rooms an eerie feel, and you just sense that a great tragedy has occurred here. And more importantly, that there is an unknown evil waiting, and something in this place is just not right.The film reminded me a lot of the old-fashioned horror films from yesteryear, where you could feel the dread of a haunted house in films, by the way the director did not push in on the viewer [i.e.: a cat jumping out of a cupboard which has been closed for years, or a bird flying out of a room when the door has been opened]. No, in this film, the sense of dread has full weight due to the visuals which the camera-men have employed to the maximum. This was a plus for me. In the films narrative, Yi-Chen (Yu-chen Chang) is a guest at the mansion, along with another friend named Cheng. Both of these occupants keep finding themselves awakening in the mansion after they have gone home. Tragedy is about to strike once again, as the dormant evil of the mansion is awakened. There is more to the film I do not wish to divulge.One of the eerie parts of the film also involves a detective named Wu, who while investigating a case, finds that he too keeps waking up in the mansion. With TV cameras installed in the halls, rooms, and outside of the mansion--he attempts to unlock what is happening by having his officers monitor the building. Like I wrote in the beginning, this is not a film for everyone. This is a different type of horror film. One that I liked quite a bit. It does have its flaws, but I am willing to overlook these due to the fact the film is not only different, but I found it to be very strange, creepy, and eerie. And not many horror films make me feel that way. Also, the cinematography is very good. Recommended with caution. Rent it first.

971932,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B000EDWKZ6,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[2, 2]","THE HEIRLOOMThis Taiwanese horror film is more like the classic gothic atmosphere style films from the early days of horror. If you go into this expecting anything from the latest style of horror, or expect a ghostly kid like that of ""Ju On"" [or ""The Grudge"" for the less educated in this area] then you may be disappointed. For fans of old horror ghost stories this may be the film for you. Be warned that it does move a bit slow but the story is great and the atmosphere of the film is as well.In an old house a family practices some black arts in which they raise the ghosts of children. At one such event things go wrong and the family performs a mass suicide by hanging themselves. 20 years later James [Jason Chang] inherits the house and decides he wants to keep it, even though he is urged to sell it, but he expects to marry his girlfriend and start a life there. She is still unsure about it but agrees along with a couple of friends that they should stay there and check it out. Things start to build and things begin to happen as he finds out what his family was all about. The will also have to face what was left in that house, a child.This is not your typical horror film as far as today goes, like I said it builds and plays out much like the films of old. Think the original ""The Haunting"" and films like that, so if you like that you will like this. The best thing about this film is just that, that old school atmosphere that film creates. The camera work is great here as well especially the shots outside of the house, love em. The acting is good here as well Jason Chang did a good job here as did Terri Kwan playing his girl. I have heard some people disliked this film because of the acting but I thought it was pretty good.Dorian Li did a good job with script on this one as did director Leste Chen in creating the ghostly atmosphere. Now there are also some flaws to be seen here such as the pacing and motion of the film. The movie does indeed move kinda slow especially in the beginning but the story and ending make up for it. I do recommend this film to any horror fan out there especially fans of the older classic ghost tales.

971933,A2SRP2HP75CUVD,B000EDWKZ6,Horror-Fanatics.com,"[8, 8]","Some may think that supernatural stories are played out. We've had plenty here in the states and we're getting much more overseas. What I love about each of these movies is that they're not so repetitive. You get tired of seeing the same thing over and over again, but with these kind of thrillers we always get something different. Sure the ghosts are there but the stories are different and the way the characters are presented is what makes each film stand alone. There are some many movies that I can name which carry the same overall topic but each of those movies you see in the stores are different from each other in one way or another. You don't have to watch these movies for the scares even though it's fun to be scared. You can just sit down and watch it for the story and the relationships between the characters. Heirloom to me is one of those movies. Sure it's a movie about an unknown supernatural force but it's the films story that draws you in. Heirloom isn't really scary and I don't believe it was made to be a scary movie. What makes Heirloom so great and powerful is the plot and the twists that you figure out as you go along.Heirloom tells the story of a man who inherits an old family house. As he checks the place out he decides to move in and bring his fianc?e along. As they stay in the house the man slowly begins to remember parts from his childhood, bringing back old memories that were forgotten with age. The house has a dark history, in which thirty years prior the entire family attended bizarre rituals an ended up committing suicide all at the same time. Each relative hung on a rope to die. While the man is unaware of his family's history he begins to witness some strange happenings involving the old house. Friends are appearing in the house out of nowhere and others are being killed off from weird and mysterious causes. Is it the house itself or is there something evil going on? We soon find out as the couple dig deeper into the family history and what really went on thirty years ago.Now this is a movie definitely worth watching. The story is great even though not all of it is original. But the way it's played out scene by scene is different and when you figure out the mystery behind everything it's not pleasant at all. Heirloom features one of the most disturbing plot turns I've ever seen. It's not graphic but the idea of everything is so twisted and wrong that the story just completely drives you in. Heirloom is a very dramatic horror film with a heart pounding mystery, likeable characters and a good story all around. The plot and dialog in the movie is what really makes it good to watch. It's been so long since I've been bothered by a twist and Heirloom does a really good job of letting the story unfold with the dialog and disturbing flashbacks. Most of the movie we fallow a couple who try to find out the mystery behind the house and all the weird events that have taken place over the last week. The overall subject deals with family curses, punishments and characters who have to deal with the same fate.The movie is beautifully shot, using different views from inside the house to give it a more creepy feeling that the house itself is large and contains a dark history. A lot of scenes blend together with flash backs to tell the story and give it more of a questionable approach as to what the answer to everything is. Like most mysterious you don't get to know everything until near the end. Which is also when we get to see more of these flashbacks, the near end explains it all. The overall look of Heirloom is also really good. The art design is fantastic and you really believe that the characters are staying in an old house. Nothing looks too fake or obvious. The locations are fine and to spice things up the film also has a simple yet perfectly fitting score. The music sets up the mood and each scene should be enough to draw your attention. Heirloom is a well made and good looking film which I really recommend watching. Also be sure to check out the bonus features to understand more about the making of it.If you want to see a movie that will scare the living daylights out of you, then look somewhere else. Heirloom isn't the kind of movie to watch for scares, or blood and guts for that matter. Like many movies involving supernatural mysteries Heirloom is a plot and dialog driven film. Using the story and characters to set the mood and to have you guessing until the end. But trust me when I say it's not pleasant. There are no happy endings or events in this picture. The story is very dark and can be unsettling at times. Watch Heirloom for the mystery, not for action or a huge body count. If you sit down and pay attention all the way through then you will be rewarded. It's a good movie that doesn't supply scares and blood to get the viewers attention. There's plenty of drama and mystery for that.",4,A very dramatic horror film with a heart pounding mystery,1146182400,"04 28, 2006",2006,4896,"['may', 'think', 'supernatural', 'stories', 'are', 'played', 'out', ""'ve"", 'had', 'plenty', 'here', 'states', ""'re"", 'getting', 'much', 'more', 'overseas', 'What', 'love', 'movies', ""'re"", 'not', 'so', 'repetitive', 'get', 'tired', 'seeing', 'same', 'thing', 'over', 'again', 'kind', 'thrillers', 'always', 'get', 'something', 'different', 'Sure', 'ghosts', 'are', 'there', 'stories', 'are', 'different', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'presented', 'what', 'film', 'stand', 'alone', 'are', 'many', 'movies', 'can', 'name', 'carry', 'same', 'overall', 'topic', 'movies', 'see', 'stores', 'are', 'different', 'other', 'one', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'watch', 'movies', 'scares', 'even', 'fun', 'be', 'scared', 'can', 'just', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'story', 'relationships', 'characters', 'Heirloom', 'one', 'movies', 'Sure', 'movie', 'unknown', 'supernatural', 'force', 'films', 'story', 'Heirloom', ""n't"", 'really', 'scary', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'made', 'be', 'scary', 'movie', 'What', 'Heirloom', 'so', 'great', 'powerful', 'plot', 'twists', 'figure', 'out', 'go', 'along.Heirloom', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'old', 'family', 'house', 'place', 'move', 'bring', 'fianc', 'e', 'along', 'stay', 'house', 'man', 'slowly', 'remember', 'parts', 'childhood', 'bringing', 'back', 'old', 'memories', 'were', 'forgotten', 'age', 'house', 'dark', 'history', 'thirty', 'years', 'prior', 'entire', 'family', 'attended', 'bizarre', 'rituals', 'ended', 'up', 'committing', 'suicide', 'same', 'time', 'relative', 'hung', 'rope', 'die', 'man', 'unaware', 'family', 'history', 'witness', 'strange', 'happenings', 'involving', 'old', 'house', 'Friends', 'are', 'appearing', 'house', 'nowhere', 'others', 'are', 'being', 'killed', 'off', 'weird', 'mysterious', 'causes', 'house', 'there', 'something', 'evil', 'going', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'couple', 'dig', 'deeper', 'family', 'history', 'what', 'really', 'went', 'thirty', 'years', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'story', 'great', 'even', 'not', 'original', 'way', 'played', 'out', 'scene', 'scene', 'different', 'when', 'figure', 'out', 'mystery', 'everything', 'not', 'pleasant', 'Heirloom', 'one', 'most', 'disturbing', 'plot', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'not', 'graphic', 'idea', 'everything', 'so', 'twisted', 'wrong', 'story', 'just', 'completely', 'Heirloom', 'very', 'dramatic', 'horror', 'film', 'heart', 'pounding', 'mystery', 'likeable', 'characters', 'good', 'story', 'around', 'plot', 'dialog', 'movie', 'what', 'really', 'good', 'watch', 'been', 'so', 'long', ""'ve"", 'been', 'bothered', 'twist', 'Heirloom', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'letting', 'story', 'unfold', 'dialog', 'disturbing', 'flashbacks', 'Most', 'movie', 'fallow', 'couple', 'who', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'mystery', 'house', 'weird', 'events', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'last', 'week', 'overall', 'subject', 'deals', 'family', 'curses', 'punishments', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'deal', 'same', 'fate.The', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'using', 'different', 'views', 'house', 'give', 'more', 'creepy', 'feeling', 'house', 'large', 'dark', 'history', 'lot', 'scenes', 'blend', 'together', 'flash', 'backs', 'tell', 'story', 'give', 'more', 'questionable', 'approach', 'what', 'answer', 'everything', 'most', 'mysterious', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'everything', 'end', 'Which', 'also', 'when', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'flashbacks', 'near', 'end', 'overall', 'look', 'Heirloom', 'also', 'really', 'good', 'art', 'design', 'fantastic', 'really', 'believe', 'characters', 'are', 'staying', 'old', 'house', 'Nothing', 'too', 'fake', 'obvious', 'locations', 'are', 'fine', 'spice', 'things', 'up', 'film', 'also', 'simple', 'yet', 'perfectly', 'fitting', 'score', 'music', 'up', 'mood', 'scene', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'draw', 'attention', 'Heirloom', 'well', 'made', 'good', 'looking', 'film', 'really', 'recommend', 'watching', 'Also', 'be', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'bonus', 'understand', 'more', 'making', 'it.If', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'will', 'scare', 'living', 'daylights', 'then', 'look', 'somewhere', 'else', 'Heirloom', ""n't"", 'kind', 'movie', 'watch', 'scares', 'blood', 'guts', 'matter', 'many', 'movies', 'involving', 'supernatural', 'mysteries', 'Heirloom', 'plot', 'dialog', 'driven', 'film', 'Using', 'story', 'characters', 'set', 'mood', 'have', 'guessing', 'end', 'when', 'say', 'not', 'pleasant', 'are', 'happy', 'endings', 'events', 'picture', 'story', 'very', 'dark', 'can', 'be', 'unsettling', 'times', 'Watch', 'Heirloom', 'mystery', 'not', 'action', 'huge', 'body', 'count', 'sit', 'down', 'pay', 'attention', 'way', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'good', 'movie', ""n't"", 'supply', 'scares', 'blood', 'get', 'viewers', 'attention', 'plenty', 'drama', 'mystery']",The Heirloom
971934,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000EDWKZ6,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[7, 7]","Having taken in a number of Asian horror films in recent weeks, I have been pleasantly surprised by most.  Even those films that were not wholly successful still managed to engage me with original ideas and/or ambitious narratives.  I looked forward to ""The Heirloom,"" then, an old fashioned ghost story from Taiwan.  After a vivid and macabre opening in which a dozen members of one family hang themselves together (it's an unsettling visual), I prepared myself for a fun ride.  However, after the initial setup, Leste Chen's ""The Heirloom"" settles into a very familiar pattern.  It becomes apparent that we are going to be engaged in a thriller in which a house is possessed by evil spirits and those spirits will affect those who come into contact with them--sort of like an Asian ""Amityville Horror.""The film, in its opening scenes, establishes that the wealthy Yang family came to prosperity by worshipping the dark arts--specifically calling on the powers of child-ghosts.  The Yangs, therefore, are the family in the aforementioned mass suicide by hanging.  Dealing with the dark arts isn't always as appealing as it may at first seem!  Years later, James (Jason Yang) inherits the old mansion without knowing much of his family's history.  He promptly moves in with his fiance Yo (Terri Kwan).  Of course, it doesn't take long before strange occurrences begin--noises, visions, etc.  Most alarmingly, the house seems to be driving their friends crazy!  It is a well-worn question in films of this type, ""Why, oh why, don't they just leave?""  Yo does ask this question, a little late in the game for my taste, but is dismissed by James--which should be a bit alarming due to all that has transpired to this point.There is such a familiarity to everything that happens to our young protagonists, nothing that will come as a shock or surprise to those who follow the horror genre.  This lack of originality certainly caused me to lose some interest in the film.  But I did like Yang and Kwan enough to stick with them--and their adventures proved to be watchable, yet forgettable.  The ending, however, had a certain lyrical quality that I found appealing in light of the unpleasant circumstances.  If you like this sort of thing, there is much to be admired here--the house, in particular, is a pretty spooky place.

A horrible price and James (Jason Chang) was about to learn how he had to pay for the sins of his ancestors.James had inherit the Yang Mansion 20 years later after the entire household except one died in an inexplicable mass suicide by hanged to their deaths in the same hour, place and height, leaving the case unsolved due to it's mysterious circumstances. James decided to accept his inheritance so he could live there with his wife to be, Yo (Terri Kwan). To celebrate their new found fortune, James and Yo invited their close friends, Yi-Cheng and Ah-Tseng, to sleep over with them in the huge place.As the supernatural events unfold, James and Yo unveil the secrets of James family fortune. They found out how James's famly fortune was built on the aid of a baby ghost who fed on blood and refused the opportunity to reincarnate and somehow kind of back fired on his family after a while.Do not expect any ghostly apparition in this movie cause the movie orbits around the tragedy of James' ancestry and the Baby ghost was only a secondary factor in this movie.

971937,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000EDWKZ6,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 4]","The Heirloom (Leste Chen, 2005)I should probably just put a link to some sort of generic statement about Southeast Asian horror films*, instead of taking half of each review to explain what it is about them that cause so many of us who have discovered them to drool like yes-men trailing Gwen Stefani whenever a new one pops up. I'll keep it as short as possible--they're gorgeously shot, they have real characters, there's some depth to everything, and you never feel like anything's there for the sole purpose of advancing the plot and/or providing gratuitous sex/violence. (No, not even in Ichi the Killer.)Having said all that, I think I'm getting jaded; my problem with The Heirloom is that it's nothing but those things. Which means, automatically, it's better than all but a handful of horror movies that will come out in America this year, but still, it's as if I've come to expect something more from the area of the world that produced Miike, Tsukamoto, Hino, Fujiwara, Mous, Kurosawa (either one will do), Ozu, Park, the Pang brothers, and so many others. It's a good, solid haunted house movie--offhand, I can't remember the last American haunted house movie this good (need I go all the way back to The Changeling?)--but it's only a good, solid haunted house movie. Which doesn't sound like it should be a letdown. And I'm not sure why it is.James (Jason Chang) has come back to Taiwan after twenty years in England. It's never really clarified what he does for a living (for some reason I got the feeling he was an investment banker), but it doesn't seem to mind to much, the guy's family recently died. Yes, all of them. And while the family's gone through some rough financial times recently, it's a lot harder to support a large family than to support just yourself and your fianc&eacute;e Yo (the stunning Terri Kwan, soon to be seen in the highly-anticipated My DNA Says I Love You), so relatively, James is rich as Croesus. To help matters along, he also inherited the family homestead, a massive mansion of a building that's got some weird stories flying around about it. The first person to feel the effects of the house is Yo's best friend Yi-Chen (Yu-chan Chang-- no relation to Jason, that I can tell), who keeps finding herself inside the house, dazed, when she wakes up. And things just get weirder from there. James seems oblivious, so it's up to Yo to figure out what's going on with the house.Despite my rather faint, confused criticisms above, I rush to point out that this is, as I said, a good, solid movie, watchable and enjoyable. The ending makes something of an annoying nod to the [...] endings filmmakers have been foisting off on Americans for years, but even that's kind of forgivable in the vein of ""it's not the destination, it's the journey."" Note that I will revise that statement if The Heirloom II pops up. But as of this writing, I recommend it; I just don't recommend it as strongly as I do most other Southeast Asian horror flicks. ****Note that this does not just apply to horror films any more.

971939,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000EDWKZ6,Tim Janson,"[1, 2]","The Heirloom is a Korean ghost film that thankfully has nothing to do with other popular Asian horror films. There's not a hint of the Grudge or The Ring, and no site at all of creepy long hair ghosts stalking about. If anything, The Heirloom is far more influenced by American haunted house films and or novels such as The Haunting, The Shining, and even The House of the Seven Gables with is family curses being played out over generations. The film calls to mind those 60's and 70's haunted house flicks that relied on atmosphere and suspense, as opposed to today's CGI-laden entries. While not as masterful as The Haunting or The Shining, the film is deftly woven with horrifying plot elements.James Yang is a young architect who has just inherited a mansion outside of Taipei, in Taiwan. It is an ornate mansion although it's fallen into disrepair as paint is peeling off all the walls and water drips from the ceiling during storms. One curious note: when James is first shown the home by the estate attorney, it's described as being 2,600 square feet. I think someone missed a digit in the subtitles, as this is a massive home. Perhaps it was supposed to be 12,600 feet or even 26,000 square feet. It looks more like a hotel than a mansion. James decides to keep the home and moves in with his fianc&eacute;, Yo.Almost immediately their friends Liu Tin-Cheng and Yi-Chen begin to act strangely after being inside the house. They are found inside the home late at night with no memory of how they got there. Liu is soon found dead in his bathtub of an apparent suicide by hanging and yet no rope was found at the scene. Not long after, the detective investigating the suicide is also found dead within the house with his hands completely torn off their wrists...Yo soon meets the only surviving member of the Yang family besides James, his aunt who has been locked away in an asylum for twenty years. She relates to Yo the dark secret of the Yang family and how they practiced the black art of Hsiao-Guei, the raising of the ghosts of dead fetuses to have them do your bidding!The Heirloom is very heavy on atmosphere. The house itself is suitably ghostly with all sorts of creaking doors and strange shadows and noises. The cinematography is simply gorgeous. The house eerily lit but not so dark that you cannot tell what is going on. The camera work was outstanding as well with elegant panning and rotating shots. In particular the last 15 minutes, which have a minimal amount of dialog, are quite beautiful. Yo is a dancer by trade and these last few moments of the climax are like watching a tragic ballet unfold.However, a good horror film needs much more than good atmosphere and good cinematography. It also needs some genuine scares. Despite the overall chilling look of the film there were no ""jump out of your seat moments"" which is quite odd since these have become such a staple of the Asian horror film. The premise itself was solid but Director Leste Chen simply did not get enough out of it. There were also some rather curious plot elements that were simply forgotten. After the police detective is killed, the other cops view a surveillance tape that goes blurry every time the detective appears on it. But there is no follow up, and the police presence disappears completely after this scene. You'd think they be a bit more interested in one of their own being killed so mysteriously.Bottom line: Heirloom has a lot of style but simply not enough substance to be considered a top tier horror film.The DVD has a nice set of extras including a commentary by the Director and Screenwriter, deleted scenes, trailers, and a 23-minute long ""making of"" documentary. The only problem is there are no subtitles on the documentary although there are on the commentary track.REVIEWED BY TIM JANSON",3,LOTS OF STYLE BUT LITTLE SUBSTANCE,1189728000,"09 14, 2007",2007,3811,"['Heirloom', 'Korean', 'ghost', 'film', 'thankfully', 'nothing', 'do', 'other', 'popular', 'Asian', 'horror', 'films', 'not', 'hint', 'Grudge', 'Ring', 'site', 'creepy', 'long', 'hair', 'ghosts', 'stalking', 'about', 'anything', 'Heirloom', 'far', 'more', 'influenced', 'American', 'haunted', 'house', 'films', 'novels', 'such', 'Haunting', 'Shining', 'even', 'House', 'Seven', 'Gables', 'family', 'curses', 'being', 'played', 'out', 'generations', 'film', 'mind', '60', '70', 'haunted', 'house', 'relied', 'atmosphere', 'suspense', 'opposed', 'today', 'CGI-laden', 'entries', 'not', 'as', 'masterful', 'Haunting', 'Shining', 'film', 'deftly', 'woven', 'horrifying', 'plot', 'elements.James', 'Yang', 'young', 'architect', 'who', 'just', 'inherited', 'mansion', 'Taipei', 'Taiwan', 'ornate', 'mansion', 'fallen', 'disrepair', 'paint', 'peeling', 'off', 'walls', 'water', 'drips', 'ceiling', 'storms', 'One', 'curious', 'note', 'when', 'James', 'first', 'shown', 'home', 'estate', 'attorney', 'described', 'being', '2,600', 'square', 'feet', 'think', 'someone', 'missed', 'digit', 'subtitles', 'massive', 'home', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', '12,600', 'feet', 'even', '26,000', 'square', 'feet', 'more', 'hotel', 'mansion', 'James', 'keep', 'home', 'moves', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Yo.Almost', 'immediately', 'friends', 'Liu', 'Tin-Cheng', 'Yi-Chen', 'begin', 'act', 'strangely', 'being', 'house', 'are', 'found', 'home', 'late', 'night', 'memory', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'Liu', 'soon', 'found', 'dead', 'bathtub', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'hanging', 'yet', 'rope', 'was', 'found', 'scene', 'Not', 'long', 'detective', 'investigating', 'suicide', 'also', 'found', 'dead', 'house', 'hands', 'completely', 'torn', 'off', 'wrists', 'Yo', 'soon', 'only', 'surviving', 'member', 'Yang', 'family', 'James', 'aunt', 'who', 'been', 'locked', 'away', 'asylum', 'twenty', 'years', 'Yo', 'dark', 'secret', 'Yang', 'family', 'how', 'practiced', 'black', 'art', 'Hsiao-Guei', 'raising', 'ghosts', 'dead', 'fetuses', 'have', 'do', 'bidding', 'Heirloom', 'very', 'heavy', 'atmosphere', 'house', 'suitably', 'ghostly', 'sorts', 'creaking', 'doors', 'strange', 'shadows', 'noises', 'cinematography', 'simply', 'gorgeous', 'house', 'eerily', 'lit', 'not', 'so', 'dark', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'what', 'going', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'outstanding', 'as', 'well', 'elegant', 'panning', 'rotating', 'shots', 'particular', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'have', 'minimal', 'amount', 'dialog', 'are', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'Yo', 'dancer', 'trade', 'last', 'few', 'moments', 'climax', 'are', 'watching', 'tragic', 'ballet', 'unfold.However', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'good', 'atmosphere', 'good', 'cinematography', 'also', 'genuine', 'scares', 'overall', 'chilling', 'look', 'film', 'were', 'jump', 'seat', 'moments', 'quite', 'odd', 'have', 'become', 'staple', 'Asian', 'horror', 'film', 'premise', 'was', 'solid', 'Director', 'Leste', 'Chen', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'were', 'also', 'rather', 'curious', 'plot', 'elements', 'were', 'simply', 'forgotten', 'police', 'detective', 'killed', 'other', 'cops', 'view', 'surveillance', 'tape', 'blurry', 'time', 'detective', 'follow', 'up', 'police', 'presence', 'completely', 'scene', ""'d"", 'think', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'interested', 'one', 'own', 'being', 'killed', 'so', 'mysteriously.Bottom', 'line', 'Heirloom', 'lot', 'style', 'simply', 'not', 'enough', 'substance', 'be', 'considered', 'top', 'tier', 'horror', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'nice', 'set', 'extras', 'including', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Screenwriter', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'trailers', '23-minute', 'long', 'making', 'documentary', 'only', 'problem', 'are', 'subtitles', 'documentary', 'are', 'commentary', 'track.REVIEWED', 'BY', 'TIM', 'JANSON']",The Heirloom
