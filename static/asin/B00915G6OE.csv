It was renewed for a ninth season of 17 episodes, with all principal cast members returning.  The show continues to feature compelling crime of the week mysteries, to be solved by a closely knit ensemble cast working with the latest CSI techniques in New York, the City that Never Sleeps.As always, the show shines a spotlight on individual season regulars from week to week.  Among the highlights: Senior Detective Mac Taylor (Gary Sinese) returns to the CSI lab after surviving a nearly fatal gunshot wound at the end of season eight.  Mac is crustier than ever, and struggling with the after-effects of his wound, which include troublesome short term memory loss.  The affliction affects his relationships within the lab, especially with close friend Jo Danville (Sela Ward).  Mac and Jo will have to work it out on a case that takes them to San Francisco.  Mac's relationship with girlfriend Christine Whitney will evolve in unexpected ways, and will be the subject of a cross-over episode with CSI in Las Vegas.Detective Lindsey Monroe (Anna Belknap) works to balance marriage (to Detecter Danny Messer) and motherhood with her job.  In one extended story arc, her youth in Montana will reach out to touch her present life in New York, when she is called back to testify in an old and very personal murder case.  Detective Don Flack (Eddie Cahill) will work through some longstanding family issues early in the season. He will spend much of the season working with a new partner, an attractive former undercover cop named Lovato, who presents a number of professional and personal challenges.  Lab rat Adam (A.J. Buckley) will get a love interest and a startling episode featuring his father.Several episodes will feature clever constructs. One of them will pit Mac and his lab against a killer playing a life-sized and lethal game of ""Clue.""  Another case, involving a woman found dead in a pond, requires the crew to find a missing witness based on the thinnest of evidence.  Still another case will feature Lindsey's not so secret search for a prankster in the lab.  The season finale features an especially tough and emotional case that causes Mac Taylor to question the trajectory of his life.""CSI: NY"" continues to be a good police procedural that invests in its characters, and is highly recommended to its fans in its ninth season on CBS.",5,Ninth Inning?...,1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,2452,"['Much', 'relief', 'fans', 'CSI', 'NY', 'dodged', 'cancellation', 'end', '2011-2012', 'TV', 'season', 'was', 'renewed', 'ninth', 'season', '17', 'episodes', 'principal', 'cast', 'members', 'returning', 'show', 'feature', 'compelling', 'crime', 'week', 'mysteries', 'be', 'solved', 'closely', 'knit', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'working', 'latest', 'CSI', 'techniques', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Never', 'Sleeps.As', 'always', 'show', 'spotlight', 'individual', 'season', 'regulars', 'week', 'week', 'highlights', 'Senior', 'Detective', 'Mac', 'Taylor', 'Gary', 'Sinese', 'CSI', 'lab', 'surviving', 'nearly', 'fatal', 'gunshot', 'wound', 'end', 'season', 'eight', 'Mac', 'crustier', 'ever', 'struggling', 'after-effects', 'wound', 'include', 'troublesome', 'short', 'term', 'memory', 'loss', 'affliction', 'relationships', 'lab', 'especially', 'close', 'friend', 'Jo', 'Danville', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'Mac', 'Jo', 'will', 'have', 'work', 'out', 'case', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Mac', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'Christine', 'Whitney', 'will', 'evolve', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'will', 'be', 'subject', 'cross-over', 'episode', 'CSI', 'Las', 'Vegas.Detective', 'Lindsey', 'Monroe', 'Anna', 'Belknap', 'balance', 'marriage', 'Detecter', 'Danny', 'Messer', 'motherhood', 'job', 'one', 'extended', 'story', 'arc', 'youth', 'Montana', 'will', 'reach', 'out', 'touch', 'present', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'when', 'called', 'back', 'testify', 'old', 'very', 'personal', 'murder', 'case', 'Detective', 'Don', 'Flack', 'Eddie', 'Cahill', 'will', 'work', 'longstanding', 'family', 'issues', 'early', 'season', 'will', 'spend', 'much', 'season', 'working', 'new', 'partner', 'attractive', 'former', 'undercover', 'cop', 'named', 'Lovato', 'who', 'number', 'professional', 'personal', 'challenges', 'Lab', 'rat', 'Adam', 'A.J', 'Buckley', 'will', 'get', 'love', 'interest', 'startling', 'episode', 'featuring', 'father.Several', 'episodes', 'will', 'feature', 'clever', 'constructs', 'One', 'will', 'pit', 'Mac', 'lab', 'killer', 'playing', 'life-sized', 'lethal', 'game', 'Clue', 'case', 'involving', 'woman', 'found', 'dead', 'pond', 'crew', 'find', 'missing', 'witness', 'based', 'thinnest', 'evidence', 'Still', 'case', 'will', 'feature', 'Lindsey', 'not', 'so', 'secret', 'search', 'prankster', 'lab', 'season', 'finale', 'especially', 'tough', 'emotional', 'case', 'Mac', 'Taylor', 'question', 'trajectory', 'life', 'CSI', 'NY', 'be', 'good', 'police', 'procedural', 'characters', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'ninth', 'season', 'CBS']",CSI: NY - The Final Season
