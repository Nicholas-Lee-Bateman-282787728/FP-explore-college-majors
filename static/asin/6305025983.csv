444535,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,6305025983,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[10, 12]","Like so many others, I too have become a recent Vosloo watcher and bought the DVD of this film for that reason.  This is not a film I would have purchased ordinarily, nor would I have attended it in a theater.  (I spend  too much of my time keeping others alive to relish watching someone else  trash viable young adults in the full bloom of youth and life).  Still, one  can hardly but appreciate the talent that went into bringing Stephan to  reality on the screen.  I have met two psychopathic personalities, one  professionally while I was working on a neurology ward and one in private  life while I was living in Egypt.  In both instances in retrospect, I am  especially amazed at the skill they exhibited in enlisting the cooperation  of their victims--myself among others--in their enterprises.  One not only  believed in what they said and did, one actually WANTED to believe in what  they said and did.  Nor if I were to have a third encounter with such an  individual could I honestly say I would be any the less vulnerable for the  experience.  Mr. Vosloo's characterization of Stephan is, therefore, not  only creditable it is positively chilling.  (One wonders how he went about  preparing for the role.) His ability to show up virtually everywhere  without warning was also effective (though not unpredictable given the  genre).  The only film I've seen wherein the character--in this case a  female--was more effectively menacing, merciless, and everywhere is an  Egyptian film in Arabic, entitled Shamps.  Mr. Busey's character was also  believable in that he entered a web of terror of his own volition (and  probably arrogance) with Mr. Vosloo's very dangerous spider waiting for him  in the middle of it.  His ineffectual efforts to escape it and his ultimate  involvement of others in the terror is also creditable. My only criticism  of the film is that the story behind the title character's madness was  neglected, religated to the experience of a disillusioned teenager--though  recent events have proved graphically how violent and tragic that can  become--this was, after all, the diary of a serial killer, and I would have  liked to have known more about the making of such a madman.  Over all,  though I cannot honestly say I &quot;liked&quot; the film, I still thought  it was a good one.",4,Madness Explored,951177600,"02 22, 2000",2000,2318,"['so', 'many', 'others', 'too', 'have', 'become', 'recent', 'Vosloo', 'watcher', 'bought', 'DVD', 'film', 'reason', 'not', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'purchased', 'ordinarily', 'would', 'have', 'attended', 'theater', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'keeping', 'others', 'alive', 'relish', 'watching', 'someone', 'else', 'trash', 'viable', 'young', 'adults', 'full', 'bloom', 'youth', 'life', 'Still', 'one', 'can', 'hardly', 'appreciate', 'talent', 'went', 'bringing', 'Stephan', 'reality', 'screen', 'have', 'met', 'two', 'psychopathic', 'personalities', 'one', 'professionally', 'was', 'working', 'neurology', 'ward', 'one', 'private', 'life', 'was', 'living', 'Egypt', 'instances', 'retrospect', 'am', 'especially', 'amazed', 'skill', 'exhibited', 'enlisting', 'cooperation', 'victims', 'others', 'enterprises', 'One', 'not', 'only', 'believed', 'what', 'said', 'did', 'one', 'actually', 'WANTED', 'believe', 'what', 'said', 'did', 'were', 'have', 'third', 'encounter', 'individual', 'could', 'honestly', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'less', 'vulnerable', 'experience', 'Mr.', 'Vosloo', 'characterization', 'Stephan', 'therefore', 'not', 'only', 'creditable', 'positively', 'chilling', 'One', 'how', 'went', 'preparing', 'role', 'ability', 'show', 'up', 'virtually', 'everywhere', 'warning', 'was', 'also', 'effective', 'not', 'unpredictable', 'given', 'genre', 'only', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'character', 'case', 'female', 'was', 'more', 'effectively', 'menacing', 'merciless', 'everywhere', 'Egyptian', 'film', 'Arabic', 'entitled', 'Shamps', 'Mr.', 'Busey', 'character', 'was', 'also', 'believable', 'entered', 'web', 'terror', 'own', 'volition', 'probably', 'arrogance', 'Mr.', 'Vosloo', 'very', 'dangerous', 'spider', 'waiting', 'middle', 'ineffectual', 'efforts', 'escape', 'ultimate', 'involvement', 'others', 'terror', 'also', 'creditable', 'only', 'criticism', 'film', 'story', 'title', 'character', 'madness', 'was', 'neglected', 'religated', 'experience', 'disillusioned', 'teenager', 'recent', 'events', 'have', 'proved', 'graphically', 'how', 'violent', 'tragic', 'can', 'become', 'was', 'diary', 'serial', 'killer', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'known', 'more', 'making', 'such', 'madman', 'can', 'not', 'honestly', 'say', 'quot', 'liked', 'quot', 'film', 'still', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'one']",N/A

E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Diary of a Serial Killer is a pretty good film, though the woman who played the main character probably needed some lesson skills before attempting position as lead role.  Oh well, she was hot, and that makes up for it in my young and innocent mind, lol.The story is about a man who's really messed up in the head.  He goes around killing men and women in graphic and violent ways.  He does so by sneaking around (usually late at night) makes sure the people are alone, and finds a way to murder them.  Yeah, he's a real mean guy.The woman who stars in the film is a hot, long-haired blonde who goes around trying to figure out the clues that will eventually lead to finding the murderer.  Throughout the movie we are treated to scenes involving one disturbingly violent murder after another.The way the serial killer changes his facial appearance for each of the murders, and the way the storyline goes through the mind of a man who apparently has NOTHING to lose makes Diary of a Serial Killer a pretty good movie from beginning to end.  I wish the acting could have been better though, because that would have definitely made the film even better in my mind.The actual violent scenes are EXTREMELY violent.  I have to warn you about that.  Numerous kills in the movie deal with bullet blasts directly to the head, which leads to blood shooting on the wall behind the victims body.This is one example where poor acting does NOT distract from the enjoyment and the believability of the storyline.",5,bad acting aside... a good film,1256601600,"10 27, 2009",2009,1497,"['Diary', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'woman', 'who', 'played', 'main', 'character', 'probably', 'needed', 'lesson', 'skills', 'attempting', 'position', 'lead', 'role', 'Oh', 'well', 'was', 'hot', 'up', 'young', 'innocent', 'mind', 'lol.The', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'messed', 'up', 'head', 'killing', 'men', 'women', 'graphic', 'violent', 'ways', 'so', 'sneaking', 'around', 'usually', 'late', 'night', 'sure', 'people', 'are', 'alone', 'way', 'murder', 'Yeah', 'real', 'mean', 'guy.The', 'woman', 'who', 'film', 'hot', 'long-haired', 'blonde', 'who', 'around', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'clues', 'will', 'eventually', 'lead', 'finding', 'murderer', 'movie', 'are', 'treated', 'scenes', 'involving', 'one', 'disturbingly', 'violent', 'murder', 'another.The', 'way', 'serial', 'killer', 'changes', 'facial', 'appearance', 'murders', 'way', 'storyline', 'mind', 'man', 'who', 'apparently', 'NOTHING', 'lose', 'Diary', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'beginning', 'end', 'wish', 'acting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'definitely', 'made', 'film', 'even', 'better', 'mind.The', 'actual', 'violent', 'scenes', 'are', 'EXTREMELY', 'violent', 'have', 'warn', 'Numerous', 'kills', 'movie', 'deal', 'bullet', 'blasts', 'directly', 'head', 'blood', 'shooting', 'wall', 'victims', 'body.This', 'one', 'example', 'where', 'poor', 'acting', 'NOT', 'distract', 'enjoyment', 'believability', 'storyline']",N/A
444537,A364W6U6YL219D,6305025983,"Craig Edwards ""Media Guy""","[0, 0]","Diary of a Serial Killer (1997) Gary Busey, Arnold Vosloo, and Michael Madsen star in this low budget thriller. Busey plays Nelson, the kind of journalist so committed (or needing to be committed) he'll go on a several week alcohol binge or throw on a wig and dress to write articles ""through the eyes"" of alcoholics and crossdressers. When he accidentally stumbles across one of serial killer Stefan's murders, it looks bad for Nelson, until Stefan (Vosloo) decides he'd like the journalist to start a new project: ""Through the Eyes of a Killer."" As he puts the nutjob off as best he can, Busey tries to contact cop Madsen several times, but the creepy Vosloo has a way of turning up each time and stopping him. Eventually, Stefan forces Nelson along for one of his killings and then starts eyeing Busey's girlfriend (Julia Campbell) as a potential victim. Will Nelson be able to stop Stefan, or having seen through the eyes of the killer, will he be corrupted into a life of murder? This one turned out okay, carried along more by the cast than anything else. In terms of their performances, all three actors add to this movie, but Vosloo is 100% into his role, Busey is 90-95%, and Madsen is his usual 70% or so. Busey seems a tiny bit uncomfortable as the hero, and it might have been interesting if he and Vosloo had switched parts. Madsen simply always seems a little bored, and weirdly, he just disappears from the movie in a way that more suggests behind the scenes strife than coherent screenwriting. There's not a whole lot of objectionable material happening here in terms of gore or nudity, so this one might also come off a bit TV movie-ish, so I can only really recommend it to fans of the stars or serial killer kompletists.",3,"Dear Diary, today I eliminated a bowl of Froot Loops.

We don't really find out why Vosloo does what he does.  While Vosloo's performance is effectively chilling, Busey is horribly miscast.  His journalist role is weakly performed, and little conviction is evidenced in his relationship with Vosloo or his live in girl friend (the lovely Julia Campbell).  Add Michael Masden (B movie's Bruce Willis) as a cop whose daughter was killed by a serial killer and Reno Wilson as his obligatory African American partner, and the soup thickens.  Masden sleepwalks and Wilson tries to be Ice T.  Wilson's actions at the end of the movie are highly unprofessional and hard to swallow.This could have been a better movie with a tighter script and someone else in Busey's role.",2,DIARY-EA,1102204800,"12 5, 2004",2004,846,"['Gary', 'Busey', 'Arnold', 'Vosloo', 'star', 'lukewarm', 'thriller', 'diminished', 'pedestrian', 'script', 'failure', 'really', 'be', 'diary', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'Vosloo', 'what', 'Vosloo', 'performance', 'effectively', 'chilling', 'Busey', 'horribly', 'miscast', 'journalist', 'role', 'weakly', 'performed', 'little', 'conviction', 'evidenced', 'relationship', 'Vosloo', 'live', 'girl', 'friend', 'lovely', 'Julia', 'Campbell', 'Add', 'Michael', 'Masden', 'B', 'movie', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'cop', 'daughter', 'was', 'killed', 'serial', 'killer', 'Reno', 'Wilson', 'obligatory', 'African', 'American', 'partner', 'soup', 'Masden', 'sleepwalks', 'Wilson', 'tries', 'be', 'Ice', 'T.', 'Wilson', 'actions', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'highly', 'unprofessional', 'hard', 'swallow.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'tighter', 'script', 'someone', 'else', 'Busey', 'role']",N/A
