This is as Paul Harvey would say...&#34;the rest of the story&#34;. These brave former government workers are blowing the whistle on what goes on. It takes a special person to want to know, what they DON'T want to know, and to hear, what they DON'T want to hear. It's way past time to turn the lights on and dispel the darkness that would take away our freedom. Great documentary that every freedom loving American should see and show to everyone you know, who will be willing to face the reality that has become our New America. To be forewarned is to be forearmed! We all need to wake up and step up to the plate to protect our freedom, and support those who will stand up with us and for us! Once it's gone, it can not be regained. Remember this quote from one of our founding fathers, &#34;Those who would sacrifice their freedom for security, will have neither.&#34; Another quote from Benjamin Franklin...&#34;If you make yourself a sheep, you will be eaten by wolves.&#34; Inform yourself! Stand up! Speak up, or give up, these are the only 2 choices we have.",5,"Great documentary every American should see! Get informed, then inform others.
