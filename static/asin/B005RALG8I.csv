1497953,A75KD0YWU2AK7,B005RALG8I,Galen Halimar,"[0, 0]","This expensive and rare DVD of an early 1930s movie featured Edna May Oliver as the old maid schoolteacher and James Gleason as the detective who needs her help to solve a murder at a New York aquarium.  I believe this duo starred in two other movies of that era but I have seen only one other, the Murder on a Honeymoon.  I liked the latter one better, but the Penguin Pool Murder was worth seeing if you enjoy films of the 30s and the classic ability of Oliver and Gleason, who play off each other very well.  A good mixture of fun and mystery.",4,Schoolmarm's Curiosity Solves Mystery,1353196800,"11 18, 2012",2012,546,"['expensive', 'rare', 'DVD', 'early', '1930s', 'movie', 'featured', 'Edna', 'May', 'Oliver', 'old', 'maid', 'schoolteacher', 'James', 'Gleason', 'detective', 'who', 'help', 'solve', 'murder', 'New', 'York', 'aquarium', 'believe', 'duo', 'starred', 'two', 'other', 'movies', 'era', 'have', 'seen', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'Murder', 'Honeymoon', 'liked', 'latter', 'one', 'better', 'Penguin', 'Pool', 'Murder', 'was', 'worth', 'seeing', 'enjoy', 'films', '30s', 'classic', 'ability', 'Oliver', 'Gleason', 'who', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'very', 'well', 'good', 'mixture', 'fun', 'mystery']",Penguin Pool Murder 1932 DVD James Gleason Edna May Oliver [All-Region]

1497956,A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B005RALG8I,"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF ""Wolf""","[12, 12]","Edna May Oliver was perfectly cast in the Penguin Pool Murder.  What makes her perfect is everything.  Her voice is so perfectly modulated with bi-tonal inflection's which gave her that spinster like school mom voice akin to that of former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt.  Her odd vocal intonations just sends chills down one's spine.  Her pupils were a cross section of cultures with little racial stereotyping again VERY unusual for the time (1932).  The Penguin Pool Murder movie is both a solid comedy and a solid who done it!  The running gag suggesting her students were uncultured oafs came when one of the children kept thinking ""Penguins"" were ""Ducks"" after being told otherwise.  The Murder was called in by a student telling the police that there was a dead guy found swimming with the ""Ducks!""  The ""Penquin's as Ducks"" gags were always funny.  James Gleason is also perfectly cast as the crusty old somewhat jaded defective detective who needs teacher Edna's little logical nudges to assemble the clues needed to finally crack the case.  Gleason's role as a Police Detective revealed the fictional officers own low cultured birth as he too continually suggested their was a dead guy found swimming with the ""Ducks"" when in fact the dead guy was in a pool with ""Penguins!""  There was a distinct Film Noir quality to this crime spoof as the lighting, shows and odd angles lent a gritty urban backdrop to the goings on.I will give no spoilers here.  The transfer quality of my DVD copy was totally excellent sharp clear black and white with no cloudly fuzzy lame areas.  Sound quality again was first rate.  Not too low, high or shrill.  No projector noise or dirt in my print.  I have always loved this DVD and it was on sale for such a short time I was honored and lucky to get a copy.  This DVD is a pure treasure.  This DVD is one of the diamonds in my collection.  There is something funny about this DVD that can brighten my worse most troubled days.  This DVD is just plain fun to watch.  It is just enough film Noir to be taken seriously but just enough fun to be a comedic romp a rare combination presented very expertly!  As another reviewer noted this is one in a short lived series staring this character pair.  The world would be a better place were all the movies in this series were released.  I'd gladly pay for the full set staring this dynamic comedy duo.",5,Oh Man THIS IS THE GREATEST!
