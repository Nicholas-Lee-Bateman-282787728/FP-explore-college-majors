893530,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,B0007XBMSO,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[1, 1]","Elvis Costello brought his Delivery Man tour to Memphis for two club shows at the Hi Tone Cafe on September 16, 2004. Playing with the Imposters (Steve Nieve, Pete Thomas and Danny Faragher), Costello performs a quick though edited 25 song show that allowed him to play some of his older material (Radio, Radio; The Mystery Dance; Alison; Pump It Up) along with ten songs from his then new album, The Delivery Man. Also included are three duets with Emmylou Harris.The picture quality and sound are excellent on the Blu-Ray version of the disc. If there is any problem with the set it is that the show seems overly edited at times. This may have been to put the best cuts from the two show stand on one disc. It would have been better perhaps to have gone for the complete show warts and all type of presentation since four tracks obviosly from the same set are added as a bonus feature.The disc includes a well made documentary ""Off the Beaten Path"" which shows Costello and drummer Pete Thomas as they tour the South from Memphis to Oxford, Mississippi where the Delivery Man was recorded.This is a good disc that gives a fairly good retrospective of Costello's career.

This is my favorite Elvis Costello DVD. You get a line-up of Elvis on guitar & lead vocals, Steve Nieve on keyboards & flutes, Pete Thomas on drums & a bass guitar player(I can't remember his name right now, but he is an excellent bass guitar player. He replaced the original bass player who was in the ""Attractions"".I got to see this line-up of Elvis and this band at the 2005 New Orleans Jazz Festival and they were outstanding. This dvd was released just before the Jazz Festival that year. I was in the New Orleans French Quarter the night before their performance, I had just purchased this dvd from the ""Mega Virgin Music Store"", and I happened to come face to face with Elvis & this band on Canal Street. I was surprised, I followed them down Bourbon Street, and found myself walking next the Pete Thomas. I asked him if he thought it'd be okay, if I asked Elvis for an Autograph. He told me to ""go for it"". So I kindly asked Elvis for an autograph, and he signed the cover of my DVD of this concert, right on the front cover. I was real impressed with how friendly Elvis & his band were.Now, the DVD - This is the Elvis style that I really like. This dvd showcases songs from the album he had just released ""The Delivery Man"". I also have the ""Deluxe Version"", 2 disc cd of that release. It was recorded in Memphis, Clarksdale, Ms. & Oxford, Ms. Also, in the dvd, you get to watch Elvis & the Imposters perform some of their ""rock"" classics.You get a special guest artist: EmmyLou Harris (She & Elvis do some great duets). You get a basic song set of 20 songs, plus 4 more bonus songs.You also get an ""outstanding"" special feature where Elvis & Pete Thomas take a Road Trip Documentary ""Off the Beaten Path"" They are in a 1950'S cadillac with a Chaufeur. They travel through Memphis, the Mississippi Delta (including Clarksdale, MS), and Helena, Arkansas (They cross the Mississpi River). Then they venture back into Mississippi and into the Mississippi ""Hill Country"" and go to Oxford, MS (the home of Ole Miss).This is an outstanding concert dvd with excellent bonus material, and I highly, gladly recommend it.

Elvis and his band GRABS you by the throat, live and video audiences both included, and takes you on a roller coaster ride which ONLY goes up. You never go down. Video is great, sound is even better. The wonderful mix is an example of how to do 5.1 RIGHT. It's not about ""effects"" and making you think crap is behind you when it isn't (for music shows anyways). It is for IMMERSING you, enveloping your senses, and putting you THERE in the sweat, the smell and taste of beer and smoke and the fire of a singer and a band just giving you EVERYTHING. The wonderful Emmylou makes an appearance and brings tears to your  eyes, and you're THERE.Do yourself a favor. Experience this show. Own it, live it. It is so well done that you'll watch it again and again. Musicians take heed to the ""space"" given to the other players in the ensemble, and how ""space"" adds so much to a performance. As well, the delivery and honesty that Elvis gives is so missing from so many current manufactured (for lack of a better word) ""pop bands"" out there. Having ""Elvis"" in Memphis live, on a perfect night, with a perfectly edited performance (compiled from several performances) is just ""right"". You'll not want your night to end. Live it over and over...and pray that EC and his band keep giving us stuff like this. The eclectic mixture of styles takes you on a real adventure you'll not forget. I envy those who were there.

Freecycled the tix to a thrilled fan who had 1 hour to get there and I was sad all night... tho I met some great fans online that week. But I gotta tell ya, when this showed up in my mailbox and I got to spend my evening with Elvis in my livingroom, I whooped it up so loud that even the hubby went outside to work in the garden. He loves Elvis too, but I was up close and personal with one of THE best musicians in the last 30 years.This DVD has a few faults, but for an Elvis fan and one who has been keeping up with his most recent recordings, there is nothing like it. I had a blast watching, and even more intriguing is the road trip filmed as Elvis and his drummer talk blues and early influences (while seated fittingly enough in the back seat of a '55 T-bird) through Memphis.We get to travel on into Mississippi as if we are just another member of the elite few and enter the recording studio to play a tune, then saunter on to help pick out the blue suit that made him flash his best while playing the club.The sound at the venue is a bit outa whack at first, but I could do more with it than if I were stuck in a bad seat at the concert -- and by the end, the soundman got it to balance out well. The energy is hot, the tunes both old and new, especially the skiff played with his $150 ""so bad its good"" guitar that had the price tag and a note ""George Harrison's second guitar"" still attached.What a night it was! What joy! How wonderful that I didn't have to ride 2 hours, brave the cold, get shoved into a corner in my wheelchair (escorted by a not-too-thrilled hubby who has to drive to Denver every day) and sit through the night of a gig to remember and the leftover ears ringing.The mountains my home, the first hummingbird of the season showed up when I was watching this, and the basset hounds even cuddled up to my side when we got to Emmylou's duet with the dude who put the name ""Costello"" into the limelight again -- whose on first? Elvis!Buy it. I am sending it to the guy who just missed out on the tickets that I gave away (but who sent me a grand cd of a rare interview with our number one fan).We'll see him live one day: This amazing artist is now the only one I am willing to leave the house and brave the pain of going to a concert after 55 years young.....  I frankly enjoyed this more than if I had made it to Denver and back....

His singing, which is usually out of this world, is not as great as usual. For instance, during Blue Chair, I noticed him take the low road on the high notes a lot. High Fidelity, one of the highlights of his catalog, rarely performed live, and here it is rushed and just not that great.Elvis seems over weight, puffy, and really sweaty. Not looking comfortable at all. Remember the time he sang God Give Me Strength on Letterman a few years ago? Remember how he loosened his tie and seemed to launch into the song and just leave the planet? After he finished it seemed to take him a moment to come back down.

Add in Emmylou Harris, and what you have is an essential document. EC needs to look at this DVD every time he imagines he's Arvo Part or Mel Torme, or whatever other preposterous notion fills his head. Even more, his record label should have thid DVD playing everytime he pitches some monotonous idea at them. If ever there was an argument for not allowing an ""artiste"" to express himself, Costello is it.Within the confines of rock music he writes some great tunes and witty, if verbose, lyrics. The boy likes to impress himself, and often enough it works, mate. Stick to the knitting.This concert crackles from the very start. This band has the juice and the sophistication to tackle chestnuts and new songs with aplomb. And as I say, add in Emmylou Harris, and you have an extraodinary show. Harris manages to elevate the quality, the passion, the soulfulness of anything and everything she is involved in, be it music, film, or standing in line at Starbucks. She eclipses the pudgy runt from Liverpool with grace and humanity and takes what are very good songs on their own terms and recasts them altogether in more sublime lighting. Hers is the voice touched by God or Music itself and the gang here owe her a big debt.If you are a Costello fan, and sometimes I am, you will welcome a return to what he should be doing.

He also takes us on a long tour of the Southern locales that have inspired him throughout his career. His vocal and instrumental chops are first-rate, whether he is performing solo or with the band, acoustic or electric, before stomping, hooting crowds, or alone with a piano in a small studio. He meets performers and fans and really seems to enjoy talking to them.(I saw Elvis in a one-man show in Seattle in 2005, and he has never been better. At the peak of his form, and with just a guitar and an empty stage, he put on a long, ebullient, and amazingly rich performance, filling a stadium with thousands of his fans who stood in rapt attention when they weren't cheering and singing along, playing hit after hit from the length and breadth of his oeuvre.)Get this DVD to understand the power of Elvis live!",5,I wanna PUMP IT UP!!!,1145059200,"04 15, 2006",2006,1037,"['few', 'reviewers', 'have', 'given', 'DVD', 'indifferent', 'ratings', ""'d"", 'like', 'change', 'this.The', 'disc', 'great', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'Elvis', 'heart', 'out', 'stage', 'duets', 'Emmylou', 'Harris', 'are', 'nothing', 'less', 'sublime', 'also', 'long', 'tour', 'Southern', 'have', 'inspired', 'career', 'vocal', 'instrumental', 'chops', 'are', 'first-rate', 'performing', 'solo', 'band', 'acoustic', 'electric', 'stomping', 'hooting', 'crowds', 'alone', 'piano', 'small', 'studio', 'performers', 'fans', 'really', 'enjoy', 'talking', 'saw', 'Elvis', 'one-man', 'show', 'Seattle', '2005', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'peak', 'form', 'just', 'guitar', 'empty', 'stage', 'put', 'long', 'ebullient', 'amazingly', 'rich', 'performance', 'filling', 'stadium', 'thousands', 'fans', 'who', 'stood', 'rapt', 'attention', 'when', 'were', ""n't"", 'cheering', 'singing', 'along', 'playing', 'hit', 'hit', 'length', 'breadth', 'oeuvre', 'Get', 'DVD', 'understand', 'power', 'Elvis', 'live']",N/A
