Bonnie Franklins is by far the most fun and has you tapping super quick, whereas the other two simply teach a certain step, going over it and move on to another step.  Bonnie shows you a step, goes over it and puts those steps together pretty much right off the bat.  Much more enjoyable!!  She's incredibly personable and sweet.

I have dozens of dance/exercise videos (bellydance, tap, hip-hop, etc.)  The instructional format and Bonnie's teaching are exceptional - better than any other.  First she shows you what each of three routines look like.  Next she teaches each routine.  Her instructions are clear and perfectly paced.  Then she runs through the routine with you at a moderate tempo (this is the tempo I usually use to practice).  Last, she performs each routine again up to speed.  You come away with three great and basic tap dance routines that I am still practicing years after I learned them.  I can't say this about any other tape/dvd I have.  The routines progress in difficulty; the time step is exhausting and a great workout, even for dancers with some experience.",5,The Best Dance How-To Out There,1154304000,"07 31, 2006",2006,815,"['wish', 'would', 'put', 'out', 'more', 'superior', 'have', 'dozens', 'dance/exercise', 'videos', 'bellydance', 'tap', 'hip-hop', 'etc', 'instructional', 'format', 'Bonnie', 'teaching', 'are', 'exceptional', 'better', 'other', 'First', 'what', 'three', 'routines', 'look', 'Next', 'routine', 'instructions', 'are', 'clear', 'perfectly', 'paced', 'Then', 'routine', 'moderate', 'tempo', 'tempo', 'usually', 'use', 'practice', 'Last', 'routine', 'again', 'speed', 'come', 'away', 'three', 'great', 'basic', 'tap', 'dance', 'routines', 'am', 'still', 'practicing', 'years', 'learned', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'other', 'tape/dvd', 'have', 'routines', 'progress', 'difficulty', 'time', 'step', 'exhausting', 'great', 'workout', 'even', 'dancers', 'experience']",N/A

369816,A309B18FKBVCOA,6303335462,Patrick King,"[31, 31]","This is an excellent beginners tap dancing video. Bonnie goes through warm-up exercises and then teaches the basic steps you'll need to know in any tap routine. She teaches Brushes, shuffles, slaps, ball-change individually, then teaches you how to put them together in three famous routines: Waltz Clogg, Soft Shoe, and Time Step. These routines include famous steps like the Shim-Sham Shimmy, Shuffle Off To Buffalo, and the Cross Over. This video is full of challenging exercises and Bonnie goes over them carefully, slowly enough to pick them up, but a little faster than the beginner is prepared for. This is a perfect strategy, because by the time you've repeated the lesson often enough to get the step right, you can actually keep up with her. The trick here is to practice with this tape daily. If you're looking for a regimen to get your heart beating fast and provoke a little sweat, this video is perfect. I find I perspire a lot more when I have to put some intellectual effort into exercise, than when I'm just running, for example. Learning to tap dance was the way to go for me. I tried jumping rope, running, weight lifting, and they all bored me and I didn't feel they gave me much of a work out. It's very satisfying to execute the steps right. You get a little better every day, and you both see it and feel it. I expect even a seasoned dancer will appreciate and get a few pointers from this video.",5,"Perfect for beginners, challenging for the skilled",1166313600,"12 17, 2006",2006,1419,"['excellent', 'beginners', 'tap', 'dancing', 'video', 'Bonnie', 'warm-up', 'exercises', 'then', 'basic', 'steps', ""'ll"", 'need', 'know', 'tap', 'routine', 'Brushes', 'shuffles', 'slaps', 'ball-change', 'individually', 'then', 'how', 'put', 'together', 'three', 'famous', 'routines', 'Waltz', 'Clogg', 'Soft', 'Shoe', 'Time', 'Step', 'routines', 'include', 'famous', 'steps', 'Shim-Sham', 'Shimmy', 'Shuffle', 'Off', 'Buffalo', 'Cross', 'Over', 'video', 'full', 'challenging', 'exercises', 'Bonnie', 'carefully', 'slowly', 'enough', 'pick', 'up', 'little', 'faster', 'beginner', 'prepared', 'perfect', 'strategy', 'time', ""'ve"", 'repeated', 'lesson', 'often', 'enough', 'get', 'step', 'right', 'can', 'actually', 'keep', 'up', 'trick', 'here', 'practice', 'tape', 'daily', ""'re"", 'looking', 'regimen', 'get', 'heart', 'beating', 'fast', 'provoke', 'little', 'sweat', 'video', 'perfect', 'find', 'perspire', 'lot', 'more', 'when', 'have', 'put', 'intellectual', 'effort', 'exercise', 'when', ""'m"", 'just', 'running', 'example', 'Learning', 'tap', 'dance', 'was', 'way', 'go', 'tried', 'jumping', 'rope', 'running', 'weight', 'lifting', 'bored', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'gave', 'much', 'work', 'out', 'very', 'satisfying', 'execute', 'steps', 'right', 'get', 'little', 'better', 'day', 'see', 'feel', 'expect', 'even', 'seasoned', 'dancer', 'will', 'appreciate', 'get', 'few', 'pointers', 'video']",N/A
