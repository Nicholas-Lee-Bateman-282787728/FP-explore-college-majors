1504425,A28QLWDGTKXNHN,B005W2BWMG,Kenshin90991,"[0, 1]","This was one of the few shows that I did not watch when it came out and purchased. However my first exposure to Sekirei was on Funimation's Hulu channel while searching for something interesting to watch. Mind you I had no idea that this was one of those shows that loves to expose the top half of the female characters. That being said this is a show that is probably aimed for a more mature audience but that is something you probably already knew.The packageIf you read one of my reviews you'll know I'm very pleased with the way Funimation distributes its products. about 80% of my shows from them are DVD Blu Ray combo packs because thats just the way they sell them, and whats great is their very competitive pricing. 35 dollars for a very hefty yet slender case with more cd's then you'll know what to do with. Its very enticing and that is one of the reasons I find myself wanting to buy from Funimation. The quality is great although the menu's are a bit on the bland and on the boring side but it really doesn't matter, at least they send  you to a menu... (im looking at you Gundam Unicorn)however both you and I didn't buy or thought about buying this for the package alone. The plot itself is well..... in my opinion cannon fodder, especially in the first season. I found myself using the show as nothing more that a noise making tool, that's probably why I wasn't bothered by how much nudity is shown, You can get the idea of the plot within the first couple episodes of the first season and from there the rest really doesn't matter. That being said I can't say I didn't care about the characters or the show. No it was quite the opposite, originally I bought only the first season after the last couple episodes were no longer available on Hulu. Once I finished I found myself actually wanting more, I wanted to watch Pure Engagement, I wanted to know what happened to the cast and who else would be added into this wild situation. Even now that I have finished the two seasons I want to see a season 3. It is not high on my list of desires and even if it does come out I don't feel like ill end up spazing out like I did for other series but the show still manages to give me a warm feeling inside. Its not the best and it doesn't deserve any awards but the show has a overall positive vibe and that alone makes the plot worth it to me.The voice acting is oknothing special and nothing too horrible. The voices work and outside of that I can't think of any note worthy performances. Then again you paid such a low price that getting such a decent dub just adds value.In summary if you looking into this show be warned, this is not a show you want to show ""willy nilly,"" The plot isn't anything special and the copious amounts of nudity may make those watching wonder why you purchased it. The animation can sometimes look dated, ugly, or just bad even on Blu ray however, some how this show manages to do quite a few things right. First the price, second the positive vibe which lends itself well to background noise in your house, and thrid the overall story while not being something to write home about it manages to make you wonder and want to see the twist in the next season whether you are on season 1 or 2. Im not going to say go out and buy this, however if you're in the market to just find a new show check it out on Hulu or Funimation's channel. There are numerous places you can get an idea for what this show is about and if it is your cup of tea then you should consider paying the low entrance fee and keep it on your shelf.",4,The cover pretty much describes everything,1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,3557,"['was', 'one', 'few', 'shows', 'did', 'not', 'watch', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'purchased', 'However', 'first', 'exposure', 'Sekirei', 'was', 'Funimation', 'Hulu', 'channel', 'searching', 'something', 'interesting', 'watch', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'one', 'shows', 'expose', 'top', 'half', 'female', 'characters', 'being', 'said', 'show', 'probably', 'aimed', 'more', 'mature', 'audience', 'something', 'probably', 'already', 'knew.The', 'packageIf', 'read', 'one', 'reviews', ""'ll"", 'know', ""'m"", 'very', 'pleased', 'way', 'Funimation', 'products', '80', '%', 'shows', 'are', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'combo', 'packs', 'thats', 'just', 'way', 'sell', 'whats', 'great', 'very', 'competitive', 'pricing', '35', 'dollars', 'very', 'hefty', 'yet', 'slender', 'case', 'more', 'cd', 'then', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'very', 'enticing', 'one', 'reasons', 'find', 'wanting', 'buy', 'Funimation', 'quality', 'great', 'menu', 'are', 'bit', 'bland', 'boring', 'side', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'least', 'send', 'menu', 'im', 'looking', 'Gundam', 'Unicorn', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'thought', 'buying', 'package', 'alone', 'plot', 'well', '..', 'opinion', 'cannon', 'fodder', 'especially', 'first', 'season', 'found', 'using', 'show', 'nothing', 'more', 'noise', 'making', 'tool', 'probably', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'how', 'much', 'nudity', 'shown', 'can', 'get', 'idea', 'plot', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'rest', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'being', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'characters', 'show', 'No', 'was', 'quite', 'opposite', 'originally', 'bought', 'only', 'first', 'season', 'last', 'couple', 'episodes', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'available', 'Hulu', 'Once', 'finished', 'found', 'actually', 'wanting', 'more', 'wanted', 'watch', 'Pure', 'Engagement', 'wanted', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'cast', 'who', 'else', 'would', 'be', 'added', 'wild', 'situation', 'Even', 'now', 'have', 'finished', 'two', 'seasons', 'want', 'see', 'season', '3', 'not', 'high', 'list', 'desires', 'even', 'come', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'ill', 'end', 'up', 'spazing', 'did', 'other', 'series', 'show', 'still', 'give', 'warm', 'feeling', 'inside', 'not', 'best', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'awards', 'show', 'overall', 'positive', 'vibe', 'alone', 'plot', 'me.The', 'voice', 'acting', 'oknothing', 'special', 'nothing', 'too', 'horrible', 'voices', 'work', 'outside', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'note', 'worthy', 'performances', 'Then', 'again', 'paid', 'low', 'price', 'getting', 'decent', 'dub', 'just', 'value.In', 'summary', 'looking', 'show', 'be', 'warned', 'not', 'show', 'want', 'show', 'willy', 'nilly', 'plot', ""n't"", 'anything', 'special', 'copious', 'amounts', 'nudity', 'may', 'make', 'watching', 'wonder', 'why', 'purchased', 'animation', 'can', 'sometimes', 'look', 'dated', 'ugly', 'just', 'bad', 'even', 'Blu', 'ray', 'however', 'how', 'show', 'do', 'quite', 'few', 'things', 'right', 'First', 'price', 'second', 'positive', 'vibe', 'well', 'background', 'noise', 'house', 'thrid', 'overall', 'story', 'not', 'being', 'something', 'write', 'home', 'make', 'wonder', 'want', 'see', 'twist', 'next', 'season', 'are', 'season', '1', '2', 'Im', 'not', 'going', 'say', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'however', ""'re"", 'market', 'just', 'find', 'new', 'show', 'check', 'out', 'Hulu', 'Funimation', 'channel', 'are', 'numerous', 'places', 'can', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'show', 'about', 'cup', 'tea', 'then', 'should', 'consider', 'paying', 'low', 'entrance', 'fee', 'keep', 'shelf']",Sekirei 2: Pure Engagement Complete Season

You get more of the same with the over the top fan service, bulging bust lines and short skirts. However this time around we get more fights more story and more tension.

Sure, there is some fan service, but I wouldn't call it obnoxious. There was more nudity in season one. This season seemed to have more innuendo. I'm not a fan of seeing women objectified, and while the female characters all have over-sized chests, they each have well defined personalities. The girls are not submissive. They are all strong and full of femininity. If anything I think the moral of this anime is if you treat women with respect they will flock to you. The subject of how poorly other Sekirei are treated is often mentioned and shown. The male lead cares about the girls and their well being. He never objectifies them. He's a pretty good guy, and the girls like him for those reasons. The relationships are charming, and how they develop is just as important as the overall story.I really enjoyed the show. It's ridiculous and fun. But, also pleasant in a way that I felt echoed Tenchi Muyo. It has a heart. I watched the dubbed version. I thought the dub was well done. All the voices fit the characters. One funny sequence involving a phone call with Ku was awesome and spot on. I laughed pretty hard. I'd say if you are looking for a show that is light, fun, and don't mind the occasional fan service, pick up Sekirei. It has some tragic moments, but overall watching the show will leave you feeling good.

Funimation, at least, from what I have noticed. Forcing us to buy the dvd/blu ray combo pack. I had for a while entertained the idea of buying this particular set-the limited edition box pack, that is, buy it with someone else. I had seen it in a local store here in town, seen that it had what appeared to be two cases in the box, which I took as meaning one was dvd and the other was blue ray. Actually, the purple/gray box is just a cardcoard sleeve thing and not a case at all. So I guess it was just as well I was willing to splurge. My normal dvd set of the first season does at least fit in the empty space though so now I have it all together which was my ultimate goal all along.Other fun sounding sets that you will have to buy twice include Heaven's lost property, which season two is now available for pre-order, and cat planet cuties which is also a pre-order. All dvd/blu ray combo packs. Good sounding shows, fun, with lots of fan service from the sounds of them, but still.

That said if you did watch the first season you are most definately going to want to watch this one.Sekirei was a bit of a surprise for me. Despie how it is advertised as yet another fan fair, panty on the brain and not much else series there is a great deal more to the show then that. Yes the curse has been broken we finally have a fan service anime with a BRAIN! Underneath all of the nudity, panties and bouncing there are likable characters with real personalities not to mention a fair story line. Yes that's right this series actually has a purpose beyond fan service! But if you watched the first season you already know this,The second season here picks up a little while after the first and tasks off with a vengeance. A lot of the questions posed in the previous season are answered but enough is left out that they could make a third season if they so choose, it is even hinted at. Despite this there are enough loose threads tied up that you feel fine with it ending as it is.As with the previous season the animation is excellent, blending with 3d effects for some truly eye popping fight scenes and the voice acting top notch as well. Combined this with a decent, not excellent mind you, decent storyline and Sekirei is one of those rare series that while not one of the best anime ever made is most certainly among your favorites.In the end though the question is should I buy this season or series. Well let me be frank, it's $60 and the show is only 13 episodes long, about 5 hours. While fun, enjoyable and among my favorites that is just too high a price for me to recommend anyone to buy. I suggest waiting for the price to either drop or until they come out with a complete series box set with both seasons for the same price before buying this little gem.",4,It keeps getting better,1321747200,"11 20, 2011",2011,1907,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'expected', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'first', 'season', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'watch', 'season', 'said', 'did', 'watch', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'most', 'definately', 'going', 'want', 'watch', 'one.Sekirei', 'was', 'bit', 'surprise', 'Despie', 'how', 'advertised', 'yet', 'fan', 'fair', 'panty', 'brain', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'series', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'show', 'then', 'Yes', 'curse', 'been', 'broken', 'finally', 'have', 'fan', 'service', 'anime', 'BRAIN', 'Underneath', 'nudity', 'panties', 'bouncing', 'are', 'likable', 'characters', 'real', 'personalities', 'not', 'mention', 'fair', 'story', 'line', 'Yes', 'right', 'series', 'actually', 'purpose', 'fan', 'service', 'watched', 'first', 'season', 'already', 'know', 'second', 'season', 'here', 'up', 'little', 'while', 'first', 'tasks', 'off', 'vengeance', 'lot', 'questions', 'posed', 'previous', 'season', 'are', 'answered', 'enough', 'left', 'out', 'could', 'make', 'third', 'season', 'so', 'choose', 'even', 'hinted', 'are', 'enough', 'loose', 'threads', 'tied', 'up', 'feel', 'fine', 'ending', 'previous', 'season', 'animation', 'excellent', 'blending', '3d', 'effects', 'truly', 'eye', 'popping', 'fight', 'scenes', 'voice', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'as', 'well', 'Combined', 'decent', 'not', 'excellent', 'mind', 'decent', 'storyline', 'Sekirei', 'one', 'rare', 'series', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'anime', 'ever', 'made', 'most', 'certainly', 'favorites.In', 'end', 'question', 'should', 'buy', 'season', 'series', 'Well', 'let', 'be', 'frank', '60', 'show', 'only', '13', 'episodes', 'long', '5', 'hours', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'favorites', 'just', 'too', 'high', 'price', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'buy', 'suggest', 'waiting', 'price', 'drop', 'come', 'out', 'complete', 'series', 'box', 'set', 'seasons', 'same', 'price', 'buying', 'little', 'gem']",Sekirei 2: Pure Engagement Complete Season
