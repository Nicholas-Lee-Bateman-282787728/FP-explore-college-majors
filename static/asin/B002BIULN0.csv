1259708,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B002BIULN0,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[8, 8]","One Foot in the Grave was spread over 6 seasons, plus specials. This DVD provides only 2 specials, called ""The Christmas Specials"", but actually are not the typical Christmas special. They are two typical segments of the life of Victor and Margaret Meldrew, who face unbelievable mishap and buggery, throughout their suburban survival. 126 total minutes of laughs, mostly based upon the griping, badgering, growling, cynicism, verbal attacks by Victor, forced-retiree, who confronts head-on all of the unpleasant accidents and ridiculous atrocities of living after age 60.Quite funny and only unrealistic due to the mountain of distress fallen upon poor Victor, some of which is caused by his own miscalculations, misguided efforts, misunderstandings, and aging infirmity. Victor is played by Richard Wilson, a role he'll never live down. He's the Grumpiest of Old Men. Victor is the World champion of smart aleck retorts. He's King Curmudgeon. The British Bard of Barbs. Just when you give up hope for something more than cynicism from Victor, he provides an oasis bit of tenderness, a note of loving affection toward his wife.This 2 episode set is a good way to introduce to others or yourself the ""One Foot in the Grave"" series. It's like another fine British older couple series, ""As Time goes By"", also recommended, see my review. I'd recommend this set as a trial, but then you'll likely want to buy ""One Foot in the Grave: The Complete Collection"" which, by the way, includes this DVD specials disc, as well as 4 other Christmas specials, 36 episodes, and other extras.  Try ""As Time Goes By: Reunion Specials"" for a taste of that series prior to buying the complete series (again, see my review).One Foot in the Grave is a masterpiece of convoluted plots, woven together so smoothly, that one is forgotten in the movement into another, then, when least expecting it, some silly consequence occurs from the earlier plot activity. In the end, it's all drawn together, but often leaving one tiny aspect left to the viewer's imagination. It just makes it that much more fun. My wife and I are 60+, retired, and could relate.REPEATING, this DVD is NOT the complete set, but a delightful portion.I would NOT recommend this for CHILDREN.Adult humor, retiree humor, senior citizen humor, grumpy neighbor humor, side-splitting gags.",5,NOT THE COLLECTION-BUT 2 FUNNY SPECIALS,1264377600,"01 25, 2010",2010,2331,"['One', 'Foot', 'Grave', 'was', 'spread', '6', 'seasons', 'specials', 'DVD', 'only', '2', 'specials', 'called', 'Christmas', 'Specials', 'actually', 'are', 'not', 'typical', 'Christmas', 'special', 'are', 'two', 'typical', 'segments', 'life', 'Victor', 'Margaret', 'Meldrew', 'who', 'face', 'unbelievable', 'mishap', 'buggery', 'suburban', 'survival', '126', 'total', 'minutes', 'laughs', 'mostly', 'based', 'griping', 'badgering', 'growling', 'cynicism', 'verbal', 'attacks', 'Victor', 'forced-retiree', 'who', 'head-on', 'unpleasant', 'accidents', 'ridiculous', 'atrocities', 'living', 'age', '60.Quite', 'funny', 'only', 'unrealistic', 'due', 'mountain', 'distress', 'fallen', 'poor', 'Victor', 'caused', 'own', 'miscalculations', 'misguided', 'efforts', 'misunderstandings', 'aging', 'infirmity', 'Victor', 'played', 'Richard', 'Wilson', 'role', ""'ll"", 'never', 'live', 'down', 'Grumpiest', 'Old', 'Men', 'Victor', 'World', 'champion', 'smart', 'aleck', 'retorts', 'King', 'Curmudgeon', 'British', 'Bard', 'Barbs', 'Just', 'when', 'give', 'up', 'hope', 'something', 'more', 'cynicism', 'Victor', 'oasis', 'bit', 'tenderness', 'note', 'loving', 'affection', 'wife.This', '2', 'episode', 'set', 'good', 'way', 'introduce', 'others', 'One', 'Foot', 'Grave', 'series', 'fine', 'British', 'older', 'couple', 'series', 'Time', 'also', 'recommended', 'see', 'review', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'set', 'trial', 'then', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'want', 'buy', 'One', 'Foot', 'Grave', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'way', 'DVD', 'specials', 'disc', 'as', 'well', '4', 'other', 'Christmas', 'specials', '36', 'episodes', 'other', 'extras', 'Try', 'Time', 'Goes', 'Reunion', 'Specials', 'taste', 'series', 'prior', 'buying', 'complete', 'series', 'again', 'see', 'review', '.One', 'Foot', 'Grave', 'masterpiece', 'convoluted', 'plots', 'woven', 'together', 'so', 'smoothly', 'one', 'forgotten', 'movement', 'then', 'when', 'least', 'expecting', 'silly', 'consequence', 'earlier', 'plot', 'activity', 'end', 'drawn', 'together', 'often', 'leaving', 'one', 'tiny', 'aspect', 'left', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'just', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'wife', 'are', '60+', 'retired', 'could', 'relate.REPEATING', 'DVD', 'NOT', 'complete', 'set', 'delightful', 'portion.I', 'would', 'NOT', 'recommend', 'CHILDREN.Adult', 'humor', 'retiree', 'humor', 'senior', 'citizen', 'humor', 'grumpy', 'neighbor', 'humor', 'side-splitting', 'gags']",One Foot in the Grave: The Christmas Specials
