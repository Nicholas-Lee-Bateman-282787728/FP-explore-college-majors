A thriller? A drama? And intro-spective look a the human spirit? They are not sure. And because they are not sure, they add all these elements to the film, and leave us with the same feeling.. unsure.Brad Pitt is adorable. He seems to think that the movie is a light-hearted, happy romantic film, and he sticks with that. So Julia Robert's annoying clinginess and big mouth make it irritating. Pitt is dressed like a twenty year old, and although he may be gorgeous and look younger than he is, the fact that Roberts acts so superior and adult makes him seem like a misfit. And then it dawns on us.. he is SUPPOSED to be a misfit!The plot is just strange, and I realy can't describe it.

535023,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXRY,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I hadn't heard many good things about `The Mexican' and so I somewhat shelved the idea of ever even trying to watch it.  It had come on television multiple times and I just ignored the very thought of wasting two hours of my life on it.  And then, while carousing through my local video store I decided to actually read the back of the DVD case and I noticed the name of an actor whom I am eternal smitten with.  James Gandolfini.  Immediately I walked up to the checkout line and rented this film.  I can honestly say now, Gandolfini aside, `The Mexican' was a lot of fun.  I actually enjoyed this film far more than I ever expected.  The plot, while a bit forced and a little improbable, is full of twists and turns, but what makes the film so enjoyable and memorable at that is the onscreen chemistry, not between Pitts and Roberts as may be assumed, but between Roberts and Gandolfini, a pairing that was made in Hollywood heaven!Brad Pitt plays Jerry, a careless man who got caught up with a gangster due to a car accident and is now paying off his debt to the man by carrying out small errands.  His latest errand is to retrieve a beautifully crafted gun coined `the Mexican' that has about as much history to it as it does value.  The job gets botched though when Jerry gets carjacked and loses the gun.  As he tries to retrieve it himself his boss Arnold Margolese takes matters into his own hands by hiring a contract killer named Leroy to kidnap Jerry's girlfriend Samantha and hold her as hostage to trade out for the gun.  Jerry's friend Ted also ventures into Mexico to help Jerry retrieve the gun.Know that all the above information is subject to change, for this is an action/comedy with twists and turns in the plot that will alter the reality of my initial synopsis.  In other words, what I just wrote is what the film wants you to believe.What makes `The Mexican' such a fun and memorable film is the keen eye for character development.  Maybe no so much on the part of Jerry, but the characters of Samantha and Leroy really get fleshed out.  That is owed in large part to the wonderful performances by Julia Roberts and James Gandolfini.  As Samantha, Roberts is at her zany best.  I actually haven't seen her this much fun since her `Pretty Woman' days.  She was perfect in her role, hilarious and just orgasmically entertaining.  Speaking of orgasmic, James Gandolfini is just utter perfection here as Leroy.  His sensitive killer is a great spin off from his portrayal of Tony Soprano.  He plays Leroy a bit softer than he plays Tony, but the same sentimental elements are still there which work wonders for making Leroy a real person.  His relationship with Sam is so believable you almost want them to end up together (impossible for reasons you'll soon uncover) instead of Sam and Jerry.So, in conclusion, `The Mexican' is not a bad film at all.  Let go of any and all preconceived notions about this being a waste of time and give it a chance.  It's highly entertaining and will prove to be a great time for everyone involved.  Here's to hoping that Gandolfini gets more roles like this one now that his `Sopranos' career has ended.  He's a very talented actor who shines above the rest here and deserves to remain in the limelight.",4,"Truly unsuspected good time, a film that's fun, fresh, enjoyable and memorable...",1189382400,"09 10, 2007",2007,3258,"['had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'Mexican', 'so', 'somewhat', 'shelved', 'idea', 'ever', 'even', 'trying', 'watch', 'had', 'come', 'television', 'multiple', 'times', 'just', 'ignored', 'very', 'thought', 'wasting', 'two', 'hours', 'life', 'then', 'carousing', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'decided', 'actually', 'read', 'back', 'DVD', 'case', 'noticed', 'name', 'actor', 'whom', 'am', 'eternal', 'smitten', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'Immediately', 'walked', 'up', 'checkout', 'line', 'rented', 'film', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'now', 'Gandolfini', 'aside', 'Mexican', ""'"", 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'ever', 'expected', 'plot', 'bit', 'forced', 'little', 'improbable', 'full', 'twists', 'turns', 'film', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'memorable', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'not', 'Pitts', 'Roberts', 'may', 'be', 'assumed', 'Roberts', 'Gandolfini', 'pairing', 'was', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'heaven', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Jerry', 'careless', 'man', 'who', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'gangster', 'due', 'car', 'accident', 'now', 'paying', 'off', 'debt', 'man', 'carrying', 'out', 'small', 'errands', 'latest', 'errand', 'retrieve', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'gun', 'coined', 'Mexican', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'history', 'value', 'job', 'botched', 'when', 'Jerry', 'carjacked', 'gun', 'retrieve', 'boss', 'Arnold', 'Margolese', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'hiring', 'contract', 'killer', 'named', 'Leroy', 'kidnap', 'Jerry', 'girlfriend', 'Samantha', 'hold', 'as', 'hostage', 'trade', 'out', 'gun', 'Jerry', 'friend', 'Ted', 'also', 'ventures', 'Mexico', 'help', 'Jerry', 'retrieve', 'gun.Know', 'above', 'information', 'subject', 'change', 'action/comedy', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'will', 'alter', 'reality', 'initial', 'synopsis', 'other', 'words', 'what', 'just', 'wrote', 'what', 'film', 'believe.What', 'Mexican', 'such', 'fun', 'memorable', 'film', 'keen', 'eye', 'character', 'development', 'Maybe', 'so', 'much', 'part', 'Jerry', 'characters', 'Samantha', 'Leroy', 'really', 'get', 'fleshed', 'out', 'owed', 'large', 'part', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'Samantha', 'Roberts', 'zany', 'best', 'actually', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'much', 'fun', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'days', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'hilarious', 'just', 'orgasmically', 'entertaining', 'Speaking', 'orgasmic', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'just', 'utter', 'perfection', 'here', 'Leroy', 'sensitive', 'killer', 'great', 'spin', 'portrayal', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'Leroy', 'bit', 'softer', 'Tony', 'same', 'sentimental', 'elements', 'are', 'still', 'work', 'wonders', 'making', 'Leroy', 'real', 'person', 'relationship', 'Sam', 'so', 'believable', 'almost', 'want', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'impossible', 'reasons', ""'ll"", 'soon', 'uncover', 'instead', 'Sam', 'Jerry.So', 'conclusion', 'Mexican', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'Let', 'go', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'being', 'waste', 'time', 'give', 'chance', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'will', 'prove', 'be', 'great', 'time', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Here', 'hoping', 'Gandolfini', 'more', 'roles', 'one', 'now', 'Sopranos', 'career', 'ended', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'who', 'rest', 'here', 'remain', 'limelight']",The Mexican

On 9/12/65, Steve and partner Marty Allen were featured performers on anED SULLIVAN SHOWin which the Beatles played live to Ed's studio audience for the last time.THE MEXICAN is notable for a fine cast, plus an unusual dual storytelling technique that's done on two levels: modern/historic and modern/modern.At intervals we're treated to differing versions of the handcrafted 19th Century pistola's tale and legend, as recounted by several characters. These scenes are intentionally grainy and washed-out to give them an antique look. The first time it was ever used, the Mexican misfired, killing a bereaved bride-to-be who vengefully aimed it at her lover's murderer.In the modern story, when small-time hood Jerry Welbach (Pitt) is sent south of the border to retrieve both the ornate handgun and the grandson of a mob chief, his fianc&eacute;e, Samantha Barzel (Roberts), angrily calls it quits and storms off to Las Vegas. While there, she's kidnapped by thuggish 'Leroy' (Gandolfini), who turns out to have a sensitive side. Samantha becomes Leroy's confidante after he hooks up with a vacationing mailman.Back in Mexico, Jerry's stumbling from one hilarious disaster to the next causes his impatient boss to send some muscle after him.  Everything comes full circle with the Mexican once again in the hands of a bride-to-be. Samantha levels the pistol at her enemy and squeezes the trigger...This always interesting crime dramedy with a romantic legend subplot is eminently watchable and not just for fans of its three leads.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(6.0) The Mexican (2001) - Brad Pitt/Julia Roberts/James Gandolfini/Bob Balaban/Steve Rossi (uncredited: Gene Hackman)",4,"Jerry: ""I need a lift in your el truck-o to the next town-o!""",1298505600,"02 24, 2011",2011,1855,"['Vegas', 'M.C', 'seen', 'briefly', 'director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'THE', 'MEXICAN', 'Steve', 'Rossi', 'former', 'straightman/vocalist', 'Allen', 'Rossi', '9/12/65', 'Steve', 'partner', 'Marty', 'Allen', 'were', 'featured', 'performers', 'anED', 'SULLIVAN', 'SHOWin', 'Beatles', 'played', 'live', 'Ed', 'studio', 'audience', 'last', 'time.THE', 'MEXICAN', 'notable', 'fine', 'cast', 'unusual', 'dual', 'storytelling', 'technique', 'done', 'two', 'levels', 'modern/historic', 'modern/modern.At', 'intervals', ""'re"", 'treated', 'differing', 'versions', 'handcrafted', '19th', 'Century', 'pistola', 'tale', 'legend', 'recounted', 'several', 'characters', 'scenes', 'are', 'intentionally', 'grainy', 'washed-out', 'give', 'antique', 'look', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'ever', 'used', 'Mexican', 'misfired', 'killing', 'bereaved', 'bride-to-be', 'who', 'vengefully', 'aimed', 'lover', 'murderer.In', 'modern', 'story', 'when', 'small-time', 'hood', 'Jerry', 'Welbach', 'Pitt', 'sent', 'south', 'border', 'retrieve', 'ornate', 'handgun', 'grandson', 'mob', 'chief', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Samantha', 'Barzel', 'Roberts', 'angrily', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'there', 'kidnapped', 'thuggish', ""'Leroy"", 'Gandolfini', 'who', 'out', 'have', 'sensitive', 'side', 'Samantha', 'Leroy', 'confidante', 'up', 'vacationing', 'mailman.Back', 'Mexico', 'Jerry', 'stumbling', 'one', 'hilarious', 'disaster', 'next', 'impatient', 'boss', 'send', 'muscle', 'Everything', 'full', 'circle', 'Mexican', 'once', 'again', 'hands', 'bride-to-be', 'Samantha', 'levels', 'pistol', 'enemy', 'trigger', 'always', 'interesting', 'crime', 'dramedy', 'romantic', 'legend', 'subplot', 'eminently', 'watchable', 'not', 'just', 'fans', 'three', 'leads.Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'imdb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '6.0', 'Mexican', '2001', 'Brad', 'Pitt/Julia', 'Roberts/James', 'Gandolfini/Bob', 'Balaban/Steve', 'Rossi', 'uncredited', 'Gene', 'Hackman']",The Mexican

A disappointing factor for those hoping to watch these two lovelies together is the fact that they hardly share any screen time together. After a very shaky start of watching this odd couple fight over a trip to Las Vegas (which are terribly acted, revealing either too little rehearsing or actors not actually performing scenes on the set together), the film gets going when Pitt is forced by a group of gangsters to whom he owes a favour to retrieve a supposedly cursed handcrafted gun from Mexico. While he is gone Roberts is kidnapped by a hitman (James Gandolfini) who is possibly one of her boyfriend's enemies. Most of the film is funny, but some twists and turns will feel so odd as to not actually be quirky but actually be very uncomfortable.

James Gandolfini of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; is great to watch with Roberts too as they are terrific acting foils for one another. Thus, I have no complaints about the acting in this film. Where I have a BIG complaint though is with the script, which ambles along fine, if not brilliantly, for the first hour or so. However, it then gets so sidetracked with this ridiculous plot revolving around a Mexican pistol and the legends which surround it, that the film completely falls apart. That is the McGuffin of the whole film, btw, that Pitt, Roberts and Gandolfini are all on the road because this pistol must be recovered down in Mexico for some mobster. By the time Gene Hackmann (the mobster) comes on camera, you'd like to scream, because this whole add-on to the screenplay pushed you as the viewer beyond the point of no return. Hubby absolutely hated the film and would score it as one star. He joins several other Amazon reviewers here in their low views of this film.

His last job is to recover a rare pistol called &quot;The Mexican&quot; and bring back the holder (the bosses grandson) back to LA. However, he promised Samantha that he would take her Las Vegas and that his last job was his final obligation (since he bungled that THIS is his last job). They unofficially break up and go their separate ways. When Pitt disappears in Mexico and the grandson ends up dead, the mob send the ruthless Leroy to get Samantha and hold her hostage.Pro: Brad Pitt. Shows effortless charm in a role that he plays with natural ease. Much more at home playing Jerry, than in more serious roles in movies like &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot;, &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; and &quot;Devil's Own&quot;.Pro: James Gandolfini, Gives his character of Leroy 3 dimensions. Can be sweetly sensitive in one sentence and then ruthlessly coldfaced in the next. Lesser actors would have had Leroy turn into a pile of sentimental mush by the second act.Pro: Julia Roberts. She plays Samantha with a great deal of understanding and kindness in her scenes with James Gandolfini and they have a great deal of chemistry together.Pro: Edgy plotline. This movie is not your typical &quot;chick-flick&quot;. It has violence, profanity (and a cool legend) that most action lovers would like.Con: Julia Roberts. She is annoying and has little chemistry with Brad Pitt when they are together. She also continues to cross the line of sweet/saccherine in this movie. You don't have to give your devilishly beautiful smile to win us over Julia.Con: While jokes are funny at first, it becomes lame and repetitive. Several jokes in regards to 1. A Dog 2. Traffic Light and 3. Mexican Rentals are shown to us over and over again.Con: Directing. It is unfocused and lack of editing made the movie seem too long.

One gets the impression that there was little time allotted for revisions and numerous takes.  I kept getting the impression, perhaps unfairly, that the actors were more concerned with their next project.  The chemistry between Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts did not remind one of Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn.  Also, they are getting too old to play the parts of individuals who act as if they are still in their late twenties.Jerry (Pitt) is a bumbling petty criminal who cannot stay out of trouble. His boss portrayed by the always delightful Bob Balaban orders Jerry to enter Mexico to retrieve a pistol named ""The Mexican.""  This is no ordinary gun, and it might even be cursed.  The story line depends on a unflattering depiction of Mexican life that borders on caricature.  Every clich&eacute; and demeaning stereotype is employed to push the story along. Samantha (Roberts) comes unglued by Jerry's new job assignment.  This results in a series of marginally comical events involving a gay professional assassin named Leroy (James Gandolfini).  The two of them engage in unrelenting psychobabble and overdone bathroom humor.  However,  I must concede that these scenes somewhat save the movie.  ""The Mexican""  is too long by about twenty minutes.  Gene Hackman has a cameo role at the very end portraying a criminal leader.  He adds virtually nothing to the plot, and Hackman reads his lines as if he only had one day of preparation.  Added star power is not sufficient to address a lackluster production.  Unfortunately, the powers that be in Hollywood have yet to learn this lesson.

535042,A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8,B00003CXRY,Desmond Chan,"[1, 1]","For those who anticipated the two mega stalwarts Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts to dazzle with a modern day romance, THE MEXICAN comes as an awkward surprise. That's not to say the oddball romance is without its merits - in fact the quirkiness and unpredictible goofy plot manages to enhance the characters, each with their own encounters and reunites for a twist in the plot towards the end.Director Gore Verbinski (Mousehunt) is courageous in choosing this plot - and the co-stars has never been more compatible. Though Pitt and Roberts do not share much screen time together, it's a journey they seemed to enjoy. Pitts plays Jerry who is on his last &quot;delivery&quot; trip for the mafia - and little does he know about the pistol he is handling is much sought after. It leads to mayhem and even drags Sam (Roberts) to be kidnapped by Winston. There is humour along the way as each character apprehends their fate - Roberts gets to confirm her love for Jerry and befriends an affectionate Winston for a killer. It is unpredictibly exhilarating as each character faces tacky yet hilarious situations - and the ending glosses the uneven setting and plot with Gene Hackman making a cameo appearance.THE MEXICAN may not be your typical romance, yet the fun that Roberts and Pitts share is so infectious and bubbly that you shouldn't have any misgivings. The middle part of the movie sags a little but the ultimate piece of work is gratifyingly uplifting. It is though - a movie that you either like it or hate it to the core - ambivalence gives THE MEXICAN a 3.5 stars rating.",4,THE MEXICAN is gratifyingly uplifting,999302400,"09 1, 2001",2001,1574,"['who', 'anticipated', 'two', 'mega', 'stalwarts', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'dazzle', 'modern', 'day', 'romance', 'THE', 'MEXICAN', 'awkward', 'surprise', 'not', 'say', 'oddball', 'romance', 'merits', 'fact', 'quirkiness', 'unpredictible', 'goofy', 'plot', 'manages', 'enhance', 'characters', 'own', 'encounters', 'reunites', 'twist', 'plot', 'end.Director', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'Mousehunt', 'courageous', 'choosing', 'plot', 'co-stars', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'compatible', 'Pitt', 'Roberts', 'do', 'not', 'share', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'together', 'journey', 'seemed', 'enjoy', 'Pitts', 'Jerry', 'who', 'last', 'quot', 'delivery', 'quot', 'trip', 'mafia', 'little', 'know', 'pistol', 'handling', 'much', 'sought', 'mayhem', 'even', 'drags', 'Sam', 'Roberts', 'be', 'kidnapped', 'Winston', 'humour', 'way', 'character', 'fate', 'Roberts', 'confirm', 'love', 'Jerry', 'affectionate', 'Winston', 'killer', 'unpredictibly', 'exhilarating', 'character', 'tacky', 'yet', 'hilarious', 'situations', 'ending', 'uneven', 'setting', 'plot', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'making', 'cameo', 'MEXICAN', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'typical', 'romance', 'fun', 'Roberts', 'Pitts', 'share', 'so', 'infectious', 'bubbly', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'misgivings', 'middle', 'part', 'movie', 'little', 'ultimate', 'piece', 'work', 'gratifyingly', 'uplifting', 'movie', 'either', 'hate', 'core', 'ambivalence', 'THE', 'MEXICAN', '3.5', 'stars', 'rating']",The Mexican
535043,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00003CXRY,D. Litton,"[2, 3]","You may be disappointed to know that Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts don't share a lot of screen time in &quot;The Mexican,&quot; part romantic comedy, part man hunt comedy thriller. Having said that, what there is of the two is plenty of fun, and for the most part, so is the rest of the film. It tends to be slow in the beginning, but it ends with a lot of heart and charm, and quickly becomes an above average movie.Pitt stars as Jerry, who is called upon by his mob boss to complete one last mission that involves retrieving a gun from Mexico and bringing it back to the states. This means disappointment for his girlfriend, Samantha, played by Roberts, who dumps him and heads for Las Vegas once he is on his way to Mexico. Once he finds the gun, he soon learns its precious history and value, and soon becomes the target of various hit men and greedy bosses.This beginning isn't all that interesting, and may discourage some from paying attention to the film's later moments. There are light moments of comedy, including a perfectly funny argument between Jerry and Samantha, but once he is on his way to Mexico, things begin to get sluggish.However, once Samantha becomes a hostage held by hit man Leroy (James Gandolfini of HBO's &quot;The Sopranos&quot;), things begin to get interesting, and funnier than before. Sam and Leroy develop a bond that is completely offbeat, considering their relationship as kidnapper and hostage, yet his quiet homosexuality provides some light touches of comedic brilliance that are sure to induce laughter.Things in Mexico begin to get interesting as well, once Jerry begins putting the pieces together about who is actually on his side, and who's out to get him. This provides for a few good action scenes, and a few controversial scenes as well. One scene in particular involves Jerry's discovery about Leroy's real agenda, a reversal twist that comes as more of a disappointment than a welcomed surprise, considering how much we have come to like and care for his character.One very smart thing about &quot;The Mexican&quot; is its ability to play by the rules, giving us a mystery plot that is not too complex, and ties all of its loose ends together when the ending draws near. You won't have to think to hard about what's going on, as most of the characters are given exposition dialogue to explain such things as the history of the gun, and some of the twists involving hit men and mob bosses. Those seeking a highly energized mystery thriller may find this story a bit too juvenile, while those looking for something that won't insult their intelligence will be delighted.Kudos and more just praise goes to the cast, all of whom give some of the greatest performances in a comedy this year. Pitt proves his ability to do comedy as Jerry, and his action sequences are top of the line. Roberts is back in fine form, her best performance since &quot;Erin Brockovich;&quot; if she can't carry off the phrase &quot;I can't find my Kotex cards or my credit pads,&quot; then no other actress can. She shares a nice chemistry with Pitt, as well as with Gandolfini, who gives one of the greatest performances of the year as Leroy.

There were a few breaks in the tedium of her performance; just the briefest reminder of her  very real beauty and talent.

We even thought ourselves brave last time when we actually went a few miles into Tijuana to take a closer look at the country.Pity then, poor Brad Pitt, who not only has to enter the country, but rent a car and go into the middle of nowhere (at least to we gringos), to pick up an old pistol (named &quot;The Mexican) that his underworld bosses want.  He goes far beyond anything that could be called a tourist destination, and has to enter several hostile environments to achieve his mission.  The fact that it doesn't go smoothly provides the basic premise of the story.I say basic premise, but not the complete story.  As a review is meant to be some sort of consumer advice, the big one here is that Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt are rarely on the screen together, and when they are, they are usually arguing.  Most of the ads for this film have directed you to think this, and it's not the case.But that doesn't make it a bad movie.  First, we get to see a lot of Mexico that most citizens of this country don't get to see.  Yes, there is a lot of poverty, and yes, a lot of it is dirty (by our standards), but people still live there and make it their home.  It is alternately funny, scary, and revealing to see how Pitt navigates through the country trying to solve his problems.But the big reason to see the movie is the interraction between Julia Roberts and her main kidnapper (more on this later), James Gandolfini.  What is first an obviously hostile situation turns into a strong bond that develops as the characters get to know each other.  Not a romantic bond in any way, but what turns out to be a genuine friendship that becomes potentially tragic when they both realize what has to happen to her if everything doesn't work out right.  For this, the movie is worth seeing.So why only three stars?  Well, I take a little off because I hate when movies market themselves as something they are not, and I've already mentioned the lack of Pitt-Roberts screen time.  Also, we have not one, but two kidnappers, and what their individual roles are is not always made clear.  While flashbacks to the origin of the gun are very interesting, they are also confusing/conflicting, and I wasn't exactly satisfied that the final resting place for the gun was that big of a deal for everything that people went through to get it.But there is enough in a lot of ways to make it definately worth a look.",3,Good for reasons you might not think,1020038400,"04 29, 2002",2002,2609,"['have', 'driven', 'Mexico', 'serveral', 'times', 'have', 'thought', 'even', 'rebel', 'bypassing', 'temporary', 'insurance', 'hawkers', 'bravely', 'going', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'car', 'family', 'firmly', 'tow', 'even', 'thought', 'ourselves', 'brave', 'last', 'time', 'when', 'actually', 'went', 'few', 'miles', 'Tijuana', 'take', 'closer', 'look', 'country.Pity', 'then', 'poor', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'enter', 'country', 'rent', 'car', 'go', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'least', 'gringos', 'pick', 'up', 'old', 'pistol', 'named', 'quot', 'Mexican', 'underworld', 'bosses', 'want', 'far', 'anything', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'tourist', 'destination', 'enter', 'several', 'hostile', 'environments', 'achieve', 'mission', 'fact', ""n't"", 'go', 'smoothly', 'basic', 'premise', 'story.I', 'say', 'basic', 'premise', 'not', 'complete', 'story', 'review', 'meant', 'be', 'sort', 'consumer', 'advice', 'big', 'one', 'here', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'are', 'rarely', 'screen', 'together', 'when', 'are', 'are', 'usually', 'arguing', 'Most', 'ads', 'film', 'have', 'directed', 'think', 'not', 'case.But', ""n't"", 'make', 'bad', 'movie', 'First', 'get', 'see', 'lot', 'Mexico', 'most', 'citizens', 'country', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'Yes', 'lot', 'poverty', 'yes', 'lot', 'dirty', 'standards', 'people', 'still', 'live', 'there', 'make', 'home', 'alternately', 'funny', 'scary', 'revealing', 'see', 'how', 'Pitt', 'country', 'trying', 'solve', 'problems.But', 'big', 'reason', 'see', 'movie', 'interraction', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'main', 'kidnapper', 'more', 'later', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'What', 'first', 'obviously', 'hostile', 'situation', 'strong', 'bond', 'characters', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'Not', 'romantic', 'bond', 'way', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'genuine', 'friendship', 'potentially', 'tragic', 'when', 'realize', 'happen', 'everything', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'right', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing.So', 'why', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'Well', 'take', 'little', 'hate', 'when', 'movies', 'market', 'something', 'are', 'not', ""'ve"", 'already', 'mentioned', 'lack', 'Pitt-Roberts', 'screen', 'time', 'Also', 'have', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'kidnappers', 'what', 'individual', 'roles', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'made', 'clear', 'flashbacks', 'origin', 'gun', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'are', 'also', 'confusing/conflicting', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'satisfied', 'final', 'resting', 'place', 'gun', 'was', 'big', 'deal', 'everything', 'people', 'went', 'get', 'it.But', 'enough', 'lot', 'ways', 'make', 'definately', 'look']",The Mexican

Well, now we have our answer.  This is a B movie screenplay that grossed close to $70 million, a stunning tribute to star power.The story is a quirky tale about a loser named Jerry (Brad Pitt) and his neurotic girlfriend Samantha (Julia Robert) and his misadventure procuring a legendary Mexican pistol that is believed to be cursed.  While he is on this mission from the mob, his girlfriend is taken hostage by Leroy (James Gandolfini), a gay hit man who is holding her to assure that Jerry doesn't run off with the gun and sell it.  The characters aren't the only ones that need therapy, since the film has an identity crisis of its own.  Is it a light hearted comedy or a blood and guts action flick?  The answer is both, but neither is done well.There are a few good skits in the film, mostly between Gandolfini and Roberts.  The slapstick is mostly lame due to the fact that Brad Pitt, gorgeous though he might be, is no comedian.This is an opportunity for the three leads to spread their wings a bit, playing characters that take them to unaccustomed territory.  Gandolfini gives us his standard mob characterization, but this time with a twist.  Beneath that murderous exterior, he is ultra sensitive and gay, and he uses his hostage to vent all his loneliness and frustration.  Gandolfini continues to prove that he is one of the best mob toughs ever, gay or straight, with a droll performance that produces some of the best laughs in the film.  Yet, of the three, his performance strayed the least from his comfort zone.Julia Roberts gets a chance to extend her already awesome comedic talents with this part.  She steals the show with her portrayal of the temperamental girlfriend from Hades, who is constantly spouting west coast psychobabble and blaming everyone else for her problems.  Her comedic screen chemistry with Gandolfini is fabulous as the two lob grenades at one another, throwing in subtle physical comedy without missing a beat.Brad Pitt is completely out of his element in this film.  I admire his courage in taking a role so far removed from his normal type.  Pitt is used to playing the hardened rebel, always smart, resourceful and independent.  This role is the antithesis of that.  Here he plays a dim-witted, bumbling, henpecked loser and he is all thumbs trying to slip into his character's skin.Overall, the film is far less than the sum of its parts.  This is likely to be a big disappointment for Pitt fans, but a pleasant surprise for Roberts and Gandolfini fans.  To the non fans out there that are just looking for a good story, this won't provide much satisfaction.

He was sensational as the young , sensitive vampire in Interview With A Vampire ,schokingly human in Seven , cool and funny in Fight Club . On the other hand he was truly awfull as clumsy , german climber in Seven Years In Thibet , one-dimensional and boring as the horny reaper in Meet Joe Black. Here he gives one of his worst perfomances yet , one of these perfomances ex-fashion models give in order to start a movie career . He fails to be even as half as believable as J.Galdofini is in the film's central supporting role . The thing is there are many young actors who could play this part much better than Pitt like , for example Liev Schreiber or even Ben Chaplin . And it's really unfair that gifted guys like that never get the chance to play opposite Roberts and get known by a wider audience . Despite all that ,The Mexican is not as depthless as it's trailer implies .Sporadically it's touching and at times suprisingly serious .It's plot has one or two twists which merely work and the photography travels you to the lazy beautiness of Mexico.

535056,A1Y1YRO74S6ELA,B00003CXRY,"GreatWriterChrisJames ""ChrisJames""","[4, 4]","Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts star in this dark comedy/low budget action movie. ''The Mexican'' is about a guy named Jerry (Pitt) who works for a crime boss. One day the crime boss, asks Jerry for one last ''job'' before Jerry decides to quit working for him and pay of his debts. The ''job'' though isn't as easy as Jerry thinks it is. He is asked to find a rare gun that is worth alot of money in Mexico.Jerry's girlfriend , a nieve and spoiled brat named Samantha (Roberts fits the role perfectly ) reacts to Jerry last job like a bat out of hell. She immediately tells Jerry that if he goes to this job that she will never take him back, and to not both coming to her. The character of Samantha is as shallow and mean as a woman can get, I almost get shivers down my spine when I think that women like Samantha exist, because they aren't worth fighting for.What Samantha doesn't realize is that Jerry is doing this job for her out of love. Jerry wants to pay his debts , and to pay of this debts requires doing this job in Mexico.Pitt while not being the charasmatic actor, does at least add some depth and character to Jerry.Anyhow once Jerry arrives in Mexico (a pretty dangerous place in some areas, but enjoyable in others) meets his contact who is going to give the rare gun to him.However, things go horribly wrong when the contact Jerry is with literally diesin front of him during a midnight celebration in Mexico. Jerry at first does not know the guy is dead, until he notices the bloody headshot on the car seat where he places the body in!!! Uggh.This is only the start of a bad situation for Jerry. Once Jerry's crime boss finds out that he has fowled things up (although it's not his fault this guy is dead) sends in a psychopath killer named Leroy (James Gandolfini ) to hold his girlfriend Sam as hostage, while Jerry tries to come back to his boss with the antique gun.One of the big problems the Mexican is the load of unlikeable characters in thefilm. Brad Pitt's character of Jerry is probably the only somewhat likeable character in the film. Julia Roberts (again in her usual uncharasmatic self) as Sam, doesn't reallyshow any love or compassion only up to the point where she herself becomes involved in Jerry's situation. She only really cares about herself.Then there's Gandolifini's character who can be best characterized as self hypocriting homosexual, hitman. which in fact he is if you watch the whole film. Gandolfini is best known for playing the paranoid , lovable, and evil Tony Soprano in the Sopranos but his role in that overrated, and his role in this film is forgettable.The Mexican is not a total waste of a film, although much of it is.I loved the twists in the film that the Mexican's in the film, from the villages to the cops were smarter than the dumb gringo (Jerry) who comes to look for the ancient gun for his boss. In fact, the Mexican's gave me such a good laugh, that I thought they were probably the best actors in the film. Every stereotype that Jerry and his white crime buddies put on them is eventually thrown back in their face with big laughs.That's all I can say, I won't spoil it though by going into the exact dialogue. The film also has a couple of good twists in the middle, and near the end. However, the Mexican though has so many problems with it, that keep it from leaving a lasting impression and making it a likeable film that I can't recommend buying.Renting it though is a different matter, you'll probably get some good laughs from it like I did, but that's it.As Roger Ebert would say ''Two Thumbs Down'' but give it a viewing however don't expect to be blown away by this low budget film because you wont.",2,The Mexican a very flawed film with Pitt and Roberts,1088640000,"07 1, 2004",2004,3680,"['Brad', 'Pitt', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'star', 'dark', 'comedy/low', 'budget', 'action', 'movie', 'Mexican', 'guy', 'named', 'Jerry', 'Pitt', 'who', 'crime', 'boss', 'One', 'day', 'crime', 'boss', 'Jerry', 'one', 'last', 'job', 'Jerry', 'quit', 'working', 'pay', 'debts', 'job', 'though', ""n't"", 'as', 'easy', 'Jerry', 'asked', 'find', 'rare', 'gun', 'worth', 'alot', 'money', 'Mexico.Jerry', 'girlfriend', 'nieve', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'named', 'Samantha', 'Roberts', 'role', 'perfectly', 'Jerry', 'last', 'job', 'bat', 'hell', 'immediately', 'Jerry', 'job', 'will', 'never', 'take', 'back', 'not', 'coming', 'character', 'Samantha', 'shallow', 'mean', 'woman', 'can', 'get', 'almost', 'get', 'shivers', 'down', 'spine', 'when', 'think', 'women', 'Samantha', 'exist', 'are', ""n't"", 'worth', 'fighting', 'for.What', 'Samantha', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Jerry', 'doing', 'job', 'out', 'love', 'Jerry', 'pay', 'debts', 'pay', 'debts', 'doing', 'job', 'Mexico.Pitt', 'not', 'being', 'charasmatic', 'actor', 'least', 'add', 'depth', 'character', 'Jerry.Anyhow', 'once', 'Jerry', 'Mexico', 'pretty', 'dangerous', 'place', 'areas', 'enjoyable', 'others', 'contact', 'who', 'going', 'give', 'rare', 'gun', 'him.However', 'things', 'go', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'when', 'contact', 'Jerry', 'literally', 'diesin', 'front', 'midnight', 'celebration', 'Mexico', 'Jerry', 'first', 'not', 'know', 'guy', 'dead', 'bloody', 'headshot', 'car', 'seat', 'where', 'body', 'Uggh.This', 'only', 'start', 'bad', 'situation', 'Jerry', 'Once', 'Jerry', 'crime', 'boss', 'out', 'fowled', 'things', 'up', 'not', 'fault', 'guy', 'dead', 'psychopath', 'killer', 'named', 'Leroy', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'hold', 'girlfriend', 'Sam', 'hostage', 'Jerry', 'come', 'back', 'boss', 'antique', 'gun.One', 'big', 'problems', 'Mexican', 'load', 'unlikeable', 'characters', 'thefilm', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'character', 'Jerry', 'probably', 'only', 'somewhat', 'likeable', 'character', 'film', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'again', 'usual', 'uncharasmatic', 'self', 'Sam', ""n't"", 'reallyshow', 'love', 'compassion', 'only', 'up', 'point', 'where', 'involved', 'Jerry', 'situation', 'only', 'really', 'herself.Then', 'Gandolifini', 'character', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'best', 'characterized', 'self', 'hypocriting', 'homosexual', 'hitman', 'fact', 'watch', 'whole', 'film', 'Gandolfini', 'best', 'known', 'playing', 'paranoid', 'lovable', 'evil', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'Sopranos', 'role', 'overrated', 'role', 'film', 'forgettable.The', 'Mexican', 'not', 'total', 'waste', 'film', 'much', 'loved', 'twists', 'film', 'Mexican', 'film', 'villages', 'cops', 'were', 'smarter', 'dumb', 'gringo', 'Jerry', 'who', 'look', 'ancient', 'gun', 'boss', 'fact', 'Mexican', 'gave', 'such', 'good', 'laugh', 'thought', 'were', 'probably', 'best', 'actors', 'film', 'stereotype', 'Jerry', 'white', 'crime', 'buddies', 'put', 'eventually', 'thrown', 'back', 'face', 'big', 'laughs.That', 'can', 'say', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'going', 'exact', 'dialogue', 'film', 'also', 'couple', 'good', 'twists', 'middle', 'end', 'However', 'Mexican', 'though', 'so', 'many', 'problems', 'keep', 'leaving', 'lasting', 'impression', 'making', 'likeable', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'buying.Renting', 'different', 'matter', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'get', 'good', 'laughs', 'did', 'it.As', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'would', 'say', 'Two', 'Thumbs', 'Down', 'give', 'viewing', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'wont']",The Mexican

Instead, they have made a quaint, interesting and entertaining film where the supporting characters can be more interesting than the super-star mains.It has been said before but the most interesting part of this movie is how the director has managed to get two of the biggest names in Hollywood, have them apart for three quarters of the movie and have it all work out for the better. This was an excellent choice to make. With this happening the film is no longer supremely star driven and it can focus more on its plot and other characters instead of Robert's and Pitt's pretty faces. It was a risk and I think the film may have suffered financially because of it (this was not a huge film for either stars) but critically the film has been praised.Both Pitt and Roberts are excellent together and apart. Pitt is enjoyable to watch as his character squirms through all of the mishaps that occur. Roberts is delightful, as usual, and it was nice to see her in a more down-to-earth role. Both stars, however, are completely blown off of the screen by James Gandolfini's fantastic portrayal as a hitman sent to keep tabs on Roberts' character. The scenes with him are the best in the film and all of his verbal exchanges with Robert's are great. The two of them seem to work off of one another and they raise simple scenes to a higher level with genuine non-sexual, on-screen chemistry.The directing is not flashy and that fits the story and the feel of the film very well. The decision to keep the stars apart was a brilliant move and it is what made the film great. The director appeared to know exactly what part of the story to focus on at each moment and this made a potentially confusing film easy to follow. He has a strong sense of story and an obvious talent.A wonderful, fairly light film that is a hidden gem amongst many of the star-powered films out there. This film reminds us why these two are stars in the first place: they are great actors. The film is funny and exciting, at times romantic and highly recommended.

535077,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXRY,Matthew Horner,"[1, 2]","Many movie goers (and not a few critics) were perplexed by The Mexican. People don't like to be perplexed, and much of the word of mouth, as well as the reviews, were far from kind. I happened to really like this movie in many ways, but I tend not to categorize either movies or actors as much as others do. I think the best way to enjoy the movie is to forget that it brings the first pairing of super paid superstars Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts. Try, if you can, to think of it as an independent film that just happens to star them. This might be difficult because, even though their bodies of work suggest otherwise, both Pitt and Roberts have reputations which make people want to see them in big budget formula flicks. So, forget the thoughts of a bubbly romance, ala Notting Hill. Here, not only are they acting in a rather dark little comedy, they are on screen together only four or five times. These scenes are memorable, however, and, considering how combative the characters are to each other, their being together through the whole movie would have proven to be too much.Jerry and Samantha [Pitt and Roberts] have lived together for five years. They love each other, but they have issues which cause them to fight a lot. Samantha is into trendy psychobabble about relationships which drives Jerry crazy. Jerry was the party at fault in a traffic accident a few years back that caused a big mobster to be sent to prison. He's has been forced to work for the man's gang ever since. Jerry and Sam are planning to move to Las Vegas where Sam thinks she will find happiness by first becoming a waitress and then a dealer at a casino. When the mob unexpectedly forces Jerry to take one more job because he screwed up the last one, Sam revolts and throws him out. He must go to Mexico to retrieve a priceless antique pistol which is 'The Mexican' of the movie's title. Jerry never has had much luck or common sense, and everything imaginable goes wrong south of the border. Meanwhile, Sam leaves for Vegas alone. En route, she is kidnapped by Leroy [James Gandolfini], who claims he is holding her hostage to ensure Jerry's bringing the pistol back. Sam is no ordinary victim, as it turns out, and Leroy is about the most interesting kidnapper you'll ever meet. Back in Mexico, Jerry fumbles along and soon comes to believe the stories about the pistol's being cursed are the truth.Gandolfini, who is best known for his role on HBO's The Sopranos, nearly steals the show as Leroy. He plays his role so well that you could say the movie has three stars. Pitt and Roberts are great, making the best of roles that are a bit difficult because these characters are sometimes hard to relate to. Sam can be awfully pushy and shrill, and Jerry is not working with a full deck. Actors of lesser skills would have lost any empathy with the audience, but Pitt and Roberts pull it off.I have just one complaint about The Mexican. It's a comedy with a mean streak in it. Certain scenes that I assume are meant to be humorous seem a little cold blooded to me. I have seen this same technique in several movies recently. It's okay with me if a movie is callous, but such an attitude doesn't always equal funny. Still, there are enough laughs and witty lines to make it worth you while.",4,"Quirk, offbeat movie not typical superstar material",1016064000,"03 14, 2002",2002,3275,"['Many', 'movie', 'goers', 'not', 'few', 'critics', 'were', 'perplexed', 'Mexican', 'People', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'be', 'perplexed', 'much', 'word', 'mouth', 'as', 'well', 'reviews', 'were', 'far', 'kind', 'happened', 'really', 'like', 'movie', 'many', 'ways', 'tend', 'not', 'categorize', 'movies', 'actors', 'as', 'much', 'others', 'do', 'think', 'best', 'way', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'forget', 'first', 'pairing', 'super', 'paid', 'superstars', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Try', 'can', 'think', 'independent', 'film', 'just', 'star', 'might', 'be', 'difficult', 'even', 'bodies', 'work', 'suggest', 'otherwise', 'Pitt', 'Roberts', 'have', 'reputations', 'make', 'people', 'want', 'see', 'big', 'budget', 'formula', 'flicks', 'So', 'forget', 'thoughts', 'bubbly', 'romance', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'Here', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'acting', 'rather', 'dark', 'little', 'comedy', 'are', 'screen', 'together', 'only', 'four', 'five', 'times', 'scenes', 'are', 'memorable', 'however', 'considering', 'how', 'combative', 'characters', 'are', 'other', 'being', 'together', 'whole', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'proven', 'be', 'too', 'much.Jerry', 'Samantha', '[', 'Pitt', 'Roberts', ']', 'have', 'lived', 'together', 'five', 'years', 'love', 'other', 'have', 'issues', 'cause', 'fight', 'lot', 'Samantha', 'trendy', 'psychobabble', 'relationships', 'Jerry', 'crazy', 'Jerry', 'was', 'party', 'fault', 'traffic', 'accident', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'caused', 'big', 'mobster', 'be', 'sent', 'prison', 'been', 'forced', 'work', 'man', 'gang', 'ever', 'Jerry', 'Sam', 'are', 'planning', 'move', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'where', 'Sam', 'will', 'find', 'happiness', 'first', 'becoming', 'waitress', 'then', 'dealer', 'casino', 'When', 'mob', 'unexpectedly', 'Jerry', 'take', 'one', 'more', 'job', 'screwed', 'up', 'last', 'one', 'Sam', 'revolts', 'out', 'must', 'go', 'Mexico', 'retrieve', 'priceless', 'antique', 'pistol', ""'The"", 'Mexican', 'movie', 'title', 'Jerry', 'never', 'had', 'much', 'luck', 'common', 'sense', 'everything', 'imaginable', 'wrong', 'south', 'border', 'Meanwhile', 'Sam', 'Vegas', 'alone', 'En', 'route', 'kidnapped', 'Leroy', '[', 'James', 'Gandolfini', ']', 'who', 'holding', 'hostage', 'ensure', 'Jerry', 'bringing', 'pistol', 'back', 'Sam', 'ordinary', 'victim', 'out', 'Leroy', 'most', 'interesting', 'kidnapper', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'meet', 'Back', 'Mexico', 'Jerry', 'along', 'soon', 'believe', 'stories', 'pistol', 'being', 'cursed', 'are', 'truth.Gandolfini', 'who', 'best', 'known', 'role', 'HBO', 'Sopranos', 'nearly', 'show', 'Leroy', 'role', 'so', 'well', 'could', 'say', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'Pitt', 'Roberts', 'are', 'great', 'making', 'best', 'roles', 'are', 'bit', 'difficult', 'characters', 'are', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'relate', 'Sam', 'can', 'be', 'awfully', 'pushy', 'shrill', 'Jerry', 'not', 'working', 'full', 'deck', 'Actors', 'lesser', 'skills', 'would', 'have', 'lost', 'empathy', 'audience', 'Pitt', 'Roberts', 'pull', 'have', 'just', 'one', 'complaint', 'Mexican', 'comedy', 'mean', 'streak', 'Certain', 'assume', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'humorous', 'seem', 'little', 'cold', 'blooded', 'have', 'seen', 'same', 'technique', 'several', 'movies', 'recently', 'okay', 'movie', 'callous', 'attitude', ""n't"", 'always', 'equal', 'funny', 'Still', 'are', 'enough', 'laughs', 'witty', 'lines', 'make']",The Mexican

Sadly, only the most passive of viewers will find this an acceptable mix; not only is this film incredibly overlong for the material, it ends up being boring and closes with an overwhelming sense of futility and will leave most questioning, &quot;So...what?&quot;Pitt does his best spastic loser impression, bumbling around the movie and trying to fix things with his girlfriend, an often-hysterical Roberts. Wyman's script is a lot less fun than it seems to think it is; attempts to make this a condensed &quot;Way Of The Gun&quot;-style gritty adventure as well as a comment on the dynamics of two people in impossible love fail horribly. In fact, since neither concept is properly developed, moments of startling violence look like a gimmick, and it's hard to believe for one frame of the movie that Pitt and Roberts' characters are/were ever/will ever be in love.The one bright spot of the movie is Gandolfini, whose complex (or at least moreso than any other character in this mess) hitman is brought to life by his trademark mix of warmth and alarming force.Unfortunately, he can't come close to saving the movie; &quot;The Mexican&quot; is a pointless and meandering movie so set in trying to be five or six other movies that it can't make its own name for itself.Interestingly, the deleted scenes on the DVD fill out some substantial plot holes, but otherwise don't explain how with two hours of screen time (and nearly 140 minutes with deleted scenes in the mix), a promising crew and two of the biggest stars in America today can accomplish nothing and have you caring much less than you did when you walked in.",2,Far too confused and underdeveloped to be entertaining,997315200,"08 9, 2001",2001,1781,"['quot', 'Mexican', 'quot', 'believe', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Julia', 'quot', 'White', 'Teeth', 'quot', 'Roberts', 'movie', 'coherent', 'script', 'optional', 'Sadly', 'only', 'most', 'passive', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'acceptable', 'mix', 'not', 'only', 'film', 'incredibly', 'overlong', 'material', 'up', 'being', 'boring', 'overwhelming', 'sense', 'futility', 'will', 'leave', 'most', 'questioning', 'quot', 'what', 'quot', 'Pitt', 'best', 'spastic', 'loser', 'impression', 'bumbling', 'movie', 'trying', 'fix', 'things', 'girlfriend', 'often-hysterical', 'Roberts', 'Wyman', 'script', 'lot', 'less', 'fun', 'think', 'attempts', 'make', 'condensed', 'quot', 'Way', 'Gun', 'quot', 'gritty', 'adventure', 'as', 'well', 'comment', 'dynamics', 'two', 'people', 'impossible', 'love', 'fail', 'horribly', 'fact', 'concept', 'properly', 'developed', 'moments', 'startling', 'violence', 'look', 'gimmick', 'hard', 'believe', 'one', 'frame', 'movie', 'Pitt', 'Roberts', 'characters', 'are/were', 'ever/will', 'ever', 'be', 'love.The', 'one', 'bright', 'spot', 'movie', 'Gandolfini', 'complex', 'least', 'moreso', 'other', 'character', 'mess', 'hitman', 'brought', 'life', 'trademark', 'mix', 'warmth', 'alarming', 'force.Unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'saving', 'movie', 'quot', 'Mexican', 'quot', 'pointless', 'meandering', 'movie', 'so', 'set', 'trying', 'be', 'five', 'six', 'other', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'own', 'name', 'itself.Interestingly', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'fill', 'out', 'substantial', 'plot', 'holes', 'otherwise', 'do', ""n't"", 'explain', 'how', 'two', 'hours', 'screen', 'time', 'nearly', '140', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'mix', 'promising', 'crew', 'two', 'biggest', 'stars', 'America', 'today', 'can', 'accomplish', 'nothing', 'have', 'caring', 'much', 'less', 'did', 'when', 'walked']",The Mexican

Brad is a low level criminal who promises Julia that retrieving a stolen priceless revolver in Mexico will be his last mission before he becomes a law abiding citizen.

Jerry Welbach(Brad Pitt) is sent to sunny M&eacute;xico to the small ( and we're talkin' tiny) town of San Miguel to pick up a special gun. But his girl(Julia Roberts) wants him to stay and head off to Las Vegas (pronounced ""lost wages"") with her. As an alternative to being rolled up in a carpet, doused with gasoline and set on fire Jerry elects to head south of the border and pick up the Mexican. But he's after a gun not a person although the gun is said to hold a girl's soul within it.Once Jerry sets off Murphy's law rules as he gets lost, ripped off in the seediest bar in all M&eacute;xico and then learns his girl has been kidnapped to insure his co-operation. And THEN he also learns, near the end that he's been double crossed, the gun is going to a buyer not to mob boss Margolese, as he was told. But in the end the power of the gun settles all, Jerry and his girl get togther, the gun goes where it belongs and the cheater gets cheated.

535088,A1RZ1KIP4LJYDZ,B00003CXRY,"moviefreak ""moviefreak2003""","[3, 3]","On one summer night, while I was quickly flipping channels on my television to see if anything good was on, I saw that a movie called The Mexican was going to begin.  Although I had never seen the film, I knew about the stars and though I never really admired them, I decided to give it a chance.  By the end of the two longest hours it took me to watch the film (wait, Battlefield Earth was even longer) I was highly disappointed that I had even bothered to watch such a horrible and boring film that tried to catch my attention numerous times but failed every time.Despite it having two superstars in the film industry, the Mexican is a film that is not worth seeing plainly because it is uninteresting and has nothing special in it.  More on the actual movie coming up later.  But for now: Plot.Brad Pitt takes on the role of Jerry Welbach, a man working for some weird agency.  Jerry plans to have a honeymoon or something with his girlfriend Samantha Barzel (Julia Roberts) but an unexpected change of plans forces him to go to Mexico to retrieve a gun called the Mexican (hence the film's title).  Unfortunately for Jerry, someone steals the gun from him and it's up to him to get back.  Meanwhile, Samantha is kidnapped by gay hitman Winston Baldry (played by James Gandolfini from TV's The Sopranos), who plans to get back at Jerry for some reason.  Jerry now has a whole lot to accomplish:  Getting the gun back, saving his girlfriend, and winning her heart back.  The rest of the movie shows the journey that Jerry embarks on and though the plot sounds interesting, the actual movie isn't.I don't really know if this movie is to be considered a comedy for there was complete silence while I watched it and my mouth never opened.  Okay, maybe for a cough but never for a laugh.  I don't know what the screenwriter was thinking when he wrote the screenplay but I feel that he was ashamed when he saw how terrible the movie is.  Not one joke, not one laugh.  Main Point:  This is not a comedy.  The film is probably a mix of romance (85% percent of the film) and thriller (15% percent) because it has a couple shootouts which might satisfy action fans.  Otherwise, I don't really know who to recommend this film to.The performances are good though Gandolfini steals the movie away with his brilliant portrayal of Winston Baldry.  He probably was cast because of his role on the Sopranos (or the other way around) but I don't think they should have made him gay because that doesn't make any impact on the film.  Julia Roberts gives her typical performance, where she always gets the good man in the end and lives happily ever after with him.  Though there's a sign through the film that she's falling for Gandolfini's character, it's a bit predictable of who she'll end up with.  Brad Pitt delivers an average performance as the person trying to win the girl of his dreams.  Again, it makes the film more predictable and the ending is spoiled from the very beginning.The biggest problem with the film is the longness.  The film is completely boring because instead of relying on plot twists to surprise the viewer, the script just enlarges one idea and adds more time to the film.  I feel that instead of the 123 minutes that took the film to explain every little thing, the screenwriter could have stuck to the little things and made it a plain 100 minute film.Overall, the Mexican is definetely a must-not buy.  However, if it's ever on TV, you should probably check it out.  Beware, though, boredness is coming from the very first minute.",2,Way too long but cast and performances keep it from failing,1043625600,"01 27, 2003",2003,3548,"['one', 'summer', 'night', 'was', 'quickly', 'flipping', 'channels', 'television', 'see', 'anything', 'good', 'was', 'saw', 'movie', 'called', 'Mexican', 'was', 'going', 'begin', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'knew', 'stars', 'never', 'really', 'admired', 'decided', 'give', 'chance', 'end', 'two', 'longest', 'hours', 'took', 'watch', 'film', 'wait', 'Battlefield', 'Earth', 'was', 'even', 'longer', 'was', 'highly', 'disappointed', 'had', 'even', 'bothered', 'watch', 'horrible', 'boring', 'film', 'tried', 'catch', 'attention', 'numerous', 'times', 'failed', 'time.Despite', 'having', 'two', 'superstars', 'film', 'industry', 'Mexican', 'film', 'not', 'worth', 'seeing', 'plainly', 'uninteresting', 'nothing', 'special', 'More', 'actual', 'movie', 'coming', 'up', 'later', 'now', 'Plot.Brad', 'Pitt', 'role', 'Jerry', 'Welbach', 'man', 'working', 'weird', 'agency', 'Jerry', 'have', 'honeymoon', 'something', 'girlfriend', 'Samantha', 'Barzel', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'unexpected', 'change', 'plans', 'forces', 'go', 'Mexico', 'retrieve', 'gun', 'called', 'Mexican', 'hence', 'film', 'title', 'Unfortunately', 'Jerry', 'someone', 'steals', 'gun', 'up', 'get', 'back', 'Meanwhile', 'Samantha', 'kidnapped', 'gay', 'hitman', 'Winston', 'Baldry', 'played', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'TV', 'Sopranos', 'who', 'get', 'back', 'Jerry', 'reason', 'Jerry', 'now', 'whole', 'lot', 'accomplish', 'Getting', 'gun', 'back', 'saving', 'girlfriend', 'winning', 'heart', 'back', 'rest', 'movie', 'journey', 'Jerry', 'plot', 'interesting', 'actual', 'movie', ""isn't.I"", 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'movie', 'be', 'considered', 'comedy', 'was', 'complete', 'silence', 'watched', 'mouth', 'never', 'opened', 'Okay', 'maybe', 'cough', 'never', 'laugh', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'screenwriter', 'was', 'thinking', 'when', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'feel', 'was', 'ashamed', 'when', 'saw', 'how', 'terrible', 'movie', 'Not', 'one', 'joke', 'not', 'one', 'laugh', 'Point', 'not', 'comedy', 'film', 'probably', 'mix', 'romance', '85', '%', 'percent', 'film', 'thriller', '15', '%', 'percent', 'couple', 'shootouts', 'might', 'satisfy', 'action', 'fans', 'Otherwise', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'who', 'recommend', 'film', 'to.The', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'Gandolfini', 'movie', 'away', 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'Winston', 'Baldry', 'probably', 'was', 'cast', 'role', 'Sopranos', 'other', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'gay', ""n't"", 'make', 'impact', 'film', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'typical', 'performance', 'where', 'always', 'good', 'man', 'end', 'happily', 'ever', 'sign', 'film', 'falling', 'Gandolfini', 'character', 'bit', 'predictable', 'who', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'average', 'performance', 'person', 'trying', 'win', 'girl', 'dreams', 'Again', 'film', 'more', 'predictable', 'ending', 'spoiled', 'very', 'beginning.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'longness', 'film', 'completely', 'boring', 'instead', 'relying', 'plot', 'twists', 'surprise', 'viewer', 'script', 'just', 'one', 'idea', 'more', 'time', 'film', 'feel', 'instead', '123', 'minutes', 'took', 'film', 'explain', 'little', 'thing', 'screenwriter', 'could', 'have', 'stuck', 'little', 'things', 'made', 'plain', '100', 'minute', 'film.Overall', 'Mexican', 'definetely', 'must-not', 'buy', 'However', 'ever', 'TV', 'should', 'probably', 'check', 'out', 'Beware', 'though', 'boredness', 'coming', 'very', 'first', 'minute']",The Mexican

At the start of the movie you can tell the couple have some tension in there relationship, Sam tells Jerry if he goes to Mexico she is going to go to Las Vegas to pursue her career. Along the way Sam gets kidnapped by a guy who is working for the guy who hired Jerry to go to Mexico. This movie is a good movie, but you hardly see BRAD and JULIA together in the movie, only at the start for a few minutes than again at the end for a few more minutes. I have to be honest this movie is not BRAD PITTS or JULIA ROBERTS best movie. I was expecting more, but instead I got less.

535092,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CXRY,Reviewer,"[2, 6]","A couple working on the give-and-take aspects of their relationship, an exquisitely crafted antique pistol with something of a diverse history and some questions concerning who is working for whom, all figure prominently in ""The Mexican,"" a black comedy directed by Gore Verbinski and starring Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt.  Jerry Welbach (Pitt), a somewhat less than astute young fellow in thrall to a criminal currently incarcerated, is given a seemingly simply assignment:  He is to go to Mexico, where he will rendezvous at a bar in a small town, at which time he will take possession of an invaluable hand-made pistol; he will then transport the item to the States and deliver it to his boss.  But there's a problem; his girlfriend, Samantha (Roberts) expects to go to Las Vegas at the same time, and their plans were already made and set in stone.  So what is a guy to do?  After Sam throws him out of their apartment and Jerry tries to explain-- in a memorable scene with her on the second story balcony, he on the ground looking up-- that if he doesn't do this job they will, well, KILL him, it doesn't make any difference.  After all, their trip to Vegas had already been planned, and he promised it would happen.  Talk about a guy between a rock and a hard place.  And it's only the beginning of a dark comedy of errors and circumstances that ultimately involves them with some double dealings and brings them into contact with a psychotic killer named Leroy (James Gandolfini).  Director Verbinski lends a nice touch to the movie, eliciting noteworthy performances from his actors and establishing early on his method of using specific landmarks-- a traffic signal and a cross-roads in the middle of nowhere, for example-- that give context and definition to what is happening, sometimes off-screen (as in the opening scene, when you only ""hear"" a traffic accident that becomes a pivotal part of the story).  He avoids slapstick and plays up the natural, subtle humor that drives the film.  The characters are well drawn and the dialogue is clever and witty (""You `Forrest Gumped' your way through this..."") and often very droll.  And he maintains a pace and develops an atmosphere in which the unexpected can be expected that keeps it all moving along nicely and right on track.  And there's a politically incorrect sensibility to the movie that is refreshing to see; in real life certain situations and cultures that are foreign to us are often viewed in stereotypical terms, so there is no reason to portray it otherwise in a film, especially when care has been taken to present it in an inoffensive manner, as it is here.  Taking on a decidedly unglamorous role, Roberts nevertheless creates a lively character with Sam, imbuing her with plenty of spunk and, of course, that trademark smile.  It's not a part that calls for a lot of depth, but she makes Sam likable and fun to watch, and she makes her banter with Jerry and Leroy credible and engaging.  Credit goes to Pitt, as well, for making the most of what is actually a leading man/character role; Jerry isn't the sharpest tool in the shed and he may be easily distracted, but-- like Sam-- he's not without some natural charm that makes him quite personable and interesting.  And there is a chemistry between the two that makes their relationship believable, especially when the sparks are flying.  Gandolfini, meanwhile, not to be outdone by his charismatic co-stars, makes an indelible mark as the sensitive, psychotic killer who turns out to be something of an enigma.  The supporting cast includes Bob Balaban (Nalin), David Krumholtz (Beck), Luis Felipe Tovar (Luis) and Gene Hackman (Margolis).  A lively romp that takes some unexpected turns, ""The Mexican"" has a dark side, but manages to remain uplifting and thoroughly entertaining.  There's a natural flow to the film and the laughs, generated by both the situations and the characters, are never forced but prompted, rather, by the spontaneity of it all.  It's a movie that never pretends to be anything other than what it is, which is pure entertainment.  It'll leave you with a smile on your face, some chuckles and some great lines to quote.  And that, my friends, is the magic of the movies.",4,Roberts and Pitt Make It Happen,983836800,"03 6, 2001",2001,4226,"['couple', 'working', 'give-and-take', 'aspects', 'relationship', 'exquisitely', 'crafted', 'antique', 'pistol', 'something', 'diverse', 'history', 'questions', 'concerning', 'who', 'working', 'whom', 'figure', 'prominently', 'Mexican', 'black', 'comedy', 'directed', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'starring', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Jerry', 'Welbach', 'Pitt', 'somewhat', 'less', 'astute', 'young', 'fellow', 'thrall', 'criminal', 'currently', 'incarcerated', 'given', 'seemingly', 'simply', 'assignment', 'go', 'Mexico', 'where', 'will', 'rendezvous', 'bar', 'small', 'town', 'time', 'will', 'take', 'possession', 'invaluable', 'hand-made', 'pistol', 'will', 'then', 'transport', 'item', 'States', 'deliver', 'boss', 'problem', 'girlfriend', 'Samantha', 'Roberts', 'go', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'same', 'time', 'plans', 'were', 'already', 'made', 'set', 'stone', 'what', 'guy', 'do', 'Sam', 'apartment', 'Jerry', 'explain', 'memorable', 'scene', 'second', 'story', 'balcony', 'ground', 'looking', 'up', ""n't"", 'do', 'job', 'will', 'well', 'KILL', ""n't"", 'make', 'difference', 'trip', 'Vegas', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'planned', 'promised', 'would', 'happen', 'Talk', 'guy', 'rock', 'hard', 'place', 'only', 'beginning', 'dark', 'comedy', 'errors', 'circumstances', 'ultimately', 'double', 'dealings', 'contact', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'named', 'Leroy', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'Director', 'Verbinski', 'nice', 'touch', 'movie', 'eliciting', 'noteworthy', 'performances', 'actors', 'establishing', 'early', 'method', 'using', 'specific', 'landmarks', 'traffic', 'signal', 'cross-roads', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'example', 'give', 'context', 'definition', 'what', 'happening', 'sometimes', 'off-screen', 'opening', 'scene', 'when', 'only', 'hear', 'traffic', 'accident', 'pivotal', 'part', 'story', 'slapstick', 'up', 'natural', 'subtle', 'humor', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'drawn', 'dialogue', 'clever', 'witty', 'Forrest', 'Gumped', 'way', 'often', 'very', 'droll', 'pace', 'atmosphere', 'unexpected', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'moving', 'along', 'nicely', 'right', 'track', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'sensibility', 'movie', 'refreshing', 'see', 'real', 'life', 'certain', 'situations', 'cultures', 'are', 'foreign', 'are', 'often', 'viewed', 'stereotypical', 'terms', 'reason', 'portray', 'otherwise', 'film', 'especially', 'when', 'care', 'been', 'taken', 'present', 'inoffensive', 'manner', 'here', 'Taking', 'decidedly', 'unglamorous', 'role', 'Roberts', 'nevertheless', 'lively', 'character', 'Sam', 'imbuing', 'plenty', 'spunk', 'course', 'trademark', 'smile', 'not', 'part', 'lot', 'depth', 'Sam', 'likable', 'fun', 'watch', 'banter', 'Jerry', 'Leroy', 'credible', 'engaging', 'Credit', 'Pitt', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'most', 'what', 'actually', 'leading', 'man/character', 'role', 'Jerry', ""n't"", 'sharpest', 'tool', 'shed', 'may', 'be', 'easily', 'distracted', 'Sam', 'not', 'natural', 'charm', 'quite', 'personable', 'interesting', 'chemistry', 'two', 'relationship', 'believable', 'especially', 'when', 'sparks', 'are', 'flying', 'Gandolfini', 'meanwhile', 'not', 'be', 'outdone', 'charismatic', 'co-stars', 'indelible', 'mark', 'sensitive', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'something', 'enigma', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'Nalin', 'David', 'Krumholtz', 'Beck', 'Luis', 'Felipe', 'Tovar', 'Luis', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Margolis', 'lively', 'romp', 'unexpected', 'turns', 'Mexican', 'dark', 'side', 'remain', 'uplifting', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'natural', 'flow', 'film', 'laughs', 'generated', 'situations', 'characters', 'are', 'never', 'forced', 'prompted', 'rather', 'spontaneity', 'movie', 'never', 'be', 'anything', 'other', 'what', 'pure', 'entertainment', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'smile', 'face', 'chuckles', 'great', 'lines', 'quote', 'friends', 'magic', 'movies']",The Mexican
535093,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,B00003CXRY,Robin Simmons,"[2, 2]","Widely promoted in posters, magazine and newspaper ad art and in theatrical trailers as a romantic, screwball road-movie, this film arrives on DVD in a great-looking widescreen transfer with extras.  Unfortunately, the promise of an extended on-screen coupling of Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts, two red-hot megawatt stars is quickly broken when the plot forces them to go their separate ways for most of the movie.J.H. Wyman's original screenplay has bounced around town and it's easy to see why. It's a confusing mish-mash of basically unrelated material. There's a feeble fable of a cursed, antique Mexican pistol, there's a sweet, weepy, sensitive gay hit man wonderfully played by burly James Ganolfini, and there's Brad Pitt's laid-back turn as a mobster's errand boy making one last run. Julia Roberts is pretty much a shrill whining caricature in bright colors who bonds with her sensitive, yet cold-blooded kidnapper (Gondolfini) while complaining about boyfriend Pitt.Even though things don't satisfactorily come together in this movie, it is visually pleasing.  Gore Verbinski (&quot;Mouse Hunt&quot;) directs with a verve but the forced material can't be overcome.  The commentary by the director and writer gets awfully pretentious and self-serving at times and the only thing that is made abundantly clear is that this movie was written by a person who has little life experience but has no doubt logged thousands of hours watching movies.  This film earned $60 million at the box office by movie goers who were duped into seeing something other than what was advertised.

535094,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXRY,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 5]","Those hoping to see Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts performing together in the same movie may well have to wait for the pair&#65533;s next joint effort - for &#65533;The Mexican&#65533; is definitely NOT that film.  Indeed, it is safe to say that the two stars share less than  of the film&#65533;s total running time occupying even the same country let alone the same scene.  Still, despite that limitation, &#65533;The Mexican&#65533; turns out to be a rather fun, rather screwy comedy crime caper, offering an offbeat plot, stylish direction and first-rate performances by a talented cast.The plot involves Pitt, as a young man named Jerry, who is sent on assignment to Mexico by a crime boss who wants him to retrieve a special Mexican pistol named, appropriately, &#65533;The Mexican.&#65533;  Meanwhile, Roberts plays his long time girlfriend, Samantha, who has just about had it with Jerry&#65533;s inability to commit to their relationship and who decides she is going to move to Vegas to start life anew as a waitress or a croupier.  While in Mexico, Jerry runs up against some serious setbacks, while in Vegas, Samantha is kidnapped by Leroy, who holds Samantha as a bargaining chip to ensure that Jerry doesn&#65533;t engage in any funny business on his way to completing his mission.Ever since &#65533;Pulp Fiction&#65533; in 1994, we have been subjected to one film after another in which criminals and hit men talk about the mundane matters of civilized living in between shoot-outs and gangland-style executions.  This is now the standard for any crime film that wants to be considered &#65533;hip,&#65533; &#65533;cool&#65533; and &#65533;contemporary.&#65533;  Sometimes this technique works and sometimes it doesn&#65533;t.  In the case of &#65533;The Mexican,&#65533; it mostly works.  This is due in no small measure to the playful screenplay by J.H. Wyman, who has managed to devise both humorous situations and high-spirited dialogue exchanges for his characters, a flashy directorial style by Gore Verbinski, who knows how to maintain an effective balance between humor and violence, and, above all, by delightful performances not only from Pitt and Roberts but from James Gandolfini, who literally steals the show as Roberts&#65533; gay kidnapper, a confidante who keeps offering words of wisdom to a brokenhearted Roberts on matters of interpersonal relationships. Gandolfino creates a character of amazing depth, variety and subtlety, managing to seem threatening, decent, ruthless and caring, all while remaining within a very tight range of expression.  It is one of the most effectively understated, yet rich, performances I have seen in a movie in a very long time.In &#65533;The Mexican,&#65533; Pitt once again demonstrates his undervalued skill as an actor.  The slightly quizzical, slightly befuddled expression he conveys throughout the film not only heightens the comedic elements of the screenplay, but creates a great deal of audience sympathy for this likable, well-meaning young man who just happens to be way in over his head with the rank company he is forced to deal with.  Roberts, likewise, does a stellar job as a woman who is alternately compassionate, frustrated, headstrong, feisty and committed.Yes, one hopes that, in their next venture together, Pitt and Roberts will choose a vehicle with a little more substance than &#65533;The Mexican&#65533; seems to have &#65533; and that they get to spend a little more on-screen time together as well.  In the meantime, however, &#65533;The Mexican&#65533; does provide a number of ancillary pleasures to make it well worth checking out.",3,overlong but generally fun,1010880000,"01 13, 2002",2002,3627,"['hoping', 'see', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'performing', 'together', 'same', 'movie', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'wait', 'pair', '65533', 's', 'next', 'joint', 'effort', '65533', 'Mexican', '65533', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'film', 'Indeed', 'safe', 'say', 'two', 'stars', 'share', 'less', 'film', '65533', 's', 'total', 'running', 'time', 'occupying', 'even', 'same', 'country', 'let', 'alone', 'same', 'scene', 'Still', 'limitation', '65533', 'Mexican', '65533', 'out', 'be', 'rather', 'fun', 'rather', 'screwy', 'comedy', 'crime', 'caper', 'offering', 'offbeat', 'plot', 'stylish', 'direction', 'first-rate', 'performances', 'talented', 'cast.The', 'plot', 'Pitt', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Jerry', 'who', 'sent', 'assignment', 'Mexico', 'crime', 'boss', 'who', 'retrieve', 'special', 'Mexican', 'pistol', 'named', 'appropriately', '65533', 'Mexican.', '65533', 'Meanwhile', 'Roberts', 'long', 'time', 'girlfriend', 'Samantha', 'who', 'just', 'about', 'had', 'Jerry', '65533', 's', 'inability', 'commit', 'relationship', 'who', 'going', 'move', 'Vegas', 'start', 'life', 'anew', 'waitress', 'croupier', 'Mexico', 'Jerry', 'up', 'serious', 'setbacks', 'Vegas', 'Samantha', 'kidnapped', 'Leroy', 'who', 'Samantha', 'bargaining', 'chip', 'ensure', 'Jerry', 'doesn', '65533', 't', 'engage', 'funny', 'business', 'way', 'completing', 'mission.Ever', '65533', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', '65533', '1994', 'have', 'been', 'subjected', 'one', 'film', 'criminals', 'hit', 'men', 'talk', 'mundane', 'matters', 'civilized', 'living', 'shoot-outs', 'gangland-style', 'executions', 'now', 'standard', 'crime', 'film', 'be', 'considered', '65533', 'hip', '65533', '65533', 'cool', '65533', '65533', 'contemporary.', '65533', 'Sometimes', 'technique', 'doesn', '65533', 't.', 'case', '65533', 'Mexican', '65533', 'mostly', 'due', 'small', 'measure', 'playful', 'screenplay', 'J.H', 'Wyman', 'who', 'managed', 'devise', 'humorous', 'situations', 'high-spirited', 'dialogue', 'exchanges', 'characters', 'flashy', 'directorial', 'style', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'who', 'how', 'maintain', 'effective', 'balance', 'humor', 'violence', 'delightful', 'performances', 'not', 'only', 'Pitt', 'Roberts', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'who', 'literally', 'show', 'Roberts', '65533', 'gay', 'kidnapper', 'confidante', 'who', 'offering', 'words', 'wisdom', 'brokenhearted', 'Roberts', 'matters', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'Gandolfino', 'character', 'amazing', 'depth', 'variety', 'subtlety', 'managing', 'seem', 'threatening', 'decent', 'ruthless', 'caring', 'remaining', 'very', 'tight', 'range', 'expression', 'one', 'most', 'effectively', 'understated', 'yet', 'rich', 'performances', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'very', 'long', 'time.In', '65533', 'Mexican', '65533', 'Pitt', 'once', 'again', 'undervalued', 'skill', 'actor', 'slightly', 'quizzical', 'slightly', 'befuddled', 'expression', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'comedic', 'elements', 'screenplay', 'great', 'deal', 'audience', 'sympathy', 'likable', 'well-meaning', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'way', 'head', 'rank', 'company', 'forced', 'deal', 'Roberts', 'likewise', 'stellar', 'job', 'woman', 'who', 'alternately', 'compassionate', 'frustrated', 'headstrong', 'feisty', 'committed.Yes', 'one', 'next', 'venture', 'together', 'Pitt', 'Roberts', 'will', 'choose', 'vehicle', 'little', 'more', 'substance', '65533', 'Mexican', '65533', 'have', '65533', 'get', 'spend', 'little', 'more', 'on-screen', 'time', 'together', 'as', 'well', 'meantime', 'however', '65533', 'Mexican', '65533', 'provide', 'number', 'ancillary', 'pleasures', 'make', 'well', 'checking', 'out']",The Mexican

535096,A2RN2AO4BE6F4K,B00003CXRY,"Scott Bright ""scottypotty""","[1, 1]","Movie Summary: Jerry Welbach is pretty much a loser with bad luck. He is trying to get his life together before his girlfriend Samantha makes good on her threat and leaves him. It's no surprise to her or us that Jerry fails again and Samantha is on her way to Las Vegas without even listening to Jerry's latest excuse. Had she listened she'd have heard a long drawn out confusing story about Jerry having to drive to Mexico to retrieve an antique pistol for a mob boss whom he is in debt to. Why they send Jerry is beyond everyone, but they do. Soon Jerry realizes that he is in over his head and Samantha turns up missing. Is there any way Jerry can get lucky enough to pull this job off?My Opinion: This movie is a case of all the pieces just not coming together. Mostly the story just never becomes engaging. I was stuck in a &quot;yeah who cares&quot; mood for most of the movie. Roberts and Pitt weren't bad, they just never had any chemistry with each other or the plot. The best relationship was between Pitt and the dog that came with the El Camino. James Gandolfini has a great part and may just be the best part of the movie. The plot tries to generate excitement with twists and turns, but none of them seem to work. I remember thinking that this was just a poor man's &quot;Snatch&quot; a movie which I thoroughly enjoyed by the way. When everything was said and done, I wasn't able to care about any of the couples in the film nor any of the characters (except the dog).  I had a lot of trouble with the fact that they sent a screw up like Jerry to retrieve the pistol when it seemed that they really wanted the pistol. Had they been expecting him to fail it would have been more believable. I was able to make it to the end of the movie and even watched the deleted scenes, but I was looking forward to the next movie while I was watching it.

The makers of ""The Mexican"" have created a film in which the two leads spend the majority of the film apart. Folly? Well, no.Jerry (Pitt) is a low-level errand boy for some local gangsters. He promises his self-help crazed girlfriend, Sam (Roberts), that he will settle down and find a respectable job, leaving that life behind. Jerry's boss has other ideas. Jerry must make one last run to pay him back for all of the jobs Jerry has screwed up. Jerry must go to Mexico to retrieve a legendary pistol called `The Mexican'. Sam is fed-up and leaves for Vegas without Jerry. Jerry heads for Mexico and runs into many complications. One of these complications is that Sam is kidnapped by Leroy (James Gandolfini), a hit man hired by Jerry's boss to babysit Sam and ensure that Jerry is successful.""The Mexican"" is essentially two road movies. The story of Jerry's trip to Mexico and Sam's trip to Vegas are told concurrently for much of the film. Each story is interesting and, at times, funny. But what these stories do is keep the two stars apart for all but about 30 minutes of the film. The two stories are well-told, but it seems odd that the two actors are apart.The Mexican is a legendary pistol. The legend behind the firearm is told more than once, each time the legend changes. As we watch these stories unfold, sepia-toned images play out as old newsreels or home movies. This is a nice touch. As the movie tells a story that is slightly over the top, these fable segments help to ground the rest of the film.Roberts is funny. She plays a fairly high maintenance woman. During the course of the film, she manages to make the audience care about the character. This is a real accomplishment given our initial impression of her character. Pitt is also good. A low-life but likable enough character.James Gandolfini is superb. Leroy's job is to grab Sam and hold her as insurance. As she spouts her self-help-isms, Leroy's inner-self is drawn to her. As they become friends, his professional life begins to conflict with his personal life. As they become friends, they share personal things which surprise us and make us laugh.

Julia Roberts finally plays someone who is not very likable, an overanalyzing Oprah Winfrey-watching fruitcake of a woman and of course James Gandolfini as the gay hitman.I liked the way this movie changed around every corner and was a sucession of good and bad luck. It is not a masterpiece in any way, but it is sure to put a smile on your face.",4,"Quite funny, quirky movie",999820800,"09 7, 2001",2001,563,"['think', 'thing', 'movie', 'people', 'want', 'label', 'comedy', 'even', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'mishmash', 'styles', 'film.I', 'loved', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'performance', 'stumbling', 'loser', 'hero', 'movie', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'finally', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'very', 'likable', 'overanalyzing', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey-watching', 'fruitcake', 'woman', 'course', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'gay', 'hitman.I', 'liked', 'way', 'movie', 'changed', 'corner', 'was', 'sucession', 'good', 'bad', 'luck', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'way', 'sure', 'put', 'smile', 'face']",The Mexican

Julia plays a wonderful quirky, smartypants, sensitive, woman in love.  Brad does very well as a slightly lost, good hearted semi-boyfriend just trying to keep himself alive while hoping that his semi-girlfriend will somehow understand.  James puts in a stellar performance as the guy who is ""very sensitive for a cold-blooded killer"".I recommend giving this movie a shot.  Leave your expectations at the door and just enjoy the show for what it is ... a quirky kinda dark romantic comedy.  It is well done, combining romance, action and emotional impact with comedy.There are some very funny scenes, a few somewhat deep scenes that deal with relationship issues and some dramatic scenes that are sad and some that are happy, all of them touching. There are also some subtle jokes, so keep your eyes and ears open!Admittedly, there was a point where I felt that the movie was going on a bit long, but it quickly became interesting again and I forgot about that.When you watch this movie, I recommend taking special note of the three main character's eyes.  The actors very effectively express their character's emotions and thoughts with their eyes.Enjoy!",4,A good mix,1016755200,"03 22, 2002",2002,1267,"[""'The"", 'Mexican', 'good', 'mix', 'comedy', 'romance', 'action', 'adventure', 'drama', 'suspense', 'Very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'Julia', 'wonderful', 'quirky', 'smartypants', 'sensitive', 'woman', 'love', 'Brad', 'very', 'well', 'slightly', 'lost', 'good', 'hearted', 'semi-boyfriend', 'just', 'trying', 'keep', 'alive', 'hoping', 'semi-girlfriend', 'will', 'somehow', 'understand', 'James', 'stellar', 'performance', 'guy', 'who', 'very', 'sensitive', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', '.I', 'recommend', 'giving', 'movie', 'shot', 'Leave', 'expectations', 'door', 'just', 'enjoy', 'show', 'what', 'quirky', 'kinda', 'dark', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'well', 'done', 'combining', 'romance', 'action', 'emotional', 'impact', 'comedy.There', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'few', 'somewhat', 'deep', 'scenes', 'deal', 'relationship', 'issues', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'are', 'sad', 'are', 'happy', 'touching', 'are', 'also', 'subtle', 'jokes', 'so', 'keep', 'eyes', 'ears', 'open', 'Admittedly', 'was', 'point', 'where', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'bit', 'long', 'quickly', 'became', 'interesting', 'again', 'forgot', 'that.When', 'watch', 'movie', 'recommend', 'taking', 'special', 'note', 'three', 'main', 'character', 'eyes', 'actors', 'very', 'effectively', 'express', 'character', 'emotions', 'thoughts', 'eyes.Enjoy']",The Mexican
