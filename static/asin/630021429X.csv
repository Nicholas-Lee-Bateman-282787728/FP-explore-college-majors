211781,A3CGVO10F7NPMJ,630021429X,A Customer,"[1, 1]","Just like little Rob, Carl Reiner has the flair and knowhow of the eighties to produce well-working teen comedies which were an abundance in those years: (Sixteen Candles, The Allnighter, The Sure Thing and The Breakfast Club to name a few). Reiner uses the dramatic talents of Mark Harmon and turns his role into a perfect laugh, as a failed actor teaching a summer school class with no clue. The movie used to make me angry growing up when I had back-to-back summer school years in high school, because our teachers were nothing like Mark Harmon. Clueless about teaching, he takes the class of the classic stereotypes out on everyday field trips. At the same time he tries to grab the heart of a successful teacher (Kirstie Alley) who sees herself as above his intelligence and maturity. This scenerio sound familiar yet?...The difference is the movie uses acting and comedic talents rather than dogs answering phones and space aliens taking the SATs. 'Summer School' is a great fish-out-of-water movie for this teacher, who gets in trouble with a hard-nosed pricipal and is forced to make his students work instead of take trips at the end. But E.G. Daily is the biggest reason to watch and listen. As the voice of Nickelodeon's 'Rugrats' Tommy for the last ten years, she's a successful and cool actress who stared in this movie as well as many others in the eighties. She's also a great singer and songwriter who usually sang songs for the movies she played in, like this one.

The topic this time is summer school and it has the typical slate of unique characters that often populate these kinds of movies.

There are a number of typical motifs that show up here. There are the hard-luck students who manage to make miraculous turnarounds at the last minute, the fellow teacher and love interest who starts out as the girlfriend of the straight-laced colleague who eventually falls for the reformed-slacker teacher and the tough administrator who seems unfair.

I have seen it plenty of times over the years, but I have not remembered that the students did not really pass the test only to show an improvement of their scores which is a realistic outcome. The characters of Summer School, believe it or not, are perfectly done because, as a teacher, I see a lot of the same traits in the students I actually work with. Probably the most clever creation of characters are Chainsaw and his pal Dave. I just don't see this that often. Whoever wrote the characters in certainly infused a lot of life to them by expanding on the obsession with Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The best scene of the film is the horror show staged for the female replacement teacher. That's why Summer School is a remarkable comedy overall.

I enjoyed Mark Harmon's and Kirstie Alley's performances, and seeing the star review reminded me of Courtney Thorne-Smith's performance back when she was an unknown (I always love looking at, or thinking about, movies from the 80s and 90s and having those wide-eyed moments when you recognize someone who's very well-known today, yet you glanced over them back in the day). Dean Cameron's role as one of the main class clowns was memorable.Even though the plot was funny and carefree, one can't help but think it's possible that kids who can't read, or who are dyslexic, or have seemingly insurmountable personal problems can't succeed if just one person or teacher took the time to show them they cared (minus the bribing - or did that help in the end?).This is an enjoyable film that hasn't lost its touch after 20 years (wow, how time flies!).

211801,A2HVL790PBWYTU,630021429X,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Oboy, I remember this film. Coming out in 1987, I saw SUMMER SCHOOL in the theater when I was a teen, and I remember laughing quite a bit. And even now the movie holds up well. With People magazine voting Mark Harmon 1986's Sexiest Man Alive, Paramount was quick to take advantage by casting him as the slacker lead of this sun-drenched teen/romantic comedy. Of course, it doesn't hurt to also have director Carl Reiner and three beautiful ladies (Alley, Thorne-Smith, and Fabiana Udenio) providing backup. And, for the trivia nuts, there's the early musical scoring work by Danny Elfman.The plot now: For southern California's Oceanfront High School the regular school semester has just ended. Freddy Shoop (Mark Harmon) is the rather shallow, extremely laid-back gym teacher, and he's rarin' to go on his Hawaiian getaway with his 21-year-old honey. Until, that is, he's tapped to conduct a summer school class (the subject being remedial English) to a pack of ""social deviants."" Freddy protests vigorously (""I ain't no English teacher!""), and, sure enough, the man shows early on that he's pretty clueless in the classroom.It doesn't help that his class consists of a loser set of misfits, among whose ranks include a pregnant teenager, a chronic sleeper, a daydreaming surfer girl, a sexy Italian exchange student (Udenio), and a duo of class clowns who worship creature feature flicks like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. But, then, guess what? Despite certain miscues (or to quote a nerd's grandmother: ""Is going on throw-up rides and rubbing barnyard animals your idea of quality education?""), a surprising thing happens. Freddy starts to care about his students, and his students start to care about more than just slacking off. Following the trend of these school pictures, there's the usual big exam at the finale. So will these remedial students measure up?I wouldn't call SUMMER SCHOOL a great comedy, but I would call it a good one. It's not as uproarious or as raunchy as PORKY'S, for example (not that I'm calling PORKY'S a great comedy, mind you). With a PG-13 rating, the tone here is often breezy and the humor frequently good-natured and (this is very important) unforced. Most of the credit falls on Carl Reiner, who's been around forever and certainly knows his comedy shtick. Carl helms the picture with experience and precision, giving just enough rope for his young actors to shine yet knowing when to rein them in.And then there's Mark Harmon. I've always pictured him as a poor man's Kevin Costner, in that there's a physical resemblance there and that Harmon's cinematic career hadn't taken off as well as Costner's had. Other than this flick, the only other films I can associate with Harmon are (2003)Freaky FridayandWorth Winning(a little romantic comedy which I really liked). However, in SUMMER SCHOOL, Mark Harmon shines effortlessly and is funnier than someone who started as quarterback for UCLA has any right to be. When the Sexiest Man Alive has a scene in which he talks while eating and you can see food chunks in his mouth, well, you must give him props for keeping it real.Harmon is ably backed by the kids who play Chainsaw and Dave. Two classic scenes they're key in involve the petting zoo killer bunnies and the unforgettable classroom massacre. And Courtney Thorne-Smith, gawd, I was crushing on her in this film as fiercely as anyone, and, after this role, you could see that she was going places. Meanwhile, according to the film commentary, Kirstie Alley's icy-cool (but endearing) performance as Shoop's potential love interest earned her a gig at CHEERS.SUMMER SCHOOL certainly isn't as gripping and message-driven as, say,Stand and DeliverorLean on Me. But, in its own way, camouflaged underneath the juvie chuckles, SUMMER SCHOOL has some things to say, about teen-aged pregnancy, underage drinking, and illiteracy. But the strongest point it might have made is that success doesn't have to come in leaps and bounds and isn't necessarily defined by straight A's. That, maybe, sometimes, actually putting out the effort and that learning by increments are enough to start with. After all (this is the sappy part), life is built on little moments, which then make up the big ones. So you can watch the film for its underlying message. Or you can watch it for the classroom massacre scene. Either way, it works.Side note: The film commentary as provided by Mark Harmon and Carl Reiner is, like the film itself, pleasant, easy-going, and even occasionally offers behind-the-scene nuggets. Harmon does most of the talking; remember that Reiner at this stage was in his mid-80's and has moments in which he comments with a ""Oh, I forgot about that one."" ""Inside the Teachers' Lounge"" functions as the ""making of"" featurette, while ""SUMMER SCHOOL Yearbook"" is interesting in that you get to see what several of the kids who played Shoop's students now look like.

211824,A1MZNOE1OABAQK,630021429X,thecableguy,"[5, 5]","""Summer School"" surprised a lot of critics by bringing something new to a genre most people had already had enough of by the time of its release (1987).  With a spunky screenplay and Carl Reiner's gift for comedic timing, the film fills in a gap neglected by the majority of the decade's other high school pics, whose styles were polarized between the rebellious, goofy sexcapades found in John Hughes' brat pack series, and more ""mature,"" galvanizing films like ""Stand and Deliver.""""Summer School"" begins with Danny Elfman's song ""Happy"" playing as the clock counts down and students prepare for summer.  Reiner himself portrays usual summer teacher, Mr. Dearadorian, who happens to win fifty thousand dollars in a scratch off lottery just as the last bell rings. His boss, Vice Principal Phil Gills (Robin Thomas) tries to tell him there is no Island, but he quits anyway.Gills approaches Freddy Shoop (Mark Harmon), a gym teacher who is ready to spend the summer in Hawaii with his girlfriend -- ""We got leis on and everything."" Gills threatens his tenure, so he decides to stay. Shoop tries to get his girlfriend to stay by quoting ""There's no place like home."" She says she understands and will just go without him.Mr. Shoop's class is made up of group of slackers and misfits who for a variety of reasons failed the English skills test required to graduate.There are: Dave and Chainsaw, an inseparable pair, one is obsessed with Chainsaw, the other with the film, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""; There's Alan, the black-sheep of a genius family; Anna Maria, a buxom foreign exchange student brushing up on her English skills; Pam House, a spaced-out surfer girl with a thing for Mr. Shoop (I think it's funny the DVD's ""Set-up"" menu features a picture of her); Kevin, a football player kicked off the team for ""being stupid""; Jerome, who spends most of the film in the bathroom; Rhonda, who is pregnant with either Sean Penn or David Lee Roth's child, Denise, a bad driver who suffers from dyslexia, and Larry who sleeps all the time because of his night job.At first Shoop doesn't take his job seriously and takes the class on field trips to the beach, go-kart races, and theme parks.  Then Dave and Chainsaw almost get arrested for drinking on the beach. Mr. Shoop says the booze was his, and gets arrested. Gills tries to fire him, but Dave and Chainsaw put on a Grand Guignol classroom show that scares away the replacement teacher, and the students demand Shoop returns. I'm probably revealing too much plot info here, but I mainly just wanted to note the blood and guts classroom scene doesn't seem as funny now in wake of all the school shootings. Though  I know if I hadn't have made splatter films in high school I probably would've blown up the school, so maybe the film will help some people.Anyway, Shoop seeks the aid of Robin Bishop (Kirstie Alley), who is teaching honor students who are spending their summer voluntarily in a classroom nearby.  He likes her.  She eventually likes him, even though she's seeing Gills.Everything turns out okay in the end as you'd expect from this type of film; what's different is that there aren't any real bad guys, just a lot of miscommunication.  Gills is presented in the worst light, but even he is spared the humiliation that similar characters in this genre of films usually receive (Ferris Bueller's Ed Rooney for example.)  Here, Gills just loses the girl because he's intolerant and inflexible. Shoop and his students learn how to adapt.Before ""Summer School,"" I always resented Harmon for ruining the TV show ""Moonlighting,"" but now I realize it's probably due more to the show's creators having a brain freeze after David and Maddie said two dirty words and finally slept together. ""Summer School"" was Harmon's first role after his ""Moonlighting"" appearances, and it's probably his most memorable and endearing (unless you like Ted Bundy).There are a few dated references -- for instance, Dave and Chainsaw sing Eddie Murphy's ""Party All the Time"" and Rhonda mentions Sean Penn's marriage to Madonna -- but the film should still entertain audiences young and old - it even includes an homage to ""From Here to the Eternity,"" with  Shoop and Robin kissing on the beach, joined by Shoop's dog, Wondermutt, and his favorite toy, a stuffed doll's head named Bob.",5,"""Happy that the world is upside down""",1171324800,"02 13, 2007",2007,4324,"['Summer', 'School', 'surprised', 'lot', 'critics', 'bringing', 'something', 'new', 'genre', 'most', 'people', 'had', 'already', 'had', 'enough', 'time', 'release', '1987', 'spunky', 'screenplay', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'gift', 'comedic', 'timing', 'film', 'fills', 'gap', 'neglected', 'majority', 'decade', 'other', 'high', 'school', 'pics', 'styles', 'were', 'polarized', 'rebellious', 'goofy', 'sexcapades', 'found', 'John', 'Hughes', 'brat', 'pack', 'series', 'more', 'mature', 'galvanizing', 'films', 'Stand', 'Deliver', 'Summer', 'School', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'song', 'Happy', 'playing', 'clock', 'down', 'students', 'prepare', 'summer', 'Reiner', 'usual', 'summer', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Dearadorian', 'who', 'win', 'fifty', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'scratch', 'lottery', 'just', 'last', 'bell', 'rings', 'boss', 'Vice', 'Principal', 'Phil', 'Gills', 'Robin', 'Thomas', 'tell', 'Island', 'anyway.Gills', 'approaches', 'Freddy', 'Shoop', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'gym', 'teacher', 'who', 'ready', 'spend', 'summer', 'Hawaii', 'girlfriend', 'got', 'leis', 'everything', 'tenure', 'stay', 'Shoop', 'get', 'girlfriend', 'stay', 'quoting', 'place', 'home', 'will', 'just', 'go', 'him.Mr', 'Shoop', 'class', 'made', 'group', 'slackers', 'misfits', 'who', 'variety', 'reasons', 'failed', 'English', 'skills', 'test', 'required', 'are', 'Dave', 'Chainsaw', 'inseparable', 'pair', 'one', 'obsessed', 'Chainsaw', 'other', 'film', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Alan', 'black-sheep', 'genius', 'family', 'Anna', 'Maria', 'buxom', 'foreign', 'exchange', 'student', 'brushing', 'up', 'English', 'skills', 'Pam', 'House', 'spaced-out', 'surfer', 'girl', 'thing', 'Mr.', 'Shoop', 'think', 'funny', 'DVD', 'Set-up', 'menu', 'picture', 'Kevin', 'football', 'player', 'kicked', 'off', 'team', 'being', 'stupid', 'Jerome', 'who', 'most', 'film', 'bathroom', 'Rhonda', 'who', 'pregnant', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'David', 'Lee', 'Roth', 'child', 'Denise', 'bad', 'driver', 'who', 'dyslexia', 'Larry', 'who', 'sleeps', 'time', 'night', 'job.At', 'first', 'Shoop', ""n't"", 'take', 'job', 'seriously', 'class', 'field', 'trips', 'beach', 'go-kart', 'races', 'theme', 'parks', 'Then', 'Dave', 'Chainsaw', 'almost', 'get', 'arrested', 'drinking', 'beach', 'Mr.', 'Shoop', 'booze', 'was', 'arrested', 'Gills', 'fire', 'Dave', 'Chainsaw', 'put', 'Grand', 'Guignol', 'classroom', 'show', 'away', 'replacement', 'teacher', 'students', 'demand', 'Shoop', 'returns', ""'m"", 'probably', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'info', 'here', 'mainly', 'just', 'wanted', 'note', 'blood', 'guts', 'classroom', 'scene', ""n't"", 'seem', 'funny', 'now', 'wake', 'school', 'shootings', 'know', 'had', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'splatter', 'films', 'high', 'school', 'probably', 'would', ""'ve"", 'blown', 'up', 'school', 'maybe', 'film', 'will', 'help', 'people.Anyway', 'Shoop', 'aid', 'Robin', 'Bishop', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'who', 'teaching', 'honor', 'students', 'who', 'are', 'spending', 'summer', 'voluntarily', 'classroom', 'nearby', 'eventually', 'even', 'seeing', 'Gills.Everything', 'out', 'okay', 'end', ""'d"", 'expect', 'type', 'film', 'what', 'different', 'are', ""n't"", 'real', 'bad', 'guys', 'just', 'lot', 'miscommunication', 'Gills', 'presented', 'worst', 'light', 'even', 'spared', 'humiliation', 'similar', 'characters', 'genre', 'films', 'usually', 'receive', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Ed', 'Rooney', 'example', 'Here', 'Gills', 'just', 'girl', 'intolerant', 'inflexible', 'Shoop', 'students', 'learn', 'how', 'adapt.Before', 'Summer', 'School', 'always', 'resented', 'Harmon', 'ruining', 'TV', 'show', 'Moonlighting', 'now', 'realize', 'probably', 'due', 'more', 'show', 'creators', 'having', 'brain', 'freeze', 'David', 'Maddie', 'said', 'two', 'dirty', 'words', 'finally', 'slept', 'together', 'Summer', 'School', 'was', 'Harmon', 'first', 'role', 'Moonlighting', 'appearances', 'probably', 'most', 'memorable', 'endearing', 'like', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'are', 'few', 'dated', 'references', 'instance', 'Dave', 'Chainsaw', 'sing', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Party', 'Time', 'Rhonda', 'mentions', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'marriage', 'Madonna', 'film', 'should', 'still', 'entertain', 'audiences', 'young', 'old', 'even', 'homage', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'Shoop', 'Robin', 'kissing', 'beach', 'joined', 'Shoop', 'dog', 'Wondermutt', 'favorite', 'toy', 'stuffed', 'doll', 'head', 'named', 'Bob']",N/A

I bought this at a DVD blow-out sale and decided to take a chance as the price was a steal.  I expected a typical teen gross-out comedy.  However, this is well directed and very heartwarming. Carl Reiner did a very skillful job at creating a sometimes hilarious film with excellent characters. The chemistry between Mark Harmon and Kirsty Alley is terrific. The kids in remedial English are great and surprisingly touching. By the way, anyone who loves the Texas Chainsaw Massacre will get a real buzz (pun intended) out of the character of Chainsaw, a kid who is obsessed with that movie. Loved it.

211829,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,630021429X,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","""Summer School"" (1987) is a solid mid-80s teen dramedy in the tradition of 1982's ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", 1985's ""Just One of the Guys"" and many others. Although it's no where near as good as ""Fast Times"" -- since that's the pick of the litter -- it's still a solid high school comedy-drama.Likable Mark Harmon plays a hip gym teacher, Shoop, who gets stuck teaching remedial English in Summer School. His students don't want to be there and neither does he, but at some point he develops fatherly concern for the kids. Meanwhile, Kirstie Alley plays another teacher at Summer School who catches Shoop's eye. Can Shoop get these kids to learn?The first act plays out in a fairly leisurely, languid manner, but somewhat amusing. It wasn't until around the mid-point of the movie that I really started to see Shoop's goodheartedness. Yes, he's a bit too irresponsible to be an effective teacher, but he makes up for it in that he cares about the kids and they, in turn, begin to care about him, and care about learning too.The group of teens consist of a jock, a stud, two horror film geeks, a prego girl, a cute blond, a hot foreign student, a nerd, a spirited Hispanic and a token black dude. It's to the film's credit that quite a few of these characters -- mostly rebels of one sort or another -- are fleshed-out enough that you begin seeing them as real people and actually like them. Take, for instance, the brief subplot about the jock and the prego girl. It's surprising touches like this that lift ""Summer School"" from mediocrity.Although Fabiana Udenio -- the foreign babe -- is certainly beautiful, Courtney Thorne-Smith steals her thunder as the cute blond, Pam. Speaking of Pam, there's a subplot that shows the naivet&eacute; and goodheartedness of Shoop when Pam asks to stay at his place. Anyone with a brain could see that Pam has the hots for him, but Shoop just sees her as a student in need and innocently allows her to (temporarily) stay. Alley's character, however, sees the obvious problems of the situation and opens Shoop's eyes.The reason I'm not giving ""Summer School"" a very high rating is because I don't want to mislead people into thinking that it's better than what it is. It's a second-tier 80s teen dramedy, but it's solid if you can handle the laid-back vibe and sometimes amateurish editing. What makes it so likable is its mid-80's soundtrack, warmheartedness and lack of raunch.The film was shot in the greater Los Angeles area and runs 97 minutes.Grade: B-",4,Goodhearted high school comedy,1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,2501,"['Summer', 'School', '1987', 'solid', 'mid-80s', 'teen', 'dramedy', 'tradition', '1982', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', '1985', 'Just', 'One', 'Guys', 'many', 'others', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'Fast', 'Times', 'pick', 'litter', 'still', 'solid', 'high', 'school', 'comedy-drama.Likable', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'hip', 'gym', 'teacher', 'Shoop', 'who', 'stuck', 'teaching', 'remedial', 'English', 'Summer', 'School', 'students', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'there', 'neither', 'point', 'fatherly', 'concern', 'kids', 'Meanwhile', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'teacher', 'Summer', 'School', 'who', 'Shoop', 'eye', 'Can', 'Shoop', 'get', 'kids', 'learn', 'first', 'act', 'out', 'fairly', 'leisurely', 'languid', 'manner', 'somewhat', 'amusing', 'was', ""n't"", 'mid-point', 'movie', 'really', 'started', 'see', 'Shoop', 'goodheartedness', 'Yes', 'bit', 'too', 'irresponsible', 'be', 'effective', 'teacher', 'up', 'kids', 'turn', 'begin', 'care', 'care', 'learning', 'too.The', 'group', 'teens', 'consist', 'jock', 'stud', 'two', 'horror', 'film', 'geeks', 'prego', 'girl', 'cute', 'blond', 'hot', 'foreign', 'student', 'nerd', 'spirited', 'Hispanic', 'token', 'black', 'dude', 'film', 'credit', 'few', 'characters', 'mostly', 'rebels', 'one', 'sort', 'are', 'fleshed-out', 'enough', 'begin', 'seeing', 'real', 'people', 'actually', 'Take', 'instance', 'brief', 'subplot', 'jock', 'prego', 'girl', 'surprising', 'touches', 'Summer', 'School', 'mediocrity.Although', 'Fabiana', 'Udenio', 'foreign', 'babe', 'certainly', 'beautiful', 'Courtney', 'Thorne-Smith', 'thunder', 'cute', 'blond', 'Pam', 'Speaking', 'Pam', 'subplot', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'goodheartedness', 'Shoop', 'when', 'Pam', 'stay', 'place', 'Anyone', 'brain', 'could', 'see', 'Pam', 'hots', 'Shoop', 'just', 'student', 'need', 'innocently', 'temporarily', 'stay', 'Alley', 'character', 'however', 'obvious', 'problems', 'situation', 'Shoop', 'eyes.The', 'reason', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'Summer', 'School', 'very', 'high', 'rating', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'mislead', 'people', 'thinking', 'better', 'what', 'second-tier', '80s', 'teen', 'dramedy', 'solid', 'can', 'handle', 'laid-back', 'vibe', 'sometimes', 'amateurish', 'editing', 'What', 'so', 'likable', 'mid-80', 'soundtrack', 'warmheartedness', 'lack', 'raunch.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'greater', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'area', '97', 'minutes.Grade', 'B-']",N/A
