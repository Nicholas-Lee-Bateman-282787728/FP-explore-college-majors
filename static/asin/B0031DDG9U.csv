1317119,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B0031DDG9U,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[5, 5]","This 2008 film vividly captures the frenzy of a maddening crowd who, under their God's law, participate in the stoning death of a woman falsely accused of adultery.  It is a remarkable film in a village of Iran where an evil husband and father of four decides he wants a divorce to marry a 14 year old girl.  He schemes, bribes and lies with others to have the woman convicted under Islam laws of dishonor with adultery and where punishment is to publicly stone the criminal to death.Brilliant acting!The film was so well done, to watch the faces of the characters tells so much, words are not needed.  Every facial expression was shown with great precision.  This is what good acting is all about, when we can READ the face.  The setting is perfected, the music so moving and erie as it takes the viewer through to the next scene.  The music fit the moods like no other.The majority of characters are powerful, ugly villains soaked in cold-hearted inhumanity, to a woman with utmost courage and love.  It is so emotional, disturbing, tense, and downright sickening that one can hardly imagine a barbaric event can still take place in countries, all in the name of their God.Warning: extremely graphic!One has to be warned that this film does portray the stoning death.  It is very difficult to watch as it comes across much too vivid.  If children wander into the room, please escort them out.  It may be traumatic for young ones.The story focuses on a French journalist whose vehicle breaks down in a village to learn from an aunt that her neice was stoned to death.  The aunt, Zahra, sneaks to divulge to the journalist what happened in the town the day before.  She asks him to record the story of her neice.  Soraya is a beautiful young wife with two boys and two girls.  We learn that her cheating husband has turned the two boys against her and soon he further plots to have the woman accused of cheating so he will not have to pay support.  The mission with bribery is on by several in the village.The film is based on a true story of victims of stoning in modern Iran.  It is one that you can say is certainly unforgettable.In an interview online with Nowrasteh, American born Hollywood writer and director said,  ""I want people never to forget what a stoning is,"" Nowrasteh says. ""I've seen it on tape, and it's much worse.""It is important to know why the director felt this film should display the brutality of the stoning.  He said in another interview:  ""It had to be hard to watch,"" Nowrasteh insists. ""It does a disservice to the victims to water it down. So in the editing, we tried to strike a balance: push it, but not enough to send everyone out the theater. We tested different cuts, and when we got it down to only one walk-out, I knew it was right."".....Rizzo",5,Words of director:  I want people to never forget what a stoning is.,1270598400,"04 7, 2010",2010,2781,"['2008', 'film', 'vividly', 'frenzy', 'maddening', 'crowd', 'who', 'God', 'law', 'participate', 'stoning', 'death', 'woman', 'falsely', 'accused', 'adultery', 'remarkable', 'film', 'village', 'Iran', 'where', 'evil', 'husband', 'father', 'four', 'decides', 'divorce', 'marry', '14', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'bribes', 'lies', 'others', 'have', 'woman', 'convicted', 'Islam', 'laws', 'dishonor', 'adultery', 'where', 'punishment', 'publicly', 'stone', 'criminal', 'death.Brilliant', 'acting', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'watch', 'characters', 'so', 'much', 'words', 'are', 'not', 'needed', 'facial', 'expression', 'was', 'shown', 'great', 'precision', 'what', 'good', 'acting', 'about', 'when', 'can', 'READ', 'face', 'setting', 'perfected', 'music', 'so', 'moving', 'erie', 'viewer', 'next', 'scene', 'music', 'fit', 'moods', 'other.The', 'majority', 'characters', 'are', 'powerful', 'ugly', 'soaked', 'cold-hearted', 'inhumanity', 'woman', 'utmost', 'courage', 'love', 'so', 'emotional', 'disturbing', 'tense', 'downright', 'sickening', 'one', 'can', 'hardly', 'imagine', 'barbaric', 'event', 'can', 'still', 'take', 'place', 'countries', 'name', 'God.Warning', 'extremely', 'graphic', 'One', 'be', 'warned', 'film', 'portray', 'stoning', 'death', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'across', 'much', 'too', 'vivid', 'children', 'wander', 'room', 'please', 'escort', 'out', 'may', 'be', 'traumatic', 'young', 'ones.The', 'story', 'focuses', 'French', 'journalist', 'vehicle', 'down', 'village', 'learn', 'aunt', 'neice', 'was', 'stoned', 'death', 'aunt', 'Zahra', 'divulge', 'journalist', 'what', 'happened', 'town', 'day', 'record', 'story', 'neice', 'Soraya', 'beautiful', 'young', 'wife', 'two', 'boys', 'two', 'girls', 'learn', 'cheating', 'husband', 'turned', 'two', 'boys', 'soon', 'further', 'plots', 'have', 'woman', 'accused', 'cheating', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'pay', 'support', 'mission', 'bribery', 'several', 'village.The', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'victims', 'stoning', 'modern', 'Iran', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'certainly', 'unforgettable.In', 'interview', 'online', 'Nowrasteh', 'American', 'born', 'Hollywood', 'writer', 'director', 'said', 'want', 'people', 'never', 'forget', 'what', 'stoning', 'Nowrasteh', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'tape', 'much', 'worse', 'important', 'know', 'why', 'director', 'felt', 'film', 'should', 'display', 'brutality', 'stoning', 'said', 'interview', 'had', 'be', 'hard', 'watch', 'Nowrasteh', 'disservice', 'victims', 'water', 'down', 'So', 'editing', 'tried', 'strike', 'balance', 'push', 'not', 'enough', 'send', 'everyone', 'theater', 'tested', 'different', 'cuts', 'when', 'got', 'down', 'only', 'one', 'walk-out', 'knew', 'was', 'right', '..Rizzo']",The Stoning of Soraya M.
1317120,A1R8LZYZR3377O,B0031DDG9U,ajsteele,"[1, 1]","I don't think most people seek out a film like &#34;The Stoning Of Soraya M&#34;, they sort of stumble upon it. The same went for me. This is a five star film because not only does the acting appear to be non acting (as in ultra good), but the subject matter is eductional. Some reviewers have used a term like, &#34;enjoyable&#34; to describe the film. I even read, &#34;get out the popcorn.&#34; All I can say is &#34;Ugh&#34; to these remarks. Like &#34;The Passion Of The Christ&#34;, the film is not &#34;entertaining&#34; in the traditional sense. These films work by mesmerizing the viewer with the horrors of human existence in a brutal and unfair world.Based on the true story of Soraya M., a Middle Eastern woman subjected like many to live under Sharia Law (the law of Islam), the film takes us through the mostly unpleasant happenings of her life. Accused of &#34;adultry&#34; by her husband, she is faced with the reality of being stoned to death in the remote, male dominated village in which she lives. In certain scenes, Soraya, played flawlessly by the beautiful Mozhan Marno, we get glimpses of how beautiful life could be in a flower ridden field with her children, as birds fly freely above them. How powerfully such a scene contrasts with real life is both sad and blissful all at once. As numerous viewers have already stated, the film is extremely violent, but not without purpose, as some ridiculous horror film would be. We are dealing with the highest form of cinema with a film such as this. Personally I will never forget the incredible cinematic impact that took place in my life after viewing. Every facet of human emotion is brilliantly depicted. Would I recommend the film? Yes, but not to the minds of those focused on pure entertainment, as opposed to pure knowledge.",5,Monumental,1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,1801,"['do', ""n't"", 'think', 'most', 'people', 'seek', 'out', 'film', '34', 'Stoning', 'Soraya', 'M', '34', 'sort', 'stumble', 'same', 'went', 'five', 'star', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'acting', 'appear', 'be', 'non', 'acting', 'ultra', 'good', 'subject', 'matter', 'eductional', 'reviewers', 'have', 'used', 'term', '34', 'enjoyable', '34', 'describe', 'film', 'even', 'read', '34', 'get', 'popcorn.', '34', 'can', 'say', '34', 'Ugh', '34', 'remarks', '34', 'Passion', 'Christ', '34', 'film', 'not', '34', 'entertaining', '34', 'traditional', 'sense', 'films', 'work', 'mesmerizing', 'viewer', 'horrors', 'human', 'existence', 'brutal', 'unfair', 'world.Based', 'true', 'story', 'Soraya', 'M.', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'woman', 'subjected', 'many', 'live', 'Sharia', 'Law', 'law', 'Islam', 'film', 'mostly', 'unpleasant', 'happenings', 'life', 'Accused', '34', 'adultry', '34', 'husband', 'faced', 'reality', 'being', 'stoned', 'death', 'remote', 'male', 'dominated', 'village', 'certain', 'scenes', 'Soraya', 'played', 'flawlessly', 'beautiful', 'Mozhan', 'Marno', 'get', 'glimpses', 'how', 'beautiful', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'flower', 'ridden', 'field', 'children', 'birds', 'fly', 'freely', 'How', 'powerfully', 'such', 'scene', 'real', 'life', 'sad', 'blissful', 'once', 'numerous', 'viewers', 'have', 'already', 'stated', 'film', 'extremely', 'violent', 'not', 'purpose', 'ridiculous', 'horror', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'are', 'dealing', 'highest', 'form', 'cinema', 'film', 'such', 'Personally', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'incredible', 'cinematic', 'impact', 'took', 'place', 'life', 'viewing', 'facet', 'human', 'emotion', 'brilliantly', 'depicted', 'Would', 'recommend', 'film', 'Yes', 'not', 'minds', 'focused', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'opposed', 'pure', 'knowledge']",The Stoning of Soraya M.
1317121,AJYILFULOQ3CX,B0031DDG9U,a man from the east coast,"[2, 2]","The first thing I'll say about this film is that I couldn't disagree more strongly with Kathleen C. Fennessy's Amazon.com review.  No, this film would not somehow been better as a documentary, and no, these first-rate actors are not investing their mono-dimensional roles with conviction, since these aren't mono-dimensional roles.This is a film that, once seen, can't ever be forgotten.  Mozhan Marno plays Soraya, a woman falsely accused of adultery by her husband.  His motive is to marry a girl only fourteen years old, and when Soraya won't agree to a divorce, he convinces the authorities that she has committed adultery against him.It's during this process that we see how much the Iranian people live in fear of the religious authorities ruling over them.  A lowly fix-it man is bullied into testifying against Soraya, and eventually, even her own two sons turn against her.The scenes occurring just before Soraya is led out to be executed are unforgettable; Soraya's tender love for her daughters is observed as being more significant that her fear of the terrible death that awaits her.  As she gives her family treasures to her daughters, she is calm and affectionate  towards them.  This is the last time they will see her, and she wants to be remembered for who she is.  So much is communicated onscreen not by words but rather by tone and expression; it's riveting, it is tragic ... and finally it is enraging.  For how can any society stand by and allow this sort of thing to happen?  Yet the reality of the atrocity committed hear is inescapable.Soraya's friend Zahra, played by Shohreh Aghdashloo, is witness to this false accusation and subsequent execution by stoning; yet she has no outlet to the outside world, no way to tell anyone of this terrible atrocity committed against her friend Soraya.  Then, French-Iranian journalist Freidoune Sahebjam's (Jim Caviezel) car breaks down quite close to Zahra's home.  She befriends him, and tells him Soraya's story.Shohreh's riveting performance is quite convincing as a woman whose heart has been shattered beyond recovery, but whose unbreakable will to tell the world of this injustice is without equal.  This is an actress who can communicate volumes in a single glance.Jim Caviezel is only in this film for about twenty minutes, yet his performance in noteworthy.  A master of his craft, he doesn't just get the accent spot-on; his character is inhabited and animated by Freidoune Sahebjam's middle eastern cultural heritage.  Caviezel isn't just someone who does accents well; this is someone who not only becomes his character, he becomes an embodiment of his character's culture.  Caviezel's performance alone is worth the price of admission, yet there's so much more to recommend this important, well-acted, and profoundly effecting film.Be warned that this film is not for the weak of heart.  Those of a particularly sensitive nature must prepare themselves for the execution scene, as very little is left to the imagination.  It's not just the blood and suffering depicted that effects one so profoundly; it is the presentation of humanity at its worse.  One can't pretend that this is ""just a film""; this sort of thing happens quite frequently, even today.I can't recommend this masterful film highly enough.  This film has a very important story to tell, and the filmmakers quite refreshingly realize that an important story must be presented with first-rate acting, direction and special effects.  No punches are pulled, yet no one beats you over the head with the film's message.  This is quite simply a great film, one that once seen, is never forgotten.",4,Absolutely a Must-See Film,1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,3634,"['first', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'say', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'more', 'strongly', 'Kathleen', 'C.', 'Fennessy', 'Amazon.com', 'review', 'No', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'somehow', 'been', 'better', 'documentary', 'first-rate', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'investing', 'mono-dimensional', 'roles', 'conviction', 'are', ""n't"", 'mono-dimensional', 'roles.This', 'film', 'once', 'seen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ever', 'be', 'forgotten', 'Mozhan', 'Marno', 'Soraya', 'woman', 'falsely', 'accused', 'adultery', 'husband', 'motive', 'marry', 'girl', 'only', 'fourteen', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'Soraya', 'wo', ""n't"", 'agree', 'divorce', 'authorities', 'committed', 'adultery', 'him.It', 'process', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'Iranian', 'people', 'live', 'fear', 'religious', 'authorities', 'ruling', 'lowly', 'fix-it', 'man', 'bullied', 'testifying', 'Soraya', 'eventually', 'even', 'own', 'two', 'sons', 'turn', 'her.The', 'scenes', 'occurring', 'just', 'Soraya', 'led', 'out', 'be', 'executed', 'are', 'unforgettable', 'Soraya', 'tender', 'love', 'daughters', 'observed', 'being', 'more', 'significant', 'fear', 'terrible', 'death', 'family', 'daughters', 'calm', 'affectionate', 'towards', 'last', 'time', 'will', 'see', 'be', 'remembered', 'who', 'So', 'much', 'communicated', 'not', 'words', 'rather', 'tone', 'expression', 'riveting', 'tragic', 'finally', 'enraging', 'how', 'can', 'society', 'stand', 'allow', 'sort', 'thing', 'happen', 'reality', 'atrocity', 'committed', 'hear', 'inescapable.Soraya', 'friend', 'Zahra', 'played', 'Shohreh', 'Aghdashloo', 'witness', 'false', 'accusation', 'subsequent', 'execution', 'stoning', 'outlet', 'outside', 'world', 'way', 'tell', 'anyone', 'terrible', 'atrocity', 'committed', 'friend', 'Soraya', 'Then', 'French-Iranian', 'journalist', 'Freidoune', 'Sahebjam', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'car', 'breaks', 'down', 'quite', 'close', 'Zahra', 'home', 'Soraya', 'story.Shohreh', 'riveting', 'performance', 'quite', 'convincing', 'woman', 'heart', 'been', 'shattered', 'recovery', 'unbreakable', 'will', 'tell', 'world', 'injustice', 'equal', 'actress', 'who', 'can', 'communicate', 'volumes', 'single', 'glance.Jim', 'Caviezel', 'only', 'film', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'yet', 'performance', 'noteworthy', 'master', 'craft', ""n't"", 'just', 'get', 'accent', 'spot-on', 'character', 'inhabited', 'animated', 'Freidoune', 'Sahebjam', 'middle', 'eastern', 'cultural', 'heritage', 'Caviezel', ""n't"", 'just', 'someone', 'who', 'accents', 'well', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'character', 'embodiment', 'character', 'culture', 'Caviezel', 'performance', 'alone', 'price', 'admission', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'recommend', 'important', 'well-acted', 'profoundly', 'effecting', 'film.Be', 'warned', 'film', 'not', 'weak', 'heart', 'particularly', 'sensitive', 'nature', 'must', 'prepare', 'execution', 'scene', 'very', 'little', 'left', 'imagination', 'not', 'just', 'blood', 'suffering', 'depicted', 'effects', 'one', 'so', 'profoundly', 'presentation', 'humanity', 'worse', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'just', 'film', 'sort', 'thing', 'quite', 'frequently', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'masterful', 'film', 'highly', 'enough', 'film', 'very', 'important', 'story', 'tell', 'filmmakers', 'quite', 'refreshingly', 'realize', 'important', 'story', 'must', 'be', 'presented', 'first-rate', 'acting', 'direction', 'special', 'effects', 'punches', 'are', 'pulled', 'yet', 'one', 'head', 'film', 'message', 'quite', 'simply', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'once', 'seen', 'never', 'forgotten']",The Stoning of Soraya M.

It is a fine film that should be supported, and circulated, and admired.  It derives it's power from its clear and shocking narrative and from the outstanding performances of its cast, and its unsparing attention to the suffering of Soraya M. who is stoned to death in her village in Iran.  The fact that people are being stoned today in a number of countries is as horrifying as it is true.  What can we do to stop this barbaric practice? What can we do to support the women in these countries who cannot defend themselves against laws that denigrate their value and impose upon them unfair standards for their defense in criminal proceedings? --- This is a brave film for focusing on one such case, and the egregious cruelty heaped on the victim.  And it leaves the viewer wondering what a stoning means for all the people of a village who participate in it, including children who gather the stones.

The disgrace of seeing my fellow humans act this way, especially in the name of justice and religion is really beyond words. This movie is simple, graphic, powerful and painful, yet it is also joyous in how the truth finally does get out. I've never seen the Passion of Christ, from the same producers, but heard about it, and can imagine this has some of that intensity. It is not for everyone and I'd not recommend it for children under 16 or anyone who has been badly abused, but for anyone else it is highly recommended.Islam is a religion like all the others that preaches love and peace etc. etc., yet without respect for the rights and sanctity of the INDIVIDUAL (and fearful blind faith following and upholding of traditions), this is exactly what happens, and will continue to until we stop it.

1317126,ARA48345JZPZR,B0031DDG9U,Archmaker,"[15, 16]","I have seen two films about the life of women under Islamic fundamentalism: ""Osama"" about life under the pre 9/11 Taliban rule in Afghanistan, a film made by Afghanis; and now, ""The Stoning of Soraya M."" based on the true story and book by an expat Iranian journalist, and the film also involving many expat Iranians, about the early rule of the Ayotollahs after the fall of the Shah.  Both are chilling, sobering, and despairing accounts of the lives of women who have few rights and virtually no say in their own destinies.As Soraya is told in this film, in accusations of adultery the woman ""must prove her innocence"" but if accusing her husband she ""must prove his guilt"".  This is the hypocritical and pardoxical world women find themselves when a society turns to a fundamentalism and fanatacism that denies them full legal and moral standing.It would be almost impossible to believe that a barbaric punishment like stoning would actually take place in the 21st century.  And yet I have seen actual documentary footage of it, in today's Iran.  Who would have believed we would see beheadings, and all the other forms of 12th century barbarism reappear in our age?I don't need to tell you this story.  The title tells you where it is going, and you can be sure that injustice is woven throughout this tragic story.  The debasement of Islam, the confining of the society in the name of religion, the double standards applied to men and women, the intimidation of basically good people by the pressure and fear demanding conformity, the corruption of law and justice.  These themes present themselves as we watch the inevitable unfold inexorably leading to tragedy.The actors are all fine, and the filmmakers have wisely told this story straight, without hysteria and amplification, but simply, directly and straight as a gut punch. And the ending is as terrible as one imagines, presented in all its brutality but with as much restraint as the filmmakers could manage without denying the truth of this terrible torture/punishment.And in the end the courageous aunt of Soraya who has defied the conventions and corruption of power that has brought this about shouts to the heavens that the world will know of this!

I think this is a powerful film intended to bring awareness and outrage toward the particular brutal immoral practice of honor killing/stoning particularly against the female primary targets. Although the scene depicting the stoning of Soraya was extremely brutal and hard to watch, I wouldn't categorize it as torture porn like The Passion of the Christ. I thought it was necessary to graphically depict the horror of stoning. I seriously doubt the filmmaker's intension was too demonize muslims and convert people to christianity or atheism.The fact of the matter is that the particular atrocity of honor killing/stoning  of females does happen in the muslim world, it is a phenomenon. It doesn't mean all muslim men are evil. It doesn't justify U.S. Imperialist invasions and occupations of Afghanistan, Iraq or Iran, or U.S. support of Israel. Dropping bombs and sending in marauding imperialist soldiers wont bring liberation and equality for muslim females.Honor killing/stoning is just one of many forms of violence against females that occur all over the world, in all cultures and religions. The modern western societies also have their everyday misogynist atrocities against females. Violence, rape, child molestation are common occurrences. Sexual slavery, objectification and degradation of females is pretty mainstream, whether in the brothels, massage parlors, strip clubs, or porn. No, those females are not independent feminists taking control of their sexuality. Most of those females are either literally forced against their will at gun point, coerced, have a history of sexual abuse, or manipulated into thinking they're making a wise choice. Porn is just filmed prostitution. And the pimps/porn producers, usually men take the bulk of the profits, while the females do the bulk of the work being used and abused as human blow up dolls.If you liked this movie I recommend watching the turkish film BLISS and french film CHAOS.",5,REALLY POWERFUL ANTI HONOR KILLING/STONING MOVIE,1342224000,"07 14, 2012",2012,1974,"[""'m"", 'atheist', 'leftist', 'think', 'powerful', 'film', 'intended', 'bring', 'awareness', 'outrage', 'particular', 'brutal', 'immoral', 'practice', 'honor', 'killing/stoning', 'particularly', 'female', 'primary', 'targets', 'scene', 'depicting', 'stoning', 'Soraya', 'was', 'extremely', 'brutal', 'hard', 'watch', 'would', ""n't"", 'categorize', 'torture', 'porn', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'thought', 'was', 'necessary', 'graphically', 'depict', 'horror', 'stoning', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'filmmaker', 'intension', 'was', 'too', 'demonize', 'muslims', 'convert', 'people', 'christianity', 'atheism.The', 'fact', 'matter', 'particular', 'atrocity', 'honor', 'killing/stoning', 'females', 'happen', 'muslim', 'world', 'phenomenon', ""n't"", 'mean', 'muslim', 'men', 'are', 'evil', ""n't"", 'justify', 'U.S.', 'Imperialist', 'invasions', 'occupations', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'Iran', 'U.S.', 'support', 'Israel', 'Dropping', 'bombs', 'sending', 'marauding', 'imperialist', 'soldiers', 'wont', 'bring', 'liberation', 'equality', 'muslim', 'females.Honor', 'killing/stoning', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'forms', 'violence', 'females', 'occur', 'world', 'cultures', 'religions', 'modern', 'western', 'societies', 'also', 'have', 'everyday', 'misogynist', 'atrocities', 'females', 'Violence', 'rape', 'child', 'molestation', 'are', 'common', 'occurrences', 'Sexual', 'slavery', 'objectification', 'degradation', 'females', 'pretty', 'mainstream', 'brothels', 'massage', 'parlors', 'strip', 'clubs', 'porn', 'No', 'females', 'are', 'not', 'independent', 'feminists', 'taking', 'control', 'sexuality', 'Most', 'females', 'are', 'literally', 'forced', 'will', 'gun', 'point', 'coerced', 'have', 'history', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'manipulated', 'thinking', ""'re"", 'making', 'wise', 'choice', 'Porn', 'just', 'filmed', 'prostitution', 'pimps/porn', 'producers', 'usually', 'men', 'take', 'bulk', 'profits', 'females', 'do', 'bulk', 'work', 'being', 'used', 'abused', 'human', 'blow', 'up', 'dolls.If', 'liked', 'movie', 'recommend', 'watching', 'turkish', 'film', 'BLISS', 'french', 'film', 'CHAOS']",The Stoning of Soraya M.

Contains English and Spanish subtitles.Not since `The Passion of the Christ' has an audience been assaulted by such a vivid, realistic vision of ignorance, hatred and unbridled brutality. Produced by the same producer as the aforementioned film, `The Stoning of Soraya M' returns the audience to a Middle East setting, a contemporary one this time (1986 Iran) to share and expose to the world a true tale of female oppression, archaic traditions and misplaced justice.This is definitely not a movie geared towards escapist family entertainment, but a serious, sobering social commentary produced to call our attention to a human rights violation that continues to occur in some parts of the world to this present day. Viewing a modern day stoning of an innocent woman would be difficult enough to endure if this was fictitious story, but knowing it's a re-enactment of an actual event is absolutely devastating.Knowing the subject matter of the film beforehand one obviously must approach it with a goal far more meaningful than a reprise from reality or the pursuit of entertainment. This is reality in its most stark, unvarnished manifestation and much like `The Passion of the Christ' the violence is captured in such a visceral, intense manner you will find it difficult if not impossible to keep your eyes focused on the screen. In other words your reason for viewing this film is to learn something and to elicit a personal response to a human rights issue that needs to be aggressively addressed. If those two goals are attained then the film has succeeded and the message received.Having said all that I don't mean to discount cinematic or artistic merits of this film, it's just that the message is so important that everything else simply pales in comparison. This is a quality film in every way; beautiful camera work, exotic soundtrack and brilliant acting. `The Stoning of Soraya M' is understandably something you won't want to watch over and over again but it demands at least one viewing from any thinking adult willing to put aside the simple pleasures of mindless entertainment for at least one evening to experience an immensely important film with a message that the world needs to hear.",5,"""That Is The Law"" ~ A Message The World Must Hear",1279497600,"07 19, 2010",2010,2266,"['Note', 'Film', 'presented', 'Persian', 'intermittent', 'English', 'Contains', 'English', 'Spanish', 'subtitles.Not', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'audience', 'been', 'assaulted', 'such', 'vivid', 'realistic', 'vision', 'ignorance', 'hatred', 'unbridled', 'brutality', 'Produced', 'same', 'producer', 'aforementioned', 'film', 'Stoning', 'Soraya', 'M', 'returns', 'audience', 'Middle', 'East', 'setting', 'contemporary', 'one', 'time', '1986', 'Iran', 'share', 'expose', 'world', 'true', 'tale', 'female', 'oppression', 'archaic', 'traditions', 'misplaced', 'justice.This', 'definitely', 'not', 'movie', 'geared', 'towards', 'escapist', 'family', 'entertainment', 'serious', 'sobering', 'social', 'commentary', 'produced', 'call', 'attention', 'human', 'rights', 'violation', 'occur', 'parts', 'world', 'present', 'day', 'Viewing', 'modern', 'day', 'stoning', 'innocent', 'woman', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'enough', 'endure', 'was', 'fictitious', 'story', 'knowing', 're-enactment', 'actual', 'event', 'absolutely', 'devastating.Knowing', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'beforehand', 'one', 'obviously', 'must', 'approach', 'goal', 'far', 'more', 'meaningful', 'reprise', 'reality', 'pursuit', 'entertainment', 'reality', 'most', 'stark', 'unvarnished', 'manifestation', 'much', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'violence', 'captured', 'such', 'visceral', 'intense', 'manner', 'will', 'find', 'difficult', 'not', 'impossible', 'keep', 'eyes', 'focused', 'screen', 'other', 'words', 'reason', 'viewing', 'film', 'learn', 'something', 'elicit', 'personal', 'response', 'human', 'rights', 'issue', 'be', 'aggressively', 'addressed', 'two', 'goals', 'are', 'attained', 'then', 'film', 'succeeded', 'message', 'received.Having', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'discount', 'cinematic', 'artistic', 'merits', 'film', 'just', 'message', 'so', 'important', 'everything', 'else', 'simply', 'pales', 'comparison', 'quality', 'film', 'way', 'beautiful', 'camera', 'work', 'exotic', 'soundtrack', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'Stoning', 'Soraya', 'M', 'understandably', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'least', 'one', 'viewing', 'thinking', 'adult', 'willing', 'put', 'aside', 'simple', 'pleasures', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'least', 'one', 'evening', 'experience', 'immensely', 'important', 'film', 'message', 'world', 'hear']",The Stoning of Soraya M.

I spent many hours contemplating the junk religion of fundamentalism and how such an event could even happen.  The intro to the book and the background on the author and his upbringing helps one believe this sad Salem witch trial type story.  That such a stoning has again happened another 1500 times since this awful day in Iran in 1979...and news today, June 1, 2011, of ""virginity testing"" of protesters in Egypt, says we are slow to learn.-Dan.....How do you give five stars to a book on a small town execution? Freidoune Sahebjam has written an insightful and brave account of an event unimaginable to most of us. I found this book helpful in showing me once again what a deadly infection fundamentalism can become and how this sickness can overtake an entire town in one afternoon. Indeed, to value purity over simple things like life and love and truth will always lead to death and heartache. Even more so if God is mixed in. This is the message of Sahebjam's book.This paperback can be read in one sitting and was penned by a French born and raised son of an Iranian Ambassador. It remains to this day a banned book in Iran, a country and culture not that far removed from a similar but different ethnic cleansing style fundamentalism I saw in Israel, Egypt and Palestine this week where I finished this book and wrote this review while on pilgrimage, amidst a backdrop of guns and soldiers and a chopper overhead. Muslims killing Christians and burning churches in nearby Egypt while we were there. Same old same old. We took in some 7,000 Jewish soldiers pointing assault rifles at Palestinians in the Holy Land, in Jerusalem, near the Western Wall, not far from the site and on the same day one Palestinian youth was shot and killed as I just learned from an airport monitor. We heard the gunfire over the wall. 34 were arrested; 12 killed the day we took off. Same old same old. Sad.But back to our small town in 1979. Soraya was a mother and wife married to an archetypal creep of a man who went so far as to bring to his own house prostitutes in order to insult his wife and offload his marriage; a man unwilling to count the cost of an honorable divorce. The religious execution plot was hatched by a man willing to make murderous co-conspirators out of neighbors and friends he'd known since childhood.Indeed Soraya's story was for me more than just another evil account of a befouled patriarchy. It was a death road telling of male politics and power trumping the basic spiritual values of truth, love, human kindness and the purity of a simple smile. On the flip side, this ritual and religious killing story and how it happened is also a tale of the courage of a loving aunt and niece against a male plot of lust, lies and collusion. It's a story about divorce and love and sex, power and money. Your basic movie themes. But this one really happened. It was for me a story also of love and beauty and truth and a woman who would risk friendliness and a smile she was known for and would eventually cost her everything. So yes, buy this book. It will energize you on the dangers of fundamentalism, energize you perhaps to speak up early when you see the demon of false purity coming your way. That's my take.Sure, this work, now in English, could have been written and translated a little better. But it is a miracle the story ever saw the light of day at all. I suggest you see the Netflix 2008 Lionsgate title (starring Aghdashloo and Marno directed by Nowrasteh. The violence of bad religion in that film will be even more real if you have images to hang words on as you read.A companion read I'd recommend with this book is The Purity Myth by a young, 4th wave feminist, Jessica Valente. Like The Stoning of Soraya M., the focus of the purity mongers (usually men) remains women and almost always mixes in religion. Bad religion. And of course politics. Purity rants always get around to being about sex--female sexuality and the purity of women. This was certainly the theme in that small village outside Tehran three decades back during post-revolution Iran. The author uses fictional names for the people and the town for obvious reasons but the work reads like journalism. Sahebjam describes himself, in fact, as a journalist and a theologian.Through the introduction and book jacket you'll learn that some 1500 women have been stoned in the last twenty five years in the Middle East. OK, some men were stoned, too. But not many. Mostly it's women and mostly death dished up around the purity concept, around evil, around sin. Yes, religious purity. And honor. Family or town honor. Far more effective and powerful than simply the us/them theme which serves as the engine of most wars. If you fancy yourself spiritual or religious and you have doubt about the price of walking down the purity road, read the story of Soraya. And I'd advise against the temptation of seeing this problem as only an Islam thing. It was for me far more than that. For me this book was about those who say they want purity. Not theirs, of course, but mine. And about a culture which does not value purity of heart so much as superficial, legalistic purity so often aimed at others and specifically, women. My takeaway from this book: reaching for purity sinlessness anywhere but in your own heart and life will lead to death most every time. Indeed, who can throw a stone but a man or woman truly pure within.In this book it's the men who throw the stones, of course. Not a pretty story line. But just as many women stood by and let it happen. No woman in that town but Soraya's aunt paid the price of speaking up. Silence remains a bloody stone as well.One could go on and on about the price of trying to bring back 7th century Islam. Instead, read this book if you've ever gone to confession in your church and forgotten how you judged someone else rather other than yourself, judged them as sinful or impure. Soraya's story indeed brought back for me the fear of freedom thing that Jack Nicholson's character showed us in Dennis Hooper's Easy Rider classic, how an us/them deadly hate thing was alive in the South, how it flowered in a mortal wound of more than just Captain America back in the day. The same hate is alive and well now, of course.I don't mean to soft peddle real problems with Islam. In Egypt, where 90% are Muslims and 10% Christians, in recent months and weeks Eastern Orthodox Copts have been shot (monks even) and killed; and 84% of the population in Egypt today still believes if one converts from Islam to Christianity he deserves to be executed. Of course stoning is the ancient way to get the job done here.It's been 30 years since Soraya's brutal death in Iran at the hands of 250 religious people in her village. There's a picture of her in this book. Read it for her and the white dress she wore that day. You'll feel awful but at the same time better.

He interviews her aunt Zarah, to gather what happened. Zarah a courageous woman who tried to protect her niece , even demanding the Islamist rabble stone her, rather than Soraya, a mother of young children.The ends scones in particular are particularly painful to watch and only a psychopath could remain unmoved.Thousands of women are and girls even as young as nine stoned to death in Iran for 'sexual immorality' every year and it is happening today, Who will have the humanity to speak out against it and support action.But most disturbing of all is the reaction of the Western hard left to this movie and all other evidence of the horrors commited in Islamic coutnries, dissmeninating the vile party line that it is all propaganda to boost 'Western imperialism.' and the so-called oppression of Muslims.This is absolutely sickening. Typical of a leftwing radicals! they defend Iranian IslamoFascism and mass murder and horrific oppression of women because they are anti-West and therefore to be championed . Being privileged to live in societies which grant women  choice and values their lives ,  but brainwashed by their college professors to support Islamic atrocities, they feel no compassion for the real victims of such terror. Sad that the modern left has come to this.Of course only the problems that bother Western leftists (like 'Palestine' and American and British 'Imperialism') should  be highlighted.

1317141,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0031DDG9U,Grady Harp,"[4, 4]","There is a telling quotation placed on the screen before this visceral film begins: 'Don't act like the hypocrite, who thinks he can conceal his wiles while  loudly quoting the Koran.' The words are translated from the 14th century Persian poet Hafez. What follows is a magnificently reenactment of a true story of an incident in 1986 Iran as captured in a book by Freidoune Sahebjam. THE STONING OF SORAYA M. is one of those films that once seen become indelibly imprinted in both memory and emotions. It is adapted from Sahebjam's book by writer/director Cyrus Nowrasteh and Betsy Griffen Nowrasteh and a more powerful indictment of man's cruelty to man under the false guise of 'religious belief' would be difficult to imagine.The story opens with French-speaking Freidoune Sahebjam (James Caviezel) towed into the nearest town after his automobile breaks down.  He pleads with the town mechanic Hashem (Parviz Sayyad) to fix his car and pays him well.  While having tea in a nearby teahouse he is approached by a distraught woman who has just discovered fragments of cloth and bones remaining after the dogs have devoured her niece the night before.  The woman is Zahra (the luminous, brilliant Shohreh Aghdashloo) and hearing that Freidoune is a journalist, she convinces him to come to her home so that she can tell her story she feels the world must hear.  Freidoune consents and begins to tape record the story of the film.Soraya M. (Mozhan Marn&ograve;) is married to an abusive and adulterous husband Ali (Navid Negahban) and though Soraya cares for her four children and her home she is beaten and abused by Ali.  Ali tells her he wants his freedom to marry a very young teenage girl with whom he is having an affair, but Soraya fears her destiny as a single mother with no source of income.  She denies divorce, and Ali approaches the town Mullah (Ali Pourtash) and the mayor of the city Ebrahim (David Diaan) that Soraya is unfaithful and should be stoned to death.  Meanwhile Soraya's aunt Zahra is called to the deathbed of Hashem's beloved wife and tends to the body preparation for burial.  Hashem is devastated, wondering how he will be able to raise his son and maintain a house without his wife.  The Mullah and the Mayor ask Soraya to tend to Hashem's household chores and care for the son, a task she agrees to with the bargaining power of Zahra. But Ali, desperate to be relieved of his obligations to Soraya, lies about his wife's fidelity, accusing her of being a prostitute with Hashem.  Ali, Mullah, and Mayor consult with Hashem who breaks down and promises to lie about Soraya's behavior.  Soraya is condemned to stoning by the city for her sins against the Koran and in a heartbreaking scene she is buried up to her waist, and the town (including her own children) stone her to death.  Her body is denied burial and she is taken by the women of the town to the river bank, the place where the day Freidoune  arrives Zahra has just discovered Soraya's pitiful remains.  Freidoune is deeply touched by the story and promises Zahra to publish it - a feat that is threatened by the men behind the cruel lies that lead to the death of the innocent Soraya.  Obviously the book was written and is thus shared in this compelling drama.The cinematography by Joel Ransom is brilliant, capturing the sun bleached hovels of the town, harsh by day but stunning by sunset and sunrise, and showing enough of the stoning to make the audience feel the event without sensationalizing it.  The subtle musical score is John Debney.  Though the acting honors are rightfully centered on the gifted Shohreh Aghdashloo, the entire cast is flawless - from the angst embodied by Mozhan Marn&ograve; to the quintessential evil of the character created by Navid Negahban and the pitiful soul destruction exemplified by Parviz Sayyad.  This is a near perfect film, one that deserves wide attention not only for its brilliance of execution, but for the harrowing tale it reveals to the world - an act of stoning of women that still exists in many cultures.

1317148,A1NX0436LKD1Q0,B0031DDG9U,"Jon Stevens ""Journalist""","[5, 14]","This great film should be seen by every American so they will know the kind of barbaric enemy we face, but it will not happen because it's not Batman, Spiderman, or Transformers. Americans live in a fantasy Toys 'R' Us la-la land of denial, distracted by the economy, unemployment, shrinking wealth, health coverage, and other issues, etc. They want to be entertained, not be forced to think as this intelligent film forces its audience to do. Any American seeing this film will realize that women in Muslim countries (Iran in the film) are treated worse than dogs are in the United States. Women have no rights. They can be stoned to death, a most brutal, barbaric, and horrible slow execution for women even just ""suspected"" of adultery, or as in this film, a wife's murder by stoning is instigated by a scumbag of an Iranian-Muslim husband wishing to be rid of her, mother of his 4 children, so he can be free to marry a 14 year old girl. He even places the stones in the hands of his two young sons, one of which strikes his mother in the center of her forehead, that's how cruel these miserable people are. America is playing games with Iran, and we will pay a price. The UN (owned by the Arabs oil cartel), the leftist media, all say Saddam didn't have WMD and Bush lied. Duh? Saddam was no jerk. He sent his weapons of mass destruction to Syria, so Americans will drive themselves crazy with guilt, like in the latest film Green Zone, with all kinds of moronic Hollywood theories. We are very naive, and idealistic idiots, while our Muslim enemies are cunning, and ruthless. We are endangered, but refuse to recognize it thanks to our ""political correctness"" folly. We will pay. Our children will pay.Americans have been brainwashed by American-Islamic organizations (mostly serving covertly as fronts for terrorism) to believe that Muslims are victimized by Western civilization, Zionists stole the land of Palestine, and that Islam is a ""religion of peace"". All cunning lies, part of the Islamic ""taqiyya"" (strategy of deception allowed when dealing with infidels), but when you watch this courageous powerful film, you will shudder at the brutality perpetrated in the name of Allah, and the blood curdling Islamic war cry Allahu Akbar will send waves of fear through your veins, and justly so. The pilots who flew the planes into the World Trade Center murdering 3,000 innocent American civilians on 9/11 shouted that terrible war cry. Palestinian suicide bombers of innocent civilians in Israel, Palestinian murderers of 100,000 Christian civilians in Lebanon, Muslim insurgents in Iraq, Islamic terrorists all over the world, and as you will see in this film, the cold-blooded killers of Soroya, shout Allahu Akbar as they stone her to death. It's shocking to watch, but this is no fiction. It's an act of murder carried out daily in Muslim countries sanctioned by their demented imams and racist Qur'an (114 suras and over 6,300 verses that I've read).This film is beautifully acted, beautifully filmed, locations exotic, and its music haunting. I recommend it highly. It should be screened in all American schools and colleges to counter the powerful Arab PR. The filmmakers are very courageous having made this film which is so critical of Islam. I won't be surprised if there is a price on their heads, just as the Dutch filmmaker who was murdered.When the film was over I said to my wife, the Israelis are heroic! Imagine, surrounded by these blood thirsty Muslim enemies sworn to their extermination,  supported by the Arab bought UN, leftist world media, anti-Semites, Nazis, and Jewish liberal or ultra-religious Brooklyn Hassdic fanatics, and yet they prevail. Thank God they are strong and armed protected by their valiant Israel Defense Forces (IDF) young boys and girls serving their homeland with honor. Yes, they have paid a dear price (22,000 have fallen in defense of Israel), yet they prevail. And thank God they are led by ex-elite commando Natanyahu, most articulate, charismatic Israeli leader ever. If Israelis were weak, they all would have been butchered a long time in the name of Allah.Congratulations to the filmmakers for this amazing film.",5,Every American should see this film,1269129600,"03 21, 2010",2010,4179,"['great', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'American', 'will', 'know', 'kind', 'barbaric', 'enemy', 'face', 'will', 'not', 'happen', 'not', 'Batman', 'Spiderman', 'Transformers', 'Americans', 'live', 'fantasy', 'Toys', 'R', 'Us', 'la-la', 'land', 'denial', 'distracted', 'economy', 'unemployment', 'shrinking', 'wealth', 'health', 'coverage', 'other', 'issues', 'etc', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'not', 'be', 'forced', 'think', 'intelligent', 'film', 'audience', 'do', 'Any', 'American', 'seeing', 'film', 'will', 'realize', 'women', 'Muslim', 'countries', 'Iran', 'film', 'are', 'treated', 'worse', 'dogs', 'are', 'United', 'States', 'Women', 'have', 'rights', 'can', 'be', 'stoned', 'death', 'most', 'brutal', 'barbaric', 'horrible', 'slow', 'execution', 'women', 'even', 'just', 'suspected', 'adultery', 'as', 'film', 'wife', 'murder', 'stoning', 'instigated', 'scumbag', 'Iranian-Muslim', 'husband', 'wishing', 'be', 'rid', 'mother', '4', 'children', 'can', 'be', 'free', 'marry', '14', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'even', 'stones', 'hands', 'two', 'young', 'sons', 'one', 'mother', 'center', 'forehead', 'how', 'cruel', 'miserable', 'people', 'are', 'America', 'playing', 'games', 'Iran', 'will', 'pay', 'price', 'UN', 'owned', 'Arabs', 'oil', 'cartel', 'leftist', 'media', 'say', 'Saddam', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'WMD', 'Bush', 'lied', 'Duh', 'Saddam', 'was', 'jerk', 'sent', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'Syria', 'so', 'Americans', 'will', 'drive', 'crazy', 'guilt', 'latest', 'film', 'Green', 'Zone', 'kinds', 'moronic', 'Hollywood', 'theories', 'are', 'very', 'naive', 'idealistic', 'idiots', 'Muslim', 'enemies', 'are', 'cunning', 'ruthless', 'are', 'endangered', 'refuse', 'recognize', 'political', 'correctness', 'folly', 'will', 'pay', 'children', 'will', 'pay.Americans', 'have', 'been', 'brainwashed', 'American-Islamic', 'organizations', 'mostly', 'serving', 'covertly', 'fronts', 'terrorism', 'believe', 'Muslims', 'are', 'victimized', 'Western', 'civilization', 'stole', 'land', 'Palestine', 'Islam', 'religion', 'peace', 'cunning', 'lies', 'part', 'Islamic', 'taqiyya', 'strategy', 'deception', 'allowed', 'when', 'dealing', 'infidels', 'when', 'watch', 'courageous', 'powerful', 'film', 'will', 'shudder', 'brutality', 'perpetrated', 'name', 'Allah', 'blood', 'curdling', 'Islamic', 'war', 'cry', 'Allahu', 'Akbar', 'will', 'send', 'waves', 'fear', 'veins', 'justly', 'so', 'pilots', 'who', 'flew', 'planes', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'murdering', '3,000', 'innocent', 'American', 'civilians', '9/11', 'shouted', 'terrible', 'war', 'cry', 'Palestinian', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'innocent', 'civilians', 'Israel', 'Palestinian', 'murderers', '100,000', 'Christian', 'civilians', 'Lebanon', 'Muslim', 'insurgents', 'Iraq', 'Islamic', 'world', 'will', 'see', 'film', 'cold-blooded', 'killers', 'Soroya', 'shout', 'Allahu', 'Akbar', 'stone', 'death', 'shocking', 'watch', 'fiction', 'act', 'murder', 'carried', 'out', 'daily', 'Muslim', 'countries', 'sanctioned', 'demented', 'imams', 'racist', ""Qur'an"", '114', 'suras', '6,300', 'verses', ""'ve"", 'read', '.This', 'film', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'locations', 'exotic', 'music', 'haunting', 'recommend', 'highly', 'should', 'be', 'screened', 'American', 'schools', 'colleges', 'counter', 'powerful', 'Arab', 'PR', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'very', 'courageous', 'having', 'made', 'film', 'so', 'critical', 'Islam', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'price', 'heads', 'just', 'Dutch', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'was', 'murdered.When', 'film', 'was', 'said', 'wife', 'Israelis', 'are', 'heroic', 'Imagine', 'surrounded', 'blood', 'thirsty', 'Muslim', 'sworn', 'extermination', 'supported', 'Arab', 'bought', 'UN', 'leftist', 'world', 'media', 'anti-Semites', 'Nazis', 'Jewish', 'liberal', 'ultra-religious', 'Brooklyn', 'Hassdic', 'fanatics', 'yet', 'prevail', 'Thank', 'God', 'are', 'strong', 'armed', 'protected', 'valiant', 'Israel', 'Defense', 'Forces', 'IDF', 'young', 'boys', 'girls', 'serving', 'homeland', 'honor', 'Yes', 'have', 'paid', 'dear', 'price', '22,000', 'have', 'fallen', 'defense', 'Israel', 'yet', 'prevail', 'thank', 'God', 'are', 'led', 'ex-elite', 'commando', 'Natanyahu', 'most', 'articulate', 'charismatic', 'Israeli', 'leader', 'ever', 'Israelis', 'were', 'weak', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'butchered', 'long', 'time', 'name', 'Allah.Congratulations', 'filmmakers', 'amazing', 'film']",The Stoning of Soraya M.

1317150,A282SV3AIUE154,B0031DDG9U,"K. Feucht ""OncoDoc""","[1, 3]","his is a bad movie to watch late at night, as it will haunt you. It is the story of a young wife in a small village in Iran, as told through the voice of a journalist who was passing through the village. Apparently, it was based on a true story, as this story mirrors what happens many times throughout strict Muslim countries. Soraya is mother of two young boys and two young girls, but whose husband has found her to be less than satisfactory, in spite of her hard work and virtue. He decides to get rid of her and marry another girl in a neighbor village. She takes up the job of helping to care for the children of a neighbor widower, encouraged by the town officials and holy man. Through this, the town officials and holy man assist in devising a false trumped charge of adultery. The widower is threatened with his life if he fails to assist in this plot, and so contributes to the deception of the charge of adultery, attesting that she was found lying on his bed. The final verdict was the death penalty, and all men in the village, including Soraya's sons throw stones. Justice is finally served when Soraya's husband discovers that the other girl is not available to him and he is left without a wife, and that the journalist brings the story to the rest of the world.The intention of this movie is to alert the western world as to the mistreatment of women in Muslim countries. The film inadvertently portrays a much deeper evil that lurks throughout the Muslim mindset, which unfortunately is turned into a virtue by the Muslim faith. In the Judeo-Christian ethic, a person that leads to the death of another in a trial by bearing false witness is also condemned to death (Deut. 19:15-20). Integrity and truth are considered integral to religion and worship of God. In the Muslim faith, the worship of Allah is divorced from the ethical environment. A hierarchy of values are generated whereby one evil may justify the performance of another evil.Thus, suicidal terrorist acts, the organized mistreatment of women, the debauchery that occurs in all Muslim countries are all condoned since the ends justify the means. My experience of having spent time in several Muslim countries (Bangladesh and Northern Africa) confirm this through observations of women essentially having the same social status as animals. This is not superficially observable as many Muslim men treated their wives with respect, even though they still remain second class citizens in the society. Attempts have been made to accuse Western society for demeaning women, yet, the difference is such that females are considered equal but different, contrary to feminist ideology that considers females not only equal but not different. Either is a far cry from the Muslim world, where a female might be imprisoned for driving a car, or speaking out in public.The director of this movie did a brilliant job of character development, scene portrayal, and plot flow. It will hold you by the seat of your pants, in spite of the fact that I have just given away the plot of the movie.

At the risk of her own life, the aunt of Soraya M. made contact with the journalist to tell the story of her niece in hopes that it would make it to the outside world. It reveals a dark side of Islamic culture and the deep prejudice against women and the double standard they allow for men against women. As horrific as this story is, it is too easy to sit in judgment of these people for what they did. This is a difficult film to watch on the order of THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST for its brutality to an innocent person. We end up asking the same questions - how could, family, friends and neighbors allow this, let alone take part in this horrific act?  Yet, we look at our society and the racial discrimination that produced equally violent acts towards fellow Americans.  How is that societies end up dehumanizing certain segments of the human race, whether by gender, race or religious belief?  How do ordinary people end up being murderers and incredibly violent?

It left me wanting to know more about Zahra, what happened to her? The actual stoning of Soraya, Zahra's niece, occurred within a 24 hour period of when the journalist came to town. For Zahra to have verbally conveyed all of this information in such a short amount of time, it's amazing. What happened to Zahra? Did the village idiots stone her as well? I didnt have a chance to watch the extra features on the dvd, perhaps my answer was there.I felt the movie was well done because it captured the mindless frenzy and bloodlust that you would think a crowd of idiots would have. Because you have to be an idiot to stand by and participate, cheer on, and watch a woman being pelted with stones until she's dead. When you watch TV and you see riots or people going berserk as a crowd, when you watch pandemonium on the news....the director of this movie captured that crazy, bloodlust, sicko mentality. It's craziness.There is a saying that water is more powerful than a stone, and in this movie, I felt that Zahra in this case was the feminine energy in the village. And when confronted with masculine energy, how could she fight masculine energy one on one? How does water fight rock? It doesnt, it finds another path, and that's what Zahra did.  Zahra's resolve in knowing right from wrong, that moment of truth and clarity (I believe she had to have had it), is what made her more powerful in the end.At the end of the movie, my question as an audience was, what can I do?

Having said that, I'm glad I did and I'm glad the book was written and the film made.  The story takes place in mid 80's Iran.  That's 1980's but it could have been 1180 for all we know.  I'm guessing not much is different except for a few automobiles.  The story is about Soraya (Mozhan Marno), the scorned wife of a prison guard.  He wants to take up with the 14 year old daughter of a prisoner he's been bartering with.  That's all cool in Iran except his wife won't willingly give him a divorce because he threatens to take their 2 sons, leaving her with the 2 daughters and no way to make a living.  The guard along with the local mullah and mayor concoct a plan to frame Soraya for adultery, a capital offense in Iran.  With no evidence, she's found guilty and sentenced to death by stoning.  A previous Oscar nominee, Shohreh Aghdashloo plays Soraya's aunt Zahra and tries to protect her.  She's a wonderful actress has had several great roles.  I'm sure as an Iranian American, this one must have hit home.  It shows.  The movie lingers on the stoning scene which gives it a very authentic, if gut wrenching finale.

1317166,A2QDD6OWIAEBED,B0031DDG9U,"Paul Aragon ""krakatoa1883""","[7, 8]","Around a year ago, I wrote a review about a film that dissapointed me greatly called An American Crime starring Ellen Page. It tried to tackle the true story of Sylvia Likens, a teenage girl that was abused to death by a grotesque pack mentality of adults and kids back in 1965 Indianapolis. I accused the film and the director of lacking the guts to dispaly the abuse realistically, and subsequently, taking what was very serious subject matter, and depicting it with all the limpness of boiled bacon. My review was objective to a fault, and examined the shortcomings of that picture with stark informative detail, while utilizing my own brand of brash humor. The name of that review was called ""Pussyfoot"" which pretty much summed up An American Crime's production team. For many readers, this boldness on my part didn't go over very well.In the months that fallowed, the comment box filled up with all kinds of hateful negative feedback. People where telling me what a sick man I was, how they hoped I never had children, and how I needed to have my head examined. It is truly a surreal feeling to have other people point fingers at you, while acting like they are morally superior then you are. All this because I said that that particular movie compromised its intentions by trying to skirt the issue. The point to this is, is that I wasn't wrong. I just didn't clearly state the full point that I was trying to make. Thankfully, The Stoning Of Soraya M. has come along and completed the puzzle for me.There are some stories that when objectified onto film, demand a director with the innovation and guts to boldly display harsh reality and truth without any fear of how it might effect the viewer. This impasse comes about when the subject matter is no longer about entertainment. That is the key point here. That is the difference between The Stoning Of Soraya M. and most other movies. That is why this movie works so well and is in my eyes, one of the absolute best two or three film of its entire decade. It is also why An American Crime will be no more then a forgotten footnote in the annals of movie history. The subject matter in The Stoning Of Soraya M. goes well beyond 99.9% of what all other film is for, entertainment. It therefor has to be depicted like what it is...Real.Now a couple of brief disclaimers.I can only imagine how upsetting this film must be for Islamic people. Having a nasty secret like a culture who's most ardent believers still practice and condone stoning in these modern times goes far beyond merely having a pink elephant in the room. The point of this film is not to blindly condemn Islam, but to condemn any and all sick atrocities that dare to insult humanity is such a blantantly foul way. However, it is my humble opinion that more Islamic people need to get in the game and shout down their extremists and put pressure on them to change their ways. As a westerner, just don't go into this picture through the eyes of Islamophobia. Instead, we should all be thankful that this feature exists with the harsh bare truth that it does, because it is making a demand for change with unflinching guts. It is fighting for what is right, and depicting it the right way. The only way that it possibly can.My second disclaimer is this. Know that I am a full blown ceniphile with over 1,000 DVD's in my private collection. I am also a seasoned fan of horror and exploitation films. I see violence displayed in film all the time. I have seen all sorts of people die on film in all sorts of amazing and bizarre ways, but not even a life time of digesting the most disturbing cinematic moments known to man kind prepaired me for the death scene in The Stoning Of Soraya M. I suspected this was going to rough going in, that was why I didn't bother to even take the plastic off the the DVD until five days after it arrived on my doorstep. The very idea of a person getting stoned to death on screen was a bigger pill then my mind was willing to swallow. I didn't even want to imagine how rough this was going to be. The truth is, that the depiction of the horrifying event in The Stoning Of Soraya M. not only exceeded the most dreadful images I could ever of conjured in my minds eye, but it was ten times worse then anything I would have dared to imagine. What I didn't take into account going in, was the level of acting by Mozhan Marno' who played Soraya M. What she was capable of conveying with just one look from a single facial expression, shatters nearly all the acting that I have ever seen come out of Hollywood. I still get chills down my spine just picturing her in that scene. On top of this, the directing during that sequence was done with such brilliance, care, and boldness, that this is easily the most devistating death scene ever crafted in the history of cinema. I say this without the least bit of exaggeration. This subject matter that was beyond mere entertainment demanded a director with the guts to depict its harshest moments with truth, and by God this story found one in Cyrus Nowrasteh. I won't ruin this by telling you what takes place, but just be warned...It doesn't get any realer then this.The story itself is very simple and is told in a most concise direct manner. Despite the film being mostly subtitled, you shouldn't have any problems fallowing along since things are so smooth and streamlined. What makes this such a rich rewarding cinematic experience is that the film shows so many levels of human behavior with such stark clairity. Since the poor people in this tiny Iranian village have to scrape their existence off of rock and rubble, they act in all kinds of different ways when opportunity presents itself to them. Some do petty things, like trying to steal the feminine belongings from a grieving man who just lost his wife, while others show remarkable dignity and courage in the face of the hardships and personal mistakes. I would be hard pressed to conjure up another film that showed this level of clearly drawn humanity. Mike Leigh's Naked comes to mind, as does The Magdalene Sisters, and film classics like Cool Hand Luke, and Dog Day Afternoon, but it indeed rare these days.When I look back into the experience that is this feature, I really can not see where any of the flaws are. There is not a single moment that drags or feels unnecessary. Every character is authentic and three dimentional, the dialogue meaninful and profound, and the cinematography glorious. I don't know what else to say except that I have to thank everyone involved in this film for not being afraid of the subject matter. Thanks to them, I now know for sure that I am not the jadded monster that my commenter's on my Pussyfoot review where saying I was. Thanks to the production team who made The Stoning Of Soraya M. I now know that I am completely human.This film is absolutely wonderful and essential.

It shows the darker aspects of humanity - such as the cruelty of gossips, the rage of a misogynistic pedophile, and oppressive traditions that no longer make sense, yet are revered far more than humanity.  What I liked about this movie is that the tragedy is no overly done and that the main characters don't take this punishment, they fight for Soraya's life.  It was well acted and well written, I felt so much compassion for the main characters Soraya (Mozhan Marno) and her aunt Zahra (Shohreh Aghdashloo)I nearly cried.  The actor who played Ali (Navid Negahban), the husband of Soraya, was an excellent villain.  He managed to capture his cruelty and hatred for her, it was horrifying to watch.  The Stoning of Soraya M is not a movie I would recommend to everyone as it would be very difficult for many to digest many of the scenes in this movie.

The crime is one that's been carried out repeatedly by humanity against one another for all sorts of man made reasons, including sacrifices to their Gods.  The depiction was so real and engrossing that I and others watching forgot we were reading english subtitles.At times we are all victims of cowardice. But tomorrows are meant for courageously righting the wrongs of cowardly acts.  The story of Soraya M. will hopefully give strength and courage to bystanders witnessing and/or participating in tomorrows' wrongs.
