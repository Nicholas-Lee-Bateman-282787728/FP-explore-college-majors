Anyone who remembers the Original School House Rock, will love this compilation and any others.

These little 3 minute jewels were and still are GREAT. How else would you have learned your  multiplication tables, or learned the Preamble. You owe it to yourself, to  take a trip down memory lane, to a time when things were simple and fun. If  you have kids, buy these tapes. They will love them, and you will love them  also.

But, you have to realize, they were never meant to be. Our text books in school are not 100% accurate either. SHR was never meant to be 100% accurate. It was created to make kids think, and present the material in a way where it would be fun. Yes, alot is left out, but alot more is in there also. Im am so sick of people trying to be so POLITICALLY CORRECT these days. GET OVER IT, and just accept School House Rock for what it is.

There, in our twenties, all of us could well remember the music and lyrics.  Taking these songs off the air was the worst decision for Saturday morning cartoons ever made.  They are fun, educational, memorable, instructive and their goal is not to get a parent to buy something (well, that explains why they are no longer on the air regularly).  I loved them as a 5, 6, 7 year old and have never stopped (along with the majority of my generation).  In fact, when I sat through my law school class about how a bill becomes a law I could not get the &quot;I am a Bill&quot; song out of my head and every time I hear someone describe a verb without using an adverb I have to wonder, did they ever see Lolly?",5,Still As Good As I Remember,1037750400,"11 20, 2002",2002,828,"['Back', '1988', 'when', 'was', 'college', 'sat', 'dining', 'hall', 'one', 'night', 'sang', 'School', 'House', 'Rock', 'songs', 'other', 'twenties', 'could', 'well', 'remember', 'music', 'lyrics', 'Taking', 'songs', 'air', 'was', 'worst', 'decision', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoons', 'ever', 'made', 'are', 'fun', 'educational', 'memorable', 'instructive', 'goal', 'not', 'get', 'parent', 'buy', 'something', 'well', 'why', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'air', 'regularly', 'loved', '5', '6', '7', 'year', 'old', 'have', 'never', 'stopped', 'majority', 'generation', 'fact', 'when', 'sat', 'law', 'school', 'class', 'how', 'bill', 'law', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'quot', 'am', 'Bill', 'quot', 'head', 'time', 'hear', 'someone', 'describe', 'verb', 'using', 'adverb', 'have', 'wonder', 'did', 'ever', 'see', 'Lolly']",N/A
