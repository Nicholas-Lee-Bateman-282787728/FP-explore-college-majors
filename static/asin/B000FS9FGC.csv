994778,AG979D138UTRJ,B000FS9FGC,A. P. Stafford,"[4, 7]","This has a great concept.  A group of undercover operatives, posing as a company that designs and makes swimwear, run around the tropics blasting away with guns.  What could be more fun than babes in bikinis running around with guns and blowing things up?Great concept, but what about the execution?Well let's look at the cast.  There are nine regulars, of which only three are women.  What?  Well, I suppose Fabio thinks he is pretty.  The leading lady is Catherine Oxenberg.  OK, she is good looking, but she doesn't have the figure of a bikini babe and they rightly keep her awsy from bikinis.  In fact, of the nine cast members, only Alison Armitage is really bikini babe material, and she just doesn't spend long enough on camera.So far, so bad.So do they have a lot of bikini parades, bikini contests, bad girls with guns running around in bikinis?  They did in the first episode and I thought that was a pretty good start.  But it was all downhill from there.  In fact, about half a dozen episodes into the series there is a swimsuit show in which the models are almost all men.  Yuck!  I think they have missed their target audience here.Is there any saving grace?  Well, you don't expect this to have a Shakespearian script and you don't get one either.  The banter between the leading man, Brendan Kelly, and Catherine Oxenberg is actually embarrasing.  The acting is wooden.  The plots are unoriginal.And I think either the cameramen didn't know how to focus the cameras or they steamed up in the tropical heat (or both).  The lack of focus is made even worse by the poor DVD transfer.  This really kills what little babe value this had left.So does it have anything at all going for it.  Well yes.  It is good, clean fun.  A bit of bang, bang, shoot-em-up.  And the goodies always win.  And Alison Armitage is in it and some other girls occasionally wander past looking good in bikinis, even if they are a bit of a blur.So how many stars is it really worth?  About three.  So why did I give it five?  So that Amazon's computer system whould recommend other action programmes or movies with girls in bikinis (if they come along).If you are in to that sort of thing, I strongly suggest any of the Andy Sidaris productions.",5,Why did I give this five stars?,1192579200,"10 17, 2007",2007,2232,"['great', 'concept', 'group', 'undercover', 'operatives', 'posing', 'company', 'swimwear', 'run', 'tropics', 'blasting', 'away', 'guns', 'What', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'fun', 'babes', 'bikinis', 'running', 'around', 'guns', 'blowing', 'things', 'up', 'Great', 'concept', 'what', 'execution', 'Well', 'let', 'look', 'cast', 'are', 'nine', 'regulars', 'only', 'three', 'are', 'women', 'What', 'Well', 'suppose', 'Fabio', 'thinks', 'pretty', 'leading', 'lady', 'Catherine', 'Oxenberg', 'OK', 'good', 'looking', ""n't"", 'have', 'figure', 'bikini', 'babe', 'rightly', 'keep', 'awsy', 'bikinis', 'fact', 'nine', 'cast', 'members', 'only', 'Alison', 'Armitage', 'really', 'bikini', 'babe', 'material', 'just', ""n't"", 'spend', 'long', 'enough', 'camera.So', 'far', 'bad.So', 'do', 'have', 'lot', 'bikini', 'parades', 'bikini', 'contests', 'bad', 'girls', 'guns', 'running', 'around', 'bikinis', 'did', 'first', 'episode', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'start', 'was', 'downhill', 'there', 'fact', 'dozen', 'series', 'swimsuit', 'show', 'models', 'are', 'almost', 'men', 'Yuck', 'think', 'have', 'missed', 'target', 'audience', 'here.Is', 'there', 'saving', 'grace', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'have', 'Shakespearian', 'script', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'one', 'banter', 'leading', 'man', 'Brendan', 'Kelly', 'Catherine', 'Oxenberg', 'actually', 'embarrasing', 'acting', 'wooden', 'plots', 'are', 'unoriginal.And', 'think', 'cameramen', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'focus', 'cameras', 'steamed', 'up', 'tropical', 'heat', 'lack', 'focus', 'made', 'even', 'worse', 'poor', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'really', 'what', 'little', 'babe', 'value', 'had', 'left.So', 'have', 'anything', 'going', 'Well', 'yes', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'bit', 'bang', 'bang', 'shoot-em-up', 'goodies', 'always', 'win', 'Alison', 'Armitage', 'other', 'girls', 'occasionally', 'wander', 'past', 'looking', 'good', 'bikinis', 'even', 'are', 'bit', 'blur.So', 'how', 'many', 'stars', 'really', 'worth', 'three', 'why', 'did', 'give', 'five', 'Amazon', 'computer', 'system', 'whould', 'recommend', 'other', 'action', 'programmes', 'movies', 'girls', 'bikinis', 'come', 'along', 'are', 'sort', 'thing', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'Andy', 'Sidaris', 'productions']",N/A

I bought this series because Michael Worth is one of my favorite karate movie stars, so I knew their would be action in this series. I got way more than my money's worth. I remember the beautiful Katherine Oxenberg from  80s nighttime series juggernaut Dynasty. The sexual tension between Oxenberg's Ahley, the head of this undercover team of espionage fighters  and Brendan Kelly's Mike was great. Considering that this was after the sexual tension thing had been done to death by Moonlighting's Dave and Maddie, Wings' Hellen and Joe, and Cheer's Sam and Diane, among other ""almost couples"", this was still refreshing. Every episode was exciting, fun, action packed with a  hint of romance, whether it was Ashley and Mike, or the other undercover team beauties and beaus. Looking back, this series was new , refreshing and well worth viewing.  The beauties are not bubbleheads. The beaus are not muslceheads. The episodes are actually interesting, attention-grabbing  and action packed with the changing  tropical locals only adding to the excitement. The Charlie's Angel like ""mysterieous boss belching out missions from a foreign local"" was done well, with the unique voice and face of actor John Vernon as Mr. Smith. My only problem with this series is- ""What happened to it?"" Two seasons and gone, and most of the original cast did not come back for the second season , including Oxenberg and Kelly. That would be like Dallas without J.R and Bobby Ewing.  I really would like to know what happened. The possibilities for this show to go at least five or six seasons were endless.The concept of this show  would be good for a remake today, either with the same cast or new members. The show may've went Missing In Action, but it certainly was not missing a lot of action.

This is the show I could never understand why it was never followed up with a season 3, 4 and 5.  Great escapism fun, good looking women, a few young bucks and plenty of great scenery to look at.In season one you have a different and much larger cast (season two would only include Michael Worth and Alison Armitage - two of the more interesting personalities on the show) than the final season.  It includes Catherine Oxenberg, John Vernon and even Fabio in a few select episodes.  Doesn't look like there are many extras on the disc so hopefully they'll get smart and season two will include some cast commentaries or something.

One of the most under rated tv shows of the 90's makes its way to DVD! AND A NICE SET AT THAT! Mill Creek did a real nice job on this box set. Disks are all 1 sided, nice box art and information about the show, Plus behind the seens interviews and more! Season 1 is without a doubt the BEST OF HEAT and featuring the original All-Star cast. Acapulco HEAT aired in 1993 and lasted 1 season, Then out of nowhere in 1998 Acapulco HEAT returns for season 2 this time only 2 members of the original cast remain. While it was nice to see the HEAT back on tv and I did watch season 2 it was just not the same still good though. If you have never seen the show before I highly recommend it!
