Considering this is twice as long, there is even more information packed into here. Deepak Chopra's 7 Spiritual Laws are:- Pure Potentiality- Giving and Receiving- Karma (there is- Least Effort- Intention and Desire- Detachment- Dharma (Purpose of Life)The first half, the Seven Laws, is actually a recording of a lecture he gave. There are some good details here that back up his other video and enhances the overall lesson.The second half, Crystal Cave, is another recorded lecture that involves the teachings of Merlin. The teachings are valuable, and really drive home the 7 Spiritual Laws. Everyone has an inner ""Wizard"" or spirit that knows the truth about life and existence. What is necessary is for us to tap into that wizard. Just like with the other video, this is a good place to start your self-development/spiritual journey but it is not complete in and of itself. If you are interested, this will lead you to seek out more sources which I suggest you do as your journey should not entirely rely on one resource alone.",5,A Double Feature,1300838400,"03 23, 2011",2011,1162,"['Prior', 'watching', 'watchedThe', 'Seven', 'Spiritual', 'Laws', 'Successand', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'get', 'anything', 'new', 'video', 'Considering', 'twice', 'as', 'long', 'even', 'more', 'information', 'packed', 'here', 'Deepak', 'Chopra', '7', 'Spiritual', 'Laws', 'are', 'Pure', 'Potentiality-', 'Giving', 'Receiving-', 'Karma', 'is-', 'Least', 'Effort-', 'Intention', 'Desire-', 'Detachment-', 'Dharma', 'Purpose', 'Life', 'first', 'half', 'Seven', 'Laws', 'actually', 'recording', 'lecture', 'gave', 'are', 'good', 'details', 'here', 'back', 'up', 'other', 'video', 'overall', 'lesson.The', 'second', 'half', 'Crystal', 'Cave', 'recorded', 'lecture', 'teachings', 'Merlin', 'teachings', 'are', 'valuable', 'really', 'drive', 'home', '7', 'Spiritual', 'Laws', 'Everyone', 'inner', 'Wizard', 'spirit', 'truth', 'life', 'existence', 'What', 'necessary', 'tap', 'wizard', 'Just', 'other', 'video', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'self-development/spiritual', 'journey', 'not', 'complete', 'are', 'interested', 'will', 'lead', 'seek', 'out', 'more', 'sources', 'suggest', 'do', 'journey', 'should', 'not', 'entirely', 'rely', 'one', 'resource', 'alone']",Deepak Chopra: Seven Spiritual Laws/Crystal Cave
553669,A3KQ5Q90X2ZCLV,B00004W45B,"Lynda. Fitzgerald ""Lynda Fitzgerald""","[8, 8]","Deepak Chopra's Seven Spiritual Laws of Success is not a book you read once and say, Hmmmm...good book. It's truly a way of life, of thinking and believing. His words are clear and logical, but his concepts come to be understood at a level beyond words--not as something we don't already know at some level, but as something we need to be reminded of frequently.He tells us that everything we wish is possible for us if we only live according to the laws of the universe, understanding that we are made up of energy, pure potentiality. He reminds us about the law of giving and receiving (which are one in the same thing), the law of intention and desire, the law of least effort (how to let the universe do the work), the law of detachment (how to let the universe show us the way to achieve our goals). He reminds us that we can find joy by asking the universe How may I serve rather than What's in it for me. His words are truly inspiring. Anyone following these laws cannot help but to become a better human being: more loving, kinder, happier.After reading the book, I purchased the audio version which I play each day on the way to and from work. It's a wonderful way to get my thoughts on track for the day ahead.Of all Deepak Chopra's works, and I've read most of them, this, to me, is the clearest and most practical. I can't recommend the book highly enough.",5,A Way of Life,1090972800,"07 28, 2004",2004,1368,"['Deepak', 'Chopra', 'Seven', 'Spiritual', 'Laws', 'Success', 'not', 'book', 'read', 'once', 'say', 'Hmmmm', 'good', 'book', 'truly', 'way', 'life', 'thinking', 'believing', 'words', 'are', 'clear', 'logical', 'concepts', 'come', 'be', 'understood', 'level', 'words', 'not', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'level', 'something', 'need', 'be', 'reminded', 'frequently.He', 'tells', 'everything', 'wish', 'possible', 'only', 'live', 'according', 'laws', 'universe', 'understanding', 'are', 'made', 'energy', 'pure', 'potentiality', 'law', 'giving', 'receiving', 'are', 'one', 'same', 'thing', 'law', 'intention', 'desire', 'law', 'least', 'effort', 'how', 'let', 'universe', 'do', 'work', 'law', 'detachment', 'how', 'let', 'universe', 'show', 'way', 'achieve', 'goals', 'can', 'find', 'joy', 'asking', 'universe', 'How', 'may', 'serve', 'rather', 'What', 'words', 'are', 'truly', 'inspiring', 'Anyone', 'following', 'laws', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'become', 'better', 'human', 'being', 'more', 'loving', 'kinder', 'happier.After', 'reading', 'book', 'purchased', 'audio', 'version', 'play', 'day', 'way', 'work', 'wonderful', 'way', 'get', 'thoughts', 'track', 'day', 'Deepak', 'Chopra', 'works', ""'ve"", 'read', 'most', 'clearest', 'most', 'practical', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'book', 'highly', 'enough']",Deepak Chopra: Seven Spiritual Laws/Crystal Cave

I liked that he challenged my belief systems and encouraged me to think outside of my programed way of thinking.  I immediately hopped online and decided to give one of his DVDs a try.  I'm glad I did.  While I'm not totally convinced of everything he teaches I am interested in delving deeper.  I found this particular DVD enlightening and entertaining.  I found myself taking loads of notes and even watching the Crystal Cave portion more than once on the same night.

553671,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00004W45B,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[14, 16]","Deepak Chopra has developed a unique approach to healing. He is famous for mingling modern theories with the timeless wisdom of ancient cultures.This DVD has two programs. In the first presentation, Deepak discusses the true meaning of success. He creatively defines success as a ""progressive realization of worthy goals."" Deepak explores the journey of success and not just the materialistic destination. He also explains the basic human needs.Deepak presents the ""Seven Spiritual Laws,"" which include the law of ""Pure Potentiality,"" ""Giving,"" ""Karma,"" Least Effort,"" ""Intention and Desire,"" ""Detachment,"" and ""The Law of Purpose/Dharma.""If you have experienced these laws in your own life, you will recognize the truth in each law and also question other aspects until you experience them yourself.When you listen to the section on ""Least Effort,"" you may start to question this law. Still, I think this law is true when you are looking at ""success"" from Deepak's perspective. If you are trying to attain ""material"" success, I think you still have to mix ""work"" with ""inspiration,"" to achieve your goals.Deepak does seem to want to cocoon the listener in a peaceful stillness or guiltless existence. If you listen to the surface ripples, you will hear things like ""you can obtain all pleasure without pain or guilt,"" ""success can come to you without effort."" Look deeper.While he discusses a quote by Jesus Christ, he doesn't discuss Jesus in the light of being the Savior and if there is no evil or sin, why would one need a Savior? To me, this is the secret to getting out of this world alive, because without Jesus Christ, it seems eternity is a tormented separation from the Creator. To not believe in evil would seem to me to only be a beautiful prison that is quickly shattered by one casual glance at reality.The second program is quite entertaining and is called: The Crystal Cave: Lessons from The Teachings of Merlin. This section includes: Summoning Our Inner Wizard, Seven Touchstones, Living Beyond Boundaries, The Silent Voice, Pure Awareness is Love, The Wizard's Reality, The Timeless Spirit and The Spark Within.Martin Sheen plays the part of Arthur, Robert Guillaume is Merlin and Johanna Cassidy is the narrator. The dramatic reading alternates with Deepak's engaging thoughts to leads you into the Crystal cave of your own awareness.Deepak Chopra presents his thoughts in an elegant, yet playful style. Deepak is definitely a Word Wizard and a master teacher who enchants you through his engaging style and keeps your mind active by challenging your belief system. His thoughts will inspire you to take many paths in your own thinking.Deepak has some rather intriguing puzzle pieces, but his thoughts about finding eternal life by dying daily seems to ignore the concepts of grace, forgiveness and a Savior. With that said, this DVD gave me a renewed confidence and hope of attaining my own goals.~The Rebecca Review",5,The Word Wizard Speaks,1075680000,"02 2, 2004",2004,2938,"['Deepak', 'Chopra', 'developed', 'unique', 'approach', 'healing', 'famous', 'mingling', 'modern', 'theories', 'timeless', 'wisdom', 'ancient', 'cultures.This', 'DVD', 'two', 'programs', 'first', 'presentation', 'Deepak', 'true', 'meaning', 'success', 'creatively', 'success', 'progressive', 'realization', 'worthy', 'goals', 'Deepak', 'journey', 'success', 'not', 'just', 'materialistic', 'destination', 'also', 'basic', 'human', 'needs.Deepak', 'Seven', 'Spiritual', 'Laws', 'include', 'law', 'Pure', 'Potentiality', 'Giving', 'Karma', 'Least', 'Effort', 'Intention', 'Desire', 'Detachment', 'Law', 'Purpose/Dharma', 'have', 'experienced', 'laws', 'own', 'life', 'will', 'recognize', 'truth', 'law', 'also', 'question', 'other', 'aspects', 'experience', 'yourself.When', 'listen', 'section', 'Least', 'Effort', 'may', 'start', 'question', 'law', 'Still', 'think', 'law', 'true', 'when', 'are', 'looking', 'success', 'Deepak', 'perspective', 'are', 'trying', 'attain', 'material', 'success', 'think', 'still', 'have', 'mix', 'work', 'inspiration', 'achieve', 'goals.Deepak', 'seem', 'want', 'cocoon', 'listener', 'peaceful', 'stillness', 'guiltless', 'existence', 'listen', 'surface', 'ripples', 'will', 'hear', 'things', 'can', 'obtain', 'pleasure', 'pain', 'guilt', 'success', 'can', 'come', 'effort', 'Look', 'quote', 'Jesus', 'Christ', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'Jesus', 'light', 'being', 'Savior', 'evil', 'sin', 'why', 'would', 'one', 'need', 'Savior', 'secret', 'getting', 'out', 'world', 'alive', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'eternity', 'tormented', 'separation', 'Creator', 'not', 'believe', 'evil', 'would', 'seem', 'only', 'be', 'beautiful', 'prison', 'quickly', 'shattered', 'one', 'casual', 'glance', 'reality.The', 'second', 'program', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'called', 'Crystal', 'Cave', 'Lessons', 'Teachings', 'Merlin', 'section', 'Summoning', 'Inner', 'Wizard', 'Seven', 'Touchstones', 'Living', 'Beyond', 'Boundaries', 'Silent', 'Voice', 'Pure', 'Awareness', 'Love', 'Wizard', 'Reality', 'Timeless', 'Spirit', 'Spark', 'Within.Martin', 'Sheen', 'part', 'Arthur', 'Robert', 'Guillaume', 'Merlin', 'Johanna', 'Cassidy', 'narrator', 'dramatic', 'reading', 'alternates', 'Deepak', 'engaging', 'thoughts', 'leads', 'Crystal', 'cave', 'own', 'awareness.Deepak', 'Chopra', 'thoughts', 'elegant', 'yet', 'playful', 'style', 'Deepak', 'definitely', 'Word', 'Wizard', 'master', 'teacher', 'who', 'engaging', 'style', 'keeps', 'mind', 'active', 'challenging', 'belief', 'system', 'thoughts', 'will', 'inspire', 'take', 'many', 'paths', 'own', 'thinking.Deepak', 'rather', 'intriguing', 'puzzle', 'pieces', 'thoughts', 'finding', 'eternal', 'life', 'dying', 'daily', 'ignore', 'concepts', 'grace', 'forgiveness', 'Savior', 'said', 'DVD', 'gave', 'renewed', 'confidence', 'hope', 'attaining', 'own', 'goals.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",Deepak Chopra: Seven Spiritual Laws/Crystal Cave
