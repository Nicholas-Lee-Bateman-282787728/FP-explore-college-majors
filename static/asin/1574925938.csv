Not every detail would be transferred from the book into the movie. And I knew that and yet I really enjoyed it. I've never expected it to be that good. It was no worse than the book and some scenes with the dead dogs felt realistic. The music is exceptional. I've searched for it but found no soundtrack or anything. Was pretty upset, just like about the fact that I can't get it on dvd.",5,WHY IS IT NOT ON DVD?,1311724800,"07 27, 2011",2011,428,"['story', 'book', 'expected', 'Not', 'detail', 'would', 'be', 'transferred', 'book', 'movie', 'knew', 'yet', 'really', 'enjoyed', ""'ve"", 'never', 'expected', 'be', 'good', 'was', 'worse', 'book', 'scenes', 'dead', 'dogs', 'felt', 'realistic', 'music', 'exceptional', ""'ve"", 'searched', 'found', 'soundtrack', 'anything', 'Was', 'pretty', 'upset', 'just', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'dvd']",N/A
191835,A10SH08T118BRY,1574925938,A. J. Rutten,"[11, 12]","I must admit that I am a Rutger Hauer fan, and have been ever since  &quot;Ladyhawke&quot; was made in 1985.  Additionally as an English  teacher, I am always looking for new videos to augment my literature units.  This excellent version of Jack London's tale of unconditional love,  survival of the fittest, and London's belief that all living creatures  including man are capable of returning to their wild beginnings has been  the perfect visual companion to my teaching the novel &quot;Call of the  Wild&quot; for the past 2 years - and it has Rutger Hauer to boot!!  Beautifully photographed in muted tones, &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; tells  the story of Buck, the exquisite Newfoundland, who is kidnapped because of  his massive size from his life of luxury in California and endures  tremendous hardships, many owners, and self-discovery as he is taken to the  gold rush in the Klondike.  Rutger Hauer portrays John Thornton,  the man  who saves Buck's life and introduces Buck to the unbridled joy of  unconditional love.  Richard Dreyfuss narrates beautifully, giving the  viewer an opportunity to actually experience bits and pieces of London's  exquisite prose. Although a number of previous film versions have been  made, this version is by far the best!  Not only is Buck actually the breed  of dog that was in London's story, but the screenplay follows the book the  most closely of all the versions!  Except for the brief insertion of a  saloon girl to romance Thornton for a moment and the minimizing of some of  Buck's many owners, the film visually portrays London's story as accurately  as I feel is possible.  I do recommend, however, that to fully experience  the depth of London's metaphor and themes, the book should be read!!  At  the very least, it is an excellent way in which to help children understand  that film comes from the written word and to help &quot;turn them on&quot;  to reading!!  Additionally, although the story depicts cruelty to animals  which is necessary to the plot's progress, the film exhibits a large  disclaimer at the beginning explaining that absolutely no animals were  harmed in the making of the movie!!  As an avid animal lover and advocate,  I could NOT have viewed nor could I recommend the film if it had not!  I  still cry during &quot;Old Yeller&quot;!  However even if the book is not  read, this is an outstanding family adventure film after which the topics  of greed, love, and sacrifice can be discussed!",5,Beautifully Rendered Film of London's Classic Tale!,959472000,"05 28, 2000",2000,2474,"['must', 'admit', 'am', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'fan', 'have', 'been', 'ever', 'quot', 'Ladyhawke', 'quot', 'was', 'made', '1985', 'Additionally', 'English', 'teacher', 'am', 'always', 'looking', 'new', 'videos', 'augment', 'literature', 'units', 'excellent', 'version', 'Jack', 'London', 'tale', 'unconditional', 'love', 'survival', 'fittest', 'London', 'belief', 'living', 'creatures', 'including', 'man', 'are', 'capable', 'returning', 'wild', 'beginnings', 'been', 'perfect', 'visual', 'companion', 'teaching', 'novel', 'quot', 'Call', 'Wild', 'quot', 'past', '2', 'years', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'boot', 'Beautifully', 'photographed', 'muted', 'tones', 'quot', 'Call', 'Wild', 'quot', 'story', 'Buck', 'exquisite', 'Newfoundland', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'massive', 'size', 'life', 'luxury', 'California', 'tremendous', 'hardships', 'many', 'owners', 'self-discovery', 'taken', 'gold', 'rush', 'Klondike', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'John', 'Thornton', 'man', 'who', 'Buck', 'life', 'introduces', 'Buck', 'unbridled', 'joy', 'unconditional', 'love', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'beautifully', 'giving', 'viewer', 'opportunity', 'actually', 'experience', 'bits', 'pieces', 'London', 'exquisite', 'prose', 'number', 'previous', 'film', 'versions', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'version', 'far', 'best', 'Not', 'only', 'Buck', 'actually', 'breed', 'dog', 'was', 'London', 'story', 'screenplay', 'book', 'most', 'closely', 'versions', 'brief', 'insertion', 'saloon', 'girl', 'romance', 'Thornton', 'moment', 'minimizing', 'Buck', 'many', 'owners', 'film', 'visually', 'London', 'story', 'as', 'accurately', 'feel', 'possible', 'do', 'recommend', 'however', 'fully', 'experience', 'depth', 'London', 'metaphor', 'themes', 'book', 'should', 'be', 'read', 'very', 'least', 'excellent', 'way', 'help', 'children', 'understand', 'film', 'written', 'word', 'help', 'quot', 'turn', 'quot', 'reading', 'Additionally', 'story', 'cruelty', 'animals', 'necessary', 'plot', 'progress', 'film', 'large', 'disclaimer', 'beginning', 'explaining', 'absolutely', 'animals', 'were', 'harmed', 'making', 'movie', 'avid', 'animal', 'lover', 'advocate', 'could', 'NOT', 'have', 'viewed', 'could', 'recommend', 'film', 'had', 'not', 'still', 'cry', 'quot', 'Old', 'Yeller', 'quot', 'However', 'even', 'book', 'not', 'read', 'outstanding', 'family', 'adventure', 'film', 'topics', 'greed', 'love', 'sacrifice', 'can', 'be', 'discussed']",N/A

For it has more strength than any wolf, more cunning than any dog. No one knows from whence he came or why he stays.""Gold was found in Alaska, the rush to obtain it required a strong constitution and many dogs to do the work that horses usually did in the states.  The environment bred harsh attitudes.  Also in the testing of ones mettle one finds their true potential.Buck (larger than most dogs) goes through many lives, trials, and tribulations finally realizing his potential.  On the way he learns many concepts from surprise, to deceit, and cunning; he also learns loyalty, devotion, and love.  As he is growing he feels the call of the wild.You do not have to have read the book to follow the story.  However being film much is accelerated and leaves less time for character and drama buildup.  A few characters are removed but the main characters do not have to be modified to fill in the gaps.For those that have read the book you will notice the narration is word for word extracted from the book.  You may also recognize the narrator's voice as that of Richard Dreyfuss.  The dialog was modified to cover much of the narration that was left out or the descriptions that were not portrayed.A few stories were left out or modified for brevity.  The main difference is a lot of the blood and guts were replaced with inferences and a story where he gets the stuffing beat out of him is replaced with a threat of being shot.  My only disappointment was leaving out the part where Buck, as wild as he becomes, periodically visits the place of John Thornton's demise.",5,Most excellent adaptation,1261699200,"12 25, 2009",2009,1683,"['Indians', 'frozen', 'land', 'tell', 'ghost', 'dog', 'head', 'wolf', 'pack', 'are', 'afraid', 'more', 'strength', 'wolf', 'more', 'cunning', 'dog', 'one', 'whence', 'came', 'why', 'Gold', 'was', 'found', 'Alaska', 'rush', 'obtain', 'required', 'strong', 'constitution', 'many', 'dogs', 'do', 'work', 'usually', 'did', 'states', 'environment', 'bred', 'harsh', 'attitudes', 'Also', 'testing', 'ones', 'mettle', 'one', 'true', 'potential.Buck', 'larger', 'most', 'dogs', 'many', 'lives', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'finally', 'realizing', 'potential', 'way', 'many', 'concepts', 'surprise', 'deceit', 'cunning', 'also', 'loyalty', 'devotion', 'love', 'growing', 'call', 'wild.You', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'follow', 'story', 'However', 'being', 'film', 'much', 'accelerated', 'less', 'time', 'character', 'drama', 'buildup', 'few', 'characters', 'are', 'removed', 'main', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'modified', 'fill', 'gaps.For', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'notice', 'narration', 'word', 'word', 'extracted', 'book', 'may', 'also', 'recognize', 'narrator', 'voice', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'dialog', 'was', 'modified', 'cover', 'much', 'narration', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'descriptions', 'were', 'not', 'portrayed.A', 'few', 'stories', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'modified', 'brevity', 'main', 'difference', 'lot', 'blood', 'guts', 'were', 'replaced', 'inferences', 'story', 'where', 'stuffing', 'beat', 'replaced', 'threat', 'being', 'shot', 'only', 'disappointment', 'was', 'leaving', 'out', 'part', 'where', 'Buck', 'as', 'wild', 'periodically', 'place', 'John', 'Thornton', 'demise']",N/A
