1264615,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B002E01LOI,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[5, 5]","(THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS)On one level, this movie follows a well-trodden path -- the quest of a young hotshot kid for fame and fortune in the big leagues. But it is a notch above that in its exploration of the exploitative world in which U.S. baseball franchises milk a small Caribbean nation for talent, hoping to find the next Sammy Sosa. For every major league slugger or golden arm unearthed, scores of lives lay shattered -- the lives of the wannabes who for one reason or another don't quite make it.Sugar is an aspiring pitcher with a 97 mph fastball and a bamboozling curve ball. In the Dominican Republic, we join him at a training camp where teenagers eat, drink and sleep baseball, all hoping and dreaming for a shot at the big time. Their regular education forgotten, they are drilled in the basic English vocabulary of the game -- ""home run, double play, I got it, etc etc.""Sugar gets his shot at training camp and is sent to a minor league team in the cornfields of Iowa where he boards with an elderly couple who provide a home for a different young player every year. Hardly knowing a word of English, he's fish out of water. But everything goes well at first as he wins his first few games. Then, all of a sudden, he loses his form, loses his cool and eventually walks out on the team and makes his way to New York, just another illegal immigrant trying to build his life. At that point, the movie also loses its focus.It's an interesting take on the seamier side of the baseball industry but the characters are not sharply enough drawn for the movie to be truly involving. Sugar seems like a pleasant young man but we hardly know what, if anything, is really going on inside his head. The movie is pleasant -- but one feels it hardly scratches the surface. It takes no risks and never tries to go deep.",3,Interesting rags to potential riches saga,1272499200,"04 29, 2010",2010,1826,"['THIS', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS', 'one', 'level', 'movie', 'well-trodden', 'path', 'quest', 'young', 'hotshot', 'kid', 'fame', 'fortune', 'big', 'leagues', 'notch', 'exploration', 'exploitative', 'world', 'U.S.', 'baseball', 'milk', 'small', 'Caribbean', 'nation', 'talent', 'hoping', 'find', 'next', 'Sammy', 'Sosa', 'major', 'league', 'slugger', 'golden', 'arm', 'unearthed', 'scores', 'lives', 'lay', 'shattered', 'lives', 'wannabes', 'who', 'one', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'it.Sugar', 'aspiring', 'pitcher', '97', 'mph', 'fastball', 'bamboozling', 'curve', 'ball', 'Dominican', 'Republic', 'join', 'training', 'camp', 'where', 'teenagers', 'eat', 'drink', 'sleep', 'baseball', 'hoping', 'dreaming', 'shot', 'big', 'time', 'regular', 'education', 'forgotten', 'are', 'drilled', 'basic', 'English', 'vocabulary', 'game', 'home', 'run', 'double', 'play', 'got', 'etc', 'etc', 'Sugar', 'shot', 'training', 'camp', 'sent', 'minor', 'league', 'team', 'cornfields', 'Iowa', 'where', 'elderly', 'couple', 'who', 'provide', 'home', 'different', 'young', 'player', 'year', 'Hardly', 'knowing', 'word', 'English', 'fish', 'water', 'everything', 'well', 'first', 'first', 'few', 'games', 'Then', 'sudden', 'form', 'cool', 'eventually', 'out', 'team', 'way', 'New', 'York', 'just', 'illegal', 'immigrant', 'trying', 'build', 'life', 'point', 'movie', 'also', 'focus.It', 'interesting', 'take', 'seamier', 'side', 'baseball', 'industry', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'sharply', 'enough', 'drawn', 'movie', 'be', 'truly', 'involving', 'Sugar', 'pleasant', 'young', 'man', 'hardly', 'know', 'what', 'anything', 'really', 'going', 'head', 'movie', 'pleasant', 'one', 'hardly', 'surface', 'risks', 'never', 'tries', 'go', 'deep']",Sugar

1264617,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B002E01LOI,Amit Talpade,"[1, 1]","SugarMiguel Santos AKA Azucar or sugar is a baseball hopeful who decides to try his hands at the dream of landing a gig with a major baseball team. The film begins with him at a training camp in the Dominican Republic along with several other players who dream the same dream i.e. to play in the major leagues. All of them hope to be invited for spring training with a league and eventually a contract. Miguel eats drinks and sleeps baseball so does his family. One day he gets that chance and arrives in a small town in Iowa for training. He lives with a family who host a new player every year, in the beginning he plays very well but things start to change. He has an injury and after that his game starts to erode, along that his confidence. One day he packs up his bag and heads to New York to find a life other than baseball.The film depicts the struggle of a person trying to make it to one of the most competitive professions in America. The film accurately follows the struggles of a stranger in a new land in the isolation, the language barrier, loss of friends and lack of familiar food and surroundings.The chase of the American dream is the theme and when hope meets reality one must adapt, which is what Miguel does. I liked the fact he does not give up on life and spirals downwards but adapts accordingly.Algenis Perez Soto is amazing and thoroughly transforms himself as a talkative, smiling young man in the Dominican Republic to a quiet, shy and hopeful kid trying to make a name for himself in America. His defeat although heartbreaking still offers hope that life can still be livable even if ones dreams are dead...I liked the movie. 4 stars 6/11/10",4,When hope meets reality,1276387200,"06 13, 2010",2010,1671,"['SugarMiguel', 'Santos', 'AKA', 'Azucar', 'sugar', 'baseball', 'hopeful', 'who', 'try', 'hands', 'dream', 'landing', 'gig', 'major', 'baseball', 'team', 'film', 'training', 'camp', 'Dominican', 'Republic', 'several', 'other', 'players', 'who', 'dream', 'same', 'dream', 'i.e', 'play', 'major', 'leagues', 'hope', 'be', 'invited', 'spring', 'training', 'league', 'eventually', 'contract', 'Miguel', 'drinks', 'sleeps', 'baseball', 'so', 'family', 'One', 'day', 'chance', 'small', 'town', 'Iowa', 'training', 'family', 'who', 'host', 'new', 'player', 'year', 'beginning', 'very', 'well', 'things', 'start', 'change', 'injury', 'game', 'erode', 'confidence', 'One', 'day', 'up', 'bag', 'heads', 'New', 'York', 'find', 'life', 'other', 'baseball.The', 'film', 'struggle', 'person', 'trying', 'make', 'one', 'most', 'competitive', 'professions', 'America', 'film', 'accurately', 'struggles', 'stranger', 'new', 'land', 'isolation', 'language', 'barrier', 'loss', 'friends', 'lack', 'familiar', 'food', 'surroundings.The', 'chase', 'American', 'dream', 'theme', 'when', 'hope', 'reality', 'one', 'must', 'adapt', 'what', 'Miguel', 'liked', 'fact', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'life', 'spirals', 'downwards', 'adapts', 'accordingly.Algenis', 'Perez', 'Soto', 'amazing', 'thoroughly', 'transforms', 'talkative', 'smiling', 'young', 'man', 'Dominican', 'Republic', 'quiet', 'shy', 'hopeful', 'kid', 'trying', 'make', 'name', 'America', 'defeat', 'heartbreaking', 'still', 'hope', 'life', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'livable', 'even', 'ones', 'dreams', 'are', 'dead', 'liked', 'movie', '4', 'stars', '6/11/10']",Sugar

One would think that with baseball being the 'national pastime' and all, and with spectators used to Dominican-bread superstars like Pedro, Manny and Big Papi - so familiar that you can identify them with one name or nickname - that audiences would find a movie that gives a credible backstory to the Dominican baseball experience an interesting viewing opportunity.  There are tens of millions of baseball fans who are missing out on a very good movie.That's too bad.  Co-writers/co-directors Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck proved withHalf Nelsonthat despite their young age, they can craft and direct compelling adult movies.  They have another winner here.  ""Sugar"" addresses two questions: how does the Dominican Republic pump out so many superior baseball players; and what happens to all the players that don't make it?  After all, the DR has baseball schools populated by hundreds of top prospects, but there's only a small percentage of those that actually attain the dream of the US major leagues.""Sugar"" is marked by two jarring transitions: the first when pitcher 'Sugar' (a winning portrayal by Algenis Perez Soto) is called from the DR to A ball in Iowa (called ""Bridgetown"" in the film, it's actually Davenport, IA); the second when our hero abruptly veers off-course.  I won't say anything more except to say that big-time Hollywood would have told a rags-to-riches story.

Then after a KC Royals training camp he is called up to play 1A ball in Iowa.Imagine this, you speak very little English...make that, well, no English, not enough to get along in the states anyway.  You leave your friends, family, girlfriend, and the only life you have ever known for a life of practice, high-level competition, player rivalry, sometimes unreachable levels of self-expectations, and a must-win mentality, plus this all happening to and around you in an unfamiliar culture that provides a confusing background for your new life.This film provides an extremely insightful view of life for talented, but very young foreign players and their eventual fates.

1264621,AVT9Q9PTUCDMR,B002E01LOI,Brian Maitland,"[3, 3]","Don't expect a typical sports movie (thank you!) as this is more a movie about the immigrant experience. I won't give away the story but let's just say it is a triumph of the human spirit but without the Hollywood ending where the guy gets the girl. The dream does but in a way that is more grounded in reality.In case you have no clue about what Sugar is about, it focuses on one Dominican Republic pitcher who is trying to make his way to the Big Leagues. The movie takes us along the way from the famous baseball academies of the Dominican through the instructional/rookie leagues to Single A ball in that most foreign of places--Iowa.You watch this movie and wonder how people who have so little (the Dominicans) can have such a vibrant, interesting and fun culture yet those who live in the breadbasket of America and want for nothing live such controlled lives that seem so lost. This undercurrent of the film is not emphasised but the scenes around the billet family's table are so telling. Despite hosting numerous Latin ballplayers the billet family's Spanish is still rudimentary and, although good people, have no concept of the loneliness of the ""immigrant"" ballplayer or of the reality of dumping these guys in the middle of nowhere with very few English skills.It's a damning indictment of Major League Baseball given the amount of money it generates. Would it kill each MLB team to help out their Latin ballplayers a tad more by even hiring a translator and an ESL teacher for them? How would that cost for a baseball season? OK, I'm off on tangent.Back to the movie, the acting is first-rate and mostly features Dominicans (including the lead who is outstanding at displaying deep emotion with just one look or action) with little or no acting experience coming in. The baseball scenes are spot on and ring so true. The whole thing shows again that HBO know what they are doing when it comes to putting out quality product.The extras are fantastic as we get the behind-the-scenes as per plus the classic first interview with lead actor Algenis Perez Soto as well as coverage of the premiere in the Dominican which features sme nice testimonials of the film by MLBers Pedro Martinez, Sammy Sosa, Francisco Cordero and Robinson Cano.So real historians of the Latin influence on MLB there is the Roberto Clemente reference but big kudos for throwing in the Vic Power (Google him to paraphrase the Puerto Rican shopkeeper in the film) reference.An absolute must-see film for baseball fans both hardcore and casual.",5,as sweet a movie and much better than this attempted pun is,1314144000,"08 24, 2011",2011,2526,"['Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'typical', 'sports', 'movie', 'more', 'movie', 'immigrant', 'experience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'story', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'triumph', 'human', 'spirit', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'where', 'guy', 'girl', 'dream', 'way', 'more', 'grounded', 'reality.In', 'case', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'Sugar', 'about', 'one', 'Dominican', 'Republic', 'pitcher', 'who', 'trying', 'make', 'way', 'Big', 'Leagues', 'movie', 'way', 'famous', 'baseball', 'academies', 'Dominican', 'instructional/rookie', 'Single', 'A', 'ball', 'most', 'foreign', 'places', 'Iowa.You', 'watch', 'movie', 'wonder', 'how', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'so', 'little', 'Dominicans', 'can', 'have', 'such', 'vibrant', 'interesting', 'fun', 'culture', 'yet', 'who', 'live', 'breadbasket', 'America', 'want', 'nothing', 'live', 'such', 'controlled', 'lives', 'seem', 'so', 'lost', 'undercurrent', 'film', 'not', 'emphasised', 'scenes', 'billet', 'family', 'table', 'are', 'so', 'telling', 'hosting', 'numerous', 'Latin', 'ballplayers', 'billet', 'family', 'Spanish', 'still', 'rudimentary', 'good', 'people', 'have', 'concept', 'loneliness', 'immigrant', 'ballplayer', 'reality', 'dumping', 'guys', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'very', 'few', 'English', 'skills.It', 'damning', 'indictment', 'Major', 'League', 'Baseball', 'given', 'amount', 'money', 'Would', 'kill', 'MLB', 'team', 'help', 'out', 'Latin', 'ballplayers', 'tad', 'more', 'even', 'hiring', 'translator', 'ESL', 'teacher', 'How', 'would', 'cost', 'baseball', 'season', 'OK', ""'m"", 'off', 'tangent.Back', 'movie', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'mostly', 'features', 'Dominicans', 'including', 'lead', 'who', 'outstanding', 'displaying', 'deep', 'emotion', 'just', 'one', 'look', 'action', 'little', 'acting', 'experience', 'coming', 'baseball', 'scenes', 'are', 'spot', 'ring', 'so', 'true', 'whole', 'thing', 'shows', 'again', 'HBO', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'when', 'putting', 'out', 'quality', 'product.The', 'extras', 'are', 'fantastic', 'get', 'behind-the-scenes', 'classic', 'first', 'interview', 'lead', 'actor', 'Algenis', 'Perez', 'Soto', 'as', 'well', 'coverage', 'premiere', 'Dominican', 'sme', 'nice', 'testimonials', 'film', 'MLBers', 'Pedro', 'Martinez', 'Sammy', 'Sosa', 'Francisco', 'Cordero', 'Robinson', 'Cano.So', 'real', 'historians', 'Latin', 'influence', 'MLB', 'Roberto', 'Clemente', 'reference', 'big', 'kudos', 'throwing', 'Vic', 'Power', 'Google', 'paraphrase', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'shopkeeper', 'film', 'reference.An', 'absolute', 'must-see', 'film', 'baseball', 'fans', 'hardcore', 'casual']",Sugar

This so-called 'wider market' neglects grown-ups and teens who are allowed to see R-rated movies but don't own a Blu-Ray player, which in actuality, is the WIDEST demographic!Blu-Ray is not the standard yet. One day it will be, but it is not yet what the majority of people own. This was an atrocious marketing decision, as was the studio's decision to castrate one of the BEST-REVIEWED movies of the year.There have been sanitized versions of films released on DVD in the past, but always alongside a separate unrated or theatrical version. However, this is the FIRST time, in my memory, that a sanitized version has been released on a format ONLY. Think about it like this-- this is the equivalent of Huckleberry Finn being only available abridged in print form, and only available unabridged on Amazon Kindle. It's insane, it's anti-art, it's anti-artist.The word needs to be spread. Standing idly by will only mean more films receiving this same unfair treatment in the future.

1264626,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B002E01LOI,Jason,"[2, 2]","Sugar is no doubt a wonderfully told, slowly but interestingly paced, realistic tale of the difficulties Major League Baseball (MLB) has with aspiring young talent.  These problems are magnified in Caribbean countries where baseball is shown as the only opportunity, and boys as young as 13 engage in the possibility of saving their family from poverty via a baseball signing bonus and eventual pro career.  Sinewy and receptive to advice, Miguel ""Sugar"" Santos is a Dominican star whose fire-balling right arm may just provide the gold at the end of the rainbow.Portrayed methodically like a documentary, the daily life of struggling Dominican ball players is exposed for what it is: a life changing possibility hinged on genetic lottery.  With the legacy of MLB stars from San Pedro de Macoris alone (covered fairly well by Mark Kurlansky with his book ""The Eastern Stars""), it's easy to see how this becomes the primary choice and opportunity.  Athletes eat, sleep, and breathe baseball, American culture, the English language - only phrases pertinent to baseball - while being mindful of the back-breaking plantation work awaiting the unsuccessful.  Thanks to a newly acquired, knee-buckling ""spike"" curveball (i.e. knuckle-curve), Sugar is one of the lucky few who gets his shot in the Minor Leagues.  Upon traveling to Iowa, however, he soon realizes all fields are not made of dreams.While sympathy can certainly be felt for someone in Sugar's situation, the illegal immigration aspect is severely glossed over in this film.  That, in and of itself, lessens the impact for me.  If the shady side of baseball recruiting is to be exposed, rightfully so, then those who are exploited by the MLB farm system should also look in the mirror from time to time.  Glass houses.Anyway, the reserved performance by Algenis Perez Soto creates a heart-warming atmosphere easy for viewers to support.  The athletic performances are completely legitimate, and there are no ridiculous ""Nuke"" Laloosh pitching motions.  For sports fanatics this is essential.  While I didn't necessarily like the ending, the overall pacing and filming of Sugar made it difficult to cheer for the opposing team.",4,"Not completely out of left field, but definitely a different baseball movie",1303344000,"04 21, 2011",2011,2183,"['Sugar', 'doubt', 'wonderfully', 'told', 'slowly', 'interestingly', 'paced', 'realistic', 'tale', 'difficulties', 'Major', 'League', 'Baseball', 'MLB', 'aspiring', 'young', 'talent', 'problems', 'are', 'magnified', 'Caribbean', 'countries', 'where', 'baseball', 'shown', 'only', 'opportunity', 'as', 'young', '13', 'engage', 'possibility', 'saving', 'family', 'poverty', 'baseball', 'signing', 'bonus', 'eventual', 'pro', 'career', 'Sinewy', 'receptive', 'advice', 'Miguel', 'Sugar', 'Santos', 'Dominican', 'star', 'fire-balling', 'right', 'arm', 'may', 'just', 'provide', 'gold', 'end', 'rainbow.Portrayed', 'methodically', 'documentary', 'daily', 'life', 'struggling', 'Dominican', 'ball', 'players', 'exposed', 'what', 'life', 'changing', 'possibility', 'hinged', 'genetic', 'lottery', 'legacy', 'MLB', 'stars', 'San', 'Pedro', 'Macoris', 'alone', 'covered', 'fairly', 'well', 'Mark', 'Kurlansky', 'book', 'Eastern', 'Stars', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'primary', 'choice', 'opportunity', 'eat', 'sleep', 'breathe', 'baseball', 'American', 'culture', 'English', 'language', 'only', 'pertinent', 'baseball', 'being', 'mindful', 'back-breaking', 'plantation', 'work', 'awaiting', 'unsuccessful', 'Thanks', 'newly', 'acquired', 'knee-buckling', 'spike', 'curveball', 'i.e', 'knuckle-curve', 'Sugar', 'one', 'lucky', 'few', 'who', 'shot', 'Minor', 'Leagues', 'traveling', 'Iowa', 'however', 'soon', 'fields', 'are', 'not', 'made', 'dreams.While', 'sympathy', 'can', 'certainly', 'be', 'felt', 'someone', 'Sugar', 'situation', 'illegal', 'immigration', 'aspect', 'severely', 'glossed', 'over', 'film', 'impact', 'shady', 'side', 'baseball', 'recruiting', 'be', 'exposed', 'rightfully', 'so', 'then', 'who', 'are', 'exploited', 'MLB', 'farm', 'system', 'should', 'also', 'look', 'mirror', 'time', 'time', 'Glass', 'houses.Anyway', 'reserved', 'performance', 'Algenis', 'Perez', 'Soto', 'heart-warming', 'atmosphere', 'easy', 'viewers', 'support', 'athletic', 'performances', 'are', 'completely', 'legitimate', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'Nuke', 'Laloosh', 'pitching', 'motions', 'sports', 'fanatics', 'essential', 'did', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'ending', 'overall', 'pacing', 'filming', 'Sugar', 'made', 'difficult', 'cheer', 'opposing', 'team']",Sugar

When he gets picked for the minor leagues in America, he knows it's just a matter of time before he is a household name and superstar.  It turns out big dreams and talent are a dime a dozen in baseball, and while the pressure to succeed is enormous, there's always someone waiting in the wings to replace those who falter.Sugar is a simple film, well told, about the American dream and the outsourcing of the so-called American sport, baseball.  It starts out seeming like a classic sports success story of the underdog making his mark, along the lines ofRockyorThe Karate Kidbut with an international twist.  It turns out to be something much more interesting and unexpected, a meditation on America from the perspective of the outsider coming in, and a new look at the immigrant experience, that manages to be both realistic and hopeful and uniquely unpredictable.  This is very intelligent filmmaking, a powerful sophomore feature by the talented directing and screenwriting team of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, who traveled to the Dominican Republic and spoke with several whose stories resemble the one they depicted here in order to create a very authentic, true-to-life story, that is very different than their also compelling debut featureHalf Nelson.

1264630,A19QFPITR2N8M9,B002E01LOI,Nelson E. Donley,"[1, 4]","This movie was a big let-down from the very beginning, when a sign flashed on the screen stating that the movie had been modified from it's original content. I was tempted to change videos, but my wife insisted upon giving it a chance. By the time the movie was about half-way through, she had fallen asleep. I was tempted to do the same, but decided to endure to the very end so that I might be able to write a short review.Why so many people have given this movie a positive review is probably because of the society we live in. People are obnoxious & cannot get through the day without a cellphone. I don't even know why it's called ""Sugar."" Perhaps, these are the same sort of people who get excited by watching fresh paint dry. I tried to find positive things to say about ""Sugar"" but there are so few things to rave about. I will start with the positive side, first.The acting in this movie is very good; realistic and convincing. I just wondered where the producers found so many Dominicans and Puerto Ricans could act so well. The setting is also very realistic, probably because it was filmed on location. And the plot, or storyline, was natural and easy to follow. It's just a boring movie.""The Sopranos"" on HBO was very graphic due to copious sex and violence, but the series wasn't propelled to such heights on that alone. Each of the characters were multidimensional and intriguing. You followed them along, week after week, until they got whacked. After the series ended it was modified for television. The F-word was replaced by thousands of ""friggins"" and the girls at the Bada Bing danced in bikinis instead of topless. In short, the TV version of ""The Sopranos"" was like eating a pizza without the cheese. That is what I feel may have happened to ""Sugar"" by modifying it down from an ""R"" to a mediocre ""PG"" rating.""Sugar"" is a movie on the same level as ""About Schmidt"" as far as excitement and intrigue are concerned except for only one thing; ""Sugar"" didn't have any actors even close to the level of a Jack Nicholson; an actor so compelling that his mere presence more often than not will make even the lousiest movie worth watching. The plot in ""Sugar"" was insignificant and boring. In ""About Schmidt,"" Nicholson could take a mundane line and say it in such a way that defined his entire character. There was no such instance in ""Sugar.""When Sugar arrived in the U.S., he stayed with an old couple in Kansas. They gave him the run of the house with only two rules; no alcohol and no women. That would have been a perfect opportunity for the movie to become compelling, but nothing happened. He got thrown out of a game for throwing the ball at the batter, but nothing ever became of it. He was also given drugs which helped him to pitch a couple of great innings, but nothing came of that. Finally, he loses complete confidence in himself and decides to become an illegal alien by moving to New York. Nothing ever became of that.This morning, when my wife woke up, she asked me how the movie ended. ""The movie ends with Sugar playing sandlot baseball in New York City with a bunch of other illegal aliens."" She was happy that she didn't lose any sleep over such a lousy movie. This is a movie that you would have to pay me before I'd watch it again. Even then, I'd watch it while working a crossword puzzle in my lap.Some people may think that I'm not giving this movie a fair chance when, in fact, I gave this movie more than a fair chance. It's just one of those mediocre films that gets shelled out all the time. The best thing I can say about it is that in making this film, a lot of people got a job.My recommendation: Watch this movie if you're really bored & have nothing better to do with your time other than to watch paint dry. But RENT IT! Don't waste your money on it unless your money is burning a hole in your pockets.",2,Never Mind the Sugar...

1264633,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002E01LOI,Turfseer,"[1, 1]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Sugar is the nickname for an aspiring Dominican ballplayer, Miguel Santos, played by newcomer Algeniz Perez Soto. We first meet Miguel in his hometown in the Dominican Republic, where he is sort of a legend due to his prowess as a star pitcher for the local baseball club. Everyone in the town looks up to these ballplayers with the expectation that they're all going to make it in professional baseball in the United States and bring home the bacon. Sugar is no exception and believes he's got what it takes to become a star professional baseball player. One is immediately impressed with the camaraderie amongst the aspiring ballplayers--they all seem to enjoy gently ribbing one another as to their ball playing abilities and obsession in making it to the big leagues.Miguel is good enough to be invited to spring training with the Kansas City Knights (a fictional name for the real life Kansas City Royals). The film's scenarists do an excellent job of depicting the culture shock when Sugar first arrives in the United States. First and foremost is the language barrier and Sugar must depend on his friend, Jorge, who he knows from back in DR, to translate for the Spanish speaking players (the players follow Jorge's lead when he orders French toast at a restaurant; later, a kindly waitress teaches Miguel the difference between 'scrambled' eggs and 'sunny side up'). Miguel does well enough to be promoted to Single A minor league team in a small town in Iowa.Miguel is placed with the Higgins family who have a history of taking in Dominican players in their home during their stint with this particular minor league baseball team. The Higgins are religious and Sugar ends up attending the Higgins' daughter's church youth group as well as actual church services. The father is the only family member who knows any Spanish at all but his skills are limited. I found it annoying that the rest of the family members (particularly the daughter) kept speaking English to Miguel knowing full well that he didn't know what she was saying. There was no attempt on the daughter's part (nor Miguel's) to break out a Spanish-English dictionary and at least try to communicate with the aid of at least a dictionary. Eventually, Miguel does pick up enough English to get by but it's made clear that until he learns enough of the language, he remains alienated during his sojourn in Iowa. Due to the culture clash, Miguel almost gets into big trouble when a group of locals at a bar start to pick a fight after Miguel is seen dancing with one of the local hotties.Miguel's friend, Jorge, is eventually cut from the team after his skills diminish due to the aggravation an old leg injury. Then Miguel sustains a knee injury and is sidelined for a few weeks. When he returns, his pitching skills also have diminished and he resorts to taking pills (steroids?) to enhance his performance. While successful for a couple of innings, by the midpoint of the game, Miguel beans an opposing batter and a fight ensues between both teams. While the fight is going on, Miguel appears to be in a complete daze, obviously unable to handle the drugs he's just put into his system. The manager then relegates Miguel to the bullpen, which only serves to intensify his depression.Some internet posters find it unbelievable that Miguel would so easily give up his baseball career after deciding to leave the team and take off to New York City. Not every aspiring ballplayer will have the same reaction. In Miguel's case, he not only realized that he wasn't good enough to make it in the big leagues, he was also put off by the way the team wasn't willing to be patient with his friend Jorge who, according to Miguel, ""had worked so hard"". Miguel also correctly assessed the situation that he would be cut from the team and didn't want to endure the humiliation of being told he was no longer wanted by them.The film's denouement highlights Miguel's travails in NYC where he struggles to find a job and tries to figure out what he wants to do with the rest of his life. Eventually, he takes a job as a busboy and becomes friends with the owner of a carpenter shop, who takes him in when he runs out of money which he was using to pay for a room at a flea bag hotel. Miguel's friend allows him to work at the shop for free where he builds a table which he plans to send to his mother back in DR. The final scene shows Miguel playing sandlot baseball with other Dominican ballplayers who gave up their dream of playing professional baseball. No longer feeling pressure to succeed in a 'career', Miguel now seems more content in his new life and can enjoy playing baseball simply for the fun of it.It's refreshing to see a film about an ordinary Hispanic guy who's not a criminal. There's been a tendency to focus more on the criminal behavior in the movies today involving Hispanic culture. Although 'Sugar' lacks a discernible antagonist, the focus is really on Miguel's internal arc, as he comes to grips with the fact that he really isn't cut out to be a ballplayer. The introverted Miguel isn't really much of a complex character and hence 'Sugar' will not be remembered for big dramatic scenes.
