This is one of my favorite movies she played in as well as ""I Want To Live"" for which she received an academy award  in 1958.  Would loved to have seen  her get the role of Scarlett O''Hara, although Vivien Leigh did a great job as Scarlett.  Definitely a chick flick!  So if you like chick flicks you will like this one.  So happy to finally find a DVD of Backstreet.  Have no interest in the earlier version as Susan Hayward and John Gavin were perfect for these characters.",5,Susan Hayward and John Gavin great together in this movie.,1338595200,"06 2, 2012",2012,515,"['Susan', 'Hayward', 'favorite', 'actress', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'played', 'as', 'well', 'Want', 'Live', 'received', 'academy', 'award', '1958', 'Would', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'get', 'role', 'Scarlett', 'O', 'Hara', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Scarlett', 'Definitely', 'chick', 'flick', 'So', 'like', 'chick', 'flicks', 'will', 'like', 'one', 'So', 'happy', 'finally', 'find', 'DVD', 'Backstreet', 'Have', 'interest', 'earlier', 'version', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'John', 'Gavin', 'were', 'perfect', 'characters']",Back Street (1941)/Back Street (1961) Double Feature
1495434,A8S11VP9Z36D6,B005N7Z7Y4,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[14, 16]","""Back Street"" (1961) starring Susan Hayward was pretty much the last VHS I owned that I couldn't get rid of yet because it hadn't made it to DVD yet. With Blu-ray out now, I figured it was a lost cause to think that Universal would ever release it on disc. I was pleasantly surprised to find that not only is it now available from TCM (Turner Classic Movies), but it was packaged as a set with the earlier version (1941) starring Charles Boyer and Margaret Sullavan. First I had to watch my favorite--the glossy Technicolor version that pulled out all the stops to make it one of the biggest melodramas of all time. The transfer looks virtually pristine; rich Technicolor, no flaws that I can see, and solid audio that shows off the heart-tugging score by Frank Skinner (who also did the score for the 1941 version). I was even more pleasantly surprised to find out that both versions have a nice selection of extras; you can scan through the vintage publicity stills and lobby cards for each movie. Definitely more than I bargained for. The 1941 version does not look as good; shot in black and white, it has plenty of scratches, but definitely watchable. After having been able to watch both, I can say that I still am biased towards the 1961 version, which took a number of liberties with the storyline, originally based on a Fannie Hurst novel.In both, Ray/Rae Smith is a single gal who happens to fall in love with a man just about to be married. In both movies, the man chooses Ray/Rae over his fianc&eacute;, and in both movies, fate keeps them apart at the crucial moment and the men move on thinking that Ray/Rae has moved on. Years later, the two meet up again and resume the affair. In the 1941 version, I felt very little for the leads (played by Charles Boyer and Margaret Sullavan). Boyer seems a little on the slimy side, and Sullavan comes off as stupid and whiny. Flash forward to the 1961 version, and the lead male (John Gavin) comes off as a solid husband and father who ended up marrying the town drunk and whore. The audience can't help but be sympathetic for Rae (Hayward) when she takes him back in her arms despite his already being married. In the 1941 version, we never see the wife or are told any reason why Boyer would be cheating on her. By the end of the film, I was ready to be rid of both characters; by the finish of the 1961 version, there isn't a dry eye in the house. Sure, the script is a bit overdone at times, but with the gorgeously auburn-haired Hayward, you can forgive some of the trite dialogue when it's being tossed around by her.Overall, this set is a must have for those who love Ross Hunter's weepy 50s/60s melodramas; consider the 1941 version an added bonus!",5,Back Street finally makes it to DVD!,1320537600,"11 6, 2011",2011,2711,"['Back', 'Street', '1961', 'starring', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'last', 'VHS', 'owned', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'rid', 'yet', 'had', ""n't"", 'made', 'DVD', 'yet', 'Blu-ray', 'out', 'now', 'figured', 'was', 'lost', 'cause', 'think', 'Universal', 'would', 'ever', 'release', 'disc', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'not', 'only', 'now', 'available', 'TCM', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'was', 'packaged', 'set', 'earlier', 'version', '1941', 'starring', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'Margaret', 'Sullavan', 'First', 'had', 'watch', 'favorite', 'glossy', 'Technicolor', 'version', 'pulled', 'out', 'stops', 'make', 'one', 'biggest', 'melodramas', 'time', 'transfer', 'virtually', 'pristine', 'rich', 'Technicolor', 'flaws', 'can', 'see', 'solid', 'audio', 'heart-tugging', 'score', 'Frank', 'Skinner', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'score', '1941', 'version', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'versions', 'have', 'nice', 'selection', 'extras', 'can', 'scan', 'vintage', 'publicity', 'stills', 'lobby', 'cards', 'movie', 'Definitely', 'more', 'bargained', '1941', 'version', 'not', 'look', 'good', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'plenty', 'scratches', 'definitely', 'watchable', 'having', 'been', 'able', 'watch', 'can', 'say', 'still', 'am', 'biased', '1961', 'version', 'took', 'number', 'liberties', 'storyline', 'originally', 'based', 'Fannie', 'Hurst', 'novel.In', 'Ray/Rae', 'Smith', 'single', 'gal', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'man', 'just', 'be', 'married', 'movies', 'man', 'Ray/Rae', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'movies', 'fate', 'keeps', 'apart', 'crucial', 'moment', 'men', 'move', 'thinking', 'Ray/Rae', 'moved', 'Years', 'later', 'two', 'meet', 'up', 'again', 'resume', 'affair', '1941', 'version', 'felt', 'very', 'little', 'leads', 'played', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'Margaret', 'Sullavan', 'Boyer', 'little', 'slimy', 'side', 'Sullavan', 'off', 'stupid', 'whiny', 'Flash', 'forward', '1961', 'version', 'lead', 'male', 'John', 'Gavin', 'off', 'solid', 'husband', 'father', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'marrying', 'town', 'drunk', 'whore', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'Rae', 'Hayward', 'when', 'back', 'arms', 'already', 'being', 'married', '1941', 'version', 'never', 'see', 'wife', 'are', 'told', 'reason', 'why', 'Boyer', 'would', 'be', 'cheating', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'ready', 'be', 'rid', 'characters', 'finish', '1961', 'version', ""n't"", 'dry', 'eye', 'house', 'Sure', 'script', 'bit', 'overdone', 'times', 'gorgeously', 'auburn-haired', 'Hayward', 'can', 'forgive', 'trite', 'dialogue', 'when', 'being', 'tossed', 'her.Overall', 'set', 'must', 'have', 'who', 'love', 'Ross', 'Hunter', 'weepy', '50s/60s', 'melodramas', 'consider', '1941', 'version', 'added', 'bonus']",Back Street (1941)/Back Street (1961) Double Feature

1495436,A106016KSI0YQ,B005N7Z7Y4,Jay Dickson,"[4, 4]","Fannie Hurst's melodramatic 1931 novel about the life of a wealthy man's mistress over the course of several decades has been three times made into a film, the first (and least famous) in the year after it was published, with Irene Dunne. Gathered in this set are the two other and more famous versions: the campy 1961 version with Susan Hayward; and the renowned 1941 version with Margaret Sullavan and Charles Boyer. The 1961 adaptation is yet another in the long line of swanky soapers turned out in that decade to star aging movie stars like Hayward and Lana Turner; Hayward was much past her prime when this came out, and had ceased to turn in the kind of fine work she had done in the 1940s. Here she's too hard (although she looks terrific in her Jean-Louis gowns) and the dated material can't really carry her, or the wooden John Gavin, along. In contrast, though in the 1941 version the Hurst source material was already dated, Margaret Sullavan redeems everything with her performance, and strikes great sparks with her co-star Charles Boyer (whom she had begged Universal to work with). Boyer isn't much in his scenes without Sullavan, but becomes transformed whenever she's onscreen. The confusingly elaborate plot, which involves the early days of horseless carriages (in Cincinnati, for some reason) doesn't really help things much, and Sullavan's turn-of-the-century outfits, with her giant picture hats and lace-trimmed highbutton collars, aren't flattering to her. But this is one of her best roles, and allows her to project her peculiar dreamy complexity that redeemed just about every movie she was ever in. Probably Barbara Stanwyck was about the only other actress from the Golden Age of Hollywood who could convey a conflicted inner life the way Sullavan could, and even Stanwyck did not quite have that strange sense of specialness Sullavan could always convey on the screen, especially with her rich, husky voice. The set is worth buying just to see Sullavan in such a good role (though there's also the pleasures of Susan Hayward being hardbitten in Jean-Louis for the having too).",4,The double life,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,2107,"['Fannie', 'Hurst', 'melodramatic', '1931', 'novel', 'life', 'wealthy', 'man', 'mistress', 'course', 'several', 'decades', 'been', 'three', 'times', 'made', 'film', 'first', 'least', 'famous', 'year', 'was', 'published', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'Gathered', 'set', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'more', 'famous', 'versions', 'campy', '1961', 'version', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'renowned', '1941', 'version', 'Margaret', 'Sullavan', 'Charles', 'Boyer', '1961', 'adaptation', 'yet', 'long', 'line', 'swanky', 'soapers', 'turned', 'out', 'decade', 'star', 'aging', 'movie', 'stars', 'Hayward', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'Hayward', 'was', 'much', 'prime', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'had', 'ceased', 'turn', 'kind', 'fine', 'work', 'had', 'done', '1940s', 'Here', 'too', 'hard', 'terrific', 'Jean-Louis', 'gowns', 'dated', 'material', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'carry', 'wooden', 'John', 'Gavin', 'contrast', '1941', 'version', 'Hurst', 'source', 'material', 'was', 'already', 'dated', 'Margaret', 'Sullavan', 'everything', 'performance', 'strikes', 'great', 'sparks', 'co-star', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'whom', 'had', 'begged', 'Universal', 'work', 'Boyer', ""n't"", 'much', 'scenes', 'Sullavan', 'transformed', 'onscreen', 'confusingly', 'elaborate', 'plot', 'early', 'days', 'horseless', 'carriages', 'Cincinnati', 'reason', ""n't"", 'really', 'help', 'things', 'much', 'Sullavan', 'turn-of-the-century', 'outfits', 'giant', 'picture', 'hats', 'lace-trimmed', 'highbutton', 'collars', 'are', ""n't"", 'flattering', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'project', 'peculiar', 'dreamy', 'complexity', 'redeemed', 'just', 'movie', 'was', 'ever', 'Probably', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'was', 'only', 'other', 'actress', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Hollywood', 'who', 'could', 'convey', 'conflicted', 'inner', 'life', 'way', 'Sullavan', 'could', 'even', 'Stanwyck', 'did', 'not', 'quite', 'have', 'strange', 'sense', 'specialness', 'Sullavan', 'could', 'always', 'convey', 'screen', 'especially', 'rich', 'husky', 'voice', 'set', 'worth', 'buying', 'just', 'see', 'Sullavan', 'such', 'good', 'role', 'also', 'pleasures', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'being', 'hardbitten', 'Jean-Louis', 'having', 'too']",Back Street (1941)/Back Street (1961) Double Feature

It's the story of a Back Street romance. In other words an affair with a married man. In this instance the wife(Vera Miles) is not to be sympathized with. She's a drunken selfish harpy. rae Smith (Susan Hayward), the other woman on the other hand is warm, loving and understanding . I've seen this movie numerous times and although I  no longer start crying as early as I used to, the last scene still gets me.As for the 1941 version included here  I give it three stars.
