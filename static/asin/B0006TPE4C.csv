By accident he meets a husband and wife team of Existential Detectives (played brilliantly by Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin), who immediately and aggressively start helping him unravel his life. Hilarity and unexpected plot twists ensue. A mysterious and seductive competing Existential Detective (presumably from the Dark Side of Existential Detecting) threatens to throw a wrench in Albert's search for himself. And somehow Shania Twain gets mixed up in the mess.This movie is filled with wonderful quotes like ""Do you want to be noticed? Perhaps urgently?"" and ""We're not in infinity; we're in the suburbs.""You will likely either love or hate this movie.

Definitely worth even 20 dollars for it..It was a great comedy movie, and finally a smart film, not some stupid, plain comedy!As the film rolls along, we see all the drama play out and how characters will lie to try and fool the Existential Detectives, but the joke's on them. Seeing how Jude Law becomes unraveled once his jovial facade is punctured by the detectives, as well as how Schwartzman's existential angst is traced back to an event in childhood is just amazing to watch. This film is so right on with the psychology books I've read and my own ponderings into my inner life. People should see this film over and over and use the information presented to examine their own inner nature. It will lead to some profound conclusions. Its a shame this film wasn't discovered by more people in theaters. I think it would make an excellent TV series as Existential Detectives take on new clients each week, as viewers learn about how important events from our past affect our perception of the world and how we view others and ourselves. My favorite line in the film is when Naomi Watts tells Jude Law something like ""you just can't deal with my infinite nature!"" Brilliant. The music is also a perfect match for the film. If you're buying this DVD, you'll want the soundtrack as well. Its perfect to listen to, especially on a bad day when you need some cheering up.

An environmental activist hires existential detectives to solve a coincidence, while also wanting to know the meaning of his existence. This leads to a domino affect of people in his life, hiring these detectives to solve their own life dilemmas. I Heart Huckabees has a sense of humor about some serious topics and I can see why this film rubs people from all walks of life the wrong way. Why? Because it makes fun of people from all walks of life, rubbing one another...the wrong way. Also, the main characters are a bit flakey with obsessive agendas. Some of the agendas are global, some are personal, and some are both. Long list of brilliant actors you would never imagine being in a film together. Yet, they work so well together with a snappy dialog, talking over one another, and stealing the scene from one another. It works with the precision of superb editing. The soundtrack of melodies remains fresh and I find myself humming to them. FYI: Dustin Hoffman is not wearing a wig.

874194,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,B0006TPE4C,Brian A. Schar,"[2, 3]","I Heart Huckabees is definitely not like anything you've seen before.  I have to give it at least a couple of stars for attempting something different and unique, given that so many movies are just cookie-cutter copies of one another.  It's refreshing to see a movie that is not predictable and in which you don't see the ending coming 90 minutes beforehand.This movie is kind of an allegory of different philosophies.  Schwartzman starts off disillusioned with environmentalism, and successively confronts and rejects materialism (Brad), existentialism (the detectives), religion (the African guy's adoptive family), nihilism (the French woman) and narcissism (the Huckabees girl), rejecting each of them in turn.  It is only when Schwartzman thinks for himself and synthesizes something from his own intelligence and experience that he is able to reach a personal resolution.  I'm not sure that's what the message of this movie is supposed to be, but it's what I'm taking with me, and I'm sticking to it.  Having said all that, you get a college-freshman-bull-session level view of all these philosophies, rather than a serious examination thereof; but, this is a 2 hour comedy, not a survey class, so that's OK.While this is billed as a comedy, this is not a laugh-a-minute film, although there are some very funny parts.  The performances are uniformly good.  In particular, Dustin Hoffman actually acts for a change, instead of playing himself like he has for the last 10 years.  Mark Wahlberg also turns in a standout performance.The one thing that isn't unique is the tired old ""evil capitalist"" cliche, which first came to prominence in ""Jaws,"" and hasn't really gone away since.  Still, it's a comedy, so you can just roll with it.Not everyone will care for this movie, which has nothing to do with the viewer's intelligence, but rather on their taste and their tolerance for quirkiness.  It's probably best as a rental the first time around, rather than a blind purchase.

You see, he's looking for the meaning of it all, and he's had some strange coincidences lately that he thinks have some greater meaning, but then again, maybe they don't mean anything. But that's for the detectives to find out.As the Jaffes investigate, they learn of a falling out between Albert and Brad Stand (Jude Law), an executive at Huckabees, ""The Everything Store,"" who has his own plans for Open Spaces, which involve using Shania Twain as a poster girl. Soon, Brad has hired Bernard and Vivian to work on his own case, but Albert believes that he's just trying to push him out of his own coalition. Brad thinks that Albert has an infatuation with his girlfriend, Dawn (Naomi Watts), who is the poster girl for Huckabees.Meanwhile, Albert is introduced to his ""other"" (a sort of existential buddy system), Tommy (Mark Wahlberg), who is also being investigated by the Jaffes, but rejects their ideas that everything has a meaning and we are all a part of the same fabric. Instead, Tommy has been following the teachings of Caterine (Isabelle Huppert), who argues that nothing has any meaning and this is all just pointless. Albert gets swept up in this battle of everything versus nothing and hilarity ensues.It sounds confusing, but it's all a ruse, you see. The whole point that writer-director David O. Russell is trying to make is that beneath all of the talk about why are we here and what is the meaning of life, there is really no basis, or maybe there's a greater meaning. Whatever the answer is, we'll never really know, so talking about it is ridiculous to begin with. It's quite brilliant actually, because a whole lot is said, but then again, nothing is said. It seems that everybody's talking, but who is saying anything?Huckabees is full of hilarious banter and slapstick moments, and all of the performances are dead-on. All of the actors play the parts straight, which makes it even funnier. In the middle of a conversation about the infinite, Tommy chimes in, ""We're not in infinity, we're in the suburbs,"" and he means it. It's not funny to him, but it sure is to me. When Bernard says, ""There's no such thing as nothing,"" he really means it, but it doesn't actually mean anything. And that pretty much sums up this film.",5,"A film about everything, or nothing, either way it's great",1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,2991,"['Heart', 'Huckabees', 'film', 'everything', 'nothing', 'once', 'Actually', 'lie', 'not', 'Well', 'sort', 'be', 'existentialism', 'really', 'what', 'about', 'satirizing', 'philosophy', 'exposing', 'how', 'ludicrous', 'whole', 'thing', 'are', 'who', 'will', 'watch', 'film', 'think', 'Wow', 'really', 'think', 'are', 'missing', 'point', 'point', 'see', 'words', 'talk', 'find', 'everything', 'Heart', 'Huckabees', 'nothing.Albert', 'Markovski', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'young', 'director', 'environmental', 'organization', 'called', 'Open', 'Spaces', 'pair', 'existential', 'detectives', 'Bernard', 'Vivian', 'Jaffe', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'spy', 'see', 'looking', 'meaning', 'had', 'strange', 'coincidences', 'lately', 'have', 'greater', 'meaning', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'anything', 'detectives', 'find', 'out.As', 'Jaffes', 'investigate', 'learn', 'falling', 'out', 'Albert', 'Brad', 'Stand', 'Jude', 'Law', 'executive', 'Huckabees', 'Everything', 'Store', 'who', 'own', 'plans', 'Open', 'Spaces', 'involve', 'using', 'Shania', 'Twain', 'poster', 'girl', 'Soon', 'Brad', 'hired', 'Bernard', 'Vivian', 'work', 'own', 'case', 'Albert', 'just', 'trying', 'push', 'own', 'coalition', 'Brad', 'Albert', 'infatuation', 'girlfriend', 'Dawn', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'who', 'poster', 'girl', 'Huckabees.Meanwhile', 'Albert', 'introduced', 'other', 'sort', 'existential', 'buddy', 'system', 'Tommy', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'who', 'also', 'being', 'investigated', 'Jaffes', 'ideas', 'everything', 'meaning', 'are', 'part', 'same', 'fabric', 'Instead', 'Tommy', 'been', 'following', 'teachings', 'Caterine', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'who', 'nothing', 'meaning', 'just', 'pointless', 'Albert', 'swept', 'up', 'battle', 'everything', 'versus', 'nothing', 'hilarity', 'ensues.It', 'confusing', 'ruse', 'see', 'whole', 'point', 'writer-director', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'trying', 'make', 'talk', 'why', 'are', 'here', 'what', 'meaning', 'life', 'really', 'basis', 'maybe', 'greater', 'meaning', 'answer', ""'ll"", 'never', 'really', 'know', 'talking', 'ridiculous', 'begin', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'actually', 'whole', 'lot', 'said', 'then', 'again', 'nothing', 'said', 'everybody', 'talking', 'who', 'saying', 'anything', 'Huckabees', 'full', 'hilarious', 'banter', 'slapstick', 'moments', 'performances', 'are', 'dead-on', 'actors', 'play', 'parts', 'straight', 'even', 'funnier', 'middle', 'conversation', 'infinite', 'Tommy', ""'re"", 'not', 'infinity', ""'re"", 'suburbs', 'not', 'funny', 'sure', 'When', 'Bernard', 'such', 'thing', 'nothing', 'really', ""n't"", 'actually', 'mean', 'anything', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'film']",N/A

Russell took some time off to regroup and recover after a grueling shoot. He returned with a vengeance last year with one of the most challenging movies to be backed by a major studio in recent years. Calling it an absurdist comedy doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of this complex movie.I Heart Huckabees is in the same absurdist tradition of Robert Altman's Brewster McCloud or the little seen Elliot Gould film, Little Murders. Like these movies, Huckabees follows its own internal logic and assumes that the audience will stick with the film even if they don't understand what exactly is happening or why. This is definitely a movie that requires repeated viewings if only to absorb all of the ideas that it examines and the questions that is poses.Huckabees gleefully thumbs its nose at conventional narrative filmmaking by being a philosophical comedy that throws out a lot of fascinating ideas and asks a lot of interesting questions. As the characters struggle with weighty issues so the film struggles with weighty themes. Whether either is successful is left up the viewer to decide. If you come away from Huckabees thinking about a couple of them then this film has done its job.There is an audio commentary by writer/director David O. Russell. He elaborates on what we are watching which helps if you are mystified by this movie.The second commentary features Russell again, this time joined by Schwartzman and Wahlberg with Naomi Watts edited in separately. Schwartzman recounts amusing anecdotes about making the movie and keeps things light.

Quite a bit according to this joy of a film.  David O. Russell and Jeff Baena have written a highly intelligent comedy about a man who's trying to make sense of his life.  That man is Albert Markovski (Jason Schwartzman), a founder of a group called the Open Space Coalition who are trying to preserve forest and marsh area's where big business want to tear it down.  In his latest attempt he's joined forces with a chain-store known as Huckabees whose exec on the way up Brad Stand (Jude Law) seems to have a hidden agenda.  All this aside, Albert is troubled by a very tall African teenager that has crossed his path on three occasions and he is convinced this coincidence has substantial meaning in his life, so he seeks out the help of Vivian & Bernard Jaffe (Tomlin and Hoffman), two existential detectives, hiring them to follow his every move to decipher how his life makes sense.Vivian and Bernard are also helping Tommy (Mark Whalberg), a firefighter with strong views on humanity's role in destroying the environment.  When Brad finds out about Albert's association with these detectives he sees this as a way to get at Albert, to diminish his credibility with Open Spaces and thus gain control of the land and marsh Huckabees wishes to tear down.  So he himself enlists the help of Vivian and Bernard in order to jab at Albert's sanity, and this affects his girlfriend Dawn (Naomi Watts in another brilliant performance) who begins to take these detectives advise seriously and this jeopardizes her relationship with Brad and with Huckabees since she is `the voice' and `the look' of the store.When Tommy and Albert meet they decide to ditch Vivian and Bernard's methods in pursuit of Caterine Vauben (Isabelle Huppert), a French existential detective who is in competition with the Jaffes.  Their methods, while similar, are actually at two separate extremes and throughout the film Albert finds the balance he needs to make sense of it all.  This film is pure joy, hilarious from start to finish thanks in part to the brilliant acting on the entire cast, Tomlin and Law are standouts to me for their comedic timing is impeccable, and Whalberg is a complete surprise, holding his own and proving he can act.

It is a movie where you have to pay attention to get and understand everything, including the comic and existential overtones, but I like quirky films like this.  It kind of reminded me of some of the movies from the 60's that address existentialism.  Something you don't see talked about too much in society today.As the commentary notes, people don't really want to think about their existence today except in the form of ""what is the solution.""  Our society has really embraced so many things that quiet any higher thought in this area, but I feel optimistic that things come full circle and old and new thoughts will be addressed once again.

Enter Bernard (Dustin Hoffman) and Vivian (Lily Tomlin), a team of existential detectives, who also happen to be married to each other.  They are determined to take on Albert's case, pro bono, and find out the root cause(s) of his anxiety and what blocks him from becoming truly free of what shackles him to his turbulent past.  Through taking on this pro bono case, Bernard and Vivian also have encounters with Albert's colleagues at Huckabees, who are struggling with identity crises of their own--co-workers Brad (Jude Law) and Dawn (Naomi Watts).I really don't know how to best describe this film.  If you are looking to compare this to a distinctive style, I would say the closest it comes to is the brilliant THE SEARCH FOR SIGNS OF INTELLIGENT LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE, written by Jane Wagner, and performed by Lily Tomlin (who steals this film, along with Dustin Hoffman).

874215,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0006TPE4C,Ed Uyeshima,"[8, 15]","There is an odd idiosyncratic appeal to this movie, but it's really not enough to warrant a recommendation from me. The concept is certainly original as the story follows Albert Markovski, an angry, questioning environmental activist as he tries to piece together a strange series of coincidental run-ins with a tall African man with the help of a couple of oddball ""existential"" detectives. That's only the beginning, as the detectives get involved with the huge department store chain, Huckabees, which has agreed to sponsor Albert's green-friendly program to prevent construction of a store on a marshland. This type of movie requires Woody Allen's perspective on nihilism combined with Alexander Payne's humanistic sensibilities. Unfortunately director/writer David O. Russell lets his ambition get the best of him, and he has made a movie that wants to be intellectual and funny but ends up being neither.It's a shame because he has assembled a star-studded cast of capable actors, but in a certain way, their presence only compounds the problem since their contributions look so disjointed in what amounts to a convoluted story of self-discovery. The more central problem is that Albert, as played with enervating surliness by Jason Schwartzman, is not really a sympathetic protagonist, so the eccentric characters surrounding him do not really have anything that distinct with whom to bounce their extreme behavior. As the mind-bending duo Vivian and Bernard, Lily Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman (with an unflattering Emo Philips haircut) are as comically delightful as the script allows them to be, as they snoop to find the greater meaning of Albert's situation and spout their banal universe-is-a-blanket philosophy without irony. Their nemesis is Caterine Vauban, played with awkward remoteness by revered French actress Isabelle Huppert, who really doesn't seem like she knows what she's saying.Caught between the adversarial philosophies is not only Albert but also Tommy Corn, an oil-hating, post-9/11-traumatized firefighter who sides with Vauban's belief that everything is meaningless; Brad Stand, the corporate climber who caves into his own shallowness; and Dawn Campbell, the Huckabees model spokesperson inevitably coupled with Brad but finding her own inner self as an Amish handmaiden complete with bonnet, overalls and dirty teeth. Mark Wahlberg plays Tommy in his familiar roughhewn manner; Jude Law struggles with a non-descript American accent as he convincingly plays the conniving golden boy Brad gone to seed; and Naomi Watts makes Dawn as air-headed and unfulfilled as her character proves to be.  These characters have a meltdown in one form or another, and that's about the only connective theme in the plot. Otherwise there is really no conclusion to derive from the shenanigans Russell has set up here and consequently no emotional pay-off. There are some interesting cameo appearances in the film - the still-great looking Tippi Hedren as the head of the effort to save the marsh; Talia Shire (Schwartzman's real mother) as Albert's cold-fish mother; Jean Smart as a religious zealot mother who has ""adopted"" the African that Albert has been tracing; and even country superstar Shania Twain, the subject of Brad's ongoing schmooze story about the perils of eating chicken salad.There is a lot of smart dialogue here, but it sputters by so fast and without apparent purpose that I couldn't appreciate most of it. But what the movie lacks the most is the heart in its title as Russell seems carried away by his cleverness and his thwarted attempts to concoct a cerebral screwball farce. Nice try but it doesn't work. The single edition DVD has audio commentary by Russell, as well as some contributions form Schwartzman, Wahlberg and Watts. While it helps to hear Russell's point in creating scenes and reinforcing the messages he is trying to convey here on existentialism, it's also a chore to make such connections as you're watching the movie. It certainly didn't interest me in getting the second disc of the special edition package.",2,Star-Studded Cast in Russell's Existential Screwball Misfire,1116720000,"05 22, 2005",2005,4067,"['odd', 'idiosyncratic', 'appeal', 'movie', 'really', 'not', 'enough', 'warrant', 'recommendation', 'concept', 'certainly', 'original', 'story', 'Albert', 'Markovski', 'angry', 'questioning', 'environmental', 'activist', 'piece', 'together', 'strange', 'series', 'coincidental', 'run-ins', 'tall', 'African', 'man', 'help', 'couple', 'oddball', 'existential', 'detectives', 'only', 'beginning', 'detectives', 'get', 'involved', 'huge', 'department', 'store', 'chain', 'Huckabees', 'agreed', 'sponsor', 'Albert', 'green-friendly', 'program', 'prevent', 'construction', 'store', 'marshland', 'type', 'movie', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'perspective', 'nihilism', 'combined', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'humanistic', 'sensibilities', 'Unfortunately', 'director/writer', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'ambition', 'get', 'best', 'made', 'movie', 'be', 'intellectual', 'funny', 'up', 'being', 'neither.It', 'shame', 'assembled', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'capable', 'actors', 'certain', 'way', 'presence', 'only', 'problem', 'contributions', 'look', 'so', 'disjointed', 'what', 'amounts', 'convoluted', 'story', 'self-discovery', 'more', 'central', 'problem', 'Albert', 'played', 'enervating', 'surliness', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'not', 'really', 'sympathetic', 'protagonist', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'surrounding', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'have', 'anything', 'whom', 'bounce', 'extreme', 'behavior', 'mind-bending', 'duo', 'Vivian', 'Bernard', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'unflattering', 'Emo', 'Philips', 'haircut', 'are', 'comically', 'delightful', 'script', 'be', 'snoop', 'find', 'greater', 'meaning', 'Albert', 'situation', 'spout', 'banal', 'universe-is-a-blanket', 'philosophy', 'irony', 'nemesis', 'Caterine', 'Vauban', 'played', 'awkward', 'remoteness', 'revered', 'French', 'actress', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'who', 'really', ""n't"", 'seem', 'what', 'saying.Caught', 'adversarial', 'philosophies', 'not', 'only', 'Albert', 'also', 'Tommy', 'Corn', 'oil-hating', 'post-9/11-traumatized', 'firefighter', 'who', 'sides', 'Vauban', 'belief', 'everything', 'meaningless', 'Brad', 'Stand', 'corporate', 'climber', 'who', 'own', 'shallowness', 'Dawn', 'Campbell', 'Huckabees', 'model', 'spokesperson', 'inevitably', 'coupled', 'Brad', 'finding', 'own', 'inner', 'self', 'Amish', 'handmaiden', 'complete', 'bonnet', 'overalls', 'dirty', 'teeth', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Tommy', 'familiar', 'roughhewn', 'manner', 'Jude', 'Law', 'non-descript', 'American', 'accent', 'convincingly', 'conniving', 'golden', 'boy', 'Brad', 'gone', 'seed', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Dawn', 'air-headed', 'unfulfilled', 'character', 'be', 'characters', 'have', 'meltdown', 'one', 'form', 'only', 'connective', 'theme', 'plot', 'really', 'conclusion', 'derive', 'shenanigans', 'Russell', 'set', 'up', 'here', 'consequently', 'emotional', 'pay-off', 'are', 'interesting', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'film', 'still-great', 'looking', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'head', 'effort', 'save', 'marsh', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'Schwartzman', 'real', 'mother', 'Albert', 'cold-fish', 'mother', 'Jean', 'Smart', 'religious', 'zealot', 'mother', 'who', 'adopted', 'African', 'Albert', 'been', 'tracing', 'even', 'country', 'superstar', 'Shania', 'Twain', 'subject', 'Brad', 'ongoing', 'schmooze', 'story', 'perils', 'eating', 'chicken', 'salad.There', 'lot', 'smart', 'dialogue', 'here', 'fast', 'apparent', 'purpose', 'could', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'most', 'what', 'movie', 'most', 'heart', 'title', 'Russell', 'carried', 'away', 'cleverness', 'thwarted', 'attempts', 'concoct', 'cerebral', 'screwball', 'farce', 'Nice', 'try', ""n't"", 'work', 'single', 'edition', 'DVD', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Russell', 'as', 'well', 'contributions', 'form', 'Schwartzman', 'Wahlberg', 'Watts', 'hear', 'Russell', 'point', 'creating', 'scenes', 'reinforcing', 'messages', 'trying', 'convey', 'here', 'existentialism', 'also', 'chore', 'make', 'such', 'connections', ""'re"", 'watching', 'movie', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'interest', 'getting', 'second', 'disc', 'special', 'edition', 'package']",N/A

Firstly, I think it the height of stupidity, even if the studio intended it, that the film is called ""I HEART Huckabees"". The correct phrasing as I should well know is ""I LOVE Huckabees"".Having got that off my chest, I have a huge problem with the toadying up to existentialism and Sartre that goes so hand-in-hand with this film. Existentialism and especially Sartre are NOT FUN...this film is fun. To hell with existentialism and Sartre.I found it refreshing and brilliant that an ""Existentialist Investigation Agency"" could actually work in a film as a concept--it makes me wonder why we don't really have such agencies. I'd love to be told I'll be spied upon, then have someone actually do it and tell me where I go wrong.This is the point of this delightful, best-seen-hit-and-run-style film. It isn't existentialism, it's CONSCIENCE. Tomlin and Hoffman are the protagonists' respective consciences! It is brilliant, and if one is not open to self exploration/criticism, one won't ""get"" the film.So forget about comparisons with ""The Royal Tennenbaums"" and ""Iggy Blah Blah"" and the others. This film is much more akin to one of Terry Gilliam's masterpieces, because it reflects humanity's quirks the same way.Usual kudos to the great work on this film...and personally, I think Mark Wahlberg is at his sexiest in this film. He makes up for the irritating dorkiness of the alleged ""main character"" played by Jason Schwartzman, who is a sort of tougher version of comedian Richard Lewis.

874221,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B0006TPE4C,General Zombie,"[8, 29]","I might as well open by saying that I'm extremely picky when it comes to comedies.  I simply don't watch them much: The last comedy I saw in the theater was 'The Life Aquatic...'.  That was over a year ago.  The last comedy I saw prior to that in theater was, I'm pretty sure, 'As Good As It Gets' way back in 1997.  That's a seven year layoff, coming from someone who does actually go to the movies regularly, though not constantly.  So I'm tough to please in this field, I guess.  Nevertheless, when it does come to contemporary comedy, it is films like this that I typically like.  I really like Charlie Kaufman and Wes Anderson, two obvious points of comparison to this film, and the apparent similarity between the various artists is the reason I decided to check this out.  And they are quite similar, with 'I Heart Huckabees' coming of as a lame, heartless Anderson clone. (I'm not necessarily suggesting that this is a knockoff; Russell has been around for a long time, I know, maybe he's been making films like this for years.  Nevertheless, that's what it *feels* like.)  The trouble is this is your quirky oddball character comedy, yet the characters consist of maybe one not particularly amusing quirk, and they are very, very obnoxious, and they don't feel human at all.  In order for this sorta film to work you need to like the characters, which I certainly do not.  Then it just meanders around in circles, each silly, tedious character coming on to do their little bit again and again and again.  It grows remarkably tedious, so much so that I actually gave up and shut the DVD off, the only time I've ever consciously stopped watching something that I paid for.  I eventually caved and finished it off a couple of hours later, but only because I felt I compulsive need to finish what I'd started, and I'd need to have finished it if I ever wanted to review it.  So here I am.The film has a generally very strong cast, a bit of visual flair and opens with some promise.  It falls apart quickly, with my reaction being pretty much identical to that of Peter Schorn's over at IGN DVD:  ""The first 15 minutes indicated some quirky oddball fun was in store, but the 5 minutes that followed that felt like an hour and the actual hour after that felt like mental cruelty.""  The film doesn't really have much of a plot per se, it's mostly just situational, involving the conflict between an environmental activist (Jason Schwartzman) and a weasely PR guy at a Wal-Mart (Jude Law) esque corporation called Huckabees.  The Schwartzman character is curious about his place in the world and a couple of bizarre coincidences, so at the beginning of the film he hires a couple of existential detectives (Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin) and they just kinda start screwing around with his life and bringing other people into the conflict, such as disillusioned, anti-petroleum obsessed fireman (Marky Mark) and dimwitted Huckabees spokesmodel and Law's girlfriend. (Naomi Watts) And so on.  Yes a number of things happen, but none of it matters or leads anywhere at all until the very end and I certainly didn't care about any of it anymore at that point.Again, it starts out alright, with some amusing patter between the ultra-dorky Schwartzman and the detectives, and some of their methods are kind of amusing.  (They follow him around, everywhere, and use sensory deprivation therapy on him which leads to an initially amusing collage-esque scene.  Like much everything else in this movie, this conceit is interesting the first time, tiresome the next 5 times.)  But the film has got nowhere to go, and most of the other characters they introduce are very tiresome. (Now this isn't to say that the final 80% of the film is utterly irredeemable.  It has a few moments, but it never comes to life at all, and there are plenty of parts where it absolutely falls flat on its face.  Note the mud puddle sex scene, in particular. Pretty much all the stuff involving the French nihilist, actually.)I really like Schwartzman in general, but here he is largely charmless.  There just isn't anything to his character.  He just wonders about the nature of reality, and complains about deforestation and that's it.  Marky Mark's fireman is utterly unbearable.  He's just so stupid and whiny and he inarticulately goes on and on about petroleum concern in pretty much every scene he's in.  He's tiresome the first time you see him, and this grows to pure hatred by the end. (One assumes Russell identifies particularly with these two characters, so I applaud his willingness to make light of them, but he can't pull it off at all. Perhaps it really is just easier to mock others than to mock yourself.)  Law's character is just extraordinarily bland, and doesn't earn a single laugh.  He's kinda the villain of the film, but we rarely get to see him acting actively villainous.  He's always got a front on.  He's just slick and boring.  Hoffman and Tomlin lose their luster almost immediately as they have, like Marky Mark, only one bit which is repeated again and again.  (Hoffman goes on and no about how everything is connected.  Fairly amusing the first time, but it's exactly the same every time it's repeated)  Then there's the Watts character, who is based on the idea that stupid people are funny.  Well, Dawn is stupid, I'll give her that, and she's less obnoxious than some of the other characters, though this may largely be simply because she's got relatively little screen time.Some people try and say that this film attempting to be deep or complex, but I don't buy it.  Not just that it says something about the human condition, but that it was even really intended to.  I think Russell is just having fun with this pseudo-philosophical stuff.  (At least one of us is....)Eventually things do come together a bit at the end.  Not to say that it gets better or more interesting, but something actually happens other than the characters simply standing around and repeating dialogue and ideas for the fourth time.  Some characters change or get their comeuppance or whatever, but I don't give a damn cause none of these characters is worth a damn.Yeah, this film is mostly a formless wreck.  On the plus side, it does have a few scenes where Naomi Watts doesn't have very many clothes on, but that's about all it has going for it, and there are not enough of them to help much.  Not nearly enough to save the film.Grade: D",2,"Tedious, repetitive, obnoxious",1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,6427,"['might', 'as', 'well', 'open', 'saying', ""'m"", 'extremely', 'picky', 'when',

I was curious to discover if the movie lived up to the expectations. Are these investigators really going to explore man's interpretation of our existence? The fact that these investigators are played by Lily Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman, two actors that I enjoy watching, didn't inhibit my interest either. If you are well read on the subjects played out in the movie, you might feel as though the variables are exhibited as two opposing extremes, with no room for any grey area's in-between or any possibilities that reside outside of the boxes. And you might feel teased that once these two established options are portrayed that the plot seems to be repeating itself without further exploration, without delving into why we assume these dichotomies, what the historical references are, or any new suggestions for these quandaries. Except of course for the end, which apparently is supposed to be some sort of epiphany, but ends up being a rather predictable and disappointing resolution. Bear in mind that I do come from a scientific perspective, meaning I don't necessarily examine our questioning as a form of destiny or fate that needs to be discovered, but rather as how our own minds have a hard wired drive to find one. I am fascinated with understanding functional neurology and exactly how the brain's physiology fires off these philosophical neurons. I do admire the production of this movie, and for the mainstream audience it might be thoughtful enough, and you will think about it for a day or two, or three which is more than I can say for a lot of movies. I do think that they might of held back when this movie was in development, perhaps there should be two versions, this one that brings up the ideas, and a second that assumes we can handle more.

Ever.Combining a number of existential principles (lightly) at polar opposites we are given the by the proponents of each in the wife and husband team of Lily Tomlin and Dustin Hoffmann (who believe everything in the universe to be connected) and sexy French nihilist, Isabelle Huppert (who espouses nothing is connected and life is only ugly pain/drama followed by the bliss of complete nothingness.)  The resolution at film's end is something of an inevitable revelation that had been threatening to occur throughout the film and director David Russell holds off releasing this delicious orgasmic bit for as long as possible.Tomlin and Hoffman's  ""clients"" come to them in different ways.  Jason Schwartzman a young environmentalist idealist out to save the world, Mark Wahlberg, a disillusioned fireman with his own environmental (and myriad other) issues, Jude Law and girlfriend Naomi Watts, vain, take-no-prisoners types who would stop at nothing in their climbing of the social ladder.  The journey of the soul each of them takes is unique, remarkable, hilarious and touching.While the multiple special effects throughout the film seem judiciously used only to further the storylines, there is no denying the hypnotic eye-candy effect they achieve, and damn are they fun!The performance of every member of this magnificent acting ensemble is something to cherish. Lily Tomlin looks terrific and has never been fresher - she's an underrated American treasure and here gives a comic performance balanced, nuanced and assured, whether dodging sprinklers, diving through car windows, on bicycle chases or otherwise racing around (and always in high heels!).  Hoffmann is her perfect movie match and he and Tomlin's respect and affection for each other (sharing kisses at seemingly inappropriate times) feels genuine and as a team they are simply remarkable.Mark Wahlberg has developed into a very special actor and the levels of anger, hurt, frustration, confusion and revelation his character undergoes never once have a false ring.  His performance is nearly perfect and encapsulated with grace and delicate comic timing.  Who'd have thought he'd become THIS?Isabelle Huppert's cold, clinical and oh-so-very-French foil to Hoffmann/Tomlin is almost too much.  Her presence felt early on when she finally bursts in ""for real"" in the story she nearly walks away with it.Jason Schwartzman's Albert is the heart and soul of the movie and with whom we're seemingly most supposedly to identify with.  This isn't at all difficult given his committed, fully thought out performance.  Though Wahlberg's Tommy Corn is Albert's ""Other"" (as in self, half, spiritual etc.) Albert must connect with every other character and he does so, splendidly.The calming d&eacute;nouement is achieved following a near orgy of out-of-control emotions, self-discovery, acceptance and growth that is nearly overwhelming.  I'm not ashamed to say that as hard as I laughed throughout Huckabees, there were tears in my eyes at the end.  It is a beautiful, madcap, enlightening journey of self-discovery and Russell clearly wants everyone to enjoy the ride.The Bonus Disc is (literally) hours of fun, particularly the extended/deleted scenes and the Naomi Watts faux commercial spots for Huckabees ""Your EVERYTHING Store""There is not a missed beat or false note throughout I &#9829;Huckabees and David O. Russell more than fulfills the expectations he made with his trio of excellent 90's movies.

874225,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0006TPE4C,Grady Harp,"[2, 6]","I HEART HUCKABEES is odd, weird, unfocused, overly obtuse, and flagrantly over directed and produced.  So why bother seeing it?  Well, given all the above negatives, it all depends on what you expect from spending and hour and a half of your time with an experimental film.  First clue: the cast.  There must be a reason that such class actors as Isabelle Huppert, Jude Law, Naomi Watts, Dustin Hoffman, and yes, Lily Tomlin would want to be a part of this m&eacute;lange of comedy and philosophy and environmental concerns vs. corporate greed.  Add to the mix the solid work of Mark Wahlberg and Jason Schwartzman and the elusive talent of writer/director David O. Russell (whose biggest credit is 'Spanking the Monkey') and you wind up with a fairly tasty goulash billed as an Existential Comedy.The fun of the movie is in the attitude of the viewer: if you can swallow the wild antics and bloated concepts and just concentrate on the use/abuse of the theories of Existentialism and Nihilism, you'll have a good time.  This film gives us permission to retrospectively laugh or giggle at memories of college classroom awe with which we absorbed 'the new philosophies'.  Time and the expansion (? or is it contraction?) of the universe have put all things into a different perspective, and for this viewer telling a story about contemporary tropes referencing hallowed philosophical theories works.Most of the fun comes not from the proposed comedic roles of Hoffman, Tomlin and Huppert (though they are amazingly understated in their acting here), but from the craftsmanship of Law, Watts, and Wahlberg plus a dollop of fresh work from Jason Schwartzman.  Goofy it is, over baked it is, silly and absurd it is, but it is the stuff we walk among everyday! A kinky comedy to be taken with a grain of patience.

It is interesting to see how Mark Wahlberg has grown as an actor.  Hard to believe this is the same guy who used to model Calvin Klein underwear.  I'm not so impressed with Jason Schwartzman in his best role since Rushmore.  Lily Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman were great as the existential detectives, but Jude Law is Jude Law.  He doesn't change from film to film.  I've grown quickly tired of his Brilliantine screen presence.While the film shrouded itself in the ""big idea,"" it never really delivered.

874228,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B0006TPE4C,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[3, 6]","By me, quirky is good. So is comedy. ""I Heart Huckabees"" is a quirky comedy, which deals with existentialism, nihilism and the search for Truth. Well, the cast is outstanding, anyway, if existentialism and nihilism don't grab your attention, and you don't need any more Truth in your life. I loved this film...and I hated it. Talk about philosophical ambivalence! The movie's premise is hilarious, absurd, very intelligent, and too esoteric. It does not succeed in bringing forth much laughter...from me anyway, although there are some outstanding comedic vignettes. How could there not be with Lilly Tomlin in the cast? The satire is good, and one doesn't necessarily have to respond to irony with belly laughs in order to appreciate it. I just found myself looking at my watch half-way through ""Huckabees"" - not a good sign. I didn't exactly want to turn off my DVD player, but at times I felt like it. Sorry if I am not being very helpful here. Let me be more specific, unlike the film.Young Albert Markovsky, (Jason Schwartzman), is an environmental activist, a local leader and the founder of the Open Spaces Coalition, an organization dedicated to fighting ""urban sprawl."" He is also a serious poet (?), who fervently believes he can reach the public through his art. In one scene, the environmentalists have succeeded in saving one single rock in an extensive wetlands, which are about to be destroyed. One of the lines in Albert's celebratory poem reads, ""You rock, rock."" His personal nemesis is Huckabees, a chain of stores which sells all things to everyone, and in order to expand perpetually, destroys the natural world - wildlife, trees, and swamps. Their agenda is to build more malls and parking lots for easier access to their customers. Brad Stand, (Jude Law), is an up-and-coming sales exec, who personifies Huckabees. Albert hates him. Brad adores himself, is infatuated with his own charisma and is followed almost everywhere by his groveling staff - who hope to move upward and onward with this 'young Turk.' He takes an ""if you can't beat them, join them"" approach to the environmentalists. Representing Corporate America, he embraces the activists' cause, arranges for Huckabees, (through him), to co-sponsor a benefit starring Shania Twain, and other celebs, and quickly has the environmentalists enamored of him and his ideas, while they step all over Albert's sincere efforts and sneer at his poems. Of course Brad plans to pay little more than lip service to Open Spaces' and the environmental issues they represent. He is not gonna deliver. But there will be a benefit with the media lauding Huckabees as a major supporter of Mother Earth.Albert is depressed, and on top of his low spirits, he is obsessed by a coincidence. He runs into the same stranger, a Sudanese refugee, three times in a few days - in totally different settings. He believes there is a cosmic meaning behind the random encounters. By chance, he finds a business card which advertises a firm specializing in Existential Detective Crisis Investigation and Resolution, run by existential detectives Bernard Jaffe, (Dustin Hoffman), and his wife Vivian, (Lily Tomlin). He wants them to discover the meaning behind these coincidences. They want him to discover the meaning of life. The couple believes, optimistically, that everything and everyone are connected. They follow Albert 24/7, documenting all that he does, in order to ""figure out his true situation and assist him to resolve his crisis."" He is also hooked up with another man, troubled firefighter Tommy Corn, (Mark Wahlberg), who has not been the same since the ""September thing,"" and rides his motorcycle to fires because he is fiercely anti-petroleum. They are to provide one another with support.La belle Isabelle Huppert plays Caterine, who was once a protege of Tomlin's and Hoffman's but has taken an opposite philosophy - that nothing is connected and life is basically ""random, meaningless and cruel."" She too follows Albert, documenting his behavior to prove her theory is the correct one. Then Brad gets into the act and becomes a client of the Existential Detectives, as does his girlfriend Naomi Watts, model and spokesperson for Huckabees.Director David O. Russell deserves kudos for taking on such a philosophical, almost grandiose project. The actors, some of the best, deserve credit for participating in a risky endeavor. Russell makes some excellent points about the conflicts human beings face at the dawn of the 21st century. The film is intelligent, well acted and directed, interesting, filled with irony and satire - but it doesn't quite work. It becomes too tedious, especially after 105 minutes. There is little action, and lots of surreal dialogue - but it is not taut, it all just sprawls...as in urban. Now, I am not exactly a mainstream moviegoer, but I don't really know if I was entertained or not. Is there cosmic meaning with my dissatisfaction with ""I Heart Huckabees?"" Why is the film not called ""I Luv Huckabees?"" When we see tee-shirts that say ""I Heart NY,"" we know it means ""I Luv NY."" What does ""I heart"" mean?This is a movie that one either loves, or hates - except for me. I can't seem to make up my mind, so I am waffling with a 3 Star rating.JANA",3,"Why Am I Not More Connected To ""I Heart Huckabees?""",1113609600,"04 16, 2005",2005,5249,"['good', 'comedy', 'Heart',

This film is a big orgy of questioning. And who doesn't like questioning? This film, in its own right, is very original and thought provoking that goes above and beyond any form of typicality of films.""Huckabees"" offers us an impressive cast with Dustin Hoffman, Lily Tomlin, Jason Schwartzman, Jude Law, Mark Wahlberg, Isabelle Huppert (one of my favorite international actress's) and Naomi Watts. Most notable performances by, namely, Dustin Hoffman as it's nice to see him in an exceptional role. He hasn't really been given a great script and chance to portray a great character since probably 1997's ""Wag the Dog."" It's very nice to see Hoffman play a great character, as Bernard, the quirky husband half of the existential detectives. Also, most notable is the performance of Mark Wahlberg, as Tommy Corn, another client of the detectives that befriends Albert. Tommy is a fire fighter who has his own environmental concerns as he refuses to ride on the fire truck and rather, rides a bike to the fire saying, ""We'd all be heroes if we stopped using petroleum."" Mark Wahlberg is hilarious in this movie and has his best performance since probably ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Three Kings."" However, this movie is much more of an ensemble performance than anything else. The ensemble's performance in this film is terrific and the chemistry between each character is flawless.The most credit to this movie goes to writer/director David O. Russell. Russell has obviously something going on up there in the cabeza to extract such a story. But the story is amazingly written. The script is out of the ordinary yet genius and comes out as one of the most intelligent films out there and hilarious at that.",4,"I see that ""I Heart the Huckabees"" is meant for a selective audience.",1162425600,"11 2, 2006",2006,2161,"['movie', 'obviously', 'not', 'everyone', 'not', 'comedy', 'just', 'put', 'sit', 'back', 'be', 'shut', 'down', 'old', 'cranium', 'two', 'hour', 'Nope', 'instead', 'get', 'muscle', 'a-cranking', 'Huckabees', 'really', 'pay', 'attention', 'think', 'take', 'everything', 'film', 'several', 'questions', 'mainly', 'dealing', 'connection', 'one', 'person', 'heart', 'soul', 'body', 'other', 'thing', 'existence', 'ever-changing', 'world', 'film', 'big', 'orgy', 'questioning', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'questioning', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'very', 'original', 'thought', 'provoking', 'above', 'form', 'typicality', 'films', 'Huckabees', 'impressive', 'cast', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'one', 'favorite', 'international', 'actress', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Most', 'notable', 'performances', 'namely', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'nice', 'see', 'exceptional', 'role', ""n't"", 'really', 'been', 'given', 'great', 'script', 'chance', 'portray', 'great', 'character', 'probably', '1997', 'Wag', 'Dog', 'very', 'nice', 'see', 'Hoffman', 'play', 'great', 'character', 'Bernard', 'quirky', 'husband', 'half', 'existential', 'detectives', 'Also', 'most', 'notable', 'performance', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Tommy', 'Corn', 'client', 'detectives', 'Albert', 'Tommy', 'fire', 'fighter', 'who', 'own', 'environmental', 'concerns', 'ride', 'fire', 'truck', 'rather', 'bike', 'fire', 'saying', ""'d"", 'be', 'heroes', 'stopped', 'using', 'petroleum', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'best', 'performance', 'probably', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'Three', 'Kings', 'However', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'ensemble', 'performance', 'anything', 'else', 'ensemble', 'performance', 'film', 'terrific', 'chemistry', 'character', 'flawless.The', 'most', 'credit', 'movie', 'writer/director', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'Russell', 'obviously', 'something', 'going', 'cabeza', 'extract', 'such', 'story', 'story', 'amazingly', 'written', 'script', 'ordinary', 'yet', 'genius', 'out', 'one', 'most', 'intelligent', 'films', 'there', 'hilarious']",N/A

Albert (Jason Schwartzman of ""Rushmore"") is an idealistic young conservationist who hires married existentialist detectives (yes, you read that right) to look into the coincidences in his life, determine what they mean, and help him discover the true nature of the universe. He soon buddies up with Tommy (Mark Wahlberg), a fireman who goes around wearing his firefighting boots even when he's not fighting fires and rides a bicycle everywhere he goes because he believes petroleum is evil.Sound bizarre? It is, and a film with these kinds of thought pretensions could easily have gone off the rails, but the stellar cast (including Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin as the detectives and Jude Law as Albert's `nemesis') combined with a strong script keeps it afloat and provides a lot of absurdist fun. If it hasn't become a cult already, ""I Heart Huckabees"" almost certainly will, because it has that kind of offbeat appeal, and this two-disc collection packs on all the extras a devout fan (like me) could wish for.

Coincidences affect individual presence in the now, as society seeks a symbiotic connection with existence.  Activities and behaviors that form under habits and conscious decision-making often are a link reached from self toward society where self generates its own coincidences for other entities.  These connections between the individual and society are lost in a myriad of variably meaningful coincidences that most people let slide by, as more significant happenings occur due to choice or are forced upon the individual.  I Heart Huckabees depicts what could happen if existential detectives would investigate one of these coincidences.Grass root level philosophy in regards to existentialism is brought to the audience's attention through Albert Markovski (Jason Schwartzman) who constantly ponders the incidents happening in his life.  Albert, an environmentalist, frequently writes poetry and seeks to save the marshland where Huckabees plans on building a mall.  At the same time Albert seeks the help of two existential detectives, Vivian (Lily Tomlin) and Bernard (Dustin Hoffman), to find out about one of his coincidences with a tall African-American man that he has bumped into three times.  Bernard gives Albert a lesson in the universe and how everything in the universe is interconnected through a blanket, which in itself is a hilarious scene.  Through the philosophical concept that everything is connected, Vivian and Bernard begin their investigation of Albert's existence, which by the way is done pro-bono.Albert's investigation of his own existence leads him to meet other people while he attempts to finds out why some people have a meaning to his life.  Some of these people are Tommy (Mark Wahlberg), Brad (Jude Law), and Dawn (Naomi Watts) who all have a strong influence in his life.  Tom is a firefighter that has recently broken up his relationship with his wife, as she did not understand his preoccupation of pondering the troubles of the world.  Through work Albert meets Brad, a climbing and smooth talking businessman for Huckabees, who rubs him the wrong way with his flashy style.  Brad's fianc&eacute;e, Dawn, appears in Albert's dreams and visions, as he tries to figure out why the tall black man has emerged in his life. These people seem to hold the secret to his coincidences, which he slowly begins to loose interest in as the big picture becomes more interesting.  The big picture is a comprehensive view of Albert's own life, which has led him to the situations where the coincidences occurred.I Heart Huckabees does not converge as most films do, instead it seems fragmented and jolted.  The fragmentation of the story seems to rest with the philosophical notions that are introduced to the audience.  There are actually two different, yet similar, thoughts presented through the characters.  The existential philosophy, at first, appears to be lucid, but it is far from clear or coherent as the story unfolds.  Albert's meeting with Tommy and later Caterine Vauban (Isabelle Huppert) drifts off into a cerebral rambling where thoughts are diffused and notions dissected.  These thoughts then again joint into unity that continues to be shattered and rejoins over and over again, which gives the idea that everything is connected and disjointed as the same time.  This leaves the viewers with a satirical take on how a mind might diverge in several different directions interchangeably while eventually settling on one thing that does not make any sense to others.I Heart Huckabees is similar to a lot of Spike Jonze films such as Being John Malkovich (1999) and Adaptation (2002).  However, this film does not reach the same seriousness on a cerebral level, but it still offers an amusing comedy with heavy doses of irony.  The amazing cast elevates the film with witty jokes, and funny one-liners.  This is all thanks to the director David O. Russell who in the end brings together a funny script through good filmmaking and daringly taking some good chances.  Ultimately, the bravery pays off with a mind-boggling comedy that brings the audience there, here, and everywhere through many bellyaching coincidences.",5,Coincidences & Existential Satire in Wonderful Comedy...,1109203200,"02 24, 2005",2005,4273,"['Days', 'consist', 'wide', 'variety', 'coincidences', 'planned', 'behaviors', 'make', 'up', 'existence', 'known', 'Coincidences', 'affect', 'individual', 'presence', 'now', 'society', 'symbiotic', 'connection', 'existence', 'Activities', 'behaviors', 'form', 'habits', 'conscious', 'decision-making', 'often', 'are', 'link', 'reached', 'self', 'society', 'where', 'self', 'own', 'coincidences', 'other', 'entities', 'connections', 'individual', 'society', 'are', 'lost', 'myriad', 'variably', 'meaningful', 'coincidences', 'most', 'people', 'let', 'slide', 'more', 'significant', 'happenings', 'occur', 'due', 'choice', 'are', 'forced', 'individual', 'Heart', 'depicts', 'what', 'could', 'happen', 'existential', 'detectives', 'would', 'investigate', 'one', 'coincidences.Grass', 'root', 'level', 'philosophy', 'regards', 'existentialism', 'brought', 'audience', 'attention', 'Albert', 'Markovski', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'who', 'constantly', 'incidents', 'happening', 'life', 'Albert', 'environmentalist', 'frequently', 'poetry', 'save', 'marshland', 'where', 'Huckabees', 'building', 'mall', 'same', 'time', 'Albert', 'help', 'two', 'existential', 'detectives', 'Vivian', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'Bernard', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'find', 'out', 'one', 'coincidences', 'tall', 'African-American', 'man', 'bumped', 'three', 'times', 'Bernard', 'Albert', 'lesson', 'universe', 'how', 'everything', 'universe', 'interconnected', 'blanket', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'philosophical', 'concept', 'everything', 'connected', 'Vivian', 'Bernard', 'begin', 'investigation', 'Albert', 'existence', 'way', 'done', 'pro-bono.Albert', 'investigation', 'own', 'existence', 'meet', 'other', 'people', 'finds', 'out', 'why', 'people', 'have', 'meaning', 'life', 'people', 'are', 'Tommy', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Brad', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Dawn', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'who', 'have', 'strong', 'influence', 'life', 'Tom', 'firefighter', 'recently', 'broken', 'up', 'relationship', 'wife', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'preoccupation', 'pondering', 'troubles', 'world', 'work', 'Albert', 'Brad', 'climbing', 'smooth', 'talking', 'businessman', 'Huckabees', 'who', 'rubs', 'wrong', 'way', 'flashy', 'style', 'Brad', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Dawn', 'Albert', 'dreams', 'visions', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'tall', 'black', 'man', 'emerged', 'life', 'people', 'seem', 'hold', 'secret', 'coincidences', 'slowly', 'loose', 'interest', 'big', 'picture', 'more', 'interesting', 'big', 'picture', 'comprehensive', 'view', 'Albert', 'own', 'life', 'led', 'situations', 'where', 'coincidences', 'occurred.I', 'Heart', 'Huckabees', 'not', 'converge', 'most', 'films', 'do', 'instead', 'fragmented', 'jolted', 'fragmentation', 'story', 'rest', 'philosophical', 'notions', 'are', 'introduced', 'audience', 'are', 'actually', 'two', 'different', 'yet', 'similar', 'thoughts', 'presented', 'characters', 'existential', 'philosophy', 'first', 'be', 'lucid', 'far', 'clear', 'coherent', 'story', 'unfolds', 'Albert', 'meeting', 'Tommy', 'later', 'Caterine', 'Vauban', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'off', 'cerebral', 'rambling', 'where', 'thoughts', 'are', 'diffused', 'notions', 'dissected', 'thoughts', 'then', 'again', 'joint', 'unity', 'be', 'shattered', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'idea', 'everything', 'connected', 'disjointed', 'same', 'time', 'viewers', 'satirical', 'take', 'how', 'mind', 'might', 'diverge', 'several', 'different', 'directions', 'interchangeably', 'eventually', 'settling', 'one', 'thing', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'others.I', 'Heart', 'Huckabees', 'similar', 'lot', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'films', 'such', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', '1999', 'Adaptation', '2002', 'However', 'film', 'not', 'reach', 'same', 'seriousness', 'cerebral', 'level', 'still', 'amusing', 'comedy', 'heavy', 'doses', 'irony', 'amazing', 'cast', 'film', 'witty', 'jokes', 'funny', 'one-liners', 'thanks', 'director', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'who', 'end', 'together', 'funny', 'script', 'good', 'filmmaking', 'daringly', 'taking', 'good', 'chances', 'Ultimately', 'bravery', 'mind-boggling', 'comedy', 'audience', 'there', 'here', 'everywhere', 'many', 'bellyaching', 'coincidences']",N/A

The film is well done; the only qualm I have about it is that things develop rapidly at certain points in the movie. The acting is very convincing; and the casting couldn't have been done any better. The choreography and cinematography are terrific; and the musical score enhances the film as well.When the action starts (and there's plenty of it), Albert Markovski (Jason Schwartzman) is puzzled by a coincidence that he believes could have great meaning and maybe even say something about his existence here on Earth. What is Albert's coincidence? He meets a tall, slender black man (Stephen Nimieri played by Ger Duany) three times in three locations; Albert is confused about what this coincidence might mean. Albert also wouldn't mind discovering the meaning of life and even the universe in general. Thus Albert goes to husband and wife team Bernard (Dustin Hoffman) and Vivian (Lily Tomlin) who are existential detectives; they will spy on him so he can find out the meaning of his coincidence and more.But not only do Bernard and Vivian spy on Albert, they also act as a type of existentialist therapist team; they want Albert to discover more about himself and the universe using unusual methods like placing Albert is what seems to be a zipper/body bag; and Bernard shows Albert the meaning of what appears to be a simple white blanket. As the plot moves along we see what develops as Albert tries so hard to find out the answers to his questions.Of course, things are even more complicated. Enter firefighter and environmentalist Tommy Corn (Mark Wahlberg) who gets involved with Bernard, Vivian and their professional nemesis Caterine Vauban (Isabelle Huppert); and Brad Stand (Jude Law) also becomes a client of Bernard and Vivian's although Brad is primarily worried about his climb up the corporate ladder at Huckabees, a department store supposedly teaming up with Albert's activist group Open Spaces so Huckabees can look good in the public eye.There is more to the plot that I'll leave out so you can enjoy this as much as I did! I think the best way to view this film is as a quirky comedy that pokes fun at existentialism; philosophy; therapy; people desperate to know the meaning of life and their place in the universe; the ongoing battle between philosophers and even therapists with different points of view; environmentalists; models going through personal crises (like Dawn Campbell played by Naomi Watts) and more. There is also a brief cameo by Shania Twain.I Heart Huckabees is a 2 DVD set. There are 2 rather interesting optional running commentaries on the first DVD; the second DVD includes 22 deleted/extended scenes with outtakes; a production documentary; a ""detective infomercial;"" a music video I really liked; a ""Charlie Rose Show"" interview with director/co-writer David O. Russell--and more!I Heart Huckabees is a great film with many, many funny moments that had me laughing out loud. As someone who has been both a counselor and a counseling patient, I found the way the film pokes fun at people's personal issues and philosophies to be hysterical and not at all offensive.

874252,A152C8GYY25HAH,B0006TPE4C,Matthew Horner,"[2, 8]","""I Heart Huckabees"" is a screwball comedy for the early 21st Century. Director David O. Russell, whose ""Three Kings"" is one of my favorite movies, tries valiantly to update the genre but ultimately fails in his attempt. This doesn't mean that it isn't funny, which it often is, or that a small group of hardcore fans won't make it a cult classic one day. I simply feel that its deficits outweigh its assets.Albert [Jason Schwartzman] is a key member of an environmentalist group which is trying to save a wetland. Brad [Jude Law], a PR man for Huckabees, a Target-like department store chain, understands that it would be good for the corporation's image to hook up with the group. All sorts of mayhem follows, including Albert's loss of identity. He resorts to a pair of Existentialist detectives [Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin] to help him to `find' himself. [So much for plot. Screwball comedies are not about plot, anyway!]The movie is a send up of corporate sponsorship, media events, shallow relationships, existentialism and quantum physics, among other things. In these areas it succeeds brilliantly. Where it fails is in providing any warmth to the characters. In the classic screwball comedies of the 1930s, the satire and the ridiculousness succeeded, in part, because the characters were delightful and loveable. The audience was right there with them.

Mark Wahlberg is great, as is Jason Schwartsman, and while Jude Law gives a good performance, he does tend to become a little irritating, character-wise.It's a movie I really enjoyed.  You have to give it props for originality.  It tackles the existentialism and not only gives you different believable points of view and theories, but it's not too serious.  There's a certain underlying comedic relief that comes from just the situation the characters find themselves in in general.  Dustin Hoffman and his counterpart were hilarious.The comedic relief works well, as it doesn't take attention from all the theories that are being tried out, it doesn't make them ridiculous, but at the same time it helps the movie not seem too long.Overall, it's a great movie if you're up for some philosophical reflection on your existence.

874265,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B0006TPE4C,Nicholas Carroll,"[18, 24]","This film is one of my favorites for 2004.  It was funny and brilliant, and perfectly on the mark regarding psychology.  There are a few flaws in the film, minor ones that if changed could possibly have reached a wider audience, but its still very much worth seeing over and over.For anyone who's considered taking therapy or is in one now, see this film instead.  The $20 or so you spend on this dvd will be well worth spent after all the money and time spent on therapy.  The reason is because this film gives you all the secrets that you'll only pay big bucks to hear from a ""professional"".  Whatever existential problem one has, the first step to correcting it is to look for the deeper and hidden connection that separates one from another.  What stories to we repeat over and over to other people, and why do we repeat the same stories over and over?  We see examples of this from many angles in this film.The film begins with obscenity as Jason Schwartzman is heard swearing over and over before we see him.  As the film rolls along, we learn that Schwartzman is an environmentalist with serious problems (bad hair supposedly isn't one of them).  He recognizes a coincidence of seeing the same tall African man on three seperate occasions and this leads him to seek out Existential Detectives, played brilliantly by Lily Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman (both with equally bad hair).  To get to their office, one has to walk a labyrinthian hallway, and this was cleverly done (read Joseph Campbell's ""The Hero With A Thousand Faces"" to find out the purpose of labyrinthes).The Detectives follow Schwartzman around to get clues into his life, both internal and external.  Hoffman focuses on his inner conflicts, and Tomlin focuses on the minutaie of his life.  What they find out is that there are some serious conflicts that need addressing regarding Schwartzman's animosity towards golden boy Jude Law, who is a rising star at the Huckabees retail chain (think cross between Walmart and Target).  Jude Law perfectly plays a man with everything going for him...good looks, a hot girlfriend (who is the covergirl face of Huckabees), a rising career, famous connections, a house and an SUV.  He is dripping with charisma and Schwartzman hates him for it.We are also introduced to Mark Wahlberg in an amusing role as a fireman who obsesses over oil after the events of 9/11.  He repeats to anyone and everyone about the impending oil crisis and our oil-dependent lifestyle, but that too is a cry for help, as it has lead to ruinous relationships (confusing his young daughter who doesn't know what to do about the things he points out).  When Wahlberg and Schwartzman are paired up as partners, they fall out of Existential Detectives' influence, taking a liking to the more sadistic rival, played brilliantly by French actress Isabelle Huppert.  She gives them both a lesson in how petty drama distracts people from seeing the truth of their infinite nature and the existential problems that plague all of us.As the film rolls along, we see all the drama play out and how characters will lie to try and fool the Existential Detectives, but the joke's on them.  Seeing how Jude Law becomes unraveled once his jovial facade is punctured by the detectives, as well as how Schwartzman's existential angst is traced back to an event in childhood is just amazing to watch.  This film is so right on with the psychology books I've read and my own ponderings into my inner life.  People should see this film over and over and use the information presented to examine their own inner nature.  It will lead to some profound conclusions.  Its a shame this film wasn't discovered by more people in theaters.  I think it would make an excellent TV series as Existential Detectives take on new clients each week, as viewers learn about how important events from our past affect our perception of the world and how we view others and ourselves.  My favorite line in the film is when Naomi Watts tells Jude Law something like ""you just can't deal with my infinite nature!""  Brilliant.  The music is also a perfect match for the film.  If you're buying this DVD, you'll want the soundtrack as well.  Its perfect to listen to, especially on a bad day when you need some cheering up.  Buy both...you'll LOVE Huckabees!",5,Absolutely Brilliant and perfectly on the mark!!!,1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,4297,"['film', 'one', 'favorites', '2004', 'was', 'funny', 'brilliant', 'perfectly', 'mark', 'regarding', 'psychology', 'are', 'few', 'flaws', 'film', 'minor', 'ones', 'changed', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'reached', 'wider', 'audience', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'seeing', 'over.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'considered', 'taking', 'therapy', 'one', 'now', 'see', 'film', 'instead', '20', 'so', 'spend', 'dvd', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'worth', 'spent', 'money', 'time', 'spent', 'therapy', 'reason', 'film', 'secrets', ""'ll"", 'only', 'pay', 'big', 'bucks', 'hear', 'professional', 'existential', 'problem', 'one', 'first', 'step', 'correcting', 'look', 'deeper', 'hidden', 'connection', 'one', 'What', 'repeat', 'other', 'people', 'why', 'do', 'repeat', 'same', 'stories', 'see', 'examples', 'many', 'angles', 'film.The', 'film', 'obscenity', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'heard', 'swearing', 'see', 'film', 'rolls', 'along', 'learn', 'Schwartzman', 'environmentalist', 'serious', 'problems', 'bad', 'hair', 'supposedly', ""n't"", 'one', 'coincidence', 'seeing', 'same', 'tall', 'African', 'man', 'three', 'seperate', 'occasions', 'seek', 'out', 'Existential', 'Detectives', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'equally', 'bad', 'hair', 'get', 'office', 'one', 'walk', 'labyrinthian', 'hallway', 'was', 'cleverly', 'done', 'read', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'Hero', 'A', 'Thousand', 'Faces', 'find', 'out', 'purpose', 'labyrinthes', '.The', 'Detectives', 'follow', 'Schwartzman', 'get', 'clues', 'life', 'internal', 'external', 'Hoffman', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'Tomlin', 'minutaie', 'life', 'What', 'find', 'out', 'are', 'serious', 'conflicts', 'need', 'addressing', 'regarding', 'Schwartzman', 'animosity', 'towards', 'golden', 'boy', 'Jude', 'Law', 'who', 'rising', 'star', 'Huckabees', 'retail', 'chain', 'think', 'cross', 'Walmart', 'Target', 'Jude', 'Law', 'perfectly', 'man', 'everything', 'going', 'good', 'looks', 'hot', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'covergirl', 'face', 'Huckabees', 'rising', 'career', 'famous', 'connections', 'house', 'SUV', 'dripping', 'charisma', 'Schwartzman', 'it.We', 'are', 'also', 'introduced', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'amusing', 'role', 'fireman', 'who', 'oil', 'events', '9/11', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'impending', 'oil', 'crisis', 'oil-dependent', 'lifestyle', 'too', 'cry', 'help', 'lead', 'ruinous', 'relationships', 'confusing', 'young', 'daughter', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'things', 'out', 'When', 'Wahlberg', 'Schwartzman', 'are', 'paired', 'up', 'partners', 'fall', 'Existential', 'Detectives', 'influence', 'taking', 'liking', 'more', 'sadistic', 'rival', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'French', 'actress', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'lesson', 'how', 'petty', 'drama', 'people', 'seeing', 'truth', 'infinite', 'nature', 'existential', 'problems', 'plague', 'us.As', 'film', 'rolls', 'along', 'see', 'drama', 'play', 'out', 'how', 'characters', 'will', 'lie', 'try', 'fool', 'Existential', 'Detectives', 'joke', 'Seeing', 'how', 'Jude', 'Law', 'unraveled', 'once', 'jovial', 'facade', 'punctured', 'detectives', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'Schwartzman', 'existential', 'angst', 'traced', 'back', 'event', 'childhood', 'just', 'amazing', 'watch', 'film', 'so', 'right', 'psychology', 'books', ""'ve"", 'read', 'own', 'ponderings', 'inner', 'life', 'People', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'use', 'information', 'presented', 'examine', 'own', 'inner', 'nature', 'will', 'lead', 'profound', 'conclusions', 'shame', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'discovered', 'more', 'people', 'theaters', 'think', 'would', 'make', 'excellent', 'TV', 'series', 'Existential', 'Detectives', 'take', 'new', 'clients', 'week', 'viewers', 'learn', 'how', 'important', 'events', 'past', 'affect', 'perception', 'world', 'how', 'view', 'others', 'favorite', 'line', 'film', 'when', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Jude', 'Law', 'something', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deal', 'infinite', 'nature', 'Brilliant', 'music', 'also', 'perfect', 'match', 'film', ""'re"", 'buying', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'want', 'soundtrack', 'as', 'well', 'perfect', 'listen', 'especially', 'bad', 'day', 'when', 'need', 'cheering', 'up', 'Buy', ""'ll"", 'LOVE', 'Huckabees']",N/A

874268,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B0006TPE4C,Only-A-Child,"[3, 6]","Wow, who would have imagined that ""I &#9829; Huckabees"" would have so many favorable comments.  Apparently there are a lot of people who were able to read this film, something that I found difficult.  Of course I was somewhat distracted trying to decide if it was Jude Law or Freddie Prinze Jr. as the corporate PR guy (very scary resemblance).Since this is an adult version of ""Harriet the Spy"", those who liked that film as kids might have had an advantage when processing their first viewing of ""Huckabees"". The themes of friendship, accommodation, and perseverance are central to both films and in both films it is necessary to sort through a lot of other stuff before it becomes clear what the film is trying to show us.(Along with ""Harriet"") ""Chinatown"" and ""Casablanca"" influenced ""Huckabees"" message and style. Like ""Chinatown"" the events revolve around a detective's office and the audience stays a few steps behind the narrative. And like ""Casablanca"" a background of ordinary events serves as a stage for the discussion and attempted resolution of very significant issues. The title is a metaphor, ""Huckabees"" is a Walmart-like store whose ubiquitousness is turning the country into a strip mall. Since little girls in Third World countries are going blind supplying product for the store, shopping at Huckabees is to blind oneself to injustice. Meaning that we face a moral choice of choosing to recognize the truth and live in a state of guilt and paralysis or ignore the truth and exist inside a bright lie that would almost be perfect-except we must shut down our brains to maintain the illusion. The latter state illustrated by those driving SUV's who expressed surprise and outrage over the events of 9/11.The message is that apparent reality is not the total reality and how limited we are in our ability to understand any of it (insert ""Mona Lisa Smile"" here). Another of the themes is that you must give up a little to get a little, that ego prevents us from connecting.In retrospect it is amazing that the film was ever made and that it was made with a relatively large ($20MM) budget.  Comparing what is on the screen to ""Napoleon Dynamite"" (made for a fraction of the money),  it is hard to see where the $20MM went, except to pay the name cast who probably would have worked for free on this as a labor of love.  It must have been obvious from the beginning that ""Huckabees"" would lose money.It was also obvious that the film would fail in delivering its ambitious message.  Not because it is poorly written, but because the material is too complicated for the medium.  Which makes this a good time to praise the commentary sections that are on most recent DVD's.  DVD commentaries's are the most revolutionary film-making development since sound.  They give directors and screenwriters a footnote device that encourages multiple viewings and allows them to help audiences read their films.  Since only a fraction of viewers utilize this feature, it has not yet changed the way a film is shot and assembled, so at least for the short term there is no downside.  There are two commentaries on the ""I &#9829; Huckabees"" DVD and they are essential to appreciating this film.  So much so that those who missed seeing it in theaters might have been fortunate because now they will have quick access to this resource.Although David Russell pokes fun at how we take ourselves too seriously, he is also trying to reach us with a message that will help us keep life in a better-balanced perspective and keep us aggressively examining everything we discover in the process of living.  This message element was a much more important motivation to him than the satire element.What makes the Huckabees' parody unique is that none of the philosophical positions are actually absurdist (all are worthy of consideration) or even particularly exaggerated, the fun comes from the characters' total conviction that only their ideas are correct.  And what saves this thing from being the most pretentious film of all time is that Russell does not plug any concept other than keeping an open mind.Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",4,SUV For Sale,1114387200,"04 25, 2005",2005,4146,"['Wow', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'imagined', '9829', 'Huckabees', 'would', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'favorable', 'comments', 'Apparently', 'are', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'able', 'read', 'film', 'something', 'found', 'difficult', 'course', 'was', 'somewhat', 'distracted', 'trying', 'decide', 'was', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'corporate', 'PR', 'guy', 'very', 'scary', 'resemblance', '.Since', 'adult', 'version', 'Harriet', 'Spy', 'who', 'liked', 'film', 'kids', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'advantage', 'when', 'processing', 'first', 'viewing', 'Huckabees', 'themes', 'friendship', 'accommodation', 'perseverance', 'are', 'central', 'films', 'films', 'necessary', 'sort', 'lot', 'other', 'stuff', 'clear', 'what', 'film', 'trying', 'show', 'Harriet', 'Chinatown', 'Casablanca', 'influenced', 'Huckabees', 'message', 'style', 'Chinatown', 'events', 'revolve', 'detective', 'office', 'audience', 'few', 'steps', 'narrative', 'Casablanca', 'background', 'ordinary', 'events', 'stage', 'discussion', 'attempted', 'resolution', 'very', 'significant', 'issues', 'title', 'metaphor', 'Huckabees', 'Walmart-like', 'store', 'ubiquitousness', 'turning', 'country', 'strip', 'mall', 'little', 'girls', 'Third', 'World', 'countries', 'are', 'going', 'supplying', 'product', 'store', 'shopping', 'Huckabees', 'blind', 'injustice', 'Meaning', 'face', 'moral', 'choice', 'choosing', 'recognize', 'truth', 'live', 'state', 'guilt', 'paralysis', 'ignore', 'truth', 'exist', 'bright', 'lie', 'would', 'almost', 'be', 'perfect-except', 'must', 'shut', 'down', 'brains', 'maintain', 'illusion', 'latter', 'state', 'illustrated', 'driving', 'SUV', 'who', 'expressed', 'surprise', 'outrage', 'events', '9/11.The', 'message', 'apparent', 'reality', 'not', 'total', 'reality', 'how', 'limited', 'are', 'ability', 'understand', 'insert', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'here', 'themes', 'must', 'give', 'up', 'little', 'get', 'little', 'ego', 'prevents', 'connecting.In', 'retrospect', 'amazing', 'film', 'was', 'ever', 'made', 'was', 'made', 'relatively', 'large', '20MM', 'budget', 'Comparing', 'what', 'screen', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'made', 'fraction', 'money', 'hard', 'see', 'where', '20MM', 'went', 'pay', 'name', 'cast', 'who', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'free', 'labor', 'love', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'obvious', 'beginning', 'Huckabees', 'would', 'lose', 'money.It', 'was', 'also', 'obvious', 'film', 'would', 'fail', 'delivering', 'ambitious', 'message', 'Not', 'poorly', 'written', 'material', 'too', 'complicated', 'medium', 'Which', 'good', 'time', 'praise', 'commentary', 'sections', 'are', 'most', 'recent', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'commentaries', 'are', 'most', 'revolutionary', 'film-making', 'development', 'sound', 'give', 'directors', 'screenwriters', 'footnote', 'device', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'help', 'audiences', 'read', 'films', 'only', 'fraction', 'viewers', 'utilize', 'feature', 'not', 'yet', 'changed', 'way', 'film', 'shot', 'assembled', 'so', 'least', 'short', 'term', 'downside', 'are', 'two', 'commentaries', '9829', 'Huckabees', 'DVD', 'are', 'essential', 'appreciating', 'film', 'So', 'much', 'who', 'missed', 'seeing', 'theaters', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'fortunate', 'because', 'now', 'will', 'have', 'quick', 'access', 'resource.Although', 'David', 'Russell', 'fun', 'how', 'take', 'ourselves', 'too', 'seriously', 'also', 'trying', 'reach', 'message', 'will', 'help', 'keep', 'life', 'better-balanced', 'perspective', 'keep', 'aggressively', 'examining', 'everything', 'discover', 'process', 'living', 'message', 'element', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'motivation', 'satire', 'Huckabees', 'parody', 'unique', 'none', 'philosophical', 'positions', 'are', 'actually', 'absurdist', 'are', 'worthy', 'consideration', 'even', 'particularly', 'exaggerated', 'fun', 'characters', 'total', 'conviction', 'only', 'ideas', 'are', 'correct', 'what', 'thing', 'being', 'most', 'pretentious', 'film', 'time', 'Russell', 'not', 'plug', 'concept', 'other', 'keeping', 'open', 'mind.Then', 'again', 'what', 'do', 'know', ""'m"", 'only', 'child']",N/A

I was reluctlant to like it at first since I think most of the aforementioned films failed to live up to their hype, and I figured this film had much of the same fan base, but I softened up to it pretty fast and never felt like it was trying to put one over on me. Well the scene with Albert and Katerine dunking each others heads in mud was a head scratcher, as was Katerine inexplicably getting into the parents apartment without them seeing her. The search for the ""meaning of life"" isn't that intrusive on the plot, any time it comes up it's used more for comedy than insight.The hypothesis that everything is ""connected"" isn't defined in terms that allow it to be tested within the context of established reality and therefore does not warrant addressing. I thought the possibility that the detectives' philisophical gibberish was supposed to be meaningful could be safely disregarded, given the fact that Albert, the main character, expressed the viewer reaction of not comprehending the meaning of what they were saying. Albert is the star, not the detectives, so it seems obvious to view Albert's perspective as the one intended to have the most resonance with viewers. If you consider the existensial detectives to be insane gibberish talkers, as Albert seems to most of the time, the issue of whether what they're saying offers profound philisophical insight or not is irrelevant. The purpose the detective characters serve is to provide an atmosphere of lunacy, the details of what they're saying being insignificant to the overall focus of the movie. It's a movie driven by quirky characters and comedic dialogue rather than the conceptual philisophical backdrop. It has a similar comedic approach to Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Home Movies. The scenes where the detectives are introducing their theories to Albert are funny in exactly the same way as the scenes of Frylock arguing with the Mooninites in ATHF.

They have been releasing some great movies and I Heart Huckabees is no exception to that.This was another weird, ""thinking man's"" type comedy. I will admit that with the humor being so dry, sometimes it is hard to realize that they are in fact making jokes. Movies that are on somewhat of an even keel would be The Royal Tenenbaums and The Life Aquatic. That is not to say that if you did not enjoy those you will not like I Heart Huckabees either.The cast was very good; including but not limited to Jason Schwartzman, Dustin Hoffman, Lily Tomlin, Naomi Watts, Mark Wahlberg, Jude Law and Isabelle Huppert.The basic premise is Jason Schwartzman's character being caught in the middle of a feud between existentialism and nihilism as his life begins to spiral out of control. He simply seeks the meaning of his ""coincidence"". He has had three sightings of the same doorman around town. He wants to know the significance. That is why he seeks out the detectives. Along the way, the detectives attempt to address his battle with Jude Law's character. Isabelle Huppert plays a French author who teaches the opposite end of the spectrum from Hoffman and Tomlin. Is it that we are all the same? Or is it that we are all nothing and all that exists is chaos?""How am I not myself?"" The movie follows a few characters as they ask some pretty hard hitting questions.Playing Schwartzman's ""other"", Mark Wahlberg's performance was the highlight for me.

I found the film to be hilarious and very interesting, with some great performances.  But, despite the ""realist"" message of the film, I feel the burden of existence, more specifically, existentialism, which stresses accountability for one's actions and places us humans firmly in the driver's seat.  This film doesn't really take itself seriously, but it's hard for me not to take IT seriously.The narrative is fairly free-form, but it makes a lot more sense on the second viewing, once you are familiar with it's logic and theme.  It's different.  It does have a similar sense of humor as Being John Malkovich and Royal Tenenbaums.  Perhaps we're in a renaissance of intelligent and thought-provoking comedies.  And who says all American films are crap these days?Mark Wahlberg turns in a brilliant performance as an angry and disillusioned firefighter.  All the leads are really great actually.  They represent different facets of humanity.  The central duality of the two main characters is the crux that drives the plot.  Jude Law represents callous industrialism, (""progress""), while Jason Schwartzmann is idealistic altruism (""earth first"").  As the film says, we are all one and so are the two main characters.What do you do after you see ""I Heart Huckabees?""  I couldn't go to sleep without writing something down, trying to make sense of what I had just seen.  If you accept the challenge of this film, if you don't schluf it off as an ""audacious mess"" as the Amazon critic wrote, you may be rewarded, but it could weigh heavy on your mind.Well, this has been a rambling review.  As someone posted on IMDB, all existentialism did for Jean-Paul Sartre was make him confused and miserable his whole life, despite being brilliant, famous and beloved.

It's about a frustrated activist and idealist who can't even keep control of his group from a friendlier corporate figure that co opts them... and it's about his struggle at the same time with the meaning of life. This character, Albert, also connects with a ""existential"" detective agency by accident... these people are like life coaches except they take it much farther in trying to get him to achieve Buddhist like enlightenment. They're played delightfully by Lily Tomlin, and Dustin Hoffman in a wig that's in my opinion one of the funniest parts of the movie.While it's an admirable try to pull off a thinking man's comedy, if you've seen a Wes Anderson movie it's a lot harder to get into. This ""surreal"" comic reality just doesn't bend surreal enough or real enough... it doesn't find a believable space of it's own you can just let go and enjoy. Stylistically, where something like The Royal Tennenbaums is both relentlessly charming and emotional.. Huckabees isn't really either. It's just trying to get through all the ""meaning of life"" jazz and philosophy to the point the movie has no place to go with the characters but that.

It's bizarre in the extreme, but I mean that in a good way.  It's like nothing you've ever seen before.  It takes screenwriting to a new level.  Maybe that sounds a tad pretentious, but sorry, it's true.I can't imagine how they sold it.  To the suits, I mean.  I can't even imagine how the script reads, how one can make sense of it on paper.  But I'm glad someone did, because the result was a stunningly-original film.But how do I describe it?  I can't.I'm not the only one with this problem.  I read the back of the box in the video store: it made no sense.  I read some capsule summaries on the Internet Movie Database: they made no sense either.  It's very stream-of-conscious, proceeds more by gut instinct than by logic.  Basically, but not entirely, I [Heart] Huckabees is a philosophical discourse where the various existential elements are personified and characterized.  And these existential elements get into arguments with each other.  If you're the type of person who thinks matters of importance through only to have your own brain argue with itself, to hear little voices competing for your psyche's attention, then you'll understand this movie.  If you aren't that type of person, you may find yourself, like many (Roger Ebert, James Berardinelli) feeling on the outside, frustrated that you can't crack the code and get ""into"" this movie.  From the first frame I had no trouble identifyinjg with these extremely strange situations.  But many will, and it's understandable.  I'll skip all the obvious jokes about how maybe the right drugs will help.  This movie is like a drug.  And you may have a bad reaction to it.  Or not.But how do I describe it?  I can't.  Just rent it.  The performances are a joy, except maybe oddly for Dustin Hoffman, who never really seems to find a unique voice to match his unique haircut.  Paired with Lily Tomlin, she blows him off the screen seemingly without trying.  Jason Schwartzman and Mark Wahlberg are wonderful as the screwball main protagonists--Schwartzman in particular shines in this sort of offbeat role.  Isabelle Huppert made me laugh just by her what-is-she-doing-here presence, but I couldn't tell you why.  Ditto Naomi Watts.You can read all the reviews you want of this film, but they won't do it justice.  You'll either hate it or it will blow your mind.  Ebert didn't like it, but he didn't like Brazil either, and for many the same reasons.  For him, neither film ""made sense.""  For me, they come from deep within our psyches, and owe more to the irrational than to anything in the neocortex.

874292,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0006TPE4C,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 10]","Director David O. Russel categorically says in his interview with the Japanese press that ""I Heart Huckabees' is a comedy.""  At the same time, he makes it clear that the film is greatly influenced by Uma Thurman's daddy and his mentor, Robert Thurman, Professor of Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Studies at Columbia University.What kind of film do you expect from this premise?  Roger Ebert just didn't get it.  Several reviewers of the respected British newspapers gave this film the lowest rating.  Me?  I still don't know.  Please, Amazon, give us 'I Prefer Not To Vote' button for rating, and I will click that.I admit, 'I Heart Huckabees' has some funny bits.  Jason Schwartzman is Albert, avid activist who fights to preserve nature (in his case, forest, swamp, and a rock ... yes, a rock) from the big company's development.  And he reads his own poems before the local press as statement.  But Albert is also intrigued by the possibility of some hidden law surrounding his life, for he encountered the same tall guy from Africa at three different places.  Does this signify anything?From then, the film starts to show its unique (superficially at least) aspect.  The husband and wife detective team Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin take up the ""case"" of this client, and they maintain that his experience can be interpreted in another way.  Albert is given a therapy (kind of), and then the team starts to ""investigate"" the case of the client.  In this case, his own life.But their investigation is no ordinary one, not only openly following him and setting cameras and microphones in Albert's office, but also gives influences to the people around Albert, including Mark Wahlberg's fire fighter who hates the idea of using oil (and he refuses to hop on the fire engine); Jude Law's sweet-talking elite businessman working for Huckabees; and Naomi Watts' lovely, very lovely model (yes, her fans, she is).  To make the entangled relations more complicated, another philosopher Isabelle Huppert flies from France, and this seductive teacher leads some of the characters to the uncharted territories for them (and for the philosophical detective team).  Her lessons include one of the dirtiest love scenes in the movie history.So is this funny?  Sometimes, yes.  But Russell's lofty aim to make a comedy out of philosophy ends up with a pretentious film, with many annoyingly talky sequences which I find it hard to follow.  Or am I too slow?  Perhaps, and perhaps I am too unkind, but anyway the film's biggest problem is, like in his previous film 'Three Kings,' all of Russell's characters appear as caricature, and then suddenly start to act like human.  With skilled hand (of Woody Allen, for instance), the comical and the philosophical go together well.  David O. Russell only relies on the charms of his quirky characters, which are considerable, it is true, but not good enough to sustain the running time of a feature film.I'm not saying 'I Heart Huckabees' is terrible.  Far from it.  I say this is not my cup of tea, and perhap you may feel the same way.

While some found its offbeat humor and deliberately confusing philosophy to be enjoyable, others were flabbergasted.  The film ended up being a box office disappointment, and it's easy to see why- this was certainly not something made for mainstream success (in fact, when I saw this in theaters, at least four people had walked out by the halfway point).  Why people would despise this movie while enjoying the obnoxiously dumb summer blockbusters (OK, some are enjoyable) is beyond me.  My only guess is people hated this movie because they ""didn't get it.""  The point is, that's kind of the point.""I Heart Huckabees"" dives incredibly deep into two competing types of philosophy, and neither is very comprehensible except at the basic level.  I believe that the filmmakers did not intend for the ideas in this movie to be taken seriously, and that it was funny the characters in the film did so.  If you're willing to accept that most of the ""big ideas"" in this movie are inane and meaningless, then you will likely find yourself enjoying it.The movies works because it never loses sight of the fact that it's a comedy (one thing that drove me crazy about ""Life Aquatic"" was that it took an inherently silly concept and tried to squeeze drama out of it).  While there aren't many laugh-out-loud moments in ""Huckabees,"" there are plenty of chuckles and grins.  Mark Wahlberg in particular is amusing as a petroleum-obsessed firefighter, and his ""ball thing"" scene is a classic.  The other actors all aquaint themselves nicely to their roles- Jason Schwartzman makes for a funny lead, while Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin are given a chance to let loose their comedic sides.  Only Jude Law irritates, partly because he's been given a phony American accent here (compare this to his superior one in ""Road to Perdition"").""I Heart Huckabees"" worked for me overall.  True, director David O. Russel does not strike the gold that he did with ""Three Kings,"" but he isn't aiming that high, to be fair.  What ""Huckabees"" is good for is a night of laughs, provided that you're willing to think a little and accept the absurdity of everything.",4,An entertaining romp of philosophy,1110672000,"03 13, 2005",2005,2226,"['When', 'was', 'released', 'theatrically', 'Heart', 'Huckabees', 'was', 'given', 'decidedly', 'mixed', 'response', 'found', 'offbeat', 'humor', 'deliberately', 'confusing', 'philosophy', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'others', 'were', 'flabbergasted', 'film', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'box', 'office', 'disappointment', 'easy', 'see', 'why-', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'something', 'made', 'mainstream', 'success', 'fact', 'when', 'saw', 'theaters', 'least', 'four', 'people', 'had', 'walked', 'out', 'halfway', 'point', 'Why', 'people', 'would', 'despise', 'movie', 'enjoying', 'obnoxiously', 'dumb', 'summer', 'blockbusters', 'OK', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'only', 'guess', 'people', 'hated', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'point', 'kind', 'point', 'Heart', 'Huckabees', 'incredibly', 'deep', 'two', 'competing', 'types', 'philosophy', 'very', 'comprehensible', 'basic', 'level', 'believe', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'not', 'intend', 'ideas', 'movie', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'was', 'funny', 'characters', 'film', 'did', 'so', ""'re"", 'willing', 'accept', 'most', 'big', 'ideas', 'movie', 'are', 'inane', 'meaningless', 'then', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'enjoying', 'it.The', 'movies', 'never', 'sight', 'fact', 'comedy', 'one', 'thing', 'drove', 'crazy', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'was', 'took', 'inherently', 'silly', 'concept', 'tried', 'squeeze', 'drama', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'Huckabees', 'are', 'plenty', 'chuckles', 'grins', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'particular', 'amusing', 'petroleum-obsessed', 'firefighter', 'ball', 'thing', 'scene', 'classic', 'other', 'actors', 'aquaint', 'nicely', 'roles-', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'funny', 'lead', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'are', 'given', 'chance', 'let', 'loose', 'comedic', 'sides', 'Only', 'Jude', 'Law', 'partly', 'been', 'given', 'phony', 'American', 'accent', 'here', 'compare', 'superior', 'one', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'Heart', 'Huckabees', 'worked', 'overall', 'True', 'director', 'David', 'O.', 'Russel', 'not', 'strike', 'gold', 'did', 'Three', 'Kings', ""n't"", 'aiming', 'high', 'be', 'fair', 'What', 'Huckabees', 'good', 'night', 'laughs', 'provided', ""'re"", 'willing', 'think', 'little', 'accept', 'absurdity', 'everything']",N/A

Russel:  Three Kings is brilliant, Flirting With Disaster is hilarious and Spanking the Monkey had.....well it had balls, so to speak.  Huckabees has balls too, but the underlying brilliance of the story is never fully realized.  I'm not really sure why.  The cast is great (Mark Wahlburg gives his best performance yet) and the premise is cool.  It's the comedy that doesn't quite flow.  It has some hilarious moments (mostly involving Wahlburg) but too many that don't work.  I did enjoy the movie, and it does make you think about thinking.

As a result of the often talky and elongated explanations to mysterious answers to life questions, the screenplay may be impenatrable by most. However, if your tastes reflect that of a screw-ball comedy attempting to be a little unusual, a little fun, and a tad more memorable than most in its genre, then sure, I'd highly recommend 'Huckabees' in a  heartbeat. David O. Russel managed to direct a film that stayed with me for a while, as I often pondered the dialogue (while mostly cracking up at the little jokes here and there that would never cease to crack me up for days on end). Not that the dialogue is anything especially profound. In a way, it's deep, and in a way it's just funny and interesting to listen to. You find yourself asking questions and attempting to find answers even when you know that at the end of the day, there just aren't any solutions. It's as if 'Huckabees' is an entire babbling train of thought from the mind of Russel slapped on-screen; something that is involving and intriguing, yet never seems to make sense. Sure, these qualities tended to irritate many an audience member, but honestly, I'm not one of those people. To me, 'I Heart Huckabees' is a delectable doughnut stuffed with a thousand flavors of jelly, one of those things you never want to stop eating. And to top everything off, the actors in 'Huckabees' form the most cohesive and highest quality ensemble of the year thus far, with a nomination-level stand-out performance by Mark Wahlberg. All in all, I just wish it had been...oh I don't know, it was so much fun.
