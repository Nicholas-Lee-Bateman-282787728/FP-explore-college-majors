After I canceled my overrated tv service I found it here on amazon for 1 penny and was like come on get real I'll buy that for 4 bucks with shipping. This is a pretty good movie and I'd recommend it to anyone.",4,"pretty, preaatty good",1404950400,"07 10, 2014",2014,332,"['was', 'fun', 'movie', 'caught', '1', 'night', 'Showtime', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'acting', 'writing', 'story', 'canceled', 'overrated', 'tv', 'service', 'found', 'here', 'amazon', '1', 'penny', 'was', 'come', 'get', 'real', ""'ll"", 'buy', '4', 'bucks', 'shipping', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'anyone']",Lucky

Lucy is hilarious - a giant strawberry with attitude and Colin Hanks is JUST like his father - sneaky but sweet looking in a Mormonesque way.  This movie is so amusing.,5,"Oh, Lucy!

It really delivers entertainment as much asThe Ref.This has the same wardrobe asBarry Mundaywhich unfortunately is not as rewatchable.It's better than that Lysine movie with Matt Damon.  It's just light and pretty like an Easter basket from Woolworth's.She's better in this thanScoop.,5,Ari Graynor is better than all the Meg Ryan Nora Ephron movies out there,1376870400,"08 19, 2013",2013,382,"['really', 'funny', 'movie', 'really', 'likable', 'permanently', 'Instant', 'Q', 'netflix', 'really', 'entertainment', 'much', 'asThe', 'Ref.This', 'same', 'wardrobe', 'asBarry', 'Mundaywhich', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'rewatchable.It', 'better', 'Lysine', 'movie', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'just', 'light', 'pretty', 'Easter', 'basket', ""Woolworth's.She"", 'better', 'thanScoop']",Lucky

I wouldn't be fooled by the friendly reviews and believe the people that wrote them are associated with the movie somehow. Have you seen how horrible For A Good Time Call is??? Ari Graynor is pretty cute but she needs to fire her agent.

1453595,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B005C9YZMS,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[3, 3]","This is one of those low key movies one does not see big marketing campaigns about.  There are some big names in it: Ann Margaret, for example.  Story is set in the small town in Iowa.  Two young people, who have known each other since childhood, work together in a small accounting firm.  They have known each other forever.  Both in some way are social misfits: he still lives in a same home with his mother; she is an orphan who likes to talk to her pet bird.Their circumstances change when he wins lottery.  Except that the lottery ticket in question is not really his...  Before long, the two are married, only to realize that each one of them has a secret that may destroy their marriage.  This is interesting black comedy with very unusual ending.  It is a story of obsessive love, bond of loyalty and sometimes unusual ways some people can attain their happines...",4,When being lucky is not what it seems,1344211200,"08 6, 2012",2012,872,"['one', 'low', 'key', 'movies', 'one', 'not', 'see', 'big', 'marketing', 'campaigns', 'are', 'big', 'names', 'Ann', 'Margaret', 'example', 'Story', 'set', 'small', 'town', 'Iowa', 'Two', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'known', 'other', 'childhood', 'work', 'together', 'small', 'accounting', 'firm', 'have', 'known', 'other', 'forever', 'way', 'are', 'social', 'misfits', 'still', 'same', 'home', 'mother', 'orphan', 'who', 'talk', 'pet', 'bird.Their', 'circumstances', 'change', 'when', 'lottery', 'lottery', 'ticket', 'question', 'not', 'really', 'long', 'two', 'are', 'married', 'only', 'realize', 'one', 'secret', 'may', 'destroy', 'marriage', 'interesting', 'black', 'comedy', 'very', 'unusual', 'ending', 'story', 'obsessive', 'love', 'bond', 'loyalty', 'sometimes', 'unusual', 'ways', 'people', 'can', 'attain', 'happines']",Lucky
1453596,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B005C9YZMS,Tony Heck,"[7, 8]","""I think you won the lottery."" Shy and Goofy Ben (Hanks) has had a crush on the receptionist Lucy (Graynor) at his office for a long time. She doesn't know he exists. When Ben comes home and finds that he has won the 36 million dollar lottery Lucy finally talks to him. When secrets come out their relationship, and morals are challenged. This is a hard movie to review. While it wasn't a bad movie and did have some funny parts, the trailer is misleading and this wasn't what I was expecting. The trailer made it look like more of a comedy then it was. Hanks does a good job playing this type of character, but the movie overall felt a little flat and boring. Like so many other movies recently it feels like there is something missing to make this better. It also felt like with this idea they could have done so much more. All that being said this movie is not terrible and if you go in expecting less of a comedy then the trailer shows you will probably enjoy this. Overall, not a bad movie, but nothing like I was expecting. Because of my expectations I didn't like it as much as I thought. I give it a B-.Would I watch again? - Most likely no.",3,"A movie that is hurt by the trailer. I expected this to be much funnier. Not a bad movie though, just not what I thought.
