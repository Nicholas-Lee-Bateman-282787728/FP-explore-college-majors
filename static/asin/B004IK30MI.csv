1410808,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B004IK30MI,Anthony L.,"[3, 3]","Wow! Patriot Games is one helluva an action movie!Harrison Fordburns with intensity playing Jack Ryan as an everyman with a deadly right hook and a staunch moral compass...that is *still* the best incarnation of Ryan onscreen. His bar threat to Richard Harris' snaky IRA representative shows an intensity and coldness that Ford rarely shows.Sean Beanis fiery and unpredictable as vengeance-bent Sean Miller, out for revenge on Jack Ryan with a submachine gun, chiselled cheekbones, and an Ulster accent. Sean Bean is *this* close to being typecast as a villain, he manages to be sympathetic AND menacing - in one of his best roles.Patrick Berginis one icy cool customer as he steals the scenes as calculating, psychotic terrorist Kevin O'Donnell. Bergin gives an electrifying performance: violent, menacing, and played with a devilishly cold glint in the eyes.I was almost ashamed to say that I was proud to be an Irishman as I watched this movie!The rest of the cast, especially Samuel L. Jackson and Richard Harris, play their roles with aplomb. Technically, the film gets top marks. The score by James Horner is up to the maestro's usual top standards. The editing is excellent and the cinematography is quite often stunning.Phillip Noyce directs with style and a relevancy that was ahead of it's time. Patriot Games is often surprisingly effective, even if some of the outdated tech is often painful to watch. The action scenes are excellent, riveting, and realistic, with the Irishmen stealing the scenes, or rather, shooting them full of holes with an M16.Jack Ryan may not be as suave and impeccable chiselled as Bond; he may not know how to kill someone with a hand towel like Jason Bourne...but he has a moral compass, a strong jaw, a stronger right hook, and a sense of decency that, when it is frayed by evil men, can turn into fiery heat in a second. Combined with Tom Clancy's techno-centric, improbable but entertaining plots, Patriot Games is an above average spy thriller.My rating? 4.5 stars out of 5.P.S. Rest in peace, Tom Clancy. You wrote books so big they could be used as house bricks in an emergency. Your plots were so complex they needed alternate universes to make sense. Your Jack Ryan is one of America's favorite characters, because he represents the truth, justice, and American way that they strive for. You named one of your books ""Red Rabbit"", which was brave, to say the least...You died too soon, so once again I say, rest in peace. I now turn to John le Carre to fill your empty hole, but I know the page count is too thick for it to be filled up...",5,Clear and Present Entertainment!

1410812,A7Y6AVS576M03,B004IK30MI,gobirds2,"[0, 0]","It is interesting how Harrison Ford replaced Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan in PATRIOT GAMES and that made PATRIOT GAMES' focus around Jack Ryan as the main character much stronger. That transaction seemed flawless and a natural one. Ford's interpretation is that of a thinking man and a man of action and one of integrity in both PATRIOT GAMES and A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER. Anne Archer as Cathy Ryan in both films also strengthens the dynamics that she and her husband have a the screen. Harrison Ford's Jack Ryan is a family man and that strengthens his image of dedication to both family and country. I like both PATRIOT GAMES and A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER very much. There are very good scenes in both films. I always liked the scene in PATRIOT GAMES where Ryan stops the IRA assassination outside of Buckingham Palace. PATRIOT GAMES filmed in some really great locations. PATRIOT GAMES is one of Phillip Noyce's best directorial efforts. I thought Joaquim de Almeida as Colonel Felix Cortez in A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER almost stole the film with his performance, He has a very strong screen presence. There were also some very tense moments in A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER. The one actor in all three films who always steels the scenes he is in was James Earl Jones as Admiral James Greer. It really is great have all three films in one. I also like James Horner,s score for both films. His scored is really tied to the human side of the narratives and not the action.",5,Harrison Ford IS Jack Ryan,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,1471,"['interesting', 'how', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'replaced', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'made', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'focus', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'main', 'character', 'much', 'stronger', 'transaction', 'seemed', 'flawless', 'natural', 'one', 'Ford', 'interpretation', 'thinking', 'man', 'man', 'action', 'one', 'integrity', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'A', 'CLEAR', 'AND', 'PRESENT', 'DANGER', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'Cathy', 'Ryan', 'films', 'also', 'dynamics', 'husband', 'have', 'screen', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'family', 'man', 'image', 'dedication', 'family', 'country', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'A', 'CLEAR', 'AND', 'PRESENT', 'DANGER', 'very', 'much', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'scenes', 'films', 'always', 'liked', 'scene', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'where', 'Ryan', 'IRA', 'assassination', 'Buckingham', 'Palace', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'filmed', 'really', 'great', 'locations', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'one', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'best', 'directorial', 'efforts', 'thought', 'Joaquim', 'de', 'Almeida', 'Colonel', 'Felix', 'Cortez', 'A', 'CLEAR', 'AND', 'PRESENT', 'DANGER', 'almost', 'stole', 'film', 'performance', 'very', 'strong', 'screen', 'presence', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'tense', 'moments', 'CLEAR', 'AND', 'PRESENT', 'DANGER', 'one', 'actor', 'three', 'films', 'who', 'always', 'steels', 'scenes', 'was', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Admiral', 'James', 'Greer', 'really', 'great', 'have', 'three', 'films', 'one', 'also', 'James', 'Horner', 's', 'score', 'films', 'scored', 'really', 'tied', 'human', 'side', 'narratives', 'not', 'action']",Clear and Present Danger/Patriot Games
