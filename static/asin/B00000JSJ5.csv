508052,A318OYMQJK0UYI,B00000JSJ5,C. Slayton,"[5, 5]","Set in preWWII Yorkshire, this is the continuation of a series that generated 87 (!) episodes and three specials, and came back after an 8 year hiatus. If you are into action sequences and special effects, this is not a series for you, but if you enjoy beautiful scenery, fine acting, and are not troubled by the pace of a different age, these are the most satisfying examples of story-telling about real people and their animals. There are no scenes of existential ponderings, but the problems faced by the veterinarians of the day were not trivial, since livelihoods could depend on proper treatment. The attitude of these characters toward their vocation, and the prevailing disquiet in Europe as the war clouds mount, are about the only serious issues treated here, and I for one, found this to be balm for a viewer otherwise inundated with the crime, quiz and situation comedy shows of the time.Though this be heresy, I enjoyed the series more than I enjoyed reading the books, which are not presented linearly in time, but as a series of disconnected episodes. There are also dozens of scenes in which the author does not appear and cannot have been a witness, so the mechanism for conveying this in the books is much less natural than in the teleplay. Having seen nearly every episode, the consistency of the cast and the presentation are a tribute to the painstaking production values, since there were numerous personnel changes behind the scenes (as well as the death of one cast member) over the long life of this production.This series was transferred from 1978 era film, so I noticed a slightly greenish hue to shadows, blacks and lighting blurs that I noticed when I saw them originally (ca 1979-80). These were broadcast on Sunday evenings on PBS in my area, and they filled the time slot where Disney and Sullivan had held sway for many years. These are perfect for family viewing UNLESS you are 1) squeamish about seeing actors with their arms up a cow's backside, or 2) bothered by alcohol consumption. A character rarely enters the drawing room without a gin, whisky or sherry being poured, and many scenes are in pubs. This seemed perfectly natural to me, but I had seen plenty of period British TV by then. These are based on memoirs and the author was on hand to correct anything wrong, so I am happy that the series was not ""Disney-fied,"" and such scenes are proof (no pun intended). I cannot comment on the accuracy of the set decoration but I assume that it is scrupulous, since this is all within living memory of many of the participants. Except for the automobiles and brief references in dialogue, the time setting for this series would be difficult to determine; costumes would not look out of place on the streets of these villages today (maybe the occasional ""plus-fours"" would raise some eyebrows today). This gives this particular 2nd series a timeless quality.  The illusion that you are in homes and villages (as opposed to studios and ""location"" shots) was perfect for this viewer, especially the natural lighting.This series does not carry the angst of the postwar episodes, but it does feature some of the most irritating clientele, as embodied by Mr Dimsdale and Miss Dooley. Mrs Pumphrey and Tricky Woo are back, and the explosive Robert Hardy is always fun to contrast against the otherwise subdued cast members. Sound quality is acceptable, but the 'Dales accent may be incomprehensible to some viewers and there are no captions, so the use of actors (and non-actors) with true Northern English accents can be a challenge for some ears. Fortunately the context is so clear that it seldom interferes with enjoyment.If you love this series as much as I did, you will want to get ""James Herriot's Yorkshire,"" a walking and driving tour with Christopher Timothy, which was produced just after Herriot's death, as well as the longer ""specials"" (three) that spun from the show.",5,Best of the Brit series,1170806400,"02 7, 2007",2007,3914,"['Set', 'preWWII', 'Yorkshire', 'continuation', 'series', 'generated', '87', 'episodes', 'three', 'specials', 'came', 'back', '8', 'year', 'hiatus', 'are', 'action', 'sequences', 'special', 'effects', 'not', 'series', 'enjoy', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'fine', 'acting', 'are', 'not', 'troubled', 'pace', 'different', 'age', 'are', 'most', 'satisfying', 'examples', 'story-telling', 'real', 'people', 'animals', 'are', 'scenes', 'existential', 'ponderings', 'problems', 'faced', 'veterinarians', 'day', 'were', 'not', 'trivial', 'livelihoods', 'could', 'depend', 'proper', 'treatment', 'attitude', 'characters', 'vocation', 'prevailing', 'disquiet', 'Europe', 'war', 'clouds', 'mount', 'are', 'only', 'serious', 'issues', 'treated', 'here', 'one', 'found', 'be', 'balm', 'viewer', 'otherwise', 'inundated', 'crime', 'quiz', 'situation', 'comedy', 'shows', 'time.Though', 'be', 'heresy', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'more', 'enjoyed', 'reading', 'books', 'are', 'not', 'presented', 'linearly', 'time', 'series', 'disconnected', 'episodes', 'are', 'also', 'dozens', 'scenes', 'author', 'not', 'appear', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'witness', 'mechanism', 'conveying', 'books', 'much', 'less', 'natural', 'teleplay', 'Having', 'seen', 'nearly', 'episode', 'consistency', 'cast', 'presentation', 'are', 'tribute', 'painstaking', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'numerous', 'personnel', 'changes', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'death', 'one', 'cast', 'member', 'long', 'life', 'production.This', 'series', 'was', 'transferred', '1978', 'era', 'film', 'noticed', 'slightly', 'greenish', 'hue', 'shadows', 'blacks', 'lighting', 'blurs', 'noticed', 'when', 'saw', 'originally', 'ca', '1979-80', 'were', 'broadcast', 'Sunday', 'evenings', 'PBS', 'area', 'filled', 'time', 'slot', 'where', 'Disney', 'Sullivan', 'had', 'held', 'sway', 'many', 'years', 'are', 'perfect', 'family', 'viewing', 'are', '1', 'squeamish', 'seeing', 'actors', 'arms', 'up', 'cow', 'backside', '2', 'bothered', 'alcohol', 'consumption', 'character', 'rarely', 'drawing', 'room', 'gin', 'whisky', 'sherry', 'being', 'poured', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'pubs', 'seemed', 'perfectly', 'natural', 'had', 'seen', 'plenty', 'period', 'British', 'TV', 'then', 'are', 'based', 'memoirs', 'author', 'was', 'hand', 'correct', 'anything', 'wrong', 'am', 'happy', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'Disney-fied', 'such', 'scenes', 'are', 'proof', 'pun', 'intended', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'accuracy', 'set', 'decoration', 'assume', 'scrupulous', 'living', 'memory', 'many', 'participants', 'automobiles', 'brief', 'references', 'dialogue', 'time', 'setting', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'determine', 'costumes', 'would', 'not', 'look', 'place', 'streets', 'villages', 'today', 'maybe', 'occasional', 'plus-fours', 'would', 'raise', 'eyebrows', 'today', 'particular', '2nd', 'series', 'timeless', 'quality', 'illusion', 'are', 'homes', 'villages', 'opposed', 'studios', 'location', 'shots', 'was', 'perfect', 'viewer', 'especially', 'natural', 'lighting.This', 'series', 'not', 'carry', 'angst', 'postwar', 'episodes', 'feature', 'most', 'irritating', 'clientele', 'embodied', 'Mr', 'Dimsdale', 'Miss', 'Dooley', 'Mrs', 'Pumphrey', 'Tricky', 'Woo', 'are', 'back', 'explosive', 'Robert', 'Hardy', 'always', 'fun', 'contrast', 'otherwise', 'subdued', 'cast', 'members', 'Sound', 'quality', 'acceptable', ""'Dales"", 'accent', 'may', 'be', 'incomprehensible', 'viewers', 'are', 'captions', 'use', 'actors', 'non-actors', 'true', 'Northern', 'English', 'accents', 'can', 'be', 'challenge', 'ears', 'Fortunately', 'context', 'so', 'clear', 'interferes', 'enjoyment.If', 'love', 'series', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'will', 'want', 'get', 'James', 'Herriot', 'Yorkshire', 'walking', 'driving', 'tour', 'Christopher', 'Timothy', 'was', 'produced', 'just', 'Herriot', 'death', 'as', 'well', 'longer', 'specials', 'three', 'spun', 'show']","All Creatures Great and Small, Series 2: Volumes 1-6 VHS"

At the time, I predicted that the book would be a smash hit.  It surpassed any expectations my imagination could have conjured up.  Later, the British TV series picked up the ball and ran with it.Whenever I'm down-in-the-dumps, I pick up the Series 2 collection and put on the Christmas at Skeldale House episode, which comprises all that is so heartwarming about the series, including the finding and bringing home of the Christmas tree, the healing of a little girl's beloved pony, and the gift of the mistletoe. If I were marooned on a desert island, this is one of the collections I would want with me.  One never tires of the evocative opening musical theme, nor of traveling to England's pre-WW II Yorkshire Dales to once more be in the presence of the irascible Siegfried, the dedicated James and his patient wife, the hormonal Tristan, and the Darrowby regulars, including Tricky Woo and Mrs. Pumphrey.The series belongs in a space capsule so a thousand years from now, if civilization has survived, viewers can discover some of the best of times that existed before some of the worst of times.Having grown up on a farm, I well recall the veterinarian's visits, so I should add a warning -- Be prepared: Impressionable young children may ask a lot of questions, such as, ""Why does that man have his hand inside the cow?"" or, in the birthing scenes,  ""How did that baby lamb get inside the mother?""  There is a scene of a horse being gelded, and also a few scenes of animals being euthanized.  They are low-key and not sensationalized, but could easily disturb a sensitive child, so parents may want to pre-view the series and decide whether they find such scenes suitable for child viewers, especially those prone to nightmares.

The blessing of technology today has allowed me to &quot;catch up&quot; on this classic courtesy of the DVD's. I really found this &quot;world&quot; relaxing and mildly fun. It is the type of world I remember of sitting in front of a fire, smoking a pipe and perhaps some liquid refreshment at hand talking with friends for hours on end. That is what this show emulates among many visitations to professional veternary emergencies. The characters are lovable, memorable, and reflect a part of the &quot;polite world&quot; which unfortunately today no longer exists. The unhurried atmosphere and the natural beauty of the Yorkshire countryside combine with the lives of rich and poor and animals on the dales. I suggest you read the account by James Herriot first. There is a very good Reader's Digest edition with great illustrations that efficiently condenses and contains the best parts of Herriots original series of &quot;All Creatures Great and Small' books. This will aid you when you see the series because there are a lot of &quot;old world&quot; things that the book will aquaint you with (complete with illustrations that explain what the 'gadget&quot; was used for) and you will see in the show. So you will appreciate the effort of the producers of this series all the more. Robert Hardy is memorable there are also spot characters that make it a very entertaining and wonderful production.

This DVD box set is from the second season, which played in September through December 1978. Some photography scenes were taken direct off Yorkshire farms. There are very little special effects, the only ones I can think of is either drugged or fake animals to act out certain quick scenes. Were some of the animals trained to act like they were sick or dying? For example: This set shows a horse dying of lockjaw with the finishing effect of lying on the ground shaking. Sometimes certain operations were preformed with a human hand, checking the rear of certain animals for pregnancies or intestinal problems. At times when the actors themselves are seen performing inspections on the animals, their hands were either hidden behind the animals or the actors makes facial expressions with the lower parts of their bodies off the screen. Very down to Earth & as real as possible with great effect.The Actors: Christopher Timothy plays James Herriot, a Scottish newly qualified Veterinarian as co-owner with Veterinarian Surgeon Siegfried Farnon, played by Robert Hardy, in the Yorkshire farming community of Darrowby during the 1930's. Veterinary student & Siegfried's younger brother Tristan, played by Peter Davison continues to miss things up, for example: blowing up a cow in one show. The housekeeper is Mrs. Hall, played by Mary Hignett. James wife & secretary for the entire business is Helen played by Carol Drinkwater.Commentary: The second season is more even in plot & characters than the first season. Most shows deal with the brothers Siegfried & Tristan tricking James into volunteering for something they don't what to do. The whole Veterinary household will become a part of your family with their joys, sorrows, & adventures. As with the first season this box set comes with 4 DVD's: at three to four 50 to 55 minute programs per DVD.There are two other DVD box sets, the first & third seasons, & a single DVD of 2 specials short in the mid 1980's.

Expected it to be dated but was very happy with quality.,5,Hours of fun,1392768000,"02 19, 2014",2014,164,"['classic', 'BBC', 'production', 'books', 'very', 'closely', 'Outstanding', 'acting', 'future', 'stars', 'Expected', 'be', 'dated', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'quality']","All Creatures Great and Small, Series 2: Volumes 1-6 VHS"
508081,A257K789L7H1EY,B00000JSJ5,Wendy,"[0, 0]",Loved the first series so much I had to get the second.  This series continues the genuinely charming if slightly romanticized view of a Yorkshire County Veterinary surgeon in pre WWII England.  Fabulous characters and glorious countryside.  More comedic and light-weight than Downton Abbey but still with all that Old World charm.  Highly recommend the James Herriot books too.,5,All creatures great and small series 2,1340064000,"06 19, 2012",2012,378,"['Loved', 'first', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'get', 'second', 'series', 'genuinely', 'charming', 'slightly', 'romanticized', 'view', 'Yorkshire', 'County', 'Veterinary', 'surgeon', 'pre', 'WWII', 'England', 'Fabulous', 'characters', 'glorious', 'countryside', 'More', 'comedic', 'light-weight', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'still', 'Old', 'World', 'charm', 'Highly', 'recommend', 'James', 'Herriot', 'books', 'too']","All Creatures Great and Small, Series 2: Volumes 1-6 VHS"
