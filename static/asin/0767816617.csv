12791,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,0767816617,Alex Udvary,"[8, 9]","Bashed by critics, audience viewers have given this movie cult status, and deservedly so. Good fun performances by everyone but of course the standout is Jennifer Love Hewitt who plays the most popular girl at school Amanda Becket. The story goes something like this. Since it's their last day of school Preston Meyers (Ethan Embry) sees this as his last chance to tell the girl of his dreams (Becket) just how much he loves her. While his best friend Denise Fleming (Lauren Ambrose) has doubts about it. Telling him, what if she doesn't like you? Ever since Amanda's (Hewitt) break up with popular jock Mike Dexter (Peter Facinelli) Becket is the most sought at girl at the party. Now each person has their own agenda at this party. For instance Embry (Preston) wants to tell Hewitt he loves her, and William Lichter (Charlie Korsmo) has his own agenda. William has been humiliated his entire life by Dexter (Facinelli). And feels tonight at the party is his perfect way of getting back at him for all the years of misery Dexter put him through. But that's not the only thing going on at this party. Everyone wants to get &quot;lucky&quot;. And no one does more than Kenny Fisher (Seth Green), who in my opinion is the funniest character in the movie! With so much going on you can tell this will turn out to be a funny fast paced teen comedy that I'm sure all teens and even adults will enjoy. Teens might think Seth Green gives the best performance, he certainly is the funniest, and might just want to watch the movie for him. But I think Hewitt is the highlight of the movie. Some might like to take notice to the brief cameos seen in the movie by Melissa Joan Hart, Jerry O' Connell, and a voice over by Liv Tyler. Here's a good clean, and funny teen comedy all will enjoy.",3,Good Jennifer Love Hewitt Vehicle,970444800,"10 2, 2000",2000,1779,"['Bashed', 'critics', 'audience', 'viewers', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'cult', 'status', 'deservedly', 'so', 'Good', 'fun', 'performances', 'everyone', 'course', 'standout', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'who', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', 'Amanda', 'Becket', 'story', 'something', 'last', 'day', 'school', 'Preston', 'Meyers', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'last', 'chance', 'tell', 'girl', 'dreams', 'Becket', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'best', 'friend', 'Denise', 'Fleming', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'doubts', 'Telling', 'what', ""n't"", 'like', 'Ever', 'Amanda', 'Hewitt', 'break', 'up', 'popular', 'jock', 'Mike', 'Dexter', 'Peter', 'Facinelli', 'Becket', 'most', 'sought', 'girl', 'party', 'Now', 'person', 'own', 'agenda', 'party', 'instance', 'Embry', 'Preston', 'tell', 'Hewitt', 'William', 'Lichter', 'Charlie', 'Korsmo', 'own', 'agenda', 'William', 'been', 'humiliated', 'entire', 'life', 'Dexter', 'Facinelli', 'feels', 'tonight', 'party', 'perfect', 'way', 'getting', 'back', 'years', 'misery', 'Dexter', 'put', 'not', 'only', 'thing', 'going', 'party', 'Everyone', 'get', 'quot', 'lucky', 'quot', 'one', 'more', 'Kenny', 'Fisher', 'Seth', 'Green', 'who', 'opinion', 'funniest', 'character', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'can', 'tell', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'funny', 'fast', 'paced', 'teen', 'comedy', ""'m"", 'sure', 'teens', 'even', 'adults', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Teens', 'might', 'think', 'Seth', 'Green', 'best', 'performance', 'certainly', 'funniest', 'might', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'think', 'Hewitt', 'highlight', 'movie', 'might', 'like', 'take', 'notice', 'brief', 'cameos', 'seen', 'movie', 'Melissa', 'Joan', 'Hart', 'Jerry', 'O', 'Connell', 'voice', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'Here', 'good', 'clean', 'funny', 'teen', 'comedy', 'will', 'enjoy']",N/A
12792,A928WN8NV03WZ,0767816617,"A. M Robertson ""brother_entropy""","[4, 5]","This is one of the few feel good movies that I would give this high a rating.  It isnt anything new, the characters don't break any new ground, but that isn't important.  It is like listening to Beethoven, no new ground is broken, but how well are they playing it?The cast is perfect, they not only were all decent actors and fit the roles, but they don't look like actors.  They are people that you can see yourself going to high school with, not my white trash high school;), but from the average high school. Seth Green is in perfect form as the white boy who wishes he was black, posing and growling more than acting with others around him groaning.  Ethan Embry plays a believable book worm, flawed and nerdish, but believably so.  Jennifer Love Hewitt is the clas princess, and looks the part.  She is pretty, but has the look of the girl next door not a model in teenager clothing.  Rounding off the cast is the refreashing Lauren Ambrose playing the bitter intellectual.  She was rated as the new Jeannine Garafalo, unfortunate she didn't do much after this as she was a better actress than Jeannine.  As well as the underrated Charlie Korsmo, playing the uber nerd of the class.  Interestingly this was his last performance before joining the department of energy.As previously stated, they don't really break any new ground.  The white boy wishing he was a black guy has a moment of self realization.  The bitter intellectual realizes that she might be at fault for her lonliness and hooks up with a very unlikely person.  The quiet book worm gets courage to ask out someone who was beyond his level.  The jock has a sobering moment when he sees where is life is headed.  etc........No new ground broken, but it is treated more seriously than most movies of its genre.  The pacing is well done and keeps you interested throughout the movie.  The humor is offbeat at times and has a freash feel to it.  Though the characters are cliche, they make you interested in them and their plights.  I found myself wanting the bookworm to give his letter to the girl, for the princess to discover who she is alone, etc..  Plus they used their soundtrack well, good songs and they fit the scenes that they were in.All in all it was a good movie, not great, but good.  It is also one of the few feel good movies that I would advise to others.  It is a movie that is idealistic and has a happy ending but doesn't become sappy or preechy like others of its genre.  It also manages to be one of the best high school party movies ever.",4,One of the best high school party movies ever,1085011200,"05 20, 2004",2004,2528,"['one', 'few', 'feel', 'good', 'movies', 'would', 'give', 'high', 'rating', 'anything', 'new', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'break', 'new', 'ground', ""n't"", 'important', 'listening', 'Beethoven', 'new', 'ground', 'broken', 'how', 'well', 'are', 'playing', 'cast', 'perfect', 'not', 'only', 'were', 'decent', 'actors', 'fit', 'roles', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'actors', 'are', 'people', 'can', 'see', 'going', 'high', 'school', 'not', 'white', 'trash', 'high', 'school', 'average', 'high', 'school', 'Seth', 'Green', 'perfect', 'form', 'white', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'black', 'posing', 'growling', 'more', 'acting', 'others', 'groaning', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'believable', 'book', 'worm', 'flawed', 'nerdish', 'believably', 'so', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'clas', 'princess', 'part', 'pretty', 'look', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'not', 'model', 'teenager', 'clothing', 'Rounding', 'off', 'cast', 'refreashing', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'playing', 'bitter', 'intellectual', 'was', 'rated', 'new', 'Jeannine', 'Garafalo', 'unfortunate', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'was', 'better', 'actress', 'Jeannine', 'As', 'well', 'underrated', 'Charlie', 'Korsmo', 'playing', 'uber', 'nerd', 'class', 'Interestingly', 'was', 'last', 'performance', 'joining', 'department', 'energy.As', 'previously', 'stated', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'white', 'boy', 'wishing', 'was', 'black', 'guy', 'moment', 'self', 'realization', 'bitter', 'intellectual', 'realizes', 'might', 'be', 'fault', 'lonliness', 'up', 'very', 'unlikely', 'person', 'quiet', 'book', 'worm', 'courage', 'ask', 'out', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'level', 'jock', 'sobering', 'moment', 'when', 'where', 'life', 'headed', 'etc', '..No', 'new', 'ground', 'broken', 'treated', 'more', 'seriously', 'most', 'movies', 'genre', 'pacing', 'well', 'done', 'interested', 'movie', 'humor', 'offbeat', 'times', 'freash', 'feel', 'characters', 'are', 'cliche', 'make', 'interested', 'plights', 'found', 'wanting', 'bookworm', 'give', 'letter', 'girl', 'princess', 'discover', 'who', 'alone', 'etc..', 'used', 'soundtrack', 'well', 'good', 'songs', 'fit', 'scenes', 'were', 'in.All', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'good', 'also', 'one', 'few', 'feel', 'good', 'movies', 'would', 'advise', 'others', 'movie', 'idealistic', 'happy', 'ending', ""n't"", 'become', 'sappy', 'preechy', 'others', 'genre', 'also', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'high', 'school', 'party', 'movies', 'ever']",N/A

Seth Green reminds me of so many people in my high school.  Pretty sad, really.  Jerry O'Connell is hilarious in his short seen as Trip McNealy, the sexual icon at Huntington.

12795,A2Q5PDCSQ1JSF1,0767816617,Benjamin Scott,"[0, 1]","I took my little brother to see this when it first came out. I surprised  myself by thoroughly enjoying it. It was the perfect teenage ensemble  piece. Though it was by no means deep, the movie was hilarious and well  constructed.Mainly the actors are very good. Seth Green was, as usual,  great in this role as the scene stealing wannabe. Ethan Embry was excellent  as the sensitive and popular loser. Lauren Ambrose was very much refreshing  in the sarcastic role of the misfit. Charlie Korsmo pulled off the nerd  prefectly. Jennifer Love Hewitt, however, did almost nothing but stare at  the other actors with a sort of confused irritated look throughout the  movie. Peter Facinelli pulled off the no-brainer jock role without a hitch.  And the rest of the actors, tiny parts or not, did very well.Though the  movie itself is great, the DVD's addition of the audio commentary by Harry  Elfont, Deborah Kaplan (co-writers and -directors), the producer, and Seth  Green was an incredible plus. Though lacking in other features, this more  than makes up for it. Listening to all the bits and pieces cut for the  PG-13 rating is so much fun and adds a hilarious kind of counter plot in  which you try to guess how the deleted scenes would have gone.In short,  this story of a graduation night party and how leaving high school will  affect the variety of characters is a perfect companion to a night of fun  with your friends. It is easy to watch again and again, picking little  details not noticed before or just enjoying yourself as the movie unfolds.

12797,A2PBV1899CX3TE,0767816617,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 2]","The writing and directing team of Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan (Josie and the Pussycats) met at film school and discovered that their respective parents were friends and they had both gone to High School at the same time in Philadelphia, just a few miles apart from each other. When Harry met Deborah would make a great movie, but maybe it already has, it was just called ""Can't Hardly Wait."" If they had just gone to the same High School, instead of two nearby ones, they could have been Amanda Beckett and Preston Meyers (I'm betting this is from Harry's perspective) or Kenny Fisher and Denise Fleming (Deborah's, anyone?).Preston Meyers (Ethan Embry) fell in love with Amanda Beckett (Jennifer Love Hewitt) the first moment he saw her. It was fate that threw them together, because they were both eating strawberry Pop-Tarts. Who can deny that the strawberry Pop-Tarts were an omen?----------------Preston: [narrating] It was October, freshman year. First time in history that I'd ever missed the bus. If I had arrived on time, I never would've seen her. But as it was, I was the first person at Huntington Hills High to set eyes on Amanda Beckett. It was her first day at school. Then, I'm sitting in class enjoying a late breakfast when out of all the classrooms in the entire school, she walks into mine. And where does the teacher sit her? Right next to me! Now, up until now, one could write this off to coincidence. But then she reaches in her bag and pulls out a strawberry Pop-Tart - the very same breakfast pastry I was consuming at that moment! What was I to do? How was I to proceed?======================================How was he to proceed, indeed? Preston's head was in the clouds; but by the time he cleared his thoughts Amanda had already been snatched up by Mike (Peter Facinelli), a shallow and conceited jock. Nevertheless, Preston believes in the portentous strawberry Pop-Tarts, and pours his feelings into a letter to Amanda that he constantly revises. As further evidence that he and Amanda are meant to be together he hears ""Mandy"" by Barry Manilow on the radio just as he is going to the graduation party. A party where Amanda will be in attendance, having just broken up with Mike. Mandy, short for Amanda -- could anything be more fortuitous?Preston asks his friend, Denise Fleming, what she thinks of the signs, fate, and the latest revision of his letter to Amanda. Denise is skeptical. She is the clever red headed outsider, rolling her eyes at the High School hijinks, while secretly wishing that she could be popular. Maybe she'd like to be more than friends with Preston, too, but all he thinks about is Amanda, 24/7. ""What am I, chopped liver?"" Denise probably asks herself.Meanwhile, Kenny Fisher thinks he is tres cool, but while he emulates the speech and fashion of Afro Americans, on him it just looks comical. It didn't work for Joseph Gordon-Levitt in ""Havoc,"" either.---------------------Denise: There's a mirror right there. Take a look, you're white.==========================So now you get the gist of ""Can't Hardly Wait."" It is about a big party right after High School graduation, where Freaks, Geeks, Jocks, and Frocks all frolic, some with hidden agendas, and some with agendas not hidden at all, completely and totally blatant. If you were persecuted in High School, perhaps you can relate. The script very much favors the clever misfits, and forecasts the day when the smart will finally prevail. Hard to believe that will ever happen to geeks like this, but it makes for a nice wishful fantasy.-------------------X-Phile 1: You know what? My retainer looks like a Klingon warship.==========================""Can't Hardly Wait"" is very well written, and juggles the multiple story balls well. The direction was none too shabby, either. With Harry and Deborah, you get two points of view for the price of one. There are many Rashomon moments. Raging High School kegger that careens out of control? Tres cliche. But ""Can't Hardly Wait"" rises above the triteness of the material. There are tons of actors and actresses here who will go on to greater fame, and others who are headed for oblivion -- or television. It is fun just to watch the falling or shooting stars.Jennifer Love Hewitt is really cute. Wow. She's acutely cute. Excrutiatingly cute also were Nicole Bilderback and Tamala Jones. Lauren Ambrose gave a very nuanced performance as Denise Fleming. Seth Green took many chances as Kenny Fisher, but I'm not sure that the chances he took paid off.

12799,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0767816617,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[12, 14]","In my opinion, this is one of the best teen movies ever made.  While the main characters seem somewhat stereotypical at first, all of the characters (well, almost all of them) break down the barriers of high school cliquedom and discover something about themselves and their high school classmates.  The whole movie centers around a party on graduation night.  Preston (Ethan Embry) has carried a torch for Amanda (the gorgeous Jennifer Love Hewitt) ever since meeting her as a freshman.  After four years, Amanda has just been dumped by her jock boyfriend, and Preston is convinced that fate will finally bring him and Amanda together.  A series of ""signs"" convinces him to tell Amanda how he feels about her--this task becomes pretty complicated as the night progresses.  Meanwhile, there are other wonderful subplots.  Seth Green is hilarious as a jive-talking, would-be playboy determined to find a girl at the party; he ends up stuck in a bathroom with a girl he was good friends with before he tried to join the cool crowd in high school.  The obligatory nerd goes to the party with a plan to humiliate Amanda's ex-boyfriend for having picked on him for years, and he ends up becoming the life of the party.  His drunken performance of GNR's ""Paradise City"" is not to be missed.  A lot of things happen throughout the movie, but the only person who really comes out a loser is Amanda's ex-boyfriend.As a former nerd, I enjoyed seeing the self-absorbed jock get humiliated, the nerd become temporarily popular, and the shy guy stand a chance of getting the girl.  I'm sure some people think the idea of carrying around a letter to a girl for four years is weird or obsessive, but I can attest to the fact that carrying around a secret longing for a person runs deep within the soul and cannot be expected to disappear in such a short time as four years.  One feature of this movie I really liked was seeing a yearbook-like biography of each character at the beginning--complete with high school activities, future plans, and a favorite quote.The entire cast is terrific, and I really enjoy this movie every time I watch it.  Seth Green, as I have mentioned, is downright hilarious.  Hewitt does a wonderful job portraying a prom queen who wants to find someone who will see her for what kind of person she is rather than judge her solely on her looks.  Although the movie may sound like typical teenaged silliness to some, the characters do succeed in disproving the often perceived shallowness of the young.  If you believe or want to believe in fate, this movie can also be an uplifting experience.  As an added bonus, Smash Mouth's video for ""Can't Get Enough of You Baby"" featuring a dangerously stunning Jennifer Love Hewitt is also included with the movie.",5,My favorite teen movie of the 90s,1023840000,"06 12, 2002",2002,2767,"['opinion', 'one', 'best', 'teen', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'main', 'characters', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'stereotypical', 'first', 'characters', 'well', 'almost', 'break', 'down', 'barriers', 'high', 'school', 'cliquedom', 'discover', 'something', 'high', 'school', 'classmates', 'whole', 'movie', 'centers', 'party', 'graduation', 'night', 'Preston', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'carried', 'torch', 'Amanda', 'gorgeous', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'ever', 'meeting', 'freshman', 'four', 'years', 'Amanda', 'just', 'been', 'dumped', 'jock', 'boyfriend', 'Preston', 'convinced', 'fate', 'will', 'finally', 'bring', 'Amanda', 'together', 'A', 'series', 'signs', 'tell', 'Amanda', 'how', 'task', 'pretty', 'complicated', 'night', 'Meanwhile', 'are', 'other', 'wonderful', 'subplots', 'Seth', 'Green', 'hilarious', 'jive-talking', 'would-be', 'playboy', 'determined', 'find', 'girl', 'party', 'up', 'stuck', 'bathroom', 'girl', 'was', 'good', 'friends', 'tried', 'join', 'cool', 'crowd', 'high', 'school', 'obligatory', 'nerd', 'party', 'plan', 'humiliate', 'Amanda', 'ex-boyfriend', 'having', 'picked', 'years', 'up', 'becoming', 'life', 'party', 'drunken', 'performance', 'GNR', 'Paradise', 'City', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'lot', 'things', 'happen', 'movie', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'really', 'out', 'loser', 'Amanda', 'ex-boyfriend.As', 'former', 'nerd', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'self-absorbed', 'jock', 'get', 'humiliated', 'nerd', 'become', 'temporarily', 'popular', 'shy', 'guy', 'stand', 'chance', 'getting', 'girl', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'think', 'idea', 'carrying', 'letter', 'girl', 'four', 'years', 'weird', 'obsessive', 'can', 'attest', 'fact', 'carrying', 'around', 'secret', 'longing', 'person', 'deep', 'soul', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'expected', 'disappear', 'such', 'short', 'time', 'four', 'years', 'One', 'feature', 'movie', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'seeing', 'yearbook-like', 'biography', 'character', 'beginning', 'complete', 'high', 'school', 'activities', 'future', 'plans', 'favorite', 'quote.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'terrific', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'time', 'watch', 'Seth', 'Green', 'have', 'mentioned', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'Hewitt', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portraying', 'prom', 'queen', 'who', 'find', 'someone', 'who', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'rather', 'judge', 'solely', 'looks', 'movie', 'may', 'sound', 'typical', 'teenaged', 'silliness', 'characters', 'do', 'succeed', 'disproving', 'often', 'perceived', 'shallowness', 'young', 'believe', 'want', 'believe', 'fate', 'movie', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'uplifting', 'experience', 'added', 'bonus', 'Smash', 'Mouth', 'video', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Get', 'Enough', 'Baby', 'featuring', 'dangerously', 'stunning', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'also', 'included', 'movie']",N/A
12800,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,0767816617,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[3, 6]","Some have dismissed this movie as one that delivers teen appeal, but little for anyone else. This is an assessment I disagree with. I first saw this movie when I was 27 and now in my 30s I still enjoy it. Sure, it may be a ""guilty pleasure"" but it's an entertaining one that delivers a delightful concoction  of comedy, drama and romance combined with a good  score.  In fact this movie manages to deliver some timeless themes, all packaged into 100 minutes of teen excess.It's not hard to understand why someone would have a crush on Jennifer Love Hewitt, even before she started being a regular on the phenomenally popular television show PARTY OF FIVE she had legions of fans. By time this coming-of-age movie was released in 1998, she not only had tremendous face recognition from the small screen, but also on the big screen, having just starred as the lead in the teen shocker I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER.Of course there's also the fact that she was one of the most attractive of all the teen actresses at that time.So, perhaps she was the perfect actress to play the part of the one girl in school that every man wants to be with, and the particular attention of a schoolboy crush in CAN'T HARDLY WAIT. Although she does not share as much screen time as lead Ethan Embry, her presence is felt nearly every scene in the movie.So, what's the movie about? It's the end of school and there's a party in town to celebrate - and everyone's going to be there. Destined to leave for a workshop with his idol Kurt Vonnegut the next day, Preston Meyers (Embry) sees this as the last chance to let his dream girl Amanda Beckett (Hewitt) know how he feels. Rumors abound around the school that her jock boyfriend has broken up with her and he sees this as a chance to finally deliver a love letter he has been working on since he first saw her years earlier.But fate works in mysterious ways.A young Seth Green (he had  yet to achieve fame on BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER) sees this party as an opportunity for quite another reason - namely to get laid and he and he has a whole bag of stuff with him to ensure that everything goes smoothly - which of course it doesn't.Geek William Lichter (Charlie Korsmo) sees the party as an opportunity to wreak revenge on a class bully that has been torturing him for years and in fact it is Korsmo's character and Green's character that offer most of the comedic interludes. While Embry is waxing poetic about his four year obsession with Hewitt, Green is getting locked in a bathroom with a girl and Korsmo is learning a new side to the bully.Yes, there are several subplots going on in this movie, but the humor is infectious and the characters are both well rounded and engaging. A word of warning though, for some reason I found myself listening to the commentary before watching the ending of the movie, and in fact the ending is spoiled early on in the commentary.Which brings us neatly on to the scene specific commentary. It's light and fun and delivers a number of interesting anecdotes.An easy recommendation for anyone's DVD collection.",5,Teen movie that appeals to more than just teens - a favorite of mine,1145923200,"04 25, 2006",2006,3082,"['have', 'dismissed', 'movie', 'one', 'teen', 'appeal', 'little', 'anyone', 'else', 'assessment', 'disagree', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'when', 'was', '27', 'now', '30s', 'still', 'enjoy', 'Sure', 'may', 'be', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'entertaining', 'one', 'delightful', 'concoction', 'comedy', 'drama', 'romance', 'combined', 'good', 'score', 'fact', 'movie', 'deliver', 'timeless', 'themes', 'packaged', '100', 'minutes', 'teen', 'excess.It', 'not', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'someone', 'would', 'have', 'crush', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'even', 'started', 'being', 'regular', 'phenomenally', 'popular', 'television', 'show', 'PARTY', 'OF', 'FIVE', 'had', 'legions', 'fans', 'time', 'coming-of-age', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '1998', 'not', 'only', 'had', 'tremendous', 'face', 'recognition', 'small', 'screen', 'also', 'big', 'screen', 'having', 'just', 'starred', 'lead', 'teen', 'shocker', 'KNOW', 'WHAT', 'YOU', 'DID', 'LAST', 'SUMMER.Of', 'course', 'also', 'fact', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'attractive', 'teen', 'actresses', 'time.So', 'perhaps', 'was', 'perfect', 'actress', 'play', 'part', 'one', 'girl', 'school', 'man', 'be', 'particular', 'attention', 'schoolboy', 'crush', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'HARDLY', 'WAIT', 'not', 'share', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'lead', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'presence', 'felt', 'nearly', 'scene', 'movie.So', 'what', 'movie', 'end', 'school', 'party', 'town', 'celebrate', 'everyone', 'going', 'be', 'there', 'Destined', 'leave', 'workshop', 'idol', 'Kurt', 'Vonnegut', 'next', 'day', 'Preston', 'Meyers', 'Embry', 'last', 'chance', 'let', 'dream', 'girl', 'Amanda', 'Beckett', 'Hewitt', 'know', 'how', 'Rumors', 'abound', 'school', 'jock', 'boyfriend', 'broken', 'up', 'chance', 'finally', 'deliver', 'love', 'letter', 'been', 'working', 'first', 'saw', 'years', 'earlier.But', 'fate', 'works', 'mysterious', 'ways.A', 'young', 'Seth', 'Green', 'had', 'yet', 'achieve', 'fame', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'party', 'opportunity', 'quite', 'reason', 'namely', 'get', 'laid', 'whole', 'bag', 'stuff', 'ensure', 'everything', 'smoothly', 'course', 'William', 'Lichter', 'Charlie', 'Korsmo', 'party', 'opportunity', 'wreak', 'revenge', 'class', 'bully', 'been', 'torturing', 'years', 'fact', 'Korsmo', 'character', 'Green', 'character', 'offer', 'most', 'comedic', 'interludes', 'Embry', 'waxing', 'poetic', 'four', 'year', 'obsession', 'Hewitt', 'Green', 'getting', 'locked', 'bathroom', 'girl', 'Korsmo', 'learning', 'new', 'side', 'bully.Yes', 'are', 'several', 'subplots', 'going', 'movie', 'humor', 'infectious', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'rounded', 'engaging', 'word', 'warning', 'reason', 'found', 'listening', 'commentary', 'watching', 'ending', 'movie', 'fact', 'ending', 'spoiled', 'early', 'commentary.Which', 'neatly', 'scene', 'specific', 'commentary', 'light', 'fun', 'number', 'interesting', 'anecdotes.An', 'easy', 'recommendation', 'anyone', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A

12805,A2T6I46OZKD0PF,0767816617,EBMOD,"[0, 0]","I need to vent. Okay, here goes: it's a real shame that film critics can't sit back and appreciate a movie for what it is. In this case, a harmless little graduation movie.What I loved about this film was that it features all the typical characters that you would find in high school; the most popular guy, who really isn't all that. The most popular girl, given said status based on looks rather than personality and always judged on her looks. Her group of &quot;friends&quot; [one of whom scarily resembles - in terms of personality - someone I go to school with]. The sensitive guy, the cynical girl, the guy in a desperate bid for the title of &quot;cool&quot; and the nerd, who really isn't so nerdy if you give him a chance.So yeah, I love the movie. Now it's time for the special features to be reviewed:* Commentary by directors Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan and the cast - the &quot;cast&quot; happens to be Seth Green, who for a fair bit of the commentary is speaking in a Brithish accent. I really enjoyed this commentary, and have listened to it a few times. You get a real sense that they enjoyed making this film. You also get a sense of annoyance from realising just how much of their work was cut. Worth listening to [more than once].* Theatrical trailer(s) - the best part about the trailers is the fact that 90-99% of the footage wasn't in the actual film. Consider it a cut scenes real.* Music video &quot;Can't Get Enough of You Baby&quot; by Smash Mouth - ah, yes. The soundtrack band [they've been on at least 5 by our last count].

Everyone shows up but nothing turns out as expected. The geek winds up with the girl of his dreams. The nerd becomes stud for a night and the most popular guy in school while extracting long deserved vengeance from the jock who tormented him for four years. The jock reaps the bitter harvest of what he has sown and winds up as a loser. The least popular girl in school finds love. All the wrongs are righted. It is a fantasy of the first order in this respect.This film is good for a few laughs. It is nothing to get all excited about except for those of us who did suffer through high school.

There are also  plenty of notable cameos.  Jenna Elfman (Dharma and Greg) has a funny bit  as a stripper/angel, the always welcome Seth Green is pretty fly for a  white guy, and Charlie Korsmo gets laughs as a geek who enters the social  stratosphere by lip-syncing &quot;Paradise City.&quot;All in all a  funny, feel-good movie.  But the commentary on the DVD left me hungry for  more.  The directors had to cut several scenes, and re-edit others, to  insure a PG-13 rating from the MPAA.  The scenes that they talk about sound  hilarious.  They also describe how several awkwardly cut scenes should have  played.  The scenes sound brilliant.  So, why not put a director's cut on  the disc?  How hard would it be?  I'd like to actually see the movie the  director wanted to make, not just hear about it.

This party could mean yet more ignoring her or her luck could change!

12822,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0767816617,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 7]","""Can't Hardly Wait"" is the ""American Graffiti"" for this generation of actors and actresses. Not because it is a classic coming of age film that will be remembered fondly for years and years but because you will recognize a dozen of familiar faces that have become a whole lot more familiar since this movie came out in 1998. Talking strictly in television terms that is Jennifer Love Hewitt from ""Party of Five,"" Ethan Embry from ""FreakyLinks,"" Lauren Ambrose, Freddy Rodr&iacute;guez, Eric Balfour and Peter Facinelli from ""Six Feet Under,"" Seth Green, Paige Moss and Amber Benson from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" Selma Blair from ""Zoe, Duncan, Jack & Jane,"" Nicole Bilderback from ""Dawson's Creek,"" Donald Faison from ""Felicity"" and ""Scrubs,"" and I am sure more, but that list is more than enough to prove my point. Oh, Jenna Elfman from ""Dharma and Greg"" and Melissa Joan Hart from ""Sabrina."" Should not forget those two.This is one of those movies when a senior class has a big blow out to celebrate graduation and some house gets totally trashed while the parents are away. This year the party is at the house of Molly (Michelle Brookhurst), who is identified in the credits as ""Girl Whose Party It Is."" The major development is that Amanda Beckett (Love Hewitt), the prom/queen cheerleader has broken up with jock boyfriend Mike Dexter (Facinelli), which has inspired Preston Meyers (Ethan Embry) to have hope. He has loved her from afar for all four years of high school. An aspiring writer, Preston wrote a love letter to Amanda as a freshman and tonight he thinks fate is telling him to give her that letter. After all, Barry Manilow's ""Mandy"" is on the radio.The other three characters who would be seated at the dais are Denise Fleming (Ambrose), who is Preston's friend and apparently the only sane member of the senior class, William Lichter (Charlie Korsmo), the class super brain who comes to his first party armed with a chart that will help him figure out how much to drink and remain sober, and Kenny Fisher (Green), who has come to the party for the sole purpose of having sex that night and who talks like a black rapper despite the fact he is really, really white. He is not alone in this regard, although he will not run into some real African Americans who are not amused by their antics. Actually, ""Can't Hardly Wait"" is one of those movies where they try really hard to be amusing and it rarely works.Granted, part of the problem is that I am at the age where when I watch a movie like this I cannot help but have nightmarish visions of it being my house being destroyed by a teenager kegger. I should identify with Preston, since I did my fair share of pinning for high school girls from afar, but there is so much going on that he gets lost in the proceedings. Besides, Jennifer Love Hewitt gets the top billing but the stand out performance is Lauren Ambrose, which is exactly as it should be if we are talking most talented actress and most interesting character.I was leaning towards at least enjoying this film on its own terms, but then there was a scene where a blast from the past shows up at the party. Trip McNeely (Jerry O'Connell) and has a ""deep conversation"" with Mike Dexter, his heir as it were, and pretty much dumps a ""meaningful message"" into the film. I am not sure if it is too little too late or insult to injury, but it is one of those. That means that ""Porky's"" is a better film than this one (and funnier too). ""Can't Hardly Wait"" has a better soundtrack, which should not be the main reason for recommending a film, but in this case it is the truth. Still, as long as Lauren Ambrose is in a film you have a reason to see the DVD and not skip ahead directly to the CD.",3,Lauren Ambrose and a great soundtrack are not quite enough,1105056000,"01 7, 2005",2005,3719,"['Ca', ""n't"", 'Hardly', 'Wait', 'American', 'Graffiti', 'generation', 'actors', 'actresses', 'Not', 'classic', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'fondly', 'years', 'years', 'will', 'recognize', 'dozen', 'familiar', 'have', 'become', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'familiar', 'movie', 'came', 'out', '1998', 'Talking', 'strictly', 'television', 'terms', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'Party', 'Five', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'FreakyLinks', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'Freddy', 'Rodr', 'iacute', 'guez', 'Eric', 'Balfour', 'Peter', 'Facinelli', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Paige', 'Moss', 'Amber', 'Benson', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'Zoe', 'Duncan', 'Jack', 'Jane', 'Nicole', 'Bilderback', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'Donald', 'Faison', 'Felicity', 'Scrubs', 'am', 'sure', 'more', 'list', 'more', 'enough', 'prove', 'point', 'Oh', 'Jenna', 'Elfman', 'Dharma', 'Greg', 'Melissa', 'Joan', 'Hart', 'Sabrina', 'Should', 'not', 'forget', 'two.This', 'one', 'movies', 'when', 'senior', 'class', 'big', 'blow', 'celebrate', 'graduation', 'house', 'totally', 'trashed', 'parents', 'are', 'away', 'year', 'party', 'house', 'Molly', 'Michelle', 'Brookhurst', 'who', 'identified', 'credits', 'Girl', 'Whose', 'Party', 'major', 'development', 'Amanda', 'Beckett', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'prom/queen', 'cheerleader', 'broken', 'up', 'jock', 'boyfriend', 'Mike', 'Dexter', 'Facinelli', 'inspired', 'Preston', 'Meyers', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'have', 'hope', 'loved', 'afar', 'four', 'years', 'high', 'school', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'Preston', 'wrote', 'love', 'letter', 'Amanda', 'freshman', 'tonight', 'fate', 'telling', 'give', 'letter', 'Barry', 'Manilow', 'Mandy', 'radio.The', 'other', 'three', 'characters', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'seated', 'dais', 'are', 'Denise', 'Fleming', 'Ambrose', 'who', 'Preston', 'friend', 'apparently', 'only', 'sane', 'member', 'senior', 'class', 'William', 'Lichter', 'Charlie', 'Korsmo', 'class', 'super', 'brain', 'who', 'first', 'party', 'armed', 'chart', 'will', 'help', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'much', 'drink', 'remain', 'sober', 'Kenny', 'Fisher', 'Green', 'who', 'come', 'party', 'sole', 'purpose', 'having', 'sex', 'night', 'who', 'talks', 'black', 'rapper', 'fact', 'really', 'really', 'white', 'not', 'alone', 'regard', 'will', 'not', 'run', 'real', 'African', 'Americans', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'amused', 'antics', 'Actually', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Hardly', 'Wait', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'try', 'really', 'hard', 'be', 'amusing', 'rarely', 'works.Granted', 'part', 'problem', 'am', 'age', 'where', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'have', 'nightmarish', 'visions', 'being', 'house', 'being', 'destroyed', 'teenager', 'kegger', 'should', 'identify', 'Preston', 'did', 'fair', 'share', 'pinning', 'high', 'school', 'girls', 'afar', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'lost', 'proceedings', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'top', 'billing', 'stand', 'out', 'performance', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'exactly', 'should', 'be', 'are', 'talking', 'most', 'talented', 'actress', 'most', 'interesting', 'character.I', 'was', 'leaning', 'towards', 'least', 'enjoying', 'film', 'own', 'terms', 'then', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'blast', 'past', 'up', 'party', 'Trip', 'McNeely', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'deep', 'conversation', 'Mike', 'Dexter', 'heir', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'meaningful', 'message', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'insult', 'injury', 'one', 'Porky', 'better', 'film', 'one', 'funnier', 'too', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Hardly', 'Wait', 'better', 'soundtrack', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'main', 'reason', 'recommending', 'film', 'case', 'truth', 'Still', 'as', 'long', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'film', 'have', 'reason', 'see', 'DVD', 'not', 'skip', 'ahead', 'directly', 'CD']",N/A

I have my opinion.When I saw this film, I wasn't expecting much, but it was great. It's not because I am some punk kid who likes that music,  that's not it. Every year, there's a movie like this that hits where it  needs to. In the 70's, it was AMERICAN GRAFFITI, in the 80's, it was  SIXTEEN CANDLES. Now, in the 90's, it's CAN'T HARDLY WAIT. This is an  honest look at how the kids in my generation live their life. And I really  don't understand why parents and critics can bash this. It's basically a  90's word-for-word re-hash of Lucas's classic film. It has the young kid  who is going away and wants to fall in love...just like RICHARD DREYFUSS in  A.G. It has the nerd who basically gets a woman that he never expects to  get. It has the language and racial slang just like AG had. And the music  is constantly going in the background, one song after another, only it's  our decade and our generation's hits.And it's all shown in one night. I  mean watch one after the other back to back. It's basically the same. Kind  of like watching EMMA and CLUELESS, it's another interpretation.I don't  think the film is worthy of an Oscar, but it is cute and harmless.

You feel as wrecked as the partying kids on the screen.Co-written and co-directed by a pair of newcomers, Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan, &quot;Can't Hardly Wait&quot; (which was titled &quot;The Party&quot; up until about a month ago) is essentially a shameless rip-off of Richard Linklater's 1993 film, &quot;Dazed and Confused,&quot; an insightful period piece set in 1976 about suburban Texas teens carousing on the last day of school.There are also bits and pieces here from &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High,&quot; &quot;American Graffiti,&quot; &quot;Animal House,&quot; &quot;16 Candles&quot; and even the ancient &quot;Bye Bye Birdie,&quot; but most of the ideas come from Linklater's movie.We get the &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; connection right off when Elfont and Kaplan stage a non-singing variation on &quot;The Telephone Hour&quot; from that film, in which one teen gossips to another, spreading the word that the graduating class' golden couple, Top Jock Mike (Peter Facinelli) and Homecoming Queen Amanda (Jennifer Love Hewitt), have broken up. Mike is going off to college and now has no time for high school girls.This leaves the field open for Preston (Ethan Embry), an introverted, brainy kid who has nursed a crush on Amanda for four years and now plans to take action. Interwoven throughout the all-nighter are several missed encounters between Amanda and Preston, as well as subplots about a white kid who thinks he's African American (Seth Green), a geek (Charlie Korsmo) and his two sycophants (characters who are direct steals from &quot;16 Candles&quot;) and the class cynic (Lauren Ambrose), the only intelligent person on hand, whose favorite quote is Oscar Wilde's &quot;A true friend stabs you in the front.&quot;Actually, the young cast works wonders with this material. There really isn't a bad performance here, with Embry, Ambrose and especially Hewitt turning in impressively self-composed work. The filmmakers tease us with Hewitt's character, at first only showing her in bits and pieces (sort of like Godzilla in its movie). But once Hewitt gets her first movie-star close-up, the audience went wild and applauded as if she were the Meryl Streep of Teen Trash.Hewitt is a sweet, pleasing presence who almost redeems the junkiness of the movie surrounding her.There are also cameos by TV's Jenna Elfman (&quot;Dharma and Greg&quot;) as an erotic dancer and Melissa Joan Hart (&quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot;), who's funny as &quot;The Yearbook Girl,&quot; a dweeb intent on getting as many autographs in her yearbook as possible. And Jerry O'Connell (&quot;Scream 2&quot;) pops up as a former high-school prince who has gone to pot.He's playing the role that Matthew McConaughey nailed so perfectly in &quot;Dazed and Confused,&quot; a film also noted for early screen appearances by Ben Affleck, Parker Posey, Rene Zellweger, Milla Jovovich, Rory Cochrane, Jason London and Joey Lauren Adams. You might want to check it out. It achieves what &quot;Can't Hardly Wait&quot; only timidly hints at -- the giddy class structure among teenagers.It also makes partying look like a lot more fun.",5,Can't Hardly Wait,1069718400,"11 25, 2003",2003,3436,"['first', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'plotless', 'post-graduation', 'all-night', 'party', 'torturous', 'least', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'moron', 'masochist', 'once', ""'re"", 'pulled', 'forced', 'fun', 'piece', 'accept', 'noise', 'pain', 'subsides', 'something', 'merely', 'blinding', 'numbing', 'feel', 'as', 'wrecked', 'partying', 'kids', 'screen.Co-written', 'co-directed', 'pair', 'newcomers', 'Harry', 'Elfont', 'Deborah', 'Kaplan', 'quot', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Hardly', 'Wait', 'quot', 'was', 'titled', 'quot', 'Party', 'quot', 'up', 'month', 'ago', 'essentially', 'shameless', 'rip-off', 'Richard', 'Linklater', '1993', 'film', 'quot', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'quot', 'insightful', 'period', 'piece', 'set', '1976', 'suburban', 'Texas', 'carousing', 'last', 'day', 'school.There', 'are', 'also', 'bits', 'pieces', 'here', 'quot', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'quot', 'quot', 'American', 'Graffiti', 'quot', 'quot', 'Animal', 'House', 'quot', 'quot', '16', 'Candles', 'quot', 'even', 'ancient', 'quot', 'Bye', 'Bye', 'Birdie', 'quot', 'most', 'ideas', 'come', 'Linklater', 'movie.We', 'get', 'quot', 'Bye', 'Bye', 'Birdie', 'quot', 'connection', 'right', 'off', 'when', 'Elfont', 'Kaplan', 'stage', 'non-singing', 'variation', 'quot', 'Telephone', 'Hour', 'quot', 'film', 'one', 'teen', 'gossips', 'spreading', 'word', 'graduating', 'class', 'golden', 'couple', 'Top', 'Jock', 'Mike', 'Peter', 'Facinelli', 'Homecoming', 'Queen', 'Amanda', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'have', 'broken', 'up', 'Mike', 'going', 'off', 'college', 'now', 'time', 'high', 'school', 'girls.This', 'field', 'open', 'Preston', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'introverted', 'brainy', 'kid', 'who', 'nursed', 'crush', 'Amanda', 'four', 'years', 'now', 'take', 'action', 'Interwoven', 'all-nighter', 'are', 'several', 'missed', 'encounters', 'Amanda', 'Preston', 'as', 'well', 'subplots', 'white', 'kid', 'who', 'African', 'American', 'Seth', 'Green', 'geek', 'Charlie', 'Korsmo', 'two', 'sycophants', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'direct', 'steals', 'quot', '16', 'Candles', 'quot', 'class', 'cynic', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'only', 'intelligent', 'person', 'hand', 'favorite', 'quote', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'quot', 'A', 'true', 'friend', 'stabs', 'front.', 'quot', 'Actually', 'young', 'cast', 'wonders', 'material', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'performance', 'here', 'Embry', 'Ambrose', 'especially', 'Hewitt', 'turning', 'impressively', 'self-composed', 'work', 'filmmakers', 'tease', 'Hewitt', 'character', 'first', 'only', 'showing', 'bits', 'pieces', 'sort', 'like', 'Godzilla', 'movie', 'once', 'Hewitt', 'first', 'movie-star', 'close-up', 'audience', 'went', 'wild', 'applauded', 'were', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Teen', 'Trash.Hewitt', 'sweet', 'pleasing', 'presence', 'who', 'almost', 'junkiness', 'movie', 'surrounding', 'her.There', 'are', 'also', 'cameos', 'TV', 'Jenna', 'Elfman', 'quot', 'Dharma', 'Greg', 'quot', 'erotic', 'dancer', 'Melissa', 'Joan', 'Hart', 'quot', 'Sabrina', 'Teenage', 'Witch', 'quot', 'who', 'funny', 'quot', 'Yearbook', 'Girl', 'quot', 'dweeb', 'intent', 'getting', 'many', 'autographs', 'yearbook', 'possible', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'quot', 'Scream', '2', 'quot', 'up', 'former', 'high-school', 'prince', 'who', 'gone', 'pot.He', 'playing', 'role', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'nailed', 'so', 'perfectly', 'quot', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'quot', 'film', 'also', 'noted', 'early', 'screen', 'appearances', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'Rene', 'Zellweger', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'Rory', 'Cochrane', 'Jason', 'London', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'what', 'quot', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Hardly', 'Wait', 'quot', 'only', 'timidly', 'hints', 'giddy', 'class', 'structure', 'teenagers.It', 'also', 'partying', 'look', 'lot', 'more', 'fun']",N/A

12836,AIJ0DEHA822CS,0767816617,"Ricky Pooski ""cool""","[1, 1]","Every 7-10 years, there's a teen comedy that might not be particularly brilliant but is very enjoyable and works just a little harder at winning your affection. The characters are slightly more real than their stereotypes even if the storyline is pretty standard. It makes you wish that the lazy screenwriters of other high school movies would actually put in the same miniscule effort. Usually you know which movie it is by the fact that you know many of the actors from later material. In the early 80s, the movie wasFast Times at Ridgemont High (Widescreen Special Edition)(which the AV Club has called Hollywood's Yearbook). In the early 90s, it wasDazed & Confused (Widescreen Flashback Edition)and in 1998, it was this one.Even though the characters are very standard - the white kid that acts black, the serious girl, the teen queen, the evil jock, the nerd, the stoner (although the unfortunate decision to make this PG-13 ran up against the draconian MPAA's iron fist so the stoners must pretend otherwise as if this is the Golden Age of Censorship) - the actors playing them get more leverage out of them and the script lets them be more than their roles. Peter Farinelli's evil jock character is capable of sweetness if only when wasted. Charlie Korsmo as the nerd that loosens up is almost believeable as both the nerd and the nerd that everyone wants to make out with. Seth Green broke out of his Buffy rut and went all out for a character that could have been just a joke. The main character wanting to get with Jennifer Love Hewitt is boring, but when has the main plot in these ensemble teen movies ever been fun? (Was there even a main plot in Dazed & COnfused? I think the football player refusing to sign the drug statement counts)And what's even more fun from the 10 year anniversary perspective is the presence of actors that you know and like in supporting roles. You get Amber Benson as banana girl, Jason Siegal lovingly eating a watermelon (and 11 years later that seems to be his main acting choice onHow I Met Your Mother: Season Four- but it's still funny) and Donald Faison as the drummer that wants to wear the cowboy hat.The original commentary track is pretty standard (Seth Green's fake British accent is annoying and I'm happy that they stop it 15 minutes in) but the 10 year anniversary track is one of those drinking commentary tracks that people just love. And it's completely appropriate and worth the price.All in all, this is one of those movies that's consistently enjoyable. Not too deep but invested enough in its characters to overcome the cliches of the genre. And the 10 year commentary puts everything into perspective, as this is the movie that makes viewers feel like they are coming back home to see old friends.",5,Still fun after all these years,1249171200,"08 2, 2009",2009,2762,"['7-10', 'years', 'teen', 'comedy', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'particularly', 'brilliant', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'just', 'little', 'harder', 'winning', 'affection', 'characters', 'are', 'slightly', 'more', 'real', 'stereotypes', 'even', 'storyline', 'pretty', 'standard', 'wish', 'lazy', 'screenwriters', 'other', 'high', 'school', 'movies', 'would', 'actually', 'put', 'same', 'miniscule', 'effort', 'Usually', 'know', 'movie', 'fact', 'know', 'many', 'actors', 'later', 'material', 'early', '80s', 'movie', 'wasFast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'Widescreen', 'Special', 'Edition', 'AV', 'Club', 'called', 'Hollywood', 'Yearbook', 'early', '90s', 'wasDazed', 'Confused', 'Widescreen', 'Flashback', 'Edition', '1998', 'was', 'one.Even', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'standard', 'white', 'kid', 'black', 'serious', 'girl', 'teen', 'queen', 'evil', 'jock', 'nerd', 'stoner', 'unfortunate', 'decision', 'make', 'PG-13', 'ran', 'up', 'draconian', 'MPAA', 'iron', 'fist', 'stoners', 'must', 'pretend', 'otherwise', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Censorship', 'actors', 'playing', 'get', 'more', 'leverage', 'script', 'be', 'more', 'roles', 'Peter', 'Farinelli', 'evil', 'jock', 'character', 'capable', 'sweetness', 'only', 'when', 'wasted', 'Charlie', 'Korsmo', 'nerd', 'up', 'almost', 'believeable', 'nerd', 'nerd', 'everyone', 'make', 'out', 'Seth', 'Green', 'broke', 'Buffy', 'rut', 'went', 'out', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'joke', 'main', 'character', 'wanting', 'get', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'boring', 'when', 'main', 'plot', 'ensemble', 'teen', 'movies', 'ever', 'been', 'fun', 'there', 'even', 'main', 'plot', 'Dazed', 'COnfused', 'think', 'football', 'player', 'refusing', 'sign', 'drug', 'statement', 'counts', 'what', 'even', 'more', 'fun', '10', 'year', 'anniversary', 'perspective', 'presence', 'actors', 'know', 'supporting', 'roles', 'get', 'Amber', 'Benson', 'banana', 'girl', 'Jason', 'Siegal', 'lovingly', 'eating', 'watermelon', '11', 'years', 'later', 'that', 'be', 'main', 'acting', 'choice', 'onHow', 'Met', 'Mother', 'Season', 'Four-', 'still', 'funny', 'Donald', 'Faison', 'drummer', 'wear', 'cowboy', 'hat.The', 'original', 'commentary', 'track', 'pretty', 'standard', 'Seth', 'Green', 'fake', 'British', 'accent', 'annoying', ""'m"", 'happy', 'stop', '15', 'minutes', '10', 'year', 'anniversary', 'track', 'one', 'drinking', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'people', 'just', 'love', 'completely', 'appropriate', 'worth', 'price.All', 'one', 'movies', 'consistently', 'enjoyable', 'Not', 'too', 'deep', 'invested', 'enough', 'characters', 'overcome', 'cliches', 'genre', '10', 'year', 'commentary', 'everything', 'perspective', 'movie', 'viewers', 'feel', 'are', 'coming', 'back', 'home', 'see', 'old', 'friends']",N/A

12841,A2EY2RBD9C3ZIR,0767816617,The Seeker,"[2, 2]","Released in the summer of 1998, ""Can't Hardly Wait"" is an American teen comedy that is directed by Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan, and it stars Jennifer Love Hewitt, Seth Green, Ethan Embry, Charlie Korsmo, Peter Facinelli, and Lauren Ambrose.The film takes place on graduation day of some seniors in high school and the students all go to this high school party and the whole film is like a teen soap opera, minus the drama. Well, a little drama, but not too much. There are several different major and minor storylines and there are a few main characters who have their own little adventures that night and grow as people. It's a coming-of-age movie.If you enjoy films like ""American Graffiti"" and ""Dazed and Confused"", you will also enjoy this movie.I think anyone who enjoyed high school or were like me and really wanted to enjoy high school and appreciated it can relate to what's going on in ""Can't Hardly Wait"" and can understand the message and get what it's trying to tell you and can feel just as sad and sentimental as I do about it. I feel like the film's message is very simple: Don't let fate pass you by. You only get so many chances in life and life is very short. Nothing lasts forever so take advantage while you can, or at least try to.It has a very bittersweet feel to it at times. It's all about growing up and moving on and saying goodbye to your youth and entering adulthood. This movie is a hard movie for me to watch because it really makes me miss high school and my youth and I can't help but have some feelings of regret.Please don't get the wrong idea. This movie isn't all tears or nothing like that. It's a very fun comedy full of laughs. It's just like how I feel when I watch the film ""Rocky Balboa"". That's a great and fun movie, but it has a sad feel to it knowing that it is Rocky Balboa's final boxing match and with this movie, it's the final night of high school/teenhood/childhood innocence for a lot those characters and as I typed, if you enjoyed high school or wanted to, watching it can make you feel extremely bittersweet.I first saw this movie in the winter of 1998 when I was 16. My sister and her friends were watching it and I was just in the living room where they were watching it at the time, using the family computer. I later watched it myself and liked it, but it was not until that following summer when I watched it again on HBO that the movie really affected me for the better.This film actually changed my life and my perspective of high school. You see, I was a very anti-social, bullied, disturbed, insecure, shy and fat nerdy kid who was just miserable all the time, but after seeing ""Can't Hardly Wait"", I realized how not only short high school is, but how precious it is and that I should enjoy it all while I can.I believe overall out of all the different types of people in the world, teenagers enjoy life more then anyone. Teenagers can enjoy all the good things about being children and being adults. Teenagers can do almost anything and get away with it. They also experience a lot of different things for the first time and that can be quite an adventure. They also discover who they are and who they will become because I believe who you are at 18 is who you are forever. Sure, you get a little smarter and mature as you age but overall, the person that you are is who you are always going to be whereas during your teen years, it can be a very confusing time and you slowly discover who you are based on whatever experiences you have or don't have as a teenager and if they are good experiences, you can have the time of your life.""Can't Hardly Wait"" is all about one last ride as a teenager for these teenage characters and is about letting go and moving on, but trying to take care of some final matters before moving onto adulthood because in my opinion life is never totally the same after high school.I think every teenager should watch ""Can't Hardly Wait"" and I hope they can learn the same lesson I learned from it and understand the message and will go out and try to enjoy high school. There's a reason why people have high school reunions and why some people lie about their age. I think almost all of us adults all long to return to those years or at least relive some of them as often as we can. So if you're a teenager, you're the envy of a lot of people. You only get to be a teenager once, but you have the rest of your life to be an adult. Don't mess this short-lived gift up. Please go out, make the most of it and enjoy it before it's taken away forever.",5,A very special film to me that changed my life.,1275091200,"05 29, 2010",2010,4547,"['Released', 'summer', '1998', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Hardly', 'Wait', 'American', 'teen', 'comedy', 'directed', 'Harry', 'Elfont', 'Deborah', 'Kaplan', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'Charlie', 'Korsmo', 'Peter', 'Facinelli', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose.The', 'film', 'place', 'graduation', 'day', 'seniors', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'go', 'high', 'school', 'party', 'whole', 'film', 'teen', 'soap', 'opera', 'drama', 'Well', 'little', 'drama', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'several', 'different', 'major', 'minor', 'storylines', 'are', 'few', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'own', 'little', 'adventures', 'night', 'grow', 'people', 'coming-of-age', 'movie.If', 'enjoy', 'films', 'American', 'Graffiti', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'will', 'also', 'enjoy', 'movie.I', 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'high', 'school', 'were', 'really', 'wanted', 'enjoy', 'high', 'school', 'appreciated', 'can', 'relate', 'what', 'going', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Hardly', 'Wait', 'can', 'understand', 'message', 'get', 'what', 'trying', 'tell', 'can', 'feel', 'just', 'sad', 'sentimental', 'do', 'feel', 'film', 'message', 'very', 'simple', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fate', 'pass', 'only', 'get', 'so', 'many', 'chances', 'life', 'life', 'very', 'short', 'Nothing', 'forever', 'so', 'take', 'advantage', 'can', 'least', 'try', 'to.It', 'very', 'bittersweet', 'feel', 'times', 'growing', 'up', 'moving', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'youth', 'entering', 'adulthood', 'movie', 'hard', 'movie', 'watch', 'really', 'miss', 'high', 'school', 'youth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'have', 'feelings', 'regret.Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'idea', 'movie', ""n't"", 'tears', 'nothing', 'very', 'fun', 'comedy', 'full', 'laughs', 'just', 'how', 'feel', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'great', 'fun', 'movie', 'sad', 'feel', 'knowing', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'final', 'boxing', 'match', 'movie', 'final', 'night', 'high', 'school/teenhood/childhood', 'innocence', 'lot', 'characters', 'typed', 'enjoyed', 'high', 'school', 'wanted', 'watching', 'can', 'make', 'feel', 'extremely', 'bittersweet.I', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'winter', '1998', 'when', 'was', '16', 'sister', 'friends', 'were', 'watching', 'was', 'just', 'living', 'room', 'where', 'were', 'watching', 'time', 'using', 'family', 'computer', 'later', 'watched', 'liked', 'was', 'not', 'following', 'summer', 'when', 'watched', 'again', 'HBO', 'movie', 'really', 'affected', 'better.This', 'film', 'actually', 'changed', 'life', 'perspective', 'high', 'school', 'see', 'was', 'very', 'anti-social', 'bullied', 'disturbed', 'insecure', 'shy', 'fat', 'nerdy', 'kid', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'miserable', 'time', 'seeing', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Hardly', 'Wait', 'realized', 'how', 'not', 'only', 'short', 'high', 'school', 'how', 'precious', 'should', 'enjoy', 'can.I', 'believe', 'overall', 'different', 'types', 'people', 'world', 'teenagers', 'enjoy', 'life', 'more', 'then', 'anyone', 'Teenagers', 'can', 'enjoy', 'good', 'things', 'being', 'children', 'being', 'adults', 'Teenagers', 'can', 'do', 'almost', 'anything', 'get', 'away', 'also', 'experience', 'lot', 'different', 'things', 'first', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'adventure', 'also', 'discover', 'who', 'are', 'who', 'will', 'become', 'believe', 'who', 'are', '18', 'who', 'are', 'forever', 'Sure', 'get', 'little', 'smarter', 'mature', 'age', 'overall', 'person', 'are', 'who', 'are', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'whereas', 'teen', 'years', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'confusing', 'time', 'slowly', 'discover', 'who', 'are', 'based', 'experiences', 'have', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'teenager', 'are', 'good', 'experiences', 'can', 'have', 'time', 'life', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Hardly', 'Wait', 'one', 'last', 'ride', 'teenager', 'teenage', 'characters', 'letting', 'go', 'moving', 'trying', 'take', 'care', 'final', 'matters', 'moving', 'adulthood', 'opinion', 'life', 'never', 'totally', 'same', 'high', 'school.I', 'think', 'teenager', 'should', 'watch', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Hardly', 'Wait', 'hope', 'can', 'learn', 'same', 'lesson', 'learned', 'understand', 'message', 'will', 'go', 'out', 'try', 'enjoy', 'high', 'school', 'reason', 'why', 'people', 'have', 'high', 'school', 'reunions', 'why', 'people', 'lie', 'age', 'think', 'almost', 'adults', 'long', 'return', 'years', 'least', 'relive', 'as', 'often', 'can', 'So', ""'re"", 'teenager', ""'re"", 'envy', 'lot', 'people', 'only', 'get', 'be', 'teenager', 'once', 'have', 'rest', 'life', 'be', 'adult', 'Do', ""n't"", 'mess', 'short-lived', 'gift', 'up', 'Please', 'go', 'out', 'make', 'most', 'enjoy', 'taken', 'away', 'forever']",N/A

If there was any kind of realism to this movie, the guy wouldn't have got the girl. Trust me. In ""Can't Hardly Wait,"" a doofus wannabe writer had a crush on the most popular girl in school and he prepared a love letter for her so she would be his. Oh Mandy (Jennifer Love Hewitt), since the quarterback on the football team dumped you, you're no longer with the 'in-crowd.' High school drama smells. You have the two friends who drifted apart and got in touch with their feelings in a bathroom. You have the nerd who tried to get back at the quarterback and have his dweeb friends hang out on the roof of the house. Oh yeah, Jenna Elfman is an 'angel' and tells Preston (doofus) that she kissed Charlie from ""Charles in Charge."" What an accomplishment. This movie is for dreamers.
