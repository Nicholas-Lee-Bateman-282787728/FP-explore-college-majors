It's unseen in any other drama or detective program to my knowledge.  Unique as is so much of Pie In The Sky.Just plain full of surprises.  I very rarely predict events in the plot.Even has a men's bathroom urinal scene which seems to be a Brit specialty in cinema productions for the tele.Characters aplenty.  Very little terrible violence and very few morgue scenes.  Not Indy Jones nor tough punch-their-lights-out coppers or crooks.Other comments give details so please read them but no spoilers here, sorry.Plenty of one liners well timed and spoken with skill.  Brit irony bursting out wonderfully.  Is it a comedy, a soap, a whodunnit, or all of it?  Love it.At this price it is the steal of steals in daylight robbery in tele videos.  Some forty episodes, over 32 hours, a few tic-tocs short of 2000 minutes for this price?  Eh?  Sound and image are very very good and so is the packaging.

Nick Raggett (Henderson the restaurant's veggie grower and kitchen help) & Nicholas Lamont (Chef Gary) are well done, excuse the food pun. DS Sophia Cambridge (Bella Enahoro) is Crabbe's assigned aide in crime fighting, and beautiful waitress Nicola (Samantha Womack-""EastEnders"") is the best looking dish in the restaurant.

Griffiths is very good in this - indeed, he is the primary reason to watch it (Maggie Steed, as his wife, is very good, too). But the stories in the series are pretty lightweight. Indeed, it is difficult to categorize the series: the humorous elements are too low-key to make it a comedy, and the plots that engage the lead character's sleuthing skills are probably too lightweight to satisfy devotees of the mystery/police-procedural genre. The restaurant angle promised to be an offbeat element, but the restaurant was located on a street that always seemed to be deserted; the scenes inside it, especially the ones in the kitchen, lacked the energy of a real restaurant; and the restaurant, for me, was never more than a film set, and an obvious one at that.

1460410,A1SVO1B3CNJ7ZE,B005GP7EVC,Steven Larsen,"[9, 14]","A British detective drama with a leftist slant.  On the whole, Pie in the Sky tries to be a pleasant little show about crime and food.  The producers, as is often the case, don't seem satisfied with that, and insert left wing political and social messages into the show.  It isn't done in as heavy handed a manner as it is now, PitS was filmed in 95 I think, but someone has  an agenda for sure.  This is too bad, since for me, it ruins my enjoyment.An aging hippie who wants to preserve some aspect of the culture is portrayed sympathetically.  An upper class conservative type who wants to do the same is a villain.  Criminal activity by left wing characters is excused and even celebrated but not the other way.  Conservative politicians are of course portrayed as evil.One incident I found a bit disturbing was the show's take on sex and marriage.  Now personally, I don't get at all bent out of shape when I see pre marital sex on the screen.  In fact I don't think much about it.  Pie in the Sky however not only thinks about, they go out of their way to condem people who might practice abstinence before marriage.Worse, in the show, the male has sex with many females, but he loves and respects the girl he is to marry so much, that he wants it to be special.  For this is he portrayed as practically mentally ill.  I have know personally people who did not engage in sex before marriage and the reactions from people of all backrounds, varied.  Some thought it was fine, some a bit odd.  But never did anyone have the kind of shocked disgusted and outraged reaction that the character on Pie in the Sky had.Besides that, the show is about food.  Back in the mid 90s when it was filmed, the whole pretentious foodie thing was new.  Since then, foodies have multiplied like roaches and the food culture is getting a  bit tiring.  PitS seems a bit old in this regard.The show itself would only be 3 or 3.5 stars, even if I forgot about the whole left slant.  It doesn't do anything really well.  It certainly is not among the best of the British TV shows.  Just very average.Confession, I stopped watching this about a third of the way through the series.
