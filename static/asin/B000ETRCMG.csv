978636,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B000ETRCMG,A. Estes,"[19, 25]","""Live On The Other Side"" -- a concert captured on the eve of the release of Korn's seventh studio album, ""See You On The Other Side"" marks Korn's first performance in the states since the exit of co-founding guitarist, Brian ""Head"" Welch. Since Korn have had a rather big year since the release of the album, it was only natural that a live DVD was released to celebrate (or capitalize) on it. This concert very well could have been Korn's victory lap. A reminder to everyone that the guys have  still got it and they are still vital. And although they are, this concert and overall package just doesn't show that.Don't get me wrong. This is a good concert, good presentation, and decent extras. However, this is not Korn at their best. This concert was back in December, before the band really got their act together for their ""See You On The Other Side"" world tour. This means no back-up band, no cool imagery, and virtually no stage show. What this concert is, is the four members of Korn (and guitarist Rob Patterson stuffed in the back somewhere) simply rocking out the tried and true material at The Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City. Now, had Korn waited a few months and released something documenting their world tour, this DVD could have easily been more exciting. Those who saw them more recently know what I'm talking about. Not only did the back-up band help fill the empty spots, with some unique visuals and stage set-up, but the band was also in top form. Here, on this DVD, they're a little rusty.The setlist is a bit too safe as well. Basically, it's ""Greatest Hits, Vol. 1"" with a mere four songs from the new album. Sure, we all love hearing ""Got The Life"" ""Blind"" and ""A.D.I.D.A.S."" but for my money, the best part of the world tour was hearing old, but lesser-known favorites like ""Divine"" ""Clown"" and ""It's On"" mixing with the more experimental new stuff like ""Love Song"" and ""Tearjerker."" Everything about Korn's show clicked when I saw them. On this performance, however, it's a bit sterile, and need I say, overproduced. Considering this is a basic Korn concert, it would have benefited the whole production if they hadn't pro-tooled everything to death. But in it's defense, at least the cameras don't cut away every half-second, like on their last ""Live"" DVD (and there's no cheesy CGI images integrated either).The extras are mixed. The ""Coming Undone"" music video actually isn't the music video. Just the live performance. The ""Jukebox,"" likewise, is worthless, as it just lets you select which performances to watch. However, a documentary that follows the band onboard a plane with some fans/contest winners is a real treat. Not only do you get to hear a completely warped version of ""Here To Stay,"" but you'll also see Patterson performing with the band, unmasked and unhidden. This feature itself probably would have made a better DVD than what we got. I'm a huge Korn fan, and I'm pretty disappointed with this. What could have been a great opportunity to show a revitalized band is just predictable, going through the motions. For some reason, Korn just can't get it right with their live DVD's, and I don't understand why. Just go see them live, as soon as possible. The real thing is much, much better.",3,Not Korn At Their Best,1151625600,"06 30, 2006",2006,3244,"['Live', 'Other', 'Side', 'concert', 'captured', 'eve', 'release', 'Korn', 'seventh', 'studio', 'album', 'See', 'Other', 'Side', 'Korn', 'first', 'performance', 'states', 'exit', 'co-founding', 'guitarist', 'Brian', 'Head', 'Welch', 'Korn', 'have', 'had', 'rather', 'big', 'year', 'release', 'album', 'was', 'only', 'natural', 'live', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'celebrate', 'capitalize', 'concert', 'very', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Korn', 'victory', 'lap', 'reminder', 'everyone', 'guys', 'have', 'still', 'got', 'are', 'still', 'vital', 'are', 'concert', 'overall', 'package', 'just', ""n't"", 'show', 'that.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'good', 'concert', 'good', 'presentation', 'decent', 'extras', 'However', 'not', 'Korn', 'best', 'concert', 'was', 'back', 'December', 'band', 'really', 'got', 'act', 'together', 'See', 'Other', 'Side', 'world', 'tour', 'back-up', 'band', 'cool', 'imagery', 'virtually', 'stage', 'show', 'What', 'concert', 'four', 'members', 'Korn', 'guitarist', 'Rob', 'Patterson', 'stuffed', 'back', 'somewhere', 'simply', 'rocking', 'out', 'tried', 'true', 'material', 'Hammerstein', 'Ballroom', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Now', 'had', 'Korn', 'waited', 'few', 'months', 'released', 'something', 'documenting', 'world', 'tour', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'more', 'exciting', 'who', 'saw', 'more', 'recently', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'back-up', 'band', 'help', 'fill', 'empty', 'spots', 'unique', 'visuals', 'stage', 'set-up', 'band', 'was', 'also', 'top', 'form', 'Here', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'little', 'rusty.The', 'setlist', 'bit', 'too', 'safe', 'as', 'well', 'Basically', 'Greatest', 'Hits', 'Vol', '1', 'mere', 'four', 'songs', 'new', 'album', 'Sure', 'love', 'hearing', 'Got', 'Life', 'Blind', 'A.D.I.D.A.S', 'money', 'best', 'part', 'world', 'tour', 'was', 'hearing', 'old', 'lesser-known', 'favorites', 'Divine', 'Clown', 'mixing', 'more', 'experimental', 'new', 'stuff', 'Love', 'Song', 'Tearjerker', 'Everything', 'Korn', 'show', 'clicked', 'when', 'saw', 'performance', 'however', 'bit', 'sterile', 'need', 'say', 'overproduced', 'Considering', 'basic', 'Korn', 'concert', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'whole', 'production', 'had', ""n't"", 'pro-tooled', 'everything', 'death', 'defense', 'least', 'cameras', 'do', ""n't"", 'cut', 'away', 'half-second', 'last', 'Live', 'DVD', 'cheesy', 'CGI', 'integrated', 'either', '.The', 'extras', 'are', 'mixed', 'Coming', 'Undone', 'music', 'video', 'actually', ""n't"", 'music', 'video', 'Just', 'live', 'performance', 'Jukebox', 'likewise', 'worthless', 'just', 'select', 'watch', 'However', 'documentary', 'band', 'plane', 'fans/contest', 'winners', 'real', 'treat', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'get', 'hear', 'completely', 'warped', 'version', 'Here', 'Stay', ""'ll"", 'also', 'see', 'Patterson', 'performing', 'band', 'unmasked', 'unhidden', 'feature', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'DVD', 'what', 'got', ""'m"", 'huge', 'Korn', 'fan', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'disappointed', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'opportunity', 'show', 'revitalized', 'band', 'just', 'predictable', 'going', 'motions', 'reason', 'Korn', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'right', 'live', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Just', 'go', 'see', 'live', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'real', 'thing', 'much', 'much', 'better']",Korn Live On The Other Side

They don't care much for the label, but of course they've never adhered to any classification.  They push the boundaries every whichway that they can but always keep in mind the #1 priority: to ROCK.This DVD, 4th of the band's (counting the awesome performance at CBGB's on the Greatest Hits DVD), is sure to continue that priority.All KoRn fans know of the religiously-fueled departure of founding guitarist Brian ""Head"" Welch from the band over a year ago.  Though his out-of-the-blue (to us) exit was quite the blow for a lot of us, the rest of the band has certainly not been drug down.  If anything, they have become a more mighty beast, subtly modifying minor parts of their previous songs to rock harder as well as seeping with energy 10 fold of that before Head left (not to mention the incredibly innovative--if not a little TOO weird in a couple parts--latest album ""See You on the Other Side"").Presenting to our screens performances of newer monster-songs like ""Liar"" and ""Hypocrites"" as well as bringing back the classics (with a now meaner edge) like ""Freak on a Leash"", ""A.D.I.D.A.S."", and--of course--""Blind"", this high-def., explosive DVD from one of the mightiest bands of our time is sure to rock your socks clean off!!!",5,One less member... 10x THE POWER!,1146700800,"05 4, 2006",2006,1295,"['KoRn', 'often', 'been', 'called', 'inventors', 'nu-metal', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'label', 'course', ""'ve"", 'never', 'adhered', 'classification', 'push', 'boundaries', 'whichway', 'can', 'always', 'keep', 'mind', '1', 'priority', 'ROCK.This', 'DVD', '4th', 'band', 'counting', 'awesome', 'performance', 'CBGB', 'Greatest', 'Hits', 'DVD', 'sure', 'continue', 'priority.All', 'KoRn', 'fans', 'know', 'religiously-fueled', 'departure', 'founding', 'guitarist', 'Brian', 'Head', 'Welch', 'band', 'year', 'ago', 'out-of-the-blue', 'exit', 'was', 'quite', 'blow', 'lot', 'rest', 'band', 'certainly', 'not', 'been', 'drug', 'down', 'anything', 'have', 'become', 'more', 'mighty', 'beast', 'subtly', 'modifying', 'minor', 'parts', 'previous', 'songs', 'rock', 'harder', 'as', 'well', 'seeping', 'energy', '10', 'fold', 'Head', 'left', 'not', 'mention', 'incredibly', 'innovative', 'not', 'little', 'TOO', 'weird', 'couple', 'parts', 'latest', 'album', 'See', 'Other', 'Side', '.Presenting', 'screens', 'performances', 'newer', 'monster-songs', 'Liar', 'Hypocrites', 'as', 'well', 'bringing', 'back', 'classics', 'now', 'meaner', 'edge', 'Freak', 'Leash', 'A.D.I.D.A.S', 'course', 'Blind', 'high-def.', 'explosive', 'DVD', 'one', 'mightiest', 'bands', 'time', 'sure', 'rock', 'socks', 'clean']",Korn Live On The Other Side

The hits are presented, along with selections from their ""See You On The Other Side"" release.  Special features include a performance on an airplane with fans in tow.  Interesting idea, but the drowned out, weak sound just kills the songs.  Their previous live DVD ""Live"", which was performed on the release of their ""Untouchables"" CD, does a better job at capturing the real power of the band.

978640,A23LHYBAB2SXWC,B000ETRCMG,nin/ja77,"[0, 0]","Recorded live from the Hammerstein Ballroom(much like their Korn live Dvd) in 2005, ""Live on The Other side"" was the tour to support new album ""See You on the Other Side"" which was their first album to be recorded since the departure of guitarist Brian 'Head' Welch who had found God.So Korn rather than replace 'Head' became a four piece, while that might be fine in the studio, you know for the live gig's they would need a replacement guitarist, which they got in Robert Patterson who wouldn't become an official member, in fact on stage you wouldn't even be allowed to see him as he is hidden behind the speakers!! Yet you still catch a glimpse of him here and there. It's all rather embarrassing, their's plenty of bands who have touring members on tour with them, yet they don't hide them.The set list is mainly made up of older material, another thing to notice is that when they do the guitar solo in ""Another Brick In The Wall"" which used to be done by 'Head' but is now done by James 'Munky' Shaffer you realise he doesn't play it as good as him. 'Munky' Now being the main guitar player in the band now plays all 'Heads' parts and Patterson plays Munky's. Also for backing vocals such as in ""Somebody Someone"" 'Munky' now performs the backing vocals, however it's not the same. The older material stands out better than the material from ""See You On The Other Side"", songs such as ""A.D.I.D.A.S"", ""Got The Life"" and the brilliant ""Freak On A Leash"" sound great compared to ""Hypocrites"" and ""Liar"".Their is a few extra's such as performing for competition winners on a plane, this time Patterson is not covered up(surely they could have hid him in the toilet or something). They of course now play with a guitarist in sight and a keyboardist, it's just a pity they didn't do that for this tour.

Jonathan makes reference to his absence at the end of the show.  While 2002's ""Live"" DVD (at the same venue) had a rusty band and an overweight and out of shape Jonathan, this show has all (now 4) members in top form.However, the setlist is pretty basic, with a few songs from their ""See You On The Other Side"" album, with the rest being the usuals, such as ""Blind"", ""Freak on a Leash"", and ""Here to Stay"".  It would have been nice to see some rare stuff, but I think they, as they do with most releases, wanted to market this to the casual/former/non Korn fan.There is an awesome MTV 2 special as an extra feature, which shows (parts of) the now infamous ""airplane"" performance the band gave to a group of contest winners, with battery powered amps.  The advertise a ""Coming Undone"" video, but it's just basically an extra song from the same live show.  A ""jukebox"" feature is also present, but it just lets you choose one of the songs from the show.  Kind of a throwaway.The band would improve their live show over the next year, adding background singers and more visuals.  This is the second time they have released a Live DVD of a ""early"" performance.  I think a compilation of performances from several shows would be better.Apparently, a Family Values 2006 DVD is in the works, so perhaps that what we'll get.  But, this is a good DVD, and worth picking up.  The film quality is quite good as well, with a softer picture than other concert DVD's.  Remember when MTV changed film styles for the Video Music Awards a few years back, from the bright, ""LIVE"" cameras to a more news-like, film style?  That's what you get here, and the sound is great, too.Thumbs UP!",4,"Much better than the last Korn ""Live"" DVD.....",1159574400,"09 30, 2006",2006,1933,"['Released', 'Spring', '2006', 'hype', 'upcoming', 'Family', 'Values', 'tour', 'Live', 'Other', 'Side', 'decent', 'live', 'release', 'Korn', 'considering', 'was', 'first', 'one', 'first', 'live', 'performances', 'band', 'departure', 'Brian', 'Head', 'Welch', 'Jonathan', 'reference', 'absence', 'end', 'show', '2002', 'Live', 'DVD', 'same', 'venue', 'had', 'rusty', 'band', 'overweight', 'shape', 'Jonathan', 'show', 'now', '4', 'members', 'top', 'form.However', 'setlist', 'pretty', 'basic', 'few', 'songs', 'See', 'Other', 'Side', 'album', 'rest', 'being', 'usuals', 'such', 'Blind', 'Freak', 'Leash', 'Here', 'Stay', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'rare', 'stuff', 'think', 'do', 'most', 'releases', 'wanted', 'market', 'casual/former/non', 'Korn', 'awesome', 'MTV', '2', 'special', 'extra', 'feature', 'parts', 'now', 'infamous', 'airplane', 'performance', 'band', 'gave', 'group', 'contest', 'winners', 'battery', 'powered', 'amps', 'advertise', 'Coming', 'Undone', 'video', 'just', 'basically', 'extra', 'song', 'same', 'live', 'show', 'jukebox', 'feature', 'also', 'present', 'just', 'choose', 'one', 'songs', 'show', 'Kind', 'throwaway.The', 'band', 'would', 'improve', 'live', 'show', 'next', 'year', 'adding', 'background', 'singers', 'more', 'visuals', 'second', 'time', 'have', 'released', 'Live', 'DVD', 'early', 'performance', 'think', 'compilation', 'performances', 'several', 'shows', 'would', 'be', 'better.Apparently', 'Family', '2006', 'DVD', 'works', 'so', 'perhaps', 'what', ""'ll"", 'get', 'good', 'DVD', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'film', 'quality', 'quite', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'softer', 'picture', 'other', 'concert', 'DVD', 'Remember', 'when', 'MTV', 'changed', 'film', 'styles', 'Video', 'Music', 'Awards', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'bright', 'LIVE', 'cameras', 'more', 'news-like', 'film', 'style', 'what', 'get', 'here', 'sound', 'great', 'too.Thumbs', 'UP']",Korn Live On The Other Side
