I remember watching this with my sister as a kid. I love the whole thing and hopefully is as available in the future as it is now. The comparisons to Top Gun are unavoidable, like comparing the Stones to the Beatles. But, as it is with music comparisons, you can't look at Iron Eagle as a Top Gun rip off, it is in my opinion more entertaining and way better in it's own right. The final raid scene is complimemted by the awesome track by Dio ""Hide in the Rainbow"", when Doug rescues his dad at the end of a fire engulfed runway you just jump up and cheer. What a great moment! Im sure there are technical short comings as far as communications go but so what?Do you like a good old fashioned calvery rescue?

Often true of any series of movies, the first is so good it inspires sequels. I saw this movie during its first release. It was great then and it is still fun today. Surprisingly the aircraft are still used today and so it seems timely even now when you consider what is happening in Iraq. Filmed during Ronald Reagan's administration it is interesting how this could apply even today. All in all a stand out movie that is still fun to watch today. This is one most the family will enjoy.A high school graduate finds that his father has been shot down over a Middle Eastern country and is being held hostage. He has three days to rescue him before he will be hanged. He enlists the aid of his fellow flying club friends and a retired Air Force Colonel to concoct a plan to fly over and rescue his father. Good acting, great flying sequences, and excellent music soundtrack make this worth catching. I love the soundtrack, especially his flying song by Queen.

18676,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,0767827686,Chrijeff,"[1, 1]","Doug Masters (Jason Gedrick) is a high-school senior and an Air Force brat, the son of fighter pilot Col. Ted Masters (Tim Thomerson), a daring Cessna pilot and a hopeful AF pilot himself.  While awaiting his graduation on a base somewhere in the Southwest, he gets the word that his father has been forced to eject over a hostile Middle Eastern country (probably Libya), captured, tried, and condemned to death.  The Federal government doesn't seem to want to do anything to get him out, but Doug isn't giving up.  With the help of a band of dedicated friends, other AF kids who call themselves ""the Eagles,"" he obtains intelligence, fuel, computer time, maps, ammo, even a fraudulent flight plan (it helps that one of his best pals, Milo Bazen (Robbie Rist), is the son of the top Intel officer on base), then ropes Reserve Col. Charles ""Chappie"" Sinclair (Lou Gossett) into serving as his wingman in a desperate transatlantic flight to rescue the Colonel.The story may be a bit improbable, and the '80's opinions may not be PC, but you forget that once Doug gets into the air, whether in his Cessna or piloting a ""borrowed"" F-16 and hammering the living daylights out of enemy installations.  Indeed, in a world where American tolerance for military risk seems to diminish with every year that goes by, the movie is the kind that may just reignite your patriotism.  The aerial sequences are fantastic and worth the price in themselves, and whatever you say against Doug's methods, two things you have to grant him: he's brave as a lion, and he's not giving up till he saves his father.

I found Libya on the map. They seemed like some onery folk at the time. I was ready to drop some hellfire on them 'camel jockeys'.But I could never get a hold of an F-16.But judging by some of the reviews here, some lucky peepsqueaks DID manage to get F-16's. So many youths cite this piece of dreck as the reason they joined the airforce and are now doing the will of a commander-in-chief who probably goes back to his ranch, closes the door, and puts the 'Iron Eagle' DVD on!!Ultimate boys movie indeed.This doesn't change the fact that 'Iron Eagle' is unabashedly racist. It was mostly filmed in Israel with the IDF and Israeli government providing all the fighter jets AND pilots along with the scenery. All they asked for in return was that the villains be (nameless, faceless, dehumanized) 'Arabs' from a fictional (generic) Arab 'terrorist country'. This demonization of an entire people was (and is) an Israeli government PR campaign to get the American public to see the 'plight of the Jewish people' as they 'struggle' against the 'evil Arab terrorists'.I would hope the producers of 'Iron Eagle' were duped into going along with this. Because other than that, it is a pretty fine movie. Unlike a lot of 80's action-movie dreck, 'Iron Eagle' actually has likeable characters. Louis Gosset Jr. delivers a fine performance as the 'tough but fair' Colonel 'Chappy' Sinclaire. The action sequences rival and sometimes better the ones in 'Top Gun'. Plus, there is no sappy romance sub-plot to drag this puppy down. This movie is purely a boys film.So if you can turn your brain (and your conscience) off for an hour and 20 minutes, get a hold of 'Iron Eagle'. But watch out for the sequels. They're bad.

The kid has more simulator time than anyone on base (wherever that may be).  He's so into flying that he has a club of fellow high school aviators - officers' kids - who take their personal planes out on the weekends for fun...and to race paint-huffing morons on dirt-bikes through treacherous mountains.  He's a whiz at flying (but not acting).  Doug's happy little world halts when he finds out that not only did his application to the Air Force Academy get denied, but his father was also shot down, captured, and scheduled for a hanging in an undisclosed Middle Eastern country.Doug enlists the help of his flying buddies (two of which are Styles from Teen Wolf and the gay dude from Revenge of the Nerds) to hatch a rescue plan.  Along the way he manages to get the help of a retired Air Force Colonel named Chappy Sinclair (Louis Gossett Jr.) who just happens to have flown with Doug's father.  After the two find out that the U.S. government has their hands tied in red tape, Col. Chappy decides to put a plan into action.  He'll require the considerable talents, connections, and tricks of each member of the flight club.  They'll have to steal maps, get top secret armament information of the enemies, hack into government computers to get F16s with enough ammo (and flight plans) to take on an entire Arab country, and exploit every moron the Air Force could possible assemble on one facility in order to save Doug's father.After all the training, the shenanigans, and the ubiquitous 80s montage in which Louis Gossett Jr. shakes it to an old jukebox, the training mission gets the go ahead, and it's up to Doug and Chappy to rescue Doug's father from the evil, Arab terrorists (and not face long-term prison when and if they get back).If that isn't the most preposterous, far-fetched, Ben-Affleck-in-Armageddon-ridiculous premise for a movie, then someone has to fill me in on what tops it.This movie is one of the most enjoyably improbable movies of all time.

18688,A2K8LG0NQ7W5X0,0767827686,J. Collins,"[5, 15]","Ahh, ""Iron Eagle"".  A classic of the 1980's Golan-Globus production mill.  With the current spate of historic/""current"" military movies, it's sometimes good to see how Hollywood's come in trying to get the details right.  One can't do much better than using this flick as a baseline.  In case you aren't already familiar with this gem, Louis Gosset Jr. playing a reserve Air Force Colonel, and a teenage kid fly a mission inside an unnamed Arab country -OK I'll name it:  Libya- to rescue the kid's dad.  Pop gets shot-down when he's intercepted in international waters, but the US refuses to do anything more than diplomatic pressure.The kid and Lou Gosset meet up when the kid's challenged to race the local bully with his PLANE while the bully's using his dirt bike.  Suffice it to say he wins and impresses his babe; he doesn't get his slot at the USAF Academy, though. You gotta take the bad with good I guess.  When the words on Dad get back to the family, this kid uses his base ""network"" to get access to imagery, enemy air defense data, and two F16s carrying a B52's worth of ordinance.  All of this being done by his friends exploiting the dim bulbs who are their parents, no less.  (If only strike planning was this easy.)  Of course, the kid has flown training missions with his dad, and has a boatload of simulator time, so he's a natural to fly the mission.  He convinces Gosset to go along with him, and his two-ship is on the way.  The flying scenes are nothing spectacular, with obviously Israeli F16s playing the good guys, and Kfirs (modified Mirages) acting as MiGs.  Cockpit scenes are completely the imagination of the set designer; I'm guessing he never was anywhere near a real aircraft.  These are especially dated now as many computer flight sims are pretty darn accurate in cockpit, flight, and combat models.  Anyway, lots of explosions on the way in, Lou gets hit and aborts and our hero must press on alone-go figure.  He manages to talk with the evil dictator directly and get his dad on the runway for him to land (!) and pick him up.  More silliness ensues as he launches weapons on the ground, taxi's out and takesoff.  He kills the bad guy and heads home to find Lou punched out and was rescued.  Rather than the prison sentence for espionage, and theft of government property that Lou, the kid, his pals and the idiots they exploited on base should've got, he gets his slot at the Air Force Academy.  The end.Overall, I guess Lou's performance was fairly good, but everyone else performed at the grade-B level this flick is.  Note especially a very young Shawnee Smith as one of the kid's buds.  Worth seeing for laughs, and as a film version of a kid's pilot fantasy.",2,Just Plain Silly,1092700800,"08 17, 2004",2004,2704,"['Ahh', 'Iron', 'Eagle', 'classic', '1980', 'Golan-Globus', 'production', 'mill', 'current', 'spate', 'historic/', 'current', 'military', 'movies', 'sometimes', 'good', 'see', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'come', 'trying', 'get', 'details', 'right', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'better', 'using', 'flick', 'baseline', 'case', 'are', ""n't"", 'already', 'familiar', 'gem', 'Louis', 'Gosset', 'Jr.', 'playing', 'reserve', 'Air', 'Force', 'Colonel', 'teenage', 'kid', 'mission', 'unnamed', 'Arab', 'country', '-OK', ""'ll"", 'name', 'Libya-', 'rescue', 'kid', 'dad', 'Pop', 'shot-down', 'when', 'intercepted', 'international', 'waters', 'US', 'do', 'anything', 'more', 'diplomatic', 'pressure.The', 'kid', 'Lou', 'Gosset', 'meet', 'up', 'when', 'kid', 'challenged', 'race', 'local', 'bully', 'PLANE', 'bully', 'using', 'dirt', 'bike', 'Suffice', 'say', 'babe', ""n't"", 'get', 'slot', 'USAF', 'Academy', 'though', 'got', 'ta', 'take', 'bad', 'good', 'guess', 'When', 'words', 'Dad', 'get', 'back', 'family', 'kid', 'base', 'network', 'get', 'access', 'imagery', 'enemy', 'air', 'defense', 'data', 'two', 'F16s', 'carrying', 'B52', 'worth', 'ordinance', 'being', 'done', 'friends', 'exploiting', 'dim', 'bulbs', 'who', 'are', 'parents', 'less', 'only', 'strike', 'planning', 'was', 'easy', 'course', 'kid', 'flown', 'training', 'missions', 'dad', 'boatload', 'simulator', 'time', 'natural', 'fly', 'mission', 'Gosset', 'go', 'along', 'two-ship', 'way', 'flying', 'scenes', 'are', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'obviously', 'Israeli', 'F16s', 'playing', 'good', 'guys', 'Kfirs', 'modified', 'Mirages', 'acting', 'MiGs', 'Cockpit', 'scenes', 'are', 'completely', 'imagination', 'set', 'designer', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'never', 'was', 'anywhere', 'real', 'aircraft', 'are', 'especially', 'dated', 'now', 'many', 'computer', 'flight', 'sims', 'are', 'pretty', 'darn', 'accurate', 'cockpit', 'flight', 'combat', 'models', 'Anyway', 'lots', 'explosions', 'way', 'Lou', 'hit', 'aborts', 'hero', 'must', 'press', 'alone-go', 'figure', 'talk', 'evil', 'dictator', 'directly', 'get', 'dad', 'runway', 'land', 'up', 'More', 'silliness', 'ensues', 'weapons', 'ground', 'taxi', 'out', 'takesoff', 'bad', 'guy', 'home', 'find', 'Lou', 'punched', 'out', 'was', 'rescued', 'Rather', 'prison', 'sentence', 'espionage', 'theft', 'government', 'property', 'Lou', 'kid', 'pals', 'idiots', 'exploited', 'base', 'should', ""'ve"", 'got', 'slot', 'Air', 'Force', 'Academy', 'end.Overall', 'guess', 'Lou', 'performance', 'was', 'fairly', 'good', 'everyone', 'else', 'performed', 'grade-B', 'level', 'flick', 'Note', 'especially', 'very', 'young', 'Shawnee', 'Smith', 'one', 'kid', 'buds', 'Worth', 'seeing', 'laughs', 'film', 'version', 'kid', 'pilot', 'fantasy']",Iron Eagle

Munson,"[1, 1]","Jason Gedrick, Louis Gossett Jr., and Tim Thomerson star in this high-flying 80s action film about a pilot who is shot down and the lengths his son will go to save him.Thomerson stars as Col. Ted Masters.  He and his wingman are on a routine mission over the Mediterranean Sea when they are jumped by MIGs from a middle-eastern country.  The name of the country is never given, but, due to the time when the movie was made, it can be assumed to be Libya.  Masters and his wingman manage to shoot down three MIGs, but Masters himself is eventually shot down and captured.Meanwhile, Ted's son Doug (Gedrick) has become a fairly good pilot himself.  He and his friends have their own flying club, and they enjoy flying their Cessnas on the weekends.  Doug has an enemy in school who challenges him to fly ""the snake"", a dangerous canyon near the air force base.  Doug accepts and, even though someone messed with his plane, Doug still manages to win.  However, his victory is short-lived, for he soon finds out about his father's capture and impending trial.The U.S. Government is powerless to assist Doug's father, and Doug soon learns that his father has been found guilty of spying and is going to be hanged in three days.  With no other options available to him, Doug concocts his own plan to fly in and free his father himself.  He enlists the help of Col. ""Chappy"" Sinclair (Gossett).  Chappy is a retired pilot who lives on the base.  He's extremely reluctant to help Doug with his far-fetched plan but, after thinking it over, he decides to go along with it.Now its up to Doug's friends to somehow come up with two fully-loaded F-16s with a full combat load, refueling schedules, approved flight plans, and other necessary logistics to pull the plan off.  Sure enough, Doug's friends somehow manage to make all the necessary arrangements and Doug and Chappy are soon winging their way across the Med.  Will they succeed in rescuing Doug's father, or will they be too late?I enjoyed this movie a great deal.  Granted, the story is extremely far-fetched, but the action sequences are very good.  Gossett does a good job as Chappy, and Gedrick gives a good performance as Doug.

He hits it perfectly.There are some films that try to be something MORE than they are.  B-Movies are awful,  everyone knows it.  Movies like Iron Eagle, Red Dawn, Batman &amp; Robin, and Alien:  Resurrection are trying to be something they are not; attempting to be  better than they actually are by throwing more money at it, casting bigger  stars, rewriting the already confusing script to cover the plot holes, or  just painting the screen with violence and explosions so they can get the  male crowd to buy the ticket.  This film is rife with so many alarming  problems that make you wonder how funding for it got off the ground.  But,  it was mid-eighties and the Cold War, so we needed flicks that flexed the  American military might and insulted Middle Eastern countries.  This film  is an embarassment to the US Air Force (yes, I am a member) and is  characteristic of America's skewed prejudice of Middle Eastern countries.  The generalized depiction of these people is abhorrent and frankly very  embarassing to watch.  No wonder America seems to not understand that  region of the world.  We take movies more at face value than we should.  If  you want to kick back and just watch it and veg, fine.  Just don't think  it's a realistic and deep film.  It isn't.Easily the top film on my  list as the worst ever.  Funny thing is, if it's on, I watch it so I can  amuse myself by ripping it apart.  I guess you could watch it for the  flying sequences.

18700,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,0767827686,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[0, 1]","Jason Gedrick is Doug Masters, teen-pilot ace, son of a USAF fighter pilot, AF academy hopeful and high-school failure.  Doug is normally not that responsible a kid (mostly when tooling around in low-level air races in the family Cessna), but is forced to mature when his father is shot down and taken prisoner over an unnamed mideastern country.  A naturally gifted pilot, Doug has managed to cajole his father into taking him on some practice flights in the past, as well as worming his way into the base's F-16 simulator.  Now with the help of ""Chappy"" Sinclair (Louis Gosset Jr.), a crusty but not rusty reserve fighter pilot, and some of Doug's friends - a click of army-brat and aviation enthusiast-teens who populate the unnamed desert air force base where Doug's father stages - the younger Masters plans an impossible rescue.  Together with Chappie, Doug seizes a pair of twin-seat F-16's, loads them up to maximum payload, and flies into hostile territory.This movie came out in late 1985 and would have been toast had it appeared about six months later when ""Top Gun"" was released.  The premise is improbable, the flight scenes suffer in comparison to those in ""Top Gun"" (instead of the carefully choreographed dogfights and editing, IE has plenty of footage of the F-16's digital instruments - the flight scenes themselves look like stock footage and repetitive at that), special effects aren't great (enemy jets explode like toy models; the MiG blasted on the ground is not only an obvious dummy, but shot at the angle to make that most obvious; the sound is horrible)  and the realism is also pretty low apart from the premise - fully loaded F-16's aren't in any condition to dogfight (at least until the advent of the AIM-120 missile well after this movie came out), while flack guns seem almost entirely non-existent and enemy jets simply explode with the push of a button.Still, this was a fun movie and seemed to capture that sense of harmless (for our side anyway) jingoism of Reagan's 2nd term.  The plot goes a surprisingly long way into dealing with the inherent implausibility (Doug is good, but he's rough and his limits are well mapped out).  Also, much of the reason that IE falls behind TG has to do with the fact that F-16 isn't as photogenic as the F-14 (not that it's ugly - simply that it's smaller and hard to spot.  You simply see a speck that becomes an F-16 and disappears again in a flash, a deficiency on film that most F-16 pilots would doubtless prefer to live with).  The Israeli Kfir jets are quite convincing stand-ins for the MiG-23 (at the time, the US Marines flew leased Kfirs in dissimilar air-combat training), and only the most annoying military aviation enthusiasts will harp on how the USAF F-16's in the movie are painted according to Israeli colors (and how single-seat F-16A's mysteriously morph into twin-seat F-16B's and vica-versa).  Most of all, this was the first jet movie I'd really seen, and it was impressive enough for me to plunk down ($) for my first computer flight-sim program.  On a side-note, the soundtrack comes with ""One Vision"" by Queen, but the rest of the songs aren't up to that.  To get the song, I'd recommend Queen's own ""A Kind of Magic"" which also has some great tracks from the first Highlander movie.",3,Inferior but unforgettable air war flick,1007856000,"12 9, 2001",2001,3284,"['Jason', 'Gedrick', 'Doug', 'Masters', 'teen-pilot', 'ace', 'son', 'USAF', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'AF', 'hopeful', 'high-school', 'failure', 'Doug', 'normally', 'not', 'responsible', 'kid', 'mostly', 'when', 'tooling', 'around', 'low-level', 'air', 'races', 'family', 'Cessna', 'forced', 'mature', 'when', 'father', 'shot', 'down', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'unnamed', 'mideastern', 'country', 'naturally', 'gifted', 'pilot', 'Doug', 'managed', 'cajole', 'father', 'taking', 'practice', 'flights', 'past', 'as', 'well', 'worming', 'way', 'base', 'F-16', 'simulator', 'Now', 'help', 'Chappy', 'Sinclair', 'Louis', 'Gosset', 'Jr.', 'crusty', 'not', 'rusty', 'reserve', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'Doug', 'friends', 'click', 'army-brat', 'aviation', 'enthusiast-teens', 'who', 'populate', 'unnamed', 'desert', 'air', 'force', 'base', 'where', 'Doug', 'father', 'younger', 'Masters', 'impossible', 'rescue', 'Together', 'Chappie', 'Doug', 'pair', 'twin-seat', 'F-16', 'up', 'maximum', 'payload', 'flies', 'hostile', 'territory.This', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'late', '1985', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'toast', 'had', 'appeared', 'six', 'months', 'later', 'when', 'Top', 'Gun', 'was', 'released', 'premise', 'improbable', 'flight', 'scenes', 'suffer', 'comparison', 'Top', 'Gun', 'instead', 'carefully', 'choreographed', 'dogfights', 'editing', 'IE', 'plenty', 'footage', 'F-16', 'digital', 'instruments', 'flight', 'look', 'stock', 'footage', 'repetitive', 'special', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'enemy', 'jets', 'explode', 'toy', 'models', 'MiG', 'blasted', 'ground', 'not', 'only', 'obvious', 'dummy', 'shot', 'angle', 'make', 'most', 'obvious', 'sound', 'horrible', 'realism', 'also', 'pretty', 'low', 'apart', 'premise', 'fully', 'loaded', 'F-16', 'are', ""n't"", 'condition', 'dogfight', 'least', 'advent', 'AIM-120', 'missile', 'well', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'flack', 'guns', 'seem', 'almost', 'entirely', 'non-existent', 'enemy', 'jets', 'simply', 'explode', 'push', 'button.Still', 'was', 'fun', 'movie', 'seemed', 'capture', 'sense', 'harmless', 'side', 'anyway', 'jingoism', 'Reagan', '2nd', 'term', 'plot', 'surprisingly', 'long', 'way', 'dealing', 'inherent', 'implausibility', 'Doug', 'good', 'rough', 'limits', 'are', 'well', 'mapped', 'out', 'Also', 'much', 'reason', 'IE', 'TG', 'do', 'fact', 'F-16', ""n't"", 'as', 'photogenic', 'F-14', 'not', 'ugly', 'simply', 'smaller', 'hard', 'spot', 'simply', 'see', 'speck', 'F-16', 'disappears', 'again', 'flash', 'deficiency', 'film', 'most', 'F-16', 'pilots', 'would', 'doubtless', 'prefer', 'live', 'Israeli', 'Kfir', 'jets', 'are', 'quite', 'convincing', 'stand-ins', 'MiG-23', 'time', 'US', 'Marines', 'flew', 'leased', 'Kfirs', 'dissimilar', 'air-combat', 'training', 'only', 'most', 'annoying', 'military', 'aviation', 'enthusiasts', 'will', 'harp', 'how', 'USAF', 'F-16', 'movie', 'are', 'painted', 'according', 'Israeli', 'colors', 'how', 'single-seat', 'F-16A', 'mysteriously', 'twin-seat', 'F-16B', 'vica-versa', 'Most', 'was', 'first', 'jet', 'movie', ""'d"", 'really', 'seen', 'was', 'impressive', 'enough', 'plunk', 'down', 'first', 'computer', 'flight-sim', 'program', 'side-note', 'soundtrack', 'One', 'Vision', 'Queen', 'rest', 'songs', 'are', ""n't"", 'up', 'get', 'song', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Queen', 'own', 'A', 'Kind', 'Magic', 'also', 'great', 'tracks', 'first', 'Highlander', 'movie']",Iron Eagle
