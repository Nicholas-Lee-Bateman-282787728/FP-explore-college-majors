If you haven't, there will be spoilers.  Even if you have, plot points will be mentioned but hopefully not enough to ruin the show.If Season One of this now legendary show set up the basic situation of the high-school chem teacher and his slacker assistant who go into meth ""cooking"" to earn lots of money, and Season Two puts the Walter-and-Jesse duo into the big time, introducing new characters as it goes, then Season Three essentially doubles down on prior elements.  Everyone wants more of what they want, and what they want is irreconcilable:  Walter's wife Skyler wants him at home more (a guaranteed impossibility considering his lab schedule); but when he moves back in she isn't happy with that either.  Late in Season Two we were introduced to Gus (Giancarlo Esposito), a mild-mannered chicken-franchise operator, but as Season Three progresses, he proves to have a much bigger profile underground than merely as proprietor of ""Los Pollos Hermanos."" Jesse, having suffered a tremendous personal loss, wants to stay as messed up as possible, which makes his work performance suffer.  He goes in and out of rehab.  Walter in fact suffers a new lab partner, Gale, a granola kind of guy who proves to be surprisingly unimaginative as a chemist.  Meanwhile Walt's brother-in-law Hank is perplexed by the evidence of major drug trafficking going on nearby, but Walt is darn sure he doesn't realize quite how close nearby.  And as always in the BREAKING BAD moral universe, things don't stay ""copacetic"" very long.It isn't necessarily everyone's favorite episode, clocking a mere 3.4 out of 5 at shareTV.com, but my favorite episode of Season Three is number 10, ""Fly,"" which quite frankly is a low-budget number that takes place in the gleaming new high-tech lab, featuring Walter and Jesse, with no exterior shots or special effects.  A housefly gets into the chamber, and Walter, who will brook no ""contaminant"" in his stainless-steel kingdom, is driven close to mad.  It takes the whole episode to learn if the fly ever gets killed, but every tone in the Walt-and-Jesse relationship is sounded, especially the ones that remind us the men drive each other crazy but depend on each other nonetheless.There isn't much television that goes on this long, so well, with such great writing and acting, all the while managing to maintain elements of sitcom, black comedy, social satire, drug culture and the Modern Western.

The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called &#34;The Turn&#34;. The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back.

1319248,A150QS4IZB3XJ,B0032UYFA6,"April Vawter ""Wilderness Photographer""","[5, 6]","There are two near-perfect very dark comedies on TV still in production.  One is Dexter, which is totally different in every way except excellence.Breaking Bad is an absolute masterpiece portrayal of the human condition taken to the max.  Every episode weaves into every other episode, as do our lives from day to day.  The acting is more like life-portraits...amazing.  The videography is absolute artistry without the bogus melodrama of the CSIs and other lesser series.Season 3 is far darker than the first two.  The intensity never ends, and as it would be in life, the laughs are less.  We find ourselves laughing at our own foibles as portrayed by the characters in this amazing ensemble.  We also know that with each increasingly darker turn that our inner psyches could be on the same level as theirs, given dire enough circumstances.I will not give away plot-lines to those who have not been fortunate enough to watch through the season.  If, for any reason, you have not seen the first two seasons, there is only one way to watch...From the beginning!  The seven episodes of season one and the full run from season two cannot be missed.  Even purchasing the series on Video on Demand, I will still purchase the disks, which, since Roku, has become far less of a habit.You are left with an incredible cliff-hanger at the end of the season, and the previous review came as closer or closer to informing those who haven't seen it than is really fair.  The less details you know, the better off you and your imagination are as you cling to your seat through each and every episode.I will let one cat out of the bag.  Season four will not begin until July of 2011.  I seldom plan on or for anything past tomorrow, but I will wait for it eagerly every day.  I don't know how many times I will watch the series over and again in the next year, but I get the feeling that I will remember nearly every word of every wonderful, sinister, heart-thumping roller coaster each episode has to offer.I honestly never knew television could be this good.  Better call Saul!Oh yeah, I will give away something.

But with millions of $$ rolling in and all of the pressures any drug dealer would be expected to face, this show keeps you on the edge of your seat!!!It's extremely well-written and has so many twists and turns that you will get drawn in and hooked! I seriously thought I was going to be nice and watch a series with my husband that only he liked but boy was I wrong!!! It's GREAT!! The characters are well developed and well cast and I found myself riveted to each episode wanting to watch more. And because we were so late to the game, we were able to watch each season non-stop; sometimes three episodes in one evening because we couldn't get enough and couldn't wait to see what happened next.I can't imagine anyone that won't love this series; ok - it's about drug dealing, but it's just a tv show - and it's well worth watching.

Season three is where I started to see one too many events that were hard to believe (spoilers so at end of this review).  But then I began to see that I shouldnt be expecting this to be realistic film noir. BB sure has elements of film noir crime films but i started to see a comic zaniness to it as well.  Not that its all just silliness but it definitely is more expressionistic than realistic.  So I enjoyed it more accepting its artistic dramatic flourishes.  The characters motivations do not seem as clear as in the prior episodes and as mentioned some events are pure hollywood just in the nick of time stuff.  But by now the characters had already gotten me too involved and they are definitely characters.  Walt is impulsive, Jesse is directionless, Gus is too obsessed with some issues to really be an efficient kingpin.  Ironically Saul Goodman is the most clear headed though he is straight out of Looney Tunes.  So it can be more appreciated for these somewhat larger than life characterizations.  That said season four has more creativity so season three is kind of the transitional one.  In any case its unlikely anyone would watch breaking bad and skip this season.  I would rate seasons two and four with five stars and the others with four so they are all above average.  seasnon one is a bit slow and after season four it gets a little too crazy and is mostly about walt whites insane love of power and respect.parts hard to believe (poss spoilers): why did Jesse go back to drugs and selling them after his girlfiend od's?

Careful viewing reveals nods between episodes, and I love this attention to detail in the script.As I noted in the previous two seasons, the acting all around is superb, but much of the success of this show is due to Bryan Cranston in his portrayal of Walter White.****Spoiler****My favorite episode in season three is ""Kafakaesque"".  The scene where Walter's wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) spins a story about how Walter can manage to cover Hank's hospital bills is just amazing to watch if you've seen all the previous episodes up to this point.

My only worry is that they may have almost jumped the shark at certain points in the season, I don't know how they'll top what happened in the 4th season. There is a lot of evolution in these characters, and maybe at times a growing insanity. I did like how they slightly redeemed the character of Walt's wife in the second half of the season.

Season Three ended up garnering even more acclaim, and this DVD set contains all 13 episodes of that season that originally aired on AMC in the spring of 2010.This season was one in which relationships between the characters became increasingly strained during the intriguing plot twists of these episodes.  Walter (Bryan Cranston) struggles to hold himself together as his marriage to Skyler (Anna Gunn) unravels and he faces struggles with his conscience and psychological fallout from his activity in the meth business and his life of deceit.The relationship between Walt and Jesse (Aaron Paul) takes several turns as well--the two have differences based on education and socioeconomic status, but a key sequence also brings to light the difference between Jesse's impetuous, youthful ways and Walt's more calculating, middle-aged outlook.  Season Three also continues to show the negative impact, some of which they are not even aware of, that the behavior of the two have on others.As in the first two seasons, the scenes of the New Mexico desert become another star in the series, and series creator Vince Gilligan provides great insight while briefly discussing each episode on one of the special features on this DVD set.

Season 3 had some great moments and continued the downward spiral of the shows characters, some of them without even realizing it. The seduction of money is at the root of most of the evil in this show. Excessive pride and arrogance is the other major culprit.While this was a good season the show continues to become more like a Hollywood movie as it gets a little over the top in parts, and pushes the believability factor. They need to keep things interesting and exciting, but I hope they don't abandoned the realizm that was at the heart of the first season, and has been one of the show's great strengths.(Spoilers)Walt's relationship with Jessie is nearing a skitzo one as in some episodes he is done with him, even mocking him, and in other episodes he puts his life on the line and everything he's worked for to save him. Both did very bad things they didn't want or have to do, to help each other out this season. Both killed in cold blood and have crossed lines that can't be uncrossed. Interestingly enough, Jessie, despite being a dumber, street junkie, seems to have a more inherent morality then Walt, when it comes down to it.The personalities and politics of the drug trade are taking their tole, and people are suffering and dying because it. I'm curious to see what role or response other family will have when and if they learn the truth about Walt's money, especially Hank & Maria, now that they have unknowingly benefitted from it.There were some tense moments this season, including Hank's near capture of Walt & Jessie, Hanks blowout on Jessie, and the  attack on Hank by the Mexican cartel cousins. Not forgetting Jessie's showdown with the drug dealers and Walt's near executions. I'm curious to see how Season 4 will transpire, given the current state of affairs, the relationship between Walt and Gus is likely to only get worse, meaning some drastic changes will have to be made.If you enjoyed the first two seasons will enjoy this one as well.",5,Still Going Strong,1280188800,"07 27, 2010",2010,2039,"['Breaking', 'Bad', 'best', 'serial', 'scripted', 'show', 'television', 'Season', '3', 'had', 'great', 'moments', 'continued', 'downward', 'spiral', 'shows', 'characters', 'even', 'realizing', 'seduction', 'money', 'root', 'most', 'evil', 'show', 'Excessive', 'pride', 'arrogance', 'other', 'major', 'culprit.While', 'was', 'good', 'season', 'show', 'become', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'little', 'top', 'parts', 'believability', 'factor', 'need', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'exciting', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'abandoned', 'realizm', 'was', 'heart', 'first', 'season', 'been', 'one', 'show', 'great', 'strengths', 'Spoilers', 'Walt', 'relationship', 'Jessie', 'nearing', 'skitzo', 'one', 'episodes', 'done', 'even', 'mocking', 'other', 'episodes', 'life', 'line', 'everything', 'worked', 'save', 'did', 'very', 'bad', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'do', 'help', 'other', 'season', 'killed', 'cold', 'blood', 'have', 'crossed', 'lines', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'uncrossed', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'Jessie', 'being', 'dumber', 'street', 'junkie', 'have', 'more', 'inherent', 'morality', 'then', 'Walt', 'when', 'down', 'it.The', 'personalities', 'politics', 'drug', 'trade', 'are', 'taking', 'tole', 'people', 'are', 'suffering', 'dying', ""'m"", 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'role', 'response', 'other', 'family', 'will', 'have', 'when', 'learn', 'truth', 'Walt', 'money', 'especially', 'Hank', 'Maria', 'now', 'have', 'unknowingly', 'benefitted', 'it.There', 'were', 'tense', 'moments', 'season', 'including', 'Hank', 'near', 'capture', 'Walt', 'Jessie', 'Hanks', 'blowout', 'Jessie', 'attack', 'Hank', 'Mexican', 'cartel', 'cousins', 'Not', 'forgetting', 'Jessie', 'showdown', 'drug', 'dealers', 'Walt', 'near', 'executions', ""'m"", 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'Season', '4', 'will', 'transpire', 'given', 'current', 'state', 'affairs', 'relationship', 'Walt', 'Gus', 'likely', 'only', 'get', 'worse', 'meaning', 'drastic', 'changes', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'made.If', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'will', 'enjoy', 'one', 'as', 'well']",N/A

BB has not lost its ability to surprise.  The show is raw, and not for all tastes, but for those who love edgy entertainment, this is YOUR show.  Bryan Cranston as the high school chem teacher turned meth dealer gamely earns his Emmys as he shows us the evolution of Wltr White from wimpy and mild to out and out badass...Cranston has emerged as a force to be reckoned with.  Aaron Paul, as his yong partner in crime, Jesse,finally received the recognition he deserves for his performance durin this season 3.  And Giancarlo Esposito has emerged as the most complex, subtle, and quietly menacing villain in television history.  Show creator Vince Gilligan, who earned his bones on 9 seasons of ""The X-Files"", has given us something truly special.  If you're anything like me, you are not terribly impressed with much of what is on network television.  I like my shows to bea little dangerous and to take creative risks.  Unlike its similar counterpart, Showtimes ""Weeds"" which has woefully worn out its welcome, Breaking Bad just keeps getting better.

1319308,A2XAQEGNXPIZ9P,B0032UYFA6,Honest Abe,"[2, 2]","This is one of the best dramas on television.  The writing is absolutely top notch!  While not all episodes are equally engrossing, the best of them are comparable to the best stuff ever written for the tube.  The HALF MEASURES episode in Season 3 is without question one of the most powerful dramatic hours I have ever seen on TV!  I found myself actually sitting there holding my breath throughout most of this hour.While Cranston and Paul together are flawless, I believe the real strength of this series is its terrific supporting cast!  Anna Gunn is one of the most interesting and convincing actresses (sorry, I mean actors) I had never seen before.  Dean Norris is simply marvelous as the driven, yet vulnerable, DEA agent, Hank Schrader.  Betsy Brandt is so convincing as Hank's supportive wife, Marie.  RJ Mitte is great as Walter's son, Walter Jr.; their relationship seeming so tender and genuine.  The very funny Bob Odenkirk here does a wonderful turn as Saul Goodman, one of the sleaziest lawyers you'd never want to meet.  But one of my favorite actors of all, whom I discovered while watching another great series many years ago, Homicide:Life On The Street, is the great Giancarlo Esposito, playing Gus Fring, a seemingly simple and quiet man, whom you soon learn you had best never make unhappy, in any way.  He plays his part with a quiet menace that won't let you take your eyes off him. Jonathan Banks plays Gus' right-hand man, Mike, an assistant who does Gus' bidding almost serenely, no matter what mayhem might be involved.But I would be badly remiss without mentioning some of the greatest cast choices ever, playing the various villains Walter and Jesse are forced to deal with at various times throughout this series.  Deserving of special mention, in my opinion, are from Season 1, Raymond Cruz as Tuco Salamanca, one of the most scarily insane criminal minds ever depicted on television! Right behind him would be the two silent but deadly killers from Season 3 known simply as ""The Cousins"", played by Luis and Daniel Moncada.  Their murder weapon of choice is a chrome plated fireman's ax.  Real sweethearts! Many of the smaller parts in this series are filled by some of the most convincing Hispanic actors working anywhere today.  And, lastly, I have to mention a real unsung star of this series and that is the city of Albuquerque itself.  None of the episodes in this series would be nearly as convincing had they been depicted in any other part of the country. Needless to say, I am eagerly awaiting July 17, the beginning of Season 4 for Breaking Bad.  Don't miss it!!!My only gripe, which I feel strongly I must mention, is a technical one, involving only the DVD production, itself.  How in the world can you put out a DVD in this day and age without including: ENGLISH CLOSED CAPTIONING FOR THE HARD OF HEARING!!??  Just inexcusable!  There is some dialogue in many of these episodes I still haven't been able to understand no matter how high I crank up the volume. Very, very disappointing!!!

Some things need to be said though about the way healthcare is portrayed.  Clearly, one message from the start of BB has been that the treatment you receive is based on ability to pay for services rendered.  If you don't actually work in this area, I suppose it makes sense to you.  I have 16+ years of experience in 6 different hospitals over that time period. I routinely see patients receive care that is unlikely to be paid for.  Also, it's common for those with little or no insurance to be subsidized by government programs, or the hospital itself. My hospital writes off millions in care every year. Someone in Walt's situation would not be expected to pay for chemotherapy, radiation treatment, etc. up front.  I have never seen that happen. I have seen a drug dealer spend a 9 month period in the hospital, after being shot by a rival.  Unlikely he'll pay one cent on his bills.  The fact is, those of us who work ""regular"" jobs subsidize those who don't.  The views expressed in the series are very inaccurate in my opinion. It's become popular to villify healthcare, and those of us who provide it, as greedy individuals focused exclusively on the bottom line. If it was possible for you to follow me on an average day at work, I would'nt have to tell you how true what I wrote above is.

The main protagonist &#8211; Walter White (played brilliantly by Bryan Cranston) &#8211; is still a bundle and a tangle of conflicting emotions and motives, while the other anti-hero Jesse Pinkman continues to rattle and annoy with his emotional instability.  What drives their relationship is an obvious mentor-student and father-son dynamic, and it&#8217;s become clear by the end of season three that no matter how much they loathe each other their destinies are bound together &#8211; and they will either sink or swim together.  By the end of season three, it&#8217;s become clear that their relationship is no longer unstable, and their partnership is now sealed in and by blood.There are two stunning achievements in season three.  The first achievement is the constant exploration and deepening of the character Hank Schrader, Walter White&#8217;s DEA brother-in-law.  It&#8217;s obvious that Hank and Walter are both headed into a penultimate epic battle, and I like the way that the show producers spend a lot of season three fully exploring and developing Hank&#8217;s character, and showing how behind his thick tough skin is a weak and frightened child who is nevertheless capable of exceptional heroism when the time arises.  Hank&#8217;s conflicting and confusing psychology makes him a coward in his own eyes, but it&#8217;s ultimately what redeems him and makes him sympathetic in ours.The final stunning achievement is the Gus character, Walter White&#8217;s doppelganger &#8211; his savior in season three, and who will be his arch-nemesis in seasons four and five.  Both are cautious and discreet man who are supremely proud of their caution and discretion.  But what differentiates the two is that Gus is someone who has wholehearted embrace evil while Walter is someone who dances with the evil in his own soul.  We are led to believe in season three that given the right circumstances and right time Walter can become the new Gus, and I suspect that season four is meant to dispel that thought in our heads.Gus is the face of evil, and it&#8217;s a theme that&#8217;s bound to blossom and reach full maturation in season four.

1319328,A1W98Q4MZK80VA,B0032UYFA6,Joseph P. Tevington,"[0, 0]","Stop now, if you are concerned about ""spoilers""....Though I recently watched all episodes of all four seasons in quick succession, I'd been left wondering where series creator Vince Gilligan was ultimately going and what sort of moral statement (if any), he was trying to make.  A NY Times piece has provided much insight:*""Walter White was a sympathetic innocent when AMC's descent-into-darkness television series, 'Breaking Bad,' began in 2008, a cancer-stricken chemistry teacher who -- ostensibly to support his family -- began to manufacture crystal meth....The premise of the series..., following Walter White's transformation from a decent man in desperate circumstances into a ruthless drug lord, always seemed made for a short run....what Mr. Gilligan wants before the series ends, is even more bleak: to remove all vestiges of likability from Walter White, to complete a transformation unlike anything a television series has ever tried....'I actively wanted to create a TV show in which the main character transformed from who he used to be into what he eventually will become. That's not how TV series are usually designed. The idea is to have your character remain pretty much who they are, sometimes for decades on end. I wasn't interested in doing that'....'All the characters bear the weight of their choices'....'This is not being dark just for the sake of being dark. These are people whose worlds are crashing in on top of them. It's heavy, heavy stuff'"" (Shattering All Vestiges of Innocence, NY Times, 7/15/11).There is apparently detailed research done for this show:* ""season three kicked off in March 2010 with a startling first season in which two ominous-looking cartel hit men...park their luxury car on a dusty dirt road and drop to the ground in their silk suits, joining the tens of villagers who are dragging themselves on all fours toward an adobe hut....the...assasins approach a life-size statue of Saint Death[sic], address her in prayer, and then affix a penciled sketch of Walt....and ask the skeleton saint[sic] to help them 'do justice'"" (Devoted to Death: Santa Muerte, the Skeleton Saint[sic], pp. 160-161).The above-described scene led to my reading ""Devoted to Death: Santa Muerte, the Skeleton Saint[sic],"" a poorly done work which seemed to infer that this ""devotion"" is an acceptable part of Catholicism.  A brief article by Michelle Martin seems to provide theological background for what Gilligan was attempting to portray:* ""Santa Muerte, translated 'Holy Death' or 'St. Death'....has become a favorite patron of narco traffickers carrying drugs across the Mexican-U.S. border, where shrines to her can be found along the roadsides. Many, if not most, of her followers call themselves Catholic.  But Santa Muerte is no saint. Saints, after all, are real people, not personifications of a universal experience, who are living with God in heaven, according to theCatechism of the Catholic Church. They can be intermediaries or intercessors with God....Santa Muerte, her followers believe, grants favors on her own, and not all of them are the sort of favors that people think God would approve of....Some people are willing to abandon Santa Muerte when they understand what she is, and is not. Others need more catechizing to understand why they cannot be good Catholics and offer prayers to death, the last enemy that Jesus defeated""(Our Lady of Guadalupe Battles ""Holy Death"" for Devotion of Mexican Faithful, Our Sunday Visitor Newsweekly, 2/19/12).Understanding what Gilligan is trying to convey, I believe that this show has the potential to convey the profound message that each of our moral choices shapes our characters: ""I actively wanted to create a TV show in which the main character transformed from who he used to be into what he eventually will become....All the characters bear the weight of their choices"" (Shattering All Vestiges of Innocence, NY Times, 7/15/11).",5,The Road to Perdition,1332633600,"03 25, 2012",2012,3928,"['Stop', 'now', 'are', 'concerned', 'spoilers', 'recently', 'watched', 'episodes', 'four', 'seasons', 'quick', 'succession', ""'d"", 'been', 'left', 'wondering', 'where', 'series', 'creator', 'Vince', 'Gilligan', 'was', 'ultimately', 'going', 'what', 'sort', 'moral', 'statement', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'NY', 'Times', 'piece', 'provided', 'much', 'insight', '*', 'Walter', 'White', 'was', 'sympathetic', 'innocent', 'when', 'AMC', 'descent-into-darkness', 'television', 'series', ""'Breaking"", 'Bad', 'began', '2008', 'cancer-stricken', 'chemistry', 'teacher', 'who', 'ostensibly', 'support', 'family', 'began', 'manufacture', 'crystal', 'meth', '.The', 'premise', 'series', 'following', 'Walter', 'White', 'transformation', 'decent', 'man', 'desperate', 'circumstances', 'ruthless', 'drug', 'lord', 'always', 'seemed', 'made', 'short', 'run', '.what', 'Mr.', 'Gilligan', 'series', 'even', 'more', 'bleak', 'remove', 'vestiges', 'likability', 'Walter', 'White', 'complete', 'transformation', 'anything', 'television', 'series', 'ever', 'tried', 'actively', 'wanted', 'create', 'TV', 'show', 'main', 'character', 'transformed', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'what', 'eventually', 'will', 'become', 'not', 'how', 'TV', 'series', 'are', 'usually', 'designed', 'idea', 'have', 'character', 'remain', 'pretty', 'much', 'who', 'are', 'sometimes', 'decades', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', 'doing', 'characters', 'bear', 'weight', 'choices', "".'This"", 'not', 'being', 'dark', 'just', 'sake', 'being', 'dark', 'are', 'people', 'worlds', 'are', 'crashing', 'top', 'heavy', 'heavy', 'stuff', 'Shattering', 'Vestiges', 'Innocence', 'NY', 'Times', '7/15/11', '.There', 'apparently', 'detailed', 'research', 'done', 'show', '*', 'season', 'three', 'kicked', 'off', 'March', '2010', 'startling', 'first', 'season', 'two', 'ominous-looking', 'cartel', 'hit', 'men', 'park', 'luxury', 'car', 'dusty', 'dirt', 'road', 'drop', 'ground', 'silk', 'suits', 'joining', 'tens', 'villagers', 'who', 'are', 'dragging', 'fours', 'adobe', 'hut', '.the', 'approach', 'life-size', 'statue', 'Saint', 'Death', '[', 'sic', ']', 'address', 'prayer', 'then', 'affix', 'penciled', 'sketch', 'Walt', '.and', 'ask', 'skeleton', 'saint', '[', 'sic', ']', 'help', ""'do"", 'justice', 'Devoted', 'Death', 'Santa', 'Muerte', 'Skeleton', 'Saint', '[', 'sic', ']', 'pp', '160-161', 'above-described', 'scene', 'led', 'reading', 'Devoted', 'Death', 'Santa', 'Muerte', 'Skeleton', 'Saint', '[', 'sic', ']', 'poorly', 'done', 'work', 'seemed', 'infer', 'devotion', 'acceptable', 'part', 'Catholicism', 'brief', 'article', 'Michelle', 'Martin', 'provide', 'theological', 'background', 'what', 'Gilligan', 'was', 'attempting', 'portray', '*', 'Santa', 'Muerte', 'translated', ""'Holy"", 'Death', 'Death', 'become', 'favorite', 'patron', 'narco', 'traffickers', 'carrying', 'drugs', 'Mexican-U.S.', 'border', 'where', 'shrines', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'roadsides', 'Many', 'not', 'most', 'followers', 'call', 'Catholic', 'Santa', 'Muerte', 'saint', 'Saints', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'not', 'personifications', 'universal', 'experience', 'who', 'are', 'living', 'God', 'heaven', 'according', 'theCatechism', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'can', 'be', 'intermediaries', 'intercessors', 'God', '.Santa', 'Muerte', 'followers', 'believe', 'grants', 'favors', 'own', 'not', 'are', 'sort', 'favors', 'people', 'think', 'God', 'would', 'approve', '.Some', 'people', 'are', 'willing', 'abandon', 'Santa', 'Muerte', 'when', 'understand', 'what', 'not', 'Others', 'need', 'more', 'catechizing', 'understand', 'why', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'Catholics', 'offer', 'prayers', 'death', 'last', 'enemy', 'Jesus', 'defeated', 'Lady', 'Guadalupe', 'Battles', 'Holy', 'Death', 'Devotion', 'Mexican', 'Faithful', 'Sunday', 'Visitor', 'Newsweekly', '2/19/12', '.Understanding', 'what', 'Gilligan', 'trying', 'convey', 'believe', 'show', 'potential', 'convey', 'profound', 'message', 'moral', 'choices', 'characters', 'actively', 'wanted', 'create', 'TV', 'show', 'main', 'character', 'transformed', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'what', 'eventually', 'will', 'become', 'characters', 'bear', 'weight', 'choices', 'Shattering', 'Vestiges', 'Innocence', 'NY', 'Times', '7/15/11']",N/A

This season we really get down and dirty with Walt going through his divorce and Skylar's anger causing her to react in all sorts of ways. I love the show mainly because it is about good people having to do bad things for different reasons. It makes the viewer really think. There are alot of grim moments this season, it is a grim show overall, always has been, but that is what makes it so genius. Season three is highly addictive and moves quickly with edge of your seat suspense in every epidode. There are never boring moments in Breaking Bad. Not only do we get to really get in Walt's mind, but Jesse gets a more pivotal role this season and I have to say I am glad. Jesse is one of my favorite characters and he has to makes hard decisions as so much is going on in his life. I find myself very drawn to Jesse's character and his turmoil. Walt is a sort of father figure to Jesse and something major happens that really shows the viewer what lengths Walt will go to for Jesse. How their relationship develops is touching at times and frustrating at others.  A new druglord is introduced which gives the show an overall tenseness and of course with Walt's brother in law's involvement it makes for some tense moments as well. The show is not light on violence and never sugarcoats what being a meth cooker would be like. There are all kinds of dilemmas and moral decisons to be considered. All in all it is a high octane season and every time the episode ends you just want more. I found myself crying throughout the procession of this season as there are alot of heavy circumstances. I love this show and can't wait until Season Four. The series finale leaves the viewer hanging so badly that I felt like screaming.

I was nervous that Breaking Bad would stray from what made it my favorite show of the past few years.And yet, season 3 has done it again...it was worth the wait, and I'm optimistic that season 3 will continue to live up to the high standards set in seasons 1 and 2.  Some new villains are introduced in episode 1, and Giancarlo Esposito is back in what seems could become a dangerous and pivotal role.I shut off cable a year ago, and get what TV I can for free through Hulu.

1319363,A2WYPTUQ7F16IH,B0032UYFA6,"Pinkyrose ""Pinky""","[0, 3]","Yes, I am a fan of Breaking Bad, however, there are major flaws in the story that just have to be addressed. Here are a few:l. Walt Jr. is far too cooperative for a 16 year old boy. When asked to do chores, he always says, &#34;Sure, Mom!&#34; like he is soooo happy. Most 16 year olds are sassy, self-centered, sleep all day-up all night, talk back, spend 99% of time with friends, NEVER do housework, and more. His grades would tank, too, if his dad was as much trouble as Walt Senior.2. Jesse's teeth are too perfect. A heavy meth user's teeth ground away with the constant use and gums are red, bloody, soft. Other users on the show have bad teeth, but not Jesse. NOT believeable.3. There is hardly any mention of DNA. At all murder scenes in which Walt just walks away, his DNA would be everywhere. BOTH their DNA and fingerprints were all over Uncle Tio's house--case over.4. At Tio's when Tuko throws Jesse and Walt's phones into the back yard, police would have found them, found their fingerprints and case over.5. Jesse is not that attractive that super hot chicks would be after him. The actresses chosen to play his love interests are way too pretty for a guy who is a big loser. They are also too tall and too big for him. He seems overpowered by them.6. The theft of lab equipment would have been noticed. Other teachers would have complained that things were missing. Schools keep up with stuff better than that. Each teacher uses the equipment, so someone would have noticed. There is always a bitchy woman on the staff who keeps up with stuff right down to pencils and erasers.7. No one ever seems to be looking out a window to see murders and kidnappings. Just not realistic.8. Mike would have immediately killed Walt when Walt killed Gus. Mike would know he had to get to Walt before Walt got to him.9. Killing 9 in prisons? Come on!! Prisons have cameras everywhere. Someone would have seen something. NOT believeable.10. When Hank was driving by the laundry, he would have seen Walt's car. We cannot believe that a skilled detective would rely on one person to drive him by that place only one time. He would have driven by at all hours of the day and night.11. Walt would have spent his money all along for basic household needs. They were barely getting by, so he would have been buying groceries, new shoes for Walt, Jr., baby clothes, gas, etc. He would have always had a pocket full of cash, to make Skyler's life smoother. She would have liked that and he could have eased her along better.12. Why did Walt make a pass at the principal? Does not make sense for him logically. We are to believe he does all things out of logic. This would only harm him.13. We are told over and over how he does this for his family. All right-----we get it. You do not have to remind us....enough already.14. Jesse throwing money away would not happen. He would be doing his best to show that he is a winner to his parents. He would have been buying things for his parents, sending his mom flowers on all occasions, and spending the cash on the girlfriends for diamonds, clothes, etc.15. Jesse would not drive a beat up car. He would have a Lexus or Mercedes. All drug dealers drive the best cars in town. The local car dealers rely on them to spend their cash and everyone turns a blind eye.16. Someone with the DEA would be on Walt and Jesse's side. The money is just too much of a temptation. They could have paid off their own informant.17. Jesse and Walt's DNA would be in the UHaul Truck that did the magnet thing. The magnets would get traced back to the junk yard and case closed.18. All junk yards have to give account for cars that are smashed. Even though they got rid of the RV, there would be enough left for DNA, even fingerprints. Case closed at that point.19. Someone would notice that Walt was visiting Jesse in the hospital. Case closed.20. The mask found in the desert would have had fingerprints or DNA from Walt. Case closed. It did lead them back to the school. DEA would have put in cameras and found Walt stealing more property. Most schools have cameras inside anyway. Case closed.21. Once Walt gets all that money, women would be after him.22. There are not enough female characters in this show. Women are always around where money is being made. Walt would have been tempted with plenty of 15 to 20 year olds. Hot chicks can sniff out cash.23. Walt would have been using cough drops with all that coughing.24. There is a mouth wash that cancer doctors prescribe for lung patients because of the dry mouth and odors. Walt would constantly be using mouthwash and cough drops.25. NO one with lung disease can run up and down steps. He would be on oxygen therapy with the air tanks needed at all times. Uncle Tio has them and he is sitting. Walt would not be that active with real lung cancer. Lungs determine all movement of the body. He would not be able to move like he does. Even driving a car is difficult with lung cancer and chemo.26. Nothing is said about the raids on Gus's delivery trucks. Law enforcement would have been involved, this would lead to Gus; case over.27. Ted would not be all goo goo over a 40 year old pregnant woman. He would have a long line of 20 year olds in his bed.28. Once Skylar found problems with Ted's books, he would have fired her. Men do not like bad news.29. They can pay $800,000 for a car wash????? How is that money laundering????30. Walt would have been traveling to the Caymen islands or other sites that will launder money for him. He could afford to hire a private plane.31. Walt would have an alternate plan of escape. With 80 million he would have many options.32. He would have been sending the family on long vacations, as in Europe or Australia. People with new money travel. He would keep them out of town and out of his way and out of harm.33. Most people who live in the West do speak Spanish. A person with Walt's intelligence would pick it up easily.34. Walt would buy diamonds and expensive shoes for Skylar. Woman can be bought off. Logically, he would appeal to her ego. As Ron White says, &#34;Diamonds, that will shut her up.&#34;35. The baby does not seem to grow very fast. Most children will not fit into a bassinet at age 6 to 9 months. Is that a real baby? Looks fake. Why is it always wearing a hat? In New Mexicto with heat in the 100's to 110's?36. Skylar would have followed Walt to the laundry. case closed.37. Friends of Crazy 8 would have gone to see Jesse as he was last seen with him.38. The police are portrayed as bunbling fools. Not so. They are generally very thorough. Not believeable that no police officer can put two and two together.39. There would have been a police report filed when Walt crashed the new car he bought for Walt Jr. No one gets away with that kind of damage without someone noticing. case closed40. Hank has plenty of chances to bug Walt's home or car. He would have in order to find out the truth, then, he could have built his case.41. Gus's operation was way to big for him to rely on one person to cook. He would have had cooks all over the place. He could have set up labs in his trucks. He was too smart to put all his eggs in one basket.42. Tio would not pee in a pool in front of the Don--never happen. Pee on flowers or people, but not the pool where gals are gonna be swimming.43. Walt Jr. never changes. A kid at age 16 changes in many ways. His hair style is not modern. His clothes are like circa 1995.44. Jesse's shirts never get dirty. The white stays the whitest. He sleeps in clothes, but they do not wrinkle and he does not smell. Not believeable.45. Hospitals film all visitors. Hank would have reviewed the tapes to see who was visiting Jesse. case closed46. Too many dead bodies and no one seems to be missing them. Too many ways both Walt and Jesse would have been seen with the ones they killed. All cities have cameras on the streets. All major roads have &#34;eye in the sky&#34; cameras. When people die, relatives know who the last person is that was with them.47. All in all, too many things just are not believeable. Police are not that bad at their jobs and criminals are not that lucky.",5,Flaws with Breaking Bad,1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,8154,"['Yes', 'am', 'fan', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'however', 'are',

1319364,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B0032UYFA6,"Promise ""promise""","[0, 0]","I'd like to award this three and a half stars, signifying something in between ""I'ts OK"" and ""I like it.""  I am one of many who loved the First Season, was disappointed in the Second one but who has continued to watch it.  It IS addictive!I don't think Season Three matches the quality of Season One but it's no worse than the second one. I found the initial premise of the mild-mannered Walter Mitty type science teacher, hen-pecked by his wife, cheated out of his fair share of his research by Eliot, the hyper-successful entrepreneur, finally coming into his own power to be a wonderful idea.  It's sort of a modern day Odyssey in my opinion.  And it worked really well as a black comedy, especially in the opening shows which were often hilarious.By Season Two Walt is feeling his oats and he's a little less interesting and less likable.  By Season Three I find him to be often annoying, as in ""The Fly.""  Egad!  We are given some relief when he shows his heroism in positive ways, like by saving Jesse.  And then we are shown the ""cute"" moments when he cuddles his baby girl.  I've read that the intention of the writer was to show Walt's shift from a good guy to a bad guy.  And this is what has happened.  I would prefer a more heroic journey...from a powerless wimp to a stong hero who uses his power for good.  But they didn't ask my opinion and I guess that was already done in Superman.Anyway I am addicted and I have continued to watch it in spite of my objections.  There are some nice moments.  I like the lawyer (I live in New Mexico and there ia some business that hires a guy to dress up as the Statue of Libery and wave to people in the street....I'm suprised Saul hasn't done that yet.  Anyway I have to laugh every time I see the statue on his roof.  I also like that little lock of hair that comes down on his forhead...very cute.  It's details like this that are delightful, especially for us locals who know the scene....like Blake's Lottaburgers and the Georgia O'Keefe vagina paintings.  I like Chicken Man, too---he's an original and a break from the usualM Mexican drug thug types. I also loved ""Gale"" the Libertarian chemist with the very good taste in home furnishings!  Ha!  The scene of him singing along to some  obscure Spanish language song was priceless.  I also appreciated the appearance of Jesse's old pals at the 12 seep progrma, especially outside when one said he was alrady on the sixth step!Some of the story lines that were started in earlier seasons were dropped and I wonder if they'll be picked up later---Marie's shoplifting habit and Skyler's helping Ted's cooking the books.  I'd like to see these picked up later...especially all they both involve law breaking.  Marie is also much more interesting in her ditzy mode than in her serious wife mode.The most interesting feature of the series to me is the relationship of Jesse and Walt.  We can see that Jesse needs a good dad and I had to wonder at first why Walt seemed to take such a fatherly interest in Jesse, given that he has a son.  Then I realized that Walt Jr. (aka Flyn) looks up to his DEA Uncle Hank as a role model....which leaves Walt needing a son. I know that's kind of a stretch but it does provide some credibility for his feelings towards Jesse.The ratio between gang related violence and human interactions is still too much loaded for violence for my taste.  And I would like to have more reason for rooting for Walt, since he has become such a prick at times.  It's funny that I don't mind his violent acts as much as I cringe at the way he harps at poor Jesse.I add that I saw this in one fell swoop on Netflix.  I don't know if that affects my opinion of the show or not.  I do know that myy eyes are tired.  But after a break I'll move on to Season Four, hoping for the best.",3,Still holding strong,1376784000,"08 18, 2013",2013,3801,"[""'d"", 'like', 'award', 'three', 'half', 'stars', 'signifying', 'something', ""I'ts"", 'OK', 'like', 'am', 'one', 'many', 'who', 'loved', 'First', 'Season', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Second', 'one', 'who', 'continued', 'watch', 'addictive', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Season', 'Three', 'quality', 'Season', 'One', 'worse', 'second', 'one', 'found', 'initial', 'premise', 'mild-mannered', 'Walter', 'Mitty', 'type', 'science', 'teacher', 'hen-pecked', 'wife', 'cheated', 'fair', 'share', 'research', 'Eliot', 'hyper-successful', 'entrepreneur', 'finally', 'coming', 'own', 'power', 'be', 'wonderful', 'idea', 'sort', 'modern', 'day', 'Odyssey', 'opinion', 'worked', 'really', 'well', 'black', 'comedy', 'especially', 'opening', 'shows', 'were', 'often', 'hilarious.By', 'Season', 'Two', 'Walt', 'feeling', 'oats', 'little', 'less', 'interesting', 'less', 'likable', 'Season', 'Three', 'find', 'be', 'often', 'annoying', 'Fly', 'Egad', 'are', 'given', 'relief', 'when', 'heroism', 'positive', 'ways', 'saving', 'Jesse', 'then', 'are', 'shown', 'cute', 'moments', 'when', 'baby', 'girl', ""'ve"", 'read', 'intention', 'writer', 'was', 'show', 'Walt', 'shift', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'happened', 'would', 'prefer', 'more', 'heroic', 'journey', 'powerless', 'wimp', 'stong', 'hero', 'who', 'power', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'ask', 'opinion', 'guess', 'was', 'already', 'done', 'Superman.Anyway', 'am', 'addicted', 'have', 'continued', 'watch', 'spite', 'objections', 'are', 'nice', 'moments', 'lawyer', 'live', 'New', 'Mexico', 'ia', 'business', 'guy', 'dress', 'up', 'Statue', 'Libery', 'wave', 'people', 'street', '.I', ""'m"", 'suprised', 'Saul', ""n't"", 'done', 'yet', 'Anyway', 'have', 'laugh', 'time', 'see', 'statue', 'roof', 'also', 'little', 'lock', 'hair', 'down', 'forhead', 'very', 'cute', 'details', 'are', 'delightful', 'especially', 'locals', 'who', 'know', 'scene', '.like', 'Blake', 'Lottaburgers', 'Georgia', ""O'Keefe"", 'vagina', 'paintings', 'like', 'Chicken', 'Man', 'too', '-he', 'original', 'break', 'usualM', 'Mexican', 'drug', 'thug', 'types', 'also', 'loved', 'Gale', 'Libertarian', 'chemist', 'very', 'good', 'taste', 'home', 'furnishings', 'Ha', 'scene', 'singing', 'along', 'obscure', 'Spanish', 'language', 'song', 'was', 'priceless', 'also', 'appreciated', 'appearance', 'Jesse', 'old', 'pals', '12', 'seep', 'progrma', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'said', 'was', 'alrady', 'sixth', 'step', 'story', 'lines', 'were', 'started', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'were', 'dropped', 'wonder', ""'ll"", 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'later', '-Marie', 'shoplifting', 'habit', 'Skyler', 'helping', 'Ted', 'cooking', 'books', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'picked', 'up', 'later', 'especially', 'involve', 'law', 'breaking', 'Marie', 'also', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'ditzy', 'mode', 'serious', 'wife', 'most', 'interesting', 'feature', 'series', 'relationship', 'Jesse', 'Walt', 'can', 'see', 'Jesse', 'good', 'dad', 'had', 'wonder', 'first', 'why', 'Walt', 'seemed', 'take', 'fatherly', 'interest', 'Jesse', 'given', 'son', 'Then', 'realized', 'Walt', 'Jr.', 'aka', 'Flyn', 'up', 'DEA', 'Uncle', 'Hank', 'role', 'model', '.which', 'Walt', 'needing', 'son', 'know', 'kind', 'stretch', 'provide', 'credibility', 'feelings', 'Jesse.The', 'ratio', 'gang', 'related', 'violence', 'human', 'interactions', 'still', 'too', 'much', 'loaded', 'violence', 'taste', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'more', 'reason', 'rooting', 'Walt', 'become', 'prick', 'times', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'violent', 'acts', 'as', 'much', 'cringe', 'way', 'poor', 'Jesse.I', 'add', 'saw', 'one', 'fell', 'swoop', 'Netflix', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'opinion', 'show', 'not', 'do', 'know', 'myy', 'eyes', 'are', 'tired', 'break', ""'ll"", 'move', 'Season', 'Four', 'hoping', 'best']",N/A

The drama, both crime and family, is portrayed excellently. There is a nice blend of dark and light humor. The action and tension keeps you addicted and craving more. Then there are equal parts of character development and exploration that add a nice depth to the mix. Add all those elements together and they have found the perfect formula for this series. It really earns it's reputation as one of television's greatest series (filling a specific void that has been lingering since series like The Sopranos, The Shield and The Wire left our screens). This season is great and Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul show how they earned their respective 2010 Best Lead/Supporting Actor Emmy Awards. Their pairing and subsequent chemistry are what binds this series together.The third season consists of the following thirteen episodes, three of which were censored during original air and are found uncensored here:1 No Mas2 Caballo Sin Nombre3 I.F.T. (*Uncensored Version)4 Green Light5 Mas (*Uncensored Version)6 Sunset7 One Minute8 I See You9 Kafkaesque10 Fly (*Uncensored Version)11 Abiquiu12 Half Measures13 Full MeasuresThis season is amazingly crafted. It begins by picking up where last season's cliffhanger left off. Walt is dealing with some guilt and Jesse has demons of his own to overcome. From there it is a slow burn for a few episodes as things are put in place for the middle of the season. Around episodes 6, 7 and 8 things kick into a high gear that finds the series being magnificently entertaining. After that the series does some character exploration and storytelling as it all starts coming together for another season finale cliffhanger where everything comes down to the last minute. Those who've seen it know it is a wonderfully structured season and those who haven't seen it yet are in for a treat.Special Features:-Cast & Crew Commentaries on 9 Episodes (By Vince Gilligan, Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Betsy Brandt, Dean Norris, Bob Odenkirk, Jonathan Banks and more)-5 Behind-the-scenes Featurettes: Hit and Run, The Music of Breaking Bad, White Heat: Cranston on Fire, Pizza of Destiny: Cranston's Greatest Shot, Silent But Deadly: The Brothers Moncada-Outtakes-Deleted Scenes and Unused Footage-Team S.C.I.E.N.C.E.

While I love Mad Men and those sets reveal a lot of information in their commentaries they are nowhere near the Breaking Bad sets when it comes to behind-the-scenes. This Breaking Bad set not only has commentaries but like the first two sets it has a lot of supplemental material that gives viewers a real look into the making of the series. The Breaking Bad sets are, in my opinion, the best television series sets you can buy for your money.The other thing about Breaking Bad is that it has it's own unique niche. There are other great series on television, arguably Mad Men and Boardwalk Empire among others, but Breaking Bad has something all its own. It doesn't have a period setting, it doesn't have any supernatural elements such as vampires or zombies, it is set in a modern day reality. While those other things are fun, Breaking Bad is a refreshing series that doesn't have to pay service to anything other than its story. This means that it is always attemping to tell its story in unique and interesting ways. They are always trying to break new ground and push the envelope in every way. The directing, the music selection, the writing/storytelling, every single element of this series tries to do something new or original and it is quite apparent when watching any of the episodes.I should note I own the first two seasons on Blu-ray and they look great, but I've also seen them on DVD and they still look pretty darn good, so DVD buyer's won't be missing much (not even in regards to features). That said I'll definitely being going all in for the third time and getting the 3-disc Blu-ray. I've been having withdrawal symptoms since the last season ended, I can't wait to buy this and get psyched up for season 4!!!

1319372,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0032UYFA6,RMurray847,"[298, 308]","After 3 years of BREAKING BAD, I'm still amazed and bemused that I've grown to care so very much about a meth manufacturer and his messed-up, addictive young assistant.  In Season One, Walter White (Bryan Cranston, in one of the best performances of the decade) was a mild-mannered high school science teacher who finds out he's likely dying of cancer, and uses his knowledge of chemistry to concoct a really excellent form of meth.  He turns to a former student and druggie, Jesse (Aaron Paul, in one of the other great performances of the decade) to help him sell the stuff.  The two form an awkward bond, punctuated by nearly comedic moments when their ineptitude causes endless trouble for them.  Walt struggles to hide his double life from his wife Skylar, his sickly teenage son and his brother-in-law Hank, who happens to be a DEA agent.In Season Two, the success of Walt's meth draws unwanted attention from various law enforcement types, as well as those on the wrong side of the law.  Walt's secret becomes harder to hide, and Jesse and Walt grow estranged as several bad turns force a wedge between them.  Jesse falls in love, but he and his girl, a recovering addict, don't exactly help each other out.  Walt & Jesse are further ""assisted"" by a new attorney (Bob Odenkirk, offering probably the only comic relief to be found anymore) who tried hard to help these two launder their money.  The season ends badly, with tragedies both personal and widespread...and Walt's marriage is in shambles.Season 3 introduces us to a new Walt, one that has been evolving since the beginning.  He's now a hardened criminal, still showing his mild-mannered side...but also fully turned over to his darkness.  In Season Two, he committed a couple of acts that were so horrific that he can no longer really look himself in the mirror and see the ""good guy"" he once was.  He partners with a local drug kingpin (wonderfully played by Giancarlo Esposito) and begins to manufacture on a scale he had scarcely imagined possible.  Jesse struggles with loss and addiction, and it's a long time before these two old partners come together again.There are many wonderful things about the show and Season 3.  First, the character evolution is better than on almost any other show on TV.  You can actually track the changes to these folks in a way that makes you realize that most other TV characters basically remain unchangeable.  You see that Walt has become a crafty ""bad"" guy...he has truly broken bad.  His wife has evolved.  His son.  Hank.  And poor Jesse.  They hardly resemble the characters we first met...and time has not been kind to any of them.  And with the excellent writing, directing and acting...we can practically feel the guild and corruption pouring off of them.The show introduces some great new characters, and develops Esposito & Odenkirk to a great extent.  I particularly enjoyed the two hit men from south of the border.  These two cousins are vicious killers who never speak a word...and you'd be hard-pressed to find two creepier characters in recent TV history.  They are introduced in the squirm-inducing first scene of the season...setting you up perfectly to be on edge for just about anything all year.  Midway through the season, Hank and these two cousins have a brief scene together that is easily among the most exciting, tense, jaw-dropping few minutes in television history.  I rarely find myself needing to yell at the television and the characters on it...but any viewer of BREAKING BAD will be hard-pressed not to jump up and down and yell.  That five minutes alone make the season worthwhile...it's almost like the final 6 minutes of SIX FEET UNDER made watching that whole series worthwhile.I really don't want to spoil anything, but suffice it to say that Walt and Jesse are headed to some very dark places.  Walt has few redeeming qualities left to him...but his concern for the moral life of Jesse is one very touching quality he retains.  Because he feels so irredeemably corrupted himself, he ""runs interference"" against some of Jesse's self-destructive tendencies.  And near the end, when that concern is also twisted by fate and circumstance...it becomes almost unbearable for the viewer.  When was the last time you sat on the edge of your seat over a MORAL DILEMMA?!?!The quality of this show is nearly unsurpassed.  It is very thoroughly only for adults though.  There is almost no behavior to admire.  It is brutal and blunt and gritty.  (It also uses Albuquerque, my town, VERY well...which gives me an extra dose of love for the show.  We see real locations, real local restaurants, even real local pizza carryout joints.)  But it is so tightly constructed from both a plot and character standpoint that it provides intelligent, gripping entertainment.  And the work of Aaron Paul, and particularly Bryan Cranston, is so superb that any appreciator of fine acting really should tune in.If you haven't seen the show before, PLEASE go back and start from the beginning.  It truly has been like one long journey, and it begs to be appreciated from its starting point.  But for heaven's sake, SEE IT!",5,A great season in one of TV's finest shows.,1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,5140,"['3', 'years', 'BREAKING', 'BAD', ""'m"", 'still', 'amazed', 'bemused', ""'ve"",

I started watching it by accident and was immediately hooked, told my parents about it, and now they are huge fans as well. Bryan Cranston has won two Emmys for his acting in the show and it is totally deserved. Watching Cranston take the character of Walter White and slowly, convincingly transform him from a mild mannered high school teacher to a drug dealer and outlaw is to be in awe of Cranston's remarkable talent.  Aaron Paul, as  Walter's ""assistant"" Jesse, is just as good, just as nuanced and complicated,and far more sympathetic.Every character in the series is well crafted and believable and the writing is excellent. Because the story line evolves around illegal drug manufacturing and dealing, there is a fair amount of screen time given to outlaw behavior, including violence. This series is not for the faint of heart or the squeamish-some of the violence is horrific and a startling reminder of just how vicious the underworld of drug trafficing can be. The plots are ingenious, however, and  viewers are constantly asking themselves ""How are they going to get out of this one??!"" This is top-notch, edge-of-your-seat TV programming.

1319382,A3I8FT707XKQAJ,B0032UYFA6,Sam Quixote,"[1, 1]","What to say about Season 3 without giving away important plot points? Well... Walt and Skyler's marriage is in trouble, Hank's search for the elusive Heizenburg draws ever closer, Walt and Jesse's setup changes, and there is a hell of lot that Walt and Jesse do that you would never have thought they would have done having seen Season 1 and 2.I thought the series started off slowly with the early episodes focusing of Walt and Skyler a bit melodramatic, like soap opera schtick. Then the aftermath of the ending of Season 2 and how the town deals with it was a bit overblown as well. But then the series picks up as Walt and Jesse's chickens come home to roost. A couple of badass Mexican assassins are coming to town and it's these guys combined with Walt's benefactor and Hank that really helps the series find 5th gear midway through the series. I watched maybe four episodes in one go and it blew me away, best movie I've seen all year!In the aftermath of the carnage that happens mid season, things develop even more interestingly for Walt as the situation he finds himself in starts to slowly turn on him. It's always been the case that Walt and Jesse's good things often go bad quickly and it's the case here - only for them it causes them to act more desperately than ever before. And the ending? Everything leading up to it made me wonder how Walt and Jesse were going to survive going head to head with the cartels but this was one hell of an unexpected, gutsy ending.The writing throughout is utterly brilliant, full credit to Vince Gilligan and his team for knocking it out of the park even in the less explosive episodes (of which there are maybe 4 out of the 13). It's always witty, clever, and the twists and turns always imaginative and unexpected. Fantastic, wonderful writing, maybe the best seen on TV since ""The Wire"".And the acting - well, both Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul earned Emmys for their performances in this series and let me say that they both deserved it. Aaron Paul's work in Series 2 was enough for the trophy but he was finally recognised with his work in Series 3. Gilligan and co. give him some excellent speeches to make, especially when Jesse is physically impaired in some of the middle episodes, and Jesse's character becomes more and more interesting with each passing show.And Bryan Cranston, man this guy can do it all can't he? Walter White goes to some dark places in this series and at every step Cranston is able to make you watch him in every scene without having you take your eyes off of him - he is an actor who takes a scene and turns it into an acting masterclass. Despite all of the darkness in this series there are moments of levity that are really funny because Cranston and Paul have this excellent chemistry (pun intended) and great timing.Dean Norris who plays Hank the DEA brother in law also knocks it out of the park. His character is given some very difficult and some very human situations and Norris is completely believable throughout. I always liked Hank up to this point but now he becomes more than the loud mouthed indestructible wall of confidence he's been up to now and develops further. Excellent work as well from Anna Gunn, Bob Odenkirk (the deliciously seedy lawyer), and the two ""baddies"" Giancarlo Esposito (who brings an intensity to every scene like you won't believe - you watch his face during his scenes and that work alone deserves an Emmy) and Jonathan Banks, the badder than badass enforcer.If you're reading this then you're a fan and wondering if Season 3 holds up to Season 1 and 2 - well let me assure you it does. I would say as a whole it's not as perfect as Season 2 was, but there's too much outstanding work in Season 3 to say it's nothing short of an excellent continuation of the best TV series at the moment. It's too watchable, and though it started slow (for me), once it got going, it got going GOOD, and though I tried to space it out with 1 episode a night, I ended up watching the last 8 in 2 sittings. This is the best TV show out there and puts to shame most everything else that calls itself ""drama"". Cannot wait for Season 4.

1319383,A73QPH7NGI0DJ,B0032UYFA6,Sean Curley,"[2, 3]","""Breaking Bad"", along with ""Mad Men"", ushered in a revolution at the AMC network, which suddenly found itself with two of the most acclaimed drama series on television.  This third season of ""Breaking Bad"" continues this tradition of excellence, once again putting Walter White (Bryan Cranston, who collected his third Emmy for his work this year; though hopefully his absence from this year's Emmys will open doors for his network colleague Jon Hamm) and Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul, who collected his first Emmy for this year) up to their necks in trouble.  Spoilers follow.Season Two ended with Walter having beaten back cancer (for now) and achieved the money he needs to look after his family, at the cost of his family after his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn, superb, but perennially overlooked compared to her costars) discovered his lies and illegal activities.  Meanwhile, Jesse, who lost his girlfriend Jane to a tragic drug overdose, has gotten clean - unfortunately, while this leads to his realizing that he is the ""bad guy"", that only leads to him embracing criminality anew, with his eyes wide open.  Both men end up in business with Gus (Giancarlo Esposito), a methodical drug kingpin who conceals his dealings behind the front of a restaurant chain.  The fracturing of both Walt's family and his relationship with Jesse provides the dramatic impetus for the season as it advances.  Meanwhile, past sins come back to haunt Walt, and, despite Skyler's initial rejection of Walt, she finds herself increasingly drawn into the ""family"" business.""Breaking Bad"" is notable for its moral complexity, casting its protagonists as tremendously flawed individuals capable of great illegality and motivated by both supreme necessity and supreme egotism.  The two leads are superb and deserving of all their accolades, but the supporting cast is equally capable.  Dean Norris as Walt's DEA agent brother-in-law gets a considerable showcase for his talent this year.  Conversely, I'm always waiting for the show to really do something with Walter Jr. (R. J. Mitte).  Esposito makes a superb addition to the cast as the ice-cold drug lord, and one hopes he will continue to be a presence in the show for some time to come (though based on where season three ends, that may not be possible).Highly recommended.",5,"""Breaking Bad"" continues at the top of its game.",1310601600,"07 14, 2011",2011,2302,"['Breaking', 'Bad', 'Mad', 'Men', 'ushered', 'revolution', 'AMC', 'network', 'suddenly', 'found', 'two', 'most', 'acclaimed', 'drama', 'series', 'television', 'third', 'season', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'tradition', 'excellence', 'once', 'again', 'putting', 'Walter', 'White', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'who', 'collected', 'third', 'Emmy', 'work', 'year', 'hopefully', 'absence', 'year', 'Emmys', 'will', 'open', 'doors', 'network', 'colleague', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'Jesse', 'Pinkman', 'Aaron', 'Paul', 'who', 'collected', 'first', 'Emmy', 'year', 'necks', 'trouble', 'Spoilers', 'follow.Season', 'Two', 'ended', 'Walter', 'having', 'beaten', 'back', 'cancer', 'now', 'achieved', 'money', 'look', 'family', 'cost', 'family', 'wife', 'Skyler', 'Anna', 'Gunn', 'superb', 'perennially', 'overlooked', 'compared', 'costars', 'discovered', 'lies', 'illegal', 'activities', 'Meanwhile', 'Jesse', 'who', 'lost', 'girlfriend', 'Jane', 'tragic', 'drug', 'overdose', 'gotten', 'clean', 'unfortunately', 'realizing', 'bad', 'guy', 'only', 'embracing', 'criminality', 'anew', 'eyes', 'wide', 'open', 'men', 'end', 'up', 'business', 'Gus', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'methodical', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'who', 'conceals', 'dealings', 'front', 'restaurant', 'chain', 'fracturing', 'Walt', 'family', 'relationship', 'Jesse', 'dramatic', 'impetus', 'season', 'Meanwhile', 'past', 'sins', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'Walt', 'Skyler', 'initial', 'rejection', 'Walt', 'increasingly', 'drawn', 'family', 'business', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'notable', 'moral', 'complexity', 'casting', 'protagonists', 'tremendously', 'flawed', 'individuals', 'capable', 'great', 'illegality', 'motivated', 'supreme', 'necessity', 'supreme', 'egotism', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'superb', 'deserving', 'accolades', 'supporting', 'cast', 'equally', 'capable', 'Dean', 'Norris', 'Walt', 'DEA', 'agent', 'brother-in-law', 'considerable', 'showcase', 'talent', 'year', 'Conversely', ""'m"", 'always', 'waiting', 'show', 'really', 'do', 'something', 'Walter', 'Jr.', 'R.', 'J.', 'Mitte', 'Esposito', 'superb', 'addition', 'cast', 'ice-cold', 'drug', 'lord', 'one', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'presence', 'show', 'time', 'come', 'based', 'where', 'season', 'three', 'ends', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'possible', '.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

1319387,A3UI6CTFWL721L,B0032UYFA6,"S. Naimpally ""avid music and movie fan""","[1, 4]","The premise of Breaking Bad is very intriguing.  You have a guy, Walt, who was very bright and has a PhD in Chemistry reduced to teaching high school classes. Meanwhile, the people that he graduated with started a company, based on his PhD thesis, and are millionaires.  His brother-in-law is a DEA agent and so he witnesses just how much money is involved in the sale of drugs, such as crystal meth.  During a ride-along with his brother-in-law, he discovers that one of his former students, a high school dropout, is in fact a well known meth cooker called Capn Cook.  When Walt discovers he has cancer and that his insurance won't cover the cost of treatment, he teams up with Capn Cook to cook meth to pay for his cancer treatments and to provide for his family.  So here is this person who could be anyone of us, leading a double life, as a mild mannered high school teacher, father, and husband and also as a drug dealer.The entire cast is superb and the acting is top notch.  In terms of character development, the writing is excellent.  Each character has his or her own quirks/flaws.  For example, Walt's sister-in-law, the wife of the DEA agent, is a kleptomaniac.  Walt's wife likes to smoke, even though she is pregnant and knows she shouldn't.  Walt's brother-in-law, the DEA agent, is outwardly tough, but is prone to anxiety attacks based on the horrific things that he has witnessed.  Many of the flaws are shown in a way that is funny yet tragic.  The writing maintains a very sly sense of humor, which serves to lighten the very serious topics of cancer and drugs.My main problem with the writing is plot development.  I found many situations that characters were placed in to be highly contrived, and not in keeping with the character's personality.  For example, one of Capn Cook's cousins, called Badger, is recruited to sell meth.  He meets up with a potential client and despite being portrayed as a dullard, he correctly deduces that the potential client is an undercover police officer.  Despite this, he sells the meth to the police officer and immediately gets busted.  Unfortunately, the plot is full of situations like this, where the characters make stupid choices or choices that are out of character.  These situations are created to advance the plot by placing the characters in new situations, but considering how great the character development is, I found the plot development to lack any subtlety.  The characters could be placed into the same situations with more finesse and without resorting to having the characters make stupid choices or choices that are out of character.  After a while, I found myself losing interest in the series because of constantly seeing the characters make stupid choices, though the character had already been shown to be smarter than that.My actual rank is 3.5 stars, which I have rounded up to four.  If you can overlook the glaring holes in the plot development, the rest of the show is quite engrossing.",4,Superb acting from ensemble cast but writing could be better,1323216000,"12 7, 2011",2011,2976,"['premise', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'very', 'intriguing', 'have', 'guy', 'Walt', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'bright', 'PhD', 'Chemistry', 'reduced', 'teaching', 'high', 'school', 'classes', 'Meanwhile', 'people', 'graduated', 'started', 'company', 'based', 'PhD', 'thesis', 'are', 'millionaires', 'brother-in-law', 'DEA', 'agent', 'so', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'involved', 'sale', 'drugs', 'such', 'crystal', 'meth', 'ride-along', 'brother-in-law', 'one', 'former', 'students', 'high', 'school', 'dropout', 'fact', 'well', 'known', 'meth', 'cooker', 'called', 'Capn', 'Cook', 'When', 'Walt', 'cancer', 'insurance', 'wo', ""n't"", 'cover', 'cost', 'treatment', 'up', 'Capn', 'Cook', 'cook', 'meth', 'pay', 'cancer', 'treatments', 'provide', 'family', 'So', 'here', 'person', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'anyone', 'leading', 'double', 'life', 'mild', 'mannered', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'father', 'husband', 'also', 'drug', 'dealer.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'superb', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'terms', 'character', 'development', 'writing', 'excellent', 'character', 'own', 'quirks/flaws', 'example', 'Walt', 'sister-in-law', 'wife', 'DEA', 'agent', 'kleptomaniac', 'Walt', 'wife', 'smoke', 'even', 'pregnant', 'should', ""n't"", 'Walt', 'brother-in-law', 'DEA', 'agent', 'outwardly', 'tough', 'prone', 'anxiety', 'attacks', 'based', 'horrific', 'things', 'witnessed', 'Many', 'flaws', 'are', 'shown', 'way', 'funny', 'yet', 'tragic', 'writing', 'very', 'sly', 'sense', 'humor', 'lighten', 'very', 'serious', 'topics', 'cancer', 'drugs.My', 'main', 'problem', 'writing', 'plot', 'development', 'found', 'many', 'situations', 'characters', 'were', 'placed', 'be', 'highly', 'contrived', 'not', 'keeping', 'character', 'personality', 'example', 'one', 'Capn', 'Cook', 'cousins', 'called', 'Badger', 'recruited', 'sell', 'meth', 'up', 'potential', 'client', 'being', 'portrayed', 'dullard', 'correctly', 'potential', 'client', 'undercover', 'police', 'officer', 'meth', 'police', 'officer', 'immediately', 'busted', 'Unfortunately', 'plot', 'full', 'situations', 'where', 'characters', 'make', 'stupid', 'choices', 'choices', 'are', 'character', 'situations', 'are', 'created', 'advance', 'plot', 'placing', 'characters', 'new', 'situations', 'considering', 'how', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'found', 'plot', 'development', 'lack', 'subtlety', 'characters', 'could', 'be', 'placed', 'same', 'situations', 'more', 'finesse', 'resorting', 'having', 'characters', 'make', 'stupid', 'choices', 'choices', 'are', 'character', 'while', 'found', 'losing', 'interest', 'series', 'constantly', 'seeing', 'characters', 'make', 'stupid', 'choices', 'character', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'shown', 'be', 'smarter', 'that.My', 'actual', 'rank', '3.5', 'stars', 'have', 'rounded', 'up', 'four', 'can', 'overlook', 'glaring', 'holes', 'plot', 'development', 'rest', 'show', 'quite', 'engrossing']",N/A

Season 1 was, for lack of a better term, groundbreaking (but in every sense) and Season 2 was, at the time I thought, the possibly the best single season of a show I'd ever seen.  What floored me about this is, on paper, this show should not hold that title, but the acting, writing, directing and cinematography of the show really has no challenger.And then came along Season 3. The crazy part about it is its different in many ways from the other seasons.  There is an entire episode devoted to catching a fly (seriously).  Yet, it still does what it does, keep you captivated with a constant tension, lull you with the mundane then open up a firefight, and frame some of the best shots I've seen this side of a Hollywood movie.  Another milestone for Season 3, I feel, is the quality of the soundtrack - previous seasons were fine, but this season nails it with an eclectic mixture of songs that compliment the show and highlight excellent artists.Walt is not the same man he was in previous seasons, and here is where we plunge into the darkness, which finally aligns with his job. In this way, Season 3 brings some reconciliation of sorts, but its a cold comfort as our family man becomes the monster that a meth cook must be to survive.  The writing is superb, the acting continues to be some of the best I've seen on any screen, and the power and weight of this quirky little show about a cancer-stricken chemistry teacher cooking meth for his family's future has now secured itself in the halls of the best recorded entertainment ever produced.

This show is another one of those ""con"" jobs. Sorry, folks, but I found this show just plain lousy. It's depressing. It's glacially slow. The characters constantly bicker and fight in the most annoying ways. Almost all the characters are a-holes, jerky, uninteresting, unlikable, and unsympathetic. I disliked every single character on the show, especially Jesse, who has got to be the whiniest, most annoying, most unlikable character ever created for TV.  In short, this show was torture to watch. Sadly, the premise is good. It could have been a good show. The story idea was there.  But it is just written so poorly--unlikable protagonists, cliched bad guys, a story that moves at a snail's pace--so the promising premise is never developed into anything good. Even Bryan Cranston (who is a truly outstanding actor) seems bad on this show. His character has two notes, he's either bitter or angry. The people who should be bitter and angry are the people who get conned into watching this gratingly bad show.  And this season, Season 3 is especially bad, worse than the first two seasons.  Virtually nothing happens in the first 4 episodes of Season 3, these four episodes dragging on forever, as the ""story"" (or lack there of) focuses almost solely on a pending divorce between two characters (God is it boring).  Another bad episode later on is spent almost entirely in a hospital waiting room.  And then in another supremely bad episode, I swear to God, the whole episode is spent watching two characters try to kill a house fly!  Yes, the show is that bad!  And it eventually gets totally unrealistic as characters do things (like murder people or plot murders) which seem TOTALLY out of character for these characters on the show.  Season 3 just gets way over the top in the worst possible way.  And I've never seen a show with so many meaningless just-there-to-waste-time ""filler"" shots.  It's like every scene begins with meaningless time-wasting montages of landscapes or super slow panning shots.  This show is SO slow.  Badly written.  Badly edited.  Bad everything.

Much like the first two seasons the taunt, suspenseful series continues to built towards a fiery conclusion for Walt (Bryan Cranston) and Jesse (Aaron Paul) who have moved up in the world from crystal meth makers for low level crazy drug kingpin Tuco to working for the biggest distributor (Giancarlo Esposito) of drugs in the lower half of the U.S. Both Walt and Jesse find themselves in the crosshairs of Tuco's enforcer cousins and all those around them may become nothing more than collateral damage if someone doesn't stop them.As with the previous two seasons Emmy winners Cranston and Paul are only the tip of the superb acting iceberg with Anna Gun, Dean Norris, Betsy Brandt, R.J. Mitte, Bob Odenkirk, Giancarlo Esposito (a terrific actor that I've followed since the lamented quirky TV show ""Bakersfield P.D."") all worthy of Emmy recognition as they dig deeply into their characters to provide us with new shadings with each episode. This could only happen with the terrific writing of creator Vince Gilligan (""The X-Files"") and his team and kudos to the directors and D.P. for bringing a unique look, burned look to the series.The Blu-ray looks even better than the HD broadcast of the show which I wasn't sure would be the case; there's richer gritty detail in evidence watching the Blu-ray.The 13 episodes receive a nice selection of special features including commentary tracks on episodes ""No Mas,"" ""Mas,"" ""Sunset,"" ""One Minute,"" ""I See You,"" ""Kafkaesque,"" ""Fly,"" ""Half Measures,"" and ""Full Measure.""""Better Call Saul Commercials and Testimonials"" allows Bob Odenkirk to riff on his sleazy lawyer on why he should represent YOU.

There is also some out-of-character dialog, such as Jesse making profound and subtle remarks, and Hank not being his usual doofus self, for no good reason.Skyler remains the principal villain of the piece. She is repeatedly called a b**** -- which she is -- and Goodman even says he doesn't understand why she and Walter ever married.
