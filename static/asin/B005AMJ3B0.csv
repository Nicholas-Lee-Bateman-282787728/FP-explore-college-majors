The second DVD has three movies. Tales of Terror, The Pit And The Pendulum and The Raven. All of these movies are digital. I got the packet for $10.14. It was a great set but there are no scene selections. Only a menu page. So you have to fast forward the movies. My set was brand new but halfway through Pit the film became blurred but clears up. Now I have the single of Pit and Pendulum and it has to be zoomed in but the picture is clear and the color is good all the way through the movie. All the movies on the packet are on a matted widescreen so you don't have to zoom in Pit. For some reason with Pit on the part with the organ music the movie is blurred then clears up. Also in another scene there are colored dots for a second. The picture and color is better than on my single of Pit and the Pendulum but my single movie has NO TECHNICAL FLAWS. Evidently the zooming in of Pit on the packet caused it to have some technical blotches. All of these movies CAN be purchased in the single or double features.  There is a  D/F of Mad House and Masque of the Red Death and a three movie feature on a single disc of Tales of Terror/ Pit and Pendulum and The Raven. Or The Raven comes in a D/F with Comedy of Terrors. The Packet came in a nice hard cardboard box with the 2 DVDs inside with Vincent Price on the front.

Watching DVDs in wide-screen on a new BD player is a perfectly acceptable experience when the original aspect ratio is applied on the disc. These discs run at a steady 4.0Mbps (lows of 3 and highs of 8 in between) on all the movies which works out to a 360p resolution that is then progressive scanned to 720p and the result is an excellent overall image. ""The Raven"" is my favorite Vinnie movie (even tho Peter Lorre steals the show) and is a classic in my opinion. ""Masque"" is creepy, Gothic and Vinnie is at his evil best in this one. ""Pit"" I would give a 3 out of 5; it would be a 4 if not for John Kerr's stuffy, plodding performance. ""Terror"" has some enthusiastic fans, I am not one, it's OK.

1452339,A10RGJ0NVVGODV,B005AMJ3B0,Ron Wise,"[89, 90]","I took a chance when I ordered this DVD box set, but it was worth the gamble. All five of these Vincent Price films are reproduced with the utmost care. The colors are bright, the pictures sharp, and the sound excellent. Movies released in widescreen are in that format here.The downside to this set is that it is totally no-frills. No commentary, no original trailers of the movies, etc. But what I consider to be the biggest shortfall of this set is that none of the movies are divided into chapters. This gives the viewer two choices: either watch the film in one sitting; or fast-forward through the movie later to try to find the place where the viewer stopped watching the film.The upside to the set is that you get some Vincent Price horror classics that are pricey in other DVD offerings (such as MGM's ""Midnite Movies"" double feature series). In this set are four of the great Vincent Price/Roger Corman Edgar Allan Poe films: The Pit and the Pendulum (1961); The Raven (1962); Tales of Terror (1963); and The Masque of the Red Death(1964). The fifth film in the set is Madhouse from 1974. Madhouse is basically a slasher movie with a lot of gory scenes, unlike the more restrained Poe films.Some cool things about this set are that the DVDs come in a nice gift box made of heavy cardboard. The graphics on the box lid are somewhat three dimensional. The flames behind Price seem to glow and an old house appears from the darkness when the box is held under a bright light.  The DVDs inside the box are in two quality plastic DVD cases with colorful graphics and information about each film.
