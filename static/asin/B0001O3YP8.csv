812333,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B0001O3YP8,Chrijeff,"[0, 0]","12-year-old Jesse (Jason James Richter) is an Angry Young Boy, and not without reason: six years ago his mother dumped him on the doorstep of Family Services and took off, and not even the Federal government has been able to find out where she is.  But Jesse stubbornly insists that she will return for him someday, and meanwhile he's not interested in co-operating with anyone, including his caseworker Dwight Mercer (Mykelti Williamson) or any of the foster homes he's gone to.  Temporarily loose, he and a friend are vandalizing a local aquarium when he comes face-to-nose with a captive orca and is utterly entranced.  Required to clean up the damage he's done, he accepts the sentence willingly for the chance to learn more about Willy the whale (Keiko), even though it also means another foster home with Glen and Annie Greenwood (Michael Madsen, Jayne Atkinson).  Inexplicably a bond grows up between the boy and the cetacean, and Jesse even turns out to be able to train Willy to respond to cues so he can take part in the aquarium's show.  In the process he is befriended by Haida Indian maintenance man Randolph Johnson (August Schellenberg) and would-be marine biologist Rae Lindley (Lori Petty).  Then Jesse happens to witness an attempt by aquarium owner Wade (Richard Riehle) to sabotage Willy's tank so the whale will die and the insurance on him can be cashed in.  Enlisting Randolph and Rae in a race against time, Jesse sets out to return Willy to the ocean.In the sequel, Jesse is now 14 or 15, still living with the Greenwoods and even calling Glen his ""dad,"" when he suddenly learns that his missing mother has recently died--and left him with an eight-year-old half-brother, Elvis (Francis Capra).  Though the Greenwoods willingly take Elvis in, Jesse isn't at all sure he wants anything to do with the kid, who's not only a little-brotherish kind of pest but a compulsive teller of tall tales.  However, a vacation trip to visit his old friend Randolph, now working with a marine biologist (Elizabeth Pena), brings him back into contact with his whale friend Willy, who has rejoined the pod of his birth--and hasn't fprgotten his human buddy.  As Jesse tries to sort through his relationship with Elvis and the pangs of first love with Randolph's goddaughter Nadine (Mary Kate Schellhardt), an oil spill suddenly imperils the whales, and the three youngsters make common cause to save them.Another two years on, and we find Jesse crewing with Randolph and his new employer Drew Halbert (Annie Corley), who are still studying Willy and his pod.  What they don't know is that supposed salmon fisherman John Wesley (Patrick Kilpatrick) and his crew are really clandestine whalers--and they've got Willy's pod in their sights.  Unexpected help comes in the form of Wesley's young son Max (Vincent Berry), who, like Jesse before him, sees Willy and is lost.  Now it's a race against time to save the orcas from Wesley.With real whales in the cast, this trilogy is suspenseful and family-friendly, and Jesse's development is well portrayed too.  Each movie could be the launch point for some good family discussion as well as an entertaining evening's watching.",4,A boy and his whale,1290729600,"11 26, 2010",2010,3178,"['12-year-old', 'Jesse', 'Jason', 'James', 'Richter', 'Angry', 'Young', 'Boy', 'not', 'reason', 'six', 'years', 'mother', 'dumped', 'doorstep', 'Family', 'Services', 'took', 'off', 'not', 'even', 'Federal', 'government', 'been', 'able', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'Jesse', 'stubbornly', 'will', 'return', 'someday', 'meanwhile', 'not', 'interested', 'co-operating', 'anyone', 'including', 'caseworker', 'Dwight', 'Mercer', 'Mykelti', 'Williamson', 'foster', 'homes', 'gone', 'Temporarily', 'loose', 'friend', 'are', 'vandalizing', 'local', 'aquarium', 'when', 'face-to-nose', 'captive', 'orca', 'utterly', 'entranced', 'Required', 'clean', 'up', 'damage', 'done', 'sentence', 'willingly', 'chance', 'learn', 'more', 'Willy', 'whale', 'Keiko', 'even', 'also', 'foster', 'home', 'Glen', 'Annie', 'Greenwood', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'Jayne', 'Atkinson', 'Inexplicably', 'bond', 'up', 'boy', 'cetacean', 'Jesse', 'even', 'out', 'be', 'able', 'train', 'Willy', 'respond', 'cues', 'can', 'take', 'part', 'aquarium', 'show', 'process', 'befriended', 'Haida', 'Indian', 'maintenance', 'man', 'Randolph', 'Johnson', 'August', 'Schellenberg', 'would-be', 'marine', 'biologist', 'Rae', 'Lindley', 'Lori', 'Petty', 'Then', 'Jesse', 'witness', 'attempt', 'aquarium', 'owner', 'Wade', 'Richard', 'Riehle', 'sabotage', 'Willy', 'tank', 'whale', 'will', 'die', 'insurance', 'can', 'be', 'cashed', 'Enlisting', 'Randolph', 'Rae', 'race', 'time', 'Jesse', 'out', 'return', 'Willy', 'ocean.In', 'sequel', 'Jesse', 'now', '14', '15', 'still', 'living', 'Greenwoods', 'even', 'calling', 'Glen', 'dad', 'when', 'suddenly', 'missing', 'mother', 'recently', 'died', 'left', 'eight-year-old', 'half-brother', 'Elvis', 'Francis', 'Capra', 'Greenwoods', 'willingly', 'take', 'Elvis', 'Jesse', ""n't"", 'sure', 'anything', 'do', 'kid', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'little-brotherish', 'kind', 'pest', 'compulsive', 'teller', 'tall', 'tales', 'However', 'vacation', 'trip', 'visit', 'old', 'friend', 'Randolph', 'now', 'working', 'marine', 'biologist', 'Elizabeth', 'Pena', 'back', 'contact', 'whale', 'friend', 'Willy', 'who', 'rejoined', 'pod', 'birth', ""n't"", 'fprgotten', 'human', 'buddy', 'Jesse', 'sort', 'relationship', 'Elvis', 'pangs', 'first', 'love', 'Randolph', 'goddaughter', 'Nadine', 'Mary', 'Kate', 'Schellhardt', 'oil', 'spill', 'suddenly', 'whales', 'three', 'youngsters', 'make', 'common', 'cause', 'save', 'two', 'years', 'find', 'Jesse', 'crewing', 'Randolph', 'new', 'employer', 'Drew', 'Halbert', 'Annie', 'Corley', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'studying', 'Willy', 'pod', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'supposed', 'salmon', 'fisherman', 'John', 'Wesley', 'Patrick', 'Kilpatrick', 'crew', 'are', 'really', 'clandestine', 'whalers', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Willy', 'pod', 'sights', 'Unexpected', 'help', 'form', 'Wesley', 'young', 'son', 'Max', 'Vincent', 'Berry', 'who', 'Jesse', 'Willy', 'lost', 'Now', 'race', 'time', 'save', 'orcas', 'Wesley.With', 'real', 'whales', 'cast', 'trilogy', 'suspenseful', 'family-friendly', 'Jesse', 'development', 'well', 'portrayed', 'too', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'launch', 'point', 'good', 'family', 'discussion', 'as', 'well', 'entertaining', 'evening', 'watching']",Free Willy Collection
