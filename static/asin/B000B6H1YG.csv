Here, we get the Danish director Billy August creating a hypnotic imaging of desolate Oklahoma small towns, an innocent woman on death row, and the various players around her story in the last days leading up to her execution. As always, Aidan Quinn is just right for his part as a complex lawyer turned tabloid huckster and alcoholic, who finally finds redemption in the last motel on the rain slick streets. But the real standout here is the always underrated Connie Nielsen, who smolders in this performance and the chemistry between her and Quinn is what great movies (and their moments) are made of.

936704,A42QN9MM6LKKM,B000B6H1YG,Lee in S.F.,"[5, 5]","I was prepared to be underwhelmed by this movie, based on some of the comments.  Instead, however, I ended up glad that I'd lucked out and found a good movie to watch!  (That is, it wasn't one of those Prime movies that I click off after half an hour, because it just isn't holding my attention.)Yes, it did start slowly, as some have noted, and yes, the bleak Oklahoma landscape shown in the beginning isn't much appealing.  Even so, as the viewer soon discovers, in this ""it looks like nothing happens here"" environment, there is a LOT going on behind the scenes!  What the movie does well is to artfully present, through character interactions, a reliable stream of hints and clues about those ""not so ordinary"" happenings.  This sustained suspense makes the movie compelling and intriguing.Connie Nielsen is outstanding in her portrayal of a widow convicted of child kidnap and murder.  She doesn't necessarily ""act"" like a cold-blooded killer (isn't dead behind the eyes, etc.).  Still, she presents enough of an odd detachment, along with some quirkiness, that I kept wondering if she'd committed the crime or not.  Well along into the movie, I still didn't know quite how to regard her, and so (as part of that suspense factor), I was always wanting to know more.Aidan Quinn, playing a washed up attorney with seemingly shady motives, is likewise more than he first seems to be at the movie's outset.  His character experiences a slow metamorphosis, which caused me to increasingly warm up to his role.  I respect a movie which delivers plausibility for a character's evolving perspectives (because it seems like the script is respecting me as a viewer).  Here, Quinn's confusion, his reflection, his twists and turns, etc., are never forced, and so they never arbitrarily manipulate the audience.  Rather, they serve to give his character depth and appeal.Kelly Preston, as the attorney for the convict, has a smaller role, but the story would not have been nearly as good without her!  She is very well-cast, and lends a strong presence.  Her nuanced portrayal makes her character seem like a real person who happens to practice law (rather than being a stick figure caricature of a lawyer).  Rarely do I see a film where three key characters all end up giving top notch performances, but I'm glad to say that this movie is a fine exception.  The supporting characters were also good, for the most part.I had no problem keeping my interest from the beginning.  Even so, I noticed that I was getting more and more drawn in as the movie progressed, and that was a great feeling.  One reviewer here said that the final 15 minutes were what made the movie worthwhile.  It's true that the conclusion is a stirring reward.  Still, I could never dismiss what comes before it, because the context and character developments offered prior to the finale, are completely essential.  All kinds of seemingly unrelated loose threads get wrapped up then, and it all happens in ways that cannot be predicted.For me, the story lacks some plausibility, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five.  Still, I was more than happy to sacrifice some plausibility for a compelling sense of suspense and well-drawn characters.  I like a movie that's as much about the characters as it is about the plot.The subtle pacing invited more engagement from me than I'd likely give to, say, an action movie.  The fact that my attention was required especially made the movie ""get into me.""  I was engaged enough that after the video concluded, I found myself musing a bit, speculating about what would happen next to the characters shown in the final scene.  Having enjoyed the movie a lot, I guess I didn't want it to be over!Go and ahead and give the video a try (especially if you're a Prime member!).

It starts showing a con man of sorts, Frank Nitzche (Aidan Quinn) a former lawyer who must have been expelled from the bar.  It is not clear, but, at any rate, he has turned con man and earns money befriending people on death row through letters.  He knows how to get their attention and then becomes a friend of sorts that requests they keep in touch up until their death.  He only asks they write a ""last letter"" to him, which usually goes on the market for a good price.  He keeps newspaper articles attached to the wall of current convicted murderers he is writing to, to keep stories straight and sort of a filing system.  Charlotte Cory (Connie Nielsen) , is the only female, and as he starts writing to her she quickly responds that he is the only one that has given her some comfort and to please come and visit her in person.  She also calls him, and he is taken aback, as she requests he come and see her.  When he hesitates she sounds like she will not correspond for the valuable letters he needs.  His agent is furious as this is the prime letter, the only ones from a female on death row and demands he visit her and keep on her ""sweet side"" for a last letter worth $300,000.  So Frank is going under another name in the letters (his name is well known in legal circles).  He devises a disguise and driver's license to get into the prison as the man who cares, and writes the letters.  Soon Frank falls in love with Charlotte, and becomes determined to save her from execution.  Charlotte seems hesitant, which is strange, determined to die.  Charlotte's lawyer (Kelly Preston) has been furiously working on an appeal.  There are many facets to the strange case but Frank races to prove Charlotte's innocence before time runs out.""Convicted"" is a movie that I had not heard of before- made in 2004.
