It contains several classic Cookie Monster clips (e.g., C is for Cookie, If moon was cookie) all strung together with a story line of Cookie Monster starting a business as a baker. This is about a 30 minute DVD. I love that it has other Sesame Street characters (thankfully, not Elmo!) but they only do cameos. The big focus is on Cookie Monster and he has a great sense of humor. I especially loved the sigh of frustration Cookie Monster makes when Annette Benning asks him questions about 'here' and 'there.'

Cookie Monster is so loveable in this program. And the songs that they put into the program are so cute. My favorite has to be ""C DRIVES ME CRAZY"".  If you were around in the 80's you will get a kick out of this song.  Just a very cute program that should be part of every kids collection for Sesame Street.

783240,A26WVK274IA7DN,B0000TGAGO,Sarah Bellum,"[10, 10]","I find this DVD rather mediocre, too brief and even a little annoying. Cookie Monster has had better appearances, the DVD runs a scant thirty minutes and there is a video for one song in which Cookie Monster does not even appear. My two-year old son, however, loves it and watches it repeatedly. Since he is the intended audience, I give it four stars. He doesn't scrutinize the quality of the skits the way I do and anything more than thirty minutes would challenge his attention span. In addition to the obvious inclusion of ""C is For Cookie,"" the DVD also includes a fantasy about the moon being a giant cookie, sharing cookies with friends, bidding adieu to a beloved cookie and a skit with Annette Bening. As one would expect with content from Sesame Street, the material is educational and teaches acceptance and social skills. It is brought together by a running skit, specifically created for this video, featuring Cookie Monster as a newly employed baker... with expected results. Caution should be exercised because anyone familiar with Cookie Monster already knows that your toddler will pick up poor eating habits, meaning stuffing cookies into their mouths and leaving crumbs all over.
