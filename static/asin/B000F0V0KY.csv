I came across Project Runway Season 2 and noticed that it was very cheap! I had seen numerous seasons of Project Runway being advertised on tv but had never watched it. As I'm a fan of some reality tv I decided that the price was cheap enough to take a gamble and bought it. I ended up liking this so much I promptly bought all the other seasons that were available at the time, (seasons 1 to 6). After watching all of them I've decided that season 2 is my favourite. The characters on this season seem alot more interesting that in any other season. You get evil ones, funny ones, moany ones and nice ones. There is plenty of drama, with one contestant breaking down on the runway while being interrogated by the judges. Seasons 1 - 4 are very good, seasons 5 and 6 are only average with less interesting contestants. If you are looking for something new to watch, give this season a go.

Me being the slave to fashion that i am just never got around to watching the show.I found myself at Staples the other day buying some pens, when i came across an eight dollar DVD rack at the register. I found myself glued to a bargain, but had no intention of getting anything else buy pens that day. Needless to say i was rummaging and found Project Runway season two in the pile of sorted DVDs and decided to examine it thoroughly before finally making a choice. I had to make sure it was a very long show, had enough episodes, and had decent extras before i finally decided to purchase the season two set.This is my favorite season and it's the awesome cast that really makes it a stand out, knock out, special season. There was crazy Andrae with his insane gestures, Santino with his crazy over the top jokes including a dead on impersonation of Tim Gunn, down to earth genuine cutie pie Nick Verreos who really should have been in the top three, and Zelema Griffin who turned up the heat when she said to Kara: ""You can cry, but you have to sew and cry."" And let's not forget when she decided to get fierce and had a fashion model walk off in episode eight.I am so hooked on this show that i ran out for all the other season though i was a bit disappointed in season three. Please pick up this DVD and watch the show everyone's been talking about.

981181,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B000F0V0KY,barry,"[1, 1]","PROJECT RUNWAY is above and beyond my very favorite reality show.  The way it is filmed and produced is so impressive.  The shows gets truly talented designers as contestants, the judges are true infamous people in the fashion industry and Heidi Klum is a very intelligent and articulate host who is just as knowledgable on the fashion as the judges.  And the biggest star is Tim Gunn, the kind of mentor we all wish we had.  He is the true heart of the show as he shares his wisdom and guidance on each garment being made.Season 1 became a huge hit and season 2 came on at an even more entertaining level.  The caliber and diversity of the designers is immense.  Also the personalities were a perfect mix for some real fun back stage drama.  My favorite has always been Daniel V but we also have Santino, Andre, Diana, Chloe and Nick.  The challenges are imaginative and lots of fun.  This dvd set is a must have for there are truly extended episodes with added never before seen footage.  There are is also a ton of extras on this season.  Bloopers and extended footage of the shows highlights.  The WEAR ARE THEY NOW segments are also very informative.I must comment on the review that stated it was all staged and that the judges don't actually make the decision on who is eliminated.  Reviews here are meant for personal opinions.  We may not agree with others but all have a right to voice their opinions.  But stating facts incorrectly just infuriates me.  The print at the end of the show cleary states that the judges consider the opinions of the producers and the network Bravo as well when making the elimination decision.  But they are ultimately the final voice.  This makes perfect sense and is perfectly acceptable.  Michael Kors is a world renowned designer and Nina Garcia is huge in the fashion industry.  There are also guest judges such as Vera Wang.  These people are all of the highest caliber and the show is first rate.  None of these people would participate on something that was not truly on the up and up.  This show is a hugely enjoyable foundation that honestly judges the contestants fashion.  It just upsets me that this misinformation could keep someone from  watching the show.If you have never seen this show you must give it a try.  It will suck you in and you will become a fashionista more than you ever imagined.  I can watch thes seasons over and over.Every season is intelligent, truly based on the creations of talented designers and the show builds to fashion week when the final 3 get to showcase their line.

Season 2 is basically the same format as its predecessor. Heidi Klum & Tim Gunn are back on board as hostess and advisor, respectively. The show begins with 16 designer hopefuls and narrows down to the final 3 who get to execute a complete line of designs for NYC Fashion Week. As before, what I enjoyed the most was the creativity. This season, watch the designers create a dress manufactured completely out of plants, lingerie for Heidi, an evening gown for model superstar Iman (to be worn on the red carpet at an event), an outfit for My Scene Barbie, and an outfit for Olympic skating silver medalist Sasha Cohen. There are other challenges as well through the season.It is extremely interesting to hear what the judges have to say about each designer and their creations. Michael Kors & Nina Garcia (Elle Magazine) are back again giving their sometimes cutting but accurate critiques. This season, the designers are much more vocal and sometimes talk back with disrespect to the judges (would you dare to question or sass back at Diane von Furstenberg?!?). The designers are not quite as loveable as the first season, but there are still many ""characters"" which are interesting to watch, most notably Santino Rice, the insensitive loudmouth and sometime ""villain"" of season 2. Debra Messing of ""Will & Grace"" joins the judges for the NYC Fashion Week critique of the Final 3.Extras on the 4 DVD set include: outtakes & bloopers (do we really need to see Andr&eacute;'s crying scene unedited or Santino verbally sparring with Nina?), WEAR Are They Now (for the Final 3 contestants only), Cast Audition Tapes, Tim Gunn's Blog (which is an interesting episode-by-episode blog of Gunn's thoughts), and an Exclusive Season 3 Casting Call shot at LA's Hyatt Regency Century Plaza Hotel.

981186,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B000F0V0KY,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[1, 1]","""Project Runway"" is high-quality reality TV. This sounds like an oxymoron, I know, but it's true: this is a show where the results are based on talent, and on the contestant's ability to function in the real world of fashion. The demands made on them are extreme, but realistic, and winners rise or fall based on their actual ability, not on any of the flawed metrics of other reality shows (audience polls, political maneuvering by other contestants, etc.) It is a compelling, watchable show, packed with knowledgeable, helpful and unyielding judges, and a host of flawed, talented participants.Season Two finds the show's format being tinkered with and perfected -- the staging and editing are slicker, and some interesting twists are added to the strategic end of the elimination process. That being said, the pool of contestants is less compelling than in the rawer Season One, and their work is also less striking. Where the premiere season had several amazing designers with strong personal aesthetics, Season Two is marked by mundane, seat-of-the-pants design work. Other than the unlikeable, egotistical Santino Rice (who turns out to be more sympathetic towards the end) few of the designers seems to have a cohesive creative vision, and for weeks on end only a scarce handful of striking outfits appear. (This is pointed out by the show's major domo, Tim Gunn, when the talent pool is whittled down to six: he bluntly tells them that their work has been dull, and to kick it into gear.)On the other hand, the interpersonal dynamic between the designers, which takes a long time to gel, is ultimately fascinating. Most of the contestants are actually rather nice people, and other than in small, selfish moments, they are emotionally and materially supportive of each other, even helping a flustered friend finish some stitching when the clock starts to run out. This is something you don't often see in the back-biting world of ""reality"" games shows: humanity. And in many ways, it made the final elimination rounds much more poignant, since by and large, the most talented, most likable contestants were the ones left onscreen.While no Jay or Austin emerged from this season, it was still pretty fun.

Each episode introduces a new challenge for the designers in which they have minimal time to sketch and purchase materials for the challenge, always accomplished under significant time restraints.  The challenges themselves are often very interesting, such as the challenge to create clothing from non-traditional materials (e.g. items from a pet store, flowers, or items reconstructed from their own pajamas).In addition to the challenges, the designers themselves bring a lot of color and character to the show.  The mentor, Tim Gunn, is terrific at encouraging the designers to to do their best with his trademark ""Make It Work, Designers!""  And if that isn't enough, the judges (Michael Kors and Nina Garcia) offer thoughful critiques.  And then there is the third judge and show host, Heidi Klum, who offers valuable input and something pretty to look at.But at the core of it all is the fashion.
