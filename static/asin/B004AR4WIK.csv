Heiremans,"[19, 20]","I watched this on Netflix, which was probably a good decision, since every fifteen minutes I would have to pause it, call my boyfriend into the room, rewind it, and then watch it all over again. There are some amazing developments chronicled in this series, a lot of which have an ""I want that!"" quality to them. The host is pretty freakin' funny, as well. He's not somber or pedantic in any way.Perhaps one of the best things about this Nova series is that it's easy to understand (as far as Nova science and technology features are concerned). For many Nova series (think Brian Greene...) I find myself needing to pause and take a break/give my brain a rest. While those are still great and thought-provoking, this series is much less work without sacraficing any of the mind stimulation that so often leads to my conversations after Nova :)",5,Pretty Superb,1320883200,"11 10, 2011",2011,843,"['watched', 'Netflix', 'was', 'probably', 'good', 'decision', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'would', 'have', 'pause', 'call', 'boyfriend', 'room', 'rewind', 'then', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'are', 'amazing', 'developments', 'chronicled', 'series', 'lot', 'have', 'want', 'quality', 'host', 'pretty', 'freakin', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'somber', 'pedantic', 'way.Perhaps', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'Nova', 'series', 'easy', 'understand', 'as', 'far', 'Nova', 'science', 'technology', 'features', 'are', 'concerned', 'many', 'Nova', 'series', 'think', 'Brian', 'Greene', 'find', 'needing', 'pause', 'take', 'break/give', 'brain', 'rest', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'thought-provoking', 'series', 'much', 'less', 'work', 'sacraficing', 'mind', 'stimulation', 'so', 'often', 'conversations', 'Nova']",N/A

Host David Pogue does his usual job of providing clear, interesting, and often humorous background for the material.
