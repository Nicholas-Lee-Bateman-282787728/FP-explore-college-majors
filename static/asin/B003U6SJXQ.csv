He has been getting away with it since childhood. He murders a local prostitute played by Jessica Alba. So sure that he would not be implicated, he is taken unawares when clues start to point to him. So in order to set things straight he embarks on a cleaning up mission which involves killing people.Although this movie has a good teaser, it just fails to catch fire. Every thirty minutes or so, I expected that things would perk up but they never did. There is a lot of gruesome violence especially against women, which some may find revolting. There are  a lot of funny lines and interesting dialogue but the story fails. The actors are all wasted, the females have nothing to do except serve as punching bags for Affleck. Casey Affleck does a great job portraying a psychotic killer but his emotional mind is never fully explored, that would have been interesting.

I'm not one of those who likes hollywood feel-good movies, but I don't see the point to this film.I really didn't mind if the villian prevailed in the end, but he didn't, everyone got blown up!! I didn't enjoy the brutal woman beatings scenes too. I know those scenes may be the ""highlights"" of the story, it just didn't do it for me. Which brings me to my next point...What's the deal with Casey Affleck?? He has only got one expression throughout the entire film which made the character so one dimensional. I don't feel anything from his character portayal besides the cold and emotionless look on his face. Whats with the mumbling in a funny voice?? I found the film a real PAIN to watch because of him.I do not recommend this film... although the acting from the leading ladies and actors in supporting roles were commendable, I ultimately see no point to the story.

1363065,A30TQET02FLSUX,B003U6SJXQ,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[1, 2]","Ever since I first saw the movie poster for The Killer Inside Me (2010)', I've wanted to check out the film. The poster is a great blend of graphics and photography with a retro dramatic twist. This is one of my favorite movie poster designs in recent years. It made me think of David Fincher's perfect serial killer film Se7en (1995). I'm also a fan of director Michael Winterbottom and his film The Claim (2000), so that was another thing that drew me to this movie. But having seen The Killer Inside Me on Showtime HD today, I feel it's a mixed bag as a movie. I give it 3 stars out of 5, mostly because the acting, production design and cinematography are top notch and deserve the bump up from 2.5 stars that I initially felt the film deserved.The story and characters in this movie just didn't connect with me...even though they tried and tried to get inside me. I read someone's review of the film and they felt that the story is told from the point of view of the psychotic killer that it is about, with mixed emotions, mixed thoughts, etc. While I respect and understand that choice by the writers and the director, assuming that they chose it, it just didn't work as well as I think it could have. I think what's missing is something that emotionally pulls the viewer into the killer's mindset and helps us  understand what's going on in his head that causes his gradual and yet abrupt ""psychotic snap"". Maybe more flashbacks to his childhood past that show why he is a killer inside. Winterbottom uses voiceover narration by 'Casey Affleck's' character Lou Ford to help get us into his mindset, but the narrative is so flat that it just doesn't work. I was left wanting to know more about how Lou got to this point in his life. But instead, it ended just as it started...abruptly. The ending of the movie didin't quite work for me either. It wants to be a ""twist"" ending that thrills you, but it just didn't...even though it did surprise me.What I will give this film props for is its awesome production design by 'Mark Tildesley'. There's no question we are back in the dusty past of West Texas. The sets and locations feel genuine and right for the story. Lou's house is a great specimen of Western U.S. craftsman architecture. I also loved 'Marcel Zyskind's' photography for the film. While not flashy or gorgeous, it was stylish and had this sun-bleached look to it like West Texas itself has.Casey Affleck continues his recent streak of great acting gigs, following in the footsteps of his good performances in 'Gone Baby Gone (2007)', 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)', 'and The Last Kiss (2006)'. But of course I will always think of his work in 'Good Will Hunting (1997)' first and foremost, since that is where I was introduced to him and his brother Ben.While The Killer Inside Me is not a classic ""killer"" film like ''Se7e'n' (1995)', 'No Country For Old Men (2007)', 'The Cell (2000)', 'Fracture (2004)', 'Kiss The Girls (1997)', 'Insomnia (2002)', or 'The Silence of the Lambs (1991)', it's still worthy of viewing at least once to appreciate it for its cinematic craftsmanship.",3,"Not a Classic ""Killer"" Movie...But Worth a View",1290902400,"11 28, 2010",2010,3136,"['Ever', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'poster', 'Killer', 'Inside', 'Me', '2010', ""'ve"", 'wanted', 'check', 'out', 'film', 'poster', 'great', 'blend', 'graphics', 'photography', 'retro', 'dramatic', 'twist', 'one', 'favorite', 'movie', 'poster', 'designs', 'recent', 'years', 'made', 'think', 'David', 'Fincher', 'perfect', 'serial', 'killer', 'film', 'Se7en', '1995', ""'m"", 'also', 'fan', 'director', 'Michael', 'Winterbottom', 'film', 'Claim', '2000', 'was', 'thing', 'drew', 'movie', 'having', 'seen', 'Killer', 'Inside', 'Me', 'Showtime', 'HD', 'today', 'feel', 'mixed', 'bag', 'movie', 'give', '3', '5', 'mostly', 'acting', 'production', 'design', 'cinematography', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'deserve', 'bump', 'up', '2.5', 'stars', 'initially', 'felt', 'film', 'deserved.The', 'story', 'characters', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'connect', 'even', 'tried', 'tried', 'get', 'read', 'someone', 'review', 'film', 'felt', 'story', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'mixed', 'thoughts', 'etc', 'respect', 'understand', 'choice', 'writers', 'director', 'assuming', 'chose', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'think', 'what', 'missing', 'something', 'emotionally', 'viewer', 'killer', 'mindset', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'head', 'gradual', 'yet', 'abrupt', 'psychotic', 'snap', 'Maybe', 'more', 'flashbacks', 'childhood', 'show', 'why', 'killer', 'inside', 'Winterbottom', 'voiceover', 'narration', ""'Casey"", 'Affleck', 'character', 'Lou', 'Ford', 'help', 'get', 'mindset', 'narrative', 'so', 'flat', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'was', 'left', 'wanting', 'know', 'more', 'how', 'Lou', 'got', 'point', 'life', 'instead', 'ended', 'just', 'started', 'abruptly', 'ending', 'movie', 'didi', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'be', 'twist', 'ending', 'thrills', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'did', 'surprise', 'me.What', 'will', 'give', 'film', 'props', 'awesome', 'production', 'design', ""'Mark"", 'Tildesley', 'question', 'are', 'back', 'dusty', 'past', 'West', 'Texas', 'sets', 'locations', 'feel', 'genuine', 'right', 'story', 'Lou', 'house', 'great', 'specimen', 'Western', 'U.S.', 'craftsman', 'architecture', 'also', 'loved', ""'Marcel"", 'Zyskind', 'photography', 'film', 'not', 'flashy', 'gorgeous', 'was', 'stylish', 'had', 'sun-bleached', 'look', 'West', 'Texas', 'has.Casey', 'Affleck', 'recent', 'streak', 'great', 'acting', 'gigs', 'following', 'footsteps', 'good', 'performances', ""'Gone"", 'Baby', 'Gone', '2007', 'Assassination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Coward', 'Robert', 'Ford', '2007', 'Last', 'Kiss', '2006', 'course', 'will', 'always', 'think', 'work', ""'Good"", 'Will', 'Hunting', '1997', 'first', 'foremost', 'where', 'was', 'introduced', 'brother', 'Killer', 'Inside', 'Me', 'not', 'classic', 'killer', 'film', 'Se7e', 'n', '1995', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', '2007', ""'The"", 'Cell', '2000', ""'Fracture"", '2004', 'Girls', '1997', ""'Insomnia"", '2002', 'Silence', 'Lambs', '1991', 'still', 'worthy', 'viewing', 'least', 'once', 'appreciate', 'cinematic', 'craftsmanship']",N/A

Each scene is about a minute long, and yes, they're pretty brutal.However, if you can stomach that kind of thing, then I DO recommend you see this movie!Basically, the story revolves around Lou, who is a small-town sheriff. He winds up getting involved in some scheme to get a prostitute out of town, but ends up in bed with said women, and then falls in love with her. Their relationship is a sadomasochistic one, to boot. Anyway, even though he loves her...he winds up killing her (and enjoying it), as well as his fiancee later in the movie. Lou ""seems"" like such a nice guy...but what's great about this movie is seeing his sadism leak out here and there. He truly is a sociopath.

1363067,A1KE3JBO3KQX2O,B003U6SJXQ,Brian C.,"[0, 0]","I watched this movie right after I finished reading the novel by Jim Thompson (when I say right after I mean minutes after). The movie is quite faithful to the book. I spotted very few deviations from the book and the movie actually helped to clarify a number of plot points I was vague about after reading the book. If you have read the book, and you enjoyed it, I recommend watching the movie. I think they did a good job adapting it for the screen and all the acting seemed excellent to me.The movie is quite disturbing (more disturbing than the book which I thought was lighter in tone). The book it is based on is a first person narration told from the point of view of a serial killer. The story follows a small town deputy sheriff who suffers from a sickness which we usually call sociopathy or psychopathy. He has kept it under control for years until a new prostitute shows up in town that awakes the demon. The narrator does not really have any redeeming moral qualities. People who think that books or movies - or art in general - should have a moral purpose or at least confirm our standard moral values will probably find this movie rather despicable.However, anyone looking to this movie for moral education is looking in the wrong place. Lou Ford is not being held up as a hero in this film or someone to emulate and it is quite clear that no one is endorsing the kind of behavior that is being portrayed in the film. I would also point out that, unlike most shoot em' up movies made today, the violence in this movie is actually hard to watch, which is what violence should be! I think more damage is done by movies that portray violence as ""exciting"" and ""fun"" than by movies like this that portray violence as genuinely horrifying.There are two really horrific scenes in this movie and they are shot as they should be: with very little embellishment. It is just bare. There is no fancy choreography, no crashing through windows, no flying kicks, no dramatic music (that I remember). There is nothing cool, slick, romantic or exciting about it. When you are watching Lou beat Joyce, or Amy lying twitching on the floor in a puddle of her own urine, you just want it to end. You get to see how sickening that kind of violence really is. Which is why I think some of the moral criticisms of this movie miss the mark. It is a brutal movie but it does not romanticize that brutality which I found refreshing.There were a few things I did not like about the movie. I thought the pacing seemed weird in some places but, all in all, I thought the filmmakers did a good job adapting a strange and disturbing novel into a strange and disturbing movie.

If you do not like violence in movies, you will probably hate this movie.Casey Affleck plays a 1950s deputy sheriff in a small Texas town, who seems the soul of amiability and helpfulness to the citizens of that town.  He doesn't even carry a gun. He is immaculately groomed with his white shirts starched perfection as he goes about his duties. He is careful when he erupts into a killing machine of exceptional brutality to never muss his impeccable grooming in the slightest. He is especially efficient at killing women with his gloved hands or his shod feet.  His is an amazing performance as he manages to suggest that killer on the inside throughout every frame of the movie even though it is at such odds with his deputy sheriff persona.  Most of the time he is clothed in that persona and is non violent. To be able to suggest the violence inside throughout the film even when being the most amiable and serene, is quite an acting feat.  This entirely fits Tompson's novel too.His victims never see his violence coming.  They've known him for years and,  if anything, thought him overly mild and easy going. From what we know now of these personality types, half a century after Thompson wrote about them, this is spot on.I am not a Ben Affleck as leading man fan although I like the job he did of directing Casey in GONE BABY GONE. So I would have to agree with many others that Casey is the Affleck brother to watch as an actor.Jim Thompson, who wrote the source novel for this film, was one of the all time greats when it came to American Noir crime fiction.  When you discover he was writing it back in the 1950s, you realize he is the one being copied today in the plethora of serial killer novels. He might be viewed as one of the ""fathers"" of hard boiled crime with sociopath lead characters.I suspect Jim Thompson would have loved Casey Affleck.  Here finally was an American bringing one of his all time most loathsome characters to life.  This is because Thompson was mainly discovered in Europe in his own time, not in his own country.  When I first saw a Thompson novel adapted to movies it was a French film set in Africa, although Thompson's source novel had been set in America, as usual.",5,Captures the Novel Perfectly BUT Very Violent,1282348800,"08 21, 2010",2010,2251,"['Caution', 'very', 'violent', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'violence', 'movies', 'will', 'probably', 'hate', 'movie.Casey', 'Affleck', '1950s', 'deputy', 'sheriff', 'small', 'Texas', 'town', 'who', 'soul', 'amiability', 'helpfulness', 'citizens', 'town', ""n't"", 'even', 'carry', 'gun', 'immaculately', 'groomed', 'white', 'shirts', 'starched', 'perfection', 'duties', 'careful', 'when', 'killing', 'machine', 'exceptional', 'brutality', 'never', 'muss', 'impeccable', 'grooming', 'slightest', 'especially', 'efficient', 'killing', 'women', 'gloved', 'hands', 'shod', 'feet', 'amazing', 'performance', 'suggest', 'killer', 'inside', 'frame', 'movie', 'even', 'such', 'odds', 'deputy', 'sheriff', 'persona', 'Most', 'time', 'clothed', 'persona', 'non', 'violent', 'be', 'able', 'suggest', 'violence', 'film', 'even', 'when', 'being', 'most', 'amiable', 'serene', 'quite', 'acting', 'feat', 'entirely', 'Tompson', 'novel', 'too.His', 'victims', 'never', 'see', 'violence', 'coming', ""'ve"", 'known', 'years', 'anything', 'thought', 'overly', 'mild', 'easy', 'going', 'what', 'know', 'now', 'personality', 'types', 'century', 'Thompson', 'wrote', 'spot', 'on.I', 'am', 'not', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'leading', 'man', 'fan', 'like', 'job', 'did', 'directing', 'Casey', 'GONE', 'BABY', 'GONE', 'would', 'have', 'agree', 'many', 'others', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'brother', 'watch', 'actor.Jim', 'Thompson', 'who', 'wrote', 'source', 'novel', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'greats', 'when', 'came', 'American', 'Noir', 'crime', 'fiction', 'When', 'discover', 'was', 'writing', 'back', '1950s', 'realize', 'one', 'being', 'copied', 'today', 'plethora', 'serial', 'killer', 'novels', 'might', 'be', 'viewed', 'one', 'fathers', 'hard', 'boiled', 'crime', 'sociopath', 'lead', 'characters.I', 'suspect', 'Jim', 'Thompson', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Here', 'finally', 'was', 'American', 'bringing', 'one', 'time', 'most', 'loathsome', 'characters', 'life', 'Thompson', 'was', 'mainly', 'discovered', 'Europe', 'own', 'time', 'not', 'own', 'country', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'Thompson', 'novel', 'adapted', 'movies', 'was', 'French', 'film', 'set', 'Africa', 'Thompson', 'source', 'novel', 'had', 'been', 'set', 'America', 'usual']",N/A

I hadn't looked at too many reviews of it and it sort of slipt under the radar. I've never really thought Jessica Alba was all that good of an actress, just a pretty face and after the last few films that Casey Affleck had done, I expected this movie would get more notoriety. But it didn't.Well, Jessica Alba was pretty good in this. Although I believe she still has a ways to go before I would call her a good actress, this was a step in the right direction doing something so intense and outside of her comfort zone.The movie was surprisingly engrossing and intense. I was involved in the film and enjoyed the chess match going on between the FBI and the murderer. Although some of the things the murderer did were so blatantly reckless, I would point them out and think, why aren't the FBI catching on to this. If the girl was beaten so badly that her face was caved in, then how did she shoot the guy in the head? Then the murderer slipt on his kitchen floor and had to chase one of his victims down the streets of town.I started to think that either he was the worst murderer in the history of crime or the FBI were the worst agents in the history of crime fighting until I got to the end of the film. This had to be, hands down, one of the worst finale's to a movie that I have ever seen. All of the unreal and blatantly ridiculous things that happened throughout the film, were no coincidence, because the ending was just the same. A ridiculous fire and a police officer who fires a shot THROUGH an innocent woman's back and why would they let her approach him anyway, knowing what he is.A strange movie that was at times engrossing and captivating and at the same time, irresponsibly handled by a team of filmmakers who didn't realize how ridiculous what they were doing would look to the audience.I give it 3 stars for the fact that the movie was mostly interesting, but was tempted to drop it to 2 stars, just for the ending that left me so unfulfilled and disappointed I was literally angry for wasting my time watching it.",3,WHAT A TERRIBLE ENDING can do to an otherwise GOOD movie,1286323200,"10 6, 2010",2010,2124,"['KILLER', 'INSIDE', 'ME', 'was', 'surprising', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'had', ""n't"", 'looked', 'too', 'many', 'reviews', 'sort', 'slipt', 'radar', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'thought', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'was', 'good', 'actress', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'last', 'few', 'films', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'had', 'done', 'expected', 'movie', 'would', 'get', 'more', 'notoriety', ""didn't.Well"", 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'believe', 'still', 'ways', 'go', 'would', 'call', 'good', 'actress', 'was', 'step', 'right', 'direction', 'doing', 'something', 'so', 'intense', 'outside', 'comfort', 'zone.The', 'movie', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'engrossing', 'intense', 'was', 'involved', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'chess', 'match', 'going', 'FBI', 'murderer', 'things', 'murderer', 'did', 'were', 'so', 'blatantly', 'reckless', 'would', 'point', 'out', 'think', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'FBI', 'catching', 'girl', 'was', 'beaten', 'so', 'badly', 'face', 'was', 'caved', 'then', 'how', 'did', 'shoot', 'guy', 'head', 'Then', 'murderer', 'slipt', 'kitchen', 'floor', 'had', 'chase', 'one', 'victims', 'down', 'streets', 'town.I', 'started', 'think', 'was', 'worst', 'murderer', 'history', 'crime', 'FBI', 'were', 'worst', 'agents', 'history', 'crime', 'fighting', 'got', 'end', 'film', 'had', 'be', 'down', 'one', 'worst', 'finale', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'unreal', 'blatantly', 'ridiculous', 'things', 'happened', 'film', 'were', 'coincidence', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'same', 'ridiculous', 'fire', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'shot', 'innocent', 'woman', 'back', 'why', 'would', 'let', 'approach', 'anyway', 'knowing', 'what', 'strange', 'movie', 'was', 'times', 'engrossing', 'captivating', 'same', 'time', 'irresponsibly', 'handled', 'team', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'would', 'look', 'audience.I', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', 'mostly', 'interesting', 'was', 'tempted', 'drop', '2', 'stars', 'just', 'ending', 'left', 'so', 'unfulfilled', 'disappointed', 'was', 'literally', 'angry', 'wasting', 'time', 'watching']",N/A

I have wanted to see it because I truly enjoy Casey Affleck as an actor. I find him much more entertaining then his older brother, Ben, and much more appropriate infront of the camera. Right off the back the violence in this film is entirely valueless. Usually the viewer can catch the idea when a beating is about to take place, but never do we need to fully see someone recieve like 25 punches to a pretty face such as Jessica Alba's like they portray in this film. Another thing is, just because the movie is hard to understand doesn't mean it is intelligent. This applies for some films, such as The Fountain, Black Swan, A Clockwork Orange, and Taxi Driver. This film was far from intelligent and I'd say quite foolish. Both the main actresses in the film (Alba & Hudson) brought nothing to the table, just as many of the other pointless characters in the movie. The only character that wasn't completely a waist was Elias Koteas' character. I knew my girlfriend was getting fed up while watching this, as was I, but we stuck it out and finished it.

This certainly fits the description of Michael Winterbottom's film starring Casey Affleck in a stirring role as a West Texas lawman who, despite looking innocent, is a certifiably insane psychotic serial killer.Kate Hudson takes top billing in the lead female role, but ends up taking a back seat to the better looking and more talented--at least as far as this film goes--Jessica Alba.  Alba plays a fiesty prostitute who manages to bring out the savage beast in Affleck's character and thus sets him off on his path of reckless killing.  I won't discuss the plot more so I'm not accused of being a spoiler, but I'll just add that you might have to watch this one more than once to get all the details of the somewhat intricate plot.The three lead actors are supported aptly by several other talented players, including Elias Koteas, Ned Beatty and Bill Pullman.  But it's Affleck who steals the spotlight in his second role as a ""Ford""--this time however, it's Lou instead of Bob and, although he looks just as innocent this time around, he is much more sinister and deviant in his actions (verus the cowardly Bob Ford he played opposite Brad Pitt in the 2007 film about the assassination of Jesse James).""The Killer Inside Me"" may be too over the top for conservative viewers and/or audience members easily offended by aberrant sexual violence and behavior.

He's sadistic enough for it, but not smart enough--he makes mistakes, which lead to more mistakes, which lead to an explosive, apocalyptic ending.One thing is for sure: THE KILLER INSIDE ME is not for everyone.  The level of sex and violence in here startled me, and I am far from a prude.  It all works to a greater good--chronicling the depravity in Ford's mind--but it will definitely alienate potential audiences.  Those who tough it out will be witness to another stellar performance from Casey Affleck, one of the most nuanced actors of his day.  In their respective supporting roles, Ned Beatty, Kate Hudson, Elias Koteas, and Bill Pullman all shine; the rest of the cast, too, is surprisingly dedicated, something rare in film noir.  Michael Winterbottom's direction is top-notch; John Curran's script is hard-boiled enough to please fans of the genre; even the choice in music is inspired--classic country used to illustrate violence.  There's an irony there, somewhere.Ultimately, THE KILLER INSIDE ME is a solid entry in the film noir genre--decidedly rooted in the past, but with a modern emphasis that still resonates.

Joseph,"[6, 11]","I don't like to write reviews about movies too often because I watch so many movies, and I don't usually have anything new to add to the discussion that someone else didn't already point out.  Also, I usually forget the title and other details of a movie a few days after I've scene it, there are so many throw away films. But, I feel compelled to write a review for this movie, maybe for therapeutic reasons.I settled in to watch this movie only knowing that it was a movie about a killer and starred Casey Affleck, Jessica Alba and Kate Hudson.  Started out fine, period piece about the 40s, whatever. Then, Jessica Alba's prostitute character is introduced....and she starts to slap Casey Affleck repeatedly out of frustration, as he is trying to run her out of town.  Ok, fine, whatever.  Then they quickly ascend into a kinky S & M relationship...Ok, fine whatever!***Spoiler Alert***Then J.A. and C.A. cook up a plan to bamboozle a rich local to secure financial freedom...the plan is set in motion, then C.A. goes over to J.A.'s house and, out of nowhere, literally BEATS her to death with his fists, by punching her repeatedly in the face.  It is so violent and graphic that I wanted to vomit. In thinking about it, I guess it's not watching someone get punched to death alone that is so disturbing..there are so many violent movies out there....I think what made it so sickening is that she just sat there and let him do it, she was so deep into the whole S & M psychological thing that she is almost adoring him while he punches her over and over in the face.  It is just bone chilling and wrong.  It is truly misogynistic.C.A. later uses similar treatment on Kate Hudson, though to a lesser degree.  Throughout the film, there are flashbacks to C.A.'s youth in which a young woman, presumably his mother, sexually abuses him.  They also show him as a youth terrorizing and abusing young girls.  Quite disgusting. I feel kind of dismayed that I found the overall movie so compelling and suspenseful, in spite of my natural instinct to despise it.  However, the ending truly stunk and was quite far fetched.  As C.A. knows the jig is up and he is backed into a corner, he douses his whole house with gasoline and awaits the arrival of the feds.  Well, the feds show up and none of them seem to catch a whiff of the gas...subsequently, when they go to shoot C.A., the house bursts into explosive flames.  Oh yeah, but not before he kills Jessica Alba a SECOND time.

I know one critic described it as: ""Little more than torture porn tricked out in art-house finery.""  I would be inclined to agree with that assessment except for Casey Affleck's amazing performance.  The film is very brutal and the violence is hard to tolerate because it's so real.  I almost wonder if the violence was deliberately planned to be so over-the-top repellant to detract from the weak spots in the story.  None of what Lou Ford does makes sense.  Flashbacks seem to tell us he has ""mommy issues"" and that Joyce seems to bring his sociopathic nature out.  At least, that's the thin explanation given for his behavior.  How does this small town manage to turn out so many kinksters? What really makes no sense is the bumbling behavior of the other law enforcers in this small town.  They are suspicious of Lou, but they leave him alone in a cell with a potential witness?  No one warns ""nice girl"" Amy of their suspicions?  The ultimate victim, poor Joyce manages to survive and they thrust her right at her attempted killer?  Holy dumb cops?  Or were the 1950's just that innocent?I felt violated and abused after watching this. My husband actually got up and left the room because he couldn't stand the abuse heaped on sweet Jessica Alba. Certainly, I felt misled after reading the DVD cover. There is nothing erotic, exciting, or thrilling here. There are some stellar performances and it's an excellent period piece for the 1950's in terms of the sets, clothes, hairstyles, music, etc. It's a very stylish, noir type movie, but it's also very brutal to watch.Be warned!",3,Beware!,1302393600,"04 10, 2011",2011,1656,"['**Warning', 'lot', 'spoilers', 'ahead**I', ""'m"", 'very', 'conflicted', 'one', 'know', 'one', 'critic', 'described', 'Little', 'more', 'torture', 'porn', 'tricked', 'out', 'art-house', 'finery', 'would', 'be', 'inclined', 'agree', 'assessment', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'amazing', 'performance', 'film', 'very', 'brutal', 'violence', 'hard', 'tolerate', 'so', 'real', 'almost', 'wonder', 'violence', 'was', 'deliberately', 'planned', 'be', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'repellant', 'detract', 'weak', 'spots', 'story', 'None', 'what', 'Lou', 'Ford', 'sense', 'Flashbacks', 'seem', 'tell', 'mommy', 'issues', 'Joyce', 'bring', 'sociopathic', 'nature', 'out', 'least', 'thin', 'explanation', 'given', 'behavior', 'How', 'small', 'town', 'manage', 'turn', 'out', 'so', 'many', 'kinksters', 'What', 'really', 'sense', 'bumbling', 'behavior', 'other', 'law', 'enforcers', 'small', 'town', 'are', 'suspicious', 'Lou', 'leave', 'alone', 'cell', 'potential', 'witness', 'one', 'nice', 'girl', 'Amy', 'suspicions', 'ultimate', 'victim', 'poor', 'Joyce', 'survive', 'thrust', 'right', 'attempted', 'killer', 'Holy', 'dumb', 'cops', 'were', '1950', 'just', 'innocent', 'felt', 'violated', 'abused', 'watching', 'husband', 'actually', 'got', 'up', 'left', 'room', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'abuse', 'heaped', 'sweet', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'Certainly', 'felt', 'misled', 'reading', 'DVD', 'cover', 'nothing', 'erotic', 'exciting', 'thrilling', 'here', 'are', 'stellar', 'performances', 'excellent', 'period', 'piece', '1950', 'terms', 'sets', 'clothes', 'hairstyles', 'music', 'etc', 'very', 'stylish', 'noir', 'type', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'brutal', 'watch.Be', 'warned']",N/A

1363086,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003U6SJXQ,Grady Harp,"[15, 23]","THE KILLER INSIDE ME is so well made and headed for acclaim that encouraging the public to view this film is an obligation for those who have seen it early. The story is difficult for many reasons: the story if terrifyingly real in the manner in which it is related in the first person, and the grisly violence alone will make many a viewer cast down their eyes. Based on the novel by Jim Thompson, the screenplay is one of those singularly superb pieces of writing (by John Curran and director Michael Winterbottom) that adapts not only the novel's impact but also employs the lyrics of country western music and the slangy conversation of West Texas in a manner that completely recreates an atmosphere that makes the story even more compelling.Lou Ford (Casey Affleck, in a performance that shouts Oscar) is the town sheriff assisting the alcoholic and aging Sheriff Bob Maples (Tom Bower). Lou is a typically polite, courteous, gentlemanly 'good-ol'-boy', respected and admired by everyone in his podunk town. But there is something strange about Lou, something quietly dark that only is seen in his relationships with his girlfriend Amy (Kate Hudson): sadism is part of their physical moments. Lou is asked to run a prostitute out of town, a young girl Joyce (Jessica Alba) who lives in a small house on the outskirts of town where she quietly services the 'reputable men' - one of whom is Elmer Conway (Jay R Ferguson), an old schoolmate of Lou's who is inheriting his wealthy father Chester Conway's (Ned Beatty) mammoth construction business. Lou visits Joyce and despite some turns of sadistic behavior bonds with her and begins to see her on a regular basis. When the elder Conway wants Lou to help rid the town (and his son's reputation) of Joyce, a blackmail scheme ensues that leads to dire circumstances. Lou's 'killer inside' comes out and he calmly murders both Joyce and Elmer and then finds ways to cover the incident. He makes some errors in judgment that involve an old friend Johnnie Pappas (Liam Aiken) and a bum on the street (Brent Briscoe) and talks too much with labor union leader Joe Rothman (Elias Koteas) until his involvement is questioned by an investigator (Simon Baker). His home life with Amy is strained and Amy's presence begins to get in the way of Lou's sadistic behavior breaks until the entire situation becomes a crisis that ends in a bizarre manner.Casey Affleck embodies the dark aspects of Lou with a completely realized portrayal: despite his crimes we stay with him, much the way the townsfolk do. His is one of those performances that stays with the viewer long after the film is over. The exceptional cast is excellent down to the smallest role. Director Winterbottom gives us a West Texas atmosphere that is pure dust and heat and midwestern politeness and ritual. He adds some elements to the story that make the character of Lou even more unreal: often in Lou's moments alone in his house the background music is classical music - Mahler's Symphony No. 2 (Resurrection) and Strauss's haunting 'Four Last Songs' (as sung by Elizabeth Schwarzkopf I believe). It is a magical touch with another world outside the confines of the story.Though many viewers may find the degree of physical violence severely disturbing, the manner in which it happens makes Lou's dark side more credible and allows us to believe the ending. It is a difficult film, but it is one of the finer films of the year.

1363089,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B003U6SJXQ,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[6, 11]","Jim Thompson is one of the greatest writers to have ever lived. His works, such as THE GRIFTERS, A SWELL-LOOKING BABE, THE NOTHING MAN, SAVAGE NIGHT, and POP. 1280 are brilliant works, not only as 'pulp' fiction, but in the opus of all fiction (Personally, my favorite work of his is A HELL OF A WOMAN). And some of his works have been translated extremely well to the screen, such as Stephen Frears' THE GRIFTERS, James Foley's AFTER DARK, MY SWEET and Sam Peckinpah's THE GETAWAY, not to mention Thompson's own forays into film as he co-wrote two of Stanley Kubrick's early masterpieces THE KILLING and PATHS OF GLORY. What is generally considered to be his best work is THE KILLER INSIDE ME. It is a frightening and intense novel about one man and his unflinching, totally amoral attitude toward eliminating anyone who stands in his way of what he wants. It's pure Thompson.And if the film had fulfilled the promise of this book, it would have been brilliant. However, it does not.Now, let me begin with what works about this film, and it really boils down to two things: the translation of the book to the screen in a literal sense is pretty great. But the very best thing about this film is Casey Affleck as Deputy Lou Ford. Affleck is absolutely compelling, chilling and believable. His performance never hits a false note. Also the musical cues work very well.Where the film doesn't work is in the peripheral performances and the direction. Michael Winterbottom is a risk-taking filmmaker, but that's about all. Obviously he's pushed the envelope before with 9 SONGS, a film that features two actors spending most of their time having unsimulated sex intercut with live performances of independent bands. Aside from it's taboo-breaking content, it is an extremely boring film. Also THE CLAIM, with Wes Bentley, Peter Mullan and Milla Jovovich, even with its epic scope, is also a very forgettable and dull film despite the talent involved. So when I heard that Winterbottom was directing THE KILLER INSIDE ME, I was hopeful but cautious. And as I watched the film, I found that my caution was warranted. He manages to make some of the most intense moments seem stale. Either his direction is too staccato or too stagnant. The flashbacks are too frequent and too visually disorienting. The action of the film is obviously not something that should be shot in a Michael Bay kind of style, but it's just done with no real flare. And I guess that's Winterbottom's biggest problem. He seems to have no real style. He just points and shoots.The performances, other than Affleck, are passing at best and abysmal at worst. I find it extremely difficult to believe that anyone out there thinks that Jessica Alba is anything other than a pretty face. And she IS beautiful, but she is a terrible, terrible actress. Kate Hudson also looks gorgeous in this film, but suffers from perpetual boredom. Her performance is just far too bland. Simon Baker does exactly what his character calls for: be smarmy. And that's all you get from him. I can't even remember Bill Pullman in the film, to be honest. I know he was in it, but I can't remember what he did. The only other standout member of this cast is Elias Koteas, who is great in just about everything.Part of the forgettable nature of the performances could be attributed to Affleck's powerhouse performance, but the rest seem to suffer from somnambulism. It's not so much that they're bad... it's worse. I know that these people can do better (with the exception of Alba... she's never going to get any better), and that makes the experience more frustrating.Going back to Winterbottom and his risk-taking for a moment, the most controversial incidents in this film are its moments of sheer brutality against women. Obviously it's an important part of the book and the story, but the necessity to show it on-screen, while being very impacting, could have been moreso if only some of it was shown. Very few filmmakers have taken a cue from Hitchcock in the ""Less you see, the more powerful it is"" school of filmmaking. I'm certainly not speaking from a 'puritanical' point of view (Hell, if I was puritanical, I wouldn't like any of Thompson's work), but just that it seems to put the violence very much in our faces the same way 9 SONGS put the sex in our faces: Shock Value. And that just doesn't cut it for me.The film does give everything that a Thompson adaptation should have: sex, death, brutality, smoking, booze, drugs, amorality, incest. But THE KILLER INSIDE ME doesn't have what a Thompson adaptation DEMANDS: a film packed with compelling performances to make his wonderful prose sparkle; stylish, dynamic direction to give his descriptive talents more gravity; and an utter feeling of nihilism that leaves you feeling like you've been bashed in the belly with a baseball bat.While I barely recommend this film, I DO actually recommend it because of Affleck. It's another of his performances that demands recognition and acclaim, but the rest of the film is ultimately unsatisfying. If you're looking for a great Thompson film, please revisit THE GRIFTERS or AFTER DARK, MY SWEET. Aside from the afore-mentioned films, others to look at are THIS WORLD, THEN THE FIREWORKS or HIT ME (an adaptation of A SWELL-LOOKING BABE starring Koteas again) or if you can find it, the Tom Cruise-directed episode of the sadly short-lived Showtime series FALLEN ANGELS called ""The Frightening Frammis"".",3,"Affleck is great, but Winterbottom is off-key.",1278720000,"07 10,

1363093,AWN6ZMWWMUWLX,B003U6SJXQ,J. Friday,"[1, 2]","This film is about a deputy sheriff in a small Texas town whose lust for violence overrides his sense of morality. This film did a good job with the setting. 50s Texas with a good ole boy feel. I've lived in Texas and the cinematography for this film was so good it reminded me of Texas and I started to sweat. Seriously. The town is quite cliquish where everybody knows everybody and there's one bigshot businessman who runs the show. He's got influence in every nook and cranny. Despite the fact that this was set in the 50s, that type of environment still exists in Texas today.I thought the directing was good. I've been watching a lot of movies with camera-shaking, excessive darkness, unnecessary and off-beat camera angles, and shoddy workmanship. The directing in this paced itself slowly like a Texas drifter. It's got the old-fashioned country music. The acting was quite good. The characters weren't stereotypical rednecks. Instead they were just southern folk and the actors fit into those roles smoothly. The editor did a good job making the pace steady but not slow or plodding. And, like I said, I enjoyed the cinematography. My only complaint was the movie spent too much time on the main character. I felt the other characters should have been explored more. That's why I took off one star. At times it felt too one-dimensional, as if the world existed in the main character's mind and no place else. I'd recommend this movie for fans of noir. It takes place in a place other than the LA. Plus, it's not trying too hard to be cool. It's just trying to tell the tale of a psycho.*spoilers*This movie generated controversy because it depicted two women getting beat up. Out of the 109 minutes of this film, less than 9 minutes features women getting beat up. But this movie has been labeled misogynist, nevertheless. I wouldn't say this film is misogynist. Nor would I say the main character, who beats up the women, is misogynist. He's sadistic. Here's one thing I noticed: horror movies made within the last 30 years have had women as the main or only victims. You will see them violently mutilated in the most horrible way imaginable (in fact, many of the female victims are little girls, pre-teens). No one bats an eye at this. But two women are beaten up in this flick and this gets the misogynist label. Not horror films.

How much is your public persona the very same being you harbor when no one else is around? Or does the mere presence of a particular other person urge the Shadow Self to declare itself? (Shadow: Jung's definition of the dark side.)Casey Affleck is the title character and plays it with absolute conviction. Was it difficult for him to go home after a day's shoot and return to normal life? I wonder now what is normal for an actor who inhabits a character like Lou Ford, for this character and his actions made me sick. Note: I am not equating Affleck with Ford, but his stellar performance IS perfection.I was flipping through movie choices when at the very bottom of Direct TV's lineup, normally where the pornographic movies are listed, when I spotted this title and quickly rented it, remembering Kate Hudson's provocative, promotional interview on the David Letterman Show. Fairly soon I discovered why the movie was placed there--inappropriately, I might add. It has sado-masochistic, graphically violent content. Sickening content. Even so, for those who find fascination with the mind of a serial killer, there is an informative slant here.To what ends? What was the director's intent? Michael Winterbottom directs this film noir with an unflinching eye for veracity and sadistic boldness. He leaves some things to imagination, but shows the circuitous route to self-destruction when a person loses hold on moral turpitude. He also shows what could be way down deep inside, idling, waiting to come out, as it is in Ford. He also wisely shows the cause of that monster inside.The people in this 1950s West Texas town all know each other and have for years. Lou Ford is one of its favored boys, all grown up and now deputy sheriff. In fact, Affleck's very physical presence is a straight arrow--tidy, neatly done out, hiding even the boy he was. For little did anyone know what he and his older sister did for fun. These memories serve as the trigger to his nihilistic, dead-end behavior that rises from his assignment to chase the beautiful young prostitute (Jessica Alba) out of town. Instead, he connects psychically and sexually with her, opening the door to his hellish personality, the Shadow self, as Jung describes it.There is always that little door in one's mind that must remain closed and locked. To open it is to invite disaster, mild or torrential. Once that door is open, it can never be closed again. Lou Ford opens that door when she slaps him. Let me be blunt: Violence begets violence. In fact, violence is pretty much a character in this film.The number of murders good ol' boy, soft-spoken, loved-by-all Lou Ford commits from that point on is simply incredible. As with any deviant psycho personality, he believes he will continue his behavior undetected even though The Mentalist's Simon Baker is on to him. In the end he will be punished, but not the way the viewer may think or expect or want. Nor is the ending a good one. Just more shocking, horrifying aftermath.So, what is Winterbottom's purpose, other than producing a very stylish, well-made film noir?

1363096,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B003U6SJXQ,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[3, 6]","Casey Affleck is given a chance to show his acting chops and they are in fine form in this adaptation of Jim Thompson's book. Set in a small Texas town, Affleck plays a deputy whose calm exterior manner hides a much more complicated set of emotions. The movie underlines the deputy's background and unusual childhood. Many scenes are quite graphic, both sexually and in showing extreme violence. But the characterizations, setting, and the main story kept me riveted. There are strong supporting performances by Ned Beatty, Kate Hudson (nearly unrecognizable in brunette hair) and Bill Pullman (also someone I didn't recognize instantly).The basic plot? At first it seems like Affleck is going to be the hero of the film but take one prostitute (played well by Jessica Alba) who is supposed to be ""encouraged"" to leave town and the plot thickens. Affleck plays Lou Ford and he seems to have managed to hide his past well. But the prostitute manages to bring out his bottled up emotions and from there things grow quickly more violent and twisted. I found the psychological profile of Lou Ford to be understandable and felt that the reasons for his behavior were spelled out but a friend who saw the film with me was left wondering about Lou and his motivations.If you've seen films like ""A Simple Plan"" this one has a similar sense of actions which keep creating unexpected consequences. Affleck convincingly shows how Lou Ford keeps wanting to tie up all the loose ends and go back to ""normal"" life can't quite seem to manage it. His good guy demeanor hides the twisted personality of a sociopath although one could make the case that he is compassionate but trapped by his own inescapable desires, ones formed early in childhood. The sense of place and early 1950 Texas is compelling as well, rounding out an already fine film. Again, this won't be to everyone's taste and is a tough, gritty film.

Setting aside that he is a pitiful actor, his character was so insane that I was left speechless by his actions. Tying a woman down and beating the hell out of her the way he did made me very uncomfortable. I know it's not real, but stuff like that actually happens. It's one of those things that we know about, but ignore for our moral convenience. It's a natural reaction.This was a very intense movie, as well as depraved.

I won't say that this is a poorly done movie, but the subject matter is definitely hard core.

1363101,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003U6SJXQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Bringing pulp novelist Jim Thompson to screen has always been a tricky proposition. His dark stories are easy to push over the edge of sanity. With their undercurrent of brutality, they can walk the line of comedy and/or surrealism but still maintain a realistic punch to the jaw. Getting that tone has been hit or miss in cinema--personal favorites are the sublime ""The Grifters,"" ""Coup de Torchon"" and the underrated ""After Dark, My Sweet."" I was stoked to hear director Michael Winterbottom had taken on ""The Killer Inside Me"" which had been covered poorly in an earlier production featuring Stacy Keach.Winterbottom has assembled an impressive cast including Casey Affleck, Jessica Alba, Ned Beatty, and Kate Hudson for this neo-noir piece. Affleck stars as a low-keyed and likable law enforcement officer who gets involved with a local prostitute and enmeshed in a murderous scheme. But to cover his tracks, further bad deeds need to be done--and Affeck seems to relish this new evil! It's best not to go into the specifics of the plot and to let the film unfold, but Winterbottom does not shy away from some explicit and surprising violence. It's unsettling, to say the least, but helps to establish an effective ""anything can happen"" feel!Ultimately the success of ""The Killer Inside Me"" rests on Casey Affleck's shoulders. He is not the conventional actor one would picture for this role. Small in stature, relaxed in delivery (and enunciation)--his offbeat presence actually makes ""The Killer Inside Me"" even more intriguing. As he is not a predictable ""leading man"" or a particularly menacing presence, you're never quite sure what he's going to do. I found this lack of expectation to be quite invigorating and led me to accept and appreciate the twists of the film to a greater degree. To be fair, the film does get loopier and loopier--but I was happy to follow this sordid tale through to the completely over-the-top finale!

1363103,A356RFKNIG043B,B003U6SJXQ,K. Swanson,"[1, 1]","I would consider this a true noir classic if it didn't step outside the genre for a few really brutal scenes. Noir is NOT about graphic violence; just the opposite. It's about subtlety and suggestion. But TKIM is beautifully shot, well-paced and tightly scripted from Jim Thompson's nasty novel, and the acting is uniformly excellent. Yet I had to hit the mute button during one way over-the-top beating, and was disturbed by a couple other moments enough to close my eyes and shake my head. Not because I haven't seen graphic brutality before, but because this movie is otherwise so well-made and simply doesn't need the sickening violence to make its points. In fact, the brutality undermines them.I'm a huge fan of good noir, and have been recently disappointed by the many new pseduo-noir films of the past year. The only one that I found solid was Missing Person. TKIM is a better movie than that in almost every way, but for one huge detail: MP has what TKIM's director Winterbottom took away from this film---respect for the viewer. Truly great cinematic (and literary) noir has many distinguishing features, chief amongst them well-crafted subtlety which lets the viewer/reader fill in the blanks with his imagination, and thus become more invested in the story.This film takes the viewer far past that possibility at a few points, and shows horrific violence (and one short but terrible scene of incest/child rape) that quite honestly numbed me. And once the viewer is numb, no matter how crisply shot and acted the rest of the film is, the many details and tight moments that make up the best noir become almost moot. I was in fact both angry and sad about the director's choices here in those few brutal scenes. Why do we have to SEE these things? Truly great art implies the terrible without splashing it in our faces. Whereas b-movies and trash novels spell it all out for the visceral but cheap thrills. The rest of TKIM is above those scenes in most every way...but they were so harsh that I just couldn't accept them, a real loss considering how fine the rest of this film is.Affleck is excellent as Lou, very low-key in all the right ways, and he captures the spirit of small town Texas well, as does the quietly gorgeous cinematography. When we see him wander off into sinister realms, he still retains a likability, and that contrast is at the heart of the story. But it would have been so much more well-served if we'd not been forced to witness the beating and the rape. In this case, the wise move is to tell and not show, but the director forces us to watch these sickening scenes, and it lowers the whole tone of the experience. Sure, Thompson's book is very harsh, but the movie could have had much more emotional impact if it had portrayed the violence via shadows or through a gauzy curtain or frankly anything but what it does, which is just show it straight up. It takes away from Affleck's performance and makes the whole affair too cut and dried. Rarely have I felt so let down by a director's choices.Alba and Hudson are both very good, and Ned Beatty delivers yet another perfect turn; the man's career is on a par with Hackman, Duvall and a small handful of other legendary character actors. He belongs in a film like this, in the way that the harsh violence does not. He says a lot with very little. That's what the best noir is all about. If only the director had Beatty's restraint and eye for the telling moment. In fact, he often does, which makes the blunt nastiness all the more out of place and jarring. I liked most everything here except the nastiness, and would love to see a cut without it; that would be a truly classic film to my mind.The blu-ray is excellent, and its slightly hazy picture catches both the noir feel and the look of small-town Texas to a T. There are shots with translucent beauty to them, and I was reminded of both Cain and Hammett's writing at moments, more so than Thompson's, actually. They had a touch he did not. Cinematographer Zyskind also has that touch behind the camera here. But his director does him wrong on those few sickening scenes, and his subtlety is undercut by their jarring, long-lasting emotional echoes. Parmenter's score is similarly fine, never too flashy and oft perfect. Watching this on blu-ray was a real pleasure, and it's a fine transfer that leaves little to be desired.Sigh. Unlike the editing choices, and the loud thuds that go on and on during the beating. Do we really need to be put through this? No. Can't we be shown this man's evil without actually being shown his evil acts? Yes. But that would require a director with a little more taste and touch than Winterbottom, unfortunately.I'd heartily recommend this to all noir fans, with the obvious caveat: unless you revel in disgusting brutality, you might want to have the mute button close at hand early on, and be willing to turn your head away at moments. I had to, and I can usually stomach some brutal scenes if they are truly needed (they rarely are, and the best directors always find ways around them). Here they are not and the director does not, and what would have been a near-perfect, chilling portrait of a psychopath is instead a film with its own edge of sickness, an edge that dampens the artistry all around it.",4,"Lovely blu-ray picture of a very good but unlovely, graphically violent noir",1282608000,"08 24, 2010",2010,5287,"['would', 'consider', 'true', 'noir', 'classic', 'did',

1363104,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B003U6SJXQ,Lee Armstrong,"[10, 21]","With such a stunning cast, I expected a delightful film.  ""The Killer Inside Me"" is the polar opposite of delightful.  The subject matter of domestic violence against women is a sensitive one.  ""The Killer Inside Me"" beats it with a sledgehammer.  Truly, the brutal violence is reason enough to avoid this film.  Even more than that is the string of performances with excellent actors in a script that leaves little room for emotional variation.  Casey Affleck's Lou Ford -- an interesting twist since he played Robert Ford in his Oscar-nominated role -- is chillingly cold throughout the film.  He has a pleasant smile, but hardly seems a likely woman magnet.  Inexplicably, his edgy, almost violent, way of love making apparently causes Kate Hudson's Amy Stanton and Jessica Alba's Joyce Lakeland to love him until the end.  While both women do a good job, the screenplay doesn't allow for much depth.  This cartoon-like superficiality taints a welcome appearance by veteran actor Ned Beatty as the wealthy Chester Conway and Simon Baker's lawman Howard Hendricks.  Neither role allows for much variation.  Perhaps coming off best in the film is Elias Koteas as Joe Rothman who suspects Ford is a killer, but can't prove it.  I recently watched Koteas' performance inThe Thin Red Line (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray], and here he gives depth despite the script.  Also turning in a great performance is Liam Aiken as the young gas station attendant Johnnie Pappas who considers Ford his friend.  By the end of the film, I kept wondering, ""What's the point?""  It wasn't entertaining.  It did not make the most of the great talents working on the film.  I was unable to detect what motivated Ford.  By having a serial killer as the main character, it keeps the audience emotionally removed from the story.

Some cop in a small town is shown engaging in some dirt with some Bad Guy (this is the setup that gets us from the beginning to the first murder).2. Said cop also has a Hooker-Girlfriend with whom he can/ does get into fairly heavy S&M.;3. In some type of scheme gone wrong, he ends up beating the girlfriend to death (or so he thinks) and framing another guy for it.4. There are a series of 4-5 other murders (he has to murder the next person to cover up the last and so on). At one point, some cop shoots a guy on sight that Affleck says committed one of the murders.5. Everyone in this town suspects that he did murder those people, but it seems that they didn't have a forensics office in those days. So, he walks around for WEEKS in spite of it being common knowledge that he committed these murders.6. Finally, some unidentified guy comes and gets him out of jail/ the psychiatric ward (for four-- count them, four-- murders).7. He goes back to his house, where he puts gas on everything and pours liquor all over everything and waits for the police to come. (Somehow he knows that they are coming.)8. The police come into the house with the Hooker-Girlfriend that he thinks he killed (somehow he knew that he didn't kill her). He tells her that he loves her and stabs her to death. The police fire a gun (and a bullet hits the gas that they couldn't smell upon entering the house) and spark a fire that blows up (as in it was ammonium nitrate and not plain ol' gas that you could put in a lawnmower).9. Apparently the Hooker-Girlfriend didn't offer the police any information about the man that put her into a coma.The acting in this film was great. The casting was great (Casey Affleck does such a good job with roles of slimy/ sick characters). It's just that this went way past the limits of plausibility.

From the looks of the trailer I thought it had a chance to be a good movie. When I saw it this week I was not disappointed. I loved the way Casey Affleck played the main character, Lou Ford (the 'me' in the title) and it was very much how I remembered the book. I felt I had more sympathy for Affleck's portrayal of Lou Ford than I did when I had initially read the book. Despite the violence that really packs a punch (literally and proverbially), I could not help but feel for the character of Lou. I enjoyed very much the style the movie was made in, but it was Casey Affleck's portrayal of Lou Ford that haunted me.Since seeing the movie, I have been rereading the book and I was amazed at how faithful and successful the filmmakers were in adapting book to screen. With minimal changes, the movie captures the book very well. I would encourage anyone who liked this movie to read the book (and vice versa). I would think this would have to be one of the best adaptations of a novel to screen in recent years.I thought the melange of music that was in the movie worked very well, especially the vintage country tunes of the period. The original score is very effective; understated, sparse and subtle. It lends a touch of sadness to the movie that works nicely. Even the opera arias Lou listens to on the phonograph work well (even though I never thought of Lou as an opera buff), especially when the tune of one of them becomes something he plays on the piano. It all adds quite a melancholy touch.I recommend this movie. Maybe you will be haunted by Casey Affleck's portrayal of Lou Ford as I was. I thought it was all very well done and I found myself thinking on it afterwards. So much so that it had me reading the book again.

1363118,A387BD735MI50R,B003U6SJXQ,R. Schultz,"[10, 14]","This movie starts on a ""Blood Simple"" note. A narrator philosophically distances us from the action with a quiet reflection on what it means to be a Texas gentleman. This film continues to have echoes of ""Blood Simple,"" but it proceeds in a somewhat different direction. In this case, the narrator turns out to be the main character, so we don't remain distanced from the action for long. We're soon enough plummeted first-person into the horrible heart of his twisted code of conduct.Then whereas ""Blood Simple"" could almost be viewed as a comedy of errors, with everyone getting tripped and triggered at cross-purposes into bloody rejoinder - here the bloodshed is all the result of the one character's warping. The focus on the horror is so singular and intense that certainly all possibility of comedy is stripped from the scenes.It's this aspect of the movie that gave me pause. Could such a monster really walk among us? Surely the man is a sociopath, and as ""Criminal Minds/CSI"" shows have convinced us - sociopaths are rife. But are there sociopaths who commit their acts with as little motive as this man does? There were obviously easier ways for him to solve his problems than by committing the cruelties we see. Neither did his cruelty seem to be aimed at satisfying any lust, any need for power and control, or anything as slight as a hankering for a cheap thrill. There's even a moment when he seems to have a back-handed regret about what he's doing - when he leans over a victim and reassures her that her ordeal is ""almost over now."" So why is he doing it?And then I wondered if such women could exist who would really love such a person? The man is not physically prepossessing and doesn't seem to have any special charms other than his soothing southern drawl. He does say that he tried to be a good boyfriend for the relatively short time he spent with the women in his life. He congratulates himself on ""taking them places they wanted to go and to movies they wanted to see."" But is this enough to make women fall hopelessly in love with a man and to lend themselves to the full extent of his brutality with so little resistance? Or was this movie just an over-the-top misogynist's dream that wasn't telling me anything true about the world?But reflecting on it, considering this movie as more than just casual entertainment and taking it as serious sociology - I had to admit that such people DO exist. There are people who do what they do simply because, in Edmund Hillary's famous line, ""It was there."" And there are women who feel compelled to lend themselves to extremes of violence. Feminist Andrea Dworkin said that a woman proves her love by her willingness ""to be destroyed by the one whom she loves, for his sake."" Scenes in this movie provide graphic, gut-wrenching illustrations of that observation.Casey Affleck is riveting in his role. His quietude makes us lean in, in spite of ourselves, to catch his every intention. His calm, sinuous assurances, uttered even in the midst of his worst violence, will probably be etched in most of our memories. So when we are at our lowest ebb, in our darkest hour, we will, with a combination of false sympathy for ourselves and with a pepper spray of the sardonic, similarly reassure ourselves that ""it's almost over.""Coincidentally, close on the heels of ""The Killer Inside Me,"" I saw Affleck's portrayal of the man who shot Jesse James in the movie ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford."" (Affleck seems to be very specifically typecast into playing southern characters named ""Ford."") In ""Jesse James,"" Affleck uses exactly the same voice, the same soft slurry that he uses in ""The Killer Inside Me."" But there is a mirroring quality to his acting that reflects differently depending on the tint of the movie he's in. In ""Jesse James,"" his low-key elisions are just as engrossing, just as subtly premonitory of murder - but he nevertheless presents himself in a different cast. So you might want to make a Casey Affleck double feature of your evening, going from ""The Killer Inside Me"" to ""The Assassination of Jesse James,"" watching him as two types of killers - if you have the stomach to watch such back-to-back betrayal.",5,A Chilling Portrait of Pointless Cruelty,1287360000,"10 18, 2010",2010,4222,"['movie', 'Blood', 'Simple', 'note', 'narrator', 'philosophically', 'action', 'quiet', 'reflection', 'what', 'be', 'Texas', 'gentleman', 'film', 'have', 'echoes', 'Blood', 'Simple', 'somewhat', 'different', 'direction', 'case', 'narrator', 'out', 'be', 'main', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'remain', 'distanced', 'action', 'long', ""'re"", 'soon', 'enough', 'plummeted', 'first-person', 'horrible', 'heart', 'twisted', 'code', 'conduct.Then', 'Blood', 'Simple', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'viewed', 'comedy', 'errors', 'everyone', 'getting', 'tripped', 'triggered', 'cross-purposes', 'bloody', 'rejoinder', 'here', 'bloodshed', 'result', 'one', 'character', 'warping', 'focus', 'horror', 'so', 'singular', 'intense', 'certainly', 'possibility', 'comedy', 'stripped', 'scenes.It', 'aspect', 'movie', 'gave', 'pause', 'Could', 'monster', 'really', 'walk', 'Surely', 'man', 'sociopath', 'Criminal', 'Minds/CSI', 'shows', 'have', 'convinced', 'sociopaths', 'are', 'rife', 'are', 'there', 'sociopaths', 'who', 'commit', 'acts', 'as', 'little', 'motive', 'man', 'were', 'obviously', 'easier', 'ways', 'solve', 'problems', 'committing', 'cruelties', 'see', 'did', 'cruelty', 'seem', 'be', 'aimed', 'satisfying', 'lust', 'need', 'power', 'control', 'anything', 'as', 'slight', 'hankering', 'cheap', 'thrill', 'even', 'moment', 'when', 'have', 'back-handed', 'regret', 'what', 'doing', 'when', 'victim', 'ordeal', 'almost', 'now', 'So', 'why', 'doing', 'then', 'wondered', 'such', 'women', 'could', 'exist', 'who', 'would', 'really', 'love', 'person', 'man', 'not', 'physically', 'prepossessing', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'special', 'charms', 'other', 'soothing', 'southern', 'drawl', 'say', 'tried', 'be', 'good', 'boyfriend', 'relatively', 'short', 'time', 'spent', 'women', 'life', 'taking', 'places', 'wanted', 'go', 'movies', 'wanted', 'see', 'enough', 'make', 'women', 'fall', 'hopelessly', 'love', 'man', 'lend', 'full', 'extent', 'brutality', 'so', 'little', 'resistance', 'was', 'movie', 'just', 'over-the-top', 'misogynist', 'dream', 'was', ""n't"", 'telling', 'anything', 'true', 'world', 'reflecting', 'considering', 'movie', 'more', 'just', 'casual', 'entertainment', 'taking', 'serious', 'sociology', 'had', 'admit', 'such', 'people', 'DO', 'exist', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'simply', 'Edmund', 'Hillary', 'famous', 'line', 'was', 'there', 'are', 'women', 'who', 'feel', 'compelled', 'lend', 'extremes', 'violence', 'Feminist', 'Andrea', 'Dworkin', 'said', 'woman', 'love', 'willingness', 'be', 'destroyed', 'one', 'whom', 'sake', 'Scenes', 'movie', 'provide', 'graphic', 'gut-wrenching', 'illustrations', 'observation.Casey', 'Affleck', 'riveting', 'role', 'quietude', 'lean', 'spite', 'ourselves', 'catch', 'intention', 'calm', 'sinuous', 'assurances', 'uttered', 'even', 'midst', 'worst', 'violence', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'etched', 'most', 'memories', 'So', 'when', 'are', 'lowest', 'ebb', 'darkest', 'hour', 'will', 'combination', 'false', 'sympathy', 'ourselves', 'pepper', 'spray', 'sardonic', 'similarly', 'reassure', 'almost', 'Coincidentally', 'close', 'heels', 'Killer', 'Inside', 'Me', 'saw', 'Affleck', 'portrayal', 'man', 'who', 'Jesse', 'James', 'movie', 'Assassination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Coward', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'Affleck', 'be', 'very', 'specifically', 'typecast', 'playing', 'southern', 'characters', 'named', 'Ford', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Affleck', 'exactly', 'same', 'voice', 'same', 'soft', 'slurry', 'Killer', 'Inside', 'Me', 'mirroring', 'quality', 'acting', 'differently', 'depending', 'tint', 'movie', 'Jesse', 'James', 'low-key', 'elisions', 'are', 'just', 'engrossing', 'just', 'subtly', 'premonitory', 'murder', 'nevertheless', 'different', 'cast', 'might', 'want', 'make', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'double', 'feature', 'evening', 'going', 'Killer', 'Inside', 'Me', 'Assassination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'watching', 'two', 'types', 'killers', 'have', 'stomach', 'watch', 'such', 'back-to-back', 'betrayal']",N/A

1363124,A27MOT4ZIUAKIW,B003U6SJXQ,The Jaundiced Eye,"[70, 78]","For those who have not seen the movie, please read other reviews for plot synopses and be advised that the violence depicted is so graphic and realistic that no immature person should be allowed to view it. For mature viewers, the plot and dialog are reminiscent of Cormack McCarthy's work (i.e. Child of God) in which the psyche of a deranged, perverted lunatic is presented so dispassionately that you actually develop some (albeit minor) affection for him. It is a significant movie and definitely worth watching.SPOILER ALERT: My review is for those who have seen the movie and are puzzled or disappointed by portions of it, primarily the ending. For ease of recognition, I will use the actor's names, rather than their character names.Casey's mother died when he was quite young and he was introduced to sadomasochistic sex by a baby sitter. As a result, he begins molesting girls much younger than himself and is caught in the act by his adopted older brother, who is revolted by his behavior. Subsequently, when knowledge of Casey's crimes become wide spread, his innocent brother, being older, is punished while he is not. When the brother returns (from jail?) he begins working on a construction crew and is killed through the negligence of construction magnate, Ned Beatty. All of this is sublimated within Casey's mind until the nightmare is awakened when prostitute, Jessica Alba, slaps him. She ""becomes"" the baby sitter and they rekindle the violent SM relationship from his past, but now Casey is a grown man and capable of handing out a much greater, escalating, level of violence.Casey beats Jessica to death in order to conceal the murder of Beatty's son and thus avenge his step-brother's death. He is also symbolically punishing/destroying the source of his torment and pathology, the baby sitter whom Jessica has come to represent. His youthful experiences have rendered him a psychopath, devoid of conscience, and he is fixated upon immediate, personal whims, without concern for others. Violent murder is a logical progression in his awakened and rapidly escalating sadomasochistic fury. Watch how he covers the faces of both Jessica and Kate during sex, which is generally from behind, so he cannot see their faces. Is it so he can imagine that they are the baby sitter, or perhaps the child-victims of his youth? It's obvious that, in his mind, they represent other people and their faces contradict his mental images.I believe from this point forward, Casey descends into utter madness and his actions have no logic but to his own twisted psyche. His murder of Kate serves no purpose, because the ""purposes"" of an insane person are inscrutable. As with the prostitute, he and Kate have engaged in an escalating sadomasochistic sexual relationship and he probably realizes that marriage is not a desirable situation for him, so he simply ends it with a level of violence and detachment that are both shocking and entirely predictable. You don't talk your way out of an engagement to an annoying 'fly', you simply swat it....and then find a fall guy to take the blame.Now here is where I strongly differ with all other reviewers....the ending. Casey is caught and sent to an asylum, where he whiles away the hours in his cell supposedly watching a strange slide show of pictures of his victims. We are effectively told the slide show is imaginary by the reaction of the nurse when he asks her to slow down the progression of pictures. Watch her reaction. This is a critical and widely overlooked point: the slide show is entirely imaginary, as is everything from that point on. He is not ""saved"" from the asylum by Bill Pullman (which excuses his otherwise preposterous bellowing), and he does not really return home to plot and execute the destruction of all his adversaries. Jessica is dead. She does not walk into his house and verify her ""undying"" love, and his tormentors (inexplicably unaware of the gasoline-soaked house) are not all neatly incinerated. This is all a product of Casey's twisted imagination....a glorious, fiery ending rather than the grim reality that his future was really to be spent watching an endless, imaginary slide show on the wall of his dingy madhouse cell. The ending rubs people wrong because it defies 'normal' logic. It is, however, a preposterously, insanely perfect ending when you consider where it actually occurred....in the mind of a psychopath.",4,An Analysis that Differs Significantly from other Reviewers.....,1291507200,"12 5, 2010",2010,4413,"['who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'please', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'plot', 'synopses', 'be', 'advised', 'violence', 'depicted', 'so', 'graphic', 'realistic', 'immature', 'person', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'view', 'mature', 'viewers', 'plot', 'dialog', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'Cormack', 'McCarthy', 'work', 'i.e', 'Child', 'God', 'psyche', 'deranged', 'perverted', 'lunatic', 'presented', 'so', 'dispassionately', 'actually', 'develop', 'minor', 'affection', 'significant', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching.SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'review', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'are', 'puzzled', 'disappointed', 'portions', 'primarily', 'ending', 'ease', 'recognition', 'will', 'use', 'actor', 'names', 'rather', 'character', 'names.Casey', 'mother', 'died', 'when', 'was', 'quite', 'young', 'was', 'introduced', 'sadomasochistic', 'sex', 'baby', 'sitter', 'result', 'molesting', 'girls', 'much', 'younger', 'caught', 'act', 'adopted', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'revolted', 'behavior', 'Subsequently', 'when', 'knowledge', 'Casey', 'crimes', 'become', 'wide', 'spread', 'innocent', 'brother', 'being', 'older', 'punished', 'not', 'When', 'brother', 'returns', 'jail', 'working', 'construction', 'crew', 'killed', 'negligence', 'construction', 'magnate', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'sublimated', 'Casey', 'mind', 'nightmare', 'awakened', 'when', 'prostitute', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'becomes', 'baby', 'sitter', 'rekindle', 'violent', 'SM', 'relationship', 'past', 'now', 'Casey', 'grown', 'man', 'capable', 'handing', 'out', 'much', 'greater', 'escalating', 'level', 'violence.Casey', 'beats', 'Jessica', 'death', 'order', 'conceal', 'murder', 'Beatty', 'son', 'thus', 'avenge', 'step-brother', 'death', 'also', 'symbolically', 'punishing/destroying', 'source', 'torment', 'pathology', 'baby', 'sitter', 'whom', 'Jessica', 'come', 'represent', 'youthful', 'experiences', 'have', 'rendered', 'psychopath', 'devoid', 'conscience', 'fixated', 'immediate', 'personal', 'whims', 'concern', 'others', 'Violent', 'murder', 'logical', 'progression', 'awakened', 'rapidly', 'escalating', 'sadomasochistic', 'fury', 'Watch', 'how', 'Jessica', 'Kate', 'sex', 'generally', 'behind', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'can', 'imagine', 'are', 'baby', 'sitter', 'perhaps', 'child-victims', 'youth', 'obvious', 'mind', 'represent', 'other', 'people', 'contradict', 'mental', 'images.I', 'believe', 'point', 'forward', 'Casey', 'utter', 'madness', 'actions', 'have', 'logic', 'own', 'twisted', 'psyche', 'murder', 'Kate', 'purpose', 'purposes', 'insane', 'person', 'are', 'inscrutable', 'prostitute', 'Kate', 'have', 'engaged', 'escalating', 'sadomasochistic', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'probably', 'marriage', 'not', 'desirable', 'situation', 'simply', 'level', 'violence', 'detachment', 'are', 'shocking', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'way', 'engagement', 'annoying', ""'fly"", 'simply', 'swat', 'then', 'find', 'fall', 'guy', 'take', 'blame.Now', 'here', 'where', 'strongly', 'differ', 'other', 'reviewers', '.the', 'ending', 'Casey', 'caught', 'sent', 'asylum', 'where', 'away', 'hours', 'cell', 'supposedly', 'watching', 'strange', 'slide', 'show', 'pictures', 'victims', 'are', 'effectively', 'told', 'slide', 'show', 'imaginary', 'reaction', 'nurse', 'when', 'slow', 'down', 'progression', 'pictures', 'Watch', 'reaction', 'critical', 'widely', 'overlooked', 'point', 'slide', 'show', 'entirely', 'imaginary', 'everything', 'point', 'not', 'saved', 'asylum', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'otherwise', 'preposterous', 'bellowing', 'not', 'really', 'return', 'home', 'plot', 'execute', 'destruction', 'adversaries', 'Jessica', 'dead', 'not', 'walk', 'house', 'verify', 'undying', 'love', 'tormentors', 'inexplicably', 'unaware', 'gasoline-soaked', 'house', 'are', 'not', 'neatly', 'incinerated', 'product', 'Casey', 'twisted', 'imagination', '.a', 'glorious', 'fiery', 'ending', 'rather', 'grim', 'reality', 'future', 'was', 'really', 'be', 'spent', 'watching', 'endless', 'imaginary', 'slide', 'show', 'wall', 'dingy', 'madhouse', 'cell', 'ending', 'rubs', 'people', 'wrong', ""'normal"", 'logic', 'however', 'preposterously', 'insanely', 'perfect', 'ending', 'when', 'consider', 'where', 'actually', 'occurred', '.in', 'mind', 'psychopath']",N/A
1363125,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B003U6SJXQ,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[1, 3]","""The Killer Inside Me""  is a thriller about a Texas lawman with a deep secret.  Deputy sheriff Lou Ford (Casey Affleck) is a nice guy with the clean-cut image of a Boy Scout, but he has a deranged and dangerous side.  When his hard-drinking boss orders him to force a trouble-making prostitute out of their West Texas town, Lou faces a dilemma, since he himself is involved with the hooker, Joyce (Jessica Alba).  Joyce's angry reaction leads to a violent argument, causing Lou to cover up a crime and eliminate more and more people.  Be warned:  there is a great deal of violence in this R-rated movie.Director Michael Winterbottom uses disturbing, graphic imagery to underscore the depth of the deputy sheriff's psychosis.  Affleck's character is reminiscent of Hitchcock's Norman Bates, not in his use of violence, but in his Jekyll/Hyde life.  Lou can be gentle and easy-going to the unsuspecting, and as a man of the law, he knows how to cover up his crimes.  Excellent supporting performances are provided by Simon Baker as a big-city detective who comes to investigate, Ned Beatty as head of a local construction company, and Kate Hudson as the sheriff's fiancee.Three making-of extras feature Casey Affleck, Kate Hudson, and Jessica Alba.",4,Violent Look at Jekyll/Hyde Personality,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",2010,1246,"['Killer', 'Inside', 'Me', 'thriller', 'Texas', 'lawman', 'deep', 'secret', 'Deputy', 'sheriff', 'Lou', 'Ford', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'nice', 'guy', 'clean-cut', 'image', 'Boy', 'Scout', 'deranged', 'dangerous', 'side', 'When', 'hard-drinking', 'boss', 'orders', 'force', 'trouble-making', 'prostitute', 'West', 'Texas', 'town', 'Lou', 'dilemma', 'involved', 'hooker', 'Joyce', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'Joyce', 'angry', 'reaction', 'violent', 'argument', 'causing', 'Lou', 'cover', 'up', 'crime', 'eliminate', 'more', 'more', 'people', 'Be', 'warned', 'great', 'deal', 'violence', 'R-rated', 'movie.Director', 'Michael', 'Winterbottom', 'disturbing', 'graphic', 'imagery', 'underscore', 'depth', 'deputy', 'sheriff', 'psychosis', 'Affleck', 'character', 'reminiscent', 'Hitchcock', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'not', 'use', 'violence', 'Jekyll/Hyde', 'life', 'Lou', 'can', 'be', 'gentle', 'easy-going', 'unsuspecting', 'man', 'law', 'how', 'cover', 'up', 'crimes', 'Excellent', 'supporting', 'performances', 'are', 'provided', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'big-city', 'detective', 'who', 'investigate', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'head', 'local', 'construction', 'company', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'sheriff', 'fiancee.Three', 'making-of', 'extras', 'feature', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Jessica', 'Alba']",N/A

A bum on the street tries to blackmail him, so sweet Lou pummels his fianc&eacute; (Kate Hudson) to death in order to frame him. When a police investigator, who suspected the sheriff from the get-go, produces a recovering Joyce, Lou takes everyone down in a suicidal blaze.Affleck is quite convincing as the deranged, bad-seed-grown-up murderer although his soft-spoken drawl is often indiscernible. But the violence in this film is way, way, way over the top. I felt like I needed a shower after watching. Some stories are better left untold. Every reviewer who gave this misogynistic creepfest four or five stars should stop pulling wings off butterflies and immediately book some time with their local psychotherapist.",1,For all those who enjoy seeing Jessica Alba's face used as a punching bag,1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,1001,"['psychopath', 'Texas', 'sheriff', 'Lou', 'Ford', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'jollies', 'roughing', 'up', 'prostitute', 'girlfriend', 'Joyce', 'gorgeous', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'sex', 'then', 'brutally', 'mean', 'BRUTALLY', 'death', 'well', 'almost', 'attempt', 'stage', 'supposed', 'double-homicide', 'bum', 'street', 'tries', 'blackmail', 'so', 'sweet', 'Lou', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'death', 'order', 'frame', 'When', 'police', 'investigator', 'who', 'suspected', 'sheriff', 'get-go', 'recovering', 'Joyce', 'Lou', 'everyone', 'down', 'suicidal', 'blaze.Affleck', 'quite', 'convincing', 'deranged', 'bad-seed-grown-up', 'murderer', 'soft-spoken', 'drawl', 'often', 'indiscernible', 'violence', 'film', 'way', 'way', 'way', 'top', 'felt', 'needed', 'shower', 'watching', 'stories', 'are', 'better', 'left', 'untold', 'reviewer', 'who', 'gave', 'misogynistic', 'creepfest', 'four', 'five', 'stars', 'should', 'stop', 'pulling', 'wings', 'butterflies', 'immediately', 'book', 'time', 'local', 'psychotherapist']",N/A

1363128,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B003U6SJXQ,trebe,"[0, 0]","Based on a 1952 novel by Jim Thompson, The Killer Inside Me (2010) is a gritty tale of greed, betrayal, and murder, set in a small Texas town in the 1950&#8217;s, that features some strong acting performances, and is highlighted by several brutally violent acts against women, which are quite painful to watch.  Some major spoilers follow.Casey Affleck plays Lou Ford, a deputy sheriff, who although engaged to his girlfriend Amy (Kate Hudson), becomes romantically involved with Joyce Lakeland (Jessica Alba), a prostitute.  To save himself, Ford turns on the women who care about him, striking out with extreme violence that is both devastatingly cruel, and heartbreaking to watch.  The graphic way a face is shown literally being beaten to a pulp, is truly shocking and sickening.The movie becomes a succession of violent acts, which portray Ford as a cold hearted killer, with little regard for human life.  Casey Affleck delivers a riveting performance, and Jessica Alba is tremendous in a tragic role, that leaves you feeling emotionally drained.  The supporting cast that includes Elias Koteas, Ned Beatty, and Simon Baker, are also very solid.Michael Winterbottom&#8217;s film, the second screen adaptation of Thompson&#8217;s novel, is a dark tale with a mean sadistic streak, that some would regard as misogynistic.  While this version can be appreciated for its technical merits and gritty acting, it is far from a pleasant watch, and sadly may be an experience you may regret having.",3,"a punishing and powerful film, that you may regret watching&#8230;",1392768000,"02 19, 2014",2014,1495,"['Based', '1952', 'novel', 'Jim', 'Thompson', 'Killer', 'Inside', 'Me', '2010', 'gritty', 'tale', 'greed', 'betrayal', 'murder', 'set', 'small', 'Texas', 'town', '1950', '8217', 'strong', 'acting', 'performances', 'highlighted', 'several', 'brutally', 'violent', 'acts', 'women', 'are', 'quite', 'painful', 'watch', 'major', 'spoilers', 'follow.Casey', 'Affleck', 'Lou', 'Ford', 'deputy', 'sheriff', 'who', 'engaged', 'girlfriend', 'Amy', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Joyce', 'Lakeland', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'prostitute', 'save', 'Ford', 'women', 'who', 'care', 'striking', 'out', 'extreme', 'violence', 'devastatingly', 'cruel', 'heartbreaking', 'watch', 'graphic', 'way', 'face', 'shown', 'literally', 'being', 'beaten', 'pulp', 'truly', 'shocking', 'sickening.The', 'movie', 'succession', 'violent', 'acts', 'portray', 'Ford', 'cold', 'hearted', 'killer', 'little', 'regard', 'human', 'life', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'riveting', 'performance', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'tremendous', 'tragic', 'role', 'feeling', 'emotionally', 'drained', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'solid.Michael', 'Winterbottom', '8217', 'film', 'second', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'Thompson', '8217', 'novel', 'dark', 'tale', 'mean', 'sadistic', 'streak', 'would', 'regard', 'misogynistic', 'version', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'technical', 'merits', 'gritty', 'acting', 'far', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'sadly', 'may', 'be', 'experience', 'may', 'regret', 'having']",N/A
