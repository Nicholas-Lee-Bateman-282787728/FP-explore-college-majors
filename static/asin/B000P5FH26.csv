1068460,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B000P5FH26,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[6, 6]","What a lovely surprise this superb movie provided.Inga, a young German woman, arrives in Minnesota as a mail order bride to marry Olaf, a young Norwegian farmer. The time is the immediate aftermath of World War One and when the small community learns that Inga is German, they put obstacles in her path so that she and Olaf are unable to marry. She barely speaks English and Olaf is a man of very few words.This understated yet passionate and beautiful movie tells of how love slowly and quietly builds between the two and how they learn to appreciate one another, creating a common language that is almost wordless. How Inga sees Olaf's commitment to independence and justice extends to embrace his neighbor -- how Olaf sees Inga's strength of character and commitment to him and to his farm and to the land.Everything about this movie rang just right for me. The photography of the prairie, the big sky, the ducks migrating for the winter and an attractive cast of minor characters. The pace of the movie was just right. It gets under the skin and by the end, one is profoundly moved because there is a truth at the heart of this movie. I cannot recommend it too highly.",5,"A quiet and lovely movie, highly recommended",1273276800,"05 8, 2010",2010,1172,"['What', 'lovely', 'surprise', 'superb', 'movie', 'provided.Inga', 'young', 'German', 'woman', 'Minnesota', 'mail', 'order', 'bride', 'marry', 'Olaf', 'young', 'Norwegian', 'farmer', 'time', 'immediate', 'aftermath', 'World', 'War', 'One', 'when', 'small', 'community', 'Inga', 'German', 'put', 'obstacles', 'path', 'Olaf', 'are', 'unable', 'marry', 'barely', 'English', 'Olaf', 'man', 'very', 'few', 'words.This', 'understated', 'yet', 'passionate', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'tells', 'how', 'love', 'slowly', 'quietly', 'builds', 'two', 'how', 'learn', 'appreciate', 'one', 'creating', 'common', 'language', 'almost', 'wordless', 'How', 'Inga', 'Olaf', 'commitment', 'independence', 'justice', 'extends', 'embrace', 'neighbor', 'how', 'Olaf', 'Inga', 'strength', 'character', 'commitment', 'farm', 'land.Everything', 'movie', 'rang', 'just', 'right', 'photography', 'prairie', 'big', 'sky', 'ducks', 'migrating', 'winter', 'attractive', 'cast', 'minor', 'characters', 'pace', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'skin', 'end', 'one', 'profoundly', 'moved', 'truth', 'heart', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'too', 'highly']",N/A

Two foreigners want to get married in the 1920s US, but one of them is somewhat ""politically incorrect,"" being of German descent in post-WWI America.

If you have ever wanted to know what some people go through in their attempt to legal US immigration, this film is for you. As for the rest of the typical viewers, don't expect anything fancy or action-packed, not even a staggering romance. Life is pretty slow in the 1920s, and since the girl barely speaks English, it makes it even slower, funnier, and unforgettable. Anything else I say is a spoiler ;-) BTW, I give it 5 stars for performance and cinematography, and 4 for script. The story could have been told slightly different, without giving off everything from the very beginning. If you want more than what the screen shows, I highly recommend the novel:Sweet Land: New and Selected Stories.PS The girl with the gramophone is a great symbol of what she wants to bring into the foreign land with herself: music and happiness! I find this to be the producer's vision and motto throughout the whole movie. The girl's pure heart is reaching out to us beyond cultural differences and pseudo-political xenophobia, which seems to abide with us ""forever,"" no matter the fact that we call ourselves ""a country of immigrants"" (to quote JFK) and ""a melting pot"" (to quote all our primary school teachers).

Early on it is a bit slow moving, but once it changes time frames and Elizabeth Reaser (Inge Altenberg) is involved, it really gets good. Just Inge's use of English makes it worth watching. Reaser and Tim Guinee play off well against one another. Ned Beatty is excellent in his supporting role, as is Alex Kingston. One thing that could get in the way of enjoying this film for some is that at times it seems to start becoming a bit inclined to certain social agenda, though it does in some regards present both sides. There is also a point where some people might disagree with Inge's OR the reverend's take on religion, but I think those counterbalance each other well, and should not keep anyone from watching this otherwise great movie.

1068472,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000P5FH26,Ed Uyeshima,"[6, 7]","There was an obscure, misbegotten movie that Gene Hackman and Liv Ullmann made back in 1974,Zandy's Bride, about the evolving relationship between a roughhewn rancher and his Norwegian mail-order bride. First-time director-screenwriter Ali Selim takes a similar premise in his 2006 film but adds gravitas to the situation by adding a heartbreaking theme of intolerance, a multi-generational dimension and a beautiful tableau sense to its period imagery. The result is a most unusually elegiac, unhurried film, which fluidly goes back and forth between three points in time - 1920, 1968 and 2004 - chronicling the travails of the Torvik family and their neighbors on the Minnesota prairie.The focal character is Inge, who in 1920 is a young, vibrant German immigrant raised in Norway and sent to Minnesota to marry Olaf, a reticent Norwegian farmer. They face community resistance to their union, especially from the town's influential Lutheran minister, since WWI just ended with a palpable bitterness toward any German in their midst. In 1968, an aged Inge shares these memories with her grandson Lars upon Olaf's death, and then in 2004, upon Inge's death, a now-mature Lars must decide whether to keep the family farm or accept a lucrative offer on it. The 1920 passages hold the most interest because Selim pays meticulous attention to the details of rural life, including the harvest of an overwhelming corn crop and the enjoyment of a simple pie.Solid performances abound with Elizabeth Reaser providing a powerfully affecting turn as Inge, a sharp contrast to the modern-day commitment-phobe she played in Maria Maggenti'sPuccini for Beginners. Tim Guinee skillfully handles the more elliptical role of Olaf, although Alan Cumming and Alex Kingston steal their scenes as Olaf's animated man-child neighbor Frandsen and his fertile, grounded wife Brownie. Lois Smith makes her brief scenes count as the older Inge. David Tumblety's superb cinematography of the bucolic landscapes evokes N&eacute;stor Almendros' dazzling work in Terence Malick'sDays of Heaven. The 2007 DVD has a standard set of extras beginning with an insightful commentary track by Selim, editor James Stanger and producer Gil Bellows, along with stars Guinee and Reaser. There is a ten-minute, making-of featurette, ""Sweet Land: A Labor of Love Story"", pretty standard, as well as the original theatrical trailer.

It's a story of the immigrant experience and the prejudice that existed.  It's also a story of friendship and loyalty.  But at it's heart, it's a love story.  Inge, a young German woman who speaks only one or two words of English, has traveled across the world to marry a man she's never met, Olaf Torvik.Torvik is a shy, hard working farmer who barely speaks on their first meeting.

In the film, love triumphs over ignorance, prejudice, social hardships, and the other obstacles, not the last one, the difference in cultures and languages. German immigrant Inge (Lois Smith, a wonderful but rarely seen in the movies stage and TV actress) tells her life story to her grandson after burying her husband of 48 years on their farm in Minnesota in 1968. The story begins in 1920, when Inge (Elizabeth Reaser as Young Inge) just arrived to Minnesota as a mail-order bride to Norwegian-American farmer Olaf (Tim Guinee). Discovering that Inge is actually German, the community and its spiritual leader Minister Sorrensen refused to accept Inge as Olaf's wife echoing the anti-German propaganda in the country after WWI.

1068477,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000P5FH26,Grady Harp,"[87, 94]","Ali Selim is a gifted artist and one that surely will continue to create magical films such as his masterpiece SWEET LAND in the coming years. Selim wrote the screenplay based on Will Weaver's perfect little short story 'A Gravestone Made of Wheat', found the perfect setting for his tale of the trials of immigrants entering America searching for the American Dream in the spacious grandeur of Minnesota, and selected a cast to bring life to his story that simply could not be better. This film DESERVED to be considered among the best at the time of awards.Though the time of the story is 1920, the film opens much later in slow motion, only soft music comes from the soundtrack, yet the actors are mouthing words that make us realize we are witnessing the passing of someone important. When the characters begin to speak, the story of remembering what love and trials and experiences years ago were like, transporting us to a station house where we meet Inge (Elizabeth Reaser), a Norwegian/German girl who has come to America to marry a man she has never met, a man who will provide her with home, marriage, and a chance to start afresh. Her 'intended' is Olaf (Tim Guinee) who is shy and unsure of how to make Inge a part of his life: Inge's German background makes her suspect to the townsfolk who fear the course of Germany's power in WW I. Inge speaks no English but has been learning through a common phrase book. Olaf's friend Frandsen (a brilliant role for Alan Cumming), married to Brownie (Alex Kingston) with at least eight children already, helps Inge connect with Olaf. The intended marriage cannot take place with the minister (John Heard) because Inge can't speak English and because she is German... And there begins the trial that places Inge and Olaf in a home unmarried and fending for themselves.Through extraordinary acts of love bestowed upon Frandsen and Brownie (threatened with eviction from their farm) Inge and Olaf gain the respect of the townspeople and gradually are appreciated for the strong couple they are. They are married, and have children, and the story proceeds to the point where it started, where the aged Inge (now played with humility, grace and style by Lois Williams) carries on the integrity of the departed Olaf and brings closure to her family's disparities through her bonding to her grandson Lars (Patrick Heusinger and later Stephen Pelinski). Both Inge and Olaf wished to be buried in the soil of their land that raised the wheat that gave them material and spiritual sustenance. And it is done.There are numerous fine cameo roles portrayed by Ned Beatty, Paul Sand, Jodie Markell, Sage Kermes, Kirsten Frantzich, Stephen Yoakam, and Karen Landry. But the equal 'stars' of this breathtaking (and heart-taking) film are cinematographer David Tumblety and musical scoring by Thomas Lieberman and Mark Orton. The end credits are screen on the horizon of the farm with the young Inge and Olaf dancing, a touch that places Ali Selim in the ranks with the finest of filmmakers of the day. This is a brilliant, must-see film.

Wedekind ""Mr. Weekend""","[9, 9]","I'm not going to go into any great detail about SWEET LAND, which is also a very sweet movie, as previous reviewers here have done that already. I just wanted to add my opinion to the 50 others who have come before me.This was a simple story about two immigrants who grow to learn about and love each other despite the obstacles they have to overcome along the way. This was also an adult romance without any sex, violence, or four-letter-words...and not even one Ford Model-T was blown up...so I think that alone will turn off some people. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD, which we got free from our local library, and were involved in the story and cared about the characters. If that isn't the real test of a movie's entertainment value then I don't know what is. The main characters, Inge (a mail-order-bride from post-WWI Germany) and Olaf (a farmer from Norway), try to marry and begin a life for themselves in 1920 Minnesota but are thwarted by the parish minister, who refuses to marry them, and the townspeople, who still harbor anti-German feelings. It isn't until Olaf stands up to the town banker, who is intent on foreclosing the farm of neighbor and friend Frandsen, that the minds and hearts of the minister and townsfolk are changed.I think a few reviewers were less than enthusiastic about the movie because they either couldn't understand some of the dialogue (smatterings of Norwegian and German were spoken in the beginning) or thought it was just poorly accented jibberish. I guess they don't remember those old Folgers Coffee commercials starring Mrs. Olsen. ""Ja! It's mountain grown. The richest coffee there is."" otherwise they'd be less skeptical.At any rate, I wholeheartedly recommend SWEET LAND to anyone who can appreciate good acting, a believeable story, and beautiful cinematography.

They do not understand one another, but a ""love"" begins to form as the two daily work  together on the farm,in their community and to secure marriage papers.What happens here, as we learn, that in Norwegian there are two words for happiness: 'lydling' means overjoyed while 'glede' means delighted.This film, in essence, builds upon these two words in explaining a love that continues to grow into an affair of the heart, that is etched inside these two, despite consternation and opposition from outside.This is one of the most appropriately cast films I have ever had the pleasure to watch.Reaser and Guinee have such sweet and restrained fondness for each other that you are sucked into the vortex of their quiet longing.Cumming and Kingston are such the consummate pros as the best friends.They are the lighthearted characters that give the only support and strength to Inge and Olaf.John Heard, as Lutheran Pastor Sorrenson,plays the perfect blend of a man obliged to follow dogmatic Church teachings, and yet still believes in a God Who could possibly look the other way.The story easily drifts from the past, to a later period to the present day very fluidly and seamlessly with the help of veteran actress Lois Smith as the older Inge.This film has won so many awards for acting,screenplay and direction this year that it easily ranks as the top Indie film for 2007.It is a film of such grace and nuance that it will be an extreme pleasure to share this film with many for years to come. I believe this film to be absolutely appropriate for family viewing,especially if the children are not those who must have ""action"".It is an extremely intelligent and informing work on the then-existing Immigration laws concerning aliens and also the laws of women's Suffrage. Mostly though, I am reminded of a song by Peter,Paul and Mary whose refrain is:""Home is where the heart is,no matter where the heart lives."" Love is not a law;love is not a dogma....but love exists inside the heart where two agree.",5,Touched beyond the heart in SWEET LAND,1194480000,"11 8, 2007",2007,3304,"['WHAT', 'TRUE', 'BREATH', 'OF', 'FRESH', 'MINNESOTA', 'PLAINS', 'AIR', 'THIS', 'FILM', '2007', 'Independent', 'Spirit', 'Film', 'Year', 'best', 'MEMENTO', 'first', 'film', 'THE', 'NOTEBOOK', 'A', 'LOVE', 'DIVIDED', 'SOLOMON', 'AND', 'GAENOR', 'captured', 'sweet', 'unflappable', 'love', 'heart', 'where', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'concerned.Simply', 'put', 'SWEET', 'LAND', 'film', 'longings', 'heart', 'transcend', 'dogma', 'conventionality.In', '1919', 'Inge', 'Altenberg', 'Norway', 'Minnesota', 'mail', 'order', 'bride', 'Olaf', 'Torvik', 'Norwegian', 'farmer', 'now', 'nine', 'years', 'America.Inge', 'GREY', 'ANATOMY', 'Elizabeth', 'Reaser', 'obviously', 'woman', 'strong', 'character', 'will', 'have', 'made', 'trip.She', 'future', 'husband', 'Olaf', 'Tim', 'Guinee', 'LILY', 'DALE', 'best', 'friend', 'Franzen', 'truly', 'winning', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'wife', 'Brownie', 'equally', 'amazing', 'Alex', 'Kingston', 'one', 'problem', 'discovered', 'Inge', 'really', 'German', 'decent', 'WW1', 'still', 'palpable', 'Minnesotan', 'Lutheran', 'Community', 'just', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'risk', 'Inge', 'being', 'spy', 'midst', 'such', 'anti-German', 'as', 'well', 'Chinese', 'learn', 'sentiment', 'fledgling', 'America.So', 'Olaf', 'man', 'honor', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'Inge', 'be', 'cast', 'away', 'come', 'live', 'farm.She', 'sleeps', 'indoors', 'honorable', 'thing', 'do', 'sleeps', 'barn', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'one', 'love', 'form', 'two', 'daily', 'work', 'together', 'farm', 'community', 'secure', 'marriage', 'here', 'learn', 'Norwegian', 'are', 'two', 'words', 'happiness', ""'lydling"", 'means', 'overjoyed', ""'glede"", 'delighted.This', 'film', 'essence', 'two', 'words', 'explaining', 'love', 'grow', 'affair', 'heart', 'etched', 'two', 'consternation', 'opposition', 'outside.This', 'one', 'most', 'appropriately', 'cast', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'watch.Reaser', 'Guinee', 'have', 'such', 'sweet', 'restrained', 'fondness', 'other', 'are', 'sucked', 'vortex', 'quiet', 'longing.Cumming', 'Kingston', 'are', 'such', 'consummate', 'pros', 'best', 'friends.They', 'are', 'lighthearted', 'characters', 'give', 'only', 'support', 'strength', 'Inge', 'Olaf.John', 'Heard', 'Lutheran', 'Pastor', 'Sorrenson', 'perfect', 'blend', 'man', 'obliged', 'follow', 'dogmatic', 'Church', 'teachings', 'yet', 'still', 'God', 'Who', 'could', 'possibly', 'look', 'other', 'way.The', 'story', 'easily', 'past', 'later', 'period', 'present', 'day', 'very', 'fluidly', 'seamlessly', 'help', 'veteran', 'actress', 'Lois', 'Smith', 'older', 'Inge.This', 'film', 'won', 'so', 'many', 'awards', 'acting', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'year', 'easily', 'top', 'Indie', 'film', '2007.It', 'film', 'such', 'grace', 'nuance', 'will', 'be', 'extreme', 'pleasure', 'share', 'film', 'many', 'years', 'come', 'believe', 'film', 'be', 'absolutely', 'appropriate', 'family', 'viewing', 'especially', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'action', '.It', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'informing', 'work', 'then-existing', 'Immigration', 'laws', 'concerning', 'aliens', 'also', 'laws', 'women', 'Suffrage', 'Mostly', 'am', 'reminded', 'song', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'Mary', 'refrain', 'Home', 'where', 'heart', 'matter', 'where', 'heart', 'Love', 'not', 'law', 'not', 'dogma', '.but', 'love', 'exists', 'heart', 'where', 'two', 'agree']",N/A

Olaf Torvik (Tim Guinee) came to the US from Norway in 1910, moved west, cleared some land, and became a farmer. A decade later, his parents in Norway find him a wife. Inge Allenberg (Elizabeth Reaser) arrives by train with 2 suitcases and her indispensable phonograph. But Inge is a German national. Post-war sentiment toward Germans prevent the minister and judge from marrying the couple. Olaf is frustrated by the situation, but Inge is determined to be his wife.""Sweet Land"" director Ali Selim adapted the film from Will Weaver's short story ""A Gravestone Made of Wheat"". The story of Inge and Olaf provides an window on an American culture rarely seen in film. The farms' placid beauty defies the harsh realities of eking out a living in this fickle environment. I was entranced by the quietness that results from Olaf's laconic nature and Inge's inability to speak English. The actors do a splendid job of conveying Inge's resolve and Olaf's frustrated longing and fear of this stranger with few words. ""Sweet Land""'s framing device is awkward, but it does give the story context and leaves the audience satisfied to know how things turned out.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007): There is one featurette, a theatrical trailer (2  min), and an audio commentary. ""Sweet Land: A Labor of Love Story"" (11 min) interviews director Ali Selim about his intentions and talks with the cast about their characters and themes. The audio commentary is by writer/director Ali Selim, actors Tim Guinee and Elizabeth Reaser, editor James Stanger, and producer Gil Bellows. Selim and Stanger discuss the framing device. Selim talks about adapting the story. Also discussed are locations, the score, performances, shooting anecdotes, and the actors share their experiences.

There are beautiful shots of the Minnesota grain fields, rolling hills and the lone farmhouse sitting at the top.  The story is a flashback (of course) of a dying woman named Inge.  As her grown grandson says his final goodbyes, he remembers back to 1968 when as a teenager, she tells him how she came to America.  Most of the film recollects that time, shortly after World War I.  She was a mail-order bride believed to be coming from Norway.  Alas, she was from Germany.  The prejudice of the time was against Germans or anything with socialist in their political affiliation.  This caused problems getting her citizenship papers and without those, couldn't be married to Olaf.  He takes her in anyway despite the scorn of the community.  The story is not so much about the heartache of the times or the difficulty of farm work, but about the strength of character of the people.  Elizabeth Reaser is terrific as the younger Inge.  I remember her best from a short lived TV series called ""Saved"" and a story arc on ""Grey's Anatomy"" but she is pretty and a pretty good actress.  Tim Guinee is also good as her mate Olaf.  I'm not familiar with his work but he's damn good here.  The movie has its faults.  Where is the generation between the grandmother and the grandson? No mention.

As a ""love story"", it's very coy and constrained by the moral climate of the early 1900's (which it depicts).  As a sociological comment on the political undercurrents and prejudices of the period, it seems a bit wishy-washy, at first portraying stubborn narrow-minded behavior in the residents of the small Minnesota community, but then having the bigots ""come around"" to more kindly positions.Still, I fell for the charm of the movie.  It's a very pretty film on its limited scale.  Some of the film frames would stand up well as regionalist paintings.  There's a nice musical score, even if it seems a little redundant of other movies of the type, like ""The Straight Story"".Elizabeth Reaser is intriguing, even if she doesn't match Meryl Streep in the ability to mimic accents.  Alan Cumming once again makes the most of his talent for playing shy, clownish characters.  Ned Beatty and John Heard are two venerable actors, and their presences add a lot to the film.In summary, I feel that this is is a beautiful small film that suffers from a lack of substance.

1068498,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B000P5FH26,"Promise ""promise""","[1, 2]","This is a lovely tale of a farming community of Norwegian immigrants in Minnesota after WWI.  Olaf, a taciturn bachelor farmer, has been sent a bride, apparently from his people back in the old country.  She arrives, bright and beautiful, carrying a large grammophone with a huge bell speaker, and speaking no English.She's met by Olaf and his cheery friend, Fransen, whose joie de vivre makes up for Olaf's reticence. The director and screenwriter (whose name is strangely absent from the DVD case)said, in the short interview that accompanies the film, that he met Alan Cumming and wrote the Fransen character for him.  He almost steals every scene in which he appears and, as he is an amateur photographer who entertains his friends and family with his magic lantern shows, he may be a sort of alter-ego for the director.Fransen and his equally warm and lively wife, Brownie, bring Inge, the ""bride"" into their home and give her the welcome that poor shy Olaf can't quite manage.  There she must share sleeping quarters with the nine children, and finds herself dealing with feet in her face and worse....so she soon moves into Olaf's house with Olaf chastely sleeping in the barn.Despite Olaf's reticence he does notice Inge's undies which flap on the line and catches a glimpse of ankle atop her black laced boot. But it seems that it's her love of his farm animals that really wins her a place in in his heart!  Inge, a strong and stubborn woman, is committed to being his wife, even when she runs into the problem that she is German and is therefore held in grave suspicion by the community.The story is simple---how these two people eventually fall in love and build a life together, overcoming the problems that befall them.  Their relationship to the community is an important part of their lives; indeed one didn't survive without help from their neighbors in that time and place.The cast is excellent.  The two principles, Elizabeth Reaser and and Tim Guinee are both very good looking. This helps us because we spend a lot of time just looking at them; they don't speak much to each other.  Inge's background is a little confusing and the film doesn't spell it out. She is of German nationality but apparently was living in Norway. But she doesn't speak Norwegian to Olaf, who is also from Norway.  Apparently they've decided to speak only English, which seems unrealistic to me.The supporting cast is all great, too.  It was a treat to see the wonderful Paul Sand as the older Fransen.  And John Heard is always a pleasure to see.  His interpretation of the Lutheran minister is lovely; he toughly upholds what he believes are the standards of the community as well as shows a tender side.The cinematography is lush.  At times I thought it was almost too beautiful.  The farm house in which they live is pristinely white and the interiors are awfully pretty for such a socially backward Norwegian farmer.  I find it hard to believe that he would have chosen to paint one the rooms that lucious shade of tourquoise!  However, as the film maker states, this part of the story is Inge's tale, as she remembers it and relates it to her grandson many years later....so it may be colored by her memory.  And it makes for a very visually appealing film.I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in simple human stories, with no car chases, graphic sex or grisly crimes.  I found it especially interesting since my grandparents were Swedish immigrants in the Midwest.  This isn't a group of people we hear much about; they are not dramatic or flamboyant enough to attract much attention, but their quiet devotion to their ""Sweet Land"" and the folks who live on it, deserves much attention.",5,Sweet view of the lives of Norwegian immigrants in Minnesota,1322092800,"11 24, 2011",2011,3703,"['lovely', 'tale', 'farming', 'community', 'Norwegian', 'immigrants', 'Minnesota', 'WWI', 'Olaf', 'taciturn', 'bachelor', 'farmer', 'been', 'sent', 'bride', 'apparently', 'people', 'back', 'old', 'country', 'bright', 'beautiful', 'carrying', 'large', 'grammophone', 'huge', 'bell', 'speaker', 'speaking', 'English.She', 'met', 'Olaf', 'cheery', 'friend', 'Fransen', 'joie', 'vivre', 'up', 'Olaf', 'reticence', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'name', 'strangely', 'absent', 'DVD', 'case', 'said', 'short', 'interview', 'film', 'met', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'wrote', 'Fransen', 'character', 'almost', 'scene', 'amateur', 'photographer', 'who', 'friends', 'family', 'magic', 'lantern', 'shows', 'may', 'be', 'sort', 'alter-ego', 'director.Fransen', 'equally', 'warm', 'lively', 'wife', 'Brownie', 'bring', 'Inge', 'bride', 'home', 'give', 'welcome', 'poor', 'shy', 'Olaf', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'manage', 'must', 'share', 'sleeping', 'quarters', 'nine', 'children', 'dealing', 'feet', 'face', 'worse', 'soon', 'Olaf', 'house', 'Olaf', 'chastely', 'sleeping', 'barn.Despite', 'Olaf', 'reticence', 'notice', 'Inge', 'undies', 'flap', 'line', 'glimpse', 'ankle', 'black', 'laced', 'boot', 'love', 'farm', 'animals', 'really', 'place', 'heart', 'Inge', 'strong', 'stubborn', 'woman', 'committed', 'being', 'wife', 'even', 'when', 'problem', 'German', 'therefore', 'held', 'grave', 'suspicion', 'community.The', 'story', 'simple', '-how', 'two', 'people', 'eventually', 'fall', 'love', 'build', 'life', 'together', 'overcoming', 'problems', 'befall', 'relationship', 'community', 'important', 'part', 'lives', 'indeed', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'survive', 'help', 'neighbors', 'time', 'place.The', 'cast', 'excellent', 'two', 'principles', 'Elizabeth', 'Reaser', 'Tim', 'Guinee', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'looking', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'just', 'looking', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'much', 'other', 'Inge', 'background', 'little', 'confusing', 'film', ""n't"", 'spell', 'out', 'German', 'nationality', 'apparently', 'was', 'living', 'Norway', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Norwegian', 'Olaf', 'who', 'also', 'Norway', 'Apparently', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'speak', 'only', 'English', 'unrealistic', 'me.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'too', 'was', 'treat', 'see', 'wonderful', 'Paul', 'Sand', 'older', 'Fransen', 'John', 'Heard', 'always', 'pleasure', 'see', 'interpretation', 'Lutheran', 'minister', 'lovely', 'upholds', 'what', 'are', 'standards', 'community', 'as', 'well', 'shows', 'tender', 'side.The', 'cinematography', 'lush', 'times', 'thought', 'was', 'almost', 'too', 'beautiful', 'farm', 'house', 'live', 'pristinely', 'white', 'interiors', 'are', 'awfully', 'pretty', 'such', 'socially', 'backward', 'Norwegian', 'farmer', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'chosen', 'paint', 'one', 'rooms', 'lucious', 'shade', 'tourquoise', 'However', 'film', 'maker', 'part', 'story', 'Inge', 'tale', 'grandson', 'many', 'years', 'later', '.so', 'may', 'be', 'colored', 'memory', 'very', 'visually', 'appealing', 'film.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'simple', 'human', 'stories', 'car', 'chases', 'graphic', 'sex', 'grisly', 'crimes', 'found', 'especially', 'interesting', 'grandparents', 'were', 'Swedish', 'immigrants', 'Midwest', ""n't"", 'group', 'people', 'hear', 'much', 'are', 'not', 'dramatic', 'flamboyant', 'enough', 'attract', 'much', 'attention', 'quiet', 'devotion', 'Sweet', 'Land', 'folks', 'who', 'live', 'much', 'attention']",N/A

And this story begins anything but a love story.  At the time of her husband's funeral, Inge reflects on how they met and got married.  Inge was a bride from Europe who had arranged marriage in place with Olaf, a farmer of Norwegian descent living somewhere in the midwest.  What Olaf is not aware of is that Inge is really of German descent and shortly after WWI has ended, Germans are less than popular in his community.  What can this community do about a young woman with no family who has travelled across ocean to be married to a man she never saw before and who speaks not a word of English?  The obstacles that these two young people encounter are great, but they are not waivering under pressure. They both do what both know is right and over time they win the respect and trust from their community.  What started as possible arranged marriage or marriage of convenience grows into a love story of great proportions.  What I really liked about this story is that it is not just a love story.  It is also a critique of set of beliefs in America about what it means to be American, or German or Norwegian and how it related to simply being human and decent.  It has been ages since I have seen a love story like this one.

Her performance is pitch-perfect and she is a very striking woman as well.  And in a fair world, SWEET LAND would have been watched by more than half a dozen people.It's a familiar kind of story:  Reaser plays Inge, a young lady sent from Germany to Minnesota in the early 20th century to enter into an arranged marriage with Olaf, a young farmer originally from Norway.  Inge arrives, speaking perhaps 10 words of English and very little Norwegian.  Because the US has just finished up a war in which Germany was the enemy, the close-knit group of Norwegian farmers has a VERY difficult time accepting Inge as one of their own.  In fact, because her papers aren't satisfactorily n order, the young couple is unable to marry.  For awhile, Inge lives with Olaf's friend Frandsen (Alan Cumming), his wife (Alex Kingston) and their 9 or 10 children.  They are welcoming of their new friend, but Inge must share a bed with several kids and has no privacy at all at the communal bathtub.Olaf has barely spoken to his beautiful but frustrating bride-to-be Inge...but that changes when one early morning, she sneaks into his house to take a bath and falls asleep in the tub.  Their first unescorted time together is rather funny, but it leads Olaf to also realize that he brought a woman to the US to help him farm, and by golly, that's what they're going to do...especially when Inge forces the issue and starts to demand chores and to know the names of his animals.You can probably guess that a relationship blossoms between the two, but I must tell you that it is not reached via a familiar path.  Olaf is a good, sturdy man unused to speaking much...much less to women.  He is perplexed by this woman who has burst into his life, but has a grudging admiration too.  He doesn't so much feel bad for the hardships she endures, but sees her worth as a person and potential wife.  Inga, for her part, is willing to do her part in this arrangement, but she grows fond of Olaf in what is initially a merely friendly way.  I won't say they are like brother and sister...but to say that they are lovers without physical contact isn't quite right either.The film shows us their estrangement from the Norwegian community, who cannot accept this new German woman and her ""dangerous German ways"" into their midst...and Inge & Olaf suffer greatly for it.  And the film shows how a greedy banker (Ned Beatty) keeps the community in his debt, literally.  This is a terribly clich&eacute;d idea, yet it is handled in a manner to make it seem, if not new, then at least personal and particular enough to feel plausible.  There is a scene when a family farm is put on the auction block, and the unceremoniousness and cruelty of it are heart-wrenching...made more so by the fact that it is done with utter calm.In fact, most of SWEET LAND is calm.  Inge IS capable of convincing shows of stormy emotion...but mostly the characters are quiet and unassuming.  But this is not to say there is no passion.  There is a scene when Olaf admits to Inge, ""I know ducks dream.""  You'd never believe it reading it here, but that line is an emotional turning point for the film, a cry from the heart and a moment of quiet smoldering.The film is SLOW.  There are many lingering shots of the beautiful farm land (wheat and corn mostly) that are indulgent but stunning.  The sky is of most gorgeous blue and the grass of the most startling green.  I'd almost sworn I was looking at a Blu-Ray version of the film when I saw it on regular DVD...it's that saturated with color.The story is told as a very long flashback...and I should warn viewers that the first ten minutes or so, set roughly in our times, are slow going indeed.  Yet once we go back in time and meet Olaf & Inge, the film comes to lovely life.Tim Guinee plays Olaf.  He's an actor whose imdb biography has a rather impressively long list of credits, but frankly, the parts must have been small because I don't recognize him.  But he takes the clich&eacute;d character of the taciturn, early American farmer and imbues it with new life and a quiet manliness that is understated yet totally convincing.  And Elizabeth Reaser (enjoying fame currently as Esme in TWILIGHT) is stunning.  The camera loves her, and spends a lot of time in close-ups of her face.  We see the subtle plays of emotion there and it is very easy to find her completely convincing as a flesh-and-blood person we can easily care about.  The relationship between Inge and Olaf is one of the best film romances I've seen in a long, long time.  Alan Cummings, Alex Kingston, Paul Sands (in a small role, but it was good to see him again), Ned Beatty and John Heard provide solid support.It can be tricky to find this film from 2005, but it is HIGHLY worth the trouble.  While kids and teens would find the film crushingly slow-paced...I think adults with some patience will find themselves well rewarded.  When the story of Inge and Olaf ended, I was genuinely sorry to know that I would spend no more time with them.  See it!",5,A slow but lovely romance that is a meditation of love and land.

1068506,A3NP8P2PHBZABD,B000P5FH26,"Tidewater ""Whaler""","[5, 21]","Having just seen this movie on DVD, I ended up being puzzled about why it was made. I'm even more puzzled to discover that Ali Selim was born in Minneapolis, so the jarring inconsistencies in the script and visual parts of the movie make even less sense. I also must believe, based on this product, that children raised in Minneapolis, and who go on to schools there, live in a cocoon, a very liberal one, if the peans to Amnesty International and other do-good NGOs listed in the credits are to be believed.I had a Minnesota beauty for a girlfriend once, and she was the product of a German mother and Norwegian father. So far as I know, they got along fine. I find it hard to believe that among Lutherans in the state prior to, during, and after WW I, such strong anti-German sentiment abounded. I do know that German-Americans in the upper midwest, of which there were many, were as patriotic as Norwegians, Swedes, etc. I just could not get my arms around the blatant meanness displayed against a Norwegian-speaking German girl as set forth in the film.After all, in those days, the upper midwest, with its ferocious climate, was all about pulling together, cooperating, if you will, because if you didn't, you'd risk death. The make-believe, selfish, and sharply divided community depicted in the movie just didn't seem to pass the reality test. Also, the 40-ish happy housewife with her eleven children and relentless farm/home chores seemed unrealistically bright, healthy and vivacious. Who did the actual work around there? Both families' homes were painted movie-set bright white, sporting not only fresh paint but also ultra-clean farmyards. Olaf chopped some wood at one point, and also fed the hogs. That's it as far as daily chores go. Then comes the September harvest, when Olaf and his mail-order bride single-handedly, and without bloodied hands, cut down and collect about a quarter section of corn and harvest God knows how many acres of wheat, which they then proceeded to thresh themselves, by hand. All the while, the nasty people of the community who were shunning them go their merry way across the road using tractors and a stationary steam engine to harvest their wheat.In short, a completely implausible script blended with accompanying implausible photography. The reviewer for the New York Sun explained that this movie was made for boutique, SunDance-type festival audiences, where sensitive filmmakers preen while appreciating each other's leftist, non-commercial sensibilities.

1068507,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B000P5FH26,Turfseer,"[3, 16]","Here's a film that aspires to be included in the ranks of European Art Films but unfortunately doesn't quite make the grade. Before we flashback to the main story, we're treated to two ""flash forward"" scenes: one set in the 60s when the main character, Inge, buries her husband and another scene twenty or so years later when the grandson buries Inge. Instead of getting right into the story which is set in 1920s Minnestoa, we're treated to quite a bit of slow-paced, unnecessary exposition. When we finally do get to the core of the story, where Inge (well played by Elizabeth Reaser) comes to America, we find out little about the personalities of the characters.Most of the first half of the movie deals with Inge trying to cope with a hostile community where she barely speaks any English (it's not really explained very clearly, but Inge is a mail-order bride from Norway but she's actually German who's been living in Norway). Her husband-to-be Olaf, is a Norwegian-American who is unable to communicate with her in German (it appears that he can speak Norwegian and so can she--well at least I thought I heard her speak some Norwegian during the film) but they choose not to because the town minister insists that she only speak English. So quite unconvincingly, when they are alone, they never converse in Norwegian which would probably help her to learn English a lot faster.Reaser does a good job at showing how difficult it is learning a new language and there are some scenes that are fairly compelling as Inge and her hard-working farmer-husband learn to love each other. But beyond that what do we find out about the characters in this film? Well there's Olaf, who's a bit of a Stoic but also a real good guy who saves his best friend's farm by bidding for it at an auction (even though he doesn't have the money!). And of course there's the minister, who is caught up in the anti-German hysteria of the day and gives Inge a real hard time. But of course, he's really not such a bad guy after all because eventually he inexplicably comes to accept her. And in fact, all the neighbors, who at first appear as though they're going to start a witch-hunt against Olaf and his potential bride, suddenly have a change of heart and actually give Olaf the cash to buy his best friend's farm which prevents the family from being evicted.1920 Minnesota doesn't prove to be much of a bad place after all--not a bad apple amongst the suspicious neighbors who all turn out to collectively have hearts of gold. It's comfortable like a Hallmark Greeting Card but does not bode well for good drama which needs more of a sinister protagonist to keep things interesting. As we step back into 1920, we feel the author only has a superficial sense of what it was like to live back in that time. Oh yes, there's a nice attempt to recreate the look of the period with the old Model-T cars and gramophones but without in-depth characters, the film ultimately proves to be an exercise in sentimental storytelling.",2,Well-intentioned Immigrant Saga fails to reach Art House Grandeur,1237161600,"03 16, 2009",2009,3004,"['Here', 'film', 'be', 'included', 'ranks', 'European', 'Art', 'Films', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'grade', 'flashback', 'main', 'story', ""'re"", 'treated', 'two', 'flash', 'forward', 'scenes', 'one', 'set', '60s', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'Inge', 'husband', 'scene', 'twenty', 'so', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'grandson', 'buries', 'Inge', 'Instead', 'getting', 'right', 'story', 'set', '1920s', 'Minnestoa', ""'re"", 'treated', 'quite', 'bit', 'slow-paced', 'unnecessary', 'exposition', 'When', 'finally', 'do', 'get', 'core', 'story', 'where', 'Inge', 'well', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'Reaser', 'America', 'find', 'out', 'little', 'personalities', 'characters.Most', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'deals', 'Inge', 'trying', 'cope', 'hostile', 'community', 'where', 'barely', 'English', 'not', 'really', 'explained', 'very', 'clearly', 'Inge', 'mail-order', 'bride', 'Norway', 'actually', 'German', 'who', 'been', 'living', 'Norway', 'husband-to-be', 'Olaf', 'Norwegian-American', 'who', 'unable', 'communicate', 'German', 'can', 'speak', 'Norwegian', 'so', 'can', 'well', 'least', 'thought', 'heard', 'speak', 'Norwegian', 'film', 'choose', 'not', 'town', 'minister', 'only', 'speak', 'English', 'So', 'quite', 'unconvincingly', 'when', 'are', 'alone', 'never', 'converse', 'Norwegian', 'would', 'probably', 'help', 'learn', 'English', 'lot', 'faster.Reaser', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'difficult', 'learning', 'new', 'language', 'are', 'scenes', 'are', 'fairly', 'compelling', 'Inge', 'hard-working', 'farmer-husband', 'learn', 'love', 'other', 'what', 'do', 'find', 'out', 'characters', 'film', 'Well', 'Olaf', 'who', 'bit', 'Stoic', 'also', 'real', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'best', 'friend', 'farm', 'bidding', 'auction', 'even', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'course', 'minister', 'who', 'caught', 'up', 'anti-German', 'hysteria', 'day', 'Inge', 'real', 'hard', 'time', 'course', 'really', 'not', 'such', 'bad', 'guy', 'because', 'eventually', 'inexplicably', 'accept', 'fact', 'neighbors', 'who', 'first', 'appear', ""'re"", 'going', 'start', 'witch-hunt', 'Olaf', 'potential', 'bride', 'suddenly', 'have', 'change', 'heart', 'actually', 'give', 'Olaf', 'cash', 'buy', 'best', 'friend', 'farm', 'family', 'being', 'evicted.1920', 'Minnesota', ""n't"", 'prove', 'be', 'much', 'bad', 'place', 'not', 'bad', 'apple', 'suspicious', 'neighbors', 'who', 'turn', 'out', 'collectively', 'have', 'hearts', 'gold', 'comfortable', 'Hallmark', 'Greeting', 'Card', 'not', 'bode', 'well', 'good', 'drama', 'more', 'sinister', 'protagonist', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'step', 'back', '1920', 'feel', 'author', 'only', 'superficial', 'sense', 'what', 'was', 'live', 'back', 'time', 'Oh', 'yes', 'nice', 'attempt', 'recreate', 'look', 'period', 'old', 'Model-T', 'cars', 'gramophones', 'in-depth', 'characters', 'film', 'ultimately', 'be', 'exercise', 'sentimental', 'storytelling']",N/A

Padgett,"[0, 1]","I've seen the film twice, and watched the commentary twice, both a few years apart.You have to understand that this film is a memory piece, not a literal one. A poem, not a documentary. So you will see greens that were greener than they really were. Clothes that were nicer than they really wore. Director Ali Selim knew this. He said so, in his commentary.So the way Inge wore her hair, or how pretty she was, is what Inge remembers, thinking back from 1968 to 1920; not what really was.Harvesting corn in the day, threshing wheat (soybeans?) the next-- steam thresher or steam engine --- cutting acres of corn in one night-- this is not intended to be a farm documentary; it is intended to be a memory from 50 years hence.Some reviewers stated that if only there had been subtitles, the film would have been better, or made more sense. No! Not at all. I do speak German. I can tell you the lack of subtitles is not an issue.Ask yourself: Have you ever enjoyed a silent film? Or did you spend the whole time thinking ""this film would make better sense if we could hear what they were saying?"": No.Again, this is intentional-- Director Selim wants to focus you on the nonverbal, the visual-- not the literal. And you can pick up completely from that visual context what the communication is, wenn Sie deutsch verstehen k&ouml;nnen, oder nicht.
