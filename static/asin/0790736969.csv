Tim Curry as Gomez? Darryl Hannah as Morticia?? C'mon! These two have certainly seen better days, but hey, no one could possibly save this toilet-boat! Raoul Julia and John Astin must be spinning in their graves like cyclones over this! I only hope it never sees the light of DVD!

I can't rate it above 2 stars, that being the standard for mediocrity. It even picked up the ball dropped by the 80s version, but this is not the classic Addams family from TV. Tim Curry as Gomez gives it that made for TV horror feel, but Darryl Hanna as Morticica doesn't get that sultry but elegant, still sexy look for an older woman. For wanting Addams right here right now, it's not boring and is devoid of foul language. A mediocre movie from a Hollywood name that seen troubles since the classic 50s TV show.

Ostrowski ""bra1n1ac""","[15, 16]","Well, the actors and actresses were different from the first two movies, but that was to be expected, considering how one was dead, and two were too old to look the part, but all in all, not a bad film at all.I have been watching Addams-related media for quite some time, and although this film isn't much better than the others, it is certainly a far cry from being much WORSE as well.The toughest part of this film was getting used to the new faces.  After that, the second toughest part was getting used to the poor graphics given to the killer dog, but those are just inconsistensies and budget issues that could hardly be avoided...Thing was still a blast, Wednesday was still a lovable deadpan, Pugley was still a delinquent, etc, etc...  I found almost nothing wrong with the film except for what I mentioned above.Now a lot of people say the plot was common.  This is only partially true.  I agree that I wouldn't be surprised to see a plot like this showcased in the classic '60s series, but there would not have been as much adventure if it had been in that series.  Not only that, there is so little FAITHFUL Addams material coming out nowadays, we should feel blessed as long as they don't become the brady bunch.  (I have been rather Addams-starved for a while.)  I don't think I can explain it better than that.So all in all, a nice little film that doesn't tread on our memories and stays faithful to our well-established characters.

I can recall looking through Charles Addams' Homebodies before any other cartoon book.  The original TV series was a favorite in our house.  The first 2 movies were a delightful surprise of good acting, directing and and one liners from the old Charles Addams New Yorker cartoons.So when I saw that Tim Curry was playing Gomez in this made-for-VHS version I snapped it up; should have noted it co-starred Darrel Hanna. The same thing hit me every time she was on camera, ""Oh god, that Darrel Hanna in a back wig!"" This is undoubtedly the most unfunny movies I've ever seen.  I don't think there's one single adult laugh.  OK, maybe one.  The reason I'm giving it 2 stars as opposed to one is that it actually has merit as the most painful movie I've ever sat through and for THAT it's memorable.I recommend it as a white elephant gift, birthday present for you annoying mother-in-law or a sure fire way to get your kids to go to bed.

Much of what has been said in earlier reviews is accurate; the slapstick humor, almost nonexistent script, and obvious CGI really detract from the movie.  In fact, this was a pilot for the Fox Family channel's ""New Addams Family"" TV series, and that tells you most of what you need to know about this movie.What's heartbreaking is that, as appallingly bad as this movie was, the few bright spots are REALLY bright.  Tim Curry as Gomez?  Brilliant!  Daryl Hannah as Morticia?  I had my doubts, but she really made it work.  Ray Walston as the head of the single-D Adams clan?
