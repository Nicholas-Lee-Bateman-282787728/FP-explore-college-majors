778311,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B0000DD76U,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","A young, fresh-faced Robert Downey Jr. (billed as Robert Downey) was Jack Jericho, the pick up artist. He rehearses his pick up lines in front of his mirror, and refines them constantly. For instance, when the principal of the school he teaches at admonishes him for picking up on his student's mother with a line like, 'you have the face of a Picasso and the body of a Rubens' he can't help but criticize his choice of artists. Flemish Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens was known for his fondness for full-figured women, such as his Venus at the Mirror, so saying a woman has the body of a Rubens is tantamount to calling her fat. And Picasso was a cubist, so the face of a Picasso could have facial features in random locations, as in his Dora Maar au Chat or Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. He takes his principle's advice -- not the part about not hitting on anything in a skirt -- the part about Picasso faces and Rubens bodies being less than flattering. He refines his pick up line:Jack Jericho: Did anyone ever tell you that you have the face of a Botticelli and the body of a Degas?Writer/Director James Toback reportedly based the Jack character on himself. Jack Jericho is very likeable, except for the fact that he is always hitting on anything with a pulse. He teaches school, and coaches baseball, and he gives his grandmother her diabetes medicine and tries to keep her from scarfing down candy bars. Even if he does try to use the baseball team kids as props, his heart is generally in the right place.When he meets Randy Jensen (Molly Ringwald) his walls come tumblin' down. She is wise beyond her years but cynical and world weary -- the toll of taking care of her father, Flash (Dennis Hopper), a gambler with huge debts and a drinking problem. Harvey Keitel plays the thug who needs to collect, or else. Randy had to grow up fast to survive, and she sees right through an operator like Jack Jericho, and she'll have none of it. However, the more she shuns him, the harder he chases her. It is nice to see Molly with an edge. She's never been more attractive. She knows when to hold 'em, and she knows when to fold 'em, if you get my drift.Bottom line, this is a slightly silly romantic comedy, but I was very entertained by it. Downey is bubbling with energy, and Ringwald tries to bring him down, but you can't keep a good Downey down. Hopper was no Frank Booth, but he was still Hopper. Harvey Keitel was no Bad Lieutenant, but he was still Harvey Keitel. Danny Aiello did the right thing, and Lorraine Bracco sang like a soprano.Speaking of singing, there were some great tunes on the soundtrack, but sadly, the very next day after watching The Pick Up Artist I learned that Ellie Greenwich, who had co-written a lot of them, had just passed away:""Da Doo Ron Ron (When He Walked Me Home)""Written by Jeff Barry, Ellie Greenwich and Phil SpectorPerformed by The CrystalsProduced by Phil Spector""Do Wah Do Wah Do Wah Diddy (Talkin' 'bout the Boy From New York City)""Written by Jeff Barry and Ellie GreenwichPerformed by The Exciters""Wait Til' My Bobby Gets Home""Written by Jeff Barry, Ellie Greenwich and Phil SpectorPerformed by Darlene LoveProduced by Phil SpectorAside from these Greenwich classics there's also a scene set to ""She's Crafty"" by The Beastie Boys that strangely seems to fit; and watch for a credible performance of Carl Perkins' ""Blue Suede Shoes"" by the multi-talented Robert Downey Jr. and a would-be mugger. Stevie Wonder contributes a song called ""The Pick Up Artist""  and I wondered if the song was written for the movie, or if the movie was written around the song.A Scanner Darkly(2006)  Robert Downey

778322,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B0000DD76U,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[11, 14]","Molly Ringwald became a teenage phenomenon in the 80s with &quot;Pretty in Pink,&quot; &quot;Sixteen Candles,&quot; and &quot;The Breakfast Club.&quot; For a while it seemed as though every movie she made was a sure hit, until &quot;The Pick-Up Artist.&quot; This movie has several problems that make it much less likable than Molly's other movies, and it is one of my least favorite movies starring Molly Ringwald.Part of the problem with this movie is that Molly Ringwald actually is not the star. The principal character is Jack Jericho (Robert Downey, Jr.). Jack seems to have a mouth that continually runs. Jack seems to like to hear himself talk. Jack establishes at the beginning of the movie that he has one goal in life, and that is to meet, date and make love to as many women as possible. Clearly Jack is as shallow as plastic wrap.Randy Jenson (Ringwald) on the other hand is an enabler. Her father Flash Jensen (Dennis Hopper) has an alcohol and a gambling problem, and Molly is doing her best to get her father out of trouble, without solving the root of his problems that lead him to drinking. I kept thinking that Randy really needs help, both for herself and for Flash. That her only help was shallow Jack Jericho seemed to be totally inadequate. I kept interpreting everything Jack did in terms of his normal goal with women, which was very distracting. Thus, when Jack actually did change in a cliche sort of way I missed the change.This movie has some humorous moments, but they are offset too often by Robert Downey being annoying, and an intimate scene between Downey and Ringwald was a bit shocking for me. This movie is not a comedy at all, regardless of how wholesome, sweet and smiling Molly Ringwald looks on the cover.This movie is definitely not suitable for children, and is probably barely only suitable for teenagers. While the movie has its moments, I will provide only a weak recommendation. If you really like either Molly Ringwald or Robert Downey, then this movie will probably work for you. If you are expecting another movie similar to the three I mentioned earlier, all of which I consider to be far superior to this movie, then prepare to be disappointed.",3,Molly Ringwald Grows Up - Too Much,1090454400,"07 22, 2004",2004,2196,"['Molly', 'Ringwald', 'became', 'teenage', 'phenomenon', '80s', 'quot', 'Pretty', 'Pink', 'quot', 'quot', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'quot', 'quot', 'Breakfast', 'Club.', 'quot', 'while', 'seemed', 'movie', 'made', 'was', 'sure', 'hit', 'quot', 'Pick-Up', 'Artist.', 'quot', 'movie', 'several', 'problems', 'make', 'much', 'less', 'likable', 'Molly', 'other', 'movies', 'one', 'least', 'favorite', 'movies', 'starring', 'Molly', 'Ringwald.Part', 'problem', 'movie', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'actually', 'not', 'star', 'principal', 'character', 'Jack', 'Jericho', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Jack', 'have', 'mouth', 'continually', 'Jack', 'like', 'hear', 'talk', 'Jack', 'beginning', 'movie', 'one', 'goal', 'life', 'meet', 'date', 'make', 'love', 'many', 'women', 'possible', 'Clearly', 'Jack', 'as', 'shallow', 'plastic', 'wrap.Randy', 'Jenson', 'Ringwald', 'other', 'hand', 'enabler', 'father', 'Flash', 'Jensen', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'alcohol', 'gambling', 'problem', 'Molly', 'doing', 'best', 'get', 'father', 'trouble', 'solving', 'root', 'problems', 'lead', 'drinking', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Randy', 'really', 'help', 'herself', 'Flash', 'only', 'help', 'was', 'shallow', 'Jack', 'Jericho', 'seemed', 'be', 'totally', 'inadequate', 'kept', 'interpreting', 'everything', 'Jack', 'did', 'terms', 'normal', 'goal', 'women', 'was', 'very', 'distracting', 'Thus', 'when', 'Jack', 'actually', 'did', 'change', 'cliche', 'sort', 'way', 'missed', 'change.This', 'movie', 'humorous', 'moments', 'are', 'offset', 'too', 'often', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'being', 'annoying', 'intimate', 'scene', 'Downey', 'Ringwald', 'was', 'bit', 'shocking', 'movie', 'not', 'comedy', 'regardless', 'how', 'wholesome', 'sweet', 'smiling', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'cover.This', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'suitable', 'children', 'probably', 'barely', 'only', 'suitable', 'teenagers', 'movie', 'moments', 'will', 'provide', 'only', 'weak', 'recommendation', 'really', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'work', 'are', 'expecting', 'movie', 'similar', 'three', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'consider', 'be', 'far', 'superior', 'movie', 'then', 'prepare', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

778324,A15W2D3WJW7NP7,B0000DD76U,Pork Chop,"[0, 0]","The Pick-up Artist (1987) receives maximum points in the romanticcomedy genre, although originally, it is a work spinned as a tale abouta con-man, played by Robert Downey Jr who is only in it for himself as awomanizer, just getting by in life, with no definable ambition. As a result,the acting talent, the cast, the tight editing and pace of the story, thequality of the cinematography, the performances, and  the entertainmentadded together, form a powerful combination, rarely seen anymore on film.Certainly, this story is for the young at heart, not necessary dreamers, but those witha romantic spot. At the same time, Harvey Keitel makes an appearance as a collector of illegaldebts,or the ""muscle"" for a loan shark operater in the vicinity of an Atlantic City casinos.Keitel brings his down-to-earth and emotional depth to the story, making sure viewersnever forget or lose sight that this is not a fairy tale, or fiction, but a story that isvery possible, perfectly natural and  admirable. Molly Ringwald, ( sporting  an adolescentexuberance),and  Robert Downey Jr together form a powerful duo in capturing the sympathies of the audience.As if Keitel's presence were insufficient in bringing street-credibility overall,and satiating the most demanding critics, Dennis Hopper plays Ringwald's father, (as aquasi-retired gambler and alcoholic who has lot control over his life),  and Danny Aiello isincludedas a diner owner, obviously knowing Brooklyn, New York and city life, like the back of his hand.Indeed, much of the visuals are outstanding in the theaters or big screen TV's, such asthe interiors of a casino,  (roulette, poker table, slot machines), the perfection in filmingstreet scenes illuminated scantly by public lights, the varied colors, the reflections, etc.The skill of the work is demonstrated by the equilibrium in all aspects:  humor, challengingsituations, ups and downs of various  scenarios, the artistic aspects in each scene, thetireless attention and care to detail that is proven time  and  again. The music is also notoverdone.In sum, this is a funny, positive movie with some tough action combined... in other words, the90 mins roll by, almost unnoticed.

778325,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B0000DD76U,Richard Ross,"[2, 2]","This film marked the first collaboration between writer/director James Toback and Robert Downey, Jr. The two would go on to make 'Black and White' and 'Two Girls and a Guy'. Toback knew they were capable of more than they displayed here but with that being said this film is still lots of fun. It's not perfect, there are large credibility issues, but still. Jack Jericho (Downey, Jr.) is the titular character looking for the next great lay. His technique is hilarious and delivered at breakneck speed. He's too busy scoping out women down the block to focus in on any one woman. Jack gets thrown a curve ball when an attractive redhead (Ringwald) catches his eye. He's challenged when she doesn't fall for his charm and blows him off. He perseveres and within a half hour the two are enjoying a quickie in the backseat of his car. When the act is consummated she bolts without so much as giving him her name or number. Intrigued Jack sets out to learn all about her so that he can win her over. His investigation reveals that her name is Randy and she lives with an older man named Flash (Dennis Hopper). Flash is a drunk who owes a mobster named Alonzo (Harvey Keitel) a sizeable sum. Randy turns to gambling in the hopes of paying off the debt but it fails. Alonzo offers her a chance to work it off by pimping her out to a businessman (Bob Gunton). Before Randy can go through with it Jack intervenes. He takes on her debt as his own. As you can guess by now this Ringwald romantic comedy isn't like her John Hughes pictures. No, this is James Toback a director obsessed with sex, gambling, and danger. He does everything he can to challenge your expectations with the genre. Regardless the film falls victim to more than a few romantic comedy cliches. The film was originally rated R but edited to get a PG-13. Watch any of Keitel's or Ringwald's scenes with him and you can make out the four letter word that was taken out. This film is a fun ride that boasts a great soundtrack of Phil Spector produced classics, two winning performances by the leads and a great supporting cast that also includes Danny Aiello, and gorgeous New York city locations.",3,"Be Gentle, It's Their First Time",1247011200,"07 8, 2009",2009,2157,"['film', 'marked', 'first', 'collaboration', 'writer/director', 'James', 'Toback', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'two', 'would', 'go', 'make', ""'Black"", 'White', 'Girls', 'Guy', 'Toback', 'were', 'capable', 'more', 'displayed', 'here', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'still', 'lots', 'fun', 'not', 'perfect', 'are', 'large', 'credibility', 'issues', 'still', 'Jack', 'Jericho', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'titular', 'character', 'looking', 'next', 'great', 'lay', 'technique', 'hilarious', 'delivered', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'too', 'busy', 'scoping', 'out', 'women', 'down', 'block', 'focus', 'one', 'woman', 'Jack', 'thrown', 'curve', 'ball', 'when', 'attractive', 'redhead', 'Ringwald', 'eye', 'challenged', 'when', ""n't"", 'fall', 'charm', 'off', 'half', 'hour', 'two', 'are', 'enjoying', 'quickie', 'backseat', 'car', 'When', 'act', 'consummated', 'bolts', 'so', 'much', 'giving', 'name', 'number', 'Intrigued', 'Jack', 'out', 'learn', 'so', 'can', 'win', 'over', 'investigation', 'reveals', 'name', 'Randy', 'older', 'man', 'named', 'Flash', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Flash', 'drunk', 'who', 'mobster', 'named', 'Alonzo', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'sizeable', 'sum', 'Randy', 'gambling', 'hopes', 'paying', 'off', 'debt', 'Alonzo', 'chance', 'work', 'off', 'pimping', 'out', 'businessman', 'Bob', 'Gunton', 'Randy', 'can', 'go', 'Jack', 'debt', 'own', 'can', 'guess', 'now', 'Ringwald', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'John', 'Hughes', 'pictures', 'No', 'James', 'Toback', 'director', 'obsessed', 'sex', 'gambling', 'danger', 'everything', 'can', 'challenge', 'expectations', 'genre', 'Regardless', 'film', 'victim', 'more', 'few', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'cliches', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'rated', 'R', 'edited', 'get', 'PG-13', 'Watch', 'Keitel', 'Ringwald', 'scenes', 'can', 'make', 'out', 'four', 'letter', 'word', 'was', 'taken', 'out', 'film', 'fun', 'ride', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'Phil', 'Spector', 'produced', 'classics', 'two', 'winning', 'performances', 'leads', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'gorgeous', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'locations']",N/A
778326,A2WZYL0HNUR5XH,B0000DD76U,Robert Shuler,"[0, 0]","A gambling addict and a double-parking live-on-the-edge risk taker (who is no good at all at picking up women) luck out and escape from a life-threatening conflict with the mob (the addict's addicted father owes money), immediately come to their senses, and &quot;change their ways.&quot;  Do you believe it?  This fantasy ags risk takers on, as evidenced by one review below.Still, Molly Ringwald is adorable as Randy the risk-taking museum guide, and even though Robert Downey was a much more convincing (and appealing) pick up artist as the shoe salesman in &quot;Only You,&quot; I gave this movie 3 stars.  Dennis Hopper is quite convincing as Flash the lush-gambler-dad, and some of my favorite stars made cameo appearances.If taken as a serious movie, only the fiction of reform is flawed.  Everything else hangs nicely.  Jack (Downey) is co-dependently taking care of his grandmother, who is addicted to her own kind of risk, and as she makes a sudden recovery and needs him less, he switches to Molly, who is constantly propping up her drunk, gambler father, while sharing at least one of his vices.  Molly resists the new relationship until her dad shows signs of reforming.  Of course she'll need a new problem.Feel like taking a risk?  The movie is cheap enough.  Give it a shot.
