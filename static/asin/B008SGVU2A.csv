1575640,A1N4OFD1OGTVFI,B008SGVU2A,Mr. Dudley J. Tate,"[3, 3]","""Safari"" was made in 1956 and is superior entertainment made at a timewhen the story  was the most important part of every good movie andthe action was believeable.If there was such a thing as a 6 star rating, I would give this movie a 6 starrating because it is a story about real life experiences and does not containgrossly exaggerated action scenes.  It was made by people with considerabletalent and vision - Albert R. Brocolli was co-producer (he went on to producethe highly successful James Bond movies, along with Harry Saltzman) andTerence Young was director (he directed a number of the early James Bondmovies).  Brocolli was also a partner in forming Warwick Productions to makefilms in England.  ""Safari"" is a Warwick Production.The story which was photographed on location and is based on fact, dealswith the Mau Mau uprising which was a military conflict that took place in Kenyabetween 1952 and 1960.  It involved a Kikuyu dominated anti-colonial groupcalled Mau Mau and they fought elements of the British Army, auxiliaries andanti-Mau Mau Kikuyu for independence.Their method to get rid of the white settlers was by violence, both harsh andcruel.  Because they had few guns, their favourite weapon appeared to be themachete which was used to strike down their victims without mercy.  The mainproblem was that the settlers could not tell their friends from their enemiesand quite often their enemy was one of their most trusted native helpers.  Inthe circumstances you could not become complacent, so you trusted no one.You had to be vigilant at all times - not a satisfactory environment in which tolive.The story concentrates on Ken Duffield (Victor Mature) who was a white settlerliving in Kenya at the time on a somewhat isolated property in the country.  Helived there with his trusted native helpers and his young son who he adored andthey both loved each other.  At that time the influence of the Mau Mau was notestablished in that area but was spreading at a rapid rate and soon their propertybecame threatened.Duffield was notified of the approaching danger whilst out on patrol and hurriedback to his homestead but arrived too late only to find the homestead torched anddestroyed with the trusted native helpers dead.  Amongst the dead was his youngson who fought courageously to defend his home and was shot down at closequarters by three bullets from a supposedly loyal helper.Duffield's main thought was for revenge which in the circumstances was justifiedand he was prepared to do anything to get the person responsible.  As expected,the local authorities tried to restrain Duffield from taking matters into his own handsbut this did not stop him.  To circumvent the authorities, Duffield signed on to leada hunting safari into the interior.  The only problem was the leader of the safari,whose main intention was to capture an elusive lion that no one had been able totrack and he was prepared to do anything to personally capture it, including killinganyone who got in his way.Eventually, the safari was ambushed by the Mau Mau terrorists and the opportunityarose for Duffield to get his revenge because the leader of the terrorists who leadthe attack on his homestead and killed his son was present.The cinephotography and the native style musical score were both impressive and itshould be pointed out that the picture ratio on the disc is in its original widescreenformat of 2.55 to 1 and not in the ratio of 1.33 to 1 as stated in Amazon's technicaldescription.""Safari"" is entertainment at its very best.",5,Safari,1369353600,"05 24, 2013",2013,3541,"['Safari', 'was', 'made', '1956', 'superior', 'entertainment', 'made', 'timewhen', 'story', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'good', 'movie', 'andthe', 'action', 'was', 'believeable.If', 'was', 'such', 'thing', '6', 'star', 'rating', 'would', 'give', 'movie', '6', 'starrating', 'story', 'real', 'life', 'experiences', 'not', 'containgrossly', 'exaggerated', 'action', 'scenes', 'was', 'made', 'people', 'considerabletalent', 'vision', 'Albert', 'R.', 'Brocolli', 'was', 'co-producer', 'went', 'producethe', 'highly', 'successful', 'James', 'Bond', 'movies', 'Harry', 'Saltzman', 'andTerence', 'Young', 'was', 'director', 'directed', 'number', 'early', 'James', 'Bondmovies', 'Brocolli', 'was', 'also', 'partner', 'forming', 'Warwick', 'Productions', 'makefilms', 'England', 'Safari', 'Warwick', 'Production.The', 'story', 'was', 'photographed', 'location', 'based', 'fact', 'Mau', 'Mau', 'uprising', 'was', 'military', 'conflict', 'took', 'place', 'Kenyabetween', '1952', '1960', 'involved', 'Kikuyu', 'dominated', 'anti-colonial', 'groupcalled', 'Mau', 'Mau', 'fought', 'elements', 'British', 'Army', 'andanti-Mau', 'Mau', 'Kikuyu', 'method', 'get', 'rid', 'white', 'settlers', 'was', 'violence', 'harsh', 'andcruel', 'had', 'few', 'guns', 'favourite', 'weapon', 'appeared', 'be', 'themachete', 'was', 'used', 'strike', 'down', 'victims', 'mercy', 'mainproblem', 'was', 'settlers', 'could', 'not', 'tell', 'friends', 'enemiesand', 'quite', 'often', 'enemy', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'trusted', 'native', 'helpers', 'Inthe', 'circumstances', 'could', 'not', 'become', 'complacent', 'trusted', 'one.You', 'had', 'be', 'vigilant', 'times', 'not', 'satisfactory', 'environment', 'tolive.The', 'story', 'concentrates', 'Ken', 'Duffield', 'Victor', 'Mature', 'who', 'was', 'white', 'settlerliving', 'Kenya', 'time', 'somewhat', 'isolated', 'property', 'country', 'Helived', 'trusted', 'native', 'helpers', 'young', 'son', 'who', 'adored', 'andthey', 'loved', 'other', 'time', 'influence', 'Mau', 'Mau', 'was', 'notestablished', 'area', 'was', 'spreading', 'rapid', 'rate', 'soon', 'propertybecame', 'threatened.Duffield', 'was', 'notified', 'approaching', 'danger', 'out', 'patrol', 'hurriedback', 'homestead', 'arrived', 'too', 'late', 'only', 'find', 'homestead', 'torched', 'anddestroyed', 'trusted', 'native', 'helpers', 'dead', 'Amongst', 'dead', 'was', 'youngson', 'who', 'fought', 'courageously', 'defend', 'home', 'was', 'shot', 'down', 'closequarters', 'three', 'bullets', 'supposedly', 'loyal', 'helper.Duffield', 'main', 'thought', 'was', 'revenge', 'circumstances', 'was', 'justifiedand', 'was', 'prepared', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'person', 'responsible', 'expected', 'local', 'authorities', 'tried', 'restrain', 'Duffield', 'taking', 'matters', 'own', 'handsbut', 'did', 'not', 'stop', 'circumvent', 'authorities', 'Duffield', 'signed', 'leada', 'hunting', 'safari', 'interior', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'leader', 'safari', 'main', 'intention', 'was', 'capture', 'elusive', 'lion', 'one', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'totrack', 'was', 'prepared', 'do', 'anything', 'personally', 'capture', 'including', 'killinganyone', 'who', 'got', 'way.Eventually', 'safari', 'was', 'ambushed', 'Mau', 'Mau', 'terrorists', 'opportunityarose', 'Duffield', 'get', 'revenge', 'leader', 'terrorists', 'who', 'leadthe', 'attack', 'homestead', 'killed', 'son', 'was', 'present.The', 'cinephotography', 'native', 'style', 'musical', 'score', 'were', 'impressive', 'itshould', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'picture', 'ratio', 'disc', 'original', 'widescreenformat', '2.55', '1', 'not', 'ratio', '1.33', '1', 'stated', 'Amazon', 'technicaldescription', 'Safari', 'entertainment', 'very', 'best']",Safari

1575643,A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9,B008SGVU2A,William Amazzini,"[11, 14]","In the early fifties, Producers Irving Allen and Albert R. Broccoli formed Warwick Films, a British company which specialized in Action programmers utilizing American actors such as Alan Ladd (THE BLACK KNIGHT-1954).  Joining their party was Victor Mature and the first of his forays for them was an enjoyable combination of jungle thrills and revenge, Director Terence Young's 'SAFARI'- 1956 which was a staple of Sixties television.  Now for the first time, this rarity is presented by Sony/Columbia in a DVD-R preserving the CinemaScope image and shows a genre which went the way of the Western as passe and extinct.  In our modern age, who needs films on safari expeditions of big game hunting?  This film, however, also adds confrontations with killer Mau Mau tribes as Mature relentlessly pursues them to take revenge on their slaughter of his family and also getting mixed up with a millionaire big game hunter who brings along his fiance played by Janet Leigh and complicates matters by introducing a love triangle.  Mature looks great in the role and the film did modest box office convincing the producers to make more actioners with him including 'ZARAK' the same year also released as a DVD-R and 'THE BANDIT OF ZHOBE'-1959 which may see a digital release this year.  Allen would go onto produce other great programmers such as Director Jack Cardiff's 'THE LONG SHIPS'-1964 and Director Henry Levin's 'GENGHIS KHAN'-1965 plus the Dean Martin/Matt Helm series.  Broccoli would hit paydirt by teaming with Harry Saltzman and getting their hands on Ian Fleming's James Bond novels producing Director Terence Young's 'DR.NO'-1963 and the rest is history on that genre.  Its great escapist fare showing material no longer marketable at this time but still gives the viewer a touch of nostalgia for those simpler times.  Victor Mature fans may revel for these past months have seen many of his films being released and may introduce new fans to this underrated actor.",4,White Hunter Revenge Tale,1346716800,"09 4, 2012",2012,1973,"['early', 'fifties', 'Producers', 'Irving', 'Allen', 'Albert', 'R.', 'Broccoli', 'formed', 'Warwick', 'Films', 'British', 'company', 'specialized', 'Action', 'programmers', 'utilizing', 'American', 'actors', 'such', 'Alan', 'Ladd', 'THE', 'BLACK', 'KNIGHT-1954', 'Joining', 'party', 'was', 'Victor', 'Mature', 'first', 'forays', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'combination', 'jungle', 'thrills', 'revenge', 'Director', 'Terence', 'Young', ""'SAFARI'-"", '1956', 'was', 'staple', 'Sixties', 'television', 'Now', 'first', 'time', 'rarity', 'presented', 'Sony/Columbia', 'DVD-R', 'preserving', 'CinemaScope', 'image', 'genre', 'went', 'way', 'Western', 'passe', 'extinct', 'modern', 'age', 'who', 'films', 'safari', 'expeditions', 'big', 'game', 'hunting', 'film', 'however', 'also', 'confrontations', 'killer', 'Mau', 'Mau', 'Mature', 'relentlessly', 'take', 'revenge', 'slaughter', 'family', 'also', 'getting', 'mixed', 'up', 'millionaire', 'big', 'game', 'hunter', 'who', 'fiance', 'played', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'matters', 'introducing', 'love', 'triangle', 'Mature', 'great', 'role', 'film', 'did', 'modest', 'box', 'office', 'convincing', 'producers', 'make', 'more', 'actioners', 'including', 'same', 'year', 'also', 'released', 'DVD-R', 'BANDIT', 'OF', ""ZHOBE'-1959"", 'may', 'see', 'digital', 'release', 'year', 'Allen', 'would', 'go', 'produce', 'other', 'great', 'programmers', 'such', 'Director', 'Jack', 'Cardiff', 'LONG', ""SHIPS'-1964"", 'Director', 'Henry', 'Levin', ""KHAN'-1965"", 'Dean', 'Martin/Matt', 'Helm', 'series', 'Broccoli', 'would', 'hit', 'paydirt', 'teaming', 'Harry', 'Saltzman', 'getting', 'hands', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'James', 'Bond', 'novels', 'producing', 'Director', 'Terence', 'Young', ""'DR.NO'-1963"", 'rest', 'history', 'genre', 'great', 'escapist', 'fare', 'showing', 'material', 'no', 'longer', 'marketable', 'time', 'still', 'viewer', 'touch', 'nostalgia', 'simpler', 'times', 'Victor', 'Mature', 'fans', 'may', 'revel', 'past', 'months', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'films', 'being', 'released', 'may', 'introduce', 'new', 'fans', 'underrated', 'actor']",Safari
