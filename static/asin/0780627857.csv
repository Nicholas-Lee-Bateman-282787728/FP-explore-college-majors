It's another one of those comedies that tries to be edgy by including as much profanity and vulgarity as possible, but forgot to include as much comedy as possible. The favorite part for me was seeing the always funny John Witherspoon (Friday; Wayans Bros. Show). Unfortunately, he only has three or four scenes. House Party isn't bad. It's just average, I think. And I expected more from a comedy that spawned three sequels.",3,Not Really My Kind Of 'Party',1306281600,"05 25, 2011",2011,501,"['House', 'Party', 'comedy', 'shorter', 'laughs', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'comedies', 'be', 'edgy', 'including', 'as', 'much', 'profanity', 'vulgarity', 'possible', 'forgot', 'include', 'much', 'comedy', 'possible', 'favorite', 'part', 'was', 'seeing', 'always', 'funny', 'John', 'Witherspoon', 'Friday', 'Wayans', 'Bros.', 'Show', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'three', 'four', 'scenes', 'House', 'Party', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'average', 'think', 'expected', 'more', 'comedy', 'spawned', 'three', 'sequels']",N/A
35934,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,0780627857,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 12]","I am not ashamed to say that this was not a horrible film.  Upon finishing this film, I did a bit of research on it and discovered that this pioneer film (prior to the sequels) was actually a favorite among Sundance goers in 1990.  Apparently it racked up quite a bit of awards in the ""drama"" category.  While I must say that it was enjoyable to go back to this type of cinema, you know, the parents are away so the kids will play scenario, but I didn't think this was the best this genre had to offer.  Director Reginald Hudlin created this film for his thesis at Harvard as well as a benchmark for DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Price, so how did he finally end up with Kid & Play?  While I did think that Kid did a decent job with his character, which couldn't have been too far from himself, Play offered nothing new to the film.  Martin Lawrence continued to be the most annoying character in the film, while the love interests were clich&eacute;d from the start.  The music was fun, the dancing was laughable, and the police officers were racist ... so does that make for Sundance winning cinema?  Personally, there were elements that needed tightened and some that were great the way they were.  It wasn't the best film, but House Party did provide for an hour and a half of dusty memories.The characters were both a high point and the low point of the film.  House Party is a classic example of great starting characters that eventually dwindle away before the film officially ends.  I thought that Kid did a decent job of being a humorous element, while Play coupled with Martin Lawrence's character were just overly annoying.  I couldn't get attached to either of them.  It was obvious that Lawrence was working towards his character for his television show Martin throughout this entire film.  If you watch his television show and this film you will draw similar comparisons.  Play cannot act, and throughout this film it becomes apparently clear that his only true talent was acting because he even looses in the infamous rap competition. Tisha Campbell and AJ Johnson couldn't have been more clich&eacute;.  I say this with the warmest sympathies, but their characters had no depth, no originality, and carried nothing more than eye candy for the two male leads.  Women are handed these roles all the time, there are some that stand forward and say that they demand characters with more personality, but then you also have women like this that needed the paycheck.  Thinking back on the cast of this film, I do believe that Hudlin could have put more thought into everyone.  If you first pick is not available, there is no need to immediately jump to the bottom of the barrel. Be patient, the best could be right in front of you.  The film is worth watching for Kid, his expression in his eyes and face is immaculate, but for the rest, I have watched commercials with better character development.What about this story?  The story was an extremely simple set up.  High schoolers trying to go out on a school night to the dance party of the century get caught up in a web of trouble only to discover that what they think is important to them isn't necessarily true.  Also, true love lurks around the corner in the darkest of spaces.  Does this sound like a familiar Hollywood recycled plot to you?  To me it does, but what this film does which takes it out of the recycle bin category is the urban themes that Hudlin ignites.  While I thought that your typical film would have centered on a love affair, this urban film instead revolved around Kid trying to be a better lyricist.  While some will argue that love is the central focus of this film, I saw his desire to be a better performer to the ultimate moment for our character.  In nearly all of his scenes he is attempting to finally be the best at his rap game, and finally, even in the jail cell, he proves that he can handle himself with the best.  I liked this focus.  I liked seeing Kid evolve throughout the film.  What I didn't like, and thought was completely trashy, was the racial undertones that Hudlin threw in the mix.  The white police officer jokes were not funny.  I thought the point where they took the bullies to the docks and beat them was completely uncalled for and ruined the light tone of this film.  Was that funny?  This reviewer wasn't laughing at all.Overall, I thought this was a decent film.  I have no doubt in my eyes that the sequels that were spun do not carry the overall excitement that was conveyed in this first film, but for now, House Party was a light, enjoyable film that christened a new range of actors into the Hollywood circuit.  Could one safely say that this was the first film to introduce rappers as actors?  I haven't seen enough films to make that assumption, but I wouldn't mind making a wager.  This is a historical film, but not one that can be watched over and over again.  The language seemed a bit strong for the levity of the film, but outside of the key points where Hudlin failed (Lawrence role, white officers, clich&eacute; women), I thought that this film quietly fell into place by the end.  It reminded me of some of the Feldman/Haim match-ups with an urban flair.Grade: *** out of *****",3,"Wave your hands in the air, everybody!",1136678400,"01 8, 2006",2006,5217,"['am', 'not', 'ashamed',

I still love this movie...especially knowing that many of the actors were my age when they were filming!My sons, now in high school also love this movie.  The music and the moves, but they do have fun making jokes about the clothes.  It was a movie that really tapped into young African-American's and their high school, hip hop world.  The Hudlin's were indeed influrenced by Cooley High, but so what!  That was a great influence.  I also love the messages that are placed in the movie without beating you over the head.  Safe sex, no drinking, being there for your friends...even if it means leaving them on their porch while you take their dj equipment.Frankly I can't imagine Will Smith and Jazzy Jeff in this movie.

""A New Yorker""","[1, 2]","I had seen the film when it first debuted back in 1990, and enjoyed it quite a bit, but looking back today, it's hard for me to divorce myself from a certain nostalgia for the look, sound and feel of the urban scene of 1990, when I was as deep into the music as I would ever be.  Although this movie doesn't really feature artists on the cutting edge of hip hop of the day, and Kid N Play would come to be known more for their appearance in the House Party movies than anything they ever did as recording artists, there is still a beauty in the way the dialogue is presented and in the fashion of the young African-American teenagers that keeps it interesting for those that embrace such things.Obviously, at the center of the film is a house party, where the high school clique gets together for some fun, dancing, a little drinking, and a little romance.  The gist of the story is that Kid (Reid), a hyperactive high schooler with an enormous high-top fade hair style, is grounded for misdeeds in school, but he still manages a way to sneak out and join the fun.  Some of the emphasis is on the romantic connections that will form between two of the girls there, Sidney (Campbell, Little Shop of Horrors) and Charane (Johnson, Dying Young), which Kid (Martin) and his best friend, Play, seem to be vying for.  Meanwhile, the high school bullies (Full Force) that got Kid in trouble to begin with are on the prowl for him, while everyone must overcome overzealous cops, whiny neighbors, and maintaining a rep among the peers.Although it was a modest hit when it was released, the enduring legacy of House Party is that it would eventually set the trend for nearly every party film that would come after it (Can't Hardly Wait is one prime example).  It is also refreshing because it plays to its intended audience, but never speaks down to it, nor does it exclude people that aren't part of the scene it portrays from enjoying it.  Unlike many other films which featured African-American casts of the time, it doesn't beat you over the head with forced positive messages, and conversely, it is mostly devoid of gangster drama, drugs, or serious crime that usually rear their ugly heads whenever an all-Black cast emerges ina Hollywood film.  While there is some very subtle commentary on the nature of police suspicion of Blacks, safe sex, and drinking, they never veer into contrived melodrama, and in fact, they add a good deal of humor to the proceedings without seeming anything like a public service announcement.

I love this movie so much because the story perfectly what life was like for teens my age back then. I remember wearing the flat-top fade haircuts (still wear mine to this day), the dope clothes, writing the dope fresh rhymes, working hard in school, all in between fending off the knuckleheads, and talking to the girls. Besides being the movie of my generation, it truly is a classic African-American movie.Made for the low low price of $3million by the Hudlin Brothers the film became a huge hit and a cult classic. The story follows Kid as he tries to go to Play's house party. The only problem: his Dad has grounded him for having a fight earlier that day. Sneaking out that night to go to the party he runs afoul of those Full Force knuckleheads (sporting jerricurl mullets) and racist cops. At the party he dances the night away macking both Sydney and Sherraine, then battles his boy play on the mic beating him handily cause Kid spelled backwards describes Play best. After walking Sydney home he comes this close to getting some. Unfortunately when her parents come home he's forced to leave. Outside he runs afoul of those Full Force knuckleheads. That leads to a stint in jail and some really inspired rapping from kid. His friends bail him out and after some burger king, Kid sneaks back in his house where he pays the painfully funny price for his night of fun.The film chock full of laughs with perfect comic timing in every frame. Rappers Kid N' Play give great performances as do the members of Full force. However, the films supporting cast is what makes this movie a classic. The Late Robin Harris is perfect as Kid's cantankerous dad (Watch this move and you'll realize Bernie Mac stole his act) and Martin Lawrence steals scenes here. Tisha Campbell is great as the love intrest. Other noteworthy performances are from Darryl ""Chill"" Mitchell, the girl who plays Sydney's everyone blends into the background seamlessly and becomes a character. The Hudlin Brothers do a great job here; with their imagination they overcome the limitations of small budget by making a film that is as fresh today as it was way back in 1990.This is a Shawn James essential video.

35962,A3UA046AA3DXFD,0780627857,Sid the Elf,"[0, 0]","At this point in time you may or may not know about Sid the Elf and the movie choices we make. For the most part we seek out b but always sprinkle in classics that weigh heavy in the sentimental department. There are more then a handful of our personal classics ranging from every genre which leads us to the original House Party. It was one of those we used to pop in VHS style to set off a long evening of happy times. We'd always start with comedy early on saving a nice horror or unrated Movie Channel feature for the later part of the evening. It may not make sense to most, but for us it was the best times which are still talked about on a weekly basis.For those of you not familiar with House Party we give a brief breakdown of it's comic goodness. The films stars 80's/early 90's rap duo Kid n Play as they set off to throw a big party while Play's parents are out of town. Along the way plenty happens thanks to Kid's angry father, a gang of street toughs from school, and some insanely hilarious dance offs. It's one of those films that could only make sense for the era it came out in which is why we love it. The 80's and 90's just have a certain feel that can't be beat. Now that many years have passed since our last viewing, when it came on t.v Saturday afternoon we figured why not revisit it again and throw it in the review library. For us it's a classic and piece of Sid history worthy of a 5 star rating even after all these years.",5,I'm going to mind my........business,1257552000,"11 7, 2009",2009,1452,"['point', 'time', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'Sid', 'Elf', 'movie', 'make', 'most', 'part', 'seek', 'out', 'b', 'always', 'sprinkle', 'classics', 'weigh', 'heavy', 'sentimental', 'department', 'are', 'more', 'then', 'handful', 'personal', 'classics', 'ranging', 'genre', 'original', 'House', 'Party', 'was', 'one', 'used', 'pop', 'VHS', 'style', 'set', 'off', 'long', 'evening', 'happy', 'times', ""'d"", 'always', 'start', 'comedy', 'early', 'saving', 'nice', 'horror', 'unrated', 'Movie', 'Channel', 'feature', 'later', 'part', 'evening', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'most', 'was', 'best', 'times', 'are', 'still', 'talked', 'weekly', 'basis.For', 'not', 'familiar', 'House', 'Party', 'give', 'brief', 'breakdown', 'comic', 'goodness', 'films', 'stars', ""80's/early"", '90', 'rap', 'duo', 'Kid', 'n', 'Play', 'set', 'off', 'throw', 'big', 'party', 'Play', 'parents', 'are', 'town', 'way', 'plenty', 'thanks', 'Kid', 'angry', 'father', 'gang', 'street', 'toughs', 'school', 'insanely', 'hilarious', 'dance', 'offs', 'one', 'films', 'could', 'only', 'make', 'sense', 'era', 'came', 'out', 'why', 'love', '80', '90', 'just', 'have', 'certain', 'feel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'beat', 'Now', 'many', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'last', 'viewing', 'when', 'came', 't.v', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'figured', 'why', 'not', 'revisit', 'again', 'throw', 'review', 'library', 'classic', 'piece', 'Sid', 'history', 'worthy', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'even', 'years']",N/A
