I started going back to some yoga and and started Pilates to improve my flexibility and strengthen my lower back which also helped to compliment  this program.

I did it for the first time yesterday, however, and was very disappointed by how short it is.Although the DVD does start with a review of the basic moves/kicks you'll be doing and a brief history of this martial art, the workout itself is only about 20 minutes long, including the warmup.  There is also no cool-down or stretch at the end.On the positive side, all of the music is by Mestre Bimba and there are some good sample rodas to watch and learn from.Overall, it's an alright workout that provides a nice overview of the basic moves (like Beno, Queixada, Martelo, etc.), but I felt like it could have been much longer.",3,Very short workout!,1181779200,"06 14, 2007",2007,860,"['used', 'do', 'capoeira', 'few', 'years', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'time', 'go', 'classes', 'almost', 'year', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'see', 'DVD', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'way', 'continue', 'practice', 'own', 'did', 'first', 'time', 'yesterday', 'however', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'how', 'short', 'DVD', 'start', 'review', 'basic', 'moves/kicks', ""'ll"", 'be', 'doing', 'brief', 'history', 'martial', 'art', 'workout', 'only', 'about', '20', 'minutes', 'long', 'including', 'warmup', 'also', 'cool-down', 'stretch', 'end.On', 'positive', 'side', 'music', 'Mestre', 'Bimba', 'are', 'good', 'sample', 'rodas', 'watch', 'learn', 'from.Overall', 'alright', 'workout', 'nice', 'overview', 'basic', 'moves', 'Beno', 'Queixada', 'Martelo', 'etc', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'longer']","The Capoeira Workout: Open level capoeira instruction, Martial arts dance fusion, Capoeira fitness workout classes"

This is one of the most fabulous exercise &, instructional programs from World Dance New York that I have gladly subjected my body to. I found Capoeria  a playful, skilled dance with martial arts woven in gracefully and sublelty. One may think of martial arts and remember Bruce Lee.; but here comes Paula to put it all together as a fun,intense work out with full benefits in muscle tone, agility,and flexability.Beginning with the warm-up, this is intense. The program incorporates level changes, kicks, torso rotations, cartwheels. You will feel every muscle in your body claim its name.  The amazing thing is that upon viewing the program initially, one may have the misconception that this program is not for them. Follow through with the warm up and instantly you are hooked. Paula has a way of presenting the warm up that is friendly and inviting and not threatening even for the faithful couch potato.The technique is explained in sections, then applied in 2 workout sessions; the first section introduces the basics and slow technique, the second workout session applies intense kicks, torso rotations on the floor which are faster paced.This dvd is rich in content and runs approximately 38 minutes.Paula and her partners devote a section to explain the use of hand held instruments used in playing the capoeria rhyhtms, a section for exhibition of capoiera games, and then Paula herself in a skillful exhibit of her abilities in capoiera. She is beautiful to watch!I have been doing some of the capoeira moves only a few days, and found myself applying some of the lunges and torso balancing in my sword dancing with a faster response time. Initally, I did not think I could follow through, the lunges were challenging, but I am glad I did.I love this program, it is full of benefits that enrich my dance life.",5,A fun martial arts dance,1192233600,"10 13, 2007",2007,1901,"['One', 'may', 'ask', 'what', 'capoeira', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'found', 'out', 'now', 'should', 'too', 'one', 'most', 'fabulous', 'exercise', 'instructional', 'programs', 'World', 'Dance', 'New', 'York', 'have', 'gladly', 'subjected', 'body', 'found', 'Capoeria', 'playful', 'skilled', 'dance', 'martial', 'arts', 'woven', 'gracefully', 'sublelty', 'One', 'may', 'think', 'martial', 'arts', 'remember', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'here', 'Paula', 'put', 'together', 'fun', 'intense', 'work', 'out', 'full', 'benefits', 'muscle', 'tone', 'agility', 'flexability.Beginning', 'warm-up', 'intense', 'program', 'level', 'changes', 'kicks', 'torso', 'rotations', 'cartwheels', 'will', 'feel', 'muscle', 'body', 'claim', 'name', 'amazing', 'thing', 'viewing', 'program', 'initially', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'misconception', 'program', 'not', 'Follow', 'warm', 'up', 'instantly', 'are', 'hooked', 'Paula', 'way', 'presenting', 'warm', 'up', 'friendly', 'inviting', 'not', 'threatening', 'even', 'faithful', 'couch', 'potato.The', 'technique', 'explained', 'sections', 'then', 'applied', '2', 'workout', 'sessions', 'first', 'section', 'basics', 'slow', 'technique', 'second', 'workout', 'session', 'intense', 'kicks', 'torso', 'rotations', 'floor', 'are', 'faster', 'paced.This', 'dvd', 'rich', 'content', 'approximately', '38', 'minutes.Paula', 'partners', 'devote', 'section', 'explain', 'use', 'hand', 'held', 'instruments', 'used', 'playing', 'capoeria', 'rhyhtms', 'section', 'exhibition', 'capoiera', 'games', 'then', 'Paula', 'skillful', 'exhibit', 'abilities', 'capoiera', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'capoeira', 'only', 'few', 'days', 'found', 'applying', 'lunges', 'torso', 'balancing', 'sword', 'dancing', 'faster', 'response', 'time', 'Initally', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'could', 'follow', 'lunges', 'were', 'challenging', 'am', 'glad', 'did.I', 'love', 'program', 'full', 'benefits', 'enrich', 'dance', 'life']","The Capoeira Workout: Open level capoeira instruction, Martial arts dance fusion, Capoeira fitness workout classes"
