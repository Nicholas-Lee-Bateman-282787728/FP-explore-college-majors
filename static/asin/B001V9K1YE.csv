A good Western type movie,4,If you like Cheyenne,1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,140,"['am', 'fan', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'almost', 'anything', 'movie', 'very', 'typical', 'work', 'Cheyenne', 'TV', 'series', 'good', 'Western', 'type', 'movie']",N/A

Same goes for another Clint Walker western FORT DOBBS (1958), almost makes you wonder what Warner Bros. have against ole Clint.  Maybe walking off the set of Cheyenne fifty some years back still rankles Warner Bros. Gordon Douglas directed  all three movies, FORT DOBBS, YELLOWSTONE KELLY (1959), and GOLD OF THE SEVEN SAINTS and as noted not one of these fine westerns has ever been released on DVD.This movie comes from the 1957 western novel DESERT GUNS written by Steve Frazee, with the movie (1961) and book being fairly different.  I think so much of the movie that I tracked down the book (which can be kinda hard to find) wishing to see how much variance there is between the two.  Well for instance, Rainbolt is 26 years old in the book yet Shawn is in his 50s.  Anyone seeing the movie will know right off that neither Clint nor Roger are portrayed like that.  Also at book's ending Rainbolt rides off with a female.  Just a couple of differences, there are several more. One other for instance:  Roger Moore is tied with wet rawhide in the movie, but in the book it is Rainbolt completely wrapped in wet hide so all the victim can view is the sky.Another aspect to this western film is the performance that rings down the years from veteran actor Chill Wills, his portrayal of Doctor Wilson Gates is one that will remain with most viewers.  You really come to appreciate him as the film rolls on.However, to me the movie is superior to the book.  Probably because I saw it first and read the book later.  Last words would be:  watch the movie because it is an interesting story filled with adventure very well portrayed by Clint and Roger.  The black and white photography  (Joseph F. Biroc) adds a stark reality that color might not have captured as well.  The location (Arches National Park, Utah) of the movie also adds to the panorama of the scenes and the story itself.  I have several favorite western movies and this is one of them, if you watch the movie it may become one of yours as well.Clint Walker-Jim RainboltRoger Moore-Shawn GarrettLeticia Roman-Tita, Gondora's 'ward'Robert Middleton-Amos GondoraChill Wills-Doctor Wilson GatesGene Evans-McCrackenand othersSemper Fi.",4,BLACK AND WHITE SAGA,1252540800,"09 10, 2009",2009,2346,"['Down', 'years', 'last', '5', 'so', 'anyway', 'have', 'recorded', 'several', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'figure', 'out', ""'why"", 'DVD', 'yet', 'been', 'issued', 'Same', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'western', 'FORT', 'DOBBS', '1958', 'almost', 'wonder', 'what', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'have', 'ole', 'Clint', 'Maybe', 'walking', 'off', 'set', 'Cheyenne', 'fifty', 'years', 'back', 'still', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'Gordon', 'Douglas', 'directed', 'three', 'movies', 'FORT', 'DOBBS', 'YELLOWSTONE', 'KELLY', '1959', 'GOLD', 'OF', 'THE', 'SEVEN', 'SAINTS', 'as', 'noted', 'not', 'one', 'fine', 'westerns', 'ever', 'been', 'released', 'DVD.This', 'movie', '1957', 'western', 'novel', 'DESERT', 'GUNS', 'written', 'Steve', 'Frazee', 'movie', '1961', 'book', 'being', 'fairly', 'different', 'think', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'tracked', 'down', 'book', 'can', 'be', 'kinda', 'hard', 'find', 'wishing', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'variance', 'two', 'Well', 'instance', 'Rainbolt', '26', 'years', 'old', 'book', 'yet', 'Shawn', '50s', 'Anyone', 'seeing', 'movie', 'will', 'know', 'right', 'off', 'Clint', 'Roger', 'are', 'portrayed', 'Also', 'book', 'ending', 'Rainbolt', 'rides', 'off', 'female', 'Just', 'couple', 'differences', 'are', 'several', 'more', 'One', 'other', 'instance', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'tied', 'wet', 'rawhide', 'movie', 'book', 'Rainbolt', 'completely', 'wrapped', 'wet', 'hide', 'victim', 'can', 'view', 'sky.Another', 'aspect', 'western', 'film', 'performance', 'down', 'years', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Chill', 'Wills', 'portrayal', 'Doctor', 'Wilson', 'Gates', 'one', 'will', 'remain', 'most', 'viewers', 'really', 'come', 'appreciate', 'film', 'rolls', 'on.However', 'movie', 'superior', 'book', 'Probably', 'saw', 'first', 'read', 'book', 'later', 'Last', 'words', 'would', 'be', 'watch', 'movie', 'interesting', 'story', 'filled', 'adventure', 'very', 'well', 'portrayed', 'Clint', 'Roger', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'Joseph', 'F.', 'Biroc', 'stark', 'reality', 'color', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'captured', 'as', 'well', 'location', 'Arches', 'National', 'Park', 'Utah', 'movie', 'also', 'panorama', 'scenes', 'story', 'have', 'several', 'favorite', 'western', 'movies', 'one', 'watch', 'movie', 'may', 'become', 'one', 'yours', 'well.Clint', 'Walker-Jim', 'RainboltRoger', 'Moore-Shawn', 'GarrettLeticia', 'Roman-Tita', 'Gondora', ""'ward'Robert"", 'Middleton-Amos', 'GondoraChill', 'Wills-Doctor', 'Wilson', 'GatesGene', 'Evans-McCrackenand', 'Fi']",N/A

It was an interesting plot & actors were good in their roles and finally it was not like all the many Cheyenne parts. He plays a different character & I admire him for the changes although it is hard for me to ever forget CHEYENNE because they just do not portray his particular anyone like him. Too bad more had been raised by the cheyenne....of course we all know it was just a part he played but some of the characteristics had to be within Mr. Walker.

I expected better but will probably give it another shot before deciding whether or not to keep it.  The story is basically about a couple of buddies who have some gold they're trying to cash in and the bad guys are after it so they hide it.  Pretty predictable and, unless I missed it, ""the seven saints"" wasn't really explained.  There's one whole segment at the house of Clint's old ""friend"" (which I fast-forwarded through--maybe that's when the ""saints"" was revealed) that could have been completely left out as it really didn't add anything to the storyline and actually bogged the movie down somewhat.
