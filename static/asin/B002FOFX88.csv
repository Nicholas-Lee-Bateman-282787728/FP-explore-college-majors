1266484,ANRTCX6S5BNUY,B002FOFX88,Jean,"[3, 5]","I watched this when it was on NBC and it was pretty bad.  With the exception of Treat Williams and David James Elliott, I was wondering who those others were advertised as stars.  Being I'm not a teenager is probably why I didn't know them.  The split screen scenes are over done.  There are not just 2 scenes at one time but 3 or 4.  Add to that the advertisements for NBC's fall shows along the bottom and it was a confusing mess to watch.  I know those ads will not be on the DVD. Van Der Beek is stone faced thoughout the movie and in my personal opinion a terrible actor.  I am not sure who Teri Polo was but a friend told me they thought she was the news woman killed in the first hour in a cheap rip off of the shower scene in Psycho.  Treat Williams is good in the movie but he does ham it up at times.  If you like this type of movie you might like this one.  I must confess that I only watched it as I am a JAG fan and watched to see David James Elliott who had a small role as the Army General.  NBC heavily advertised that he was in the movie so it was disappointing to see his role so small.  If you are a fan of his just watch the trailer and you will see about half of his scenes. The plot has been done before in other movies made for TV.  This one is overall not very original.",2,"Bad script, bad acting",1253664000,"09 23, 2009",2009,1294,"['watched', 'when', 'was', 'NBC', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'exception', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'David', 'James', 'Elliott', 'was', 'wondering', 'who', 'others', 'were', 'advertised', 'stars', 'Being', ""'m"", 'not', 'teenager', 'probably', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'split', 'screen', 'scenes', 'are', 'done', 'are', 'not', 'just', '2', 'scenes', 'one', 'time', '3', '4', 'Add', 'advertisements', 'NBC', 'fall', 'bottom', 'was', 'confusing', 'mess', 'watch', 'know', 'ads', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'DVD', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'stone', 'faced', 'movie', 'personal', 'opinion', 'terrible', 'actor', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'Teri', 'Polo', 'was', 'friend', 'told', 'thought', 'was', 'news', 'woman', 'killed', 'first', 'hour', 'cheap', 'rip', 'shower', 'scene', 'Psycho', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'good', 'movie', 'ham', 'up', 'times', 'like', 'type', 'movie', 'might', 'like', 'one', 'must', 'confess', 'only', 'watched', 'am', 'JAG', 'fan', 'watched', 'see', 'David', 'James', 'Elliott', 'who', 'had', 'small', 'role', 'Army', 'General', 'NBC', 'heavily', 'advertised', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'disappointing', 'see', 'role', 'so', 'small', 'are', 'fan', 'just', 'watch', 'trailer', 'will', 'see', 'half', 'scenes', 'plot', 'been', 'done', 'other', 'movies', 'made', 'TV', 'one', 'overall', 'not', 'very', 'original']",The Storm

1266487,A1IRFAUJUS0IWY,B002FOFX88,Lynda Dunbar,"[1, 1]","While I like the premis of the movie and I always like disaster movies, this one was really long (done in 2 parts).  They tended to dwell on some scenes like they were trying to drag it out to fill time.  They also kept flashing superimposed still scene shots throughout the entire movie that are beyond annoying and serves no beneficial purpose.  They also didn't merge parts 1 and 2 very well.  They ended part 1 in the middle of a crisis (I'm sure for a cliffhanger effect) and started part 2 after the conclusion/end result of the crisis (which the end result was only shown as news report clips during the opening credits on the second part, and left everything in between out). Other things happening at the end of part 1 didn't pick up where they left off in part 2.  I did like the plot.  As a disaster movie, I liked it.  As a secret government conspiracy/cover-up type movie, I liked it.  I'll undoubtedly watch it again.  I would probably recommend it, but I'd warn everyone about the length of the movie and also the overkill on those still scene shots first.",4,"Pretty Good Movie, But Could've Been Done Much Better.",1385424000,"11 26, 2013",2013,1071,"['like', 'premis', 'movie', 'always', 'disaster', 'movies', 'one', 'was', 'really', 'long', 'done', '2', 'parts', 'tended', 'dwell', 'scenes', 'were', 'trying', 'drag', 'out', 'fill', 'time', 'also', 'kept', 'flashing', 'superimposed', 'still', 'scene', 'shots', 'entire', 'movie', 'are', 'annoying', 'beneficial', 'purpose', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'merge', 'parts', '1', '2', 'very', 'well', 'ended', 'part', '1', 'middle', 'crisis', ""'m"", 'sure', 'cliffhanger', 'effect', 'started', 'part', '2', 'conclusion/end', 'result', 'crisis', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'only', 'shown', 'news', 'report', 'clips', 'opening', 'credits', 'second', 'part', 'left', 'everything', 'Other', 'things', 'happening', 'end', 'part', '1', 'did', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'part', '2', 'did', 'plot', 'disaster', 'movie', 'liked', 'secret', 'government', 'conspiracy/cover-up', 'type', 'movie', 'liked', ""'ll"", 'undoubtedly', 'watch', 'again', 'would', 'probably', 'recommend', ""'d"", 'warn', 'everyone', 'length', 'movie', 'also', 'overkill', 'still', 'scene', 'shots', 'first']",The Storm

1266489,A3AY9OT5NG38O0,B002FOFX88,political idiot,"[7, 12]","There are some key elements to identifying a poorly made film be it television or large screen: Over use of very close up shots, jerky camera activity, silly post production effects, third rate actors, amature CGI, childish script, obvious amature production quality (lighting, fake rain machines, etc), poor acting, action sequences that bore the viewer, incorherent story lines, rediculous computer input sceens with people typing 300 words per minute while talking. There are more I am sure. Most movies contain some of these elements but in general large screen movies contain fewer then small screen do just as a function of budget differences. I tend to give small screen productions a little slack due to these budget challenges.That said, The Storm is a rare production. It embraces, with reckless abandon, all of the elements of a substandard movie. Bordering on parody, The Storm is almost unwatchable. Treat Williams, the poor man's Harrison Ford, leads a pedestrian cast of hacks sleep walking through this long, very long, two hour (with ads) movie. Needless to say you sould skip this one.
