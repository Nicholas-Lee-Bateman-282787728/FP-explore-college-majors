The 'detectives' (one French and one English) were completely without charisma and their acting ressembled something from a school play... resulting in a rare collaboration of cross-channel dilletance !The incestrous and promiscuous elements and sexual under (and over) tones were used to little effect, other than possibly attract a couple of people by the ability of making 'steamy' trailers.....A waste of time",1,80 minutes worth forgetting,1249430400,"08 5, 2009",2009,779,"['short', 'movie', 'seemed', 'have', 'lot', 'going', 'interesting', 'generally', 'attractive', 'actors', 'poster', 'however', 'turned', 'out', 'main', 'asset', 'was', 'was', 'over', 'only', '80', 'minutes', 'plot', 'turned', 'out', 'not', 'really', 'be', 'plot', 'characters', 'were', 'flawed', 'unimaginable', 'extend', 'not', 'shades', 'grey', 'more', 'realistic', 'preferable', 'reason', ""'detectives"", 'one', 'French', 'one', 'English', 'were', 'completely', 'charisma', 'acting', 'ressembled', 'something', 'school', 'play', 'resulting', 'rare', 'collaboration', 'cross-channel', 'dilletance', 'incestrous', 'promiscuous', 'elements', 'sexual', 'over', 'tones', 'were', 'used', 'little', 'effect', 'other', 'possibly', 'attract', 'couple', 'people', 'ability', 'making', ""'steamy"", 'trailers', '..A', 'waste', 'time']",Innocent Lies VHS
