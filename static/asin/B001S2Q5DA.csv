Hauser""","[1, 1]","On January 23, 1983, something happened on a farm in Aberystwyth, Wales, which covered a farmer's land with a wide area of metal/resin/foil debris.  From here, the story is very similar to the Roswell, New Mexico, UFO story.  The police were called and couldn't figure out what it was, the RAF showed up, couldn't identify the chunks of material, were certain it wasn't one of their aircraft, then the Ministry of Defense shows up and removes every scrap of evidence, or so they tried.The twist here, which makes this little documentary truly amazing, is that whatever crashed in the fields, first sheered off the tops of the trees of a nearby woods, and deposited debris where UFO researchers found their own samples before officialdom actually leveled the woods to the ground and sealed the area.We get a good look at a number of chunks of this wreckage, one piece a foot square.  It's some sort of composite material, 6-sided honeycombed foil/metal stuff sandwiched between a plastic resin, still never identified.Even after all these years, all that can be deduced from analysis is that yes, this is some sort of material you might use for an aircraft, but no, nobody knows who makes this, or how.  It's very strong and very light and that's the whole story.And we get to see it.  I think it's the real thing.

1234716,A1DE6GXMW2FMAJ,B001S2Q5DA,"Jasper T. ""Spectral Swedborgian""","[2, 5]","The lead figure in this film, Mark Olly, tries far too hard to appear like some mystery figure; an old fashioned ""highway man"" of old Britain.  In truth, you would expect to see exactly such characters in this costume making the rounds at all the renaissance faires, or as an unpaid extra on the set of The Fellowship of the Ring, lurking around the Prancing Pony Inn, spying on Frodo.  Such a pathetically, quasi-comical appearance does little but distract from the meager content this film contains.  It is also a (much deserved) invitation to all those rabid debunkers who like to point to the entire subject of UFO research as the domain of nuts, kooks, and those who live in the twilight zone between the real world and the world of their runaway imaginations.  Truly, Mark, if you want your opinions and the information you wish to convey to be taken as anything other than a joke, drop the Dennis Moore attire (Monty Python fans will know exactly what that means!)  Good grief, man, your viewers are all afraid you're going to rob them of their Lupins.  Put on some clothing that is at least circa twentieth century, and maybe, just maybe, someone watching will take you seriously.As to content, there is precious little of interest here.  Nevertheless, there is the tiniest smidgen, so I rated this one at 3 stars.  Production values are close to non-existent.  Anyone with a modern, digital video recorder could do a much better job with very little effort.  If this had been a project for a junior high class in cinematography, Mr. Olly would be fortunate if his instructor did not fail him for the class.  It's exceptionally amateurish.  I rated it at 3 stars, and someone could make a case with very little effort that this is far too generous a rating.  It is definitely not a $20 DVD.  One sometimes runs across videos at the bargain bin at Walmart for $2.99 or $4.99.  Maybe it would be worth it at that price, but certainly it isn't worth any more.Would I buy it again, knowing what I know of it now?  For the comedic value...  Hmmmmm... Tough call.  But, no, I have to say I would pass on this one if I had it to do again.  It certainly isn't a video I'm going to pull out and show to anyone who comes calling on me at home.",3,Nothing particularly special - just barely OK,1314489600,"08 28, 2011",2011,2241,"['lead', 'figure', 'film', 'Mark', 'Olly', 'far', 'too', 'hard', 'appear', 'mystery', 'figure', 'old', 'fashioned', 'highway', 'man', 'old', 'Britain', 'truth', 'would', 'expect', 'see', 'exactly', 'such', 'characters', 'costume', 'making', 'rounds', 'renaissance', 'unpaid', 'extra', 'set', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'lurking', 'Prancing', 'Pony', 'Inn', 'spying', 'Frodo', 'pathetically', 'quasi-comical', 'appearance', 'little', 'distract', 'meager', 'content', 'film', 'also', 'much', 'deserved', 'invitation', 'rabid', 'debunkers', 'who', 'like', 'point', 'entire', 'subject', 'UFO', 'research', 'domain', 'nuts', 'kooks', 'who', 'live', 'twilight', 'zone', 'real', 'world', 'world', 'runaway', 'imaginations', 'Truly', 'Mark', 'want', 'opinions', 'information', 'wish', 'convey', 'be', 'taken', 'anything', 'other', 'joke', 'drop', 'Dennis', 'Moore', 'attire', 'Monty', 'Python', 'fans', 'will', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'Good', 'grief', 'man', 'viewers', 'are', 'afraid', ""'re"", 'going', 'rob', 'Lupins', 'Put', 'clothing', 'least', 'circa', 'twentieth', 'century', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'someone', 'watching', 'will', 'take', 'seriously.As', 'content', 'precious', 'little', 'interest', 'here', 'Nevertheless', 'tiniest', 'smidgen', 'rated', 'one', '3', 'stars', 'Production', 'values', 'are', 'close', 'non-existent', 'Anyone', 'modern', 'digital', 'video', 'recorder', 'could', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'very', 'little', 'effort', 'had', 'been', 'project', 'junior', 'high', 'class', 'cinematography', 'Mr.', 'Olly', 'would', 'be', 'fortunate', 'instructor', 'did', 'not', 'fail', 'class', 'exceptionally', 'amateurish', 'rated', '3', 'stars', 'someone', 'could', 'make', 'case', 'very', 'little', 'effort', 'far', 'too', 'generous', 'rating', 'definitely', 'not', '20', 'DVD', 'One', 'sometimes', 'videos', 'bargain', 'bin', 'Walmart', '2.99', '4.99', 'Maybe', 'would', 'be', 'price', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'worth', 'more.Would', 'buy', 'again', 'knowing', 'what', 'know', 'now', 'comedic', 'value', 'Hmmmmm', 'Tough', 'call', 'have', 'say', 'would', 'pass', 'one', 'had', 'do', 'again', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'video', ""'m"", 'going', 'pull', 'out', 'show', 'anyone', 'who', 'calling', 'home']",EUROPE'S  ROSWELL  UFO crash in Aberystwyth
