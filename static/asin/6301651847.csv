It is the most hilariously bad movie ever created. &quot;Death Wish&quot; 1/2/3 auteur Michael Winner outdoes himself with the terrible actors and way overblown musical score by  Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones. (if you thought Jimmy Pages DW2 score was  distracting, you ain't heard nothin' yet, folks).

The presentation is a little weird, in that the film is basically a bunch of flashbacks, but we never actually get back to where we started from.  You probably won't even notice, though, thanks to the film's energetic last half hour.  Scream for Help doesn't have it all, but it does have a lot:  a mysterious death, amateur sleuthing, raunchy sex, plenty of violence, explosions, romance, and - last but not least - a pretty hot young actress (Rachael Kelly).  It also has several unintentionally humorous moments (such as the good doctor who obviously failed his bedside manner class), but I think all those little things actually make the film more endearing.  Director Michael Winner wasn't exactly working with a big budget, you know.Christie (Rachael Kelly) has had trouble adjusting to her parents' divorce and her mother's new marriage to Paul Fox (David Brooks), a smarmy fellow who used to work for his rich new wife.  She even spent some time in therapy when it all went down.  That's why no one believes her when she accuses Paul of trying to kill her mother.  Even she would admit her evidence is all circumstantial at first, but that just makes her more determined to find out what the guy is up to.  Not surprisingly, good old Paul is having an affair.  Here is where Christie makes her big mistake: after her mother refuses to believe her story, she calls Paul out in front of her.  A word to the wise - when you suspect someone of being a murderer, especially if that person lives in your own house, don't go telling him everything you've discovered.  If you do that, you're basically just inviting the guy to go ahead and kill you off, too.  As things quickly go from bad to worse, Christie has only one person taking her seriously.  That would be Josh (Corey Parker), who starts out as her best friend's boyfriend.The story gets a little more complicated as it moves along, setting the stage for a memorable last half hour in which Christie is forced to fight to keep both her mother and herself alive.  Christie has no skills whatsoever in the art of running away when the bad guys are distracted, but she is a pretty resourceful young lady who refuses to take her own murder lying down.  I love seeing girls stick it to the man.I can't say the film ever takes on an atmosphere of deep suspense, but there's just something that makes Scream for Help much more entertaining than it has any right to be.  Don't worry about the fact that the movie starts slowly and doesn't seem to be going anywhere interesting - it finds its groove about halfway through, developing into a pretty darn entertaining film.  There is still a slight ""you'll love it or you'll hate it"" aura about it, but don't let the negative reviews convince you that Scream for Help is an object of universal scorn.  I quite enjoyed this film.",4,A shiny little bauble hidden in the sands of forgotten horror/suspense films,1192492800,"10 16, 2007",2007,2943,"['Sure', 'acting', 'fair', 'middling', 'cinematography', ""n't"", 'invoke', 'oohs', 'aahs', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'presentation', 'little', 'weird', 'film', 'basically', 'bunch', 'flashbacks', 'never', 'actually', 'get', 'back', 'where', 'started', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'though', 'thanks', 'film', 'energetic', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'Scream', 'Help', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'lot', 'mysterious', 'death', 'amateur', 'sleuthing', 'raunchy', 'sex', 'plenty', 'violence', 'explosions', 'romance', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'pretty', 'hot', 'young', 'actress', 'Rachael', 'Kelly', 'also', 'several', 'unintentionally', 'humorous', 'moments', 'such', 'good', 'doctor', 'who', 'obviously', 'failed', 'bedside', 'manner', 'class', 'think', 'little', 'things', 'actually', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'endearing', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Winner', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'working', 'big', 'budget', 'know.Christie', 'Rachael', 'Kelly', 'had', 'trouble', 'adjusting', 'parents', 'divorce', 'mother', 'new', 'marriage', 'Paul', 'Fox', 'David', 'Brooks', 'smarmy', 'fellow', 'who', 'used', 'work', 'rich', 'new', 'wife', 'even', 'spent', 'time', 'therapy', 'when', 'went', 'down', 'why', 'one', 'when', 'Paul', 'trying', 'kill', 'mother', 'Even', 'would', 'admit', 'evidence', 'circumstantial', 'first', 'just', 'more', 'determined', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'guy', 'up', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'old', 'Paul', 'having', 'affair', 'Here', 'where', 'Christie', 'big', 'mistake', 'mother', 'believe', 'story', 'Paul', 'out', 'front', 'word', 'wise', 'when', 'suspect', 'someone', 'being', 'murderer', 'especially', 'person', 'own', 'house', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'telling', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'discovered', 'do', ""'re"", 'basically', 'just', 'inviting', 'guy', 'go', 'ahead', 'kill', 'off', 'too', 'things', 'quickly', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'Christie', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'taking', 'seriously', 'would', 'be', 'Josh', 'Corey', 'Parker', 'who', 'out', 'best', 'friend', 'boyfriend.The', 'story', 'little', 'more', 'complicated', 'along', 'setting', 'stage', 'memorable', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'Christie', 'forced', 'fight', 'keep', 'mother', 'alive', 'Christie', 'skills', 'whatsoever', 'art', 'running', 'away', 'when', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'distracted', 'pretty', 'resourceful', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'take', 'own', 'murder', 'lying', 'down', 'love', 'seeing', 'girls', 'stick', 'man.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'ever', 'atmosphere', 'deep', 'suspense', 'just', 'something', 'Scream', 'Help', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'right', 'be', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'fact', 'movie', 'slowly', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'going', 'anywhere', 'interesting', 'groove', 'halfway', 'developing', 'pretty', 'darn', 'entertaining', 'film', 'still', 'slight', ""'ll"", 'love', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'negative', 'reviews', 'convince', 'Scream', 'Help', 'object', 'universal', 'scorn', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'film']",Scream for He VHS
