250179,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6301334345,Acute Observer,"[0, 2]","Mississippi Burning, 1988 filmThis movie is based on a true event from 1964, the murder of three men who worked to register voters. Many say it is not historically accurate. But Hollywood produces drama and entertainment; if you want history read a book. The movie starts with burning fires, houses and trees. An automobile drives down the road at night. Other cars follow. A police car stops the first car. The people in the car are shot dead. Next we see two FBI agents driving to town to see the Sheriff about the missing persons. They stop at a restaurant to eat. [An integrated restaurant?] The questioning of an old woman tells about those times. A man is threatened if he talks. The dialogue between the two FBI men reflects opinions. A rock through a window sends a message. A call to Washington brings more agents. One agent visits a barber shop for news. License plates are checked to identify the car owners.A car drops a body on Main Street; he talked to an FBI agent! A station wagon is pulled from a swamp. Ward orders more men to search the swamp. Fire bombs destroy homes and a church! ""Whatever it takes"" to do the job. Anderson questions the Deputy Sheriff's wife. There are more dramatic scenes. There is a march in the street for freedom. They watch as a man is released from jail, then abducted and beaten. ""What's wrong with these people?"" Deputy Sheriff Pell is questioned. Newspapermen are attacked on the street. Anderson has a plan to get the facts. Four men are tried for arson, the judge suspends the sentence. Later there is another arson and attempted murder. There is a meeting of segregationists. Their license plates are recorded by the FBI. Anderson questions Pell's wife, who is unhappy about the violence.The FBI digs up the bodies of the missing men. Clinton Pell has a talk with his wife. Ward talks to her in the hospital. Now they plan to act. ""Whatever it takes."" Can an illegal abduction and threats of maiming get a witness to talk? They need a Federal crime to prosecute the guilty. The FBI picks up one man to get him to talk. Anderson talks to Clinton Pell for some dramatic scenes. There is another dramatic scene and a car chase at night. Another staged incident to try to get a witness to talk. Then we see the arrests and convictions of the guilty for Civil Rights violations. [There were more struggles for voting rights over the next decade.]You can find the real story in a good history book. The FBI did not use strong-arm tactics to get somebody to talk. $30,000 was a small fortune then, someone talked for the money. So why was this movie produced in 1988? To revise history for people who didn't know the facts? Note how this drama failed to mention Attorney-General Robert Francis Kennedy at all! Most people get their knowledge of history from Hollywood entertainment like this movie. Does it trivialize the actual events? While this crime was being investigated and publicized more important history was going on in South Vietnam. Silver coins were being removed from circulation in 1964, and later  in 1971 the dollar would no longer be linked to gold.",2,Prosecuting Civil Rights Violations,1310342400,"07 11, 2011",2011,3114,"['Mississippi', 'Burning', '1988', 'filmThis', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'event', '1964', 'murder', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'worked', 'register', 'voters', 'Many', 'say', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'Hollywood', 'drama', 'entertainment', 'want', 'history', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'burning', 'fires', 'houses', 'trees', 'automobile', 'down', 'road', 'night', 'Other', 'cars', 'follow', 'police', 'car', 'first', 'car', 'people', 'car', 'are', 'shot', 'dead', 'Next', 'see', 'two', 'FBI', 'agents', 'driving', 'town', 'see', 'Sheriff', 'missing', 'persons', 'stop', 'restaurant', 'eat', '[', 'integrated', 'restaurant', 'questioning', 'old', 'woman', 'times', 'man', 'threatened', 'dialogue', 'two', 'FBI', 'men', 'opinions', 'rock', 'window', 'message', 'call', 'Washington', 'more', 'agents', 'One', 'agent', 'barber', 'shop', 'news', 'License', 'plates', 'are', 'checked', 'identify', 'car', 'owners.A', 'car', 'body', 'Main', 'Street', 'talked', 'FBI', 'agent', 'station', 'wagon', 'pulled', 'swamp', 'Ward', 'orders', 'more', 'men', 'search', 'swamp', 'Fire', 'bombs', 'destroy', 'homes', 'church', 'do', 'job', 'Anderson', 'questions', 'Deputy', 'Sheriff', 'wife', 'are', 'more', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'march', 'street', 'freedom', 'watch', 'man', 'released', 'jail', 'then', 'abducted', 'beaten', 'What', 'wrong', 'people', 'Deputy', 'Sheriff', 'Pell', 'questioned', 'Newspapermen', 'are', 'attacked', 'street', 'Anderson', 'plan', 'get', 'facts', 'Four', 'men', 'are', 'tried', 'arson', 'judge', 'sentence', 'Later', 'arson', 'attempted', 'murder', 'meeting', 'segregationists', 'license', 'plates', 'are', 'recorded', 'FBI', 'Anderson', 'questions', 'Pell', 'wife', 'who', 'unhappy', 'violence.The', 'FBI', 'up', 'bodies', 'missing', 'men', 'Clinton', 'Pell', 'talk', 'wife', 'Ward', 'talks', 'hospital', 'Now', 'plan', 'act', 'Can', 'illegal', 'abduction', 'threats', 'maiming', 'get', 'witness', 'talk', 'need', 'Federal', 'crime', 'prosecute', 'guilty', 'FBI', 'up', 'one', 'man', 'get', 'talk', 'Anderson', 'talks', 'Clinton', 'Pell', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'car', 'chase', 'night', 'staged', 'incident', 'try', 'get', 'witness', 'talk', 'Then', 'see', 'arrests', 'convictions', 'guilty', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'violations', '[', 'were', 'more', 'struggles', 'voting', 'rights', 'next', 'decade', 'can', 'find', 'real', 'story', 'good', 'history', 'book', 'FBI', 'did', 'not', 'use', 'strong-arm', 'tactics', 'get', 'somebody', 'talk', '30,000', 'was', 'small', 'fortune', 'then', 'someone', 'talked', 'money', 'So', 'why', 'was', 'movie', 'produced', '1988', 'revise', 'history', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'facts', 'Note', 'how', 'drama', 'failed', 'mention', 'Attorney-General', 'Robert', 'Francis', 'Kennedy', 'Most', 'people', 'get', 'knowledge', 'history', 'Hollywood', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'trivialize', 'actual', 'events', 'crime', 'was', 'being', 'investigated', 'publicized', 'more', 'important', 'history', 'was', 'going', 'South', 'Vietnam', 'Silver', 'coins', 'were', 'being', 'removed', 'circulation', '1964', 'later', '1971', 'dollar', 'would', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'linked', 'gold']",N/A

250183,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301334345,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","My best friend and I had a discussion about Gene Hackman the other day, since both of us are huge fans.  We were recounting some of our favorite Hackman performances (`Unforgiven', `Hoosiers') and I was suggesting to him Hackman films he needed to see (`The Royal Tenenbaums') and he was suggesting ones I needed to see (`Crimson Tide') and then we came to the subject of `Mississippi Burning' and realized that neither of us had seen it.  So, I told him I was coming over and on my way I rented this film and we had a few beers and watched one of the best Hackman films either of us had ever seen.Not just one of his best movies; one of his best performances!`Mississippi Burning' (inspired by a true story) tells the tragic tale three young rights activists who were murdered in a small Mississippi town.  Two white boys and one black, the local police department sweeps it under the rug, but when word that the boys are missing reaches the FBI two agents are sent to the town to investigate.  Rupert Anderson is an ex-Mississippi sheriff himself and so he has a better idea of how to deal with the locals than his partner, the young and `by-the-book' agent Alan Ward.  Alan is asking all the wrong questions at the wrong time to the wrong people and is stirring up more problems than he should; but Rupert is slinking around in the background, building trust with valuable witnesses who may in the end be able to help him tie up the loose ends.The film is brilliantly crafted, building tension in all the right places and balancing out the violence with a brutal message of injustice and tolerance.  There are so many technical aspects of this film that really grabbed me, like the use of gospel hymns during some of the more savage scenes; creating a mood, an air of melancholy as apposed to brutality.  It is small touches like that that bring the film to another level, eliciting in the audience the desired emotional response.  Sure, we are angered by what it taking place, but our anger is more repressed and tempered.  We wind up more saddened and disappointed which, in my opinion, carries the weight of the film farther than just steeping our reaction in pure hatred.Like Alan Ward brings to light towards the films closing; we are all guilty if we allow atrocities like this to happen; if we say nothing when we know we have the obligation to stand up for what we know is right.The film is strengthened also by the marvelous performances that litter the screen, most notably by the two Oscar nominees; Gene Hackman and Frances McDormand.  Frances is not on the screen for a very long time, but her control over her character is dominant.  You can really feel her emotional connection to Mrs. Pell, her struggle to find steady ground as she tries to decide where her loyalties need to be staked.  Gene Hackman is seriously at the top of his game here, delivering what may be his finest performance ever.  I love the transformation his character makes, and this is seen in one particular scene where he joins a few suspects for a beer.""Thanks for the beer.""The rest of the cast is equally impressive, from Willem Dafoe's stubborn take on Ward to Brad Dourif's devilishly squirmy Clinton Pell.  R. Lee Ermey is magnificent as the corrupt Mayor and supporting players like Sartain, Rooker and especially Tobolowsky clutter the film with brilliance.The film is an acting goldmine.In the end I highly recommend this brilliant film.  There is such a dark yet poignant message here that to me is universal.  This is one of those films that, while broaching one particular subject, really opens itself up to a universally important message.  The film is not merely a film about racism but a film about injustice and the obligation each living breathing human has to right wrongs, no matter how inconvenient that may be.  This film is one that we do well to take to heart.",5,A poignant film highlighting our rights to justice...,1224460800,"10 20, 2008",2008,3874,"['best', 'friend', 'had', 'discussion', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'other', 'day', 'are', 'huge', 'fans', 'were', 'recounting', 'favorite', 'Hackman', 'performances', 'Unforgiven', 'Hoosiers', 'was', 'suggesting', 'Hackman', 'films', 'needed', 'see', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'was', 'suggesting', 'ones', 'needed', 'see', 'Crimson', 'Tide', 'then', 'came', 'subject', 'Mississippi', 'Burning', 'realized', 'had', 'seen', 'So', 'told', 'was', 'coming', 'over', 'way', 'rented', 'film', 'had', 'few', 'beers', 'watched', 'one', 'best', 'Hackman', 'had', 'ever', 'seen.Not', 'just', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Mississippi', 'Burning', 'inspired', 'true', 'story', 'tragic', 'tale', 'three', 'young', 'rights', 'activists', 'who', 'were', 'murdered', 'small', 'Mississippi', 'town', 'Two', 'white', 'boys', 'one', 'black', 'local', 'police', 'department', 'rug', 'when', 'word', 'boys', 'are', 'missing', 'reaches', 'FBI', 'two', 'agents', 'are', 'sent', 'town', 'investigate', 'Rupert', 'Anderson', 'ex-Mississippi', 'sheriff', 'so', 'better', 'idea', 'how', 'deal', 'locals', 'partner', 'young', 'by-the-book', 'agent', 'Alan', 'Ward', 'Alan', 'asking', 'wrong', 'questions', 'wrong', 'time', 'wrong', 'people', 'stirring', 'up', 'more', 'problems', 'should', 'Rupert', 'slinking', 'around', 'background', 'building', 'trust', 'valuable', 'witnesses', 'who', 'may', 'end', 'be', 'able', 'help', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends.The', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'crafted', 'building', 'tension', 'right', 'places', 'balancing', 'out', 'violence', 'brutal', 'message', 'injustice', 'tolerance', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'really', 'grabbed', 'use', 'gospel', 'hymns', 'more', 'savage', 'scenes', 'creating', 'mood', 'air', 'melancholy', 'apposed', 'brutality', 'small', 'touches', 'bring', 'film', 'level', 'eliciting', 'audience', 'desired', 'emotional', 'response', 'Sure', 'are', 'angered', 'what', 'taking', 'place', 'anger', 'more', 'repressed', 'tempered', 'wind', 'up', 'more', 'saddened', 'disappointed', 'opinion', 'weight', 'film', 'farther', 'just', 'steeping', 'reaction', 'pure', 'hatred.Like', 'Alan', 'Ward', 'light', 'towards', 'films', 'closing', 'are', 'guilty', 'allow', 'atrocities', 'happen', 'say', 'nothing', 'when', 'know', 'have', 'obligation', 'stand', 'up', 'what', 'know', 'right.The', 'film', 'strengthened', 'also', 'marvelous', 'performances', 'litter', 'screen', 'most', 'notably', 'two', 'Oscar', 'nominees', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Frances', 'not', 'screen', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'control', 'character', 'dominant', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'emotional', 'connection', 'Mrs.', 'Pell', 'struggle', 'find', 'steady', 'ground', 'decide', 'where', 'loyalties', 'need', 'be', 'staked', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'seriously', 'top', 'game', 'here', 'delivering', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'finest', 'performance', 'ever', 'love', 'transformation', 'character', 'seen', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'where', 'few', 'suspects', 'beer', 'Thanks', 'beer', 'rest', 'cast', 'equally', 'impressive', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'stubborn', 'take', 'Ward', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'devilishly', 'squirmy', 'Clinton', 'Pell', 'R.', 'Lee', 'Ermey', 'magnificent', 'corrupt', 'Mayor', 'supporting', 'players', 'Sartain', 'Rooker', 'especially', 'Tobolowsky', 'clutter', 'film', 'brilliance.The', 'film', 'acting', 'goldmine.In', 'end', 'highly', 'recommend', 'brilliant', 'film', 'such', 'dark', 'yet', 'poignant', 'message', 'here', 'universal', 'one', 'films', 'broaching', 'one', 'particular', 'subject', 'really', 'up', 'universally', 'important', 'message', 'film', 'not', 'merely', 'film', 'racism', 'film', 'injustice', 'obligation', 'living', 'breathing', 'human', 'right', 'wrongs', 'matter', 'how', 'inconvenient', 'may', 'be', 'film', 'one', 'do', 'well', 'take', 'heart']",N/A
250184,A1OH145PO8YKDM,6301334345,"Anton Batey ""Anton_Batey@yahoo.com""","[20, 22]","This is a great movie on the grounds that Jim Crow Mississippi was a fascist state, where Blacks were subjected to second-class ""citizenship"" (or, as Malcolm X rightfully called ""20th Century Slaves"").  THAT historical viewpoint was correct.  However, like nearly all Hollywood films depicting historical events (Like Nixon, JFK, Malcolm X, etc), the writers and directors can't help but to add Hollywood in the films.  The way Chaney, Schwerner and Goodman died was way off.  They weren't simply shot (as if THAT'S not bad enough), the three kids were dragged out the car, and beat with chains, pistol whipped, and the scum who carried out the murder made them beg for their lives...then shot them.  This movie totally romanticized the role the FBI played in their forced ""fight"" against the Klan.  When the FBI witnessed crimes, and police brutality, all they did was take notes, and did nothing else.  Also, the Black people were so impersonal.  Though the movie revolved around their treatment, they just stood in the background as impersonal objects.  Don't get me wrong now; I think EVERYONE should see this movie.  Just know that Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney were not at all protected by the FBI, and that it took a mass movement for the government to finally cave in (or there REALLY would have been trouble in the streets) and pass a so-called ""Civil Rights Bill"" that took only 100 years to sign.  The actors in the movie were excellent.  Hackman was great.  Dafoe was great.  It made you mad, sad and happy.  Definitely see the movie.  Just don't take it as a historical reference.  Watch Murder in Mississippi to find out the lives of the three, and what they did.  Also, read Three Lives for Mississippi.One last thing, I hope that SOB Edgar Ray Killen faces a death squad.  In case you don't know, Killen was the one who orchestrated the murder of Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner, and was conviced exactly 41 years after the act committed on June 21st, 1964.Anton Batey",4,FBI romanticized ...but still great,1139443200,"02 9, 2006",2006,1982,"['great', 'movie', 'grounds', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'Mississippi', 'was', 'fascist', 'state', 'where', 'Blacks', 'were', 'subjected', 'second-class', 'citizenship', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'rightfully', 'called', '20th', 'Century', 'Slaves', 'historical', 'viewpoint', 'was', 'correct', 'However', 'nearly', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'depicting', 'historical', 'events', 'Nixon', 'JFK', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'etc', 'writers', 'directors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'add', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'way', 'Chaney', 'Schwerner', 'Goodman', 'died', 'was', 'way', 'were', ""n't"", 'simply', 'shot', 'not', 'bad', 'enough', 'three', 'kids', 'were', 'dragged', 'out', 'car', 'beat', 'chains', 'pistol', 'whipped', 'scum', 'who', 'carried', 'out', 'murder', 'made', 'beg', 'lives', 'then', 'shot', 'movie', 'totally', 'romanticized', 'role', 'FBI', 'played', 'forced', 'fight', 'Klan', 'When', 'FBI', 'witnessed', 'crimes', 'police', 'brutality', 'did', 'was', 'take', 'notes', 'did', 'nothing', 'else', 'Also', 'Black', 'people', 'were', 'so', 'impersonal', 'movie', 'revolved', 'treatment', 'just', 'stood', 'background', 'impersonal', 'objects', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'now', 'think', 'EVERYONE', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'Just', 'know', 'Goodman', 'Schwerner', 'Chaney', 'were', 'not', 'protected', 'FBI', 'took', 'mass', 'movement', 'government', 'finally', 'cave', 'REALLY', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'trouble', 'streets', 'pass', 'so-called', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Bill', 'took', 'only', '100', 'years', 'sign', 'actors', 'movie', 'were', 'excellent', 'Hackman', 'was', 'great', 'Dafoe', 'was', 'great', 'made', 'mad', 'sad', 'happy', 'Definitely', 'see', 'movie', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'historical', 'reference', 'Watch', 'Murder', 'Mississippi', 'find', 'out', 'lives', 'three', 'what', 'did', 'Also', 'read', 'Three', 'Lives', 'Mississippi.One', 'last', 'thing', 'hope', 'SOB', 'Edgar', 'Ray', 'Killen', 'death', 'squad', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Killen', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'orchestrated', 'murder', 'Goodman', 'Chaney', 'Schwerner', 'was', 'conviced', 'exactly', '41', 'years', 'act', 'committed', 'June', '21st', '1964.Anton', 'Batey']",N/A

Vegan,"[3, 3]","This movie makes some claim about being based on true events (the Goodman, Cheney and Schwerner murders of 1964) but essentially it's about racism, or more specifically the peculiar brand preached and practiced in the southern states at the time. Mississippi Burning succeeds not because it retells history or moralises, takes sides or casts judgments, but because its portrayal of this racism is deep and palpable. You can almost feel irrational hatred and bigotry glaring from the screen at times: the characters, while a little clich&eacute;d and mostly one-dimensional, are as you might expect them to have been.The stand-out performance comes from Hackman as Anderson, the former Mississippi sheriff turned FBI investigator: a character of much greater complexity than any other in the film, Anderson has to confront his own upbringing, deal with the determined but pig-headedly officious Ward (Dafoe) and resist his natural urges to throttle confessions out of the murderers. He alternates from frivolous jokester, taking the investigation only half-seriously, to passionate and determined lawman, to shuffling and bashful schoolboy when in the presence of Mrs. Pell. I've never seen Hackman put in a bad performance and he outshines everyone else in this movie.The film is nicely shot: the sets are prosaic, everyday types of places, the costumes are effective (FBI agents in stovepipe suits standout clumsily) and the screenplay is terrific, though lacking subtlety in places. If I had a criticism of Mississippi Burning it's that no black character is explored in much depth; the crusading is carried out by white northerners and the Negroes are just towed along behind the narrative, looking sad, oppressed and rather impotent. However that doesn't detract from the overall impact of what is a well-crafted piece of cinema.",4,Where does hatred come from?,1125187200,"08 28, 2005",2005,1833,"['movie', 'claim', 'being', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'Goodman', 'Cheney', 'Schwerner', 'murders', '1964', 'racism', 'more', 'specifically', 'peculiar', 'brand', 'preached', 'practiced', 'southern', 'states', 'time', 'Mississippi', 'Burning', 'not', 'history', 'moralises', 'sides', 'casts', 'judgments', 'portrayal', 'racism', 'deep', 'palpable', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'irrational', 'hatred', 'bigotry', 'glaring', 'screen', 'times', 'characters', 'little', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'mostly', 'one-dimensional', 'are', 'might', 'expect', 'have', 'been.The', 'stand-out', 'performance', 'Hackman', 'Anderson', 'former', 'Mississippi', 'sheriff', 'turned', 'FBI', 'investigator', 'character', 'much', 'greater', 'complexity', 'other', 'film', 'Anderson', 'confront', 'own', 'upbringing', 'deal', 'determined', 'pig-headedly', 'officious', 'Ward', 'Dafoe', 'resist', 'natural', 'urges', 'throttle', 'confessions', 'murderers', 'frivolous', 'jokester', 'taking', 'investigation', 'only', 'half-seriously', 'passionate', 'determined', 'lawman', 'shuffling', 'bashful', 'schoolboy', 'when', 'presence', 'Mrs.', 'Pell', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Hackman', 'put', 'bad', 'performance', 'everyone', 'else', 'movie.The', 'film', 'nicely', 'shot', 'sets', 'are', 'prosaic', 'everyday', 'types', 'places', 'costumes', 'are', 'effective', 'FBI', 'agents', 'stovepipe', 'suits', 'standout', 'clumsily', 'screenplay', 'terrific', 'lacking', 'subtlety', 'places', 'had', 'criticism', 'Mississippi', 'Burning', 'black', 'character', 'explored', 'much', 'depth', 'crusading', 'carried', 'out', 'white', 'northerners', 'Negroes', 'are', 'just', 'towed', 'narrative', 'looking', 'sad', 'oppressed', 'rather', 'impotent', 'However', ""n't"", 'detract', 'overall', 'impact', 'what', 'well-crafted', 'piece', 'cinema']",N/A

But that doesn't lessen the impact of this movie. In many ways you feel Mississippi during the era involved. Not just in the politics and bigotry, but in the countryside presented itself. There are some subtle allusions that assist in creating a feel for the town this movie takes place in. Gene Hackman and William DaFoe are fabulous in their lead roles, as is Frances McDormand. But to me, the real reason to watch this movie is the incomparable collection of character actors, my favorite movie in that category. it's a treasure trove. You can debate the angle of many of the most popular civil rights movies, their message, be it explicit or implied. But the performances by this ensemble cast and the backdrop of Mississippi make this one of the most watchable movies of the genre. From R. Lee Ermey (Gunnery Sgt. in ""Full Metal Jacket"") and Stephen Tobolowski (Needle Nose Ned in ""Groundhog Day"") - 2 of the most renowned character actors playing the mayor and Clayton Townley, head of the Klan, respectively- to Brad Dourif, Michael Rooker, Gailard Sartain, Pruitt Taylor Vince- all playing loathsome bigots. Tobin Bell will be a familiar face as well in his small role as an FBI agent in the latter part of the film. Even James F. Moore who plays a simple barber with a pittance for dialogue is essential to the feel of this moving film. It's the character actors who steal this show. it's an outstanding film with crystal clear DVD remastering in sound and quality, There are several memorable scenes integral to the story (Hackman's encounter with Frank Bailey at ""the club"") and naturally the scenes that accompany such a film that stir the audience into righteous outrage. For the purposes of this movie, everything and everybody clicks. There are some gripping behind the scene stories as to the extent actors like the great Stephen Tobolowski went to dig into their roles, making their performances all the more effective and proven on the final print. When I started buying DVDs, this was on the top of my list. It's a steal at the often found bargain price.",5,A great movie.

The subject matter was explosive, but not as much as in the book Mary Winstead wrote almost a decade after the movie was released.  In it, she searches for the truth of what happen in her father's homestate of Mississippi.She simplifies the location of this horrific crime which happened on June 21, 1964, because as she said, 'the nation had ignored what was happening there for more than a century.' ""Ever since the Civil War, the South has had people pointing fingers at them and telling them they're wrong and there's naturally resentment. Nobody likes that.""She claims that her fidelity to her Southern heritage allowed her to ""explore the roots of hatred, fear, and ignorance which caused people to commit the unthinkable in the context of a family, a community and even a nation that didn't want to admit it was happening."" She feels guilty in a way, writing ""If I could, I'd erase all the painful things discovered in my family."" Her assertion that the residents there in Meridian believed that the whole thing was a ""hoax,"" is interesting.Her father's secretiveness about his past and family in Mississippi was a necessary evil, even though he had left that area in 1940. She'd visited her relatives there first when she was thirteen years old; fourteen years later, she returns with her young children. This time, they came through Memphis, TN, in 1982 when Knoxville had the World's Fair.Her father, coming from rural Mississippi, had an unsatisfied wanderlust and gambled to cover his restlessness and feeling of being unanchored, so far away from his life on the farm a thousand miles south if you follow the map through Louisiana. She tells the family history of her father in fragments, visualizing photographs, and using a selective memory behind the wall of consciousness hiding pertinent secret facts. The cover photo shows a typical small town in the South. It could be many places but, with the railroad track beside the main part of town, I think of Tullahoma, TN, where they have the same phenomenon for several blocks in the middle of town.The obsolete places where you could order all the fried catfish (there's nothing better!) you could eat are still alive and thriving in North Alabama, just across the TN line. Of course, the price is no longer just a dollar! Her description of a long gone roadhouse without a name, just the word CAFE stenciled in big letters across the side could be in Middlesboro, KY, today.Like me, she had the false impression that antebellum meant a big Southern plantation house with tall white pillars across the front. After all, that's the way the South was presented in the movie, 'Gone With the Wind.' In Knoxville, an old brick building downtown (no pillars anywhere) is being renovated to its original shape, and I was told it was one of the few existing antebellum houses left standing in this town. I couldn't believe it, as it was as far from a plantation home as anything could be. My source, a history researcher, explained that antebellum means ""before the (Civil) war."" How foolish I felt. But that's the image her father drew with his comment, ""The closest we ever got to antebellum.""Since I am a KAT bus rider, I could appreciate her version of how her mother got around her hometown (when the father was not playing Chauffeur): the #6 bus would take her north to her mother's in Linden Hills, or on downtown to the doctor's office and other places she frequented; southward, it went to a Mall in Edina, where her father worked.She speaks of living on the right side of the tracks and described one of the racial demarcation lines, separating the whites from the blacks. Even though Knoxville is in the South, I too grew up in a segregated environment not so different from hers. She grew up in Minneapolis in the 1950-60s, and recalls ""I'd had no firsthand contact with anyone of color."" Her awareness of racial issues was limited to what she saw on television. But Mississippi apparently was different.She relates how bootlegging was under the control of the sheriff's office for decades, delivering liquor to the roadhouses in the trunks of patrol cars -- and how rapes, murders and other crimes were ignored or not investigated. If local history is correct, this town where I lived almost drown in the liquor industry in those early years. Now, it seems to be getting legal again as many drinking places are on the main street of town and the drinkers sit out on the sidewalk to partake of their favorite beverage.She had to delve deeply and cause bad feelings in her search for the truth, a truth better left hidden. In 1997, researching her heritage, she discovers 'parts of the family history that everyone would just as soon forget.' When delving too deeply, she learned secrets about the civil rights murder which had happened thirty years earlier, she was snubbed by her father's family. So why did she persist? What is right about revealing injustices from a personal viewpoint with embarrassing family secrets? What's the purpose of airing 'dirty laundry' in public -- most families have if you look deep enough.This memoir written by an English teacher in her hometown of Minneapolis, Minnesota, is disturbing as she looks back at her paternal roots in Mississippi and considers the South as being the same as the homeplace of her father.To show that the turbulent times as depicted in this movie still existed much later in time, I have used this means to fulfill a goal.",4,The South in Turbulent Times.,1102636800,"12 10, 2004",2004,5530,"['One', 'producer', 'stated', 'movie', 'was', 'best', 'decade',

250191,A38B1TAM6HZOXA,6301334345,B. J Robbins,"[6, 6]","Gene Hackman is probably the most underrated actor in Hollywood.  To every role he brings passion, humanity and believability. I can't imagine any other actor playing the role of ""Mr. Anderson"" (I can hear Willem Dafoe saying it) as effectively as he does.As noted, the film is based on an actual event, the murders of Mickey Schwerner, Andrew Goodman, and James Cheney, young civil rights activists trying to register blacks to vote.  From what I know about the South in those days, it is a pretty accurate depiction. The hatred, the refusal to change (integrate), the two separate societies was all there. Little Rock, Univ. of Alabama, Central High School, these horrors could be watched on TV.  The Southern racists in the movie are so beneath contempt that they risk becoming straw men, a possible weaknesses.Certainly Mr. Anderson was right that the malefactors could never be charged with murder in a state court and be found guilty (unless somehow they obtained a change of venue, an unlikely event).  Do the ends justify the means?  When the FBI agents try to find the murderers the old-fashioned way, they meet solid walls of opposition: blacks afraid of retribution if they tell what they know, and whites who button up to protect themselves. So the DaFoe character finally takes Mr. Anderson's advice to ""do whatever it takes"" to put the murderers behind bars. Is Pauline Kael correct to dismiss this as ""vigilantism""? Well, it is a legitimate objection (the DaFoe character  reminds Mr. Anderson that the coerced confession he just obtained from the town's mayor violated his civil rights and will be inadmissible in court! Hot damn!).  Mr. Anderson observes ""These people crawled out of the gutter! Maybe it's time we got in there with them!"" Well, they have more tricks up their sleeves, and obtain other evidence against them.It is a wonderful script, with taut, exciting dialogue, and the conflict between Hackman and DaFoe is the stuff of powerful drama. This is a gut-wrenching film, not for the timid, with wonderful performances by all involved.

250192,A30TQET02FLSUX,6301334345,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[1, 1]","One of the most important movies in the last 25 years, and in the history of cinema itself,  is director Alan Parker's masterpiece on racism in the south in the 1960's. Mississippi Burning (1988) is not only an incredible piece of cinema with some of the most engaging and emotional writing, acting, music, and visuals, it's also a chilling and violent reminder of the absolutely disgusting behavior that human beings are possible of committing. Mississippi Burning shows us an embarrassing part of our American history, just like Schindler's List (1993) shows the equivalent for our world history. Both films do so in a respectful and powerful manner that also shows the love and acceptance that we are capable of when we fight for it and stand up to what we ultimately realize is wrong.This movie is controversial and serious, not exactly a movie one goes to for an escape like movies are so often used for. But movies like this are also one of the most important ways we share and communicate our history in a way that hopefully prevents us from repeating it. While a documentary about the same events in Mississippi Burning could be powerful, its the raw emotional drama and conflict of this film that permanently brands itself on the heart and minds of its viewers. I believe movies like Mississippi Burning not only reflect on our culture, but actually change it forever. I've watched this film at least a dozen times over the past 23 years and I never tire of watching it again. I'm always reminded that my words and my actions as a human being have consequences and influences not only on myself, but on society as a whole. This film is still as relevant, important and interesting today as it was when it came out, and will be for many years to come. And it definitely deserves a stellar remastering and release on blu-ray, hopefully from The Criterion Collection.Led by Gene Hackman, Willem Dafoe, and Frances McDormand, Mississippi Burning is cinematic drama at its best. Hackman is absolutely brilliant, right alongside his incredible performances in Hoosiers (1986), Class Action (1991), and Unforgiven (1992). While he lost out to Dustin Hoffman, who won the Academy Award in 1989 for Best Actor, Hackman was nominated for his lead role in Mississippi Burning and was certainly deserving of winning the Oscar for this role. As Hackman's FBI superior and partner in solving the murders at the center of the story, Dafoe shows every bit of why he is one of the great male actors of his generation as well. The bitter rivalry and unity juxtaposed between these two characters makes for chewy dialogue and thrilling scenes. The chemistry between these two actors and their characters is always palpable, and while they may disagree on how to solve the issues of racism, murder, and violence, they are united on the cause to end them. Frances McDormand, as the Sheriff's Deputy's wife, is the quiet, subtle, southern lady that we would expect, torn between her internal moral beliefs and the external circumstances she is forced to reckon with. Her character's courage and strength comes out over the course of the film and binds you to the complexity of these issues and the amazing fact that we've worked our way through them as well as we have.The script by Chris Gerolmo is extremely well-written with juicy dialogue that pops and sizzles on the screen and feels completely genuine and appropriate. A more conservative writer, and director, might not choose to use the harsh language that was actually used during these times. Gerolmo and director Alan Parker both embrace those words, such as the N-word, as hard as it is to hear them, because they know that this is the only way to communicate on a visceral level that will have a lasting impact on viewers. The ideas, mindsets, words, actions, and behavior of the people portrayed in this movie in the 1960's needs to be real and accurate in order to portray the hard truths of why racism has been so hard to overcome. When I watch this film, part of me feels proud of how far we've come in the last 50 years, but another part of me feels like we still have a long way to go. Because some of the ideas, mindsets and language in this film are still out there in our culture and around the world. That's a testament to the writing by Chris Gerolmo and the storytelling craft of Parker.Winning the Best Cinematography Oscar in 1989, Mississippi Burning is an incredible looking movie. The production design and photography are completely real, with the time period flawlessly portrayed through the sets, locations, costumes, makeup, and all the other details in the film. While the editing has a few minor flaws that I notice now simply because of my numerous viewings, they never distract you for long because the story keeps moving at a perfect pace. While you might think that a movie like this would be tough to get through at over 2 hours, it zips along fast for me every time, even when I know what's coming up. And a big part of the reason it moves so well, is the score. Music composer Trevor Jones put together one of the most finely matched movie scores of all time. The tone and beats of the music are just so perfectly paired with the editing and the storytelling that it makes me tear up every single time when its supposed to. It's one of the deepest and darkest musical scores, with its often repeating elements that are played over and over again. But that repetition works so well because it ties the various scenes and elements of the film together over its entirety. It's really hard to even discuss it, but when you experience it, you know what I mean.Obviously I have a passion for this film and it occupies a high place in my list of the best movies of all time. It's in my Top 50 and I give the film 5 out of 5 stars. I just can't see any way this film could be any better. There's nothing missing and it is perfect for the story it tells. There really are no equivalent films on this subject matter in my opinion. And if by some chance you or your children haven't seen this film, it's an important viewing (at the appropriate age and maturity level), so that we never see two drinking fountains side by side again they way we do in the opening shot of Mississippi Burning.",5,One of the best and most important movies of the past 25 years,1294790400,"01 12, 2011",2011,6260,"['One', 'most', 'important', 'movies',

250194,A95SF04RX9G8,6301334345,"Christopher Moyer ""moyer.privatjokr.com""","[34, 37]","Mississippi Burning captures the American South of the 1960s and its turbulent race relations by telling a story that, while technically fictional, is inspired by actual events that took place. It succeeds by all at once being gripping, emotional, and contemplative. Despite being made in 1988 and taking place in 1964, the film holds up to this day quite well.The story begins with the murder of three young civil rights activists--two of them white and one of them black--in a small town in Mississippi. Two FBI agents are soon assigned to this as a missing persons case; these are, as they formally refer one another, Mr. Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Mr. Ward (Willem Dafoe). Ward is the younger of the two, and also the agent in charge of the case. The local law enforcement and the town in general is hesitant to accept these big shots from up north, and their views don't much change when Ward decides they need a lot more men, and that this is more than just a simple missing persons case.The Ku Klux Klan factors prominently into the case, but Anderson and Ward don't have much means for proving that they had any involvement, let alone which members, if any, contributed to the crime. It doesn't help much that nobody in town seems to want to help out--white or black. The FBI men are a little surprised to see such segregation and bigotry still taking place, but trying to explain it to some of the people in town is like trying to sell a newspaper to a dog. Ward's by-the-book style of gathering information isn't exactly producing the results he had hoped, and as a last resort, he decides to allow Anderson to use his more unconventional ways to get some answers out of some suspects.The film is filled with a veritable who's who of That Guys, actors whose faces you recognize, but whose names you don't always know: R. Lee Ermey, Stephen Tobolowsky, Brad Dourif, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Michael Rooker, and Kevin Dunn. All of these men deliver consistently solid supporting work, as does the always-perfect Frances McDormand as the benevolent wife of a Klansman deputy.Mississippi Burning, while a compelling thriller, drives for something deeper-seeded than a whodunit mystery. In fact, it pretty much gives away the mystery in the first scene. Instead, we get a study on race relations, and director Alan Parker explores the motivations and mentality of white people who persecute others based solely on the color of their skin. For some reason, these people have it burned into their minds that color of skin dictates social rank and intelligence, when nothing could be further from the truth. It would be nice to say that this sort of thinking has been abolished in our country, but that's still not the case. It has died down considerably, but it is not completely gone, and that's a real shame.",4,Gripping look at 1960s race relations,1114905600,"05 1, 2005",2005,2810,"['Mississippi', 'Burning', 'American', 'South', '1960s', 'turbulent', 'race', 'relations', 'telling', 'story', 'technically', 'fictional', 'inspired', 'actual', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'once', 'being', 'gripping', 'emotional', 'contemplative', 'being', 'made', '1988', 'taking', 'place', '1964', 'film', 'up', 'day', 'quite', 'well.The', 'story', 'murder', 'three', 'young', 'civil', 'rights', 'activists', 'two', 'white', 'one', 'black', 'small', 'town', 'Mississippi', 'Two', 'FBI', 'agents', 'are', 'soon', 'assigned', 'missing', 'persons', 'case', 'are', 'formally', 'refer', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Anderson', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Mr.', 'Ward', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Ward', 'younger', 'two', 'also', 'agent', 'charge', 'case', 'local', 'law', 'enforcement', 'town', 'general', 'hesitant', 'accept', 'big', 'shots', 'north', 'views', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'change', 'when', 'Ward', 'need', 'lot', 'more', 'men', 'more', 'just', 'simple', 'missing', 'persons', 'case.The', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'factors', 'prominently', 'case', 'Anderson', 'Ward', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'means', 'proving', 'had', 'involvement', 'let', 'alone', 'members', 'contributed', 'crime', ""n't"", 'help', 'much', 'nobody', 'town', 'want', 'help', 'out', 'white', 'black', 'FBI', 'men', 'are', 'little', 'surprised', 'see', 'such', 'segregation', 'bigotry', 'still', 'taking', 'place', 'trying', 'explain', 'people', 'town', 'trying', 'sell', 'newspaper', 'dog', 'Ward', 'by-the-book', 'style', 'gathering', 'information', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'producing', 'results', 'had', 'hoped', 'last', 'resort', 'allow', 'Anderson', 'use', 'more', 'unconventional', 'ways', 'get', 'answers', 'suspects.The', 'film', 'filled', 'veritable', 'who', 'who', 'Guys', 'actors', 'recognize', 'names', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'know', 'R.', 'Lee', 'Ermey', 'Stephen', 'Tobolowsky', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'Pruitt', 'Taylor', 'Vince', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'Kevin', 'Dunn', 'men', 'deliver', 'consistently', 'solid', 'supporting', 'work', 'always-perfect', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'benevolent', 'wife', 'Klansman', 'deputy.Mississippi', 'Burning', 'compelling', 'thriller', 'drives', 'something', 'deeper-seeded', 'whodunit', 'mystery', 'fact', 'pretty', 'much', 'away', 'mystery', 'first', 'scene', 'Instead', 'get', 'study', 'race', 'relations', 'director', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'motivations', 'mentality', 'white', 'people', 'who', 'persecute', 'others', 'based', 'solely', 'color', 'skin', 'reason', 'people', 'have', 'burned', 'minds', 'color', 'skin', 'dictates', 'social', 'rank', 'intelligence', 'when', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'say', 'sort', 'thinking', 'been', 'abolished', 'country', 'still', 'not', 'case', 'died', 'down', 'considerably', 'not', 'completely', 'gone', 'real', 'shame']",N/A

It stars Gene Hackman and Willam Dafoe.  This provacative true story explores a Mississippi town that suffers terrorism from the Ku Klux Klan and other citizens.  As two FBI  agents investigate the disappearance of three Civil Rights activists, tensions between most of the town and they turn life threatening.  Even the town police system and the sheriff try to stop the FBI agents.  This film entails deeply how racism affects a nation.  Its strong intensity has the impact to force a reality check to many audiences.Its brilliant plot wonderfully presents itself throughout the film.  Its strong emotion wonderfully honors those victims as it should.  Some may consider this piece an educational film.  Its shock value hits audiences in the level it should.  The research of the events and racism itself is always present, including conservative town surroundings that blend with the 1964 styles.  The great performances from Hackman, Dafoe, and Frances McDormand capitalize the plot's powerful effect.  Without them, this film wouldn't have the same meaningful theme.Such tremendous film quality makes ""Mississippi Burning"" a guaranteed audience pleaser.  After many years, its theme never loses its meaning regardless number of viewings.

The film is well made with a strong sense of place and the acting is uniformly brilliant, but it is fundamentally flawed because of its lack of black characters.  This film basically presents the civil rights struggle as the story of white people trying to sort out how they should treat black people.  Relegating black characters to being the backdrop for a white dilemma is disrespectful and presents an unbalanced portrait of the situation.  Having said that, I must also acknowledge that the film does a good job of presenting a chilling and knowing portrait of white racism as the unfocused and uncomprehending rage that is the result of ignorance, poverty, and self-loathing.  Frances McDormand gives a strong, nuanced performance as a shy, beaten down woman who turns out to be the key to breaking the case.

As Wayne Perryman reminds us in his book, &quot;Unfounded Loyalties&quot;,&quot;One party and their abolitionist supporters believed the Bible instructed them to lay down their lives for the slaves, the other party and their supporters believed the Bible gave them the right to take the lives of blacks if they rebelled against being slaves.&quot;On the issue of slavery, one party and its supporters gave their lives to expand it (to Northern states) and the other party and their supporters gave their lives to ban it.&quot;One party was heavily influenced by the Abolitionists and the radical wing of their party ... and the other party was influenced by the Ku Klux Klan and other terrorist groups.&quot;One party and its supporters started the Freedman's Bureau and other programs to help build communities for blacks, the other party and their supporters engaged in practices to hinder those efforts and to destroy those communities (Wilmington, North Carolina).&quot;One party and its supporters established quality schools and colleges for blacks, the other party and their supporters engaged in practices that attempted to close some of those schools or diminish their quality.&quot;One party passed laws and Constitutional Amendments (13th , 14th , 15th) to include blacks as part of mainstream society, the other party passed laws to exclude them from the mainstream (Jim Crow Laws and Black Codes). ...&quot;Sadly, many do not know that that &quot;one party&quot; was the Republican Party, while the &quot;other party&quot; was the Democratic Party. I myself didn't know at the time I watched this stirring film. I suppose burning crosses make us assume the bad guys are aligned with the religious right. Unfortunately, the &quot;other party&quot; used a nonsensical interpretation of the &quot;curse of Ham&quot; to justify slavery; fortunately, &quot;one party&quot; saw through it.This film is also a great example of how history is being rewritten or dumbed down. While many films have shown lynchings and other abuse of African Americans, they usually leave you with the impression that the bigots were &quot;Bible bashers&quot; ... as you can see, this is only half the truth. Very rarely are we reminded that it was Republicans who laid their lives on the line to defend blacks, based on their Christian faith.Willem Dafoe is, as always, fascinating to watch. His gesture of futility during Hackman's interrogation of a suspect is priceless.

Despite the fact that we were 14 and the film is rated 18 over here in the UK, which was totally illegal and would never be allowed now. The other thing I remember was Trevor Jones' really cool-sounding Ry Cooder inspired score.Since this film was loosely based on the 1964 killings of 3 Civil Rights activists, one of whom only got sentenced a few days ago, 40 years after the crime, I thought it would be appropriate to check the film out again.It's got a good story and is well acted, especially by Hackman, who is one of my fave actors (Dafoe is too but he's not in much these days). They play two FBI Agents, who don't get on (a popular clich&eacute; at the time), down in a backwoods southern town looking for three kids who have probably been killed by evil KKK members.The villains are despicable and Brad Dourif once again uses his wild eyes to great effect. But I was a little disappointed that none of them really got what they deserved (even though in real life it took 40 years to get justice) and got let-off with minor sentences, none of them over 10 years for the brutal killing of three people and all the mass-destruction and arson they did.I was let-down by the ending and really wanted more red-neck, dirt-faced, hicka-billies getting their heads kicked in.

There are movies that stink to high heaven getting 4 and 1/2 stars and even five. Incredible. Mississippi Burning is a very hard film to look at but a very truthful and gritty look at racism in southern Mississippi during the Civil Rights era.The story details FBI agents Rupert Anderson(Gene Hackman)and Alan Ward(Willem Dafoe) search for the killers an African-American male and two Jewish males. Their search takes them to the heart of Mississippi where the  racism is deep-seated and the police are inflexible to a fault. They later realize how deep the police involvement in the killings were.No other movie about race relations has moved me like Mississippi Burning has. American History X is phenomenal but it didnt make me as angry as this movie did. I wish I had the power to stop these psychos from doing what they did. Mississippi Burning was the movie that made me question my faith in organized religion. I couldn't fathom that I was believing in the same belief system that these lunatics were believing in. I dumped belief in organized religions after extensive research at the age of 20 but this movie sparked my curiosity. Gene Hackman is wonderful as Agent Rupert. He steals every scene he is in. Willem Dafoe is great as his partner Alan Ward. Agent Anderson(Hackman) handles things in an unconventional manner while Agent Ward(Dafoe) is by the book. This is where Dafoe showed his true potential before he started screwing up his career by appearing in sewage like Speed 2, Boondock Saints, Body Of Evidence and XXX: State Of The Union. Also great in this movie is Brad Dourif  as the racist Deputy Clinton Pell and R. Lee Ermey as the racist mayor. I also like how they showed the views of the average ignorant Mississippian and how the cops either participated in the killing and terrorizing of Blacks in Mississippi or sat back and watched it happen.Conclusion: Mississippi Burning is the best movie of 1989 hands down and is definitely required viewing. But be forewarned that this is not an easy movie to watch. But if you can stomach the violence you have a gem on your hands.

There are still people who think they're above the law, which is far from the truth. The KKK maybe no longer be as big an issue, but the Westboro Baptist Church has essentially replaced them! They hide behind the Bible, their version of God, and worst of all, they have the law siding with them, most of the time. Why? Because of freedom of speech! They don't care who they're hurting, and they think no one can touch them, but apparently, that has been challenged, because they have been attacked, along with their children, but they still won't shut up! Some say, love your enemies, it's the Christian way to be. But with people like this, I find that difficult, if not impossible! Same thing with eye for an eye, and turn the other cheek.

Although it's a well-written production, it glosses over the ""old boy"" network of FBI field agents with local law enforcement.  There was no independent Mississippi regional FBI office when the investigation started, fieldwork being divided between New Orleans and Memphis (the latter taking the lead, and notorious for agents with a ""southern POV."") J. Edgar Hoover had to personally intervene to get the ball rolling, as part of his running political battle with the Kennedys as much as a search for justice.The families of the victims also raised objections to the brutal portrayal of the FBI investigation in this film, as counter to the non-violent humanism of the three murdered COFO activists.  And in truth, it was less of the ham-fisted theatrics Hackman shows here than old-fashioned bribery of a local informant for 30K that broke the case.  That said, let me play devil's advocate on one point.The Mississippi White Knights of the KKK operated with such impunity because of their complicity with local law enforcement and the ""2nd Amendment mentality.""  But since the 2nd Amendment applies to all citizens, what would have been the response if Mississippi blacks had also stood on *those* civil rights, to defend themselves against state tyrants like Sheriff Lawrence Rainey?  If NRA-free market purchase to bear arms had led to the stockpiling and then ""defensive use"" of them in Mississippi black communities; and Rainey and the White Knights then discovered they, too, could bleed?  This would have been a sure way to instigate Federal intervention in Mississippi without the prolonged procedural delay of investigation and (inconclusive) trial.

Along come two very different Federal agents (Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe) charged with finding out what has happened. They quickly rub the locals up the wrong way so Dafoe decides to bring in reinforcements. Lots and lots of reinforcements. Soon things start to get very nasty indeed.This is an Alan Parker movie so it's all a bit over the top and excessively melodramatic. Perhaps too, if one is feeling unkind, a bit moralistically full of itself: of course that's somewhat inevitable given the subject matter but Parker does rather succumb to the temptation to lay it on with a trowel. But there are good reasons not to feel too unkind as there's much here to be impressed by. It's one of the best southern based movies with civil rights themes of recent-ish years, better than `Ghosts of Mississippi' and miles better than `A Time to Kill' if maybe not quite in the same league as the wonderful `In the Heat of the Night'. An extremely effective score and some first class cinematography help it along no end. But what stands out is the acting: Brad Dourif, Michael Rooker and Gailard Sartain splendidly horrid as the racist baddies, Dafoe a welcome oasis of relative subtlety and restraint as Agent Ward.

250234,A17639YIJLDS1G,6301334345,still searching,"[1, 1]","Watching this brilliant film always puts me in mind, oddly one might at first think, of a song from Rodgers and Hammerstein's 1949 South Pacific, particularly when Willem Defoe's character, agent Alan Ward, asks the question of Gene Hackman's, agent Rupert Anderson; ""where does all this hate come from?"" If agent Ward had been a fan of Hollywood musicals he'd have already known that the answer is neatly encapsulated in Oscar Hammerstein's lyric for the song `You've got to be taught':You've got to be taughtTo hate and fear,You've got to be taughtFrom year to year,It's got to be drummedIn your dear little earYou've got to be carefully taught.You've got to be taught to be afraidOf people whose eyes are oddly made,And people whose skin is a diff'rent shade,You've got to be carefully taught.You've got to be taught before it's too late,Before you are six or seven or eight,To hate all the people your relatives hate,You've got to be carefully taught!The movie brilliantly evokes the atmosphere of hate and fear that must have been palpable in those early years of the sixties, precipitated by a clash of cultures and a dread of the unknown future that many would have readily killed to avoid. The characters of Ward and Anderson, whilst given light and shade through the performances of the two leads, almost too neatly embody the values and aspirations of those two cultures: the former, young, liberal, idealistic and rule book bound; the latter, middle-aged, conservative, cynical and willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done: that being to bring the arrogant, snearing killers of three young civil rights activists to justice. However, all of the acting performances are uniformally excellent but there are parts in the film where real life members of the local community are interviewed - and these are truly chilling.Mississippi Burning has been criticized for romanticizing the FBI's role in the investigation and, to some extent, rewriting history. Both criticisms would be justified if this was simply a documentary. It isn't social commentary, it's fiction based on fact. It's an entertainment; a product of the film industry designed to make a profit. Whatever the criticisms it is a brilliantly realized evocation of a dark part of human history that epitomizes all that is mean-spirited, evil and base in human beings and lies at the beginnings of journeys that end in Belsen, Dachau and Srebrinica.

250235,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,6301334345,Tim Janson,"[4, 5]","Based loosely on actual events, Mississippi tells the story of three civil rights workers, one black and two white who disappear in Jessup County, Mississippi.  The FBI sends in agents to investigate the disappearances, headed by Willem Dafoe as the young, by-the-book and a bit naive Agent Boyd.  He is joined by Gene Hackman as Agent Anderson.  Anderson himself was a former, small-town Mississippi sheriff and so has a greater understanding of the town and its people.Anderson and Boyd bump heads at nearly every turn of their investigation.  Boyd tries unsuccessfully to question the town's black residents but they are all unwilling to talk and with good reason...They are regularly beaten, and have their homes torched by the resident KKK members and include members of the local Law Enforcement including Deputy Pell (Brad Dourif) and Sheriff Stuckey, and other townfold including local businessmen.  R. Lee Ermey, in one of his earliest roles plays Mayor Tilman who is incensed at the investigation of his law enforecement officers.  Eventually, when Boyd fails to make any progress in the investigation, he allows Anderson to bring in his own people and use his own, less than legal methods to question the suspects which are not limited to threats and physical abuse.Mississippi Burning is a powerful tale of a sad time in America and this movie shows the true ugly underbelly of the deep south in the early 1960's.  But it would have been nice if all the residents were not treated as stupid redneck racists.  About the only white resident who seems to have any sympathy for the black people is Deputy Pell's wife played magnificently by Frances McDormad.  She gives a wonderful performance as a southern wife trapped in a situation that she cannot escape from.Also, it would have been nice to see some of the black actors given a role with a little more punch.  They all play submissive, frightened roles and one even states that perhaps if they leave the (white folk) alone they will leave them alone.  Virtually the only strong performance from a black actor comes from the Darius McCrary (Who would later play in the sitcom ""Family Matters).  Only this boy seems to have the courage to speak out and to the FBI.All that aside, Hackman and Dafoe really shine in their roles and playoff each other well.  Director Alan Parker builds the tention throughout and slowly starts the cracks that will eventually bring down those responsible for killing the three young men.
