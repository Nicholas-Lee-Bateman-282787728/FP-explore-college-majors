When Nureyev defected to the West, touching down in Paris, he was an immediate sensation. He was renowned in Russia, dancing with the Kirov, but he had not yet begun to dance, and he was already a celebrity. As a youth from the Urals in Siberia, he was muscular, an image of strength... tragically, in his final decade, he wasted away from AIDS. This documentary shows how Nureyev tried to keep up with his regular work schedule, run the Paris Ballet, star in a stage production ofThe King and I (50th Anniversary Edition), while the disease ravaged him. We see his apartment, filled with muscular male nudes, and visit a bathhouse where he was simply a man, not a celebrity.""Dancing through Darkness"" interviews Nureyev's collaborators&friends.; Sadly, there is no mention of his longtime partner Erik Bruhn, who also died from AIDS, nor an interview with his most harmonious collaborator, Dame Margot Fonteyn. Nureyev's style brought strength to the ballet. He revolutionized it. ""Dancing through the Darkness"" is a tragic chronicle of the accomplished danseur, who passed away too young. The world of ballet lost a genius.",4,The Lower Depths,1335830400,"05 1, 2012",2012,1206,"['Nureyev', 'Dancing', 'Darkness', 'documents', 'Russian', 'danseur', 'final', 'years', 'When', 'Nureyev', 'defected', 'West', 'touching', 'down', 'Paris', 'was', 'immediate', 'sensation', 'was', 'renowned', 'Russia', 'dancing', 'Kirov', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'begun', 'dance', 'was', 'already', 'celebrity', 'youth', 'Urals', 'Siberia', 'was', 'muscular', 'image', 'strength', 'tragically', 'final', 'decade', 'wasted', 'away', 'AIDS', 'documentary', 'how', 'Nureyev', 'tried', 'keep', 'up', 'regular', 'work', 'schedule', 'run', 'Paris', 'Ballet', 'star', 'stage', 'production', 'King', '50th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'disease', 'ravaged', 'see', 'apartment', 'filled', 'muscular', 'male', 'nudes', 'visit', 'bathhouse', 'where', 'was', 'simply', 'man', 'not', 'celebrity', 'Dancing', 'Darkness', 'Nureyev', 'collaborators', 'friends', 'Sadly', 'mention', 'longtime', 'partner', 'Erik', 'Bruhn', 'who', 'also', 'died', 'AIDS', 'interview', 'most', 'harmonious', 'collaborator', 'Dame', 'Margot', 'Fonteyn', 'Nureyev', 'style', 'brought', 'strength', 'ballet', 'revolutionized', 'Dancing', 'Darkness', 'tragic', 'chronicle', 'accomplished', 'danseur', 'who', 'passed', 'away', 'too', 'young', 'world', 'ballet', 'lost', 'genius']",N/A
23603,A1ORZKYPMHLRUC,0769720277,Jancal,"[0, 0]","The great, incomparable premier danseur Rudolf Nureyev never built up close friendships or relationships in his too-short lifetime.  This trait was evident in this 50 minute story of the last 10 years of his life, spent living in a modest apartment in Paris, France, which he had chosen originally when offered a creative position with the Paris Opera Ballet, which he helped shape into a fine ballet company.  When he became extremely ill in the last year (1991-1992) and could no longer teach, the company dropped him, and after a brief stay in the Caribbean he chose to return to Paris to face the end.  He bravely assist-choreographed in one final company production, ""La Bayadere,"" which had been one of his own youthful successes, and for which he appeared onstage afterward (being helped to stand by several dancers) to a thunderous standing ovation and receipt of a medal from France, the joy on his face apparent.  This disc is a lovingly put together tribute to the once phenomenal talent that was Rudolf Nureyev, and those of us who were fans get a close personal look at this determined, proud, brave man - from his early days leaving his family and country behind, forging a new career out of nothing but unsurpassed talent, a stranger in many strange lands as he traveled the world from company to company, his erratic personal life which brought him no lasting relationships, and his brave refusal to give in to the ravages of AIDS which he fought stoically to the end.

How do creative minds deal with the fact that their bodies are deteriorating?  How do artists handle a public that may want to know about their health more than their work?  Does an incurable illness spur creativity or hamper it?  These are all questions that have not been answered enough.When Newsweek had a cover story on AIDS and the arts, they showed Nureyev on the cover.  They barely touched the gay issue and stated that Nureyev never spoke out much about his illness.  Either in the article or in comments to the editor, a close confidante said that Nureyev feared that someone would sue him for infecting them, as Rock Hudson's ex-lover did.  However, here, those who know Nureyev speak openly about his gay identity and HIV status.  The owner of the bathhouse he frequented even participated in an interview.This documentary features men and women equally talking about the Nureyev they knew.  Discrimination against the HIV-positive is only hinted at here.  But one does get to see many people, of all genders and sexualities, supporting Nureyev and not giving a care about his illness, even though he died during tense years of prejudice against PWAs.  This work show people talking about Nureyev and barely shows any clips of the dancer speaking for himself; this may disappoint his hardcore fans.I wish this film had put Nureyev in context more.  Like Martina Navratolova (sp?), he is an Eastern European who defected.  Did many gays and lesbians do this or only the famous one?  Were other HIV-positive ballet dancers treated well like Nureyev or did his celebrity make him an exception?  This film show Nureyev gaunt, but unlike footage in ""Black Is/Black Ain't"" where one sees Bill T. Jones' lover Arnie dancing and coughing, you never see Nureyev physically struggling here.Unlike most documentaries, this one actually had foreign language subtitles.  This was helpful at times because many of the interviewees had poor English skills.  This work is not subtitled in Russian, Nureyev's mother tongue.  Because more and more Russians are moving to the United States, that would have been helpful to those viewers and I wish the DVD makers had thought about that.",4,an artist and AIDS,1113523200,"04 15, 2005",2005,2247,"['subjects', 'artists', 'AIDS', 'never', 'been', 'discussed', 'enough', 'How', 'do', 'creative', 'minds', 'deal', 'fact', 'bodies', 'are', 'deteriorating', 'How', 'do', 'artists', 'handle', 'public', 'may', 'want', 'know', 'health', 'more', 'work', 'incurable', 'illness', 'spur', 'creativity', 'hamper', 'are', 'questions', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'answered', 'enough.When', 'Newsweek', 'had', 'cover', 'story', 'AIDS', 'arts', 'showed', 'Nureyev', 'cover', 'barely', 'touched', 'gay', 'issue', 'stated', 'Nureyev', 'never', 'spoke', 'out', 'much', 'illness', 'article', 'comments', 'editor', 'close', 'confidante', 'said', 'Nureyev', 'feared', 'someone', 'would', 'sue', 'infecting', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'ex-lover', 'did', 'However', 'here', 'who', 'know', 'Nureyev', 'speak', 'openly', 'gay', 'identity', 'HIV', 'status', 'owner', 'bathhouse', 'frequented', 'even', 'participated', 'interview.This', 'documentary', 'features', 'men', 'women', 'equally', 'talking', 'Nureyev', 'knew', 'Discrimination', 'HIV-positive', 'only', 'hinted', 'here', 'one', 'get', 'see', 'many', 'people', 'genders', 'sexualities', 'supporting', 'Nureyev', 'not', 'giving', 'care', 'illness', 'even', 'died', 'tense', 'years', 'prejudice', 'PWAs', 'work', 'show', 'people', 'talking', 'Nureyev', 'barely', 'clips', 'dancer', 'speaking', 'may', 'disappoint', 'hardcore', 'fans.I', 'wish', 'film', 'had', 'put', 'Nureyev', 'context', 'more', 'Martina', 'Navratolova', 'sp', 'Eastern', 'European', 'who', 'defected', 'Did', 'many', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'do', 'only', 'famous', 'one', 'Were', 'other', 'HIV-positive', 'ballet', 'dancers', 'treated', 'well', 'Nureyev', 'did', 'celebrity', 'make', 'exception', 'film', 'show', 'Nureyev', 'gaunt', 'footage', 'Black', 'Is/Black', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'where', 'one', 'Bill', 'T.', 'Jones', 'lover', 'Arnie', 'dancing', 'coughing', 'never', 'see', 'Nureyev', 'physically', 'struggling', 'most', 'documentaries', 'one', 'actually', 'had', 'foreign', 'language', 'subtitles', 'was', 'helpful', 'times', 'because', 'many', 'interviewees', 'had', 'poor', 'English', 'skills', 'work', 'not', 'subtitled', 'Russian', 'Nureyev', 'mother', 'tongue', 'more', 'more', 'Russians', 'are', 'moving', 'United', 'States', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'helpful', 'viewers', 'wish', 'DVD', 'makers', 'had', 'thought']",N/A

It's amazing to me that nobody was able to interest Nureyev in sitting down for multiple interviews to build a video of substance about his life and his influence on 20th Century dance.  This film is a little annoying to look at because they often obscure a clear view of the man with fuzz and keyhole techniques, so you don't get to see him teaching or demonstrating to the dancers at Paris Opera Ballet.  What a missed opportunity.  Maybe there are some archives as yet untapped, I certainly hope so.  I would have loved to see the right person engage this guy's interest for an extended conversation.  He was so smart, so witty, and had such good insights, yet almost none of that is evident in any of the three main biographical videos.
