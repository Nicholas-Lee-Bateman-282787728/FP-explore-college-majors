Apparently, the producers thought Bob Dylan was the only musical influence of that time...not to mention hearing him constantly throughout the movie was beyond annoying. On TV this was four hours long (with commercials) but it just seemed to skim the surface of everything.

462967,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,6305408998,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[0, 6]","I finally bought this movie, impressed by it's sequel The 70's. Instead, I was unimpressed with the script which seemed too one dimensional for the times and the quality of NBC's work.The story chronicles the growth of an All-American family, the Herlihy's, and the unconnected condition of a young African American man named Emmett Taylor, and his struggle to both find himself and secure equal rights. Unlike it's predecessor, there is nothing to tie all of the four characters together and the story is comparatively weaker. The Wonder Years probably did cover this better.Another criticism of the movie involves the use of subheadings to tell the audience at what date they are going to be examining in depth for 30 minutes. They are a constant presence throughout the movie and actually detract at times because the appearance encourages viewers to take their attention off of the movie.  This overuse assumes there actually is nobody who knows the basic biggie events of the 60's either through personal experience or second hand knowledge.This is not to say it is completely bereft of merit. Indeed, the anti-war and racial justice movements are appropriately recognized as the source of great conscience and morals in a time when youth were actually presumed to have less sense than their parents. Yet, the young people in the story line demonstrate tremendous courage and possibility.As a feminist, I liked how the film hinted at Sarah's Weinstock's (Jordanna Brewster) emerging feminist consciousness from continuous subordination in the `liberated' New Left movement, but was disappointed that it did not show the emerging women's liberation movement (including the movement for liberalized contraception and legalized abortion)-since it did begin in the late 1960's. Although Sarah is as smart as any of her male colleagues, some of them did not wish to consider women as equal partners in social progress. While I believe part of the reason this character did not receive the same detail was her supporting status, it would have made for interesting plot development.Yes, Katie Herhliy's journey involved the double standard, a medical community pre-women's health movement, sexual exploitation and another click regarding female gender roles in the counterculture, but her character was a main character and she was given less time and script development compared to the men. Essentially, it seems as if she was invisible for most of the film.Overall however, I would recommend this movie only if people are interested in a conventional telling of the 1960's-complete with the omission of women's issues and gender specific concerns. People interested in a more rounded dramatization will not be happy.",3,Needed a more rounded script,1009497600,"12 28, 2001",2001,2716,"['finally', 'bought', 'movie', 'impressed', '70', 'Instead', 'was', 'unimpressed', 'script', 'seemed', 'too', 'one', 'dimensional', 'times', 'quality', 'NBC', 'work.The', 'story', 'growth', 'All-American', 'family', 'Herlihy', 'unconnected', 'condition', 'young', 'African', 'American', 'man', 'named', 'Emmett', 'Taylor', 'struggle', 'find', 'secure', 'equal', 'rights', 'predecessor', 'nothing', 'tie', 'four', 'characters', 'together', 'story', 'comparatively', 'weaker', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'probably', 'did', 'cover', 'better.Another', 'criticism', 'movie', 'use', 'subheadings', 'tell', 'audience', 'what', 'date', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'examining', 'depth', '30', 'minutes', 'are', 'constant', 'presence', 'movie', 'actually', 'detract', 'times', 'appearance', 'viewers', 'take', 'attention', 'movie', 'overuse', 'actually', 'nobody', 'who', 'basic', 'biggie', 'events', '60', 'personal', 'experience', 'second', 'hand', 'knowledge.This', 'not', 'say', 'completely', 'bereft', 'merit', 'Indeed', 'anti-war', 'racial', 'justice', 'movements', 'are', 'appropriately', 'recognized', 'source', 'great', 'conscience', 'morals', 'time', 'when', 'youth', 'were', 'actually', 'presumed', 'have', 'less', 'sense', 'parents', 'young', 'people', 'story', 'line', 'demonstrate', 'tremendous', 'courage', 'possibility.As', 'feminist', 'liked', 'how', 'film', 'hinted', 'Sarah', 'Weinstock', 'Jordanna', 'Brewster', 'emerging', 'feminist', 'consciousness', 'continuous', 'subordination', 'liberated', 'New', 'Left', 'movement', 'was', 'disappointed', 'did', 'not', 'show', 'emerging', 'women', 'liberation', 'movement', 'including', 'movement', 'liberalized', 'contraception', 'legalized', 'abortion', '-since', 'did', 'begin', 'late', '1960', 'Sarah', 'as', 'smart', 'male', 'colleagues', 'did', 'not', 'wish', 'consider', 'women', 'equal', 'partners', 'social', 'progress', 'believe', 'part', 'reason', 'character', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'same', 'detail', 'was', 'supporting', 'status', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'interesting', 'plot', 'development.Yes', 'Katie', 'Herhliy', 'journey', 'involved', 'double', 'standard', 'medical', 'community', 'pre-women', 'health', 'movement', 'sexual', 'exploitation', 'click', 'regarding', 'female', 'gender', 'roles', 'counterculture', 'character', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'given', 'less', 'time', 'script', 'development', 'compared', 'men', 'Essentially', 'was', 'invisible', 'most', 'film.Overall', 'however', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'only', 'people', 'are', 'interested', 'conventional', 'telling', ""1960's-complete"", 'omission', 'women', 'issues', 'gender', 'specific', 'concerns', 'People', 'interested', 'more', 'rounded', 'dramatization', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'happy']",The '60s

The greatest thing to come out of that generation, and nothing mentioned.I have to say this movie was good eye candy, with passable acting, but the stereotypes were unbelievable.  My parents were of this generation (I was born in 73), and they were not radicals, didn't do drugs, didn't drop out, didn't go to Woodstock (you'd think the entire country was there from all the talk) and didn't walk around quoting Bob Dylan (dear Lord, I wanted to smack the next person who did that in this movie!) They were just normal, hard working Americans trying to get by in a fairly normal midwestern suburban town.  Of course, to make a movie you have to get more excitement than that, but not at the expense of stereotyping a whole generation.I found Julia Stiles character to be the most real and human (not to mention I think she was the one decent actor in the movie); the Michael character I just found utterly annoying (the acting school of about 3 dramatic poses, 1. let's look shocked! 2. let's look sad! 3. let's look stoic!and they all looked the same to me); the freaked out Veteran brother was decent, if utterly stereotyped.I thought it was a decent historical document, but you can watch documentaries for that.Then again, it could just be my own personal opinion is a bit skewed, being of that 'Generation X' group that seems to be so despised by the 60's generation.
