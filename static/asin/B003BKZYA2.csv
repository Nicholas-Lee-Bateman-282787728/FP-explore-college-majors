I've never heard of the actors here, but they do a good job, especially the Garland character. But the soundtrack is the best thing about the movie. It mixes country honky-tonk and jazz very well. I also liked the sets, all dressed in 50s perfection and lit with a beautiful glow. Some have pointed out the many factual errors here, but this is far from a documentary. As these genre films go, this Nashville tragedy film is one of the better ones I've seen.

1335852,A18UIRJY3LJY0S,B003BKZYA2,David Purcell,"[10, 11]","I really thought that I'd enjoy this movie but each minute, each scene just kept displaying historical inaccuracies which were completely pointless historical inaccuracies that eventually just wore me down and killed the movie for me. In other words, they could have gotten these dates and characters and events right without harming the movie's drama in any way.  For example, the real opening scene of Hank at the Opry-Hank Williams wasn't on the Opry in 1945 and his song that was used wasn't written yet. To mention a few more stupidities - Billy Byrd wasn't a hopeless drunk.  The Korean War wasn't still going on in 1955.  Just to mention a few. . .The other scenes of Hank establishing himself in Nashville are interesting and the name dropping and glimpses of the stars are enjoyable.The real problem with the movie is the incredibly bad writing and directing which the fine acting of this cast, all of whom were unfamiliar to me, could not overcome.  Doesn't it really say it all that all of the confusion  and murkiness and incomprehensible motivation of some of the characters, particularly Evelyn after Hank's accident, is understandable only after watching the deleted scenes.  It's certainly suggested that Evelyn set up, in Mafia like fashion, Hank's accident but the deleted scene shows her and her boyfriend the record producer sending Hank to the asylum.  I really didn't think that all of the previous cliches of the long suffering, ignored, and lonely wife alone were quite enough to justify attempting to have him killed and failing that, shipped off to an asylum.  This particular deleted scene would have made the film's ending a bit clearer.  Not really though-at the films end did you know whether Hank knew what Evelyn had done to him and did he still love or hate her?  Was he ambivalent or undecided?As anyone who's checked knows, Hank wasn't run off the road.  He thought that a tire was shot out.  And after the accident he was in a coma so he really couldn't converse with his loving spouse.  However, with so many other things wrong with this movie, I won't criticize those things as the actual events would be less dramatic and more difficult to convey.On the bright side I thought that the movie looked really good and captured the feel of the era very well.One last question-Does anyone have a clue as to who that guy was and why he was getting kicked and stomped at the Opry or was that just included for color?  I kept waiting for a reference or mention because this peripheral beating seemed bizarre and altogether pointless.  Maybe I missed it.  Perhaps I was still in shock at seeing Hank Williams on the Opry in 1945.",2,Dumb Even for a Fake Biopic.,1305331200,"05 14, 2011",2011,2658,"['really', 'thought', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'minute', 'scene', 'just', 'kept', 'displaying', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'were', 'completely', 'pointless', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'eventually', 'just', 'wore', 'down', 'killed', 'movie', 'other', 'words', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'dates', 'characters', 'events', 'right', 'harming', 'movie', 'drama', 'way', 'example', 'real', 'opening', 'scene', 'Hank', 'Opry-Hank', 'Williams', 'was', ""n't"", 'Opry', '1945', 'song', 'was', 'used', 'was', ""n't"", 'written', 'yet', 'mention', 'few', 'more', 'stupidities', 'Billy', 'Byrd', 'was', ""n't"", 'hopeless', 'drunk', 'Korean', 'War', 'was', ""n't"", 'still', 'going', '1955', 'Just', 'mention', 'few', '.The', 'other', 'scenes', 'Hank', 'establishing', 'Nashville', 'are', 'interesting', 'name', 'dropping', 'glimpses', 'stars', 'are', 'enjoyable.The', 'real', 'problem', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'bad', 'writing', 'directing', 'fine', 'acting', 'cast', 'whom', 'were', 'unfamiliar', 'could', 'not', 'overcome', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'confusion', 'murkiness', 'incomprehensible', 'motivation', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Evelyn', 'Hank', 'accident', 'understandable', 'only', 'watching', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'certainly', 'suggested', 'Evelyn', 'set', 'up', 'Mafia', 'fashion', 'Hank', 'accident', 'deleted', 'scene', 'boyfriend', 'record', 'producer', 'sending', 'Hank', 'asylum', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'previous', 'cliches', 'long', 'suffering', 'ignored', 'lonely', 'wife', 'alone', 'were', 'quite', 'enough', 'justify', 'attempting', 'have', 'killed', 'failing', 'shipped', 'off', 'asylum', 'particular', 'deleted', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'ending', 'bit', 'clearer', 'Not', 'really', 'though-at', 'films', 'end', 'did', 'know', 'Hank', 'knew', 'what', 'Evelyn', 'had', 'done', 'did', 'still', 'love', 'hate', 'Was', 'ambivalent', 'undecided', 'anyone', 'who', 'checked', 'knows', 'Hank', 'was', ""n't"", 'run', 'off', 'road', 'thought', 'tire', 'was', 'shot', 'out', 'accident', 'was', 'coma', 'so', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'converse', 'loving', 'spouse', 'However', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'wrong', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'criticize', 'things', 'actual', 'events', 'would', 'be', 'less', 'dramatic', 'more', 'difficult', 'convey.On', 'bright', 'side', 'thought', 'movie', 'looked', 'really', 'good', 'captured', 'feel', 'era', 'very', 'well.One', 'last', 'question-Does', 'anyone', 'have', 'clue', 'who', 'guy', 'was', 'why', 'was', 'getting', 'kicked', 'stomped', 'Opry', 'was', 'just', 'included', 'color', 'kept', 'waiting', 'reference', 'mention', 'peripheral', 'beating', 'seemed', 'bizarre', 'altogether', 'pointless', 'Maybe', 'missed', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'still', 'shock', 'seeing', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'Opry', '1945']",N/A

1335854,A2JBVRCJ8VS7PQ,B003BKZYA2,Jerry (Celil) Parker,"[0, 0]","This film of the &#34;biopic&#34; genre, &#34;Crazy: the Hank Garland Story&#34; (Alliance/Screen Media 114586 being the DVD edition viewed) pleases greatly, despite all of the historical and biographical inaccuracies that abound in it regarding the real Hank Garland, famous guitar recording session and back-up musician who also had some chances to play and to record as a soloist in country music and even in jazz. There are numerous errors regarding his real life, and his real career. Some of the Amazon-U.S. reviews go into detail about those matters, so there is no need for to belabour such issues here.Such levels of inaccuracy are common fare in films about musicians and this one, more or less about Hank Garland, is no worse than like films are in that respect. But, on the other hand, this movie, regarding how it stacks up with other country music biopics, is refreshingly free of the kind of, and level of, sentimental and lachrymose qualities or excess of dross that can make one squirm when watching all too many other motion pictures about such singers, songwriters, and instrumentalists. That is no small plus for a film in this genre.The level of music-making is so high that it makes the film a joy to HEAR as well as to watch. Garland's own recordings were not used; the players and singers who recreate Garland's music are mostly very fine in their own right. No doubt, a soundtrack recording of the film would make worthwhile many nights at the roundtable (well, now nights with the lasers, for CDs, since this 2007 film probably had no music release on LP!), playing it over and over again. The vintage photos in the end credits provide their own kind of worthwhile b&w; viewing. Be sure to catch the deleted scenes; they put certain moments in the film into more understandable light.So, there you are: an entertaining movie, one gratefully free of emotional excess, that is a warm and affectionate tribute to a great player, with some fine guitar-picking and good singing to hear and to see. There surely is a lot worse fare than this film provides.",4,"Well Made and Enjoyable Musical Biopic, in Spite of All Its the Biographical and Other Inaccuracies",1401926400,"06 5, 2014",2014,2076,"['film', '34', 'biopic', '34', 'genre', '34', 'Crazy', 'Hank', 'Garland', 'Story', '34', 'Alliance/Screen', 'Media', '114586', 'being', 'DVD', 'edition', 'viewed', 'greatly', 'historical', 'biographical', 'inaccuracies', 'abound', 'regarding', 'real', 'Hank', 'Garland', 'famous', 'guitar', 'recording', 'session', 'back-up', 'musician', 'who', 'also', 'had', 'chances', 'play', 'record', 'soloist', 'country', 'music', 'even', 'jazz', 'are', 'numerous', 'errors', 'regarding', 'real', 'life', 'real', 'career', 'Amazon-U.S.', 'reviews', 'go', 'detail', 'matters', 'need', 'belabour', 'such', 'issues', 'here.Such', 'levels', 'inaccuracy', 'are', 'common', 'fare', 'films', 'musicians', 'one', 'more', 'less', 'Hank', 'Garland', 'worse', 'films', 'are', 'respect', 'other', 'hand', 'movie', 'regarding', 'how', 'up', 'other', 'country', 'music', 'biopics', 'refreshingly', 'free', 'kind', 'level', 'sentimental', 'lachrymose', 'qualities', 'excess', 'dross', 'can', 'make', 'one', 'squirm', 'when', 'watching', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'motion', 'pictures', 'such', 'singers', 'songwriters', 'instrumentalists', 'small', 'plus', 'film', 'genre.The', 'level', 'music-making', 'so', 'high', 'film', 'joy', 'HEAR', 'as', 'well', 'watch', 'Garland', 'own', 'recordings', 'were', 'not', 'used', 'players', 'singers', 'who', 'recreate', 'Garland', 'music', 'are', 'mostly', 'very', 'fine', 'own', 'right', 'doubt', 'soundtrack', 'recording', 'film', 'would', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'many', 'nights', 'roundtable', 'well', 'now', 'lasers', 'CDs', '2007', 'film', 'probably', 'had', 'music', 'release', 'LP', 'playing', 'over', 'again', 'vintage', 'photos', 'end', 'credits', 'provide', 'own', 'kind', 'worthwhile', 'b', 'w', 'viewing', 'Be', 'sure', 'catch', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'put', 'certain', 'moments', 'film', 'more', 'understandable', 'light.So', 'are', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'one', 'gratefully', 'free', 'emotional', 'excess', 'warm', 'affectionate', 'tribute', 'great', 'player', 'fine', 'guitar-picking', 'good', 'singing', 'hear', 'see', 'surely', 'lot', 'worse', 'fare', 'film']",N/A

Some complain that this biopic is not ""accurate"". Well, I dunno if it intends to be so regarding the intimate details of his personal life, but then, whose personal life could ever really be portrayed accurately? What is undeniably accurate is that Hank was a terrific, versatile guitarist. This aspect of the movie is extremely well done. And, accurate or not, the dramatization of his life is very well done.
