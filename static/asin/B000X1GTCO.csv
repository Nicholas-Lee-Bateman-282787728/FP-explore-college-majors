1112852,A2C2FX8EIH1XV0,B000X1GTCO,BAM,"[11, 11]","Shawn Trautman's Dance Sampler is a GREAT place to start!His website has a breakdown of each move that is taught for each dance on this video. To find the list, go to his website, [...]  Locate this DVD and then click on ""What dances and moves are taught in Dance Lessons 101?""He covers a lot of territory on this DVD!This DVD starts with the ""rules of engagement,"" how to hold on to your partner, where to stand, which foot to start on and then progresses through the different dances from the easiest to the more difficult.While ladies are always right and guys get what's left, the guys get to lead.  They should take advantage of it!  Shawn explains the WHAT and HOW of being a good lead. Ladies, we don't get to be our partners ""coach"" on the dance floor.  This too is a learning process.There is no need to master all the dances or moves on this DVD before you go dancing.  If you want to learn ""something"" in a hurry, start with slow dance and if you have time, add the waltz. The skip feature on your DVD player will be your friend as you review each lesson. Add additional dances when you are ready to move on.Shawn has done a great job of ""condensing"" each dance lesson that is taught on this DVD.  If the same lesson for each dance were taught in a ballroom setting, it would probably encompass at least a one hour lesson--possibly more than one lesson--just to get the basics.So, don't be discouraged if you have not mastered all the dances in 124 minutes!  Unless you have a dance background, each dance will need to be reviewed over and over again and practiced.If you only want to learn the basics of each of the dances--slow dance, waltz, two-step, swing, hustle, salsa, cha-cha, west coast swing--this DVD will be enough to satisfy that desire.  You will be able to go dancing anywhere with a decent repertoire so that you will look good and feel confident on the dance floor.After you have mastered the basics given in each lesson on this DVD, additional DVDs and DVD sets are available that will allow you to expand your horizons if you wish.  If you love Two-Step or West Coast swing for instance, Shawn offers three DVD sets for each of those dances that will take you from beginner to intermediate. The individual DVDs in the sets can be purchased seperately.This DVD can be used to replace ballroom dance class instruction or used as an enhancement for ballroom classes.  It may also serve as a refresher course if you haven't been dancing in awhile and want to ""brush up"" on your skills before a big date or a night dancing.We own this DVD and have purchased three to give as gifts this Christmas. In addition, we own two of Shawn's three DVD sets. We have purchased them from:  Amazon Marketplace Merchants, ebay and from Shawn's website. Ask about price matching.We have viewed a number of other dance videos.  I always find something to take away and use.  However, when selecting a DVD to buy and gift, it is hard to beat Shawn's teaching.  The inclusion of eight dances on this DVD makes it a winner.  If you can only afford one DVD and need it to cover a lot of territory, this is the one to buy.",5,No dance background?  You can do it!!!!

1112857,A2PTBLIHD9SPN9,B000X1GTCO,"John J. Kirschman ""jjkmusic""","[78, 81]","Ten and twenty years ago, my wife and I took a few months of weekly dancing lessons for around $600 each. After each lesson, I couldn't remember much of what we had learned in the previous lesson and my wife and I would disagree with our steps. Because each of the dance companies were preparing us to dance competitively, although we were there to learn to dance socially, my back was always hurting after each lesson from trying to conform my body to these exact positionings. My wife and I learned very little, and thus when we went out dancing we rarely used anything from our dance lessons but just danced like everyone else did, so we could have fun. When we saw others dancing ballroom style, they always danced the same basic moves counter-clockwise around the dance floor (i.e., forward, left turns, and lady turns), regardless of which dance they were performing.After 33 years of marriage and dancing in our own styles, I thought I'd try learning ballroom dancing for my wife again but decided to try something different. I bought 6 of Shawn's dancing DVD's and took them with us on our vacation, watching one dance lesson each day, taking my time analyzing them and making detailed notes of each move (my wife would watch them after I had studied them, as she could learn faster and remember better than I did). In each lesson, we learned more than several lessons with either of the dance companies I mentioned above. Then my wife and I took our time to slowly work on each dance together. We moved the chairs and table out of the kitchens and set up speakers that were hooked up to my computer to play music, and would dance for an hour each night to different songs. Just for fun, we even tried new moves that Shawn hadn't taught and probably doesn't exist. Learning to dance was enjoyable and dancing with my wife turned out to be a wonderful experience - I finally understood the joy of dancing with one I love. After three weeks traveling through the U.S. and dancing almost every day, my wife and I knew how to perform 10 different dances well. We next went on a cruise, where we danced these dances every night and received compliments that we appeared to have been dancing for years.Since our cruise, we were unable to dance for a few weeks, so I forgot many of our dance moves. Unlike taking lessons from the dance companies, we didn't have to pay to relearn the dances - I went back to my notes and went back to Shawn's lessons and were quickly able to relearn the dances.We have since purchased additional dance videos from Shawn and will purchase additional ones in a few months. He takes his time instructing us and gives various angles to his lessons. I'm sure you will see how great he and his wife do from the other reviewers, so there's no need to cover that here. I just want you to see the benefits of purchasing his DVD's over taking dance lessons from the dance companies (even if you want to compete, I suggest you learn the dance lessons from him first, as he was a dance teacher at one of those companies long ago according to his statements on his DVD's and in his book).Before you purchase a DVD of his, I recommend you purchase his book, which comes with a DVD of dance videos before purchasing your first DVD.",5,It's About Time I Really Learned How To Dance!!!,1253923200,"09 26, 2009",2009,3250,"['Ten', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'wife', 'took', 'few', 'months', 'weekly', 'dancing', 'lessons', '600', 'lesson', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'much', 'what', 'had', 'learned', 'previous', 'lesson', 'wife', 'would', 'disagree', 'steps', 'dance', 'companies', 'were', 'preparing', 'dance', 'competitively', 'were', 'there', 'learn', 'dance', 'socially', 'back', 'was', 'always', 'hurting', 'lesson', 'trying', 'conform', 'body', 'exact', 'positionings', 'wife', 'learned', 'very', 'little', 'thus', 'when', 'went', 'out', 'dancing', 'rarely', 'used', 'anything', 'dance', 'lessons', 'just', 'danced', 'everyone', 'else', 'did', 'could', 'have', 'fun', 'When', 'saw', 'others', 'dancing', 'ballroom', 'style', 'always', 'danced', 'same', 'basic', 'moves', 'counter-clockwise', 'dance', 'floor', 'i.e.', 'forward', 'left', 'lady', 'turns', 'regardless', 'dance', 'were', 'performing.After', '33', 'years', 'marriage', 'dancing', 'own', 'styles', 'thought', ""'d"", 'try', 'learning', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'wife', 'again', 'decided', 'try', 'something', 'different', 'bought', '6', 'Shawn', 'dancing', 'DVD', 'took', 'vacation', 'watching', 'one', 'dance', 'lesson', 'day', 'taking', 'time', 'analyzing', 'making', 'detailed', 'notes', 'move', 'wife', 'would', 'watch', 'had', 'studied', 'could', 'learn', 'faster', 'remember', 'better', 'did', 'lesson', 'learned', 'more', 'several', 'lessons', 'dance', 'companies', 'mentioned', 'above', 'Then', 'wife', 'took', 'time', 'slowly', 'work', 'dance', 'together', 'moved', 'chairs', 'table', 'kitchens', 'set', 'up', 'speakers', 'were', 'hooked', 'up', 'computer', 'play', 'music', 'would', 'dance', 'hour', 'night', 'different', 'songs', 'Just', 'fun', 'even', 'tried', 'new', 'moves', 'Shawn', 'had', ""n't"", 'taught', 'probably', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Learning', 'dance', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'dancing', 'wife', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'finally', 'understood', 'joy', 'dancing', 'one', 'love', 'three', 'weeks', 'traveling', 'U.S.', 'dancing', 'almost', 'day', 'wife', 'knew', 'how', 'perform', '10', 'different', 'dances', 'well', 'next', 'went', 'cruise', 'where', 'danced', 'dances', 'night', 'received', 'compliments', 'appeared', 'have', 'been', 'dancing', 'years.Since', 'cruise', 'were', 'unable', 'dance', 'few', 'weeks', 'forgot', 'many', 'dance', 'moves', 'taking', 'lessons', 'dance', 'companies', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'pay', 'relearn', 'dances', 'went', 'back', 'notes', 'went', 'back', 'Shawn', 'lessons', 'were', 'quickly', 'able', 'relearn', 'dances.We', 'have', 'purchased', 'additional', 'dance', 'videos', 'Shawn', 'will', 'purchase', 'additional', 'ones', 'few', 'months', 'time', 'instructing', 'various', 'angles', 'lessons', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'see', 'how', 'great', 'wife', 'do', 'other', 'reviewers', 'need', 'cover', 'here', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'benefits', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'over', 'taking', 'dance', 'lessons', 'dance', 'companies', 'even', 'want', 'compete', 'suggest', 'learn', 'dance', 'lessons', 'first', 'was', 'dance', 'teacher', 'one', 'companies', 'long', 'ago', 'according', 'statements', 'DVD', 'book', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'recommend', 'purchase', 'book', 'DVD', 'dance', 'videos', 'purchasing', 'first', 'DVD']",Dance Lessons 101: The Basics and Beyond
