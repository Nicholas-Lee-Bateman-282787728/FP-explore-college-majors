When I'm in the mood to see a car chase and some hand to hand combat this has always been an enjoyable ride.A great transfer to HD. I liked this movie a lot when it came out - which should make my disdain for the others in the series more palpable. The action is crisp and clean, fewer blurs than the standard definition. The care chases are that much more exciting.

737397,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00008AOVL,A Customer,"[0, 1]","Summary:Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is an ex U.S. special forces agent that has retired to Monaco and now works as a 'transporter' for hire - mostly doing illegal things like helping bank robbers get away and transporting kidnapped victims, etc.  He is very good at his job and demands that his clients follow his rules.Everything is fine until he breaks his own rule, rule #3: Never open the package.  He is hired to transport what turns out to be a young woman, Lai (Qi Shu).  When a chance mishap forces him to look at the package (she's in a big duffle bag) he makes several mistakes that reveals to his employer, Darren Bettencourt (Matt Schulze), that he opened the package.  Big mistake.  Bettencourt tries to blow him up but Frank happens to survive.  When he returns to Bettencourt's place to avenge the failed murder attempt, Bettencourt isn't there, but Lai somehow ends up in the car that he steals to get away.Lai then sets him up to help her.  Apparently Bettencourt and Lai's father, Mr. Kwai (Ric Young) are working together to transport immigrants into the country illegally.  Lai wants to stop it.  Frank doesn't want any part in it, until he sleeps with Lai and she lies to him that it is her family that is being transported.  Once he gets involved, Frank has to finish the job, and of course he ends up with Lai in the end.My Comments:I was expecting a much more superficial premise - like Frank looks in the bag and falls in love with Lai.  He didn't and that made the whole movie worth watching.  It didn't make it great, but it was much better than I had anticipated.  There were, of course, some problems with the movie, but there were also some good points.  Problems first...As is the case with most of these movies, all of the characters are very shallow.  Frank is the psychologically damaged good guy who has spent too much time in military training (think Rambo here).  Lai is the sweet, innocent girl who likes sleeping with any masculine guy.  Darren and Mr. Kwai are trademark bad guys.  The only person who is kind of surprising, though still rather stereotypical, is the inspector that helps Frank out, Tarconi (Franois Berl&eacute;and).  So, no depth to characters, but when you aren't really expecting any, it's forgivable.The other major problem (Lai sleeping with Frank on a whim was a problem too, but this is more important) was the sheer length of the movie.  Where some action films seem to short (The Bourne Identity) because they actually have a plot, this one went to long.  For some reason Frank doesn't want to kill anyone so he has to fight them all about fifteen times.  It also should have ended at the docks instead of continuing into the incredibly drawn out, Indiana Jones rip-off, diesel fight scene.  And the airplane skydive thing, that was just over-the-top.  So, the major problems are the shallow character (forgivable) and the drawn out 'story' (which is much less forgivable).So what were the positives?  I was surprised, as noted above, that Frank stuck to his principles as long as he did and didn't fall for Lai from the get go.  Also, I had no idea that Jason Statham is as good of a martial artist as he apparently was in this movie (assuming he actually did most of his fight sequences).  His fight sequence in Bettencourt's house was pretty remarkable.  Some of the others got a bit silly, but that first one was pretty cool.  Also, even though there were a few rather cheesy lines, the majority of the dialogue (there wasn't much, which is always a good decision in these kinds of films) was pretty good.  I think the reason why is because most of it was left up to Francois Berleand, whose French accent made his presentation seem suave in an action flick.Overall, the movie is pretty good for this genre (no brainer sex and action flick).  The fight scenes are occasionally original and for the most part well-choreographed and the lack of romance, which is what made it mostly convincing, was bearable.  Pretty good action flick with very few major names.  Perhaps Jason Statham will make a name for himself - the next Bruce Willis?",3,Pleasantly surprised,1056412800,"06 24, 2003",2003,4107,"['Summary', 'Frank', 'Martin', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'ex', 'U.S.', 'special', 'forces', 'agent', 'retired', 'Monaco', 'now', ""'transporter"", 'hire', 'mostly', 'doing', 'illegal', 'things', 'helping', 'bank', 'robbers', 'get', 'away', 'transporting', 'kidnapped', 'victims', 'etc', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'demands', 'clients', 'follow', 'rules.Everything', 'fine', 'own', 'rule', 'rule', '3', 'Never', 'open', 'package', 'hired', 'transport', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'young', 'woman', 'Lai', 'Qi', 'Shu', 'When', 'chance', 'mishap', 'look', 'package', 'big', 'duffle', 'bag', 'several', 'mistakes', 'reveals', 'employer', 'Darren', 'Bettencourt', 'Matt', 'Schulze', 'opened', 'package', 'Big', 'mistake', 'Bettencourt', 'blow', 'up', 'Frank', 'survive', 'When', 'Bettencourt', 'place', 'avenge', 'failed', 'murder', 'attempt', 'Bettencourt', ""n't"", 'there', 'Lai', 'somehow', 'up', 'car', 'get', 'away.Lai', 'then', 'up', 'help', 'Apparently', 'Bettencourt', 'Lai', 'father', 'Mr.', 'Kwai', 'Ric', 'Young', 'are', 'working', 'together', 'transport', 'immigrants', 'country', 'illegally', 'Lai', 'stop', 'Frank', ""n't"", 'want', 'part', 'Lai', 'family', 'being', 'transported', 'Once', 'involved', 'Frank', 'finish', 'job', 'course', 'up', 'Lai', 'end.My', 'Comments', 'was', 'expecting', 'much', 'more', 'superficial', 'premise', 'Frank', 'bag', 'love', 'Lai', 'did', ""n't"", 'made', 'whole', 'movie', 'watching', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'great', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'anticipated', 'were', 'course', 'problems', 'movie', 'were', 'also', 'good', 'points', 'Problems', 'first', 'As', 'case', 'most', 'movies', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'shallow', 'Frank', 'psychologically', 'damaged', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'military', 'training', 'think', 'Rambo', 'here', 'Lai', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'girl', 'who', 'sleeping', 'masculine', 'guy', 'Darren', 'Mr.', 'Kwai', 'are', 'trademark', 'bad', 'guys', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'kind', 'surprising', 'still', 'rather', 'stereotypical', 'inspector', 'Frank', 'out', 'Tarconi', 'Franois', 'Berl', 'eacute', 'So', 'depth', 'characters', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'expecting', 'forgivable.The', 'other', 'major', 'problem', 'Lai', 'sleeping', 'Frank', 'whim', 'was', 'problem', 'too', 'more', 'important', 'was', 'sheer', 'length', 'movie', 'Where', 'action', 'films', 'seem', 'short', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'actually', 'have', 'plot', 'one', 'went', 'long', 'reason', 'Frank', ""n't"", 'want', 'kill', 'anyone', 'so', 'fight', 'fifteen', 'times', 'also', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'docks', 'instead', 'continuing', 'incredibly', 'drawn', 'out', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'rip-off', 'diesel', 'fight', 'scene', 'airplane', 'skydive', 'thing', 'was', 'just', 'over-the-top', 'So', 'major', 'problems', 'are', 'shallow', 'character', 'forgivable', 'drawn', ""'story"", 'much', 'less', 'forgivable', '.So', 'were', 'positives', 'was', 'surprised', 'noted', 'Frank', 'stuck', 'principles', 'as', 'long', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'fall', 'Lai', 'get', 'go', 'Also', 'had', 'idea', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'as', 'good', 'martial', 'artist', 'apparently', 'was', 'movie', 'assuming', 'actually', 'did', 'most', 'fight', 'sequences', 'fight', 'sequence', 'Bettencourt', 'house', 'was', 'pretty', 'remarkable', 'others', 'got', 'bit', 'silly', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'Also', 'even', 'were', 'few', 'rather', 'cheesy', 'lines', 'majority', 'dialogue', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'always', 'good', 'decision', 'kinds', 'films', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'think', 'reason', 'why', 'most', 'was', 'left', 'up', 'Francois', 'Berleand', 'French', 'accent', 'made', 'presentation', 'seem', 'suave', 'action', 'flick.Overall', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'genre', 'brainer', 'sex', 'action', 'flick', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'occasionally', 'original', 'most', 'part', 'well-choreographed', 'lack', 'romance', 'what', 'made', 'mostly', 'convincing', 'was', 'bearable', 'Pretty', 'good', 'action', 'flick', 'very', 'few', 'major', 'names', 'Perhaps', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'will', 'make', 'name', 'next', 'Bruce', 'Willis']","Transporter, The"

737399,A1AUOVXPT5MYX4,B00008AOVL,"A. Hutchinson ""Boogie Down Bronx""","[0, 1]","The opening third of the flick is by far the best part. Frank Martin lives by his three rules: never alter the deal, no names, never open the package. Up until he breaks one of his rules the movie is an interesting look at a man who lives by his own terms in an extremely violent and dangerous portion of the world. Unfortunately after he finds the girl the movie breaks down into a series of cliches and explosions that are less interesting.I have liked Jason Statham a lot not just in those English gangster movies but in ""The One"" with Jet Li and John Carpenter's ""Ghosts of Mars,"" he deserves to be a star in his own right and this movie co-starring a vehicle should have been the right vehicle for him. It's a shame he was given so little to do, aside from kicking the crap out of many people, which he does quite handily. There's a lot of talk about ""rules"" in this movie and the movie itself obeys the rules of martial arts onscreen, one being that when the hero is facing a bunch of bad guys, they're only allowed to attack him one or two at a time, and they're not allowed to have guns unless they stand so close that the hero can disarm them. Jackie Chan's classic shtick of picking up any handy item to use as a weapon is alive and well here, likewise Chan's trademark element of farce/slapstick, e.g. the oil-slick brouhaha. And we have death-defying stunts galore and tire-squealing car chases and all sorts of goings -on. Yet somehow Mr. Statham himself seems to get lost in the proceedings.It's really not his fault. His character is very sketchily written, the plot seems to have been made up as they went along a la ""Casablanca,"" and the desired chemistry between him and the Chinese heroine just doesn't happen. I don't know who the actress is or what she did previously, and she's, you know, cute and all that, but she just did nothing for me whatsoever, and apparently not much for  Jason Statham either. She's no Bai Ling, let's say, much less a Lucy Liu or Kelly Hu or--dare I mention the name--Michelle Yeoh aka Michelle Kwan. She's a cypher and even the writers seem to have grasped that; look how long they keep her bound and gagged onscreen to try to generate some fetishistic interest in what's happening with her. ""The Big Hit,"" another movie with a kidnapped Chinese chick falling for the kidnapper, only took about five minutes to generate the romantic oomph that his one never really achieves. The movie doesn't even bother including the usually obligatory closing shot of  the hero & heroine alone together, as though acknowledging they were never really an item. Bottom line, I did enjoy this it's a solid action flick with a lot of high-powered stunts and a winning performance by Jason Statham in the lead, though one wonders what sort of movie would have resulted had Frank just closed the trunk again.",3,Not much of a let down but fun to watch,1188432000,"08 30, 2007",2007,2838,"['opening', 'third', 'flick', 'far', 'best', 'part', 'Frank', 'Martin', 'three', 'rules', 'never', 'alter', 'deal', 'names', 'never', 'open', 'package', 'one', 'rules', 'movie', 'interesting', 'look', 'man', 'who', 'own', 'terms', 'extremely', 'violent', 'dangerous', 'portion', 'world', 'Unfortunately', 'girl', 'movie', 'down', 'series', 'cliches', 'explosions', 'are', 'less', 'interesting.I', 'have', 'liked', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'lot', 'not', 'just', 'English', 'gangster', 'movies', 'One', 'Jet', 'Li', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Ghosts', 'Mars', 'be', 'star', 'own', 'right', 'movie', 'co-starring', 'vehicle', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'right', 'vehicle', 'shame', 'was', 'given', 'so', 'little', 'do', 'aside', 'kicking', 'crap', 'many', 'people', 'quite', 'handily', 'lot', 'talk', 'rules', 'movie', 'movie', 'rules', 'martial', 'arts', 'onscreen', 'one', 'being', 'when', 'hero', 'facing', 'bunch', 'bad', 'guys', ""'re"", 'only', 'allowed', 'attack', 'one', 'two', 'time', ""'re"", 'not', 'allowed', 'have', 'guns', 'stand', 'so', 'close', 'hero', 'can', 'disarm', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'classic', 'shtick', 'picking', 'up', 'handy', 'item', 'use', 'weapon', 'alive', 'well', 'here', 'likewise', 'Chan', 'trademark', 'element', 'farce/slapstick', 'e.g', 'oil-slick', 'brouhaha', 'have', 'death-defying', 'stunts', 'galore', 'tire-squealing', 'car', 'chases', 'sorts', 'goings', '-on', 'somehow', 'Mr.', 'Statham', 'get', 'lost', 'proceedings.It', 'really', 'not', 'fault', 'character', 'very', 'sketchily', 'written', 'plot', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'up', 'went', 'la', 'Casablanca', 'desired', 'chemistry', 'Chinese', 'heroine', 'just', ""n't"", 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'actress', 'what', 'did', 'previously', 'know', 'cute', 'just', 'did', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'apparently', 'not', 'much', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'either', 'Bai', 'Ling', 'let', 'say', 'much', 'less', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'Kelly', 'Hu', 'dare', 'mention', 'name', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'Michelle', 'Kwan', 'cypher', 'even', 'writers', 'seem', 'have', 'grasped', 'look', 'how', 'long', 'keep', 'bound', 'gagged', 'onscreen', 'try', 'generate', 'fetishistic', 'interest', 'what', 'happening', 'Big', 'Hit', 'movie', 'kidnapped', 'Chinese', 'chick', 'falling', 'kidnapper', 'only', 'took', 'about', 'five', 'minutes', 'generate', 'romantic', 'oomph', 'one', 'never', 'really', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'including', 'usually', 'obligatory', 'closing', 'shot', 'hero', 'heroine', 'alone', 'together', 'acknowledging', 'were', 'never', 'really', 'item', 'Bottom', 'line', 'did', 'enjoy', 'solid', 'action', 'flick', 'lot', 'high-powered', 'stunts', 'winning', 'performance', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'lead', 'one', 'sort', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'resulted', 'had', 'Frank', 'just', 'closed', 'trunk', 'again']","Transporter, The"

That's what I felt after watching this hugely enjoyable action romp from director Corey Yueng who has collaborated with such as Luc Besson in the past in movies like ""Red Dragon"". This movie has a distinct European feel, not only in locations, but also direction, and one could be forgiven for thinking this was a Besson movie. This notwithstanding, it is a great roller coaster action flick, with some very well choreographed fight and action sequences. Mr Statham plays retired special forces hardman Frank Martin (why do they always retire so young?) living in the South of France who is a highly paid, feared and reveared professional courier, sporting a customized BMW, and formidable array of weapons (himself included). Regardless of the cargo, he conducts himself with consumate expertise, and deadly force where necessary, but is essentially a morally driven ""good guy"" who just happens to work as a mercenary. Quickly embroiled in a kidnapping, and attempted murder he stirs up a veritable hornets nest of villians who are not only armed to the teeth, but also ruthlessly led by a sadistic and equally die hard nemesis played by Matt Schulze. You can easily watch this movie over and over again for it's non stop action pace, and very slick direction, but the more discerning viewer, will want to leave the intellect behind, as this is pure adrenaline junky material. I would have given this movie 5 stars, but for a couple of reasons.

Of all the action stars vying for the next drop-kicking lead role, Jason Statham may be my favorite.  He just has that extra something that gives him an edge over the competition.  He knows how to break some bones, but he also possesses an `everyman' vibe to him that gives him a sense of realism.  The film has a more promising start than finish.  In fact, the brooding atmosphere and gentleness that pervades the opening half of the film is all the more sensational accompanied by the manic displays of perfectly executed violence.  The second half of the film free-falls a tad as the storyline and overall plot development becomes clich&eacute;d and formulaic, but Statham continues to use his skills to perfection and the chemistry he has with Asian beauty Qi Shu is enough to spark a flame (although I would have loved to see more of that love scene).  If you are looking for an action film with more brains than average, check this one out.

Ryan ""Merribelle""","[74, 84]","I wasn't expecting to enjoy an action flick last night, but when my hubby popped in Transporter I found my attention held almost against my will.  I don't generally choose action for my own movie nights.  Unexpectedly, the combination of incredible but well-pulled-off stunt sequences and the undeniable charisma of Jason Statham hooked me in.In case you (like most law-abiding citizens) didn't know, a transporter is the guy who not only acts as a high-priced delivery service for such savory folk as mobsters, but also occasionally lands gigs driving the getaway car from the scene of the crime.  From the opening scene where he is doing just that, our transporter, Frank Martin, is clearly the best in the business.  A series of improbable car stunts and narrow escapes during the getaway chase establishes the general fast pacing of this movie and the slick professionalism of our ""hero"".  And guys, his Beemer almost has enough gadgets to qualify as a 007 model.This transporter made the fatal error of breaking one of his own rules when a mobster hired him to deliver a package:  Never Look Inside.  Sure enough, he discovered a conscience within himself.  From that point on, his fate was set against the powerful underground smuggling cartel dealing in human cargo.The chase scenes, fight scenes, and general action that ensues throughout the film are interspersed with just enough plot twist to keep it interesting and just enough humanity to keep it grounded without becoming maudlin.  This is a somewhat toned-down version of a James Bond-like fantasy, set in the beautiful rural countryside of France and riddled with bullets and explosions that take out cars and buildings instead of entire islands.  Of course, there is the obligatory gorgeous female who can't keep her hands off of Martin.  Great for the testosterone and the estrogen all at once.In the end, the Transporter did its job:  I had fun without rolling my eyes once.-Andrea, aka Merribelle",4,Hey guys and gals!

Jason Statham is a winning action hero, strong, sexy and cool, and doing his own stunts in a fashion more bruising and bone-jarring than even a young Jackie Chan ever achieved.The story moves along at a rapid clip, and if the logic is sometimes entirely absent -- especially the lack of a response to some of the violence and explosions in the streets and in sleepy French hamlets -- the action set pieces are so good, it's hard to argue.Statham's combat scenes in particular are nothing short of amazing.

As a transporter, he gets paid lots of money to deliver packages between parties that aren't very nice. One rule is to never look in the package. Martin breaks this rule when he discovers he is transporting a live body. Martin delivers the girl, then on his way home the people who took the girl try to kill him. Frank doesn't like this, so he returns to the home where he delivered the girl and wipes them out. Frank wants to be done with the situation but the girl (beautiful Taiwan actress Qi Shu) wants him to help her find out what the bad guys are up to.This is a quirky action film. The fight scenes are set to original music that turns the martial arts laden fights almost into comedic opera. Statham's Martin is an interesting character, but almost too subdued for a viewer to sympathize with. Action films can still be entertaining without strong character development or story. This is one of those movies. The plot exists to go from one fight scene to another.The Transporter was obviously successful enough to spawn to sequels, and Jason Statham has gone on to star in many movies. Still, this movie isn't close to a Bond or Bourne film. This is a good movie to rent to see if you'll like its type of Hong-Kong martial arts-type action.

Pfleeger,"[8, 12]","There are intellegent action movies, those with interesting plotting, those with chemistry between the leads: The Transporter is not one of those films. The Transporter is action qua action.The plot (what there is of one) is simple Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is a transporter. He is the personthat can get any package anywhere no questions asked. Sort of the Fed Ex version of James Bond. Martin lives by three simple rules: 1) Don't change the deal, 2) Don't ask for names and 3) Don't look in the package. On a routine transport Frank breaks one of his rules and finds beautiful Lai (Qi Shu) in a bag. Lai's father and a mobster named Wall Street are importing slaves in cargo containers into Marseilles. This must be stopped. It is here that all semblence of reality goes out the window and the movie reverts to mindless action.There is not much holding the film together and at times looks like one big extended car chase/ fight scene.  Sort of a BMW commercial with violence. The film is the English language debut feature of martial arts director Corey Yuen. Yuen was helped by French action director Luc Besson. Their collaboration leads to a beautiful looking film that really is a bit of a mess.Statham may be an up and coming actor in the Jean Claude van Damme mode but he is not there yet. Shu is quite beautiful but she has not mastered enough of English to be more than eye candy and the PG-13 rating does not help to create the sexual chemistry necessary for the pair to work.This Fox DVD has additional star and producer commentary, a making of featurette, and extended fight scenes with or without commentary. The added fight scenes , to be honest, didn't look a whole lot different from what appeared in the finished cut of the film. A problem with the special features is that some are located on each side of the disc. I hate flipping discs to get to other featres.On the whole the Transporter doesn't offer much more than mindless action . Check your brain at the door and watch it for what it is.

737429,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00008AOVL,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","I'm not a huge fan of action movies, and I really didn't have high hopes for this one, but The Transporter turned out to be a pretty enjoyable flick.  The story, the action, and the characters are all held together by the cinematic equivalent of Crazy Glue, but somehow that doesn't really matter all that much.  This movie is really all about the action, which comes at you almost non-stop.  It pushes the envelope of realism to the breaking point a few times, but it's unusual and therefore interesting.  Jason Statham is basically a one-man wrecking crew, and he has a style all his own (which lies somewhere in between traditional martial arts and basic street thug tactics).  It's quick and intense and, most of all, purely entertaining.  I've never seen a fight such as that waged on an oil-covered surface by Frank and an assembly of goons.  It's just one example of a slight comic touch that seems to define much of the action and special effects - you will witness several ""oh, come on!"" moments in this film.We don't learn a whole lot about Frank Martin (Jason Statham).  We know he is ex-military and that he currently earns his living transporting dubious goods.  He's a meticulous perfectionist who lives by a few simple rules - or at least he did, until his current job came along.  It should have been simple - pick the bag up here, drive it to there, deliver it, and go home 40 Gs richer.  A flat tire changes all that, as he can't help but notice the bag resting atop his spare tire in the trunk is moving.  Enter Lai (Qi Shu), undoubtedly the most attractive piece of cargo he's ever transported.  Now you might expect Frank to let the girl go - but Frank always honors his deals.  That would have been the end of the story if his client hadn't double-crossed him in the end.  They really shouldn't have made Frank angry.As luck would have it, though, Lai seems to have established some sort of bond with Frank.  Coming to the aid of a damsel in distress isn't really part of his nature, but Lai shows no compunction to flee from this man who was himself less than kind to her.  She tells him a story of Chinese citizens being shipped via packing crate for lives of slavery, and he eventually gets involved in the whole mess - but only after those same guys come calling in a most direct fashion.  There's a weird dichotomy between Frank and the local police investigator that moves the plot along to its conclusion, which is actually a good thing since the slave trade story tends to meander a bit on its own.Frankly, I don't find Jason Statham charismatic at all, although he's certainly efficient at what he does.

Jason Statham is very comfortable in this role and I hope to see much more from him in the future.As stated, the opening of the film is killer and the premise is quite intriguing, formulaic though it is.

Jason has participated in several films before Transporter in somewhat lesser roles such as ""The One"" and ""The Italian Job"", but the Transporter finally lets this man shine - and he brings a character to the screen - Frank Martin - who is intelligent, skillful, strong and one downright cool guy.The movie has a good and promising beginning, showing off the cool factor of Frank Martin immediately.  Followed quickly by an intense car chase scene, the movie never lets up after that - whether it be action or suspense.  The story is not too interesting, but it is put together well.  Frank discovers that a package he is transporting is carrying a live body inside.  Frank's ""tough-guy attitude"" is worn down and he breaks his own rule by opening the package.  The receiver of the package is no dummy, and realizes that Frank broke the rules and has his car destroyed.  Frank, fortunately absent from his car during the explosion, seeks revenge but ends up with company along the way by accident - the girl inside the package.  From here the story begins to take off as Frank becomes entangled in the situation all the more.While there isn't a tremendouns amount of action, the spacing of action works well enough.  The final 20 minutes are huge, easily containing the best scenes in the movie.  I especially liked the fights in the bus garage and the final highway truck scene which reminded me very much of the truck scene from ""Raider of the Lost Ark"".Transporter is a great movie for Jason Statham.

737441,A3MOHNZBTDGRRJ,B00008AOVL,"D. Phillips ""Film fanatic and librarian""","[3, 3]","Corey Yuen the director has churned out enjoyable Hong Kong type actioners for some time.  He's always seemed to exist in John Woo's shadow.  He churns out enjoyable sturdy films (usually with Jet Li) but somehow just short of the brilliance and originality that John Woo wowed the world with.  He continues in that vein with The Transporter.  A thoroughly enjoyable but (with the exception of the lead performance) unremarkable action film.Jason Stratham plays a mercenary transporter who will transport anything for a fee no questions asked.  He has a set of fixed rules that he follows without deviation.  On one mission he breaks his own rule and opens the package that he is assigned to carry.  The result is his life is in danger and he has to take on the mob to live again.Stratham is the stand out here.  Even though the script barely flushes out a character for him to play he manages to convey the essence of his character through the set of his jaw, the tenseness with which he holds himself, his clipped responses. It's a beautiful physical performanc and enhances the film even without the humor that Jackie Chan or Harrison Ford often convey in their best work.  He moves well in the action sequences and is fit without being an overmuscled Stallone, Schwarzenegger, or Diesel type.Unfortunately, Stratham is the only actor who stands out. Qi Shu who plays the female lead seems to just squeal and seek protection.  She seems almost creepily suppliant to Stratham.  The villains seem pretty generic as does the Francois Berleand as the detective after Stratham.  Berleand's accent is so thick that I couldn't even understand him when he was talking about Proust. Fortunately, his dialogue scenes are brief.If you're looking for action, the film delivers on all counts in numerous beautifully shot and staged car chases, explosions and martial arts style fights.  Except for one or two implausible plot points the script is efficient and sets up a nifty premise (though I still have a feeling there is a truck not accounted for by the end of the film).  The movie overdoes the hip-hop and music blasts.  The music seems so generic and just there to add market value that it takes away from the atmosphere of the film.Still a decent film with a great star making performance in it.

No questions asked?""That's the line that started all the fun, suspense, and action in the new Jason Stantom film The Transporter. The Transporter opens with a car chase scene which is a great way to start an action movie. The movie is about Frank Martin who is an ex British miltary man who now transports illigal goods for all sorts of people for money. Frank is a man of rules and has rules such as ""no names"" and ""never open the package."" Anyway, after getting hired to transport a large package to a man who goes by the name Wall Street he gets a flat tire. Opening the truck where the package is to get the tire the package is moving around. Frank becomes overpowered by curiosity and opens the package to find Lai. He gives her a drink and allows her to go to the bathroom and then delivers her to Wall Street(after chasing her in the woods). Wall Street ask's if Frank could transport another item. Unfortualty it's a bomb to kill Frank for opening the package but luckily it goes off while Frank is taking a break. Frank goes back to Wall Street and then steals his car. Lai follows and begs him to let her stay with him. The two fall in love and learn Lai tells him that her family and 400 other Asian's are being sent the Wall Street and his thugs to become slaves. It's illigal in ever single way. Lai and Frank are agast when they learn that Lai's father is in on it too and they try to stop Wall Street and Lai's father in the action packed movie of the year.The Transporter has an equal share of drama and action. When it's in drama you could actually feel what the character's are feeling. When it action it simply a thrill ride.

The late 80's &amp; early 90's was a time in movies when one man could take on a whole crime syndicate by himself and win. I mean look at the similarities in place here: One white guy takes on an asian bad guy with a cool, tough talking henchman. He gets the asian girl and he uses kicks and punches more than he uses guns. I mean it's like I was watching a Van Damme movie made in the year 2002.That's not to say this is a bad movie. Just don't go into this expecting great acting or a drama filled plot. Jason Statham plays a Transporter. Basically he will transport anything to any location for a fee &amp; no questions asked. He has certain rules that have to be abided by. He ends up breaking one of his own rules by opening a package that he was paid to transport by a rather bad man (Matt Schulze). He finds a young asian girl (Shu Qi) inside the bag. To make a long story short, the bad guy tries to blow up the transporter. He gets pissed. Goes back to bad guy's house and preceeds to kick everyone's ass. And so the movie starts.Like I said, this will not win awards for writing or acting. It's a fun action movie. That simple. Jason Statham makes it better than it should be by being a decent actor. This is a Van Damme movie with a WAY better lead actor. He shows that he can be a lead in an action film and make it work. I would love to see more of him in this genre. The rest of the cast is rather average. Statham definately owns this movie. And that's the way it should be in a action beat-up movie.I would check this out if you like mindless action flicks. This tries it's hard to be a Hong Kong martial arts action movie. It doesn't get to that point, but it's definately worth owning if you can find it for cheap.The DVD itself is pretty good. I can't complain about the picture or the sound.

An English actor, Statham was born in Sydenham, on the south east London, growing up playing football and diving. His first experience with movies came from being cast by Guy Ritchie, British director in a 1998 hit Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and later in the 2000 film Snatch.In 2002 Statham was cast in the role of Frank Martin, a driver that transports cargo without asking questions and under strict rules: Stick to the deal, Don't ask names and Don't look in the package. Statham's martial arts background allows him to perform most of his own stunts and it is simply thrilling to observe him in action.The first Transporter brings us a hard driving courier that soon enough brakes one of his own rules, looking to see what he is carrying to find a beautiful young woman that involves him in the inhuman trade of people to be used as slaves.Frank Martin is good at what he does but when he gets involved and his passion is aroused he is a lethal weapon, unstoppable and effective.

I'd say it was a movie about cars, but that's really only true for the first 1/3rd of it. I'd say it was also about cool kung fu, but that's only for the middle 1/3rd of it. And I'd say it was about waaaaay over the top fight sequences and physics defying stunts, but that was the last 1/3rd of it. So I guess I'll start with the first 1/3rd of the movie and work my way through it in sequence, so that we all know how well this movie started, and why it developed 4 flat wheels, blew its head gasket, and subsequently ran off of a cliff. By the way, ""SPOILERS AHEAD!"". Consider yourself warned!Jason Stratham is a ""transporter"", that is a professional wheelman, or for those of you not in the know, a getaway car driver. Clients, typically those with criminal tendencies who need someone with a good set of wheels and the skills to use them, contact Stratham's character, Frank Martin, and contract him to serve as their getaway driver. And the man plies his trade with unbelievable skill, without so much as a dent or scratch. Frank lives a life of seclusion along the beaches of France after retiring from the military. At least that's his cover to local police investigator Tarconi (played well by really likable Francois Berleand) who is ever suspicious of our main character.Frank is very careful in his job. He lives by 3 rules; 1 - Never change the deal, 2 - No names mentioned, and 3 - Never open the package. When Frank takes a light job transporting such a package in his trunk, he breaks one of his own rules and looks inside the package to discover a Chinese girl inside. Still trying to maintain his business ""ethics"" Frank pretends he didn't see anything and delivers the package to the intended client, a smarmy playboy/crime lord type played by Matthew Schulze...who I'm pretty sure was hitting on our hero there for a moment. I think. At any rate Schulze's character knows that Frank's looked inside the package, and attempts to kill him via the use of an exploding suitcase he's asked Frank to transport to another client.Now, up until this point in the movie everything was working hunkey-dory, which is when the director decided to pour about 2 lbs. of sugar into the gas tank. Stratham, having narrowly avoided being killed, goes on a kung-fu rampage against the goons at Schulze's house, and once finished there steals his Mercedes, one that has a certain Chinese woman hiding in the back seat. This is where the movie starts to ask you to suspend your disbelief. It will be asking this a lot of you in the remaining hour of the film, and in ever-increasing levels.From here we know that the Chinese woman, played by rather cute Shu Qi, is named ""Lai"" and was being used as some kind of bartering chip, or as a hostage, or something. The movie is never really clear on why she was being transported, although I guess it might be because she's nosy and put her cute nose somewhere it didn't belong. At any rate Frank cuts Lai loose in his seaside villa and the two ponder their next move. The next morning, Frank's house is attacked by a bunch of goons armed with enough ordinance to make 3 sequels.After the predictable escape and a totally out of left field sex scene, the plot tells us that this whole mess is about 400 Chinese people trapped in some shipping containers that are about to enter port. Lai wants Frank to help her rescue those people from Schulze and her father, some sort of demented Chinese business man/crime lord with no sideburns. The plot kind of goes in several different directions at this point, and at no time follows anything remotely resembling the word ""linear"", although ""predictable"" somehow becomes the mantra of the entire film. There's more kung-fu in this movie than you can shake a chopstick at, and enough over the top antics to keep you paying attention long after the plot has ceased to matter. And it will cease to matter, trust me. And the stuff that just totally disregards physics...it's mind boggling. Here's an impromptu list of absurdities that would keep Einstein busy with formulas long after he'd conquered the Theory of Relativity.- How exactly did Lai manage to open the door on the car while taped into an office chair, let alone climb into the thing?- Bullets ricocheting off of oil soaked concrete don't make sparks, but will blow up an oil can floating in the ocean- One can throw a tire iron, while off balance and clinging to the underside of a truck moving at 60+ mph, with only one hand and successfully smack a driver in a car 10 feet away through an open window. And right in his temple. Ow.- 200 Chinese people will easily fit in a truck trailer, with lots of room to spare. Also they don't go to the bathroom or eat for a week at a time. When Lai opened the back doors it should have smelled like a poop factory in overdrive. Instead one slightly disheveled child meanders out and the trailer isn't even half packed.- The piece de la resistance. The infamous parachute scene. Are we supposed to believe that after an impromptu drop (never mind that he dropped from the plane in front of the convoy and then magically appears behind it, in mid-air) from 500 feet that his expensive steerable parachute (which all crop dusters are equipped with) travels at least 70mph? I'm not even going to touch the probability of his actually even being able to *land* on top of the truck, let alone getting into physical contact with it. I don't think there are Navy SEALS alive that could duplicate this one.Other things I learned from this film:- All hired goons are masters of the martial arts, in one form or another.- Said goons are pretty courteous, always taking the time to attack people one at a time, even when outnumbering them 10 to 1.- Chinese women on the lam can cook local cuisine on their first try and not only make it edible, but make one overly sentimental about it. I wanna see Lai try doing pit-cooked pork shoulder barbecue in one try. Then I'll be a believer.- European truck cabs are big enough to be apartments- European buses have lots of foot long metal bars laying around on the floor. If you ever find yourself in one and wonder why watch this movie and you'll understand.- A stethoscope and a submachine gun are standard ship container searching equipment- French gendarmes apparently drive in subcompact police cars. This may be fact, but if the local police here start using Honda Civics I *will* be moving.So after all this, why give the movie 3 stars? Well, to a certain degree there were some things the movie got right. The first 1/3rd of the movie is fantastic. I really, really enjoyed it and wish that the director could have kept it going. The soundtrack is surprisingly good. The music used fits the different scenarios nicely and adds just the right amount of feeling for the scenes.This is a movie that caters to a particular kind of viewer. If you enjoyed ""Ronin"" or ""Heat"" this is *not* going to be your cup of tea. If you loved either of the ""Matrix"" sequels (unlike the original, which was pretty solid), ""The Fast and the Furious"", or ""xXx"" this is gonna be a wonderful experience for you, one you'll want to hastily add to your collection of style over substance collection. And you know who you are. :)",3,A Triumph of Style *over* Substance,1201737600,"01 31, 2008",2008,7308,"['Ay', 'Caramba', 'Where', 'start', 'fast', 'paced', 'Ronin', 'stock', 'Jet', 'Li', 'movie',

I also started noticing in all the areas where most movies enhance the violence and gore this movie stops and leaves it to the imagination. MANY CUDO'S FOR THAT. I could only imagine some of the horrible things that happened, I didn't have to see it. That's actually makes more of an impact on the mind. GREAT IDEA! It's like a scary movie, if you don't know where the killer is or if you haven't seen the monster that's lurking it's much scarier.

Unfortunately he makes the cardinal mistake one day and finds out what the package is.  His employers take exception to this and the action/adventure slugfest is running at full speed.This movie has a mediocre plot (the romance that blossoms and the immigrant storyline is somewhat cheesy) that is quite simply saved by the impressive direction and choreography of the action.

It simply means one who transports goods from place to place. Frank Martin (Jason Stratham) is an ex-army operative who feels that he was fighting a futile war. Since the end of his service Martin decides to move to France, live off his army pension and live an easy life transporting sensitive materials no questions asked. This is an interesting idea as the opening contains a rather impressive, yet ludicrous car chase.The film although interesting has the rather large let down of falling into cliches. It seems that many of the lines used by Stratham, seemed to hve been impressive in action films of the past. But they just dont work here. The femme fatal in this rather uninspired story is Lai (Qi Shu), who not only screams alot, but also her performance, like Stratham's becomes very tiresome over the course of the film.The direction really is nothing special and it's almost as if director Corey Yuen couldn't decide whether to make 'The Transporter' a realistic, hard hitting action film or an over the top specticle as seen in 'xXx'. The result is a wishy washy attempt at an action film, that doesn't really allow the audience to have the fun they could if all realism was thrown out the window. It's a little like keeping a big dog on a leash, although that's a fairly specious anecdote.The overall effect of 'The Transporter' is of disappointment.

737490,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00008AOVL,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[0, 0]","'Some Rules Should Never Be Broken' could have easily been a tagline used in the advertising for this movie. Sometimes when we break the rules the consequences really hit us hard, which is the case for the main character Frank Martin, in the Cory Yuen (acclaimed Japanese action film director) directed surprise smash hit ""The Transporter"" starring Jason Statham.""The Transporter"" focuses on ex-special forces soldier Frank Martin (Jason Statham) who makes a living transporting various items for high-paying clients who value timeliness, reliability, and above all else, secrecy. He is a man whose life is dictated by a strict set of rules that he abides by; however, on his most recent job Frank makes a costly mistake. He breaks what could be called his 'Cardinal rule', the one that dictates the transporter is to never open the package he is delivering. But once the rule is broken there's no going back. Now, Frank finds himself on the run with the very package he was assigned to deliver, a young Asian girl who has been trailing an international slave trading ring, and he must summon all of his training if both himself and his package are to survive the pursuit.I'll be honest, when this movie was first advertised to arrive in theaters, I really didn't give much thought to seeing it. There didn't seem to be all that much appeal to my tastes in the movie. To me, I thought it was just another mindless action flick with little to no story, having one action scene after another being held together by flimsy dialogue that wouldn't have even been acceptable by B-movie standards. So, needless to say I merely forgot about the movie for quite some time, until I happened to catch a glimpse of the trailer for the sequel. What caught my eye with this preview was the fact that if this kind of movie was getting a sequel, then maybe there was more to the original film than I had given it credit for. So, shortly before the release of the sequel, I decided to break down and rent ""The Transporter"" figuring if nothing else, it will distract me for at least 90 minutes, and who knows maybe I'll even be entertained on some level. After all, someone must have thought the original was pretty good if it warranted a theatrically released sequel rather than one that is straight-to-DVD as most sequels of this variety would have been.The story for ""The Transporter"" isn't deep by any means, lets not kid ourselves about that. Even though it's not all that original, and contains a basic plot that has been used countless times before, the dialogue was surprisingly well-written, and the fights were flat-out impressive during some of the action sequences, that you easily overlook the simplicity of the story. Of course, when watching a movie such as this, you really aren't looking for something all that complicated, so there are times when simplicity is the better way to go, and this movie is definitely one of those times.But this movie would have been nothing if not for the charismatic screen presence of the movie's lead, Jason Statham (""The Italian Job""). Statham brought such an easy going attitude to the character of Frank Martin, when coupled with his intense charisma and screen presence, he took what was a run-of-the-mill action flick and elevated it into a hugely entertaining and memorable action movie that thrills audiences from start to finish. The supporting actors were mostly solid in their performances, all the characters were heavily cliched, but some of the actors appeared to take it upon themselves to add depth to their characters, allowing for a much more enjoyable experience. It's no doubt in my mind that they were the primary reasons that this movie wound up becoming a big hit in theaters, raising this film above the mediocrity it was most likely destined for.Regardless of how good the actors or the story for any action movie may be, the movie will be nothing if it doesn't feature impressive action sequences that blow the audiences socks off. Which is exactly what many of the numerous action scenes do in ""The Transporter"", and what's more impressive is that Jason Statham performed a majority of all his stunts. With his intense screen presence that can't be ignored, and his impressive athletic ability as showcased in the numerous fight/stunt sequences it's easy to see why Statham is quickly becoming Hollywood's newest action hero.If you are a fan of martial arts movies, action films from the likes of Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van Damme, then ""The Transporter"" is a movie that will be of great interest to you. And in my opinion, will entertain you ten times more than any of Seagal or Van Damme's efforts from recent years, plus the acting and storytelling are better than most entries are in this genre.""The

This movie should begin to give Statham a name in the industry in America I hope. I want to see more of him and less of that ... Vin Diesel.This movie was terribly directed. The music is really dumb and constantly missused. Some moments that should have no music have some dumb techno playing that kind of ruins the moment. Some scenes are overly dramatic due to the use of the music. The music of a movie may not seem like such an important thing when it is done well, if it is done bad however,it creates noticable problems for the movie.The story of the movie was well not existant which for some action movies it is not such a bad thing, but it is so bad when you compare it to the creativity of the fight scenes you find yourself saying ""okay just skip to the next fight scene."" Also the effects they try with the bullet tracers on the guns should have been tossed out. It was a little too cheesy I thought. I did want to see Statham gunning down more foes with those two silver handguns that he has on the promotional poster (which he never has two at a time)though.The acting was so-so. Not bad on Statham's behalf, but I absolutely cannot stand the guy that was in Fast and the Furious and Blade II. He is a terrible actor and should be kicked out of the industry. I am always glad when he is killed in the movies.To sum things up, if you want a watered down PG-13 action movie (would have been better at an R rating)that you can fast foward through without having to worry about what is going on  this is the one for you.

The package is a chinese girl Lai (played by delightful Shu Qi), whose father is involved in smugling Chinese slaves.  She wants to stop his father and in a process involves the transporter, who happens to be very well trained in combat.  Here the chase and the non-stop action begin with one good guy fighting against a whole organized gang of bad guys.Other than the chases and fight scenes, and in spite of the unbelievable scenes, I liked the Frank's character - his head is screwed on right - he is focused on what he is doing, he is well-organized, he plans whatever can be planned and when things don't work out, he just moves on - there is no waste of time or energy on bemoaning one's destiny or planning vengance for damages suffered.

Jason Statham who is in theatres now in ""The Italian Job"" was on the British Olympic team in Seoul in 1988 and puts his athleticism to good use in the many action sequences in the film.  Particularly intricate, the DVD shows how the fight scene in the cab of the truck was staged, making maximum use of movement in a confined space.  Similarly, the sequence on the bus is excellent and the comparison cuts on the DVD of interest.  I also appreciated that it was cold in the sequences with the oil, which was actually syrup, and that you could actually see Statham's breath in the extended fight sequences.  Matt Schulze who lost about 40 pounds from his appearance in ""The Fast & the Furious"" so he could literally fit into the truck cab fight sequence does a nice job as the villain ""Wall Street.""  Robert Mark Kamen also wrote screenplays for ""A Walk in the Clouds"" with Keeanu Reeves, ""The 5th Element,"" and all parts of ""The Karate Kid.""  I like how he handled the romance with Lai, Chinese actress Shu Qi.  It seemed like the chemistry clicked.  Ric Young who I've watched numerous times in ""The Corruptor"" has also appeared in ""7 Years in Tibet"" and ""Nixon.""  He does a great job of being unlikable as Lai's crime-boss father Mr. Kwai.  I particularly appreciated the cameo appearance of French actor Francois Berleand as Tarconi the police detective.  What great soulfulness in his eyes as he takes a fairly minor character and gives it a great fullness and believability.  Jazz great Stanley Clarke's music score was also excellent.  Some of the plot does stretch believability in a James Bond sort of way such as parachuting to the top of a moving truck; however, if we believe Bond can parachute into a moving plane, perhaps this is great cinematic magic too.

It plays like a young man's fantasy - fast cars, things that blow up, and a pretty girl to decorate the scene.  The English actor, Jason Statham, is cast as the cooler than cool hero.  He lives is opulent splendor on the French Riviera and is supposedly a former soldier with the British Special Forces. He now makes a living by transporting packages and/or people in his luxury BMW car.  For example, the beginning of the film shows him pulling up at exactly the right moment at a bank heist.  Four bank robbers in masks rush to get picked up.  ""The agreement called for three,"" he says.  There is no time to argue as the police are closing in and so they shoot one of their members and throw him out of the car.  Of course there is a car chase, with dozens of police cars falling off cliffs or banging into each other as the transporter's car leaps over barriers and is totally immune to all the bullets being shot at him.  And that's just the first five minutes.The transporter's next job consists of delivering a small suitcase to a location.  All goes well until he gets a flat tire, opens the trunk and sees the suitcase moving.  When he opens it, he finds the lovely Qi Shi, a pretty young Chinese actress who manages her role well, in spite of the fact that she speaks very little English.  No problem though because there is very little dialog anyway.  Mostly, things blow up, including our hero's luxury house and the pair are forced into a daring underwater escape.  There is more and more action and more and more people getting killed and some sort of redeeming value in the plot about saving Chinese slaves from a cargo container.  The most important thing in this kind of film, however, are special effects and  the martial arts of the hero who can knock out a dozen armed men with a few well-placed kicks.This is a film targeted to teenage boys.  So what is it that kept the eyes of a mature lady like me so glued to the screen?  Perhaps its because the action was so intense and outrageous that it just locked in my attention in a way that wound up to be totally relaxing.  By all my generally standards I should have hated this film.  But sometimes I like to take a mini-vacation from anything meaningful.

On a seemingly simple job, he breaks one of his own rules (rule 3: never look in the package) and his entire world blows up in his face. Suddenly, Frank is sucked into a dark world of human slavery and organized crime.The fight scenes are amazing to watch, they held me spellbound, and the chase scenes are simply fun.

The Transporter might just fall into this category.  Just about every scene in this movie contains a car wreck, fight, or explosion.  After a while, you almost get bored with the constant action.  Some of the fight scenes are totally unbelievable, guys are just standing around waiting to get kicked in the pie-hole.  If this were a video game, I would be complaining about how bad the enemy A.I. was.  One scene where ""The Transporter"" tries to commandeer a truck, is almost a identical rip-off of the truck scene in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", only not even half as good (or humorous).  After all is said and done, I do have to give the director and writers credit for making a consistent action movie, there is no fall off here, from the start of the movie till the end, kick-butt action!Bottom Line:If you can overlook the rip-offs and stupid fight scenes the movie is definitely worth a look.

I was therefore very excited to see that he's taken a real step up in `The Transporter,"" where he plays an operator hired to ferry illicit material via car from one specified point to another.  As such, the premise is weak.  (Why would you need to hire someone to do this?)  But the film, which is overflowing with both action and incredulity, is entertaining nonetheless.Jason falls for a cute Oriental Babe, Shu Qi, whom he discovers in the trunk of his car stuffed into the zippered satchel that he's delivering.  She has gorgeous eyes and shapely legs.  Her beauty, unfortunately, doesn't improve appreciably once the duct tape binding her mouth is removed.Her Confucian father, however, is an even pricier piece of work.  He has wild eyes and plastic looking skin.  But even more distracting is the spidery toupee he wears that looks, on most occasions, as though he applied it to his scalp backwards!The movie's action sequences and cinematography, thankfully, are first rate.  Jason spends a lot of time driving a pristine black BMW around the lovely streets of Monaco.  He dodges armor piercing rounds and wire guided missiles which completely destroy his house.  He does a reasonable imitation of both Jet Li and Jackie Chan as he brawls (seriously and comically) with numerous bad guys throughout the film.  And he finishes with an exciting Vin Diesel XXX-like drop-from-the-sky-by-parachute-rendezvous to hijack a Mercedes eighteen-wheeler led convoy to save the day - and win the girl - while simultaneously rescuing us from her father's hideous appearance once and for all!If you watch this feature, don't bother counting the flaws in the plot.

His code of conduct is, never change the terms of the deal, never learn each others names, and NEVER look in the package. His latest assignment involves tranporting a duffel bag across europe, and he winds up violating the golden rule and finds Lai (Mega-babe Shu Qi, in her first american film), a somewhat talkative Chinese girl. She reveals that her father is a slave trader, and wants her as part of the family business. With this information, Frank reforms and agrees to help Lai bust up her father's operation.

Forget the ""realism"" with regard to firearms. The story itself is so clich&eacute;d I could barely believe it was being rehashed one more time.

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[3, 5]","Louis Leterrier and Corey Yuen's 2002 film ""The Transporter"" can be best described as watching a live-action video game: the film offers lots of action within the framework of a very weak plot.  The film's main character, Frank Martin (Jason Statham), earns his living as a mercenary, who stealthily transports items (including people) across Europe in his black BMW, which he meticulously maintains in immaculate condition.  He prefers to work on a nameless, ""no questions asked"", basis with his clientele, but demands exacting descriptions of the cargo with regard to dimensions and weight. He is paid quite handsomely for his services so that he can live in a rustic house overlooking the Mediterranean Sea along the southern coast of France. A local policeman, Tarconi (Franois Berl&eacute;and), keeps a close eye on Frank by making unexpected visits to his seaside home.  When Frank is hired to transport his latest package, he notices that it moves when it is dropped into the trunk of his BMW.  Along his leisurely drive to transport the 'item', he stops for food and makes the mistake of offering water to the person inside his trunk, an annoying woman named Lai (Qi Shu).  Having violated his own rules, Frank gets himself into trouble with her consignee, Darren 'Wall Street' Bettencourt (Matt Schulze), who attempts to kill Frank.  Frank returns to seek his revenge upon Bettencourt, but unwittingly rescues Lai and continues to dig himself deeper into trouble.The biggest flaw in the film is the development of Frank Martin's character.  Initially, he is presented as being a very cold, uncaring and calculating perfectionist who is prepared for virtually any situation.  When he feels sympathy for the person that he's transporting in his trunk and becomes embroiled with her problems, it comes across as being totally unapt.  Another major flaw is the film's editing, which is highly reminiscent of playing a video game: i.e., people suddenly appearing out of nowhere and Frank's very elaborate defenses conveniently matching every circumstance.  The film does have a few memorable scenes including the demonstrations of Jason Statham's martial arts skills, the bank robbers, and Frank's home being attacked.The acting is average to below-average (especially Qi Shu and Ric Young, who plays her father Mr. Kwai) and the weak plot is predictable.  However, the constant m&eacute;lange of flying bullets, rocket-propelled grenades, explosions and car chases make for a mildly entertaining film that I rate with 3 out of 5 stars.  If you are looking for a lot of action, but don't care about plot, ""The Transporter"" can give you just that.  If you haven't seen the film, I advise renting it first to determine if this is a film that you want to watch more than once.",3,"Weak Plot, But Mildly Entertaining Film Like a Video Game",1053043200,"05 16, 2003",2003,2777,"['Louis', 'Leterrier', 'Corey', 'Yuen', '2002', 'film', 'Transporter', 'can', 'be', 'best', 'described', 'watching', 'live-action', 'video', 'game', 'film', 'lots', 'action', 'framework', 'very', 'weak', 'plot', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'Frank', 'Martin', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'living', 'mercenary', 'who', 'stealthily', 'items', 'including', 'people', 'Europe', 'black', 'BMW', 'meticulously', 'immaculate', 'condition', 'work', 'nameless', 'questions', 'asked', 'basis', 'clientele', 'exacting', 'descriptions', 'cargo', 'regard', 'dimensions', 'weight', 'paid', 'quite', 'handsomely', 'services', 'so', 'can', 'live', 'rustic', 'house', 'overlooking', 'Mediterranean', 'Sea', 'southern', 'coast', 'France', 'A', 'local', 'policeman', 'Tarconi', 'Franois', 'Berl', 'eacute', 'close', 'eye', 'Frank', 'making', 'unexpected', 'visits', 'seaside', 'home', 'When', 'Frank', 'hired', 'transport', 'latest', 'package', 'when', 'dropped', 'trunk', 'BMW', 'leisurely', 'drive', 'transport', ""'item"", 'food', 'mistake', 'offering', 'water', 'person', 'trunk', 'annoying', 'woman', 'named', 'Lai', 'Qi', 'Shu', 'Having', 'violated', 'own', 'rules', 'Frank', 'trouble', 'consignee', 'Darren', ""'Wall"", 'Street', 'Bettencourt', 'Matt', 'Schulze', 'who', 'kill', 'Frank', 'Frank', 'seek', 'revenge', 'Bettencourt', 'unwittingly', 'rescues', 'Lai', 'dig', 'deeper', 'trouble.The', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'film', 'development', 'Frank', 'Martin', 'character', 'Initially', 'presented', 'being', 'very', 'cold', 'uncaring', 'calculating', 'perfectionist', 'who', 'prepared', 'virtually', 'situation', 'When', 'sympathy', 'person', 'transporting', 'trunk', 'embroiled', 'problems', 'being', 'totally', 'unapt', 'major', 'flaw', 'film', 'editing', 'highly', 'reminiscent', 'playing', 'video', 'game', 'i.e.', 'people', 'suddenly', 'appearing', 'nowhere', 'Frank', 'very', 'elaborate', 'defenses', 'conveniently', 'matching', 'circumstance', 'film', 'have', 'few', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'including', 'demonstrations', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'bank', 'robbers', 'Frank', 'home', 'being', 'attacked.The', 'acting', 'average', 'below-average', 'especially', 'Qi', 'Shu', 'Ric', 'Young', 'who', 'father', 'Mr.', 'Kwai', 'weak', 'plot', 'predictable', 'However', 'constant', 'm', 'eacute', 'lange', 'flying', 'bullets', 'rocket-propelled', 'grenades', 'explosions', 'car', 'chases', 'make', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'rate', '3', '5', 'stars', 'are', 'looking', 'lot', 'action', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'plot', 'Transporter', 'can', 'give', 'just', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'advise', 'renting', 'first', 'determine', 'film', 'want', 'watch', 'more', 'once']","Transporter, The"

The stunts are amazing: from the opening car chase to the multiple battles featuring Jason Statham vs. Large Group of Bad Guys.  I challenge anyone to watch this movie and not say &quot;Whoa!&quot; at least ten times throughout the duration.Statham holds his own in his first starring role, sometimes shirtless and covered in oil (a little something for the ladies).  He proves to be the right mixture of brood and mystery needed for this type of action hero.  And anyone should be impressed with an actor who did a lot of his own stunts (either that or his stuntman is a perfect doppleganger).Overall, the movie is great fun, but it's not to be taken seriously.

737525,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00008AOVL,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 4]","Jason Statham began his solo action hero career with a film made by two diverse kings of cool cinema: writer Luc Besson and director Corey Yuen, the latter making his return to American cinema over a decade after his contributions to theNo Retreat, No Surrenderseries. With such a collection of talent to drive the production, a guy like me expected great things, but ended up sort of disappointed. It's hard to criticize the film since there's nothing really wrong with it and it has some really cool moments, but overall it seems to merely graze the target instead of nailing it.The story: Frank Martin (Statham,The Expendables) is a transporter - an expert auto driver and fighting machine who'll deliver anything in his car, even armed bank robbers making their getaway, if the price is right - who finds himself caught up in a deadly game of human trafficking when he finds out that his latest delivery is a kidnapped young woman (Qi Shu,Gorgeous) with knowledge of a massive moving operation of immigrant slaves...Since his solo debut with this movie, Jason Statham has been the only performer in the last decade-and-a-half of Hollywood who's consistently thrown himself into the role of action hero. Forget Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel, and even Sylvester Stallone - none of them can match Statham's track record, and he has a considerable leg up on them thanks to his indulgence in martial arts. With that said, while he does pretty good drama-wise, his physical talents don't seem fully realized here. The fight scenes compose only about 50% of the film's total action content, but as the attraction I was most looking forward to, their lack of consistency weighs more heavily on this review than it might on others. While I liked the fight on the bus and got a kick out of the oily garage brawl, all of the encounters seem overly reliant on dreadful quick-cut editing, and at least the first one also indulges in debilitating close-ups. Statham's kicks are nice, but the nicest of them - a sort of flipping dropkick - was almost definitely performed by a double. The vehicle scenes are pretty good also, with the highway chase drawing parallels to the one inRaiders of the Lost Ark, but they're not what I'm after.The story and characterizations are stronger than you'd expect from a run-of-the-mill action flick, and what else would you expect with Luc Besson behind the pen? The relationship between Statham's character and Qi Shu's is nice, despite including mandatory out-of-nowhere sex, and I love how endlessly hammy and obviously evil the main villain played by Matt Schulze is. He'd pretty much play the same role two years later against Steven Seagal inOut of Reach, but it's a bit more refined here and able to be taken seriously. With that said, the film definitely has a problem with its pacing - the finale really sort of sneaks up on you - and I can't help but reference that indecisive feeling of unfulfillment that comes with movies that Besson wrote/produced but didn't direct. The man got so much juice out of films likeLeonandLa Femme Nikita, whereas in comparison something like this that has his handprint on it but not his auteurship sort of feels like a full-course meal that was interrupted midway through. Corey Yuen is my favorite action director of all, but drama- and development-wise he just can't hold a candle to what ol' Luc can do (co-director Lous Leterrier would do much better on his own three years later, when he directed Besson's Jet Li vehicleUnleashed).In a surprising turn, the film's PG-13 rating doesn't work against it: blood and excessive language isn't missed. It's a decent action movie and probably more accessible to general viewers than any number of other offerings from both Statham and Yuen, but it's definitely not the best work of anybody involved.

He is disciplined, organized, patient, precise, and always on time.  Until his curiousity gets the better of him and he stumbles upon a plot organized by international slave traitors.  Hong Kong action vet Cory Yuen makes The Transporter his English language directorial debut, and Statham is a more than fitting actor for the role and this is a showcase of his goods as the next big screen action hero.  The plot, while filled with leaps of logic and plenty of holes, is easily ignored once once you lay eyes on some of the best martial arts action scenes to come along in a while.

Unfortunately it's pretty much the same stuff and by choosing this one over the aforementioned you are not really going to be seeing that much better.The packaging of this movie has one or two things you should know about. First of all this is a LUC BESSON produced movie. Yeah, that's right, it is a Luc Besson presents ""The Transporter"" but is not labelled as such because most ""Luc Besson presents"" movies are really bad in plot, structure, story and dialogue in favor of big explosions and car chases. In essence, The Transporter is the exact same sort of hokum, except for Jason Statham showing us that he can do some stunts and in fairness he does them well.If you did not like ""Taxi"" then you will not like this one. If you liked Taxi then you can expect pretty much the same thing - terrible plot that is just there as a convenience to show some car chases, punch-ups and shoot outs. It was good to see Statham doing the action hero thing although he does lack a bit of charisma and the hard man side does not come through as well as it should because of various scenes that give him a heart.The plot is really full of obvious holes with totally unbelievable scenes (especially with the detective) and has something to do with a mafia dealing in slaves and Statham being double-crossed on one of his transporting jobs. Cue various set pieces involving Statham doing some stunts, beating up the bad guys and saving the day. In terms of storytelling it is a way below average for its type, but the action is not bad and at least the fun fight sequences and odd laugh help save this one from being as bad as the one star screenplay.Only watch this one if all the good rentals are out. Older teenagers or young adults will probably like it and although there is a lot of violence it is not generally bloody and is played out more as a display of martial arts and stunt work than for graphic shocks making it somewhat family entertainment on par with the latest Bond flick.",2,Another bad Luc Besson Presents....,1075939200,"02 5, 2004",2004,2105,"['expectation', 'was', 'vehicle', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'better', 'average', 'B', 'action', 'monthly', 'movie', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Seagal', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'stuff', 'choosing', 'one', 'aforementioned', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'going', 'be', 'seeing', 'much', 'packaging', 'movie', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'should', 'know', 'First', 'LUC', 'BESSON', 'produced', 'movie', 'Yeah', 'right', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'Transporter', 'not', 'labelled', 'such', 'most', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'presents', 'movies', 'are', 'really', 'bad', 'plot', 'structure', 'story', 'dialogue', 'favor', 'big', 'explosions', 'car', 'chases', 'essence', 'Transporter', 'exact', 'same', 'sort', 'hokum', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'showing', 'can', 'do', 'stunts', 'fairness', 'well.If', 'did', 'not', 'Taxi', 'then', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'one', 'liked', 'Taxi', 'then', 'can', 'expect', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'terrible', 'plot', 'just', 'there', 'convenience', 'show', 'car', 'chases', 'punch-ups', 'shoot', 'outs', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'Statham', 'doing', 'action', 'hero', 'thing', 'lack', 'bit', 'charisma', 'hard', 'man', 'side', 'not', 'come', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'various', 'scenes', 'give', 'heart.The', 'plot', 'really', 'full', 'obvious', 'holes', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'scenes', 'especially', 'detective', 'something', 'do', 'mafia', 'dealing', 'slaves', 'Statham', 'being', 'double-crossed', 'one', 'transporting', 'jobs', 'Cue', 'various', 'set', 'pieces', 'involving', 'Statham', 'doing', 'stunts', 'beating', 'up', 'bad', 'guys', 'saving', 'day', 'terms', 'storytelling', 'way', 'average', 'type', 'action', 'not', 'bad', 'least', 'fun', 'fight', 'sequences', 'odd', 'laugh', 'help', 'save', 'one', 'being', 'as', 'bad', 'one', 'star', 'screenplay.Only', 'watch', 'one', 'good', 'rentals', 'are', 'out', 'Older', 'teenagers', 'young', 'adults', 'will', 'probably', 'lot', 'violence', 'not', 'generally', 'bloody', 'played', 'out', 'more', 'display', 'martial', 'arts', 'stunt', 'work', 'graphic', 'shocks', 'making', 'somewhat', 'family', 'entertainment', 'par', 'latest', 'Bond', 'flick']","Transporter, The"

This movie had it all.I don't do a lot of reviews on Movies because I never want to give away to much, some times its better if you don't know what to expect. Like I did ((smile)) I didn't know what the HECK this movie was about my boyfriend and I saw it this weekend. He selected it because he happens to like the Producer (the dude who did Le Femme Nikita)and the Director other works (he does the Martial Arts choreography for some of Jet Li's and Jackie Chans movies). Anyway needless to say I didn't know what to expect so all I could be was either pleasantly surprised or hate it.

Plot not much kind of far fetch and not clearly pointed out but the ACTION!! this guy is incredible! The movie opens with this slamming car chase scene the music in it was the BOMB!! (very Hip-Hop) it never took a lull (in my opinion) you were on a Fast Pace ride.He is a transporter of anything.... NO QUESTIONS ASKED. He is good at what he does, precise and meticulous. Of course something happens while he doing a job and ALL HELL BREAKS loose. There is a woman Qui Shi (Japanese action fans will remember her from ""A Man called Hero"" fame) that's thrown into his world and with her comes trouble (same ole scenerio)but here is where the plot gets fuzzy and suspended belief needs to come in. You never really know if he should trust her or not and their are some stunts scenes that are again............  you need to use your suspended belief theory here in order to still enjoy the movie.

Off-screen, French directing teams (some from Ronin) created awesome cinematography and driving scenes, mixed with Yuen-driven (the credited director) hand-to-hand action scenes, all mixed with--of course--Jason Statham's fighting prowess.On-screen, Statham has a rare combination of actual acting and physical prowess.  Shu Qi is beautiful, and her character has more going on than just to be saved by Statham (some viewers apparently missed this).  There is also an apparently well-known French actor who works as a semi-friendly inspector, and he does a great job.Problems with the movie are predictable for something so action-oriented: plot holes, some impossible stunts.  It also has some unique problems, which add to the movies's charms: such as French criminals high and low speak American English (?), Statham tries to do the same (and gives up halfway, like Costner in Robin Hood but reversed), and Shu Qi and the French inspector are at times unintelligible.But at a basic level, the movie is all about Statham kicking ass, about Shu Qi looking beautiful, and lots of explosions over a sunny European seaside setting.

Jason Stratham (""The Italian Job"" and ""Snatch"") is one of the most exciting talents around and this film shows him off perfectly!Not only were the pyrotechnics great (heat-seeking missles destroying a castle-like chateau on the French shore), the hand-to-hand was brilliantly choreographed and executed. There wasn't a wire in (or out) of sight! Like Jackie Chan, Stratham uses everything within his environment as a way to win even though he's always out-numbered by the bad guys. Barrels of used oil? Great! He spills it, rolls around in it, now they can't grab him (he'd lost his shirt by then) without slipping right off! But unlike the wonderful Jackie Chan, when Strathum hits, it's pure streetfighter - you know it hurts and hurts hard. He uses brilliant tactics - not just brawn - to turn every dire moment to his advantage and ends up coming across like a real man's man, a genius at survival and winning.The opening scene amps up the tension as Stratham, a retired Army special ops officer, picks up 4 guys who have just robbed a bank of millions in bearer bonds. His contract, however, was for transporting only 3 people, and the car's shocks wouldn't handle the additional weight. He calmly tells the robbers that they've broken one of his three rules and refuses to drive. I won't spoil the rest, but suffice to say it turns into a wonderful car chase through the streets of France.His second job doesn't go so well. The ""package"" is a girl who is being hushed up so she cannot inform the police about slave trading. Stratham ends up complicating his simple life for a cause, somewhat aided by the French policeman who knows what he really does but refuses to give him a lot of grief for it when there's no real proof because he respects ex-military men.Stratham's unique blend of physicality, great voice, charm and testosterone has no equal. He deserves to be a huge star. The only reason I'm giving this movie a 4 instead of a 5 is that the climactic ending failed to live up to the quality of the beginning by just a tad. It's also not one I would watch over and over, but it's definitely worth seeing once or twice.

737553,A38VQ2TIPPBKNN,B00008AOVL,"Sir Charles Panther ""Life is hard.  It's hard...","[8, 9]","This film starts off absolutely excellently, with great pace and dialog, violence, a wicked car used immediately in a fantastic chase, good music, and a great on-location foreign setting; it's basically aBMW Film.  Then you get a little plot, some complications, and some more really good fighting and shooting action.  The opening was excellent, and I was looking forward to a great film.  But as the film went on, the holes in the plot and the continuity just got bigger and bigger, the lead actress' ability to act got weaker and weaker, and the story got more and more stupid, until by the end it was just absolute crap.  I was thrilled watching the opening, but by the end I was glad I'd not paid to see it.I'm a Statham fan, of his work with Guy Ritchie, inThe One, and cursing John Carpenter for killing him off inGhosts of Mars.  Statham is buff in the role, if a bit flat, due to his character. He's methodical, thorough, and completely professional, and it clearly applies to all aspects of his life.  Yet in all he goes through--he goes through a lot--he barely shows a trace of anger, or surprise, or anything else.Qi Shu is awful as the female lead, hollow and awkward, not knowing what to do with her arms.  She's at her best when bound and gagged early in the film.  The only time she comes off convincingly is when she's speaking Chinese.  She is grotesquely thin, and just not that attractive, as stock Asian film beauties go.I can see why this film didn't do well in the US.  It's just too Euro, with the unfamiliar French scenery, the Mediterranean architecture, the metric measurements, the too-thick French accents.  Even the Chinese actors are mushy when they utter their English.  But luckily, when it counts everyone speaks English. And the bad guy's English is excellent.Much like other action films, physics takes a holiday, with bullets penetrating 8-inch thick stone walls.  A bad guy takes an entry-and-exit shot to the head, and all it leaves is a smallish glob of brain-goop on the back window of Statham's perfectly maintained BMW.  Compare this to Vincent capping Leon in the face in ""Pulp Fiction.""The obligatory love scene is comical, in that there's nothing in the preceding 30 minutes to create any chemistry or tension between Statham and Qi Shu.  And there's no romantic follow-up of any kind, no hand-holding, no knowing/loving looks, nothing.  Awful.The plot and continuity just get worse and worse as the film goes on.  Statham jailbreaks with a hostage--cut to Statham in some beater Saab, with no police chase.  He hops in a launch called ""Cassis"" at the quay, which in the next scene has been transformed into the ""Mannon.""  My 7-year-old daughter noticed this continuity flaw; why didn't the filmmaking professionals catch it?Later, in a port the size of Marseilles, how is Statham going to find a single container full of undocumented Chinese?  With a stethoscope, naturally.  This place handles probably 10,000 containers/day, stacked in blocks 10 across, 20 deep, and 10-12 high, yet apparently he plans to listen to each one.  The flaws just accelerate.  The bad guys ignite some sort of fuel/oil in the choppy waters of the harbor with weapons fire, but the same shots fired onto an oil-covered floor do nothing, not even sparks.Granted, the fights are choreographed very well, in that Statham gets to take his shirt off a lot, and his moves are the coolest, strongest, most acrobatic, etc.  The bad guys, who at one point outnumber him something like 9 to 1, come at him singly, each politely waiting their turn to get punched senseless.  He beats and belts, but doesn't kill any of the bad guys who after all are all out to kill him (what about the two hapless cops in the trunk of his blown-up BMW?).  Statham goes down only once, right when the plot needs him to, with a single kick delivered by a little guy whom Statham punched the living hell out of earlier in the film.  Weak.The final chase is an action-packed joke.  Statham parachutes from a crop duster (where did that sport chute come from?) onto a truck moving at probably 60 mph.  The bad guy appears on the opposite side of the truck from where his vehicle was less than 20 seconds earlier.  Throughout the chase, there are two containers full of Chinese immigrants in the convoy, but Statham saves only one.  Where did the other one go, with its assumed slavery-bound immigrants inside?  And when they open the container up, it's not absolutely packed with people, but is only about 1/3 full, and there's no dead bodies in there, no piles of trash, no filth, no wretched urchins half-dead from 20 days locked inside a tossing metal box.  Instead, a delightful and cuddly little Chinese child wanders out of the darkness for a loving hug from the wooden Qi Shu.  Barf.At times, the highly original Stanley Clarke-of whom I am a huge fan-soundtrack just wasn't matched to the film, its pace, mood, or scenes.  There were a couple of times when really pounding hip-hop rap was playing, loud, over a fight scene or chase taking place in the south of France.  That's just too forced, trying too hard, a sad ploy to be too cool, to appeal to one demographic too many.  The soundtrack also was just too intrusive at times, taking over the action itself.  This reflects poor post-production.In conclusion, go ahead and watch, don't ask too many questions, and try to avoid paying for the experience.  You'll get a fantastic opening, some good stunts and cool fighting, but characters and a story that unravel faster than the speed limit on the southern French autoroute.",3,"A Fantastic Start, An

If you keep that in mind and don't try to nit-pick it, you'll enjoy it much more.  It's meant to be fast, furious and outrageous.  It's the perfect antidote to boredom.Jason Statham is a rising star.  I've seen his limited role in Snatch, but he gets to take his career to a whole new level as The Transporter.  He's refreshing to watch with his cool, collected British manner.  This movie would have been a complete flop without him.  After countless Van-Damme and Segal flops in the last decade, Statham is the new action hero to cheer for (don't get me started on Vin Diesel).The film is beautifully filmed on the south coast of France (a nice change from the streets of L.A.).  A primitive musical score tries to keep the action alive.  And, Wow!  What action!  Stratham demonstrates his kick-boxing talents and makes mush out of anyone who crosses him.  But it's the suave, Bond-esque manner in which his character conducts his ""business"" that makes this a really cool flick.The movie has logical flaws and exaggerations.  I mean, lots of them.  But I reserve my critical judgment for more serious films.  Thankfully,  Luc Besson has left this one open-ended and ripe for a sequel.

737558,A3AA3OZJPJCDHF,B00008AOVL,Stephen Fink,"[2, 4]","In The Transporter, Jason Statham (Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels/ Snatch/ The One) proves he can handle the action star persona that Vin Diesel isn't quite up to, even if the movie he displays it in ain't so hot. The most disturbing problem (and by disturbing, I mean it irritates ever other second) with The Transporter is it's poorly constructed soundtrack. During the action sequences it attempts to implement off genre songs (in hope of irony, maybe?), as done in Office Space or Sexy Beast, but it doesn't work well in this setting. The most despicable part of the soundtrack, however, is the overly dramatic mood music used during the ""emotional"" scenes. This is about enough to make you want to throw popcorn at the screen. That brings me to another problem with the film: namely it's alternation between ""emotional"" and action sequences, with no real story to drive either of them (not that the action needs a story, it does fine without one here). I can see what the director was aiming for, only showing you things from the perspective of the main character--who doesn't know the story himself--but the practice of this idea doesn't play very well. Still, this is an action movie, and thus, delivers better in that area than any other this year (though The Bourne Identity is a better film overall). The chase scene in the beginning is nothing short of stunning in every imaginable aspect and the fight scenes (especially the one involving oil) are brilliantly choreographed and directed.

However, this, the original was good fun to watch when it was released and keeps its legs these many years after.  Since summaries and evaluations of plots, acting, stunts et al have been included in almost every review, this review will focus only upon the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray.VIDEO....The video transfer, while clearly not remastered for Blu Ray but only encoded, provided surprisingly good imaging.  The color grading starts warmly and becomes quite natural in appearance soon after with good skin tones, decent blacks and good contrast.  Some small details are obviously lost and clearly seen in scenes taking place in the forest or fields as they tend to have a touch of blur in them.  Mbps rate stays steady in the low twenties and, especially on background walls and such, you can easily view the slight grain that is present.  This video noise was not distracting in any way and I saw no artifacting or stair stepping in any of the scenes, especially the chase scenes where stair stepping and aliasing would be more observable.AUDIO....The DTS HD MA 5.1 audio transfer is quite good, not perfect, in its clear and transparent dialogue and is consistent in its audio levels.  The surround speakers, both front and rear, are used throughout the film for both foley fx and the music surround which really makes some demands on your LFE channel.  My only real complaint is that, often, the musical score literally drowns out the action and subsequently, the foley fx.  My guess is that this is by design but not one I would endorse.  For the music score there is excellent separation across the stereo field, but, as I said, I would rather hear the action than the music which serves to pump up the action scenes taking place.EXTRAS...There is a single commentary with Jason Stratham but no others unless you want to count the 9 preview trailers for more old films.  I really do hate these as they force you to buy the companies advertising when you only want to pay for the movie itself and any related to the film extras.  These 9 previews take up plenty of disc space that could have gone to less compression of the feature film you bought resulting in better imaging.I do hope that this review, which focused solely upon the quality of the actual transfer to Blu Ray has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase. All of my reviews are of this nature and I hope they can be of HELP to you as well.Thanks for reading.",4,The Transporter [Blu-ray],1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,2563,"['Have', ""n't"", 'seen', '3rd', 'sequel', 'second', 'was', 'totally', 'absurd', 'fake', 'looking', 'effects', 'unrealistic', 'stunts', 'However', 'original', 'was', 'good', 'fun', 'watch', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'legs', 'many', 'years', 'summaries', 'evaluations', 'plots', 'acting', 'stunts', 'et', 'al', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'almost', 'review', 'review', 'will', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray.VIDEO', '.The', 'video', 'transfer', 'clearly', 'not', 'remastered', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'only', 'encoded', 'provided', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'imaging', 'color', 'grading', 'warmly', 'quite', 'natural', 'appearance', 'soon', 'good', 'skin', 'tones', 'decent', 'blacks', 'good', 'contrast', 'small', 'details', 'are', 'obviously', 'lost', 'clearly', 'seen', 'scenes', 'taking', 'place', 'forest', 'fields', 'tend', 'have', 'touch', 'blur', 'Mbps', 'rate', 'stays', 'steady', 'low', 'twenties', 'especially', 'background', 'walls', 'such', 'can', 'easily', 'view', 'slight', 'grain', 'present', 'video', 'noise', 'was', 'not', 'distracting', 'way', 'saw', 'artifacting', 'stair', 'stepping', 'scenes', 'especially', 'chase', 'where', 'stair', 'stepping', 'aliasing', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'observable.AUDIO', '.The', 'DTS', 'HD', 'MA', '5.1', 'audio', 'transfer', 'quite', 'good', 'not', 'perfect', 'clear', 'transparent', 'dialogue', 'consistent', 'audio', 'levels', 'surround', 'speakers', 'front', 'rear', 'are', 'used', 'film', 'foley', 'fx', 'music', 'surround', 'really', 'demands', 'LFE', 'channel', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'often', 'musical', 'score', 'literally', 'out', 'action', 'subsequently', 'foley', 'fx', 'guess', 'design', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'endorse', 'music', 'score', 'excellent', 'separation', 'stereo', 'field', 'said', 'would', 'rather', 'hear', 'action', 'music', 'pump', 'up', 'action', 'scenes', 'taking', 'place.EXTRAS', 'single', 'commentary', 'Jason', 'Stratham', 'others', 'want', 'count', '9', 'preview', 'trailers', 'more', 'old', 'films', 'really', 'do', 'hate', 'force', 'buy', 'companies', 'advertising', 'when', 'only', 'want', 'pay', 'movie', 'related', 'film', 'extras', '9', 'previews', 'take', 'up', 'plenty', 'disc', 'space', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'less', 'compression', 'feature', 'film', 'bought', 'resulting', 'better', 'imaging.I', 'do', 'hope', 'review', 'focused', 'solely', 'quality', 'actual', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'been', 'help', 'deciding', 'purchase', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'hope', 'can', 'be', 'HELP', 'well.Thanks', 'reading']","Transporter, The"

737568,A3863M2049OPN3,B00008AOVL,The Bus,"[0, 1]","I was extremely disapointed at this movie. The first ten minutes set up the story. The ""transporter"" transports things from one location to another. Whatever you need moved, he will take it, no questions asked, and get it to where it needs to go, no matter what. That's the deal. The first ten minutes contained one of the coolest car chases I've ever seen. I was sure the movie would be excellent. Sounds kind of cool right? Wrong. It went downhill from there, in a hurry.Somewhere in this movie there was a plot. In one scene, there would be a great deal of plot involved, and in others the plot seemed to be forgotten.There are some movies that can make up for not having a good plot by having good action. This one doesn't fall in that category either.By far the coolest parts in this movie are highlighted in the commercials. The car chase scene is from the beginning, the rockets blowing up his house, the fight in the mansion where he does that awesome double kick (and where he rings the doorbell and then kicks the door down), the fight scene in the bus station where everybody gets covered with greese, and the chase at the end where he kicks through the windshield of a moving semi truck. That's what they show in the commercial, and that's the only cool parts.No surprises here. If you liked ""kiss of the dragon"", with Jet Li, then you'll probably like this one. If you thought ""KOD"" had a stupid story, and didn't have as much action as you thought it would, then you'd definitely not like The Transporter.It was a good try. It had a lot of potential, but this one will definitely gather dust when it comes out to rent. Go only if you can get somebody else to pay for your ticket.

Frank, the star of our movie is a ""transporter"" that is, a driver.  A driver for robberies and a driver that delivered packages, no questions asked.  Our man is hired to deliver a package that is loaded into the truck of his car.  When he gets a flat, he sees that the package is moving.  He instantly knows what it is, it is a person.  He breaks his own rule and looks into the package and sees a pretty young woman.  But, being a man of business he delivers the package to its destination anyway.  Where he is asked to transport another package.  Little does he know his knew package is a bomb, designed to take him out of the equation, leaving no witnesses to his delivery.  He goes back to exact his vengeance and steal car similar to the one they blew up on him.  He takes the young woman back to his place to try and figure out what to do.Before he can figure out his options his home is destroyed in a second attempt on his life.  Once again, Frank escapes.  Once again, against his judgement he decides to get involved and realizes quickly he is in deep.  He finds out that the bad guys are smuggling illegals from the far east.  With the help of a local police chief he starts his campaign.  Lots of action in this moving, car chases, explosions, guns, martial arts but without the goofy one liners that many of the newer movies have.  Frank is a quiet ex-military man who always gets the job done.  And once again, he gets the job done.This is an action packed movie that never crosses into the unrealistic.

Unrealistic, but more importantly poorly constructed, this gauche thriller only succeeds in being unintentionally hilarious - which oddly adds entertainment value the creators couldn't have planned for.Frank (Jason Statham) only has three rules for transporting: 1. Never change the deal; 2. No names; 3. Never open the package. For the right price and proper dimensions he'll get the job done, no questions asked. And his ex-military skills ensure that his getaways are clean - and look good. Although he's not unaccustomed to breaking the law and aiding criminals, Frank has morals that betray the often iniquitous business of professional transportation.So when Wall Street (Matt Schulze - going along with the no names policy, apparently, several of the characters are only given generic monikers in the credits) hires him to transport a package that turns out to be the bound and gagged young Asian woman Lai (Shu Qi), his mixed feelings get him involved in helping her uncover a smuggling operation run by gangsters who will stop at nothing to see him dead.Frank is prepared for every single situation, which makes his careful pre-planning more than convenient. Scuba gear for a hasty underwater escape and the knowledge of truck routes for following enemy vehicles are the least of his uncanny abilities. Every scene is merely a setup to get from one stunt location to the next, and it doesn't take long for the viewer to realize that Frank's constant unlikely reappearances are beyond good luck. During his journey from jail to office buildings to bus yards, he's accompanied by irksome music that makes each coincidence noticeably more intentional.The action itself is frequently amusing, with excellent choreography and riveting stunts, especially when he kicks down doors to get to baddies, fends off axe attacks, and slickly maneuvers in massive oil fights. Frank likes to lose his shirt during every other scene, volley with Shu Qi's laughable dialogue, and deflect rockets with cookie trays (a scene in the trailer that never made it to the theatrical cut). Statham's not the typical action star, but he has a certain intrigue all of his own. What he lacks is the silly and catchy one-liners that usually plague these kinds of generic action films - for which there are countless moments that they could have been aptly applied.In the tradition of cheesy action flicks, The Transporter's car chases, martial arts and stunts are quite enjoyable; plus there's a delightfully witty show-stealing performance by police inspector Tarconi (Francois Berleand) - if only that annoying storyline didn't keep popping up. But maybe that's expected from director Corey Yuen, recognized for his martial arts choreography on X-Men and Lethal Weapon 4.- Mike Massie",3,The Transporter Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1227571200,"11 25, 2008",2008,2925,"['Transporter', 'tries', 'be', 'thrilling', 'James', 'Bond-like', 'adventure', 'ultimately', 'out', 'be', 'prime', 'material', 'episode', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'Unrealistic', 'more', 'importantly', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'gauche', 'only', 'being', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'oddly', 'entertainment', 'value', 'creators', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'planned', 'for.Frank', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'only', 'three', 'rules', 'transporting', '1', 'change', 'deal', '2', 'names', '3', 'Never', 'open', 'package', 'right', 'price', 'proper', 'dimensions', ""'ll"", 'get', 'job', 'done', 'questions', 'asked', 'ex-military', 'skills', 'ensure', 'getaways', 'are', 'clean', 'look', 'good', 'not', 'unaccustomed', 'breaking', 'law', 'aiding', 'criminals', 'Frank', 'morals', 'betray', 'often', 'iniquitous', 'business', 'professional', 'transportation.So', 'when', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Matt', 'Schulze', 'going', 'names', 'policy', 'apparently', 'several', 'characters', 'are', 'only', 'given', 'generic', 'monikers', 'credits', 'transport', 'package', 'out', 'be', 'bound', 'gagged', 'young', 'Asian', 'woman', 'Lai', 'Shu', 'Qi', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'get', 'involved', 'helping', 'uncover', 'smuggling', 'operation', 'run', 'gangsters', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'see', 'dead.Frank', 'prepared', 'single', 'situation', 'careful', 'pre-planning', 'more', 'convenient', 'Scuba', 'gear', 'hasty', 'underwater', 'escape', 'knowledge', 'truck', 'routes', 'following', 'enemy', 'vehicles', 'are', 'least', 'uncanny', 'abilities', 'scene', 'merely', 'setup', 'get', 'one', 'stunt', 'location', 'next', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'viewer', 'realize', 'Frank', 'constant', 'unlikely', 'reappearances', 'are', 'good', 'luck', 'journey', 'jail', 'office', 'buildings', 'bus', 'yards', 'accompanied', 'irksome', 'music', 'coincidence', 'noticeably', 'more', 'intentional.The', 'action', 'frequently', 'amusing', 'excellent', 'choreography', 'riveting', 'stunts', 'especially', 'when', 'down', 'doors', 'get', 'baddies', 'axe', 'attacks', 'slickly', 'maneuvers', 'massive', 'oil', 'fights', 'Frank', 'lose', 'shirt', 'other', 'scene', 'volley', 'Shu', 'Qi', 'laughable', 'dialogue', 'deflect', 'rockets', 'cookie', 'trays', 'scene', 'trailer', 'never', 'made', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'Statham', 'not', 'typical', 'action', 'star', 'certain', 'intrigue', 'own', 'What', 'silly', 'catchy', 'one-liners', 'usually', 'plague', 'kinds', 'generic', 'action', 'films', 'are', 'countless', 'moments', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'aptly', 'tradition', 'cheesy', 'action', 'flicks', 'Transporter', 'car', 'chases', 'martial', 'arts', 'stunts', 'are', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'delightfully', 'witty', 'show-stealing', 'performance', 'police', 'inspector', 'Tarconi', 'Francois', 'Berleand', 'only', 'annoying', 'storyline', 'did', ""n't"", 'keep', 'popping', 'up', 'maybe', 'expected', 'director', 'Corey', 'Yuen', 'recognized', 'martial', 'arts', 'choreography', 'X-Men', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', '4.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']","Transporter, The"

737572,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B00008AOVL,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[6, 7]","Movie - 4.0The first time I saw Jason Statham was in The One. I certainly didn't think too much of him at the time because of his character's unstable British/Brooklyn hybrid accent and the lack of action he got in comparison to Jet Li and.. the other Jet Li, and I had no idea he'd transform into the kind of action star he turned out to be afterward. Then came The Transporter, a Eurasian concoction of film-making helmed by great French director Luc Besson and soon-to-be prot&eacute;g&eacute;s Louis Leterrier and Pierre Morel and choreographed by long-time Hong Kong veteran Cory Yuen, who coincidentally worked with Li (in addition to at least half his other movies) and Statham (for the first time ever) in The One. Whoever came up with the idea to bring Yuen into these movies did a great job. Shallow and simple plot aside, The Transporter and its sequels have never been about the story, but about Frank Martin kicking butt and driving a fast car. The Transporter series is one of my favorite guilty pleasures of escapist entertainment because of the sheer style that accompanies the character of Frank Martin and his exotic adventures. He's calm, collected, where's a snazzy suit, performs some very elegant martial arts moves for a buff British guy, and looks cool doing it all at the same time. It's almost like James Bond and the whole ""deadly and debonair gentleman"" theme, but without all the espionage, gadgets, and actual attempt at developing a story. In fact, after watching this again just recently I have to say the action and driving sequences become more and more appreciable every time I see them. If not for the PG-13 rating, G.I. Joe-esque ""laser bullets,"" and occasional moments of cheese and campiness, I'd probably be so bold as to consider this ""quintessential"" for action junkies. However, I think part of the overall fun is its B-movie-ness and its ability to not be taken as seriously as other films in the genre.Video - 3.5Presented by Fox in 1080p at an original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 using the now-outdated MPEG-2 codec The Transporter looks pretty decent, all things considered. Colors are vibrant with a reddish tint to skin tones, and film-grain has its fair share of screen time as well throughout a majority of the movie. Detail and textures are relatively fine, though close ups varied between ""somewhat crisp"" and ""really smudgy."" Perhaps more disc space or a more advanced video codec could've made for better sharpness and higher bit rates. Black levels and contrast are better than the SD-DVD, but again, being one of the initial BD releases before all the studios got the hang of encoding, much is left to be desired. Artifacts and debris are also present, though it's actually less than what I expected, especially in comparison to other transfers I've seen produced on more recent films.Audio - 4.5Although the video is just sub-par, the DTS-HD 5.1 track more than makes up for it. From the very beginning where Frank drives his BMW 735 around Paris we're immersed into the world of The Transporter with a very healthy dose of bass from Stanley Clarke's popping score and a mix of various car, crash, tumble, and clicking sound effects from the chase. Action sequences involving weaponry and fisticuffs do a good job sweeping between the high and low ends, with automatic weapons and crunching sounds being most prominent. Dialogue is clear and legible outside of all the thick accents from the actors and separation of music and sound effects is excellent. The only quality keeping me from calling this a reference track is the somewhat subdued LFE levels. They seem to be more accentuated by the music rather than the action itself, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it takes out just enough oomph to make this worth showcasing. Fortunately, though, the sequels fix that.Extras - 1.0Aside from trailers, there's only a commentary track featuring Statham and producer Steven Chasman. It would've been nice to see an interview by Luc Besson or maybe a vignette about the martial arts or driving choreography...Overall - 3.5The Transporter is full of testosterone and oozes cool all over the place. For me, it's also the beginning of what would become a pretty good action career for the actor formerly known as the character Bacon. He definitely has what it takes to be that sort of in-your-face, do-it-all action hero. And while the general opinion may be to call this a popcorn movie, I'd actually disagree and say pay more attention to the ""craft"" of the movie itself. The martial arts, stunt driving, music, and cinematography, while not part of a spectacular story, are actually very well-coordinated by some very talented people. With decent video quality and an excellent lossless track, action fans would do well to break Frank Martin's Rule #3 and take a look at this package.",4,The Transporter (Blu-ray),1277164800,"06 22,

737573,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00008AOVL,trebe,"[0, 1]","Jason Statham's career has enjoyed a meteoric rise.  The Transporter (2002) was the first film to feature the rugged Brit in a lead role, and provided the opportunity for him to showcase his skills as a martial artist, and former professional driver.  Co-directed by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans), and with Cory Yuen focusing on the action scenes, the film is a slick and flashy affair, that's low on reality, and high on stylized action.  Co-written by noted French filmmaker Luc Besson (Le Femme Nikita, The Professional), the film is set in France, and features Statham as Frank Martin, a professional driver, who transports items from one destination to another, for a fee.  Martin lives by his own set of rules, but life gets complicated, when one of his packages turns out to be a beautiful Chinese girl named Lai Kwai (Qi Shu), and his customer named Wall Street (Matt Schultze), decides that the Transporter should be eliminated.Although the film's premise is paper thin, things are played completely straight.  Setting reality aside, and going along for the ride, is not that hard to do.  The action is fast and furious, and Statham has an uber-masculine screen presence, that can be overpowering.Frank and Lai end up together, after Martin makes a retaliatory strike at Wall Street's mansion, that leaves the place in shambles.  Wall Street is working with Lai's father, Mr. Kwai (Ric Young), in smuggling human cargo, and is determined to obliterate the Transporter.  Complicating matters, is coffee craving police Inspector Tarconi (Francois Berleand), who keeps poking his nose into Martin's affairs.Corey Yuen includes several impressive Hong Kong style fight sequences, one in a bus garage, inside a bus, and another exquisitely executed ballet, battling in a pool of oil.  Somehow degreasing himself, Martin then parachutes onto a truck with the prisoners, taking it on a mad ride to the finish.  Throughout the film, the action is tempered by Martin's deliberate effort to avoid killing, unless absolutely necessary, resulting in a ton of leg wounds.  At the time, co-star Qi Shu was trying to learn to speak English.  She proved to be capable actress, and a quick learner, as she handles the dialog well enough, and has decent chemistry with Statham.At this point, films like Death Race, the Crank films, and two Transporter sequels, have made Jason Statham, the foremost exponent of this kind of frenetic, over the edge, action thriller.  As he continues to expands his range, and hone his acting skills, the upside for Statham's film career, appears to be nowhere in sight.",3,"breaking the rules, in Statham's breakout role . . .",1272067200,"04 24, 2010",2010,2601,"['Jason', 'Statham', 'career', 'enjoyed', 'meteoric', 'rise', 'Transporter', '2002', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'feature', 'rugged', 'Brit', 'lead', 'role', 'provided', 'opportunity', 'showcase', 'skills', 'martial', 'artist', 'former', 'professional', 'driver', 'Co-directed', 'Louis', 'Leterrier', 'Clash', 'Titans', 'Cory', 'Yuen', 'focusing', 'action', 'scenes', 'film', 'slick', 'flashy', 'affair', 'low', 'reality', 'high', 'stylized', 'action', 'Co-written', 'noted', 'French', 'filmmaker', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'Le', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'Professional', 'film', 'set', 'France', 'features', 'Statham', 'Frank', 'Martin', 'professional', 'driver', 'who', 'items', 'one', 'destination', 'fee', 'Martin', 'own', 'set', 'rules', 'life', 'complicated', 'when', 'one', 'packages', 'out', 'be', 'beautiful', 'Chinese', 'girl', 'named', 'Lai', 'Kwai', 'Qi', 'Shu', 'customer', 'named', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Matt', 'Schultze', 'Transporter', 'should', 'be', 'film', 'premise', 'paper', 'thin', 'things', 'are', 'played', 'completely', 'straight', 'Setting', 'reality', 'aside', 'going', 'along', 'ride', 'not', 'that', 'hard', 'do', 'action', 'fast', 'furious', 'Statham', 'uber-masculine', 'screen', 'presence', 'can', 'be', 'overpowering.Frank', 'Lai', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'Martin', 'retaliatory', 'strike', 'Wall', 'Street', 'mansion', 'place', 'shambles', 'Wall', 'Street', 'working', 'Lai', 'father', 'Mr.', 'Kwai', 'Ric', 'Young', 'smuggling', 'human', 'cargo', 'determined', 'obliterate', 'Transporter', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'coffee', 'craving', 'police', 'Inspector', 'Tarconi', 'Francois', 'Berleand', 'who', 'poking', 'nose', 'Martin', 'affairs.Corey', 'Yuen', 'several', 'impressive', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'style', 'fight', 'sequences', 'one', 'bus', 'garage', 'bus', 'exquisitely', 'executed', 'ballet', 'battling', 'pool', 'oil', 'Somehow', 'degreasing', 'Martin', 'then', 'truck', 'prisoners', 'taking', 'mad', 'ride', 'finish', 'film', 'action', 'tempered', 'Martin', 'deliberate', 'effort', 'avoid', 'killing', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'resulting', 'ton', 'leg', 'wounds', 'time', 'co-star', 'Qi', 'Shu', 'was', 'trying', 'learn', 'speak', 'English', 'proved', 'be', 'capable', 'actress', 'quick', 'learner', 'dialog', 'well', 'enough', 'decent', 'chemistry', 'Statham.At', 'point', 'films', 'Death', 'Race', 'Crank', 'films', 'two', 'Transporter', 'sequels', 'have', 'made', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'foremost', 'exponent', 'kind', 'frenetic', 'edge', 'action', 'thriller', 'expands', 'range', 'hone', 'acting', 'skills', 'upside', 'Statham', 'film', 'career', 'be', 'nowhere', 'sight']","Transporter, The"

It seems it goes in streaks where there are definitive stars for periods of time, but lately it seems we've been introduced to many of them (i.e. Vin Diesel and now Statham).  The Transporter is the movie that will give Statham his much needed exposure.For the movie itself, it was a step above the average action flick.  The action sequences were incredible, and something we don't see in every action movie.  There were a few scenes that I said &quot;that's impossible&quot;, but who cares.  I'm not watching to see real life.The first 30 minutes were wonderful, with the opening car chase being the kicker.  It was one of the better ones I've seen in a long time.  Everything just unfolded very well, but the movie eventually slowed down to develop some plot, and it sort of brought the movie down.The directing was smooth and had good editing.  The music was a breath of fresh air.  It just seemed refreshing and new, and it definitely added to the movie positively.The Transporter is a good film if you're looking for terrific action, not for a movie high on plot.  4 Stars",4,Transported Action Star,1054598400,"06 3, 2003",2003,1135,"['Jason', 'Statham', 'next', 'big', 'action', 'star', 'Hollywood', 'streaks', 'where', 'are', 'definitive', 'stars', 'periods', 'time', 'lately', ""'ve"", 'been', 'introduced', 'many', 'i.e', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'now', 'Statham', 'Transporter', 'movie', 'will', 'give', 'Statham', 'much', 'needed', 'exposure.For', 'movie', 'was', 'step', 'average', 'action', 'flick', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'incredible', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'action', 'movie', 'were', 'few', 'scenes', 'said', 'quot', 'impossible', 'quot', 'who', ""'m"", 'not', 'watching', 'see', 'real', 'life.The', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'were', 'wonderful', 'opening', 'car', 'chase', 'being', 'kicker', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'Everything', 'just', 'unfolded', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'eventually', 'slowed', 'down', 'develop', 'plot', 'sort', 'brought', 'movie', 'down.The', 'directing', 'was', 'smooth', 'had', 'good', 'editing', 'music', 'was', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'just', 'seemed', 'refreshing', 'new', 'definitely', 'added', 'movie', 'positively.The', 'Transporter', 'good', 'film', ""'re"", 'looking', 'terrific', 'action', 'not', 'movie', 'high', 'plot', '4', 'Stars']","Transporter, The"

It has all the essential elements of a testosterone charged flick: car chases, guns, damsel in distress, explosions, and marshal arts. This all wrapped around a weak plot about smuggling Chinese slaves into France. Jason Statham is in the lead role as the transporter, a ex-military guy making a living transporting packages for dubious individuals. All is good until he breaks one of his golden rules about never looking in the package. When he does, he finds Asian beauty Qi Shu. She eventually helps to persuade him to join her cause and free the smuggled slaves. As I said though, the plot is more of an excuse for the action. The movie itself is fun and reminiscent of a Hong Kong style action flick. I'm sure that was the intent of director Corey Yuen, a veteran of HK action movies. Luc Besson (The Fifth Element, The Professional) adds to the talent serving as co-writer and co-producer.The disc contains both widescreen and full screen version of the film in dolby 5.1. The picture looks great.  The sound is pretty good, but I did think the bass track should have been a little more pronounced, particularly during the many explosions. Maybe I'm being too picky here. The extras include some extended action sequences. They are unfinished, but do include an interesting commentary track from Statham and producer Steven Chasman. There's also a making of feature.No doubt about it, the Transporter is an action junkie's movie. Guys will definitely enjoy it, and it is a worthy addition to your action film library.
