551304,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B00004TX5H,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[1, 1]","""Bear in the Big Blue House"" is a wonderful holiday special featuring your favorite friends at the Big Blue House, some returning guests and a brand-new character. In this special, ""A Berry Bear Christmas,"" Bear and his friends celebrate Christmas, but also examine Hanukah and Kwanzaa. They also participate in Bear's favorite winter tradition --- the search for the winterberry and learn about the true spirit of the holidays.Things start out with everyone wanting to be involved in the decorating and everyone wanting lots of presents. But then they hear a howl and take in an old dog called Jack who doesn't have a home. They vow to give him his best holiday celebration ever and learn that there's more about the holidays than just presents and such. Some may feel that this is PC nonsense, but like anything else in the Big Blue House, this issue is handled with sensitivity and class. They really did a great job.This special is packed with wonderful holiday songs of all types. ""That's All I Want for Christmas"" is an over-the-top hoot, in which ""Santa Hogg"" is piled with the children's Christmas wishes --- all the way up to a hundred trillion clams for Pip and Pop. On the very opposite end is ""What If?"" in which Tutter speculates what it would be like if he and his friends didn't have the Big Blue House to live in.My main complaint with this production is how it's packaged and the quality of the tape. Things seem well enough, with Hi-Fi sound and close-captioning. There are also previews in the beginning for ""The Trumpet and the Swan,"" ""Dragon Tales"" (on VHS and DVD) and other ""Bear in the Big Blue House"" VHS releases. But this release is recorded in SLP mode, rather than SP, which really degrades the quality, especially upon repeat viewings. Additionally, there is editing --- this was originally a two-part special aired with two separate end-credit sequences and it's been edited into one continuous special. Finally, this video contains the standard ""Bear in the Big Blue House"" VHS boilerplate about ""Each show also includes the following songs: Welcome to the Blue House and Goodbye Song."" However, ""Welcome to the Blue House"" is not in this special, as it's replaced in favor of the holiday opening --- ""A Berry Bear Christmas."" The ""Goodbye Song"" is only performed once, at the very end, due to the editing.I gave this four stars. It's really more like three-and-a-half and I could have easily chosen three, but I'm in a holiday mood.",4,"Great Holiday Special, VHS Presentation Leaves Something to be Desired",1135468800,"12 25, 2005",2005,2465,"['Bear', 'Big', 'Blue', 'House', 'wonderful', 'holiday', 'special', 'featuring', 'favorite', 'friends', 'Big', 'Blue', 'House', 'returning', 'guests', 'brand-new', 'character', 'special', 'Berry', 'Bear', 'Christmas', 'Bear', 'friends', 'celebrate', 'Christmas', 'also', 'examine', 'Hanukah', 'Kwanzaa', 'also', 'participate', 'Bear', 'favorite', 'winter', 'tradition', 'search', 'winterberry', 'learn', 'true', 'spirit', 'holidays.Things', 'start', 'out', 'everyone', 'wanting', 'be', 'involved', 'decorating', 'everyone', 'wanting', 'lots', 'presents', 'then', 'hear', 'howl', 'take', 'old', 'dog', 'called', 'Jack', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'home', 'vow', 'give', 'best', 'holiday', 'celebration', 'ever', 'learn', 'more', 'holidays', 'just', 'presents', 'such', 'may', 'feel', 'PC', 'nonsense', 'anything', 'else', 'Big', 'Blue', 'House', 'issue', 'handled', 'sensitivity', 'class', 'really', 'did', 'great', 'job.This', 'special', 'packed', 'wonderful', 'holiday', 'songs', 'types', 'Want', 'Christmas', 'over-the-top', 'hoot', 'Santa', 'Hogg', 'piled', 'children', 'Christmas', 'wishes', 'way', 'up', 'hundred', 'trillion', 'clams', 'Pip', 'Pop', 'very', 'opposite', 'end', 'What', 'Tutter', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'friends', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Big', 'Blue', 'House', 'live', 'in.My', 'main', 'complaint', 'production', 'how', 'packaged', 'quality', 'tape', 'Things', 'seem', 'well', 'enough', 'Hi-Fi', 'sound', 'close-captioning', 'are', 'also', 'previews', 'beginning', 'Trumpet', 'Swan', 'Dragon', 'Tales', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'other', 'Bear', 'Big', 'Blue', 'House', 'VHS', 'release', 'recorded', 'SLP', 'mode', 'rather', 'SP', 'really', 'quality', 'especially', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'Additionally', 'editing', 'was', 'originally', 'two-part', 'special', 'aired', 'two', 'separate', 'end-credit', 'sequences', 'been', 'edited', 'one', 'continuous', 'special', 'Finally', 'video', 'standard', 'Bear', 'Big', 'Blue', 'House', 'VHS', 'boilerplate', 'show', 'also', 'following', 'songs', 'Welcome', 'Blue', 'House', 'Goodbye', 'Song', 'However', 'Welcome', 'Blue', 'House', 'not', 'special', 'replaced', 'favor', 'holiday', 'opening', 'Berry', 'Bear', 'Christmas', 'Goodbye', 'Song', 'only', 'performed', 'once', 'very', 'end', 'due', 'editing.I', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'really', 'more', 'three-and-a-half', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'chosen', 'three', ""'m"", 'holiday', 'mood']",N/A
