804209,A2H5XAK39RONEL,B0001GF2JM,"Algonquin ""Chief""","[7, 7]","This is a brand new 7 doing their number or so the poster said. According to the United Artists Pressbook this is not a true sequel to the three preceding films. Instead it is a tale of a brand new Seven rooted to themes and traditions that the earlier films embraced. That same United Artists Pressbook also pointed out that this film contained a very original and innovative story while not abandoning the thematic idea of seven gunmen coming to the rescue of the downtrodden. Chris is the main character of this film and the entire story revolves around him rather than the seven as a cohesive force. Chris, portrayed by a very engaging Lee Van Cleef, is an ex-gunman turned town marshal and now married. Where all three previous films opened with a protracted conflict affecting the lives of poor Mexican farmers, this film has no apparent immediate danger that would draw Chris into and away from his current lifestyle. Needless to say, that changes dramatically. This film really caries no formula recognizable from THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN but approaches the conflict with a bandit hoard quite differently. The conflict, the motivations and the stakes are all different. This film lacks the grandeur or depth of its predecessors and plays out acts of violence for effect rather than substance. Elmer Bernstein apparently assembled a much smaller orchestra perhaps feeling a need to bid farewell to the Seven with a whimper rather than imply some majestic idealism as the sun was setting fast on day of the Western.",4,Brand New 7 Doing Their Number,1165363200,"12 6, 2006",2006,1518,"['brand', 'new', '7', 'doing', 'number', 'so', 'poster', 'said', 'According', 'United', 'Artists', 'Pressbook', 'not', 'true', 'sequel', 'three', 'preceding', 'films', 'Instead', 'tale', 'brand', 'new', 'Seven', 'rooted', 'themes', 'traditions', 'earlier', 'films', 'embraced', 'same', 'United', 'Artists', 'Pressbook', 'also', 'pointed', 'out', 'film', 'contained', 'very', 'original', 'innovative', 'story', 'not', 'abandoning', 'thematic', 'idea', 'seven', 'gunmen', 'coming', 'rescue', 'downtrodden', 'Chris', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'entire', 'story', 'revolves', 'rather', 'seven', 'cohesive', 'force', 'Chris', 'portrayed', 'very', 'engaging', 'Lee', 'Van', 'Cleef', 'ex-gunman', 'turned', 'town', 'marshal', 'now', 'married', 'Where', 'three', 'previous', 'films', 'opened', 'protracted', 'conflict', 'affecting', 'lives', 'poor', 'Mexican', 'farmers', 'film', 'apparent', 'immediate', 'danger', 'would', 'draw', 'Chris', 'away', 'current', 'lifestyle', 'Needless', 'say', 'changes', 'dramatically', 'film', 'really', 'formula', 'recognizable', 'THE', 'MAGNIFICENT', 'SEVEN', 'conflict', 'bandit', 'hoard', 'quite', 'differently', 'conflict', 'motivations', 'stakes', 'are', 'different', 'film', 'grandeur', 'depth', 'predecessors', 'out', 'acts', 'violence', 'effect', 'rather', 'substance', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'apparently', 'assembled', 'much', 'smaller', 'orchestra', 'perhaps', 'feeling', 'need', 'bid', 'farewell', 'Seven', 'whimper', 'rather', 'imply', 'majestic', 'idealism', 'sun', 'was', 'setting', 'fast', 'day', 'Western']",The Magnificent Seven Ride

And the astounding thing happened: the movie turned out to be by far the best sequel of the series. I was very pleasantly surprised, thanks to Lee Van Cleef who could almost stand toe-to-toe with Yul Brynner. He really made the film, and he was very good, even for a film that was a fourth part; a very tough feat to pull off. Probably what really helped The Magnificent Seven Ride the most, for the first time ever, was that the cast was perfectly assembled. Not a single actor looked out of the part; thus, they were all natural and looked every bit of the character. The story was the same, but somehow, it didn't feel a lot like The Magnificent Seven. There was a bit of detraction, but the story was there. I didn't find too many faults about the film; it was a good old fashioned but refreshing Western entertainment from start to finish with no bravado or anything like it. In fact, The Magnificent Seven Ride did have scenes of cold, hard truths about it. All in all, Lee Van Cleef...good job.",4,A Great Lee Van Cleef Picture,1402617600,"06 13, 2014",2014,1165,"['Viewed', '6/14Rate', '86/14', 'Having', 'seen', 'first', 'three', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'films', 'came', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'Ride', 'expecting', 'be', 'worst', 'film', 'yet', 'astounding', 'thing', 'happened', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'far', 'best', 'sequel', 'series', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'thanks', 'Lee', 'Van', 'Cleef', 'who', 'could', 'almost', 'stand', 'toe-to-toe', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'really', 'made', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'even', 'film', 'was', 'fourth', 'part', 'very', 'tough', 'feat', 'pull', 'off', 'Probably', 'what', 'really', 'helped', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'Ride', 'most', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'was', 'cast', 'was', 'perfectly', 'assembled', 'Not', 'single', 'actor', 'looked', 'part', 'thus', 'were', 'natural', 'looked', 'bit', 'character', 'story', 'was', 'same', 'somehow', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'lot', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'was', 'bit', 'detraction', 'story', 'was', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'too', 'many', 'faults', 'film', 'was', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'refreshing', 'Western', 'entertainment', 'start', 'finish', 'bravado', 'anything', 'fact', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'Ride', 'did', 'have', 'scenes', 'cold', 'hard', 'truths', 'Lee', 'Van', 'Cleef', 'good', 'job']",The Magnificent Seven Ride

A Marshall recruits a gang of incarcerated criminals to take on a vicious, notorious gang who are terrorizing the area and in particular a village composed (naturally) of women.

804212,A7Y6AVS576M03,B0001GF2JM,gobirds2,"[23, 23]","I grew up with the original THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (1960) to the extent that it became an integral part of my youth. I greeted RETURN OF THE SEVEN (1966) with open arms and grew to endear GUNS OF THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (1968). I first saw THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN RIDE! in 1972 on its initial theatrical release. In many ways it brakes away from the story line formula established by its three predecessors and in some ways is a disappointment.The character of Chris, the leader of the seven now portrayed by Lee Van Cleef, is a complete departure from that established by Yul Brynner in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN and again in RETURN OF THE SEVEN. Instead of a noble gunslinger that skirts the law, Lee Van Cleef's Chris is a cynical lawman who shoots first and asks questions latter. We see Van Cleef reluctant to help an old friend (Ralph Waite) who desperately needs his aid. Van Cleef's Chris is even happily married (to Mariette Hartley) as opposed to Brynner's Chris who was the immitigable stoic yet virtuous loner.Much of the plot also goes against formula except for the conflict and climax which ultimately has the seven going up against seemingly insurmountable odds from yet another bandit leader. The earlier part of the film has lawman Chris pursued by journalist Noah Forbes (Michael Callan) who is bent on making him a legendary Western hero in print. It also deals with Chris avenging the murder and ravaging of his wife by a pair of young thugs (Gary Busey and Hank Allan). Gradually the film falls into the formula of the seven coming to the rescue of the downtrodden once again. Interestingly, the film once again breaks formula when Chris recruits the seven. After signing on journalist Forbes, we get shades of THE DIRTY DOZEN when Chris goes to the territorial prison to recruit five inmates to round out the seven. These men are portrayed by Ed Lauter, Luke Askew, James B. Sikking, Pedro Armendariz Jr. and Bill Lucking.The film's budget looks terribly feeble in comparison to its three predecessors. It looks like a ""back lot"" production. Even Elmer Bernstein's score has lost its majestic quality. The orchestra sounds as if it were manned far below that of a standard size symphony, which can not be blamed on Bernstein if that's what the budget allowed. Some of the film's strong points are its witty dialog, an excellent performance by Luke Askew and the preparation and defense of the village by the seven.THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN RIDE! seems much less like the fourth film in a movie series but rather a half-hearted effort to turn out one more story that may have looked more effective on television than on the big screen. The presence of Stefanie Powers as the love interest even seems to reinforce this impression. In some ways THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN RIDE! is an appropriate end to this quartet of films. It was really a reflection of the times. It represented an end of an era when the Western once rode tall in the saddle of the silver screen. By 1972 that era was sadly coming to an end. Looking back with affection I am now glad that Lee Van Cleef, a true veteran of the Western, ended this one on a note of endearing optimism. The spirit of those magnificent seven men will always live in our hearts.",5,End of an Era,1081987200,"04 15, 2004",2004,3228,"['grew', 'up', 'original', 'THE', 'MAGNIFICENT', 'SEVEN', '1960', 'extent', 'became', 'integral', 'part', 'youth', 'greeted', 'RETURN', 'THE', 'SEVEN', '1966', 'open', 'arms', 'grew', 'endear', 'GUNS', 'THE', 'MAGNIFICENT', 'SEVEN', '1968', 'first', 'saw', 'THE', 'MAGNIFICENT', 'SEVEN', 'RIDE', '1972', 'initial', 'theatrical', 'release', 'many', 'ways', 'away', 'story', 'line', 'formula', 'established', 'three', 'predecessors', 'ways', 'disappointment.The', 'character', 'Chris', 'leader', 'seven', 'now', 'portrayed', 'Lee', 'Van', 'Cleef', 'complete', 'departure', 'established', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'THE', 'MAGNIFICENT', 'SEVEN', 'again', 'RETURN', 'THE', 'SEVEN', 'Instead', 'noble', 'gunslinger', 'law', 'Lee', 'Van', 'Cleef', 'Chris', 'cynical', 'lawman', 'who', 'shoots', 'first', 'asks', 'questions', 'latter', 'see', 'Van', 'Cleef', 'reluctant', 'help', 'old', 'friend', 'Ralph', 'Waite', 'who', 'desperately', 'aid', 'Van', 'Cleef', 'Chris', 'even', 'happily', 'married', 'Mariette', 'Hartley', 'opposed', 'Brynner', 'Chris', 'who', 'was', 'immitigable', 'stoic', 'yet', 'virtuous', 'loner.Much', 'plot', 'also', 'formula', 'conflict', 'climax', 'ultimately', 'seven', 'going', 'up', 'seemingly', 'insurmountable', 'odds', 'yet', 'bandit', 'leader', 'earlier', 'part', 'film', 'lawman', 'Chris', 'pursued', 'journalist', 'Noah', 'Forbes', 'Michael', 'Callan', 'who', 'bent', 'making', 'legendary', 'Western', 'hero', 'print', 'also', 'Chris', 'avenging', 'murder', 'ravaging', 'wife', 'pair', 'young', 'thugs', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'Hank', 'Allan', 'Gradually', 'film', 'formula', 'seven', 'coming', 'rescue', 'downtrodden', 'once', 'again', 'Interestingly', 'film', 'once', 'again', 'breaks', 'formula', 'when', 'Chris', 'seven', 'signing', 'journalist', 'Forbes', 'get', 'shades', 'THE', 'DIRTY', 'DOZEN', 'when', 'Chris', 'territorial', 'prison', 'recruit', 'five', 'inmates', 'round', 'out', 'seven', 'men', 'are', 'portrayed', 'Ed', 'Lauter', 'Luke', 'Askew', 'James', 'B.', 'Sikking', 'Pedro', 'Armendariz', 'Jr.', 'Bill', 'Lucking.The', 'film', 'budget', 'terribly', 'feeble', 'comparison', 'three', 'predecessors', 'back', 'lot', 'production', 'Even', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'score', 'lost', 'majestic', 'quality', 'orchestra', 'sounds', 'were', 'manned', 'far', 'standard', 'size', 'symphony', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'blamed', 'Bernstein', 'what', 'budget', 'allowed', 'film', 'strong', 'points', 'are', 'witty', 'dialog', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Luke', 'Askew', 'preparation', 'defense', 'village', 'seven.THE', 'MAGNIFICENT', 'SEVEN', 'RIDE', 'much', 'less', 'fourth', 'film', 'movie', 'series', 'rather', 'half-hearted', 'effort', 'turn', 'out', 'one', 'more', 'story', 'may', 'have', 'looked', 'more', 'effective', 'television', 'big', 'screen', 'presence', 'Stefanie', 'Powers', 'love', 'interest', 'even', 'reinforce', 'impression', 'ways', 'THE', 'MAGNIFICENT', 'SEVEN', 'RIDE', 'appropriate', 'end', 'quartet', 'films', 'was', 'really', 'reflection', 'times', 'represented', 'end', 'era', 'when', 'Western', 'once', 'rode', 'tall', 'saddle', 'silver', 'screen', '1972', 'era', 'was', 'sadly', 'coming', 'end', 'Looking', 'back', 'affection', 'am', 'now', 'glad', 'Lee', 'Van', 'Cleef', 'true', 'veteran', 'Western', 'ended', 'one', 'note', 'endearing', 'optimism', 'spirit', 'magnificent', 'seven', 'men', 'will', 'always', 'live', 'hearts']",The Magnificent Seven Ride
