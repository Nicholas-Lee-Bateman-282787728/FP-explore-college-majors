Well, what if?  the sum is somewhat less than the whole here,  there are interesting actors, a bit of tension,  the idea of knowing if you are a 'good' or 'bad' person.  There is memory and confusion. But there isn't a lot of interest,  everyone feels fairly despicable and the twist ending was a twist too far for me.I didn't turn it off,  I didn't wander away,  it passed the 2 hours,  but I won't be back to visit it.

Aikens,"[3, 3]","As most people have already written about the premise of the movie i will avoid going over that part again and just focus on what i liked and didnt like about the film. First of all the cast were excellent and they all did a great job. The director and the screenwriter were both excellent as well. I stayed on the edge of the seat trying to guess who was who and it did have many twists and turns in it to keep you guessing, however the ending did not quite satisfy me but i really want to watch the movie again and see what i really think of it. I'm still trying to figure out  the point of the film (which seems to be no matter who you are you will always be this person but you can choose to change, which means you will not always be who you are...so thats pretty confusing)Anyway it was a very entertaining film and i would recommend this as a rental to anyone who likes psychological type movies that keep you guessing such as memento or identity.

E Jackson,"[0, 4]","Unknown originally had potential in its storyline... but then it gradually fell apart the deeper the story went along.The movie begins by showing a bunch of guys who wake up in a warehouse.  Some of them are tied up, while others are hanging from walls with handcuffs on.When the one guy wakes up (the main character) he decides to go over and take the ropes off another guy who's tied up on a chair.  While the guy is being untied, ANOTHER guy comes walking down the stairs claiming the tied up guy is actually the enemy.This just ends up confusing all the other guys, so the majority of the storyline from this point forward is about the characters frequently questioning each other and wondering who really IS the enemy.Unfortunately the writing is really bland and WAY too much like a typical low budget action flick for my tastes.  This severely hurts the action segments.Anyway, all the guys constantly try to find ways to escape, until they eventually get a phone call from the people who threw them in the warehouse.  They threaten to return by night fall.  Well, this prompts all the characters to think strategically about their escape plans.Unfortunately it never happens and they never find a way out, so the bad guys show up at the very end.  What happens here would be a spoiler so I won't say anything.The storyline severely defies logic.  I mean, all the characters had so little trust in the one guy hanging from the wall in handcuffs that they just LEFT him there to bleed.  This was completely ridiculous writing and made no sense whatsoever.  At least they could have taken him down from the wall if their trust in him was THAT little.Overall, this movie is unfortunately just another low budget action film that doesn't deliver in any entertainment whatsoever.  It misses the mark the entire way through.  The storyline is just too generic to save it, and you've seen similar action scenes in several other movies (with better storylines and overall writing to boot).

Five men (James Caviezel, Greg Kinnear, Barry Pepper, Joe Pantoliano, and Jeremy Sisto) wake up in an old warehouse, unaware of how they got there, who each other is, or even their own identities! We are kept in the dark right along w/ these men, only getting clues in small snipets of memory as they slowly piece things together. I fully enjoyed the mystery and the feeling of being trapped in the warehouse, trying to figure out what has happened, is happening, and will happen next. I love movies that keep me guessing and hold my interest. UNKNOWN definitely works well as a suspenseful puzzler, much in the way the first SAW and CUBE did.

1012003,AQIO9QHHPFFET,B000HC2LZS,Brendan M. Howard,"[11, 14]","Film is full of movies about single amnesiacs caught up in crime and punishment and life-and-death situations, struggling to remember who they are so they can sort out what they're supposed to do. Unknown's novelty is that it sports five amnesiacs locked in a warehouse, with the group discovering that some of them were kidnappers and some of them were kidnappees. The million-dollar question, of course, is who's who.One guy's tied up (Pantoliano), one guy's been shot and handcuffed from a second-story gangway (Sisto). One guy was conked on the head (Kinnear), one guy's just trying to get by (Pepper). The main character (Caviezel), who wakes up first, discovers a gun, answers the phone and finds out the accomplices are on their way back. But is he working with them or against them? He is plagued by the possibilities, as are the rest. None of them want to feel the criminal.When Caviezel's character has a gun to someone's head in a fit of anger and frustration, yelling ""I'm not a criminal,"" Pepper bites back, hoping against hope this guy is his best friend, ""Stop acting like one.""The film's amnesiac plot, then, becomes a story of redemption. Characters are suspicious of others, yet at the same time try to convince each other that they're the good guys. When none of them want to think they're criminals, it's a statement on criminal behavior in general. With a fresh start, wouldn't most people choose not to be the bad guy?At the same time as the warehouse crew is trying to sort identities, federal, state and local police are hunting the kidnappers, with a tearful kidnappee's wife a focal point of their sympathies.Ultimately, a twist at the end shakes up what would have been a traditional wrap-up. My wife didn't mind the sudden identity change in the last five minutes, but I found it disconcerting and unsatisfying.Imperfect ending or not--you decide--Unknown will appeal to fans of the stars, the thriller genre, and most drama fans.DVD Extras: Deleted and extended scenes were definitely wise trims. Some procedural moments of police chiefs barking orders appear along with a few scenes about a local cop who runs across the warehouse before the investigators and ends up under fire. Best is a nice compassionate touch, where a detective who has to take $20 for evidence from a mentally challenged janitor digs $20 out of his own wallet to compensate him.",4,Can't We All Just Get Along?,1168819200,"01 15, 2007",2007,2381,"['Film', 'full', 'movies', 'single', 'amnesiacs', 'caught', 'up', 'crime', 'punishment', 'life-and-death', 'situations', 'struggling', 'remember', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'can', 'sort', 'out', 'what', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'do', 'Unknown', 'novelty', 'sports', 'five', 'amnesiacs', 'locked', 'warehouse', 'group', 'discovering', 'were', 'kidnappers', 'were', 'kidnappees', 'million-dollar', 'question', 'course', 'who', 'who.One', 'guy', 'tied', 'up', 'Pantoliano', 'one', 'guy', 'been', 'shot', 'handcuffed', 'second-story', 'gangway', 'Sisto', 'One', 'guy', 'was', 'conked', 'head', 'Kinnear', 'one', 'guy', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'Pepper', 'main', 'character', 'Caviezel', 'who', 'up', 'first', 'gun', 'phone', 'out', 'accomplices', 'are', 'way', 'back', 'working', 'plagued', 'possibilities', 'are', 'rest', 'None', 'want', 'feel', 'criminal.When', 'Caviezel', 'character', 'gun', 'someone', 'head', 'fit', 'anger', 'frustration', 'yelling', ""'m"", 'not', 'criminal', 'Pepper', 'back', 'hoping', 'hope', 'guy', 'best', 'friend', 'Stop', 'acting', 'one', 'film', 'amnesiac', 'plot', 'then', 'story', 'redemption', 'Characters', 'are', 'suspicious', 'others', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'try', 'convince', 'other', ""'re"", 'good', 'guys', 'When', 'none', 'want', 'think', ""'re"", 'criminals', 'statement', 'criminal', 'behavior', 'general', 'fresh', 'start', 'would', ""n't"", 'most', 'people', 'choose', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'guy', 'same', 'time', 'warehouse', 'crew', 'trying', 'sort', 'identities', 'federal', 'state', 'local', 'police', 'are', 'hunting', 'kidnappers', 'tearful', 'kidnappee', 'wife', 'focal', 'point', 'sympathies.Ultimately', 'twist', 'end', 'up', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'traditional', 'wrap-up', 'wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'sudden', 'identity', 'change', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'found', 'disconcerting', 'unsatisfying.Imperfect', 'ending', 'not', 'decide', 'Unknown', 'will', 'appeal', 'fans', 'stars', 'thriller', 'genre', 'most', 'drama', 'fans.DVD', 'Extras', 'Deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'were', 'definitely', 'wise', 'trims', 'procedural', 'moments', 'police', 'chiefs', 'barking', 'orders', 'appear', 'few', 'scenes', 'local', 'cop', 'who', 'warehouse', 'investigators', 'up', 'fire', 'Best', 'nice', 'compassionate', 'touch', 'where', 'detective', 'who', 'take', '20', 'evidence', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'janitor', 'digs', '20', 'own', 'wallet', 'compensate']",Unknown

Crockett ""Domino713""","[94, 94]","This diamond-in-the-rough film is aptly named...""Unknown"" is a virtually unknown movie that deserves far more attention than it has thus far received.A Quick Synopsis: 5 men awaken to find themselves trapped together inside an abandoned warehouse that is sealed shut, with no way out, and absolutely no memory of how they got there. Some of the men are tied up, while others are not. The men soon realize that three of them are kidnappers...and the other two are the kidnapees. But which is which? This movie takes you on a wild thrill ride as the men struggle against the situation, and each other. Who can be trusted? As their memory slowly returns to them, they frantically try to piece together the truth before their time runs out...but all is not what it seems...Greg Kinnear and James Caviezel turn in admirable performances, and help lead the cast of lesser knowns through this twisted storyline. This movie invokes many deep seated fears of trust and betrayal, while constantly keeping the audience in suspense of the true identities of each character. The only negative thing I might say about this movie was that at times the pacing seemed to be a little off, but other than that it was truly entertaining! The film will lead you down one path until you think you have a pretty good idea of whats going on, and then suddenly pull a quick 180 and completely change everything you thought you knew. It's exciting, and a lot of fun, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good thriller.Bottom line, it's time for ""Unknown"" to become well-known.",4,"With so many twists and turns, can you figure out the truth in time?",1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,1555,"['diamond-in-the-rough', 'film', 'aptly', 'named', 'virtually', 'unknown', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'attention', 'thus', 'far', 'received.A', 'Quick', 'Synopsis', '5', 'men', 'awaken', 'find', 'trapped', 'together', 'abandoned', 'warehouse', 'sealed', 'shut', 'way', 'absolutely', 'memory', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'men', 'are', 'tied', 'up', 'others', 'are', 'not', 'men', 'soon', 'realize', 'three', 'are', 'kidnappers', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'kidnapees', 'movie', 'wild', 'thrill', 'ride', 'men', 'struggle', 'situation', 'other', 'Who', 'can', 'be', 'trusted', 'memory', 'slowly', 'frantically', 'try', 'piece', 'together', 'truth', 'time', 'out', 'not', 'what', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'James', 'Caviezel', 'turn', 'admirable', 'performances', 'help', 'lead', 'cast', 'lesser', 'knowns', 'twisted', 'storyline', 'movie', 'many', 'deep', 'seated', 'fears', 'trust', 'betrayal', 'constantly', 'keeping', 'audience', 'suspense', 'true', 'identities', 'character', 'only', 'negative', 'thing', 'might', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'times', 'pacing', 'seemed', 'be', 'little', 'off', 'other', 'was', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'will', 'lead', 'down', 'one', 'path', 'think', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'whats', 'going', 'then', 'suddenly', 'pull', 'quick', '180', 'completely', 'change', 'everything', 'thought', 'knew', 'exciting', 'lot', 'fun', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'thriller.Bottom', 'line', 'time', 'Unknown', 'become', 'well-known']",Unknown

Mills ""WatchThis""","[4, 4]","Five men in a warehouse, snapping out of collective amnesia that hides a series of violent events, sets an intriguing plot for this reasonably good thriller. A few mysterious phone calls clue us and them into the imminent arrival of characters whose motivation can't be good, and who are linked to one or more of the five trapped men ..... therefore a few of them can't be saints either. This intriguing Who's Who of the warehouse moves the plot along and does a good job of maintaining viewer interest.Comparisons have been made to Memento, but this Unknown's plot is essentially constructed in forward time, rather than an overall backtracking central to Memento. A more apt comparison is Reservoir Dogs, and like that film, which entertained and intrigued, I left this one with the feeling of seeing only 80% of a movie. I would like to have left this experience with more connection to the characters' backstory and motivation. To the extent we get background, it is through a series of perfunctory flashbacks. Sure, the director is trying to simulate glimmers of returning memory experienced by the trapped men, but as the film clocks in at less than 90 minutes, there must have been a time and place to provide some more flesh. The twist at the end could have used a bit more beef and artistry as well. The film resolves, winks at us, and as we say to ourselves 'oh, so THAT's what's happening"", the credits roll, and they roll a bit too soon.For some of the reasons listed above, I developed little sympathy for the characters or their plight. It doesn't help that most of them are foul-mouthed and given to insulting each other at every turn. I'm no prude, but the 'F' word is littered through this screenplay, and inhibits the development of any viewer rapport with these individuals. Joe Pantoliano, whose acerbic presence in Memento carried a certain charm, is here reduced obnoxious whining, and spends most of the film tied to a chair. Jeremy Sisto, who has taken up some interesting projects (Suicide Kings, Paranoia 1.0, and Population 436) spends most of the time hanging from a railing.Overall this will make a good rental, just don't expect to leave the experience with any sort of lasting connection with the proceedings.

1012009,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000HC2LZS,Grady Harp,"[2, 4]","Director Simon Brand and writer Matthew Waynee are relative newcomers to the art of filmmaking and if UNKNOWN is a fair example of their capabilities, they should have promising futures. The script is clever, just obtuse enough to engage thinking on the part of the viewer, and the story is told in a manner that enhances the tension and the credibility.After compatibly bleak credits the story opens in a cement room/rooms where the bodies of five men are strewn about, each either unconscious or possibly dead. The first to rise is Jim Caviezel, battered and without memory of his identity or the situation in which he finds himself.  He sees the bodies of four other men and each 'wakes up' gradually - Greg Kinnear, Joe Pantoliano, Barry Pepper, and Jeremy Sisto.  Aside form the fact that everyone has lost his memory there is the fact that they are all hurt and trapped inside the room.  The isolation and claustrophobia takes its toll and the men each wonder who is a good guy and who is a bad guy as each tries to recall how they arrived in this terrifying situation. Interplaying with the distraught minds of the five prisoners are moments when the film throws us outside the room into the world of either criminals or detectives and a mysterious woman who is handling a bag of money. Some words about a methamphetamine lab are uttered, some telephone calls are made to the single line inside 'the room', and the identities of each of the characters takes shape as each of the imprisoned men gains bits of memory.  The five trapped men form a strange bond, ready for the return of whoever it is that placed them there, and it is only after the confrontation of the captors with the captives occurs that all of the pieces of the bizarre story are sorted out. The viewer then needs to do some mental backing up to completely understand the story.The cast is very strong - not only the five solid actors within the room, but also those 'outside', including Bridget Moynahan, Peter Stormare, Chris Mulkey, Clayne Crawford, Kevin Chapman, Mark Boone, Wilmer Calderon, and  David Selby.  But it is the choices made by director Simon Brand that make the story unique (given it has the flavor of 'Memento', Sartre's 'No Exit', 'Reservoir Dogs', 'The Usual Suspects' and others). This a fine examination of human behavior when the aspect of loss of memory impacts how 'strangers' interact to survive.

The film opens to find James Caviezel the first of five men to revive from a drugged unconsciousness.  He experiences confusion, then shock, and finally pure panic as he comprehends the danger he is in.  He is locked inside a filthy factory/meth lab.  He sees an unconscious stranger tied to a chair.  Another lies face down and bloody with a broken nose, and another is hanging by one handcuffed arm from an upstairs railing, a gunshot wound in his shoulder.  He finds two chairs, one broken, with a length of rope that has been severed.  His memory is completely gone.  He has no idea who he is and it is terrifying.  As each man recovers consciousness they fight, blame and quickly realize that two of them are victims and the others are kidnappers -- but who is who?  And then there is the sinister phone call and we learn that some really bad guys are returning from a terrible mission.  Whether criminal or victim before, these five men agree they now must work together to survive, with ""Jean Jacket"" (Caviezel) and ""Rancher Shirt"" (in an admirable performance by Barry Pepper) leading by example.This film benefited from the great ensemble acting of its five leads who, in addition to Jim Caviezel and Barry Pepper, include Greg Kinnear, Jeremy Sisto and Joe Pantoliano.  The extended cast members are also credible and sustain the edge.  Bridget Moynahan, the only female with a significant role in this gritty drama, stands out as the wife of one of the victims.  We are given so many clues that the next time I watched the DVD my thumb was on the pause button; no mistakes were made -- the film holds on to its secrets.  Flashbacks produce more and more of the characters' lives, especially Jean Jacket's (Caviezel), and the ending hits like a punch because of what we have learned about him.

Proven fickle in doctor's offices, unpinnable in medical textbooks, and about as comprehensible as the consciousness it attacks, Memory Loss is a device that can propel a story (seeMementoorEternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind) as much as it can cause it to stall (see50 First DatesorPaycheck).When its used as a gimmick, as a way to surgically graft suspense and intrigue into a script that would otherwise have none, it usually fails.  But when it is a real part of the character, when it illuminates ideas explored by the entire storyline, it can prove useful.""Unknown"" falls somewhere between the two.  The movie goes whole hog with its amnesia: five men wake up, locked in a warehouse, all of them suffering from gaps in the mind, apparantly caused by the leaking of some toxic chemicals.  They are beaten, broken, bruised, shot, and -- in two cases -- chained and bound.  After a bit of sleuthing, they realize that three of them are kidnappers, and the other two are their victims, but no one has any idea which is which.To make matters worse, the three kidnappers at the warehouse are only part of a larger group.  Through phone calls they learn that the other half of their team is soon to return, ransom money in hand (and -- unknowingly -- cops on their tails).  The infrequent jumps to these moments -- at the drop-off point, trailing the bad guys, detectives consoling distraught wives -- are necessary, but they staunch some of the suspense that the central story tries so hard to set up.The script tries to take things all across the board, using the whole gamut of emotions (and some clever, if not repetitive, dialogue) to show off its idea of the tabula rasa in all men.  Without pasts, without memories, who is ANYBODY?  What makes a bad guy bad and vice versa?  Or are such labels meaningless?  It's all too profound.Okay, it's not TOO profound, although it gets pretty labored there near the end, when realizations start to creep back into the gassed men's heads and they come to terms, in their own ways, with who they used to be, and who they believe they are now.  And as these memories tumble back with an ever-increasing rhythm, the story just as quickly crumbles, twists and double-crosses and surprises piling out and on top of each other so rapidly they become mostly pointless.In spite of the over-eager excess of the story (the director and screenwriter are both relative newbies), the cast -- James Caviezel, Greg Kinnear, Bridget Moynahan, Joe Pantoliano, Barry Pepper, Jeremy Sisto, Peter Stormare -- do a bang-up job.  This array of excellent performers works hard to smooth out the places where the story wears thin or clumps up with cliche, and they work even better in this ensemble environment.  The story may stall on its own flooded plot engine, but the actors and actresses keep pushing it along at a pretty steady clip.  Impressive turn-out all around, even if the end product is, well, rather forgettable.",4,Hello!

Unknown is an independent film of sorts that, as far as I know, has never seen the light in a major theater. However, these aspects are what make the film so great. You haven't been shown the twist in commercials and, like so many smaller films, the low budget forces a tight script and good acting, and this film has that in spades.Starring Jim Caviezel, Greg Kinnear, Joe Pantoliano, and Barry Pepper this film follows five men locked in a derelict building in the middle of the dessert, with no recollection of who they are or what had happened. All of them are bloody messes, one is handcuffed to a rail, and another is tied up. What happened? Through brief flashbacks and a news paper article on the floor, the men discover that these events revolve around two kidnappings. If there are five men though, three must then be in on the crime. They also discover their amnesia has been caused by a chemical spreading from a tank in the room, probably broken in a struggle. The men argue about who could be innocent, but in the end try to escape their barred prison (building has a high security door and bulletproof glass-windows) as a team. Who is the criminal and who is the innocent? Will they make it out before the rest of the kidnappers come back? Who should we trust? These are all questions you will ask yourself while viewing this film.Unknown is like a mix of Saw's confined atmosphere with the unknown identity themed movies such as Memento. While the movie has a similar feel, I was completely immersed trying to figure out who to trust. The script also makes you root for certain members of the group that may not be one of the good guys!

All of them have lost their memories. It's obvious something very, very wrong happened: Pantoliano (forgive me; none of them get names until the very end of the film, and in the credits are referred to by pieces of clothing, so I'll use the actors' names) is tied to a chair, Sisto is handcuffed to a railing. All five are trying to figure out who the good guys and the bad guys are, what happened to their memories, and most importantly, how to get out of this stinkin' warehouse before whoever caused whatever happened shows up again. Meanwhile, in a second storyline, the bad guys, headed up by Stormare, are picking up the ransom money from a kidnapping. (You see where we're going here?) They outfox the cops. Said cops try to figure out how to follow them back to their hideout before it's too late-- now that they have the ransom money, what do they need with the hostage?While the common ""don't any of these guys have wallets?"" complaint is probably a valid one, I was willing to suspend disbelief enough to run with it, and I thought it was a fun thrill ride. Matthew Waynee's script is well-paced for this sort of thing, feeding the audience a tidbit of information or two every time it looks like things are going to flag, or sending out a sightseer who completely misses the fact that a bunch of guys are yelling for help two hundred yards or so away. Meanwhile, everyone's trying to figure out who everyone else is, and most of the time, that alone is enough to keep this cracking. As is to be expected from the cast list, the acting is quite good here, certainly on a par with many of the big-budget Hollywood blockbusters I've seen recently.

The script could have been a bit more tight and thoughtful, but overall pretty good. It has some of my favorite actors in it.  It is original, good story.  It would be one I would watch again and think about philosophically.  Is man or woman essentially good or bad?  What makes a man evil?There is no easy answers in life or in this movie.",4,Unknown should be known,1176336000,"04 12, 2007",2007,446,"[""'m"", 'glad', 'picked', 'up', 'Rental', 'now', 'buy', 'list', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'tight', 'thoughtful', 'overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'favorite', 'actors', 'original', 'good', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'think', 'philosophically', 'man', 'woman', 'essentially', 'good', 'bad', 'What', 'man', 'evil', 'easy', 'answers', 'life', 'movie']",Unknown
1012030,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000HC2LZS,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 7]","This is a review of Simon Brand's `Unknown' starring Jim Caviezel, Greg Kinnear, Bridget Moynahan, Joe Pantliano, Barry Pepper, Jeremy Sisto and Peter Stormare. Though this review does not contain spoiler, I recommend that you check out this film without reading any further if you like thrillers with a twisty plot.The premise is contrived, but surely intriguing. Five characters find themselves trapped in a locked-down warehouse in the middle of desert. Some of them are injured, even tied by handcuff or rope, and no one can remember what really happened to them. Not only that; they all suffer from temporary memory loss (for the reason the film explains later), and this means they don't remember their names or identities.[WHO DO YOU TRUST?] But one thing is clear, and that is, some of them are criminals, and their accomplices doing business outside the warehouse are soon coming back to the place where they are confined. The five characters - `Jean Jacket,' `Broken Nose,' `Bound Man,' `Rancher Shirt' and `Handcuffed Man' - have to decide what to do and who is on whose side in order to survive this unusual situation.The premise might remind you of `Saw,' but Mathew Waynee's script gives more psychological aspects to the story, especially to the confused character played by Jim Caviezel who did a good job again. Well, actually everyone is confused in this thriller, and every actor gives his best to show how they are confused in different ways, which makes the film's twisty story more suspenseful. Which do you trust, loud and foul-mouthed Joe Pantliano or always irritated Greg Kennear? The choice is not as easy as it looks.Simon Brand, veteran of MTV videos and commercials, directs his first feature film, and he did a fine job without relying too much on the flashy visual techniques. He shows so-called showy MTV-style camerawork in some parts, but the film's narrative style is rather orthodox as a whole. Still more sophisticated techniques to show the actions would have improved the film for some part of it still look a little confusing.The film's knotty conclusion is overstretched, leaving countless plot holes behind. True, you never predict the ending of the film which tries to be smarter than it should. But the film works as a thriller, if not as brilliant as, say, unpredictable `Memento' and stylish `Usual Suspects,' but much better than its numerous imitations.",4,"(3.5 STARS) ""Who Do You Trust?"": Overstretched But Still Intriguing Thriller",1167091200,"12 26, 2006",2006,2402,"['review', 'Simon', 'Brand', 'Unknown', 'starring', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'Joe', 'Pantliano', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'review', 'not', 'contain', 'spoiler', 'recommend', 'check', 'out', 'film', 'reading', 'further', 'like', 'thrillers', 'twisty', 'plot.The', 'premise', 'contrived', 'surely', 'intriguing', 'Five', 'characters', 'find', 'trapped', 'locked-down', 'warehouse', 'middle', 'desert', 'are', 'injured', 'even', 'tied', 'handcuff', 'rope', 'one', 'can', 'remember', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Not', 'only', 'suffer', 'temporary', 'memory', 'loss', 'reason', 'film', 'later', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'names', 'identities', '[', 'WHO', 'DO', 'YOU', 'TRUST', ']', 'one', 'thing', 'clear', 'are', 'criminals', 'accomplices', 'doing', 'business', 'warehouse', 'are', 'soon', 'coming', 'back', 'place', 'where', 'are', 'confined', 'five', 'characters', 'Jean', 'Jacket', 'Broken', 'Nose', 'Man', 'Rancher', 'Shirt', 'Handcuffed', 'Man', 'have', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'who', 'side', 'order', 'survive', 'unusual', 'situation.The', 'premise', 'might', 'remind', 'Saw', 'Mathew', 'Waynee', 'script', 'more', 'psychological', 'aspects', 'story', 'especially', 'confused', 'character', 'played', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'who', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'again', 'Well', 'actually', 'everyone', 'confused', 'thriller', 'actor', 'best', 'show', 'how', 'are', 'confused', 'different', 'ways', 'film', 'twisty', 'story', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'do', 'trust', 'loud', 'foul-mouthed', 'Joe', 'Pantliano', 'always', 'irritated', 'Greg', 'Kennear', 'choice', 'not', 'as', 'easy', 'Brand', 'veteran', 'MTV', 'videos', 'commercials', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'relying', 'too', 'much', 'flashy', 'visual', 'techniques', 'so-called', 'showy', 'MTV-style', 'camerawork', 'parts', 'film', 'narrative', 'style', 'rather', 'orthodox', 'whole', 'Still', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'techniques', 'show', 'actions', 'would', 'have', 'improved', 'film', 'part', 'still', 'look', 'little', 'confusing.The', 'film', 'knotty', 'conclusion', 'overstretched', 'leaving', 'countless', 'plot', 'holes', 'True', 'never', 'predict', 'ending', 'film', 'be', 'smarter', 'should', 'film', 'thriller', 'not', 'as', 'brilliant', 'say', 'unpredictable', 'Memento', 'stylish', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'much', 'better', 'numerous', 'imitations']",Unknown
