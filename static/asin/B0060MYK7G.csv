1506524,A20IIR0422G3A5,B0060MYK7G,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[1, 1]","The proper comparison for ""The Borgias"" is similar 10 - 12 episode costume dramas, historical or fantastical, such as ""Rome"" and ""Game of Thrones"", not what we find in history books. There are too many deviations from history to make that comparison worthwhile, with one big exception. The historical interpretation of the Borgias as vile and immoral may be inaccurate. This dramatization seems to err on the side of making the Borgia clan no more vile and immoral than their antagonists.One thing which makes this production (both seasons) more exciting and engaging than ""Game of Thrones"" is that there is so much more light, color, and action, in spite of the fact that both lived in a world where the only light was sun and candle. Both involve battles and large armies; except that like ""Rome"", ""Game of Thrones"" keeps all that action off screen, and when it does appear at the end of season 2, it is at night, and mostly with close-ups of small groups of combatants, or with ships, done with models.As I mentioned above, the Borgias are presented as no worse than their enemies. Some opponents, like the semi-factual Niccolo Machiavelli become their friends and some appear more virtuous, such as Caterina Sforza. Juan Borgia is both dissolute, incompetent, and cowardly, with no honor to speak of. Rodrigo, Pope Alexander, is seriously flawed, but he is true to his faith and its humility, which works to his purposes, as he see's God's guidance being effective in charming his most serious opponents such as the King of France, who is one of the most interesting characters in bot seasons. Juan is so corrupt he disgusts his own ally, a Conquistador captain from Spain. Cesare and Lucrezia fall between the two. Both are willful, but smart and ruthless. Cesare leaves a lot of the dirty work to his bodyguard, Michelotto Corella, but Cesare plans all the dirty deeds, and participates in many of them, with a mask.In my review of the first season, I said it was hard to keep everyone straight, especially all the cast members who are cardinals (except for the distinct face of Derek Jacobi, who does not survive the first season.) It usually takes no more than a second viewing to sort everything out.At the risk of revealing a spoiler, I will say one of the most interesting aspects of the series is the relations between the Borgia family members, which are often no less intense than the relations with lovers and enemies.I suspect the production benefitted from being able to use buildings from the Renaissance in Rome, Milan, Naples, and Florence which are still around. When I walked the streets of Florence in 1964, it seemed as if I were walking them in 1500. Very little had changed.",5,Upgrading my assessment from Season 1,1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,2700,"['proper', 'comparison', 'Borgias', 'similar', '10', '12', 'episode', 'costume', 'dramas', 'historical', 'fantastical', 'such', 'Rome', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'not', 'what', 'find', 'history', 'books', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'deviations', 'history', 'make', 'comparison', 'worthwhile', 'one', 'big', 'exception', 'historical', 'interpretation', 'Borgias', 'vile', 'immoral', 'may', 'be', 'inaccurate', 'dramatization', 'err', 'side', 'making', 'Borgia', 'clan', 'no', 'more', 'vile', 'immoral', 'antagonists.One', 'thing', 'production', 'seasons', 'more', 'exciting', 'engaging', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'light', 'color', 'action', 'spite', 'fact', 'lived', 'world', 'where', 'only', 'light', 'was', 'sun', 'candle', 'involve', 'battles', 'large', 'armies', 'Rome', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'action', 'screen', 'when', 'appear', 'end', 'season', '2', 'night', 'mostly', 'close-ups', 'small', 'groups', 'combatants', 'ships', 'done', 'models.As', 'mentioned', 'Borgias', 'are', 'presented', 'worse', 'enemies', 'opponents', 'semi-factual', 'Niccolo', 'Machiavelli', 'become', 'friends', 'appear', 'more', 'virtuous', 'such', 'Caterina', 'Sforza', 'Juan', 'Borgia', 'dissolute', 'incompetent', 'cowardly', 'honor', 'speak', 'Rodrigo', 'Pope', 'Alexander', 'seriously', 'flawed', 'true', 'faith', 'humility', 'purposes', 'see', 'God', 'guidance', 'being', 'effective', 'charming', 'most', 'serious', 'opponents', 'such', 'King', 'France', 'who', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'bot', 'seasons', 'Juan', 'so', 'corrupt', 'own', 'ally', 'Conquistador', 'captain', 'Spain', 'Cesare', 'Lucrezia', 'fall', 'two', 'are', 'willful', 'smart', 'ruthless', 'Cesare', 'lot', 'dirty', 'work', 'bodyguard', 'Michelotto', 'Corella', 'Cesare', 'dirty', 'deeds', 'participates', 'many', 'mask.In', 'review', 'first', 'season', 'said', 'was', 'hard', 'keep', 'everyone', 'straight', 'especially', 'cast', 'members', 'who', 'are', 'cardinals', 'distinct', 'face', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'who', 'not', 'survive', 'first', 'season', 'usually', 'more', 'second', 'viewing', 'sort', 'everything', 'risk', 'revealing', 'spoiler', 'will', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'series', 'relations', 'Borgia', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'often', 'no', 'less', 'intense', 'relations', 'lovers', 'enemies.I', 'suspect', 'production', 'benefitted', 'being', 'able', 'use', 'buildings', 'Renaissance', 'Rome', 'Milan', 'Naples', 'Florence', 'are', 'still', 'around', 'When', 'walked', 'streets', 'Florence', '1964', 'seemed', 'were', 'walking', '1500', 'Very', 'little', 'had', 'changed']",The Borgias: Season 2

Well, it has intrigue, greed, lust, sex--all the elements of great storytelling.  The characters?  The Borgias were absolutely &#34;out there.&#34;  Not much else to say.  The thing that impresses me most is that this is based, albeit Hollywood-style--on real people and events, unlike that other blockbuster on the other channel.  I like both, but seeing actual historical characters and events tips the scale for me.  Jeremy Irons has never been better, and that's saying a lot since I've seen nearly everything he's acted in.  Watch the whole series, if only for him.  If you want to check for accuracy, get out a history book.  Here's the thing:  History is written by the winners, so can we ever know for sure?  What we can know is that this is a wonderful series with characters you'll love.  And hate.Warning:  There's some full frontal nudity and lots of violence.  Well, I don't think even the most sanitized history books ever portrayed them as saints.  And some Catholics may be offended at this raw look at one of their popes.

The scheming for both good and bad are here and the Borgias did stand up for the poor and it's shown here. For all of the popes phlllandering the papacy could have done a lot worse than him at the time.  This season  is even better than the first one and frankly as much as I like the other show 'borgia' this one is much better and less about rumours and more about the a solid story of the middle ages. I watched this on intant video and therefore had it streamed to me. SO I can't comment on the dvd or blu ray. In had this show looks great streaming though. The actors really have fallen into character too. Jeremy Irons has become the controversial pope so well that it's hard to imagine anyone else doing it better. I do like the Borgia cast though. Although in season one they killed off Juan and borgias is smart enough not to go that route. (this show also does not have cesare kill him off etc).

You've ...","[4, 5]","I don't know the target audience for this show-- I suppose it's for people who like the Tudors, and may be interested in the upcoming DaVinci's Demons. As someone interested in the Catholic church, and a fan of Mario Puzo who supposedly found his inspiration in this family, I found it intriguing. The series is mostly quiet, with a lot of plotting in hushed voices, then someone gets a throat slashed or gets poisoned. Battles are either thwarted or mostly fought off screen, though individual murders happen all the time. I think there is enough sex, story and eye candy for most people.A lot of people complain how the show deviates from history, just like the vocal Game of Thrones fanbase is locked in an eternal struggle between book fans and TV show fans. If you have doubts, I think Showtime has the full season 2 premiere free to watch on their website. The episode can stand enough on its own that you can understand what is going on and get a feel for whether or not you will like it.SPOILER ALERTThere are a few stand out parts for me. We finally find out more about Micheletto the assassin when he travels to his home town with Cesare. The scenes with his mother are hilarious, and we find out why he doesn't ever seem to be preoccupied with a girl or brothels.Lucrezia, the Pope's current mistress, and the mother of his children set out to make sure church funds go to the poor where they are supposed to go. It seems that all the women the Pope sleeps with ultimately become agents of his, doing favors for him like this. One is placed in charge of finding cannons when the French army approaches again. Lucrezia is in charge of the Vatican when the Pope has to go on a journey.The tension between Juan and his two siblings, Cesare and Lucrezia, builds to a fever pitch upon his return to Rome after a hiatus in Spain. Juan kind of gets what he deserves, and Cesare more put him out of his misery than murders him. The scene where the Pope/Rodrigo Borgia buries his son Juan intermixed with scenes of Lucrezia's wedding was very well done. I hope the music score for the second season will be released, because it helped make that moment all the more poignant.Cesare has longed to stop being a cardinal and to be a soldier in the Papal army since the beginning, and this season he dons a mask to avenge his dead lover and to steal gold in an effort to get the Pope to release him. I don't know if his costume was supposed to be true to the period or not, or if they intended it, but the scenes where he puts on his mask and runs about in his armor are hysterical. By day, he's a cardinal, by night, he's Batman! With Micheletto as Robin, and a band of outlaws and no-goods as their Merry Men, the Batman tortures, kills and steals to set right what once was wrong! The mask looks so bad that I couldn't stop laughing.There are really no extras on the blu ray to speak of. The special features that do exist all seem to be on BD live, and you have to have an internet connection for that. I can't tell you how incredibly annoying that is. There are 2 episodes of Californication and 2 episodes of House of Lies that you can access through the BD live, but neither of these shows interest me in the least. They would have been better off including a couple of key episodes of the Tudors if they needed filler-- at least it would be a related genre. I really resent paying for the discs and then having to go online to ask permission to watch the extras. There aren't even any episodes with commentary as far as I can tell.This show could benefit greatly form a slightly larger budget, and perhaps one or two more episodes per season to keep a better pace. If you're preoccupied by the problems in the modern Catholic church, if you're easily offended by most things that come out of an HBO or Showtime series, if you're an historical nitpicker, or if you're expecting the show to wow you on all levels, don't watch it. It is a solid 4 stars, not even coming close to 5, but it is entertaining and for me a worthwhile watch.",4,Cesare Borgia is the BATMAN!,1364428800,"03 28, 2013",2013,4037,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'target', 'audience', 'show', 'suppose', 'people', 'who', 'Tudors', 'may', 'be', 'interested', 'upcoming', 'DaVinci', 'Demons', 'someone', 'interested', 'Catholic', 'church', 'fan', 'Mario', 'Puzo', 'who', 'supposedly', 'found', 'inspiration', 'family', 'found', 'intriguing', 'series', 'mostly', 'quiet', 'lot', 'plotting', 'hushed', 'voices', 'then', 'someone', 'throat', 'slashed', 'poisoned', 'Battles', 'are', 'either', 'thwarted', 'mostly', 'fought', 'off', 'screen', 'individual', 'murders', 'happen', 'time', 'think', 'enough', 'sex', 'story', 'eye', 'candy', 'most', 'people.A', 'lot', 'people', 'complain', 'how', 'show', 'history', 'just', 'vocal', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'fanbase', 'locked', 'eternal', 'struggle', 'book', 'fans', 'TV', 'show', 'fans', 'have', 'doubts', 'think', 'Showtime', 'full', 'season', '2', 'premiere', 'free', 'watch', 'website', 'episode', 'can', 'stand', 'enough', 'own', 'can', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'get', 'feel', 'not', 'will', 'like', 'it.SPOILER', 'ALERTThere', 'are', 'few', 'stand', 'out', 'parts', 'finally', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'Micheletto', 'assassin', 'when', 'home', 'town', 'Cesare', 'scenes', 'mother', 'are', 'hilarious', 'find', 'out', 'why', ""n't"", 'ever', 'seem', 'be', 'preoccupied', 'girl', 'brothels.Lucrezia', 'Pope', 'current', 'mistress', 'mother', 'children', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'sure', 'church', 'funds', 'go', 'poor', 'where', 'are', 'supposed', 'go', 'women', 'Pope', 'ultimately', 'become', 'agents', 'doing', 'favors', 'One', 'placed', 'charge', 'finding', 'cannons', 'when', 'French', 'army', 'approaches', 'again', 'Lucrezia', 'charge', 'Vatican', 'when', 'Pope', 'go', 'journey.The', 'tension', 'Juan', 'two', 'siblings', 'Cesare', 'Lucrezia', 'fever', 'pitch', 'return', 'Rome', 'hiatus', 'Spain', 'Juan', 'kind', 'what', 'Cesare', 'more', 'put', 'misery', 'murders', 'scene', 'where', 'Pope/Rodrigo', 'Borgia', 'son', 'Juan', 'intermixed', 'scenes', 'Lucrezia', 'wedding', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'hope', 'music', 'score', 'second', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'helped', 'make', 'moment', 'more', 'poignant.Cesare', 'longed', 'stop', 'being', 'cardinal', 'be', 'soldier', 'Papal', 'army', 'beginning', 'season', 'mask', 'avenge', 'dead', 'lover', 'steal', 'gold', 'effort', 'get', 'Pope', 'release', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'costume', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'true', 'period', 'not', 'intended', 'scenes', 'where', 'mask', 'armor', 'are', 'hysterical', 'day', 'cardinal', 'night', 'Batman', 'Micheletto', 'Robin', 'band', 'outlaws', 'no-goods', 'Merry', 'Men', 'Batman', 'tortures', 'kills', 'steals', 'set', 'right', 'what', 'once', 'was', 'wrong', 'mask', 'so', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'are', 'really', 'extras', 'blu', 'ray', 'speak', 'special', 'features', 'do', 'exist', 'seem', 'be', 'BD', 'live', 'have', 'have', 'internet', 'connection', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'are', '2', 'episodes', 'Californication', '2', 'episodes', 'House', 'Lies', 'can', 'access', 'BD', 'live', 'shows', 'interest', 'least', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'off', 'including', 'couple', 'key', 'episodes', 'Tudors', 'needed', 'filler', 'least', 'would', 'be', 'related', 'genre', 'really', 'resent', 'paying', 'discs', 'then', 'having', 'go', 'online', 'ask', 'permission', 'watch', 'extras', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'episodes', 'commentary', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell.This', 'show', 'could', 'benefit', 'greatly', 'form', 'slightly', 'larger', 'budget', 'perhaps', 'one', 'two', 'more', 'episodes', 'season', 'keep', 'better', 'pace', ""'re"", 'preoccupied', 'problems', 'modern', 'Catholic', 'church', ""'re"", 'easily', 'offended', 'most', 'things', 'come', 'HBO', 'Showtime', 'series', ""'re"", 'historical', 'nitpicker', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'show', 'wow', 'levels', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'solid', '4', 'stars', 'not', 'even', 'coming', 'close', '5', 'entertaining', 'worthwhile', 'watch']",The Borgias: Season 2

And their hair is feathered and blown out so big that the men look like singers from an 80's metal hair band! (Twisted Sister does Rome.) I did not know they had blow dryers in the Middle Ages.
