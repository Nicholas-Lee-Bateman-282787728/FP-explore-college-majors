But the images in this movie etched themselves into my brain like no other. Does it have flaws? Hell yes. There's some crappy acting (not across the board though--some is quite strong), bad pacing, lots of failed attempts at sophisticated pop psychology, and some really weird choices in how to portray a deaf woman (although it did for some reason give me a chill every time she says they have to look at her so she can read their lips)...but the overarching fact is this: Gepetto is bar none the most frightening serial killer I have ever seen on film. Got that world? THE MOST FRIGHTENING CINEMATIC SERIAL KILLER EVER! Maybe. I still have more films to watch.

1539353,AYG1U47VFZ165,B007WMOJJ2,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 0]","Don&#8217;t believe what your parents tell you, kiddies: horror films are a tough sell.  Of course, they&#8217;re usually cheaply made, often times feeling like they&#8217;ve been shot on-the-fly in some abandoned warehouse or condemned property, but where does the inspiration to tell a particular story come from?  Therein lies the greatest challenge.  How do you capture lightning in a bottle?  Do you explore ghosts, goblins, or the supernatural?  Are you dealing with some rabid serial killer with a penchant to torture his victims before he offs them from our plane of existence?  Do you spend a fortune on buckets of blood, or is it your chosen weapon of distinction little more than psychological horror?You have to have something that gets both the audience and the potential victim&#8217;s adrenaline pumping, and I suspect somewhere in that complex formula the minds behind CASSADAGA lost their way just a bit, relying on drama when most people showed up expecting to be scared out of the socks!(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)A deaf art teacher, Lily Morel (played by a winsome Kelen Coleman, looking an awful lot like Mila Kunis&#8217;s younger sister) is forced to come to terms with the accidental death of her young sister.  Seeking refuge, she travels to the small community of Cassadaga, where a private school hires her to instruct its young students.  But instead of finding peace and quiet, Lily finds herself possessed by the spirit of a recently murdered woman, and that spirit wants nothing more to make use of Lily&#8217;s gifts in order to achieve whatever justice remains against her elusive attacker &#8211; a man with a dark desire to transform his victims into life-sized marionettes.Uneven and heavy, CASSADAGA begins with a brief vignette involving a young cross-dressing boy, his angrier-than-usual mother, and a desperate (and necessarily bloody) act of self-mutilation.  From there, the story segues into yet another brief vignette, this one meant to introduce our main character &#8211; the lovely Lily Morel &#8211; as well as her sister and the circumstances of their mutual tragedy.  Then the tale morphs into (finally!) the main plot which involves Lily&#8217;s attempts to kinda/sorta either &#8216;get on&#8217; or &#8216;start over&#8217; her life sans the driving force in her life (the dead sister); she travels to a small town &#8211; requiring another bit of exposition &#8211; in Florida that just so happens to be the epicenter of psychic activity &#8230; and then there&#8217;s another dead girl&#8217;s story &#8230; and then &#8230;Do you see where this is going?I can appreciate a story that comes with several layers.  In fact, those are generally the films I tend to gravitate toward, appreciate the talent of a gift screenwriter who longs to create a fully fleshed world wherein whatever truth and/or consequences indigenous to the plot get exposed through the creative light of day.  But, for Pete&#8217;s sake, scribes Bruce Wood and Scott Poiley (both with some modest credentials in the world of screen horror) pack way too much atmosphere into &#8211; come the end &#8211; is little more than a ghost story.  Granted, some of it was needed in order to distinguish CASSADAGA from the next ghost story in the marketplace, but it&#8217;s been my experience that horror films work best when they&#8217;re lean, mean, fighting machines.  As the completed film stands, this one is too dense for its own good, leaving the scares few and far between.That complaint aside, I have to give kudos where kudos are earned.  Director Anthony DiBlasi (this was just his second feature) attacked each and every scene cinematically as if it had massive importance to the overall tone of the picture; while some of it understandably goes on too long (contributing to an already bloated script), it&#8217;s still admirable work.  Kelen Coleman brings a young, freshness to her portrayal of Lily, and against all odds she makes viewers care about this struggling young woman and what she&#8217;s going through.  Lastly, Kevin Alejandro puts in a good turn as a single father trying to put wrong those things awry from his own life choices; similarly, you care about him and the relationship with his daughter if you&#8217;re watching close enough &#8211; given that most folks expected a horror picture, I&#8217;m not sure they did.CASSADAGA (2011) is produced by Poiley Wood Entertainment and Cassadaga Film Production.  DVD distribution is being handled through Archstone Distribution.  As to the technical specifications, the film is smartly made, offering up a quality sight and sound experience strengthened by some better-than-average cinematography.  As is too often the case with smaller pictures, there are no special features to speak of, and (as always) I think that&#8217;s a huge miss: some production interviews would&#8217;ve cost nothing to add to this slim package.RECOMMENDED.  The problem is that a fine workmanship quality to the direction doesn&#8217;t always translate into a quality motion picture experience, and, as much as I wanted to enjoy CASSADAGA, in the end I felt it raised far more questions than it legitimately answered in its 1:52:00 run-time.  As is the case with so many features these days, do stay in your seats because, after the credits, there&#8217;s a brief coda that attempts to give hope for those who enjoyed it of a follow-up, though one certainly isn&#8217;t needed based on the story presented here.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Archstone Distribution provided me with a DVD copy of CASSADAGA by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,Overlong & Overwrought CASSADAGA Could&#8217;ve Been A Gem If It Hadn&#8217;t Tried So Hard,1388448000,"12 31,

1539354,A3JWR2O1MZ7VNE,B007WMOJJ2,Elizabeth Renee Blue,"[0, 0]","Well, color me surprised! After Dark can be hit or miss. This is a grand slam. We've got a very rootworthy protagonist. She's smart, resourceful, resilient, and strong. She carries most of the film, as the other characters don't really get much screentime. Mike was a good foil for her, though I don't appreciate what he did. The psychic scenes were very effective. Love the blind guy. &#34;Gepetto&#34; was a real sicky. I'm so glad they didn't use a big guy in overalls. I am so over that. Not scary, guys! They need some charisma or some menace aside and  size alone doesn't cut it. This guy had the serial killer &#34;it&#34; factor working for him and a very creative way of executing his &#34;craft&#34;. Thanks for that. The horror visuals actually worked and the flashbacks kept the pace moving. The movie moved along very well. There were several scenes with suspense and tension. The remainder was intriguing, as to what, who, and why? There were also no plot holes, though the killer was largely unexplored, like what made him tick. No backstory there.

A psycho kidnapping people to turn them into living marionette dolls?!  Freaky! But in Cassadaga you only get to see less than ten minutes showcasing that juicy plot. Instead, most of the movie focuses on a young deaf woman who deals with mystery clues slowly given by a ghost she's trying to help. There's also a newly divorced father she dates for a minute who turns out to be just another unheroic dud who had no necessity in the movie whatsoever. I liked how she eventually dealed with the serial killer at the very end, but a lot of the movie crept too slowly to the action and that started to bore me.

This leads to a self mutilation. We then move to the present, some unspecified years later. Lily (Kelen Coleman) is a deaf art teacher. Her sister (Sarah Sculco) speaks French then gets hit by a bus causing Lily to leave her job and relocate at Cassadaga, a Florida town known for its psychics.Here she meets Mike (Kevin Alejandro) the father of a student. She teaches for Mrs. Anderson (Louise Fletcher) whose recluse grandson Thomas (Lucas Beck) likes to polish his furniture while watching Internet porn. After contacting a local psychic (Avis-Marie Barnes), a portal opens which allows an angry spirit to come through and haunt Lily.The film was interesting as you see a plot and a slightly confusing minor subplot of the past.

She accepts a scholarship at a small, private college in the spiritualist community of Cassadaga.  The school is run by an elderly woman named Claire (Louise Fletcher) and Lily is allowed to move into an old house on the property.  Shortly after arriving Lily, who is also helping teach art at a local elementary school, meets Mike (Kevin Alejandro of &#8220;True Blood&#8221;) and they begin dating.  Along with some friends they visit a local spirit medium so Lily can try to contact her sister.  But the s&eacute;ance goes awry and they end up contacting a vengeful spirit.Lily learns she&#8217;s being haunted by the spirit of another young woman who attended the school and fell prey to a psychotic killer who abducts women and severs their limbs to turn them into human marionettes.  Lily has to unravel the mystery of the murdered girl before the killer can make her his next victim.Cassadaga isn&#8217;t overflowing with scares but it does feature a mystery you can sink your teeth into with several red herrings along the way.  For a film with a tiny budget it manages to make its handful of scares count to maximum effectiveness.  In a weakly contrived sub-plot Mike is forced to end his relationship with Lily as his ex-wife wants to use her instability against him in a custody case over his daughter.  It is unneeded padding on a film that runs about 15 minutes too long.  While the supporting cast of Fletcher and Alejandro is strong, Kelen Coleman in the lead role as Lily doesn&#8217;t have the acting chops to carry most of the action as she is being asked to do.",3,Not scary but an OK mystery,1390608000,"01 25, 2014",2014,1676,"['Lily', 'Morel', 'blind', 'art', 'student', 'who', 'devastated', 'recent', 'death', 'younger', 'sister', 'scholarship', 'small', 'private', 'college', 'spiritualist', 'community', 'Cassadaga', 'school', 'run', 'elderly', 'woman', 'named', 'Claire', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'Lily', 'allowed', 'move', 'old', 'house', 'property', 'Shortly', 'arriving', 'Lily', 'who', 'also', 'helping', 'teach', 'art', 'local', 'elementary', 'school', 'meets', 'Mike', 'Kevin', 'Alejandro', '8220', 'True', 'Blood', '8221', 'begin', 'dating', 'friends', 'visit', 'local', 'spirit', 'medium', 'Lily', 'can', 'try', 'contact', 'sister', 's', 'eacute', 'ance', 'awry', 'end', 'up', 'contacting', 'vengeful', 'spirit.Lily', '8217', 'being', 'haunted', 'spirit', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'attended', 'school', 'fell', 'prey', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'who', 'women', 'severs', 'limbs', 'turn', 'human', 'marionettes', 'Lily', 'unravel', 'mystery', 'murdered', 'girl', 'killer', 'can', 'make', 'next', 'victim.Cassadaga', 'isn', '8217', 'overflowing', 'scares', 'feature', 'mystery', 'can', 'sink', 'teeth', 'several', 'red', 'herrings', 'way', 'film', 'tiny', 'budget', 'make', 'handful', 'scares', 'count', 'maximum', 'effectiveness', 'weakly', 'contrived', 'sub-plot', 'Mike', 'forced', 'end', 'relationship', 'Lily', 'ex-wife', 'use', 'instability', 'custody', 'case', 'daughter', 'unneeded', 'padding', 'film', '15', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Fletcher', 'Alejandro', 'strong', 'Kelen', 'Coleman', 'lead', 'role', 'Lily', 'doesn', '8217', 'have', 'acting', 'chops', 'carry', 'most', 'action', 'being', 'asked', 'do']",N/A

It held my attention from the beginning to end. I liked everything about this film.. the storyline was great... the site locations was fabulous,... excellent photography... fantastic editing and production... and the actors and actresses were great! I especially liked the very attractive actress who played Lily (Kelen Coleman).. quite a stunning figure and her boyfriend Mike played by Kevin Alejandro. Lily is very pretty (looks like sarah butler in ISOYG)  and did a superb job of playing the female lead of this film. she kept my interest the whole way through the film. there is a special attraction between lily and mike and they hit if off right off the bat. There is a love scene between the two of them that is quite provocative... would have been better if a bit longer. the storyline goes like this... a young boy who has a fascination with female matinees and dresses as a girl grows up with a fixation of using live girls as his captive puppets. He goes around kidnapping and drugging his victims in the basement of his greenhouse.  Lily is going through some mentally rough times with the death of her close friend and seeks the help of a local fortune teller. Several local girls from the all girls school are kidnapped and used as playthings for this disturbed psycho. Lily is soon taken from the back of a cruiser and taken to his dungeon where he is waiting...(a brutal jump in the film goes from her being taken from the car dressed in shirt and jeans.. and then redressed in a awful girls dress.. bet some film footage hit the floor in this scene?). next she escapes and runs for safety, as the psycho is shot to death. After the credits there is a scene where she again sees her boyfriend playing baseball... and i wonder if this is a lead up for another future part. one can only hope that if there is another film made it will have both Kelen Coleman and Kevin Alejandro staring in it.overall an excellent film that i give a full 5 stars to it... great movie that would be a hit for both guys and gals.",5,a horror collector's gem,1381449600,"10 11, 2013",2013,2137,"['Just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Cassadaga', 'i', 'must', 'say', 'i', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'minute', 'great', 'work', 'held', 'attention', 'beginning', 'end', 'liked', 'everything', 'storyline', 'was', 'great', 'site', 'locations', 'was', 'fabulous', 'excellent', 'photography', 'fantastic', 'editing', 'production', 'actors', 'actresses', 'were', 'great', 'especially', 'liked', 'very', 'attractive', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Lily', 'Kelen', 'Coleman', 'quite', 'stunning', 'figure', 'boyfriend', 'Mike', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Alejandro', 'Lily', 'very', 'pretty', 'sarah', 'butler', 'ISOYG', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'playing', 'female', 'lead', 'film', 'kept', 'interest', 'whole', 'way', 'film', 'special', 'attraction', 'lily', 'mike', 'hit', 'off', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'love', 'scene', 'two', 'quite', 'provocative', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'bit', 'longer', 'storyline', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'fascination', 'female', 'matinees', 'dresses', 'girl', 'up', 'fixation', 'using', 'live', 'girls', 'captive', 'puppets', 'kidnapping', 'drugging', 'victims', 'basement', 'greenhouse', 'Lily', 'going', 'mentally', 'rough', 'times', 'death', 'close', 'friend', 'help', 'local', 'fortune', 'teller', 'Several', 'local', 'girls', 'girls', 'school', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'used', 'playthings', 'disturbed', 'psycho', 'Lily', 'soon', 'taken', 'back', 'cruiser', 'taken', 'dungeon', 'where', 'waiting', 'brutal', 'jump', 'film', 'being', 'taken', 'car', 'dressed', 'shirt', 'jeans..', 'then', 'redressed', 'awful', 'girls', 'dress..', 'bet', 'film', 'footage', 'hit', 'floor', 'scene', 'next', 'safety', 'psycho', 'shot', 'death', 'credits', 'scene', 'where', 'again', 'boyfriend', 'playing', 'baseball', 'i', 'wonder', 'lead', 'up', 'future', 'part', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'film', 'made', 'will', 'have', 'Kelen', 'Coleman', 'Kevin', 'Alejandro', 'staring', 'it.overall', 'excellent', 'film', 'give', 'full', '5', 'stars', 'great', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'hit', 'guys', 'gals']",N/A

Basic premise has Lily retreating to a new life at Cassadaga after her sister is killed in a tragic accident. Traumatised by her loss, Lily seeks the help of a medium to connect with her sister. Instead, she connects with a darker spirit which possesses her and leads her down a self-destructive and sinister path.A bizarre hybrid of TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY and RITES OF SPRING, CASSADAGA is not only an odd movie, but a slow movie too - and all the better for it. Beautifully shot with wonderful performances across the board, the characters and their interactions are the main drivers of this story. You can almost taste Lily's angst and guilt as she struggles to come to terms with her sister's tragic death, and her perceived part in such. And while some ends are left untied, the movie reaches a satisfying and heartbreaking conclusion.One of my favourite horror films of the year and a huge step forward for After Dark.",5,A nasty piece of work.,1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,1018,"['wrap', '2012', 'CASSADAGA', 'Dark', 'Films', 'release', 'Basic', 'premise', 'Lily', 'retreating', 'new', 'life', 'Cassadaga', 'sister', 'killed', 'tragic', 'accident', 'Traumatised', 'loss', 'Lily', 'help', 'medium', 'connect', 'sister', 'Instead', 'darker', 'spirit', 'down', 'self-destructive', 'sinister', 'path.A', 'bizarre', 'hybrid', 'TEXAS', 'CHAINSAW', 'MASSACRE', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'RITES', 'OF', 'SPRING', 'CASSADAGA', 'not', 'only', 'odd', 'movie', 'slow', 'movie', 'too', 'better', 'Beautifully', 'shot', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'board', 'characters', 'interactions', 'are', 'main', 'drivers', 'story', 'can', 'almost', 'taste', 'Lily', 'angst', 'guilt', 'come', 'terms', 'sister', 'tragic', 'death', 'perceived', 'part', 'such', 'ends', 'are', 'left', 'untied', 'movie', 'satisfying', 'heartbreaking', 'conclusion.One', 'favourite', 'horror', 'films', 'year', 'huge', 'step', 'forward', 'Dark']",N/A
