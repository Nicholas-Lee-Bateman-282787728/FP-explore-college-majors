989288,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000FFL2GQ,A Customer,"[12, 13]","Mrs. Harris is a film that has severely divided audiences and critics. There are those who have absolutely hated this film, which is based on a true story of the tragic death of Dr. Herman Tarnower (Ben Kingsley)  - the Scarsdale Diet Doctor - supposedly by the gun of Jean Harris (Annette Bening). The murder and the proceeding trial was scandalous, after all, it had everything - sex, drugs, abuse, suicides all played out amongst the stuffy and wealthy Connecticut aristocracy.This film, made for HBO takes a rather moribund look at the events with the director Phyllis Nagy inserting some dark, almost off beat humor into the proceedings. The movie jumps around a bit, combining statements from the trial and interviews with friends and family to launch into the retelling of events that lead up to that fatal outcome.Was it murder or accidental death? The film opens with the drugged out Jean turning up to Tarnower's house one stormy night and shooting him, but was it an accidental shooting, and was she so emotionally wrought that she didn't know what she was doing? Her defense says yes, but whether she was really responsible or not is up to you, though history states that Mrs. Harris was found guilty.The suspense is a bit spoilt from showing us what actually happened that fateful night, but the film is still an entertaining and somewhat cautionary tale of a relationship that has gone terribly wrong. Both Kinsley and Bening are perfect as the respective couple, he manipulative, icy and dispassionate, and she the victim, not only of the prescription drugs he constantly doles out to her, but also of his emotional abuse.It's hard to believe that such an intelligent and respectable woman such as Jean Harris - she was a head mistress of an exclusive girl's school - would find her self embroiled in such an affair and it ultimately cause her undoing. She actually spent fourteen years and thousands of miles ferrying to and from his bed, putting up with his obnoxious sister, finding out he'd never marry her, and discovering other women's lingerie in his bathroom.So it remains a bit of a mystery why he had such a hold on her, maybe she was a bit narcissistic in the first place, or maybe she was just in it for the drugs, or maybe as the film suggests in a provocative locker room scene, it was actually his masculine organ that had her enthralled.Mrs. Harris reads like a who's who of A-list actors. Much of the film hangs on cameos by Ellen Burstyn to Brett Butler to Chlo Sevigny, Mary McDonnell, and Philip Baker Hall. None of them are really given that much to do. Leave it to Frances Fisher as Jean's worried friend, Frank Whaley for the prosecution, Bill Smitrovich for the defense, and Cloris Leachman as Hy's sister Pearl, to get the lions share of the action.The tale is no doubt tawdry and the characterizations are over-the-top, but Mrs. Harris is never boring, with the lovely Mrs. Bening giving a performance that totally anchors the film. Obviously, Tarnower wasn't the most attractive of men, and Kinsley plays him almost as a borderline misogynist. His incessant womanizing and her drug-heightened dependency on him constantly put off Jean, yet mysteriously, she kept going back to him.The film works best when it deals with the nuts and bolts of their relationship, suggesting that it was based on much more than Joan just wanting him for his money and success and her eventual downward spiral is played both tender and sad. It makes you think that there was certainly a connection there - after all, over the years there was certainly lots of dancing, boating, eating, and sex - along with fourteen years of temper tantrums, tumultuousness, infidelity and ultimately death.

989290,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000FFL2GQ,Grady Harp,"[4, 9]","MRS. HARRIS is an HBO dud movie, and that is primarily because of the content of the story, the writing, the direction, and the waste of some fine actors' time. Based on a book by Shana Alexander adapted for the screen and directed by Phyllis Nagy, the story relates in fractured pieces between a murder scene, a trial and flashbacks the pathetic story of the death of Dr. Herman Tarnower (a wasted Ben Kingsley) the Scarsdale Diet author/doctor/womanizer at the hands of Mrs. Jean Harris (Annette Bening) a upwardly climbing school marm who becomes Tarnower's live in lover and addicted to his prescribed drugs. Her life is plagued by Tarnower's inability to keep his apparent elephantine genitals (this is made clear in an extended ridiculously inane segment in a locker room!) in his pants and eventually her own shaky self perception leads her to a suicide attempt that results in Tarnower's murder. The story is based on fact so there is no giving away an ending.The only reason to watch this bit of tripe is Annette Bening who is such a gifted actress that she can make a silk purse out of a sow's ear - and this screenplay is definitely the latter. A surprising squandering of money is obvious in the casting of bit parts to fine actors such as Cloris Leachman, Brett Butler, Ellen Burstyn, Mary McDonnell, Phillip Baker Hall, Chloe Sevigny, etc. Many have only one line! Otherwise this is a one of those films that relies on media blitz spectacle posing as a worthy story to create a movie. A must miss - except for Bening.

989293,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000FFL2GQ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 8]","I keep finding myself thinking what ""Mrs. Harris"" would have been like if it i had been written and directed by Oliver Stone instead of Phyllis Nagy.  That is because when Stone does a ""true story,"" he clearly dramatizes his take on the events.  In point of fact, his reputation is for over dramatizing his perspective.  By the end of a film like ""JFK"" you not only know what he wants us to think about each and every one of the ""real"" people in the story but that if we do not agree with Stone's take on the people and events that he clearly thinks there is something wrong with us.  But by the end of ""Mrs. Harris"" I am not sure what Nagy thinks about these characters or even if she wants us to think anything particular about them except that these are unpleasant people.This HBO movie is about Jean Harris, the woman show shot Herman Tarnower, the Scarsdale Diet doctor.  We see the fatal night both at the beginning and again at the end of the film, but played out differently the second time around.  But the exact relationship between the two is somewhat enigmatic.  My reading is that the first is a black comedy version, which seems at odds with her behavior afterwards, and the second is more of what ""really"" happened, although even it is inconsistent with what I have read about the case.  Perhaps it does nothing more than bring the story full circle, because without the murder nobody would care about either of these people.  Without the diet book we probably never would have heard about this case, because the murder happened in 1980, long before Court TV and scavengers like Nancy Grace were given television time to feed on the carcasses.The title sequence has footage from black & white films where a woman guns down a man in cold blood, which suggests that what Jean Harris did to Hy Tarnower is an old story.  However the first killing sequence proves that Jean Harris does not fit the classic mold, which is why the scene smacks of black comedy.  The main part of the film mixes the story of her relationship with Tarnower with scenes from her trial and documentary style testimonials from family and friends of the unhappy couple.  Title cards spring up from time to time, declaring what is coming up constitutes ""Physical Evidence"" or ""Reasonable Doubt,"" but the labels are often tenuous and trying to figure out how what follows fits is not worth the bother.The killer and the victim are played by Annette Bening and Ben Kingsley, so there is no faulting the performances because they make these two people particularly unpleasant.  They certainly compel our attention when they are on screen.  The problem is that few viewers are going to be able to identify with either of them, which makes feeling sympathy for them difficult as well.  She is the more sympathetic figure by default, simply because he treats her so callously.  But by maintaining some approximate ambiguity as to her ""guilt"" or ""innocence,"" the film wants to have it both ways and ends up losing its way.  It is left up to me to think what I want to think about Jean Harris and the murder, and in the end I decide to think nothing about it at all.  Her behavior on the stand seemed to condemn her more than anything else, which is not really how the world should work, but the film does not really take a stance on that either.There are two excellent commentary tracks on this DVD, but they are not enough to justify my rounding up on this 2005 HBO film.  The first has Bening and Kingsley, whose mutual admiration society is thoroughly justified.  They do not talk idly, but provide insightful comments.  Kingsley is particularly interesting to listen to and any movie he does from now until the end of time the producers should get him to do a commentary track on the DVD.  Writer-director Nagy has a lot to say about the production, including the two different versions of the shooting, in what ends up being a nice example of a whole lot, too late.  I do not remember seeing a DVD where the commentary tracks are so superior to the movie.  You could almost be convinced that the movie is as good as these three think it is, but not quite.",3,"Jean Harris shoots the Scarsdale Diet Doctor, but it is nothing to get excited about",1154649600,"08 4, 2006",2006,4138,"['keep', 'finding', 'thinking', 'what', 'Mrs.', 'Harris', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'i', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'directed', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'instead', 'Phyllis', 'Nagy', 'when', 'Stone', 'true', 'story', 'clearly', 'take', 'events', 'point', 'fact', 'reputation', 'dramatizing', 'perspective', 'end', 'film', 'JFK', 'not', 'only', 'know', 'what', 'think', 'one', 'real', 'people', 'story', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'Stone', 'take', 'people', 'events', 'clearly', 'something', 'wrong', 'end', 'Mrs.', 'Harris', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'Nagy', 'characters', 'even', 'think', 'anything', 'particular', 'are', 'unpleasant', 'people.This', 'HBO', 'movie', 'Jean', 'Harris', 'woman', 'show', 'shot', 'Herman', 'Tarnower', 'Scarsdale', 'Diet', 'doctor', 'see', 'fatal', 'night', 'beginning', 'again', 'end', 'film', 'played', 'out', 'differently', 'second', 'time', 'exact', 'relationship', 'two', 'somewhat', 'enigmatic', 'reading', 'first', 'black', 'comedy', 'version', 'odds', 'behavior', 'afterwards', 'second', 'more', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'even', 'inconsistent', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'case', 'Perhaps', 'nothing', 'more', 'bring', 'story', 'full', 'circle', 'murder', 'nobody', 'would', 'care', 'people', 'diet', 'book', 'probably', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'heard', 'case', 'murder', 'happened', '1980', 'long', 'Court', 'TV', 'scavengers', 'Nancy', 'Grace', 'were', 'given', 'television', 'time', 'feed', 'carcasses.The', 'title', 'sequence', 'footage', 'black', 'white', 'films', 'where', 'woman', 'down', 'man', 'cold', 'blood', 'what', 'Jean', 'Harris', 'did', 'Hy', 'Tarnower', 'old', 'story', 'However', 'first', 'killing', 'sequence', 'proves', 'Jean', 'Harris', 'not', 'fit', 'classic', 'mold', 'why', 'scene', 'smacks', 'black', 'comedy', 'main', 'part', 'film', 'mixes', 'story', 'relationship', 'Tarnower', 'scenes', 'trial', 'documentary', 'style', 'testimonials', 'family', 'friends', 'unhappy', 'couple', 'Title', 'cards', 'spring', 'up', 'time', 'time', 'declaring', 'what', 'coming', 'up', 'constitutes', 'Physical', 'Evidence', 'Reasonable', 'Doubt', 'labels', 'are', 'often', 'tenuous', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'what', 'fits', 'not', 'worth', 'bother.The', 'killer', 'victim', 'are', 'played', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'faulting', 'performances', 'make', 'two', 'people', 'particularly', 'unpleasant', 'certainly', 'compel', 'attention', 'when', 'are', 'screen', 'problem', 'few', 'viewers', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'feeling', 'sympathy', 'difficult', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'figure', 'default', 'simply', 'so', 'callously', 'maintaining', 'approximate', 'ambiguity', 'guilt', 'innocence', 'film', 'have', 'ways', 'up', 'losing', 'way', 'left', 'up', 'think', 'what', 'want', 'think', 'Jean', 'Harris', 'murder', 'end', 'decide', 'think', 'nothing', 'behavior', 'stand', 'seemed', 'condemn', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'not', 'really', 'how', 'world', 'should', 'work', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'take', 'stance', 'are', 'two', 'excellent', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'DVD', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'justify', 'rounding', 'up', '2005', 'HBO', 'film', 'first', 'Bening', 'Kingsley', 'mutual', 'admiration', 'society', 'thoroughly', 'justified', 'do', 'not', 'talk', 'idly', 'provide', 'insightful', 'comments', 'Kingsley', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'listen', 'movie', 'now', 'end', 'time', 'producers', 'should', 'get', 'do', 'commentary', 'track', 'DVD', 'Writer-director', 'Nagy', 'lot', 'say', 'production', 'including', 'two', 'different', 'versions', 'shooting', 'what', 'up', 'being', 'nice', 'example', 'whole', 'lot', 'too', 'late', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'where', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'are', 'so', 'superior', 'movie', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'convinced', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'three', 'think', 'not', 'quite']",N/A
989294,A228JH8V9Y700G,B000FFL2GQ,MortensOrchid,"[0, 0]","I went to Jean Harris's high school, she is the most famous alum to come out of it (for obvious reasons) and is still talked about today among the student body and staff.  Many saw this as a travesty that such a woman from such a fine background spent so many years rotting in prison, and many saw it as fair justice.  She did kill the guy, after all.  Many books have been written about this case, but this was the first movie that I had ever seen of this tale and it was quite good.Jean Harris was a well brought up woman who had been the head of a private girl's school, having worked her way up from running a pre school out of her home to the upper crust of school administration.  Although she seemed to have everything you could ever want, she was unraveling.  As covered in the movie, Jean (played with great aplumb by Annette Benning) was under some serious pressure.  Four students at her school had been busted for pot smoking (to be known as the Madieira Four).  She had angry parents, student and staff screaming at her about what was or wasn't to be done, her rocky relationship with her long term boyfriend Herman Tarnower was at its rockiest patch, and she had run out of the prescription speed that he had prescribed to her in order to keep up with her already demanding schedule.  She broke, descending down a mental illness path, and decided to commit suicide.  Instead of killing herself, she ended up killing Herman in a ""freak accident"".  And all the time, she was jealous of one of the many women that Herman was being unfaithful with, his receptionist Lynn Tryfornos (played in a very cute nurse's outfit by Chloe Sevengy).  This movie did not do a great job of covering the alleged screaming matches that went on (face to face or on the phone) between Jean and Lynn.  If anything Lynn is kind of wallpaper to the movie, but since she became such an important player in the drama she is naturally included.  Jean would spend twelve years behind bars to be paroled in 1992 and live out her remaining years quietly.What does a movie like this tell us?  Despite all the wealth and privledge that some have that others do not, they are just as likely to do bad things.  We can shake our heads, accuse one another of being among the haves and have nots, but he who is without sin may cast the first stone.  Jean and Herman were two very successful people, yet at their cores they were deeply flawed.  What if they were middle class or blue collar?  If a story like that unfolded to just such individuals, we would barely bat and eye.  This story is really a study in our double standards about social class assumption.

When she told the media that she didn't want them to say anything bad about him, I could tell she really loved him and respected him.  Plus it gave a new side to her:  In the media, she was always portrayed as a very staid woman - head mistress, upper crust.  She had a persona in the newspaper but in the movie you saw how much she liked him and how fun-loving she was toward him.  She had a sense of humor, especially when she said to him ""Dedicate herself to giving ME pain, not other women.""

That alone says something about the subject matter and/or the writer/director Phyllis Nagy. Or maybe it's just that HBO has raised the bar of prestige in the made-for-tv movie category. Whatever it is, viewers can be glad that Kingsley and Bening chose to be part of this film.Mrs. Harris covers the controversial trial of Jean Harris for the murder of diet specialist Dr. Herman Tarnower. It also covers, in flashbacks, the various accounts of events leading up to the actual murder/accidental death of Dr. Tarnower.Mrs. Harris ultimately serves as a vehicle to present superb acting by both Kingsley and Bening, whether they are on screen together or not, each of them brings so much to their characters: Bening creating the defiant, yet slightly off-balance female character we've seen in American Beauty and Running With Scissors, and Kingsley creating a sociopathic self-centered doctor, kind of like a light-hearted version of his character in Sexy Beast.in the end, the viewer is left to decide for themselves what really happened that fateful night that Dr. Tarnower was shot by his jilted ex-lover Jean Harris. I didn't feel that the film was biased either way. Really the film leaves you thinking that neither of them is blameless, and neither of them should have been around the other one anyway.The featurette offers some backstory on the trial and on the tabloid reactions, as well as some archive footage of Jean Harris herself speaking about the events.
