Nunn ""manga fan""","[5, 6]","Why is it that most harem Anime happen to have a guy who really isn't a pervert, but gets beat up because the girls think he is a pervert. Possibly, this has to do with the fact that the creators don't want to be called out as being sexist by having a guy who can go around actually being a pervert as the main characters and not get beat up.Asu No Yoichi is the type of Anime that has a serious plotline, but then ends up filled with a ton of crack humor. The jokes are harem based... in other words, they deal with sexual situations. However, these jokes are also not offensive and come across as funny. There are other side jokes and crack humor not related to the series being a harem, my favorite being the constantly shrinking best mate of the guys rival.It honestly isn't the best show out there, but to me it was an enjoyable watch. It may not be everyones cup of tea, however, it is worth checking out one time at least to see if you like it and it is yours.",3,Not Just for Harem Fans,1307404800,"06 7, 2011",2011,967,"['Why', 'most', 'harem', 'Anime', 'happen', 'have', 'guy', 'who', 'really', ""n't"", 'pervert', 'beat', 'up', 'girls', 'think', 'pervert', 'Possibly', 'do', 'fact', 'creators', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'called', 'out', 'being', 'sexist', 'having', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'go', 'around', 'actually', 'being', 'pervert', 'main', 'characters', 'not', 'get', 'beat', 'up.Asu', 'No', 'Yoichi', 'type', 'Anime', 'serious', 'plotline', 'then', 'up', 'filled', 'ton', 'crack', 'humor', 'jokes', 'are', 'harem', 'based', 'other', 'words', 'deal', 'sexual', 'situations', 'However', 'jokes', 'are', 'also', 'not', 'offensive', 'come', 'funny', 'are', 'other', 'side', 'jokes', 'crack', 'humor', 'not', 'related', 'series', 'being', 'harem', 'favorite', 'being', 'constantly', 'shrinking', 'best', 'mate', 'guys', 'rival.It', 'honestly', ""n't"", 'best', 'show', 'there', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyones', 'cup', 'tea', 'however', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'one', 'time', 'least', 'see', 'like', 'yours']",N/A
1334802,A36INLW8OL3A73,B003AND1IW,"D. Aiken ""social observer""","[49, 52]","Samurai Harem,AKA Asu No Yoichi, is a well drawn and lively comedy about a 17-year-old only son of a single samurai sword master father who raised him alone in the mountains away from others,epecially girls. After the father decides the son needs more training than he is capable of giving he sends him to a dojo run by four sisters,the oldest being,of course,17 years of age. There are no parents as they ""went on a long journey"". Our hero is a bit dense conserning life outside of the mountains and cuts a path of distrbances in the city on his way to the dojo. He is also ""completely innocent"" regarding girls but seems to get at least one nose bleed per episode...along with at least one sound thrashing at the hands of the oldest sister. He is not a player and this is not a sex romp and there is no,repeat,no fan service or nudity.While all the sisters grow to like him,only one harbors emotional feelings and another,the oldest, seems to be jealous of him whenever he is to close to other girls. He never seems to ""get a clue"" as he is living by the rules of a samurai, doing things we would probably call,in our world,""gentlemanly"" although he seems to have his hands full of breasts or his head up a skirt far more times than one would think was ""coincidental"", each incident bringing swift reproachment (beatings within an inch of his life) by the oldest sister,regardless how innocent. This series is well worth the investment in time to watch as entertainment but not for a sex-romp as,like I mentioed,there ain't any.

This one trick pony seems to capitalize off the inexperience of one guy surrounded by young ladies. After watching this anime you'll start to see the subtle influences of other anime's such as: Tenchi Muyo and Rouroni Kenchin. Its a short series and for what its worth its good to look for fun and laughs. (if you manage to see any) I call it a one trick pony because the hero Yoichi, a samurai raised and trained in the mountains by his father for his entire life is suddenly sent to live with four sisters who've also been trained in the same martial art style Yoichi uses. Complications ensue as he tries to adapt to modern life. There's plenty of fan service but not enough serious action. The show focuses more on the importantance of friends and family in every episode so much so the fight scenes are reduced to petty interludes to tie up that episodes' storyline.
