Some of it so off-the-wall it had us squirming.  But we stuck it out just to see what would be the final outcome with some bizarre plots.  The first two seasons were so much better.  Very realistic, and characters we loved to empathize with.  In Season 3 there was nothing we could identify with.  I suggest just sticking to the first 2 seasons, and make up your own ending.  It will leave you with a better taste in your mouth.",3,went downhill,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,535,"['were', 'disappointed', '3rd', 'season', 'really', 'went', 'downhill', 'storylines', 'character', 'development', 'so', 'off-the-wall', 'had', 'squirming', 'stuck', 'out', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'final', 'outcome', 'bizarre', 'plots', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Very', 'realistic', 'characters', 'loved', 'empathize', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'nothing', 'could', 'identify', 'suggest', 'just', 'sticking', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'ending', 'will', 'leave', 'better', 'taste', 'mouth']",HawthoRNe: The Complete Final Season

I think they honestly had it out for this show to begin with.

1429324,AM1LDK6ADEAP,B004UXVCYG,"Metalsmith ""Metalsmith""","[19, 20]","Sigh! What do I say. I really enjoyed seasons one and two. Waiting for season three to be released (I do not watch television) I couldn't understand why anyone would cancel a really good bit of work. Having watched season three, now I understand. What was focused on patients, hospitals and those that work there has suddenly switched to a much darker introspective detailing of a few focal characters with the hospital and patients mere, largely ignored, backdrop for some extremely depressing character assassinations.Nurse Hawthorne is badly injured and looses her baby. The trained health professionals surrounding her react by firing her and confronting her, en masse, with HER faults! This highly inappropriate response is supposedly lead by a trained crisis councilor who, apparently, has never even met the victim. An excellent chance to educate folks about trauma, reactions to trauma, and appropriate behavior with the traumatized is, instead, used to heap additional trauma on the already dazed and bleeding victim.They lost their direction and could not find their way back. Instead they kept making it worse. Perhaps it would be better thinking of HawthoRNe as having only two seasons.

There only a few patients scattered through this season. Story turned to the sad life of someone who lost her mind.
