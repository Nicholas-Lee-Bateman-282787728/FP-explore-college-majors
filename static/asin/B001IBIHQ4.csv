Artillery ""Joe""","[46, 60]","I've read the other reviewers' comments, pro & con, and am aware of the obvious comparisons of the other major works by the same production team. Comparison is tempting but the Pacific and Atlantic Theaters of war were so different in their basic strategies as to, in my opinion, defy comparison. In Europe, the Allies invaded at Normandy after securing north Africa and the Mediterranean. This made a two front war for a ""stand alone"" Germany a reality. The strategy for the Allies was to gain control of occupied geography and liberate populations. The strategy differed in the Pacific because the geography was sparsely populated by comparison and much more vast in scale. Control of airspace and the sea was viewed by both sides as essential to victory. This dictated the nature of strategies including the deployment of resources, i.e men and materials in a way devised to cut off enemy resources and destroy supply lines. ""Island Hopping"" gave the Allies that desired result without having to sustain the casualties which would have occurred with the liberation and occupation of thousands of islands. BofB reflects the nature of a huge array of armed might focused on defined geographic goals as it relates to a single unit involved in the effort from invasion to VE Day. TPac, dictated by the nature of the war was less cohesive with much smaller numbers (per action) involved in smaller geography and, by necessity, demanded a more complex mobility than was the reality in Europe. There was also a good deal of interservice rivalry that was less than ""good natured""...witness the truck scene when the Army driver does not even make the attempt at avoiding the Marines on Gualdalcanal. My father, an officer in the US Navy from the outset of the war, referenced a comment he said was oft repeated in the Pacific...""the Navy shells it and softens it up, the Marines land and fight to take it, the Army shows up to occupy it.""I find the series to be a very believable representation of what I've read and learned growing up from the conversations of those who were there. Kudos to the producers whose efforts have, thus far, shown the differences between the theaters and the impact on the men who fought in them.",5,TPac Vs BofB...not a fair comparison,1270512000,"04 6, 2010",2010,2219,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviewers', 'comments', 'pro', 'con', 'am', 'aware', 'obvious', 'comparisons', 'other', 'major', 'works', 'same', 'production', 'team', 'Comparison', 'tempting', 'Pacific', 'Atlantic', 'Theaters', 'war', 'were', 'so', 'different', 'basic', 'strategies', 'opinion', 'defy', 'comparison', 'Europe', 'Allies', 'invaded', 'Normandy', 'securing', 'north', 'Africa', 'Mediterranean', 'made', 'two', 'front', 'war', 'stand', 'alone', 'Germany', 'reality', 'strategy', 'Allies', 'was', 'gain', 'control', 'occupied', 'geography', 'liberate', 'populations', 'strategy', 'differed', 'Pacific', 'geography', 'was', 'sparsely', 'populated', 'comparison', 'much', 'more', 'vast', 'scale', 'Control', 'airspace', 'sea', 'was', 'viewed', 'sides', 'essential', 'victory', 'dictated', 'nature', 'strategies', 'including', 'deployment', 'resources', 'i.e', 'men', 'materials', 'way', 'devised', 'cut', 'off', 'enemy', 'resources', 'destroy', 'supply', 'lines', 'Island', 'Hopping', 'gave', 'Allies', 'desired', 'result', 'having', 'sustain', 'casualties', 'would', 'have', 'occurred', 'liberation', 'occupation', 'thousands', 'islands', 'BofB', 'nature', 'huge', 'array', 'armed', 'might', 'focused', 'defined', 'geographic', 'goals', 'single', 'unit', 'involved', 'effort', 'invasion', 'VE', 'Day', 'TPac', 'dictated', 'nature', 'war', 'was', 'less', 'cohesive', 'much', 'smaller', 'numbers', 'action', 'involved', 'smaller', 'geography', 'necessity', 'demanded', 'more', 'complex', 'mobility', 'was', 'reality', 'Europe', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'deal', 'interservice', 'rivalry', 'was', 'less', 'good', 'natured', 'truck', 'scene', 'when', 'Army', 'driver', 'not', 'even', 'make', 'attempt', 'avoiding', 'Marines', 'Gualdalcanal', 'father', 'officer', 'US', 'Navy', 'outset', 'war', 'referenced', 'comment', 'said', 'was', 'oft', 'repeated', 'Pacific', 'Navy', 'shells', 'up', 'Marines', 'land', 'fight', 'take', 'Army', 'up', 'occupy', 'find', 'series', 'be', 'very', 'believable', 'representation', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'learned', 'growing', 'up', 'conversations', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'Kudos', 'producers', 'efforts', 'have', 'thus', 'far', 'shown', 'differences', 'theaters', 'impact', 'men', 'who', 'fought']",N/A

1203157,AK1TMZ8NSAL9Q,B001IBIHQ4,"A. Anderson ""ann0314""","[7, 9]","OK I am posting this review as I feel some may miss out on an amazing story because they start watching with the wrong idea. My entire household has seen Band of Brothers multiple times and we LOVE the film. That being said, if you start watching The Pacific hoping for the same dynamic as Band of Brothers, you will be disappointed. We originally started watching it with that in our minds, and as a result, this film seemed to fall short...to the point we didn't even bother to finish it (I am ashamed to say)So months later, we decided to give it another go only this time knowing it was VERY different from Band of Brothers and knowing these films are shot in two very different ways, in two very different tones. Now watching it for the second time, keeping in mind that it is its own film, I can honestly say it is not better nor is it worse then Band of Brothers. It stands on its own (and wonderfully so) as a monument to all who served in the Pacific. Honestly, I really love this movie just as much as Band of Brothers and feel awful I didn't give it a chance the first time around.While Brotherhood is still a theme in this film, what shines through is the REAL emotional aspect of war. The journey from who you are to what war does to each individual and how it affects those it touches. While that was a theme in Band of Brothers, brotherhood was the more centralized theme. I think what I liked best about this series was seeing the inner conflict and how war changes a man. I appreciate that they even delved into the Post Traumatic Stress many suffered after coming home, something which Band of Brothers never really approached. It is the sheer honesty of how the mental anguish was approached that I think really made this shine. Those of you that are fans of Band of Brothers, give this movie a chance as I think you will be delightfully surprised, just don't go into watching it thinking this will be anything like Band of Brothers because everything about it is different from the way it's shot to the journey you take while watching it. It will take longer to attach to some of the people, will be a little harder to follow at the start, but by the end it truly left me in awe and even sparked a conversation with my 13 yr old son about how much has been sacrificed for the sake of all of our safety.

Because Band of Brothers is the best WWII movie in my book. I wanted to see what they could do with the war in the Pacific. When I read that The Pacific was being developed, I was overwhelmed with excitement.Having now watched The Pacific, that excitement has transformed to 'eh.'The Pacific surpasses Band of Brothers in one, and only one, aspect of film making; special effects. That's it. Story telling, character development, acting...Band of Brothers is by far the better production. That isn't to say that The Pacific is not good, it is, but I was expecting more...and expecting less sex, and obscene language. Granted, the language present in The Pacific is likely a watered down version of reality. At the same time, I'm watching The Pacific for entertainment, and I don't really enjoy an abundance of obscene language. In the Band of Brothers, obscene language was present, but it was used in a manner that was not distracting. As for the sex...I don't need to see it, and I don't think it adds anything to the story. (I'm a 27 year old man; I'm not a prude. I just enjoy good film making, and I don't think sex or an abundance of obscene language adds anything to films.). Love scenes could have easily been implied, and the film wouldn't have skipped a beat.I also thought the gore was a bit much too. When you see a soldiers leg get blown off several times, or a man attempting to put his guts back in, and the only purpose of the shot is to show that...it's cliche. It's Spielberg pulling from his Saving Private Ryan experience. Obviously, it's war and war is violent; but I thought it distracted from the story a bit.I'm not a historian, so I cannot comment about the accuracy of the film. However, there really isn't much lead up to major battles. In Band of Brothers, there were two episodes that led up to D-Day. Halfway into the first episode of The Pacific, that battle has begun. That sort of sums up the film...nothing really develops, it just happens; and that goes for the characters too.Band of Brothers did an excellent job of character development. Each character had a personality that was uniqe...I cared what happened to the characters. Not so much in The Pacific. They all play sort of a rough and tough role.Overall, I thought The Pacific had good moments, and had some just OK moments. Band of Brothers is by far a better film in my book. I'd give Band of Brothers a 10, and The Pacific a 6.5.",3,Good and Okay,1289520000,"11 12, 2010",2010,2521,"['watched', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'thought', 'hope', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'Pacific', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'best', 'WWII', 'movie', 'book', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'war', 'Pacific', 'When', 'read', 'Pacific', 'was', 'being', 'developed', 'was', 'overwhelmed', 'excitement.Having', 'now', 'watched', 'Pacific', 'excitement', 'transformed', ""'eh"", 'Pacific', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'one', 'only', 'one', 'aspect', 'film', 'making', 'special', 'effects', 'Story', 'telling', 'character', 'development', 'acting', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'far', 'better', 'production', ""n't"", 'say', 'Pacific', 'not', 'good', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'expecting', 'less', 'sex', 'obscene', 'language', 'Granted', 'language', 'present', 'Pacific', 'likely', 'watered', 'down', 'version', 'reality', 'same', 'time', ""'m"", 'watching', 'Pacific', 'entertainment', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'abundance', 'obscene', 'language', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'obscene', 'language', 'was', 'present', 'was', 'used', 'manner', 'was', 'not', 'distracting', 'sex', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'story', ""'m"", '27', 'year', 'old', 'man', ""'m"", 'not', 'prude', 'just', 'enjoy', 'good', 'film', 'making', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'sex', 'abundance', 'obscene', 'language', 'anything', 'films.', 'Love', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'implied', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'skipped', 'beat.I', 'also', 'thought', 'gore', 'was', 'bit', 'much', 'too', 'When', 'see', 'soldiers', 'leg', 'get', 'blown', 'off', 'several', 'times', 'man', 'attempting', 'put', 'guts', 'back', 'only', 'purpose', 'shot', 'show', 'cliche', 'Spielberg', 'pulling', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'experience', 'Obviously', 'war', 'war', 'violent', 'thought', 'distracted', 'story', 'bit.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'historian', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'accuracy', 'film', 'However', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'lead', 'major', 'battles', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'were', 'two', 'episodes', 'led', 'up', 'D-Day', 'Halfway', 'first', 'episode', 'Pacific', 'battle', 'begun', 'sort', 'sums', 'film', 'nothing', 'really', 'just', 'characters', 'too.Band', 'Brothers', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'character', 'development', 'character', 'had', 'personality', 'was', 'uniqe', 'cared', 'what', 'happened', 'characters', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'Pacific', 'play', 'sort', 'rough', 'tough', 'role.Overall', 'thought', 'Pacific', 'had', 'good', 'moments', 'had', 'just', 'OK', 'moments', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'far', 'better', 'film', 'book', ""'d"", 'give', 'Band', 'Brothers', '10', 'Pacific', '6.5']",N/A

1203162,A17S1450Y06C86,B001IBIHQ4,Aidan J. McQuade,"[2, 3]","As with ""Band of Brothers"" I found this series difficult to get into - probably more so because the series immediately pitches into the vicious battle of Guadalcanal and there is little time to get acquainted with the characters. The third episode, set during a moment of respite in Australia, remedies this and from this point I found the series increasingly gripping.The fragmented, and sometimes pointless, nature of the Pacific campaign means that this series is perhaps even more character driven than ""Band of Brothers"" with its Normandy to Germany narrative arc. In some ways this makes it easier to relate to as it focuses principally on just three marines: Leckie, Basilone and Sledge. On the other hand the brutality of the Pacific fighting, the underlying racism of the conflict and the marines culture of taking no prisoners leavens our thinking about these people and poses back to the viewer the uncomfortable question of how we would behave if we had to courage to face similar circumstances.Consequently the series avoids jingoism and mock heroism. The combat sequences are terrifying rather than exciting and the overall tone is sorrowful rather than celebratory.

As you probably know, this 10-part HBO series, produced and narrated by Tom Hanks, follows a small handful of marines through WWII in the Pacific.  The series starts with action at Guadalcanal, continues through the Battle for Iwo Jima, and follows the surviving main characters home after the war.War in the Pacific was a gritty, dirty, and forsaken affair.  Though US Army soldiers were certainly in the majority in that theater of operations, ""The Pacific"" follows the war through the eyes, ears, and lives of US Marines.I very much enjoyed Hanks' earlier project,Band of Brothers, so I was anxious to take a look at ""The Pacific.""""The Pacific"" struck me more as an overall experience than as a series of interlocking stories.  Sure there are different characters, and we see their strengths and weaknesses, but what I walked away with was an overall impression of the terrible conditions that our military personel had to live and fight in.  The fighting was desperate and the typical Japanese soldier early in the war was already a hardened veteran.  Out troops, on the other hand, were committed, but green.  Battle soon changed all of that.You should be aware before you watch that there are MANY gritty battle scenes, including vivid depictions of the gore, terror, and death of battle.  This is not a series for the faint of heart.  This is not viewing for the entire family.  My 17-year old son and I watched a good portion of it together, and he handled it all right, but I will not let my 12-yr old daughter watch it!Once again, I have to say that my overall experience with this series is that it provided me with a glimpse of what it must have been like to serve in the Marines in the Pacific during WWII.

1203183,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B001IBIHQ4,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[2, 3]","August 1942. The United States Marine Corps lands in force on the island of Guadalcanal and begins the long, gruelling campaign of 'island-hopping'. Over the next three years they will take the fight against Japanese forces on islands all across the western Pacific, drawing ever closer to the Japanese home islands and victory.The Pacific is HBO's companion series to their acclaimed 2001 series Band of Brothers. Like the earlier series, The Pacific follows American soldiers across a single theatre of war (albeit a far vaster one). Unlike Band of Brothers, which was able to concentrate on a single company of the 10st Airborne and cover its journey in some detail (the whole series, bar the opening training sequence, only spanned nine months), The Pacific is rather diffuse in its focus. It covers a period of three years and the almost modular nature of the war in the Pacific (multiple major battles raging simultaneously on islands hundreds of miles apart) means it is impossible to focus on one unit throughout the whole war. The series copes with the problem by dividing the narrative into three storylines following three marines (John Basilone, Bob Leckie and Eugene Sledge), but this ultimately proves to be a move with mixed success.Plaudits first. The Pacific is visually stunning. Filmed on location on Australia's Pacific coast, the series employs impressive location filming, practical special effects and CGI enhancements to depict WWII combat on-screen more viscerally and in a more convincing manner even than Band of Brothers. The Pacific really does look and sound like a movie, especially on Blu-Ray, and as an audio/visual experience is always impressive. The lead actors - Joseph Mazzello, James Badge Dale and Jon Seda as Sledge, Leckie and Basilone respectively - are impressive and are lent able support by the likes of William Sadler (as the infamous Colonel 'Chesty' Puller) and Rami Malek, who gives an offbeat but fascinating performance as 'Snafu' Shelton. In terms of direction, production values and acting, the series is overwhelmingly impressive.The issues arise from structural choices for the series. The Pacific War was a very different beast to the Western Front of WWII in Europe, spanning vaster distances and featuring the marines, navy and army fighting simultaneously on different fronts. An immediate drawback of only having ten episodes to tell this story is that other units and services outside the Marine Corps get short shrift. None of the immense naval battles in the theatre (Midway, the Coral Sea etc) are really mentioned and the massive American bombing campaign against Japan is not featured. There are some nods to the other services (the Battle of Savo Island is briefly watched by the marines from the shore; aerial assaults on Japanese positions are occasionally shown) but the focus is squarely on the marines.Even this is problematic. To get across the scale of the conflict, HBO conflates three separate stories together. John Basilone's story allows them to show life on the home front (Basilone was sent home after Guadalcanal, initially serving as a PR representative to raise money for the war and later as a marine instructor before returning to the field during the battle for Iwo Jima), whilst Bob Leckie is used to cover the initial stages of the fighting and also the role of Australia in the conflict. After Leckie is wounded and forced to return home, Eugene Sledge steps up as our principal POV character and we see most of the latter stages of the war through his eyes. This baton-passing approach to the narrative sounds good but ultimately feels disjointed, as the three soldiers' paths never cross (aside a fictitious brief meeting between Sledge and Leckie). It also complicates things by giving us three different sets of supporting characters to also get to know, which is a tall order for just ten episodes.Which isn't to say that what we are left with is still not compelling. The actors do a great job of selling their characters' respective storylines: Leckie is left on the front lines a little too long and begins suffering from battle fatigue; Basilone is tired of being hailed a hero at home whilst his friends are still fighting and is anxious to return to the front; and Sledge is angry at missing out the start of the war due to poor health and is keen to prove himself, only to ultimately start losing perspective as the gruelling months of combat unfold. These are familiar storylines, but are given added depth and weight by being true (all three marines are real, and Leckie and Sledge's memoirs provide the basis for the series).The overwhelming feeling of the series is one of despair. The fighting is savage and without quarter, and the marines often feel that their fighting and dying over specks of land in the middle of nowhere is pointless. There is a lack of any type of grand strategic overview which is true to the experience of the soldiers on the ground. Notably, there is no equivalent to the Why We Fight episode of Band of Brothers (where the 101st liberates a concentration camp and their horrific experiences harden their resolve to help destroy the Nazi regime). The marines are left feeling bereft of a purpose, which makes the horrors they experience strike home even harder. It's no wonder that many of them are shown breaking down or needing urgent time away from the front to reorient themselves. HBO should be congratulated for not downplaying these angles, but it often makes for very hard viewing.The Pacific (****) is ultimately worth watching. It's a stunning production that makes some hard comments about war and its ultimate savagery, even when a war is worth fighting. It doesn't glorify war and shows its horrors in full force, which can make for hard viewing, but the superior acting and writing make it compelling. Structurally the series is disjointed, and would have benefitted from a tighter focus on maybe just one or two of the marines featured. Extending it to three stretches the story almost to breaking point. However, once you adjust to the structural issues the series is an impressive piece of work. It is available now on DVD (UK, USA) and Blu-Ray (UK, USA).",4,"A good series, despite some issues.",1329609600,"02 19, 2012",2012,6207,"['August', '1942', 'United', 'States', 'Marine', 'Corps',

1203184,A1KBT3D1O0LA7L,B001IBIHQ4,A. White,"[1, 1]","Like many of those who have an interest in this era I'm sure; I approached The Pacific with the outstanding Band of Brothers (BoB) series in mind. While The Pacific doesn't quite compare with BoB in a number of ways, primarily due to the difference in source material used, it is still a great rendition of the experiences of Marines during WWII. Instead of getting to know almost everybody involved, as you do in BoB, The Pacific is a convergence of a few biographies/autobiographies by or about three Marines whom the series identifies as the main characters. You do certainly learn the names of other characters, but that's only through the interaction of the focused few.I have had the pleasure of reading one of the books this series was based on, Helmet for My Pillow by Robert Leckie, and although it was an excellent read, making it part of a series like this one may not have been their best choice; due to it being all one person's point of view and not translating well to a non-documentary format in parts. That was one of the many things that made BoB so great IMO; the fact that the information was coming from practically an entire company. Going the route of The Pacific made for a slower, more dramatized experience. I don't mean to imply that as a bad thing, I just want those who haven't seen it to know what to expect.I'm willing to bet that the majority of people interested in war stories care less about watching soldiers spending time at an insane asylum, or becoming a poster-boy to sell war bonds, than they do about seeing the combat and the heroics surrounding it. I'm not saying all the other stuff should be left out, and as a veteran myself I understand very well what goes on 'behind the scenes' as it were, but unlike BoB I felt that there were several scenes that could've been edited to allow for more time on the battlefield, such as Guadalcanal. For example, large sections of parts 3 & 4 felt like filler to me and could've easily been cut down to one chapter; not cutting scenes completely mind you, just made shorter while still getting the point across. Leave those details for readers who prefers to expand on these experiences through the books.Despite all this, I still very much enjoyed The Pacific and admit that most of the criticisms I've made are relatively minor, especially when looking at it under its own merits and not compared to Band of Brothers. I highly recommend watching this series at least once to anyone who are WWII aficionados or simply interested in getting a closer look into the lives of a few Marines during their time across the Pacific.",4,Island Hopping,1373500800,"07 11, 2013",2013,2607,"['many', 'who', 'have', 'interest', 'era', ""'m"", 'sure', 'approached', 'Pacific', 'outstanding', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'BoB', 'series', 'mind', 'Pacific', ""n't"", 'quite', 'compare', 'BoB', 'number', 'ways', 'primarily', 'due', 'difference', 'source', 'material', 'used', 'still', 'great', 'rendition', 'experiences', 'Marines', 'WWII', 'Instead', 'getting', 'know', 'almost', 'everybody', 'involved', 'do', 'BoB', 'Pacific', 'convergence', 'few', 'biographies/autobiographies', 'three', 'Marines', 'whom', 'series', 'main', 'characters', 'do', 'certainly', 'learn', 'names', 'other', 'characters', 'only', 'interaction', 'focused', 'few.I', 'have', 'had', 'pleasure', 'reading', 'one', 'books', 'series', 'was', 'based', 'Helmet', 'My', 'Pillow', 'Robert', 'Leckie', 'was', 'excellent', 'read', 'making', 'part', 'series', 'one', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'choice', 'due', 'being', 'one', 'person', 'point', 'view', 'not', 'translating', 'well', 'non-documentary', 'format', 'parts', 'was', 'one', 'many', 'things', 'made', 'BoB', 'so', 'great', 'IMO', 'fact', 'information', 'was', 'coming', 'practically', 'entire', 'company', 'Going', 'route', 'Pacific', 'made', 'slower', 'more', 'dramatized', 'experience', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'imply', 'bad', 'thing', 'just', 'want', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'know', 'what', 'expect.I', ""'m"", 'willing', 'bet', 'majority', 'people', 'interested', 'war', 'stories', 'care', 'less', 'watching', 'soldiers', 'spending', 'time', 'insane', 'asylum', 'becoming', 'poster-boy', 'sell', 'war', 'bonds', 'do', 'seeing', 'combat', 'heroics', 'surrounding', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'other', 'stuff', 'should', 'be', 'left', 'out', 'veteran', 'understand', 'very', 'well', 'what', 'scenes', 'were', 'BoB', 'felt', 'were', 'several', 'scenes', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'edited', 'allow', 'more', 'time', 'battlefield', 'such', 'Guadalcanal', 'example', 'large', 'sections', 'parts', '3', '4', 'felt', 'filler', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'been', 'cut', 'down', 'one', 'chapter', 'not', 'cutting', 'scenes', 'completely', 'just', 'made', 'shorter', 'still', 'getting', 'point', 'Leave', 'details', 'readers', 'who', 'prefers', 'expand', 'experiences', 'books.Despite', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'Pacific', 'admit', 'most', 'criticisms', ""'ve"", 'made', 'are', 'relatively', 'minor', 'especially', 'when', 'looking', 'own', 'merits', 'not', 'compared', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'series', 'least', 'once', 'anyone', 'who', 'are', 'WWII', 'aficionados', 'simply', 'interested', 'getting', 'closer', 'look', 'lives', 'few', 'Marines', 'time', 'Pacific']",N/A

Frankly, the ones I have read, even from ultra liberal sources, paint the Japanese Imperial Army as fanatical, bloodthirsty, deviant sadistic monsters, and definitely incompetent in military strategy(the repeated ""bonzai charge"" experienced through the war for instance) except later defensive strategies concerning fortifications.  Oh, but modern Japan still hunts wales AND dolphins for food, high price food of course, I suppose its a good thing China is stronger or their pandas would end up on modern japanese quisine as well, like panda sushi or something like that, but let us not forget the whales being hunted by them, still(yum yum?, I think not).NO I WILL NOT PAY BUT ABOUT $35 OR LESS, FOR THIS SERIES ON DVD, I suspect it will go to about $40 in the next two years as a regular price which is probably when I will indeed purchase this along with blue ray BOB(having bought BOB as vhs, then standard dvd), probably haplesssly bundled to BOB, which will help me in the blue ray department by then.I may not purchase this mini series at all, since I feel it was a hard slam against the WW2 American war effort in the Pacific, its definitely not on my ""must have"" list.  I am leaning pretty much toward the ""never will purchase"" side, a sentiment shared by several of my friends and several relatives, not just my humble opinion.",3,"There needed to be more ""shocks""

1203189,A2POYXTGSPSW7O,B001IBIHQ4,Bill Hensler,"[7, 14]","I liked the stories in this movie.  But if you've done any reading on the subject, like Manchester'sGoodbye, Darkness: A Memoir of the Pacific Warthen this is not a new subject.  Indeed, when one looks at the old John Wayne movieSands of Iwo Jimait could be argued that Wayne's movie is better.  That is the rub with this series.  Band of Brothers is one of the best mini-series ever made on HBO and is equal or better than most WWII movies on the subject.  The old movieA Bridge Too Far [Blu-ray] isn't as good as Band of Brothers.  Conversely, John Wayne plays a compelling Marine Sergeant in Sands of Iwo Jima and that movie is better than ""The Pacific"".The movie starts off with Robert Leckie telling a woman in a church that he is off the Marines.  When you read Robert Leckie's bookHelmet for My Pillow: From Parris Island to the Pacificin the first page the thing he really remembers is the Marines forced him to get circumcised before he could enlist and he's complaining about the pain.  The video is a little different than the book, don't you think?  Eugene Sledge is the story is the same way.  In this series we see somebody who is sickly and becomes a Marine.  In the book Mr. Sledge was at a military academy and enlisted in the Marines because he believed that he was going to miss the was if he had stayed at the academy.""The Pacific"" starts off with the Marines being placed on Guadalcanal and the soldiers seeing the sinking of the US Navy Fleet during the Battle of Savo Island (the worst beating the US Navy ever had in a battle).  That was pretty good special effects.  The casual viewer is shown what it's like for the Marines.  Their uniforms were rotting off their bodies.  They ate captured Japanese rice that was infested with maggots.  The Marines endured many Japanese suicide attacks.  It is fairly good but what is missed is the Marines underwent nearly nightly ship bombardments.  The viewer is shown one bombardment that lasts for a minute.  The Marines on Guadalcanal had a Japanese battleship empty its guns on them; one of the few times American service members had to endure a battleship bombardment.I liked the Guadalcanal treatment.  But doing that could have been a whole mini series by itself and an adaptation of the bookGuadalcanal: Starvation Islandwould not get HBO a lot of viewers.I did like the cut away to Australia.  I didn't know that the Marines sent the Marines to Australia to have the men recover from the ordeal at Guadalcanal.  This reminded me of the better parts that the American soldiers had in Europe.  Hats off to the producers for this and a big thumb up.  It sounds like Mr. Leckie's Marines had the time of their life in Australia.  The stories with the women are half true and half fiction.  The fiction is the family stories.  The fact is the women were accomidating to the Marines.Most of the characters meet up at a central location, the island of Pavuvu; the Marine Corps main depot island in the Pacific.  This is a little made up but was done to bring continuity to the story.  In the post mid-1943 period it was logistically easier to have the marines at Pavuvu than ship them back to Australia.  Pavuvu is a nasty little island that is infested with crabs and rats.  But after the Marines are subject to the horrors of miserable islands like Peleliu it's better than nothing.  At least the food is constant and the medical attention is good.At Pavuvu the second groups of characters take over from ""Lucky's"" group of Marines.  This is based off the bookWith the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa.  This is where the series really falls down and falls down hard.  Iwo Jima's set is unconvincing.  The sets are a series of rocky hills that are used and re-used.  A viewer can see that Iwo's set looks like Peleliu 's set looks like Okinawa's set.  This isn't good and it actually starts having a cheap made-for-TV look that half ruined network TV back in the seventies and eighties.  What was HBO thinking?  Also, this reviewer is an equipment geek.  One Amtrack is used in the series and one M-4 Sherman is used.The viewer is really cheated if they think this series captures Okinawa.  Okinawa was nightmarish for all the participants in WWII.  Japanese bombers would attack the fleet at night and the sky would light up with thousands of tracers.  Ships would explode and could be seen from the beach.  Japanese suicide bombers would run under tanks and blow themselves up.  The Army and Marines have different ways of fighting and this causes lots of deaths when the US Army would pull back from a position allowing the Marines to be flanked.I will give any good WWII series three stars.  This is a good series but it hardly touches the surface of what the Marines went through.  Honestly, one is better served by watching Sands of Iwo Jima with John Wayne (link above) or watching this old videoGuadalcanal Diary.I rented ""The Pacific"".  I would not buy it.  It's a good three star rental but the characters are not that compelling.  Boot Camp, a miserable experience for any Marine, is not shown in this series.  The producers try to do too much with too little.  And like putting too little butter on a large piece of bread it just does not work well.And that is the real pity of this video.  Now, the people who like the Navy and the Marines will give this five stars.  But the typical reviewer will only give this three stars and watch it only once or twice.",3,It's O.K. for a mini-series,1289174400,"11 8, 2010",2010,5439,"['liked', 'stories', 'movie', ""'ve"",

1203191,A30TQET02FLSUX,B001IBIHQ4,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[5, 10]","It's been a few months since the final episode of The Pacific miniseries on HBO aired.  I watched all 10 episodes this spring and thoroughly loved them all.  Some were better than others, as is always the case, but as a series, it's right up there with Band of Brothers (2001).  Of course I have to give slightly better marks to Band of Brothers, which is simply one of the best miniseries ever created in my opinion...other than Lonesome Dove (1989), which was my favorite until Band of Brothers.  I think Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, as Producers on both The Pacific and Band of Brothers series, simply understand how to tell great war stories.  Spielberg started this war movie/story fascination of his with his film Empire of the Sun (1987), which I consider to be one of his best movies and the best movie performance in Christian Bale's career.  He continued his powerful war story development with his Oscar-winning film Schindler's List (1993), which to this day is a movie that haunts me and that I can only watch very rarely due to the dark horrors it shows.  And finally the trifecta hit with Saving Private Ryan (1998), which in my opinion was robbed of its Best Picture Oscar, even though I do think Shakespeare in Love (1998) was a terrific movie that year as well.The Pacific was beautifully shot and the production design is outstanding.  The cinematography and editing are top notch.  There was never a doubt in my mind that what I was seeing on the screen was what was probably seen by my Grandfather and the thousands of other soldiers who fought WWII in the Pacific.  My Grandfather was shot on Iwo Jima early in that battle and took his stories from his WWII experience to his grave.  He never really shared that part of his life with his son (my Uncle) or his family.  But watching The Pacific, I feel like I have a small sense of what he must have experienced.What's so interesting to me about this miniseries is the way the episodes unravelled the stories of the 3 main characters.  Some of the episodes were basically just love stories and others were mostly battle scenes filled with death and horror.  But it was all weaved together so wonderfully.  And I was surprised at how I found myself losing track of the time as I watched and got in the shoes of the characters.  I have to say that my favorite episode was actually number 8 entitled ""Iwo Jima"".  And while it has some battle scenes, it's mainly the story of one man meeting this woman he falls in love with and marries.  I just escaped into that episode and was left wanting more at the end.I recently got the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer for this series and it is fantastic! If you like original movie scores, this is one of the best.  Zimmer is definitely my favorite modern movie music composer and he lives up to his incredible body of work with this soundtrack.  I have a feeling I will be revising my Top10 Soundtrack list to include this one at #10 instead of The Insider, which is hard to do...but The Pacific is simply Top10 worthy in my opinion for music scores, so I have to make room somewhere!",4,Almost As Good as Band of Brothers,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,3091,"['been', 'few', 'months', 'final', 'episode', 'Pacific', 'miniseries', 'HBO', 'aired', 'watched', '10', 'episodes', 'spring', 'thoroughly', 'loved', 'were', 'better', 'others', 'always', 'case', 'series', 'right', 'there', 'Band', 'Brothers', '2001', 'course', 'have', 'give', 'slightly', 'better', 'marks', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'simply', 'one', 'best', 'miniseries', 'ever', 'created', 'opinion', 'other', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', '1989', 'was', 'favorite', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'think', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Producers', 'Pacific', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'series', 'simply', 'understand', 'how', 'tell', 'great', 'war', 'stories', 'Spielberg', 'started', 'war', 'movie/story', 'fascination', 'film', 'Empire', 'Sun', '1987', 'consider', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'best', 'movie', 'performance', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'career', 'continued', 'powerful', 'war', 'story', 'development', 'Oscar-winning', 'film', 'Schindler', 'List', '1993', 'day', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'watch', 'very', 'rarely', 'due', 'dark', 'horrors', 'finally', 'trifecta', 'hit', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', '1998', 'opinion', 'was', 'robbed', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'even', 'do', 'think', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', '1998', 'was', 'terrific', 'movie', 'year', 'well.The', 'Pacific', 'was', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'production', 'design', 'outstanding', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'was', 'never', 'doubt', 'mind', 'what', 'was', 'seeing', 'screen', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'probably', 'seen', 'Grandfather', 'thousands', 'other', 'soldiers', 'who', 'fought', 'WWII', 'Pacific', 'Grandfather', 'was', 'shot', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'early', 'battle', 'took', 'stories', 'WWII', 'experience', 'grave', 'never', 'really', 'shared', 'part', 'life', 'son', 'Uncle', 'family', 'watching', 'Pacific', 'feel', 'have', 'small', 'sense', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'so', 'interesting', 'miniseries', 'way', 'episodes', 'unravelled', 'stories', '3', 'main', 'characters', 'episodes', 'were', 'basically', 'just', 'love', 'stories', 'others', 'were', 'mostly', 'battle', 'scenes', 'filled', 'death', 'horror', 'was', 'weaved', 'together', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'found', 'losing', 'track', 'time', 'watched', 'got', 'shoes', 'characters', 'have', 'say', 'favorite', 'episode', 'was', 'actually', 'number', '8', 'entitled', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'battle', 'scenes', 'mainly', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'meeting', 'woman', 'love', 'marries', 'just', 'escaped', 'episode', 'was', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'end.I', 'recently', 'got', 'soundtrack', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'series', 'fantastic', 'like', 'original', 'movie', 'scores', 'one', 'best', 'Zimmer', 'definitely', 'favorite', 'modern', 'movie', 'music', 'composer', 'up', 'incredible', 'body', 'work', 'soundtrack', 'have', 'feeling', 'will', 'be', 'revising', 'Top10', 'Soundtrack', 'list', 'include', 'one', '10', 'instead', 'Insider', 'hard', 'do', 'Pacific', 'simply', 'Top10', 'worthy', 'opinion', 'music', 'scores', 'have', 'make', 'room', 'somewhere']",N/A

Likewise Part 3 and majority of Part 8 directed by Jeremy Podeswa are so ""Grey's Anatomy"" bad it's shocking Spielberg allowed his name in the credits, even as just an Executive Producer. For the record there are some VERY redeemable parts, specifically Part 2 and the last few minutes of Part 8 both directed by David Nutter and featuring Jon Seda as John Basilone, but for me, for the most part the series as a whole just didn't work.One unavoidable reason is the well known fact that the Pacific theater was NOT romantic and therefore will always be a challenge in-and-of-itself to make entertaining. The Japanese (with good reason) were not seen as human and there is NO glory in slaughtering dogs. Also, what few women that make it into the series are so one dimensional and cliche for such a high profile project it's no surprise that the director of their parts (Podeswa) plays for the other team.Ultimately the weak female performances and/or directing limitations of Podeswa and the weak performance of Joseph Mazzello as Eugene Sledge made for a grade too steep to climb.Of interesting note I think if part 2 was released as a stand alone film about Basilone's Medal of Honer actions at Guadalcanal it would be regarded as one of the most entertaining and visceral battle sequences ever put on film.C+ for the effort.",3,"The Good, The Bad and The Completely Unwatchable",1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,1516,"['Reviewing', 'series', 'whole', 'taking', 'account', 'very', 'real', 'limitations', 'time', 'money', 'can', 'say', 'unequivocally', 'EVERY', 'scene', 'Joseph', 'Mazzello', 'Eugene', 'Sledge', 'unwatchable', 'Likewise', 'Part', '3', 'majority', 'Part', '8', 'directed', 'Jeremy', 'Podeswa', 'are', 'so', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'bad', 'shocking', 'Spielberg', 'allowed', 'name', 'credits', 'even', 'just', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'record', 'are', 'VERY', 'redeemable', 'parts', 'specifically', 'Part', '2', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'Part', '8', 'directed', 'David', 'Nutter', 'featuring', 'Jon', 'Seda', 'John', 'Basilone', 'most', 'part', 'series', 'whole', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work.One', 'unavoidable', 'reason', 'well', 'known', 'fact', 'Pacific', 'theater', 'was', 'NOT', 'romantic', 'therefore', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'challenge', 'in-and-of-itself', 'make', 'entertaining', 'Japanese', 'good', 'reason', 'were', 'not', 'seen', 'human', 'glory', 'slaughtering', 'dogs', 'Also', 'what', 'few', 'women', 'make', 'series', 'are', 'so', 'one', 'dimensional', 'cliche', 'high', 'profile', 'project', 'surprise', 'director', 'parts', 'Podeswa', 'other', 'team.Ultimately', 'weak', 'female', 'performances', 'and/or', 'directing', 'limitations', 'Podeswa', 'weak', 'performance', 'Joseph', 'Mazzello', 'Eugene', 'Sledge', 'made', 'grade', 'too', 'steep', 'climb.Of', 'interesting', 'note', 'think', 'part', '2', 'was', 'released', 'stand', 'alone', 'film', 'Basilone', 'Medal', 'Honer', 'actions', 'Guadalcanal', 'would', 'be', 'regarded', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'visceral', 'battle', 'sequences', 'ever', 'put', 'film.C+', 'effort']",N/A

It has the same format, length, and is even packaged the same.  But it doesn't feel the same.  Clearly, the intent was to let the differences between the two theaters of war speak for themselves, and they do.  If the war in Europe was intense and filthy, the war the marines fought on a series of little Pacific islands was even more so, but with less acclaim.  Even today, the war against Japan is more apt to evoke Pearl Harbor and the ensuing naval war than the grinding and miserable experiences of the marines.BoB was based on an exceptional book of the same name by historian Stephen Ambrose.  He had painstakingly dug out the stories of a group of men who had trained and fought together, and wove them into a cohesive account of a single company of the 101st Airborne's experiences in the ETO.  The focus is on the group, and through the magic of film-making, the viewer comes to feel quite attached to the individual men in it.  And while it is not the focus of the story, the devotion of his men as earned by Capt. Winters emerges as an inspiring sub-text.  I have watched BoB several times and believe it is one of the most emotionally satisfying mini-series ever produced.The Pacific is outstanding, too.  But it is largely based on the memoirs of two men, Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie, who did not serve together.  The focus is less on the group than on the common, brutal experience of those who fought in those island campaigns and, frankly, even by the end of the series I did not feel I really knew who the other marines were apart from Sledge and Leckie.  (There is a third, Medal of Honor-winner John Basilone, whose story is followed until his death on Iwo Jima.)The result is a somewhat less cohesive series that, while serving as an honestly told piece of needed history and deserving of great praise, is harder to watch and somehow falls short in terms of dramatic arc.  Ironically, I suspect that the series would have been stronger if it had been based entirely on Sledge's account and the Leckie/Basilone stories had been jettisoned.  Nonetheless, despite these few reservations, the Pacific is a mini-series that can't be missed.",4,"Fine mini-series, but ...",1292284800,"12 14, 2010",2010,2240,"['Pacific', 'masterpiece', 'team', 'created', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'same', 'format', 'length', 'even', 'packaged', 'same', ""n't"", 'feel', 'same', 'Clearly', 'intent', 'was', 'let', 'differences', 'two', 'theaters', 'war', 'speak', 'do', 'war', 'Europe', 'was', 'intense', 'filthy', 'war', 'marines', 'fought', 'series', 'little', 'Pacific', 'islands', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'less', 'acclaim', 'Even', 'today', 'war', 'Japan', 'more', 'apt', 'evoke', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'ensuing', 'naval', 'war', 'grinding', 'miserable', 'experiences', 'marines.BoB', 'was', 'based', 'exceptional', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'historian', 'Stephen', 'Ambrose', 'had', 'painstakingly', 'dug', 'out', 'stories', 'group', 'men', 'who', 'had', 'trained', 'fought', 'together', 'wove', 'cohesive', 'account', 'single', 'company', '101st', 'Airborne', 'experiences', 'ETO', 'focus', 'group', 'magic', 'film-making', 'viewer', 'feel', 'quite', 'attached', 'individual', 'men', 'not', 'focus', 'story', 'devotion', 'men', 'earned', 'Capt', 'Winters', 'inspiring', 'sub-text', 'have', 'watched', 'BoB', 'several', 'times', 'believe', 'one', 'most', 'emotionally', 'satisfying', 'mini-series', 'ever', 'produced.The', 'Pacific', 'outstanding', 'too', 'largely', 'based', 'memoirs', 'two', 'men', 'Eugene', 'Sledge', 'Robert', 'Leckie', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'serve', 'together', 'focus', 'less', 'group', 'common', 'brutal', 'experience', 'who', 'fought', 'island', 'campaigns', 'frankly', 'even', 'end', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'really', 'knew', 'who', 'other', 'marines', 'were', 'apart', 'Sledge', 'Leckie', 'third', 'Medal', 'Honor-winner', 'John', 'Basilone', 'story', 'followed', 'death', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'result', 'somewhat', 'less', 'cohesive', 'series', 'serving', 'honestly', 'told', 'piece', 'needed', 'history', 'deserving', 'great', 'praise', 'harder', 'watch', 'somehow', 'short', 'terms', 'dramatic', 'arc', 'Ironically', 'suspect', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'had', 'been', 'based', 'entirely', 'Sledge', 'account', 'Leckie/Basilone', 'stories', 'had', 'been', 'jettisoned', 'Nonetheless', 'few', 'reservations', 'Pacific', 'mini-series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'missed']",N/A

But really it was working inside of me the whole time until the John Basilone episodes which dropped me deep down the hole. I get why our soldiers still choose to re-enlist leaving loved ones behind because of this miniseries.  It was a hard logical accurate decision.  The Basilones' was the most amazing story in this series, very close to their immigrant roots and possibly grew up hearing about the history of barbarian invasions including the origins of the Black Death that destroyed most of Europe's population made their sacrifice that much more heart-wrenching.  So I would recommend sitting through all ten parts of this series for the episodes focusing on the Basilones as a delivery system for the message of why we keep fighting and we have to finish the war.  The enemy has always been the same.  Without the Basilone story, we just watch boys suffer and die horribly stopping what has already transpired from reaching American shores and destroying the entire planet.  With the Basilone story, the meaning is elevated to the importance of remembering history and that we are the ones who are willing to die not the other side.  They don't want to die to get away with murdering us, they don't want to go to Oz.  I also think it was no accident that just as the single unit of Japanese American soldiers were not sent to the Pacific, that Italian German Americans with narrow Mongolian eyes were sent to the Pacific not because they were suspect Americans but because it matters that the Italians are carrying ancestry from when the Mongolians tried to take Italy from the days of the Roman Empire pre-Plague and that the post-WW2 falsehbood propagated by Germany accusing the Russian cavalry of rape and ruining Germans from looking like Scandinavians is discredited by the American heroes with narrow eyes who fought in the Pacific.  This war is the opposite of pretty initiating mass murder to kill ugly.  The VERY OPPOSITE is true.  Speilberg cast this series accordingly.  I thank the Allied soldiers and the resistance fighters around the world every day for helping to effect a stalemate so that I could grow up in a non combat zone.  I thank the Filipino resistance fighters who fought alongside American soldiers to take back The Philippine Islands and I remember every year when the news of the destructive floods hit the Islands that in their twisted response to the old Chinese saying that tall trees should be used for nothing less than great pillars, that the Japanese stripped Filipino forests and used the wood to make disposable concrete frames and one use chopsticks and every year those unreforested places in the Islands flood and kill people.  EVERY YEAR.

The acting, writing, photography and direction of The Pacific are all superior. The difference is in the details. For example, the view of one of the main characters lying dead on Iwo Jima slowly pans back to show the many other Marines also lying dead or wounded there. When another scene shows another one of the main characters getting off a train, it also shows another Marine with his right arm missing walking close behind him. Perhaps the acting is better partly because the story focuses on only a few Marines during and after the war whereas you never really get to know any of the characters in depth in Band of Brothers.

HBO/Hanks/Spielberg have not discovered new ground here, but certainly have presented it very well. You can learn a lot about life on the home front, what hero's did, said, felt lived and died.The scenery is fantastic - a period piece showing the vintage cars, real tanks, half tracks. The human interest is compelling. Like its predecessors, it shows war as it is - degrading, dehumanizing, brutal and sometimes, absolutely necessary. This mini series cannot nor does it try to show you every event in the Pacific War, but snapshots of what being a Marine was like in some of the hardest fought and bloodiest battles in WW2.

1203235,A1RD1LL5E5JZOT,B001IBIHQ4,"Crookedmouth "":-/""","[0, 0]","""The Pacific"" follows the fortunes of the 1st Marine Division as it fights its way across the north-western Pacific, clearing the Japanese Army from the many tiny islands in the region in what were probably some of the most intense, brutal and physically and mentally sapping batles of the second world war. It is based largely on the memoirs of two of the characters,Robert Leckie's Helmet for my PillowandEugene Sledge's With the Old Breed.The series, which ran during 2010, comprises of ten episodes, and they cover four of the major encounters of the campaign (Guadalcanal, Pelelieu, Iwo Jima and Okinawa) as well as the Division's time in Melbourne. The Pacific proves, conclusively in my opinion, that a) the war movie is not dead and b) it is not necessarily cheapened by the TV series format. Billed as a sister series toBand Of Brothers, and produced by Spielberg and Hanks, it does, of course beg the comparison with its predecessor and with justification; The Pacific displays, gloriously, that impeccable heritage in its vision and execution.The first point of note is the camera work which is magnificent with majestic, sweeping pans to show the wide picture of the battles and urgent, vital close-ups which put the viewer right into the ball-clenching centre of some unspeakably frightening battle scenes. These battles are wonderfully choreographed and if you can imagine the Omaha landing scene fromSaving Private Ryan, reproduced many times over and on a bigger scale, you will have some idea of how these scenes come across. The attention to detail and historical accuracy is jaw-dropping. It would perhaps be a little crass to mention the cost, but it is easy to understand why The Pacific, at $200m, was at the time (and still is?) the most expensive television series ever created by any network. The money was well spent!It is inevitable that a subject such as this will rely heavily on CGI to fill in the historical spaces between actors and props, particularly during the battle scenes. These scenes seem to have a slightly sepia-toned look which may be there, in part, to blur the edge between CGI and live action. It lends a slightly unreal, computer game look to the wider battle scenes (such as the amphibious landings which involved a huge number of ships).The acting is also exemplary. With such a large cast and enormous stage it is difficult to keep track of the characters (at least to begin with) and indeed to recognise them at all in the heat of the battle scenes but the individuals nevertheless come across well and there are some deeply moving performances. One word of criticism is that little attention is paid to the Japanese protagonists. It would clearly be hard to cover all bases equally but for the most part the ""Japs"" are no more than extras to be mown down in enormous swathes. This is of course a reasonably accurate reflection of their role (at least to western eyes) during the war itself but perhaps enough time has passed that a more intimate and sympathetic view would be warranted (see, for instance,Letters from Iwo Jima).One other minor complaint is that the storyline is interrupted by an entire episode set during R&R; in Australia and focusing largely on the characters' amorous relationships with the locals. Obviously this happened in real life and it is of some historical interest but it fractures the flow somewhat. It is tolerable, but a little irritating.In summary this is a sumptuous war drama that will sit proudly, alongside BoB or by itself, as a fitting tribute to the achievements of a dying breed. It is only a shame that we in the UK cannot provide a similar tribute to our own grandfathers.",5,Hell in the Pacific,1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,3669,"['Pacific', 'fortunes', '1st', 'Marine', 'Division', 'way', 'north-western', 'Pacific', 'clearing', 'Japanese', 'Army', 'many', 'tiny', 'islands', 'region', 'what', 'were', 'probably', 'most', 'intense', 'brutal', 'physically', 'mentally', 'sapping', 'batles', 'second', 'world', 'war', 'based', 'largely', 'memoirs', 'two', 'characters', 'Robert', 'Leckie', 'Helmet', 'PillowandEugene', 'Sledge', 'Old', 'Breed.The', 'series', 'ran', '2010', 'comprises', 'ten', 'episodes', 'cover', 'four', 'major', 'encounters', 'campaign', 'Guadalcanal', 'Pelelieu', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'Okinawa', 'as', 'well', 'Division', 'time', 'Melbourne', 'Pacific', 'conclusively', 'opinion', 'war', 'movie', 'not', 'dead', 'b', 'not', 'necessarily', 'cheapened', 'TV', 'series', 'format', 'Billed', 'sister', 'series', 'toBand', 'Brothers', 'produced', 'Spielberg', 'Hanks', 'course', 'beg', 'comparison', 'predecessor', 'justification', 'Pacific', 'displays', 'gloriously', 'impeccable', 'heritage', 'vision', 'execution.The', 'first', 'point', 'note', 'camera', 'work', 'magnificent', 'majestic', 'sweeping', 'pans', 'show', 'wide', 'picture', 'battles', 'urgent', 'vital', 'close-ups', 'put', 'viewer', 'right', 'ball-clenching', 'centre', 'unspeakably', 'frightening', 'battle', 'scenes', 'battles', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'choreographed', 'can', 'imagine', 'Omaha', 'landing', 'scene', 'fromSaving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'reproduced', 'many', 'times', 'bigger', 'scale', 'will', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'scenes', 'come', 'attention', 'detail', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'jaw-dropping', 'would', 'perhaps', 'be', 'little', 'crass', 'mention', 'cost', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'Pacific', '200m', 'was', 'time', 'still', 'most', 'expensive', 'television', 'series', 'ever', 'created', 'network', 'money', 'was', 'well', 'spent', 'inevitable', 'subject', 'such', 'will', 'rely', 'heavily', 'CGI', 'fill', 'historical', 'spaces', 'actors', 'props', 'particularly', 'battle', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'seem', 'have', 'slightly', 'sepia-toned', 'look', 'may', 'be', 'there', 'part', 'blur', 'edge', 'CGI', 'live', 'action', 'slightly', 'unreal', 'computer', 'game', 'look', 'wider', 'battle', 'scenes', 'such', 'amphibious', 'landings', 'involved', 'huge', 'number', 'ships', '.The', 'acting', 'also', 'exemplary', 'large', 'cast', 'enormous', 'stage', 'difficult', 'keep', 'track', 'characters', 'least', 'begin', 'indeed', 'recognise', 'heat', 'battle', 'scenes', 'individuals', 'nevertheless', 'come', 'across', 'well', 'are', 'deeply', 'moving', 'performances', 'One', 'word', 'criticism', 'little', 'attention', 'paid', 'Japanese', 'protagonists', 'would', 'clearly', 'be', 'hard', 'cover', 'bases', 'equally', 'most', 'part', 'Japs', 'are', 'more', 'extras', 'be', 'mown', 'down', 'enormous', 'swathes', 'course', 'reasonably', 'accurate', 'reflection', 'role', 'least', 'western', 'eyes', 'war', 'perhaps', 'enough', 'time', 'passed', 'more', 'intimate', 'sympathetic', 'view', 'would', 'be', 'warranted', 'see', 'instance', 'Letters', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'other', 'minor', 'complaint', 'storyline', 'interrupted', 'entire', 'episode', 'set', 'R', 'R', 'Australia', 'focusing', 'largely', 'characters', 'amorous', 'relationships', 'locals', 'Obviously', 'happened', 'real', 'life', 'historical', 'interest', 'flow', 'somewhat', 'tolerable', 'little', 'irritating.In', 'summary', 'sumptuous', 'war', 'drama', 'will', 'sit', 'proudly', 'alongside', 'BoB', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'achievements', 'dying', 'breed', 'only', 'shame', 'UK', 'can', 'not', 'provide', 'similar', 'tribute', 'own', 'grandfathers']",N/A

Every American should know the history of World War 2, and I believe this series should be a part of that learning process. There is a lot of attention to detail and historical fact that history buffs will appreciate, and the story is told well enough that the average person will understand why American leadership did everything they could to prevent an invasion of the Japanese mainland.The Pacific follows elements of the United States Marine Corps 1st Marine Division across various battles in the Pacific, including Guadalcanal, New Guinea, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. In contrast to Band of Brothers, The Pacific emphasizes character development and spends a good deal of time on this. Since the two theaters of war were very different from each other, you cannot compare the two series accurately beyond that difference in story-telling.The war with the Japanese was intensely psychological in large part due to the environmental conditions, and the Japanese Bushido Code that drove Japanese soldiers to accomplish their duties even by killing themselves in the process. The series does a good job showing the affect of this plus the overall affect of war on the sanity of the Marines. One will quickly understand why Marines did not take many Japanese prisoners of war. The series also does a good job portraying the extreme disadvantage of the Americans in some battles and leaves the viewer wondering how any Marine could have survived.The biggest fault of the series, and the reason for the 4-star rating, is a personal opinion that less time could have been spent on character development while still telling the same story. There is about an episode-and-a-half worth of time that could have been stripped out of the series to provide more time expanding upon the battles. While the character development is extremely important, especially to showing the psychological impact, it was over-done in this series.Short of that, this is a series that I will definitely be purchasing as it becomes available and will be recommending to friends.",4,"Overall, very well done.",1273622400,"05 12, 2010",2010,2188,"['Pacific', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'paying', 'tribute', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'served', 'Pacific', 'theater', 'war', 'World', 'War', '2', 'Every', 'American', 'should', 'know', 'history', 'World', 'War', '2', 'believe', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'part', 'learning', 'process', 'lot', 'attention', 'detail', 'historical', 'fact', 'history', 'buffs', 'will', 'appreciate', 'story', 'told', 'well', 'enough', 'average', 'person', 'will', 'understand', 'why', 'American', 'leadership', 'did', 'everything', 'could', 'prevent', 'invasion', 'Japanese', 'mainland.The', 'Pacific', 'elements', 'United', 'States', 'Marine', 'Corps', '1st', 'Marine', 'Division', 'various', 'battles', 'Pacific', 'including', 'Guadalcanal', 'New', 'Guinea', 'Peleliu', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'Okinawa', 'contrast', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'Pacific', 'character', 'development', 'good', 'deal', 'time', 'two', 'theaters', 'war', 'were', 'very', 'different', 'other', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'two', 'series', 'accurately', 'difference', 'story-telling.The', 'war', 'Japanese', 'was', 'intensely', 'psychological', 'large', 'part', 'due', 'environmental', 'conditions', 'Japanese', 'Bushido', 'Code', 'drove', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'accomplish', 'duties', 'even', 'killing', 'process', 'series', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'affect', 'overall', 'affect', 'war', 'sanity', 'Marines', 'One', 'will', 'quickly', 'understand', 'why', 'Marines', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'many', 'Japanese', 'prisoners', 'war', 'series', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'extreme', 'disadvantage', 'Americans', 'battles', 'viewer', 'wondering', 'how', 'Marine', 'could', 'have', 'survived.The', 'biggest', 'fault', 'series', 'reason', '4-star', 'rating', 'personal', 'opinion', 'less', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'character', 'development', 'still', 'telling', 'same', 'story', 'episode-and-a-half', 'worth', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stripped', 'series', 'provide', 'more', 'time', 'expanding', 'battles', 'character', 'development', 'extremely', 'important', 'especially', 'showing', 'psychological', 'impact', 'was', 'over-done', 'series.Short', 'series', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'purchasing', 'available', 'will', 'be', 'recommending', 'friends']",N/A

1203245,A2BLFCOPSMBOZ9,B001IBIHQ4,Dave Edmiston,"[0, 0]","My family really loved HBO'sBand of Brothers.  That series knocked my socks off.  I was hoping for the same experience with The Pacific.  If I hadn't ever seen Band of Brothers, I probably would have been completely wowed, but I just didn't get the same experience from this series.  I think part of it had to do with the difference in the campaign itself: the Band of Brothers series covered a very linear campaign from basic training, to staging, to invasion, then through the European continent to the conclusion in the east.  But the Pacific theater didn't lend itself to the same linear storyline.  Hopping from island to island posed a challenge, and I'm not certain that this story dealt with it very well.That's OK though.  It was still an amazing series and stands up well on its own.I do have a HUGE gripe though, and that's with the picture quality.  So many of the scenes were just so dark that you couldn't tell what was happening.  We thought that the problem might have been with our TV, so we paused our viewing for a couple of weeks while I tracked down any possible technical problems.  I bought theDigital Video Essentials: HD Basicscalibration disc to see if that would help.  But it was hellishly frustrating and didn't give any results.  Then I replaced themain lampin our DLP TV, which helped some, but I don't think that was really the problem.  I finally tried theDisney WOW: World of Wondercalibration system and am now 100% convinced that I have my TV picture completely dialed in.So we resumed our viewing and now we can finally see most of what's happening in those darkest scenes, but they're still really doggone dark and hard to make out.  I've played those scenes on other TVs and at friends' houses and had the same issue.  So it's not my setup.  The scenes are just too dark.  Period.  And I swear I'm not a picky guy, but I don't need the pain of my wife harping ""huuuhney...we can't see the movie...the TV must be broken"".  It's NOT BROKEN!  It's the movie!!!Anyway, the stories are really great.  Not as great as Band of Brothers, but that's a tough standard to meet and probably not fair.

I loved BOB and I was hopeful this series would be as good or better.  It is not.  It has some very good aspects to it and some compelling stories.  However, it does not have the scope or inspirational qualities of BOB.  There is very much time spent on backstory and the ""homefront"" which is interesting and ""real"" but not compelling viewing.  It seems story was sacrificed for ""realism"" and some of the episodes are boring and/or depressing.  Again I'm sure this is what war was like and it is a perspective we need to have.  However, it is not good cinema.  The war in the Pacific was a brutal ""no prisoners"" sort of war and it was more brutal and nasty than the Western Front in WWII.  Focusing on the problems that created for individual soldiers is necessary to give a true account of the conflict.  I don't see the need to have that issue take up an entire episode.  The Pacific doesn't give you a feel for the broad conflict and at times it felt like the rest of the war didn't exist.  After the first few episodes I no longer looked forward to watching the future episodes.  I recorded the show when it was on HBO so I don't need to buy it but I haven't bothered to rewatch any of them anyway.  Unlike BOB which I have watched and rewatched several times.

1203247,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B001IBIHQ4,David Bower,"[2, 3]","This was a gift from the same person who had given us ""Band of Brothers"" which we have watched many, many times. Having had the experience with that series we approached this one with a certain set of expectations.First off ""The Pacific"" in Blu-ray is superior in both the video and audio to ""Band of Brothers,"" which we have on DVD; I have not seen the Blu-ray version which may balance things out in that department. One of the things we came to appreciate in the Brothers series was the opportunity to get better acquainted with the characters before the action starts. ""The Pacific"" pretty much hits the ground running and one has to scrap around a little more to try and develop a feeling for this set of characters; before the series is over feelings of sympathy and concern will likely have developed for some of them.Having said that the Pacific series moves along at a fast pace and carries one on through the key battles that helped us win the war. One aspect of this movie that set it apart from Brothers was its focus on the horrors and brutality of war and its impact on the Marines who had to fight the Pacific war and the civilian population caught up in the struggle.The mind-numbing stresses provoked by battle produced different results on the different Marines who were faced with the challenges of warfare; the civilians who were also victims of the war suffered unspeakable horrors as warfare waged around them. The common denominator of our shared humanity evoked mixed emotions of sympathy, horror, fear, and dread as the varied casualties of war emerged.The atomic bomb is casually mentioned near the end of Disc 9 with a reference to one bomb that destroyed a city.Also, unlike Brothers, the last disc focuses on the challenges and difficulties faced by veterans as they returned to civilian life after the war; some to sympathetic receptions and some to stony indifference and all levels in between. I suspect it is nearly impossible for those of us who never had to face that sort of challenge to imagine the difficulties in readjusting one's thinking to civilian life.Having lived through the Second World War as a child I vividly remember the fear and loathing that was generated in the minds of Americans at the mention of the Germans and the Japs! The media supported the war effort and no punches were pulled when it came to describing the atrocities being committed by both the Germans and the Japs; fortunately the very worst parts either had not been revealed or were generally unknown.From what I have read and seen it appears there was initially a certain glamour attributed to fighting as a soldier in WW I. Since WW II the glamour of warfare is absent, and in its place is the brutality and horror of combat. This series carries on that tradition with effective conviction. The series has a TV MA rating which means for Mature Audiences only, the same as an R rating for movies; this gives you a clue as to the levels of deadly combat depicted.It is a memorable series, however.",4,Powerful Record of a Terrible Time!,1297900800,"02 17, 2011",2011,3017,"['was', 'gift', 'same', 'person', 'who', 'had', 'given', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'Having', 'had', 'experience', 'series', 'approached', 'one', 'certain', 'set', 'expectations.First', 'Pacific', 'Blu-ray', 'superior', 'video', 'audio', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'have', 'DVD', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'may', 'balance', 'things', 'out', 'department', 'One', 'things', 'came', 'appreciate', 'Brothers', 'series', 'was', 'opportunity', 'get', 'better', 'acquainted', 'characters', 'action', 'Pacific', 'pretty', 'much', 'ground', 'running', 'one', 'scrap', 'around', 'little', 'more', 'try', 'develop', 'feeling', 'set', 'characters', 'series', 'feelings', 'sympathy', 'concern', 'will', 'likely', 'have', 'developed', 'them.Having', 'said', 'Pacific', 'series', 'moves', 'along', 'fast', 'pace', 'one', 'key', 'battles', 'helped', 'win', 'war', 'One', 'aspect', 'movie', 'set', 'apart', 'Brothers', 'was', 'focus', 'horrors', 'brutality', 'war', 'impact', 'Marines', 'who', 'had', 'fight', 'Pacific', 'war', 'civilian', 'population', 'caught', 'up', 'struggle.The', 'mind-numbing', 'stresses', 'provoked', 'battle', 'produced', 'different', 'results', 'different', 'Marines', 'who', 'were', 'faced', 'challenges', 'warfare', 'civilians', 'who', 'were', 'also', 'victims', 'war', 'suffered', 'unspeakable', 'horrors', 'warfare', 'waged', 'common', 'denominator', 'shared', 'humanity', 'evoked', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'sympathy', 'horror', 'fear', 'dread', 'varied', 'casualties', 'war', 'emerged.The', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'casually', 'mentioned', 'end', 'Disc', '9', 'reference', 'one', 'bomb', 'destroyed', 'city.Also', 'Brothers', 'last', 'disc', 'focuses', 'challenges', 'difficulties', 'faced', 'veterans', 'returned', 'civilian', 'life', 'war', 'sympathetic', 'receptions', 'stony', 'indifference', 'levels', 'suspect', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'face', 'sort', 'challenge', 'imagine', 'difficulties', 'readjusting', 'one', 'thinking', 'civilian', 'life.Having', 'lived', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'child', 'vividly', 'remember', 'fear', 'loathing', 'was', 'generated', 'minds', 'Americans', 'mention', 'Germans', 'Japs', 'media', 'supported', 'war', 'effort', 'punches', 'were', 'pulled', 'when', 'came', 'describing', 'atrocities', 'being', 'committed', 'Germans', 'Japs', 'fortunately', 'very', 'worst', 'parts', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'revealed', 'were', 'generally', 'unknown.From', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'seen', 'was', 'initially', 'certain', 'glamour', 'attributed', 'fighting', 'soldier', 'WW', 'WW', 'II', 'glamour', 'warfare', 'absent', 'place', 'brutality', 'horror', 'combat', 'series', 'tradition', 'effective', 'conviction', 'series', 'TV', 'MA', 'rating', 'Mature', 'Audiences', 'only', 'same', 'R', 'rating', 'movies', 'clue', 'levels', 'deadly', 'combat', 'depicted.It', 'memorable', 'series', 'however']",N/A

I received the entire series of ""The Pacific"" one at a time on DVD from NetFlix, and watched it once.I served six years in the Marine Corps, with more than three years of that in the Pacific and Vietnam. My father, a Marine, was killed in combat on Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands in WWII and I grew up infused with pride and honor for him and the United States Marine Corps.I purchased the ""Band of Brothers"" DVD set when it was first offered by Amazon and consider that set one of the best of the best. I have watched that entire series at least seven times and consider it one of the best buys that I have made on Amazon.But, as other people have stated, on this site and others, ""The Pacific"" series falls far short on story development and getting you interested in the people involved in the story. While ""Band of Brothers"" had you involved with the individuals and caring what happened to them, ""The Pacific"" for me had too much CG graphics in lieu of a story, a very disjointed story line, and too much ""soap"" in the series that had little to do with the telling of the war in the Pacific.Only three or four parts of this ""The Pacific"" ten part series held my attention and interest. Many of the disks I received were ""fast-forwarded"" through simply because, I felt, that the action and story on the disk were inaccurate, boring and dumb. I was not basing my opinion on the differences between ""The Pacific"" and ""Band of Brothers,"" which were many, but rather on what held my interest and attention.If ""The Pacific"" series on DVD could be had for around $25.00, I might consider buying it because of the three or four good parts on the series.

The other big problem is every Marine battle in the Pacific was almost exactly the same. There was no diversity of missions. Just one island grind after another against a largely faceless but brutal enemy. That's the truth but it's not very interesting.

A more reasonable comparison would be the vast supply of limp dramas and shallow sitcoms, to which The Pacific shines like a celebratory torch to human spirit and the ability of smart minded film professionals to make quality shows.The Pacific lacks some of the sweeping narrative that holds the story of the 101st Airborne in Band of Brothers together from boot camp through seizing the Eagle's Nest. Perhaps that is inherent in the type of war fought across island chains scattered throughout the namesake ocean. I also felt that the actors of The Pacific are less grounded than those portraying EZ Company. Gone also are the first person mini-interviews that began each episode of Band of Brothers - I wish I could have heard some  anecdotes directly from the Marines who lived through these stories.For all my criticisms however, the scope of this story is as vast as the Pacific. We follow marines as they battle the enemy, the climate and their own internal demons. I could not help but feel that the portrayal of jungle warfare in this show is heavily reflective of the way in which later wars such as Vietnam were covered. Combat felt &#34;icky&#34;, killing the enemy became an amusement in some cases, and the Marines' anti-Japanese bias is far sharper than that shown to Germans or Italians in the European war.This is an important television show and is certainly far superior to the vast majority of what is available via free streaming.

1203259,A30E2YL894IX7Y,B001IBIHQ4,D. Doppes,"[656, 714]","****Spoiler Alert*****This program follows 3 Marine heroes, their comrades and their sacrifice against a fearless enemy. You will feel every emotion as you watch this epic series. There are several scenes that will never leave your mind. This is an accurate depiction of combat in the Pacific theatre. Its very inhumane at times and not always easy to watch. Having said that-its something everyone should see, regardless of your interest in World War 2.  The level of detail and battle sequences are amazing. The amphibious landings and the hell thats thrown at these guys is unthinkable. The fact that the Pacific war isn't covered enough, makes this educational for some and intriguing to everyone. Thanks to Clint Eastwoods great movies(Letters From Iwo Jima, Flags Of Our Fathers) and Speilberg/Hanks -The Pacific, we are starting to get some great coverage in this area.  Of more importance, the men who gave so much are getting the recognition they deserve.I have read some of the other reviews here and I can't understand the anti- reviews. This is not Band Of Brothers Part 2, its not trying to be that series. This series is much more personal. We get to see how bad the fighting was and how it changes these men. This series focuses on 3 marines, instead of a platoon of guys and their leaders.  Band Of Brothers is awesome, everyone knows that. BOB was also 8 years ago and its had its day in the sun. We all have it on dvd and will enjoy it the rest of our lives. I think some people have let the past 8 years of BOB marinate in their minds. Instead of coming into this series with an open mind, people were ready to pick it apart, because they love BOB so much. I think once this set comes out on blu ray and you can spend a weekend enjoying what a great series it is, you will see that it stands on its own. I heard one guy after the first episode say "" its slow, I hope it will pick up"" . The first episode of BOB was boot camp and getting ready for D-day- that was a slow episode, but very enjoyable- just like this episode one. But in this series the marines are already on Guadalcanal and the action has begun in earnest.Makes no sense.One of many aspects I enjoy about The Pacific is the time the soldiers spend away from the battlefield. I think they do a great job showing whats on these guys minds, what they have to fight for and how their fate on the battlefield effects so many. Theres an episode where they are stationed in Australia and you can see how some Aussies can't wait for them to leave. While others fall in love with the soldiers or welcome them into their lives. Its a dynamic of war that is easier to cover in a series this long.The Marines weren't just fighting a fearless, well trained enemy- they were fighting the jungle as well. Which is also well covered in the series. I can't imagine living in these conditions, let alone fighting the Japanese. The diseases and lack of proper supplies killed thousands of soldiers(on both sides), who didn't have the chance to decide their fate on the field.The acting is well done by the 3 main performers portraying Basilone, Leckie and Sledge. The chemistry between Jon Seda(Basilone) and Annie Parrise(Lena) is hard to find. I thought the episode where they meet, fall in love , marry and seperate because of Basilone's Iwo Jima mission was one of the best in the series. It seemed like every episode was better than the previous. It kept getting better. There are many episodes and moments that make this great. The 3 episodes that encompass the Pelieu battle are intense, brutal and realistic for battle. I feel like the brutality and ruthless battle of the Pacific war is captured very well here. This warfare is much different from the European theatre. The Japanese won't surrender when the odds look grim like the Germans did countless times.  It gives the viewer an idea of how savage the fighting in the Pacific would have been. There is a scene where the Marines are trying to cross an airfield- but the Japanese are waiting and ready. The following moments are above what we have seen in Saving Private Ryan for graphic war violence. For a good while its unrelenting. Another moment that will stay with you is when Sledge is on Okinawa- the last battle. He enters a small shelter to find a crying baby. When he looks around he finds a woman close to death. She wants him to kill her to end her pain, even putting his gun to her head. But he is done killing. Its a powerful moment. There are good hearted moments to find too. The episode where the Marines are in Australia is great. And the final episode finds the soldiers trying to make a life for themselves in post war America. Several find love and begin fresh. Leckie(James Dale)who earler in Australia lost love, finds love with the woman he had been writing too throughout the war. Although he never sends the letters- figuring he wouldn't survive the war!  The people who made the Island sets should be given praise too. The battlefields are very realistic.The special features are definatley worth your time. The first section covers several marines with profiles lasting around 10 minutes per marine. Some of the interviews are from several years ago, when they were still alive. Its priceless archival footage of our countries heroes. There is a making of ""The Pacific"" feature that covers all the research that went into making th sets and recreating the battles. Extremely impressive! This is top shelf film making here. The final section covers the reasons for the savagery of both sides in this war. As well as helping some to understand the conflicts of cultures.I would recommend this series to anyone who has an interest in World War 2, film making, great story telling and those who like to feel the spectrum of emotions when watching something this good.",5,Outstanding!

1203278,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B001IBIHQ4,D. S. Thurlow,"[31, 38]","The superb HBO Miniseries ""The Pacific"" is another remarkable collaborative production effort by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. It follows the US Marine Corps through the horrific World War II Pacific battles of Guadalcanal, Cape Gloucester, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa.  Short interludes in Melbourne, Australia; Paris Island; and some stateside hometowns provide a jarring counterpoint to the battle scenes.Comparisons with ""Band of Brothers"" are perhaps inevitable.  ""Band of Brothers"" had the advantage of following a single unit through the war, and was derived primarily from Stephen Ambrose's superb book of the same name.  The narrative thread of ""The Pacific"" is the experience of three individual Marines whose lives are reasonably well documented.  However, their stories overlap minimally, and the ensemble feel and continuity of ""Band of Brothers"" is lacking.  Perhaps in compensation, ""The Pacific"" is a gritty, violent, and painfully graphic presentation of what it was like to be a Marine in the Pacific war.The three Marines featured in the miniseries are meant to be broadly representative of the Corps.  John Basilone is a pre-war Marine who wins the Medal of Honor at Guadalcanal, and is sent home to sell war bonds.  He will fight to return to duty, first as a trainer of new Marines, then as a leader of troops at Iwo Jima.  Robert Leckie joined up after Pearl Harbor and survived the fighting on Guadalcanal before being sent home for wounds suffered at Peleliu.  Eugene Sledge joined up a little later, held out by a medical condition, and would serve ""With the Old Breed"" at Peleliu and Okinawa, as his autobiography puts it.  He carries the narrative to the end of the war, in the mud and carnage of an Okinawan battlefield populated by large numbers of civilians as well as combatants.  A final episode captures the efforts of the survivors to reintegrate back into civilian life.Each episode of ""The Pacific"" opens with a few remarks by surviving veterans and a voice-over narrative by Tom Hanks that connects the episodes.  Every effort appears to have been made to show authentic uniforms, weapons, and equipment.  The individual episodes run less than an hour, but they pack an emotional punch that should be plenty for all but the most hardened viewers.  ""The Pacific"" is highly recommended to those viewers who found ""Band of Brothers"" to be a worthwhile experience.",4,Hell in the Pacific...,1273449600,"05 10, 2010",2010,2403,"['superb', 'HBO', 'Miniseries', 'Pacific', 'remarkable', 'collaborative', 'production', 'effort', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'US', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'horrific', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Pacific', 'battles', 'Guadalcanal', 'Cape', 'Gloucester', 'Peleliu', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'Okinawa', 'Short', 'Melbourne', 'Australia', 'Paris', 'Island', 'stateside', 'hometowns', 'provide', 'jarring', 'counterpoint', 'battle', 'scenes.Comparisons', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'are', 'perhaps', 'inevitable', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'had', 'advantage', 'following', 'single', 'unit', 'war', 'was', 'derived', 'primarily', 'Stephen', 'Ambrose', 'superb', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'narrative', 'thread', 'Pacific', 'experience', 'three', 'individual', 'Marines', 'lives', 'are', 'reasonably', 'well', 'documented', 'However', 'stories', 'overlap', 'minimally', 'ensemble', 'feel', 'continuity', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'lacking', 'Perhaps', 'compensation', 'Pacific', 'gritty', 'violent', 'painfully', 'graphic', 'presentation', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'Marine', 'Pacific', 'war.The', 'three', 'Marines', 'featured', 'miniseries', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'broadly', 'representative', 'Corps', 'John', 'Basilone', 'pre-war', 'Marine', 'who', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'Guadalcanal', 'sent', 'home', 'sell', 'war', 'bonds', 'will', 'fight', 'return', 'duty', 'first', 'trainer', 'new', 'Marines', 'then', 'leader', 'troops', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'Robert', 'Leckie', 'joined', 'up', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'survived', 'fighting', 'Guadalcanal', 'being', 'sent', 'home', 'wounds', 'suffered', 'Peleliu', 'Eugene', 'Sledge', 'joined', 'up', 'little', 'later', 'held', 'out', 'medical', 'condition', 'would', 'serve', 'Old', 'Breed', 'Peleliu', 'Okinawa', 'autobiography', 'narrative', 'end', 'war', 'mud', 'carnage', 'Okinawan', 'battlefield', 'populated', 'large', 'numbers', 'civilians', 'as', 'well', 'combatants', 'final', 'episode', 'efforts', 'survivors', 'reintegrate', 'back', 'civilian', 'life.Each', 'episode', 'Pacific', 'few', 'remarks', 'surviving', 'veterans', 'voice-over', 'narrative', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'episodes', 'effort', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'show', 'authentic', 'uniforms', 'weapons', 'equipment', 'individual', 'episodes', 'run', 'less', 'hour', 'pack', 'emotional', 'punch', 'should', 'be', 'plenty', 'most', 'hardened', 'viewers', 'Pacific', 'highly', 'recommended', 'viewers', 'who', 'found', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'experience']",N/A

It was the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbour that brought the Americans officially into a war that the rest of the world had been waging for over two years and they would not be ready to engage until nearly a year later but yet guess who thinks they won the war? Guess it&#8217;s obvious I&#8217;m not an American. This is not to denigrate the sacrifices made by those who went into battle and never came home again or did so maimed in body and spirit.This series is unique in making the war experience personal. The depiction of war is brutal and the enemy fanatical but it is the personal details that bring the horror of war home to us. Eugene Sledge would not be the first doctor&#8217;s son whose Father tried to keep him away from a war. Their ongoing relationship begins and ends the series. The startling normalcy of life back home is in stark contrast to the experience of the Marines on those small pieces of coral in the vast Pacific. There the jungle, the insects, the critters, and endemic diseases were every bit as much a danger as the enemy. Wars are won and lost on the stomachs of the men who fight them, an army marches on its stomach and cannot survive long without clean water.The first landing contrasts arriving to find troops resting on the beach with the suspenseful march through an eerie and unknown jungle environment. Finding the abandoned enemy camp ups the ante then comes the rain.Several themes seem to be common to all war movies. Inept West Point Educated Lieutenants whose book larnin&#8217; ill equips them for the rigors of battle. Command decisions that squander hundreds and thousands of lives on meaningless objectives. Friendly fire incidents often involving aerial or ship to shore bombardment. Soldiers killed by their comrades because they did something stupid at night. The various manifestations of battle fatigue. The nightmares that last a lifetime after the war.Had I been a veteran don&#8217;t know as I could have sat through this series.

The Pacific principally followed three Marines of the 1st and 5th Marines in the Pacific Theatre through the war from the invasion of Guadacanal up to the ""bloody"" and vicious carnage of the battle for Okinawa.  The series showed some of the horrors of the war from the USMC perspective.  The series is a good example of why we need to honor these veterans and not forget those who perished fighting for their beliefs and countries no matter which side they were on.  This was an extremely crazy period of time where countries were bent upon destroying one another, the good part is this has been placed where it belongs, in the past and we can now live in peace again as allied nations once more (US and Japan).  This series was based on the stories of actual Marines, two of whom were buddies in school in Mobile, Alabama.  There was also a portion concerning GYSGT John Basilone, a Medal of Honor receipient at Guadacanal and later killed at Iwo Jima, he is still revered by Marines and many people in the US to this day. Also mentioned was the late and great LTGen Chesty Puller, an icon of what a Marine Officer is all about.  I felt this series was quite good but not as well done as ""The Band of Brothers.""  I would like to see in the future a couple of series done; one about the US Army Air Corps and their actions over fortress Europe and the other about the US Navy during the battles of the Pacific, their stories need to be told as well. I would strongly recommend this series for anyone who is interested in the War in the Pacific and the role of the USMC.  Be prepared for some very graphic carnage of war. I have always been interested in WW-II because my father an uncle and other cousins all served and these men served and fought in both theatres; one cousin was lost as a pilot on a bombing mission in 1943 MIA, he was very close to my dad and uncle and was an only child, a valedictroian of both his HS and college classes.

It even puts most motion pictures to shame.Pitty it didn't have a script that was of the same value.In fact it failed badly in so many ways that I have no interest in buying the set, regardless of collecting War Movies in general.Comparison with Band of Brothers is unavoidable and also highlights its failiure. In BoB it is Easy Company that is the true central character of the show. We get to know Easy through its fighting men, but the story has a fixed background that we can associate with and character development is easy to follow. In the end you almost feel as part of the unit. In HBO Pacific no paticular unit is followed and instead we get a summary of the Pacific Campaign seen through various (and certainly variously interesting) characters. This means we do not get to follow the same characters all through except in a disjointed way. So all through the show I never felt becoming a part of anything.Then the show does something amazing. It seems to try to cater to everyone? We have episdoes which almost have no place in a War drama like Episode 3 where the brave marines spend an entire episode trying to invade Australian Women. Worse the focus becomes entirely devoted to a single rather boring character, melhancoly and depressed. At the time the show uses this paticular characters memoirs as a base but really if Episode 3 hadn't been there it not only would not have been missed but probably would have been a better show, or better if it had been crammed into 10 minutes before getting back into action. But it was Episode 4 that almost killed all interest in the show for me. Having already suffered from watching Episode 3 then Episode 4 started out o.k. with action at Cape Gloucester where the main enemy is the jungle itself. 10 minutes in and I had forgiven Episode 3. But then the script writers flushed a good start down the toilet and we get to follow our melhancoly lover Lechie to a field hospital where he spends the rest of the Episode in a mental ward in his customary depressed way. Imagine watching BoB and the Bastonge Episodes had focused on Buck recovering from an arse wound rather than what happend in Bastonge and you wouldn't be far off.

It is, of course, the true story of the battle for the Pacific theater from December 8, 1941 on and features the Marine Corps battles against the Japanese for this important stage of World War II.  The writers and directors and actors take great pains to show both sides of the conflict: there is the expected use of expletives and pejoratives against the Japanese, but at the same time there is meaningful time spent with the frightened and sorrowful looks in the eyes of the Marines who are killing the Japanese 'like a turkey shoot' - especially in one scene where the lone surviving Japanese soldier (Yoshi Ando) stands against the marines, wounded and crying until out of pity a Marine shoots to kill him, releasing him from the tragedy of war.  It is a purgative moment.The banks of Australia make for good backgrounds as the Marines land on Guadalcanal and the fighting that follows is played with suspense and then horror.  But all along the progress of the film we are introduced to the personalities of these young kids who were fighting for their homeland.  One image that will remain in the viewer's mind throughout this series is the set of maps of the world behind the de-briefing officer: all of Europe on the Atlantic side  of America is colored red with the Nazi swastika symbol while the Pacific side is covered with the advancing red and yellow fag of the Japanese.  America looks very small in the middle and makes us remember why the country felt so attacked during that particular war.  it is a sobering memory.THE PACIFIC  has a cast of mostly unknown actors (except for star Jon Seda) but with the faces of men like Joshua Biton,  Joseph Mazzelo, Toby Leonard Moore, Jon Bernthal, Tom Budge, James Badge Dale, Ashton Homes and Jacob Pitts among many others theses actors will likely join the ranks of those who played n the similar European front in BAND OF BROTHERS.  From all indication this will be a very heady series and one that will burn in the minds of viewers for a long time.

The War in the Pacific during War World Two had several unique circumstances that set it apart from the European Theater. Many viewers found these circumstances so disorienting that for a moment they thought they were watching a mini-series about Vietnam War and not World War Two.  These people then unjustly give ""The Pacific"" a bad review, citing excessive foul language (more then what was used in Band of Brothers) massive splatter movie gore, and several sex scenes. Some viewers seem to think that movie is insulting to the Marines of the 1st Division that did a lot of fighting, portraying them as dehumanized killing machines that executed prisoners and gunned down civilians.The harsh reality of the situation and history is that ""Pacific"" did accurately portrayal the meat grinder that is Pacific Theater of Operations of World War Two.A common Japanese Soldier of the Imperial Army is more sadistic then an elite Waffen SS storm trooper, combat wise. Imperial Army fanaticism could easily be compared to the fanatics of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, they literal compared American and British soldiers to demons, much like how Islamic fundies refere to America as ""The Great Satan"" and warn if they don't stop American troopers they will rape every woman and child, and majority of Japanese foot soldier bought it hook line and sinker, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of POWs. The common Japanese army soldier had even more distain and revulsion of us then we did of them.Japanese Warrior culture also had a thing called gyokusai, literal meaning ""Glorious Death"", which lead to literally thousands of Japanese soldiers dying in World War I era charges into machine gun area fire. During the Battle of Saipan 22,000 civilians, not soldiers, civilians, committed suicide, and out of the 31,000 combatants that where there, only 900 surrendered.The hideous amount of gore, not just blood but entrails, exposed rips, shredded arms, and even one hallowed out head that one leatherneck casually threw rocks into only adds to the nauseating verisimilitude of what our grandparents went through that tarnished the souls of otherwise good people. Profanity was ramped the ration of soldiers dropping f-bombs in the pacific to soldiers in the Atlantic is easily 5 to 1.Marines are human, meaning they cuss, they bleed, and from time to time the even copulate.

1203313,AV3JZAYAP7GHC,B001IBIHQ4,halda,"[2, 3]","It took some time for me to get as emotionally vested in ""The Pacific"", as opposed to ""Band of Brothers"". Like several have commented, the two series are very different in tone, character arc, story, etc. What I had to realize was that the Pacific War, which this series dramatizes in a very compelling and impactful way, was a very different conflict than the one in Europe.The war in Europe was one of liberation to free millions of people from Nazi rule. Naturally, this lends itself to noble and heroic dramatizations of the conflict. In the Pacific, however, it was a brutal, no-holds-barred war for survival. Those who fought there weren't liberating anyone. Instead it was kill or be killed.That's why ""The Pacific"" resonates much differently with me. These episodes are emotionally devastating, and serve as harsh reminders of what the war was really about. The main characters descend deeper into darkness as the war grows more brutal and costly. The landscape becomes more hellish, going from lush, forbidding jungle to barren wastelands. Morality gets carved away, layer by layer to the point even when the more idealistic seem to turn into killing machines.It was very difficult to sit through this series. And this is just a dramatization, with us sa the viewers at a far, far distance from the time, place and visceral experiences of the war. At the end, I felt sad and exhausted, not very eager to see another film or show about the war any time soon.And because it had this profound effect, I feel that the series is a magnificent piece of television drama, perhaps even a work of art.",5,"Depicts a war of survival, not of liberation",1295913600,"01 25, 2011",2011,1601,"['took', 'time', 'get', 'emotionally', 'vested', 'Pacific', 'opposed', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'several', 'have', 'commented', 'two', 'series', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'tone', 'character', 'arc', 'story', 'etc', 'What', 'had', 'realize', 'was', 'Pacific', 'War', 'series', 'very', 'compelling', 'impactful', 'way', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'conflict', 'one', 'Europe.The', 'war', 'Europe', 'was', 'one', 'liberation', 'free', 'millions', 'people', 'Nazi', 'rule', 'Naturally', 'noble', 'heroic', 'dramatizations', 'conflict', 'Pacific', 'however', 'was', 'brutal', 'no-holds-barred', 'war', 'survival', 'who', 'fought', 'were', ""n't"", 'liberating', 'anyone', 'Instead', 'was', 'kill', 'be', 'killed.That', 'why', 'Pacific', 'much', 'differently', 'episodes', 'are', 'emotionally', 'devastating', 'serve', 'harsh', 'reminders', 'what', 'war', 'was', 'really', 'about', 'main', 'characters', 'descend', 'deeper', 'darkness', 'war', 'more', 'brutal', 'costly', 'landscape', 'more', 'hellish', 'going', 'lush', 'forbidding', 'jungle', 'barren', 'wastelands', 'Morality', 'carved', 'away', 'layer', 'layer', 'point', 'even', 'when', 'more', 'idealistic', 'seem', 'turn', 'killing', 'machines.It', 'was', 'very', 'difficult', 'sit', 'series', 'just', 'dramatization', 'sa', 'viewers', 'far', 'far', 'distance', 'time', 'place', 'visceral', 'experiences', 'war', 'end', 'felt', 'sad', 'exhausted', 'not', 'very', 'eager', 'see', 'film', 'show', 'war', 'time', 'soon.And', 'had', 'profound', 'effect', 'feel', 'series', 'magnificent', 'piece', 'television', 'drama', 'perhaps', 'even', 'work', 'art']",N/A

1203333,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B001IBIHQ4,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 5]","This series is surprising in many ways. This is not and cannot be the official vision of the war in the Pacific against Japan. For one it does not show Pearl Harbor and the battle about entering the war. It is not really historical in that way and it does not reflect at all the racial integration Roosevelt was able to assert and impose in the US armed forces then. The political issue is also avoided that way and not one single black GI appears in that series. The only two blacks seem to be the servants of the doctor in Mobile.The second surprise is the fact that the series follows a set of young men and women who find themselves together in the same Marines corps or unit and fight together all along. Most of them will survive and only one really dies on the screen. It is thus a series about a handful of GIs who survived the war, except one, John Basilone, a hero of the very first battles, without really wanting to be one and realizing the importance of the fight when it was occurring, who got a medal of honor for that heroism then and was sent back to the US to help sell war bonds and train marines but decided to go back and this time play hero as a sergeant and gets killed, seven months after marrying, just before going back to the front, another marines sergeant working in the catering services of the training center to which he was attached.In fact the series, all along, follows these few men from before the war to after the war and the emphasis is contrastive: the romanticism of before the war, particularly Eugene Sledge who nearly did not go because of some physical condition, the horror of the war, and the full resignation and disgust expressed by Eugene after the war: ""We only learned one thing, to kill Japs and I must admit I have become very good at that.""Each episode of the series centers on one character or on one battle or situation. Each chapter thus tries to depict and render one problem, positive or negative. One character who loses his physical and mental sanity and has to be sent to the psychiatric ward of the military hospital and that enables us to discover the squalid horror of such a war on some men who are lost forever and are taken care of, that is to say are more or less forced to go on living in their insanity.Or it is a resting period in Melbourne Australia and the relations these young men entertain with the local population, particularly of course the sexual dimension of these relations, with a particular emphasis on one case which is a real love affair and yet has to be called off because the young marine has to go back to the front and the relation has no guarantee to ever have a sequel.Or it is a battle and each battle insists on one particular element though some come back regularly and repetitively. The battles are nearly always in mud and under rain with the negative sides of this: wet ammunitions for example and living, resting and fighting conditions that have nothing to do with anything physically challenging: it becomes an ordeal, a self-inflicted or at least assumed torturing ""adventure"" (for the positive thinkers) or ""descent to hell"" (for the negative thinkers). But all have in common one point: they can never say and predict that they should or would be alive any minute now and later. Death is the banal condiment of these battles, the salt and sugar of any war.Or it is the battles on Okinawa and hence with some civilians, very few indeed. A baby here next to his dead mother. An old woman who is severely wounded and wants to die and the marine refuses to do it. A mother with her baby running to the soldiers and begging them to take her child and then detonating herself killing as many marines as possible. Then some evanescent band of civilians going in the opposite direction to that of the marines. That's the worst part missing in this series: the local civilians taken in the war against their will and finding themselves between the Japanese forces and the US marines. They definitely do not look liberated in any way since they are not even shown at all.So what is the meaning of the series?It sets the emphasis on the suffering, at times heroic, at times desperate, at times pathetic, at times insane of the marines. It is centered on the marines, the troops that are projected onto the ground from ships and that open up the battle field. The series systematically gives us very gory and repulsive images supposedly depicting the reality of this war for these soldiers or fighters. Corpses, horrible wounds, skeletons here and there in various states of decay, maimed bodies, legs, heads, hands, or whatever other parts of the body missing from the bodies or lying here and there on the path.It emphasizes the discourse the officers, commissioned or not, use to build the resolve and motivation of the simple soldiers who constantly doubt what they are doing. The extremely black humour of these marines, a condition to their mental survival without which there is no survival at all, is developed and presented as the only human way for these men to cope with their announced and practically sure death. Happy will be those who will survive.Happy they say? That's a joke. They will build or rebuild their lives, but will that be happiness with the constant recollection of these hellish days in the Pacific, the un-erasable remembrance of the suffering imposed to them and imposed to the enemy, the un-extinguishable guilty memory of all the killing done that cannot be alleviated by the supposed heroic dimension of the fight. For these individual fighters it was a nightmare and it will always remain a nightmare visiting them every night and every day.So the film is against war, any war. There is no just war. There is no clean war. There is just war and that is a horrible event that should be once and for all banned from human history.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Perfect discourse against all wars: Goya revisited.,1342137600,"07 13,

Gone were the familiar places, people who looked like you and the comforts of civilization.  They were replaced by ""far away places with strange sounding names"" many lacking even the most basic infrastructure.  If you saw civilians, they bore little resemblance to Americans.  You fought a ferocious enemy that operated under a different set of the rules of war.  This resulted in a war where surrender was all but impossible and mercy was never expected.Drawing heavily on the memories of two Marines, Robert Leckie and Eugene B. Sledge, the HBO miniseries looks at this war.  The ten episodes follow one or both of them in battle and in camp from 1942 to 1946.  Battle is brutal, bloody and deadly, camp is boring.  The combination is deadly producing almost unbearable strain on the men.  The camera never flinches giving us a look at the reality of this war.The acting is excellent.

Munson,"[2, 4]","Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, along with a host of excellent directors and actors, have combined to make a mini-series that is sure to be regarded as one of the best-ever.  Similar to its predecessor ""Band of Brothers"", ""The Pacific"" takes a look at the war in the Pacific through the eyes of the Marines who fought there.Three Marines are featured throughout the series: Eugene Sledge (Joseph Mazzello), Robert Leckie (James Badge Dale), and John Basilone (John Seda).  Through the different campaigns fought by these men, the viewer gets a true, authentic, and often horrifying idea of what the war in the Pacific was really like.  Sledge, plagued by a heart murmur, enlisted later than most of his friends, including his long-time buddy Sid Phillips, but he did see action on Pelelieu and Okinawa.  Somewhat introverted and hesitant at first, by the end of the Okinawa campaign, Sledge had turned into an effective killing machine, showing little compassion for the Japanese.  later in life, Sledge wrote ""With the Old Breed at Pelelieu and Okinawa"", largely regarded as one of the best narratives of the Pacific war ever written.Robert Leckie signed up a few weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor.  An aspiring writer, Leckie served on Guadalcanal, Cape Glouster, and Pelelieu before being wounded. While on leave in Australia, he fell in love with a woman named Stella, only to be spurned later by her.  He wrote letters to his neighbor Vera most frequently, and he ended up marrying her.  He also wrote the excellent books ""Helmet for my Pillow"" and ""Strong Men Armed"".John Basilone served as a machine gunner on Guadalcanal.  One night in October, 1942, Basilone single-handedly killed upwards of twenty Japanese while facing constant enemy fire.  He also risked his life by running to the rear for more ammo.  For his actions, John was awarded the Medal of Honor.  He was then sent home to participate in a war bond tour.  But, his heart was still with his fellow Marines.  He managed to persuade his superiors to allow him to go back into combat, and he participated in the Battle of Iwo Jima.Quite simply, this is one of the absolute BEST series I've ever seen.  The acting is top-notch, the battle scenes were painstakingly re-created to provide the utmost in authenticity, and the ""extras"" disc provides information on how the series was made, along with mini-biographies of the major participants.  I've read many books about the war in the Pacific and I've seen many movies, too, but few of them compare to the job that this fine series does in describing the Pacific war.

1203358,AZXUFTJVXJWL0,B001IBIHQ4,John Dynan,"[2, 2]","Following the fortunes of three real US marines in WWII, The Pacific is not Band of Brothers and never would be but the comparison, it seems, is irresistible to many. The theatre is different and so are the issues. The source material is different too, coming, as it does, from books written by two of the main characters.The popularity of The Pacific's predecessor meant that the producers could go one of two ways; capitalise on the theme by running a new series with the same feel or go in an entirely new direction. They chose the latter and while it's not without its faults, it was an admirable decision and the final product is much better than it gets any credit for being.This was always going to be a controversial decision but one I'm glad they made. Those who complain that it is &#34;not Band of Brothers&#34; probably missed the point.The European theatre is easy to understand, with the bad guys led by a man with a bad haircut and an equally bad toothbrush moustache. The Pacific campaign was less so. The result is that it has always been easier to make movies about the European war than the Pacific because there was no one individual who could be an obvious symbol for the enemy.If you need evidence, look at the relative successes of Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line, one a classic war book, the other dreamed up by scriptwriters. One was well received, the other less so.When you can easily pass off the military issues like that, it becomes easier to concentrate on the story. In short, Band of Brothers was more accessible than The Pacific and there is less to challenge the audience.So what is the difference?In my opinion, The Pacific runs a strong anti-war theme right through it. That's not to say that Band of Brothers is pro-war, just that evidence of anti-war themes is less prominently placed.In other forums, this has been interpreted as being politically correct or even pro-Japanese. It is neither. While the series doesn't go into the sickening realms of atrocities, I don't think it is fair to criticize it for not doing so. There are just too many issues to fit into 10 episodes.With a particular emphasis on the terrible personal toll the war extracted, The Pacific succeeds admirably and I suggest that those who criticize it for being shallow or lacking in character development might want to look again.Watch as the happy-go-lucky Bob Leckie starts to suffer the effects of long-term exposure to fear and anxiety. Contrast the devout, idealistic Eugene Sledge with the battle-hardened marine of Okinawa. He even looks older.Physical injuries are one thing; emotional injuries are quite another. PTSD, explained away by doctors as tiredness, was not well understood then and people, it was assumed, would just be able to get along normally once they got home.Clearly, for a man like Eugene Sledge, this was not the case as he struggled to overcome his demons. Unfortunately, I think many people missed this primary message because it was not what they were expecting. Audiences, as a rule, don't like to be challenged too much and this might have been asking more of some people that they were willing or able to give.I challenge anyone to get through the last two episodes, one on the island of Okinawa, the other at home, without feeling that the price of war was too high for many and that war was not what they expected.The basic stories of the three men are tweaked from the books two of them wrote. While some have criticized The Pacific for not exploring the overarching campaign further, I think this would have been a mistake. No individual soldier can be expected to understand the global issues of a campaign like that of the Pacific and combat memoirs usually provide a vignette rather than a strategic analysis.They can only be judged on what they represent and it would be well nigh impossible to cover the campaign in such detail.The acting performances are of a pretty high standard. I found the main characters sympathetically portrayed and very believable although I think the character of SGT John Basilone could have been better done. Whether it was the actor who was at fault or the director is not clear to me but I found him less engaging than the others.The character of Snafu was also not well done, the actor portraying someone who was less like a man struggling with his sanity and more like a dope-smoking hipster.Others along the way; Burgie, Captain Haldane, Bill Leyden, Chuckler and Runner are all likeable in their own was and evidence that character development was not as badly done as some have made out. They are all different and none is the archetypical &#34;marine from central casting&#34;. If that was what people are expecting, they will likely be disappointed.For me, that is one of the great strengths of the series.The Blu-ray edition of the series is well worth the price of admission. It is a very good transfer and the subtleties of the lighting and colour palette can be fully appreciated.For me there is very little missing from the series and, although I bought it without having seen it, I have enjoyed it immensely. It gives a genuinely heart-felt perspective on the terrible price, both physical and psychological, that so many people paid in WWII and so many others.It deserves not to be judged in comparison with Band of Brothers but as a fine achievement in its own right.",4,A fine achievement in its own right,1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,5380,"['Following', 'fortunes', 'three', 'real', 'US', 'marines',

1203359,A98M1UJWF8D92,B001IBIHQ4,"John E. Larsen ""Larso""","[1, 1]","What an astonishing achievement this show is. There are things here I never dreamed I'd see on TV. HBO and all the people behind getting this series made are to be commended.The mini-series covers the experiences of several marines in the war against Japan in WW2. The war memoirs of Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie form the basis of the screenplay, with several other marines, in particular John Basilone, featured to varying degrees. The common thread is their service in the 1st Marine Division but the men concerned served with different sub-units and in different campaigns (and John Basilone was with the 4th Division for Iwo Jima). Accordingly the series doesn't have the cohesion that was attained in covering the exploits of Easy Company in Band of Brothers. I didn't mind this though. The war in the Pacific was a wide ranging one and its events took place over a much longer time frame than its predecessor was concerned with.The stand-out feature of The Pacific are the battle scenes. They are grisly, loud and confronting. I never thought I'd see war carnage as graphic as this on TV. The makers have also, across the four campaigns, Guadalcanal, Cape Glouster (on Bouganville), Peleliu and Okinawa shown the battles quite differently. These take into account the different types of actions, tactics and conditions on each island. Each campaign also sees an increase in brutality and this allows the deterioration of the men, particularly Sledge, to be shown to vivid effect. Indeed by the end, the men are sick of war and killing, sick of each other and simply sick. It is a long way from the comraderie of Easy Co.While I want to concentrate my review on The Pacific, the relationship to Band of Brothers needs to be addressed. I have read many people say The Pacific is not as good. Certainly it has no character as compelling as Dick Winters. I think it is also clear that `Brothers' is more enjoyable but it is in this that the strength of The Pacific lies. It is a far grimmer, visceral and more shocking portrayal of war. On this and several other points, I think The Pacific is more personal and more powerful.This is a show for adults. Aside from very graphic war violence, there is profane language and sex scenes and concepts. The most confronting element though is the descent into darkness, culminating on Okinawa, where the basic humanity of the characters frays to a thread.

BOB seemed to be on a grander scale with a bigger cast & couldn't have been better. But I liked The Pacific by just a bit. It informed me to a greater extent. Since we are so Euro-centric the war in Europe has been covered much more extensively. The war of the elite paratroopers carries it. The Pacific has fewer main characters, just battle weary leathernecks & a Medal of Honor recipient. It follows them from just before Pearl Harbor to a difficult integration back into civilian life for one of them. The usual campaigns we have all heard of are covered: Iwo Jima, Okinawa & Guadalcanal (especially Guadalcanal). Other battle-grounds less known to history such as Cape Gloucester & Peleliu are also highlighted. Viewing via dvd is a good choice as you can view it at your own speed & have a copy easily accessible to make your own. The acting is uniformly excellent. The extended scenes away from the carnage,  on leave & at home are a welcome respite from the carnage & make it more than just another docu-drama. The Japanese were not the only enemy. There are effective scenes of unremitting jungle rain, the heat, disease & mud, mud, mud everywhere. all the while enduring deadly sniper fire. The set pieces are of course the all out butchery of  battles in which civilians were often caught between. Realistic? It sure seems so. Hanks & Spielberg did a good job without an day of military service between them. As it was then & every war since, civilians just don't get it.

1203362,A126JVOAOOR42V,B001IBIHQ4,John McConnell,"[3, 3]","As a former US Marine, I am always skeptical of war films purporting to be about Marines. Marines have a way of thinking and acting that is hard for actors - (for anyone) - to grasp. If you're a Marine or former Marine watching some actor botch up his role as a ""Marine"" it ruins your experience of a film. Case in point: Eastwood was fine in Heartbreak Ridge but the actors with him resembled US Marines as much as they did small brown furry creatures from Alpha Centauri.Pacific, however, does not suffer from that weakness. These actors were subjected to a nine-day ""boot camp"" before filming. Who ever ""trained"" them did a stellar job. These guys talk, walk, and act like Marines. The weakness the film *does* suffer from is lack of cohesion. Perhaps even a cinematic genius like Spielberg couldn't figure out how to get around a loose story line with battles fought all over the Pacific. Another weakness is the depiction of the Guadalcanal fire fight that occasioned John Basilone's receipt of the Medal of Honor. That fight as filmed needed hundreds more assaulting Japanese; as portrayed, it seems merely like a hellish-tough skirmish. I also found the episode devoted to John Basilone's romance tiresome. I don't know why, I just did.Those are the only cons (for me). The idea this film somehow is ""anti-American"" --- (same critique was leveled at Saving Private Ryan) --- seems to me an inaccurate cavil. Clearly the WWII Pacific US Marine veterans who met with the actors during this film's producation did not regard it so; rather, they viewed it as an honor to their service. Marines pride themselves on fairness when fairness is called for, and mercilessness when mercilessness is called for. In the Pacific, mercilessness was called for.The pros are the film is historically accurate, has immense detail, portrays the Corps accurately, and is enjoyable/impressive to watch. My favorite episodes deal with the horrific fighting on Okinawa. Eugene Sledge remarked of that fighting, (roughly quoted): ""It was beyond ludicrous that anyone could endure those conditions for long and not go completely insane"".The series is built around three Marines - John ""I'm staying with my boys"" Basilone, Robert Leckie, and Eugene Sledge - and the historical memoirs of the latter two:Helmet for My PillowandWith the Old Breed.If you are a Marine, Marine veteran, a Marine family member, or just interested in increasing your vicarious first hand knowledge of the Pacific War, this is a graphic, realistic film I believe you will appreciate.",4,Fine film,1353196800,"11 18, 2012",2012,2540,"['former', 'US', 'Marine', 'am', 'always', 'skeptical', 'war', 'films', 'purporting', 'be', 'Marines', 'Marines', 'have', 'way', 'thinking', 'acting', 'hard', 'actors', 'anyone', 'grasp', ""'re"", 'Marine', 'former', 'Marine', 'watching', 'actor', 'botch', 'up', 'role', 'Marine', 'experience', 'film', 'Case', 'point', 'Eastwood', 'was', 'fine', 'Heartbreak', 'Ridge', 'actors', 'resembled', 'US', 'Marines', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'small', 'brown', 'furry', 'creatures', 'Alpha', 'Centauri.Pacific', 'however', 'not', 'suffer', 'weakness', 'actors', 'were', 'subjected', 'nine-day', 'boot', 'camp', 'filming', 'Who', 'ever', 'trained', 'did', 'stellar', 'job', 'guys', 'talk', 'walk', 'act', 'Marines', 'weakness', 'film', '*does*', 'suffer', 'lack', 'cohesion', 'Perhaps', 'even', 'cinematic', 'genius', 'Spielberg', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'loose', 'story', 'line', 'battles', 'fought', 'Pacific', 'weakness', 'depiction', 'Guadalcanal', 'fire', 'fight', 'occasioned', 'John', 'Basilone', 'receipt', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'fight', 'filmed', 'needed', 'hundreds', 'more', 'assaulting', 'Japanese', 'portrayed', 'merely', 'hellish-tough', 'skirmish', 'also', 'found', 'episode', 'devoted', 'John', 'Basilone', 'romance', 'tiresome', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'just', 'did.Those', 'are', 'only', 'cons', 'idea', 'film', 'somehow', 'anti-American', 'same', 'critique', 'was', 'leveled', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'inaccurate', 'cavil', 'Clearly', 'WWII', 'Pacific', 'US', 'Marine', 'veterans', 'who', 'met', 'actors', 'film', 'producation', 'did', 'not', 'regard', 'so', 'rather', 'viewed', 'honor', 'service', 'Marines', 'pride', 'fairness', 'when', 'fairness', 'called', 'mercilessness', 'when', 'mercilessness', 'called', 'Pacific', 'mercilessness', 'was', 'called', 'for.The', 'pros', 'are', 'film', 'historically', 'accurate', 'immense', 'detail', 'Corps', 'accurately', 'enjoyable/impressive', 'watch', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'deal', 'horrific', 'fighting', 'Okinawa', 'Eugene', 'Sledge', 'remarked', 'fighting', 'roughly', 'quoted', 'was', 'ludicrous', 'anyone', 'could', 'endure', 'conditions', 'long', 'not', 'go', 'completely', 'insane', '.The', 'series', 'built', 'three', 'Marines', 'John', ""'m"", 'staying', 'boys', 'Basilone', 'Robert', 'Leckie', 'Eugene', 'Sledge', 'historical', 'memoirs', 'latter', 'two', 'Helmet', 'My', 'PillowandWith', 'Old', 'Breed.If', 'are', 'Marine', 'Marine', 'veteran', 'Marine', 'family', 'member', 'just', 'interested', 'increasing', 'vicarious', 'first', 'hand', 'knowledge', 'Pacific', 'War', 'graphic', 'realistic', 'film', 'believe', 'will', 'appreciate']",N/A

When I heard that they were going to make it about the Marine Corps in World War II I was elated! The Pacific Theater of Operations is the bastard son of the U.S. military involvement of World War II, and I'm glad it's starting to receive the just treatment it deserves. My grandfather served in the U.S. Navy from 1944-46 and took part in the invasion of the Philippines and other engagements; he would often tell me that he enlisted in the Navy to avoid having his guts splattered all over the Pacific like the Marines so often did. He always kept his inner-service rivalry with the Corps, but he shielded a deep and ultimate respect for the men who fought and bled on those forgotten islands of the Pacific Theater; and would be elated that his sacrifice, as well as millions more Americans are now being brought to the forefront.&#34;The Pacific&#34; does an absolutely terrific job of bringing the horrors of hitting the beaches of the Pacific, as well as the sheer terror of surviving a cunning enemy entrenched in the jungle willing to fight to the absolute death. The Japanese soldier was often portrayed in Hollywood as nothing more than a bucktooth, inferior subhuman being that could never stand up to the military know-how of the Euro/American militaries of the day. However, I'm sure that anybody that fought the Japanese army during World War II would ultimately disagree. At one time during the show, the actor playing John Basilone harshly corrects a new Marine that only wants to &#34;Slap a Jap&#34; by informing him of the dedication and ferocity with which the Japanese soldier fought and died on Guadalcanal. The mini-series does a magnificent job of bringing the bitterness and harshness of the Pacific to light; the combat scenes explain in detail just how tough a man had to be to deal with the constant state of fear and anxiety that accompanies war.While many have complained that the character development of the series lacks at best, or at least that it's not &#34;Band of Brothers,&#34; I enjoyed just about every character and their roles. My biggest complaint with the mini-series is the portrayal of Eugene Sledge. I'm not sure why, but Joseph Mazzello never grabbed me and made me want to like his character. I felt that his part was contrived and often overblown, and by the end of the show you feel as though he was nothing short of a raving lunatic. Now I know combat fatigue would have caused men to do horrific things, but the way Mazzello played his part just never drew me in. Other than that minor gripe I felt the show was addicting and a worthy addition to any fan of World War II movies or history. To be totally honest, I'd have kept watching if they would have kept making.

John Basilone in Camp Pendleton, as he's training his recruits, in response to one of them saying ""I'm sick of this training.  I want to Slap a Jap!""  He's trying to prepare his naive boys for doing combat against the vicious, brutal, fanatical Japanese soldier of WW2.  He killed many Japanese soldiers on Guadacanal, which was a true fight to the death, but he certainly did NOT take their skill and fanaticism lightly.The rest of his angry speech goes, ""He (the Japanese soldier) is a combat veteran, and an expert with his weapon. He can live off of maggoty rice and muddy water and endure misery YOU COULDN'T DREAM UP (in soldier's face) in your WORST NIGHTMARE! The Japanese soldier doesn't care if he gets hurt or killed, as long as he kills you. Now you can call them whatever you want but never, ever, fail to respect their desire to put you and your buddies into an early GRAVE!! IS THAT CLEAR?!""So to me, this speech epitomizes The Pacific..... Gritty! TRUTHFUL! NON-PC!!! Brutally honest!  The Pacific follows 3 Marines from training, through Guadacanal, through Cape Gloucaster, Peliliu, Iwo Jima and Okinawa.  They were Eugene Sledge, Robert Leckie and John Basilone.  They all weren't together at the same time and they didn't fight in the same battles, but their lives cris-crossed over 4 years.  Sledge made it through 2 huge battles (Pelilu & Okinawa) without injury, but returned hardened, angry and horrified at the nastiness of war.  Basilone did amazing things on Guadacanal and Iwo Jima before he died.  And Leckie made it through Guadacanal and Cape Gloucester (being temporarily sidelined for mental fatigue), before being severely wounded on Peliliu.If you're a fan of reality, if you think that war is too glorified in movies and want a more truthful presentation, if you want to get insight on why the Marines hated the Japanese and took virtually no prisoners, if you want to get some insight into the bitter feeling of the Pacific Campaign and the misery of jungle warfare, then watch this series.  I highly recommend it!  What the Marines did in Guadacanal was amazing and surely turned the tide of the Pacific War, along with Midway.  The series makes this point very clear that they were out-manned, had the Japanese air and ship forces lined up against them, and they still won.  It was truly remarkable that they could inflict huge losses on the Japanese, with their WWI legacy weapons (still using bolt-action rifles!  But also BARs,  and 30-cal machine guns).  What they did on the other islands was no less amazing, for their sacrifice and guts to accomplish a very, very dirty, sacrificial and brutal job.I loved the interviews with the real soldiers as old men, reminiscing.  They were American teenagers, trained by the Marines, sent off to fight the veteran, brutal Japanese soldier, and they couldn't have done a better job.  But they became brutal & savage in doing so, in order to survive.  In the movie on several occasions they wonder out loud, why the Japanese, being hopeless outnumbered & wounded, wouldn't surrender.  By the end of the war they didn't wonder any more, they just understood it and knew that the Japanese would have to be all killed in order to win the confict.  It's an extremely sobering thought, and bears greatly upon the US decision to go to extreme tactics of firebombing cities and using the 2 atomic bombs.Then the Marines somehow regained their humanity and returned to the US, and picked up their lives again as civilians.  ""The Pacific"" details this very well, and gives you an amazingly realistic feeling that you are there in 42-45, in the jungle, watching real Marines in war, and yet all the time realizing their humanity.  It also shows their relationships with the women of their lives.  It's heart-breaking that Basilone stopped fooling around, married, was very happy, but tragically re-enlisted.  His luck then ran out as he died and left his bride behind after less than 1 year of married life.  But his presence on Iwo Jima surely helped to win that bloody battle and save others' lives.  He gave the ultimate sacrifice.It's thought-provoking to think that after the Japanese had the military brutality burned out of them by the war, suffering what must have been an unimaginably bitter defeat, with millions of them killed, that they are now among the most polite, peaceful and civilized people in the world.  This is another sobering paradox to contemplate.  I recommend that you watch the Pacific as you try to understand how normal people deal with the brutality of war.",5,"""The Jap I Know, the Japanese SOLDIER, has been at war since you were in F****G DIAPERS!""",1302739200,"04 14, 2011",2011,4596,"['quote', 'Gunnery', 'Sgt', 'John', 'Basilone', 'Camp', 'Pendleton', 'training', 'recruits', 'response', 'one', 'saying', ""'m"", 'sick', 'training', 'want', 'Slap', 'Jap', 'trying', 'prepare', 'naive', 'boys', 'doing', 'combat', 'vicious', 'brutal', 'fanatical', 'Japanese', 'soldier', 'WW2', 'killed', 'many', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'Guadacanal', 'was', 'true', 'fight', 'death', 'certainly', 'did', 'NOT', 'take', 'skill', 'fanaticism', 'lightly.The', 'rest', 'angry', 'speech', 'Japanese', 'soldier', 'combat', 'veteran', 'expert', 'weapon', 'can', 'live', 'maggoty', 'rice', 'muddy', 'water', 'endure', 'misery', 'YOU', 'COULD', ""N'T"", 'DREAM', 'UP', 'soldier', 'face', 'WORST', 'NIGHTMARE', 'Japanese', 'soldier', ""n't"", 'care', 'hurt', 'killed', 'as', 'long', 'Now', 'can', 'call', 'want', 'never', 'ever', 'fail', 'respect', 'desire', 'put', 'buddies', 'early', 'GRAVE', 'CLEAR', 'So', 'speech', 'Pacific', 'Gritty', 'TRUTHFUL', 'NON-PC', 'Brutally', 'honest', 'Pacific', '3', 'Marines', 'training', 'Guadacanal', 'Cape', 'Gloucaster', 'Peliliu', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'Okinawa', 'were', 'Eugene', 'Sledge', 'Robert', 'Leckie', 'John', 'Basilone', 'were', ""n't"", 'together', 'same', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'fight', 'same', 'battles', 'lives', 'cris-crossed', '4', 'years', 'Sledge', 'made', '2', 'huge', 'battles', 'Pelilu', 'Okinawa', 'injury', 'returned', 'hardened', 'angry', 'horrified', 'nastiness', 'war', 'Basilone', 'did', 'amazing', 'things', 'Guadacanal', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'died', 'Leckie', 'made', 'Guadacanal', 'Cape', 'Gloucester', 'being', 'temporarily', 'sidelined', 'mental', 'fatigue', 'being', 'severely', 'wounded', 'Peliliu.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'reality', 'think', 'war', 'too', 'glorified', 'movies', 'want', 'more', 'truthful', 'presentation', 'want', 'get', 'insight', 'why', 'Marines', 'hated', 'Japanese', 'took', 'virtually', 'prisoners', 'want', 'get', 'insight', 'bitter', 'feeling', 'Pacific', 'Campaign', 'misery', 'jungle', 'warfare', 'then', 'watch', 'series', 'highly', 'recommend', 'What', 'Marines', 'did', 'Guadacanal', 'was', 'amazing', 'surely', 'turned', 'tide', 'Pacific', 'War', 'Midway', 'series', 'point', 'very', 'clear', 'were', 'out-manned', 'had', 'Japanese', 'air', 'ship', 'forces', 'lined', 'up', 'still', 'won', 'was', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'could', 'inflict', 'huge', 'losses', 'Japanese', 'WWI', 'legacy', 'weapons', 'still', 'using', 'bolt-action', 'rifles', 'also', 'BARs', '30-cal', 'machine', 'guns', 'What', 'did', 'other', 'islands', 'was', 'less', 'amazing', 'sacrifice', 'guts', 'accomplish', 'very', 'very', 'dirty', 'sacrificial', 'brutal', 'job.I', 'loved', 'interviews', 'real', 'soldiers', 'old', 'men', 'reminiscing', 'were', 'American', 'teenagers', 'trained', 'Marines', 'sent', 'off', 'fight', 'veteran', 'brutal', 'Japanese', 'soldier', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'became', 'brutal', 'savage', 'doing', 'so', 'order', 'survive', 'movie', 'several', 'occasions', 'wonder', 'out', 'loud', 'why', 'Japanese', 'being', 'hopeless', 'outnumbered', 'wounded', 'would', ""n't"", 'surrender', 'end', 'war', 'did', ""n't"", 'wonder', 'more', 'just', 'understood', 'knew', 'Japanese', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'killed', 'order', 'win', 'confict', 'extremely', 'sobering', 'thought', 'bears', 'greatly', 'US', 'decision', 'go', 'extreme', 'tactics', 'firebombing', 'cities', 'using', '2', 'atomic', 'bombs.Then', 'Marines', 'somehow', 'regained', 'humanity', 'returned', 'US', 'picked', 'up', 'lives', 'again', 'civilians', 'Pacific', 'details', 'very', 'well', 'amazingly', 'realistic', 'feeling', 'are', 'there', '42-45', 'jungle', 'watching', 'real', 'Marines', 'war', 'yet', 'time', 'realizing', 'humanity', 'also', 'relationships', 'women', 'lives', 'heart-breaking', 'Basilone', 'stopped', 'fooling', 'around', 'married', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'tragically', 're-enlisted', 'luck', 'then', 'ran', 'out', 'died', 'left', 'bride', 'less', '1', 'year', 'married', 'life', 'presence', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'surely', 'helped', 'win', 'bloody', 'battle', 'save', 'others', 'lives', 'gave', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice.It', 'thought-provoking', 'think', 'Japanese', 'had', 'military', 'brutality', 'burned', 'war', 'suffering', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'unimaginably', 'bitter', 'defeat', 'millions', 'killed', 'are', 'now', 'most', 'polite', 'peaceful', 'civilized', 'people', 'world', 'sobering', 'paradox', 'contemplate', 'recommend', 'watch', 'Pacific', 'try', 'understand', 'how', 'normal', 'people', 'deal', 'brutality', 'war']",N/A

1203372,A1U7R3ARZUHQ3C,B001IBIHQ4,J. Slavitt,"[27, 54]","The original book written in typical Ambrose style -- the father started it and his son finished after his death -- tackles the enormous theatre of battle in the Pacific during World War II, obviously through American eyes for the most part.  Like most Ambrose books, it's a compilation of vignettes of different service personnel who fought in various conflicts throughout the war.  Shockingly -- given their reputations -- you have to wonder if Hanks/Spielberg actually read the book before having the screen play developed.  Because ""The Pacific"" the miniseries might as well be a remake named ""Band of Brothers II, How the Marines Won the Pacific War"". There's no question that the Marines did one amazing job at a time when it seemed as if the Japanese were invincible and America barely had enough equipment and decent leadership to get into the fight -- early American military leaders were appallingly bad, simply attrocious and American losses were tragic in the early stages of the war.  Moreover, our service personnel not only had to overcome bad leadership, they also had to deal with massive interservice squabbling and egos and outrageously outdated tactics and equipment.  That said, while the Marines were key to winning the war, the book at least does what the miniseries never does: It spends some time describing the significant role played by our naval personnel, the Army and our Navy and Army pilots in winning the war (i.e. just exactly how did all those marine AND ARMY divisions actually get to those islands? and how did we manage to subdue one of the largest airforces in the world at the time?). With the book, there is some sense of scope and an acknowledgement that our victory in the Pacific was just as much a massive logistical feat as it was a victory of American boys from every walk of life and just about every ethnic background (except the interned Japanese Americans) over a highly trained, very seasoned adversary, that was better equiped in just about every way, at least in the early stages of the conflict.  Instead the miniseries fixates on about four major island engagements and Hanks/Spielberg seem even more determined to turn this into a kind of ""Hills Are Alive Meets Saving Private Ryan"".  Bodies explode.  Skeletons are dug up, there's an amazing amount of blood and gore.  Yes it happened that way, but we are talking about a movie here so you if you know how to direct you can get the point across without exploding mellons, sausages and ketchup at every turn...  More to the point, as if duh, Hanks/Spielberg literally fixate on the copious amounts of sex that occured as young men about to leave home, perhaps for the last time, found women willing to give them a just send off -- we get it.  We know.  We just don't need all the gratuitous nudity and humping that goes with it.  In this regard, Hanks/Spielberg owe the Australians an apology for they way they are portrayed in the miniseries -- simply awful.  Moreover, you can't watch this movie with your kids, which is a real shame because the Pacific region was, is and will be a signficant part of the American story and the Ambrose family did a fairly diligent job of describing a piece of our history in the book.  But add the blood and guts to the sex and chunks of missing history and you've got nothing to do but continue to shield your children's eyes from one section of the miniseries to the next.  I'm almost tempted to send it back to Amazon and get my money back.

I got it because I loved Band of Brothers and expected this would be just as good.  It didn't disappoint.  The production values are amazing, the actors are great and the suffering of war is tangible.There are scenes that remind me of Band of Brothers, even some of the dialogue is the same, and I actually liked the familiarity.  I appreciated the fear and the suffering and the savagery of war.  Spielberg and Hanks are very good at picking writers and directors and the ones on The Pacific really come through with a fine story.There is some political correctness which some viewers might not appreciate.  The Japanese are not seen that often, but there is one scene where a Marine medal of honor winner praises them as determined warriors, etc.  In truth, they were not.  One only needs to watch a documentary on the Bataan Death March to know what kind of warriors they were, not to mention the cowardly sneak attack on Pearl Harbor.  But that stuff aside, it really is a good miniseries.Compared to Band of Brothers, it doesn't hold up as well.  Band of Brothers takes the viewer from training to D-Day to the German surrender (amazing scenes there) and on to VE-Day, and what happens to everybody afterwards.  The Pacific doesn't do that.  So that was the only thing that disappointed me.  I was hoping for the same kind of set-up.I did learn a tremendous amount about what the war was like in the Pacific, thanks to the Spielberg/Hanks meticulous attention to detail.One other important point:  You have a choice on viewing options.  You can choose to play each episode with ""historical background.""  Choose that option.  You will be glad you did because before the segment starts, you will hear from actual Marines who were there, just like in Band of Brothers where you heard from Dick Winters and the others.  This is the best part of the series.  Hearing directly from the actual Marines is humbling and enlightening.  It makes you grateful to the men and women who made it possible to continue the way of life we all enjoy.One other thing, on disc 6 there are interviews some of the Marines depicted in the episodes.  Wow, what a wonderful collection of interviews with these men, and in the case of the men who'd already died, their families.  This is well-worth the price of the set.

Ibarra,"[3, 5]","After reading the negative and positive reviews of the The Pacific and finally viewing the DVD set, I have to say that the series is just astounding.  First of all, comparisons to Band of Brothers (BoB) is inevitable but unnecessary given that the battles in the European and the Pacific theatres were fundamentally different as any professional and avid historian will tell you.  The documentary included in the DVD states this quite poignantly.As a result, the format and the presentation of the Pacific departs from BoB in that it focuses on 3 Marines (and not an entire combat unit as in BoB), and is much darker and cynical given that the Japanese and the Pacific War in general were far more brutal and savage to the American soldier. If you can understand these differences, the Pacific truly shines as it powerfully conveys how the 3 Marines change from gung-ho idealism to men emotionally and physically tempered by unrestrained combat, a relentless enemy, a brutal environment, and survivor's guilt.And who are these Marines ? John Basilone, a true-believer of the Marine Corp, who wins the Medal of Honor in Guadacanal, but perishes in Iwo Jima.  Throughout the story, you get the sense that he is on borrowed time, but nevertheless lives his life to the fullest knowing well and good that death awaits him.  Bob Leckie, a Marine who enters the Pacific war not completely understanding what he has gotten into, and as a result finds himself on the brink of insanity as he struggles to make sense of the violence around him. And Eugene Sledge, a Marine who at moments of vicious fighting in Okinawa, finds and loses his humanity, and is left to question why he enlisted, the necessity of the war itself, and why he survived when others did not. In this vein, the Pacific is vastly more psychological than physical which is truly where the conflict lies in each man. Not to say that the violent battles depicted in the series are cheap and gratuitous. Quite the contrary.  They are brutally realistic and assault the very core of these Marines, who are left to comprehend and survive a vicious world turned upside down.For the reasons cited above, the Pacific is worth owning as it serves to better understand the WWII experience.

It was meant to give the feeling of what it might have been like to have actually been there, something you will not get from any history lesson.  And it succeeds in accomplishing this better than any other production about the Pacific theatre in WWII has ever done.  It follows three Marines through their service in the Pacific to the experience of returning home and trying to adjust to life after the war.  And, truth to be told, it is in fact history, it is just not the kind of history most people are used to.  It goes far deeper than the date and place type of dry history many folks may be used to.

No one is infalable, and no work is perfect.It seems that a lot of people were offended by the racist elements in this series, and seem to even believe that those sentiments did not exist.  The racism was in fact there, and was strong on both sides.  Posters made by the war department actually depicted the Japanese as being monstrous creatures with fangs.  This is a fact.  Oddly, some of these folks seem to have racist leanings of their own and perhaps are offended because it touches a nerve that they do not have the courage to admit exists.

It's given me a much greater appreciation of what some of our soldiers went through in the Pacific, although I already had a good idea from my father who was wounded on Luzon on 7 June 1945 at Bayombong during the campaign up the Caguyan Valley. He was the BAR man for his squad in the 129th Infantry Regiment of the 37th Infantry Division and was injured by shrapnel from a Japanese anti-tank round.  Left to die, he was rescued by Philippinos who got him to an aid station upriver by boat.  He won a Combat Infantryman's Badge, A Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. He spent weeks in a stateside hospital and was released with a service-connected injury and an Honorable Discharge.This brings me to my solitary complaint: why was this only about the Marines?  The U. S. Army played a significant part in the Pacific campaign and did most of the fighting in the Philippines.  Most movies suggest that the war ended at Iwo Jima and Okinawa.  Quite a bit of fighting went on after that, most of it by the Army, and this included the entire liberation of the Philippines, freeing many prison camps, the Battle for Manila, Battle for Baguio and so on, including the capture of General Yamashita.

I was struck by how much more brutal the Pacific island war was, mostly due to the Japanese unwillingness to surrender, which forced the Marines to kill large numbers of them. I had read Eugene Sledge's fine book, &#34;With the Old Breed on Peleliu,&#34; but not Bob Leckie's &#34;Helmet for My Pillow,&#34; which I've now purchased (on Amazon of course). It is a commonplace today to refer to all those in the military as heroes. I believe this is a bad habit. It denigrates the behavior of the real heroes. Everyone in the service has taken brave steps, and has put themselves (potentially at least) in harm's way. Some of the service people lose their lives as a result. But anyone who kills other people loses something else -- part of their humanity -- part of their soul if you will -- and it is this sacrifice that I was most taken with. It's unimportant that many in the military don't know it's going to happen, and some even don't realize that it has happened. It's still there, and the Marines in the Pacific theater, I believe, would all have said that they did what they had to do, despite suffering consequences afterwards. They gave up part of their humanity -- to keep themselves alive, to protect their service mates -- and ultimately for the people at home. That's the sacrifice we should honor them for. Despite having read many books about WWII -- and other wars -- there was something about The Pacific that highlighted this for me. As I think about it, the fact that the boys were so young, that the acting was so good, and that this aspect of their struggle was shown without smacking the watcher with it -- you should watch this series too and see what you think.",5,Sacrifice,1402617600,"06 13, 2014",2014,1814,"['watched', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'Pacific', 'Memorial', 'Day', 'year', '2014', 'had', 'watched', 'BoB', 'not', 'series', 'was', 'struck', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'brutal', 'Pacific', 'island', 'war', 'was', 'mostly', 'due', 'Japanese', 'unwillingness', 'surrender', 'forced', 'Marines', 'kill', 'large', 'numbers', 'had', 'read', 'Eugene', 'Sledge', 'fine', 'book', '34', 'Old', 'Breed', 'Peleliu', '34', 'not', 'Bob', 'Leckie', '34', 'Helmet', 'My', 'Pillow', '34', ""'ve"", 'now', 'purchased', 'Amazon', 'course', 'commonplace', 'today', 'refer', 'military', 'heroes', 'believe', 'bad', 'habit', 'behavior', 'real', 'heroes', 'Everyone', 'service', 'taken', 'brave', 'steps', 'put', 'potentially', 'least', 'harm', 'way', 'service', 'people', 'lose', 'lives', 'result', 'anyone', 'who', 'other', 'people', 'something', 'else', 'part', 'humanity', 'part', 'soul', 'will', 'sacrifice', 'was', 'most', 'taken', 'unimportant', 'many', 'military', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'going', 'happen', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'happened', 'still', 'there', 'Marines', 'Pacific', 'theater', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'said', 'did', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'suffering', 'consequences', 'afterwards', 'gave', 'up', 'part', 'humanity', 'keep', 'alive', 'protect', 'service', 'mates', 'ultimately', 'people', 'home', 'sacrifice', 'should', 'honor', 'having', 'read', 'many', 'books', 'WWII', 'other', 'wars', 'was', 'something', 'Pacific', 'highlighted', 'think', 'fact', 'boys', 'were', 'so', 'young', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'aspect', 'struggle', 'was', 'shown', 'smacking', 'watcher', 'should', 'watch', 'series', 'too', 'see', 'what', 'think']",N/A

Basilone's story is a major disappointment for me. It was emotional (I almost cried, I have to admit) but too much time was used to show his love story with Lena that if I didn't do my research I wouldn't know what he did in battle and how heroic he was. Most people don't know much about what happened in the Pacific as compared to in Europe during WWII. This could have been a perfect chance to tell people more about it. But no. The war in the Pacific lasted for 3 years, there are a lot of materials to work on, a lot of information that need to be shown.

It's that look that a soldier will have after only a couple of days of continuous combat, that shellshocked gaze that stares into an infinity beyond the horrific reality that they have endured and must endure again, and again.The young Marines that are sent Guadalcanal, many on their first combat mission, are pumped up for action, giddy with the fantasy of the battle to come and with that peculiar sprit de corps that only the American Marine can conjure.  As the reality of battle settles in, their faces reflect some nameless contradiction.  Disturbing beyond measure is not only the sudden, irrational death of their comrades, but the fanatical pursuit of death by their enemy. It strikes the Marine as appallingly unnatural that Japanese soldiers would fling themselves into the face of relentless machine gun defenses whose end can only be certain death.The camera fixes on the faces of the battle weary Marine as he contemplates such otherworldly moments that seem to last forever, then on a sea of corpses that was the night's work.  The faces look familiar, not because we recognize the actors (in many cases, we aren't likely to) but because we know them from photographs of war correspondents.  Yes, I would say that HBO nails the thousand-yard stare down pretty well.The Pacific is an ideal series for home theatre viewing.  With front projection or sizeable flat screens and a serious high-definition surround sound system we are transported, safely, into a world that few of us now living ever knew, even if our fathers did.  There is much to learn - in many instances, to learn all over again.  There is comment in the Extra Features that - rather unwittingly, I should think - warns against the tyranny of a colonial power whose manifesto is the domination of lesser peoples.Taken at face value, the drama that is the lives of Bob Leckie, John Basilone and Gene Sledge as they played their part in that great war is powerful stuff.  As with Band of Brothers, cliche is rare (after all, war is a cliche of sorts, is it not), sentimentality is left at the door altogether.  Bombs really do burst in the air and we are their victims as are they.As for the high definition part of the package: The Pacific looks great and will likely become a benchmark for sound reproduction.",5,HBO's THE PACIFIC on Blu-ray: The ideal Home Theatre experience,1287273600,"10 17, 2010",2010,2368,"['war', 'movie', 'ability', 'portray', 'thousand-yard', 'stare', 'look', 'soldier', 'will', 'have', 'only', 'couple', 'days', 'continuous', 'combat', 'shellshocked', 'gaze', 'infinity', 'horrific', 'reality', 'have', 'endured', 'must', 'endure', 'again', 'again.The', 'young', 'Marines', 'are', 'sent', 'Guadalcanal', 'many', 'first', 'combat', 'mission', 'are', 'pumped', 'up', 'action', 'giddy', 'fantasy', 'battle', 'come', 'peculiar', 'sprit', 'corps', 'only', 'American', 'Marine', 'can', 'conjure', 'reality', 'battle', 'settles', 'reflect', 'nameless', 'contradiction', 'Disturbing', 'measure', 'not', 'only', 'sudden', 'irrational', 'death', 'comrades', 'fanatical', 'pursuit', 'death', 'enemy', 'Marine', 'appallingly', 'unnatural', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'would', 'fling', 'face', 'relentless', 'machine', 'gun', 'defenses', 'end', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'certain', 'death.The', 'camera', 'fixes', 'battle', 'weary', 'Marine', 'such', 'otherworldly', 'moments', 'seem', 'last', 'forever', 'then', 'sea', 'corpses', 'was', 'night', 'work', 'look', 'familiar', 'not', 'recognize', 'actors', 'many', 'cases', 'are', ""n't"", 'likely', 'know', 'photographs', 'war', 'correspondents', 'Yes', 'would', 'say', 'HBO', 'thousand-yard', 'stare', 'down', 'pretty', 'well.The', 'Pacific', 'ideal', 'series', 'home', 'theatre', 'viewing', 'front', 'projection', 'sizeable', 'flat', 'screens', 'serious', 'high-definition', 'surround', 'sound', 'system', 'are', 'transported', 'safely', 'world', 'few', 'now', 'living', 'ever', 'knew', 'even', 'fathers', 'did', 'much', 'learn', 'many', 'instances', 'learn', 'over', 'again', 'comment', 'Extra', 'Features', 'rather', 'unwittingly', 'should', 'think', 'warns', 'tyranny', 'colonial', 'power', 'manifesto', 'domination', 'lesser', 'peoples.Taken', 'face', 'value', 'drama', 'lives', 'Bob', 'Leckie', 'John', 'Basilone', 'Gene', 'Sledge', 'played', 'part', 'great', 'war', 'powerful', 'stuff', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'cliche', 'rare', 'war', 'cliche', 'sorts', 'not', 'sentimentality', 'left', 'door', 'altogether', 'Bombs', 'really', 'do', 'burst', 'air', 'are', 'victims', 'are', 'they.As', 'high', 'definition', 'part', 'package', 'Pacific', 'great', 'will', 'likely', 'become', 'benchmark', 'sound', 'reproduction']",N/A

Don't get me wrong, I love Band of Brothers.  Both my grandfather fought in Europe.  That being said I think the Pacific really was an improvement on BoB.First off, one issue with Bob is that there are so many characters and they come in and out.  It just how it is because it's a rather factually accurate account (I've read Dick Winters autobiography and they did about as good as anyone has).  The first time you watch it it can be annoying.  I've seen it a dozen times so not an issue for me.In the Pacific there are three main story lines with focus on three main people.  I've read two of the three's autobiographies which were the basis of the show and they also do a very good job.  The focus on the three characters allows you to get more connected with them.  This also allowed for better acting imho as I felt the stretched cast in BoB resulted in some average acting.  Everyone in this show gives an amazing  performance and Rami Malick as Snafu really hits a home run.  I actually feel that this was a little more accurate and realistically darker then BoB.People also say that this one is boring action wise compared to BoB.  I really don't understand that at all.  There were several episodes in BoB which had little action, which was actually accurate and didn't bug me.  In Pacific however they do a very good job of putting serious combat in most every episode.Bottom line, I give Band of Brothers 5 out of 5 and I give this 5.5 out of 5.

Unfortunately, that reality was often disappointing although there were bright spots.One thing that I think is pretty much undeniable is that unlike ""Band of Brothers"" the story in ""the Pacific"" lacked cohesion.  It jumped back and forth from character to character and it didn't have the same wallop that ""Band of Brothers"" did by showing one group of men who fought together in a series of battles.The Good Parts1.  The fighting on Pelelieu was incredibly well done.  I had no idea until seeing the series that it was bad as that.2.  The scenes on Okinawa had similar impact.The Bad Parts1.  The Australia leave episode...nothing particularly wrong with it but it was totally expendable and slowed down the narrative (and I understand that the Leckie romance that was the central part of it was fictional anyway, so why bother?)2.  Leckie and his problem with bed wetting:  The episode that focused on Leckie's embarrassing problem really was the nadir of the series to me. I know that things like this happen in war but they are just not ""cinematic"" and the last thing I want to spend time watching.3.  The fact that the entire series never showed any of the Marines taking prisoners.  I know that the Pacific theater was possibly more merciless than the European theater, but I think it would have been good to show the protagonists of the story actually seeing the enemy up close after they'd surrendered (and some Japanese did surrender and did not get shot while trying to do so).4.  Tom Hanks' asinine comments about the war being charged with racism and vengeance were a major turn off to me.  I have no doubt that racism (on both sides) was present but ""you live when you live"" and it's infuriating to see someone judging events that happened a long time ago with sensibilities that have become predominant only recently.Overall, I was very disappointed and I don't see myself buying this DVD set.  I can only hope that Hanks and company do a series about other forgotten wars like Korea or maybe World War I or the Italian campaign in WWII.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[8, 10]","THE PACIFIC from HBO is the true story of three Marines, Robert Leckie (James Badge Dale), Eugene Sledge (Joe Mazzello) and John Basilone (Jon Seda) and their journeys through the bloody Pacific theater of World War II, from Guadalcanal to Cape Gloucester to Peleliu to Iwo Jima to Okinawa and, finally, for two of them, the journey home.Executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and others who were responsible for BAND OF BROTHERS, THE PACIFIC is, without question, a companion piece to that earlier acclaimed HBO mini-series.Perhaps the major difference between the two ten-part series, aside from the fact that one takes place in the European theater of World War II and the other is set in the Pacific, is that BAND OF BROTHERS deals with a company of soldiers, whereas THE PACIFIC centers on only three Marines.  We, as viewers, are therefore more able to narrow our focus and understand the harrowing emotional struggles that these Marines experience.Like with BAND OF BROTHERS, the many battle sequences in this show are extremely realistic, violent and horrifying, as are the post-battle scenes.  They may have been the enemy, but seeing the bodies of hundreds of mutilated, dead Japanese on the beach the morning after a nights-long firefight is very appalling.We, of couse, mourn the dead in THE PACIFIC, but this film compels us to equally mourn the loss of humanity suffered by the survivors, such as Eugene Sledge, a sensitive young man from Alabama who, by war's end, has become a brutal killing machine.Interestingly, the two most emotionally involving one-hour episodes of the series are #3 (""Melbourne"") and #10 (""Home""), neither of which feature battle sequences.  In the first one, the Marines from Guadalcanal are sent to Australia for a rest and one of them, Robert Leckie, becomes involved in a romantic relationship that the lady ends because she fears he will be killed.  In the final episode, the men return home after the war and try to adjust to civilian life.  Both of these episodes are extremely touching.THE PACIFIC is a magnificent epic production, beautifully written and directed, and filled with haunting images and memorable performances by a cast of, for the most part, unknown players.  It is also a production that people who shy away from extremely violent films should avoid.A sixth disc in the handsomely boxed set contains the following extras:PROFILES OF THE PACIFIC contains several 10 minute featurettes about the real characters portrayed in the mini-series, including interviews with many of them and their family members.MAKING THE PACIFIC is a 20+ minute ""Behind the Scenes"" documentary that includes interviews with Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and several of the key actors.ANATOMY OF THE PACIFIC WAR is a 10-minute featurette that includes newsreel footage and interviews with scholars, who give a historical perspective to the Pacific war.

Sure this happens but you only had ten hours here to compress several biograaphy books into a whole. However the pacific was savage on a whole other level with the japanese desire to take as many people with them making the marines view them as monsters that were no longer human.  That is the fact of this situation which does get some play with mothers and babys strapped with bombs coming at the poor marines. Ok, this still shows how serving in some of the battles of the pacific that the survival rate was not so good. But beyond that you get a good feeling of the suffering and heartbreak that these men endured. They really suffered beyong the limits of human endurance and so did the really tough japanese soldiers. It is forgotten though that the japanese empire had become under tojo,  a genocidal war machine bent on mass slaughter and the marines were not there for the same purposes , if the japanese had surrendered and not behaved the way they did then the whole thing wouldn't have been tipped into the horror it was.  One thing that this movie slides over is the fact that japanese slaughtered tons of civilians , however these flick cover the fighting on remote islands so we don't get that perspective.  This is worth seeing on many levels and the acting is superb from the whole cast who were  really dedicated to this project. It's a major achievement in some ways but it's not perfect. The backstories are not boring either they are very real and to the point.

I obviously can't comment on how realistic it is, but I do know that it never showed Marines as anything more or less than human. They did what they had to do to overcome an entrenched, resourceful and determined enemy and they were permanently scarred by what they experienced. I fail, utterly, to see how that would offend anyone who calls themself a patriot. I sure get tired of people who see a political agenda simply because the American military men are not cut from the John Wayne mold. These men were fully human, and the immense pressure of war made have made some of their behavior hard to look at. But that's not a ""political agenda"" and only a true ideologue would see it that way.For fans of ""Band Of Brothers"" ( which I am ) it shows a completely different war fought under completely different circumstances. The European and Pacific wars had little in common except their goal of bringing an end to bloodshed started by a tyrants. It falls slightly short in it's off-the-battlefield character development, but only in some minor ways. Other than this it is a great and engrossing series that makes a fine companion piece to ""Band Of Brothers"", although ""The Pacific"" is definitely the more violent of two. This reflects the radically different strategic and tactical goals of the two wars, not an arbitrary decision to make the series bloodier.After watching this series and thoroughly enjoying it, I am even more grateful to the U.S. Marines who sacrificed their lives or were left physically and/or mentally disabled. If the effect of ""The Pacific"" was to create sentiment of the anti-military variety, it failed miserably in that regard with me. These young men were the best of America, and they fought battles they didn't ask for with courage and tenacity that 99% of us will never need to display. I am proud to be an American and the father of a U.S. Marine.

First off, let's get the BAND OF BROTHER comparisons out of the way.  It's very different.  Less focus on heroics, no focus on one company, less time to focus on sub characters and there's nobody who owned like Spears.  In fact, this series focuses much more on the environment working against the marines (i.e. malaria, mud pits and other diseases) and especially on their mental breakdown as they witness atrocity after atrocity.  One of the arguments is that those fighting in Europe has it easier but that's up for debate, I suspect.  The miniseries follows three marines in different locations so at times the series lacks cohesion.  There's an extreme focus on the raw brutality of war as well as the overall bleakness experienced by its soldiers.  When you see Sledge trying to just get off the boat during his first island hit, well, you'll understand.  Nice touches on how most Americans didn't get what those veterans went through, especially in the last episode.  Surprisingly, my biggest letdown was that Leckie didn't get the girl I hoped he would get but I won't say anymore so as to avoid spoilers.

1203459,A2MVOO2CPB2X48,B001IBIHQ4,Northwest Reader,"[3, 4]","I waited a long time to write this.  I wanted to watch it twice before I typed a word...and did.  Wanted to figure out where I was coming from before I started.  In the interests of fair disclosure, I should let you know that I have a special interest in the Pacific Theater of war.  My dad was a P-38 pilot in the 49th FG, Stepdad #1 was in the Navy, Stepdad #2 was in the army, and my uncle was in the marines....ALL in the Pacific.  I have also written a few articles on the Pacific, and have written for Lightning Strikes, the journal of the P-38 National Association.  I say this NOT to brag, but to admit I may be biased.I think this is the most complete, the most real of ALL the great movies on WWII.  Pearl Harbor ranks at the bottom, its chick plot more of a distraction, and Barnett (sp) and Affleck were horrible caricatures of any of the WWII vets I knew/know.  So scratch that one.  The Thin Red Line was good, but way too much of a grad school phenomenon, with tricks and FX standing in for solid direction.  That leaves the Big Three of the modern era: Saving Private Ryan, Windtalkers, and Band of Brothers (BOB).  I have a difficult time ranking these against each other, one on one: a movie has 2.5 hours, maybe 3 tops.  A mini-series has more time to show us more, to explore in more depth.  SPR I put at the top of the movie efforts, mainly because it was the FIRST in groundbreaking efforts to ""get it right,"" and Hanks is great as always.  It didn't have time to introduce any women, and that was just fine.  There wasn't time.  But it beats out WT.  That leaves BOB and The Pacific (P).I don't think one can really compare the two in terms of ""which one is better"" any more than one can say which WAR was ""better.""  I will say this to those who think BOB was better: I would bet some serious coin it's because the European War is easier to understand for us, it comes closer to what we envision as the ""noble war,"" we can get our mental and moral hands around it.  When the Lt. or Capt. tells the 101st to ""Take that bridge,"" ""Storm that position,"" ""Spike that gun,"" it's clear and easily definable...like the European war itself.  Ernie Pyle relates this story in his book ""Brave Men"" and it gets at the heart of what I'm meaning.  There was a U.S. hospital ship off the coast of Italy, taking casualties off and getting them healed and back out of the war.  Unlike the secrecy for the other ships and everything else in the Italian campaign, the ship broadcast its position every 15 minutes, painted HUGE crosses on its sides, and trained searchlights on those crosses at night....it WANTED the Germans to know where it was and what it was at all times.  It was stopped and questioned several times by surfaced German U-Boats, and German planes circled it, but did NOT fire.  The reason was simple: the German fighting machine--for all its admitted cruelties and tenacity--tried much of the time to at least pay solid lip service to the general articles of war and the just war tradition.  We could appeal to that.  We had NOTHING analogous to do that on the Japanese side.  Nothing.This series also has no clearcut narrative like SPR or BOB.  And that's another reason I think that some people have a more difficult time with this series/movie.  Not only tactically, but strategically.  You're right there with the Marines..slogging it out on Pelilieu or Okinawa or Iwo Jima.  You're not privy to any grand strategy because the directors want you think see what the Marines saw, feel what they felt.  They had little grasp of grand strategy, and their world was one god-forsaken hell-hole at a time.  Period.  But that makes it tough for movie goers too.The Pacific War degenerated into primitive barbarity and savagery.  And make no mistake: the right side won.  For anyone who questions if the atomic bombs were necessary, have them watch The Pacific.  Now to the meat of it all.Brilliant performances by the actors.  Leckie and Sledge are the real deal.  You watch them degenerate into (almost) the same types of beasts they were fighting.  But that's real.  Deal with it.  I remember this story from my uncle (the marine): he was guarding some Jap prisoners and as they were marching by, my uncle noticed that one still had his sword.  My uncle said ""I want that, give it over.""  The officer started to protest.  My uncle leveled his rifle at him and said ""If you don't give me that sword in two seconds, I'll blow your ******* head off.""  He got the sword.  And he would have done it too.And that brings me to this: this movie/series is great because it helps explain that generation who came back from the Pacific.  It was Vietnam on steroids before Vietnam.  This movie is the most violent movie I have ever seen, but all the scenes have a point, and it's driven home unmercifully: this is the cruelest war we have yet fought, and this was our enemy.  Of course there is some simplification: Leckie's parents and Sledge's mom are morons and the former especially are played like simpletons--they didn't ""get it"" about their sons.  I also wished we'd see a better and more complete picture of the air war (no P-38s?...there were some even in the early days after the Canal was won...read Leckie's other book), but this was a series about the ground war so I get it.The music is moving, the ""home scenes"" are spot on, they do not distract.  Jon plays ""Manilla John"" great.  The sex is like the war--little time or desire for foreplay--quick and brutal (although there are really touching moments between the Basilones).  The fighting scenes are the best I've ever seen and capture the illusiveness and evil nature of the Japanese's warped and twisted version of Bushido: this is a violent, gritty, primal, slug in the face...which is EXACTLY what the Pacific war was.  I loved BOB and SPR, but for getting the total picture of the war, neither of them is up to P.  This series is the new gold standard.  Be careful who you watch it with and who you give it to (there are some horrendously violent scenes), but this is the way it was...or it least it's as close as we've come so far.  It probably hits the audience the same way Twelve O'Clock High hit the airmen back from the war only 6 years in 1951.  This is brutal.  But this is greatness.",5,Best of the Best....,1294531200,"01 9, 2011",2011,6274,"['waited', 'long', 'time', 'write', 'wanted', 'watch', 'twice', 'typed', 'word', 'did', 'Wanted', 'figure', 'out',

We asked ""who is that?"" so many times up until then. There wasn't good character development from the start.There was way too much nudity, it was completely out of place for the movie and didn't add to the storyline it distracted from it and cheapened it. It's like they went into this one saying okay we are going to make the guys grittier and show the darker side.  That could have been achieved without the nudity and kept it classy and we would have enjoyed the love interest story lines more.Even by the end there were less than 5 characters that either of us knew the name of. This is coming from die hard Band of Brothers fans. We bought that set and have watched it at least 4 times. We've lended it out to people saying you have to watch this. When you watch Band of Brothers, you feel the characters and you grow attached.  By the end of that one we were crying when it went through who the real people were. We never formed an emotional attachment to any of the characters of The Pacific except knowing there were real people who went through that. Leckie was the closest exception and the actor who played him was outstanding in the role.There was some well-done action scenes, but they were very scattered between the heavy focus on the love interests in the movie.So it was a mixed bag with this one.

You can't do that and fully enjoy and understand this film. By the time I got to the end of the second disc I finally realized this and began to see The Pacific for itself alone. One other thing: the Pacific war was completely different than the European war in many respects. That takes some time to deal with, too.It is a very good film. Here's what I think is right about it: 1. The music is beautiful. 2. The cinematography is outstanding. 3. The battle scenes when compared to documentary footage is very realistic 4. The Basilone depiction is excellent 5. The homecoming sequences at the end of the film are extremely emotional.Here's what I thought were its weaknesses: 1. the dialog and character development were somewhat disjointed. 2. The sex scenes were stupid and pure Hollywood garbage. 3. I know the Japanese soldiers liked night attacks, but a few more daytime battles would have been appreciated. 4. The acting could have been better. 5. Lastly, and most importantly, it did not have the writing and cohesion that Stephen Ambrose brought to B of B. But, overall, it was a very good movie.If Band of Brothers were never made, most people probably would have given it 5 stars, including me.

Nice to see a different theater of war and what the Marines had to go through in World War 2.  The beach scenes were good cause you see them leave the ships and then land on the beaches.  Not as gory as Saving Private Ryan but still good scenes.  I would like for Hollywood to start doing these types of mini series on The Forgotten War aka The Korean War.

You will feel every emotion when you watch it. There is no holding back here. This is the brutality of war like has rarely been seen. It will bring you to tears and you will wonder how on Earth any of these men could have survived much less retained their sanity.The 3 main characters whose eyes the story is told through are all unique in their own way and give the viewer the ability to view the horror of war as if they were one of their buddies right along side. Robert Leckie is the brash young newspaper writer who shows us that the will to survive in the face of total insanity is indeed doable. John Basilone is the reluctant hero of Guadalcanal. He is a man's man, a marine through and through who shows us all what a true leader should be. And then there is the shy country boy, Eugene Sledge, who along with his comrades experienced more than anyone could take but found a way to cope and enjoy a very successful life after the war.All of these stories needed to be told. And I feel humbled and richer for finally seeing how it actually was for these men.The only reasons I gave it 4 stars were because I felt, especially with the first few episodes, that they were a bit too short. I would have liked to have had better introductions to the characters. But by the time I had finished watching all 10 episodes and viewing all the bonus features this was not as big a problem as I felt initially. I also was not particularly happy with the number of sexually oriented scenes because I felt they were thrown in merely to titilate and did not really help the story at all. We all know these men met women while on liberty. No need to exploit this to the degree as was shown. After seeing Bob Leckie's widow in the Special Features I actually felt sorry that she would have to view her husband making love to another woman and having it so graphically depicted.But those are just small quibbles. This is a great mini-series and anyone who loved Band of Brothers (My all time favorite!) should really enjoy this. I also believe that watching it multiple times will increase your appreciation for what they have done here. And the musical score is fantastic as well. I just love that opening theme!

With names as Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg attached I was expecting a lot more.  I can't recommend this mini series to anyone unless you has time to kill and there is nothing else to watch.While some of the battle scenes were good, several scenes just don't do a good job getting any point across.  The writers look to be trying to makes us feel that the Pacific theater was hell, mission accomplished.  Yes, the marines fought hard for nothing at times, with no purpose but to survive.  War is hell and loss of life is tragic and this series does get the point across, but with little entertainment or historical value.  Take 10 hours and read a good books about the Pacific war.  The sacrifice made by Marines for our freedom isn't given justice in this series.  I wanted to love this series, because the Pacific was really the United States War.  The US was attacked and had to defend itself.  The European theater was more about a madman that was given power by brainwashed citizens looking for simple solutions for their problems.  While just as important to America at the time, we had more help to fight the Germans than with the Japanese.  We fought most of the Pacific theater with little help from our allies.  Australia was already helping to fight the Nazis and could only offer limited troops.  China had no power and was no better than a militia.  Japan was hoping for a quick war with the US and anticipating that the US would back down to concentrate it resources to fight the Germans.  They didn't feel the US could fight 2 wars. Luckily, America was up for the challenge and the US prevailed.Back to the series.  If you are going to watch this series be warned that it is long and jumps around to much.  You never really get a feel about the Pacific war except that it was brutal and effected the lives of many Americans.  This series is too much a soap opera and gives little in depth study of the war.  I feel the producers and writers were tying hard to show us a individual marine perspective, but they failed.  An episode or two devoted to troops under MacArthur command would have been nice.  With 10 hours you would hope to get some understanding of the Pacific war as we did with Bands of Brothers about the European theater.  Instead you are left with love lost and missing hope episodes.  Questions on why battles are fought are never addressed and sometimes the answer is there is no answer.  This series has too many incomplete story lines.  Almost every episode left me incomplete and unsatisfied.

Bloody, gripping, and far more damning of the condition known as War. Here the consequences, tragedies and violence of War is plainly evident as the men of the 1st Division slog it out in The Pacific. Grinding their way through well known places like Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima and Okinawa; the Marines also encountered heavy resistance in lesser known places like to Peleliu, Pavuvu and Cape Gloucester.Unlike BoB, this series follows some specific men from the 1st Division, the focus shifts slightly away from the camaraderie of arms and more towards the tragedy of war. In ten episodes, Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks craft a vision of war as the Hell it truly is. No glamorous celebrations as they 'liberate' the local Europeans we're all so familiar with, here is the unappreciated defeat and destruction wrought by brutal de-humanizing combat, soaked in the muck of a bloody fox-hole.The historical accuracy and attention to detail stand out in this artistic reproduction of the war in the Pacific. While the focus shifts away from the group, there is still plenty of character in the core characters and the men they fight with. A difficult chore of balancing continuous combat action with gripping personal consequences is deftly handled by the considerable script work. Towards the end of the series the viewer begins to understand just what PTSD is. When the boys come home, the relief is palpable and un-nerving, like a long and slow sigh of relief, joy and agony.The music, pacing, and production from top to bottom were superb.

Firstly, ""The Pacific"" in my opinion is more gruesomely realistic even than ""Band of Brothers.""  The battle scenes are fantastic and with Blu-Ray the realism is quite literally startling.  The entire production has a subtly authentic feel that is hard to describe.The characterizations are a bit weaker than Band of Brothers, but not bad for all that.  The acting is all pretty good, and contributes to the authentic feel of the production.  One gets a strong feeling for how tough the conditions were for our Armed Forces, and particularly the Marines, during the Pacific War, facing an implacable and powerful Japanese foe, with both sides miserable and far from home.  One cannot watch this production without gaining an appreciation for the sacrifices that our soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen made for America in her hour of need.The Blu-Ray quality is great, and looks fantastic on a big-screen TV.

The hd is dazzling, the characters finely drawn, the action scenes riveting, and the total experience extremely moving.  It is a great example of the modern anti-war genre that probably started with PVT RYAN and THIN RED LINE, continuing on through the two excellent Clint Eastwood Iwo Jima films. This new breed of epic looks at war in a far more realistic fashion than the old Hollywood propaganda-filled comic book imitations that had John Wayne saving the day with some super-human act of valor, this mini series recreates moments of battlefield history with incredible detail.A lot of strong performances and consistent leadership from a collection of directors makes this fall strongly in the winner's column. Big Spielberg/Hanks production values are everywhere. A wonderful extra is the enhanced viewing option, which replaces a conventional commentary. It has newsreels, interpretation by historians, and a ton of picture-in-picture interviews with the actual people who inspired the characters in the film.

1203530,A2ZDY6WY3MDJVZ,B001IBIHQ4,"Sight Reader ""sight_reader""","[16, 21]","When I talked to a 1st and 4th Marine Division vet, the reason combat accounts are often vague became very clear to me: ""At Saipan, we did a FOUR day assault, which was... the most..."" - as he trailed off, I could see his mind discarding a succession of words, and his eyes welled with tears as each attempt took him further back to places he didn't want to go - ""... INTENSE... experience"".  His relief at finally finding that single word - finally free to pull away from the nightmares and resume his story - communicated volumes more to me than any mere adjective.Very few units (never mind individuals) survived the entire Pacific war intact, and those who did can rarely afford to tell us much about it.  Thus, in lieu of a single narrative, the producers of ""The Pacific"" instead pieced together three stories which, taken together, span the experience of the 1st Marine Division throughout World War Two.  Leckie and Basilone's accounts cover Guadalcanal, Gloucester and leave in Australia while Sledge's account describes Peleliu and Okinawa, with flashes from Basilone describing life stateside and the landing at Iwo Jima.Several negative early reviews suggest to me that understanding the brilliance of this miniseries requires patience.  Indeed, upon a first viewing, ""The Pacific"" may appear muddled and disjointed as it forcibly juxtaposes three very different story lines at contradictory moments of dramatic inertia.  There are two critical reasons for this.One problem for the first five episodes is a matter of source material.  It is important to remember that ""The Pacific"" covers FOUR YEARS of warfare while ""Band of Brothers"" covers only one.  For veterans, the memory of earlier battles (such as Okinawa) tends to get obliterated by the searing intensity of late battles (such as Okinawa).  It would be much like trying to recall memories from childhood: you have isolated but extremely vivid scenes etched in your mind, but there is little rhyme or reason connecting them.  However, your more recent memories, especially when they are so wrenching, can be recalled almost to the day.The second problem is that of recognizing characters, a issue shared by ""Band of Brothers"". Many scenes appear to read as, ""Some random guy in a helmet tells us this and that"".  These ""guys in a helmet"" are not only hard to identify in their combat gear, but also answer to a bewildering variety of names, nicknames, ranks and even rank slang.  However, as those who've come to admire the once nameless likes of Hoobler and Shifty from ""Band of Brothers"" can attest, none of these helmeted figures are as anonymous as they seem, and as viewers go back and review these once random snippets they will discover a wonderfully rich tapestry of personalities that teaches us how the barbarism of war affected these people and their relationships to each other.No one demonstrates this growth better than Joe Mazzello (""Timmmy"" from Jurassic Park), who's slight frame evolves Eugene Sledge from a kindly, quiet kid to a bitterly angry vet.  James B. Dale may lack the confrontational ""bad boy"" edge that Robert Leckie's character seems to call for, but his powerful innate decency radiates a layered and humane interpretation that's endlessly watchable.  The inner life of John Basilone is not as well known, leaving actor Jon Seda little choice but to play him as a somewhat generic hero for fear of disrespecting a Medal of Honor winner by ascribing motivations that may appear less than courageous.  However, Seda is an excellent ensemble actor, most notably developing wonderful romantic chemistry with Annie Parisse in the calm before the storm of Iwo Jima.  This actress is just one of the many outstanding co-stars who create memorable sub-plots as they effortlessly perform the period dialog that seems to elude just about every other WWII production.The music is also unusual and daring.  Hans Zimmer's New Age sensibilities construct a distinctly Japanese dissonance of bells that quietly envelopes the fury of battle with an unsettling form of Zen that never competes with or interrupts the urgency of combat - quite unlike the standard pounding action score or screeching horror effects that seek to heighten violence in other films.  Zimmer also proves he's perfectly capable of writing more conventional title music that evokes a gushingly American sense of honor without ever falling back on snare drum cliches.  His title music retains the ""Plaisir d'Amour"" quote (sung by nuns in an Ardennes convent) and will occasionally replay ""Band of Brothers"" in its entirety for those listening carefully to background music in certain dialogs.There are, of course, nitpicks, which are inevitable in a project of such massive scope: Leckie's romance central to Part 3 never ignites, American mortars seem to be more accurate that baseballs (even on the first shot), shell-shocked Japanese on the verge of starvation are somehow more energetic and cleanly dressed than Marines (or even Okinawan civilians) and the hasty exposition to Part 1 is quite awkward (yes, it's true that that the nation was gloomy, but it's difficult to imagine ANYONE - especially Chesty Puller - assuming the Japanese were on the verge of world conquest with their campaigns only 3 weeks underway!)  With that said, for every little thing ""The Pacific"" might get wrong, there is SO much more it gets right that there is little doubt that this series is now the definitive recreation of the Pacific conflict.The latter episodes of ""The Pacific"" are saturated with intense action and contain some of the most disturbing scenes ever put in a war film, once again reminding me of that conversation with the veteran: ""These are things that no human being can possibly deal with.  The only thing you can do is 'wall it out'.  Guys that couldn't wall it out - officers who were trained to cope by keeping things organized or artists who tried to cope by expressing themselves - these people simply couldn't handle it"".  Even this man's tremendous skills, inherited from a lifetime in the backwoods, were of no comfort.  As a member of an elite recon unit, the Japanese would deliberately let his unit pass then ambush the main body behind him.  The number of times that he literally walked *through* the gunsights of hundreds of enemies - each CHOOSING to spare his life - was only one of an endless list of profoundly disturbing things he had to ""wall out"" just to survive another day... not to mention another year.To quote the series:""You can't dwell on it.  You can't dwell on any of it"".NOTE: To obtain honest and often intense Japanese accounts of the war, I suggestSenso: The Japanese Remember the Pacific War: Letters to the Editor of Asahi Shimbun,

1203535,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B001IBIHQ4,Sky,"[14, 20]","I thought that The Pacific was very well done. I've seen some pretty harsh criticism of the show, mostly claiming that there was a political agenda to the series. But color me naive; I didn't see a political agenda. I saw a miniseries that mostly took us through the hell that war was in the Pacific.Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie were US Marines during the time period, and much of The Pacific is based on their  memoirs respectively titledWith the Old Breed: At Peleliu and OkinawaandHelmet for My Pillow: From Parris Island to the Pacific. The miniseries tells the stories of the two authors and a third Marine named John Basilone. Basilone's story is apparently derived from the memoirs of a Marine that fought by his side during the war.The battles in The Pacific are brutal and life on the battlefield and war ridden Pacific islands was, well, again...hell. The series gives you a realistic look at times of battle, and takes some liberties with various shenanigans that went on among the troops on and off the battlefield. It also touches on how one could be affected personally by the war experience and how it affects the families back home. Almost two full episodes are devoted to relationships: one by Leckie in an Australian fling and the other detailing how Basilone met and married Lena Mae Riggi, a Sergeant in the Marine Corps Women's Reserve.But a tad morbidly I say that the real action--and what The Pacific portrays the best--is the ruthless battles that occurred in the Pacific regions during WWII. It is just amazing how brave the men were who enlisted in the service back during WWII knowing that if they were going to the frontlines, chances are that they weren't coming back. Hats off to them and thank you (the men and women today who go off to foreign lands to fight for America are of course just as brave...thanks to you too).The Pacific for me was thoroughly entertaining. While perhaps not a classic, it had some scenes that will probably stay with me forever. I'm not sure that the price of the DVD or Blu Ray makes it worthy of collection, but do try to catch it on HBO on Demand or at minimum rent it....That is if you've got 10 hours to spare.",4,Absolute Hell,1274400000,"05 21, 2010",2010,2179,"['thought', 'Pacific', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'pretty', 'harsh', 'criticism', 'show', 'mostly', 'claiming', 'was', 'political', 'agenda', 'series', 'color', 'naive', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'political', 'agenda', 'saw', 'miniseries', 'mostly', 'took', 'hell', 'war', 'was', 'Pacific.Eugene', 'Sledge', 'Robert', 'Leckie', 'were', 'US', 'Marines', 'time', 'period', 'much', 'Pacific', 'based', 'memoirs', 'respectively', 'titledWith', 'Old', 'Breed', 'Peleliu', 'OkinawaandHelmet', 'My', 'Pillow', 'Parris', 'Island', 'Pacific', 'miniseries', 'stories', 'two', 'authors', 'third', 'Marine', 'named', 'John', 'Basilone', 'Basilone', 'story', 'apparently', 'derived', 'memoirs', 'Marine', 'fought', 'side', 'war.The', 'battles', 'Pacific', 'are', 'brutal', 'life', 'battlefield', 'war', 'ridden', 'Pacific', 'was', 'well', 'again', 'hell', 'series', 'realistic', 'look', 'times', 'battle', 'liberties', 'various', 'shenanigans', 'went', 'troops', 'battlefield', 'also', 'how', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'affected', 'personally', 'war', 'experience', 'how', 'families', 'back', 'home', 'two', 'full', 'episodes', 'are', 'devoted', 'relationships', 'one', 'Leckie', 'Australian', 'fling', 'other', 'detailing', 'how', 'Basilone', 'met', 'married', 'Lena', 'Mae', 'Riggi', 'Sergeant', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'Women', 'Reserve.But', 'tad', 'morbidly', 'say', 'real', 'action', 'what', 'Pacific', 'best', 'ruthless', 'occurred', 'Pacific', 'regions', 'WWII', 'just', 'amazing', 'how', 'brave', 'men', 'were', 'who', 'enlisted', 'service', 'back', 'WWII', 'knowing', 'were', 'going', 'frontlines', 'chances', 'are', 'were', ""n't"", 'coming', 'back', 'thank', 'men', 'women', 'today', 'who', 'go', 'off', 'foreign', 'lands', 'fight', 'America', 'are', 'course', 'just', 'brave', 'thanks', 'too', '.The', 'Pacific', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'perhaps', 'not', 'classic', 'had', 'scenes', 'will', 'probably', 'stay', 'forever', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'price', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'worthy', 'collection', 'do', 'try', 'catch', 'HBO', 'Demand', 'minimum', 'rent', '.That', ""'ve"", 'got', '10', 'hours', 'spare']",N/A

And in that comparison, I'm afraid The Pacific falls short. It is less cohesive. Viewers may find themselves less invested in the characters. And there's no way around it -- The Pacific is very, very bleak and dark. To say that it's antiwar, though, or that it portrays Marines in a negative light is too simple, not to mention too naive.It's no secret that, post-Vietnam, war films have been darker, bleaker, and more morally ambiguous. Despite that, Band of Brothers was still fairly conventional. Yes, it was rough, but the guys were still heroes watching out for each other and fighting for their country. The point of The Pacific seems to be that war is pure hell, especially on these barren, rainy, muddy Pacific islands littered with bodies and debris. If Band of Brothers was about brotherhood and honor, The Pacific is about survival. It seems to ask, ""how do you survive something like war on Guadalcanal or Iwo Jima, not just physically but mentally?"" And, it turns out, that was incredibly difficult to do. Yes, there is some explicit sex and violence. If you want a feel-good war hero movie, look elsewhere. If you want a realistic but sympathetic portrayal of men fighting in the most horrible conditions imaginable, watch The Pacific.It's not something you pop in the DVD player or Blu-ray player for a fun, easy watch. It's something that you let sink into your heart and mind. You let it teach you lessons about the depths and heights of human possibility.",4,"No Band of Brothers, but definitely worth a watch",1289433600,"11 11, 2010",2010,1599,"['very', 'tempting', 'compare', 'Pacific', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'HBO', 'WWII', 'miniseries', 'preceded', 'several', 'years', 'comparison', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'Pacific', 'short', 'less', 'cohesive', 'Viewers', 'may', 'find', 'less', 'invested', 'characters', 'way', 'Pacific', 'very', 'very', 'bleak', 'dark', 'say', 'antiwar', 'though', 'Marines', 'negative', 'light', 'too', 'simple', 'not', 'mention', 'too', 'naive.It', 'secret', 'post-Vietnam', 'war', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'darker', 'bleaker', 'more', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'was', 'still', 'fairly', 'conventional', 'Yes', 'was', 'rough', 'guys', 'were', 'still', 'heroes', 'watching', 'out', 'other', 'fighting', 'country', 'point', 'Pacific', 'be', 'war', 'pure', 'hell', 'especially', 'barren', 'rainy', 'muddy', 'Pacific', 'littered', 'bodies', 'debris', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'was', 'about', 'brotherhood', 'honor', 'Pacific', 'survival', 'ask', 'how', 'do', 'survive', 'something', 'war', 'Guadalcanal', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'not', 'just', 'physically', 'mentally', 'out', 'was', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'do', 'Yes', 'explicit', 'sex', 'violence', 'want', 'feel-good', 'war', 'hero', 'movie', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'want', 'realistic', 'sympathetic', 'portrayal', 'men', 'fighting', 'most', 'horrible', 'conditions', 'imaginable', 'watch', 'Pacific.It', 'not', 'something', 'pop', 'DVD', 'player', 'Blu-ray', 'player', 'fun', 'easy', 'watch', 'something', 'let', 'sink', 'heart', 'mind', 'let', 'teach', 'lessons', 'depths', 'heights', 'human', 'possibility']",N/A
1203539,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,B001IBIHQ4,Steven Hancock,"[2, 3]","For the past fifty years, the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II has never been given the ""definitive"" treatment. Now, there have been some very good movies made about the events of the Pacific War (""Letters from Iwo Jima"" and the underrated ""The Great Raid"" are two very fine films), but none (save for maybe ""The Great Raid"") have really captured the full brutality, realism and heroism that shaped the war in the Pacific. But all that finally changes with ""The Pacific,"" the ten-part miniseries from executive producers Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and Gary Goetzman, the men who brought us the award-winning ""Band of Brothers,"" the definitive look at combat in Europe.Whereas the European and Pacific wars were vastly different entities unto themselves, the producers chose to take a different approach to ""The Pacific"" than was taken with ""Band of Brothers."" While the previous miniseries focused on the camaraderie that forms between men during war, this one focuses on the brutality of war, and how it affects the individual. It focuses on three Marines: Eugene Sledge, Robert Leckie and ""Manila John"" Basilone, and their actions in battles at places named Guadalcanal, New Britain, Peleliu, Iwo Jima and Okinawa, and how the war changed their lives forever.Does the new miniseries achieve the same power and gravitas that its sister miniseries did? It does come very close. The only thing that keeps it from becoming a perfect companion to ""Band of Brothers"" is the first four episodes of the series. Although very good, there are a few minor problems with them. Unlike the previous miniseries, which gave us a chance to get to know the men before throwing them into battle, we are briefly introduced to the characters before quickly being thrown into the conflict. So there really isn't a lot of emotional connection with the characters at first. Also, episode three of the program, a look at the 1st Marine Division's time in Australia during R&R; after Guadalcanal, provides the series' real weak point. Although a pretty good episode, was there really need for an entire hour devoted to the break between battles?However, things take a turn for the excellent with episode five, the beginning of a three-episode arc about the Battle of Peleliu, a battle unfamiliar to those who have not read either Sledge's or Leckie's memoirs, or frequent the History Channel. It is hear that the show finally achieves the quality of ""Band of Brothers."" The battle scenes go from great to fantastic, bringing us into the hell of the battle, and the challenges those men faced.Episode Eight of the series, one of the more mixed-reviewed episodes, is actually a well-written and performed episode that looks at the relationship between Basilone and Lena Riggi, the woman whom he marries before shipping out to Iwo Jima. While some people complained at the fact they focused on the love story, what sets this one apart from films such as ""Pearl Harbor"" or ""From Here to Eternity"" is that the love story isn't a flight of fancy; it actually happened. And as Tom Hanks said in an interview, ""it's damned good drama,"" and really helps us to feel an emotional connection with Basilone as he leaves the love of his life to return to the war effort, and his fate at the Battle of Iwo Jima.The penultimate episode of the series, Episode Nine, looks at the battle of Okinawa, and proves to be the series' best. Of the twenty episodes made of ""Band of Brothers"" and ""The Pacific,"" this is by far the most harrowing, graphic, and emotionally-draining episode, throwing us into a hell we could scarcely imagine. The final episode of the series shows the men return home, and the challenges they faced while readjusting to civilian life after the horrors they faced on the islands of the Pacific, and provides a powerful sendoff to this incredible series.As a whole, ""The Pacific"" is the definitive look at combat in the Pacific Theater of World War II. It shows the absolute horror that these men faced fighting an enemy that they didn't understand, on islands never heard of before. Most important of all, you get a real sense of the brutality of that war, and the sacrifices these men made upon the altar of freedom. ""The Pacific"" is a near-perfect companion piece to ""Band of Brothers,"" and one that will change the way one sees how that war was fought, and its impact on the participants!Program/Blu-ray Grade: A",5,"""Little did we realize that hell was an ocean away...""

Shouldn't he be auditioning for the 'Nutcracker?' ""  I realize the filmmakers were trying to have a character with an arc with ""Sledge"" (going from green to hardened veteran) but you've got to have someone the audience finds likable, and the actor playing ""Sledge"" was annoying with a capital ""A.""And his psycho sidekick ""Shelton"" was also so completely unlikable and unbelievable as a U.S.  Marine (did they really allow people creepier than Hannibal Lecter in the armed forces?), again it made each of his scenes painful to watch.  There's enough on the screen to make you squirm, we didn't need a sullen faced nerd and a Southern psychopath added to the mix.And with ""Shelton,""  it appears they wanted to show that some Marines had stopped seeing the enemy as human, but it doesn't work when you have a character more suited for a scene from ""Deliverance"" (remember the guy with one tooth playing the banjo on the back of the truck?

The writing follows script with bland dialogues, disconnected and uninteresting side plots, and battle scenes that are at best generic and boring.If you've read any quality history books about the American-Japanese war, you will be easily disappointed with how flatly the two adversaries are represented in the series. To be more precise, it's only the American side which is depicted at all (the Japanese are shown as zombie figures getting shot at in the dark mostly) and even then we are seeing unprocessed characters which cannot involve the viewer emotionally.I can continue with the Pacific's deficits but I don't want to waste any more time with this disaster than I already have.If you can keep your expectations extremely low and can be satisfied with precious little go on and give this a try.Otherwise, save yourself time and stay away from this.",1,The difinition of waste of time..,1292284800,"12 14, 2010",2010,1365,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'disaster', 'supposedly', 'have', 'read', 'T.Hanks', 'comments', 'have', 'polarized', 'people', 'frankly', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less.I', 'attempted', 'watch', 'series', 'what', 'bias', 'positive', 'negative', 'inspiration', 'was', 'book', ""'m"", 'reading', 'American-Japanese', 'war', 'Nemesis', 'M.Hastings', '.This', 'series', 'utter', 'train-wreck', 'dimensions', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'acting', 'when', 'not', 'horrible', 'simply', 'sub', 'par', 'writing', 'script', 'bland', 'dialogues', 'disconnected', 'uninteresting', 'side', 'plots', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'best', 'generic', 'boring.If', ""'ve"", 'read', 'quality', 'history', 'books', 'American-Japanese', 'war', 'will', 'be', 'easily', 'disappointed', 'how', 'flatly', 'two', 'adversaries', 'are', 'represented', 'series', 'be', 'more', 'precise', 'only', 'American', 'side', 'depicted', 'Japanese', 'are', 'shown', 'zombie', 'figures', 'getting', 'shot', 'dark', 'mostly', 'even', 'then', 'are', 'seeing', 'unprocessed', 'characters', 'can', 'not', 'involve', 'viewer', 'emotionally.I', 'can', 'continue', 'Pacific', 'deficits', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'waste', 'more', 'time', 'disaster', 'already', 'have.If', 'can', 'keep', 'expectations', 'extremely', 'low', 'can', 'be', 'satisfied', 'precious', 'little', 'go', 'give', 'try.Otherwise', 'save', 'time', 'stay', 'away']",N/A
1203547,A1PHVLYS6T4YW5,B001IBIHQ4,T. Berner,"[131, 197]","It's hard to believe that this series was produced by the same people who made the splendid Band of Brothers. Where Band shows the Americans as heroes and liberators, Pacific portrays the U.S. Marines as victims and dupes.Both programs led early on with a signature bit of heroism: the destruction of an artillery battery by a patrol led by Dick Winters and a night battle with some sort of vague heroics by John Basilone. While skillfully portraying the fog of war, Band of Brothers makes Winters' heroism very clear. It is never clear just what happens in Pacific. There is a night battle, tracers go flying back and forth and the next morning Basilone is declared a hero. This isn't a fluke. There is a deliberate attempt to downgrade the heroics of the the Americans. Of the three central characters in The Pacific, one is wounded, one is killed and one spends time in the looney bin.War is hell, of course, but World War II was a necessary war. Why treat the  two theaters of war so differently?The answer, I think, has to do with the psthology of modern culture. Until the early eighties, except for the reasonable debate over the use of nuclear weapons, the war in the Pacific. like the war against the Nazis, managed to avoid the general disenchantment with war, no matter how necessary and virtuous.Then a few college professors who had spend far too long in the ivory tower and not enough time in the real world wrote books revealing their discovery that there was a racial element to the Pacific War and that the Americans treated the Japanese brutally (somehow the good professors missed the cause of that brutality, such minor items like the Rape of Nanking and the Bataan Death March).There matters stood until 1999, when President Clinton awarded 22 Medals of Honor to the Japanese American 442nd Regiment to redress what he called the racism of the US military against the Japanese. The award of these medals was absurd. The 442nd won two legitmate Medals of Honor during the war, a great record for a regiment which fought on a secondary front against third rate troops, was in action for less than a year and did not face any of the desperate actions that make generals hand out high honors. By contrrast, the entire Marine Corps, almost 100 times larger than an army regiment, which was in action virtually every day of the war, and fought crack troops in opposed landings and furious counterattacks, won only 84 Medals of Honor. At least some of the Medals which Clinton handed out didn't even pretend that they were awarded for anything above and beyond the call of duty.No matter. Clinton's point was to accuse the US military of racism against Japanese and he succeeded there.In the last decade, this effort to denigrate the Pacific War spread into popular culture with Clint Eastwood's Flags of Our Father and Letters from Iwo Jima. Flags turned the heroism of Iwo Jima on its head and focused on the efforts of financiers to take advantage of the heroism of the Marines to sell war bonds. It was heroism as a capitalist tool. By contrast, Letters showed the battle from the Japanese viewpoint: men dying to protect their wives and families, dying for duty and honor.The Pacific extends this trend, including not just war as a way to sell bonds but showing the rest of the American effort as made up of victims.The reason for this is that the Baby Boomers are quite proud of their anti-war efforts, beginning in Vietnam (at least so long as they were still subject to the draft) and so on up to the present day. But this has resulted in horrible genocide around the world. More people of color have died in acts of genocide - in China, in Vietnam, in Cambodia, in Iraq, in Rwanda, in Darfur and now in North Africa - than died in the Shoah. Since the Baby Boomers like to think of themselves as virtuous, they need to denigrate the efforts of their forefathers to fight dictators. Hence programs like The Pacific. If you keep telling yourself that only fools and victims try to stop tyranny, you might be able to convince yourself that, contrary to Edmund Burke, all that is necessary for the triumph of liberalism is for good men to do nothing. Bunk, of course, but comforting bunk.But a curious side effect has occurred. You keep reading a lot of writers whose fathers or grandfathers won't talk to them about World War II. These writers conclude that these old heroes are too traumatized to talk about it. This is rubbish of course. If you are over fifty, you may have vivid memories of your pal's dads telling you about hand to hand combat with a Japanese soldier, about being a Jewish GI in a Nazi POW camp, about getting wounded, driving one of Patton's tanks, about Dunkirk and D-Day. And you get two old guys together and they immediately ask each other what they did in the war.Best of all, those of us who have come back from Iraq or Afghanistan know how these wonderful old men want to swap war stories with you. Suddenly, they aren't 90 any more. They are young and vital and the barriers of race, age, religion or ethnicity all fall away.So if you find these old vets clamming up, it has nothing to do with them and everything to do with you. They have found that you don't measure up and you don't deserve their memories. It means that they have determined that you have no sense of concepts like duty, honor, patriotism, standing up for the weak and willingness to fight evil no matter how strong. And if you wonder why these old heroes have determined that you're inadequate, The Pacific is as good an explanation as any.",1,Towards the Demonization of the Pacific War,1299715200,"03 10,

1203553,A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,B001IBIHQ4,The Guardian,"[0, 0]","It's ironic that the word for the planet's largest ocean means ""peaceful"" when the Pacific theatre of WW2 has become synonymous with probably the bloodiest and most ferocious warfare in human history.Spielberg's 10-episode ""Pacific"" miniseries in homage to the servicemen who fought against the Japanese in that enormous theatre of war is inevitably compared to its sister-series, the seminal ""Band of Brothers"" - a serious contender for the best-ever TV drama of any genre. ""Pacific"" has proved to be more controversial than the almost universally praised BoB for a number of reasons. Here's my take on it.Inspired by Stephen Ambrose's book and with the majority of survivors staying in contact as a cohesive group of veterans who had shared the same experiences in the same unit at the same places and times, BoB was an exceptional opportunity to follow the continuous month-by-month narrative of Easy Company's time in the European theatre. These factors worked in its favor to allow for the realization of a novelistic story developed over 10 hours of TV, diverting only to focus on this or that individual week by week as Easy's campaign took them across Europe in 1944-45. We got to know these men, to care about them and understand them.In contrast, the source material of ""Pacific"" comes from the stories of three separate individuals: Medal-of-Honor winner and national hero John Basilone killed at Iwo Jima, and survivors Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie who both later (much later) wrote best-selling memoirs about their WW2 experiences in the 1st Marine Division. This more ambitious concept makes for a somewhat fractured narrative, especially after episode 3 set in Australia when the stories of Leckie and Basilone diverge. On first viewing the series, it's not easy for the viewer to stay with who everyone is, especially some of the secondary characters, or to care about them. This definitely improves if you view the series a second time but it must be said that the overall concept, direction and editing might have made a slightly better job of this.Another issue is the extreme contrast between episodes focusing on the uncompromisingly violent and horror-filled combat-zones and those which take place in the USA (mainly focusing on Basilone's time there as a medal-winning national hero being used to sell war bonds, falling in love and getting married etc.), Melbourne (the whole of episode 3) and the Pacific R&R; base at Pavavu, including Leckie's time in the hospital. I think in truth this works quite well: this is how the Pacific War was conducted and the format illustrates how extreme was the experience these guys went through whilst fighting the island campaign and how it affected them psychologically. We're shown vividly that compared to the taken-for-granted comforts of peacetime life, being in these island battles was like being on another planet, or entering the Gates of Hell, and it was impossible for anyone not there to even begin to understand what it was like. The contrast is extreme, and illustrated well.A point of objection from some is the amount of profanity in the script. The language is realistic and how these guys in that situation talked: however, it might create some parental-child-viewing decision issues. The combat violence is as extreme as we've ever seen on film: heads blown off, limbs blown off, guts ripped out, Japanese soldiers burned alive. The marines, and the audience, get used to this level of carnage very quickly. As Spielberg says of this series:""It's brutal, and it's honest, and it's right there in your face - as it was for them.""Heated debate has been generated here on amazon and elsewhere over the graphic depiction of ""atrocities"" committed by marines in combat situations. Some viewers find this actually offensive, and it puts them off the series. Well, gold teeth WERE removed from the mouths of dead (and not always dead) Japanese soldiers with bayonets and collected by marines: this is attested by Sledge in his memoir, and by other veterans. The reasons why marines eventually behaved this way was because they were forced to witness persistent Japanese Army atrocities on civilians and captured prisoners, and this was not (in my opinion) explored as fully as it might have been. Japanese soldiers would never surrender, or hardly ever. They fought to the death. The Bushido code created a ruthless, murderous, cruel and fanatical enemy who fought with a suicidal ferocity found in no other army in WW2, and to prevail against an enemy like this US servicemen simply were forced to adapt and do likewise. The process which led to this could have been explored with a bit more illustrative detail.The acting is excellent throughout, often understated and subtle. All the three main leads are superb, especially James Badge Dale playing Robert Leckie with irony, intelligence and wit. Again this is more appreciated on second viewing. Even Rami Malek playing ""SNAFU"" Shelton who initially comes over as a kind of hard-as-nails psycho type mellows as we get to know him; his character works better on second viewing to reveal him as a bit more complex and nuanced, with a good and caring side, who has learned to cope effectively with the horror of his situation and the continuous loss of friends in his own eccentric way by building a hard shell around himself.Is ""Pacific"" the equal of BoB? Wrong question. It's different. BoB has a kind of shining nobility personified by the integrity of Dick Winters, played to perfection by British actor Damian Lewis, which ran like a seam of gold through the series. At the conclusion set in late 1945 in Austria, with Lewis' voiceover relating how the survivors of Easy's campaign returned to civilian life, the audience feels genuine heart-affecting emotion. In contrast, by the conclusion of episode 9 (on Okinawa), ""Pacific"" leaves the audience with something of a downer, drained and dispirited with little to mitigate the relentless carnage, the filth, the dismembered and rotting bodies and marines gradually becoming psychologically more unhinged as their buddies are killed off one at a time. Were these sacrifices worthwhile? There's little indication that any of the surviving marines felt they were. The final episode 10, showing the guys returning home in 1946 and rebuilding their lives, is an excellent and valuable bookender to the story and goes some way to mitigate the gloom, but does not succeed completely in doing so. Don't miss it.Worth seeing? You bet. Watch it twice; it's better the second time round when you have absorbed the mood and start to know the characters better. The extras on the Blu-Ray edition, including the ""enhanced viewing"" option (consider watching the whole series a second or third time with this facility engaged) are truly excellent. The bios on disc 6 are well worth seeing and bring the real people to life. The musical score is sombre, epic yet understated: near perfection.I'd rate this series about four-and-a-half stars, which is pretty good. It has a lot going for it, but is unlikely to leave you filled with warmth and nobility as did BoB, feeling it was all worthwhile. However if you haven't seen ""Pacific"", I'd strongly recommend you do. If you tried to watch it already and abandoned viewing part-way through because of any or all of the reasons explored above, give it another try. This series is a notable achievement with its own special character, and it will likely endure the years well.",4,"Carnage, horror and realism: ""Pacific"" misses the mark of BoB's greatness, but is it good?

The Japanese were an adversary who went to great lengths to engage their opponents as close as possible. This is also true of the Marines.

I understand how difficult it is to try and document a war fought on so many fronts (islands) for the Pacific theater.

Of course premarital sex was a reality but popping into bed twenty minutes after meeting someone in 1943 would be more appropriate for 2013.

The look and feel of the piece is similar to BoB, except that this mini-series follows several different story lines of individuals, not a single company.  While this expands the scope of the story being told, it also has a tendency to allow the viewer to lose a little bit of intimacy with each individual.  With BoB, you got to live and breathe with the company, and understand who each of these men were, and completely invest in them as individuals.  With the Pacific, it is a little harder to completely buy in to each individual because the story moves between lines often.  But this is its only flaw.

BOB is a high water mark, a Holy Grail in WW2 films/TV shows.  ""The Pacific,"" on the other hand, is not.  Though not a total low point, it's close enough to earn a 1 star.  Major problems are many, including the bad writing.  It's weak.  Very little effort was made to interject actual 1940s era words, phrases and slang, and likewise there is a serious lack of ""military speak.""  I served in the armed forces and, trust me, guys in the services are talking military lingo constantly.  So the dialog came off as unauthentic much of the time.  Likewise, the writers failed to create captivating characters.  Much to my dismay, I found the three lead characters--Robert Leckie, John Basilone and Eugene Sledge--all extremely boring to watch for nearly 7 hours.  Leckie and Sledge come across as morose, sullen and depressed most of the time.  Maybe that's what war does to most men, but it was boring as hell to watch.  Too much of the story also takes place in boring locales--stateside, Australia, a psych ward--wasting time and deflating the excitement built up when the men are actually at war.  The acting also seemed sub-par and lifeless, which didn't help bring any spark to the already flatly written characters.  And Jon Seda seems miscast as the legendary real-life Marine hero John Basilone.  Seda bares little resemblance to the actual Basilone and I just didn't buy Seda as this legendarily tough Marine.  There was also too much sex and nudity, which seemed extremely out of place in this series.  And FAR too many displays of stomach-turning blood, guts and gore.  At times it felt like I was watching a grotesque horror movie.  There was absolutely no need to continually wallow in scene after scenes of rotting and decaying Japanese corpses.  The action/war scenes are okay, but far too little to late to elevate this series marred by extremely poor writing, bad acting and questionable producing choices that fails to even come remotely close to the high standard set by Band of Brothers.

It is brutal as well as revealing. Non stop combat took its toll both physically and mentally on the men immersed in a world they couldn't escape. Death was only one mistake away, and the men depended on one another to avoid that lethal error. If you watch the daily heroism great granddad experienced, you'll come to know more about him than ever before, since he would never tell you about this experience.

This explains why the United States became a nation builder.Our true heroes were handed a Medal Of Honor on one day, and sent out to sell bonds the next day. John Basilone was one of these men, and his story is woven through out the series. America was broke and needed every dollar it could get for the war effort. Like he did on Guadacanal, Basilone stepped up and did what his nation asked of him.  In Marine Corps lore, he is an icon.

A few times, I laughed my ass off, especially the scene on Guadalcanal where the Marines pillage Army loot and then race away from the incoming MP's, then with the Marine officer telling the thief who stole the moccasins and the cigars, ""Don't let them catch you with those."" while the officer is currently holding a stolen crate of liquor! Then the scene where the gunnery sergeant on a firing range curses at a surprised officer who was waving his weapon around casually down the line and throws a few bullets in his face while doing so.There are many complaints about this movie, about how ""it's hard to follow the battles"" and ""inaccurate maps."" Well, I found it easy to follow the battles because I WATCHED the battle scenes, and as an Army veteran, found it to be some pretty good scenes of when Sgt. John Basilone and his men mow down hundreds of Jap troops in their suicide charge. I like when Pvt. Sledge enters the movie for good, since I read his book, ""With the Old Breed"" and some of the battle scenes match his own experiences. Sledge is shown as a rookie in the Corps getting to get the feel of the campaigns that he participates in, and by the end of the war, he has made the rank of Corporal, and the survivor of two bloody campaigns. Sledge has passed away ten years ago, but I think he would've liked to see this movie, despite what the critics say.

1203585,A2DLVJVYAVG37U,B001IBIHQ4,Up The Stairs,"[0, 1]","As I settled into watching The Pacific, I immediately began trying to compare it to Band of Brothers. Ultimately, this method became unfair to the story being told in The Pacific.  While the film was produced largely by the same team that made Band of Brothers, they are two different stories told differently.  Unfortunately, because of the series' promotion, comparisons between the two series are inevitable.  One can't realistically promote a film based on its connections with another film and not expect comparisons.This film contains three distinctly different stories about US Marines fighting in the Pacific against the Japanese.  These three stories never merge or diverge, they are told separately, focusing on the exploits of three primary characters; Eugene Sledge, John Basilone, and Robert Leckie.  The director chose to jump around and attempt to tell these stories chronologically and simultaneously. This method can be confusing, disjointing, and disruptive, and it was.  On the other hand, I thought they did a pretty good job of keeping it all together, except that Leckie is pretty much out of the story at the end of the 6th episode, though he comes back for about 15 minutes in the final episode.As far as watching a war film about US Marines and WWII in the Pacific, this is probably the best film, overall, I've ever seen.  It has enough variety and action to satisfy most any war movie enthusiast.  It has plenty of Spielberg quality combat action, complete with flying body parts, exploding bodies, horrific imagery, cruelty, and fear.  It is a war story of epic proportion told on a grand scale.I found the film lost tempo when it moved into scenes about the rear.  Covering the rear is all well and good, but I thought the producers spent far too much time in Australia chasing lasses and falling in love at Camp Pentleton than necessary.  Having said that, John Basilone's romance with Lena was probably an integral part to the story, whereas, Robert Leckie's love fling in Australia could have easily been ignored.  Leckie's brief romance just didn't factor into the over-all story, unless of course one wants to make a claim for some kind of esoteric message being extrapolated toward the final episode.One of the strengths of The Pacific is in the supporting cast.  The actors, both lead and supporting did a fine job, but some of the supporting actors were exceptional.  One that comes to mind is Rami Malek who portrays Merriell ""Snafu"" Shelton, a Marine from New Orleans.  Shelton comes into Sledge's unit shortly after Sledge's arrival.  He is a gruesome character who digs gold teeth out of dead Japanese soldiers and behaves immorally in situations that call for candor and dignity.  Nonetheless, he bonds with Sledge, and they help each other get through the war.  Malek's portrayal of Shelton is on the edge and quite good.  We might see more from him in the future.The Pacific is not a masterpiece, but it is epic and worth watching, and I'm glad I watched it.",4,Ends better than it begins,1294963200,"01 14, 2011",2011,3002,"['settled', 'watching', 'Pacific', 'immediately', 'began', 'trying', 'compare', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'Ultimately', 'method', 'became', 'unfair', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'Pacific', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'largely', 'same', 'team', 'made', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'stories', 'told', 'differently', 'Unfortunately', 'series', 'promotion', 'comparisons', 'two', 'series', 'are', 'inevitable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'realistically', 'promote', 'film', 'based', 'connections', 'film', 'not', 'expect', 'comparisons.This', 'film', 'contains', 'three', 'distinctly', 'different', 'stories', 'US', 'Marines', 'fighting', 'Pacific', 'Japanese', 'three', 'stories', 'never', 'merge', 'diverge', 'are', 'told', 'separately', 'focusing', 'exploits', 'three', 'primary', 'characters', 'Eugene', 'Sledge', 'John', 'Basilone', 'Robert', 'Leckie', 'director', 'chose', 'jump', 'around', 'attempt', 'tell', 'stories', 'chronologically', 'simultaneously', 'method', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'disjointing', 'disruptive', 'was', 'other', 'hand', 'thought', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'together', 'Leckie', 'pretty', 'much', 'story', 'end', '6th', 'episode', 'back', '15', 'minutes', 'final', 'episode.As', 'far', 'watching', 'war', 'film', 'US', 'Marines', 'WWII', 'Pacific', 'probably', 'best', 'film', 'overall', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'enough', 'variety', 'action', 'satisfy', 'most', 'war', 'movie', 'enthusiast', 'plenty', 'Spielberg', 'quality', 'combat', 'action', 'complete', 'flying', 'body', 'parts', 'exploding', 'bodies', 'horrific', 'imagery', 'cruelty', 'fear', 'war', 'story', 'epic', 'proportion', 'told', 'grand', 'scale.I', 'found', 'film', 'lost', 'tempo', 'when', 'moved', 'scenes', 'rear', 'Covering', 'rear', 'well', 'good', 'thought', 'producers', 'spent', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'Australia', 'chasing', 'lasses', 'falling', 'love', 'Camp', 'Pentleton', 'necessary', 'Having', 'said', 'John', 'Basilone', 'romance', 'Lena', 'was', 'probably', 'integral', 'part', 'story', 'whereas', 'Robert', 'Leckie', 'love', 'fling', 'Australia', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'ignored', 'Leckie', 'brief', 'romance', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'factor', 'over-all', 'story', 'course', 'one', 'make', 'claim', 'kind', 'esoteric', 'message', 'being', 'extrapolated', 'final', 'episode.One', 'strengths', 'Pacific', 'supporting', 'cast', 'actors', 'lead', 'supporting', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'supporting', 'actors', 'were', 'exceptional', 'One', 'mind', 'Rami', 'Malek', 'who', 'Merriell', 'Snafu', 'Shelton', 'Marine', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Shelton', 'Sledge', 'unit', 'shortly', 'Sledge', 'arrival', 'gruesome', 'character', 'who', 'gold', 'dead', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'behaves', 'immorally', 'situations', 'call', 'candor', 'dignity', 'Nonetheless', 'bonds', 'Sledge', 'help', 'other', 'get', 'war', 'Malek', 'portrayal', 'Shelton', 'edge', 'quite', 'good', 'might', 'see', 'more', 'future.The', 'Pacific', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'epic', 'worth', 'watching', ""'m"", 'glad', 'watched']",N/A

We see nobility and horrors in a mixed display that demonstrates what makes us unique but also how compassionate we can be as well as unmoored from our own morality some of us can become if the circumstances are forced upon us. Both are on display in ""The Pacific"" a companion piece to the exceptional ""Band of Brothers"". ""The Pacific"" gives us the perspective of the average Marine fighting in the Pacific theater during World War II. My father served in the Pacific on Tinian island towards the end of his service in the military but prior to that had fought in some truly difficult areas in the Pacific and while he was reluctant to share much from his days fighting the Japanese, his stories are well reflected in ""The Pacific"" a terrific mini-series that aired on HBO and was produced by Tom Hanks (like its predecessor ""Band of Brothers"") and Steven Spielberg.Many other reviews have suggested that this mini-series is anti-American because it focuses on atrocities committed by U.S. Marines during the World War II; I couldn't disagree more. The focus of this film ISN'T on the Japanese side and, yes, it's pretty well known that they committed horrible atrocities during WWII (and before)including but the Rape of Nanking, medical experiments conducted on other Asian peoples (such as giving plague contaminated food to villages and then dissecting their victims while still alive after; drenching people with water in freezing temperatures to discover whether or not the effects of frost bite could be reversed, etc.)and considered anyone who wasn't Japanese to be inferior instead it focuses on our side and what we did both good and bad during the war. ""The Pacific"" let's us peak through the crack and see some of what happened including what veterans faced during and after battle.I rented the DVD prior to buying the Blu-ray and while the DVD looks quite good some of the night scenes are a bit murky and indistinct so, if you have a Blu-ray player, I'd suggest going with the sharper, clearer and more vibrant looking Blu-ray set. It's more expensive but the action is more distinct and image clarity is remarkably good. Audio is outstanding throughout the series with a nice active presentation in the surround speakers.Producers Tom Hanks and Steve Spielberg insured that the show based on a pair of books by two former soldiers Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie who served in the Pacific was as accurate as possible consulting with experts on World War II. There has been some debate about the atrocities shown where some U.S. soldiers committed (taking the gold fillings out of a deceased Japanese soldiers mouth for example)and while no atrocity is excusable (and the Japanese military committed their fair share of them as well)but every war is filled with stories of nobility, courage and compassion just as it is filled with horror stories. ""The Pacific"" gives us a balanced view in an environment where killing and surviving are the two most important things without white washing history or making one side look more savage than the other. Keep in mind though that this is the story of OUR troops not the Japanese so the focus is as it should be on what we did both good and bad.The extras include the following: timeline for events, two Blu-ray-exclusive interactive companion features across all 10 parts: Enhanced Viewing, Field Guide Profiles of The Pacific: Delve into the lives of the real Marines featured in The Pacific.We also get ""Making The Pacific"" which take us behind the scenes and take an inside look at the making of the miniseries and ""Anatomy of the Pacific War"": allowing us to explore the historical influences and cultural perceptions that led to the merciless brutality in the Pacific theater of World War II.I would have liked to have production commentary tracks from the actors, writers, directors, producers as well as commentary tracks from military/history advisors to give us perspective but that is a small complaint for such an exceptional series.Keep in mind that ""The Pacific"" isn't ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" or any of the ""big"" Hollywood World War II films that were popular in the 50's and 60's--""The Pacific"" focuses on the common soldiers, their experience, the sense of brotherhood fighting under horrible conditions, the good, bad and the ugly of battle. This smaller, more intimate presentation allows the producers to focus on the characters not the events and that's all to the good.

1203601,ACG3UUASNO30I,B001IBIHQ4,William B. Fankboner,"[115, 171]","Are you Kidding? This is it? The long-awaited series on the Pacific War that was supposed to be a bookend to ""A Band of Brothers""? It looks as though Mr. Murphy was right after all: ""If anything can go wrong, it will."" For just about everything that could went wrong with this series.First of all ""The Pacific"" isn't a true historical series. More like a soap opera production with some interesting, and gratuitously gory, battle scenes thrown in. (You'd think every Marine was issued with a pair of pliers to extract the gold dental work of dead Japanese soldiers.) There's a definite anti-war spin to the series, and the suggestion that American soldiers were as brutal as those of the Japanese Imperial Army. There was, for example, a scene in which a Marine is using a dead Japanese soldier as a pin cushion with his bayonet, as if this was the moral equivalent to the Nanking atrocities.(The Nanking massacre was was not an isolated incident. One statistic tells us all we need to know about Japanese savagery and the ""Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"": approximately 30 million Chinese (and Asian) civilians died as a result of Japan's 15-year campaign of rapine, pillage and murder in Manchuria and on the Chinese mainland.)Unlike ""A Band of Brothers,"" the producers decided to make this series a statement about the personal lives of three soldiers, derived from their letters and diaries (like there's not enough third-rate melodrama already available on TV?). So, Guadalcanal is viewed from the perspective the ""Battle of Henderson Field"" and Chesty Puller rather than the ""Battle of Edson's Ridge,"" a patch of real estate defended by Colonel Edson and his Raider Battalion, considered by both American and Japanese strategists to have been the most decisive battle of the Guadalcanal campaign and possibly of the entire Pacific War.Battles in which Marine battalions defeated regimental strength Japanese forces were typical of the Guadalcanal campaign, revealed in the final casualty toll of 5 to 1. This lopsided tally was due to superior fire power and tactics: Japanese mass banzai attacks, frontal assaults and infiltration with rifle companies, which were effective against the Chinese army, amounted to pure suicide against seasoned Marines with automatic weapons. But the true enemies of the Japanese Imperial Army were the malarial jungles of the Solomons and the deadly accuracy of the Dauntless SBD dive bombers that sank nine Japanese troop ships.The inevitable comparison with BoB is not favorable to ""The Pacific."" BoB was a reasonably accurate dramatization of historical events. In contrast, ""The Pacific"" is dominated by a subtext: a surfeit of gore, an atmosphere of moral ambiguity and moral equivalence (e.g. repeated scenes of American brutality and the noble dedication of the Japanese soldier), a breathtaking indifference to historical fact and the strategic picture. There are, for example, the obligatory scenes displaying photos a dead Japanese soldier's family. (Yes, we know these obedient Japanese sons came from good families -- just like the Americans! -- the very families that raised them to murder hundreds of thousands of Chinese and Asian civilians in the name of their emperor, a war criminal with a hunger for conquest.) Indeed, the critics of this shoddy, lurid and sensationalized production, who say it is a insult to the military, are not far off the mark.In short, ""The Pacific"" is another unsavory exhibit of America's unquenchable appetite for 'slob culture,' and viewers taken in by the sexual sleaze, gore, pseudo-realism, and melodrama of this amateur production need to take stock. That said, the battle scenes are riveting (if not entirely factual). Battlefield v&eacute;rit&eacute;, in which you can actually hear the sound of shrapnel hitting a soldier's canteen, is Spielberg's strength; coherent narrative and convincing dialog are not. The problem here is historical authenticity and a fundamental lack of seriousness. Victory in the Pacific was an amazing story of U.S. persistence, bravery and the military genius of men like Colonel Merritt Edson, General Alexander Vandegrift and Admiral Ernest King. Dumbing down the action to the personal level does a disservice not only to the men who fought these battles, but to the intelligence of American viewers. Alas!

I just ordered BOB, but haven't received it yet.After watching this for the first time, I thought it was the best and most realistic view of WWII compared to anything I had seen before.  I felt like I was right there among the action seeing the war from a different perspective.  Most WWII films I had seen glamorized the war far too much and left out a great deal compared to this production.  The fighting scenes are excellent.  Those looking for the glamour of war should probably look elsewhere.  I was suprised that the packaging was in a metal container as I heard Band of Brothers is.  It's well worth the price.I had no problems with any of the discs and the bonus content was great since I didn't see this during it's run on HBO.  In my opinion, any mini-series Tom Hanks has been involved with is worth watching.  I also liked his John Adams series.  For me, these historical mini-series give me a view on life I've never seen.I hope they do one on the Vietnam War since I believe its veterans have not been given the honor they've deserved all these years.  At least many of them are still alive and could give us some great commentary.I'm looking forward to seeing Band of Brothers to see why some people love it more and hate The Pacific.  From what I understand from a Tom Hanks interview on The Pacific DVD set, Band of Brothers did not detail the characters lives after the war like The Pacific did.  The Tom Hanks interview said many Vietnam vets felt excluded and not represented in Band of Brothers which is why The Pacific was created to show the other side of the war.NOTE:  Edited to update after watching full DVD series.

The first 2 hours are good and try to balance the reality of battle with the purpose of it and even focus on the first winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor in the Pacific.  After the first two hours though, this film is not worth watching unless you enjoy seeing endless blood and body parts with no scenes of valor that redeem those who are fighting.  I would recommend watching the first two hours only and definitely skipping the rest of the 10 hours due to the constant depravity that is emphasized during the rest of the film.

That's pretty much what a lot of people are trying to do when I see all the comments about Band of Brothers.  Two seperate series and it's a mistake to look for BoB in the Pacific.  This series was about the horror of war and the marines that had to live through it, plain and simple.  It was violent and gruesome but it was honest.Not that I'm knocking BoB as that was a true story but the Pacfic lacks the comradery that BoB shared and for entertainment purposes that's a big thing to be missing in a war series.The special effects, costumes, performances...all first rate.  Anyone that is gun ho for war and combat because they play too many video games should watch this first before they rush off to fight in a real shooting war.

1203613,AP3B615GM191G,B001IBIHQ4,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 2]","The trouble with filmmaking (or film viewing, for that matter) is that benchmarks are set that affect the way we view the next product.  For example, ""The Longest Day"" was the standard for WW2 movies until ""Saving Private Ryan"" blew it out of the water.  Then, ""Band of Brothers"" set the bar even higher by explaining the entire war in dramatic fashion, not just a single battle.  Thus, ""The Pacific"" will forever be measured against BOB, whether fair or not, considering the different tone this series takes compared to the ""European version"".For a basic plot summary, ""The Pacific"" focuses on the stories of three U.S. Marines, always the ""first men in"" to all the major battles: Eugene Sledge, John Basilone, and Robert Leckie.  Their collective experiences allow us to see the events (both on and off the battlefield) in places like Guadalcanal, Pavuvu, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa.  Also, we get to have a glimpse of their lives away from the war and how they adapted (or failed to adapt) back into civilian life.In terms of tone, ""Band of Brothers"" was all about the battles, such as the spectre of D-Day or the bone-chilling conditions in the Belgium forest.  ""The Pacific"", though, takes a much more personal tone.  Sure, the key historical events and battles are covered in dramatic fashion, but this time the meat of the story is the characters themselves.  By the end of the series, it's almost as if these characters have become a part of us that we don't want to see come to a close.  As an added payoff, we also get some character resolution (something that BOB did not provide) for those main three figures.I thought that the first four parts of the show were average, it started picking up in 5-6, then exploded in 7-10.  That slow start prevents me from giving the series a full five stars, but other than that it was very solid.Overall, I still consider BOB to be the better series of the two, but that comparison is flawed because of the differing tones.  ""The Pacific"" does a great job in its own right of carving out a place in the war docu-drama category.  Just don't stop watching after the first 1-4 episodes...trust me, it really picks up.",4,A Different Tone Than BOB,1295136000,"01 16, 2011",2011,2167,"['trouble', 'filmmaking', 'film', 'viewing', 'matter', 'benchmarks', 'are', 'set', 'affect', 'way', 'view', 'next', 'product', 'example', 'Longest', 'Day', 'was', 'standard', 'WW2', 'movies', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'blew', 'water', 'Then', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'set', 'bar', 'even', 'higher', 'explaining', 'entire', 'war', 'dramatic', 'fashion', 'not', 'just', 'single', 'battle', 'Thus', 'Pacific', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'measured', 'BOB', 'fair', 'not', 'considering', 'different', 'tone', 'series', 'compared', 'European', 'version', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Pacific', 'stories', 'three', 'U.S.', 'Marines', 'always', 'first', 'men', 'major', 'battles', 'Eugene', 'Sledge', 'John', 'Basilone', 'Robert', 'Leckie', 'collective', 'experiences', 'allow', 'see', 'events', 'battlefield', 'places', 'Guadalcanal', 'Pavuvu', 'Peleliu', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'Okinawa', 'Also', 'get', 'have', 'glimpse', 'lives', 'away', 'war', 'how', 'adapted', 'failed', 'adapt', 'back', 'civilian', 'life.In', 'terms', 'tone', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'was', 'battles', 'such', 'spectre', 'D-Day', 'bone-chilling', 'conditions', 'Belgium', 'forest', 'Pacific', 'much', 'more', 'personal', 'tone', 'Sure', 'key', 'historical', 'events', 'battles', 'are', 'covered', 'dramatic', 'fashion', 'time', 'meat', 'story', 'characters', 'end', 'series', 'almost', 'characters', 'have', 'become', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'come', 'close', 'added', 'payoff', 'also', 'get', 'character', 'resolution', 'something', 'BOB', 'did', 'not', 'provide', 'main', 'three', 'figures.I', 'thought', 'first', 'four', 'parts', 'show', 'were', 'average', 'started', 'picking', 'up', '5-6', 'then', 'exploded', '7-10', 'slow', 'start', 'prevents', 'giving', 'series', 'full', 'five', 'stars', 'other', 'was', 'very', 'solid.Overall', 'still', 'consider', 'BOB', 'be', 'better', 'series', 'two', 'comparison', 'flawed', 'differing', 'tones', 'Pacific', 'great', 'job', 'own', 'right', 'carving', 'out', 'place', 'war', 'docu-drama', 'category', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'first', '1-4', 'episodes', 'trust', 'really', 'up']",N/A

I think people will watch it 30 years from now like we do the classics like Gone With the Wind. It's like War and Peace.  My father in law was with the 1st Marine Division on Guadalcanal and some of the other hellholes. He barely missed Pelilu.  He met his wife (my mother in law) when they went to Australia for R&R (I'm sure they were more reserved than some of the characters in the show).  About 10 years ago we went with them to Guadalcanal and toured the battle fields - Henderson Field, the Ridge, Alligator Creek, the Tenaru, and aross Iron Bottom Sound to Tulagi.  We had good insect repellant, but the 'no see ems' still bit us.  Imagine what a nightmare it was for the Marines and soldiers with mosquitos and all kinds of other vermin biting them, and the constant heat, rain and mud.  My father in law hardly talked about the bad, and never bragged. He told me funny stories, like 'borrowing' supplies from the Army, and having a Marine in his platoon who was a chef in civilian life. They enjoyed cakes and pies for a few days, after months of eating nothing but rice with weevils.  He passed away two years ago, but I think he would have liked this show.  We could have fast forwarded through the sex scenes.  The really violent scenes might have bothered him though, like, as others have mentioned, the horrific battle scenes on Pelilu and Iwo Jima, and the scenes on Okinowa where the men are close to losing their minds. These men literally saved Western Civilization and Tom Hanks and Steven Speilberg have done them and the nation a great service with this tribute.",5,Stunning Tribute to the WWII Marine vets,1294012800,"01 3, 2011",2011,1653,"['Pacific', 'as', 'powerful', 'feature', 'big', 'screen', 'movie', 'novel', 'think', 'people', 'will', 'watch', '30', 'years', 'now', 'do', 'classics', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'War', 'Peace', 'father', 'law', 'was', '1st', 'Marine', 'Division', 'Guadalcanal', 'other', 'hellholes', 'barely', 'missed', 'Pelilu', 'met', 'wife', 'mother', 'law', 'when', 'went', 'Australia', 'R', 'R', ""'m"", 'sure', 'were', 'more', 'reserved', 'characters', 'show', '10', 'years', 'went', 'Guadalcanal', 'toured', 'battle', 'fields', 'Henderson', 'Field', 'Ridge', 'Alligator', 'Creek', 'Tenaru', 'Iron', 'Bottom', 'Sound', 'Tulagi', 'had', 'good', 'insect', 'repellant', ""'no"", 'see', 'ems', 'still', 'bit', 'Imagine', 'what', 'nightmare', 'was', 'Marines', 'soldiers', 'mosquitos', 'kinds', 'other', 'vermin', 'biting', 'constant', 'heat', 'rain', 'mud', 'father', 'law', 'hardly', 'talked', 'bad', 'never', 'bragged', 'told', 'funny', 'stories', ""'borrowing"", 'supplies', 'Army', 'having', 'Marine', 'platoon', 'who', 'was', 'chef', 'civilian', 'life', 'enjoyed', 'cakes', 'pies', 'few', 'days', 'months', 'eating', 'nothing', 'rice', 'weevils', 'passed', 'away', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'fast', 'forwarded', 'sex', 'scenes', 'really', 'violent', 'scenes', 'might', 'have', 'bothered', 'like', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'horrific', 'battle', 'scenes', 'Pelilu', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'scenes', 'Okinowa', 'where', 'men', 'are', 'close', 'losing', 'minds', 'men', 'literally', 'saved', 'Western', 'Civilization', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Steven', 'Speilberg', 'have', 'done', 'nation', 'great', 'service', 'tribute']",N/A
