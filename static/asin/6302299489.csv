The cinema of 80's was filled with awful, corny films that seemed to embrace bad fashion, retarded dance-like mannerisms, chopped-up hairstyles, mindless music numbers, and loud colors. Teen Witch is no exception to this. It is also one of the worst pictures I've seen. Only if it would start off with a music video with Tawny Kitaen, it might have gotten a `2' from me instead of a `1'. Maybe...maybe not. Well, there is nothing good or much else to say about Teen Witch, so I'm just going to end it with a quote from wiki which pretty much sums up the film: ""The production budget for Teen Witch was $2,500,000. The film was released in the US on April 23, 1989 and grossed $3,875 in its opening weekend at the box office, and only $27,843 total in its entire run.""

""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[1, 2]","Robyn Lively stars as Louise Miller, a 16 year old high school misfit who discovers she is a witch;  in this half-baked cross between a John Hughes 1980's  Teen comedy and ""Bewitched"". Dick Sargent, who played mortal mate Darrin to Elizabeth Montgomery's enchanting Samantha in the second half of  the eight-year TV run of ""Bewitched"" (1969-1972), makes brief appearances here as Louise's mortal dad.The screenplay by Robin Menken and Vernon Zimmerman never makes the most of the supposedly ""magical"" premise. Louise's suddenly discovered magical powers don't even make sense. Why is Louise a witch? Nobody in her family has magical powers.  Louise's magical powers never seem natural or organic, because they are not. Louise uses a magic amulet, worn around her neck, to cast spells.  Louise has a quirky drama teacher (played by Marcia Wallace from ""The Bob Newhart Show"").  Louise uses her magical powers to send her favorite teacher away on a romantic vacation. Why? When Wallace suddenly disappears from the plot, so does a subplot about the school play. Supporting players Marcia Wallace, Dick Sargent and Shelley Bermann are all wasted. Zelda Rubenstein, the medium in ""Poltergeist"", gives the only effective ""adult"" performance  as Madame Serena (Serena is another nod to Elizabeth Montgomery and ""Bewitched""), the medium/witch who functions as Louise's magical mentor.At first, Louise uses her magical powers for the most elementary hocus-pocus; such as turning her annoying brother (Joshua Miller  into a dog, making an obnoxious date vanish, and causing a despised teacher (Shelley Bermann  to  make a fool of himself by stripping down to his underwear in class. Ha! Ha! Eventually, Louise casts a spell to make herself the most popular girl in school. She soon regrets it; especially since she can't reverse the spell.Louise admirably resists casting a love spell on sexy Brad (Dan Gauthier). But when Brad shows a genuine interest in her, Louise isn't sure whether the attraction is real or the result of magic. Either way, lucky Louise still has a hot make-out session with Brad (well, 1989 HOT) in what looks like an  isolated love shack.""Teen Witch"" features an obnoxious Soundtrack. Two musical numbers (""I Like Boys"" and ""Top That!"") are haphazardly inserted into the plot. Oh, there's also the prom finale. ""Teen Witch"" can't decide if it wants to be a bad 1980's teen comedy, a bad 1980's teen musical, or a charming/magical  teen fantasy. In trying to be all three in 94 minutes, ""Teen Witch"" ends up being a harmless, misguided mess for an undemanding audience with extremely low expectations.",2,"A MESSY MIX OF 1980'S TEEN COMEDIES & ""BEWITCHED.""",1317859200,"10 6, 2011",2011,2615,"['Robyn', 'Lively', 'Louise', 'Miller', '16', 'year', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'misfit', 'who', 'witch', 'half-baked', 'cross', 'John', 'Hughes', '1980', 'Teen', 'comedy', 'Bewitched', 'Dick', 'Sargent', 'who', 'played', 'mortal', 'mate', 'Darrin', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'enchanting', 'Samantha', 'second', 'half', 'eight-year', 'TV', 'run', 'Bewitched', '1969-1972', 'brief', 'appearances', 'here', 'Louise', 'mortal', 'dad.The', 'screenplay', 'Robin', 'Menken', 'Vernon', 'Zimmerman', 'never', 'most', 'supposedly', 'magical', 'premise', 'Louise', 'suddenly', 'discovered', 'magical', 'powers', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'sense', 'Why', 'Louise', 'witch', 'Nobody', 'family', 'magical', 'powers', 'Louise', 'magical', 'powers', 'never', 'seem', 'natural', 'organic', 'are', 'not', 'Louise', 'magic', 'amulet', 'worn', 'neck', 'cast', 'spells', 'Louise', 'quirky', 'drama', 'teacher', 'played', 'Marcia', 'Wallace', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Show', 'Louise', 'magical', 'powers', 'send', 'favorite', 'teacher', 'away', 'romantic', 'vacation', 'Why', 'When', 'Wallace', 'suddenly', 'plot', 'so', 'subplot', 'school', 'play', 'Supporting', 'players', 'Marcia', 'Wallace', 'Dick', 'Sargent', 'Shelley', 'Bermann', 'are', 'wasted', 'Zelda', 'Rubenstein', 'medium', 'Poltergeist', 'only', 'effective', 'adult', 'performance', 'Madame', 'Serena', 'Serena', 'nod', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'Bewitched', 'medium/witch', 'who', 'Louise', 'magical', 'mentor.At', 'first', 'Louise', 'magical', 'powers', 'most', 'elementary', 'hocus-pocus', 'such', 'turning', 'annoying', 'brother', 'Joshua', 'Miller', 'dog', 'making', 'obnoxious', 'date', 'vanish', 'causing', 'despised', 'teacher', 'Shelley', 'Bermann', 'make', 'fool', 'stripping', 'down', 'underwear', 'class', 'Ha', 'Ha', 'Eventually', 'Louise', 'spell', 'make', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', 'soon', 'especially', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reverse', 'spell.Louise', 'admirably', 'casting', 'love', 'spell', 'sexy', 'Brad', 'Dan', 'Gauthier', 'when', 'Brad', 'genuine', 'interest', 'Louise', ""n't"", 'sure', 'attraction', 'real', 'result', 'magic', 'way', 'lucky', 'Louise', 'still', 'hot', 'make-out', 'session', 'Brad', 'well', '1989', 'HOT', 'what', 'isolated', 'love', 'shack', 'Teen', 'Witch', 'obnoxious', 'Soundtrack', 'Two', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Boys', 'Top', 'are', 'haphazardly', 'inserted', 'plot', 'Oh', 'also', 'prom', 'finale', 'Teen', 'Witch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'be', 'bad', '1980', 'teen', 'comedy', 'bad', '1980', 'teen', 'musical', 'charming/magical', 'teen', 'fantasy', 'trying', 'be', 'three', '94', 'minutes', 'Teen', 'Witch', 'up', 'being', 'harmless', 'misguided', 'mess', 'undemanding', 'audience', 'extremely', 'low', 'expectations']",Teen Witch VHS

She has bad hair and an even worse wardrobe. Her younger brother is the very definition of annoying. And the guy she has a crush on doesn't even know that she's alive. All of this changes on Louise's 16th birthday. Suddenly she develops powers she didn't have before. All she has to do is wish for something and suddenly it's hers. And Louise knows what she wants. To be the most popular girl in school.We've all been there. Those early teenage years are awkward for most people,  so Louise's story was easy to relate to as well as being entertaining. When I was a kid I waited eagerly for this movie to come on HBO or the Disney channel. For about a decade between middle school, high school, and college, I hoped and prayed it would be released on DVD. Eventually I gave up and bought a $50 copy on eBay... that's how much I love this film. And now I've finally got the DVD and it was all worth it.Teen Witch has lost none of its charm in the nearly 20 years since its original release, and if anything it's gotten better with age. Louise's story is still touching and entertaining. There were still moments when I was mortified FOR her (what teacher would read a page from your diary aloud in class--Louise's teacher, that's who), and there were still moments when I wished I could BE her.

306459,A5GIYITYJPWN1,6302299489,"L P ""lilip""","[0, 1]","This movie is a typical 80s flick: the hair, the outfit, the story and especially the music. It is a light-hearted teenage romance about an ordinary girl who falls for the most popular and handsome guy at her school - who, of course - barely notices her existence. She is kinda dorky in her baggy clothes and bland hair-do and he is of course gorgeous with a hot girlfriend and entourage of equally popular buddies on his side. The opening sequence of the movie is just great in terms of how truly 80s it is. Teenagers today would think it was a joke and laugh at it, but back then, such cheesy openings, costumes, hair etc. were quite commonplace and I loved it.Anyway the ordinary, grey mouse discovers one day that she really is a witch who can make anyone and anything do what she likes. At first she does silly things like get back at her English teacher who torments her, turn her brother into a dog or make it rain etc., but then she gets serious and puts a spell on her crush who begins to take an interest in her. And that, unfortunately, is where it becomes silly to the point of annoying.Dont get me wrong: I loved this movie for what it was supposed to do: it is lighthearted, feel-good, happy. It's sort of like a 1980s Barbie commercial. But the story does not have much substance and the characters are flat. Dan Gauthier, who plays the crush, is very handsome and most scenes with him are shot like he was doing a Jeans or cologne commercial.  However, unlike many of the John Hughes' type of movies from that era (Some Kind of Wonderful, Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles) where the story, just like the characters, had dimension and layers, the characters and story in this movie are flat, two dimensional puppets. The premise is similar to ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" (girl falls for guy who doesnt appreciate her at first), but in ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" there were real feelings that developed, the characters were self aware, went through some kind of journey of self awareness, clarity and lessons learned, they had depth and dimension. Here, you see the boy fall for the girl because of a spell. That's it. There is a lot of internal consistency missing, like for example, after she removes the spell, what is it about HER that makes him come back to her. Where is the moment of clarity for him that makes him realize that, spell or not, she is the one? What about his gorgeous ex? Is she letting him go without a fight, or a cat fight with the new girl at least (Can't Buy me Love"", ""Secret Admirer"" anyone?). What's the lesson learned for both the girl and boy and ultimately the audience?The lack of these elements make this movie more a farce than an actual great movie with substance. It is totally possible to have the 80s cheesy, teen-romance element in there without making it look so silly or commercial-like. One of the reasons I like 80s teen flicks, aside from having grown up with them, is the way characters - because they are so young and closer to children rather than adults - are very much in touch with their feelings and know little about guile and deception and playing games. This movie had a lot of potential but missed the target pretty closely. It is not very believable - even in the realm of believability for 80s teenage flicks.That being said, it was still a lot of fun to watch. Not much thinking is required on your part and if you enjoy the 80s atmosphere, fashion, and music and just the lightheartedness that comes with that era, then this is one of the movies to go for. I found it to be very relaxing, especially in this day and time where everything is so complicated and where things have stopped being fun and silly and instead almost always have a serious, depressing, overtly sexual undertone. I am in my early 30s and I feel bad for the teenagers of today - with all their gadgets and facebook and twitter accounts that take them away from real human interaction and into a fantasy-world essentially with virtual friends, conversations and social lives. It must be sad. All those things were missing in the 80s and people (and the movies they were in) actually had to talk to each other, interact. No cyber stalking; if you like a boy, you have to actually go physically to the football field and watch him practice etc. There is something to be said about that and I am always glad to find it in 80s movies and especially teenage flicks. This movie, silly as it may be, is and does just that. I can imagine that as a 13 or even 17 year old, I would love it.",4,"Typically silly, hilarious, cheesy 80s movie",1287273600,"10 17, 2010",2010,4536,"['movie', 'typical', '80s', 'flick', 'hair', 'outfit', 'story', 'especially', 'music', 'light-hearted', 'teenage', 'romance', 'ordinary', 'girl', 'who', 'most', 'popular', 'handsome', 'guy', 'school', 'who', 'course', 'barely', 'existence', 'kinda', 'dorky', 'baggy', 'clothes', 'bland', 'hair-do', 'course', 'gorgeous', 'hot', 'girlfriend', 'entourage', 'equally', 'popular', 'buddies', 'side', 'opening', 'sequence', 'movie', 'just', 'great', 'terms', 'how', 'truly', '80s', 'Teenagers', 'today', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'joke', 'laugh', 'back', 'then', 'such', 'cheesy', 'openings', 'costumes', 'hair', 'etc', 'were', 'quite', 'commonplace', 'loved', 'it.Anyway', 'ordinary', 'grey', 'mouse', 'discovers', 'one', 'day', 'really', 'witch', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'anyone', 'anything', 'do', 'what', 'first', 'silly', 'things', 'get', 'back', 'English', 'teacher', 'who', 'turn', 'brother', 'dog', 'make', 'rain', 'etc.', 'then', 'serious', 'spell', 'crush', 'who', 'take', 'interest', 'unfortunately', 'where', 'silly', 'point', 'annoying.Dont', 'get', 'wrong', 'loved', 'movie', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'do', 'lighthearted', 'feel-good', 'happy', 'sort', '1980s', 'Barbie', 'commercial', 'story', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'substance', 'characters', 'are', 'flat', 'Dan', 'Gauthier', 'who', 'crush', 'very', 'handsome', 'most', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'was', 'doing', 'Jeans', 'cologne', 'commercial', 'However', 'many', 'John', 'Hughes', 'type', 'movies', 'era', 'Kind', 'Wonderful', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'Pretty', 'Pink', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'where', 'story', 'just', 'characters', 'had', 'dimension', 'layers', 'characters', 'story', 'movie', 'are', 'flat', 'two', 'dimensional', 'puppets', 'premise', 'similar', 'Kind', 'Wonderful', 'girl', 'guy', 'who', 'appreciate', 'first', 'Kind', 'Wonderful', 'were', 'real', 'feelings', 'developed', 'characters', 'were', 'aware', 'went', 'kind', 'journey', 'self', 'awareness', 'clarity', 'lessons', 'learned', 'had', 'depth', 'dimension', 'Here', 'see', 'boy', 'fall', 'girl', 'spell', 'lot', 'internal', 'consistency', 'missing', 'example', 'spell', 'what', 'HER', 'come', 'back', 'Where', 'moment', 'clarity', 'realize', 'spell', 'not', 'one', 'What', 'gorgeous', 'ex', 'letting', 'go', 'fight', 'cat', 'fight', 'new', 'girl', 'least', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'Love', 'Secret', 'Admirer', 'anyone', 'What', 'lesson', 'learned', 'girl', 'boy', 'ultimately', 'audience', 'lack', 'elements', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'farce', 'actual', 'great', 'movie', 'substance', 'totally', 'possible', 'have', '80s', 'cheesy', 'teen-romance', 'element', 'making', 'look', 'so', 'silly', 'commercial-like', 'One', 'reasons', 'like', '80s', 'teen', 'flicks', 'aside', 'having', 'grown', 'up', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'young', 'closer', 'children', 'rather', 'adults', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'touch', 'feelings', 'know', 'little', 'guile', 'deception', 'playing', 'games', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'missed', 'target', 'pretty', 'closely', 'not', 'very', 'believable', 'even', 'realm', 'believability', '80s', 'teenage', 'flicks.That', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'still', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'Not', 'much', 'thinking', 'required', 'part', 'enjoy', '80s', 'atmosphere', 'fashion', 'music', 'just', 'lightheartedness', 'era', 'then', 'one', 'movies', 'go', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'relaxing', 'especially', 'day', 'time', 'where', 'everything', 'so', 'complicated', 'where', 'things', 'have', 'stopped', 'being', 'fun', 'silly', 'instead', 'almost', 'always', 'have', 'serious', 'depressing', 'overtly', 'sexual', 'undertone', 'am', 'early', '30s', 'feel', 'bad', 'teenagers', 'today', 'gadgets', 'facebook', 'twitter', 'accounts', 'take', 'away', 'real', 'human', 'interaction', 'fantasy-world', 'essentially', 'virtual', 'friends', 'conversations', 'social', 'lives', 'must', 'be', 'sad', 'things', 'were', 'missing', '80s', 'people', 'movies', 'were', 'actually', 'had', 'talk', 'other', 'interact', 'cyber', 'stalking', 'like', 'boy', 'have', 'actually', 'go', 'physically', 'football', 'field', 'watch', 'practice', 'etc', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'am', 'always', 'glad', 'find', '80s', 'movies', 'especially', 'teenage', 'flicks', 'movie', 'silly', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'can', 'imagine', '13', 'even', '17', 'year', 'old', 'would', 'love']",Teen Witch VHS

I sat watching it with my jaw scraping the floor in awe over just how horrible this movie was. The storyline is overly simplistic and doesn't flow - people run off and do things for no apparent reason. There are musical numbers thrown in for no apparent reason (and they aren't good enough to make you not care that they are there).  A shy student wants to be more popular and date the cute quarterback.  She does a make over, shortens her skirt, teases her hair, slathers on some make up, tosses in a little spell and voila!  Everyone at school loves her.  I understand that the whole &quot;lesson&quot; to be learned from this is that the girl just needed to have more confidence in herself, which is a great plan, but in the end, she still dumped her best friend (they don't reconcile before the end of the movie) and changed herself to make people like her rather than remaining true to herself.  The absolute most jaw dropping horrible moment has gopt to be the whitest, cheesiest rap sequence I have ever seen.  It was painful to watch it was so bad (and I am not a fan of rap so it wasn't as though I was comparing the &quot;home boys&quot; to the real thing).

Quite honestly, even though we have age and maturity behind us, seeing this again was more corny than nostalgic.Robin Lively plays Louise, an awkward geek girl who is feeling out of place in high school (the most original plot line ever).  She comes across a woman who she does not recognize from the Poltergeist series (ha ha ha) who informs her that she has special, supernatural powers and can use them to her advantage.  So, Louise uses these special powers and potions in order to do the things that we wish we could do - get revenge.  She gets back at the teacher who humiliated her beyond belief in class, the obnoxious little brother, and eliminates the horrible boy she was conned into a date with.  Finally, she uses it for love.  She has a horrible, embarrassing crush on the coolest guy in school, Brad, and attempts to get him to fall for her.  But she backs off.  Then she decides that she wants to be the most popular girl in school.  And she becomes as such, and then she learns a lesson and everyone lives happily ever after.Honestly, the story was not all that great and rather predictable.  And looking at those clothes and those haircuts is beyond funny.  But then again, he who is proud of the haircut they had 20 years ago can cast the first stone.  It was cute, it was every wish come true for every girl.  But I can't get over that teacher, maybe because we live in such a cautious world today.
