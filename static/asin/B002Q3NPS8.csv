That's fast work!Also the pregnant woman, who looks ready to deliver any moment - and the obvious scene we all know is coming up - was a little tacky.Other than, a good movie that'll help couples evaluate where they are and where they want to be.",4,Not a bad way to spend an evening,1344902400,"08 14, 2012",2012,649,"['Christian', 'movie', 'deals', 'disillusion', 'disfunction', 'three', 'couples', 'are', 'facing', 'marriages', 'retreat.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'Christian', 'plainly', 'marriage', 'truly', 'work', 'God', 'must', 'be', 'center.I', 'thought', 'movie', 'moved', 'couples', 'angry', 'happy', 'rather', 'quickly', 'one', 'counseling', 'session', 'one', 'walk', 'hill', 'fast', 'work', 'Also', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'who', 'ready', 'deliver', 'moment', 'obvious', 'scene', 'know', 'coming', 'up', 'was', 'little', 'tacky.Other', 'good', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'help', 'couples', 'evaluate', 'where', 'are', 'where', 'want', 'be']",N/A

As a Christian knowing God's plan for marriage is easy but sometimes accomplishing that plan and living up to those vows can be difficult. In today's society so many want to just quit at the first sign of trouble. 99.9999% of the time is it is purely based on selfishness. This movie touches on that issue and it does have a Christian basis. While in my life that is vital to some it might not be so. This movie is kind of like a Hallmark Channel Christmas story, Predictable but with a satisfying ending. It has humor, it shows how selfish we can be as humans, but at the end it does show the importance of marriage and understanding for it to succeed we MUST sacrifice what we want and live unselfishly.

Mera ""Diego""","[0, 0]","The only thing that kept it from being a 5 star movie for me was the acting and the ending - the chain scene wasn't done to its potential.Overall though I learned a GREAT deal.  The one line about ""the mirror lies to you"" I was able to use about two days after I heard it with my daughter that called me about an issue she was having.  Not with her marriage but the line helped immensively with the image issue she was having.I loved it that there wasn't any need for vulgar and infantile potty humor.  It dealt with some really serious and all too real problems in marriage.

1283400,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B002Q3NPS8,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[9, 9]","Comedy abounds within a serious look at 3 couples who decide to attend a marriage retreat center. The guys planned on getting their wives fixed while they golfed and fished, and the gals hoped their men would get shaped up. Not only was there humor in their weekend ahead, but also enough conflict to cause each couple to face the true issues in their marriages. It's a Christian look at marriage repair, right down to the Holy Bibles supplied by the retreat center for each 'camper.' Yes, it's an outdoor, rustic setting, beautiful scenery, and a place in California to be coveted, if coveting over a Christian film location is allowed.Of course the retreat owners Dr Craig and Katrina Sullivan use some rather unorthodox methods to bring success to the couples who are quickly identified as on the verge of real troubles. This couple is fantastic, singly & as a team. Jeff Fahey is the Dr., a burned out, in-your-face, negative counselor; while Victoria Jackson plays the blonde, upbeat, whiny voiced, cheerleader type. They set the high bar for the acting in this film. Faith-based filming has certainly advanced in quality.The three couples have 2 real husband/wife pairs. Claire (Andra Logan White)is the film/real wife of Mark (David A.R. White-actor, prod) who wants no kids and is yet untold of her pregnancy. Donna (Anna Zielinski-actress, prod) is so pregnant she's about to burst and is film/real wife of James (Matthew Florida) a soap opera star. Another interesting character is a squirrely little single sad guy with a key to a computer banned to the couples. He makes a fast change from humor to sympathy, and played by Brad Stine (Christian comedian).You can expect problems are ironed out and all is well in the end--obviously not the norm for a huge percentage of married coupled in today's real world lifestyle, whether they be Christian or not. But it makes for a pleasant ending, and makes a point of the need for a third person being the peak of a triangle focus in a marriage. God.It's an entertaining way to look at a serious subject, preservation of the covenant of marriage. Leaves the viewer laughing and thinking. That's the obvious intent for this PURE/FLIX Entertainment company film.Bonus was a 30-minute look behind the scenes and cast interviews, plus trailers.Subtitles were available, but we did notice a few discrepancies between the audio vs the text. Not enough to hurt.My wife and I both enjoyed this feature-length film. But we already have a triangle marriage.

Scenes didn't link together well, and some made no sense as to why they were included. Then suddenly there's miracles galore (sarcasm), but they had to wrap up the film in 10 minutes. A women has a 60 second labor, not likely for a first-time mother. The new father vows to quit his high-paying soap opera gig in order to focus on his wife and kid. That's nice, but you jettisoned your income source just when family expenses are going to increase. That's irresponsible and immature. This is the director's idea of a good father?

What are they do? Enter into the picture a guest couple at church who advertises their marriage retreat. The wives, all friends, feel this retreat might just help their marriages, but aren't sure how they'll be able to convince their husbands to attend. Meanwhile, the husbands, also all friends, think the retreat is the ticket to a relaxing vacation of fun in the sun at a beautiful retreat in the mountains.  Now, if they can just convince their wives...Marriage Retreat is a humorous, and at times serious, look at problems that can plague today's marriages.  The marriage counselors are a giving pair whose main goal is to serve the Lord through their marriage ministry. The husband is a serious, to-the-point man, who interviews the participants, one-on-one, and leaves each person with a question to ponder.  His wife, on the other hand, is the vivacious, energetic, high-voiced, happy type who balances out her husband's more somber nature.This movie is highly recommended and definitely worth the watch and includes, not only some hilarious parts, but also includes some takeaway value for all marriages.
