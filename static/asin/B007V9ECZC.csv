(See my review of season three to see my criticisms of it)This season contained the second half of World Series and introduces some characters that you might not have seen before like Seychelles, The Netherlands and Belgium.  Incidentally Belgium and Sey(that's what I call her because I seriously can't pronounce her name) come towards the end of the series so you almost know for a fact at this point that the hand was tipped that there would be (and is going to be) a 5th season.  You generally DON'T introduce new characters into a series when its getting ready to wrap up so you already knew what was going to happen there.""Nekotalia"" is one of the hidden gems in the season because it shows some of the countries (Germany, Italy, Romano, Russia, Japan and Austria) as felines and it actually makes for a very entertaining watch especially the final one where you have Austria and Germany's cat getting ready to go to a cat meeting and Austria still has signature ""Mariazell"" but its just too funny to see when he's a kitten.  Even funnier is when he's trying to bat down his furn and he hits his right ear constantly...quite amusing actually!One minor issue I had with this series but it wasn't a total deal breaker was actually during one of the end credits and the sequence of certain episodes.During the end credits of one episode during the season they showed a clip with Norway and Iceland.  The clip was actually from what has been called on Youtube as ""Extra Episode 1"" when Iceland finds out that Norway is his brother.  The issue here is that the episode DIDN'T happen yet so it was kind of confusing as to why they would show a clip from that episode.  You don't hear the audio but you see a brief glimpse of the scene which tells you the episode is probably on the disc.The episode sequence issue comes with the final ""extra episode"" of Hetalia and it deals with Hungary and Prussia as kids.  In that episode is when we have the hilarious deal about if Hungary is a girl or not and when she tells Prussia her ""secret"" he kind of looks surprised and all that.  The thing about it is that during the ""crotch cloth caper"" which happens during the ""regular episodes"" the clip when Prussia shows his shock from Hungary in the extra episode is revealed.  The only reason you have to watch the episode is to find out what the heck happened.Other than those minor issues I strongly recommend this season.  Its gonna tide you over until ""Beautiful World"" and I honestly can't wait.  I hope when we get to see it its just as AWESOME as Prussia is :)5/5 and like FUNI's motto:you SHOULD be watching!",5,A marked improvement over last season,1351728000,"11 1, 2012",2012,2725,"['Alright', 'let', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'season', 'was', 'big', 'time', 'improvement', 'first', 'season', 'World', 'Series', 'See', 'review', 'season', 'three', 'see', 'criticisms', 'season', 'contained', 'second', 'half', 'World', 'Series', 'characters', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'Seychelles', 'Netherlands', 'Belgium', 'Incidentally', 'Belgium', 'Sey', 'what', 'call', 'seriously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pronounce', 'name', 'come', 'end', 'series', 'almost', 'know', 'fact', 'point', 'hand', 'was', 'tipped', 'would', 'be', 'going', 'be', '5th', 'season', 'generally', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'introduce', 'new', 'characters', 'series', 'when', 'getting', 'ready', 'wrap', 'up', 'so', 'already', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'there', 'Nekotalia', 'one', 'hidden', 'gems', 'season', 'countries', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Romano', 'Russia', 'Japan', 'Austria', 'felines', 'actually', 'very', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'especially', 'final', 'one', 'where', 'have', 'Austria', 'Germany', 'cat', 'getting', 'ready', 'go', 'cat', 'meeting', 'Austria', 'still', 'signature', 'Mariazell', 'just', 'too', 'funny', 'see', 'when', 'kitten', 'Even', 'funnier', 'when', 'trying', 'bat', 'down', 'furn', 'right', 'ear', 'constantly', 'quite', 'amusing', 'actually', 'One', 'minor', 'issue', 'had', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'total', 'deal', 'breaker', 'was', 'actually', 'one', 'end', 'credits', 'sequence', 'certain', 'episodes.During', 'end', 'credits', 'one', 'episode', 'season', 'showed', 'clip', 'Norway', 'Iceland', 'clip', 'was', 'actually', 'what', 'been', 'called', 'Youtube', 'Extra', 'Episode', '1', 'when', 'Iceland', 'out', 'Norway', 'brother', 'issue', 'here', 'episode', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'happen', 'yet', 'was', 'kind', 'confusing', 'why', 'would', 'show', 'clip', 'episode', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'audio', 'see', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'scene', 'episode', 'probably', 'disc.The', 'episode', 'sequence', 'issue', 'final', 'extra', 'episode', 'Hetalia', 'Hungary', 'Prussia', 'kids', 'episode', 'when', 'have', 'hilarious', 'deal', 'Hungary', 'girl', 'not', 'when', 'Prussia', 'secret', 'kind', 'looks', 'surprised', 'thing', 'crotch', 'caper', 'regular', 'episodes', 'clip', 'when', 'Prussia', 'shock', 'Hungary', 'extra', 'episode', 'revealed', 'only', 'reason', 'have', 'watch', 'episode', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'heck', 'happened.Other', 'minor', 'issues', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'season', 'gon', 'tide', 'Beautiful', 'World', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'hope', 'when', 'get', 'see', 'just', 'as', 'AWESOME', 'Prussia', '5/5', 'FUNI', 'motto', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'watching']",Hetalia: World Series 2 - Season Four

1538614,A182VTJIIEVM37,B007V9ECZC,GintaxAlvissforever,"[1, 1]","BEFORE THE ARTWORK CHANGES!...No seriously, season 5 is already out and they changed the art style so this is the last time we get this art style. What I find funny about this season is despite putting half of the Nordics on the cover (Finland, Sweden and Iceland) they don't really have that many episodes given that it feels like this season, England stole the show (then again, England is so popular that he generally has more episodes than the other characters including Italy followed by Japan and America).This season picks up right after season 3 and I mean right after where they thought it would be funny to start season 4 with the last episode of Spain and Chibi Romano arc (and because of the long wait, some people forgot about what exactly happened but the episode does refresh you on the last episode of season 3). From there, the major arcs include the modern era, WWII, the 10th-15th (again I'm having hard time remembering what timeline is when Prussia finds out that Hungary is officially a woman) century and before WWII (I think the America talking to Japan is before WWII because America wasn't that nice to Japan during WWII for obvious reasons). This season continues to introduce new nations such as Belgium, Netherlands, remind us who the Nordics are again with Denmark and Norway added and Seychelles (who shows up in the last episode WHITE...where did her blackness go? Oh well, it comes back in season 5 anyway so no big deal.)Oh yeah! This season makes fun of the end of the world in the year 1000 and 2000...memories for us who were in the time period of 2000 who partied like its 1999. XD And then we rinse and repeat with the 2012 joke (not here but Hima-papa probably would have made fun of America if that was the case).Since this is the last season, you might as well pick it up since you probably bought the other 3 seasons to begin with.
