903931,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B0009E322K,,"[4, 4]","Gilligan's Island never had a special farewell because CBS never initially decided to pull the plug on the sitcom after its third season. It was supposed to carry on for a fourth season,but CBS decided at the last minute to give it the axe(the ratings were high when the series finale aired in spring 1967). But we do see the cast rescued in a subsequent TV movie that premiered,I think,in 1978(entitled RESCUE FROM GILLIGAN'S ISLAND). Despite the three-season run,GI has been relentlessly syndicated since CBS last aired it. I dedicate this item to the memories of Bob Denver(Gilligan),Alan Hale(the Skipper),Jim Backus(Thurston Howell III)and Natalie Schaefer(Thruston's wife Lovey Howell).

903942,A1T9PJBFBFKSGD,B0009E322K,Auburn Niewiadomski,"[1, 1]","Gilligan's Island's third and final season...that sounds really weird doesn't it. After only three seasons this legendary sitcom was cancelled for re-runs of Gunsmoke. But even though only three seasons were aired, in all there are ninety eight episodes we can watch again and again and they will never be forgotten. This show never had a high point or a low point, what am I saying! The whole series was a high point for the show, and the physical never got dull. Thirty episodes were aired for season three and there really is no ending, and to be honest, I'm glad there isn't. Do they get off the island? We'll never know unless that is, if you watch the full length movie ""Rescue from Gilligan's Island.""Season three's box set is in just as high quality as the first two, nice photographs of the cast and helpful episode descriptions on the inside of the DVD case. I know you probably already know this by now, but unfortunately the discs are all double sided so there easily scratched. But that's really not too big a problem, and I still haven't had too many problems with these discs yet. Again like season two, there is an introduction by Sherwood Schwartz to get you ready for the third season and he also did a commentary for episode four ""The Producer."" I was excited about a documentary on disc three called ""Gilligan's Island; A Pop Culture Phenomenon"" but it was unfortunately a bit short but still an interesting bonus feature to say the least.One of my favorite episodes is from season three, it's ""Pass the Vegetables, Please"" when they all eat experimental vegetable seeds and they develop strange powers. I must have watched this one ten times, I just love that episode. I was also excited that Sterling Holloway (the original voice of Winnie the Pooh) guest starred, he's is featured in episode twenty-eight which is called ""The Pigeon."" Down below I'll list season three's episode descriptions so you can remember your favorites.Up at Bat - Airdate: 9/12/66 - Gilligan is bitten by a bat, and he believes he's turning into a vampire.

He has done Gilligan's Island cameos for many shows after Gilligan's Island's run, and it's just great that Bob Denver's unforgettable character Gilligan will always be remembered with this great DVD set. I hope he knew how much we appreciate his terrific job he did and that goes for the entire cast, this is a must have DVD collection for your family so they can show this to their kids and hopefully it will remembered for generations to come.",5,Gilligan's Island the Complete Third Season,1279152000,"07 15, 2010",2010,7889,"['Gilligan', 'Island', 'third', 'final', 'season', 'really', 'weird',

903944,A281387UUS2IN5,B0009E322K,Beantown Jim,"[3, 3]","Gilligan's Island was so well written, or so poorly written, that it has withstood the test of time.  It has been about 45 years since its debut and the comedy is not dated.  The concept of this type of humor, THAT is dated.  Physical humor is barely evident outside of Desperate Housewives.  We don't have the Marx Brothers, the Ritz Brothers, the 3 Stooges, Abbott and Costello.  Today we have PC humor, so measured and careful it could not possibly be funny.  In light of what passes for humor today, the simple writing of Gilligan is not bad.  THe lines for Mr. Howell were always the best;his snooty asides were very reminiscent of the snooty asides of Popeye(for those that paid attention), among others.A goofy show, but endearing, as with Lost in SPace. We all know these plot were implausible and thinly portrayed, but we also remember every episode by heart now.  The show was fun and if you want to restore that sense of fun, you might want this collection.  It is a pity that the actress Tina Louise, a beautiful woman when at her best and a fine actor, was at odds with the producers and the other cast members.  She was at times lacklustre and off her diet clearly in some shows.  When she was on as an actress it was great; when she was in her Hollywood shape, it was really riveting.

When we picked it up the other day we were surprised at the video and audio quality of most of the episodes.  The picture was clear and colorful and it appears they really worked on the sound of most of the episodes - very clear and full.  My son made the comment that it seemed like music sounding so good didn't fit a show this old!Why only four stars then?  First - not all of the episodes have had the sound / video work done.  Some still sound muffled, which is OK since that's how they sounded when I watched them years and years ago.  I just like consistency!Secondly - As with the old Columbia House VHS set that I have, some of the episodes have the opening title song in the wrong place.  Beginning with the spy episode and all of the episodes that followed, the title song came AFTER the opening scene, not before as in all of the previous episodes.

I, and many others will buy Season 3 on the day, or within the week of it's release. With great anticipation we will watch it, but we sadly know the show is no more after this.Gilligan's Island is a show with it's own great history, but is unique in it's own way. Fans know that the critics and prodcuers hated this show. One reviewer from way back then even said something like ""It's hard to belive that this show is made by adults"". As usual with all forms of entertainment, critics just don't get it. Gilligan's Island was a fascinating, entertaining, and highly enjoyable show. What other show has never been off the air and has enjoyed sindication for over thirty years? I think it's sad that the cast has never seen a penny.Who has ever channel surfed and come across Gilligan's Island? We all have, and most of us will put the remote down to enjoy it. Again, it's entertainment. We can escape our own world and enjoy a half hour in paradise. Sure we've all seen every episode a hundred times over, but who cares? We still watch it, and we'll watch it again and again and again.Maybe the movies will be released on DVD, but if you're like me and Tina Louise is your favorite castmember, it just isn't the same.So when we buy Season 3, remember you're not watching it alone, millions will be watching with you, we're family.",5,Adieu sweet island,1115596800,"05 9, 2005",2005,1430,"['Well', 'knew', 'was', 'coming', 'third', 'last', 'season', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'July', 'many', 'others', 'will', 'buy', 'Season', '3', 'day', 'week', 'release', 'great', 'anticipation', 'will', 'watch', 'sadly', 'know', 'show', 'more', 'this.Gilligan', 'Island', 'show', 'own', 'great', 'history', 'unique', 'own', 'way', 'Fans', 'know', 'critics', 'prodcuers', 'hated', 'show', 'One', 'reviewer', 'way', 'back', 'then', 'even', 'said', 'something', 'hard', 'belive', 'show', 'made', 'adults', 'usual', 'forms', 'entertainment', 'critics', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'was', 'fascinating', 'entertaining', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'show', 'What', 'other', 'show', 'never', 'been', 'off', 'air', 'enjoyed', 'sindication', 'thirty', 'years', 'think', 'sad', 'cast', 'never', 'seen', 'penny.Who', 'ever', 'channel', 'surfed', 'come', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'have', 'most', 'will', 'put', 'remote', 'enjoy', 'Again', 'entertainment', 'can', 'escape', 'own', 'world', 'enjoy', 'half', 'hour', 'paradise', 'Sure', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episode', 'hundred', 'times', 'who', 'still', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'again.Maybe', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'Tina', 'Louise', 'favorite', 'castmember', 'just', ""n't"", 'same.So', 'when', 'buy', 'Season', '3', 'remember', ""'re"", 'not', 'watching', 'alone', 'millions', 'will', 'be', 'watching', ""'re"", 'family']",Gilligan's Island: Season 3

903976,A2I4WF84MWIBO7,B0009E322K,Kai Lu,"[13, 14]","As others have already noted in their reviews, Sherwood Schwartz's sitcom ""Gilligan's Island"" was prematurely canceled after the 1967 television season, in order for CBS to make room on their prime-time schedule for one last season of the hit Western series ""Gunsmoke."" It would be wrong to praise Gilligan's Island by bashing Gunsmoke, since the latter is also a classic (and unlike Gilligan's Island, a long-running) television series, but it is certainly an interesting ""what might have been."" By the third year of their adventures on an ""uncharted"" island, it was clear that, far from running out of ideas and rehashing the same stale material over and over again, the castaways actually seemed to just be hitting their stride insofar as off-the-wall, so-idiotic-it's-hilarious comedy went. Gilligan's Island could have probably gone on to last at least six or seven seasons overall, but the very brevity of the show, and the lasting impact of the fewer-than-100 episodes upon millions of viewers worldwide, have served to make it a cult phenomenom -- something akin to the short-lived 90s series (and Clair Daines' star vehicle) ""My So-Called Life"" -- only without the pretense to realism or unnecessary histrionics.Gilligan's Island is a gloriously, unapologetically stupid show, and that's why it's so great, and in no season is its greatness more wonderfully showcased than in the final year of its prime time life. Of particular interest in the third season are the increased number of guest stars on the island, the increase in the number of dream sequences (the episode where the Professor dresses up like Sherlock Holmes and calls Maryanne -- dressed as an 1890s street-urchin flowergirl a-la Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady -- an ""ugly old lady"" is priceless), and the increased involvment of the whole cast in getting into zany situations. In the first season, each of the castaways played straight-man to Gilligan's wild eccentriciries, with the exception of Mr. Howell, who is for me the most amusing character in the show, but in the second and especially in the third all of the other characters get a chance to behave in a silly (and fun) manner.Each season of this show had many unforgettable episodes, but the third year -- and especially the episode where the castaways produced their own version of Shakespeare's Hamlet -- goes over the top, and in a good way. Other reviewers have already gone over the episode plot synopses, so I won't get into that, but trust me -- if you love Gilligan's Island, the episodes you'll find in season three are probably among the biggest reasons why.",5,The final season on Gilligan's Island also happens to be the BEST one!,1148601600,"05 26, 2006",2006,2606,"['others', 'have', 'already', 'noted', 'reviews', 'Sherwood', 'Schwartz', 'sitcom', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'was', 'prematurely', 'canceled', '1967', 'television', 'season', 'order', 'CBS', 'make', 'room', 'prime-time', 'schedule', 'one', 'last', 'season', 'hit', 'Western', 'series', 'Gunsmoke', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'praise', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'bashing', 'Gunsmoke', 'latter', 'also', 'classic', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'long-running', 'television', 'series', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'third', 'year', 'adventures', 'uncharted', 'island', 'was', 'clear', 'far', 'running', 'ideas', 'rehashing', 'same', 'stale', 'material', 'over', 'again', 'castaways', 'actually', 'seemed', 'just', 'be', 'hitting', 'stride', 'insofar', 'off-the-wall', ""so-idiotic-it's-hilarious"", 'comedy', 'went', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'could', 'have', 'probably', 'gone', 'last', 'least', 'six', 'seven', 'seasons', 'overall', 'very', 'brevity', 'show', 'lasting', 'impact', 'fewer-than-100', 'episodes', 'millions', 'viewers', 'worldwide', 'have', 'served', 'make', 'cult', 'phenomenom', 'something', 'akin', 'short-lived', '90s', 'series', 'Clair', 'Daines', 'star', 'vehicle', 'So-Called', 'Life', 'only', 'pretense', 'realism', 'unnecessary', 'histrionics.Gilligan', 'Island', 'gloriously', 'unapologetically', 'stupid', 'show', 'why', 'so', 'great', 'season', 'greatness', 'more', 'wonderfully', 'showcased', 'final', 'year', 'prime', 'time', 'life', 'particular', 'interest', 'third', 'season', 'are', 'increased', 'number', 'guest', 'stars', 'island', 'increase', 'number', 'dream', 'sequences', 'episode', 'where', 'Professor', 'up', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Maryanne', 'dressed', '1890s', 'street-urchin', 'flowergirl', 'a-la', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'My', 'Fair', 'Lady', 'ugly', 'old', 'lady', 'priceless', 'increased', 'involvment', 'whole', 'cast', 'getting', 'zany', 'situations', 'first', 'season', 'castaways', 'played', 'straight-man', 'Gilligan', 'wild', 'eccentriciries', 'exception', 'Mr.', 'Howell', 'who', 'most', 'amusing', 'character', 'show', 'second', 'especially', 'third', 'other', 'characters', 'get', 'chance', 'behave', 'silly', 'fun', 'manner.Each', 'season', 'show', 'had', 'many', 'unforgettable', 'episodes', 'third', 'year', 'especially', 'episode', 'where', 'castaways', 'produced', 'own', 'version', 'Shakespeare', 'Hamlet', 'top', 'good', 'way', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'gone', 'episode', 'plot', 'synopses', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'love', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'find', 'season', 'three', 'are', 'probably', 'biggest', 'reasons', 'why']",Gilligan's Island: Season 3

Ross ""Kristy""","[36, 38]","Unlike many other shows of the 60s, Gilligan's Island went out on a high note, leaving good memories of a show that didn't tail off in quality after a 3-year run. Surprising, considering that watching it, you realize how much of a one-joke slapstick it really was. Despite its observable limitations, it proved itself popular enough to warrant the show a significant spot in the pantheon of archetypal TV comedy and endless re-runs that never seem to get stale. Sherwood Schwartz (Funnyman who was the genius behind Hogan's Heroes) turns in a different comedy gem with Gilligan, showcasing how a simplistic premise can be stretched for 3 years and stay on top of the quality barrel. It's Saturday night circa early 60's and right after The Jackie Gleason Show on CBS comes `Gilligans Island'.When it first aired about the only two well-known members of the cast to the vast majority of viewers were Bob Denver who had appeared as the beatnik Maynard G. Krebs on Dobie Gillis and the multi talented Jim Backus. Russell Johnson who played the Professor was one of those actors that would appear on various TV shows. Its run on prime time was three seasons but thanks to re-runs Gilligans Island has in fact never left the airwaves. The 98 episodes play over and over yet they still hold up well today and one can still find themselves laughing at various episodes even though they may have seen it dozens perhaps even hundreds of times. The highlight, is of course, Bob Denver's fantastic comedic timing, coupled with some of the most original writing of the era. And let's not forget that fantastic theme song that has stayed burned in the memory of many fan's brains. A truly classic show that deserves its title, and the DVD extras are very welcome for a show that's almost 40 years old.

Although there are still some good episodes in it, there are too many dream sequences in this season for my liking.

For example Gilligan dreams he is a vampire, a super spy, Mr. Hyde, an admiral, a cave dweller. Mrs. Howell dreams she is Cinderella. There are a few good episodes but there are too many goofy plots. The strangest show of all three seasons is the one where a professional hunter comes to the island and makes a deal with the castaways where by he promises to rescue them if Gilligan can avoid being shot and killed.

It is simply plain and innocent fun.Creator Schwartz never set out to harm anyone nor to make a statement.It was just the funny antics of seven stranded individuals trying to cope and get along on a tiny island until rescue came.The eps in this season are really not much different in tone and execution than the others except instead of keeping most eps pinned to island endeavours,this season finds more and more eps taking place in dream like states allowing the cast to stretch a bit more.There are also seemingly more visitors to the island this season than last,but none alas ever effect a rescue.There is one ep however called ""The Hunt"" in this season that has to be given the ""most bizarre"" award for any comedy show,let alone Gilligan.It starred TV and screen actor Rory Calhoun as a hunter who arrives on the island.He doesn't hunt wild game but human beings and Gilligan becomes his main target.If there is any humour in it it is of the very,very dark variety.It belonged more on a Sci-Fi show than on a lighthearted show such as this.Truly strange.As with other seasons also Laurel and Hardy are certainly in the house as Bob Denver and Alan Hale Jr. do their best imitations of the legendary team.Hale especially successfully channels Oliver Hardy right down to the camera looks,the body language and finger movements.The professor is absolutely amazing with the inventions he comes up with this season(and they couldn't make it off the island?)and the rest of the cast are,well,themselves as usual.This season looks the best of them all as they are quite clear and crisp and there is an opening intro by creator Schwartz and a featurette on the series.The set contains three dreaded two-sided DVDs.I know companies do this for strictly financial reasons,but they are the worst way to go as they are terribly prone to scratching.Also the last disc here has only one operating side to it which begs the question:Why was it not made a single disc?Wherever your feelings may fall about this series place in television history good or bad,Warner Brothers has at least done the series proud and done a good job of transferring them to DVD.It took me a long time to get an entire set of the series(season by season)that wasn't plagued by scratches and scuff marks mind you,but it finally came together.I hope you have better luck than I did little buddy!",3,The castaways

The final season of ""Gilligan's Island"" contains the remaining 30 episodes of this classic television show in amazing color. Just like seasons one and two the video is outstanding. The colors are sharp and vibrant and the sound is clean and crisp and comes across nicely on my sound system. Once again all 30 episodes and bonus features are crammed onto 3 double sided discs but the quality is really consistent throughout the episodes. As for the bonus features, I didn't care for them. Sadly the loveable ""Gilligan"" played by Bob Denver passed away in September 2005 and he will be missed by fans of the show. However, thanks to these DVD season sets he will live on as the loveable goofball Gilligan forever. Why didn't the studio include any DVD interviews with Bob Denver or the remaining aging cast of this classic show? Any interview from Bob Denver about working with Alan Hale or the cast would have been nice bonus or a where are they now featurette would have been even better. I can't help but wonder if the cast knew the show was coming to an end, because the episodes got even better in the final season. The one major complaint I have is that the made for TV movies were not included as bonus discs or features for the season sets. The studio seemed reluctant throughout the DVD release to include bonus features of any kind. The season sets would truly be complete if all of the made for TV movies had been included.
