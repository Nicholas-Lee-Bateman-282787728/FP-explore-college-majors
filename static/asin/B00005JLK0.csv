Another example of this formula can be found in another slightly better film, &quot;Event Horizon&quot;, which is on a 'space-ship' rather than a regular one.An ocean-liner disappears many years ago, only to be discovered again inhabited by ghostly beings. There are some parts better than others, with some good old/new fashion jumps. That's what really counts nowaday's, I suppose. But, there were many times when I was left scratching my head, &quot;Where's Gabriel Byrne?&quot; The old &quot;Forget about the character's until the plot (did I just use the 'p' word as a descriptive?) needs them to turn up.&quot; On the other hand, there are quite a few surprises as far as the &quot;why's and where's&quot;, but once you know this would you want to watch it again? Describing the acting as GOOD, would be devulged as the same GOOD as Samuel L. Jackson, Dustin Hoffman, and Sharon Stone in (the letdown in my life-creation of my favorite book) Sphere.

I LIVE for scary movies, and, after a fellow Blockbuster denizen made the recommendation, I and two friends decided to rent this dvd just to get a good scare.Unfortunately, the thrills and chills in this movie were neither thrilling nor chilling.  I don't know how Juliana Margulies or Gabriel Byrne were convinced to do this flick, but it is just the most campy movie I've seen in a long time.  The special effects are pure cheese...severed limbs, fake blood, horrible demises for each of the characters...the filmmakers made the gore the central scare tactic, and it makes the whole thing rather boring.I think the best role is played by the little ghost girl who tries to guide Juliana Margulies away from the evil that eventually takes all of her crew.  She is sufficiently creepy and lends some genuity to the story....but that hardly makes up for the rest of the movie.If you are thinking of even seeing this movie, much less buying it, get ready for a dumbed-down, aquatic version of ""The Shining"" featuring a bad guy who steals souls.  The story is just not compelling at all, the characters are not well-developed (most are killed off before there's even a chance), and the visual effects are pretty blah.To sum it up: only see this if you're really really really bored and if you only feel like getting ""pseudo-scared.""",2,"Campy, campy, campy!",1050192000,"04 13, 2003",2003,1394,"['did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'expecting', 'that', 'much', 'Ghost', 'Ship', 'LIVE', 'scary', 'movies', 'fellow', 'Blockbuster', 'denizen', 'made', 'recommendation', 'two', 'friends', 'decided', 'rent', 'dvd', 'just', 'get', 'good', 'scare.Unfortunately', 'thrills', 'chills', 'movie', 'were', 'neither', 'thrilling', 'chilling', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'Juliana', 'Margulies', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'were', 'convinced', 'do', 'flick', 'just', 'most', 'campy', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pure', 'cheese', 'severed', 'limbs', 'fake', 'blood', 'horrible', 'demises', 'characters', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'gore', 'central', 'scare', 'tactic', 'whole', 'thing', 'rather', 'boring.I', 'think', 'best', 'role', 'played', 'little', 'ghost', 'girl', 'who', 'guide', 'Juliana', 'Margulies', 'away', 'evil', 'eventually', 'crew', 'sufficiently', 'creepy', 'genuity', 'story', '.but', 'hardly', 'up', 'rest', 'movie.If', 'are', 'thinking', 'even', 'seeing', 'movie', 'much', 'less', 'buying', 'get', 'ready', 'dumbed-down', 'aquatic', 'version', 'Shining', 'featuring', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'souls', 'story', 'just', 'not', 'compelling', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'well-developed', 'most', 'are', 'killed', 'off', 'even', 'chance', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'sum', 'up', 'only', 'see', ""'re"", 'really', 'really', 'really', 'bored', 'only', 'feel', 'getting', 'pseudo-scared']",N/A

However, stories about ships intrigues me (the mysterious ocean, perhaps?) so I bought this movie sight unseen.I had such a good time being scared and grossed-out! I really don't understand the reviewers who call this movie &quot;unoriginal.&quot; The gore sequences looked pretty good to me! But then I'm not a real horror movie affecionado, either.I do wonder why none of the previous reviewers have discovered the plot. Most say the movie's pointless and doesn't make sense. Have they never heard of the Ferry Man myth? In this legend, the dead have to pay the ferry man to cross the river Styx (one of the rivers of Hell), but should only pay AFTER the crossing (or he'll swindle you and you'll never get out of Hell). This is the reason why, in old European tradition, coins are laid upon the eyes of the dead.Get it? The guy who finds the ship and tells the salvagers about it is named Ferryman. Seems pretty obvious to me. I thought including that myth added a wonderful twist. There is also a song about the ferry man legend, &quot;Don't pay the ferry man,&quot; by Chris de Burgh.All in all, if you like scary, gory movies and don't care too much about acting but enjoy it when a movie delves into commonly known myths, then this movie is for you!",3,Love the thrill,1062720000,"09 5, 2003",2003,1354,"[""'m"", 'one', 'biggest', 'chickens', 'out', 'there', 'therefore', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'horror', 'movies', 'very', 'often', 'However', 'stories', 'ships', 'intrigues', 'mysterious', 'ocean', 'perhaps', 'bought', 'movie', 'sight', 'unseen.I', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'being', 'scared', 'grossed-out', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'reviewers', 'who', 'call', 'movie', 'quot', 'unoriginal.', 'quot', 'gore', 'sequences', 'looked', 'pretty', 'good', 'then', ""'m"", 'not', 'real', 'horror', 'movie', 'affecionado', 'either.I', 'do', 'wonder', 'why', 'none', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'discovered', 'plot', 'Most', 'say', 'movie', 'pointless', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Have', 'never', 'heard', 'Ferry', 'Man', 'myth', 'legend', 'dead', 'have', 'pay', 'ferry', 'man', 'cross', 'river', 'Styx', 'one', 'rivers', 'Hell', 'should', 'only', 'pay', 'AFTER', 'crossing', ""'ll"", 'swindle', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'Hell', 'reason', 'why', 'old', 'European', 'tradition', 'coins', 'are', 'laid', 'eyes', 'dead.Get', 'guy', 'who', 'ship', 'salvagers', 'named', 'Ferryman', 'Seems', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'thought', 'including', 'myth', 'added', 'wonderful', 'twist', 'also', 'song', 'ferry', 'man', 'legend', 'quot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'ferry', 'man', 'quot', 'Chris', 'de', 'Burgh.All', 'like', 'scary', 'gory', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'much', 'acting', 'enjoy', 'when', 'movie', 'commonly', 'known', 'myths', 'then', 'movie']",N/A

They also produced the remakes of HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL and THIRTEEN GHOSTS.  Both were equally terrible films in their own right, but GHOST SHIP takes the cake.  If those two films were bad, GHOST SHIP achieves a new level of awfulness.  All I kept thinking while watching this film was how notable actors like Gabriel Byrne, Juliana Marguilles, and Isaiah Washington would degrade themselves in such a stupid movie?  The paycheck must've been tempting.  This movie does everything a horror movie should NOT do - it's slow, dull, boring, not scary, not interesting, and (worst of all) extremely predictable.Only the first 5 minutes of the movie are any good, as it shows us what happened to the crew of the Italian cruise ship The Antonia Graza in 1962.  The opening credits toy with us, starting off like some happy episode of ""The Love Boat,"" before the real terror (or lack thereof) starts.  A cable line snaps off and slices every single member and vacationer on board.  There's a brief pause and slowly every person begins to break in half or lose a head or lose an arm.  The little girl is the only one to survive.  It's not scary, but this very gory sequence achieve a creepy disturbance that the rest of the movie doesn't have.The remaining 80 minutes or so of the movie are so deathly dull that I just wanted this thing to be over.  We know what's coming so sitting through this movie is pretty pointless.  Also, the so-called ""surprise"" twist at the end is too phony.  I mean, come on, I guessed right off the bat who the person was doing this.  You have to be blind not to have figured it out.  And not only that, the revelation that is shown about what really happened to the crew is not only uproraringly funny, but downright ridiculous.GHOST SHIP is just a waste of time.  The special features on the DVD are OK, but it will just anger you even more considering how the filmmakers still managed to screw everything up.  Check out the original HALLOWEEN or the original A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET to see how horror is really done.

601716,A34M7WLS58NNJR,B00005JLK0,A Customer,"[7, 10]","I was eagerly awaiting the theatrical release of this movie, just because I had enjoyed Dark Castles's earlier two movies, House On Haunted Hill & 13 Ghosts. So I was pretty disapointed with this third one. But first with the good stuff.1)I have never liked nor disliked Julianna Margulies, and not being an E.R. fan wasn't drawn to this movie because of her. But it turns out she is the shining light in this pretty drab voyage. She brings a nice piece of humanity to the rather dull role of Maureen and makes the whole thing watchable.2) The production values. Some nice effects are on offer as usual with this production company and the digital effects aren't over the top or especially obvious. Nothing ever looks studio bound and the rust and ageing procedure to the ship is handled well. Also of note is the reversal of the ballroom from rust trap to it's former slender - also very well handled.3) The opening massacre - pretty much the only real gore in the movie and pretty cool! A bit CGI-ish though in places, but a nicely directed set piece. Shame there isn't more like it. I also liked the ""romantic"" credits - throws you off nicely and it's different.4) Little Ghost Girl Katie's trip back to explain what happened. Fast paced, energetic and quite harrowing in places.5) The ending, Katie helping Maureen find her way. Again quite touching and nicely shot. Hints of James Cameron here. Made me think that with a slightly different play on the script this could of been a lot better and could of given the director a few more choices as it's obvious he has talent.6) No bad acting!And now for the bad stuff:1) It's about as scary as Mary Poppins cuddling some kitties. And it's not even especially creepy or tense - at all.2) You don't care about any of the characters other than Maureen & Katie. I know this is pretty common for this genre but it can be done and it wonders why such talent as Gabriel Byrne, Ron Eldard and Isaiah Washington sighned up to play such lame roles. A lot of talent was wasted here.3) Kinda dull and unoriginal in general, for this type of movie.Overall I will say I enjoyed it but i really was expecting more, which of course doesn't help. I had hoped it would of been darker and with a few more gore effects. Kinda reminded me of the 'Rose Red' mini series which was all sleek and no substance like this.

So I thought I'd see some really scary movie that will keep me from falling asleep. As it turned out, it did this very efficiently, though not for the scary reasons expected.Make no mistake, this movie is typical escapist entertainment, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with this. And it is pretty good when you come to think of it. The screenplay is well conceived and skilfully executed, with few rather nice surprises and, oh, what a twist in the end. The direction is imaginative and the cast is more than adequate. Visually the movie is quite impressive, with many gorgeous shots of the ghost ship and very decent special effects, particularly the ones in the very end. Apart from one gruesome scene in the beginning, there is nothing really gory, nor scary for that matter, though overall there is a fine tension and suspense during the whole movie.As for the famed similarities with the earlier ""Event Horizon"", they are there but are often unduly emphasised. True, occasionally the later movie does look like a sea ship (as opposed to space ship) variant of earlier one. In both cases an outsider goes with the crew and turns to be more than just a guest; the scene with the collision of the two ships is virtually absolutely the same.

So, I dont really know if the movie would have been different for me (for better or worse).  Actually, I got the movie yesterday.  And I have to say, I like it.  It is not too bad of a movie.I was first introduced to these fellows from House on Haunted Hill.  At first I hated that movie, I thought it was aweful.  Then I watched it a few times and it just kinda clicked to me.  Then I saw Thirteen Ghosts (another remake movie).  It was interesting in the theater, I bought the video and saw it a few more times and decided.  Again.  I liked it.Now this movie.  Hm.  Well yes its not the most original movie out there.  Then again, what is?  I mean, a haunted house is a haunted house, whether its on Gilligan's Island or in Lovecraft's Arkham.Still.  I have to say I like this movie.  It has some obviously wonderful gore effects that are &quot;enjoyable&quot; for their ingenuity. Especially the first scene where ohhhh some 80 or more people got slit in half.  Then there are some more interesting gore effects later on.To me, while there are enough cliche's out there, an effective horror movie is one that captivates me instead of just watching it when I hear the women scream (and guys lol) on the screen.  The movies from Dark Castle, from Haunted Hill to this, are not known for their newness but how they manipulate the old stories into new ways of saying &quot;boo&quot;.If you want to relax after a hard day from work and see a horror movie that you dont have to think every turn of the script while also being captivated enough to see what happens to each character, sure, buy this.

""Ghost Ship"" is about a salvage crew stumbling upon a seemingly derelict cruise liner, the Antonia Graza, that had been mysteriously lost at sea forty years ago. The opening sequence, which definitely is NOT for the faint-hearted, had me squirming in my seat. It started innocently enough - passengers dancing on the deck of the opulent cruise liner on the night it went missing 40 years ago - and then exploded into an unexpected orgy of blood and gore that will probably have me swearing off any thoughts about ever getting on a cruise ship for the rest of my life. The fate of the rest of the passengers and crew was revealed with equal violence and gore about two-thirds through the movie. Although predictable at times, ""Ghost Ship"" did keep me guessing in its first half. Was that mysterious pilot who first approached the salvage crew with information about sightings of the lost cruise liner more than he seemed to be? Was that ghostly girl some sort of demon who caused so much carnage on the ship forty years ago because she was bored? Which ghost had good intentions and which evil? Julianna Margulies acquitted herself well in her role as a strong and gutsy woman with plenty of maternal instincts, the same sort of role so famously pioneered by Sigourney Weaver in Aliens. While ""Ghost Ship""'s premise is not an original one - ""Death Ship"" (1980), ""Event Horizon"" (1997), ""Deep Rising"" (1998) and ""Virus"" (1999) come to mind - it has enough thrills to keep fans of the horror genre happy.

601732,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00005JLK0,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[0, 0]","I was conflicted with how to rate this film. After letting it sink in after viewing it, I knew it was a pretty lousy film and was probably a one star film. But I do enjoy a ghost story, even if it's one that is typical, predictable, and filled with as many cliches as one could imagine being in one film, which pretty much sums up this film. But, because of the creep factor that the film possesses, the great looking ship itself, and the decrepid abyss that eats up the crew inside, I found myself enjoying the look and atmosphere. I always enjoy that kind of stuff. It made for a completely un-surprising film, but there were enough good looking scenes and moments of ghostly activity and kills that made it the guiltiest of guilty pleasures. The film opens with a rather bloody mess. A scene that, while looking incredibly fake and computer generated, was still pretty cool and gruesome. This bloody scene takes place on the italian cruise ship, the Antonia Graza. Skip ahead 40 years and we meet a rag tag salvage crew, captained by Gabriel Byrne. Why was he in this?. Certainly his distinguished career is above doing this movie?. &quot;ER&quot; alumnus Juliana Margulies is also part of the crew, as is Ron Eldard, who is Margulies' real life squeeze. They get an offer from a stranger, played by Desmond Harrington, who has stumbled upon the ghostly wreckage of the Antonia Graza. He convinces the crew to go and salvage the ship. Once they get there, it is obvious from the get go that the place hasn't lost any of it's passengers. Even though the ship has been there, in the Bering Sea, for 40 years. There is nothing new that comes thereafter. Typical hauntings here and there, some rather cool looking and fun, but in the end, expected. The effects are rather underwhelming as well. Nothing special, nothing new. It's one big cliche after another, but darnit, the ciches were okay to look at!. The acting is better than you would normally get in a cheap, cheesy flick like this.

601738,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B00005JLK0,Bobby Underwood,"[3, 3]","This underrated film of a ship found adrift at sea is a blend of modern horror and old-fashioned storytelling. It moves the familiar haunted house story to the ocean with more emphasis on atmosphere and story than most present day horror films. Other than a somewhat gory opening scene the viewer must see as background, there is an understated old-style atmosphere and performances which works well.When a close-knit salvage crew led by Gabriel Byrne agree to go treasure hunting based on photos of an unknown ship drifting deep in the remote Bering Sea, they have no idea what lies ahead. Even the hardened Murphy (Byrne), who has seen strange things at sea, is shocked when what appears and disappears in the dark chilly sea on their radar screens turns out to be the Italian luxury liner Antonia Graza, drifting like a dark and elegant ghost. She is a maritime mystery, vanishing without explanation or trace decades before.Epps (Julianne Marguiles) is the first of the crew to realize something onboard is very wrong, when she sees a sweet young girl who cannot possibly be there. Director Steve Beck does a nice job capturing for the viewer the sense of eerie wonder and anticipation exploring a dark, drifting ship deep in the ocean, thousands of miles from nowhere, brings. As the crew begin to explore the Graza, tension builds and we feel a sense of doom. So does the crew, but just when they are ready to boogie out of there, gold is found, and keeps them aboard.The elegance and style of the original voyage is nicely captured in flashbacks, and adds dimension to the dreary present day salvage operation. Despite the fact this is a horror film of sorts, it is set design rather than special effects which drive it, and make it fun to watch. Marguiles does a nice job, as does Italian beauty Francesca Rettondini in her much too brief flashbacks. Emily Browning, as the young Katie, trying to protect Epps and her crew because she is not like the ""others"" is very good also.The gory flashback which opens the film is more shocking than bloody, but still way too much for younger audiences. It does, however, add to the adult viewer's enjoyment of the story in a way, giving the moviegoer empathy for young Katie's tragic fate. Picked off one by one, she may be the only hope for the remaining. The story has style and is told in an old-fashioned manner. While some elements may be predictable, it is done with understatement and visual flair, making it a fun film in the genre for those who enjoy a good story.",5,Haunting at Sea,1270166400,"04 2, 2010",2010,2522,"['underrated', 'film', 'ship', 'found', 'adrift', 'sea', 'blend', 'modern', 'horror', 'old-fashioned', 'storytelling', 'familiar', 'haunted', 'house', 'story', 'ocean', 'more', 'emphasis', 'atmosphere', 'story', 'most', 'present', 'day', 'horror', 'films', 'Other', 'somewhat', 'gory', 'opening', 'scene', 'viewer', 'must', 'see', 'background', 'understated', 'old-style', 'atmosphere', 'performances', 'well.When', 'close-knit', 'salvage', 'crew', 'led', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'agree', 'go', 'treasure', 'hunting', 'based', 'photos', 'unknown', 'ship', 'drifting', 'deep', 'remote', 'Bering', 'Sea', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'ahead', 'Even', 'hardened', 'Murphy', 'Byrne', 'who', 'seen', 'strange', 'things', 'sea', 'shocked', 'when', 'what', 'dark', 'chilly', 'sea', 'radar', 'screens', 'out', 'be', 'Italian', 'luxury', 'liner', 'Antonia', 'Graza', 'drifting', 'dark', 'elegant', 'ghost', 'maritime', 'mystery', 'vanishing', 'explanation', 'trace', 'decades', 'before.Epps', 'Julianne', 'Marguiles', 'first', 'crew', 'realize', 'something', 'onboard', 'very', 'wrong', 'when', 'sweet', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'be', 'there', 'Director', 'Steve', 'Beck', 'nice', 'job', 'capturing', 'viewer', 'sense', 'eerie', 'wonder', 'anticipation', 'exploring', 'dark', 'drifting', 'ship', 'deep', 'ocean', 'thousands', 'miles', 'nowhere', 'brings', 'crew', 'begin', 'explore', 'Graza', 'tension', 'builds', 'feel', 'sense', 'doom', 'So', 'crew', 'just', 'when', 'are', 'ready', 'boogie', 'gold', 'found', 'aboard.The', 'elegance', 'style', 'original', 'voyage', 'nicely', 'captured', 'flashbacks', 'dimension', 'dreary', 'present', 'day', 'salvage', 'operation', 'fact', 'horror', 'film', 'sorts', 'set', 'design', 'rather', 'special', 'effects', 'drive', 'make', 'fun', 'watch', 'Marguiles', 'nice', 'job', 'Italian', 'beauty', 'Francesca', 'Rettondini', 'much', 'too', 'brief', 'flashbacks', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'young', 'Katie', 'trying', 'protect', 'Epps', 'crew', 'not', 'others', 'very', 'good', 'also.The', 'gory', 'flashback', 'film', 'more', 'shocking', 'bloody', 'still', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'younger', 'audiences', 'however', 'add', 'adult', 'viewer', 'enjoyment', 'story', 'way', 'giving', 'moviegoer', 'empathy', 'young', 'Katie', 'tragic', 'fate', 'Picked', 'one', 'one', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'hope', 'remaining', 'story', 'style', 'told', 'old-fashioned', 'manner', 'elements', 'may', 'be', 'predictable', 'done', 'understatement', 'visual', 'flair', 'making', 'fun', 'film', 'genre', 'who', 'enjoy', 'good', 'story']",N/A

GHOST SHIP  pits a salvage crew against a ship full of vengeful ghosts that seek to drive out the evil spirit that has tied them to the vessel. This tiresome take on the Old Dark House motif drags forward as the characters wander aimlessly through the ship's dark corridors with no rewarding suspense or bloodshed. An unforgettable opening sequence in which an entire dance floor of passengers is bisected by one of the ship's suspension cables promises fast-paced action and gore that never arrives. Instead, the audience is bludgeoned by one safe PG-13 death after another, hits that are not softened by the poor computerized FX or make-up work. The characters can only be judged from most annoying to least annoying, none of whom draw the least bit of sympathy or support as they are lined up only to be knocked down. Beck's heavy metal soundtrack and music video styling suggests that the film was geared directly towards turning a quick teen buck in its theatrical run, with no intent on creating a lasting effect on the viewer.

601748,A21T2ZAT0QA0KO,B00005JLK0,ChildInside,"[1, 3]","To start off, the movie had a pretty good beginning. I must say that the beginning is one of the more unique set-up scenes I've seen. However, despite the good beginning, the movie did not generally go well. Before we go into that, though, let me tell you the premise of the movie. A ship that has disappeared for 40+ years finally re-emerged. A man found it and wishes to hire a crew to help him salvage it. After some negotiating, they finally set off to see the ship. They discover things they don't like. You know, like every horror movie.Now, the reason why the movie did not go well is because it ruins any great twist right off. One of the first things you'll noticed in this movie is this little girl. Now when the ship was met with disaster, she was shown as the only one who wasn't affected, but soon afterwards, it showed that it didn't matter anyway. That little girl could have been used an excellent twist, but the director decided not to for some reason. Aside from that, the way they revealed this ruined the horror factor too.Lets face it, like many people have said for centuries now, it is the darkness (or unknown, if you will) that scares us. If we are shown what we're facing, we will no longer be afraid. It is the fact that we have to guess when our minds run wild and we scare ourselves. This is why movies like House On Haunted Hill (remake) and many others like it are so scary. It keeps us guessing. To make it better, HOHH only tease us with disturbing images. When the first ghost appears in the movie (and it is quite early in the movie, I assure you), it doesn't even look like the dead. It looks like one of those corny kind of ghosts you would see in movies years ago. You all know what I'm talking about, it's nothing more than the actor with make-up to make the skin look paler.It was so laughable that I scoff. You see, that will be a continuous problem throughout the movie. What it seriously lack is subtlety. It lacks a plot that makes us wonder. It also lacks scary things. The kind of ghosts you'll see all throughout this movie are just the regular actors, except with paler skin. What kind of BS is that? Tie this in with the fact that every creepy thing that happens is a direct action of ghosts makes the horror factor horribly low. In other horror movies, directors try to off-set this by making the door close coincidentally or through some other method. You know that there is a supernatural force behind it, but there is just enough to leave doubt in your head. This movie does not do that at all.Another huge HUGE problem in this movie is the lack of connection you have with the characters, The closest thing you'll come to a come to a connection is with Jack, who clearly does not know anything about salvaging or being a sailor. He generally seems like a normal person, but he soon turns into the classical jerk bad guy we've all come to know. The problem is that he showed no indication of that kind of personality beforehand. Needless to say, his acting is not exactly top quality, but the script doesn't seem to be much better. Greer seems to show some kind of normal behavior, but the rest seems...how should I say this....stereotypical. Yes, that's the word, stereotypical.One more massive problem is the plot holes. Now, almost every movie has plot holes, but how many has them glaring in your face? This movie certainly had a few. One of the biggest ones is when the crew start asking about research on the boat. Maybe I'm just ignorant, but how the hell do you find information about a boat that disappeared for decades? And no, I'm not thinking about basic information like passengers number, when it was created, or etc. I'm talking about details like possible leakages, how sturdy it is, and that kind of thing. How do you find information like that about a boat that has been missing for decades? Another plot hole is that Epps somehow seemed to have figure out one of the ghost's name without anyone telling her. Maybe I just missed it, but how did she do it?And what's to top off all these problems? Some of the horror scenes actually made me laughed. I'm dead serious. During one of the scenes, I couldn't help but laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. This movie is just SO horribly cliche. I'm telling you all, it's almost like a ghost movie you would see in the 1980's. I was more scared by The Ghost And Mr. Chicken than this movie!However, I must admittedly say that the movie does get incredibly cool near the end, especially when everything is revealed. It returns to its rather strange uniqueness again and you get this awesome scene that plays out almost like a ultra fast pace gangster movie. It's strange, yet it's really cool. However, this really cool scene ends on a bad note. It ends on a bad note because it reveals a plot twist that I had expected all along. Maybe you guys would not guess it, but unfortunately, I did. I gotta say, though, this plot twist eventually turned into one of the corniest twist of any modern horror movie I've seen. Once again, it's like something from the 1980's. The ending is slightly cool, but nothing really truly special.Could the director honestly have thought he was making a horror movie or was this what he attended? Surely it must not have been former considering he put in Mudvayne's ""Not Falling"" in. Marilyn Manson's ""Sweet Dreams"" is scary, Mudvayne's ""Not Falling"" is not. However, some of you may consider it scary since it was the track played when we were introduced to the end, which implied a possible sequel. Really, this movie seemed like it would have been a better action movie. If you're looking for a scare, just ignore this movie.",2,This movie is not scary....at all....,1103760000,"12 23, 2004",2004,5673,"['start', 'off', 'movie', 'had', 'pretty', 'good', 'beginning',

Anyway, while a number of passengers and crew are cutting a rug on one of the decks, there's an unfortunate accident (or is it?) with an overly taut steel cable resulting in nearly everyone on the deck (except for a little red-headed girl, played by Emily Browning) being literally cut down in size.  Fast forward to the present where we meet a crew of professional sea salvagers, led by a man named Murphy (Byrne).  Among the crew is Murphy's right hand, a woman named Epps (Margulies), divers Dodge (Eldard) and Munder (Urban), first mate Greer (Washington), and Santos (Dimitriades), the mechanic.  After a recently successful haul the group is approached by a man named Jack Ferriman (Harrington) with a proposition.  Seems Ferriman, a pilot of sorts, knows the location of a derelict ship, and wants Murphy and his crew to salvage it, with a percentage of the take going to himself.  After agreeing on terms they locate the ship they learn it's actually the Antonia Graza (given the ship's rusty condition it should probably be renamed the USS Tetanus), an Italian ocean liner missing for the last forty some odd years (it also happens to be the same ship we saw at the beginning...big surprise).  Anyhow, as the crew begins its reconnaissance, a subtle strangeness sets in, indicating perhaps they're not alone (the red-headed girl we saw at the beginning appears and disappears).  The crew gets a little jittery, but their fears are temporarily waylaid after finding a fortune in gold in the cargo hold, to which they decide to forgo trying to save the ship (which is severely damaged and sinking), and make off with the gold...sounds like a plan, but forces conspire to keep them on the derelict ship, where they eventually discover some disturbing truths about what happened to those previously aboard the Antonia Graza...It's probably worth mentioning up front the opening sequence is pretty gory, so if you've a weak stomach or easily disgusted, you may want to skip the film.  Once past this, there's not much else that comes close to this level of nastiness.  While the opening bit didn't bother me, it seemed odd (and unnecessary) its inclusion given I was expecting more of a traditional, psychological type ghost story.  Well, it turns out the director Steve Beck, has a background in special effects, so I guess he wanted to start off the film with something he knew...and speaking of effects, I think that's probably one element many people who've seen this film can agree on is that the special effects tend to drive the movie more than anything else.  One aspect I found especially strong was the settings as it appeared there was a whole lot of effort involved in creating atmosphere in terms of the Antonia Graza.  As far as the other elements of the film, the story, the script, the performances, well, I really wasn't impressed.  I just never felt the sense of dread I would hope to feel in a solid ghost story, which is, in my opinion, what this feature strives to be...the story, while containing some interesting aspects (along with some serious plot holes), fell a little flat, the script was pretty minimal (which was more a positive than a negative), and the performances barely there and a bit too artificial (laced with a whole lot of machismo), but this may have been due to the skimpy material the actors were given.  The film does sometimes move a little too slow as the intent seemed to be a build up towards some not so juicy revelations (often shown in flashbacks), but I thought most of the characters not very interesting so spending time with them felt almost a chore (once they started getting knocked off I felt very little empathy for them).  There was one shining moment well into the feature and that when an Italian actress named Francesca Rettondini shows us the goods (specifically her goods) that helped make the overall experience somewhat more worthwhile.  All in all this isn't a rotten film, but I just wish the writers had put as much effort into the story as the filmmakers put into the effects.While the actual film may not have been all that hot, the picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1), looks beautiful and sharply detailed, and the Dolby Surround 5.1 audio, available in both English and French comes across well.  There's a good helping of extras including a making of documentary (15:05), a visual FX featurette (6:01), a featurette titled A Closer Look at the Gore (5:30), another focusing on the design of the ghost ship (5:44), a music video featuring the band Mudvayne and their song `Not Falling', which was used in the film, a puzzle game titled `Secrets of the Antonia Graza', cast and crew filmographies, a theatrical trailer, and subtitles in English, French, and Spanish.  Also, the DVD case features a nifty holographic type image on the cover.Cookieman108",3,"""I think I saw something I couldn't have possibly have seen.""",1160611200,"10 12, 2006",2006,5778,"['Old',

601752,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005JLK0,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 5]","A lot of horror fans don't think too highly of this film, but I quite enjoyed my time on the Ghost Ship.  Maybe there's nothing too original or ground-breaking about the type of horror it has to offer, but that doesn't mean it's not effective and entertaining.  Certainly, believability is a weakness in a few spots, and I'm still trying to figure out how a couple of ""facts"" could have been even remotely possible, but the film does create an eerie atmosphere and doesn't mind spilling a little blood in pursuit of its ends.I think I can safely say that the opening scene of the movie is rather unforgettable, and I greatly admire the effect the moviemakers were going for here.  Rarely does a movie purport to take out untold scores of people with one swift blow, and it is most unfortunate that a lack of commitment to this potentially extraordinary scene sets in motion the very doubts and misgivings some viewers have of the real meat of the story.  The method of mass execution used in this first scene is pretty hard to accept scientifically, but the real problem comes in the form of some very obvious mannequins lying among the ""dead.""  The filmmakers try to salvage the scene by having the victims take a few moments to figure out that they are quite dead, and that works for me; unfortunately, they take this too far and end up making what should be a glorious bloodbath look a little silly.The real story here concerns the crew of a salvage boat hired to salvage a mysterious old ship that a pilot claims to have spotted in the Bering Sea.  What they find is an Italian ocean liner missing for forty years, but the great riches they discover onboard lead not to the paradise on earth they fantasize about but rather its exact opposite.  Trapped on board the dead vessel, each crew member must fight to stay alive and sane in an environment which quickly shows itself to be quite haunted indeed.  The fates of a few are rather hokey and predictable, but the storyline around one little girl ghost saves the movie in my opinion.  Only Maureen Epps (Julianna Margulies) can see little Katie (played quite effectively by Emily Browning), who eventually tells her the story of what happened forty years ago.  This little girl, a pure-hearted ghost trapped on a ship full of malevolent spirits, certainly does her share to give the movie the creepy aura it needs.  The major flashback we see through the eyes of Katie, though, is just plain weird.  As we are transported back forty years in time, we are suddenly bombarded by some type of hard-driving, neo-tech electronic music that seems wholly out of place.I'm not saying Ghost Ship does not have its faults and weaknesses, but in my opinion it made for an entertaining albeit rather predictable little horror movie.  Some people seem to hate the ending, but I had no problem with it whatsoever; I think it worked quite well in the context of everything I had just seen.  I would not call Ghost Ship a must-see horror film by any means, nor do I personally consider it all that gory, but I do think it has enough chills and thrills to satisfy or at least entertain many a horror fan out there.",4,"Flawed and predictable, yet I have to say I liked it",1061596800,"08 23, 2003",2003,3152,"['lot', 'horror', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'too', 'highly', 'film', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'time', 'Ghost', 'Ship', 'Maybe', 'nothing', 'too', 'original', 'ground-breaking', 'type', 'horror', 'offer', ""n't"", 'mean', 'not', 'effective', 'entertaining', 'Certainly', 'believability', 'weakness', 'few', 'spots', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'couple', 'facts', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'remotely', 'possible', 'film', 'create', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', ""n't"", 'mind', 'spilling', 'little', 'blood', 'pursuit', 'ends.I', 'think', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'opening', 'scene', 'movie', 'rather', 'unforgettable', 'greatly', 'admire', 'effect', 'moviemakers', 'were', 'going', 'here', 'Rarely', 'movie', 'purport', 'take', 'out', 'untold', 'scores', 'people', 'one', 'swift', 'blow', 'most', 'unfortunate', 'lack', 'commitment', 'potentially', 'extraordinary', 'scene', 'sets', 'motion', 'very', 'doubts', 'viewers', 'have', 'real', 'meat', 'story', 'method', 'mass', 'execution', 'used', 'first', 'scene', 'pretty', 'hard', 'accept', 'scientifically', 'real', 'problem', 'form', 'very', 'obvious', 'mannequins', 'lying', 'dead', 'filmmakers', 'try', 'salvage', 'scene', 'having', 'victims', 'take', 'few', 'moments', 'figure', 'out', 'are', 'quite', 'dead', 'unfortunately', 'take', 'too', 'far', 'end', 'up', 'making', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'glorious', 'bloodbath', 'look', 'little', 'silly.The', 'real', 'story', 'here', 'crew', 'salvage', 'boat', 'hired', 'salvage', 'mysterious', 'old', 'ship', 'pilot', 'claims', 'have', 'spotted', 'Bering', 'Sea', 'What', 'find', 'Italian', 'ocean', 'liner', 'missing', 'forty', 'years', 'great', 'riches', 'discover', 'onboard', 'lead', 'not', 'paradise', 'earth', 'fantasize', 'rather', 'exact', 'opposite', 'Trapped', 'board', 'dead', 'vessel', 'crew', 'member', 'must', 'fight', 'stay', 'alive', 'sane', 'environment', 'quickly', 'be', 'quite', 'haunted', 'indeed', 'fates', 'few', 'are', 'rather', 'hokey', 'predictable', 'storyline', 'one', 'little', 'girl', 'ghost', 'movie', 'opinion', 'Only', 'Maureen', 'Epps', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', 'can', 'see', 'little', 'Katie', 'played', 'quite', 'effectively', 'Emily', 'Browning', 'who', 'eventually', 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'little', 'girl', 'pure-hearted', 'ghost', 'trapped', 'ship', 'full', 'malevolent', 'spirits', 'certainly', 'share', 'give', 'movie', 'creepy', 'major', 'flashback', 'see', 'eyes', 'Katie', 'though', 'just', 'plain', 'weird', 'are', 'transported', 'back', 'forty', 'years', 'time', 'are', 'suddenly', 'bombarded', 'type', 'hard-driving', 'neo-tech', 'electronic', 'music', 'wholly', 'place.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Ghost', 'Ship', 'not', 'have', 'faults', 'weaknesses', 'opinion', 'made', 'entertaining', 'albeit', 'rather', 'predictable', 'little', 'horror', 'movie', 'people', 'seem', 'hate', 'ending', 'had', 'problem', 'think', 'worked', 'quite', 'well', 'context', 'everything', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'would', 'not', 'call', 'Ghost', 'Ship', 'must-see', 'horror', 'film', 'means', 'do', 'personally', 'consider', 'gory', 'do', 'think', 'enough', 'chills', 'thrills', 'satisfy', 'least', 'entertain', 'many', 'horror', 'fan', 'there']",N/A
601753,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B00005JLK0,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[3, 5]","For as long as man has slapped together sturdy, seaworthy craft and pitched out across the Earth's black seas, there have been legends of ghost ships, tales of brigantines and merchant-men that have disappeared, only to turn up months or years later: abandoned, no sign of struggle, decks left neat, hatches battened, crew gone.The tale of old Captain Van der Gelder and his Flying Dutchman haunted the minds of sea captains and inspired an opera by Richard Wagner, and maritime legendry is rich with tales of the Marie Celeste (which plays a brief role in this film), the Andrea Doria, and even the Titanic, which has become a ghost ship of sorts, its supple staterooms hosting fat white sea-slugs and sharks instead of tycoons.With this in mind, I was looking forward to ""Ghost Ship"", which has all the ingredients of a good haunted house story: a mysterious (and shocking, right from the lurid opening sequences) tragedy aboard the Italian luxury ocean-liner Antonia Graz; the sighting of the monstrous, rusting hulk in the Bering Strait 40 years after its disappearance; and a slap-dash rush by a band of salvagers to get to the hulk and tow it back to port in Anchorage.Oh, not to mention the fact that the movie is helmed by Steve Beck, who may not be the most profound director, but as 13 Ghosts proved, is not a fellow who is shy about gore.So you've got a haunted ghost ship in the north Pacific, you've got great shiploads of goop in the cargo hold, you've got a nasty little decades-old sub-plot of murder and greed and treachery, and you've got some excellent actors (among them Gabriel Byrne and Julianna Margulies). What's not to like about ""Ghost Ship""?Actually, there's a lot to like about this little film, which is sleek, well-shot, occasionally very creepy, has solid acting and a decent story, and possibly the most masterful gore-effects I've seen in the last 5 years. And best of all, most of the gore and special effects is hand-made, and (blessedly!) not the cheap CGI that ruined other enjoyable creature features like ""Deep Rising"".When the salvage team boards the rusting Antonia Graz, all the lifeboats are gone, as well as the anchors---and that's not all. The story itself seems to have been jettisoned: while there is a nasty little plot (the tale of betrayal and murder is well told and awfully grisly), once the salvage guys turn up the movie turns into a little supernatural murder-by-numbers flick, so predictable that you can guess who is going to get it---and when, and how.And the climax, which should have been terrifying, seems grafted on; besides which the villain, who should have been literally diabolic (perhaps Gabriel Byrne?), is far too bland to be frightening.But let's get back to why ""Ghost Ship"" merits a look: the special effects in the movie are visionary, some of the best I've seen in a horror film. There is a little nugget in the DVD extras called ""A closer look at the Gore"" which is worth the price of admission alone.And really, the opening sequence is worth the price of admission: it is incredibly well done and brilliantly edited, an entire sequence in which director Beck probably stepped away from the camera and gave the film over to the special effects guys. The scene is so lurid, so gory, and so disturbing, that I found myself still thinking about it days after I saw the movie. If you've seen ""13 Ghosts"" and remember what Beck did with the lawyer, this is about 100 times as good (or bad, depending on your gore-threshold).All in all, ""Ghost Ship"" is a great little nugget of gloriously gory horror that is slightly undermined by a story that feels cobbled together. The movie isn't frightening, but it is stylish. Like most modern cruises, ""Ghost Ship"" is great for a visit---but you wouldn't want to live there.JSG",3,The Hate Boat,1111968000,"03 28, 2005",2005,3788,"['as', 'long', 'man', 'slapped', 'together', 'sturdy', 'seaworthy', 'craft', 'pitched', 'out', 'Earth', 'black', 'seas', 'have', 'been', 'legends', 'ghost', 'ships', 'tales', 'brigantines', 'merchant-men', 'have', 'disappeared', 'only', 'turn', 'up', 'months', 'years', 'later', 'abandoned', 'sign', 'struggle', 'decks', 'left', 'neat', 'hatches', 'battened', 'crew', 'gone.The', 'tale', 'old', 'Captain', 'Van', 'der', 'Gelder', 'Flying', 'Dutchman', 'haunted', 'minds', 'sea', 'captains', 'inspired', 'opera', 'Richard', 'Wagner', 'maritime', 'legendry', 'rich', 'tales', 'Marie', 'Celeste', 'brief', 'role', 'film', 'Andrea', 'Doria', 'even', 'Titanic', 'become', 'ghost', 'ship', 'sorts', 'supple', 'staterooms', 'hosting', 'fat', 'white', 'sea-slugs', 'sharks', 'instead', 'tycoons.With', 'mind', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'Ghost', 'Ship', 'ingredients', 'good', 'haunted', 'house', 'story', 'mysterious', 'shocking', 'right', 'lurid', 'opening', 'sequences', 'tragedy', 'Italian', 'luxury', 'ocean-liner', 'Antonia', 'Graz', 'sighting', 'monstrous', 'rusting', 'hulk', 'Bering', 'Strait', '40', 'years', 'disappearance', 'slap-dash', 'rush', 'band', 'salvagers', 'get', 'hulk', 'tow', 'back', 'port', 'Anchorage.Oh', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'movie', 'helmed', 'Steve', 'Beck', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'profound', 'director', '13', 'Ghosts', 'proved', 'not', 'fellow', 'who', 'shy', 'gore.So', ""'ve"", 'got', 'haunted', 'ghost', 'ship', 'north', 'Pacific', ""'ve"", 'got', 'great', 'shiploads', 'goop', 'cargo', 'hold', ""'ve"", 'got', 'nasty', 'little', 'decades-old', 'sub-plot', 'murder', 'greed', 'treachery', ""'ve"", 'got', 'excellent', 'actors', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', 'What', 'not', 'like', 'Ghost', 'Ship', 'Actually', 'lot', 'like', 'little', 'film', 'sleek', 'well-shot', 'occasionally', 'very', 'creepy', 'solid', 'acting', 'decent', 'story', 'possibly', 'most', 'masterful', 'gore-effects', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'last', '5', 'years', 'best', 'most', 'gore', 'special', 'effects', 'hand-made', 'blessedly', 'not', 'cheap', 'CGI', 'ruined', 'other', 'enjoyable', 'creature', 'features', 'Deep', 'Rising', 'salvage', 'team', 'rusting', 'Antonia', 'Graz', 'lifeboats', 'are', 'gone', 'as', 'well', 'anchors', '-and', 'not', 'story', 'have', 'been', 'jettisoned', 'nasty', 'little', 'plot', 'tale', 'betrayal', 'murder', 'well', 'told', 'awfully', 'grisly', 'once', 'salvage', 'guys', 'turn', 'up', 'movie', 'little', 'supernatural', 'murder-by-numbers', 'flick', 'so', 'predictable', 'can', 'guess', 'who', 'going', 'get', '-and', 'when', 'climax', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'terrifying', 'grafted', 'besides', 'villain', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'literally', 'diabolic', 'perhaps', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'far', 'too', 'bland', 'be', 'frightening.But', 'let', 'get', 'back', 'why', 'Ghost', 'Ship', 'look', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'are', 'visionary', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'horror', 'film', 'little', 'nugget', 'DVD', 'extras', 'called', 'A', 'closer', 'look', 'Gore', 'price', 'admission', 'alone.And', 'really', 'opening', 'sequence', 'price', 'admission', 'incredibly', 'well', 'done', 'brilliantly', 'edited', 'entire', 'sequence', 'director', 'Beck', 'probably', 'stepped', 'away', 'camera', 'gave', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'guys', 'scene', 'so', 'lurid', 'so', 'gory', 'so', 'disturbing', 'found', 'still', 'thinking', 'days', 'saw', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', '13', 'Ghosts', 'remember', 'what', 'Beck', 'did', 'lawyer', 'about', '100', 'times', 'as', 'good', 'bad', 'depending', 'gore-threshold', '.All', 'Ghost', 'Ship', 'great', 'little', 'nugget', 'gloriously', 'gory', 'horror', 'slightly', 'undermined', 'story', 'cobbled', 'together', 'movie', ""n't"", 'frightening', 'stylish', 'most', 'modern', 'cruises', 'Ghost', 'Ship', 'great', 'visit', '-but', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'live', 'there.JSG']",N/A

One stormy night, they come across the ship, almost out of nowhere, and it turns out to be none other than the Antonio Graza, an Italian cruise ship lost at sea in 1962.  The crew's captain recalls that every salvage crew around the world has been looking for this ship and its cargo of gold bars.  Eerie things start to happen, such as the sighting of a young girl, music replacing the chatter on the walkie talkies, a digital watch found in the helm.  Soon, the salvage crew is fighting for their lives against the evil forces at work in the ship.This is a decent movie, if somewhat predictable.  Julianna Margulies (as Maureen Epps) and Emily Browning (as Katie Hargrove) are both quite good and wind up being the only characters I cared about.  What really stands out in this movie are the special effects and the creepy atmosphere of the ship.  The opening sequence alone is quite ingenious and sets the mood for the enitre film.  The interior of the ship itself is dark and gloomy, and ranges from narrow, claustrophobic hallways to cavernous, tomb-like rooms.Also, some of the extras on the DVD are worth watching, such as the featurette about how all the gore sequences were created.

601775,A3BWP965RIWBCU,B00005JLK0,"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker""","[0, 0]","A lot of reviews of the various DVD and VHS editions of this chilling film have appeared. Some folks are snobs about the ""horror film"" genre, not one for which I have myself much taste to see regularly, since the supernatural tends to spook me out too easily. Frankly, what attracted me initially to this movie is the seafaring aspect. I love the lore of big 19th and 20th century powered ships, especially really large ones, military or civilian, such as the Antonia Graza, the ocean-liner featured in the fictional ""Ghost Ship"". I served as a sailor in the U.S. Navy (something that awakened me, as early as my late teens, to the sheer dastardliness of both the U. S. of A.`s and Britain`s imperialist ventures abroad), most of the time on a ship that was at sea a good deal in all kinds of conditions in all parts of the Alantic, Artic, and Indian Oceans (and in Antarctic waters, too); I was only at sea specifically in the Pacific during those years very briefly, on a quite large vessel (a supply ship that also served as a troop transport vessel) before being transferred to the Atlantic Fleet. These ships dated from years of construction and/or refitting roughly contemporaneous with that of the film's Antonia Graza. I was in a position to see all parts of the ship on which I served longest quite often, more so than most of the seamen of the crew, since my labours took me from the bilge right up to the top of the rigging quite a lot. That was mostly on a relatively small ship (a destroyer), so I really love seeing films of grandiose, humongous vessels such as the Antonia Graza of this movie.All of the foregoing is simply to attest to my ability to size up the authenticity of the ship portrayal in this film (not to make a lot here of my few years of seafaring). The detail is well-nigh flawless! I usually had no difficulty recognising in what parts of the ship the action occurs at any time or what the machinery therein is. One cannot say that of all films, let me tell! This is a beautifully, very skillfully, and evocatively filmed work of cinema. It also is very suspenseful and exciting! I have to admit that re-seeing it after the initial time makes the action and motivations clearer to me. One needs to watch the film carefully to understand in every detail what is happening, the people (live or ghostly) as well as what is around them.

The group of people I watched it with had everybody pegged for their fates long before anything happened, but yet, we all still enjoyed it.  In a superficial, let's eat popcorn and have a non-cerebral evening type of way, this movie was A LOT of fun.My advice?  Don't think too much and just go with it.  Ghost Ship will take you for a predicatable thriller ride.  It's about a group of people that specialize in recovering shipwrecks and pirating their contents.  They learn of a mysterious ship that disappeared back in the 60's and they go seek it out at the recommendation of the newest crewmen.  Needless to say, they find it.  From there, the story spins out of control - people die, people live, people drown.A couple of interesting points . . .*The first few minutes of the movie get you interested right away.  In a macabre, gross, OH MY GAWD THAT DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN sort of way, the opening scene sets the whole mood.*There are quite a few scenes reminiscent of Kubrick's The Shining (my friends and I kept screaming, ""Don't do it Jack!"")  I'm not sure if it's a style thing or a plot thing or both, but Gabriel Byrne's character was a throwback to Jack Torrance.  One way or another, the script writer and director had some inspiration.*Ghost Ship has one of the BEST action/horror sequences I've seen in years.  The little girl onboard is helping Julianna Margulies' character, and she 'shows' her what made the ship go all spooky-like.  It's a solid few minutes of gore, but it's intense and the soundtrack is perfectly played in time to the actions.  We squealed, we laughed, we winced.  It was great - the highlight of the entire movie.So all in all, I liked this.  Yes, I know I shouldn't have, but I did.

Among the better of these schlockfests was Ghost Ship, a maritime horror set in the bleak Bearing Straight. A salvage crew featuring the underused Gabriel Byrne (replacing Brian Cox) and the lovely Julianna Margulies set out on a mission to find a mysterious floating behemoth only to discover that it's the 40-year lost Antonia Garza, a cruise ship that vanished without a trace.Once on board the salvage crew quickly begin to realize that something sinister is going on and have doubts about the completing their mission. The rusting juggernaut holds a terrifying secret and will not let them leave under any circumstances. It's an ironic morality play with a twist, much in the style of the producers' own Tales from the Crypt TV/movie series. Dark Castle were good at making this type of film, but they've shifted focus in recent years. Despite a little too much CGI blood effects, Ghost Ship still manages to be chilling and provokes a dreadful atmosphere.But where did all the dead bodies go?If you like this film then you ought to check out the similar Death Ship and Deep Rising.

The twist in the plot happens about halfway through, and I admit I didn't see it coming.Perhaps these days, everyone thinks ""Friday the 13th"" slasher films when they think horror. Today's films are ""in your face"" with gore.But Ghost Ship is more subtle in its frights, and its attraction is the effective use of atmosphere...and...it actually has a plot. The acting is good, especially the little girl on the ship, who is very convincing and rather sad, creating empathy for her.Even though there is a small bit of blood in the beginning of the film, most of this movie concentrates on very effective, creepy ghosts. When the ghost captain sits at a table drinking with the mortal captain of the tug boat, it produced a really chilling effect.If you are seeking a gore fest, move on. But if you miss the old-fashioned haunted house tales (except this takes place on a ship), then give Ghost Ship a try. I was very pleasantly surprised at how good this movie is.

601791,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00005JLK0,Jeffrey Leach,"[19, 31]","""Ghost Ship"" is one of those films that draw you in because the basic idea sounds great. An outfit of ship salvagers out of Alaska receives a tip from a man named Ferriman about a mysterious ship that suddenly appeared in the middle of the Bering Strait. On closer examination, the ship turns out to be the Antonia Graza, an Italian cruise liner lost since the early 1960s. The salvage crew gets immensely excited because the ship promises millions in finder's fees. The eventual discovery of gold bars on the ship promises even more wealth, in the 200-300 million dollar range. Regrettably, a few small problems arise during the exploration of the rusted hulk of the ship. The salvage tug blows up under mysterious circumstances, killing one of the crew and leaving the surviving members trapped on the abandoned ship. Even worse, several of the other salvagers encounter eerie ghosts wandering the Antonia Graza, ghosts who seem to take a serious interest in keeping them on board permanently. Top this off with the discovery of a hole in the hull of the ship which promises to sink not only the dreams of the salvage operation but cost them their lives as well and you have the fundamental premise of this horror film. As great as this idea sounds, ""Ghost Ship"" fails on nearly every level. Bad acting, a bad script, a bad soundtrack, ineffective gore, and a lack of interesting characters plague this film at every step.Let's start with the gore. The film opens with a flashback about what happened to the passengers on the Antonia Graza. A dance party is underway on the deck, with lots of rich Europeans hobnobbing and generally having a good time. Suddenly, an incredibly bloody encounter with a wire leaves the deck awash in red. The scene is imaginative, of that there is no doubt, but the special effects are rather tepid. An event like this, if it really happened, would result in a veritable tidal wave of the sticky stuff. Instead, we get some lame mannequins and blood that is far too bright (and in insufficient quantities) to prove convincing. Additional scenes, including an unpleasant encounter with a hook, are equally unimpressive and too sparing with the sauce. In an extra on the DVD, the special effects team discusses how they created these scenes for the movie, and one of the guys was wearing a Tom Savini T-shirt. I found myself wishing Savini had done the effects for ""Ghost Ship."" They would have been much better.With the presence of Julianna Margulies, Ron Eldard, and Gabriel Byrne, you would think the acting might give ""Ghost Ship"" a boost. Think again. It is unlikely any high-powered actor or actress could have salvaged much from this plodding script. Byrne sleepwalks his way through his role as captain of the salvaging crew, and Margulies is superficial in the ""tough chick doing the guy thing"" role that has been done to death in recent years. Eldard fades into the background as one of the welders on the operation, reduced to sneering and laughing his way through the part. The lesser characters are even more forgettable. I think the biggest problem I had with this film involved the acting and the characters because I quickly realized that I didn't like any of them. The macho image projected by all of the characters made me completely indifferent to their individual fates. It's tough to work up any sympathy when characters that are jerks die off in a movie, and every character here is a jerk.One benefit of seeing ""Ghost Ship"" on DVD is the plethora of extras. There is plenty of stuff here for the curious viewer. You can watch a documentary containing actor interviews, a documentary on the special effects, a little ""game"" where you find four short clips with extra information about the cruise ship, and the usual spate of filmographies on cast and crew. But even here there are problems: An ""interview"" with Francesca, the ghostly singer on the cruise liner, is laughable due to her cheesy Italian accent (the actress is actually Italian and it STILL sounds cheesy and unbelievable) and the gauzy camera shots of her dressing for a performance. The tone of this extra footage made me feel as though I was watching one of those international coffee commercials.I should also mention the soundtrack and cinematography of the film. The long arm of ""The Matrix"" reaches into the depths of the Antonia Graza, with wildly inappropriate bursts of techno music mixed with the type of jarring camera shots I've come to hate with a passion. I wish filmmakers would quit using gimmicks for no other reason than gimmickry's sake. It adds nothing to character development and is offensive to someone who actually has an attention span that lasts longer than three seconds.With a host of insurmountable flaws to overcome, ""Ghost Ship"" founders on the shores of banality. Anyone looking for effective scares, intriguing characters, and a plot without holes that you couldn't sail an ocean liner through will need to look elsewhere. I fervently pray that no salvage team attempts to raise the wreck that is ""Ghost Ship.""",2,"Lost at Sea, and Hopefully Never Found",1053993600,"05 27, 2003",2003,5060,"['Ghost', 'Ship', 'one',

Just as an example, ""Ghost ship"" is very similar to two recent movies of the same kind: ""Hause on haunted hill"" and ""Deep blue sea"". Even the proportions of the ethnic origin of the actors are the same in these movies.""Ghost ship"" 's plot is: a group of ship rescuers (they won't do anything if there's not any money involved, of course) lead by Gabriel Byrne is approached by a young man who claims to have seen from the air an abandoned oceanliner. When they get there, Byrne discovers it is the ""Antonio Grazi"", a ship that was reported missing since 1962. That's when the team discovers a hidden treasure and strange things begin to happen. OK, everybody knew what the plot was.So let me say other things about the film: the first scenes are very well-though and well-made and, like other reviewers, I thought I was in the wrong movie. The first mass-killing scenes are also good. The story is full of flaws and some highly-unbelieving death scenes. The prodution of the movie is competent and Steve Beck is a regular director, but knows how to keep the audience paying attention to the screen without laughing too much.

I just wanted to see Julianna Margulies in an earlier role. In ""Ghost Ship"" (2003) Margulies displays that central brace of calmness of character in the face of danger that she so deftly shows weekly in her role asThe Good Wife: The First Season, one of the finest series to ever air on network television.I know Margulies as the stoic, loyal, stalworth Alicia, but one who has a secret heart. On this salvage ship she plays a similar character who loses her cool when ghosts make themselves known. It is kind of good to see this character scream like a little girl when faced with ghosts. Even reassuring. Maybe she is one of us.The ghost ship was reputedly lost at sea during the previous century and harbors more gold than the crew can possibly ever imagine spending. Margulies and the captain (the dark, handsome Gabriel Byrnne) want to tow the ship to a safe place where they can safely claim it before it sinks.The trick of the ship--and it is tricked out with ghosts--is to set one particular ghost per crew member, just the one who will tempt the living one into taking chances and dying. It's an interesting premise. The Margulies character gets a child, the captain gets the captain, a lonely man gets the sultry singer, and so on. However, the child tells the tale of what happened lo, those many years ago when betrayal first set the boat's destiny into action. Greed and betrayal, murder and mayhem, an old, old story.The Margulies character sets out to break the cycle of temptation and end the ship's destructive cycle. It's actually a believable story beset with surprises.

There are more tales about ghosts, ghouls, and monsters on ships and under the water than we can ever dream of.  For that reason, ""Ghost Ship"" was tested hard to give any originality to it's story.  ""Ghost Ship"" does manage to dig up a little originality, but in the end, it's just another ghost flick where one bad apple spoils the whole tree.It is a very slick film to watch.  The opening sequence is morbidly fun to watch.  The acting was hit and miss.  I don't buy Julianna Marguiles as a tough seadog, but she suffices in her role as heroine.  Gabriel Byrne does pretty good considering the stock character he plays.  Isaiah Washington took a weightless character and gave it a little depth.  I actually pulled for his character...a little.  Ron Eldard was okay, and the rest of the cast did a pretty convincing job. The ship was one of the best characters in the whole film.  It's look and feel gave the movie the dark tone it needed to stay above water.The special effects were fun.  Nothing came across too fake.  The ghosts were believable, especially the creepy songstress who Isaiah Washington's character ""falls"" in love with.  Overall, not much to complain about in the FX department.The storyline is a little punchy.  There are a couple of things that don't quite add up in the movie.  The ending left me wanting more.  It looks as if a sequel might have been hinted at, but if such a sequel should come along, it will be nothing but more of the same.I didn't go into much detail about the plot, because if you've seen any of the other Dark Castle productions(""The House on Haunted Hill,"" ""Thirteen Ghosts""), you've pretty much seen them all.  Much like the other films, there is a little bit of nudity, a lot of curse words, and pretty good-looking theatrical gore.  In the end, ""Ghost Ship"" isn't that scary, but it is a fun film to look over once or twice just for the atmosphere set up by the ship and the little girl who is trying to help our hapless crew.

Instead of moving too fast too early so you can outguess the plot, the opening scene shows an intriguing series of events that leaves your interest piqued about what lies ahead and holds your attention.Falling away from the standarad locales of haunted houses, cemetaries, etc. of other horror movies, it is nice to see a fresh perspective on an unsettling and unseemingly evil ship.  Somewhat straightforward in the cast getting killed one by one (no surprise there) with twists and turns thrown in, the viewer is thrown for a loop later in the movie that is totally unexpected and adds a nice angle to the whole story. The suspense in the movie is well done and there are good special effects to boot.  Lastly, the ending has a nice reedeming quality too in that it is not what is expected and gives you a good jolt.

That explains why the strength of Beck's first two films as a director, ""Thir13en Ghosts"" and ""Ghost Ship"" have been triumphs of set design.  Unfortunately, with this 2002 horror film once again the set design overwhelms the story and characters.Julianna Margulies, who stars in ""Ghost Ships"" as Epps, has described the film as ""The Shining"" meets ""Dead Calm,"" and it is certainly impossible not to watch this film and find echoes of previous horror films that you have seen since we are talking about a haunted house movie set on an ocean liner (which reminds me of ""Alien"" more than anything else).  What else is there to inject new blood into this horror genre besides new locations for recycled stories?Actually Mark Hanlon and John Pogue do try to come up with something different.  The opening sequence of the film is one of the grossest you have ever seen and I can guarantee you that it terms of the mystery it presents the audience you will never see the solution coming.  Unfortunately, that solution ends up being rather over the top (when you come up with something too far fetched for a horror film you know that you are going to have problems).  More importantly, ... which is the more unforgivable sin in this genre.Forty years after the blood bath of the opening sequence the titular vessel is discovered by a salvage crew in the Bering Sea.  This is a very odd place for a trans-Atlantic Italian ocean liner to end up, but this does not bother Murphy (Gabriel Byrne) or his crew, who are too consumed by the dollar signs dancing in their heads to worry about things like the fact that the rusted ship keeps doing the now you see it, now you don't routine on their radar.  Once aboard Epps, the character who has the virtue of having more brains and guts than the rest of the crew combined, encounters the ghost of little girl Katie (Emily Browning), who keeps suggesting the visitors want to get off the ship right now.  Of course, if they did that there would be no film and all this great set design work would be for naught.""Ghost Ship"" is another in a long series of disappointing big budget horror films that have been foisted off on us in the past several years.  Apparently the lesson of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" which had no special effects to speak of but still managed to be scary for a whole lot of people, is lost on Hollywood.

601814,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00005JLK0,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[6, 8]","This movie starts almost like an episode of &#65533;Love Boat&#65533;.  The music is light and nearly romantic as you zoom into the Antonia Graza cruising the high seas with well-dressed crew and passengers.  However, no sooner do you zoom onto the ship with dancing passengers than a really bad thing happens, and there is blood and horrible death.We fast forward 40 years and meet a salvage ship crewed by a variety of nearly stereotypical characters.  After a brief introduction showing how dedicated the crew members are, the salvage ship heads out to sea.  During a storm the salvage ship runs into, literally, the Antonia Graza.  Naturally the crew members see a huge salvage opportunity and the money to be made from that opportunity.  Thus the plot of the movie is reasonably simple:  return the Graza to running condition and take her to port to be able to make a fortune.  Of course, a variety of eerie events occur that let you know that the Graza is not just a derelict ship waiting to be salvaged.As the movie progresses, the wonderfully spooky atmosphere enhances what would otherwise be a run-of-the-mill ghost story.  There are portions of the movie that are terribly predictable, always an annoyance in any movie, but fortunately there are nearly as many unpredictable scenes that overcome the predictable ones.  Perhaps the most interesting part of the movie is the last 15 or 20 minutes, when the fate of the ship and crew 40 years earlier is revealed in great and gory detail.  Furthermore, I was not expecting what happened at the very end of the movie.This movie is not likely to win any awards.  However, the sets, the cinematography and portions of the plot made this movie worthy of a bowl of popcorn and a future re-watch.  There are probably no points in the movie where I jumped or my heart leapt, but I was intrigued by the periodic hints of what happened to the ship 40 years earlier, and during the time from 40 years ago to today.

Things quickly go downhill from there as it piles on cliche after cliche and disappoints with a cheesy and predictable ending.""Ghost Ship"" recycles all the usual haunted house material, but because it's about a haunted ocean liner, it very nearly redeems itself. Yes, doors open by themselves to reveal hanging corpses. Yes, there's a glimpse of a character who shouldn't be there. Yes, there's a cigarette burning in an ashtray that hasn't been used in 40 years. And yes, there's a struggle between greed and prudence as the dangers pile up. These are all usual elements in haunted house movies, but here they take place aboard the deserted--or seemingly deserted--hulk of the Antonia Graza, an Italian luxury liner that disappeared without a trace during a 1962 cruise to America and has now been discovered 40 years later, floating in the Bering Strait.A salvage crew led by Gabriel Byrne and Julianna Margulies sets out to capture this trophy, which could be worth a fortune. They are told about the ship by Ferriman (Desmond Harrington), a weather spotter for the Royal Canadian Air Force. He managed to capture some photos of it, and tips them off inreturn for a finder's fee. On board the salvage tug are Murphy the skipper (Byrne), Epps the co-owner (Margulies), and crew members Greer (Isaiah Washington), Dodge (Ron Eldard), Munder (Karl Urban) and Santos (Alex Dimitriades). Under the time-honored code of horror movies, they will disappear in horrible ways in inverse proportion to their billing--although of course there's also the possibility they'll turn up again.The most absorbing passages in the film involve their exploration of the deserted liner. The quality of the art direction and photography actually evoke some of the same creepy, haunting majesty of those documentaries about descents to the grave of the Titanic. There's more scariness because we know how the original passengers and crew members died (that opening scene has a grisly humor), and because the ship still seems haunted--not only by that sad-eyed little girl, but perhapsby others.The film piles on the gore, but doesn't go for many shocks or scares. It takes almost an hour for the first crew member to die, but admittedly, tension slowly does build, leading up to that grisly moment. Style and atmosphere are definitely a plus here and for the most part, the film works well. Unfortunately, the creepiness and tension of the first hour is lost in what is a horrific final twenty minutes. The cheesy final scene is the icing on the cake, ruining an otherwise superior horror film.Is it worth seeing? Depends. It breaks no new ground as horror movies go, but it does introduce an intriguing location, and it's well made technically. The promising start gave me such hope. Too bad it didn't reach its full potential.

It's done by the same producers who did House On Haunted Hill (seen), and Thirteen Ghosts (next up to see!) I enjoyed House On Haunted Hill, and I ended up enjoying this!It starts off very much like a cheap and tacky soap opera, judging by the severely dodgy music and even dodgier curly and PINK font on the credits! I was quite shocked at this, as this isn't your stereotypical way to display all the lovely people who were involved in a movie. And definitely not in PINK!Starting off in 1962, we're soon transported forward in time to the present day, a tried and tested trick in films these days. We're introduced to Gabriel Byrne, the appropriately named ""Murphy"" - even though it makes me think of Jack Nicholson's character in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.Full of scary ghosts, and a bratty little girl, who keeps appearing alive and scaring Julianna Margulies shipless. Either I didn't get it, or it never really explains why all the other characters on the ship are dead, and she appears seemingly alive, although she is a ghost. I probably didn't get it, knowing me.A lot of scenes featuring the ghost ship and other certain parts seem stolen from another great film about a ship - Titanic of course. One particular scene at the end, where Julianna Margulies is lying on a piece of wreckage, is very similar to Kate Winslet lying on a piece of wreckage! The whole storyline made little bells start ringing, as it's the story of the Marie Celeste (the ship which disappeared and then reappeared, with no crew or passengers on it), just extended. Murphy even mentions the Marie Celeste during the movie.The finale is just simply unsatisfying. It's left almost hanging, and it ruined the whole movie for me, and it seems that there may or may not be a sequel - it seems as if the underlying storyline could keep recurring.

BELOW got all the critical raves, but GHOST SHIP is by far a more entertaining, frightening and coherent film.Director Steve Beck gives us one of the most fantastically staged opening scenes in recent horror cinema.  With flawless editing and mind-boggling special effects, this scene is worth the cost.  I don't know why this movie has received such negative feedback.  It has atmosphere, a likeable cast, and some great effects, editing and music.  Gabriel Byrne is a little wooden as the captain, but this helps balance out the ensemble acting; Julianna Margulies joins the list of Sigourney doppelgangers, and does it well; Ron Eldard as Dodge is great in his role as the salvage man secretly in love with Margulies; Isaiah Washington (who was so brilliant in TRUE CRIME) is very good as the soon to be wedded Greer; Karl Urban shines in his role as the ""comic relief""; Desmond Harrington as the boyishly charming Jack Ferriman fits his role well; and Emily Browning as the little girl is wonderful (she was also good in last year's DARKNESS FALLING).  Another memorable scene, which conjures up images of Brian dePalma's early works, is magnificent as Sarah shows us what happened on the boat.I loved this movie and consider it one of the best in the genre in some time!If you haven't seen it, give it a chance.

The salvage crew is then haunted by the ghosts of the ship's victims.

The story revolves around an evil spirit who tricks a group of people into boarding a ghost ship in which he is collecting souls to send to Hell. Great plot, huh? He has to reach the number of souls required, so I killing everyone originally on board the ship (who are the ghosts now) wasn't enough, so he brings new people on for those ghosts, and himself, to kill. Yay!This isn't really a scary movie. It's gory as all hell, so if you have a weak stomach, do avoid.

At 91 minutes, the film is too short and not scary enough, while some of the scenes contained herein border on tasteless gore.PLOT: In a nutshell, a salvage group in present day gets duped into going after an ocean liner that disappeared in 1960.  No, the ship didn't sink.  It just became repopulated by ghosts.Transfer wise, this is a very nice looking DVD.  Colors during the opening sequence (supposed to be taking place in 1960 on the last night anyone was seen aboard the ship) are bold, colorful and brilliantly balanced.  When we fast forward to present day and the ship is seen in its various stages of decay, the muted color scheme is equally well balanced with rich browns, deep blacks and incredibly fine detail evident in the background information, even under the lowest of lighting conditions.  Edge enhancement, aliasing and shimmering are virtually non-existant on this DVD.  This is a stunning visual experience.  The audio is equally impressive, mixed to 5.1 and sounding of incredibly vivid, rich basses, perfectly pitched trebles and a lot of power during the action sequences.Extras: A ship full - beginning with several in-depth documentaries on the making of the movie, a comprehensive behind the scenes look, interviews with the stars, deleted scenes, a really fun &quot;mysteries of&quot; featurette and the film's theatrical trailer.  Plus bonus features for your DVD-ROM.  WOW!BOTTOM LINE:  So much more could have been done with the plot that I really can't recommend the movie on its own merit.  You won't be scared.

The scene the way it is arranged and ""made"" is a well-worthy opening for a horror-movie, and impressive done and thought-out. But from here it's not going anywhere near this scary again.

60s.There is a grand ball being held on deck when someone flips a switch and a guy wire tears into everyone's bodies,killing them all.The only survivor is a young girl.Fast forward to present day and a crack crew of salvagers get a tip from an airman who has spotted a large ship adrift in the Bering Strait.They investigate its last known location and find it;in fact they literally bump into it.They go aboard and start a sweep of the interior.Part way along one crewman goes through the floor and is pulled back up by another,who briefly sees a little girl standing on the floor below.Shrugging it off they all continue to investigate.Along the way they discover a hug cache of gold and decide to forget salvaging the ship.When they try to leave,their salvage ship blows up,killing a crewman.From here on,things get desperate for the crew.They decide to float the ship to the nearest port but spirits within the ship start showing themselves.The young girl seen briefly earlier now makes herself known to one of the crew.The captain of the salvage team enters the cabin of the ships captain,and he appears to him.He shows him a bit of the back story to what lead to the crews deaths.It seems they picked up one survivor from a sinking liner,along with the gold.The survivor looks alot like the airman who put them onto this ships location and is aboard with them now.The little girl further enlightens them as to what happened,as the man they picked up encouraged the original crew to mutiny so they could claim the gold for themselves.It is this entity that has kept the crew and passengers souls there since the incident that killed them and he is after this salvage crew now.One by one the salvage crew falls by the way side until there is only one survivor,who has to confront the evil entity.We learned that this thing works for Satan and uses the ship to collect souls for his masters.The last survivor,after a struggle,manages to sink the ship and free the souls from bondage.Adrift in the ocean the survivor is eventually rescued.Sitting in an ambulance near the dock side,she spots some of her old friends loading boxes(presumably the gold boxes)onto the ship,followed by the self same entity she thought went down with the ship.I thought the ending was a bit of a question mark,not making alot of sense,but other than that the story,on the whole,was pretty credible.All do a fine job in the acting department and it was well directed and edited.After having lots of exposure from Xena:Warrior Princess as Caesar,Keith Urban did this movie just after Xena ended,and just before he co-starred in the epic trilogy Lord of the Rings.Urban is now a rising star in such films as Judge Dredd and Star Trek.It is good to see Keith is doing so well.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras abound here,and they include:three featurettes,a ships tour,a music vid,a the trailer and enhanced features for your PC.In conclusion Ghost Ship is a perfect movie to get the popcorn out for,if you're looking for a good scare.It is not perfect but it generally satisfies over all.3 1/2-4 stars.",4,A decent

601858,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JLK0,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","Ghost Ship (Steve Beck, 2002)My first time through this movie, Saturday night, I fell asleep about fifteen minutes before the end. (In my defense, it was two-thirty in the morning.) At that point, I was wondering why on earth this movie has gotten such uniformly horrible reviews. I immediately put it on hold at the library so I could catch the final fifteen minutes and review it.I got a chance to watch the final fifteen minutes last night. Someone please reassure me that such a high-powered cast had had the climax of the movie kept from them, because I can't imagine them actually getting involved with a project whose payoff is so phenomenally awful.The basics: A pilot named Jack Ferriman (Desmond Harrington of Wrong Turn) hires a salvage crew after spotting an abandoned ship drifting in the Bering Strait. The salvage crew, who are (this is Hollywood, after all) the best in the business, are intrigued, and decide to go see if there's anything on the ship worth rescuing. When they find it, Murphy (Gabriel Byrne), their leader, recognizes it as the Andrea Graza, an Italian luxury liner that went missing forty years ago, vanishing without a trace until, presumably, it showed up in one of Ferriman's photographs. The team head onto the ship, where, of course, nothing is as it seems.It has been noted that the original script for Ghost Ship actually was for a straightforward adventure picture about a salvage crew who go somewhat stir-crazy and turn on one another, with no supernatural elements involved. That shows promise. And in fact, most of the first three-quarters of the movie (with the exception of the first scene, which is the movie's best) runs just along those lines. It's deceiving you, you see, into thinking that's what it actually is. The crew start fighting amongst themselves over little stuff, the kind of thing you'd expect when a bunch of people have been in one another's company for way too long. And in that regard, the movie works; had it just been an above-the-arctic-circle-in-an-abandoned-luxury-liner version of Das Boot, it had every chance of working. But then you get to the inevitable ""no, I'm really a horror movie!"" climax, and everything goes way downhill way fast. I find it hard to imagine anyone actually watched the climax without (a) thinking of The Abyss (though not in the way you're thinking) and (b) laughing hysterically throughout. It's possible they had a few million left in the effects budget and wanted to blow it, but I get the feeling that whoever rewrote the script to add the supernatural elements had been waiting a long, long time to see his particular vision on the big screen. Well, he got it. And I can't tell you how badly it sucks without revealing huge plot points, so watch this turkey and see for yourself. After all, it's a ninety-minute film, and the first seventy-five are actually pretty good. **Oh, and I have to ask-- did anyone else wonder how so many crew members managed to survive for even a few minutes in the Bering Sea without contracting hypothermia?

Remember when the lawyer split in Thirteen Ghosts?  Within 5 minutes of Ghost ship a cable on a luxury cruise ship snaps and slices an entire deck full of people in half.  Awesome special effects here!The main premise of the movie follows a salvage crew hired by a man who claims to have found a large derelict vessel, offering them a large percentage to help him haul it in.  They find the ship, and more than they bargained for.  There is millions of dollars of gold on the Antonia Graza, but also a bevy of guests who have never left.Epps, played by Julia Margulies, believes that she has seen a young girl aboard the derelict ship who tries to warn her away.  But before anyone will listen to her, greed and accidents take over and the crew becomes trapped aboard the Antonia Graza and, of course, people start dying.Truly a visual stunner, don't miss the flashback scene perfectly choreographed to an almost sexy melody using slow motion and step-speed filming to perfection, and when the movie is finished, check out the video 'Not Falling' by Mudvayne.

Too bad there isnt a special DVD release containing ONLY that sequence because the rest of this flick is extremely forgettable.&quot;Ghost ship&quot; has a great setting (..alarmingly haunted and abandoned ship) and it could have been overall great had that premise been used adequately in better hands: notably, a scriptwriter and a director. But instead it sinks before it ever leaves the harbor.The attempted story goes very summarily like this: an abandoned cruiser re-appears about 40 years and a crew of salvagers set off to retrieve the gold rumoured to be on it only to discover that the ship holds a deadly and haunting secret within it.Like i said above, this all sounds well and good if not very promising but only on paper. Because, what goes on on the screen is a grand cinematic failure.Aside of the opening scene where the entirety of the passengers are slashed into oblivion with one big swift cut, &quot;Ghost ship&quot; is ridden with bad acting, cheap thrills and even cheaper scares which might scare a teenager at best, and a story so full of holes it would make swiss cheese look terribly compact.The biggest mystery in this film is why an actor of the caliber of Gabriel Byrne agreed to play in this disaster.Buy the film poster but avoid the film at all costs.",1,Highly unrecommendable &quot;coullda been&quot;...,1069718400,"11 25, 2003",2003,1426,"['now', 'anyone', 'even', 'passing', 'interest', 'thrillers-horror', 'films', 'he/she', 'HAS', 'see', 'opening', 'sequence', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'ship', 'quot', 'Too', 'bad', 'there', 'special', 'DVD', 'release', 'containing', 'ONLY', 'sequence', 'rest', 'flick', 'extremely', 'forgettable.', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'ship', 'quot', 'great', 'setting', '..alarmingly', 'haunted', 'abandoned', 'ship', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'overall', 'great', 'had', 'premise', 'been', 'used', 'adequately', 'better', 'hands', 'notably', 'scriptwriter', 'director', 'instead', 'ever', 'harbor.The', 'attempted', 'story', 'very', 'summarily', 'abandoned', 'cruiser', 're-appears', '40', 'years', 'crew', 'salvagers', 'set', 'off', 'retrieve', 'gold', 'rumoured', 'be', 'only', 'discover', 'ship', 'deadly', 'haunting', 'secret', 'it.Like', 'i', 'said', 'well', 'good', 'not', 'very', 'promising', 'only', 'paper', 'what', 'screen', 'grand', 'cinematic', 'failure.Aside', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'entirety', 'passengers', 'are', 'slashed', 'oblivion', 'one', 'big', 'swift', 'cut', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'ship', 'quot', 'ridden', 'bad', 'acting', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'even', 'cheaper', 'scares', 'might', 'scare', 'teenager', 'best', 'story', 'so', 'full', 'holes', 'would', 'make', 'swiss', 'cheese', 'look', 'terribly', 'compact.The', 'biggest', 'mystery', 'film', 'why', 'actor', 'caliber', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'agreed', 'play', 'disaster.Buy', 'film', 'poster', 'avoid', 'film', 'costs']",N/A

The commercials, and some reviews make it sound like it's an evil haunted ship. Well, that's the half of it. Who's controlling what happens on the ship? Is it the ship itself, or the hanuted people on board, or maybe the devil?Basically, a ship that was lost some 40+ years before is found abandoned and (somehow) still floating in the bearing straight. As soon as they get on the ship wierd things start happening. What's frustrating here is the lack of characters ability to notice that something isn't quite right. Even when they notice wierd things, they keep it to themselves for the most part, which isn't very realistic.The movie wasn't what I thought it'd be about, which I think just about everybody who sees it will agree. It was more like a sea-dwelling ""Event Horizon"" then anything. ...). If you liked ghost ship, you may like Event Horizon, but yet I digress.So, in the very end of the movie everything makes sense. I won't give it away, cause although I thought the movie wasn't so great, and that it dragged on, I really got a kick out of the very last 10-15 seconds of the movie. It's funny how one image can make it all make sense. Now, if they could have only made the rest of the movie that interesting.There really isn't a lot of horror in this movie. The beginning 5 minutes is the grossest part, and from then on, it's pretty much PG-13 if I remember correctly, other than some [breasts].Now, for those who have actually seen this, this section of my review will make more sense then for those who haven't. I'm not sure the point of the beginning scene. I mean, if you wanted to kill a bunch of people all at once, and you actually had a bunch of guys with machine guns, wouldn't you just line them up and mow them down, what's the deal with the dramatic ""death trap"" device? Seems kind of far-fetched to me. Seems like an awful lot of trouble. Not that I'm an expert in killing mass amounts of people all at once. :)So anyways, if it wasn't for that last 10-15 seconds, which are brilliant, I'd rate this a 2 star cause the movie is long, doesn't have a lot of action or horror, and doesn't really get to the point until the very last seconds.I don't think they set this up for a sequal like some have speculated, but rather the final seconds explain really how everything works.So, a good renter, but I would have been upset had I paid to see this in a theater.",3,"Not bad, but it's not really about the ship",1050278400,"04 14, 2003",2003,2531,"['enough', 'reviews', 'here', 'talk', 'story', 'lot', 'detail', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'there', 'thing', 'not', 'really', 'ship', 'commercials', 'reviews', 'make', 'evil', 'haunted', 'ship', 'Well', 'half', 'Who', 'controlling', 'what', 'ship', 'ship', 'hanuted', 'people', 'board', 'maybe', 'devil', 'Basically', 'ship', 'was', 'lost', '40+', 'years', 'before', 'found', 'abandoned', 'somehow', 'still', 'floating', 'bearing', 'straight', 'As', 'soon', 'get', 'ship', 'wierd', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'What', 'frustrating', 'here', 'lack', 'characters', 'ability', 'notice', 'something', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right', 'Even', 'when', 'notice', 'wierd', 'things', 'keep', 'most', 'part', ""n't"", 'very', 'realistic.The', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'think', 'just', 'everybody', 'who', 'will', 'agree', 'was', 'more', 'sea-dwelling', 'Event', 'Horizon', 'then', 'anything', 'liked', 'ghost', 'ship', 'may', 'like', 'Event', 'Horizon', 'yet', 'digress.So', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'everything', 'sense', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'cause', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'great', 'dragged', 'really', 'got', 'kick', 'very', 'last', '10-15', 'seconds', 'movie', 'funny', 'how', 'one', 'image', 'can', 'make', 'make', 'sense', 'Now', 'could', 'have', 'only', 'made', 'rest', 'movie', 'interesting.There', 'really', ""n't"", 'lot', 'horror', 'movie', 'beginning', '5', 'minutes', 'grossest', 'part', 'then', 'pretty', 'much', 'PG-13', 'remember', 'correctly', 'other', '[', 'breasts', ']', '.Now', 'who', 'have', 'actually', 'seen', 'section', 'review', 'will', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'then', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'point', 'beginning', 'scene', 'mean', 'wanted', 'kill', 'bunch', 'people', 'once', 'actually', 'had', 'bunch', 'guys', 'machine', 'guns', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'line', 'up', 'mow', 'down', 'what', 'deal', 'dramatic', 'death', 'trap', 'device', 'Seems', 'kind', 'far-fetched', 'awful', 'lot', 'trouble', 'Not', ""'m"", 'expert', 'killing', 'mass', 'amounts', 'people', 'once', 'So', 'anyways', 'was', ""n't"", 'last', '10-15', 'seconds', 'are', 'brilliant', ""'d"", 'rate', '2', 'star', 'cause', 'movie', 'long', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'action', 'horror', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'point', 'very', 'last', 'seconds.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'set', 'up', 'sequal', 'have', 'speculated', 'rather', 'final', 'seconds', 'explain', 'really', 'how', 'everything', 'works.So', 'good', 'renter', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'upset', 'had', 'paid', 'see', 'theater']",N/A

Thought lost at sea for more than 40 years, once onboard the eerie cavernous ship, the crew discover that the decaying vessel is anything but deserted.  It's home to something more deadly and horrific than anything they've encountered in all their years at sea.ReviewThere is something knowing in this films charm.  Yes its decidedly corny, but as it opens with 1940&#65533;s period credits, one can&#65533;t help but think its always giving you a sly nudge and wink throughout.  Unlike other horror films, this doesn&#65533;t rely on over the top MTV editing but rather classic jumps and scares, building a solid if what somewhat flawed 90 minutes of entertainment.Opening with one the most original mass killings that I can recall, it is hilariously disgusting throughout.  And while, the story slows briefly to introduce everyone, it picks up apace and has beautifully depicted montage to Mudvayne&#65533;s latest song. Captain Sean Murphy (Byrne) is a slat weathered old hand, and lends the story some weight while team leader Maureen Epps (Margulies) and First Mate Greer (Washington) engage with the basic script aplomb.Hidden within this film, is a twist that will have you kicking yourself, and while the haunted house concept of Ghost Ship has yet to produce a classic, its filled with moments that bring it close.  The premise may be unoriginal but Ghost Ship is still worth a look, if only for a chance to laugh at an ending that is as knowing as it is ridiculous.The VerdictGhost Ship provides a fun night out; its not necessarily going to scare you ridged, but how many films really do that in our desensitised days?  It is gruesome, making me laugh on plenty of occasions, and with the talent on display here you have to conclude that they knew what they were creating.

Because it's amazingly predictable and by the numbers horror. All the usual suspects are gathered and dispatched with an alarming paucity of imagination.The plot is pretty simple: In 1963 a luxury ship disappears at sea without a trace. Nearly 40 years later, a salvage crew discovers the boat still on the ocean being carried by the currents. Although there's no one alive on board, there's every sign that someone has been there recently. That's when the scary stuff starts to happen.There's a stellar acting crew aboard the ship. Everyone from Gabriel Bryne to Julianna Margulies gives routine performances. Despite the pedigree of the cast, they are clearly uninspired by the weak material.It's amazing and rather sad that this type of material is produced today. Sadly, the horror films that have come out over the last couple of years (with a few exceptions)demonstrate a real lack of understanding about what makes films both effective and scary. Creating a shock a minute and gruesome make up and visual effects doesn't make a compelling horror film by themselves. It takes a literate, intelligent script with engaging characters. Ghost Ship has neither.Director Steve Beck has demonstrated that he has the skills to do by the numbers films. He's a talented director rudderless in a sea of mediocre material. Without any inspired material, Beck's films just don't work. This is the type of Z movie material that might have made for a good laugh on a Creature Features television series but today it's pretty inexcusible.

Emily Brown appears as a little girl (remember, it's from 2002). Julianna Margulies looks fine but they don't do enough with her. Let's just say ""Ghost Voyage"" is better in the area of women (see my review for details).Still, the ship sets are excellent (it seems like they shot the film in a realship), the score is refreshing, the movie has a nice haunting atmosphere and there are some goodthrills, particularly one of the greatest horror scenes in the history of cinema in the prologue, no kidding.
