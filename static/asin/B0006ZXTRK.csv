A man many of us can relate to.  Yes.  He tried to kill himself in 2010 by Stabbing himself in the stomach 9 times.  He survived thank god and all his fans hope his career continues and he betters himself.His comedy is along the lines of Kinison, Pryor, Leary and Carlin if they all got in a wicked bar fight, after a night of drunken' debauchery, and threw up all there jokes onto the floor and fell asleep in them.  Artie is pure brilliance and his command of a room is like no other.Quite a few of our friends had never heard of Artie Lange and almost peed themselves laughing so hard at this dvd.  He's that funny.  Yes.  Buy It, Watch it but before you do, be sure to pee.",5,H  .  I  .  L  .  A  .  R  .  I  .  O  .  U  .

Artie Lange was one of the funniest and most down-to-earth comedians around, and it shows well in this DVD. The only problem with any show by a great comedian, is that it's over too soon.

Mckinley,"[11, 18]","I like Artie on the Howard Stern Show, but his standup is basically yelling ""Fire!"" and making other references to his jokes on the Stern show when his normal routine doesn't get any major laughs. I was a little dissapointed, because I honestly think Artie is so much better when he's calmer, i.e., not drunk, and not pandering to a drunken crowd that equates humor with simply yelling profanities. I was not offended by the profanity, I just think swearing with no real joke attached is just lazy and pointless.",3,Fire!!!!!,1118188800,"06 8, 2005",2005,512,"['like', 'Artie', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'Show', 'standup', 'basically', 'yelling', 'Fire', 'making', 'other', 'references', 'jokes', 'Stern', 'show', 'when', 'normal', 'routine', ""n't"", 'get', 'major', 'laughs', 'was', 'little', 'dissapointed', 'honestly', 'think', 'Artie', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'when', 'calmer', 'i.e.', 'not', 'drunk', 'not', 'pandering', 'drunken', 'crowd', 'humor', 'simply', 'yelling', 'profanities', 'was', 'not', 'offended', 'profanity', 'just', 'think', 'swearing', 'real', 'joke', 'attached', 'just', 'lazy', 'pointless']",Artie Lange - It's the Whiskey Talking

876206,A29Y3KEGVVG1VC,B0006ZXTRK,Reviewer X,"[3, 4]","I have been a fan of Artie Lange's since he was on MadTV.  His appearences on the Conan O'Brien show were hysterical. So, when he took over the ""Jackie Chair"" on the Howard Stern Show I was thrilled.  Of course with his success on the show it was obvious to all the regular listeners that Artie was going market something eventually.  When word of the DVD first came out on the air I knew I would buy it, but I didn't hold out hopes that this would be a great stand-up act.  I was wrong.Artie's stand up was not only funny enough to make you laugh until you cried, but it was extremely original.  The vast majortity of the act was funny, well-paced and at times even a little insightful.  When it failed it is not for lack of trying, but some of the material isn't worked out very well.  A classic bit is Artie's observations on Harry Carry.Is it the best stand-up ever, no.  Is it great, yes.  Is it worth the money?

876208,A3CW4EZUTEV0VC,B0006ZXTRK,The Rocketman,"[39, 44]","If John Belushi's character in Animal House had become a comedian, he would have been Artie Lange.Artie Lange had been on both television (MAD TV) and in movies (most notably DIRTY WORK) before joining the Howard Stern show as Jackie the Jokeman's official replacement.  It was Stern's show that has given him the most exposure.The concert on this DVD was shot in April 2004 in Tempe, AZ and contains many inside references that Stern fans will recognize (including imitations of Jeff the Drunk and Artie's trademark AC/DC scream ""FIRE!"").  The show is fair and balanced and will equally offend both extremes on the political left and right.  And while some of Artie's schtick here has already been on the Stern show, there are some great moments including his discussion of a street basketball game and his analysis of a classic Warner Bros. cartoon character.  What's amazing is how many people in Arizona are tuned into Artie's distinct brand of New Jersey humor, right down to detailed descriptions of New York sports teams.The DVD also contains 2 special features:a)  GAMEDAY, a short 17 minute film, made in 2000 and written by Artie.  Artie's ease in front of the camera is apparent and really the only reason to watch this short.  I think Artie included this on the DVD for sentimental reasons, it's the weak portion of the disc.b)  BACKSTAGE PASS, a 24 minute documentary following Artie to two of his concerts in New Jersey.  The first show was in May 2004, the second show is June 2004 and was a benefit for the Rev. Bob Levy to raise money for his divorce expenses.  Watching Artie here is like watching a train wreck:  from shoveling down truckloads of processed meat to washing it down with his trademark Jack and water, the man is clearly in a lot of pain.  And yet, the film is strangely compelling as you see that, despite years of living in Los Angeles and having become a national celebrity to Stern fans, Artie is the same guy who used to work the piers in New Jersey.If you enjoy Artie on the Howard Stern show, you will enjoy this DVD.  Maybe this will be more like the Artie we hear when Stern moves his show to ""eh, eh, eh.""",4,Artie Lange - without the dump button,1108080000,"02 11, 2005",2005,2148,"['John', 'Belushi', 'character', 'Animal', 'House', 'had', 'become', 'comedian', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Artie', 'Lange.Artie', 'Lange', 'had', 'been', 'television', 'MAD', 'TV', 'movies', 'most', 'notably', 'DIRTY', 'WORK', 'joining', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'show', 'Jackie', 'Jokeman', 'official', 'replacement', 'was', 'Stern', 'show', 'given', 'most', 'exposure.The', 'concert', 'DVD', 'was', 'shot', 'April', '2004', 'Tempe', 'AZ', 'many', 'inside', 'references', 'Stern', 'fans', 'will', 'recognize', 'including', 'imitations', 'Jeff', 'Drunk', 'Artie', 'trademark', 'AC/DC', 'scream', 'FIRE', 'show', 'fair', 'balanced', 'will', 'equally', 'offend', 'extremes', 'political', 'left', 'right', 'Artie', 'schtick', 'here', 'already', 'been', 'Stern', 'show', 'are', 'great', 'moments', 'including', 'discussion', 'street', 'basketball', 'game', 'analysis', 'classic', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'cartoon', 'character', 'What', 'amazing', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'Arizona', 'are', 'tuned', 'Artie', 'distinct', 'brand', 'New', 'Jersey', 'humor', 'right', 'down', 'detailed', 'descriptions', 'New', 'York', 'sports', 'teams.The', 'DVD', 'also', '2', 'special', 'features', 'GAMEDAY', 'short', '17', 'minute', 'film', 'made', '2000', 'written', 'Artie', 'Artie', 'ease', 'front', 'camera', 'apparent', 'really', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'short', 'think', 'Artie', 'included', 'DVD', 'sentimental', 'reasons', 'weak', 'portion', 'disc.b', 'BACKSTAGE', 'PASS', '24', 'minute', 'documentary', 'following', 'Artie', 'two', 'concerts', 'New', 'Jersey', 'first', 'show', 'was', 'May', '2004', 'second', 'show', 'June', '2004', 'was', 'benefit', 'Rev', 'Bob', 'Levy', 'raise', 'money', 'divorce', 'expenses', 'Watching', 'Artie', 'here', 'watching', 'train', 'wreck', 'shoveling', 'down', 'truckloads', 'processed', 'meat', 'washing', 'down', 'trademark', 'Jack', 'water', 'man', 'clearly', 'lot', 'pain', 'yet', 'film', 'strangely', 'compelling', 'see', 'years', 'living', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'having', 'become', 'national', 'celebrity', 'Stern', 'fans', 'Artie', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'used', 'work', 'piers', 'New', 'Jersey.If', 'enjoy', 'Artie', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'show', 'will', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'Maybe', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'Artie', 'hear', 'when', 'Stern', 'show', 'eh', 'eh', 'eh']",Artie Lange - It's the Whiskey Talking

I love Artie on Howard, he makes so many funny comments and observations, but thats when he is only chiming in once in a while. On this DVD, he is in the spotlight, and has no one else (like Howard and the gang) to fall back on. I was expecting a HILARIOUS stand-up routine from Artie, on par with Chris Rock, and what I got was a DVD that didn't make me laugh out loud once. Sure, I smiled several times, was amused several times, but no real laughs. Ironically, after watching this DVD I watched Larry The Cable Guy's DVD (which I thought would be HORRIBLE) and laughed about 40 times. I expected a lot more from Artie. The DVD isn't BAD, its just not very funny. At all. And that's coming from a big fan of the Stern show. At under $10 though, it can't hurt to try it and see if you agree with me.",2,"Artie is funny on Howard, BUT.....",1133222400,"11 29, 2005",2005,860,"['when', 'carry', 'own', 'show', 'pretty', 'flat', 'love', 'Artie', 'Howard', 'so', 'many', 'funny', 'comments', 'observations', 'thats', 'when', 'only', 'chiming', 'once', 'while', 'DVD', 'spotlight', 'one', 'else', 'Howard', 'gang', 'fall', 'back', 'was', 'expecting', 'HILARIOUS', 'stand-up', 'routine', 'Artie', 'par', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'out', 'loud', 'once', 'Sure', 'smiled', 'several', 'times', 'was', 'amused', 'several', 'times', 'real', 'laughs', 'Ironically', 'watching', 'DVD', 'watched', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'DVD', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'HORRIBLE', 'laughed', '40', 'times', 'expected', 'lot', 'more', 'Artie', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'BAD', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'coming', 'big', 'fan', 'Stern', 'show', '10', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'try', 'see', 'agree']",Artie Lange - It's the Whiskey Talking
