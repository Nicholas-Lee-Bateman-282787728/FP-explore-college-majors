Scenes drawn out too long (problems with pacing). Irritating shaking of the camera, jumping about to create a disorienting effect in scenes where it had no purpose. (Seriously, Blair Witch has alot to answer for.)Protagonists make all the cliche'd mistakes to the point that you want to slap them. Supernatural entity done nicely and some good acting (along with the rather bad acting). Seen worse, but it came across as too ametureish to allow you to properly immerse yourself in the story.",2,College project gone bad,1338076800,"05 27, 2012",2012,596,"['cover', 'art', 'was', 'clearly', 'most', 'expensive', 'thing', 'film', 'low', 'budget', 'college', 'project', 'Scenes', 'drawn', 'out', 'too', 'long', 'problems', 'pacing', 'Irritating', 'shaking', 'camera', 'jumping', 'create', 'disorienting', 'effect', 'scenes', 'where', 'had', 'purpose', 'Seriously', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'alot', 'answer', 'Protagonists', 'make', 'cliche', ""'d"", 'mistakes', 'point', 'want', 'slap', 'Supernatural', 'entity', 'done', 'nicely', 'good', 'acting', 'rather', 'bad', 'acting', 'Seen', 'worse', 'came', 'too', 'ametureish', 'allow', 'properly', 'immerse', 'story']",N/A

A son has died by apparent suicide, leaving behind clues that are either proof of his mental disintegration, or something far more sinister and dangerous. His mum sets out to find the truth, only to be caught up in her son's nightmare world. This movie makes the best of its microscopic budget, utilizing great performances, a unique story, and macabre settings to bring it to life. The scenes of decaying buildings, an ancient cemetery, and church facades are especially effective.

1332531,A3MGJVPJBNPSEJ,B0038MUZ3Y,Blahblahblah,"[16, 17]","During the first few minutes of the film I thought to myself ""this is going to be crap"" -- it looked like it was going to be incompetent cheese like Argento's rather unfortunate ""Mother of Tears"" -- but I was pleasantly surprised.  As the plot began to clarify itself, it wound up becoming an effective piece that was very moody and suspenseful.  This is definitely a film for those who prefer a horror movie with a growing sense of dread over special effects and bodycounts.  Enhancing the film's effectiveness, although it was obviously low budget, some (not all) of the performers, particularly the lead, were actually quite good.  I was particularly impressed by the direction.  It was filled with lots of creative shots and movement which helped maintain a tense mood throughout.  Whenever the director got creative it worked, instead of coming off as self-conscious garbage like Crank.  It reminded me of directors from the 70s who cared what the film looked like, like Jean Rollin before he began making crappy direct to video digital films, or for a more recent example, The Collector (which is a beautifully shot film whatever its faults).  The locations and sets also really enhanced the mood. The one critique I have of the film (and it is a major one) is that I found the demon, as well as all of the people writhing around it, ridiculous (which is why the opening left me pessimistic).  The less clearly you saw the demon (and his followers at the height of their orgies around the demon, or the raven girl), the better they worked.  They should have been kept to glimpses.  But maybe the director felt a bit of a need to cater to the limited tastes of those horror fans who require spectacle.",4,Moody,1304121600,"04 30, 2011",2011,1706,"['first', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'thought', 'myself', 'going', 'be', 'crap', 'looked', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'incompetent', 'cheese', 'Argento', 'rather', 'unfortunate', 'Mother', 'Tears', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'plot', 'began', 'clarify', 'wound', 'up', 'becoming', 'effective', 'piece', 'was', 'very', 'moody', 'suspenseful', 'definitely', 'film', 'who', 'prefer', 'horror', 'movie', 'growing', 'sense', 'dread', 'special', 'effects', 'bodycounts', 'Enhancing', 'film', 'effectiveness', 'was', 'obviously', 'low', 'budget', 'not', 'performers', 'particularly', 'lead', 'were', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'direction', 'was', 'filled', 'lots', 'creative', 'shots', 'movement', 'helped', 'maintain', 'tense', 'mood', 'Whenever', 'director', 'got', 'creative', 'worked', 'instead', 'coming', 'off', 'self-conscious', 'garbage', 'Crank', 'reminded', 'directors', '70s', 'who', 'cared', 'what', 'film', 'looked', 'Jean', 'Rollin', 'began', 'making', 'crappy', 'direct', 'video', 'digital', 'films', 'more', 'recent', 'example', 'Collector', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'film', 'faults', 'locations', 'sets', 'also', 'really', 'enhanced', 'mood', 'one', 'critique', 'have', 'film', 'major', 'one', 'found', 'demon', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'writhing', 'ridiculous', 'why', 'opening', 'left', 'pessimistic', 'less', 'clearly', 'saw', 'demon', 'followers', 'height', 'orgies', 'demon', 'raven', 'girl', 'better', 'worked', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'kept', 'glimpses', 'maybe', 'director', 'felt', 'bit', 'need', 'cater', 'limited', 'tastes', 'horror', 'fans', 'who', 'require', 'spectacle']",N/A

1332534,A27T25M3GEM24,B0038MUZ3Y,phreejax,"[23, 30]","I really liked this movie -- per the director, John Michael Elfer, ""Finale"" is something of an homage to movies like Dario Argento's 1977 ""Suspiria,"" but there's a lot more going on here than just that.  There are (and I think this is quite deliberate) elements here of a great many fine movies, not just the horror / giallo hybrids that Argento became famous for, but also Mario Bavo's gothic masterpieces, Clive Barker's better movies, and even Robert Wise's superb and still-scary 1963 film, ""The Haunting.""I liked ""Finale"" so much that I did a little research, and found this very revealing comment by the director, John Elfer:""My oldest brother hanged himself when I was 12, and my mother retreated into grief-stricken denial and paranoia, blaming his death on the planned sacrifice of a demonic cult. I wrote FINALE to face my demons, telling the story from her perspective.My team landed grants from Kodak and Panavision, then set out for the post-industrial wasteland on the outskirts of my hometown, shooting in backwoods, abandoned houses, down dirt roads, crypt-like passages and cemeteries - desolate, haunting, forgotten places.We ran through flames, blasted a prosthetic head with shotguns, got held up at gunpoint by police who mistook us for burglars, the FBI found our prop pipe-bombs and shut down the highway to blow them up.We lived on location and worked without heat or running water in the dead of winter. I stunt-doubled for actors, even dressed in drag with my legs shaved.I gave up all stability, even lived out of my car to see FINALE to completion. I took a leap of faith to chase my dreams - a trial by fire - and we passed.""Elfer's movie more than just 'passes.'  It also LOOKS GREAT, actually more striking, visually, than most big budget horror films.  Lots of indie films are shot in budget-friendly Super 16 format, but Elfer seems to have a special understanding of how to get a really stunning result using this film.  And that includes great in-camera and mechanical visual effects, done so well they should please even the most jaded CGI fan.My only complaint about the movie is that when the plot speeds up in the second half, the story becomes a bit muddled; personally, I think a little more exposition, and a little less of those great visual effects I mentioned, would have resulted in a more satisfying second-half and ending.Finally, I have to mention the two main actors:  Carolyn von Hauck and Suthi Picotte.  Both are lovely women and each brings life to their character in a way their male counterparts just, well, don't.  I hope they both have a great career in the future; they deserve it.",4,A true gothic gem despite the budget,1305072000,"05 11, 2011",2011,2640,"['really', 'liked', 'movie', 'director', 'John', 'Michael', 'Elfer', 'Finale', 'something', 'homage', 'movies', 'Dario', 'Argento', '1977', 'Suspiria', 'lot', 'more', 'going', 'here', 'just', 'are', 'think', 'quite', 'deliberate', 'elements', 'here', 'great', 'many', 'fine', 'movies', 'not', 'just', 'horror', '/', 'giallo', 'hybrids', 'Argento', 'became', 'famous', 'also', 'Mario', 'Bavo', 'gothic', 'masterpieces', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'better', 'movies', 'even', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'superb', 'still-scary', '1963', 'film', 'Haunting', 'liked', 'Finale', 'so', 'much', 'did', 'little', 'research', 'found', 'very', 'revealing', 'comment', 'director', 'John', 'Elfer', 'oldest', 'brother', 'hanged', 'when', 'was', '12', 'mother', 'retreated', 'grief-stricken', 'denial', 'paranoia', 'blaming', 'death', 'planned', 'sacrifice', 'demonic', 'cult', 'wrote', 'FINALE', 'face', 'demons', 'telling', 'story', 'perspective.My', 'team', 'landed', 'grants', 'Kodak', 'Panavision', 'then', 'set', 'out', 'post-industrial', 'wasteland', 'outskirts', 'hometown', 'shooting', 'backwoods', 'abandoned', 'houses', 'down', 'dirt', 'roads', 'crypt-like', 'passages', 'cemeteries', 'desolate', 'haunting', 'forgotten', 'places.We', 'ran', 'flames', 'blasted', 'prosthetic', 'head', 'shotguns', 'got', 'held', 'up', 'gunpoint', 'police', 'who', 'mistook', 'burglars', 'FBI', 'found', 'prop', 'pipe-bombs', 'shut', 'down', 'highway', 'blow', 'up.We', 'lived', 'location', 'worked', 'heat', 'running', 'water', 'dead', 'winter', 'stunt-doubled', 'actors', 'even', 'dressed', 'drag', 'legs', 'shaved.I', 'gave', 'up', 'stability', 'even', 'lived', 'car', 'see', 'FINALE', 'completion', 'took', 'leap', 'faith', 'chase', 'dreams', 'trial', 'fire', 'passed', 'Elfer', 'movie', 'more', 'just', ""'passes"", 'also', 'LOOKS', 'GREAT', 'actually', 'more', 'striking', 'visually', 'most', 'big', 'budget', 'horror', 'films', 'Lots', 'indie', 'films', 'are', 'shot', 'budget-friendly', 'Super', '16', 'format', 'Elfer', 'have', 'special', 'understanding', 'how', 'get', 'really', 'stunning', 'result', 'using', 'film', 'great', 'in-camera', 'mechanical', 'visual', 'effects', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'should', 'please', 'even', 'most', 'jaded', 'CGI', 'fan.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'movie', 'when', 'plot', 'up', 'second', 'half', 'story', 'bit', 'muddled', 'personally', 'think', 'little', 'more', 'exposition', 'little', 'less', 'great', 'visual', 'effects', 'mentioned', 'would', 'have', 'resulted', 'more', 'satisfying', 'second-half', 'ending.Finally', 'have', 'mention', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'Carolyn', 'von', 'Hauck', 'Suthi', 'Picotte', 'are', 'lovely', 'women', 'life', 'character', 'way', 'male', 'counterparts', 'just', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'hope', 'have', 'great', 'career', 'future', 'deserve']",N/A

I fell in love with the photography, with so much beige tones, big grain, and that ""big head"" screen filling where the entre frame is taken up by tight close ups of someone talking, that I felt like it could have been a Paragon release from 1982.  Kudos are in order for making a film with so many old cars, phones with cords, and early 80s decor that when the scene with the son and the cll phone came up at the end I felt it was a deus ex machina until I realized, hey, it just adds to the phantasmagorical aspects of it all.  The plot concerns one mother who finds a demonic plot in her son's suicide, which at the onset of the film may be a descent into her insanity, and winds up with her fighting tooth and nail against  a devil cult led by someone who may be another mother- or Maeter of B. (something I kept from writing out fully to avoid ruining the plot, just keep an eye out for the feather boa to see who I mean), as it were, as this films quickly veers into what could be construed as another option of the Third Mother of ""Suspiria De Profundis"".  I am going to take heat for this one, but I felt like this film would have made for a more satisfying conclusion to the Mothers' trilogy than the film Argento eventually made as it has more of a rabbit hole approach to it, and has a dream-like aspect to it- so much so that it reminded me in parts of ""Inland Empire."" And hey, when was the last time you saw a DTV horror flick that didn't have gratuitous rock music during the end credits.  Overall, I think I will be watching this one again- it would make a great 80s throwback double bill with ""House of the Devil.""
