He'd had his own television shows for about three years before he made the mistake of marrying Debbie Reynolds.  It was not a marriage, but a publicity stunt which went bad.  She had to try to outshine him in his movie debut, but couldn't quite manage it.  I loved her in 'Tammy and the Batchelor' but then she was pretending to be a young, backward Southern girl in love with an older man who was pledged to someone else, a sophisticated pure-bred.The baby was a delightful little actor.  He looked just like Buddy Hackett.  The Christmas theme set it off with beautiful Technicolor, and Eddie's 'mumbling' in the interview scene was reminiscent of someone I know.  Being the son of the store owner, he could have any girl he wanted, but he again made a mistake by choosing one he thought was 'experience' since she already had a child.The music was spectacular.

417680,A2GZVA22WYG95I,6304383193,J. Olsen,"[9, 10]","Polly Parrish (Debbie Reynolds) works at the Merlin Department store. She gets fired for over-aggressive sales (too many of her sales are returned the next day). So on her last day on the job she is out on her lunch break looking for another situation. That is when she witnesses a baby being left on the steps of an orphanage. Afraid it will fall off, she goes to the rescue and is discovered ""leaving her baby""--so they think. After she has answered a few questions from the orphanage staff she realizes what they are thinking and scurries out. But they had learned her name and where she works. They track her down and discover from her employer that she had been fired that day. They deduce that she was concerned that she would no longer be able to care for her baby and that is why she ""abandon"" him. They convince young Mr. Merlin (the boss's son, played by Eddie Fisher) to give her back her job, and in the process he becomes involved with the ""family,"" and his father, John B. Merlin, Sr., becomes convinced that he is a grandfather. Things get pretty crazy as Polly believes that Mr. Merlin, Sr. is going to have her baby taken from her.Though fun in its own way, this lacks the chemistry and wit of the original with David Niven and Ginger Rogers (in spite of the fact that Fisher and Reynolds were husband and wife, and parents of Carrie Fisher). Imdb trivia indicates that this was Fisher's acting debut and that he didn't care for this movie.Unlike the original, this is a musical. Though the leads are both excellent musical talents, I prefer this story without the tunes. Even though much of the dialogue is the same from one movie to the other, it just doesn't seem to have the same spark in this version. Maybe it is just because I have enjoyed the original for so long, nothing can come close to it.If you like the lead players and you like musicals, you will probably like this movie--it does have its own charm and I do own it, but if I could only have one, I would take the original.

Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher are great as the mis-matched couple who  end up holding the baby, literally!  A musical remake of the 1930s film  &quot;Batchelor Mother&quot; this little film has a great musical score and  a nice little plot that is easy to follow.  When Reynolds an out of work  salesgirl finds an abandoned baby everyone thinks it is hers, and this is  the start of a comedy of errors that will have you laughing and crying in  the same breath.  Enter Eddie Fisher, Debbie's employer who thinking she  has abandoned her child because she has just lost her job, gives her back  her job along with the BABY and the laughs really start in earnest!  With  an adorable little boy to look after, Debbie has to juggle her life and her  job, whilst trying to convince everyone that she is not the boy's mother.  Add another complication in the form of Fisher's father played  magnificently by Adolphe Menjou who thinks he is a grandfather and sets  about claiming his grandchild, and you have a funny, gentle comedy that  gives you many a chuckle for the duration of the film.  So all you folks  that just want a nice little film to watch with no violence, no bad  language, and no nude scenes, then this film is for you.
