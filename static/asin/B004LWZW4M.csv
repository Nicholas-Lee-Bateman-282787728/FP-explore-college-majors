''Rise of the planet of the Apes'' truly deserves to be in ''Planet of the apes'' saga. The movie started off as nothing special. The plot was not too original and certainly simple. Then through out half of the movie (before the point of no return happens with Cesar), we see us, humans, from our sadistic, barbarian side. You will see animal cruelty often. But then the expected happens and movie becomes truly magnificent as Cesar rises. I'm very much against animal abuse, and to those people who think they shouldn't watch because of it, you should! There is no overdose, and everything as if was taken from our every day lives. Besides of the virus that was designed by humans that turned apes into smart beings, everything else is very believable. Don't just take my word for it, buy the movie and enjoy it! I truly want a second part of the movie! And hope there are more like me. A great movie. Go and buy it right now! You won't regret your choice even if you are new to the ''Planet of the apes'' saga!

1415446,A1R8LZYZR3377O,B004LWZW4M,ajsteele,"[1, 1]","Yes, ""Damn dirty humans!"" And that's what they were. For an ape film, that's not a bad thing as you might know. The original POTA inferred that us dirty humans brought all this hell upon ourselves. This version continues in that same vain by emphasizing how bad we can still be. The actors were a bit one dimensional and flat at times but movie makers sometimes dumb down the banter to reach a profitable audience. All be it, that problem wasn't enough to rip away at the driving intrigue of the film. OF COURSE though, the apes are the stars, as they were in the original and succeeding films. Heston from the 1968 classic, being a star of such talent and magnitude, is an exception to the ""apes only"" star rule. The original POTA stands alone, I don't think it can ever be replicated. As a huge ape fan since ""68, I could see this was a decent way of retelling the apes saga. Because really, that's what this film is, another first in a series that could get very deep with the ponderousness of religion, science, etc.. After the Wahlberg disaster, it's good to see some creative & intelligent minds at work trying to put an acceptable newness to POTA.The film is more a blend of ""Escape"" and ""Conquest"" (""Conquest"" being the superior) than a remake of the ""68 stunner. I know some got hung up with medication being the catalyst that advances apes, but it makes sense for a couple of reasons. The evolution model is more fun to play around with, that's true, but with that idea, your possibly doing another Burton bomb remake.I think because most fans were digusted with the Wahlberg mess, the makers didn't want to go down that road again. To counter, rather than duplicate apes evolving over ages, Csears awareness and self growth became it's own mini-evolution overture. POTA 2011 slowly reveals itself to be a pure revenge film. Csears creepiness played well off the wicked zoo keeper. A smart ape staring you down has a viseral punch. Well captured scenes of brooding terror among the apes made me harken back to an old school style of film making. The verbal references to the original were mildly distractive but I realize though there is such an affinity and desire for connectivity to the core, that I took it in stride.CG can either make or break a movie. In this case, for the projection of real apes, it works. Otherwise, it's unlikely I'd get to see a gorilla jump on to a helicopter and the like. POTA 2011 sets the stage for what I can only think will be some mind boggling sci-fi, which is what made the original so powerful.The real physical bodies of raging apes marauding through streets, bashing windows and crawling along rooftops is grounded in enough purpose for the Planet Of The Apes of this generation to succeed. I will always enjoy the original films (except ""Battle"")on a different level. Time and cinema march on. As long as POTA is still alive, we get to indulge in other variations of it's concept, and this interesting film is one of them.",4,Damn dirty humans,1326672000,"01 16, 2012",2012,2974,"['Yes', 'Damn', 'dirty', 'humans', 'what', 'were', 'ape', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'might', 'know', 'original', 'POTA', 'inferred', 'dirty', 'humans', 'brought', 'hell', 'version', 'same', 'vain', 'emphasizing', 'how', 'bad', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'actors', 'were', 'bit', 'one', 'dimensional', 'flat', 'times', 'movie', 'makers', 'sometimes', 'dumb', 'down', 'banter', 'reach', 'profitable', 'audience', 'be', 'problem', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'rip', 'away', 'driving', 'intrigue', 'film', 'COURSE', 'apes', 'are', 'stars', 'were', 'original', 'succeeding', 'films', 'Heston', '1968', 'classic', 'being', 'star', 'such', 'talent', 'magnitude', 'exception', 'only', 'star', 'rule', 'original', 'POTA', 'alone', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'ever', 'be', 'replicated', 'huge', 'ape', 'fan', '68', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'decent', 'way', 'retelling', 'apes', 'saga', 'really', 'what', 'film', 'first', 'series', 'could', 'get', 'very', 'deep', 'ponderousness', 'religion', 'science', 'etc..', 'Wahlberg', 'disaster', 'good', 'see', 'creative', 'intelligent', 'minds', 'work', 'trying', 'put', 'acceptable', 'newness', 'POTA.The', 'film', 'more', 'blend', 'Escape', 'Conquest', 'Conquest', 'being', 'superior', 'remake', '68', 'stunner', 'know', 'got', 'hung', 'up', 'medication', 'being', 'catalyst', 'apes', 'sense', 'couple', 'reasons', 'evolution', 'model', 'more', 'fun', 'play', 'around', 'true', 'idea', 'possibly', 'doing', 'Burton', 'bomb', 'remake.I', 'think', 'most', 'fans', 'were', 'digusted', 'Wahlberg', 'mess', 'makers', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'down', 'road', 'again', 'counter', 'rather', 'duplicate', 'apes', 'evolving', 'ages', 'Csears', 'awareness', 'self', 'growth', 'became', 'own', 'mini-evolution', 'overture', 'POTA', '2011', 'slowly', 'reveals', 'be', 'pure', 'revenge', 'film', 'Csears', 'creepiness', 'played', 'well', 'wicked', 'zoo', 'keeper', 'smart', 'ape', 'staring', 'down', 'viseral', 'punch', 'Well', 'captured', 'scenes', 'brooding', 'terror', 'apes', 'made', 'harken', 'back', 'old', 'school', 'style', 'film', 'making', 'verbal', 'references', 'original', 'were', 'mildly', 'distractive', 'realize', 'such', 'affinity', 'desire', 'connectivity', 'core', 'took', 'stride.CG', 'can', 'either', 'make', 'break', 'movie', 'case', 'projection', 'real', 'apes', 'Otherwise', 'unlikely', ""'d"", 'get', 'see', 'gorilla', 'jump', 'helicopter', 'like', 'POTA', '2011', 'stage', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'mind', 'boggling', 'sci-fi', 'what', 'made', 'original', 'powerful.The', 'real', 'physical', 'bodies', 'raging', 'apes', 'marauding', 'streets', 'bashing', 'windows', 'crawling', 'along', 'rooftops', 'grounded', 'enough', 'purpose', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'generation', 'succeed', 'will', 'always', 'enjoy', 'original', 'films', 'Battle', 'different', 'level', 'Time', 'cinema', 'march', 'As', 'long', 'POTA', 'still', 'alive', 'get', 'indulge', 'other', 'variations', 'concept', 'interesting', 'film', 'one']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

When this happens, I give more credit to the director, the actors, the music, and camera work, than the actual story. Well, this just so happens to be one of those movies and, though it didn't necessarily do anything that hasn't been done by movies before, the production quality stands out, and assures that this will be remembered as one of the best films of 2011.The story is tragic, exciting, and inspiring. Much of the movie felt like a drama, it is filled to the rim with emotion and moments that will move you. The way that ceaser (Starring chimp) interacts, his expressions as he identifies another evil of man or another obstacle to overcome, you will route for that chimp as you watch his story unfold. It isn't a bad way to spend a couple of hours. The ending is as satisfying as the climax of the story, the whole movie is built around both, as it should be. I was left with no unanswered questions as the credits rolled.As I mentioned before, the real jewel of this movie is the production quality. No expense was sparred in the detail of the computer-digitized scenes. They are frequent and in your face. You'll be amazed at ceaser and all of the ape's detail as they climb, wing, and communicate with each other. These are some of the best computer generated images on a screen anywhere.I've been looking forward to this movie, and I can say with confidence, it was worth the wait. I can't find any real issue to fault the movie on. The only character that seemingly lacked purpose was will's(James Franco/ lead character) girlfriend, though there were two scenes where I guess she did help out.The Bottom line is this; If you haven't seen this movie, you really should.

Skeptically I ventured to see the unbelievably hyped summer movie named Rise of the Planet of the Apes and to my astonishment, treated to a great story replete with stunning actions and storyline.The story as it is told is supposedly a prequel to the original planets as to how the apes came to escape and rule the world once populated by humans but set in present day.A young scientist takes home a ape named Caesar after his mother dies and the lab at which he works at decides to kill all the apes that they are testing on in order to find a cure for Alzheimer's. They form a close bond, but tragedy strikes and Caesar and Franco are forced to part ways. While in captivity, Caesar starts rebelling and comes to despise the ways of the human ( there are actually many events leading to this) eventually culminating in a action packed finale atop the Golden Bridge in San Fransisco, when the apes manage a relentless assault against the humans.Incredible and exciting are words which spring to my mind, this film delivers on action, entertainment and emotion. James Franco is like able as the doctor. But it is Caesar the ape, emoted by Andy Serkis that is the heart of the film.

1415469,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004LWZW4M,Andrew Ellington,"[10, 12]","With spectacular special effects, inspired set designs, sharply cut action sequences and a rather surprising performance given by a CGI monkey, `Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is shockingly well executed.  I, for one, was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this film, especially since that 2001 debacle directed by Tim Burton was enough to scar me for life.The basic premise is that, in an attempt to find a cure for Alzheimer's, a group of scientists create a smarter, craftier, deadlier breed of apes.  This, obviously, was not intentional, and the deadlier aspect was a developed quality thanks to human beings inability to perform acts of kindness that are not steeped in selfish pursuits (unless you are James Franco).  When the project goes awry, the apes are all euthanized, all except a newborn monkey named Caesar.  Caesar grows into a genius monkey, but he is still a monkey and humans just don't understand monkeys enough to except them as equals and so they are rash in their decisions and thus, Caesar is eventually mistreated and hardened and soon, as can be expected, the apes begin to `rise'.This is obviously a prequel to the famed films starring a young Charlton Heston.  Thankfully, while the film ends just as the uprising is set to begin, `Rise of the Planet of the Apes' never feels like it isn't telling the whole story.  Sure, it is only the beginning and yet it does feel complete.My issue with this film lies solely in the scripting.  Sadly, the dialog and human situations are just plain stupid, unbelievable and careless.  Franco's character and his job situation makes little sense, and the caricature treatment of `evil men with power' is insulting and unrewarding, and rather disappointing when you consider the advanced technical aspect of the film and the fact that this really could have, and should have, been a deeper and more tightly orchestrated project.This could have been amazing.I'm sort of over James Franco too.  Remember back in the early-mid 2000's when his name meant `walk away from the theater'?  Then 2008 hit and all of a sudden we were all blindsided by this string of performances (`Milk', `Pineapple Express', `127 Hours') that we never saw coming and his name became linked with an `it boy' status that the world wanted to investigate.  Yeah, that time has passed and his name now denotes an eye roll from myself and many that I know.  He's back to bad acting again.  But Andy Serkis is rather brilliant here in his deep portrayal of Caesar.  The way he inserts so many notable emotions into this monkey, and the way that he gradually develops his every changing persona is very impressive.So, I recommend this.  Not many will expect this to be smart, and so what you get will be more than you bargained for, since as an action film this really excels.  The opening and closing sequences alone are some of the best action scenes I've seen in a long time, and the way that the sequences are editing (sharp, close but never chaotic to the point of obscured) is just genius!I just really wish the script itself were up to par with the film's vast technical marvels.",3,Monkey mayhem at its finest; sort of...,1329004800,"02 12, 2012",2012,3126,"['spectacular', 'special', 'effects', 'inspired', 'set', 'designs', 'sharply', 'cut', 'action', 'sequences', 'rather', 'surprising', 'performance', 'given', 'CGI', 'monkey', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'shockingly', 'well', 'executed', 'one', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'especially', '2001', 'debacle', 'directed', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'was', 'enough', 'scar', 'life.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'attempt', 'find', 'cure', 'Alzheimer', 'group', 'scientists', 'create', 'smarter', 'craftier', 'deadlier', 'breed', 'apes', 'obviously', 'was', 'not', 'intentional', 'deadlier', 'aspect', 'was', 'developed', 'quality', 'thanks', 'human', 'beings', 'inability', 'perform', 'acts', 'kindness', 'are', 'not', 'steeped', 'selfish', 'pursuits', 'are', 'James', 'Franco', 'When', 'project', 'awry', 'apes', 'are', 'euthanized', 'newborn', 'monkey', 'named', 'Caesar', 'Caesar', 'genius', 'monkey', 'still', 'monkey', 'humans', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'monkeys', 'enough', 'except', 'equals', 'so', 'are', 'rash', 'decisions', 'thus', 'Caesar', 'eventually', 'mistreated', 'hardened', 'soon', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'apes', 'begin', ""rise'.This"", 'obviously', 'prequel', 'famed', 'films', 'starring', 'young', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Thankfully', 'film', 'just', 'uprising', 'set', 'begin', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'never', 'feels', ""n't"", 'telling', 'whole', 'story', 'Sure', 'only', 'beginning', 'yet', 'feel', 'complete.My', 'issue', 'film', 'solely', 'scripting', 'Sadly', 'dialog', 'human', 'situations', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'unbelievable', 'careless', 'Franco', 'character', 'job', 'situation', 'little', 'sense', 'caricature', 'treatment', 'evil', 'men', 'power', 'insulting', 'unrewarding', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'when', 'consider', 'advanced', 'technical', 'aspect', 'film', 'fact', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'deeper', 'more', 'tightly', 'orchestrated', 'project.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'amazing.I', ""'m"", 'sort', 'James', 'Franco', 'too', 'Remember', 'back', 'early-mid', '2000', 'when', 'name', 'meant', 'walk', 'away', 'theater', 'Then', '2008', 'hit', 'sudden', 'were', 'blindsided', 'string', 'performances', 'Milk', 'Pineapple', 'Express', '127', 'Hours', 'never', 'saw', 'coming', 'name', 'became', 'linked', 'boy', 'status', 'world', 'wanted', 'investigate', 'Yeah', 'time', 'passed', 'name', 'now', 'eye', 'roll', 'many', 'know', 'back', 'bad', 'acting', 'again', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'rather', 'brilliant', 'here', 'deep', 'portrayal', 'Caesar', 'way', 'so', 'many', 'notable', 'emotions', 'monkey', 'way', 'gradually', 'changing', 'persona', 'very', 'impressive.So', 'recommend', 'Not', 'many', 'will', 'expect', 'be', 'smart', 'so', 'what', 'get', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'bargained', 'action', 'film', 'really', 'opening', 'closing', 'sequences', 'alone', 'are', 'best', 'action', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'way', 'sequences', 'are', 'editing', 'sharp', 'close', 'never', 'chaotic', 'point', 'obscured', 'just', 'genius', 'just', 'really', 'wish', 'script', 'were', 'up', 'par', 'film', 'vast', 'technical', 'marvels']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

1415472,A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P,B004LWZW4M,Arch Stanton,"[3, 5]","First off I love the originalPlanet of the Apes. It's a great and thought-provoking film from the '70s with a good story and a great finale. Then came the sequels. The first one was all right. It had a dumb ending and some truly dull bits but on the whole it was ok. The second one had a few interesting ideas but the central premise was so dumb that it could never recover. It went downhill from there. The series had hit a dead end. They had effectively written themselves out of places to go with sequels so they went to prequels. Eventually their narratives got stale they tried torebootthe franchise with immensely disappointing results. This film serves as a prequel to the original movie. It shows how earth got taken over by apes in the first place. This isn't a particularly faithful sequel since many things have changed since the '70s but there are several references to the original film. Mot of these are pretty good but a few are overly obvious and cheesy.Unlike the original Planet of the Apes this film is focused on characters. While the climactic action scene is pretty epic and feels deserved the majority of the movie is Caesar learning first to relate to his fellow (but stupid) apes and then organizing them into a resistance. Throughout this time you really get a feel for who Caesar is as a person. I can't think of any film quite like it. They've given Caesar a real emotional core without taking away his animal nature. The other apes manage to have personalities too. The gorilla is big and angry but my favorite has to be the orangutan that has such an expressive face and can speak sign language too. The human characters are rather more boring. None of the actors do a bad job but their story just isn't as interesting as Caesar's. We've seen all of them before but we've never seen anyone like Caesar.The plot of the movie is pretty basic. A young scientist (James Franco) desperately searches for a cure to Alzheimer's so that he can cure his ailing father (John Lithgow). As part of the animal tests for this virus Caesar is born. When the project goes haywire Franco adopts baby Caesar and raises him in his own home. Through a series of events which I will not describe Caesar becomes the leader of an ape revolution as they try to escape from mankind.This movie should have been a failure. I rolled my eyes when I heard they were making this. But somehow it manages to succeed against all odds. The greatest part of this movie is unquestionably the apes (actually chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans). These creations come to life and are the core of the film. The CGI is fantastic. While you can generally tell which apes are fake (hint: all of them!) there are moments where they cease to be computer generated images and become breathing creatures. Essentially photo-real. These are the best CGI creations since Gollum. That character was created by the same crew that made these ones. A major factor in creating these animals is the actors. All of the apes are played on set by a different actor. Caesar is played by Andy Serkis who also did Gollum and King Kong and is an expert at these roles. He filmed his scenes with the actors on set and was digitally replaced afterward. This provides a real physical presence to the apes instead of just making them a mass of pixels.",5,How Did Yet Another Planet of the Apes Sequal End Up So Good?,1312588800,"08 6, 2011",2011,3316,"['First', 'off', 'love', 'originalPlanet', 'Apes', 'great', 'thought-provoking', 'film', ""'70s"", 'good', 'story', 'great', 'finale', 'Then', 'came', 'sequels', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'right', 'had', 'dumb', 'ending', 'truly', 'dull', 'bits', 'whole', 'was', 'ok', 'second', 'one', 'had', 'few', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'central', 'premise', 'was', 'so', 'dumb', 'could', 'never', 'recover', 'went', 'downhill', 'there', 'series', 'had', 'hit', 'dead', 'end', 'had', 'effectively', 'written', 'places', 'go', 'sequels', 'went', 'prequels', 'Eventually', 'narratives', 'got', 'stale', 'tried', 'torebootthe', 'franchise', 'immensely', 'disappointing', 'results', 'film', 'prequel', 'original', 'movie', 'how', 'earth', 'got', 'taken', 'over', 'apes', 'first', 'place', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'faithful', 'sequel', 'many', 'things', 'have', 'changed', ""'70s"", 'are', 'several', 'references', 'original', 'film', 'Mot', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'few', 'are', 'overly', 'obvious', 'cheesy.Unlike', 'original', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'film', 'focused', 'characters', 'climactic', 'action', 'scene', 'pretty', 'epic', 'feels', 'deserved', 'majority', 'movie', 'Caesar', 'learning', 'first', 'relate', 'fellow', 'stupid', 'apes', 'then', 'organizing', 'resistance', 'time', 'really', 'get', 'feel', 'who', 'Caesar', 'person', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'quite', ""'ve"", 'given', 'Caesar', 'real', 'emotional', 'core', 'taking', 'away', 'animal', 'nature', 'other', 'apes', 'manage', 'have', 'personalities', 'too', 'gorilla', 'big', 'angry', 'favorite', 'be', 'orangutan', 'expressive', 'face', 'can', 'speak', 'sign', 'language', 'too', 'human', 'characters', 'are', 'rather', 'more', 'boring', 'None', 'actors', 'do', 'bad', 'job', 'story', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'interesting', 'Caesar', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anyone', 'Caesar.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'pretty', 'basic', 'young', 'scientist', 'James', 'Franco', 'desperately', 'cure', 'Alzheimer', 'so', 'can', 'cure', 'ailing', 'father', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'part', 'animal', 'tests', 'virus', 'Caesar', 'born', 'When', 'project', 'haywire', 'Franco', 'adopts', 'baby', 'Caesar', 'own', 'home', 'series', 'events', 'will', 'not', 'describe', 'Caesar', 'leader', 'ape', 'revolution', 'try', 'escape', 'mankind.This', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'failure', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'when', 'heard', 'were', 'making', 'somehow', 'succeed', 'odds', 'greatest', 'part', 'movie', 'unquestionably', 'apes', 'actually', 'gorillas', 'orangutans', 'creations', 'come', 'life', 'are', 'core', 'film', 'CGI', 'fantastic', 'can', 'generally', 'tell', 'apes', 'are', 'fake', 'hint', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'cease', 'be', 'computer', 'generated', 'images', 'become', 'breathing', 'creatures', 'Essentially', 'photo-real', 'are', 'best', 'CGI', 'creations', 'Gollum', 'character', 'was', 'created', 'same', 'crew', 'made', 'ones', 'major', 'factor', 'creating', 'animals', 'actors', 'apes', 'are', 'played', 'set', 'different', 'actor', 'Caesar', 'played', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'Gollum', 'King', 'Kong', 'expert', 'roles', 'filmed', 'scenes', 'actors', 'set', 'was', 'digitally', 'replaced', 'afterward', 'real', 'physical', 'presence', 'apes', 'instead', 'just', 'making', 'mass', 'pixels']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

1415475,A3LPA9D5IOQ1XY,B004LWZW4M,Ashley Billings,"[2, 3]","I, along with many other people were pretty excited when I kept seeing the previews for this movie.  I wasn't sure what to expect and didn't think I'd like it once I found out it was an original story just carrying the title of Planet of The Apes.  I figures some cash cow was trying to make a 2nd rate movie milking off the name Planet of The Apes.  But I decided to give it a chance and I'm glad I did, I've completely changed my tone towards this movie and can't wait for the sequel.Plot:***SPOILER ALERT****The plot is slightly based, although not directly copied from ""The Conquest of the Apes"" from 1972.  It centers around scientist Will Rodman (played by James Franco) who has discovered a virus that when given to chimpanzees it begins repairing their brain and making them more intelligent, in particular a female ape that can solve a child's puzzle very quickly.  Rodman plans to use this virus to cure Alzheimer's disease, which his father has.  But at the investor's meeting, the female ape goes crazy and goes on a rampage because she fears they are trying to harm her newborn baby.  The project is then shut down and all the chimps are ordered to be put down.  One of the scientists doesn't have the heart to put down the baby and gives him to Will Rodman, who decides to take him home for a few days.Will Rodman decides to keep the baby chimp because he notices the intelligence has been passed from mother to child, and decides to name him Caesar.  Rodman steals some of the virus and gives it to his father to help him.  Which it does, and he not only regains perfect brain function he becomes much smarter than before.  Life is good for Rodman, until he finds the effects of the virus diminish and his father returns to his dementia once again.  He gets into a car that isn't his and starts crashing into cars left and right, the angry neighbor comes out and starts to yell at the father and poke at him.  Caesar seeing all this becomes furious and figures a way to get out of the house and attacks the neighbor.  For this he can no longer stay with Rodman and must live in an animal sanctuary.Caesar feels that he was abandoned in this prison where he is mistreated by the one of the staff(Tom Felton).  Meanwhile Rodman tries to find a way to get Caesar back as well as trying to create a new virus that will help his Dad.  He finds a way and they begin testing on apes again.  They find out that it works even better than the last one but one of the scientists accidentally inhales some of the virus.  Thinking its nothing, they continue on as usual, but it turns out that the virus is fatal to humans, and a pandemic is beginning to start.  Meanwhile, Caesar figures out a way to escape his prison and return to his home where he finds some of the new virus in the refrigerator, he brings it back to the other apes and expose them all to the virus.  Making them just as smart as he is.  They then escape and the staff worker tries to stop Caesar and shock him with his taser, Caesar grabs his hand and he shouts, ""Get your paws off me you damned dirty ape"" to which Caesar shouts ""NO!"" (epic part in the movie) The apes escape the facility and begin causing havoc in the town.The apes head for the center where they were being tested on and free the apes, they go to the zoos and free those apes as well.  Then Caesar begins to lead them to the Redwoods, a place he loved to go as a child, to live happily.  Their final confrontation with the humans is on the Golden Gate Bridge.  The swat teams and tons of police are waiting for them to blow them away and a helicopter is flying around to try to shoot them.  But the apes plan a strategy to evade getting shot, some go under the bridge, some climb to the top to be hidden in the fog, the apes end up ambushing the humans and make their way past them to get to the Redwoods.  Once there Rodman runs after him into the Redwoods where at first he is attacked by another ape but is saved by Caesar, Rodman tells him it's time to come home.  To which Caesar says to him, ""Caesar is Home.""This movie was simply amazing, the CGI effects were a nice change to the older movies which always had actors in suits.  I feel they were able to do more with the characters this way that wasn't possible in the past.  Although throughout most of the movie Caesar doesn't say anything, you can always tell what his emotions are and what he's thinking.  You really connect to him and feel sorry for him, he is a very intelligent creature yet he is treated like a pet and later like a meaningless animal, which leads him to despise humans.  You would think the apes were supposed to be the bad guys in this movie but with that epic scene on the Golden Gate Bridge I was rooting for the apes all the way.  All they wanted was to go to the Redwood forest to swing in the trees lol, nothing more.This movie opened the door for several sequels and I can't wait, there were so many things left unanswered in the film, and I wanted to see more of the apes taking over, but sadly that didn't really happen in this film, you can tell this is just creating the basis for a line of sequels down the road.So, I loved this movie, and it isn't like the older ones, so if you were expecting that you will probably be disappointed.

1415481,A2582KMXLK2P06,B004LWZW4M,B. E Jackson,"[2, 3]","Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a really cool movie.  It's about this advanced research team that uses apes to find a cure for Alzheimer's Disease as well as making apes smarter and stronger.One thing that totally feels bizarre is the way the main ape character (hehe, that's a funny was of putting it I know!) gradually gets stronger and smarter the more he's locked up in his cage, and you can literally SEE how he's advancing by starring into his eyes!  A really unique and surreal piece of production trickery there.  The ape is basically turning into a human before our very eyes with every scene!Anyway the one ape is apparently smarter than the rest... or maybe that's not true at all and he was just the one the movie writers chose to pick out and focus on because they felt they needed to make one stand apart from the pack.  Either way, he was wearing a nice orange shirt so it was always easy to locate him (well, until another ape took exception to the shirt assuming he was trying too hard to stand out among the other apes and therefore ripped it off his back- a friendly ""welcome home"" reminder that there's a normal wild ape underneath that shirt perhaps).A good chunk of the storytelling revolves around watching apes swing around through high tree branches and even swing across beams on the living room and attic ceilings (of the one home the ape was temporarily living in) which results in a pretty awesome segment near the beginning with several carefully timed swings throughout the entire house.  This was the home of one of the researchers, where his own father had Alzheimer's Disease.  The researcher wanted to test his skills on his own father to see if a cure would actually occur or not.  At first it works and his father's a drastically different and more upbeat person.  Later... well you know the rest.The only part I strongly DIDN'T like is when the ape became smart enough to actually start talking, though at least the movie writers did the right thing by only keeping his choice of words to basically 3 or 4 things (mainly screaming ""NOOOO!"" with an exception of one crucial line near the end that I won't spoil).It's amazing how well the writing is in other areas such as showing the apes being aggressive and dominant but never intending to kill a human being unless they feel they're blocked in and absolutely have to.Expect lots of apes swinging from trees and branches (and ceiling beams) while watching this film.  Perhaps the writing could have been a little stronger in some regards (for example, while the one monkey was locked in a cage and had to deal with a security guard constantly smacking him with a club or squirting water at him along with several other disrespectful things, the ape never got the kind of revenge he most certainly *should* have gotten by persevering all that torment) but for the most part, it's a quality film.",4,apes gone wild,1347753600,"09 16, 2012",2012,2885,"['Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'really', 'cool', 'movie', 'advanced', 'research', 'team', 'apes', 'find', 'cure', 'Alzheimer', 'Disease', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'apes', 'smarter', 'stronger.One', 'thing', 'totally', 'bizarre', 'way', 'main', 'ape', 'character', 'hehe', 'funny', 'was', 'putting', 'know', 'gradually', 'stronger', 'smarter', 'more', 'locked', 'up', 'cage', 'can', 'literally', 'SEE', 'how', 'advancing', 'starring', 'eyes', 'really', 'unique', 'surreal', 'piece', 'production', 'trickery', 'there', 'ape', 'basically', 'turning', 'human', 'very', 'eyes', 'scene', 'Anyway', 'one', 'ape', 'apparently', 'smarter', 'rest', 'maybe', 'not', 'true', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'movie', 'writers', 'chose', 'pick', 'out', 'focus', 'felt', 'needed', 'make', 'one', 'stand', 'apart', 'pack', 'way', 'was', 'wearing', 'nice', 'orange', 'shirt', 'was', 'always', 'easy', 'locate', 'well', 'ape', 'took', 'exception', 'shirt', 'assuming', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'stand', 'out', 'other', 'apes', 'therefore', 'ripped', 'off', 'back-', 'friendly', 'welcome', 'home', 'reminder', 'normal', 'wild', 'ape', 'underneath', 'perhaps', '.A', 'good', 'chunk', 'storytelling', 'revolves', 'watching', 'apes', 'swing', 'high', 'tree', 'branches', 'even', 'swing', 'beams', 'living', 'room', 'attic', 'ceilings', 'one', 'home', 'ape', 'was', 'temporarily', 'living', 'results', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'segment', 'beginning', 'several', 'carefully', 'timed', 'swings', 'entire', 'house', 'was', 'home', 'one', 'researchers', 'where', 'own', 'father', 'had', 'Alzheimer', 'Disease', 'researcher', 'wanted', 'test', 'skills', 'own', 'father', 'see', 'cure', 'would', 'actually', 'occur', 'not', 'first', 'father', 'drastically', 'different', 'more', 'upbeat', 'person', 'Later', 'well', 'know', 'rest.The', 'only', 'part', 'strongly', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'like', 'when', 'ape', 'became', 'smart', 'enough', 'actually', 'start', 'talking', 'though', 'least', 'movie', 'writers', 'did', 'right', 'thing', 'only', 'keeping', 'choice', 'words', 'basically', '3', '4', 'things', 'mainly', 'screaming', 'NOOOO', 'exception', 'one', 'crucial', 'line', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', '.It', 'amazing', 'how', 'well', 'writing', 'other', 'areas', 'such', 'showing', 'apes', 'being', 'aggressive', 'dominant', 'never', 'intending', 'kill', 'human', 'being', 'feel', ""'re"", 'blocked', 'absolutely', 'have', 'to.Expect', 'lots', 'apes', 'swinging', 'trees', 'branches', 'ceiling', 'beams', 'watching', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'writing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'stronger', 'regards', 'example', 'one', 'monkey', 'was', 'locked', 'cage', 'had', 'deal', 'security', 'guard', 'constantly', 'smacking', 'club', 'squirting', 'water', 'along', 'several', 'other', 'disrespectful', 'things', 'ape', 'never', 'got', 'kind', 'revenge', 'most', 'certainly', '*should*', 'have', 'gotten', 'persevering', 'torment', 'most', 'part', 'quality', 'film']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

The main character is as completely CGI, but done well, or rather not terribly overdone. Add to that a nice spin on the age old story of well intended science running amok with the natural order of things, especially when put in the same equation as greed, and what could be a simple plot line made appealing by modernization for contemporary audiences actually is done well, evading the almost animated appearance of other movies who do so. The story line is pretty predictable, but well executed in all respects. The lines between good and bad, acceptable and unacceptable are drawn almost immediately, laying the cheering lines for an entertaining, pretty fun movie to watch. There's some nice winks to the original ""Planet of the Apes"" that will fly right by contemporary audiences, but proudly picked off by the genre's biggest fans. And they're not gratuitous. They're used with good timing and reason. The flick moves real fast, but by the end, you can see why. There's no way this story could be told in one movie, and the ending reeks of a sequel.

To be brutally honest, I never thought that Director Rupert Wyatt could pull off a serious reboot of the Planet of the Apes movies without it looking abit like Burton's film but, lo and behold, with Andy Serkis' performance as Caesar- he does more than that. He actually makes the story believable. If Serkis or Wyatt one doesn't get an award during the Oscars, then those people in Hollywood are just plain silly.

I wanted to believe, to immerse myself and enjoy the show, but the story was too weak and contrived.None of the characters possessed the power of an individual who has a soul. I drifted away from the picture, thinking about other things. Cesar gained my pity, but not my sympathy, never my admiration. The humans were mere cardboard cut-outs, a backdrop to the apes, and the caretakers of the ape sanctuary in San Bruno were mere goons. I know it is just a movie, but I couldn't swallow that: Bay area activists would have protested and media would have headlined until that place was shut down. Some of the action episodes brought me back, but this was just an action flick, and not a very good action flick at that. The final action sequence was ridiculous, and I was annoyed by the filmmaker's attempt to get the audience cheering for the apes as they face down the police.The production was professional, in that current Hollywood manner, where all of the good guys are attractive and their homes stunningly beautiful. It doesn't innovate, or dare to challenge the current correct thinking (animals are good, humans are bad). The scenes in the ape sanctuary were very dark on my home system, which may have been mood lighting, but made it difficult to see what was happening at times.I barely remember the original Planet of the Apes movies, which played when I was very young. This has been called a worthy successor to that lineage, and I can't argue, because I suspect those old movies wouldn't play well to modern audiences, myself included.

The action sequences are few are far between, and are VERY short. This is not the story of Apes taking over in a Rebellion against humans. It's the story of an exceptionally smart Ape (chimp) who finds his place in the world. If you liked A.I., you will like this. If you are expecting Transformers, Terminator, ID4, etc. don't waste your time.The Movie poster, where you see an angry monkey, and a burning bridge, and a horde of angry gorillas, should instead be a monkey looking longingly toward a forest from a fenced in yard. This would better depict the actual movie.The other gripe I have with this film, is there is nothing new in here. Everything is something taken from other films. The apes escaping is from I-Robot, the bridge scene is from one of the giant spider films, there are many hints of Deep Blue sea in here as well.  We have all seen King Kong, so we seen CG primates before, so.. nothing really new there either.The other big problem I had with the film was that it seems like it was made for the PG or PC crowd. The apes (with very few exceptions) don't kill people. There are SO many scenes where people should be pounded into pudding, or limbs ripped off, or impaled by spears, etc, but nothing like that happens.

A brilliant researcher has developed a new serum that has the potential to cure Alzheimer's, but when his test subjects are killed following after a failed experiment, he is left with only one chimp. Will raises Caesar as his own, as his intelligence begins to grow at an alarming rate. After a freak attack against one of the neighbors, Caesar is forced into a wildlife rescue, where he and each of the other animals are abused and tormented by their jailers, forcing Caesar to rally the other apes in a revolt against humanity!RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES provides a fitting beginning to the fall of mankind, although a sequel certainly seems eminent. Rupert Wyatt brings the film to life using astounding special effects and heart-pounding action that are sure to keep you on the edge of your seat! Although James Franco and John Lithgow attempt to inject some forced sentimentality into the earlier scenes, the main focus always remains on our anti-hero chimp, Caesar. Through cutting-edge motion capture technology, Andy Serkis is able to give this fully-computerized character true life, with personality, heart, and soul that read through his eyes and expressions. Caesar gains sympathy and support in his struggles against mankind, as he suffers time and time again at the hands of his captors. Watching RISE is a bit of an Easter egg hunt as well, with clever cameos and allusions to the other films embedded playfully throughout the script. The only real misstep is that the long running time only provides the beginning to the beginning of the story, and never amounts to the full-scale planetary take-over by the super-intelligent apes.

Monkies aren't as intelligent, or related to humans at all, and they have a long tail!  Apes share a common ancestor that spilt from humans about 2-4 million years ago (these facts aren't in the movie, but I figured that anyone who watches this movie would become a huge fan of apes afterwards).Evolution has proven that apes and humans share a common ancestor, and evolution has evolved mankind to be the most intelligent of the animal kingdom - however, apes have proven (not only by DNA) that they possess the same intelligence - even in reality, apes can be taught to sign, to use its fingers, walk upright, laugh, cry, show emotions, pass memory tests, and even build tools (a chimp was the first mammal to the moon, even before humans, when the USA launched a chimp to space in the '60s) - something that humans had only thought they could do.  These are FACTS, and I thought the viewer might like to know these facts because if you understand the relations of apes and humans better, it makes the movie that much greater.The scenes are beautiful shots, especially the woodland parts that shows them high up top tress with a pan view of the San Francisco skyline of the bridge and everything.  James Franco is very believable as a humane scientist, although I do think he was a bit young to play the part, but still delivered an excellent performance as Caesar's adoptive father.  Of course, the best actor of the movie was Caesar, who is played by Andy Serkis - for those of you who don't know who he is, he played that ugly Gollum hobbit in the Lord of the Rings movies.  He is wonderful as a motion actor for these computerized characters that he plays, his facial impressions are amazing.I won't tell the plot of the story (you can Wikipedia the movie article for that!) - but this is a great box office hit!  I never like sci-fi, I didn't care for any of the Star Wars movies or Star Trek, or Transformers or anything - but this one actually made me cry half-way through the movie.I gave this movie five stars because I loved it so much, but really you should buy the DVD or Blu-ray, because even though I bought the Instant Video of it - it doesn't come with any extras, which I was a bit disappointed about, and you don't get options for subtitles or anything; I mean, I suppose it's okay if you just want to see the movie, seeing as how the Instant Video is less money than the DVD or Blu-ray, even if you buy it.I highly recommend.",5,Very Realistic,1326153600,"01 10, 2012",2012,2672,"['love', 'movie', 'love', 'scientific', 'research', 'was', 'put', 'making', 'movie', 'extensive', 'studies', 'apes', 'particular', 'chimpanzees', 'apes', 'are', 'NOT', 'monkies', 'people', 'stupidly', 'always', 'call', 'Monkies', 'are', ""n't"", 'intelligent', 'related', 'humans', 'have', 'long', 'tail', 'Apes', 'share', 'common', 'ancestor', 'humans', '2-4', 'million', 'years', 'ago', 'facts', 'are', ""n't"", 'movie', 'figured', 'anyone', 'who', 'movie', 'would', 'become', 'huge', 'fan', 'apes', 'afterwards', '.Evolution', 'proven', 'apes', 'humans', 'share', 'common', 'ancestor', 'evolution', 'evolved', 'mankind', 'be', 'most', 'intelligent', 'animal', 'kingdom', 'however', 'apes', 'have', 'proven', 'not', 'only', 'DNA', 'possess', 'same', 'intelligence', 'even', 'reality', 'apes', 'can', 'be', 'taught', 'sign', 'use', 'fingers', 'walk', 'upright', 'laugh', 'cry', 'show', 'emotions', 'pass', 'memory', 'tests', 'even', 'build', 'tools', 'chimp', 'was', 'first', 'mammal', 'moon', 'even', 'humans', 'when', 'USA', 'launched', 'chimp', 'space', ""'60s"", 'something', 'humans', 'had', 'only', 'thought', 'could', 'do', 'are', 'FACTS', 'thought', 'viewer', 'might', 'like', 'know', 'facts', 'understand', 'relations', 'apes', 'humans', 'better', 'movie', 'much', 'greater.The', 'scenes', 'are', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'especially', 'woodland', 'parts', 'high', 'up', 'top', 'tress', 'pan', 'view', 'San', 'Francisco', 'skyline', 'bridge', 'everything', 'James', 'Franco', 'very', 'believable', 'humane', 'scientist', 'do', 'think', 'was', 'bit', 'young', 'play', 'part', 'still', 'delivered', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Caesar', 'adoptive', 'father', 'course', 'best', 'actor', 'movie', 'was', 'Caesar', 'who', 'played', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'played', 'ugly', 'Gollum', 'hobbit', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'movies', 'wonderful', 'motion', 'actor', 'computerized', 'characters', 'facial', 'impressions', 'are', 'amazing.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'plot', 'story', 'can', 'Wikipedia', 'movie', 'article', 'great', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'never', 'sci-fi', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movies', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Transformers', 'anything', 'one', 'actually', 'made', 'cry', 'half-way', 'movie.I', 'gave', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'really', 'should', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'even', 'bought', 'Instant', 'Video', ""n't"", 'come', 'extras', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'options', 'subtitles', 'anything', 'mean', 'suppose', 'okay', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'seeing', 'how', 'Instant', 'Video', 'less', 'money', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'even', 'buy', 'it.I', 'highly', 'recommend']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes
1415515,A2G51QSW9WB8I7,B004LWZW4M,Chip,"[2, 2]","First of all, the film itself. I didn't catch this in theaters but I was aware of all the positive buzz, and I'm a big fan of the original Planet of the Apes movie (don't really care much about the sequels), and I already thought this movie looked interesting. I've watched it twice, and I must say that I really LOVED it the 2nd time. This movie is a terrific reboot/origin story for this series, and while it pays homage to the original, it still manages to be its own film. I loved how focused the movie is; the story is simple but very well thought out and executed. The film doesn't get bogged down in unecessary subplots. And the character of Caesar (especially thanks to Andy Serkis) is one of my favorite charatcers in any film. The CGI is excellent; of course you can tell the apes aren't real, but the CGI is still so lifelike. Also, the fact that they used motion captures made the apes feel like real creatures.  Some people might say that this is a cash-in on the older series, but it isn't. It's a new take on the story and a great one at that. It's definitely one of the best films of 2011.As for the Blu-Ray itself, it's very crisp and clean and the colors pop out at you. The sound is great. The biggest selling point is the extra, since there are some great ones here. There are many featurettes showing the making of the film, from the motion capture performances to the score of the film, etc. One of my favorite features is a mini-documentary about the great apes, covering chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. These animals are beautiful and fascinating, and the viewer really gets to learn some amazing facts about them if they didn't know them already.All in all, this is a great Blu-Ray release of a great movie. It was a blind buy for me and I wasn't disappointed. The Transformers films could learn a few things from this one.",5,Spellbinding! Great Story and Characters!

1415518,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B004LWZW4M,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[5, 7]","From the opening scene of the 2011 film ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" I began to realize this was a shockingly average movie. The human characters are aggressively one dimensional, reacting as inanely as if they were starring in a Michael Bay disaster flick. These poorly written roles do just enough to serve the unimaginative plot, with the lead scientific couple (James Franco and Freida Pinto) appropriately young and attractive to appeal to teens. The performances of some usually very good actors, including Franco, John Lithgow and Brian Cox, are arguably the worst of their careers. And the film's portrayal of Alzheimer's disease is loudly offensive.There are numerous ways this film could be improved, perhaps starting with a new writer (Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver) and director (Rupert Wyatt). ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" becomes interesting the very second the cartoonish humans are shunted to the side and it focuses on the imprisoned CGI apes. At this point I radioed, ""Charlton, we've got a problem."" The special effects are a wonder, with the chimpanzee Caesar particularly fascinating (supposedly played by Andy Serkis, an actor who apparently is an expert in these computer-generated roles). His scenes with the apes at the simian prison are above average, and I loved the introduction of the circus-trained orangutan. How these apes ultimately escape from their cells and conquer - I don't know, San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge? - are the film's most exciting moments.While this final conflict is entertaining and enabled the approval of millions of dollars in budget, it is also unbelievable and stupid. Why not just have the apes escape to the relative safety of the nearby redwood forests? Why have them battle helmeted policemen with guns and what is evidently the lone helicopter available? In brutal reality, if such an uprising occurred, the military replete with dozens of helicopters, tanks, armored cars, killer bulldozers and Dutch Schaefer, would come out of the woodwork. The apes, in possession of nothing more than metal spears and a bad temper, would be mowed down like the Light Brigade.Anyway, one of those corporate science labs movies love to detail has developed a drug that could cure Alzheimer's. A guinea pig-err-chimpanzee is showing remarkable intellectual development. For whatever reason, she's in a bad mood, breaks through numerous windows and doors and amazingly lands on the board room table before shocked executives at the exact moment they discuss the project. Of course, a security guard shoots the maniac chimp dead. Turns out it wasn't the new drug at all but a newborn baby she was protecting, which seems odd considering she did everything but remain with the baby, but no matter.The project is immediately shut down and head scientist Will Rodman (Franco) takes the cute Gremlin-like chimp home as a pet. Yes, the baby inherited the miracle drug, growing into the highly intelligent Caesar who lives in Rockwell-esque harmony in an attic the size of a high school gymnasium. Rodman also finds time to care for his ailing father (Lithgow) who suffers from - you guessed it - Alzheimer's. He can no longer play the piano, uses a fork backwards and enjoys wearing pajamas throughout the day. Caesar makes Rodman's oddly temperamental neighbors uneasy (especially after attempting to bite off their fingers), so he's put into the already-mentioned medieval dungeon ape pound. Caesar's mistreated with a high-pressure water hose and the Darwinian uprising begins.I loved the five original ""Planet of the Apes"" films (Planet Of The Apes (1968),Beneath The Planet Of The Apes[1970],Escape From The Planet Of The Apes[1971],Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes[1972],Battle For The Planet Of The Apes[1973]), one of the many joys of growing up in the 1970s. I also watched the TV series (Planet of the Apes: The Complete TV Series[1974]) and the Saturday morning cartoon (Return to the Planet of the Apes - The Complete Animated Series[1975]). ""Rise"" appears to be a pseudo-remake of ""Conquest,"" though quotes verbatim from the original ""Planet."" It's not as good as either film and is even inferior to Tim Burton's muddled 2001 remakePlanet Of The Apes. Remaking the 1970's Ape films is not necessarily a bad thing, and I'll be the first to admit they decreased in quality leading towards the concluding ""Battle"" (which I watched with a childhood friend and afterwards, we walked home from the neighborhood theater shuffling like apes). But there was an earnestness and enjoyable sense of humor, not to mention the fine performances of Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a perfect example of modern filmmakers relying almost entirely on computer-generated images as a substitute for wit, imagination and character development. It has the overall stink of a Sci-Fi Channel Movie-of-the-Week and borrows heavily from other superior films.The most obvious isAvatar (Two-Disc Original Theatrical Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo). But take a look at the human characters in James Cameron's modern classic, specifically the villain Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang). He has multiple scenes of revelation and a minutes-long discussion when he describes his early missions on the planet. He's most certainly evil, but with fascinating depth carrying the scars of life's misfortune. We understand his Ahab-like rage. Even the scientist Grace (Sigourney Weaver) does not fit any cookie-cutter mold, sucking a cigarette, foul-mouthed and aggressive. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" has little time for such color or dimension.When the computer-generated characters are more interesting than the human ones, there's a problem. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is one of the worst big-budget films of the year.",2,"Charlton, we've got a problem...",1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,5793,"['opening', 'scene', '2011', 'film',

1415523,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004LWZW4M,C. Sawin,"[3, 5]","Planet of the Apes is one of those franchises I never really saw the appeal in. The original one is the only one that seems to get continuous praise from people, but it along with its four sequels have been labeled as dated more than anything else. Then there was the Tim Burton remake from 2001 that nearly everyone says is terrible. It's usually referred to as ""the one with Marky Mark"" and I overheard a conversation a row ahead of me earlier tonight where somebody said, ""I couldn't even finish it."" So I was essentially entering Rise of the Planet of the Apes with a fresh mind; seeing it as a standalone film rather than a reboot of a franchise. To be honest though, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is excellent no matter how you look at it.The compelling story is what really makes the movie. It makes you feel sympathy for these apes in ways you probably can't even fathom when you're first sitting down to see it. The relationship between Caesar (Andy Serkis) and Will Rodman (James Franco) is the heart and soul of the movie. Caesar's facial expressions and actions just immediately make your chest tighten and heart beat in ways to let you know you're seeing something special. If Andy Serkis is involved in any way when it comes to motion capture technology being used in an upcoming movie expect magic because that's what you're going to receive. You feel more for Caesar than anyone else in the movie and you should. It is a movie about apes taking over the world after all.Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a smart movie; plain and simple. There's a lot of scientific jargon thrown in there and whether it's all legitimate or not it all comes together in a way that makes sense. It's story structure is brilliant, as well. It starts off a little slow and shows how Caesar becomes a part of Will's life while also showing the struggle Will's father Charles (John Lithgow) is going through with a case of Alzheimer's that's quickly making his health deteriorate. Will works for the Gen-Sys lab, which develops antidotes that they test on primates with hopes of it curing human disease. ALZ 112 is what they hope will cure Alzheimer's, but it backfires. It has an alternative effect on humans than it does on apes; humans tend to get sick and die while it makes apes more intelligent. As the years pass, Caesar and Will become close but they're separated after Will is forced to put Caesar in a primate reserve. As Will focuses on trying to save his father's life and bring Caesar back home, Caesar begins planning a revolution and starts to relate to his brethren.There are a few references to the original Planet of the Apes films. Since I haven't seen them, I was really only able to catch a few of them. The cool thing about them though is that they can be looked at as planted seeds for potential sequels or just as a throwback to where the movie originated from. That's something special in itself; a movie able to accomplish something open-ended.The cast is pretty fantastic, as well. James Franco has always been an actor with the potential to deliver a great performance and he does so here. John Lithgow was a pleasant surprise as I wasn't aware he was a part of the cast until I saw him on-screen. The way he handles Alzheimer's is really incredible. Andy Serkis, as already mentioned, is the guy that makes the whole thing come together; Caesar is just amazing. Brian Cox makes a brief appearance as a rather low-life individual and Tom Felton plays his son who's a lot like Draco Malfoy in personality. Tyler Labine takes a break from comedy to show he's not too bad at drama while David Oyelowo shows how you can be despicable while just trying to do what's best for the company you work for. The strong cast is just as impressive as the fascinating storyline.This is the first Planet of the Apes movie to use CGI effects rather than actors in prosthetic makeup. You may be asking yourself how that's going to look. Don't put much thought into it; it looks outstanding. Weta Digital really outdid themselves with this movie. Everything blends together so well that the apes look genuinely realistic the entire time. Their emotions are portrayed to perfection, which is probably the most important aspect of this movie. I'm a pretty big stickler when it comes to the more exciting sequences in modern films being littered with noticeable CGI creatures in front of a green screen. That sort of thing is so minimal that I honestly can't remember having that feeling during Rise of the Planet of the Apes. So not only do you get great action, you get seamless special effects as well.Rise of the Planet of the Apes is ridiculously good on all fronts. It features an excellent cast, an absorbing storyline, explosive action, and marvelous special effects. This is easily one of the best films of the year. Rise of the Planet of the Apes is emotional, exciting, and mesmerizing; it's everything a summer movie should be and monkey mayhem at its finest.",4,Sensational,1312502400,"08 5,

1415527,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B004LWZW4M,DanD,"[1, 1]","When I first saw the trailers for RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, I had several thoughts: What an awful title; James Franco is doing his wooden caricature thing again; animated animals mixed with live-action humans hasn't really worked since WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT; and do we really need this, or is Hollywood milking yet another franchise for all it's worth?Well, the latter may be the case, but at least they're doing it right this time.  First, the flaws: the script is necessarily short, with several films' worth of info crammed into 100 minutes; there are too many side-stories that deviate from the main plot; the storyline is predictable, and plays upon everything even remotely similar that's come before it; and quite honestly, it takes too long for the apes to revolt.  In fact, the film could have benefited from an R rating; there doesn't need to be any (more) violence/gore, but darker tones could have been examined further.  The film's greatest scenes are the ones that truly make you ponder the horrendous possibility of nature turning its claws on us.These are the flaws, and there are several.  However, there are a lot of good things about APES, even a couple of great things.  Director Rupert Wyatt knows how to craft a great shot, and the pace remains steady, even when the script is tempted to dip into maudlin schmaltz.  James Franco's performance is delightfully nuanced; he's been better elsewhere, but we've also seen him far, far worse.  Andy Serkis more or less carries this film; I don't know if his performance is truly Oscar-worthy, but it's certainly more worthy than some past winners (admittedly, I have pretty high standards).  Serkis utterly changes the tone of the film with a simple look.  Supporting roles aren't quite fleshed out (Frida Pinto, as Franco's girlfriend, is pretty much there for female support/companionship), but certain actors (namely, John Lithgow, as always) make the most of them.  Also look for Tom Felton doing his Draco Malfoy thing, and for some reason it's not tiring, probably because nobody does petulant bullying better than him, at least not since the 80's.RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is far from perfect; and indeed, there have been better--and bigger--summer blockbusters.  But it's still a fun ride, filled with great visuals (I hesitate to use the term ""special effects,"" as it seems somewhat dated) and pretty solid acting.  I'm not sure if the film has sold me on a sequel (and you know one is coming), but it's definitely a solid examination of the origins of the original series, both overtly and subtly.  Definitely a must-see for science-driven thriller fans, and those interested in just HOW those damned dirty apes took control of humanity.

1415529,A3U7ELIED4WP4R,B004LWZW4M,Dark Faerie Tales,"[3, 5]","The Review:There have been many larger than life heroes of the silver screen. Kurt Douglas' Spartacus, Russell Crowes' Gladiator, and Mel Gibson's Braveheart. Now to that august company of heroes must be added Andy Serkis' Caesar from Rise of the Planet of the Apes. But Caesar is unlike any of the others. Though he is every bit as heroic, and in many ways more complex, Caesar is a chimpanzee.Rise of the Planet of the Apes is the prequel to the 1968 classic, The Planet of the Apes starring Charleton Heston. Rise tells the story of how it came to pass that our simian cousins skipped ahead of us on the evolutionary ladder. The story of Rise is told in such a way that it fits perfectly within the continuity of the original film. By the way, I highly recommend seeing the original as it really is one of the pillars of dystopian sci-fi. When you watch it, keep in mind that it was made more than 40 years ago and how cutting edge it must have seemed to that audience in terms of both story and special effects.After seeing the trailers for Rise, I expected a good movie. What I got was a great one and it is my favorite movie of the year so far. From its opening sequence to the closing credits, Rise hits all the high points for which storytellers strive. While I thoroughly enjoyed Thor, Captain America and X-Men First Class, Rise had an emotional impact well beyond what I experienced with those other great movies.Before the end of Rise you will come to know and love Caesar, a combination of computer generated imagery and the movements of actor, Andy Serkis, who also did the movement for King Kong in Peter Jackson's amazing film of the same name. Serkis' performance is all the more amazing since it's composed almost entirely of his motion captured facial expressions and body movement. Not many actors can do their best work under such restrictions. Andy Serkis is in a class by himself in this regard.Rise plays on our collective fascination with primates other than ourselves. Chimpanzees are eerily like us. They have personalities, live in groups and even wage war against other groups of chimpanzees. The ability of Rise to tell a story, in which apes and chimpanzees are every bit the star that their human counterparts are, is a rather amazing bit of film making. This is obviously the result of a lot of special effects, but I never once saw anything ""fake"" about the film's FX. Yes, intellectually I know that chimps were not taking direction or immersing themselves in the method school of acting. But damned if every scene didn't look as if real animals were on screen. Only King Kong and Avatar have ever made me forget I was looking at computer generated effects the way Rise did.Rise of the Planet of the Apes has as much action as any of the blockbusters of the summer of 2011, but it has a lot more heart. Caesar is part superhero, part freedom fighter and part Moses. If that sounds ridiculous, trust me, it isn't. Rise, by focusing on a non human character manages to explore the very essence of heroism, and our desire to be free. In many ways Caesar is as ""human"" as any of us.

There are so many references to the Charlton Heston version that your enjoyment of this film will be seriously affected if you don't recognise them.The plot, as far as it exists, focuses on a super intelligent chimp baby that the scientist hero of the film adopts. He's been experimenting on chimps to see whether a new drug can help reverse the effect of Alzheimer's. As time goes by the chimp (called Caesar) grows up into an unruly animal and eventually finds himself locked away in a nasty primate camp.The movie is marred by stupendously inept characterisation. I saw it 12 hours ago and can't remember the name of the hero. It doesn't really matter, since he and his chimp-loving girlfriend are mere props. The hero works for a nasty boss who is determined to press ahead with the development of the drug -- tested on innocent defenceless chimps, naturally enough -- despite evidence it might harm humans. Boo to the evil one-dimensional boss!Without giving too much of the plot away, I can reveal that Caesar quickly knocks sense into the rest of the apes in the sanctuary and helps them escape, whereupon they wreak havoc in downtown San Francisco before trying to flee over the Golden Gate Bridge to the famed redwood forests. Blocking their way are hundreds of armed police, just waiting to shoot down the pesky simian escapees.

The portrayal of him as chimp, but a chimp with human intelligence was superb.  Never did this movie cause me to lose sight of the fact he was a chimp (easy to do when giving animals human characteristics) nor did I ever think of him as less than intelligent.The interaction between the various apes (pre-gassing) is from what I can tell pretty close to genuine.I left this movie wanting more.  I left this movie wanting to see the next movie where the Will Rodman (James Franco) acts as an ambassador on the behalf of the apes to establish the area of forest their in as sovereign ground, the apes not happy with being confined initially try to leave and integrate and eventually decide to have their own revolution after being treated as, well, damned dirty apes.

1415536,A21FCUWIL5I6B0,B004LWZW4M,"D. Christianson ""Shorty""","[17, 29]","Watched this movie again and still cannot figure out the high ratings. Even with the suspension of disbelieve requried with all movies this is film still has a terrible finish. CGI is good but the finale still makes the movie feel like a low budget B movie. It's so hokey and 1970's type of BS I can't believe it! Very unimpressive! James Franco still gives the same unemotional an wooden performance he's famous for. This may have been his most emotional performance but that's not saying much. He had more emotion and fun in Your Highness than he did in this waste of time. Sorry for those of you who think I've never seen a movie but movies are one of my passions along with reading good books. I've seen thousands of movies. I can usually find something positive in all of them. Turner Classic Movies is one of my favorite channels. Unfortunately this movie still disappoints on all fronts. It starts out great but the last-45-60 minutes of of the movie destroy what could have been a masterpiece. I suspect most reviews are giving this film such a high rating for the first half hour of the film and totally ignoring the last half/two thirds of the film. Still a terrible ending! The action at the end is just terrible!! Makes an A list movie into a low class B-list movie. Still not very good. Too bad people are so influenced by CGI instead of good plots and good execution by quality actors. This is an example of a typically over-hyped, over advertised film that didn't make it at the box office (because it's not very good) so the movie company pushed DVD sales by creating a lot of positive ratings on Amazon.Not sure what the five star reviewers saw in this movie. The first part of the movie had some promise with some good character developement. Definately had some potential but did not follow thru. The last half of the movie is far too unrealistic and ruins the movie. Where is th US Military when the apes break out? Don't you think at least the Natiional Guard with automatic weapons would have been called out after the damage the apes did? Even without the military how could all the automatic weapons the police had miss the unarmed chimps?In the real world the unarmed apes would have been cut to pieces no matter how smart they are. Do you really think a hundred hunted apes could really take over 750 million humans, even if they are as smart as we are?  They would have to breed litters of 100 plus offspring for a thousand years just to match the population assuming humans continued to have children. Far too many hunters with top notch weapons for this to happen no matter how smart the apes become.  Also, it looked like a major California city so why only one helicoptor with no real weapons? Come on, one guy with a hand held automatic weapon in the helicoptor and it's taken out by a jumping gorilla? Pathetic! Once again in the real world a helicoptor with machine gun would cut the unarmed opponents to shreds. Those that escaped would be hunted unmercifully. Too few apes and too many US citizens with guns to hunt the apes down to make this movie even close to realistic. No matter how smart the apes (and the couldn't have been too smart since the couldn't figure out how to use guns) this movie sucked. No matter how smart the apes, pure numbers ensure their destruction.  I can suspend disbelief but this movie tried to carry it way too far. The script started to develope empathy for some of the characters at the beginning of the film but lost it by the end.

1415542,A3W3X1WBBY6I6B,B004LWZW4M,D. Fadden,"[2, 4]","I had very mixed emotions re. this film.  I'm a huge Roddy fan, a huge fan of Kim Hunter and Charlton Heston and the original film, and of course I have all the old movies AND the TV series too, mostly because I couldn't get enough.  Of all the Apes characters, none (in my opinion) are as important as Caesar, who reinvents the future with the compassion and wisdom learned from the legacy left him by his humane parents Cornelius and Zira, and the mistakes of the original future (what then becomes the past), which ultimately causes the destruction of the world.In this version we have no original future.  Caesar is not the child of future apes at all, but rather the accidental result of an experimental drug.  In my view this premise is more realistic, but at the same time it takes away from the time loop the Apes saga was famous for & made it so unique.Impressive is the digitally created Caesar.  I was not disappointed, even though I expected to be.  What I did not like (at all) was his voice.  The voice was important. The original Caesar had only two ways to express himself--his eyes and voice.  They did justice to one (the eyes) but not the other. Also I find it quite telling (of Mr. Mcdowall's talent), that a human being in a crude (by today's standards) ape costume & mask can pull of more expression (eyes and voice) than the best efforts of digital invention we have today.  The Caesar in this film is breath-taking in his facial expressions and realism.  He too has the compassionate soul and keen intelligence.  But he is not the Caesar I love.  He does not have the passion or fire or rage or hope ringing in his voice and blazing in his eyes that made the very campy 1970's ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"" a stand out--Caesar's powerful moving monolog at the very end of that film.  How can an actor in a mask produce so much emotion that even watching it today I find myself rewinding that old film and watching that scene again, marveling at the power.  Nothing tops that scene, or comes close to the depth of soul Roddy gives the original Caesar.  ALL the techno-digital whatever, and still it doesn't come close.  Tipping my hat to the (sadly) deceased Roddy.)It's still by far and away the best Apes movie since the original--I think so anyway.  The films that followed the original film, the sequels, are all favorites of mine, but campy, faded echoes of the original film.  Still my favorite scene of all the films has to be the dialog of Caesar standing on the steps with flames as the backdrop and the blazing passion pouring from his form--even through the primitive monkey suit.Proving, I think, that animated characters like we saw in Avatar and here and in Lord of the Rings, are wonderful to behold, and so realistic we can feel along with them and love them--cheer for them.  But they do not and never will have the human element that only a dynamic and talented living breathing actor can give.What I didn't like about this film--the subtitles/dialogue between Caesar and the Orangatan (sp?).  It would have been better with gestures--something.  Anything.  I found the subtitles distracting and the conversations between the two apes rather simplistic and stupid.What I loved about this film--the drop of blood at the very end when you think the film is over, but then you see the true downfall of humanity, the spread of a disease that apes are immune to, but swiftly kills humans.  This promises future sequels to a whole new spin/take on the original apes films. I'm looking forward.  I welcome these new films, and I'll savor every moment.  I just can't think about the original and fully enjoy...because nothing comes close to Kim Hunter's Zira or the fire and strength of a Caesar only Roddy Mcdowall could produce:""Where there is fire, there is smoke. And in that smoke, from this day forward, my people will crouch and conspire and plot and plan for the inevitable day of Man's downfall - the day when he finally and self-destructively turns his weapons against his own kind. The day of the writing in the sky, when your cities lie buried under radioactive rubble! When the sea is a dead sea, and the land is a wasteland out of which I will lead my people from their captivity! And we will build our own cities in which there will be no place for humans except to serve our ends! And we shall found our own armies, our own religion, our own dynasty! And that day is upon you... now!""(from the original ending of Conquest of the Planet of the Apes.  This was later edited and the additional was added to the toned down less violent version of the ending of the film:""But now... now we will put away our hatred. Now we will put down our weapons. We have passed through the night of the fires, and those who were our masters are now our servants. And we, who are not human, can afford to be humane. Destiny is the will of God, and if it is Man's destiny to be dominated, it is God's will that he be dominated with compassion, and understanding. So, cast out your vengeance.

The original ""Planet Of The Apes"" (and the series it spawned) was both serious science fiction and serious camp/kitsch, and this well-paced, well-written, well-realized prequel follows in that pathway, mixing humor with drama, as we see the genesis of the ape-dominated world that humbled Charleton Heston. In the original film, we were left to guess what made the primates evole so rapidly, with genetic mutation after a humans-only nuclear war as the apparent cause. I still prefer that explanation, but Cold War fears are less resonant today than the potential perils of genetic experimentation, and so the animal-research scenario shown here works just as well. I enjoyed this film quite a bit, and was eager at the end to see the next installment -- the real war between humans and apes! oh boy! -- as well as the character growth of the Caesar and his various followers.

James Franco has shown more versatility in previous leading roles, but his character in Apes is intended to be about as straightforward and vanilla as it gets, so that's precisely what he delivers. The real focus is on the apes themselves, anyway, with whom the picture treads lightly amidst some very tricky material.

In this latest iteration, which is a solid prequel, I couldn't help thinking of the introduction to a book. If you were to read nothing more than introductions, you'd never learn or experience anything except what the book might or might not be about - and this movie is the equivalent of an introduction. It isn't bad as a prequel to the original story; but it's nothing more.While I liked it a great deal, I'm not so sure I want to see the franchise that will arise from this kind of introduction. With a prequel to an old classic film, what you get is a disproportionately higher number of in-betweequels than usual; it's guaranteed they will stink progressively worse and worse.James Franco stars as a goofy scientist racing to cure Alzheimer's Disease at a genetic level. In a lab - full of what else but chimps - he finally acquires a vaccine at the cost of nearly all the chimps' lives. An infant born the day of the massacre is taken home by Franco, named Caesar (acted by Andy Serkis who is then blotted out a la Gollum), and raised by him. Being ordered to turn Caesar over to the ""chimp farm"", well, the rest is for you to discover.It won't be much, and it won't be a surprise. Unless you count the lead chimp suddenly being able to speak, which even the Einstein of the chimpanzees could not do; they don't have the little bone in their throats that makes human speech possible.Audiences will find a few tingles similar to the ones we felt seeing the originalPlanet of the Apes, because one feels that when seeing anthropomorphosed apes. Here, it's pure CGI, so you can expect the chimps and other apes to look like cartoons. Frankly, Caesar looks like a Homo Erectus version of James Franco. It makes one wonder if standards slipped that badly, money was too tight or these producers are just plain stupid.There are lots of homages to the original film here, as you might expect, plus a few references to a wide diversity fromRantoHarry Potter: The Complete 8-Film Collection. The soundtrack is a HARRY POTTER rip-off and it's a pity. You will also note, if you pay attention, that Charleton Heston's famous spaceship Icarus launches at this time.This film heralds a cheap, ugly franchise that will hopefully wither due to unpopularity. The deep, painful lessons this film might have taught us were thrown out the window along with the producers' common sense. I was more impressed with Tim Burton's silly remakePlanet of the Apes, which is a perennial favorite of ours, mainly due to the actors.With appearances by John Lithgow, Brian Cox and the usually adorable Tom Felton (Draco of HARRY POTTER fame, once again humiliated in one of the most evil-little-weasel roles in history).",3,This isn't a petting zoo ... and it's barely a prequel ... perhaps it's a prequel to a petting zoo!,1327190400,"01 22, 2012",2012,2749,"['PLANET', 'THE', 'APES', 'dir', 'Rupert', 'Wyatt', '106', 'minutes', 'latest', 'iteration', 'solid', 'prequel', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'introduction', 'book', 'were', 'read', 'nothing', 'more', 'introductions', ""'d"", 'never', 'learn', 'experience', 'anything', 'what', 'book', 'might', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'movie', 'equivalent', 'introduction', ""n't"", 'bad', 'prequel', 'original', 'story', 'nothing', 'more.While', 'liked', 'great', 'deal', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'want', 'see', 'franchise', 'will', 'arise', 'kind', 'introduction', 'prequel', 'old', 'classic', 'film', 'what', 'get', 'disproportionately', 'higher', 'number', 'in-betweequels', 'usual', 'guaranteed', 'will', 'stink', 'progressively', 'worse', 'worse.James', 'Franco', 'stars', 'goofy', 'scientist', 'racing', 'cure', 'Alzheimer', 'Disease', 'genetic', 'level', 'lab', 'full', 'what', 'else', 'finally', 'vaccine', 'cost', 'nearly', 'chimps', 'lives', 'infant', 'born', 'day', 'massacre', 'taken', 'home', 'Franco', 'named', 'Caesar', 'acted', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'who', 'then', 'blotted', 'out', 'la', 'Gollum', 'raised', 'Being', 'ordered', 'turn', 'Caesar', 'chimp', 'farm', 'well', 'rest', 'discover.It', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprise', 'count', 'lead', 'chimp', 'suddenly', 'being', 'able', 'speak', 'even', 'Einstein', 'chimpanzees', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'little', 'bone', 'throats', 'human', 'speech', 'possible.Audiences', 'will', 'find', 'few', 'tingles', 'similar', 'ones', 'felt', 'seeing', 'originalPlanet', 'Apes', 'one', 'feels', 'when', 'seeing', 'anthropomorphosed', 'apes', 'Here', 'pure', 'CGI', 'can', 'expect', 'chimps', 'other', 'apes', 'look', 'cartoons', 'Frankly', 'Caesar', 'Homo', 'Erectus', 'version', 'James', 'Franco', 'one', 'wonder', 'standards', 'slipped', 'badly', 'money', 'was', 'too', 'tight', 'producers', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid.There', 'are', 'lots', 'homages', 'original', 'film', 'here', 'might', 'expect', 'few', 'references', 'wide', 'diversity', 'fromRantoHarry', 'Potter', 'Complete', '8-Film', 'Collection', 'soundtrack', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'rip-off', 'pity', 'will', 'also', 'note', 'pay', 'attention', 'Charleton', 'Heston', 'famous', 'spaceship', 'Icarus', 'time.This', 'film', 'cheap', 'ugly', 'franchise', 'will', 'hopefully', 'wither', 'due', 'unpopularity', 'deep', 'painful', 'lessons', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'taught', 'were', 'thrown', 'out', 'window', 'producers', 'common', 'sense', 'was', 'more', 'impressed', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'silly', 'remakePlanet', 'Apes', 'perennial', 'favorite', 'ours', 'mainly', 'due', 'actors.With', 'appearances', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'usually', 'adorable', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'Draco', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'fame', 'once', 'again', 'humiliated', 'one', 'most', 'evil-little-weasel', 'roles', 'history']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes
1415564,AMMXFNJSKJUQ,B004LWZW4M,ElectricMelody,"[1, 1]","**Originally posted on ""#1 Hits From Another Planet"" - 8/11/11**Okay, so I went from ""why did this movie need to be made?"" to ""this actually looks pretty good"" in the past few weeks, but now after seeing it I'm leaning more towards my initial impressions.A lot of critics and viewers have seemed surprised that Rise of the Apes is as good as it is. That was part of the reason I started getting excited to watch it. And I think it is that good... for awhile. The first third is totally solid, setting up an ethical conflict with a lot of potential. Even more than that, the special effects are to be applauded. They're easily the best thing about the film. The motion capture technology (and acting work of Andy Serkis, who helped bring the apes alive) is nothing short of astounding. These creatures definitely don't feel digital, particularly the main ape, Cesar. In fact, he gives the central, most memorable performance in the film.The problems start to appear in the sluggish second act. To me, at least, the inciting incident came a little too late and the aftermath (involving a horrible animal ""shelter"") eats up much of the movie (too much, imo). Sidenote: If you're a Tom Felton (aka Draco Malfoy) fan, it's kind of fun to watch him attempt an American accent (which he sort of succeeds with). Then we get to the conclusion, which is where I finally made up my mind about the movie. The problem is, it's so inevitable that you're just waiting for it to come. And when it finally does, I was left a little underwhelmed. I mean, once you see the movie, you'll understand why Cesar was so angry that he needed to lash out at the humans (you'll be right there with him, trust me), but the whole ""ape uprising"" seemed a little drastic and out-of-nowhere to me. I don't know, maybe it was just me.Even with all of these nitpicks, I'm still mildly recommending the movie. The opening third (and the effects) are so good that it makes it a solid rental.

I see other 'reviewers' derailing the film for having no realism (this IS a sci-fi film, by the way, an attempted hard sci-fi at that).No one is paying attention. The true star of this film is the editing. We are not left to suffer the ten / fifteen minutes it takes a character to start a process; we know the character is about to try something, scene skips to the attempt. At one hour forty-four minutes, we get the information dump of a three hour film.Bare Bones: the film has virtually no violence outside the neighbourhood chase scene. The count of human death is barely noticeable and in fact five, for an entire supposedly intro to human-v-ape war. But this isn't the war. The reason a few hundred or so apes beat back humanity is two fold: the apes were only trying to find an effective new home, not destroy the oppressive humans; they didn't have to. Within a very small number of years the 113 strain of the virus has obliterated the human population.The movie is understated. It moves so quick that a jaded mind, thinking they know what's gonna happen, will miss at least a quarter of the understated plot.

Hopefully, you would be invested in the film by that time and won't mind any of these stretches.The premise of the film centers around a man trying to find a cure for alzheimer's. So he works on viruses that would fight against that disease and even repair damage and increase brain power. So, of course, they test it on monkeys and look for side effects.I don't think I'm spoiling any secrets by saying the drug does indeed make the apes smarter and significantly and quickly. There are a series of logical events that lead to the eventual 'rise' of the apes.The culmination of this occurs on Golden Gate Bridge, which serves as a literal gateway for the apes to their intended new home and from their human oppressors. So they duke it out.There are lapses in logic here and there once we accept the virus and its effects. Are they worth even mentioning? Only if you are a nitpicker with every film. I'm not. I enjoyed this film much more than I expected.The CGI apes are incredibly well done. As are the rest of the visuals. It's a stunning film to watch. The interplay between the apes and the progression of the film was very impressive. It was smart. The filmmakers obviously did a lot of homework. It was simultaneously fascinating, spooky and sad at times to watch this film because the emotions of the apes, particularly Caesar, were so convincing.The cast? Very good. I do think that Pinto was underused and I would hope in the sequel she would be more than just the cute girlfriend. Or maybe she isn't really that good an actress and just needs to be pretty? I don't know. This is the only film of hers I've seen.The film feels like part I of a trilogy. I can see it now and won't say why because it involves spoilers but the ending of this film feels like it is moving towards the central part of a certain obvious story arc.It is not quite as brilliant or shocking as the original Planet of the Apes. It is, however, second only to that fine film of all the 'apes' films. Especially the clunky and silly Tim Burton film. But this is a much smarter film and doesn't go for cheap gimmicks. The makers of this film clearly respected the story and wanted to make more than just another blockbuster.

If hundreds of monkeys overran a city..they'd be shot on sight. Easy! The inherent lack of any adequate quick reaction force in an American city after the break-out ruined the effect for me. It just wouldn't happen on horse-back with batons.What ever happened to the classic movies of the 70s and 80s that even today have us queuing up to buy the Blu-Ray?

1415592,A16FUU8WW76QFY,B004LWZW4M,gork57,"[1, 2]","Rise of the Planet of the Apes is everything the critics have said--and much more. Yes, it is a tour-de-force performance by Andy Serkis, and is a masterpiece of motion-capture CGI effects work. The film pays homage to the Charlton Heston original, and the descending quality films that followed it. But there is a much more powerful message beneath all that: the plight of apes and other animals humans use for experiments, entertainment, and zoos. There is also a message about what happens to these  beings when they are no longer ""cute,"" and become what they really were to begin with.The thing that gets you about ""Rise"" is when you look into their eyes, and it's not just Caesar, the central character and real star of the film. Go to one of the several websites for chimpanzee sanctuaries, and look at the photographs of the many, many animals that have been rescued from laboratories. On many of them you will see the exact same look of suffering so realistically portrayed in the film. ""Rise"" is supposed to be science fiction and entertainment, but this part of it was taken from something that is REAL, and is happening as I write this review. The fact is that chimpanzees, gorillas, bonobos, and orangutans have been subjected to almost exactly what is seen in this film for many decades.The makers of this film are to be commended for using CGI instead of trained Great Apes. Many people around the world have little idea that the cute chimps used in many television commercials are youngsters less than 5 years old. They also have no idea what happens to them when they become adults. Most often they are disposed of by putting them into labs or sanctuaries, living out their remaining days in cages. ""Rise"" hits home there too. The recent episode of the woman whose face and hands were literally torn off by a ""pet"" chimp shows how wrong human perceptions of these intelligent creatures can be.In every instance, the Great Ape species are losing the battle for survival in the places where they really belong: in the wild. Meanwhile, thousands of them languish in captivity to serve the needs of humans: medical, entertainment, and so forth. If ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" does anything beyond just entertainment, perhaps it will reflect a mirror on the humans who see it--and perhaps illuminate us to who the real ""animals"" are. ""Rise"" is actually an allegory, if only we in our self-exalted position of Masters of the Earth are smart enough to see it.",5,Far More Than Just Entertainment,1313712000,"08 19, 2011",2011,2473,"['Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'everything', 'critics', 'have', 'said', 'much', 'more', 'Yes', 'tour-de-force', 'performance', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'masterpiece', 'motion-capture', 'CGI', 'effects', 'work', 'film', 'homage', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'original', 'descending', 'quality', 'films', 'followed', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'message', 'beneath', 'plight', 'apes', 'other', 'animals', 'humans', 'use', 'experiments', 'entertainment', 'zoos', 'also', 'message', 'what', 'beings', 'when', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'cute', 'become', 'what', 'really', 'were', 'begin', 'with.The', 'thing', 'Rise', 'when', 'look', 'eyes', 'not', 'just', 'Caesar', 'central', 'character', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'Go', 'one', 'several', 'websites', 'chimpanzee', 'sanctuaries', 'look', 'photographs', 'many', 'many', 'animals', 'have', 'been', 'rescued', 'laboratories', 'many', 'will', 'see', 'exact', 'same', 'look', 'suffering', 'so', 'realistically', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Rise', 'supposed', 'be', 'science', 'fiction', 'entertainment', 'part', 'was', 'taken', 'something', 'REAL', 'happening', 'write', 'review', 'fact', 'chimpanzees', 'gorillas', 'bonobos', 'orangutans', 'have', 'been', 'subjected', 'almost', 'exactly', 'what', 'seen', 'film', 'many', 'decades.The', 'makers', 'film', 'are', 'be', 'commended', 'using', 'CGI', 'instead', 'trained', 'Great', 'Apes', 'Many', 'people', 'world', 'have', 'little', 'idea', 'cute', 'chimps', 'used', 'many', 'television', 'commercials', 'are', 'youngsters', 'less', '5', 'years', 'old', 'also', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'when', 'become', 'adults', 'Most', 'often', 'are', 'disposed', 'putting', 'labs', 'sanctuaries', 'living', 'out', 'remaining', 'days', 'cages', 'Rise', 'home', 'there', 'too', 'recent', 'episode', 'woman', 'face', 'hands', 'were', 'literally', 'torn', 'off', 'pet', 'chimp', 'how', 'wrong', 'human', 'perceptions', 'intelligent', 'creatures', 'can', 'be.In', 'instance', 'Great', 'Ape', 'species', 'are', 'losing', 'battle', 'survival', 'places', 'where', 'really', 'belong', 'wild', 'Meanwhile', 'thousands', 'languish', 'captivity', 'serve', 'needs', 'humans', 'medical', 'entertainment', 'so', 'forth', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'anything', 'just', 'entertainment', 'perhaps', 'will', 'reflect', 'mirror', 'humans', 'who', 'see', 'perhaps', 'illuminate', 'who', 'real', 'animals', 'are', 'Rise', 'actually', 'allegory', 'only', 'self-exalted', 'position', 'Masters', 'Earth', 'are', 'smart', 'enough', 'see']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

If that is the thought about RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES then give this film a chance. It has a lot of nuances we don't expect from movies of this genre - introducing the concept of genetic therapy, for example - in addition to the fact that it has a superb cast on both extremes of the animal spectrum!The principal player is Caesar (beautifully enacted by Andy Serkis at the later age and by Terry Notary in the early phase), a chimpanzee who gains human-like intelligence and emotions from the experimental drug ALZ 112, a drug that causes neurogenesis, which allows the brain to grow new brain cells (something that doesn't happen after birth) and heal any number of degenerative brain disorders, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. The only side effect is that the subjects exposed to the drug have a green sparkle to the eyes. Raised like a child by the drug's creator, Will Rodman (James Franco in a very fine, sensitive role) and a primatologist Caroline Aranha (Freida Pinto), Caesar ultimately finds himself taken from the humans he loves and imprisoned in an ape sanctuary in San Bruno. Seeking justice for his fellow inmates, Caesar gives the fellow apes the same drug that he inherited. He then assembles a simian army and escapes the sanctuary - putting man and ape on a collision course with dire possibilities.Blended into this story are some fine subplots and the presence of such excellent actors as John Lithgow, Brian Cox, David Oyelowo among others. The screenplay was written by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver whose ideas came form the Pierre Boulle novel,  `La plan&egrave;te des singes'. The direction is in the sure hands of Rupert Wyatt and of course considerable credit is due to the special effects and costume/makeup crew.  This is a fine summer evening's entertainment!

Franco's performance as a scientist was about as far removed as Hollywood's poorly educated writer's and directors have written on how scientists generally talk, behave and think and on how research is conducted especially with primates. The write-in of the over-th- top attractive female vet love interest was also as Hollywood as it comes. The research center's top exec was portrayed in the same way that Wall Street execs are shown as if they are all rubber stamped out of the same greed mold. The primate rescue center employees behavior towards the animals as well as the cops shoot first portrayals were again just more Hollywood and is getting tiresome in it's predictability.Second, the storyline that centers on a single drug immediately creating intelligence in both humans and primates was absurd as well as the measuring tool of placing discs on top of each other in the fewest number of tries. It's an old child's game and actually only measures a very small part of intelligence. Also, developing language involves many parts of the brain as well as sound creating neurophysiological capabilities. Finally, the planning and execution of an attack by the various primates was just as absurd.Summary: I'm not sure why the movie was made since the original series said all that really needed to be said.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[6, 9]","How subversive is RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES that it convinces you to root for the intelligent apes as they run amok in San Francisco, as their unnatural rebellion heralds the demise of man? Raise your digits if you were less than enthused when you first heard they were making a prequel to the PLANET OF THE APES franchise? Yeah, mine right up there with you. Except that this film, gripping and full of humanity and exceedingly well told, proves us to be a bunch of judgmental asshats. Continuity-wise, RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES folds nicely into the canon.James Franco plays the opposite bookend to Prometheus. Prometheus delivered onto man the gift of fire. Set in present-day San Francisco, Franco's character is Will Rodman, a scientist mucking about in the field of neurogenesis. Will, whose father is stricken with Alzheimer's, believes that he's discovered the cure to the disease with his ALZ-112 strain. When his project is discontinued, he sneaks from his lab and takes into his home an infant chimpanzee whose mother had been genetically experimented on with ALZ-112. It's readily apparent that the baby had inherited his mother's late surging self-awareness. His intellect expanding in leaps and bounds, the baby chimp, Caesar, comes to regard Will Rodman as his surrogate father and Will's ailing father (an excellent John Lithgow) as family. Caesar wins you over with the care and concern he demonstrates towards Lithgow. Except that true happiness and acceptance continue to elude Caesar in man's world. Caesar knows he is different, not human, not fully ape. In his attempts to fit in and find his rightful place, it's ironic that Caesar is human enough that he eventually decides to play god. If you've seen the trailer, then you can ignore this tardy SPOILER alert. This movie, after all, is a prequel. We know what happens next. Unwittingly, scientist Will Rodman has pretty much effed us.Yay, the downfall of human civilization. RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, in my eyes, is a must-see picture. Unlike most other summer blockbusters, this comes with an intelligent script and a narrative that stays on focus. For what it accomplishes in the realm of CG effects, Weta Digital deserves massive propers. Count Andy Serkis and Alan Rickman as two fantastic artists who probably won't get Oscar nods. Rickman, because he wasn't near enough in the Harry Potter movie. Serkis, because who are we kidding? Maybe if there's a category for best motion capture performer. In Weta Digital and Serkis' hands, Caesar is an utterly compelling character. Caesar is so believably brought to life that, moments into the film, I completely stopped regarding him as a CG fabrication but simply as another character in the movie. It's fascinating to track Caesar's progression from infancy to maturity. The storytelling is so well executed and makes so much sense that you don't question Caesar's choices, up to that moment in which he decides to rise up. And he's so sympathetic that, odds are, you'll be rooting against the humans who go up against him and his band of simians. My most favorite bits take place during his time spent in captivity in the primate sanctuary. It's where we observe him truly become a leader by dint of his will and intellect. By the way, I will mention that this movie isn't necessarily about ape versus man. When Caesar stages his uprising, it's not necessarily directed against humanity. And if you stick around after the closing credits, there's a coda which brings home even more what actually will bring about the decline of man.The apes seem to have a foot already on the threshold even in the acting department. Even more than the relationship between Caesar and Will, we get truly invested in Caesar's interactions with his fellow primates, my two favorites being the caged gorilla and Maurice the circus orangutan who can sign. Note the sudden joy on Caesar's face when he learns that Maurice can communicate with him, that he's not exactly alone. That moment may've been when that revolutionary germ of an idea struck Caesar.It's a bit amusing that the shoddy performances can be laid at humans' feet. Tom Felton is rubbish; his American accent is suspect and is it me or is he just regurgitating lines that he'd already said as Draco Malfoy? Freida Pinto plays a primatologist named Caroline, and other than her one foreshadowing remark - ""I love chimpanzees, but I'm also afraid of them. It's appropriate to be afraid of them."" - she is wasted here. Brian Cox also just twiddles his thumbs as the director of the primate sanctuary, and - here, have a SPOILER alert, because I have to air this out - how much of a fail is it when Cox's character happens to catch Caesar teaching all the other apes to sign and he just goes ""Huh,"" and walks away as if you see that everyday?One mild nitpick I do have is that I'm left wondering where Caesar recruited so many apes to the cause. I don't buy that San Francisco has that many apes. Maybe I'm wrong.But go see this movie. Quit monkeying around.

While there have been a few since then, in general, Hollywood appears to have been languishing in the originality and thought department. Modern films also tend to treat their audiences like morons, or just be very simplistic in nature. Rest assured, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" has all the greatness of a future classic - the viewer won't walk out of THIS one disappointed.""Rise"" tells the story of Caesar, who, for those who have seen the other ""Apes"" films and thus remember this, began the original ape rebellion against humanity. A new drug has been developed by the aptly-named Gen-Sys to cure Alzheimer's disease. Used on the chimpanzees taken specifically for animal testing, it makes them super-intelligent. Caesar, as a baby, is taken in after his mother is killed, kept under the care of Will, whose father has Alzheimer's. The results of this have a domino effect for spoilers:  saying much else about the plot will take away much of the enjoyment factor of the film as surprises wait around each corner.Homages and nods to the original films abound throughout, from the name ""Bright Eyes"" to Charlton Heston making a brief appearance on a TV screen to one of the series' most iconic lines. The film is packed with minute after minute, from beginning to end, of intelligence - there are no unnecessary scenes, little graphic violence, no sensuality, and very little crude language of any sort. Every scene has a purpose, and each one leads off to an ending that is both satisfying and perfect for a sequel hook. The apes, created completely with CGI using Andy Serkis's awesome motion capture work, were incredibly well done - I was particularly impressed with the orangutan! They are believable, living creatures onscreen, although there were some moments where the animation seemed a bit cartoonish, but they were far between. The music was well done, and the performances by all the actors were practically Oscar-worthy by themselves.All in all, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" reminds me very much of old-school, thought-provoking, science fiction epics, updated for the modern day.

Since I loved the original, and its sequels, and saw the remake, I had to see this out of morbid curiosity.As a film on its own, it wasn't that bad. But knowing where it was coming from (or rather, leading up to, since apparently it is a prequel), it is just so wrong. The original was such a fascinating social commentary. This seemed to say nothing. The fact that a propensity for violence comes along with intelligence did seem to be apparent in the movie (one of MANY fascinating concepts explored in the original), although I imagine that is something that will not be explored in depth until the sequel. (God forbid they make another five of them.) Incidentally, were we not supposed to notice that, while they were treating maybe 20 apes, once they decided to revolt, there were what, hundreds of them storming the city?Why does a drug that makes apes super-intelligent make humans bleed to death when our genetic makeup is so similar? That just figures.Maybe there should be a time limit on prequels / sequels. If it has been long enough that all the original actors, writers, directors, etc. are very old or even dead and cannot participate or even give input, I think it is a little late to add to THEIR work.And yes, the special effects were just great.

Running Time: One Hour, 44 mins.Directed by Rupert Wyatt.This is the seventh film in the series.Only Jay Cuputo returns fromPlanet of the Apes [Blu-ray] (2001). This time as ""Alpha"".When I put in the disc, the movie began to play without option menu.Apes are caught in the jungle and some are now in a lab. They are using the experimental drug ALZ-112 on them. During a board meeting, a female ape, Bright Eyes, grabs a hold of a lab assistant by the arm from the holding cell. She gets loose and when she makes it to the boardroom, frightening everyone, it jumps on the table and dies. The ape was the mother of the chimp, Caesar, and apparently was only trying to protect its young.Will Rodman (James Franco) takes the baby chimp from the lab and brings him home with him to save its life. All the chimps were destroyed at the lab. He trains Caesar to learn sign language in English. The chimp jumps around wildly.One day, Will steals some ALZ-112 from the lab and brings it home. He uses one on his father, Charles (John Lithgow), who is aging and becoming ill. The next morning, his father is playing the piano and is active as can be. He wants to take his dad to the lab to be closely monitored. But then, Caesar has found a way to escape. It is foiled by an injury from a neighbor. Will and Charles take him to the Redwoods to climb the trees for recreation.Five years later, Ceasar still enjoys climbing the trees, but he gets testy. He understands English well. His IQ has doubled.You will have to watch the rest of the movie to find out what happens next.An extra scene appears during the end credits.Also in the cast: Andy Serkis as ""Caesar"".

As a child, I loved all of the original films, and I even ""went Ape for a day"" when movie theaters showed all 5 original Apes films back-to-back in one day back in the mid-1970s. I'm also a fan of the Tim Burton ""Planet of the Apes"" film (which is far more faithful to the source novel than the others). So it was with a sense of trepidation that I viewed this latest ""re-imagining."" As it turns out, my fears were for naught. This film, which pretty much reconceptualizes ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"" (the 4th film in the original franchise), is a smart, exciting, and surprisingly sophisticated take on how humanity could engineer its own demise at the hands of another species. James Franco is solid in the lead as a researcher with a strong sense of ethics and a passion to develop a cure for Alzheimer's, a disease that plagues his father, played by the always brilliant John Lithgow. The real star of this film, however, is Andy Serkis, who gives life to Caesar, the chimpanzee who is torn between his love for humanity and his duty to his species--and whose performance is surely worthy of an Oscar nomination.

And a movie needs more than ideas in order to touch us. It needs emotion. ""Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes"" has none of it. I was left cold. Never did i care about any of the characters who were devoided of all depths. They were unidimensional and walking cliches. Their actions and their dialogues served only one purpose: to make the story go forward. I was only curious about how this all came to be, this ruling of the Earth by the apes. A scientist blinded by his father's illness tests a new discovery on apes. The animals become intelligent and the new discovery kills almost everybody on the planet, thus enabling the apes to rule it. The film could have lasted 20 minutes and that would have been more exciting. There is a reason why there's been a lot of movies about these talking apes but never one explaining how it all started: it's not that interesting. Not for two hours. And you can talk all you want about the quality of the special effects but i never bought the character of Ceasar in the first place. He always looked fake to me. Always. And how am i supose to care for the hero when i know ultimately that his experiment will fail and cause the end of civilization? At one point in the film, we get a glimpse of astronauts going to Mars and even getting lost in space. That was even more interresting than the story of the apes itself! I'm guessing without being an expert about this franchise that a possible sequel would involve these astronauts coming back to Earth and being up for one gigantic surprise! Now that's the movie i want to see. That's the movie they should have done.

Rodman, looking for a cure for his father's rapidly progressing alzheimer's disease, decides to pocket a drug that works wonders on the ailments of chimpanzees and takes it home and try it on his father.  That same night he finds himself caught in a moral quandary as a baby chimp named with a mother who was executed by the security guards at the lab is about to be put down.  Nicknamed &#34;bright eyes', Rodman elects reluctantly to take him home.The drug does wonders for his father and Caesar provides some excitement and companionship in his life.  Rodman slowly discovers that Caesar is no ordinary chimp.  Possessed of a surplus of executive functioning that far surpasses the average human being, Caesar becomes the joy of his life and his grandfather's.Unfortunately, though, reality has to set in at a certain point.  A female veterinarian reminds him that Caesar will soon grow into a huge, powerful animal, no matter how novel he is at the moment.  Undeterred by her warning but prompted by Caesar to take her our to dinner, reality clashes with fantasy as Caesar's understandable reaction to a man abusing his confused grandfather prompts his incarceration in the chimp lap Rodman works at.Caesar here realizes that he is neither ape or nor human.  He does not fit because he cannot; he is possessed of greater intelligence than his primate companions, and is not violent.  Mistreated by one particularly unsavory member of the staff, he learns what humanity is capable of and makes it his goal to spread the miracle drug around the chimp compound.  It works, and soon he is on a crusade to make apes the number one species on the planet.This movie is not a fanciful or idealized work of fiction.  Caesar's journey from misfit to alpha ape has all the hallmarks of the human experience, with something greater.

1415652,AXOO7BPM22BDO,B004LWZW4M,"John Green ""Darkwriter""","[10, 15]","*cue up the James Brown guitar riffs*Rise of the Planet of the Apes is the latest reboot of the classic franchise, erasing the god-awful, best forgotten shlock Tim Burton forced upon us back in the nineties. The movie stars James Franco, John Lithgow, Frieda Pinto, Brian Cox, David Oyewelo and Tom Felton.  Screenwriters Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver take the seeds of the original PotA franchise and nurture it along a more organic and logical path, which under the guidance of director Rupert Wyatt could ultimately end up as something truly special.  Unlike Birth of the Planet of the Apes, which was tacked-on to round out the storyline, this one's an origin story from the jump.Will Rodman (Franco) is working on a cure for Alzheimer's Disease, testing his serum on chimpanzees, spurred by his father's (Lithgow) own illness.  Rodman's serum not only repairs brain cells as hoped, but improves upon undamaged ones by enhancing cognitive abilities in the chimps.  A tragic incident leads to the cancellation of the project and the animals being put down, but not before one of the test subjects has given birth.  Rodman takes the newborn chimp home, where he discovers the mother has passed her genetic enhancements along to her offspring.  Now named Caesar, he displays amazing skills and development as he matures, but their idyll is shattered when Caesar commits an act of violence against a neighbor and is taken away by Animal Services.  Being locked away and surrounded by his fellow simians for the first time proves to be a crisis moment for Caesar, one that will ultimately change the course of human history.Where to begin?  Firstly this is a great script, taking the franchise in directions it should've already gone.  The story feels and flows naturally, without relying upon cheesy gimmicks and laziness like time travel to resolve plot issues.  Classic lines and references from the original movie are dropped in both as homages and plot threads for the sequels (What? A space shuttle mission goes awry and both the ship and the crew went missing, you say?  Hmm...).  You should stick around as the credits roll for a minute to check out a slight teaser setting up the sequel's storyline, though from seeing the movie you'd already know what it is.  My only real complaint is the two most iconic lines from the original classic are used, but not very effectively.  The first one you can barely hear over the noise being made and the second was clearly forced into the scene it was used in, but it's Caesar's reaction to it that saves it (and that's two big hints for you).  It's been remarked elsewhere that the previews make Caesar look like a seething ball of simian rage- which isn't the case- and I have to agree.  This is the beginning of a saga- Caesar's journey from alienation into self-awareness that leads into accepting his role as a leader of his species.  A lot for a sci-fi flick, but that's why it works.The CGI is stellar.  Even though it's painfully obvious you're watching motion capture effects it works great, but more for the gorillas than the chimps.  Andy Serkis of Lord of the Rings fame supplies the motion capture for Caesar and the movements are flawlessly smooth, yet another installment in his already excellent body of work.  The acting is solid; James Franco is starting to grow on me and it's always good to see Brian Cox and John Lithgow.  Cox doesn't have all that much to do but Lithgow's good.  I also liked the music; Patrick Doyle is one of the all-timers of movie scoring and in the quieter moments the strings and drums supply that extra emotional impact like they should.  Looking forward to checking out the cd.Rise of the Planet of the Apes is more than you'd expect from even a modern day sci-fi flick.  It's an origin story worthy of a legendary franchise, one that everyone except DC Comics seems to be able to pull off lately by completely investing the audience in the characters and the outcome (yeah, I'm still angry about Green Lantern!). Those expecting a film similar to Birth of the Planet of the Apes, climaxing with burning cities and apes grinding humans down into savagery will be disappointed, but you shouldn't be because this one is much more satisfying and enjoyable.  And there's so much more to come.  Once again Amazon needs a 10-star rating system- though it's not quite a 5-star movie, what the heck.

1415655,A10EICDA6FL5VK,B004LWZW4M,Johnny B. Quick,"[0, 1]","Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes as far as i'm concerned is not part of the actual movie franchise. In my mind, this movie just floats on it's own beside the original 5 movie series. It's loosely based on Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes and shares some similarity but Conquest is loads better than this fake excuse for a new P.O.T.A. movie.In 2011, some knucklehead decided to make another POTA movie. As is expected, it's LOADED with references to the original 1968 movie, which is why I can't take this film seriously as a 6th installment. A new movie in the series would NOT steal lines like &#34;It's a mad house&#34; or &#34;Take your stinking paws off me you d#$@ dirty ape!&#34;. Also the name Bright Eyes is stolen from the original as well. The main ape, Caesar, is obviously not the Caesar from the 70s movies.This movie was obviously made by a fan of the originals and instead of actual plot advancement, it's something completely new and loaded with references. While I admit the movie is okay, it's nothing like the previous ones. First off, instead of actors wearing make up the apes appear to be CGI animated. Now being a life long fan of the series, I think this is an insult to the scary-ish make up.Basically, it's just a movie with POTA references and &#34;Planet Of The Apes&#34; added to the title to boost box office results. Long time fans of the franchise may feel let down, but the plot is okay and it's a good film.

1415656,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B004LWZW4M,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[3, 5]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***At heart, every permutation of the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise has been a searing denouncement of humanity and its numerous vices, especially basic stupidity. However, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (hereafter ""Rise"")catapults human idiocy to near-stratospheric levels. Roger Ebert writes in his ""Rise"" review, ""..the movie has its pleasures, although human intelligence is not one of them."" The simian ascension will be a cakewalk. Consider the examples of human stupidity throughout the movie:1. Gen-Sys, the corporation for which the human protagonist Will Rodman (James Franco) works as a pharmaceutical scientist, boasts appalling security and ethical lapses. Of course, the first transgression involves Caesar's chimpanzee mother, Bright Eyes, who has received an infusion of the mind-enhancing drug, AZ-112.Not only does Gen-Sys lack the facilities to avert her subsequent rampage of destruction, it isn't even aware that she gave birth to Caesar and that her maternal protective instincts triggered her rage.2. Will's well-intentioned but ill-advised benevolence compels him to save the infant Caesar from his mother's fate. He decides to raise Caesar at home like a human child. Bad move. Introducing a potentially wild and destructive beast into a suburban neighborhood, including a chimpanzee, even a gifted one like Caesar is asking for trouble. Remember the story of the woman whose face was mutilated by a neighbor's ""pet"" chimpanzee and who required years of reconstructive surgery? Inevitably, Caesar intervenes between Will's Alzheimers-afflicted father Charles Rodman (John Lithgow) and an irate neighbor to protect the former, injures the latter, and is condemned to live at a brutal ape sanctuary in San Francisco.3. Will's love interest, primatologist Caroline Aranha (Freida Pinto) could have provided valuable insights into chimpanzee behavior, intellect, and motivations, and perhaps could have helped avert the climactic ""ape escape"". But instead of acting like Jane Goodall, Caroline merely makes vague pronouncements about how dangerous ""cute"" chimps really are and how we really shouldn't mess with them, and with genetic science in general. She turns out to be distracting eye candy.4. Again, good-intentioned but ethically-challenged Will absconds with some of the AZ-112 formula from his security- challenged company to inject into his father to re-enhance his cognitive abilities. It works, but only temporarily.5. Meanwhile, the imprisoned Caesar has to endure yet another shabbily maintained and guarded facility, an ape enclosure managed by two louts, the clueless proprietor John Landon (Brian Cox) and his son, abusive animal wrangler Dodge Landon (Tom Felton), plus a third individual.6. Why are there seemingly only three people managing a vast wildlife preserve containing (improbably) hundreds of chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas? Even without his AZ-enhanced genius, Caesar, I think, would not have had too much difficulty escaping from that minimum-security dump?7. Will manages to synthesize a more permanent, powerful version of AZ-112 (AZ-113, naturally) and attempts to test it on another chimpanzee. Lax security strikes again, the ape writhes on the table, a side-effect virus spreads to one of the handlers present (who has lost his sterilizing mask), and the guy later goes out into public without any decontamination procedures to bleed, sneeze, and spread the virus. Just great.8. Clever Caesar escapes, finds his way back to Will's house, obtains some AZ-113, which Will has again appropriated from his sieve of a company, and uses it to ""brain-boost"" his fellow simian inmates, and engineers a jail break.9. Foolishly, the vicious, taser-wielding Dodge allows Caesar to electrocute him with water from a hose.10. Roughly two hundred escaped apes, led by Caesar, romp through San Francisco towards escape over the Golden Gate Bridge. A few cops on horseback with machine guns (and horrible aim) and a couple of helicopters is the best defense the city can muster? Where's the freaking National Guard? No wonder the apes have a relatively easy time making it to the Muir redwoods sanctuary.11. In the movie postscript, the AZ-113 virus (which humans are susceptible to but to which apes are immune) is spread by an airline pilot and becomes an epidemic.12. Thanks, Will. Your good intentions have paved a road to a hell of tort and criminal liability, not to mention the probable extinction of the human race and the subsequent ape ascendancy. At least the dinosaurs had the (arguable) excuse of an asteroid for their superseding by the mammals. And dinosaurs are supposed to be dumb?And yet, despite this relentless parade of dumbness, I really did enjoy the movie. The simian protagonist Caesar (motion-capture animated by Andy Serkis) is mainly responsible. His resourceful intellect, his ""Frankenstein monster"" plight, his sufferings, his clemency and his organization of an eventual worldwide revolution is well-paced and gripping. The movie's creators want you to be in his corner and you are. If that involves stacking the deck against humans, well so be it. Humans have had their day. Let the apes have a crack at it. In the next sequels, let's see how they do.P.S. During the movie, an expedition to Mars is lost in space. It is called Icarus. How apt. In mythology, Icarus flew too close to the sun on wax wings, had them melt, and fell to earth. If and when the Icarus crew falls back to earth, what bizarre reception can they expect?",4,"""Apes Stupid."" No, Maurice. Humans Stupid.

Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[2, 3]","""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" isn't a bad movie, it just isn't a very good or original one.Plenty of stock characters.  In fact, ALL of the human characters in this movie are stock characters.  If you've seen a fair number of genre films or techno-thrillers you've already seen this movie before.  ROTPOTA borrows heavily from cliches and tropes we've seen before, which is not in itself inexcusable.  But it doesn't do anything that original with them either.I read and heard a lot of reviews that said this film was better than it was expected to be and actually pretty good.  Well either those reviews were cherry-picked or the reviewers themselves are babes in the woods and don't know enough about contemporary cinema history to know a copycat scene when they see one.At the risk of making a bad pun, this film's major drawback is that it apes other, better films (and some lesser ones too).The film runs about 2 hours but after the first 80 minutes I thought three hours had gone by.  It drags in the first two acts.The apes escape their enclosures and run amok in the third act through a Hollywood version of San Francisco where there are seemingly only a handful of citizens and maybe 20 cops, not to mention the monkeys get around that unfamiliar-to-them town quicker and faster than a seasoned tour guide can with a map and a teleporter.

(The story is a lot deeper, but I want to keep the summary short.) Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a visually-stunning and epic film.The story in this film is engaging and immersive; the story can often be touching, sad, and even brutal. The relationship between Will and Cesar was great, and felt authentic, despite one character being computer. On that point, the visual effects are amazing in this film; the visuals are crisp, and the animations/movements are smooth, and the facial expressions were extremely detailed. The entire story was entertaining, keeping a SciFi vibe throughout, and ending with an epic, jaw-dropping action sequence. My only slight issue was the actual ending; Cesar and Will have a final confrontation that felt a bit rushed, or incomplete. (Maybe because of the upcoming sequel?) The film is beautiful, the music was enchanting and epic, and the acting was great from the entire cast.The Blu-Ray version of the film looks absolutely amazing and sounds great; this is a film worth owning on Blu-ray or viewing on HD.

1415666,A1DJMQJ3NY7TV5,B004LWZW4M,Jordan David,"[2, 3]","Apes really are fascinating and, yet, we tend to never appreciated them as much as we should.  To think that we and these animals may be a missing link away from one another is more provoking of thought and discussion than perhaps anything else we could possibly converse about.Despite that, I have yet to see an Ape week make its mark on the Discovery Channel.Apes deserve to have a love letter dedicated to their existence, and Wyatt's unexpected reigniting of an iconic franchise is more than ready to be just that.  More so than its immediate self-conscious predecessor (Burton's take) and even that of Schaffner's '68 original, this is the first attempt to steady the limelight solely on the apes themselves, and rightly so.  Before the unorthodox revolution is over, you will feel that this was the way it was always meant to be.Aided by the powerful masterwork of WETA's motion capture technology, the animals here emit a dizzying mirage that blurs the distinction between man and chimp.  Judged on the basis of self expression and bold emotion being translated to that of something that is computer generated, this is simply unparalleled.It's impressive and surprisingly affecting, as our eyes adjust to seeing the subtle waves of sorrow, anger and fear ebb and flow through Caesar's eyes throughout the film - Caesar being the enchanting chimp protagonist.Indeed, for a film so slickly paced and executed, the foundation upon which it depends is, ultimately, one man:  Andy Serkis.  Not unlike Hanks' towering performance in Zemekis' Cast Away, this film is enveloped by Serkis' stunning work as the savant chimp turned Che revolutionist.Wyatt's methodical direction showcases Caesar's progression into the leader of his people; all the while, Serkis' uncannily strong ability to convey through motion meshes with WETA's digital craftsmanship, and it just...works.  It works beautifully.It's a very fragile, very challenging balancing act that Wyatt handles with the restrained care of a true professional. The film cannot help but feel sluggish and uninspired when Caesar is not present, which is, fortunately, very seldom.True, the rest of the talent deserve their screen time but, ultimately, Lithgowe, Franco, Pinto and Cox are merely cogs designed to keep the Serkis' magnificent circus rolling smoothly.  They all play their parts, but it's impossible to ever forget that they are, indeed, ""parts"" of a far greater ""sum"".Unfortunately - though, perhaps inevitably - other elements of the film are handled with far less class, namely the other actors and a very particular plot point that attempts to crudely paint over any glaring holes and inconsistencies.  You'll know it when you see it.I mean, really...the statistics just don't match up well from a logical perspective when you pit apes up against people, so much that a suspension of disbelief may be out of reach for a less flexible audience.  Just trust me when I say no measure of explanation would be enough to make it seem completely probable.  Take Wyatt's scapegoat, avoid its fallacies, and enjoy the rest of the show.If you can do so, you'll still be able to discern a real degree of intelligence and style which the series seemed to be deserving of all along.  Despite a very earnest tone, it never descends into absurdity, nor does it make the very tempting mistake of expanding beyond the scope of its intentions too quickly.  This is a beginning, through and through; there are fleeting glimpses of a sprawling epic yet to be seen, but Wyatt smartly leaves the glistening grandiosity for the sequels.In the meantime, we're left with a timely ode to the being unjustly repressed - to the chimp who said, ""no"" (quite emphatically, in fact), and the others who nodded in agreement.",4,Rise of the Planet of the Apes,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,3762,"['Apes', 'really', 'are', 'fascinating', 'yet', 'tend', 'never', 'appreciated', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'think', 'animals', 'may', 'be', 'missing', 'link', 'away', 'one', 'more', 'provoking', 'thought', 'discussion', 'perhaps', 'anything', 'else', 'could', 'possibly', 'converse', 'about.Despite', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'Ape', 'week', 'make', 'mark', 'Discovery', 'Channel.Apes', 'deserve', 'have', 'love', 'letter', 'dedicated', 'existence', 'Wyatt', 'unexpected', 'reigniting', 'iconic', 'franchise', 'more', 'ready', 'be', 'just', 'More', 'so', 'immediate', 'self-conscious', 'predecessor', 'Burton', 'take', 'even', 'Schaffner', ""'68"", 'original', 'first', 'attempt', 'steady', 'limelight', 'solely', 'apes', 'rightly', 'so', 'unorthodox', 'revolution', 'over', 'will', 'feel', 'was', 'way', 'was', 'always', 'meant', 'be.Aided', 'powerful', 'masterwork', 'WETA', 'motion', 'capture', 'technology', 'animals', 'here', 'emit', 'dizzying', 'mirage', 'distinction', 'man', 'chimp', 'Judged', 'basis', 'self', 'expression', 'bold', 'emotion', 'being', 'translated', 'something', 'computer', 'generated', 'simply', 'unparalleled.It', 'impressive', 'surprisingly', 'affecting', 'eyes', 'adjust', 'seeing', 'subtle', 'waves', 'sorrow', 'anger', 'fear', 'ebb', 'flow', 'Caesar', 'eyes', 'film', 'Caesar', 'being', 'enchanting', 'chimp', 'protagonist.Indeed', 'film', 'so', 'slickly', 'paced', 'executed', 'foundation', 'ultimately', 'one', 'man', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'Not', 'Hanks', 'towering', 'performance', 'Zemekis', 'Cast', 'Away', 'film', 'enveloped', 'Serkis', 'stunning', 'work', 'savant', 'chimp', 'turned', 'Che', 'revolutionist.Wyatt', 'methodical', 'direction', 'Caesar', 'progression', 'leader', 'people', 'while', 'Serkis', 'uncannily', 'strong', 'ability', 'convey', 'motion', 'meshes', 'WETA', 'digital', 'craftsmanship', 'just', 'beautifully.It', 'very', 'fragile', 'very', 'challenging', 'balancing', 'act', 'Wyatt', 'restrained', 'care', 'true', 'professional', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'sluggish', 'uninspired', 'when', 'Caesar', 'not', 'present', 'fortunately', 'very', 'seldom.True', 'rest', 'talent', 'deserve', 'screen', 'time', 'ultimately', 'Lithgowe', 'Franco', 'Pinto', 'Cox', 'are', 'merely', 'cogs', 'designed', 'keep', 'Serkis', 'magnificent', 'circus', 'rolling', 'smoothly', 'play', 'parts', 'impossible', 'ever', 'forget', 'are', 'indeed', 'parts', 'far', 'greater', 'sum', '.Unfortunately', 'perhaps', 'inevitably', 'other', 'elements', 'film', 'are', 'handled', 'far', 'less', 'class', 'namely', 'other', 'actors', 'very', 'particular', 'plot', 'point', 'crudely', 'paint', 'over', 'glaring', 'holes', 'inconsistencies', ""'ll"", 'know', 'when', 'see', 'it.I', 'mean', 'really', 'statistics', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'well', 'logical', 'perspective', 'when', 'pit', 'up', 'people', 'so', 'much', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'may', 'be', 'reach', 'less', 'flexible', 'audience', 'Just', 'trust', 'when', 'say', 'measure', 'explanation', 'would', 'be', 'enough', 'make', 'seem', 'completely', 'probable', 'Take', 'Wyatt', 'scapegoat', 'avoid', 'fallacies', 'enjoy', 'rest', 'show.If', 'can', 'do', 'so', ""'ll"", 'still', 'be', 'able', 'discern', 'real', 'degree', 'intelligence', 'style', 'series', 'seemed', 'be', 'deserving', 'very', 'earnest', 'tone', 'never', 'absurdity', 'make', 'very', 'tempting', 'mistake', 'expanding', 'scope', 'intentions', 'too', 'quickly', 'beginning', 'are', 'fleeting', 'glimpses', 'sprawling', 'epic', 'yet', 'be', 'seen', 'Wyatt', 'smartly', 'glistening', 'grandiosity', 'sequels.In', 'meantime', ""'re"", 'left', 'timely', 'ode', 'being', 'unjustly', 'repressed', 'chimp', 'who', 'said', 'quite', 'emphatically', 'fact', 'others', 'who', 'nodded', 'agreement']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

Reninger,"[0, 0]","After the disappointing Tim Burton version of Planet of the Apes, my expectations were pretty low for the franchise going anywhere interesting. Along came Rise of the Planet of the Apes two years ago and I couldn't have cared less. Reviews seemed to run fairly positive though mostly they were the ""it's a lot better than I expected"" variety. I'm not sure that really means a movie is any good. So I passed it by until I saw it this year on Blu-Ray.The story follows Dr. Will Rodman (James Franco), a scientist working on a miracle drug that will restore and improve brain function. His motive is revealed fairly early--his father has Alzheimer's Disease and is rapidly deteriorating. Rodman's drug is tested on chimpanzees and seems to be working well. He's about to present his star chimp, Bright Eyes, to the company's board of directors to convince them to approve human trials. Her handlers have problems; she breaks free; she tries to escape. The chase through the building is exciting and ends when she crashes through a wall monitor onto the board table and is shot by security. As you might guess, the drug is not approved for human trials. The CEO orders all the trial monkeys to be put down, including the post-mortem-born son of Bright Eyes. Dr. Rodman can't bring himself to kill the baby chimp. He takes the chimp home and raises him in secret while he restarts his drug research.This all happens in the first five or ten minutes of the film. The movie keeps up the brisk pace as the chimp (named ""Caesar"" by the Shakespeare-loving father) grows stronger and smarter, eventually coming into conflict with the human world which gave him his incredible abilities. As with many science fiction films, some bits of it seem a little too improbable (like the crash through the monitor onto the board room table or the number of simians living in San Francisco) but the movie moves so fast and delivers its images so well that I found it easy to go along for the ride.On the other hand, the movie sympathizes almost exclusively with the apes. Caesar is definitely the star and the hero. He is smart but misunderstood; loyal but over-protective; loved but under-appreciated. He and the other apes are abused and downtrodden, so their rising up against their captors makes them look more like freedom fighters than a menace to us humans. Caesar is unwilling to kill humans deliberately and stops a group of apes from beating a person to death. He has more compassion than most of the humans have for the monkeys or for each other.It will be interesting to see if future films continue this trend, seeing the apes as the good guys and the humans as bad guys. The theme of apes being better off without humans has run through all the movies, as has a cynical attitude toward humans and their behavior. It was never quite this cynical before.",4,Great addition to the franchise,1374278400,"07 20, 2013",2013,2844,"['disappointing', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'version', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'expectations', 'were', 'pretty', 'low', 'franchise', 'going', 'anywhere', 'interesting', 'came', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'cared', 'less', 'Reviews', 'seemed', 'run', 'fairly', 'positive', 'mostly', 'were', 'lot', 'better', 'expected', 'variety', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'really', 'movie', 'good', 'passed', 'saw', 'year', 'Blu-Ray.The', 'story', 'Dr.', 'Will', 'Rodman', 'James', 'Franco', 'scientist', 'working', 'miracle', 'drug', 'will', 'restore', 'improve', 'brain', 'function', 'motive', 'revealed', 'fairly', 'early', 'father', 'Alzheimer', 'Disease', 'rapidly', 'deteriorating', 'Rodman', 'drug', 'tested', 'chimpanzees', 'be', 'working', 'well', 'present', 'star', 'chimp', 'Bright', 'Eyes', 'company', 'board', 'directors', 'convince', 'approve', 'human', 'trials', 'handlers', 'have', 'problems', 'free', 'escape', 'chase', 'building', 'exciting', 'ends', 'when', 'wall', 'monitor', 'board', 'table', 'shot', 'security', 'might', 'guess', 'drug', 'not', 'approved', 'human', 'trials', 'CEO', 'orders', 'trial', 'monkeys', 'be', 'put', 'down', 'including', 'post-mortem-born', 'son', 'Bright', 'Eyes', 'Dr.', 'Rodman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'kill', 'baby', 'chimp', 'chimp', 'home', 'secret', 'drug', 'happens', 'first', 'five', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'movie', 'up', 'brisk', 'pace', 'chimp', 'named', 'Caesar', 'Shakespeare-loving', 'father', 'stronger', 'smarter', 'eventually', 'coming', 'conflict', 'human', 'world', 'gave', 'incredible', 'abilities', 'many', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'bits', 'seem', 'little', 'too', 'improbable', 'crash', 'monitor', 'board', 'room', 'table', 'number', 'simians', 'living', 'San', 'Francisco', 'movie', 'so', 'fast', 'images', 'so', 'well', 'found', 'easy', 'go', 'along', 'ride.On', 'other', 'hand', 'movie', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'apes', 'Caesar', 'definitely', 'star', 'hero', 'smart', 'misunderstood', 'loyal', 'over-protective', 'loved', 'under-appreciated', 'other', 'apes', 'are', 'abused', 'downtrodden', 'rising', 'up', 'captors', 'look', 'more', 'freedom', 'fighters', 'menace', 'humans', 'Caesar', 'unwilling', 'kill', 'humans', 'deliberately', 'group', 'apes', 'beating', 'person', 'death', 'more', 'compassion', 'most', 'humans', 'have', 'monkeys', 'other.It', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'future', 'films', 'continue', 'trend', 'seeing', 'apes', 'good', 'guys', 'humans', 'bad', 'guys', 'theme', 'apes', 'being', 'better', 'humans', 'run', 'movies', 'cynical', 'attitude', 'humans', 'behavior', 'was', 'never', 'quite', 'cynical', 'before']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

Something happens and the monkey goes crazy.  It tares apart the offices and starts to attack them.  They have no choice but to kill the ape and all the others that they are doing the tests on.  The monkey that went crazy may leave something behind that carries the advantage that the new medicine gave him.  The scientist takes the monkey home for a short time at first, until he can find a place to keep it from being killed.  Years go by and the monkey has grown.  Through out the movie you see the monkey starts wondering where it came from and it all it is thought of is an animal.  Eventually, the monkey may go somewhere else to live and decides that it is time to free himself and the others.There you go, that is the movie.  You really feel the emotions of the monkey or all of the monkeys.  They did a good job of showing you that some wanted peace and freedom, while others wanted power and control.  The monkeys actually seem to have personalities.  You will be surprised by the fact that you feel like you know them and understand what they want and why they are angry.  It is like they are people.  Very well done in that regard.  The problems that I had with the movie are these.  All the main action in the movie.  Be it the monkeys attacking or escaping, happens in the last 20 or 30 minutes.  The first main part of the movie is all about how the problems started and what happens from them.  I still thought the movie was a lot of fun and worth seeing.  But this is one of those movies that I could watch once and it could and probably would have been a smarter choice to see it at home.If you think about it, it is a good thing that they did not make a movie that was all apes killing people.  They took the time to build up to what would happen.  Another thing that kind of bothered me was this.  For anything that the monkeys did or would do.  The things that you know would have happened to them did not.  I do not want to give anything away.  It was just a weak, strange ending.  The movie was slow, fast and action packed, then back to slow.  If you are wanted to see 100% fast paced action, this may not be for you.  But, my mom, step brother and I did enjoy it.  So it was good for that.  This is not a movie I could ever see myself buying.  Once was enough for me. It was a good movie with a little less of this and that than I thought there would be.",3,Good in different ways than I was expecting.,1313539200,"08 17, 2011",2011,3076,"['****', 'May', 'be', 'spoilers', 'Only', 'little', 'things', 'will', 'not', 'put', 'anything', 'big', 'important', '****This', 'was', 'neat', 'movie', 'either', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'originals', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'movie', 'scientist', 'who', 'trying', 'find', 'cure', 'Alzheimer', 'Which', 'disease', 'father', 'cure', 'out', 'Monkeys', 'see', 'what', 'much', 'smarter', 'ability', 'do', 'things', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'group', 'giving', 'money', 'research', 'hear', 'what', 'needs', 'will', 'show', 'how', 'medicine', 'showing', 'what', 'test', 'monkey', 'can', 'do', 'Something', 'happens', 'monkey', 'crazy', 'apart', 'offices', 'attack', 'have', 'choice', 'kill', 'ape', 'others', 'are', 'doing', 'tests', 'monkey', 'went', 'crazy', 'may', 'leave', 'something', 'advantage', 'new', 'medicine', 'gave', 'scientist', 'monkey', 'home', 'short', 'time', 'first', 'can', 'find', 'place', 'keep', 'being', 'killed', 'Years', 'go', 'monkey', 'grown', 'movie', 'see', 'monkey', 'wondering', 'where', 'came', 'thought', 'animal', 'Eventually', 'monkey', 'may', 'go', 'somewhere', 'else', 'live', 'time', 'free', 'others.There', 'go', 'movie', 'really', 'feel', 'emotions', 'monkey', 'monkeys', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'wanted', 'peace', 'freedom', 'others', 'wanted', 'power', 'control', 'monkeys', 'actually', 'seem', 'have', 'personalities', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'fact', 'feel', 'know', 'understand', 'what', 'want', 'why', 'are', 'angry', 'are', 'people', 'Very', 'well', 'done', 'regard', 'problems', 'had', 'movie', 'are', 'main', 'action', 'movie', 'Be', 'monkeys', 'attacking', 'escaping', 'last', '20', '30', 'minutes', 'first', 'main', 'part', 'movie', 'how', 'problems', 'started', 'what', 'still', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'worth', 'seeing', 'one', 'movies', 'could', 'watch', 'once', 'could', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'smarter', 'choice', 'see', 'home.If', 'think', 'good', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'movie', 'was', 'apes', 'killing', 'people', 'took', 'time', 'build', 'up', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'thing', 'kind', 'bothered', 'was', 'anything', 'monkeys', 'did', 'would', 'do', 'things', 'know', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'was', 'just', 'weak', 'strange', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'slow', 'fast', 'action', 'packed', 'then', 'back', 'slow', 'are', 'wanted', 'see', '100', '%', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'mom', 'step', 'brother', 'did', 'enjoy', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'movie', 'could', 'ever', 'see', 'buying', 'Once', 'was', 'enough', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'little', 'less', 'thought', 'would', 'be']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" will convince you this is the planet of the apes!In ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" James Franco plays Will Rodman, a scientist trying to find a cure for Alzheimers, for the very personal reason of curing his aging father Charles Rodman (John Lithgow). One of the chimpanzees, Caesar (Andy Serkis) is exposed to a genetically enhanced drug that expands his intelligence to human proportions, and he's raised by Franco and Lithgow. In the act of protecting the elder Rodman, Caesar is taken into custody by animal control facility that specializes in apes. In being abused by the system and the keepers Caesar comes to feel abandoned by Franco, and he starts to assert his dominance over the other apes until he effects an escape to get more of the intelligence expanding formula which he then exposes the rest of his simian inmates to.""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is able to suspend your disbelief and as events unfold on the screen lead you to believe the rise of the planet of the apes could happen. In ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" the stars are the apes and the CGI, and for once this isn't a bad rap on the special effects, the CGI really makes the apes appear as individuals, gives them more mobility and believability than either trained apes or people in ape suits could. The facial expressions are a good mix of quasi-human and just simian enough for an audience to empathize with the characters while still seeing the essentially as apes.One moment that could have totally ruined the movie was the inclusion of Charlton Heston's iconic line in ""Planet of the Apes"" ""get your paws off me, you damned dirty ape!"" It almost comes off as a clumsy, cheesy usage, but the filmmakers immediately gave it a twist that redeems and makes the moment memorable unto itself. They didn't try for a twist ending that was the hallmark of the 1968 original but was contrived and doomed the 2001 TimBurton/Mark Wahlberg version.Any version of Planet of the Apes that convinces you this is the planet of the apes, is a movie that gets it right, and ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" gets it right.The DVD includes the bonus features of deleted scenes, a featurette ""Mythology of the Apes,"" and behind the scenes look ""The Genius of Andy Serkis.""",5,This Is The Planet of the Apes!,1325289600,"12 31, 2011",2011,2615,"['Usually', 'remakes', 'prequels', 'sequels', 'reboots', 'formerly', 'successful', 'TV', 'show', 'movie', 'try', 'repeat', 'formula', 'original', 'rework', 'idea', 'so', 'badly', 'contorted', 'contrived', 'such', '2001', 'Tim', 'Burton/Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'version', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'probably', 'set', 'back', 'plans', 'future', 'movies', 'decade', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'will', 'convince', 'planet', 'apes', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'James', 'Franco', 'plays', 'Will', 'Rodman', 'scientist', 'trying', 'find', 'cure', 'Alzheimers', 'very', 'personal', 'reason', 'curing', 'aging', 'father', 'Charles', 'Rodman', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'One', 'chimpanzees', 'Caesar', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'exposed', 'genetically', 'enhanced', 'drug', 'intelligence', 'human', 'proportions', 'raised', 'Franco', 'Lithgow', 'act', 'protecting', 'elder', 'Rodman', 'Caesar', 'taken', 'custody', 'animal', 'control', 'facility', 'apes', 'being', 'abused', 'system', 'keepers', 'Caesar', 'feel', 'abandoned', 'Franco', 'assert', 'dominance', 'other', 'apes', 'effects', 'escape', 'get', 'more', 'intelligence', 'expanding', 'formula', 'then', 'rest', 'simian', 'inmates', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'able', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'events', 'unfold', 'screen', 'lead', 'believe', 'rise', 'planet', 'apes', 'could', 'happen', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'stars', 'are', 'apes', 'CGI', 'once', ""n't"", 'bad', 'rap', 'special', 'effects', 'CGI', 'really', 'apes', 'appear', 'individuals', 'more', 'mobility', 'believability', 'trained', 'apes', 'people', 'ape', 'suits', 'could', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'good', 'mix', 'quasi-human', 'just', 'simian', 'enough', 'audience', 'empathize', 'characters', 'still', 'seeing', 'essentially', 'apes.One', 'moment', 'could', 'have', 'totally', 'ruined', 'movie', 'was', 'inclusion', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'iconic', 'line', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'get', 'paws', 'damned', 'dirty', 'ape', 'almost', 'off', 'clumsy', 'cheesy', 'usage', 'filmmakers', 'immediately', 'gave', 'twist', 'moment', 'memorable', 'unto', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'twist', 'ending', 'was', 'hallmark', '1968', 'original', 'was', 'contrived', 'doomed', '2001', 'TimBurton/Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'version', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'planet', 'apes', 'movie', 'right', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'Mythology', 'Apes', 'scenes', 'look', 'Genius', 'Andy', 'Serkis']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

Rise of the Planet of the Apes took that route instead of the Science Fiction direction that the Apes films normally take on.The main ape is Caesar and he rises to greatness and has the most fleshed out character arc among all the actors.  Yes, Caesar is played by an actual actor with the digital effects layered over him.  The performance is so great you can't tell which is the actor and which is the digital effects.The film could be a political statement about the suppressed rising above the others and taking over. The Apes have done just that and at a much quicker pace breaking out of the cages and putting the humans in there where they belong.James Franco is the lead actor in this and does as good as a job as he can with what he's given to work with.  The script keeps the human actors in the foreground while we focus more on the Ape that the James Franco character takes home and nurtures to power.His father is played by John Lithgow who is battling Alzheimer's and pretty much serves just that purpose and no other.  Tom Felton plays the mean ape keeper that harasses the chimpanzee's in captivation which is never a good idea. Freida Pinto who was in Woody Allen's ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" played beautiful in that and she plays beautiful in this as James Franco's girlfriend.  You first suspect that maybe she understands what's going on with the Apes intelligence and will offer insight to the Franco character, but instead she turns out to be an observing bystander just like the rest of us.This movie was more serious than the average entertaining blockbuster.

That's because they were all transparently CGI'd.  Second of all, this movie was a mish-mash of horrible writing.  For example, we're asked to believe that a drug can increase the intelligence of apes to human level.  OK, that's part of the movie.  But then this super-intelligent ape decides to bite off the finger of his neighbor as a method of solving conflict.  And then acts bewildered about why he's being taken away.  Then there's a lot of confusion about what being ""smart"" means.  For example, exposure to the drug apparently lets monkeys suddenly learn sign language or talk even if they never knew how to before.  Magic!  For some reason, monkeys who have never seen a gun before know that it will shoot bullets at them.  Oddly, when humans were faced with guns they had never seen before, they were terrified by them and didn't understand what was happening ...but a monkey knows!  Wheee!  Don't worry, the wild ride of stupidity is just beginning.  At the end of the movie, the monkeys escape to their paradise: the redwood forests of California!  Only problem is there's a reason there are no monkeys in the redwood forests of California.  It's called, uh, NO FOOD FOR THEM.

1415689,A2BDJOIXPR2AYU,B004LWZW4M,King of Controversy,"[1, 1]","Spoilers Below. . .Rise of the Planet of the apes is a loving prequel to the earlier Planet of the Apes series. It's not what you expect of a 'blockbuster' movie. There's some action (very effectively done) but the film is not driven by action. For the most part, this film somehow avoids the racial allusions made in the earlier literary and celluloid versions of Planet of the Apes. It's a great film none-the-less. Be sure and stay till the very end of the film!It's a perfect prequel. On a television playing in the background, you hear about man's 'first mission to mars' launching. Later in the film you realize these must be the three astronauts who come back to 'earth' in the first Planet of the Apes film. It's a subtle allusion. It doesn't fully make sense till the end of the film - wonderfully done. It did bother me a little, because I've never seen the very beginning of the first movie. Even seeing it 3 times on television perhaps (the first time during the 1970's) the earliest I remember tuning is was with the original astronauts crashed in the water wondering what year it is - as if they had traveled in time - and they also did not know they were back on earth. It was only a small thing. It made for one tiny loose-end as far as I was concerned in a very well done film. The way the Apes take over makes much more sense going by the story told in this film, plus it plays into the fears we have in this day and age. The film stuck to it's strengths. It's not as if the film has great insights into 'human' nature, or as if it is about the development of Caeser's character, but it sticks to Caeser's story.There is a huge problem in the film, however, and so I deduct one star at least. At the beginning of the film the young protagonist desperately wants to continue experimenting on a new drug that raises the intelligence of monkeys. His corporate sponsor's say no - in a show of amazing stupidity (for all we know a violent reaction Is the intelligent response to being a fated lab animal). Later in the movie these same corporate sponsor's want to continue experimenting, no matter what, and the young scientist doesn't agree and even quits his job rather than continue experimenting. Without greater explanation (and it would have taken quite a lot) the turnaround (and both scenes) just seemed like very stupid passages in an otherwise great film. I suspect the film was reverse engineered. The young scientist, well, he's the star, so he has to be a good guy. So he provides a warning of sorts to make him a good guy. Caesar is a protagonist too, so he's a good 'guy' also. Perhaps he's a good guy because he's educated and has good parents. It doesn't hurt that he happens to be a main character in the film. I do feel this is a great film, anyway.",4,Very well done.,1346803200,"09 5, 2012",2012,2781,"['Spoilers', 'Below', '.Rise', 'Planet', 'apes', 'loving', 'prequel', 'earlier', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'series', 'not', 'what', 'expect', ""'blockbuster"", 'movie', 'action', 'very', 'effectively', 'done', 'film', 'not', 'driven', 'action', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'somehow', 'racial', 'allusions', 'made', 'earlier', 'literary', 'celluloid', 'versions', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'great', 'film', 'none-the-less', 'Be', 'sure', 'stay', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'perfect', 'prequel', 'television', 'playing', 'background', 'hear', 'man', ""'first"", 'mission', 'mars', 'launching', 'Later', 'film', 'realize', 'must', 'be', 'three', 'astronauts', 'who', 'come', 'back', ""'earth"", 'first', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'film', 'subtle', 'allusion', ""n't"", 'fully', 'make', 'sense', 'end', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'did', 'bother', 'little', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'very', 'beginning', 'first', 'movie', 'Even', 'seeing', '3', 'times', 'television', 'perhaps', 'first', 'time', '1970', 'earliest', 'remember', 'tuning', 'was', 'original', 'astronauts', 'crashed', 'water', 'wondering', 'what', 'year', 'had', 'traveled', 'time', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'were', 'back', 'earth', 'was', 'only', 'small', 'thing', 'made', 'one', 'tiny', 'loose-end', 'as', 'far', 'was', 'concerned', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'way', 'Apes', 'take', 'over', 'much', 'more', 'sense', 'going', 'story', 'told', 'film', 'fears', 'have', 'day', 'age', 'film', 'stuck', 'strengths', 'not', 'film', 'great', 'insights', ""'human"", 'nature', 'development', 'Caeser', 'character', 'Caeser', 'story.There', 'huge', 'problem', 'film', 'however', 'so', 'deduct', 'one', 'star', 'least', 'beginning', 'film', 'young', 'protagonist', 'desperately', 'continue', 'experimenting', 'new', 'drug', 'intelligence', 'monkeys', 'corporate', 'sponsor', 'say', 'show', 'amazing', 'stupidity', 'know', 'violent', 'reaction', 'intelligent', 'response', 'being', 'fated', 'lab', 'animal', 'Later', 'movie', 'same', 'corporate', 'sponsor', 'want', 'continue', 'experimenting', 'matter', 'what', 'young', 'scientist', ""n't"", 'agree', 'even', 'job', 'rather', 'continue', 'experimenting', 'greater', 'explanation', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'quite', 'lot', 'turnaround', 'scenes', 'just', 'seemed', 'like', 'very', 'stupid', 'passages', 'otherwise', 'great', 'film', 'suspect', 'film', 'was', 'reverse', 'engineered', 'young', 'scientist', 'well', 'star', 'be', 'good', 'guy', 'warning', 'sorts', 'make', 'good', 'guy', 'Caesar', 'protagonist', 'too', 'good', ""'guy"", 'also', 'Perhaps', 'good', 'guy', 'educated', 'good', 'parents', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'be', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'do', 'feel', 'great', 'film', 'anyway']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

1415697,A1QOQHI6TA77CL,B004LWZW4M,Landrik,"[2, 2]","When rating excellent (or terrible) movies, it can be difficult to determine at which point to start.  With Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the same may be true in some respects.  However, with regards to stand out traits ""Rise"" stands out as being believable before all else.  The way that the planet is turned into a place controlled by super-intelligent apes instead of by mankind falls into the category of something that is entirely possible, particularly if one follows scientific news and progress.  The apes are a far cry from those used in the Tim Burton film, ""Planet of the Apes.""  Another motion-capture suit portrayal by the masterful Andy Serkis (Gollum of the film 'Lord of the Rings' and Kong of the film 'King Kong'), this time blended directly into and shot within the live action sequences blurs the lines of reality and cinematic fiction.Furthermore, each differing type of ape within the movie presents a different personality and a different viewpoint; all expressed in a surreal, but believable manner despite lack of voice acting throughout most of the movie from the apes.  This movie will, at very least, leave one wondering further about the thoughts of apes as they play or throw fits of rage at your nearest zoo.  However, the environmentalist feel of several scenes does not take away from the emotionally driven, thought-provoking experience that this film presents.In the end, I was unsure as to whether I felt more emphatic towards the apes or the humans, as our species biggest struggle began. The movie left me feeling euphorically connected and contented.  I am not ashamed to say that I nearly shed a tear at several points in the movie or that I smiled hugely or even chuckled with joy throughout several parts.  The acting aside from that of Mr. Serkis does nothing to harm the movie and I may go so far as to say that Mr. Franco is becoming a very good actor and developing a definite adaptability to fit the roles he chooses to portray.  Mr. Lithgow and Mrs. Pinto also perform their roles beautifully, providing a dynamic that is difficult to remain untouched by throughout the movie.  I would highly recommend that a person watch this movie BEFORE purchasing because it is one of those that ""there are bound to be those who hate it and those that love it and few in between.""

1415704,A3UJUVPDP4XF3B,B004LWZW4M,"Lesley M. Schultz ""msthoth""","[1, 2]","I had no intention of seeing this film after watching the trailer.  I saw Planet of the Apes with Charlton Heston back in the day.  It was cheesy, wrenching and tragic by turns.  Unforgettable.  But the ones that followed were pretty far-fetched and often ridiculous, so a re-boot of the franchise did not interest me.  Hollywood seems to be doing a lot of that these days.  However, I kept hearing from everyone who saw it (and I mean every single person I talked to who saw it), that it was excellent.  So I went.  It far exceeded even my somewhat raised expectations!  I toiled in the pharmaceutical industry for many years.  I know about the testing of the drugs, the executives in the industry desperately trying to cash in on the drugs as much and as fast as possible before the drugs go off patent-- that was realistic in the film. The animal behavior looked right on point.  I didn't have a problem believing James Franco would test this new drug on his ailing father and not tell anyone, but still be a highly moral and responsible person.  Love makes people do weird things and desperation and love is a volatile combination. Some of the film's aspects tested credulity though.  The bit where the testing of the chimps was done there at the company headquarters was not realistic at all.  Drug companies hate to have to test drugs on animals, especially on chimps, because it's expensive and very bad PR for the companies.  The PETA people would have been all over the facility.  Animal testing and especially chimp testing is often out-sourced to other countries that have less delicate sensibilities about torturing animals in the name of science (also it tends to be cheaper.) Similarly I have questions about why there were so many apes at this San Bruno facility.  Some of them are obviously rescued, like the orangutan (Maurice) and most likely the gorilla (Buck.) Buck has been in a cage so long he doesn't even know what fake grass is.  At least one other chimp had been a pet (Cornelia).  But chimps that have been used in drug testing are sacrificed if they were actually dosed so you wouldn't have any refugees from a drug test program unless they were never used.  Still, Andy Serkis does a splendid job making us believe Ceasar is at least as smart as any of us (and frequently smarter than many members of Congress) and far more human.  It impressed me that the battle scene in San Francisco and on the bridge did not result in a lot of human casualties.  The apes did what they had to do to stop the humans from hurting them and that was all.  Chimps are extremely strong and very fast, far superior to humans physically, and it would be easy to have shot this battle as a blood bath.  But the apes were FAR FAR more restrained than any of the human officials.  And when Ceasar speaks for the first time, thanks to both Tom Felton's effective turn as the nasty young keeper and Andy Serkis' performance as the evolved chimp, it's absolutely shattering.  One can completely understand how the keeper is so shocked he can't move to defend himself and the more humane older keeper is so stunned he can't do anything either.  The whole audience is shocked and stunned too.  It sets the stage very effectively for the apes' escape and the subsequent events on the bridge.  I would disagree with a previous reviewer who said the audience laughed when Ceasar speaks his final words to his former guardian ('Ceasar IS home.')  It's beautiful and touching, that he feels enough love and concern for Will to try to explain to him that he is okay now and Will doesn't need to worry for him.  Although Ceasar has outgrown Will, there's a powerful bond there, and I think that speaks to every audience member who has a cherished animal companion at home.  I'd give this film 4.5 stars if I could.  And I LOVED how the filmmakers included a surprise imbedded in the credits.  If you hurried up and left as soon as the film ended then you missed this lovely surprise bit, and it was worth staying for, maybe a minue or two into the credits.  I'm really looking forward to seeing the BTS parts and deleted scenes when the DVD comes out!!!",4,Far Better Film Than I Expected & Really Enjoyed It!,1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,4147,"['had', 'intention', 'seeing', 'film', 'watching', 'trailer', 'saw', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'back', 'day', 'was', 'cheesy', 'wrenching', 'tragic', 'turns', 'Unforgettable', 'ones', 'followed', 'were', 'pretty', 'far-fetched', 'often', 'ridiculous', 're-boot', 'franchise', 'did', 'not', 'interest', 'Hollywood', 'be', 'doing', 'lot', 'days', 'However', 'kept', 'hearing', 'everyone', 'who', 'saw', 'mean', 'single', 'person', 'talked', 'who', 'saw', 'was', 'excellent', 'went', 'far', 'exceeded', 'even', 'somewhat', 'raised', 'expectations', 'toiled', 'pharmaceutical', 'industry', 'many', 'years', 'know', 'testing', 'drugs', 'executives', 'industry', 'desperately', 'trying', 'cash', 'drugs', 'much', 'as', 'fast', 'possible', 'drugs', 'go', 'off', 'patent', 'was', 'realistic', 'film', 'animal', 'behavior', 'looked', 'right', 'point', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'believing', 'James', 'Franco', 'would', 'test', 'new', 'drug', 'ailing', 'father', 'not', 'tell', 'anyone', 'still', 'be', 'highly', 'moral', 'responsible', 'person', 'Love', 'people', 'do', 'weird', 'things', 'desperation', 'love', 'volatile', 'combination', 'film', 'aspects', 'tested', 'credulity', 'bit', 'where', 'testing', 'chimps', 'was', 'done', 'there', 'company', 'headquarters', 'was', 'not', 'realistic', 'Drug', 'companies', 'hate', 'have', 'test', 'drugs', 'animals', 'especially', 'chimps', 'expensive', 'very', 'bad', 'PR', 'companies', 'PETA', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'facility', 'Animal', 'testing', 'especially', 'chimp', 'testing', 'often', 'out-sourced', 'other', 'countries', 'have', 'less', 'delicate', 'sensibilities', 'torturing', 'animals', 'name', 'science', 'also', 'be', 'cheaper', 'Similarly', 'have', 'questions', 'why', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'apes', 'San', 'Bruno', 'facility', 'are', 'obviously', 'rescued', 'orangutan', 'Maurice', 'most', 'likely', 'gorilla', 'Buck', 'Buck', 'been', 'cage', 'so', 'long', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'fake', 'grass', 'least', 'one', 'other', 'chimp', 'had', 'been', 'pet', 'Cornelia', 'chimps', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'drug', 'testing', 'are', 'sacrificed', 'were', 'actually', 'dosed', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'refugees', 'drug', 'test', 'program', 'were', 'never', 'used', 'Still', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'splendid', 'job', 'making', 'believe', 'Ceasar', 'least', 'as', 'smart', 'frequently', 'smarter', 'many', 'members', 'Congress', 'far', 'more', 'human', 'impressed', 'battle', 'scene', 'San', 'Francisco', 'bridge', 'did', 'not', 'result', 'lot', 'human', 'casualties', 'apes', 'did', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'stop', 'humans', 'hurting', 'was', 'Chimps', 'are', 'extremely', 'strong', 'very', 'fast', 'far', 'superior', 'humans', 'physically', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'have', 'shot', 'battle', 'blood', 'bath', 'apes', 'were', 'FAR', 'FAR', 'more', 'restrained', 'human', 'officials', 'when', 'Ceasar', 'first', 'time', 'thanks', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'effective', 'turn', 'nasty', 'young', 'keeper', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'performance', 'evolved', 'chimp', 'absolutely', 'shattering', 'One', 'can', 'completely', 'understand', 'how', 'keeper', 'so', 'shocked', 'ca', ""n't"", 'move', 'defend', 'more', 'humane', 'older', 'keeper', 'so', 'stunned', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'either', 'whole', 'audience', 'shocked', 'stunned', 'too', 'stage', 'very', 'effectively', 'apes', 'escape', 'subsequent', 'events', 'bridge', 'would', 'disagree', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'audience', 'laughed', 'when', 'Ceasar', 'final', 'words', 'former', 'guardian', 'IS', 'home', 'beautiful', 'touching', 'enough', 'love', 'concern', 'Will', 'try', 'explain', 'okay', 'now', 'Will', ""n't"", 'need', 'worry', 'Ceasar', 'outgrown', 'Will', 'powerful', 'bond', 'there', 'think', 'speaks', 'audience', 'member', 'who', 'cherished', 'animal', 'companion', 'home', ""'d"", 'give', 'film', '4.5', 'stars', 'could', 'LOVED', 'how', 'filmmakers', 'included', 'surprise', 'imbedded', 'credits', 'hurried', 'up', 'left', 'as', 'soon', 'film', 'ended', 'then', 'missed', 'lovely', 'surprise', 'bit', 'was', 'worth', 'staying', 'maybe', 'minue', 'two', 'credits', ""'m"", 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'BTS', 'parts', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'when', 'DVD', 'out']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

We had Footloose, The Thing, Straw Dogs, the end of the Harry Potter series. We had great prequels such as Xmen First Class, the best of the series, and now we have Rise of the Planet of the Apes.I have not seen all the Planet of the Apes series, but I have seen the first one with Charlton Heston, and the fish out of water, topsy turvy, apes rule the planet is hard to emulate and surpass from a storytelling point of view, as is the mythology of the original story, with the enlighened apes having their own spin on the evolution of the planet.With Rise of the Planet of the Apes we have the beginning of the mythology, and shifting the iconography west from the Statue of you know what to the Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco. Every behavior has a positive intention, such as finding a cure for cancer or alzheimers, and making money in the process, yet at the same time exploiting innocent creatures to do so. When these elements get out of control then behaviors can have unintended consequences.For me, the mythology of the birth of Caesar under unusual circumstance, to a mother dosed with performance enhancing drugs parallels the birth of Moses, who would grow up to lead his people out of Egypt (San Francisco) to the promised land (Muir Woods). Human hubris, leads to the fall of humanity and the rise of the Planet of the Apes.Following the purging of the 12, Caesar as a baby, is found not in the rushes but in a cage, and secretly raised by a scientist James Di Franco, and his girlfriend played by Freida Pinto. We know that he has extraordinary abilities, that must be kept under wraps. Nevertheless Caesar has to contend with his own instinctive nature, and acting with the intention to protect gets into serious trouble. Caesar has observing ego, and learns from his mistakes. When we see a recurrence of a similar situation he handles it differently.Living in San Francisco I loved how these scenes played out in familiar locales, such as downtown San Francisco, and Muir Woods with the 150 foot high redwoods, which Caesar climbs, the panoramic views, and I particularly loved the confrontation scenes on the Golden Gate bridge, and how the fog was able to help with battle. I don't normally recommend special effect, except to say that they are outstanding.Andy Serkis, who previously played King Kong, plays Caesar, and movie magic from WETA captures the almost human facial expressions, and makes us empathise with his situation, we can see his thought processes. I loved the prison scenes, and how Caesar rises to become leader, how he contends with the alpha male, his captors, how he organises his fellow inmates. Evolution becomes revolution.Although the original with Charlton Heston is hard to beat, I loved this version. When a franchise runs out of steam, and a story runs out of possibilities, it is perhaps time to go back before the beginning, and start anew, and free of the restrictions of the original story, come up with something fresh and emotionally engaging. They did it with Batman Begins. That franchise was bereft of life.Now it has been done with Planet of the Apes. I would be interested in seeing a sequel, where Caesar perhaps has a love interest, she gets captured, they have a kid, and there is a power struggle within the apes, betrayal, escalation with the humans. The possibilities are endless.I think most people will enjoy this, and I hope you found this helpful.",5,Taking it to the treetops-two opposable thumbs up,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,3485,"['11', 'may', 'go', 'down', 'year', 'remakes', 'reboots', 'sequels', 'had', 'Footloose', 'Thing', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'end', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'had', 'great', 'prequels', 'such', 'Xmen', 'First', 'Class', 'best', 'series', 'now', 'have', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes.I', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'one', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'fish', 'water', 'topsy', 'turvy', 'rule', 'planet', 'hard', 'emulate', 'surpass', 'storytelling', 'point', 'view', 'mythology', 'original', 'story', 'enlighened', 'apes', 'having', 'own', 'spin', 'evolution', 'planet.With', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'have', 'beginning', 'mythology', 'shifting', 'iconography', 'west', 'Statue', 'know', 'what', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Every', 'behavior', 'positive', 'intention', 'such', 'finding', 'cure', 'cancer', 'alzheimers', 'making', 'money', 'process', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'exploiting', 'innocent', 'creatures', 'do', 'so', 'When', 'elements', 'get', 'control', 'then', 'behaviors', 'can', 'have', 'unintended', 'consequences.For', 'mythology', 'birth', 'Caesar', 'unusual', 'circumstance', 'mother', 'dosed', 'performance', 'enhancing', 'drugs', 'birth', 'Moses', 'who', 'would', 'grow', 'up', 'lead', 'people', 'Egypt', 'San', 'Francisco', 'promised', 'land', 'Muir', 'Woods', 'Human', 'hubris', 'fall', 'humanity', 'rise', 'Planet', 'Apes.Following', 'purging', '12', 'Caesar', 'baby', 'found', 'not', 'rushes', 'cage', 'secretly', 'raised', 'scientist', 'James', 'Di', 'Franco', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Freida', 'Pinto', 'know', 'extraordinary', 'abilities', 'must', 'be', 'kept', 'wraps', 'Nevertheless', 'Caesar', 'contend', 'own', 'instinctive', 'nature', 'acting', 'intention', 'protect', 'serious', 'trouble', 'Caesar', 'observing', 'ego', 'mistakes', 'When', 'see', 'recurrence', 'similar', 'situation', 'differently.Living', 'San', 'Francisco', 'loved', 'how', 'scenes', 'played', 'out', 'familiar', 'locales', 'such', 'downtown', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Muir', 'Woods', '150', 'foot', 'high', 'redwoods', 'Caesar', 'climbs', 'panoramic', 'views', 'particularly', 'loved', 'confrontation', 'scenes', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'bridge', 'how', 'fog', 'was', 'able', 'help', 'battle', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'recommend', 'special', 'effect', 'say', 'are', 'outstanding.Andy', 'Serkis', 'who', 'previously', 'played', 'King', 'Kong', 'Caesar', 'movie', 'magic', 'WETA', 'almost', 'human', 'facial', 'expressions', 'empathise', 'situation', 'can', 'see', 'thought', 'loved', 'prison', 'scenes', 'how', 'Caesar', 'become', 'leader', 'how', 'alpha', 'male', 'captors', 'how', 'fellow', 'inmates', 'Evolution', 'original', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'hard', 'beat', 'loved', 'version', 'When', 'franchise', 'steam', 'story', 'possibilities', 'perhaps', 'time', 'go', 'back', 'beginning', 'start', 'anew', 'free', 'restrictions', 'original', 'story', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'fresh', 'emotionally', 'engaging', 'did', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'franchise', 'was', 'bereft', 'life.Now', 'been', 'done', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'seeing', 'sequel', 'where', 'Caesar', 'perhaps', 'love', 'interest', 'captured', 'have', 'kid', 'power', 'struggle', 'apes', 'betrayal', 'escalation', 'humans', 'possibilities', 'are', 'endless.I', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'enjoy', 'hope', 'found', 'helpful']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

1415725,A3IY9HIAMJQ7HL,B004LWZW4M,Marcel Lee,"[0, 0]","The title is awkward, but it serves as the gist of the plot. It's a restart of a franchise that began with Franklin Schaffner's Planet Of The Apes in 1968. Of course, by now, cinematic technology is such that the apes; every one of which is computer-generated using Weta Digital motion capture; look even more alive than they do in real life. The story itself, which revolves around a brain-enhancing retrovirus, isn't quite as believable, but it is thoroughly entertaining.This ""Planet"", by the way, isn't in some far-away galaxy. It's planet Earth. And the story is set during the present time. That means it's a given that these apes; physically stronger and genetically altered to be even more intelligent than humans; are going to take over as the rulers of the world. The suspense lies in how that happens, which begins with chimpanzees being hunted and captured in the Congo jungle and sold to pharmaceutical labs for testing.It's when the lead scientist; a man named Will Rodman; rescues a cute baby from being euthanized by taking it home with him; &agrave; la Gremlins; that things start to get interesting. It lives with him and his father, who's suffering from Alzheimer's; a disease the scientist proposes the experimental retrovirus might develop into a cure for; growing older and getting smarter, until something goes wrong and it has to be sent away to a sanctuary... with other apes.From there, it's an evolution revolution that leads to escape and quite an amazing movie climax. Yes, that final third or fourth is the best part as wild apes unite not necessarily to take over the world at this point but to free themselves from captivity. So they raid public places, causing mass hysteria; the zoos are a primary target; all the while exposing more and more apes to the brain-enhancing retrovirus; a process that itself spreads like a virus.There's an ape-versus-human showdown on The Golden Gate Bridge, where police set-up a barricade in an effort to stop the apes, but the police don't stand a chance. What the humans need, in order to preserve their status as the rulers of the world, is the military. And that, quite literally, means war; an interspecific war of the world. But this is only the prelude. So it's a war you're left very-much anticipating by the end of this science-fiction epic.marcellee.com",5,5 of 5,1363392000,"03 16, 2013",2013,2330,"['title', 'awkward', 'gist', 'plot', 'restart', 'franchise', 'began', 'Franklin', 'Schaffner', 'Planet', 'Apes', '1968', 'course', 'now', 'cinematic', 'technology', 'such', 'apes', 'one', 'computer-generated', 'using', 'Weta', 'Digital', 'motion', 'capture', 'look', 'even', 'more', 'alive', 'do', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'brain-enhancing', 'retrovirus', ""n't"", 'quite', 'believable', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining.This', 'Planet', 'way', ""n't"", 'far-away', 'galaxy', 'planet', 'Earth', 'story', 'set', 'present', 'time', 'given', 'apes', 'physically', 'stronger', 'genetically', 'altered', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'intelligent', 'humans', 'are', 'going', 'take', 'over', 'rulers', 'world', 'suspense', 'how', 'chimpanzees', 'being', 'hunted', 'captured', 'Congo', 'jungle', 'sold', 'pharmaceutical', 'labs', 'testing.It', 'when', 'lead', 'scientist', 'man', 'named', 'Will', 'Rodman', 'cute', 'baby', 'being', 'euthanized', 'taking', 'home', 'agrave', 'Gremlins', 'things', 'start', 'get', 'interesting', 'father', 'who', 'suffering', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'scientist', 'experimental', 'retrovirus', 'might', 'develop', 'cure', 'growing', 'older', 'getting', 'smarter', 'something', 'wrong', 'be', 'sent', 'away', 'sanctuary', 'other', 'apes.From', 'there', 'evolution', 'revolution', 'escape', 'quite', 'amazing', 'movie', 'climax', 'Yes', 'final', 'third', 'fourth', 'best', 'part', 'wild', 'apes', 'not', 'necessarily', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'point', 'free', 'captivity', 'raid', 'public', 'places', 'causing', 'mass', 'hysteria', 'zoos', 'are', 'primary', 'target', 'while', 'exposing', 'more', 'more', 'apes', 'brain-enhancing', 'retrovirus', 'process', 'ape-versus-human', 'showdown', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'where', 'police', 'set-up', 'barricade', 'effort', 'stop', 'apes', 'police', 'do', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', 'What', 'humans', 'need', 'order', 'preserve', 'status', 'rulers', 'world', 'military', 'quite', 'literally', 'war', 'interspecific', 'war', 'world', 'only', 'prelude', 'war', ""'re"", 'left', 'very-much', 'anticipating', 'end', 'science-fiction', 'epic.marcellee.com']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

1415730,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004LWZW4M,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","Growing up in the sixties I was always a fan of the PLANET OF THE APES movies. Not so much the later TV or cartoon series, but the films yes. Not only did it feature some of the best science fiction stories around but also some of the most amazing special effects make up ever seen. The semi-human apes were made plausible by the make up and that gave the movies something to hold on to. So when I heard they were remaking the series I was skeptical to say the least. I shouldn't have been.Rather than begin this film with the landing of a spacecraft we begin in the near future. Will Rodman (James Franco) is a scientist working for a major drug company searching for a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Testing on animals and in particular chimpanzees, he thinks he's found a cure, a drug that has helped the brain recreate cells. This has led to increased mental activity in the apes and shown them to think more. When he goes to demonstrate before the board of directors, his star subject goes mad and attacks everyone from her handlers to the staff at the research center. They are forced to kill her and the project is put on hold.Unknown to Will and her handlers at the time, the ape was merely protecting the baby she gave birth to beforehand. Ordered to destroy all of the test subjects, will secrets this one away and names him Caesar, raising him at home. Caesar is smarter than most apes having had the formula Will developed in his bloodstream via his mother since birth. Will also illegally uses this formula on his father (John Lithgow) who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, with remarkable success.Will and Caesar continue to grow together. Will carries on his experiments and research hoping that the drug he's found will be the answer. Caesar continues to expand his mental abilities and ability to converse via sign language with will and later with Will's girlfriend Caroline (Freida Pinto), a veterinarian. Will takes Caesar on occasional outings to a local national forest but never lets him run free on his own without his being there.The drug Will developed doesn't have long term success though. As Will's father begins to lose his mental abilities several years down the road (and as Caesar has grown), he accidentally wrecks a neighbor's car and while being shoved by him, Caesar escapes the house and attacks the man to defend Lithgow. Animal control is called in and Caesar is locked up that appears fine. But unknown to Will the center is run by men who just want a paycheck and who taunt and torture the monkeys being held.While Will tries to go the legal route and get Caesar back at the same time the drug company is expanding his research and hoping to go public, Caesar becomes resentful of being caged and treated as an animal by his jailers. Using his intelligence and escaping, Caesar goes home and steals several canisters of the now aerosol drug, releasing it among his fellow captive apes. Soon they escape and set out to rectify the treatment they have received at the hands of man.This new take on how the apes evolved replaces the time travel questions raised in the original films but still has several loopholes in logic. But not enough that you can't enjoy the film or marvel at the story being told.Best of all the film features some of the most amazing special effects ever seen. Using motion capture technology you will actually believe you are seeing an ape perform rather than a man in a suit. But there actually IS no man in a suit at all, just computer generated motion captured images on screen. Caesar shows emotions on his face and body language that make you feel for him, care for him. It's an amazing piece of technology that brings not just the film but the character to life. By the end of the film you find yourself rooting for the apes!RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES doesn't just tell a science fiction story. It tells a human story as well, of mistreatment of animals and how humans are tossed aside as well. It takes on the question of animal testing without being preachy or slamming one side or the other as well. But most of all it tells a solid story from beginning to end and entertains in the process. This is not just a movie that you will want to see but you will want to see more than once.

Then people watched it and everyone said it was the surprise hit of the year.When you have only CGI apes, even the promise of Andy Serkis donning the motion capture and James Franco being anything other than Spider-man's back-up kept me from hoping this movie would be decent.Then I watched it on DVD.This movie is a prequel-like movie to the original Planet of the Apes (with Charleton Heston). It sets up the idea of how the apes took over the planet. There are the honorary nods and winks to Heston's epic: ""Get your stinking paws off me..."" and ""It's a mad house!!"" are woven into the movie.

We're bound to get a sequel with a possible re-telling of the original.James Franco does a decent job as a scientist who's on the verge of curing Alzheimer's. His character arc is bound to his father who suffers from the disease. Serkis certainly deserves some kind of award or honorary mention for his bringing a CGI creation to such life. Other characters are simply there to fill the void. Tom Felton (Harry Potter's nemesis, Malfoy) continues his mean streak by abusing the apes in his father's so-called sanctuary.

1415748,A3JAH5WW61N2EK,B004LWZW4M,Michael Laferriere,"[1, 1]","I caught a few minutes of this on TV one night and said that actually looked like it might be good. I usually prefer old classics, ""The African Queen,"" ""Sahara,"" ""The Sand Pebbles"" and such and usually feel that Hollywood needs to actually get some writers and directors to their job and come up with something original. Special effects and CGI will only make you go ""wow"" for so long. So, I wound up ordering Rise of the Planet of the Apes from Amazon a few days later. This modern version of the Planet of the Apes has really made me put those feelings aside especially after seeing the earlier Planet of the Apes movie which did not do the original movies any justice.The director did a good job letting you know what the apes had in mind as they would zoom in on an object and put you in the shoes (if they wore shoes) of the ape. It was also very easy to tell who was the writers wanted to be the bad guy or good guy in this movie. When the apes would show a sign of submission to one other they had a vet from a nearby zoo point this out early which made some scenes later on easier to understand. It was almost like the original movie backwards in some ways, the end of the movie has a closing scene with an ape on a horseback charging humans. What is more important though is an earlier scene in the movie with Caesar putting the final piece in of a Statue of Liberty puzzle.The movie has plenty of surprises including a few scenes that you believed Caesar was going to 'take revenge' on someone but in all actuality Caesar would play the upper hand and really make a 'monkey' out of a former bully or foe. There are also some throwbacks to the original movie as well, lines such as ""take your paws off me you 'darn' dirty ape!"" and the news scenes with the spaceship Icarus is likely a throwback to the original movies as well. Icarus is also a mortal from Greek Mythology who was able to fly on wings made of wax and feathers and was too proud to heed advice about being careful. With this pride he ignored the advice given and flew too close to the sun and the wax melted.Two big plot holes existed regarding the ALZ 113, that I noticed. First, Franklin was infected with the new ALZ 113 virus and never appeared to become smarter. Second, when the apes free the apes at the Zoo, the Zoo apes at that time had no exposure to the virus and would have had average ape intelligence. Wouldnt they have considered these other apes as intruders and defended their turf instead of instantly joining them?My favorite scene in the movie is one that some might have missed. You would have noticed Caesar and Maurice (the Orangutan that Caesar was teaching to sign) together.  Caesar took a stick, showed it to Maurice and broke it. Then he took several sticks held together and showed Maurice that they couldn't be broken when together. This was not Caesar showing Maurice how to make tools or just killing time. I think this was a plan on a strategy that Julius Caesar used in his time of ""divide et impera."" Translated ""divide and Rule."" IE, ""United we stand, divided we fall."" The original Planet of the Apes movies that many of us grew up with usually had hidden lessons as well. This movie obviously does as well and shows us that if we all stick together nothing is impossible. Certainly the apes showed us this by leaving you surprised at the ending. I don't want to ruin it! The ending was such that they have fantastic potential for several sequels.BUY it, watch it, review it!!!!",5,"Hollywood really made up for the 2001 Planet of the Apes Movie, 5 stars!!!",1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,3490,"['caught', 'few', 'minutes', 'TV', 'one', 'night', 'said', 'actually', 'looked', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'usually', 'prefer', 'old', 'classics', 'African', 'Queen', 'Sahara', 'Sand', 'Pebbles', 'such', 'usually', 'feel', 'Hollywood', 'actually', 'get', 'writers', 'directors', 'job', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'original', 'Special', 'effects', 'CGI', 'will', 'only', 'make', 'go', 'wow', 'so', 'long', 'So', 'wound', 'up', 'ordering', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Amazon', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'modern', 'version', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'really', 'made', 'put', 'feelings', 'aside', 'especially', 'seeing', 'earlier', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'original', 'movies', 'justice.The', 'director', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'letting', 'know', 'what', 'apes', 'had', 'mind', 'would', 'zoom', 'object', 'put', 'shoes', 'wore', 'shoes', 'ape', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'easy', 'tell', 'who', 'was', 'writers', 'wanted', 'be', 'bad', 'guy', 'good', 'guy', 'movie', 'When', 'apes', 'would', 'show', 'sign', 'submission', 'one', 'other', 'had', 'vet', 'nearby', 'zoo', 'point', 'out', 'early', 'made', 'scenes', 'later', 'easier', 'understand', 'was', 'almost', 'original', 'movie', 'backwards', 'ways', 'end', 'movie', 'closing', 'scene', 'ape', 'horseback', 'charging', 'humans', 'What', 'more', 'important', 'though', 'earlier', 'scene', 'movie', 'Caesar', 'putting', 'final', 'piece', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'puzzle.The', 'movie', 'plenty', 'surprises', 'including', 'few', 'scenes', 'believed', 'Caesar', 'was', 'going', ""'take"", 'revenge', 'someone', 'actuality', 'Caesar', 'would', 'play', 'upper', 'hand', 'really', 'make', ""'monkey"", 'former', 'bully', 'foe', 'are', 'also', 'throwbacks', 'original', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'lines', 'such', 'take', 'paws', ""'darn"", 'dirty', 'ape', 'news', 'scenes', 'spaceship', 'Icarus', 'likely', 'throwback', 'original', 'movies', 'well', 'Icarus', 'also', 'mortal', 'Greek', 'Mythology', 'who', 'was', 'able', 'fly', 'wings', 'made', 'wax', 'feathers', 'was', 'too', 'proud', 'heed', 'advice', 'being', 'careful', 'pride', 'ignored', 'advice', 'given', 'flew', 'too', 'close', 'sun', 'wax', 'melted.Two', 'big', 'plot', 'holes', 'existed', 'regarding', 'ALZ', '113', 'noticed', 'First', 'Franklin', 'was', 'infected', 'new', 'ALZ', '113', 'virus', 'never', 'appeared', 'become', 'smarter', 'Second', 'when', 'apes', 'free', 'apes', 'Zoo', 'Zoo', 'apes', 'time', 'had', 'exposure', 'virus', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'average', 'ape', 'intelligence', 'have', 'considered', 'other', 'apes', 'intruders', 'defended', 'turf', 'instead', 'instantly', 'joining', 'favorite', 'scene', 'movie', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'missed', 'would', 'have', 'noticed', 'Caesar', 'Maurice', 'Orangutan', 'Caesar', 'was', 'teaching', 'sign', 'together', 'Caesar', 'took', 'stick', 'showed', 'Maurice', 'broke', 'Then', 'took', 'several', 'sticks', 'held', 'together', 'showed', 'Maurice', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'broken', 'when', 'together', 'was', 'not', 'Caesar', 'showing', 'Maurice', 'how', 'make', 'tools', 'just', 'killing', 'time', 'think', 'was', 'plan', 'strategy', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'used', 'time', 'divide', 'et', 'impera', 'Translated', 'divide', 'Rule', 'IE', 'United', 'stand', 'divided', 'fall', 'original', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'movies', 'many', 'grew', 'up', 'usually', 'had', 'hidden', 'lessons', 'well', 'movie', 'obviously', 'as', 'well', 'stick', 'together', 'nothing', 'impossible', 'Certainly', 'apes', 'showed', 'leaving', 'surprised', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'ending', 'was', 'such', 'have', 'fantastic', 'potential', 'several', 'sequels.BUY', 'watch', 'review']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

It is basically a character study of Caesar as he changes in response to a drug being tested on apes, and Andy Serkis's performance coupled with the computer-generated imagess makes this transformation believable and fascinating.  Moreover, the interaction of the characters with Caesar lends realism to his character.This movie was exceptionally well done in many respects, and it was enjoyable to watch.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that some of its premises were a bit difficult to believe.  Caesar sulking and refusing to leave a highly oppressive situation to come home to a loving family was just not believable to me at all, and since I regard evolution as implausible also, the idea that an ape--even with any amount of drugs--could attain that level of intelligence and ability was also not believable.

1415759,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,B004LWZW4M,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[0, 0]","It's a hard act following a classic series of movies from the old days so while I felt the character interactions and special effects were especially well done I found myself lacking in story plotting and overall resonance. So regarding the former two elements it's very spot on as we have a tight relationship between the main human character (James Franco) and the CGI created chimpanzee (voiced by Andy Serkis a la Gollum), Caesar, who will become the founder of an intelligent race of apes that dominate the globe in later years but unless you know of the Planet of the Apes universe (POA) then disregard that last part.John Lithgow is the father of the main character scientist and he's got Alzheimer's which explains why Franco's character is so hell bent on finding a cure. He works at a secretive company that is experimenting on apes to try and find a cure. Of course some of the apes are treated cruelly and disregarded. One mother dies during birth and Franco's character finds himself reluctantly taking care of the baby chimp and then growing emotionally attached to it. Those emotional connections are some of the best parts of this picture as you begin to see the species division arise as Caesar sees his kind as pets/slaves to humanity and gradually rebels. Up until the climax I thought it was plotted very well but the whole fight was poorly delivered. I personally felt that a more powerful counter force would have been sent out to deal with the ape problem at the end but I won't get into big time spoilers. There was also another big question at the end which wasn't answered to my satisfaction either. In fact up until the climax this was like a B plus to A minus film.This film was nominated by the 2012 Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects. For POA fans who know it all this was intended as a prequel to ""The Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"". The screenwriters put several moments into the films that are nods to the old pictures so look for them.The budget for this picture was $93M and it made over $481M at the Box Office (Wiki).STORY/PLOTTING: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; CGI/SPECIAL EFFECTS: A minus to A; ACTION: B minus to B; THEME FOCUSES & DELIVERY: B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: mid May 2012.",4,MY GRADE: B to B plus.,1337299200,"05 18, 2012",2012,2268,"['hard', 'act', 'following', 'classic', 'series', 'movies', 'old', 'days', 'so', 'felt', 'character', 'interactions', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'especially', 'well', 'done', 'found', 'lacking', 'story', 'plotting', 'overall', 'resonance', 'So', 'regarding', 'former', 'two', 'elements', 'very', 'spot', 'have', 'tight', 'relationship', 'main', 'human', 'character', 'James', 'Franco', 'CGI', 'created', 'chimpanzee', 'voiced', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'la', 'Gollum', 'Caesar', 'who', 'will', 'become', 'founder', 'intelligent', 'race', 'apes', 'dominate', 'globe', 'later', 'years', 'know', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'universe', 'POA', 'then', 'last', 'part.John', 'Lithgow', 'father', 'main', 'character', 'scientist', 'got', 'Alzheimer', 'why', 'Franco', 'character', 'so', 'hell', 'bent', 'finding', 'cure', 'secretive', 'company', 'experimenting', 'apes', 'try', 'find', 'cure', 'course', 'apes', 'are', 'treated', 'cruelly', 'disregarded', 'One', 'mother', 'birth', 'Franco', 'character', 'reluctantly', 'taking', 'care', 'baby', 'chimp', 'then', 'growing', 'emotionally', 'attached', 'emotional', 'connections', 'are', 'best', 'parts', 'picture', 'begin', 'see', 'species', 'division', 'arise', 'Caesar', 'kind', 'pets/slaves', 'humanity', 'gradually', 'rebels', 'climax', 'thought', 'was', 'plotted', 'very', 'well', 'whole', 'fight', 'was', 'poorly', 'delivered', 'personally', 'felt', 'more', 'powerful', 'counter', 'force', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sent', 'out', 'deal', 'ape', 'problem', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'big', 'time', 'spoilers', 'was', 'also', 'big', 'question', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'answered', 'satisfaction', 'fact', 'climax', 'was', 'B', 'plus', 'A', 'minus', 'film.This', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', '2012', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Visual', 'Effects', 'POA', 'fans', 'who', 'know', 'was', 'intended', 'prequel', 'Conquest', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'screenwriters', 'put', 'several', 'moments', 'films', 'are', 'nods', 'old', 'pictures', 'so', 'look', 'them.The', 'budget', 'picture', 'was', '93M', 'made', '481M', 'Box', 'Office', 'Wiki', '.STORY/PLOTTING', 'B', 'CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE', 'B', 'A', 'minus', 'CGI/SPECIAL', 'EFFECTS', 'minus', 'A', 'ACTION', 'B', 'minus', 'B', 'THEME', 'FOCUSES', 'DELIVERY', 'B', 'OVERALL', 'GRADE', 'B', 'B', 'WHEN', 'WATCHED', 'mid', 'May', '2012']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes
1415760,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B004LWZW4M,mitchell5954,"[1, 1]","Rise of The Planet of The Apes is the first film in the new rebooted Planet of the Ape franchise.  I am not that into Planet of The Apes.  I had only seen the original before this.  This movie is not as good as the original but it is still a well-made film regardless.  I&#8217;m glad I saw it and am looking forward to the new film coming out next year.The film stars a scientist named Will Rodman (James Franco) trying to develop a cure for Alzheimer&#8217;s because his father Charles (John Lithgow) has it.  He starts by testing his new drug on apes and one of them does very well and is vastly more intelligent.  Will tries to get the board to give him more funding but one of the apes goes out of control and gets killed.  That ape was pregnant with a baby ape which Will adopts and names Caesar.  Caesar inherited the drug from his mom so he becomes much more intelligent as he matures.  However, he causes an accident and has to be put in an ape shelter.  There he gradually befriends the other apes while getting treated horribly by the workers there.  They eventually stage a revolt with Caesar as the leader.The film is well-made.  The acting is good.  I am a fan of James Franco as an actor.  This is not his best performance that I&#8217;ve seen but he does a good job.  The cg looks good in many places.  The story is good and I think it is a decent start to a new franchise.  It is taking what the original setup but doing something different.  Instead of war paving the way for the takeover it is a virus caused by the drug James Franco&#8217;s character invented.  I thought that was a good way to distinguish itself.  I thought the action at the end was fun and well executed, especially the scene on the bridge.This film does have some problems that do not ruin the film but are noteworthy.  Firstly, the CGI of the apes, while very good in many spots, was very noticeable in some spots, especially the cg for Caesar.  While the film is under two hours it feels longer.  The pacing kind of drags in the middle.  Aside from Will and Caesar none of the other characters are that interesting.  They are very one note characters that mostly serve to make us feel bad for Caesar.  Some characters had no business being there like Will&#8217;s girlfriend Freida.  Lastly the film is a bit too heavy-handed.  The film is good but it is not something I would re-watch all the time.  This is due to the fact that the film is sad throughout and it tries a bit too hard to pull on your heart strings.  Again, the bad guys are very one-dimensional characters that are just there to advance the plot.  This suffers from some of the problems Avatar suffered from, though this film is better.Overall, Rise of the Apes was a good start to the new Apes franchise.  The film is a bit heavy-handed, and some of its characters are quite bland.  Despite that the film does have things that keep you invested.  The acting is fine.  James Franco and Andy Serkis as Caesar are good character you come to invest in.  The action scenes at the end are fun to watch.  The story is competent and I like this new angle this film takes on a classic story.  If you like Planet of the Apes then you should check this out and the newest film coming if you like it.",4,Good Start To A New Franchise!,1387497600,"12 20, 2013",2013,3249,"['Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'first', 'film', 'new', 'rebooted', 'Planet', 'Ape', 'franchise', 'am', 'not', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'had', 'only', 'seen', 'original', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'still', 'well-made', 'film', 'regardless', '8217', 'glad', 'saw', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'new', 'film', 'coming', 'out', 'next', 'year.The', 'film', 'scientist', 'named', 'Will', 'Rodman', 'James', 'Franco', 'trying', 'develop', 'cure', 'Alzheimer', '8217', 's', 'father', 'Charles', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'testing', 'new', 'drug', 'apes', 'one', 'very', 'well', 'vastly', 'more', 'intelligent', 'Will', 'tries', 'get', 'board', 'give', 'more', 'funding', 'one', 'apes', 'control', 'killed', 'ape', 'was', 'pregnant', 'baby', 'ape', 'Will', 'adopts', 'names', 'Caesar', 'Caesar', 'inherited', 'drug', 'mom', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'intelligent', 'However', 'accident', 'be', 'put', 'ape', 'shelter', 'gradually', 'other', 'apes', 'getting', 'treated', 'horribly', 'workers', 'there', 'eventually', 'stage', 'revolt', 'Caesar', 'leader.The', 'film', 'well-made', 'acting', 'good', 'am', 'fan', 'James', 'Franco', 'actor', 'not', 'best', 'performance', '8217', 'seen', 'good', 'job', 'cg', 'good', 'many', 'places', 'story', 'good', 'think', 'decent', 'start', 'new', 'franchise', 'taking', 'what', 'original', 'setup', 'doing', 'something', 'different', 'Instead', 'war', 'paving', 'way', 'takeover', 'virus', 'caused', 'drug', 'James', 'Franco', '8217', 'character', 'invented', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'way', 'distinguish', 'thought', 'action', 'end', 'was', 'fun', 'well', 'executed', 'especially', 'scene', 'bridge.This', 'film', 'have', 'problems', 'do', 'not', 'ruin', 'film', 'are', 'noteworthy', 'Firstly', 'CGI', 'apes', 'very', 'good', 'many', 'spots', 'was', 'very', 'noticeable', 'spots', 'especially', 'cg', 'Caesar', 'film', 'two', 'hours', 'longer', 'pacing', 'kind', 'drags', 'middle', 'Aside', 'Will', 'Caesar', 'none', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'are', 'very', 'one', 'note', 'characters', 'mostly', 'serve', 'make', 'feel', 'bad', 'Caesar', 'characters', 'had', 'business', 'being', 'Will', '8217', 'girlfriend', 'Freida', 'Lastly', 'film', 'bit', 'too', 'heavy-handed', 'film', 'good', 'not', 'something', 'would', 're-watch', 'time', 'due', 'fact', 'film', 'sad', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'pull', 'heart', 'strings', 'Again', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'very', 'one-dimensional', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'there', 'advance', 'plot', 'suffers', 'problems', 'Avatar', 'suffered', 'film', 'better.Overall', 'Rise', 'Apes', 'was', 'good', 'start', 'new', 'Apes', 'franchise', 'film', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'characters', 'are', 'quite', 'bland', 'film', 'have', 'things', 'keep', 'invested', 'acting', 'fine', 'James', 'Franco', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'Caesar', 'are', 'good', 'character', 'come', 'invest', 'action', 'scenes', 'end', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'story', 'competent', 'like', 'new', 'angle', 'film', 'classic', 'story', 'like', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'then', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'newest', 'film', 'coming', 'like']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes
1415761,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B004LWZW4M,M. Oleson,"[1, 2]","I've never been a huge fan of the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise, but I remember the first one being pretty good and the 2001 Tim Burton remake so-so.  Given the ""Batman"" and James Bond recent reboots however, this prequel had my interest.  Eschewing actual animals, director Rupert Wyatt and the producers elect to go with motion capture that was so effective in ""Avatar"".  It works!  In fact the star of this cerebral action film isn't the standard human cast headed by James Franco, but Andy Serkis as the primate Caesar who grows to become the leader of the ape rebellion.  I'm not sure if the movie would have held up without the chimps, gorillas and orangutans showing human emotion.  This is likely only workable with current technology.  Frowns, joy, sorrow and fear can only be successfully portrayed with expressions and facial contortions.In this story which predates the original by 2000 years or so, a scientist named Will Rodman (Franco) working in a large ""big phama"" company, develops a drug that may have implications of curing Alzheimer's disease.  Will's father (John Lithgow) is in advanced stages.  After a chimp gets violent at the plant, the project is shut down, but Will rescues a newborn chimp and names him Caesar (Serkis).  Through a series of accidental and purposeful mistreatment, Caesar gains mental powers to complement his animal strength and dexterity.  Freida Pinto co-stars as Will's girlfriend but the 2 interact so distantly, you would think they are brother and sister.  This relationship is never developed.  I guess Pinto was hired to be just eye candy.  The film ends with the induced virus strengthening the apes, but alas becomes fatal to the world population.  Thus Earth becomes the planet of the apes and is their jumping off point to rise to species superiority.",4,"Best of all the ""Apes""",1324252800,"12 19, 2011",2011,1811,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'franchise', 'remember', 'first', 'one', 'being', 'pretty', 'good', '2001', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'remake', 'so-so', 'Given', 'Batman', 'James', 'Bond', 'recent', 'reboots', 'however', 'prequel', 'had', 'interest', 'Eschewing', 'actual', 'animals', 'director', 'Rupert', 'Wyatt', 'producers', 'elect', 'go', 'motion', 'capture', 'was', 'so', 'effective', 'Avatar', 'fact', 'star', 'cerebral', 'action', 'film', ""n't"", 'standard', 'human', 'cast', 'headed', 'James', 'Franco', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'primate', 'Caesar', 'who', 'become', 'leader', 'ape', 'rebellion', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'held', 'up', 'chimps', 'gorillas', 'orangutans', 'showing', 'human', 'emotion', 'likely', 'only', 'workable', 'current', 'technology', 'Frowns', 'joy', 'sorrow', 'fear', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'successfully', 'portrayed', 'expressions', 'facial', 'contortions.In', 'story', 'original', '2000', 'years', 'so', 'scientist', 'named', 'Will', 'Rodman', 'Franco', 'working', 'large', 'big', 'phama', 'company', 'drug', 'may', 'have', 'implications', 'curing', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'Will', 'father', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'advanced', 'stages', 'chimp', 'violent', 'plant', 'project', 'shut', 'down', 'Will', 'newborn', 'chimp', 'names', 'Caesar', 'Serkis', 'series', 'accidental', 'purposeful', 'mistreatment', 'Caesar', 'gains', 'mental', 'powers', 'complement', 'animal', 'strength', 'dexterity', 'Freida', 'Pinto', 'co-stars', 'Will', 'girlfriend', '2', 'interact', 'so', 'distantly', 'would', 'think', 'are', 'brother', 'sister', 'relationship', 'never', 'developed', 'guess', 'Pinto', 'was', 'hired', 'be', 'just', 'eye', 'candy', 'film', 'induced', 'virus', 'strengthening', 'apes', 'becomes', 'fatal', 'world', 'population', 'Thus', 'Earth', 'planet', 'apes', 'jumping', 'off', 'point', 'rise', 'species', 'superiority']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes
1415762,A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y,B004LWZW4M,Monkdude,"[2, 3]","Now this is a summer movie that has it all. A smart story, great CGI and a likeable cast. The first 90 minutes is an engaging build up with more depth that your average blockbuster, followed by plenty of chaotic action to close out the final half hour. I've seen the first two of the old Planet of the Apes films and the remake by Tim Burton. Other than the originality of the first 1968 film, this prequel, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is my favorite.James Franco plays a scientist who stumbles upon a cure for Alzheimer's by increasing brain function. He tests it out on a chimpanzee who gives birth to her genetically enhanced offspring named Caesar, thus creating the future leader of the apes. Andy Serkis, who famously played Gollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and Kong in Peter Jackson's King Kong, shows you why he is the best in the business at bringing motion capture characters to life. All of the movements and facial expressions of Caesar are his. In fact, Serkis ends up being more of the lead actor than Franco. It was also nice to see John Lithgow on the big screen, especially after his phenomenal work on Dexter, even though his role is rather small.The other stars of the show are the incredible SFX by WETA. Most of the ape scenes provide the illusion that you are watching real animals rather than something made in a computer. A few parts don't quite look as convincing, but as a whole I can see this receiving an Oscar nomination for visual effects.Other than some moments you have to suspend disbelief as far as the story is concerned, Rise of the Planet of the Apes will not insult your intelligence, or in my case lack thereof, and it provides a nice launching point for the lengthy series that has come before it.",4,From throwing poop to throwing spears,1312588800,"08 6, 2011",2011,1747,"['Now', 'summer', 'movie', 'A', 'smart', 'story', 'great', 'CGI', 'likeable', 'cast', 'first', '90', 'minutes', 'engaging', 'build', 'up', 'more', 'depth', 'average', 'blockbuster', 'followed', 'plenty', 'chaotic', 'action', 'close', 'out', 'final', 'half', 'hour', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', 'two', 'old', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'films', 'remake', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Other', 'originality', 'first', '1968', 'film', 'prequel', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'favorite.James', 'Franco', 'scientist', 'who', 'cure', 'Alzheimer', 'increasing', 'brain', 'function', 'out', 'chimpanzee', 'who', 'birth', 'genetically', 'enhanced', 'offspring', 'named', 'Caesar', 'thus', 'creating', 'future', 'leader', 'apes', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'who', 'famously', 'played', 'Gollum', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'Kong', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'King', 'Kong', 'why', 'best', 'business', 'bringing', 'motion', 'capture', 'characters', 'life', 'movements', 'facial', 'expressions', 'Caesar', 'are', 'fact', 'Serkis', 'up', 'being', 'more', 'lead', 'actor', 'Franco', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'big', 'screen', 'especially', 'phenomenal', 'work', 'Dexter', 'even', 'role', 'rather', 'small.The', 'other', 'stars', 'show', 'are', 'incredible', 'SFX', 'WETA', 'Most', 'ape', 'scenes', 'provide', 'illusion', 'are', 'watching', 'real', 'animals', 'rather', 'something', 'made', 'computer', 'few', 'parts', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'look', 'convincing', 'whole', 'can', 'see', 'receiving', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'visual', 'effects.Other', 'moments', 'have', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'as', 'far', 'story', 'concerned', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'will', 'not', 'insult', 'intelligence', 'case', 'lack', 'thereof', 'nice', 'launching', 'point', 'lengthy', 'series', 'come']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

Spitzer ""mas017""","[0, 0]","I give this telling of the Planet of the Apes saga a 4 stars mostly because of the long hours and hard work that must have been spent creating the CGI apes.The CGI is impressive in an artistic way, but not so much in a realistic way.I don't know if it was intentional, or simply the limitations of computer animation at this time in history ,,, but at no time do you feel the ape characters are real.They are always un-realistic looking ........... but yet, I still find the animation impressive in an artistic, expressive way.The over all movie is a bit less than 4 stars.The story has some logic flaws in many places.The acting from many of the human actors seems stiff and ""phoned in"".The editing is a bit choppy.Nothing really wrong .... but just something that gives the movie a bit of a 'cut and paste"" feel as opposed to a smooth compelling story.My biggest complaint ?The overall mood of the movie was not serious enough.I always felt Planet of the Apes universe had a darker mood and commentary about human society and social issues.This film seems to be kind of comical, light hearted and goofy all the way thru, even during what are intended to be heavy and serious scenes.It feels ""too Hollywood formula"" and bouncy and light-hearted.It is good family entertainment and certainly demonstrated long hours of hard work, but it feels like the producers relied on the CGI to carry the film and simply glossed over the other parts of the film.I am happy to see it made good $$$$ as I always like to see hard work get rewarded.We enjoyed the movie, but it did not impart a lasting impression and will not be added to our DVD collection.I doubt I would ever watch it again.I know this review seems a little ""Jeckyl and Hyde"".I guess I respect the hard work that went into making this movie, and I WANTED to be more excited about it...............  but when all is said and done, when the movie was over there was no ""WOW"" factor or desire to order a copy for our own DVD collection.But certainly worth a watch",4,"Entertaining, but probably not destined to become a classic",1332633600,"03 25, 2012",2012,2014,"['give', 'telling', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'saga', '4', 'stars', 'mostly', 'long', 'hours', 'hard', 'work', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'creating', 'CGI', 'apes.The', 'CGI', 'impressive', 'artistic', 'way', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'realistic', 'way.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'intentional', 'simply', 'limitations', 'computer', 'animation', 'time', 'history', 'time', 'do', 'feel', 'ape', 'characters', 'are', 'real.They', 'are', 'always', 'un-realistic', 'looking', '..', 'yet', 'still', 'find', 'animation', 'impressive', 'artistic', 'expressive', 'way.The', 'movie', 'bit', 'less', '4', 'stars.The', 'story', 'logic', 'flaws', 'many', 'places.The', 'acting', 'many', 'human', 'actors', 'stiff', 'phoned', '.The', 'editing', 'bit', 'choppy.Nothing', 'really', 'wrong', 'just', 'something', 'movie', 'bit', ""'cut"", 'paste', 'feel', 'opposed', 'smooth', 'compelling', 'story.My', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'overall', 'mood', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'serious', 'enough.I', 'always', 'felt', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'universe', 'had', 'darker', 'mood', 'commentary', 'human', 'society', 'social', 'issues.This', 'film', 'be', 'kind', 'comical', 'light', 'hearted', 'goofy', 'way', 'thru', 'even', 'what', 'are', 'intended', 'be', 'heavy', 'serious', 'scenes.It', 'feels', 'too', 'Hollywood', 'formula', 'bouncy', 'light-hearted.It', 'good', 'family', 'entertainment', 'certainly', 'demonstrated', 'long', 'hours', 'hard', 'work', 'producers', 'relied', 'CGI', 'carry', 'film', 'simply', 'glossed', 'other', 'parts', 'film.I', 'am', 'happy', 'see', 'made', 'good', 'always', 'like', 'see', 'hard', 'work', 'get', 'rewarded.We', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'impart', 'lasting', 'impression', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'added', 'DVD', 'collection.I', 'doubt', 'would', 'ever', 'watch', 'again.I', 'know', 'review', 'little', 'Jeckyl', 'Hyde', '.I', 'guess', 'respect', 'hard', 'work', 'went', 'making', 'movie', 'WANTED', 'be', 'more', 'excited', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'WOW', 'factor', 'desire', 'order', 'copy', 'own', 'DVD', 'collection.But', 'certainly', 'watch']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

We also get a perspective from animals that are in many ways very similar to us but are currently being used as lab animals to further our medical research. It is in many ways a revenge movie only with captive animals against their human oppressors. I definitely was siding with the apes by midway through the film. Nature is complex and this movie shows that many of the ways we try to tame it may come back to bite us in the rear.There are some questions I had such as how the treatment that made the apes more intelligent was able to be passed down through the generations through natural breeding if the gene therapy is applied through genetic engineering (which alters somatic cells, not germinal) but when one is watching sci-fi films one should expect to suspend some disbelief or at least be as charitable as one's skeptical attitude will allow.I felt the animated ape voiced by a real life actor did a great job. His character's actions and facial expressions were a good mixture of both chimp-like but also very human like gestures. Pulling that off must have been a big technical and acting challenge. There weren't any obviously annoying dialogues and super cheesy plot devices (always a plus nowadays) and all the actors I felt did a good job. Sometimes the special effects felt a little fake but overall it was well done.Movies have always reflected the worries and scares of the times. Sometimes, in hindsight, the attention are not warranted, but I think the worries about biotechnology and the way we are treating animals in labs and nature as a whole are worthy of more attention and concern and I'm glad this movie tackled those issues in a non preachy and entertaining way.",4,A rather entertaining movie,1314662400,"08 30, 2011",2011,1844,"['Nothing', 'really', 'great', 'deep', 'here', 'fact', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'dangers', 'biotechnology', 'also', 'get', 'perspective', 'animals', 'are', 'many', 'ways', 'very', 'similar', 'are', 'currently', 'being', 'used', 'lab', 'animals', 'further', 'medical', 'research', 'many', 'ways', 'revenge', 'movie', 'only', 'captive', 'animals', 'human', 'oppressors', 'definitely', 'was', 'siding', 'apes', 'midway', 'film', 'Nature', 'complex', 'movie', 'many', 'ways', 'try', 'tame', 'may', 'come', 'back', 'bite', 'rear.There', 'are', 'questions', 'had', 'such', 'how', 'treatment', 'made', 'apes', 'more', 'intelligent', 'was', 'able', 'be', 'passed', 'down', 'generations', 'natural', 'breeding', 'gene', 'therapy', 'applied', 'genetic', 'engineering', 'somatic', 'cells', 'not', 'germinal', 'when', 'one', 'watching', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'one', 'should', 'expect', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'least', 'be', 'as', 'charitable', 'one', 'skeptical', 'attitude', 'will', 'allow.I', 'felt', 'animated', 'ape', 'voiced', 'real', 'life', 'actor', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'character', 'actions', 'facial', 'expressions', 'were', 'good', 'mixture', 'chimp-like', 'also', 'very', 'human', 'gestures', 'Pulling', 'off', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'technical', 'acting', 'challenge', 'were', ""n't"", 'obviously', 'annoying', 'dialogues', 'super', 'cheesy', 'plot', 'devices', 'always', 'plus', 'nowadays', 'actors', 'felt', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Sometimes', 'special', 'effects', 'felt', 'little', 'fake', 'overall', 'was', 'well', 'done.Movies', 'have', 'always', 'reflected', 'worries', 'scares', 'times', 'Sometimes', 'hindsight', 'attention', 'are', 'not', 'warranted', 'think', 'worries', 'biotechnology', 'way', 'are', 'treating', 'animals', 'labs', 'nature', 'whole', 'are', 'worthy', 'more', 'attention', 'concern', ""'m"", 'glad', 'movie', 'tackled', 'issues', 'non', 'preachy', 'entertaining', 'way']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

On the one hand, the people behaved nonsensically, with James Franco demanding that his drug be rushed into human testing on the basis of success in one test animal, to his boss ordering all the test animals killed when one acts aggressively, to the manager in their business responsible for the chimps who never notices that one of them is pregnant and gives birth and has a baby in her cage until after she dies. Are you kidding me? Then, later in the film, James Franco and his boss change views, with the boss insisting on immediate expansion of testing and Franco saying no, for no reason the audience will even know.Then there are the chimps, who are animated at a level only modestly better than 1981 video game ""donkey kong"". At no time do we feel any tension over their fate; they are too clearly fake. When a group of them become super-smart thanks to the application of James Franco's wonder-drug, and escape a bizarre government sanctuary for chimps, they multiply at least 20x on their way to free other chimps at Franco's lab and the zoo (the chimps from which become magically super-smart themselves, though they never were even exposed to the wonder-drug).Twice in the film, one of the wonder-chimps speaks in English. Presumably the brain-enhancing drug also makes his vocal cords more human in their structure. This goes undiscussed on screen.There is one excellent, Speilberg-esque scene of suburbanites marveling as leaves rain down on their cars, shaken loose by the horde of apes traveling through the treetops above. We get various cute callouts to the original films (the launch and loss of the spacecraft from which the returning astronauts will come, Charlton Heston on TV, ""get your hands off me, your d*mn dirty apes,"" etc.) This is sort of cute but can't address the structural problems with the film.",2,a disappointing film,1340582400,"06 25, 2012",2012,1918,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'more', 'disappointment', 'film', 'people', 'apes', 'one', 'hand', 'people', 'behaved', 'nonsensically', 'James', 'Franco', 'demanding', 'drug', 'be', 'rushed', 'human', 'testing', 'basis', 'success', 'one', 'test', 'animal', 'boss', 'ordering', 'test', 'animals', 'killed', 'when', 'one', 'aggressively', 'manager', 'business', 'responsible', 'chimps', 'who', 'never', 'one', 'pregnant', 'birth', 'baby', 'cage', 'Are', 'kidding', 'Then', 'later', 'film', 'James', 'Franco', 'boss', 'change', 'views', 'boss', 'insisting', 'immediate', 'expansion', 'testing', 'Franco', 'saying', 'reason', 'audience', 'will', 'even', 'know.Then', 'are', 'chimps', 'who', 'are', 'animated', 'level', 'only', 'modestly', 'better', '1981', 'video', 'game', 'donkey', 'kong', 'time', 'do', 'feel', 'tension', 'fate', 'are', 'too', 'clearly', 'fake', 'When', 'group', 'become', 'super-smart', 'thanks', 'application', 'James', 'Franco', 'wonder-drug', 'escape', 'bizarre', 'government', 'sanctuary', 'chimps', 'multiply', 'least', '20x', 'way', 'free', 'other', 'chimps', 'Franco', 'lab', 'zoo', 'chimps', 'become', 'magically', 'super-smart', 'never', 'were', 'even', 'exposed', 'wonder-drug', '.Twice', 'film', 'one', 'wonder-chimps', 'speaks', 'English', 'Presumably', 'brain-enhancing', 'drug', 'also', 'vocal', 'cords', 'more', 'human', 'structure', 'undiscussed', 'one', 'excellent', 'Speilberg-esque', 'scene', 'suburbanites', 'marveling', 'leaves', 'rain', 'down', 'cars', 'shaken', 'loose', 'horde', 'apes', 'traveling', 'treetops', 'get', 'various', 'cute', 'callouts', 'original', 'films', 'launch', 'loss', 'spacecraft', 'returning', 'astronauts', 'will', 'come', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'TV', 'get', 'hands', 'd*mn', 'dirty', 'apes', 'etc', 'sort', 'cute', 'ca', ""n't"", 'address', 'structural', 'problems', 'film']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

And (even though I personally liked it) it failed miserably. Fast forward a decade and once again an attempt is made, this time with the opposite result.Rise is a movie about family and of one scientists attempt to keep his together. Will Rodman (James Franko) has been working for a long time on a cure for Alzheimer's by means of a retrovirus. They test this ""cure"" on chimps and find that not only does it repair damage but it greatly increases intelligence. When Will is due to present his successful chimp subject ""Bright Eyes"" to the board she suddenly goes wild, attacks the chimp wrangler and causes chaos until she is shot and killed. In the aftermath Will is ordered (by his boss Steven Jacobs) to destroy the remaining ape subjects and take his cure ""Back to formula"" (an obvious Spider-Men reference). Will and the wrangler Robert Franklin discover the reason brighteyes went crazy, she had been pregnant and given birth to a baby chimp. Will spirits the newborn away and takes him home. Once there will begins to notice that the baby is smart. like his mother he has the Cure inside him but unlike his mother he was born with it. ""Caesar"" as he has come to be known grows up and starts acting like a typical Tween. But when he sneaks out of the house to play with other kids he is attacked by Will's nextdoor neighbor Hunsiker. Will brings Caesar to the zoo (in a cool scene in which every ape in the place is silent until they see him). Will meets Primate Physician Caroline and the two hit it off.

Fans of the originals may pick up things that newcomers may not. Little things that are said and character traits of the apes that I believe will lead into and become characters from the original.One thing I thought about after I watched it was that if you took away the CGI apes, you don't have a movie. All the apes are fake throughout the entire film. The human actors are not near as entertaining as the apes and they lacked solid acting.

1415791,AXYJ9QJYS3S78,B004LWZW4M,pastapadre,"[2, 3]","Rise of the Planet of the Apes may be the first film of the summer that has surpassed reasonable expectations and delivered a completely compelling story along with amazing special effects and credible suspense. Make no mistake this is anything but a cheap capitalization on a known franchise but instead works exceptionally well as a standalone movie that will leave audiences hoping that the journey can continue beyond the satisfying conclusion.The story begins with a geneticist (James Franco) who is working on a cure for Alzheimer's disease with testing being done on chimps. A breakthrough is made when one in particular shows signs of greatly increased intelligence however due to an incident the test subjects are eliminated except for a baby that Franco's character secretly takes home and raises with his Alzheimer's suffering father. They name him Caesar and the relationships built are genuine and provide that connection so critical in order to increase the impact of events later in the film.The drug that was given to the apes in the lab was passed on to Caesar through his mom. Eventually he outgrows the domestic situation and his protective instincts take over which results in him being forced into a sanctuary and amongst other apes - a foreign situation considering he had only lived with humans and never had any interaction with his own species. After a rough start there he begins the revolution by uniting the apes and leading an escape.Caesar is very much the lead character in the movie, and though Franco's character provides an emotional attachment and the presence that ties the developments together and lead Caesar down his path, it's quite possible that not a single human character's name will be remembered. They take a backseat to Caesar and the apes who are fascinating to watch not just in their actions but in the way they can deliver their emotions, thoughts, and communicate without needing dialogue to do so.That is a huge credit to Andy Serkis who once again comes through with amazing performances that were captured and then animated over. There is no understating how fantastic the special effects for the apes are and how important that is - it would be much more difficult to sympathize with their plights otherwise. It's always appreciated when a film can place the audience in a position where they have to question what side they are actually rooting for because all those involved can justify their actions in some form or fashion.Though it works completely on its own there are also some great callbacks to the Planet of the Apes of the past. One in particular is somewhat distracting but is followed by probably the most powerful moment in the film so it can't be faulted for that too much. Fans of the prior installments will appreciate all of those instances otherwise.The movie is most surprising in its sincerity as it provides a compelling character study of Caesar. Beyond that it could leave audiences questioning the morality of testing and the general perception of other species as humans sit atop of the food chain - thankfully it never preaches on any of those subjects however. By challenging the audience and leaving them invested in the outcome, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is the most satisfying film this summer has had to offer.",4,One of the best of summer 2011,1325462400,"01 2, 2012",2012,3304,"['Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'may', 'be', 'first', 'film', 'summer', 'surpassed', 'reasonable', 'expectations', 'delivered', 'completely', 'compelling', 'story', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'credible', 'suspense', 'Make', 'mistake', 'anything', 'cheap', 'capitalization', 'known', 'franchise', 'instead', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'standalone', 'movie', 'will', 'leave', 'audiences', 'hoping', 'journey', 'can', 'continue', 'satisfying', 'conclusion.The', 'story', 'geneticist', 'James', 'Franco', 'who', 'working', 'cure', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'testing', 'being', 'done', 'chimps', 'breakthrough', 'made', 'when', 'one', 'particular', 'shows', 'signs', 'greatly', 'increased', 'intelligence', 'however', 'due', 'incident', 'test', 'subjects', 'are', 'eliminated', 'baby', 'Franco', 'character', 'secretly', 'home', 'Alzheimer', 'suffering', 'father', 'name', 'Caesar', 'relationships', 'built', 'are', 'genuine', 'provide', 'connection', 'so', 'critical', 'order', 'increase', 'impact', 'events', 'later', 'film.The', 'drug', 'was', 'given', 'apes', 'lab', 'was', 'passed', 'Caesar', 'mom', 'Eventually', 'domestic', 'situation', 'protective', 'instincts', 'take', 'over', 'results', 'being', 'forced', 'sanctuary', 'other', 'apes', 'foreign', 'situation', 'considering', 'had', 'only', 'lived', 'humans', 'never', 'had', 'interaction', 'own', 'species', 'rough', 'start', 'revolution', 'uniting', 'apes', 'leading', 'escape.Caesar', 'very', 'much', 'lead', 'character', 'movie', 'Franco', 'character', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'presence', 'developments', 'together', 'lead', 'Caesar', 'path', 'quite', 'possible', 'not', 'single', 'human', 'character', 'name', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'take', 'backseat', 'Caesar', 'apes', 'who', 'are', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'not', 'just', 'actions', 'way', 'can', 'deliver', 'emotions', 'thoughts', 'communicate', 'needing', 'dialogue', 'do', 'so.That', 'huge', 'credit', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'who', 'once', 'again', 'amazing', 'performances', 'were', 'captured', 'then', 'animated', 'over', 'understating', 'how', 'fantastic', 'special', 'effects', 'apes', 'are', 'how', 'important', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'sympathize', 'plights', 'otherwise', 'always', 'appreciated', 'when', 'film', 'can', 'place', 'audience', 'position', 'where', 'have', 'question', 'what', 'side', 'are', 'actually', 'rooting', 'involved', 'can', 'justify', 'actions', 'form', 'completely', 'own', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'callbacks', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'past', 'One', 'particular', 'somewhat', 'distracting', 'followed', 'probably', 'most', 'powerful', 'moment', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'faulted', 'too', 'much', 'Fans', 'prior', 'installments', 'will', 'appreciate', 'instances', 'otherwise.The', 'movie', 'most', 'surprising', 'sincerity', 'compelling', 'character', 'study', 'Caesar', 'Beyond', 'could', 'leave', 'audiences', 'questioning', 'morality', 'testing', 'general', 'perception', 'other', 'species', 'humans', 'sit', 'atop', 'food', 'chain', 'thankfully', 'never', 'subjects', 'however', 'challenging', 'audience', 'leaving', 'invested', 'outcome', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'most', 'satisfying', 'film', 'summer', 'had', 'offer']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

1415794,A2QDSG599HSWVA,B004LWZW4M,Patrick Wilkinson,"[2, 3]","Disaster movies are a dime a dozen now a days. We have seen an influx of Alien takeovers recently and it is getting a bit stale I must admit.  Don't get me wrong, I love films about ET's taking over, but Hollywood has beaten that horse to death.  ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a welcome change to this trend pitting us measly humans against our closest ancestors, Great Apes.  Directed by Rupert Wyatt (""The Escapist"") and supported by the unbelievable WETA Digital (""King Kong"", ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Avatar"") for special effects. ""Apes"" is a wonder of motion capture, an intelligent heart felt script with great direction.  Unfortunately, the human actors left a lot to be desired.  But this film isn't about the humans, it's all about the Simians.As plots go, this is pretty basic.  James Franco plays Will Rodman, a brilliant scientist with a breakthrough drug that just may cure Alzheimer's.  Rodman and his team are using chimpanzee's to test this new drug and in the process find out that it increases intelligence as well as repair cells in the brain.  One of the test subjects gets loose in an intense sequence and ultimately put down.  It turns out that she had just given birth to a beautiful baby chimp who inherited this new ""altered"" gene.  Rodman decides the only moral thing to do is to take the baby home while a co-worker tries to find a sanctuary but once Rodman finds out that this little ball of fur has the intelligence of a human child twice it's age he decides to keep and raise the chimp as a child.  It's only a matter of time that our chimp Caesar figures out he is not like the other children in the neighborhood.  Rodman is forced to give up Caesar to an ""Ape Sanctuary"" and there begins some of the most exhilarating revolutionary action I've ever seen.Technically, this film is massive.  The work WETA Digital did with motion capture (mo-cap) is truly a wonder to behold.  Visual Effects Supervisor with WETA Digital Joe Letteri stated that they built on the technology used in ""Avatar"" to produce the most realistic and accurate portrayal of the actors suited to play the Simians.  Andy Serkis (Gollum from ""Lord of the Rings"" and Kong from ""King Kong"") plays chimp Caesar.  Serkis manages to fool all of us into believing he is a real animal with super intelligence.  His facial emotions and mannerisms should most certainly nominate him for an Oscar.  There is a real connection that the audience feels with Caesar and it is all thanks to Serkis' work.  Without such an experienced mo-cap actor, this film would not have been such a success.Not only is the technology used to create the revolution amazing, the action is top notch as well.  Many times I found myself with my jaw on the floor from the intense sequences put to screen.  Everything from a simple terrifying look from an angry ape to the full out battle on the Golden Gate Bridge was pulled off without a hitch.  Many points to the pacing of the films action as it could have been the crutch that killed this beast of a film.  One of the most amazing scenes in my opinion is when a group of apes are fleeing over top a suburban neighborhood through the trees.  While this is going on we see some people on the street while leaves upon leaves are falling to the ground.  This level of detail is apparent in every shot, brilliant work by the production team.My only problems with this film is the acting from Franco and Freida Pinto, who plays the love interest.  They both seemed to ""phone it in"" as it were.  They were not overly impressive and just seemed stale.  Maybe the director wanted them to tone it down so that Serkis would have more of an impact acting as a voiceless chimp.  Either way, as I said in the beginning, this film wasn't about the humans.  It's about compassion, freedom and understanding and on those levels the film is a grand success.",4,Apes have risen to #1 in this reviewers heart,1313107200,"08 12, 2011",2011,3862,"['Disaster', 'movies', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'now', 'days', 'have', 'seen', 'influx', 'Alien', 'takeovers', 'recently', 'getting', 'bit', 'stale', 'must', 'admit', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'films', 'ET', 'taking', 'Hollywood', 'beaten', 'horse', 'death', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'welcome', 'change', 'trend', 'pitting', 'measly', 'closest', 'ancestors', 'Great', 'Apes', 'Directed', 'Rupert', 'Wyatt', 'Escapist', 'supported', 'unbelievable', 'WETA', 'Digital', 'King', 'Kong', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Avatar', 'special', 'effects', 'Apes', 'wonder', 'motion', 'capture', 'intelligent', 'heart', 'felt', 'script', 'great', 'direction', 'Unfortunately', 'human', 'actors', 'left', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'film', ""n't"", 'humans', 'Simians.As', 'plots', 'go', 'pretty', 'basic', 'James', 'Franco', 'plays', 'Will', 'Rodman', 'brilliant', 'scientist', 'breakthrough', 'drug', 'just', 'may', 'cure', 'Alzheimer', 'Rodman', 'team', 'are', 'using', 'chimpanzee', 'test', 'new', 'drug', 'process', 'find', 'out', 'intelligence', 'as', 'well', 'repair', 'cells', 'brain', 'One', 'test', 'loose', 'intense', 'sequence', 'ultimately', 'put', 'down', 'out', 'had', 'just', 'given', 'birth', 'beautiful', 'baby', 'chimp', 'who', 'inherited', 'new', 'altered', 'gene', 'Rodman', 'only', 'moral', 'thing', 'do', 'take', 'baby', 'home', 'co-worker', 'tries', 'find', 'sanctuary', 'once', 'Rodman', 'out', 'little', 'ball', 'fur', 'intelligence', 'human', 'child', 'twice', 'age', 'keep', 'raise', 'chimp', 'child', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'chimp', 'Caesar', 'out', 'not', 'other', 'children', 'neighborhood', 'Rodman', 'forced', 'give', 'up', 'Caesar', 'Ape', 'Sanctuary', 'most', 'exhilarating', 'revolutionary', 'action', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Technically', 'film', 'massive', 'work', 'WETA', 'Digital', 'did', 'motion', 'capture', 'mo-cap', 'truly', 'wonder', 'behold', 'Visual', 'Effects', 'Supervisor', 'WETA', 'Digital', 'Joe', 'Letteri', 'stated', 'built', 'technology', 'used', 'Avatar', 'produce', 'most', 'realistic', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'actors', 'suited', 'play', 'Simians', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'Gollum', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Kong', 'King', 'Kong', 'chimp', 'Caesar', 'Serkis', 'fool', 'believing', 'real', 'animal', 'super', 'intelligence', 'facial', 'emotions', 'mannerisms', 'should', 'most', 'certainly', 'nominate', 'Oscar', 'real', 'connection', 'audience', 'feels', 'Caesar', 'thanks', 'Serkis', 'work', 'experienced', 'mo-cap', 'actor', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'success.Not', 'only', 'technology', 'used', 'create', 'revolution', 'amazing', 'action', 'top', 'notch', 'as', 'well', 'Many', 'times', 'found', 'jaw', 'floor', 'intense', 'sequences', 'put', 'screen', 'Everything', 'simple', 'terrifying', 'look', 'angry', 'ape', 'full', 'out', 'battle', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'was', 'pulled', 'off', 'hitch', 'Many', 'points', 'pacing', 'films', 'action', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'crutch', 'killed', 'beast', 'film', 'One', 'most', 'amazing', 'scenes', 'opinion', 'when', 'group', 'apes', 'are', 'fleeing', 'top', 'suburban', 'neighborhood', 'trees', 'going', 'see', 'people', 'street', 'leaves', 'leaves', 'are', 'falling', 'ground', 'level', 'detail', 'apparent', 'shot', 'brilliant', 'work', 'production', 'only', 'problems', 'film', 'acting', 'Franco', 'Freida', 'Pinto', 'who', 'love', 'interest', 'seemed', 'phone', 'were', 'were', 'not', 'overly', 'impressive', 'just', 'seemed', 'stale', 'Maybe', 'director', 'wanted', 'tone', 'down', 'so', 'Serkis', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'impact', 'acting', 'voiceless', 'chimp', 'way', 'said', 'beginning', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'humans', 'compassion', 'freedom', 'understanding', 'levels', 'film', 'grand', 'success']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

1415805,ALWB64XOXNMDP,B004LWZW4M,Picardfan007,"[2, 2]","I just saw Rise of the Planet of the Apes film.  It was an impressive debut to a much maligned franchise film. The film starts with a scientist who is on the edge of discovering a cure for Alzheimer's disease. John Litgow portrays his ailing father. Although his role is understated and small; it contributes to the main plot.  Going against the policy of the corporation, the doctor injects his father with the new serum.  He miraculously gets better and improves in his cognitive ability.  Caesar, the ape that he tested for the cure, is becoming increasingly super intelligent.Almost the entire film focuses on  Caesar's rise to power. Under a different studio, this film might have been very gratuitous and violent.  It has enough over the top action to carry the film, yet it's restrained in it's use of violence. Caesar's first spoken word is ""No!"", when he orders his  troops not to harm others.  It has an epic scope that wasn't possible in the early films.  With CGI, an ape army of thousands can be seen running down the Golden Gate Bridge at rush hour.  There was a good resolution and future to the franchise after this movie. I'd like to see the director helm the next segment in this compelling series.I have such clear memories of the first five movies. I wasn't old enough to watch them in the theater.  However, watching them on TV, made me a life long fan.  The TV series in 1974 only ran for thirteen episodes before it was cancelled. Roddy McDowell who portrayed Cornelius in the film, returned to play a character called Galen in the series.  Roddy brought a respectability to a show that was constantly dismissed by critics.  Mark Leonard, took the role of General Urko of the secret police force in Ape City.I purchased the show on DVD five years ago.  It's scripts had good life lessons a morality tales that made a huge impression on me as a child.The late 90's version of Planet of the Apes directed by Tim Burton, pales in comparison to this recent update.  If you get the opportunity to see Burton's movie; you'll see he didn't have a good vision on the franchise.  It was more about costumes and atmosphere.  The story logic didn't follow the previously established mythology.Planet of the Apes fan since 1968",5,"Finally, A Great Planet of the Apes movie!!!!!!",1323820800,"12 14, 2011",2011,2238,"['just', 'saw', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'film', 'was', 'impressive', 'debut', 'much', 'maligned', 'franchise', 'film', 'film', 'scientist', 'who', 'edge', 'discovering', 'cure', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'John', 'Litgow', 'ailing', 'father', 'role', 'understated', 'small', 'main', 'plot', 'Going', 'policy', 'corporation', 'doctor', 'father', 'new', 'serum', 'miraculously', 'better', 'cognitive', 'ability', 'Caesar', 'ape', 'tested', 'cure', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'super', 'intelligent.Almost', 'entire', 'film', 'focuses', 'Caesar', 'rise', 'power', 'different', 'studio', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'gratuitous', 'violent', 'enough', 'top', 'action', 'carry', 'film', 'restrained', 'use', 'violence', 'Caesar', 'first', 'spoken', 'word', 'No', 'when', 'orders', 'troops', 'not', 'harm', 'others', 'epic', 'scope', 'was', ""n't"", 'possible', 'early', 'films', 'CGI', 'ape', 'army', 'thousands', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'running', 'down', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'rush', 'hour', 'was', 'good', 'resolution', 'future', 'franchise', 'movie', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'director', 'helm', 'next', 'segment', 'compelling', 'series.I', 'have', 'such', 'clear', 'memories', 'first', 'five', 'movies', 'was', ""n't"", 'old', 'enough', 'watch', 'theater', 'However', 'watching', 'TV', 'made', 'life', 'long', 'fan', 'TV', 'series', '1974', 'only', 'ran', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'was', 'cancelled', 'Roddy', 'McDowell', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Cornelius', 'film', 'returned', 'play', 'character', 'called', 'Galen', 'series', 'Roddy', 'brought', 'respectability', 'show', 'was', 'constantly', 'dismissed', 'critics', 'Mark', 'Leonard', 'took', 'role', 'General', 'Urko', 'secret', 'police', 'force', 'Ape', 'City.I', 'purchased', 'show', 'DVD', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'scripts', 'had', 'good', 'life', 'lessons', 'morality', 'made', 'huge', 'impression', 'child.The', 'late', '90', 'version', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'directed', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'comparison', 'recent', 'update', 'get', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Burton', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'good', 'vision', 'franchise', 'was', 'more', 'costumes', 'atmosphere', 'story', 'logic', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'previously', 'established', 'mythology.Planet', 'Apes', 'fan', '1968']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes
1415806,A660C2X0UDO6Z,B004LWZW4M,"Pierre Ricolando ""Rico""","[10, 11]","This was the only Apes movie I saw in the series, and fittingly this is meant to happen first.  I don't have the other movies to reference, and I also don't have them to nitpick about something that may be missing, if there even is.  Since I am basing my review on this movie alone as a stand alone movie, and not a prequel or sequel, it may be a little different otherwise.GraphicsI was so amazed at the CGI used in the movie.  At times, I was forgetting that I was looking at a computer image, rather than a real chimp.  The actor here, Mr. Serkis, is an amazingly talented individual when it comes to facial features, and being able to make computer generated characters seem more realistic than the human characters in the movies he is in.  Gollom, King Kong, and now this one really makes him a bona fide celebrity in my eye, though most people wouldn't recognize him if they saw him anywhere.  Not only Caesar, but the other CGI monkeys and other apes are perfectly executed.  Though I liked the human characters as well, the CGI definitely overshadowed their performances hands down.PlotThe plot was so enthralling.  Delving into themes in the same facet of Frankenstein, where trying to use genetics and science to play some sort of God, really resonated with me.  I went with my cousin, and he wasn't able to get past the hokey parts or seeing the apes talk.  I was in complete rapture at the transformation of Caesar, and just like the Joker character in Dark Knight left me begging for more, though he was in it a heck of a lot more than Joker was.  It was interesting to see him shun his friends to team up with previous enemies in order to take control of the situation.  The movie seemed long in the theaters, and I don't know if it was because I was simply tired before going to it, or if it truly was a long movie.  It took quite a bit of time to build up to the climax, and not all of it was tedious, though some of it surely was.  I was not lacking, I do not believe, because I had not seen the previous installments and was able to keep up with the plot simply enough without it.  Because this was meant to be the origin, I think that definitely helped in that aspect.  It did, however, make me want to see the others to see if anything would be cleared up in any way.All in all, this is a great movie experience.  If you like a good story, it's there.  If you like good action, It's there. If you like enhancing graphics, it's definitely there.This movie seemed to have something for every movie lover out there, so grab the popcorn and enjoy the ride.",4,Never saw any of the others so take it for what it's worth,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,2572,"['was', 'only', 'Apes', 'movie', 'saw', 'series', 'fittingly', 'meant', 'happen', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'movies', 'reference', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'nitpick', 'something', 'may', 'be', 'missing', 'even', 'am', 'basing', 'review', 'movie', 'alone', 'stand', 'alone', 'movie', 'not', 'prequel', 'sequel', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'different', 'otherwise.GraphicsI', 'was', 'so', 'amazed', 'CGI', 'used', 'movie', 'times', 'was', 'forgetting', 'was', 'looking', 'computer', 'image', 'rather', 'real', 'chimp', 'actor', 'here', 'Mr.', 'Serkis', 'amazingly', 'talented', 'individual', 'when', 'facial', 'features', 'being', 'able', 'make', 'computer', 'generated', 'characters', 'seem', 'more', 'realistic', 'human', 'characters', 'movies', 'Gollom', 'King', 'Kong', 'now', 'one', 'really', 'bona', 'fide', 'celebrity', 'eye', 'most', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'saw', 'anywhere', 'Not', 'only', 'Caesar', 'other', 'CGI', 'monkeys', 'other', 'apes', 'are', 'perfectly', 'executed', 'liked', 'human', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'CGI', 'definitely', 'overshadowed', 'performances', 'down.PlotThe', 'plot', 'was', 'so', 'enthralling', 'Delving', 'themes', 'same', 'facet', 'Frankenstein', 'where', 'trying', 'use', 'genetics', 'science', 'play', 'sort', 'God', 'really', 'resonated', 'went', 'cousin', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'get', 'hokey', 'parts', 'seeing', 'apes', 'talk', 'was', 'complete', 'rapture', 'transformation', 'Caesar', 'just', 'Joker', 'character', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'left', 'begging', 'more', 'was', 'heck', 'lot', 'more', 'Joker', 'was', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'shun', 'friends', 'team', 'up', 'previous', 'enemies', 'order', 'take', 'control', 'situation', 'movie', 'seemed', 'long', 'theaters', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'was', 'simply', 'tired', 'before', 'going', 'truly', 'was', 'long', 'movie', 'took', 'quite', 'bit', 'time', 'build', 'up', 'climax', 'not', 'was', 'tedious', 'surely', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'lacking', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'previous', 'installments', 'was', 'able', 'keep', 'up', 'plot', 'simply', 'enough', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'origin', 'think', 'definitely', 'helped', 'aspect', 'did', 'however', 'make', 'want', 'see', 'others', 'see', 'anything', 'would', 'be', 'cleared', 'up', 'way.All', 'great', 'movie', 'experience', 'like', 'good', 'story', 'there', 'like', 'good', 'action', 'there', 'like', 'enhancing', 'graphics', 'definitely', 'there.This', 'movie', 'seemed', 'have', 'something', 'movie', 'there', 'popcorn', 'enjoy', 'ride']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

1415816,A2TY359PR45ATP,B004LWZW4M,"R. Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2""","[0, 0]","This is an exceptionally well crafted sci/fi movie. I have seen all the &#34;POTA&#34; movies including the lame Tim Burton/Mark Wahlberg remake of 2001; but it matters not whether you have seen them, as this is a prequel to the 1968 Charlton Heston original. It borrows a few plot points from the fourth &#34;POTA&#34; film, which was also an origin story; but it doesn't borrow much. Bottom line, this film stands on its own, which is fine; because it is likely the beginning of many sequels to follow. The tagline for the movie is &#34;Evolution becomes revolution&#34;; but the source for the intelligence of the apes in this film is not natural evolution, but genetic engineering intended to create a cure for Alzheimer's. The retrovirus developed from the engineering does indeed temporarily cure Alzheimer's, but it exponentially enhances the intelligence of the test apes...and it is genetically passed on to their progeny. James Franco, in another fine performance, is Will Rodman, the genetic engineer who develops the retrovirus. He adopts a baby chimp, he names Caesar, after the chimp's mother, the main test ape, turns violent and has to be put down. The retrovirus is not approved for human use, but Rodman uses it on his father, excellent portrayal by John Lithgow, and the temporary result is extraordinary. Caesar has inherited his mother's intelligence...he is played superbly by Andy Serkis (Gollum in the &#34;LOTR Trilogy&#34;) using motion capture technology...and his intelligence continues to improve. That will set the stage; if you are intrigued so far, watch this fine sci/fi actioner to see how it plays out. In addition to the actors named, look for Tom Felton as a sadistic animal keeper and Freida Pinto as Rodman's love interest. If you are a fan of well made, intelligent science fiction, you will love this.

1415817,AV33FCIDH59N8,B004LWZW4M,Reviewer,"[4, 6]","The movie was really great with a very plausible story and great acting by all.  It was casted and directed very well and echoes of the original POTA feature films but with a modern edge to it.  The movie ties in the original series where the apes actually DO take over where before, in the 70's versions, we do not actually see this.  And true to the original version, humans are affected by a virus although the original version has a different cause than the modern version.  I like this version better because it is far more convincing in the whole take over process.What bothered me a bit is the overly animated movement of the chimps.  When an animal motion is animated in computer or hand drawn, it is once removed from life.  Then it is twice removed from life when it is transferred to film or some other media process.  So it is important for the animators to get it right without overdoing it but with enough ""animated"" behavior that we get it and are convinced by it.I didn't quite feel that I was convinced and it wasn't because of the quality of the CG but rather it was the movements.  They were a bit unnatural in various parts of their actions.  The chimps didn't have the heft and weight to them and even some of their moves were overly exaggerated, particularly in Ceasar's behavior as a young chimp.  As a baby, there is very little movement in baby chimps, more clingy and subdued.  They have an instinct to coddle.  As Ceasar grew to be two and three years old, the movements were too rubbery and practically bouncing off the walls instead of looking like heavy, swift, and robust like he is supposed to be.  The apes throughout also moved way too quickly and lightly whereas apes in general have a more weightiness to them.  These animated apes seemed a bit too bouncy and almost too wiggly at times.  This was especially true of the orangutangs.  Orangutangs generally move very slowly and these guys were like spider monkies when they swung around.Before you start beating me up for my comments, (I teach animal motion and biomechanics in an animal drawing and anatomy class for a university and many of my students are 2-D artists and 3-D animators, just so you know.  I've studied animal motion and behavior for years - and even train animals.  My experience may be more limited than some but enough to know that some of the action was a bit more exaggerated and it did'nt have to be!That being said, it was a really great film and I eventually lost my critiqing part of my brain after a while and settled in to the movie.  The story was written extremely well.  It was fresh while still keeping step with the 70's original tone.  It was a convincing story, acted well, and had humanity elements in it, fitting for our concerns of our modern times.  The full gamut of human emotions played through this movie, ribboning its way through wave after wave.  Love and compassion pendulated between rage and extreme frustration, we see the world through Ceasar's eyes and his scientist human.  In the end there is the final the taste of sweet revenge and freedom.  The action and plots played out at a great pace also and there were no segways or layers that were not relevant. The movie is pretty fast paced and exciting all the way!Amazingly done well and absolutely fantastic was the facial expressions that came across so convincingly.  The apes had amazingly realistic expressions (and they had to because they lacked story telling dialog) and their emotions were so clearly read.  The acting with the eyes and body language rang so clear that even a human could read the emotions from their posture and gaze.  Real apes do display various emotional expressions without contorting their faces but this movie went a step further.  Ceasar was a far more sophisticated creature than his brothers so his face revealed a higher intellectual process and you can really see the wheels turning in his eyes!  What a fantastic job!The whole movie was an amazing production for everyone involved.  Especially the actors and digital animators - they should really be commended and get a award for this.  Awesome job!There were more layers in this movie than the straight line of the original ape sagas.  The multi-layered story worked well and everything wrapped into other layers, coming together at the end.  It is a great movie in spite of my critical comments, and I'm buying my copy soon!",5,Great Movie!

1415843,A1BPCX5TX2HNRQ,B004LWZW4M,Russ Nickel,"[217, 267]","For a movie whose trailer seemed fake at first glance (a serious drama about a superintelligent ape and his issues?), RotPotA (rot-POT-uh) does an incredible job getting you invested in the plight of a chimp. Low budget for a summer blockbuster, this ninety million dollar film focuses on the rise of Caesar, first of his species and leader of the apes. We watch as he grows up, casts off his human friendships, and eventually leads a revolt in the hopes of achieving freedom for his people, err, his fellow apes.Whether or not you're going to like this movie boils down to one thing: can you buy into it? Can you lay your hard-earned money on the line and accept Caesar as a fully human character with hopes and fears? Since the actual humans are sort of irrelevant and the apes are incapable of speech, there's not a lot to go on. Basically, if you liked the first 40 minutes of Wall-E, then you'll probably be fine. Caesar may not be a lovable trash robot (or is he?! Twist!), but Andy Serkis does an incredible job conveying his feelings through his motions. Serkis must've spent years living among the apes of the wild to achieve such realistic mimicry (he went to Rwanda and chilled in zoos!), and he strikes epic and expressive poses aplenty, each one conveying Caesar's thoughts without feeling obvious and overblown. By the end of the movie, you'll care more about Caesar than any actual human (in the film--hopefully not in real life). You'll fear for his friends and root for his victory. Honestly, an ape that likable? I'll let him rise above me any day.Once you're down with the movie's premise, and once you're finally ok with Franco's whole ""Let's make a much more aggressive form of this untested virus! What could possibly go wrong?"" line of thinking, you're ready to experience a truly great film.The movie builds and builds, each scene more intense than the last. Watching Caesar slowly learn to despise humanity is fantastic, and when he finally becomes a total champion, you're with him all the way. There's a moment when the music changes and Caesar first uses a basic tool to win his freedom, and I couldn't have been more stoked. Then he goes on to recruit his friends, who are all hardcore. I wasn't really sure what their names were, so I made my own: Grayback, the original leader whom Caesar overthrows, Jowly, the friendly circus orangutan with giant, jiggling jowls, Kong, the huge gorilla, and Scar, the one-eyed embodiment of evil. While they cannot be as well drawn as normal human characters due to the lack of dialogue, I still had a distinct understanding of each of their personalities.Just like I distinctly understood Draco Malfoy's new character. He once again nailed the sniveling jerk role. I hated that guy so much. He was just so mean to the apes! I guess what he didn't count on was that they'd all become superintelligent. Nobody expects that (in that way, it's like the Spanish Inquisition). His somewhat subpar predictive powers aside, he does get the best Planet of the Apes reference, shouting, ""Take your stinking paws off me, you d*mn dirty ape!""It's people like that who'll make the apes kill us all, which reminds me: the climax of this movie is crazy epic. It takes place on the Golden Gate bridge, and it's unbelievably fun to watch the ramshackle ape army use their new intelligence to take on the unprepared humans.Not everything was perfectly executed, but all the problems feel like pointless nitpicks. Some characters agree to things a little too quickly, one or two lines are just a little off, Franco gives up on freeing Caesar super easily, the girlfriend should've had either a much larger or much smaller role, and they don't show some scenes of the other apes getting exposed to the intelligence drug (I just assume they cut that scene but that it happened). Also, the entire audience laughed at the epic/heartwarming scene between James Franco and Caesar in the forest at the end, and while it did feel a little ridiculous, it's that same issue I brought up before. You have to buy into this film. You have to let go of that cynical part of you and allow yourself to enjoy what you're seeing. The movie takes its premise 100% seriously, and there's no room for laughter.In the end, this film is so good that I found myself lost in it. I was unaware of the music, the pacing, the acting, everything, because I was just too busy being completely invested and enjoying the heck out of myself. I cannot wait for the sequel. In a rare piece of cinema, this movie managed to feel complete on its own and yet leave you craving more. If you had to see one film this summer (and you didn't care about the cultural impact of Harry Potter), this would be it.Score: 4.5/5 One of the best end credits ever. Rarely do I actually care about what's happening in the background behind the names, but here I was devastated.Check out more on ""The Nickel Screen"" (Google it!)",5,Caesar Rises to

Upon receiving the medicine she becomes extremely intelligent, solving puzzles that no normal ape would be able to solve. She later on gives birth to an ape, who also shows signs that he is just as intelligent and therefore the mother genetically passed it onto him. The mother was killed in the lab and therefore one of the workers decided to take the baby ape home before the other workers found it and decided to kill him as well. This is how the movie starts off.Now, without giving too much info away, Caesar eventually has a desire to stand up to human kind after he learns what happened to his mother and how he doesn't fit in with the human world (let's face it, he's as smart as a human but everyone sees him as nothing more than an ape).I'll end it there because otherwise I will give too much info away about the movie. I just have to say that this movie was absolutely amazing though. It really does make you feel sorrow toward not only the animals in the movie, but in the real world.

That said, it was much better than Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes!  Still, not as good as the well-acted films by Charlton Heston.James Franco plays a scientist who discovers a cure for Alzheimer's which his dad is suffering from.  After an accident where an ape escapes and is put down, his boss Jacobs, who cares more about his bottom line than lives, orders all the apes put down.These apes are intelligent thanks to Franco's experiments.  He's created a virus that strengthens the brain and thus humans.  He tries it on his dad to great results but finds they are not lasting.He then creates a stronger virus!This is where the story gets weird.  As he is experimenting, there's an accident where the virus escapes.  Klutz nerd assistant was not wearing his mask.No quarantine?  Klutz then goes home, calls in sick.  Really?  And then he wanders all over the neighborhood looking for Franco's character and sneezes on people.  Yikes!The virus apparently causes brain hemmorage in humans, yet makes apes smart.  And it's a stronger virus, too.Another thing:  Franco's character steals some virus and leaves it in his fridge at home.  Really?  A highly toxic virus next to the eggs and milk?  How domestic.  Not only does he NOT get fired from his job, he also keeps the stronger virus from later in the story in the same fridge, which his ape pal Cesar uses to great effect.The whole story of Cesar, the last survivor of the ape purge earlier in the film, is quite interesting.  But the ape, after taking over an ape facility (where we hear the Heston quote regarding damn dirty apes!) wreaks havoc upon San Francisco, doesn't like taking human life but leaves a bloody black mess on the Golden Gate Bridge, and takes up residence in Muir Woods.That's it?  Intelligent apes hanging out in Muir Woods and Franco's character only says &#34;OK?&#34;  No talking Cesar out of it, no real characterization here that could have been done, but the film is rushed at this point.The End?Mid-credit scene where the guy who was sneezed at (Remember McKay from  Stargate: Atlantis?) goes to an airport and promptly spreads the virus to all points.Intelligent Apes?  The end of Man-As-We-Know-It?Who knows?Really hope the sequel makes more sense.  :)",3,It's Pretty Good Monkey Business,1402272000,"06 9, 2014",2014,2337,"['Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'had', 'good', 'things', 'going', 'overall', 'was', 'unsatisfying', 'said', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Still', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'well-acted', 'films', 'Charlton', 'Heston.James', 'Franco', 'scientist', 'who', 'cure', 'Alzheimer', 'dad', 'suffering', 'accident', 'where', 'ape', 'escapes', 'put', 'down', 'boss', 'Jacobs', 'who', 'more', 'bottom', 'line', 'lives', 'orders', 'apes', 'put', 'down.These', 'apes', 'are', 'intelligent', 'thanks', 'Franco', 'experiments', 'created', 'virus', 'brain', 'thus', 'humans', 'dad', 'great', 'results', 'are', 'not', 'lasting.He', 'then', 'stronger', 'virus', 'where', 'story', 'weird', 'experimenting', 'accident', 'where', 'virus', 'Klutz', 'nerd', 'assistant', 'was', 'not', 'wearing', 'mask.No', 'quarantine', 'Klutz', 'then', 'home', 'sick', 'Really', 'then', 'neighborhood', 'looking', 'Franco', 'character', 'sneezes', 'people', 'virus', 'apparently', 'brain', 'hemmorage', 'humans', 'yet', 'apes', 'smart', 'stronger', 'virus', 'too.Another', 'thing', 'Franco', 'character', 'virus', 'fridge', 'home', 'Really', 'highly', 'toxic', 'virus', 'eggs', 'milk', 'How', 'domestic', 'Not', 'only', 'NOT', 'get', 'fired', 'job', 'also', 'stronger', 'virus', 'later', 'story', 'same', 'fridge', 'ape', 'pal', 'Cesar', 'great', 'effect.The', 'whole', 'story', 'Cesar', 'last', 'survivor', 'ape', 'purge', 'earlier', 'film', 'quite', 'interesting', 'ape', 'taking', 'over', 'ape', 'facility', 'where', 'hear', 'Heston', 'quote', 'regarding', 'damn', 'dirty', 'apes', 'havoc', 'San', 'Francisco', ""n't"", 'like', 'taking', 'human', 'life', 'bloody', 'black', 'mess', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'up', 'residence', 'Muir', 'Woods.That', 'Intelligent', 'hanging', 'out', 'Muir', 'Woods', 'Franco', 'character', 'only', '34', 'OK', '34', 'talking', 'Cesar', 'real', 'characterization', 'here', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'film', 'rushed', 'point.The', 'End', 'Mid-credit', 'scene', 'where', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'sneezed', 'Remember', 'McKay', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis', 'airport', 'promptly', 'virus', 'points.Intelligent', 'Apes', 'end', 'Man-As-We-Know-It', 'Who', 'Really', 'hope', 'sequel', 'more', 'sense']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

Suspend your disbelief and you'll enjoy this movie!First of all I don't think that the premise, at least with experimenting with medicine to stop or reverse Alzheimer's is all that far off in the future....in fact I keep hearing that there is some ready now for human experimentation.Some people are bummed by the fact that these intelligence boasting drugs are given to the monkeys/apes to increase their I.Q. rather than them evolving over time on their own. It doesn't bother me at all, in fact the parts that some others found boring, I found the most interesting.The animals become more intelligent, escape their captors, but then what? I guess that's where a sequel comes in.I like James Franco but he doesn't give a very convincing performance in this. There were at least 3 scenes which called for some genuine emotion and he was just blah! This annoys me about him as an actor....he can turn in terrific performances in some films and then be so mediocre in others.Luckily, there's Andy Serkis who plays Caesar, the chimp that Franco rescues as a baby from being destroyed and raises as his own. Caesar is advanced way beyond his human counterparts due to experimentation with his mother, and it being passed down to him. I rooted for him and that's what this film hopes that we'll do, so in that regard it accomplished what it set out to do! Serkis is absolutely amazing as Caesar, both in mannerism's and athletic ability!

1415853,A73QPH7NGI0DJ,B004LWZW4M,Sean Curley,"[3, 5]","1968's ""Planet of the Apes"" was a bold piece of science fiction, scripted with characteristic intelligence by Rod Serling, the creator of ""The Twilight Zone"".  It spawned four sequels (despite star Charlton Heston's attempt to kill the franchise with the ending of the second film), generally held to be of declining quality, and various other spinoffs; Tim Burton previously attempted to reboot the series in 2001 with a film starring Mark Wahlberg and Tim Roth, but that was poorly received.  Now, a decade later, Hollywood has another go, helmed by newcomer Rupert Wyatt and scripted by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver.  To be honest, given the relatively unknown creative team and the seeming gratuitousness of the project, I initially wrote this off as a cheap cash grab.  To my surprise, however, the result is a smart and interesting film that ranks as one of the summer's better movies, supported by phenomenal special affects a great lead performance by Andy Serkis.  Spoilers follow.This seems to be a reboot (though I've seen suggestions that this fits reasonably well with the background suggested by the original film; but the first film series could never get its continuity straight anyway), with the first film's Cold War fears of nuclear Armageddon replaced by the most potent fears of the 21st:  genetic engineering and global pandemics.  But that's getting ahead of ourselves.  We follow Dr. Will Rodman (James Franco, who's competent but not at his best here), an Alzheimers researcher who plans to use gene therapy to allow the human brain to develop new cells, and tests it first on chimps.  The result is Caesar (created by Andy Serkis and WETA's CGI magicians), an extremely intelligent ape capable  of communication with humans and with cognitive skills far exceeding a human at the same age.  Will hopes to use the therapy to cure his father (John Lithgow, affecting with comparatively little screentime), while his boss Jacobs (British actor David Oyelowo, in a rather thankless part) sees the potential for huge profits.  However, when an incident leads to Caesar being confined to an ape sanctuary, his ties to humanity rupture, thanks in great part to the abusive handler (Tom Felton, basically doing his Draco Malfoy dragon-tickling schtick with an American accent).It has become common to say that Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" depicts the computer HAL as more human than the actual human characters, an opinion I don't necessarily agree with, but a comparable effect is in evidence here:  Caesar is by far the best-realized character, a tremendous technical achievement that moviemakers twenty years ago could only dream of.  James Franco, in the human lead part, is uninspired.  Lithgow is the most effective member of the human cast, bringing great resonance to the elderly Charles.  ""Slumdog Millionaire""'s Freida Pinto has the utterly thankless part of Will's primatologist girlfriend Caroline, who is barely in the film (in a sequel, hopefully they'll do more with this character), though she looks lovely throughout.  Tom Felton, as the abusive animal handler, accomplishes his primary function:  making the audience eagerly anticipate his comeuppance.  In a film that otherwise tries to be fairly balanced in depicting both the human and ape sides, he's the most obvious villain.  I found the ""profit motive"" angle with Oyelowo's character a bit overdone (and, when you examine the actual events of the film, Oyelowo's greed doesn't actually lead to any of the big consequences, all of which result directly from actions taken by James Franco's character).The film ends on an oddy hopeful note, before a sinister mid-credits scene reveals much more detail on the impending doom of human civilization, something that the new franchise carefully avoids assigning to the apes, in keeping with the attempt not to overtly villainize either side.  There are a number of callbacks included in the movie to the earlier films, including a respectful tip of the hat to the late Charlton Heston.All in all, this a very strong start for a revived franchise.  We await the box office results to see whether the creative team will have the opportunity to show us more of this future, but I'm certainly game to find out.",4,"A new ""Apes"" story gets off to a surprisingly good start.",1312502400,"08 5, 2011",2011,4254,"['1968', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'was', 'bold', 'piece', 'science', 'fiction', 'scripted', 'characteristic', 'intelligence', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'creator', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'spawned', 'four', 'sequels', 'star', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'attempt', 'kill', 'franchise', 'ending', 'second', 'film', 'generally', 'held', 'be', 'declining', 'quality', 'various', 'other', 'spinoffs', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'previously', 'attempted', 'reboot', 'series', '2001', 'film', 'starring', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'was', 'poorly', 'received', 'Now', 'decade', 'later', 'Hollywood', 'go', 'helmed', 'newcomer', 'Rupert', 'Wyatt', 'scripted', 'Rick', 'Jaffa', 'Amanda', 'Silver', 'be', 'honest', 'given', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'creative', 'team', 'seeming', 'gratuitousness', 'project', 'initially', 'wrote', 'off', 'cheap', 'cash', 'grab', 'surprise', 'however', 'result', 'smart', 'interesting', 'film', 'one', 'summer', 'better', 'movies', 'supported', 'phenomenal', 'special', 'great', 'lead', 'performance', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'Spoilers', 'follow.This', 'be', 'reboot', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'suggestions', 'reasonably', 'well', 'background', 'suggested', 'original', 'film', 'first', 'film', 'series', 'could', 'never', 'get', 'continuity', 'straight', 'anyway', 'first', 'film', 'Cold', 'War', 'fears', 'nuclear', 'Armageddon', 'replaced', 'most', 'potent', 'fears', '21st', 'genetic', 'engineering', 'global', 'pandemics', 'getting', 'ahead', 'ourselves', 'follow', 'Dr.', 'Will', 'Rodman', 'James', 'Franco', 'who', 'competent', 'not', 'best', 'here', 'Alzheimers', 'researcher', 'who', 'use', 'gene', 'therapy', 'allow', 'human', 'brain', 'develop', 'new', 'cells', 'tests', 'first', 'chimps', 'result', 'Caesar', 'created', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'WETA', 'CGI', 'magicians', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'ape', 'capable', 'communication', 'humans', 'cognitive', 'skills', 'far', 'exceeding', 'human', 'same', 'age', 'Will', 'hopes', 'use', 'therapy', 'cure', 'father', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'affecting', 'comparatively', 'little', 'screentime', 'boss', 'Jacobs', 'British', 'actor', 'David', 'Oyelowo', 'rather', 'thankless', 'part', 'potential', 'huge', 'profits', 'However', 'when', 'incident', 'Caesar', 'being', 'confined', 'ape', 'sanctuary', 'ties', 'humanity', 'rupture', 'thanks', 'great', 'part', 'abusive', 'handler', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'basically', 'doing', 'Draco', 'Malfoy', 'dragon-tickling', 'schtick', 'American', 'accent', '.It', 'become', 'common', 'say', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'computer', 'HAL', 'more', 'human', 'actual', 'human', 'characters', 'opinion', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'agree', 'comparable', 'effect', 'evidence', 'here', 'Caesar', 'far', 'best-realized', 'character', 'tremendous', 'technical', 'achievement', 'moviemakers', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'could', 'only', 'dream', 'James', 'Franco', 'human', 'lead', 'part', 'uninspired', 'Lithgow', 'most', 'effective', 'member', 'human', 'cast', 'bringing', 'great', 'resonance', 'elderly', 'Charles', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'Freida', 'Pinto', 'utterly', 'thankless', 'part', 'Will', 'primatologist', 'girlfriend', 'Caroline', 'who', 'barely', 'film', 'sequel', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'do', 'more', 'character', 'lovely', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'abusive', 'animal', 'handler', 'primary', 'function', 'making', 'audience', 'eagerly', 'anticipate', 'comeuppance', 'film', 'otherwise', 'be', 'fairly', 'balanced', 'depicting', 'human', 'ape', 'sides', 'most', 'obvious', 'villain', 'found', 'profit', 'motive', 'angle', 'Oyelowo', 'character', 'bit', 'overdone', 'when', 'examine', 'actual', 'events', 'film', 'Oyelowo', 'greed', ""n't"", 'actually', 'lead', 'big', 'consequences', 'result', 'directly', 'actions', 'taken', 'James', 'Franco', 'character', '.The', 'film', 'oddy', 'hopeful', 'note', 'sinister', 'mid-credits', 'scene', 'reveals', 'much', 'more', 'detail', 'impending', 'doom', 'human', 'civilization', 'something', 'new', 'franchise', 'carefully', 'assigning', 'apes', 'keeping', 'attempt', 'not', 'overtly', 'villainize', 'side', 'are', 'number', 'callbacks', 'included', 'movie', 'earlier', 'films', 'including', 'respectful', 'tip', 'hat', 'late', 'Charlton', 'Heston.All', 'very', 'strong', 'start', 'revived', 'franchise', 'await', 'box', 'office', 'results', 'see', 'creative', 'team', 'will', 'have', 'opportunity', 'show', 'more', 'future', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'game', 'find', 'out']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

I was a bit worried that Hollywood would attempt to cram in too much in this ""prequel"" but they didn't.  They addressed the two main concerns that I'm sure all Planet of the Apes fans had on their minds: how do the apes come into power and what happens to the humans. Neither of these was over dramatized, and both were completely believable.James Franco plays Will Rodman, a doctor who is working on a drug to cure Alzheimer's. His father, played by John Lithgow, is suffering from it.  Just when experiments on chimps is making great progress, an accident happens and the head of the research facility shuts the lab down. He orders the chimps to be put down, but one of the assistants discovers a baby chimp in one of the cages and sends it home with Will. Will continues to develop the drug and to track the baby chimp's intelligence, which was passed on from his mother. Will names the baby Caesar.Three years later Will's father is improving because he's been given the drug, but he soon begins to lapse because his immune system starts to fight off the virus.  Will talks the research facility into trying a new strain of virus, but when one doctor is exposed to it we soon learn that the new virus is harmful to humans.  Meanwhile, Caesar is shipped off to a primate facility after an accident involving a neighbor, where he meets other chimps for the first time and his army is soon formed.Once these two story lines are set up, there's a good thirty minutes of nonstop action as the primates plan and carry out their escape. Before you know it, the movie is over!  But like I said before, it isn't pushed too far and the ending was quite satisfying to me.  My only complaint about the movie is that the CGI effects with Caesar in some places is a bit fake looking, but most of the time it looks great.  I'm sure they pushed their limits here in order to give Caesar those closer-to-human qualities and emotions, which actually do tug at your heart strings as they were probably intended to do.Lots of emotion!  Lots of action!

1415860,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B004LWZW4M,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[13, 29]","Rise of the Planet of the Apes falls flat. While the CGI ape sequences are exciting, the human element doesn't work in this incoherent reboot prequel to the Planet of the Apes Franchise. Wooden acting, bland cinematography, choppy editing and a weak story keep this film from being its best. It may be the planned start of a new franchise, but the first film out feels incomplete.My beef with Rise of the Planet of the Apes are with the production issues that hold the film back. The whole film feels like studio executives rushed it into production. Because of this, the storyline is extremely sloppy and poorly executed. The screenplay has some of the weakest dialogue I've ever seen executed onscreen. Me being a writer I actually cringed hearing some of the lines being spoken as they were so clich&eacute;. The script felt like a first draft and should have been revised.The human characters in this story are paper thin and one-dimensional, bordering on cartoonish. Their lack of depth and complexity kept me from connecting with anyone in this story on a human level. I guess that's  to make the CGI apes look more alive and seem multi-dimensional, but it slows down the pace of the film and keeps it from having the emotional impact it could have had. The scenes with the apes have the emotional impact they're supposed to, but the human actors aren't given what they need to work with. Rise of the Planet of the Apes really needed a human element to connect the viewer to the story and that heart and soul is missing from this film.Cinematically, the editing is absolutely horrible. I had to wonder if they hired Lee Daniels or Tyler Perry's editor, because the choppy transitions between scenes keep the film from flowing smoothly. Without those transitional scenes to bridge between events the progression of the story feels mechanical instead of organic.I feel like they built the story around the special effects instead of the story. Yeah, the CGI apes are amazing. They have the best scenes in the story. But the finished film feels incomplete, uneven and ends on a flat note.Rise of the Planet of the Apes didn't get a rise out of me.

The original film was also very good and it followed the story pretty closely. Another selling point was that women liked to see Charlton Heston's bare chest. To make a successful prequel movie about the events that caused the rise of the apes is even more impressive, and no humans (male of female) had to take their shirts off. Caesar (Andy Serkis) is the first simian to speak English fluently. He even speaks it better than his captors who like to taunt him. He gets bored sitting around in a cage all day, so he teaches his fellow apes to revolt in the hopes of achieving freedom, thus becoming their leader without an apparent election. Evolution is not the culprit in this film, instead it is caused by an experimental drug without any involvement from PETA, KFC, or Pamela Anderson.According to some sources, Serkis required some minor plastic surgery to alter his appearance for this film. The procedure was not as intensive due to his previous role in King Kong where he also played an ape, although he was much larger. The transition from Gollum to King Kong was much more problematic according to one of Michael Jackson's former plastic surgeons.Believe it or not, it's people like us who make the apes kill on the Golden Gate bridge. This whole mess could have been prevented if people had treated their pets better and had not put leashes around their necks.

That is very rare and speaks volumes to how good this movie is. And unlikeTim Burton's 2001 remakeofthe classic 1968 versionof Planet of the Apes, it's also good to see that the little criticism that has been placed on Rise is not from preservationists that just don't like their classics tampered with.Rise takes the liberty of creating the events leading up to how a planet...our planet...could be overrun by apes that suddenly are able to think (more) intelligently and begin to speak. And the movie's writers and director do an excellent job of weaving it all together in a believable way. James Franco is a scientist looking for the cure to Alzheimer's. His initial test subjects?...You guessed it, and what initially looks like a smashing success leads to the potential fall of man. The story is simple and easy to follow, very dissimilar to Tim Burton's time travel explanations in his 2001 attempt.While the star of the movie is billed as James Franco, who indeed does a fine job in his role, the real star of this movie is little credited motion capture actor Andy Serkis. Serkis is a little known name for most people, but you'd probably be surprised at how many times you've seen him in a movie...or should I say seen his motions and more importantly his facial expressions in movies. You see, the apes in this movie are computer generated which is why they look so much more real than the plastic looking apes in all of the previous Planet of the Apes movies. But what's misleading is that the Rise apes technically are not 100% computer generated; in many instances when the apes aren't swinging from place to place or jumping around the room, you are actually seeing computer generated images overlaid onto actual character actors. And Serkis is Caesar (Serkis was alsoKing Kongin Peter Jackson's 2005 remake of that film, and Serkis was Jackson's pick to play the diabolical Gollum in theThe Lord of the Rings Trilogy).As much as I loved the original movie that spawned 4 sequels, a television series and an animated TV series--and I was even one of the 6 people in the entire world that liked Burton's remake--I liked Rise of the Planet of the Apes the best.

I was never bored, but I was never totally captivated either.In part this may be because of the computer generated graphic apes. Personally I didn't find them realistic so I was a little less sucked in to the story. To compare, the CG in Avatar was so amazing that I lost track of the fact it WAS animation and thought of it as real throughout the movie. I can't say the same for the apes in this movie. Perhaps it was the smaller budget.I would say that I even preferred the costumes and makeup in the Mark Wahlberg version. It had more realism.If I could, I'd give this movie about 3 1/2 stars. It takes you to what would have been the very beginning of the planet of the apes series of movies and shows you how the apes originally got their smarts, and how things got to where they could end up ruling the earth.The movie with Mark Wahlberg tried to do this, but this movie went deeper into the ape's perspective, and took place on modern day earth.For the most part, I found the premise and the script to be feasable. I liked the way it gave a reasonable explanation for how this could be possible. The story was decent and as I said, it kept my attention. But when the movie was over, all we could say was ""it was okay"" and ""it was kinda entertaining"". But it won't be memorable or a favorite.John Lithgow was absolutely wonderful as usual. He's a great actor and we enjoy him in drama and comedy. Brian Cox was okay, but perhaps lacked depth.Ultimately I would recommend this movie for scifi fans, and those who have enjoyed the franchise. I just think you should go in with realistic expectations.Lastly, there were some parents with young kids in the movie theater. I don't feel this is a movie for kids.

Along for the ride were two visiting Canadians who had not seen any of the older or newer Apes movies.  Rise of the Planet of the Apes does fulfill its promise to explain the beginning of the Apes growing intelligence.  It stops where this embryonic tribe of apes moves into the forest and therefore, does not venture to how they became the dominant species over humans.  There is only a hint that the meds given to the apes is fatal to humans when breathed in.  Other than that foreshadowing, a new movie would have to show how the apes became dominant and humans reduced to slavery and living in the wild.After watching, it became my believe that for the two visitors who were not familiar with the Planet of the Apes mythology, it would have been better for them to have seen either the original Charlton Heston movie or the more recent remake with Mark Walhberg.That said, for me, the movie is capable of standing upon its own legs as a separate entity.  The video quality of the blu ray is very good tho I would not say outstanding but I could detect no artifacting and deep blacks were prominent.  The DTS audio was a bit disappointing for me as, with such an action movie, more use of the surrounds could have been improved even though the levels were just fine.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",4,Rise of the Planet of the Apes-Blu Ray,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,1688,"['watched', 'last', 'night', 'first', 'time', 'having', 'not', 'seen', 'theaters', 'ride', 'were', 'two', 'visiting', 'Canadians', 'who', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'older', 'newer', 'Apes', 'movies', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'fulfill', 'promise', 'explain', 'beginning', 'Apes', 'growing', 'intelligence', 'where', 'embryonic', 'tribe', 'apes', 'moves', 'forest', 'therefore', 'not', 'venture', 'how', 'became', 'dominant', 'species', 'humans', 'only', 'hint', 'meds', 'given', 'apes', 'fatal', 'humans', 'when', 'breathed', 'Other', 'foreshadowing', 'new', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'show', 'how', 'apes', 'became', 'dominant', 'humans', 'reduced', 'slavery', 'living', 'wild.After', 'watching', 'became', 'believe', 'two', 'visitors', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'familiar', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'mythology', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'movie', 'more', 'recent', 'remake', 'Mark', 'Walhberg.That', 'said', 'movie', 'capable', 'standing', 'own', 'legs', 'separate', 'entity', 'video', 'quality', 'blu', 'ray', 'very', 'good', 'tho', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'outstanding', 'could', 'detect', 'artifacting', 'deep', 'blacks', 'were', 'prominent', 'DTS', 'audio', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'action', 'movie', 'more', 'use', 'surrounds', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'even', 'levels', 'were', 'just', 'fine.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

Of course, he first tries it out on the chimpanzees in his company's laboratory, and one, called ""Bright Eyes"" (what the orangutan scientist called Charlton Heston in the original 1968 ""Planet of the Apes"" film) becomes very intelligent. Franco winds up taking this chimp's baby home and becomes his ""father.""

Once again, Hollywood proves that 1 good film idea deserves to be remade to death, and they did it again, here.Average storyline, well-executed CGI graphics, thinly acted, though I thought Mr. Franco (the lead) did a pretty good job emoting with the actor in the chimp suit.I live in California, and it was great seeing the Bay Area in another film other than Dirty Harry, Bullit, or a Rom-Com.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Issues with the Download version Vs. DVD/Blu-Ray which are available in stores now-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------The problem with this overall experience, though, was in the delivery, and the delivery pipe (DOWNLOAD) I give only 1 star:I have a VERY fast (over 29 MBps download) fiber-optic Comcast digital pipeline from Amazon's server to my TV.  So, when I elected to buy this film digitally, I thought I was doing something ""green"" and saving about $5 versus what the hard copy on DVD would cost.I was immediately struck by two shortcomings, once the film had downloaded to my TIVO from Amazon-First:  The QUALITY of the image was NOT up to snuff.  Grainy and not sharp as one would hope for, not even up to DVD quality, much less Blu-Ray.  This was a major irritant, considering today's technology and the fact that I own a 1080p television which is fully-capable of displaying blu-ray images.  My Sony DVD player automatically upscales DVD's to 1020p lines of vertical resolution, no such luck here though, as the image was playing back from my TIVO.Second:  NO CLOSED CAPTIONING.  This was the deal-breaker.  I have the hearing of a typical senior- POOR.  Without closed-captions, I miss about 50% or more of what's being said.  Simply playing the movie louder is no help.  My ears can't separate out the dialog from the sound effects, particularly because today's film makers have fallen in love with VERY LOUD background (this may be to compensate for weak scripts, yeah?) such as squealing tires, bombs, explosions, gunshots, and music.  The upshot?  Without closed captioning, I might as well watch Heidi.  No telling what the movie was about!I know about the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) - but apparently this federal law either doesn't apply to downloaded films or else no one at Amazon, Netflix, and other Online broadcast media purveyors has heard of the law.  That's wrong in so many ways.  Since the physical DVD has closed captioning in several different languages, I am buying this film on DVD.I am writing this with the hope that people with hearing issues give thought to this issue, and of course it wouldn't hurt if at some point the power players in media delivery took online streaming to the level where ""EVERYONE"" could enjoy the films, even those who have a hearing problem.  I think it will happen someday, and am aware of the fact that this probably means having double-copies of the given media up on the servers (one with no captions, one with English subtitles) and then there would be those who speak other languages who would have this issue as well.  Update:  Netflix streaming films viewed on your PC do offer a ""subtitles"" button - great!  Now, what about when viewing on Television set?It's easier to do nothing than to address the problem, and thus the issue persists.  Until then, I guess the obvious choice is to avoid downloading and purchase on physical media (DVD/Blu-Ray).",3,So-So Movie with great CGI but miserable picture/captioning via Download vs DVD/Blu-Ray,1324339200,"12 20, 2011",2011,3624,"['movie', 'Latest', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'saga', 'clearly', 'technology', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'available', 'back', 'early', 'days', 'when', ""'"", 'films', 'began', 'Once', 'again', 'Hollywood', '1', 'good', 'film', 'idea', 'be', 'remade', 'death', 'did', 'again', 'here.Average', 'storyline', 'well-executed', 'CGI', 'graphics', 'thinly', 'acted', 'thought', 'Mr.', 'Franco', 'lead', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'emoting', 'actor', 'chimp', 'suit.I', 'live', 'California', 'was', 'great', 'seeing', 'Bay', 'Area', 'film', 'other', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'Bullit', 'Rom-Com.', '-Issues', 'Download', 'version', 'Vs.', 'DVD/Blu-Ray', 'are', 'available', 'stores', 'now', '-The', 'problem', 'overall', 'experience', 'was', 'delivery', 'delivery', 'pipe', 'DOWNLOAD', 'give', 'only', '1', 'star', 'have', 'VERY', 'fast', '29', 'MBps', 'download', 'fiber-optic', 'Comcast', 'digital', 'pipeline', 'Amazon', 'server', 'TV', 'So', 'when', 'elected', 'buy', 'film', 'digitally', 'thought', 'was', 'doing', 'something', 'green', 'saving', '5', 'versus', 'what', 'hard', 'copy', 'DVD', 'would', 'cost.I', 'was', 'immediately', 'struck', 'two', 'shortcomings', 'once', 'film', 'had', 'downloaded', 'TIVO', 'Amazon-First', 'QUALITY', 'image', 'was', 'NOT', 'up', 'snuff', 'Grainy', 'not', 'sharp', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'not', 'even', 'DVD', 'quality', 'much', 'less', 'Blu-Ray', 'was', 'major', 'irritant', 'considering', 'today', 'technology', 'fact', 'own', '1080p', 'television', 'fully-capable', 'displaying', 'blu-ray', 'images', 'Sony', 'DVD', 'player', 'automatically', 'DVD', '1020p', 'lines', 'vertical', 'resolution', 'such', 'luck', 'here', 'though', 'image', 'was', 'playing', 'back', 'TIVO.Second', 'CLOSED', 'CAPTIONING', 'was', 'deal-breaker', 'have', 'hearing', 'typical', 'senior-', 'POOR', 'closed-captions', 'miss', '50', '%', 'more', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'Simply', 'playing', 'movie', 'louder', 'help', 'ears', 'ca', ""n't"", 'separate', 'out', 'dialog', 'sound', 'effects', 'particularly', 'today', 'film', 'makers', 'have', 'fallen', 'love', 'VERY', 'LOUD', 'background', 'may', 'be', 'compensate', 'weak', 'scripts', 'yeah', 'such', 'squealing', 'tires', 'bombs', 'explosions', 'gunshots', 'music', 'upshot', 'closed', 'captioning', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'watch', 'Heidi', 'telling', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'know', 'ADA', 'Americans', 'Disabilities', 'Act', 'apparently', 'federal', 'law', 'either', ""n't"", 'apply', 'downloaded', 'films', 'else', 'one', 'Amazon', 'Netflix', 'other', 'Online', 'broadcast', 'media', 'purveyors', 'heard', 'law', 'wrong', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'physical', 'DVD', 'closed', 'captioning', 'several', 'different', 'languages', 'am', 'buying', 'film', 'DVD.I', 'am', 'writing', 'hope', 'people', 'hearing', 'issues', 'give', 'thought', 'issue', 'course', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'point', 'power', 'players', 'media', 'delivery', 'took', 'online', 'streaming', 'level', 'where', 'EVERYONE', 'could', 'enjoy', 'films', 'even', 'who', 'have', 'hearing', 'problem', 'think', 'will', 'happen', 'someday', 'am', 'aware', 'fact', 'probably', 'having', 'double-copies', 'given', 'media', 'up', 'servers', 'one', 'captions', 'one', 'English', 'subtitles', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'who', 'speak', 'other', 'languages', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'issue', 'as', 'well', 'Update', 'Netflix', 'streaming', 'films', 'viewed', 'PC', 'do', 'offer', 'subtitles', 'button', 'great', 'Now', 'what', 'when', 'viewing', 'Television', 'set', 'easier', 'do', 'nothing', 'address', 'problem', 'thus', 'issue', 'then', 'guess', 'obvious', 'choice', 'avoid', 'downloading', 'purchase', 'physical', 'media', 'DVD/Blu-Ray']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

The movie never takes us to that point. This movie begs for a comparison to the original series as they borrow lines from it. I enjoy this aspect of remakes, but if you have never seen the original you may not be hip to them. The first thing I caught was the first chimp was called ""bright eyes"" a nicknamed the apes gave to Charlton Heston. The chimp's subsequent escape was similar to the one by Heston. Caesar was the name of the smart ape in the POTA series and likewise his first ever spoken word was ""no."" A hose was used to punish the ape like it was used on Heston. Two of Heston's lines were spoken by the ""jailer."" ""It's a madhouse!"" and ""Take your sticking paws off me you..."" James Franciscus played in Beneath the Planet of the Apes and James Franco starred in this one and the movie is set in San Francisco. (I am running out of similarities.)In the original series apes were bred to be pets because a virus had wiped out dogs and cats. This movie uses a virus to make apes smart. Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) plays an excellent ""Sean Penn"" sadistic punk ""jailer"" who we all want to see die. (Forgive me, but I think he can act better than Radcliffe.) James Franco and Frieda Pinto were less stellar in their starring roles than was Heston or McDowell. Of course if they wrote them some decent lines...The apes in this, from what I could tell, were CG and not as life-like as British actors with make-up. The CG baby chimp was perhaps the worst of the lot. Fortunately that didn't last but a few minutes in movie time. During the ape-human conflicts I thought a hip-hop/rap soundtrack i.e. ""stick it to the man"" type of music would have worked better, (I was humming Eminem) although the producers were most likely afraid of a possible back lash.The movie was good, but the rave reviews are hyped. Four and a half stars at the most.No f-bombs, no sex, no nudity, no ape privates showing, no blood splattering, no Linda Harrison running around in a loin cloth.

Will learns that a new gene therapy drug, originally developed to cure Alzheimer's disease, has enhanced the intelligence level of the chimpanzee the drug is given.Being a reboot of the series, the new film ignores some of the aspects of the Charlton Heston classic made in 1968 (especially political elements).

I was initially willing to do that because a true-life similar idea--the genetic modification in our food supply--is very much part of the public consciousness today. Is it that far off to suggest that in the near future, scientists might develop some kind of retrovirus that will alter the genetic makeup of advanced mammals, such as both chimps and humans alike? While the whole idea of chimps becoming intelligent as humans is far-fetched, the possibility still bears some relationship to a set of plausible, scientific ideas.In its simplistic way, 'Apes' is a cautionary tale that points to the limits of scientific knowledge. Will Rodman's retrovirus initially cures his father of Alzheimer's disease but eventually it proves to be a complete failure. Even worse, the virus ends up infecting all of humanity and the apes eventually take over. The desire for profits outweighs safety concerns involving scientific research. How many times have we seen that?Unfortunately, the suspension of one's disbelief happens one too many times throughout this film. Take for example the opening scene where the female chimpanzee 'Bright Eyes' goes on a rampage, in an attempt to protect her baby (later adopted by Rodman and named 'Caesar', consistent with the earlier Planet of the Ape storyline.) It's curious that none of the scientists at the laboratory noticed Bright Eyes was pregnant. More unbelievable is that Jacobs, Rodman's boss, doesn't fire him on the spot as he is responsible for Bright Eyes' mayhem and the obvious bad publicity engendered by the crazed chimpanzee's rampage.Another aspect of the film I had trouble accepting was that no one got wind of Caesar during the three years he was living with Rodman at his house. Given the chimp's growth and curiosity, I would have thought that Rodman and his girlfriend could have hardly kept him locked up in the house all that time. When they do go to see the Redwoods, at a major tourist spot, there are few people there and only one person there notes that a chimpanzee is present. I doubt Rodman would have escaped the scrutiny of a park ranger who could have easily been notified via cellphone by anyone horrified to see a chimpanzee being led around on a leash.Another awkward moment was the fight between the nasty neighbor and Rodman's Alzheimer's afflicted father. Why was the neighbor such a nasty character to begin with? Rodman could have easily took him aside when he moved in and mentioned that his father had Alzheimer's. That way he would not have reacted the way he did when the father got inside his car and started wrecking it!Perhaps the most unbelievable moments in the film is when Rodman's boss suddenly reverses his decision to fund Rodman's experiments a second time around. You remember how vehement he was in shutting the over eager neuroscientist down the first time around? Not only that, Jacobs made it quite clear that Rodman was in the doghouse since the Bright Eyes fiasco. But all of a sudden, he's willing to back him merely on Rodman's assertions that the retrovirus had worked on his father, temporarily!!! No proof whatsoever--Jacobs suddenly believes Rodman, merely upon his word and nothing else!'Apes' really goes 'ape' when Caesar 'sprays' his fellow simian crew and they now have the ability to break out of the primate facility where they've been imprisoned. How is it that the chimps and apes they release from the San Francisco Zoo (who were NOT sprayed with the virus) are able to join the team of intelligent simians, and successfully defeat their human opponents? In a big city such as San Francisco, it sure seemed like there were a lot more apes available for combat than would have been available in reality. And where was the Army for that matter? This would have been a major news event and certainly wouldn't have been left to the local police force. More incredible is that the simian rampage is never shown as a breaking news story in any media, local or national.It appears that the films' scenarists attempt to justify the 'revolt' of the apes as they are depicted as being victims of unethical scientists allied with rapacious businessmen as well as gamekeepers guilty of animal cruelty. Humans get short shrift here and only Rodman, his girlfriend and Rodman's temporarily aware Dad (sans the Alzheimers), appear to have some kind of moral conscience. In this light, one sees that most of the characters here are pretty one-dimensional.Finally, 'Apes' gets pretty lazy in finding a way to dispose of most of humanity, which will explain the rise of the simians. It's simply your basic 'contagion', where a virus leads to nosebleeds and the implied demise of millions. Somehow, I wanted something a little more clever than such a trite explanation explaining the end of humans' dominion over the animal kingdom.'Apes' does well in the CGI department and despite the hokey storyline, keeps your interest. Perhaps the best moments involve Rodman's bonding with Caesar as he grows up. I only wish the screenwriters tried to make things a bit more plausible. Even science fiction must have some credibility if it's going to work at all!",2,'Apes' causes you to suspend your disbelief one too many times,1313625600,"08 18, 2011",2011,5323,"['***', 'review',

1415899,A3373I4II32NA1,B004LWZW4M,Tyler,"[2, 2]","Just finished watching this movie ten minutes ago. Must post about it while the movie is still fresh!!! The movie is completely awesome!I suppose we all remember watching Mark Wahlberg and his role in the first of recent Planet of the Apes, and where the ending is like, ""How the hell did all those apes show up with police cars and what the hell happened to the humans if he landed safely on THE planet Earth? Well, this movie kinda explains how it happened.The other reviews go deep into one of the apes dying in the lab and how James Franco takes a baby ape home and how it grows up at his house with extreme intelligence while Franco is testing out a drug that can somehow help cure Alzheimers which his father has. But here is what didn't seem to be explained. The new ape, Caesar, is taken away by Animal Control after he manhandles a neighbor that was going after John Lithgow(playing Franco's father)because Lithgow in the throes of Alzheimers, accidentally takes the neighbor's Mustang and rams it between two parked cars while trying to drive away. Franco is desperate to get his chimp out of the Animal Control prison and Caesar grows more bitter and angry as time goes by, so by the time Franco is finally able to free him, Caesar refuses to leave, instead preferring to bust out with his army of apes and chimps after they have a go at the guard, which I had no idea played Draco Malfoy in Harry Potter, than busting out other captive chimps at the lab and the zoo and moving through downtown San Francisco.I thought that the apes would lay waste to the entire city somehow and take out their revenge on humans, but Caesar seems content to not have his small army, which is anywhere from 300 to 500, attack anyone who doesn't deserve it. The battleground between apes and humans is played out along the Golden Gate Bridge, where the apes battle the police and state troopers and do it quite successfully. To avoid being shot down like fish in a barrel, the apes maneuver around the wires holding the bridge and the metal structure underneath, push an overturned bus as cover against a defense line of over 50 cops, and then OVERRUN the entire police line with lightning speed. The cops never had a chance against this kind of fight! It leaves you riveted and wanting to see more, especially when one large ape sacrifices himself in taking out a helicopter, but all THIS just so they can make a new home in the forest outside the city that Caesar recognizes from his earlier visits with Franco??? I'm kinda wondering about what kind of end that was until a part is shown in the closing credits.A scene in the movie shows that one of the scientists falls prey to a virus that was developed in the lab, part of the virus that supposedly brought intelligence to apes, and is found dead in his residence after he sneezes his germs on an alarmed neighbor. In the closing credits, this neighbor of his turns out to be an airline pilot that is starting to come down with it in the airport, and he brings that infection to Paris, which gets sent to Africa, Asia, and so forth. I would've liked to see some ending scenes with that virus bringing down the world, but the disease trails lighting up every continent on a global map of the Earth shows proof enough.My only complaint is that the movie didn't last longer than it's intended 1 hour and 45 minutes. It seems like it's a movie that requires much further detail that could've been brought into it and how the world further came to an end of it's human population, but it's still good for my 5 stars!",5,Absolutely thrilling!,1324425600,"12 21, 2011",2011,3559,"['Just', 'finished', 'watching', 'movie', 'ten', 'minutes', 'ago', 'Must', 'post', 'movie', 'still', 'fresh', 'movie', 'completely', 'awesome', 'suppose', 'remember', 'watching', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'role', 'first', 'recent', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'where', 'ending', 'How', 'hell', 'did', 'apes', 'show', 'up', 'police', 'cars', 'what', 'hell', 'happened', 'humans', 'landed', 'safely', 'THE', 'planet', 'Earth', 'Well', 'movie', 'kinda', 'how', 'other', 'reviews', 'go', 'deep', 'one', 'apes', 'dying', 'lab', 'how', 'James', 'Franco', 'baby', 'ape', 'home', 'how', 'up', 'house', 'extreme', 'intelligence', 'Franco', 'testing', 'out', 'drug', 'can', 'somehow', 'help', 'cure', 'Alzheimers', 'father', 'here', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'explained', 'new', 'ape', 'Caesar', 'taken', 'away', 'Animal', 'Control', 'neighbor', 'was', 'going', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'playing', 'Franco', 'father', 'Lithgow', 'throes', 'Alzheimers', 'accidentally', 'neighbor', 'Mustang', 'rams', 'two', 'parked', 'cars', 'trying', 'drive', 'away', 'Franco', 'desperate', 'get', 'chimp', 'Animal', 'Control', 'prison', 'Caesar', 'more', 'bitter', 'angry', 'time', 'so', 'time', 'Franco', 'finally', 'able', 'free', 'Caesar', 'leave', 'instead', 'preferring', 'bust', 'out', 'army', 'apes', 'chimps', 'have', 'go', 'guard', 'had', 'idea', 'played', 'Draco', 'Malfoy', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'busting', 'out', 'other', 'captive', 'chimps', 'lab', 'zoo', 'moving', 'downtown', 'San', 'Francisco.I', 'thought', 'apes', 'would', 'lay', 'waste', 'entire', 'city', 'somehow', 'take', 'out', 'revenge', 'humans', 'Caesar', 'content', 'not', 'have', 'small', 'army', 'anywhere', '300', '500', 'attack', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'battleground', 'apes', 'humans', 'played', 'out', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'where', 'apes', 'battle', 'police', 'state', 'troopers', 'do', 'quite', 'successfully', 'avoid', 'being', 'shot', 'fish', 'barrel', 'apes', 'wires', 'holding', 'bridge', 'metal', 'structure', 'underneath', 'push', 'overturned', 'bus', 'cover', 'defense', 'line', '50', 'cops', 'then', 'OVERRUN', 'entire', 'police', 'line', 'lightning', 'speed', 'cops', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'kind', 'fight', 'riveted', 'wanting', 'see', 'more', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'large', 'ape', 'sacrifices', 'taking', 'out', 'helicopter', 'THIS', 'just', 'so', 'can', 'make', 'new', 'home', 'forest', 'city', 'Caesar', 'earlier', 'visits', 'Franco', ""'m"", 'kinda', 'wondering', 'what', 'kind', 'end', 'was', 'part', 'shown', 'closing', 'credits.A', 'scene', 'movie', 'one', 'scientists', 'prey', 'virus', 'was', 'developed', 'lab', 'part', 'virus', 'supposedly', 'brought', 'intelligence', 'apes', 'found', 'dead', 'residence', 'germs', 'alarmed', 'neighbor', 'closing', 'credits', 'neighbor', 'turns', 'out', 'be', 'airline', 'pilot', 'starting', 'come', 'down', 'airport', 'infection', 'Paris', 'sent', 'Africa', 'Asia', 'so', 'forth', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'see', 'ending', 'scenes', 'virus', 'bringing', 'down', 'world', 'disease', 'lighting', 'up', 'continent', 'global', 'map', 'Earth', 'proof', 'only', 'complaint', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'longer', 'intended', '1', 'hour', '45', 'minutes', 'movie', 'much', 'further', 'detail', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'brought', 'how', 'world', 'further', 'came', 'end', 'human', 'population', 'still', 'good', '5', 'stars']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes
1415900,A3UXUI758GU7OL,B004LWZW4M,Victor Spoils,"[2, 4]","Rise of the Planet of the ApesI've never been a Trekkie, or a hardcore Star Wars fan, although I enjoy both. I'm neither into the Harry Potter series, nor the Lord of the Rings ... although I do enjoy watching the series with my two boys. What I am and always have been, is a true to the bone Planet of the Apes fan. I love all five original films...even the weaker ones. If I were to choose my favorite, it would be the 1968 original film starring Charlton Heston. Heston plays Taylor, a bitter misanthropic, an explorer in space in search of ""something better than man."" When Taylor and crew bounce through a time warp and crash land on what seems like a desolate planet, they soon discover that apes are the supreme race, while mute humans are the savages. Befriended by two chimps, Cornelius and Dr. Zira, the three makes their way to the Forbidden Zone where Taylor discovers the half-buried remains of the Statue of Liberty. Taylor realizes that he has been on earth all along, 2000 years in the future. For it's time a very shocking ending and even today it still plays well. If it all sounds like an extended Twilight Zone episode, well then I guess it was because the original screenplay was penned by Rod Serling. Beneath the Planet of the Apes, second film, premiered in 1970 and I couldn't race to the theatre fast enough to see this. In this chapter, Astronaut Brent, played by James Franciscus, is in hot pursuit of the lost spacecraft, Icarus, manned by Colonel Taylor. Following Taylor's flight path, Brent soon finds himself on the Planet of Apes. Much of the first half of the film plays out like the original with Brent making much of the same discoveries. The later half of the film takes a drastic turn as Brent discovers the remaining survivors of the human race living in a sub city beneath the earth. It is here where the apes military force, lead by General Ursus, are headed. It is also here where Brent finds an imprisoned Taylor. As the apes gain entry into the underground city, an ensuing battle breaks out. As war wages, Brent and Taylor make their way to the cities main cathedral where an atomic bomb stands. After Brent is killed and Taylor critically wounded by General Ursus, played by James Gregory in a rousing performance, Taylor engages the bomb and the screen fades to white. When Heston blew up the world putting an end to ""this upside down civilization"", there I sat, in my seat, mouth agape, popcorn kernels spread across my lap. I was hooked like I've never been hooked on anything in my young life before. My little friend, Jimmy Smith, and me made it our young life's mission to see both films as many times as we could. It wasn't an easy task either, because there weren't any VCR or DVD players in those days. We racked up 20 viewings of the Heston original and 17 viewings of its popular sequel just by going to the movie theatre. 20th Century Fox made it easier on a kid trying to stretch his movie buck by re-releasing them TOGETHER, billed as ""Back by Popular Demand!"" We were in ape heaven. Then something happened, something unforeseen to this 11-year-olds young mind. A third movie premiered in 1971, Escape from the Planet of the Apes. What? More apes? How could this be? The world was destroyed, blew up at the hands of Colonel Taylor by mans man-made atomic bomb. It was all too much for this kids mind to comprehend. All I could do was slap down my movie buck and see for myself. Writer, Paul Dehn, who wrote the one sequel and the following three prequels, was given the job by 20th Century Fox to come up with a believable story line to keep the series alive. Keeping in mind with his already destruction of the world, his task was to take the apes back in time. To the present, to the period before the revolution of the apes. Thus, Dr. Zira and her husband, Cornelius are joined by ape scientist Dr. Milo who has salvaged Colonel Taylor's' spaceship and launches it into orbit just before the destruction of the earth. The apes bounce through the same time warp, which brought Astronauts Taylor and crew to the future, only to return the apes back to the past. In this chapter Dehn writes for laughs only to deliver a tragic blow at the end of the film. An ending I found hard to shake as a kid. The following year 20th Century Fox brought us Conquest of the Planet of the Apes. Child Chimp of Dr. Zira and Cornelius, Cesar, has grown into adulthood and it is in this chapter that Cesar leads the apes to revolt and take control of Los Angeles. This is the story line that ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" follows. ""The final Chapter"" as billed is Battle for the Planet of the Apes released 1973. In this fifth and final installment. Cesar and apes control all of mankind. While Battle is the weakest of the series, it does offer another fine performance by Roddy McDowell, not the tour de force he delivers in Conquest, but still a commanding performance. Twenty three years later Tim Burton would release his ""re-imagining"" of Planet of the Apes. While by far the biggest disappointment of all the ape films, the movie does have a stand out performance by Tim Roth and General Thade and a wonderful cameo by Charlton Heston as Zauis, Thades father. This brings me to the 2011 release ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes."" I, myself, am old school when it comes to Prosthetics vs. CGI. A big part of my love for the films is the make up. Ground breaking it was for 1968. When I learned that the new release would offer only CGI monkeys I was quickly skeptical and very disappointed, that is until I heard that Andy Sirkis would play the role of Cesar and then I caught a glimpse of the trailer some months back. Wow, this looks damn good, I thought. Looks like a remake of Conquest. Interesting, Conquest is one of my favorites of the series. Good God, I gotta wait until August! The excitement mounted. I quickly exchanged a couple facebook messages with my ole ape-pal, Jim Smith. He was looking forward to the release to, but like myself, harbored some doubt. His exact words were something like: I am suspended somewhere between excited anticipation and a dreaded expectation of almost certain disappointment. On August 4th 2011, some 43 years after I sat next to pal Jimmy, in an old dingy theatre, The Broadway, on fourth street in Santa Ana. The lights dimmed, the curtain rose. My son Jake, to my left, my other boy, Vince was to my right. I took in a deep breath...and off I went. Being a fifty year old man, I couldn't help but feel a little bit like a kid again. I couldn't believe I was about to watch another Planet of the Apes film! Not to reveal too many spoilers on the film, I will say that no expense was spared. Time and care was taken to put out a great film. Something 20th Century Fox stopped doing after the 1968 original. Every movie that followed (Beneath, Escape, Conquest, Battle) experienced budget cuts from pre-production on through post-production. The work of actor Andy Sirkis and the CGI effects crew work well in bringing Cesar to life. You can see the emotion in Cesar's eyes. You can feel his pain and confusion, you can sense his fear at the hands of the gate keepers at the Ape Sanctuary where Cesar inevitably ends up. You can understand his mounting hatred and distrust of mankind. When Cesar makes the decision to rise up and lead the apes on to revolt and break free of their prison we as audience members trust and believe in him. We root for him. The battle on the Golden Gate Bridge is spectacular. I found myself getting caught up, becoming emotional as the apes outfox the police. As low clouds settle on the bridge, obstructing the apes view of an almost certain ambush, Cesar sends out his army up above the cables of the bridge and below the bridge structure, as apes advance and hold their position Cesar and the remaining apes advance forward at full speed. It is an awesome, thrilling, spectacular battle. One soon never forgotten. As the final credits roll, I was thankful that this new film will surely rejuvenate an old beloved movie franchise from the past. Rise of the Planet of the Apes pays a lot of homage to the original. If you make a comparison of the Rise cast list with the original cast list you will see many names of original characters and actors/producers are used in this latest version. Even the addition of Charlton Heston's face playing on a TV screen paints the background of a scene as well as the blast off of the spacecraft Icarus is caught on it's launch and latter in the film to be learned that the space probe has lost contact with earth. Setting up a sure remake of the original film. My fingers are crossed as I wait in excited anticipation!On the Victor scale of 1 through 5, 5 being best I rate the follow ape movies like so:Planet of the Apes - 5Beneath the Planet of the Apes -

1415903,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B004LWZW4M,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[2, 3]","""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" takes as its inspiration the fourth film of the original film series but goes in a very different direction all its own.SPOILERS:James Franco plays Will Rodman who invents a genetically engineered virus that treats the brain growing synaptic tissue. He's losing his race against the disease as it claims his own father Charles(John Lithgow). Forced to adopt the baby chimp of one of his chimp test subjects, Rodman finds that the ""cure"" has been genetically passed along to Caesar (Andy Serkis in a motion capture performance). Caesar demonstrates the intelligence of a human.When Caesar defends Charles from a neighbor, he finds himself condemned to a primate sanctuary with other chimps, gorillas and orangutans. Although he's initially rejected by his own kind, Caesar later begins to identify with the other primates and determines to make them like him and rise up against humanity.END OF SPOILERS:Director Rubert Wyatt (""The Escapist"")does a nice job of keeping the action moving while allowing the characters to develop within the context of what is, essentially, a science fiction thriller. The script by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (""The Relic"" and ""An Eye for an Eye"")cleverly incorporates many of the themes from the original ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"" as well as bits of dialogue and even characters named after the people that worked on the original ""Planet of the Apes"" (""Franklin"" after original film director Franklin J. Schaffner, ""Jacobs"" after producer Arthur P. Jacobs, ""Dodge"" after one of the characters in the original film, ""Maurice"" after actor Maurice Evans, etc.). All of those tributes would be meaningless if the film wasn't entertaining but, luckily, it is and without being heavy handed does raise some issues without derailing the film.Although the film is flawed (there are some plot holes and bits of illogical action that occurs in the film that can be overlooked if you buy into the premise of the film), ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is an exceptional attempt to revitalize the franchise. The writers cleverly set up a number of sequels including one for a ""Planet of the Apes"" reboot involving a very minor subplot mentioned about a mission to Mars that mysterious vanishes.""Rise"" will entertain you and won't leave the bad taste in your mouth that Tim Burton's poorly thought out and directed remake did (and you can pretend it doesn't exist--it doesn't tie in to THAT film at all thankfully!).Recommended.",4,Reboot that wisely ignores the Tim Burton remake,1313366400,"08 15, 2011",2011,2492,"['Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'inspiration', 'fourth', 'film', 'original', 'film', 'series', 'very', 'different', 'direction', 'own.SPOILERS', 'James', 'Franco', 'plays', 'Will', 'Rodman', 'who', 'genetically', 'engineered', 'virus', 'brain', 'growing', 'synaptic', 'tissue', 'losing', 'race', 'disease', 'own', 'father', 'Charles', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Forced', 'adopt', 'baby', 'chimp', 'one', 'chimp', 'test', 'subjects', 'Rodman', 'cure', 'been', 'genetically', 'passed', 'Caesar', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'motion', 'capture', 'performance', 'Caesar', 'intelligence', 'human.When', 'Caesar', 'Charles', 'neighbor', 'condemned', 'primate', 'sanctuary', 'other', 'chimps', 'gorillas', 'orangutans', 'initially', 'rejected', 'own', 'kind', 'Caesar', 'later', 'identify', 'other', 'primates', 'determines', 'make', 'rise', 'up', 'humanity.END', 'SPOILERS', 'Director', 'Rubert', 'Wyatt', 'Escapist', 'nice', 'job', 'keeping', 'action', 'moving', 'allowing', 'characters', 'develop', 'context', 'what', 'essentially', 'science', 'fiction', 'thriller', 'script', 'Rick', 'Jaffa', 'Amanda', 'Silver', 'Relic', 'Eye', 'Eye', 'cleverly', 'many', 'themes', 'original', 'Conquest', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'as', 'well', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'even', 'characters', 'named', 'people', 'worked', 'original', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Franklin', 'original', 'film', 'director', 'Franklin', 'J.', 'Schaffner', 'Jacobs', 'producer', 'Arthur', 'P.', 'Jacobs', 'Dodge', 'one', 'characters', 'original', 'film', 'Maurice', 'actor', 'Maurice', 'Evans', 'etc.', 'tributes', 'would', 'be', 'meaningless', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'luckily', 'being', 'heavy', 'handed', 'raise', 'issues', 'derailing', 'film.Although', 'film', 'flawed', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'bits', 'illogical', 'action', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'buy', 'premise', 'film', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'exceptional', 'attempt', 'revitalize', 'franchise', 'writers', 'cleverly', 'set', 'up', 'number', 'sequels', 'including', 'one', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'reboot', 'involving', 'very', 'minor', 'subplot', 'mentioned', 'mission', 'Mars', 'mysterious', 'vanishes', 'Rise', 'will', 'entertain', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'poorly', 'thought', 'out', 'directed', 'remake', 'did', 'can', 'pretend', ""n't"", 'exist', ""n't"", 'tie', 'film', 'thankfully', '.Recommended']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes

1415907,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B004LWZW4M,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[14, 21]","Rise of the Planet of the Apes is, in a word, amazing. But more on that later. I can't say that it's a perfect film. There is the occasional plot hole to be jumped here, a suspension of disbelief required there. But that aside, Rise succeeds on just about every level imaginable:  well written by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, well directed by Rupert Wyatt, with excellent performances from its cast, Rise is thoroughly engaging from beginning to end.Will Rodman (James Franco) is a research bio-engineer at GenSys, a genetic therapy pharmaceutical company, working hard on a virus which he hopes will be a cure for Alzheimers. Will's research has centered on a new drug - ALZ-112 - designed to enable neurogenesis, allowing the brain to grow new cells. The drug has shown highly promising results in one of their test subjects, a female ape nicknamed Bright Eyes who has shown a remarkable increase in intelligence after having been given the drug. Will tells his boss, Jacobs (David Oyelowo) about their progress, pushing hard for the next step: human trials. As we find out later, Will has personal reasons for wanting a cure found; his father, Charles Rodman (John Lithgow) is in the early stages of the disease but already needs a caretaker to look after him when Will is away at work.The day Will and Jacobs are to do their presentation to the GenSys board, however, things go horribly wrong. Bright Eyes goes inexplicably berserk and ends up being shot down in the conference room, dooming any chance Will had for human trials.  Jacobs orders all of the test apes treated with the drug to be put down. The task falls to the senior ape caretaker Robert Franklin (Tyler Labine), who in the process of putting the apes down makes a startling discovery: a baby ape hidden in Bright Eye's pen. Apparently she had just given birth, the real reason for her aggressive reaction. He takes the infant ape to Will, saying he can't bring himself to put it down and leaves it with Will, who reluctantly takes it home with him.  There his father immediately finds delight in the new arrival, naming it Caesar out of his fondness for Shakespeare.Time passes, and Caesar grows up in the Rodman household, displaying advanced intelligence for an ape which extends to his being able to learn a remarkable amount of sign language and express fairly complex thoughts. The trouble begins as Caesar gets older, sensing that he is different but unable to understand why or just how much he is different. And sensing that the world is a much bigger place than the confines of the Rodman house. A series of incidents result in Caesar being taken to a primate sanctuary specially tailored for handling apes who have either outgrown their owners or else have ended up being abandoned by circuses and zoos that have fallen on hard times. The sanctuary is run by John Landon (Brian Cox) with the care of the apes handled by his bullying son Dodge (Tom Felton) and another worker named Rodney (Jamie Harris). It is there that Caesar begins to brood on just how wrong everything happening to him is. And decides to do something about it.It's best if I don't say too much more about the plot as it is from this point on that Rise really moves into high gear. The scenes in the sanctuary are remarkably well written and it is fascinating to watch as Caesar begins to slowly but methodically take over and plan not only his own escape but the escape of all the primates.There are, as one would expect, a number of nods to the original Planet of the Apes film scattered throughout Rise, some of them blatantly obvious, some subtle and tucked away in the background. You don't need to have seen the original, but if you have it is fun to see just how many of these nods you can spot.  There are also a couple of clever nods to films like Spartacus and The Ten Commandments, which are quite appropriate given the storyline themes of rebellion and escape.The cast is overall quite good, with two standout performances and one somewhat questionable choice.  James Franco is suitably earnest as the scientist son wanting to save his dad from Alzheimers.  Freida Pinto is quite believable as the zoo veterinarian who ends up treating Caesar after an injury becomes Franco's love interest even as she warns him that he won't be able to keep Caesar forever. David Oyelowo's Jacobs is perfect as the director of GenSys whose only interest in ALZ-112 is its profit potential. And Brian Cox's Landon is subtly effective as the sanctuary owner, all geniality and compassion when Caesar is first brought in but shifting into impatient indifference and venality once the papers have been signed.The only questionable choice is Tom Felton, best known as Draco Malfoy from the Harry Potter films. Not that he does a bad job as Dodge, mind you.  It's just that the moment you see him, you just know what kind of an animal caretaker he's going to be. Not the best choice, either for the movie or for Felton's career, assuming he wants to escape being stereotyped. (Speaking of which, sadistic animal caretakers have become such a movie cliche, it's like its a job requirement. Want to take care of animals? Are you sadist? You're hired!)Rise's two standout performances however belong to Lithgow and Serkis. John Lithgow is truly moving as Franco's Alzheimers-stricken father, giving the film some of its most poignant moments, which anyone who's ever had a parent or loved one with Alzheimers will relate to. And Andy Serkis' Caesar is simply amazing and is the biggest reason why people should see Rise beyond the fact that it's a really good movie. For most of the film, Serkis can only communicate with his body language, his face and above all his eyes, but he proves more than adequate to the task. You look into Caesar's eyes and you see the intelligence - and more importantly - the awareness growing in him, along with all of the emotions that intelligence and awareness give birth to.Most people who have heard of Serkis will know him as the man behind the CGI-layered Gollum from the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which was already a remarkable achievement. Rise takes what they did in LotR up a notch as we watch evolution in action as Caesar progresses in development. They may just have to create a new category of Oscar for characters like this that combine the actor's abilities with those of CGI technologists, animal handlers, stuntmen and other aspects of the film profession to bring about a fully-realized creation born of the imagination - Caesar - made fully believable to the eye and mind. And this extends to the other ape characters in the film as well, all given special life by this combination of skills and technology. If LotR was the dawn of this new technique, in Rise you will witness the culmination of something that will undoubtedly affect the future of film-making as we know it.Highly, highly recommended to anyone who enjoys well thought out sci-fi or good engaging summer movies, and to anyone who wants to see just how far the envelope of special effects characters has truly been pushed.",5,Well written

(Does anyone remember the 2001 remake? No? That's what I mean.) For once, the classic is safe. This movie stays safely away from the original. At the same time, though, they provide not only reason for several species of intelligent apes to arise, but also reason for humankind to make way for them. And, if you remember the original, it gave reason to think that succession took place in a relatively short time, not the millions of years evolutionary dawdling you might have expected. This movie covers that, too.If you look at the pieces that make this up, they seem well-worn. There's the scientist working with iconically scary bio-thingie of the day. (Ditto lots of great storied from Mary Shelley's, through the atomic mutants of the 1950s, on up to genetically engineered viruses of today.)There's the dire warning about forces that can not (and ought not) be controlled. There's the big, bad corporate profit motive, when all the scientist wants to do is help people. The hubristic attempt to quell the uprising seriously underestimates the opponent, as might be expected. And, through it all, Caesar maintains some veneer of non-violence. Tom Felton, doing another ""I want to slap him"" role with his usual skill, really counts as self-inflicted. Outside of that (and leading the bloody escape), Caesar either avoids or actively deters most other violence.Think of a chef, though, who can take ordinary ingredients and blend them into a masterful dish. That kind of skill, with the help of a beefy CGI budget, displays itself here. Each of the apes appears as unique and largely convincing, but more impoortantly projects a unique personality.

1415920,AP3B615GM191G,B004LWZW4M,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[6, 9]","In the original ""Apes"" films, the one aspect of those movies that could legitimately be improved upon is the special effects and ape character presentation.  Though the outlandish ape costumes were state-of-the-art in their day and give those films part of their homely touch, today's CGI can bring so much more ""realism"" to science fiction scenes that could never have been dreamed of 40-50 years ago.  ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" does just that, but unfortunately gets pretty much everything else wrong.For a basic plot summary, ""Rise"" focuses on two ""individuals"": Will Rodman (James Franco), a scientist developing a cure for Alzheimer's disease who discovers that its effect on apes is extraordinary.  One ape in particular, Ceasar, gains such increased intelligence from the experimental drug that he leads his fellow simians in a revolt against the humans keeping them in captivity.As I previously mentioned, the special effects are the hallmark of this flick.  Whereas the ""Apes"" of yesteryear (especially the late sequels) struggle to visually depict an ape rebellion, ""Rise"" nails that scenario and makes it impressive to behold.The main problem holding ""Rise"" back, though, is the acting (or lack thereof) from the humans in the film.  James Franco is utterly uninspiring and wooden in what needed to be a key role, and that malaise seemed to trickle down through the auxiliary cast members.  By the end of the viewing, I didn't care whatsoever about the human element, instead getting antsy to just see more ""ape stuff"".Also, in referencing the ""Apes"" cannon, ""Rise"" is so-so.  Some lines/moments are epic and true to form, while other plot points stray far away from the established material (for better or worse).Thus, I consider ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" to be a decent re-imagining of the chronological beginning of the ""Apes"" saga.

I hoped I would not be disappointed. I wasn't.This is a prequel to the original Planet of the Apes done way back in 1968. It tells how the decline and devolution of humankind came to be. In trying to improve human lives, apes were experimented on and things went terribly wrong; or right; depending on how you look at it.The CGI is the best ever; especially with the close ups of the apes. I will say that in the ape crowd scenes the apes moved much like the crowd scenes in video games; Identical to each other although slightly out of sinc.The facial expressions on Cesar were superb and very human, but not too human. I could tell, though that Cesar, the hero of the movie looked very much like the Gulum around the eyes. In other scenes he resembled the Hulk. I didn't check which studio created these effects but I am guessing they are the same one.The humans were not all the stereotypical comic bad guys. They had different motives, even though they all amounted to the same mistreatment of intelligent animals. Even Cesar's &#34;adopted father&#34; treated him like a pet.Look for hints and links to the original movie such as famous lines and familiar names. Just showing how history repeats itself and turn about is fair play.I rooted for the apes.",5,A fun and thrilling ride,1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,1395,"['did', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'had', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'So', 'when', 'was', 'offered', 'Amazon', 'was', 'thrilled', 'hoped', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', ""wasn't.This"", 'prequel', 'original', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'done', 'way', 'back', '1968', 'how', 'decline', 'devolution', 'humankind', 'came', 'be', 'trying', 'improve', 'human', 'lives', 'apes', 'were', 'experimented', 'things', 'went', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'right', 'depending', 'how', 'look', 'it.The', 'CGI', 'best', 'ever', 'especially', 'close', 'ups', 'apes', 'will', 'say', 'ape', 'crowd', 'apes', 'moved', 'much', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'video', 'games', 'Identical', 'other', 'slightly', 'sinc.The', 'facial', 'expressions', 'Cesar', 'were', 'superb', 'very', 'human', 'not', 'too', 'human', 'could', 'tell', 'Cesar', 'hero', 'movie', 'looked', 'very', 'much', 'Gulum', 'eyes', 'other', 'scenes', 'resembled', 'Hulk', 'did', ""n't"", 'check', 'studio', 'created', 'effects', 'am', 'guessing', 'are', 'same', 'one.The', 'humans', 'were', 'not', 'stereotypical', 'comic', 'bad', 'guys', 'had', 'different', 'motives', 'even', 'amounted', 'same', 'mistreatment', 'intelligent', 'animals', 'Even', 'Cesar', '34', 'adopted', 'father', '34', 'treated', 'pet.Look', 'hints', 'links', 'original', 'movie', 'such', 'famous', 'lines', 'familiar', 'names', 'Just', 'showing', 'how', 'history', 'turn', 'about', 'fair', 'play.I', 'rooted', 'apes']",Rise of the Planet of the Apes
