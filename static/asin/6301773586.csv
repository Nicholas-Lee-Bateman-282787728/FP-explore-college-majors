265433,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6301773586,Bobby Underwood,"[126, 129]","Betty Smith's heartfelt and timeless novel of a young girl's passage through her youth in the Brooklyn slums was transformed by director Elia Kazan into one of the most touching and deeply felt films ever made. It has that rare ability to break your heart one moment and make you smile the next. There is a tenderness here that has rarely been captured on film. Many point to Elia Kazan's flashier films, but it was this sentimental film that was his crowning achievement. There are moments in this film when even those who never cry at the movies will be moved to tears.Peggy Ann Garner was so wonderful as the young and sensitive Francie, the Academy gave her an Oscar for Most Promising Juvenile Performer. James Dunn garnered an Oscar also as Francie's loving father, Johnny Nolan, a singing waiter with a gift for dreaming he passes on to Francie, who wants to be a writer. Francie's papa makes their hard life worth living and she worships him. He understands and adores her.But when he isn't working, Johnny is usually drunk. Everyone in their poor neighborhood knows Johnny is a good man, however, and loves and respects him. He is the one who will find a way for Francie to attend the school she dreams of, even though it is far from their home. Francie's mother is the only one who doesn't seem to see how special Johnny is.Dorothy McGuire gives another terrific performance as Francie's hard working mother, Katie, who tries desparately not to love her boy Neely more than Francie, and fails; tries desparately not to become bitter with the charming lad she married in her youth, but can't; and tries desparately not to let her heart grow cold and hard, and fails once more.Francie and her family may live in poverty, but Kazan takes the time to show the joy that can be found in the small things in life. For Francie, her father represents happiness and living. Joan Blondell, as Katie's sister and Francie's aunt Sissy, with her free spirit and big heart, adds to Francie's joy in life. It is one of Blondell's finest roles.It is Peggy Ann Garner's emotional performance, however, you will always remember. She brings a sweetness and sincerity to Francie that makes her unforgettable. Purchasing this film is an opportunity to own one of the true masterpieces in American cinema. It will touch your heart and remind you what Hollywood was once capable of, and make you wonder where it all went wrong.",5,Tender Passage of Youth,1112054400,"03 29, 2005",2005,2413,"['Betty', 'Smith', 'heartfelt', 'timeless', 'novel', 'young', 'girl', 'passage', 'youth', 'Brooklyn', 'slums', 'was', 'transformed', 'director', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'one', 'most', 'touching', 'deeply', 'felt', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'rare', 'ability', 'break', 'heart', 'one', 'moment', 'make', 'smile', 'next', 'tenderness', 'here', 'rarely', 'been', 'captured', 'film', 'Many', 'point', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'flashier', 'films', 'was', 'sentimental', 'film', 'was', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'are', 'moments', 'film', 'when', 'even', 'who', 'never', 'cry', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'moved', 'tears.Peggy', 'Ann', 'Garner', 'was', 'so', 'wonderful', 'young', 'sensitive', 'Francie', 'Academy', 'gave', 'Oscar', 'Most', 'Promising', 'Juvenile', 'Performer', 'James', 'Dunn', 'garnered', 'Oscar', 'also', 'Francie', 'loving', 'father', 'Johnny', 'Nolan', 'singing', 'waiter', 'gift', 'dreaming', 'Francie', 'who', 'be', 'writer', 'Francie', 'papa', 'hard', 'life', 'living', 'worships', 'adores', 'her.But', 'when', ""n't"", 'working', 'Johnny', 'usually', 'drunk', 'Everyone', 'poor', 'neighborhood', 'knows', 'Johnny', 'good', 'man', 'however', 'loves', 'one', 'who', 'will', 'find', 'way', 'Francie', 'attend', 'school', 'even', 'far', 'home', 'Francie', 'mother', 'only', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'see', 'how', 'special', 'Johnny', 'is.Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Francie', 'hard', 'working', 'mother', 'Katie', 'who', 'desparately', 'not', 'love', 'boy', 'Neely', 'more', 'Francie', 'tries', 'desparately', 'not', 'become', 'bitter', 'charming', 'lad', 'married', 'youth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tries', 'desparately', 'not', 'let', 'heart', 'grow', 'cold', 'hard', 'once', 'more.Francie', 'family', 'may', 'live', 'poverty', 'Kazan', 'time', 'show', 'joy', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'small', 'things', 'life', 'Francie', 'father', 'happiness', 'living', 'Joan', 'Blondell', 'Katie', 'sister', 'Francie', 'aunt', 'Sissy', 'free', 'spirit', 'big', 'heart', 'Francie', 'joy', 'life', 'one', 'Blondell', 'finest', 'roles.It', 'Peggy', 'Ann', 'Garner', 'emotional', 'performance', 'however', 'will', 'always', 'remember', 'sweetness', 'sincerity', 'Francie', 'unforgettable', 'Purchasing', 'film', 'opportunity', 'own', 'one', 'true', 'masterpieces', 'American', 'cinema', 'will', 'touch', 'heart', 'remind', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'once', 'capable', 'make', 'wonder', 'where', 'went', 'wrong']",A Tree Grows in Brooklyn VHS

James Dunn is excellent as the good-hearted father who just can't seem to make a go of it; Dorothy McGuire is his cold, practical wife, the rock of the family; and Peggy Ann Garner is the daughter Francie who loves her father dearly. The relationship between Francie and her father is beautifully depicted and is one of the best things about the movie.The movie is ripe for sentimentality, but it's a credit to director Elia Kazan (his first movie) that it never stoops to that level. In fact, the movie is filled with very realistic scenes, filmed with both eyes wide open: a woman (and her baby) is stoned for being an unwed mother, and after Francie is molested Katie shoots her attacker. The last 20 minutes are a bit of a letdown, but the acting and script (by Tess Slesinger and Frank Davis) are first-rate and engrossing.

Peggy Ann Garner, as ""Francie,"" was incredible. The adults may get top billing but Garner is the show here, start to finish. She is a real pro, not just with her lines but with her facial expressions. If this young girl doesn't bring a tear or two to your eyes, then get some counseling!! She was so impressive that she was given a special Academy Award for her performance: 2 - It''s a powerful story which is a big reason the book, by Betty Smith, has been a best-seller for almost 60 years. 3 - One of Hollywood's more likable guys, James Dunn, is perfect as Francie's father and who could criticize anything Dorothy McGuire did in this film? 4 - Joan Blondell also was a great choice to play the sassy Aunt Sissy. 5 - Ted Nolan is very funny as Francie's younger brother. Notice the kid is eating in almost every scene. He adds needed humor to the movie. He hardly gets a notice when people discuss this film, and that's unfortunate.BAD NEWS: 1 - Hollywood ignored Garner's acting talent shortly after this film and ruined what could have been a tremendous acting career. 2 - Fox Studio Classics announced that this was finally going to be out on DVD on Feb. 22, 2005, and then yanked the disc at the last minute with no explanation.

Fox had scheduled it for release in 2004 and then pulled it. Why? I believe the reason is that they sub-leased this title for release in Europe and thus can not release it until the lease runs out. They are not interested in putting it out in just a Region 1 version, so will hold off until all rights revert back to them. Too bad as this is one that I would dearly like not only to have, but to share with others. Update: It has now been released on DVD as part of a set of Elia Kazan films that includes many titles that have already been released on DVD along with a few Kazan directed titles that are new. The great news is that this film is now available on BLU-RAY exclusively from Fox Connect. It is found in a collection titled KAZAN AT FOX, Vol. 2 and includes in addition to TREE three other excellent films: Viva Zapata!; Man On A Tightrope and Wild River.

Melillo ""gloriana""","[5, 14]","Perhaps A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, a novel where characterisation and the inward thoughts of characters is so powerful, would be difficult to adapt to film in any case. Yet this version (while not as distorted as the 1980s one) is hugely disappointing.Francie Nolan is a complex character - one of a family of survivors in circumstances which range from sordid to deeply moving. The film version borrows some of a character's traits, yet leaves out those which are most telling. For example, for all of Katie's toughness and bitterness, the book shows us that she is a &quot;vivid conversationalist,&quot; and one who can laugh at a matinee or enjoy a picnic excursion. Here, Katie seems to border on a shrew. Nor is it Katie alone who suffers this treatment: Sissy, also complex and beautifully drawn in the original, is largely &quot;re-worked,&quot; and, while the book does not gloss over Johnny's alcoholism, he is handsome, charming, and lovable, where the film leaves one wondering how Katie found him attractive.If the characters are diminished, much to the film's detriment, some of the setting seems a bit too charming. Hungry, shivering Francie, who has suffered much from the sordid side of life, seems a bit prissy, and far more fortunate, in this depiction. It is as if the rags she and Neeley dragged to the seller each Saturday have been starched and ironed.The book is especially powerful because it shows the reader the intricacy, and both the beauty and pain, of all sorts of loving relationships. Shying away from the inherent complexity, this just seems a rather dull group in a poor neighbourhood. The film, by contrast, is far too &quot;pat,&quot; and no stimulation to mind or heart.

On one hand he &quot;named names&quot; during the McCarthy era, on the other hand his body of work is so distinguished that even his detractors must give the devil his due.How to make a story about a little girl growing up poor in Brooklyn with her little brother, lovable, feckless, alcoholic daddy and her desperately conscientious but humorless mother, without resorting to bathos?  It's a tightrope I don't think Capra could manage.  Imagining Margaret O'Brien as the little girl makes me cringe. Instead, Kazan chose Peggy Ann Garner, who doesn't hit a false note. Same with James Dunn, who won an Oscar for his &quot;daddy.&quot; And Dorothy McGuire, as the mother, succeeds in the difficult job of gaining sympathy for an unsympathetic character.The ending is bitter-sweet and without melodrama, so that what hits you at the end is not the climax but the totality of the story.

Sweet,"[3, 3]","Though a bit fast-paced and somewhat similar in style to a stage play, this movie very much brings Betty Smith's characters and their plights to life and does not leave us wishing they had treated the written work with more care.  My mother was born and raised as a city girl, and her descriptions of growing up in Philadelphia remind me of this portrayal of life in Brooklyn.  I very much envision a reflection of many things my mother described about her childhood in this movie.  For example, that some children she grew up with had never seen a cow.  A parallel of this exists in the film when Francie writes about going to see cotton fields.  The longing behind this is very similar to the stories my mother related to me.The opposites attract theory is wonderfully done in this story, and I ache for Dorothy McGuire's character, and her struggles, especially her iron will to do what is right for her family's survival.  The conflict of Pipedreamer versus Realist is well balanced, so that we are not judgmental of either's actions.  The interplay between the characters leads nicely to the heart wrenching loss of one and the anguish of the other over what could have been done differently.  The devastating effects of alcoholism are featured in this film, but in contrast with a strong element of hope.  Additionally, the reality of the numbers of children born at home and the infant mortality rate of the time period are also presented, but not stressed so overwhelmingly as to take away from the happiness of the new additions to the family and the positive direction of their future.Joan Blondell's portrayal of Aunt Sissy is my favorite part of this movie.  She is charming, funny, steadfast, quirky, and absolutely perfect.What is interesting about this film in comparison to the book is that only about two-thirds of the family's story is told.  I would definitely recommend reading the novel if you want to know about Francie and Neeley as far as their careers after graduation, and what happens to the rest of the family.  The book also goes into much greater detail as far as the extent of the struggle with poverty and the multitudes of families who experience similar situations.

As Francie Nolan in Elia Kazan's first film A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN, she comes close to tearing up the screen as a young girl trapped in class anxiety with foolish hopes and dreams that get shattered on a regular basis.  If you think Margaret O'Brien shows childhood neurosis in the Halloween scene of MEET ME IN ST LOUIS, she's a cold fish compared to the tears shed by Garner in nearly every act of A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN.  The wrenching performances Kazan later eked out of Brando, Dean, Clift are here foreshadowed by a child's desperate search for a better way of life.After the film was released, Peggy Ann was briefly famous and valued, but her grip on reality was never very strong, and she was deeply hurt when prettier, less talented girls were picked for the parts she really wanted, and her life became a vale of tears.

265469,A29OFQ7ZDJLCI2,6301773586,Laura,"[8, 14]","After I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, one of my favorite books, about ten times, I finally found out that it had been made into a movie. I went out to rent it from the movie store with great enthusiasm, and I popped it into the VCR as soon as I got home. To my intense disappointment, the movie wasn't even half as good as the book.For one, because the movie was edited from a PG-13 book to G movie, a lot of the more poignant, moving, and disturbing parts of the book were taken out. Unfortunately for the movie, many of the scenes that were taken out made the book all the better.Also, the movie toned down the terrible atmosphere in which Francie lived. There was no mention of the beatings and other cruelty of the teachers, no mention of violence that existed in the neighborhood, and downplayed Francie's (the main character's) struggle to overcome adversity and get an education.Lastly, the thing that cheapened the movie the most for me, was the &quot;inclusion&quot; of the tree. In the book, the tree had subtle symbolic overtones and could be interpreted to represent Francie's life. The tree became a moving part of the story. Betty Smith, the author, gracefully included it. However, in the movie, the tree was shoddily dealt with. I vividly remember Francie's father telling her to &quot;look at that tree, struggling to grow out of concrete. Be like that tree. Never give up.&quot; I groaned audibly at that contrived line.Although the movie is okay, it was a big disappoinment for me after reading the book.

This sensitive portrayal boasts superlative acting and great sets; the plots moves along at a good pace to keep your interest, too.The action unfolds as the Nolans continue their struggle against the odds to keep things afloat financially. Katie Nolan (Dorothy McGuire) is the tough as nails mother who must work like a slave because her pipe dreaming alcoholic husband Johnny (James Dunn) can't find steady work to support the family. Of course this puts a strain on their marriage and sometimes the children Francie (Peggy Ann Garner) and Neeley (Ted Donaldson) have to go without much nurturing from their busy and preoccupied parents. When Johnny does arrange for Francie to go to a better school, however, we see his true desire to provide for his children despite his personal shortcomings. At times Katie Nolan seems so hard as nails you would wonder who would have ever wanted to stay married to her! Katie appears all the rougher as contrasted with her relatively carefree and independent thinker sister Sissy, played to perfection by Joan Blondell.Family life in the tenement doesn't offer much hope although this family, stronger than they would initially appear to be, fight to keep a halfway decent standard of living. The cutting down of the only tree they can see from the rear windows of their tenement apartment symbolizes the incredible uphill battle they face to stay afloat.Many questions arise: Will Katie and Sissy, the two sisters, be able to get along any better than Katie and her husband Johnny do? What about Francie--will she be required to grow up prematurely because of the events that happen to her family in this movie? Will Neeley be able to rise to the occasion to help his family despite his tender age? No spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to get the movie and watch to find out!Peggy Ann Garner gives a stunning performance as Francie Nolan; there were times near the end of the film when I had to wipe tears from my eyes--and I never cry! It's a shame she didn't become more of a movie star; her portrayal of Francie leaves nothing to be desired--she deserved the Oscar she won for this role.The cinematography is great in scenes including the one early on when the only tree they have is cut down; and the choreography shines in scenes like the Christmas tree ""giveaway"" on Christmas Eve when it becomes too late to sell the trees and Francie and Neeley try to win a tree.Overall, A Tree Grows In Brooklyn is a masterpiece directed by Elia Kazan.

265474,A1TT5T47AVDDBM,6301773586,Mcgivern Owen L,"[8, 8]","""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" is about a struggling Irish family in turn of the (20th) Century Brooklyn. The key figure is the hard working mother (Dorothy McGuire), holding her brood together in the face her shiftless, alcoholic husband (James Dunn).  This reviewer remembers the movie being considerably softer on the old man than the earthier novel by Betty Smith.  In fact, this observer thought the movie to be quite optimistic in comparison. There are solid performances throughout TGB: The strongest are on the distaff side. McGuire is first rate as the often stern mom, old before her time, keeping things in hand. Peggy Ann Garner is wonderful, as Francie, a dreamer of a child and a practical young woman all at once. Joan Blondell provides spunk as Aunt Sissy, McGuire's sister. She steals most of her scenes.  Among the males Lloyd Nolan is perfect as the neighborhood Irish cop and James Gleason briefly shines as a gruff but sturdy bar owner.  TGB did well at Oscar time; James Dunn won a statue for his role as the Father, and Garner won a special award. TGB also took an Oscar for best adapted screenplay.  This reviewer would have nominated Blondell for playing the sassy Sissy. The bottom line is that TGB is a winning film about an ordinary family surviving in a difficult, if not tragic, situation. It is very pleasant viewing. Other reviewers have carped about comparisons to the more serious book. Viewers are urged to take both on their own terms; each can stand alone.  A final observation:  TGB is yet another in a lengthy set of examples of why old black and white releases should not be colorized.

265481,A2EWN4ANV3CPG6,6301773586,Paul Sayles,"[59, 61]","A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a movie that will hit a lot of people in many ways.  For me, it is a reminder of my strong willed mother, alcoholic father and free-spirited brother.  I think, like Francie, I was my father's friend more than I was his son.  I would listen to his stories, wait up for my parents when they had gone to a party to make sure they got home ok, listen to my mother raking my father for his drinking and cringing as dad just sat there.The casting is outstanding and makes the movie work.  Not just the major roles, but the smaller ones too are exceptionally casted.  Put someone else in as the junkman and it might not work as well.  Another person in the role of the doctor signing the death certificate may leave a different and lesser impression.  Lloyn Nolan, Dorothy McGuire and James Dunn were all inspiried choices.  Joan Blondell was a brilliant choice as Aunt Sissy, her of many husbands but still with a element of humanity that has stuck with her.There are many memorable scenes but some have a deeper and lasting meaning.  A young girl named Flossie is showing off her new dress to all passers by.  After a few moments it is apparent that Flossie is not well.  Later when we learn she has died, McGuire tells Dunn that she'll have to buried in potter's field. Dunn hits the right tone, as in a resolute voice he reminds his wife that her parents did the right thing while she was alive by getting her new dresses.  Good for dad!The other scene that hits me every time I see it, is the scene when after dad has died, Francie goes around and collects his shaving mug from the barber and puts it is a box under her bed.  She still has a part of him!Dad's posthumous graduation gift to Francie is one of the most moving scenes I've ever witnessed.  Blondell outdoes herself as the supporting and careing adult sharing a little girls bottled up grief.Where I live in Japan now, Annie Laurie is used as a song for an advertisement.  When I hear the music and words, I don't think of the product but of the scene in the movie when Dunn learns they have inherited a piano from the previous room tenent and is playing and singing Annie Laurie.  Pieces such as this stick in my mind.Some will say that the movie doesn't include everything from the book and that is lacks the gritty poverty, that it is a rather stilted happy ending.  They have a point but folks, get into the characters, feel what they are trying to project and you'll come away from the movie a better person for having seen it.

Christenson / Lunamation ""SpaceComics.com""","[0, 0]","I've seen well over 4,000 movies (3,245 since I started keeping a list, and at least 100 a year before that), and of them all, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn stands out in my memory as the single most effective in terms of the performances of the actors affecting the viewer.It's a simple story about a poor family, a timeless story that will ring true to millions of families around the world, similar in type to movies like I Remember Mama, The Human Comedy, and Our Vines Have Tender Grapes, but more serious, and in my opinion even more insightful than those fine films.  And it's certainly one of the top five tear-jerkers of all time, up there with films like All Mine to Give, On Borrowed Time, Old Yeller, and My Girl.  But it's pleasant to watch, even joyful at times, even if you anticipate the sad part.Every actor in the film rose to the occasion, bringing the character's of Betty Smith's novel to life with fidelity and veracity, depth and breadth, in several cases giving the best performance of a lifetime.  That's certainly the truth in the cases of Peggy Ann Garner as young Francie and James Dunn as her lovable, lovable, and lovable - and alcoholic - lovable father Johnny Nolan, both recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences with Oscars for their roles in this movie, for best juvenile performer, and best supporting actor, respectively.  But also I think Dorothy McGuire as Francie's mother Katie, Joan Blondell as Aunt Sissy, and Lloyd Nolan as Officer McShane each gave their finest performances ever here.  (Funny little coincidence of names:  Nolan played Mike Shane in several movies, here he plays McShane in a movie full of Nolans.)There's not much point in detailing the plot here; you should certainly see it for yourself, and it's a shame it's not on DVD yet, as of this writing.  Suffice it to say one parent is an irresponsible dreamer, the other a hard provider, both giving love in different ways, and young Francie must learn to retain the best from each.If you've read the book by Betty Smith, this film is very faithful except they left out one incident that would have been considered inappropriate in a film in the 1940s, when young Francie was approached by a molester. The film works perfectly without that.Another favorite character actor has a small role:  James Gleason (Here Comes Mr. Jordan, The Bishop's Wife, Suddenly), as one of Johnny's friends.",5,How a family grows.,1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,2412,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'well', '4,000', 'movies', '3,245', 'started', 'keeping', 'list', 'least', '100', 'year', 'A', 'Tree', 'Grows', 'Brooklyn', 'out', 'memory', 'single', 'most', 'effective', 'terms', 'performances', 'actors', 'affecting', 'viewer.It', 'simple', 'story', 'poor', 'family', 'timeless', 'story', 'will', 'ring', 'true', 'millions', 'families', 'world', 'similar', 'type', 'movies', 'Remember', 'Mama', 'Human', 'Comedy', 'Vines', 'Have', 'Tender', 'Grapes', 'more', 'serious', 'opinion', 'even', 'more', 'insightful', 'fine', 'films', 'certainly', 'one', 'top', 'five', 'tear-jerkers', 'time', 'up', 'there', 'films', 'Mine', 'Give', 'Borrowed', 'Time', 'Old', 'Yeller', 'My', 'Girl', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'even', 'joyful', 'times', 'even', 'anticipate', 'sad', 'part.Every', 'actor', 'film', 'rose', 'occasion', 'bringing', 'character', 'Betty', 'Smith', 'novel', 'life', 'fidelity', 'veracity', 'depth', 'breadth', 'several', 'cases', 'giving', 'best', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'certainly', 'truth', 'cases', 'Peggy', 'Ann', 'Garner', 'young', 'Francie', 'James', 'Dunn', 'lovable', 'lovable', 'lovable', 'alcoholic', 'lovable', 'father', 'Johnny', 'Nolan', 'recognized', 'Academy', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Arts', 'Sciences', 'Oscars', 'roles', 'movie', 'best', 'juvenile', 'performer', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'respectively', 'also', 'think', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'Francie', 'mother', 'Katie', 'Joan', 'Blondell', 'Aunt', 'Sissy', 'Lloyd', 'Nolan', 'Officer', 'McShane', 'gave', 'finest', 'performances', 'ever', 'here', 'Funny', 'little', 'coincidence', 'names', 'Nolan', 'played', 'Mike', 'Shane', 'several', 'movies', 'here', 'McShane', 'movie', 'full', 'Nolans', 'not', 'much', 'point', 'detailing', 'plot', 'here', 'should', 'certainly', 'see', 'shame', 'not', 'DVD', 'yet', 'writing', 'Suffice', 'say', 'one', 'parent', 'irresponsible', 'dreamer', 'other', 'hard', 'provider', 'giving', 'love', 'different', 'ways', 'young', 'Francie', 'must', 'learn', 'retain', 'best', 'each.If', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'Betty', 'Smith', 'film', 'very', 'faithful', 'left', 'out', 'one', 'incident', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'inappropriate', 'film', '1940s', 'when', 'young', 'Francie', 'was', 'approached', 'molester', 'film', 'perfectly', 'that.Another', 'favorite', 'character', 'actor', 'small', 'role', 'James', 'Gleason', 'Here', 'Mr.', 'Jordan', 'Bishop', 'Wife', 'Suddenly', 'one', 'Johnny', 'friends']",A Tree Grows in Brooklyn VHS

Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2""","[1, 2]","The Betty Smith novel from which this movie is adapted, was one of my mother's favorite books; and since it was in her collection and readily available, it's one of the first books I read as a youngster. Mom loved movies too and I'm sure she went to see this when it first came out in 1945...but amazingly, today was the first time I've seen this exceptional film. The novel is divided into five books and this film roughly covers the events in Books 1, 3 and 4. It is a slice-of-life story of a second generation Irish-American family living in turn-of-the century (1912) Brooklyn. Katie and Johnny Nolan have two children; 13 year old Francie and 12 year old Neeley. Katie is the primary breadwinner, washing floors in the tenement where they live and collecting rags for sale. Johnny is an alcoholic singing waiter, who has trouble holding down a job. Francie is a sensitive and intelligent teen, a good student with a talent for writing. James Dunn, who plays Johnny was a leading man in his early career, but hit a rough patch, so this role which earned him an Oscar, was a huge comeback for him. Dorothy McGuire, who plays Katie, also delivers an inspired performance. But the best performance - arguably - is by child actor, Peggy Ann Garner, as Francie and she won a Juvenile Academy Award for her performance; but as with many gifted child actors, she never caught on as an adult. Also look for Joan Blondell as Aunt Sissie (Katie's sister); and Lloyd Nolan as Officer McShane, who befriends the family.

As Francine, Peggy Ann Garner plays her role with an amazing display of natural unaffected intelligence uncommon in child actors of her era; hers is a wonderfully tear-jerking performance.  Dorothy McGuire is fine as Francine's long-suffering mother Katie (something about her seemed a bit too classy for her character at times, but nothing to wreck another excellent portrayal).  As the illiterate, rather loose-loving - and intensely likeable - Aunt Cissy, Joan Blondell does justice to her role.  Blondell later wrote that there was originally a scene where children were playing outside on the street and find a tin full of condoms; curious, they went to Cissy for explainations. Blondell claimed the scene in which she lovingly explained about life and love to the children was the best she ever did - naturally, it was deemed too distasteful for release!

Also one of Katie's sisters is eliminated and her qualities and quotes from the book are giving to Sissy, somewhat toning down her character. Other characters, like Francie's school teacher, are changed to protagonists to ease the transition to film.However, Elia Kazan's masterpiece with Dorothy McGuire as Katie Nolan, the hard as nails mamma, Joan Blondell as the effervescent, fun loving aunt Sissy, Oscar award winning James Dunn as Johnny Nolan, the drunkard pipe-dreaming father and little Peggy Ann Garner was so wonderful as the young, sweet and sensitive Francie. Thankfully,  the Academy gave her an Oscar for Most Promising Juvenile Performer in the year of our Lord 1945.I am no wimp by any stretch of the imagination but EVERY SINGLE time I view my ""homemade/bootleg"" DVD copy I bawl like a little baby...This film is LOOONG overdue for a U.S DVD Release.

265495,ACM90BRKX73OG,6301773586,Tom,"[4, 5]","A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (20th Century Fox, 1945) was director Elia Kazan's debut film.Thirteen-year-old Francie Nolan (Peggy Ann Garner) and her younger brother, Neeley (Ted Donaldson), live in a Brooklyn tenement in 1900. Their mother, Katie (Dorothy McGuire), struggles to keep the family afloat as their father, Johnny (James Dunn), an alcoholic, squanders his paychecks at the corner saloon. Johnny still dreams of being a famous singer but only finds irregular employment as a singing waiter. But he and Francie have a loving bond. Katie tries to shield her children from her free-spirited sister, Sissy (Joan Blondell), with mixed results. Officer McShane (Lloyd Nolan), the neighborhood flatfoot, assists the Nolans on a several occasions and takes a private shine to Katie.Katie loves Johnny but has become hardened and embittered by his failures. She finally confronts him and brings his pipe dreams crashing to the ground.  When Francie, a bright girl, desires to attend a better public school in a nicer neighborhood, Johnny makes the arrangements by telling school officials she has moved in with relatives. It is the one thing Johnny can do for his daughter even if it is dishonest.When Katie becomes pregnant, she moves the family upstairs to a cheaper apartment to save money. Johnny is so distraught he sits down at a piano left behind by the previous tenant and sings a tearful rendition of ""Annie Laurie,"" acknowledging the broken promise of his marriage.The Nolans enjoy a few festive moments on Christmas Eve before Katie informs Johnny the children must drop out of school and go to work to help support the family. Crushed by the thought of Francie having to give up her dreams, Johnny walks out into the frigid winter night in search of steadier work.After Johnny goes missing for a week, the family discovers he died of pneumonia after working on a tunnel digging crew. Although he was a drunk and a failure, the neighborhood deeply misses the affable Johnny, much to Katie's amazement. The saloon keeper offers the Nolan children part-time jobs so they are able to stay in school. While in labor, Katie reaches out to Francie and makes amends for her past coldness. Francie graduates from grammar school and Officer McShane proposes to Katie, offering the security Johnny was never able to provide.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a thoroughly enjoyable film and a remarkable debut for Kazan. The cast is magical. Peggy Ann Garner is a complete delight in her Oscar-winning portrayal. Jimmy Dunn was also awarded a well-deserved Oscar. Dunn was a washed up alcoholic and was basically playing himself in the role. His ""Annie Laurie"" scene is extraordinary. Beautiful Dorothy McGuire gives a fine performance as practical, puritanical Katie although Kazan later complained she was too refined for the part. McGuire's natural beauty takes your breath away but the soft-spoken actress could surprisingly be a bit difficult on the set. As Peggy Ann Garner reflected much later, ""Kazan had a marvelous quality. He even knew how to handle Dorothy McGuire, and there was a certain way you had to handle that lady."" Joan Blondell is an audience pleaser as the coquettish Sissy, who is constantly after her sister to cut Johnny some slack. Even young Ted Donaldson is enjoyable as the grumpy Neeley. The settings and the performances are thoroughly realistic and evoke the rough and tumble environment of 1900 Brooklyn. Although Kazan dismissed A Tree Grows in Brooklyn as sentimental corn pone, the young director did a wonderful job telling a sweet story.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, a family film classic, amazingly is not available in the USA as an individual DVD but it is included as one of the fifteen films in the Elia Kazan Collection box set. A decent commentary is provided with analysis from Richard Schickel, Kazan, Ted Donaldson, and Norman Lloyd. Special features also include ""The Making of A Tree Grows In Brooklyn"" documentary along with a look at one of Hollywood's loveliest actresses, ""An Appreciation of Dorothy McGuire.""Kazan would go on to direct a total of nineteen movies. He is noted for introducing Stanislavski/Method acting into films and bringing a level of realism to the screen which was unknown up until that time. Kazan is remembered as the most important American director of his day, both on Broadway and in Hollywood. Two of his films, Streetcar Named Desire and On The Waterfront are included in the American Film Institute's 1998 and 2007 lists of the Top 100 American Films. Kazan had raised the bar on filmmaking and strongly influenced the next generation of young directors. Several influential actors made their debuts in Kazan films including Marlon Brando, James Dean, and Warren Beatty. Kazan's testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1952 in which he named names of former members of the American Communist Party drew the undying ire of liberals and haunted the remainder of his career. Kazan was presented with an honorary Oscar in 1999 for his lifetime achievements in film despite protests from the Left.

265498,A2E330I8TKW4C1,6301773586,WSH,"[6, 6]","Betty Smith's acclaimed 1940s novel is given a memorable and enduring treatment by director Elia Kazan, on his debut. The film works so well for an audience today, despite being rooted in a very specific time and place -- pre-war Brooklyn -- because its real concerns are universal. The contest or contrast between a dreamy, charming, alcoholic husband, who makes others feel good about life, and a practical mother, who runs the family and makes herself less attractive to others in her relentless pursuit of a decent living, could be transposed to any culture, any time. The cast are faultless. The mother, Dorothy McGuire (who Kazan apparently thought might be too refined for the part) is excellent as Mrs Catherine Nolan. She understands the role intimately and gets the acquired 'hardness' of the woman, determined to lift up her family's fortunes, just right. James Dunn picked up an Oscar for his performance as her husband. Who could deny him? He is totally believable in the part. Both children are excellent: in a sense they are at the core of the story (almost all the outdoor action concentrates on them) and the actors carry the story with charm and humour. There are a handful of films about family life lived at the fringes of poverty which, by striking a balance between joy and pain, have retained lasting value. This is one of them.The Korean-made DVD provides a good image and sound from an unrestored but clean copy of the film.

It is a true classic, marking Elia Kazan's directing debut. Based on Betty Smith'sA Tree Grows in Brooklyn (P.S.), this 1945 movie narrates the bittersweet coming-of-age tale of young Francie Nolan who together with her parents and younger brother Neely, lead a hardscrabble existence in Brooklyn at the turn of the 20th century.Peggy Ann Garner turns in an award-winning performance (winning the Academy Juvenile Award)as the determined young Francie who craves learning and is portrayed as an ardent reader, working her way alphabetically through the library catalogue. Francie loves her family, but especially adores her father, the happy-go-lucky alcoholic, Johnny Nolan (James Dunn) who is beloved by many but earns the displeasure of his weary wife, Katie (Dorothy McGuire) because of his inability to provide for his family. Katie takes on odd jobs, scrubbing floors in their tenement building, and collecting scraps of rags. Thanks to Katie's frugal and thrifty ways, the family makes do, but just barely.The story follows the Nolan family through their hard times and makes for a compelling and heartbreaking watch as viewers witness the trials of a family making their way in the world. Francie is my favorite character in the movie - her steely determination, great love for her father, and her never ending quest to better herself and get a good education just resonated with me, and Peggy Ann Garner delivers a thoroughly convincing performance. Dorothy McGuire tears at one's heart through her credible portrayal of a long-suffering wife whose initial passion for her husband turns dour with the passage of time and whose outlook on life dims and becomes jaded by the practicalities of everyday living.I have read the source work and though the adaptation takes liberties with the book, I felt it stayed true to the spirit of the novel.
