645331,A3T2V257AME9SP,B00005JP3M,A.B.,"[6, 8]","WARNER BROS - Thank goodness It's Mama's Family and not yours! Mama's Family of dinalings, wannabes and can't-get-alongs sure knows how to put the fun in dysfunctional. Season 1 of this uproarious working class comedy series - spun off the popular skits originated on The Carol Burnett Show stars Burnett Show alumna Vicki Lawerence as cantankerous Mama, Ken Berry (F-Troop) as her dim-bulb son and Rue McClanahan (The Golden Girls) as her flighty sister. Add guest appearances by Carol Burnett as tightly wound daughter Eunice, Burnett Show veteran Harvey Korman as Eunice's hapless hubby and Betty White (The Golden Girls) as Mama's highfalutin daughter Ellen, and you have 13 hilarious episodes in a 2-disc set that prove Father knows best... but Mama knows funny!It's the First Season on DVD. The packaging says The Complete First Season but these are rather the syndicated cuts. The original NBC openings, and Alistar Quince sequences have not been included in this release. There are no special features and the DVD runs approximately at 278 minutes. With 13 episodes in all!!!!! Even though they are the syndicated cuts I still recommend you to buy this set, Warner does not own the original cuts.With being over 20 years old, this show is still as funny if not FUNNIER than the shows that are on today. Jokes are still laughable and not out of date, as is with many sitcoms of the past (Leave it to Beaver). Please note the episodes appear out of order on this set.Disc One1. Vint and the Kids Move InAs soon as Vin'ts chinchillas start breeding, he'll move up in the world. In the mean time, he'll move in... with Mama.2. For Better or for WorseGasp! Wheeze! Mama hyperventilates when she discovers that Vint and Naomi spent the night together3. The Wedding P-1Too much booze and way too much Eunice threaten to ruin Vint and Naomi's nuptials.4. The Wedding P-2It's that special day - and possibly dooms day unless Eunice gets to sing O Promise Me at the cerimony.5. Family FeudIs Mama's mind as sharp as her tongue? The Harpers appear on Family Feud against a clan of know it alls.6. CellmatesNow that's a surprise. Mama throws a surprise party for Eunice, and they both end up in the slammer.7. Mama Gets a JobThe American economy has withstood depressions and wars. Now its days may be numbered: Mama gets a job.DISC TWO8. Double StandardIt's a guy thing. For Homecoming, Vint give Sonja a midnight curfew, but Buzz gets to stay out until 1 am.9. Mama's BoyfriendRed-hot Mama. The family is in a dither when Mama goes out to dinner... with a man!10. Fran's DressFran has the dress for an awards banquet: pink, beaded, slinky....and scorched after Mama gives it a quick pressing.11. Alien MarriageHow do you say ""dumb idea"" in Portuguese? Vint agrees to wed an immigrant who wants a fast track to a green card.12. Positive ThinkingThe power of positive Eunice. Will movtivational tapes make her a new and better woman?13. Mama's SilverStick a silver fork in this mother-son relationship - it's done! Vint pawns Mama's cherished sterling.",4,GOOD LORD!

Vint later hooks up with Thelma's floozy neighbour Naomi (Dorothy Lyman).  Also living in the house is Thelma's spinster sister Fran (Rue McClanahan); frequent visitors include Thelma's squabbling daughters Ellen (Betty White) and Eunice (Carol Burnett).MAMA'S FAMILY originally debuted on NBC in early 1983.  It was cancelled in 1985 but brought back in first-run syndication the following year; finally wrapping in 1990.  ""Golden Girls"" fans will get a kick out of seeing Betty and Rue together here; Carol Burnett's guest appearances in several of the better episodes (including the two-part ""Wedding"" and ""Cellmates"", arguably the best episode in the first year) are to be savoured.At this stage it would be safe to assume that Warners won't be issuing any further season sets.  Let's hope that Shout! Factory (or similar) will come to the party.  We need Thelma Harper now more than ever!Episodes:""Vint and the Kids Move In"" - Vint's chinchilla business has gone belly up, leaving him and the kids homeless...but Thelma promised the spare room for Fran to use as a writing studio...""For Better or For Worse"" - Thelma's nightmare has come true.  After an evening of poring through Vint's collection of TV Guides, Vint and Naomi announce their engagement.""The Wedding"" (Parts 1 & 2) - The day has arrived.  Vint and Buzz head off for the buck's party, leaving the girls at home to amuse themselves.  Cheap wine soon livens up the proceedings but Ellen still has a secret involving her husband's secretary.  Eunice wants to sing ""Oh Promise Me"" at the ceremony, but not even a tray of chilli dogs will sway Thelma.""Family Feud"" - Vint arranges for the Harper clan to appear on ""Family Feud""...will it all end in tears?""Cellmates"" - Ed (Harvey Korman) and Thelma surprise Eunice with a birthday celebration at the Bigger Jigger...which soon dissolves into a fiasco when Eunice uncovers the reason why a childhood boyfriend left and never called on her again.""Mama Gets a Job"" - It's a GREAT day at the Raytown Travel Agency...or is it?  Unappreciated Thelma gets a job but the opportunity soon turns sour, as Vint and the others can't seem to operate without constantly phoning her.""Double Standard"" - Sonja is woman...hear her roar!  When she discovers the differences in how Vint treats Buzz, Sonja (with the support of Thelma and Naomi) decides to take a stand.""Mama's Boyfriend"" - Thelma has a date...with a MAN?  The Harper clan don't know what to make of this unusual occurrance.""Fran's Dress"" - Disaster for Fran when a distracted Thelma ruins her beautiful new dress hours before she's due at an awards banquet.""Alien Marriage"" - Vint decides to marry a Portugese woman in order to get some money.  *This story does not follow the continuity of the earlier episodes (ie: Naomi and Vint are not yet married).""Positive Thinking"" - A new Eunice?  That seems to be the case when she starts a regime of positive thinking cassettes, and lands a small role at the Pepper Pot Playhouse.  Guest stars Gloria DeHaven.""Mama's Silver"" - The gloves are off when Thelma discovers that Vint pawned her silver service in order to bail a deadbeat friend (Geoffrey Lewis) out of jail.",4,Thelma Harper and her wacky brood come home on DVD!,1282003200,"08 17, 2010",2010,3681,"['unexpected', 'spin-off', ""'Family"", 'skits', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'Show', 'MAMA', 'FAMILY', 'reunited', 'audiences', 'Vicki', 'Lawrence', 'sharp-tongued', 'Thelma', 'Harper', 'introduced', 'extended', 'brood', 'wacky', 'family', 'members', 'show', 'Mama', ""n't"", 'too', 'pleased', 'arrival', 'son', 'Vint', 'Ken', 'Berry', 'two', 'teenaged', 'kids', 'Buzz', 'Sonja', 'Eric', 'Brown', 'Karin', 'Argoud', 'who', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'stay', 'indefinitely', 'following', 'Vint', 'wife', 'departure', 'become', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'showgirl', 'er', 'cocktail', 'waitress', 'Vint', 'later', 'up', 'Thelma', 'floozy', 'neighbour', 'Naomi', 'Dorothy', 'Lyman', 'Also', 'living', 'house', 'Thelma', 'spinster', 'sister', 'Fran', 'Rue', 'McClanahan', 'frequent', 'visitors', 'include', 'Thelma', 'squabbling', 'daughters', 'Ellen', 'Betty', 'White', 'Eunice', 'Carol', 'Burnett', '.MAMA', 'FAMILY', 'originally', 'debuted', 'NBC', 'early', '1983', 'was', 'cancelled', '1985', 'brought', 'back', 'first-run', 'syndication', 'following', 'year', 'finally', 'wrapping', '1990', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'fans', 'will', 'get', 'kick', 'seeing', 'Betty', 'Rue', 'together', 'here', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'guest', 'appearances', 'several', 'better', 'episodes', 'including', 'two-part', 'Wedding', 'Cellmates', 'arguably', 'best', 'episode', 'first', 'year', 'are', 'be', 'savoured.At', 'stage', 'would', 'be', 'safe', 'assume', 'Warners', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'issuing', 'further', 'season', 'sets', 'Let', 'hope', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'similar', 'will', 'come', 'party', 'need', 'Thelma', 'Harper', 'now', 'more', 'ever', 'Episodes', 'Vint', 'Kids', 'Move', 'Vint', 'chinchilla', 'business', 'gone', 'belly', 'up', 'leaving', 'kids', 'homeless', 'Thelma', 'promised', 'spare', 'room', 'Fran', 'use', 'writing', 'studio', 'Better', 'Worse', 'Thelma', 'nightmare', 'come', 'true', 'evening', 'poring', 'Vint', 'collection', 'TV', 'Guides', 'Vint', 'Naomi', 'announce', 'engagement', 'Wedding', 'Parts', '1', '2', 'day', 'arrived', 'Vint', 'Buzz', 'head', 'buck', 'party', 'leaving', 'girls', 'home', 'amuse', 'Cheap', 'wine', 'soon', 'up', 'proceedings', 'Ellen', 'still', 'secret', 'involving', 'husband', 'secretary', 'Eunice', 'sing', 'Oh', 'Promise', 'Me', 'ceremony', 'not', 'even', 'tray', 'chilli', 'dogs', 'will', 'sway', 'Thelma', 'Family', 'Feud', 'Vint', 'arranges', 'Harper', 'clan', 'appear', 'Family', 'Feud', 'will', 'end', 'tears', 'Cellmates', 'Ed', 'Harvey', 'Korman', 'Thelma', 'surprise', 'Eunice', 'birthday', 'celebration', 'Bigger', 'Jigger', 'soon', 'fiasco', 'when', 'Eunice', 'reason', 'why', 'childhood', 'boyfriend', 'left', 'never', 'called', 'again', 'Mama', 'Job', 'GREAT', 'day', 'Raytown', 'Travel', 'Agency', 'Unappreciated', 'Thelma', 'job', 'opportunity', 'soon', 'sour', 'Vint', 'others', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'operate', 'constantly', 'phoning', 'Double', 'Standard', 'Sonja', 'woman', 'hear', 'roar', 'When', 'differences', 'how', 'Vint', 'treats', 'Buzz', 'Sonja', 'support', 'Thelma', 'Naomi', 'take', 'stand', 'Mama', 'Boyfriend', 'Thelma', 'date', 'MAN', 'Harper', 'clan', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'make', 'unusual', 'occurrance', 'Fran', 'Dress', 'Disaster', 'Fran', 'when', 'distracted', 'Thelma', 'beautiful', 'new', 'dress', 'hours', 'due', 'awards', 'banquet', 'Alien', 'Marriage', 'Vint', 'marry', 'Portugese', 'woman', 'order', 'get', 'money', '*This', 'story', 'not', 'follow', 'continuity', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'ie', 'Naomi', 'Vint', 'are', 'not', 'yet', 'married', 'Positive', 'Thinking', 'new', 'Eunice', 'be', 'case', 'when', 'regime', 'positive', 'thinking', 'cassettes', 'small', 'role', 'Pepper', 'Pot', 'Playhouse', 'Guest', 'Gloria', 'DeHaven', 'Mama', 'Silver', 'gloves', 'are', 'when', 'Thelma', 'Vint', 'pawned', 'silver', 'service', 'order', 'bail', 'deadbeat', 'friend', 'Geoffrey', 'Lewis', 'jail']",Mama's Family:  Season 1

We get to see some special gust stars by Carol Burnett the legendary herself Betty White who are just as wacky as ever. Specially Carol. Mama is my favorite character which is played by Vickie Laurence along with Eunice who is played by Carol who is one of mama's three children. The chemistry between Mama and Eunice is priceless. You get all the laughs and more out of ""Mama's Family"". I already told you about the all the fun you could have by watching this great show. Now hear comes the sad part about this ""DVD release. Like so many other ""good"" TV shows it is sadly standing alone with no word of it's follower....season 2. The fact is that this season was released back in 2006. I thought to myself ""Well that's typical. Looks like another case of bad sales."" I'm noticing a lot of these ""good"" TV shows are suffering because of bad sales. What people needs to realize is just because a show is old doesn't mean it's worthless. I really don't see a reason why today's generation just can't sit down and appreciate comedy of this show's quality. I'm young myself so I can speak for myself when I say I ""actually"" like comedy like this. Oh, sure I am also in to a little bit of today's TV shows but I seem to manage to fit an oldie in every once in a while. I bought this for $24.99 and I know for a fact that that was extremely close to Warner Brother's asking price. Now everywhere I look copy's for this is on sell for $9.99. Warner is ""in fact"" losing money now. So if by any chance that price for this show goes back up to the full asking price and you have not got it yet, tell your friends and family and whoever likes this show to order there copy's ASAP. I get the fact that some people can't afford it and that is perfectly understandable. We do live in a low down economy. But take this as good advise, if you are a fan of this show and you are saving for something newer(perhaps a newer TV show) and you want to wait on this one pick this one up first because you know the newer items will last longer on shelves plus most likely there will be more seasons seeing's how it's a new show anyway. The popularity is very high for newer shows. Show's like this however needs the most attention. Believe me. You don't have to take my advise but it's the only way I can think of that ""could"" work on saving the future for this show and other cancelled TV show's for DVD release.

Some have indicated that Mama's Family was a low point in American popular culture.  On some levels, I heartily agree.  But when I look back at the sitcoms we were watching in the Eighties--The Facts of Life, Gimme a Break, Different Strokes, Family Ties and, Lord, help us, The Golden Girls--I remember Mama's Family as being hysterically funny.  It's a shame that these episodes are the edited ones that aired in syndication, and the cuts are in fact noticeable, as a previous reviewer indicates.  Nevertheless, there are some very good episodes here, and to call this show only a comedy would be to mis-label it; I remember in the Eighties, TV Guide referred to this show as a comedy/drama.  There are dramatic moments between the laughs, and what one sees here, which we did not see in the sketches that originally aired on The Carol Burnett Show, is that Thelma Harper is a full person, a complex character who speaks from sorrow, heartache, fear, jealousy.  She is not just a loud-mouth old lady (who reminds me of my Italian grandmother of the same generation), but a character to whom we can relate, and when we learn of her past, her fears, her disappointments, we understand why she is as she is and perhaps behaves as she does, and therein lies the shows value: its revelations into the conflicted human soul, punctuated by laughs.  I don't want to over-dramatize that here, but the relationships between the characters are at times very realistic and based in things any of us can relate to:  hating your new ""floozie-in-law,"" enduring disappointment from your kids, living with relatives, realizing how much you loved your spouse once he or she is gone, realizing, maybe too late, that the life you are living is not the life you thought you'd be living.  These revelatory moments come between the laughs of episodes like The Wedding and Fran's Dress and The Double Standard.

The two DVD set includes all 13 episodes from the shows first season. Please don't write me about syndicated episodes, not all fans are as feverish as others.  I barely remember the show and am pleased with the syndicated cuts.Character actress Vickie Lawrence starred as ""Mama,"" a grey haired house dress wearing woman. Of course in real life Vickie Lawrence wasn't quite as old as Mama, in all reality she was younger than Betty White and Carol Burnett who played her daughters Eunice and Ellen. Rue McClanahan starred on the series as Mama's sister.Eunice and Ellen didn't appear on the show as often as Mama's son Vinton (Ken Berry). Vinton was a tad bit clueless and as the series began he and his teenage children moved in with Mama. It wouldn't take long before Vinton fell in love with former high school cheerleader Naomi (Dorthy Lymon). Mama couldn't stand Naomi. As the season started, Vinton and Naomi would be planning a wedding.The first season of Mama's Family was funny and it's easy to watch all thirteen episodes in a single sitting. There were a lot of cool episodes during the shows first season. Mama and The Harpers appear on the television show Family Fued. The family is in a tizzy when they think Ellen's husband is having an affair. Mama is less than successful in entering the work force in the episode ""Mama Get's A Job,"" and Mama even takes a stab at dating in the episode ""Mama's Boyfriend.""Mama's Family was a popular funny show during the 1980s. The teenage kids didn't have huge storylines during the shows first season and after the first two seasons they would be written out completely.

Eunice was always my favorite character in those days.  I was very glad to see her appear during the tv debut of the sitcom.  But as time went on they made Mama out to be the lead star and it really worked.  After nearly being cancelled after two seasons another network came to the rescue of Mama.  Aunt Fran and Ellen Harper Jackson left the show to be on the Golden Girls.  I don't know where Buzz and Sonia went.  Maybe to live with their mother Mitzi in Las Vegas.  Enter Iola Lucille Boylen (The Harper's Neighbor) and Bubba Higgins (Ed and Eunice's wayward son).  The two characters added some much needed change to the series.  Iola as mama's sidekick was such a great idea becuase the chemistry between the two was remarkable.Some of my favorite episodes from the entire series of Mama's Family:Vint and Naomi's WeddingEunice and Mama spend the night in the Jug.Mama's Class Reunion.Madame Rita meets Ezmarelda The Queen of The Gypsies.Naomi's troubles at Food Circus with the new boss.April Fools.Mama Clause.Some of my favorite lines:1.(MAMA) I'M MOVING AS FAST AS I CAN CHUBS!!!2.(NAOMI) I'M NOT PLAYING WITH A BIG LOSER.

645381,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B00005JP3M,JGC,"[5, 7]","Contrary to popular belief, ""Mama's Family"" is technically not a spin-off ofThe Carol Burnett Show. It is actually an aftereffect of the (much) lesser-known 1982 movie, aptly titled ""Eunice."" However, there were many eps of ""The Family"" (as it was known on Ms. Burnett's show) that are very much-loved. As you know, the sitcom premiered as a mid-season replacement in Jan. 1983 on NBC and was canceled the following season. Like many other family-friendly shows of the 80's ""Mama's Family"" found another life. This time the show was re-invited for first-run syndication. And, throughout the rest of the run of ""Mama's Family"" it remained the number one syndicated show in the country!""Mama's Family"" is as 80's as the New Coke, Apple Computers and the Material Girl's conical braziers. You can't get more 80's than ""Mama's Family,"" nor can you find a funnier or more clever sitcom with such a stellar cast. From Vicki Lawrence (Mama, of couse) all the way down to prudish Aunt Franny (Rue McClanahan ofMaudeandThe Golden Girls) the entire Harper Family and extended family was blended together so well.Of course my favorite member of Mama's family is her troubled and perpetually unhappy (and equally insecure, not to mention kooky) daughter, Eunice Higgins. Eunice was played by none other than the legend, Ms. Carol Burnett. There was something about Eunice that just made everyone love her. She was always able to draw people to her with one hand while simultaneously pushing them away with the other. The best way to describe Eunice would be as the lovable-loser. She just had such a quality to her that was inexplicably unique because this same quality also managed to cause as much trouble as possible. Eunice was the black sheep of the family that everyone wanted to kick out the door; but never could. I always loved it when Ed (Harvey Korman) called her ""Eunie""Like a really tasty pot of Hungarian Goulash, ""Mama's Family"" is just as diverse. Because like this pot of stew, the family runs the gamut  of having all types of personalities thrown in; including the kitchen sink! One scene could have a warm and fuzzy moment and another could involve a nasty cat-fight between Eunice and Naomi Harper (Dorothy Lyman.) Never one to play second fiddle, Ellen (Betty White, of course best known forThe Golden GirlsandThe Mary Tyler Moore Show) always managed to wiggle her snobbish upturned nose into everyone's affairs. I loved it how someone (usually Eunice) could make such a hateful comment and by the end of the show all would be forgiven. It really was so entertaining watching some of these ""barroom brawls"" take their course on ""Mama's Family."" And, isn't that just like family? The ones that love you the most always hurt the most, right?These are the Season One usual suspects:Vicki Lawrence (Mama Harper)Carol Burnett (Eunice Higgins)Ken Berry (Vinton Harper)Dorothy Lyman (Naomi Oats Harper)Betty White (Ellen Jackson)Rue McClanahan (Fran Crowley)Harvey Korman (Ed Higgins)Eric Brown (Buzz Harper)Karin Argoud (Sonja Harper)There's a total of 13 eps from Season One. Yes, and these aren't the full network versions; instead these are the syndicated versions. I say: so what! These are still great shows. I'm sure some crybaby/hater will leave me a nasty comment but I don't care. (My response to him or her is get a life, don't you have more important things to scream about?!!) If Warner Home Video chooses to do this I am none the sadder. The only other option is to try to catch ""Mama's Family"" on the ION Network. Now those people are the real crooks. Because they license as many shows as they can from Warner Bros. and then they splice and dice and cut to a commercial right in the middle of a pivotal scene. So I don't mind these DVDs at all. As a matter of fact, I just purchased this set as a stocking stuffer for my dad. Like my entire family, he loves this show!Here are the Season One show titles with the original air dates:Vint and the Kids Move In 1/22/1983As the title states, Vint moves in with Mama and Aunt Franny after his first-wife, Mitzy takes off.For Better or For Worse 1/29/1983Vinton is reunited with Naomi Oats, to Mama's horror.The Wedding (1) 2/5/1983The 2 wedding eps are my very favorites from the NBC version. The girls get ready the big day, while the boys go out and celebrate. Ellen makes some comment about it being one of the best evenings of her life; of course this is all prior to Eunice showing up and telling her that her hubby is having an affair with his secretary!The Wedding (2) 2/12/1983Eunice causes temper-tantrum after temper-tantrum during Vint and Naomi's wedding ceromony.Family Feud 2/19/1983The gang all go on ""The Family Feud."" Richard Dawson plays himself in this memorable show.Cellmates 2/26/1983This is another favorite of mine. Eunice really does have a barroom brawl when she finds out that Ed didn't plan any splashy party for her birthday. I love it when Ed says to her, ""what friends Eunie"" when she asks if her friends are going to suddenly pop out to surprise her. In the jail cell, Mama (who's also locked up) befriends Scarlet; a tough-talking hooker who managed to put everything into perspective for Eunice and Mama. I think in this show Mama and Eunice really managed to bond.Mama Gets a Job 3/5/1983Mama gets a job as a receptionist at a travel agency. After she insults an elderly couple one too many times she gets the boot.Double Standard 3/12/1983Mama's grandchildren go to a school dance.Mama's Boyfriend 3/19/1983Mama goes out with an old flame.Fran's Dress 3/26/1983Aunt Fran threatens to move out after Mama scorches her dress.Alien Marriage 4/2/1983Claude, a friend of Vint's tries to get him to marry an illegal immigrant. Note: this ep aired out of order as Vint was already married to Naomi by now.Positive Thinking 4/30/1983Eunice is the star of this show! She takes up a new positive attitude and things really start to turn out great! She even gets a part in a play that the coveted Pepper-Pot Playhouse is putting on. When Mama comes to the rehearsal and sticks her nose into Eunice's affairs things really start to cook! It's so funny when Eunice manages to pull the toupee off the director's head. And I love it when Eunice refers to the star of the play as ""Miss Piggy."" So funny! Then she come's back to Mama's (seething) and gets into another viscous fight with Naomi, barking, ""I just decked the entire crew at the Pepper-Pot Playhouse, don't think I'm afraid of a freak from the Food Circus.""Mama's Silver 5/7/1983Vint hocks Mama's silver to bail Claude out of jail.Keep in mind, in Season One there isn't any Iola Lucille Boyland (Beverly Archer) or Bubba Higgins (Allan Kayser.) These two (incredibly comical) characters were only relegated to the syndicated version of the show. As Vicki wrote inVicki!: The True-Life Adventures of Miss Fireball, she chose to fire those two that played Vint's kids. She said something like, ""those kids had to go.."" They were somewhat annoying, but the rest of the family was always so first-rate!!",5,"I just decked the entire crew at the Pepper-Pot Playhouse, don't think I'm afraid of a freak from the Food

645382,A19XE6G6NDZFPS,B00005JP3M,Joanna Mechlinski,"[0, 0]","Being 33, I was too young to watch this show when it originally aired, nor the Carol Burnett Show from which the premise originated. So my recent viewing of this DVD set was my first introduction to Mama's Family, as well as actresses Vicki Lawrence and Carol Burnett.In the pilot, Thelma Harper (Lawrence), who already has her sister Fran (Rue McClanaghan) living in her home, finds she will be making room for three more, as her divorced son Vint (Ken Berry) admits to having been evicted and now being homeless with his two teenage children, Sonja and Buzz. Of course, Thelma can't refuse them, although she makes sure to let Vint know precisely how she feels about his life, his choices and his personality flaws at every moment she gets.The family also includes Thelma's daughters Ellen (Betty White) and Eunice (Carol Burnett), as well as Naomi (Dorothy Lyman), Thelma's neighbor who reconnects a high school friendship with Vint and soon after marries him.Particularly noteworthy Season 1 episodes include the two-part wedding of Vint and Naomi, which spawns all sorts of family fights and hijinks; &#34;Family Feud,&#34; where the family travels to California to appear on the show (with a guest appearance by the real host, Richard Dawson); and &#34;Mama Gets a Job,&#34; where the long-time homemaker takes a position at a local travel agency, with disastrous (and hilarious) results.Although this show aired three decades ago, the storylines and humor are still just as funny and relevant today!

I taped several episodes when they initially aired as I am a huge Carol Burnett fan.  Some of the best episodes featured Carol as Eunice interacting with Vicki as Mama.  However, one standout episode I recall was a flash-back to Mama's 30th birthday.  We saw Vint, Ellen and Eunice as children.  The child actress chosen to play Eunice was outstanding.  Same dress as Carol's, same hairstyle, it was Carol's ""Mini-me.""There was another episode in syndication which featured another flashback and Eunice was around 17.  Again, the actress chosen to play Eunice was great.  Again, same dress, same hair.I'm looking forward to seeing these shows again.  Perhaps the producers will release the TV movie ""Eunice"" on day too.",4,Mama's Family - loved this show,1155168000,"08 10, 2006",2006,820,"['Carol', 'Burnett', 'went', 'air', 'TV', 'movie', 'called', 'Eunice', 'aired', 'NBC', 'had', 'Mam', 'Family', 'taped', 'several', 'episodes', 'when', 'initially', 'aired', 'am', 'huge', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'fan', 'best', 'episodes', 'featured', 'Carol', 'Eunice', 'interacting', 'Vicki', 'Mama', 'However', 'one', 'standout', 'episode', 'recall', 'was', 'flash-back', 'Mama', '30th', 'birthday', 'saw', 'Vint', 'Ellen', 'Eunice', 'children', 'child', 'actress', 'chosen', 'play', 'Eunice', 'was', 'outstanding', 'Same', 'dress', 'Carol', 'same', 'hairstyle', 'was', 'Carol', 'Mini-me', 'was', 'episode', 'syndication', 'featured', 'flashback', 'Eunice', 'was', 'around', '17', 'Again', 'actress', 'chosen', 'play', 'Eunice', 'was', 'great', 'Again', 'same', 'dress', 'same', 'hair.I', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'shows', 'again', 'Perhaps', 'producers', 'will', 'release', 'TV', 'movie', 'Eunice', 'day', 'too']",Mama's Family:  Season 1
645385,A2MZ1VBYTQ7MO5,B00005JP3M,Joseph Haggard Jr.,"[9, 11]","""Mama's Family"" is an occasionally very funny sitcom that debuted on NBC in January 1983 as a mid-season replacement during the 1982-83 TV season. Here's a show that began as a series of sketches on the classic ""Carol Burnett Show"". These uproarious skits revolved around an abrasive southern woman named Eunice (played by Burnett) who along with husband Ed (played by Harvey Korman) was constantly at odds with her cantankerous mother (played by Vicki Lawrence). This comedy sketch (which became known as ""Ed & Eunice"") ran occasionally for years on ""The Carol Burnett Show"" (which in reruns is now known as ""Carol Burnett and Friends""), and turned out to be one of the most popular sketches of the long-running comedy/variety show.""Mama's Family"" debuted five years after ""The Carol Burnett Show"" went off the air. Vicki Lawrence reprised her role as Mama (aka Thelma Harper), with Burnett and Korman reprising their Eunice and Ed roles but only in a couple of guest appearances. This show was going to be a little different from the sketches that appeared on Burnett's variety series, because it was going to revolve less around Eunice and Ed, and more around the other members of Mama's family. In the first  episode of ""Mama's Family"" were introduced to Mama's sister Fran (Rue McClanahan), her son Vint (Ken Berry), her teenage grandchildren Buzz and Sonja (Eric Brown and Karin Argoud), and her next-door neighbor Naomi (Dorothy Lyman). Also turning up in episode one is Mama's other daughter Ellen (Betty White), who was a recurring character in the ""Ed & Eunice"" sketches on ""The Carol Burnett Show"" and would show up here several times on ""Mama's Family"".As the series starts, Mama lives in a house with Fran in the city of Raytown. Then Vint and his kids Buzz and Sonja move in with Mama and Fran after his wife runs off to Las Vegas to become a showgirl. Then Vint falls in love with neighbor Naomi, marries her, and in the process she moves into the house too (this after their plan to move to Arizona backfires through a crooked scheme). Through all of this the cranky Mama practically has verbal battles with just about everyone, including Eunice, Ed, and Ellen whenever they stop by for a visit. That's what ""Mama's Family"" is all about: this noisy clan with a matriarch constantly arguing with her family members about all the shenanigans that go on in and out of the household.This leads to some very funny episodes. The two part episode titled The Wedding (episodes 3 & 4) is uproarious. It's the one where Vint and Naomi get married, and everyone is there for the event (including Eunice, who as usual gets angry with her family members who end up ticking her off over certain things). The best and funniest episode of season one is episode 5: Family Feud. This is the one where Mama, Vint, Naomi, Ellen, and Buzz fly out to California to appear on the classic game show, and end up making fools of themselves (especially Mama, who doesn't know how to play the game right). Richard Dawson, the original host of Family Feud, guest stars as himself and is hilarious. Another funny episode is episode 7: Mama Gets a Job. In this one, Mama gets a job at the Raytown Travel Agency and all hell breaks loose. Episode 11: Alien Marriage, is another explosively funny episode. Here, Vint agrees to marry a Portuguese woman so she can obtain a green card and live in the United States, and when Mama finds out what's going on the fur starts to fly big time as Mama proceeds to yell at just about everyone, especially Vint.All 13 episodes of ""Mama's Family"": Season One is for the most part very funny and are worth seeing again. But one thing disappointed me about the episodes that appear in this DVD set: they're the edited episodes that have appeared in rerun syndication, not the original uncut episodes that aired on NBC. I was really hoping to see these episodes of ""Mama's Family"" uncut again, but that's not the case with this DVD. I remembered watching episodes of ""Mama's Family"" when they first aired on NBC when I was a kid, and one of the things that appeared at the beginning of some episodes were special appearances by Harvey Korman who turned up not as Ed but in another role as Alistair Quince, who introduced episodes as if they were a part of a Masterpiece Theatre-type presentation. These quirky introductions were never seen in reruns, and they're not seen here on DVD either. But that's not all. Other scenes have been cut. Take for example my favorite episode Family Feud. After Richard Dawson finishes introducing the opposing family (whose first names all end alike) that's taking on the Harpers, you can hear Mama saying that the whole family is named after puppets while Mr. Dawson continues to talk to the patriarch of that family just before going over to introduce the Harper clan. Another scene that's cut in this episode is the moment where it's Vint's turn to go up to the buzzer to play the next round and hesitates because he's too nervous, and Mama angrily forces him up to go up there because it was his idea to get on the show. In the DVD version of this episode, you can tell there's an edit because when he goes up there, you hear Mr. Dawson tell him ""you're fine."" Also when the question that Vint is asked (""name something that comes in flakes""), Vint responds by saying: ""Cereal. That's what I had for breakfast. Cereal."" One of the lines that's edited in that scene where Vint doesn't want to go up there, he mentions that his mind is so blank to the point where he can't even remember what he had for breakfast that morning. So the edits are quite obvious.Still, there are a lot of laughs on ""Mama's Family"". Vicki Lawrence is a hoot in the lead as Mama, and has a great supporting cast behind her. It's great to watch Betty White and Rue McClanahan working together here just before they both went on to ""The Golden Girls"". Dorothy Lyman is hilarious as the flirtatious Naomi. At the time Lyman was doing ""Mama's Family"", she was also starring on the popular ABC soap opera ""All My Children"", and the role she played on that show (the argumentative Opal) was kind of similar to her Naomi role (she won a daytime Emmy for ""All My Children"" in 1983). Lyman doesn't appear in all 13 episodes of season one, probably because she was working on ""All My Children"" and ""Mama's Family"" at the same time. Nevertheless, whenever Lyman does appear, she's very funny. Eric Brown and Karin Argoud are fun as the teenagers of the household. And Carol Burnett and Harvey Korman are always a welcome presence whenever they turn up (Korman also does double duty as co-director of 11 episodes). The only weak link in the cast is Ken Berry, who's only adequately funny as the lazy, dim-witted Vint. He's O.K. in the role. It's just that the other characters that surround him are more funnier.""Mama's Family"": Season One delivers plenty of laughs for fans of the series. And I'm eagerly anticipating season two, which will have more episodes.",4,Mama's Family - Season One,1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,6981,"['Mama', 'Family', 'occasionally', 'very', 'funny', 'sitcom',

645388,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00005JP3M,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[9, 9]","Beginning in 1983, NBC brought the popular ""The Family"" sketches from The Carol Burnett Show to life with this raucous sitcom based on those unforgettable characters.  In most cases, the sketch format never quite succeeds when extended beyond a few minutes (witness the slate of failed SNL movies), but there was something inherently relatable about the tacky and confrontational Harper clan that struck a chord with America.  We could laugh at the over-the-top spectacle while still seeing the heart and truth underneath their wild shenanigans.  The show lasted an impressive six seasons, and has lived on in perpetuity in syndication.  Earlier efforts to bring Mama to the DVD market were met with enormous hostility by stalwart fans.  The shows were in tatters thanks to the endless cycle of syndication which chopped both the witty introductions and major portions of the program from existence.  Star Vista (in conjunction with Time Life) has sought to remedy this injustice with a recent Complete Series release reconfigured from the original Broadcast masters.  And while the results may not be perfect (some musical numbers are still notably absent), this is probably as good as it's going to get.  If you aren't able to pick up the financial burden of the Complete Series (current suggested price 199.95), Seasons One and Two have been dropped individually.The Season One release has all thirteen episodes spread over 3 discs with a couple of worthwhile Bonus Features:Bonus Content:1) Mama's Family Tree: The Branches Featurette: All About Eunice and Ellen2) Sketch (featuring Betty White) with the Family from a 1976 Carol Burnett ShowEpisode List:1) Vint and the Kids Move In2) For Better Or Worse3) The Wedding, Part One4) The Wedding, Part Two5) Family Feud6) Cellmates7) Mama Gets A Job8) Double Standard9) Mama's Boyfriend10) Fran's Dress11) Alien Marriage12) Positive Thinking13) Mama's SilverThe success of ""Mama's Family,"" and its enduring popularity, rests with a great cast (many held over from Carol Burnett days).  This was, perhaps, the role that defined Vicki Lawrence's career and will forever be associated with her.  As the stubborn matriarch Thelma Mae Crowley Harper, it's hard to imagine anyone else donning that awful wig, strand of pearls, and housecoat (and I find it hilarious that the show actually won a Costuming EMMY).  Of course, the majority of early storylines had Thelma contending with Vint (Ken Berry) and his new bride (Dorothy Lyman).  Lyman became a terrific foil for Lawrence, their antagonism could be legendary.  But the show also benefited from an extended cast that featured Rue McClanahan (Fran), Imogene Coca (Gert), Carol Burnett (who made her last appearance as Eunice in Season Two), and Harvey Korman (who made his last appearance as Ed in Season One).  As a side note, it's great to see Korman's spiffy introductions as Alistair Quint returned to the DVD!In the end, ""Mama's Family"" is a nostalgic treat for those who loved it the first time around.  It's silly, loud, and extremely tacky but also surprisingly lovable.  I'm not sure new viewers will embrace it quite as much as those with a personal connection, but the truth behind the family conflict still has resonance.  As I mentioned, this may not be the perfect release but it's markedly better than prior DVD iterations.

645401,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B00005JP3M,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[111, 118]","Mama's Family definitely gets five stars.  One of my favorite shows of all-time, especially during its first two seasons with the occasional appearances of Eunice.  What a stellar cast: Vicki Lawrence, Betty White, Rue McClanahan, Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman, Dorothy Lyman, Ken Berry (How was it ever canceled in the first place?) I really liked the kids Buzz and Sonja, too.The reason I am knocking a star off the score is that these episodes are edited.  They are like the syndication edits that are still aired all the time. What's up with that??!!  I've been waiting to see these episodes uncut for years.  I know how much they've cut because I have an audio recording of ""The Wedding Part 1"" from when it aired back around 1985 (a rerun even, not the first airing which was 2/5/83):1. They cut out the part about the hoochie coochie dancer in the kitchen scene with Mama, Buzz, and Vint.2. When Sonja asked if she was a slave, Fran's comeback line ""If you were, you would've been sold years ago"" is gone.3. Mama explaining to Sonja that ""strong drink can make even the daintiest of ladies seem unattractive and crude"" (and then hic-ups from the beer) got the ax.4. The scene with Mama and Fran in the kitchen is shortened.5. They cut out Mama talking about seeing her husband Carl naked out of the shower. She shoved him in the linen closet and never looked again.6. A lot of dialogue about the controversy over Eunice's ""O Promise Me"" solo is missing.7.  And the worst omission of all:  Eunice screaming ""Well All Right!!!"" after Mama exclaimed, ""This is my house and I say there ain't gonna be no da*n singing!"" isn't there!  I've been looking forward to seeing that scene again which always seems to be cut in syndication.These are just what is cut out of one episode! And the tags during the closing credits are missing, too. I definitely would have paid more money to get these episodes uncut, wouldn't you?  Anyway, here are the episodes from Season 1:""Vint and the Kids Move In"": Vint and the kids are kicked out of their house and they have to move in with Mama.""For Better or For Worse"": ""Her! Him! Here!"" Mama hyperventilates when she finds out Naomi and Vint spent the night together down in the basement.  Vint and Naomi then decide to get married and run a trailer park in Arizona.""The Wedding Part 1"":  While getting ready for the wedding to be held a Mama's showplace, Eunice takes delight in telling sister Ellen the truth about her husband and his secretary.""The Wedding Part 2"": Eunice slightly changes her rendition of ""O Promise Me"" after she finds out Mama gave Vint her father's sapphire ring.  Later, Vint and Naomi discover there trailer park plans were a rip-off and they have to move in with Mama again.""Family Feud"": The Harpers ""wind up"" on Family Feud.  Richard Dawson is a guest.""Cellmates"":  Eunice and Mama find themselves in jail with a prostitute who gets them to consider their mother/daughter relationship.  This is the episode where Eunice finds out Mama sent her dream man Duke Reeves away when she was in high school.""Mama Gets A Job"": Mama gets a job at a travel agency and her family keeps bugging her a work.  I like the part where she's learning how to answer the phones: ""It's a great day here at the Raytown Travel Agency!  May I heeelp you?!""""Double Standard"":  Sonja gets all women's rights when she finds out her younger brother has a longer curfew.""Mama's Boyfriend"": Mama shocks her family when she plans on spending a weekend in a cabin by the lake with an old flame.""Fran's Dress"": Mama accidentally ruins Fran's priced dress she plans on wearing to an awards banquette.""Alien Marriage"":  In another get-rich-quick scheme, Vint plans on marrying a Portuguese woman to get her a green card.  In this episode, Naomi and Vint are not married yet.  Naomi is still Mama's complaining neighbor.  Anyway, Mama really goes off in this one!  Great shouting scene including a nice argument between Mama and her flighty, old maid sister Fran.""Positive Thinking"":  One of the funniest episodes.  Eunice starts listening to positive thinking tapes and gets a role in a play.  Great Eunice line: ""I just decked the entire cast over there at the Pepperpot Playhouse!""""Mama's Silver"": Vint pawns Mama's precious sterling.",4,"""Boy howdy, I bet the neighbors are just loving this!""--Mama",1163203200,"11 11, 2006",2006,4264,"['Mama', 'Family', 'definitely', 'five', 'stars', 'One', 'favorite', 'shows', 'all-time', 'especially', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'occasional', 'appearances', 'Eunice', 'What', 'stellar', 'cast', 'Vicki', 'Lawrence', 'Betty', 'White', 'Rue', 'McClanahan', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'Harvey', 'Korman', 'Dorothy', 'Lyman', 'Ken', 'Berry', 'How', 'was', 'ever', 'canceled', 'first', 'place', 'really', 'liked', 'kids', 'Buzz', 'Sonja', 'reason', 'am', 'knocking', 'star', 'score', 'episodes', 'are', 'edited', 'are', 'syndication', 'are', 'still', 'aired', 'time', 'What', 'up', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'see', 'episodes', 'uncut', 'years', 'know', 'how', 'much', ""'ve"", 'cut', 'have', 'audio', 'recording', 'Wedding', 'Part', '1', 'when', 'aired', 'back', '1985', 'rerun', 'even', 'not', 'first', 'airing', 'was', '2/5/83', ':1', 'cut', 'out', 'part', 'hoochie', 'coochie', 'dancer', 'kitchen', 'scene', 'Mama', 'Buzz', 'Vint.2', 'When', 'Sonja', 'asked', 'was', 'slave', 'Fran', 'comeback', 'line', 'were', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'sold', 'years', 'ago', 'gone.3', 'Mama', 'explaining', 'Sonja', 'strong', 'drink', 'can', 'make', 'even', 'daintiest', 'ladies', 'seem', 'unattractive', 'crude', 'then', 'hic-ups', 'beer', 'got', 'ax.4', 'scene', 'Mama', 'Fran', 'kitchen', 'shortened.5', 'cut', 'out', 'Mama', 'talking', 'seeing', 'husband', 'Carl', 'naked', 'shower', 'shoved', 'linen', 'closet', 'never', 'looked', 'again.6', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'controversy', 'Eunice', 'O', 'Promise', 'Me', 'solo', 'missing.7', 'worst', 'omission', 'Eunice', 'screaming', 'Well', 'Right', 'Mama', 'exclaimed', 'house', 'say', 'there', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'be', 'da*n', 'singing', ""n't"", ""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'scene', 'again', 'always', 'be', 'cut', 'syndication.These', 'are', 'just', 'what', 'cut', 'one', 'episode', 'tags', 'closing', 'credits', 'are', 'missing', 'too', 'definitely', 'would', 'have', 'paid', 'more', 'money', 'get', 'episodes', 'uncut', 'would', ""n't"", 'Anyway', 'here', 'are', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'Vint', 'Kids', 'Move', 'Vint', 'kids', 'are', 'kicked', 'house', 'have', 'move', 'Mama', 'Better', 'Worse', 'Him', 'Here', 'Mama', 'when', 'out', 'Naomi', 'Vint', 'spent', 'night', 'together', 'down', 'basement', 'Vint', 'Naomi', 'then', 'decide', 'get', 'married', 'run', 'trailer', 'park', 'Arizona', 'Wedding', 'Part', '1', 'getting', 'ready', 'wedding', 'be', 'held', 'Mama', 'showplace', 'Eunice', 'delight', 'telling', 'sister', 'Ellen', 'truth', 'husband', 'secretary', 'Wedding', 'Part', '2', 'Eunice', 'slightly', 'rendition', 'O', 'Promise', 'Me', 'out', 'Mama', 'gave', 'Vint', 'father', 'sapphire', 'ring', 'Later', 'Vint', 'Naomi', 'discover', 'there', 'trailer', 'park', 'plans', 'were', 'rip-off', 'have', 'move', 'Mama', 'again', 'Family', 'Feud', 'Harpers', 'wind', 'up', 'Family', 'Feud', 'Richard', 'Dawson', 'guest', 'Cellmates', 'Eunice', 'Mama', 'find', 'jail', 'prostitute', 'who', 'consider', 'mother/daughter', 'relationship', 'episode', 'where', 'Eunice', 'out', 'Mama', 'sent', 'dream', 'man', 'Duke', 'away', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'Mama', 'Job', 'Mama', 'job', 'travel', 'agency', 'family', 'bugging', 'work', 'part', 'where', 'learning', 'how', 'answer', 'phones', 'great', 'day', 'here', 'Raytown', 'Travel', 'Agency', 'May', 'heeelp', 'Double', 'Standard', 'Sonja', 'women', 'rights', 'when', 'out', 'younger', 'brother', 'longer', 'curfew', 'Mama', 'Boyfriend', 'Mama', 'family', 'when', 'spending', 'weekend', 'cabin', 'lake', 'old', 'flame', 'Fran', 'Dress', 'Mama', 'accidentally', 'Fran', 'priced', 'dress', 'wearing', 'awards', 'banquette', 'Alien', 'Marriage', 'get-rich-quick', 'scheme', 'Vint', 'marrying', 'Portuguese', 'woman', 'get', 'green', 'card', 'episode', 'Naomi', 'Vint', 'are', 'not', 'married', 'yet', 'Naomi', 'still', 'Mama', 'complaining', 'neighbor', 'Anyway', 'Mama', 'really', 'off', 'one', 'Great', 'shouting', 'scene', 'including', 'nice', 'argument', 'Mama', 'flighty', 'old', 'maid', 'sister', 'Fran', 'Positive', 'Thinking', 'One', 'funniest', 'episodes', 'Eunice', 'listening', 'positive', 'thinking', 'tapes', 'role', 'play', 'Great', 'Eunice', 'line', 'just', 'decked', 'entire', 'cast', 'there', 'Pepperpot', 'Playhouse', 'Mama', 'Silver', 'Vint', 'Mama', 'precious', 'sterling']",Mama's Family:  Season 1

645404,A3DYIGOLWS5CNS,B00005JP3M,Niel Rishoi,"[17, 19]","Mama's Family was one of the enduring 1980s sitcoms that never received any respect from critics. The ""Hooterville"" aspect and often slight plotlines caused a lot of disdainful scorn. What these critics missed, and what audiences loved, however, were the outstanding characterizations. The first few seasons, some of those characterizations took awhile to evolve (but never less than entertaining); Mama for example was none too bright at first, but luckily, she later became the sassy, bossy voice of reason that held the family together. Vicki Lawrence really had a faultless, masterful command of this character. It is a classic TV personage. Her Mama's perpetual crankiness, all from a skilfully limned comic timing, was flawless. Lawrence had all the classic irascible old-lady mannerisms down pat. Ken Berry's Vint evolved from being slightly tedious to a truly funny, lovable goofball who was always tripping over himself. Dorothy Lyman's endearing sex kitten Naomi got funnier and sexier with each succeeding season; Lyman was an impeccable comedienne. Carol Burnett's Eunice added a shockingly bitter, but funny edge to the first season. Betty White's Ellen was a delightful I-don't-want-to-be-seen-with-my-family upper class, Seville-driving snob. Rue McLanahan didn't quite work as Aunt Fran (the character was too ambiguously drawn): she found a much better role as the nymphomaniac Blanche in The Golden Girls. Vint's kids in the first season did OK, but they never really found their niche in the ensemble. Allan Kayser's Bubba was the perfect replacement as Eunice's juvenile hall son. He added an edgy, youthful countenance that the show needed, and for Mama to play off of. Beverly Archer's hilariously anachronistic Iola was an absolute hoot: she brought the perfect nosy- neighbor, awful-crafts-making characterization to the show. Best of all, this cast played off each other like true pros. There was a true sense of the ensemble spirit that only comes from a mutual self-respect amongst the actors. They made it look so easy and effortless, one might have a tendency to see only the zany, sometimes thin plots to overlook just how indelibly formed all the characters were. Often, nothing major happened in the Harper's lives; they were lower-middle class citizens who had rummage sales, church suppers, etc. But the cast brought a true down-home quality to the show, and most importantly, they made it funny - how?? By playing the comedy absolutely straight. No schticking, no ""Oh look at me I'm funny"" behavior. These are talented, professional farceurs who knew exactly what they were doing. You realize, after all the bad sitcoms that came and sank without a trace, why this one survived. There was a reason this series endured for 8 seasons, and why it continues to win new fans in syndication: it was one of the best, unheralded sitcoms of the 1980s. Great to see it on DVD at last, and hope that WB will follow through quickly with the remaining seasons. No doubt about it: this series will sell.",5,Outstanding characterizations in classic down-rural home show,1157155200,"09 2, 2006",2006,3024,"['Mama', 'Family', 'was', 'one', 'enduring', '1980s', 'sitcoms', 'never', 'received', 'respect', 'critics', 'Hooterville', 'aspect', 'often', 'slight', 'plotlines', 'caused', 'lot', 'disdainful', 'scorn', 'What', 'critics', 'missed', 'what', 'audiences', 'loved', 'however', 'were', 'outstanding', 'characterizations', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'characterizations', 'took', 'awhile', 'evolve', 'never', 'less', 'entertaining', 'Mama', 'example', 'was', 'none', 'too', 'bright', 'first', 'luckily', 'later', 'became', 'sassy', 'bossy', 'voice', 'reason', 'held', 'family', 'together', 'Vicki', 'Lawrence', 'really', 'had', 'faultless', 'masterful', 'command', 'character', 'classic', 'TV', 'personage', 'Mama', 'perpetual', 'crankiness', 'skilfully', 'limned', 'comic', 'timing', 'was', 'flawless', 'Lawrence', 'had', 'classic', 'irascible', 'old-lady', 'mannerisms', 'down', 'pat', 'Ken', 'Berry', 'Vint', 'evolved', 'being', 'slightly', 'tedious', 'truly', 'funny', 'lovable', 'goofball', 'who', 'was', 'always', 'tripping', 'over', 'Dorothy', 'Lyman', 'endearing', 'sex', 'kitten', 'Naomi', 'got', 'funnier', 'sexier', 'succeeding', 'season', 'Lyman', 'was', 'impeccable', 'comedienne', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'Eunice', 'added', 'shockingly', 'bitter', 'funny', 'edge', 'first', 'season', 'Betty', 'White', 'Ellen', 'was', 'delightful', ""I-don't-want-to-be-seen-with-my-family"", 'upper', 'class', 'Seville-driving', 'snob', 'Rue', 'McLanahan', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'Aunt', 'Fran', 'character', 'was', 'too', 'ambiguously', 'drawn', 'found', 'much', 'better', 'role', 'nymphomaniac', 'Blanche', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'Vint', 'kids', 'first', 'season', 'did', 'OK', 'never', 'really', 'found', 'niche', 'ensemble', 'Allan', 'Kayser', 'Bubba', 'was', 'perfect', 'replacement', 'Eunice', 'juvenile', 'hall', 'son', 'added', 'edgy', 'youthful', 'countenance', 'show', 'needed', 'Mama', 'play', 'off', 'Beverly', 'Archer', 'hilariously', 'anachronistic', 'Iola', 'was', 'absolute', 'hoot', 'brought', 'perfect', 'nosy-', 'neighbor', 'awful-crafts-making', 'characterization', 'show', 'Best', 'cast', 'played', 'off', 'other', 'true', 'pros', 'was', 'true', 'sense', 'ensemble', 'spirit', 'only', 'mutual', 'self-respect', 'actors', 'made', 'look', 'so', 'easy', 'effortless', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'tendency', 'see', 'only', 'zany', 'sometimes', 'thin', 'plots', 'overlook', 'just', 'how', 'indelibly', 'formed', 'characters', 'were', 'Often', 'nothing', 'major', 'happened', 'Harper', 'lives', 'were', 'lower-middle', 'class', 'citizens', 'who', 'had', 'rummage', 'sales', 'church', 'suppers', 'etc', 'cast', 'brought', 'true', 'down-home', 'quality', 'show', 'most', 'importantly', 'made', 'funny', 'how', 'playing', 'comedy', 'absolutely', 'straight', 'schticking', 'Oh', 'look', ""'m"", 'funny', 'behavior', 'are', 'talented', 'professional', 'farceurs', 'who', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'realize', 'bad', 'sitcoms', 'came', 'sank', 'trace', 'why', 'one', 'survived', 'was', 'reason', 'series', 'endured', '8', 'seasons', 'why', 'win', 'new', 'fans', 'syndication', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'unheralded', 'sitcoms', '1980s', 'Great', 'see', 'DVD', 'last', 'hope', 'WB', 'will', 'follow', 'quickly', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'doubt', 'series', 'will', 'sell']",Mama's Family:  Season 1

The DVDs are not complete, not by a long shot.The NBC era episodes originally ran about 24 to 25 minutes and featured introductions by Harvey Korman as a character called ""Alastair Quince,"" spoofing Masterpiece Theater's Alastair Cooke. These are gone, along with three minutes of footage from each episode. They now run 21 minutes, as they do in syndication. The later episodes (seasons 3-6, which were first-run syndication) ran at this length originally, but the first 2 seasons did not. Enough footage is gone to equal about one and one half of an episode.After the debacles with ALF, The Cosby Show, and Roseanne on DVD one would think that Warner would have tried to avoid this. Nope. They just slapped on edited episodes and hope fans wouldn't notice. That they didn't include the original 1982 special ""Eunice"" which spawned this show, nor any of the Carol Burnett Show sketches which inspired it, is bad enough.

My response to them was, of course, if you are selling edited releases, the packaging should clearly reflect this.  A series cannot be advertised as Complete if several minutes of footage are missing from each episode.  I realize that some reviewers are satisfied with the edited versions, however, I am not, and will be selling my copy to the local used book store, and hoping that sometime in the future, the original first-run episodes will be made available for release.

645430,A303U1MOXG5R1F,B00005JP3M,Sylviastel,"[22, 28]","I loved Mama's Family when it was on network television and the Harpers when they were just sketch characters. What makes this show great to me was that it was the first time in my life as a television viewer where I saw characters with flaws and all. Nothing was ever really solved by the end of each episode. THe characters were memorable for their clothes or lack of fashion sense and their style. It was nice to see people who weren't rich, educated, or sophisticated like the Harpers. They were like a lot of families then and now in America. Struggling to make ends meet. They didn't look perfect and they weren't smart enough but we loved them anyway. Mama's Family aired on NBC for two seasons. Of course, the network probably didn't like the demographic audience which I truly believe was behind the show's cancellation. Of course behind the scenes, the executive producer Joe Hamilton and his then wife, Carol Burnett, were getting a divorce which I believe is why we never really saw Carol in the second season. I preferred Betty White as snobby Ellen Harper Jackson and Rue McClanahan as old maid Aunt Frances Crowley here then on Golden Girls which really brought them fame and fortune. If you're an actress or an actor, you can watch them on Golden Girls and Mama's Family and you'll know why they won their Emmys. They are great actresses. Betty White did return in syndication for one episode but I'm presuming her schedule conflicted with the syndicated show and I bet NBC wanted Betty to be seen more as Rose than as Ellen. Anyway, the show in syndication was far different from it's network past because like all shows including ""It's A Living,"" ""9 to 5,"" and ""Charles in Charge"" all had cast changes. Going from network to syndication is like going from first class to coach, surprisingly it was there that Mama's Family flourished a year and a half after it's network cancellation. WIthout Rue, Betty, Harvey, Carol, Karin and Eric who played Sonja and Buzz around, they brought in Bubba Higgins and neighbor and spinster Iola Boyland who was also Mama's best friend played by Beverly Archer. Anyway, syndication had it's moments like Brent Spiner who would later play Data on Star Trek: The Next Generation, Dorothy Van who played Aunt Effie should have been a regular player, their trip to Hawaii, Mama on Jeopardy, Anne Haney and Earl Boen who played ALberta and Rev. Lloyd Meecham. Mama moved on with her life. I always wondered what happened to Buzz and Sonja. I think they went to their mother in Las Vegas. I can't wait for it to come on DVD. I'm trying to get Raytown, Missouri to hold a Mama's Family Convention.For the record, season one which included these 13 episodes aired on NBC first season. The second season was also on NBC. NBC cancelled the show in 1984. In January 1986, they returned again without Buzz, Sonja, Ellen or Aunt Fran because the latter two became famous for Golden Girls. Because Carol Burnett's husband Joe Hamilton and her were getting a divorce. Carol and Joe didn't reunite for this series in syndication. Because syndication is like going from first class to coach, the series had to make some adjustments. Bubba played by Allan Kayser and Iola played by Beverly ARcher both joined the show in it's third season in syndication. I now know what the confusion was all about. If you watch these 13 episodes, these were the earliest episodes of the time.",5,First Season on Network and not Syndication!,1153094400,"07 17, 2006",2006,3411,"['loved', 'Mama', 'Family', 'when', 'was', 'network', 'television', 'Harpers', 'when', 'were', 'just', 'sketch', 'characters', 'What', 'show', 'great', 'was', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'television', 'viewer', 'where', 'saw', 'characters', 'flaws', 'Nothing', 'was', 'ever', 'really', 'solved', 'end', 'episode', 'THe', 'characters', 'were', 'memorable', 'clothes', 'lack', 'fashion', 'sense', 'style', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'people', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'rich', 'educated', 'sophisticated', 'Harpers', 'were', 'lot', 'families', 'then', 'now', 'America', 'Struggling', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'perfect', 'were', ""n't"", 'smart', 'enough', 'loved', 'anyway', 'Mama', 'Family', 'aired', 'NBC', 'two', 'seasons', 'course', 'network', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'demographic', 'audience', 'truly', 'believe', 'was', 'show', 'cancellation', 'course', 'scenes', 'executive', 'producer', 'Joe', 'Hamilton', 'then', 'wife', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'were', 'getting', 'divorce', 'believe', 'why', 'never', 'really', 'saw', 'Carol', 'second', 'season', 'preferred', 'Betty', 'White', 'snobby', 'Ellen', 'Harper', 'Jackson', 'Rue', 'McClanahan', 'old', 'maid', 'Aunt', 'Frances', 'Crowley', 'here', 'then', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'really', 'brought', 'fame', 'fortune', ""'re"", 'actress', 'actor', 'can', 'watch', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'Mama', 'Family', ""'ll"", 'know', 'why', 'won', 'Emmys', 'are', 'great', 'actresses', 'Betty', 'White', 'did', 'return', 'syndication', 'one', 'episode', ""'m"", 'presuming', 'schedule', 'conflicted', 'syndicated', 'show', 'bet', 'NBC', 'wanted', 'Betty', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'Rose', 'as', 'Ellen', 'Anyway', 'show', 'syndication', 'was', 'far', 'different', 'network', 'past', 'shows', 'including', 'Living', '9', '5', 'Charles', 'Charge', 'had', 'cast', 'changes', 'Going', 'network', 'syndication', 'going', 'first', 'class', 'coach', 'surprisingly', 'was', 'Mama', 'Family', 'flourished', 'year', 'half', 'network', 'cancellation', 'Rue', 'Betty', 'Harvey', 'Carol', 'Karin', 'Eric', 'who', 'played', 'Sonja', 'Buzz', 'around', 'brought', 'Bubba', 'Higgins', 'neighbor', 'spinster', 'Iola', 'Boyland', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'Mama', 'best', 'friend', 'played', 'Beverly', 'Archer', 'Anyway', 'syndication', 'had', 'moments', 'Brent', 'Spiner', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'play', 'Data', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Dorothy', 'Van', 'who', 'played', 'Aunt', 'Effie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'regular', 'player', 'trip', 'Hawaii', 'Mama', 'Jeopardy', 'Anne', 'Haney', 'Earl', 'Boen', 'who', 'played', 'ALberta', 'Rev', 'Lloyd', 'Meecham', 'Mama', 'moved', 'life', 'always', 'wondered', 'what', 'happened', 'Buzz', 'Sonja', 'think', 'went', 'mother', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'come', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'trying', 'get', 'Raytown', 'Missouri', 'hold', 'Mama', 'Family', 'Convention.For', 'record', 'season', 'one', 'included', '13', 'episodes', 'aired', 'NBC', 'first', 'season', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'also', 'NBC', 'NBC', 'cancelled', 'show', '1984', 'January', '1986', 'returned', 'again', 'Buzz', 'Sonja', 'Ellen', 'Aunt', 'Fran', 'latter', 'two', 'became', 'famous', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'husband', 'Joe', 'Hamilton', 'were', 'getting', 'divorce', 'Carol', 'Joe', 'did', ""n't"", 'reunite', 'series', 'syndication', 'syndication', 'going', 'first', 'class', 'coach', 'series', 'had', 'make', 'adjustments', 'Bubba', 'played', 'Allan', 'Kayser', 'Iola', 'played', 'Beverly', 'ARcher', 'joined', 'show', 'third', 'season', 'syndication', 'now', 'know', 'what', 'confusion', 'was', 'watch', '13', 'episodes', 'were', 'earliest', 'episodes', 'time']",Mama's Family:  Season 1
