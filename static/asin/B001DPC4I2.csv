Rey,"[0, 0]","As a saxophonist/conga player who is now learning electric bass I found this video to be an outstanding learning tool for musicians who concentrate too much on technique and not enough on feel and the groove. One old blues musician told me that evey musician should learn to play the blues to get the ""feeling"" of popular music and once you had that foundation, you would be able to play any form of music: jazz, reggae, pup, salsa, rock, R&B, whatever, with soul and technique that was tasteful. This video is definitely related to what that blues musician told me. As a saxophone/conga player some of the ""tricks"" Victor mentioned I have been doing for years, nevertheless the way he put it into words was impressive. His chapter about rhythm and tempo is very informative and again all musicians could use the exercises he has the other musicians do in this master class. Every chapter of the video had useful information for playing ""in the pocket"". For bass players I think this is a must have for your learning bass collection. Again I'll say that all musicians can benefit from watching this video.",5,Great concepts for any musician regardless of instrument,1375488000,"08 3, 2013",2013,1105,"['saxophonist/conga', 'player', 'who', 'now', 'learning', 'electric', 'bass', 'found', 'video', 'be', 'outstanding', 'learning', 'tool', 'musicians', 'who', 'concentrate', 'too', 'much', 'technique', 'not', 'enough', 'feel', 'groove', 'One', 'old', 'blues', 'musician', 'told', 'musician', 'should', 'learn', 'play', 'blues', 'get', 'feeling', 'popular', 'music', 'once', 'had', 'foundation', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'play', 'form', 'music', 'jazz', 'reggae', 'pup', 'salsa', 'rock', 'R', 'B', 'whatever', 'soul', 'technique', 'was', 'tasteful', 'video', 'definitely', 'related', 'what', 'musician', 'told', 'saxophone/conga', 'player', 'tricks', 'Victor', 'mentioned', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'years', 'nevertheless', 'way', 'put', 'words', 'was', 'impressive', 'chapter', 'rhythm', 'tempo', 'very', 'informative', 'again', 'musicians', 'could', 'use', 'exercises', 'other', 'musicians', 'do', 'master', 'class', 'chapter', 'video', 'had', 'useful', 'information', 'playing', 'pocket', 'bass', 'players', 'think', 'must', 'have', 'learning', 'bass', 'collection', 'Again', ""'ll"", 'say', 'musicians', 'can', 'benefit', 'watching', 'video']",Victor Wooten: Groove Workshop

Victor and Anthony's breakdown of ten individual elements of music goes so far beyond the typical ""play an A7 arpeggio over a G7 chord to get all the sweet extensions"" advice you get from most music books. This clinic takes you far down the rabbit hole and WAY beyond what is ever written on a sheet of music.

He speaks of music being a language, and how you should have something to convey when you are playing.

If you're thinking of taking up any instrument and know virtually nothing about music, watch this video first! This video was a complete reawakening to me of what I'm trying to do learning music. If you're reading this you probably, as I do, consider Victor Wooten among the top five living bass players. I hoped simply to watch the self analysis of a master performer. This video is vastly more than that. Wooten starts out with defining music as a form of communication and then asks, ""How did you first learn to communicate?"" He looks at the remarkable success rate of humans learning to speak a first language and compares it to the frustration for most people of approaching music classes. Do we ask a baby to recite the alphabet before we teach them their first words? Wooten asks the participants what notes are in a G minor key? He proceeds to play a bass solo in G minor using only notes NOT in G minor. Then he plays one in the G minor scale. The first solo sounds better. Wooten's point is that music is not about notes. Notes may actually be the least important part of playing music. This is one of the most thought provoking music lessons I've ever taken, primarily because it asks me to STOP THINKING when I'm playing.
