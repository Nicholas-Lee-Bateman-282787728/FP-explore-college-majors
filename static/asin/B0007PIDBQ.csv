I love not only the old characters but also the new characters! Zugor, an old ape who is very lovely and funny is one of my favourite new character. The sentence which he always say is ""Boo-hoo for you"". When he say this, his face is very lovely! Uto is big but silly, Kago is rude but very silly too! I love Tantor very much, his face and voice are very lovely. I don't believe that Terkina is a girl, she is playful and... can I say that she is rude? Tarzan is a good boy, he saved his mother near the fall and the cliff! How brave he is!!! And the music in this movie is good too! ""Who am I?"" is perfect. ""Leave alone"" and the old song ""Son of man"" are beautiful too! I love this movie so much.

886857,A3OCO2VYXPPJ9W,B0007PIDBQ,"Any - Ren He ""Princess Kiara""","[1, 3]","I watched this movie when about 1 week after it was published. I thought it was good when I first watched it, but now I don't. However, this movie was not very bad, I just don't like it as I used to do.The story and every plot was funny, and they made me laugh. But by all accounts, it was not a very excellent movie, it was only a comedy. Maybe I was affected by the remarks from many friends, then I watched this movie again, in order to find some defects of this movie. Needless to say, somewhat, I found.Firstly, the story was not very good except it was funny. It was not like the original, it wasn't touching, none of the plots could make me feel warm or make my eyes wet. And I couldn't find the theme of this movie, sometimes I felt it was a little confused. What worse, sometimes I felt it strayed from the point. But it doesn't matter, maybe there was no point.Secondly, I thought the tableaux of this movie were colorful, but not very smooth. The best of the tableaux was, at the end of the movie, young Tarzan swang through the jungle, everything on the backdrop was beautiful and natural. However, it's still not good enough.Finally, I thought the music in this movie was not so good, though I couldn't say it was terrible. I doubted that whether Disney lazed, and Phil Collins did not so good as he used to do. Only ""Who Am I"" was good after a fashion. And the scores were not as good as the original's.Generally speaking, this movie was much better than ""Tarzan&Jane;"", but couldn't be compared with ""Lady and the Tramp-2: Scamp's Adventure"".",3,Shall I rank it 2 stars or 3??,1144972800,"04 14, 2006",2006,1557,"['watched', 'movie', 'when', 'about', '1', 'week', 'was', 'published', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'However', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'bad', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'used', 'do.The', 'story', 'plot', 'was', 'funny', 'made', 'laugh', 'accounts', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'excellent', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'comedy', 'Maybe', 'was', 'affected', 'remarks', 'many', 'friends', 'then', 'watched', 'movie', 'again', 'order', 'find', 'defects', 'movie', 'Needless', 'say', 'somewhat', 'found.Firstly', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'funny', 'was', 'not', 'original', 'was', ""n't"", 'touching', 'none', 'plots', 'could', 'make', 'feel', 'warm', 'make', 'eyes', 'wet', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'theme', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'felt', 'was', 'little', 'confused', 'What', 'worse', 'sometimes', 'felt', 'strayed', 'point', ""n't"", 'matter', 'maybe', 'was', 'point.Secondly', 'thought', 'tableaux', 'movie', 'were', 'colorful', 'not', 'very', 'smooth', 'best', 'tableaux', 'was', 'end', 'movie', 'young', 'Tarzan', 'swang', 'jungle', 'everything', 'backdrop', 'was', 'beautiful', 'natural', 'However', 'still', 'not', 'good', 'enough.Finally', 'thought', 'music', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'could', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'terrible', 'doubted', 'Disney', 'lazed', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'did', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'used', 'do', 'Only', 'Who', 'Am', 'was', 'good', 'fashion', 'scores', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'good', ""original's.Generally"", 'speaking', 'movie', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'Tarzan', 'Jane', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'compared', 'Lady', 'Tramp-2', 'Scamp', 'Adventure']",N/A

886859,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B0007PIDBQ,blackaciddevil,"[9, 9]","After watching ""Tarzan and Jane"" recently, I wasn't expecting too much out of this sequel to Tarzan. But, lo and behold, Disney did an outstanding job with this one. Tarzan II focuses on a chapter of Tarzan's life as a child, where he realizes he is not an ape and sets out to discover exactly what he is. Despite the things I've heard people say about the movie, I thought it was a great movie. It was humorous, downright hilarious in some parts and, overall, is a real good, feel good movie. Phil Collins is back on board with the sequel providing music for the movie, Glenn Close and Lance Henrikson do as well as the voices of Tarzan's ape parents. I think the thing I liked most about it was the special feature featurette, The Legacy of Tarzan- A Behind-the-scenes glimpse of how Phil Collins created new music for the film and Tarzan's Matter-of-Facts - Viewing mode that features facts and explains novelist Edgar Rice Burroughs' Unique Ape Language. If you have Tarzan, this is one sequel you need in your collection.In my opinion, sequels aren't bad if they're done right. I'll admit, Disney has been somewhat formulaic in its' approach to sequels, as of late. Yet, this is one that they did a good job with. If they can keep up the good work with other sequels, as they did with this, they just might restore my faith in them.",5,Tarzan II.....,1123200000,"08 5, 2005",2005,1337,"['watching', 'Tarzan', 'Jane', 'recently', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'sequel', 'Tarzan', 'lo', 'behold', 'Disney', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'one', 'Tarzan', 'II', 'chapter', 'Tarzan', 'life', 'child', 'where', 'not', 'ape', 'out', 'discover', 'exactly', 'what', 'things', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'people', 'say', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'humorous', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'parts', 'overall', 'real', 'good', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'back', 'board', 'sequel', 'providing', 'music', 'movie', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Lance', 'Henrikson', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'voices', 'Tarzan', 'ape', 'parents', 'think', 'thing', 'liked', 'most', 'was', 'special', 'feature', 'featurette', 'Legacy', 'Tarzan-', 'A', 'Behind-the-scenes', 'glimpse', 'how', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'created', 'new', 'music', 'film', 'Tarzan', 'Matter-of-Facts', 'Viewing', 'mode', 'facts', 'explains', 'novelist', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'Unique', 'Ape', 'Language', 'have', 'Tarzan', 'one', 'sequel', 'need', 'collection.In', 'opinion', 'sequels', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', ""'re"", 'done', 'right', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'Disney', 'been', 'somewhat', 'formulaic', 'approach', 'sequels', 'late', 'one', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'can', 'keep', 'up', 'good', 'work', 'other', 'sequels', 'did', 'just', 'might', 'restore', 'faith']",N/A

I guess it's about Tarzan learning who he really is and that, although he is different from the other apes, his family still needs him....no matter what. Not a bad story over-all....if it had been played out a little nicer.The characters aren't exactly what you'd call ""endearing"".

It serves no real purpose other than to reiterate that the filmmakers continued to see Tarzan as an inept kid.  That he moped, was bullied, unappreciated, and took advantage of an unfortunate event to pretend he was dead and gone.  ""We're better off without him.""  He takes the Tom Sawyer route off into the wilds where he meets several new characters, all rancorous.  The theme of this piece is that Tarzan is the odd one out, that he doesn't belong, isn't part of the family, that he's too slow.  ""He's a menace!""  He soon comes to realize, ""I'm not a good ape,"" thanks to a steady pounding of that sentiment throughout (this had all the makings of a bad flashback for the poor kid).  Even in his new location he's portrayed as a perpetual screw-up, unappreciated.  The Zugor tells him that he can't teach Tarzan to be something he's not, making the kid even more desperate to prove his worth and to find out who (or what) he is.  At least they allowed him to find out who his real friends are.  Which did not alter the rigorous dislike the rest of his ""family"" still has for him.  This is hardly a positive message.  People should not have to prove their worth to be accepted.Otherwise, not a bad effort for a direct to DVD release.  There's enough humor, thanks to a germophobic elephant named Tantor.

In part II, before Tarzan meet his future wife Jane Porter and faced his greatest enemy Queen La, he was a ten-year-old human boy who lived a life in the jungle with his family of apes, being cared for by his loving mother Kala(Close) and trying to prove himself to his demanding father Kerchak(Lance Hendrikson, Millennium)and having fun with his pals Terk and Tantor. When Tarzan made a innocent mistake, he cause a calamity in the jungle, which resulted in Tarzan leaving his home, In his journey, he meets Zugor(Carlin), who some believed to be a great mysterious force of the jungle, but turned out to be a cranky, but lovable old gray ape. Along the way, Zugor taught Tarzan that no matter what, he has a family that loves him, which has helped him to become the lord of the jungle. The special features include a behind-the-scenes look of the film, an interview with Phil Collins on the music of Tarzan II and a music video performed by Tiffany Evans, as well as sneak peeks of Disney DVD favourites like Kronk's New Groove, Valiant, and That's So Raven.

886875,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,B0007PIDBQ,Israel Drazin,"[1, 1]","This delightful animated Tarzan film is not a continuation of Tarzan 1. It dramatizes an episode when Tarzan was young, when Tarzan began to realize that he is radically different than the other apes. He plays with his ape friends and discovers that he is not as fast or as agile as they are. When the apes move across a tree above a very deep space, Tarzan is unable to keep up, the tree falls with Tarzan on it, and all, including his ape mother, are convinced that he is dead. He crawls back up and before entering the encampment overhears the apes saying that it is probably for the best that he was killed because if he lived he would have been a danger to the tribe. He begins to think that his friends and family, the apes, are better off without him. He runs away without telling anyone, including his mother, that he is alive. He has several adventures. He meets a very funny ape family, a mother ape and two sons, one very ferocious and the other timid and dull. He also meets and spends some time with an old ape who scares others by making believe that he is a monster. This old ape helps Tarzan realize that he has skills.

Plus the Alladin sequels weren't that bad either. In Tarzan 2, young Tarzan struggles to  in keeping up with the Gorillas. He almost dies and his mother thinks he died. He gets ready to tell her otherwise when he overhears some say the mom is better off now without him. So he sets off on his own to figure out what he is and what species he belongs with. He meets a grumpy old gorilla who scares other creatures off by making them think he's some scary creature. Tarzan promises he won't tell everyone the creature is just an old gorilla if he helps him figure out what he is.The result is a harmless, cute and charming film that won't make you forget the first one but will still entertain you. Plus it helps that Phil Collins is back doing the songs once again. His songs help enhance the film a lot as well. I think this one could've actually have been released in theatres it was so well done. I mean come on Disney does need to go back to releasing more traditional animated movies in theatres. But they also need to be more original with them. I mean this was good but there's way too many sequels these days. I mean a sequel to the Hunchback of Notre Dame ? What's next Sleeping Beauty 2: The Second Nap ? For one I wouldn't mind seeing them make movies based on their cartoon series. I mean who wouldn't want Gummi Bears to be brought back with a few movies by Disney ?

Well this is what else takes place during that time.And during that time, there is an accident in which Kala is hurt and Tarzan is thought off as having died. Lucky for him he hasn't and he plans on returning to them. That is until he overhears family members saying that Kala would probably be better without him- so Tarzan runs away...I have to be honest, I pretty much hate the Disney straight to video/DVD sequels. The animation is terrible, the story is almost as bad and the songs are uninspired. Then in 2004, Disney released The Lion King 1/2, and it was a step in the right direction. Tarzan II continues that step.The animation is almost as good as the original and the few songs here are excellent. There is a newer, much shorter, version of ""Son of Man"", and the savior of this movie is the song ""Who Am I?"". The story became a little weak after the first 20 minutes but it was quite acceptable.The DVD has Disney fastplay, games, a featurette and the music video for ""Who Am I"" performed by the amazing young singer Tiffany Evans.

As a late teenager, I can watch the original Tarzan while being entertained and catch the sentimental meanings behind it, but this version did not hold my attention, along with my younger brother.
