This is no hero, more a stooge of larger forces, like the Columbian gangs he introduced to American markets, and American law.Johnny Depp gives his character the raw edge, the off-center determination to succeed at all costs, but also poignancy. Only we never learn where his flair for ideas comes from. His dysfunctional family makes him human, but there is a dimension to his character that is missing. Is it just middle-class industriousness twisted into illegal ambition for lack of another outlet?Paul Rubens gives the movie some notoriety, but his role is not that pivotal, nor his role memorable. It is Depp, operating in his character's mystery zone, that delivers and carries the whole effort. The story is the heart of the movie, and could perhaps have been more documentary and less personalized without losing its focus: the American fairy tale",4,Another American Story,1010707200,"01 11, 2002",2002,1086,"['easy', 'feel', 'compassion', 'George', 'Jung', 'BLOW', 'certainly', 'stoke', 'compassion', 'true', 'quality', 'movie', 'way', 'classic', 'American', 'tale', 'ambition', 'greed', 'everyman', 'small', 'man', 'hero', 'more', 'stooge', 'larger', 'forces', 'Columbian', 'gangs', 'introduced', 'American', 'markets', 'American', 'law.Johnny', 'Depp', 'character', 'raw', 'edge', 'off-center', 'determination', 'succeed', 'costs', 'also', 'poignancy', 'Only', 'never', 'learn', 'where', 'flair', 'ideas', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'human', 'dimension', 'character', 'missing', 'just', 'middle-class', 'industriousness', 'twisted', 'illegal', 'ambition', 'lack', 'outlet', 'Paul', 'Rubens', 'movie', 'notoriety', 'role', 'not', 'pivotal', 'role', 'memorable', 'Depp', 'operating', 'character', 'mystery', 'zone', 'delivers', 'whole', 'effort', 'story', 'heart', 'movie', 'could', 'perhaps', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'documentary', 'less', 'personalized', 'losing', 'focus', 'American', 'fairy', 'tale']",N/A

538743,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00003CXWU,Alex Udvary,"[1, 1]","Is it Ted Demme's fault that Martin Scorsese came out before him? Of course not! But, we can't help but think back on Scorsese's films, mostly because we've seen what happens in &quot;Blow&quot; in movies like &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and &quot;Casino&quot;. It's the same old premise with movies like these. Small town kid who grew up poor, decides that he will make it big one day. He later then gets involved with the wrong group of people. He or she finds that they can make quick easy money by either selling drugs, or getting involved in gambling or owning a casino, as long as they have all the angles figured out. Once they get a small taste of this new lifestyle they automatically want more, and there's always someone around who knows how to help them. Later we find that they now have a big house, lots of cars, meet beautiful women, and have more money than they know what to do with. There's actually a scene in this movie where Depp's character and a friend have a apartment room that is full of boxes and this those boxes it's filled with money! Now, once they get to the top, everything must crumble. That's the premise this film takes. We learn about George Jung (Johnny Depp), a poor kid who rew up watching his father work hard all his life, but it was never good enough for his mother. She would constantly leave them, telling his father (Ray Liotta) that they need more money. After seeing the way his father had to struggle George decides that that will not ever happen to him. He soon goes away to the west coast, it's here he first comes into contact with drugs, and it will ultimately change his life, for better and worst! George soons discovers what sort of demand there is on drugs. He starts selling his own stuff which he gets from Derek Foreal (Paul Reubens! Who actually delivers quite an amusing performance). As the film later goes on George is caught for carry over 600 pounds of the stuff with him. When in jail he meets Diego Degado (Jordi Molla) who knows a thing or two about the drug business himself. Once he gets out of prison with the help of Diego, George now is amazing importing 85% of all cocaine that enters the U.S.! To steal a line from Maxwell Smart, would you believe it? 85%! The screenplay by David McKenna, and Nick Cassavetes based on the book by Bruce Poter, which of course is based on the actually life of George Jung is amazing. The writters have managed to display all of Jung's bad sides and still have us at times pulling for him. The first hour of this movie blew me away! I enjoyed it so much. If I could only review the first hour I would give it 4 stars. It's not that the movie is long, but the film takes an unexpected turn. But you can't blame the film for this. If that's what happened in real life to George Jung, what can you do? &quot;Blow&quot; is a very interesting story that I think people are going to want to see. It's a well made film that had very good acting by Depp. It's not as entertaining as &quot;Goodfellas&quot; or &quot;Casino&quot; but it stands very well on it's own. And that's all that counts.

538748,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00003CXWU,Andy Orrock,"[2, 5]","What I liked about 'Blow' was the intersection of protagonist George Jung's life with kingpins like Pablo Escobar.  These events help put into perspective the dangerous game that Jung was playing.  The introduction of Escobar into the tale (and what an intro) is meant to show the Johnny Depp's character has crossed a threshold from lifetyle choice into serious nacrotrafficking.What's strange about 'Blow' is some of the casting choices.  The late Ted Demme obviously liked to go against the grain.  I can respect that.  The Johnny Depp of 2000 was known for his risky role-taking, so having him carry the lead isn't a problem (and, as a native Bostonian, I think he put on a fairly credible Massachusetts accent...certainly light-years better than Laura Linney's savage botch job in 'Mystic River'). And, Jordi Moll&agrave; is outstanding as he is everything he does.But Kiwi Cliff Curtis (of subsequent 'Whale Rider' fame) as Escobar?  Maori...Antioquian...what's the difference.  What an odd choice.Likewise, getting me to buy off on Ray Liotta as Depp's father (eight years in age difference between the two) was a stretch.  Liotta looked 45 throughout the film (his age at the time), regardless of the amount he spent in the make-up trailer.And, 'Blow' was another in a string of movies from that period (along with 'Woman on Top,' 'All the Pretty Horses' and 'Vanilla Sky') designed in part to force-feed Penelope Cruz down the throats of the American public and make her a bankable Hollywood star.

He portrays a man, who fearing poverty as a boy, makes all the wrong choices in obtaining wealth - first as a marijuana importer and finally as the kingpin in the rise of the cocaine empire.  Because he is a decent sort of fellow, not a monster, he is ousted by his Latin American contacts and winds up three times in prison, where he remains today, serving a sixty year sentence, until his planned release in 2015.It isn't until 42 minutes into the two hour film that cocaine even enters the picture (suggested by his cell mate during his first stay in prison, once he learns of George's marijuana empire). Jordi Molla as the cell mate, Diego, delivers the best performance in the film. He is riveting in all of his guises as friend, confidante, opportunity provider, and ultimate betrayer.  Equally good in support are Rachel Griffiths as George's loud mouthed, bitter mother and Ray Liotta as his long loving and long suffering father - a poignant betrayal.Unfortunately, the film has little value other than providing a history lesson in the rise of cocaine as an underworld marketing empire.  TRAFFIC is an interesting companion film to see.  Depp is most affecting in his last scenes, now sporting a paunch and dirty long hair, delusionally expecting his daughter's visit, an event which never occurs.The problem with the film in my opinion is that it lacks tension - it is too matter of fact.  We never see George's ambition - he is always too calm about everything that happens to him, good and bad.  We care about him but we don't engage with his character.  It is a marketing lie to show Penelope Cruz as his co-star. She doesn't appear in the film until the second half and then only in a few scenes as his second wife, a foul-mouthed five letter word.To sum up, it's a valuable history lesson but not great film.",2,A lesson in how NOT to live your life,1194739200,"11 11, 2007",2007,1909,"['George', 'Jung', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'dons', 'long', 'blonde', 'hair', 'Boston', 'accent', 'dark', 'glasses', 'man', 'who', 'fearing', 'poverty', 'boy', 'wrong', 'choices', 'obtaining', 'wealth', 'first', 'marijuana', 'importer', 'finally', 'kingpin', 'rise', 'cocaine', 'empire', 'decent', 'sort', 'fellow', 'not', 'monster', 'ousted', 'Latin', 'American', 'contacts', 'up', 'three', 'times', 'prison', 'where', 'today', 'serving', 'sixty', 'year', 'sentence', 'planned', 'release', '2015.It', ""n't"", '42', 'minutes', 'two', 'hour', 'film', 'cocaine', 'even', 'picture', 'suggested', 'cell', 'mate', 'first', 'stay', 'prison', 'once', 'George', 'marijuana', 'empire', 'Jordi', 'Molla', 'cell', 'mate', 'Diego', 'best', 'performance', 'film', 'riveting', 'guises', 'friend', 'confidante', 'opportunity', 'provider', 'ultimate', 'betrayer', 'Equally', 'good', 'support', 'are', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'George', 'loud', 'mouthed', 'bitter', 'mother', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'long', 'loving', 'long', 'suffering', 'father', 'poignant', 'betrayal.Unfortunately', 'film', 'little', 'value', 'other', 'providing', 'history', 'lesson', 'rise', 'cocaine', 'underworld', 'marketing', 'empire', 'TRAFFIC', 'interesting', 'companion', 'film', 'see', 'Depp', 'most', 'affecting', 'last', 'scenes', 'now', 'sporting', 'paunch', 'dirty', 'long', 'hair', 'delusionally', 'expecting', 'daughter', 'visit', 'event', 'never', 'occurs.The', 'problem', 'film', 'opinion', 'tension', 'too', 'matter', 'fact', 'never', 'see', 'George', 'ambition', 'always', 'too', 'calm', 'everything', 'good', 'bad', 'care', 'do', ""n't"", 'engage', 'character', 'marketing', 'lie', 'show', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'co-star', ""n't"", 'appear', 'film', 'second', 'half', 'then', 'only', 'few', 'scenes', 'second', 'wife', 'foul-mouthed', 'five', 'letter', 'word.To', 'sum', 'up', 'valuable', 'history', 'lesson', 'not', 'great', 'film']",N/A

Johnny Depp, as usual, has the art of character acting down to a fine art.Depp plays George Jung, an ambitious kid who became a drug czar in America in the 1970's and 1980's. He came from a working class background where his father (Ray Liotta) worked like a slave to support the family. The catalyst was when his father filed for bankruptcy, and there Geroge vowed never to live in poverty. He moved to California, made connections, including a flamboyant hairdresser (Paul Reubens, in a standout role), and started the drug trend in America that ""exploded like an atomic bomb"". The movie has it's share of ups and downs, and George learns that maybe drug dealing isn't a wise career choice. He only learns this through a series of betrayls and blunders.""Blow"" is directed in a retro style similar to that of ""Boogie Nights"". The wild music, the over-the-top acting and characterization, and the stylish dialogue. While heavily dramatized, ""Blow"" is based on a true story, and according to the real Geroge Jung, was pretty accurate. Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz both excell themselves in their excellent performances. Ted Demme, who died after ""Blow"" was released, did an excellent job. He was definitely a rising star in the Director's Guild.The Infinifilm DVD package is a must own.

Simple: the filmakers manage to make you feel sympathetic for George Jung and that, to me, is pretty amazing.  Here's a guy who's wrecked millions of lives by distributing and selling cocaine over many years(inbetween prison stints) and 'we' manage to feel sorry for the guy.  One example would be the scene where George talks to his wife over the prison phones.  She drops the phone, walks away and his young daughter appears standing in the back looking at him.  He talks to his daughter, who is angry at him, and after she walks away, George looks up at his wife and violently hits the phone against the glass.  Very moving scene... but remember we are talking about a DRUG DEALER(!). Depp is incredible in this, the way he makes you feel sorry for his character, who wants to spend time with his young daughter and manages to keep breaking promises to her.  But ultimately it's himself that did him in and he ends up right where he belongs.  Prison.  I think years down the line Depp will be recognized for this film, not to mention Paul 'Pee Wee Herman' Ruebens and Ray Liotta.  Great movie, not so great human beings(in the movie).

Director Ted Demme who sadly passed away shortly after filming was completed painted a real and all too scary account of of a man who scored big and made millions as one of the biggest cocaine dealers in the 70's but like everthing that is illegal crashed and burned in a spectacular and sad way. BLOW, is the true story of George Jung who as a young boy watched as his parents fought over money and lived O.K. but nothing out of the ordinary. One day when his father lost his job and had to file for bankruptcy young George said to his father that he &quot;never wanted to be poor&quot; to which his father responded &quot;than you won't&quot;. Jung, wanted a lot of money and he wanted fast without going thru the trials and tribulations of getting a real &quot;decent&quot; job and settle for a less than ordinary life. This film is excellent but a little tough to watch especially as Jung's life and glitzly world of money and coke spirals out of control and worst of all gets turned over to the police by those he thought were his friends. Johnny Depp is the main reason to see this movie, here he gives his greatest performance yet and he is compelling as he is beliveable as Jung. You sometimes feel sorry for him, you know that he's done wrong but thru it all he is really not a bad guy just got caught up in a life that moves too fast and too dangerous. Depp, again will leave you spellbound and it proves that he is not just another pretty face by Hollywood standards but an intense and gifted actor who is also extremely versatile.

Thus, this movie had a good head start on its rating with his being the lead. Depp does a really good acting job of delivering the whole portrait of a real life drug dealer who is still in prison today.  His primary motivation is that his father never has enough money for the family in the years that he is growing up. This is not a tremendously sympathetic &quot;hook&quot; though as lots of people with similar backgrounds have gone into legitimate professions or occupations to pull themselves up from their bootstraps. Ray Liotta does a fabulous job as Depp's father and may even eclipse Depp's performance in the movie.  Naturally Depp has to marry someone from a drug family and that woman is played by Penelope Cruz, a lovely enough woman but nothing special (so far) in the acting department.

It's two days later, and I've already watched it three times, including the infinifilm inserts. I'm a big fan of Johnny Depp, but that's not it. I love the music, but that's not it. And I'm no big fan of cocaine.I like the movie because it does not glorify, nor does it condemn, drug use per se. In many ways it just is, and has been, for a very long time. It has a lot to do with the 'market' that exists, and that has been exploited for the money.I loved Jung's relationship with his father, as it was portrayed. His father did not understand what he was doing, but did not judge him. It was clear to me that, at least as the story was told in the movie, Jung was trying to make enough money to keep the women in his life happy, having experienced recurring abandonment by his mother over the issue of money. Drugs are, if nothing else, about money and power. Just ask anyone in the government who will tell you.I also liked the awareness I got about the drug economy in Colombia, a basically poor country without the economy of drugs. Dig a little deeper, though you won't find the information in this movie, and you will know why. My country creates these economies, and then exploits them. Why? For money and power. This is supposed to be a democracy, but nobody asked me. I would have voted against anything like that. Lots of people would, if they understood it.At a time when the cocaine explosion took off, there was a great deal of support for it. Without that support, it would not have happened. It then got corrupted, but you would have to read the book *Barry and the Boys* to see how that happened.Still and all, though, I liked the message of the movie. There is money and power in the industry, but it costs a lot more than it is worth, depending on what you value. It's a powerful movie, though perhaps not for everyone.I particularly liked the cameo appearance by Bobcat Goldthwaite. I didn't even recognize him until the third time around. He doesn't look good.

It's not as stunning or as 'Traffic', but I highly recommend it.I must say that some critical observations about the film being too sympathetic to Jorge's character are very valid.  The film is definitely told from the perspective of the protagonist, and that protagonist is a man who introduced serious drugs, and the subsequent addictions and deaths as a result of this introduction of drugs, to the country. And the film didn't really ever point out the irony of that.  Instead, you walk out feeling kinda bad for this guy who has ruined thousands of lives. It's nothing that you notice while watching the film, but afterwards, when you stop and think about it, it is puzzling. If you can get past that issue, you probably will enjoy the film more. I went into the film with that on my mind, and promtly forgot about it until the lights came up.Johnny Depp is excellent. I was *not* a Johnny Depp fan at all before this. Although I have been impressed by his performances, all the talk about him being one of the most important actors of this time were just not resonating with me. Now maybe I get what all the fuss is about. His performance was so straight and subtle. I definitely have a new view of his talent.I don't get what the buzz about Penelope Cruz is, as I was not impressed by her at all in this film. Every time she was on screen I cringed because she was so over the top. Franka Potente (Lola in 'Run Lola, Run'), on the other hand, was wonderful as Barbara. She stole the first half of the film. I wish she featured more prominently in the cast listing.Paul Reubens (Pee Wee Herman) was also impressive- I had no idea how he was going to pull this role off without it being made campy, but he did it.All in all, I loved this film. The cinematography and editing were fast and sort of cliche, but that added to the whole attitude of the production.

Then one day I find myself watching it and being riveted by the story and Johnny Depp's performance.Depp plays George Jung who according to the film hooked up with Pablo Escobar and the Colombia drug cartel to bring cocaine into the U.S. Jung was responsible for the cocaine explosion in the 70s and 80s by providing a better product than had been available before. Jung makes millions, gets married to a crazy latin woman played by Penelope Cruz and is living (no pun intended) the high life.Eventually there are plenty of betrayals and paranoia and Jung gets out of the business and tries to live a normal life with his wife and daughter. But when he needs money he goes back to the only thing he knows, smuggling coke which leads to several arrests, the last with a sentence of 60 years.I guess part of the reason that movies like this are fascinating is that you know there are people like Jung out there doing these things, but its enlightening when you get to see how they did it and the effect it had on their lives.

Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[1, 4]","Based on the book: Blow: How a Small-Town Boy Made 100 million with the Medllin Cocaine Cartel and Lost is All' by Bruce Porter, Blow is an overly familiar, overly slick, docu-drama of  real life legendary drug dealer George Jung's life. It's a second rate cable movie with Johnny Depp added to upgrade the package.  The film seems all set up to be an interesting character study, but the character is too bland to be very interesting and everything about the story is overly familiar.  The few opportunities the film sets up are squandered beneath the stylistic re-treads and multiple montages that we've seen used much more effective in films like: Scorcese's Good Fellas and Casino;  in De Palma's Scarface and in Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights.However, you might find enough redeeming value in the film's good performances which include worthwhile work from Ray Liotta, Johnny Depp, Cliff Curtis (who too briefly plays Escobar) and  Franka Potente (the Run Lola Run star making her American feature film debut here).  If you can somehow overlook all of the recycled ideas borrowed from the Scorcese/Tarantino/Anderson/De Palma stylistic tricks and homage to great directors of the past book... you might not find the film the pointless waste of time that I found it to be.That said the DVD does have some much better than average extras, the documentary on the effects of cocaine on Colombia is very well done, the interview with currently imprisoned real life George Jung are among the highlights.If the subject matter , the rise and fall of drug dealer holds any interest, the extras on the disc are definitely worth seeing.  In fact the extras are far more interesting and compelling than the film is itself.  You can watch the extras integrated into the film via the Infini-film gimmick (previously used in the 13  Weeks, and 15 minutes DVD's) or Separately accessible via the menu options.

We see Jung's childhood and how, despite the best efforts of his father (Ray Liotta), his son's life (and Jung's own opportunity to be a good father) went crazily out of control. And at the end, we are shown that involvement in the narcotics business is not compatible with fatherhood. The movie asks to be judged on that moral conclusion, even though the subject could have explored in various other directions, it only briefly touches on other themes. The morality and consequences of creating a culture of addiction is barely explored- not that I think the movie is obliged to address that, but the viewer should be aware that the subject is not explored, and was a bit disappointing in that area.  It doesn't go after big, grandiose themes of greed and betrayal like in Scarface, in part because Jung doesn't have an epic tragic end, he just fails when he tries to do some right things too late. After making moral compromises, he is unable to put anything in his life right. At least in the movie's version of the events, Jung could have started a drug war to defend his ""honor"" and status among the cocaine dealers, but instead he drops out and is punished with the consequences of doing so. It occurred to me during the film that, ironically, he might have had better opportunities of being a better father if he were a more ruthless, vengeful figure in the vicious business of drug dealing. Like real life, the moral choices are messy and untidy and not satisfying. Maybe if the film focussed more tightly on the themes of redemption and forgiveness, it would have been a great film.

Johnny Depp stars as George Jung, a small time pot dealer who after taking his first collar flees on bail and winds up serving hard time.  As it turns out prision does little to deter his appetite for his profession (that is if you consider drug dealing a &quot;profession&quot;) and after five years inside he promotes himself to cocaine, which at the time was pretty obscure in the states.The first half hour of the film deals with his humble beginnings as a child, which leads him to make a deal with himself that he'll never be poor like his father whose been made to live from paycheck to paycheck all of his life.  So as soon as he's old enough he flees to California with his lumbersome friend Tuna (Ethan Suplee of American History X) and the two take up dealing on the beach.  They're brought into the business after meeting a bisexual hairstylist with an antrepreneurial spirit (Paul &quot;Pee Wee&quot; Reubens), whom they're introduced to through George's girlfriend, Barbra.Being as it's the 60's and the marketplace has exploded they move the &quot;stuff&quot; with ease, until they decide to expand eastward.  Getting enough pot to supply the New England states and then finding a way to transport it there proves to be difficult.  But George's ambition won't let little details like this get in the way of his dream of financial independence.  So he steals a plane, flies over the boarder, flies back, and lands in an uninhabited desert out in the middle of nowhere.  It's really very clever and given that Johnny's such a charismatic character we're rooting for him all the way.But if things were always great for George a movie wouldn't have been made about his life.  He's caught with two suitcases of marijuana at O'Hare in Chicago and while he's out on bond discovers that Barbra's dying of cancer and will likely die while he's incarcerated.  Faced with a moral dilemma George does the noble thing (or at least in my mind anyway) and flees to Mexico with Barbra so that he can see her through her final days.  And upon returning home his image-conscious, money-driven mother gives him up to the police.It's then, while serving out this sentence, that George meets up with a Columbian cellmate who introduces him to the world of cocaine smuggling.  As he puts it, &quot;I went in with a bachelor's in pot and came out with a master's in coke.&quot;  After being paroled just three years into his five year term, George begins running errands for his new found partner which eventually lands him a duffel bag full of blow.  With serious money staring him right in the eye, he violates parole, returns to Los Angeles and discovers that the demand for his product has skyrocketed, now in the 1970's.  He's moves three hundred thousand dollars of nose candy in just three days.So now he needs a Columbian connection, leading him into a professional friendship with the now infamous Pablo Escobar (vividly potrayed by Three King's Cliff Curtis), and the two team up to puportedly supply eighty-five percent of the country's coke (I wonder if that's including the handiwork of Ronald Reagan and company during Iran-Contra?).  Either way this is an extraordinary entertaining movie that since I've seen it I just can't stop thinking about.Johnny Depp is nothing short of a marvel as George, keeping the ship afloat during the lulls in the story and breaking our hearts at it's conclusion.  You know you've seen something special when after watching a film about a remoreseless drug dealer you're wiping away a tear that you've shed on his behalf.

Basically, this movie is about a guy named George Jung who was the first american to smuggle cocaine into the US.It shows his life story from humble beginnings in dope selling to the high rolling stakes of cocaine smuggling. As to the reason why this filmed surprised me ? It is because I wasn&#65533;t interested in the fact that cocaine had dealt the US with a major drug problem, rather the plight of George Jung himself ( and his parents ) and what he was like.At best, this movie portrayed George Jung as a humble kid who turned into a drug lord ( in which he deserved what he got ). Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz and the two Aussie actors Cliff Curtis and Rachel Griffiths played their characters well enough for all of us to believe that George Jung was only trying to earn a living at what he did best: selling drugs.Look, I did like the movie and the characters but am a tad suspicious as to how an audience is to react to a movie like this ?

Johnny Depp is at it again playing Jung with a vulnerability that's easy to like. Ray Liotta co-stars as Jung's father. A man who tried as hard as he could, but never quite made it. Jung's mother ( played so good by Rachel Griffiths) is the example of what happens when a child doesn't exceed the potential of a parent.After being caught with 660 pounds of marijuana and sent to prison for 26 months, Jung meets Diego. A Columbian who has a dream of bringing cocaine to the mainstream and getting rich while doing so. When Jung gets released he comes into contact with Diego and the great Pablo Escobar. The three form a partnership and everyone is filthy rich. However, Diego steals Jung's &quot;California Connection&quot; played by a welcomed Paul Reubens.Penelope doesn't fit in this movie at all. Almost like a Highlights book. What's wrong with this picture?Overall, this film was a great look into the mindset of a driven person who's ambition far exceeded his talent.

The movie begins with Depp's character as a young lad being taught to do the right thing by his loving, caring father, who also teaches his young son about the facts of life. Depp's boy character also fantasizes about becoming rich, after seeing first-hand his parents financial struggles. Later on in the movie, Depp's character, now an adult, hooks up with an old friend, and they contrive on a get-rich-quick scheme. The two then hook up with another old friend, who is into selling illegal drugs, and the three go into business together. But, when things go dry in the U.S., Depp and friends find themselves heading for Mexico to score yet more deals, and eventually get busted, except for the third party kingpin dealer. Depp then finds himself in hot water and winds up in jail for illegal drug possession, much to the displeasure of his parents, especially his mother, who disowns her own son and attempts to kick Depp's character out of her life. Meanwhile, his father, although he too disapproves of his son's money laundering schemes, tries to talk some sense into Depp's mom, but the father's pleas fall on deaf ears. Depp's further travelled road does not get any easier, for he doesn't win any popularity contests with his young, school aged daughter, and at times, including his wife, played by the talented Penelope Cruz, througout the latter half of the film, and gets busted another time for the same crime. The ending of &quot;Blow&quot; is a must see, and its dramatic ending will most likely leave you in tears.

One suspects that the highly talented Demme desired to confront his own demons while putting together this first rate film.  Johnny Depp aptly portrays George Jung as a man who subtly, but most assuredly chose the path to self destruction.  He is not a victim and deserves no pity.  Is Jung a monster? Perhaps not, but he made his own bed and now has to lie in it.  Jung is greatly responsible for introducing the horror of cocaine into the United States.  He starts out as a typical teenager from a blue collar family.  Jung's father (Ray Liotta) and mother (Rachel Griffiths) raises their family in a struggling middle class environment.  During his early adult years, Jung travels to California and starts enjoying the wild parties, easy sex, and mind altering drugs.  He eventually meets a major drug seller (Paul Reubens) who partners with him to market very large quantities of marijuana.  Common sense dictates that sooner or later Jung will be arrested.  Sadly, however, Jung is not only personally addicted to drugs but also the accompanying risky lifestyle. Rational considerations therefore will not stand in the way of Jung's slide into evil and debauchery.We eventually accompany Jung to Columbia where he is promoted to the major leagues of drug running.  Betrayal and back stabbing become the norm.  He meets and marries Mirtha (Penelope Cruz), a woman is also a coke junkie and out of control pleasure seeker.  Hedonism dominates their lifestyle, and money is so plentiful that neither knows how to spend it all.  They flippantly make large purchases which soon bore them.  Bringing a child into the world does little to encourage prudence.  Their train is going to crash, and one can only hope the collateral damage is minimal.  Our eyes are riveted to the screen as Jung is ultimately brought to a bad end. Ted Demme may have been too conflicted to unambiguously present George Jung as a moral monster deserving of severe punishment, but we never mistake him for some sort of misunderstood folk hero.Blow will force you to wonder if our drug laws make any sense.  Is it truly worth the damage to our political and public institutions to continue criminalizing such activity?  Jung, after all,  may be still be in jail, but his successors remain on the street.  I also recommend Traffic and the utterly fantastic and overlooked masterpiece, Rush.

Anyway, it kind of reminded me of watching Miami Vice, only from the other side and it was fascinating to watch how a small time drug dealer came to have one of the largest drug empires in U.S. History in such a short period of time.  I especially like one of the first scenes when they show cocaine being made in Columbia....leaves are ground up, turned into a paste, spread out on a table to dry, thus turning it into a powder firm which is then measured out to be distributed. It also causes you to feel for the Columbian people who are poor, and thus reliant on exporting this drug for economic survival....makes for a complicated political/moral situation.  I even felt myself feeling a little sorry for George Jung towards the end, but I could have felt more so if he had displayed more emotion throughout the film. It was sad to see his friends of all those years suddenly turn on him in order to save themselves from the Feds.  Just goes to show you what a ruthless business drug dealing is and like his dad said in the begining ""money isn't all that important....it only seems like it is""...this could also be seen when he lost nearly all his money when his foreign bank was taken over by the new government. I was also pleasantly surprised to see that the movie wasn't as overly violent as it could have been given the subject matter...I think only two people were shot during the entire movie. Just goes to show you that a movie doesn't have to rely on violence and gore to be good...a good storyline can support it alone.....other movies today could learn from this.

While the script doesn't portray George as a hero it constantly distorts the truth. For example, early in the film, after George is busted in Chicago with 660 pounds of marijuana, he skips bail supposedly to be with his then girlfriend who allegedly was dying of cancer according to the film. Complete hogwash: she is still alive and was interviewed by the book author of Blow. Moreover, George was never ""faithful"" nor monogamous: he was continually ""shacking up"" with any girl who wanted to get high.I give Johnny Depp credit for taking such a role because it isn't easy playing a loser without any redeemable traits. The best parts of the story are: Panama's Manny Noriega screwing George out of $30 million; George set-up by his long-time friends who previously had been arrested by the Drug Enforcement Agency; and, George in prison imagining his daughter will visit, which is reason alone to watch this movie.

I have been a fan of his for a long time.  I think he is so underrated as an actor, and for those die hard fans of his -- this is worth a viewing.  He is totally mind Blowing in this movie.  Words can not describe how wonderful I truly think this performance is.  If I could pick the Oscar winner for best actor this year, I'd gladly give it to Depp.As far as the movie goes, this is a very fast paced, comedy/drama that has a lot of great music. It's the story of George Jung, who was born and raised in Weymouth, Mass. His parents dreams are shattered when he grows up to be a drug dealer.  Jung didn't want to work a real job, so he got into drugs and selling them as a means to make money, good money.He is hardly a sympathetic character nor is he the greatest person in the world.  He isn't a bad person either, I think.He made very bad choices with his life, and his priorities were totally out of whack.  The film goes through his &quot;career&quot; of being a drug lord and pretty much starting the cocaine trade in the USA.  It's a very interesting and entertaining look into the seedy world of drugs.  &quot;Peewee Herman&quot; aka Paul Reubens is also extremely good in this movie as one of George's first drug dealing friends.  This was a good role for him, and I think he did a great job.Rachel Griffiths (of most recently, Six feet under) and Ray Liotta play George's Parents.  I am from Massachusetts and to hear the Boston accent so poorly acted out by these two was excruiatingly painful.  I like Griffiths, she is a good character actress.  I've never liked Liotta, he is just not a good actor at all in my opinion.BLOW is a good rental.

They signed a terrific lead actor, and a great supporting cast that reminded me dead-on of several people I knew in college.  Very watchable, and a good biography.What keeps it from a higher rating is partially the bad luck of it being released around the time of the far superior ""Traffic"".  But besides telling you that one man was more responsible than others for the explosion of cocaine in this country 25 years ago, there's not much else.  While the movie certainly doesn't portray George Jung as a hero, it is asking for sympathy when things important to him are finally taken away.However, here is a person who did NOTHING but deal drugs for a living all his adult life.  Now I can buy the arguement that he was just supplying what the people wanted, and the purchasers are just as guilty as the supplier.  But there are two problems I have with this.  First, the movie goes to great pains to show that he wasn't necessarily a violent man, although he did carry a gun and threatened people with it.  But his close association with Pablo Escobar, who was a merciless killer, puts Jung big time in guilt by association.  For this I have no sympathy for the man.Second, this guy did his second swing in prison because he was under surveillance for his first pinch.  He knew very well the cops were watching him, yet practically sets himself up for the bust.  With all that, and knowing that the government was REALLY observing him after his second visit to prison, what does he do?  Goes out and becomes part of another big deal. Like Henry Hill in ""Goodfellas"", it never occurs to him that there are other ways to get money, albeit not as quickly.  I think society sometimes has to lock up stupid people to protect them from themselves.Overall, I did like the movie, and recommend it.  But for someone who has lived totally for himself all his life, and in his forties all of a sudden has a child, this doesn't make you a nice person.

He begins his three-decade rise and abrupt fall as a drug lord smuggling pot into the US in his early 20's during the pot-crazed 60's, which garners him an enormous amount of cash.  After landing a lengthy jail sentence, he meets Diego Delgado (Jordi Moll&agrave;) in jail who introduces George to the far more profitable world of cocaine dealing.  He soon shoots to the top of the game and his biggest problem becomes where to put all of his cash.  It is said that if you used cocaine during the 70's and 80's, there's an 85% chance it came from Jung.Over the years he struggles with a crack-addicted wife (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz as you've never seen her before), the relationship with his young daughter, and maintaining his relationship with the only person who truly cares for him in the world, his father.  Additionally, Jung is portrayed in a sympathetic light as a nice guy who just makes some bad decisions.  Usually I disagree with this type of ""glamorization"" of criminals, but I feel that in Jung's case it is truly deserved.""Blow"" is not only the fascinating, pulse-pounding, and historically informative chronicle of the rise and fall of one of America's most influential drug lords; it also the exploration of some very deep personal connections, such as very deep father/son connection between George and his father.  In addition, George's love for his daughter, who ends up being the single thing motivating him to stay alive throughout his jail sentences, delivers a powerful emotional impact in the film's final scenes.  I also appreciated how director Ted Demme delicately showed us the parallels between George's mother's resentment for his father and George's wife's resentment for him after he loses most of his money as well as George's struggle to be a good father just as his own father did.The final scenes of ""Blow"" are surprisingly moving, which ultimately distinguishes it from all of the other crime films out there.",5,&quot;Money isnt real.

I found it hard to sympathize with George Jung's predicament because he's so completely responsible for it.  Am I supposed to feel for a man who sold drugs?  It's not like he was the man stealing bread to feed his family.  Johnny Depp is a great actor, but I wonder how many of these horrible roles he's going to take on.  Even with his charm, I could not bring myself to 1) like George as a character, or 2) like the movie.  The story was pretty standard, something I've seen a dozen times before... only not as good.

538804,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CXWU,"""flickjunkie""","[1, 1]","""Blow"" is a very good biopic on the life of cocaine kingpin George Jung (Johnny Depp) who rose to prominence in the 1980's as one of the largest cocaine traffickers in the United States.  The story is an interesting character study of Jung, who started selling marijuana to pay some bills and found that demand continued to outpace his ability to supply until he had built a cocaine empire.In an interview from prison included on the DVD, Jung states that the story was very true to actual events and that in certain cases it was like a flashback.  Jung appears from this interview to be a hapless soul who was willingly swept along by a riptide of forces that were beyond his sway, which is exactly how Depp portrayed him.Johnny Depp is an excellent character actor who relishes playing odd and offbeat characters.  In this film he gives one of his best and most nuanced performances with a clear understanding of the motivations and circumstances that spun Jung out of control.  He plays Jung with naivet&eacute; rather than giving him the sinister character that one might expect from a drug lord.  After having seen the interview with the real Jung it seems Depp was right on target.Penelope Cruz also expands her horizons, shedding her normally sweet persona to take on the part of Jung's shrewish, drug addicted wife.  Cruz plays the part with great force and emotion, like a woman possessed.  It is a fantastic portrayal of a bitter, self centered woman with a drug problem.Paul Reubens continues his comeback from the ill fated Pee-wee Herman days with a solid portrayal of Derek, the double dealing hair dresser who becomes Jung's primary distributor.  Rachel Griffiths and Ray Liotta also give fine performances as Jung's clueless parents.This character study is well written and sympathetically presented by director Ted Demme.  I rated it an 8/10.

No matter how hard he tries George Jung can never get the approval of his parents, because he is making money illegally.2. The more money Mr. Jung makes, it never seems that he is happy with his life.3. When the characters start using drugs more frequently, you see them start to look worse and worse because of this.4.

His other buddy Derek (Paul Reubens) helped George when he was dealing Pot, also gets involved because he helped George move 50 kilos (110 lbs) of coke in little over one day.

The fact that it was based on a true story?At any rate, back to the film, which is wonderfully shot backed up by great performances from Johnny Depp, Ray Liotta and Jordi Molla. The film is told from a narrative perspective by George Jung (Johnny Depp) tracing the spectacular rise and fall of the pioneering US cocaine distributor of the 1970's / 80's.The film moves seamlessly from George's adolescence to adulthood through a number of locations and vividly captures the essence of that decadent era. The sets, costumes and music all work perfectly.The audience takes an incredible journey, pulled into a world of drug smuggling / distributing, the illusion of 'easy money', ensuing greed and finally betrayal. While many are quick to point out the fact that this person was a &quot;drug dealer&quot; and ponder, &quot;why feel sorry for him?&quot;, this misses the point. His story doesn't search for sympathy from the audience, although it is a sad one. It is an unapologetic look at an unapologetic life.The greatest takeaway from his experience was that he realized too late what was truly important in his life. Simple things, not the money, not the cars, but &quot;real&quot; things as foreshadowed by his father's speech to him as a child.

But why George Jung did it, is really and truly an inspiration!George Jung vowed never to be poor, and he would do whatever it took to make sure that he (and eventually his family) had the best life they possibly could.  Sadly, Jung suffered the consequences after being caught, and ineveitably lost more than his money and freedom.  It is this that makes the story of George Jung so riveting and true to the heart.He did what every red-blooded American wanted to do, make money without really having to work to make it.  Is there anything wrong with that?  No.  Dis he get caught?  Yes.  Was he man enough to stand there and take the punishment?  Absolutely.  Jung may have sacrificed quite a bit, but he did it all, not for him, but for his family; for his daughter.  For that alone, George Jung is really an American hero.Johnny Depp has always been my favorite actor, because of his versatility and ability to make you believe that he ""is"" the character.  No surprise here that Depp puts on a stunning portrayel of Jung!  Also, I'm really not a fan of Paul Ruebens, but his character Derek was amazingly funny, as well as true.The rest of the cast was also just as solid.

I think of a guy with a life full of youth no matter how old he is. In Blow, Liotta plays father to a kid (Johnny Depp) ""George"" and husband to a nagging wife. Liotta played his character with a lot of conviction. It was sad to see an old man listening to a tape recorded by his son. It was also sad to see him play his role as well as he did. To his son, he's the strongest man on earth. His character was extremely well painted & I don't think they could have possibly done any more justice to him.When I would think of Depp, I would think of Edwards Scissorhands.He plays George in this movie and almost every scene in Blow revolves around him. I must say I liked his introduction to the film.This movie is about a kid who grows up watching his mom leave his dad every now and then. They would quarell over money matters and he wished at that time he never was like them. He also decides to never be poor no matter what may come his way.I never thought Penelope Cruz (was almost in love with her) could play the role of a whiny wife as well as she did in Blow. She was good as she managed to make me grind my teeth each time she spoke harshly to George Jung in the prison. I also liked the fiance stealing scenes.Some of the high points of the movie came towards the end. Most films like to conclude with an endnig of dire sorts. Blow has a tragic yet believable ending. Depp became what he hates and it's quite amusing to see him realise at the same time he's lived the life of a man who's ambitions exceed his talent. Yes,I thought the film was about Cocaine but no! it's about the wrong steps a man takes in his life.Another heartbreaking scene was Depp acknowledging the fact that his dad (Liotta) was always right at the age of 42. Money is nothing.Pardon me for the random takes but it's not easy writing a review for Blow. It made me smile and it made me sad but on the whole it was a bit of a lesson in it's own way. Blow had a good ending(appropriate)I would recommend Blow to everyone who doesn't like over mushy endings and for those to whom reality matters.Excellent direction and good screenplay.Enjoy whatever works for you,reader.PS - Wonder what doing blow actually feels like :P",4,"""In Collision With Every Stone He Ever Threw""",1122508800,"07 28, 2005",2005,2272,"['When', 'think', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'think', 'smiling', 'Henry', 'Goodfellas', 'think', 'guy', 'life', 'full', 'youth', 'matter', 'how', 'old', 'Blow', 'Liotta', 'father', 'kid', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'George', 'husband', 'nagging', 'wife', 'Liotta', 'played', 'character', 'lot', 'conviction', 'was', 'sad', 'see', 'old', 'man', 'listening', 'tape', 'recorded', 'son', 'was', 'also', 'sad', 'see', 'play', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'son', 'strongest', 'man', 'earth', 'character', 'was', 'extremely', 'well', 'painted', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'have', 'possibly', 'done', 'more', 'justice', 'him.When', 'would', 'think', 'Depp', 'would', 'think', 'Edwards', 'Scissorhands.He', 'George', 'movie', 'almost', 'scene', 'Blow', 'revolves', 'must', 'say', 'liked', 'introduction', 'film.This', 'movie', 'kid', 'who', 'up', 'watching', 'mom', 'leave', 'dad', 'now', 'then', 'would', 'quarell', 'money', 'matters', 'wished', 'time', 'never', 'was', 'also', 'never', 'be', 'poor', 'matter', 'what', 'may', 'come', 'way.I', 'never', 'thought', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'was', 'almost', 'love', 'could', 'play', 'role', 'whiny', 'wife', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'Blow', 'was', 'good', 'managed', 'make', 'grind', 'teeth', 'time', 'spoke', 'harshly', 'George', 'Jung', 'prison', 'also', 'liked', 'fiance', 'stealing', 'scenes.Some', 'high', 'points', 'movie', 'came', 'end', 'Most', 'films', 'conclude', 'endnig', 'dire', 'sorts', 'Blow', 'tragic', 'yet', 'believable', 'ending', 'Depp', 'became', 'what', 'quite', 'amusing', 'see', 'realise', 'same', 'time', 'lived', 'life', 'man', 'who', 'ambitions', 'exceed', 'talent', 'Yes', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'Cocaine', 'wrong', 'steps', 'man', 'life.Another', 'heartbreaking', 'scene', 'was', 'Depp', 'acknowledging', 'fact', 'dad', 'Liotta', 'was', 'always', 'right', 'age', '42', 'Money', 'nothing.Pardon', 'random', 'not', 'easy', 'writing', 'review', 'Blow', 'made', 'smile', 'made', 'sad', 'whole', 'was', 'bit', 'lesson', 'own', 'way', 'Blow', 'had', 'good', 'ending', 'appropriate', 'would', 'recommend', 'Blow', 'everyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'over', 'mushy', 'endings', 'whom', 'reality', 'matters.Excellent', 'direction', 'good', 'screenplay.Enjoy', 'reader.PS', 'Wonder', 'what', 'doing', 'blow', 'actually', 'P']",N/A

538820,ABFJYHVD8RHLE,B00003CXWU,Hillary,"[6, 12]","I have to admit, I did find this film very entertaining. It does steal it's cinematography, direction, and soundtrack style from 1990s Martin Scorsese classic ""Goodfellas"" in a very obvious rip-off though. Let's face it, that's part of what makes it entertaining. What a compliment, over a decade and someone is still trying to capture that magic.There IS some magic herein. The film moves along interestingly, doesn't really have any dull moments, and is easy to follow.  This is a very watchable cast as well.  I personally found this film far more interesting than ""Traffic"", which felt slow, and too convoluted.  I will say that Johnny Depp was somewhat annoying to me in his role as main character George Jung. He wasn't a sympathetic character, he just seemed like a moron who managed to accrue a ton of money illegally, only to ""Blow"" it.  I didn't care about him or anyone else in the film, due to the one big fault here, poor character development.  Everyone in the movie seems empty, with the exception of Ray Liotta, who did a fine job as George's dad. I disliked Depp's bogus New England accent, it was annoying to listen to his narrations of the events.  This only thing worse?  His moms annoying nasal whine.  I lived in New England at one time, nobody sounded like this!  I also can't fathom why George evolves into such a doofy goofball toward the end, after having been a fairly cool guy at the beginning.The plot develops heat in the form of beautiful Mirtha (Penelope Cruz). She is a hedonistic, self indulgent Columbian coke family princess.  There is some steamy sexual chemistry as the two meet at a wedding of Georges closest  Columbian associate.  George steals Mirtha from a rival who can't fight his good standing with Pablo Escobar, famed (or so they say) lord of the (drug)rings. The two words ""I Do"" turn George into more than just a ""gringo"" to the cartel.  He becomes part of the family too.  Of course, that's not ALL he becomes as a result of this union.  Watch and see for yourself.Something I found funny, is the not so coincidental casting of Ray Liotta as Georges n'er do well Dad, and the goomah(girlfriend) he kept on the side in ""Goodfellas"", playing Georges Dad and Mom respectively.For the most part, watching the rise and fall of Jung from the 60s as a drug dealer who starts with marijuana, then pushes the envelope to a 70s Cocaine empire, is fun. You get an excellent feel of those eras in time, the clothes, hair, music ect. Again though, a similar agenda to ""Goodfellas."" The only difference?  One was the rise and fall of a ""mobster"" the other a ""drug dealer"" but still, chronicled in similar fashion during the same eras. However, since Henry Hill and associates did traffic and sell cocaine in a major amounts, the only difference is with ""Blow"" is, that's the ONLY basis of the story.That said, although one dimensional in its plot, not delving too deeply into who anyone actually is, or really getting any feeling for the characters beneath the facade, surface fluff this colorful, is STILL fun and entertaining.

His initial success he analyzes as his own and does not see it is the success of a system and when he fails it's because he crossed a line somewhere: too much and too sure of himself maybe even arrogant and condescending. Then his story is a story of successive failures in between short periods of success and long periods of prison as a result of it all. He ends up betrayed by his own partners who deliver him to the FBI and DEA one night in order to get themselves out of the business clean and unharmed. Finks, that's what his friends were. But he deserved it. Then the story seems to support him on the other side of the coin: his daughter. He loses his wife and his daughter in order to go and by going to prison a first time. Then he re-conquers his daughter little by little and he promises to take her away from the squalor her mother is providing. But that's when he decides to do one more trick to get the money he needs to kidnap his own daughter. That's when he is picked up, lower than him you cannot fall, by the police and sent to prison for so long that he will never see his father alive again. So he dreams his daughter comes and visits him. But that's a dream, an illusion, a mirage. He was not able to deliver his promise and he has been discarded like an old shoe or a worn out sock. Sad but after all very moralistic. Crime does not pay and only brings deception, disappointment and suffering. Too moral maybe to be as good as it could have been.

It shows the story of George Jung, which has not really been touched on before in the media or in movies, and while some might think the story isn't interesting, I found it fascinating, sometimes quite sympathetic, and cool.Johnny Depp gives possibly his best performance to date as the drug dealer, who started out as a pot dealer in California (then sending the weed to Boston and gaining a fortune).  Then after prison time, gets a newfound drug dealing venture- cocaine, which he supplies to America via Pablo Escobar and in the process of making 85% of cocaine users in the 70's and 80's, also became a millionaire.  But like a certain other film (best film ever) GoodFellas, this film gets the sad juices and flowing and even though some might think it shouldn't be used on a man such as Jung, it didn't matter to me.I saw it as a really good look at the guy who tries to find redemtpion and in the process looses everything, but find out who he is and should be some day.  Brilliance achieved in great craft-like filmmaking, fine acting and a good script, plus a mindblowing soundtrack.  Exceptional cast includes Depp, Potente as Jung's first love, Cruz as his second and unfortunate love, Pee Wee Paul Reubens in his best role in 16 years as a coke and pot dealer and Ray Liotta in a swuitcheroo role from GoodFellas as Jung's father.",5,One of the best films of the year- a knockout,989884800,"05 15, 2001",2001,1437,"['Blow', 'movie', 'up', 'there', 'best', 'best', 'drug', 'movies', 'rightfully', 'so', 'story', 'George', 'Jung', 'not', 'really', 'been', 'touched', 'media', 'movies', 'might', 'think', 'story', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'found', 'fascinating', 'sometimes', 'quite', 'sympathetic', 'cool.Johnny', 'Depp', 'possibly', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'started', 'out', 'pot', 'dealer', 'California', 'then', 'sending', 'weed', 'Boston', 'gaining', 'fortune', 'Then', 'prison', 'time', 'newfound', 'drug', 'dealing', 'venture-', 'cocaine', 'America', 'Pablo', 'Escobar', 'process', 'making', '85', '%', 'cocaine', 'users', '70', '80', 'also', 'became', 'millionaire', 'certain', 'other', 'film', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'GoodFellas', 'film', 'sad', 'juices', 'flowing', 'even', 'might', 'think', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'used', 'man', 'such', 'Jung', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'me.I', 'saw', 'really', 'good', 'look', 'guy', 'who', 'find', 'redemtpion', 'process', 'everything', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'day', 'Brilliance', 'achieved', 'great', 'craft-like', 'filmmaking', 'fine', 'acting', 'good', 'script', 'mindblowing', 'soundtrack', 'Exceptional', 'cast', 'Depp', 'Potente', 'Jung', 'first', 'love', 'Cruz', 'second', 'unfortunate', 'love', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'Paul', 'Reubens', 'best', 'role', '16', 'years', 'coke', 'pot', 'dealer', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'swuitcheroo', 'role', 'GoodFellas', 'Jung', 'father']",N/A

Tilley Jr. ""goatman_1""","[0, 0]","OK, so Blow doesn't support a huge all star cast, or an ambitious multi-angled plot, but to be quite frank, I thought most of Traffic was a load of pretentious, preachy Hollywood smarm. With the exception of Benicio Del Toro scenes (which were fantastic and well deserving of an Oscar), the movie had all the personality and believability of &quot;As the World Turns.&quot;Blow is much less ambitious in it's scope and cast, but what it lacks in sophistication, it more than makes up for in it's charm and honesty. That's not to say that facts weren't changed for whatever reason, but the protagonist isn't made out to be some herculean character. He's just a normal, likeable guy who made lots of tragic mistakes in life that lead to a path of self destruction. The movie doesn't preach or try to be all things to all people. It is what it is, and the people act like, well... people. What they do they do for their own reasons, not to further the plot. That's what makes the movie great, it's about people being people and all the stupid, unpredictable things they do.Oh, it's also about drugs, how could we forget. But the whole drug aspect seems very secondary to the human aspect. There are no grandiose speeches abut the War of Drugs and how we should spend more money on treatment than prevention or anything even close to that, but it also doesn't portray drugs in a glamorous or friendly way. Drugs can never be human, and this movie portrays them as neither evil, misguided or liberating. They are what they are: just another inanimate substance with a disproportionate social significance.Kudos as usual to Johnny Depp. After seeing the interviews with Jung in prison, it was almost creepy to see Depp mimic him. Depp does his best work when portraying real people like Hunter S. Thompson, Donnie Brasco, Ed Wood and the like. Depp goes so far as to adopt every subtle little nuance of a person making his performance completely believable. It was impossible for me not to sympathise with Jung, regardless of his selfish behavior.The DVD boasts some great special features that I have only begun to explore.

538832,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00003CXWU,J from NY,"[5, 6]","""Blow"" is the kind of movie about drugs I can respect in one sense: it neither glorifies it nor condemns it, does not for one second pull a DARE moment on us, and yet allows us to see the essentially destructive nature of the indisputable scumbag George Jung's lifestyle.Johnny Depp did a great job portraying Jung, and I'm sure if Jung had somehow slipped out of his cell and played himself the movie would have gone nowhere--keep in mind while watching Jung go from being a twenty year old with money on the brain to middle aged wreck, to the ultimate b**ch, that this is JOHNNY DEPP, not George Jung.  I'm sure it was quite a bit less glamorous and charming in actuality.Jung was moving weight.  Serious weight.  Weight enough to get him screwed over by his equally strung out friends and land in jail till 2014.  He had his good times, but they were all predicated on fear and paranoia: you can practically sense the impending doom from every wonderfully hedonistic moment in this film.Ray Liotta, as Jung's father is touching.  His subtlety and seemingly endless empathy for Jung's skewed plight in life strikes a moving contrast to his mother, who after awhile simply wants nothing to do with Jung.  He sticks (in a sense) with Depp's Jung right till the very end.  The last few scenes are chilling and disturbing:Jung is betrayed by his friends in a cinematic moment few will forget.My only problem with this movie is that it generates actually sympathy for George Jung as a man (the last picture of him flashed as Depp is hallucinating that his daughter is speaking with him is grotesque and shows the very real nature of the toll the use and decades of hustling took on him) and one wonders if this is appropriate at all.  I tend to doubt that Jung cared that much about his daughter.  If he did, maybe he wouldn't have wasted the best years of his life slinging coke.  Plus, no major drugdealer would ever behave like this.  During the course of the movie he is screwed over a billion times by just about everyone and seems pretty friendly about it afterwards.  If Jung in fact conducted his ""business"" this way,he was either really looped out on his own product or simply a stupid kid who was in the right time at the right place to sell tons of cocaine and had no basic idea of what he was doing.This movie is a work of art, though, for all the moral ambiguity involved.

This movie stars the versatile Johnny Depp, who, in my opinion, is the best actor of our time.  The guy can do anything.  It also stars the stunning Penelope Cruz, Paul Reubens, and Ray Liotta, another versatile actor.The movie is based on a true story and is about the rise and fall of cocaine dealer George Jung (Johnny Depp).  He at one time was the biggest importer of Colombian cocaine to the U.S.  His partner in crime was the extremely dangerous Pablo Escobar, the famous Colombian drug lord.  In order to achieve his remarkable feats of importing cocaine undetected, Jung had to have great courage, confidence, and determination, which he did.  He seemed to have TOO much confidence.  He paid the price when he got caught.  He gets out of prison and just repeats the very things that landed him in prison to begin with.  The guy's a total loser, one of those repeat offenders that doesn't learn his lessons.  His cocaine dealing dramatically affected the U.S. in that the supply of cocaine on the streets of the U.S. skyrocketed during the 1970s and 1980s.Ray Liotta (Unlawful Entry, Field Of Dreams, Article 99) plays Jung's father.  Penelope Cruz (Vanilla Sky, Nine) plays Jung's wife.  Watching this movie will bring you back to the '70s and '80s.  The clothing, cars, and overall society as it was back then are portrayed accurately.  You'll also hear some rock songs from that era.The acting is very good, especially by Depp and Cruz.This DVD contains excellent special features, some of which are:Beyond the Movie features:George Jung interviews by director Ted DemmeLost Paradise: Cocaine's Impact on ColombiaAddiction: Body and SoulFact Track - Trivia Subtitle Track with direct access to additional featuresDVD-ROM features:Script-to-Screen access to the movieLink to the original websiteExclusive access to online infinifilm featuresAll-Access Pass features:Commentary with director Ted Demme and George JungDeleted scenes with director commentaryCharacter outtakesTed Demme's production diaryNikka Costa music video - ""Push and Pull""Teaser and theatrical trailerCast and crew filmographiesAll in all, this is an interesting movie that I recommmend for a refreshing change of pace.",4,The dangerous world of blow,1282867200,"08 27, 2010",2010,2264,"['saw', 'Blow', '2001', 'theater', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'liked', 'movie', 'versatile', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'who', 'opinion', 'best', 'actor', 'time', 'guy', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'also', 'stunning', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Paul', 'Reubens', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'versatile', 'actor.The', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'rise', 'fall', 'cocaine', 'dealer', 'George', 'Jung', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'biggest', 'importer', 'Colombian', 'cocaine', 'U.S.', 'partner', 'crime', 'was', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'Pablo', 'Escobar', 'famous', 'Colombian', 'drug', 'lord', 'order', 'achieve', 'remarkable', 'feats', 'importing', 'cocaine', 'undetected', 'Jung', 'had', 'have', 'great', 'courage', 'confidence', 'determination', 'did', 'seemed', 'have', 'TOO', 'much', 'confidence', 'paid', 'price', 'when', 'got', 'caught', 'prison', 'just', 'repeats', 'very', 'things', 'landed', 'prison', 'begin', 'guy', 'total', 'loser', 'one', 'repeat', 'offenders', ""n't"", 'learn', 'lessons', 'cocaine', 'dealing', 'dramatically', 'affected', 'U.S.', 'supply', 'cocaine', 'streets', 'U.S.', 'skyrocketed', '1970s', '1980s.Ray', 'Liotta', 'Unlawful', 'Entry', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'Article', '99', 'Jung', 'father', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'Nine', 'Jung', 'wife', 'Watching', 'movie', 'will', 'bring', 'back', ""'70s"", ""'80s"", 'clothing', 'cars', 'overall', 'society', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'are', 'portrayed', 'accurately', ""'ll"", 'also', 'hear', 'rock', 'songs', 'era.The', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'Depp', 'Cruz.This', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'Movie', 'features', 'George', 'Jung', 'interviews', 'director', 'Ted', 'DemmeLost', 'Paradise', 'Cocaine', 'Impact', 'ColombiaAddiction', 'Body', 'SoulFact', 'Track', 'Trivia', 'Subtitle', 'Track', 'direct', 'access', 'additional', 'featuresDVD-ROM', 'features', 'Script-to-Screen', 'access', 'movieLink', 'original', 'websiteExclusive', 'access', 'online', 'infinifilm', 'featuresAll-Access', 'Pass', 'features', 'Commentary', 'director', 'Ted', 'Demme', 'George', 'JungDeleted', 'scenes', 'director', 'commentaryCharacter', 'outtakesTed', 'Demme', 'production', 'diaryNikka', 'Costa', 'music', 'video', 'Push', 'Pull', 'Teaser', 'theatrical', 'trailerCast', 'crew', 'filmographiesAll', 'interesting', 'movie', 'recommmend', 'refreshing', 'change', 'pace']",N/A

We watch Jung grow up in a stressful household with a shrewish mother (Rachel Griffiths) and an easygoing father (Ray Liotta); Ms. Griffiths' characterization as Ermine Jung is so reminiscent of Lorraine Bracco as Karen Hill in GOODFELLAS that I initially confused the two actresses. Liotta of course, played Henry Hill.George flees his childhood home for the endless sunshine of Southern California circa 1967, where, dedicated to the proposition that he will never be poor, he begins to deal drugs. A minor pot bust leads to an association with Pablo Escobar's Medellin Cartel, and George soon builds his small-scale operation into the major North American llello pipeline.His vast wealth (literally hundreds of millions of dollars over the years) leads to the predictable vast excesses (think Tony Montana in SCARFACE) and George's hedonistic lifestyle comes crashing down in a white cloud of confusion, betrayal and self-destruction. Depp captures it all perfectly, without caricaturing any of it, an impressive accomplishment when one considers how easily the Cocaine Universe lent itself to cartoonishness in the mid-Eighties. George Jung ultimately was convicted of smuggling and was sentenced to a horrifying sixty years.Despite George's Colombian connections, he remained a small-town American boy at heart, and Depp deftly and subtlely demonstrates to us George's increasing sense of isolation and disorientation in the midst of the drug culture. In the end, George Jung is left nothing but his sense of aching emptiness as he pines for his daughter Kristina, who, the film tells us as it ends, has never visited her father.George Jung is seen in the Special Features as a broken, sad and lonely man, condemned to spending most of the rest of his life behind bars.

My teenage son, however, rented the DVD, and I found myself a captive audience. To my surprise, it was a riveting, well done film. Sure, it was about a two bit dope dealer, but what a story. George Jung, an all American kid from a hard working, hard knocks family, begins dealing marijuana during the 1960s. He develops his business into an empire, and then he decides to branch out into the sexier world of cocaine and really big money. Using his considerable entrepreneurial instinct, he makes a deal with the Columbian drug cartel. Before you know it, he is raking in millions. Unfortunately, the best laid plans often go awry, and there is no fairy tale ending for George. This is a story of hopes, dreams, violence, greed, and betrayal.Well directed by the late Ted Demme, the film is compelling and absorbing as it recounts George Jung's incredible odyssey in the drug trade, tracking the rise of the cocaine industry in the United States, attendant with all its violence. Johnny Depp, in the role of George Jung, makes him into a likable guy who has bitten off more than he can chew, with ultimately dire results. His is a search for the American Dream, a dream that forever remains elusive.Ray Liotta is terrific in the role of George's father, Fred Jung, a sensitive and devoted everyman married to a hard, selfish woman, Ermine Jung, a woman who lacks all motherly instincts and is played with gritty determination by Rachel Griffiths. Jordi Molla is excellent in the role of Diego, George's entre into the world of high stakes, cocaine dealing, and Cliff Curtis is excellent as Escobar, the Columbian drug cartel's main man. Penelope Cruz is terrible as George's beautiful Latina wife, Mirtha. She is simply a bad actress whose English is often unintelligible. With the exception of Ms. Cruz, however, the cast is uniformly excellent.This is the story about a young man who, faced with choices in his life, made the wrong ones and lived to regret it. Johnny Depp captures the pathos of Jung's wasted life. That his characterization is dead on is brought home by Ted Demme's wonderful interview of the real George Jung. This interview is one of the numerous bonus features on this DVD and is well worth watching. It is a poignant interview, as it underscores that Jung's was a life wasted. It also serves to illustrate just how remarkable Depp's characterization of Jung really is.

I have a hard time understanding what's being said unless I can also read someone's lips.  On a 14"" TV, that's not always possible.  Thus, I appreciate closed captioning. I am sure deaf people do too.  This is the first DVD I've seen in a long time that does not include it in the standard features, or if it does, I sure as hell couldn't find it.Second, the movie itself:  at a certain point I lost all sympathy for George Jung.  You can root for a small-time pot dealer who is in cahoots with a stewardess to smuggle marijuana cross-country.  Even as his greed gets the best of him, nobody's getting killed, nobody's dying of overdoses.  But it's hard to have much sympathy for a character who works for a drug lord who shot a man in cold blood at the ""job interview.""Jung knew firsthand the damage cocaine was doing to his friends' and wife's health.  He saw with his own eyes the damage it was doing to innocent people in Columbia.  He wasn't just an addict without the willpower to stop himself from doing another line.  He was running the largest drug-smuggling ring in the country.Boo hoo.  He lost his daughter's trust when he didn't show up to take her to California.  That trip wasn't meant to make Kristina Jung happy, it was to prove to himself that he was at heart a good dad.This is one of those movies that irritates me precisely because it could have been excellent.  I don't mean that it should have become an anti-drug screed (few things are more tiresome than those), but it could have been vastly improved by the director and screenwriter having more emotional distance from Jung.  The problem is not that Jung believes the things he tells himself about himself, it is that Ted Demme does too.Also, I have yet to see a movie with Penelope Cruz in it in which she does not completely annoy me.",2,"mildly entertaining, but then just plain irritating",1181520000,"06 11, 2007",2007,1953,"['bought', 'other', 'day', 'whim', 'garage', 'sale.First', 'off', 'technical', 'matter', 'where', 'hell', 'closed', 'captioning', 'DVD', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'understanding', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'can', 'also', 'read', 'someone', 'lips', '14', 'TV', 'not', 'always', 'possible', 'Thus', 'appreciate', 'closed', 'captioning', 'am', 'sure', 'deaf', 'people', 'do', 'too', 'first', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'not', 'include', 'standard', 'sure', 'hell', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'it.Second', 'movie', 'certain', 'point', 'lost', 'sympathy', 'George', 'Jung', 'can', 'root', 'small-time', 'pot', 'dealer', 'who', 'cahoots', 'stewardess', 'smuggle', 'marijuana', 'cross-country', 'Even', 'greed', 'best', 'nobody', 'getting', 'killed', 'nobody', 'dying', 'overdoses', 'hard', 'have', 'much', 'sympathy', 'character', 'who', 'drug', 'lord', 'who', 'shot', 'man', 'cold', 'blood', 'job', 'interview', 'Jung', 'knew', 'firsthand', 'damage', 'cocaine', 'was', 'doing', 'friends', 'wife', 'health', 'saw', 'own', 'eyes', 'damage', 'was', 'doing', 'innocent', 'people', 'Columbia', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'addict', 'willpower', 'stop', 'doing', 'line', 'was', 'running', 'largest', 'drug-smuggling', 'ring', 'country.Boo', 'hoo', 'lost', 'daughter', 'trust', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'take', 'California', 'trip', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'make', 'Kristina', 'Jung', 'happy', 'was', 'prove', 'was', 'heart', 'good', 'dad.This', 'one', 'movies', 'precisely', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'should', 'have', 'become', 'anti-drug', 'screed', 'few', 'things', 'are', 'more', 'tiresome', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'vastly', 'improved', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'having', 'more', 'emotional', 'distance', 'Jung', 'problem', 'not', 'Jung', 'things', 'Ted', 'Demme', 'too.Also', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'movie', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'not', 'completely']",N/A

As a young man, George goes to California and teams up with a flamboyant gay hairdresser, played by Paul Reubens, to sell marijuana. After a short prison sentence where he meets Jordi Molla, a Colombian drug dealer, he graduates to cocaine. All this is done with relative ease against a background of the exaggerated hairstyles and clothing that seem like artificial props. His first girlfriend, Franka Potente is a stewardess who helps him get started by smuggling marijuana in her travel bag; his second girlfriend, Penelope Cruz is enamoured by his money. All of this casting is excellent and the craziness that was the 70s comes through loud and clear.I liked the cinematography. The period of the 1950s was shot in an over-exposed brightness. And there were quick snapshot montages which were well done. The action moved quickly and I was intrigued throughout although the presence of Ray Liotta, cast as George's father, kept reminding me of &quot;Goodfellas&quot; which was a much better film. It is hard to relate to the Johnny Depp character however. His life was a tragedy but yet he seemed shallow. Perhaps this is by design because the writers did not want to glorify a drug dealer. It did glorify the money though, and the high-living lifestyle that it brought even though it blew away just like everything else. Even though I wasn't deeply moved, I do recommend this film.

I really loved 13 Days (see a prior review), and if there is one thing worthy of notice in &quot;Blow&quot;, it is the presentation, technical style and DVD extras.  No attempt is made in the actual film to explore the horrors of cocaine, but the twodocumentaries make it clear how the 70's drug of choice has devastated the culture and society of Colombia, along with the lives of many.  Ted Demme, a fine director, explores what scenes were left on the cutting room floor in an entertaining piece, and the real George Jung gives a film interview that makes the &quot;goings on&quot; in Blow seem a little closer to reality.That said, the film was a disappointment to me - well filmed, with no seeming point or passion.  I felt that Johnny Depp wasbelievable and totally in character for the role, and perhaps heand Demme meant to have him exhibit little or no passion or chemistry with the central women in his life, his mother, his wife, his daughter.  He's believable in the youth scenes and the drug trafficking scenes, in prison....but seeing him try to make us believe that his daughter is the central focus of his life...well, it just didn't feel that way on the screen.Ray Liotta is miscast and subdued as Jungs' dad, and, with every passing flick I grow more and more disenchanted with Penelope Cruz, who just seems to show up on the screen, emote a little, and hurry to get back to her film trailer.  Capt. Corelli was disastrous, she is strident and unattractive in Blow, and, intuition tells me that Vanilla Sky will fall on its face.So, you take a bit of pop culture, add an incredibly talented leading man and director with little support from the other cast, and perhaps not enough of a tale to tell, and you get &quot;Blow&quot;.Not a favorite of mine.",3,Technically excellent...,1007596800,"12 6, 2001",2001,1843,"[""'m"", 'impressed', 'Infinifilm', 'presentation', 'style', 'DVD', 'efforts', 'really', 'loved', '13', 'Days', 'see', 'prior', 'review', 'one', 'thing', 'worthy', 'notice', 'quot', 'Blow', 'quot', 'presentation', 'technical', 'style', 'DVD', 'extras', 'attempt', 'made', 'actual', 'film', 'explore', 'horrors', 'cocaine', 'twodocumentaries', 'make', 'clear', 'how', '70', 'drug', 'choice', 'devastated', 'culture', 'society', 'Colombia', 'lives', 'many', 'Ted', 'Demme', 'fine', 'director', 'what', 'scenes', 'were', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'entertaining', 'piece', 'real', 'George', 'Jung', 'film', 'interview', 'quot', 'goings', 'quot', 'Blow', 'seem', 'little', 'closer', 'reality.That', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'disappointment', 'well', 'filmed', 'seeming', 'point', 'passion', 'felt', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'wasbelievable', 'totally', 'character', 'role', 'perhaps', 'heand', 'Demme', 'meant', 'have', 'exhibit', 'little', 'passion', 'chemistry', 'central', 'women', 'life', 'mother', 'wife', 'daughter', 'believable', 'youth', 'scenes', 'drug', 'trafficking', 'scenes', 'prison', 'seeing', 'try', 'make', 'believe', 'daughter', 'central', 'focus', 'life', 'well', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'way', 'screen.Ray', 'Liotta', 'miscast', 'subdued', 'Jungs', 'dad', 'passing', 'flick', 'grow', 'more', 'more', 'disenchanted', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'who', 'just', 'show', 'up', 'screen', 'emote', 'little', 'hurry', 'get', 'back', 'film', 'trailer', 'Capt', 'Corelli', 'was', 'disastrous', 'strident', 'unattractive', 'Blow', 'intuition', 'tells', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'will', 'fall', 'face.So', 'take', 'bit', 'pop', 'culture', 'add', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'leading', 'man', 'director', 'little', 'support', 'other', 'cast', 'perhaps', 'not', 'enough', 'tale', 'tell', 'get', 'quot', 'Blow', 'quot', 'favorite', 'mine']",N/A

538862,AGQY11NLQJ2JL,B00003CXWU,Medusa,"[0, 0]","The movie Blow is based on the story of George Jung, who played a major role in the United States cocaine trade.  Certainly, the movie authentically represents the cocaine trade, and the people that Jung dealt with, but it was not as loyal to the portrayal of Jung's emotional side (i.e. his obsession with women and sex, his strange habits, and his total pleasure seeking life style). Instead, Johnny Depp portrayed the role of a good hearted man with good values who got into the business as a result of being mistreated by life events. I couldn't help but bonding with, and relating to this supposedly bad character.Regardless of how faithful the movie depicted real life characters, I know that the moral lesson of crime and punishment was delivered through a wonderful touching acting of the entire cast.Johnny Depp and Ray Loitta delivered an amazing performance. The scene of the old father listening to a tape of his son's voice is one of the most powerful scenes I've ever seen. The love Jung has for his daughter and his suffering because of his absence from her life was very credibly delivered by Depp and little Emma RobertsThe final scene with Depp's introspection is very touching; I still remember his voice saying:""Through out my life, I gave pieces of my heart to people I loved, that I don't have enough of my heart to keep me living"".I watched this movie at least 10 times since 2001 and I know it will remain one of my heart's dearest movies. Today, I made the surprising discovery on Wikipedia that Kristina Sunshine actually visited her father in jail after watching this movie.

Depp's style of acting is really anti-acting in that he literally becomes the part he is playing much like Marlon Brando, James Dean and Paul Newman who came out of the New York's Actors Studio. His style of acting is very natural, though with little of the seams and krinkles we see in Brando or Dean's performances. Depp also makes daring choices: how different can his chracter in &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; be from his character in &quot;Chocolat&quot; or here in &quot;Blow?&quot; Depp is the best thing about &quot;Blow&quot; despite director Ted Demme's dreary, lackluster pacing. Penelope Cruz who plays Mirtha, Jung's wife, heretofore has been a whirlwind of talent and sexiness, but in &quot;Blow&quot; she is merely drugged out,petulant and mostly boring. Check her out in &quot;Woman on Top&quot; or &quot;Some things about my Mother&quot; to witness Cruz at her best: earthy, smart and sensual like a young Sophia Loren. Franka Potente as Barbara comes off best after Depp proving that she can also play a kind, warm-hearted chracter very much in love with George. &quot;Blow&quot; only succeeds because of Depp and Potente and to a smaller degree Paul Reubens as Derek.

A true bloody tale would have been more accurate and entertaining but director instead tells us a version of drug dealing that is like a fairy tale in some ways.  That's nothing new for hollywood.Many biographies are so whitewashed that the real person would be amazed that this person on screen is supposed to be him!.  The reality though is that coke and it's children have laid waste to millions of lives and to make a movie that doesn't show this destruction is rather strange.

Because they dont want to make it sound like George Blung was some kind of a hero. But it deserved at least 3 stars, because of the excellent acting, and cast, and the way the biopic was written captured the sadness of the true story, and focused on what drugs do to a person's life, and how drug dealig is a path you never want to go down. I think that this guy wasn't a bad guy, and the only reason he got a harsh sentence in the end is because of the 3 strikes you're out. After being in and out of jail he continued to pursue his drug dealing ""career"" because in a way it's as addicting as drugs can be. And that's all he knew. After stopping the ""business"" he only went back to get money for his daughter, so he can see her and take her to california because that was the agreement he made with mirtha his ex wife. So the ending to me was very sad. And i dont understand why he said at the end that he would do it all over again if he had a second chance, that did defeat alot of things that the movie had suceededly made clear about that kind of life will never end with anything good. It's like stealing, it gets addicting after the first time you get away with it. Getting caught, the possibility, gives you a rush of adrealine. Like drug dealing, getting all that money. I mean come on george had 60 million bucks, and he still kept at it, and didnt want his partner to have his california connection source. It's the addiction of the drug dealing. It had to take him getting beat up and betrayed by his partner, to realize he should stop, and then he went broke, and wanted to do one final retirement score, and that happened to be THE bust, and sting set up by the fbi. But anyways, i think depp was fantastic in this film, and it's very entertaining i especially liked the cuban guy, who was depp's drug dealing partner.

538882,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CXWU,Reviewer,"[3, 3]","The effects of lacking the fortitude and conscience to make the right choices in life are examined in ""Blow,"" directed by Ted Demme and starring Johnny Depp as George Jung, a young New Englander who decides early on that living week to week and barely being able to make ends meet is not the kind of life he wants.  George grew up in the `50s, in a decent, middle-class family, but was deeply affected by the fact that his father, Fred (Ray Liotta), worked his fingers to the bone as a plumber, sometimes fourteen hours a day, seven days a week, and it was never enough, especially for his mother, Ermine (Rachel Griffiths), who complained endlessly about not having enough money.  More than once she abandoned her family, only to be taken back every time upon her return by Fred, who adored her.  Then, in the late `60s, George, along with his childhood friend, Tuna (Ethan Suplee), moved to Southern California and quickly discovered the freedom of the beaches and a lifestyle conducive to his idea of paradise.  That ""paradise"" being anchored in the realization of the big, easy money to be made at the time selling marijuana; and for George, it was only the beginning, the on-ramp to the freeway that would ultimately take him to the top of his ""profession,"" and which was destined to define his life.It's a tale as old as time, the lesson of which is destined forever-- unfortunately-- to be ignored by those who seek the quick and easy road to wealth and happiness.  Courage, it has been said, has many faces; one kind earns soldiers and citizens medals for rising above imminent danger.  Another can be defined as being able to decline the carrot of ill-gotten gains when it is dangled before you.  George lacked that kind of courage, and instead grabbed the promise it proffered with both hands, only to discover-- too late-- that it was empty indeed, and laced with unhappiness.  It's a classic rags-to-riches-to-oblivion story, with a moral that will be embraced by those with the wisdom to build their house of brick instead of sticks and straw.As George, Depp turns in a convincing, believable performance, portraying him as a misguided, rather than ""bad"" person.  You sense that George's naivete enabled him to take chances and enter an arena to which common sense would otherwise have dictated avoidance, and because of that you are able to sympathize somewhat with him.  Depp lends an innocence to the character in which you can find the kid next door, the good kid you grew up with and knew throughout your school years, and in retrospect, it would seem that George, a reasonably intelligent young man, simply made some very stupid decisions.  And, as they say, the prisons are full of those just like him.  But the most telling indication of who George really is and what he could/should have been, comes through his relationship with his father.  And it is that which becomes the very core of the story.As Fred Jung, Ray Liotta gives a poignant performance, presenting a very real person in a very real setting.  completely avoiding any kind of stereotype into which this character could easily have fallen, Liotta plays him with a depth that averts  sentimentality and makes the unconditional love he shows for his son entirely believable.  It's a direct and understated performance that so clearly defines the true character of the man, and it is in the scenes between Liotta and Depp that the true nature of George is revealed as well, in which you begin to understand that he was just an ordinary guy who got caught up in extraordinary circumstances of his own design.The supporting cast includes Penelope Cruz (Mirtha), Franka Potente (Barbara), Paul Reubens (Derek Foreal), Jordi Molla (Diego), Cliff Curtis (Escobar) and Max Perlich (Dulli).  A cautionary tale for those who allow themselves to stray from the straight and narrow, the real impact of ""Blow"" is ultimately contained in the final frame of the film.  It is a still picture of the real George Jung; and to fully realize what his life has been about, you need look no further than into the eyes of the man in that photograph.",4,Solid Drama,987292800,"04 15, 2001",2001,4111,"['effects', 'lacking', 'fortitude', 'conscience', 'make', 'right', 'choices', 'life', 'are', 'examined', 'Blow', 'directed', 'Ted', 'Demme', 'starring', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'George', 'Jung', 'young', 'New', 'Englander', 'who', 'early', 'living', 'week', 'week', 'barely', 'being', 'able', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'not', 'kind', 'life', 'George', 'grew', 'up', '50s', 'decent', 'middle-class', 'family', 'was', 'deeply', 'affected', 'fact', 'father', 'Fred', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'worked', 'fingers', 'bone', 'plumber', 'sometimes', 'fourteen', 'hours', 'day', 'seven', 'days', 'week', 'was', 'never', 'enough', 'especially', 'mother', 'Ermine', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'who', 'complained', 'endlessly', 'not', 'having', 'enough', 'money', 'More', 'once', 'abandoned', 'family', 'only', 'be', 'taken', 'back', 'time', 'return', 'Fred', 'who', 'adored', 'Then', 'late', '60s', 'George', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Tuna', 'Ethan', 'Suplee', 'moved', 'Southern', 'California', 'quickly', 'discovered', 'freedom', 'beaches', 'lifestyle', 'conducive', 'idea', 'paradise', 'paradise', 'being', 'anchored', 'realization', 'big', 'easy', 'money', 'be', 'made', 'time', 'selling', 'marijuana', 'George', 'was', 'only', 'beginning', 'on-ramp', 'freeway', 'would', 'ultimately', 'take', 'top', 'profession', 'was', 'destined', 'define', 'life.It', 'tale', 'as', 'old', 'time', 'lesson', 'destined', 'forever', 'unfortunately', 'be', 'ignored', 'who', 'seek', 'quick', 'easy', 'road', 'wealth', 'happiness', 'Courage', 'been', 'said', 'many', 'one', 'kind', 'soldiers', 'citizens', 'medals', 'rising', 'imminent', 'danger', 'can', 'be', 'defined', 'being', 'able', 'decline', 'carrot', 'ill-gotten', 'gains', 'when', 'dangled', 'George', 'lacked', 'kind', 'courage', 'instead', 'grabbed', 'promise', 'proffered', 'hands', 'only', 'discover', 'too', 'late', 'was', 'empty', 'indeed', 'laced', 'unhappiness', 'classic', 'rags-to-riches-to-oblivion', 'story', 'moral', 'will', 'be', 'embraced', 'wisdom', 'build', 'house', 'brick', 'instead', 'sticks', 'straw.As', 'George', 'Depp', 'convincing', 'believable', 'performance', 'portraying', 'misguided', 'rather', 'bad', 'person', 'sense', 'George', 'naivete', 'enabled', 'take', 'chances', 'enter', 'arena', 'common', 'sense', 'would', 'otherwise', 'have', 'dictated', 'avoidance', 'are', 'able', 'sympathize', 'somewhat', 'Depp', 'innocence', 'character', 'can', 'find', 'kid', 'next', 'door', 'good', 'kid', 'grew', 'up', 'knew', 'school', 'years', 'retrospect', 'would', 'seem', 'George', 'reasonably', 'intelligent', 'young', 'man', 'simply', 'made', 'very', 'stupid', 'decisions', 'say', 'prisons', 'are', 'full', 'just', 'most', 'telling', 'indication', 'who', 'George', 'really', 'what', 'could/should', 'have', 'been', 'relationship', 'father', 'very', 'core', 'story.As', 'Fred', 'Jung', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'poignant', 'performance', 'presenting', 'very', 'real', 'person', 'very', 'real', 'setting', 'completely', 'avoiding', 'kind', 'stereotype', 'character', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'fallen', 'Liotta', 'depth', 'sentimentality', 'unconditional', 'love', 'son', 'entirely', 'believable', 'direct', 'understated', 'performance', 'so', 'clearly', 'true', 'character', 'man', 'scenes', 'Liotta', 'Depp', 'true', 'nature', 'George', 'revealed', 'as', 'well', 'begin', 'understand', 'was', 'just', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'who', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 'own', 'design.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Mirtha', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'Barbara', 'Paul', 'Reubens', 'Derek', 'Foreal', 'Jordi', 'Molla', 'Diego', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'Escobar', 'Max', 'Perlich', 'Dulli', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'who', 'allow', 'stray', 'straight', 'narrow', 'real', 'impact', 'Blow', 'ultimately', 'contained', 'final', 'frame', 'film', 'still', 'picture', 'real', 'George', 'Jung', 'fully', 'realize', 'what', 'life', 'been', 'about', 'need', 'look', 'further', 'eyes', 'man', 'photograph']",N/A

Crawford,"[1, 1]","This starts off really well, with a guy who kind of stumbles into drug dealing and then applies his great natural talents to it with innovative audacity.  For the first half of the film, it portrays the whole hippy-to-coke era as a a kind of almost innocent frolic.  Then, once some real baddies emerge, it get really rough in the second half, leading to the downfall of a more or less good natured guy who wants to get out and raise his daughter, but cannot.  In other words, this is pretty cheaply romantic, almost making George into a feckless victim of the more ruthless players he is forced to deal with, to ever worsening betrayals.  That is what hollywood did to the story of a criminal who helped bring Escobar's cocaine into the US at horrendous cost to the society.That being said, the film is fun to watch.  You get a feel for the 60s-80s, music, fashion, and all.  For the first hour or so, the acting is also extremely good, particularly with Depp as the young George, and tightly edited.  Once the downward slide begins, however, the film's tone becomes rushed and sloppy.  That makes the second hour boring in addition to dreary and depressing.

538886,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXWU,Roland E. Zwick,"[8, 12]","Coming as it does so hot on the heels of the brilliant, multi-leveled ""Traffic,"" ""Blow"" emerges as a superficial, shallow and second-rate survey of the drug-dealing world.  Spanning close to five decades, the film chronicles the true-life account of one George Jung, a hotshot cocaine trafficker from the 1970's who is currently serving a 60-year prison sentence for his crimes.Very little about this film feels original or authentic, as it travels a dramatic arc that seems totally predictable for films of this genre (""Traffic,"" by the way, did NOT follow this path).  We start with George's unhappy home life growing up in Massachusetts in the 1960's, then it's onto his introduction to drug selling on the beaches of California, his trips to Colombia for meetings with the famous drug cartel leader, Pablo Escobar, his seemingly endless arrests, imprisonments and releases from prison and finally, of course, his too-late realization that the only thing of any value in his life is his little daughter whose life he is managing to screw up in a royal way.The early days of his ""career"" - when he is just a young punk making his connections and getting his feet wet in the ""glamorous"" world of the burgeoning late-60's drug culture - are dramatized on screen with tedious predictability.  Even the youthful looking Johnny Depp may be getting a bit long-in-the-tooth to be portraying a late teen, early twenty-something beach bum.  The film picks up a little dramatic energy when George is introduced to Escobar, but this aspect of the film is dropped almost immediately in order to concentrate on the tiresome interpersonal backstabbing between George and a number of his drug-running cronies.  I realize that this is supposed to be based on a true story, but it is still a shame when the movie ends up having to downplay and eventually even jettison the one subplot that carries with it at least some dramatic validity.  Equally uninteresting is George's relationship with his wife, Mirtha (Penelope Cruz), a stereotypical cocaine-snorting, Latina sexpot, more concerned with her drug supply than with her husband and daughter.  The filmmakers even try to draw some heavy-handed parallels between George's family (weak but loving father, emasculating, self-centered mother) and the family he has formed with his own wife and daughter.The biggest failure of the film comes in its clunky attempts to make George into some kind of admirable, sympathetic figure.  Fully the last half hour of the film is spent showing us just what an ""innocent victim of circumstance"" George turns out to be.  Even when he is trying his damnedest to go straight, the vagaries of fate keep conspiring against him to draw him back into the world of crime and prison.  We are supposed to feel sorry for him because he can't seem to get his life together well enough to be able to raise the daughter he so obviously loves.  Yet, when he is finally given the chance to prove his love to her by supporting her and her mother financially, what does he end up doing but arranging for yet another (and in this case abortive) drug deal.  It is one thing to provide us with an emotionally complex, morally ambiguous character.  It is quite another to expect us to feel pity for a man whose modus operandi is that of sheer stupidity.  All our empathy for the character ends up flying out the window and all we can do basically is to feel that the character got what was coming to him.As George, Johnny Depp seems to be sleepwalking through the part, although it may not be entirely his fault.

538891,A2RN2AO4BE6F4K,B00003CXWU,"Scott Bright ""scottypotty""","[5, 5]","Movie Summary: George Jung moves to California and discovers drugs. He is an ambitious young man and soon takes to selling pot. He quickly builds a large marijuana business and gets rich. This operation gets broken up when George gets busted and sent to prison. He goes to prison with a bachelors degree in pot and leaves with a PHD in cocaine. Once out of prison George hooks up with his former cell mate and starts building an immense cocaine empire.My Opinion: The music in Blow is awesome. It is what stood out the most for me. It adds depth and excitement to the film. I was tapping my foot more than once while watching the movie. The story was engaging while I was watching it, but didn't stay with me after I was done watching it. It fails to make a stand on what it is saying. It shows George's life and leaves the viewer to make any decision. It leans towards showing him as a good guy who just keeps screwing up. I got the feeling that he saw his only mistakes as getting caught. Johnny Depp is excellent as the main character. He is very cool and likable. I have a feeling he makes George look way better than he actually was. I found Pen&eacute;lope Cruz and her character to be very annoying. Her character was suppose to be a reflection of George's mom, but I still found her lacking. Paul Reubens is great as the California drug connection/hair dresser. This should help his career a little. The story and direction are very stylish and smooth. The scenes that were removed help fill in the plot, but they would have slowed things down. Overall I found the movie lacked punch. The music made it good while I was watching it, but I quickly forgot it when it was over.DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen Anamorphic 2.35:1 Excellent video quality. Sound: DD 5.1 Extras: This is an Infinifilm edition. This means that it is packed with extras that are accessible while watching the movie. These extras include: Deleted scenes that help fill out the plot, interview with the real George Yung (man is he ugly!), commentary, documentaries, trailers, character outtakes, and production diary. This is a fully packed DVD release.What You Should Do: Rent it. It's a decent story to see once but it doesn't have repeatability. The extras make it a really great DVD release, but I can't see wanted to watch the real George Jung more than once!Related Movies To Check Out: Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco, Scarface, Casino",3,From a Bachelors in Marijuana to a PHD in Cocaine,1001548800,"09 27, 2001",2001,2414,"['Movie', 'Summary', 'George', 'Jung', 'California', 'discovers', 'drugs', 'ambitious', 'young', 'man', 'soon', 'selling', 'pot', 'quickly', 'large', 'marijuana', 'business', 'rich', 'operation', 'broken', 'up', 'when', 'George', 'busted', 'sent', 'prison', 'prison', 'bachelors', 'degree', 'pot', 'PHD', 'cocaine', 'Once', 'prison', 'George', 'up', 'former', 'cell', 'mate', 'building', 'immense', 'cocaine', 'empire.My', 'Opinion', 'music', 'Blow', 'awesome', 'what', 'stood', 'out', 'most', 'depth', 'excitement', 'film', 'was', 'tapping', 'foot', 'more', 'once', 'watching', 'movie', 'story', 'was', 'engaging', 'was', 'watching', 'did', ""n't"", 'stay', 'was', 'done', 'watching', 'make', 'stand', 'what', 'saying', 'George', 'life', 'viewer', 'make', 'decision', 'towards', 'showing', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'keeps', 'screwing', 'up', 'got', 'feeling', 'saw', 'only', 'mistakes', 'getting', 'caught', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'excellent', 'main', 'character', 'very', 'cool', 'likable', 'have', 'feeling', 'George', 'look', 'way', 'better', 'actually', 'was', 'found', 'Pen', 'eacute', 'Cruz', 'character', 'be', 'very', 'annoying', 'character', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'reflection', 'George', 'mom', 'still', 'found', 'lacking', 'Paul', 'Reubens', 'great', 'California', 'drug', 'connection/hair', 'dresser', 'should', 'help', 'career', 'little', 'story', 'direction', 'are', 'very', 'stylish', 'smooth', 'scenes', 'were', 'removed', 'help', 'fill', 'plot', 'would', 'have', 'slowed', 'things', 'down', 'Overall', 'found', 'movie', 'lacked', 'punch', 'music', 'made', 'good', 'was', 'watching', 'quickly', 'forgot', 'when', 'was', 'over.DVD', 'Quality', 'Video', 'Widescreen', 'Anamorphic', '2.35:1', 'Excellent', 'video', 'quality', 'Sound', 'DD', '5.1', 'Extras', 'Infinifilm', 'edition', 'packed', 'extras', 'are', 'accessible', 'watching', 'movie', 'extras', 'include', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'help', 'fill', 'out', 'plot', 'interview', 'real', 'George', 'Yung', 'man', 'ugly', 'commentary', 'documentaries', 'trailers', 'character', 'outtakes', 'production', 'diary', 'fully', 'packed', 'DVD', 'Should', 'Do', 'Rent', 'decent', 'story', 'see', 'once', ""n't"", 'have', 'repeatability', 'extras', 'make', 'really', 'great', 'DVD', 'release', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'wanted', 'watch', 'real', 'George', 'Jung', 'more', 'once', 'Related', 'Movies', 'Check', 'Out', 'Goodfellas', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'Scarface', 'Casino']",N/A

538895,AEE2GJR0VF6R7,B00003CXWU,Silo 51,"[3, 4]","Johnny Depp did a terrific job acting, while Penelope Cruz did not. This movie focused on one line said by Johnny's father when he was little, when you are high you don't realize it, and when you are low, you think you will never get better. The story was about ups and downs in life. Drug business as portrayed here was a tremendous wealth machine, yet very treacherous, riskier than all else. Johnny played a kid from a poor family with little education but a huge dream and much intelligence who went to LA, and searched for a new life of happiness and wealth. He soon found his dream selling drugs, it was the 60s. With friends help, he became rich in a short time. This first up seemed so attractive, so wonderful, that I for a while was confused about whether the movie was promoting drugs or not. The girls, the houses, the parties, the coolness, everything was perfect. But the movie then took a down turn, Jonny was arrested. The prison, which he fondly called as the ""criminal school"", kept him for two years. With friends made there, he started new ventures with the columbia drug lords after getting out. It seemed so easy, so safe, a plane, a pilot, and off you go, make millions of dollar everyday. His business became bigger, and was for a while the major dealer in US with his old LA connections. Then, Penelope Cruz came in. It was a very sudden thing, I almost forgot she was in the movie. The happy days went on. He smoked more, had a kid, old partner betrayed, got out of the business completely. From then on, what seemed to be a happy ending went down hill. He for different innocent reasons went to prison two times, the second time serving for 60 years. His kids would not talk to him, wife divorced. The movie ended in prison.It was a very fascinating story, better than most of the non-sense now days. The directing and acting was superb too, and with a meaning. I believe, with this condensed life from paradise to hell, people would think twice before they decide to be a drug dealer or use drugs. What I didn't like was that the story seemed a bit passionless, and didn't really show the ture nasty things that drug could do to you like Traffic did. (But the movie over all was better than Traffic). ...the bad actings from Penelope, the role she had was not of her type. But I do suggest you to watch this movie, get entertained and educated.

538901,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00003CXWU,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","I have always believed, with an exception here and there, that Johnny Depp was extremely overrated as an actor. His good looks, combined with his outlandish characters, often earn him more credit than he deserves. Having watched the film, Blow, for the first time this weekend, It was very easy to see that Depp does in fact have a lot of talent, and can play more than just a Disney character with too much make-up. I though Depp was good in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but he gives, by far, his best performance to date in Blow. For those unfamiliar with this true story, Depp plays George Jung, an American who worked for the Median Cartel and was responsible for bringing in an estimated 80% of all the cocaine in The United States, during the 70s and 80s. The story starts with his suburban upbringing and follows his rise to power and finally his fall from grace. Blow was very reminiscent of the kind of film you usually see from Leonard DiCaprio, and while he would have done a nice job in the lead, even he would be hard pressed to top the performance given by Johnny Depp. In the performance of a lifetime, Depp takes you through every aspect of this mans life with ease and really gave us a rare, inside look into Pablo Escobar's operation. He's paired with the lovely Penelope Cruz, who was a disaster playing Jung's wife. Her performance was nominated for a Razzie, as the worst female performance of the year, with good reason. Throughout the film, She's hard to understand and often times screaming like a lunatic. Her character was a very important part of Jung's life and they couldn't have done a worse job of casting. They needed a good looking Latin American woman to portray the part and Cruz was the top name at the time, but her sloppy performance really takes away from an interesting film. I found Blow to be a fascinating look into the other side of the war on drugs. Often times we only hear about what the FBI is doing, but not about the trade itself. Blow is original, cutting edge, and really a terrific film that shouldn't be missed.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078,1374537600,"07 23, 2013",2013,2065,"['have', 'always', 'believed', 'exception', 'here', 'there', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'was', 'extremely', 'overrated', 'actor', 'good', 'looks', 'combined', 'outlandish', 'characters', 'often', 'earn', 'more', 'credit', 'Having', 'watched', 'film', 'Blow', 'first', 'time', 'weekend', 'was', 'very', 'easy', 'see', 'Depp', 'fact', 'have', 'lot', 'talent', 'can', 'play', 'more', 'just', 'Disney', 'character', 'too', 'much', 'make-up', 'Depp', 'was', 'good', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'far', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'Blow', 'unfamiliar', 'true', 'story', 'Depp', 'George', 'Jung', 'American', 'who', 'worked', 'Median', 'Cartel', 'was', 'responsible', 'bringing', 'estimated', '80', '%', 'cocaine', 'United', 'States', '70s', '80s', 'story', 'suburban', 'upbringing', 'rise', 'power', 'finally', 'fall', 'grace', 'Blow', 'was', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'kind', 'film', 'usually', 'see', 'Leonard', 'DiCaprio', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'nice', 'job', 'lead', 'even', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'top', 'performance', 'given', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'Depp', 'aspect', 'life', 'ease', 'really', 'gave', 'rare', 'inside', 'look', 'Pablo', 'Escobar', 'operation', 'paired', 'lovely', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'who', 'was', 'disaster', 'playing', 'Jung', 'wife', 'performance', 'was', 'nominated', 'Razzie', 'worst', 'female', 'performance', 'year', 'good', 'reason', 'film', 'hard', 'understand', 'often', 'times', 'screaming', 'lunatic', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'important', 'part', 'Jung', 'life', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'worse', 'job', 'casting', 'needed', 'good', 'looking', 'Latin', 'American', 'woman', 'portray', 'part', 'Cruz', 'was', 'top', 'name', 'time', 'sloppy', 'performance', 'really', 'away', 'interesting', 'film', 'found', 'Blow', 'be', 'fascinating', 'look', 'other', 'side', 'war', 'drugs', 'Often', 'only', 'hear', 'what', 'FBI', 'doing', 'not', 'trade', 'Blow', 'original', 'cutting', 'edge', 'really', 'terrific', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'missed']",N/A
538902,A1K2ACRU9YJS17,B00003CXWU,"Tsila Sofer Elguez ""Tsila Sofer Elguez""","[1, 5]","This is a story of a ""good boy"" turned into a big drug dealer, including all the usual elements- the way up, the pretty wife, the cars, the riches, the betrayal of a good friend and then all the way down. Sounds familiar? Yes, you have seen it in ""Scar face"" and other movies of the same kind, only there the story was more interesting; Cruel maybe, but with some reasoning - you could understand the motives behind the actions of the heroes (be it to advance, to prove their power, to control) and you got immersed in the logic of the drug world.  This movie on the other hand is neither convincing in its logic or characters nor presented in an interesting manner. Contrary to what we expect the movie is also non violent and this fact (which in other cases could have been appreciated by me) makes it not credible, or rather covering up the truth more then disclosing as we know the events have truly happened.George, the `good boy"", played by Johnny Depp is presented as some kind of tragic hero. Someone who got involved in ""bad things"" but really just wanted to live in peace and quiet with his family...The only explanation we get for his turn to crime was that his mom always used to nag his dad for money...Everything his dad earned was not enough. George then promised himself that he will always have money.George gets into the drug business as if by mistake, just to earn some quick money for him and his friends (""these were great days""...he says with nostalgia). He was the mind behind the group of good kids and devises techniques of drug delivery while using his girlfriend Barbara as a carrier. The drugs are sold to other ""good kids"" from universities and colleges and the techniques of drug delivery grows more sophisticated as there is rise in demand. We never get to see the ""end customers"" or the final sale process which I assume could have been interesting to watch. Barbara dies from cancer (""I really loved her"") and George starts making big money by joining with the Boss, the famous Escobar, a symbol of the drug world and its corruption. However, not in this movie... The drug world presented here is clean of violence. The Colombian farmers are nave and nice and even the scene with Escobar is quite mellow, besides maybe one shot.  In George's jail periods we learn about the qualities of cocaine (good cocaine melts only in 86 degrees) but these facts seem to be the only gain from this movie.I have just seen Johnny Depp as a charming Pirate in the new film ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" where he just shines through - here however, except for his beauty there are no signs of the famous Depp magic. Here his beauty is not enough to save his role from total shallowness. His gestures and facial expressions are void of any true feelings.Penelope Cruz who plays the beautiful wife is one of my favorite actresses. However, I have to admit that even she does a lousy job here. Maybe it's not her fault as her role is of the spoiled rich wife who does nothing but be pretty and smoke drugs - however, her part is a pale replica of the part Michelle Pfeiffer does in scar face and she does not manage to look convincing, nor is it clear what besides her looks, drew George to her. Penelope Cruz hardly appears in the movie and I did not appreciate the fact that her picture is the one appearing on the cover of this movie. Ray Liota and Rachel Griffiths play George's parents, and although Ray Liota is convincing as the father, the mother seems the same age as her son and she does not seem to bring anything to this role.I must confess that in several parts this movie seems like an ""ordered movie"" to clean the name of George Jung or at least present him in a human light as the movie is so one sided and unconvincing. In the end we see George in prison, waiting and hoping that his daughter would come to visit... the movie is filled with manipulations such as this one who are meant to make you feel sorry for this man.",2,Shallow and non convincing.,1061078400,"08 17, 2003",2003,3950,"['story', 'good', 'boy', 'turned', 'big', 'drug', 'dealer', 'including', 'usual', 'elements-', 'way', 'up', 'pretty', 'wife', 'cars', 'riches', 'betrayal', 'good', 'friend', 'then', 'way', 'down', 'Sounds', 'familiar', 'Yes', 'have', 'seen', 'Scar', 'face', 'other', 'movies', 'same', 'kind', 'only', 'story', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'Cruel', 'maybe', 'reasoning', 'could', 'understand', 'motives', 'actions', 'heroes', 'be', 'advance', 'prove', 'power', 'control', 'got', 'immersed', 'logic', 'drug', 'world', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'convincing', 'logic', 'characters', 'presented', 'interesting', 'manner', 'Contrary', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'also', 'non', 'violent', 'fact', 'other', 'cases', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'appreciated', 'not', 'credible', 'rather', 'covering', 'up', 'truth', 'more', 'then', 'disclosing', 'know', 'events', 'have', 'truly', 'happened.George', 'good', 'boy', 'played', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'presented', 'kind', 'tragic', 'hero', 'Someone', 'who', 'got', 'involved', 'bad', 'things', 'really', 'just', 'wanted', 'live', 'peace', 'quiet', 'family', 'only', 'explanation', 'get', 'turn', 'crime', 'was', 'mom', 'always', 'used', 'nag', 'dad', 'money', 'Everything', 'dad', 'earned', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'George', 'then', 'promised', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'money.George', 'drug', 'business', 'mistake', 'just', 'earn', 'quick', 'money', 'friends', 'were', 'great', 'days', 'nostalgia', 'was', 'mind', 'group', 'good', 'kids', 'devises', 'techniques', 'drug', 'delivery', 'using', 'girlfriend', 'Barbara', 'carrier', 'drugs', 'are', 'sold', 'other', 'good', 'kids', 'universities', 'colleges', 'techniques', 'drug', 'delivery', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'rise', 'demand', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'end', 'customers', 'final', 'sale', 'process', 'assume', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Barbara', 'cancer', 'really', 'loved', 'George', 'making', 'big', 'money', 'joining', 'Boss', 'famous', 'Escobar', 'symbol', 'drug', 'world', 'corruption', 'However', 'not', 'movie', 'drug', 'world', 'presented', 'here', 'clean', 'violence', 'Colombian', 'farmers', 'are', 'nave', 'nice', 'even', 'scene', 'Escobar', 'quite', 'mellow', 'maybe', 'one', 'shot', 'George', 'jail', 'periods', 'learn', 'qualities', 'cocaine', 'good', 'cocaine', 'melts', 'only', '86', 'degrees', 'facts', 'seem', 'be', 'only', 'gain', 'movie.I', 'have', 'just', 'seen', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'charming', 'Pirate', 'new', 'film', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'where', 'just', 'here', 'however', 'beauty', 'are', 'signs', 'famous', 'Depp', 'magic', 'Here', 'beauty', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'role', 'total', 'shallowness', 'gestures', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'void', 'true', 'feelings.Penelope', 'Cruz', 'who', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'However', 'have', 'admit', 'even', 'lousy', 'job', 'here', 'Maybe', 'not', 'fault', 'role', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'wife', 'who', 'nothing', 'be', 'pretty', 'smoke', 'drugs', 'however', 'part', 'pale', 'replica', 'part', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'scar', 'face', 'not', 'manage', 'look', 'convincing', 'clear', 'what', 'looks', 'drew', 'George', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'hardly', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'picture', 'one', 'appearing', 'cover', 'movie', 'Ray', 'Liota', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'play', 'George', 'parents', 'Ray', 'Liota', 'convincing', 'father', 'mother', 'same', 'age', 'son', 'not', 'seem', 'bring', 'anything', 'role.I', 'must', 'confess', 'several', 'parts', 'movie', 'ordered', 'movie', 'clean', 'name', 'George', 'Jung', 'least', 'present', 'human', 'light', 'movie', 'so', 'one', 'sided', 'unconvincing', 'end', 'see', 'George', 'prison', 'waiting', 'hoping', 'daughter', 'would', 'come', 'visit', 'movie', 'filled', 'manipulations', 'such', 'one', 'who', 'are', 'meant', 'make', 'feel', 'sorry', 'man']",N/A

538907,AHTEDRC5XLKK0,B00003CXWU,"WebViking ""WebViking""","[3, 4]","Blow portrays the life and times of one George Jung, a real-life drug dealer currently serving a long prison sentence and not eligible for parole until 2015.  Ted Demme presents Jung's life as a series of montages, growing up in Massashusetts son of a hard-working man and a shrewish wife, moving to California with a childhood friend and becoming immersed in the marijuana trade, serving a stint in jail and meeting a Columbian who introduces him to cocaine, working his way up in Pablo Escobar's Medellin cartel and making more money than he can spend, betrayal by his colleagues and leaving the business, busted again with large amounts of cocaine in his house during his 38th birthday party, out of jail making amends with his daughter, doing one last job so he can retire to California with his daughter, getting busted yet again and sentenced to 60 years.  It's hard to tell how much of the stroy is real and how much is a product of George Jung's imagination, but in the end Demme had no choice but to trust Jung's portrayal of his life.  To Demme's credit (and maybe Jung's) the movie doesn't deify Jung's life.  He made his decisions for whatever reasons good or bad.  We can guess what his motivations were, and decide whatever we want to about his decisions.  In the end, Jung's life is yet another largely wasted by drugs.  Whatever your opinions are on drugs, this movie's portrayal of Jung's life is largely neutral on the political questions.  That's one reason I rate it so highly.  It doesn't glamorize drugs, nor does it make any judgements on the penalties that Jung ends up getting because of his involvement in the drug trade.George Jung is played masterfully by Johnny Depp.  Is there any question who is the best actor of his generation?  Depp is brilliant in this movie.  Ray Liotta is superb as Depp's father as well.  The rest of the cast was good except for Penelope Cruz's incoherent portrayal of George Jung's drug addled wife.The movie covers a lot of ground and lacks some of the detail you might expect because of it.
