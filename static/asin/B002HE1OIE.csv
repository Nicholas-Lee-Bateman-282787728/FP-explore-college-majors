The moves they did were in no way natural movements it's like they were just trying to find some filler moves.  I only used it once and then resold it.,1,Strange Moves,1365465600,"04 9, 2013",2013,209,"['love', 'jazzercize', 'DVD', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'cut', 'moves', 'did', 'were', 'way', 'natural', 'movements', 'were', 'just', 'trying', 'find', 'filler', 'moves', 'only', 'used', 'once', 'then', 'resold']",N/A

Today was my first time  using it, and I bought it because I purchased Jazzercise Live and absolutely loved that!So I decided to get this. This is wonderful abdominal workout, it also works the legs and arms as well. The music is great since it is music you can easily workout to. I had read the other reviews and someone said the music was inaudible over the talking by the hosts. I did not find this to be true at all, sure they talk and cue you into the next move, but they do not have conversations or anything, and the music is loud enough for everyone to hear it. The talking and the music do not overpower anything, well to me anyway. I would recommend to anyone who loves to dance and wants to pump up their abdominals without getting on the floor.5 stars!!",5,Dancin Abs by Jazzercise,1367193600,"04 29, 2013",2013,809,"['thought', 'exercise', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Today', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'using', 'bought', 'purchased', 'Jazzercise', 'Live', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'So', 'decided', 'get', 'wonderful', 'abdominal', 'workout', 'also', 'legs', 'arms', 'well', 'music', 'great', 'music', 'can', 'easily', 'workout', 'had', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'someone', 'said', 'music', 'was', 'inaudible', 'talking', 'hosts', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'be', 'true', 'sure', 'talk', 'cue', 'next', 'move', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'conversations', 'anything', 'music', 'loud', 'enough', 'everyone', 'hear', 'talking', 'music', 'do', 'not', 'overpower', 'anything', 'well', 'anyway', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'dance', 'pump', 'up', 'abdominals', 'getting', 'floor.5', 'stars']",N/A

I buy these for friends and tell random strangers about them I love them so much. So believe me when I say it was such a disappointment when this one arrived and was &#34;bleeeeh.&#34;  It's not terrible, but it's just not that good.  It's repetitive, more so than the others, it's moves are not nearly as interesting as the other two either. The others feel as if they move quickly, while this feels like it drags.  This one moves back and forth between the company's President (the blonde) and another instructor (the brunette). It just doesn't work.  I wanted to love it, I was geared up to love it, but I wouldn't buy it again. I hope that I use it a second time, because I hate wasting money. But it won't get in the rotation often. Sadly.

Young McCarthy's curvy figure gives me a major  confidence boost. All in all, the video id highly recommended. While the music isn't exactly jazz, it's very upbeat.I start off with the 30 minute workout.
