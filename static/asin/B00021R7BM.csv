Because that was the whole point.In the movie, the brutalized men become human again after reciting Shakespeare&Plato....;  For Heaven's sake, it was the Gospels that they were actually reading!!!I suppose it now will touch English Teachers deeply....but it no longer corresponds to reality...ALso....two nonfactual messages were slipped into the movie that made it more palatable to Politically Correct people, but was very offensive, insulting the memory of dead men.First:  the movie spreads the lie (originating from the grossly inaccurate film ""Bridge over the river kwai"") that the POW's gleefully helped the Jap's construction projects....projects that would help the Japs imperialist conquests of mass rape and civilian torture. (Do you know what the Japs did to the Chineses and Koreans? Its as evil top notch...ripped open pregnant women for sport, etc.)BUt in REALITY, Ernest GOrdon devoted a page of the book to DEBUNKING the whole lie. He clearly wrote that the men worked under watchful eyes of guards and whips, at point of bayonet, and whenever they could, SABOTAGED or shoddily built things on PURPOSE.Second: at the end of the film, the POW's stare at the liberating Allied soldiers as if they were some aliens from Mars. There is a hint of hostility, and a feeling that the POWs have now all become peaceniks.BUT in REALITY, Ernest Gordon writes, they hoisted some stunned paratroopers onto their shoulders, and shouted themselves hoarse with joy, hoisting up a Union Jack onto the flagpole....THere. I had to set the record straight.I know the directors probably didn't want to be ""preachy"", but for heaven's sake, ERNEST GORDON BECAME A PREACHER.

820831,A1W7JW829H45AE,B00021R7BM,"Charles M. Strnad ""Washed up jock""","[7, 8]","I first read about ""To End All Wars"" in a movie review in World magazine(a Christian faith publication), and then was astonished when it was released to only a few movie theatres in the US (mostly on the West Coast), and then only for a brief period of time. I had read the book by Ernest Gordon (on which the movie was based), and coupled with the reviews (all of which were very favorable), I bought the DVD as soon as it was released, sight unseen. To this day it remains one of my favorite movies about war- both for it's uncompromising, gritty realism (in telling the true story of the Burma ""Death Railway""), and more significantly, for the enduring and thought-provoking message that it so effectively communicates. All good movies about war, in my mind, have in common the ability to go beyond the action, beyond the suffering and violence, and to raise from all the ashes something profound about human nature, and man's inhumanity to man.""To End All Wars"" is a first-rate movie production: on location cinematography, compelling acting performances by all the actors, a haunting musical score, and uncompromising realism in telling a story of extreme (though all too common) brutality and suffering. This is no made-for-TV affair - the production values are A+.The few other reviewer comments on profanity in the movie, and a ""watering-down"" of the overt Christian message of Gordon's book didn't bother me at all; I rather imagine this movie was not made with a fundamental church-going audience in mind. Rather, by presenting a true story and being faithful to the times and events of those times, I think this movie gains a measure of respectability for any audience, and only makes the eventual message of forgiveness all the more powerful.For you see, this movie is, above all else, about forgiveness....REAL forgiveness, not just a word we use to appease our guilty conscience, but the ""working end"" of the idea- that is, forgiveness that means real action....forgiving those who persecute, hate, and even kill you. The POW's of the Death Railway camp portrayed in this film survived unimaginable physical and mental hardships, in no small measure (perhaps mainly) because of discovering faith, meaning, and ultimately salvation - amidst the worst of human conditions. The last 10-15 minutes of this film, where this message is conveyed so powerfully, are among the most gripping and memorable images I've ever seen on film.I'd highly recommend this movie to anyone who is not uncomfortable with confronting the ugliness within the human heart, in order to find it's greatest rewards.",5,Real forgiveness,1197244800,"12 10, 2007",2007,2600,"['first', 'read', 'End', 'Wars', 'movie', 'review', 'World', 'magazine', 'Christian', 'faith', 'publication', 'then', 'was', 'astonished', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'only', 'few', 'movie', 'theatres', 'US', 'mostly', 'West', 'Coast', 'then', 'only', 'brief', 'period', 'time', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'Ernest', 'Gordon', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'coupled', 'reviews', 'were', 'very', 'favorable', 'bought', 'DVD', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'released', 'sight', 'unseen', 'day', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'war-', 'uncompromising', 'gritty', 'realism', 'telling', 'true', 'story', 'Burma', 'Death', 'Railway', 'more', 'significantly', 'enduring', 'thought-provoking', 'message', 'so', 'effectively', 'good', 'movies', 'war', 'mind', 'have', 'common', 'ability', 'go', 'action', 'suffering', 'violence', 'raise', 'ashes', 'something', 'profound', 'human', 'nature', 'man', 'inhumanity', 'man', 'End', 'Wars', 'first-rate', 'movie', 'production', 'location', 'cinematography', 'compelling', 'acting', 'performances', 'actors', 'haunting', 'musical', 'score', 'uncompromising', 'realism', 'telling', 'story', 'extreme', 'too', 'common', 'brutality', 'suffering', 'made-for-TV', 'affair', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'A+.The', 'few', 'other', 'reviewer', 'comments', 'profanity', 'movie', 'watering-down', 'overt', 'Christian', 'message', 'Gordon', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'rather', 'imagine', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'fundamental', 'church-going', 'audience', 'mind', 'presenting', 'true', 'story', 'being', 'faithful', 'times', 'events', 'times', 'think', 'movie', 'gains', 'measure', 'respectability', 'audience', 'only', 'eventual', 'message', 'forgiveness', 'more', 'powerful.For', 'see', 'movie', 'else', 'forgiveness', '.REAL', 'forgiveness', 'not', 'just', 'word', 'use', 'appease', 'guilty', 'conscience', 'working', 'end', 'idea-', 'forgiveness', 'real', 'action', '.forgiving', 'who', 'persecute', 'hate', 'even', 'kill', 'POW', 'Death', 'Railway', 'camp', 'portrayed', 'film', 'survived', 'unimaginable', 'physical', 'mental', 'hardships', 'small', 'measure', 'perhaps', 'mainly', 'discovering', 'faith', 'meaning', 'ultimately', 'salvation', 'amidst', 'worst', 'human', 'conditions', 'last', '10-15', 'minutes', 'film', 'where', 'message', 'conveyed', 'so', 'powerfully', 'are', 'most', 'gripping', 'memorable', 'images', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film.I', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'uncomfortable', 'confronting', 'ugliness', 'human', 'heart', 'order', 'find', 'greatest', 'rewards']",To End All Wars

820838,A1X9OJN30EBE3M,B00021R7BM,Dr. Karl O. Edwards,"[8, 10]","I came across the wonderful masterpiece by happenstance of ""surfing"" lists on Amazon.  Seeing that the vast majority of the reviews were five stars and the film had Kiefer Sutherland, I decided to purchase ""To End All Wars.""  I am so glad I did.In preparing to write this review, I read the other reviews, starting with the one star reviews, to see what had already been emphasized--both positive and negative.  I was taken aback at many of the comments made, and the ""controversies"" many viewers had with ""To End All Wars.""  Call me jaded, or anything else, but I do not see why this film has been criticized and/or labeled for being: 1) an anti-war movie; 2) a graphically violent or gory film; 3) an ""unfaithful"" rendition of the book (an aspect I cannot comment on, as I have not read the book); and 4) a movie that has--depending on the reviewer--to much or too little of a ""Christian message.""  Moreover, I have found my self challenged by the intriguing question:  Why do I watch a movie?  Entertainment?  If entertainment, what is entertainment?What I see in ""To End All Wars"" is a brilliant presentation, on a ""limited"" budget, concerning a part of World War II that many people do not like to ""think about.""  I see a semi-autobiographical account as seen through the ""eyes"" (and memories) of one survivor.  I see a film that details the fact that the story teller, along with a few other other prisoners of war (POWs) survived an amazing feat; (nearly 50% of the Asian and 25%--16,000+--of the Allied prisoners that worked on the railroad died).  ""To End All Wars"" brilliantly captures the nature of this horrendous experience, to the degree that an ""R"" rating would allow.  What I do not see is a movie debating ""Vengeance or Forgiveness,"" ""Pain and Pleasure,"" ""Redemption, Forgiveness, Brutality,"" ""Sadism,"" or ""Christianity.""  And to find ""To End All Wars"" boring, is to find life and drama boring.I have not read the book that the movie is based upon, so I cannot comment on how much detail Ernest Gordon goes into with regards to the treatment of the prisoners (or comment on the films ""faithfulness"" to his book).  But I have seen other testimonies and pictures, and I can safely state that the movie is ""soft core"" with regards to the treatment, conditions, interactions, and violence endured by the POWs--""To End All Wars,"" as far as I am concerned, is NOT graphically violent or gory--especially for an ""R"" rated movie.  Despite this, I feel the film gets the point across, just as it makes clear why any attempt to escape would be futile, why so many were suffering, and why the author's decision to ""teach"" was so helpful to the survivors.In deed, I would argue that it is the fault of our own ""arrogant"" and ""prudent"" denial of reality, as found in our educational systems and other social organizations, that prevented ""To End All Wars"" to truly portray what happened.  Why does the movie not show more of what happened to the Asians working on the railroad?  Why does the film not address the gruesomeness the people sent to work on the Burma/Death Railway endured just to get to the camps?  Why does the movie not address what happened to the Japanese who were involved in these ""war crimes?""  Why does the movie not tell what happened to the other POWs?  I am guessing, one reason is that movies today cannot go over two hours; but, I suspect the greater reasons are that viewers don't really desire to know ""the bald facts,"" and because showing everything would have resulted in some form of ""Adults Only"" rating.  With that in mind, if ""To End All Wars"" had been able to truly portray what happened, then I would agree with those who call the film an ""anti-war"" movie, because it just might have had such an effect upon the viewer.But I do not believe that the makers of ""To End All Wars"" were overtly trying to make an anti-war movie; (if they were, they failed).  Nor can I believe that someone as noble and brave as Ernest Gordon (based upon my research for this review) would be totally ""anti-war.""  I believe he would think more along the lines--as he clearly did when he enlisted--that war is sometimes a necessary evil.  And the ""message"" I got from ""To End All Wars"" was: Honor those who fought/fight--regardless of their beliefs or which ""side"" of the war they were serving.  If this is a ""Christian message,"" then it is; but, it is, more importantly, a human message understood by all who have endured many forms of violence--war in particular.As for the language, I think that the director did an incredible job of ""covering up"" the dialog that would have been/is used on a daily basis by people caught in such an environment.  If the viewer is so easily offended, they should stick with ""fantasy"" films.  Even more germane to this film, is if Ernest Gordon did not use the vernacular of the everyday soldier, let alone that of prisoners under extreme duress, in his book, then I say the makers of ""To End All Wars"" were obliged to ignore Mr Gordon's prudence.  The fact that Ernest Gordon ""started"" a school to help keep moral up, and that one of the books available was the Bible never once lead me to the conclusion that this was a ""Christian"" movie.  Indeed, what I remember most is: 1) that the thoughts of Shakespeare and Plato were integrated with those of the Bible and the Japanese ""bushido"" ideologies; and 2) how these ideas impacted upon the men involved.  Perhaps even more impressive was the presentation of how the ""refreshed"" attitudes (from their ""schooling"") of these few men influenced the attitudes and lives of the rest of the camp--including the Japanese.For me, the role of ""faith,"" was not that of Christian faith, but of human faith.  Again, without having read the book, I have no idea to what degree Christian faith influenced Ernest Gordon before his camp experiences, but as a sociologist I do know how individuals who have been around Christian thinking will quickly turn to the Bible--or their ""remembrance"" of the Bible--when they find themselves in situations they cannot fathom; just as individuals of other religions ""turn"" to their ""remembrances"" of whatever source of ""faith"" they have encountered.  And there in-lies one of the beauties of the ""school:""  ""faith"" was found by some POWS in the Bible, by others in Shakespeare, yet other POWs took faith from Plato and other writers, and other POWs discovered faith in music and drama.  Others turned to the darker side (brought out so well in ""King Rat"") for their faith, as aptly found in an American POW--portrayed with greatness by Kiefer Sutherland as Lt. Jim Reardon--selfish materialism; albeit, Sutherland's character undergoes a transformation that is both longer and greater--and less appreciated and understood--than many of the other POWs.""To End All Wars"" walked a hard line, and in the final analysis, I truly believe it did a wonderful job.  All of the performances were superb.  I found myself involved with the characters, and living their lives (or at least feeling like I was).  The script, direction, and production are all stellar.  When a film, such as ""To End All Wars"" draws the viewer into the world they are portraying, I think that is what entertainment is all about.Please Note:  If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.

It's so obvious from all the POW memoirs as well as the films that the Japanese had NO business posing superior to these prisoners of theirs.  They probably NEVER did feel superior to their captives which fed their brutality.  What these films still do not show is that the Japanese were bored and had time on their hands and would play games with the prisoners in the same way as they toyed with Chinese families.  It's why the POWs from England, the United States and the families with children in Holland all were censored by their governments after the war.The Wages of Guilt: Memories of War in Germany and Japanindeed.John LOVES Yoko, you know?This movie is very much about the Scottish not belonging there - that's really the communication I am getting from it - not really about some sweeping epic or thoughtful war message.  Robert Carlyle isn't really given the material to decloak his special brand of awesome - it's really about his looking very young and vulnerable and more and more sun damaged - in reality.  A BIG WASTE of all of our best people all over the world because some people are uncommonly greedy and hateful.Even if only a few of the POWs were sent to Unit 731 and nanjing's Unit 164, the Westerners do know that there will be no softening of these tormenters.  Not only were they known to kill missionaries unlike the Chinese, but the beauty of the bones persist and is evident in the starved bones of the captives - a bone structure not shared with their captors, that and the HEART of the Allied soldiers always made the Japanese uncomfortable.  They will never trust in any performance of submission and inferiority no matter how expert.  The only use for Christianity is as sheep's clothing after they lose the war.  Taro Aso is a Christian.  So is the Empress of Japan.The POWs saw their youngest and tenderest treated like this:Beastly.One could say this was the making of Jack Bauer.  And Robert Carlyle makes an appearance in24: Redemptionwhich has to do with Slovakian-American (Vril member?)

820840,A6WYLA5ZTMFCR,B00021R7BM,Eagle Eye,"[2, 4]","The acting and authenticity of this film's set are excellent, but having read the book I was disappointed that the Christian message of the film wasn't more central and overt.  The book, and Ernest Gordon's life as he writes about it, are about the transforming power of a relationship with Christ, in the face of unimaginable evils and difficulties.  It was that faith that gave the prisoners hope and transformed their outlook.The makers of the film wanted to communicate that, but they evidently tried to do it in a ""cool"" way that they felt was socially relevant, a way that would attract people who are searching.  I guess they felt that a few ""f-bombs"" (profanity) thrown in would help do the trick, along with not talking too much about the Gospel.Don't get me wrong--I'm not advocating a legalistic stance on faith--and language like that was undoubtedly a part of the lexicon at that time.  But in this film it was gratuitous, and also makes it less likely that the wonderful story of the film can be shown as broadly as possible--to various ranges of age and different backgrounds.  In general, this film just seems to cower from talking too much about Christianity---in Gordon's book, the discussion sessions revolved around how to reconcile Christianity and a loving God with the terrible suffering that was going on all around.  But in the film, Plato's thoughts on a ""just society""  are highlighted more than Jesus and his message.  There are visual symbols and scenes that speak to it, but why not just come out with it?The Christian message is attractive to seekers precisely because it is different and a radical break from the world.  There's no need to water it down to make it more attractive.  In this case, trying to do that merely diluted the power of Gordon's original account--it was the love of Christ and its implications that transformed the Kwai camp--that's the ""miracle"" on the River Kwai that Gordon wrote about.  I'd encourage everyone to read his book.  It's currently being marketed with the same name as the film, though it originally appeared under the title Miracle on the River Kwai.",3,Good Film that Could Have Been So Much Better,1184716800,"07 18, 2007",2007,2122,"['acting', 'authenticity', 'film', 'set', 'are', 'excellent', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Christian', 'message', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'central', 'overt', 'book', 'Ernest', 'Gordon', 'life', 'are', 'transforming', 'power', 'relationship', 'Christ', 'face', 'unimaginable', 'evils', 'difficulties', 'was', 'faith', 'gave', 'prisoners', 'hope', 'transformed', 'outlook.The', 'makers', 'film', 'wanted', 'communicate', 'evidently', 'tried', 'do', 'cool', 'way', 'felt', 'was', 'socially', 'relevant', 'way', 'would', 'attract', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'searching', 'guess', 'felt', 'few', 'f-bombs', 'profanity', 'thrown', 'would', 'help', 'do', 'trick', 'not', 'talking', 'too', 'much', 'Gospel.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'not', 'advocating', 'legalistic', 'stance', 'faith', 'language', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'part', 'lexicon', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'gratuitous', 'also', 'less', 'likely', 'wonderful', 'story', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'shown', 'as', 'broadly', 'possible', 'various', 'ranges', 'age', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'general', 'film', 'just', 'cower', 'talking', 'too', 'much', 'Christianity', '-in', 'Gordon', 'book', 'discussion', 'sessions', 'revolved', 'how', 'reconcile', 'Christianity', 'loving', 'God', 'terrible', 'suffering', 'was', 'going', 'around', 'film', 'Plato', 'thoughts', 'just', 'society', 'are', 'highlighted', 'more', 'Jesus', 'message', 'are', 'visual', 'symbols', 'scenes', 'speak', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'come', 'out', 'Christian', 'message', 'attractive', 'seekers', 'precisely', 'different', 'radical', 'break', 'world', 'need', 'water', 'down', 'make', 'more', 'attractive', 'case', 'trying', 'do', 'merely', 'diluted', 'power', 'Gordon', 'original', 'account', 'was', 'love', 'Christ', 'implications', 'transformed', 'Kwai', 'camp', 'miracle', 'River', 'Kwai', 'Gordon', 'wrote', ""'d"", 'encourage', 'everyone', 'read', 'book', 'currently', 'being', 'marketed', 'same', 'name', 'film', 'originally', 'appeared', 'title', 'Miracle', 'River', 'Kwai']",To End All Wars

Anyway....I just wasn't that impressed, probably because it seemed to be a pastiche of too many other movies. I felt as though I were watching parts of Bridge on the River Kwai, Empire of the Sun, Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence, King Rat and The Great Escape.Many aspects of the movie were fine. The acting, cinematography, editing, etc. were all fine. For my money it failed at the script level. Things progress through the first two acts well enough, (even though you're reminded of those other movies), but in the third act the entire thing falls apart. I understood it but I didn't believe it. It all seemed way too forced. I cannot be a spoiler by divulging the events, but as much as I would like to believe people would act with as much nobility as do these POWs, the years under my belt tell me no. This was a savage and harsh reality. What these men went through should never have to be endured by anyone, anytime. To think that, as the tide turns, these same men would take the high ground severely taxes credulity.As unbelievable as the ending is, it's also very heavy handed. The religious imagery is so overt and over the top it made me wince.Overall this is not a bad movie by any means. It certainly doesn't hurt to watch.

820844,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00021R7BM,Grady Harp,"[12, 15]","TO END ALL WARS is one of the most powerful films about the ability of the human heart tot survive and be transformed under the most adverse conditions.  The pity, here, is that this exceptionally moving film never made it to the theaters, probably because it was made and ready to release as we plunged into the war in Iraq - and if ever there could be a time when stories such as this should be related to the public, that time is emphatically now.About another war (WW II), this story is taken from the book by the man who experienced it - Ernest Gordon: the subject deals with truth and as directed by David L. Cunningham it becomes biographically factual as well as timeless in message.  A Scottish regiment has been captured by the Japanese and along with other Allied Forces, this band of brothers is kept in a prisoner of war camp in Thailand for the purpose of building a railway from Thailand to Burma.  They are led by a sturdy Scotsman (James Cosmo)who early in the story meets his death for his conviction that his men should resist the enemy.  His leadership role is taken over by the major (Robert Carlyle) who maintains a sense of military duty despite the torrid conditions under which he and his boys live.  Ernest Gordon (Ciaran McMenamin) and Dusty (Mark Strong) care for the mental stability of the prisoners by teaching the men the Bible, Plato, and Shakespeare.  The leaders of the Japanese (Sakae Kimura and Masayuki Yui) speak to the prisoners through the Oxford-educated translator Takashi Nagare (Yugo Saso) who we feel early on has more compassion for the prisoners' plight than would be appropriate for an enemy. There is a Yankee (Kiefer Sutherland) who quietly runs a black market, is caught and is severely tortured as his fellow prisoners look on.  The railway is ultimately completed by the prisoners and as they begin their celebration (and graduation form Gordon's humanistic studies) the Allied Forces planes fly over and the beginning of the end is at hand.  How these prisoners and their captors culminate this experience speaks very heavily about the sanctity of the human spirit and soul and though the ending is not expected, it is deeply moving.The message here is magnificent: War is absurd and cruel and insane and  will always be that as long as wars recur.

These are the issues explored in this moving film about the power of Christian forgiveness.What takes more courage? To plunge a knife into your enemy, or to lay down your life for another? The answers presented here will make many uncomfortable, especially those who view Christ's words of love as ""superstition,"" like the Japanese officer in the film. But what else could inspire us to love and forgiveness, instead of hatred and vengeance? The answer they would like to avoid is: nothing. There is no other answer but the supernatural, transforming love that is on display in various forms in this film.What of those who believe that human beings exist to serve the State? That their lives are worth ""less than a feather""? They will also despise the message of human worth here.P.S. While watching I was reminded of the book, ""Flyboys,"" which I have reviewed, and I felt the need to reiterate one point: my disgust at the author's attempt to equate incidents of American brutality towards the Japanese with the Japanese's systematic and horrific treatment of non-Japanese, white and Asian alike.

I think it is the same basic story and may be based on the same source material (though ""River Kwai"" is also from a Pierre Boulle novel). But, the basic form of the story and the origins may be the same, but midway through the movie it is clear that ""To End All Wars"" is going in a different direction. We are still set in World War II and we are still in Burma and Thailand building the railroad. There are still British Prisoners of War (Scottish this time) and one American (this time played by Keifer Sutherland) and they are being poorly treated in the prison camp and made to build this railroad on meager rations. They are brutalized for not bowing, and for doing anything out of line or that would make the Japanese ""lose face"".But through the movie there is a string of hope, of grace. That through kindness in the face of brutality, of turning the other cheek and of sacrifice, that the prisoners can gain respect (from their captors and self respect) as well as better treatment. The railroad is almost an afterthought here.I had never heard of this movie until a friend recommended it to me, and then another friend. I still didn't expect too much from ""To End All Wars"", but it turns out that this is a quality movie. Well made, well acted, and very moving. There is a spiritual side to ""To End All Wars"" with a bit of the Christian teaching running through it. It's not overwhelming or preachy, but it is effective and there is a very strong and overt Christ image but not quite the way it was expected and how that plays out isn't such that it bangs your head with Christ.Well done.

On closer inspection, I became suspicious and suspected an apology and justification for Japanese war crimes. Just moments into it, I flipped the otehr way and thought it would be an acurate (as to the horrors of the Japanese treatment of prisoners) but shallow, depicting all Japanese as monsters and all allies as saints. Neither suspicion was well founded.The brutality and horror of the Japanese treatment of POWs is graphically protrayed here. Some survivors who have seen it have horrified me by indicating that the movie pulled some of its punches and the reality was even worse. The thought that that could be true is utterly terrifying but does not detract from this film's ability to realistically protray that brutality. The film also protrays some virtues on some Japanese. The ugly facts are present but so too are some acts of humanity.Neither were all the allied parts played as some sort of supermen. They had their good points and their bad. On balance, they WERE the good guys. That does not stop them from having the same assortment of humanity, with all its goods and ills, that any large gathering could be expected to have.The story of the movie is fairly simple. Prisoners from the 93rd Regiment, the Argylle and Sutherland Highlanders, are forced to labor on a military railway by their Japanese captors. With them is a single American officer. The movie depicts the story of their mistreatment and their efforts to survive the horrors. Part of their approach in maintaining a degree of civilization amidst the barbarity is to run a ""school"". The school teaches such subjects as philosophy, music, drama, ethics and even Christian doctrine. They utilize whatever knowledge is possessed by the POWs. Some are skeptical but others thrive. The school gives hope. It is also apparent that the labors of the teachers bear fruit, especially with the concept of forgiveness. In the end, it is the ideas of forgiveness and redemption in the midst of suffering and brutality which are the point of the film.It seems that some commentators take exception to the Christian message protrayed. Too bad. The story is taken from the account of a serving officer who became a chaplain at Princeton after the war. His story is a Christian one. I have no doubt that someone of a different faith would have couched his message in different imagry but that would have been a different story, not this one.This is a powerful film. It cannot properly be calle entertainment (I hope) but it is still worthwhile. This graphic violence and suffering is difficult to take sometimes but the message is worth the effort.

820854,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B00021R7BM,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[1, 1]","To End All Wars covers much of the same ground as the classic The Bridge Over The River Kwai, not only in plotting but theme as well.A group of British soldiers (in this case Scottish) lead by a headstrong Colonel are brought to a Japanese prisoner of war camp in the middle of Thailand and put to work on the labor force to build a railroad through the jungle to India. In the face of deprivations and the cruelty of the Japanese the prisoners find ways to maintain their dignity and humanity. I half expected to see Alec Guiness or William Holden in a far off shot of the next prison camp over. Though Kiefer Sutherland does seem to playing the William Holden part, the roguish American thrown in with the bewildering British while he offers commonsense existential wisdom to the British stoicism.While this isn't a remake of Bridge Over The River Kwai the stories are remarkably similar, but that just maybe because the stories are set in the same proximity, time and of course the Japanese building the railroad. While Bridge is a fictional account To End All Wars is based on a true story by Ernest Gordon. This movie is much more realistic in its depiction of the cruelty and war crimes of the Japanese than Bridge was. It is also more realistic in the depiction of the living conditions, I believe going by the adage that if you tell the truth about war you have created an anti-war movie. The maintaining of dignity in this movie is much more complex undertaking than in Bridge, here Ernest starts teaching the prisoners, unbeknownst to the Japanese, of course.

820856,A329ALHKYK62O7,B00021R7BM,Ky. Col.,"[2, 2]","One of my Amazon friends initially recommended this film to me and after reading Ernest Gordon's powerful memoir ""To End all Wars"", I decided to give the film a try.  Rarely has a film surpassed my expectations as much as this one did.""To End all Wars"" is a fictionalized portrayal of the true story of Scottish Captain (and later chaplin at Princeton) Ernest Gordon's coming to faith while a POW working on the infamously brutal Thai Burma Railway built for the Japanes in WWII.  The film's subject matter alone gave it the potential to be a solid personalized War film.  Afterall I liked David Lean's even more fictionalized ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" set during the construction of the same railway.  In terms of drama though, ""To End all Wars"" blows Lean's film out of the water.The acting is solid from about every member of the cast.  Robert Carlyle gives a very memorable performance as a Scottish officer though frankly this film is full of excellent acting on both the Allied and Japanese sides.  While not possessing a huge budget compared to many major films, the cinematography gives a surprisingly epic feeling to the film as well as captures both the natural beauty and inhuman brutality depicted.  The film's musical score is very well composed and very appropriate.  Especially at the film's conclusion, photographs and footage of the real Ernest Gordon and historical locations add a special historical quality to the picture (one interesting photograph appears to be the real Bridge on the River Kwai after being bomber by Allied aircraft [note: the River apparently had a different name at the time]).What really caught my attention with ""To End all Wars"" was the film's graphic intensity and moral message.  This is a film which like Saving Private Ryan tries to capture the hellish nature of war. In the midst of appaling work conditions and cruelty from their Japanese guards, charachters choose whether to forgive or hate.  The film is generally from a Christian perspective and contains a strong religious allegory in one of the characters, though I think other reviewers were correct in noting that the filmakers played down some of the book's religious message.  ""To End all Wars"" has a great deal of violence and cursing.  However, neither is exploitative and are simply necessary gritty historical realities.  At times, I came close to tears, not a common occurance for me in most films.Overall, ""To End all Wars"" is a very powerful and well-made film.  It is also a film which brings important topics about faith and humanity.  I strongly recommend it though I caution viewers that it is realistically brutal and intense.",5,Very Intense Film.,1268092800,"03 9, 2010",2010,2650,"['One', 'Amazon', 'initially', 'recommended', 'film', 'reading', 'Ernest', 'Gordon', 'powerful', 'memoir', 'End', 'Wars', 'decided', 'give', 'film', 'try', 'Rarely', 'film', 'surpassed', 'expectations', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'did', 'End', 'Wars', 'fictionalized', 'portrayal', 'true', 'story', 'Scottish', 'Captain', 'later', 'chaplin', 'Princeton', 'Ernest', 'Gordon', 'coming', 'faith', 'POW', 'working', 'infamously', 'brutal', 'Thai', 'Burma', 'Railway', 'built', 'Japanes', 'WWII', 'film', 'subject', 'matter', 'alone', 'gave', 'potential', 'be', 'solid', 'personalized', 'War', 'film', 'Afterall', 'liked', 'David', 'Lean', 'even', 'more', 'fictionalized', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', 'set', 'construction', 'same', 'railway', 'terms', 'drama', 'End', 'Wars', 'Lean', 'film', 'water.The', 'acting', 'solid', 'member', 'cast', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'very', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Scottish', 'officer', 'frankly', 'film', 'full', 'excellent', 'acting', 'Allied', 'Japanese', 'sides', 'not', 'possessing', 'huge', 'budget', 'compared', 'many', 'major', 'films', 'cinematography', 'surprisingly', 'epic', 'feeling', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'captures', 'both', 'natural', 'beauty', 'inhuman', 'brutality', 'depicted', 'film', 'musical', 'score', 'very', 'well', 'composed', 'very', 'appropriate', 'Especially', 'film', 'conclusion', 'photographs', 'footage', 'real', 'Ernest', 'Gordon', 'historical', 'locations', 'add', 'special', 'historical', 'quality', 'picture', 'one', 'interesting', 'photograph', 'be', 'real', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', 'being', 'bomber', 'Allied', 'aircraft', '[', 'note', 'River', 'apparently', 'had', 'different', 'name', 'time', ']', 'really', 'caught', 'attention', 'End', 'Wars', 'was', 'film', 'graphic', 'intensity', 'moral', 'message', 'film', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'capture', 'hellish', 'nature', 'war', 'midst', 'appaling', 'work', 'conditions', 'cruelty', 'Japanese', 'guards', 'charachters', 'choose', 'forgive', 'hate', 'film', 'generally', 'Christian', 'perspective', 'strong', 'religious', 'allegory', 'one', 'characters', 'think', 'other', 'reviewers', 'were', 'correct', 'noting', 'filmakers', 'played', 'down', 'book', 'religious', 'message', 'End', 'Wars', 'great', 'deal', 'violence', 'cursing', 'However', 'exploitative', 'are', 'simply', 'necessary', 'gritty', 'historical', 'realities', 'times', 'came', 'close', 'tears', 'not', 'common', 'occurance', 'most', 'films.Overall', 'End', 'Wars', 'very', 'powerful', 'well-made', 'film', 'also', 'film', 'important', 'topics', 'faith', 'humanity', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'caution', 'viewers', 'realistically', 'brutal', 'intense']",To End All Wars

820860,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00021R7BM,Mark Turner,"[1, 2]","Over the years there have been a number of anti-war movies made. Each took the perspective of why it was bad and the consequences of those who would wage war. The outlook of this film differs in that it talks about the suffering of man, the ability of man to rise above his experiences and the way man can find humanity in himself.The film is narrated by Ernest Gordon (Ciaran McMenamin), a young man who joins the army because it was the right thing to do, only to find himself a prisoner of the Japanese in Thailand. Their captors demand respect and a following of the code of Bushido, a code that the allies are unfamiliar with. It becomes a hard lesson to learn but one that takes place, notably when their leader is killed before their eyes.Hardened by this event, the camp breaks down into two groups through a series of events. One is led by Campbell (Robert Carlyle). His group is planning escape from a prison where there is none. Buried in the jungle with no where to go, they have little hope of survival. But deep seated feelings of retribution lie in Campbell.The other group is led by Gordon and Dusty Miller (Mark Strong). This group has begun to meet secretly in an attempt to bring civility to the camp. In offering education to the prisoners beneath the noses of the Japanese, they regain the humanity that their captors have tried to strip from them.Between the two groups and fending for himself is Reardon (Kiefer Sutherland). The only Yank in the group, Reardon looks out for himself. Sutherland's part is more minor than usual, but he works it well. The change his character takes is a linchpin to the tale.While the Japanese force their prisoners to work for them, building the infamous ""Railway of Death"" between Thailand and Burma, the prisoners do their best to survive. And doing so in the face of their captors is what forms the drama of this film.The performances are solid all the way round. The look and feel of the film are well made. The film does lack one thing though. While the story is an important one to be told, based on fact, it lacks enough oomph to capture the viewer and hold on tight from beginning to end. Interesting yes, entertaining no.War film fans may enjoy this one. For the average viewer it will be a choice made when the hot new title is gone for the night at the local video store.

Rough, violent, crude, cruel are adjectives you may use to describe this film... yet it is also a hymn to compassion, love, self sacrifice, altruism and forgiveness.The story is based on Scotsman Ernst Gordon's book ""Through the Valley of the Kwai"" reflecting his actual experiences as POW.There are two precedent films that tell similar stories: ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" (1957) is one of them; ""Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence"" (1983) is the other one. With both of them the present opus relates and differs. ""To End..."" is as ruthless full of cruel violence as the second but whereabouts and historical events are the same as in ""The Bridge...""The film narrates the daily life of Allies prisoners in Japanese's hands. Specifically the Argyle Regiment, since they enter the POW camp until war's end.As in the precedent films ""To End..."" shows how different cultures collide and confront. The Japanese assumes British military are despicable because they have surrendered instead of continue fighting until death.The British resent and resist the brutal treatment they receive and scorn their captors as ""uncivilized barbarians"".Over this background ""To End..."" introduce a new vision of the conflict: how adherence to ""cultural virtues"" ends in abuse and senseless actions. Not only Japanese and their Bushido sense of honor and order are driven to violence; military honor and ethics drove Maj. Campbell to expose fellow inmates to authorities' fury.The other big issue of the film is how Christian commandment ""love your enemies"" is put into action by people who have been subject to utmost violence.Play acting is very good. Ciaran McMenamin as Gordon, Robert Carlyle as Maj. Campbell, James Cosmo (yes the unforgettable Scot warrior of ""Braveheart"") as the Colonel, Sakae Kimura as Sgt. Ito and Yugo Saso as Takashi Nagase amongst other deliver a high quality performance.Director David Cunningham imprints a deep Christian sense to the whole film.This is a great film, which cast a new light over these difficult relationships.

The words: powerful, life-changing, and inspiring are not hyperbolic in describing this faith-based true story. ""To End"" is akin to the iconic ""The Bridge Over The River Kwai"" in subject matter, theme, and the era of its occurrence (WW II).Soldiers from the UK are imprisoned in a Japanese Prisoner of War Camp in Thailand and are pushed to build a railroad line (Burma-Siam). The men are in the midst of dispossession and Japanese brutality as they seek to survive with self-respect and unflinching humanity. Kiefer Sutherland (should have earned an Oscar nomination) excels as an American who challenges the British mode of holding a stiff upper lip as one should just do your duty.""To End All Wars"" tells the true story of the POW Ernest Gordon. This movie is accurate to history in its presentation of the unlawful viciousness and the atrocities of the Japanese and with bad language earns its R rating (but the story requires therein).This is not just an anti-war flick that exposes Japan's war cruelties, but is a story which depicts the truth that redemption, forgiveness, and human dignity can be maintained and displayed even in the midst of repression, revenge, war, despair, and suffering.Buy this DVD, you will want to watch it every year on Memorial Day or Veteran's Day; stirring, deeply touching, and faith fortifying.There Are Moral Absolutes: How to Be Absolutely Sure That Christianity Alone Supplies",5,Faith and the End of Cruelty and War,1272931200,"05 4, 2010",2010,1554,"['Movies', 'present', 'lofty', 'transcendental', 'truths', 'are', 'seldom', 'devoid', 'clich', 'eacute', 'sloganeering', 'not', 'so', 'End', 'Wars', 'words', 'powerful', 'life-changing', 'inspiring', 'are', 'not', 'hyperbolic', 'describing', 'faith-based', 'true', 'story', 'End', 'akin', 'iconic', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', 'subject', 'matter', 'theme', 'era', 'occurrence', 'WW', 'II', '.Soldiers', 'UK', 'are', 'imprisoned', 'Japanese', 'Prisoner', 'War', 'Camp', 'Thailand', 'are', 'pushed', 'build', 'railroad', 'line', 'Burma-Siam', 'men', 'are', 'midst', 'dispossession', 'Japanese', 'brutality', 'seek', 'survive', 'self-respect', 'unflinching', 'humanity', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'should', 'have', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'American', 'who', 'British', 'mode', 'holding', 'stiff', 'upper', 'lip', 'one', 'should', 'just', 'do', 'duty', 'End', 'Wars', 'true', 'story', 'POW', 'Ernest', 'Gordon', 'movie', 'accurate', 'history', 'presentation', 'unlawful', 'viciousness', 'atrocities', 'Japanese', 'bad', 'language', 'R', 'rating', 'story', 'therein', '.This', 'not', 'just', 'anti-war', 'flick', 'Japan', 'war', 'cruelties', 'story', 'truth', 'redemption', 'forgiveness', 'human', 'dignity', 'can', 'be', 'maintained', 'displayed', 'even', 'midst', 'repression', 'revenge', 'war', 'despair', 'suffering.Buy', 'DVD', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'year', 'Memorial', 'Day', 'Veteran', 'Day', 'stirring', 'deeply', 'touching', 'faith', 'fortifying.There', 'Are', 'Moral', 'Absolutes', 'How', 'Be', 'Absolutely', 'Sure', 'Christianity', 'Alone', 'Supplies']",To End All Wars

820869,AW7BIYHXUIZ62,B00021R7BM,T.M. Reader,"[5, 5]","This is easily the best ""prisoner of war"" film I've ever seen.  Indeed, it's one of the best films produced this decade in any category.  To tag it as thought-provoking is an understatement (and when was the last time you watched a WWII POW camp flick that you would call thought-provoking?).The film is strongly based on the true story of the Allied prisoners that were used by Japan as slave labor to build the 400 km ""death railway"" from Thailand to Burma.  The conditions were intolerable and deadly.Some of the prisoners reponded to their lot with hatred and bitterness.  Some, and this is key to the film, sought out education and spiritual refreshment.  Plato, Shakespeare, music, the Bible, and ethics are taught and learned.  Oddly, neither Jesus nor the God of Christianity are ever specifically named, but the message regarding foregiveness, love and submission are overwhelmingly obvious to those familiar with the teachings of Jesus.  The film characters are transformed by this philosophy, including the captors to some degree.  This is not about religion, but rather how one lives one's life, especially under extreme adversity.  An additional note on the ""Jesus factor"" . . . the character Dusty, played so well by Mark Strong, parallels the nature and circumstances of the biblical Jesus so well that during one climactic scene I realized that I was leaning forward in my seat with my jaw hanging open.  Very, very powerful stuff (I won't give it away).Do not be scared off at this point thinking that this is one of those ""religious flicks"".  It is not.  It's fairly gritty and realistic with Academy Award quality acting, directing, and all other production values.  It is about war, hardship, duty and honor, good and evil, and cruelty and forgiveness, selfishness and self-sacrifice.  There are violent scenes but I did not consider them gratuitous. And, unusual for an R-rated flick, the production team did not cook up some reason to include a woman without her shirt on.  There is no nudity in the film (although after extended captivity, much of the POW clothing had become sparse rags).Finally, special mention to the location and set.  A very realistic look. As I mentioned above, all of the production values were top shelf.Thoughtful, intelligent, and certainly entertaining.
