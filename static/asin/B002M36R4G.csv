Obviously, there are questions of real cause and effect, insanity, reality, etc. The movie is generally well done, good production values, high image quality, etc., such that it feels high-ish budget (and that's a compliment). The mood throughout is creepy, and almost relentlessly so, never abating to anything else. The problem though, is that the film is never really scary.  Sequences occur in which I think the director intended to elicit a scare among the audience, but it fails to do so in every scene. Not sure exactly why, but the climactic build just didn't work, and I do scare fairly easily.

E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Dark Mirror is a pretty decent horror film but there's definitely several really unforgivably lackluster moments that prevent it from being more intense.  It's about a photographer that soon realizes every time she snaps a photo of somebody, they either disappear or become murdered.  Is it just a coincidence?Some of these events are unbelievable.  Her neighbor is a carefree exhibitionist?  What?  Her personality was just bizarre.  I had to laugh whenever the two women would have conversations because they were two VERY different women.  Anyway the exhibitionist woman probably isn't as bizarre as the photographer however- the photographer constantly has really horrible nightmares and visions involving bloody deaths, and the scene with the woman in the parking lot making severe threats towards the photographer for apparently hitting her car is another unusual piece of exaggerated writing that didn't quite make sense given its placement in the storyline (near the beginning).A tacky piece of writing comes near the beginning when the photographer and her mother are having an in-depth conversation about mirrors and that her house was apparently blessed for having protective mirrors.  Something about demons being drawn to mirrors, getting sucked in and not being able to escape.  This whole scene just destroyed the horror effect and brought forward an unforgivable degree of tackiness instead.  That's NOT what the writers were going for either but that's the way it came across.To make matters more confusing, the photographer woman apparently has delusional problems and sees things that aren't really happening (or sees images in the mirror- these are the scary parts).  Without spoiling some key moments, this would satisfyingly explain the awkwardness the first time she walks into the house and sees her mom in the kitchen.  The entire 10 minutes that ends the film is really spectacular and wraps up all the strange events nicely, and this is the *only* reason I'm giving the movie 4 stars.Overall, not a bad film but it has a few shortcomings.",4,the darkness of the mirrors,1346976000,"09 7, 2012",2012,2065,"['Dark', 'Mirror', 'pretty', 'decent', 'horror', 'film', 'definitely', 'several', 'really', 'unforgivably', 'lackluster', 'moments', 'prevent', 'being', 'more', 'intense', 'photographer', 'soon', 'time', 'photo', 'somebody', 'either', 'disappear', 'become', 'murdered', 'just', 'coincidence', 'events', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'neighbor', 'carefree', 'exhibitionist', 'What', 'personality', 'was', 'just', 'bizarre', 'had', 'laugh', 'whenever', 'two', 'women', 'would', 'have', 'conversations', 'were', 'two', 'VERY', 'different', 'women', 'Anyway', 'exhibitionist', 'woman', 'probably', ""n't"", 'as', 'bizarre', 'photographer', 'however-', 'photographer', 'constantly', 'really', 'horrible', 'nightmares', 'visions', 'involving', 'bloody', 'deaths', 'scene', 'woman', 'parking', 'lot', 'making', 'severe', 'threats', 'towards', 'photographer', 'apparently', 'hitting', 'car', 'unusual', 'piece', 'exaggerated', 'writing', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'sense', 'given', 'placement', 'storyline', 'beginning', 'tacky', 'piece', 'writing', 'beginning', 'when', 'photographer', 'mother', 'are', 'having', 'in-depth', 'conversation', 'mirrors', 'house', 'was', 'apparently', 'blessed', 'having', 'protective', 'mirrors', 'Something', 'demons', 'being', 'drawn', 'mirrors', 'getting', 'sucked', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'escape', 'whole', 'scene', 'just', 'destroyed', 'horror', 'effect', 'brought', 'forward', 'unforgivable', 'degree', 'tackiness', 'instead', 'NOT', 'what', 'writers', 'were', 'going', 'way', 'came', 'across.To', 'make', 'matters', 'more', 'confusing', 'photographer', 'woman', 'apparently', 'delusional', 'problems', 'sees', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'happening', 'images', 'mirror-', 'are', 'scary', 'parts', 'spoiling', 'key', 'moments', 'would', 'satisfyingly', 'explain', 'awkwardness', 'first', 'time', 'house', 'mom', 'kitchen', 'entire', '10', 'minutes', 'film', 'really', 'spectacular', 'up', 'strange', 'events', 'nicely', '*only*', 'reason', ""'m"", 'giving', 'movie', '4', 'stars.Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'few', 'shortcomings']",Dark Mirror
1277596,A120GIT50UISJP,B002M36R4G,"Channel KDK12 ""Channel KDK12 - Serious Horror""","[1, 1]","If you enjoy Asian horror, and are tired of endless Americanized remakes of Asian films, I think you'll really enjoy Dark Mirror. It's an American (indie) film, but it has all the elements of a good Asian ghost story--there is a quiet, slow build-up of darkness and dread, a wrathful ghost who metes out punishment to all who enter her domain, and a blurring of the lines between reality and imagination that makes us question what really happened to the very end.A new home in a new city promises a new start for photographer Deborah Martin, who longs to escape from being a homemaker and return to her artistic career. Fitting then, that she has moved into the home of a famous painter, Rupert Wells and his wife, Eleanor. But the painter and his family went mysteriously missing, and one by one, the neighbors are going missing, too. Deborah is convinced that the disappearances are tied to her home, which has strange passageways and hidden clues. Unless she can decipher the puzzle and learn the true fate of the painter's family, she and her husband [James Chisum] and son [Joshua Pelegrin] may face the same fate.Dark Mirror works on several levels, creating an disturbing atmosphere and intriguing puzzles. There is the story of Deborah, and her struggle to find herself again, to regain her identity as an artist. There is the parallel between Eleanor and Deborah, and the effect it has on Deborah's mind. And there is the puzzle of the house, and the secrets that Rupert and Eleanor hid within its walls and its otherworldly recesses. Good acting and effective pacing enhance the storyline, drawing us in and building in us the same curiosity and dread that Deborah experiences. Overall, Dark Mirror is a refreshing addition to the horror genre, especially in this era of remakes and sequels; it is nice to see that someone can draw upon the themes and styles of foreign horror and do more than create yet another unnecessary remake.",4,An indie movie with Asian horror touches,1299801600,"03 11, 2011",2011,1943,"['enjoy', 'Asian', 'horror', 'are', 'tired', 'endless', 'Americanized', 'remakes', 'Asian', 'films', 'think', ""'ll"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'Dark', 'Mirror', 'American', 'indie', 'film', 'elements', 'good', 'Asian', 'ghost', 'story', 'quiet', 'slow', 'build-up', 'darkness', 'dread', 'wrathful', 'ghost', 'who', 'out', 'punishment', 'who', 'enter', 'domain', 'blurring', 'lines', 'reality', 'imagination', 'question', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'very', 'end.A', 'new', 'home', 'new', 'city', 'new', 'start', 'photographer', 'Deborah', 'Martin', 'who', 'escape', 'being', 'homemaker', 'return', 'artistic', 'career', 'Fitting', 'then', 'moved', 'home', 'famous', 'painter', 'Rupert', 'Wells', 'wife', 'Eleanor', 'painter', 'family', 'went', 'mysteriously', 'missing', 'one', 'one', 'neighbors', 'are', 'going', 'missing', 'too', 'Deborah', 'convinced', 'disappearances', 'are', 'tied', 'home', 'strange', 'passageways', 'hidden', 'clues', 'can', 'decipher', 'puzzle', 'learn', 'true', 'fate', 'painter', 'family', 'husband', '[', 'James', 'Chisum', ']', 'son', '[', 'Joshua', 'Pelegrin', ']', 'may', 'face', 'same', 'fate.Dark', 'Mirror', 'several', 'levels', 'creating', 'disturbing', 'atmosphere', 'intriguing', 'puzzles', 'story', 'Deborah', 'struggle', 'find', 'again', 'regain', 'identity', 'artist', 'parallel', 'Eleanor', 'Deborah', 'effect', 'Deborah', 'mind', 'puzzle', 'house', 'secrets', 'Rupert', 'Eleanor', 'hid', 'walls', 'otherworldly', 'recesses', 'Good', 'acting', 'effective', 'pacing', 'enhance', 'storyline', 'drawing', 'building', 'same', 'curiosity', 'dread', 'Deborah', 'experiences', 'Overall', 'Dark', 'Mirror', 'refreshing', 'addition', 'horror', 'genre', 'especially', 'era', 'remakes', 'sequels', 'nice', 'see', 'someone', 'can', 'draw', 'themes', 'styles', 'foreign', 'horror', 'do', 'more', 'create', 'yet', 'unnecessary', 'remake']",Dark Mirror

And I readily admit that this is not nearly as bad a movie as that would make it out to be; it's paling in comparison to the company it's been keeping on my retinas. It's not the worst movie I watched that weekend, even (that would be the execrable 2008 remake of It's Alive), but it's derivative, badly-acted and -directed and all-around silly. You deserve better than this. Give me a few and I'll tell you how you can get it.Deborah Martin (Star Trek's Lisa Vidal) is a former photographer who gave up her career to get married and start a family. The batch of them, Deborah, husband Jim (Flight of the Living Dead's David Chisum), and son Ian (Joshua Pelegrin in his first and, to date, last big-screen role), are moving out to the country to get away from it all. They look at an endless succession of houses, but there's one that they step into, and immediately Deborah is taken with it. (You've heard this before, right?) After dithering on so many other houses, when she says ""we'll take it"", Jim is thrilled he can finally stop looking at houses, and they do. Deborah soon learns that the house was originally inhabited by a reclusive, possibly crazy, painter who may or may not have killed his entire family and hidden them somewhere in the house. More importantly, their spirits may be trapped in the house's mirrors. (You've heard this before, right?)It gets better. The big twist ending has been done to death. In fact, the movie is often compared, and never favorably, to a classic flick that has the same twist ending. It's also been done more recently in two excellent movies, and I'm not even considering the genre classic that started it all, and the almost-as-excellent homage to it that came out thirty years later. (I'm avoiding names in order to avoid spoilers; if you want to know the films I'm talking about, they'll be at the bottom of the review after spoiler space.) As well as, naturally, any number of dozens of movies that have tried it and failed miserably. This is only one of a huge crop. It doesn't help that few of the actors in this movie are any good, and those who are are relegated to stereotype roles at best (Lupe Ontiveros is the most visible member of this cast in that regard). Writer/director Pablo Proenza was working on his first feature-length movie. He's not an awful director, and maybe if he'd had some original material and a few decent actors to work with, he might have come up with something worthwhile. This ain't it. **POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOWFor the record, and if this roster doesn't give away the twist ending, then I can't help you.""In fact, the movie is often compared, and never favorably, to a classic flick that has the same twist ending.""

She was overreacting and it did not seem realistic at all in my opinion. Some scenes were fake looking and others were just silly. I was really interested in the people she took pictures of ending up missing, but in the end there is not really an adequate reason as to why this happened.The main character was very annoying, and frankly, just acted stupid throughout the movie. I got the feeling they were trying to make it into this situation where we are caught up in the main character's confusion and identifying with her, but I found it hard to do that because I was distracted by her annoying actions. She finds a painting of what looks like a dead naked woman and what does she do? Hangs it on the wall. I am also a little sick of movies portraying women main characters as having a son that she is very attached to (what is with this?The Ring,Wes Craven's New Nightmare,Double Jeopardy, just to name a few). Not to mention the whole ""evil ghost"" thing. It is interesting to watch but it is certainly not one of the better thrillers out there.",3,Somewhat suspensful but very cheesy,1312416000,"08 4, 2011",2011,1706,"['were', 'scenes', 'were', 'done', 'well', 'enough', 'definitely', 'suspenseful', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'scenes', 'are', 'poorly', 'done', 'just', 'plain', 'annoying', 'cheesy', 'mystery', 'house', 'history', 'house', 'windows', 'caped', 'person', 'were', 'better', 'aspects', 'film.Some', 'scenes', 'were', 'overdone', 'such', 'scene', 'where', 'woman', 'banging', 'window', 'are', 'obviously', 'trying', 'put', 'focus', 'main', 'character', 'confusion', 'having', 'woman', 'banging', 'window', 'background', 'kept', 'thinking', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'was', 'so', 'stupid', 'was', 'banging', 'window', 'was', 'overreacting', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'realistic', 'opinion', 'scenes', 'were', 'fake', 'looking', 'others', 'were', 'just', 'silly', 'was', 'really', 'interested', 'people', 'took', 'pictures', 'ending', 'up', 'missing', 'end', 'not', 'really', 'adequate', 'reason', 'why', 'happened.The', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'annoying', 'frankly', 'just', 'acted', 'stupid', 'movie', 'got', 'feeling', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'situation', 'where', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'main', 'character', 'confusion', 'identifying', 'found', 'hard', 'do', 'was', 'distracted', 'annoying', 'actions', 'painting', 'what', 'dead', 'naked', 'woman', 'what', 'do', 'Hangs', 'wall', 'am', 'also', 'little', 'sick', 'movies', 'portraying', 'women', 'main', 'characters', 'having', 'son', 'very', 'attached', 'what', 'Ring', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'New', 'Nightmare', 'Double', 'Jeopardy', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'Not', 'mention', 'whole', 'evil', 'ghost', 'thing', 'interesting', 'watch', 'certainly', 'not', 'one', 'better', 'thrillers', 'there']",Dark Mirror

The setting is a bit constricted (reflecting budget constraints no doubt) while the characters are pretty shallow and although ""Dark Mirror"" does have some suspenseful moments any hope for true horror gets bogged down in the overarching theme of ""what's really going on here.... do you think you know.... ahhhhh....  you only think you know muahahaha!"".The whole Mindbender thing might've worked with some bigger-name actors and a larger budget (throw in a less generic score while you're at it) but as it is this one is decidedly meh.
