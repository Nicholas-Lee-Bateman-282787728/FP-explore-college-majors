On the other hand, it was absolutely ridiculous and stupid.Lets face it. There are two kinds of Directors in this world. Directors who look at a big name studio film and go ""I like it,"" and Directors who look at a big name studio film and go ""I'll steal it,"" and then burst out laughing.The Lost Tribe (2009) is a heist of Predator (1987).  It is a dumb, boring prehistoric ""Creature Feature"" that wears out its welcome long before it ends.  Predator meets The Ape (1940) meets Island of Dr. Moreau (1977) meets dissatisfactory dialogue, Directing, and script.Five yacht-wrecked friends are preyed upon by mysterious, faceless ape beings with obscure motives on a deserted island.  The actors do a good job but the material is just crap.  The Lost Tribe can't be called a horror movie because it would only scare small children.The Lost Tribe is decently made but so tired and pointless.

I suppose I should begin at the beginning.  I have a meeting to catch at a very specific time, any minor delay will cost me millions of dollars, I think I will travel there by boat, said no one ever outside of this movie.  That is the premise it starts you out with after attempting to show you that these 5 friends are the happiest they will ever be in their lives.  Awe, how touching.  Then they run across a mysterious stranger whom the coast guard identifies as a possible criminal, but of course because we can't have a few hours delay in our multi-day boat trip they decide to just keep the guy with them while they journey on,  The man who is in fear for his life told them to turn around (presumably that they need to get help), not surprisingly he escapes and the dying man crashes the boat (navigation free by the way) onto the very island he was supposedly running from (even though the fact that they had a charted course and were obviously not involved with his island escapades he would have been safe regardless, his re-directing the boat made no sense in any sense of the word),Boom! So they crash.  Why did the boat crash they ask?  Must have been a solar flare.  Sounds totally plausible, lets go with it.Now, that we are all trapped on an island let us explore it somewhat, and we find the abandon pseudo military base, filled with supplies and equipment.  People may come back to it.  I know, lets go back to the beach.  Better yet, lets go back to the beach and not take any of the supplies or equipment.  After all, it would be rude, someone with a boat or aircraft may want to make a hasty retreat and we would hate to do anything that gives us shelter or lets other people know that there is someone else on the island.Back on the beach. Oops SO says that you fell asleep on guard and the crazy stranger crashed the boat.  Why did you lie?  &#34;I said it to save time&#34;..  Yes, they actually say that in the movie.  I lied to save time. By time of course you mean face.  Let's fight about it!  Make any kind of a signal?  Nay, the crappy radio transmission will do just fine.And middle of the night we hear a sound, I know I am going to go exploring by myself.  Oops.Next day, OMFG someone is missing, lets wander through the jungle trying to find them.  Find a body ripped to pieces see unknown creatures following you in the trees.  Let's split up!  Next 10 minutes 2 more (essentially) die.  Find a research base!  Bonus! Lets see what is on the computer, it will probably matter to us more than weapons, supplies, or communication devices.Cue crazy priest who kills one of the obviously not associated with whatever else he has going on shipwrecked people and prepares to execute the other one.  Fails and dies.  Why did he attack in the first place?  Because the information on this island was the one last piece of evidence that was needed to make it so no one would ever believe in god again.  Yep, all of the faithful including the zealots would instantly have an epiphany that god does not exist if this information was to leave this island (of course the church already knew this was the case and have just been using god as a control mechanism for centuries).  Right on!Now it is just hero chick, and taking a cue from predator, she gets all muddy and goopy and the underevolved hominids can't see her.  But it wasn't the mud it was the smelly goop from the funky grapes.  See, the pinball wizard was a member of the lost tribe, he saw by sense of smell as well!  And even though they can still see her moving and hear her clearly they don't attack because she isn't glowing, obviously a piece of the jungle.What is a heroine to do?  Lets goop up without a plan and go deep into the monsters lair!  Yeah!  And then light a glowstick, and even after a close call with one, lets light another one!  The monsters are also keenly tuned to the sound of dripping which in a damp cave obviously means an intruder, though scuttling and shifting of rocks does not.  Dying boyfriend (even though they kill other people on the quick, he needed to be saved for later), engagement ring, apology, dead boyfriend.And cue movie dragging on for a while longer, final confrontation with the leader whom, even though she is a different species, wants to get it on with her ( I suppose it makes sense as they didn't appear to have any females).  Obvious plot point of dropped machete which she stabs into the leader in a dramatic way showing her dominance and all of the others leave her alone.  Can't wait for the rescue, crappy raft, and cue credits..Sadly I made that sound better than it actually was.

I avoid heavy gore movies, so this one is very tame in comparison to others out there.  If you're looking for a lot of slice and dice, blood and guts, this is not the movie for you.As prior reviews stated, there are distinct similarities to Predator...alien critters that like to kill humans, running through a jungle, hiding, etc.  I enjoyed Emily Foxler's performance throughout the movie considering she spent the majority of the movie alone in a jungle with crazy monkey aliens.I did not care for the ending of the movie, it was open ended, I enjoy having closure and knowing what happens to the main character.

Don't watch the trailer for a sense of the movie, because the trailer on here is just the first few minutes of the movie. And the description is a bit misleading. This movie is about an island (that is uncharted because I don't think it really exists, but only in the past maybe, when this &#34;lost tribe&#34; lived) that only exists, pretty much, on a different plane/dimension. The only way I could make sense of the premise of this movie was to assume that all the characters died when the boat sank (at the beginning of the movie), and this island they wash ashore on was a kind of limbo where they could die a gruesome, horrible death at the hands of their evolutionary ancestors.If you can refrain from thinking about this movie too much afterwards, or during really, it can be enjoyable at times, if you are one to enjoy horror/thriller flicks. If you only watch the first few minutes, you're not going to like anything you see, because it does get a bit better.

I 'm getting good at feeling out a film by the title alone plus the image on the DVD cover so I knew it was likely a weak horror. Afterwards the film was smart enough to let my imagination do the work whilst they were being stalked.Mainly my imagination was spoofing out on the parallells that despite being evolved homo-sapiens,  some people,  in our times, actually bother to indulge in producing shallow crap like this film and it is somehow considered normal behaviour. But then being shown ads every ten minutes on TV and the content of ads themselves is mind-boggling considering "" our intelligence ""and technological feats. Animals are far more sraight forward (if not primitive people )  to find this product of technological sophistication unwatchable because it is boring and stupid; wierdly so.Nevertheless this film,  and many others like it,  are out on the market-place as viable if not contenders raking in a meagre profit.I spent most of the film with my eyes screwed up againt the bright sun of deep time and evolution and that here's an example of the proof we may be doomed for extinction..( Let alone the God thang and the dedication To My Teachers as the credits start to roll :10 names; half of them Indian, ending with The Great One....)On the other hand, bad can be so bad it is funny. I began to wonder if the makers of the film were not having a larf and making fools out of anyone being leery or lapping it up. I mean,  when the lost tribesman first feasts on one of the crew,  the sound he makes is "" Mhow-wer"". Yes- more!!. Like-wise, when he touches up the human female, he lustily makes a sound like "" Mah Ghash""-  my gosh!To its credit, the one redeeming feature of this film is not a stupid ending.

Later we find out that it is supposed to be the ""missing link"" in human evolution.  The writers have evidently had little to no experience to any field related to evolution, or have bothered to read any number of the great books detailing human evolution or they'd know that there aren't any ""missing links"".  A field researcher later remarks that this proves that ""God did not create man"".  It doesn't, it just proves that humans weren't created as we are, but have evolved.  Two glaring errors so far.The side antagonist, only making a brief appearance and led by Lance Hendrickson, is ""The Church"".  They can't let word of this transitional species out, so they hire hit-men to go and exterminate the anthropologists.  Never mind that in real life, ""The Church"" has fully accepted, and encourages its followers to accept, evolution by natural selection as a scientific fact.Some pretty protagonists manage to get themselves caught in between the idiot field workers and immoral hit-men, and I'm sure you've seen the rest in every other monster movie since Alien.  The plot is wafer thin, the pacing is terribly boring and the premise manages to be less believable than something like Friday the 13th by intentionally mangling reality (imagine a movie predicated on the idea that someone has discovered that the Earth is round and revolves around the sun - kinda stoopid, ya?).  The camera angles were pretty well done and I never got tired of looking at the movie.  The acting, surprisingly, was good for the most part, especially in the leads.

An archeological dig that consists of a single 3'x4' rectangle that is about 6"" deep and happens to have a skull sitting upright right in the middle just doesn't happen. Ancient Hominid creatures that suddenly jump 50' straight up - no way. Having a visual system that was suppose to be IR like that looked more like UV but failed miserably at whatever it was suppose to be. The writer/director has never heard of carrying capacity of a population for it to continue to exist. Over the period of time suggested and on an isolated island it would have to be thousands of individuals.Second, inconsistencies such as the sailboat first being shown in an expanse of ocean with no land nearby then within a few hours it's next to a group of large islands. It's sinking looked an awful lot like a toy sailboat that's several hundred feet beneath the surface and sinking fast but then the crew suddenly, in unison, pop up virtually on the beach. Strangely no animals are seen in the movie but our ancient Hominids look as if they feast every day.Third, how can any actor or film crew in good conscience participate in ripping off other movies?

Some of the concepts that were barely touched on would have made for a much more interesting film; but ultimately we just get a silly monsters movie that doesn't really go anywhere, doesn't really scare you and falls flat when its over. I did think it started strong, with stronger characters than your usual cast of misfit teens; this created a false hope for some depth. The story line about the researcher and those who would like to see her research fail could have been a much better movie. And why did these creatures have any similarity to the Predator?

What possesses a guy who has racked up credits in films as wonderful as &lt;em>The Terminator&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Aliens&lt;/em> to find himself playing a killer priest in &lt;em>The Lost Tribe&lt;/em>, a movie I can only describe as the world's first (and please god let it be the world's last) new-age Buddhist Neanderthal slasher film? Dutch director Rein&eacute; and debut screenwriter Mark E. Davidson conspired to make something very awful indeed, and judging by the rest of the film, they spent roughly 95% of their budget convincing Lance Henriksen he really, really needed the money. (While this may be the spoiler to end all spoilers, I will tell you right now that if you're watching this movie out of a misplaced sense of Henriksen man-crush, as I did, you're not going to get your money's worth; he's got all of five minutes of screen time.)Plot: a pleasure yacht on its way to Malaysia discovers a man (an uncredited Caleb Campbell, recently of &lt;em>G. I. Joe: The Rise of C.O.B.R.A.&lt;/em.) thrashing around in the middle of the ocean, clearly having been driven mad by... something (cue eerie music). Soon after, their ship crashes, and the batch of them wash up on shore. (In one of the movie's most amusing moments, they're talking to a potential rescue crew on their rapidly-dying radio, and one of them says their last known location is ""about five hours north of the Antilles"". Depending on what part of the Antilles, that would have put them in the Gulf of Mexico, the Bermuda Triangle, or in southern Florida... halfway around the world from Malaysia.) We have Tom (&lt;em>My Little Eye&lt;/em>'s Nick Mennell), a computer whiz who's startup idea is about to go huge, and his girlfriend Anna (&lt;em>Grizzly Park&lt;/em> beauty Emily Foxler, once again the best thing about a movie she stars in); his partner Chris (musical theatre vet Hadley Fraser in his frist feature film), and Joe (Marc Bacher... whose most notable role was in &lt;em>The Tribe&lt;/em>, the movie of which this is a remake!) and his new-age guru wife Alexis (&lt;em>The 40-Year-Old Virgin&lt;/em>'s Brianna Brown). Crazy chap died in the wreck, so they bury him in the sand, and Tom, citing a desire to be alone for a while, wanders off into the jungle. Soon after, crazy chap's body disappears, and they figure they'd best go look for Tom in case whatever took said body also likes its meat live...Aside from the Antilles silliness, the movie also contains one of the awesome hallmarks of crappy films everywhere--a continuity error so glaring that even the least observant of viewers is going to pick it out. (One of the characters, previously covered in mud, shows up in the next shot clean and perfectly coiffed.) But these are only symptoms of the systematic ineptness to be found here; it's terribly-written, terribly-acted, and features monsters (said Lost Tribe) so ripped off from another movie you'll wonder how these guys didn't get sued. The dedication at the end (which seems to be an apologia for all the movie's new-age and Buddhist trappings) just puts the cherry on top of this mess. Add in the killer-priest ""subplot"", which gets so little screen time it should have been scrapped altogether, and a patently offensive attempted-rape scene and I can't imagine anyone actually enjoying this claptrap.

This movie was so bad (how bad was it Bob???) it gets the Holy Cow award for badness.  The protagonists (or should I say, hedonists) are completely unsympathetic--and completely boneheaded for taking their eyes off of a suspicious character they pick up from the sea who proceeds to regain consciousness in the middle of the night, go completely coo-coo and run the yacht aground.  And if this doesn't make you say Holy Cow, just you watch those last 30 minutes of the film.  What the HELL makes a person go in the middle of the night to an elaborate cave system, where they know an entire tribe of cannibals---fanged cannibals---is living and then go explore it??

In this case, instead of a lone alien from another world, the threat comes from a group of strange creatures a few steps below man on the evolutionary ladder.  Like the Predator, these beings seem to see in infrared, have dreadlocks, and can be almost invisible in the jungle.  Fortunately for those in danger, the creatures are not technologically advanced, or the film might be much shorter.Joe (Marc Bacher) his girlfriend Alexis (Brianna Brown) and three friends are aboard a boat somewhere in the south Pacific, headed for a resort to close a business deal, when they pick up a man adrift at sea.  That night, while everyone else is asleep, the stranger steers the boat onto a reef, sending it to the bottom.  The survivors escape and struggle ashore on a nearby island.  They manage to recover their radio transmitter, and contact someone to request help, but it may be some time before anyone arrives.The group of three men and two women begin exploring, and discover the body of the man they rescued.  Poking around some more, they find a deserted campsite, and a tent with a cache of weapons, but apparently no food.  Rather than using the available camp, firing the guns to draw the attention of anyone in the area, or searching for other inhabitants, the group returns to the beach.  Clearly not the brightest people around.That night, Tom (Nick Mennell) hears a noise, wanders into a brightly lighted jungle, and is attacked and taken.  The next day, his girlfriend Anna (Emily Foxler) and the rest of the group search for him, and begin to see some really strange things in the jungle.  Anna and Joe find a house, which contains evidence that a missing link between ancient and modern man, once lived on the island.  The members of this so called ""lost tribe"", kind of resemble the Predator alien, in size and general shape, but minus any armor or technological enhancements, except a mask.Of course the tribe is far from extinct, and in a killing mood.  Before long, Anna is the last survivor running free.  As in Predator, being covered in mud seems to act as a cloaking measure.  Escaping detection, Anna witnesses a friend being killed and eaten by the tribe.  Anna discovers more survivors in a cave, and makes a fateful and dramatic choice.  She is then tracked down by the pack, and brutalized and assaulted by the tribe's leader.  This is pretty tense and dramatic, but the movie's conclusion lacks believability.The special effects and the monster suits are not too bad, but again many of the scenes may seem very familiar if you have seen Predator.  The screenplay sets up most of the cast as clueless victims sprouting inane dialog, but most do what they can with the material.  Lance Henrikson appears briefly, before making a dramatic exit.  Even covered in mud, Emily Foxler looks pretty good, and gives a nice performance as the last girl, going from mudsoaked to clean, to goo covered, and back to clean again.Besides the rather shameless rip-off of Predator, much too much seems to tread on very familiar ground, except for a dubious element concerning the Catholic church trying to cover up evidence of evolution.  Heavily derivative, The Lost Tribe not may be more enjoyable if you have not seen Predator for a while.  Directed by Roel Reine (Death Race 2, Pistol Whipped), the film has decent production values, and some suspenseful moments, along with some ridiculous ones, as not a lot that happens makes much sense at all.",3,"a clearly derivative, bungle in the jungle with deadly creatures...",1317254400,"09 29, 2011",2011,3663,"['jungle', 'cannibal', 'story', 'sci-fi', 'classicPredator', 'Widescreen', 'Collector', 'Edition', '1987', 'might', 'get', 'something', 'Lost', 'Tribe', '2010', 'film', 'heavily', 'source', 'case', 'instead', 'lone', 'alien', 'world', 'threat', 'group', 'strange', 'creatures', 'few', 'steps', 'man', 'evolutionary', 'ladder', 'Predator', 'beings', 'seem', 'see', 'infrared', 'have', 'dreadlocks', 'can', 'be', 'almost', 'invisible', 'jungle', 'Fortunately', 'danger', 'creatures', 'are', 'not', 'technologically', 'advanced', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'much', 'shorter.Joe', 'Marc', 'Bacher', 'girlfriend', 'Alexis', 'Brianna', 'Brown', 'three', 'friends', 'are', 'boat', 'somewhere', 'south', 'Pacific', 'headed', 'resort', 'close', 'business', 'deal', 'when', 'pick', 'up', 'man', 'adrift', 'sea', 'night', 'everyone', 'else', 'asleep', 'stranger', 'boat', 'reef', 'sending', 'bottom', 'survivors', 'escape', 'struggle', 'ashore', 'nearby', 'island', 'manage', 'recover', 'radio', 'transmitter', 'contact', 'someone', 'request', 'help', 'may', 'be', 'time', 'anyone', 'arrives.The', 'group', 'three', 'men', 'two', 'women', 'begin', 'exploring', 'discover', 'body', 'man', 'rescued', 'Poking', 'more', 'find', 'deserted', 'campsite', 'tent', 'cache', 'weapons', 'apparently', 'food', 'Rather', 'using', 'available', 'camp', 'firing', 'guns', 'draw', 'attention', 'anyone', 'area', 'searching', 'other', 'inhabitants', 'group', 'beach', 'Clearly', 'not', 'brightest', 'people', 'around.That', 'night', 'Tom', 'Nick', 'Mennell', 'noise', 'wanders', 'brightly', 'lighted', 'jungle', 'attacked', 'taken', 'next', 'day', 'girlfriend', 'Anna', 'Emily', 'Foxler', 'rest', 'group', 'search', 'begin', 'see', 'really', 'strange', 'things', 'jungle', 'Anna', 'Joe', 'find', 'house', 'evidence', 'missing', 'link', 'ancient', 'modern', 'man', 'once', 'lived', 'island', 'members', 'so', 'called', 'lost', 'tribe', 'kind', 'resemble', 'Predator', 'alien', 'size', 'general', 'shape', 'armor', 'technological', 'enhancements', 'mask.Of', 'course', 'tribe', 'far', 'extinct', 'killing', 'mood', 'long', 'Anna', 'last', 'survivor', 'running', 'free', 'Predator', 'being', 'covered', 'mud', 'act', 'cloaking', 'measure', 'Escaping', 'detection', 'Anna', 'friend', 'being', 'killed', 'eaten', 'tribe', 'Anna', 'more', 'survivors', 'cave', 'fateful', 'dramatic', 'choice', 'then', 'tracked', 'down', 'pack', 'brutalized', 'assaulted', 'tribe', 'leader', 'pretty', 'tense', 'dramatic', 'movie', 'conclusion', 'believability.The', 'special', 'effects', 'monster', 'suits', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'again', 'many', 'scenes', 'may', 'seem', 'very', 'familiar', 'have', 'seen', 'Predator', 'screenplay', 'up', 'most', 'cast', 'clueless', 'victims', 'sprouting', 'inane', 'dialog', 'most', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'material', 'Lance', 'Henrikson', 'briefly', 'making', 'dramatic', 'exit', 'Even', 'covered', 'mud', 'Emily', 'Foxler', 'pretty', 'good', 'nice', 'performance', 'last', 'girl', 'going', 'mudsoaked', 'clean', 'goo', 'covered', 'back', 'clean', 'rather', 'shameless', 'rip-off', 'Predator', 'much', 'too', 'much', 'tread', 'very', 'familiar', 'ground', 'dubious', 'element', 'concerning', 'Catholic', 'church', 'trying', 'cover', 'up', 'evidence', 'evolution', 'Heavily', 'derivative', 'Lost', 'Tribe', 'not', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Predator', 'while', 'Directed', 'Roel', 'Reine', 'Death', 'Race', '2', 'Pistol', 'Whipped', 'film', 'decent', 'production', 'values', 'suspenseful', 'moments', 'ridiculous', 'ones', 'not', 'lot', 'much', 'sense']",The Lost Tribe

1376255,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B003YDZV72,Wuchak,"[1, 1]","Released in 2010, ""The Lost Tribe"" tells the story of a group of five people who become shipwrecked. The island they wash-up on shows signs of an abandoned archeological dig and a mysterious pack of primordial ape-men.There's also an interesting subplot concerning evidence of the missing link found at the dig site and the Roman Church sending a hitman (Lance Hendriksen) to terminate the evidence, including the scientists. Yet don't let this keep you from seeing the film if you find Darwin's theory dubious because, in the story, it's never proven that the ape-like creatures ARE the missing link. They could just as well be a previously undiscovered species of ape, like gorillas.I was surprised at how well-made the film is, particularly after reading all the negative reviews. Although this may be a low-budget flick, it's clear that filmmakers are total professionals. The photography, score, actors, locations, editing, F/X, gore, etc. are all excellent (not that I care about gore, but gorehounds will want to know).Unfortunately, there are some problems that force my rating down. First of all, there are the blatant rip-offs from ""Predator."" Just look at the DVD cover for proof. However, even though the film steals quite a few elements of ""Predator,"" there are enough differences that make it distinct. For instance, the beasts aren't aliens, there are no commandos, the story revolves around a group of castaways, and the main protagonist is a woman.Speaking of women, the film should be commended for including the beautiful Brianna Brown as one of the castaways. This provides the perfect opportunity to have Brianna prance around in some alluring island attire, sorta like cutie Beth Rogan in the original ""Mysterious Island (Widescreen)"" and a couple of the actresses in ""Turistas (Unrated Edition)."" Unfortunately, the filmmakers have Brianna dressed in one of those long skirts that women put over their bikinis. So we have this gorgeous, shapely woman and they dress her in a floor-length skirt during the entire island sequence of the movie? Absurd.Another problem is that there's not much depth to the characters and the story beyond the deep love of two main characters and the sometimes-moving music. Still, that's more depth than films like ""Anaconda 3: Offspring,"" lol.The film runs 100 minutes and was shot in Panama.FINAL WORD: ""The Lost Tribe"" is professionally made and mixes together elements of ""Predator,"" ""Touristas,"" ""Dead Calm"" and ""The Descent."" The ape creatures are excellently done and totally brutal, but the film borrows a little too heavily from ""Predator."" Plus there's not much depth beyond the love story and moving music, which makes for a strangely uncompelling watch. Still, it's well worth your while if you're into these kinds of movies.GRADE: Borderline C+/B-",3,"Very well-made, but has some problems",1355011200,"12 9, 2012",2012,2813,"['Released', '2010', 'Lost', 'Tribe', 'story', 'group', 'five', 'people', 'who', 'become', 'shipwrecked', 'island', 'wash-up', 'shows', 'signs', 'abandoned', 'archeological', 'dig', 'mysterious', 'pack', 'primordial', 'ape-men.There', 'also', 'interesting', 'subplot', 'concerning', 'evidence', 'missing', 'link', 'found', 'dig', 'site', 'Roman', 'Church', 'sending', 'hitman', 'Lance', 'Hendriksen', 'terminate', 'evidence', 'including', 'scientists', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'keep', 'seeing', 'film', 'find', 'Darwin', 'theory', 'dubious', 'because', 'story', 'never', 'proven', 'ape-like', 'creatures', 'ARE', 'missing', 'link', 'could', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'previously', 'undiscovered', 'species', 'ape', 'gorillas.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'well-made', 'film', 'particularly', 'reading', 'negative', 'reviews', 'may', 'be', 'low-budget', 'flick', 'clear', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'total', 'professionals', 'photography', 'score', 'actors', 'locations', 'editing', 'F/X', 'gore', 'etc', 'are', 'excellent', 'not', 'care', 'gore', 'gorehounds', 'will', 'want', 'know', '.Unfortunately', 'are', 'problems', 'force', 'rating', 'down', 'First', 'all', 'are', 'blatant', 'rip-offs', 'Predator', 'Just', 'look', 'DVD', 'cover', 'proof', 'However', 'even', 'film', 'steals', 'quite', 'few', 'elements', 'Predator', 'are', 'enough', 'differences', 'make', 'distinct', 'instance', 'beasts', 'are', ""n't"", 'aliens', 'are', 'commandos', 'story', 'group', 'castaways', 'main', 'protagonist', 'woman.Speaking', 'women', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'including', 'beautiful', 'Brianna', 'Brown', 'one', 'castaways', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'have', 'Brianna', 'prance', 'around', 'alluring', 'island', 'attire', 'sorta', 'cutie', 'Beth', 'Rogan', 'original', 'Mysterious', 'Island', 'Widescreen', 'couple', 'actresses', 'Turistas', 'Unrated', 'Edition', 'Unfortunately', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'Brianna', 'dressed', 'one', 'long', 'skirts', 'women', 'put', 'over', 'bikinis', 'have', 'gorgeous', 'shapely', 'woman', 'dress', 'floor-length', 'skirt', 'entire', 'island', 'sequence', 'movie', 'problem', 'not', 'much', 'depth', 'characters', 'story', 'deep', 'love', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'sometimes-moving', 'music', 'Still', 'more', 'depth', 'films', 'Anaconda', '3', 'Offspring', 'lol.The', 'film', '100', 'minutes', 'was', 'shot', 'Panama.FINAL', 'WORD', 'Lost', 'Tribe', 'professionally', 'made', 'mixes', 'together', 'elements', 'Predator', 'Touristas', 'Dead', 'Calm', 'Descent', 'ape', 'creatures', 'are', 'excellently', 'done', 'totally', 'brutal', 'film', 'little', 'too', 'heavily', 'Predator', 'not', 'much', 'depth', 'love', 'story', 'moving', 'music', 'strangely', 'uncompelling', 'watch', 'Still', 'well', 'worth', ""'re"", 'kinds', 'movies.GRADE', 'Borderline', 'C+/B-']",The Lost Tribe
