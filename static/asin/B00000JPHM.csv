507218,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00000JPHM,D. Litton,"[8, 14]","It's inevitable that certain people will warm to the excessive bloodletting that makes up the majority of ""Kolobos,"" a movie so flat and inconceivably bad that the only truly frightening thing that comes to mind while viewing is that someone actually came up with this; this was someone's idea. The movie, being an independent film, over-emphasizes its gory violence and leaves its less-than-mediocre story, while introducing us to flat, uninvolving characters we have no time to get to know. It's this type of splatter flick which makes such films as ""Friday the 13th"" seem intelligent and frightening (and I'm no fan of that one, either).The opening does its best to be ominous in its approach to horror, and for a brief second, it seems as if the movie may have a glimmer of hope. A young man and woman in a Jeep stop in the middle of an alley to find a brutally mutilated girl lying in a pool of blood, murmuring the word ""kolobos."" I liked this sequence: we are never given a glimpse of the girl, therefore leading us to believe that the ""less-is-more"" approach will make this movie a success. The rest of the beginning also develops quite nicely, as the injured girl, Kyra, recalls the experiences which lead up to her scars.Kyra, along with four others, Tom, Erica, Gary and Tina, all respond to an ad in the paper which calls for five people willing to live in a secluded house whlie having their activities caught on video surveillance cameras throughout the property. They all seem to get along well, although some of Kyra's mysteriously grotesque drawings have some of them wondering about her (she also uses prescription drugs, which doesn't sit well with the group, either). So when the bodies begin to drop and they become sealed inside the booby-trapped house, their desperate attempt to escape leads them to accusations again one another and even more dead bodies.And that's really all the second half is composed of: mayhem and murder, without a moment of rest. There are scenes of violence and bodily harm that are so realistic looking and believable that they are seriously difficult to look at. Seriously. And since there is so much of it, there really is no room for anything else. The story keeps feeding us such images as rotating saw blades flying into flesh, a shower of pure acid, entrails and cut throats, which overwhelm us to the point of regurgitation. And believe me on this: you see everything, which betrays the movie's original approach of ""less-is-more.""The way I see it is that the filmmakers sought out to make all of this bloodshed the shock factor of the film, without any truly frightening scares. It does succeed in shocking us, yes, but in a totally different way. It was all I could do to finish this movie, because I hate leaving a movie in the middle, and the whole time, I'm wondering just what kind of minds could come up with the images displayed throughout this film.And to be honest, I should've left in the middle of the film, because the ending is the most confusing and ridiculous aspect of this unworthy story. Without giving too much away, there is much confusion about Kyra's involvement in the events that took place in that house, and you'll see what I mean in the very last sequence after her release from the hospital. Apparently everything did happen, but the movie makes it out to be one of those mind trips where no one believes her, and even the physical facts prove otherwise. And the movie nevers answers that question, nor does it leave a slight hint.The story itself is strictly juvenile, and like its characters, we never get a chance to get into it or get a feel for it. The gore is a turn-off, yes, but the story does everything it can to put its characters into inescapable situations which almost certainly will end in death. The characters are never developed: we are given some small insight into their backgrounds or present lives, but not enough to sustain any sort of emotion or feeling for them once they die. There seems to be a hint of a romance between Kyra and one of the others, but again, he is killed off so quickly that we don't care. I felt myself comparing my connection to this story to a connection between me and someone I've never even met who lives in another country on another planet in another galaxy... you get the picture.Actors have no place to exploit any sort of emotion, and even their performances are as flat as the script paper. Amy Weber hints at a performance that wants to burst out of her and be free, but the only thing escaping her lips are controlled sobs and scared puppy faces. Promise LeMarco comes off as totally annoying in the role of Tina: she is just too peppy and upbeat (by the way, she's the first to die). Donny Terranova is Tom, and John Fairlie is Gary, and while both of them try to portray the rough image of strong men, they come off as whimps. Nichole Pelerine plays Erica, the actress/.... who generates little fear in her performance.""Kolobos"" doesn't even give off the promise of good intentions, except for its video cover. It gives off the notion that it is intelligent and scary, when it is, in fact, the opposite. It is scary, but not in the ways intended. Be sure to have a barf bucket handy when watching this autopsy showcase, and don't expect much from the story or its characters.",1,Overly gory and full of bland characters and weak

I was gifted Kolobos for my birthday one year on VHS, I was young and didn't think it would be a good movie judging by the cover. Finally I gave in and watched it, needless to say I LOVED IT! Well after the VCR became inferrior to the DVD player my Kolobos was boxed up and put away. Years later I was spring cleaning and found it, memories came flooding back and that began my search for the DVD. Well I was just devastated when I heard it had been discontinued as a single DVD, I didnt want this master piece sharing a case and disc with something crappy. Thus my search for KOLOBOS on DVD began, months later I found this seller and my prayers was answered.

Weather you admire the solid actors making the best of a tight budget or a director knowing how ""camp"" his movie is and playing it out for fun. Sadly however there are B horror films that are made so badly that even for the absurdity of it, they are painful to watch even for lovers of the genre.Kolobos is probably one of the worst. The script is practically non existant and full of unanswered questions that even a C movie would have. A group of people spend the night in a house (why?) only to be killed off (because?) by a killer who does it for (reason?). The set is mostly the interior of a house that looks like the one down the street from you. Nothing big and scary..just your average, slightly large suburban house. While I do give some effort to the actors for at least trying, most of the performances are over acted and their lines are childishly written.So, how bad is it? Is it one of the worst? Probably. Notice how most of the actors NEVER did anything after this movie. One hit wonders. I wouldnt rent this even if I was curious. Check some of the ""good"" reviews and see how many other titles these people have written about. Suspicious? You bet.
