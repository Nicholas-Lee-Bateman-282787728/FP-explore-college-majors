1192185,A23FJSE5AMGISF,B001FSDP30,Charles Hall,"[5, 9]","This show attempts to do three things at once, be a biography of George Hale, explain astronomy, and document the creation of three large telescopes (Yerkes, Wilson, Palomar).Let's start with the bad news. The biography of Hale is so sketchy you'll be running to Wikipedia to make sense of it. It starts with Hale as a 12-yr old watching Chicago burn. In the next scene he's having his father build him a major observatory. Ummm, did he go to college somewhere? Was his father rich? No clues here. Later his wife appears for a quote or two but is otherwise ignored. He speaks fluently about the arts and Italian art to the wife of one of his backers... when did he have an interest in that? No clue here about that either.As for the second thread, the narration attempts to justify the creation of these ground-breaking new telescopes by giving very brief descriptions about what astronomers wanted them for. Unfortunately there's way too much 20-20 hindsight and these diversions make no sense either.The show's real strength is in the raw history of the telescopes themselves. They seem to have found a mother lode of wonderful photographs showing many under construction photos of the telescopes.So if you're interested in telescopes, this DVD is 5-stars. As entertainment, it's somewhat annoying due to the many gaps in the story line.",3,Great photographs and sketchy history,1233532800,"02 2, 2009",2009,1339,"['show', 'do', 'three', 'things', 'once', 'be', 'biography', 'George', 'Hale', 'explain', 'astronomy', 'document', 'creation', 'three', 'large', 'telescopes', 'Yerkes', 'Wilson', 'Palomar', '.Let', 'start', 'bad', 'news', 'biography', 'Hale', 'so', 'sketchy', ""'ll"", 'be', 'running', 'Wikipedia', 'make', 'sense', 'Hale', '12-yr', 'old', 'watching', 'Chicago', 'burn', 'next', 'scene', 'having', 'father', 'build', 'major', 'observatory', 'Ummm', 'did', 'go', 'college', 'somewhere', 'Was', 'father', 'rich', 'clues', 'here', 'Later', 'wife', 'quote', 'two', 'otherwise', 'ignored', 'fluently', 'arts', 'Italian', 'art', 'wife', 'one', 'backers', 'when', 'did', 'have', 'interest', 'clue', 'here', 'either.As', 'second', 'thread', 'narration', 'justify', 'creation', 'ground-breaking', 'new', 'telescopes', 'giving', 'very', 'brief', 'descriptions', 'what', 'astronomers', 'wanted', 'Unfortunately', 'way', 'too', 'much', '20-20', 'hindsight', 'diversions', 'make', 'sense', 'show', 'real', 'strength', 'raw', 'history', 'telescopes', 'seem', 'have', 'found', 'mother', 'lode', 'wonderful', 'photographs', 'showing', 'many', 'construction', 'photos', 'telescopes.So', ""'re"", 'interested', 'telescopes', 'DVD', '5-stars', 'entertainment', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'due', 'many', 'gaps', 'story', 'line']",The Journey to Palomar
1192186,AGH5RJDNL7TAZ,B001FSDP30,"John Stodder ""a.k.a. Juan La Princi""","[14, 15]","This is a beautiful documentary that tells a compelling story about how some very American traits -- individualism, salesmanship, sensationalism, competition, even greed -- became the basis for one of mankind's greatest scientific achievements, mapping the universe.George Ellery Hale was born to privilege, but in Chicago, where even the wealthy and influential need a combination of sharp elbows and charm to get ahead. He applied what he learned in order to get support for the Yerkes Observatory from a dastardly streetcar tycoon, for Mt. Wilson from the ultimate captain of industry, Andrew Carnegie, and finally, for Mt. Palomar from the heirs of Rockefeller.That Hale was driven by a passion for science, not personal wealth or glory, makes the story more fascinating.  The man literally ran himself ragged in his quest to build telescopes that first proved and then added to Einstein's theories, eventually suffering from stress-induced hallucinations. As is said in the film, Hale had ""the American disease"" -- a nervous breakdown caused by ambition and overachievement.At various points, there were serious doubts about the viability of Hale's ideas.  The sequence at the Corning glass factory, illustrated by some amazing archival footage, is a good example.  It was unknown whether glassmakers could produce a mirror of the size and perfection that would be needed to make the telescope work.  The sequences demonstrates American ingenuity, but also shows the high degree of frustration and disappointment that must be tolerated along the way toward an engineering breakthrough.The film effortlessly shifts between the drama of how the telescopes got built and what they taught us.  At the end of the film, the filmmakers show us all of the scientific milestones that Mt. Palomar enabled, most of them long after Hale's death, proving that it is possible to get teary-eyed at recitation of facts about the cosmos.George Hale's name is not one that most Americans think of when they think of the most important contributors to science to come from our shores.  ""The Journey to Palomar"" should go a long way toward correcting that omission.  Hale was one of the greatest Americans of the 20th century, and this film finally gives him his due in the motion-picture format.",5,"Inspiring ""Only in America"" Scientific Story",1241049600,"04 30, 2009",2009,2281,"['beautiful', 'documentary', 'compelling', 'story', 'how', 'very', 'American', 'traits', 'individualism', 'salesmanship', 'sensationalism', 'competition', 'even', 'greed', 'became', 'basis', 'one', 'mankind', 'greatest', 'scientific', 'achievements', 'mapping', 'universe.George', 'Ellery', 'Hale', 'was', 'born', 'privilege', 'Chicago', 'where', 'even', 'wealthy', 'influential', 'need', 'combination', 'sharp', 'elbows', 'charm', 'get', 'ahead', 'applied', 'what', 'learned', 'order', 'get', 'support', 'Yerkes', 'Observatory', 'dastardly', 'streetcar', 'tycoon', 'Mt', 'Wilson', 'ultimate', 'captain', 'industry', 'Andrew', 'Carnegie', 'finally', 'Mt', 'Palomar', 'heirs', 'Rockefeller.That', 'Hale', 'was', 'driven', 'passion', 'science', 'not', 'personal', 'wealth', 'glory', 'story', 'more', 'fascinating', 'man', 'literally', 'ran', 'ragged', 'quest', 'build', 'telescopes', 'first', 'proved', 'then', 'added', 'Einstein', 'theories', 'eventually', 'suffering', 'stress-induced', 'hallucinations', 'As', 'said', 'film', 'Hale', 'had', 'American', 'disease', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'caused', 'ambition', 'overachievement.At', 'various', 'points', 'were', 'serious', 'doubts', 'viability', 'Hale', 'ideas', 'sequence', 'Corning', 'glass', 'factory', 'illustrated', 'amazing', 'archival', 'footage', 'good', 'example', 'was', 'unknown', 'glassmakers', 'could', 'produce', 'mirror', 'size', 'perfection', 'would', 'be', 'needed', 'make', 'telescope', 'work', 'sequences', 'American', 'ingenuity', 'also', 'high', 'degree', 'frustration', 'disappointment', 'must', 'be', 'tolerated', 'way', 'engineering', 'breakthrough.The', 'film', 'effortlessly', 'drama', 'how', 'telescopes', 'got', 'built', 'what', 'taught', 'end', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'show', 'scientific', 'milestones', 'Mt', 'Palomar', 'enabled', 'most', 'long', 'Hale', 'death', 'proving', 'possible', 'get', 'teary-eyed', 'recitation', 'facts', 'cosmos.George', 'Hale', 'name', 'not', 'one', 'most', 'Americans', 'think', 'when', 'think', 'most', 'important', 'contributors', 'science', 'come', 'shores', 'Journey', 'Palomar', 'should', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'correcting', 'omission', 'Hale', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'Americans', '20th', 'century', 'film', 'finally', 'due', 'motion-picture', 'format']",The Journey to Palomar
