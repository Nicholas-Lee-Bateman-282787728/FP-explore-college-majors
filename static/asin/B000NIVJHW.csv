1057022,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000NIVJHW,calvinnme,"[10, 44]","First off, this collection costs a little more than half of what these individual movies do on DVD. That alone makes me suspicious. Next, the description of these movies on this page says that they are in Black and White. The Quiet Man is in color. In fact, I would feel completely taken if I received a copy of The Quiet Man in Black and White. How can you possibly convey the charm of the Irish countryside as John Ford filmed it in anything but living color? Finally, there is the distributor, Lion's Gate. Back in 2004 this same company was responsible for distributing Alf. As has happened in other scenarios with other distributors of sitcoms, we consumers wound up with the syndicated versions of this great unique comedy. However, Lion's Gate completely ignored the fans' complaints and continued releasing syndicated versions of subsequent seasons. All of this taken together makes me very wary. However, if these are indeed quality transfers of these films, then this is the deal of the century. The Quiet Man is just about the best film ever made, The Sands of Iwo Jima starred John Wayne in just about the best role he ever had, and The Flying Tigers is a great war movie, even if it is a fictional account of the actual American Volunteer Group of pilots that flew dangerous missions in World War II. The Wake of the Red Witch is the only entry of the four that is somewhat weak, and it's not that bad.",3,I have my reservations,1173484800,"03 10, 2007",2007,1415,"['First', 'off', 'collection', 'little', 'more', 'half', 'what', 'individual', 'movies', 'do', 'DVD', 'alone', 'suspicious', 'Next', 'description', 'movies', 'page', 'are', 'Black', 'White', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'color', 'fact', 'would', 'feel', 'completely', 'taken', 'received', 'copy', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'Black', 'White', 'How', 'can', 'possibly', 'convey', 'charm', 'Irish', 'countryside', 'John', 'Ford', 'filmed', 'anything', 'living', 'color', 'Finally', 'distributor', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'Back', '2004', 'same', 'company', 'was', 'responsible', 'distributing', 'Alf', 'happened', 'other', 'scenarios', 'other', 'distributors', 'sitcoms', 'consumers', 'wound', 'up', 'syndicated', 'versions', 'great', 'unique', 'comedy', 'However', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'completely', 'ignored', 'fans', 'complaints', 'continued', 'releasing', 'syndicated', 'versions', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'taken', 'together', 'very', 'wary', 'However', 'are', 'indeed', 'quality', 'transfers', 'films', 'then', 'deal', 'century', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'just', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'Sands', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'starred', 'John', 'Wayne', 'just', 'best', 'role', 'ever', 'had', 'Flying', 'Tigers', 'great', 'war', 'movie', 'even', 'fictional', 'account', 'actual', 'American', 'Volunteer', 'Group', 'pilots', 'flew', 'dangerous', 'missions', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Wake', 'Red', 'Witch', 'only', 'entry', 'four', 'somewhat', 'weak', 'not', 'bad']",John Wayne Collection: Volume 1 (The Quiet Man / The Sands of Iwo Jima / Flying Tigers / The Wake of the Red Witch)

Westfall ""westfallwatergardens""","[15, 21]","This review is in response to the other review because I can't stand to have a John Wayne collection with some of his best movies with a three star rating from a guy who doesn't own the thing yet but is upset because his ""Alf"" collection didn't quite work out.  First of all any review of John Wayne that also happens to mention Alf in the same review deserves negative votes, and should be pulled by Amazon. This is the only time I have ever reviewed a product I don't own (though I do own all the movies in their individual forms and the transfer is great, the only beef I've had is the lack of subtitles) and I realize in that sense I'm no better that the other guy, but giving John Wayne three stars is just outrageous.",5,A little balance,1183161600,"06 30, 2007",2007,723,"['review', 'response', 'other', 'review', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'have', 'John', 'Wayne', 'collection', 'best', 'movies', 'three', 'star', 'rating', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'own', 'thing', 'yet', 'upset', 'Alf', 'collection', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'out', 'First', 'review', 'John', 'Wayne', 'also', 'mention', 'Alf', 'same', 'review', 'deserves', 'negative', 'votes', 'should', 'be', 'pulled', 'Amazon', 'only', 'time', 'have', 'ever', 'reviewed', 'product', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'do', 'own', 'movies', 'individual', 'forms', 'transfer', 'great', 'only', 'beef', ""'ve"", 'had', 'lack', 'subtitles', 'realize', 'sense', ""'m"", 'better', 'other', 'guy', 'giving', 'John', 'Wayne', 'three', 'stars', 'just', 'outrageous']",John Wayne Collection: Volume 1 (The Quiet Man / The Sands of Iwo Jima / Flying Tigers / The Wake of the Red Witch)

1057025,A2DVAT6T0JYEQZ,B000NIVJHW,J. Moyer,"[1, 2]","I purchased this collection because I'm looking for a specific film that I only caught the last part of therefore, I don't know the name of the movie. It was some what of a war movie so I thought it might be included in this collection based on the cover. To my surprise, only two of the movies are war movies (and not the one I was looking for). The other two are, according to the jacket, romance movies (though not the mushy stuff of today). I've never seen any of these (if I did, it was only bits and pieces of the war movies) and all were quite enjoyable.The Sands of Iwo Jima (war): This is an exceptional movie with many historic images. The bonus documentary was quite informative. I would have to flag this as the best of the four in this collection. (Black & White)Flying Tigers (war): Good film with a strong message. Haven't watched the bonus features yet so I can't accout for it's historic accuracy. The special effects are poor by today's standard but was probably the best they could do at the time. This doesn't take away from the movie but does remind you that it is an old film. The transfer to DVD is not perfect (a little grainy) but is still watchable. Very good movie and well worth watching. (Black & White)The Wake of the Red Witch (Romance): This movie was quite interesting to me. I didn't know that John Wayne play in a swash buckling type movie as this one. Though the jist of the movie isn't about swash buckling the tone is there. In the first part of the movie, John Wayne sinks the ship Red Witch carrying a cargo of gold. The rest of the movie is about recovering the gold. Along the way, he falls in love but his nimesus end up marrying her. He end up fighting a giant octopus and eventually rejoining with his love, BUT not the way you'd expect. Very entertaining movie. (Black & White)The Quiet Man (Romance): This movie is the only one I have a complaint about. The transfer to DVD is not as good as you'd expect. I don't know if it's due to the poor quality of the actual film or some idiot not paying attention to what he was doing. The movie is a little blury. If you have a standard size TV, it's not too bad (but still noticable). However, if you have a widescreen TV, don't plan on watching this in the wide-to-fit format. I tried to tough it out but within the first 10 minitues of the movie, I found myself switching back and forth on the settings. This is the reason I didn't give this collection 5 stars. The movie itself is quite good but quality is the poorest I've seen. This film is about an American boxer, who killed a man in the ring, going back to his home town in Ireland, making an enemy, falling in love with his enemies sister, corting the sister in the Irish custom, marrying the sister, and fight with his brother-in-law. The last part is remanicent of McClintock when he pulls his wife off the train, drags her 5 mile to find his brother-in-law, and the whole town ending up in a knock-down, drag-out fight. There's quit a bit of suddle humor enterlaced through out the movie which made this quite enjoyable dispite the blurriness. (Color)In summary, the movies themself in this collection are quite good. The only negative is the picture quality.",3,What's good is good; What's bad is annoying...,1278720000,"07 10, 2010",2010,3211,"['purchased', 'collection', ""'m"", 'looking', 'specific', 'film', 'only', 'caught', 'last', 'part', 'therefore', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'name', 'movie', 'was', 'what', 'war', 'movie', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'included', 'collection', 'based', 'cover', 'surprise', 'only', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'war', 'movies', 'not', 'one', 'was', 'looking', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'according', 'jacket', 'romance', 'movies', 'not', 'mushy', 'stuff', 'today', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'did', 'was', 'only', 'bits', 'pieces', 'war', 'movies', 'were', 'quite', 'enjoyable.The', 'Sands', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'war', 'exceptional', 'movie', 'many', 'historic', 'images', 'bonus', 'documentary', 'was', 'quite', 'informative', 'would', 'have', 'flag', 'best', 'four', 'collection', 'Black', 'White', 'Flying', 'Tigers', 'war', 'Good', 'film', 'strong', 'message', 'Have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'bonus', 'yet', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accout', 'historic', 'accuracy', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'poor', 'today', 'standard', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'could', 'do', 'time', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'movie', 'remind', 'old', 'film', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'not', 'perfect', 'little', 'grainy', 'still', 'watchable', 'Very', 'good', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'Black', 'White', 'Wake', 'Red', 'Witch', 'Romance', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'interesting', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'John', 'Wayne', 'play', 'swash', 'buckling', 'type', 'movie', 'one', 'jist', 'movie', ""n't"", 'about', 'swash', 'buckling', 'tone', 'there', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'John', 'Wayne', 'ship', 'Red', 'Witch', 'carrying', 'cargo', 'gold', 'rest', 'movie', 'recovering', 'gold', 'way', 'love', 'nimesus', 'end', 'up', 'marrying', 'end', 'up', 'fighting', 'giant', 'octopus', 'eventually', 'rejoining', 'love', 'BUT', 'not', 'way', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'Black', 'White', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'Romance', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'have', 'complaint', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'not', 'as', 'good', ""'d"", 'expect', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'due', 'poor', 'quality', 'actual', 'film', 'idiot', 'not', 'paying', 'attention', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'movie', 'little', 'blury', 'have', 'standard', 'size', 'TV', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'still', 'noticable', 'However', 'have', 'widescreen', 'TV', 'do', ""n't"", 'plan', 'watching', 'wide-to-fit', 'format', 'tried', 'tough', 'out', 'first', '10', 'minitues', 'movie', 'found', 'switching', 'back', 'forth', 'settings', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'collection', '5', 'stars', 'movie', 'quite', 'good', 'quality', 'poorest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'American', 'boxer', 'who', 'killed', 'man', 'ring', 'going', 'back', 'home', 'town', 'Ireland', 'making', 'enemy', 'falling', 'love', 'enemies', 'sister', 'corting', 'sister', 'Irish', 'custom', 'marrying', 'sister', 'fight', 'brother-in-law', 'last', 'part', 'remanicent', 'McClintock', 'when', 'wife', 'train', '5', 'mile', 'find', 'brother-in-law', 'whole', 'town', 'ending', 'up', 'knock-down', 'drag-out', 'fight', 'quit', 'bit', 'suddle', 'humor', 'enterlaced', 'movie', 'made', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'dispite', 'blurriness', 'Color', 'summary', 'movies', 'themself', 'collection', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'only', 'negative', 'picture', 'quality']",John Wayne Collection: Volume 1 (The Quiet Man / The Sands of Iwo Jima / Flying Tigers / The Wake of the Red Witch)
