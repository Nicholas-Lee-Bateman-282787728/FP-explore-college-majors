792766,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00013WWSY,Alistair McHarg,"[0, 0]","How you feel about this film will depend in large part on your perception of Ann - played brilliantly by Sarah Polley who offers an unvarnished, raw, powerful performance.  A young woman told she has only weeks to live keeps the information to herself and orchestrates the end of her life down to the last detail.  Is she selfish and insensitive - or - facing the end, has she finally decided to live as she wishes?  That she spends so much of this precious time preparing her near and dear for the inevitable departure - without them knowing it - should be factored in.My Life Without Me is so threadbare and rough that it often feels like a documentary.  Ann works nights on a cleaning crew and lives with her husband and two young daughters in a trailer.  We spend a lot of time in that trailer with them and it gets downright claustrophobic, you can see the chips in the linoleum.  That grit is characteristic of this movie, there is no slick artifice to relieve the pressure, and no maudlin goopiness to shamelessly milk the weepier moments.  It's an emotional film, and you'd have to be a pretty cold fish for it not to get to you.  But sadness and beauty are always hand in hand here, and the tears are always earned.The picture benefits from an exceptional, and improbable cast.  Amanda Plummer as Ann's friend, wonderful work by Deborah Harry as her embittered mother, and an uncredited cameo by the great Alfred Molina as her father.  But the star turn is Mark Ruffalo as Don, Ann's secret love - the only man she's ever known besides her husband.  Ruffalo has stunning screen presence, his vulnerability is brave, and his ability to interact amazing.  There is a scene when he and Ann are first falling in love.  Don's house is literally empty so they listen to a tape in his car.  It is raining buckets.  That scene is one of many where Ruffalo and Polley create film magic.  (The original film score by Alfonso Vilallonga is inspired.)My Life Without Me belongs to Isabel Coixet who directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Nanci Kincaid - Kincaid's book provided the foundation.  It's one woman's story of dealing with an extraordinary situation, and Sarah Polley makes that woman credible and sympathetic, regardless of your take on what she does.  It does make for interesting conversation - what would you do if you were in Ann's shoes?  But that's your movie.  What Ann chooses to do is her movie, and it is both deeply moving and exquisitely beautiful.",5,Never Can Say Goodbye,1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,2472,"['How', 'feel', 'film', 'will', 'depend', 'large', 'part', 'perception', 'Ann', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'who', 'unvarnished', 'raw', 'powerful', 'performance', 'young', 'woman', 'told', 'only', 'weeks', 'live', 'keeps', 'information', 'herself', 'end', 'life', 'last', 'detail', 'selfish', 'insensitive', 'facing', 'end', 'finally', 'decided', 'live', 'so', 'much', 'precious', 'time', 'preparing', 'near', 'dear', 'inevitable', 'departure', 'knowing', 'should', 'be', 'factored', 'in.My', 'Life', 'Me', 'so', 'threadbare', 'rough', 'often', 'documentary', 'Ann', 'nights', 'cleaning', 'crew', 'husband', 'two', 'young', 'daughters', 'trailer', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'trailer', 'downright', 'claustrophobic', 'can', 'see', 'chips', 'linoleum', 'grit', 'characteristic', 'movie', 'slick', 'artifice', 'relieve', 'pressure', 'maudlin', 'goopiness', 'shamelessly', 'milk', 'weepier', 'moments', 'emotional', 'film', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'pretty', 'cold', 'fish', 'not', 'get', 'sadness', 'beauty', 'are', 'always', 'hand', 'hand', 'here', 'tears', 'are', 'always', 'earned.The', 'picture', 'benefits', 'exceptional', 'improbable', 'cast', 'Amanda', 'Plummer', 'Ann', 'friend', 'wonderful', 'work', 'Deborah', 'Harry', 'embittered', 'mother', 'uncredited', 'cameo', 'great', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'father', 'star', 'turn', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Don', 'Ann', 'secret', 'love', 'only', 'man', 'ever', 'known', 'husband', 'Ruffalo', 'stunning', 'screen', 'presence', 'vulnerability', 'brave', 'ability', 'interact', 'amazing', 'scene', 'when', 'Ann', 'are', 'first', 'falling', 'love', 'Don', 'house', 'literally', 'empty', 'listen', 'tape', 'car', 'raining', 'buckets', 'scene', 'one', 'many', 'where', 'Ruffalo', 'Polley', 'create', 'film', 'magic', 'original', 'film', 'score', 'Alfonso', 'Vilallonga', 'inspired', 'Life', 'Me', 'Isabel', 'Coixet', 'who', 'directed', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'Nanci', 'Kincaid', 'Kincaid', 'book', 'provided', 'foundation', 'one', 'woman', 'story', 'dealing', 'extraordinary', 'situation', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'woman', 'credible', 'sympathetic', 'regardless', 'take', 'what', 'make', 'interesting', 'conversation', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'were', 'Ann', 'shoes', 'movie', 'What', 'Ann', 'do', 'movie', 'deeply', 'moving', 'exquisitely', 'beautiful']",N/A

If there was a worse film than Terms of Endearment then I'm still to find it.  Shirley McClaine reminded me of my ex mother-in-law and that thought sends shivers up my spine.""My Life Without Me"" does try hard and is well acted.  The film is certainly believable.  Indeed, the very concept of coming to terms with one's imminent death must truly be a struggle.  This would be especially the case for the young.  In Sarah Polly, a star is born!However, in spite of its charms, the film never really captures the viewer.  The plot, to the extent that one exists, is tediously slow.

792769,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00013WWSY,B. E Jackson,"[1, 3]","My Life Without Me had all the potential in the world to be a devastatingly brilliant piece of emotional writing.  However instead, the storyline eventually falls apart and I lose interest as a result.It's about a young mother who goes to the hospital after passing out on the kitchen floor and the doctor discovers that she has cancer.  Now how's THIS for weird- when the doctor sits the mother down to explain she has 2 months to live, her reaction isn't shock, sadness or confusion.  It's... like nothing even happened.Her reaction is basically like she's carrying a normal conversation about any ol' thing so it's no big deal at all.  She even asks the doctor for a piece of candy a minute later.  Weird indeed!Now where the movie completely misses the mark is when the storyline tries to get going.  The mother wants to tie up some loose ends before her life comes to a tragic end, however she never really accomplishes much of anything (except for making a few tapes to give to her daughters when they're older).Let's talk about those tapes.  The scene where the mother is sitting in a car and making tapes for her two daughters so they can listen to them when they're old enough to understand them is the ONLY attempt at emotional writing this film delivers.  I'm quite surprised.Around halfway through, I realize My Life Without Me isn't really going anywhere at all.  The mother carries overlong and uninteresting conversations with the closest people in her life (her mom, husband, friends... and even her father who's in prison) and she even falls in love with another man who she meets at a laundry mat.Of course a HUGE issue here is whether it's right or wrong to cheat on your spouse with another man when you're dying of cancer because the woman doesn't have much time left anyway.  I personally think it's wrong because you should spend the remainder of your time with the ones who you're 100% convinced love you the most- not some stranger you just met.Anyway, these needless conversations barely relate to the storyline and they do basically nothing to interest viewers.I guess the only appealing factor with this movie is watching and waiting for the moment when the mother is either forced to tell her family that she has cancer because of her inability to gain enough strength, or when the family finds out themselves.  I'm not spoiling what happens though so you'll have to guess.Pretty bland and uninspiring writing severely distracts what could have been an emotional piece of perfection.",3,goes nowhere too often,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,2512,"['Life', 'Me', 'had', 'potential', 'world', 'be', 'devastatingly', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'emotional', 'writing', 'However', 'instead', 'storyline', 'eventually', 'apart', 'lose', 'interest', 'result.It', 'young', 'mother', 'who', 'hospital', 'passing', 'out', 'kitchen', 'floor', 'doctor', 'cancer', 'Now', 'how', 'THIS', 'weird-', 'when', 'doctor', 'mother', 'down', 'explain', '2', 'months', 'live', 'reaction', ""n't"", 'shock', 'sadness', 'confusion', 'nothing', 'even', 'reaction', 'basically', 'carrying', 'normal', 'conversation', 'ol', 'thing', 'big', 'deal', 'even', 'doctor', 'piece', 'candy', 'minute', 'later', 'Weird', 'indeed', 'Now', 'where', 'movie', 'completely', 'mark', 'when', 'storyline', 'get', 'going', 'mother', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'life', 'tragic', 'end', 'however', 'never', 'really', 'much', 'anything', 'making', 'few', 'tapes', 'give', 'daughters', 'when', ""'re"", 'older', '.Let', 'talk', 'tapes', 'scene', 'where', 'mother', 'sitting', 'car', 'making', 'tapes', 'two', 'daughters', 'can', 'listen', 'when', ""'re"", 'old', 'enough', 'understand', 'ONLY', 'attempt', 'emotional', 'writing', 'film', 'delivers', ""'m"", 'quite', 'surprised.Around', 'halfway', 'realize', 'Life', 'Me', ""n't"", 'really', 'going', 'anywhere', 'mother', 'overlong', 'uninteresting', 'conversations', 'closest', 'people', 'life', 'mom', 'husband', 'friends', 'even', 'father', 'who', 'prison', 'even', 'love', 'man', 'who', 'laundry', 'mat.Of', 'course', 'HUGE', 'issue', 'here', 'right', 'wrong', 'cheat', 'spouse', 'man', 'when', ""'re"", 'dying', 'cancer', 'woman', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'time', 'left', 'anyway', 'personally', 'think', 'wrong', 'should', 'spend', 'remainder', 'time', 'ones', 'who', ""'re"", '100', '%', 'convinced', 'most-', 'not', 'stranger', 'just', 'met.Anyway', 'needless', 'conversations', 'barely', 'relate', 'storyline', 'do', 'basically', 'nothing', 'interest', 'viewers.I', 'guess', 'only', 'appealing', 'factor', 'movie', 'watching', 'waiting', 'moment', 'when', 'mother', 'either', 'forced', 'tell', 'family', 'cancer', 'inability', 'gain', 'enough', 'strength', 'when', 'family', 'out', ""'m"", 'not', 'spoiling', 'what', 'so', ""'ll"", 'have', 'guess.Pretty', 'bland', 'uninspiring', 'writing', 'severely', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'emotional', 'piece', 'perfection']",N/A

792772,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B00013WWSY,C. Middleton,"[1, 1]","This subtle and sensitive film begins with a poetic monologue. Ann (Sarah Polly) is standing in the pouring rain, her eyes closed, drenched to the bone, describing exactly what she feels...hearing the raindrops patter against the leaves, feeling the grass beneath her bare feet beginning to dampen...she then tells us that she has never been that type of person to sit and watch a sunset or lay on the beach observing the waves of the ocean for hours nor stand in the pouring rain. But life for Ann has changed and with it a new appreciation for life.Married at 17 to a loving father and husband, Don (Scott Speedman) with two pretty daughters, at 23, Ann's life is her cleaning job at the local university, her family, living in a trailer in the back of her mother's (Deborah Harry) house and the simple banalities of surviving from day to day. One morning she collapses in her kitchen and later tests are done that determine she has tumours in her ovaries growing and accelerating towards her liver. The condition is untreatable thus she is told she has two to three months to live.The utmost courage this young woman shows us once receiving her death sentence is laudable in the truest sense. Rather than run home and tell her family and friend's about her imminent death, she chooses to keep it to herself to spare them of the sorrow. After receiving the news, she sits in a coffee shop and makes a list of twenty things she would like to do before she departs. Under these dire circumstances, one would assume the list to include going to Europe, climbing Mount Everest or a road trip around the United States, however her items are simple actions like saying what she feels, seeing her father who she hasn't seen in ten years because he's in jail; getting a new hair style and her nails done. The most radical item on the list is to make love to another man because aside from her husband she has never had an encounter of this type thus she wants to know how it feels. Enter a handsome man (Mark Ruffalo) who has been watching Ann in the coffee shop making her list. There is no pre-meditated ""seduction"" from either of them which has been stated in all the blurbs for the story. There is chemistry and attraction which is followed up and consummated though this is not a ""one-night-stand"" situation because, unexpectedly, true love enters the picture.Ann now proceeds to make a series of recorded tapes for her children to be listened to on their birthdays till their 18. She makes a tape for her mother, her loving husband and of course her lover.This film is indeed modest lacking in any self consciousness, kind and compassionate.How we behave when facing our death can reveal our true character, and in Ann's case, she has integrity and courage coupled with humility that was inspiring to watch.My Life without Me is a wonderful film.",5,Tender and Compassionate,1186531200,"08 8, 2007",2007,2846,"['subtle', 'sensitive', 'film', 'poetic', 'monologue', 'Ann', 'Sarah', 'Polly', 'standing', 'pouring', 'rain', 'eyes', 'closed', 'drenched', 'bone', 'describing', 'exactly', 'what', 'feels', 'hearing', 'raindrops', 'patter', 'leaves', 'feeling', 'grass', 'bare', 'feet', 'beginning', 'dampen', 'then', 'never', 'been', 'type', 'person', 'sit', 'watch', 'sunset', 'lay', 'beach', 'observing', 'waves', 'ocean', 'hours', 'stand', 'pouring', 'rain', 'life', 'Ann', 'changed', 'new', 'appreciation', 'life.Married', '17', 'loving', 'father', 'husband', 'Don', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'two', 'pretty', 'daughters', '23', 'Ann', 'life', 'cleaning', 'job', 'local', 'university', 'family', 'living', 'trailer', 'back', 'mother', 'Deborah', 'Harry', 'house', 'simple', 'banalities', 'surviving', 'day', 'day', 'One', 'morning', 'kitchen', 'later', 'tests', 'are', 'done', 'determine', 'tumours', 'ovaries', 'growing', 'accelerating', 'towards', 'liver', 'condition', 'untreatable', 'thus', 'told', 'two', 'three', 'months', 'live.The', 'utmost', 'courage', 'young', 'woman', 'once', 'receiving', 'death', 'sentence', 'laudable', 'truest', 'sense', 'Rather', 'run', 'home', 'tell', 'family', 'friend', 'imminent', 'death', 'keep', 'herself', 'spare', 'sorrow', 'receiving', 'news', 'coffee', 'shop', 'list', 'twenty', 'things', 'would', 'like', 'do', 'dire', 'circumstances', 'one', 'would', 'assume', 'list', 'include', 'going', 'Europe', 'climbing', 'Mount', 'Everest', 'road', 'trip', 'United', 'States', 'however', 'items', 'are', 'simple', 'actions', 'saying', 'what', 'seeing', 'father', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'ten', 'years', 'jail', 'getting', 'new', 'hair', 'style', 'nails', 'done', 'most', 'radical', 'item', 'list', 'make', 'love', 'man', 'aside', 'husband', 'never', 'had', 'encounter', 'type', 'thus', 'know', 'how', 'Enter', 'handsome', 'man', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'who', 'been', 'watching', 'Ann', 'coffee', 'shop', 'making', 'list', 'pre-meditated', 'seduction', 'been', 'stated', 'blurbs', 'story', 'chemistry', 'attraction', 'followed', 'up', 'consummated', 'not', 'one-night-stand', 'situation', 'unexpectedly', 'true', 'love', 'picture.Ann', 'now', 'make', 'series', 'recorded', 'tapes', 'children', 'be', 'listened', 'birthdays', 'till', '18', 'tape', 'mother', 'loving', 'husband', 'course', 'lover.This', 'film', 'indeed', 'modest', 'lacking', 'self', 'consciousness', 'kind', 'compassionate.How', 'behave', 'when', 'facing', 'death', 'can', 'reveal', 'true', 'character', 'Ann', 'case', 'integrity', 'courage', 'coupled', 'humility', 'was', 'inspiring', 'watch.My', 'Life', 'Me', 'wonderful', 'film']",N/A

In My Life Without Me they have a script and a director and each other to stretch with and the results are provocative and moving. From the first few moments of this artfully photographed archive of the last days of a life, I knew I was in for a treat. But nothing can prepare you for the powerful treatment of loss and grief which Polley's seemingly effortless portrayal of a doomed twenty-three year-old mother of two provides. There are actors who compel empathy in their audience simply by being so deeply immersed in character that states of emotional upheaval are communicated as if by telepathy. Polley has the gift. Whatever part she takes on she inhabits completely. Brilliant acting aside, I thought the narrative structure of My Life Without Me was quirky, full of surprise and never maudlin. Polley comments at one point in an unusually insightful voiceover about her fate that 'no one thinks about death in a supermarket.' This film exists precisely for those who would like nothing better than to spend a few hours thinking about the inevitable transition into oblivion. And about the legacy one would like to leave behind for those whom we love.",5,A Fiercely Intelligent Meditation On The Unthinkable,1081814400,"04 13, 2004",2004,1269,"['Sarah', 'Polley', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Here', 'have', 'two', 'most', 'talented', 'interesting', 'actors', 'work', 'film', 'today', 'My', 'Life', 'Me', 'have', 'script', 'director', 'other', 'stretch', 'results', 'are', 'provocative', 'moving', 'first', 'few', 'moments', 'artfully', 'photographed', 'archive', 'last', 'days', 'life', 'knew', 'was', 'treat', 'nothing', 'can', 'prepare', 'powerful', 'treatment', 'loss', 'grief', 'Polley', 'seemingly', 'effortless', 'portrayal', 'doomed', 'twenty-three', 'year-old', 'mother', 'two', 'are', 'actors', 'who', 'compel', 'empathy', 'audience', 'simply', 'being', 'so', 'deeply', 'immersed', 'character', 'states', 'emotional', 'upheaval', 'are', 'communicated', 'telepathy', 'Polley', 'gift', 'part', 'completely', 'Brilliant', 'acting', 'aside', 'thought', 'narrative', 'structure', 'My', 'Life', 'Me', 'was', 'quirky', 'full', 'surprise', 'never', 'maudlin', 'Polley', 'comments', 'one', 'point', 'unusually', 'insightful', 'voiceover', 'fate', 'one', 'death', 'supermarket', 'film', 'precisely', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'nothing', 'better', 'spend', 'few', 'hours', 'thinking', 'inevitable', 'transition', 'oblivion', 'legacy', 'one', 'would', 'like', 'leave', 'behind', 'whom', 'love']",N/A

Karasik,"[3, 3]","While there are any number of films that address a main character's death in a touching, tear-jerky manner (think ""Beaches"" and ""Terms of Endearment""), this film is refreshing because the central character, Anne, decides to take control of her death with extraordinary clarity of purpose.  When Anne receives her dire medical prognosis, she decides to hide her illness from her family as long as possible, both as a final gift to them, and so that she can accomplish certain goals.  Her levelheaded and methodical approach to her imminent death (one of the first things she does is to write up a list of ""things to do before I die"") may seem a bit artificial, but it works well as a device to structure the film, and it reminds us that it really is never too early to make such a list.  The film beautifully conveys Anne's insatiable hunger and nostalgia for life as it slips away, and yet mostly manages to avoid descending into maudlin sentimentality.  In fact, the only scene in the film that made me cry was a heartbreaking little anecdote which Anne's neighbor recites from her experiences as an obstetrics nurse.  Anne's selfless desire that her family find happiness after she is gone, and her decision to forgive those close to her, are worthy topics and, while some might perceive her as too perfectly controlled, her responses are not inconceivable for someone in her position.  In this culture where we mostly exist in materialistic denial, this film is a piquant reminder that it might be a good idea to let mortality inform our daily decisions and interactions a bit more closely.",4,A heavy topic depicted with a light touch,1092355200,"08 13, 2004",2004,1593,"['are', 'number', 'films', 'address', 'main', 'character', 'death', 'touching', 'tear-jerky', 'manner', 'think', 'Beaches', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'film', 'refreshing', 'central', 'character', 'Anne', 'take', 'control', 'death', 'extraordinary', 'clarity', 'purpose', 'When', 'Anne', 'dire', 'medical', 'prognosis', 'hide', 'illness', 'family', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'final', 'gift', 'so', 'can', 'accomplish', 'certain', 'goals', 'levelheaded', 'methodical', 'approach', 'imminent', 'death', 'one', 'first', 'things', 'write', 'up', 'list', 'things', 'do', 'die', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'artificial', 'well', 'device', 'structure', 'film', 'really', 'never', 'too', 'early', 'make', 'such', 'list', 'film', 'beautifully', 'Anne', 'insatiable', 'hunger', 'nostalgia', 'life', 'away', 'yet', 'mostly', 'avoid', 'descending', 'maudlin', 'sentimentality', 'fact', 'only', 'scene', 'film', 'made', 'cry', 'was', 'heartbreaking', 'little', 'anecdote', 'Anne', 'neighbor', 'experiences', 'obstetrics', 'nurse', 'Anne', 'selfless', 'desire', 'family', 'find', 'happiness', 'gone', 'decision', 'forgive', 'close', 'are', 'worthy', 'topics', 'might', 'perceive', 'too', 'perfectly', 'controlled', 'responses', 'are', 'not', 'inconceivable', 'someone', 'position', 'culture', 'where', 'mostly', 'exist', 'materialistic', 'denial', 'film', 'piquant', 'reminder', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'let', 'mortality', 'inform', 'daily', 'decisions', 'interactions', 'bit', 'more', 'closely']",N/A

Isabel Coixet is the creator here and she has assembled a cast that combines highly experienced professionals with actors less well known and makes an ensemble movie that works on every level.  There is no giving away the plot in this outing, as from the very first words uttered you know that you are going to 'live through' the dying process of Ann, the perfect mother and wife who incidentally has advanced metastatic ovarian cancer when she first visits her doctor for nausea.  Sarah Polley creates a believable lead, holding back the gush and the devastation that accompany her discovery, and instead gives us a young woman who makes a 'list of things to do before I die' and then proceeds on with her life and its new order until she does indeed die.  Along the way we get to know her husband Don (played with wit, sensuality, and empathy by Scott Speedman), her co-worker - the ever-dieting Laurie (Amanda Plummer), her assignation lover Lee (Mark Rufallo, always growing as an actor), her mother (Deborah Harry), her hairdresser (Maria de Medeiros), her father (Alfred Molina in a brief but perfectly acted cameo), and a new friend Ann (Leonor Watling - watch this actress...).

Sarah Polley is wonderful in this role and, in spite of a somewhat sentimental story, makes her character believable and real.  She's only 23 years old, lives in a trailer with her husband and two young daughters, and works nights cleaning at the local university.  Their marriage is happy, the children adorable.The doctor who gives her the news, played by Julian Richings has one of the most memorable and homely faces I have ever seen.  He, himself, is saddened and finds it hard to look her straight in the eye.  He alone keeps her secret and agrees to hold on to some tapes she makes to be given to her loved ones after she dies.Her ""to do"" list is unique.  Even though she loves her husband, she wants to know what it would be like to sleep with another man and have him fall in love with her.  She does that with Mark Ruffalo, a gentle and lonely man she meets in a laundromat.  She also goes to visit her father who is in jail and they have a poignant scene together.  Deborah Harry plays her bitter mother who's lived a life of disappointments but loves her daughter and grandchildren.One of the beauties of the story is that this young woman manages to tie up all the details of her young life in a practical, efficient way - even going so far as to find a future wife for her husband.  Her choices are hers alone and she handles them with courage.  Basically, the story is a soap opera and usually I don't like those kind of films.

They live in a small trailer that sits in her mother's backyard. Having her first child at the age of seventeen, she has never really experienced the dreams and passions that so many her age possess throughout their lives.The essence of the movie is how Ann deals with the news that she has terminal ovarian cancer, which is spreading rapidly. With only two to three months to live, she makes a list of things to do before she dies, which includes everything from changing her hair to recording birthday messages for both of her children for every birthday until they reach eighteen.

She's quite simply luminous and yet very, very real.  And while I could not see myself not sharing my impending demise with those who I love and love me, I think I can understand why ""Ann"" (the character Polley plays) did what she did.  I think she was someone who had been happily submerged in being a good wife, a dutiful daughter, a loving mother from such an early age (17) that she hadn't lived enough for herself.  Ironically, her impending death was her wake-up call to to do just that.It's this ""selfishness"" which caused someone else in my family to give up on the movie, the moment they saw Ann ticking off one of the items on her ""bucket list"" by engaging in a brief, passionate, and bittersweet affair with the lonely young surveyor played by Mark Ruffalo (quite well).  But I'd like to think that while what Ann did would be very hard to understand, if I was her husband, I would say, ""she went a little crazy when she learned she was going to die but I still love her and her memory.""  And I'd like to think that if I was her lover, I'd understand and treasure her memory, and maybe say to myself, ""I never would have known her otherwise.""And I would like to think that God wouldn't hold a brief spate of selfishness at the end of a good life against all the good things such a person's life had brought to all those who she knew.And while the movie was shot on a low budget, there are some beautiful moments in it...like when she tells Ruffalo's character that if he doesn't kiss her, she'll scream...and does.  Or when her doctor brings her candy for one of her appointments with him because that's what she had asked him for immediately after he first gave her the bad news.  Still another is when Ann simply stands in the rain and savors the feeling of it falling on her face, a simple pleasure she never took the time to enjoy until time was something she didn't have.So I give it five stars for being thought provoking and moving.",5,"Powerful, Moving, but Not For Everyone",1248134400,"07 21, 2009",2009,2104,"['find', 'wondering', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'paid', 'full', 'price', 'Borders', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'starring', 'quite', 'simply', 'luminous', 'yet', 'very', 'very', 'real', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'not', 'sharing', 'impending', 'demise', 'who', 'love', 'love', 'think', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'Ann', 'character', 'Polley', 'plays', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'happily', 'submerged', 'being', 'good', 'wife', 'dutiful', 'daughter', 'loving', 'mother', 'early', 'age', '17', 'had', ""n't"", 'lived', 'enough', 'Ironically', 'impending', 'death', 'was', 'wake-up', 'call', 'do', 'just', 'that.It', 'selfishness', 'caused', 'someone', 'else', 'family', 'give', 'up', 'movie', 'moment', 'saw', 'Ann', 'ticking', 'off', 'one', 'items', 'bucket', 'list', 'engaging', 'brief', 'passionate', 'bittersweet', 'affair', 'lonely', 'young', 'surveyor', 'played', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'quite', 'well', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'what', 'Ann', 'did', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'hard', 'understand', 'was', 'husband', 'would', 'say', 'went', 'little', 'crazy', 'when', 'learned', 'was', 'going', 'die', 'still', 'love', 'memory', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'was', 'lover', ""'d"", 'understand', 'treasure', 'memory', 'maybe', 'say', 'myself', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'otherwise', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'God', 'would', ""n't"", 'hold', 'brief', 'spate', 'selfishness', 'end', 'good', 'life', 'good', 'things', 'such', 'person', 'life', 'had', 'brought', 'who', 'knew.And', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'low', 'budget', 'are', 'beautiful', 'moments', 'when', 'Ruffalo', 'character', ""n't"", 'kiss', ""'ll"", 'scream', 'when', 'doctor', 'candy', 'one', 'appointments', 'what', 'had', 'asked', 'immediately', 'first', 'gave', 'bad', 'news', 'Still', 'when', 'Ann', 'simply', 'rain', 'savors', 'feeling', 'falling', 'face', 'simple', 'pleasure', 'never', 'took', 'time', 'enjoy', 'time', 'was', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'have.So', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'being', 'thought', 'provoking', 'moving']",N/A

Sherwin,"[1, 1]","My Life Without Me is a powerful, poignant film with excellent acting and a plot that grabbed my attention and never let go until the very end! The story moves along at a good pace; I certainly wasn't bored especially with those fine performances by the actors! The cinematography and choreography reflect great forethought and the musical score enhances the film, too.When the film starts, we meet twenty-three year old Ann (Sarah Polley); Ann lives in a trailer in her mother's (Deborah Harry) backyard along with her husband Don (Scott Speedman) and their two daughters Penny and Patsy (Jessica Amlee and Kenya Jo Kennedy). Ann has a job cleaning at a local university most nights and her slacker husband Don is looking for work. On the very same day that Don does get a job, Ann is diagnosed with terminal cancer and the doctor (Julian Richings) tells her she has two months, maybe three, to live.Ann is certainly not prepared to hear this; but she quickly becomes focused on what she wants to do with her remaining time. She writes her ""bucket list"" which includes sweet goals like telling her two daughters how much she loves them several times each day and finding a new wife for Don who will also get along quite well with Penny and Patsy. However, she doesn't tell anyone she's dying--not even Don and her mother. Instead, Ann wants to experience a few things in life that, in her opinion, she has missed out on--romance with another man since Don is the only man she's ever been with and even making that man fall in love with her while never telling him either that she's terminally ill. Of course, these goals have created a controversy among the many viewers of this film. Suffice it to say that Ann doesn't truly want to hurt anyone but with her being so young and inexperienced some of her desires are selfish. Ann is also irrational as sometimes dying people can be. Ann's choices also give her some control over life in the time she has left. Sure, I would have done a few things differently (and more maturely) than Ann but then again I'm not Ann.Of course, the remainder of the film shows the viewer how everything plays out. Look also for solid performances by Mark Ruffalo as Lee; Amanda Plummer as Laurie, Ann's friend at work; Alfred Molina as Ann's father; Maria de Medeiros as a hairdresser and Leonor Watling as a new neighbor who is also named Ann.The DVD comes with a ""making of"" featurette; this is also well done.My Life Without Me struck a chord in me; I was reminded of how I almost lost my life to stage four cancer several years ago. I can certainly identify with a dying patient's desire to write and carry out the goals of a ""bucket list.""

Crammer,"[0, 0]","This Canadian film (set in British Columbia) tells the story of a young working class woman who learns she has a fast-growing, untreatable cancer and will be dead within months.  Oddly enough, she decides not to tell ANYONE (how can she stand it?) and instead makes a list of things she wants to do before she dies.  Much of the film involves an affair she has (with a character played by Mark Ruffalo) -- she had her first child at 17, and her husband has been her first and only, so she wants to broaden her experience of life before she dies.  I think the way she handles this news of her impending death is odd and probably unfair to the people she loves (she doesn't see it that way), and I think  someone who did that in real life would leave a lot of angry people behind, who never had a chance to say the things they wanted to say.  But this is a film, after all, and it's credible that someone would do this.  She is, after all, very young and  the very young don't always make great choices.

792798,A3FE8FQPQPONAW,B00013WWSY,Michelle Pettit,"[6, 8]","mark ruffalo and sarah polley are wonderful in this film -- i saw feelings conveyed in their eyes ... instead of hearing platitudes rattled off from their lips.if only for the acting this deserves five starshowever the writing leaves me wondering on the basic premise.for one thing there's a story told by the neighbor ann -- about the death of infant siamese twins -- in which one twin is a boy and the other a girl.....This IS NOT possible!  siamese twins are always the same sex. this took me out of the story as I mused how such a thing could have got past the writers, the director, the actors, everyone.SECONDLY and probably more importantly is how the movie plays out --it is never called into question about the heroine's choice to keep everyone from knowing she is dying.  it is one thing to explore this woman's choice -- but then to give it all a ""happy"" ending -- something seemed simplified to me; as though her choice was lauded.  and although on one hand she seemed to want to protect her family and friends by keeping the truth of her dying from them... it was a basic betrayal.  they never really knew who she was because she didn't let anyone in.  If she had come clean to someone about her dying-- then there would be more moral truth to the tale.  but the movie treats her as a heroine; not questioning what she's decided.  i know someone who had a terminal disease and did the same thing.  her husband and son felt someone they loved lied to them; betrayed them stole something from them; and didn't trust them or truly love them enough to tell them.  Pity a movie which decides to promote lying on such a human and important scale.  It seems a simplistic and romantic and juvenile way to look at a person's death.  Why the montage at the end as though everyone she had left behind was now happy and strong because of the way she handled her death?  and what kind of moral choice was it to ""make another man fall in love"" with her (her words per her list of ""Things to do before I die"") when she knew she was going to die and not let him know what was happening?",3,beautifully acted; writing questionable,1096243200,"09 27, 2004",2004,2083,"['mark', 'ruffalo', 'sarah', 'polley', 'are', 'wonderful', 'film', 'i', 'saw', 'feelings', 'conveyed', 'eyes', 'instead', 'hearing', 'platitudes', 'rattled', 'off', 'lips.if', 'only', 'acting', 'five', 'starshowever', 'writing', 'wondering', 'basic', 'premise.for', 'one', 'thing', 'story', 'told', 'neighbor', 'ann', 'death', 'infant', 'siamese', 'twins', 'one', 'twin', 'boy', 'other', 'girl', '..This', 'NOT', 'possible', 'siamese', 'twins', 'are', 'always', 'same', 'sex', 'took', 'story', 'mused', 'how', 'such', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'got', 'writers', 'director', 'actors', 'everyone.SECONDLY', 'probably', 'more', 'importantly', 'how', 'movie', 'out', 'never', 'called', 'question', 'heroine', 'choice', 'keep', 'everyone', 'knowing', 'dying', 'one', 'thing', 'explore', 'woman', 'choice', 'then', 'give', 'happy', 'ending', 'something', 'seemed', 'simplified', 'choice', 'was', 'lauded', 'one', 'hand', 'seemed', 'want', 'protect', 'family', 'friends', 'keeping', 'truth', 'dying', 'was', 'basic', 'betrayal', 'never', 'really', 'knew', 'who', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'anyone', 'had', 'come', 'clean', 'someone', 'dying', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'moral', 'truth', 'tale', 'movie', 'heroine', 'not', 'questioning', 'what', 'decided', 'i', 'know', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'terminal', 'disease', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'husband', 'son', 'felt', 'someone', 'loved', 'lied', 'betrayed', 'stole', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'trust', 'truly', 'love', 'enough', 'tell', 'Pity', 'movie', 'promote', 'lying', 'human', 'important', 'scale', 'simplistic', 'romantic', 'juvenile', 'way', 'look', 'person', 'death', 'Why', 'montage', 'end', 'everyone', 'had', 'left', 'behind', 'was', 'now', 'happy', 'strong', 'way', 'handled', 'death', 'what', 'kind', 'moral', 'choice', 'was', 'make', 'man', 'fall', 'love', 'words', 'list', 'Things', 'do', 'die', 'when', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'die', 'not', 'let', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'happening']",N/A

Her resilience is almost unbelievable, in fact many would question whether such a reaction to imminent death would be possible in real life. However in the context of this film it works because Sarah Polleys performance is that good that she makes palpable what would otherwise be ludicrous fantasy, such as her ability to keep the horrible fact she has advanced cancer from everyone she knows while calmly pursuing her final list of goals.In fact the whole cast is superb. Her affair with a man she meets in a laundromat (Mark Ruffalo) is very brief however entails some of the most powerful drama I have seen in a film. Thankfully the film does not depict her very last days as it would be too much for the viewer to take, who like me will be completely in awe of Ann or perhaps repulsed by the selfishness of her affair and the fact that she hides the truth from those she loves.

After suffering through it, I came to realize it has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen -- no, wait, it IS THE worst movie I have ever seen. All characters are two-dimensional, the story stinks, it is badly acted, directed, filmed, etc. etc. For starters, the film has many mistakes worth noting, the worst of which is the fact that siamese twins CANNOT be of different sex as they come from the same egg. If you are going to direct a movie, you better first get your facts straight, madame director. The main character says she was born in a certain month, and later she mentions her astrological sign which doesn't coincide with her month of birth (but, anyway, who cares?). Debbie Harry's role is irrelevant and was painful to watch her all washed-up. But the main faults go to the main actress and the director. Among the worst ever filmed. Lastly, the dying girl is allegedly so in love with her husband (which is the only one redeemable here) and, still, once she knows she has 2 months to live, she embarks into trying to bed another man; he meets one withing days and she also falls in love with him. Give me a break! Did the slut in her emerge once she knew she was dying? I gave this film 1 star only because ZERO stars was not an option.

792805,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00013WWSY,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","***1/2A film from Canada, ""My Life Without Me"" is an understated account of a terminally ill woman's attempt to find meaning in her life before she dies.  Anne is a 23-year old custodian who lives with her pool-cleaning husband and two daughters in a trailer behind her mother's house.  When she receives the stunning news that she has only a few months to live, Anne decides to spend her remaining time doing all the things she never had a chance to do after she married and had her first child at seventeen.  One of those goals involves having sex with someone besides her husband and getting a man to fall in love with her.""My Life Without Me"" approaches a tricky subject with sensitivity and a minimum of sentimentality, helping the movie to steer away from the soap opera trappings of its story.  The film avoids overstating the unhappiness of Anne's life, making it clear that, while she may not exactly be living in the lap of luxury, she does have a loving husband who cares deeply about her, as well as two young girls who are obviously the apple of their mother's eye.  This makes Anne's desire to break away and find something better both more perplexing and more poignant than if her domestic life were harrowing and dismal.  With the new perspective that dying affords her, Anne begins to see how we spend our days in a futile effort to divert our attention from the reality that we will all one day die.  Anne makes recordings for all the people who have meant something to her in her life, helping them to not only cope with her death but to find some meaning and happiness in the lives they are still living.Sarah Polley gives a beautiful, heartbreaking performance as Anne, never allowing her character to become an object of pity despite the fact that she is a person being stricken down in the prime of her life.  Her restrained style is matched by that of Deborah Harry as her bitter, eternally disappointed mother, Scott Speedman as her understanding husband, Mark Ruffalo as the man with whom she falls in love, and a whole host of other superb actors.Although it veers a little too close to slick Harlequin romance at times (the too-good-to-be-true husband, the conveniently available one-true-love paramour), ""My Life Without Me"" is a subtle, heartfelt film that touches the emotions even as it gives the mind something to think about.

Calhoun ""rhymeswithorange""","[4, 4]","After being diagnosed with a rapidly-growing tumor 23-year-old Anne sits down to make a list of all the things she wants to accomplish before her death. She vows to keep her illness a secret from her family while traveling down a road of self-discovery. Besides taping several messages for her children and husband, Anne wants to fall in love and have sex with a man other than her husband who was her first love. She simply wants to live a full life from this point forward. MY LIFE WITHOUT ME is filled with heart-warming scenes of the tragedy of this one particular family. Also included are some very peculiar and nuanced characters including the hair stylist who is a devout fan of the late 1980's infamous band, Milli Vanilli, the withdrawn and lonely lover who has no furniture in his apartment, and the neurotic co-worker who is obsessed with diets and calories. Each of these characters combine to create a much more enlivened atmosphere. But despite the strengths of this film, I couldn't help being mad at Anne for not telling her family the truth. Even though she admitted in her tapes that others might find her decision to be selfish, I just couldn't accept her rationality that she didn't want to burden others with trips to the hospital, etc. If I had a family member who kept a secret like this I would be very angry and hurt (and I do have personal experience since I had a sibling who died of a terminal illness). I felt sorry for her two daughters who were never able to say goodbye. I would rather know the truth then be left in the dark and never given the opportunity to bring closure. Then, of course, Anne's decision to not seek out a second opinion or seek treatment is also worrying. Being so young she surely shouldn't have given up so fast. Who knows if a different doctor could have given her an alternative prognosis?? Although I wanted to thoroughly enjpy this film I couldn't get these feelings out of my head.

The thing is: unless you're there (with the knowledge that you'll die in two or three months), it's hard to judge. The movie worked in that it was highly charged emotionally. The acting was top-notch; Mark Ruffalo is a great young actor. The movie is well worth watching. The &quot;making of&quot; featurette wasn't that great.

But ""My life without me"" blew me away cos it was so moving. I saw lots of movies about some people who are going to die cos of some illness, but i never experienced one who was THAT touching. Though i still can't understand why the lead character refused to tell anyone of her loved ones of her tumor, i couldn't help but cry during many scenes. And just like in ""Things i never told you"",there's a laundromat scene where two people get together ( but here it plays differently than in the Lili Taylor film ). And like always, is Isabel Coixet a master of great production design which is the i - point to this great movie. One of the best Dramas ever made!!!

It was pretty difficult to sit through, even the beginning was incredibly boring. The acting was wooden, the facial expressions wooden...I really don't know where the good reviews for this film came from. All in all, I watched about 20 minutes and couldn't stand it anymore. Such a flat voice in all the acting too.Oh yeah, in the movie she makes a list of 10 things to do before she dies:1. Tell my daughters I love them several times a day.2. Find Don a new wife who the girls like.3. Record birthday messages for the girls for every year until they're 18.4. Go to Whalebay Beach together and have a big picnic.5. Smoke and drink as much as I want.6. Say what I'm thinking.7. Make love with other men to see what it's like.8. Make someone fall in love with me.9. Go and see dad in jail.10. Get some false nails (and do something with my hair).I would agree with another reviewer that this movie is unrealistic, I doubt many of those things would be on the list of someone who really was facing death. I assume the movie was trying to reach viewers in a way that would be sentimental, feeling, romantic, and provoke emotion, but really it was just boring, and flat.

The movie has a very strong life-force atmosphere that helps you end the movie without feeling crushed.The breaking of your heart does not come due to kitschy scenes but more because of the dreadful situation and the handling of it all (starting from the scene showing the ""moment of learning the truth"" which is the nightmare of any person I know).The hardest scene for me was when Ann sits in the car recording messages for her daughters birthdays. She is still very alive but you already feel the hugh absence which is always going to be felt.  The heroine is very practical and this makes the movie bearable, as if death is an issue that should be dealt with practically: it's going to arrive, and we better leave everything in order.Breaking down is also a privilige. You can afford to break down only if there is somone to pick you up. Here the breaking down will be useless, and only leave bad memories. This is how Ann feels and she therefore does not let herself break down. I can also guess that ""dying"" is Ann's very rare ""private"" thing, a space she allows to be only her own. She will do what she pleases with her ""death knowledge"" and this is probably the first thing she has done for herself, which also gives her some sense of control of the situation.A reason for sorrow are the very modest wishes Ann states and desires to accomplish before she dies. The list is so modest one is sad only to see it ---nothing of the sort of things you would imagine such as travel around the world...etc. Ann knows what she can desire. But this is exactly the power of this movie and the fact that it does not remain only in the realm of someone preparing to death but sort of gives a broader perspective of life. Ann is not a bitter person and does not blame other people, but she does have her regrets.Sarah Polley is an amazing acress and manages to deliver her difficult role without loosing her credibility.My only criticism of this movie belongs to the ""luck"" that suddenly arrives in Ann's life in the form of three very important characters who turn out to be, each and every one of them - just ""the right person in the right time"". These three people are just so right it seems a little too much...untrue. Ann, the new neighbor is just the perfect stepmother and beyond. She is someone who every mother would want for her children. Another luck is in the form of having discovered in such an early stage of her relationship with our heroine, that she is indeed the right person. The lover - another perfect person coming just at the right moment and doing exactly what he has to do. A third person is the strange, understanding doctor who is exactly what Ann needs at this point in her life.I wonder if you can call meeting these people luck, but it sure seemed to help Ann to ""die in peace"". To my regret this ""luck"" does not always arrive in the right time for most people whose  death is far from dignified. This issue seemed to do some harm to the reality and clarity of the movie. -",5,Practical pre-death arrangements,1098662400,"10 25, 2004",2004,3094,"['sad', 'movie', 'lot', 'less', 'depressing', 'then', 'expect', 'Less', 'still', 'heartbreaking', 'movie', 'very', 'strong', 'life-force', 'atmosphere', 'end', 'movie', 'feeling', 'crushed.The', 'breaking', 'heart', 'not', 'come', 'due', 'kitschy', 'scenes', 'more', 'dreadful', 'situation', 'handling', 'starting', 'scene', 'showing', 'moment', 'learning', 'truth', 'nightmare', 'person', 'know', '.The', 'hardest', 'scene', 'was', 'when', 'Ann', 'car', 'recording', 'messages', 'daughters', 'birthdays', 'still', 'very', 'alive', 'already', 'feel', 'hugh', 'absence', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'felt', 'heroine', 'very', 'practical', 'movie', 'bearable', 'death', 'issue', 'should', 'be', 'dealt', 'practically', 'going', 'arrive', 'better', 'leave', 'everything', 'order.Breaking', 'down', 'also', 'privilige', 'can', 'afford', 'break', 'down', 'only', 'somone', 'pick', 'up', 'Here', 'breaking', 'down', 'will', 'be', 'useless', 'only', 'leave', 'bad', 'memories', 'how', 'Ann', 'feels', 'therefore', 'not', 'let', 'break', 'down', 'can', 'also', 'guess', 'dying', 'Ann', 'very', 'rare', 'private', 'thing', 'space', 'be', 'only', 'own', 'will', 'do', 'what', 'death', 'knowledge', 'probably', 'first', 'thing', 'done', 'herself', 'also', 'sense', 'control', 'situation.A', 'reason', 'sorrow', 'are', 'very', 'modest', 'wishes', 'Ann', 'states', 'desires', 'accomplish', 'list', 'so', 'modest', 'one', 'sad', 'only', 'see', '-nothing', 'sort', 'things', 'would', 'imagine', 'such', 'travel', 'world', 'etc', 'Ann', 'what', 'can', 'desire', 'exactly', 'power', 'movie', 'fact', 'not', 'remain', 'only', 'realm', 'someone', 'preparing', 'death', 'sort', 'broader', 'perspective', 'life', 'Ann', 'not', 'bitter', 'person', 'not', 'blame', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'regrets.Sarah', 'Polley', 'amazing', 'acress', 'manages', 'deliver', 'difficult', 'role', 'loosing', 'credibility.My', 'only', 'criticism', 'movie', 'luck', 'suddenly', 'Ann', 'life', 'form', 'three', 'very', 'important', 'characters', 'who', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'just', 'right', 'person', 'right', 'time', 'three', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'right', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'untrue', 'Ann', 'new', 'neighbor', 'just', 'perfect', 'stepmother', 'someone', 'who', 'mother', 'would', 'want', 'children', 'luck', 'form', 'having', 'discovered', 'such', 'early', 'stage', 'relationship', 'heroine', 'indeed', 'right', 'person', 'lover', 'perfect', 'person', 'coming', 'just', 'right', 'moment', 'doing', 'exactly', 'what', 'do', 'A', 'third', 'person', 'strange', 'understanding', 'doctor', 'who', 'exactly', 'what', 'Ann', 'point', 'life.I', 'wonder', 'can', 'call', 'meeting', 'people', 'luck', 'sure', 'seemed', 'help', 'Ann', 'die', 'peace', 'regret', 'luck', 'not', 'always', 'arrive', 'right', 'time', 'most', 'people', 'death', 'far', 'dignified', 'issue', 'seemed', 'do', 'harm', 'reality', 'clarity', 'movie']",N/A
