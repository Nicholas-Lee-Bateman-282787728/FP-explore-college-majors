He is a total powerhouse performer and anyone who thinks the music at a concert should sound like the music on a record/cd should stick to those. A Concert environment is so much more energetic and exciting than a record that I wonder why you would want it to sound the same (to those complaining about not every single lyric being sung and not sung exactly in the same way as the record, come on people) Ian looks and sounds  fabulous and seems so sincerely grateful to fans for supporting the band through all these years and allowing them to do what they love.

The songs often feel a bit muted and slow, and may be improved by a speed adjustment on your DVD player.Ian seems very physically stiff and shouty, almost insecure under his huge bandana, not at all the cool raven-headed Goth-master we remember from the eighties.

Miles ""dkmiles1""","[11, 12]","Having seen the Cult 10 times over the last 16 years, I can tell you that their brand of music is difficult to replicate night after night in a live concert.  Ian's voice does not hold up well if the band plays 3 or 4 nights in a row.  This show sounds as if they were on vacation for about a week before it was recorded and they're literally at the top of their game.I've seen Ian ""mail it in"" in live concerts before, and either wuss out and not sing a difficult part, or do it haphazardly, dissapointing the loyal fan base who comes to hear his leather lunged howl.  Maybe he knew he was being recorded for the DVD, but the effort to do a good job was there.I am pleased to report, he doesn't mail it in too often in this particualr show!  ""Rain"" is excellent, he even does the ""Yeah, Yeaayyyyah yeah"" at the end of ""She Sells Sanctuary.""  The crowd is a bit subdued, but let's face it, the Cult's fan base are 30 and 40 somethings now, not exactly the kind of crowd that 'moshes.'The mix of old and new is quite good and the majority of their classics are present.

720471,A10562CQXZ5ORC,B00006LPDT,"D. Tubbs ""Les Paul Player""","[3, 9]","I have listened to The Cult for many years and enjoy many of their studio songs a lot. Ian Astbury's lyrics are often very cool, unique and strangely poignant: ""Time hustles those who wait to die."" ""You've got to bleed a little while you sing... less the words don't mean a thing."" Often they are intriguingly ambiguous-- Ciao Baby seems to be his song to/about a woman he cared deeply for but who had committed suicide. When this concept is combined with the emotion of Ian's uniquely stirring vocals and Billy Duffey's tasteful, driving Les Paul powered riffs results in a strangely romantic, very emotional song (I could be way off on the intent of this song... this sort of ambiguity has fueled some of rock music's most lasting works). I love that Billy Duffy plays a Les Paul-- the coolest rock and rock/blues guitar in the world. Now that you know I really appreciate The Cult's music... In this live performance, the vocals are not nearly as powerful and stirring as in any of the studio recordings they have produced on CD. Billy Duffey's guitar playing is very disappointing to say the least. He does however still look like a rock-and-roll stud with that Les Paul. As a 45-year-old hard rocker since my early teens, I view public profanity as a demonstration of ignorance and stupidity as well as a lack of respect for the audience. I can tolerate occasional profanities during a high-energy performance (although true rock professionals don't need them) but in this show Ian comes across as a hateful, loud mouthed, vulgar punk. I threw this DVD in the trash and am trying to forget it as I go on enjoying the awesome music they produced in the studio.",1,This DVD changed my view of the band for worse,1229040000,"12 12, 2008",2008,1664,"['have', 'listened', 'Cult', 'many', 'years', 'enjoy', 'many', 'studio', 'lot', 'Ian', 'Astbury', 'lyrics', 'are', 'often', 'very', 'cool', 'unique', 'strangely', 'poignant', 'Time', 'hustles', 'who', 'wait', 'die', ""'ve"", 'got', 'bleed', 'little', 'sing', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'thing', 'are', 'intriguingly', 'ambiguous', 'Ciao', 'Baby', 'be', 'song', 'woman', 'cared', 'deeply', 'who', 'had', 'committed', 'suicide', 'When', 'concept', 'combined', 'emotion', 'Ian', 'uniquely', 'stirring', 'vocals', 'Billy', 'Duffey', 'tasteful', 'driving', 'Les', 'Paul', 'powered', 'riffs', 'results', 'strangely', 'romantic', 'very', 'emotional', 'song', 'could', 'be', 'way', 'intent', 'song', 'sort', 'ambiguity', 'fueled', 'rock', 'music', 'most', 'lasting', 'works', 'love', 'Billy', 'Duffy', 'Les', 'Paul', 'coolest', 'rock', 'rock/blues', 'guitar', 'world', 'Now', 'know', 'really', 'appreciate', 'Cult', 'music', 'live', 'performance', 'vocals', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'powerful', 'stirring', 'studio', 'recordings', 'have', 'produced', 'CD', 'Billy', 'Duffey', 'guitar', 'playing', 'very', 'disappointing', 'say', 'least', 'however', 'still', 'look', 'rock-and-roll', 'stud', 'Les', 'Paul', '45-year-old', 'hard', 'rocker', 'early', 'teens', 'view', 'public', 'profanity', 'demonstration', 'ignorance', 'stupidity', 'as', 'well', 'lack', 'respect', 'audience', 'can', 'tolerate', 'occasional', 'profanities', 'high-energy', 'performance', 'true', 'rock', 'professionals', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'show', 'Ian', 'across', 'hateful', 'loud', 'mouthed', 'vulgar', 'punk', 'threw', 'DVD', 'trash', 'am', 'trying', 'forget', 'go', 'enjoying', 'awesome', 'music', 'produced', 'studio']",The Cult: Live Cult
