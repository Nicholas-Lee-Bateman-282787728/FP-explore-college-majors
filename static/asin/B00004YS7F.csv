Jasper Rains,"[18, 22]","Okay let me start by correcting another writer that the book in the Bible that the movie is based on is called &quot;REVELATION&quot; not &quot;REVELATIONS&quot; as the writer called it! There! Now that this is off my chest let's talk about this film. Most movies put out by Christians are tacky and cheesy (i.e., Judas Project, Thief In The Night series, Appocalypse). This movie however has strong performances and a decent script. Kirk Cameron is a lot better than I had expected as Buck. The suspense is there and I think they did a good job of setting up the storyline. I had not read the series prior to the movie and I thought it was very easy to follow. Viewing the film actually inspired me to read all the other Left Behind series books. Though they have their faults, I do believe that future films would be great! I think this movie lacked all cheesiness that is so frequent in other films of this genre and I do believe that God will use it for His glory. I reccommend it strongly.

560095,A1A4DEENGHK51T,B00004YS7F,Alan Attebery,"[4, 4]","On a crowded New York to London flight, Captain Rayford Steele (Brad Johnson) was thinking about his flight attendant Hattie Durham (Chelsea Noble), while she was thinking about her new upcoming job at the United Nations. Cameron ""Buck"" Williams (Kirk Cameron) was taking a nap after finishing some research on his laptop. None of them knew that they were about to be thrust into the worst nightmare of their lives: The Rapture.Based on the first book of the hugely successful ""Left Behind"" novel series, this movie gives us a glimpse of what life will be like for those left behind after the rapture. There have been many reviews written over the years giving this movie poor reviews for the sole reason that it is not as good as the book. And it is nowhere near as good as the book. But then again, what movie is? Short of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, I'm hard pressed to think of any.You will need to largely forget about the book when watching this (or any) movie. Although not at all perfect, ""Left Behind - The Movie"" is a gripping story that will force you to think. Not too many movies can really do that.After the rapture, Buck, Captain Steele, his daughter Chloe (Janaya Stephens), and former faux-pastor Bruce Barnes (Clarence Gilyard Jr.) will each look for answers to the disappearances. The answers they find will intertwine their lives together in a way none of them could have imagined. But will they understand the meaning of those answers in time? They better, because the Antichrist has come to power in the form of Nicolae Carpathia (played perfectly by Gordon Currie). And if he has anything to say about it, everyone on Earth will bow before him.There are problems with the movie. In the beginning, the script is noticeably weak and all the actors seem uncomfortable in their roles. It almost feels like the actors were each cast that morning and filming that night. However, as the movie continues the script gets stronger and the message gets louder. When the rapture does finally occur, the scenes of clothes and jewelry left exactly where a person would have been are chilling.This side of ""The Passion of the Christ,"" this movie is one of the best looking Christian movies ever made. It is worth checking out, even if it doesn't match the book.",4,The Beginning of the End,1115337600,"05 6, 2005",2005,2275,"['crowded', 'New', 'York', 'London', 'flight', 'Captain', 'Rayford', 'Steele', 'Brad', 'Johnson', 'was', 'thinking', 'flight', 'attendant', 'Hattie', 'Durham', 'Chelsea', 'Noble', 'was', 'thinking', 'new', 'upcoming', 'job', 'United', 'Nations', 'Cameron', 'Buck', 'Williams', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'was', 'taking', 'nap', 'finishing', 'research', 'laptop', 'None', 'knew', 'were', 'be', 'thrust', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'lives', 'Rapture.Based', 'first', 'book', 'hugely', 'successful', 'Left', 'Behind', 'novel', 'series', 'movie', 'glimpse', 'what', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'behind', 'rapture', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'reviews', 'written', 'years', 'giving', 'movie', 'poor', 'reviews', 'sole', 'reason', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'book', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'book', 'then', 'again', 'what', 'movie', 'Short', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', ""'m"", 'hard', 'pressed', 'think', 'any.You', 'will', 'need', 'largely', 'forget', 'book', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'not', 'perfect', 'Left', 'Behind', 'Movie', 'gripping', 'story', 'will', 'force', 'think', 'Not', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'can', 'really', 'do', 'that.After', 'rapture', 'Buck', 'Captain', 'Steele', 'daughter', 'Chloe', 'Janaya', 'Stephens', 'former', 'faux-pastor', 'Bruce', 'Barnes', 'Clarence', 'Gilyard', 'Jr.', 'will', 'look', 'answers', 'disappearances', 'answers', 'find', 'will', 'intertwine', 'lives', 'together', 'way', 'none', 'could', 'have', 'imagined', 'will', 'understand', 'meaning', 'answers', 'time', 'better', 'Antichrist', 'come', 'power', 'form', 'Nicolae', 'Carpathia', 'played', 'perfectly', 'Gordon', 'Currie', 'anything', 'say', 'everyone', 'Earth', 'will', 'bow', 'him.There', 'are', 'problems', 'movie', 'beginning', 'script', 'noticeably', 'weak', 'actors', 'seem', 'uncomfortable', 'roles', 'almost', 'feels', 'actors', 'were', 'cast', 'morning', 'filming', 'night', 'However', 'movie', 'script', 'stronger', 'message', 'louder', 'When', 'rapture', 'finally', 'occur', 'scenes', 'clothes', 'jewelry', 'left', 'exactly', 'where', 'person', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'chilling.This', 'side', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'looking', 'Christian', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'even', ""n't"", 'match', 'book']",N/A

There are also small parts that are very interesting and well done, like Pastor Bruce Barnes (Clarence Gilyard Jr.), the only one in his church who is &quot;left behind&quot;, and Dirk Burton (Jack Lanedijk), whose ideas are often dismissed as &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;.Gordon Currie is perfect as Nicolae Carpathia, the anti-christ; he is the kind of man that would become an overnight media star, with his half-truths and lies gobbled up as The New Gospel.As Pastor Barnes says, &quot;knowing and believing are two different things&quot;. This film will help you figure out what you know and what you believe.With fast-paced direction by Vic Sarin, a tight and often witty script based on the Lahaye / Jenkins bestseller, good cinematography (George Jiri Tirl) and effects, and a most enjoyable score by James Covell, watching this movie is time well spent, something I find quite rare these days.This is a low-buget movie that deserves 5 stars, not because it is a masterpiece, but because in its unpretentious way, it delivers, and on many levels; it will feed your brain, feed your soul, and at the same time, be fun to watch.

What will the final battles be like? Who are the ""two prophets"" who will return? And what is Elijah's return,anyhow?""Left Behind"" leaves all these big questions behind in favor of a hackneyed plot about the Rapture, two conversions, and the rise of the Antichrist. Ironically,though this movie is ""all about Jesus"" and ""bringing people to Jesus"",Jesus comes across as a deus ex machina of sorts,a plot device,not an actual person. The story involves Rayford Steele,a pilot who has been cheating on his wife with a beautiful stewardess,an ungodly member of the Mile High Club when his wife&kids; get swept into Heaven. Kirk Cameron,former child star,stars as Buck Williams, a liberal reporter of the godless media. Buck is reporting on the miracle of Israeli agriculture when he witnesses the Rapture (an elderly woman's husband leaves his clothes behind in the airplane bathroom) and an attack on Israel mysteriously averted. Rayford Steele converts when he realizes his raptured wife was a Bible believer. Buck has a conversion experience in a bathroom (I don't know why.It seems tasteless,but that's what happens) In the end,Buck finds out that the evil Nicolae Carpathia is the Antichrist and new head of the UN. Nicolae is a very weak villain;his mentor basically tells him what to do,playing the Emperor to his Darth Vader.

560102,A1WB5NZYY5XR8A,B00004YS7F,"Ash1138 ""Just a middle aged guy living in Col...","[6, 7]","The Movie: * (1 star for its poor quality storytelling)The Book: **** (4 stars for its enjoyment and message)Why do screenwriters so often seem to be unable to transpose a work of fiction from the written medium to the big screen? Many argue that it's necessary in order to fit so much detail into a two hour movie. The fact that many larger novels have successfully been adapted to the big screen certainly doesn't help to explain why such a light book [Left Behind] was so poorly crammed into a one and a half hour presentation.By no means will I claim Left Behind is some sort of masterpiece from a literary standpoint, but I will say it was a great read. The movie on the otherhand was rather disappointing. I won't say I was disappointed because of the poor special effects, bad acting, or even poor directing (though this film has all three). I went in expecting it. I will say I was disappointed because the story just wasn't there.There are many differences between the book and the movie; some small, some large. A few small examples are: Rayford kissing Hattie (leading you to assume he's having an affair; Buck never going to the UK; etc.. Some of the big examples are: the book starts on Rayfords flight about one hour before the disappearances (chapter 1) while the movie doesn't even reach chapter one until at least 20 minutes into the film (that's pretty big considering the film is only 90 minutes long); in the movie all four main characters conveniently know each other before hand; Carpathia is portrayed as a sinister individual pretty early completely detracting from the point that the false prophet will be someone everyone loves and trusts; the book never makes mention of these mysterious 10 tracks of land or bankrupting the U.N.; everyone jumps on the believer bandwagon pretty much instantly without any inner conflict; I could go on..My point is that the book makes a good dramatazation of what life might be like after the rapture (if it indeed happens the way it's presented). The writers do a good job at presenting various psychologies and creating fictional testimonies. The people in this book (believers and non-believers alike) seem real and believable. The events (so far) stay consistant with those found in the bible (even though the rapture is a vague concept to begin with and much debated). But the movie doesn't capture the message of the book. It is chopped up and brief. The characters are two dimensional with no appearant motivations. The villans/conflicts seem to exist with no reason/explanation. I can't see how watching this film without having read the book would allow you to take much away from it.If you read the book, you'll probably really enjoy it (unless you let the whole christian thing get in your way, in which case you probably wouldn't read it in the first place). After that if you're like me you'll want to see the movie just out of curiosity. If you do this, you'll at least be able to fill in a lot of the missing parts with what you know from the book (even if you are annoyed by how much they really did unnecessarily change the story around).",1,"By all means, read the book first!",982800000,"02 22, 2001",2001,3116,"['Movie', '*', '1', 'star', 'poor', 'quality', 'storytelling', 'Book', '****', '4', 'stars', 'enjoyment', 'message', 'Why', 'do', 'screenwriters', 'so', 'often', 'seem', 'be', 'unable', 'transpose', 'work', 'fiction', 'written', 'medium', 'big', 'screen', 'Many', 'argue', 'necessary', 'order', 'fit', 'so', 'much', 'detail', 'two', 'hour', 'movie', 'fact', 'many', 'larger', 'novels', 'have', 'successfully', 'been', 'adapted', 'big', 'screen', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'help', 'explain', 'why', 'such', 'light', 'book', '[', 'Left', 'Behind', ']', 'was', 'so', 'poorly', 'crammed', 'one', 'half', 'hour', 'presentation.By', 'means', 'will', 'claim', 'Left', 'Behind', 'sort', 'masterpiece', 'literary', 'standpoint', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'great', 'read', 'movie', 'otherhand', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'poor', 'special', 'effects', 'bad', 'acting', 'even', 'poor', 'directing', 'film', 'three', 'went', 'expecting', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'story', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'are', 'many', 'differences', 'book', 'movie', 'small', 'large', 'few', 'small', 'examples', 'are', 'Rayford', 'kissing', 'Hattie', 'leading', 'assume', 'having', 'affair', 'Buck', 'never', 'going', 'UK', 'big', 'examples', 'are', 'book', 'Rayfords', 'flight', 'one', 'hour', 'disappearances', 'chapter', '1', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'reach', 'chapter', 'one', 'least', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'pretty', 'big', 'considering', 'film', 'only', '90', 'minutes', 'long', 'movie', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'conveniently', 'know', 'other', 'hand', 'Carpathia', 'portrayed', 'sinister', 'individual', 'pretty', 'early', 'completely', 'detracting', 'point', 'false', 'prophet', 'will', 'be', 'someone', 'everyone', 'loves', 'trusts', 'book', 'never', 'mention', 'mysterious', '10', 'tracks', 'land', 'bankrupting', 'U.N.', 'everyone', 'believer', 'bandwagon', 'pretty', 'much', 'instantly', 'inner', 'conflict', 'could', 'go', 'on..My', 'point', 'book', 'good', 'dramatazation', 'what', 'life', 'might', 'be', 'rapture', 'indeed', 'way', 'presented', 'writers', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'presenting', 'various', 'psychologies', 'creating', 'fictional', 'testimonies', 'people', 'book', 'believers', 'non-believers', 'alike', 'seem', 'real', 'believable', 'events', 'so', 'far', 'stay', 'consistant', 'found', 'bible', 'even', 'rapture', 'vague', 'concept', 'begin', 'much', 'debated', 'movie', ""n't"", 'capture', 'message', 'book', 'chopped', 'up', 'brief', 'characters', 'are', 'two', 'dimensional', 'appearant', 'motivations', 'villans/conflicts', 'seem', 'exist', 'reason/explanation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'watching', 'film', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'would', 'allow', 'take', 'much', 'away', 'it.If', 'read', 'book', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'really', 'enjoy', 'let', 'whole', 'christian', 'thing', 'get', 'way', 'case', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'read', 'first', 'place', ""'re"", ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'just', 'curiosity', 'do', ""'ll"", 'least', 'be', 'able', 'fill', 'lot', 'missing', 'parts', 'what', 'know', 'book', 'even', 'are', 'annoyed', 'how', 'much', 'really', 'did', 'unnecessarily', 'change', 'story', 'around']",N/A
560103,A3SEPNBSUYNO92,B00004YS7F,Brendan,"[9, 10]","It seems like most people give a film 5 stars just because they really like the movie. But only a film that stands out as one of the best films ever made actually deserves 5 stars. Left Behind has earned every single one of them. I'm not just saying this because I'm a Christian or because it has the Left Behind name on it. If I wasn't a Christian, I'm sure I would still love the movie and learn from it.  I do not think there is anything in the film that can be criticized. I have noticed that some reviewers have attacked its special effects and low budget. The special effects are not impressive but it doesn't matter. Usually when a film's success depends on special effects, you get a mediocre script and acting. Be thankful that this didn't happen to Left Behind.I think Chuck Anziulewicz's point of view was very interesting but I totally disagree with it and anyone else with a similar opinion. He implied that Left Behind was fictional. Of course  that is not true. The movie even said so. If this movie and the Bible does not convince you then what will? What if the event portrayed in the movie were to happen next week (it is very possible)? You would be left behind just like Buck, Rayford, Chloe, and Bruce. Do you want to risk that? Chuck's review sounded just like Buck before he was changed in the movie. I probably sound like I am &quot;slapping you over the head&quot; but why wait?Now back to the movie. Left Behind really lives up to the book. The story has been switched around a little bit but it doesn't hurt the movie. The plot and climax are still the same.  I had never heard of any of the actors except for Kirk Cameron until now but they all do a great job. All the characters act almost exactly as I imagined them while reading the book.

It has haunted me all my life.Having said that, I'm really surprised at the number of - 1 Star - ratings this movie has received.

From the very first chapter of the first volume, it took hold of me, and has not let go since.  I devoured the first three volumes in less than two weeks, and I'm very much looking forward to immersing myself in the rest of the story.  No doubt you've at least heard of the bestselling series about life during the end times of the world, and now, as is so often the trend, comes the movie.  After I read the first novel, I was very interested in seeing the film version, even though my gut told me it probably wouldn't be nearly as good.  I should've followed.  Don't get me wrong; it's not all bad.  The movie delivers a powerful message and makes a decent effort at summarizing the events in the book in an hour and a half.  But that's pretty much where the lauds end and the critic in me takes over.  It's great when you can enjoy the movie and follow the plot even if you haven't read the book.  It's not exactly a prerequisite to read &quot;Left Behind&quot; first, but it sure helps.  You'll understand the main message clearly enough, but to understand the action &quot;behind the scenes&quot;, like the Antichrist's methods of rising to power, you have to know the supporting characters better than how they're portrayed in the film.  The special effects were average at best, and the action and intensity that makes the book series so compelling is all but missing here.  The acting itself was for the most part decent, but in some cases, I almost wanted to laugh out loud.  Kirk Cameron does turn in a good performance as Buck Williams, and Brad Johnson is a dead-on Ray Steele (if a teeny bit stiff).  All said, though, it seems that the main reason this movie was made was to get people to buy the book.  If the crew had had a bigger budget, and had made the film longer, I think it would have been a lot better.  The biggest shock for me, though, was that the authors of the book series appeared absolutely nowhere in the credits.  You'd think they'd have had at least a finger in production, which I think would've made a world of difference as well.  To put a period on this, if you're going to spend the money, it'd be much better spent on the first four books in the series.",2,"It serves a purpose, but...",979603200,"01 16, 2001",2001,2316,"['question', 'quot', 'Left', 'Behind', 'quot', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'book', 'series', 'ever', 'created', 'good', 'reason', 'very', 'first', 'chapter', 'first', 'volume', 'took', 'hold', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'devoured', 'first', 'three', 'volumes', 'less', 'two', 'weeks', ""'m"", 'very', 'much', 'looking', 'forward', 'immersing', 'rest', 'story', 'doubt', ""'ve"", 'least', 'heard', 'bestselling', 'series', 'life', 'end', 'times', 'world', 'now', 'so', 'often', 'trend', 'movie', 'read', 'first', 'novel', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'seeing', 'film', 'version', 'even', 'gut', 'told', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'should', ""'ve"", 'followed', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'powerful', 'message', 'decent', 'effort', 'summarizing', 'events', 'book', 'hour', 'half', 'pretty', 'much', 'where', 'lauds', 'end', 'critic', 'great', 'when', 'can', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'follow', 'plot', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'not', 'exactly', 'prerequisite', 'read', 'quot', 'Left', 'Behind', 'quot', 'first', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'main', 'message', 'clearly', 'enough', 'understand', 'action', 'quot', 'scenes', 'quot', 'Antichrist', 'methods', 'rising', 'power', 'have', 'know', 'supporting', 'characters', 'better', 'how', ""'re"", 'portrayed', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'average', 'best', 'action', 'intensity', 'book', 'series', 'compelling', 'missing', 'here', 'acting', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'decent', 'cases', 'almost', 'wanted', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'turn', 'good', 'performance', 'Buck', 'Williams', 'Brad', 'Johnson', 'dead-on', 'Ray', 'Steele', 'teeny', 'bit', 'stiff', 'said', 'main', 'reason', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'get', 'people', 'buy', 'book', 'crew', 'had', 'had', 'bigger', 'budget', 'had', 'made', 'film', 'longer', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'biggest', 'shock', 'though', 'was', 'authors', 'book', 'series', 'appeared', 'absolutely', 'nowhere', 'credits', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'have', 'had', 'least', 'finger', 'production', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'world', 'difference', 'as', 'well', 'put', 'period', ""'re"", 'going', 'spend', 'money', ""'d"", 'be', 'much', 'better', 'spent', 'first', 'four', 'books', 'series']",N/A

Jenkins, chose for the roles of the people featured in the books.  A lot of the cast and crew in the movie looked like what I had expected.This movie does not pick up all key points that were in the book and viewers not reading the book wouldn't know a couple details that were left out of the movie.  (They wouldn't have made a difference if you knew them or not.)Overall, I enjoyed this movie for its quality content and the suspensful scenes added in here and there.  Though it is only a 90 minute flick, &quot;Left Behind&quot; is still in my top ten movies list and people I have talked to enjoyed it also.I guarentee this movie will be loved by all and anyone who buys it will be guaranteed a winner.I can tell that the makers of the film took time and effort in the making of this film and deserve a thumbs up in such a great performance.

As a story, the premise has a lot of promise; as a movie, it runs a bit slow and has weak production values. Overall, however, I would still recommend the film to anyone who needs a decent family film to watch.Overall, the film is good, but I was hoping for something more. To be perfectly fair, it is much better than most Christian genre, low budget movies that have come out over the past few years. The acting, overall, is good, and the special effects, for the most part, are authentic. As such, this one rates about the same as movies like the Omega Code: great for a Christian movie / about average for movies in general.One of the difficulties I had with the movie was the inability to suspend belief. As a film and video major, it was easy to spot that the camera Buck (Kirk Cameron) uses in the desert has no 'live' capabilities, yet is used for a live broadcast. I also had a lot of problem with the staged accident scene after the rapture.Unfortunately, this is how the rest of the movie plays out as well. To be fair, most people will not recognize these mistakes. And, it certainly isn't any worse than the rest of the tripe that Hollywood has pounded over the past few years.One area that I was hoping would be better was the production values of the film. This film suffers from the same plague that most low budget films suffer from. As this could be the video transfer, I will use the discount coupons to see the film in the movie theater when it comes out before passing judgement.If I were asked if I would recommend this film, I would have to say yes.

The engaging element shown is when passengers at 37,000 feet in the air start to realise that their family members who were on board with them on the flight can no longer be accounted for. Only their clothes and personal effects can be found. Panic ensues on the plane. However, when they land, it is discovered that the situation is a global event. I find that this event was well portrayed.Persons of non-Pentecostal beliefs may be offended by this movie, because they do not believe in the Rapture, or what the scriptures have to say about it. So don't be misled by ravenous bad reviews of this film. They simply do not believe, nor understand.Storyline:The storyline unfolds on two fronts:[1] The turmoil experienced by a family as half is left behind (father/pilot and daughter) and the other half has been raptured (mother/wife and son).[2] The Beast coming into power as the Secretary General of the United Nations. Nicolae Carpathia (Gordon Currie) portrays the part quite well. Key GNN reporter Buck Williams (Kirk Cameron) tries to thread the events together as he collects key information from different sources including the Bible.Conclusion:This film can be a good avenue to help tell others about the Rapture and how soon it will really take place.

Munson,"[0, 3]","Based on the best-selling book of the same title, ""Left Behind"" looks at the events of the rapture which is told in the book of Revelation.  The movie centers around the lives of Buck Williams, played by Kirk Cameron, and Rayford Steele, played by Brad Johnson.  Rayford is a commerical airline pilot on his way from New York to London, and Buck is a reporter for GNN, a world-wide news agency, who happens to be on Rayford's flight.  Suddenly, people begin to turn up missing.  All that is left is their clothes, jewelry, etc.  No trace of the people can be found.After landing at O'Hare in Chicago, Rayford learns the sad fact that his wife and son are part of the missing.  Rayford often felt strange when his wife was talking about events in the Bible, but now he's wondering if she had been right about things.  He finally begins to read his wife's Bible, and soon he realizes the truth; the rapture has indeed occured.  Still filled with grief, Rayford, along with Bruce Barnes, the assistant pastor of the local church who was also left behind, both accept Christ into their lives.Meanwhile, Nicolae Carpathia, played by Gordon Currie, has taken control of the United Nations and has promised to restore world order.  Many see him as a savior, but Bruce and some others know him for who he really is.  Buck has been witnessed to by Rayford and Bruce, but he still has some doubts.  He is summoned to the United Nations to cover a Carpathia press conference and he then discovers that everything Bruce and Rayford had been telling him is true.  He then accepts God into his life.  Nicolae manages to brainwash everyone at the press conference except for Buck, who knows the real truth of what really happened.I enjoyed this movie a great deal.  Having read each book in the series, I was pleased to see that the movie followed the book so closely.  The acting is very good, and the stroyline really makes the viewer think.

I was bracing myself to see a shakily-filmed movie with a bunch of wooden actors spouting off dispensationalist dogma but it really wasn't like that at all. To be sure, the obsequiousness towards the Israelis was distasteful, its theology inane, and I can't claim that this movie is good enough to ever watch again, but it wasn't as bad as I feared. I was actually surprised by the production value and the actors wouldn't have been out of place in a mainstream movie. Mercifully, the religious agitprop, although central to the plot, played second fiddle to the mystery and suspense. Of course, this film, and the book it was based on, originates with the 19th century made-up doctrine of the Rapture, which makes anything related to ""Left Behind"" a good candidate for the trash can. This kind of religious science fiction would be just as diverting as any other kind of fantasy if so many millions didn't accept its un-Biblical doctrines as Gospel truth and voted accordingly.

The main characters are Buck Williams, a television reporter and Rayford Steele, an airline pilot.  While they are on the job, millions disappear from the Earth.  Every possible explanation is explored until gradually people realize that this is the event which is foretold in the Bible.  Rayford mourns the loss of his wife and son and eventually sees that their faith is what separates them from him.  Nicolae Carpathia is introduced and we see his coversion from good-guy head of the UN, an encourager of peace, to a maniacal killer and power seeker.  We also see Buck and Rayford's conversion from Christianity which is shown in a believable way.  This is reputed to be a low budget film which may explain the lack of a lot of special effects.

It was not just a normal Christian book, it was an entertaining novel with interesting characters on the brink of the end of the world. The book had everything the mass market wanted: sex and violence. This film takes the book and deletes the exciting qualities and changes it to create a nonviolent, preachy flick that could only appeal to the most hardcore in the Christian subculture. It is an abomination and embarrasment to its source novel. Where the book appealed to everyone, this film only targets those born-again Christian fanatics that want to watch this kind of stuff. The violence is kept to a minimum, something the book didn't do. There is no sexual content, something the book had. Most of all, there is Kirk Cameron, a mild actor who does better on syndicated sitcoms than in what is supposed to be an action-drama. He plays Buck Williams who is a reporter who gets left behind and soon he converts to Christ because he'll follow Satan if he doesn't, or at least that's what this movie wants us to believe. This film is constantly on its soapbox, never pausing to develop any sort of coherent story or characters to care for. At the end of the film, Kirk Cameron suggests, almost begs, for the viewer to recommend this film to friends and make posters and pamphlets getting people to watch this.

Great plot structure, well-developed characters, and a convincing cast make Left Behind: The Movie a film worth seeing.Left Behind opens with this saying: ""How does one describe both a beginning and an end? We should have known better, but we didn't. What does it matter what we think we know? In the end, there's no denying the Truth."" That saying perfectly sets the tone for the entire movie, and, without a doubt, for the entire series.The storyline concerns four individuals who acknowledge Jesus with their lips, but in truth they don't believe in the Gospel message of God's salvation. Then, the most catastrophic event in the history of mankind occurs: millions of people all over the world have vanished; disappeared in the twinkling of an eye, all at the exact same moment. World-wide chaos, anarchy, and devastation strike the planet. Those who remain on Earth find themselves desperately seeking for answers. Among them, the four non-believers, Cameron ""Buck"" Williams (Kirk Cameron) airline pilot Rayford Steele (Brad Johnson) his daughter, Chloe Steele (Janaya Stephens) and Bruce Barnes (Clarance Gilyard).The four of them eventually meet up with each other in the midst of their searching for the truth behind the vanishings. Together they discover the Truth: God Almighty took His followers to Heaven to live with Him forever. The four left-behinds become post-rapture Christians dedicated to live for Christ, and preparing themselves to try to survive the most chaotic and deadly years the planet has ever known: the final seven years of Earth, known as the Tribulation . . .As said before, Left Behind is a film definitely worth seeing. The one minor quibble is this: Director Vic Sarin, in creating this movie, has attempted to seamlessly blend action and suspense with the Gospel message. However, the blend of action/suspense and the Gospel message is not seamless. To me, it is part action flick, and part religious message. The film would have been better if the blend had been more seamless. The second film in the series, Tribulation Force, is better in this respect.

560160,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,B00004YS7F,Robert Blake,"[4, 5]","First, I did really enjoy the original &quot;Left Behind&quot; novel, which I found to be very exciting, well-written and filled with powerful, sometimes touching moments, one of this best novels based on Biblical themes I have ever read. So, I was interested to see how Cloud Ten Pictures would adapt the novel. Alas, this is a boring, unclear and badly-acted movie that never generates interest or suspense. Now, some may say the book is too big, I say this is a wrong assumption because longer movies have been made from shorter novels and have come out really bad. &quot;Left Behind&quot; in fact, could have worked  as a 3-hour production because it has been proven that great 3 hour movies seem even too short (&quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Gladiator&quot; come to mind as well as &quot;The Insider&quot;). I think the problem with this movie is the same I see with most Cloud Ten Productions, these guys don't care about making serious movies, they just show their desperation in trying to compete with the big-budget studio pictures. And they can't because I have seen that all their movies care less about really exploring Biblical themes and more about shoot-outs and cheesy special effects. Secular films like &quot;The Exorcist&quot; and even &quot;Stigmata&quot; seem like more serious undertakings (and they are. &quot;The Exorcist&quot; being a masterpiece). In fact, I viewed &quot;The Making Of Left Behind&quot; and was disappointed to hear an air-headed producer exclaim, &quot;if there isn't an explosion, then it's not a movie,&quot; how stupid is that? Now for examining the movie's content as a whole: This movie is never clear or focused. People who know nothing about Christian theology as taught in groups like Catholics, Baptists etc., will walk out of this movie confused, having not really learned anything. The acting is lame, when the actors are not unconvincing, they are over-acting. This is also a boring movie, which seems much longer than it is. A lot of the good stuff from the book was cut out, like the forming romance between the reporter and pilot's daughter. And it lacks the epic tones the novel deserves. If Cloud Ten really wants to make a name for itself, then they better start thinking harder. Another example of their lack of thought is that they released this movie on video BEFORE releasing it in theaters where it didn't even make the top 10. I really don't keep track of religious-based movies or books, but I was recommended the &quot;Left Behind&quot; novel by a friend and I know a good story when I see one, and this is a good story that still is searching for a proper screen adaptation.",1,Terrible Adaptation.,996796800,"08 3, 2001",2001,2645,"['First', 'did', 'really', 'enjoy', 'original', 'quot', 'Left', 'Behind', 'quot', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'exciting', 'well-written', 'filled', 'powerful', 'sometimes', 'touching', 'moments', 'one', 'best', 'novels', 'based', 'Biblical', 'themes', 'have', 'ever', 'read', 'So', 'was', 'interested', 'see', 'how', 'Cloud', 'Ten', 'Pictures', 'would', 'adapt', 'novel', 'Alas', 'boring', 'unclear', 'badly-acted', 'movie', 'never', 'interest', 'suspense', 'Now', 'may', 'say', 'book', 'too', 'big', 'say', 'wrong', 'assumption', 'longer', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'shorter', 'novels', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'really', 'bad', 'quot', 'Left', 'Behind', 'quot', 'fact', 'could', 'have', 'worked', '3-hour', 'production', 'been', 'proven', 'great', '3', 'hour', 'movies', 'seem', 'even', 'too', 'short', 'quot', 'Titanic', 'quot', 'quot', 'Gladiator', 'quot', 'come', 'mind', 'as', 'well', 'quot', 'Insider', 'quot', 'think', 'problem', 'movie', 'same', 'see', 'most', 'Cloud', 'Ten', 'Productions', 'guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'making', 'serious', 'movies', 'just', 'show', 'desperation', 'trying', 'compete', 'big-budget', 'studio', 'pictures', 'ca', ""n't"", 'because', 'have', 'seen', 'movies', 'care', 'less', 'really', 'exploring', 'Biblical', 'themes', 'more', 'shoot-outs', 'cheesy', 'special', 'effects', 'Secular', 'films', 'quot', 'Exorcist', 'quot', 'even', 'quot', 'Stigmata', 'quot', 'seem', 'more', 'serious', 'undertakings', 'are', 'quot', 'Exorcist', 'quot', 'being', 'masterpiece', 'fact', 'viewed', 'quot', 'Making', 'Left', 'Behind', 'quot', 'was', 'disappointed', 'hear', 'air-headed', 'producer', 'exclaim', 'quot', ""n't"", 'explosion', 'then', 'not', 'movie', 'quot', 'how', 'stupid', 'Now', 'examining', 'movie', 'content', 'whole', 'movie', 'never', 'clear', 'focused', 'People', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'Christian', 'theology', 'taught', 'groups', 'Catholics', 'Baptists', 'etc.', 'will', 'walk', 'movie', 'confused', 'having', 'not', 'really', 'learned', 'anything', 'acting', 'lame', 'when', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'unconvincing', 'are', 'over-acting', 'also', 'boring', 'movie', 'much', 'longer', 'lot', 'good', 'stuff', 'book', 'was', 'cut', 'out', 'forming', 'romance', 'reporter', 'pilot', 'daughter', 'epic', 'novel', 'deserves', 'Cloud', 'Ten', 'really', 'make', 'name', 'then', 'better', 'start', 'thinking', 'harder', 'example', 'lack', 'thought', 'released', 'movie', 'video', 'releasing', 'theaters', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'top', '10', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'keep', 'track', 'religious-based', 'movies', 'books', 'was', 'recommended', 'quot', 'Left', 'Behind', 'quot', 'novel', 'friend', 'know', 'good', 'story', 'when', 'see', 'one', 'good', 'story', 'still', 'searching', 'proper', 'screen', 'adaptation']",N/A

Why do I say this?  Well, my first problem with the movie is the theology: it is simply unbiblical and dangerous.  I challenge anyone to give a good, clear description of how the rapture and all that goes along with it are what the Bible says.  Where does it say that all the Christians will be &quot;snatched&quot; away to leave those who are &quot;Left Behind&quot; to suffer the wrath of God.  And to what purpose?  Have they already not been punished for being Left Behind?  Jesus asks, &quot;When the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?&quot; - why ask this if he knows that no one who is Christian is there?  Rapture theology is dangerous by being a new fear tactic of spreading the gospel and, well...bad theology!On to other things...the acting, as many have said, is atrocious, though true to writing style of the book.  Cameron is probably the best, though that should be expected, given that he has the most experience.The movie plods along and is virtually unbearable to watch - and I am glad that I only saw it in video format.  If I paid a big-screen price, I would want my money back!Now many Christians who read this will think badly of me for being so negative; but if the movie is so good, why are Cloud Ten Productions trying to get churches to put up money to get this movie on the screen?  If it is so good, why can't it stand on its own?  Once again, this is an example of how Christians are embarrassing in how they accept anything just because a &quot;Christian&quot; label is put on it and supports their own theology.

We get so hung up on our intellectual high-horse that we fail to distinguish between the two very different mediums of literature and film.
