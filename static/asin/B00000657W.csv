493051,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B00000657W,Andre Dursin,"[2, 2]","Robert Redford's 1969 film DOWNHILL RACER is a film that its admirers have long desired to see on DVD, and understandably so: director Michael Ritchie, Redford (who produced the film and came up with its concept), and writer James Salter fashioned a taut, economically-told portrait of a skier named David Cappellet, whose single-minded desire to achieve success on the U.S. ski team fuels his ego-centric behavior.Atmospherically shot in a pseudo-documentary style on location in Europe -- in some of the most renowned Alpine locales in Austria, France and Switzerland -- ""Downhill Racer"" is both a product of its time and a still-relevant commentary on the nature of the modern athlete. As Redford himself discusses in the disc's supplements, winning truly is everything in this country -- so much that it can provide an excuse for abhorrent behavior. It's not that Redford's character in ""Downhill Racer"" is intensely dislikeable (at least not when compared to some of the completely off-putting professional athletes we see today), but he is a cipher whose motives are individualistic and internal. Winning, to him, seems to be the only thing guiding him forward, even though his coach (Gene Hackman) attempts to balance his behavior with his Gold-medal potential talent.It's an interesting film with fine, early performances from the likes of Redford and Hackman (a young Dabney Coleman also essays one of Redford's fellow team members), not to mention superb cinematography that captures the essence of Alpine skiing circa the late `60s, when live sports coverage was just beginning to affirm its place in the broadcast spectrum and men like David Chappellet were on the cusp of turning into international sports heroes.Criterion's DVD of this 1969 Paramount release includes a fine 16:9 (1.85) transfer along with mono sound and a number of extras: new video interviews with Redford, Salter, editor Richard Harris and other members of the production team; audio excerpts from a 1977 AFI seminar with the late Michael Ritchie; a rare promotional featurette entitled ""How Fast?""; the trailer; and booklet notes from Variety critic Todd McCarthy.",5,"Uncompromising, Moody Redford-Ritchie Gem",1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,2150,"['Robert', 'Redford', '1969', 'film', 'DOWNHILL', 'RACER', 'film', 'admirers', 'have', 'long', 'desired', 'see', 'DVD', 'understandably', 'so', 'director', 'Michael', 'Ritchie', 'Redford', 'who', 'produced', 'film', 'came', 'up', 'concept', 'writer', 'James', 'Salter', 'fashioned', 'taut', 'economically-told', 'portrait', 'skier', 'named', 'David', 'Cappellet', 'single-minded', 'desire', 'achieve', 'success', 'U.S.', 'ski', 'team', 'fuels', 'ego-centric', 'behavior.Atmospherically', 'shot', 'pseudo-documentary', 'style', 'location', 'Europe', 'most', 'renowned', 'Alpine', 'locales', 'Austria', 'France', 'Switzerland', 'Downhill', 'Racer', 'product', 'time', 'still-relevant', 'commentary', 'nature', 'modern', 'athlete', 'Redford', 'disc', 'supplements', 'winning', 'truly', 'everything', 'country', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'provide', 'excuse', 'abhorrent', 'behavior', 'not', 'Redford', 'character', 'Downhill', 'Racer', 'intensely', 'dislikeable', 'least', 'not', 'when', 'compared', 'completely', 'off-putting', 'professional', 'athletes', 'see', 'today', 'cipher', 'motives', 'are', 'individualistic', 'internal', 'Winning', 'be', 'only', 'thing', 'guiding', 'forward', 'even', 'coach', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'balance', 'behavior', 'Gold-medal', 'potential', 'talent.It', 'interesting', 'film', 'fine', 'early', 'performances', 'likes', 'Redford', 'Hackman', 'young', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'also', 'one', 'Redford', 'fellow', 'team', 'members', 'not', 'mention', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'essence', 'Alpine', 'skiing', 'circa', 'late', '60s', 'when', 'live', 'sports', 'coverage', 'was', 'just', 'beginning', 'affirm', 'place', 'broadcast', 'spectrum', 'men', 'David', 'Chappellet', 'were', 'cusp', 'turning', 'international', 'sports', 'heroes.Criterion', 'DVD', '1969', 'Paramount', 'release', 'fine', '16:9', '1.85', 'transfer', 'mono', 'sound', 'number', 'extras', 'new', 'video', 'interviews', 'Redford', 'Salter', 'editor', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'other', 'members', 'production', 'team', 'audio', 'excerpts', '1977', 'AFI', 'seminar', 'late', 'Michael', 'Ritchie', 'rare', 'promotional', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'How', 'Fast', 'trailer', 'booklet', 'notes', 'Variety', 'critic', 'Todd', 'McCarthy']",Downhill Racer VHS

493054,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00000657W,Doug Anderson,"[16, 17]","This film caught my attention immediately because of the writer, James Salter, so I was surprised at how little dialogue or actual talking goes on. Its one of the most physical films I've ever seen which is certainly appropriate given the subject matter, downhill ski racing. Redford came to this fresh off of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid but he looks much younger without the moustache. The topic of ski competition is exciting and fun as most of the film takes place on the mountain with great ski footage or in ski lodges in Europe which are romantic to say the least. Also attractive is Redfords European girlfriend. She gives the film another dimension completely as the embodiment of the experienced and scrupulous European versus the innocent and clumsy(and socially naive)American. Gene Hackman as the coach is absolutely great as he tries to instill more than just athletic virtues into his team members. There are also scenes of Redford, the rising star of the team, visiting home in the American midwest somewhere which I suppose tells us both why winning is so important to him and why he is so clumsy socially. Its not a perfect film( the midwest scenes seem a little too simplistic for such an otherwise smart and uncliched film)  but one that tells a great sort of story rare in 69 in that it puts forth a value system instead of knocking one down. Redford has called the film an examination of American ideals about success. It is that. The ski scenes capture the excitement of the sport, and the hotel scenes capture the rewards given to success. But success in sport as in all fields is fleeting and you best enjoy the prize while at the top because if you finish second you are nobody again and all the rewards vanish as quickly as they were given. Effective cutting technique throughout the film emphasizes the ruthless pace and nature of a life forged in the heat of competition. Redford is caught surprise by the transient nature of this life. But the film has a great sort of ethic being put forth, that being that in a world where everything can be gained or lost in a split second one must not focus so keenly on the prize immediately at stake that one loses sight of those things which sustain us through both ups and downs, ie friends, coach, Dad, old girlfriend, dog.",5,Loneliness of the Downhill American Ski Champ,1010620800,"01 10, 2002",2002,2301,"['film', 'caught', 'attention', 'immediately', 'writer', 'James', 'Salter', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'little', 'dialogue', 'actual', 'talking', 'one', 'most', 'physical', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'certainly', 'appropriate', 'given', 'subject', 'matter', 'downhill', 'ski', 'racing', 'Redford', 'came', 'fresh', 'off', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'much', 'younger', 'moustache', 'topic', 'ski', 'competition', 'exciting', 'fun', 'most', 'film', 'place', 'mountain', 'great', 'ski', 'footage', 'ski', 'lodges', 'Europe', 'are', 'romantic', 'say', 'least', 'Also', 'attractive', 'Redfords', 'European', 'girlfriend', 'film', 'dimension', 'completely', 'embodiment', 'experienced', 'scrupulous', 'European', 'versus', 'innocent', 'clumsy', 'socially', 'naive', 'American', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'coach', 'absolutely', 'great', 'instill', 'more', 'just', 'athletic', 'virtues', 'team', 'members', 'are', 'also', 'scenes', 'Redford', 'rising', 'star', 'team', 'visiting', 'home', 'American', 'midwest', 'somewhere', 'suppose', 'tells', 'why', 'winning', 'so', 'important', 'why', 'so', 'clumsy', 'socially', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'midwest', 'seem', 'little', 'too', 'simplistic', 'such', 'otherwise', 'smart', 'uncliched', 'film', 'one', 'great', 'sort', 'story', 'rare', '69', 'value', 'system', 'instead', 'knocking', 'one', 'down', 'Redford', 'called', 'film', 'examination', 'American', 'ideals', 'success', 'ski', 'scenes', 'capture', 'excitement', 'sport', 'hotel', 'capture', 'rewards', 'given', 'success', 'success', 'sport', 'fields', 'fleeting', 'best', 'enjoy', 'prize', 'top', 'finish', 'second', 'are', 'nobody', 'again', 'rewards', 'vanish', 'as', 'quickly', 'were', 'given', 'Effective', 'cutting', 'technique', 'film', 'ruthless', 'pace', 'nature', 'life', 'forged', 'heat', 'competition', 'Redford', 'caught', 'surprise', 'transient', 'nature', 'life', 'film', 'great', 'sort', 'ethic', 'being', 'put', 'forth', 'being', 'world', 'where', 'everything', 'can', 'be', 'gained', 'lost', 'split', 'second', 'one', 'must', 'not', 'focus', 'so', 'keenly', 'prize', 'immediately', 'stake', 'one', 'sight', 'things', 'sustain', 'ups', 'downs', 'ie', 'friends', 'coach', 'Dad', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'dog']",Downhill Racer VHS

Richards ""econ1955""","[3, 3]","Dating from 1969, Downhill Racer holds up remarkably well both as a character study and a visually impressive journey into the world of Olympic skiing.  Robert Redford, in the title role, plays an egotistical loner aiming for Olympic Gold.  Coming from a background of rural poverty, he is fiercely determined to achieve fame and fortune.  Often abrasive and laconic, he is openly contemptuous of people who lack his ambition, and resentful of those who have been born to wealth.  Gene Hackman provides an interesting foil, recognizing his ability, but manipulating him for his own purposes.  All this plays out against a background of lofty mountain scenery and high-speed ski runs.  There is something very legitimate about the characterizations here: the implicit subtext is that success requires both relentless perseverance and an element of cold-bloodedness.",4,Cold ambition,1352764800,"11 13, 2012",2012,864,"['Dating', '1969', 'Downhill', 'Racer', 'up', 'remarkably', 'well', 'character', 'study', 'visually', 'impressive', 'journey', 'world', 'Olympic', 'skiing', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'title', 'role', 'egotistical', 'loner', 'aiming', 'Olympic', 'Gold', 'Coming', 'background', 'rural', 'poverty', 'fiercely', 'determined', 'achieve', 'fame', 'fortune', 'Often', 'abrasive', 'laconic', 'openly', 'contemptuous', 'people', 'who', 'lack', 'ambition', 'resentful', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'born', 'wealth', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'interesting', 'foil', 'recognizing', 'ability', 'manipulating', 'own', 'purposes', 'out', 'background', 'lofty', 'mountain', 'scenery', 'high-speed', 'ski', 'runs', 'something', 'very', 'legitimate', 'characterizations', 'here', 'implicit', 'subtext', 'success', 'relentless', 'perseverance', 'element', 'cold-bloodedness']",Downhill Racer VHS

493057,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,B00000657W,L.A. Scene,"[6, 11]","When it comes to Robert Redford, I am a huge fan.  Redford is very famous for his role as Roy Hobbs in ""The Natural"" - a movie that many consider one of the greatest Baseball movies of all-time.  What many people don't realize is that earlier in his career Redford did another sports film - this one dealt with downhill skiing.  This movie is simply titled ""Downhill Racer"".  This movie is a very different movie than ""The Natural"".  Although from a plot standpoint, it is not as compelling as ""The Natural"", ""Downhill Racer"" does come across very well as a pure Sports movie.  The movie also features Gene Hackman as Coach Eugene Clair - the U.S. Olympic Downhill Skiing coach.The best way to sum up ""Downhill Racer"" is that it is a combination of a Docudrama and a Drama.  Even though this is a fictitious story, the movie very much comes across as a docudrama.  The Docudrama part chronicles the three year career of fictitious skier David Chappellet  (played by Robert Redford).  It chronicles the story of when Chappellet  first joins the U.S. Ski Team and then follows his career as he becomes a rising star on the Ski Circuit in Europe - climaxing with a Downhill Event in the Olympics.  This part of the movie is very well-done.  As you watch this chronicling, you will almost believe that this is a biographical story.Redford really brings the an edge to his character of David Chappellet.  Chappellet is character who is cocky and reckless.  Chappellet arrives in Europe to the U.S. Ski Team as a fill-in for an injured teammate.  Chappellet will immediately display a brashness when he is upset about getting a poor draw in the start gate (when he hasn't even proven himself).  Redford is able to deliver this brashness flawlessly.  Hackman's performance actually was somewhat a disappointment.  There is really only one scene where Hackman comes down on Chappellet for his rebel character.  While the character of Coach Clair does a good job in portraying himself as the U.S. Ski Coach, I would have liked to have seen better interaction with Chappellet throughout the film.This film was directed by Michael Ritchie.  Up until this movie, Ritchie's work had been primarily on television.  This film would mark the beginning of a very successful motion picture directing career.  Ritchie does a great job at translating Oakley Hall and James Salter's script and painting a picture of realism of the Ski Circuit.  This is how the film almost has a Docudrama effect.  The Ski scenes are phenomenal.  There are scenes when a camera is mounted to a skier and it gives the effect of what the skier is looking at as he goes down the hill in a race.The film does a great job at looking at Americas role on the World Ski Circuit.  The film points out that this traditionally a sport that Americans have not done well in.  There are references to why the Americans have not been as competitive in this sport (i.e. due to lack of sponsorship, funding, and good equipment).  The movie raises the question on whether Downhill Racing is a Team or Individual Sport.  Coach Clair is quick to point out that it is a team concept because of the costs the sponsors incur in funding the team.  However one of Chappellet's teammates (played by a young Dabney Coleman) quickly points out that there are times that Skiing isn't exactly a team sport.  The movie also raises the issue of Professional vs. Amateur Athletics.  When Chappellet returns home to visit his aluft father, his father questions why anyone would want to compete if they don't get paid. (This goes back to the days when the Olympics were really considered an amateur competition).  This also comes up again at the Olympics when Chappellet is repeatedly asked what he is going to do after the Olympics (referring to the obvious financial rewards that could follow).As part of the view of the team, there is an interesting subplot that develops.  When Chappellet arrives on the team, there is a U.S. Skiing hope named Johnny Creech who is considered the rising star of the team.  As Chappellet becomes a rising star, a rivalry develops between the two skiers.  There are definitely times that Creech doesn't appreciate Chappellet's brashness.  As the two head for the Olympics, the rivalry begins comes to a climax.  Eventually it is Chappellet who will become the Skier that will have the Olympic showdown with Europe's top skier - Max Meier.The final scene takes place at the Olympics.  There is a very interesting twist at the end of the movie involving who gets the Gold Medal.  Just when we think who won the Meier-Chappellet showdown, there is a wildcard thrown in where a third skier comes into play on who will get the Gold Medal.  I liked how this was done.There are some other disappointments the lack of interaction with Chappellet and the Coach.  The weakest part of the film involves a Romance Storyline.  While in his second year on the U.S. Ski Team, Chappellet develops a budding romance with an employee of a ski manufacturer named Carole Stahl (played by Camilla Sparv).  It almost seemed like they forced the Romance angle in this movie - and the movie could have probably held its own without even introducing Carole's character. I would also liked to have seen the plot involving Chappellet's father have a little more done with it.  Chappellet definitely didn't have a strong relationship with his father - and it was clear his father didn't approve of what his son did.  I would have liked to have seen some closure involving this relationship.  Instead we are kept hanging with this subplot.Overall, if I look at this movie from the Docudrama standpoint, I find it to be better than if I look at this as a Drama about Skiing.  It is definitely worth checking out.",3,Almost like a Sking Docudrama - but some weak points,1110672000,"03 13, 2005",2005,5744,"['When', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Redford', 'very',

If you love skiing this is for you, but having missed the first 10 minutes of it on TV just now, the rest of the film did not add up to even five minutes TOTAL of dialogue from HIM.  A total social misfit, not even knowing how to form a SENTENCE with a woman.  I found it so sad to see My Redford in such a role.... it was so depressing.  After sex in his car, she asked him his opinion of where she should go visit on a rrip [some quiestion like that, describing both alternatives] and all he could say was &#34;I don't know, have any more of that gum?&#34;  That was the EXTENT OF THEIR WHOLE CONVERSATION!!!  He was totally disinterested in ANYTHING, nor any human contact except sexually then pants up and back to business getting rid of them as fast as he could, at least liking the second one a LITTLE more, maybe saying TWO words to HER.... then her dumping HIM, getting right out of the car when he shut HER up from talking by pushing the car horn!!

493060,A24GLNOGCWICTP,B00000657W,Neil Cotiaux,"[7, 7]","The opening sequence of ""Downhill Racer"" gets the adrenalin flowing - plenty of softly photographed downhill action accompanied the crisp jazz notes of composer Kenyon Hopkins' first-rate score. Then the film settles down to a pace befitting its core: a quiet study of a loner, exhibiting strained relations with most everyone around him, as he develops the zone he intends to maintain for victory.In this somewhat contrarian role on the heels of his charming ""Sundance Kid"" performance, a still-emerging Robert Redford plays effectively off Gene Hackman in a thoughtful and interesting exploration of what makes a winning athlete tick and whether ""teamwork"" is always relevant to winning. Redford's visit to his hometown is a bit unsettling; one can feel the tenseness between father and son and the uncomfortableness of a young man who is not really ""home"" at all. The same low-lying tension permeates the other quiet scenes in and around team headquarters, which makes the actual competition - punctuated by Hopkins' buoyant score - all the more breathtaking.Director Ritchie, who also worked with Redford in ""The Candidate"", knew how to get the most out of shooting his star's facial expressions, which deepen the feel of unease throughout much of ""Downhill Racer"", and that artful camerawork is put to excellent use in the film's finale.This is a film worth a second look.",5,Understated Study of a Loner,1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,1377,"['opening', 'sequence', 'Downhill', 'Racer', 'adrenalin', 'flowing', 'plenty', 'softly', 'photographed', 'downhill', 'action', 'accompanied', 'crisp', 'jazz', 'notes', 'composer', 'Kenyon', 'Hopkins', 'first-rate', 'score', 'Then', 'film', 'down', 'pace', 'befitting', 'core', 'quiet', 'study', 'loner', 'exhibiting', 'strained', 'relations', 'most', 'everyone', 'zone', 'maintain', 'victory.In', 'somewhat', 'contrarian', 'role', 'heels', 'charming', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'performance', 'still-emerging', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'effectively', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'thoughtful', 'interesting', 'exploration', 'what', 'winning', 'athlete', 'tick', 'teamwork', 'always', 'relevant', 'winning', 'Redford', 'visit', 'hometown', 'bit', 'unsettling', 'one', 'can', 'feel', 'tenseness', 'father', 'son', 'uncomfortableness', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'really', 'home', 'same', 'low-lying', 'tension', 'other', 'quiet', 'scenes', 'team', 'headquarters', 'actual', 'competition', 'punctuated', 'Hopkins', 'buoyant', 'score', 'more', 'breathtaking.Director', 'Ritchie', 'who', 'also', 'worked', 'Redford', 'Candidate', 'knew', 'how', 'get', 'most', 'shooting', 'star', 'facial', 'expressions', 'deepen', 'feel', 'unease', 'much', 'Downhill', 'Racer', 'artful', 'camerawork', 'put', 'excellent', 'use', 'film', 'finale.This', 'film', 'second', 'look']",Downhill Racer VHS
493061,A2198O25QYUPXE,B00000657W,Nicholas R.W. Henning,"[1, 1]","""Downhill Racer"" is a sport/racing genre film with skiing at the centre of the narrative.Considering the era the movie was made in (1969), with no computer generated images and little in the way of special effects, good old fashion active camera work provides the viewer with plenty of adrenalin.Protagonist and Olympic hopeful Dave Chappellet (Robert Redford) puts the ""I"" in team driven by his desire to be the best, and with little regard to picking up and putting down whatever he needs to get there. Team coach Eugene Claire (Gene Hackman) finds Chappellet difficult to manage and tries several ways to rein him in, but it seems victory is the only language he understands.This film presents a fantastic opportunity to see Redford and Hackman at an earlier stage in their careers and seeing their acting in a pure state.The score/soundtrack to the movie was made at a time when popular songs were seldom used and tunes were carefully crafted to stimulate emotion.It's a film which encourages the viewer to strive for greatness and be a bit ruthless about it too.Nicholas R.W.

Gene Hackman co-stars as the coach who tries to temper Chappellet's narcissistic and reckless drive for glory.""Downhill Racer"" came out late in 1969 hot on the heels of Redford's success with ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."" Unfortunately it wasn't marketed properly and failed at the box office, but don't let that deter you 'cause this is a great film well worthy of your time.Although the movie is from '69 and therefore has obvious dated aspects, ""Downhill Racer"" was very innovative in it's time and holds up amazingly well to this day. In fact, aside from the ski paraphernalia, I don't find the film dated at all. It somehow has a fresh quality and plays out like a docudrama similar to, say, ""Saving Private Ryan,"" which was made nigh three decades later(!).""Downhill Racer"" is reminiscent of 1966's ""The Blue Max"" in that both films are about an unlikable loner who is ruthlessly ambitious in his area of skill and functions as a fish out of water in the social circles to which he's thrust. It goes without saying that if you liked ""The Blue Max"" you'll probably like this one too. Both rank with my favorite films of all time.Downhill racing is an insanely hazardous sport in that the skier can reach speeds of 80-90 mph(!). Needless to say, one bad fall could take you out for life. Downhill is also an extremely individualistic sport, which is well pointed out in the story when a teammate criticizes Chappellet for not being a team player and another guy responds, ""Well, it isn't exactly a team sport, is it?"" Needless to say, it takes a very certain kind of individual to be successful at downhill -- someone who's ultra-daring and bold; someone with a wild, reckless edge balanced by the necessary discipline to train and compete. Redford effectively plays such a person here. He rises up in the ranks to become the American team's only true hopeful; the coach attempts to somewhat keep him under reigns and criticizes his individualism and recklessness even while he knows these are the very qualities that makes him a winner. Throughout the picture Chappellet and the coach act like they don't like each other at all, and it's true because Chappellet is a loner in the truest sense, but ultimately the coach is squarely on the young racer's side: When it comes time for the vital Olympic run the coach looks into Chappellet's eyes and confidently states, ""You can win this.""Take note of the stark contrast of Chappellet's plain hometown in Colorado and the glitz of the European ski resorts where he races. Also contasted is Chappellet's throw-away hometown girl (""Do ya have some more of that gum"" -- LOL) and the glamorous self-absorbed babe he hooks up with in Europe (Camilla Sparv of ""Mackenna's Gold"" fame); she gives him a good taste of his own bad self, if you know what I mean. Also of interest is his 'relationship' with his distant father, a simple country man who doesn't understand his son's preoccupation with skiing and the lack of financial gain thereof.While watching I couldn't help but think of Bill Johnson, the unlikely downhill gold medal winner for the USA in the '84 Olympics. Like Chappellet he was cocky & reckless and irked the European snobs with his bold predictions of Olympic victory. I have no doubt that ""Downhill Racer"" was one of Bill's favorite films. Unfortunately Mr. Johnson staged an improbable comeback bid for the 2002 Olympics that ended abruptly with a horrible downhill crash in March, 2001, leaving him permanently brain-damaged and in need of constant care. How the mighty have fallen!One cavil I have with ""Downhill Racer"" is that Redford is playing a person in his early 20s while he was 32 years-old during filming and looks it.
