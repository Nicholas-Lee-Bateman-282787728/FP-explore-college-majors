A ""killer cabinet"" . . . a master thief . . . a handsome leading man in William Lundigan and the great addition of Paul Cavanagh who (whom?) many may be familiar with from his appearances in a couple of the ""Sherlock Holmes"" series with Basil Rathbone.  Since this is from the Warner Bros Archive series, you will need a DVD play-only or Blu-Ray player to view.

First, it is a well-done  ""who-done-it"" and the denouement is surprising. I didn't guess it. It was based on a stage play which usually is a good indication of quality. But my main source of pleasure is in seeing a very young and very handsome William Lundigan. He is truly beautiful in this picture and a fine actor as well. For Lundigan fans, this picture is a  ""sine qua non"".  As far as the technical quality is concerned, I think everything - the video and audio are fine.
