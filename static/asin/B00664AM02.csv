It is a study of age and change and loss; the man in particular has never recovered from the the breakup of this relationship.

1510854,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00664AM02,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 1]","THE SONG OF LUNCH (2010, dir. Niall MacCormick) stars Alan Rickman as ""He"" and Emma Thompson as ""She"". ""He"" is a semi-lecherous, washed-up old poet with one sad book published. ""She"" is his old flame, his muse, now happily married to a successful author. They meet for lunch in an old haunt; apparently ""He"" wishes to try to get away with something. Poet Christopher Reid dashed this off, as a poem, and apparently it caught someone's attention and here we are.This is a Masterpiece Modern Classic production (or whatever they call those) - I'm normally not too enthralled by what I've been seeing there. Masterpiece Mystery, Masterpiece Classic of course, any day. The only thing that can save this recitation of lousy poetry is the presence of two legendary stars, all-time favorites of mine and my wife's.What saves this movie is the pair of powerhouse performances by the two great stars, and some occasionally funny lines (my favorite expression of Reid's is ""restaurant semaphore"" to describe how we call the wait staff). It is all a quiet, mostly two-star show set in a little restaurant. The funniest thing for me was seeing Emma's real-life husband, the handsome Greg Wise (Sense and Sensibility,Cranford), making his cameo appearance as 'Her' husband ... in a photo on the back of his ""newest book"".I emphasize: it takes power, skill and discipline especially for Emma, because she is an outsider watching Alan Rickman have an internal dialogue/meltdown in verse. Not truly horrid verse, mind you, but I've read - and yes, I have occasionally written - much better. They make it work, the setting is good, it's all of about 42 minutes and so I shall call it an attempt at 'eccentric old-school classic'. If you are an Anglophile, a fan of the stars (HOW CAN YOU NOT BE??), even if you're just into weird short films, this is for you.I can't say I'll ever stoop to adding it to my collection, much as I love the stars. I can get as much by reading Reid's original poem. It does hearten me that production companies are trying this sort of thing - very art-house - but I read someplace the real reason.Money's tight all over, and I suppose Emma and Alan still have bills to pay....",3,At least I didn't lose mine ....,1321142400,"11 13, 2011",2011,2189,"['SONG', 'OF', 'LUNCH', '2010', 'dir', 'Niall', 'MacCormick', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'semi-lecherous', 'washed-up', 'old', 'poet', 'one', 'sad', 'book', 'published', 'old', 'flame', 'muse', 'now', 'happily', 'married', 'successful', 'author', 'meet', 'lunch', 'old', 'haunt', 'apparently', 'try', 'get', 'away', 'something', 'Poet', 'Christopher', 'Reid', 'dashed', 'off', 'poem', 'apparently', 'caught', 'someone', 'attention', 'here', 'are.This', 'Masterpiece', 'Modern', 'Classic', 'production', 'call', ""'m"", 'normally', 'not', 'too', 'enthralled', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'seeing', 'there', 'Masterpiece', 'Mystery', 'Masterpiece', 'Classic', 'course', 'day', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'save', 'recitation', 'lousy', 'poetry', 'presence', 'two', 'legendary', 'stars', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'mine', 'movie', 'pair', 'powerhouse', 'performances', 'two', 'great', 'stars', 'occasionally', 'funny', 'lines', 'favorite', 'expression', 'Reid', 'restaurant', 'semaphore', 'describe', 'how', 'call', 'wait', 'staff', 'quiet', 'mostly', 'two-star', 'show', 'set', 'little', 'restaurant', 'funniest', 'thing', 'was', 'seeing', 'Emma', 'real-life', 'husband', 'handsome', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Cranford', 'making', 'cameo', 'appearance', ""'Her"", 'husband', 'photo', 'back', 'newest', 'book', '.I', 'emphasize', 'power', 'skill', 'discipline', 'especially', 'Emma', 'outsider', 'watching', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'have', 'internal', 'dialogue/meltdown', 'verse', 'Not', 'truly', 'horrid', 'verse', 'mind', ""'ve"", 'read', 'yes', 'have', 'occasionally', 'written', 'much', 'better', 'make', 'work', 'setting', 'good', '42', 'minutes', 'so', 'shall', 'call', 'attempt', ""'eccentric"", 'old-school', 'classic', 'are', 'Anglophile', 'fan', 'stars', 'HOW', 'CAN', 'YOU', 'NOT', 'BE', 'even', ""'re"", 'just', 'weird', 'short', 'films', 'you.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'stoop', 'adding', 'collection', 'much', 'love', 'stars', 'can', 'get', 'as', 'much', 'reading', 'Reid', 'original', 'poem', 'hearten', 'production', 'companies', 'are', 'trying', 'sort', 'thing', 'very', 'art-house', 'read', 'someplace', 'real', 'reason.Money', 'tight', 'suppose', 'Emma', 'Alan', 'still', 'have', 'bills', 'pay']",The Song of Lunch

Or, if you're a fan of actors Alan Rickman or Emma Thompson, who play the two principal characters - referred to only as ""he"" and ""she"" - ex-lovers who meet for lunch for the first time in 15 years, you'll probably delight in their sublime, nuanced performances.However, while I enjoyed watching two distinguished artists ply their craft, I just couldn't warm to the ""he"" character becuz, as a bitter, effete, lecherous, alcoholic boor, he was very unsympathetic and - even worse - a cliche (esp since he's a failed poet/writer).

1510859,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00664AM02,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[83, 84]","The Masterpiece Contemporary interpretation of Christopher Reid's narrative poem ""Song of Lunch"" is one of those stagings that you don't see very often on television. It's an intimate chamber piece, something that might be produced as a one-act play as it is largely the internal musings of one man. And, truthfully, you'll either appreciate the film's quiet lyricism and heartbreak or you will be utterly uninterested in its slight drama. Under the Masterpiece mantle, we've come to appreciate huge literary adaptations and other forms of spectacle--so ""Song of Lunch"" works as almost a experimental bit of theater (an anti-production, if you will). This difference is why I liked the brief 50 minute presentation. Of course, I was expecting more of a character exchange (as I assume most people would be) along the lines of ""My Dinner With Andre"" or the recent ""The Trip."" I mean, after all, if you have Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson at your disposal--you'd think this would be an acting tour-de-force. But the star here is the words, the poem.Rickman plays a struggling editor who yearns to reconnect to a time in his life where he felt more alive, more impassioned. He has this idealized version of a past romance that he clings to as a symbol of youth and possibilities. The fact that the object of his affection has established a life (complete with husband and family) doesn't really seem to click with him. After 15 years, he sets up a lunch with Thompson and he has constructed this elaborate scenario about the way it will turn out. Other than this, you don't get a lot of back story about the characters. The lunch itself becomes a painful exercise in awkwardness, as the rather unpleasant Rickman descends into belligerence and an alcoholic haze. The actual dialogue is tight with some amusing lines, but most of the drama takes place in Rickman's mind. In many ways, Thompson becomes just another prop to support the narrative of Rickman's ramblings and failed expectations.There is an underlying sadness and melancholia infused throughout the piece. Rickman, seemingly dissatisfied with life, makes a last ditch effort to revive a happier time. But the effort, as we all know it will be, is a futile one. But the elements of living life when you have the chance and not dwelling on regrets really does resonate. Interestingly, Rickman is NOT a particularly sympathetic character. This is certain to turn some viewers off. But it is precisely his unpleasantness that makes his quiet desperation so palpable. It's a great performance, though most of it in voice over. Thompson is the picture of loveliness. It's always great to see her, but she doesn't have too much to do. In the end, your expectations about what ""Song of Lunch"" should be will decide whether it is for you. It is a simple and evocative depiction of a narrative poem, not a fully plotted character piece. It may not be for everyone, but I think it succeeds at what it attempts to convey.

The couple hasn't seen each other for fifteen years.  She is now a wife and mother, living in Paris, married to a successful writer, while Rickman, having failed in his artistic endeavors, detests his low level position at the publishing house where he works.The reunion does not go well from the start.  Not only has the restaurant changed from what Rickman remembers, but also once Emma arrives, he begins to over indulge in the grape and his attitude becomes surly.Director Niall MacCormick has done a fine job of keeping this low-key drama engrossing and seemingly unconfined, not an easy feat since most of the action is set in the restaurant at a small corner table.  And, of course, Rickman and Ms. Thompson are nothing short of brilliant in their roles.THE SONG OF LUNCH is on DVD from BBC Video. Michael B.

It is a film of love lost.Alan Richman plays 'He', no names mentioned. He is an editor and sometimes poet. He has arranged for a meeting with an old flame, and it turns out, 'She', played by Emma Thompson, left him for someone else. He does most of the narration, telling his tale, a sodden tale it seems. He plans the lunch at an old restaruant they used to inhabit, and he relives the days of yore down to the tablecloths and the owner. It turns out eveything has changed, as it is wont to do after 15 years. Strike this as a real negative for him. He starts drinking as soon as he sits down. It appears that liquid meals are his style. She comes in the door, much better looking and dressed than he remembers. In his mind he starts reliving the memories of her. She has to bring him back to the present several times.""He"" however, is stuck in his own mind. As the drinking resumes she makes the statement that he is ""out to lunch at your own lunch"". That pretty well sums it up. He is very frustrating, you want to kick him or slap his face. We have all met people like this, and it is often that the alcohol brings out their worst side. He is not a likeable person, and he keeps talking. I wanted to say to him, ""shut up and let her talk."" She has a lot to say and most of it is 'right on'. She remembers correctly and after this lunch she must be thankful that she did not end up with him.We have a portrait of this couple, the lives they had together and the lives they lead now. She knows him well and tells him that his poetry is not his therapy. It is quite apparent that he needs the latter. He is an insufferable prig from my viewpoint, and I wonder how the rest of his life will evolve. The film's camerawork is superb. It is the faces and the expressions of these two that convey most of the story. Memories are made of this, it seems.Recommended. prisrob 11-14-11Sense and Sensibility: The Screenplay and Diaries (Newmarket Shooting Script)Fork It Over : The Intrepid Adventures of a Professional Eater",4,Out To Lunch At Your Own Lunch,1321228800,"11 14, 2011",2011,2090,"[""'Song"", 'Lunch', 'short', 'BBC', 'film', 'brought', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'film', 'love', 'lost.Alan', 'Richman', ""'He"", 'names', 'mentioned', 'editor', 'sometimes', 'poet', 'arranged', 'meeting', 'old', 'flame', 'out', 'played', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'left', 'someone', 'else', 'most', 'narration', 'telling', 'tale', 'sodden', 'tale', 'lunch', 'old', 'restaruant', 'used', 'inhabit', 'days', 'yore', 'tablecloths', 'owner', 'out', 'eveything', 'changed', 'wont', 'do', '15', 'years', 'Strike', 'real', 'negative', 'drinking', 'as', 'soon', 'down', 'liquid', 'meals', 'are', 'style', 'door', 'much', 'better', 'looking', 'dressed', 'mind', 'reliving', 'memories', 'bring', 'back', 'present', 'several', 'times', 'however', 'stuck', 'own', 'mind', 'drinking', 'statement', 'lunch', 'own', 'lunch', 'pretty', 'well', 'sums', 'up', 'very', 'frustrating', 'want', 'kick', 'slap', 'face', 'have', 'met', 'people', 'often', 'alcohol', 'out', 'worst', 'side', 'not', 'likeable', 'person', 'talking', 'wanted', 'say', 'shut', 'up', 'let', 'talk', 'lot', 'say', 'most', ""'right"", 'correctly', 'lunch', 'must', 'be', 'thankful', 'did', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'him.We', 'have', 'portrait', 'couple', 'lives', 'had', 'together', 'lives', 'lead', 'now', 'well', 'poetry', 'not', 'therapy', 'quite', 'apparent', 'latter', 'insufferable', 'prig', 'viewpoint', 'wonder', 'how', 'rest', 'life', 'will', 'evolve', 'film', 'camerawork', 'superb', 'expressions', 'two', 'convey', 'most', 'story', 'Memories', 'are', 'made', 'seems.Recommended', 'prisrob', '11-14-11Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Screenplay', 'Diaries', 'Newmarket', 'Shooting', 'Script', 'Fork', 'Intrepid', 'Adventures', 'Professional', 'Eater']",The Song of Lunch
1510870,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B00664AM02,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[2, 2]","This movie is really written for TV.  Perhaps an hour or less long, it is a kind of poetic storytelling that only two great actors like Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman can pull through.Two former lovers decide to meet for lunch after not seeing each other for nearly 15 years.  In this movie they are nameless.  He is an editor living a mundane life that is boring both professionally and personally.  He is a failed writer who never published anything after his first book of poetry failed to find readers on the market.  She on the other hand, is happily married to a well known, bestselling author and lives in Paris. As their lunch progresses it becomes obvious that ""he"" is on the loosing end of this reunion.  Their mutual reflection on their former relationship seems to shed the kind of light that is different for each one of them.  It is a story with deep emotion that has a very good message - for every love there is a time and place.  Love must be nurtured and protected from the outsiders, because ""muses"" and ""princes (of death/a metaphor)"" are meant to test it. And when test like that happens to any couple it typically brings victory to the one that was wronged and the other has the eternity to reflect on it with endless remorse and regret about the missed opportunity for happiness and fulfillment.  What is in the past is past.  Life moves on.  Everything else ends or dies.Wonderful, witty dialogue that two character actors (Thomson and Rickman) bring to a sober end.
