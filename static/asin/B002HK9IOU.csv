Ferrari,"[22, 23]","Luckily my local retailer shelved this item a week early so I already have it.The stunts and clips on this are really some of the best the show had to offer and it was nothing short of tragic that they were left off of the boxed set.  I am of the opinion that the boxed set was really poorly done in that it should have been episodic rather than just 3 conglomerations of edited down stunts and skits.That being said I am really glad that some of these gems are finally on DVD.  The original ""Satan vs. God"" is presented in all its uncensored (read unbleeped) glory.  Knoxville breaking his ankle trying to jump the ""LA river"" on rollerskates is included and uncensored.  ""Self Defense Test""  ""Milk Challenge"".  All are slices of fried gold.  The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars from me is that this material should have been released on the boxed set.Bottom line is if you are a fan This is an absolute MUST have to complete the series.",4,Should have been on the boxed set,1255046400,"10 9, 2009",2009,942,"['Luckily', 'local', 'retailer', 'shelved', 'item', 'week', 'early', 'so', 'already', 'have', 'it.The', 'stunts', 'clips', 'are', 'really', 'best', 'show', 'had', 'offer', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'tragic', 'were', 'left', 'boxed', 'set', 'am', 'opinion', 'boxed', 'set', 'was', 'really', 'poorly', 'done', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'episodic', 'rather', 'just', '3', 'conglomerations', 'edited', 'stunts', 'skits.That', 'being', 'said', 'am', 'really', 'glad', 'gems', 'are', 'finally', 'DVD', 'original', 'Satan', 'vs.', 'God', 'presented', 'uncensored', 'read', 'unbleeped', 'glory', 'Knoxville', 'breaking', 'ankle', 'trying', 'jump', 'LA', 'river', 'rollerskates', 'included', 'uncensored', 'Self', 'Defense', 'Test', 'Milk', 'Challenge', 'are', 'slices', 'fried', 'gold', 'only', 'reason', ""n't"", 'get', '5', 'stars', 'material', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'boxed', 'set.Bottom', 'line', 'are', 'fan', 'absolute', 'MUST', 'have', 'complete', 'series']",N/A
1268652,ALTNI5BAFUAQY,B002HK9IOU,"Jery Tillotson ""cult author""","[2, 21]","The Jackass franchise is dead.In this mind-numbing collage of snippets and out takes from earlier segments, you're treated to endless scenes of non-stop vomitting, people having bowel movements and--oh, you know, the usual things that we just can'tlive without. I fast-forwarded most of this junk and closed my eyes during all the vomitting and bowel movements scenes.You know this is a Jackass Production because everytime a scene is shown, there is wild, screams of hysterical laughing. Yoc can easily imagine the old gang of aging pranksters to be rolling around on the ground in helpless hysteria. Too bad the viewer isn't doing the same thing.None of these scenes were deemed worthy enough to include in the original programs and they're grade Z garbage to be included here.My very favorite bad boy, Chris Pontius, was given very little to do. I could watch him all day.What was really outrageous is that MTV included all these scenes of bodily functions graphically with nothing hidden.Yet, when some of the guys were photographed from behind with their naked tushes on display, the cleft division was digitally hidden! How crazy is that? Would showing their butt crack turned us all into raving lunatics? Or shocked us? It'd be so great that one day we could see our favorite badboys--especially Chris--completly nude.",1,Scraping the Bottom,1269648000,"03 27, 2010",2010,1325,"['Jackass', 'franchise', 'dead.In', 'mind-numbing', 'collage', 'snippets', 'out', 'earlier', 'segments', ""'re"", 'treated', 'endless', 'scenes', 'non-stop', 'vomitting', 'people', 'having', 'bowel', 'movements', 'oh', 'know', 'usual', 'things', 'just', ""can'tlive"", 'fast-forwarded', 'most', 'junk', 'closed', 'eyes', 'vomitting', 'bowel', 'movements', 'scenes.You', 'know', 'Jackass', 'Production', 'everytime', 'scene', 'shown', 'wild', 'screams', 'hysterical', 'laughing', 'can', 'easily', 'imagine', 'old', 'gang', 'aging', 'pranksters', 'be', 'rolling', 'around', 'ground', 'helpless', 'hysteria', 'Too', 'bad', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'doing', 'same', 'thing.None', 'scenes', 'were', 'deemed', 'worthy', 'enough', 'include', 'original', 'programs', ""'re"", 'grade', 'Z', 'garbage', 'be', 'included', 'here.My', 'very', 'favorite', 'bad', 'boy', 'Chris', 'Pontius', 'was', 'given', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'could', 'watch', 'day.What', 'was', 'really', 'outrageous', 'MTV', 'included', 'scenes', 'bodily', 'functions', 'graphically', 'nothing', 'hidden.Yet', 'when', 'guys', 'were', 'photographed', 'naked', 'tushes', 'display', 'cleft', 'division', 'was', 'digitally', 'hidden', 'How', 'crazy', 'Would', 'showing', 'butt', 'crack', 'turned', 'raving', 'lunatics', 'shocked', ""'d"", 'be', 'so', 'great', 'one', 'day', 'could', 'see', 'favorite', 'badboys', 'especially', 'Chris', 'completly', 'nude']",N/A
