1606411,AYHF7LWUHZRMW,B00A7OBIGO,A. Weiner,"[1, 1]","The problem is that it can take a long time to get to the end. I think that the BBC ""All's Well"" is far superior (though the best performance I ever saw was many years ago at the Folger Shakespeare Library). The heart of the play comes from the characters talking about Parolles: ""Is it possible he should know what he is, and be that he is"" because it fits so well when applied to Bertram. However, it also applies to everyone in the theater: ""The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together; our virtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not, and our crimes would despair if they were not cherished by our virtues."" This version, however, throws these lines away. This Bertram is without any redeeming virtues, but for the play to end well we have to feel (and share in) an instant conversion at the very end, and that's largely absent in this Globe Theatre production.",4,All's well really does end well,1376784000,"08 18, 2013",2013,895,"['problem', 'can', 'take', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'end', 'think', 'BBC', 'Well', 'far', 'superior', 'best', 'performance', 'ever', 'saw', 'was', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Folger', 'Shakespeare', 'Library', 'heart', 'play', 'characters', 'talking', 'Parolles', 'possible', 'should', 'know', 'what', 'be', 'so', 'well', 'when', 'applied', 'Bertram', 'However', 'also', 'everyone', 'theater', 'web', 'life', 'mingled', 'yarn', 'good', 'ill', 'together', 'virtues', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'faults', 'whipped', 'not', 'crimes', 'would', 'despair', 'were', 'not', 'cherished', 'virtues', 'version', 'however', 'lines', 'away', 'Bertram', 'redeeming', 'virtues', 'play', 'end', 'well', 'have', 'feel', 'share', 'instant', 'conversion', 'very', 'end', 'largely', 'absent', 'Globe', 'Theatre', 'production']",N/A
1606412,A1HWWRHXZ5GKP1,B00A7OBIGO,"Eric Brinkman ""nyingpo""","[7, 8]","I've been to the Globe three times, and watched most of their DVDs. I unabatedly recommend every one. To see Shakespeare performed at the Globe is how Shakespeare wanted his plays performed; I almost can't even begin to explain the magic of seeing them performed in this way, but I will try.For example, Shakespeare's plays were performed in front of an audience of ""groundlings""--low income common people who only paid a penny to stand in the yard and watch the play. All plays were performed at 2pm, as there were no artificial lights then--meaning that Shakespeare plays were never meant to be performed in a darkened theater--but instead where the actors could see and interact with the audience. A good example of this occurs in this production, when Parolles gestures towards a man in the crowd to see if he would be amenable to Helena for marriage. The crowd laughs, and you feel LIKE YOU'RE A PART OF THE PLAY, because you are. Shakespeare requires our imagination in a way that is a kind of participation that isn't like going to see a movie. Again, I can't explain how different this makes the experience of ""watching"" a play. And this dvd gives you, I think, a sense of that--as you watch the actors interact with the crowd, and run through them as they exit the stage.I love James Garnon; I saw him play Caliban at the Globe in person and he was wonderful. Here, he plays Parolles and does what any great Shakespearean actor does for you--he changes what you thought about the character. His Parolles, although a sycophant and a coward, is redeemable--which makes sense, since he is redeemed in the play. You never hate him, or judge him too harshly--yes, he is a fop, but he's not bad at heart, and you don't second-guess his redemption at the end of the play because it's believable.Sam Crane plays a decent Betram, although I thought he was a better Hotspur. But I thought Ellie Piercy was wonderful--when she walks out on the stage in the last act I teared up... so majestic. I would have been moved to accept her then and there too.The other actor I thought was wonderful was Janie Dee; she almost steals the play. I believed she could love both, and not favor a born son over an adopted daughter. Kudos.In the end though it's Shakespeare: if I have to explain it to you, you don't understand...PS one reviewer described this as a problem play; ""problem"" here doesn't mean there is a problem with the play, in the sense that it's not good. ""Problem"" refers only to the fact that we don't know how to classify it: is it a comedy? It seems that way, but there are tragic elements also. Perhaps more properly it should be categorized as a romance... in any event, there's no ""problem"" in the sense of the writing or characterization. It's only a problem if you don't think about it..."" In Troilus and Cressida and Hamlet no such partial settlement of difficulties takes place, and we are left to interpret their enigmas as best we may. Dramas so singular in theme and temper cannot be strictly called comedies or tragedies. We may therefore borrow a convenient phrase from the theatre of to-day and class them together as Shakespeare's problem-plays."" --Boas",5,"If you like Shakespeare in performance, the Globe's productions are unparalleled",1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,3172,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'Globe', 'three', 'times', 'watched', 'most', 'DVDs', 'unabatedly', 'recommend', 'one', 'see', 'Shakespeare', 'performed', 'Globe', 'how', 'Shakespeare', 'wanted', 'plays', 'performed', 'almost', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'explain', 'magic', 'seeing', 'performed', 'way', 'will', 'try.For', 'example', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'were', 'performed', 'front', 'audience', 'groundlings', 'low', 'income', 'common', 'people', 'who', 'only', 'paid', 'penny', 'stand', 'yard', 'watch', 'play', 'plays', 'were', 'performed', '2pm', 'were', 'artificial', 'lights', 'then', 'meaning', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'were', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'performed', 'darkened', 'theater', 'instead', 'where', 'actors', 'could', 'see', 'interact', 'audience', 'good', 'example', 'production', 'when', 'Parolles', 'man', 'crowd', 'see', 'would', 'be', 'amenable', 'Helena', 'marriage', 'crowd', 'feel', 'YOU', ""'RE"", 'A', 'PART', 'THE', 'PLAY', 'are', 'Shakespeare', 'imagination', 'way', 'kind', 'participation', ""n't"", 'like', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'Again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'how', 'different', 'experience', 'watching', 'play', 'dvd', 'think', 'sense', 'watch', 'actors', 'interact', 'crowd', 'run', 'through', 'exit', 'stage.I', 'love', 'James', 'Garnon', 'saw', 'play', 'Caliban', 'Globe', 'person', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Here', 'Parolles', 'what', 'great', 'Shakespearean', 'actor', 'what', 'thought', 'character', 'Parolles', 'sycophant', 'coward', 'redeemable', 'sense', 'redeemed', 'play', 'never', 'hate', 'judge', 'too', 'harshly', 'yes', 'fop', 'not', 'bad', 'heart', 'do', ""n't"", 'second-guess', 'redemption', 'end', 'play', 'believable.Sam', 'Crane', 'decent', 'Betram', 'thought', 'was', 'better', 'Hotspur', 'thought', 'Ellie', 'Piercy', 'was', 'wonderful', 'when', 'out', 'stage', 'last', 'act', 'teared', 'up', 'so', 'majestic', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'moved', 'accept', 'then', 'there', 'too.The', 'other', 'actor', 'thought', 'was', 'wonderful', 'was', 'Janie', 'Dee', 'almost', 'play', 'believed', 'could', 'love', 'not', 'favor', 'born', 'son', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'Kudos.In', 'end', 'Shakespeare', 'have', 'explain', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'PS', 'one', 'reviewer', 'described', 'problem', 'play', 'problem', 'here', ""n't"", 'mean', 'problem', 'play', 'sense', 'not', 'good', 'Problem', 'only', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'classify', 'comedy', 'way', 'are', 'tragic', 'elements', 'also', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'properly', 'should', 'be', 'categorized', 'romance', 'event', 'problem', 'sense', 'writing', 'characterization', 'only', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Troilus', 'Cressida', 'Hamlet', 'such', 'partial', 'settlement', 'difficulties', 'place', 'are', 'left', 'interpret', 'enigmas', 'may', 'Dramas', 'so', 'singular', 'theme', 'temper', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'strictly', 'called', 'comedies', 'tragedies', 'may', 'therefore', 'borrow', 'convenient', 'phrase', 'theatre', 'to-day', 'class', 'together', 'Shakespeare', 'problem-plays', 'Boas']",N/A
1606413,A2GVX3VN6XR9OA,B00A7OBIGO,Roman,"[3, 4]","Shakespeare&#8217;s plays were written at a time when theater was becoming a new medium allowing to reach new audiences, outside of courts and castles. Therefore, certain ideas and concepts could be injected into the population at large. Shakespeare&#8217;s theater has allowed, and still does, to expose the audiences to an impact of these ideas and concepts.The Globe&#8217;s production of &#8220;All&#8217;s Well That Ends Well&#8221;, directed by John Dove, is another example of how difficult is to correctly deliver the full impact. The play is a description of specific experiences. These experiences are allegorically illustrated as falling in love, being forced to get married, getting pregnant in a bed trick, dying and being reborn, etc. In order to be developmentally effective, these experiences have to follow a precisely defined sequence. Any changes to the sequence destroy the impact. For example, Bertram in &#8220;All&#8217;s Well That Ends Well&#8221; is not ready for the &#8220;kiss&#8221; when he is in Paris. If he was, then it would not be necessary for him to go to Florence. Therefore, making Bertram to kiss Helena in the parting scene in Paris, has ruined the entire impact of the play. In other words, Bertram&#8217;s &#8220;kiss&#8221; has reduced the play&#8217;s impact to &#8230; just a good entertainment.",3,A kiss is not just a kiss,1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,1340,"['Shakespeare', '8217', 'plays', 'were', 'written', 'time', 'when', 'theater', 'was', 'becoming', 'new', 'medium', 'allowing', 'reach', 'new', 'audiences', 'courts', 'castles', 'Therefore', 'certain', 'ideas', 'concepts', 'could', 'be', 'injected', 'population', 'large', 'Shakespeare', '8217', 's', 'theater', 'allowed', 'still', 'expose', 'audiences', 'impact', 'ideas', 'concepts.The', 'Globe', '8217', 's', 'production', '8220', 'All', '8217', 'Well', 'Ends', 'Well', '8221', 'directed', 'John', 'Dove', 'example', 'how', 'difficult', 'correctly', 'deliver', 'full', 'impact', 'play', 'description', 'specific', 'experiences', 'experiences', 'are', 'allegorically', 'illustrated', 'falling', 'love', 'being', 'forced', 'get', 'married', 'getting', 'pregnant', 'bed', 'trick', 'dying', 'being', 'reborn', 'etc', 'order', 'be', 'developmentally', 'effective', 'experiences', 'have', 'follow', 'precisely', 'defined', 'sequence', 'changes', 'sequence', 'destroy', 'impact', 'example', 'Bertram', '8220', 'All', '8217', 'Well', 'Ends', 'Well', '8221', 'not', 'ready', '8220', 'kiss', '8221', 'when', 'Paris', 'was', 'then', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'necessary', 'go', 'Florence', 'Therefore', 'making', 'Bertram', 'kiss', 'Helena', 'parting', 'scene', 'Paris', 'ruined', 'entire', 'impact', 'play', 'other', 'words', 'Bertram', '8217', '8220', 'kiss', '8221', 'reduced', 'play', '8217', 's', 'impact', '8230', 'just', 'good', 'entertainment']",N/A
