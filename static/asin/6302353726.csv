Sure the movie was filmed in the 70s or 80s, but most everything about the movie still goes. International Velvet is the only other horse movie out there that's this legit!

BUT I did seethe riding instructor at the rail with the same blue bandana on her head drinking her coke. She always drank coke.That was her.  Just a bystander in the movie. I wonder if she knows she is in this movie as a bystander?Good movie for horse crazy kids . and adults.This movie unlike most horse movies kept the same pony for all scenes. They even had a gelding for a gelding.
