59572,A36HN1NO7CV072,0783227647,"Amazon Customer ""grenadines""","[18, 18]","I'd known for several years that there was an original version of the glossy, 1959 classic Imitation of Life. So, I was glad to get my hands on a copy so I could compare the two versions - the jury's still out on which one is better, though!This original 1934 version tells the story of two widows and their daughters. Bea, played by Claudette Colbert, and Delilah, played by Louise Beavers. Delilah knocks on Bea's door, thinking that she's found the right house for an advertised maid's job. Delilah stresses how difficult it is finding an employer who'd accept her and her daughter as part of the deal. Bea offers Delilah a job on a trial basis, but her kind demeanour quickly grows on Bea, and Delilah ends up staying permanently.Delilah shares her family's pancake recipe with Bea, and before long, a successful business is in operation. The two of them hit the big time, and soon have an affluent lifestyles (albeit unequal - Delilah still insists on sleeping in the basement). Heartache is just around the corner, though. Delilah's daughter, Peola (played by Fredi Washington) is so pale skinned that she passes for white and rejects her mother. Peola's melancholy persona and rejection breaks Delilah's heart. Peola feels that without her mother around, she could easily join the dominant culture.At the same time, Bea's has problems of her own to contend with, but of a different kind. Bea and her daughter, Jesse, are in love with the same man, and this can only end in disaster.Imitation of Life caused controversy when it was released in 1934. Even today, almost 70 years later, the movie sparks discussions and debates among social commentators. Some complained that the maid stereotype played by Louise Beavers was racist, and is so politically incorrect. Think of life in America in the 30s:1 The country was in the middle of the Great Depression2 Civil rights movements were 30 years away3 Racial segregation was ingrained in society4 Film roles for African Americans were extremely limitedWhen you consider these points, the plot of the film makes sense. The performances by the main characters are superb. Claudette looks particularly elegant and decadent, yet she remains humble and grounded, unlike the flighty 'diva' persona of Lana Turner's character. Louise Beavers may have been restricted to playing maids, but she made the most of her part. She was the best mother Peola could have wanted. Unfortunately, Peola felt that she was the wrong mother for her.The most beguiling character is Peola. Fredi Washington's life was something of a paradox. She was beautiful, green-eyed, straight haired and intelligent. At one point, it seemed as if Peola and Fredi's lives would merge. Fredi was encouraged to pass for white early on in her career. She refused. As such, her film roles were limited. She was far too beautiful and elegant to play maid roles, yet, as an African American actress, Hollywood didn't dare offer her romantic roles with the leading white actors. She was an actress that 30s Hollywood didn't know how to handle.Imitation of Life is a classic movie that's worth getting.

59579,A2VMHFDH5V1BOC,0783227647,Bragan Thomas,"[14, 19]","At one point in the 1959 film, the tortured biracial Sarah Jane examines herself in a mirror and shrieks, ""I'm white!  White!  WHITE!""  Even as we sympathize for her plight and weep for her treatment of her mother Annie, we witness a scene which practically announces its ""fake"" quality!  A white actress pretending to be a black woman pretending to be a white woman is photographed screaming her racial identity in front of a mirror, itself a false image in the middle of another false image - the actual film itself.  Where is the ""reality"" behind so many images?  IMITATION OF LIFE may seem like a silly, over-the-top campfest to the uninitiated or unthinking, but this film is one of the most important in Hollywood history, its very artificiality allowing an emotional honesty rare, or even non-existent, in popular entertainment.This DVD definitely gives you more for your money, with 2 classic movies for the price of one!  Douglas Sirk's 1959 treatment is far better known than the 1934 film, and it deserves to be!  Both films are based on a best-selling novel by white author Fannie Hurst.  The 1934 film sticks close to the source novel, while the 1959 version makes many changes, the vast majority of which improve tremendously on the earlier work.  In both tales, the focus is on four women - two white, two black - whose lives become intertwined as a result of a chance meeting.  In the earlier film, hardworking widow Claudette Colbert becomes the ""Pancake Queen"" of New York business by mass-producing and selling the recipie and image of her loyal friend/maid, Louise Beavers.  Their lives would be idyllic were it not for the problems suffered by Beavers' daughter, Peola.  Peola bears no resemblance at all to her mother, for her mother is a dark-skinned ""Mammy"" while Peola is clearly of European descent in every way.  Peola hates the second-class position she is consigned to as a result of her part-African ancestry, and she takes it out on her mother, severing all contact with the woman and breaking Beavers' heart.  A subplot extends the theme of mother-daughter conflict to the white world, when Colbert's teenage daughter falls in love with her mother's boyfriend. Eventually, Beavers dies, and her estranged daughter shows up at her mother's enormous Harlem funeral, screaming in anguish.Douglas Sirk's version follows the same plot, but pumps up the production with gowns, jewels, wigs and lavish settings.  Instead of an ambitious Pancake Queen, Sirk's main protagonist is the amazing Lana Turner, who plays a rather long-in-the-tooth (but ambitious) actress who becomes a big Broadway star and neglects her own daughter, Susie (played brilliantly by Sandra Dee) along the way.  Helping Lana's rise to stardom is her maid and best friend, Annie Johnson (the Oscar-nominated Juanita Moore).  Annie is a deeply religious, self-sacrificing black woman whose cross to bear is her own daughter, Sarah Jane (incarnated by Susan Kohner in another Oscar-nominated performance).  Sarah Jane, whose missing father was ""almost white,"" despises her mother's color and longs to ""pass"" into the white world as an actress, yet her mother blocks Sarah Jane's attempts to hide her true identity at every turn, saying, ""It's wrong to be ashamed of what you are, and it's a sin to pretend!  The Lord must have had his reasons for making some of us white and some of us black.""  The trick, of course, is that Sarah Jane is NOT ""black,"" something her mother resolutely refuses to recognize.  Sarah Jane's very existence is something between (or beyond) ""black"" and ""white"" and it is in the best interests of both sides that she remain consigned to the black side of the ledger, otherwise everyone might have to admit that race is a far more complex matter than it seems.  Susan Kohner, in fact, was not of African descent, being the daughter of a German cameraman and the Mexican film star Lupita Tovar.  Kohner's looks are quite ambiguous, giving her an ""ethnic"" appearance quite different from the WASP-blondeness of Turner, Dee and Sarah Jane's nasty boyfriend Troy Donahue (who beats her mercilessly when he learns the truth about her), yet she is nevertheless clearly Caucasian.  Sirk remarked once that he would have directed IMITATION OF LIFE ""for the title alone"" and it is indeed the substructure of Sirk's film that makes the most telling points.  The entire melodrama is played with absolute conviction and and a fast pace by all involved.  Even though there are few scenes in the first half of the film (the ""Lana"" half) that do not reek of cliche from start to finish, Sirk's direction is so convincing that each ""Old Hollywood"" bit of thespian nonsense comes across as fresh and exciting!  The film really hits its stride AFTER Lana becomes a huge superstar.  The dramatic center shifts from uber-white Lana and Sandra - whose problems become progressively more stylized and unreal - to Annie and Sarah Jane.  What starts out as a movie about Lana Turner winds up being a film about Lana Turner's black maid, and this switch leads to one of the most emotionally draining sequences in history.  Annie's death scene is genuinely moving, and be prepared to let the tears flow when Sarah Jane makes a surprise visit to her mother's lavish funeral, publicly claiming the identity she previously rejected.  The whole thing is deliberately excessive - an emotional wallow which nevertheless has some very sharp things to say about the hollow nature of American ""success"" and our fraught system of race relations.  I won't even get into how the complex production design and amazing lighting make this a feast for the eyes as well as the mind.  Trust me, this film will linger in your head long after you see it.  It is Douglas Sirk's masterpiece and it was at the time the biggest blockbuster in the history of Universal Studios, as well as one of the first big-budget films which was actually shown to black audiences on first-run screens.  They don't make 'em like this anymore, so be prepared for a very emotional experience that will change your view of society!Plus, Lana's real jewels and Jean Louis gowns are a sight to behold!  Look for her pink-and-red ""hostess"" outfit - you have never and will never see anybody on Earth wearing something like this outside of Hollywood...",5,What About A Mother's Love?!,1130025600,"10 23,

59581,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,0783227647,Byron Kolln,"[1, 2]","In an historical context, director John M. Stahl's original 1934 screen version of IMITATION OF LIFE is still in a league of its own.  With a startling frankness it tackles its controversial subject matter with a candid hand, delivering it with stellar performances from a top-flight cast, led by the magnificent Claudette Colbert and Louise Beavers.Those who are only familiar with Douglas Sirk's splashy colour remake of 1959 (and who haven't read Fannie Hurst's original book upon which the story is based) might feel a bit confused at some of the incidental changes within the characters, but the overall message of the film remains the same.Struggling widow Bea Pullman (Claudette Colbert), a maple syrup saleslady, decides to go into business with her housekeeper Delilah Johnson (Louise Beavers) by marketing Delilah's secret pancake flour recipe.  Their venture takes off in spectacular fashion, but the ladies' personal success is marred by the despair endured by Delilah's fair-skinned daughter Peola (played by the stunning Fredi Washington), who chooses to ""pass"" as white in order to escape the prejudice of strangers.  After Bea discovers that her own teen daughter Jessie (Rochelle Hudson) has developed a messy infatuation for her fianc&eacute; Stephen Archer (Warren William), she, too, is faced with a difficult decision about the future.Despite giving what many had called her greatest performance on film, Louise Beavers was overlooked at the Academy Awards, not even scoring a nomination.  Given the subject matter of the film, Beavers' Oscar slight is even more ironic. In an article from the period, columnist Jimmy Fiddler wrote the following - ""I also lament the fact that the motion picture industry has not set aside racial prejudice in naming actresses. I don't see how it is possible to overlook the magnificent portrayal of Louise Beavers, who played the mother in IMITATION OF LIFE.  If the industry chooses to ignore Miss Beavers' performance, please let this reporter, born and bred in the South, tender a special award of praise to Louise Beavers for the finest performance of 1934.""It is African American actress Fredi Washington who steals this movie.  Her performance as Peola is the true essence of the story and having researched Ms Washington's own life and short film career, the parallels with that of her character must have hit quite close to home.  Ms Washington was genuinely fair-skinned but, unlike Peola, was proud of her heritage and did nothing to hide it (although she was constantly urged by producers and casting agents to ""pass"" in order to further her career).  As a result she only made a handful of films (this was one of her last), but did enjoy some great success on stage, most notably ""Mamba's Daughters"" with Ethel Waters; and later became a leading activist.If you've only ever been familiar with the 1959 colour version of IMITATION OF LIFE (starring Lana Turner, Juanita Moore, Susan Kohner and Sandra Dee), you'll probably feel a bit dismayed at the story changes, but perhaps that's all for the better - can you even begin to picture Lana peddling maple syrup and working in a pancake restaurant?  The changes made in the '59 version were intended to emphasize Lana's glamorous side, and although the film is still wildly-popular (particularly being a seminal Douglas Sirk piece), in comparison with the original 1934 version, it comes up decidedly short.Very highly-recommended.",4,An important Hollywood milestone,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,3447,"['historical', 'context', 'director', 'John', 'M.', 'Stahl', 'original', '1934', 'screen', 'version', 'IMITATION', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'still', 'league', 'own', 'startling', 'frankness', 'controversial', 'subject', 'matter', 'candid', 'hand', 'delivering', 'stellar', 'performances', 'top-flight', 'cast', 'led', 'magnificent', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'Louise', 'Beavers.Those', 'who', 'are', 'only', 'familiar', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'splashy', 'colour', 'remake', '1959', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Fannie', 'Hurst', 'original', 'book', 'story', 'based', 'might', 'feel', 'bit', 'confused', 'incidental', 'changes', 'characters', 'overall', 'message', 'film', 'same.Struggling', 'widow', 'Bea', 'Pullman', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'maple', 'syrup', 'saleslady', 'go', 'business', 'housekeeper', 'Delilah', 'Johnson', 'Louise', 'Beavers', 'marketing', 'Delilah', 'secret', 'pancake', 'flour', 'recipe', 'venture', 'off', 'spectacular', 'fashion', 'ladies', 'personal', 'success', 'marred', 'despair', 'endured', 'Delilah', 'fair-skinned', 'daughter', 'Peola', 'played', 'stunning', 'Fredi', 'Washington', 'who', 'pass', 'white', 'order', 'escape', 'prejudice', 'strangers', 'Bea', 'own', 'teen', 'daughter', 'Jessie', 'Rochelle', 'Hudson', 'developed', 'messy', 'infatuation', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Stephen', 'Archer', 'Warren', 'William', 'too', 'faced', 'difficult', 'decision', 'future.Despite', 'giving', 'what', 'many', 'had', 'called', 'greatest', 'performance', 'film', 'Louise', 'Beavers', 'was', 'overlooked', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'not', 'even', 'scoring', 'nomination', 'Given', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'Beavers', 'Oscar', 'slight', 'even', 'more', 'ironic', 'article', 'period', 'columnist', 'Jimmy', 'Fiddler', 'wrote', 'following', 'also', 'lament', 'fact', 'motion', 'picture', 'industry', 'not', 'set', 'aside', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'naming', 'actresses', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'possible', 'overlook', 'magnificent', 'portrayal', 'Louise', 'Beavers', 'who', 'played', 'mother', 'IMITATION', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'industry', 'ignore', 'Miss', 'Beavers', 'performance', 'please', 'let', 'reporter', 'born', 'bred', 'South', 'tender', 'special', 'award', 'praise', 'Louise', 'Beavers', 'finest', 'performance', '1934', 'African', 'American', 'actress', 'Fredi', 'Washington', 'who', 'movie', 'performance', 'Peola', 'true', 'essence', 'story', 'having', 'researched', 'Ms', 'Washington', 'own', 'life', 'short', 'film', 'career', 'parallels', 'character', 'must', 'have', 'hit', 'quite', 'close', 'home', 'Ms', 'Washington', 'was', 'genuinely', 'fair-skinned', 'Peola', 'was', 'proud', 'heritage', 'did', 'nothing', 'hide', 'was', 'constantly', 'urged', 'producers', 'casting', 'agents', 'pass', 'order', 'further', 'career', 'result', 'only', 'made', 'handful', 'films', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'did', 'enjoy', 'great', 'success', 'stage', 'most', 'notably', 'Mamba', 'Daughters', 'Ethel', 'Waters', 'later', 'became', 'leading', 'activist.If', ""'ve"", 'only', 'ever', 'been', 'familiar', '1959', 'colour', 'version', 'IMITATION', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'starring', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'Juanita', 'Moore', 'Susan', 'Kohner', 'Sandra', 'Dee', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'feel', 'bit', 'dismayed', 'story', 'changes', 'perhaps', 'better', 'can', 'even', 'begin', 'picture', 'Lana', 'peddling', 'maple', 'syrup', 'working', 'pancake', 'restaurant', 'changes', 'made', ""'59"", 'version', 'were', 'intended', 'emphasize', 'Lana', 'glamorous', 'side', 'film', 'still', 'wildly-popular', 'particularly', 'being', 'seminal', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'piece', 'comparison', 'original', '1934', 'version', 'up', 'decidedly', 'short.Very', 'highly-recommended']",N/A

In my opinion the 34 version is the better of the two.  Even though both are really over the top,  at least the first version portrays the black and the white woman more as equals.  The remake actually is more racist and condesending.  The black woman in the original whose name is Delilah is a business woman not a maid.  She is treated like a real person. Claudette Colbert who portrays the the white woman treats Delilah as a partner,  her friends treat her equally. They actually try to talk to Delilah about her daughter and try to help her as a friend would not as a person who is pitied as in the remake. &quot;Poor Annie&quot; as Sandra Dee's character mentions. PLUS I find it insulting that in 1959 Hollywood could not find one black actress to play the part of the daughter,  but way back in 1934 they did.  Ferdi Washington. Delilah's job was not to take care of the white woman and her daughter.  But in the 1959 version that was Annie's job.  Also I like the story of the independent woman that the first version told. It is very strange how Hollywood has regressed. Because most movies would never be about a black and white middle aged single working women with almost grown daughters.  The movie today would be more about the daughters then the mothers. Don't get me wrong the remake I enjoyed but more as a camp over the top melodrama and I do like the actress's in the roles.  But the 1934 version was a better movie.  The fact the the daughter tried to pass as white back in the 30's is more understandable then someone who would try to pass in the later version.  I feel that is more out of self hatred and some bad parenting.  But in 1934 even though it was not a right thing to do it might have been understandable given the times. In any case in both versions the daughters confusion was never dealt with.  In the original it was mentioned that the father was high toned..a light skinned black person.  I think in the remake I had the impression the father was white or &quot;almost white&quot;.  Maybe I should read the book.  I took one star from these 2 movies bcause of the 1959 version. One last thing I love the fact that in the original version at the funeral in Harlem the film makers had the insight to include Marcus Garvey followers in the scene.  They were a very big group in Harlem during the 30's and 40's. Marcus Garvey for people who do not know was a Jamaican who believed in black people being self sufficient and he had a back to Africa movement.  I think the film makers of the original should be commended for putting in that little slice of Harlem's history in the movie.",4,The original is better then the remake,1076457600,"02 11, 2004",2004,2726,"['Finally', 'movies', 'are', 'released', 'together', 'Most', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'know', '1934', 'version', 'exists', 'opinion', '34', 'version', 'better', 'two', 'Even', 'are', 'really', 'top', 'least', 'first', 'version', 'black', 'white', 'woman', 'more', 'equals', 'remake', 'actually', 'more', 'racist', 'condesending', 'black', 'woman', 'original', 'name', 'Delilah', 'business', 'woman', 'not', 'maid', 'treated', 'real', 'person', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'who', 'white', 'woman', 'treats', 'Delilah', 'partner', 'friends', 'treat', 'equally', 'actually', 'try', 'talk', 'Delilah', 'daughter', 'try', 'help', 'friend', 'would', 'not', 'person', 'who', 'pitied', 'remake', 'quot', 'Poor', 'Annie', 'quot', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'character', 'mentions', 'find', 'insulting', '1959', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'one', 'black', 'actress', 'play', 'part', 'daughter', 'way', 'back', '1934', 'did', 'Ferdi', 'Washington', 'Delilah', 'job', 'was', 'not', 'take', 'care', 'white', 'woman', 'daughter', '1959', 'version', 'was', 'Annie', 'job', 'Also', 'like', 'story', 'independent', 'woman', 'first', 'version', 'told', 'very', 'strange', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'regressed', 'most', 'movies', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'black', 'white', 'middle', 'aged', 'single', 'working', 'women', 'almost', 'grown', 'daughters', 'movie', 'today', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'daughters', 'then', 'mothers', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'remake', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'camp', 'top', 'melodrama', 'do', 'actress', 'roles', '1934', 'version', 'was', 'better', 'movie', 'fact', 'daughter', 'tried', 'pass', 'white', 'back', '30', 'more', 'understandable', 'then', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'try', 'pass', 'later', 'version', 'feel', 'more', 'self', 'hatred', 'bad', 'parenting', '1934', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'understandable', 'given', 'times', 'case', 'versions', 'daughters', 'confusion', 'was', 'never', 'dealt', 'original', 'was', 'mentioned', 'father', 'was', 'high', 'toned..a', 'light', 'skinned', 'black', 'person', 'think', 'remake', 'had', 'impression', 'father', 'was', 'white', 'quot', 'almost', 'white', 'quot', 'Maybe', 'should', 'read', 'book', 'took', 'one', 'star', '2', 'movies', '1959', 'version', 'One', 'last', 'thing', 'love', 'fact', 'original', 'version', 'funeral', 'Harlem', 'film', 'makers', 'had', 'insight', 'include', 'Marcus', 'Garvey', 'followers', 'scene', 'were', 'very', 'big', 'group', 'Harlem', '30', '40', 'Marcus', 'Garvey', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'was', 'Jamaican', 'who', 'believed', 'black', 'people', 'being', 'self', 'sufficient', 'had', 'back', 'Africa', 'movement', 'think', 'film', 'makers', 'original', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'putting', 'little', 'slice', 'Harlem', 'history', 'movie']",N/A
59591,A8S11VP9Z36D6,0783227647,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[81, 82]","Having studied the 1959 version of ""Imitation of Life"" in film class, it has become one of my favorite films, one that is rich with many subtexts that may not be visible upon first glance. This special 2-disc DVD set contains both the 1934 and 1959 versions based on a Fannie Hurst tear-jerker novel. Tackling a sensitive issue for the times (in both versions), these movies deal with an African-American girl who wants to pass for white to have more opportunities open up for her. The girl's mother develops a friendship and working/subserviant relationship with a white woman who has her own daughter of the same age. How the two women function in their environments and the conflicts that occur due to the daughter's ""passing"" constitute the basis of both stories.The 1934 film stars Claudette Colbert and Louise Beavers as the mothers. The film seems very dated and old fashioned on the surface; watching it a 2nd time with the commentary track is very beneficial. Avery Clayton, an African-American Cultural Scholar, gives slight information on the making of the film, but gives the story plenty of explanation of the subtexts and is very helpful in putting some of the slightly offensive elements into the context of the times that the film was made. Beavers' character becomes the icon for Aunt Delilah's pancake mix, a thinly veiled version of Aunt Jemima. Colbert's character is given the idea to market Delilah's recipe and the two become rich; the fact that Beaver's character doesn't want any of the riches and is actually afraid NOT to be in a subserviant role to Colbert is somewhat uncomfortable. Colbert gives her typical warm performance and even today, she is a joy to watch. The rest of the film does seem very dated. Interestingly enough, Fredi Washington, an African-American actress, portrays Beaver's daughter; in the 1959 version, Susan Kohner, of Latino background, was the one who won that plum role.The 1959 version still holds up well; granted, it is somewhat over the top with some of the plot & Lana Turner's performance. However, director Douglas Sirk was able to put in so many rich subtexts and subtle critiques that this film can be watched multiple times without catching all of them. There was a battle going on between Sirk wanting an honest crititque of the times, and producer Ross Hunter wanting a glossy soap opera. This film was dismissed as a tawdry melodrama and labeled a dud by critics initially, but has become a cinema classic in the years that followed. Juanita Moore's performance as the African-American maid is one of the keys to the success of the film, and the rest of the casting is brillant: Turner, Sandra Dee, Kohner, and John Gavin. You'll also see a cameo by Sandra Gould, who later achieved minor fame as the 2nd Gladys Kravitz in TV's ""Bewitched."" For the 1959 film, the story is that Lana Turner plays an actress seeking fame, and Moore's character plays her maid and companion. Thankfully, there is no Aunt Delilah business here. Many of the scenes are powerhouses of acting: the final scene between mother and daughter when Moore agrees to let her daughter live her life as a white woman is a guaranteed tear-jerker. Turner also gives one of her best (if not most hysterical) performances during Annie's death scene. The commentary for this version is by Foster Hirsch, a film historian. As with Clayton's, his commentary is mainly limited to examining the film itself, not so much the making of the film. There are a few facts that he shares from his friendships with Susan Kohner and Juanita Moore that are very interesting, but overall, his commentary helps to pick out the hidden meanings that Sirk placed throughout.There is a short featurette calls ""Lasting Legacy - An Imitation of Life"" that talks about both films. Juanita Moore and respected film historians are on hand to talk about the movies. The featurette is very well done, but does leave one wishing there were more to it. It is approximately half an hour long.The quality of both films is fairly good; neither one looks like it came from the original negative, but they are both relatively clean and appear to have had some minor restoration work.This 2-Disc set is a real value, and highly recommended for those who love to study film.",5,Review for 2-Movie Special Edition,1203120000,"02 16, 2008",2008,4269,"['Having', 'studied', '1959', 'version', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'film', 'class', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'one', 'rich', 'many', 'subtexts', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'visible', 'first', 'glance', 'special', '2-disc', 'DVD', 'set', '1934', '1959', 'versions', 'based', 'Fannie', 'Hurst', 'tear-jerker', 'novel', 'Tackling', 'sensitive', 'issue', 'times', 'versions', 'movies', 'deal', 'African-American', 'girl', 'who', 'pass', 'white', 'have', 'more', 'opportunities', 'open', 'up', 'girl', 'mother', 'friendship', 'working/subserviant', 'relationship', 'white', 'woman', 'who', 'own', 'daughter', 'same', 'age', 'How', 'two', 'women', 'function', 'environments', 'conflicts', 'occur', 'due', 'daughter', 'passing', 'basis', 'stories.The', '1934', 'film', 'stars', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'Louise', 'Beavers', 'mothers', 'film', 'very', 'dated', 'old', 'fashioned', 'surface', 'watching', '2nd', 'time', 'commentary', 'track', 'very', 'beneficial', 'Avery', 'Clayton', 'African-American', 'Cultural', 'Scholar', 'slight', 'information', 'making', 'film', 'story', 'plenty', 'explanation', 'subtexts', 'very', 'helpful', 'putting', 'slightly', 'offensive', 'elements', 'context', 'times', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Beavers', 'character', 'icon', 'Aunt', 'Delilah', 'pancake', 'mix', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'version', 'Aunt', 'Jemima', 'Colbert', 'character', 'given', 'idea', 'market', 'Delilah', 'recipe', 'two', 'become', 'rich', 'fact', 'Beaver', 'character', ""n't"", 'want', 'riches', 'actually', 'afraid', 'NOT', 'be', 'subserviant', 'role', 'Colbert', 'somewhat', 'uncomfortable', 'Colbert', 'typical', 'warm', 'performance', 'even', 'today', 'joy', 'watch', 'rest', 'film', 'seem', 'very', 'dated', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'Fredi', 'Washington', 'African-American', 'actress', 'Beaver', 'daughter', '1959', 'version', 'Susan', 'Kohner', 'Latino', 'background', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'won', 'plum', 'role.The', '1959', 'version', 'still', 'up', 'well', 'granted', 'somewhat', 'top', 'plot', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'performance', 'However', 'director', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'was', 'able', 'put', 'so', 'many', 'rich', 'subtexts', 'subtle', 'critiques', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'multiple', 'times', 'catching', 'was', 'battle', 'going', 'Sirk', 'wanting', 'honest', 'crititque', 'times', 'producer', 'Ross', 'Hunter', 'wanting', 'glossy', 'soap', 'opera', 'film', 'was', 'dismissed', 'tawdry', 'melodrama', 'labeled', 'dud', 'critics', 'initially', 'become', 'cinema', 'classic', 'years', 'followed', 'Juanita', 'Moore', 'performance', 'African-American', 'maid', 'one', 'keys', 'success', 'film', 'rest', 'casting', 'brillant', 'Turner', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'Kohner', 'John', 'Gavin', ""'ll"", 'also', 'see', 'cameo', 'Sandra', 'Gould', 'who', 'later', 'achieved', 'minor', 'fame', '2nd', 'Gladys', 'Kravitz', 'TV', 'Bewitched', '1959', 'film', 'story', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'actress', 'seeking', 'fame', 'Moore', 'character', 'maid', 'companion', 'Thankfully', 'Aunt', 'Delilah', 'business', 'here', 'Many', 'scenes', 'are', 'powerhouses', 'acting', 'final', 'scene', 'mother', 'daughter', 'when', 'Moore', 'let', 'daughter', 'live', 'life', 'white', 'woman', 'guaranteed', 'tear-jerker', 'Turner', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'not', 'most', 'hysterical', 'performances', 'Annie', 'death', 'scene', 'commentary', 'version', 'Foster', 'Hirsch', 'film', 'historian', 'Clayton', 'commentary', 'mainly', 'limited', 'examining', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'making', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'facts', 'shares', 'friendships', 'Susan', 'Kohner', 'Juanita', 'Moore', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'overall', 'commentary', 'pick', 'out', 'hidden', 'meanings', 'Sirk', 'placed', 'short', 'featurette', 'Lasting', 'Legacy', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'talks', 'films', 'Juanita', 'Moore', 'respected', 'film', 'historians', 'are', 'hand', 'talk', 'movies', 'featurette', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'leave', 'one', 'wishing', 'were', 'more', 'approximately', 'hour', 'long.The', 'quality', 'films', 'fairly', 'good', 'one', 'came', 'original', 'negative', 'are', 'relatively', 'clean', 'appear', 'have', 'had', 'minor', 'restoration', 'work.This', '2-Disc', 'set', 'real', 'value', 'highly', 'recommended', 'who', 'love', 'study', 'film']",N/A

But, this is the original version, and I find it far superior to the remake for so many reasons.First of all, it takes place in the early 1930's, putting us smack dab in the Depression, and a time period which suits the subject matter. Claudette Colbert, a much better actress than Lana Turner, is one of the first reasons I prefer this version. But, mainly, the incredible Louise Beavers is absolutely unforgettable as the black maid, Delilah Johnson, whose light-skinned daughter, Peola, is raised alongside Colbert's daughter, Jessie.When the girls grow up, Peola realizes that she can ""pass"" for white, and in the 1930's, with racism and joblessness rampant, her choice makes sense, for the times. When Peola, played by Fredi Washington, completely rejects her mother, it is heartbreaking. To see Louise Beavers sobbing onto the counter in the department store is truly painful.Peola breaks her mother's heart in order to fit into a world that would not accept her otherwise. In the end, she regrets the pain she causes her mother. This is another time and place, and we don't hate Peola for hurting her mother. Still, our heart bleeds for Delilah.The acting is top notch, and I will take this more entertaining and serious version of the film over the campy re-make any day.",4,"The original, and still the best version",1037750400,"11 20, 2002",2002,1379,"['Most', 'viewers', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'familiar', 'campy', '1959', 'version', 'film', 'starring', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'original', 'version', 'find', 'far', 'superior', 'remake', 'so', 'many', 'reasons.First', 'place', 'early', '1930', 'putting', 'smack', 'dab', 'Depression', 'time', 'period', 'suits', 'subject', 'matter', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'much', 'better', 'actress', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'one', 'first', 'reasons', 'prefer', 'version', 'mainly', 'incredible', 'Louise', 'Beavers', 'absolutely', 'unforgettable', 'black', 'maid', 'Delilah', 'Johnson', 'light-skinned', 'daughter', 'Peola', 'raised', 'Colbert', 'daughter', 'Jessie.When', 'girls', 'grow', 'up', 'Peola', 'can', 'pass', 'white', '1930', 'racism', 'joblessness', 'rampant', 'choice', 'sense', 'times', 'When', 'Peola', 'played', 'Fredi', 'Washington', 'completely', 'mother', 'heartbreaking', 'see', 'Louise', 'Beavers', 'sobbing', 'counter', 'department', 'store', 'truly', 'painful.Peola', 'mother', 'heart', 'order', 'fit', 'world', 'would', 'not', 'accept', 'otherwise', 'end', 'pain', 'mother', 'time', 'place', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'Peola', 'hurting', 'mother', 'Still', 'heart', 'Delilah.The', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'will', 'take', 'more', 'entertaining', 'serious', 'version', 'film', 'campy', 're-make', 'day']",N/A
59595,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,0783227647,Douglas M,"[1, 4]","A set containing the 2 versions of ""Imitation of Life"", made 25 years apart, is a great idea, providing an excellent opportunity to compare 2 very different director's approach to a piece of popular pulp fiction, the Fannie Hurst novel of the same name. There are many detailed reviews on Amazon and they seem to lean towards general approval. Since I thought the 1934 version only adequate and the 1959 version ghastly, I obviously don't feel the same way so here are a few reasons:- both films purport to be enlightening on racism but it is questionable. When the book was written in 1933, I suppose it was necessary to make the black woman uneducated and humble to the bitter end. It dates the story immeasurably.- both films are superficial but in very different ways, geared as they are to the talents of their leading ladies.- in 1934, Claudette Colbert was a charming and capable leading lady, exactly the qualities she displays in the film. The reality of being a tough business woman is not on display and Colbert's emotions are never much deeper than her impeccable make up and costumes. Her romantic scenes opposite Warren William, especially when she can display her wry sense of humour, are her best.- the 1959 version fleshes out the motivations of Lana Turner to succeed and accordingly, she is a less sympathetic creature.  Aficionados will tell you that it was a master stroke to cast Turner but whether this is true or not, a plastic Lana Turner playing an ambitious plastic actress is still a void.- the director of the 1934 version is John Stahl who specialised in women's films with a suffering heroine. The direction is competent but unimaginative.- both scripts contain a lot of spurious dialogue. In Turner's version, there is far too much unconvincing hand-wringing.- the director in 1959 was Douglas Sirk, the master of the overwrought melodrama, and the film is packed with heightened emotions and glossy trimmings.- the soundtrack in Turner's version is over the top, punctuating every point of the melodrama. Colbert's version has almost no soundtrack.- in both films, which cover a 15+ year span, neither leading lady ages although Turner looks much too old at the start of her version and Colbert does ""act"" mature as her story progresses. Both actresses are overdressed to kill.- the best acting in both films is done by the black actresses, Louise Beavers (1934) and Juanita Moore (1959), who partner the leading ladies.Both prints are adequate. The contrast in the 1934 version is not so good at times and the colour in 1959 is sometimes odd. My copy of the DVD contains a commentary for the 1959 version provided by an unabashed fan so if you feel like me about the film, you may not be interested. There is also a booklet with an erudite essay on the 1959 version. It points out all the directorial touches to enhance Sirk's vision but while this may be true, it does not make the end result any more palatable.",3,Good package of dated pulp fiction,1293667200,"12 30, 2010",2010,2947,"['set', 'containing', '2', 'versions', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'made', '25', 'years', 'apart', 'great', 'idea', 'providing', 'excellent', 'opportunity', 'compare', '2', 'very', 'different', 'director', 'approach', 'piece', 'popular', 'pulp', 'fiction', 'Fannie', 'Hurst', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'are', 'many', 'detailed', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'seem', 'lean', 'towards', 'general', 'approval', 'thought', '1934', 'version', 'only', 'adequate', '1959', 'version', 'ghastly', 'obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'here', 'are', 'few', 'reasons', 'films', 'purport', 'be', 'enlightening', 'racism', 'questionable', 'When', 'book', 'was', 'written', '1933', 'suppose', 'was', 'necessary', 'make', 'black', 'woman', 'uneducated', 'humble', 'bitter', 'end', 'story', 'immeasurably.-', 'films', 'are', 'superficial', 'very', 'different', 'ways', 'geared', 'are', 'talents', 'leading', 'ladies.-', '1934', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'was', 'charming', 'capable', 'leading', 'lady', 'exactly', 'qualities', 'film', 'reality', 'being', 'tough', 'business', 'woman', 'not', 'display', 'Colbert', 'emotions', 'are', 'never', 'much', 'deeper', 'impeccable', 'make', 'up', 'costumes', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'opposite', 'Warren', 'William', 'especially', 'when', 'can', 'display', 'wry', 'sense', 'humour', 'are', 'best.-', '1959', 'version', 'out', 'motivations', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'succeed', 'accordingly', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'creature', 'Aficionados', 'will', 'tell', 'was', 'master', 'stroke', 'cast', 'Turner', 'true', 'not', 'plastic', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'playing', 'ambitious', 'plastic', 'actress', 'still', 'void.-', 'director', '1934', 'version', 'John', 'Stahl', 'who', 'specialised', 'women', 'films', 'suffering', 'heroine', 'direction', 'competent', 'unimaginative.-', 'scripts', 'contain', 'lot', 'spurious', 'dialogue', 'Turner', 'version', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'unconvincing', 'hand-wringing.-', 'director', '1959', 'was', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'master', 'overwrought', 'melodrama', 'film', 'packed', 'heightened', 'emotions', 'glossy', 'trimmings.-', 'soundtrack', 'Turner', 'version', 'top', 'punctuating', 'point', 'melodrama', 'Colbert', 'version', 'almost', 'soundtrack.-', 'films', 'cover', '15+', 'year', 'span', 'leading', 'lady', 'ages', 'Turner', 'much', 'too', 'old', 'start', 'version', 'Colbert', 'act', 'mature', 'story', 'actresses', 'are', 'overdressed', 'kill.-', 'best', 'acting', 'films', 'done', 'black', 'actresses', 'Louise', 'Beavers', '1934', 'Juanita', 'Moore', '1959', 'who', 'partner', 'leading', 'ladies.Both', 'prints', 'are', 'adequate', 'contrast', '1934', 'version', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'times', 'colour', '1959', 'sometimes', 'odd', 'copy', 'DVD', 'commentary', '1959', 'version', 'provided', 'unabashed', 'fan', 'so', 'feel', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'interested', 'also', 'booklet', 'erudite', 'essay', '1959', 'version', 'out', 'directorial', 'touches', 'enhance', 'Sirk', 'vision', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'not', 'make', 'end', 'result', 'more', 'palatable']",N/A
59596,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0783227647,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","Fannie Hurst's tear jerking 1933 novel about the sacrifices mothers make for their daughters spawned two popular movies separated by a quarter century of glacially-changing social attitudes - a highly regarded 1934 version that remains faithful to the book's narrative and an elaborate 1959 remake which changes certain plot details to service German-born filmmaker Douglas Sirk's heavily Baroque style of filmmaking. Both films maintain the same basic time-spanning storyline of two widows - one is a white woman who finds professional success but at a price that causes an unintended estrangement from her daughter, while the other is a black woman whose light-skinned daughter causes nothing but grief for all concerned. Universal has creatively decided to release both movies on the same DVD, which makes a quality comparison between the two productions inevitable.Directed by John M. Stahl, the earlier black-and-white film focuses on Beatrice Pullman, a downtrodden white woman who bonds with Delilah Johnson, a cheery black woman, and opens up a waffle shop to support their daughters Jessie and Peola respectively. Their business becomes such a success that it gets franchised into a chain of coffee shops that market Delilah's waffle recipe and then turns into a major business venture producing the waffle mix en masse. Meantime, Delilah stays devoted to Beatrice as her maid (despite earning twenty percent of the company's profits), and together they raise their daughters. Beatrice eventually finds love with Stephen Archer, an ichthyologist for whom Jessie develops a crush. Far more seriously, Peola runs away to escape her black identity and puts Delilah into an emotional tailspin.In the same year she made ""It Happened One Night"" and DeMille's ""Cleopatra"", Claudette Colbert shows her trademark natural &eacute;lan which allows her to be the emotional gravitational force her character Beatrice requires her to be. Louise Beavers, who made a career of playing sunny-faced maids, gets her one shot at a first-class role and plays Delilah with great poignancy despite the inherent racism behind the conception of the role. The rest of the cast is merely adequate, though the real standout is Fredi Washington, a seminal mulatto actress who portrays Peola with searing resentment and deepening regret.Produced by Ross Hunter with all his hold-no-expense lushness, the color 1959 film stars Lana Turner as ambitious aspiring actress Lora Meredith, who meets Annie Johnson accidentally when their daughters Susie and Sarah Jane get lost playing with each other at Coney Island. Same as the first story, Annie becomes Lora's maid, but this time, Annie does not play a direct role in Lora's professional success. Again, Steve Archer enters the picture, this time as a photographer, and despite arguments and separations between the two (including a liaison she has with her Svengali-like playwright), their romance turns serious just as Susie falls in love with him, too. Sarah Jane becomes a more kittenish figure in this version, running away to become a chorus girl in a seedy nightclub but claiming to work in a library. Regrets soon crystallize into actions with inevitably tragic consequences.Looking frankly too old for the early scenes, the heavily glamorized Turner is such an exaggerated presence from the outset that it is hard to take her seriously as Lora, even though she manages some skillfully rendered moments throughout. Probably an appropriate move at the time, Juanita Moore downplays Annie away from stereotype, but her character's irrelevance in Lora's career seems like a big step backward from the first version. Susan Kohner lends a Natalie Wood-like petulance as Sarah Jane, though the fact that she is a white actress undermines some of her credibility, even when she is brutalized by a racist boyfriend (played by a nasty Troy Donahue) in the film's most powerful scene.A very young Sandra Dee is simply too perky as Susie, though she has one surprisingly honest moment when she nails her mother for being pretentiously noble. Sirk's melodramatic touch is assured throughout and even uses gospel great Mahalia Jackson to sing a roof-raising hymn at the end (""Trouble All Over the World""). Both films are intriguing curios of a bygone era and worthy of a broader sociological discussion of the evolving landscape of feminism and racism in the 20th century.

59599,ALSTMFDRPWWWK,0783227647,Firestarter,"[2, 5]","I'm not really a big fan of The Imitation of Life, which truthfully is/was a white woman's fantasy (I'm speaking of both versions of the film).The ONLY reason I ever watched the film (and I've seen both versions) is because of the BLACK actress, Fredi Washington, who played Peola in the 1934 version. She was a fascinating and inspiring woman. After doing a considerable amount of research on the actress, I was impressed with her intelligence, her ability to stand her ground and her activism for civil rights. She was truly ahead of her time.As for the film...Fredi Washington, correctly pointed out that Peola did NOT want to be white. Instead she wanted the SAME privileges that whites in her world had and denied her because of her racial makeup. This is something I'm sure Fredi Washington, a proud outspoken black woman, (both her parents were light-skinned black people according to her sister Isabella Washington) who could pass for white, understood and tried to make the producers of the film understand.THE ABOVE REALITY IS LEFT OUT OF THE FILM IN ORDER TO FUEL WHITE SUPREMACY.I'm sure it brings comfort to the minds of white supremacist to think a black child might prefer to be white rather than black (and for SOME that might be the case) when the reality is the character Peola didn't suffer from self-hate. She simply wanted the same opportunities and quality of life as whites. I'm fairly certain it was the same for most black people during that time (and today too), which is why many were angered by The Imitation of Life (see: Langston Hughes).Though I'm not crazy about the film, I would like to see a remake of the film's premise with a white woman as the mother of a child that LOOKS (key word) like any other racially identifiable black person (ex. Barack Obama), who rejects her because she is white.The child should see her race (and consequently her) as the oppressors and destroyers of the world.Ideally this child needs to be a male (it wouldn't be as effective if the child were a female as black men are more vocal about white oppression/racism than black women in this day and age), who only claims one side of his heritage though his mother raised him alone. He should be so anti-white that he goes out of his way never to date anyone white or attend any institution that is predominately white.I would like to see how people would react to that film/story.",4,Hmm...How About A Remake Of the Film's Premise?,1327190400,"01 22, 2012",2012,2394,"[""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'big', 'fan', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'truthfully', 'is/was', 'white', 'woman', 'fantasy', ""'m"", 'speaking', 'versions', 'film', 'ONLY', 'reason', 'ever', 'watched', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'versions', 'BLACK', 'actress', 'Fredi', 'Washington', 'who', 'played', 'Peola', '1934', 'version', 'was', 'fascinating', 'inspiring', 'woman', 'doing', 'considerable', 'amount', 'research', 'actress', 'was', 'impressed', 'intelligence', 'ability', 'stand', 'ground', 'activism', 'civil', 'rights', 'was', 'truly', 'ahead', 'time.As', 'film', 'Fredi', 'Washington', 'correctly', 'pointed', 'out', 'Peola', 'did', 'NOT', 'want', 'be', 'white', 'Instead', 'wanted', 'SAME', 'whites', 'world', 'had', 'denied', 'because', 'racial', 'makeup', 'something', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Fredi', 'Washington', 'proud', 'outspoken', 'black', 'woman', 'parents', 'were', 'light-skinned', 'black', 'people', 'according', 'sister', 'Isabella', 'Washington', 'who', 'could', 'pass', 'white', 'understood', 'tried', 'make', 'producers', 'film', 'understand.THE', 'ABOVE', 'REALITY', 'IS', 'LEFT', 'OUT', 'THE', 'FILM', 'IN', 'ORDER', 'TO', 'FUEL', 'WHITE', 'SUPREMACY.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'comfort', 'minds', 'white', 'supremacist', 'think', 'black', 'child', 'might', 'prefer', 'be', 'white', 'rather', 'black', 'SOME', 'might', 'be', 'case', 'when', 'reality', 'character', 'Peola', 'did', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'self-hate', 'simply', 'wanted', 'same', 'opportunities', 'quality', 'life', 'whites', ""'m"", 'fairly', 'certain', 'was', 'same', 'most', 'black', 'people', 'time', 'today', 'too', 'why', 'many', 'were', 'angered', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'see', 'Langston', 'Hughes', ""'m"", 'not', 'crazy', 'film', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'remake', 'film', 'premise', 'white', 'woman', 'mother', 'child', 'LOOKS', 'key', 'word', 'other', 'racially', 'identifiable', 'black', 'person', 'ex', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'who', 'white.The', 'child', 'should', 'see', 'race', 'consequently', 'oppressors', 'destroyers', 'world.Ideally', 'child', 'be', 'male', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'effective', 'child', 'were', 'female', 'black', 'men', 'are', 'more', 'vocal', 'white', 'oppression/racism', 'black', 'women', 'day', 'age', 'who', 'only', 'one', 'side', 'heritage', 'mother', 'raised', 'alone', 'should', 'be', 'so', 'anti-white', 'way', 'never', 'date', 'anyone', 'white', 'attend', 'institution', 'predominately', 'white.I', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'would', 'react', 'film/story']",N/A

Neither has money, initially.  One woman gives the other a place to stay, and she does housekeeping duties for her.  The children become great friends and grow together while the mothers also become great friends and household companions.  The caucasian woman becomes a famous movie actress.  Emotions go off the charts when the African-American girl, who appears white, decides to hide her heritage and breaks her mother's heart.

Like the actress who plays her daughter (Sandra Dee), what people often criticize as Turner's ""non-acting"" is really the best kind of screen acting, a simple way of presenting oneself that the camera loves and a dignity that will withstand even the most ludicrous dialogue and situations.  Sirk knows how to play this up--I imagine changing the character from a businesswoman into an actress is his way of accentuating how phony and self-absorbed Lora Meredith can be, and yet Turner makes us realize that this is the way that Lora has been forced to live her life to evade the Depression and to come out on top.  We're cheering for her every step of the way, just as we would any dumb animal who's been beaten down and is looking for a ray of sunshine.  When the neo-realismo director approaches Lora Meredith to tell her that, of all actresses in the world, he has selected her because of her innate gifts, it's so ludicrous it makes us look around at others in the movie theater to see if they are registering the same kind of shock: the world has jumped a little on its access.  It's the product of a moviegoer's imagination: someone must have remembered the seismic repercussions when Rossellini asked Ingrid Bergman to star in STROMBOLI eight years earlier.  Certainly the Bergman-Rossellini collaboration hangs heavy over the IMITATION OF LIFE remake, as every scene seems to have its parallel in some earlier Bergman films, be it VOYAGE IN ITALY, FEAR, EUROPA 51, or JOAN OF ARC BURNED AT THE STAKE.  The loveless marriages and the striving for a divine connection forecast individual scenes in Sirk's IMITATION, and yet Sirk has something that Rossellini doesn't--he injects race issues into the script, and in doing so brings out some shadows of American life that Bergman and Rossellini, it can now be seen, evaded by fleeing the United States in 1950.  Sirk is a little bolder, though some have questioned whether, in casting Susan Kohler rather than a black actress such as Fredi Washington in the 1934 version, he too was seeking to escape box office punishment and Southern rejection.  Kohler is superb, her sulky lip furious in its threat, heartbreaking when she cracks.  Hers is one of the great performances of the postwar era, it's blistering like red paint.  In the Stahl film Fredi Washington seems more restrained, toned down after the outrageous spectacle she presented in THE EMPEROR JONES, but on the other hand Kohler got lucky and the scriptwriters decided to include a white boyfriend for her to react against (Troy Donahue), and his rage matches hers, galvanizes it--there's no corresponding scene in the Stahl film.Comparing the performances it is easy to see that Warren William (1934) is miles better at acting than John Gavin (1959), and yet Sirk uses Gavin's hangdog pretty boy looks better than Stahl was able to maneuver his way around Warren William's impetuous danger signs.",5,A Difference Of Intention,1119571200,"06 24, 2005",2005,3061,"['Claudette', 'Colbert', 'actress', 'Gallic', 'polish', 'style', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'quality', 'more', 'expressive', 'Colbert', 'charm', 'actress', 'who', 'daughter', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'what', 'people', 'often', 'criticize', 'Turner', 'non-acting', 'really', 'best', 'kind', 'screen', 'acting', 'simple', 'way', 'presenting', 'camera', 'dignity', 'will', 'withstand', 'even', 'most', 'ludicrous', 'dialogue', 'situations', 'Sirk', 'how', 'play', 'up', 'imagine', 'changing', 'character', 'businesswoman', 'actress', 'way', 'accentuating', 'how', 'phony', 'self-absorbed', 'Lora', 'Meredith', 'can', 'be', 'yet', 'Turner', 'realize', 'way', 'Lora', 'been', 'forced', 'live', 'life', 'evade', 'Depression', 'come', 'out', 'top', ""'re"", 'cheering', 'step', 'way', 'just', 'would', 'dumb', 'animal', 'who', 'been', 'beaten', 'down', 'looking', 'ray', 'sunshine', 'When', 'neo-realismo', 'director', 'approaches', 'Lora', 'Meredith', 'tell', 'actresses', 'world', 'selected', 'innate', 'gifts', 'so', 'ludicrous', 'look', 'around', 'others', 'movie', 'theater', 'see', 'are', 'registering', 'same', 'kind', 'shock', 'world', 'jumped', 'little', 'access', 'product', 'moviegoer', 'imagination', 'someone', 'must', 'have', 'remembered', 'seismic', 'repercussions', 'when', 'Rossellini', 'asked', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'star', 'STROMBOLI', 'eight', 'years', 'earlier', 'Certainly', 'Bergman-Rossellini', 'collaboration', 'hangs', 'heavy', 'IMITATION', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'remake', 'scene', 'have', 'parallel', 'earlier', 'Bergman', 'films', 'be', 'VOYAGE', 'IN', 'ITALY', 'FEAR', 'EUROPA', '51', 'JOAN', 'OF', 'ARC', 'BURNED', 'AT', 'THE', 'STAKE', 'loveless', 'marriages', 'striving', 'divine', 'connection', 'forecast', 'individual', 'scenes', 'Sirk', 'IMITATION', 'yet', 'Sirk', 'something', 'Rossellini', ""n't"", 'race', 'issues', 'script', 'doing', 'so', 'out', 'shadows', 'American', 'life', 'Bergman', 'Rossellini', 'can', 'now', 'be', 'seen', 'evaded', 'fleeing', 'United', 'States', '1950', 'Sirk', 'little', 'bolder', 'have', 'questioned', 'casting', 'Susan', 'Kohler', 'rather', 'black', 'actress', 'such', 'Fredi', 'Washington', '1934', 'version', 'too', 'was', 'seeking', 'escape', 'box', 'office', 'punishment', 'Southern', 'rejection', 'Kohler', 'superb', 'sulky', 'lip', 'furious', 'threat', 'heartbreaking', 'when', 'Hers', 'one', 'great', 'performances', 'postwar', 'era', 'blistering', 'red', 'paint', 'Stahl', 'film', 'Fredi', 'Washington', 'more', 'restrained', 'toned', 'down', 'outrageous', 'spectacle', 'presented', 'THE', 'EMPEROR', 'JONES', 'other', 'hand', 'Kohler', 'got', 'lucky', 'scriptwriters', 'decided', 'include', 'white', 'boyfriend', 'react', 'Troy', 'Donahue', 'rage', 'hers', 'corresponding', 'scene', 'Stahl', 'film.Comparing', 'performances', 'easy', 'see', 'Warren', 'William', '1934', 'miles', 'better', 'acting', 'John', 'Gavin', '1959', 'yet', 'Sirk', 'Gavin', 'hangdog', 'pretty', 'boy', 'better', 'Stahl', 'was', 'able', 'maneuver', 'way', 'Warren', 'William', 'impetuous', 'danger', 'signs']",N/A

59613,A1L43KWWR05PCS,0783227647,Lawyeraau,"[30, 32]","Based upon the Fannie Hurst novel of the same name, this 1934 film starring Claudette Colbert and Louise Deavers is a terrific, well acted, sentimental melodrama that should be viewed with a caveat. It is so politically incorrect as to be nearly astounding. It reflects a paternalistic view of African-Americans that was reflective of the time in which this film was written. It is certainly is a view that is jarring in these more enlightened times, as it reflects the nature of the racism that was inherent in our society at that time. Notwithstanding this, it is still a terrific film that was deservedly nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture.Claudette Colbert plays the role of Bea, a struggling widow with a young daughter. Louise Deavers plays the part of Delilah, Bea's African-American housekeeper. She, too, has a young daughter. Both women are struggling to survive. Delilah, however, has a pancake recipe that is out of this world. Bea, upon tasting it, decides to market it in hopes of making their fortune. Delilah agrees to this.Before you know it, they are raking in a fortune with Delilah's pancake mix. Bea offers Delilah a  cut of the business which offer Delilah declines, preferring to remain with Bea, living with her and waiting on her, always the perennial mammy.(See what I mean!) While Bea always treats Delilah with affection and care, there is not a level playing field between the two. Bea lives upstairs in their palatial mansion, while Delilah is relegated to her basement room, comforted by her stalwart belief in God.Meanwhile, the years have passed and Delilah's light skinned daughter, Peola (Fredi Washington), clearly knows the score.  She certainly has no intention of being anyone's mammy and wants to pass for white, as she does not wish to be relegated to second class citizenry. She does not try to do this because she wants to be white, but rather, she wants the advantages associated with  being white in that time. Hers is not a decision based upon race self hate, but upon a realistic assessment of how she could be all she could be. Still, she breaks Delilah's heart by doing this and when Delilah dies, ostensibly of a broken heart, replete with Negro spirituals in the background, Peola repentently breaks down.All in all, this is a mesmerizing film, both cinematically and historically, as it is a reflection of another time in which racial conflict was viewed in such a paternalistic way. Claudette Colbert, Louise Deavers, and Fredi Washington all give moving, compelling performances, nothwithstanding the political incorrectness of the script. This sentimental tearjerker is a definite must see by those who enjoy first rate melodramas and those who simply love vintage films.",5,POLITICALLY INCORRECT SENTIMENTAL TEARJERKER...,1013385600,"02 11, 2002",2002,2739,"['Based', 'Fannie', 'Hurst', 'novel', 'same', 'name', '1934', 'film', 'starring', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'Louise', 'Deavers', 'terrific', 'well', 'acted', 'sentimental', 'melodrama', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'caveat', 'so', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'be', 'nearly', 'astounding', 'paternalistic', 'view', 'African-Americans', 'was', 'reflective', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'certainly', 'view', 'jarring', 'more', 'enlightened', 'times', 'nature', 'racism', 'was', 'inherent', 'society', 'time', 'Notwithstanding', 'still', 'terrific', 'film', 'was', 'deservedly', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Picture.Claudette', 'Colbert', 'role', 'Bea', 'struggling', 'widow', 'young', 'daughter', 'Louise', 'Deavers', 'part', 'Delilah', 'Bea', 'African-American', 'housekeeper', 'too', 'young', 'daughter', 'women', 'are', 'struggling', 'survive', 'Delilah', 'however', 'pancake', 'recipe', 'world', 'Bea', 'tasting', 'market', 'hopes', 'making', 'fortune', 'Delilah', 'this.Before', 'know', 'are', 'raking', 'fortune', 'Delilah', 'pancake', 'mix', 'Bea', 'Delilah', 'cut', 'business', 'offer', 'Delilah', 'declines', 'preferring', 'remain', 'Bea', 'living', 'waiting', 'always', 'perennial', 'mammy', 'See', 'what', 'mean', 'Bea', 'always', 'Delilah', 'affection', 'care', 'not', 'level', 'playing', 'field', 'two', 'Bea', 'upstairs', 'palatial', 'mansion', 'Delilah', 'relegated', 'basement', 'room', 'comforted', 'stalwart', 'belief', 'God.Meanwhile', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'Delilah', 'light', 'skinned', 'daughter', 'Peola', 'Fredi', 'Washington', 'clearly', 'score', 'certainly', 'intention', 'being', 'anyone', 'mammy', 'pass', 'white', 'not', 'wish', 'be', 'relegated', 'second', 'class', 'citizenry', 'not', 'try', 'do', 'be', 'white', 'rather', 'advantages', 'associated', 'being', 'white', 'time', 'Hers', 'not', 'decision', 'based', 'race', 'self', 'hate', 'realistic', 'assessment', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'could', 'be', 'Still', 'Delilah', 'heart', 'doing', 'when', 'Delilah', 'ostensibly', 'broken', 'heart', 'replete', 'Negro', 'spirituals', 'background', 'Peola', 'repentently', 'down.All', 'mesmerizing', 'film', 'cinematically', 'historically', 'reflection', 'time', 'racial', 'conflict', 'was', 'viewed', 'such', 'paternalistic', 'way', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'Louise', 'Deavers', 'Fredi', 'Washington', 'give', 'moving', 'compelling', 'performances', 'nothwithstanding', 'political', 'incorrectness', 'script', 'sentimental', 'tearjerker', 'definite', 'must', 'see', 'who', 'enjoy', 'first', 'rate', 'melodramas', 'who', 'simply', 'love', 'vintage', 'films']",N/A
59614,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,0783227647,Linda Linguvic,"[2, 2]","Based on the novel by Fanny Hurst, this classic 1934 film surprised me in many ways.  Starring Claudette Colbert and Louise Beavers, it certainly tackles the issue of race in a unique way for its time.  I expected it to be stereotyped in the depiction of the relations between the rags-to-riches single mom and her African American housekeeper, but that was not the case.  Both women had rich and complex roles. And the color of the women's skin drove the drama in unexpected and meaningful ways.When the story opens Claudette Colbert is a hard-working single mother.  So is Louise Beavers who offers to work cheap for Colbert because she, too, has a young daughter and is looking for a live-in job that will accept the daughter.  Colbert is delighted and, using Beaver's pancake recipe, make the two women rich in such an over-the-top way that 1934 depression era audiences must have been delighted.  There are complications of course.  As the daughter grow up, each causes her mother problems.  Colbert's daughter falls in love with her mother's boyfriend.  And Beavers daughter is light-skinned enough to pass for white and rejects her mother.  How it all turns out is the stuff of pure melodrama.  It was done so well, however, that I couldn't help but feel real emotion.  Acting was superb and the direction was perfect.  It was timed beautifully and ended with a satisfactory conclusion.Don't miss this classic film if you can.  It shows that a fine script and good drama will always endure.

But that's where the two daughters come into play, as Colbert's daughter begins to envy her mom her new boyfriend, Warren William, and Beavers' light-skinned daughter tries to break away from her mom by passing as white.

59619,A2R6RA8FRBS608,0783227647,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","Imitation of Life is a well done film with great acting especially by Louise Beavers and Claudette Colbert--although the others do a great job acting, too! This film gave Louise Beavers, an African-American actress, a meaty roll to play at a time when blacks were almost invariably restricted to playing butlers or maids with a mere eight or nine lines during the entire picture. It's a shame African-American actors and actresses were treated this way; but this film was made decades before black became beautiful along with the civil rights movement. Blacks had ""to know their place."" Sigh...The cinematography and choreography are good and the musical score enhances the film, too. The plot moves along nicely without ever being too slow or too fast. Indeed, as the film progressed I was increasingly interested to see how things would work out. Unfortunately, however, the film definitely needs to be restored. For example, there are a few grainy scenes and that's a disappointment.When the action starts, we quickly meet widowed single mother Beatrice 'Bea' Pullman (Claudette Colbert) who is raising her three year old daughter Jessie (Juanita Quigley) alone; Bea drops Jessie off at a day nursery as she peddles maple syrup but business is slow because of the depression. One day, Delilah Johnson (Louise Beavers) knocks on Bea's door, thinking Bea placed an ad in the paper for a ""girl"" to do housework. At first Bea tries to help Delilah and Delilah's daughter Peola get to the household that placed the ad for hired help; but Delilah shows Bea just how helpful she can be as a maid and Bea hires Delilah even though Bea can't pay much--Bea even lets Delilah and Peola stay with her so they won't be on the streets!Bea also enjoys Delilah's pancakes--so much so, in fact, that Bea rents a shop on the boardwalk and Bea does most of the cooking. They now live in the back of the shop but there's trouble; Peola wants desperately to ""pass"" for white since she's a very light skinned black girl. Peola is ashamed of her black mother and even hates Delilah and this causes big problems.In addition, two men enter the scene--Elmer Smith (Ned Sparks) who gives Bea the idea to mass market Delilah's pancake flour and Stephen 'Steve' Archer (Warren William) who becomes Bea's love interest pretty quickly. It also isn't long before Delilah and Bea get rich from marketing the pancake flour even though Delilah can't stand the idea of having any money of her own; she feels she must be subservient to Bea and Jessie--this and a few other things in the plot make this film embarrassingly dated.Of course much more happens; I've already left some things out to avoid spoilers! Suffice it to say that as the film progresses huge personal issues must be confronted and dealt with. For example, when 18 year old Jessie (now played by Rochelle Hudson) meets Steve, she falls for Steve at the same time that her mother Bea loves him, too!Look also for Sebie Hendricks as 4 year old Peola; Fredi Washington to play 19 year old Peola; Dorothy Black as 35 year old Peola; Alan Hale as the ""furniture man;"" Henry Armetta as the painter and Wyndham Standing as Jarvis, Bea's butler.I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; and people who like dramas with social and cultural themes will not be disappointed. I can only hope that the film is restored in the near future.",4,"""Look at me. Am I not white?

Based on the novel by Fannie Hurst, Stahl's quiet understated approach to the subject matter is less heavy handed in its use of melodrama than Sirk's (though Sirk is widely regarded as the master in this medium). To be sure, Sirk amplifies the melodrama to underscore racial prejudice and materialism but, to the contemporary eye, his exaggerations seem more garish than genius, more indoctrinated than inspired.THE TRANSFERS: Stahl's B&amp;W photography holds up remarkably well. But Universal's transfer is rather weak in spots, showing considerable signs of age throughout. Contrast levels are unusually low while black levels are weak. Fine detail is lost in film grain. The B&amp;W film is presented full frame - as it should be.Sirk's color version is a genuine visual disappointment. Colors are faded, dated and muddy. There is a haze across many of the scenes taking place outside. Film grain is excessive. Many scenes appear overly soft to down right blurry. There's a bit of smearing and bleeding of colors in several scenes. Contrast levels are weak. Fine details disappear during the darkest scenes and are never fully realized in brightly lit scenes either. This version is anamorphic widescreen as it should be. The audio for both films is BIG FAT MONO.EXTRAS: None.BOTTOM LINE: Not a very impressive effort from Universal to say the least. There's little to recommend the films as such.

59631,AVL5IDEE8YA3D,0783227647,Rachel McElhany,"[1, 1]","I reviewed ""Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?"" by Beverly Daniel Tatum. In the chapter called Identity Development in Multiracial Families she writes that, ""The stereotype of the `tragic mulatto' - as portrayed in the classic film Imitation of Life, for example - is one of marginality and maladjustment."" I thought it would be interesting to watch the film to gain a better understanding of what she was writing about.The 1934 movie stars Claudette Colbert as Bea Pullman, a widow who is struggling to make ends meet after taking over her late husband's maple syrup business. One day Delilah Johnson (Louise Beavers) shows up at her door with her young daughter Peola looking for a job as a housekeeper. She offers to work for Bea for no pay, just room and board. One day, Delilah makes delicious pancakes for Bea, using her secret family recipe. Bea loves the pancakes so much, she opens a pancake house to sell them. Eventually, she and Delilah go into business selling pancake mix and they become wealthy.While all this is going on, Peola is struggling. Even though her mother is a dark skinned black person, Peola is light enough that she can pass for white. (Delilah tells Bea at the beginning of the movie that Peola's father is very light too.) Peola is ashamed of being black and passes for white whenver she can. Of course, she is outed whenever her mother shows up unexpectedly somewhere, which happens quite often. She grows to resent her mother because of this.It's interesting to view this film through the lens of today's world. Delilah is very much the stereotypical Mammy character. She wants nothing more than to serve Bea and take care of her. Even after Bea gives her a twenty percent interest in the business, Delilah tells Bea to just keep all her earnings for her. She doesn't want her own home or car, she just wants to keep living with Bea. (And why does she only get a twenty percent interest? It's her pancake recipe and her face on the box!) When Bea comments that Peola is smarter than Bea's daughter Jessie, Delilah says something to the effect of we're all born smart, we get dumb later on. It was somewhat unclear to me if she's talking about the black race or the human race but it sounded like she was just speaking about black people.There are just a handful of scenes that are focused on Peola and her struggles. In this film the main plot is Bea's business and her romance with Steve Archer (Warren William). The kissing scenes in this movie were hilarious. They didn't pucker up so much as just smash closed mouths together. Is that how everyone kissed back then? My husband and I tried to kiss that way for fun after watching this movie and were cracking up. But I digress...I didn't think that Peola's subplot had that much depth. She talks about wanting to be white but doesn't talk about why. Perhaps that would have been too much for a film to delve into in the 1930s. When Peola and Jessie are in elementary school, Peola comes home from school crying because Jessie called her black. Bea asks Jessie why she would say such a horrible thing and gives her a stern talking to. I thought that was really interesting that ""black"" would be considered an insult or slur back then but ""colored"" was not.Fredi Washington, the actress who played Peola as an adult, was a green-eyed, light skinned black woman. Ironically, she was encouraged to pass for white by studio heads so she could be cast in more roles but unlike Peola, she refused to pass. She was a fantastic actress but unfortunately there weren't many roles for a light-skinned black person back then. For some of her roles she had to wear makeup to darken her appearance.This was an eye-opening film for me and I think anyone interested in the history of race relations in the United States would find it very interesting to watch.",4,Imitation of Life 1934,1342137600,"07 13, 2012",2012,3857,"['reviewed', 'Why', 'Are', 'Black', 'Kids', 'Sitting', 'Together', 'Cafeteria', 'Beverly', 'Daniel', 'Tatum', 'chapter', 'called', 'Identity', 'Development', 'Multiracial', 'Families', 'stereotype', 'tragic', 'mulatto', 'portrayed', 'classic', 'film', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'example', 'one', 'marginality', 'maladjustment', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'watch', 'film', 'gain', 'better', 'understanding', 'what', 'was', 'writing', 'about.The', '1934', 'movie', 'stars', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'Bea', 'Pullman', 'widow', 'who', 'struggling', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'taking', 'over', 'late', 'husband', 'maple', 'syrup', 'business', 'One', 'day', 'Delilah', 'Johnson', 'Louise', 'Beavers', 'up', 'door', 'young', 'daughter', 'Peola', 'looking', 'job', 'housekeeper', 'work', 'Bea', 'pay', 'just', 'room', 'board', 'One', 'day', 'Delilah', 'delicious', 'pancakes', 'Bea', 'using', 'secret', 'family', 'recipe', 'Bea', 'pancakes', 'so', 'much', 'pancake', 'house', 'sell', 'Eventually', 'Delilah', 'go', 'business', 'selling', 'pancake', 'mix', 'become', 'wealthy.While', 'going', 'Peola', 'struggling', 'Even', 'mother', 'dark', 'skinned', 'black', 'person', 'Peola', 'light', 'enough', 'can', 'pass', 'white', 'Delilah', 'Bea', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Peola', 'father', 'very', 'light', 'too', 'Peola', 'ashamed', 'being', 'black', 'passes', 'white', 'whenver', 'can', 'course', 'outed', 'whenever', 'mother', 'up', 'unexpectedly', 'somewhere', 'quite', 'often', 'resent', 'mother', 'this.It', 'interesting', 'view', 'film', 'lens', 'today', 'world', 'Delilah', 'very', 'much', 'stereotypical', 'Mammy', 'character', 'nothing', 'more', 'serve', 'Bea', 'take', 'care', 'Even', 'Bea', 'twenty', 'percent', 'interest', 'business', 'Delilah', 'Bea', 'just', 'keep', 'earnings', ""n't"", 'want', 'own', 'home', 'car', 'just', 'keep', 'living', 'Bea', 'why', 'only', 'get', 'twenty', 'percent', 'interest', 'pancake', 'recipe', 'face', 'box', 'When', 'Bea', 'comments', 'Peola', 'smarter', 'Bea', 'daughter', 'Jessie', 'Delilah', 'something', 'effect', ""'re"", 'born', 'smart', 'get', 'dumb', 'later', 'was', 'somewhat', 'unclear', 'talking', 'black', 'race', 'human', 'race', 'sounded', 'was', 'just', 'speaking', 'black', 'people.There', 'are', 'just', 'handful', 'scenes', 'are', 'focused', 'Peola', 'struggles', 'film', 'main', 'plot', 'Bea', 'business', 'romance', 'Steve', 'Archer', 'Warren', 'William', 'kissing', 'scenes', 'movie', 'were', 'hilarious', 'did', ""n't"", 'pucker', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'just', 'smash', 'closed', 'mouths', 'together', 'how', 'everyone', 'kissed', 'back', 'then', 'husband', 'tried', 'kiss', 'way', 'fun', 'watching', 'movie', 'were', 'cracking', 'up', 'digress', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Peola', 'subplot', 'had', 'much', 'depth', 'wanting', 'be', 'white', ""n't"", 'talk', 'why', 'Perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'delve', '1930s', 'When', 'Peola', 'Jessie', 'are', 'elementary', 'school', 'Peola', 'home', 'school', 'crying', 'Jessie', 'called', 'black', 'Bea', 'Jessie', 'why', 'would', 'say', 'such', 'horrible', 'thing', 'stern', 'talking', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'black', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'insult', 'slur', 'back', 'then', 'colored', 'was', 'not.Fredi', 'Washington', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Peola', 'adult', 'was', 'green-eyed', 'light', 'skinned', 'black', 'woman', 'Ironically', 'was', 'encouraged', 'pass', 'white', 'studio', 'heads', 'could', 'be', 'cast', 'more', 'roles', 'Peola', 'refused', 'pass', 'was', 'fantastic', 'actress', 'unfortunately', 'were', ""n't"", 'many', 'roles', 'light-skinned', 'black', 'person', 'back', 'then', 'roles', 'had', 'wear', 'makeup', 'darken', 'appearance.This', 'was', 'eye-opening', 'film', 'think', 'anyone', 'interested', 'history', 'race', 'relations', 'United', 'States', 'would', 'find', 'very', 'interesting', 'watch']",N/A

It's always a strange experience, in these supposedly enlightened days, to see an earnest attempt from a previous era to depict the conflict of racial prejudice.  Like a lot of '30s films, the sympathy in Imitation of Life is for the &quot;Mammy&quot; character, the motherly black woman who bends with the hardship of being black, comforted only by God's wisdom and protection.  These days, &quot;Mammy&quot; is a racist character, much like a minstrel.  It's hard to know whether the filmmakers took for granted such scenes as Aunt Delilah descending into her basement room while simultaneously the Colbert character ascends to her palatial bedroom, having already exploited her maid's recipe for perfect pancakes and made a fortune (the share of which Delilah forfeits in order to remain Colbert's maid!).  Are the filmmakers making a comment or are they content to endure this woman's submission?  At any rate, the fair-skinned daughter of Aunt Delilah, mortified by her mother's interference as she tries to &quot;pass,&quot; is an excellent portrayal of that kind of dilemma.  Overall, however, the movie is a dated tearjerker (e.g., the black help singing spirituals in the next room as Delilah dies), and none of the marvellous actors can transcend the tyrannical, maudlin story.",2,Anachronism of racial sensitivity.,986169600,"04 2, 2001",2001,1379,"['review', '1930s', 'version', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'not', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'version', 'always', 'strange', 'experience', 'supposedly', 'enlightened', 'days', 'see', 'earnest', 'attempt', 'previous', 'era', 'depict', 'conflict', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'lot', ""'30s"", 'films', 'sympathy', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'quot', 'Mammy', 'quot', 'character', 'motherly', 'black', 'woman', 'who', 'hardship', 'being', 'black', 'comforted', 'only', 'God', 'wisdom', 'protection', 'days', 'quot', 'Mammy', 'quot', 'racist', 'character', 'much', 'minstrel', 'hard', 'know', 'filmmakers', 'took', 'granted', 'such', 'scenes', 'Aunt', 'Delilah', 'descending', 'basement', 'room', 'simultaneously', 'Colbert', 'character', 'palatial', 'bedroom', 'having', 'already', 'exploited', 'maid', 'recipe', 'perfect', 'pancakes', 'made', 'fortune', 'share', 'Delilah', 'forfeits', 'order', 'remain', 'Colbert', 'maid', 'Are', 'filmmakers', 'making', 'comment', 'are', 'content', 'endure', 'woman', 'submission', 'rate', 'fair-skinned', 'daughter', 'Aunt', 'Delilah', 'mortified', 'mother', 'interference', 'quot', 'pass', 'quot', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'kind', 'dilemma', 'Overall', 'however', 'movie', 'dated', 'tearjerker', 'e.g.', 'black', 'help', 'singing', 'spirituals', 'next', 'room', 'Delilah', 'none', 'marvellous', 'actors', 'can', 'transcend', 'tyrannical', 'maudlin', 'story']",N/A
