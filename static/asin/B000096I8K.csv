What the two opponents imagine and hope to be a personal grudge match turns out to be a politically maneuvered competition. The KGB will go to any extreme to see its player win, but it can't do anything about his ill health (though it tries), and the challenger is awarded the prize when the Russian has to withdraw. A taut, psychological thriller made even more bitter by the fact that no matter how competetive the two players are (VERY competetive) they are mere pawns of political maneuverings. Won an Oscar for best foreign film (Swiss).

I wasn't sure I'd be interested in a chess match, but I was quickly engaged in it and my attention didn't wander untill the very interesting and satisfying ending.The main action is the grand champion chess match held in Geneva in 1983, during the Cold War.  The contenders are the reigning grand master, a Soviet citizen, played movingly by Michel Piccoli and his upstart challenger, a defector from the Soviet Union, brilliantly played by Alexandre Arbatz.  It's a match between two individuals who are caught in the greater political contest of the USSR and the free west.Behind the scenes there are the dramas of each individual.  Fromm, the young defector, is obviously disturbed by the condition of his wife, whom he has apparently left behind, and has become a pawn (no pun intended) in the USSR's revenge against him.  This humanizes the somewhat flamboyant Fromm who has appeared cold and arrogant before we understand this situation.  His wife is movingly portrayed by Liv Ullman.Liebskind, the elder player, has his own personal battle, that of his health.  His heart is not good but he is determined to do whatever he can to win the match.  Leslie Caron doesn't have a lot of lines as his devoted wife but she adds a lot by her graceful quiet presence.The film is unpretentious but very well done and is well worth watching.",4,You don't have to love chess to like this,1223769600,"10 12, 2008",2008,1417,"['had', 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'took', 'chance', 'due', 'steller', 'cast', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', ""'d"", 'be', 'interested', 'chess', 'match', 'was', 'quickly', 'engaged', 'attention', 'did', ""n't"", 'wander', 'untill', 'very', 'interesting', 'satisfying', 'ending.The', 'main', 'action', 'grand', 'champion', 'chess', 'match', 'held', 'Geneva', '1983', 'Cold', 'War', 'contenders', 'are', 'reigning', 'grand', 'master', 'Soviet', 'citizen', 'played', 'movingly', 'Michel', 'Piccoli', 'upstart', 'challenger', 'defector', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Alexandre', 'Arbatz', 'match', 'two', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'caught', 'greater', 'political', 'contest', 'USSR', 'free', 'scenes', 'are', 'dramas', 'individual', 'Fromm', 'young', 'defector', 'obviously', 'disturbed', 'condition', 'wife', 'whom', 'apparently', 'left', 'behind', 'become', 'pawn', 'pun', 'intended', 'USSR', 'revenge', 'somewhat', 'flamboyant', 'Fromm', 'who', 'appeared', 'cold', 'arrogant', 'understand', 'situation', 'wife', 'movingly', 'portrayed', 'Liv', 'Ullman.Liebskind', 'elder', 'player', 'own', 'personal', 'battle', 'health', 'heart', 'not', 'good', 'determined', 'do', 'whatever', 'can', 'win', 'match', 'Leslie', 'Caron', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'lines', 'devoted', 'wife', 'lot', 'graceful', 'quiet', 'presence.The', 'film', 'unpretentious', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",Dangerous Moves
