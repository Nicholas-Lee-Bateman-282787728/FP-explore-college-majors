It is also one of the best Martin Lawrence films I have ever seen. I thought that Martin (Lawrence) and Lynn (Whitfield) lit up the screen as Darnell Wright and Brandi Web. One of my favorite quotes of this movie is, &quot;You put your hands on the wrong woman.&quot; That REALLY made me feel good and smile. But the part that REALLY made me feel good and smile was when Brandi (Lynn Whitfield) got even with Darnell (Martin Lawrence) at her home towards the end. Also, I thought that Erica (Malinda Williams) looked VERY beautiful in her prom dress -- Especially with the way she had had her hair done. That sure brings back memories for me. In conclusion, to anyone who's a fan of Martin Lawrence, I recommend this movie. You're in for a LOT of laughs and thrills, so, go out there, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",3,"Hilarious, witty, sexy, suspenseful, and TOTALLY BEAUTIFUL!",995500800,"07 19, 2001",2001,962,"['opinion', 'A', 'THIN', 'LINE', 'BETWEEN', 'LOVE', 'AND', 'HATE', 'hilarious', 'witty', 'sexy', 'suspenseful', 'TOTALLY', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'movie', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'thought', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'Lynn', 'Whitfield', 'lit', 'up', 'screen', 'Darnell', 'Wright', 'Brandi', 'Web', 'One', 'favorite', 'quotes', 'movie', 'quot', 'put', 'hands', 'wrong', 'woman.', 'quot', 'REALLY', 'made', 'feel', 'good', 'smile', 'part', 'REALLY', 'made', 'feel', 'good', 'smile', 'was', 'when', 'Brandi', 'Lynn', 'Whitfield', 'got', 'even', 'Darnell', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'home', 'end', 'Also', 'thought', 'Erica', 'Malinda', 'Williams', 'looked', 'VERY', 'beautiful', 'prom', 'dress', 'Especially', 'way', 'had', 'had', 'hair', 'done', 'sure', 'back', 'memories', 'conclusion', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'recommend', 'movie', ""'re"", 'LOT', 'laughs', 'thrills', 'so', 'go', 'there', 'rent', 'buy', 'back', 'friend', 'watch']",N/A
27986,AOYDLO9B6M9HL,0780613856,greeneink,"[0, 0]","I wouldn't mind watching this movie again and again, because it is Martin Lawrence at his theatrical best. Not as good as ""Bad Boys,"" but he did some stellar acting in Bad Boys, so this movie role was really an excellent choice for him.It is told in reverse chronology and pops like a rubber band in that he (Darnell, played by Lawrence) starts telling his story close to the resolution, pulls you back to the beginning like a rubber band, builds the tension, the rubber band gets tighter and tighter and just when it couldn't possibly get any worse - POP!!He lets the rubber band go and it flies through the air, landing you right back at the starting point before it resolves only moments later.My favorite lines in the movie [paraphrased]:""One night of passion can lead to a lifetime of heartache.""""We're not your babies, your mama's ... we don't need your money or your D**&.""""I sure hope baby lands on her feet. They might be able to fix the hole in her head, but what about the one in her heart.""and""Never say the word 'love' unless you mean it.""The movie had a very good theme, even though the song it originated from was more about a 'cheating man with a woman at home' type of player than it was a 'single and free playa-player'. However, Lawrence puts a heckuva twist on the theme of the song, which is about thin lines or how fast love can turn into hate given the right set of circumstances.More than a combination of Boomerang and Fatal Attraction, ""Thin Line"" goes deeper into the woman's feelings and brings Brandi Webb in as a more sympathetic character than the others.She is hardcore, but not so hardcore that most women won't understand where she is coming from and what made her snap. Pop. You end up feeling sorry for her, because Darnell did play her really wrong; but, she was already a murderess on the edge and he just messed with the wrong one.She killed her husband after catching him in her own home cheating; but she made the death look like an accident by dropping a plugged in juice-filled radio in the tub with him.It had the feel of the classic ""Okay I forgive you..."". NOT.There was Al Green invited to a breakfast of hot grits that ended up giving him third degree burns (real life); there was, in the fictional world, Mrs Charles McCarter kicking the ""sh"" out of her disabled husband--which he deserved for all he had put her through; there was Miss Celie holding a carving knife at the throat of Mr. _______ during Thanksgiving dinner; and there was another one of Tyler Perry's characters throwing the pot of hot grits and simultaneously swinging with a frying pan.Hit and swat, hit and swat ...Anyway, Thin Line is worth a watch if you've never seen it. It is a very well-told twice-told tale, not so much mystery-intriguing as it is raw with the thunderclap of emotions.In My Skin",5,Oldies but Goodies,1341100800,"07 1, 2012",2012,2820,"['would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'movie', 'again', 'again', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'theatrical', 'best', 'Not', 'as', 'good', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'did', 'stellar', 'acting', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'movie', 'role', 'was', 'really', 'excellent', 'choice', 'him.It', 'told', 'reverse', 'chronology', 'pops', 'rubber', 'band', 'Darnell', 'played', 'Lawrence', 'telling', 'story', 'close', 'resolution', 'back', 'beginning', 'rubber', 'band', 'tension', 'rubber', 'band', 'tighter', 'tighter', 'just', 'when', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'get', 'worse', 'POP', 'rubber', 'band', 'go', 'air', 'landing', 'right', 'back', 'starting', 'point', 'only', 'moments', 'later.My', 'favorite', 'lines', 'movie', '[', 'paraphrased', ']', 'One', 'night', 'passion', 'can', 'lead', 'lifetime', 'heartache', ""'re"", 'not', 'babies', 'mama', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'money', 'D**', 'sure', 'hope', 'baby', 'lands', 'feet', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'fix', 'hole', 'head', 'what', 'one', 'heart', 'Never', 'say', 'word', ""'love"", 'mean', 'movie', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'theme', 'even', 'song', 'originated', 'was', 'more', ""'cheating"", 'man', 'woman', 'home', 'type', 'player', 'was', ""'single"", 'free', 'playa-player', 'However', 'Lawrence', 'heckuva', 'twist', 'theme', 'song', 'thin', 'lines', 'how', 'fast', 'love', 'can', 'turn', 'hate', 'given', 'right', 'set', 'circumstances.More', 'combination', 'Boomerang', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'Thin', 'Line', 'deeper', 'woman', 'feelings', 'brings', 'Brandi', 'Webb', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'others.She', 'hardcore', 'not', 'so', 'hardcore', 'most', 'women', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'where', 'coming', 'what', 'made', 'snap', 'Pop', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'Darnell', 'did', 'play', 'really', 'wrong', 'was', 'already', 'murderess', 'edge', 'just', 'messed', 'wrong', 'one.She', 'killed', 'husband', 'catching', 'own', 'home', 'cheating', 'made', 'death', 'look', 'accident', 'dropping', 'plugged', 'juice-filled', 'radio', 'tub', 'him.It', 'had', 'feel', 'classic', 'Okay', 'forgive', 'NOT.There', 'was', 'Al', 'Green', 'invited', 'breakfast', 'hot', 'grits', 'ended', 'up', 'giving', 'third', 'degree', 'burns', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'fictional', 'world', 'Mrs', 'Charles', 'McCarter', 'kicking', 'sh', 'disabled', 'husband', 'deserved', 'had', 'put', 'was', 'Miss', 'Celie', 'holding', 'carving', 'knife', 'throat', 'Mr.', '_______', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'was', 'one', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'characters', 'throwing', 'pot', 'hot', 'grits', 'simultaneously', 'swinging', 'frying', 'pan.Hit', 'swat', 'hit', 'swat', 'Anyway', 'Thin', 'Line', 'watch', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'very', 'well-told', 'twice-told', 'tale', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'mystery-intriguing', 'raw', 'thunderclap', 'emotions.In', 'My', 'Skin']",N/A

27990,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,0780613856,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[1, 2]","This movie is sort of mess and it doesn't get any better with repetitive viewing. The screenplay is credited to four writers, and its unevenness argues that none of them were on the same wavelength. Subplots start but never finish, characters come and go, and even the main storyline can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a morality play, or a thriller. Lead actor Martin Lawrence (in his directorial debut) has a degree of screen presence, but not even his charisma can rescue this clich&eacute;d film from sliding into oblivion.Darnell (Lawrence) is the kind of character who it's easy to dislike. He's a classic womanizer -- the kind of man who keeps a stream of girlfriends waiting at the other end of the phone for his call. For Darnell, the harder a woman is to get, the more she entices him. So when Brandi (Lynn Whitfield), a wealthy real estate agent, turns her nose up at his come-ons, Darnell goes after her with the tenacity of a pit bull. Eventually, he succeeds, but he gets more than he bargained for. When he tries to break things off with Brandi to prove his affection for the high school sweetheart who has come back to town (Regina King), he discovers that Brandi isn't willing to let him go. She'll try anything, including bodily harm, to keep him.Mix Eddie Murphy's `Boomerang' with `Fatal Attraction,' and you get an idea how confused this movie can get. Although Lawrence, who's wearing half-a-dozen hats for this film (Executive Producer, Music Supervisor, Story, Screenplay, Director, and Star), includes a few humorous scenes, there's not enough comedy to leaven the film's slower portions. The dreary setup takes forever, the thriller elements are disappointingly pedestrian, and the climax is formulaic. There is the core of an interesting story here -- what happens when a lothario becomes a victim -- but Lawrence never does more with this plot strand than superficially trace it. There should be a lot transpiring on a psychological level, but the script is content with unbelievable transformations and simple labels. Darnell is the repentant sinner and Brandi is the psycho scorned woman. The film's message -- don't say you love someone unless you mean it -- doesn't have any resonance because, aside from a few cuts and bruises, Darnell never pays a real price for his actions. The ending doesn't have the guts to demand a meaningful sacrifice.`A Thin Line Between Love and Hate' boasts several solid performances. Lawrence is energetic, but never so completely out-of-control that he loses the audience the way Jim Carrey does. Lynn Whitfield occasionally manages to bring hints of humanity to Brandi (the almost- invisible tear on her cheek when Darnell breaks off the relationship is a nice touch). Regina King and Della Reese (as Darnell's mother) are effective in supporting roles. With a more clear notion of what it was trying to do and a shorter, tighter script, this movie could have been worthwhile as a comedy or a thriller, although doubtfully as both.",3,This movie does have its moments,1170288000,"02 1, 2007",2007,3007,"['movie', 'sort', 'mess', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'repetitive', 'viewing', 'screenplay', 'credited', 'four', 'writers', 'unevenness', 'argues', 'none', 'were', 'same', 'wavelength', 'Subplots', 'start', 'never', 'finish', 'characters', 'come', 'go', 'even', 'main', 'storyline', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'be', 'comedy', 'morality', 'play', 'thriller', 'Lead', 'actor', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'directorial', 'debut', 'degree', 'screen', 'presence', 'not', 'even', 'charisma', 'can', 'rescue', 'clich', 'eacute', 'film', 'sliding', 'oblivion.Darnell', 'Lawrence', 'kind', 'character', 'who', 'easy', 'dislike', 'classic', 'womanizer', 'kind', 'man', 'who', 'stream', 'girlfriends', 'waiting', 'other', 'end', 'phone', 'call', 'Darnell', 'harder', 'woman', 'get', 'more', 'So', 'when', 'Brandi', 'Lynn', 'Whitfield', 'wealthy', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'nose', 'up', 'come-ons', 'Darnell', 'tenacity', 'pit', 'bull', 'Eventually', 'more', 'bargained', 'When', 'break', 'things', 'Brandi', 'prove', 'affection', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'who', 'come', 'back', 'town', 'Regina', 'King', 'Brandi', ""n't"", 'willing', 'let', 'go', ""'ll"", 'try', 'anything', 'including', 'bodily', 'harm', 'keep', 'him.Mix', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Boomerang', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'get', 'idea', 'how', 'confused', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'wearing', 'half-a-dozen', 'hats', 'film', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'Music', 'Supervisor', 'Story', 'Screenplay', 'Director', 'Star', 'few', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'not', 'enough', 'comedy', 'leaven', 'film', 'slower', 'portions', 'dreary', 'setup', 'forever', 'thriller', 'elements', 'are', 'disappointingly', 'pedestrian', 'climax', 'formulaic', 'core', 'interesting', 'story', 'here', 'what', 'when', 'lothario', 'victim', 'Lawrence', 'never', 'more', 'plot', 'strand', 'superficially', 'trace', 'should', 'be', 'lot', 'transpiring', 'psychological', 'level', 'script', 'content', 'unbelievable', 'transformations', 'simple', 'labels', 'Darnell', 'repentant', 'sinner', 'Brandi', 'psycho', 'scorned', 'woman', 'film', 'message', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'love', 'someone', 'mean', ""n't"", 'have', 'resonance', 'aside', 'few', 'cuts', 'bruises', 'Darnell', 'never', 'real', 'price', 'actions', 'ending', ""n't"", 'have', 'guts', 'demand', 'meaningful', 'sacrifice.', 'Thin', 'Line', 'Between', 'Love', 'Hate', 'boasts', 'several', 'solid', 'performances', 'Lawrence', 'energetic', 'never', 'so', 'completely', 'out-of-control', 'audience', 'way', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Lynn', 'Whitfield', 'occasionally', 'bring', 'hints', 'humanity', 'Brandi', 'almost-', 'invisible', 'tear', 'cheek', 'when', 'Darnell', 'relationship', 'nice', 'touch', 'Regina', 'King', 'Della', 'Reese', 'Darnell', 'mother', 'are', 'effective', 'supporting', 'roles', 'more', 'clear', 'notion', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'shorter', 'tighter', 'script', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'worthwhile', 'comedy', 'thriller', 'doubtfully']",N/A

It's not Oscar material for sure, but it's good and enjoyable and almost anything that Martin Lawrence is in, is great.  He's funny and yet in this, you can see he's got a more serious side too.  I do agree with some other reviewers that it is a semi cross between Fatal Attraction and Boomerang.  There are moments of comedy and moments of insanity with the female lead.  Darnell meets Brandi outside his club, Chocolate City, and she looks like she has it all.  Limo driver, fine crib in Malibu, good paying job, but that's only the surface.He can't say he wasn't warned.  His mother (Della Reese) said near the start that there is a fine line between love and hate, and also Brandi (Lynn Whitfield) told Darnell that it wouldn't be a good thing if she were hurt and she also told him in bed for their first time, that she'd killed her husband because he'd been abusive.  He should have heard warning bells then, but didn't.I love watching this; it's funny in parts and also fun watching Brandi go off the deep end.

27999,AJK5WHV1GW941,0780613856,Mikeisha Best,"[5, 6]","""A Thin Line Between Love and Hate"" stars Martin Lawrence, Lynn Whitfield, Regina King, Bobby Brown and Della Reese.  This is easily one of my favorite movies; I often watch it when I'm feeling depressed because it eases my mood and reminds me that even though we may face hard times, someone is always going through something worse than you.The movie is a about a player (womanizer) named Darnell who is confident that he can get any woman he wants.  He was able to get women easily, because he was charming and co-owner of a hot club in town, so he was looking for a challenge.  He found that challenge in Brandy Webb. Brandy is not your average female.  She is high maintenance and rich.  She does not deal with men like Darnell, for they are mid-class players.  Darnell wants Brandy badly and goes through a lot to get her.  While he is chasing Brandy, though, his old flame Mia is back in town from the Army.  Darnell still has feelings for, but mind you, he is still chasing Brandy, and Mia is dating a well to do man.  Darnell finally is able to get a date with Brandy, and after spending lots of time with her, he accomplishes his goal and ""hits it"".  After he hits it, he loses interest in Brandy and pursues Mia.  However, Brandy is not going to let Darnell go that easily.  She does all she can to get revenge on Darnell.  The whole while Darnell's mother is warning him about playing women, but he always brushes her off.  In the end, Darnell CERTAINLY learns a lesson.I absolutely love this movie.  The comedic performance is wonderful.  I love the plot.  I have never seen a black movie with this type of plot, so it was different.  Martin Lawrence showed innovation in creating this movie.  It is also neat that he named this movie after the song entitled ""A Thin Line Between Love and Hate"".  The song and movie are about the same subject: ""The sweetest woman in the world can be the meanest woman in the world, if you make her that way"".  This is a line from the song.I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a laugh and some drama.",4,One of my favorite movies...,1129852800,"10 21, 2005",2005,2060,"['Thin', 'Line', 'Between', 'Love', 'Hate', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'Lynn', 'Whitfield', 'Regina', 'King', 'Bobby', 'Brown', 'Della', 'Reese', 'easily', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'often', 'watch', 'when', ""'m"", 'feeling', 'depressed', 'mood', 'even', 'may', 'face', 'hard', 'times', 'someone', 'always', 'going', 'something', 'worse', 'you.The', 'movie', 'player', 'womanizer', 'named', 'Darnell', 'who', 'confident', 'can', 'get', 'woman', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'women', 'easily', 'was', 'charming', 'co-owner', 'hot', 'club', 'town', 'was', 'looking', 'challenge', 'found', 'challenge', 'Brandy', 'Webb', 'Brandy', 'not', 'average', 'female', 'high', 'maintenance', 'rich', 'not', 'deal', 'men', 'Darnell', 'are', 'mid-class', 'players', 'Darnell', 'Brandy', 'badly', 'lot', 'get', 'chasing', 'Brandy', 'though', 'old', 'flame', 'Mia', 'back', 'town', 'Army', 'Darnell', 'still', 'feelings', 'still', 'chasing', 'Brandy', 'Mia', 'dating', 'well', 'do', 'man', 'Darnell', 'finally', 'able', 'get', 'date', 'Brandy', 'spending', 'lots', 'time', 'goal', 'hits', 'interest', 'Brandy', 'pursues', 'Mia', 'However', 'Brandy', 'not', 'going', 'let', 'Darnell', 'go', 'easily', 'can', 'get', 'revenge', 'Darnell', 'whole', 'while', 'Darnell', 'mother', 'warning', 'playing', 'women', 'always', 'off', 'end', 'Darnell', 'CERTAINLY', 'lesson.I', 'absolutely', 'love', 'movie', 'comedic', 'performance', 'wonderful', 'love', 'plot', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'black', 'movie', 'type', 'plot', 'was', 'different', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'showed', 'innovation', 'creating', 'movie', 'also', 'neat', 'named', 'movie', 'song', 'entitled', 'A', 'Thin', 'Line', 'Between', 'Love', 'Hate', 'song', 'movie', 'are', 'same', 'subject', 'sweetest', 'woman', 'world', 'can', 'be', 'meanest', 'woman', 'world', 'make', 'way', 'line', 'song.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'looking', 'laugh', 'drama']",N/A
