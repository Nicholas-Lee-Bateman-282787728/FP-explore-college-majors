The film made absolutely little sense and was so poorly done and written had a ray of hope with Gerard Butler at the end. Yet even his performance was so small and poor you may as well don't even bother to waste your time and anyones on a film that was a total waste of time to begin with. Just plain terrible.

Very violent, with drugs, guns and violence the stars.While it does not have the balletic grace of Woo's slow-motion shooting scenes, nor a star with the charisma of Chow Yun Fat behind the gun, it is a worthy entry into the genre.  The cast acquit themselves well in mostly underwritten roles.  Louis Dempsey is fine as recently released from prison Gilly, who is the voice telling the story.  His friend(?) J is annoying, but Gerard Butler does a crazed violent and vain gun dealer well.The gritty streets, sleazy bars and places these underworld people frequent is shown with the contrast to the home J and his wife and child have but he is already among the living dead, as the narrator says.
