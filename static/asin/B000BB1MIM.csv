The first four seasons simply represent some of the best programing commercial TV has ever had to offer.But to say that there is nothing here worth watching is just hyperbole of the worst sort.  This season offers the episode ""The Supremes"" in which Glenn Close guest stars as a potential Supreme Court nominee.  The way this episode gets resolved is every bit as worthy of the Aaron Sorkin years (which, it might be reminded did have their down moments such as the ""Ishmael and Issac"" episode) as well as story lines that just weren't very good (Sam and the call girl).As for the gripes about the lighting I am amazed that it is season five that gets all the complaints.  The lighting on this show has always been frustratingly dark even during the St. Aaron years -- Leo working at his desk late at night with only one light on in his office?  What was up with that and why are people just now complaining about it?Season five lacks much of what made the first four season so remarkable -- no doubt about it, but the lack or explanation on some plot points is really no different that the characters that simply vanished with no explanation in the St. Aaron years.Virtually any show that has been on the air as long as ""West Wing"" has been starts to shows signs of age even without personnel changes, and if you think that season five is so utterly unwatchable, well then, I guess ""American Idol"" will be right up your alley.",5,"Not Really Worthy of Five Stars, But Just Trying to Counter the Absurd One Star Reviews",1126742400,"09 15, 2005",2005,1523,"['Yeah', 'season', 'six', ""n't"", 'up', 'standards', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'then', 'what', 'are', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'simply', 'represent', 'best', 'programing', 'commercial', 'TV', 'ever', 'had', 'offer.But', 'say', 'nothing', 'here', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'hyperbole', 'worst', 'sort', 'season', 'episode', 'Supremes', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'guest', 'stars', 'potential', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'nominee', 'way', 'episode', 'resolved', 'bit', 'worthy', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'years', 'might', 'be', 'reminded', 'did', 'have', 'down', 'moments', 'such', 'Ishmael', 'Issac', 'episode', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'lines', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'Sam', 'call', 'girl', '.As', 'gripes', 'lighting', 'am', 'amazed', 'season', 'five', 'complaints', 'lighting', 'show', 'always', 'been', 'frustratingly', 'dark', 'even', 'St.', 'Aaron', 'years', 'Leo', 'working', 'desk', 'late', 'night', 'only', 'one', 'light', 'office', 'What', 'was', 'up', 'why', 'are', 'people', 'just', 'now', 'complaining', 'Season', 'five', 'lacks', 'much', 'what', 'made', 'first', 'four', 'season', 'so', 'remarkable', 'doubt', 'lack', 'explanation', 'plot', 'points', 'really', 'different', 'characters', 'simply', 'vanished', 'explanation', 'St.', 'Aaron', 'years.Virtually', 'show', 'been', 'air', 'as', 'long', 'West', 'Wing', 'been', 'starts', 'shows', 'signs', 'age', 'even', 'personnel', 'changes', 'think', 'season', 'five', 'so', 'utterly', 'unwatchable', 'well', 'then', 'guess', 'American', 'Idol', 'will', 'be', 'right', 'alley']",N/A
939320,A20IIR0422G3A5,B000BB1MIM,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[9, 15]","Season 5 of `The West Wing' may be the most gut-wrenching series of shows from all the shows before or since. It begins with the four episode story of the president's daughter, Zoe Bartlett's abduction and ends with the death by terrorist bomb of former Chief of the Joint Staffs, Admiral FitzWallis with critical injuries to the very popular character, Donna Moss, assistant to the Assistant White House Chief of Staff, Josh Lyman.The apotheosis of this season comes early, when President Bartlett invokes the 25th amendment, temporarily removing himself from office, to be replaced by the Speaker of the House, played to a finely honed Tee by John Goodman. I have yet to know why Goodman played this part on three episodes without any cast credit, but it simply heightened the impact of seeing intellectual Bartlett's (Martin Sheen) position taken over by plainspeaking everyman Goodman.The strength of the story line in this season is surprising with the fact that two founding fathers, Aaron Sorkin and Tommy Schlamme are not among the creative contributors. The main difference seems to be the shift from politics to more dramatic topics of crime and terrorism, except that we have, in the middle of the season, the brilliant, chesslike game played out between the Republican congressional leadership on the one hand and Bartlett and prime political advisor Lyman on the other over the approval of the budget.Like so many episodes, this was based on an actual event when President Clinton outmanuvered the Republican congress on some legislative issue, a bit less important than the budget.I can clearly sense a certain overreaching, as the award winning show starts to loose its novelty after five seasons, against the CSI / Law and Order crowd. It also seems to lack some of the light touch brought to the show in the fourth season by the Ainsley Hayes character (assistant White House counsel) or in the sixth season by the White House communications assistant played by Kristen Chenoworth. I also miss the Sam Seaborn character, so ably played by Rob Lowe.This season may also contain the only flaw in characterization which spans more than one episode. I cannot for the life of me appreciate how the first lady would have expected to be told about a seriously clandestine operation, and then be overwhelmingly put out when this event by some great misfortune, comes back to bite the first family. This misreading of human reactions is offset when, in midseason, first lady Bartlett comes back from the New Hampshire farm to get Josh Lyman out of the dog house and set in motion the resolution of the budget crisis in fine political form.For those of you who may have missed this season when it originally aired or in its frequent reincarnations on Bravo, I highly recommend this set as a worthy addition to this epic on American politics. If nothing else, 'The West Wing' does much to clear up the true nature of politics and how it is an enterprise which can be and is often conducted by honorable men.",5,Season has some of the show's best moments!,1133222400,"11 29, 2005",2005,3013,"['Season', '5', 'West', 'Wing', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'gut-wrenching', 'series', 'shows', 'shows', 'four', 'episode', 'story', 'president', 'daughter', 'Zoe', 'Bartlett', 'abduction', 'death', 'terrorist', 'bomb', 'former', 'Chief', 'Joint', 'Staffs', 'Admiral', 'FitzWallis', 'critical', 'injuries', 'very', 'popular', 'character', 'Donna', 'Moss', 'assistant', 'Assistant', 'White', 'House', 'Chief', 'Staff', 'Josh', 'Lyman.The', 'apotheosis', 'season', 'early', 'when', 'President', 'Bartlett', '25th', 'amendment', 'temporarily', 'removing', 'office', 'be', 'replaced', 'Speaker', 'House', 'played', 'finely', 'honed', 'Tee', 'John', 'Goodman', 'have', 'yet', 'know', 'why', 'Goodman', 'played', 'part', 'three', 'episodes', 'cast', 'credit', 'simply', 'heightened', 'impact', 'seeing', 'intellectual', 'Bartlett', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'position', 'taken', 'over', 'plainspeaking', 'everyman', 'Goodman.The', 'strength', 'story', 'line', 'season', 'surprising', 'fact', 'two', 'founding', 'fathers', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'Tommy', 'Schlamme', 'are', 'not', 'creative', 'contributors', 'main', 'difference', 'be', 'shift', 'politics', 'more', 'dramatic', 'topics', 'crime', 'terrorism', 'have', 'middle', 'season', 'brilliant', 'chesslike', 'game', 'played', 'out', 'Republican', 'congressional', 'leadership', 'one', 'hand', 'Bartlett', 'prime', 'political', 'advisor', 'Lyman', 'other', 'approval', 'budget.Like', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', 'was', 'based', 'actual', 'event', 'when', 'President', 'Clinton', 'outmanuvered', 'Republican', 'congress', 'legislative', 'issue', 'bit', 'less', 'important', 'budget.I', 'can', 'clearly', 'sense', 'certain', 'overreaching', 'award', 'winning', 'show', 'loose', 'novelty', 'five', 'seasons', 'CSI', '/', 'Law', 'Order', 'crowd', 'also', 'lack', 'light', 'touch', 'brought', 'show', 'fourth', 'season', 'Ainsley', 'Hayes', 'character', 'assistant', 'White', 'House', 'counsel', 'sixth', 'season', 'White', 'House', 'communications', 'assistant', 'played', 'Kristen', 'Chenoworth', 'also', 'miss', 'Sam', 'Seaborn', 'character', 'so', 'ably', 'played', 'Rob', 'Lowe.This', 'season', 'may', 'also', 'contain', 'only', 'flaw', 'characterization', 'more', 'one', 'episode', 'can', 'not', 'life', 'appreciate', 'how', 'first', 'lady', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'be', 'told', 'seriously', 'clandestine', 'operation', 'then', 'be', 'overwhelmingly', 'put', 'out', 'when', 'event', 'great', 'misfortune', 'back', 'bite', 'first', 'family', 'misreading', 'human', 'reactions', 'offset', 'when', 'midseason', 'first', 'lady', 'Bartlett', 'back', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'farm', 'get', 'Josh', 'Lyman', 'dog', 'house', 'set', 'motion', 'resolution', 'budget', 'crisis', 'fine', 'political', 'form.For', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'season', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'frequent', 'reincarnations', 'Bravo', 'highly', 'recommend', 'set', 'worthy', 'addition', 'epic', 'American', 'politics', 'nothing', 'else', 'West', 'Wing', 'much', 'clear', 'up', 'true', 'nature', 'politics', 'how', 'enterprise', 'can', 'be', 'often', 'conducted', 'honorable', 'men']",N/A

939328,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B000BB1MIM,Craig MACKINNON,"[10, 13]","The unfortunate thing about Season 5 is that many of the most dedicated viewers of The West Wing started watching the show because they were fans of Alan Sorkin.  There was an automatic knee-jerk reaction against the new regime on the show, perhaps understandably so in light of the early episodes.  However, once they got settled in, the new writers managed to turn out some of the best episodes (including my personal favourite) of the entire series.The season starts with a new ""president,"" former speaker of the house Glenallen Walken, a blustering militaristic Republican who was brought in to help the country through the kidnapping of President Bartlett's daughter Zoey.  The kidnapping cliffhanger of Season 4 was the best cliffhanger episode of the series, and if the payoff isn't quite as good, it's still gripping.  John Goodman as Walken is one of the best guest stars the show has had, embodying an almost stereotypical member of the GOP, yet infusing a convincing degree of reality to the part.  The series then continues with a depressing and overly drawn-out series of episodes containing a showdown between the new speaker of the House (a young and obnoxious Republican) and the White House over a budget appropriation bill.  The season (and the series) almost goes off the rails for good in this storyline, wherein our favourite characters are repeatedly kicked and bullied for 4 straight episodes.  Josh fares especially badly, which must have really angered the Sorkin purists, who remember that the show was originally supposed to focus on Josh, Sam, and the other junior members of the administration.  Josh does redeem himself with a ""publicity stunt"" that ends this set of shows on a high note, but it doesn't really make up for the drudgery we've had to plod through to get to the resolution.Fortunately, the series then picks up dramatically.  There follows a series of 1-off episodes, many of which are among my favourite of the entire series.  One subject dear to my own heart, as a scientist, is the episode Eppur Si Muove (named for a quote by Galileo), where Eli's supervisor's funding is cut off because he is investigating the transmission of a sexually transmitted disease, not a ""respectable"" disease in the eyes of some lawmakers on the Hill.  It is eerily prescient of the current Bush administration's interference in research, cutting off funding for projects deemed as valueless in the ""War"" against terrorism.  The point is made that independent research is necessary to find the big ideas - superconductivity, the structure of DNA, silicon microchips, etc. were discovered because the scientists looking at the problems were free to direct their research as they saw fit, without political interference.Other highlights of the season include ""The Supremes,"" my all-time favourite West Wing episode, guest starring Glenn Close as a candidate for a vacant Supreme Court seat.  ""Full Disclosure"" has C.J. sparring with former VP Hoynes over a new tell-all book, in which he attempts to paint himself in the best light possible (to the detriment of the Bartletts and their staff).  ""The Warfare of Ghengis Khan"" follows the joint stories of an unattributed nuclear test in the Indian Ocean and Josh sparring with NASA administrators over space exploration (another great science-based episode).  ""The Stormy Present"" brings back John Goodman and brings in James Cromwell as former presidents attending a state funeral.  And ""Han"" gives us a world-renowned North Korean pianist who asks for political asylum in the U.S. on the eve of a sensitive nuclear arms negotiation with Pyongyang.The season then concludes with the ""third rail"" (""touch it and you die"") of foreign policy - the Israel-Palistine conflict.  In what is the weakest series cliffhanger to date, a congressional delegation (including Admiral Fitzwallace and Donna as observers, and Toby's wife, Congresswoman Wyatt) is attacked by terrorists.  A roadside bomb hits their motorcade (apparently deliberately targetted), setting off a crisis in the Middle East.  While I applaud the ability of the writers to bring clarity to the issue (including the distrust felt by the administration over the thinly veiled Yassar Arafat-esque chairman of the Palastinian Authority), there is little tension for our main characters, as we learn before the season ends who lives and dies as a result of the explosion.  Thus, the ""cliffhanger"" part is nothing more than a political/intellegence mistep by Bartlett (and an international one, at that), hardly in the same league as Zoey's kidnapping of the season before, or the assassination attempt at the end of Season 1.Overall, the middle is very good, the end is a little weak, and there is a 4-show set near the beginning of the season that is best forgotten.  As usual, there are few extras, and so I'll include my standard plea - why can't we have political scientists comment on the show in audio commentaries?  This would be the perfect opportunity to showcase the intellegence of the writing and foster debate about issues like the Arab-Israeli conflict, social security, the vetting process of appointing judges, etc.  Instead, we get mild and bland commentaries on the making of the shows.  What a waste of an opportunity.",4,"Plodding at the beginning, but improves greatly as the season progressed",1159056000,"09 24, 2006",2006,5268,"['unfortunate', 'thing', 'Season', '5', 'many',

I wasn't sure about the fifth season for the reason everyone knows.  So, I borrowed the fifth season to see first and buy later.  Well, buy later part is not going to happen.  I thought the first 15 shows were good.  They did a good job with the characters and the storyline.  However, something happened.  It started with the show ""Access"".  They either ran out of ideas or wasn't sure what to do next.  They didn't know how to focus on different characters, so they brought in someone else to be the focal point (well, almost the focal point).  Also, the storyline was weak.  No issues or adjenda of any importance.  Here are my complaints about the last five shows:1.  The writer is trying to be funny instead of letting the characters entertain us.  I enjoyed the quick thinking and spur of the moment incidents which brought smiles to the viewers.  However, the president throwing a baseball in a middle of major crisis and emptying out the press room, they were reaching for some cheap laughs.2.  Emptying the pressroom ties to my next complaint.  There were some out of character moments.  Like when CJ tries to expose FCC.  She took the issue to the press without Leo or the President's knowledge.  When did she become a crusader for a single cause.  She always voiced her opinion, but that was it.3.  They started to drift away from reality.  One moment, a kid is Josh's intern.  The next day, his is representing a senator arguing with Josh on a issue.  Honestly, is this possible?  The aide and the secretary are getting very powerful.  They can question senior officials while they are briefing the President.  I guess that is possible too.  The final straw was the fact they brought in a new character to be the whitehouse NSC liaison officer.  Ten days into the job, she is making decisions, arguing with the senior officials (including Leo), and advising the Presidents on a major issue.  I understand Nancy is out of the country, but don't they have a second in command? Assistance Director?  Deputy Director?  Someone!!!  Apparently, everyone is against her ideas and recommendations, but the President is only listening to her and having her around everywhere he goes.  I guess that could happen.Well, I know this is only a tv show, but after four years of greatness, I did not like how the last five shows ended in Season five.Oh well, take it for what its worth.  As I said before, I just couldn't stand the last five shows.  Check it out for yourself.

Things started to slide down the predictable path once he left and the remaining writers began to follow formulas that work for other shows. Sorkin had a fantastic way of balancing politics during the first four seasons. Both Republicans and Democrats had their quirks, but was able to demonstrate repeatedly that both parties were made up of good people trying to serve. The show started to slide towards the end of season 4, and the spiral continues more severely in the fifth season. Typical of the loss of someone with vision like Sorkin, new characters are introduced, multi-episode battles that don't make sense to most involved and a shuffling of responsibilities and positions begins and continues even more drastically in the sixth season. There is also a feeling that many of the characters weren't properly set into the roles that they were being introduced for and the reason for them being there wavers and lacks focus and definition.The West Wing is one of those shows I wish could come back, continuing another presidential term with a new president who would highlight completely different and relevant issues that speak to all Americans. Sadly, shows as great as this are no longer with us.Overall the fifth season is solid, but weaker than the first four. I feel as if the show didn't jump the shark until the sixth season so there is still much enjoyment to be had.

Season five came after the departure of writer, creator Aaron Sorkin. Thomas Schlamme remained only as a consultant.The series suffers also from the departure of Rob Lowe as Sam Seaborne.But the West Wing on a bad year is still good tv, and if you got sucked in by the first four years or reruns of the show, season five is still worth it to get to the last two seasons.Sam is gone and Will Bailey (played by Josh Malina) has taken over as Deputy Communications Director.  Richard Schiff's Toby Ziegler, never Mr. Glad-n-Happy, at least entertained us with sarcastic wit as long as the words were supplied by Aaron Sorkin DeBergerac.  In this season Toby just seems a dark and gloomy grump, although Toby achieves perhaps his greatest political accomplishment working behind the scenes to join both Republicans and Democrats in a measure to ""save"" social security (since it seems inevitably headed toward financial ruin.)Bradley Whitford is still a legislative bulldog as Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman.  The late John Spencer is still the White House rock as Chief of Staff Leo McGarry.  Allison Janney's Claudia Jean Cregg remains a strong and compassionate character, and Janney won the last of her four West Wing Emmies this season.  Dule Hill makes Charlie Young even wiser and more mature as the President's body man and Martin Sheen keeps the show above water as President Josiah Bartlett.The loss of Sorkin hurts the series both from a loss of snappy dialogue and a lack of narrative arc as many episodes have superficial connection to anything else in the West Wing Universe.It looks like the West Wing and it's still good, but the flat writing make the shows look as if the performers are sleep-walking.",4,Perhaps the worst Season - Still rates 4 stars,1234483200,"02 13, 2009",2009,1812,"['Sorkin-Schlamme', 'years', 'West', 'Wing', 'were', 'scintillating', 'glittering', 'gripping', 'television', 'Season', 'five', 'came', 'departure', 'writer', 'creator', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'Thomas', 'Schlamme', 'remained', 'only', 'consultant.The', 'series', 'suffers', 'also', 'departure', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'Sam', 'Seaborne.But', 'West', 'Wing', 'bad', 'year', 'still', 'good', 'tv', 'got', 'sucked', 'first', 'four', 'years', 'reruns', 'show', 'season', 'five', 'still', 'worth', 'get', 'last', 'two', 'seasons.Sam', 'gone', 'Will', 'Bailey', 'played', 'Josh', 'Malina', 'taken', 'over', 'Deputy', 'Communications', 'Director', 'Richard', 'Schiff', 'Toby', 'Ziegler', 'never', 'Mr.', 'Glad-n-Happy', 'least', 'entertained', 'sarcastic', 'wit', 'as', 'long', 'words', 'were', 'supplied', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'DeBergerac', 'season', 'Toby', 'just', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'grump', 'Toby', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'political', 'accomplishment', 'working', 'scenes', 'join', 'Republicans', 'Democrats', 'measure', 'save', 'social', 'security', 'inevitably', 'headed', 'financial', 'ruin', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'still', 'legislative', 'bulldog', 'Deputy', 'Chief', 'Staff', 'Josh', 'Lyman', 'late', 'John', 'Spencer', 'still', 'White', 'House', 'rock', 'Chief', 'Staff', 'Leo', 'McGarry', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'Claudia', 'Jean', 'Cregg', 'strong', 'compassionate', 'character', 'Janney', 'won', 'last', 'four', 'West', 'Wing', 'Emmies', 'season', 'Dule', 'Hill', 'Charlie', 'Young', 'even', 'wiser', 'more', 'mature', 'President', 'body', 'man', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'show', 'above', 'water', 'President', 'Josiah', 'Bartlett.The', 'loss', 'Sorkin', 'series', 'loss', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'lack', 'narrative', 'arc', 'many', 'episodes', 'have', 'superficial', 'connection', 'anything', 'else', 'West', 'Wing', 'Universe.It', 'West', 'Wing', 'still', 'good', 'flat', 'writing', 'make', 'shows', 'look', 'performers', 'are', 'sleep-walking']",N/A

This season is a drudgery to watch, an appeal to the action movie crowd.The dialogue fares no better. In the early years West Wing made an attempt, however weak at times, to show both sides of the coin so the viewer could reasonably understand how each of the opposing sides could hold those views. By this point in the show's devolution that effort has been discarded and content is generally replaced with one-sided advocacy; some of the scenes should bear subtitles stating, ""this is a paid political advertisement"". You can visualize the character stepping forward to the edge of the stage to bellow another hamfisted soliloquoy.

The absence of creator and scriptwriter Sorkin lef the series aimless and directionless. Charaters made about-turns in their actions which were completely unrelated to their established personalities. Worst of all however, the script writing lost the sizzle and panache that it seems only Sorkin could provide. The stories became lumbering, they ceased to involve the audience in the action.

Not since Mash has there been a better vehicle for the small screen to make such a poignant use of the video airwaves, raising the bar for both sides, giving us a long look at what our government is supposed to be, and how it is supposed to be run. Caring, honest, intelligent people governing for the basic good of the whole population.As a writer want-to-be, I am amazed at the accuracy and overall knowledge that went in to the script-writing. Bringing real life storylines right from the front page headlines to our television sets, as if we were a ""fly-on-the-wall"" in the Oval Office. Not covering up and hiding, but facing ""head-on"" the scandals that have corrupted and brought down countless Presidencies and high level politicos. In a time when our country is in peril of darkness and our government can't come together to agree on turning on the lights, we have been given an owners manual, ""American Government For Dummies"" a/k/a ""The West Wing"" seasons I to VII. These actors, playing their roles with a sincerity and believability that would make you write in their names on a ballot and vote for them in real life, deliver the government back to the American People, where it belongs. If our real Politicians were as caring and as honest as these characters have been written to be, there would be no close elections. To borrow a line from an earlier West Wing episode,""The people are fed up with having to vote for the candidate that they dislike the least"".Once upon a time, being a politician was a ""Call to Duty"", much the same as joining the military or becoming a teacher. You wern't in it for the money or the fame. You put in long hours and scrificed time with friends and family for very low pay, you were doing your duty to God and Country for your fellow Countrymen. The West Wing Series reiterates that ""Call To Duty"", as the actors demonstrate the long hours and lack of personal time, in the day to day running of our country.I urge you to buy and watch the entire 7 seasons in order, the knowledge and entertainment are without compare.",5,Five Seasons and going Strong,1279238400,"07 16, 2010",2010,2237,"['show', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'Americans', 'Democrat', 'Republican', 'elephant', 'ass', 'story', 'script', 'American', 'political', 'experience', 'Not', 'Mash', 'there', 'been', 'better', 'vehicle', 'small', 'screen', 'make', 'such', 'poignant', 'use', 'video', 'airwaves', 'raising', 'bar', 'sides', 'giving', 'long', 'look', 'what', 'government', 'supposed', 'be', 'how', 'supposed', 'be', 'run', 'Caring', 'honest', 'intelligent', 'people', 'governing', 'basic', 'good', 'whole', 'population.As', 'writer', 'want-to-be', 'am', 'amazed', 'accuracy', 'overall', 'knowledge', 'went', 'script-writing', 'Bringing', 'real', 'life', 'storylines', 'right', 'front', 'page', 'headlines', 'television', 'sets', 'were', 'fly-on-the-wall', 'Oval', 'Office', 'Not', 'covering', 'up', 'hiding', 'facing', 'head-on', 'scandals', 'have', 'corrupted', 'brought', 'down', 'countless', 'Presidencies', 'high', 'level', 'politicos', 'time', 'when', 'country', 'peril', 'darkness', 'government', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'together', 'agree', 'turning', 'lights', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'owners', 'manual', 'American', 'Government', 'Dummies', 'West', 'Wing', 'seasons', 'VII', 'actors', 'playing', 'roles', 'sincerity', 'believability', 'would', 'make', 'write', 'names', 'ballot', 'vote', 'real', 'life', 'deliver', 'government', 'back', 'American', 'People', 'where', 'real', 'Politicians', 'were', 'caring', 'as', 'honest', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'be', 'would', 'be', 'no', 'close', 'elections', 'borrow', 'line', 'earlier', 'West', 'Wing', 'episode', 'people', 'are', 'fed', 'up', 'having', 'vote', 'candidate', 'dislike', 'least', '.Once', 'time', 'being', 'politician', 'was', 'Call', 'Duty', 'much', 'same', 'joining', 'military', 'becoming', 'teacher', 'wer', ""n't"", 'money', 'fame', 'put', 'long', 'hours', 'scrificed', 'time', 'friends', 'family', 'very', 'low', 'pay', 'were', 'doing', 'duty', 'God', 'Country', 'fellow', 'Countrymen', 'West', 'Wing', 'Series', 'Call', 'Duty', 'actors', 'demonstrate', 'long', 'hours', 'lack', 'personal', 'time', 'day', 'day', 'running', 'country.I', 'urge', 'buy', 'watch', 'entire', '7', 'seasons', 'order', 'knowledge', 'entertainment', 'are', 'compare']",N/A

Executive producer John Wells and his creative team must have been overwhelmed by the Season Five transition. Sorkin's absence is obvious when characters we have come to know and admire become wildly inconsistent. From a technical standpoint, Wells' biggest error was the infuriatingly dark lighting - a short-lived artistic miscalculation. Some good episodes remain (notably ""The Dogs of War,"" ""Separation of Powers,"" ""Shutdown"" and ""The Supremes""), but even the best moments lack the dramatic spark and crisp dialogue of the Sorkin years. The first-rate acting ensemble works hard to alleviate the sudden decline.

Anyone who knows Sorkin's work knows that it has a quality to it (once described by a close friend of mine as Sorkin'esque).  The writing under Sorkin was fast paced, intelligent, and in the end had an almost ""feel good"" quality to it.  What's more, Sorkin had a way of showing the dignity of public service.  To be fair, Sorkin had gone off the liberal end and had a tendency to lose track of characters he wrote in (Mandy, Ainsley Hayes).  That said, Season 5 represented a huge drop off in quality.  You knew it could never reach the quality of the prior 4 seasons, but no one knew just how bad it would be.  The show slowed down in a major way, dumbed down, lost the comedy, and lost track of what the West Wing was all about.  The show rebounded a little in Season 6, and went out pretty decently in Season 7.  Out of 7 total seasons, Season 5 ranks #7 in quality, and that's being kind (I could joke that it was 8th in a 7 season race).Buy this ONLY if you want to complete your collection.

This is most evident in the first half of the series. Sadly it is this element to the series that robs it of it's previous dynamism and detracts from the stories being told. This may be down to new script writers after the departure of Sorkin, who created the show, but whatever it is, `The West Wing' has lost some of its bite. Saying that, it's bite was so ferocious before that it still manages to pack quite a considerable punch and turn out griping political drama. This series looks at the Presidents return to power after he relinquished it during his daughters kidnapping, a Budget crisis that shuts the government down, a Tornado and it's aftermath, Supreme court appointments (this was one of my favourite episodes and features Glenn Close), a Chemical attack on the Oval office, an eventful delegation to Gaza and the obligatory end of season cliff hanger. There is also a faux Access All Areas episode that follows CJ and although I commend the series for trying new things, unfortunately it falls flat and is the least enjoyable episode of the series. There is also an episode directed by Richard Schiff (the actor who plays Toby Ziegler) which is very well done. Overall, although this series is lacking some of the elements that made the first three so powerful, this is still highly polished and engaging TV and if you like political drama and enjoyed the preceding series`, then this will still delight.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",4,West Wing 5,1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,1676,"['fifth', 'series', 'West', 'Wing', 'Bartlett', 'administration', 'hampered', 'dominant', 'Republican', 'congress', 'have', 'fight', 'tooth', 'nail', 'law', 'action', 'make', 'most', 'evident', 'first', 'half', 'series', 'Sadly', 'element', 'series', 'previous', 'dynamism', 'detracts', 'stories', 'being', 'told', 'may', 'be', 'down', 'new', 'script', 'writers', 'departure', 'Sorkin', 'who', 'created', 'show', 'West', 'Wing', 'lost', 'bite', 'Saying', 'bite', 'was', 'so', 'ferocious', 'still', 'pack', 'quite', 'considerable', 'punch', 'turn', 'out', 'griping', 'political', 'drama', 'series', 'Presidents', 'return', 'power', 'relinquished', 'daughters', 'kidnapping', 'Budget', 'crisis', 'government', 'down', 'Tornado', 'aftermath', 'Supreme', 'court', 'appointments', 'was', 'one', 'favourite', 'episodes', 'features', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Chemical', 'attack', 'Oval', 'office', 'eventful', 'delegation', 'Gaza', 'obligatory', 'end', 'season', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'also', 'faux', 'Access', 'All', 'Areas', 'episode', 'CJ', 'commend', 'series', 'trying', 'new', 'things', 'unfortunately', 'flat', 'least', 'enjoyable', 'episode', 'series', 'also', 'episode', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Schiff', 'actor', 'who', 'Toby', 'Ziegler', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Overall', 'series', 'lacking', 'elements', 'made', 'first', 'three', 'so', 'powerful', 'still', 'highly', 'polished', 'engaging', 'TV', 'like', 'political', 'drama', 'enjoyed', 'preceding', 'series', 'then', 'will', 'still', 'delight.Feel', 'free', 'check', 'out', 'blog', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'profile', 'page']",N/A
