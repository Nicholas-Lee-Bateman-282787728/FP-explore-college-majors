263314,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6301720555,Acute Observer,"[3, 4]","The film begins with an aerial view of New York city. A man wants a better paying job, he rides the New Haven railroad to his home in Connecticut (tax advantage?). They receive bad news about an inheritance. Betsy is unhappy in their house. Has Tommy changed since the war? Later he has a flashback to the war and his time in Italy. The war killed off many men. Captain Tom is generous to Maria. There are scenes from the 1950s. Tom takes a test for that new job. He remembers the war agains and the parachute drop. Tom was affected by the death of a friend. [The salary dates this film.] There is a large amount of mental health patients; what can be done? Hopkins' daughter runs with a wild crowd; what can be done?Betsy offers Tom advice on salary negotiations. [The cowboy television shows of that era are mocked.] Tom will gather the facts from research so Ralph Hopkins can write a speech for the medical convention. Will there be trouble over Grandma's house? Ralph talks to his daughter Susan about money. Is she spoiled? Does Tom have a problem at work? Or with that house? Can Tom tell the truth in that speech? Does dependency result in less honesty and courage? Do small towns have less privacy? A phone call allows Ralph to show his diplomatic skills. Tom gives his honest opinion about the speech, and makes suggestions for improvements. Ralph explains what makes big successful companies, its not done by 9 to 5 workers. An old army buddy tells Tom about Maria and her boy. Does that cowboy show on television enchant the children? [Is it mentally healthy?]Tom tells all to Betsy, and she responds. Is there a problem with honesty? Should a person dine when emotional? Tom decides his family comes first in place of the company. Hopkins accepts his decision. [What would you do?] Tom and Betsy arrange payments to be sent to Maria. And so the film has a happy ending. [It is a slow-moving drama that is concerned with the psychology of the characters.] This film presents a view of life in the 1950s when small businesses were being killed off to benefit large corporations and their wealthy owners. Small businesses keep the wealth locally, large businesses drain wealth away to New York and other financial centers. Tom's decision says something about small businesses. An owner-operator does not have to choose between family and business because they are about the same. The wife and children help to run things on a farm or family business. Everyone who works for a corporation has to decide about family and business.Note that Tom functions as a personal servant to the owner, he is not involved in advertising or sales. [Was the increase in mental health patients the result of big corporations killing off small businesss? The depression of 2008 seems to have similar effects.]",5,The Analysis of a Company Man,1238803200,"04 4, 2009",2009,2800,"['film', 'aerial', 'view', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'man', 'better', 'paying', 'job', 'New', 'Haven', 'railroad', 'home', 'Connecticut', 'tax', 'advantage', 'receive', 'bad', 'news', 'inheritance', 'Betsy', 'unhappy', 'house', 'Has', 'Tommy', 'changed', 'war', 'Later', 'flashback', 'war', 'time', 'Italy', 'war', 'killed', 'off', 'many', 'men', 'Captain', 'Tom', 'generous', 'Maria', 'are', 'scenes', '1950s', 'Tom', 'test', 'new', 'job', 'war', 'agains', 'parachute', 'drop', 'Tom', 'was', 'affected', 'death', 'friend', '[', 'salary', 'dates', 'film', ']', 'large', 'amount', 'mental', 'health', 'patients', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'Hopkins', 'daughter', 'wild', 'crowd', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'Betsy', 'Tom', 'advice', 'salary', 'negotiations', '[', 'cowboy', 'television', 'shows', 'era', 'are', 'mocked', ']', 'Tom', 'will', 'gather', 'facts', 'research', 'so', 'Ralph', 'Hopkins', 'can', 'write', 'speech', 'medical', 'convention', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'trouble', 'Grandma', 'house', 'Ralph', 'talks', 'daughter', 'Susan', 'money', 'spoiled', 'Does', 'Tom', 'have', 'problem', 'work', 'house', 'Can', 'Tom', 'tell', 'truth', 'speech', 'Does', 'dependency', 'result', 'less', 'honesty', 'courage', 'Do', 'small', 'towns', 'have', 'less', 'privacy', 'phone', 'call', 'Ralph', 'show', 'diplomatic', 'skills', 'Tom', 'honest', 'opinion', 'speech', 'suggestions', 'improvements', 'Ralph', 'what', 'big', 'successful', 'companies', 'not', 'done', '9', '5', 'workers', 'old', 'army', 'buddy', 'Tom', 'Maria', 'boy', 'cowboy', 'show', 'television', 'children', '[', 'mentally', 'healthy', ']', 'Tom', 'Betsy', 'there', 'problem', 'honesty', 'Should', 'person', 'dine', 'when', 'emotional', 'Tom', 'family', 'first', 'place', 'company', 'decision', '[', 'What', 'would', 'do', ']', 'Tom', 'Betsy', 'arrange', 'payments', 'be', 'sent', 'Maria', 'so', 'film', 'happy', 'ending', '[', 'slow-moving', 'drama', 'concerned', 'psychology', 'characters', ']', 'film', 'view', 'life', '1950s', 'when', 'small', 'businesses', 'were', 'being', 'killed', 'off', 'benefit', 'large', 'corporations', 'wealthy', 'owners', 'Small', 'businesses', 'keep', 'wealth', 'locally', 'large', 'businesses', 'drain', 'wealth', 'away', 'New', 'York', 'other', 'financial', 'centers', 'Tom', 'decision', 'something', 'small', 'businesses', 'owner-operator', 'not', 'have', 'choose', 'family', 'business', 'are', 'same', 'wife', 'children', 'help', 'run', 'things', 'farm', 'family', 'business', 'Everyone', 'who', 'corporation', 'decide', 'family', 'business.Note', 'Tom', 'functions', 'personal', 'servant', 'owner', 'not', 'involved', 'advertising', 'sales', '[', 'Was', 'increase', 'mental', 'health', 'patients', 'result', 'big', 'corporations', 'killing', 'off', 'small', 'businesss', 'depression', '2008', 'have', 'similar', 'effects', ']']",The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit VHS
263315,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,6301720555,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[5, 7]","Everything about 20th Century-Fox's 1956 adaptation of Sloan Wilson's bestseller THE MAN IN THE GRAY FLANNEL SUIT screamed class.  The cast includes Jennifer Jones, Gregory Peck, Frederic March and Arthur O'Connell; Bernard Herrman did the music (and in its sonorities he was clearly working up to VERTIGO the following year); screenwriter Nunnally Johnson wrote the adaptation (after having done tons of them) and directed the movie (his first shot at that).  And of course, what would be a Fifties Fox film without that wide, wide CinemaScope and color by Deluxe?What emerges is something a little too solid and draggy for its own good.  Perhaps Wilson's source novel can be gently blamed, because it tends to raise issues and then chew them over, rationally and leisurely, only to be confronted later with more issues.  The main conflicts in Tom Rath's (Peck) life, are:  is he selling out to materialism (and his wife's eventual nagging) by taking a job for a broadcasting corporation at much more money than he earned at ""The Foundation""?  Once there, can he be his own man, especially carving out some family time instead of just working the executive treadmill?  And  (SPOILER) what is the honest thing to do upon finding out he sired an illegitimate child as a soldier in WWII Italy?The screenplay is quite faithful to the book, but level-headed discussions about suburbia, rich Dads who neglect their children, the cranky old man who took care of Grandmother, and so on, come across as static and stagy.  The World War II flashback sequences seemed to me much more elaborate than in the book, possibly because Fox wanted some male-action content to counteract what is, at heart, domestic melodrama.  Yet it was not all that entertaining.The cast helps redeem material that gave birth to a metaphor of corporate striving that still holds true after fifty years, and better yet, as a welcome relief to all the understatement, we do get to see some serious emoting from Jennifer Jones as she encourages, argues with, and at times battles her husband over the fate of their ""failure"" of a house.  Along with Frederic March as the overambitious Paley-esque head of a national broadcasting company come Lee J. Cobb as a sensible small-town lawyer, Arthur O'Connell as a glad-handing publicity exec, Keenan Wynn as Rath's WWII sergeant, and Connie Gilchrist who plays the maid most colorfully, as she did in GOOD NEWS and A LETTER TO THREE WIVES.  Excellent playing, all.Be warned that this flick runs two hours, 32 minutes.  But if you want to see a smooth production that is unfortunately light in dramatic content and character development, this would be a good chance.  If nothing else, you can learn why the ""Grey Flannel Suit"" metaphor galvanized an entire generation in its discontent.  But perhaps reading the book would be better yet.",4,"Not ""the greatest film ever,"" but interesting and good",1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,2845,"['Everything', '20th', 'Century-Fox', '1956', 'adaptation', 'Sloan', 'Wilson', 'bestseller', 'THE', 'MAN', 'IN', 'THE', 'GRAY', 'FLANNEL', 'SUIT', 'screamed', 'class', 'cast', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Frederic', 'March', 'Arthur', ""O'Connell"", 'Bernard', 'Herrman', 'did', 'music', 'sonorities', 'was', 'clearly', 'working', 'up', 'VERTIGO', 'following', 'year', 'screenwriter', 'Nunnally', 'Johnson', 'wrote', 'adaptation', 'having', 'done', 'tons', 'directed', 'movie', 'first', 'shot', 'course', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'Fifties', 'Fox', 'film', 'wide', 'wide', 'CinemaScope', 'color', 'Deluxe', 'What', 'something', 'little', 'too', 'solid', 'draggy', 'own', 'good', 'Perhaps', 'Wilson', 'source', 'novel', 'can', 'be', 'gently', 'blamed', 'raise', 'issues', 'then', 'chew', 'over', 'rationally', 'leisurely', 'only', 'be', 'confronted', 'later', 'more', 'issues', 'main', 'conflicts', 'Tom', 'Rath', 'Peck', 'life', 'are', 'selling', 'out', 'materialism', 'wife', 'eventual', 'nagging', 'taking', 'job', 'broadcasting', 'corporation', 'much', 'more', 'money', 'earned', 'Foundation', 'Once', 'there', 'can', 'be', 'own', 'man', 'especially', 'carving', 'out', 'family', 'time', 'instead', 'just', 'working', 'executive', 'treadmill', 'SPOILER', 'what', 'honest', 'thing', 'do', 'finding', 'out', 'sired', 'illegitimate', 'child', 'soldier', 'WWII', 'Italy', 'screenplay', 'quite', 'faithful', 'book', 'level-headed', 'discussions', 'suburbia', 'rich', 'Dads', 'who', 'neglect', 'children', 'cranky', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'took', 'care', 'Grandmother', 'so', 'come', 'static', 'stagy', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'seemed', 'much', 'more', 'elaborate', 'book', 'possibly', 'Fox', 'wanted', 'male-action', 'content', 'counteract', 'what', 'heart', 'domestic', 'melodrama', 'was', 'not', 'entertaining.The', 'cast', 'redeem', 'material', 'gave', 'birth', 'metaphor', 'corporate', 'striving', 'still', 'true', 'fifty', 'years', 'better', 'yet', 'welcome', 'relief', 'understatement', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'serious', 'emoting', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'times', 'battles', 'husband', 'fate', 'failure', 'house', 'Frederic', 'March', 'overambitious', 'Paley-esque', 'head', 'national', 'broadcasting', 'company', 'come', 'Lee', 'J.', 'Cobb', 'sensible', 'small-town', 'lawyer', 'Arthur', ""O'Connell"", 'glad-handing', 'publicity', 'exec', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', 'Rath', 'WWII', 'sergeant', 'Connie', 'Gilchrist', 'who', 'maid', 'most', 'colorfully', 'did', 'GOOD', 'NEWS', 'A', 'LETTER', 'TO', 'THREE', 'WIVES', 'Excellent', 'playing', 'all.Be', 'warned', 'flick', 'two', 'hours', '32', 'minutes', 'want', 'see', 'smooth', 'production', 'unfortunately', 'light', 'dramatic', 'content', 'character', 'development', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'chance', 'nothing', 'else', 'can', 'learn', 'why', 'Grey', 'Flannel', 'Suit', 'metaphor', 'galvanized', 'entire', 'generation', 'discontent', 'perhaps', 'reading', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'yet']",The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit VHS
263316,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301720555,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","My biggest issue with `The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit' is that the film itself seems to suffer from a serious identity crisis.  It doesn't know what story it wants to tell, and if it does it doesn't understand the best way to tell it.  The life of Tom Rath is an intriguing one, but the film's structure is a mess to be honest and it takes away from the impact one would expect to get from the film.  The flashbacks are too lengthy and distracting and the subplot involving Fredric March and his teenage daughter is unnecessary and time consuming.The film tells the story of a business man struggling to provide for his family.  He's haunted by his time overseas during the war and is harboring a deep secret from his wife, which threatens (in the film's final chapter) to expose itself.  In the meantime he's fighting for a new job (and bigger pay) and in the end fighting his moral conscience as he tries to win over his new boss.  A subplot concerning property and a disgruntled for employee of Rath's mother makes for a LOT of stuff going on in this ill formatted film.The lackluster performances don't really help much.  I've yet to be truly wowed by Gregory Peck.  I understand that he's beloved by many, but I find him sort of stiff.  Jennifer Jones opens and closes this film with her hideous facial expressions (DRAMA) and Arthur O'Connell clich&eacute;s up his every scene.  Fredric March is actually very good here, but he can't save the film when his subplot is one of the worst aspects of the script.The score from Herrmann is astonishingly good though, so there's a small plus in a sea of negatives.",2,Going everywhere and nowhere fast...,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,1615,"['biggest', 'issue', 'Man', 'Gray', 'Flannel', 'Suit', 'film', 'suffer', 'serious', 'identity', 'crisis', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'story', 'tell', ""n't"", 'understand', 'best', 'way', 'tell', 'life', 'Tom', 'Rath', 'intriguing', 'one', 'film', 'structure', 'mess', 'be', 'honest', 'away', 'impact', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'get', 'film', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'too', 'lengthy', 'distracting', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Fredric', 'March', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'unnecessary', 'time', 'consuming.The', 'film', 'story', 'business', 'man', 'struggling', 'provide', 'family', 'haunted', 'time', 'overseas', 'war', 'harboring', 'deep', 'secret', 'wife', 'film', 'final', 'chapter', 'expose', 'meantime', 'fighting', 'new', 'job', 'bigger', 'pay', 'end', 'fighting', 'moral', 'conscience', 'win', 'over', 'new', 'boss', 'subplot', 'concerning', 'property', 'disgruntled', 'employee', 'Rath', 'mother', 'LOT', 'stuff', 'going', 'ill', 'formatted', 'film.The', 'lackluster', 'performances', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'help', 'much', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'be', 'truly', 'wowed', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'understand', 'beloved', 'many', 'find', 'sort', 'stiff', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'opens', 'film', 'hideous', 'facial', 'expressions', 'DRAMA', 'Arthur', ""O'Connell"", 'clich', 'eacute', 'scene', 'Fredric', 'March', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'film', 'when', 'subplot', 'one', 'worst', 'aspects', 'script.The', 'score', 'Herrmann', 'astonishingly', 'good', 'small', 'plus', 'sea', 'negatives']",The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit VHS

263318,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6301720555,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","Gregory Peck seemed to get such thoughtful roles. This is one of his best. He plays Tom Rath, a WWII veteran who has been working for a non-profit foundation when he is recommended for a job as a PR man for a broadcasting company. The boss, Ralph Hopkins (Fredrick March) wants to start a big program to improve mental health care. As part of working on this project, Rath becomes involved in the melodrama that is the Hopkins family life.Through a series of flash backs, we learn a good bit about Rath's time in the Army, including a six-week period in Rome with a beautiful young woman. Yes, he was brave, and really a hero, but he also accidentally threw a grenade right in front of one of his men, and then carried the body to the nearest medic outpost, unwilling to believe he was dead. It's clear the war still has had an effect on his mind.His wife Betsy (Jennifer Jones) worries about what has changed him, but of course he has told her very little. They have three children and live in a house she absolutely hates at the time he gets his new job. But his grandmother has recently died and left him her white elephant of a house, so they go to live there. There are sub-plots about that which have the benefit of introducing us to Judge Bernstein (Lee J. Cobb), a crusty old gent with a very practical turn of mind about the law.Much of the story centers around honesty, the keeping of secrets, and the habit of yes men to try to tell the boss what they think he wants to hear rather than the honest evaluation for which they are paid. Rath may have to be prodded into being honest with the boss by his wife, but when it comes time for him to be honest with her, she freaks out. Fortunately, she gets over her freak out and her practical side asserts itself in the end.It's an excellent movie with many subtleties, several intriguing sub-plots that help to convey the inner life of the main characters, and very much what a Gregory Peck movie is supposed to be.",5,"A Classic Title, But Do You Know the Story?",1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,1970,"['Gregory', 'Peck', 'seemed', 'get', 'such', 'thoughtful', 'roles', 'one', 'best', 'Tom', 'Rath', 'WWII', 'veteran', 'who', 'been', 'working', 'non-profit', 'foundation', 'when', 'recommended', 'job', 'PR', 'man', 'broadcasting', 'company', 'boss', 'Ralph', 'Hopkins', 'Fredrick', 'March', 'start', 'big', 'program', 'improve', 'mental', 'health', 'care', 'part', 'working', 'project', 'Rath', 'involved', 'melodrama', 'Hopkins', 'family', 'series', 'flash', 'backs', 'learn', 'good', 'bit', 'Rath', 'time', 'Army', 'including', 'six-week', 'period', 'Rome', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'Yes', 'was', 'brave', 'really', 'hero', 'also', 'accidentally', 'threw', 'grenade', 'right', 'front', 'one', 'men', 'then', 'carried', 'body', 'nearest', 'medic', 'outpost', 'unwilling', 'believe', 'was', 'dead', 'clear', 'war', 'still', 'had', 'effect', 'mind.His', 'wife', 'Betsy', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'what', 'changed', 'course', 'told', 'very', 'little', 'have', 'three', 'children', 'live', 'house', 'absolutely', 'time', 'new', 'job', 'grandmother', 'recently', 'died', 'left', 'white', 'elephant', 'house', 'go', 'live', 'there', 'are', 'sub-plots', 'have', 'benefit', 'introducing', 'Judge', 'Bernstein', 'Lee', 'J.', 'Cobb', 'crusty', 'old', 'gent', 'very', 'practical', 'turn', 'mind', 'law.Much', 'story', 'centers', 'honesty', 'keeping', 'secrets', 'habit', 'yes', 'men', 'try', 'tell', 'boss', 'what', 'think', 'hear', 'rather', 'honest', 'evaluation', 'are', 'paid', 'Rath', 'may', 'have', 'be', 'prodded', 'being', 'honest', 'boss', 'wife', 'when', 'time', 'be', 'honest', 'out', 'Fortunately', 'freak', 'practical', 'side', 'end.It', 'excellent', 'movie', 'many', 'subtleties', 'several', 'intriguing', 'sub-plots', 'help', 'convey', 'inner', 'life', 'main', 'characters', 'very', 'much', 'what', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be']",The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit VHS

Some fifty years later, this movie still holds a powerful lesson about the balance of work commitments and family duty.In post-war New York, working-class family man Tom Rath (Gregory Peck) tries to provide as much as he can for his young family, despite the limitations of his income.  Tom's wife Betsy (Jennifer Jones), always trying to find new ways to make money, suggests they move from their Connecticut house into Tom's dead grandmother's mansion--an idea that later backfires when it's discovered that the mansion has been willed away from the Rath family.  Tom's life is complicated still by his recurring flashbacks about the War, and the young girl he left behind (Marisa Pavan).  Tom's boss, Ralph Hopkins (Fredric March) ended up destroying his own family for the very same values and ambitions that Tom is now striving for...can he help Tom avoid the same fate?It's such a treat seeing Gregory Peck and Jennifer Jones, the violent young lovers of ""Duel in the Sun"", teamed again in this outstanding family drama.  Their chemistry was outstanding.  In the character of Tom Rath, Peck managed to convey all the frustrations, fears and aspirations of the average working man.  Jennifer Jones compliments him well as Tom's wife. Fredric March adds lots of gravity and wisdom to his role of Tom's mentor, Ralph.THE MAN IN THE GRAY FLANNEL SUIT was truly producer Darryl Zanuck's prestige picture for 1956.  Though at times the lush CinemaScope visuals clash with the intimate nature of the story, the production values are high and the entire film is a treat to behold.

Mathieu ""waldenpond88""","[0, 1]","After having read all other reviews and just watching this wonderful movie again, I want to write about my opinion on this film.First of all why is the length of the movie such a big deal? I just don't get it. Movies from the nineties and after are usually at least 135 minutes long, so 153 minutes is only 18 minutes longer. Not much of a difference.Then there is the great soundtrack by Bernard Herrmann who made the score for 8 Hitchcock movies and for ""Cape Fear"".I also believe that Tom Rath is not only haunted by his war time memories, but that he sometimes thinks that Maria, his love in Italy, probably would have made a better wife, because she was giving and caring, but Tom's wife Betsy is not giving at all and expects too much from Tom (instead of getting a job and contribute to their life style of which she is so unsatisfied).This is an excellent film from the fifties, at least as good (if not better) as ""Strangers when we met"", ""Peyton Place"", ""A Summer Place"", ""All that Heaven allows"", ""Susan Slade"" and ""Imitation of Life"".Watch the film first, then read the book by Sloan Wilson (who also wrote ""A Summer Place"", another wonderful novel). You won't be disappointed.Gregory Peck made some unforgettable movies like ""To kill a mockingbird"", ""Roman Holiday"", ""Twelve O'Clock High"", ""Gentleman's Agreement"", ""Cape Fear"", ""Mirage"" (finally available on DVD) and ""The Bravados"" (his best western), but ""The Man in the gray Flannel Suit"" will always be my # 1 Gregory Peck movie.",5,Gregory Peck's best Movie,1306022400,"05 22, 2011",2011,1496,"['having', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'just', 'watching', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'again', 'want', 'write', 'opinion', 'film.First', 'why', 'length', 'movie', 'big', 'deal', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Movies', 'nineties', 'are', 'usually', 'least', '135', 'minutes', 'long', 'so', '153', 'minutes', 'only', '18', 'minutes', 'longer', 'Not', 'much', 'difference.Then', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'who', 'made', 'score', '8', 'Hitchcock', 'movies', 'Cape', 'Fear', '.I', 'also', 'believe', 'Tom', 'Rath', 'not', 'only', 'haunted', 'war', 'time', 'memories', 'Maria', 'love', 'Italy', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'wife', 'was', 'giving', 'caring', 'Tom', 'wife', 'Betsy', 'not', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'Tom', 'instead', 'getting', 'job', 'contribute', 'life', 'style', 'so', 'unsatisfied', '.This', 'excellent', 'film', 'fifties', 'least', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'Strangers', 'when', 'met', 'Peyton', 'Place', 'Summer', 'Place', 'Heaven', 'Susan', 'Slade', 'Imitation', 'Life', '.Watch', 'film', 'first', 'then', 'read', 'book', 'Sloan', 'Wilson', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'A', 'Summer', 'Place', 'wonderful', 'novel', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.Gregory', 'Peck', 'made', 'unforgettable', 'movies', 'kill', 'mockingbird', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'Twelve', ""O'Clock"", 'High', 'Gentleman', 'Agreement', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'Mirage', 'finally', 'available', 'DVD', 'Bravados', 'best', 'western', 'Man', 'gray', 'Flannel', 'Suit', 'will', 'always', 'be', '1', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'movie']",The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit VHS
263327,A315K47GRB024C,6301720555,Daniel C. Markel,"[7, 7]","This review is for the 2005 Twentieth Century Fox DVD.The movie is set in the mid-1950's where Gregory Peck stars as Tom Rath, a former World War II army captain, who now has a white-collar job in New York and has three kids, a home in a small town, with a caring, but socially ambitious wife.  Like all family men, Tom is pursuing ""the American dream"" but the reality is that there are plenty of obstacles.  Overall, the home life seems good, but in spite of having a pretty good job, a better one would solve a lot of financial issues on the home front.  Tom eventually takes on a new job working on Madison Ave.  His boss is an extremely successful businessman, but his home life is in shambles.  Tom has to walk a fine line between appeasing his new boss who seems lost in a new project and being a productive worker who gets results.  Also, something from Tom's past turns up unexpectedly and that's another issue that he has to deal with.  This sets up the rest of the movie with many issues for Tom and the people in his life to deal with.`The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit' is a hard hitting commentary of life in the 1950's that historically seemed like an age of wholesomeness, prosperity and social bliss.  In an era of ""Father Knows Best"" and ""Ozzie & Harriet"" where the only problems in the world seemed to be nave kids getting into harmless trouble, but without exception, always received brilliant guidance with the wisdom and understanding of the seemingly perfect parents.  But in addition to a thorough examination of middle class life in the 1950's, a significant portion of this movie focuses on an army captain's social and combat life in World War II.  Unlike a typical WWII film where the good guys win, the bad guys lose, and main character is a hero, this film ventures in a completely different direction and deals with the consequences of a soldier's indiscriminant actions plus acknowledges the disturbing mental anxiety that person carries with him due to action in combat. In short, this film shows a dark side to all the pretentiousness of 1950's life in America.  Even though it's over 2-1/2 hours long, it's an excellent movie that pushes a lot of buttons and with plenty of realistic social commentary without being exploitive or preachy.As for the DVD, the color widescreen presentation is superb.  The colors are bright and vivid with no signs of deterioration or stray artifacts. The DVD bonuses include commentary by author and publisher James Monaco, plus some minor features such as a trailer and some still photos.Movie: A-DVD Quality: A+",5,A seemingly realistic movie that wrestles with plenty of tough issues rarely dealt with in 1950's films.,1128902400,"10 10, 2005",2005,2578,"['review', '2005', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', 'DVD.The', 'movie', 'set', 'mid-1950', 'where', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Tom', 'Rath', 'former', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'army', 'captain', 'who', 'now', 'white-collar', 'job', 'New', 'York', 'three', 'kids', 'home', 'small', 'town', 'caring', 'socially', 'ambitious', 'wife', 'family', 'men', 'Tom', 'pursuing', 'American', 'dream', 'reality', 'are', 'plenty', 'obstacles', 'Overall', 'home', 'life', 'good', 'spite', 'having', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'better', 'one', 'would', 'solve', 'lot', 'financial', 'issues', 'home', 'front', 'Tom', 'eventually', 'new', 'job', 'working', 'Madison', 'Ave.', 'boss', 'extremely', 'successful', 'businessman', 'home', 'life', 'shambles', 'Tom', 'walk', 'fine', 'line', 'appeasing', 'new', 'boss', 'who', 'lost', 'new', 'project', 'being', 'productive', 'worker', 'who', 'results', 'Also', 'something', 'Tom', 'past', 'up', 'unexpectedly', 'issue', 'deal', 'up', 'rest', 'movie', 'many', 'issues', 'Tom', 'people', 'life', 'deal', 'with.', 'Man', 'Gray', 'Flannel', 'Suit', 'hard', 'hitting', 'commentary', 'life', '1950', 'historically', 'seemed', 'age', 'wholesomeness', 'prosperity', 'social', 'bliss', 'era', 'Father', 'Knows', 'Best', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'where', 'only', 'problems', 'world', 'seemed', 'be', 'nave', 'kids', 'getting', 'harmless', 'trouble', 'exception', 'always', 'received', 'brilliant', 'guidance', 'wisdom', 'understanding', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'parents', 'addition', 'thorough', 'examination', 'middle', 'class', 'life', '1950', 'significant', 'portion', 'movie', 'army', 'captain', 'social', 'combat', 'life', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'typical', 'WWII', 'film', 'where', 'good', 'guys', 'win', 'bad', 'guys', 'lose', 'main', 'character', 'hero', 'film', 'ventures', 'completely', 'different', 'direction', 'deals', 'consequences', 'soldier', 'indiscriminant', 'actions', 'disturbing', 'mental', 'anxiety', 'person', 'due', 'action', 'combat', 'short', 'film', 'dark', 'side', 'pretentiousness', '1950', 'life', 'America', 'Even', '2-1/2', 'hours', 'long', 'excellent', 'movie', 'lot', 'buttons', 'plenty', 'realistic', 'social', 'commentary', 'being', 'exploitive', 'preachy.As', 'DVD', 'color', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'superb', 'colors', 'are', 'bright', 'vivid', 'signs', 'deterioration', 'stray', 'artifacts', 'DVD', 'bonuses', 'include', 'commentary', 'author', 'publisher', 'James', 'Monaco', 'minor', 'features', 'such', 'trailer', 'still', 'photos.Movie', 'A-DVD', 'Quality', 'A+']",The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit VHS

I saw this movie as a kid and it always struck home with me with him being the dedicated, but confused, husband of Jennifer Jones. They make a good pair like they did in Duel in the Sun. For a man known for action films like The Guns of Navarone, this movie demonstrates how Gregory Peck can play just about anything.His role is a businessman complacently working in a small firm in New York. He earns $7,000 a year at a time when that was considered good money, but not enough to grow on. Through a recommendation from a friend on the train, he accepts an interview for an AD agency with the potential of earning more money. His wife, played by Jennifer Jones (herself a great actress), pushes Greg Peck to earn more money so they can move to a better neighborhood. Despite having two children, a beautiful home, and a stable income, they are not happy. She tells him, ""I can't stand living in this home!"" I'm left to wonder why considering how nice it is. Greg's character is plagued with memories of his experiences in WWII. In Italy he had an affair with a local woman. In the Pacific he loses his close friend in combat. Both have extreme influences on his character as he tries to understand how to keep his family happy and together.At the same time, his work in the AD agency is taking off. The president likes Greg, and we see hints how Greg may remind the president of the agency, played by the great Fredric March. We also learn about other characters in the film that play a significant role in the film. Fredric March is clearly the successful AD-man and head of a powerful agency. But his personal life is a wreck. His wife kicked him out of their home long ago, and their daughter refuses to go to college and is planning on marrying a much older man as a way of getting away from them both. It is heart-wrenching when we see Fredric March try and reason with his daughter and wife. He even explodes on Greg's character about what he sacrificed to get where he is.In the end, Greg Peck must choose between his family and work-life.

Should we always tell our employer the brutal truth?  Are we obligated to commit economic suicide?  Alas, we all must compromise in the real world.  The only real question is how far can we go before betraying our ultimate values. Tom Rath (Gregory Peck) is a WWII veteran trying to make it in the Big Apple.  Should he dedicate his whole heart and soul to the company?  Is there any room for Rath's family?  Where must he draw the line?  The only serious negative is that women are treated as stay-at-home moms.  Still, this is a well done movie and worthy of your time and interest.This movie will almost certainly resonate with those viewing it even in the distant future.  Its central themes are eternally relevant.  However, there is one scene that reminded me that The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit is a fictional account of the mid 1950s.  Tom Rath is informed by his wife that they must purchase a new washing machine.  It will cost $250.00.  Please note that this is an era when a $10,000 income was considered to be far above average.

263332,AZUBX0AYYNTFF,6301720555,Donald M. Bishop,"[0, 0]","Growing up in one of New York's commuter suburbs in the 1950s, I often heard the phrase, ""gray flannel suit,"" from the title of the novel by Sloan Wilson and this film.  The phrase was shorthand for conformity, consumerism, and the deadening qualities of the corporate rat race.Peck gives a good performance as a young executive in public relations.  Fredric March's portrayal of a broadcasting CEO is particularly fine.  Jennifer Jones plays some overwrought scenes.The movie also offers a window on some things past:  the New Haven Railroad, early television, World War II PTSD, judges who cared for character and honor, and indeed, gray flannel suits.  They dressed handsomely on Madison Avenue.  On the other hand, one wonders what the interior decorators of the time were smoking.  This is the decade when Betty Freidan was doing a slow burn on the discontents of suburban women, and it strikes me there could be feminist readings of the film that support her view of the decade.When I watched the film recently, I thought it might sermonize on conformity and consumerism.  I found, however, that the movie is driven more by its subplots -- psychological aftereffects of the war, a wife's ambition for her husband, and corporate politics.  The larger themes don't reach out and punch you.  Rather they are implicit.Yes, the film takes you back to the 1950s, but after you've watched it, think it over.  More than half a century has passed since the film was made, and America is a different place.

His wife, Jennifer Jones, is pushing him to make more money and to be more successful, but without losing his ideals or honesty in a business that values neither one of those.  His experiences in World War II are coming back to haunt him, and his ownership of his grandmother's house is being challenged by her former servant.  Fredric March co-stars as his new boss, a man who put his business before his family, a decision whose consequences he must now live with.  There are a lot of lofty ideas being bounced around in this story, and they tend to center around the importance of family and being true to one's self and ideals.  Peck is his usual solid self, probably the perfect choice for this kind of role.  Jones gets the big emotional scene in the film, and she plays it to the hilt.  March gives a very moving, sympathetic performance, while Ann Harding as his distant wife has a couple of good scenes.

Menta, Jr.","[5, 5]","Lushly photographed and intelligently scripted, ""The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit"" is an engaging and often bracing look at one man trying to make it in the world, both on a personal and professional level.  As pointed out by one or two other reviews on this site, the issues faced by Gregory Peck's character aren't too different than those faced by any working man or woman today.The one difference is that Mr. Peck's character is still very much affected by the ominous looming in the recent past of the most dramatic event of the twentieth century up to that point, World War II.  He at one point asks himself how it's possible for a man to see and take part in all manner of horrendous activities during that war and then go back to quietly taking the train to work while reading the morning paper.  That line of thinking still resonates today, and it certainly adds a layer of complexity to a movie that's already interesting just dealing with the handful of relatively minor domestic and business issues that form its centerpiece.To quibble a bit, the movie takes a little more time than it really needs to cover its subject matter, but on DVD that isn't much of a problem.  Just take a short break here and there and you'll do just fine.  The movie isn't an ordeal at all to get through.  Just sit back and enjoy the classy script, acting, and direction, and the excellent widescreen image, which was recently restored.But before I conclude, let me throw out a quick question to all you amateur psychologists and armchair critics out there:  how come in every scene involving the children playing together or talking to their parents, the otherwise cheerful kids bring up the subject of dying, death, and/or getting killed?  It's not just one or two times, but every time there's an extended scene with the kids.  I found that interesting, so I just thought I'd put the question out there.

263342,A6ADO7B6FUVN,6301720555,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[6, 7]","On the surface, The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit offers a captivating drama where a man struggles with his memories from World War II while trying to be a strong father at home.  Yet, the film submerges into a much deeper dissection of the American society, which offers amusement, drama, and contemplation.  Much of the film is obviously shot in a studio, however, this seems like a minute detail when the story begins to take form.Hard work, dedication, and courage are the corner stones of the American Dream, which should help people build a prosperous future.  In the backdrop of the American Dream, people of the 1950s also strived to achieve the perfect family through a number of intriguing methods.  Many moved out of the cities into the suburbs where they sought a relatively easy life style without much hassle and stress.  This notion was superficially padded with a perfect little house with a nice car and all the amenities that comfort requires.  In order to gain these items, many had to work harder and sacrifice more of their personal life in order to make the monthly installments.  In addition, many had to use the public transit system to and from work while time with the family continued to decrease.  Nunnally Johnson uses the same name as Sloan Wilson's novel The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit to illustrate his vision of the American Dream.After the soothing music during opening credits the audience is thrown into the hectic and stressful life of New York City shortly after 5:00pm on a weekday.  People are venturing home on a train after a long and rewarding day of hard work.  Among the passengers, the main character Tom Rath (Gregory Peck) sits down at his usual seat together with Bill Hawthorn (Gene Lockhart) who asks him how his wife is doing.  It leads into a discussion where Tom's explains his financial predicament of not making ends meet.  Bill informs him about an opening at USB (no, not the computer port).  However, Tom who has become settled in his position in life is first hesitant while using his complacent persona to avoid unnecessary risks by starting a new career.Throughout the film, the audience is introduced to Tom's children, his wife, his work, and his boss while also being able to see into his past through extensive flashbacks.  Through these parts of Tom's life a colorful illustration of how his persona was shaped emerges, as the film displays numerous situations in his life.  It is evident that Tom is a righteous and dedicated person who has shown much courage and hard work throughout his life.  However, some incidents in his life caused him to create a complacent attitude towards life, as he no longer has any aspirations for prosperity.  This is one of the things that bothers his wife, Betsy Rath (Jennifer Jones), who desires a better home and a more stable economy that does not trigger any financial stress on their lives.  It leads Tom to seek the open position at television network USB.The film goes into great depth to suggest how the quest for the American Dream sometimes can change people, as opportunities of short cuts to success and prosperity materialize.  Through Tom's job, the audience can witness how he deals with situations in the corporate world, where he faces the corporate politics.  He must make decisions whether to corrupt his character in order to secure his future, or take the risk of loosing it all through honesty.  It is fascinating to see how it can be harmful to achieve the American Dream, as it hurts the society, the family, and the individual.  The hurtful aspects of the American Dream also emerge through Tom's boss, Ralph Hopkins (Fredric March) who gained great success and vast prosperity through ceaseless dedication to his job, but never obtained the perfect family.The brilliant performance by Gregory Peck helps develop an intriguing persona, which is honorable and devoted.  Yet, he is not perfect, which brings to mind the notion of human imperfection.  Johnson goes even further than the American Dream with this film, as his film deals with both aspects of life - joy and pain.  It is through these two opposite facets of life where Johnson reveals the idea that the American Dream is merely a mirage of perfection, as life cannot be without misery.  Nonetheless, people continue to hunt for the American Dream, the illusion of no suffering, but as Johnson proposes these people loose themselves in the illusion of happiness where bad things rests.It is within the story the audience will find a meaningful tale, which has something for every viewer to ponder from any part of society.  This is due to Johnson's cinematic treatment of a social issue through an interesting philosophical approach, as he presents several different viewpoints on the issue.

Profound?  You said it.  Peck is miscast here, as he always is when asked to play a man with an emotion that requires more than a raised eyebrow and a lowering of the voice.  Frederic March is impeccable as always as the boss who has become boss by sacrificing everything and everyone on the altar of his ambition, but yet retains a heart of gold.  Jennifer Jones has a thankless role as the ever-nagging wife - hers is the only character with any dimension at all - the rest are strictly one-dimensional cardboard cut-outs.  I was waiting for the scene in which Peck's character begins wearing the halo he has spent his life earning - he is the epitome of the suffering saint - most saints of course were once human and so exhibited (one would presume) emotions - emotions which Peck has too fine a mind to allow to enter his cranium.  No cliche goes unturned here.  The disaffected wife, the rebellious daughter, the always lovable children (so loveable and well-behaved that one forgets they are there from time to time), the underhanded and envious supervisor.  The wife is at first understandably upset at learning her husband betrayed her with another woman, but after a few minutes of soul searching she accepts it.  She accepts it because she, like the audience, knows that Peck is a well-intentioned monolith of morality who merely made an unfortunate misstep which keeps him earthbound with the rest of us.

It compares favorably with the movies of Douglas Sirk in the manner that it exposes the shaky underpinnings of the decade characterized by the ""green fairways of indifference.""Gregory Peck's ""Tom Rath"" is haunted by the horrors he experienced in WWII, as well as a passionate affair with an Italian girl whom he knew he left pregnant with his child.  He has returned to the US, married his sweetheart Betsy (Jennifer Jones), and is doggedly pursuing the American dream while trying to keep his integrity intact.  His wife is more materialistic than he is; his kids are mesmerized by shoot-'em-up Westerns on TV.When he pursues a better job with a large corporation, he finds favor with an executive whom he reminds of a lost son.  He begins work on designing a campaign for his boss regarding mental health initiatives, and is encounters obstacles in the form of office politics.  At every step of the way in his attempts to better his life, he is beset by difficult ethical questions and determined adversaries.  The subtleness of the movie comes in the awareness of how thin of a blade his chances of happiness rest upon.  The executive/father figure (played byFredric March)  is also plagued by personal problems, including a threatening heart condition.  Should he die, Tom Rath would lose his most crucial supporter.The one minor detraction to this otherwise fine movie is that as ""Tom Rath's"" marital problems finally begin to heal, the movie abruptly ends and leaves the other issues hanging unresolved.Nevertheless this is a satisfying portrayal of the difficulties of living a moral life, with good performances all around.

263353,A39IY0JU5JI69G,6301720555,"Promise ""promise""","[1, 1]","I had heard about this film for years but never saw it.  It is very much of its time--the 50's--post WWII when Americans were settling into prosperity.  I had assumed that this would be about some man's climb upward in an ad agency or something.  It is so much more than that.  And although it describes perfectly the dilemmas of the time, the basic human elements are told so well that people today can surely relate to the film.Gregory Peck is his usual magnificent self.  He is almost too handsome for the role but it helps to have someone so beautiful to watch for such a long film.  Besides his looks and natural elegance, he reeks of character and integrity, which make us pull for him through the long haul.  His ""lapse"" of marital fidelity is certainly shown in the most sympathetic way.Jennifer Jones, as his wife, was a little disappointing to me.  It is mentioned elsewhere that she was nicer in the book.  She is a complex character here in the film, who, at times seems selfish, shallow and materialistic, while, at other times, berates her husband for not having enough courage to tell the blunt truth to his boss (and thereby risk the steady income which she so desperately is counting on). I didn't find her particularly beautiful here, either, although she has been stunning in many of her other roles. In sum, she isn't as sympathetic a character as Peck's but perhaps she is that much more human.  The 50's were a time of people wanting to forget the horrors and hardships of the war, rationing, and death and fell in love with refrigerators, cars, tvs and all the good things that money could buy.The script is intelligent and both sides of many issues are thoroughly played out.  This may seem maddening and slow to some viewers who are used to faster action films withless dialogue, but I found it satisfying.  In many of the scenes, such as the one where Peck discloses the fact of his war time affair to his wife, I could agree with each one of them, in turn.It is heartening to see a film tackle such moral issues and to show the difficulty most people face when trying to live a decent life.I enjoyed the costumes and especially the decor.  So many film sets from the 50's show the tackier elements of the style of that era  but some of these places---the offices and the Connecticut home of the boss's ex-wife were quite beautiful.The subplots of the boss' family problems and the problems with the inherited house were all interesting.  The scenes in Italy were touching and charming.

263354,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6301720555,Randy Keehn,"[1, 4]","For some reason, I didn't think I'd seen ""The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit"" before when I watched it last night.  However, I readily remembered a number of scenes I seen many years ago.  Most of the scenes were odd ones involving what I considered to be strange behavior or dialogue.  The first one that comes up is the ""biography"" that the Gregory Peck character has to write for his executive job interview.  He gets an hour by himself to write about himself and how he'll be an asset to the National Broadcasting Association (or whatever it's called).  Off by himself, he is focussed on a difficult WWII flashback and comes up with three or four sentences that says, essentionally, ""What a dumb idea; just hire me"".  I thought it was extremely lame but the head honcho, played rather absent-mindedly by Fredrick March, thought it was outstandingly original.  Thus begins an akward job that doesn't seem to involve anything other than writing a speech for a medical convention.  The whole executive staff seems to be involved with ""The Speech"".  Peck's offering gets tossed which is what should have happened with his ""biography"" instead.  Meanwhile, March has a confusing scene with his ex-wife about their 18 year old daughter in which the ex asks March to try and straighten her out.  She says that if he doesn't at least try to do this, she'll never speak to him again.  People are saying absolutes and accussations left and right in this movie.  There is a lot of personal issues that come up but we never get to hear ""The Speech"". Maybe that's just as well; with so many contributors, it was probably a cure for insomnia.  There's an excellent part played by Lee J. Cobb who, with Gregory Peck's performance, nearly saves the film.  The ending is strong or else I would only have given this movie ""3 Stars"".I mentioned having seen the movie before because those same scenes I mentioned had been in the back of my mind all these years (I just had it mixed up as to which Gregory Peck movie they were from).  I guess it says a lot when so many scenes (and there were others as well) stay with you for so long.  Maybe I was just confused by how such seemingly important people spent so much time doing nothing.  This is a movie about business vs. family and the choices those seeking success need to make.  It attempts to portray the pros and cons of both choices (office politics vs. unattentive children, for example) yet the way so many people over-react to the situations that come up alienated me from giving the movie's message more serious attention.  Maybe you'll have better luck with it.

This is Peck's performance in The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit and he is brilliant. Several reviewers have noted ""the Look"" of the film and its quintessential Fifties style. This is true, I felt I was gaining a peak at a long lost world: Post-war America, advancing economically, but struggling morally. The flashbacks make this half a War movie and give it a shared history with its adult intended audience. This was a time when adult movies did not mean pornography, but dealt with mature themes such as honesty in relationships and integrity in your profession.Gregory Peck has some great scenes, many in which he doesn't seem to do much. The look on his face on the train when the man in the coat in front of him triggers a repulsive memory from the war is worth pages of dialogue. The uncomprehending shock from when he accidentally kills his best friend is a real tearjerker. I don't know what other American actor at this time could be so effective.The plot was a surprise to me, I really had no idea this was such an engaging story. The title implies a dull, plodding story, and I have to admit little prior knowledge about this movie except its one of those I'd always heard about. This has got to be one of the best movies out of the Fifties and that is saying a lot. There is poignancy, humor (the kids always glued to the TV and oblivious to the real drama around them), and above all, a slice of life that is absorbing and realistic. This is definitely an overlooked gem needing full DVD glory.

263357,AT07UZQQR7ZEH,6301720555,"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[10, 10]","THE MAN IN THE GRAY FLANNEL SUIT (1956) is writer/director Nunnally Johnson's ambitious film version of the popular 1953 best-seller by Sloan Wilson.  It is set in suburban Connecticut and Rockefeller Center, linked by trains full of commuters.  One of those commuters is Gregory Peck, who does advertising for one of the big television networks run by his boss, Fredric March.  Johnson is setting up contrasts here.  Peck is married to Jennifer Jones and has three kids; March is married to 1930's actress Ann Harding and has a daughter named Susie.  Both March and Jones seem unhappy at home, happier at work.  But Peck is haunted by his past, in the Army in the Pacific in 1945 after World War Two is over in Europe.  Peck has an affair with lovely Marisa Pavan, who gives birth to his child.  What Peck will do with that Italian child covers the last half hour of the movie.I like the film a lot because it gives us the clothes and cars and job world of my early childhood in the suburbia of 1950's San Francisco.  And the cast is incredible, including Lee J. Cobb, Henry Daniell, Arthur O'Connell, Gene Lockhart, and Keenan Wynn.  The brilliant use of CinemaScope, almost all in long shot with characters standing or sitting at opposite ends of the wide screen, is by Charles G. Clarke.  A magnificently knowledgeable audio commentary has film scholar James Monaco comparing movie and book constantly, often talking about his own life during this early 1950's period, the cars his father owned and the hats worn, and the stunning use of CinemaScope for a movie that simply could not withstand pan and scan treatment.  Maybe that is why it is not shown that often on TV, wonders Monaco; the only network that would always run it letterboxed, Turner Classics, does not own this Fox movie.  Thank God for DVD.THE MAN IN THE GRAY FLANNEL SUIT runs a long 153 minutes, but maintains interest throughout and was a pet project of producer Darryl F. Zanuck.  This is from an era when a high-powered Production Chief could dictate that a movie run long to do justice to a long novel.  Monaco keeps saying that Jones' wife character is much nicer in the book and does not harp all the time on the quality of life she and Peck have in Connecticut.  She seems only a bit too unpleasant on screen for me, and the house they move out of is quite beautiful to me also.  That is a director's choice-or maybe Zanuck's choice.  Monaco also mentions the kids watching TV a lot in a darkened living room as not being in the book.  This is contrasted against a television network office at Rockefeller Center that only has two TV monitors and not the logical three, something I never would have picked up on, like a man wearing the wrong hat or driving the wrong year model car.  It is a very illuminating audio commentary by a movie lover and knowledgeable reader for a very good movie.

That's unfortunate, because its central issue -- should one be honest, or ""play by the rules"" to keep your job? -- remains pertinent.The problems must be laid at the feet of Nunnally Johnson, who wrote, directed, and produced. There's a lot of pretentious, wordy dialog. (It's embarrassing to see a fine actor like Fredric March given such a poorly written role.) Most scenes lack momentum. Attempts at humor largely fizzle. The acting never rises above ""acceptable"", with Ann Harding as March's wife particularly bad.The main problem, though, is that Johnson fails to energetically dramatize the story's conflicts -- in particular, Tom's eventual decision to tell March what he really thinks about the latter's plan to start a national crusade for mental-health awareness. The story and the characters just sort of lie there, without doing much to engage our interest. The sequence in which Peck accidentally kills his best friend and tries to get medical help for the corpse is particularly weak. (We do, however, get to see DeForest Kelley inform Peck that the man is dead.)The film's perceived weakness might actually be the result of the way its observations about the soullessness of business have become part of the common social vocabulary. But I don't think so. It is a thoroughly mediocre film.Bernard Herrmann's score is one of his lesser efforts -- though Fox does him the honor (as it did in ""The Ghost and Mrs Muir"") of letting his title music replace the Fox fanfare. There are some excellent sequences -- particularly the one in which Peck and two other soldiers kill Germans to get their warm clothing -- but the music ultimately demonstrates just how difficult it is to write a distinctive score for a conventional, contemporary drama. (I am of the opinion that serious dramas should have little or no scoring.)The transfer is excellent. The sound (both music and dialog) appears to be real stereo, typical of Fox's early CinemaScope films.
