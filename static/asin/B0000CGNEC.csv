This show is brillant, mainly because it doesn't try to hard to make you laugh.  From a guys view, most of the stuff that Doug does in the show, I have personally done at one time or another.  Arthur (Jerry Stiller) is absolutly hilarious as Carrie's (Leah Remini) father.  Everybody has met an old person like Arthur before.  Oh yeah, speaking of Leah Remini, she is so damn hot and funny. She is the kind of girl that I would want to marry.  A girl who can be a really big pain, but at the same time is very, very sexy.The best moments of the show are when Doug and Arthur are arguing with eachother.  i.e. Doug bought cereal that had 3-D glasses in them.  Arthur got the 3-D glasses but didn't have the box that was in 3-D.  Doug had it.  So they tried to compromise taking turns, but they ended up fighting over them and breaking the glasses and the cereal box.If you like good humor, that at times gets ""adult"" (well, at least for network television) then check out The King Of Queens.",5,The King Of All Kings,1080172800,"03 25, 2004",2004,1128,"['Right', 'Now', 'King', 'Queens', 'best', 'comedy', 'sitcom', 'NETWORK', 'television', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'funniest', 'show', 'television', 'show', 'brillant', 'mainly', ""n't"", 'try', 'hard', 'make', 'laugh', 'guys', 'view', 'most', 'stuff', 'Doug', 'show', 'have', 'personally', 'done', 'one', 'time', 'Arthur', 'Jerry', 'Stiller', 'absolutly', 'hilarious', 'Carrie', 'Leah', 'Remini', 'father', 'Everybody', 'met', 'old', 'person', 'Arthur', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'speaking', 'Leah', 'Remini', 'so', 'damn', 'hot', 'funny', 'kind', 'girl', 'would', 'want', 'marry', 'A', 'girl', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'big', 'pain', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'very', 'sexy.The', 'best', 'moments', 'show', 'are', 'when', 'Doug', 'Arthur', 'are', 'arguing', 'eachother', 'i.e', 'Doug', 'bought', 'cereal', 'had', '3-D', 'glasses', 'Arthur', 'got', '3-D', 'glasses', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'box', 'was', '3-D.', 'Doug', 'had', 'tried', 'compromise', 'taking', 'turns', 'ended', 'up', 'fighting', 'breaking', 'glasses', 'cereal', 'like', 'good', 'humor', 'times', 'adult', 'well', 'least', 'network', 'television', 'then', 'check', 'out', 'King', 'Queens']",The King of Queens: Season 1

776421,A3MD3EWWMZPRVO,B0000CGNEC,D. Mart,"[21, 25]","THE KING OF QUEENS is one of the funniest shows on television.  It is also the most under-rated.  Granted:  the first few episodes are not very good, but the show quickly picks up later on in the season.KING OF QUEENS has been compared by some to THE HONEYMOONERS.  While this show is a lot better, in my opinion, I can definately see the similarities:  the humor is often executed in the same fashion; and Kerry's dad (Jerry Stiller) is kind of like a re-incarnated version of Art Carney :).The show may not be everyone's cup of tea.  But the reason I like it so much is simply because, unlike most other sitcoms, it's well-written, well-acted (Kevin James is a very under-estimated comedic actor), and it doesn't ever try to be more than it is.  So many other comedies seem to stretch for laughs (Whoopi, The Mullets, the final season of Spin City, A Minute with Stan Hooper, etc); and that's why they ultimately fail.  Shows such as KING OF QUEENS, EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND, MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE, etc flow effortlessle; the jokes just seem natural.  Much like THE COSBY SHOW and CHEERS (Both better shows, but that's really beside the point here), they're also realistic:  unlike most other sitcoms, THE KING OF QUEENS mirrors our lives; the ups, the downs, the trials, and the tribulations.

And wow I laughed pretty much the whole time I watched the series.I sat down and watched the whole set in 2 sittings, the time just flew by.  And best of all just when you're sad theirs no more eps to watch you look at the extras and you see 2 more eps hidden! =DThe character development throughout the first season is great author is such a character ( as are everyone ) I remember author is sitting at the table and tells Doug he would like to go to &quot;dominoes&quot; and Doug's like who and realizes its dominos.  Author is just way to funny and highly paranoid and goes overboard pretty much every episode.  And you have Spence (a guy who is in his 20's and lives at home with his mom) who is also a great addition to the show (the Valentines Day episode is truly evil for him!).  And of course the whole show is full of moments of true greatness.

It took a blizzard and my friend's box of DVD's to get me to watch the first two seasons. We started watching them and man oh man was I hooked. First of all Kevin James is one of the funniest guys I have seen on TV in the past few years. He's just full of energy and best of all you get this vibe that he's just playing himself and it's not an act so it's extra funny. Leah Remini is perfect as Kevin's wife cause she is a very unique actress and supports the show well.Now everything I see Jerry Stiller in he automatically sticks out, I really don't think he can help it since he has a very loud voice and makes it clear what he wants. It's crazy how Jerry Stiller actually acts the same way he did in Seinfeld when he was George's dad but he's still hilarious as Carrie's dad. What's even funnier is how Doug (Kevin James) is always hungry and will do whatever for a good meal, like leaving Carrie in the rain after she just got her hair done just to get an apple pie with hot fudge on it.

Fans of Kevin  James , Leah Remini, and Jerry Stiller will be in seventh heaven with this first season set. The show  is sort of an updated &quot;Honeymooners&quot; and an absolute laugh riot. It is definitely a keeper and well worth having in one's collection.Kevin James plays the role of the role of the portly, but adorable, Doug Heffernan, an International Parcel Service delivery guy and  husband to the earthy and sexy Carrie (Leah Remini), who clearly rules the roost. They live in a modest house in Queens, one of the outer boroughs of New York City.  Carrie's father, the idiosyncratic Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), for reasons made clear in the pilot episode, also joins their household. His living with them adds to the many comedic moments of this popular television series. There is a funny group of friends, odd neighbors, and other assorted characters that drift in and out of the Heffernans' daily lives, adding to the comedic zest of this comedy series about middle class life in one of the outer boroughs of New York City.The casting is perfect. The series is very funny with well-written scripts and excellent performances by its very talented cast. What more can a viewer ask for? This is an excellent, value laden, three disc DVD set, replete with a pilot episode commentary by Kevin James and the show's creator, Executive Producer Michael Weithorn. This DVD set also has a feature in which  the cast of the series takes the viewer behind the scenes, as they look back on and reminisce about the show's first season. All in all, this is a value priced DVD with crisp, clear  visuals and audio. It is absolutely one of my favorite comedies, and I am happy to have the entire first season.

I also loved listening to the comments of the actors and the creator of the show about the success of the show and the characters they play.One of my favorite episodes from the first season is entitled Best Man where Doug and Carrie attend the wedding of one of Carrie's old boyfriends and embarass themselves completely.  I also loved the episode where Carrie's father Arthur has a romantic fling with Doug's aunt which drives Doug crazy.  I really enjoyed  the episode where Carrie goes shopping for Thanksgiving dinner, but she has no idea what to buy.  I love watching The King of Queens very much.  I hope the other 5 seasons of the show are released on DVD eventually.",5,My review of The King of Queens- The First Season,1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,1179,"['King', 'Queens', 'funniest', 'show', 'TV', 'Kevin', 'James', 'Leah', 'Remini', 'Kevin', 'James', 'Doug', 'Carrie', 'Heffernen', 'have', 'such', 'great', 'chemistry', 'married', 'couple', 'loved', 'Jerry', 'Stiller', 'character', 'Arthur', 'who', 'Carrie', 'father', 'so', 'paranoid', 'lovable', 'First', 'Season', 'King', 'Queens', '3', 'disc', 'package', 'entire', 'first', 'season', '25', 'episodes', '2', 'bonus', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'also', 'fun', 'extra', 'features', 'collection', 'short', 'funny', 'clips', 'show', 'also', 'loved', 'listening', 'comments', 'actors', 'creator', 'show', 'success', 'show', 'characters', 'play.One', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'entitled', 'Best', 'Man', 'where', 'Doug', 'Carrie', 'attend', 'wedding', 'one', 'Carrie', 'old', 'boyfriends', 'embarass', 'completely', 'also', 'loved', 'episode', 'where', 'Carrie', 'father', 'Arthur', 'romantic', 'fling', 'Doug', 'aunt', 'Doug', 'crazy', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'episode', 'where', 'Carrie', 'shopping', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'idea', 'what', 'buy', 'love', 'watching', 'King', 'Queens', 'very', 'much', 'hope', 'other', '5', 'seasons', 'show', 'are', 'released', 'DVD', 'eventually']",The King of Queens: Season 1
776445,A3FDO58UAHVQD1,B0000CGNEC,Servo,"[18, 21]","I didn't start watching ""The King of Queens"" right away. I knew it was from the producers of two my of all-time favorite sitcoms ""Mr. Belvedere"", and ""Ned & Stacey"", and yet I didn't get around to watching it until the end of the first season. Even then I only watched it because a TV buddy of mine kept urging me to check it out because he thought I might get into the show like I did with Ned & Stacey. It took a few episodes, but The King of Queens eventually grew on me, becoming my must-see Monday night comedy. In fact, it's the only comedy that I watch on CBS. Everybody loves Raymond, except me. For me, The King of Queens really was the King of CBS Monday night comedy. CBS, stupidly,  moves the show to Wednesdays this season. But, I digress.""The King"" is Doug Heffernan, a hefty IPS parcel driver played with great comedic cluelessness by comedian Kevin James. James is hilarious with his dopey facial expressions and reactions. Doug lives in Queens with his wife Carrie, a legal secretary played with gusto by Leah Remini - who FINALLY found a sitcom that truly suits her spitfire talent. Doug's happy home is usurped by the presence of his father-in-law Arthur Spooner played by Jerry Stiller, who basically does what he did in Seinfeld, but somehow makes it still seem fresh in this show. I crack a smile at how he always greets Doug with ""Douglas.""Doug & Carrie's marital dynamic is reminiscent of Ralph and Alice Kramden from The Honeymooners. Physicalities aside, the similarities are undeniable. Doug and Ralph are both hefty, hard-working, blue collar guys who both drive for a living, with schemes that always incite their wives. Alice and Carrie both have spitfire personalities, and are not afraid to speak their minds, and yet totally devoted to their husbands. Doug's friends Deacon Palmer (Victor Williams), Spence Olchin (Patton Oswalt), and cousin Danny Heffernan (Gary Valentine - Kevin James' real-life sibling) alternate as Ed Norton facsimilies.The episodes themselves have a quirky charm that fans of Newhart and Ned & Stacey will appreciate. Given Ned & Stacey's premature demise, I didn't want to get attached to another Michael J. Weithorn show, because I didn't think it would last. That was five years ago, and the show is still on the air. With this DVD, I can now see all of those original episodes that I missed out on complete and uncut. And so can you.
