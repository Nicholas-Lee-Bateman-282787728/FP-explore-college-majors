I think the movie makers just filmed people then ran the film through a computer and told it to turn the people into drawings.  The results are stupendously bad.  Very unrealistic and the movie making method threw away the best uses of true animation.  Bad plot to boot.In short, the movie has nothing to recommend it.AD2",1,Bad in Every Way,1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,413,"['opening', 'moments', 'movie', 'knew', 'was', 'terrible', 'animation', 'horrible', 'think', 'movie', 'makers', 'just', 'filmed', 'people', 'then', 'ran', 'film', 'computer', 'told', 'turn', 'people', 'drawings', 'results', 'are', 'stupendously', 'bad', 'Very', 'unrealistic', 'movie', 'making', 'method', 'threw', 'away', 'best', 'uses', 'true', 'animation', 'Bad', 'plot', 'boot.In', 'short', 'movie', 'nothing', 'recommend', 'it.AD2']",Mars

It was a movie about space programs, space travel & a peopled mission on mars, so that to me, at least, qualifies it as sci-fi.  I thought the idea of some guy's snot creating life on mars was pretty funny & a nice touch.  The only thing that way past my normal suspension of disbelief was the size of the the space ship's living quarters & the pool.  Seemed more like a space colony than a space ship!  (Looked a lot like the space colonies on early Gundam animes, too.)  Also the sewing machine, though that was part of a story line thread that ran throughout the movie.  The TV interviewers reminded me of The Hunger Games & the constantly changing hair styles on the astronauts were hilarious (although again, way past even slightly believable).  I was  glad for the happy ending, too.  I had thought the 'alien identifier' would nuke the planet when it identified 'intelligent' life, but it didn't (guess that shows how much I think of the American government!).  It was a humorous, leave you feeling good, light-hearted movie.  The bit during the credits where they showed some of the 'making of' with the green suits was great, too.  I found this to be a hidden gem (yes, it's low budget, so maybe a zircon instead of a diamond, but still shiny regardless!) & one of the better 'unkown' films I've found on Amazon so far.  I'm glad I watched it.",5,"Fun, cute & enjoyable",1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,1453,"['liked', 'was', 'made', 'very', 'simple', 'animation', 'using', 'real', 'actors', 'was', 'cool', 'nonetheless', 'was', 'movie', 'space', 'programs', 'space', 'travel', 'peopled', 'mission', 'mars', 'so', 'least', 'sci-fi', 'thought', 'idea', 'guy', 'snot', 'creating', 'life', 'mars', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'nice', 'touch', 'only', 'thing', 'way', 'normal', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'was', 'size', 'space', 'ship', 'living', 'quarters', 'pool', 'Seemed', 'more', 'space', 'colony', 'space', 'ship', 'Looked', 'lot', 'space', 'colonies', 'early', 'Gundam', 'animes', 'too', 'Also', 'sewing', 'machine', 'was', 'part', 'story', 'line', 'thread', 'ran', 'movie', 'TV', 'interviewers', 'reminded', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'constantly', 'changing', 'hair', 'styles', 'astronauts', 'were', 'hilarious', 'again', 'way', 'even', 'slightly', 'believable', 'was', 'glad', 'happy', 'ending', 'too', 'had', 'thought', ""'alien"", 'identifier', 'would', 'nuke', 'planet', 'when', 'identified', ""'intelligent"", 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'guess', 'how', 'much', 'think', 'American', 'government', 'was', 'humorous', 'leave', 'feeling', 'good', 'light-hearted', 'movie', 'bit', 'credits', 'where', 'showed', ""'making"", 'green', 'suits', 'was', 'great', 'too', 'found', 'be', 'hidden', 'gem', 'yes', 'low', 'budget', 'so', 'maybe', 'zircon', 'instead', 'diamond', 'still', 'shiny', 'regardless', 'one', 'better', 'films', ""'ve"", 'found', 'Amazon', 'so', 'far', ""'m"", 'glad', 'watched']",Mars
