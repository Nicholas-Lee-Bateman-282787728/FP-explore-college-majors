1166834,A2VMT89TCSF105,B001AQMBI2,"Ashtar Command ""Seeker""","[3, 3]","It's been a while since I saw this one.""First Wave"" is a Canadian science fiction series. The pilot is one of the better sci fi productions I've seen. The main character, Cade Foster, gets his life destroyed by a series of mysterious events, which turn out to be orchestrated by a group of aliens preparing an invasion of our planet. Unfortunately for the aliens (known as the Gua), Foster is a security expert and former thief, and he therefore manages to escape from the mental asylum where they have locked up a number of human subjects.In the rest of the series, Foster roams North America, hoping to somehow stop the alien invasion. He develops a complicated relationship with Joshua, a dissident Gua posing as an African-American. The prophecies of Nostradamus and a conspiracy theorist named Crazy Eddie also play important roles in this series. I don't remember exactly how the show developed, but I think it has an inconclusive ending. Apparently, the network cancelled the show due to bad ratings.""First Wave"" is heavily dependent on the conspiracy subculture that thrived during the 1990's. It's all in there: Nostradamus, a paranoid guy living in a trailer, alien beings posing as humans, repressed memories... For this reason, the series might give a dated impression. After all, conspiracism doesn't feel very fashionable anymore. We have other fads. Still, I think the series is worth watching. My favourite episode is ""Speaking in tongues"", where Foster deprograms an entire religious cult centred on worship of one of the Gua. The cultists respond by turning Foster into their new saviour! An unfortunate insight into human psychology.Three seasons of ""First Wave"" were produced. I suppose this DVD will only include the first season. Some episodes have been uploaded on Youtube by fans, for those who want a sneaky preview.",4,"Worth watching, but perhaps out of fashion",1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,1841,"['been', 'while', 'saw', 'one', 'First', 'Wave', 'Canadian', 'science', 'fiction', 'series', 'pilot', 'one', 'better', 'sci', 'fi', 'productions', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'main', 'character', 'Cade', 'Foster', 'life', 'destroyed', 'series', 'mysterious', 'events', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'orchestrated', 'group', 'aliens', 'preparing', 'invasion', 'planet', 'Unfortunately', 'aliens', 'known', 'Gua', 'Foster', 'security', 'expert', 'former', 'thief', 'therefore', 'escape', 'mental', 'asylum', 'where', 'have', 'locked', 'up', 'number', 'human', 'subjects.In', 'rest', 'series', 'Foster', 'roams', 'North', 'America', 'hoping', 'somehow', 'stop', 'alien', 'invasion', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'Joshua', 'dissident', 'Gua', 'posing', 'African-American', 'prophecies', 'Nostradamus', 'conspiracy', 'theorist', 'named', 'Crazy', 'Eddie', 'also', 'play', 'important', 'roles', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'exactly', 'how', 'show', 'developed', 'think', 'inconclusive', 'ending', 'Apparently', 'network', 'cancelled', 'show', 'due', 'bad', 'ratings', 'First', 'Wave', 'heavily', 'dependent', 'conspiracy', 'subculture', 'thrived', '1990', 'Nostradamus', 'paranoid', 'guy', 'living', 'trailer', 'alien', 'beings', 'posing', 'humans', 'repressed', 'memories', 'reason', 'series', 'might', 'give', 'dated', 'impression', 'conspiracism', ""n't"", 'feel', 'very', 'fashionable', 'anymore', 'have', 'other', 'fads', 'Still', 'think', 'series', 'worth', 'watching', 'favourite', 'episode', 'Speaking', 'tongues', 'where', 'Foster', 'entire', 'religious', 'cult', 'centred', 'worship', 'one', 'Gua', 'cultists', 'respond', 'turning', 'Foster', 'new', 'saviour', 'unfortunate', 'insight', 'human', 'psychology.Three', 'seasons', 'First', 'Wave', 'were', 'produced', 'suppose', 'DVD', 'will', 'only', 'include', 'first', 'season', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'uploaded', 'Youtube', 'fans', 'who', 'want', 'sneaky', 'preview']",First Wave 1998 TVseries

1166838,A26F0H4X95PSPN,B001AQMBI2,"Frosty Cold One ""earthpigsprotege""","[0, 0]","For years the only way to attain this show was by way of torrents. Finally it got released, and now it has vanished from circulation. I'm guessing this Canadian DVD release didn't sell very well, as season 2 never made it to DVD. And what a pity: this show wasn't bad. I used to refer to it as the ""Canadian X-files,"" but honestly that isn't fair to either show. First Wave lacked some of the important qualities that immortalized the X-files, but it also offered distinct features of its own and didn't simply try to copy the X-files formula for success (for example using an ex-con as the hero instead of G-men). You'll notice during the closing credits that Francis Ford Coppola was executive producer on the show (that should say something, right?) Although there is nothing original about an alien invasion story arc, First Wave was innovative in how it portrayed the invasion and the resistance.Season 1 is engaging (if you love sci-fi) and it sets the stage for a struggle that lasts 3 full seasons of 22 episodes each. I wasn't impressed by the pilot episode, but I was hooked after being introduced to ""Crazy Eddie"" (portrayed by Rob LaBelle) in episode 2. The charismatic protagonist Cade Foster (played by Sebastian Spence) was well cast, although there was no Dana Scully to accompany him (Traci Lords becomes his alien-hunting comrade in season 3, but her character has nothing in common with Dana Scully other than both being gun-toting redheads).If you are a sci-fi enthusiast and come across this DVD set being sold, snag it. Even if you find that you don't like the show, it's a good investment (you'll be able to sell it online as an OOP collector's item with what looks like a small print run).",3,"If you see it for sale, snatch it up...it's now a collector's item",1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,1713,"['years', 'only', 'way', 'attain', 'show', 'was', 'way', 'torrents', 'Finally', 'got', 'released', 'now', 'vanished', 'circulation', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'Canadian', 'DVD', 'release', 'did', ""n't"", 'sell', 'very', 'well', 'season', '2', 'never', 'made', 'DVD', 'what', 'pity', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'used', 'refer', 'Canadian', 'X-files', 'honestly', ""n't"", 'fair', 'show', 'First', 'Wave', 'lacked', 'important', 'qualities', 'immortalized', 'X-files', 'also', 'offered', 'distinct', 'features', 'own', 'did', ""n't"", 'simply', 'try', 'copy', 'X-files', 'formula', 'success', 'example', 'using', 'ex-con', 'hero', 'instead', 'G-men', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'closing', 'credits', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'was', 'executive', 'producer', 'show', 'should', 'say', 'something', 'right', 'nothing', 'original', 'alien', 'invasion', 'story', 'arc', 'First', 'Wave', 'was', 'innovative', 'how', 'portrayed', 'invasion', 'resistance.Season', '1', 'engaging', 'love', 'sci-fi', 'stage', 'struggle', '3', 'full', 'seasons', '22', 'episodes', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'pilot', 'episode', 'was', 'hooked', 'being', 'introduced', 'Crazy', 'Eddie', 'portrayed', 'Rob', 'LaBelle', 'episode', '2', 'charismatic', 'protagonist', 'Cade', 'Foster', 'played', 'Sebastian', 'Spence', 'was', 'well', 'cast', 'was', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'accompany', 'Traci', 'Lords', 'alien-hunting', 'comrade', 'season', '3', 'character', 'nothing', 'common', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'other', 'being', 'gun-toting', 'redheads', '.If', 'are', 'sci-fi', 'enthusiast', 'come', 'DVD', 'set', 'being', 'sold', 'snag', 'Even', 'find', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'show', 'good', 'investment', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'sell', 'online', 'OOP', 'collector', 'item', 'what', 'small', 'print', 'run']",First Wave 1998 TVseries
