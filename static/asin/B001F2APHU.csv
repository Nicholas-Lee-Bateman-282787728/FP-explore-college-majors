1187575,A192M52FYCQFKD,B001F2APHU,A. Carney,"[4, 4]","This dvd is the best workout for your stomach.  It exercises your entire body with added emphasis on the stomach area.  This will make you sweat and by the time you get to the butt section, you will be sweating profusely.  Many workout videos move on to another exercise just when I feel like I am able to execute the move more accurately.  Not this one, you do each movement for long enough to feel your muscle contracting the way it is supposed to contract.  I do not have any babies, but I do gain weight in my stomach more than other areas so this workout is just perfect for me.  Tracy does encourage you to keep going when perhaps you should not.  I injured my shoulder during her arm workout in the mat dvd.  I could not exercise for a little over a week, so it did not do me any good to force my arms past their limit.  I think the encouragement to keep pushing yourself is good,however we should listen carefully to our bodies at the same time.  This workout does not include cardio, which Tracy says you must combine with this floor work video to obtain maximum results.  Overall, this workout is awesome and is a must for anyone!",5,My favorite workout,1236211200,"03 5, 2009",2009,1140,"['dvd', 'best', 'workout', 'stomach', 'entire', 'body', 'added', 'emphasis', 'stomach', 'area', 'will', 'make', 'sweat', 'time', 'get', 'butt', 'section', 'will', 'be', 'sweating', 'profusely', 'Many', 'workout', 'videos', 'move', 'exercise', 'just', 'when', 'feel', 'am', 'able', 'execute', 'move', 'more', 'accurately', 'Not', 'one', 'do', 'movement', 'long', 'enough', 'feel', 'muscle', 'contracting', 'way', 'supposed', 'contract', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'babies', 'do', 'gain', 'weight', 'stomach', 'more', 'other', 'areas', 'workout', 'just', 'perfect', 'Tracy', 'encourage', 'keep', 'going', 'when', 'perhaps', 'should', 'not', 'injured', 'shoulder', 'arm', 'workout', 'mat', 'dvd', 'could', 'not', 'exercise', 'little', 'week', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'good', 'force', 'arms', 'past', 'limit', 'think', 'encouragement', 'keep', 'pushing', 'good', 'however', 'should', 'listen', 'carefully', 'bodies', 'same', 'time', 'workout', 'not', 'include', 'cardio', 'Tracy', 'must', 'combine', 'floor', 'work', 'video', 'obtain', 'maximum', 'results', 'Overall', 'workout', 'awesome', 'must', 'anyone']",The Tracy Anderson Method Presents Post-Pregnancy Workout DVD
1187576,AKOR2SCPHOKS2,B001F2APHU,"AMG ""AMG""","[1, 1]","I gave this 4 stars because I enjoy the workout itself.  But I am extremely disappointed with Tracy.  You can barely hear her speak, if she speaks at all.  And her hair is complete distraction for her... she is constantly getting it out of her eyes and off her shoulders.  You never know how many reps she is going to do because she doesn't say and she doesn't do a countdown.  She doesn't give you helpful hints like, ""breathe in, breathe out,"" or ""focus on xyz bodypart.""  Or if she does, she gives it toward the end of the repitition when you're almost done.  Also, there is no beat with the music (classical) so it's hard to follow her rhythm, you basically have to watch her the entire time.  She starts out ok in the beginning but by the cool down she has stopped speaking completely and you just have to follow her lead.  Didn't she get feedback from others before releasing the DVD?  She could've put forth a little more effort and made it awesome instead of mediocre.  All that aside, I do like her exercises and they're very different from what I'm used to.  I felt sore in all the right places.

There are many things I love about this DVD:-tough workout in 47 minutes-classical background music adds a lovely vibe-fun, I look forward to doing it- minimal talkingThe only thing I would add is chaptering so you could just do a specific section in a time crunch.

1187593,A28FJ93TJSSQS4,B001F2APHU,LMS,"[0, 0]","This is a 45 minute Pilates-based workout that is pitched as a postnatal workout.  I have mixed feelings about this one.  The workout is fairly tough and thoroughly targets the abs, core, butt, and arms.  If you worked out your entire pregnancy and maintained core strength, this is hard but doable.  If you stopped exercising or were not active during pregnancy, this might be one to work up to.  One of the cons of this workout is modifications are given for only some of the exercises. I would also only recommend this workout to someone who is familiar with Pilates because instruction on proper form and technique is absent from the vast majority of the exercises.  For example, she makes a comment about how you can strain your back if you don't activate your leg but she doesn't explain what it means to activate your leg.  Since correct form is essential for maximizing results and avoiding injury, the absence of instruction is a definite negative here.  Most of the shooting is done head on, so you can't rely on multiple camera angles to help you get the moves right.  Also, this is targeted as a postnatal workout that is very abs and core focused yet she doesn't really discuss diastasis and which exercises should be modified or avoided if someone has diastasis. Another negative is the absence of cueing.  She often does not say when a set is completed or when it is time to switch sides.  This is a problem for exercises when proper form entails looking at the ground and not the screen.Pros:Tough and comprehensive workout for core, abs, butt, and arms.  Will firm and tone these areas.Cons:Poor instruction regarding form.Few modifications for beginners.Little to no cueing.Makes odd comments like &#34;get the skin to come back to the muscle&#34;.

I started doing this workout about a week ago and I really think it is working. Many of the advanced ab moves were too hard for me to do at first, but like others have said, they do get easier so obviously the video is doing its job! I was a bit disappointed at first that there wasn't any cardio, but it was a nice refresher to just focus on small movements, especially in the beginning when you are just getting back into things. I hadn't heard of Tracy Anderson before but she is super sweet, understanding, and motivating throughout the workout. My ONLY dislikes with this tape is that 1) she does odd footwork with her arm exercises/cooldown moves, just because she is a dancer by nature, so it was a bit hard for me to follow and I just do my own thing now; 2) the music is classical, which may be a plus for some, but I almost feel like I'm working out in silence since I like music that gets me energized; and 3) I am unable to &#34;skip&#34; to different parts of the workout if I want to jump to the arm exercises, for example. It seems that the only designated chapters are the workout and Gwenyth Paltrow's endorsement, so you have to manually fast-forward which isn't too big of a hassle overall.The workout is definitely challenging - especially the butt exercises - but it seems to be pulling everything back together, so I would recommend this to all new mommies (or even those just trying to tone up!).",4,Challenging toning workout!,1383782400,"11 7, 2013",2013,1544,"['sister', 'gave', 'was', 'pregnant', 'am', 'fitness', 'buff', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'body', 'back', 'baby', 'started', 'doing', 'workout', 'week', 'ago', 'really', 'think', 'working', 'Many', 'advanced', 'ab', 'moves', 'were', 'too', 'hard', 'do', 'first', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'do', 'get', 'easier', 'so', 'obviously', 'video', 'doing', 'job', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'first', 'was', ""n't"", 'cardio', 'was', 'nice', 'refresher', 'just', 'focus', 'small', 'movements', 'especially', 'beginning', 'when', 'are', 'just', 'getting', 'back', 'things', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'Tracy', 'Anderson', 'super', 'sweet', 'understanding', 'motivating', 'workout', 'ONLY', 'dislikes', 'tape', '1', 'odd', 'footwork', 'arm', 'exercises/cooldown', 'moves', 'just', 'dancer', 'nature', 'was', 'bit', 'hard', 'follow', 'just', 'do', 'own', 'thing', 'now', '2', 'music', 'classical', 'may', 'be', 'plus', 'almost', 'feel', ""'m"", 'working', 'out', 'silence', 'like', 'music', 'energized', '3', 'am', 'unable', '34', 'skip', '34', 'different', 'parts', 'workout', 'want', 'jump', 'arm', 'example', 'only', 'designated', 'chapters', 'are', 'workout', 'Gwenyth', 'Paltrow', 'endorsement', 'have', 'manually', 'fast-forward', ""n't"", 'too', 'big', 'hassle', 'overall.The', 'workout', 'definitely', 'challenging', 'especially', 'butt', 'be', 'pulling', 'everything', 'back', 'together', 'would', 'recommend', 'new', 'mommies', 'even', 'just', 'trying', 'tone', 'up']",The Tracy Anderson Method Presents Post-Pregnancy Workout DVD

I haven't had a baby in 10 years, but I've got the typical trouble spots of any 40-something woman, and I thought this DVD might help. It did!  As in the Mat workout, I find that Tracy acts a bit pouty, but I find her very likable.  There's more direction in this one vs. Mat, but not so much that it's annoying.  The music in this one is pleasant, it reminds me of the background music in a Disney film or something.  I find this to be heavier on abs than Mat, which I expected.  That's ok with me, but in this workout, some of the ab exercises are done without neck support (as opposed to in her Mat workout, where the neck was supported in each exercise).  This is a biggy with me, as I've got a sensitive neck that if treated wrong, will be out of whack for days.  I am able to modify things a bit in order to fully support my neck, though, so I'm still able to do all the moves.  Maybe not as effectively as Tracy, but effectively enough, as I certainly felt this the next day!  This is lighter in the arms than Mat, but still a good series of exercises that will produce results, in my opinion.  I love the leg/butt exercises in this DVD, maybe even more than in Mat, because I really felt the burn in this one.  And I'm getting results after alternating this with her Mat workout for 4 weeks, 4-6 times a week.  I'm getting definition in spots that I don't ever recall having definition, and my clothes are getting looser.  Yippee!  Great workout--give it a try.

Sarah,"[14, 18]","I'm a cardio junkie who is finally on the path to barre-style enlightenment, and I credit Tracy Anderson entirely with introducing me to these kinds of amazingly effective workouts. Her original Mat Workout DVD actually changed my life... not to mention my lean yet totally noodly and undefined runner's body. I've heard mixed things about the Perfect design series and I am NOT willing to shell out $90 for the Metamorphosis set (which includes a dance cardio DVD, and I LOATHE dance cardio and will never ever EVER spend a penny on it), but I decided to take the plunge and check this out.Hands down, this is the best abdominal workout currently on the market. I am not exaggerating. My core strength has improved enormously since starting barre workouts months ago, but this completely kicked my ass (well, abs). I've borrowed the notorious P90X Ab Ripper DVD from my boyfriend a handful of times, and this is definitely more challenging.The ab exercises in this DVD are COMPLETELY different from those offered in the Mat DVD, not to mention that you're spending over twice as long working your core than you are in the Mat DVD. The exercises are remarkable in their range. Some are very small and focused, whereas others are much more dynamic and even involve other muscle groups; often you'll find yourself getting a fantastic leg workout by proxy of the insane moves offered up by Tracy!The only thing that sort of bothered me about this DVD was the lack of a weighted arm sequence. As a runner, my arms tend to be my least toned feature, and it really gets my goat when I finish a workout without really feeling like I'm targeting my problem area. However, there are some great resources online for getting your Tracy arm workout fix; just check out Youtube for her arm webisode, and for an additional 10 minutes you can squeeze in a FANTASTIC arm set. On other days when I want to switch things up, I'll just skip ahead in my Mat workout DVD to the arms series and just do that.Also, I'd be doing the producers a real disservice if I didn't talk about how lovely this DVD is in presentation. It's shot in the day as opposed to dusk (which always kind of bummed me out in her Mat DVD) in Gwyneth Paltrow's Hamptons house, and Tracy is in front of a cozy pile of pillows instead of the stark wall. What I REALLY love about this workout is how it's set to classical music instead of the standard workout pop fare; it makes for a really great and relaxing change of pace during one of the hardest workouts out there.Moral of the story: if you like the comprehensive Mat DVD but want to find something a little more targeted, buy this.

I was worried I wouldn't like the classical music in the background, as I'm used to something more upbeat. But, I really enjoy it. It's a good change of pace, almost relaxing by making you feel good about what you're doing. Tracy spends the first 28 minutes of this 47 minute workout targeting your abs, then moves to legs and glutes for 10 minutes and arms for maybe 5. There is a short cool down at the end and a short warm-up in the beginning. It does target abs more than anything else, but I still felt my arms and legs working during the ab workout. I also felt sore the next day, so she must be working your arms and legs somehow! I think pairing it with other strength workouts and something with cardio would help.

I wanted a &#34;beginner&#34; version of the Tracy Anderson workouts and this fits the bill. I still find it challenging and I now have some of her other workout videos as well. The instructions in this are better than some of her other videos (e.g. Meta) where she doesn't give you any cues at all. The only thing I don't like is that a lot of the legwork is done on the hands and knees because my wrists hurt after a while-if you have the same problem I recommend her Mat workout where most of the leg work is standing.,4,Good workout video,1383523200,"11 4, 2013",2013,577,"['am', 'not', 'pregnant', 'really', 'workout', 'video', 'wanted', '34', 'beginner', '34', 'version', 'Tracy', 'Anderson', 'workouts', 'bill', 'still', 'find', 'challenging', 'now', 'have', 'other', 'workout', 'videos', 'as', 'well', 'instructions', 'are', 'better', 'other', 'videos', 'e.g', 'Meta', 'where', ""n't"", 'give', 'cues', 'only', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'lot', 'legwork', 'done', 'hands', 'knees', 'wrists', 'hurt', 'while-if', 'have', 'same', 'problem', 'recommend', 'Mat', 'workout', 'where', 'most', 'leg', 'work', 'standing']",The Tracy Anderson Method Presents Post-Pregnancy Workout DVD

1187606,A35AZI8ZY6FC6R,B001F2APHU,SublimeLife,"[1, 1]","I just got this DVD and I'm already seeing a change! My baby just turned one and I'm battling the last 10lbs I gained during my pregnancy. I started working out right at 6 weeks doing workouts in spurts at home on my own and I have to say that it worked well and I was getting compliments when I returned to work. But I hit a plateau and went through a period of great stress between the summer and fall, which included the death of my father.  In July, joined a gym for the first time in 20 years to try to work through the stressful times, which helped, but I wasn't able to shake the last 10lbs. Last week I decided to go back to working out at home for a while, since it's where I typically get results.I got this DVD yesterday and did it at night when my kids went to sleep. I don't normally jump right into a DVD, they sit around for a while but I scanned through it and it looked excellent so I said, ""Why not?"" and gave it a try. I felt great while I was doing it and pretty amazing today, much tighter. My jeans fit better, my abs felt pulled in and that motivated me to want to do it again tonight - and I did! It was pretty tough the second time through. I felt the deep muscles ""wake up"" as she says and was pretty sore from last night but I made through the whole thing.Here are my initial observations and thoughts as someone who has a sizable workout DVD library.1) Her cues are almost inaudible when you're on your back and switching sides, so it's easy to overdo it on one side. You HAVE to watch her closely and/or turn the volume up!2) The workout is in sections i.e. warm up, abs, legs, arms, and stretches but the DVD isn't chapterized that way and it's not easy to find the section you want if you have to do 5 minutes here and there with your baby. Kind of a bummer considering that's her audience. But, if you watch it and become familiar with it or do the whole DVD once, you can scan through and find the section you want - not as easy as clicking a labeled section chapter but it can be done.3) This is an intense workout!! I gave birth a year ago and work out regularly but I found some of the ab moves quite taxing and not great for my lower back. She mentions this but it might be incredibly challenging if you're 6-12 weeks post-partum. So, take it slow ladies and don't risk an injury.4) Time FLIES!! I have a bunch of other mat workouts: barre, callinetics, pilates, yoga, etc. and they creep by compared to this one. It just really flows nicely and the music is soft but not annoying, that describes Tracy as well. She's very encouraging and she keeps you moving without too much talk. In fact, a bit more description in some places may have helped.5) The arms section is a bit confusing. Again, this is an issue of not cuing well and not describing the moves while she's doing them. You have to watch her closely and imitate what she's doing. She also does some dance positions with her legs and it's not clear whether they are necessary or if you're only supposed to be focusing on her arms, she doesn't say much here. But, it's only day 2 for me and I feel a lengthening in my neck, arms and shoulders. My shoulders feel more pulled back and down, something I was hoping for, so  I'm pleased!!6) The stretch section at the end moves WAY too fast. Even if she took one full minute longer overall, it would be better. It feels rushed, and again she's not saying much about her legs and the importance of the dance positions. Just as soon as you copy her and get into the right position, she's on to the next and you don't have time to feel the stretch. Not good. I decided to hold them longer and rewind if I had to catch up. But not everyone with a baby can do this! With all the deep muscle work, stretching is super important.  Seriously, the last thing you want is a calf or leg cramp while your in bed nursing or feeding your baby at night.7) It's not available in Amazon's instant video (streamed). Overall, I'm very happy I spent the $6.99 for this DVD. But, I wish I could have bought it electronically for streaming, then I could do this workout at my gym where I have guaranteed ""me"" time with onsite daycare. Maybe one day soon.8) It's worth noting that Tracy admits in the interview portion that she doesn't recommend anything other than cardio with this workout, since she knows that it works and she'd rather you see results doing it her way. This statement will help me let go of some of the weight and cable workouts I do at the gym and keep it simple by doing only this (and probably a bit of yoga) for now.",4,Wish I found this sooner!,1382745600,"10 26, 2013",2013,4559,"['just', 'got', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'already', 'seeing', 'change', 'My', 'baby', 'just', 'turned', 'one', ""'m"", 'battling', 'last', '10lbs', 'gained', 'pregnancy', 'started', 'working', 'out', 'right', '6', 'weeks', 'doing', 'workouts', 'spurts', 'home', 'own', 'have', 'say', 'worked', 'well', 'was', 'getting', 'compliments', 'when', 'returned', 'work', 'hit', 'plateau', 'went', 'period', 'great', 'stress', 'summer', 'fall', 'included', 'death', 'father', 'July', 'joined', 'gym', 'first', 'time', '20', 'years', 'try', 'work', 'stressful', 'times', 'helped', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'shake', 'last', '10lbs', 'Last', 'week', 'decided', 'go', 'back', 'working', 'out', 'home', 'while', 'where', 'typically', 'get', 'results.I', 'got', 'DVD', 'yesterday', 'did', 'night', 'when', 'kids', 'went', 'sleep', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'jump', 'right', 'DVD', 'sit', 'while', 'scanned', 'looked', 'excellent', 'so', 'said', 'Why', 'not', 'gave', 'try', 'felt', 'great', 'was', 'doing', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'today', 'much', 'tighter', 'jeans', 'fit', 'better', 'abs', 'felt', 'pulled', 'motivated', 'want', 'do', 'again', 'tonight', 'did', 'was', 'pretty', 'tough', 'second', 'time', 'felt', 'deep', 'muscles', 'wake', 'up', 'was', 'pretty', 'sore', 'last', 'night', 'made', 'whole', 'are', 'initial', 'observations', 'thoughts', 'someone', 'who', 'sizable', 'workout', 'DVD', 'library.1', 'cues', 'are', 'almost', 'inaudible', 'when', ""'re"", 'back', 'switching', 'sides', 'easy', 'overdo', 'one', 'side', 'HAVE', 'watch', 'closely', 'and/or', 'turn', 'volume', 'up', '2', 'workout', 'sections', 'i.e', 'warm', 'up', 'abs', 'legs', 'arms', 'stretches', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'chapterized', 'way', 'not', 'easy', 'find', 'section', 'want', 'have', 'do', '5', 'minutes', 'here', 'there', 'baby', 'Kind', 'bummer', 'considering', 'audience', 'watch', 'become', 'familiar', 'do', 'whole', 'DVD', 'once', 'can', 'scan', 'find', 'section', 'want', 'not', 'as', 'easy', 'clicking', 'labeled', 'section', 'chapter', 'can', 'be', 'done.3', 'intense', 'workout', 'gave', 'birth', 'year', 'ago', 'work', 'out', 'regularly', 'found', 'ab', 'quite', 'taxing', 'not', 'great', 'lower', 'back', 'might', 'be', 'incredibly', 'challenging', ""'re"", '6-12', 'weeks', 'post-partum', 'So', 'take', 'slow', 'ladies', 'do', ""n't"", 'risk', 'injury.4', 'Time', 'FLIES', 'have', 'bunch', 'other', 'mat', 'workouts', 'barre', 'callinetics', 'pilates', 'yoga', 'etc', 'creep', 'compared', 'one', 'just', 'really', 'nicely', 'music', 'soft', 'not', 'annoying', 'Tracy', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'encouraging', 'moving', 'too', 'much', 'talk', 'fact', 'bit', 'more', 'description', 'places', 'may', 'have', 'helped.5', 'arms', 'section', 'bit', 'confusing', 'Again', 'issue', 'not', 'cuing', 'well', 'not', 'describing', 'moves', 'doing', 'have', 'watch', 'closely', 'imitate', 'what', 'doing', 'also', 'dance', 'positions', 'legs', 'not', 'clear', 'are', 'necessary', ""'re"", 'only', 'supposed', 'be', 'focusing', 'arms', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'here', 'only', 'day', '2', 'feel', 'lengthening', 'neck', 'arms', 'shoulders', 'shoulders', 'feel', 'more', 'pulled', 'back', 'down', 'something', 'was', 'hoping', ""'m"", 'pleased', '6', 'stretch', 'section', 'end', 'WAY', 'too', 'fast', 'Even', 'took', 'one', 'full', 'minute', 'longer', 'overall', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'rushed', 'again', 'not', 'saying', 'much', 'legs', 'importance', 'dance', 'positions', 'Just', 'as', 'soon', 'copy', 'get', 'right', 'position', 'next', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'feel', 'stretch', 'Not', 'good', 'decided', 'hold', 'longer', 'rewind', 'had', 'catch', 'up', 'not', 'everyone', 'baby', 'can', 'do', 'deep', 'muscle', 'work', 'stretching', 'super', 'important', 'Seriously', 'last', 'thing', 'want', 'calf', 'leg', 'cramp', 'bed', 'nursing', 'feeding', 'baby', 'night.7', 'not', 'available', 'Amazon', 'instant', 'video', 'streamed', 'Overall', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'spent', '6.99', 'DVD', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'bought', 'electronically', 'streaming', 'then', 'could', 'do', 'workout', 'gym', 'where', 'have', 'guaranteed', 'time', 'onsite', 'daycare', 'Maybe', 'one', 'day', 'soon.8', 'worth', 'noting', 'Tracy', 'interview', 'portion', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anything', 'other', 'cardio', 'workout', ""'d"", 'rather', 'see', 'results', 'doing', 'way', 'statement', 'will', 'help', 'let', 'go', 'weight', 'cable', 'workouts', 'do', 'gym', 'keep', 'simple', 'doing', 'only', 'probably', 'bit', 'yoga', 'now']",The Tracy Anderson Method Presents Post-Pregnancy Workout DVD

1187610,AATP629AVSJJU,B001F2APHU,Tymala,"[1, 3]","As my previous review of her mat work illustrates- I have my criticisms and praises of Tracy Anderson. Last summer while living in a rural village in Eurasia, DVD's at home were my only opportunity for exercise, and in many cases entertainment. I have a poochy belly and am at the size 8 body frame- 5'3 and often at 125 to 130ish pounds whenever I have weight to lose. I did her method last summer for 7 weeks, mat and cardio and had such little results with the exception of my arms. I got bored out of my mind and really wish that I had my hands on this video earlier to alternate with her mat to avoid boredom. If I used this video, perhaps my abs would have been better. It just might be one of the best ab workouts on the market.Unfortunately I am not the best reviewer for this DVD in many ways due to my shoulder injury that I had last autumn and it was right around the time that I started this video, so I have no long term results to report. Seven weeks of the mat, did not do so much. I was only able to do this video a few times before my injury and I still cannot do it nowadays due to my shoulder. But, I still think that others should give it a shot- I think I was on to something when I started this DVD. My abs were very sore and I loved the setting and the classical music. I do not think this video was so boring and the setting was very motivating. I did start to see and feel some results in a short time. So I advise to purchase this video over her mat work if you have post baby weight and/or some belly fat. And my personal advise is to use Tracy in your rotations of DVD's but do not follow her method to the tee if you get bored easily- again her method gave me little results. If I was not so injured today- I would rotate this DVD with her cardio (which does burn alot of fat) and some other DVD's that interest me such as Yoga Booty Ballet, Zumba, and Ministry of Sound. Do what works best for you and do not hold yourself hostage to only the Tracy Anderson method.
