967208,A1DPCXO7RDZM0S,B000E33W0S,Mick McAllister,"[0, 1]","I bought Dogs II because I'm a sucker for dog stories and Dogs I was charming. Dogs II, on the other hand, is such unrelieved garbage that I barely managed to screen the entire thing.The initial premise takes the conceit of the original film -- that there is a Heaven all dogs go to -- and tortures it into idiocy. Apparently the PTBs in this Heaven are such idiots that a dog who has sold his soul to the Devil to help steal ""Gabriel's horn"" cons them into giving him the ""Most Improved"" award... immediately before he steals the horn. And with this horn, the Devil can destroy both Heaven and Earth (Oh nooo).My favorite moment is when Charlie gets into the SFPD evidence room by tricking the guard into blowing the horn, which unlocks gates (except for the Pearly Gates, which it locks... Go figure). Having gotten into the room through this strategem, Charlie grabs the horn, the gate shuts behind him, and the next ten minutes involve trying to get the gate open again. Nobody thinks of blowing the horn. Sheesh.If you can get Dogs I for the same price as this set, take it. They should pay you to watch the sequel.",2,"First not bad, second sucks",1334448000,"04 15, 2012",2012,1120,"['bought', 'Dogs', 'II', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'dog', 'stories', 'Dogs', 'was', 'charming', 'Dogs', 'II', 'other', 'hand', 'such', 'unrelieved', 'garbage', 'barely', 'managed', 'screen', 'entire', 'thing.The', 'initial', 'premise', 'conceit', 'original', 'film', 'Heaven', 'dogs', 'go', 'idiocy', 'Apparently', 'PTBs', 'Heaven', 'are', 'such', 'idiots', 'dog', 'who', 'sold', 'soul', 'Devil', 'help', 'steal', 'Gabriel', 'horn', 'cons', 'giving', 'Most', 'Improved', 'award', 'immediately', 'horn', 'horn', 'Devil', 'can', 'destroy', 'Heaven', 'Earth', 'Oh', 'nooo', '.My', 'favorite', 'moment', 'when', 'Charlie', 'SFPD', 'evidence', 'room', 'tricking', 'guard', 'blowing', 'horn', 'gates', 'Pearly', 'Gates', 'Go', 'figure', 'Having', 'gotten', 'room', 'strategem', 'Charlie', 'grabs', 'horn', 'gate', 'shuts', 'next', 'ten', 'minutes', 'involve', 'trying', 'get', 'gate', 'open', 'again', 'Nobody', 'blowing', 'horn', 'Sheesh.If', 'can', 'get', 'Dogs', 'same', 'price', 'set', 'take', 'should', 'pay', 'watch', 'sequel']",N/A
