Book of Baruch 3-25.This is just a standard Hallmark film which used its bevy of standard Hallmark actors and the standard hallmark music.There is the standard dark stranger or two. And the estranged brother. Throw in a M&eacute;nage &agrave; Trois. We have swordplay, pistol play, flying machines, horsing around, poison wells, greedy sheiks, and the kitchen sink.Deep in the desert is a brilliantly lit gold door everybody wants to know what's behind it most people think it's just gold but of course we know better. Let's follow the four hour long struggle to see who gets the gold who gets the girl and who gets the shaft.If you're use Hallmark movies it's a good way to pass time. If not you may have trouble with some of the dud characters with the sophomoric dialog and the reuse props. But we need to look beyond that and concentrate on the half hearted message.Hallmark Collector Set V.1 (6-Movies)",2,Up to Hallmark quality,1252195200,"09 6, 2009",2009,989,"['universe', 'end', 'way', 'measure', 'how', 'wide', 'how', 'high', 'Book', 'Baruch', '3-25.This', 'just', 'standard', 'Hallmark', 'film', 'used', 'bevy', 'standard', 'Hallmark', 'actors', 'standard', 'hallmark', 'standard', 'dark', 'stranger', 'two', 'estranged', 'brother', 'Throw', 'M', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'Trois', 'have', 'swordplay', 'pistol', 'play', 'flying', 'machines', 'horsing', 'around', 'poison', 'wells', 'greedy', 'sheiks', 'kitchen', 'sink.Deep', 'desert', 'brilliantly', 'lit', 'gold', 'door', 'everybody', 'know', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'think', 'just', 'gold', 'course', 'know', 'better', 'Let', 'follow', 'four', 'hour', 'long', 'struggle', 'see', 'who', 'gold', 'who', 'girl', 'who', 'shaft.If', ""'re"", 'use', 'Hallmark', 'movies', 'good', 'way', 'pass', 'time', 'not', 'may', 'have', 'trouble', 'dud', 'characters', 'sophomoric', 'dialog', 'reuse', 'props', 'need', 'look', 'concentrate', 'half', 'hearted', 'message.Hallmark', 'Collector', 'Set', 'V.1', '6-Movies']",N/A

Olivier ""puttputtproductions""","[0, 0]","First of all, to all those who think only ""young"" kids don't like this film, I'm 48 and I love desert adventures and this is a baaaaaaaaad film.If this film had had any real direction and been edited correctly and some of the storylines either dropped or fixed, it could have been a fun desert adventure romance. There was a lot of potential with this film. And I must say that the funny bits between Rashid and Neal and their friendship was probably the best part. The romance part got a little sappy. And the sound track is like Eugene Ormandy on one of his sappiest days. I kept waiting to see that this film was made by a church - it has that kind of feel - like there's going to be a message. I think whomever did make this film was trying for a message rather than a plot and that's why it wandered all over the place. For example (SPOILER ALERT), after the girl and her husband/soldier/rescuer collapse in the desert and he dies and she's sent away with the monks, we never see her again. I mean, why was she in the story to begin with? If I'd written that story, I'd have had her traveling with Shannon so she could meet Dr. Hogan and then Hogan (Neal) would get a romance, too, at least. Maybe. And she'd get to see where her father always wanted to go. (SPOILER OVER) *sigh* I hate it when stupid people make stupid films.But like I said, it had a really good kernel/nugget of an idea. I'm glad I watched it because I'm going to take that idea and make a much better story out of it, I think. So, there's a reason for everything.",1,"Hey, I'm old and even I think this film sucks.",1326585600,"01 15, 2012",2012,1539,"['First', 'all', 'who', 'think', 'only', 'young', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', ""'m"", '48', 'love', 'desert', 'adventures', 'baaaaaaaaad', 'film.If', 'film', 'had', 'had', 'real', 'direction', 'been', 'edited', 'correctly', 'storylines', 'dropped', 'fixed', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fun', 'desert', 'adventure', 'romance', 'was', 'lot', 'potential', 'film', 'must', 'say', 'funny', 'bits', 'Rashid', 'Neal', 'friendship', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'part', 'romance', 'part', 'got', 'little', 'sappy', 'sound', 'track', 'Eugene', 'Ormandy', 'one', 'sappiest', 'days', 'kept', 'waiting', 'see', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'church', 'kind', 'feel', 'going', 'be', 'message', 'think', 'whomever', 'did', 'make', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'message', 'rather', 'plot', 'why', 'wandered', 'place', 'example', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'girl', 'husband/soldier/rescuer', 'collapse', 'desert', 'sent', 'away', 'monks', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'mean', 'why', 'was', 'story', 'begin', ""'d"", 'written', 'story', ""'d"", 'have', 'had', 'traveling', 'Shannon', 'could', 'meet', 'Dr.', 'Hogan', 'then', 'Hogan', 'Neal', 'would', 'get', 'romance', 'too', 'least', 'Maybe', ""'d"", 'get', 'see', 'where', 'father', 'always', 'wanted', 'go', 'SPOILER', 'OVER', '*sigh*', 'hate', 'when', 'stupid', 'people', 'make', 'stupid', 'films.But', 'said', 'had', 'really', 'good', 'kernel/nugget', 'idea', ""'m"", 'glad', 'watched', ""'m"", 'going', 'take', 'idea', 'make', 'much', 'better', 'story', 'think', 'So', 'reason', 'everything']",N/A
1055819,A1C87GAJNODOE6,B000NA78SO,"T. Thomas ""Mamadawg""","[1, 2]","I will begin by saying that this is a movie that has a lot going on in it--the main plot centers around two brothers, played by Ben Cross (Michael Shannon--alias ""Zadick"") and Peter Weller (Dr. John Shannon) who are trying to find the mysterious tower which can either be good for the world, or hold a power evil enough to leash hell on Earth. You know from the beginning that both of them knew about this tower since they were young boys.Is there romance? Yes there is. There are two couples involved, one of them also looking for the tower while the other only has one goal: survival.  I am not going to give away the whole plot, throughline and summary here because all of it is interwoven into a tale of love, loyalty, betrayal, hate, revenge, treachery, retribution and reconciliation. If you can handle all of that, then this movie is well worth buying--especially at the price.I agree with the other reviewer who stated that younger viewers are going to give this movie a poor rating because it is not a slasher flick. This movie is interwoven with plots throughout.  The characters of Neil and Rashik are also fun to watch and while it does take a while to get from one sequence of the story to the next and back again, the fight scenes are NOT long. It isn't Lawrence of Arabia but Cross and Weller, as well as other members of the cast are excellent at bringing their characters to life--with only ONE exception and that was Ione Skye. I feel that she was either overly dramatic in some scenes or not convincing in others. I will say this though, it is revealed that Diane wants to find the tower simply to reunite with her father.The real beauty of this film lies with the convincing performances of Cross and Weller. They have a gift for making these two brothers real and believable and the scenes between the two were outstanding. If you are a fan of either actor, you should have this in your collection. I can say this, you will somewhat empathize with Cross's character, even though he is portraying a villain here. In the scene where he is talking to Diane (Ione Skye)--the pain Michael reveals of losing her mother to his own brother is both convincing and moving. It also helps one to understand that rage and despair that burn within him, and it is done without trying to justify Michael's actions or to give him some sort of absolution in the eye of the viewer. Cross knows how to master these types of villains very well.I thought the sets and costumes were rich in color and did not appear to be ""low budget"" or polyester as others claim. If you want an intelligent, old fashioned movie with real acting in it, then get this. Just overlook Skye when she does her overkill...",5,"Despite other reviews, this movie is worh a look!
