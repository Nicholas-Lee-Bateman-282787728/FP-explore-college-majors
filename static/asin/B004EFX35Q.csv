Tara guides us gracefully through a variety of yoga poses, focused to build strenght, balance, stretch, lengthening (and SWEAT - A LOT!), etc. I agree it's not for beginners, and if you don't exercise regularly, I would recommend you to start with the DVD set &#34;This is Yoga&#34; (or just buy &#34;Tara Stiles This is Yoga DVD 2: Beginners Yoga for Everyone&#34;). But if you like Tara Stiles' approach to yoga, you will enjoy this flow (it has some variations from Tara's usual series). You will have a great workout, while you release tension at the same time.",5,Yoga + Workout!

1398093,A3IT1LRJSFL1QZ,B004EFX35Q,"Amanda S. ""ALS""","[23, 23]","I was so pleased when I scanned this DVD last night to see the poses Tara uses. I did the DVD this morning and it was fantastic. The routine is not as strenuous as her other DVD, which I find to be very difficult. This one is much more my style. The DVD is about 57 minutes long. It is a perfect balance between stretching, relaxation, balance, and strength. Tara uses a few more traditional poses such as triangle and child's pose. I'm pleased that there were more times to refresh and rejuvenate throughout the routine though child's pose, standing and stretching arms over head, upward dog, etc. I think this DVD is the best yoga routine I've done in a very very long time. I will be doing this more often.The music was nice, too. Very soft and did not over power her. The camera work was great and Tara's instructions, as always, as clear and easy to follow - I did not find the need to keep looking at the screen to see what she was doing. Her instruction is top quality and she always reminds you to go where you can.Finally, this is what I've been looking for.",5,Very accessable for all levels,1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,1067,"['was', 'so', 'pleased', 'when', 'scanned', 'DVD', 'last', 'night', 'see', 'poses', 'Tara', 'did', 'DVD', 'morning', 'was', 'fantastic', 'routine', 'not', 'as', 'strenuous', 'other', 'DVD', 'find', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'one', 'much', 'more', 'style', 'DVD', '57', 'minutes', 'long', 'perfect', 'balance', 'stretching', 'relaxation', 'balance', 'strength', 'Tara', 'few', 'more', 'traditional', 'poses', 'such', 'triangle', 'child', 'pose', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'were', 'more', 'times', 'refresh', 'rejuvenate', 'routine', 'child', 'pose', 'standing', 'stretching', 'arms', 'head', 'upward', 'dog', 'etc', 'think', 'DVD', 'best', 'yoga', 'routine', ""'ve"", 'done', 'very', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'doing', 'more', 'often.The', 'music', 'was', 'nice', 'too', 'Very', 'soft', 'did', 'not', 'power', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'great', 'Tara', 'instructions', 'always', 'clear', 'easy', 'follow', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'need', 'keep', 'looking', 'screen', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'instruction', 'top', 'quality', 'always', 'go', 'where', 'can.Finally', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looking']",Jane Fonda's Workout: Daily Yoga with Tara Stiles

I bought this fairly yearly on in my &#34;practice&#34; and found it difficult, but as time wears on it has become a regular in the rotation.

1398096,A3JGIMBV5KO34M,B004EFX35Q,"Thoughtful ""Thoughtful""","[9, 10]","This is about 55 minutes of actual yoga practices.  I own about 200 exercise videos and did not find it super hard but parts of it were challenging.  I did it for the first time yesterday and wanted to write the review while fresh on my mind.It has the following basic yoga poses that I can recall: warrior 1 and 2 and 3, chair, downward dog, upward dog, plank, several twists, eagle, boat, dolphin, soulder stands, lunges, bridge, plow, wheel, bound angle pose, wide legged seated forward bend, standing forward bend, mountain, pigeon, and tree.  It does not have crow or camel.As one reviewer pointed out it does have the instructor say a lot whatever you want but that did not bother me.  I do like that she is actually doing the video as she talks so she is with you rather than providing instruction with a voiceover clip which is sometimes difficult to match exactly with the movements.  She is doing the video with you one on one.  There are no other students or participants to watch but her.  The setting is very simple and non-distracting and I don't remember noticing any distracting background music.Some of the most challenging postures I remember were one where you have a variation off pigeon and you grab your back leg with your elbow and wrap both arms around it.  Also there is a sequence where you do lunges and come to stand with your leg up and then back down to lunges without using your hands which I found harder than some of the other poses.So bottom line: good video.  Pros:  easy to follow, good instructor, not super new-agey or mystical, poses challenging but not ridiculous, good price.  Cons:  no chapter selections, not quite as much sweating or increased heart rate as some other yoga videos I have, no other instructors or participants to show modifications.I do recommend and think you will enjoy.  I hope this review helps you.",4,I liked it!
