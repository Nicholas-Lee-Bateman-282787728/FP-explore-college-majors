On this DVD,you'll see Puckett with a new ""Union Gap"" rocking live with his six Top 20 hits WOMAN WOMAN,YOUNG GIRL,LADY WILLPOWER,DON'T GIVE IN TO HIM,OVER YOU,THIS GIRL IS A WOMAN NOW and others. GP&TUG put out five Columbia Records albums between 1967 and '70,including GARY PUCKETT & THE UNION GAP'S GREATEST HITS(the '70 release) which features one or two original tracks. Then,Puckett went solo and also re-recorded the band's hits several times which were identical to the original recordings.

Chan,"[1, 1]",gary puckett is a great singer with great songs. i've liked this performance but i wish he sang it more like in his 1960's style. he could of talked less too. it takes away from the music. music should never be interrupted. i hope columbia will release gary puckett & the union gap in concert during their peak. enjoy.,4,the 1960's,1226620800,"11 14, 2008",2008,318,"['gary', 'puckett', 'great', 'singer', 'great', 'songs', 'i', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'performance', 'i', 'wish', 'sang', 'more', '1960', 'style', 'could', 'talked', 'less', 'too', 'away', 'music', 'music', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'interrupted', 'i', 'hope', 'columbia', 'will', 'release', 'gary', 'puckett', 'union', 'gap', 'concert', 'peak', 'enjoy']",N/A

At times he's even a bit off key.It's not just a matter of aging.  I have CDs he has done in recent years and have heard him in concert, so I know he can sound even better than he did during his hit making years.  It's just a shame they didn't record him in concert another night.Gary Puckett is one of my favorite singers, but I found this DVD unlistenable.",1,Gary had an off night,1146960000,"05 7, 2006",2006,474,"['Sorry', 'Gary', 'Puckett', 'obviously', 'had', 'off', 'night', 'when', 'concert', 'was', 'recorded', 'hardly', 'times', 'even', 'bit', 'key.It', 'not', 'just', 'matter', 'aging', 'have', 'CDs', 'done', 'recent', 'years', 'have', 'heard', 'concert', 'know', 'can', 'sound', 'even', 'better', 'did', 'hit', 'making', 'years', 'just', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'record', 'concert', 'night.Gary', 'Puckett', 'one', 'favorite', 'singers', 'found', 'DVD', 'unlistenable']",N/A

McCaffrey ""sumofan""","[2, 3]","Heck, I hate to be the one to deviate from the prior reviews, but I just did not hear what I expected from a performer I really enjoyed in the past. The ""original"" Gary Puckett, from the Union Gap days, had a great/strong/clear voice. The older Gary has changed his style of singing, and does not ... speaking just for myself ... match what we heard in the Sixties. He mentions, in one of many very good short interviews between songs, that, while Chicago is still enjoying great success, his own career has ""gone in a different direction"" (i.e.: singing at the Holiday Inn). He is obviously a fine gentleman, as deduced from the interviews, but I don't believe I'll watch this DVD again.",3,Awrrrrr ....,1120176000,"07 1, 2005",2005,688,"['Heck', 'hate', 'be', 'one', 'deviate', 'prior', 'reviews', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'hear', 'what', 'expected', 'performer', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'past', 'original', 'Gary', 'Puckett', 'Union', 'Gap', 'days', 'had', 'great/strong/clear', 'voice', 'older', 'Gary', 'changed', 'style', 'singing', 'not', 'speaking', 'just', 'match', 'what', 'heard', 'Sixties', 'one', 'many', 'very', 'good', 'short', 'interviews', 'songs', 'Chicago', 'still', 'enjoying', 'great', 'success', 'own', 'career', 'gone', 'different', 'direction', 'i.e', 'singing', 'Holiday', 'Inn', 'obviously', 'fine', 'gentleman', 'deduced', 'interviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'DVD', 'again']",N/A
