In this film Chuck focuses on his relationship with his on screen love. Norris tries to show a more sensitive side. If you are only expecting nonstop violence you will be disappointed. Here Norris stretches his acting chops and delivers a well developed character who has nightmares and cares about his girlfriend. It is similar to Silent Rage but not as good. The final fight took place mostly in the dark and I couldn't really see what was happening. The fight was brief and I thought it would be longer and more violent. I recommend this film for Norris fans. You'll enjoy it if you are tired of nonstop action and looking for more character development. The film contains many fighting scenes that will keep action fans happy. This may be the only Norris film where Norris has nightmares about his opponent. Rent it if you want to see an action film with a sensitive hero.,3,Chuck shows a sensitive side.,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,983,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'are', 'going', 'watch', 'film', 'have', 'know', 'not', 'only', 'action', 'film', 'Chuck', 'relationship', 'screen', 'love', 'Norris', 'show', 'more', 'sensitive', 'side', 'are', 'only', 'expecting', 'nonstop', 'violence', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Here', 'Norris', 'acting', 'chops', 'delivers', 'well', 'developed', 'character', 'who', 'nightmares', 'cares', 'girlfriend', 'similar', 'Silent', 'Rage', 'not', 'good', 'final', 'fight', 'took', 'place', 'mostly', 'dark', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'fight', 'was', 'brief', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'longer', 'more', 'violent', 'recommend', 'film', 'Norris', 'fans', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'are', 'tired', 'nonstop', 'action', 'looking', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'many', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'will', 'keep', 'action', 'fans', 'happy', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'Norris', 'film', 'where', 'Norris', 'nightmares', 'opponent', 'Rent', 'want', 'see', 'action', 'film', 'sensitive', 'hero']",N/A
695215,A2Z44AN3F2IN61,B000063JDJ,D. K. Stokes,"[2, 3]","I normally like action movies, but this one... Danny O'Brien (Chuck Norris) was nicknamed ""Hero"" when he stopped serial killer Simon Moon, who ended up in a psychiatric facility. Afterwards, he spent some time with a therapist (Brynn Thayer) dealing with the nightmares, and he's now living with her, and they're expecting a child.Simon Moon escapes the hospital and makes his getaway in an ambulance, which he crashes. Everyone wants to think he's dead, but when a woman disappears from a newly renovated theater, O'Brien knows Moon is back, but nobody takes him seriously.Thing is, this could have been a decent movie, but instead, it's just dull. We're supposed to feel for Danny and Kay, and the ""heartwarming"" ending, but we never got to know them beyond Danny's nightmares and discovering that Kay had been his therapist, and that she's reluctant to marry him, but considers the relationship permanent. There's a scene in a restaurant on her birthday that I think was supposed to make us sympathetic, but she ends up looking stupid, and he's so laid-back, he's nearly comatose.I'm not sure what the point of their relationship was in the film--him trying to have a normal life, maybe, but we never see him not having the normal life, and that normal life is never threatened. If Simon Moon had captured or threatened Kay, there might have been a point.And what's the point of making her a therapist? She's a pretty bad one--his nightmares come back, and she just says it doesn't matter because she'd already cured him. Huh? And she's seriously out of touch with her own emotions, not even aware that pregnancy heightens them. And the biggie: a romantic relationship with a patient? Not a good thing.As for the action plot--Simon Moon was a 2-dimensional villain. There's no reason for his actions, beyond ""he's evil."" O'Brien knows immediately whodunit, so there's no mystery or suspense there. He also decides, without any investigating, that Simon Moon is hiding in the theater. There is a search for him, but it's long and nothing at all happens.Maybe my biggest problem was that there was very little action to distract me from the dullness of the plot.",2,"not much heroism, not much terror",1214611200,"06 28, 2008",2008,2163,"['normally', 'action', 'movies', 'one', 'Danny', ""O'Brien"", 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'was', 'nicknamed', 'Hero', 'when', 'stopped', 'serial', 'killer', 'Simon', 'Moon', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'psychiatric', 'facility', 'Afterwards', 'spent', 'time', 'therapist', 'Brynn', 'Thayer', 'dealing', 'nightmares', 'now', 'living', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'child.Simon', 'Moon', 'hospital', 'getaway', 'ambulance', 'Everyone', 'think', 'dead', 'when', 'woman', 'newly', 'renovated', 'theater', ""O'Brien"", 'Moon', 'back', 'nobody', 'seriously.Thing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'decent', 'movie', 'instead', 'just', 'dull', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'feel', 'Danny', 'Kay', 'heartwarming', 'ending', 'never', 'got', 'know', 'Danny', 'nightmares', 'discovering', 'Kay', 'had', 'been', 'therapist', 'reluctant', 'marry', 'relationship', 'permanent', 'scene', 'restaurant', 'birthday', 'think', 'was', 'supposed', 'make', 'sympathetic', 'up', 'looking', 'stupid', 'so', 'laid-back', 'nearly', 'comatose.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'point', 'relationship', 'was', 'film', 'trying', 'have', 'normal', 'life', 'maybe', 'never', 'see', 'not', 'having', 'normal', 'life', 'normal', 'life', 'never', 'threatened', 'Simon', 'Moon', 'had', 'captured', 'threatened', 'Kay', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'point.And', 'what', 'point', 'making', 'therapist', 'pretty', 'bad', 'one', 'nightmares', 'come', 'back', 'just', ""n't"", 'matter', ""'d"", 'already', 'cured', 'Huh', 'seriously', 'touch', 'own', 'emotions', 'not', 'even', 'aware', 'pregnancy', 'biggie', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'patient', 'Not', 'good', 'thing.As', 'action', 'plot', 'Simon', 'Moon', 'was', '2-dimensional', 'villain', 'reason', 'actions', 'evil', ""O'Brien"", 'immediately', 'whodunit', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'there', 'also', 'investigating', 'Simon', 'Moon', 'hiding', 'theater', 'search', 'long', 'nothing', 'happens.Maybe', 'biggest', 'problem', 'was', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'action', 'distract', 'dullness', 'plot']",N/A
695216,AY12DBB0U420B,B000063JDJ,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""Hero and the Terror"" starring Chuck Norris. I found it in the five-dollar bin at a nearby Wal-Mart. I've seen a couple Chuck Norris movies in the past and I enjoyed them. This one was acceptable, but didn't mark up to the others. Well, perhaps this action hero needed a bit of a rest.The movie had Norris experiencing some really bad recurring dreams as an aftermath of a near-death experience with a mad man. He was being treated by a shrink, and she was his wife. How's that for a twist? And his wife was well along in a pregnancy. Complicated enough? Well, the mad man returned and deaths and mysterious disappearings began to be associated with a newly renovated civic theater that was about to be reopened. It seems the mad man was possibly living in the catacombs of the theater and it became to task of Norris to flush him out and apprehend him. It was a difficult and complicated task, but our hero was ultimately up to it.The story is not particularly compelling. There's a lot of action and gunfire and mayhem. Well, what might you expect in a Chuck Norris movie? Actually, one of the better side stories in the movie was the pregnancy of his beautiful wife. Go figure. In a Chuck Norris movie? Well, it wasn't a bad movie. I'd rate it about 3 1/2, but I have no way of giving that so I'll raise it to four stars.Gary Peterson",4,Recurring Dreams. Mad Man. Pregnant Wife.
