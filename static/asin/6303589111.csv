I STILL love it and all the banter between the twobrothers by James Caan and Joseph Bologna.  Marsha Mason's portrayal of Jenny was heart-felt and realistic especially for the scene where she stands up for herself as James Caan's character prepares to leave.  Valerie Harper was enjoyable as best friend to Jenny.  The scenes of their honeymoon were actually filmed in Bermuda not the West Indies as James Caan's character gave directions to the cab driver taking them to the airport.  I lived in Bermuda for many wonderful years, and it was filmed beautifully and true.

James Caan is great--low key, repressing his emotions, stoic. Marsha Mason is good too--her speech at the end about how she is nuts about herself should be required viewing for every female with self-esteem issues. Joseph Bologna is fantastic--funny, sarcastic, believable. The only character I didn't like was Valerie Harper--too thin and her hair looked extremely weird--like she'd soaked it in water and then let it floof out to a strange texture and color.

I'm in the processe of writing five books simultaneously, which I'm finding quite a joyful event.I purposely looked up when this movie was made because it has remained a wonderfful adventure of love's second time around.  I also married twice and found that the second time holds a higher appreciation of emotions but on the flip side of the coin, it also comes with a price.  I was amazed at seeing this movie again after so many years, to find that the romance I remembered was now a little more shallow in the beginning, and  lasted through many twists and turns, to come out so rewarding to see that it is possible to fall in love again, if you can find that person who compliments your depth of learning about your rights and wrongs in a relationship.  We each have that common scale we build as we travel through life.What brought me to review Marsha Mason was her appearance on the Frazier citcoms that I watch every night for a half hour or so, so enable me to calm down and turn the busy world of today, so I can go to sleeps each night with a light heart and open to good dreams.So I truly recommend this book for all ages, 12 and up, as an advance possibility of love to look forward to, or toward the end of our adventureous life on earth, to see is we were forunately blessed with any kind of love like this, in our travels.I can truly say, my second marriage I had it all at one time in my life.  If I never marry again, which GOD has left me single for over 32 years now, at at least had it once... which I have found throughout the years, allot of people never find it once.  That's sad to my heart.Hopefully, this review will give you a desire to seek out this movie, it's really worth it... wholesome, real, relative.Have a blessed day!Susie 311",5,Review a Movie I First Saw 25 Years Ago,1321142400,"11 13, 2011",2011,1822,"['Now', 'age', '68', 'have', 'time', 'reflect', 'past', ""'m"", 'processe', 'writing', 'five', 'books', 'simultaneously', ""'m"", 'finding', 'quite', 'joyful', 'event.I', 'purposely', 'looked', 'up', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'remained', 'wonderfful', 'adventure', 'love', 'second', 'time', 'also', 'married', 'twice', 'found', 'second', 'time', 'higher', 'appreciation', 'emotions', 'flip', 'side', 'coin', 'also', 'price', 'was', 'amazed', 'seeing', 'movie', 'again', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'find', 'romance', 'remembered', 'was', 'now', 'little', 'more', 'shallow', 'beginning', 'lasted', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'come', 'out', 'so', 'rewarding', 'see', 'possible', 'fall', 'love', 'again', 'can', 'find', 'person', 'who', 'depth', 'learning', 'rights', 'wrongs', 'relationship', 'have', 'common', 'scale', 'build', 'travel', 'life.What', 'brought', 'review', 'Marsha', 'Mason', 'was', 'appearance', 'Frazier', 'citcoms', 'watch', 'night', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'enable', 'calm', 'down', 'turn', 'busy', 'world', 'today', 'can', 'go', 'sleeps', 'night', 'light', 'heart', 'open', 'good', 'dreams.So', 'truly', 'recommend', 'book', 'ages', '12', 'up', 'advance', 'possibility', 'love', 'look', 'forward', 'end', 'adventureous', 'life', 'earth', 'see', 'were', 'forunately', 'blessed', 'kind', 'love', 'travels.I', 'can', 'truly', 'say', 'second', 'marriage', 'had', 'one', 'time', 'life', 'never', 'marry', 'again', 'GOD', 'left', 'single', '32', 'years', 'now', 'least', 'had', 'once', 'have', 'found', 'years', 'allot', 'people', 'never', 'find', 'once', 'sad', 'heart.Hopefully', 'review', 'will', 'give', 'desire', 'seek', 'out', 'movie', 'really', 'worth', 'wholesome', 'real', 'relative.Have', 'blessed', 'day', 'Susie', '311']",Chapter Two VHS
