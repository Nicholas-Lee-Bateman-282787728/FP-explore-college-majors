It goes further though, throwing in witches, werewolves and some early Peter Jackson style jokes and gore. A great movie to watch as a group and have some laughs and thrills with. Strong direction, awesome cinematography and a sense of macabre humour make this well worth the purchase.",4,"Sick, gory, funny and enjoyable.",1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,398,"['glorious', 'tradition', 'Street', 'Trash', 'get', 'independent', 'take', 'cursed', 'booze', 'effects', 'heavy', 'genre', 'further', 'throwing', 'witches', 'werewolves', 'early', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'style', 'jokes', 'gore', 'great', 'movie', 'watch', 'group', 'have', 'laughs', 'thrills', 'Strong', 'direction', 'awesome', 'cinematography', 'sense', 'macabre', 'humour', 'make', 'well', 'purchase']",Witch's Brew

And lo and behold, it's just as good as President's Day. Maybe even better. It's a gorefest with a huge bodycount. It's also got some nudity (courtesy of Ruby Larocca and a hot black chick), and a lot of laughs.

1610678,A12TX9927X2TE0,B00AHTYGEU,Claudia Horton,"[1, 1]",My purchase of this movie Witch's Brew was good.  I would say it was different and not the norm that you would think in a movie like this.  I'm sure it's a B movie but kept my interest.  There was not a dull moment in the movie and that's what I enjoyed most about it.  It's hard to hold my attention and even though it's not a top rate movie it was interesting and enjoyable.,4,Witch's Brew,1397174400,"04 11, 2014",2014,376,"['purchase', 'movie', 'Witch', 'Brew', 'was', 'good', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'different', 'not', 'norm', 'would', 'think', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'B', 'movie', 'kept', 'interest', 'was', 'not', 'dull', 'moment', 'movie', 'what', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'hard', 'hold', 'attention', 'even', 'not', 'top', 'rate', 'movie', 'was', 'interesting', 'enjoyable']",Witch's Brew

Horrible things happen to those who drink the beer normally involving Troma style effects.  That's pretty much it.This is a low budget film that had some good special effects and make-up as well as very &#34;B&#34; effects and bad rubber masks. The humor was at the low end. For instance a vet in a wheel chair is named &#34;Mr. Walker&#34; who &#34;doesn't stand for a lot of things.&#34;The film is cheesy, the humor corny, and the special effects questionable.
