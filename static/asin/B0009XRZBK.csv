916255,A26IPZJ4OA05RU,B0009XRZBK,Food Fan,"[46, 48]","I like how she clearly calls out each movement so that there is no guessing about when to bend my legs, etc.  I like how the overall tone of the dvd feels very calm and not rushed (the music and scenery are relaxing) WITHOUT the video feeling slow or boring; I think she accomplishes this by moving from one exercise to the next without downtime, so I don't feel like I'm wasting time (this is in contrast to the Windsor Pilates ""Basics set"", which spends a very boring amount of time talking about each move instead of just showing or doing the move. The Windsor would be good for absolute beginners who want a detailed How-To tutorial).  Anyways, She managed to get through a suprising number of different moves in half an hour, so I felt like I had decent abs/leg adductors workout from it (but keep in mind Pilates is low impact, so it's not going to make you sweat as much as aerobics).Also, on the same disc users have the option verbal cues in SPANISH.UPDATE:  Since I wrote my initial review, I have tried at least 10 other company's pilates workout, and I would say Ana Caban's is still one of my favorites. She goes through a variety of moves but doesn't feel rushed, she cues well but doesn't talk talk too much, and the background is beautiful.",5,Recommended for beginners to intermediate.,1158883200,"09 22, 2006",2006,1256,"['like', 'how', 'clearly', 'out', 'movement', 'so', 'guessing', 'about', 'when', 'bend', 'legs', 'etc', 'how', 'overall', 'tone', 'dvd', 'feels', 'very', 'calm', 'not', 'rushed', 'music', 'scenery', 'are', 'relaxing', 'video', 'feeling', 'slow', 'boring', 'think', 'moving', 'one', 'exercise', 'next', 'downtime', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'m"", 'wasting', 'time', 'contrast', 'Windsor', 'Pilates', 'Basics', 'set', 'very', 'boring', 'amount', 'time', 'talking', 'move', 'instead', 'just', 'showing', 'doing', 'move', 'Windsor', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'absolute', 'beginners', 'who', 'want', 'detailed', 'How-To', 'tutorial', 'Anyways', 'managed', 'get', 'suprising', 'number', 'different', 'moves', 'hour', 'felt', 'had', 'decent', 'abs/leg', 'adductors', 'keep', 'mind', 'Pilates', 'low', 'impact', 'not', 'going', 'make', 'sweat', 'as', 'much', 'aerobics', '.Also', 'same', 'disc', 'users', 'have', 'option', 'verbal', 'cues', 'SPANISH.UPDATE', 'wrote', 'initial', 'review', 'have', 'tried', 'least', '10', 'other', 'company', 'pilates', 'would', 'say', 'Ana', 'Caban', 'still', 'one', 'favorites', 'variety', 'moves', ""n't"", 'feel', 'rushed', 'well', ""n't"", 'talk', 'talk', 'too', 'much', 'background', 'beautiful']",Quick Start Pilates for Weight Loss

It has a great variety of pilates poses and it is very beautifully produced.  Ana looks so nice and fit and the location on Malibu beach is a calming choice for backdrop.  I'm glad that Ana slowed the pace down a bit in this workout-it gives me a chance to improve my form and I can really feel my muscles toning and strengthening while I hold each pose!  And I like that the workout only requires 30 minutes of my time.  The ironic thing is that I didn't even buy this for weight loss-I just wanted a good, slower-paced pilates workout.",5,Very nice!,1132876800,"11 25, 2005",2005,677,"['details', 'workout', 'already', 'been', 'wonderfully', 'described', 'previous', 'reviewer', ""'ll"", 'just', 'add', 'think', 'very', 'nice', 'great', 'variety', 'pilates', 'poses', 'very', 'beautifully', 'produced', 'Ana', 'so', 'nice', 'fit', 'location', 'Malibu', 'beach', 'calming', 'choice', 'backdrop', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Ana', 'slowed', 'pace', 'down', 'bit', 'workout-it', 'chance', 'improve', 'form', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'muscles', 'toning', 'strengthening', 'hold', 'pose', 'like', 'workout', 'only', '30', 'minutes', 'time', 'ironic', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'buy', 'weight', 'loss-I', 'just', 'wanted', 'good', 'slower-paced', 'pilates']",Quick Start Pilates for Weight Loss

In addition, she included the Swan, one of my absolute favorite Pilates moves. I just wish the move could have been a little longer, though. This DVD is great for anyone generally new to Pilates. The one thing I was worried about though was the long table on which she worked out too. The setting itself was beautiful on a beach, but Ana was working on top of a table, and at times I was worried that something was going to happen to her. Luckily, nothing did. This workout worked out everything to me-the core, the legs, even the arms. I so can't wait to get her other new DVDs, coming out next month on Oct.4.",5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this workout!!!,1125532800,"09 1, 2005",2005,727,"['Finally', 'Ana', 'back', 'whole', 'new', 'Pilates', 'definitely', 'how', 'pack', 'wallop', 'just', '30', 'minutes', 'addition', 'included', 'Swan', 'one', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'Pilates', 'moves', 'just', 'wish', 'move', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'longer', 'though', 'DVD', 'great', 'anyone', 'generally', 'new', 'Pilates', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'worried', 'though', 'was', 'long', 'table', 'worked', 'out', 'too', 'setting', 'was', 'beautiful', 'beach', 'Ana', 'was', 'working', 'top', 'table', 'times', 'was', 'worried', 'something', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'Luckily', 'nothing', 'did', 'workout', 'worked', 'out', 'everything', 'me-the', 'core', 'legs', 'even', 'arms', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'other', 'new', 'DVDs', 'coming', 'out', 'next', 'month', 'Oct.4']",Quick Start Pilates for Weight Loss

Ana Caban guides you through a number of familiar Pilates exercises including the hundred, roll-ups, leg circles, rolling like a ball and the teaser. The serene-by-the-sea setting is relaxing as Ana Caban works out in a pink outfit on a sapphire mat on a platform above the waves. This energetic workout is perfect if you only have a half hour to exercise and want to boost your metabolism.
