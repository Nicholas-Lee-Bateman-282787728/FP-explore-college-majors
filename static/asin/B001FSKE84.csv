Her television series  is so funny and I am proud to say I own them , but I became sad when I learned it was going off the air. There wasnt a character that could not have been on the show, without them all it was not the same. I feel that Reba did a great job raising her children as a single parent, or atleast she did the best she could. I think us moms always feel that way or atleast I do. I did the best I could with what I had. I loved Joanna Garcia and looking for other stuff she has done. Reba gives such great performances on stage whether she is singing or acting.
