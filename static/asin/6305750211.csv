Some stories are LARGER than a low-budget film will adequately handle, but not for the talent.  The talent was superlative.

475484,A1VRDWPTPK78T8,6305750211,Bryan M. MCNEELY,"[0, 0]","This movie could have easily been written off as just another ""feel bad for teens"" flick, though I believe since only a small portion of the film takes place within school property, a different focus is put on the main characters than the simple angst-ridden garden variety.""A Better Place"" treads new ground in its focus on the scales of justice and the human response to personal trauma. Sparing the plot (because it doesn't really matter AND it's been said over and over throughout many reviews here), the general idea of the film is that though two people can share similar experiences, they won't necessarily grow from them similarly. Interpretation and what one takes from life's unfortunate circumstances are as varied as the clothes people can wear. In the case of our ""heroes,"" Barret and Ryan, they may have become friends via a similar stroke of bad luck, their outlook on life in its basic form couldn't be any more different. Thus begins the ultimate conflict of the film.The main driving point that the movie makes is that when you experience hardship in any form, either you learn from it, pick yourself up and move on with life with a better understanding of how to handle stress...or you allow it to bubble inside yourself; eventually letting it bring you to the point of desperation. ""A Better Place"" is philosophical, psychological and very, very simple as well. ..simply put, ""a better place"" may not be a literal reference to a location on a map where one may run to when looking to escape the torments of home or one's history.It may be locked away deep in the mind or the heart.

475485,A3J5UO5QMTFSWB,6305750211,"Connoisseur Rat ""armchair experientialist""","[4, 5]","Well, you know you're in for a low-budget movie experience when one of the opening credits reads ""Camera: Ian Dudley"" (as it does in this movie). And that's not meant to be a knock against Ian Dudley: it's just that it says ""camera"".  Singular.  As in one.Fortunately, in my world, low budget does not equal low quality.  In fact, I often find it to be just the opposite: the constraints and restrictions forced upon filmmakers by a lack of financing can lead to more creative ways of approaching things which might not have occurred otherwise.  And though I think that occasionally happened with the movie ""A Better Place,"" this $40,000 flick ultimately falls just a little bit short of greatness (though more because of its writing than its lack of budget).The movie begins with a voiceover spoken by the charmingly earnest high school senior Barret (Robert DiPatri, who resembles a younger, much more sincere Ed Helms), after he and his mom relocate following the death of his father: ""We came here to start over - a new life in a better place.  We should've stayed behind.""So right away, you know things aren't going to go particularly well.  And boy don't they!  After a particularly miserable (and shakily filmed) first day at his new school (at times giving new meaning to the phrase ""lack of focus in the classroom""), Barret befriends local outcast Ryan (Eion Bailey), who is considerably less charming than Barret.  Ryan is, in fact, so aggressively misanthropic that he favors nothing less than the catastrophic extinction of the species.  Not so charming at all!  And it isn't long before you realize why Barret might just have been better off had he, in fact, stayed behind.The phrase ""a better place"" actually appears in two key scenes in the movie: at the beginning (as quoted above) and in a pivotal (and ironic) scene in Ryan's bedroom, where he and Barret discuss the finer points of Sartre: ""The way Sartre see it, if people would just accept responsibility for their actions...the world just might be a better place,"" says Ryan.  But when Barret asks, ""So, do you accept responsibility for all your actions?"" Ryan just kind of laughs and says, ""Yeah - most of the time.""Not too much later, when we see how Ryan handles an unfortunate occurrence in the woods (""we can make this look like an accident""), we realize that Ryan is like many teens who can absorb ideas conceptually but can't yet put them into practice experientially.  This turns out to have some major repercussions down the road.This film is rich with ideas and a serious, oftentimes foreboding tone - it gets a little River's Edgy at times.  Its talkiness, I feel, owes more to films in the Richard Linklater canon like ""Waking Life"" than it does to Kevin Smith's usual View Askew/Clerks fare.  It's got a hauntingly, hypnotically effective mostly-electronic soundtrack, and Ian Dudley usually does a good job with that one camera.Where the movie falls a little short for me is that the generally-solid acting gets a bit amateurish at times, and the dialog a bit too writerly and not entirely natural-sounding in spots.  Now, it's true that great acting can occasionally overcome stilted dialog, and that great dialog can often inspire actors to transcend their limitations.  Here, however, the confluence of uncertain acting and writing sometimes makes some of the scenes ring a bit false.  Plus, one aspect of the ending also seemed a bit forced, as I feel there might have been more plausible ways of getting the three characters to the same place at the end.With all of that being said, however... this DVD is a gem.  It's absolutely crammed with extras, most of them as interesting as the film itself.  The three introductions with Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier are hilarious, there are 8 deleted scenes (both with and without commentary), a comparison of the film's original mono mix with the remixed sound done at Skywalker Ranch, and not one, but two feature commentaries with writer/director Vin Pereira and cast members Brain Lynch (Eddie), Joseph Cassese (Todd) and Rob DiPatri.  The first commentary is a bit annoying, as we hear for ourselves why Pereira has the reputation for talking too much (A fun challenge: see if you can identify the very few moments when he lets one of the others say more than two sentences in a row!)But the second, ""ultra-secret"" hidden Easter Egg bonus drunken commentary is a riot.  It is here where you will learn that Brian Lynch is, indeed, the funniest man alive.  Also, learn amazing things about topics such as (but not limited to): Toothless Joe's ""shaved teeth"" (the style at the time), Ben ""I was in Armageddon"" Affleck's future prophetic nickname, and Eion Bailey's gay filmmaking choices.  Plus, did they really kill that horseshoe crab?  All that, and guest cameos from ""George Lazenby"" and Silent Bob!Thus, while I give the movie itself three stars, the feature-packed DVD is worthy of nothing less than five, making my overall rating four stars.

475487,A2XYSGN7ULK39H,6305750211,h3adlin3,"[3, 3]","As a long time fan of Kevin Smith's work, I was always curious as to who the heck was Vincent Pereira? Now I know, he is one hell of a writer/film maker! ""A Better Place"" struck home on many chords with me. Vincent has artfully captured the fellings of angst and isolation that I so often felt in High School. He shows the sort of things that go on that parents and teachers either didn't know about, or didn't want to know about. Things that always caused my jaw to drop in disbelief when an adult would refer to my time in school as ""The best years of your life!"" You mean it gets worse? (A quick word of reassurance to those of you still in school, don't worry, for the most part it gets better.) Things like being picked on for no apparent reason, getting hasseled, if not actually beaten up, again for little or no apparent reason. Getting mocked, derided, and put upon, for who you are, or how you look, or who you choose to be friends with. ""A Better Place"" is somewhat like ""The Breakfast Club"", but without the Hollywood fantasy of problems being solved in a good happy way, and boy getting the girl, and all that (stuff).The Movie:I don't want to give too much away, suffice to say Barret Michaelson(Robert DiPatri-excellent job) has a rough time at his first day in a new school, falls in with loner Ryan Walker(Eion Bailey-another excelent perfomance, this guy has future STAR writen all over him) and although they share much in common, it soon becomes apparent that Ryan is walking a darker path. His talks of (...), soon turn to rants of sterilization, and genocide. And the longer Barret knows him the more deeply he becomes entwined in his life. Barret becomes Ryan's only connection to a world gone bad, his relief valve, someone he can share his thoughts and ideas with, without fear of (too harsh a) judgement. Barret becomes his anchor, and when Barret fimally begins to make other friends, Ryan finds(sets) himself cast adrift, alone with his own dark thoughts, no way to get them out of his system. Things just get uglier from there.The Extras:Lots of outtakes, outtakes with commentary, film commentary with Vince and others, old sound to new sound comparisons, and three(count 'em three) intros by Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier(which in all honesty are out of place in this movie, it's hard to justify their yucking it up with the tone of the film, I love these guys, but they could've been a little more serious for this one.)The Look:Yes it's low budget, yes some scenes are lower quality, or even blurry, but the writing is dead on, and the acting so good as to put a number of so called ACTORS to shame. Vincent talks about a few more cuts he would've liked to make, and I'd agree with him, but as a whole the movie is well shot, framed, acted, edited, and writen.Vincent doesn't offer up any pat answers for his characters' behaviors, although he does give us a look at their family life(or lack thereof), as a way of giving us an idea of how these kids became who they are. Justifiably so. At some point you have to be responsible for your actions, but how you are raised goes a long way to how you behave and act towards others.

475488,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,6305750211,Michael Crane,"[13, 13]","&quot;A Better Place"" is a disturbing and unsettling look at teen violence.  This is a film that is so raw and brutal that it literally shakes you when you're not expecting it.  Be warned, this is not a film to watch if you're looking for something to enjoy.  This is as harsh and intense as it gets.The movie tells the story of Barret Michaelson; the new kid in town.  The first day at his new school he is picked on by almost everybody.  He makes friends with Ryan; an isolated loaner who doesn't particularly like people in general.  As time passes by, Ryan drags Barret further and further into his worldview of hate and darkness.  It isn't long before things become violent and dangerous, leading to an unbelievably shocking and cruel finale.It's hard to believe that this movie came from View Askew.  Who would've thought they could've come out with something so intense and dark?  As disturbing and chilling it is, it's an honest movie.  It's not a glamorous film, and it's not trying to be one.  That's why it's so effective.  It has a raw and brutal feel to it all, and that's what makes it so powerful.I thought the movie was very well-written and directed.  I kind of felt that it could've been longer and that Ryan's character could've been expanded more.  But for the most part, it's a very good movie.  It reminds me of ""Bully,"" except ""A Better Place"" is much more ""slice-of-life"" resembling.  It's effective because it doesn't feel like a movie, but more like something that is actually happening.The DVD has some special features, such as commentary, deleted scenes and more.  There are some really cool Easter Eggs if you can find them.  (Look at some of the other reviews, and you will find them.)""A Better Place"" is a shocking and unrelenting film that is as honest as it is disturbing.  Not too many movies like this are out there.  It may be a low budget movie, but the overall product is nothing low, I assure you.  Be warned, this is a very uneasy movie to watch.

I first saw this film about ten years ago on IFC, and it really stuck with me. I was kind of young, so as time went on it slipped my mind, until I was browsing around the View Askew web store and saw they had it for sale. Instantly it brought me back to when I first watched it. It's a really powerful movie, and even brutal at times. So I had to come to Amazon and order it.It's a dramatic independent film that takes an entirely new look at high school violence and person's life in that environment.

475493,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,6305750211,wellwellwell,"[0, 2]","Kevin Smith, who by now is past the 28-grand-a-movie budget, has turned away from the big lights of Hollywood to direct yet another ""indie"" film (this time for a mere $40,000).  `A Better Place' stars two no-name actors, Eion Bailey and Robert DiPatri.  With the two no-namers, the movie is set up a lot like `Clerks' was.  But this movie is far from a comedy.  Bailey and DiPatri star as lost, but opinionated loner kids who, after a first day of high school, become friends.  Although both are secluded and/or cut-off from the rest of the world, both share many stories and beliefs with each other.  Whether it be on their everyday problems or their views on life itself.And that's where the trouble begins.  It's very clear from the start that Bailey does not like people.  In fact, he hates people.  To make a long story short, he and his friend end up in many situations that involve the very irritable subject of teenage violence.  Whether it be your average fistfight or death.  The storyline is good and for the most part original.  Smith does a great job with a small, unheard-of cast, and even manages to slip in two of his regulars: Jason Lee and Ethan Suplee.  And both brighten up the film just that much, even if their parts are rather small. And, to make this movie seem even more appealing, you'll find it at #9 or so on my listmania list, Move endings you WON'T see coming.  Hmmm...In giving this movie 3.25 stars I'm going out on a [short] limb. You may like this movie. and on the other hand you may absolutely hate it.  Some parts are a bit disturbing, but that's life.  And if you have any sense of reality in you, which most people don't; as they are left with more of an idealistic-everything's-gonna-be-fine perception, then you'll find this movie to be a pleasant surprise. Or an ""underground classic"", as many people like to call them.  I compliment Kevin Smith, along with the entire cast of actors and actresses for this movie.
