Oh hang on I think it might have experimented, once. It's eyesexual.THE PLOT: Endless dumb scenes of the two gays, err guys, in bed together in just their underwear isn't my idea of entertainment.This made my eye uncomfortable; the film maker shouldn't confuse horror with homo. Oh, but there was no horror either.Punctuated by unstopping slo mo soft sex scenes with really bad pornograpohy, err photography, this film is only surpassed by porn flicks. But the scenes served their purpose: to make it three times longer. The film.It's so one-eyed, this film.No wonder the HUGE EYE popped out that young gay's head and bulged into some monstrous sex object. This one-eyed monster was more like another ball, not an eyeball. Yes his inner eye became his outer eye some 500 times engorged. But instead of being the Enlightened Giant from beyond it could have been, it was a pissweak pipsqueak that just stood there motionless most the time, staring into vacant space. It must have been blind; it never stopped it. So the cock-eyed thing floats around on its tendril perving on chicks, and feeling them up. What a nerve. The optical effects are a green plasma lamp - a disc one - superimposed in the pupil of the giant plastic. Furtherless, the chicks with stalks don't realise it's a monster. At least if the eye hypnotised them and even instantly, that would be the film's one suspension of disbelievable bit.If this film was aware, there might be plenty of opps for sight gags, and wit. For different situations. But there aren't any situations. Devoid of not just vision, but all senses, this film has no hearing, taste, smell, or touch.How anyone can see anything in this film is beyond dimension. It was cornea as hell.The director is blind. Probly a cyclops, judging by his vision. Oh but that means giant, not one-eyed, though he was certainly that. I could only watch the entire film with one eye.He's got about 12 different names as director. He must be ashamed of himself.Keep an eye out for this film.I could never see this film again, unless I was blind.

Distracted by his unreasonably hot and somehow under-sexed wife Rita (ex-adult film star Jacqueline Lovell), our scientist fails to notice when his test subject dies and his eye mutates to monstrous size and then crawls away.This was not one of Full Moon's stronger releases.  It felt like more attention went into the production of the sex scenes than into the special effects of the killer eye monster.  In fact, this is demonstrative of the worst monster effects I've seen from a Full Moon release in a long time.  The monster looks like a giant plastic eye with rubber guts.  Even when the monstrous eye &#34;abducts&#34; Rita the scene feels stolen from some cheap porno--down to the overtly redundant shots and lame music.  Even the acting and sets seemed cheap&#8230;cheap even for a nudity-rich Full Moon movie!Like with most adult films, this cheap T'n'A horror flick clocks in at 72 minutes, most of the running time of which was dedicated to sex scenes.  This movie legitimately comes off as if they were trying to make horror porn and then cut out the hardcore stuff.  This eye really gets around, by the way.  It takes advantage of Rita while she's asleep and then it eye laser-roofies some chick in the shower and has its way with her.  It doesn't help the porn-vibe that Rita tries to have sex with every man she encounters.  Oh, no, but that's not all.  This giant pervy eyeball monster then uses its eye laser to control the mind of its last victim's husband to make him watch and rub his chest while the eye has another go at her, not minutes after the eye shared a shower scene with her!  They may as well have called this movie &#34;Eyegasm.&#34;So then the eye monster somehow reanimates the juvenile delinquent from whose head it sprang to life.  The eye monster uses the boy's body to try to communicate with Rita that it's from another world and needs to procreate.  Being an epic slut, Rita just ignores the quite likely underage kid and tries to have sex with him.This flick wears on until they basically just end it by scaring the eye back to the 8th dimension with a couple of flashlights, leaving the women ominously pregnant in its wake.This was so lame.

Then he begins to go on a spree.  Wow, that's very  scary.Actually, the movie didn't have a plot.  There's only one way  that I can really explain it.  The way it looked, it was about a scientist  trying to experiment on a giant eye.  The experiment goes awry, and the  giant eye escapes.  He goes on a spree of bizarre sex and murder.  It may  seem interesting, but it will not appeal you.  The sex scenes are mindless  and unnecessary.  The murders are implied, which means there were hardly  any scenes of actual violence.The movie has some parts were it is  intended to be funny, but most of the jokes are corny.  They say the  dumbest combination of words in a flat tone, and they expect that to be  funny.  How many people would laugh once through the movie?  I know I  didn't.  If you're looking for something funny, definitely do not try this  one.Last of all, the movie had the worst actors and the worst  script.  I don't know where they got the cast from, but they sure made a  big mistake.  Lovell  and the other actors are the worst actors that I ever  saw.  They have no emotion to their voice, and they do not know how to tell  jokes.  The script is even worse.  Although I know that Full Moon makes  many bad horror films, but this one was just ridiculous.  Whoever wrote  this script shouldn't write again.  It contained the worst dialogue and the  worst scenery.  This is what you really call low budget.  Most of the  seventy five minutes take place in an apartment building, and most just  takes place in one room.If you want to see something like this one,  I would recommend idle hands.  It is both funny, gory, and sometimes scary.  It was far better then this amateur piece of work.  It contained all the  elements of a good horror comedy.  It had gore, as always, scary encounters  with stalker prey, and of course some jokes.  It also has better acting, a  better script, and better jokes.  Overall, I recommend Idle Hands, but I  definitely don't recommend The Killer Eye.",1,This is one of the worst films that I have ever seen.,966297600,"08 15, 2000",2000,2379,"['When', 'look', 'film', 'think', 'are', 'see', 'scary', 'funny', 'bizarre', 'movie', 'only', 'thing', 'was', 'true', 'was', 'was', 'bizarre', 'Everything', 'was', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'plot', 'was', 'really', 'corny.The', 'title', 'think', 'movie', 'scary', ""n't"", 'true', 'see', 'giant', 'eye', 'coming', 'life', 'Then', 'go', 'spree', 'Wow', 'very', 'scary.Actually', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'plot', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'can', 'really', 'explain', 'way', 'looked', 'was', 'scientist', 'trying', 'experiment', 'giant', 'eye', 'experiment', 'awry', 'giant', 'eye', 'escapes', 'spree', 'bizarre', 'sex', 'murder', 'may', 'seem', 'interesting', 'will', 'not', 'appeal', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'mindless', 'unnecessary', 'murders', 'are', 'implied', 'were', 'hardly', 'scenes', 'actual', 'violence.The', 'movie', 'parts', 'were', 'intended', 'be', 'funny', 'most', 'jokes', 'are', 'corny', 'say', 'dumbest', 'combination', 'words', 'flat', 'tone', 'expect', 'be', 'funny', 'How', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'laugh', 'once', 'movie', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'funny', 'definitely', 'do', 'not', 'try', 'one.Last', 'movie', 'had', 'worst', 'actors', 'worst', 'script', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'got', 'cast', 'sure', 'made', 'big', 'mistake', 'Lovell', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'worst', 'actors', 'ever', 'saw', 'have', 'emotion', 'voice', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'tell', 'jokes', 'script', 'even', 'worse', 'know', 'Full', 'Moon', 'many', 'bad', 'horror', 'films', 'one', 'was', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'Whoever', 'wrote', 'script', 'should', ""n't"", 'write', 'again', 'contained', 'worst', 'dialogue', 'worst', 'scenery', 'what', 'really', 'call', 'low', 'budget', 'Most', 'seventy', 'five', 'minutes', 'take', 'place', 'apartment', 'building', 'most', 'just', 'place', 'one', 'room.If', 'want', 'see', 'something', 'one', 'would', 'recommend', 'idle', 'hands', 'funny', 'gory', 'sometimes', 'scary', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'then', 'amateur', 'piece', 'work', 'contained', 'elements', 'good', 'horror', 'comedy', 'had', 'gore', 'always', 'scary', 'encounters', 'stalker', 'prey', 'course', 'jokes', 'also', 'better', 'acting', 'better', 'script', 'better', 'jokes', 'Overall', 'recommend', 'Idle', 'Hands', 'definitely', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'Killer', 'Eye']",N/A
