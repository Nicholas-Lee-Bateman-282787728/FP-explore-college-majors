He finds a mission, that finds him, while viewing the casualty list of the second Iraq War.  A Lt. Colonel, he volunteers to escort a young marine killed in battle and bring his remains home.  You are on a journey through the heartland of America, where the military has meaning- to serve with honor and to honor the fallen.I compare this picture a little bit to The Deer Hunter, Gardens of Stone, and Schindlers' List (the ending).

1236895,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B001TOD6N4,Amit Talpade,"[1, 1]","A simple story so movingly told. The story is about U.S.Marine Michael Strobl (Kevin Bacon) who escorts the last remains of Private First Class Chance Phelps from the mortuary at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to his home in Wyoming, which also happens to be Strobl's hometown. The movie starts with a black screen and the only audible sound is the radio chatter. This is the death scene of Chance Phelps. The story takes us on a journey through The story takes the viewer into some seldom-seen corners of America -- from airport cargo facilities to the mountain highways of Wyoming -- and shows everywhere the reverence for the fallen. When the escort gives Phelps' watch, dog tags, and wooden cross to his parents, eight days after his death, even men will feel the tears coming. Finally, as Lt Col Strobl (who had not yet been to Operation Iraqi Freedom when he accompanied Phelps' remains home) thinks over the experience, there's a meditation on where duty lies for a Marine Corps officer. Along trip to the destination, Bacon encounters American soul everywhere. From the ticket agent who upgrades him to first class, the cargo handlers who have seen all kinds of cargo, the airline pilot and to the traffic on the street. These scenes are so outstanding in their emotional depth that it would be impossible to feel unmoved. This movie is the result of the meticulous reports that Army escorts are supposed to keep so that their knowledge is useful for future escorts. Strobl volunteers to be an escort because he feels that it is his patriotic duty as he cannot stay on the sidelines while others are fighting.

The film is brilliant in its simplicity:  we see Kevin Bacon's Lt. Col. Mike Strobl - a soldier's soldier shown at the outset to be uncomfortable and guilt-ridden at being 'over here' as fellow soldiers toil 'over there' - look to play some small role in the Iraqi effort by escorting the body of PFC Chance Phelps back to burial in his hometown.The narrative of the movie is the tracing of the path of Phelps' body from its arrival at Dover Air Force Base to the small, rock-ribbed community of Dubois, Wyoming.  The emotion of the film is generated by people's reaction along the way.  It's Bacon's handling of his character's ever-so-slightly wavering stoicism that gets you. He's pitch-perfect here, watching and recording and ultimately relating the effect that Phelps' presence has on witnesses to this final journey.Regardless of political stripe, regardless of your feeling about the Iraq war, If this movie doesn't get to you in a deeply emotive way, you're some type of cyborg.",5,"Brilliant in its simplicity: by design, not much happens in 'Taking Chance'",1244246400,"06 6, 2009",2009,1075,"['mean', 'best', 'possible', 'way', 'not', 'much', 'happens', ""'Taking"", 'Chance', 'design', 'film', 'brilliant', 'simplicity', 'see', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Mike', 'Strobl', 'soldier', 'soldier', 'shown', 'outset', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'guilt-ridden', 'being', ""'over"", 'here', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'toil', 'look', 'play', 'small', 'role', 'Iraqi', 'effort', 'escorting', 'body', 'PFC', 'Chance', 'Phelps', 'back', 'burial', 'hometown.The', 'narrative', 'movie', 'tracing', 'path', 'Phelps', 'body', 'arrival', 'Dover', 'Air', 'Force', 'Base', 'small', 'rock-ribbed', 'community', 'Dubois', 'Wyoming', 'emotion', 'film', 'generated', 'people', 'reaction', 'way', 'Bacon', 'handling', 'character', 'ever-so-slightly', 'wavering', 'stoicism', 'pitch-perfect', 'here', 'watching', 'recording', 'ultimately', 'relating', 'effect', 'Phelps', 'presence', 'witnesses', 'final', 'journey.Regardless', 'political', 'stripe', 'regardless', 'feeling', 'Iraq', 'war', 'movie', ""n't"", 'get', 'deeply', 'emotive', 'way', ""'re"", 'type', 'cyborg']",Taking Chance

But no one forced Chance Phelps to rush off to the recruiter. True enough he was from a broken family with parents most likely glad to not have to pay for his college or post-high school training, but Phelps wanted the Corps. Like so many young men who crave a camaraderie largely absent from church youth ministry or even buy-your-way-in fraternities at any college, Phelps found where he belonged. By the accounts of his fellow USMC he was a superb marine who still retained a boyish jokester personality.

Kevin Bacon did a fantastic job as a Marine Colonel - it was great watching his attitude subtly change through the whole journey.  This is a movie about a guy who reads about a fellow marine from his home town who died in Iraq. The Colonel probably figures he knows the folks in the home town, so he volunteers to escort the body home. As he makes the journey the boy turns out to be headed for another small town and we can wonder if the Colonel really wants to continue on this trip. Apparently he decides to do so, and to do so with honor. As the Colonel travels with the body, he briefly meets various people along the way. By the time he completes the journey, he has come to know a great deal about this soldier who died, as well as himself.The Fisher House mentioned on the DVD is a very real organization that supports military families.

I can only record my take.Hollywood finally got it right when they produced this one.  I cannot remember viewing a film which brought out so many emotions.  This is one of the most dignified and true to life films I think I have ever viewed.The story; a true story I might note, is the simple odyssey of a young Marine who has been killed in combat in Iraq.  The story follows his journey home to his loved ones for burial.  The film begins, as it should, with his death.  The viewer will realize right from the start that this work is a bit different.  We are not given a bunch of action shots, things being blown up or typical Hollywood special effects.  No, for the most part we see a completely black screen and only hear the sounds of combat.The film then meticulously follows this young Marine's body from the battle field, through processing in Germany and then Dover where it is then escorted by a Marine Lt Col all the way to his small home town; to his home and family for burial.This work is based upon Lt Col Mike Strobl's firsthand account of his journey with Lace Cpl. Chance Phelps, a Marine he did not know but never-the-less, a fellow Marine.The lead part is played by actor Kevin Bacon and I truly feel it is the best part Bacon has ever played.  He nailed it perfectly.  There is absolutely nothing but quiet dignity, a humble dignity in Bacon's portrayal of Strobl.This film is marked by great sadness.  I try to avoid sad movies like the plague but once I started watching this work I simply could not take my eyes off of it (three times) and I think I was wet eyed throughout the entire thing.  I should think that anyone who watches this film with out feeling and without emotion...deep feelings, has either a stone heart or is an incredibly insensitive lout.There are no special effects in this movie.  There are no contrived Hollywood type love interests; there are not political statements such as pro war or anti war.  No left wing or right wing yammering to contend with and no glitzy star studded cast.  No, this is a very simple, moving and dignified film.  It is a film about heroes, both in the military and civilian.  It is about decent people doing a decent act.War is a horrible thing and most sane people would agree with that.  This film does address one of the consequences of war; a consequence that has been played out throughout our nation's history all too often.  I was glad to see that they made a film that actually captured this on a very, very personal level.Thank you Lance Cpl Chance Phelps, Lt Col Mike Strobl and all the men and women of our armed forces.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",5,ONE OF THE MOST TRUTHFULLY EMOTIONAL FILMS I HAVE EVER SEEN.,1306972800,"06 2, 2011",2011,2699,"['What', 'write', 'film', 'already', 'not', 'been', 'said', 'here', 'can', 'only', 'record', 'take.Hollywood', 'finally', 'got', 'right', 'when', 'produced', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'viewing', 'film', 'brought', 'out', 'so', 'many', 'emotions', 'one', 'most', 'dignified', 'true', 'life', 'films', 'think', 'have', 'ever', 'viewed.The', 'story', 'true', 'story', 'might', 'note', 'simple', 'odyssey', 'young', 'Marine', 'who', 'been', 'killed', 'combat', 'Iraq', 'story', 'journey', 'home', 'loved', 'ones', 'burial', 'film', 'should', 'death', 'viewer', 'will', 'realize', 'right', 'start', 'work', 'bit', 'different', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'bunch', 'action', 'shots', 'things', 'being', 'blown', 'up', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'special', 'effects', 'No', 'most', 'part', 'see', 'completely', 'black', 'screen', 'only', 'hear', 'sounds', 'combat.The', 'film', 'then', 'meticulously', 'young', 'Marine', 'body', 'battle', 'field', 'processing', 'Germany', 'then', 'Dover', 'where', 'then', 'escorted', 'Marine', 'Lt', 'Col', 'way', 'small', 'home', 'town', 'home', 'family', 'burial.This', 'work', 'based', 'Lt', 'Col', 'Mike', 'Strobl', 'firsthand', 'account', 'journey', 'Lace', 'Cpl', 'Chance', 'Phelps', 'Marine', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'never-the-less', 'fellow', 'Marine.The', 'lead', 'part', 'played', 'actor', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'truly', 'feel', 'best', 'part', 'Bacon', 'ever', 'played', 'nailed', 'perfectly', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'humble', 'dignity', 'Bacon', 'portrayal', 'Strobl.This', 'film', 'marked', 'great', 'sadness', 'try', 'avoid', 'sad', 'movies', 'plague', 'once', 'started', 'watching', 'work', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'take', 'eyes', 'three', 'times', 'think', 'was', 'wet', 'eyed', 'entire', 'thing', 'should', 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'film', 'out', 'feeling', 'emotion', 'deep', 'feelings', 'stone', 'heart', 'incredibly', 'insensitive', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'are', 'contrived', 'Hollywood', 'type', 'love', 'interests', 'are', 'not', 'political', 'statements', 'such', 'pro', 'war', 'anti', 'war', 'left', 'wing', 'right', 'wing', 'yammering', 'contend', 'glitzy', 'star', 'studded', 'cast', 'No', 'very', 'simple', 'moving', 'dignified', 'film', 'film', 'heroes', 'military', 'civilian', 'decent', 'people', 'doing', 'decent', 'act.War', 'horrible', 'thing', 'most', 'sane', 'people', 'would', 'agree', 'film', 'address', 'one', 'consequences', 'war', 'consequence', 'been', 'played', 'out', 'nation', 'history', 'too', 'often', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'made', 'film', 'actually', 'captured', 'very', 'very', 'personal', 'level.Thank', 'Lance', 'Cpl', 'Chance', 'Phelps', 'Lt', 'Col', 'Mike', 'Strobl', 'men', 'women', 'armed', 'forces.Don', 'BlankenshipThe', 'Ozarks']",Taking Chance

It's a simple story made into a heartfelt film -- Marine Lieutenant Colonel Michael Strobl (perfectly played by Kevin Bacon) accompanies the remains of Private First Class Chance Phelps from the mortuary at Dover AFB in Delaware to his home in Wyoming.The Marine's death in Iraq occurs in the tense first minute of the film, with viewers only hearing the radio chatter and the explosion on a black screen. The screen comes to light with PFC Phelps' remains being sent to the U.S. The care of the remains and the personal effects makes visible and gives dignity to the anonymous work at Dover AFB.The story takes the viewer into some seldom-seen corners of America -- from airport cargo facilities to the mountain highways of Wyoming -- and shows everywhere the reverence for the fallen. When the escort gives Phelps' watch, dog tags, and wooden cross to his parents, eight days after his death, even men will feel the tears coming. Finally, as LtCol Strobl (who had not yet been to Operation Iraqi Freedom when he accompanied Phelps' remains home) thinks over the experience, there's a meditation on where duty lies for a Marine Corps officer.Director Ross Katz, Kevin Bacon, and HBO have given us a profound film that grants us a rare look not at America's prosperity, or freedoms, or politics -- but rather America's soul.-30-",5,A moving and profound film,1235606400,"02 26, 2009",2009,1404,"['viewed', 'film', 'pre-screening', 'left', 'theater', 'deeply', 'moved', 'simple', 'story', 'made', 'heartfelt', 'film', 'Marine', 'Lieutenant', 'Colonel', 'Michael', 'Strobl', 'perfectly', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'remains', 'Private', 'First', 'Class', 'Chance', 'Phelps', 'mortuary', 'Dover', 'AFB', 'Delaware', 'home', 'Wyoming.The', 'Marine', 'death', 'Iraq', 'occurs', 'tense', 'first', 'minute', 'film', 'viewers', 'only', 'hearing', 'radio', 'chatter', 'explosion', 'black', 'screen', 'screen', 'light', 'PFC', 'Phelps', 'remains', 'being', 'sent', 'U.S', 'care', 'remains', 'personal', 'effects', 'visible', 'dignity', 'anonymous', 'work', 'Dover', 'AFB.The', 'story', 'viewer', 'seldom-seen', 'corners', 'America', 'airport', 'cargo', 'facilities', 'mountain', 'highways', 'Wyoming', 'everywhere', 'reverence', 'fallen', 'When', 'escort', 'Phelps', 'watch', 'dog', 'tags', 'wooden', 'cross', 'parents', 'eight', 'days', 'death', 'even', 'men', 'will', 'feel', 'tears', 'coming', 'Finally', 'LtCol', 'Strobl', 'who', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'Operation', 'Iraqi', 'Freedom', 'when', 'accompanied', 'Phelps', 'home', 'experience', 'meditation', 'where', 'duty', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'officer.Director', 'Ross', 'Katz', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'HBO', 'have', 'given', 'profound', 'film', 'rare', 'look', 'not', 'America', 'prosperity', 'freedoms', 'politics', 'rather', 'America', 'soul.-30-']",Taking Chance

The answer is very good.Kevin Bacon plays Mike Strobl, a lieutenant colonel of marines who volunteers to take home the remains of marine Private First Class Chance Phelps. It is unusual for an officer to request or take such an assignment, but there is more reason than what the colonel gives, that both he and Phelps are from the same town.As the journey begins we learn how Chance Phelps' body is treated from the time of his death. An honor guard renders honors as the flag-draped coffin is placed on a transport plane from Iraq and lands in Delaware. We see his watch removed from his lifeless hand caked with grime and blood. The blood on the watch and his St. Christopher medal that failed to guide him to safety is gently cleaned with a fine mist. His fingernails are brushed and cleaned, and a group of tailors create a new dress blue uniform that will fit him perfectly. His ribbons are arranged in proper order.Colonel Strobl waits his turn ""taking Chance."" As each coffin leaves Dover AFB, the escorts form a line outside to render a salute to each passing hearse that will now bring its share of grief to various parts of the country. Finally, Mike Strobl is given specific instructions and carries the personal effects on his person at all times.A reservations clerk has tears on her face as she upgrades the officer to first class. Stops in Philadelphia, Minnesota, and Wyoming show how much a single death moves a nation. Gardeners stop work and remove their hats. An airline attendant hands the marine a small crucifix. Ground crews on the tarmac gravitate toward the belly of the plane, stand straight, and place their hand over their hearts as the casket is removed. Passengers pass the conveyer belt with looks of grief and shock, suddenly aware of the cargo that was beneath them. A convoy of cars shines their bright headlights in the Wyoming and Montana daylight as they pass the hearse with the flag-draped coffin.Equally poignant is the self-doubt that plagues the colonel and the sergeant who trained young Phelps. The sergeant wonders if he is responsible for posthumously promoted Chance Phelps' death. ""Shouldn't I have done more to protect him?"" he asks. Strobl questions his worthiness as a marine because he didn't volunteer for combat duty, wanting to come back to his family at the end of each day. Both marines suffer a common military affliction--guilt that they are among the living.What makes this film work so well is its simplicity. It isn't a vulgar display of jingoism nor morbid, and it has only a hint of anti-war sentiment when you see a USA Today newspaper (if you are opposed to this war as I have been). Under superb direction, every part is low-keyed. The emotion is not overindulged; it is understated, but the viewer cannot help being touched by the quiet display of reverence and tribute. It might rouse your anger, but it will definitely touch your heart. That's what makes this a moving film that should not be missed.It also brings home a central message. There is no glory in war; there is only grief.L/Cpl. Chance Phelps (1984-2004) was just twenty years old.

A well-done and poignant reminder of what is happening every day to our troops while we fret over the death of Michael Jackson.It was hard not to be emotional about the movie. As a 24 year Air Force veteran, I was lucky to avoid being directly in any combat theater, from Viet Nam to Desert Storm. However, I supported those troops that went there either directly or indirectly. It is such a change to see the how the people of America react from when I first joined the AF in 69.In 1970 I came back from technical school in Illinois and was at LAX waiting for my dad when I encountered some protesters. They spit on me and called me ""baby burner."" I'd never even been further west than Catalina Island, so to have them do that was just a sign of what they were doing to some of the guys and gals that actually went to Viet Nam.I was later told by a college professor that my incident never happened. He said he studied the era and the hippies and protesters loved and supported the GI's, but just hated the leadership. Well, excuse me? I thought it was ironic when I saw a TV cop show in the late 70's and that same ""baby burner"" curse was used in the dialogue.Of course, not all people hated someone in uniform, not even back in the early 70's, and I was made more than welcome most places. As I watched the movie, I got flashes of the outstanding treatment I have received over the years from 99% of the people I encountered while in uniform.Today, we are in a whole different ball game.

I came to hear of this documentary while reading about the Marine Corps and decided to download the movie to my ipod. I have since bought the DVD as gifts and think it is probably one of the most moving performances ever. Understated, crystallizing the greatest values of America: empathy, patriotism and a sense of duty. The IPOD download (from the apple store) did not come with the special features and so the DVD is a better buy. I have watched and rewatched this movie and come away teary eyed each time. Kudos to HBO, Kevin Bacon, Marcelo Zarvos and the entire cast and crew! To Lt. Col. Strobl: thank you for documenting with such clarity, thoughtfulness and insight what happens to our fallen, for posterity. To the Phelps': thank you from a grateful family.Synopsis (from Apple):In 2004, Lt. Col. Michael Strobl volunteered to escort home the body of a 19-year-old Marine killed in Iraq. It would prove to be a life-altering experience. Kevin Bacon stars as Strobl in this profoundly moving HBO Films drama that looks at the military rituals for honoring its war dead from the perspective of one fallen soldier named Chance Phelps. Strobl never knew Phelps before taking the assignment, but as he journeys across America, he discovers the great diligence and dignity in how the military handle such dark duties--and comes to grips with his own issues of guilt when he meets Chance's gracious family and friends.

As the amazon product text says, the film is unimpeachable by staying away from either pro- or anti-war propaganda. It is remotely about the current Iraq war, though really it is about the military subculture, its traditions and ceremonies when it comes to home base rituals. It shows with simple clarity how rituals are the agent that keeps us sane when we have no real reasons to be sane.Kevin Bacon is a number-crunching senior Marine officer in home base during the war, an analyst. He was in the first gulf war, but didn't see much action even then. He feels bad about that, has his personal version of a midlife crisis and walks out on his lovely family for a queer mission: he has volunteered to escort the casket of a fallen Marine to the place where his parents live, in the Far North-West.That is quite a trip and involves two flights including an over-night lay-over. We stay with Bacon and experience an endless stream of respectful behavior by air passengers, flight crews, luggage handlers and others. He arrives amid the funeral activities and has to hand over the personal effects to a split set of parents, each with a new spouse. There is a military sister with a military fianc&eacute;, there are pals from the dead man's unit, and veterans of all wars of the century. The previous one.Some observations: Bacon is as brilliant as he usual is. For sure this is one of his best roles.I watched the movie with my wife, and when it was over and she had dried her tears, we agreed that despite all respect, let's face it, it is war propaganda after all. What happens is that the military role in the world is accepted implicitly and unchallenged. We do what we do because it is our duty and when we die we do so without a question. The right to question does not even arise as a theoretical option. Whether the war is just, legitimate, right, worth the sacrifice, does not even grow up to be a registered question.A eureka moment about this particular war: the family of the dead Marine has printed a card asking mourners not to give flowers but to donate money for a fund that provides flak jackets to the soldiers at the front.How moving and how sick at the same time! The richest nation in the world relies on  private donations to provide equipment to their men at the front? The US is running deep into debt but does not have the funds for basic safety equipment for their soldiers?Maybe this movie is anti-war in a roundabout way after all?",5,Escort service,1278547200,"07 8, 2010",2010,2597,"['film', 'had', 'one', 'most', 'unanimous', 'receptions', 'here', 'amazon', 'will', 'not', 'try', 'contradict', 'overwhelmingly', 'positive', 'verdict', 'amazon', 'product', 'text', 'film', 'unimpeachable', 'staying', 'away', 'pro-', 'anti-war', 'propaganda', 'remotely', 'current', 'Iraq', 'war', 'really', 'military', 'subculture', 'traditions', 'ceremonies', 'when', 'home', 'base', 'rituals', 'simple', 'clarity', 'how', 'rituals', 'are', 'agent', 'sane', 'when', 'have', 'real', 'reasons', 'be', 'sane.Kevin', 'Bacon', 'number-crunching', 'senior', 'Marine', 'officer', 'home', 'base', 'war', 'analyst', 'was', 'first', 'gulf', 'war', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'action', 'even', 'then', 'bad', 'personal', 'version', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'out', 'lovely', 'family', 'queer', 'mission', 'volunteered', 'escort', 'casket', 'fallen', 'Marine', 'place', 'where', 'parents', 'live', 'Far', 'North-West.That', 'quite', 'trip', 'two', 'flights', 'including', 'over-night', 'lay-over', 'stay', 'Bacon', 'experience', 'endless', 'stream', 'respectful', 'behavior', 'air', 'passengers', 'flight', 'crews', 'luggage', 'handlers', 'others', 'funeral', 'activities', 'hand', 'personal', 'effects', 'split', 'set', 'parents', 'new', 'spouse', 'military', 'sister', 'military', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'are', 'pals', 'dead', 'man', 'unit', 'veterans', 'wars', 'century', 'previous', 'one.Some', 'observations', 'Bacon', 'as', 'brilliant', 'usual', 'sure', 'one', 'best', 'roles.I', 'watched', 'movie', 'wife', 'when', 'was', 'over', 'had', 'dried', 'tears', 'agreed', 'respect', 'let', 'face', 'war', 'propaganda', 'What', 'military', 'role', 'world', 'accepted', 'implicitly', 'unchallenged', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'duty', 'when', 'die', 'do', 'so', 'question', 'right', 'question', 'not', 'even', 'arise', 'theoretical', 'option', 'war', 'just', 'legitimate', 'right', 'sacrifice', 'not', 'even', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'registered', 'question.A', 'eureka', 'moment', 'particular', 'war', 'family', 'dead', 'Marine', 'printed', 'card', 'asking', 'mourners', 'not', 'give', 'flowers', 'donate', 'money', 'fund', 'flak', 'jackets', 'soldiers', 'front.How', 'moving', 'how', 'sick', 'same', 'time', 'richest', 'nation', 'world', 'private', 'donations', 'provide', 'equipment', 'men', 'front', 'US', 'running', 'deep', 'debt', 'not', 'have', 'funds', 'basic', 'safety', 'equipment', 'soldiers', 'Maybe', 'movie', 'anti-war', 'roundabout', 'way']",Taking Chance

This movie takes a look inside something that most of us never think anything about: what happens when a US military service member is killed in battle.I'm sure that many of you have seen the pictures of the caskets as they come into Andrews Airforce Base in Dover, Delaware. It is a sobering reminder of what happens when a country is at war.The question is, what happens to those caskets after they come in? This movie answers all of those questions, and it does it in a very moving way.The story is based on an essay written by LTC (Retired) Mike Strobl. Strobl volunteered in 2004 to escort the remains of a young man killed in Iraq.This is about Strobl's personal journey. Strobl is working at Quantico, Virginia as a manpower-deployment analyst. He feels guilty because although he served in the first Gulf War, he hasn't deployed overseas this time. He volunteers to escort the remains of a young marine from his hometown.The young man he escorted was Chance Phelps, a marine killed in the April 2004 surge, one of the bloodiest parts of the war. Although Strobl doesn't know Phelps, he wants to do something to honor this young marine because they're from the same hometown.What I liked the most about this movie is that it gives a rare glimpse into what really happens behind the scenes when a US service member dies. Each set of remains is treated with the utmost respect. Service members are carefully prepared for burial, and they are buried in a perfectly prepared uniform regardless of whether the service member is viewed during the funeral or not.I have to say I cried. As a veteran, these are my brothers and sisters who are dying. As a parent, this could have been my child.By the end of the movie I felt like I knew the people in this story, who they really are/were, and what their lives were really like.Regardless of your feelings on the war, this movie is a reminder of the high cost of war, and what our service members have done for us. It is a relief that at least in death we are able to render them a type of respect they might not have received in life.This movie is not to be missed.",5,Paying Tribute to Those Who Died for Our Freedom,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,2192,"['have', 'seen', 'lot', 'movies', 'time', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'one', 'one', 'movie', 'look', 'something', 'most', 'never', 'think', 'anything', 'what', 'when', 'US', 'military', 'service', 'member', 'killed', 'battle.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'have', 'seen', 'pictures', 'caskets', 'come', 'Andrews', 'Airforce', 'Base', 'Dover', 'Delaware', 'sobering', 'reminder', 'what', 'when', 'country', 'war.The', 'question', 'what', 'caskets', 'come', 'movie', 'questions', 'very', 'moving', 'way.The', 'story', 'based', 'essay', 'written', 'LTC', 'Retired', 'Mike', 'Strobl', 'Strobl', 'volunteered', '2004', 'escort', 'remains', 'young', 'man', 'killed', 'Iraq.This', 'Strobl', 'personal', 'journey', 'Strobl', 'working', 'Quantico', 'Virginia', 'manpower-deployment', 'analyst', 'guilty', 'served', 'first', 'Gulf', 'War', ""n't"", 'deployed', 'overseas', 'time', 'escort', 'remains', 'young', 'marine', 'hometown.The', 'young', 'man', 'escorted', 'was', 'Chance', 'Phelps', 'marine', 'killed', 'April', '2004', 'surge', 'one', 'bloodiest', 'parts', 'war', 'Strobl', ""n't"", 'know', 'Phelps', 'do', 'something', 'honor', 'young', 'marine', ""'re"", 'same', 'hometown.What', 'liked', 'most', 'movie', 'rare', 'glimpse', 'what', 'really', 'scenes', 'when', 'US', 'service', 'member', 'dies', 'set', 'remains', 'treated', 'utmost', 'respect', 'Service', 'members', 'are', 'carefully', 'prepared', 'burial', 'are', 'buried', 'perfectly', 'prepared', 'uniform', 'regardless', 'service', 'member', 'viewed', 'funeral', 'not.I', 'have', 'say', 'cried', 'veteran', 'are', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'who', 'are', 'dying', 'parent', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'child.By', 'end', 'movie', 'felt', 'knew', 'people', 'story', 'who', 'really', 'are/were', 'what', 'lives', 'were', 'really', 'like.Regardless', 'feelings', 'war', 'movie', 'reminder', 'high', 'cost', 'war', 'what', 'service', 'members', 'have', 'done', 'relief', 'least', 'death', 'are', 'able', 'render', 'type', 'respect', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'received', 'life.This', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",Taking Chance

It's very evident that everyone involved in this film was showing our fallen heroes their own respect and gratitude. The cinematography, music, acting and simply every aspect of this film is a profound ""thank you"" to all of the service men and their families, who have made such a huge sacrifice.Appropriately so, there is little dialog in this movie.  Yet, the emotion that is portrayed is incredibly powerful and deeply moving.  Although I always considered Kevin Bacon an excellent actor, his performance was so perfect that an Oscar would not be adequate recognition for his efforts.  Mr. Bacon shows the level of acting that can only come from a place of intense care and respect for the subject matter, and I cannot think of another acting performance by anyone, that has more impact.  In fact, all of the actors did an incredible job and should be commended.I don't think I've ever run across a movie that so eloquently deals with the incredible sacrifices our service men and their families make.  No politics, no agenda, no over-dramatizations and obsession with box office dollars.  Just a beautiful story told with honor and dignity.

The well-wishes of everyone who encountered the fallen soldier was emotionally true and impactful. But at the end of the film, I realized that I'd been led into a very sick place--sick enough that I was motivated to write this review. I think the easiest way to get a proper perspective on ""Taking Chance"" is to imagine for a moment that the fallen soldier isn't an American. Chance is a Russian soldier who was killed fighting in Afghanistan and is being conducted home by a member of the Russian military and is being honored along the way by Russian citizens. As much as we might be emotionally struck by the admiration and respect accorded to the soldier, we would not accept that respect blindly. The soldier was armed, he was in Afghanistan at the Russian government's behest to kill people, and he died in combat. We cannot admire and respect him without asking two questions: a) Was he fighting for a just cause? and b) Was his sacrifice based on a moral conviction about the rightness of the war, or was it based on blind allegiance to his homeland and blind faith in the wisdom of the Kremlin? Because ""Taking Chance"" never bothers to ask any questions about what Chance was fighting for, it suggests that blind allegiance is to be respected and admired. That's moral bankruptcy. George Washington did not want America to have a standing army, because he feared the power that a permanent army would give the government and the mentality that this would foster. Every soldier bears the moral responsibility for his/her actions. If we're going to criticize the soldiers in Hitler's army for their actions, we must expect our own soldiers to be thoughtful about the moral rightness of theirs. The idea that moral considerations are antithetical to an effective military is a sick one, but this is the assumption hidden inside ""Taking Chance.""

1236995,A1FNW6H983I87V,B001TOD6N4,"Loves To Read ""Lu""","[5, 5]","STORY - Based on a true life events, this HBO docudrama follows the journey of Lt. Col. Mike Strobl who volunteers to escort the body of Chance Phelps, who was killed in action in Iraq, to his home. Strobl initially volunteered because he saw that Phelps, whom he had never met, was from the same home town in Colorado. It turns out, however, that the family wants him buried in Dubois, Wyoming and the real reason he wants to accompany the body is a deep feeling of guilt for not serving in Iraq. This is not only the personal story of Mike Strobl but an incredible look at the process of getting the bodies of fallen soldiers from foreign soil to their final home. The care, reverence, honor and respect that characterizes this process is amazing. From the smallest detail of making sure the last uniform they wear is absolutely perfect to the protocol of everyone involved along the way, including the civilians involved from airline ticket clerks to the pilot of the plane, the love and care will overwhelm you. It is also the story of Pfc. Chance Phelps, whose promotion to Lance Corporal had been overlooked the week before his death, a young man who died way before he should have. A gunner in a Humvee, his mission partners credit him for saving their lives when their convoy is hit by an IED. A potential college scholarship athlete, he chose the Marines to serve his country the best way he knew how. Like many gifted, confident young men, he probably thought he was invincible. Another terrific HBO movie and a great tribute to those who serve our country prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Make sure to have a Kleenex handy.

1236998,AKX28FGA6L47J,B001TOD6N4,Mark,"[0, 0]","I stumbled across this very special film a few nights ago while flipping channels and I honestly can't recall a time when I felt so profoundly moved by a movie.I used to watch the Sunday morning news program ""This Week With George Stephanopoulos"" and there was always a part in the show where they would do an ""In Memoriam"" segment and list the names / ages and homes of those service people who were killed in Iraq / Afghanistan the previous week. And I always found it to be a very sombre and sobering minute or so when you would see the names of these 19 and 20 year olds who lost their lives on some dusty road outside of Kandahar or Baghdad, for example.I's hard to put into words what makes this film so special. Perhaps it's because so many of the film's most poignant moments did not require any dialogue - the scene where the baggage handlers on the tarmac pause, while Chance's casket is coming down the conveyor belt, to pay their respects. Or the young boy and girl at the airport looking down on his coffin and trying to make sense of what they're seeing. The landscaper in the distance who removes his cap and stops working for a moment as the casket becomes visible.There's numerous moments like these throughout the film and it's very difficult to keep your emotions in check when you realize the countless times this scene has played out over the years. As other reviewers have so eloquently stated, these moments transcend politics when you realize the extent of the sacrifice these men and women have made so that people ike you and I can enjoy all of the freedoms we experience in our lives each and every day.In Canada where I live now, there's a major highway - the 401 - that essentially runs the course of the country. It's recently been renamed the Highway of Hero's and whenever a fallen Canadian soldier returns to Canada after losing his / her life in Afghanistan, for example,thousands and thousands of people will line this highway and the overpasses to pay their respects as the vehicle carrying the soldier to his final resting place passes by. It really is a remarkable scene, particularily in view of the fact that 99.9% of the people did not have a personal relationship with the fallen soldier.The final moments of this special film contain photographs and actual film footage of Chance Phelps as a young boy growing into manhood and it's so sad to watch him knowing that his life has ended so quickly and so suddenly.Like so many others, I sometimes take for granted the incredible sacrifice these individuals make on my behalf.After seeing this very moving film, I don't think I will ever adopt that mindset again.A very special thanks to Lt. Col.

I have talked with Field Medical Service Corpsmen of the current vintage and see the same things going on with them as me and my fellow Corpsmen from the battlefield experienced. This movie is NOT to be avoided. The catharsis and understanding engendered by this extremely well done movie are of very real value to me. I believe that all of use can and will benefit by seeing so clearly the honor and dignity our losses have been and are treated with. I saw nothing false, nothing hoaky, nothing made up or that rang false. We lost our Marine and Corpsmen buddies on the field. We bagged them, trying to get all the right parts together. We also tried, as much as possible to treat our honored dead with dignity and respect. Then they were taken away from us and we rarely, if ever, heard another word about them.This movie clearly, honestly and explicitly shows us what happened/happens after we loose them. For me, this has very much been a healing process. Forty years and more I have carried the pain of those brothers I lost in Vietnam. Part of that pain has been put to rest. I will need to watch the film several more times, but I can feel the pain in my chest easing as I see dignity, honor, respect, acknowledgement, and caring bestowed upon our honored dead.Lt. Col. Stroble, Kevin Bacon, Ross Katz and all the others that helped get this movie to us, who did such a great job of producing a beautiful and meaningful work, are to be congratulated. One reviewer here made some rather nasty comments about these people making a profit from the dead. These people deserve every reward they garner, cash included, for their brilliant and meaningful portrayal of a story that needed to be told. It is thoughtless talk that has caused so much pain to so many of us. Please leave us some strand of dignity and honor by taking your foul comments, and holding them close so they can hurt you, instead of me.

It wastes no time in posturing on war, either for or against, or on false sentimentality. It tells the story of Marine Lt. Col. Michael Strobl (Kevin Bacon), a guilt-ridden Desert Storm veteran, and how he serves as escort for the body of PFC Chance Phelps, a 19-year-old Marine who died a hero's death in Iraq, for burial at his home in Wyoming.Based on the actual journals of Strobl, who co-wrote the screenplay with Katz, ""Taking Chance"" is as simple as it could be, and all the more powerful for it. It begins with an audio tape over the opening credits of the actual skirmish in which Phelps died, and ends with photos and home movies of him. Phelps--as presented in reminiscences both by characters in the film and by his real family and friends in the ""Special Feastures"" section--was a remarkable young man, whose high spirits and goofy sense of humor barely masked his ferocious courage and loyalty.""Taking Chance"" is a masterpiece of restrained, dignified emotion, and the performances--particularly Bacon's as Strobl--are in keeping with the film's laconic yet poignant tone.

1237025,A2EWN4ANV3CPG6,B001TOD6N4,Paul Sayles,"[5, 5]","This is a review of the DVD Taking Chance.Taking Chance is the story of a Marine's last trip home and the people he touched whom he never knew nor who knew him.  Even his escort, Lt. Col. Strobl, played by Kevin Bacon, didn't know Chance Phelps except by virtue of a shared home town.  The movie is the dramatization of the colonel's after action report.This isn't film with a particular theme, pro-war or anti-war, rather it is  a film of a Marine who went to war and was killed fighing in that war.  He was there with his squad and his friends and that is what was important.The acting is superb throughout the film and doesn't hit a false note throughout it's length.  From the mortuary driver who is at the start of the journey to the Marines at the VFW hall in Chance's home town, everyone does a superb job of acting.  One particularly serious moment is when Lt. Col. Strobl finds that one of the escorts he was with at the mortuary at Dover Air Force Base is escorting his brother home.  The interactions between the two men are simple but highly moving.The special features of the film were all very informative and added to the value of the movie.  However, if this movie should be released again, please include the cut scene of the Marine sergeant from his unit who is relieving Lt. Col. Strobl.  ""I'll watch over him"" is perhaps the most important scene of the film and sums up the whole purpose of why there is an escort in the first place.  This is a key point and I regret that it was felt necessary to cut it from the film.  It is a short segment that needs to be back in the film.As a former Marine and later a hospital corpsman assigned to Marine units, this was a particularly moving film for me.Some critics felt that the movie was just a procedural movie on how a military funeral is conducted.  To a degree there is some validity to this observation but look beyond the immediate event that is being depicted.  Watch at Dover as the hearse is being loaded and the construction crew stops and pays thier respects as the hearse goes by.  Watch again in Philadelphia as the cargo crew pays its respects to Chance and the colonel renders honors.  Look at the two children watching from the window.  Throughout the film there is a connection between PFC Phelps and people he never met nor had met him.  Yet they are all participants in this final journey home.  This movie is a procedural but it is also a story of how people's actions across the country make this tremendously sad and devastating event a bit more bearable simply by being able to share the grief of the family.  It is not trite when the colonel says that PFC Phelps was honored across the country.This is a movie that is well made and tells its simple message very well.  I highly recommend it to everyone.",5,"I'll Watch Over Him"" A simple but elequent tribute.",1247011200,"07 8, 2009",2009,2791,"['review', 'DVD', 'Taking', 'Chance.Taking', 'Chance', 'story', 'Marine', 'last', 'trip', 'home', 'people', 'touched', 'whom', 'never', 'knew', 'who', 'knew', 'Even', 'escort', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Strobl', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Chance', 'Phelps', 'virtue', 'shared', 'home', 'town', 'movie', 'dramatization', 'colonel', 'action', 'report.This', ""n't"", 'film', 'particular', 'theme', 'pro-war', 'anti-war', 'rather', 'film', 'Marine', 'who', 'went', 'war', 'was', 'killed', 'fighing', 'war', 'was', 'there', 'squad', 'friends', 'what', 'was', 'important.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'film', ""n't"", 'hit', 'false', 'note', 'length', 'mortuary', 'driver', 'who', 'start', 'journey', 'Marines', 'VFW', 'hall', 'Chance', 'home', 'town', 'everyone', 'superb', 'job', 'acting', 'One', 'particularly', 'serious', 'moment', 'when', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Strobl', 'one', 'escorts', 'was', 'mortuary', 'Dover', 'Air', 'Force', 'Base', 'escorting', 'brother', 'home', 'interactions', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'simple', 'highly', 'moving.The', 'special', 'features', 'film', 'were', 'very', 'informative', 'added', 'value', 'movie', 'However', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'released', 'again', 'please', 'include', 'cut', 'scene', 'Marine', 'sergeant', 'unit', 'who', 'relieving', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Strobl', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'perhaps', 'most', 'important', 'scene', 'film', 'sums', 'up', 'whole', 'purpose', 'why', 'escort', 'first', 'place', 'key', 'point', 'regret', 'was', 'felt', 'necessary', 'cut', 'film', 'short', 'segment', 'be', 'back', 'film.As', 'former', 'Marine', 'later', 'hospital', 'corpsman', 'assigned', 'Marine', 'units', 'was', 'particularly', 'moving', 'film', 'me.Some', 'critics', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'procedural', 'movie', 'how', 'military', 'funeral', 'conducted', 'degree', 'validity', 'observation', 'look', 'immediate', 'event', 'being', 'depicted', 'Watch', 'Dover', 'hearse', 'being', 'loaded', 'construction', 'crew', 'stops', 'pays', 'thier', 'respects', 'hearse', 'Watch', 'again', 'Philadelphia', 'cargo', 'crew', 'respects', 'Chance', 'colonel', 'honors', 'Look', 'two', 'children', 'watching', 'window', 'film', 'connection', 'PFC', 'Phelps', 'people', 'never', 'met', 'had', 'met', 'are', 'participants', 'final', 'journey', 'home', 'movie', 'procedural', 'also', 'story', 'how', 'people', 'actions', 'country', 'make', 'tremendously', 'sad', 'devastating', 'event', 'bit', 'more', 'bearable', 'simply', 'being', 'able', 'share', 'grief', 'family', 'not', 'trite', 'when', 'colonel', 'PFC', 'Phelps', 'was', 'honored', 'country.This', 'movie', 'well', 'made', 'simple', 'message', 'very', 'well', 'highly', 'recommend', 'everyone']",Taking Chance

1237040,A1ZH52JAC70RIR,B001TOD6N4,Robin Benson,"[152, 154]","A deeply moving story and another plus for HBO.  To my mind you just don't see too many movies that have this kind of honesty.  One that comes to mind was The Straight Story.  Taking Chance, though, is a completely different theme dealing with death, respect, honor, patriotism, family and love.  Fortunately all of this is handled in a straightforward no-nonsense way and thank goodness it was.  Hollywood really doesn't have too much of a reputation for presenting a simple truth without twisting it into something else.The story unfolds very much like a documentary I thought.  Kevin Bacon plays Lt. Col. Michael Strobl  as the military escort taking the body of a dead soldier home to be buried.  His performance was just right as was everyone else because the story was greater than all the parts combined.

When a home town Marine dies, he accepts (despite being an officer) to escort PFC Chance Phelps home.Along the way, from the Dover mortuary (where the military dead are processed from the field to home), to escorting his casket throughout the land to Wyoming, he meets various people from all walks of life on the flight also as moved as him in his official duty. The journey affects him with survivors guilt, but in a moment of self-incrimination, he learns that he's a witness of PFC Phelps, which also is a honor for if there were no witness there would be no remembrance.A very tasteful presentation of a side the public doesn't see, and the process of how a fallen hero/ine comes home. Kevin Bacon plays his part very convincingly without going overboard, letting not his acting in itself tell the emotion, but his stoic bearing in face of all the sadness (especially when meeting PFC's Phelps family).Idealistic as it is, the movie hits the right chords of not going overboard and corny. Just the right emotion and reflection.It's also based on the real PFC Chance Phelps who died in Iraq, with a touching memorial at the end credits, and the officer who actually escorted him home.Highly recommend watching this movie to remind people of the sacrifice on the field; for those who are tasked to care for the military dead; and all the families who are touched by their loss of a loved one in the field of strife.Semper Fi.",5,A Look at an Military Escort's Journey,1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,1580,"['profound', 'touching', 'film', 'Marine', 'officer', 'who', 'put', 'office', 'tour', 'feels', 'guilt', 'not', 'being', 'Iraq', 'fellow', 'Marines', 'When', 'home', 'town', 'Marine', 'being', 'officer', 'escort', 'PFC', 'Chance', 'Phelps', 'home.Along', 'way', 'Dover', 'mortuary', 'where', 'military', 'dead', 'are', 'processed', 'field', 'home', 'escorting', 'casket', 'land', 'Wyoming', 'various', 'people', 'walks', 'life', 'flight', 'also', 'as', 'moved', 'official', 'duty', 'journey', 'survivors', 'guilt', 'moment', 'self-incrimination', 'witness', 'PFC', 'Phelps', 'also', 'honor', 'were', 'witness', 'there', 'would', 'be', 'remembrance.A', 'very', 'tasteful', 'presentation', 'side', 'public', ""n't"", 'see', 'process', 'how', 'fallen', 'hero/ine', 'home', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'part', 'very', 'convincingly', 'going', 'overboard', 'letting', 'not', 'acting', 'tell', 'emotion', 'stoic', 'bearing', 'face', 'sadness', 'especially', 'when', 'meeting', 'PFC', 'Phelps', 'family', 'movie', 'right', 'chords', 'not', 'going', 'overboard', 'corny', 'Just', 'right', 'emotion', 'reflection.It', 'also', 'based', 'real', 'PFC', 'Chance', 'Phelps', 'who', 'died', 'Iraq', 'touching', 'memorial', 'end', 'credits', 'officer', 'who', 'actually', 'escorted', 'home.Highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'movie', 'remind', 'people', 'sacrifice', 'field', 'who', 'are', 'tasked', 'care', 'military', 'dead', 'families', 'who', 'are', 'touched', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'field', 'strife.Semper', 'Fi']",Taking Chance

Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of this film but this film is more about sending a message than about conventional movie making.""Taking Chance"" is a simple story that goes through the excuciating details of what happens when a soldier is killed in action, overseas, and how their body is returned home. The movie is a huge promoter/endorser/advocate for the U.S. military.Kevin Bacon is a former ""Desert Storm"" soldier that is now a pure administrator for the U.S. Marines. He has a loving family yet is somewhat reserved about enjoying his subdued, civilian-like life. One evening, Bacon notices that a soldier killed in action is from his small home town in Colorado and he volunteers to escort the body home. From here, this film is all about the strict protocol utilized in escorting that body home.The film goes through meticulous detail as to the honor and respect that is brought to the deceased soldier. Bacon is un-flinchable in doing everything possible to always treat the deceased soldier with the ut-most of honor.SPOILER ALERT:  In the end, the viewer is hit with a huge emotional wallop when you learn that the soldier is not fictional but rather a real person. Home movies and photos of the subject of this film will cause an emotional outburst by any viewer.Every character in this movie is righteous, with some of the civilian characters being [arguably] unrealistically, overly righteous. All the military personel treat every facet of the death with complete dignity. Every civilian that intermingles with Bacon is also completely righteous.This film achieves it's apparent purpose of dignifying and honoring a horrible tragedy. It's emotional, very patriotic and informative.My only qualm with the movie is that it may have been more interesting (and more resemble a ""movie""] if it would have displayed more of the obvious, even if that obvious may be ugly,  painful and demeaning to some sectors of the country. While the majority of the country is supportive of the war, it is inescapable that there is a certain apathetic aspect to this war as it endlessly lingers. Casualties have been depressingly relegated towards the back pages of newspapers. That conflict, of the country being apathetic as the war is prolonged, would have made the movie more emotionally powerful.The movie does not address how many of these soldiers were thrust into combat not because they expected or wanted it, but because they were in the National Guard and did not anticipate that they were going into combat for such long periods of time. In such a situation, these deaths offer an unusual dimension and must catch surviving family members so off guard.Lastly, the pain that must be inflicted upon the families seemes to be, in this movie, a bit oversanitized. The funeral that takes place in this small town lacked [for what I expected] real emotion. Such young people, dying so far away, in a war where the enemy is not always easy to define has to cause a terrible pain that was neccessary to include in the story.Although he plays a pretty much one dimensional character, Kevin Bacon, was excellent and brought his star charisma to this film. His performance elevates this film.This movie was very powerful but it's essentially just a ""made for TV"" special.",4,"Due to the subject matter, this movie cannot be reviewed like a normal movie",1307923200,"06 13, 2011",2011,3319,"['have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'made', 'HBO', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'fan', 'film', 'film', 'more', 'sending', 'message', 'conventional', 'movie', 'making', 'Taking', 'Chance', 'simple', 'story', 'excuciating', 'details', 'what', 'when', 'soldier', 'killed', 'action', 'overseas', 'how', 'body', 'returned', 'home', 'movie', 'huge', 'promoter/endorser/advocate', 'U.S.', 'military.Kevin', 'Bacon', 'former', 'Desert', 'Storm', 'soldier', 'now', 'pure', 'administrator', 'U.S.', 'Marines', 'loving', 'family', 'yet', 'somewhat', 'reserved', 'enjoying', 'subdued', 'civilian-like', 'life', 'One', 'evening', 'Bacon', 'soldier', 'killed', 'action', 'small', 'home', 'town', 'Colorado', 'escort', 'body', 'home', 'here', 'film', 'strict', 'protocol', 'utilized', 'escorting', 'body', 'home.The', 'film', 'meticulous', 'detail', 'honor', 'respect', 'brought', 'deceased', 'soldier', 'Bacon', 'un-flinchable', 'doing', 'everything', 'possible', 'always', 'treat', 'deceased', 'soldier', 'ut-most', 'honor.SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'end', 'viewer', 'hit', 'huge', 'emotional', 'wallop', 'when', 'learn', 'soldier', 'not', 'fictional', 'rather', 'real', 'person', 'Home', 'movies', 'photos', 'subject', 'film', 'will', 'cause', 'emotional', 'outburst', 'viewer.Every', 'character', 'movie', 'righteous', 'civilian', 'characters', 'being', '[', 'arguably', ']', 'unrealistically', 'overly', 'righteous', 'military', 'personel', 'treat', 'facet', 'death', 'complete', 'dignity', 'civilian', 'Bacon', 'also', 'completely', 'righteous.This', 'film', 'apparent', 'purpose', 'dignifying', 'honoring', 'horrible', 'tragedy', 'emotional', 'very', 'patriotic', 'only', 'qualm', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'more', 'resemble', 'movie', ']', 'would', 'have', 'displayed', 'more', 'obvious', 'even', 'obvious', 'may', 'be', 'ugly', 'painful', 'demeaning', 'sectors', 'country', 'majority', 'country', 'supportive', 'war', 'inescapable', 'certain', 'apathetic', 'aspect', 'war', 'lingers', 'Casualties', 'have', 'been', 'depressingly', 'relegated', 'back', 'pages', 'newspapers', 'conflict', 'country', 'being', 'apathetic', 'war', 'prolonged', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'more', 'emotionally', 'powerful.The', 'movie', 'not', 'address', 'how', 'many', 'soldiers', 'were', 'thrust', 'combat', 'not', 'expected', 'wanted', 'were', 'National', 'Guard', 'did', 'not', 'anticipate', 'were', 'going', 'combat', 'such', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'such', 'situation', 'deaths', 'offer', 'unusual', 'dimension', 'must', 'catch', 'surviving', 'family', 'members', 'so', 'off', 'guard.Lastly', 'pain', 'must', 'be', 'inflicted', 'families', 'be', 'movie', 'bit', 'oversanitized', 'funeral', 'place', 'small', 'town', 'lacked', '[', 'what', 'expected', ']', 'real', 'emotion', 'Such', 'young', 'people', 'dying', 'so', 'far', 'away', 'war', 'where', 'enemy', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'define', 'cause', 'terrible', 'pain', 'was', 'neccessary', 'include', 'story.Although', 'pretty', 'much', 'one', 'dimensional', 'character', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'was', 'excellent', 'brought', 'star', 'charisma', 'film', 'performance', 'film.This', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'powerful', 'essentially', 'just', 'made', 'TV', 'special']",Taking Chance

That is why they are aware of it.  Therefore, no death (and no life) is ever 'wasted.'  No one ever dies 'in vain.'"" --CWG""Taking Chances"" is one of the most moving films I've seen in recent years.  The film not only speaks to the fallen soldiers of America, but to the men and women who are aware of them.  It tells the true story of Lt. Colonel Mike Strobl.  He spends much time going through a list of names of soldiers who have been killed in the Second Gulf War.  He prays that he never recognizes a name.  However, one Private First Class, Chance Phelps, jumps out at him.  Not because he knows him, but because he's from the same small town in Colorado.  This is enough to establish a connection for Strobl.Strobl puts requests escort duty, in which a member of the military escorts the body back to the place where it will be buried.  This is an unusual request for a senior officer, but his Commanding Officer grants the request.  Strobl will escort the body of Chance Phelps from Dover to a small town in Wyoming.  His job is to assure the safe delivery of the body, and to also give Phelps's personal effects to the family.At first, it seems that Strobl feels duty-bound to escort the body.  He knows little personal information about Phelps.  But the reaction he receives from nearly everyone he comes across, concerning a fallen soldier,that none of these people know, begins to move Strobl, and he finds a growing connection to Phelps with each stop, until he reaches his final resting place in Wyoming.The power of this film rests in small moments.  They are simple moments, but powerful nonetheless.  A group of luggage carriers all stop what they are doing to pay their respects.  Strobl looks around and is clearly moved by the gesture.  There is another moment when he is escorting the body by car, back to the small town.  A line of cars of people, who see the casket with the flag over it in the back of the SUV, all begin to turn on their lights, and lead a procession of other vehicles all the way to the town.  None of them know who Chance is.  It doesn't matter.  They are paying their respects, and demonstrating their gratitude for his service to this country.The power of the this film rests in these simple gestures of gratitude and respect by nearly everyone who comes across the body of Chance Phelps.  There is a powerful moment, when Strobl finally opens the coffin to view Chance, and to help another officer place certain personal items into it.  We almost expect Strobl to quicky close the casket.  Instead, he stands and gazes at the perfection of the uniform of Chance Phelps, and he is soon moved to tears over the body of a man he does not know.  The film does a great job of never showing us the face of Chance Phelps (since he killed by a shot to the head), and it really does not matter.  I felt this was a wise move by the filmmakers.The film does a tremendous job in educating the viewer regarding the process that a ""body"" goes through from the time the soldier dies to its final resting place.  Great effort is undertaken by the men and women who do their absolute best to assure that the body is cared for and cleaned.  They do their best to make sure there is no evidence of blood upon the fallen soldier's personal effects.There are many people who will tell you that it is impossible to not feel something when you become aware of someone who has passed away.  It doesn't matter whether you know them or not, you are affected by that person.  Perhaps that is why I chose the quote that I did for this review.A person can disagree with the reason for a ""war.""  But, I find it hard to believe that anyone doesn't support our military troops, and honor them.  The movie demonstrates this in so many small windows of opportunity, showing that Americans do hold a fallen soldier with the utmost respect.  Within the film, it's clear that even Strobl is moved by these simple demonstrations.  I would wager that many soldiers are perhaps unaware of this respect and gratitude.  Strobl meets a man on of the planes.  The man simply looks at him and thanks him for his service.  I've done the same thing with a few military people whom I've come across.  I feel that it means a lot to them to hear that they are appreciated.Kevin Bacon may have turned in one of his best performances as Mike Strobl.  There isn't a lot of dialogue in this film, and so much of the emotion rests in simple looks upon the face of Kevin Bacon as Mike Strobl, and what he is feeling.  That is all that is needed.  Words somehow seem insufficient, and I think the director and writers did an admirable job by showing restraint regarding the dialogue within this film.This film should be required viewing, especially at the high school level and above.  I feel that it would serve our young people to learn to appreciate the service of our military men and women.Mike Strobl has provided an incredible service, by allowing his journal to be used for the making of this film.  He was also one of the screenwriters.  He has taken careful steps to assure that the ""story"" of Chance Phelps is told, as well as that of every fallen American soldier.  Every life has a story, and every person in death, also has a story.  Our awareness, our respect, and our gratitude are all that is needed.",5,America's Respect For the Fallen,1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,5418,"['**SPOILER', 'ALERTS**', 'death', 'person', 'always',

Michael Strobl, who wrote eloquently of them in a widely circulated 2004 article, Taking Chance is a profoundly emotional look at the military rituals taken to honor its war dead, as represented by a fallen Marine killed in Iraq, Lance Corporal Chance Phelps.Working as a strategic analyst at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia, Lt. Col. Strobl (Kevin Bacon) learns that Phelps had once lived in his hometown, and volunteers to escort the body to its final resting place in Wyoming.As Strobl journeys across America, he discovers the great diligence and dignity in how the military, and all those involved with preparing and transporting the body, handle their duties. Equally important, he encounters hundreds of people affected by Chances death, a vast majority of whom never knew him.This collective grieving eventually causes Lt. Col. Strobl, a veteran of Desert Storm now assigned to office duty, to probe his own guilt about not re-deploying to Iraq for the current conflict.Arriving in Wyoming, Lt. Col. Strobl completes his catharsis when he encounters Chances gracious family and friends, and discovers an extraordinary outpouring of community support.",3,Marine Corps.

I had long since read the preview information and knew exactly what to expect in the film, though I must say I was even more pleased with how respectfully the film treats all of the subject matter it covered.  What could have been political wasn't, and instead simply and poignantly concentrates on the process that the military uses for handling the casualties of war and military service that are inevitable in times of conflict.This film makes a great companion for another film that HBO also aired: Section 60 (Arlington National Cemetery).  If you can only see one then I'd be hard pressed to recommend which of the two you should see as both were of such top quality.  Both also serve as fine examples of why HBO tends to clean up during award seasons, and I'd be shocked if Taking Chance doesn't win HBO a few more awards to add to HBO's trophy case.Have a hanky or kleenex handy when you watch this film as you'll likely need 'em to wipe away a few tears as this film progresses.  Sadly what we get to see in this film is just one example of a process that has happened too many times over the last several years.

1237065,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B001TOD6N4,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[6, 61]","Other reviewers have covered the story line: Lt. Col. Mike Strobl, a Marine paper pusher (he labels himself in almost those words) sees the name of a PFC killed in Iraq. The casualty is from Strobl's home town so he feels compelled to take the deceased Marine home.One item, though, that I don't think anyone elsed covered: Strobl nearly ""confronts"" his superiors as to whether it's appropriate that still more die in Iraq. They tell him in essence that he's not in a position to challenge the policy makers. It's an important element of the film to remember.The film certainly stimulates various emotions. Kevin Bacon--whose acting is excellent as usual in this film--in a little add-on comments on the specific ""rituals"" used while the remains of the person are carried back to his or her home. Some of those rituals are almost enough to make the watcher stand up and express respect for the dead. The music too evokes emotions throughout the film. As does the photography. The scene just after Strobl/Bacon salutes Chance at the cemetery, with the sky just about ready to break into a storm, is particularly stimulating.What has become almost routine in films these days is time warps, i.e., scenes in which a character is reflecting on what has happened already so the scene switches to the past, then back to the present. One scene to which the camera returns frequently is at the mortuary in Dover where the staff is cleaning the remains. The scene is done in slow motion leading to a macabre effect, almost eerie. But what it made me think of is how much is done for show. The script indicates that Chance Phelps' funeral will be closed casket as he's not exactly presentable. But his body has been cleaned, his uniform is perfect. The situation in which he was killed was horrible--it was the real world. But what's important is the show... Just something to think about.So, why my ""title?"" We tend to glorify war, the military in general these days. I don't say that's an American phenomenon. I think everyone does it. We use words like ""hero"" toward almost anyone killed in battle; we glorify them, and the ""battles"" in which they lost their lives. When their remains return home, we glorify them all the more. At the VFW hall in Phelps' town, there's a ""God Bless Chance Phelps"" sign. It seems just about every male character in the film is former or present military. A fleet of vehicles end up accompanying the remains on the highway, and all turn on their lights, take off their hats, and become a funeral procession.Is that not why such wars continue?For the record, NO: I'm not degrading Chance Phelps. I'm not complaining about Mike Strobl. I'm not challenging the sorrow of Phelps' parents. I feel as much compassion for them as the next guy, maybe more. But, like Lt. Col. Strobl toward the beginning of the film, perhaps we should all be challenging our being in the situation that killed PFC Phelps--and the many, many others who're dying there. Perhaps we should be shedding more tears, that those many may have died in vain. And that could be perhaps our worst fear!And perhaps those tears, instead of leading us to romanticize the condition of those who died, should prod us to prevent others from dying, tomorrow or a millenium from now.Overall, it's a pretty good film. And there is SOME feel of the futility of it all. But, again, we need to question rather than glorify the conditions which lead to the death of so many of our countrymen--and women--these days.",4,Why?,1237420800,"03 19, 2009",2009,3489,"['Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'covered', 'story', 'line', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Mike', 'Strobl', 'Marine', 'paper', 'pusher', 'almost', 'words', 'name', 'PFC', 'killed', 'Iraq', 'casualty', 'Strobl', 'home', 'town', 'so', 'compelled', 'take', 'deceased', 'Marine', 'home.One', 'item', 'though', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'elsed', 'covered', 'Strobl', 'nearly', 'confronts', 'superiors', 'appropriate', 'still', 'more', 'die', 'Iraq', 'tell', 'essence', 'not', 'position', 'challenge', 'policy', 'makers', 'important', 'element', 'film', 'remember.The', 'film', 'certainly', 'various', 'emotions', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'acting', 'excellent', 'usual', 'film', 'little', 'add-on', 'comments', 'specific', 'rituals', 'used', 'remains', 'person', 'are', 'carried', 'back', 'home', 'rituals', 'are', 'almost', 'enough', 'make', 'watcher', 'stand', 'up', 'express', 'respect', 'dead', 'music', 'too', 'evokes', 'emotions', 'film', 'photography', 'scene', 'just', 'Strobl/Bacon', 'Chance', 'cemetery', 'sky', 'just', 'about', 'ready', 'break', 'storm', 'particularly', 'stimulating.What', 'become', 'almost', 'routine', 'films', 'days', 'time', 'warps', 'i.e.', 'scenes', 'character', 'reflecting', 'happened', 'already', 'so', 'scene', 'past', 'then', 'back', 'present', 'One', 'scene', 'camera', 'frequently', 'mortuary', 'Dover', 'where', 'staff', 'cleaning', 'remains', 'scene', 'done', 'slow', 'motion', 'leading', 'macabre', 'effect', 'almost', 'eerie', 'what', 'made', 'think', 'how', 'much', 'done', 'show', 'script', 'Chance', 'Phelps', 'funeral', 'will', 'be', 'closed', 'casket', 'not', 'exactly', 'presentable', 'body', 'been', 'cleaned', 'uniform', 'perfect', 'situation', 'was', 'killed', 'was', 'horrible', 'was', 'real', 'world', 'what', 'important', 'show', 'Just', 'something', 'think', 'about.So', 'why', 'title', 'tend', 'glorify', 'war', 'military', 'general', 'days', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'American', 'phenomenon', 'think', 'everyone', 'use', 'words', 'hero', 'almost', 'anyone', 'killed', 'battle', 'glorify', 'battles', 'lost', 'lives', 'When', 'remains', 'return', 'home', 'glorify', 'more', 'VFW', 'hall', 'Phelps', 'town', 'God', 'Bless', 'Chance', 'Phelps', 'sign', 'just', 'about', 'male', 'character', 'film', 'former', 'present', 'military', 'fleet', 'vehicles', 'end', 'up', 'accompanying', 'remains', 'highway', 'turn', 'lights', 'take', 'off', 'hats', 'become', 'funeral', 'procession.Is', 'not', 'why', 'such', 'wars', 'continue', 'record', ""'m"", 'not', 'degrading', 'Chance', 'Phelps', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining', 'Mike', 'Strobl', ""'m"", 'not', 'challenging', 'sorrow', 'Phelps', 'parents', 'feel', 'as', 'much', 'compassion', 'next', 'guy', 'maybe', 'more', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Strobl', 'beginning', 'film', 'perhaps', 'should', 'be', 'challenging', 'being', 'situation', 'killed', 'PFC', 'Phelps', 'many', 'many', 'others', 'who', ""'re"", 'dying', 'there', 'Perhaps', 'should', 'be', 'shedding', 'more', 'tears', 'many', 'may', 'have', 'died', 'vain', 'could', 'be', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'fear', 'perhaps', 'tears', 'instead', 'leading', 'romanticize', 'condition', 'who', 'died', 'should', 'prod', 'prevent', 'others', 'dying', 'tomorrow', 'millenium', 'now.Overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'SOME', 'feel', 'futility', 'again', 'need', 'question', 'rather', 'glorify', 'conditions', 'lead', 'death', 'so', 'many', 'countrymen', 'women', 'days']",Taking Chance

We gain insight into the process and procedure of how the fallen are prepared and transported to their families (something that i'd wager most Americans are not aware of - for example, soldiers are in dress uniforms, are transported feet first during their journey home, how their personal effects are handled, and the duties of the accompanying serviceman at each stage of the trip), as well as his observations during the trip (that many civilians pause to pay their respects and express their gratitude, particularly when they discover the purpose of his traveling).

(at the time of his death) Chance Phelps, a 19 yo member of the 1st Marine Division, serving in Iraq who was Killed In Action on Good Friday, 2004.The film takes no position regarding the War yet only chronicles, straight from Strobl's notes, the journey of Chance Phelps from Dover Delaware where his body was prepared for internment in Dress Blues  to Dubois, Wyoming, where his parents live, to this day, and where he ultimately was laid to rest.The acting and direction is near flawless and having read stellar review after stellar review on Amazon, it was the only 5 Star Movie that I have ever seen on that venue.  I wept from the moment that I started watching this film to the end.  The simplicity of this film, with limited dialogue and great cinematography underscores the significance of the subject matter and presents to the viewer a moving  record of the respect, care and honor given to this young and fallen hero ""and a rare, genuine, and heartfelt peek into the monumental sacrifices of those in the military and their families.""I urge you to see this film, Russell.

Their message: Your son was killed in action in Iraq.""Taking Chance"" is an unusual movie.  This film documents the real life story of Lieutenant Colonel Michael Strobl escorting the body of Lance Corporal Chance Phelps, from the U.S. Military overseas mortuary reception center in Dover Air Force Base to the site of his burial  service in rural Wyoming.LTC Strobl volunteered for the duty when he noticed that Chance was born in his hometown of Clifton Colorado (a suburb of Grand Junction, Colorado, also my hometown).  Colonel Strobl decided this action was the least he could do for a man from his hometown.""Taking Chance"", written from the journal LTC Strobl kept on his journey, brilliantly presents the reactions of many individuals who  witnessed Strobl's activity during his trip, as well as Chance's family and friends in Dubois.  As Strobl carefully escorts, honors, and salutes  Chance's remains, observers join with their own actions of respect and honor.  The caring and patriotic response was sincere and heartfelt.The movie shows amazing attention to detail from the handling of the body in the combat zone, through transport to his hometown.  ""Taking Chance"" is truly impressive in the exquisite detail of the careful preparation of the remains, from cleaning battle debris from every part of the body, careful ironing of his uniform,  polishing of the belt buckle, and buttons, to checking and placing all medals and ribbons on his uniform.  All these actions are preformed  with respect and careful love of Nation, and the Marine.While on active duty I served several times as a Causality Assistance Officer.  Although I lead several grave-site  performances, and once was tasked as notification officer, who informs a family of their loss, I was unaware of the intimate care for the body itself.  This movie paints a wonderful picture of mortuary assistants preparing the remains for burial.""Taking Chance"" is a superb movie that gives great esteem to our war casualties and to our Armed Forces.  I believe that this is a film that all  Americans should see as it show the price some of our families pay for the defense of our nation's policies.

Though he doesn't know Phelps, Strobl requests that he be allowed to accompany the body from Dover, Del. to the Phelps' hometown in Wyoming.There is no pro-war or anti-war message here - this is purely a poignant and heartfelt retelling of a fallen Marine's journey home, and of the honor and respect accorded to Phelps' as he makes his final journey home, accompanied by Lt Col Strobl who is himself awed and suitably grateful for all the respect accorded to Phelps' as he accompanies the casket back to Wyoming.This is a subtly done movie and the performance by Bacon as Lt Col Strobl is understated yet effective - this is no dialogue-heavy movie, neither is it action-packed...all through the movie, it is the visual images that stay with the viewer, and of people's reactions to the casket carrying Phelps' body, as well reactions to Strobl as people discover the purpose of his mission.I cried many times during this movie, and I'm not easily moved by what I see in movies - there is a sense of profound sadness throughout this story, and yet as a viewer, I was also overcome by an overwhelming feeling of gratitude for the services of our troops and the risks they face daily.
