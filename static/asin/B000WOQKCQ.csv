I knew next to nothing about Mr. Bean, except that he was a famous comical character. I have seen Rowan Atkinson playing short parts in other films (for example, the seller in Love, Actually) and he seemed to me a good comedian, though nothing exceptional. So I was surprised on how much I enjoyed this movie about Mr. Bean basically traveling throughout France, and creating fun mayhem around it, how much I laugh at it. The gag in the restaurant goes back to silent cinema, but it's still effective. And when Mr. Bean arrives at the Cannes Film Festival, its mockery of the pretensions of art cinema is dead on (the ""art film"" shown in the festival directed by Willem Dafoe is a riot). Plus, the actress playing his ""love interest"" (Emma de Caunes) is extremely good.

The acting is very good with Mr. Bean never saying more than 10 words during the entire film. He is joined bya cast of great commedians taht support the odd story. Mr. Bean expresses himself with mime and he is a true master of this comedy art form using and updating many routines seen in the work of Buster Keaton, the Three Stooges, and even Mr. Magoo comics. The soundtrack is a bright commentary on the action with opera and classic French popular music integrated with some American pop from the 1970s.  I found the European perspective was refreshing compared to many American films that are too fast paced and lack subtle humor integrted with the outrageously silly. I strongly recommend the film.

1110835,A2CVP31XTYSZFE,B000WOQKCQ,"Celia Hayes ""Sgt. Mom""","[3, 3]","Whether or not you find this DVD hilarious or as thrilling as watching paint dry rather depends on how much a fan you are of Rowan Atkinson, the 1980s's British answer to Jerry Lewis. If you care about as much for either one as you would for having root-canal dentistry performed with a jack-hammer,  then you can skip this DVD entirely, and the rest of the review too. Although Mr. Bean, the near-to-silent, endlessly inventive, rubber-faced (and apparently rubber-limbed) every-schlub is a little quieter than Jerry Lewis, he is just as comically accident-prone.After all, who else on earth could find himself with his foot caught on a tall clothing rack, above his head... on a French TV production set... while costumed as a WWII German soldier... because he was practicing a really, really enthusiastic goose-step... after being shanghaied as an extra. The film involved is a commercial for yogurt, by the way. What the logic is in that, I have no idea, although Mr. Bean subsequently manages to blow up the director.The plot, such as it exists is gossamer thin, and in places reminiscent of the classic Mr. Hulot's Holiday, being almost entirely composed of sight gags and gentle pratfalls. Mr. Bean wins a charity raffle first prize; a camcorder and an all expense paid trip to the French Riviera.  He gets as far as Paris before the inevitable cascade of misfortune begins. In short order and in no particular order he manages to get his tie caught in a vending machine, fill an expensive handbag with raw oysters and causes a visiting Russian filmmaker to miss the train to Cannes. He also looses his bus ticket to a chicken, after miming a performance of  ""O Mio Bambino Caro"" in a French open-air market in concert with the young son of the aforementioned Russian filmmaker, and has his bicycle run over by a tank He does eventually manage to reach Cannes and the seaside that he has been dreaming of while his home movies of the trip win a standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival ... don't ask me to explain how that happened, but be assured there is some gentle fun to be had in skewering self-indulgent movie directors. Don't miss Willem Dafoe's brief turn as an auteur filmmaker/movie star with a hilariously awful but artistic movie. Whatever else can be said about Willem Dafoe, he does have enough confidence to parody himself. And the locations, especially those shot in and around the South of France are beautiful, as gorgeous as an expensive coffee-table book.Overall, Mr. Bean's Holiday is a gentle, old-fashioned comedy - the kind of family friendly comedy that is hardly ever made any more; it can hardly be more unlike something like ""Borat"" and still be on the same planet. Some bits that are funnier that others, but there is nothing mean, foul-mouthed or vulgar about ""Mr. Bean"".It will even bear watching over and over again. Extras include more than twenty minutes of scenes that were omitted from the finished film, and three aptly titled features: ""French Beans"", which followed some of the more elaborate set-pieces filmed in the Luberon locations, ""Beans in Cannes"", explained how the crew managed to film on location during the international film festival, and ""The Human Bean"" featured brief interviews and reminiscences with other cast members.",5,A Nice Little Serving of Bean,1241308800,"05 3, 2009",2009,3287,"['Whether', 'not', 'find', 'DVD', 'hilarious', 'as', 'thrilling', 'watching', 'paint', 'dry', 'rather', 'how', 'much', 'fan', 'are', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', '1980s', 'British', 'answer', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'care', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'would', 'having', 'root-canal', 'dentistry', 'performed', 'jack-hammer', 'then', 'can', 'skip', 'DVD', 'entirely', 'rest', 'review', 'too', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'near-to-silent', 'endlessly', 'inventive', 'rubber-faced', 'apparently', 'rubber-limbed', 'every-schlub', 'little', 'quieter', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'just', 'comically', 'accident-prone.After', 'who', 'else', 'earth', 'could', 'find', 'foot', 'caught', 'tall', 'clothing', 'rack', 'head', 'French', 'TV', 'production', 'set', 'while', 'costumed', 'WWII', 'German', 'soldier', 'was', 'practicing', 'really', 'really', 'enthusiastic', 'goose-step', 'being', 'shanghaied', 'extra', 'film', 'involved', 'commercial', 'yogurt', 'way', 'What', 'logic', 'have', 'idea', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'subsequently', 'blow', 'up', 'director.The', 'plot', 'such', 'gossamer', 'thin', 'places', 'reminiscent', 'classic', 'Mr.', 'Hulot', 'Holiday', 'being', 'almost', 'entirely', 'composed', 'sight', 'gags', 'gentle', 'pratfalls', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'charity', 'raffle', 'first', 'camcorder', 'expense', 'paid', 'trip', 'French', 'Riviera', 'as', 'far', 'Paris', 'inevitable', 'cascade', 'misfortune', 'begins', 'short', 'order', 'particular', 'order', 'get', 'tie', 'caught', 'vending', 'machine', 'fill', 'expensive', 'handbag', 'raw', 'oysters', 'visiting', 'Russian', 'filmmaker', 'miss', 'train', 'Cannes', 'also', 'bus', 'ticket', 'chicken', 'miming', 'performance', 'O', 'Mio', 'Bambino', 'Caro', 'French', 'open-air', 'market', 'concert', 'young', 'son', 'aforementioned', 'Russian', 'filmmaker', 'bicycle', 'run', 'tank', 'eventually', 'manage', 'reach', 'Cannes', 'seaside', 'been', 'dreaming', 'home', 'movies', 'trip', 'win', 'standing', 'ovation', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'explain', 'how', 'happened', 'be', 'assured', 'gentle', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'skewering', 'self-indulgent', 'movie', 'directors', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'brief', 'turn', 'auteur', 'filmmaker/movie', 'star', 'hilariously', 'awful', 'artistic', 'movie', 'else', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'have', 'enough', 'confidence', 'parody', 'locations', 'especially', 'shot', 'South', 'France', 'are', 'beautiful', 'as', 'gorgeous', 'expensive', 'coffee-table', 'book.Overall', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'Holiday', 'gentle', 'old-fashioned', 'comedy', 'kind', 'family', 'friendly', 'comedy', 'hardly', 'ever', 'made', 'more', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'more', 'something', 'Borat', 'still', 'be', 'same', 'planet', 'bits', 'are', 'funnier', 'others', 'nothing', 'mean', 'foul-mouthed', 'vulgar', 'Mr.', 'Bean', '.It', 'will', 'even', 'bear', 'watching', 'over', 'again', 'Extras', 'include', 'more', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'scenes', 'were', 'omitted', 'finished', 'film', 'three', 'aptly', 'titled', 'features', 'French', 'Beans', 'followed', 'more', 'elaborate', 'set-pieces', 'filmed', 'Luberon', 'locations', 'Beans', 'Cannes', 'explained', 'how', 'crew', 'managed', 'film', 'location', 'international', 'film', 'festival', 'Human', 'Bean', 'featured', 'brief', 'interviews', 'reminiscences', 'other', 'cast', 'members']",N/A
1110836,A2OTT4J4JLCL1G,B000WOQKCQ,"C. Gregory ""C. Gregory""","[1, 2]","Ever since a friend of mine told me to watch Mr. Bean on HBO back in the day, I have since loved every second of his hilarious mishaps. I was one of those people who didn't understand, when seeing commercials, what could possibly be so funny. The commercials kinda left out what the concept was. Someone earlier said american's tend to like fast comedies and bupring/fart jokes and whatever. I consider myself very critical of comedies. I don't care if it's ""dumb humor"" (humor that is dumb on purpose to make you laugh) I don't mind some gross humor, I don't care what kind it is, but as long as it's genuinely funny. So I love movies like Ghostbusters, Johnny Dangerously,Dumb and Dumber, Tommy Boy, My Fellow Americans, and Caddyshack. Even Rodney Dangerfield would be able to elevate a normally stupid movie and make me laugh out loud. Which, by the way, is the only way you should laugh. So in came Mr. Bean. I didn't know what to expect, but my friend up till then never steered me wrong. So I watched. At first I thought, this is a bit odd. And, then, even though I still had that same opinion, I realised I was laughing hysterically. He captured the silent clown comdey of chaplin, the classic facial expressions of someone like Lucille Ball, He also had his own style that is unable to be categorized. I was hooked. So anytime it came on I watched. Then the videos came out and i bought all the vhs tapes and eventually the Whole Bean on DVD which was upsetting because they edited out hilarious scenes. Not even sure why. They had plenty of room on the dvds to even add more:( but that's not mr. bean's fault that's the studio's. Anyway, the first mr bean movie wasn't really a mr. bean movie it's like they tried to make him mainstream. I would have preferred two hours of skits actually. Once u have mr. bean talking, u don't have mr bean, he would say stuff in the show but it was small stuff like his name or mentioning teddy etc.  He was not meant to be a mainstream character. He was meant to be someone who didn't fit in with the real world, hence the opening scene of the show in which he appeared to ""just fall to earth"". He was a boy in a man's body. He didn't act within the confines or rules of normalised society, we knew every thing he did was not appropriate or something a grown up man would actually do, that's what made it funny. As for Mr. Bean's holiday, even though it could have moved faster, it was still more true to the original. It's hard to say how mr bean should play out in a movie simply because he only did maybe ten or fifteen minutes at a time, and even then, it was random. Comedy, though doesn't need a plot to work. I hate when people say it does. All it needs is the setup. To say this movie doesn't make sense until the end, misses the point. It's all about Mr. Bean and the chaos he creates. This movie was more true to character than the first one though, and it shows. I would highly reccomend this one. Also I would reccomend mr. bean fans to check out ""the Thin Blue Line"" which is available on dvd in amazon, and ""Black Adder"" both are stylistically different than Mr. Bean but some of the best comdey I've ever seen come out of the uk and better than a lot of U.S. Released Stuff.

I think you can only take so much of Rowan Atkinson's ""Mr. Bean."" A newcomer to him (believe-it-or-not), I found him a lot of fun in the first half of the film but, boy, this guy is tough to take in longer dosages. I wonder if others feel that way?It's weird; the film was entertaining.....but I found myself looking at my watch a lot during the last 20 minutes, hoping it would end.  Atkinson's goofy faces are very funny at first but get tiresome after an hour.It was a ""cute"" story, anyway, and certainly one the whole family could watch. There is nothing, language or sex-wise, that would offend anyone. This is just old-fashioned, almost silent-film-type slapstick comedy.  Actually I probably laughed more at the ultra- corny lines delivered by Willem Dafoe, whose character pokes fun at film makers.The film, though, belongs to Atkinson who is in about every scene and hams it up to the max. If you laugh at his contorted facial expressions and limber body (check out his karaoke work!), you'll love the film.

After winning a raffle for a vacation package to lightmarish Cannes, France from pleasantly rainy England, Mr. Bean takes his complimentary camera to film the trip, immediately experiencing various hilarious mishaps, including dumping coffee on a laptop..., to misplacing his passport, train ticket, and inadvertently separating a boy and his father; wherein the two eventually become friends and cooperate together to raise money to contact the father and travel to Cannes.With his trusty camcorder chronicling the trip, Poor Mr. Bean experiences Murphy's Law at every turn, but somehow always manages to emerge from various predicaments all the better. Other scenes include a grueling raw shrimp sea food luncheon while under the gaze of a condescending Maitre'D, chasing a chicken on a bicycle across the French countryside, becoming stranded {getting confined in an outhouse}, and taking part in a film production wherein Bean dresses as a Nazi soldier {whose goose-stepping antics get him quite literally stuck}, dancing for coins, and even cross-dressing!While hitch-hiking, he meets a cute French girl named Sabine along the way, who just so happens to have a part in director ""Carson Clay's"" {Willem Defoe} boringly pretentious and exaggerated self-aggrandizing production at the Cannes film festival, ending up, through Mr. Bean's efforts, providing appropriate exposure for Sabine.Finally, through all the obstacles, a joyously blissful Mr. Bean reaches the beach, and the picture in the brochure comes to life. Towards the end, the film strangely becomes a musical, probably as an expression to convey the impression of an erstwhile European production, and actually manages to grant the viewer the sensation of being a tourist overall.While not quite as amusing as his adventure to America in the first Mr. Bean film, Mr. Bean's Holiday is still a welcomed, hilarious voyage into this most entertaining character.

The title recalls Mr. Hulot's Holiday and the film has the feel of a French film, which, as it takes place in France, makes it thoroughly delightful.It's not simply a few Bean sight gags strung together. There's a gentle undercurrent that washes through the film, culminating, fittingly, on the beach at Cannes. The only movies that worked this well at a leisurely pace that I can recall are Vacation and Pee Wee's Big Adventure. This film manages to be simple and grand at the same time.

I know Rowan Atkinson from the Black Adder series, as well as his bid for immortality as the voice of Zazu in Disney's The Lion King. Bean shows had been recommended to me for years, as I love vintage comedy and British comedy. Having seen this film, now I don't know why I waited so long.Mr. Bean's Holiday was a total delight from start to finish. At this time, I can't speak for other Bean shows and the first film, but my entire family could not get enough of this film. A sure sign a DVD is a hit is when my daughter watches it again the next day. She particularly enjoyed the ending, when Bean invades the Cannes Film Festival, goes into the projection booth and ... I shouldn't tell you, you have to see it.We particularly liked the scenes in which Bean lip-synched in the park, begged for money in a train station. It even has a grand finale with a cast of seeming thousands. Like so many fun comedies, it's loaded with memorable set pieces to watch again and again, linked with a simple story line.There is almost nothing for parents to worry about with this G-rated movie if their kids watch with them (even though it takes place on the Riviera), with the exception of two ""d"" words (in subtitles) and an outtake in which the leading lady lies down in the street in despair (there are no subtitles in the deleted scenes, and like as Ed Norton noted about Ralph Kramden, I don't speak French). I think she's acting out a scene). Bean has a tendency to walk away from disasters he has contrived, much like Laurel and Hardy did when they destroyed someone's house or something like that. it's all very ""cartoony"" in fact, Atkinson's mumbles remind me of the Fleischer Popeye cartoons (which I HIGHLY recommend on the new Warner DVD).There's no audio commentary (but that seems fitting for a film with so little dialogue) and there are a few short documentaries and deleted scenes.",4,Now I want to see more of this modern day Keaton/Chaplin/Laurel/Hardy/Popeye,1197849600,"12 17, 2007",2007,1980,"['family', 'approached', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'Holiday', 'little', 'Bean', 'foreknowledge', 'must', 'admit', 'know', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'Black', 'Adder', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'bid', 'immortality', 'voice', 'Zazu', 'Disney', 'Lion', 'King', 'Bean', 'shows', 'had', 'been', 'recommended', 'years', 'love', 'vintage', 'comedy', 'British', 'comedy', 'Having', 'seen', 'film', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'waited', 'so', 'long.Mr', 'Bean', 'Holiday', 'was', 'total', 'delight', 'start', 'finish', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'other', 'Bean', 'shows', 'first', 'film', 'entire', 'family', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'film', 'sure', 'sign', 'DVD', 'hit', 'when', 'daughter', 'watches', 'again', 'next', 'day', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'ending', 'when', 'Bean', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'projection', 'booth', 'should', ""n't"", 'tell', 'have', 'see', 'it.We', 'particularly', 'liked', 'scenes', 'Bean', 'lip-synched', 'park', 'begged', 'money', 'train', 'station', 'even', 'grand', 'finale', 'cast', 'seeming', 'thousands', 'so', 'many', 'fun', 'comedies', 'loaded', 'memorable', 'set', 'pieces', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'linked', 'simple', 'story', 'almost', 'nothing', 'parents', 'worry', 'G-rated', 'movie', 'kids', 'watch', 'even', 'place', 'Riviera', 'exception', 'two', 'd', 'words', 'subtitles', 'outtake', 'leading', 'lady', 'down', 'street', 'despair', 'are', 'subtitles', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'noted', 'Ralph', 'Kramden', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'French', 'think', 'acting', 'out', 'scene', 'Bean', 'tendency', 'walk', 'away', 'disasters', 'contrived', 'much', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'did', 'when', 'destroyed', 'someone', 'house', 'something', 'very', 'cartoony', 'fact', 'Atkinson', 'mumbles', 'remind', 'Fleischer', 'Popeye', 'cartoons', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'new', 'Warner', 'DVD', 'audio', 'commentary', 'fitting', 'film', 'so', 'little', 'dialogue', 'are', 'few', 'short', 'documentaries', 'deleted', 'scenes']",N/A

He also wins a never-to-parted-with handycam as part of the package win. These are enough and off he sets. However, where there's Mr. Bean, how can trouble be far behind...There are twists and turns, in typical Mr. Bean style, and he's able to separate a son from his father, miss his train, lose his passport, miss the bus which he had to take instead of the train, drive with his eyelids clipped open, drive an egotistical movie director nuts, win over the heart of a budding French actress... the list can go on and on.But then, you aren't here to read the story and all the pranks. You'd much rather see them. And, IMO, that would be an excellent idea!The child in Mr. Bean (rather, the child Mr. Bean!) takes over this movie, and he's been able to deliver an even better package than the original movie years ago.What separates a Mr. Bean movie from other slapstick creations of the genre is that he takes amusement (of the audience) to new heights, hitherto maintained by the likes of Sir Charles Chaplin. Whoever says really funny gags require good dialogue delivery doesn't know Mr. Bean.Atkinson has made unbelievably funny moments out of otherwise drab sequences.. like (trying to) dial all the possible nos. to reach the boy's father, lip-syncing an opera on a sunny afternoon in a suburban French town marketplace, eating a seafood platter... in short, really a commendable job.Why not 5 / 5 - you ask?

It's always hard to understand why, when you really enjoy something, everybody else doesn't enjoy it also. However, I have to admit that Mr. Bean is clearly not everybody's cup of tea. My husband and I have loved him for years and were thrilled to show this movie to our two young sons and see them laugh riotously all the way through. We just got the dvd out and watched it again last night, and even after about 4 viewings, all of us were still laughing. Every time I watch this movie I see something else that I missed. I suspect that folks who dislike this movie may not have watched it closely enough, because we find nuances to the jokes every time we watch. Yes, Bean is just plain silly, getting laughs from food and general idiocy.

(For example, he tries oysters on a half shell at a fancy restaurant and pretends to eat them/like them for the snooty waiter. When no one's looking, he dumps the slimy stuff in a lady's purse without her knowing. When her phone, inside her purse, eventually rings--he panics.)Some parts are a bit slow, but if you hang to the end, you'll find a surprisingly tight plot. I love how they tied it all together at the end (and Willem Dafoe was a marvelous sport!)However, there was some cussing in the DVD, as well as scenes of faux war--including guns blazing. I'm not a prude--don't mind violence and language normally. HOWEVER, this movie is supposedly rated G, and so I figured there wouldn't be ANYTHING remotely objectionable about this movie...so I let my 9 year old son watch it. I didn't appreciate that those elements were in the movie; it should have been PG.If you're a fan of visual comedy and the simpleminded wonderment of Mr. Bean, you'll likely enjoy this holiday movie.

Unfortunately the answer is No! The film is highly appealing to a young audience and you may find yourself laughing your heart out, but in the long run, you shall leave the theater unchanged and possibly even forgetting the past hour and a half.Story and sense is rarely a comedy's forte, and Bean doesn't try to be one of those few comedies which attempt at doing so. Actually, in its attempts to try and create a story out of nothing, the film falls flat on its face. The main ""plot"" is Bean trying to get to Cannes after a tweaked lottery win. Obviously, extremely predictable delays and obstacles ensue, and it's these delays which make up most of the film. Along the road, Bean teams up with a boy who has lost his father and they both try to reach Cannes together.Rowan Atkinson may have gone down in cinema legend for his show stopping comedy performances, but in this film he seems lost and without a proper script and a dictionary consisting of approximately 6 words, I'm afraid to say that his charm is beginning to wear off. Nevertheless, credit is still due, because I doubt that there is any other actor capable of pulling off his antics with the same amount of innocence and credibility. The boy, whose name is Stepan, is played by Max Baldry and whilst he handles his role relatively well. Willem Defoe may curse the day he committed himself to this film, but his inclusion is essential and he managed to have me roaring with laughter most of the time. It may be a bit of a career low, but I doubt his minimal role shall actually be remembered. The only female role in the film was that of Sabine, by Emma De Caunes, and I am in two minds about her. On one hand, she has charm and she silently steals the spotlight.In terms of sets and cinema magic, the film sinks rock bottom, and it constantly looks like a mediocre road movie. The fact that a video camera is commonly used may also bother the viewer. However, with all these shortcomings, the film still shines thanks to Bean and his crazy doings. They may seem ridiculous on paper, but in motion they are pure genius. This might not be the best of Bean but his facial expressions and his unforgettable voice plugs up some of the holes.",3,[3.5]--Bean Back on the Big Screen,1188864000,"09 4, 2007",2007,2297,"['been', 'quite', 'time', 'world', 'last', 'saw', 'Bean', 'was', 'return', 'truly', 'necessary', 'Unfortunately', 'answer', 'film', 'highly', 'appealing', 'young', 'audience', 'may', 'find', 'laughing', 'heart', 'long', 'run', 'shall', 'leave', 'theater', 'unchanged', 'possibly', 'even', 'forgetting', 'past', 'hour', 'half.Story', 'sense', 'rarely', 'comedy', 'forte', 'Bean', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'comedies', 'attempt', 'doing', 'so', 'Actually', 'attempts', 'try', 'create', 'story', 'nothing', 'film', 'flat', 'face', 'main', 'plot', 'Bean', 'trying', 'get', 'Cannes', 'tweaked', 'lottery', 'win', 'Obviously', 'extremely', 'predictable', 'delays', 'obstacles', 'ensue', 'delays', 'make', 'up', 'most', 'film', 'road', 'Bean', 'up', 'boy', 'who', 'lost', 'father', 'try', 'reach', 'Cannes', 'together.Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'may', 'have', 'gone', 'down', 'cinema', 'legend', 'show', 'stopping', 'comedy', 'performances', 'film', 'lost', 'proper', 'script', 'dictionary', 'consisting', 'approximately', '6', 'words', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'say', 'charm', 'beginning', 'wear', 'off', 'Nevertheless', 'credit', 'still', 'due', 'doubt', 'other', 'actor', 'capable', 'pulling', 'off', 'antics', 'same', 'amount', 'innocence', 'credibility', 'boy', 'name', 'Stepan', 'played', 'Max', 'Baldry', 'whilst', 'role', 'relatively', 'well', 'Willem', 'Defoe', 'may', 'curse', 'day', 'committed', 'film', 'inclusion', 'essential', 'managed', 'have', 'roaring', 'laughter', 'most', 'time', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'career', 'low', 'doubt', 'minimal', 'role', 'shall', 'actually', 'be', 'remembered', 'only', 'female', 'role', 'film', 'was', 'Sabine', 'Emma', 'De', 'Caunes', 'am', 'two', 'minds', 'one', 'hand', 'charm', 'silently', 'spotlight.In', 'terms', 'sets', 'cinema', 'magic', 'film', 'sinks', 'rock', 'bottom', 'constantly', 'mediocre', 'road', 'movie', 'fact', 'video', 'camera', 'commonly', 'used', 'may', 'also', 'bother', 'viewer', 'However', 'shortcomings', 'film', 'still', 'thanks', 'Bean', 'crazy', 'doings', 'may', 'seem', 'ridiculous', 'paper', 'motion', 'are', 'pure', 'genius', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'Bean', 'facial', 'expressions', 'unforgettable', 'voice', 'plugs', 'up', 'holes']",N/A

His formula feels dated, repetitive even preposterous, but despite all that, he has an international fan base that will never leave him, why would they? He brings more of the same in his new movie Mr. Bean's Holiday where our classic character has an adventure on his way to Cannes. It is a painful vacation experience for our friend, but satisfying at the end.Brief Intro Story:Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) wins a trip to Cannes (Southern France) and a small camcorder--courtesy of his local church. He is exciting and grabs his new prize at starts filming himself and things around him. As he travels, he meets a lost young boy who lost his father--who is also going to Cannes--for the famous film festival. As Bean travels with the boy, more crazy adventures awaits for them.Review:Unfortunately most of the drawbacks are created by Bean himself. We virtually watch more of the same sketches that we have seen since the creation of this character--actually his best work can be rented at your local video store. Also the scenes where Bean ""does his thing"" feel forced and sometimes just dead boring. How many times are we going to see a close-up of his face? Mr. Bean please stop recycling your own stuff. This vicious circle goes for about 80 percent of the film.But not everything is lost for this British icon. Most of the Bean fans will probably appreciate the ""Nazi"" commercial sketch and last scene of the film which is the best of his peculiar vacation. This last theater reunion scene creates a moment of joy for the characters--especially for Bean--and probably for the audience as well. Willem Dafoe is quite entertaining as the egomaniac Actor/Director Carson Clay who sees ""talent"" in someone like Bean and praises his camera technique. In other words, most of the laughs are condensed in the last 15 minutes. It is shame that the audience has to wait until this moment to get some genuine laughs.The Verdict:Ten years is a long time to wait for a sequel--and it's predictable the way it was going to turn out. Mr. Bean's Holiday brings almost nothing new to the table after all this time. Few moments and a peachy ending did not save this new effort by the British star.

1110864,A27VMEB55OY9LS,B000WOQKCQ,Kathy-W,"[0, 0]","Rowan Atkinson ought to get a medal for keeping his Mr. Bean character up to snuff a full decade after the 1997 ""Bean"" movie. We see the same general mixture of goofy facial expressions, awkward body language, and unusual gestures (well-intentioned and ill-intentioned, successful and unsuccessful) that will either be regarded as childishly immature or wondrously childlike. We see him re-plot a lost course using just a compass and a relentless focus that borders on that of an autistic savant. We see him regard an ambitious platter of French seafood with all the appeal of a root canal and bury some of it in an innocent bystander's purse. We see him accidentally make his own short film - and have it looking not half bad.This movie is slicker than the 1997 original, and perhaps not as overtly ""feel good"" (but this may simply be a mark of evolving direction tastes), yet it still has a happy - if ludicrous - ending, and is still meant to basically be a family movie. I would say that between this film and the original, the plot of the original movie is probably much easier for the younger viewers to follow and keep track of, but there's nothing strenuously hard to follow in the sequel, either. There is some unmistakable continuity in the screenplay since Robin Driscoll was still involved, so the general consistency in style might be due in equal parts to the production team and Atkinson himself.Some of the camera work is a little artsy, but this could be an inside joke, especially considering the awkwardness of an immature Brit character in France. I was happy to see a general lack of hand-held camera shots (except for the parts Bean shoots with his new toy, of course). This jittery technique tends to be a detriment to comedies, so I was happy to see that the production team didn't ""jump the shark"" on that one and give in to the supposed consensus.Some people will complain that the premise isn't strong enough and the comedy is not exactly anything new. It's true, the comedic styles are very, very close to the schtick Atkinson has always used with Mr. Bean, but my question is why mess with a good thing? It basically boils down to this: you either understand Mr. Bean or you don't. Some people obviously do still love this character if you consider the box office figures it generated ($229 million for a $25 million budget - respectable compared to some movies, and not too shabby for a 90-minute comedy).",4,A fairly fitting sequel,1394496000,"03 11, 2014",2014,2435,"['Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'ought', 'get', 'medal', 'keeping', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'character', 'up', 'snuff', 'full', 'decade', '1997', 'Bean', 'movie', 'see', 'same', 'general', 'mixture', 'goofy', 'facial', 'expressions', 'body', 'language', 'unusual', 'gestures', 'well-intentioned', 'ill-intentioned', 'successful', 'unsuccessful', 'will', 'either', 'be', 'regarded', 'childishly', 'immature', 'wondrously', 'childlike', 'see', 're-plot', 'lost', 'course', 'using', 'just', 'compass', 'relentless', 'focus', 'borders', 'autistic', 'savant', 'see', 'regard', 'ambitious', 'platter', 'French', 'seafood', 'appeal', 'root', 'canal', 'bury', 'innocent', 'bystander', 'purse', 'see', 'accidentally', 'make', 'own', 'short', 'film', 'have', 'looking', 'not', 'bad.This', 'movie', 'slicker', '1997', 'original', 'perhaps', 'not', 'overtly', 'feel', 'good', 'may', 'simply', 'be', 'mark', 'evolving', 'direction', 'tastes', 'still', 'happy', 'ludicrous', 'ending', 'still', 'meant', 'basically', 'be', 'family', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'film', 'original', 'plot', 'original', 'movie', 'probably', 'much', 'easier', 'younger', 'viewers', 'follow', 'keep', 'track', 'nothing', 'strenuously', 'hard', 'follow', 'sequel', 'either', 'unmistakable', 'continuity', 'screenplay', 'Robin', 'Driscoll', 'was', 'still', 'involved', 'general', 'consistency', 'style', 'might', 'be', 'due', 'equal', 'parts', 'production', 'team', 'Atkinson', 'himself.Some', 'camera', 'work', 'little', 'artsy', 'could', 'be', 'inside', 'joke', 'especially', 'considering', 'awkwardness', 'immature', 'Brit', 'character', 'France', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'general', 'lack', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'shots', 'parts', 'Bean', 'shoots', 'new', 'toy', 'course', 'jittery', 'technique', 'be', 'detriment', 'comedies', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'production', 'team', 'did', ""n't"", 'jump', 'shark', 'one', 'give', 'supposed', 'consensus.Some', 'people', 'will', 'complain', 'premise', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'comedy', 'not', 'exactly', 'anything', 'new', 'true', 'comedic', 'styles', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'close', 'schtick', 'Atkinson', 'always', 'used', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'question', 'why', 'mess', 'good', 'thing', 'basically', 'down', 'understand', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'do', ""n't"", 'people', 'obviously', 'do', 'still', 'love', 'character', 'consider', 'box', 'office', 'figures', 'generated', '229', 'million', '25', 'million', 'budget', 'respectable', 'compared', 'movies', 'not', 'too', 'shabby', '90-minute', 'comedy']",N/A

For years Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean character has been a worldwide sensation. You'll always hear that laughter may be the universal cure for sickness, but to find something that everyone would find funny...now THAT is the challenge! Somehow, being a man of few words, Mr. Bean has been the universal character that people all over the world love. It's not hard to see why. I always found it impressive that a character who speaks so few words (if, indeed, he speaks at all) manages to make me laugh so hard I want to bust a gut. Comparisons toCharlie ChaplinandBuster Keatonare not uncalled for. In fact, they are actually a very accurate way of describing Mr. Bean, and his new movie ""Mr. Bean's Vacation."" I must admit, humor is not the easiest thing to write about. Likewise, ""Mr. Bean's Vacation"" is not a movie I can easily describe because there isn't much to describe.There is no story in this movie. There are some connecting events, but outside the fact that Bean wins a trip to Paris and is attempting to get a lost boy to the Cannes Film Festival, there really isn't much in terms of story. Heck, there isn't even much in terms of dialog. Unlike the previous Bean film, ""Bean: The Movie,"" Mr. Bean has returned to being his clumsy, mumbling self. No speeches, no conversing in American slang, just Bean messing up in every sticky situation he gets himself in. There are moments when the film stalls, but there are much more laughs to be found then groans. In fact, I'd venture to say there were at least three scenes that had me laughing so hard, my stomach actually began to hurt. You know the feeling right? You start laughing. Then you continue laughing. Then you can't stop laughing.Then you grab your stomach in pain, trying to catch your breath, but you just can't stop laughing. Yeah, ""Mr. Bean's Vacation"" can be like that sometimes. In a rare leap of faith, most the dialog that DOES make it's way through the movie is in French, with subtitles! This makes sense since Bean is traveling with a French boy he can't communicate with, which is the source of many of the misunderstandings in this movie that results in gags. But it's also daring because the characters must come to understand each other through their body language instead of their speech, which makes the language in this movie universal. Indeed, the few times the subtitles do show up it won't matter, because even if the kids can't read the subtitles they can read the body language, and thus they still get the joke.One thing I would keep an eye out for is a scene involving Bean eating sea food, which is most likely the single funniest scene I've seen at the movies all year so far. Now, I'm going to be honest, this is an easy movie to stomp on. The art of Chaplin and Keaton is no longer appreciated by most of today's audiences, who prefer character say the f word every other word in order to gain a laugh. People also like jokes with very perverse suggestions (sometimes very perverse dialog to go with it). The idea of getting people of all ages, of all ethnic's, of all religions to one screening of ""Mr. Bean's Vacation"" and having them all laugh must sound like a foreign idea. The idea of paying $10.00 to see a movie that essentially has no story must at the very least sound strange. But ""Mr. Bean's Vacation"" is a very unique film in these regards.Yes, it has flaws. There are moments where the film just drags, and the skits aren't sown together as flawlessly as they could be, but these points are moot. The bottom line is ""Mr. Bean's Vacation"" is pure comedy. Not all of it works, but most of it does. It's something the whole family can see and not be offended by. In fact, it may even be smarter then most of the big star ""comedies"" that we've seen released this year. It's not perfect, but if you're looking for a comedy, and especially one that you can bring your kids to, ""Mr. Bean's Vacation"" is a winner.Rating: *** and a half stars",3,Still Has Much To Say With His Silence,1188086400,"08 26, 2007",2007,3991,"['Oh', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'years', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'character', 'been', 'worldwide', 'sensation', ""'ll"", 'always', 'hear', 'laughter', 'may', 'be', 'universal', 'cure', 'sickness', 'find', 'something', 'everyone', 'would', 'find', 'funny', 'now', 'THAT', 'challenge', 'Somehow', 'being', 'man', 'few', 'words', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'been', 'universal', 'character', 'people', 'world', 'love', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'always', 'found', 'impressive', 'character', 'who', 'so', 'few', 'words', 'indeed', 'make', 'so', 'hard', 'want', 'bust', 'gut', 'Comparisons', 'toCharlie', 'ChaplinandBuster', 'Keatonare', 'not', 'uncalled', 'fact', 'are', 'actually', 'very', 'accurate', 'way', 'describing', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'new', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'Vacation', 'must', 'admit', 'humor', 'not', 'easiest', 'thing', 'write', 'about', 'Likewise', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'Vacation', 'not', 'movie', 'can', 'easily', 'describe', ""n't"", 'much', 'describe.There', 'story', 'movie', 'are', 'connecting', 'events', 'fact', 'Bean', 'trip', 'Paris', 'attempting', 'get', 'lost', 'boy', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'terms', 'story', 'Heck', ""n't"", 'even', 'much', 'terms', 'dialog', 'previous', 'Bean', 'film', 'Bean', 'Movie', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'returned', 'being', 'clumsy', 'mumbling', 'speeches', 'conversing', 'American', 'slang', 'just', 'Bean', 'messing', 'up', 'sticky', 'situation', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'film', 'stalls', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'laughs', 'be', 'found', 'then', 'groans', 'fact', ""'d"", 'venture', 'say', 'were', 'least', 'three', 'scenes', 'had', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'stomach', 'actually', 'began', 'hurt', 'know', 'feeling', 'right', 'start', 'laughing', 'Then', 'continue', 'laughing', 'Then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing.Then', 'grab', 'stomach', 'pain', 'trying', 'catch', 'breath', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing', 'Yeah', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'Vacation', 'can', 'be', 'sometimes', 'rare', 'leap', 'faith', 'most', 'dialog', 'DOES', 'make', 'way', 'movie', 'French', 'subtitles', 'sense', 'Bean', 'traveling', 'French', 'boy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'communicate', 'source', 'many', 'misunderstandings', 'movie', 'results', 'gags', 'also', 'daring', 'characters', 'must', 'come', 'understand', 'other', 'body', 'language', 'instead', 'speech', 'language', 'movie', 'universal', 'Indeed', 'few', 'times', 'subtitles', 'do', 'show', 'up', 'wo', ""n't"", 'matter', 'even', 'kids', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read', 'subtitles', 'can', 'read', 'body', 'language', 'thus', 'still', 'get', 'joke.One', 'thing', 'would', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'scene', 'involving', 'Bean', 'eating', 'sea', 'food', 'most', 'likely', 'single', 'funniest', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'year', 'so', 'far', 'Now', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'honest', 'easy', 'movie', 'stomp', 'art', 'Chaplin', 'Keaton', 'no', 'longer', 'appreciated', 'most', 'today', 'audiences', 'who', 'prefer', 'character', 'say', 'f', 'word', 'other', 'word', 'order', 'gain', 'laugh', 'People', 'also', 'jokes', 'very', 'perverse', 'suggestions', 'sometimes', 'very', 'perverse', 'dialog', 'go', 'idea', 'getting', 'people', 'ages', 'ethnic', 'religions', 'one', 'screening', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'Vacation', 'having', 'laugh', 'must', 'sound', 'foreign', 'idea', 'idea', 'paying', '10.00', 'see', 'movie', 'essentially', 'story', 'must', 'very', 'least', 'sound', 'strange', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'Vacation', 'very', 'unique', 'film', 'regards.Yes', 'flaws', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'film', 'just', 'drags', 'skits', 'are', ""n't"", 'sown', 'together', 'as', 'flawlessly', 'could', 'be', 'points', 'are', 'moot', 'bottom', 'line', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'Vacation', 'pure', 'comedy', 'Not', 'most', 'something', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'see', 'not', 'be', 'offended', 'fact', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'smarter', 'then', 'most', 'big', 'star', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'released', 'year', 'not', 'perfect', ""'re"", 'looking', 'comedy', 'especially', 'one', 'can', 'bring', 'kids', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'Vacation', 'winner.Rating', '***', 'half', 'stars']",N/A

Both would be pleased to see a movie featuring this character that is suitable for the whole family.Actor Rowan Atkinson created the character of Mr. Bean for English television some time back. A hit overseas, the show became a staple much like Monty Python, winding up on PBS where enthusiastic viewers fell in love with the dimwitted character whose luck always seemed to turn out good.In MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY, we find Mr. Bean the lucky winner of the church raffle for an all expenses paid trip to the French Riviera, including a camcorder to record his trip. But just like the TV show, no trip for someone like Mr. Bean could turn out normal.Along the way, Bean ends up accidentally separating a young boy and his father. To make amends, he attempts to help the two reunite. But again, we're talking Bean here, not a normal hero. The adventures of the pair as they try to make their way to Cannes where the boy's father is are hilarious. And all of them are captured on video as Bean shoots everything.Atkinson is a great physical comedian, but not in a pratfall sort of way. He is one to put to use his entire body in emoting and drawing out an idea on screen. Bean is a character who sees the world through child like eyes, who never realizes he's done something wrong until afterwards. And yet this innocence is what makes him so endearing.The idea of an Englishman stuck in France with no ability to speak the language helps rather than hinders the story. The strength of Atkinson's Mr. Bean has always been his physicality rather than wordplay and that strength if given a white canvas on which to paint with this set up.While the laughs might be as funny as some found in the original series, there are plenty on hand. And these are jokes and situations that young and old alike can find something to laugh at.Tolstoy it isn't but if you're looking for something to make you laugh, by all means give Mr. Bean a try. And once you get through this movie, check and see if the local video store has the series on hand as well.

So how would you make a full-length feature film out of a virtually non-verbal man in a speaking environment?  The answer is to send him to a place where language, culture, and environmental factors allow him to interact by his own means.  In other words send him on a vacation from London to Cannes.Although the English dialog left no difficulty for viewers to understand, a change of country made it easier for Bean to fit in.  So in a Borat-like manner he starts off for an adventure that would make even Chevy Chase's Clark Griswold look brilliant.  But unlike either character, Mr. Bean's innocence never varies.That isn't to say that he doesn't wreak havoc along the way.  But even with his crazy antics and expressions, the film's beginning drags until he meets a young boy, about 11, whose father missed his train because he stepped on the platform to take a picture of Bean.  Of course the boy doesn't take to him at first, but they soon become unlikely buddies.  Although even these two become separated, but they somehow reunite, and Bean picks up a third party, a bit-part actress, along the way.So you have a boy in search of his father, an actress in search of a career, and Mr. Bean in search of the ocean.  Naturally the climax occurs at the Cannes film festival where Bean alters an arrogant film-maker's entry, creating the funniest scene in the movie and a happy ending for one in all.

The Odd Couple.What on earth do these wonderful old T.V. shows have to do with Mr. Bean's Holiday?Well, not a whole lot thematically, but there is one very significant tie between them. The classic shows mentioned above were not children's programs. They were prime-time comedy series aimed at adults. They were clean as a whistle for the most part, as shows then tended to be, but the subjects of the shows revolved around divorce, marital troubles, problems at the office etc.Unfortunately, modern entertainment equates ""adult"" with sex and violence. In other words, the word adult has been appropriated. Nothing could possibly be funny, clever, inventive or exciting if there isn't at least some sex or controversy right? It's a pretty sad state when ""adult"" has come to mean ""15 year-old boy"" :/Now before you roll your eyes, I am as far from being a prude as you can get. I own and admire scores of R-rated films, and listen to music that would make most ""hipsters"" hair curl with shock and disgust. But there was a time when writers actually had to be clever to get a laugh, imagine that. Any idiot can walk into a theater full of adolescents, drop the F-bomb and get roars of laughter, and do, now that was easy. The industry has gone from using salatious material to be thought-provoking (Kubrick, Scorsese) to relying on it for an easy thrill.Well just when you thought that the art of being funny without body parts and fart jokes was a lost art, along comes Mr. Bean. Rowan Atkinson reminds us with this funny, charming film, that funny is funny. My 9-year-old roared with delight throughout the entire film, as did my wife and I. And the added kick was, it was the first time in a long, long time we did it as a family, without my wife holding the remote with a death-grip to skip over something. It was a nice, and far-too overdue feeling.Of course there are several references thoughout the movie that will sail over the heads of most children, a scene satirizing a pretentious, arty filmmaker for instance (which was hilarious), but the lion's share of the old, almost silent film-style sight gags and elaborately choreographed Buster Keaton stunts (The amazing walk over a busy highway was pretty impressive), will entertain anyone with a bit of wonder left in them.A previous reviewer believed that today's children would be bored by Mr. Bean's goofy antics. Sadly, these days he may be right. There are no CGI thingies crashing into each other, no underdressed teen girls chatting on cell phones at the mall, and believe it or not, no fart jokes.

Some of the funniest moments ever commited to film can be seen on the series. It's classic british comedy at it's best. However there is something about both Mr. bean films that just seem to fall flat in comparison. Somehow the films just don't seem to work as well. This second Bean film is certainly better than the first, but it never is as good as any of the TV episodes Atkinson made. There are moments in this one however that are truly hysterical, but there just seems to be something missing in these full length features. The obvious first thing that comes to mind is the absence of any studio audience chuckling and belly laughing to Bean's antics. The audience helps set the mood of this sort of comedy. I think the series also works well because of it's short 15 minute to 30 minute segments and it seems to work well that way. It's much more difficult to take a Bean episode and then lengthen one basic story into an 80 minute film and keep the good comedic ideas flowing well. In fact this film was funniest when it paid homage to Bean TV episodes from the past that might be familiar to some of us. The first full length feature was very odd. The way it turned out Bean seemed almost creepy and perverted rather than just innocently wierd. So over all though there were some good moments this film pretty much fails to convey the same classic comedy the original series had.",3,At least he's not creepy like was in the first movie.

Zwick,"[0, 4]","How much you'll enjoy ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" will depend in large part on your tolerance for Rowan Atkninson, a rubber-faced comedian who, with his broad physical humor and near-wordless pantomime, harkens back - in style if not in quality - to the silent greats like Chaplin, Keaton, Langdon, etc.In this installment, the British Mr. Bean wins the top prize in a local raffle - an all-expenses-paid trip to the French Riviera.  The movie chronicles the havoc he leaves in his wake both on the way to his destination and in the South of France itself, culminating in a major ruckus at the Cannes Film Festival, no less (this is the best part of the movie, actually).The problem is that none of it really plays very well as comedy.  After what feels like the longest credit sequence in motion picture history, Mr. Bean launches into a French restaurant bit that Lucille Ball had already done to perfection fifty years earlier.  Things don't get much better from that point on, as Bean races from one pratfall-ridden disaster to another throughout the course of the movie.  And, when all else fails, the filmmakers throw a hapless youngster - a boy who gets accidentally separated from his father at a train station - into the mix to turn this into Atkinson's own version of ""The Kid.""Mr. Bean may be funny to some, but to me he's just annoying and creepy - the visual equivalent of nails on a chalkboard perhaps.  The grunting and groaning and monosyllabic muttering become unendurable over time, and the constant facial twitching and mugging for the camera don't do much to endear us to the character - or to the performer, for that matter - either.As a source of laughter, this Bean character is certainly an acquired taste and I'm perfectly willing to concede that there is something in all this labored farce that I simply don`t relate to.

There were quite a few Chinese students on the plane. It was amazing how this little Englishman had those people nearly falling out of their seats laughing. Two Chinese men sitting beside me were nearly crying from laughter.I have to say this comedy was far better than the American crap I had to watch going over (License to Wed, Evan Almighty, Knocked up. )I didn't hear any out loud laughter from any of those.The great thing about Mr. Bean movies is the subtlety (sometimes) of the comedy. Mr. Bean is a one-man demolition derby whose actions start a cascade of destruction and chaos that he himself is completely OBLIVIOUS to!

Mr. Bean has no idea what he's started.The other hilarious scene was when he was locked in the little outhouse building on the side of the road. The only way to get out is to get hit by a truck. This was not shown. He carried the building out of scene onto the highway. You hear a huge truck's horn, then a tremendous crash, wood flying. Leaving it to our imaginations was far funnier than seeing the explosion. Atkinson's comedic secret is he gets into little stupid things that we ourselves get into, but hope no one's around to see it. There's  no projectile vomiting or extreme toilet humor that American comedy writers (I use that term loosely) stoop to incessantly.However, I wish there'd been more scenes like this.

1110914,A3B87UZLPCF0HW,B000WOQKCQ,"Tanis ""Tanis Yvonne Somerville""","[1, 5]","The long-awaited second Bean movie, Mr. Bean's Holiday, has a running time of only 83 minutes -- or about 80 minutes too long, as one wag put it at the screening we attended.One is either a fan of Mr. Bean or one is not, and as actor Rowan Atkinson himself has pointed out, Bean is not a favourite of critics because the humour is too simple. Something like that, anyway.In Mr. Bean's Holiday, our hero wins a contest and his prize is a trip to Cannes. Whatever can go wrong on his travels does go wrong; he is taken for a child abductor, among other problems, and he wanders through the landscape with a Russian child in tow, having mistakenly separated the child from his father. Mr. Bean's misadventures are many.He loses his tickets and passport, gets tossed off a train, chases chickens (don't ask) gets locked in a shed, rides a bike, wanders into the filming of an advertisement and sabotages a movie screening at Cannes.There are a handful of very funny moments in the movie, most of them dedicated to making fun of pretentious movies and their filmmakers (represented by Willem Dafoe.)Mr. Bean's holiday footage gets inserted into Dafoe's ridiculous film, to great comic effect. The sequences in Cannes are mostly amusing, and Mr. Bean even gets to meet a girl: Sabine (Emma de Caunes). His amateur filmmaking helps make her a star.Mostly, though, Bean mugs and grunts for the camera, and very quickly it all wears thin.",3,"Funny at times, but not what I expected.....",1188518400,"08 31, 2007",2007,1429,"['long-awaited', 'second', 'Bean', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'Holiday', 'running', 'time', 'only', '83', 'minutes', '80', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'one', 'put', 'screening', 'attended.One', 'fan', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'one', 'not', 'actor', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'pointed', 'out', 'Bean', 'not', 'favourite', 'critics', 'humour', 'too', 'simple', 'Something', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'Holiday', 'hero', 'contest', 'prize', 'trip', 'Cannes', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'travels', 'go', 'wrong', 'taken', 'child', 'abductor', 'other', 'problems', 'landscape', 'Russian', 'child', 'tow', 'having', 'mistakenly', 'separated', 'child', 'father', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'misadventures', 'are', 'many.He', 'tickets', 'passport', 'tossed', 'off', 'train', 'chickens', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'locked', 'shed', 'bike', 'wanders', 'filming', 'advertisement', 'movie', 'screening', 'Cannes.There', 'are', 'handful', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'movie', 'most', 'dedicated', 'making', 'fun', 'pretentious', 'movies', 'filmmakers', 'represented', 'Willem', 'Dafoe.', 'Mr', 'Bean', 'holiday', 'footage', 'inserted', 'Dafoe', 'ridiculous', 'film', 'great', 'comic', 'effect', 'sequences', 'Cannes', 'are', 'mostly', 'amusing', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'even', 'meet', 'girl', 'Sabine', 'Emma', 'de', 'Caunes', 'amateur', 'filmmaking', 'helps', 'make', 'star.Mostly', 'Bean', 'mugs', 'grunts', 'camera', 'very', 'quickly', 'wears', 'thin']",N/A

Mr. Bean, whom Atkinson describes as a child in a grown man's body, was created when Atkinson was a student at Oxford University.Borrowing from silent film techniques, Bean never speaks, relying instead on facial expressions, sight gags, and slapstick to milk laughs.  Atkinson is Chaplinesque in the way he sets up gags, plants them, and then illustrates his mortification at how badly things have gone.  We feel sorry for his sad-sack ineptness, but still manage to laugh at his constant penchant for getting into awkward, frequently embarrassing fixes. I was reminded of Buster Keaton and even Lucille Ball, two folks who knew how to incorporate and use props comically.  Atkinson cites Jacques Tati's earlier character, Mr. Hulot, as another influence.The box set contains all fourteen episodes of the original series and the two feature films, ""Bean: The Movie"" and ""Mr. Bean's Holiday.""  In addition, the set contains the animated series ""It's Not Easy Being Bean"" and ""Bean There, Done That.""Bonus features include deleted scenes, never-before-seen-on-TV sketches, the documentary ""The Story of Bean,""  the 20-minute featurette ""Making of the Animated Series, a music video, and French versions of the feature films.",4,Paradise for Mr. Bean Fans,1230422400,"12 28, 2008",2008,1426,"['Mr.', 'Bean', 'Ultimate', 'Collection', 'seven-disc', 'box', 'set', 'featuring', 'antics', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'alter-', 'ego', 'long-legged', 'goofy-looking', 'guy', 'who', 'create', 'comic', 'mayhem', 'wherever', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'whom', 'Atkinson', 'child', 'grown', 'man', 'body', 'was', 'created', 'when', 'Atkinson', 'was', 'student', 'Oxford', 'University.Borrowing', 'silent', 'film', 'techniques', 'Bean', 'never', 'relying', 'instead', 'facial', 'expressions', 'sight', 'gags', 'slapstick', 'milk', 'laughs', 'Atkinson', 'Chaplinesque', 'way', 'up', 'gags', 'plants', 'then', 'mortification', 'how', 'badly', 'things', 'have', 'gone', 'feel', 'sorry', 'sad-sack', 'ineptness', 'still', 'manage', 'laugh', 'constant', 'penchant', 'getting', 'awkward', 'frequently', 'embarrassing', 'fixes', 'was', 'reminded', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'even', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'two', 'folks', 'who', 'knew', 'how', 'incorporate', 'use', 'props', 'comically', 'Atkinson', 'Jacques', 'Tati', 'earlier', 'character', 'Mr.', 'Hulot', 'influence.The', 'box', 'set', 'fourteen', 'episodes', 'original', 'series', 'two', 'feature', 'films', 'Bean', 'Movie', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'Holiday', 'addition', 'set', 'animated', 'series', 'Not', 'Easy', 'Being', 'Bean', 'Bean', 'Done', 'That', 'Bonus', 'features', 'include', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'never-before-seen-on-TV', 'sketches', 'documentary', 'Story', 'Bean', '20-minute', 'featurette', 'Making', 'Animated', 'Series', 'music', 'video', 'French', 'versions', 'feature', 'films']",N/A
1110917,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000WOQKCQ,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[11, 35]","I am a huge fan of the British Television series ""Mr. Bean"", created by Rowan Atkinson and Richard Curtis (who would go on to write ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and write and direct ""Love, Actually). The series, available on DVD and shown on PBS stations from time to time, follows the adventures of Mr. Bean (Atkinson), a largely silent, slightly bitter, single British man, who finds himself in various predicaments. Because the character is largely silent, he gets into a variety of situations leading to a lot of physical comedy. And he is largely reminiscent of great comedians like Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton.A few years ago, they made a film called simply ""Bean"", which was released in Europe before it came to the United States. A huge hit, the film was scheduled for release in later summer here in America and quickly flopped. It's easy to see why the character is such a draw in Europe; because he almost never speaks, it isn't a lot of work to translate his dialogue for foreign countries. Everyone understands physical humor. ""Bean"" was a dreadful film. The story quickly builds a pretense of getting the character to Los Angeles where he interacts with his host family and their two `adorable' kids and Burt Reynolds plays a supporting role. The film chose to replay a number of situations from the series and added two kids, who could, presumably, relate to the overgrown child in Bean. It didn't work.When I first saw the trailer for ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"", the newest film featuring the Rowan Atkinson creation, I was intrigued. It seemed to be a thinly veiled re-working of the Jacques Tati classic ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" with the Bean character taking the place of Mr. Hulot. Jacques Tati's films are also significant for their sparing use of dialogue and it seemed like the translation might lead to more success.I was very nave.""Holiday"" starts promisingly. Bean (Atkinson) speeds his little Mini Cooper to a broken down church barely making the announcement of the winner of their big raffle. As it is June in England, the torrential rain is dampening everyone's sprits and Bean is especially eager to win an expense paid trip to the sunny beaches of Cannes. He wins and he has a couple of amusing moments at the beginning of the journey. After he arrives in Paris, and finds the train to Cannes, he asks a gentleman to take some video of him boarding the train. The gentleman misses the train and Bean soon realizes the man's young son has been left behind on the train. Bean realizes he has to help reunite them and they set off on a trip across France, trying to get to Cannes. Along the way, they cross paths with an American film director (Willem Dafoe) who is also on his way to the Cannes Film Festival and the young French actress (Emma de Caunes) he is courting.""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" misfires on just about every count. Even the amusing situations he gets involved in on the train to Paris, at the beginning of his journey, are just that, amusing. They aren't so funny you will forever remember them forever, or so funny they redeem the film, they only manage to create a smile. The best of these is when Bean wanders into a restaurant at Gare Du Lyon, because he has some time to kill before taking the train to Cannes, he decides to eat a meal. He inadvertently orders a Platter Fruit De Mer from the Maitre' D (Jean Rochefort, ""The Man on the Train"") and is shocked to find a huge platter of oysters and large prawns, complete with eyes, delivered to his table. Atkinson is a gifted comedian with an extremely expressive face and we instantly feel his pain when he eats his first raw oyster.But this same gifted comedian can't help make other scenes more than slightly amusing. For instance, he tires to amuse the boy on the train by pasting pieces of paper on his eyelids and tongue and make them move around. This is just creepy. Later, he interrupts a screening of a film at the Cannes Film Festival in a protracted bit of unfunny business, which points to a very obvious joke.Why do these films fall so flat? It seems a shame they attempt to make these films appeals to such a broad audience. In each, Bean is paired with precocious children in a blatant attempt to both appeal to this demographic and point out the obvious comparisons between Bean's character and the children. ""Holiday"" is rated G because it contains nothing that could be considered even slightly racy or daring. But I think little kids will be bored by Bean's relatively low-key antics.One of the great things about the show is Bean was usually a little bitter about how put upon he felt. He felt entitled to certain things and when he didn't get them, he became slightly exasperated. In the films, the attempts to make him universally appealing have robbed him of this aspect of his character and simply serve to make him boring.There are two very funny moments in ""Holiday"". At one point, Bean begins to karaoke or pantomime to an aria from an opera as people walking through a French market stop to watch. Later, Willem Dafoe's American director premieres his latest film at the Cannes Film Festival and we get to see snippets of the overly pretentious piece of crap he has created and is so clearly in love with.But these moments are few and far between and it takes a long time to get there and a long time after they happen until the film finally ends. When the film does finally end, you feel a sense of relief. You no longer need to wait, hoping something, anything funny might happen. Sure, it is a wait in vain, but you never give up hope.""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" isn't funny enough, amusing enough or clever enough to warrant your money or time. That's sad because Rowan Atkinson is a very funny guy and Mr. Bean has provided some hilarious moments on his television series.

Though Atkinson did an animated series of Bean 2002-03, ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" should be called the character's real comeback since the feature film in 1997, but I am afraid 10 years are too long for most of us.""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" - the title is a reference to Jacque Tati's masterpiece ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" - is a series of comic sketches. These sketches are loosely tied together in a thin storyline about Mr. Bean who wins a ticket to Cannes and intends to see the beach no matter what happens on his way. It is partly a road movie that also involves a Russian kid, a French actress and a bicycle. Yes, it's Jacque Tati.Though there are funny sight gags and clever jokes (Jean Rochefort eating a hamburger, or Willem Dafoe playing an egomaniac director, for example), some people might find these comic sketches not as funny as they should. I think I can understand their complaints (especially when they are avid fans of the original TV series) when these gags are done in a rather slack pace, or have been done somewhere else in a better form. You just don't find a tightly-constructed, ingenious script of the TV episodes, where funny things keep happening in the most unexpected way. I was not disappointed with the film very much, but I know ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" is not the best of the Bean franchise.Actually Rowan Atkinson did much funnier sketches on stage or in ""Blackadder"" and ""The Thin Blue Line.""

1110921,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000WOQKCQ,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","Taking place ten years after BEAN THE MOVIE, Rowan Atkinson returns to portray Mr. Bean one final time in MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY (Atkinson announced that this MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY would be the last story that he would do as Mr. Bean). The movie opens with Mr. Bean rushing to attend a charity auction and raffle. It's the big day of the big raffle and the big prize is an all-expense paid trip to the beaches at Cannes, France. Mr. Bean ends up winning the trip and is giddy as a school boy. Bean accidently takes a taxi and is dropped off at the wrong location. Using his trusty compass, he walks all the way back to the train station. While there he has an hour to wait until his next train arrives and he gets into some mischief in a restaurant. Bean eventually gets on the train and finds himself in the company of a Russian boy. He and his father were inadvertently separated at the station due to Mr. Bean. Much of the rest of the movie involves Mr. Bean trying to get the boy back to his father and make it to Cannes. Along the way he mimes Puccini's O mio babbiono caro to earn money; beats some Tour de France bicycle riders; works as an extra in big budget movie; meets a beautiful actress; and happens to become a hit at the Cannes film festival.MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY is a far better film than BEAN THE MOVIE. BEAN THE MOVIE seemed to be more focused on tying a bunch of Mr. Bean sketches together in one film and then arranging the story around those sketches. Although there are several Bean bits (both old and new) in MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY, MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY seems to have been written as a story first and then had the bits added along the way. MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY is just a far better story and one with a whole bunch more heart than BEAN THE MOVIE. There are some really funny parts (such as Mr. Bean trying to eat unshelled scampi or miming opera), but the movie also has a real tenderness to it. Mr. Bean really just wants to get to the beach, but he's also protective of the Russian boy he travels with. In some ways, MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY is the story of when Mr. Bean began to grow up.Overall, MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY is a very funny, heart-felt movie. It's a far better film than BEAN THE MOVIE and is a fine way for Mr. Bean to say farewell.",4,Goodbye Mr. Bean,1394841600,"03 15, 2014",2014,2245,"['Taking', 'place', 'ten', 'years', 'BEAN', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'portray', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'one', 'final', 'time', 'MR.', 'BEAN', 'HOLIDAY', 'Atkinson', 'announced', 'MR.', 'BEAN', 'HOLIDAY', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'story', 'would', 'do', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'rushing', 'attend', 'charity', 'auction', 'raffle', 'big', 'day', 'big', 'raffle', 'big', 'prize', 'all-expense', 'paid', 'trip', 'beaches', 'Cannes', 'France', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'up', 'winning', 'trip', 'giddy', 'school', 'boy', 'Bean', 'accidently', 'taxi', 'dropped', 'off', 'wrong', 'location', 'Using', 'trusty', 'compass', 'way', 'back', 'train', 'station', 'hour', 'wait', 'next', 'train', 'arrives', 'mischief', 'restaurant', 'Bean', 'eventually', 'train', 'company', 'Russian', 'boy', 'father', 'were', 'inadvertently', 'separated', 'station', 'due', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'Much', 'rest', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'trying', 'get', 'boy', 'back', 'father', 'make', 'Cannes', 'way', 'Puccini', 'O', 'mio', 'babbiono', 'caro', 'earn', 'money', 'Tour', 'de', 'France', 'bicycle', 'riders', 'extra', 'big', 'budget', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'become', 'hit', 'Cannes', 'film', 'festival.MR', 'BEAN', 'HOLIDAY', 'far', 'better', 'film', 'BEAN', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'BEAN', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'focused', 'tying', 'bunch', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'together', 'one', 'film', 'then', 'arranging', 'story', 'sketches', 'are', 'several', 'Bean', 'bits', 'old', 'new', 'MR.', 'BEAN', 'HOLIDAY', 'MR.', 'BEAN', 'HOLIDAY', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'story', 'first', 'then', 'had', 'bits', 'added', 'way', 'MR.', 'BEAN', 'HOLIDAY', 'just', 'far', 'better', 'story', 'one', 'whole', 'bunch', 'more', 'heart', 'BEAN', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'are', 'really', 'funny', 'parts', 'such', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'trying', 'eat', 'unshelled', 'scampi', 'miming', 'opera', 'movie', 'also', 'real', 'tenderness', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'really', 'just', 'get', 'beach', 'also', 'protective', 'Russian', 'boy', 'ways', 'MR.', 'BEAN', 'HOLIDAY', 'story', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'began', 'grow', 'up.Overall', 'MR.', 'BEAN', 'HOLIDAY', 'very', 'funny', 'heart-felt', 'movie', 'far', 'better', 'film', 'BEAN', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'fine', 'way', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'say', 'farewell']",N/A

We meet an older, mellower Bean, without the moments of petty selfishness that brought an edge to his television shows.However, even Mr. Atkinson could not weave an hour and a half of Bean sketches together without help.  His traveling companions carry the film from one moment of Bean mania to the next.  Young Max Baldry is brilliant as the lost child who can relate to Mr. Bean on his own level.  The audience is never certain who is rescuing whom.  Emma de Caunes is enchanting and provides an apt foil as the trusting starlet who befriends the hapless Bean.  I will watch this one again just to bask in her smile!The story comes to a hilarious and satisfying conclusion as all the lives Bean has touched on his journey come together.It might sound crazy for a film that's mostly mime, but you might want to watch this one with the subtitles on.  After all, most of the people are speaking French, the lost boy and his father speak Russian, and it's easy to miss some of the background humor if you're not a linguist.",5,"Gracias, Mr. Bean",1238630400,"04 2, 2009",2009,1085,"['Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'cake', 'charming', 'film', 'meet', 'older', 'mellower', 'Bean', 'moments', 'petty', 'selfishness', 'brought', 'edge', 'television', 'shows.However', 'even', 'Mr.', 'Atkinson', 'could', 'not', 'weave', 'hour', 'half', 'Bean', 'sketches', 'together', 'help', 'traveling', 'companions', 'carry', 'film', 'one', 'moment', 'Bean', 'mania', 'next', 'Young', 'Max', 'Baldry', 'brilliant', 'lost', 'child', 'who', 'can', 'relate', 'Mr.', 'Bean', 'own', 'level', 'audience', 'never', 'certain', 'who', 'rescuing', 'whom', 'Emma', 'Caunes', 'enchanting', 'apt', 'foil', 'trusting', 'starlet', 'who', 'hapless', 'Bean', 'will', 'watch', 'one', 'again', 'just', 'bask', 'smile', 'story', 'hilarious', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'lives', 'Bean', 'touched', 'journey', 'come', 'together.It', 'might', 'sound', 'crazy', 'film', 'mostly', 'mime', 'might', 'want', 'watch', 'one', 'subtitles', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'speaking', 'French', 'lost', 'boy', 'father', 'speak', 'Russian', 'easy', 'miss', 'background', 'humor', ""'re"", 'not', 'linguist']",N/A

You can take your saintly aunt Jemima to this one, and you need not fear to let your children, or grandchildren view it either.  It is a G and deserves the rating; there is literally nothing in it that is in any way objectionable.  Why can't other films accomplish this?When my wife and I went to see ""Mr Bean's Holiday"" it was pouring down with rain outside.  It was the first day of school too.  Maybe that was the reason why there were only six in the movie theater to see this gem?  We were three couples, yet for all the small number there was regular, hearty laughter throughout  the whole performance.I don't know why some reviewers found it uneven or disappointing.  It managed to have a lot of brand new material in it.  The on-location European filming gave added interest.  We never lost  track of the plot or lost interest in the action.We're ordering one for ourselves (the wife and I) and one for the biggest of Bean fans among our grandchildren.By the way every one of more than a dozen grandchildren has been absolutely delighted with Mr Bean and have asked to see the episodes from the TV series again and again, as well as the movie ""Bean"".
