1182360,AH4SL0YL5AQVU,B001DN0V02,Alric the Red,"[2, 2]","The film opens on a winter afternoon, with a high-school band practicing on a marching field.  Gunshots shatter the tranquility of the township, and the scene fades to black.  Subtitles inform us that we've leapt back to ""several weeks earlier,"" to a period in which all of the adult relationships in this story are already broken.  The central relationship and the source of the greatest tension is between Annie Marchand (Kate Beckinsale) and her estranged husband Glenn (Sam Rockwell).  Annie is living in a perpetual state of responding to the needs of those around her, barely aware of herself as at an emotional brink.  In a misdirected attempt to get a slice of life for herself, she's having an unfulfilling affair with a married man.  Her husband Glenn meanwhile refuses to accept the dissolution of his marriage, and skulks in her emotional shadow.  He tells his daughter when he has visitations to remind mommy he's changed.  In the past he'd been more demanding, so at this stage of the story he has a restraining order against him.Beckinsale nails it as a woman beleaguered in every direction.  Rockwell delivers a compelling performance as a man with no place to turn but his idealized past with Annie.  Hoping to amend himself, he takes up religion, but his crude faith is challenged beyond his wisdom by his sense of abject failure.  Containing his desperation behind a rigid courtesy, he blandishes Annie with claims that he's a new man, redoubling his efforts to reclaim his happiness, while desperation drags him deeper into frustration and despair, a downward spiral.  Confused by her own kindness, she wishes to ease his suffering, but nevertheless understands on a less emotional level that it would be at the expense of her own happiness.  Then a terrible tragedy strikes.This is great drama, with vivid performances by the entire cast.  What makes it more compelling is the memory of those gunshots at the very beginning of the film.  As the events unfold, the tension is ratcheted by our foreknowledge of a terrible ending.  But for whom?  You think you know, but as the story develops it's less certain, so you're drawn in closer, making it doubly wrenching to watch decent people unravel.  These are lives too burdened with the plain ritual of necessity, enduring too much disappointment, everyone squirming in diminishing hopes.  If there's a moral here, perhaps it's that there are no happy endings; only happy beginnings, as in the new love of the teenagers in the marching band.  It's a haunting story because the drama is realistic, a bleak landscape in the dead of winter._________________________________________",4,Intense Emotional Drama,1231286400,"01 7, 2009",2009,2646,"['film', 'winter', 'afternoon', 'high-school', 'band', 'practicing', 'marching', 'field', 'Gunshots', 'shatter', 'tranquility', 'township', 'scene', 'black', 'Subtitles', 'inform', ""'ve"", 'leapt', 'back', 'several', 'weeks', 'earlier', 'period', 'adult', 'relationships', 'story', 'are', 'already', 'broken', 'central', 'relationship', 'source', 'greatest', 'tension', 'Annie', 'Marchand', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'estranged', 'husband', 'Glenn', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Annie', 'living', 'perpetual', 'state', 'responding', 'needs', 'barely', 'aware', 'herself', 'emotional', 'brink', 'misdirected', 'attempt', 'get', 'slice', 'life', 'herself', 'having', 'unfulfilling', 'affair', 'married', 'man', 'husband', 'Glenn', 'meanwhile', 'accept', 'dissolution', 'marriage', 'skulks', 'emotional', 'shadow', 'daughter', 'when', 'visitations', 'remind', 'mommy', 'changed', 'past', ""'d"", 'been', 'more', 'demanding', 'so', 'stage', 'story', 'restraining', 'order', 'him.Beckinsale', 'nails', 'woman', 'beleaguered', 'direction', 'Rockwell', 'compelling', 'performance', 'man', 'place', 'turn', 'idealized', 'past', 'Annie', 'Hoping', 'amend', 'up', 'religion', 'crude', 'faith', 'challenged', 'wisdom', 'sense', 'abject', 'failure', 'Containing', 'desperation', 'rigid', 'courtesy', 'Annie', 'claims', 'new', 'man', 'redoubling', 'efforts', 'reclaim', 'happiness', 'desperation', 'deeper', 'frustration', 'despair', 'downward', 'spiral', 'Confused', 'own', 'kindness', 'ease', 'suffering', 'nevertheless', 'understands', 'less', 'emotional', 'level', 'would', 'be', 'expense', 'own', 'happiness', 'Then', 'terrible', 'tragedy', 'strikes.This', 'great', 'drama', 'vivid', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'What', 'more', 'compelling', 'memory', 'gunshots', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'events', 'unfold', 'tension', 'ratcheted', 'foreknowledge', 'terrible', 'ending', 'whom', 'think', 'know', 'story', 'less', 'certain', ""'re"", 'drawn', 'closer', 'making', 'doubly', 'wrenching', 'watch', 'decent', 'people', 'unravel', 'are', 'lives', 'too', 'burdened', 'plain', 'ritual', 'necessity', 'enduring', 'too', 'much', 'disappointment', 'everyone', 'squirming', 'diminishing', 'hopes', 'moral', 'here', 'perhaps', 'are', 'happy', 'endings', 'only', 'happy', 'beginnings', 'new', 'love', 'teenagers', 'marching', 'band', 'haunting', 'story', 'drama', 'realistic', 'bleak', 'landscape', 'dead', 'winter._________________________________________']",N/A

All of the performances are outstanding but Sam Rockwell clearly surpassed the others as a man who found God after he tried to commit suicide.

Any rational person in the position of  16 or 17-year old Arthur would have good cause to have second thoughts about romance.  And, all this horrible stuff around him is happening as he tries to experience his first romance.  I could have been a good lesson that adults have their problems with their marriages (just as one does as a teen just starting out in love), but that they can be solved.  The movie would still have had merit if some of the situations were resolved positively.My big, unforgivable, complaint with the movie is that the one who is made out to be an Evangelical Christian turns out to be the most evil person in the bunch.  As millions can testify, there is nothing in Christianity that even remotely predisposes a person to evil; it is the other way around.  [There are examples of those who are deeply evil try to use Christianity as a cover.  But, those people don't get down on their knees in the privacy of their rooms, as was shown in this movie.]  Any bad language or sexuality are of very minor importance in the film.So, what might have been a good story is marred by excessively depressive events.  This is amplified by a total misrepresentation of Christianity.  If you want to have a nice evening bringing on or amplifying 'the blues' this might be the movie for you.  The only positive note is that, in spite of all the negativity around him, Arthur seemed to be making progress with his new girlfriend (with her doing most of the 'helping along').

1182371,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001DN0V02,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","SNOW ANGELS is a tough movie from a tough novel by Stewart O'Nan, an author who continues to explore the darker corners of everyday people's lives without necessarily offering a path of redemption for the found flaws.  Director David Gordon Green has adapted O'Nan's fine book for the screen, made some odd choices in the narrative line, but manages to maintain the pervasive sad and almost hopeless atmosphere of a little Pennsylvania town in the winter that is besieged by events that bruise the lives of many people.Arthur (Michael Angarano, who continues to impress with superb acting) is a high school kid, working as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant where his 'dream girl' (ex-babysitter)  Annie (Kate Beckinsale) and Annie's best friend Barb (Amy Sedaris) wait tables, filling his spare time playing trombone in the high school band, and enduring the crumbling marriage of his mother (Jeanette Arnette) and teacher father (Griffin Dunne). Each of the characters we meet has baggage: Annie is separated from her ne're-do-well loser husband Glenn (Sam Rockwell) who haunts her with his desire to see his little daughter Tara while the confused Annie is having an affair with Nate (Nicky Katt), a male nurse,  who just happens to be married to Barb. Though Arthur maintains his fascination and puppy love for Annie, he is drawn into the adult world by his fellow student Lila (Olivia Thirlby) who becomes Arthur's first 'romance' and physical experience.  As Arthur attempts to form an adult outlook on relationships with Lila, the world in this tiny town becomes increasingly fragile. Little Tara strays from home only to be discovered during the resultant manhunt by Arthur who finds the child frozen in the lake.  This tragedy  only adds to Arthur's own tenuous coping with becoming an adult, and how Glenn and Annie deal with loss results in a profoundly sad ending that is accompanied by the incidental music of the high school band performing on a winter field in this place where things just happen.There is little to add light to the story, except that the performances by each of the actors are exceptionally fine.  Director Green manages to create a fine ensemble feeling from these actors and while there are few characters with whom we can consistently empathize, Green manages to draw well-focused small town folk who remain in the mind long after the film is ended.  Not a happy film, but a solid one.

While it was not as depressing as his second-person novelA Prayer for the Dyingabout the plague hitting a small town, I remember it as a very sad story.  David Gordon Green whose film ""George Washington"" won Best First Film honor from the New York Film Critics Circle has adapted this to the screen.  The juxtaposition of the small town normalcy of football and band practice to the personal conflicts and violence creates a tension that moves the film from quiescence to explosion.Kate Beckinsale who was inLaurel CanyonandUnderworld (Widescreen Special Edition)plays Annie, a young mother who is separated from her husband, having an affair with her best friend's husband and working in a Chinese restaurant.  She flirts with Arthur who is in high school.  While Beckinsale goes to the extremes of the emotional terrain demanded of her, it is her flawed character which alienates the viewer, leaving no good person for whom to root.Sam Rockwell plays her unstable husband Glenn who loves his wife so much that he tried to commit suicide.  Rockwell's character is quite different from the cool character in the quirky masterpiece ""Lawn Dogs"" and the villain in ""Charlie's Angels.""  Rockwell won the Silver Bear Award for Best Actor from the Berlin International Film Festival in 2003 for ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.""  Rockwell literally blows out the windows with a blockbuster performance of a man on an emotional precipice.  Even at the end, it's hard to accurately tell if it's the event with his daughter or his grief over his marriage's breakup that sends him over the edge.Arthur Parkinson is a high school student whose father has left his mother for a younger woman.  Arthur is played by Michael Angarano who was in ""Almost Famous"" in 2000; and is one of the brightest spots in the film.  The new girl in school is Lila who wears pointy glasses and takes photographs before her family moves yet again.  Olivia Thirlby who was inJuno (Single-Disc Edition)does a good job as Lila who shyly sparks romance with Arthur.  Jeanetta Arnette who was in the interesting filmThe Shipping Newsplays Arthur's mother who is glad her son has a social life.  Griffin Dunne who has directed ""Practical Magic"" plays Arthur's dad Don Parkinson who leaves the family for another woman.  Young Grace Hudson has a nice child cameo as Glenn & Annie's daughter Tara.  Nicky Katt does a nice job as the tattooed Nate who has an affair with Annie.One of the themes of the film was disturbing.  Glenn spouts Christian rhetoric as proof of his rehabilitation before breaking one of the Ten Commandments.  However, nowhere is a deep faith-based spirituality shown in any other character.  Instead, it's all like shallow water similar to Tara's resting place.  As the film spirals to its conclusion, there isn't any force trying to prevent the violence.  Overall, as sad as ""Snow Angels"" was, the performances were affecting & the pacing on the film was excellent.

Thomas ""LibraryFiend""","[4, 4]","If you enjoy drama that does more than tear at the heartstrings--the kind that virtually eviscerates you at the very core of your soul--then you are in for an intensely emotional treat with 2007's Snow Angels.Based on the eponymous novel by Stewart O'Nan, Snow Angels takes place in an unnamed northern state where, unsurprisingly, there is frozen precipitation aplenty. The protagonist is young Arthur Parkinson, played to clueless perfection by Michael Anganaro (whom I recognized as having played Elliott, Jack McFarland's son, on Will & Grace). Arthur is a high school student, a tuba player in the band, and an employee of his hometown's Chinese restaurant, owned by Oskar, who is decidedly not Chinese (I think he is supposed to be German).Arthur's parents (Don, played by Griffin Dunne, and Louise, played by Jeanetta Arnette) are separating and his mother is an emotional whirlwind in the face of his professor father's egress. At work, Arthur flirts harmlessly with Annie Marchand (Kate Beckinsale in the most poignant role of her career), a waitress who spent many years babysitting young Arthur. Annie is estranged from her husband, Glenn (a blowout performance by Sam Rockwell), who has recently attempted suicide in the face of his marital woes. They have one child, four-year-old Tara, both adeptly and adorably rendered by Gracie Hudson.New girl in school Lila Raybern takes an instant liking to Arthur; the role is handled admirably by Olivia Thirlby, who played Juno's best friend in the popular film of the same name. Lila, with her engaging chatter and delightfully retro cats'-eye glasses, waits patiently for Arthur to realize she has a significant crush on him.A second couple, Nate and Barb Petite, find their lives hopelessly interlocked with those of Glenn and Annie. Barb, played by comedienne Amy Sedaris in an uncharacteristic dramatic role, is a fellow waitress at the Chinese eatery; Nate (played by Nicky Katt) is conducting an adulterous affair with Annie. Meanwhile, Glenn has become a rabidly born-again Christian and is busily attempting to rebuild his life by finding employment while living with his parents and aged grandfather (and let's not forget the dog, Bomber).Suspicions fly and secrets are revealed in the ugliest possible scenarios, all of which find climax when an unthinkable tragedy befalls one of the cast and, as a result, several of the characters become lost completely.I will advise that this movie is incredibly dark and extremely depressing, so be forewarned. Beckinsale and Rockwell, however, deliver stellar performances, and while the film may not be all sweetness and light, I would still highly recommend going out and visiting with these Snow Angels.",4,FALLEN ANGELS OF WINTER,1237939200,"03 25, 2009",2009,2713,"['enjoy', 'drama', 'more', 'tear', 'heartstrings', 'kind', 'virtually', 'very', 'core', 'soul', 'then', 'are', 'intensely', 'emotional', 'treat', '2007', 'Snow', 'Angels.Based', 'eponymous', 'novel', 'Stewart', ""O'Nan"", 'Snow', 'Angels', 'place', 'unnamed', 'northern', 'state', 'where', 'unsurprisingly', 'frozen', 'precipitation', 'aplenty', 'protagonist', 'young', 'Arthur', 'Parkinson', 'played', 'clueless', 'perfection', 'Michael', 'Anganaro', 'whom', 'recognized', 'having', 'played', 'Elliott', 'Jack', 'McFarland', 'son', 'Will', 'Grace', 'Arthur', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'tuba', 'player', 'band', 'employee', 'hometown', 'Chinese', 'restaurant', 'owned', 'Oskar', 'who', 'decidedly', 'not', 'Chinese', 'think', 'supposed', 'be', 'German', '.Arthur', 'parents', 'Don', 'played', 'Griffin', 'Dunne', 'Louise', 'played', 'Jeanetta', 'Arnette', 'are', 'separating', 'mother', 'emotional', 'whirlwind', 'face', 'professor', 'father', 'egress', 'work', 'Arthur', 'harmlessly', 'Annie', 'Marchand', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'most', 'poignant', 'role', 'career', 'waitress', 'who', 'spent', 'many', 'years', 'babysitting', 'young', 'Arthur', 'Annie', 'estranged', 'husband', 'Glenn', 'blowout', 'performance', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'who', 'recently', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'face', 'marital', 'woes', 'have', 'one', 'child', 'four-year-old', 'Tara', 'adeptly', 'adorably', 'rendered', 'Gracie', 'Hudson.New', 'girl', 'school', 'Lila', 'Raybern', 'instant', 'liking', 'Arthur', 'role', 'handled', 'admirably', 'Olivia', 'Thirlby', 'who', 'played', 'Juno', 'best', 'friend', 'popular', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'Lila', 'engaging', 'chatter', 'delightfully', 'retro', ""cats'-eye"", 'glasses', 'waits', 'patiently', 'Arthur', 'realize', 'significant', 'crush', 'him.A', 'second', 'couple', 'Nate', 'Barb', 'Petite', 'find', 'lives', 'hopelessly', 'interlocked', 'Glenn', 'Annie', 'Barb', 'played', 'comedienne', 'Amy', 'Sedaris', 'uncharacteristic', 'dramatic', 'role', 'fellow', 'waitress', 'Chinese', 'eatery', 'Nate', 'played', 'Nicky', 'Katt', 'conducting', 'adulterous', 'affair', 'Annie', 'Meanwhile', 'Glenn', 'become', 'rabidly', 'born-again', 'Christian', 'busily', 'attempting', 'rebuild', 'life', 'finding', 'employment', 'living', 'parents', 'aged', 'grandfather', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'dog', 'Bomber', '.Suspicions', 'fly', 'secrets', 'are', 'revealed', 'ugliest', 'possible', 'scenarios', 'find', 'climax', 'when', 'unthinkable', 'tragedy', 'one', 'cast', 'result', 'several', 'characters', 'become', 'lost', 'completely.I', 'will', 'advise', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'dark', 'extremely', 'depressing', 'so', 'be', 'forewarned', 'Beckinsale', 'Rockwell', 'however', 'deliver', 'stellar', 'performances', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'sweetness', 'light', 'would', 'still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'going', 'visiting', 'Snow', 'Angels']",N/A

The footwashing ordinance's true context is a voluntary (not forced at gunpoint) symbolic act of Christians serving one another as Christ served us.Christians are sick and tired of being misrepresented as psychos and other seriously disfunctional characters by Hollywood in its secular anti-Christ agenda, which is always glorifying sin like fornication and adultery and excessive violence instead. (The TV series Caprica is another glaring example).No trite sarcastic review responses please.Let's have the truth about Christians. They follow Jesus Christ, their creator and the one who atoned for their sins on the cross to make eternal life possible for those who accept Jesus as Lord and Saviour.

1182383,AGHZCRWBR9XML,B001DN0V02,"Preferred Customer ""C. Edman""","[1, 1]","This film is something of beauty, of terror, of love, of redemption, and false promises and disappointments. Sam Rockwell(Choke, Moon) plays Annie's(Kate Beckinsale of Underworld awesomeness) estranged husband, trying, hopelessly, to get back with her. It's inferred that Glenn(Rockwell) has just gotten out of either rehab or a mental hospital, I wont give away necessarily why he went there. He is still very much in love with Annie, and wants to be a good, full time father to their young daughter, which Annie isn't very comfortable with. The film has duel story lines, one with Glenn and Annie, and an intersecting one with Arthur and his first ""love"" Lila. Arthur is seventeen, in high school, and facing his parents seemingly inevitable divorce. The scenes with Arthur and Lila are really the heart, soul and hope of this film, where the sad, depressing, and haunting scenes with Glenn are the nightmare of the film. I have seen few other writer/directors who can fully encapsulate both sides of human nature as well as David Gordon Green(Who also makes great comedies, see Pineapple Express, director). This one side, tragedy and absolute loss, juxtaposed with youthful love and hopefulness, that basically gets down to the bare elements of this film. At time terrifying, and at time life-affirming. The beautiful cinematography, and editing, the incredible acting by Sam Rockwell as the deeply disturbed and born again Christian fundamentalist, ranks up there with De Niro's Travis Bickle, in terms of craziness, also the grand acting abilities of Kate Beckinsale, which we rarely get to see because of her type casting and oft critiqued films, here she shows her vulnerable, sad, inflicted and yet trying to hold on side, her strength and beauty still visible and her trying to hold herself, her daughter and her mother together, whilst dealing with Glenn. The film does end in tragedy, but also hope, hope that it'll get better, and that perhaps like a phoenix from the ashes, we'll rise from this tragedy better than before it. This really is an intense, beautiful, and heartbreaking film, one you can rarely still find in America. It'll make you laugh, cry, angered, frustrated, and in the end, you wont know what to do, but sit and ponder all that you've just seen.",5,We're all angels,1310515200,"07 13, 2011",2011,2279,"['film', 'something', 'beauty', 'terror', 'love', 'redemption', 'false', 'promises', 'disappointments', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Choke', 'Moon', 'Annie', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Underworld', 'awesomeness', 'estranged', 'husband', 'trying', 'hopelessly', 'get', 'back', 'inferred', 'Glenn', 'Rockwell', 'just', 'gotten', 'out', 'rehab', 'mental', 'hospital', 'wont', 'give', 'away', 'necessarily', 'why', 'went', 'there', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'Annie', 'be', 'good', 'full', 'time', 'father', 'young', 'daughter', 'Annie', ""n't"", 'very', 'comfortable', 'film', 'duel', 'story', 'lines', 'one', 'Glenn', 'Annie', 'intersecting', 'one', 'Arthur', 'first', 'love', 'Lila', 'Arthur', 'seventeen', 'high', 'school', 'facing', 'parents', 'seemingly', 'inevitable', 'divorce', 'scenes', 'Arthur', 'Lila', 'are', 'really', 'heart', 'soul', 'hope', 'film', 'where', 'sad', 'depressing', 'haunting', 'scenes', 'Glenn', 'are', 'nightmare', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'few', 'other', 'writer/directors', 'who', 'can', 'fully', 'encapsulate', 'sides', 'human', 'nature', 'as', 'well', 'David', 'Gordon', 'Green', 'Who', 'also', 'great', 'comedies', 'see', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'director', 'one', 'side', 'tragedy', 'absolute', 'loss', 'juxtaposed', 'youthful', 'love', 'hopefulness', 'basically', 'down', 'bare', 'elements', 'film', 'time', 'terrifying', 'time', 'life-affirming', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'incredible', 'acting', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'born', 'again', 'Christian', 'fundamentalist', 'De', 'Niro', 'Travis', 'Bickle', 'terms', 'craziness', 'also', 'grand', 'acting', 'abilities', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'rarely', 'get', 'see', 'type', 'casting', 'oft', 'critiqued', 'films', 'here', 'vulnerable', 'sad', 'inflicted', 'yet', 'trying', 'hold', 'side', 'strength', 'beauty', 'still', 'visible', 'trying', 'hold', 'daughter', 'mother', 'together', 'whilst', 'dealing', 'Glenn', 'film', 'end', 'tragedy', 'also', 'hope', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'get', 'better', 'perhaps', 'phoenix', 'ashes', ""'ll"", 'rise', 'tragedy', 'better', 'really', 'intense', 'beautiful', 'heartbreaking', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'rarely', 'still', 'find', 'America', ""'ll"", 'make', 'laugh', 'cry', 'angered', 'frustrated', 'end', 'wont', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'sit', 'ponder', ""'ve"", 'just', 'seen']",N/A

I guess I wanted something lighter.Months passed and I still thought about some scenes in the film.  Long after I forgot the title, I couldn't shake the images and feelings.Now I look forward to watching it again.  If anything I wish it had gone into more depth.Without spoiling anything, I think Rockwell's character depicts that kind of desperate, joyless, religion - all form and no substance - that comes out of court-ordered conversions.  It's the form of Christianity and not the substance, not the change of heart and rebirth in the spirit that comes with true conversions.

As the lives of adults spin out of control, Arthur slowly falls in love with his artsy classmate.Without disclosing more, film shows a powerful pull love has on individuals. Arthur's love redeems his loss of innocence, his parents' love for each other pulls them back together again while his former babysitters' first love leads to a tragedy.Kate Beckinsale is amazing in this film.

1182387,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001DN0V02,Roland E.

The people in both groups already seem profoundly unhappy with their lives, but when an unspeakable disaster occurs, things go from bad to worse for all concerned.""Snow Angels"" features insightful writing, sensitive direction and a profound sense of place and season (it takes place in the deep, dark days of a Midwestern winter, though the film itself was shot in Nova Scotia).

These people are trapped and, with few exceptions, hopeless.  Much has been written about the very sweet teen-aged romance.  It is a nice reminder that good things can happen in the midst of desolation.  Otherwise, the bad things come at you relentlessly - it is one of those movies that may find you yelling at the characters on the screen.  The casting is just about perfect.  I would single out a few actors for special mention, but really everyone is very good.This movie came to my attention because I'm reading Last Night at the Lobster by Stewart O'Nan, the author whose book was adapted for this movie.  Although both pieces deal with working-class America, the tone of LNATL is not nearly so depressing as SA.  It's the difference between being able to cope and having given up.

1182390,A2ZGHESQDCI77M,B001DN0V02,"Shiloh True ""Rabid Reader""","[6, 7]","This is one of the most pathetically sad and depressing dramas that I think I've ever watched.  It was like watching a slow train wreck. As the viewer I just wanted to reach out to these emotionally arrested characters, shake them, and yell---stop it, can't you see you're all self-destructing! But, you can't shake inertia, apathy and depression away, can you. Left unchecked, at its worst, it can make one do terrible things. This is a movie that explores the mind's descent into that Hell.The film takes place in a small Pennsylvania town, where mandatory Prozac in every household might have helped.  In some ways the characters reminded me of the series/book Empire Falls.  If you loved those characters, you will likely enjoy this movie too, but be prepared---this movie is darker...much darker and lacking the humor of EF.The film represents a lot of small town angst; dead end jobs, lack of opportunity and everyone knows your business.  Annie (Kate Beckinsale) married her high school sweetheart Glenn (Sam Rockwell).  After several years together, they've grown apart.  Glenn's ne'er do well behaviors, no doubt, added to the distance between them.  He was having trouble keeping a job and hitting the bottle seemed his only coping strategy.  She viewed him as irresponsible and herself hopelessly tied to a mundane existence, with no way out.  She turns to another, who makes her feel wanted, but he's even less worthy of her time.  Glen strives to reconcile, but continues to do all the wrong things and Annie sets up even tighter boundaries, fueling Glenn's rage and his depression, now verging on psychosis.  The tie between them remains their small daughter.  Annie supervises her visits with Glenn closely, feeling he's too irresponsible to oversee her care.  But, is Annie the most responsible parent?The peripheral characters in this movie are dealing with their own issues, while watching Annie and Glenn self destruct.  The teenager, Arthur(Michael Angarano), experiences some coming-of-age moments that are played out very well, as are his other family relational issues.  It appears that these are the folks that have some growth from observing the towns' favorite couple imploding with depression, in their midst.  But, believe me...the Golden Retriever seemed to be the only character in the movie that was consistently stable and he doesn't remain without despair either.The acting in this movie was absolutely superb---by ALL.  Kate Beckinsale was at her best and Sam Rockwell was riveting.  I'm glad I watched this film just to see these performances.  However, it left me profoundly sad and the little beacons of light that were revealed weren't enough to make up for the pain surrounding the major theme.  I was yearning for some of these characters to find redemption.  But, such is life---I know.Do I recommend this movie?  Absolutely! But, if you're already feeling a little melancholy, it might not be the best time to dive into it.",4,"Vivid, haunting portrayal, of the depths of human despair.",1222128000,"09 23, 2008",2008,2965,"['one', 'most', 'pathetically', 'sad', 'depressing', 'dramas', 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'was', 'watching', 'slow', 'train', 'wreck', 'viewer', 'just', 'wanted', 'reach', 'out', 'emotionally', 'arrested', 'characters', 'shake', 'yell', '-stop', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', ""'re"", 'self-destructing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shake', 'inertia', 'apathy', 'depression', 'away', 'can', 'Left', 'unchecked', 'worst', 'can', 'make', 'one', 'do', 'terrible', 'things', 'movie', 'mind', 'descent', 'Hell.The', 'film', 'place', 'small', 'Pennsylvania', 'town', 'where', 'mandatory', 'Prozac', 'household', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'ways', 'characters', 'reminded', 'series/book', 'Empire', 'Falls', 'loved', 'characters', 'will', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'too', 'be', 'prepared', '-this', 'movie', 'darker', 'much', 'darker', 'lacking', 'humor', 'EF.The', 'film', 'lot', 'small', 'town', 'angst', 'dead', 'end', 'jobs', 'lack', 'opportunity', 'everyone', 'business', 'Annie', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'married', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'Glenn', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'several', 'years', 'together', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'apart', 'Glenn', ""ne'er"", 'do', 'well', 'behaviors', 'doubt', 'added', 'distance', 'was', 'having', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'job', 'hitting', 'bottle', 'seemed', 'only', 'coping', 'strategy', 'viewed', 'irresponsible', 'hopelessly', 'tied', 'mundane', 'existence', 'way', 'out', 'who', 'feel', 'wanted', 'even', 'less', 'worthy', 'time', 'Glen', 'reconcile', 'do', 'wrong', 'things', 'Annie', 'up', 'even', 'tighter', 'boundaries', 'fueling', 'Glenn', 'rage', 'depression', 'now', 'verging', 'psychosis', 'tie', 'small', 'daughter', 'Annie', 'visits', 'Glenn', 'closely', 'feeling', 'too', 'irresponsible', 'oversee', 'care', 'Annie', 'most', 'responsible', 'parent', 'peripheral', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'dealing', 'own', 'issues', 'watching', 'Annie', 'Glenn', 'destruct', 'teenager', 'Arthur', 'Michael', 'Angarano', 'coming-of-age', 'moments', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'are', 'other', 'family', 'relational', 'issues', 'are', 'folks', 'have', 'growth', 'observing', 'towns', 'favorite', 'couple', 'imploding', 'depression', 'midst', 'believe', 'Golden', 'Retriever', 'seemed', 'be', 'only', 'character', 'movie', 'was', 'consistently', 'stable', ""n't"", 'remain', 'despair', 'either.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'was', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'ALL', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'was', 'best', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'was', 'riveting', ""'m"", 'glad', 'watched', 'film', 'just', 'see', 'performances', 'However', 'left', 'profoundly', 'sad', 'little', 'beacons', 'light', 'were', 'revealed', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'pain', 'surrounding', 'major', 'theme', 'was', 'yearning', 'characters', 'find', 'redemption', 'such', 'life', '-I', 'know.Do', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Absolutely', ""'re"", 'already', 'feeling', 'little', 'melancholy', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'time', 'dive']",N/A

1182392,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B001DN0V02,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[34, 45]","David Gordon Green is a bit of a critic's darling. He makes good films, but their hyperrealism makes them a little difficult for me to watch. He first came to the attention of many with ""George Washington"", a very-independent look at some young kids in a very depressed town who come together during one fateful day. With each successive film, Green has earned the accolades of more and more people. He has also captured the attention and the right to work with a larger, more eclectic, more established group of actors. Whether this adds anything to the films is debatable. It could simply be his skill.I have to admit that with each of his new films, I come to appreciate his skill a little more. It isn't necessarily that his films are getting ""More Hollywood"", but they are getting more accessible.And the actors seem to be flocking to him, eager to star in his next film; with ""Snow Angels"", his latest work, he has brought together his most eclectic and perhaps most talented cast yet.Set in an unnamed northern town somewhere were snow seems to be on the ground more often than not, the High School marching band is practicing their formations, and the practice is not going well, to the chagrin of their director, when two shots ring out. Arthur (Michael Angarano, many television and film credits, he played Jack's son on ""Will and Grace"") turns to look and his girlfriend, Lila (Olivia Thirlby, ""Juno"") watches him as he becomes concerned. Flashing backwards an indeterminate amount of time, the film picks up at the beginning. Annie (Kate Beckinsale, her best performance) and Barb (Amy Sedaris, going for the dramatic here) are two friends who work as waitresses in the town's Chinese Restaurant. Arthur also works there as a dishwasher and he clearly has a crush on Annie, his former babysitter. She has problems of her own; juggling life as a single mom, with her job, and a needy, dependent ex-husband, Glenn (Sam Rockwell) a recent born-again Christian who can't seem to get on his feet. He is one of those people who can never seem to make the right decision or do the right thing. He is so convinced he is making the right decisions; getting a new job, spending time with their daughter, that he doesn't realize everyone around him is so miserable, most of which misery is caused by his actions. Annie's life is exceedingly complicated as well, much of which is caused by her own actions. And Arthur has to deal with his parent's latest break-up; his dad (Griffin Dunne) has walked out and taken an apartment near the college where he teaches. Then he meets Lila (Thirlby) who is attracted to him and they start to go out, giving each other friendship and comfort. Then, one day Annie is home sick and she falls asleep. Her young daughter disappears and the entire town begins to search. Things spiral downward from there.The magnificent thing about Green's films, and also, in a way, the drawback, is that he seems to have a great ear for dialogue and a keen eye for detail. He uses both of these skills to make his characters come alive and he lets them do what they would naturally do. This is a great skill for any filmmaker to have and Green has it. But it also makes the films seem realistic, too realistic at times, uncomfortably realistic at times. With this realism comes, on occasion, slower pacing. And this realism doesn't always translate into visual filmmaking. These are some of the issues and troubles I have had with his earlier films.But in ""Snow Angels"", the combination of a dramatic story, great acting and the small town setting make the film seem real enough to be believable, yet also cinematic enough to be watch able.Michael Angarano is very good as the troubled teenager with a crush on his former babysitter. It is interesting to watch him portray this aspect of his character and at the same time show how attracted he is to Lila. Arthur is a pretty typical teenager trapped in a small town, trying to work up the energy to escape and lead a life he has always wanted. His hormones are also raging, so he looks shyly at Annie and seems a little confused by Lila. Lila has to make the first move and practically profess her interest in Arthur, before he realizes something is going on.It is also interesting to watch his relationship with his parents. When we first meet his mom, Louise (Jeanetta Arnette, a popular character actress with many television and film roles to her credit), she appears to be either drunk or have been crying. Her eyes are wide and she looks spaced out. Then you realize, her husband (Griffin Dunne) is leaving and this is the cause of her current state. So, for much of the film, she walks around in a daze, trying to provide a stable home for Arthur. But as we watch Arthur deal with this, Angarano shows us his character has dealt with this problem too many times. We watch as Don begins his new life as a bachelor; he moves into a new apartment, decorated with sparse furniture and spends time exercising on his treadmill, equipment dominating the otherwise sparse room.The relationship between Arthur and Annie is sweet. It is clear he has a crush on her and what is even better is she recognizes this as well, flirting a little with the younger boy. At one point, he is working at the Chinese Restaurant on a busy Saturday night. Annie chides him ""Don't you have anything better to do?"" You get the sense there is nowhere else he would rather be.Then, when he realizes Lila always seems to be hanging around, he starts to talk to her. As their relationship grows, you can almost see the light bulb go off in his head when he realizes she is interested in him. Their relationship is interesting to watch and seems pretty honest and true to how teenagers probably get together in this day and age.I didn't recognize Olivia Thirlby at first, she plays Juno's best friend, the one who helps her break the news to her parents, in the multi-Oscar nominee. In ""Snow Angels"", she plays a slightly bookish looking young lady who is seemingly very attracted to Arthur. Lila seems like what every smart, young woman should strive to be when they are in high school. She is smart, curious, funny, and not afraid to go after what she wants.I have never been a fan of Kate Beckinsale (""Pearl Harbor"", ""Click""). Don't get me wrong, she is a pretty woman. But her acting skills tend to create a vacuum, sucking out all of the life force in the room and leaving her co-stars to tread water as they swim from the sinking ship. In ""Snow Angels"", she appears to have finally met the right combination of director and material. Annie is already stuck in this small town and realizes her chances of escape are pretty slim. A single mom, with a dead end job, she cares for her sick mother and has to deal with her ex-husband, Glenn (Sam Rockwell). She clearly loves her daughter, but her life is a mess and she isn't helping things along by having an affair with Nate (Nicky Katt). When her daughter goes missing, she becomes distraught and is amazed by the show of support from the community. As Beckinsale portrays this characters emotion, we see all of the conflicting emotions running through her head. She yelled at her daughter the day before she disappeared, flying off the handle at the smallest annoyance. She needs to see her again to make it all better. She has done some bad things to her friend Barb (Amy Sedaris), yet she is one of the first people to show up and offer help. It is a very good, very moving performance.Sam Rockwell is also very good as Glenn. From the moment we first meet Glenn, we realize he is one of those people who will always struggle with life. A divorced dad, he now lives with his elderly parents and practically immobile grandfather in his family home. There is a hint that something bad happened recently, beyond the divorce with Annie, and he is starting over. Glenn is a role that could easily have become hammy and over the top and Rockwell manages to make him believable and interesting. He walks a fine line at times, but so much time is spent establishing his character all the actions and problems are believable.When he shows up to pick up their daughter, it is clear he is trying very hard to present a good image to his ex-wife. He quickly states he has found a new job and will start tomorrow and thinks this is enough reason for her to let him back into the house and into her life. But Annie will clearly need more convincing. There is an off-hand comment about Glenn being a born again Christian and we realize this man is trying to swim back from the depths.Amy Sedaris and Nicky Katt are also good as Barb and Nate, a couple who are married and working hard to make ends meet. But that doesn't mean they don't each have their own problems.The story moves at a measured, deliberate pace. We learn a lot about each of the characters and see how they interact and how these interactions help to keep these people prisoner in their lives. Not everyone will make it through this story and this only serves to illustrate how hard it is for some of these people to function in normal, everyday life.",4,"A Haunting, Extremely Well-Told

1182394,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B001DN0V02,Wuchak,"[2, 4]","Yes. 2007's ""Snow Angels"" is easily one of the most potent and realistic dramas ever filmed.The story is about a handful of ordinary couples, young and older, in a NE hamlet at winter time (filmed in Nova Scotia).Some criticize that the film is depressing but it's inaccurate to say that the WHOLE movie is depressing. Nor does the film leave the viewer in a totally depressed state. There's a lot of beauty and hope amidst the shadows and darkness; and it left me pondering many things, including the numerous real-life people the characters remind me of. Certainly one storyline is tragic and depressing, but that's not the whole focus of the story (altough it is the dominant focus). The film is about romantic relationships in various stages and whether they're successful or not depending upon their responses to the inevitable crises & temptations of life [no major spoilers]:- Arthur and Lila's high school relationship is just budding and seems healthy and promising.- Glenn and Annie's relationship has been devastated by Glenn's alcoholism and anger/obsession issues; Annie wants to move on but foolishly chooses to have an afair with the husband of a friend. She's not only foolish, she's also treacherous! Glenn is truly trying to recover from his personal demons -- he even gets born-again -- but for some reason he has a hard time getting over his ex and moving foward with his life. His struggle between the positive and negative forces within us all is real. Both Sam Rockwell and Kate Beckinsale are outstanding in their roles, Rockwell particularly so. In fact, I've never seen such a realistic and powerful performance. No kidding. The viewer sees his sincere desire to improve his life but foolish and selfish temptations manifest when he's faced with rejection and tragedy. Will he take the wise or foolish path?- Nate and Barb's relationship hits its first major crisis: Nate is discovered to be an adulterer, and not just with one person. Barb understandably responds with fierce anger, at first, until a tragedy shows her true angelic nature.- Arthur's parents separate but maybe there's still hope for their relationship and family.- Glenn's parent's are in the latter stage of a committed relationship, which seems to have been successful.- Glenn's loving & loyal retriever is the anithesis of Annie, who treats Glenn with hostility and desires to move on in life, away from him; although this is understandable, the viewer can't help but empathize and root for Glenn in light of his sincere attempts to improve his life and reconcile with his ex. After all, he's genuine & humble, he loves his daughter (and vice versa) and he's not an unfaithful scumbag. Pay attention to the very last scene to discover the fate of the dog.Take note of the scene where one of the main characters takes down a painting of the cross (which represents love and self-sacrifice, of course) and there's a kid's handprint on the wall accompanied by the word ""me"". This signifies the selfish and immature turn he's decided to make.The film leaves the viewer with hope despite the series of foolish, tragic and criminal events -- hope that love will triumph, a certain couple will stay together and a youthful couple will make wise decisions and overcome the numerous pitfalls that destroy others. It could go either way. Yes, the young couple look happy and natural together, but everyone's like that in the early years of their relationship. Although the movie starts out showing Annie's hostility toward Glenn, she admits that Glenn always used to help her focus on the positive side of life and his total support was always comforting.The film shows a young character flirting with alcohol and pot; not all people get thrown offtrack by flirting with such things, I know, but one main character obviously did. Will he?Only time -- and wrong or right choices -- will answer these questions.Right after seeing the film I read the story about a recent incident in Arizona that mirrors the main storyline in the film. It happens.""Snow Angels"" IS reality in every sense -- storyline, cast, acting, music, etc. In fact, the film is brilliant. Once seen, you'll never forget it. I'll personally treasure it for decades to come. My only complaint is that sometimes the camera bobbles around too much, drawing attention to itself. I realize the director is trying to be hip but the camera should never draw attention to itself. Fads pass away while solid filmmaking endures.The movie runs 107 minutes and the dvd is a flipflop featuring both standard and widescreen versions.",5,The most potent and realistic drama ever filmed?,1283126400,"08 30, 2010",2010,4573,"['Yes', '2007', 'Snow', 'Angels', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'potent', 'realistic', 'dramas', 'ever', 'filmed.The', 'story', 'handful', 'ordinary', 'couples', 'young', 'older', 'NE', 'hamlet', 'winter', 'time', 'filmed', 'Nova', 'Scotia', '.Some', 'criticize', 'film', 'depressing', 'inaccurate', 'say', 'WHOLE', 'movie', 'depressing', 'film', 'leave', 'viewer', 'totally', 'depressed', 'state', 'lot', 'beauty', 'hope', 'amidst', 'shadows', 'darkness', 'left', 'pondering', 'many', 'things', 'including', 'numerous', 'real-life', 'people', 'characters', 'remind', 'Certainly', 'one', 'storyline', 'tragic', 'depressing', 'not', 'whole', 'focus', 'story', 'dominant', 'focus', 'film', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'various', 'stages', ""'re"", 'successful', 'not', 'depending', 'responses', 'inevitable', 'crises', 'temptations', 'life', '[', 'major', 'spoilers', ']', 'Arthur', 'Lila', 'high', 'school', 'relationship', 'just', 'budding', 'healthy', 'promising.-', 'Glenn', 'Annie', 'relationship', 'been', 'devastated', 'Glenn', 'alcoholism', 'anger/obsession', 'issues', 'Annie', 'move', 'foolishly', 'chooses', 'have', 'afair', 'husband', 'friend', 'not', 'only', 'foolish', 'also', 'treacherous', 'Glenn', 'truly', 'trying', 'recover', 'personal', 'demons', 'even', 'born-again', 'reason', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'ex', 'moving', 'foward', 'life', 'struggle', 'positive', 'negative', 'forces', 'real', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'are', 'outstanding', 'roles', 'Rockwell', 'particularly', 'so', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'realistic', 'powerful', 'performance', 'kidding', 'viewer', 'sincere', 'desire', 'improve', 'life', 'foolish', 'selfish', 'temptations', 'manifest', 'when', 'faced', 'rejection', 'tragedy', 'Will', 'take', 'wise', 'foolish', 'path', 'Nate', 'Barb', 'relationship', 'first', 'major', 'crisis', 'Nate', 'discovered', 'be', 'adulterer', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'person', 'Barb', 'understandably', 'fierce', 'anger', 'first', 'tragedy', 'true', 'angelic', 'nature.-', 'Arthur', 'parents', 'separate', 'maybe', 'still', 'hope', 'relationship', 'family.-', 'Glenn', 'parent', 'are', 'latter', 'stage', 'committed', 'relationship', 'have', 'been', 'successful.-', 'Glenn', 'loving', 'loyal', 'retriever', 'anithesis', 'Annie', 'who', 'Glenn', 'hostility', 'desires', 'move', 'life', 'away', 'understandable', 'viewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'empathize', 'root', 'Glenn', 'light', 'sincere', 'attempts', 'improve', 'life', 'reconcile', 'ex', 'genuine', 'humble', 'daughter', 'vice', 'versa', 'not', 'unfaithful', 'scumbag', 'Pay', 'attention', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'discover', 'fate', 'dog.Take', 'note', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'down', 'painting', 'cross', 'love', 'self-sacrifice', 'course', 'kid', 'handprint', 'wall', 'accompanied', 'word', 'selfish', 'immature', 'turn', 'decided', 'make.The', 'film', 'viewer', 'hope', 'series', 'foolish', 'tragic', 'criminal', 'events', 'hope', 'love', 'will', 'triumph', 'certain', 'couple', 'will', 'stay', 'together', 'youthful', 'couple', 'will', 'make', 'wise', 'decisions', 'overcome', 'numerous', 'pitfalls', 'destroy', 'others', 'could', 'go', 'way', 'Yes', 'young', 'couple', 'look', 'happy', 'natural', 'together', 'everyone', 'early', 'years', 'relationship', 'movie', 'out', 'showing', 'Annie', 'hostility', 'Glenn', 'Glenn', 'always', 'used', 'help', 'focus', 'positive', 'side', 'life', 'total', 'support', 'was', 'always', 'comforting.The', 'film', 'young', 'character', 'flirting', 'alcohol', 'pot', 'not', 'people', 'get', 'thrown', 'offtrack', 'flirting', 'such', 'things', 'know', 'one', 'main', 'character', 'obviously', 'did', 'Will', 'Only', 'time', 'wrong', 'right', 'choices', 'will', 'answer', 'questions.Right', 'seeing', 'film', 'read', 'story', 'recent', 'incident', 'Arizona', 'main', 'storyline', 'film', 'Snow', 'Angels', 'reality', 'sense', 'storyline', 'cast', 'acting', 'music', 'etc', 'fact', 'film', 'brilliant', 'Once', 'seen', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', ""'ll"", 'personally', 'treasure', 'decades', 'come', 'My', 'only', 'complaint', 'sometimes', 'camera', 'around', 'too', 'much', 'drawing', 'attention', 'realize', 'director', 'trying', 'be', 'hip', 'camera', 'should', 'never', 'draw', 'attention', 'Fads', 'pass', 'away', 'solid', 'filmmaking', 'endures.The', 'movie', '107', 'minutes', 'dvd', 'flipflop', 'featuring', 'standard', 'widescreen', 'versions']",N/A
1182395,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001DN0V02,Z Hayes,"[3, 3]","""Snow Angels' is one of the most depressing movies I've ever watched, yet it is also a well-acted, searing human drama that explores the complexities of human relationships and the darkness within some souls.The story begins in winter in a small town in Pennsylvania, with members of a high school marching band rehearsing on a football field. Suddenly, two shots pierce the air and we are taken via flashback to a few weeks prior where the drama unfolds.Annie [Kate Beckinsale] is a single mom and waitress who is separated from her loser husband, Glenn [Sam Rockwell] and they have a little girl named Tara who lives with Annie. Glenn is desperate to get back with Annie [going so far as to try suicide when Annie dumps him] and is basically a very unstable person. To complicate matters, Annie is sleeping with her best friend Barb's [Amy Sedaris] husband[ Nicky Katt] a philanderer and jerk.Then there is teenager Arthur [Michael Angarano] who harbored a childhood infatuation for Annie [his ex-babysitter] and whose own life is beset by family problems - his parents [Jeanetta Arnett & Grifin Dunne] decide to live apart due to dad's adultery.However, amidst all this convoluted human suffering and relationship woes there is a spot of happiness - Arthur forms a close bond with a new girl in school, Lila [Olivia Thirlby from Juno and The Secret] and their blossoming relationship is a relief against an otherwise gloomy backdrop.The acting in this movie is above average - Kate Beckinsale flexes some serious acting chops here and her character really goes through some terrible upheavals. Sam Rockwell as the estranged husband Glenn is also worth mentioning as his character comes to personify a truly unhinged person driven to desperation.The movie is basically a long ride down a dark path of human misery with nothing to cheer about [except perhaps the two teens], but it is a riveting drama that kind of sucks you in to the point you just feel you have to watch it to its inevitable conclusion. Final verdict - worth watching but one may want to follow this up with a more uplifting offering!",4,A harrowing ride into the dark recesses of the human soul,1222300800,"09 25, 2008",2008,2104,"['Snow', 'Angels', 'one', 'most', 'depressing', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'also', 'well-acted', 'searing', 'human', 'drama', 'complexities', 'human', 'relationships', 'darkness', 'souls.The', 'story', 'winter', 'small', 'town', 'Pennsylvania', 'members', 'high', 'school', 'marching', 'band', 'rehearsing', 'football', 'field', 'Suddenly', 'two', 'shots', 'pierce', 'air', 'are', 'taken', 'flashback', 'few', 'weeks', 'prior', 'where', 'drama', 'unfolds.Annie', '[', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', ']', 'single', 'mom', 'waitress', 'who', 'separated', 'loser', 'husband', 'Glenn', '[', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', ']', 'have', 'little', 'girl', 'named', 'Tara', 'who', 'Annie', 'Glenn', 'desperate', 'get', 'back', 'Annie', '[', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'try', 'suicide', 'when', 'Annie', ']', 'basically', 'very', 'unstable', 'person', 'complicate', 'matters', 'Annie', 'sleeping', 'best', 'friend', 'Barb', '[', 'Amy', 'Sedaris', ']', 'husband', '[', 'Nicky', 'Katt', 'philanderer', 'jerk.Then', 'teenager', 'Arthur', '[', 'Michael', 'Angarano', ']', 'who', 'harbored', 'childhood', 'infatuation', 'Annie', '[', 'ex-babysitter', ']', 'own', 'life', 'beset', 'family', 'problems', 'parents', '[', 'Jeanetta', 'Arnett', 'Grifin', 'Dunne', ']', 'decide', 'live', 'apart', 'due', 'dad', 'adultery.However', 'amidst', 'convoluted', 'human', 'suffering', 'relationship', 'woes', 'spot', 'happiness', 'Arthur', 'close', 'bond', 'new', 'girl', 'school', 'Lila', '[', 'Olivia', 'Thirlby', 'Juno', 'Secret', ']', 'blossoming', 'relationship', 'relief', 'otherwise', 'gloomy', 'backdrop.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'above', 'average', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'flexes', 'serious', 'acting', 'chops', 'here', 'character', 'really', 'terrible', 'upheavals', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'estranged', 'husband', 'Glenn', 'also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'character', 'personify', 'truly', 'unhinged', 'person', 'driven', 'desperation.The', 'movie', 'basically', 'long', 'ride', 'dark', 'path', 'human', 'misery', 'nothing', 'cheer', '[', 'perhaps', 'two', 'teens', ']', 'riveting', 'drama', 'kind', 'sucks', 'point', 'just', 'feel', 'have', 'watch', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'Final', 'verdict', 'worth', 'watching', 'one', 'may', 'want', 'follow', 'up', 'more', 'uplifting', 'offering']",N/A
