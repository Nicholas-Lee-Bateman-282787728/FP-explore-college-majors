I didn't think I would like it, but it was actually quite good.  Tension, drama, comedy - it all makes for a good season.  This season we see Malik evolving, get introduced to Blue and Kiera, and see how Jason develops as a husband.",4,Disappointed When Tia Left (or Contract Expired),1394064000,"03 6, 2014",2014,319,"['did', ""n't"", 'think', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'not', 'definitely', 'different', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'like', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'Tension', 'drama', 'comedy', 'good', 'season', 'season', 'see', 'Malik', 'evolving', 'get', 'introduced', 'Blue', 'Kiera', 'see', 'how', 'Jason', 'husband']",The Game: Season 6
1670713,A1GLQW7JGGKK9Z,B00F8BI4QS,"King Shabazz ""King Shabazz""","[5, 6]","Season 6 proved to be very entertaining television. The reason being that The Game did a solid job of re-inventing itself. It was a very bold move to replace the leads (Melanie & Derwin) with 2 new characters (Kiera & Blue). At first I was skeptical about whether this was the right decision. But without even realizing, it was a change that the show truly needed (The angles of Melanie & Derwin had run their course at least 2 seasons ago). Though Kiera & Blue do present the typical problems of a new couple, their back stories are very fresh and provide new ground to tap into. This season also enabled viewers to better understand Jason as a ""significant other"" for the honeymoon phase of his new marriage to Chardonnay has ended, leaving the married couple to handle real business at hand. The character of Tasha comes across as much more annoying this season, but this provides the lead-in to her entangled life's breaking point (which made for interesting revelations). Malik continues to be Malik, though in new situations to challenge him (truly for the worst), as well as others around the troubled star. The show is strong once again. Due to return March 2014, we can expect the return of Kelly (Jason's ex-wife), solidifying the fact that The Game is no longer limited to a ""game"" as it continues to kick the door open on the trials and tribulations of everyday life.",5,The Art of Re-Invention,1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,1379,"['Season', '6', 'proved', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'television', 'reason', 'being', 'Game', 'did', 'solid', 'job', 're-inventing', 'was', 'very', 'bold', 'move', 'replace', 'leads', 'Melanie', 'Derwin', '2', 'new', 'characters', 'Kiera', 'Blue', 'first', 'was', 'skeptical', 'was', 'right', 'decision', 'even', 'realizing', 'was', 'change', 'show', 'truly', 'needed', 'angles', 'Melanie', 'Derwin', 'had', 'run', 'course', 'least', '2', 'seasons', 'ago', 'Though', 'Kiera', 'Blue', 'do', 'present', 'typical', 'problems', 'new', 'couple', 'back', 'stories', 'are', 'very', 'fresh', 'provide', 'new', 'ground', 'tap', 'season', 'also', 'enabled', 'viewers', 'better', 'understand', 'Jason', 'significant', 'other', 'honeymoon', 'phase', 'new', 'marriage', 'Chardonnay', 'ended', 'leaving', 'married', 'couple', 'handle', 'real', 'business', 'hand', 'character', 'Tasha', 'as', 'much', 'more', 'annoying', 'season', 'lead-in', 'entangled', 'life', 'breaking', 'point', 'made', 'interesting', 'revelations', 'Malik', 'be', 'Malik', 'though', 'new', 'situations', 'challenge', 'truly', 'worst', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'troubled', 'star', 'show', 'strong', 'once', 'again', 'Due', 'return', 'March', '2014', 'can', 'expect', 'return', 'Kelly', 'Jason', 'ex-wife', 'solidifying', 'fact', 'Game', 'no', 'longer', 'limited', 'game', 'kick', 'door', 'open', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'everyday', 'life']",The Game: Season 6

1670715,AA45X7CUSC39B,B00F8BI4QS,Shanon,"[0, 0]","Season 6 of &#34;The Game&#34; saw us saying goodbye to the lead characters Derwin and Melanie Davis, and welcoming two new characters, new football recruit Bryce &#34;Blueprint (Blue)&#34; Westbrook and former child actress Keira Whitaker. It was tough to see The Davis' go. They were the glue that held the show together. I was happy that Pooch Hall (Derwin) returned in the season premiere to give his character a proper send off. Pooch gave his BEST performance ever on the season premiere, making it even harder to see Derwin go. Blue and Keira were nice additions to the show. Their hot and cold relationship reminded us of Derwin and Melanie before marriage. Malik was still being his arrogant self, Jason was still being a cheap a**, but it was good to see his new sharp tongued wife Chardonnay (Brandy) keep him in check. Tasha was still her lovable ghetto self, trying to maintain two romantic relationships (Pookie and Rick Fox). This season was a step up from Season 5. The shows were more concise and enjoyable. One of the best TV shows in the TV game.",5,"Goodbye Melanie & Derwin, Hello Keira and Blue",1403827200,"06 27, 2014",2014,1065,"['Season', '6', '34', 'Game', '34', 'saw', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'lead', 'characters', 'Derwin', 'Melanie', 'Davis', 'welcoming', 'two', 'new', 'characters', 'new', 'football', 'recruit', 'Bryce', '34', 'Blueprint', 'Blue', '34', 'Westbrook', 'former', 'child', 'actress', 'Keira', 'Whitaker', 'was', 'tough', 'see', 'Davis', 'go', 'were', 'glue', 'held', 'show', 'together', 'was', 'happy', 'Pooch', 'Hall', 'Derwin', 'returned', 'season', 'premiere', 'give', 'character', 'proper', 'send', 'Pooch', 'gave', 'BEST', 'performance', 'ever', 'season', 'premiere', 'making', 'even', 'harder', 'see', 'Derwin', 'go', 'Blue', 'Keira', 'were', 'nice', 'additions', 'show', 'hot', 'cold', 'relationship', 'reminded', 'Derwin', 'Melanie', 'marriage', 'Malik', 'was', 'still', 'being', 'arrogant', 'self', 'Jason', 'was', 'still', 'being', 'cheap', 'a**', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'new', 'sharp', 'tongued', 'wife', 'Chardonnay', 'Brandy', 'keep', 'check', 'Tasha', 'was', 'still', 'lovable', 'ghetto', 'self', 'trying', 'maintain', 'two', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'Pookie', 'Rick', 'Fox', 'season', 'was', 'step', 'up', 'Season', '5', 'shows', 'were', 'more', 'concise', 'enjoyable', 'One', 'best', 'TV', 'shows', 'TV', 'game']",The Game: Season 6
