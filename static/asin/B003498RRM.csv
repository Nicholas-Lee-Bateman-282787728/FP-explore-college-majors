The concept of two people (partners) somehow separating their lives by flipping a coin to decide which of two directions they go and then to again meet but with the other's (partner) parallel self and then see what happens is interesting in a far fetched sort of way.(2.) Great acting by the main characters helped pulled it off more than so than the story otherwise would have been.(3.) Yellow and green identifiers to sort out the parallel lives was fun and useful.Negatives:(1.) Confusing beginning especially the running and with no setup explanation to guide the viewer as to what's taking place it made the viewing more of a ""Huh""? experience until you sort it out.(2.) Failed to utilize the rescued dog angle to complete that half of the story. Maybe should have had the dog save the lives of the other parallel halves story. The dysfunctional family life was shallow in one half and the gangster story as a counterpoint was good idea but was a poorly constructed in the other half.(3) Would have been a more finished/complete story to somehow interact the two parallel halves at the end for some sort of explanation or closure.Neutral: If you're confused at this point don't worry you'll see.",2,Interesting Idea but Poorly Implemented,1278028800,"07 2, 2010",2010,1215,"['Positives', '1', 'concept', 'two', 'people', 'partners', 'somehow', 'separating', 'lives', 'flipping', 'coin', 'decide', 'two', 'directions', 'go', 'then', 'again', 'meet', 'other', 'partner', 'parallel', 'self', 'then', 'see', 'what', 'interesting', 'far', 'fetched', 'sort', 'way.', '2', 'Great', 'acting', 'main', 'characters', 'helped', 'pulled', 'off', 'more', 'so', 'story', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'been.', '3', 'Yellow', 'green', 'identifiers', 'sort', 'out', 'parallel', 'lives', 'was', 'fun', 'useful.Negatives', '1', 'Confusing', 'beginning', 'especially', 'running', 'setup', 'explanation', 'guide', 'viewer', 'what', 'taking', 'place', 'made', 'viewing', 'more', 'Huh', 'experience', 'sort', '2', 'Failed', 'utilize', 'rescued', 'dog', 'angle', 'complete', 'half', 'story', 'Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'dog', 'save', 'lives', 'other', 'parallel', 'halves', 'story', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'life', 'was', 'shallow', 'one', 'half', 'gangster', 'story', 'counterpoint', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'was', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'other', 'half', '3', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'finished/complete', 'story', 'somehow', 'interact', 'two', 'parallel', 'halves', 'end', 'sort', 'explanation', 'closure.Neutral', ""'re"", 'confused', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""'ll"", 'see']",Uncertainty

A young couple finds themselves unable to make what is obviously an important decision, so he tosses a coin, and the film goes off in two different directions, each representing a different result of the coin toss. One direction lands them by chance in a very dangerous situation, while the other lands them in the middle of family issues. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has made some very interesting choices on the independent film path, and Uncertainty can be added to that list. Both leads, especially Gordon-Levitt, are so good that we are drawn into both scenarios with equal interest, wondering all the while how the two scenarios will either merge or at least intersect. The disappointment comes in the fact that the scenarios do neither; the film ends with both scenarios continuing on their on their own path - ""we just go on from here."" Yes, there is uncertainty in any decision we make and there is no way of knowing where the path will lead. However, desire the title, uncertainty as an ending to this film was rather flat and left me unsatisfied.

1321016,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003498RRM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[15, 17]","There are certain actors that I will follow on faith, and through the years Joseph Gordon-Levitt has become one of those people.  He has managed his career with precision, bouncing between indie and mainstream fare as well as lead and supporting roles.  I always appreciate a young actor who is willing to take chances, to pick roles and movies that they're passionate about or that might challenge them.  Gordon-Levitt rose to the top of his generation with an eclectic bounty of great performances in oddball films (Brick, Mysterious Skin, The Lookout) and, in my opinion, recently delivered Oscar caliber work in ""(500) Days of Summer"" and stole every scene he was in during ""Inception.""  So despite the fairly negative reaction that ""Uncertainty"" had garnered, I was willing to enter this variation of ""Sliding Doors"" (yes, other films have employed a similar narrative--sorry, the Gwyneth Paltrow feature is where my mind goes) with open arms.  The good news is that Gordon-Levitt and an appealing Lynn Collins embrace the movie's challenges with gusto.  The bad news is that one story is completely implausible while one is, sadly, too mundane.The conceit of ""Uncertainty"" is that one decision can affect your entire life.  At the beginning of the film, the young couple stands in the middle of a bridge--each then runs in opposite directions to launch two disparate stories based on that choice.  The GREEN story follows the pair to a family outing with Collins' extended clan.  This bit is gently observed, sweet, and humorous.  I liked the story, but it was not as impactful as I might have wanted.  The YELLOW story, however, provides more intrigue.  Finding a lost cell phone, our duo find themselves enmeshed in a dangerous game of cat and mouse with the phone's owner.  Based on a terrific idea, it doesn't take long for this sojourn to enter some pretty unlikely territory.  In truth, I loved the idea of this movie with every fiber of my being--for about 30 minutes, I thought this was a gem.  But the outlandish plotting is a game changer.The film does an excellent job at distinguishing the separate story lines with visual cues.  Aside from the obvious wardrobe choices, the colorful designations are represented well with vehicles, street signs, housing decorations, and other noticeable details.  I think the film makers displayed a lot of talent in the intercutting of the two tales from both an editing and visual standpoint.  Both stars acquit themselves well--however, the YELLOW couple is rife with bad decisions and it becomes increasingly difficult to care about their self-created predicament.  After a great beginning and a terribly interesting idea--ultimately, I just couldn't muster much enthusiasm for the way this film played out.  Interesting effort that isn't fully successful, I would still look to the creators and the stars for their next project.

1321017,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B003498RRM,Lee Armstrong,"[1, 1]","Joseph Gordon-Levitt has acted in some excellent independent features.  This isn't one of them.  He is always riveting to watch on screen, and his portrayal of Bobby is no different.  The film doesn't work well because of the enigmatic structure of split concurrent realities.  In one, Bobby finds a phone.  In the other, Bobby finds a dog named Tiger.  There's a parallel, but to what point?  Lynn Collins does a nice job as Bobby's girlfriend, pregnant in one reality.  This part of the film, labeled the ""Green"" storyline, was more interesting as a family drama.  Nelson Landrieu as Uncle Felix does a splendid job.  His strong performance lends great sympathy to those who suffer from Alzheimer's.  Assumpta Serna also does a nice job as the mother who can't convince her younger daughter to take advantage of a scholarship.  The ""Yellow"" storyline has a more exciting plot including an Asian guy chasing the couple and shooting at them.  But ultimately, the phone like the storyline seems discarded.  Scott McGehee who won awards forThe Deep Endand David Siegel who directedBee Seasonteam as both screenwriters and directors.  As directors, the film has good pacing and intercuts well between ""Green"" and ""Yellow"" realities.  But as screenwriters, the film seemed as splintered as the concept.  ""Why?  What's the point?"" were questions that went through my mind.  While there were some strong film performances for which I'm glad I've seen the film, the structure of the story makes this a DVD that I will not add to my personal collection of rainy day films.

1321020,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B003498RRM,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","The course of our lives is determined by the countless decisions - both major and minor - we make on a daily basis.  So much so that one simple and seemingly insignificant act of choice can set the course for our entire future, including where we`ll go to school, who we`ll wind up marrying, whether we`ll be killed crossing that street or live another fifty years because we took a different route entirely.  That is the theme explored in ""Uncertainty,"" a dual-level drama produced, written and directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel.The movie opens with a young couple - played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Lynn Collins - standing on the Brooklyn Bridge, obviously on the brink of making some major decision regarding their future.  After a coin flip, one heads in one direction (to Manhattan) and one in the other (to Brooklyn), leading the couple to have distinctly different experiences in what might be thought of as parallel universes.  In the Manhattan-based scenario, Bobby and Kate, dressed in yellow, are plunged into a bizarre cloak-and-dagger tale set off by the finding of a cell phone in the back of a cab (a bit like ""24"" if it were made on an indie-film budget);  the other direction leads to a more mundane domestic drama wherein the lovers, dressed in green, celebrate the 4th of July with Kate's family, including the overly critical mother who drives the young woman crazy with her negativity and interference.The different-paths-equals-different-outcomes theme has been explored before, most notably in 1998's ""Sliding Doors,"" but here the why and the wherefore of it all seems to have eluded the filmmakers - as it does us.  Each storyline is interesting enough in its own right - and the acting and direction are first-rate throughout - but they fail to come together in any kind of a meaningful way.  They literally run along parallel tracks, with no point of convergence from which we can deduce a point - unless it's that bright yellow is probably not the best fashion choice when you're trying to outrun a hit man.Moreover, the movie doesn't lay down the ground rules for the scenario in a very coherent or consistent fashion.  The synopsis for the film says that the couple uses the coin flip to determine how they're going to spend that holiday weekend.  Yet, it's obviously much more complicated than that, for in one version, Kate is pregnant, but in the other she isn`t (or, at least, it`s never mentioned).  In one, she is the star of a Broadway play; in the other, she says she works at a restaurant.  And the two couples obviously live in different parts of town.  Perhaps, consistency really is the hobgoblin of little minds and we should be looking at the larger picture here, but, all the same, the movie leaves us with a lot of unanswered questons, which may not necessarily be a bad thing, but it can make for a frustrating experience at times.I recommend watching ""Uncertainty"" for the risks it takes and the mood it sets (Peter Nashel's evocative score is very helpful in that regard) but, when it comes right down to it, the movie seems a commendable but over-elaborate effort at stating the obvious.",3,of some interest but the premise is insufficiently developed,1296000000,"01 26, 2011",2011,3147,"['course', 'lives', 'determined', 'countless', 'decisions', 'major', 'minor', 'make', 'daily', 'basis', 'So', 'much', 'one', 'simple', 'seemingly', 'insignificant', 'act', 'choice', 'can', 'set', 'course', 'entire', 'future', 'including', 'where', 'll', 'go', 'school', 'who', 'll', 'wind', 'up', 'marrying', 'll', 'be', 'killed', 'crossing', 'street', 'live', 'fifty', 'years', 'took', 'different', 'route', 'entirely', 'theme', 'explored', 'Uncertainty', 'dual-level', 'drama', 'produced', 'written', 'directed', 'Scott', 'McGehee', 'David', 'Siegel.The', 'movie', 'young', 'couple', 'played', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'standing', 'Brooklyn', 'Bridge', 'obviously', 'brink', 'making', 'major', 'decision', 'regarding', 'future', 'coin', 'flip', 'one', 'heads', 'one', 'direction', 'Manhattan', 'one', 'other', 'Brooklyn', 'leading', 'couple', 'have', 'distinctly', 'different', 'experiences', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'thought', 'parallel', 'universes', 'Manhattan-based', 'scenario', 'Bobby', 'Kate', 'dressed', 'yellow', 'are', 'plunged', 'bizarre', 'cloak-and-dagger', 'tale', 'set', 'off', 'finding', 'cell', 'phone', 'back', 'cab', 'bit', '24', 'were', 'made', 'indie-film', 'budget', 'other', 'direction', 'more', 'mundane', 'domestic', 'drama', 'wherein', 'lovers', 'dressed', 'green', 'celebrate', '4th', 'July', 'Kate', 'family', 'including', 'overly', 'critical', 'mother', 'who', 'young', 'woman', 'crazy', 'negativity', 'interference.The', 'different-paths-equals-different-outcomes', 'theme', 'been', 'explored', 'most', 'notably', '1998', 'Sliding', 'Doors', 'here', 'why', 'wherefore', 'have', 'eluded', 'filmmakers', 'storyline', 'interesting', 'enough', 'own', 'right', 'acting', 'direction', 'are', 'first-rate', 'fail', 'come', 'together', 'kind', 'meaningful', 'way', 'literally', 'run', 'along', 'parallel', 'tracks', 'point', 'convergence', 'can', 'deduce', 'point', 'bright', 'yellow', 'probably', 'not', 'best', 'fashion', 'choice', 'when', ""'re"", 'trying', 'outrun', 'hit', 'man.Moreover', 'movie', ""n't"", 'lay', 'down', 'ground', 'rules', 'scenario', 'very', 'coherent', 'consistent', 'fashion', 'synopsis', 'film', 'couple', 'coin', 'flip', 'determine', 'how', ""'re"", 'going', 'spend', 'holiday', 'weekend', 'obviously', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'one', 'version', 'Kate', 'pregnant', 'other', 'isn', 't', 'least', 's', 'never', 'mentioned', 'one', 'star', 'Broadway', 'play', 'other', 'restaurant', 'two', 'couples', 'obviously', 'live', 'different', 'parts', 'town', 'Perhaps', 'consistency', 'really', 'hobgoblin', 'little', 'minds', 'should', 'be', 'looking', 'larger', 'picture', 'here', 'same', 'movie', 'lot', 'unanswered', 'questons', 'may', 'not', 'necessarily', 'be', 'bad', 'thing', 'can', 'make', 'frustrating', 'experience', 'times.I', 'recommend', 'watching', 'Uncertainty', 'risks', 'mood', 'Peter', 'Nashel', 'evocative', 'score', 'very', 'helpful', 'regard', 'when', 'right', 'down', 'movie', 'commendable', 'over-elaborate', 'effort', 'stating', 'obvious']",Uncertainty

The film starts with them on Brooklyn Bridge in New York where they toss a coin and on seeing which side it is they both run off in opposite directions. Then as if by magic they both appear at the other end to meet the other one where the stories diverge and we get two alternate tales- one is `yellow' and one is `green', but not sure what the significance was except the yellow version has a yellow cab in it (?)!Incidentally this is not two different perspectives on the same story, but two completely different stories. One finds them picking up a stray dog, then going round to her moms where they face up to family and life issues, loss and a bad case of thespianisis. The other sees them finding a lost mobile phone in the back of the cab and then getting into a load of high octane adventures with a hit man or two who want it back.Of the two the action story is the more gripping and so it was strange to juxtapose that with a story of family frailty and relationship issues. Had the latter been more explosive like a take from Tennessee Williams play for example then it would have been a better foil for the duelling of the two tales. As it is more subtle it sort of keeps letting the film go slightly off the boil. Then it is back to the action etc. And it is all full on againAll of the acting is fine but even Gordon-Levitt (playing a Canadian who does not say `aboot' - as if) can not breathe enough life into his character in places, and we all know he is a top rate actor and probably chose to do this as he likes supporting indie films, much to his credit. It is not a bad film though and is actually one of those that keeps you hooked right to the end. However not everyone will be satisfied with the end and for the pedants out there you will not miss a slightly obvious plot hole, but that aside this is still a well directed and filmed effort, hence the rating, but it is only just four stars as I am being generous as I had a great night out last night and am probably still a bit squiffy- if in doubt just go for a rental.",4,Two Films in One in this Quirky Indie Affair,1340409600,"06 23, 2012",2012,2200,"['two', 'stories', 'one', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Bobby', 'boyfriend', 'Green', 'Card', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'holder', 'Lynn', 'Collins', 'who', 'Kate', 'film', 'Brooklyn', 'Bridge', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'toss', 'coin', 'seeing', 'side', 'run', 'off', 'opposite', 'directions', 'Then', 'magic', 'appear', 'other', 'end', 'meet', 'other', 'one', 'where', 'stories', 'diverge', 'get', 'two', 'alternate', 'tales-', 'one', 'yellow', 'one', 'green', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'significance', 'was', 'yellow', 'version', 'yellow', 'cab', 'Incidentally', 'not', 'two', 'different', 'perspectives', 'same', 'story', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'stories', 'One', 'picking', 'up', 'stray', 'dog', 'then', 'going', 'round', 'moms', 'where', 'face', 'up', 'family', 'life', 'issues', 'loss', 'bad', 'case', 'thespianisis', 'other', 'finding', 'lost', 'mobile', 'phone', 'back', 'cab', 'then', 'getting', 'load', 'high', 'octane', 'adventures', 'hit', 'man', 'two', 'who', 'want', 'two', 'action', 'story', 'more', 'gripping', 'was', 'strange', 'juxtapose', 'story', 'family', 'frailty', 'relationship', 'issues', 'Had', 'latter', 'been', 'more', 'explosive', 'take', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'play', 'example', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'foil', 'duelling', 'two', 'tales', 'more', 'subtle', 'sort', 'keeps', 'letting', 'film', 'go', 'slightly', 'boil', 'Then', 'back', 'action', 'etc', 'full', 'againAll', 'acting', 'fine', 'even', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'playing', 'Canadian', 'who', 'not', 'say', 'aboot', 'can', 'not', 'breathe', 'enough', 'life', 'character', 'places', 'know', 'top', 'rate', 'actor', 'probably', 'chose', 'do', 'supporting', 'indie', 'films', 'much', 'credit', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'actually', 'one', 'keeps', 'hooked', 'right', 'end', 'However', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'be', 'satisfied', 'end', 'pedants', 'out', 'there', 'will', 'not', 'miss', 'slightly', 'obvious', 'plot', 'hole', 'aside', 'still', 'well', 'directed', 'filmed', 'effort', 'hence', 'rating', 'only', 'just', 'four', 'stars', 'am', 'being', 'generous', 'had', 'great', 'night', 'last', 'night', 'am', 'probably', 'still', 'bit', 'squiffy-', 'doubt', 'just', 'go', 'rental']",Uncertainty
