1115712,A3FBX7QRP0B7S8,B000Y11B7G,JboneCA,"[0, 0]","There are exactly three movies from my childhood that I will always remember and love. The first is Fievel Goes West, the second is 101 Dalmatians, and the third is Homeward Bound. For whatever reason, movies with anthropomorphic animals seem infinitely better than those without.Homeward Bound is special. Where as most movies today with &#34;talking&#34; animals are corny, unbelievable, or poorly developed, this one does it right. All three animals have their own distinct personalities and the conflict they face is relatable. Shadow is the wise, responsible, heartfelt leader of the trio, Chance is the lovable comedic relief who rises to the challenge when Shadow can't, and Sassy is the stereotypical stubborn but cunning cat.Both of these movies are wonderful, but I prefer the first of the series. In this one, they are left at a ranch to be cared for during their owners' vacation. But, they become restless and set out to find their way home. Between their interactions with other animals, their traversing the wild, and their relationships with each other this movie teaches, entertains, and reminds the viewer how special our pets are.The second contains equal adventure, with a few more animals and love thrown into the mix as the trio have to navigate San Francisco. This is also a great movie, buy specifically bought this pack for the first one.I understand how sappy a grown man must sound recounting this brilliant movie, but I'm not embarrassed!

1115718,A1UYUPHN7NOU8F,B000Y11B7G,La Belle (The Beauty),"[1, 1]","There's an older movie that Homeward Bound was based on. It is called ""The Incredible Journey."" Some people say that movie is better, and maybe it is. I definitely intend to find out. I've seen some movies on Youtube, maybe it will be there. If it is, I'll definitely watch it.The first Homeward Bound movie definitely had some touching moments. The most touching moment that gripped my heart was a scene at the end when the pets were almost home. These animals were excellent actors. The way they acted on the movie fit really well with their voice overs. The characters were wonderful in these movies.""Sassy"" the beautiful Himalayan cat, was a hilarious character in this movie, basically because of her sarcastic wit. She can also be very kind when she wants to be. Especially in the scene where the dog named Chance gets smacked in the face by the tail of a porcupine. (Ouch!) Sassy tries to get the Porcupine needles out of her friend with her teeth, but doesn't succeed because they are in too deep. Or when a young child was lost and scared, Sassy and the dogs kept the child warm until her parents found her.""Shadow"" is the name of the older dog. He's a Golden Retriever and he's very wise, and very loving, both with his animal friends, and his human friends.""Chance"" is an American Bulldog with a lot of energy and an insatiable curiosity about things that he never knew existed. His curiosity gets him into trouble, like when he wanted to sniff the porcupine. He also almost got in trouble with a huge bear, but ran away from it quickly enough to save himself.In this film, there is a family that is combined by marriage. After the wedding, the family goes on a trip and they decide to leave the animals on a ranch with a friend of theirs. Shadow, the older dog, gets panicky because his family doesn't come back for him and the other two when he thinks they should, so he starts on a long journey back home and the other two follow him because they don't want to be left there. Along the way back home they meet with new adventures. They run into wild animals, and Sassy even survives a great big waterfall. This is a great movie to watch if you have a certain night where you spend time with your family. This movie has a lot of special moments. There are moments where you'll smile, as well as moments where you'll cry, because of the very touching, emotional aspects of it.________________________________________________________________________________________Homeward Bound 2 wasn't as good as the first one in my opinion. I liked it, but I think the first one had a better story, and it gripped my heart more.This one is a little similar to the first one. The pets get lost again, but instead of being lost in nature, they get lost in a big city and they have to find their way home again, like in the first one. Along the way, they meet other dogs. Some of the dogs are friendly, and some are mean. The friendly ones try to help them find their way home and the mean ones want to eat Sassy. All the while, Shadow and Chance try to protect Sassy. There are other things that happen to them along the way. It's been a while since I've seen this one so I don't really remember everything. They do make it home eventually, like they did in the first one. Homeward bound 2 is a good adventure story, but it's a different kind of adventure than it's predecessor. I didn't see Homeward Bound 2 in theaters, but I bought this 2-in-1 movie DVD a while back. I've actually seen the first one a lot more times than the second one because we used to have the VHS version of the first when I was a kid. Both are good movies.

And having watched them at least 20 times each, now I can say that I have thoroughly reviwed the films and am in a place to say without reservation that this will please all children from about 3 onward. There is plenty of fun dialogue for older kids to enjoy, and there is a lot of comedic action at every turn. The plots are similar for each movie, but not at all boring the second time as all the action is in San Francisco.

The first movie follows the same action as The Incredible Journey, only the older dog is not the bull terrier but a golden retriever named Shadow. The bull terrier is now Chance, a pitbull, and the Siamese is a Himalayan named Sassy. They also have voices supplied by Don Ameche, Michael J. Fox, and Sally Field. That part I do not like although the dialog is funny, especially the spats between Chance and Sassy,  with Shadow as the peacemaker. We see more of them in Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco where they are taken in by a group of dogs led by Reilly who was tossed aside as a tiny pup on Christmas Day, and a pretty female who takes a shine to Chance. In both movies they are separated from their owners and take different journeys to find them. I liked Lost in San Francisco better, perhaps because it was a new plot and the female, Delilah, was shown that not all humans are bad. The locations are beautiful to watch and the second movie showed me what my mother's favorite city looks like. I do enjoy watching both movies, but would still like to own the original as well.",4,I Almost Gave It 3 Stars But Felt They Were Worth 4,1373587200,"07 12, 2013",2013,1225,"['still', 'want', 'original', 'Incredible', 'Journey', 'animals', 'named', 'were', 'book', 'now', 'two', 'movies', 'will', 'do', 'first', 'movie', 'same', 'action', 'Incredible', 'Journey', 'only', 'older', 'dog', 'not', 'bull', 'terrier', 'golden', 'retriever', 'named', 'Shadow', 'bull', 'terrier', 'now', 'Chance', 'pitbull', 'Siamese', 'Himalayan', 'named', 'Sassy', 'also', 'have', 'voices', 'supplied', 'Don', 'Ameche', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'Sally', 'Field', 'part', 'do', 'not', 'dialog', 'funny', 'especially', 'spats', 'Chance', 'Sassy', 'Shadow', 'peacemaker', 'see', 'more', 'Homeward', 'Bound', 'II', 'Lost', 'San', 'Francisco', 'where', 'are', 'taken', 'group', 'dogs', 'led', 'Reilly', 'who', 'was', 'tossed', 'aside', 'tiny', 'pup', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'pretty', 'female', 'who', 'shine', 'Chance', 'movies', 'are', 'separated', 'owners', 'take', 'different', 'journeys', 'find', 'liked', 'Lost', 'San', 'Francisco', 'better', 'perhaps', 'was', 'new', 'plot', 'female', 'Delilah', 'was', 'shown', 'not', 'humans', 'are', 'bad', 'locations', 'are', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'second', 'movie', 'showed', 'what', 'mother', 'favorite', 'city', 'do', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'movies', 'would', 'still', 'like', 'own', 'original', 'well']",N/A
