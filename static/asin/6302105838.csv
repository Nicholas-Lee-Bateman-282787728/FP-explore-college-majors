Shortly after they arrive, the whole crew are dead and the cause is soon discovered to be a virus. With similar affects to alcohol, the bacteria is soon loose aboard the Enterprise and it is up to Doctor Crusher to develop a cure before the crew meet the same fate as those aboard the Tsiolkowsky.This episode was apparently a copy of the Original Series' ""The Naked Time"". I wouldn't know, having never seen it and not really being a TOS fan. However, The Naked Now itself is a sub-standard TNG episode that was a very strange choice for the series first outing to follow the pilot. How can we really care about what's happening to the characters when, as yet, we don't even really know or understand them? The infamous ""fully-functional"" scene between Data and Tasha Yar is one of the only highlights. Naturally, Wesley saves the day and Tasha makes it quite clear to the android that there won't be a repeat of their actions: ""Data...It never happened"" (I was always sorry that Yar was killed off so early at the end of season one - to me she was the strongest of the female characters and her death meant we had to wait five years until the appearances of Kira and Dax in DS9. Besides... she was my favourite character). Apart from that, this is a fairly average episode that is probably more for the collectors than anyone else.~Jenna~",3,Pretty average,996883200,"08 4, 2001",2001,1402,"['Enterprise', 'mission', 'locate', 'USS', 'Tsiolkowsky', 'Shortly', 'arrive', 'whole', 'crew', 'are', 'dead', 'cause', 'soon', 'discovered', 'be', 'virus', 'similar', 'affects', 'alcohol', 'bacteria', 'soon', 'loose', 'Enterprise', 'Doctor', 'Crusher', 'develop', 'cure', 'crew', 'same', 'fate', 'Tsiolkowsky.This', 'episode', 'was', 'apparently', 'copy', 'Original', 'Series', 'Naked', 'Time', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'having', 'never', 'seen', 'not', 'really', 'being', 'TOS', 'fan', 'However', 'Naked', 'Now', 'sub-standard', 'TNG', 'episode', 'was', 'very', 'strange', 'choice', 'series', 'first', 'outing', 'follow', 'pilot', 'How', 'can', 'really', 'care', 'what', 'happening', 'characters', 'when', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'know', 'understand', 'infamous', 'fully-functional', 'scene', 'Data', 'Tasha', 'Yar', 'one', 'only', 'highlights', 'Naturally', 'Wesley', 'day', 'Tasha', 'quite', 'clear', 'android', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'repeat', 'actions', 'Data', 'never', 'happened', 'was', 'always', 'sorry', 'Yar', 'was', 'killed', 'off', 'so', 'early', 'end', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'strongest', 'female', 'characters', 'death', 'meant', 'had', 'wait', 'five', 'years', 'appearances', 'Kira', 'Dax', 'DS9', 'was', 'favourite', 'character', 'Apart', 'fairly', 'average', 'episode', 'probably', 'more', 'collectors', 'anyone', 'else.~Jenna~']","Star Trek - The Next Generation, Episode 3: The Naked Now VHS"

296180,AO37T54VEP0JQ,6302105838,"B.C. Scribe ""trekviewer""","[0, 1]","A considerably huge misstep for the second episode, this obvious remake of the original series show 'The Naked Time' should have been saved for a later telecast.  We barely get an introduction to the characters in the series pilot and now they are all going to act out of character!  Too many scenes from the original are incorporated into this show as well; the frosted and iced over crew quarters; finding a clothed person taking a shower; crewmembers who appear to have committed suicide; the ship is even commandeered by Wesley who takes over as captain in much the same way Lt. Riley does in the original series episode.  Even though there is an entirely new set of main characters present there is very little variance from the original.Actually, to be fair, this version of the story is slightly better in that there is more humor present and some of the crew flamboyantly exhibits patently amorous behavior, a sign of the times.  People are shown as losing their inhibitions much more effectively and in a broader sense.  In the mid 60's when 'The Naked Time' aired the censors would hardly have allowed the characters to speak so frankly, specifically the scene between Data and Tasha Yar in her quarters; their conversation would have been completely excised in the earlier version.  On the other hand the flirtation between Picard and Crusher seems almost like a spoof and doesn't come off with the humor intended; in fact it's so tame it seems to belong more appropriately in the original version!Getting back to my original observation, too many of the first season episodes were either remakes or reworkings of familiar shows from the original series.  Including this remake there was also 'Hide And Q' that was a thinly camouflaged rewrite of 'Where No Man Has Gone Before' and shortly afterward 'The Last Outpost' aired that had plot elements strongly reminiscent of 'That Which Survives'; a few more copycat shows followed that any venerable Trekkie can recognize.  Once they got away from aping the earlier series though ST: TNG succeeded grandly on it's own terms.  And don't get me wrong; it's not that any of those shows were bad - in fact both shows I cited were excellent first season entries - it's just that the creative staff couldn't have been this desperate and lacking of fresh ideas.  The Enterprise was just embarking on a new mission into an uncharted area of the galaxy.  C'mon!

296181,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6302105838,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 0]","This is the first episode of Star Trek TNG that I saw and I was not impressed. It is a remake of episode 7, ""The Naked Time"" of the original series, so my first impression was that TNG would consist of storylines from the original series. Secondly, it lacked the panache of the original episode, having nothing to equal the dash of Sulu swashbuckling his way around the ship. Furthermore, and by far the worst feature, was that once the crew of the new Enterprise found the historical reference, all they had to do to stop the spread of the disease was to avoid touching each other. It was like they had never heard of biological isolation suits. They go around touching each other and then saying, ""Oh no, I touched you and now I have it."" These are not the actions of Star Fleet officers and they appeared to be pathetic bumblers.Few of the actors seem able to carry off the role of acting intoxicated, and that is another problem. When the crew of the original series were infected, they acted out their repressed psychoses, which is quite different from pretending to be a stumbling drunk. Sulu was never more dynamic than when he was chasing his shipmates around with a sword. Captain Kirk was never more troubled than when his fears were uncontrollably bubbling to the surface.Fortunately, the producers were wise enough to avoid doing this again, creating story lines either independent of the original series or having only a secondary relationship. The only redeeming feature of this episode is that it forces the characters to interact with each other, so we are able to see some of the underlying dynamics in their relationships.",3,A poor retread of an episode in the original series,1070496000,"12 4, 2003",2003,1640,"['first', 'episode', 'Star', 'Trek', 'TNG', 'saw', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'remake', 'episode', '7', 'Naked', 'Time', 'original', 'series', 'first', 'impression', 'was', 'TNG', 'would', 'consist', 'storylines', 'original', 'series', 'Secondly', 'lacked', 'panache', 'original', 'episode', 'having', 'nothing', 'equal', 'dash', 'Sulu', 'swashbuckling', 'way', 'ship', 'Furthermore', 'far', 'worst', 'feature', 'was', 'once', 'crew', 'new', 'Enterprise', 'found', 'historical', 'reference', 'had', 'do', 'stop', 'spread', 'disease', 'was', 'avoid', 'touching', 'other', 'was', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'biological', 'isolation', 'suits', 'go', 'around', 'touching', 'other', 'then', 'saying', 'Oh', 'touched', 'now', 'have', 'are', 'not', 'actions', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'officers', 'appeared', 'be', 'pathetic', 'bumblers.Few', 'actors', 'seem', 'able', 'carry', 'off', 'role', 'acting', 'intoxicated', 'problem', 'When', 'crew', 'original', 'series', 'were', 'infected', 'acted', 'out', 'repressed', 'psychoses', 'quite', 'different', 'pretending', 'be', 'stumbling', 'drunk', 'Sulu', 'was', 'never', 'more', 'dynamic', 'when', 'was', 'chasing', 'shipmates', 'sword', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'was', 'never', 'more', 'troubled', 'when', 'fears', 'were', 'uncontrollably', 'bubbling', 'surface.Fortunately', 'producers', 'were', 'wise', 'enough', 'avoid', 'doing', 'again', 'creating', 'story', 'lines', 'independent', 'original', 'series', 'having', 'only', 'secondary', 'relationship', 'only', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'episode', 'characters', 'interact', 'other', 'are', 'able', 'see', 'underlying', 'dynamics', 'relationships']","Star Trek - The Next Generation, Episode 3: The Naked Now VHS"

This is the funniest, and I mean, FUNNIEST, star trek episode of all time, with phenomenal acting involved from all cast members.  The limerick Data gives to Picard about the person from Venus having a big you-know-what is TIMELESS!  Being such a huge Captain Picard fan, his acting in this episode made me think to myself, ""Was he on drugs before he read the script?""  Superb acting!For example, just look at the scene where he and Dr. Crusher are in the ready room discussing the virus and those infected.  When Picard and Crusher get really close to each other face-to-face, I MUST ASK YOU ALL THIS QUESTION:  what is the sound Picard makes coming from his throat???  You actually see his throat move a bit and something like ""huhuhuhuhuhu"" comes out.  It can't be a laugh because it's misplaced.  The sound just doesn't fit there!!  If anyone can give me a reason for this, I'd LOVE to know!The only other episode that can compare with this episode is ""Chain of Command Parts 1 and 2.""

""Pop Culture Addict""","[4, 5]","It is still not clear whether ""The Naked Now"" was meant to be a homage to the original Star Trek episode ""The Naked Time,"" a sequel to that episode, or whether it was just a plain repeat performance of it, but it is clear that this was one of the less inspired episodes of the first season.After beaming over to the derelict U.S.S. Tsiolkovsky, Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) starts to exhibit some curious behavior upon returning to the Enterprise-D.  It turns out that LaForge has become infected by a substance that causes anyone infected by it to lose their inhibitions.  Eventually most of the Enterprise's crew becomes infected and the ship is placed in imminent danger as it finds itself in close proximity to a collapsing star with its engines disabled.The decision to go with this story so early in Star Trek: The Next Generation's run seems a little puzzling.  ""The Naked Time"" was noteworthy because it showed viewers aspects of Captain Kirk's crew that we had never been privy to before.  However, since most of the characterizations of the Next Generation's crew had not been firmly established yet, showing the ""other"" sides of these characters had a rather muted dramatic effect since we were not yet used to the ""normal"" personas of these characters.

Oh forgit, Troi also, but we already knew she had a thing for Riker.The interaction was funny especially between Crusher and Picard., despite their &quot;snootful&quot; they still went above and beyond the call of duty.I also recommend: Code of Honor, Devil's Due and my favorite Menange A Troi.",5,"If  you prick me, do I not leak?",1090800000,"07 26, 2004",2004,844,"['course', 'what', 'Data', 'Picard', 'when', 'Picard', 'can', 't', 'believe', 'Data', 'quot', 'intoxicated', 'quot', 'think', 'was', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'serious', 'episode', 'Yes', 'theme', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'notthe', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'remade', 'idea', 'story.Partcularly', 'liked', 'interaction', 'crew', 'members', 'showing', 'hidden', 'side', 'course', 'Wesley', 'be', 'captiain', 'Beverly', 'crushing', 'want', 'Captain', 'Picard', 'Tasha', 'well', 'know', 'Data', 'even', 'ebing', 'android', 'showed', 'side', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'Oh', 'forgit', 'Troi', 'also', 'already', 'knew', 'had', 'thing', 'Riker.The', 'interaction', 'was', 'funny', 'especially', 'Crusher', 'Picard.', 'quot', 'snootful', 'quot', 'still', 'went', 'call', 'duty.I', 'also', 'recommend', 'Code', 'Honor', 'Devil', 'Due', 'favorite', 'Menange', 'A', 'Troi']","Star Trek - The Next Generation, Episode 3: The Naked Now VHS"

Officially is is listed as episode 3 because the pilot episode was a 2 part or &quot;double&quot; episode.This episode is a spin-off of the TOS episode &quot;The Naked Time&quot; Basically the same type of thing happens. In this episode the Enterprise meets up with the U.S.S. Tsiolkovsky, in observing a star that is about to go nova (Named after the great Russian physicist and rocket scientist, Konstantin Eduardovich Tsiolkovsky if you look closely you will notice that one of the plaques on the ship is written in Russian) The crew is acting in a strange manner. They then, in their drunken-like state blow out the hatch, decompressing much of the ship. The Enterprise crewbeams over to find the ship is a mess. The entire crew is dead, there are clothes strewn all over the corridors, naked people in one of the crew quarters with the environmental controls set to a winter-like condition. One crew member is found in a shower stall fully-clothed. The Enterprise crew returns to their ship and the ship is contaminated.The Transporter's Bio filter and decontamination is unable to filter out the contaminant. It is a set of water-based molecules that are in a chemical like state that when passed on to a human, will affect the human body like alcohol. Now eventually the whole crew becomes &quot;drunk&quot;, the star is about to go nova at any minute and the ship's controls have been taken over by Wesley!This is a great episode and in it we leard about Data's full functionality. and the &quot;multiple techniques&quot; he is programmed with.

The story opens with a Federation science vessel, the U.S.S. Tsiolkovsky, studying a star, on the verge of going supernova.  During the mission, the crew of the ship is exhibiting strange behavior, until one person of the crew blows a emergency hatch, killing the Tsiolkovsky's entire crew. The U.S.S.
