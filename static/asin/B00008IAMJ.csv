There are no Led Zeppelin moments or Ziggy's hopping around in mascara.  This band is a bunch of regular Joes who just happen to be extremely talented.  The director certainly picked an opportune time to begin filming them because the release and marketing of ""Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"" became a major drama that ultimately ended in the band making a fortune.  The CD's subtle brilliance was lost on their former label and the recording sessions also saw Mr. Tweedy unceremoniously cut Jay Bennett from the lineup.  I could not help but feel sorry for Bennett as there did not appear to much explanation for the rift other than Jeff Tweedy's need to possess complete control over the band.  Bennett's ability to challenge Tweedy seemed to be the reason why he was thrown out of Wilco.  My only criticism of the film, and it's a minor one, is that it would have been nice to know more about why such a skilled musician was cast off.

742872,ANBSW3BALFRR2,B00008IAMJ,Chet Fakir,"[4, 4]","This package is fantastic, not only do you get the original documentary movie filmed during the recording of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, but you get a second DVD with deleted scenes and 17 extra songs. You can choose to watch the the scenes or just watch the live performances, many of which are Jeff Tweedy playing a solo acoustic show.The first DVD contains the original documentary. Shot in grainy black and white, it brings you into Wilco's somewhat disfunctional world as they labor over the recording of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. The intraband tensions and humorous interplay between the members is fascinating as are the interviews with Wilco's manager. The focus though is mainly on the relationship between Jeff Tweedy and his bandmate Jay Bennet. (What is it about Tweedy and his inability to get along with guys named Jay?) It's the creative tension and the ultimate outcome of their relationship that is the most compelling story concerning the band, label troubles notwithstanding. Label troubles they have no shortage of... A day after YHF is delivered, Reprise Records dumps Wilco, but gives the recording to the band without any further financial obligation! Leaving Wilco essentially free to sign to another label with finished product ready for release. As we know the movie has a happy ending.I Am Trying To Break Your Heart is a very interesting portrait of a band in flux and the difficulty of creating art within the confines of music industry expectations and demands. The filmaker states that he had no idea half the band would be fired and Wilco would find itself labeless before the project's end. He certainly got more than he bargained for and a much more compelling movie than if everthing went smoothly.But story aside, it's really the music that makes this movie as great as it is. We see Wilco both in the studio recording and on the stage playing spirited live versions of many of the songs on YHF. This band is a powerhouse live too. There are plenty of Jeff Tweedy solo acoustic performances as well, either on stage or in more candid moments.I Am Trying To Break Your Heart is highly recommended to anyone interested in the personalities and problems behind music making, the pitfalls associated with the creative process, music industry crapola, and of course fans of Wilco. There's an honesty about these guys that helps to make their story that much more interesting and human. This DVD made me a believer.

Wilco ensemble pieces, in the studio, and on stage, are flawless rock and roll songs delivered with a raw energy of unified musicianship, certainly the music is the best thing about ""Break Your Heart"". The discretionary camera has no qualms filming Wilco lead Jeff Tweedy vomitting in the bathroom as the pressure of the album becomes strained, but we only hear of guitarist Jeff Bennett's dismissal from the band in it's aftermath, the undocumented heave-ho is looked back upon like the passing of a friend. Although there is cause to celebrate when the album is finally released to glowing reviews, the justification of it's success is tarnished when ""Foxtrot"" is finally released by the same corporation who owns Reprise. There's no great evil-doer here, except maybe Tweedy himself, who justifiably retains artistic control over his band, and seems delighted when Bennett is no longer a member of Wilco. The money from the album still goes into another pocket of giant Warner Brothers music. What is interesting is that Warner Brothers Records even temporarily chooses not to release what will become a  worthwile longstanding profit, while probably at the same time, released scores of less profiteering material from flash-in-the-pan artists.

742877,A1IANEBSMVGHS9,B00008IAMJ,"Manny Hernandez ""@askmanny""","[9, 12]","This fantastic DVD documentary basically shows the Chicago-based band through the process of creating their landmark album ""Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"" under the umbrella of Reprise Records (a Time Warner company). You are exposed to some of their internal struggles as a creative unit with clashing egos as well as their exhilarating process by which the build up their songs to later deconstruct them to explore what's possible with them.The band gets dumped by Reprise when they deliver the finished album, and the second half of the documentary focuses on this process, along with how they come out of the situation essentially unscathed, with a finished album that they were able to take to another label (Nonesuch, another Time Warner company). This part of the film really takes a lot of points home, questioning the time pressures and business considerations involved in the making of an album (or a piece of art, for that matter), and how they essentially go against some of the basic principes of creative work.As a fan of the band, I found the DVD very insighful.

What he ended up with is so much more. We get to see the album, 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot' get made but along the way we not only see band members dropped, but also our band from their label. The black and white film ends up an interesting combination of all the above and provides not only an essential insight to how bands make records (and unmake themselves) but also the saddening state of the corporate goliath that is the record industry.The story of 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot' is now one of legend, a legend sure to grow. Wilco singer-songwriter Jeff Tweedy, guitar and keyboard specialist Jay Bennett, bassist John Stirratt, multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach, and new drummer Glenn Kotche)  were given artistic freedom to record and produce the record themselves in their Chicago loft and they took full advantage of it as the record is a definite sonic evolution from their previous efforts that gets more interesting on each listen. Hopes were high and they really felt Reprise Records was really behind this effort. They completed it and turned it over only to get silence from their label, in were in the middle of a management shakeup. Reprise labeled it career ending and demanded change. Wilco and their manager Tony Margherita would do no such thing and wanted out and Reprise was happy to oblige. Wilco was a free agent with a completed record and a full list of suitors after them so to say they felt liberated is an understatement. Irony plays out quite well and the band settles on Nonesuch records, who happens to be a subsidiary of Time Warner, who also owns Reprise. To top it off the record was hailed as a modern masterpiece and will probably be even more celebrated in times to come (which the documentary notes).The best part of the documentary is that you don't have to be a Wilco expert to sympathize with the band or fall in love with their music. I'd almost guarantee that after seeing it you'll be dying to hear more from them. Jeff Tweedy's shy, personable nature is ideal for this type of project and it's impossible not to be on his side as he not only battles the record company, but also as his relationship with fellow band mate Bennett deteriorates to the point where Tweedy asks him to leave. Tweedy is by far the one member of Wilco we really get to know and by the end you realize the pressure put on him and what a talent he is to continue to succeed. Tweedy (and Wilco) are not only survivors, but winners and the fact that they come out of mess so well is a tribute to them.The DVD has a nice commentary with the director and band, which helps lend insight to a lot of what was going on.

Loved it from start to finish. For whatever reason, I never bought the DVD when it came out, until a couple of weeks ago and so this was my first time re-watching the movie, 5 years later.DVD1 (92 min.) of ""I Am Trying To Break Your Heart"" brings the original theatrical release, and re-watching it 5 years later, and knowing full-well the story that it brings, it remains a marvel to watch. Originally intended as simply following how the band makes a new album, it turns into a full fletched drama (band members leaving, label rejecting the album, the band persevering, etc.). One hilarious moment that remains with me is when the band is on the road and Jeff Tweedy and his family walks into a fast-food place and he says ""I don't have any money"". It's probably not that they were broke, but it's probably not too far from the truth either... Since those days of course, the band has become a huge success.DVD2 (80 min.) brings a bunch of scenes that weren't included in the movie, including the band performing in various places and settings.

742884,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B00008IAMJ,P Magnum,"[16, 16]","I Am Trying To Break Your Heart is a brilliant documentary by director Sam Jones in which he follows the critically acclaimed band Wilco in the process of recording their fourth album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.  The film opens on an optimistic note as the band is in the their own recording studio cutting the record.  Mr. Jones couldn't have written a more dramatic turn of events when the band presents the album to their label, Reprise, they hate the album and demand changes.  When the band refuses to make changes, Reprise, essentially drops them and releases them from their contract.  This event became big news in the business and Wilco had the great luck to have a bad situation turn golden when companies got into bidding war for their services.  They eventually signed with Nonesuch and the album was released to massive critical praise.  The irony of the situation is that both labels were owned by Time-Warner who paid for the album twice.  Also, there are some tensions in the band between leader Jeff Tweedy and guitarist and keyboardist Jay Bennett.  You don't see any overt animosity between the two other than a scene in which there is a disagreement regarding the mixing of a song (""Heavy Metal Drummer"") that is filled with tension, but the resulting parting of the ways adds even more dramatic flavor to the film.  Mr. Tweedy is the main force behind Wilco and he dominates the film as well. He provides the most commentary by far and his image is the most widely shown.  This film isn't a Behind The Music style expose, the band seem like a normal bunch of guys.  No wild partying, just five (and then four) musicians trying to craft an ambitious album.  The film has a nice number of live concert performances that are nicely interspersed throughout the film.  Mr. Jones shot the film in a grainy black & white that is a nice touch, but it would have been a good idea if he introduced a little color into the film especially in the concert footage.  That is just a minor quibble as I Am Trying To Break Your Heart is a first rate documentary that is a must for any Wilco fan.  The bonus disk has numerous outtakes as well as an uncut version of the solo performance in San Francisco by Mr. Tweedy that is featured in the film.",5,Roger Wilco,1051747200,"05 1, 2003",2003,2245,"['Am', 'Trying', 'Break', 'Heart', 'brilliant', 'documentary', 'director', 'Sam', 'Jones', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'band', 'Wilco', 'process', 'recording', 'fourth', 'album', 'Yankee', 'Hotel', 'Foxtrot', 'film', 'optimistic', 'note', 'band', 'own', 'recording', 'studio', 'cutting', 'record', 'Mr.', 'Jones', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'written', 'more', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'events', 'when', 'band', 'album', 'label', 'Reprise', 'hate', 'album', 'demand', 'changes', 'When', 'band', 'make', 'changes', 'Reprise', 'essentially', 'releases', 'contract', 'event', 'became', 'big', 'news', 'business', 'Wilco', 'had', 'great', 'luck', 'have', 'bad', 'situation', 'turn', 'golden', 'when', 'companies', 'got', 'bidding', 'war', 'services', 'eventually', 'signed', 'Nonesuch', 'album', 'was', 'released', 'massive', 'critical', 'praise', 'irony', 'situation', 'labels', 'were', 'owned', 'Time-Warner', 'who', 'paid', 'album', 'twice', 'Also', 'are', 'tensions', 'band', 'leader', 'Jeff', 'Tweedy', 'guitarist', 'keyboardist', 'Jay', 'Bennett', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'overt', 'animosity', 'two', 'other', 'scene', 'disagreement', 'regarding', 'mixing', 'song', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'Drummer', 'filled', 'tension', 'resulting', 'parting', 'ways', 'even', 'more', 'dramatic', 'flavor', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Tweedy', 'main', 'force', 'Wilco', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'commentary', 'far', 'image', 'most', 'widely', 'shown', 'film', ""n't"", 'Music', 'style', 'expose', 'band', 'seem', 'normal', 'bunch', 'guys', 'wild', 'partying', 'just', 'five', 'then', 'four', 'musicians', 'trying', 'craft', 'ambitious', 'album', 'film', 'nice', 'number', 'live', 'concert', 'performances', 'are', 'nicely', 'interspersed', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Jones', 'shot', 'film', 'grainy', 'black', 'white', 'nice', 'touch', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'idea', 'introduced', 'little', 'color', 'film', 'especially', 'concert', 'footage', 'just', 'minor', 'quibble', 'Am', 'Trying', 'Break', 'Heart', 'first', 'rate', 'documentary', 'must', 'Wilco', 'fan', 'bonus', 'disk', 'numerous', 'outtakes', 'as', 'well', 'uncut', 'version', 'solo', 'performance', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Mr.', 'Tweedy', 'featured', 'film']",N/A
742885,A2TX79GR278JMA,B00008IAMJ,P. Opus,"[4, 4]","Although Yankee Hotel Foxtrot has been among my top-ten records of all time since I picked up a copy shortly after its initial release, I waited almost 5 years to see this documentary film about the album (released in 2003).  Why?  For one thing, the album speaks very loudly and boldly for itself.  When I heard about the documentary I was resistant to add any more information to the process of understanding this album for fear of detracting from the experience.  However this week I finally caved.  The album has grown with me so much over time I really wanted to learn more about its creation.I am hardly an objective viewer and I think I would have enjoyed any film containing the music from the album, but there were some elements that really stood out to make the viewing experience impactful.  First was the footage of the band's creative process, developing the material as a unit.  I was surprised in fact how well the band interacted as a group (at least at first), when I had always thought of Tweedy as more of a type-A.  Additionally, live footage abounded, and there were some very nice performances of ""Being There""-era material that reminded me why that album was so much fun.  Despite the new emphasis on deconstructionism, the band never lost its ability to ""rock"" in a more conventional sense.  I think this speaks highly for their versatility.  Further, David Fricke (of Rolling Stone) and others contributed some very thought-provoking discussion of the clash between art and commerce in the modern music industry.  The struggles surrounding this album can in fact be seen as a microcosm of a larger problem impacting artistically ambitious musicians in an era where the public's attention span for such things is shrinking. This in fact points the way towards the rise of indie labels devoted to ""career artists"" which seems to be occurring right now.  Finally, the film had a distinct plot with obstacles to overcome (the band being dropped by its label) and a happy ending (owning creative rights to an album funded by a large label and essentially selling it back to them at a higher cost).  In true rock n roll fashion, Wilco ""stuck it to the man.""The drawbacks?  The main one was the focus on the falling out between Jeff Tweedy and Jay Bennett.  It was hilarious to see Bennett's explanation of the ouster (a defensive statement boiling down to: ""Tweedy was threatened by my brilliance"") yet it also cast him in the worst light possible, lampooning his arrogance to make it seem almost cartoonish.  I am sure there was more to the story than we were shown.  Additionally, Jeff and Jay's discussion over the details of the sounds coming through the mixing boards was excruciating (and fortunately pretty short).  It reminded me of watching my parents argue when I was a kid - they obviously both saw the world from a different perspective and it seemed like they just weren't going to see eye-to-eye on certain things.  I can see why Jeff had to throw up after that discussion, I wanted to as well.  This part was a little too close to reality TV drama for my liking.However this is small potatoes in the grand scheme of things, and the film did achieve its purpose - to help the viewer gain more perspective on the album and the process of its development.  It also cast the band in a very human light, as fundamentally regular people working together to create a significant artistic statement.  I learned a lot about Jeff Tweedy and crew but not so much so as to make me feel like some kind of voyeur - in other words, the band's personal life was largely left untouched and the focus was placed where it should have been - squarely on the music.

So I'm ill-equipped to say how good this look behind the scenes actually is.  To me, it's incredible.  I've been listening to YHF for about a year, and complete familiarity with the work still eludes me.  Luckily, because it's that fresh sound that brought me to the band in the first place.  Anyway, I'm still completing my YHF thesis, and this is the ultimate study sheet.  The boys, experimenting with the songs on creation, even as I experiment with them on consumption.  It's too much, riches beyond belief.I haven't investigated the genesis of this project, but it appears that the filmmakers were extremely lucky.  What should have been just another band profile wound up having an arc -- not just one, but two major (and completely unforeseeable) plot points.  The fiasco with WB and Wilco's new album, and the ejection of Jay Bennett from the band.  The latter worked especially well for me, as every appearance of Bennett made his neediness more transparent.  One scene in particular is painful to watch, as Bennett is relentless in having not just his views, but every syllable of the discussion, put under the microscope.  It's easy to see how Jeff Tweedy may have decided that this collaboration had outlived its usefulness.I'm not sure how well this movie would work for the uninitiated, or for non-fans.  I don't believe that Wilco is necessarily an acquired taste -- I was hooked from my first notes -- but I do think they're a band that won't work for everyone.  Tweedy's reedy voice is not the strongest instrument out there, and the band's arrangements are idiosyncratic, to say the least.  If you like them, I think you'll really like them.  And if you don't, you may well wonder what the fuss is about.  In the music and, especially, this film.  Which takes their uniqueness for granted, as principle #1.  If you don't get it, this film may be a tedious exercise, at best.  I don't know.  This movie was made for me, and I bought it all.And, hey, as a spoiled Wilco fan, I'm looking forward to the sequel.  The making of ""A Ghost is Born""?  Where do I find that?

She was not a Wilco fan at all, but she enjoyed this film as much as I did. The band come over as funny and charming folks, and Jeff Tweedy shows good grace during what was a traumatic time for the band. This film shows the ups as well the downs and moves along at a good pace never testing the audiences patience. Of course the music is fantastic throughout and the film is beautifully shot in black and white. I remember being so excited when I heard that this film was going to be made and when it finally did come out it was everything I had hoped it would be and more.

742889,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00008IAMJ,Robert Moore,"[7, 7]","For some reason that I can't understand, for over three years I've known about this documentary, knew it was highly regarded, and loved the ablum YANKEE HOTEL FOXTROT, and yet did not see this until recently.  Now that I've seen it, I'm more perplexed than ever as to why I didn't.  For one thing, it is a Chicago film, where I live, and might be a neighborhood film (I think their loft is a few blocks from where I live).There are three things that make this a marvelous film.  First, it is great to look at.  Photographer Sam Jones made his film debut making this, and it is obvious throughout that it was made by someone with a great eye.  He frames his subjects with care, and he also shows great sensitivity in filming the city.  Forget all those feature films shot in Chicago:  this is what Chicago really looks like, from the early shots along Lake Shore Drive to the ending shot with the guys walking along the lake beside Adler Planetarium (though the latter is not shown), this is the real Chicago.  The second reason the documentary shines is the sound.  The band sounds great every time you hear them, whether just jerking around or rehearsing or performing on stage or recording in their loft.  You can hear why they are a great band from beginning to end.  Some documentaries manage to botch the live sound, but in performances here the band is sharp and compelling.  The third reason it is a great film is the story, which certainly couldn't have been anticipated at the outset.  Jeff Tweedy had been critics' darling from his days as co-leader of Uncle Tupelo (the other co-leader, Jay Farrer, formed Son Volt while Tweedy formed Wilco), and there was a sense that their upcoming album was going to break new ground.  The result was an album that was sparer and more minimalistic than previous efforts.  Heavily rhythmic, yet allowing silences and spaces where other performers would succumb to the temptation to fill everything with sounds, the songs on the album often seem to contain the minimum amount of embellishment to achieve the desired effect.  Although the album would go on to tremendous critical acclaim (it would named the #1 album of 2002 in the prestigious Village Voice Pazz and Jop Poll, which is more impressive than any Grammy award since it is a poll conducted with literally hundreds of top music critics), the record label was underwhelmed, and fired Wilco after the band refused to rerecord parts to make it more commercial.  The irony is that after the underground buzz built about the album, they managed to resell the album for a different Time-Warner subsidiary for three times the amount Warners-Reprise originally spent in having it made.Apart from the immense entertainment value of the film the documentary raises anew an issue that continually arises these days when downloading and file sharing are restructing the entire industry:  What is the point of record companies?  They obviously are not crucial in maintaining the artistic integrity of the music nor are they key in developing talent.  Nor do they make the individual bands much money.  I heard another Chicago musician, Billy Corgan, on local NPR state that even his Smashing Pumpkins made very little money off album sales.  It is the rare band that doesn't make the vast bulk of its income from live performances.  Essentially, record companies continue to provide only two services:  PR and record distribution.  My own belief is that record companies are entities that have largely become irrelevant.  Their demise would necessitate some new arrangement of how music is distributed and promoted--i.e., if a great new band records killer music, how will I hear about it--but I think there is a very good chance that in a couple of decades that record companies as we have known them will have largely ceased to exist.  And good riddance.I'm sure most people who are serious fans of contemporary music have already seen this.  But if there are a few unfortunates such as I was myself until recently, this truly is on the short list of must-see rock documentaries.  If you haven't seen it, see it now.",5,A beautifully photographed documentary about a seminal rock band,1125187200,"08 28, 2005",2005,4112,"['reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'three', 'years', ""'ve"", 'known', 'documentary', 'knew', 'was', 'highly', 'regarded', 'loved', 'ablum', 'YANKEE', 'HOTEL', 'FOXTROT', 'yet', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'recently', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'m"", 'more', 'perplexed', 'ever', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'one', 'thing', 'Chicago', 'film', 'where', 'live', 'might', 'be', 'neighborhood', 'film', 'think', 'loft', 'few', 'blocks', 'where', 'live', 'are', 'three', 'things', 'make', 'marvelous', 'film', 'First', 'great', 'look', 'Photographer', 'Sam', 'Jones', 'made', 'film', 'debut', 'making', 'obvious', 'was', 'made', 'someone', 'great', 'eye', 'subjects', 'care', 'also', 'great', 'sensitivity', 'filming', 'city', 'Forget', 'feature', 'films', 'shot', 'Chicago', 'what', 'Chicago', 'really', 'early', 'shots', 'Lake', 'Shore', 'Drive', 'ending', 'shot', 'guys', 'walking', 'lake', 'beside', 'Adler', 'Planetarium', 'latter', 'not', 'shown', 'real', 'Chicago', 'second', 'reason', 'documentary', 'shines', 'sound', 'band', 'great', 'time', 'hear', 'just', 'jerking', 'around', 'rehearsing', 'performing', 'stage', 'recording', 'loft', 'can', 'hear', 'why', 'are', 'great', 'band', 'beginning', 'end', 'documentaries', 'manage', 'botch', 'live', 'sound', 'performances', 'here', 'band', 'sharp', 'compelling', 'third', 'reason', 'great', 'film', 'story', 'certainly', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'anticipated', 'outset', 'Jeff', 'Tweedy', 'had', 'been', 'critics', 'darling', 'days', 'co-leader', 'Uncle', 'Tupelo', 'other', 'co-leader', 'Jay', 'Farrer', 'formed', 'Son', 'Volt', 'Tweedy', 'formed', 'Wilco', 'there', 'was', 'sense', 'upcoming', 'album', 'was', 'going', 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'result', 'was', 'album', 'was', 'sparer', 'more', 'minimalistic', 'previous', 'efforts', 'Heavily', 'rhythmic', 'yet', 'allowing', 'silences', 'spaces', 'where', 'other', 'performers', 'would', 'succumb', 'temptation', 'fill', 'everything', 'sounds', 'songs', 'album', 'often', 'seem', 'contain', 'minimum', 'amount', 'embellishment', 'achieve', 'desired', 'effect', 'album', 'would', 'go', 'tremendous', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'would', 'named', '1', 'album', '2002', 'prestigious', 'Village', 'Voice', 'Pazz', 'Jop', 'Poll', 'more', 'impressive', 'Grammy', 'award', 'poll', 'conducted', 'literally', 'hundreds', 'top', 'music', 'critics', 'record', 'label', 'was', 'underwhelmed', 'fired', 'Wilco', 'band', 'refused', 'rerecord', 'parts', 'make', 'more', 'commercial', 'irony', 'underground', 'buzz', 'built', 'album', 'managed', 'resell', 'album', 'different', 'Time-Warner', 'subsidiary', 'three', 'times', 'amount', 'Warners-Reprise', 'originally', 'spent', 'having', 'made.Apart', 'immense', 'entertainment', 'value', 'film', 'documentary', 'anew', 'issue', 'continually', 'days', 'when', 'downloading', 'file', 'sharing', 'are', 'restructing', 'entire', 'industry', 'What', 'point', 'record', 'companies', 'obviously', 'are', 'not', 'crucial', 'maintaining', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'music', 'are', 'key', 'developing', 'talent', 'do', 'make', 'individual', 'bands', 'much', 'money', 'heard', 'Chicago', 'musician', 'Billy', 'Corgan', 'local', 'NPR', 'state', 'even', 'Smashing', 'Pumpkins', 'made', 'very', 'little', 'money', 'album', 'sales', 'rare', 'band', ""n't"", 'make', 'vast', 'bulk', 'income', 'live', 'performances', 'Essentially', 'record', 'companies', 'continue', 'provide', 'only', 'two', 'services', 'PR', 'record', 'distribution', 'own', 'belief', 'record', 'companies', 'are', 'entities', 'have', 'largely', 'become', 'irrelevant', 'demise', 'would', 'necessitate', 'new', 'arrangement', 'how', 'music', 'distributed', 'promoted', 'i.e.', 'great', 'new', 'band', 'records', 'killer', 'music', 'how', 'will', 'hear', 'think', 'very', 'good', 'chance', 'couple', 'decades', 'record', 'companies', 'have', 'known', 'will', 'have', 'largely', 'ceased', 'exist', 'good', 'riddance.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'serious', 'fans', 'contemporary', 'music', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'are', 'few', 'unfortunates', 'such', 'was', 'recently', 'truly', 'short', 'list', 'must-see', 'rock', 'documentaries', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'see', 'now']",N/A
