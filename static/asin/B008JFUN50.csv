1554924,A1QMKAH64799OP,B008JFUN50,Aggressive Arms,"[7, 14]","This is a rip-roaring action picture, and the most overtly political SF I've ever seen, which is fine by me, so long as the heart is in the right place. And here it is.In his ""Discourse on Inequality,"" Rousseau holds in essence that inequality develops from the first perceived differences among men, and then is secured by those favored by such perceptions; thereafter inequality begets development and corruption which beget further inequality which begets development and corruption, and so on. The world of 2154, as imagined in ""Elysium,"" is as if Rousseau were confirmed, and apparently by a pessimist to boot. The rich have left the ravaged Earth and its poor behind, to live on a space station, where they hoard all the resources, especially health care. But by the end of the picture we see that writer/director Neill Blomkamp has a more optimistic view of humanity and technology, and the capacity of the latter to serve noble aims. Along the way there are vicious parodies of contemporary inequality, the paranoid security state, the hyper-punitive criminal justice system, immigration paranoia -- pretty much everything out there deserving righteous indignation.The plot is driven by action sequences almost as much as its central idea. If you think you've seen every gunfight, swordfight, and fistfight you'll ever want to see at the movies, then skip this, because it's got plenty. I thought they were tremendous, tense and involving, with inventive technology. In that regard, I'd say it's up there with the best of them, the best being probably ""Aliens"" and ""District 9."" A comment from another reviewer here, in a generally strong review, suggested that he was less impressed by the weaponry in this film than by ""District 9."" I respectfully disagree: Just as in Blomkamp's breakout film, ""Elysium"" is substantially enhanced by imaginative fight sequences and futuristic weaponry.Matt Damon does a fine job, even if he's never challenged much by the script. Jodie Foster on the other hand is quite awkward, as if she was nervous or something during the making of it. It's a minor complaint though.The film isn't subtle, and the broad arc of the storyline is of course predictable (though among genre pics, whose isn't?), but the several steps along the way are not. Anyhow it's not for everyone, but if you've been considering seeing it, don't let the criticism discourage you; see for yourself.",4,"Overtly political SF, with tremendous action",1376179200,"08 11, 2013",2013,2411,"['rip-roaring', 'action', 'picture', 'most', 'overtly', 'political', 'SF', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'fine', 'so', 'long', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'here', 'Discourse', 'Inequality', 'Rousseau', 'essence', 'inequality', 'first', 'perceived', 'differences', 'men', 'then', 'secured', 'favored', 'such', 'perceptions', 'thereafter', 'inequality', 'begets', 'development', 'corruption', 'beget', 'further', 'inequality', 'development', 'corruption', 'so', 'world', '2154', 'imagined', 'Elysium', 'Rousseau', 'were', 'confirmed', 'apparently', 'pessimist', 'boot', 'rich', 'have', 'left', 'ravaged', 'Earth', 'poor', 'behind', 'live', 'space', 'station', 'where', 'hoard', 'resources', 'especially', 'health', 'care', 'end', 'picture', 'see', 'writer/director', 'Neill', 'Blomkamp', 'more', 'optimistic', 'view', 'humanity', 'technology', 'capacity', 'latter', 'serve', 'noble', 'aims', 'way', 'are', 'vicious', 'parodies', 'contemporary', 'inequality', 'paranoid', 'security', 'state', 'hyper-punitive', 'criminal', 'justice', 'system', 'immigration', 'paranoia', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'there', 'deserving', 'righteous', 'indignation.The', 'plot', 'driven', 'action', 'sequences', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'central', 'idea', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'gunfight', 'swordfight', 'fistfight', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'want', 'see', 'movies', 'then', 'skip', 'got', 'plenty', 'thought', 'were', 'tremendous', 'tense', 'involving', 'inventive', 'technology', 'regard', ""'d"", 'say', 'up', 'there', 'best', 'best', 'being', 'probably', 'Aliens', 'District', '9', 'comment', 'reviewer', 'here', 'generally', 'strong', 'review', 'suggested', 'was', 'less', 'impressed', 'weaponry', 'film', 'District', '9', 'respectfully', 'disagree', 'Just', 'Blomkamp', 'breakout', 'film', 'Elysium', 'substantially', 'enhanced', 'imaginative', 'fight', 'sequences', 'futuristic', 'weaponry.Matt', 'Damon', 'fine', 'job', 'even', 'never', 'challenged', 'much', 'script', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'other', 'hand', 'quite', 'awkward', 'was', 'nervous', 'something', 'making', 'minor', 'complaint', 'though.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'subtle', 'broad', 'arc', 'storyline', 'course', 'predictable', 'genre', 'pics', ""n't"", 'several', 'steps', 'way', 'are', 'not', 'Anyhow', 'not', 'everyone', ""'ve"", 'been', 'considering', 'seeing', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'criticism', 'discourage', 'see']",N/A

It deals with immigration in an interesting fashion, the salient point being that separating the wealthy from the poor with several kilometers of outer space will not stop the influx of immigrants. Nothing would stop the have nots from wanting a better life, so any argument about the legality of immigration is pointless. What makes Elysium fun are the little details and the awesome screen-devouring presence of Sharlto Copley as Kruger. Sporting a thick Afrikaans accent and a riot of armaments, Kruger appears as likely to murder the audience as those on screen with him. Despite having a military ship and his own private army, he spends his days wearing a cloth sack and rooting through garbage for food.

There is no explanation of why Los Angeles is impoverished and Elysium (the space station the LA denizens try to sneak into) is wealthy. The movie synopsis mentions ""pollution"" and LA is indeed polluted, but not just environmentally. The future Los Angeles is polluted demographically with defective people.The movie is an allegory for illegal immigration. The people on Elysium live in a nice, civilized place (like the people in first-world countries), while the people in Los Angeles live savagely and irresponsibly (like the people from third-world countries who illegally enter first-world countries). And like today's third-world refuse, the people of Los Angeles make no effort to transform their own situation. They simply observe that life is better on Elysium and try to sneak aboard to take advantage of its resources. Well, what would happen if everyone in LA could enter Elysium with no problem? That's where the movie leaves off. There is no epilogue to describe what life is like on Elysium in the years after ""amnesty"" has been granted.When the guy who helps Matt Damon's character break into Elysium reprograms the ship's computers, everyone in LA is instantly given access to Elysium. The original people of Elysium are no longer ""privileged"" to live there. But this is surely going to transfer LA's problems to Elysium. The ship has limited resources and LA has untold millions of people. Elysium is a nicer place than LA (it is unpolluted), so the people of LA will want to live there. Elysium was designed to house the pre-amnesty population, not the population of Los Angeles, so there will be overcrowding. And what will people do while they're waiting to be housed?I suppose if Elysium wound up like LA in 2154--run-down and overcrowded--it would be a perverse form of justice to the filmmakers because they think the people of Elysium don't deserve to live that way.

Those that gave this a 3 star rating I would guess enjoyed the movie but felt it wasn't realistic. Yet the science in this movie is exactly what is in the early stages of being developed and exactly what humanity (what exists of it) will be capable of in 1-2 centuries. However the truth behind this movie is that the poor will never see a future that the rich will see. This rings true right now today. My guess is if you rated it 1 star you are incapable of looking through the looking glass because you live in the social class that is not serving those with means on this Earth.

1554964,A12UB42W3M4FTS,B008JFUN50,Avid Reader,"[7, 11]","Before I get into the main part of the review, I have a question.  Where is everyone else in the world?  It seems to the writer, only Hispanics matter.  It seems self-centered and ego-centric to me.  I wonder if the writer can even partially fathom the poverty, disease, and starvation in other parts of the world, such as parts of India and Africa to just name a couple.  It seems sad to me that the entire world is depicted as mainly being Hispanic.  It makes me sad to know that people can have such a limited view of the world in which we live.  I suggest those who do think this way take a moment to google starvation Africa and starvation India, look at the articles stating the numbers, and click on images to see the suffering of the people.  There is no excuse for ignoring everyone else on the planet except Hispanics/Latinos.Now, on to the review.I love sci-fi movies, and I enjoy movies trying to make a statement, such as District 9.  While this movie attempted to do both, it failed at both.  I wanted to like it.  Matt Damon and Jodi Foster?  Talented actors.  Except this time around.The movie was about Caucasian haves and mainly Hispanic and Caucasian have-nots.  I think it was meant to make some kind of point about some kind of injustice; however, it never explained the injustice, made its point, or explained the motivations of the haves and have nots or the history of both worlds.  Haves were cruel apparently for no reason.  Have-nots wanted a cure-all medical device that the haves had.  Why did only the haves gain access to the machine?  Was it astronomically expensive?  Was it made from rare metals?  We will never know.  We only know they had it, and out of the cruelness of their evil little shriveled hearts, they were not going to share it with the have-nots.  I would have liked some background and a richer more developed story and characters.  It was very superficial.  It was supposedly about a deep subject, but it was so superficial that it completely missed the mark.The writing was so bad that it made Matt Damon and Jody Foster seem like the worst actors ever.I don't have much else to say about this movie, except to advise that if you watch it, turn off the sound and multi-task.-------------------------------------Added:  As some do not think this review was helpful, I will add to it to explain further:The characters in the movie are one-dimensional; Jodi Foster's is the most one-dimensional character.  In addition, her accent was atrocious.Now if my review was down-rated due to any political beliefs of the down-raters, I must add that I do feel the people in the movie should have been more diverse.  You may believe that Hispanics are the only people in poverty in the entire world, but you are wrong if you believe that.  This movie was about the entire world of Earth containing have-nots, and the space station above earth containing the haves.  The people of Earth were Hispanic, except for a couple of white guys and one black guy, basically.  Well, I happen to believe that there are poor of all races, cultures and national origins.  Poverty is not reserved specifically for Hispanics.  There are poor Africans, poor Asians, poor peoples of India, poor American Indians, poor middle eastern peoples, poor black people, poor Celts, poor Aussies, poor Russians, poor Europeans, poor gypsies, etc.  Yes, there are even poverty stricken Caucasians.I think it is over-simplistic and wrong to attempt to portray the world as good, poor Hispanics v.s. evil, wealthy Caucasians.If you believe in the 99% as many with positive reviews do, then you must know Caucasians are included in the 99%; the 99%ers are not Hispanic only.This movie was supposedly about the entire world, yet ignored most of the peoples of the world.I do think the plot was badly written.  I do think the acting was one-dimensional.I also think the story did not draw the watcher in, because it did not explain anything about how the planet became like this or have fully developed characters.  Why can't the people of Earth plant, farm, and make and improve the planet?  Is there water on the planet still?  They obviously obtain weapons ... can they not fight to gain any of the planet back as a free area?  Are there any resources left on the planet?  Why is there only one Elysium (space station)?  Why aren't there many?  What caused people to move to Elysium?  Why not have something similar on Earth?  The Earth in the movie didn't look like it had air pollution problems ... it looked dry, but that was one area of the planet and not explained.  Those people on Earth looked like they had food.  Where were they getting their food?  Why don't people fight the police?  Why don't more people put on the exoskeletons?  Why don't the people make their own Elysium?  Couldn't they steal the parts and technology if they had to?  Nothing was explained except to basically show the haves had a medical cure-all machine and would not share it with the have nots.  The haves lived on a beautiful space station and would not share it with the have nots.  Otherwise, we were shown nothing else.  Life is not that simplistic, one dimensional or non-diverse.  In addition, the characters were so superficial that I simply could not become invested in them.  I was not drawn in.  I was bored.  I was intellectually insulted.  I yearned for diversity.  But, I was not invested.The movie also seemed to demean even the Hispanic/Lantino people.  They were powerless to help themselves, so they needed a white savior to save them?  sigh.It was a horrible movie.",1,Oh How Far They've Sunk,1390003200,"01 18, 2014",2014,5578,"['get', 'main',

1554979,A1V74MGUYUUFAK,B008JFUN50,"Bob ""seabgb""","[4, 5]","District 9 was great, different; it took an actual political issue (apartheid) and twisted it into a compelling, allegorical scifi. Small budget, big effects, cool aliens, terrific acting. Lots of action. You would think the writer/director of District 9, given a chance at Hollywood resources, would blow you away. Well, he didn't. Instead, he gave us a propaganda film for the 99%. But I knew that going in and figured I'd still have a good time watching it. I didn't. I was bored. The movie is slow, action starved, and not very logical. Even the premise is a stretch -- the wealthy elite live in a ringworld-esque space station visible from Los Angeles with the naked eye. This space station would be the envy of anyone in the Star Trek or even Star Wars universes. And they have these Medical Bays that apparently can cure any sickness or disease. These bays look like tanning booths, and you can see the person in them while they're being worked on, which only takes a few seconds. These machines can even reconstruct a blown-apart face through a process we're given to assume is called re-atomization. Pretty impressive, huh? And it's all going to be available in 2154. Just 140 years from now. So that's the basis for the story: the uber rich, pretty people living in ringworld with their miracle health machine, and everyone else living in filth and poverty and sickness on the planet below. What happens is Matt Damon gets hit with a lethal dose of radiation, and his only salvation is to get into one of these machines. To do this, he must partner with, and do a favor for, a local gang leader geek warlord coyote type who seems to live above everyone else and who has a pretty good stock of high tech gadgets and weapons. The favor is that he needs to have Matt Damon download some programming from the head of Damon's old boss, a guy who owns and manages a robot factory where Damon used to work and where Damon got his lethal dose of radiation. This download is to be done after Damon surgically acquires some cyborg prosthetics. Two subplots complicate or compound this A-story. The first involves an old girlfriend of Damon's who (of course, can you say plot device?) has a sick child with Leukemia, and the second has to do with Jodi Foster's character plotting to overthrow the ringworld administrators. Btw, Jodi Foster speaks with the most bizarre accent in this movie. It's actually quite jarring.So, what's wrong with the picture? Let's count the ways. WARNING: Some Spoilers Follow1. Damon works in this factory. It looks like a cross between a UPS shipping facility and a junk yard. The only clean place in the whole factory is where the boss stands and looks at computer screens. So, why are they irradiating robot parts? I assume it's to decontaminate them. But then why would you decontaminate them and then roll them back onto the same factory floor they came from?2. The local warlord geek gang leader coyote has lots of resources. He has sophisticated weaponry, cyborg prostheses, lots of electronic stuff. He even has access to shuttles. Yeah, space shuttles. So why doesn't he have one of the Medical Bays? Wouldn't they be sort of a hot item on the black market?3. Why build an enormous space station in low earth orbit? Why not just buy Chile and live there? Why would a space station be safe? If you consider the direction space engineering is taking today, you see private enterprise and also smaller countries getting into the act. In 150 years, almost anyone will be able to shoot a rocket into space. A low Earth orbit space station visible with the naked eye from Los Angeles would be like hanging a water balloon on a tree limb at Camp BB Gun.4. If you need to shoot down unauthorized shuttles trying to enter your space station, why do it with some guy on the ground using a bunch of shoulder fired missiles? Why wouldn't a space station with a 1500 mile diameter have its own sophisticated defense system? You mean to tell me, the defense of a multi-gazillion dollar space habitat depends on a single guy who lives in a rathole and doesn't own a decent pair of clothes?5. This is a future world in which intelligent robots serve as cops and a process knows as re-atomization can fix any known human disease or injury, where a space station has been built that looks like a modern version of Rome. Re-atomization! Think about it. Scientists have figured out a way to create things at the atomic level. If you can re-atomize a human face and head in seconds, how long will it take to make a hot dog? And why are people starving and living in filth on the planet?This movie would make Gene Roddenberry roll over in his grave.Here's what I think happened: The director failed to assert himself when the talking heads in Hollywood took control of the story and said to him: ""Don't worry. It's a movie. We don't need to be logical.

1554986,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B008JFUN50,Brian Driver,"[7, 14]","ELYSIUM is a highly enjoyable movie, and could not be more timely. While it falls just a bit shy ofDistrict 9's brilliance, it still makes for a great movie experience.It is the year 2154, and Earth has been divided into two classes of humans: those who ""HAVE"" live on the cusp of space on a gorgeous circular space station known as Elysium. Those who ""HAVE NOT"" are packed into the overcrowded, miserable planet of Earth, where nothing works, living conditions are miserable, and the entire planet's population are not even called ""citizens."" Worse yet, medical care is miserable at best on Earth, but up on Elysium technology exists that cures any disease, instantly.It's no wonder everyone is trying to emigrate off the surface of the planet to get there. The only problem is that Elysium doesn't look kindly upon those who try to invade its borders, and those who attempt it often die in the process. Sure, the metaphor can be a little heavy handed at times, but if that doesn't worry you then this movie will be perfect for you.As far as special effects and cinematography, I loved DISTRICT 9, and I was similarly impressed with the ELYSIUM. The former film proved that director and writer Neill Blomkamp is amazing when it comes to working with seamless cinema technology, and this is a skill that is equally prominent in ELYSIUM - especially given his $100 million budget. The grainy, downtrodden worlds are extremely similar, but ELYSIUM goes one better with its depiction of the futuristic and beautiful space station - named after the mythical Hellenic afterlife realm where those who led heroic lives went to spend a careless afterlife. Blomkamp said he had to look no further than America's own Beverly Hills for his model of unapologetic boundless wealth.I also loved the actors: Matt Damon is terrific as always, playing the reluctant hero Max with anything BUT a heart of gold. Jodi Foster is also fine as Secretary of Defense Jessica Delacourt - I loved seeing her play against type as a heartless bureaucrat with an interesting accent to boot. Sharlto Copley - who played the sympathetic bumbling hero of DISTRICT 9 - tears up the screen here as Delacourt's deranged triggerman. Also of note was Brazilian actor Wagner Moura, playing a smuggler named Spider, an engaging role that allows him to be both opportunistic and ultimately humanistic.About the only fault I can find with the film is that ELYSIUM doesn't allow itself time to really get to the core of anything...there's little we feel we know about Damon's character other than the fact that he is perennially on the wrong side of the law. Similarly, we don't get to know anything about Secretary Delacourt - or her political counterpart President Patel - which would have been helpful, as they are continually at odds throughout the film, though we get little or no explanation why.What we DO get in its place is action...lots of it...especially in the second half of the film. This is enjoyable, but a little more fleshing out of the roles might have made for a little more satisfying film. DISTRICT 9 didn't have a lot of explanation behind it, either, but its spare storyline didn't need it. Here, the movie gets by on a similarly slight back story, but a little more would have helped.",4,"Action-Packed, Technologically Brilliant",1376524800,"08 15, 2013",2013,3266,"['ELYSIUM', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'timely', 'just', 'bit', 'shy', 'ofDistrict', '9', 'brilliance', 'still', 'great', 'movie', 'experience.It', 'year', '2154', 'Earth', 'been', 'divided', 'two', 'classes', 'humans', 'who', 'HAVE', 'live', 'cusp', 'space', 'gorgeous', 'circular', 'space', 'station', 'known', 'Elysium', 'who', 'HAVE', 'NOT', 'are', 'packed', 'overcrowded', 'miserable', 'planet', 'Earth', 'where', 'nothing', 'living', 'conditions', 'are', 'miserable', 'entire', 'planet', 'population', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'called', 'citizens', 'Worse', 'yet', 'medical', 'care', 'miserable', 'best', 'Earth', 'up', 'Elysium', 'technology', 'disease', 'instantly.It', 'wonder', 'everyone', 'trying', 'emigrate', 'off', 'surface', 'planet', 'get', 'there', 'only', 'problem', 'Elysium', ""n't"", 'look', 'kindly', 'who', 'try', 'invade', 'borders', 'who', 'attempt', 'often', 'process', 'Sure', 'metaphor', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'heavy', 'handed', 'times', ""n't"", 'worry', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'perfect', 'you.As', 'far', 'special', 'effects', 'cinematography', 'loved', 'DISTRICT', '9', 'was', 'similarly', 'impressed', 'ELYSIUM', 'former', 'film', 'proved', 'director', 'writer', 'Neill', 'Blomkamp', 'amazing', 'when', 'working', 'seamless', 'cinema', 'technology', 'skill', 'equally', 'prominent', 'ELYSIUM', 'especially', 'given', '100', 'million', 'budget', 'grainy', 'downtrodden', 'worlds', 'are', 'extremely', 'similar', 'ELYSIUM', 'one', 'better', 'depiction', 'futuristic', 'beautiful', 'space', 'station', 'named', 'mythical', 'Hellenic', 'afterlife', 'realm', 'where', 'who', 'led', 'heroic', 'lives', 'went', 'spend', 'careless', 'afterlife', 'Blomkamp', 'said', 'had', 'look', 'further', 'America', 'own', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'model', 'unapologetic', 'boundless', 'wealth.I', 'also', 'loved', 'actors', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'terrific', 'always', 'playing', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'Max', 'anything', 'BUT', 'heart', 'gold', 'Jodi', 'Foster', 'also', 'fine', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'Jessica', 'Delacourt', 'loved', 'seeing', 'play', 'type', 'heartless', 'bureaucrat', 'interesting', 'accent', 'boot', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'who', 'played', 'sympathetic', 'bumbling', 'hero', 'DISTRICT', '9', 'tears', 'screen', 'here', 'Delacourt', 'deranged', 'triggerman', 'Also', 'note', 'was', 'Brazilian', 'actor', 'Wagner', 'Moura', 'playing', 'smuggler', 'named', 'Spider', 'engaging', 'role', 'be', 'opportunistic', 'ultimately', 'humanistic.About', 'only', 'fault', 'can', 'find', 'film', 'ELYSIUM', ""n't"", 'allow', 'time', 'really', 'get', 'core', 'anything', 'little', 'feel', 'know', 'Damon', 'character', 'other', 'fact', 'perennially', 'wrong', 'side', 'law', 'Similarly', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'anything', 'Secretary', 'Delacourt', 'political', 'counterpart', 'President', 'Patel', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'helpful', 'are', 'continually', 'odds', 'film', 'get', 'little', 'explanation', 'DO', 'get', 'place', 'action', 'lots', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'more', 'fleshing', 'roles', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'little', 'more', 'satisfying', 'film', 'DISTRICT', '9', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'explanation', 'either', 'spare', 'storyline', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'Here', 'movie', 'similarly', 'slight', 'back', 'story', 'little', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'helped']",N/A

1555013,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B008JFUN50,Chris Kennison,"[3, 10]","""Elysium"" is a classic story being told in a not entirely new fashion. It's the classic story of power overwhelming the powerless; those with money and opportunity monopolizing that opportunity and leaving those without to squander through their existences. Much of ""Elysium"" rings true today and since this film is set 140-years from now, its realism and possibility aren't beyond belief. Earth's natural resources have dried up and so the haves, or the hugely wealthy, built a space station called ""Elysium"" and left the rest behind. Max DeCosta (Damon) is a typical blue-collar worker whos circumstances send him through a fast and faster escalating series of life changing events.Everything about ""Elysium"" is well done, all the way down to the casting of two children who look exactly like Damon's character and Frey (Alice Braga), Max's childhood friend. The story is constantly changing and engrossing. It was quite simply the fastest 109 minutes I have spent at the movies in a long time. Your heart is invested in the characters and the ruthlessness and power of the bad guys gives you a constant feeling of danger and overwhelming odds; just as a movie like this should.It isn't a deal breaker, but like ""Oblivion"" and many other movies that have come out in recent years or months, ""Elysium"" is a collage of many movies that have come before; ""Johnny Mneumonic"", ""Robo Cop"", ""In Time"" and ""Mad Max"", with a heavy emphasis on ""Johnny Mneumonic"". Despite this though, the movie has legitimacy about it and all of its elements are well thought out. This adds to the beauty of the film and it is beautiful. From the personalities that it explores to the plite, ""Elysium"" is a power film.Other than some overzealous shaky camera moments that I continue to hate in every movie I see them, ""Elysium"" is more satisfying than all of the superhero movies that came out his summer put together. I understand the art form that is shaky camera, but to have the camera shaking to the extent that you actually think about what the cameraman is doing to make it shake so much, it is bad. ""Elysium"", despite this, is the kind of movies that we all should be going to see. It's the kind of movie that Hollywood needs to be making more of because it sticks with you and doesn't leave you with the constant unsatisfied feeling you get from the superhero movies.",4,WARNING: This shaky ride may induce vomiting,1376870400,"08 19, 2013",2013,2352,"['Elysium', 'classic', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'not', 'entirely', 'new', 'fashion', 'classic', 'story', 'power', 'overwhelming', 'powerless', 'money', 'opportunity', 'monopolizing', 'opportunity', 'leaving', 'squander', 'existences', 'Much', 'Elysium', 'true', 'today', 'film', 'set', '140-years', 'now', 'realism', 'possibility', 'are', ""n't"", 'belief', 'Earth', 'natural', 'resources', 'have', 'dried', 'up', 'so', 'haves', 'hugely', 'wealthy', 'built', 'space', 'station', 'called', 'Elysium', 'left', 'rest', 'Max', 'DeCosta', 'Damon', 'typical', 'blue-collar', 'worker', 'whos', 'circumstances', 'send', 'fast', 'faster', 'escalating', 'series', 'life', 'changing', 'events.Everything', 'Elysium', 'well', 'done', 'way', 'casting', 'two', 'children', 'who', 'look', 'exactly', 'Damon', 'character', 'Frey', 'Alice', 'Braga', 'Max', 'childhood', 'friend', 'story', 'constantly', 'changing', 'engrossing', 'was', 'quite', 'simply', 'fastest', '109', 'minutes', 'have', 'spent', 'movies', 'long', 'time', 'heart', 'invested', 'characters', 'ruthlessness', 'power', 'bad', 'guys', 'constant', 'feeling', 'danger', 'overwhelming', 'odds', 'just', 'movie', 'should.It', ""n't"", 'deal', 'breaker', 'Oblivion', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'recent', 'years', 'months', 'Elysium', 'collage', 'many', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'Johnny', 'Mneumonic', 'Robo', 'Cop', 'Time', 'Mad', 'Max', 'heavy', 'emphasis', 'Johnny', 'Mneumonic', 'though', 'movie', 'legitimacy', 'elements', 'are', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'beauty', 'film', 'beautiful', 'personalities', 'plite', 'Elysium', 'power', 'film.Other', 'overzealous', 'shaky', 'camera', 'moments', 'continue', 'hate', 'movie', 'see', 'Elysium', 'more', 'satisfying', 'superhero', 'movies', 'came', 'out', 'summer', 'put', 'together', 'understand', 'art', 'form', 'shaky', 'camera', 'have', 'camera', 'shaking', 'extent', 'actually', 'think', 'what', 'cameraman', 'doing', 'make', 'shake', 'so', 'much', 'bad', 'Elysium', 'kind', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'going', 'see', 'kind', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'be', 'making', 'more', ""n't"", 'leave', 'constant', 'unsatisfied', 'feeling', 'get', 'superhero', 'movies']",N/A

It starts out with so much potential, with Matt Damon in the lead, --plus-- Jodie Foster, Sharlto Copley (District 9, The A-Team) and Alice Braga (I Am Legend, City Of God, Predators) in supporting roles. After an introduction of characters and a strong start, Elysium becomes predictable and at times down right boring.Matt Damon did what he could with his character, but he had little to work with. Elysium simply left me not caring about our hero, the pathetic masses on Earth, or this movie. Worse yet, I did not hate the bad guys in the least either. That dealt a one--two TKO blow to this movie for me.Once scene really did get my ire up, where we find that the world we know now, where the police, the judges and the probationary system we have in place in the US, is even more out of control, in this much less inhumane future, administrated by robots. I did find that interesting in a week of tech (mid December 2013) news dominated by Google's acquisition of Boston Dynamics, a robotics,  design and production company.If the screenwriters had played that angle up more, and pushed the buttons of the feelings of being cattle and sheep we endure every time a cop pulls us over to write us a traffic ticket today; This movie could have succeeded much more highly for me.The tech left me wanting in so many ways as well.

The ring world of Elysium reminds me of books by Larry Niven,, although this man made paradise is space was created for the super wealthy elite who leave the over populated and diseased planet Earth behind. The people left living on Earth dream of living on Elysium and steal shuttles to try to emigrate there, and like the Mexicans who face danger coming into this country (the Movie is filmed partly in Mexico and most of the actors speak Spanish with subtitles) don't always make it alive.The worst part of this movie was the story - which was about the magical beds they have on Elysium that cures everything without as much as a single cut or stich - followed by the acting. Damon plays his normal character, although he's more of a whiney, frightened, coward who makes bad choices consistently rather than a hero. Jody Foster - who in my opinion is one of the most highly overrated actors of all time - creates a bizarre character with an even more bizarre accent. I don't know what she's trying to do with this role, and I don't think she did either. I regret paying full price for this very poor film.

1555027,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B008JFUN50,C. Sawin,"[18, 29]","After Diego Luna's Julio tries to convince Matt Damon's Max to help him steal cars to no avail, Julio yells to Max, ""You used to be a legend!"" Words that sci-fi fans may be repeating towards director Neill Blomkamp after viewing his newest effort ""Elysium."" Neill Blomkamp made his directorial debut with the excellent sci-fi film ""District 9,"" which was also the feature film debut of South African actor Sharlto Copley. With excellent special effects, a surprisingly powerful story, and an absolutely heartbreaking ending, ""District 9"" brought faith back to the science fiction genre. ""Elysium"" is Blomkamp's second film which presumably has been in the works for the past four years, so there is a lot to live up to. Initially being quite pleased with ""Elysium,"" in retrospect it really doesn't come close to being as much of an absorbing experience as ""District 9.""There really isn't any arguing that ""Elysium"" visually looks very much like ""District 9."" Viewing the film as a standalone film rather than a follow-up to a superb debut feature is extremely difficult, but is a practice that should be executed more often. The characters seem very black and white as the more unfortunate individuals are very hard-working and caring while the better off tend to look down on everyone and only care about themselves. But if you take a closer look, then things are a little more unusual. While there are still several different cultures left on Earth, Matt Damon seems to be the only Caucasian person who hasn't made it to Elysium while it seems as though only Caucasian individuals reside on the space station.Jodie Foster portrays Delacourt; the senator of Elysium who takes command whenever a war-like situation develops. While the Elysium population is stereotypical rich folk, Delacourt seems to be the most pompous individual ever. Jodie Foster has this ridiculous accent that isn't even consistent or logical. There is literally no purpose behind it. Meanwhile John Carlyle (William Fichtner) is a resident from Elysium left to run the droid manufacturing warehouse Max works at who apparently knows how to develop some really destructive software. Delacourt hires him to basically help her turn Elysium upside down and leave her in charge. The issue is that Carlyle seems like a complete push over and if that software had been available this entire time, why didn't he try to do it himself? Why didn't anyone else think of it?Switching gears a bit and coming back to ""District 9,"" at least the weapons in ""District 9"" were creative and unique. The weapons in ""Elysium"" look intriguing and are usually quite flashy, but always have the same result which usually sees the human body erupting in a blood explosion of some kind. The exo-suits are fun as are the explosive rounds and a particular slow-motion sequence involving a droid, but it seems like you see the same weapon over and over again throughout the film. Although a certain facial reconstruction is handled extremely well.This may be coming off like a negative review, but it's actually constructive criticism more than anything. ""Elysium"" feels like 2013's ""Prometheus"" and while ""Elysium"" is the better film, it'll likely leave many disappointed since ""Elysium"" isn't the film that ""District 9"" was and still is. The droids are fantastic, the parole officer scene is amusing, and the contrast between Earth and Elysium is fascinating to ponder; Earth being portrayed as dirty and grungy while Elysium is very neat, clean, and prosperous. Kruger starts off as an interesting villainous character, but fizzles out near the end. He's an agent that gets released and wants his job back, but he's clearly just a drifter who's psychotic and likes to rape women. Why he's so hell bent on his career is kind of baffling. Did they have really good benefits? Did he not have a chance to get proper references? Certain concepts tickle the film fan in you like Matilda's (Emma Tremblay's) meerkat story, hijacking brain data, and Max and Frey's childhood being a returning story point. Everything leading up to Max's exo-suit surgery, the surgery itself at Spider's (Wagner Moura), and the John Carlyle ambush are arguably the high points of the film.""Elysium"" has some really cool concepts that include shades of ""Terminator 2,"" ""Aliens,"" and the more obvious choice of ""District 9,"" but the disappointing aspect is that it just doesn't live up to ""District 9."" Despite ""Elysium"" trying to have a strong message, it doesn't impact your emotions the same way ""District 9"" did. The film leaves you torn about its performances, about its ending, and just about everything regarding the film in general. ""Elysium"" is extremely genuine at heart, but its story structure is so futuristically torqued that nothing seems to affect you the way that it should.",4,What's in it for the hippo?,1376006400,"08

The didactic aspect of the film is so heavy-handed it takes you right out of the movie, out of the willing suspension of disbelief. It doesn't help that ""Elysium"" lacks the arresting characters, clever plotting, or wowee special effects that break science fiction films out beyond the genre's diehard fans.It's 2154 in a dystopic Los Angeles. LA is ugly and garbage-strewn, in a futuristic way. Almost everyone in LA is Hispanic or at least speaks Spanish. Max (Matt Damon), a bald and tattooed ex-con trying to go straight, is forced into taking on a high-risk crime for Spider (Wagner Moura), a crime lord. Max has to travel to Elysium, a space station where rich white Americans live in beauty and luxury, unlike the cursed denizens of earth, who are mostly Hispanic and live in garbage strewn slums and can't get adequate medical care. Elysium has med-beds. If you lie down on a med-bed, no matter what your ailment is, the med-bed will cure you.Spider is plotting to breach Elysium's security and take it over, thus making med-beds and Elysium's breathtaking beauty available to all. He faces formidable foes.Jodie Foster is the white, blonde Elysium antagonist. She is trying to protect Elysium from the Hispanic immigrants and sick people in search of health care who are attempting to enter. Kruger, played by Sharlto Copley, a South African actor, is her evil tool. There is no attempt to explain why someone with such a pronounced South African accent lives in LA. In any case, Copley's performance of an enthusiastic sadist is the best thing about the film.There is a lot of chasing. Men put on metallic costumes that give them special powers. There are your usual hyped up guns and there are also some knives and swords. A lot of this feels like expedient cheating, as it always does in fantasy movies. There are special devices that detect runaways. Max is able to elude these super smart devices by hiding under pigs. The movie never explains, as these movies never explain, the rules of such gadgetry. If a character needs to get away to advance the plot, some trick will help him to get away.I live in a non-futuristic, garbage-strewn slum. We have had liberal, Democratic government for generations. See Detroit. We've been hearing the same message for generations, the same message ""Elysium"" sends: ""It's us versus them. We are human; they are cold and cruel. They live lives of perfect bliss. Their health problems are all taken care of. They only way for us to achieve anything is to take what they have.""This message, even in a grade C sci-fi flick, is toxic. Liberals do not help us, the poor, by telling us that we have nothing of value in ourselves, that it is only through taking what the rich have that we can have lives of value. Poor people do not benefit by discounting what they have and living lives of passive, deluded envy, focusing on what the rich have rather than focusing on their own skills and blessings, and cultivating their own opportunities.If the Earthlings of ""Elysium"" succeeded in their goal, it wouldn't end there. It would end as the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, the Iranian Revolution and others ended: with terror, torture, rape, chaos, and ""meet the new boss; same as the old boss.""

As despicable a person as Matt Damon is, or to be more precise, as ignorant a person as Mr. Damon may be, he has been in some very superb movies. The first Bourne movie was excellent and the following two he was featured in were very good as well, especially the third. It was proven in the fourth outing that didn't feature Mr. Damon that others could play the role as well as the fourth outing starring an, in my opinion, a more skilled actor or at least one on par with Mr. Damon, that any decent and halfway fit person could play Bourne though I have to admit that of all the Bourne movies the first one was by far the best (and sold a lot of those crappy little currently BMW midget cars, the Mini Cooper.Elysium is a high action content movie that has nothing to do with Bourne of course and I completely enjoyed it. It wont win any awards other than perhaps cash for its lead actor but it was entertaining as hell. So forget the ignorant and misguided politics of Matt Damon, time will prove that to be wrong as it already is and just enjoy the work he does. It is rare that Matt Damon picks a poor script and I have to admit he had provided me with a great deal of entertainment. It is just a shame that he tries to use his fame to attempt to further incredibly stupid politics. But would you listen to the political beliefs of a housepainter? No. So why would you listen to those of a possibly less skilled person, a mere Hollywood actor?",4,Not great but I enjoyed it.

As with his first feature-length showing, Blomkamp's vision and attention to detail are instant hooks, but the director carelessly chooses to cut bait before reeling in his big catch. This film's knack for the little things is easily its most striking feature: the robust, believable appearance of the world's widespread future tech, a melting pot of different languages amongst the commoners, a photographer's eye when fitting the upper class's orbiting space station into shots of the horizon.Those intricacies at play, plus the dead-simple premise, make the first hour a real joy to behold. It's when the plot tries to get up and go in the second act, sadly, that it falls apart at the seams. There's just nothing to it; an immodest collection of bad action movie gimmicks and one-dimensional characters, it seems to lose track of the core message at twenty paces. It's constantly contradictive and routinely under-explains key concepts, not for added dramatic tension, but because nobody seems to have thought that far ahead. The frequent fight scenes are a handheld buffet, herking and jerking the screen right to the point of nausea and beyond. The list goes on. At the end of the day, even poor Matt Damon's redemptive character arc, a simple affair in which a selfish man finally makes a sacrifice to the betterment of his peers, is rendered pointless by a glaring, significant series of plot holes.As a showcase of imagination, this is great stuff.

First off, if Elysium can send medical transports to heal Earth's inhabitants, why does it take a catastrophic event to achieve it? They could have made it more realistic by saying that even though Elysium has the resources to heal the sick, they are extorting them, somehow, for their own profit. But, as the last scene shows, that isn't the case, since they do have the resources. So the question posed is, &#34;Why not heal the Earth people?&#34; I mean there is no motive to not.And then we have the underlying theme of &#34;Everyone has something special to do in life.&#34; Really? Tell that to the factory worker with 30 years on an assembly-line. That's more of a religious conviction to sooth the masses who live mundane and boring lives, to sooth them and to motivate them to get up one more time and put in one more mundane day of work.And then we have a fairly shallow character development. I never felt close to any of the characters. More importantly, in a movie of this sort, I never felt much contempt for the bad guys. A computer programed with formulaic algorithms could have written the screen play. From a human point of view, it's lazy writing and devoid of innovation or plot twists.The saving grace of this movie, for sci-fi fans, is that they spared no quarter for tech and FX. Everything looked believable and real. The tech conformed to known physical laws and there wasn't ever a point at which I said, &#34;Oh right, completely idiotic.&#34; True there is a problem with rotating platforms and gravity, but we're getting closer and closer, even today, at figuring out a way to create artificially gravity, so no problem.So, there you have it. The plot is as simplistic as this: Bad guy super advanced civilization exploits the masses for its own pleasures. Super-hero saves the day. This receives a big and fat yawn, and 2.5 stars. I gave it the benefit of great technology that conforms to physical laws.If you're bored one night and need some sci-fi tech, this will work nicely.

Anyone who doubts this has only to read Heinlein, Bradbury, Asimov, Philip K. Dick, Herbert and many others. Watch Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report, The Adjustment Bureau, Star Wars etc., etc. It's always the apparently powerless fighting long odds against an oppressive or much greater force either for their own good or for the good of a class of people. It will always be political, particularly the bigger epics. If you side with the more powerful, you'll hate the upstarts, but most people fall into the 99% and cheer for the little guy. I know I do. It's simplistic to tag this or most films with a political/economic label. My heart (and that of most audiences) is going to be with whoever has to fight for his life against those who want to keep all the good for themselves. Elysium does this well like the best scifi. You root for Damon's character. What elevates Elysium is the acting of both Matt Damon and Sharlto Copley, in particular. And I'm always going to love Jodie Foster no matter what she does.I love a good action flick that tells a story I can get involved in,particularly one that pays such close attention to artistic detail. My only criticism is that it wasn't shot in 3-D. Damon says it should not have been and so was shot in 2-D. I respectfully disagree. The story is solid, the action lends itself to immersion, and the views of Elysium itself and the ruined Earth should have been in depth, the way it would be in real life.But I won't quarrel with the director's choice. The story, the action, the speculation, the science are all grounded in ""could be possible"" and make me shiver. The actors are exceptional. Our movie money was well spent.

1555090,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B008JFUN50,Enjolras,"[4, 8]","Director Neill Blomkamp made gained international fame with the underground hit District 9, which combined special effects and strong acting with a nuanced social commentary about interracial relations in Blomkamp's native South Africa. Elysium continues many of the same themes but also suggests that Blomkamp might be adopting the worst tendencies of Hollywood.As a standalone science fiction movie, Elysium is pretty decent. It's a fast sci-fi thriller about a man (Matt Damon) who seeks a better life on an orbiting station called Elysium. Earth has fallen into dire straights while the wealthy seek refuge in Elysium. There are some pretty bold plot twists and the movie manages to be an entertaining ride. However, the movie promised to be more than just another sci-fi action movie. Unfortunately, it proves to be less compelling as social commentary.The movie nearly hits you over the head with the immigration theme. This movie is about immigration and Neill Blomkamp wants you to know it. Blomkamp even went so far as to cast Hispanics for most of the characters stuck on Earth (with the notable exception of Matt Damon). The residents of Elysium are all white and have American accents. As an analogy for U.S. immigration politics, this is about as subtle as a Rush Limbaugh.However, effective social commentary needs more than just an analogy. The story should help viewers understand the issue better or from a new perspective. Again, the lack of subtlety undermines the commentary. The managers of Elysium are portrayed as villains of the worst sort. Jodie Foster is an unsympathetic dictator and Sharlto Copley is a sadistic bounty hunter who likes killing immigrants. The residents of Elysium are portrayed merely as wealthy and out-of-touch. The immigrants we see simply want access to better medical care for them or their adorable children. As such, the movie seems to insist that keeping illegal immigrants out is morally inexcusable.Yet, for all of its analogies to real-world immigration politics, the movie's depiction of immigration says nothing about real-world immigration politics. The movie never explores the real driver behind immigration politics, namely competition between low-wage American workers and immigrant workers. If anything, the wealthy in America and corporations are more likely to favor immigration as a source of cheap labor. There are also important questions about the capacity of government institutions and resources to handle a large influx of immigrants.Elysium chooses simplistic answers rather than exploring these tensions. The movie's finale borders on ridiculous. *SPOILER* The Earth residents manage to make all humans citizens of Elysium and thereby grant them all access to Elysium's healthcare system. However, in practice this would probably quickly overburden the health system, leading to a deterioration in quality or a complete collapse. *SPOILER*The contrast to District 9 is illuminating. In that movie, there were no black and white heroes and villains. The government's policies were portrayed as wrong, but not evil. Sharlto Copley's character in District 9, Wikus, the government inspector, started off as a hapless bureaucrat, not a sadistic monster (a sharp contrast to Copley's character in Elysium). More importantly, District 9 shows Wikus gradually learning about the aliens and gaining respect for them. The movie invited viewers to take the same journey as Wikus and showed us why the government policies were wrong. By contrast, I felt that too often Elysium simply tried to force its arguments on viewers.I've probably been too harsh on Elysium but only because Neill Blomkamp raised the bar so high. Again, as an action/adventure sci-fi movie it holds up pretty well. I focused on the social commentary aspects of the film because it permeates so much of Elysium. My review is not intended to argue a particular side of the immigration debate, but rather to show just how unsatisfactory Elysium is as social commentary. One gets the sense that Blomkamp dumbed down the social commentary and adopted more traditional Hollywood approaches to moviemaking, including increasing the action, hiring famous actors, and dumbing down the social commentary. It's worth watching, but with lowered expectations.Overall: 3.5 stars.",3,more action film than social commentary,1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,4302,"['Director', 'Neill', 'Blomkamp', 'made', 'gained', 'international', 'fame', 'underground', 'hit', 'District', '9', 'combined', 'special', 'effects', 'strong', 'acting', 'nuanced', 'social', 'commentary', 'interracial', 'relations', 'Blomkamp', 'native', 'South', 'Africa', 'Elysium', 'many', 'same', 'themes', 'also', 'Blomkamp', 'might', 'be', 'adopting', 'worst', 'tendencies', 'Hollywood.As', 'standalone', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'Elysium', 'pretty', 'decent', 'fast', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'man', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'who', 'better', 'life', 'orbiting', 'station', 'called', 'Elysium', 'Earth', 'fallen', 'dire', 'straights', 'wealthy', 'seek', 'refuge', 'Elysium', 'are', 'pretty', 'bold', 'plot', 'twists', 'movie', 'be', 'entertaining', 'ride', 'However', 'movie', 'promised', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'be', 'less', 'compelling', 'social', 'commentary.The', 'movie', 'nearly', 'head', 'immigration', 'theme', 'movie', 'immigration', 'Neill', 'Blomkamp', 'know', 'Blomkamp', 'even', 'went', 'so', 'far', 'cast', 'Hispanics', 'most', 'characters', 'stuck', 'Earth', 'notable', 'exception', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'residents', 'Elysium', 'are', 'white', 'have', 'American', 'accents', 'analogy', 'U.S.', 'immigration', 'politics', 'about', 'as', 'subtle', 'Rush', 'Limbaugh.However', 'effective', 'social', 'commentary', 'needs', 'more', 'just', 'analogy', 'story', 'should', 'help', 'viewers', 'understand', 'issue', 'better', 'new', 'perspective', 'Again', 'lack', 'subtlety', 'undermines', 'commentary', 'managers', 'Elysium', 'are', 'portrayed', 'villains', 'worst', 'sort', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'unsympathetic', 'dictator', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'sadistic', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'who', 'killing', 'immigrants', 'residents', 'Elysium', 'are', 'portrayed', 'merely', 'wealthy', 'out-of-touch', 'immigrants', 'see', 'simply', 'want', 'access', 'better', 'medical', 'care', 'adorable', 'children', 'such', 'movie', 'insist', 'keeping', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'out', 'morally', 'inexcusable.Yet', 'analogies', 'real-world', 'immigration', 'politics', 'movie', 'depiction', 'immigration', 'nothing', 'real-world', 'immigration', 'politics', 'movie', 'never', 'real', 'driver', 'immigration', 'politics', 'namely', 'competition', 'low-wage', 'American', 'workers', 'immigrant', 'workers', 'anything', 'wealthy', 'America', 'corporations', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'favor', 'immigration', 'source', 'cheap', 'labor', 'are', 'also', 'important', 'questions', 'capacity', 'government', 'institutions', 'resources', 'handle', 'large', 'influx', 'immigrants.Elysium', 'chooses', 'simplistic', 'answers', 'rather', 'exploring', 'tensions', 'movie', 'finale', 'borders', 'ridiculous', '*SPOILER*', 'Earth', 'residents', 'manage', 'make', 'humans', 'citizens', 'Elysium', 'thereby', 'grant', 'access', 'Elysium', 'healthcare', 'system', 'However', 'practice', 'would', 'probably', 'quickly', 'overburden', 'health', 'system', 'leading', 'deterioration', 'quality', 'complete', 'collapse', '*SPOILER*The', 'contrast', 'District', '9', 'illuminating', 'movie', 'were', 'black', 'white', 'heroes', 'villains', 'government', 'policies', 'were', 'portrayed', 'wrong', 'not', 'evil', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'character', 'District', '9', 'Wikus', 'government', 'inspector', 'started', 'off', 'hapless', 'bureaucrat', 'not', 'sadistic', 'monster', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'Copley', 'character', 'Elysium', 'More', 'importantly', 'District', '9', 'shows', 'Wikus', 'gradually', 'learning', 'aliens', 'gaining', 'respect', 'movie', 'invited', 'viewers', 'take', 'same', 'journey', 'Wikus', 'showed', 'why', 'government', 'policies', 'were', 'wrong', 'contrast', 'felt', 'too', 'often', 'Elysium', 'simply', 'tried', 'force', 'arguments', 'viewers.I', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'been', 'too', 'harsh', 'Elysium', 'only', 'Neill', 'Blomkamp', 'raised', 'bar', 'so', 'high', 'Again', 'action/adventure', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'focused', 'social', 'commentary', 'aspects', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'Elysium', 'review', 'not', 'intended', 'argue', 'particular', 'side', 'immigration', 'debate', 'rather', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'unsatisfactory', 'Elysium', 'social', 'commentary', 'One', 'sense', 'Blomkamp', 'dumbed', 'social', 'commentary', 'adopted', 'more', 'traditional', 'Hollywood', 'approaches', 'moviemaking', 'including', 'increasing', 'action', 'hiring', 'famous', 'actors', 'dumbing', 'down', 'social', 'commentary', 'worth', 'watching', 'lowered', 'expectations.Overall', '3.5', 'stars']",N/A

More alarming and lesser known fact is that the number of billionaires has increased in the first decade of the 21st century at an unprecedented rate. Elysium cunningly mirrors what current trends may lead to in a grim and merciless yet plausible future. Throughout the film one realizes we are already living in that future.Elysium is simply a heaven and a haven for billionaires. Set in space, in proximity to earth, it is a state of the art space station that inhabits only the richest of the rich in five stars living conditions, whereas the rest of humanity lives on earth, poorer and more miserable than ever.The film deals with the dreams and efforts of the poor to reach Elysium to get better life and access magical medical treatment device that can cure all diseases and prolong life expectancy.Our protagonist, Max (Matt Damon), has always wanted to reach Elysium. Unfortunately as an adult he has to get there to save his own life, after absorbing a lethal dosage of radiation in an exploitative sweatshop-like factory owned and managed by one the above mentioned billionaires. The price of obtaining a ticket up is engaging in a highly violent and deadly mission to capture and deliver information that same billionaire possesses.

Turns out, I could have.Here's the scoop. 2154's Earth has pretty much been turned into an ashtray, and all the the elite have moved to Elysium, an orbiting space station. Max (Matt Damon) is a parolee working a crap job in a factory. Lax safety regulations cause him to take a massive dose of radiation. He has five days to worm his way to Elysium to get cured. The job he pulls to do so puts data directly into his brain pan that is meant to stage a coup on their president by Delacourt (Jodie Foster) the secretary. It's all out mayhem.There is so much to love here. The earth scenes are much like what viewers saw in ""District 9"" with the dust, heat, grit and poverty. These opening scenes are great in depicting the situation. Damon delivers some great dialogue like he was born for it. The factory scenes are easily as good. You feel as though you are there with him. Then things get dicey. Some of the plot points are just plain stupid, inconsistent and unbelievable. Not to spoil but how is it the first rogue ships are set upon immediately when entering Elysium while Spider's ship lands unmolested, even when the heat has been turned up to eleven? I could go on but why bother. Just let it be said that some things happen that will leave you shaking your head.I'm not throwing the baby out with the bathwater. This is well worth seeing, just don't expect a better effort than was ""District 9."" I root for Blomkamp. I think he's a heck of a director. He just isn't a great writer.

Alas, it was not to be.  Very soon, the film turns deadly serious, deadly dumb, deadly dull, and, well... just plain deadly.In this installment of the classic struggle between Haves and Have-Nots, the Haves are Rich Evil White People, who run and continue to wreck the Earth from their paradise space station, Elysium,  the 22nd century version of the gated suburban community.  Meanwhile, the Have-Nots are poor but caring people of color, mostly Hispanic, who seem to want nothing more than to care for their children, many of whom seem to be falling ill.Somehow, Matt Damon finds himself in this mix as the would-be hero of the Have-Nots.  Why?  Because Matt Damon is a top box office action star, and there be action coming!  Still, Matt Damon isn't quite bad-ass enough, so they shave his head and rough him up a little so he looks like a mini Bruce Willis.  Let the action commence!What the Have-Nots seem to covet most about Elysium is the access to free and perfect health care.  Every McMansion in the rich white suburban world has a medical device in the living room that can miraculously cure any ailment, in seconds.  Childhood Leukemia?  No problemo.  Lie down in this MRI-looking device and whoosh! The 1970's style digital readout now flashes, ""Cancer cells 100% cleared!""  My microwave doesn't even work that fast.Is this sounding political enough yet?  Wait, there's more!  The poor but caring people of color try desperately to get to Elysium to save their ailing children, but alas, the Rich Evil White People have a Department of Homeland Security (run by Jodie Foster playing the Michele Bachman-type-conservative-bitch character) that ruthlessly cracks down on such ""illegal immigration"" by shooting their ships out of the sky.  And, in a subtle nod to the Truther movement, they use a rogue CIA-type spy to act as a terrorist and shoot down the planes of the people of Earth.The plot gets really convoluted when Matt Damon's character, Max, gets exposed to radiation after an Evil White Person forces him to do something dangerous on the job.  Damon is given 5 days to live, but the health care on Elysium could save  him.  So a plot is hatched with the people of color to kidnap an Important Evil White Person and download his brain which has some software code that will control everything on Elysium.  Will Damon and his Hispanic cohorts make it to Elysium to save himself and the people of Planet Earth?  Who cares.The storyline and characters are so silly and paranoid and one-dimensional that all that's left to care about are the action sequences and special effects.  It becomes like watching a bad video game.  The fighting scenes are interminable and so over the top that they border on self-parody.  You would think that by the 22nd century the technology of violence would have advanced to the point where it would be quick, quiet and efficient, like a zap from a ray-gun.  But that would be no fun to watch, so here the weapons are bigger, louder and inflict more gory damage.  Fortunately, there are  high tech gizmos to fix you up, so the fighting can continue another round.  In one scene, Damon, whose huge machine guns and bazookas have been unsuccessful in killing the main bad guy, explodes a grenade in his face.  All that is left is some bloody bones.  But wait!  His comrades run him through the trusty Facial Reconstruction Machine, and faster than you can say, ""Yeah, right, what a crock"", voila! He is as good as new, and ready for the next action scene.This is what happens when you give a film-maker a bad script and too much money.  For much better movies on a similar theme, check out Planet of the Apes, Soylent Green, and Blade Runner.  Someday Matt Damon will be embarrassed that he was in this movie.

1555106,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B008JFUN50,FNDNreview,"[10, 18]","In 2009, director Neill Blomkamp made his feature debut with the sci-fi drama, District 9 - about the segregation of aliens in a South American internment camp, called District 9.  This film was shot on a relatively conservative budget of $30 million and went on to gross more than $200 million worldwide.  Not only did the film perform well at the box office, but it was also highly praised by fans and critics, and even went on to earn four Academy Award nominations - including a nomination for Best Picture.  The overwhelming success of District 9 has obviously set an elevated bar for Neill Blomkamp and his next film.  In his second endeavor, Blomkamp once again returns to the world of sci-fi, re-teaming with his former District 9 star, Sharlto Copley, and adding Matt Damon in the politically and sociologically driven film, Elysium.Written and directed by Neill Blomkamp (District 9), Elysium stars Matt Damon as Max, a former car thief turned factory worker.  After an accident at work, Max is exposed to a high dose of radiation, giving him only five days left to live.  He turns to a powerful underground associate, called Spider (Wagner Moura), to help him get to the off-earth space station, Elysium.  The home to the richest members of earth's desolate society, Elysium also houses the technology to heal the sick and dying.  However, before Spider will send Max to Elysium, he must first kidnap a wealthy member of society and extract vital, profitable information.  Unfortunately, things don't always work out as planned for Max.  Jodie Foster, Alice Braga, William Fichtner, and Sharlto Copley also star in supporting roles.With so many different incarnations of sci-fi and desolate futures, it can be taxing to stay original.  The story of Elysium is certainly an interesting story, full of innuendos about wealth vs. poverty, but more importantly - the film doesn't feel like other sci-fi films.  Sure, it throws in elements of Total Recall, Gattaca, and even Terminator, but Elysium doesn't feel like a knock-off, rip-off flick that a studio or filmmaker made just for the sake of making a movie.  However, as soon as Matt Damon dawns this exoskeleton suit, it's hard not to think about Robocop - or even a variation of Darth Vader.  The weaponry, which fire like normal weapons, suddenly morph into devastatingly catastrophic weapons.  Shades of Judge Dredd, perhaps?  And, what's with Sharlto Copley's character having some random impenetrable shielding device?  For a film that feels like a down-to-earth sci-fi story, it doesn't take long for it to incorporate elements that severely feel out of place.Matt Damon is one of the most talented actors in Hollywood, so it shouldn't be a surprise to hear that he brings his A-game to Elysium.  While he did train intensively for this role - not to mention shave his head, his character can be a bit clunky at times.  There's little doubt that his character, Max, is meant to do something special with his life, but at the same time, Max is a desperate and tragic character.  He realizes early on in the film that he wants to live, although he never really shows what it is he wants to live for - other than himself.  He connects briefly with his childhood friend, Fray (Alice Braga), but feels little remorse for her daughter's detrimental health.  And, it is pretty outlandish that he takes such physical punishment without consequence over the course of the film - having his arm broke, being stabbed, going through major constructive surgery, and receiving a full dose of radiation.  It is pretty astonishing that this character can go from the fetal position one minute to someone that's stronger than everyone else the next.  Still, Damon looks pretty awesome with his Hitman-look and tailor made suit, so much so that he (at times) completely overshadows the film, which really isn't what Neill Blomkamp was hoping for with this flick.Visually speaking, Elysium looks very similar to District 9, making it extremely plausible that both films could take place in the same film universe.  Both films take place in rundown, destitute societies - with the main difference being one is an alien quarantine, while in Elysium, the story's main city of Los Angeles is filled with poor, sick people that are struggling for survival.  It's essentially the same premise, only each film takes place on the other side of the planet.  Aside from the locations, the film relies on CGI, but not enough to make it look abusive or unnecessary.  Anytime off world interaction takes place, odds are CGI will come into play, and although the CGI isn't the best, the concept of the Elysium station and the spaceships are still visually engaging enough to sell the story as a serious sci-fi drama.  On a side note, it's actually nice to see some space travel that doesn't involve massive Star Trek-looking spaceships, filled with warm speed and unavoidable alien encounters.Overall, Elysium is a solid story, but it's not on par with District 9.  Matt Damon is a relatively major draw in the film industry, so he might be enough to put butts in seats.  However, the film is far from an enjoyable thrill ride, featuring strange characters (mostly the villains), and flawed messages of political corruption and the implication that rich people are evil.  Despite its flaws, Elysium is still an enjoyable film, all-be-it clich&eacute;d and troublesome at times with its character development.  Sadly, Jodie Foster presence in the film is hardly worth mentioning and her skillset is basically wasted, only sharing one brief scene with Damon.  In any event, Matt Damon offsets the obvious flaws, making this film a recommendable feature - only if you're into cataclysmic future action stories, though (and who isn't?).  There's very little doubt that this film definitely caters to those of us that have an acquired taste for sci-fi chaos.GRADE:  CFNDNreview.com",3,"Damon stellar in the average sci-fi flick,

1555122,A1YTR8FI6UPMA6,B008JFUN50,Get Serious,"[1, 8]","(Spoilers)As many have alluded to...you can't really review Elysium without first talking about District 9, as the producers have based this film on the same premise. D9 has to do with an alien race 'getting stuck' here on Earth and unable to return to their home planet. The human population then imprisons them behind a fence within a ghetto to keep them out of the way and prevent them from mixing with humans. Obviously this is an analogy to the Africaan government overseeing South African blacks (who worked the diamond mines for the Dutch Africaans.) i.e. apartied. The film moves ahead in having one of the Africaans becoming infected with alien DNA and thus transitioning into an alien. This of course allowed us to see the xenophbia and racism for one of their own, because he had now changed. Emphasis in these films is on Third World ghettos and militaristic police states maintaining order by force, i.e. the poor (or unfortunate) vs. the rich overseers; i.e. rich vs. poor. The producers concentrate upon the overt fear that well-to-do stratas of society have for the unfortunate, different races or in this case aliens; i.e. xenophbia. They put the Third World in your face for shock value to at least unsettle you. Myself, I have traveled extensively in the Third World and define it primarily as a society that does not have pure water...everything follows after this.ELYSIUM...the premise is somewhat similar. The poor and miserable live upon a polluted and disgusting planet Earth, while the rich (who can afford it) live in the pure and beautiful space station in the sky.  They also maintain the incredible advanced technology of the ability to cure any medical problem. Everyone wants to go to Elysium, the space station to get cured. I won't go into the rest of it and the shoot-em'-up action sequences. But the screenplay expresses many overt realizations. The greatest real fear today on the planet is overpopulation, leading to inability to feed, house and care for the inhabitants. This leads to crime and a gangland ambience. The big corporations still utilize humans as slave labor to create items that enhance the lives of the fortunate. One premise which suggests future realism is the taking over of all mundane jobs by robots, who assume life and death control over the masses. The United States has been under the control of the N*w W*rld Ord*r since the end of WWII and it is common knowledge that we live in an occupied p*lice st*te. Companies working toward advanced self-contained robotics (Japan and others) seek to create a policing force which will control the masses by force. As portrayed in the film this will certainly be their first use! Advanced electronics and electronic warfare are illustrated and this gives us a look at a probable future (much of it already realized!). The film doesn't really address HOW humans are going to clean up their planet or their screwed-up society. So it leaves us hanging. The film is bloody and violent and probably not for women and certainly not for kids. This production team seems committed to pushing this premise into our faces. I'm not sure they are really accomplishing anything except for raising the level of overall dread in the population.",3,Not what I had initially pictured.,1376438400,"08 14, 2013",2013,3233,"['Spoilers', 'many', 'have', 'alluded', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'review', 'Elysium', 'first', 'talking', 'District', '9', 'producers', 'have', 'based', 'film', 'same', 'premise', 'D9', 'do', 'alien', 'race', ""'getting"", 'stuck', 'here', 'Earth', 'unable', 'return', 'home', 'planet', 'human', 'population', 'then', 'fence', 'ghetto', 'keep', 'way', 'prevent', 'mixing', 'humans', 'Obviously', 'analogy', 'Africaan', 'government', 'overseeing', 'South', 'African', 'blacks', 'who', 'worked', 'diamond', 'mines', 'Dutch', 'Africaans', 'i.e', 'apartied', 'film', 'moves', 'ahead', 'having', 'one', 'Africaans', 'becoming', 'infected', 'alien', 'DNA', 'thus', 'transitioning', 'alien', 'course', 'allowed', 'see', 'xenophbia', 'racism', 'one', 'own', 'had', 'now', 'changed', 'Emphasis', 'films', 'Third', 'World', 'ghettos', 'militaristic', 'police', 'states', 'maintaining', 'order', 'force', 'i.e', 'poor', 'unfortunate', 'rich', 'overseers', 'i.e', 'rich', 'vs.', 'poor', 'producers', 'concentrate', 'overt', 'fear', 'well-to-do', 'stratas', 'society', 'have', 'unfortunate', 'different', 'races', 'case', 'i.e', 'xenophbia', 'put', 'Third', 'World', 'face', 'shock', 'value', 'least', 'unsettle', 'have', 'traveled', 'extensively', 'Third', 'World', 'define', 'primarily', 'society', 'not', 'have', 'pure', 'water', 'everything', 'this.ELYSIUM', 'premise', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'poor', 'miserable', 'live', 'polluted', 'disgusting', 'planet', 'Earth', 'rich', 'who', 'can', 'afford', 'live', 'pure', 'beautiful', 'space', 'station', 'sky', 'also', 'maintain', 'incredible', 'advanced', 'technology', 'ability', 'cure', 'medical', 'problem', 'Everyone', 'go', 'Elysium', 'space', 'station', 'get', 'cured', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'rest', ""shoot-em'-up"", 'action', 'sequences', 'screenplay', 'many', 'overt', 'realizations', 'greatest', 'real', 'fear', 'today', 'planet', 'overpopulation', 'leading', 'inability', 'feed', 'house', 'care', 'inhabitants', 'crime', 'gangland', 'ambience', 'big', 'corporations', 'still', 'utilize', 'humans', 'slave', 'labor', 'create', 'items', 'enhance', 'lives', 'fortunate', 'One', 'premise', 'future', 'realism', 'taking', 'mundane', 'jobs', 'robots', 'who', 'assume', 'life', 'death', 'control', 'masses', 'United', 'States', 'been', 'control', 'N*w', 'W*rld', 'Ord*r', 'end', 'WWII', 'common', 'knowledge', 'live', 'occupied', 'p*lice', 'st*te', 'Companies', 'working', 'advanced', 'self-contained', 'robotics', 'Japan', 'others', 'seek', 'create', 'policing', 'force', 'will', 'control', 'masses', 'force', 'portrayed', 'film', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'first', 'use', 'Advanced', 'electronics', 'electronic', 'warfare', 'are', 'illustrated', 'look', 'probable', 'future', 'much', 'already', 'realized', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'address', 'HOW', 'humans', 'are', 'going', 'clean', 'up', 'planet', 'screwed-up', 'society', 'hanging', 'film', 'bloody', 'violent', 'probably', 'not', 'women', 'certainly', 'not', 'kids', 'production', 'team', 'committed', 'pushing', 'premise', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'are', 'really', 'accomplishing', 'anything', 'raising', 'level', 'overall', 'dread', 'population']",N/A

Elysium is beautiful a paradise complete with mansions, pools, palm trees, andeach home has its own ""Med Bed"" where any ""citizen"" of Elysium can become instantlycured of anything that ails him/her, up to and including having your head blown off bysome random ordnance.Earth is in ruins, but still ruled by a surveillance state Reich where jobs are few and expectationsare high. Matt Damon is terrific in the role of a regular guy with a vague criminal past thatis imprinted somewhere on his person, so that all the watchers have to do is just scan himfrom their remote hovercraft, and voo-ah-lah, his entire history pops up for everyone to see.He also works in the factory where these killer robots are manufactured, and after reportingto work late and getting reamed by his boss, is forced to compromise his body in order tokeep the line running. The next thing you know he's told he has 5 days to live, is given somepills and a pat on the butt and advised to get lost.As with all these apocalyptic films, there is an opposition force with a leader who is of coursea computer genius, and they have the ability to replicate the ""citizen"" credentials on anyone,which essentially is a tattoo burned into the arm. Matt wants one so he can travel to Elysiumto get some time on one of those Med Beds, and of course he has to make a deal with therebel leader in exchange for his passport. So now we see our hero being suited up with ahybrid mechanical suit to counter his weakening physical state, and a computer is screwedinto the back of his head complete with a connector installed behind his ear so the rebelscan download the data he's instructed to steal.This is a very interesting movie, it has incredible special effects, and you will believe thereis a rotating wheel parked about 100 miles up that contains this wonderful dreamscape calledElysium. But about 2/3 through the movie the wheels fall off and one of the reasons is JodieFoster. She's terrible (I'm not talking about her legs), and in addition to looking a littletoo hawkish, and in major need of botox treatments, her weak Margaret Thatcher imitation justdoesn't work, right down to a fake accent (WTF?). For an actress of her acclaim its quitedistracting.I felt like the ending was rather predictable and anticlimactic.

Over 140 years in the future, those on Elysium, a huge orbiting space station with an artificial earth environment, live pampered lives with access to medical care that can cure any illness and nearly any injury. Those on earth live in a polluted environment, work meaningless low paying jobs with zero access to Elysium's state-of-the-art medical care. (Not much changes in the future - that's the underlying message of the movie!) The goal of all is to buy a counterfeit citizenship for Elysium and be illegally smuggled to said space station.While Matt Damon did a credible job as the ex-con Max who must get to Elysium to cure his radiation poisoning (caused by an unfeeling corporation, nothing changes there either), the movie overall was not worth the price of the ticket. The plot is contrived and makes little sense, the action/fight scenes are impossible to follow given the rapid camera movement and angle changes, and the audience is never given an opportunity to invest in or much care for any one character. The last fifteen minutes forces you to suspend your common sense. The code for a computer program that will reboot the entire computer system of Elysium is locked in Max's head and must be uploaded to Elysium's mainframe computer or all is lost.  It simply defies all logic that Max's supporters manage to illegally land their ship with zero opposition - all other illegal ships tended to be destroyed by the stations defense forces (called Homeland Security no less) - and then encounter little in way of security (human or android) before reaching the undefended, unpassword protected, and easy to use computer console that controls everything. Furthermore, the computer code stored in Max's brain was completely unencrypted, required no password to view or install, and, finally, resulted in irrevocable changes to the computers running Elysium's defense and support functions (or at least the joyful ending would have us believe).  One always has to suspend a certain level of belief for a scifi movie, but Elysium asks us to check our brains at the door of the theater.If you like action without letup, computer generated backgrounds galore, an excess of profanity, and illogical plots then this movie is for you.  I went to see it because I was impressed with ""District 9"" and generally like any Matt Damon movie. However, do not waste your money at the theater.

1555159,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B008JFUN50,I'm Right,"[5, 8]","Neil Blomkamp's follow up to District 9 is a serviceable disappointment. After the excellent District 9 perhaps it's unfair to draw comparisons, but this film has many similarities without the gritty heart beating underneath District 9. In it, Earth is a dystopian bureaucratic nightmare where everyone is working to death while the upper class lives on Elysium, which is a colony in space where the rich dwell. Right off the start the story/message is contrived, with Matt Damon playing earnest ""joe everyman"" while the evil white collar rich are cold and conniving, helmed by Jody Foster in a very unmemorable role of ""evil business(wo)man"". So the characters are all pretty bland stereotypes, Matt Damon is good ol' hero, his childhood friend is the damsel in distress, and Jody Foster does the whole ""kill poor people so the investors are happy"" deal. The only character that was interesting was Sharlto Copley as the ruthless mercenary Kruger that gives Matt Damon a hard time. Hell I would've been way more interested if the movie revolved around adventures of Kruger.So the similarities to District 9 are abundant throughout the film, with an honest good character (Wikus/Matt Damon) who's fate abruptly changes for the worse (black goo/radiation poisoning), eventually becomes more powerful through it (prawn strength/robot suit), and tries to reach the deus-ex machina at the end (prawn cure/radiation cure), meanwhile shooting people all the way through who are led by a ruthless leader (Koobus/Kruger). Again, the action is well done and engaging, but everything else that worked in District 9 fell flat here. There's no connection to Matt Damon here like there was for Wikus in District 9 because his character is just so bland, he's even prophesied by a nun in the begin to do ""great things"". The prawns were a fascinatingly original allegory to the lower class, while Elysium's class parallels are blatant and stale.Part of the problem I think is having stars in this. Both Matt Damon and Jody Foster play their roles mechanically, and it makes me think Matt Damon is the star because the film's investors need a star to draw in box office attendance, instead of hiring someone who fits the role. The writing also carries some blame, since all we know about this character is that he likes staying alive & fulfilling promises to childhood friends. He's not a dorky paper pusher that Wikus was. Jody Foster as well, who has 0 humanity in her character leaves much unfulfilled, and leads to a problem with films like Elysium or Avatar, that if they want to be taken seriously, they need to humanize the villains and show you their perspective. Instead these movies are insultingly simplistic in that approach, further exacerbated by it making the obvious message the entire focal point of the movie by the third act, instead of dropping breadcrumbs. District 9 did this well by making you side with the humans from the get-go, thinking the aliens were weird bothers that the government were trying to help. Then as the film goes along with Wikus' transformation, we see the government as being the true monsters instead of the actual, monsters. It's a tired message sure, but it was an original perspective in District 9, here the script is so blatant and juvenile that I could see some little kid writing it.By no means is Elysium a bad film, it's all competently done, but the problem is that it merely stays mediocre and forgettable. The final 5 minutes or so was rushed, cheesy, and convenient. A more interesting movie could've been made after Elysium, where everyone can now go to Elysium (omg spoilers the good guys win!), how it would deal with overpopulation. Now there's an issue people haven't really tackled yet, lets ditch this class-warfare crap and see how a sci-fi film deals with the steadily rising human population, preferabbly starring Shartlo Copley.tl;dr Elysium is basically District 9, but bigger and dumber.",3,Sophomore Slump,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,3944,"['Neil', 'Blomkamp', 'follow', 'up', 'District', '9', 'serviceable', 'disappointment', 'excellent', 'District', '9', 'perhaps', 'unfair', 'draw', 'comparisons', 'film', 'many', 'similarities', 'gritty', 'heart', 'beating', 'underneath', 'District', '9', 'Earth', 'dystopian', 'bureaucratic', 'nightmare', 'where', 'everyone', 'working', 'death', 'upper', 'class', 'lives', 'Elysium', 'colony', 'space', 'where', 'rich', 'dwell', 'Right', 'start', 'story/message', 'contrived', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'playing', 'earnest', 'joe', 'everyman', 'evil', 'white', 'collar', 'rich', 'are', 'cold', 'conniving', 'helmed', 'Jody', 'Foster', 'very', 'unmemorable', 'role', 'evil', 'business', 'wo', 'man', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'bland', 'stereotypes', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'good', 'ol', 'hero', 'childhood', 'friend', 'damsel', 'distress', 'Jody', 'Foster', 'whole', 'kill', 'poor', 'people', 'investors', 'are', 'happy', 'deal', 'only', 'character', 'was', 'interesting', 'was', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'ruthless', 'mercenary', 'Kruger', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'hard', 'time', 'Hell', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'way', 'more', 'interested', 'movie', 'revolved', 'adventures', 'Kruger.So', 'similarities', 'District', '9', 'are', 'abundant', 'film', 'honest', 'good', 'character', 'Wikus/Matt', 'Damon', 'who', 'fate', 'abruptly', 'changes', 'worse', 'black', 'goo/radiation', 'poisoning', 'eventually', 'more', 'powerful', 'prawn', 'strength/robot', 'suit', 'tries', 'reach', 'deus-ex', 'machina', 'end', 'prawn', 'cure/radiation', 'cure', 'meanwhile', 'shooting', 'people', 'way', 'who', 'are', 'led', 'ruthless', 'leader', 'Koobus/Kruger', 'Again', 'action', 'well', 'done', 'engaging', 'everything', 'else', 'worked', 'District', '9', 'fell', 'flat', 'here', 'connection', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'here', 'was', 'Wikus', 'District', '9', 'character', 'just', 'so', 'bland', 'even', 'prophesied', 'nun', 'begin', 'do', 'great', 'things', 'prawns', 'were', 'fascinatingly', 'original', 'allegory', 'lower', 'class', 'Elysium', 'class', 'parallels', 'are', 'blatant', 'stale.Part', 'problem', 'think', 'having', 'stars', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Jody', 'Foster', 'play', 'roles', 'mechanically', 'think', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'star', 'film', 'investors', 'need', 'star', 'draw', 'box', 'office', 'attendance', 'instead', 'hiring', 'someone', 'who', 'role', 'writing', 'also', 'blame', 'know', 'character', 'staying', 'alive', 'fulfilling', 'promises', 'childhood', 'friends', 'not', 'dorky', 'paper', 'pusher', 'Wikus', 'was', 'Jody', 'Foster', 'as', 'well', 'who', '0', 'humanity', 'character', 'much', 'unfulfilled', 'problem', 'films', 'Elysium', 'Avatar', 'want', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'need', 'humanize', 'villains', 'show', 'perspective', 'Instead', 'movies', 'are', 'insultingly', 'simplistic', 'approach', 'further', 'exacerbated', 'making', 'obvious', 'message', 'entire', 'focal', 'point', 'movie', 'third', 'act', 'instead', 'dropping', 'breadcrumbs', 'District', '9', 'did', 'well', 'making', 'side', 'humans', 'get-go', 'thinking', 'aliens', 'were', 'weird', 'bothers', 'government', 'were', 'trying', 'help', 'Then', 'film', 'Wikus', 'transformation', 'see', 'government', 'being', 'true', 'monsters', 'instead', 'actual', 'monsters', 'tired', 'message', 'sure', 'was', 'original', 'perspective', 'District', '9', 'here', 'script', 'so', 'blatant', 'juvenile', 'could', 'see', 'little', 'kid', 'writing', 'it.By', 'means', 'Elysium', 'bad', 'film', 'competently', 'done', 'problem', 'merely', 'mediocre', 'forgettable', 'final', '5', 'minutes', 'so', 'was', 'rushed', 'cheesy', 'convenient', 'more', 'interesting', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'made', 'Elysium', 'where', 'everyone', 'can', 'now', 'go', 'Elysium', 'omg', 'spoilers', 'good', 'guys', 'win', 'how', 'would', 'deal', 'overpopulation', 'Now', 'issue', 'people', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'tackled', 'yet', 'ditch', 'class-warfare', 'crap', 'see', 'how', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'deals', 'steadily', 'rising', 'human', 'population', 'preferabbly', 'starring', 'Shartlo', 'Copley.tl', 'dr', 'Elysium', 'basically', 'District', '9', 'bigger', 'dumber']",N/A

It was also nice to see that sentiment ,humanism, and morality have reappeared in a very good epic. They even dared to show the influence of a Catholic nun on the young hero's upbringing. How many writers and movie producers have marginalized ethics and religion these days? It seems that there is a strong bias against anything smacking of spirituality and/or religion appearing in films. (With the exception of movies that are called strictly spiritual or religious or fantastic movies about the supernatural. Not that these are bad movies, the point is that we have forgotten our past and the ethical traditions that built Western Civilization.) We need to look at the history of ethics and remember that many brave men and women of the past have derived their faith and inspiration from religion/spirituality. There is  a strong secular bias in our culture against showing characters in movies who are really human and hold humanistic values. Most action heroes focus on violence, revenge, egotism, money, glory.This hero (flawed in the sense that he was once a thief) changed his behaviour and focused on those he loved and on humanity in general-in fact he willingly gave up his life for those he loved ( a very Christian way of looking at life and an example of practicing your beliefs to the point of death.)",5,Back to genuine heroes. kudos for the film makers.,1385856000,"12 1, 2013",2013,1501,"['IMHO', 'excellent', 'film', 'Great', 'see', 'real', 'heroes', 'who', 'are', 'genuine', 'people', 'Here', 'critique.Nice', 'see', 'main', 'actor', 'speaks', 'other', 'American', 'English', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'sentiment', 'humanism', 'morality', 'have', 'reappeared', 'very', 'good', 'epic', 'even', 'dared', 'show', 'influence', 'Catholic', 'nun', 'young', 'hero', 'upbringing', 'How', 'many', 'writers', 'movie', 'producers', 'have', 'marginalized', 'ethics', 'religion', 'days', 'strong', 'bias', 'anything', 'smacking', 'spirituality', 'and/or', 'religion', 'appearing', 'films', 'exception', 'movies', 'are', 'called', 'strictly', 'spiritual', 'religious', 'fantastic', 'movies', 'supernatural', 'Not', 'are', 'bad', 'movies', 'point', 'have', 'forgotten', 'past', 'ethical', 'traditions', 'built', 'Western', 'Civilization', 'need', 'look', 'history', 'ethics', 'remember', 'many', 'brave', 'men', 'women', 'past', 'have', 'derived', 'faith', 'inspiration', 'religion/spirituality', 'strong', 'secular', 'bias', 'culture', 'showing', 'characters', 'movies', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'human', 'hold', 'humanistic', 'values', 'Most', 'action', 'heroes', 'focus', 'violence', 'revenge', 'egotism', 'money', 'glory.This', 'hero', 'flawed', 'sense', 'was', 'once', 'thief', 'changed', 'behaviour', 'focused', 'loved', 'humanity', 'general-in', 'fact', 'willingly', 'gave', 'up', 'life', 'loved', 'very', 'Christian', 'way', 'looking', 'life', 'example', 'practicing', 'beliefs', 'point', 'death']",N/A

Jodie Foster dons a Christine Lagarde outfit and Bond villain accent to defend their Utopia in the sky by getting her spies to shoot down these ships - from Earth - using shoulder-mounted rocket launchers.After some intro title cards explaining all this (a bad start) and some twaddle about young Matt's child sweetheart (oh dear), the plot eventually kicks off when Matt Damon gets himself radiated in an industrial accident that had no reason to include radiation. Severely weakened with 5 days to live, for little reason they strap a half-ton exoskeleton to his bones that somehow makes him stronger. William Fichtner is the evil boss who put profit above safety in Matt's factory but conveniently enough also programmed all of Elysium's computers and can hack them so he's ripe for both some kind of comeuppance and fixing this social inequality issue using a hack.Meanwhile, Jodie Foster has a particularly evil henchmen who fires exploding self-guiding ninja stars that can hit anybody but Matt Damon. His accent is so strong, nobody within 1000 miles of the US is going to have a clue what he's talking about but that's ok since most of the time it's about how much he wants to find Matt. There is literally no other type of security on Elysium - not even one mall cop so this all becomes a showdown between Damon and the Heavily Accented Bad Guy. Fichtner meanwhile has the hack that's now in Damon's head and if only Matt can get to some computer on Elysium in time and hope the USB cable fits, everything will be ok.District 9 was great, Elysium not so much. Apart from the simplistic political messages scattered with a heavy hand, it suffers from occasionally risible dialog, 5th grade plot logic and a severe lack of characterization or plotting. There's just a lack of any complexity to keep the pace moving after about an hour and while the CG effects are very impressive they can't stop this short film starting to drag by the final act. It's a shame since I the sci-fi arena has been bare recently but I even though Elysium is mildly enjoyable if you switch your brain off, you're not likely to view a second time.",3,"Bad plot logic, great CGI and Christine Lagarde is apparently evil",1385683200,"11 29, 2013",2013,2563,"['Elysium', 'premise', 'poor', 'destitute', 'live', 'Earth', 'slums', 'enslaved', 'terrible', 'jobs', 'rich', 'live', 'Halo-like', 'planet', 'where', 'never', 'get', 'sick', 'old', 'spend', 'days', 'looking', 'down', 'Earth', 'universal', 'trashcan', 'counting', 'money', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'one', 'security', 'guard', 'whole', 'Elysium', 'Earth', 'immigrants', 'keep', 'trying', 'fly', 'illegally', 'knowing', 'ICE', 'enforcement', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Christine', 'Lagarde', 'outfit', 'Bond', 'villain', 'accent', 'defend', 'Utopia', 'sky', 'getting', 'spies', 'shoot', 'down', 'ships', 'Earth', 'using', 'shoulder-mounted', 'rocket', 'launchers.After', 'intro', 'title', 'cards', 'explaining', 'bad', 'start', 'twaddle', 'young', 'Matt', 'child', 'sweetheart', 'oh', 'dear', 'plot', 'eventually', 'off', 'when', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'radiated', 'industrial', 'accident', 'had', 'reason', 'include', 'radiation', 'Severely', 'weakened', '5', 'days', 'live', 'little', 'reason', 'strap', 'half-ton', 'exoskeleton', 'bones', 'somehow', 'stronger', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'evil', 'boss', 'who', 'put', 'profit', 'safety', 'Matt', 'factory', 'conveniently', 'enough', 'also', 'programmed', 'Elysium', 'computers', 'can', 'hack', 'so', 'ripe', 'kind', 'comeuppance', 'fixing', 'social', 'inequality', 'issue', 'using', 'hack.Meanwhile', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'particularly', 'evil', 'henchmen', 'who', 'exploding', 'self-guiding', 'ninja', 'stars', 'can', 'hit', 'anybody', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'accent', 'so', 'strong', 'nobody', '1000', 'miles', 'US', 'going', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'talking', 'ok', 'most', 'time', 'how', 'much', 'find', 'Matt', 'literally', 'other', 'type', 'security', 'Elysium', 'not', 'even', 'one', 'mall', 'cop', 'showdown', 'Damon', 'Heavily', 'Accented', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'Fichtner', 'meanwhile', 'hack', 'now', 'Damon', 'head', 'only', 'Matt', 'can', 'get', 'computer', 'Elysium', 'time', 'hope', 'USB', 'cable', 'fits', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'ok.District', '9', 'was', 'great', 'Elysium', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Apart', 'simplistic', 'political', 'messages', 'scattered', 'heavy', 'hand', 'occasionally', 'risible', 'dialog', '5th', 'grade', 'plot', 'logic', 'severe', 'lack', 'characterization', 'plotting', 'just', 'lack', 'complexity', 'keep', 'pace', 'moving', 'hour', 'CG', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'impressive', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'short', 'film', 'starting', 'drag', 'final', 'act', 'shame', 'sci-fi', 'arena', 'been', 'bare', 'recently', 'even', 'Elysium', 'mildly', 'enjoyable', 'switch', 'brain', ""'re"", 'not', 'likely', 'view', 'second', 'time']",N/A

1555172,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B008JFUN50,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[0, 0]","Neill Blomkamp's astonishing debut of DISTRICT 9 showed us that we could have bravura sci-fi films in this day and age that could not only function as a backdrop for cool effects, but could also have strong performances, nuanced social commentary and hellzapoppin' action set pieces. It is a modern masterpiece of science fiction cinema. So, naturally, when that film got the acclaim and attention that it deserved, and Blomkamp was given a bigger budget in which to give a larger palette to the audience, it should be brilliant, right? And to cast Oscar winners Matt Damon and Jodie Foster should make the performances even more vivid, right? And to have a story that deals with a very timely message about the haves and the have-nots should make it resonate even further, right?So then, why is ELYSIUM so... kind of... just average?It's 2154. The Earth isn't quite post-apocalyptic; it's just a huge planetwide slum. Pollution, over-industrialization, poverty, crime; it's just life now. And those who are fortunate enough to be wealthy have left Earth for an orbiting space platform called Elysium. It's perfect there. Life is elongated thanks to machines that can cure ANYTHING, and thanks to the rather zealous efforts of Elysium's Defense Secretary Delacourt (Foster), none of those grimy immigrants from Earth are going to make it to infect their idyllic society with their icky basic human needs. So while she's blowing illegals out of the sky, down below, Max (Damon) is a former car thief who's trying to get by as a blue-collar robot assembly worker. Through various events, he is blasted with a lethal dose of radiation and his only hope is to get to Elysium. But then there's a Che Guevara-esque pseudo-revolutionary, a lunatic Earth-bound sleeper agent of Delacourt's named Kruger (DISTRICT 9's Sharlto Copley), an old love interest (Alice Braga), her little daughter with leukemia, and a secret security code that has to be hardwired into a badass exo-skeleton, which also has to be drilled directly into Max's body as he is set up as the savior of the human race.My main problem with this film isn't the stock characters, or the somnambulant performance of Damon, or the ""Really, where am I from?"" accent that Foster sports, or the major plot-shift that comes OUT OF NOWHERE regarding Delacourt and Kruger, or the ham-fisted social commentary the film really hammers into your brain. It's the lack of substance. As to be expected, the film looks fantastic. The shot composition, the sfx; it's amazing to look at. But the film doesn't do anything to create a world for these characters to exist in. We know it's crappy on Earth and we know it's amazing on Elysium because the film tells us that. But it never really explores what else is going on up there or down here. It just IS, and we're expected to go along for that ride. Any attempt at real storytelling is pretty much absent and that's where the film fails. When we're treated to a vision of the future, as an audience, we want to exist there for a while. We want to know what the world is like, and that's where DISTRICT 9 succeeded so well. It was a smaller story about a single place on the planet, and it got you involved and it built that world to the smallest detail. ELYSIUM should be epic, considering that it involves the whole planet, but it just seems to focus on one neighborhood in a typically dystopian future. At least Copley seems to be having a really good time as the delightfully psychotic Kruger, and there's some fun to be had with the robotic law enforcement.I give ELYSIUM three stars out of five as opposed to its more deserved 2.5 because I firmly believe that, due to the incredibly brief running time of the film that there is a better, smarter and more complex cut of this film somewhere, and maybe someday, it will come to light.",3,"Smart ideas, but too heavy-handed, and too small-scale in its execution.",1388534400,"01 1, 2014",2014,3831,"['Neill', 'Blomkamp', 'astonishing', 'debut', 'DISTRICT', '9', 'showed', 'could', 'have', 'bravura', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'day', 'age', 'could', 'not', 'only', 'function', 'backdrop', 'cool', 'effects', 'could', 'also', 'have', 'strong', 'performances', 'nuanced', 'social', 'commentary', 'hellzapoppin', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'modern', 'masterpiece', 'science', 'fiction', 'cinema', 'So', 'naturally', 'when', 'film', 'got', 'acclaim', 'attention', 'deserved', 'Blomkamp', 'was', 'given', 'bigger', 'budget', 'give', 'larger', 'palette', 'audience', 'should', 'be', 'brilliant', 'right', 'cast', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'should', 'make', 'performances', 'even', 'more', 'vivid', 'right', 'have', 'story', 'deals', 'very', 'timely', 'message', 'haves', 'have-nots', 'should', 'make', 'resonate', 'even', 'further', 'right', 'So', 'then', 'why', 'ELYSIUM', 'so', 'kind', 'just', 'average', '2154', 'Earth', ""n't"", 'quite', 'post-apocalyptic', 'just', 'huge', 'planetwide', 'slum', 'Pollution', 'over-industrialization', 'poverty', 'crime', 'just', 'life', 'now', 'who', 'are', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'be', 'wealthy', 'have', 'left', 'Earth', 'orbiting', 'space', 'platform', 'called', 'Elysium', 'perfect', 'there', 'Life', 'elongated', 'thanks', 'machines', 'can', 'cure', 'ANYTHING', 'thanks', 'rather', 'zealous', 'efforts', 'Elysium', 'Defense', 'Secretary', 'Delacourt', 'Foster', 'none', 'grimy', 'immigrants', 'Earth', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'infect', 'idyllic', 'society', 'icky', 'basic', 'human', 'needs', 'So', 'blowing', 'illegals', 'sky', 'down', 'Max', 'Damon', 'former', 'car', 'thief', 'who', 'trying', 'get', 'blue-collar', 'robot', 'assembly', 'worker', 'various', 'events', 'blasted', 'lethal', 'dose', 'radiation', 'only', 'hope', 'get', 'Elysium', 'then', 'Che', 'Guevara-esque', 'pseudo-revolutionary', 'lunatic', 'Earth-bound', 'sleeper', 'agent', 'Delacourt', 'named', 'Kruger', 'DISTRICT', '9', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'old', 'love', 'interest', 'Alice', 'Braga', 'little', 'daughter', 'leukemia', 'secret', 'security', 'code', 'be', 'hardwired', 'badass', 'exo-skeleton', 'also', 'be', 'drilled', 'directly', 'Max', 'body', 'set', 'up', 'savior', 'human', 'race.My', 'main', 'problem', 'film', ""n't"", 'stock', 'characters', 'somnambulant', 'performance', 'Damon', 'Really', 'where', 'am', 'accent', 'Foster', 'sports', 'major', 'plot-shift', 'OUT', 'OF', 'NOWHERE', 'regarding', 'Delacourt', 'Kruger', 'ham-fisted', 'social', 'commentary', 'film', 'really', 'brain', 'lack', 'substance', 'be', 'expected', 'film', 'fantastic', 'shot', 'composition', 'sfx', 'amazing', 'look', 'film', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'create', 'world', 'characters', 'exist', 'know', 'crappy', 'Earth', 'know', 'amazing', 'Elysium', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'what', 'else', 'going', 'down', 'here', 'just', 'IS', ""'re"", 'expected', 'go', 'along', 'ride', 'attempt', 'real', 'storytelling', 'pretty', 'much', 'absent', 'where', 'film', 'fails', 'When', ""'re"", 'treated', 'vision', 'future', 'audience', 'want', 'exist', 'while', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'world', 'where', 'DISTRICT', '9', 'succeeded', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'smaller', 'story', 'single', 'place', 'planet', 'got', 'involved', 'built', 'world', 'smallest', 'detail', 'ELYSIUM', 'should', 'be', 'epic', 'considering', 'whole', 'planet', 'just', 'focus', 'one', 'neighborhood', 'typically', 'dystopian', 'future', 'least', 'Copley', 'be', 'having', 'really', 'good', 'time', 'delightfully', 'psychotic', 'Kruger', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'robotic', 'law', 'enforcement.I', 'give', 'ELYSIUM', 'three', 'five', 'opposed', 'more', 'deserved', '2.5', 'firmly', 'believe', 'due', 'incredibly', 'brief', 'running', 'time', 'film', 'better', 'smarter', 'more', 'complex', 'cut', 'film', 'somewhere', 'maybe', 'someday', 'will', 'come', 'light']",N/A

1555185,A20IPZQ38M96RB,B008JFUN50,J. Bakker,"[2, 4]","Full review at Metal Arcade.NetNeill Blomkamp&#8217;s 2009 film District 9 was an interesting sci-fi action flick that dealt with the issue of racism. The film was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars, and Blomkamp is out to prove that that film was no fluke, delivering another very solid summer blockbuster with Elysium. The film packs Hollywood star power like Matt Damon, Jodie Foster and William Fichter, while bringing his buddy and District 9 star Sharlto Copley along for the ride as well.Elysium once again deals with societal issues, this time namely overpopulation, poverty and immigration. In the year 2154, planet Earth is in ruin. Its inhabitants face a harsh climate, crime, and oppression, while the wealthiest humans live on a glamorous space station called Elysium &#8211; protected by robots and home to magic medical bays that can heal even the most serious of ailments in seconds. The people of Earth are willing to risk all to make it into Elysium by any means necessary. It&#8217;s an intelligent action film that demands a multifaceted actor like Matt Damon, who does some of his strongest work in his role as Max. Max is a poor citizen just trying to make his way on the forsaken Earth, when circumstances suddenly and drastically affect him, leaving a near-suicidal trip to Elysium his only option. While Max starts off as a morally ambiguous character, his story arc will see him making a stand for all of Earth&#8217;s citizens.While Matt Damon&#8217;s Max is an interesting and engaging anti-hero, Sharlto Copley&#8217;s mercenary Kruger threatens to steal the show. Jodie Foster is capable as the evil Secretary Delacourt, who intends to make a coup against the liberal government on Elysium. Delacourt&#8217;s plan is set into action with the help of Fichter&#8217;s John Carlyle, a businessman who&#8217;s made his billions off of the hard labor of Earth&#8217;s people, Max included. Diego Luna is solid as Max&#8217;s best friend Julio, who is willing to do whatever it takes to save his life-long buddy. The rest of the cast is decent, but forgettable.Elysium&#8216;s DVD release features two behind-the-scenes extras, pared down from the Blu-ray&#8217;s features but still worth a look. &#8220;Engineering Utopia: Creating a Society in the Sky&#8221; showcases the incredible talent at work to bring Elysium to the big screen in such a visually captivating fashion, with looks at concept artwork and early renderings as well as interviews with the artists. &#8220;Collaboration: Crafting the Performances in Elysium&#8221; interviews the film&#8217;s actors, and shows some funny on-set moments.While Elysium is perhaps a bit too grim of a story, and could have easily benefited from a bit more levity in the proceedings, overall Neill Blomkamp&#8217;s sophomore effort is a strong one. With plenty of exciting action, an intriguing story and stellar acting from Damon and Copley, this is a film no sci-fi buff will want to miss.",4,Neill Blomkamp&#8217;s sophomore effort is a strong one,1387497600,"12 20, 2013",2013,2969,"['Full', 'review', 'Metal', 'Arcade.NetNeill', 'Blomkamp', '8217', 's', '2009', 'film', 'District', '9', 'was', 'interesting', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'flick', 'issue', 'racism', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscars', 'Blomkamp', 'out', 'prove', 'film', 'was', 'fluke', 'delivering', 'very', 'solid', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'Elysium', 'film', 'packs', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'power', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'William', 'Fichter', 'bringing', 'buddy', 'District', '9', 'star', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'ride', 'well.Elysium', 'once', 'again', 'deals', 'societal', 'issues', 'time', 'namely', 'overpopulation', 'poverty', 'immigration', 'year', '2154', 'planet', 'Earth', 'ruin', 'inhabitants', 'face', 'harsh', 'climate', 'crime', 'oppression', 'wealthiest', 'humans', 'live', 'glamorous', 'space', 'station', 'called', 'Elysium', '8211', 'protected', 'robots', 'home', 'magic', 'medical', 'bays', 'can', 'heal', 'even', 'most', 'serious', 'ailments', 'seconds', 'people', 'Earth', 'are', 'willing', 'risk', 'make', 'Elysium', 'means', 'necessary', '8217', 'intelligent', 'action', 'film', 'multifaceted', 'actor', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'who', 'strongest', 'work', 'role', 'Max', 'Max', 'poor', 'citizen', 'just', 'trying', 'make', 'way', 'forsaken', 'Earth', 'when', 'circumstances', 'suddenly', 'drastically', 'affect', 'leaving', 'near-suicidal', 'trip', 'Elysium', 'only', 'option', 'Max', 'off', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'character', 'story', 'arc', 'will', 'see', 'making', 'stand', 'Earth', '8217', 'citizens.While', 'Matt', 'Damon', '8217', 'Max', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'anti-hero', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', '8217', 'mercenary', 'Kruger', 'steal', 'show', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'capable', 'evil', 'Secretary', 'Delacourt', 'who', 'make', 'coup', 'liberal', 'government', 'Elysium', 'Delacourt', '8217', 's', 'plan', 'set', 'action', 'help', 'Fichter', '8217', 'John', 'Carlyle', 'businessman', 'who', '8217', 'made', 'billions', 'hard', 'labor', 'Earth', '8217', 's', 'people', 'Max', 'included', 'Diego', 'Luna', 'solid', 'Max', '8217', 'best', 'friend', 'Julio', 'who', 'willing', 'do', 'whatever', 'save', 'life-long', 'buddy', 'rest', 'cast', 'decent', 'forgettable.Elysium', '8216', 'DVD', 'release', 'two', 'behind-the-scenes', 'extras', 'pared', 'down', 'Blu-ray', '8217', 's', 'features', 'still', 'look', '8220', 'Engineering', 'Utopia', 'Creating', 'Society', 'Sky', '8221', 'incredible', 'talent', 'work', 'bring', 'Elysium', 'big', 'screen', 'such', 'visually', 'captivating', 'fashion', 'looks', 'concept', 'artwork', 'early', 'renderings', 'as', 'well', 'interviews', 'artists', '8220', 'Collaboration', 'Crafting', 'Performances', 'Elysium', '8221', 'film', '8217', 's', 'actors', 'funny', 'on-set', 'moments.While', 'Elysium', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'too', 'grim', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'benefited', 'bit', 'more', 'levity', 'proceedings', 'overall', 'Neill', 'Blomkamp', '8217', 'sophomore', 'effort', 'strong', 'one', 'plenty', 'exciting', 'action', 'intriguing', 'story', 'stellar', 'acting', 'Damon', 'Copley', 'film', 'sci-fi', 'buff', 'will', 'want', 'miss']",N/A

Also, and this is key, the fight and action scenes are intense and immersive. You feel like you are in them as you watch.The plot is the classic Hollywood story split, and suspension of disbelief is a must to get the full ride from this movie. Part of the story takes place on Elysium , a highly secure, space habitat for the rich and wealthy. The other part of the story takes place on a wild and hairy 2154 Earth A.D. These stories evolve on their own and then merge to get the sparks flying.The acting is solid as you would expect. Everyone gives pretty tight performances that help make the movie that much more entertaining.In all, good sci-fi entertainment, that does what good sci-fi does: use the future to make you think about the present. It's a solid follow-up to District 9 for this director.And also, whatever your political beliefs are, set them aside and enjoy. The Day the Earth Stood Still, Planet of the Apes, Soylent Green, A Clockwork Orange, Starship Troopers all posed a possible future based on the filmmaker's imagination.

They are getting to the point where is it very difficult to pick them out.Ok with that out of the way.  Let's talk about the bad.Not entertainingWhy?1.  Poor character motivation/development (as in nearly zero)Max - criminal gone straight, but very selfish, doesn't do what's right until he pretty much has no choice, so what the heck I'll be the hero.2.  Unrealistic 1 dimensional characters (straw men and standard clich&eacute; Hollywood archetypes) at least 1 character needs to be relatable else all we are seeing is a bunch of people moving around saying stuff.Mother with dying child with a disease that is highly survivable these days (those mean rich people!)Everyone is dirty and poor (because of those mean rich people)Police are nothing but bullies and mean and brutal even though they are robots (again those rich people)Criminals are just misunderstood, but are really good (probably the rich people's fault too)Rich are greedy and hate everyone or are useless sheep (that some how became rich even though they are really stupid, so they don't deserve it) (what is with those rich people?)3.  Unrealistic social construct. Everyone is living in a giant slum.  So who is actually feeding them?  They just spend all their time being lazy, committing crimes, getting tattoos, and making babies (because of the rich people probably).  So you are telling me there are no condoms or birth control in the future?  I would think if the rich were that mean they would have mandated sterilizations using their evil cop robots.  I guess because they are extra mean rich people they'd rather see some of the nicest places on Earth become giant dirty slums if it means lifting a finger to help dirty poor people.4.  Unrealistic plot pacing.  5 days to live.  In that time we are going to organize and plan a kidnapping, conduct major surgery implanting cybernetic components as well as brain implants, get the data, fly to orbit, take over the space station, and save everyone?  Sure they will.5.  Unrealistic plot points.  Ok so let me get this straight.  The mean rich people have a button they can push that keeps all the shuttles grounded from LA, but yet they let anyone just fly up so they can shoot them down with an &#34;illegal&#34; sleeper agent, huh?  or have large enough numbers of illegals that requires dedicated massive holding cages and a big space buss with &#34;deportation&#34; painted on the side.  Oh wait that's right they are mean!They also have this magic box that will keep you young and perfect that obviously can work miracles in 5 minutes and require no resources to work and there isn't a SINGLE person anywhere that can afford one and be willing to go take it down to Earth to help all the poor people.  Wow really?  Last time I checked there is a whole industry in the present right now funded by and run by rich people that do that continuously.  Oh wait again I forgot, all rich people are mean.  So in the future they wouldn't ever do that.6.  Unrealistic hardware depictureLet me get this straight criminals sit around all day drinking and slappin their ho's and just happen to have advance networked tech, medical tech, cybernetic tech, weapons tech, earth to orbit shuttles, and plenty of cash to burn on the before mentioned booze and ho's and a ridiculous number of tats, but yet their fearless leader walks around with a limp and none of them can be bothered to take care of the needy poor people, or at least round up a few people to clean all the trash out of their shuttles before they launch them, or much less off the street, or maybe say install a window AC unit so they could be a little less sweaty?SummaryIf the goal of the movie was insult your intelligence, depict a certain group in society as mean, selfish, sadomasochists that like to kick puppies and to all around suck, then by all means it's 5 stars.

Two classes of humans exist in the world...the rich (mostly white) and the poor (mostly Latino).  The very wealthy white folks live on Elysium, a beautiful space station orbiting earth, and the very poor Hispanics and white convicts struggle to carve an existence on an apocalyptic-like earth.  This is the basic plot they give you and then the rest of the movie is dedicated to how the Latinos try to obtain the same lifestyle and affordable health care (Obama care) the Elysium citizens have on the space station.How do they go about it?  Hopping aboard broken-down space shuttles and trying to make a ""run for the orbital borders"" of Elysium.  However, this only gets them shot down.  Enter Matt Damon, an ex-con, who works for a robotic-cop manufacturing company.  One morning at work, he is exposed to a near fatal dosage of radiation, but since he is not a ""citizen"" of Elysium, he cannot receive their life-saving treatments.  Matt, who will die in five days, makes a bargain with one of earth's smartest hackers to kidnap a high-ranking, Elysium politician visiting earth, and download all of the man's cyber secrets into his own brain.  Of course, Matt has to become strong and cybernetic before he can achieve this feat, which involves them jamming metallic parts all throughout his brain and spinal cord.  The rest, including Jodie Foster's character is not even worth talking about.I loved the special effects, which was only about two percent of the movie.  Strangely, one thing I kept wondering about throughout the entire film was the lack of minorities, the black women, the Asians, the East Indians, etc.  The only ethnic group represented in the film are the poor Hispanics.

Rich against poor.  The haves and the have nots.  The whole point of the movie is to say - look how horrible &#34;they&#34; are.  &#34;They&#34; oppress the poor.  &#34;They&#34; don't want you to get medical care. &#34;They&#34; think they're better than the rest of us.  &#34;They&#34; want to keep you out.That's a pretty political theory, and certainly one that seems to trump up votes by disgruntled citizenry...but as a movie, it doesn't work too well.  Besides the &#34;us against them&#34; theme, there is no reason or plot for this movie.  The movie never explains how the division of earth citizens and elysim citizens occurred.  There is no history, no back story to put things into context.  Nor do they give any coherent explaination of why the people of Elysium are so hell bent on keeping the others out, or not providing even basic care.  A race that could build a space station as advanced as Elysium, build the space ships, the robots and the health chambers that apparently can cure any disease in under 10 seconds - that race could certainly also turn Earth into a paradise as well...the fact that they don't, or can't, doesn't make any logical sense.  ....so again, the whole point is nothing more than a morality play about how evil &#34;they&#34; are.  The writers don't even attempt to give the people of Elysium a personality or character build, they are only there to be &#34;the enemy&#34;.And very similar to politicians and liberals, the movie doesn't ask you or want you to actually THINK about the &#34;whys&#34; and &#34;how comes&#34;, they don't want to introduce a true two sided debate or discussion...they just want you to hate &#34;them&#34;.

Ironically, we both predicted the correct outcome for every character very early in the movie (according to their individual introductions) which was kind of a disappointment in terms of suspense.  We like movies where you guess an outcome and then are blown away on just how wrong you were.  However, that is only our feelings and thus you might feel completely different.  Some of the acting in this film was great, others&#8230;not so much.  We continuously were reminded of District 5 (which is understandable via who worked on this film) and Mad Max throughout the entire movie.  Sadly though, we feel Elysium (the ringed city itself) was just a mild twist to the Halos in the Halo video game series.  We love that series and noticed many background images held a more than familiar view from those found in the video games.  However, perhaps we are wrong and maybe Elysium was thought of prior to Halo or vice versa.  It was just odd that in Halo, there is a world on a ring (a halo) that floats in space, but in that case people avoided it to not destroy all species.  In Elysium, it is a world on a ring-like structure, but everyone want's to be on it to save the species.  In either case it is a good movie, but the plot was missing something for both of us.  However, this is just our view, and anyone without Halo playing knowledge might truly love the images presented.  Even if you do have Halo knowledge, the way the images are presented make you excited to know what a Halo movie could be like.To sum this review up:-Will we watch this movie again? Definitely.-Was it enjoyable to watch? Yes.-Did we feel for and/or relate to the characters? Sometimes.-Did it have a strong and original plot? No.-Were the outcomes predictable? To us, very predictable.-Is it one of the best movies we've seen? No.Overall, it is a good film, but not the best.

Overly ideological movies generally overstate their cause and oversimplify the message. Hollywood makes unbelievable movies, but I am continually shocked at how horribly big ticket movies are written.The acting was wonderful for an action movie aside from Jody Foster who was terrible. The special effects and cinematography was creative and smart. The question that comes to my mind is why not spend more money on some scriptwriters? Patch the glaring holes that have been stated in previous reviews. The movie simply looks like it has taken place in Mexico City - If I was of Hispanic origin, I may be a little offended by the fact everyone is either Spanish or Mexican. If I was a xenophobe this movie would have just re-affirmed my beliefs.This movie is terrible. Why would a space station have the ability to cure all the sick on earth? Why wouldn't the advancements in management be applied in the future as it is today? Such as understanding the value of human capital, or the use of finite resources.  If curing the worlds problems was as simple as providing aid, much of what the United States and NATO  already spend Billions attempting each year, would not these future citizens do the same?If the directors had brought in a few political experts and some outside writers this movie would have easily been very enjoyable.

1555238,AVQDTTQJLNM5L,B008JFUN50,JT,"[0, 0]","Elysium has an IMdb 6.7 which is not shabby, It's worth seeing and has a lot of redeeming qualities. It is better than just &#34;okay&#34; and has more &#34;I like it&#34; moments than &#34;I don't like it&#34; moments but not enough to give it a general recommendation. If you liked District 9, you will probably like Elysium. If you thought Oblivion was 1,000% better than District 9, you should skip Elysium.Some reviewers incorrectly criticize the acting. The acting is actually the most redeeming factor of Elysium. Matt Damon and Jodi Foster put in stellar performances as does the villain Kruger played by Sharlto Copley (&#34;Wikus&#34; from District 9) who is clearly a super talented actor showing two great performances of very different characters.Jodi Foster does a great job of being an elitist snob who speaks with an Elysium accent which is cleverly chosen to be based on French. This shows someone involved with the script is educated. Historically, French is the language of the elitist classes. Until relatively recently the English nobility including the Monarch spoke French at Court and among themselves to be aloof from the common people.The problem with Elysium lies with the lack of character development, weak science fiction and excessive action sequences, not the acting.The premise of the story is excellent as is the cast and production values.The elements of a great sci-fi drama/adventure film are all there but are not put together properly.The Frey + Max romance is not developed at all. There is a notion of a childhood friendship but not a romantic relationship. Yet, the commitment required for someone to help as much as Frey did has to be either strong friendship bond or romantic. And then 3/4 into it, Frey turns into an opportunist -- not a friend or a lover.Frey's demands for Max to take her daughter with him show she doesn't care about Max and just wants Max to heal her daughter (from some other relationship that is never explained). So the warm feelings for Frey get tossed out and her motivations for ever helping Max become suspect.By the end, Frey is just a moocher preying on Max's determination to make it to Elysium to save his own life and her daughter's because she has thrust that burden on him. The attempt to have Max and the daughter connect with some shared story is an obvious, feeble attempt to save a fatally broken plot.And Max is lethally dosed before we care much about whether he lives or dies. I mean at the time, we think heck, dying is better than that dead end abyss he's condemned to wallow in. He's living alone, doing nothing of consequence without any hope for anything to improve. Then suddenly, he's got to go &#34;back&#34; to Spider and offer to work for him &#34;again&#34;. The previous relationship with Spider is all news to the audience and we don't know whether Spider is a good guy or bad guy -- he's a gangster of course but seems to be on Max's side.And then, bang, bang, bang and everyone is on Elysium shooting at each other.Too much time is spent trying to make an unrealistic and improperly established on-Elysium ad hoc fire fight into a meaningful climatic final battle between villain and hero. It falls flat because the villain and hero barely know who each other are and the vilain is unrealistically resurrected in a deus ex machina.And then Spider shows up tapping on keyboards all ready take over the entire Elysium complex because he has a code for a &#34;reboot&#34; that can make someone president!? I mean really, no one is going to question why there's a new president that they didn't elect? What? Spider pulls another deus ex machina and voila! everyone is a citizen with the same &#34;reboot&#34; code that was going to make Jodi Foster president. What?

A man (Damon) takes on a mission in an attempt to save his life and finds that he could bring equality to everyone.My first thoughts at this movie is that it initially reminded me a bit of the old Mad Max or Blade Runner movies with its almost post apocalyptic view of the world in the future. The scenery and special effects are well done and have a bleak realistic feel to it. The movie plot itself starts a bit slowly attempting to develop the character that Damon plays and sometimes tends to be a bit preachy. Although it does start slowly, it gave me enough to keep me interested in watching. Damon does a decent job in the role and Jodie Foster as well does well as the villain in space.

But, the relentless marketing of Elysium prepared me for something grander and more interesting than what I got.  The cover of Entertainment Weekly, for example, way back in May, that read ""Neill Blonkamp Saves the Summer Blockbuster.""If not for that letdown, I'd give this show an A +.  Any movie that puts Jodie Foster in it--here at her most scary and all too human a role, a capitalist driven to shady measures--rather like the part she played in the Spike Lee movie about the heist--any movie with Jodie in it automatically gets a pass from me because she is a genius actor!  Matt Damon is not so lucky, and I don't mean even to hint at the spoilers, but I just mean his role is sort of undeveloped and just like the working class of the world he rarely gets to speak his mind or change expression.  However maybe I'm wrong, because Diego Luna as Julio, Max's best friend, is very expressive, almost languid like Oscar Wilde, and lacks the bruises and welts the makeup artists have painted all over Matt's body.  He seems to have wandered in from another movie, perhaps one that Merchant and Ivory were about to make when they died.The movie seems to pivot on the great coincidence of Matt wandering into the only emergency ward in which his childhood sweetheart happens to be working and happens to be on staff.  What?  Well, they were careful to make the point that few medical services exist to help out the poor, but still!

1555248,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B008JFUN50,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[0, 0]","Let me start by saying: this movie wasn't nearly as bad as advance reviews led me to believe. I expected a long, preachy, didactic slog, not the smart, fast-paced, often funny movie I actually saw. Perhaps professional reviewers have fallen into the trap, much suffered by amateur reviewers (quit lookin' at me like that), of being smug hipsters, too cool for the room. It ain't that bad, folks, but heavens above, it ain't good, either.This movie recycles themes beloved of science fiction movies, from Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" to William Gibson's ""Johnny Mnemonic,"" even back to HG Wells' ""The Time Machine,"" about technocratic dystopia and the unbridgeable gap between prosperity and poverty. By lifting the wealthy elite completely off earth, which is blighted by climate change, this film contemporizes images long familiar to science fiction devotees. Sure, it's hardly new; but you knew, going in, you'd see an already familiar story.A triumph of design, this film features shots distinctly reminiscent of classics like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""The Omega Man."" The contrast between lush Elysium, a capital station comprised entirely of suburban mansions in the Spanish Colonial style, and bleak, yellow-filtered Earth, emphasizes the moral message dramatically without speaking a word. Okay, neither desertified Earth nor urban sprawl Elysium could possibly produce enough food to be self-sustaining, but don't get bogged down in details.But the characters and plot don't match the physical design. Jodie Foster, as Elysium's defense minister, plays every scene with a ramrod-straight marching cadence, like C-3PO, and a wierd Anglo-French accent that, I guess, is supposed to sound menacing. Matt Damon, as the dying rebel supersoldier, has more latitude for organic moments, but doesn't really use them, remaining beholden to the plot. The supporting ensemble, including love interest Alice Braga and evil mercenary Sharlto Copley, play every scene at exactly the same level.Writer-director Neill Blomkamp, already famous for ""District 9,"" continues that film's trend of dramatizing and exaggerating contemporary political themes. Where the prior film dealt with race, this one portrays economic injustice. He depicts an automated police force that keeps the poor in line, that specifically exempts the rich from criminal consequences. The parallels to current events are obvious, even heavy-handed if you don't support Blomkamp's mildly liberal views. Or if you do.For what it is, this isn't a half-bad film. While it probably won't prove as durable as ""District 9,"" since the resemblance between the two is obvious; you know how it is with sequels. Its use of science fiction standards to address contemporary issues, while not revolutionary, is at least interesting. But watching it continue unfolding, long after its point is thoroughly made, left me frustrated. As it unfolded very, very slowly, I whispered to my date: ""This goes on a bit, doesn't it?"" And when it ended, I said, quote, ""Meh.""",3,"Interesting, But Really Long, Preachy Sci-Fi",1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,3013,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'advance', 'reviews', 'led', 'believe', 'expected', 'long', 'preachy', 'didactic', 'slog', 'not', 'smart', 'fast-paced', 'often', 'funny', 'movie', 'actually', 'saw', 'Perhaps', 'professional', 'reviewers', 'have', 'fallen', 'trap', 'much', 'suffered', 'amateur', 'reviewers', 'quit', 'lookin', 'being', 'smug', 'hipsters', 'too', 'cool', 'room', 'ai', ""n't"", 'bad', 'folks', 'heavens', 'ai', ""n't"", 'good', 'either.This', 'movie', 'recycles', 'themes', 'beloved', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'Metropolis', 'William', 'Gibson', 'Johnny', 'Mnemonic', 'even', 'back', 'HG', 'Wells', 'Time', 'Machine', 'technocratic', 'dystopia', 'unbridgeable', 'gap', 'prosperity', 'poverty', 'lifting', 'wealthy', 'elite', 'completely', 'earth', 'blighted', 'climate', 'change', 'film', 'images', 'long', 'familiar', 'science', 'fiction', 'devotees', 'Sure', 'hardly', 'new', 'knew', 'going', ""'d"", 'see', 'already', 'familiar', 'story.A', 'triumph', 'design', 'film', 'shots', 'distinctly', 'reminiscent', 'classics', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'Omega', 'Man', 'contrast', 'lush', 'Elysium', 'capital', 'station', 'comprised', 'entirely', 'suburban', 'mansions', 'Spanish', 'Colonial', 'style', 'bleak', 'yellow-filtered', 'Earth', 'moral', 'message', 'dramatically', 'speaking', 'word', 'Okay', 'neither', 'desertified', 'Earth', 'urban', 'sprawl', 'Elysium', 'could', 'possibly', 'produce', 'enough', 'food', 'be', 'self-sustaining', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'bogged', 'down', 'details.But', 'characters', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'physical', 'design', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Elysium', 'defense', 'minister', 'scene', 'ramrod-straight', 'marching', 'cadence', 'C-3PO', 'wierd', 'Anglo-French', 'accent', 'guess', 'supposed', 'sound', 'menacing', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'dying', 'rebel', 'supersoldier', 'more', 'latitude', 'organic', 'moments', ""n't"", 'really', 'use', 'remaining', 'beholden', 'plot', 'supporting', 'ensemble', 'including', 'love', 'interest', 'Alice', 'Braga', 'evil', 'mercenary', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'play', 'scene', 'exactly', 'same', 'level.Writer-director', 'Neill', 'Blomkamp', 'already', 'famous', 'District', '9', 'film', 'trend', 'dramatizing', 'exaggerating', 'contemporary', 'political', 'themes', 'Where', 'prior', 'film', 'dealt', 'race', 'one', 'economic', 'injustice', 'automated', 'police', 'force', 'poor', 'line', 'specifically', 'rich', 'criminal', 'consequences', 'parallels', 'current', 'events', 'are', 'obvious', 'even', 'heavy-handed', 'do', ""n't"", 'support', 'Blomkamp', 'mildly', 'liberal', 'views', 'do.For', 'what', ""n't"", 'half-bad', 'film', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'prove', 'as', 'durable', 'District', '9', 'resemblance', 'two', 'obvious', 'know', 'how', 'sequels', 'use', 'science', 'fiction', 'standards', 'address', 'contemporary', 'issues', 'not', 'revolutionary', 'least', 'interesting', 'watching', 'continue', 'unfolding', 'long', 'point', 'thoroughly', 'made', 'left', 'frustrated', 'unfolded', 'very', 'very', 'slowly', 'whispered', 'date', 'bit', ""n't"", 'when', 'ended', 'said', 'quote', 'Meh']",N/A

1555253,A2BDJOIXPR2AYU,B008JFUN50,King of Controversy,"[0, 0]","Another reviewer described this film as good, poor, people of color (led by Matt Damon - only because he is a box office draw) vs rich, evil whites. To me it was enough, having Jody Foster, especially Jody Foster, in the role of the villain for me to see something different. To me, in a way this film is about men vs women. This is a mindless, brute force is everything, action adventure movie selling the idea to the fairer sex that this (awesomely cool) violence is sometimes necessary. . . ?As with Neill Blomkamp's previous film, District 9, I'm unsure how I feel about Elysium. District 9 was a very impressively put together film but personally I didn't like it much. This film is not as good and I'm not sure I like it's message. It's taken as a given these types of things are going to have a 'mainstream' bent. In the incredible 'Matrix' film (which admittedly brings up the 'blue pill' and 'the red pill') the bad character is named 'Reagan'; in the recent comedy film I watched, 'The Dictator', at least twice they discuss the 'great dictators of the world' and list 'Chaney' as one of them. We discriminate against conservatives (at least 'none of them make movies') and we give ourselves awards for it? Here the 'message' contained in the film is only over done when we learn the security for Elysium is named 'Homeland Security'? The film may have possibly worked better with no space station at all?There are some problems in the film, beginning with a mercenary firing a surface to air missile all the way into space Towards the space station he's trying to protect (possibly as a way to introduce Sharlto Copley [who also played in District 9] into the film. There may be too many separate characters in Elysium. Or they are poorly integrated into the film. It would be nice to read what the later Roger Ebert would say about this film. . .  Mr. Ebert took some interest in the film makers previous work. Though it is no where near as good, I definitely want to give 'Elysium' the same 4 stars as I did 'District 9'. . .Another review of Elysium claims that the best science fiction makes you think about the present. This film is almost horrific in that sense. Matt Damon is forced to build the robots that abuse him, as one tiny example of how this film often hits close to home. Like the film District 9, the main character, in this case Matt Damon's character, is stricken by a deadly illness. When you're going to die, nothing else matters. Perhaps these illnesses simply provide a way for the director to get down and dirty with the action and motivations? Sharlto Copley, who played in 'District 9' plays a mercenary who gets fired by the rulers of Elysium. The film shows him moping around in his off duty hours, throwing stuff around, maybe kicking a can out of his tent. Thinking back on this, after the film was over, this behavior is similar to that of the alien 'Prawns' in that previous movie? For whatever reason, that filmed showed aliens who were base and degraded, if not more primitive than we are. Perhaps this was an alien ship full of mercenaries!'Homeland Security' aside, I'm not sure the more overt messages contained in the film are over done. Whether you believe in 'Global Warming' and think ill of those who deny it, or whether, not even for a nano-second of time in the past 30 years have you considered 'Global Warming' a possibility (looking no farther than the messenger), the messages contained in this film shouldn't be ignored. A friend of mine suggested this film highlights the dangers of over population. Whatever it is, this film does a better job showing us a possible future than any economic news report. While Elysium's pro violence (although perhaps this is simply pro working-class man) stance is definitely a negative, the rest of the film shouldn't. If, on some kind of beneath the surface level, this film promotes working-class men and their ideologies, it is a film warning us of the dangers of over population while it's effect will be one of increasing the birth rate? Perhaps the film 'celebrates' them (and the violence they'd like to do, or now like to do) because it aims to keep them working.

There is no entry to this eco-system for the rest of the people on Earth who are considered to be poor. It is controlled by a President, Patel and a power hungry Defense Secretary, Jessica. This eco-system has a clean environment devoid of any diseases and the capability to cure any kind of human disorder within seconds in a specialized medical bed call &#8216;Med Bay&#8217; accessible only for the citizens of Elysium - the main reason why all the people on the devastated earth want an access to Elysium. Jessica prevents illegal entries into Elysium through her dangerous ally on Earth, Kruger.Max de Costa, who works in a company called Armadyne, headed and owned by John Carlyle, which supplies arms and critical software to Elysium, once, accidentally gets exposed to radiation and is sacked, for he shall die in 5 days. Max wants to go to Elysium and get treated since he wants to live with his childhood girl friend Frey, but will be denied access. He approaches his old friend and arms smuggler Spider, who agrees to send Max to Elysium, provided, he gets the valuable software that controls the entire Elysium and Armadyne embedded in a chip stored in the brain of John Carlyle. Max agrees for the trade off, without knowing the underlying danger.At the same time, Jessica enters into a secret business deal with John, to create a software that could make her, the President of Elysium. John creates the same and stores it in his chip with an encryption that can be copied only to a similar chip but kills the person to whom it is downloaded in, for a reboot. Spider installs a similar chip into Max&#8217;s brain and downloads the software into Max&#8217;s, while John dies in the process. Knowing this, Jessica entrusts Kruger, to bring Max to Elysium and take control of the software, that could officially make her the President. Kruger, along with Max, Frey and her leukemia affected daughter, land in Elysium. Kruger suddenly turns against Jessica and kills her for an old time revenge and in the process tries to take control of Elysium, having coming to know of the deadly secret in Max&#8217;s brain.Ultimately, Max overpowers Kruger physically, and allows Spider to reboot the entire software of Elysium, that grants its citizenship and access to Med Bay, to the entire population on Earth, sacrificing himself to the good cause. The movie comes to an emotional end when Max dies after the re-boot but saves the entire world.A movie that creates a kind of fear and doubts who watches it, as to what the future has in store for them, if they do not have enough money to get access to the technology that can give them a decent living. Who said money cannot buy anything? At least, it might be required to keep our children alive.An excellent story, production and direction by Neill Blomkamp with a great cinematography, visual treat of possible futuristic machines, great sets, supplemented with star performance by Matt Damon (Max), Alice Braga (Frey), Sherlto Copley (Kruger) and sexy Jodie Foster (Jessica).",4,Future Shock,1384905600,"11 20, 2013",2013,3135,"['8220', 'Elysium', '8221', 'luxurious', 'living', 'environment', 'created', 'Space', 'very', 'rich', 'famous', 'entry', 'eco-system', 'rest', 'people', 'Earth', 'who', 'are', 'considered', 'be', 'poor', 'controlled', 'President', 'Patel', 'power', 'hungry', 'Defense', 'Secretary', 'Jessica', 'eco-system', 'clean', 'environment', 'devoid', 'diseases', 'capability', 'cure', 'kind', 'human', 'disorder', 'seconds', 'specialized', 'medical', 'bed', 'call', '8216', 'Med', 'Bay', '8217', 'accessible', 'only', 'citizens', 'Elysium', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'people', 'devastated', 'earth', 'want', 'access', 'Elysium', 'Jessica', 'illegal', 'entries', 'Elysium', 'dangerous', 'ally', 'Earth', 'Kruger.Max', 'de', 'Costa', 'who', 'company', 'called', 'Armadyne', 'headed', 'owned', 'John', 'Carlyle', 'arms', 'critical', 'software', 'Elysium', 'once', 'accidentally', 'exposed', 'radiation', 'sacked', 'shall', 'die', '5', 'days', 'Max', 'go', 'Elysium', 'get', 'treated', 'live', 'childhood', 'girl', 'friend', 'Frey', 'will', 'be', 'denied', 'access', 'old', 'friend', 'arms', 'smuggler', 'Spider', 'who', 'send', 'Max', 'Elysium', 'provided', 'valuable', 'software', 'entire', 'Elysium', 'Armadyne', 'embedded', 'chip', 'stored', 'brain', 'John', 'Carlyle', 'Max', 'trade', 'off', 'knowing', 'underlying', 'danger.At', 'same', 'time', 'Jessica', 'secret', 'business', 'deal', 'John', 'create', 'software', 'could', 'make', 'President', 'Elysium', 'John', 'same', 'stores', 'chip', 'encryption', 'can', 'be', 'copied', 'only', 'similar', 'chip', 'person', 'whom', 'downloaded', 'reboot', 'Spider', 'similar', 'chip', 'Max', '8217', 'brain', 'software', 'Max', '8217', 's', 'John', 'process', 'Knowing', 'Jessica', 'Kruger', 'bring', 'Max', 'Elysium', 'take', 'control', 'software', 'could', 'officially', 'make', 'President', 'Kruger', 'Max', 'Frey', 'leukemia', 'affected', 'daughter', 'land', 'Elysium', 'Kruger', 'suddenly', 'Jessica', 'old', 'time', 'revenge', 'process', 'take', 'control', 'Elysium', 'having', 'coming', 'know', 'deadly', 'secret', 'Max', '8217', 'brain.Ultimately', 'Max', 'overpowers', 'Kruger', 'physically', 'Spider', 'reboot', 'entire', 'software', 'Elysium', 'citizenship', 'access', 'Med', 'Bay', 'entire', 'population', 'Earth', 'sacrificing', 'good', 'cause', 'movie', 'emotional', 'end', 'when', 'Max', 're-boot', 'entire', 'world.A', 'movie', 'kind', 'fear', 'doubts', 'who', 'watches', 'what', 'future', 'store', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'money', 'get', 'access', 'technology', 'can', 'give', 'decent', 'living', 'Who', 'said', 'money', 'can', 'not', 'buy', 'anything', 'least', 'might', 'be', 'required', 'keep', 'children', 'alive.An', 'excellent', 'story', 'production', 'direction', 'Neill', 'Blomkamp', 'great', 'cinematography', 'visual', 'treat', 'possible', 'futuristic', 'machines', 'great', 'sets', 'supplemented', 'star', 'performance', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Max', 'Alice', 'Braga', 'Frey', 'Sherlto', 'Copley', 'Kruger', 'sexy', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Jessica']",N/A

This film is set 140 years into the future where the have nots, called 'Illegals' live  in cramped diseased conditions on what resembles Industrial Revolution conditions on Earth with the triage equivalent of medical treatment.  While the haves, called 'Citizens' live on Elysium, a space station orbiting Earth where they have resort style living and every 'Citizen' has a magical medical machine that cures any ailment and extends their life spans.  Matt Damon's character joins a group of rebels, lead by Spider, a heavily accented hacker, to penetrate the outer defenses of the space station in order to cure himself of radiation poisoning and make everyone a 'Citizen' so they can bring those magical medical machines back to Earth to cure the little sick children (which is the last scene of the movie).Unfortunately, this movie is nothing more than socialism wrapped in science fiction.  The action is great, but the story is really contrived and hits viewers over the head with it's all too familiar parallels of today's hot political issues in America like illegal immigration and government sponsored healthcare.  And if Jodie Foster's character wasn't based on Hillary Clinton, I don't know who she was supposed to resemble.  Her one line gave it away, 'I'm in charge of this station now Mr. President (who just so happens to be African American)!  Go do one of your campaign fund raisers, which is really what you're good at'.  And then both the director and Matt Damon claim with straight faces, that they weren't trying to make any political statements when creating this movie?  Yeah right! ROFLMAO!

1555257,AFOHUSVNZZ49W,B008JFUN50,K. Reynolds,"[0, 0]","NEILL BLOMKAMP, the South African director/writer who gave us &#8220;District 9&#8221; (2009), returns to science fiction in &#8220;Elysium&#8221; featuring Matt Damon as planet-bound worker drone Max and Jodie Foster as evil Homeland Security chief, Delacourt.While the Academy Award nominated &#8220;District 9&#8221; presented an exploration of segregation and prejudice depicted in a mock-documentary format, &#8220;Elysium&#8221; takes us to a time when differences between the 1% and the remaining 99-percenters have separated humanity into two environments.The bulk of humankind exists in a ruined, overpopulated Earth, where police and personnel/customer service droids mock the professionals they&#8217;re designed to emulate. The elite 1% live off-Earth in a gorgeous space station, where the grass is green and the mansions are supersized to accommodate a handful of plus-sized egos and fortunes. What is best about the film &#8211; the amazing design and effect work &#8211; is perfectly translated to Blu-ray with outstanding detail and believability. Fine detail is explicit and skin shades look natural. Ruined Earth is sandy and dry, packed with towering ghettos; everything is crumbling, dirty and sweaty. Life is fairytale gorgeous on Elysium, with stunning blue water, blue skies and flowering landscapes. It&#8217;s one big party and every home has a full-body medical scanner that can diagnose and cure the worst disease within minutes. Cancer? Don&#8217;t even think about &#8211; it&#8217;s gone almost as soon as it&#8217;s discovered in the cells.Damon&#8217;s Max is a thief, recently out of prison, and working at a recycling facility. An unnecessary accident bathes Max in radiation that will leave him dead within the week. He&#8217;s made to sign his &#8220;X&#8221; on a release form, given a bottle of pills to keep him operating &#8220;normally&#8221; until death, and escorted out of the med-center before he can dirty the sheets. Meanwhile, up on Elysium, Delacourt justifies her methods of keeping Planet Earth riff-raff separated from the elite population to President Patel (Faran Tahir) who disapproves.So it looks like an assassination is in order and Delacourt gathers her cronies to set it up, including arch-nasty, Kruger played by Sharlto Copley of &#8220;District 9.&#8221; Back on Earth, Max gets involved in a scheme to invade Elysium and, perhaps, equalize factions. He prepares by suiting up in a cyborg exo-skeleton and a lot of clich&eacute;s fall into place: A cute but poor kid with leukemia, an old girlfriend, the pal ready to sacrifice himself, and an evil senator. It all climaxes with some great looking rusty ships, a craft crash onto the pretty space station, massive firefights and a one-on-one showdown between Max and Kruger. This plays out well on the home surround system, with all the effects thundering through the walls, while dialogue &#8211; such as it is &#8211; remains clear.Special features for both DVD and Blu-ray include &#8220;Collaboration: Crafting the Performances in &#8216;Elysium,&#8217;&#8221; and &#8220;Engineering in Utopia: Creating a Society in the Sky.&#8221; Exclusive Blu-ray bonus features are an extended scene, and segments titled &#8220;Visions of 2154: An Interactive exploration of the art & design of &#8216;Elysium,&#8217;&#8221; &#8220;The Journey to &#8216;Elysium&#8217; &#8211; &#8220;Envisioning &#8216;Elysium,&#8217;&#8221; &#8220;Capturing &#8216;Elysium,&#8217;&#8221; &#8220;Enhancing &#8216;Elysium&#8217;&#8221;; &#8220;In Support of Story: The Visual Effects of &#8216;Elysium&#8217;&#8221; and &#8220;The Technology of 2154.&#8221;Unfortunately, nothing stands out among the extras, not even the extended scene. If you have seen any movie tech docs lately, there&#8217;s nothing new to be learned here. Interviews stand on how much everyone liked each other, although one point of interest (Spoiler Alert!) is when Copley talks about killing Jodie Foster&#8217;s character onscreen, the first time that&#8217;s been done in all the films Foster has made. Jodie advises that her kids will probably enjoy that bit.While not great science fiction, &#8220;Elysium&#8221; has its entertaining moments. Still, parallels to today&#8217;s society are so obvious as to break into the suspension of disbelief needed to bring its message home.",4,"Great effects, skilled actors on a crash course to medicore",1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,4347,"['NEILL', 'BLOMKAMP', 'South', 'African', 'director/writer', 'who', 'gave', '8220', 'District', '9', '8221', '2009', 'science', 'fiction', '8220', 'Elysium', '8221', 'featuring', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'planet-bound', 'worker', 'drone', 'Max', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'evil', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'chief', 'Delacourt.While', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominated', '8220', 'District', '9', '8221', 'presented', 'exploration', 'segregation', 'prejudice', 'depicted', 'mock-documentary', 'format', '8220', 'Elysium', '8221', 'time', 'when', 'differences', '1', '%', 'remaining', '99-percenters', 'have', 'separated', 'humanity', 'two', 'environments.The', 'bulk', 'humankind', 'exists', 'ruined', 'overpopulated', 'Earth', 'where', 'police', 'personnel/customer', 'service', 'droids', 'mock', 'professionals', '8217', 're', 'designed', 'emulate', 'elite', '1', '%', 'live', 'off-Earth', 'gorgeous', 'space', 'station', 'where', 'grass', 'green', 'mansions', 'are', 'supersized', 'accommodate', 'handful', 'plus-sized', 'egos', 'fortunes', 'What', 'best', 'film', '8211', 'amazing', 'design', 'effect', 'work', '8211', 'perfectly', 'translated', 'Blu-ray', 'outstanding', 'detail', 'believability', 'Fine', 'detail', 'explicit', 'skin', 'shades', 'look', 'natural', 'Ruined', 'Earth', 'sandy', 'dry', 'packed', 'towering', 'ghettos', 'everything', 'crumbling', 'dirty', 'sweaty', 'Life', 'fairytale', 'gorgeous', 'Elysium', 'stunning', 'blue', 'water', 'blue', 'skies', 'flowering', 'landscapes', '8217', 'one', 'big', 'party', 'home', 'full-body', 'medical', 'scanner', 'can', 'diagnose', 'cure', 'worst', 'disease', 'minutes', 'Cancer', 'Don', '8217', 'even', 'think', '8211', '8217', 'gone', 'almost', 'as', 'soon', '8217', 's', 'discovered', 'cells.Damon', '8217', 'Max', 'thief', 'recently', 'prison', 'working', 'recycling', 'facility', 'unnecessary', 'accident', 'bathes', 'Max', 'radiation', 'will', 'leave', 'dead', 'week', '8217', 'made', 'sign', '8220', 'X', '8221', 'release', 'form', 'given', 'bottle', 'pills', 'keep', 'operating', '8220', 'normally', '8221', 'death', 'escorted', 'med-center', 'can', 'dirty', 'sheets', 'Meanwhile', 'up', 'Elysium', 'Delacourt', 'methods', 'keeping', 'Planet', 'Earth', 'riff-raff', 'separated', 'elite', 'population', 'President', 'Patel', 'Faran', 'Tahir', 'who', 'disapproves.So', 'assassination', 'order', 'Delacourt', 'gathers', 'cronies', 'set', 'up', 'including', 'arch-nasty', 'Kruger', 'played', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', '8220', 'District', '9.', '8221', 'Back', 'Earth', 'Max', 'involved', 'scheme', 'invade', 'Elysium', 'perhaps', 'equalize', 'factions', 'suiting', 'up', 'cyborg', 'exo-skeleton', 'lot', 'clich', 'eacute', 'fall', 'place', 'cute', 'poor', 'kid', 'leukemia', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'pal', 'ready', 'sacrifice', 'evil', 'senator', 'climaxes', 'great', 'looking', 'rusty', 'ships', 'craft', 'crash', 'pretty', 'space', 'station', 'massive', 'firefights', 'one-on-one', 'showdown', 'Max', 'Kruger', 'out', 'well', 'home', 'surround', 'system', 'effects', 'thundering', 'walls', 'dialogue', '8211', 'such', '8211', 'clear.Special', 'features', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'include', '8220', 'Collaboration', 'Crafting', 'Performances', '8216', 'Elysium', '8217', '8221', '8220', 'Engineering', 'Utopia', 'Creating', 'Society', 'Sky.', '8221', 'Exclusive', 'Blu-ray', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'extended', 'scene', 'segments', 'titled', '8220', 'Visions', '2154', 'Interactive', 'exploration', 'art', 'design', '8216', 'Elysium', '8217', '8221', '8220', 'Journey', '8216', 'Elysium', '8217', '8211', '8220', 'Envisioning', '8216', 'Elysium', '8217', '8221', '8220', 'Capturing', '8216', 'Elysium', '8217', '8221', '8220', 'Enhancing', '8216', 'Elysium', '8217', '8221', '8220', 'Support', 'Story', 'Visual', 'Effects', '8216', 'Elysium', '8217', '8221', '8220', 'Technology', '2154.', '8221', 'Unfortunately', 'nothing', 'out', 'extras', 'not', 'even', 'extended', 'scene', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'tech', 'docs', 'lately', '8217', 's', 'nothing', 'new', 'be', 'learned', 'here', 'Interviews', 'stand', 'how', 'much', 'everyone', 'liked', 'other', 'one', 'point', 'interest', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', 'when', 'Copley', 'talks', 'killing', 'Jodie', 'Foster', '8217', 's', 'character', 'onscreen', 'first', 'time', '8217', 'been', 'done', 'films', 'Foster', 'made', 'Jodie', 'kids', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'bit.While', 'not', 'great', 'science', 'fiction', '8220', 'Elysium', '8221', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'Still', 'parallels', 'today', '8217', 's', 'society', 'are', 'so', 'obvious', 'break', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'needed', 'bring', 'message', 'home']",N/A

This is how the story goes: In the year 2159, two classes of people exist: the very wealthy, who live on a pristine man-made space station called Elysium, and the rest, who live on an overpopulated, ruined Earth. The people of Earth are desperate to escape the planet's crime and poverty, and they critically need the state-of-the-art medical care available on Elysium - but some in Elysium will stop at nothing to enforce anti-immigration laws and preserve their citizens' luxurious lifestyle. The only man with the chance bring equality to these worlds is Max, an ordinary guy in desperate need to get to Elysium. With his life hanging in the balance, he reluctantly takes on a dangerous mission - one that pits him against Elysium's Secretary Delacourt and her hard-line forces - but if he succeeds, he could save not only his own life, but millions of people on Earth as well.The cast led by Matt Damon (as Max) & Jodie Foster (as Delacourt) is great.

The set decoration by Peter Lando, set designs by David Clarke & Syd Mead, set dressings by Guy Roland, Liz Medrano, Cody Larson & Patrick Kearns is great. The costume design by April Ferry is great. The special make-up effects supervised by Joe Dunckley & the prosthetic make-up effects supervised by Sarah Rubano are great. The special effects coordinated by John MacCuspie & Cameron Waldbauer & supervised by Richard Taylor is great.

It is also, visually and thematically, great. This is a great follow-up for Neill Blomkamp after his debut with ""District 9"". Matt Damon is great as usual as Max & Jodie Foster is solid as Delacourt, while Sharlto Copley (as Kruger, reuniting with his ""District 9"" director) gives a great performance, as well.

Jodie Foster plays a heartless head of Homeland Security on Elysium, charged with keeping away illegal immigrants from earth. Matt Damon is a hard-working former con, now working in a factory, who is injured in an industrial accident, and whose only hope of survival is to make it to Elysium.

And again, what's with all the hand-held camera work and gratuitous street fights every film is having this days. In this film I really felt I was watching a CG enhanced version of Rockem'Sockem'Robots. It was a little old after a while.All that aside, there were some really good performances. Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting, The Departed) plays Max, who we learn from the beginning, is the kid from the slums who wants to get out and live where the rich people live. Where there is no sickness, diseases or stress. Oh and yes he has his childhood girlfriend who now has a daughter, who is ill (incentive to go to Elysium), who he still does pine for her still even 20 years later.Now what is Elysium? It's an elite, beautiful, and militarily protected by the government, orbiting space station where the truly elite, truly rich people of the human race now reside. There are medical devices where you simply just lie down in and with a scan of your body that takes but a second or two, and whether you have a pimple or full blown cancer and everything (literally everything) in between it is cured all within seconds! I wish!Guess where Matt Damon, his girlfriend Alicia Braga (I Am Legend, City of God) and her sickly daughter Emma Tremblay (Her first film) want to go? Of course running the defense side of the ""Homeland Security"" of the station was the most impressive performance in the film as done by Jodi Foster (Silence of the Lambs, Contact). She assigns Sharlto Copley (District 9, The A Team) to hunt, find and kill all three of them. Did I mention Matt gets suited up with a bio electrically connected suit that we get to see surgically implanted into his head and body? Yummy!Now throw in another dark character and amazing performance by William Fichtner (Contact, Armageddon) as the programmer of Elysium, who along with Jodi Foster, want to re program the government and take over from the current president played by Faran Tahir (Star Trek -2009, Iron Man), and you have several time bombs set in the story.Throw in yet another very cool performance by Wagner Moura (Elite Squad 1 & 2) as the underground resistance trying to take over Elysium because the rest of the planet Earth is now a wasted, polluted and disease ridden garbage can. The film has a few surprises, of course, and some great CG work, but other than Foster, Fitchtner and Moura's performances being very intense, Matt is Matt. He is the action hero with a chip on his shoulder and mission to complete. It ended as it should and left nothing really to the imagination.The space station Elysium itself is impressive as well as their medical technology portrayed in this film but not a whole lot of meat or heart. There is lots of explosions and fighting, not much more of the more interesting aspects of the society or their technology. Good fun, nice effects, lots of gratuitous fighting, nothing really more.",3,"""Elysium"" Shows The Future Isn't So Bright, For the Poor""",1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,3392,"['Writer', 'director', 'Neill', 'Blomkamp', 'District', '9', 'pulled', 'off', 'second', 'project', 'lot', 'grace', 'not', 'lot', 'passion', 'visuals', 'are', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'implied', 'futuristic', 'technology', 'amazingly', 'impressive', 'unfortunately', 'human', 'race', 'now', 'justification', 'characters', 'are', 'typically', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'underdog', 'dream', 'adult', 'mentor', 'child', 'mean', 'evil', 'villain', 'government', 'official', 'who', 'else', 'ambitious', 'sidekick', 'gone', 'rogue', 'etc..', 'again', 'what', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'work', 'gratuitous', 'street', 'fights', 'film', 'having', 'days', 'film', 'really', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'CG', 'enhanced', 'version', ""Rockem'Sockem'Robots"", 'was', 'little', 'old', 'while.All', 'aside', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'performances', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Departed', 'Max', 'who', 'learn', 'beginning', 'kid', 'slums', 'who', 'get', 'out', 'live', 'where', 'rich', 'people', 'live', 'Where', 'sickness', 'stress', 'Oh', 'yes', 'childhood', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'now', 'daughter', 'who', 'ill', 'incentive', 'go', 'Elysium', 'who', 'still', 'pine', 'still', 'even', '20', 'years', 'later.Now', 'what', 'Elysium', 'elite', 'beautiful', 'militarily', 'protected', 'government', 'orbiting', 'space', 'station', 'where', 'truly', 'elite', 'truly', 'rich', 'people', 'human', 'race', 'now', 'reside', 'are', 'medical', 'devices', 'where', 'simply', 'just', 'lie', 'down', 'scan', 'body', 'second', 'two', 'have', 'pimple', 'full', 'blown', 'cancer', 'everything', 'literally', 'everything', 'cured', 'seconds', 'wish', 'Guess', 'where', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'girlfriend', 'Alicia', 'Braga', 'Am', 'Legend', 'City', 'God', 'sickly', 'daughter', 'Emma', 'Tremblay', 'first', 'film', 'want', 'go', 'course', 'running', 'defense', 'side', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'station', 'was', 'most', 'impressive', 'performance', 'film', 'done', 'Jodi', 'Foster', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Contact', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'District', '9', 'A', 'Team', 'hunt', 'find', 'kill', 'three', 'Did', 'mention', 'Matt', 'suited', 'up', 'bio', 'electrically', 'connected', 'suit', 'get', 'see', 'surgically', 'implanted', 'head', 'body', 'Yummy', 'Now', 'throw', 'dark', 'character', 'amazing', 'performance', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'Contact', 'Armageddon', 'programmer', 'Elysium', 'who', 'Jodi', 'Foster', 'want', 're', 'program', 'government', 'take', 'over', 'current', 'president', 'played', 'Faran', 'Tahir', 'Star', 'Trek', '-2009', 'Iron', 'Man', 'have', 'several', 'time', 'bombs', 'set', 'story.Throw', 'yet', 'very', 'cool', 'performance', 'Wagner', 'Moura', 'Elite', 'Squad', '1', '2', 'underground', 'resistance', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'Elysium', 'rest', 'planet', 'Earth', 'now', 'wasted', 'polluted', 'disease', 'ridden', 'garbage', 'can', 'film', 'few', 'surprises', 'course', 'great', 'CG', 'work', 'other', 'Foster', 'Fitchtner', 'Moura', 'performances', 'being', 'very', 'intense', 'Matt', 'Matt', 'action', 'hero', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'mission', 'complete', 'ended', 'should', 'left', 'nothing', 'really', 'imagination.The', 'space', 'station', 'Elysium', 'impressive', 'as', 'well', 'medical', 'technology', 'portrayed', 'film', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'meat', 'heart', 'lots', 'explosions', 'fighting', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'more', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'society', 'technology', 'Good', 'fun', 'nice', 'effects', 'lots', 'gratuitous', 'fighting', 'nothing', 'really', 'more']",N/A

Also, I have no problem with movies that moralize. It's great to question things, propose new ideas, or just point at injustices in the hopes of raising awareness. I DO, however, have a problem when a movie ends up being both, especially since a lot of the time it ends up accidentally trivializing something I usually already care about. Case in point: Elysium.The story concerns Max, a reformed criminal who lives in a futuristic, devastated Los Angeles. The world, ravaged by pollution and overpopulation, is now filled with nothing but the poor and lower classes. If you're lucky, like Max, you have a job. In his case, he works for Armadyne, the company that produces the robots that police and monitor the world. All of the wealthiest people in the world, meanwhile, have created Elysium, a utopian space colony in orbit high above Earth, where they live in unbelievably crystalline splendor. They also have these magical beds that can instantly cure any disease or ailment in a matter of seconds. The poor folk on Earth, of course, must deal with second-rate health care that, while seemingly public, is dismissive and half-hearted. When an accident at work gives Max less than a week to live, he dons a superstrong exo-skeleton and undertakes a mission to make it to Elysium to get to one of those magic, medical beds. During the course of his mission, he finds his own selfish views challenged by corrupt senators, mind-bogglingly cute kids with leukemia, and a helter-skelter style military strong-arm named Kruger.Visually appealing with some stunning action sequences, the movie is a popcorn muncher from nearly the first frame (although I'm leaving out the first five minutes of clunky Hallmark-style exposition and character development, much of which involves a nun). Directed by the same guy who gave us the rousing and engaging District 9, the pacing, framing, and cinematography is pretty much top-of-the-line.The problem is that the script is about as heavy-handed as that big stone guy from The NeverEnding Story. The symbolism has got all of the subtlety of a sledgehammer, and when you step back and really think about the story, there's a whole lot that doesn't make sense. For instance, it's never clear why these medical beds are hoarded on Elysium. Do they use an excessive amount of power or resources? Is it considered economically or socially better to have the bulk of your citizenry in a state of malnourishment and filth? Do they break down easily? It automatically classifies the Haves of the movie as heartless and selfish for no real, good reason. Furthermore, the Haves are totemized in the cold, unforgiving character of Secretary of Defense Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster doing ... well, whatever kind of accent she was aiming for, the result was awful and distracting). Ms. Delacourt's machinations tend to be completely nonsensical as well. I won't give too much away, other than to say that some of her behavior hinges on the fact that Presidents, in this future, can be displaced by rebooting computer programs. It'd be like waking up one day and discovering that Sarah Palin is the President instead of Obama. &#34;But how? Why?&#34; we'd ask. &#34;This computer says she is,&#34; they say. &#34;Oh. Okay, then.&#34;Huh?Obviously a morality play about apartheid, social divisions, the economic gap, and human rights, the movie takes a message that I tend to agree with and makes it so cartoonish and implausible that it almost seems to be making fun of it. The action, the 'splosions, the cool fight scenes, and the various swooping, wooshing, clanking destruction of it all makes for some fun, mindless viewing, but when the movie tries to prove that it does have some kind of brainwave, it gets both in-your-face and nearly incomprehensible. In other words, the seriousness of the film has as much brassy, crazy fire as the shallower elements, making it all seem rather patronizing.Try not to think too hard about it, and you might enjoy yourself, but be warned. When it's not dazzling you with its pyrotechnic skill, the movie WILL try to get you to think. That's probably the point when you should get up for more popcorn.",3,A Movie That Asks You To Think ...

1555293,AR5XJEZR0LWWW,B008JFUN50,Mark,"[2, 5]","A friend recommended this move with some reservations and I decided to purchase it and see what I thought about it myself. First of all, there isn't a Sci Fi movie that I didn't like at least a little. Also, I'll admit, that I am also a Matt Damon and Jodie Foster Fan. So, how did Matt do? His character, Max, is all grown up into a street thug on parole in a run down city of the future.  He clearly knows how to act the part and plays the role really well - that's the thing about Matt Damon, he never lets you know he's just acting. Then there is Jodie Foster. Clearly she is playing a sophisticated security chief and does it well with an accent and an element of sophistication and deviousness, which is a polar opposite of Matt Damon's role, at least from the space station perspective. The plot was just a tad bit thin, but it's enough to keep my attention throughout the movie. Its not one of those plots that jumps out at the last minute, or keeps you wondering what it is. Its like a rail road train, you know where you are going the minute the train left the station. But, if its a trip from one end of the country to another, what route you take is another story. And that is what Elysium is all about. There are really great special affects. Just how do you get an atmosphere that you can breathe in space without an airlock and have it seem possible to us Sci Fi movie buffs? Watch and see. And what will the rich do with all that money someday? Well, it just figures! This movie has heroes, and sacrifice. It also has crazy people working for the bad guys, and only slightly crazy people who are fighting for a better way of life for everyone else. Its a possible outcome of our own world, the separation of classes, if we keep going down the path we are going, or at least one possible outcome if we do. The movie made me think, and I like movies that make me think. Besides a thin plot, and supporting actors that are just a bit more than mediocre,  the 'aha' moment allows you to forgive the shortcomings of this movie and wonder what you would do.

I truly wish that I could say that what is depicted in ""Elysium"" will never happen on earth and that harmony and unity is going to reign supreme within the next 25 years at the latest. However, it looks like a more unified world may not come about until at least 250 years from now. Additionally, it is becoming even more easy for the top 1% to create their own communities due to the socio-economic and racial segregation that still exists in many middle socio-economic class  and lower socio-economic class neighborhoods across America. There was an element of the immigration debate within the film. I have to confess that I am on the fence and undecided about the immigration issue because I would have to gather more information before making an informed decision on the still controversial matter. ""Matt Damon"" gave a compelling performance as a man who unexpectedly carries the responsibility of making the amenities of Elysium more accessible to a greater number of men and women. Jodie Foster  also gives a brilliant performance as an abrasive and shrewd politician who wants to preserve the culture of ""Elysium"" at even the most extreme of costs.

People on Earth are constantly trying to gain access to the orbital, but are dealt with harshly (although why the station has no defences of its own seems a bit odd).Max (Matt Damon) is an ex-con who is poisoned in an industrial accident and his only chance is to be healed in a med bay only available on Elysium.He teams up with a resistance movement to gain access to the station. Meanwhile up on the station a plot is unfolding and Max finds himself caught in the middle and hunted by one of her agents (who is a pretty nasty bad guy).For me the opening shots of Elysium were the high point of the film, they look lovely and there needs to be more of this type of thing in films (check out Cargo for something similar). From that point it's a blend of action and light political intrigue (Jodie Foster does a good job as the cold minister with her own plans for the station).It's all fairly predictable but still manages enough to be an entertaining watch.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[2, 3]","There are many things to like in ELYSIUM, writer/director Neill Blomkamp&#8217;s follow-up to his critically acclaimed first feature, DISTRICT 9.  This new sci-fi thriller is endowed with a compelling basic premise, good performances from Matt Damon, Jodie Foster and an international cast, impressive visual effects, plus some exciting action sequences.Set in the year 2154, ELYSIUM presents us with two classes of people: the very wealthy who live on a pristine man-made space station (Elysium), and everybody else who inhabit the overpopulated, ruined Earth.  The &#8220;evil rich,&#8221; led by Jodie Foster, want to keep the poor folks off of Elysium where they can be cured of all their ills, and it&#8217;s up to Matt Damon to lead a dangerous mission that might change all that.I think the picture&#8217;s problem is that Blomkamp wasn&#8217;t sure what kind of movie he wanted to make.  The film seems to be part futuristic science fiction, part espionage thriller and, at times, just mindless over-the-top action...with a strong ultra-liberal political statement thrown in for good measure.As a writer, Blomkamp has created a sometimes confusing &#8220;new world&#8221; in which the set rules seem to change on a whim.  For example, when is a dead person really dead?  In Elysium, one can never be sure&#8230;and we&#8217;re not talking zombies here.Non-discriminating action fans will definitely enjoy this one.The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment contains two &#8220;Behind the Scenes&#8221; featurettes.

If you just get over the intricacies of the stories and silliness of the whole ""health care"" theme, then you can find and enjoyable movie.  Matt Damon plays the main character, a drifter-like individual who lives on the futuristic earth which is now a big sh**hole, akin to the ghettos of a big major city.I found a qoute online from the director where he stated that the movie is not about the future, it is ""about now, things going on right now.""  Earth in this movie is the bad place, and the good place is a space station called 'elysium'.  I'm not sure why they called it elysium, considering how they presented it, they should have just called it Irvine.  Anyways, earth bad, elysium good, got it?As the movie unfolds, you see how dirty and polluted earth is and how clean and safe elysium is.  Earth is patrolled by a force of police-robots.  These robots are built on earth and we soon learn that Matt Damon works at a factory where the robots are built; how uplifting...There's a subplot involving a sick kid and rebel force whose goal is to invade elysium.  On elysium, the citizens can be treated by a medical machine that will cure any ailment you have, including disease, broken bones, etc...  I don't remember if the movie explains if these machines are in the people's homes are at the hospital, but either way, Damon gets caught up in  a plan to get to elysium, hack the sysytem so everyone can become citizens and have access to these machines and be able to save the sick girl.So as you have figured out by know hopefully, yes, the movie is about free health care for everyone.  If you don't enjoy that part of the movie and can get over it, there's an interesting movie aside, and you see Damon take on the police-robots(with the help of a mechanic torso) and his journey to elysium while being targeted by an assassin(played by the guy who was Mudoch on the recent A-Team movie) sent by the powers of elysium.As a sci-fi movie, it is entertaining, there's many shots of the landscape of earth, the sky is bright white and you understand the idea behind it that space travel has become so easy that elysium and likewise other plants are just a hop on a plane away; the only problem with the whole scenario being the division of humans in an ""ideal"" place and into the not so ideal place(like the Time Machine).This movie is definitely worth a viewing, just don't expect Blade Runner level imagination.",3,"This movie has a somewhat lame story, but it is a decent movie",1386806400,"12 12, 2013",2013,2485,"['movie', 'somewhat', 'lame', 'story', 'decent', 'movie', 'just', 'get', 'intricacies', 'stories', 'silliness', 'whole', 'health', 'care', 'theme', 'then', 'can', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'main', 'character', 'drifter-like', 'individual', 'who', 'futuristic', 'earth', 'now', 'big', 'sh**hole', 'akin', 'ghettos', 'big', 'major', 'city.I', 'found', 'qoute', 'online', 'director', 'where', 'stated', 'movie', 'not', 'future', 'about', 'now', 'things', 'going', 'right', 'now', 'Earth', 'movie', 'bad', 'place', 'good', 'place', 'space', 'station', 'called', ""'elysium"", ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'called', 'elysium', 'considering', 'how', 'presented', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'called', 'Irvine', 'Anyways', 'earth', 'bad', 'elysium', 'good', 'got', 'movie', 'unfolds', 'see', 'how', 'dirty', 'polluted', 'earth', 'how', 'clean', 'safe', 'elysium', 'Earth', 'patrolled', 'force', 'police-robots', 'robots', 'are', 'built', 'earth', 'soon', 'learn', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'factory', 'where', 'robots', 'are', 'built', 'how', 'uplifting', 'subplot', 'involving', 'sick', 'kid', 'rebel', 'force', 'goal', 'invade', 'elysium', 'elysium', 'citizens', 'can', 'be', 'treated', 'medical', 'machine', 'will', 'cure', 'ailment', 'have', 'including', 'disease', 'broken', 'bones', 'etc', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'movie', 'machines', 'are', 'people', 'homes', 'are', 'hospital', 'way', 'Damon', 'caught', 'up', 'plan', 'get', 'elysium', 'hack', 'sysytem', 'everyone', 'can', 'become', 'citizens', 'have', 'access', 'machines', 'be', 'able', 'save', 'sick', 'girl.So', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'know', 'hopefully', 'yes', 'movie', 'about', 'free', 'health', 'care', 'everyone', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'part', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'interesting', 'movie', 'aside', 'see', 'Damon', 'take', 'police-robots', 'help', 'mechanic', 'torso', 'journey', 'elysium', 'being', 'targeted', 'assassin', 'played', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'Mudoch', 'recent', 'A-Team', 'movie', 'sent', 'powers', 'elysium.As', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'many', 'shots', 'landscape', 'earth', 'sky', 'bright', 'white', 'understand', 'idea', 'space', 'travel', 'become', 'so', 'easy', 'elysium', 'likewise', 'other', 'plants', 'are', 'just', 'hop', 'plane', 'away', 'only', 'problem', 'whole', 'scenario', 'being', 'division', 'humans', 'ideal', 'place', 'not', 'so', 'ideal', 'place', 'Time', 'Machine', '.This', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'level', 'imagination']",N/A

If you happen to disagree that the future of capitalism will lead to a widening rift between upper and lower class, you are going to find this film highly unpalatable.  ""Elysium"" drives this point home with a capital ""E"".  But if you are willing to entertain the idea that the increase of have nots is a trend, ""Elysium"" is here to tell you that by 2154 Earth is going to turn into a toilet.Our protagonist Max Da Costa (Matt Damon) is a man from a difficult past trying to make good by following the rules.  Well, almost -- he's still a wise ass, particularly when it comes to being interrogated by the robots that enforce the law in a world teeming with crowded humanity.  Once we see what Da Costa does for a living it's easy to see why; he BUILDS the same robots that oppress him. After mouthing off to a bot and getting his arm broken, Da Costa crosses paths with his old childhood flame, Frey (Alice Braga).  Frey's daughter Matilda is dying of leukemia, but that's not enough to motivate Da Costa to risk his life to save her.  And her salvation lies in a Stanford torus known as Elysium, where the rich live with robot servants and cure-all medbays that fix every conceivable ill.A word about Elysium from Greek myth, an afterlife for demigods and heroes, from Pindar's Odes:...the good receive a life free from toil, not scraping with the strength of their arms the earth, nor the water of the sea, for the sake of a poor sustenance. But in the presence of the honored gods, those who gladly kept their oaths enjoy a life without tears, while the others undergo a toil that is unbearable to look at.The ""toil that is unbearable to look at"" is Earth.  Da Costa finds himself irradiated in a blatant EHS violation that ensures he'll be dead in five days.  With nothing to lose, he reconnects with former criminal employer Spider (Wagner Moura), a near unintelligible gangster with big plans.  He regularly smuggles the desperate to Elysium so they get a chance at healing, but with Da Costa he has bigger plans: the kidnapping of an executive.  Da Costa agrees on one condition.  He wants to go after the CEO of the company where Da Costa was irradiated, CEO John Carlyle (William Fichtner).  The catch is that Carlyle is in the midst of a coup against Elysium by Secretary of Defense Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster, sporting an odd French accent). When Da Costa ambushes Carlyle and downloads his brain, he picks up more than he bargained for, and thus a cat-and-mouse game enuses between Da Costa and sleeper agent Kruger (Sharlto Copley, nearly unintelligible with his accent).  Kruger's chasing Da Costa, and Da Costa's chasing a dream, saddled by guilt that the love of his life's daughter will die soon if he doesn't do something.And oh yeah, Da Costa wears an exoskeleton that has some Christ-like allegories if you squint at Damon when he stretches his arms out.What ensues is a lot of shaky-cam combat in director Neill Blomkamp's trademark dirty sci-fi universe, the same backdrop that was so effective in ""District 9.""  This is an ugly war in an ugly place, and ""Elysium"" doesn't have many nice things to say about just about everyone involved.  But that's what makes it so compelling, and what makes the film worth watching.  Yes, there's often some logic leaps between scenes, and the transition between scenes and sets seems to be so tenuous as to be nearly ethereal, but this message movie has an interesting tale to tell if we're willing to listen...cybernetics and gunfights not withstanding.",4,An ugly war in an ugly place,1378252800,"09 4, 2013",2013,3635,"['opinion', 'Elysium', 'will', 'likely', 'hinge', 'opinion', 'income', 'inequality', 'how', 'healthcare', 'happen', 'disagree', 'future', 'capitalism', 'will', 'lead', 'widening', 'rift', 'upper', 'lower', 'class', 'are', 'going', 'find', 'film', 'highly', 'unpalatable', 'Elysium', 'point', 'home', 'capital', 'E', 'are', 'willing', 'entertain', 'idea', 'increase', 'have', 'nots', 'trend', 'Elysium', 'here', 'tell', '2154', 'Earth', 'going', 'turn', 'toilet.Our', 'protagonist', 'Max', 'Da', 'Costa', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'man', 'difficult', 'past', 'trying', 'make', 'good', 'following', 'rules', 'Well', 'almost', 'still', 'wise', 'ass', 'particularly', 'when', 'being', 'interrogated', 'robots', 'enforce', 'law', 'world', 'teeming', 'crowded', 'humanity', 'see', 'what', 'Da', 'Costa', 'living', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'same', 'robots', 'oppress', 'mouthing', 'off', 'bot', 'getting', 'arm', 'broken', 'Da', 'Costa', 'paths', 'old', 'childhood', 'flame', 'Frey', 'Alice', 'Braga', 'Frey', 'daughter', 'Matilda', 'dying', 'leukemia', 'not', 'enough', 'motivate', 'Da', 'Costa', 'risk', 'life', 'save', 'salvation', 'Stanford', 'torus', 'known', 'Elysium', 'where', 'rich', 'live', 'robot', 'servants', 'cure-all', 'medbays', 'fix', 'conceivable', 'ill.A', 'word', 'Elysium', 'Greek', 'myth', 'afterlife', 'demigods', 'heroes', 'Pindar', 'Odes', 'good', 'receive', 'life', 'free', 'toil', 'not', 'scraping', 'strength', 'arms', 'earth', 'water', 'sea', 'sake', 'poor', 'sustenance', 'presence', 'honored', 'gods', 'who', 'gladly', 'kept', 'oaths', 'enjoy', 'life', 'tears', 'others', 'undergo', 'toil', 'unbearable', 'look', 'at.The', 'toil', 'unbearable', 'look', 'Earth', 'Da', 'Costa', 'irradiated', 'blatant', 'EHS', 'violation', ""'ll"", 'be', 'dead', 'five', 'days', 'nothing', 'lose', 'former', 'criminal', 'employer', 'Spider', 'Wagner', 'Moura', 'near', 'unintelligible', 'gangster', 'big', 'plans', 'regularly', 'desperate', 'Elysium', 'get', 'chance', 'healing', 'Da', 'Costa', 'bigger', 'plans', 'kidnapping', 'executive', 'Da', 'Costa', 'one', 'condition', 'go', 'CEO', 'company', 'where', 'Da', 'Costa', 'was', 'irradiated', 'CEO', 'John', 'Carlyle', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'catch', 'Carlyle', 'midst', 'coup', 'Elysium', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'Jessica', 'Delacourt', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'sporting', 'odd', 'French', 'accent', 'When', 'Da', 'Costa', 'Carlyle', 'downloads', 'brain', 'up', 'more', 'bargained', 'thus', 'cat-and-mouse', 'game', 'Da', 'Costa', 'sleeper', 'agent', 'Kruger', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'nearly', 'unintelligible', 'accent', 'Kruger', 'chasing', 'Da', 'Costa', 'Da', 'Costa', 'chasing', 'dream', 'saddled', 'guilt', 'love', 'life', 'daughter', 'will', 'die', 'soon', ""n't"", 'do', 'something.And', 'oh', 'yeah', 'Da', 'Costa', 'exoskeleton', 'Christ-like', 'allegories', 'squint', 'Damon', 'when', 'arms', 'ensues', 'lot', 'shaky-cam', 'combat', 'director', 'Neill', 'Blomkamp', 'trademark', 'dirty', 'sci-fi', 'universe', 'same', 'backdrop', 'was', 'so', 'effective', 'District', '9', 'ugly', 'war', 'ugly', 'place', 'Elysium', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'nice', 'things', 'say', 'about', 'just', 'everyone', 'involved', 'what', 'so', 'compelling', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'Yes', 'often', 'logic', 'leaps', 'scenes', 'transition', 'scenes', 'sets', 'be', 'so', 'tenuous', 'be', 'nearly', 'ethereal', 'message', 'movie', 'interesting', 'tale', 'tell', ""'re"", 'willing', 'listen', 'cybernetics', 'gunfights', 'not', 'withstanding']",N/A

1555333,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B008JFUN50,mitchell5954,"[2, 4]","Elysium is a decent movie, but it could have been much better.  Elysium is directed by Neill Blomkamp, the same person who directed District 9.  I personally thought that Elysium was a bit of a step down from District 9.  It has great effects, good action, and a great main villain.  However, the characters besides the villain I thought were a bit bland and the acting felt phoned in sometimes.  Plus I did not find the film very enjoyable, at least until the final act.The effects for the film are great.  The effects here are on par with District 9.  The film has a very similar look to it as District 9, which is not surprising since it is the same director.  I like all the technology employed here.  The action scenes are good particularly the fight between Matt Damon&#8217;s character and the villain played by Sharlto Copley.  The score was decent as well.The villain, Kruger, is a great villain.  Sharlto Copley proves that he has great range as an actor.  He seemed like one of the only characters that had any energy or passion.  He is definitely the best part of the film.However, the film has many issues.  The main characters, sad to say, were not very memorable.  Matt Damon is okay in the role.  However, the problem is that he is just okay.  There is nothing that stands out in his performance, and there is no energy to it a lot of the time.  I think that anybody could have played Damon&#8217;s role.  His character is more realistic and I did buy his plight, but I just did not find him very engaging.  Alice Braga and the little girl were quite bland as well.Jody Foster plays the secondary villain of the movie.  Foster does fin performance wise but I found her character very one-dimensional.  She is even a very fun villain like Copley is in this.  William Fichtner is also in the film.  However, he really has a nothing role and his character gets killed halfway through the film.  He is basically just a plot device.  Any actor could have that role.Another big issue I have with the film is the obvious message.  This film tries to hammer home the message of &#8220;don&#8217;t pollute the environment.&#8221;  It is a good but, like with Avatar, we have seen this message being conveyed in tons of other movies.  I do not mind films having big messages, but I&#8217;d wish they would find a new way of telling it.  I&#8217;ve seen the same message conveyed better in films like Wall-E, which is very similar to Elysium.On top of all that the film is not that enjoyable to watch, in my opinion.  It is not a bad film.  It is actually a pretty decent movie.  However, it is not a film I would re-watch.  I have the same problem with District 9.  District 9 is a good movie, but it is not something I would watch again.  I think it mostly has to do with the look of the look of both films.  Both movies have a very bleak and dirty look to them.  The world that is depicted in these two films is not very fun to look at.  I understand that that was the point, but I still do not care for the look of these films.  It is too depressing for my taste.Overall, Elysium is a decent film and is worth at least one viewing.  I also think it is worth seeing in theatres if you have the chance, but I would see at matinee price.",3,A Step Down From District 9!,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,3243,"['Elysium', 'decent', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'Elysium', 'directed', 'Neill', 'Blomkamp', 'same', 'person', 'who', 'directed', 'District', '9', 'personally', 'thought', 'Elysium', 'was', 'bit', 'step', 'down', 'District', '9', 'great', 'effects', 'good', 'action', 'great', 'main', 'villain', 'However', 'characters', 'villain', 'thought', 'were', 'bit', 'bland', 'acting', 'felt', 'phoned', 'sometimes', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'film', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'least', 'final', 'act.The', 'effects', 'film', 'are', 'great', 'effects', 'here', 'are', 'par', 'District', '9', 'film', 'very', 'similar', 'look', 'District', '9', 'not', 'surprising', 'same', 'director', 'technology', 'employed', 'here', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'good', 'particularly', 'fight', 'Matt', 'Damon', '8217', 'character', 'villain', 'played', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'score', 'was', 'decent', 'well.The', 'villain', 'Kruger', 'great', 'villain', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'great', 'range', 'actor', 'seemed', 'one', 'only', 'characters', 'had', 'energy', 'passion', 'definitely', 'best', 'part', 'film.However', 'film', 'many', 'issues', 'main', 'characters', 'sad', 'say', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'memorable', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'okay', 'role', 'However', 'problem', 'just', 'okay', 'nothing', 'out', 'performance', 'energy', 'lot', 'time', 'think', 'anybody', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'Damon', '8217', 's', 'role', 'character', 'more', 'realistic', 'did', 'buy', 'plight', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'very', 'engaging', 'Alice', 'Braga', 'little', 'girl', 'were', 'quite', 'bland', 'well.Jody', 'Foster', 'secondary', 'villain', 'movie', 'Foster', 'fin', 'performance', 'wise', 'found', 'character', 'very', 'one-dimensional', 'even', 'very', 'fun', 'villain', 'Copley', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'also', 'film', 'However', 'really', 'nothing', 'role', 'character', 'killed', 'halfway', 'film', 'basically', 'just', 'plot', 'device', 'actor', 'could', 'have', 'role.Another', 'big', 'issue', 'have', 'film', 'obvious', 'message', 'film', 'hammer', 'home', 'message', '8220', 'don', '8217', 'pollute', 'environment.', '8221', 'good', 'Avatar', 'have', 'seen', 'message', 'being', 'conveyed', 'tons', 'other', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'mind', 'films', 'having', 'big', 'messages', '8217', 'would', 'find', 'new', 'way', 'telling', '8217', 'seen', 'same', 'message', 'conveyed', 'better', 'films', 'Wall-E', 'very', 'similar', 'Elysium.On', 'top', 'film', 'not', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'opinion', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'movie', 'However', 'not', 'film', 'would', 're-watch', 'have', 'same', 'problem', 'District', '9', 'District', '9', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'something', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'think', 'mostly', 'do', 'look', 'look', 'films', 'movies', 'have', 'very', 'bleak', 'dirty', 'look', 'world', 'depicted', 'two', 'films', 'not', 'very', 'fun', 'look', 'understand', 'was', 'point', 'still', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'look', 'films', 'too', 'depressing', 'taste.Overall', 'Elysium', 'decent', 'film', 'worth', 'least', 'one', 'viewing', 'also', 'think', 'worth', 'seeing', 'theatres', 'have', 'chance', 'would', 'see', 'matinee', 'price']",N/A

Nothing is wrong with this movie from a technical standpoint.  I just felt like he tried a little too hard to make the anti-blockbuster blockbuster...if you get my drift.  Not a huge fan of the message in this film either.  Trying a little too hard to paint corporations as the devil and don't even get me started on this whole healthcare commentary.  I promise that on an overall, that is not something that made me deduct stars though.  The real problem is this movie could've used to have a lot more action.  I am all for character development etc., but I am starting to feel like maybe Neill needs to stick to just directing his movies and not worry so much about the writing.  I like his technical skill, but he is trying too hard in my opinion with his writing.  Also, Jodie Foster sucks in this movie.  Like completely.

It is an added bonus when the movie isn't a sequel, a spin off or anything with the words ""trans"" in front of it.  Director and writer Neill Blomkamp surprised Hollywood and the public with his 2009 masterpiece, ""District 9"" and after a well-earned hiatus gives us this follow-up.In the year 2154 the world has evolved into the haves and the have-nots.  The privileged and wealthy now live on a giant man-made space station orbiting Earth.  There is no poverty, no disease, no crime and life is good.  Each home comes equipped with a machine that cures any ailment including those still fatal on Earth.  Earth, or at least Los Angeles - it is the only place depicted - has devolved into a cesspool of poverty and lawlessness.  The planet is in ruins, but people still strive to survive and hope one day to make it to Elysium, the name for the space station.Max (Matt Damon) is just a regular guy and one of the lucky ones to have a job.  He makes the military robots that keep order on Earth for the Elysium politicians.  Max (Mad?) is accidentally exposed to a lethal dose of radiation and given 5 days to live.  Desperate, he accepts an offer from one of his old criminal allies named Spider (Wagner Moura) that will get him to Elysium for a cure.  After a grueling medical/mechanical operation, Max is equipped with an exoskeleton and brain implant that increases his physical strength and hopefully will allow him to download a station reboot program from the top programmer.  Don't ask.The program is meant for the evil secretary of defense, Delacourt (Jodie Foster).  Much has been made of Foster's accent which appears to be part French and part South African, but who cares.  Its 141 years in the future.  In L. A. they're speaking a combination of Spanish and English.  Let's move on.  Getting in Max's way is a henchman of Delacourt played by Blomkamp's buddy and the star of ""District 9"", Sharlto Copley.While ""Elysium"" falls short of ""District 9,"" the flaws are not fatal.  Still, it would be interesting to know if all the other major cities/countries are like L. A. I also wondered how the world got to where they are today.  The film is beautifully shot with some chuckle-worthy product placements.  The wealthy program writer (William Fichtner) is transported between worlds in his black and red Bugatti space buggy.  Secretary Delacourt sports a nifty Bvlgary watch.  If anything Blomkamp is even more in-your-face with his politics.  While ""District 9"" was certainly an unveiled parable of apartheid, ""Elysium"" takes a broader stab at privilege with health care concerns a critical plot element.  ""Elysium"" is a good looking movie that moves right along with some cool action sequences.",4,A fine follow-up for Neill Blomkamp,1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,2829,"['may', 'be', 'spoilers.Admittedly', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'much', 'sucker', 'anything', 'sci-fi', 'especially', 'when', 'something', 'story', 'added', 'bonus', 'when', 'movie', ""n't"", 'sequel', 'spin', 'off', 'anything', 'words', 'trans', 'front', 'Director', 'writer', 'Neill', 'Blomkamp', 'surprised', 'Hollywood', 'public', '2009', 'masterpiece', 'District', '9', 'well-earned', 'hiatus', 'follow-up.In', 'year', '2154', 'world', 'evolved', 'haves', 'have-nots', 'privileged', 'wealthy', 'now', 'live', 'giant', 'man-made', 'space', 'station', 'orbiting', 'Earth', 'poverty', 'disease', 'crime', 'life', 'good', 'home', 'equipped', 'machine', 'ailment', 'including', 'still', 'fatal', 'Earth', 'Earth', 'least', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'only', 'place', 'depicted', 'devolved', 'cesspool', 'poverty', 'lawlessness', 'planet', 'ruins', 'people', 'still', 'strive', 'survive', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'make', 'Elysium', 'name', 'space', 'station.Max', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'just', 'regular', 'guy', 'one', 'lucky', 'ones', 'have', 'job', 'military', 'robots', 'keep', 'order', 'Earth', 'Elysium', 'politicians', 'Max', 'Mad', 'accidentally', 'exposed', 'lethal', 'dose', 'radiation', 'given', '5', 'days', 'live', 'Desperate', 'offer', 'one', 'old', 'criminal', 'allies', 'named', 'Spider', 'Wagner', 'Moura', 'will', 'get', 'Elysium', 'cure', 'grueling', 'medical/mechanical', 'operation', 'Max', 'equipped', 'exoskeleton', 'brain', 'implant', 'physical', 'strength', 'hopefully', 'will', 'allow', 'download', 'station', 'reboot', 'program', 'top', 'programmer', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask.The', 'program', 'meant', 'evil', 'secretary', 'defense', 'Delacourt', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Much', 'been', 'made', 'Foster', 'accent', 'be', 'part', 'French', 'part', 'South', 'African', 'who', '141', 'years', 'future', 'L.', 'A.', ""'re"", 'speaking', 'combination', 'Spanish', 'English', 'Let', 'move', 'Getting', 'Max', 'way', 'henchman', 'Delacourt', 'played', 'Blomkamp', 'buddy', 'star', 'District', '9', 'Sharlto', 'Copley.While', 'Elysium', 'short', 'District', '9', 'flaws', 'are', 'not', 'fatal', 'Still', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'know', 'other', 'major', 'cities/countries', 'are', 'L.', 'A.', 'also', 'wondered', 'how', 'world', 'got', 'where', 'are', 'today', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'chuckle-worthy', 'product', 'placements', 'wealthy', 'program', 'writer', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'transported', 'worlds', 'black', 'red', 'Bugatti', 'space', 'buggy', 'Secretary', 'Delacourt', 'sports', 'nifty', 'Bvlgary', 'watch', 'anything', 'Blomkamp', 'even', 'more', 'in-your-face', 'politics', 'District', '9', 'was', 'certainly', 'unveiled', 'parable', 'apartheid', 'Elysium', 'broader', 'stab', 'privilege', 'health', 'care', 'critical', 'plot', 'element', 'Elysium', 'good', 'looking', 'movie', 'right', 'cool', 'action', 'sequences']",N/A

But the very long second act all but falls apart completely.  You just want to take all the brilliant footage they shoot and re edit it into something truly meaningful .My guess is most people who hated this film gave up on this movie around one hour in, when it seemed like the story had run its course and the dialogue is beyond terrible. But for those who stuck it out to the end it was a good payoff. However, I don't blame those who gave up.

In Alysium's future we have cures for all kinds of cancers but we keep them only for the super rich because aparently the rich will have done away with insurance companies. Therefore the poor, which make up the entire working-class of gardeners, cabdrivers, babysitters, cleaning people, teachers, etc., etc. all suffer and die at a very young age and at a very rapid rate.How in the world does this support ANY political agenda?I give it three stars for its stunning visual effects and production design.

1555366,A237RLQXTL55RG,B008JFUN50,off the tropic,"[15, 23]","Neil Blomkamp's second feature film, Elysium, is not as good as District 9, his prodigious 2009 feature film debut. That first Blomkamp movie was a miracle film - brilliant in its vision and as emotionally powerful and gripping as the greatest Dystopian science fiction film of all time - Bladerunner.Even if Elysium does not measure up well with the high standards of its classic predecessor,this is hardly a reason not to see Blomkamp's unique vision of the future take on a wider scale. We continue to witness a young director map out his unique vision on a much larger canvas. His talent for creating new worlds and invoking a mood to match the scale, is all well worth seeing again.Elysium is a fable of a world gone horribly wrong. Social ills have reached a terrifying level of mismanagement and neglect in the year 2154. The divide between the rich and poor has become massive and unbridgeable. The vast differences have set the privileged few to abandon their planet and flee from the languishing poor to create a wealthy, secluded, spotless off-world space colony in orbit far above and away from the social chaos of the withering world they have left behind.The off-world enclave for the rich, aptly named ""Elysium"", is built to be a paradise of tranquility and its spotless world is much like the afterlife wished for and imagined by the ancient Greeks. This is a world replete with comfort and security with technological toys catered to keep the physical and mental well-being of Elysium's creators - the elite rich - in perfect condition, free of pain, death and disease. Every home has a miracle machine programmed to heal the human body at any stage of deterioration. There is a settled peace on Elysium with crime non-existent, the life of leisure constant, and the inhabitants humming in perfect health.But the surface ease and tranquility of its inhabitants barely hides the systematic hatred and exclusion they have encouraged. The contrast of this world of brightness, clean air, perfect health, and safety with a world plunged in disease and turmoil on earth below is a telling one. This setting of contrasts, so much a part of the aesthetic of District 9 reaches a bigger scale here in Elysium and magnifies the sense of rebellion in the dying world below.Matt Damon plays Max, one of the abandoned poor who longs to escape his plight on earth. Max, like many others, pines for Elysium; as a child, he has looked up longingly to this world of dreams. He has learned to talk of it as if it was the afterlife, after a trying existence on earth. But the defense of this glistening abode of the rich is callously overseen by Delacourt, well played by Jodie Foster in an uncharacteristically villainous turn as the secretary of defense at Elysium. Max works as an assembly line worker in a factory that manufactures and sends out robots as a first line of defense against the likes of him. After Max is forced to confront his own mortality his sole aim becomes to plan a rebel invasion to tap into the vast medical resources of Elysium. The cure for his rapidly failing health becomes his driving ambition. But Delacourt tries to put a stop to this. She does this with brutal and unthinking efficiency. Sharlto Copley, Director Neil Blomkamp's lead star in District 9, as Kruger, in another great performance, is the one man demolition squad for Delacourt. As her foot-soldier who will stop at nothing to carry out her orders, Kruger does his bit to resist the efforts of Max and his team of rebels.Elysium proves that Matt Damon's success as an action star, since the Bourne series, is no fluke. He continues to show that he can do the action star bit convincingly. Damon is getting better at his craft and he has that unique quality to convincingly take on the role of an ordinary guy who takes on an extraordinary role when he is forced to lead.Blomkamp revives themes from District 9 - the rich against the poor, the marginalized world of slums set against the world of the privileged, that drives the apocalyptic theme envisioned here. The drama of the desperation of the poor foregrounded here is a reminder of the world imagined in District 9. This story sets up a similar need of a Herculean Christ-like figure, reviled and marginalized through most of the narrative. This is precisely a world that demands heroes and the story and characters are set up to answer this need.But the emotional weight disappears gradually and the story of love and sacrifice lapses into melodrama. The directorial choices made here do not map out well and characters brimming with potential are drowned by the scale of the spectacle (the special effects are as awe inspiring as any sci-fi film this year). The human dimension of the story rapidly evaporates and the script veers gradually into cliche. The tragic sense that lay at the heart of the art of Blomkamp's District 9 is diluted as the plot gains momentum. As we reach the denouement, the director seems to let the tragic tension that he so artfully engaged with in his first film languish in some crucial moments.As a science fiction, action film, Elysium is great entertainment but only if you come in determined to forget that this is directed by that prodigy who created District 9. But if you see Elysium for what it is - an action film and a great Friday night at the movies - with reliable performances from Damon, Copley, and an inspired supporting cast, and as a wonderful journey to another meticulously crafted world by Blomkamp, this is a spectacle you will not want to miss. This is another science fiction film worth embracing despite its flaws. As such it belongs to that category of films with set-pieces and production values that are nothing short of astonishing  - like Oblivion and Prometheus - but with stories that lose steam precisely at those  moments we expected so much more from its distinguished directors.",4,Elysium,1383955200,"11 9, 2013",2013,5901,"['Neil', 'Blomkamp', 'second', 'feature', 'film', 'Elysium', 'not', 'as',

1555378,A11TUHEHHENLBC,B008JFUN50,"Patrick L. Boyle ""Mr. Wonderful""","[0, 0]","Matt Damon rose to stardom by playing a genius. But he's more of an idiot - as least in terms of career management.Damon is not tall - but he's not ridiculously short like some other Hollywood action stars. He not particularly handsome as movie stars go - but he's perfectly acceptable. He seems, like Stallone, to be a talented scriptwriter and that's how he got his first big break. He's a decent actor - unlike his buddy Ben Affleck. He's an everyman not a glamor man. In the Ocean's eleven-through-thirteen series he's distinctly less glittering than the main leads.His second big break was the Bourne series. That surprised me. The books were terrible but the movies were much, much better. Any number of young movie stars could have gotten that part but they didn't - Damon did. He was well cast. Sean Connery was always ridiculous cast as an undercover spy. Everyone would remember that tall and incredibly handsome guy. Damon could actually not be noticed on a public street. He's much more average.So what's my point? Damon is being replaced by Jeremy Renner - an even more average guy. He's shorter and less handsome than Damon. But I like him better - mostly because I don't know anything about his politics. When I see on the screen I am not distracted by what I know of him in real life.But with Damon I am confronted with memories of all his public posturing on political issues. Damon politically doesn't have anything original to say. He doesn't seem all that bright. He is merely trading on his fame - and it's costing him.Damon's high political profile is particularly obtrusive in this hard left political movie. The plot is a loony left wing fantasy.  The main issues in the future seem to be the same issues that the left thinks are important in Obama's second term. The main theme is income distribution. Somehow the rich people are all living happy in orbit while they have oppressed most people so that they have to live in earthbound squalor.Why would they do this? Every society on earth strives to enrich the poor but for some reason in the future that's all reversed and the orbiteers enjoy making everyone else poor. The other question is why don't the people of earth just create some wealth for themselves? The Earth in this movie looks like a huge horizon to horizon South American slum. Where is Hong Kong, or Abu Dhabi?  Before the opening credits it is explained that overpopulation is a problem. If so why don't they trim the population?  They have a lot of advanced technology but that idea has never occurred to them.The technology in the movie is annoying. They keep showing normal chemical rockets flying in one stage into orbit. They even have shoulder fired missiles that break free of the Earth's gravity and reach orbit in seconds. Maybe when Obama killed NASA the people forgot what real space technology was like.The people on the earth in this film are like the people in the Matrix underground cave - scruffy and dirty. They all look like they need a bath but they seem to be able to run a major high tech operation with no problems. This is apparently a new meme.

This is a gorgeous, relevant science fiction film from Neill Blomkamp, the guy that made &#8220;District 9&#8221;.2. It&#8217;s set in the year 2154, when all the rich people have moved off Earth to an orbiting space station called Elysium. Matt Damon stars as an ex-con car car thief on Earth, living in the slums of LA.3. Jodie Foster plays the secretary of defense of Elysium. Her main job seems to be to get rid of illegal immigrants that try to force their way into the rich world.4. After an industrial accident infects Matt Damon with lethal radiation, he joins forces with a group of hackers trying to steal valuable financial information.5. I always admire actors that aren&#8217;t afraid to look like s***. Damon spends most of the movie dying from radiation poisoning and getting beat up. He does well. On the other end of the appearance spectrum, Foster is excellent as the fashionable, icy bitch that really runs Elysium. The way she enunciates words is so startlingly cultured that I had trouble paying attention to anything else when she talked.6. Blomkamp seems to be obsessed with slums and favelas; this movie has a very similar look and feel to &#8220;District 9&#8221;. It could easily be occurring in the same world.7. The lead role was first offered to a South African rapper named Ninja, but he didn&#8217;t want it. Then it was offered to Eminem. But Eminem wanted to film the movie in Detroit, and Hollywood said no. So it was given to Damon.8. There are definitely a few plot holes, but they don&#8217;t take from the overarching story. The pacing and look of the film help distract you from paying too much attention to the problems.9. It&#8217;s not a particularly original film. It&#8217;s about rich vs. poor, overpopulation, immigration, and the human condition. But the story is told well, the art design is delicious, and the acting is above average. Like Blomkamp&#8217;s first film, this is social commentary disguised as science fiction.",4,"great spiritual companion to ""District 9""",1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,2015,"['Nine', 'Things', '8220', 'Elysium', '8221', '1', 'gorgeous', 'relevant', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'Neill', 'Blomkamp', 'guy', 'made', '8220', 'District', '9', '8221', '8217', 's', 'set', 'year', '2154', 'when', 'rich', 'people', 'have', 'moved', 'off', 'Earth', 'orbiting', 'space', 'station', 'called', 'Elysium', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'ex-con', 'car', 'car', 'thief', 'Earth', 'living', 'slums', 'LA.3', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'secretary', 'defense', 'Elysium', 'main', 'job', 'be', 'get', 'rid', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'try', 'force', 'way', 'rich', 'world.4', 'industrial', 'accident', 'infects', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'lethal', 'radiation', 'forces', 'group', 'hackers', 'trying', 'steal', 'valuable', 'financial', 'information.5', 'always', 'admire', 'actors', 'aren', '8217', 'afraid', 'look', 's***', 'Damon', 'most', 'movie', 'dying', 'radiation', 'poisoning', 'getting', 'beat', 'up', 'well', 'other', 'end', 'appearance', 'spectrum', 'Foster', 'excellent', 'fashionable', 'icy', 'bitch', 'really', 'Elysium', 'way', 'words', 'so', 'startlingly', 'cultured', 'had', 'trouble', 'paying', 'attention', 'anything', 'else', 'when', 'talked.6', 'Blomkamp', 'be', 'obsessed', 'slums', 'favelas', 'movie', 'very', 'similar', 'look', 'feel', '8220', 'District', '9', '8221', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'occurring', 'same', 'world.7', 'lead', 'role', 'was', 'first', 'offered', 'South', 'African', 'rapper', 'named', 'Ninja', '8217', 'want', 'Then', 'was', 'offered', 'Eminem', 'Eminem', 'wanted', 'film', 'movie', 'Detroit', 'Hollywood', 'said', 'was', 'given', 'Damon.8', 'are', 'definitely', 'few', 'plot', 'holes', 'don', '8217', 't', 'take', 'overarching', 'story', 'pacing', 'look', 'film', 'help', 'distract', 'paying', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'problems.9', '8217', 'not', 'particularly', 'original', 'film', '8217', 's', 'rich', 'vs.', 'poor', 'overpopulation', 'immigration', 'human', 'condition', 'story', 'told', 'well', 'art', 'design', 'delicious', 'acting', 'above', 'average', 'Blomkamp', '8217', 'first', 'film', 'social', 'commentary', 'disguised', 'science', 'fiction']",N/A

Sometimes in real life people work there way into upper society by hard work and being more intelligent, but many times people that end up there do so by having advantages that others from middle class or working class backgrounds don't have, and in some cases those elitists end up there because they have taken advantage of, swindled, and cheated others.

1555396,A3TD7HLTDWZ382,B008JFUN50,"Pikminfan ""bobsworld3""","[14, 25]","Fans of science fiction have been graced these past few years.  At a time when most of us have been too preoccupied with comic book heroes to notice-science fiction has made a stealthy but definitive comeback.  It wasn't giant sagas like Star Wars that kick started the resurgence either, instead it seems to have been brought on by smart, well written smaller budget or independent films.  As a long time science fiction fan, I welcome its return to relevance.I mention ""District 9"" in this review not only because it shares the same director-but also because I credit D9 as the beginning of the Sci-fi comeback.  With District 9, Neill Blomkamp gave us a wholy original, intelligent take on the genre and showed us something we hadn't seen before.  Subsequent small films like ""Moon"", ""Monsters"" and even ""Attack The Block"" (among others) solidified science fiction's triumphant return.  And though there has been a wealth of smaller quality Science Fiction films It didn't hurt that the big boys like the Star Trek Reboot films, Pacific Rim, Prometheus & the remakes of Total Recall and Dredd were also a return to form.Elysium gloriously keeps the resurgence going.  Though it shares a great deal of DNA with its older brother District 9-Eylsium benefits from a bigger budget.  Thankfully, that bigger budget always serves to ADD to the story rather than to detract from it and the film as a whole is a truly enjoyable experience from start to finish.  There's something about Blomkamp's directing (I can't quite put my finger on it) that gives his films a sense of gritty realism.  Though what you're seeing on the screen is make believe, it seems fully plausible and real, as if it really is happening right before your eyes.  I was in awe during several scenes of the film even though there were no giant space battles or marching enemy armies or anything even resembling such in sight.  There is just a sense of wonder and awe present throughout the film and it's all in the way the director presents the material.  This was true for District 9 as well but its even more evident in Elysium.  I'm not going to go into plot details or anything like that in this review-I really just wanted to say what a breath of fresh air it was to experience something so new amidst the summer bloat-buster season (Hey, I like the big budget stuff as well as the next guy-but there's still something to be said about story over explosions)I can't wait to see what Blomkamp has up his sleeve next.  I just hope it's another sci-fi gem like Elysium.  I could also see this guy becoming the next Guillermo Del Toro or Joss Whedon.  He's gonna do some big things in his career.",5,The resurgence of great sci-fi continues,1376179200,"08 11, 2013",2013,2665,"['Fans', 'science', 'fiction', 'have', 'been', 'graced', 'few', 'years', 'time', 'when', 'most', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'preoccupied', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'notice-science', 'fiction', 'made', 'stealthy', 'definitive', 'comeback', 'was', ""n't"", 'giant', 'sagas', 'Star', 'Wars', 'kick', 'started', 'resurgence', 'either', 'instead', 'have', 'been', 'brought', 'smart', 'well', 'written', 'smaller', 'budget', 'independent', 'films', 'long', 'time', 'science', 'fiction', 'fan', 'welcome', 'return', 'relevance.I', 'mention', 'District', '9', 'review', 'not', 'only', 'shares', 'same', 'director-but', 'also', 'credit', 'D9', 'beginning', 'Sci-fi', 'comeback', 'District', '9', 'Neill', 'Blomkamp', 'gave', 'wholy', 'original', 'intelligent', 'take', 'genre', 'showed', 'something', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'Subsequent', 'small', 'films', 'Moon', 'Monsters', 'even', 'Attack', 'Block', 'others', 'solidified', 'science', 'fiction', 'triumphant', 'return', 'been', 'wealth', 'smaller', 'quality', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'big', 'boys', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Reboot', 'films', 'Pacific', 'Rim', 'Prometheus', 'remakes', 'Total', 'Recall', 'Dredd', 'were', 'also', 'return', 'form.Elysium', 'gloriously', 'resurgence', 'going', 'shares', 'great', 'deal', 'DNA', 'older', 'brother', 'District', '9-Eylsium', 'benefits', 'bigger', 'budget', 'Thankfully', 'bigger', 'budget', 'always', 'ADD', 'story', 'rather', 'detract', 'film', 'whole', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'start', 'finish', 'something', 'Blomkamp', 'directing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'films', 'sense', 'gritty', 'realism', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'screen', 'make', 'believe', 'fully', 'plausible', 'real', 'really', 'happening', 'right', 'eyes', 'was', 'awe', 'several', 'scenes', 'film', 'even', 'were', 'giant', 'space', 'battles', 'marching', 'enemy', 'armies', 'anything', 'even', 'resembling', 'such', 'sight', 'just', 'sense', 'wonder', 'awe', 'present', 'film', 'way', 'director', 'material', 'was', 'true', 'District', '9', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'more', 'evident', 'Elysium', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'plot', 'details', 'anything', 'review-I', 'really', 'just', 'wanted', 'say', 'what', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'was', 'experience', 'something', 'so', 'new', 'amidst', 'summer', 'bloat-buster', 'season', 'Hey', 'like', 'big', 'budget', 'stuff', 'as', 'well', 'next', 'guy-but', 'still', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'story', 'explosions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'Blomkamp', 'up', 'sleeve', 'next', 'just', 'hope', 'sci-fi', 'gem', 'Elysium', 'could', 'also', 'see', 'guy', 'becoming', 'next', 'Guillermo', 'Del', 'Toro', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'gon', 'do', 'big', 'things', 'career']",N/A
1555397,A19VGK6V3FHHIO,B008JFUN50,"P. Lazaroff ""Book lover""","[0, 0]","Science fiction - be it movies, books, manuscripts, games, or just random thoughts, should have a very good understanding of science before the fiction is fully developed. As a writer I research material before inclusion, the same would-and should-go for movies. In this movie a band of thugs have the ability to put an exoskeleton on the hero, that connects to his nervous system directly. Once complete the hero is endowed with extra strength, though no additional intelligence or even common sense. Too bad, the decisions he makes are based on some very disturbing emotional ties made with a woman, (who else?), when he was a child. As a criminal in a world that makes dystopia  a word with all capital letters - bolded and underlined so the point isn't missed, there are just too many errors with the science to make the movie enjoyable as it might be done correctly. As a reader of all things science, I am updated on the exoskeletons DARPA among others, have worked on and are working on, for the battlefield and for those who suffer paralysis, either partial or total. Most allow for movement when a person cannot provide this on their own, but some do indeed allow a man to lift hundreds of pounds effortlessly. However, none of these &#34;iron-man suits&#34; connect to the nervous system at every point, from limb to brain, though a few do connect with the nerves in the stump of a lost limb for instance. For those who argue the science is secondary to the story line, I can only say those folks must watch a lot of 1930's to '50's movies - the science never mattered then, and the story line was secondary to the lighting effects! Matt Damon is good in the movie, supporting actors not even close, with the usual B-flick overacting at every corner. Spaceships are land vehicles that can fly since they all have rockets attached to them in one way or another. Coloration is wonderful though, giving a full star for that alone. Another star for Matt Damon's acting chops and the fact I liked his character - the every-man put into a position that only extraordinary courage and ability can overcome. Love interest aside, the female lead, is forgettable as last week's lunch at the kitchen counter, and it is to the credit of our hero she is remembered at all.  One star goes to the effects used with the exoskeleton, it is pretty cool and complicated enough to put aside the obvious faults, such as the vast, exposed body parts of the hero which cause him problems to no end. A review should be air and I gave a star for the effects, one for the hero, and another for the creation of a city that truly filled me with a desire to die LONG before it becomes reality. Two stars were lost for the lack of science adhesion, worn out story line (hero loves woman-woman rejects hero-hero gets woman), and the fact our unstoppable hero is the only one with any acting chops whatsoever. Enjoyable the second time around since the defects can be overlooked a lot easier. Three times is the charm.

Yet, I normally don't hate movies, but if &#34;Elysium&#34; were a person, I'd kick it in the shins until I ran out of breath.1. When Matt Damon became an action hero with &#34;Bourne&#34; his Matt Damon bland thing matched the robotic nature of the character.  But doing it here is???  It's like he's super-competent to match every situation, but with no explanation how.  Again, made sense in Bourne, makes NO SENSE AT ALL here.2. Somehow, everybody left on earth was Mexican?  Except for Matt?  Did the stork get lost on his way to the space station?3. If you have a budget of millions of dollars, hire a script doctor who can turn your &#34;Let's do this&#34; and &#34;I'm coming for you&#34; into something slightly less eye-rolling.SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT4. Matt's got a super-suit, and somehow this enables him to absorb all possible damage, and WILL himself to beat up on the professional bad guys5. Professional bad guys who are so over-the-top cartoon character evil bad guy that I had to check the credits for Jim Cameron.  I might have understood their motives, if I could understand their English.6. Jan Van Van de Boerhoeven or whatever the flip the guy's name is is obviously not a native speaker of the English lingo because he seemed to care carp-all for whether or not his blithering characters could be understood.  The crippled super hacker guy could have been speaking in tongues for all I know.  Many other characters were just as bad.  I would have enabled subtitles but I didn't think I was missing much.7.  Jodie Foster should easily earn a Razzie for her dog manure acting in this movie.  Has she always been this bad and we just never noticed?  Even she is trying to put on some sort of accent - so stilted that I was fully expecting her to turn out to be a robot.  When she wasn't, I deduced that she is just god awful in this kind of role.8.  So Matt's chica just happens to have a daughter with leukemia, who is about to die, but looks as healthy as a tri-athlete.  Plot contrivance theater, which just gets lost in a SEA of plot contrivances such as; they have insty-med-care but keep it from the earthlings because...they...don't...want earthlings...to...something?  It makes no sense.  And why build Elysium in space anyway, when it's obviously just the size of a few football fields?  Hawaii is overrun with tourists?  Brazil is full of giant spiders now?9. And they have the perfect space world, but didn't bother to put a roof on it so that anybody who can strap 2 fire extinguishers to an office chair and slap a fishbowl on their head can invade whenever they choose, except that evil Jodie Foster has hired a guy (whose most sinister aspect is that he doesn't condition his hair) to shoot them down, which the Elysiumers DON'T WANT HER TO DO for some reason but then seem unable to stop her by, oh, I don't know, FIRING HER?10. The plan to reboot the space station with code that looks like something punched into a 1950s main frame is just ridiculous.  When it reboots, you can program yourself to be president!  Because nobody will remember that you weren't president before!  Just like every time I reboot my computer at home I have to call a special number to be reminded where I live!  Like the guy from Memento.  And the whole reason she wants to be president is to shoot down illegal invaders which, I would think, would be the only reason you would live in flipping space in the first place.  But she's evil, cuz she's white as the witch of the north and the terrible invaders are crippled Mexicans.11. Which just makes me ask, is the insinuation here that earth is now equivalent to Mexico and Elysium is the US?  Because Jan Van Der Poopy really needs to visit Mexico if he thinks it is the hellhole he put on screen.  And what is it with dystopian directors and their need to cleanse the earth of all green things?  I don't know if any of these people have gone up in a tall building in a major city, because it will look like a forest.  People tend to like trees, even if they are dirt poor.  It's as if they watched the Lorax one too many times, or Silent Running.  Take good care of the forest Jodie.12. So you've got your bleeding heart liberal immigration message halfway down my throat, why not bang the whole thing down with another unsubtle subtext about health care.  Oh health care is so magic, if it were only free for all then little poor girls with leukemia could be instantly healed, get it?  But those big bad rich doctors just need to get paid for their time and training, probably so they can afford new dancing shoes to dance on the graves of all the poor people that they are letting die.  I get it now.  Doubly bad if you can't get health care AND you are an illegal immigrant.13. I've got the magic program to reboot the space station and then rewrite people's brains but I'm not going to burn it to a DVD or stick it on a USB flash drive.  No that would be too unsafe!  Somebody might steal it!  So I'll put it in my flipping HEAD such that now they'll only have to steal my HEAD!  So much safer!  Cuz I'm pretty confident that 2 robots can prevent that from happening.  Especially since there are no trees to hide under.14.  Oh the thing is scrambled, except for the terribly cliched SUPER HACKER who can look at 4 pages of the scrambled code and deduce that he can now make everybody on earth a citizen.  At least they didn't have the line &#34;It'll take me a couple of minutes to hack into the main frame!&#34;, but that's only probably because they forgot to put it in, or it's a deleted scene.15.  Evil beard man can be brought back from the dead somehow, and now he wants to be president, but he didn't think of that when he actually had the guy with the reboot program in his head because...I guess having your head rebuilt makes you evil?  It certainly makes you unable to beat up a guy in an inferior super-suit who has had NO combat training.16. Let's accentuate the innate goodness of the downtrodden by making sure the mother covers the body of the woman who recently wanted her shot into space without a suit.  See folks!  GOOD!Oh I could just go on and on.  The lame action, the needless Jesus allusion at the end, the fact again that now everybody is a citizen thanks to a few lines of code (guess nobody remembers who their neighbors were up on the space wheel - here's a hint, they were probably white!  evil and white, or does that go without saying?)  I'm sure Matt and Jodie only wanted to be involved in this gobbler because they thought they'd be making some sort of bold statement about setting the chickens free.  Just surprised Matt didn't get to make a pretentious speech about things worth living or dying for or some such nonsense - or maybe he did, and I just couldn't understand him, or my brain had started the process of shutting the memory of this plop out of my system - I hope it doesn't reboot, because then Jodie Foster will become president of my brain and force me to go pick up her Razzie for worst acting ever.",2,I Hope Somebody Liked This,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,7119,"['obviously', 'lot', 'money', 'took', 'lot', 'time', 'absorbed', 'lot', 'talent', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate',

The year is 2154 and Earth is overpopulated, diseaseridden and in disrepair. The world's wealthiest live in a fortifiedspace station above earth called Elysium. There they enjoy every luxuryincluding mechanisms that will cure them from almost, if not every,illness or injury. The people of Earth want to be there and the peopleof Elysium definitely do not want the Earth dwellers coming to theirabode.From the start of the movie I was thinking &#34;Dredd&#34; or even &#34;In Time&#34;with Justin Timberlake as the scenery and the plot reminded me of thosetwo films. Initially, I was wondering where the conflict would comefrom and what it would be. I mean, even today the wealthy live inbeautiful protected areas away from the general public and theytypically don't want strangers invading their neighborhoods. Is that sowrong?As the movie played out the conflict became clear. A movie needs oneprotagonist or more and one antagonist or more. It was clear who weresupposed to be the protagonists and who were supposed to be theantagonists, but the writers and/or director had to really cement thefact that the protagonists were on Earth and the antagonists were onElysium. So, in not so subtle fashion, they made the Elysium citizensdepraved and nearly inhuman in their behavior and mannerisms.Essentially you were supposed to loathe Elysium and all it stood for.I think it was a little over the top and a bit unnecessary. Yes,wealthy people are going to make decisions and do things to protecttheir wealth, but that's not to say that they have no moral fiberwhatsoever.Putting that aspect of the movie aside, it did make for a riveting filmafter all. Eventually I was drawn into the saga and I waswhole-heartedly pulling for the hero. There is a lot of symbolism andparallels in this movie to life as we know it now, some of them discreteand others are overtly obvious. The effects and graphics were a bigplus. The robot police and guards were extremely human-like in theirmovements such that you would think they were people in robot costumes.And graphical representation of Earth and Elysium made the disparitybetween the two locations very pronounced.

And the folks on earth constantly dream of saving up enough moolah to get up there.One day at work Damon gets exposed to a radiation overdose and he seeks the help of a man he used to work for to get him to Elysium where he can be saved.Meanwhile on Elysium,Foster the defense secretary,is having problems of her own.She has just shot down three shuttles from earth trying to land illegally and has killed a significant number of people in the process.The president is none too pleased and she is given a short leash.She hatches a scheme with the owner of the same company Damon works for.She gets him to produce a computer app that will rewrite the programming on Elysium and install her as the new president.Damon's old boss says the only way he will get him up to Elysium is if Damon can steal the new app his boss has made.They outfit Damon with an exo skeleton drilled right into his body.It will not only enhance his physical strength,but also comes with a brain implant which will allow Damon to store the app data in his brain for download later.As Damon's present boss prepares to leave earth,Damon and some selected assistants bring his shuttle down.They are working on short time as some clandestine hired hit men(working for Foster)are also tracking the shuttle.Damon gets the info he needs but all of his team are killed.Seriously wounded he heads to the home of an old girl friend who patches him up.He leaves soon after not wanting to endanger her or her daughter.Foster puts a transmission lock down over L.A. and sends her clandestine group after Damon.They eventually find him and he is brought aboard the shuttle,which later arrives on Elysium.His old girl friend and her daughter are also on board,being used as a bargaining chip.Damon plays along until the leader tries to over power him just before they land,resulting in the leader losing most of his face in a grenade blast.Damon's old flame spirits her daughter to a home,which has a medical unit which can reverse her deadly leukemia.During this commotion Damon's old boss has arrived on Elysium also,and meets up with Damon and examines the data.It turns out the data will make everyone on Earth a citizen of Elysium.While they fight their way to a main terminal,Foster has confronted her bag man over his incompetence.After having just reconstructed his face,he kills her and sets out to find and kill Damon.The battle eventually arrives,with Damon coming through in grand style.Damon and his old boss finally reach the terminal and Damon is plugged into it.The download will kill Damon but end Elysium's control over itself and its citizens.Damon pushes the button himself and the download begins.The Elysium computers having recognized Earth citizens as their own,now dispatch medical ships to Earth to heal the inhabitants there,in need.Damon of course is kaput-skied.As I said it is a meandering plot and Damon's&#34;acting&#34; does nothing for this reviewer at all.Quite vanilla actually.And the plot,well let's look at some &#34;issues&#34;I have with the story.What is with that space station?When we first see it,it looks like they reused the miniature from 2001 a Space Odyssey.Then there's Foster's accent.She goes in and out of it,whatever in the world&#34;it&#34; was! Then there is Damon's radiation overdose.The thing is to not make things so obvious,well,so obvious.There is a pallet obstructing a thick door from closing.In the little space open he tries unsuccessfully to kick it away.You know that if he goes inside the door will close behind him.What does his boss come along and tell him to do? Of course,go inside.And what does the door do?I think you know.And of course we must feel empathy for Damon,whose company treats their employees like crap.An old writing canard if there ever was one.Way too obvious and old hat.And in this film with such little depth,it stands out far too much.And finally(only because there is a limited space here)how in the heck did Damon's old boss get onto Elysium without being detected or attacked? At the beginning of the film we are given stark images of ships that try to illegally land being blown out of the sky.But not in this instance.I guess the writers REALLY needed him up there,whatever they had to do.Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include two featurettes.It tells you on the outside of the DVD case that if you want more extras,buy the Blu-Ray.We always have known the industry has always been constantly pushing the consumer in certain directions(from records,to tapes,to CDs,from VHS to DVD's now to Blu Ray).We got that same spiel when they were forcing us into DVD's from VHS tapes. So if you were ever wondering whether we're being manipulated,that kind of confirms it.All in all a lacklustre film with a lacklustre script.The plot has a lot of holes in it and Foster's attempt at some form of accent is hilarious.Damon is totally nondescript in his role;it could have been anyone(and anyone else may have done better!).",3,"Big on look,little of substance.",1388793600,"01 4,

1555438,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B008JFUN50,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","***1/2In the year 2154, the earth has become a veritable wasteland of poverty, pollution and overpopulation (what a surprise). The wealthy elite have long since fled to a paradisiacal spaceship named Elysium (after the section in the Greek underworld reserved exclusively for heroes and poets) permanently orbiting the planet, where they lead lives of pampered ease, leaving the great unwashed masses back home to fend for themselves. Some of those masses make occasional desperate stabs at reaching the ship, where they are captured and put into camps, if they're lucky, or blown to smithereens before being able to land if they're not. Matt Damon plays a Joe Blow schmuck who, after receiving a fatal dose of radiation on the job, agrees to get in with a pretty bad crowd in order to get to Elysium to get a cure (the wealthy have all the medicines while the poor are left on Earth to sicken and die).A post-apocalyptic tale for the Occupy generation, this allegory of class division and illegal immigration is the brainchild of Neill Blomkamp, the South African writer/director who gave us the surprise critical and commercial hit &#34;District 9&#34; in 2009.Unfortunately, in a number of respects, &#34;Elysium&#34; doesn't quite rise to the level of that earlier film. Damon's Max de Costa is such a dull Everyman character that he goes from relatable to boring in no time flat. And the story, though promising at first, quickly stalls out, as Max spends an inordinate amount of the movie's running time just trying to get up to Elysium - though, once he gets there, things do pick up considerably.Purse-lipped Jodi Foster hams it up as the cold-blooded defense secretary whose job it is to make sure that nothing or no one threatens the idyllic life in Elysium - a woman so evil and callous she makes Cruella Deville and the Wicked Witch of the West look like Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.Shortcomings aside, however, &#34;Elysium&#34; uses first-rate art direction and production design to create a compelling vision of the future. Its sociopolitical subtext also lends it a gravitas that the story itself could never have achieved on its own. Add to that a genuinely touching ending and you have a movie that fails to fulfill the promise laid out by &#34;District 9&#34; but which has virtues of its own to recommend it.",3,A sci-fi allegory for the Occupy generation,1389916800,"01 17, 2014",2014,2327,"['year', '2154', 'earth', 'become', 'veritable', 'wasteland', 'poverty', 'pollution', 'overpopulation', 'what', 'surprise', 'wealthy', 'elite', 'have', 'long', 'fled', 'paradisiacal', 'spaceship', 'named', 'Elysium', 'section', 'Greek', 'underworld', 'reserved', 'exclusively', 'heroes', 'poets', 'permanently', 'orbiting', 'planet', 'where', 'lead', 'lives', 'pampered', 'ease', 'leaving', 'great', 'unwashed', 'masses', 'back', 'home', 'fend', 'masses', 'make', 'occasional', 'desperate', 'stabs', 'reaching', 'ship', 'where', 'are', 'captured', 'put', 'camps', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'blown', 'smithereens', 'being', 'able', 'land', ""'re"", 'not', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Joe', 'Blow', 'schmuck', 'who', 'receiving', 'fatal', 'dose', 'radiation', 'job', 'get', 'pretty', 'bad', 'crowd', 'order', 'get', 'Elysium', 'get', 'cure', 'wealthy', 'have', 'medicines', 'poor', 'are', 'left', 'Earth', 'sicken', 'die', '.A', 'post-apocalyptic', 'tale', 'Occupy', 'generation', 'allegory', 'class', 'division', 'illegal', 'immigration', 'brainchild', 'Neill', 'Blomkamp', 'South', 'African', 'writer/director', 'who', 'gave', 'surprise', 'critical', 'commercial', 'hit', '34', 'District', '9', '34', '2009.Unfortunately', 'number', 'respects', '34', 'Elysium', '34', ""n't"", 'quite', 'rise', 'level', 'earlier', 'film', 'Damon', 'Max', 'de', 'Costa', 'such', 'dull', 'Everyman', 'character', 'relatable', 'boring', 'time', 'flat', 'story', 'promising', 'first', 'quickly', 'out', 'Max', 'inordinate', 'amount', 'movie', 'running', 'time', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'up', 'Elysium', 'once', 'there', 'things', 'do', 'pick', 'up', 'considerably.Purse-lipped', 'Jodi', 'Foster', 'hams', 'up', 'cold-blooded', 'defense', 'secretary', 'job', 'make', 'sure', 'nothing', 'one', 'idyllic', 'life', 'Elysium', 'woman', 'so', 'evil', 'callous', 'Cruella', 'Deville', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'look', 'Rebecca', 'Sunnybrook', 'Farm.Shortcomings', 'aside', 'however', '34', 'Elysium', '34', 'first-rate', 'art', 'direction', 'production', 'design', 'create', 'compelling', 'vision', 'future', 'sociopolitical', 'subtext', 'also', 'gravitas', 'story', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'achieved', 'own', 'Add', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'ending', 'have', 'movie', 'fulfill', 'promise', 'laid', 'out', '34', 'District', '9', '34', 'virtues', 'own', 'recommend']",N/A

1555445,A3VNYMNK7OC7CM,B008JFUN50,R. Sardrena,"[2, 4]","Elysium is the name for a wheel-shaped space station on which 22nd century rich people live in luxury.  Meanwhile, billions of teeming poor live lives of squalor on an ugly, dilapidated Earth.  This is the premise of the newest addition to the dystopian variety of science fiction films dating back to Planet of the Apes, Soylent Green, et cetera.The quality of the visuals is strong.  Admirers of the South African director's earlier District 9 will find much that is familiar in this film. The vast slums of Mexico City serve as the slums of future Los Angeles.  Inevitably, there is a South African flavor here; the film's thuggish hit man had a thick Afrikaner accent.  Jodie Foster, who plays the effete villain, seems to affect one as well; it's hard to tell, since her labored accent fades in and out.  The visuals for the space station are breathtaking, depending in part on legendary visualist Syd Mead's work.Unfortunately, there are problems.  The protagonist, played by Matt Damon, seems like the only Northern European American on Earth.  Since he is cast as the savior for the largely Hispanic proletariat, there is the sense that salvation must come from The White Guy - again.  It also doesn't feel right that none of the Earthbound poor give Damon's character a hard time because of his race.  It's obvious that one reason that the poor remain poor - and the middle class is becoming poor - is its penchant for turning against itself along racial and other factional lines.There is also the strong impression that the story is propelled by what film makers call a &#34;McGuffin:&#34; a piece of gee whiz technology that everybody must have.  In this case, it is a medical bed that can cure anything within seconds - from terminal illnesses to having one's head blasted to a shred of pulp by a hand grenade.  Its reference to the current health care debate is heavy handed, and the technology seems too advanced - even for 22nd century Earth.  Another bit of technology holds out the hope that if one plugs it in and turns it on, society's evils will be solved - a far too convenient plot device that trivializes the social problems of our time.A pulped head is but one example of the film's greatest flaw; excessive violence and gore.  There are many who would like to see this film for its social commentary, but will recoil at about the ten-minute mark due to its rising tide of aggression and bloodshed.  Foul language - almost compulsory for the under-thirty crowd, is also a big turn-off for the remaining clean-mouthed members of the audience.Though the cast is strong, none of the actors give their best effort here.  Jodie Foster hits the right emotional tone for her character, but has trouble with her accent.  Matt Damon's performance feels phoned in; his reactions to his terminal condition are as unconvincing as his ultimate self-sacrifice.  His version of the &#34;It's a far, far better thing I do than I have ever done before&#34; speech is unworthy of one tear.If I were to use another McGuffin - a time machine - to advise the director before he began his work, I would have advised him to avoid the trap of an easy (gadget-driven) solution.  Can you imagine an ending for Soylent Green in which a dying Charlton Heston croaked:  &#34;Soylent Green is people!  Wait... Hey, everybody, if I open this door with my magic key, there's a warehouse of decent food!&#34;  Add a string of ugly invectives and a few squibs and you have Elysium.",3,Distopian sci-fi film is merely O.K.,1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,3472,"['Elysium', 'name', 'wheel-shaped', 'space', 'station', '22nd', 'century', 'rich', 'people', 'live', 'luxury', 'Meanwhile', 'billions', 'teeming', 'poor', 'live', 'lives', 'squalor', 'ugly', 'dilapidated', 'Earth', 'premise', 'newest', 'addition', 'dystopian', 'variety', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'dating', 'back', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Soylent', 'Green', 'et', 'cetera.The', 'quality', 'visuals', 'strong', 'Admirers', 'South', 'African', 'director', 'earlier', 'District', '9', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'familiar', 'film', 'vast', 'slums', 'Mexico', 'City', 'serve', 'slums', 'future', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Inevitably', 'South', 'African', 'flavor', 'here', 'film', 'thuggish', 'hit', 'man', 'had', 'thick', 'Afrikaner', 'accent', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'who', 'effete', 'villain', 'affect', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'hard', 'tell', 'labored', 'accent', 'fades', 'visuals', 'space', 'station', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'depending', 'part', 'legendary', 'visualist', 'Syd', 'Mead', 'work.Unfortunately', 'are', 'problems', 'protagonist', 'played', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'only', 'Northern', 'European', 'American', 'Earth', 'cast', 'savior', 'largely', 'Hispanic', 'proletariat', 'sense', 'salvation', 'must', 'come', 'White', 'Guy', 'again', 'also', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'none', 'Earthbound', 'poor', 'give', 'Damon', 'character', 'hard', 'time', 'race', 'obvious', 'one', 'reason', 'poor', 'remain', 'poor', 'middle', 'class', 'becoming', 'poor', 'penchant', 'turning', 'racial', 'other', 'factional', 'lines.There', 'also', 'strong', 'impression', 'story', 'propelled', 'what', 'film', 'makers', 'call', '34', 'McGuffin', '34', 'piece', 'gee', 'whiz', 'technology', 'everybody', 'must', 'have', 'case', 'medical', 'bed', 'can', 'cure', 'anything', 'seconds', 'terminal', 'illnesses', 'having', 'one', 'head', 'blasted', 'shred', 'pulp', 'hand', 'grenade', 'reference', 'current', 'health', 'care', 'debate', 'heavy', 'handed', 'technology', 'too', 'advanced', 'even', '22nd', 'century', 'Earth', 'bit', 'technology', 'out', 'hope', 'one', 'plugs', 'society', 'evils', 'will', 'be', 'solved', 'far', 'too', 'convenient', 'plot', 'device', 'social', 'problems', 'time.A', 'pulped', 'head', 'one', 'example', 'film', 'greatest', 'flaw', 'excessive', 'violence', 'gore', 'are', 'many', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'film', 'social', 'commentary', 'will', 'recoil', 'ten-minute', 'mark', 'due', 'rising', 'tide', 'aggression', 'bloodshed', 'Foul', 'language', 'almost', 'compulsory', 'under-thirty', 'crowd', 'also', 'big', 'turn-off', 'remaining', 'clean-mouthed', 'members', 'cast', 'strong', 'none', 'actors', 'give', 'best', 'effort', 'here', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'right', 'emotional', 'tone', 'character', 'trouble', 'accent', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'performance', 'feels', 'phoned', 'reactions', 'terminal', 'condition', 'are', 'as', 'unconvincing', 'ultimate', 'self-sacrifice', 'version', '34', 'far', 'far', 'better', 'thing', 'do', 'have', 'ever', 'done', '34', 'speech', 'unworthy', 'one', 'tear.If', 'were', 'use', 'McGuffin', 'time', 'machine', 'advise', 'director', 'began', 'work', 'would', 'have', 'advised', 'avoid', 'trap', 'easy', 'gadget-driven', 'solution', 'Can', 'imagine', 'ending', 'Soylent', 'Green', 'dying', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'croaked', '34', 'Soylent', 'Green', 'people', 'Wait', 'Hey', 'everybody', 'open', 'door', 'magic', 'key', 'warehouse', 'decent', 'food', '34', 'Add', 'string', 'ugly', 'invectives', 'few', 'squibs', 'have', 'Elysium']",N/A

Well, pretty much everything and the responsibility has to be laid at the feet of Blomkamp who must wipe his shoes clean before being allowed to direct again. Anyone who can make Jodie Foster a shrill one note actor deserves an Academy UnAward for inept direction and possibly another one for script participation.Aside from some special effects (and some not so special- the long shots of space travel from earth to Elysium look like they haven't progressed much beyond 2001), there's not much to see here and nothing to learn. Mr. Blomkamp has definite ideas about immigration and the overall unfairness of the world (there's a new concept worth exploring) but seems unable to deliver his messages without teaching to the kid in the corner wearing the dunce hat.More troubling is an undercurrent of racism . Elysium seems to consist of white people with a Pakistani or Indian and the occasional black thrown in. Earth on the other hand is overpopulated with Hispanics and other non- lilywhite ethnics who, as one reviewer noted, can read laptop code faster than a computer chip, handle heavy weapons and still find time to get elaborate tattoos. Obviously all these people need is a chance, a magic all healing hospital bed and a white man to lead them. Enter Matt  Damon in the &#34;Dancing With Wolves&#34; role. If he's not quite believable and seems vaguely uncomfortable in the role, you can blame both the script and the direction. I never thought of him as an action hero until the Bourne movies but he pulled it off admirably. Here, he's unconvincing as a self absorbed anti-hero no matter how many mechanical implants he has embedded in his brain and nervous system. Unconvincing doesn't even describe what Jodie Foster is in this movie.She looks good and all positives end there.I was intrigued when I read that part of this movie was filmed in the sprawling garbage dump for Mexico City. A world unto itself, it has it's own population of people and animals who find housing, subsistence and labor on the crap that people throw away. You don't see much of that in the film. By the credits, you don't see much of anything worth remembering.We know that Mr. Blomkamp has a sense of justice. We know he has a sense of outrage. We know he has a heart.

Sadly, Jodie Foster's acting just wasn't that great in this movie, I don't know whether it was her trying to be up tight, or just her accent, but it rubbed me the wrong way.Overall this movie gets a 3.75/5 for me, mainly because of the action, Matt Damon (and a few other actors), the visuals, sound effects, and some of the plot was decent.

Although there is nothing as terribly stupid as the District 9 ""alien blood that can bond with human DNA ... and also power spaceships,"" Elysium is heavy handed allegory, amped up drama and dramatically ridiculous.Some of the ships and robots are great to look at---seeing Syd Mead's name in the credits was not a big surprise.Since the days of Hitchcock people seemed to have forgotten that the first and most important job of a director is not to come up with 'cool visuals,' but direct actors. Ergo, the title, 'director.'So congrats to Blomkamp for showing me the first truly terrible Jodie Foster performance. It's like he showed her a 1960s spider-man cartoon and said, 'like this but bigger.' And a lot of her work was dubbed for some reason, likely accent inconsistency (even though it's still inconsistent in the end product). And i am a HUGE William Fichtner fan, but this movie also showcases his career nadir. Sometimes he seems to be imitating Data from Star Trek, other times, sort of German. And Copley as the villain...well if there is a less menacing accent than this, i haven't heard it. And he is of course, way, way over the top as he was in District 9 (though he was decent in Europa Report). Damon is the only performer whose work is credible, probably because he's a big enough star to just say no if Blomkamp wants to turn him into a screaming cartoon.In terms of story, don't expect any science or anything other than good versus evil. Sadly, with rare exception, Hollywood science fiction movies are really just noisy action movies these days, and as a huge science fiction fan I know i'll rarely see any interesting scientific elements in these (though the movies of Duncan Jones and Kosinski do have some smart ideas and are the exceptions). So no, Elysium isn't sci-fi, but just heavy handed action movie allegory, more or less the same class warfare of District 9, so he's already retreading this theme. Then there is the would-be action centerpiece exo-skeletal suit, an idea that doesn't work at all, and isn't well sold visually. Really, as designed, this thing wouldn't work without tearing off fingers and smashing the limbs of its user, which is why most exo-skeletal designs are also armor that could shield a water-based lifeform. In any case, the actions scenes are so shaky and over cut, it's hard to see what's happening regardless. But I never had even a moment of thinking the thing actually functioned or would function.Blomkamp clearly has a political viewpoint---one that I have no issue with at all, except that it makes his writing too pedantic and monochromatic. A strong viewpoint does not make one a good writer. Writing rich people are bad and poor people are good is not dramatically compelling to watch, even if you actually believe things are that simple. Look at the success George RR Martin is having with complex characters...Blomkamp's writing seems like that of a child by comparison. That Elysium is self-important and humorless, doesn't help.And if Blomkamp (who clearly should not write his own movies) really understood science fiction the way actual science fiction writers do---guys like Greg Egan, JMS, Ted Chiang, Arthur C. Clarke, Greg Bear, M. John Harrison, Stephen Baxter, Larry Niven, etc.--- he would not have a future world technology where humans can be rebuilt at an atomic level in the same world as one in which robots fire guns and miss their targets. (!!!) Robots hitting their targets when they fire is near future and to some extent, current; rebuilding bodies at an atomic level (in less than a minute) is very, very, very far future, if ever.But like most Hollywood junk---and the similarly stupid, crazily overrated breakthrough success District 9--- Blomkamp is doing something that looks like science fiction, but isn't.",1,"Looks like science fiction, but isn't: Simple-minded, heavy handed and dramatically silly",1382745600,"10 26, 2013",2013,3991,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'extremely', 'overrated', 'District', '9', 'Elysium', 'lone', 'strength', 'convincing', 'special', 'effects', 'weaknesses', 'are', 'other', 'area', 'nothing', 'terribly', 'stupid', 'District', '9', 'alien', 'blood', 'can', 'bond', 'human', 'DNA', 'also', 'power', 'spaceships', 'Elysium', 'heavy', 'handed', 'allegory', 'amped', 'up', 'drama', 'dramatically', 'ridiculous.Some', 'ships', 'robots', 'are', 'great', 'look', '-seeing', 'Syd', 'Mead', 'name', 'credits', 'was', 'not', 'big', 'surprise.Since', 'days', 'Hitchcock', 'people', 'seemed', 'have', 'forgotten', 'first', 'most', 'important', 'job', 'director', 'not', 'come', 'up', ""'cool"", 'visuals', 'direct', 'actors', 'Ergo', 'title', ""'director"", 'congrats', 'Blomkamp', 'showing', 'first', 'truly', 'terrible', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'performance', 'showed', '1960s', 'spider-man', 'cartoon', 'said', 'bigger', 'lot', 'work', 'was', 'dubbed', 'reason', 'likely', 'accent', 'inconsistency', 'even', 'still', 'inconsistent', 'end', 'product', 'i', 'am', 'HUGE', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'fan', 'movie', 'also', 'career', 'nadir', 'Sometimes', 'be', 'imitating', 'Data', 'Star', 'Trek', 'other', 'times', 'sort', 'German', 'Copley', 'villain', 'well', 'less', 'menacing', 'accent', 'i', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'course', 'way', 'way', 'top', 'was', 'District', '9', 'was', 'decent', 'Europa', 'Report', 'Damon', 'only', 'performer', 'work', 'credible', 'probably', 'big', 'enough', 'star', 'just', 'say', 'no', 'Blomkamp', 'turn', 'screaming', 'cartoon.In', 'terms', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'science', 'anything', 'other', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'Sadly', 'rare', 'exception', 'Hollywood', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'noisy', 'action', 'movies', 'days', 'huge', 'science', 'fiction', 'fan', 'know', 'i', ""'ll"", 'rarely', 'see', 'interesting', 'scientific', 'elements', 'movies', 'Duncan', 'Jones', 'Kosinski', 'do', 'have', 'smart', 'ideas', 'are', 'exceptions', 'So', 'no', 'Elysium', ""n't"", 'sci-fi', 'just', 'heavy', 'handed', 'action', 'movie', 'allegory', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'class', 'warfare', 'District', '9', 'already', 'retreading', 'theme', 'Then', 'would-be', 'action', 'centerpiece', 'exo-skeletal', 'suit', 'idea', ""n't"", 'work', ""n't"", 'well', 'sold', 'visually', 'Really', 'designed', 'thing', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'tearing', 'off', 'fingers', 'smashing', 'limbs', 'user', 'why', 'most', 'exo-skeletal', 'designs', 'are', 'also', 'armor', 'could', 'shield', 'water-based', 'lifeform', 'case', 'actions', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'shaky', 'cut', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'happening', 'regardless', 'never', 'had', 'even', 'moment', 'thinking', 'thing', 'actually', 'functioned', 'would', 'function.Blomkamp', 'clearly', 'political', 'viewpoint', '-one', 'have', 'issue', 'writing', 'too', 'pedantic', 'monochromatic', 'strong', 'viewpoint', 'not', 'make', 'one', 'good', 'writer', 'Writing', 'rich', 'people', 'are', 'bad', 'poor', 'people', 'are', 'good', 'not', 'dramatically', 'compelling', 'watch', 'even', 'actually', 'believe', 'things', 'are', 'simple', 'Look', 'success', 'George', 'RR', 'Martin', 'having', 'complex', 'characters', 'Blomkamp', 'writing', 'child', 'comparison', 'Elysium', 'self-important', 'humorless', ""n't"", 'help.And', 'Blomkamp', 'who', 'clearly', 'should', 'not', 'write', 'own', 'movies', 'really', 'understood', 'science', 'fiction', 'way', 'actual', 'science', 'fiction', 'writers', 'do', '-guys', 'Greg', 'Egan', 'JMS', 'Ted', 'Chiang', 'Arthur', 'C.', 'Clarke', 'Greg', 'Bear', 'M.', 'John', 'Harrison', 'Stephen', 'Baxter', 'Larry', 'Niven', 'etc.', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'future', 'world', 'technology', 'where', 'humans', 'can', 'be', 'rebuilt', 'atomic', 'level', 'same', 'world', 'one', 'robots', 'fire', 'guns', 'miss', 'targets', 'Robots', 'hitting', 'targets', 'when', 'fire', 'near', 'future', 'extent', 'current', 'rebuilding', 'bodies', 'atomic', 'level', 'less', 'minute', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'far', 'future', 'ever.But', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'junk', '-and', 'similarly', 'stupid', 'crazily', 'overrated', 'success', 'District', '9', 'Blomkamp', 'doing', 'something', 'science', 'fiction', ""n't""]",N/A
1555465,A1WFEHAV42HTM5,B008JFUN50,Scrimshaw,"[3, 8]","For a film called Elysium, directed by Neill Blomkamp, there sure doesn't seem to be that many images or scenes of life there. Like 90 percent of the film takes place on a future ravaged, over-polluted, industrialized Earth focusing on Max Da Costa, played by Matt Damon or in a closed room on Elysium focusing on the elites of Elysian society including the secretary of defense Jessica Delacourt, played by Jodie Foster. I'll admit, it was a huge letdown for me. When I went to see this film last night and there were only a few scenes, mostly at the beginning and end, that focused on the beauty and luxury of Elysium. I went in to the theater thinking it would be the next visual masterpiece like Avatar or Life of Pi but instead it was much more like District 9, also directed by Blomkamp, and Children of Men in it's gritty atmosphere and violence. That's not to say I hated Elysium, because aside from the lack of scenes focusing on Elysium, it was a very impressive film. The action scenes and much of the futuristic technology are very cool, creative, and fun to watch. The themes of the film revolve around class, immigration, and healthcare, specifically in the USA in regards to Mexican and other Latin American immigrants. The story takes place in the year 2154 and revolves around Max trying to get to Elysium so that he won't die after getting hit with lethal doses of radiation during a tragic accident at work.The rich people living on Elysium, who are mostly white by the way, have very long life expectancies and no disease due to medical technology that quickly and painlessly cures any illness, and also has the ability to reconstruct damaged body parts. This technology is completely absent on Earth and because of this, and the high rate of disease and violence, many Earth citizens try desperately to get to Elysium, even if it's through illegal means, in order to cure themselves or escape the hell that Earth has become. It very similar to how many Mexicans try to cross the border illegally into America for a better chance at life and better healthcare. In fact, most of the Earth citizens are Hispanic in appearance and the film, rather than taking place on Elysium, mostly takes place in a future Los Angeles. In addition to Max, other important characters include Frey, played by Alice Braga a woman who was friends with Max as kids and has a daughter suffering from Leukemia, and Kruger, a vicious mercenary played by Sharlto Copley, who is the main villain of the film. He was excellent in his role, and as many others have noted, was one of the best characters in the film. The strongest point of this film, I believe, is the message that I took out of it, that any society where people are divided, whether it be class, color, caste, or even gender, is a failed society in the long run because it will only lead to anger, hatred, and violence that affects everyone, regardless of whether they're at the top or bottom of society. A truly great society is a society where everyone is equal, and no one truly believes they are above anyone else. Elysium may look like a beautiful paradise, but such a paradise can only last for so long when the world below looks as it does in this film.

It currently holds a 90% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, citing its unique story (a rarity in films these days), excellent acting, writing, and (despite its modest budget) special effects. Naturally, expectations were high for his follow up, Elysium. After viewing Blomkamp's second film, one wonders whether he was pressed for time, because it plays out like a first draft in need of heavy revision.In the year 2154, the ultra wealthy live on Elysium, a utopian space station where crime, sickness, and war are nonexistent. Everyone else is stuck on an overpopulated, impoverished earth. One man, however, has the means to change all of that and bring equality to the two worlds.There isn't a singular flaw that can be attributed to Elysium's catastrophic failure, but ""absolutely no character development"" is towards the top of the list. Our protagonist, Max (played by Matt Damon) is an ex-con who's trying to stay on the ""straight and narrow"". It's difficult to care about him because he is essentially a cardboard cutout, like every character in this movie. The squalor the earthlings live in is portrayed with excellent, stark imagery, but viewers need more than imagery to stay invested in the ""good"" characters and their plight. ""Why should we root for Max? What makes him so special?"" It's unfortunate that Blomkamp doesn't answer these questions.Some of the characters are an extreme hindrance to the success of the film. Jodie Foster plays Delacourt, Elysium's cruel, scheming Secretary of Defense who has a penchant for poor acting including, but not limited to, cringe-inducing lines unbecoming of a two-time academy award winning actress. Kruger (played by Sharlto Copley of District 9 fame) is meant to be a fun-to-watch villain, but Delacourt's personal mercenary has an incredibly obnoxious, pseudo-French/cockney accent that would be hilarious in a Monty Python movie, but it's distracting and less than intimidating in this one. The actors are not entirely to blame; it's difficult for a good actor/actress to perform well when given poor lines.The environments, spaceships, robots, and weapons are a visual treat, as expected. The action scenes have inventive elements, but they are too few and far between, often relying heavily on slow-motion. Ultimately, the film lacks character development and substance, both of which are essential for the kind of story Blomkamp is trying to tell.Considering how great District 9 was, and the enormous potential Elysium had, it's obvious Blomkamp has some great ideas; it's just a matter of allowing them to develop. 4/10",2,"Lacks character development and substance, plays out like a bad rough draft",1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,2780,"['2009', 'scrapped', 'Halo', 'movie', 'first-time', 'director', 'Neill', 'Blomkamp', 'shocked', 'world', 'District', '9', 'very', 'unique', 'film', 'extraterrestrial', 'refugees', 'stuck', 'contemporary', 'South', 'Africa', 'currently', '90', '%', 'fresh', 'rating', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'citing', 'unique', 'story', 'rarity', 'films', 'days', 'excellent', 'acting', 'writing', 'modest', 'budget', 'special', 'effects', 'Naturally', 'expectations', 'were', 'high', 'follow', 'up', 'Elysium', 'viewing', 'Blomkamp', 'second', 'film', 'one', 'was', 'pressed', 'time', 'out', 'first', 'draft', 'need', 'heavy', 'revision.In', 'year', '2154', 'ultra', 'wealthy', 'live', 'Elysium', 'utopian', 'space', 'station', 'where', 'crime', 'sickness', 'war', 'are', 'nonexistent', 'Everyone', 'else', 'stuck', 'overpopulated', 'impoverished', 'earth', 'One', 'man', 'however', 'means', 'change', 'bring', 'equality', 'two', 'worlds.There', ""n't"", 'singular', 'flaw', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'Elysium', 'catastrophic', 'failure', 'absolutely', 'character', 'development', 'top', 'list', 'protagonist', 'Max', 'played', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'ex-con', 'who', 'trying', 'stay', 'straight', 'narrow', 'difficult', 'care', 'essentially', 'cardboard', 'cutout', 'character', 'movie', 'squalor', 'earthlings', 'live', 'portrayed', 'excellent', 'stark', 'imagery', 'viewers', 'need', 'more', 'imagery', 'stay', 'invested', 'good', 'characters', 'plight', 'Why', 'should', 'root', 'Max', 'What', 'so', 'special', 'unfortunate', 'Blomkamp', ""n't"", 'answer', 'questions.Some', 'characters', 'are', 'extreme', 'hindrance', 'success', 'film', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Delacourt', 'Elysium', 'cruel', 'scheming', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'who', 'penchant', 'poor', 'acting', 'including', 'not', 'limited', 'cringe-inducing', 'lines', 'unbecoming', 'two-time', 'academy', 'award', 'winning', 'actress', 'Kruger', 'played', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'District', '9', 'fame', 'meant', 'be', 'fun-to-watch', 'villain', 'Delacourt', 'personal', 'mercenary', 'incredibly', 'obnoxious', 'pseudo-French/cockney', 'accent', 'would', 'be', 'hilarious', 'Monty', 'Python', 'movie', 'distracting', 'less', 'intimidating', 'one', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'entirely', 'blame', 'difficult', 'good', 'actor/actress', 'perform', 'well', 'when', 'given', 'poor', 'lines.The', 'environments', 'spaceships', 'robots', 'weapons', 'are', 'visual', 'treat', 'expected', 'action', 'scenes', 'have', 'inventive', 'elements', 'are', 'too', 'few', 'far', 'often', 'relying', 'heavily', 'slow-motion', 'Ultimately', 'film', 'character', 'development', 'substance', 'are', 'essential', 'kind', 'story', 'Blomkamp', 'trying', 'tell.Considering', 'how', 'great', 'District', '9', 'was', 'enormous', 'potential', 'Elysium', 'had', 'obvious', 'Blomkamp', 'great', 'ideas', 'just', 'matter', 'allowing', 'develop', '4/10']",N/A

There are characters with no motivation or very little (w-why does Kruger take Frey? Why does Spider suddenly want to fix everything? These aren't impossible questions to answer in character, but I'd have liked *some* gesture toward those), and then there's the how exactly does Max, you know, put on a t shirt that is somehow under that rig? And of course, it's another Straight White American Guy saves the world movie.However, it's the only movie I've seen this summer where I didn't know the ending after the first ten minutes of the film. Big plus.  The story seems disconnected, but I find it far better than the predictable plots of, say, Iron Man 3 or Pacific Rim.And it is beautifully filmed. To the point where perhaps the cinematography calls a bit *too* much attention to itself? But all you critics of the shaky cam, at least we didn't get blinded by lightflares like we do in like...every Joss Whedon movie ever?For people decrying this as Left Wing propaganda, I am sorry, but I can't quite follow your argument.  Primarily because, well...let's look at Patel, right?  Brown-skinned token president of Elysium who worries about how things look, instead of getting things done, and who is completely hamstrung by Delacourt? If that doesn't sound like Right Wing critiques of President Obama, I don't know what does! (And if you look at it, when Congress has just given themselves a free pass from Obamacare, so it's good enough for you and me but not good enough for them, well...Obamacare looks a lot like what Max faces on Earth!)A lot of the people who dislike it dislike the film for the very reason I like it: Max *isn't* a white knight hero from the get-go.  He's a bit selfish, not super smart, average Joe guy just trying to get by in a terrible world. He's not out to overthrow anything or be a hero.  He resists it throughout the movie.  I felt a lot more for Max than I did for Raleigh Becket in Pacific Rim (a movie of far more racist stereotypes and shallow characterization than this); and considering that I categorically do not like Matt Damon, this was very, very grudgingly given.  I see a lot more of Blade Runner's Deckerd than the other cookie cutter cardboard pretty boy heroes this summer's crop of films have given us.

By now there are only two classes of people on the planet: the super-rich, who long ago were ferried off Earth to the space station Elysium, where they can breathe clean air and continue to live in luxury ... and everyone else, still stuck back on Earth.Matt Damon plays Max, an ex-con just trying to go straight, who works a factory job helping to build the nuclear-powered robots that serve as the police force now. It's a tough as hell life on Earth, where you are guilty until proven innocent (especially if you have a record) and any attempts to fly an unauthorized ship to Elysium to escape this life might get you shot out of the sky - but after a horrible accident exposes Max to radiation poisoning, giving him only days to live, he throws convention and the law away, getting in touch with his old criminal cronies to find any way he can to Elysium - where medical pods exist, in abundance, that can cure any and all illness in the human body (again, a privilege ONLY now for the rich, in 2154).But on Elysium, the minister of defense, Delacourt (a blonde Jodie Foster, complete with an unidentifiable accent that is so ridiculous, it's distracting) has her own plans. Secretly planning to get the president of Elysium out of office so she can take over in a well-planned coup, those plans are thwarted when some badly-needed information she needs instead ends up with Max ... who, in turn, ends up with Delacourt's whacked-out, insane hired assassin Kruger (Sharlto Copley, as vicious as it gets here) after him.'Elysium' is a good film, I really liked it, but it does suffer a bit from predictability. You'll recognize bits here and there from other science fiction and action films, and again every time Jodie Foster speaks with that obviously-fake accent I just wanted to yell, ""STOP THAT!"". But even with standard plot devices and a couple of cartoonish characters, maybe because of Damon the film is still enjoyable to watch, and has some nice suspense that will have you rooting for Max and those he cares about.

The message would have a LITTLE credibility if Damon & Co. were opening their mansions to the homeless every night.Essentially, this movie has the economic and political understanding of a two year old. The economics shown simply would not, could not every operate. Well, actually it could - under a communist dictatorship. There is no other set of circumstances that would allow a wealthy elite to continue to pull in wealth from people as poor and jobless as the citizens were.Oh, and the silliness with those ""med beds"". As portrayed int he movie, these things can cure anything, cost literally nothing to run, consume no raw materials limiting their use and are fully automated. Yet, we are to believe, ""the rich"" keep them entirely to themselves because... well, I gather Damon and friends just figure that ""the rich"" are evil. Not the Hollywood rich, just all the rest of them.So, they keep the ""med beds"" to themselves, as a result disease on earth is rampant and Elysium is subject to intense hatred and nearly constant terrorist attacks. Does that make sense? nope. No, what would make sense in a world where such a fairy tale technology existed would be for the Elysium folks to simply cure anyone who wants it - for about $100 a shot. They would make HUGE amounts of money, be seen as benefactors and have a thriving, productive Earthly population to both create the goods they need (almost no one on Elysium works, apparently) and it would stop all the terrorism.But no no says Damon & Co. The rich are far too evil for that.It's all a fairly 2 dimensions, Occupy Wall Street view of the world... the view of a Hollywood leftist spending oh so much time wringing his hands about the evils of the 1% while he flies off in his private jet to have another fundraiser for people he makes damn sure he never has to spend much time with.Watch it for the effects if you want, they are good - but recognize the rest of it for the idiocy it is.",2,"Great FX, the political understanding of a 2 year old.",1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,2290,"['good', 'Elysium', 'was', 'visually', 'great', 'movie', 'few', 'decent', 'action', 'scenes.The', 'rest', '-I', 'find', 'HILARIOUS', 'be', 'getting', 'sort', 'simplistic', 'crap', 'how', 'rich', 'should', 'open', 'homes', 'wealth', 'everyone', 'bunch', 'millionaires', 'who', 'live', 'houses', 'high', 'walls', 'private', 'security', 'surrounding', 'message', 'would', 'have', 'LITTLE', 'credibility', 'Damon', 'Co.', 'were', 'opening', 'mansions', 'homeless', 'night.Essentially', 'movie', 'economic', 'political', 'understanding', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'economics', 'shown', 'simply', 'would', 'not', 'could', 'not', 'operate', 'Well', 'actually', 'could', 'communist', 'dictatorship', 'other', 'set', 'circumstances', 'would', 'allow', 'wealthy', 'elite', 'continue', 'pull', 'wealth', 'people', 'poor', 'jobless', 'citizens', 'were.Oh', 'silliness', 'med', 'beds', 'portrayed', 'int', 'movie', 'things', 'can', 'cure', 'anything', 'cost', 'literally', 'nothing', 'run', 'consume', 'raw', 'materials', 'limiting', 'use', 'are', 'fully', 'automated', 'are', 'believe', 'rich', 'keep', 'entirely', 'well', 'gather', 'Damon', 'friends', 'just', 'figure', 'rich', 'are', 'evil', 'Not', 'Hollywood', 'rich', 'just', 'rest', 'them.So', 'keep', 'med', 'beds', 'result', 'disease', 'earth', 'rampant', 'Elysium', 'subject', 'intense', 'hatred', 'nearly', 'constant', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'make', 'sense', 'nope', 'No', 'what', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'world', 'where', 'fairy', 'tale', 'technology', 'existed', 'would', 'be', 'Elysium', 'folks', 'simply', 'cure', 'anyone', 'who', '100', 'shot', 'would', 'make', 'HUGE', 'amounts', 'money', 'be', 'seen', 'benefactors', 'have', 'thriving', 'productive', 'Earthly', 'population', 'create', 'goods', 'need', 'almost', 'one', 'Elysium', 'works', 'apparently', 'would', 'stop', 'terrorism.But', 'Damon', 'Co', 'rich', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'evil', 'that.It', 'fairly', '2', 'dimensions', 'Occupy', 'Wall', 'Street', 'view', 'world', 'view', 'Hollywood', 'leftist', 'spending', 'oh', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'wringing', 'hands', 'evils', '1', '%', 'off', 'private', 'jet', 'have', 'fundraiser', 'people', 'damn', 'sure', 'never', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'with.Watch', 'effects', 'want', 'are', 'good', 'recognize', 'rest', 'idiocy']",N/A

1555494,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B008JFUN50,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[1, 1]","things I liked or thought were pretty strong story-wise:(1) friendship between the Matt Damon character and his friend, the one who helped him get home after his industrial accident;(2) the difference in medical care between the haves and have-less;(3) I thought it was believable that the Matt Damon character was treated so poorly by his employer and I found it believable that he'd basically beg to keep his job and also work with a broken arm/wrist;(4) found it believable that the Jodie Foster character would destroy two ships loaded with illegal citizens, though I found it unbelievable that she'd be reprimanded for it; and(5) found very believable the huge military capability differences between the haves and the have nots.story elements that were not as successful:(1) the Matt Damon character received a lethal dose of radiation, was stabbed in the gut (and kept walking), survived a ship crash, a car crash, and engaged in multiple fist fights yet managed to keep on going until he basically laid down his sword. I know the writer tried to explain it with the surgery he underwent to make him stronger, but I wasn't persuaded. in my opinion, any one of the physical assaults he endured would've had him in bed for a month, if not longer. I just don't see how a person can get stabbed in the stomach and keep moving;(2) the military complex, portrayed by the Jodie Foster character, the politician and the weapons contractor, were not believable as foes. my opinion, more believable that they'd work together (especially considering terrorism, and the fact that the world is getting to the end of it's affordable petroleum), along with banking and other major businesses, to control the country, and I believe are principally lead by the military. that is especially easier to see with domestic spying information increasingly reported. believe they work together and so to have them squabbling in the film wasn't believable;(3) the Jodie Foster character, as the top security person in the country, I guess the secretary of war (is there such a thing?) would not rely on a mentally unstable mercenary, there'd be no need, she'd have the police and multiple levels of security agencies at her disposal and she'd use them. I believe the writer wrote the story this way for a neat and tidy ending, but just not believable that the head of the military would only have one go-to guy, a merc, and that she'd refuse medical attention once she was wounded. she'd already made a speech about protecting her children, etc.  No evidence that she was so disheartened that she'd basically take the opportunity of being attacked to kill herself. if the writer wanted that to fly, he should've given some evidence that she was depressed;(4) also not believable that she'd allow her go-to guy to be fired. as she was planning a coup, very weak story-wise that she'd cut him loose, makes no sense. if she'd been forced to cut ties to him for political reasons, she'd have made sure to have a conversation with him to let him know she'd take care of him. her character needed alot more writing and needed to be thought through alot more;(5) aside from the earth citizens having poor medical care and living in an unpleasant environment, no evidence that they had no access to potable water or food; nobody looked to be starving, which I didn't find believable. think it'd be much more likely that in a country with a crumbling infrastructure, water from a faucet wouldn't be forthcoming (as it was here), and neither would food. the old woman who helped the Matt Damon character had a cart load of pigs and she was a senior citizen, female, out by herself and unprotected. in a really desperate world, food would be gold and that woman's pigs would be stolen and if she protested, she'd be beaten or killed. not believable that she'd be out with her animals by herself w/out protection;(6) unfortunately, human history presents many examples of the strong preying on the weak, but in this story the powerful leaders of Elysium were presented as essentially defensive, trying to keep the poor out of their territory. found this unbelievable. would've been much more believable had the powerful citizens of Elysium enslaved those on earth, not just sex slaves, but all types of other slavery as well. not the ordinary, rich Elysium citizens but some of the powerful Elysiums would've sought to tap the human resource potential of the earth citizens, say in the way England colonized India, or various European countries colonized various African countries, or the early American settlers took America from Native Americans, and of course, there are many, many other examples of predation other than the ones I've mentioned. As the more successful citizens with unlimited life (all disease cured), based on human history, some element of Elysium citizens would've sought domination of the earth people, rather than been merely defensive, as portrayed here. just not believable, based on history;(7) just didn't like the story overall. the villains were too cardboardy, too one-dimensional and just not believable. they seemed basically insane and stereotypical. the hero was kicked around like a dog until he got so sick he was forced to become a criminal again. definitely the hero and the villains needed more work, to be thought through better. it would've helped if the Jodie Foster character made some sense and it would've helped to see her working effectively as a team member with political leaders and other leaders to control her world and earth. it would've helped to have the Matt Damon character with more relationships to help us see who he was. he had one guy friend, but he definitely needed more to flesh him out. would've been great to see citizens on Elysium, even just a family, to understand how that territory worked. ditto for a family on earth, especially on earth, to understand how the economy was run, if people paid their gas bills, had electricity, went to the grocery store, just a whole lot of practical/pragmatic information not provided about how citizens survived on Elysium and on earth and providing that information would've helped the story.(8) more about story: Matt Damon's character sacrificed his life so those on earth could have first class health care and a first class life. he did this by hacking into the elysium computer system. obviously, elysium has computer programmers who will sooner rather than later, rewrite the program denying earth people their newly illegally acquired premium health care and status. elysium wasn't destroyed, the territory works the way it did when the story began. the Jodie Foster character will be replaced with a new secretary of war, the physical damage to esysium will be repaired and the earthlings new privileges revoked. earth hackers performed an act of war on elysium. compare it to hackers accessing the social security payment program and falsely paying out benefits to every person worldwide, whoever had a checking account would suddenly find they have an extra $5,000 in their account. well, obviously, social security would jump on that, and find a way to stop the hackers and get their money back. it would be expensive, but social security would do it. elysium would also do it.(9) in the future, energy prices will skyrocket, pushing food, housing, transportation, the cost of everything to the stratosphere - Americans, and citizens of other first world countries, will protest - hence the reason in my opinion that governments like America and their security are laying the groundwork now for reducing human rights and enlarging their domestic spy programs, trampling on human rights, and worse. in that reality, world leaders, already struggling to provide care to aging populations with less money, are going to have real difficulty. as the most successful world governments have benefited from huge petroleum and other energy deposits and have largely not taken the opportunity to prioritize lifting their poor out of poverty but rather have largely served the wealthy and successful, who assist them into office with campaign contributions, it seems highly unlikely that when their leadership is really needed, that they'll suddenly find the will to prioritize their service to poor people. in my opinion, world governments already know about projected energy shortfalls and America, again in my opinion, is not preparing it's citizens for that shortfall, but instead is preparing it's military and security organizations and systems and amending it's laws to deal with protests. my take: the next 50 years will be grim for ordinary citizens in first world countries who find their take home pay won't cut it and who also find that ejecting political leaders won't accomplish a thing, because those same leaders are not the real rulers. elysium got abit right, i.e., crumbling infrastructure and the wealthier more successful citizenry choosing to separate themselves, partially for reasons of physical safety, from the masses. what elysium got wrong, was that it fails to ask/show why. if the writer had asked why, elysium could've gone into a whole new direction, a more believable and honest direction. crumbling infrastructure is due to lack of resources used to maintain them, like the buildings we see on earth in the film, decrepit and with walls missing. well that's not caused by evil humans, it's because cement is a very energy intensive building material and in a time when petroleum prices skyrocket, cement structures will be too expensive to repair, especially in residential housing, unless the owners/tenants can afford the repairs - and of course poor tenants won't be able to afford expensive repairs. the writer of elysium showed humans in dingy surroundings, many were dirty and obviously poor, but no one looked as if they'd missed a meal, or had no access to water, and that was a mistake in storytelling. a whole lot more people would be starving. food, water, and other essential resources, on earth and on elysium, would've been very interesting to focus on story-wise. how the haves and the have-nots dealt with less and more expensive food, water and the reduced ability to comfortably run their societies. based on what I'm seeing now and on what I've read of the past, those ruling the world have a tendency to enslave the weaker. elysium really didn't go there, and as I wrote earlier, one of the weaker points of the film were presenting elysium rulers as essentially defensive, just trying to keep the interlopers out.  doesn't ring true. military rulers/security are essentially proactive in nature, they'd see offense as a necessity, otherwise the masses of unhappy people would overrun them. so when the Jodie Foster character had the first two illegal shuttles destroyed, that was very believable; what was unbelievable was that she'd be reprimanded for it. earth people wouldn't be allowed to wander around doing their own thing, the rulers in elysium would control them, essentially enslave them, use them. health care wouldn't be denied earth people, it would be used to motivate them to do tasks for their elysium controllers. the writer of elsyium showed the desire for rich, successful people to separate themselves from the poor and the criminal, a behavior which has been ongoing for 10,000 years, made worse by racism, ignorance and the unwillingness of ourselves and our leaders to provide a basic social safety net for all people, despite our propaganda. this is a failure of our species, but not new. what the writer didn't show, perhaps because he can't see it, is what's coming: a step back into slavery for the majority of the world's population. military/security leaders are already laying the groundwork by significantly reducing human rights and protections, and greatly increasing the ability of the state to monitor citizens, on the pretext of fighting terrorism. that pretext works because terrorism does exist, which is why governments are able to play this card and not have citizens participating in massive protests. but the real reason this is being done in my opinion is because there is coming a time, soon, when cheap energy is no longer available and previously first world citizens get a taster of expensive energy, basically changing their lifestyle from a first world to a third world citizen in one generation or two, as a significantly larger percentage of their income will be used for necessities. this is something first world citizens are not used to and they won't like it and they'll protest, to no avail. everything from toothpaste to toilet paper will become more expensive, food, dvds, clothes, every single thing, and people will blame politicians, just like they're doing now, (as the process has already begun, but most don't know it), but it's the military/security who rules, and ordinary citizens cannot vote them out.  leaders have already shown a willingness to use drones against their enemies, and it is they who decide who their enemies are. probably starting in 20 to 50 years, when world leaders can longer hide the increasing expense (currently manufacturers are reducing package sizing rather than raising prices, but they won't be able to do that forever), then our world will be very unstable for awhile. now that would've been an interesting story, one which could've given movie goers a heads up, and also got them thinking about possible survival strategies: you know, helped them even though they'd not know the film story they'd currently be viewing for entertainment might actually help them survive future upheaval. but few government/military/security allow truly helpful movies to be made, especially ones that tell on them, or warn citizens about the future, especially if it reflects poorly on rulers. so instead we're given a film like elysium, with it's hero who can somehow, unbelievably, remain on his feet despite being stabbed in the gut, and who provides first class health care, albeit temporarily, for all. bread and circuses. 2 and a half stars.P.S. I rarely enjoy a story where a main character seems insane or makes no sense, i.e., the Jodie Foster character, and her henchman. cartoon characters.",2,"Matt Damon is a futuristic Robin Hood, at

He tricks the computer that controls everything into making them all citizens of Elysium---after fighting with a bunch of evil-doers, of course.So I guess the message Hollywood wants us to take away from this film is that we should just let in any illegal immigrants and make them all citizens---and if we don't we're just evil and greedy.",1,It's a Thinly Disguised Lecture About Immigration,1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,1369,"['film', 'ruined', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'heavy', 'handed', 'lecture', 'fill', 'blank', 'liberal', 'issue', 'case', 'pro-immigration', 'message.SPOILERSThe', 'wealthy', 'Haves', 'who', 'are', 'mostly', 'Caucasion', 'live', 'space', 'station', 'called', 'Elysium', 'where', 'everything', 'perfectly', 'manicured', 'beautiful', 'selfish', 'cruel', 'representative', 'played', 'Jodie', 'Foster.The', 'poor', 'Have-Nots', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'Hispanic', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'one', 'white', 'dude', 'sea', 'brown', 'live', 'polluted', 'crowded', 'earth', 'where', 'everything', 'ugly', 'decomposing.The', 'Haves', 'are', 'uncaring', 'two', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'who', 'hoard', 'stuff', 'including', 'medi-chambers', 'can', 'cure', 'illness', 'attempt', 'Have-Nots', 'get', 'Elysium', 'met', 'lethal', 'force', 'even', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'pass.And', 'Haves', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'charitable', 'organizations', 'help', 'out', 'Have-Nots', 'humans', 'have', 'really', 'changed', 'year', '2154.In', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'fashion', 'hero', 'played', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'entire', 'planet', 'Have-Nots', 'singlehandedly', 'computer', 'everything', 'making', 'citizens', 'Elysium', '-after', 'fighting', 'bunch', 'evil-doers', 'course.So', 'guess', 'message', 'Hollywood', 'take', 'away', 'film', 'should', 'just', 'let', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'make', 'citizens', '-and', 'do', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'just', 'evil', 'greedy']",N/A
1555515,A2GS6XMWDUA4KG,B008JFUN50,T. Briggs,"[18, 27]","Well Earth has gone to los peros as signified by everyone now speaking Spanish, living in a trash strewn graffiti laden environment reeking of taco smoke and who is either an unemployed car thief or employed &#8220;on the line&#8221; building the robots that mercilessly enslave them.  And up in the sky is Elysium where they speak French, drink champagne and where Jody Foster is a Defense Minister whose first act in the movie is to take out the illegals trying to, oh please, &#8220;immigrate&#8221; illegally to Elysium using special, you guessed it, Homeland Security agents who fire missiles at the illegal shuttles which aside from carrying multicultural illegals are also strewn with trash which floats about the gravity free cabin while the sweating multicultural illegals pray and cry because that&#8217;s what people do when they&#8217;re fleeing towards something.  Throw in Matt Damon and let&#8217;s call him &#8220;Max&#8221; as the poor put upon &#8220;worker&#8221; with a criminal past and who, as a victim of big business, is given a choice to either enter the radioactive chamber to push a button, because apparently even robots rate higher on the socioeconomic ladder than actual people.  Sure.  All that is really just the backdrop so a CEO from Elysium who has to mingle with the masses in his factory gets to remind one of the lesser beings not to breathe on him.  Yawn.  Ok, we&#8217;re almost done with the clich&eacute;s but not quite.  Jodie gets in trouble for shooting down the illegals and gets to ask the President if he has children.  You&#8217;d think she&#8217;d know the answer to that.  He only says no so she has an opportunity to use the old, &#8220;well if you did then you wouldn&#8217;t second guess my methods to protect what we have built here.&#8221;  Sound familiar?  I&#8217;m already suspecting she didn&#8217;t actually &#8220;build&#8221; that although she may have purchased the labor of those who did but like any them vs us, the them seem to not understand that paying for something is not the same thing as building something.  But I digress.  I&#8217;m 32 minutes into this movie and I already know how it&#8217;s going to end.  Sure there&#8217;s a love interest who happens to have a child with an illness.  And our newly radioactive hero who has just moments to live and a black market way to get them both up to Elysium for a cure.  Yeah cuz that will work.I must say Jodie Foster is sexy and alluring as a business mom with a bad French accent who wants to rule the world by engineering a coup.  Meanwhile back on Earth our hero goes through a chop shop op to, oh I don&#8217;t know, become a borg.  Ok, so there&#8217;s nothing conspicuous about that, he&#8217;s going to just fit right in.  It&#8217;s also comforting to know in 2150-something thugs still wear do rags.  You know it&#8217;s not going to end well for anyone but did you know the code for bad spy is an English accent?  Well now you do.  You can also feel comfort in the knowledge sophisticated defense robots have the same bad aim as human bad guys when they&#8217;re firing at the good guy.  Don&#8217;t make Max mad or he&#8217;ll be a, wait for it, Mad Max.  Sigh.  So let&#8217;s recap.  Useless diseased masses speak Spanish, evil spy hit men speak Cockney and elites, even those named Patel, wield bad French accents.When all else fails call out the drones.  And at one point they do just that.  We&#8217;ve already stopped caring what data Max is carrying that now makes him a target but that usually happens when a script is written to support action sequences rather than plot.  Have I mentioned how flawlessly perfect Jodie Foster is with designer hair, clothes and bad French accent?  So Max now has Elysium&#8217;s operating system stored in his head so he could, theoretically, control Elysium.  Of course any space engineers capable of building such a world would never ever have a back up on, say a thumb drive, because if they did that would kind of make the whole movie pointless.  But Max thinks he can save the world by unlocking Elysium for everyone.I suppose the fact Elysium is a giant wheel and in spite of having no roof manages to retain atmosphere is one continuity issue too many but apparently hospitals are also no longer necessary because every home has a healing machine, I suppose to handle the daily terminal diseases the inhabitants rarely need.  It&#8217;s simply a wonder of Imagineering that they seem to be placed near the kitchen because, well, who knows why?  Does it even matter?  We know we&#8217;re going to see the whole thing coming down in figurative flames at the end after the first five minutes because no clich&eacute; is wasted on this bloody, violent excuse for a film.  And with one computer entry &#8211; earth population-legal - Mad Max saves the world &#8211; and no one, absolutely no one, has the computer hackem sackem stuff to stop the upload that reoots Elysium and makes it free for everyone.  How socialist.  This was a horrible movie that probably felt good making because it feeds the poor, downtrodden couch potatoes the lie that a fair society is possible.  And yes the &#8220;dialect coach&#8221; got an undeserved credit at the end as did Seasons Fine Foods catering.  I&#8217;m so glad I waited til it was $4.99  to rent as I was tempted on several occasions to pay the $12.99 because I really do love sci-fi but this was just sigh-fi.",3,Clicheysium Sigh-Fi not

She is responsible for the shooting down of airships not cleared to come into Elysium airspace. Down on earth Matt Damon plays Max the tough ex-convict scratching a living in a factory, and as an ex -criminal is required to report to a robot parole officer. Neil Blomkamp the director made a previous sci-fi film on a small budget(District 9)which made a massive impact. The risk is that the follow up will with a bigger budget get smaller audiences. Was he only able to get funding for a sci-fi movie when he wanted to make a different movie? This film's heart is in the right place: the way we treat healthcare, immigrants. Healthcare should it seems to say be free at the point of use. This is sci-fi of a kind of wish fulfilment of present needs,not an attempt to predict what will occur in the future. Blomkamp is really interested in the present. What's going on with healthcare, what's going on with gated communities? Was this the right way to deal with these issues? For Blomkamp it seems so. With science fiction, we are able to divorce ourselves from the modern context and see what we really think about the underlying issues.Lots of the sci-fi comes to us second hand, we've seen a lot of this before(Johnny Nmemonic, Robocop).Their one desire, Max and his childhood sweetheart and her ailing daughter, is to get to Elysium, and it's not that interesting once they get there what they do with it. With sci-fi you want cleverness in the use of technology, the main plot point here is they go after someone without knowing who it is (an Elysium bigwig )to get a crucial piece of data. The big thing in this movie is his main villain Sharlto Copley is a South African, and he's as nasty as they come. Matt Damon gives a very solid, physical performance(and is the major draw).Jodie Foster starts off promisingly but is given nothing to do. Spider(Maura) is like the creative midfield player in football, essential for effecting transitions, plot points in a suitably colourful manner. Of course Blomkamp is very good on shoot'em ups and gadgetry like the exosleton Max wears to give his shortened life more strength, but this is not what the best sci-fi is about(Stalker, Solaris),where we are tipped into deep thought with few specialeffects. He is good at grainy, downtrodden worlds. Los Angeles is like Mexico City and the vast majority seem to speak Spanish. A third world polluted planet. But what lets it down? As a story the action dominated character and plot to the detriment of the film, which poorly scripted gives no exploration of the earth environment or that of Elysium and breaks out into formulaic robotics, extinguishing the satiric spark.",3,Sci-fi as social concern,1377043200,"08 21, 2013",2013,2973,"['Elysium', 'vast', 'discrepancies', 'wealth', 'have', 'separated', 'off', 'very', 'rich', 'Elysium', 'vast', 'orbiting', 'station', 'enjoy', 'blissful', 'free-from-care', 'world', 'vast', 'majority', 'are', 'consigned', 'overpopulated', 'cites', 'full', 'disease', 'decay.Jodie', 'Foster', 'defence', 'minister', 'government', 'Elysium', 'responsible', 'shooting', 'airships', 'not', 'cleared', 'come', 'Elysium', 'airspace', 'Down', 'earth', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Max', 'tough', 'ex-convict', 'scratching', 'living', 'factory', 'ex', '-criminal', 'required', 'report', 'robot', 'parole', 'officer', 'Neil', 'Blomkamp', 'director', 'made', 'previous', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'small', 'budget', 'District', '9', 'made', 'massive', 'impact', 'risk', 'follow', 'up', 'will', 'bigger', 'budget', 'get', 'smaller', 'audiences', 'Was', 'only', 'able', 'get', 'funding', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'when', 'wanted', 'make', 'different', 'movie', 'film', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'way', 'treat', 'healthcare', 'immigrants', 'Healthcare', 'should', 'say', 'be', 'free', 'point', 'use', 'sci-fi', 'kind', 'wish', 'fulfilment', 'present', 'needs', 'not', 'attempt', 'predict', 'what', 'will', 'occur', 'future', 'Blomkamp', 'really', 'interested', 'present', 'What', 'going', 'healthcare', 'what', 'going', 'gated', 'communities', 'Was', 'right', 'way', 'deal', 'issues', 'Blomkamp', 'so', 'science', 'fiction', 'are', 'able', 'divorce', 'modern', 'context', 'see', 'what', 'really', 'think', 'underlying', 'issues.Lots', 'sci-fi', 'second', 'hand', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'Johnny', 'Nmemonic', 'Robocop', '.Their', 'one', 'desire', 'Max', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'ailing', 'daughter', 'get', 'Elysium', 'not', 'interesting', 'once', 'get', 'what', 'do', 'sci-fi', 'want', 'cleverness', 'use', 'technology', 'main', 'plot', 'point', 'here', 'go', 'someone', 'knowing', 'who', 'Elysium', 'bigwig', 'get', 'crucial', 'piece', 'data', 'big', 'thing', 'movie', 'main', 'villain', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'South', 'African', 'as', 'nasty', 'come', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'very', 'solid', 'physical', 'performance', 'major', 'draw', '.Jodie', 'Foster', 'promisingly', 'given', 'nothing', 'do', 'Spider', 'Maura', 'creative', 'midfield', 'player', 'football', 'essential', 'effecting', 'transitions', 'plot', 'points', 'suitably', 'colourful', 'manner', 'course', 'Blomkamp', 'very', 'good', ""shoot'em"", 'ups', 'gadgetry', 'exosleton', 'Max', 'give', 'shortened', 'life', 'more', 'strength', 'not', 'what', 'best', 'sci-fi', 'Stalker', 'Solaris', 'where', 'are', 'tipped', 'deep', 'thought', 'few', 'specialeffects', 'good', 'grainy', 'downtrodden', 'worlds', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Mexico', 'City', 'vast', 'majority', 'seem', 'speak', 'Spanish', 'third', 'world', 'polluted', 'planet', 'what', 'down', 'story', 'action', 'dominated', 'character', 'plot', 'detriment', 'film', 'poorly', 'scripted', 'exploration', 'earth', 'environment', 'Elysium', 'breaks', 'out', 'formulaic', 'robotics', 'extinguishing', 'satiric', 'spark']",N/A

It reminds me of the Star Trek (original series) episode, ""The Cloud Minders"" in which the cloud city is beautiful, cultured and peaceful and all of that is paid for by the dirty workers on the planet below. Elysium has a substantially similar plot and some fine actors, Matt Damon and Jody Foster do their jobs well. But Elysium wasn't written by Star Trek writers.The movie does not seem to be well-thought out. The costumes are weirdly anachronistic, Jody Foster is wearing what corporate big wigs would wear today, Matt Damon wears old torn tee-shirts. The violence is predictable and so over-the-top that it becomes boring.There is a large mistake in the movie titles which tell us that this movie is set in the far future 2154 -- more than one hundred years from now, but at the same time, it takes place in the 21st Century -- hey dude, that's our century! 2154 is in the 22nd Century, that should be obvious to the movie makers.The main characters don't show any development that leads them to their final denouement. Matt Damon's starts out selfish, is selfish throughout the violence and decides at the end to be a hero. Jody Foster's spends her time keeping the bad elements out of Elysium in an entirely selfish manner and doesn't change at all until suddenly at her character's end. This leads to the plot feeling disjointed. The movie goes where you expect it to go, but it doesn't really allow character development to get there.

As the story unfolds, it soon becomes clear that those who live in Elysium are in power and have the best that modern science and technology has to offer to support their lives, while the masses on Earth live in squalor in a police-state society.Damon's character is a factory worker with a criminal past that is just scraping by when misfortune enters his life.  The only way out for him is to reach Elysium, but citizens from Earth are apparently almost never allowed to go there.  His journey to try to get there requires desperate measures that set up an action-driven plotline laced with elements of drama and a bit of political intrigue.I love both the look and intensity of this film.  Neil Blomkamp shows us a future that is technologically-advanced in a plausible way  , but that also contains some sobering and somewhat terrifying elements.  The story is accessible and easy to relate to without unnecessary complication, and yet the society we are shown has a depth and complexity that makes it compelling and all too real.  Although we are not given much of the history that leads to this future, it is not hard to extrapolate from certain elements of current human society and accept this as one plausible outcome.I would have loved to have spent more time being immersed in this world, but what's there is a self-contained story that should leave most viewers satisfied with time well spent.  Our solace for having to leave is that Blomkamp is still early in his career as a writer and director, and we can hope to see much more of his creativity and storytelling in years to come.",5,An insanely great sci-fi film,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,2117,"['Neil', 'Blomkamp', 'done', 'again', 'shown', '34', 'District', '9', '34', 'was', 'not', 'one-trick', 'pony', 'part-dystopian', 'part-visionary', 'look', 'futuristic', 'Earth', 'set', '22nd', 'century', 'fantastic', 'spectacle', 'laced', 'social', 'commentary.Matt', 'Damon', 'hero', 'action-drama', 'set', 'future', 'human', 'society', 'Earth', 'suffered', 'significant', 'decay', 'wealth', 'means', 'have', 'escaped', 'planetary', 'bounds', 'live', 'artificial', 'ring-world', 'habitat', 'called', 'Elysium', 'orbit', 'planet', 'story', 'unfolds', 'soon', 'clear', 'who', 'live', 'Elysium', 'are', 'power', 'have', 'best', 'modern', 'science', 'technology', 'offer', 'support', 'lives', 'masses', 'Earth', 'live', 'squalor', 'police-state', 'society.Damon', 'character', 'factory', 'worker', 'criminal', 'past', 'just', 'scraping', 'when', 'misfortune', 'life', 'only', 'way', 'reach', 'Elysium', 'citizens', 'Earth', 'are', 'apparently', 'almost', 'never', 'allowed', 'go', 'there', 'journey', 'try', 'get', 'there', 'desperate', 'measures', 'set', 'up', 'action-driven', 'plotline', 'laced', 'elements', 'drama', 'bit', 'political', 'intrigue.I', 'look', 'intensity', 'film', 'Neil', 'Blomkamp', 'future', 'technologically-advanced', 'plausible', 'way', 'also', 'sobering', 'somewhat', 'terrifying', 'elements', 'story', 'accessible', 'easy', 'relate', 'unnecessary', 'complication', 'yet', 'society', 'are', 'shown', 'depth', 'complexity', 'compelling', 'too', 'real', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'much', 'history', 'future', 'not', 'hard', 'extrapolate', 'certain', 'elements', 'current', 'human', 'society', 'accept', 'one', 'plausible', 'outcome.I', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'being', 'immersed', 'world', 'what', 'self-contained', 'story', 'should', 'leave', 'most', 'viewers', 'satisfied', 'time', 'well', 'spent', 'solace', 'having', 'leave', 'Blomkamp', 'still', 'early', 'career', 'writer', 'director', 'can', 'hope', 'see', 'much', 'more', 'creativity', 'storytelling', 'years', 'come']",N/A

1555527,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B008JFUN50,The People's Critic,"[4, 9]","What if Wall-E were real?  That's the question director Matt Damon and director Neill Blomkamp try to answer in Elysium.  Actually, there have been plenty of films depicting world-ending scenarios this summer, nonetheless, this is the one that stars Matt Damon, so pay attention.The word ""Elysium"" actually refers to a Greek notion of the afterlife where those chosen by the gods would spend eternity.  Blomkamp's Elysium reveals a similar idea with the ironic twist being that the ""chosen few"" are simply the world's wealthiest and most privileged.  Here Elysium is a space station constructed miles above Earth's atmosphere designed to house the planet's most fortunate, so that they can maintain their lavish lifestyle without the burdens of living on an overpopulated Earth.  The year is 2154.  Max (Damon) is an average guy living in L.A. who finds himself in a life or death situation that can only be cured by the advanced medical treatments available on Elysium.  Elysium's strict immigration laws prevent unauthorized travel to the haven, leaving Max to desperate measures.Blomkamp's film is wonderfully directed.  With brilliant juxtapositions between Elysium and Earth, he designs a very well made story that looks all too real!  Scenes of sweeping, Eden-esque beauty are shattered by guerrilla-style wildness of a civilization clinging to existence.  Slightly reminiscent of Minority Report, Max's humanity and loss thereof is accentuated with symbolic intensity and careful pacing.  His decent into despair is marked by a crude cyborg-like surgical implant that Blomkamp uses to remind us of how close we are from becoming a race of data transfer capsules.  The film's various villains are united and yet compartmentalized representing a visionary balance of complexity that while slightly excessive could have been tremendously overbearing.  Blomkamp's previous film District 9 was in a similar topical vein, and while it was a better film overall than Elysium, this latest film is a finer directorial effort, perhaps worthy of Oscar's attention, although unlikely given the film's weaknesses in other areas.Elysium's main problem is in the writing.  The problem is that Elysium should be more upsetting than it is.  It attempts to invoke the spirit, the outrage, and the temperament of the Occupy Wall-Street movement, showing a wealthy 1% looking down on a struggling and desperate 99%.  However, this is done in a rather heavy-handed way that comes across simplistic and, at times, stereotypically vapid.  This is most apparent in examining Jodi Foster's Secretary Delacourt who attempts to plan a coup for seemingly no better reason than because her fascist ways are more fascist than the current fascist in charge.  Foster does her best with what she's given, but a complicated issue is reduced to a shred of viability, turning what could have been a deeply stirring sci-fi commentary into just another by the numbers hero tale.  Questions are left unanswered especially in the film's closing act, which offers a naive and, while plausible, uneven resolution.  Not to mention that the film fails to soften the reality that Damon, Blomkamp, and company are pandering to a low to middle class audience about the gap between the haves and the have-nots.  I had a similar issue with Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby from earlier this Spring.  This is the ""Catch-22&#8243; of A-List Hollywood in the economically polarized 21st century.Pompousness aside, Elysium offers a fast-paced, stirring, visually well-made exploration of a slice of humanity.  While it may not accomplish what it set out to do contextually, it is still a worthy film deserving of some credence.  BElysium is rated R and has a refreshingly appropriate running time of 1 hour and 37 minutes.  While not the near masterpiece of sci-fi that was District 9, Elysium is a good summer movie and a great example of visionary directing.",4,"You've Seen Movies Like this, but It's Still Great!",1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,3913,"['What', 'Wall-E', 'were', 'real', 'question', 'director', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'director', 'Neill', 'Blomkamp', 'try', 'answer', 'Elysium', 'Actually', 'have', 'been', 'plenty', 'films', 'depicting', 'world-ending', 'scenarios', 'summer', 'nonetheless', 'one', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'so', 'pay', 'attention.The', 'word', 'Elysium', 'actually', 'Greek', 'notion', 'afterlife', 'where', 'chosen', 'gods', 'would', 'spend', 'eternity', 'Blomkamp', 'Elysium', 'similar', 'idea', 'ironic', 'twist', 'being', 'chosen', 'few', 'are', 'simply', 'world', 'wealthiest', 'most', 'privileged', 'Here', 'Elysium', 'space', 'station', 'constructed', 'miles', 'Earth', 'atmosphere', 'designed', 'house', 'planet', 'most', 'fortunate', 'can', 'maintain', 'lavish', 'lifestyle', 'burdens', 'living', 'overpopulated', 'Earth', 'year', '2154', 'Max', 'Damon', 'average', 'guy', 'living', 'L.A.', 'who', 'life', 'death', 'situation', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'cured', 'advanced', 'medical', 'treatments', 'available', 'Elysium', 'Elysium', 'strict', 'immigration', 'laws', 'prevent', 'unauthorized', 'travel', 'haven', 'leaving', 'Max', 'desperate', 'measures.Blomkamp', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'directed', 'brilliant', 'juxtapositions', 'Elysium', 'Earth', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'story', 'too', 'real', 'Scenes', 'sweeping', 'Eden-esque', 'beauty', 'are', 'shattered', 'guerrilla-style', 'wildness', 'civilization', 'clinging', 'existence', 'Slightly', 'reminiscent', 'Minority', 'Report', 'Max', 'humanity', 'loss', 'thereof', 'accentuated', 'symbolic', 'intensity', 'careful', 'pacing', 'decent', 'despair', 'marked', 'crude', 'cyborg-like', 'surgical', 'implant', 'Blomkamp', 'remind', 'how', 'close', 'are', 'becoming', 'race', 'data', 'transfer', 'capsules', 'film', 'various', 'villains', 'are', 'united', 'yet', 'compartmentalized', 'representing', 'visionary', 'balance', 'complexity', 'slightly', 'excessive', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tremendously', 'overbearing', 'Blomkamp', 'previous', 'film', 'District', '9', 'was', 'similar', 'topical', 'vein', 'was', 'better', 'film', 'overall', 'Elysium', 'latest', 'film', 'finer', 'directorial', 'effort', 'perhaps', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'attention', 'unlikely', 'given', 'film', 'weaknesses', 'other', 'areas.Elysium', 'main', 'problem', 'writing', 'problem', 'Elysium', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'upsetting', 'invoke', 'spirit', 'outrage', 'temperament', 'Occupy', 'Wall-Street', 'movement', 'showing', 'wealthy', '1', '%', 'looking', 'down', 'struggling', 'desperate', '99', '%', 'However', 'done', 'rather', 'heavy-handed', 'way', 'simplistic', 'times', 'stereotypically', 'vapid', 'most', 'apparent', 'examining', 'Jodi', 'Foster', 'Secretary', 'Delacourt', 'who', 'attempts', 'plan', 'coup', 'seemingly', 'better', 'reason', 'fascist', 'ways', 'are', 'more', 'fascist', 'current', 'fascist', 'charge', 'Foster', 'best', 'what', 'given', 'complicated', 'issue', 'reduced', 'shred', 'viability', 'turning', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'deeply', 'stirring', 'sci-fi', 'commentary', 'just', 'numbers', 'hero', 'tale', 'Questions', 'are', 'left', 'unanswered', 'especially', 'film', 'closing', 'act', 'naive', 'plausible', 'uneven', 'resolution', 'Not', 'mention', 'film', 'soften', 'reality', 'Damon', 'Blomkamp', 'company', 'are', 'pandering', 'low', 'middle', 'class', 'audience', 'gap', 'haves', 'have-nots', 'had', 'similar', 'issue', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'earlier', 'Spring', 'Catch-22', '8243', 'A-List', 'Hollywood', 'economically', 'polarized', '21st', 'century.Pompousness', 'aside', 'Elysium', 'fast-paced', 'stirring', 'visually', 'well-made', 'exploration', 'slice', 'humanity', 'may', 'not', 'accomplish', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'contextually', 'still', 'worthy', 'film', 'deserving', 'credence', 'BElysium', 'rated', 'R', 'refreshingly', 'appropriate', 'running', 'time', '1', 'hour', '37', 'minutes', 'not', 'near', 'masterpiece', 'sci-fi', 'was', 'District', '9', 'Elysium', 'good', 'summer', 'movie', 'great', 'example', 'visionary', 'directing']",N/A
1555528,A1Y2GZGBMICFG8,B008JFUN50,The Separator,"[0, 2]","&#34;Bring down the bone saw!&#34; - One of the best films of the year.Within the overall ranking of great film, there is a sub-section of great reserved for awesome Sci-Fi, the rarest of all great. This blog will begin with a review of such a film.Having just seen Elysium I am more probably more envious of director Niell Blomkamp than any other person in the world right now. Besides the fact that Blomkamp&#8217;s now two feature films are fantastic, his other film is District Nine, he&#8217;s only 33 and he operates as a visionary in the Sci-Fi genre, a genre where visionaries are in urgent demand.In 2154 Earth&#8217;s wealthiest have abandoned the filthy scourge that has become our home planet and taken up residence on Elysium, a Garden of Eden type space station equipped with ultra-advanced medical technology. It&#8217;s all just a quick shuttle ride away from Earth. Close enough to be realistic, but just outside the reach of masses.Matt Damon plays Max, a heavily tattooed former criminal trying to get this life back on the straight and narrow, but the Los Angeles of 2154 where he resides makes it difficult. After a run of bad luck he is dealt a deadly dose of radiation while working at his factory job. From here Max&#8217;s only chance of survival is to get to Elysium. Conveniently, Max just happens to be on a first name basis with Spider, a mastermind hacker crime boss that has the means to get Max there. After an unpleasant scene were Max is fused to with a robotic exoskeleton all he needs to do to attain his passage is hijack a corrupt official&#8217;s brain and download the data to his own.The dismal picture that Blomkamp paints of our future as a species is grim, although slightly glorified. His Los Angeles 2154 resembles the favelas of current day Rio de Janerio, hardly a fictional dystopia, and although Damon is a pleasure to watch amidst this dystopian fiction, his overall goal of trying to save his own life is not enough to garner sympathy. It is difficult to care about the worth of a single ex-con&#8217;s life amidst the pandemonium and violence that everyone around him also suffers.This disconnect never really resolves itself despite an attempt: Max ends up trying to save his childhood friend, and her daughter too. It doesn&#8217;t work, but it also doesn&#8217;t matter. This film is about wholes, big pictures, sums of all things greater than the individual. The technological marvels of Elysium are matched only by the decrepitude of the world that Blomkamp creates. A statement has been made loudly about humanity&#8217;s potential trajectory, lest we decide to alter it.More reviews at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",5,Best Sci-Fi of 2013 hands down.,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,2672,"['34', 'Bring', 'down', 'bone', 'saw', '34', 'One', 'best', 'films', 'year.Within', 'overall', 'ranking', 'great', 'film', 'sub-section', 'great', 'reserved', 'awesome', 'Sci-Fi', 'rarest', 'great', 'blog', 'will', 'begin', 'review', 'such', 'film.Having', 'just', 'seen', 'Elysium', 'am', 'more', 'probably', 'more', 'envious', 'director', 'Niell', 'Blomkamp', 'other', 'person', 'world', 'right', 'now', 'fact', 'Blomkamp', '8217', 's', 'now', 'two', 'feature', 'films', 'are', 'fantastic', 'other', 'film', 'District', 'Nine', '8217', 'only', '33', 'visionary', 'Sci-Fi', 'genre', 'genre', 'where', 'visionaries', 'are', 'urgent', 'demand.In', '2154', 'Earth', '8217', 'wealthiest', 'have', 'abandoned', 'filthy', 'scourge', 'become', 'home', 'planet', 'taken', 'up', 'residence', 'Elysium', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'type', 'space', 'station', 'equipped', 'ultra-advanced', 'medical', 'technology', '8217', 's', 'just', 'quick', 'shuttle', 'ride', 'away', 'Earth', 'Close', 'enough', 'be', 'realistic', 'just', 'reach', 'masses.Matt', 'Damon', 'Max', 'heavily', 'tattooed', 'former', 'criminal', 'trying', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'straight', 'narrow', 'Los', 'Angeles', '2154', 'where', 'difficult', 'run', 'bad', 'luck', 'dealt', 'deadly', 'dose', 'radiation', 'working', 'factory', 'job', 'here', 'Max', '8217', 'only', 'chance', 'survival', 'get', 'Elysium', 'Conveniently', 'Max', 'just', 'be', 'first', 'name', 'basis', 'Spider', 'mastermind', 'hacker', 'crime', 'boss', 'means', 'get', 'Max', 'there', 'unpleasant', 'scene', 'were', 'Max', 'fused', 'robotic', 'exoskeleton', 'do', 'attain', 'passage', 'corrupt', 'official', '8217', 'brain', 'download', 'data', 'own.The', 'dismal', 'picture', 'Blomkamp', 'paints', 'future', 'species', 'grim', 'slightly', 'glorified', 'Los', 'Angeles', '2154', 'favelas', 'current', 'day', 'Rio', 'Janerio', 'hardly', 'fictional', 'dystopia', 'Damon', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'amidst', 'dystopian', 'fiction', 'overall', 'goal', 'trying', 'save', 'own', 'life', 'not', 'enough', 'garner', 'sympathy', 'difficult', 'care', 'worth', 'single', 'ex-con', '8217', 's', 'life', 'pandemonium', 'violence', 'everyone', 'also', 'suffers.This', 'disconnect', 'never', 'really', 'attempt', 'Max', 'up', 'trying', 'save', 'childhood', 'friend', 'daughter', 'too', '8217', 't', 'work', 'also', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'matter', 'film', 'wholes', 'big', 'pictures', 'sums', 'things', 'greater', 'individual', 'technological', 'marvels', 'Elysium', 'are', 'matched', 'only', 'decrepitude', 'world', 'Blomkamp', 'statement', 'been', 'made', 'loudly', 'humanity', '8217', 'potential', 'trajectory', 'decide', 'alter', 'it.More', 'reviews', 'getthebonesaw.blogspot.com']",N/A

1555532,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B008JFUN50,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[8, 14]","I fell in love with Neill Blomkamp's first film ""District 9""; the South African filmmaker's take on a sci-fi film was really brilliant and shows how a filmmaker with a unique storytelling voice can create something new and exciting. It was an eye-opening experience and even more remarkable because it was the filmmaker's first full-length feature.His second film ""Elysium"" is not quite as ground-breaking or original, but it does add a unique voice, making it a more interesting sci-fi film. In a less talented director's hands, ""Elysium"" would be a routine sci-fi programmer, the type of film quickly forgotten and relegated to endless cable runs. But Blomkamp's vision and style help ensure that ""Elysium"" will be remembered as a highlight of the summer.Los Angeles in 2154 is an overpopulated, toxicly polluted, dry and brown landscape in which people toil at meaningless jobs and struggle to survive. Yes, I said 2154 and not 2013. The working class is essentially stuck on Earth in what is a police state. The rich and wealthy live on a space station that looks like Beverly Hills and comes complete with machines able to heal any sickness or ailment. The people on Earth make attempts to board Elysium, to take advantage of the healing machines, but Delacourt (Jodie Foster), the head of Defense, quickly orders these errant spaceships shot down. Back on Earth, Max (Matt Damon) gets involved in an accident at work and becomes irradiated. He soon learns he has five days to live. Struggling to figure out how to survive, he meets mercenaries who offer to help him; they will strap a metal framework to his body and use intelligence stolen from Carlyle (William Fichtner) to get past Elysium's security network. As Max struggles with these preparations (the framework is physically attached to his body), he reconnects with Frey (Alice Braga), a girl he grew up with in an orphanage. She now has a daughter who is sick and about to die, giving Max even more reason to get to Elysium. But Delacourt also has a rogue warrior, Kruger (Sharlito Copley), in her pocket and enlists him to stop Max and help her restore order.Written and directed by Blomkamp, the narrative of ""Elysium"" is presented in an economical way, which keeps the story moving and holds your interest. There is a very brief intro before we watch an unauthorized shuttle approach the space station. We watch Delacourt go into action and then focus on Max back on Earth. Max labors through every day, much like the other people living in Los Angeles, but he does what he has to do and tries to remain positive about everything. We quickly learn about his living situation, his job, what life is like in this Los Angeles. It isn't great. A lot of sci-fi films run over two hours and this is usually attributed to the set-up and backstory necessary to get us involved in the story. Blomkamp doesn't stop the narrative to give us details, he gives us the details as part of the narrative. It is so much more engaging to learn these things as the story unfolds - because so much is happening, we pay closer attention and enjoy the finer points of this filmmaker's work.Max lives in a little shack in the middle of an even more run-down part of town. This is the part of town run by Spider (Wagner Moura), the man behind constant attempts to get sick people up to Elysium for treatment. He finally comes up with a plan and Max is the key. But Max is a reluctant hero and takes some convincing. When he decides to help Spider out, the process proves to be painful, continuously forcing Max to prove his determination to help. Watching Max's journey also propels us further into his universe and life.There are a lot of things going on in ""Elysium"". Spider wants to get sick people to the space station, to receive treatment. This is a driving force in his life. But he also wants to get people up there - any people - to help break the exclusivity of this place, to smash the class barrier. He uses one obsession as a mask for another.Matt Damon's Max is an interesting reluctant hero. Max seems happy to be just surviving. In fact, after he has an accident and work and receives a dire prognosis, his desire to continue living drives him to take the next steps to help Spider and become part of his team. Throughout the journey we share with Max, we learn about him and his view of life, we see a few moments he shared with Frey when they were kids, moments that foreshadow who they will both become. It is a surprisingly complex character and Damon brings a lot to the role.Jodie Foster plays Delacourt, the head of security for Elysium. She is a steely woman who doesn't seem to think twice about ordering a shuttle of Earth refugees shot down before it reaches Elysium. Her focus is to keep the people of Elysium safe and her focus never wavers. Even when the President questions her and threatens to reprimand her, she seems to consider these to be minor inconveniences and continues forward with her duties, never missing a step. In fact, the threat of a reprimand only serves to make her take the next step in her plan.Sharlito Copley plays Kruger, a mercenary under the thumb of Delacourt, willing and able to do whatever it takes to fulfill his responsibilities. Copley, the star of ""District 9"", adds a unique character to the film. As soon as Kruger sees the power shifting, he takes advantage of the situation to the best of his ability. And this allows Copley to really allow Kruger to become larger than life. He is almost a human version of the Terminator, pursuing his goals with an unhuman tenacity.The fact that the name of the space station Elysium - where all of the rich and privileged live, and where they have no worries, no sickness - is borrowed from Greek mythology adds another level of interest to the film and shows the creativity of Blomkamp. It goes back to that 'unique storyteller' thing I was talking about earlier. Let's face it, many won't get the reference - many writers and directors probably wouldn't - so when a filmmaker does, you sit up and take notice. Everyone wanted to go to the Elysium Fields, paradise, like heaven, to be with family and friends, to never get sick again. The Elysium in this film is remarkably similar to Beverly Hills - large estates, predominately white marble, lots of green spaces. The only difference is the slight curve to the landscape to reflect the curve in the space station.Once Max and Kruger arrive at Elysium, the film falters a bit and becomes more conventional. They battle each other, fighting to the death. It is a well-orchestrated fight, but it doesn't offer a lot of new visual material for us to savor, material that Blomkamp has already earned a reputation for.The entire final act falters slightly, veering very close to a routine sci-fi conclusion. This is disappointing because everything up to that point is really good, memorable and interesting.Blomkamp is a skilled craftsman, capable of creating a unique moviegoing experience. I hope he continues to use his skill, his voice, to create many, many more films to come.",4,"Blomkamp's Follow-Up to ""District 9""",1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,7080,"['fell', 'love', 'Neill',

1555536,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B008JFUN50,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[8, 18]","This is a flick I probably would have never seen. I like Matt Damon, and Jodie Foster is worth seeing. But I saw it BECAUSE the drug addict of the AM waves said it was ""leftie,"" you know, dem Hollywood libruls making it look like there are two class tiers, one of them better off than the other. And, of course, that couldn't be true, right?I should point out that there might be a few spoilers here, but I don't know how to review it without 'em. So, here goes.Matt Damon was brought up in Los Angeles in the late 21st century. Here on earth there are people living on top of each other. Conditions are ghastly, jobs are scarce and terrible. And health care is nonexistent. But in space is a large space station, Elysium, on which the wealthy live. There health care is...well, everything has been cured. That's among the problems I had with the script. There is an ""underground"" on earth which tries to smuggle miserable earthlings to Elysium for their health. The Secretary of Defense, Delacourte (Jodie Foster) casually shoots down the shuttles carrying the earthlings. There are apparently regulations prohibiting such behavior, but Foster disregards them, to the chagrin of President Patel (interesting, a president of Indian heritage, from the merchant class.)A woman on whom Max (Matt Damon) has a crush when they were much younger, sees Max in the hospital. She, however, has a daughter who's terminally ill with leukemia. That, of course, feeds into part of the story.Max eventually has to risk his life on his job, or risk losing it. Of course, something goes wrong, and he's given but a few days to live. So he goes back to his former buddies in the underworld, and demands that he go to Elysium...to make a long story short.This is where the story gets a little to super-hero like, and hard to take. These thugs operate on him, adding hardware to make his body all but invincible. In the meantime, Delacourte arranges a coup d'&eacute;tat via this military thug, Kruger (Sharlto Copley) who has such a criminal reputation that he's dismissed BEFORE she hires him to do her dirtiest of work.Well, I don't want to give away too much. In the tradition of ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits,"" points were made with the story, especially those of class distinctions, and despicable records of military professionals. One problem I had was with Jodie Foster's accent: What was it? And what was the point of it? It sounded like she was trying to sound like she's graduated from the Elysium finishing school. And I won't give away anything of her fate. It did NOT end ""they all lived happily after."" It was, however, quite violent. Kruger has his face blown off in an altercation, but the medicine on Elysium rebuilt his face. Then he was also give enough hardware to make himself all but invincible. So, somewhat predictably, he and Max fought it out, and fought it out, and fought it out. NOTE: NO give away there either.The film was all right. As a person who's spent a great deal of time in terribly crowded places on earth, I acknowledge more than most the issue of overpopulation. And I do see the class descrepancies that become great. So I can see that issue too. And the special effects and set were outstanding. But it was a bit too much of a superhero sentimentality. Enjoy it, but don't expect a whole lot of intellectual stimulation. And, Rush, if you'd have kept your trap shut, I probably wouldn't have seen it. So you're the idiot...as anyone sane has always known...",4,First movie I ever saw because Limbaugh whined about it!,1378166400,"09 3, 2013",2013,3495,"['flick', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'like', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'worth', 'seeing', 'saw', 'drug', 'addict', 'AM', 'waves', 'said', 'was', 'leftie', 'know', 'dem', 'Hollywood', 'libruls', 'making', 'look', 'are', 'two', 'class', 'tiers', 'one', 'better', 'other', 'course', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'true', 'right', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'might', 'be', 'few', 'spoilers', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'review', 'So', 'here', 'goes.Matt', 'Damon', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'late', '21st', 'century', 'Here', 'earth', 'are', 'people', 'living', 'top', 'other', 'Conditions', 'are', 'ghastly', 'jobs', 'are', 'scarce', 'terrible', 'health', 'care', 'nonexistent', 'space', 'large', 'space', 'station', 'Elysium', 'wealthy', 'live', 'health', 'care', 'well', 'everything', 'been', 'cured', 'problems', 'had', 'script', 'underground', 'earth', 'smuggle', 'miserable', 'earthlings', 'Elysium', 'health', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'Delacourte', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'casually', 'shoots', 'down', 'shuttles', 'carrying', 'earthlings', 'are', 'apparently', 'regulations', 'prohibiting', 'such', 'behavior', 'Foster', 'disregards', 'chagrin', 'President', 'Patel', 'interesting', 'president', 'Indian', 'heritage', 'merchant', 'class', 'woman', 'whom', 'Max', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'crush', 'when', 'were', 'much', 'younger', 'Max', 'hospital', 'however', 'daughter', 'who', 'terminally', 'ill', 'leukemia', 'course', 'feeds', 'part', 'story.Max', 'eventually', 'risk', 'life', 'job', 'risk', 'losing', 'course', 'something', 'wrong', 'given', 'few', 'days', 'live', 'back', 'former', 'buddies', 'underworld', 'go', 'Elysium', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short.This', 'where', 'story', 'little', 'super-hero', 'hard', 'take', 'thugs', 'operate', 'adding', 'hardware', 'make', 'body', 'invincible', 'meantime', 'Delacourte', 'coup', 'd', 'eacute', 'military', 'thug', 'Kruger', 'Sharlto', 'Copley', 'who', 'criminal', 'reputation', 'dismissed', 'do', 'dirtiest', 'work.Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'tradition', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'points', 'were', 'made', 'story', 'especially', 'class', 'distinctions', 'despicable', 'records', 'military', 'professionals', 'One', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'accent', 'What', 'was', 'was', 'point', 'sounded', 'was', 'trying', 'sound', 'graduated', 'Elysium', 'finishing', 'school', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'anything', 'fate', 'did', 'NOT', 'end', 'lived', 'happily', 'was', 'however', 'quite', 'violent', 'Kruger', 'face', 'blown', 'off', 'altercation', 'medicine', 'Elysium', 'rebuilt', 'face', 'Then', 'was', 'also', 'give', 'enough', 'hardware', 'make', 'invincible', 'So', 'somewhat', 'predictably', 'Max', 'fought', 'out', 'fought', 'out', 'fought', 'out', 'NOTE', 'give', 'away', 'either.The', 'film', 'was', 'right', 'person', 'who', 'spent', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'terribly', 'crowded', 'places', 'earth', 'acknowledge', 'more', 'most', 'issue', 'overpopulation', 'do', 'see', 'class', 'become', 'great', 'can', 'see', 'issue', 'too', 'special', 'effects', 'set', 'were', 'outstanding', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'superhero', 'sentimentality', 'Enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'whole', 'lot', 'intellectual', 'stimulation', 'Rush', ""'d"", 'have', 'kept', 'trap', 'shut', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'seen', ""'re"", 'idiot', 'anyone', 'sane', 'always', 'known']",N/A

1555539,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B008JFUN50,Todd Smith,"[1, 2]","From the Writer/Director of District 9, comes Elysium, a futuristic tale that focuses on the inequality of wealth. Much like in his first film, Neill Blomkamp is examining a modern problem with a futuristic story, and once again, he isn't offering any solutions. As with District 9, Blomkamp is showing how an unsolved issue, left to it's own devices, will eventually cause chaos. In 2154, Earth is overpopulated and in ruins. The rich have built a utopian society on the largest space station ever conceived, and as you may have guessed, it's called Elysium. The story focuses on Max, an orphan and ex-con, who has always dreamed of living in paradise on Elysium. His plans to earn his way take a dramatic turn, when he is injured in an accident at work. Max knows he'll never survive on Earth and the only way to save his life is to get some of the advanced medical treatment available on Elysium. The two stories are very different, but the setting could have been exactly the same. The story itself was pretty good, there was a lot more action then in District 9, yet the similarities are unmistakable. Matt Damon stars and played the role he was asked to play. Max had a lot of potential to be an interesting character, perhaps one with an agenda, instead he was written as this dumb guy, who was anything but a savior to the people of Earth. Max was out to save himself and did what was necessary to survive, but he should have been more. The people all turned to Max to help solve a greater problem, but all he cared about was himself. Jodie Foster also stars, but has a surprisingly small role, that definitely did not fit her personality.

People on Elysium have it all, top of the line everything, including machines that can heal any ailment a human could have. People on earth basically have nothing. You get the picture. The plot is extremely predictable and shallow. Too many flashbacks.  As another reviewer stated, you can figure out how it will end midway through.

Since the beginning and endings were in Spanish with subtitles and the people on Elysium itself spoke French on occasion, that was a distraction. Those sections were muffled so the spoken words were unintelligible as if perhaps the filmmakers didn't want the audience to actually hear what was being spoken. Those viewing the movie with me spent a good deal of time raising and lowering the volume.  In the same way, the male villain of the piece had such a thick Cockney (?) accent, almost all of what he said couldn't be understood. As for the story itself, there are a couple of explanatory sentences splashed on the screen and then we're into it.  Folks on Earth living in squalor while the rich, as are their wont, frolic in a space station paradise called Elysium.  The habitat has machines which can cure any ill and those on Earth will do anything to get there and cure themselves and their love ones. When Max, ex-con and assembly line worker accidentally gets exposed to a terminal dose of radiation, getting to Elysium becomes his goal. After he discovers the daughter of his friend and fellow orphan also is dying, he swears to save the child, too. And thereby hangs the plot...Max's attempts with criminal friends to use a stolen computer program implanted in his head to sabotage Elysium so everyone will have access to it. Jodie Foster is great as the female villain--cold, calculating, practically emotionless--quite different from her other roles. She'll become the woman you'll love to hate and may even cheer when she gets hers.As usual in SF, it's the special effects which star but in spite of that, the whole thing seems to lack something and I can't figure out what. Some other emotion than resentment, anger, and fear perhaps...a little &#34;human&#34; caring, a little more depth?  Perhaps more detail on the characters' lives?

The nitty-gritty world of Earth was consistently well-developed with much attention to small details to make it feel real. It is was depressing and dark, but believable. Elysium was done in the same manner but on the opposite side of the spectrum.The storyline was overall very good. It moved at a good clip, kept me engaged, and I found no inconsistencies that snagged the flow of things. But...one scene towards the end, the big 'fight scene', dragged on and on and I started losing interest. It came together once past that scene, but I was disappointed to find the big, climatic battle rather lackluster. I can't pinpoint why it didn't grab me, as it seemed to have all the elements it should. Perhaps it's that it went on too long.The movie is very well cast, but Jodie Foster has this uppity accent that I didn't care for.

After Django Unchained made people cringe of its racial politics and extreme violence and after The Purge unsettled people to think that it sucked and a scenario involving government-approved mass murder could happen, Elysium is the newest entry in the battlefield metaphorically representing issues of classism, immigration, poverty, healthcare, and government-assited marital law and assassinations that all resemble a current nasty picture of America (especially California's US-Mexico border, Arizona, and Texas), Brazil (especially with the recent 2013 Rio de Janiero protests and favela slums), Mexico, China, Thailand, Syria, Egypt, and many other countries with similar issues.Elysium examines Max da Costa, an orphan child raised to believe the titled place known as Elysium was a safe haven and it was possible to go not knowing he would live a life of poverty, seedy crime, overpopulation, and health problems. There is so many things to discuss here but for the sake of Amazon reviews, what is important to know here are the themes itself and how they relate to the current day.For a liberal though, this is a nightmare and an orgasm but for a conservative, this is a flaky, Hollywood-funded, hypocritical propaganda piece. However you see it, the film does not disappoint but it does skim a few lines from its similarly thematic and violence-driven sister film, District 9, an allegory about South African apartheid but making the film's premise a little more general, relying more on action, and slimming down the element of creativity with a narrative that is striking but a bit similar to films like Soylent Green, Children of Men, ZPG, or Brave New World.It does strike several accords, in addition, with its practical and virtuoso special effects (spearheaded by Neill Blomkamp himself), Matt Damon playing a believable yet sickly role as Max in his funky exoskeleton costume, and a darkly humourous and vicious role from District 9 actor Sharlto Copley as a rogue bounty hunter. While I am quite critical of the sci-fi genre, the science fiction represented here has some aura of believability (that is the themes and setting on Earth) and superficiality in the narrative where space is the next frontier and so are fast-moving spacecraft, mechanical chip-inserts that collect people's data in their brain, and robotic law enforcement which is all fun but does suffer a bit. District 9 had similar problems too but had a more believable, historically-significant narrative and credibility to it.Then again, Elysium was not a film I was waiting to see but it did slip in the radar a bit by chance after I got the jist of its themes, narrative, and action. On that weekend, We're the Millers looked a bit tired, Planes was not really a Pixar production so I skipped it for a later time, and Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters was just never a film I cared to see after the first film was just contrived drivel.Despite some of its downfalls, it is still an ambitious effort on Blomkamp, Damon, and others partaking in this film. It was dark, intense, melancholic (dealt with a child having leukemia and in need of assistance), graphically violent (lots of body parts exploding, not for the faint-of-heart), and humanising (when you know that Max's ambition was sacrifice in the name for everyone who has worked and survived or is in need of help). It is an R-rated film with heart and that is something you will not find very often and it was engaging and not deliberately brutal or offensive.Even if some find discomfort in all of this, just remember, what would you do for a loved one or for a child you know has felt sickly or in pain? Would you, if you had the money or not, take to emergency quickly or leave to die under selfish reasons? Think about that.""",4,Debatable and dense futuristic film speaks volumes and brings plenty of action.

Elysium falls far short of District 9, but still manages to be a very good movie.  I am a complete sucker for a good sci-fi Dystopian future-type film including such films as Blade Runner and yes, even the Mad Max stuff.  Some critics have complained that Elysium is too ""political"" and reeks of ""Marxism"" and other claims.  Certainly, Elysium comes at us with a particular political and world-view which is, in my opinion, not so far off from the current social situation: the separation and division between the haves and have-nots.  Elysium simply examines and explores this social reality and carries it to it's extreme.  That is it's primary plot device.  It is not so absurd as it seems when you examine human history.  As ridiculous as the entire Nazi attempt to annihilate an entire people was, it did happen. And that is but one example of some of the strange notions that float about in the human heart from certain people who would have and control it all.  So we are dealing in the realm of probability here, not just with some odd, off-the-wall absurdity.That being said, Elysium does suffer from some actual absurdities itself, often going way over-the-top with certain things.  I failed to buy into the robot cops who control the have-not populace.  I also failed to buy into the development of those ""magical"" devices of the haves that can seemingly diagnose and cure any kind of disease, such as leukemia, within a couple of minutes simply by lying down in it.  The entire exo-skeleton human enhancement device that is implanted onto our hero, Matt Damon, which becomes one strong factor in allowing him to beat up bad guys seems all wrong and ridiculous.  But now I'm getting nit-picking.  The real questions are:  is Elysium worth taking your time to watch and is Elysium a good movie?  My response is an absolute unqualified yes!  If you are a fan of dystopian sci-fi movies like I am, I think you will enjoy it.  If you have a rigid political viewpoint that finds any notion of a separation of classes based on wealth offensive or the introduction of any political viewpoint into your movies, then I wouldn't bother watching it.As for me, I enjoyed Elysium in spite of the fact that it is far from a great movie.

Jody Fosters character starts extreme and goes further from there.""add some layers"" if you like, to both Damon and Foster's characters, not a lot, just a wee bit more would have been nice.Sharlto Copley of District 9 fame is also a significant part of this movie and while his character rises well above both Matt Damon's & Foster in being the most memorable it's not because of what he was given but in what he does with it, his role requires the least amount of depth yet I got the impression I knew him better than the rest by the end.this movie had 2 hours to tell a story... a really strong story that could have built a strong emotional tie to the audience and while it doesn't waste it (too harsh a word), Elysium does squander several opportunities that would/could have made it epic.if I was to condense Elysium down to one impression, it'd be ""rushed.""it wasn't for lack of time that it came across as rushed but much more in the choices made regarding characters relationship & interaction that ate up valuable time that could have been used differently.I liked the movie, it's a solid 3 of 5 stars and I'd be really interested in seeing an extended version if only to see if Elysium had heart that was lost during editing.",3,"decent, a brief introduction & character build leave it uneven.",1377561600,"08 27, 2013",2013,1771,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'more', 'wife', 'regardless', 'decent/entertaining', 'not', 'compelling.Matt', 'Damon', 'protagonist', 'film', 'start', 'learn', 'loyal', 'wild', 'streak', 'been', 'way', 'childhood', 'movie', 'character', 'process', 'rebooting', 'life', 'following', 'mishap.it', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'know', 'where', 'skill', 'set', 'came', 'cppl', 'side', 'comments', 'also', 'never', 'get', 'clear', 'grasp', 'how', 'situation', 'Earth', 'Elysium', 'degraded', 'current', 'level', 'Jody', 'Fosters', 'character', 'extreme', 'further', 'there', 'add', 'layers', 'like', 'Damon', 'Foster', 'characters', 'not', 'lot', 'just', 'wee', 'bit', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice.Sharlto', 'Copley', 'District', '9', 'fame', 'also', 'significant', 'part', 'movie', 'character', 'well', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Foster', 'being', 'most', 'memorable', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'what', 'role', 'least', 'amount', 'depth', 'yet', 'got', 'impression', 'knew', 'better', 'rest', 'end.this', 'movie', 'had', '2', 'hours', 'tell', 'story', 'really', 'strong', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'built', 'strong', 'emotional', 'tie', 'audience', ""n't"", 'waste', 'too', 'word', 'Elysium', 'squander', 'several', 'opportunities', 'would/could', 'have', 'made', 'epic.if', 'was', 'condense', 'Elysium', 'down', 'one', 'impression', ""'d"", 'be', 'rushed', 'was', ""n't"", 'lack', 'time', 'came', 'rushed', 'much', 'more', 'choices', 'made', 'regarding', 'characters', 'relationship', 'interaction', 'ate', 'up', 'valuable', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'differently.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'solid', '3', '5', 'stars', ""'d"", 'be', 'really', 'interested', 'seeing', 'extended', 'version', 'only', 'see', 'Elysium', 'had', 'heart', 'was', 'lost', 'editing']",N/A

And, if actors are anything like human beings, the best bring the rest up to their level. Not meaning to give co-stars less than their due, I'm sure it happened here. Add in a dramatic script with all the right elements (evil uber-class, downtrodden masses, underground movement poised to strike) and it just gets better. Then pour buckets of money into effects. You're going to see something good come out of the pipeline, and this time you surely do. Action, underdogs become overlords, and gross social inequality undone. Pass the popcorn and it's all good.What's not: Well, plausibility. The minute overclass living on the backs of vast numbers of serfs - well, it's been true, or has acquired enough truthiness to pass casual inspection.

Why is that a bad thing?  1984 by Orwell doesn't either, but it's a classic, thought-provoking story.  And, like this film, its message actually applies.  It's an admonition.Here's the thing: the rich have reserved all of the best facilities, security, property, amenities, and  . . . the entire government.  They guard it with deadly force.  They horde it with alacrity.No, I am not describing modern America.  I am giving you the setting in which this movie's main character operates.  Those who have, have everything.  Those without are desperately trying to get what they need.  In particular, the cruelty of this future world is that medical options are only given to the rich who live in space.By the way, the rich are mostly white and the president is Indian.  The poor are mostly Hispanic and . . . Matt Damon.  Well, there are whites and blacks too, but you'll see an obvious racial ratio that might be meant as another overt message about today's immigration battles.Still, the movie is a quick-paced action film with a lot of heart.  Quite a few times you wonder how the main character is going to survive.  The story is about the human struggle that we still have not progressed beyond--our inability to SHARE like mommy taught us and live for the greater good FIRST.The hero is an unlikely, unwilling participant thrown into a struggle for his life.  Soon it is a struggle for others' lives.  It is a tale of violence and sacrifice worth watching at least once.  Plus it has some really cool sci-fi tech and effects!

Uneducated orphan boy who day dreams with an orphan girl, who is educated(why her and not him?), about the good life up on Elysium. Both kids, and others, raised by the prophetic Mexican nun whose words are always profound and perspective changing.Later in life, the boy is Matt Damon and the girl is some semi-attractive single mom that seems to not want anything to do with him.
