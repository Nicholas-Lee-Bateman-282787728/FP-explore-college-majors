If any of you remember the yahoo film reviewers on the old SCTV comedy show, Big Bob McSomething and Billy Saul Hurrock, I think?  They rated films highly based on the number of excrutiating explosions.  Well those boys would have really liked Vertical Limit.  And, yes, people do get blowed up, blowed up real good, with nitro.Not that it is a totally bad film.  The scenery is beautiful, but then again it is the high Himaliyas.  The characters are corny and caricatures of those EXTREME types you see all summer.  You know, always running, biking, climbing, yada, yada, yada.  Scott Glenn as the zen mountain man pondering savior of them all is almost comical.

Their paths meet when Annie prepares to join a billionare on a climb on K - 2, the 2nd highest peak of the world, but far more dangerous than its better known & higher sibling, the Everest.As to be expected - a storm strikes, some climbers are killed, others survive but are trapped in a cave somewhere, and have to make tough decisions, such as whether to bother helping a fellow climber who is still alive but is very badly wounded.At the same time, brother Peter tries to organize a rescue mission that should be impossible, with a group of people that have their own story & history to motivate them to climb to the rescue with a pack of unstable nytroglycerine on their backs...Well, as many other reviewrs probably mentioned - this is far from being a masterpiece. The plot is cliched & predictable, the characters shallow (and even more predictable than the plot), and many factual mistakes were probably made.On the other hand, not one promised this movie was a masterpiece.

Yeah, in the end `Vertical Limit' isn't `that' bad, but it's not that good either.Visually, I really enjoyed this.  The scow covered mountain range is gorgeous, and it really presents a formidable foe for the protagonists here.  It's slick and beautiful yet deceptively dangerous.  On the big screen it translates marvelously.  The action/adventure aspect of the film is played up well, and there are certainly a fair share of breathtaking sequences that will linger in your mind (I'm still captivated by that scene of Chris O'Donnell flying through the air with ice picks in each hand).But, there is that pesky script.The clich&eacute;s never let up here.  You have a brother and sister who are haunted by a fatal climb that cost them their father.  The sister plunges herself into the mountains and becomes a famous climber.  The brother runs from the mountains and becomes a National Geographic photographer.  When his sister takes a creepy millionaire up on K2 and gets lost, the brother chases after her on his own rescue mission, since the weather is so bad no one else will go.The acting is fare at best, but it is the scenery and the break-neck direction that keep this boat afloat.

Yeah, I know, it's classic Hollywood fiction and the old ""hold the audience"" and ""build the tension and excitement"" kind of thing but hey, even in pure unadulterated 'hold the audience/build the excitement' fiction, and with Sci-Fi, Fantasy and Horror genre flicks aside, at 'least' make the adventure fiction film and plot half-way believable and don't de facto take the audience for a bunch of folks allegedly looking for a cross between 'Star Wars' and some shoot-em-up video game come to life! Whew!As for whoever came up with the nitro thing as the ""cure"" [!?] for solving the crevasse trapped problem or those wild hand/feet moves in a sort of rope and ice axe follies kind of thing [and 'this' after being airlifted  to an altitude where, in real life, the whole party would have been finished forthwith since even the best of the best when it comes to high altitude tolerance and endurance MUST first acclimatize and this takes 'weeks', not hours!] , anyway, the nitro 'cure' had to be the icing on the farce, as it were, and I would hardly suggest that this was a movie for, as one reviewer put it, the ""REI crowd"" [sic] as much as for the ""Yo! Gimme some action, man, ANY action, especially those visuals"" crowd.And this too, on the personal side -- the cameo of real-life and world class climber, Doc Ed Viesturs, where his 'Hollywood' scripted line in the movie is scripted along the lines of, ""You don't send six to rescue two"" [during a mountain storm] yet was it not Doc Viesturs [** Ed holds a DVM credential] ET AL who in real life was there on Everest in '96 when Doc Beck Weathers [** see my review of the Everest 1996 IMAX film] needed the helping hand getting back to C1 for the helicopter rescue attempt! And got it! As for K2 itself, it's hardly literary rhetoric that gives K2 the moniker of 'savage' and/or 'killer' mountain as its most recent victims [11 climbers] tragically demonstrated on August 1, 2008 when, besides climber falls, a serac fell.

It's amazing how thin the air is above ten thousand feet, much less twenty thousand. Above ten thousand I get slightly nauseous and can't quite get my breath just walking.

What kind of cardboard are these metal canisters made of?As you may have gathered by now, &quot;Verticle Limit&quot; has some definite weaknesses. In general, the story is very predictable, but it is helped by lots of beautiful, though cold, scenery and some taut (whether believable or not) action sequences. The actors are giving it their all, but the lack of any real headliners doesn't help, either. Put this all together and you have a very mediocre flick.

Yet this is an experience without a real story, with characters bumping into each other and the furniture, to twist Spencer Tracy's sage advice about what acting is all about. Chris O'Donnell's character is all over the place, brooding, remorseful, a somewhat milquetoast character who somehow seems to be quite sure of himself all at the same time. His sister, on the other hand, seems to suffer from some terrible form of terminal emotional constipation, yet she is supposedly acting out some emotional psycho-drama inspired in large part by her sainted dead father's memory. Bill Paxton plays a shady and insipid yuppie type character so shallow his teeth glow in the sunlight, and only Scott Glenn lends any kind of real and authentic acting credibility to this unlikely potboiler.All that said, it still represents a terrific way to spend some quality time gazing at the terrific landscapes, action sequences, and wonderful cinematography that the director continually throws our way, and the action sequences in particular are stunning and very realistic. While anyone familiar with climbing can spot a number of technical errors in both the storyline and the way the accidents and subsequent rescue attempts are depicted, there is a lot in the way this film was made to recommend it in terms of enjoyable movie entertainment.Especially noteworthy was the way the climbing sequences were filmed, which required a lot of technical expertise on the part of the actors, and lent itself well to telling the story through their actions and interactions. And while the plot was so trite and silly as to be laughable, you will find yourself absorbed by the sequence of events depicted and the suspense-filled and breathless pace at which events seem to transpire, crowding each other off the screen for the next sequence.

The plot is simple but enticing. Chris O'Donnell (THE THREE MUSKETEERS,BATMAN FOREVER, BATMAN AND ROBIN) plays a photographer from National Geographic Magazine. His sister is a nationally renowned rock climber who is about to scale K2, one of the most difficult mountains to climb. One of her partners, played by Bill Paxton (TWISTER, TITANIC, U-571), wants to reach the summit in a dangerously low amount of time. When a storm develops 3/4 up the slope, the whole team falls in a crack on the mountain with very little food and water. Chris O'Donnell now must rescue his injured sister before she runs out of supplies. Things become even worse when several of the stranded climbers develop life-threatening illnesses. With a limited number of Dex Shots (Shots given to climbers to fight off most fevers), Chris must find her sister within 2 days, or she will die. My only complaints about this movie are the visuals in the avalanche scene. This scene is shot by combining shots of the actors reacting with shots of real a avalanche. The two shots were not blended well, resulting in an unconvincing storm. However, this is a minor distraction and in no way detracts from the overall movie. The action is breathtaking, and the music fits perfectly with every moment of the film.

Everest. The overall tone is very intense and not to mention scary as h.e.l.l.The acting at times though is a bit hammy especially by Robin Tunney and Chris O'Donnell.

532753,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00003CXQF,D. Litton,"[0, 0]","In the great tradition of disaster movies to come along in the past decade, it's no surprise that one would arrive with a mountain climbing catastrophe. Volcanoes had already erupted in &quot;Dante's Peak&quot; and &quot;Volcano;&quot; &quot;Twister&quot; blew us away to another dimension of movie effects, and &quot;Armageddon&quot; and &quot;Deep Impact&quot; took on the heavy load of the end-of-the-world scenario. &quot;Vertical Limit&quot; takes place in the high altitudes of Pakistan, and let me tell you, it's got more than you think.At the base of the mountain K2, a 28,250-foot peak in the Karakoram Range, a mission is underway to reach the summit of the mountain. The expedition involves Elliot Vaughn, who is using the climb as a publicity stunt for a new airline, Tom McLaren, a renowned mountain climber, and Annie Garrett, who has distanced herself from her brother, Peter. Once the expedition is underway, the group runs into trouble just hours before reaching the summit, falling into a chasm which is closed up by a powerful avalanche.This leaves the people back at the base with the responsibility of rescuing survivors Tom, Annie and Elliot, who will die within an estimated time window of 36 hours. Peter wants more than anything to rescue his sister, fueled by an event from their past involving the death of their father in a climbing accident. He quickly gathers a crew of six people, and they begin making their way up the mountain, nitro explosives in tow.The crew is made up of a diverse group of people. There's Montgomery Wick, who has hidden reasons of his own for attending the search and rescue mission; actor Scott Glenn gives this character a forceful and stern presence which dominates the other characters accordingly. Monique Aubertine is an aspiring nurse who has a taste for danger, and knows her situations well, a trait brought out by actress Izabella Scorupco. Brothers Cyril and Malcom Bench, played by Steve le Marquand and Ben Mendelsohn, aren't given too much screen time, but there performances help to strengthen the belief we have in their bond as kin. And Kareem, played by Alexander Siddig, never ventures from his beliefs by forgetting to pray to his higher power.The more intriguing characters are those trapped in the chasm. Annie Garrett, under the performance of Robin Tunney, has a kick and strength all her own which keeps her pressing on in the face of their impending demise. Nicholas Lea is wonderful as Tom McLaren, the leader-turned-follower who becomes increasingly ill. Both of these characters are seen as being in danger not only from the natural forces around them, but also from their companion, Elliot Vaughn, played by Bill Paxton as a formidable bad guy who will stop at nothing to survive, even if it means another human life.As the race against time begins, the action becomes frantic, sometimes hurtling along at an alarming pace. With a movie such as this, you know you're going to see people hanging off of cliffs and falling from snow banks. Yes, this is a bit old, and we've seen it all before, but anyone who is afraid of heights at all can appreciate the filmmakers' efforts to create a high amount of tension with these situations. The nitro explosions aren't as exciting as the sequences aforementioned, but still are spectacular to watch.The most intriguing aspect of the film, however, is the way in which the drama beneath the snow unfolds. Watching how the trapped survivors react to the realizations that come across them is intriguing, and even more so when we witness the actions they take. There is a strong mix of deceit, perserverance, and suspense that makes this plotline the best of the movie as a whole.There is only one problem I had with the movie. I know they had to have a reason for bringing Scott Glenn's character into the mission, but the story about his wife and the connection she has to Elliot Vaughn seems more like baggage than passable story.

""Vertical Limit"" is a film that has such outstanding action, suspense and photography that its hackneyed story is barely a factor.  The story is about an improbable rescue mission on K2, the second highest mountain on the planet.  While writer Robert King tries weakly to throw some human interest into the screenplay, this film is all Martin Campbell.  Director Campbell is no stranger to the action adventure genre having hit with ""Goldeneye"" and ""Mask of Zorro"".  From a directorial standpoint, this film exceeds both of his previous successes.Filmed in Campbell's native New Zealand, he gives us majestic backdrops and generally beautiful photography.  The action sequences are exciting and the climbing authentic.  All the actors went to climbing school and did most of their own climbing in the film despite never having climbed before.  The film was a logistical nightmare, with equipment and crew having to be flown daily to the mountaintop locations.  Weather constantly trumped the filming schedule and the film ultimate cost a whopping $75 million.  The fact that Campbell was able to complete the film at all was close to miraculous.The acting was good all around.  I have always liked Scott Glenn.  While he doesn't have leading man looks or dynamism, he is one of the most compelling and solid actors around, like a block of granite supporting the leads with the unassuming power of his performances.  He gives another strong performance here as the reclusive guide who leads the rescue mission.  Robin Tunney also did a fine job as the veteran climber who is one of those trapped in the avalanche.  Bill Paxton has always flirted with leading man status, but never really gets the lead.  Here he does a fabulous job rendering a Darwinian character with a malicious coldness befitting the climate on the mountain.  Chris O'Donnell, while adequate in the lead, is really outshined by the rest of the rugged cast.  There is something about him that is just too whiney and cute to qualify him as an action hero.Overall, this is a highly entertaining film with little reason for existence other than the gut wrenching action and suspense.

Peter and his sister Annie are only barely on speaking terms after a tragic accident claims the life of their father while they are all climbing together.  It was Peter's decision to cut a rope that saved the two of them at the cost of their father, and now Annie blames him for it.Fast forward a few years and both of them are coincidentally at K-2 base camp.  Annie is leading a WNN (CNN) news crew to cover the ascent of Elliot Vaughn (Bill Paxton with his usual awful performance with his stupid Bill Paxton acting school voice)a billionaire promoting his new airline.  In the process things go awry and Annie gets trapped in an ice cave.Here is where the ridiculous part comes in.  Peter assembles a team of ""Darwin Award"" winners to climb the mountain and save the survivors.  They take your standard climbing gear along with a tube of Nitro glisorine.  They apparently don't check the containers which turn out to leak.Well once you throw nitro into the mix the action gets pretty explosive.  It is a race against time for the Darwin Crew to get to the top and blow up the mountain (I guess they are not too afraid of physics or avalanches) and save the survivors.  The only disappointing thing about this movie was that no Yeti's either challenged the climbers or helped the survivors out.  Yeah the movie is that outlandish.  Scott GLenn does fill in slightly as the aged climbing guru with a vengeance.Don't take this one serious and will be entertaining.  The funniest part of the whole film after watching it a second time is with the Pakistani Colonel.  He is complaining that he can't properly conduct a war because the climbers are monopolizing the helicopters.

What kills this movie is the plot and the details.  Characters die off for little good reason other than to say, ""Look, mountain climbing is dangerous, particularly when you have sun, heat, and shock-sensitive nitroglycerine on your back!""  Fun factoid: the Pakistani military apparently keeps this stuff on hand for some reason and is happy to lend it out to would-be mountain rescuers.The screenplay is done in typical thriller movie fashion and actually doesn't deviate much from the tried and true formula by drawing the movie out beyond its proper end or other typical blunders.  Basically, a party stranded and in grave danger of death due to freezing, altitude sicknesses, etc., must be rescued; the ambitious leader of the lost party of course cares only for himself and becomes a bad guy really overwhelmed by the antagonist represented by the forces of nature.In the end, parts of the movie supposed to build suspense end up instead giving a few good laughs due to poor execution.

I've considered this a decent popcorn movie that's not going  wow people but not born them to death either. Plus not one you see over-and-over again on cble or dish.Not having the movie at all on DVD gave me a chance to see it in full length in BR format. I won't dive into the story details as it's been put out before but mainly talk about the video and audio presentation in BR format.Video Quality:Off the bat...outstanding. You get a sense of awe of mother nature's glory in the 1:85 presentation. At times you feel like you're watching a National Gepgraphic show with the majestic landscape of mountain range with snow everywhere. With blue skies and rocks covered in snow you get some great contrast of the characters in their ""Bright Winter Outfits"" of yellows, blues, greens & reds. Some of the closeup shots of the characters weathered faces is excellent. Overall the PQ is quite excellent and one that actually will surprise many.Audio Quality:To say I was stunned at the audio presentation would be a slight understatement. I was expecting something with storms and avalanches but not at this level. And it wasn't one or two quick scenes  as you get in many movies but in several instances throughout the film I got thrown in the middle of action. Not too many times the surrounds share equal time with the front stage in a film but with Vertical Limit it did so in a outstanding way. At the 33 minute mark when the rescue team is trying to get off the helicopter in the middle of the storm, the sound puts you right in the middle of it. You're getting wind, snow and the helicopter is buzzing right next to you, front of you and behind you. I must have played the scence five times. Though you don't get a fancy DTS-HD track you still get a solid D.D 5.1 but it's the PCM 5.1 (uncompressed) track that's a ear catcher. It's very robust and really packs a punch providing a solid effort on all channels.yes the movie doesn't have a great storyline though I thought still good enough. But if anything the visual display along with a excellent audio presentation both in action and score should make this worthwhile.

532776,A282SV3AIUE154,B00003CXQF,"K. Feucht ""OncoDoc""","[2, 6]","This is a movie about climbing of K2 by a young brash group of climbers. The main characters are a brother and sister whose father and other family members perished in a family rock climb, which demanded that one of the family members cut the rope to save their life, but lead to the death of the other members of the family. All in all, the only value to this film was nice cinemaphotography. It's deficits are plentiful. There are multiple serious climbing inaccuracies, including a) people don't climb 5-6 people per rope on rock b) people don't have major amounts of flesh exposed with light garments high on K2 c) people don't breath easily for long periods of time in the death zone, d) steroids are not the magic fix for HAPE, e) nobody survives for more than an hour deep in a crevasse, as it's just too cold, etc., etc. The film was produced mostly in New Zealand, which was also quite easy to detect. The plot of the story was quite crazy. Subplots, such as the necessity of carrying large quantities of nitroglycerine to the top of K2 in order to rescue their comrades was stupid.

Bernabo,"[7, 11]","&quot;Vertical Limit&quot; fosters comparisons to &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; because they both start out the same way as the hero, Chris O'Donell as Peter Garrett this time around, faces a fatal mountain climbing accident which makes him swear off such nonsense until circumstances force him to conquer his demons and a bigger, badder mountain.  The mountain in question is K2 and the person he needs to rescue is his estranged sister, Annie (Robin Tunney), who is actually trapped INSIDE the mountain.  This twist is necessary to justify carting volatile nitroglycerine around the mountain for a series of spectacular explosions.  But then everybody with a brain in their head has refused to join in the rescue attempt, leaving it to Peter to take a couple of drunken Aussies who do it because everyone else is too chicken, (Steve Le Marquand and Ben Mendelsohn), the sherpa who is doing it because his cousin is one of those missing on the mountain, (Alexander Siddig), a French-Canadian babe who is doing it for the money (Izabella Scorupco), and the legendary half-crazed mountain climber who has a score to settle with someone (Scott Glenn).  Ultimately &quot;Vertical Limit&quot; is a film where the computer generated special effects overwhelm the cartoon characters, because there really is no reason to care for most of these fools.  The visuals are stunning, the sound track loud, and the melodrama moronic.  I would have thought that mountain climbing could be exciting enough without throwing a &quot;Perils of Pauline&quot; plot into the mix, but I guess I was wrong.  Bill Paxton's billionaire Elliot Vaugh is the obvious villain in the piece, badgering exprienced climbers into going against their better judgments and continuing climbing K2 as a publicity stunt for his new airline.

532783,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00003CXQF,Lawyeraau,"[36, 44]","I love climbing books. I love climbing movies. Therefore, I was thrilled when this movie came out. It is an action packed, edge of your seat, high altitude climbing film. No doubt about it. There is even a cameo appearance by mountaineer Ed Viesters. The only real problem with the film is the plot. It is downright unbelievable, at times. If, however, you can suspend disbelief, you will still enjoy this film. I know that I did.The film revolves around a brother and sister, played by Chris O'Donnell and Robin Tunney, who are estranged following the death of their father while climbing. His death scene is a real nail biter, as it deals with a situation that a climber hopes  never occurs. Three years later, the sister is climbing professionally, while the brother has retired from climbing and is, instead, working as a photographer for National Geographic.He and his sister inadvertently meet up on K2, the second highest peak in the world and probably the most perilous to climb, while he is on assignment for National Geographic, and she is there to climb. The sister is set to climb K2 as part of the climbing team put together by a millionaire played by Bill Paxton. For him, K2 is a trophy mountain, and he plans to climb it with the intention of reaching the summit just as the inaugural flight of the airline he owns is flying overhead. He has put together an ace team, but, alas, K2 has a mind of its own.While climbing, they are overtaken by a storm, after the millionaire disregards his lead climber's warning that the team should turn back. The sister ends up falling into a crevasse. An avalanche kills off the rest of the team, except for the lead climber and the millionaire, who join the sister in the crevasse. Hypoxic and injured, they maintain radio contact with base camp and let them know of their predicament.The brother now steps up to home plate. Organizing a six person, rescue team led by a stereotypic mountain man, wonderfully played by Scott Glenn in a standout performance, the brother sets out to rescue his baby sister, and the fun begins. The climbers each set out with a canister of nitroglycerine, as they plan to set off the nitroglycerine in order to get the three surviving climbers out of the crevasse which has been covered over by the avalanche.Give yourself over to the dazzling mountain views, the stunning, hair raising, mountains madness, and try to ignore the silly plot. Anyone who knows anything about mountains would know that setting off explosives on snow packed slopes is tantamount to an open invitation to avalanche, something no climber wants. Notwithstanding this, get set for an action packed adventure. Despite the silly plot, it is an otherwise entertaining and enjoyable film.If the crunch of crampons on ice is in your blood, if you love the idea of an ice axe saving you from a fall thousands of feet  off a cliff, if the idea of a cornice breaking off, while you are standing on it, is a challenge to your climbing skills, then this is definitely the movie for you. If the words avalanche, hypoxia, and pulmonary edema are all in your everyday vocabulary, then you, too, will enjoy this film. If you just like action packed adventure, make sure you also see this film. I am sure that you will enjoy it.The DVD itself is an excellent value. It comes laden with a number of special features, including a National Geographic special on K2, featuring Jim Wickwire and Rick Ridgeway who, in 1978, along with Lou Reichardt and John Roskelley, were the first Americans ever to reach the summit of K2. The DVD also shows you how some of the stunts in the film were done.

532787,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXQF,Matthew Horner,"[3, 6]","Some critics have complained that the storyline in Vertical Limit is silly. I think they miss the point. This is a thriller, pure and simple, and on that level it is excellent. I think it must be quite difficult to make a movie that both pumps up the audience's adrenaline and tells a meaningful story that makes perfect sense. A few years ago I decided that this kind of picture succeeded if the action didn't totally defy logic, if the excitement was sustained and, if the plot was easy to follow. Vertical Limit easily meets these requirements. So what if the story is banal and absurd? So was Twister's. Such films serve the same purpose as thrill rides, and that purpose has nothing to do with education or enlightenment.The movie opens with a terrifying sequence. Peter [Chris O'Donnell] and his sister, Annie [Robin Tunney], are rock climbing with their Dad. Suddenly, some novice climbers above them fall. In the ensuing melee, the father is killed. Annie blames Peter. Four years later, the siblings are still cool towards each other. Peter has given up climbing and become a nature photographer, but Annie has become a professional mountaineer. Peter runs into her in Pakistan where Annie is working for Elliot Vaughn [Bill Paxton], a billionaire who is obsessed with climbing K-2, the highest mountain in the world. The expedition turns into a disaster when an avalanche sweeps Elliot, Annie and another climber into a cave, where they are trapped. Peter assembles a rescue team, which must endure wind, cold, icy precipices and more avalanches. They take along some nitroglycerine, which proves to be unstable and adds even more danger. If they don't hurry, the stranded trio will die, partly because the oxygen is very thin at 26,000 feet.Admittedly, the plot itself gets very thin at times. For example, why would they take nitroglycerin into an area where avalanches are your worst nightmare? Because this is an action-adventure movie, and such fare demands explosions. To me, the plot holes are inconsequential. Like Jaws, Twister, Independence Day and Armageddon, the story is just on outline to build the action on.It occurred to me while watching Vertical Limit that a viewer's involvement in a thriller increases when the subject matter involves things he or she is fearful of. There are three elements in the movie I find the thought of dreadful. Often when I am out in the cold, I wonder what would happen if I couldn't find a warm place. In certain situations, I think there is not enough air to breath. I don't have a fear of heights, but, oddly, I do have a great fear of falling. Vertical Limit takes place in zero degree weather on an icy, slippery mountain, so naturally I found it to be both frightening and fascinating. As thrillers went in the year 2000, this flick was at the top of the heap. Or the mountain.",4,Thrills and chills overcome absurd story.

Thinking about the time wasted watching it, I would just as soon like to forget about it and say - the less said about this movie the better. That however is not a fair review. Not fair only because it doesn't provide readers with any information.So gritting my teeth, I reflect back on Vertical Limit. Opening scene. A family of mountaineers are on a sheer rock face. The father Royce Garrett and his son Peter (Chris O'Donnell) and daughter Annie (Robin Tunney) are climbing as a team, when an accident leaves them in peril. All three are dangling by a single lifeline. As the clamp holding them all in place begins to slip, Peter is forced into making a terrible choice. Save himself and Annie by cutting loose the extra weight of his father or do nothing and all three die. Against the screams of his sister not to do it and at the urging of his father, who insists it is the only choice, Peter cuts dad loose. He plummets hundreds of feet and we witness him thudding into the ground below. Needless to say this destroys the close relationship between Annie and Peter.The movie is not about mountains, it's about relationships. So says the director - Martin Campbell and it very obvious what the story here is about - the reconciliation between Peter and Annie. In working out this reconciliation we are taken up the mountain with a cast of characters that are shallow and uninteristing. After a lot of climbing, falling, dangling and exploding we get the resolution.  Oh, along the way Peter gets to do it again. Cut loose another couple of people, sending them plunging down a crevasse.  What is the symbolism here? Is it that one of them is a father figure, and in the second cutting of the cord with this person, for the same reason as the first time, saving his and Annie's life, Peter and Annie can let go their guilt and achieve reconciliation? Who knows?, but It doesn't matter because by now you will be so numbed by the poor acting and the cliched and stereotypical characters that you won't care if the whole lot of them fall off the mountain.Use this line from the movie when you next want to question someone's intelligence.

This I got, but for an action movie there aren't nearly enough thrills.  It starts with Peter (O'Donnell) and Annie (Tunney) having to cut their father loose after a climbing accident.  Although Peter is too scarred by the incident to climb ever again, Annie goes on to become world-famous and her next challenge is K2.  After an incredibly slow build-up, they finally face the mountain with predictable results.  Yes, trying to get to the top despite that big storm brewing was not a good idea, and Annie and to other climbers get stuck in a chasm.  Peter and a team of rescuers go up after them.  Plot wise this is it, but the plot's not really the problem.The acting is all formulaic, but it's the blatant disregard for human life which is perhaps most baffling in a film with such a low rating as this.  Between the lot of them, they manage about five nitroglycerene explosions up in the mountains, so many in fact that this becomes a by-numbers movie more than anything else.  Plus, by the ending where Peter finally gets to rescue Annie it's difficult to feel sorry for two people that literally have a death count behind them.  Given this, in a way it's quite a perturbing movie, but it's still just basically big and dumb.There's plenty of stunning landscape, along with wide sweeps over the mountains in hope that the audience won't notice the movie itself.

Actually, it wasn't!!!Indeed, making a movie about natural phenomena requires excellent CGIs and camera work. These components are over-abundant in Vertical Limit. However, to make a good movie it also requires a plausible plot and credible actors' performance. In this movie the gape between these both is abyssal.Yes, O'Donell is a handsome guy, but even his luminous blue eyes and flashing 1000-buck smile can't overshadow lack of heart everyone has put into this movie (and O'Donell's is the most bearable performance). The girl cast for his sister is a laugh: the lack of any &quot;family&quot; ties and &quot;sisterly&quot; feelings is evident from the first scene, she simply can't act (The best she could get was coughing her throat off faking emphysema)! Not to mention that she does not look an inch an alpinist, but a kindergarten nurse. Other characters were not better: a couple of kick-off crazy brothers thrown in just to squeeze a weak smile at their crude jokes from yawning audience. A shapely medical nurse looking as if she just left a beauty parlor. A preposterous AA-looking outcast of an alpinist bearing his &quot;dark and sad&quot; (and, in the end, primitive) secret. And guess who was the best candidate for a villain? Of course, the one who has sky-fly ambitions. Actually he didn't seem despicable enough, that's why some cheap tricks were added to despoil his image for the audience.The plot is spring-snow thin, but you've probably read what the movie's about. But some moments are &quot;superb&quot;: 1)The Pakistani general brotherly sharing explosives with the alpinists - it is a sample of generosity. 2) Nitroglycerin that is supposed to blow up from the slightest tremble is safely carried by the alpinists on their backs. When they use it to free their friends, against any laws of physics, it doesn't blow their roofs off and doesn't cause another avalanche... These and other &quot;plot twists&quot; make you chuckle regularly.If you're in just for sights of beautiful nature - watch this movie. In other ways it remains a half-baked product for those who stubbornly refuses to believe in laws of logics and human physiology. 2 STARS!

What ensues is a 1 and a half hour yawn filled with impossible stunts, stereotypical characters we've seen a thousand times, laughable plot lines, and relatively poor CGI effects.This is one of those films that make me shake my head and wonder how reasonably intelligent people can like it. Aside from the opening scene, I cannot name one good thing about the movie. It is entirely unbelievable, and I'm not just talking about the stunts. The plots were terrible, illogical, and full of holes. (i.e... So they just discovered the nitroglycerine leaks from its tanks. Oh, and they just figured out that it explodes in sunlight. And they found out right as they're about to enter sunlight, even though they've been hiking for a day and a half already. But wait - the previous nitroglycerine explosions have killed anyone within 300 hundred yards and caused massive avalanches, but they're going to simply use it to save the trapped climbers. Terrible.)The above is only one example out of many.

We should all sue the makers for the 2 hours of my life they stole from us. Don't bother to see this movie unless you are engaged in some kind of 'worst movie-athon' kind of thing. The plot is  absurd, disjointed, implausible, overtly manipulative, and formulaic. The acting is just lame. The writing and dialogue are insultingly bad. What else shall we cover? Everywhere you look in this movie, you'll be disappointed.And for the Amazon.com movie critic's review to say that there is now finally a movie for the REI crowd - that is another outrage. To imply that climbers will enjoy this tripe is bizarre and totally wrong. This is just the latest cynical offering in a long line of stinkers from Hollywood in its attempt to cash in on the current mass-interest in outdoor sports. Climbers will be the most disappointed of all with this movie.As an active climber myself, I have made a point of seeking out all the movies that involve climbing... From Stallone's 'Cliffhanger' to omnimax 'Everest' to the ridiculous 'K2,' Hollywood is simply incapable of turning out a decent movie that mixes in climbing. At least 'Cliffhanger was a semi-engaging action film if you ignored the utterly implausible climbing sequences. 'Vertical Limit' doesn't even do that. It fails on every front.The only 'climbing films' that I could recommend would be Clint Eastwood's 'Eiger Sanction' and that old Disney thing that I can't ever remember the name of (it was based on a James Ramsey Ullman book - it's kind of a kid's movie, but at least it's well made). You'll have to get way off the beaten path to find really good climbing movies (Banff Mountain Film Festival is a good place to start - check out G&ouml;ran Kropp's movie about cycling from Norway to Everest, climbing it without oxygen, and cycling back).Sorry to stray from the movie review.

Glenn is an excellent actor and does a great job in his part, he's easily the coolest character in the movie.The simple story, Peter's sister Annie is lost on K2 in bad weather. They've got 22 hours to get to them or they die. Garrett gathers a bunch of people and they go up. Mostly they are the craziest or most desperate of the climbers at base camp.Neatest stuff in the movie: You get great views of beautiful scenery, you get to see a bit into the life-style of professional climbers, and you learn a little about where K2 is and that there is a war going on between Pakistan and India, a little of which happens near K2. Oh Dr. Bashir from Star Trek: DS 9 is in the movie playing a Pakistan climber who does a good job with his accent and the acting.Stupidest stuff in the movie: the nitro - sure we have this super explosive, super sensitive nitro laying around that explodes when it gets exposed to sunlight and it's right next to our 9 inch howitzers that we shoot at India every day.

Her brother, who has sworn off climbing because of his father's climbing death, has no choice but to assemble a team to rescue the trio.WHAT WORKS: As already mentioned, the opening sequence is excellent, the locations (New Zealand Alps) are great, the story pretty much keeps your attention (until the absurdities really mount up -- pun intended) and both Robin Tunney & Izabella Scorupco are deliciously beautiful.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: As the story continues the believability decreases severely. In fact, the crisis/suspense/action sequences are so EXTREME and strung so close together (especially as the movie proceeds) that they tend to make you bust out laughing -- the very OPPOSITE reaction the creators wanted. By the very end the ridiculous overkill made me lose interest in whatever story was supposed to be there.FINAL ANALYSIS: I was hoping for something unexpectedly great like ""The Edge,"" but ended up with a fun but ultimately shallow time-waster. For comparison, ""Cliffhanger"" is ""Apocalypse Now"" next to ""Vertical Limit.""",3,A Fun Time but OVERKILL to the Extreme,1111017600,"03 17, 2005",2005,1300,"['had', 'high', 'hopes', 'film', 'seeing', 'thrilling', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'Utah', 'alas', 'was', 'not', 'be.THE', 'STORY', 'famous', 'female', 'climber', 'stuck', 'ice', 'cave', 'two', 'others', 'top', 'K2', 'second', 'highest', 'mountain', 'Earth', 'brother', 'who', 'sworn', 'off', 'climbing', 'father', 'climbing', 'death', 'choice', 'assemble', 'team', 'rescue', 'trio.WHAT', 'already', 'mentioned', 'opening', 'sequence', 'excellent', 'locations', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Alps', 'are', 'great', 'story', 'pretty', 'much', 'keeps', 'attention', 'absurdities', 'really', 'mount', 'up', 'pun', 'intended', 'Robin', 'Tunney', 'Izabella', 'Scorupco', 'are', 'deliciously', 'beautiful.WHAT', 'DOES', ""N'T"", 'WORK', 'story', 'believability', 'severely', 'fact', 'crisis/suspense/action', 'sequences', 'are', 'so', 'EXTREME', 'strung', 'so', 'close', 'together', 'especially', 'movie', 'proceeds', 'tend', 'make', 'bust', 'out', 'laughing', 'very', 'OPPOSITE', 'reaction', 'creators', 'wanted', 'very', 'end', 'ridiculous', 'overkill', 'made', 'lose', 'interest', 'story', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'there.FINAL', 'ANALYSIS', 'was', 'hoping', 'something', 'unexpectedly', 'great', 'Edge', 'ended', 'up', 'fun', 'ultimately', 'shallow', 'time-waster', 'comparison', 'Cliffhanger', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'next', 'Vertical', 'Limit']",N/A

A great movie at a truly great price and a movie that I will enjoy watching repeatedly for many years to come.,5,Verical Limit,1381795200,"10 15, 2013",2013,247,"['saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'loved', 'Very', 'edgy', '.very', 'suspenseful', '.a', 'real', 'white', 'knuckle', 'experience', 'great', 'movie', 'truly', 'great', 'price', 'movie', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'repeatedly', 'many', 'years', 'come']",N/A
