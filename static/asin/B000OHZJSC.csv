1064114,AL1PNYDIILV4D,B000OHZJSC,Bill Michaels,"[2, 3]","This is a very compelling documentary. There will be incredible resistance from the Christian faithful to this film because if the tomb found in 1980 was indeed the tomb of Jesus and his family, the resurrection which is the very foundation of Christianity is called into question. The film is well made, well researched and intriguing. Those trashing the film are sticking their heads in the sand. They just flat out don't want to know or hear anything other then the Christian dogma. In the film, the Israeli Antiquities agency blatantly suppressed the finding of this tomb. Why? Because if it were declared authentic and the findings revealed, Christianity would need to rewrite the tenets of their faith and set it back on its heels. I found this to be an eye opening film.

However, those who can accept the Resurrection as having spiritual meaning instead or who can approach the subject in a nonreligious context will find this documentary an enthralling presentation about an archaeological discovery made near Jerusalem in 1980: the tomb and physical remains of Jesus of Nazareth and his family, or at the very least that is what the film-makers believe (and they make a persuasive case for their views).  This DVD is the ""director's cut"" version of a documentary originally shown in the US on The Discovery Channel; additional interviews concerning several topics have been added.This is not some wooly New Age or supernatural-leaning show, heavy on ill-supported speculation and short on hard evidence, but rather a careful documentary laying out the case that the tomb of Jesus (and family) has indeed been found.  I think this to be one of the most fascinating historical television documentaries I have ever seen.Anyone favorably impressed by this documentary would do well to read ""The Jesus Family tomb"" by Simcha Jacobovici and Charles Pelligrino for additional details and evidence.",5,Persuasive documentary about a controversial discovery,1177459200,"04 25, 2007",2007,1311,"['Devout', 'Christians', 'who', 'consider', 'physical', 'bodily', 'resurrection', 'Jesus', 'be', 'necessary', 'integral', 'part', 'beliefs', 'would', 'probably', 'do', 'well', 'not', 'watch', 'Lost', 'Tomb', 'Jesus', 'However', 'who', 'can', 'accept', 'Resurrection', 'having', 'spiritual', 'meaning', 'instead', 'who', 'can', 'approach', 'subject', 'nonreligious', 'context', 'will', 'find', 'documentary', 'enthralling', 'presentation', 'archaeological', 'discovery', 'made', 'Jerusalem', '1980', 'tomb', 'physical', 'remains', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', 'family', 'very', 'least', 'what', 'film-makers', 'believe', 'make', 'persuasive', 'case', 'views', 'DVD', 'director', 'cut', 'version', 'documentary', 'originally', 'shown', 'US', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'additional', 'interviews', 'concerning', 'several', 'topics', 'have', 'been', 'added.This', 'not', 'wooly', 'New', 'Age', 'supernatural-leaning', 'show', 'heavy', 'ill-supported', 'speculation', 'short', 'hard', 'evidence', 'rather', 'careful', 'documentary', 'laying', 'out', 'case', 'tomb', 'Jesus', 'family', 'indeed', 'been', 'found', 'think', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'historical', 'television', 'documentaries', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.Anyone', 'favorably', 'impressed', 'documentary', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'read', 'Jesus', 'Family', 'tomb', 'Simcha', 'Jacobovici', 'Charles', 'Pelligrino', 'additional', 'details', 'evidence']",The Lost Tomb of Jesus
1064116,A3I8OURC83NM6V,B000OHZJSC,"Christopher M. Fulton ""Purveyor of Truth""","[21, 24]","Let me start this review with a recap of what we know from the DVD.  We found the tomb of a person named Jesus who had a father named Joseph.  We have a Maria, a Miriamne, a Jose and a Matthew.  So, having stated that, have we found the tomb of the Historical Jesus?  We feel we know what happened to the Biblical Jesus based on the Gospels.  Based on this, is it possible to find a Jesus tomb?  Granted, it does not say ""Jesus, son of Joesph, from Nazereth"" on the ossuary.  As one of the experts comments in the show (paraphrased) ""...If we find the bones of Jesus of Nazereth, does that destroy faith in Christianity?  It does not destroy MY faith.  I leave what happens to bodies after they die to God.""  That is also my take on this.  If we can prove that this is the Historical Jesus' body, it does not ruin my faith.  It just offers a little more faith that this person who has numerous texts actually set foot on earth and said all these wonderful things.  As far as those who may say, ""well if there is a body then he could not have resurrected"", why not?  We all go under the assumption he physically rose from the dead and went human body and all to heaven.  He could have done that, why not?  He's the Son of God after all.  It could also have been a strictly spiritual resurrection.  Again, he's the Son of God, if his spirit body went to heaven and He wanted to show himself to his disciples to prove he ""resurrected"", he could do that as well and even let the disciples touch him.Of course it is also possible that Jesus lived and died, said and did most of these wonderful things the Gospels attribute to him, then when they committed story to paper, they embellished it to make him a God-like being.In the end, I don't know whether this is the tomb of the Historical Jesus or not.  And this is not totally set out to prove one way or the other.  What Simcha is trying to do, from my opinion, is set the evidence in front of the viewer and let the viewer decide if we found the tomb of Jesus of Nazereth or if we just found the biggest coincidence in recorded history. Either way, it is a great show.",5,Interesting,1189296000,"09 9, 2007",2007,2116,"['Let', 'start', 'review', 'recap', 'what', 'know', 'DVD', 'found', 'tomb', 'person', 'named', 'Jesus', 'who', 'had', 'father', 'named', 'Joseph', 'have', 'Maria', 'Miriamne', 'Jose', 'Matthew', 'So', 'having', 'stated', 'have', 'found', 'tomb', 'Historical', 'Jesus', 'feel', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'Biblical', 'Jesus', 'based', 'Gospels', 'Based', 'possible', 'find', 'Jesus', 'tomb', 'Granted', 'not', 'say', 'Jesus', 'son', 'Joesph', 'Nazereth', 'ossuary', 'one', 'experts', 'comments', 'show', 'paraphrased', 'find', 'bones', 'Jesus', 'Nazereth', 'destroy', 'faith', 'Christianity', 'not', 'destroy', 'MY', 'faith', 'leave', 'what', 'bodies', 'die', 'God', 'also', 'take', 'can', 'prove', 'Historical', 'Jesus', 'body', 'not', 'ruin', 'faith', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'faith', 'person', 'who', 'numerous', 'texts', 'actually', 'set', 'foot', 'earth', 'said', 'wonderful', 'things', 'As', 'far', 'who', 'may', 'say', 'well', 'body', 'then', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'resurrected', 'why', 'not', 'go', 'assumption', 'physically', 'rose', 'dead', 'went', 'human', 'body', 'heaven', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'why', 'not', 'Son', 'God', 'could', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'strictly', 'spiritual', 'resurrection', 'Again', 'Son', 'God', 'spirit', 'body', 'went', 'heaven', 'wanted', 'show', 'disciples', 'prove', 'resurrected', 'could', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'let', 'disciples', 'touch', 'him.Of', 'course', 'also', 'possible', 'Jesus', 'lived', 'died', 'said', 'did', 'most', 'wonderful', 'things', 'Gospels', 'attribute', 'then', 'when', 'committed', 'story', 'paper', 'embellished', 'make', 'God-like', 'being.In', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'tomb', 'Historical', 'Jesus', 'not', 'not', 'totally', 'set', 'out', 'prove', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'What', 'Simcha', 'trying', 'do', 'opinion', 'set', 'evidence', 'front', 'viewer', 'let', 'viewer', 'decide', 'found', 'tomb', 'Jesus', 'Nazereth', 'just', 'found', 'biggest', 'coincidence', 'recorded', 'history', 'way', 'great', 'show']",The Lost Tomb of Jesus

Not only does it perform as a content-laden doc, but from a production stand-point, in my opinion, it is a spectacular watch from start to finish, for it feels like a feature film during the viewing, a mystery of the highest caliber as the story develops and unfolds. I sat riveted during the entire experience.At the root of the story-line is the 1980 uncovering of an underground tomb, found during a construction project in Jerusalem following the bulldozing of an area by developers planning the building of an apartment complex. Two children entered through an entrance-way emblazoned with a ancient chevron and found the extensive, built-out site that contained 10 limestone ossuaries (coffins). Of the ten, 6 had hand-written inscriptions.The discovery of the tomb in and of itself was not that uncommon. Others had been discovered, so the Israeli authorities were contacted as would be expected. The contents of the tomb were cataloged and brought to a storage facility.What took place 25 years later lays the groundwork for the film, for upon further inspection of the inscriptions, it came to light that the 6 readable names all related to members of Jesus' family, something that originally was not put together.As the Director lets the story unfold, the claims themselves are presented as a mystery. Recreations are mixed with expert interviews and scientific corroboration i.e. DNA testing of scrapings from the ossuaries. The filmmaking itself makes use of current technology on numerous fronts including the use of robotic cameras to first enter the tombs (which had been resealed after the contents had been removed).Adding to all of this is Director Simcha Jocabovici's persona, one that can be compared to an archaeologist on a phenomenal hunt and journey. His personal excitement really adds an incredible dimension to the production. I am not convinced that another Director could have pulled this off with such verve.Forgetting for a moment the religious ramifications that this film poses, the viewing experience alone is of incredible value on a human-interest level. Adding in the film's claims that have not only a religious bend to them, but also a major historical discovery angle for all people, the film becomes one that certainly leads to, if nothing else, a debate of the highest order.  Jocabovici, an expert filmmaker for sure, has produced a program that is riveting to watch, enlightening to experience and historical to digest.I recommend this film for all to see.",5,"Riveting, enlightening and well worth the view...",1175212800,"03 30, 2007",2007,2804,"['consider', 'fortunate', 'have', 'had', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'advance', 'copy', 'film', 'finding', 'be', 'nothing', 'short', 'fantastic', 'had', 'post', 'review', 'Directors', 'Cut', 'version', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'Special', 'one', 'finest', 'documentaries', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'chance', 'watch', 'Not', 'only', 'perform', 'content-laden', 'doc', 'production', 'stand-point', 'opinion', 'spectacular', 'watch', 'start', 'finish', 'feature', 'film', 'viewing', 'mystery', 'highest', 'caliber', 'story', 'unfolds', 'sat', 'riveted', 'entire', 'experience.At', 'root', 'story-line', '1980', 'uncovering', 'underground', 'tomb', 'found', 'construction', 'project', 'Jerusalem', 'following', 'bulldozing', 'area', 'developers', 'planning', 'building', 'apartment', 'complex', 'Two', 'children', 'entered', 'entrance-way', 'emblazoned', 'ancient', 'chevron', 'found', 'extensive', 'built-out', 'site', 'contained', '10', 'limestone', 'ossuaries', 'coffins', 'ten', '6', 'had', 'hand-written', 'inscriptions.The', 'discovery', 'tomb', 'was', 'not', 'uncommon', 'Others', 'had', 'been', 'discovered', 'Israeli', 'authorities', 'were', 'contacted', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'contents', 'tomb', 'were', 'cataloged', 'brought', 'storage', 'took', 'place', '25', 'years', 'later', 'groundwork', 'film', 'further', 'inspection', 'inscriptions', 'came', 'light', '6', 'readable', 'names', 'related', 'members', 'Jesus', 'family', 'something', 'originally', 'was', 'not', 'put', 'together.As', 'Director', 'story', 'unfold', 'claims', 'are', 'presented', 'mystery', 'Recreations', 'are', 'mixed', 'expert', 'interviews', 'scientific', 'corroboration', 'i.e', 'DNA', 'testing', 'scrapings', 'ossuaries', 'filmmaking', 'use', 'current', 'technology', 'numerous', 'fronts', 'including', 'use', 'robotic', 'cameras', 'first', 'enter', 'tombs', 'had', 'been', 'resealed', 'contents', 'had', 'been', 'removed', '.Adding', 'Director', 'Simcha', 'Jocabovici', 'persona', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'archaeologist', 'phenomenal', 'hunt', 'journey', 'personal', 'excitement', 'really', 'incredible', 'dimension', 'production', 'am', 'not', 'convinced', 'Director', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'such', 'verve.Forgetting', 'moment', 'religious', 'ramifications', 'film', 'viewing', 'experience', 'alone', 'incredible', 'value', 'human-interest', 'level', 'Adding', 'film', 'claims', 'have', 'not', 'only', 'religious', 'bend', 'also', 'major', 'historical', 'discovery', 'angle', 'people', 'film', 'one', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'else', 'debate', 'highest', 'order', 'Jocabovici', 'expert', 'filmmaker', 'sure', 'produced', 'program', 'riveting', 'watch', 'enlightening', 'experience', 'historical', 'digest.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'see']",The Lost Tomb of Jesus

It follows a group of archeologists on their search for proof that a tomb that was uncovered actually holds the remains of Jesus, as well as his family (including Mary Magdalene).Throughout the DVD, they employ the assistance of various modern tools of science including forensics and, interestingly enough, the tools of the trade of a plumber! Their discoveries are not absolute proof, but will get you thinking.The documentary focused mainly on the the proof that they had and kind of skewed the viewpoint toward the tomb actually belonging to the family of Jesus.

Experts, scholars and propagandists put together documentaries as if they have some idea about what happened.  As with many other documentaries concerning the origins of Christianity, those who make them are story tellers, many of whom profess that no personal beliefs were expressed in the telling of their story.  If this is true, why put the energy into the creation of a documentary at all?  To label parts of these documentaries as ""recreations"" is absurd.  What are they recreating?  Is it some version of the myth with which the director's or producer's disagreed and had a better idea of what happened 2,000 years ago?  If Jesus existed, it was too long ago for anyone to think they got the story ""right"".  There is nothing remaining that provides us with ""the"" truth.We all have played the game at one time or another where a very short story or scenario is whispered to the person next to us going around a table and by the time it gets back to us it has changed, sometimes significantly.  Imagine this process going on for at least 100 generations and the person who started the story is long gone.  Where can we make a credible start?  Those who want or need to believe will try to fit these documentaries in with their personal beliefs, and it they do not fit, they will be rejected.  I do not think or believe they really add anything to our knowledge.

1064120,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B000OHZJSC,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[9, 10]","THE LOST TOMB OF JESUS (for the Discovery Channel, prod. James Cameron, dir./hosted Simcha Jacobovici, April 2007) already has a Christian 'debunking response team' on this issue (with the pathetic documentaryThe Jesus Tomb Unmasked). Wait until they see the 2012 documentary and the book (The Jesus Discovery: The Resurrection Tomb that Reveals the Birth of Christianity) that is the follow-up on this!In a funny and otherwise nondescript neighborhood in Talpiot - a ""borough"" of Jerusalem close to Bethlehem - was discovered a cave. It turns out this was not a cave, but a rather beautiful family mausoleum, or a tomb if you like. It contained neatly arranged ossuaries and obviously belonged to a family. An ossuary is a box in which bones of long-dead relatives are placed in order that they may be reburied in a tomb like this. Saves time and space in the long run, in ancient Jewish tradition. They do something like this in certain Asian countries.You probably know of the ossuary that was sold out onto the market and everyone went nuts because it was allegedly the ossuary of one James - you know, James the Just, a/k/a James the brother of Jesus. Well this family tomb contained ossuaries exactly like his. In fact, the scientists found evidence that a box was totally missing from here: probably the James' ossuary, and measurements made by Professor James Tabor bear that out.Whose ""bone boxes"" did they find here? Look at this: Jesus son of Joseph. Mary Magdalen bearing a title along with her name, ""Mara"", like a female rabbi. A son, a teen boy named Judah-son-of-Jesus, in his ossuary next to his parents. In another ""room"", that is to say, a separate vault, they found another family. This time the husband, Joseph (Yehosep). His wife, Maria (spelt in Hebrew, the exact name, ""Maria""). Finally they identified one Matia, which is Greek for Matthew. No one is sure about him, but it is an Asmonean [Hasmonean] name.What do you suppose happened to the brains of the scientists who first examined these findings in 1980? It's only a very slim chance [1 in 200, I have heard] that this family vault did not belong to someone other than the famous, the one-and-only, Jesus and Company.This documentary covers Jacobovici's epic quest to find the tomb. It is fantastic and detailed - I am a huge fan of Simcha Jacobovici and his documentary work (see my reviewQuest For The Lost Tribes, one of Simcha's best, and see my review ofSecrets of Christianityin which Simcha addresses 'the rest of the story'). Here Simcha makes no bones about who he thinks is entombed in this place.Well I say get this. Simcha's works are among my most prized DVDs. You may not know this, but the Jewish government moved fast to seal up, and concrete over, this discovery. Yet Jacobovici, on the trip of a lifetime, managed to get into the place, film, take samples. He managed to get James Cameron onboard as well. The folks entombed in that place are THE Family, the proof is there and it is powerful. It shatters the pagan-inspired myth of Christianity.Jacobovici and company make a good argument in accordance with the findings that it is ""Jesus Christ"" and his family entombed in this tomb. The Jewish government panicking and sealing up the place - that's another story and I do not know much of the workings of that. I can only encourage you to get this documentary, study it, listen, look, watch.Then decide for yourself if a Jewish rabbi tried to start a religion, or tried passing himself off as contender for Mesiah, was crucified by the Romans and then came back to life - or was he a prominent rabbi who got married, had some squirrely kids, died like everyone else and had his bones land in an ossuary (which means he likely had descendants to do that for him). The latter fact places his death within a precise century because the Jews only got to practice this kind of burial for about a century.This is true and beautiful scientific discovery at its best. That is why no one really believes it. The only complaint I have is Jacobovici's desperation to tie these findings with ""the first Christians"". These people were JEWS, Simcha, not ""Christians"". A 'Christian' is a pagan who came along 100 years later with corroded, perverted ideas. However, is Simcha pushing that? Or is he saying ""christianos"" originally meant something else? Simcha implies that Jesus was a vital part of a political movement and its adherents named themselves ""christianos"" which is the neo-Greek term for ""Messianists"".I want you to read an official report, The Discovery Channel News, dateline  25 February, 2007: ""New scientific evidence, including DNA analysis conducted at one of the world's foremost molecular genetics laboratories, as well as studies by leading scholars, suggests a 2,000-year-old Jerusalem tomb could have once held the remains of Jesus of Nazareth and his family. The findings also suggest that Jesus and Mary Magdalene might have produced a son named Judah.""The DNA findings, alongside statistical conclusions made about the artifacts -- originally excavated in 1980 -- open a potentially significant chapter in Biblical archaeological history. A documentary presenting the evidence, 'The Lost Tomb of Jesus', will premiere on the Discovery Channel on March 4 [2007] at 9 p.m. [Eastern time]. The documentary comes from executive producer James Cameron and director Simcha Jacobovici.""What do you think of all that?Get this documentary and LEARN. If you want the deep and fascinating backstory, get Jacobovici's 2007 bookThe Jesus Family Tomb: The Discovery That Will Change History Forever. Simcha Jacobovici & Charles Pellegrinoor the other edition,The Jesus Family Tomb: The Evidence Behind the Discovery No One Wanted to Find(and bear in mind there is a 2008 edition I'm not sure I even listed because Amazon might not have it). Read those cover-to-cover. See my reviews.You will be inspired to learn for yourself, to study, and if you are a believer, you'll see it as God's gift. If you believe not, you'll STILL see it as God's gift!

The production values were good, much of it was filmed in the Middle East, many of the actors were apparently Middle Eastern, the ancient scenes weren't filmed in English, and the story reads like a detective piece.Now, for the negative part.  This documentary apparenty shook people's faiths for no good reason.  Yes I have watched the documentary.  I also looked at some evidence listed in favor of it printed from the web (including either or both the Discovery Channel's website and the documentarie's).  I have also seen people writing in defense of it.  However, I also looked at numerous views from the opposing side and found out why so many biblical scholars trashed the film's claims.  The term half-truth doesn't do justice to the level of overblown speculation seen in the film.  Frankly, I have better things to do than write a book of my own on its failures.

1064126,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B000OHZJSC,Newton Ooi,"[9, 12]","By the title of this film, one expects controversy, so I should start of by saying that I am not devoutly religious in any way shape or form.  I never went to Sunday school, am not an expert in the Bible or in the history of the world around the time of Christ.  I watched this DVD purely out of interest, and I came away very impressed with it.This movie examines the contents of a tomb accidentally discovered in Jerusalem in 1980 by construction workers.  Inside the tomb were 10 ossuaries, and six of them were inscribed with names, supposedly, from Jesus Christ's family.  They include Maria (Virgin Mary), Jesus son of Joseph (Jesus Christ), Mariamne (Mary Magdelene), Matthew (brother of Jesus), Jose (another brother of Jesus), and Judah (son of Jesus).  Yes, that's right, this movie hints that Jesus and Mary Magdelene had a son named Judah.  The movie takes pains to show how these names were read, and interpreted to correlate with names from the Bible.  The movie also shows how the relationship between some of the names changes depending on which part of the Bible one is reading.  Most importantly, the movie provides arguments as to why its conclusions are not supported by mainstream Western theology; i.e. why Mary Magdelene could have been Jesus's wife, yet she is never mentioned as such in the Bible.External sources are cited, such as ancient literary works.  The movie is told like a detective story, with the filmaker leading the way as principle investigator.  Many of the clues are found real time with the camera taping it the entire time.  The movie follows scientists as they examine evidence such as sediments on the ossuaries, ancient texts, maps and drawings, etc...  The movie even has a professional statistician go through the odds of another family at that time having the same set of names and being buried together.  The point of the movie is that we, humans, have found the tomb of Jesus Christ and his family members, and that he had fathered a son with Mary Magdalene.The movie and the special features include interviews with many Biblical experts, archaelogists, forensic experts, historians, linguists, and even religious officials from multiple countries and institutions.  All are given lots of time to voice their doubts, opinions, and biases as to the evidence and the conclusions.There are several questions that the movie does not address, and should have in order to improve its believability.  First, what about the other ossuaries?  Ten were found in the tomb, but only six are examined as part of this movie.  Second, this viewer assumes that bones were found in all 10 ossuaries.  Why was DNA evidence not extracted from all 10?  Third, the movie producers should have tried and dated the age of death for all 10 skeletons, and see if these ages corresponded to what is in the Bible.  Fourth and last, the movie, or one of the extra features, should have spent some time showing how the tomb was dated to about 0 (Zero) AD.  But even with these drawbacks, this was a great movie.  I consider it as one of the best documentaries to have been released this decade.  The narration is great, the interviews seem frank, engaging and unscripted, the facts presented are convincing, and the pacing of the movie was perfect.  Facts were presented like a well-crafted lawyer's argument.  Overall, I highly recommend this movie.",5,Great documentary,1181520000,"06 11, 2007",2007,3374,"['title', 'film', 'one', 'controversy', 'should', 'start', 'saying', 'am', 'not', 'devoutly', 'religious', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'never', 'went', 'Sunday', 'school', 'am', 'not', 'expert', 'Bible', 'history', 'world', 'time', 'Christ', 'watched', 'DVD', 'purely', 'interest', 'came', 'away', 'very', 'impressed', 'it.This', 'movie', 'contents', 'tomb', 'accidentally', 'discovered', 'Jerusalem', '1980', 'construction', 'workers', 'tomb', 'were', '10', 'ossuaries', 'six', 'were', 'inscribed', 'names', 'supposedly', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'family', 'include', 'Maria', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'Jesus', 'son', 'Joseph', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Mariamne', 'Mary', 'Magdelene', 'Matthew', 'brother', 'Jesus', 'Jose', 'brother', 'Jesus', 'Judah', 'son', 'Jesus', 'Yes', 'right', 'movie', 'Jesus', 'Mary', 'Magdelene', 'had', 'son', 'named', 'Judah', 'movie', 'pains', 'show', 'how', 'names', 'were', 'read', 'interpreted', 'correlate', 'names', 'Bible', 'movie', 'also', 'how', 'relationship', 'names', 'changes', 'depending', 'part', 'Bible', 'one', 'reading', 'Most', 'importantly', 'movie', 'arguments', 'why', 'conclusions', 'are', 'not', 'supported', 'mainstream', 'Western', 'theology', 'i.e', 'why', 'Mary', 'Magdelene', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Jesus', 'wife', 'never', 'mentioned', 'such', 'Bible.External', 'sources', 'are', 'cited', 'such', 'ancient', 'literary', 'works', 'movie', 'told', 'detective', 'story', 'filmaker', 'leading', 'way', 'principle', 'investigator', 'Many', 'clues', 'are', 'found', 'real', 'time', 'camera', 'taping', 'entire', 'time', 'movie', 'scientists', 'examine', 'evidence', 'such', 'sediments', 'ossuaries', 'ancient', 'texts', 'maps', 'drawings', 'etc', 'movie', 'even', 'professional', 'statistician', 'go', 'odds', 'family', 'time', 'having', 'same', 'set', 'names', 'being', 'buried', 'together', 'point', 'movie', 'humans', 'have', 'found', 'tomb', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'family', 'members', 'had', 'fathered', 'son', 'Mary', 'Magdalene.The', 'movie', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'interviews', 'many', 'Biblical', 'experts', 'archaelogists', 'forensic', 'experts', 'historians', 'linguists', 'even', 'religious', 'officials', 'multiple', 'countries', 'institutions', 'are', 'given', 'lots', 'time', 'voice', 'doubts', 'opinions', 'evidence', 'conclusions.There', 'are', 'several', 'questions', 'movie', 'not', 'address', 'should', 'have', 'order', 'improve', 'believability', 'First', 'what', 'other', 'ossuaries', 'Ten', 'were', 'found', 'tomb', 'only', 'six', 'are', 'examined', 'part', 'movie', 'Second', 'viewer', 'bones', 'were', 'found', '10', 'ossuaries', 'Why', 'was', 'DNA', 'evidence', 'not', 'extracted', '10', 'Third', 'movie', 'producers', 'should', 'have', 'tried', 'dated', 'age', 'death', '10', 'skeletons', 'see', 'ages', 'corresponded', 'what', 'Bible', 'Fourth', 'last', 'movie', 'one', 'extra', 'features', 'should', 'have', 'spent', 'time', 'showing', 'how', 'tomb', 'was', 'dated', '0', 'Zero', 'AD', 'even', 'drawbacks', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'consider', 'one', 'best', 'documentaries', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'decade', 'narration', 'great', 'interviews', 'seem', 'frank', 'engaging', 'unscripted', 'facts', 'presented', 'are', 'convincing', 'pacing', 'movie', 'was', 'perfect', 'Facts', 'were', 'presented', 'well-crafted', 'lawyer', 'argument', 'Overall', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie']",The Lost Tomb of Jesus

Williams,"[0, 1]","I had already read ""The Jesus Family Tomb"",by Simcha Jacobovici and Charles Pellegrino, ""The Jesus Discovery"" by James Tabor and Simcha Jacobovici, and ""The Jesus Dynasty"" by James Tabor before watching this film.  So I was well prepared for the blockbuster film.  The books had laid a firm foundation for what was only aluded to in the presentation of the film and made it seem far more credible in my eyes.In 1980, in Talpiot, Israel, a construction crew, while preparing the foundations for new apartments, accidently opened a first century jewish tomb.  Israli archaeologists were immediately called in to investigate, as is the custom.  The musty ancient tomb contained 10 stone ossuaries, or bone boxes.  Six of them held hastily drawn inscriptions and were filled with the bones of the deceased.The ossuaries were properly cataloged, measured, photographed and were then carted away and placed in storage at the Rockefeller Museum in Beth Shemesh.  25 Years later, Simcha became curious about the grouping of Biblical names scribed on the outer surfaces of the ossuaries.  The names scribed were; Jesus, son of Joseph, Maria or Mary, Mariamne or Mary Magdalene, Matia or Matthew, and Judah son of Jesus.The IAA or Israel Antiquities Authority had claimed they had taken no particular interest in the ossuaries because they were common names and the rush of new construction in the area had produced a plethoria of ancient artifacts from sealed tombs.Simcha's team of experts carefully examined the site and entered the now empty tomb.  They examined the ossuaries and determined the probability that the boxes belong might actually belong to the family of Jesus.  The IAA had only recovered 9 of the original 10 boxes, however, a 10th ossuary was discovered that had been purchased on the black market some years before.  The inscription read; James, brother of Jesus.  At first, it was thought to be a fake inscription, however, careful and meticulus scientific examination revealed that the ""patinas"" matched with the other ossuaries found in the Talpiot tomb, like a fingerprint, indicating it had absolutely come from there.Combining all the available information and using statistics for the liklihood of that combination of names being present, the probability then became only 1 in 30,000 that this was NOT the family tomb of Jesus.Inflexible divinity students will not find this film convincing or appealing, but the science speaks for itself.  It is, however, interesting to note that in the first century, the original followers of Christianity did not feel that Christ was divine nor that he was the son of God who actually rose bodily to Heaven.  He was simply a healer and a teacher with a new message.",5,"WHATEVER WE MIGHT BELIEVE,THE SCIENCE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF",1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,2722,"['had', 'already', 'read', 'Jesus', 'Family', 'Tomb', 'Simcha', 'Jacobovici', 'Charles', 'Pellegrino', 'Jesus', 'Discovery', 'James', 'Tabor', 'Simcha', 'Jacobovici', 'Jesus', 'Dynasty', 'James', 'Tabor', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'prepared', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'books', 'had', 'laid', 'firm', 'foundation', 'what', 'was', 'only', 'aluded', 'presentation', 'film', 'made', 'seem', 'far', 'more', 'credible', 'eyes.In', '1980', 'Talpiot', 'Israel', 'construction', 'crew', 'preparing', 'foundations', 'new', 'apartments', 'accidently', 'opened', 'first', 'century', 'jewish', 'tomb', 'Israli', 'archaeologists', 'were', 'immediately', 'called', 'investigate', 'custom', 'musty', 'ancient', 'tomb', 'contained', '10', 'stone', 'ossuaries', 'bone', 'boxes', 'Six', 'held', 'hastily', 'drawn', 'inscriptions', 'were', 'filled', 'bones', 'deceased.The', 'ossuaries', 'were', 'properly', 'cataloged', 'measured', 'photographed', 'were', 'then', 'carted', 'away', 'placed', 'storage', 'Rockefeller', 'Museum', 'Beth', 'Shemesh', '25', 'Years', 'later', 'Simcha', 'became', 'curious', 'grouping', 'Biblical', 'names', 'scribed', 'outer', 'surfaces', 'ossuaries', 'names', 'scribed', 'were', 'Jesus', 'son', 'Joseph', 'Maria', 'Mary', 'Mariamne', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'Matia', 'Matthew', 'Judah', 'son', 'Jesus.The', 'IAA', 'Israel', 'Antiquities', 'Authority', 'had', 'claimed', 'had', 'taken', 'no', 'particular', 'interest', 'ossuaries', 'were', 'common', 'names', 'rush', 'new', 'construction', 'area', 'had', 'produced', 'plethoria', 'ancient', 'artifacts', 'sealed', 'tombs.Simcha', 'team', 'experts', 'carefully', 'examined', 'site', 'entered', 'now', 'empty', 'tomb', 'examined', 'ossuaries', 'determined', 'probability', 'boxes', 'belong', 'might', 'actually', 'belong', 'family', 'Jesus', 'IAA', 'had', 'only', 'recovered', '9', 'original', '10', 'boxes', 'however', '10th', 'ossuary', 'was', 'discovered', 'had', 'been', 'purchased', 'black', 'market', 'years', 'inscription', 'read', 'James', 'brother', 'Jesus', 'first', 'was', 'thought', 'be', 'fake', 'inscription', 'however', 'careful', 'meticulus', 'scientific', 'examination', 'revealed', 'patinas', 'matched', 'other', 'ossuaries', 'found', 'Talpiot', 'tomb', 'fingerprint', 'indicating', 'had', 'absolutely', 'come', 'there.Combining', 'available', 'information', 'using', 'statistics', 'liklihood', 'combination', 'names', 'being', 'present', 'probability', 'then', 'became', 'only', '1', '30,000', 'was', 'NOT', 'family', 'tomb', 'Jesus.Inflexible', 'divinity', 'students', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'film', 'convincing', 'appealing', 'science', 'speaks', 'however', 'interesting', 'note', 'first', 'century', 'original', 'followers', 'Christianity', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'Christ', 'was', 'divine', 'was', 'son', 'God', 'who', 'actually', 'rose', 'bodily', 'Heaven', 'was', 'simply', 'healer', 'teacher', 'new', 'message']",The Lost Tomb of Jesus
1064129,A98F5MVSKWC15,B000OHZJSC,Santi Tafarella,"[6, 8]","I took it for granted that there was something fundamentally flawed and overblown to the story of ""The Lost Tomb of Jesus."" But, actually, this film is a compelling piece of detective work. The filmmakers consult experts and piece together an intriguing thesis. And their admirable tracking down of the original tomb (buried under an apartment complex), makes for compelling filming. The film's thesis is very far from ""airtight,"" but it is, nevertheless, quite interesting.Usually, if a scientific thesis bypasses the scientific community, and scientific journals, and is laid out before the general public in the form of a popular film or book, you can bet that it probably has very little real evidence to support it. But in this case, it seems that the investigators have succeeded, by making a popular film about the Talpiot tomb, in renewing a debate among Biblical scholars, statisticians, and archaeologists about the nature of the Talpiot tomb.On the downside, there are elements of sensationalism to the film, and there is no real attempt to cast serious doubt on the filmmakers' thesis. After watching the film, if one wants to follow current academic discussions of the Talpiot tomb, James Tabor's blog is a place to go (Tabor is one of the experts who appears in the film, and he seems inclined to favor the film's thesis).
