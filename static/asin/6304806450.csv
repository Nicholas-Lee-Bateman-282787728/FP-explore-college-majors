The bad guy, Michael Rappaport, is especially well known from other similar roles. So do expect some nasty treatment to people. I for one kept expecting his partner or girlfriend to be killed. I wasn't exactly on the edge of my seat, but you will have to wait till the end to see if they survive. The rest the cast does a good job of support.I paid about half of what Amazon is selling this movie for so I don't feel cheated at all. I bought this for little more than the price of a rental so I went in with few expectations. With Eddie Murphy in it I figured I wasn't taking much of a chance. I was glad to see I was right. There are several other recognizable people in the cast. Picture and sound quality was excellent. The directing, sets, and music are all as good as you will see in most movies. I imagine if it had just a little better story with more Murphy comedic antics it might have been a hit. This is pretty much a serious role.

Eddie Murphy hasn't made any good movies in years (unless you count his voiceover in Shrek) and is still living off his reputation from Saturday Night Live and 48 Hours and those were a LONG time ago.Basically, a &quot;This Time It's Personal!&quot; thriller about a hostage negotiator who turns homicide detective -- breaking all the ...uh...rules, pissing off his boss, etc. -- when his partner is killed by a master jewel thief (Michael Wincott). There is a hint of something interesting (maybe in an earlier draft of the script?) when the jewel thief is initially introduced as a kind of gentleman crook,a mild-mannered jazz buff and for about five minutes you think that maybe something clever and sophisticated will develop here. But the thief quickly metamorphized into a psychotic killer who stages his theft as an ordinary smash-and-grab event with lots of carnage and hostages taken. (Think about how STUPID this is, to draw this kind of attention to your crime and how it just about ensures you will not make a clean getaway and that the police will pursue you endlessly.)After the thief is captured, he makes an improbable escape and goes after Murphy's beautiful girlfriend, although there is not the slightest way he could have known who Murphy was dating, let alone where she lived. A dumb, silly plot device and one that has been used and used and used, especially on TV, so it's REALLY tired in a big budget film.Similarly, hints that Murphy's character has a gambling problem and money problems are presented and then disappear as if they also belonged to earlier (and better) drafts of the script.Trust me, you will forget this one even before your VCR finishes rewinding. A COMPLETE waste of an otherwise talented cast.
