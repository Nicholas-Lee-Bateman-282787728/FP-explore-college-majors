1461875,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B005IKD6ZS,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[18, 18]","A fun and lovely Christmas story, `G'-Good for all Generations. Mandie (Kelly Washington) is secretly  Cherokee because the period holds a prejudice. She's needing learning, etiquette, and social status ways. She struggles with rules. Her roommate at Heathwood's School for Girls in NC, Polly (Amanda Waters) is more typically the upper crust expected at the school. Joanna Daniel plays the headmistress Heathwood well, being this story's Grinch. There's a secret behind her attitude to Christmas, and it is hidden in the off-limits attic. Attics can hold lots of scary and surprising things, as the film proves. The film has several youth actors, the occasional overacted scene, but overall, it's quite believable and heartwarming.A superb actress first timer, Joy Chapman plays Miss Prudence, an adult helper with the schoolgirls. Amazingly she has other duties including: Director, Producer, Writer, & Editor. She's not the only multi-tasker. Owen Smith is Prod., Writer, orig music, & Cinematography. Ken Smith acts as Farmer Earl after having built sets. It's a family affair in story and reality. That's what makes these low-budget films to endearing. Not always perfect Hollywood, but close enough and hats off to the cast and crew. Well done!I've not read the books by Lois Gladys Leppard. All I can review is the film, not how closely it is adapted. I expect the spirit of the author's theme is realized. The film's overall theme seems to be HOPE at Christmas. A hint at faith-based characters. There is also effort given to demonstrate the unfairness of prejudice of all types. Mandie lies for a good cause--is that right? She's also cleverly deceitful at times, causing humor. Sometimes the beautiful scenery, even looks at period props including many quilts, offer as much interest as the mystery of the attic.SUBTITLES (CC) ARE AVAILABLE. Bonus is big. 60min behind scenes; 14min bloopers; 1600 photos `that's a lot'; 7 trailers; and guides. Feature is 107min. filmed in GA representing NC.Some historical Christmas sweetness, via story and visuals, as tasty as Figgie Pudding. I'm now ordering ""Mandie & the Secret Tunnel""-2009 & ""Mandie & the Cherokee Treasure""-2010. My wife is considering looking into the books, after enjoying ""Mandie and the Forgotten Christmas.""She said the film is a 5 star, and I have to agree. Don't rent, it's a keeper, a new viewing tradition.",5,Family viewing 1900 Christmas drama- WARNING: HEARTWARMING,1320969600,"11 11, 2011",2011,2385,"['fun', 'lovely', 'Christmas', 'story', ""G'-Good"", 'Generations', 'Mandie', 'Kelly', 'Washington', 'secretly', 'Cherokee', 'period', 'prejudice', 'needing', 'learning', 'etiquette', 'social', 'status', 'ways', 'rules', 'roommate', 'Heathwood', 'School', 'Girls', 'NC', 'Polly', 'Amanda', 'Waters', 'more', 'typically', 'upper', 'crust', 'expected', 'school', 'Joanna', 'Daniel', 'headmistress', 'Heathwood', 'well', 'being', 'story', 'Grinch', 'secret', 'attitude', 'Christmas', 'hidden', 'off-limits', 'attic', 'Attics', 'can', 'hold', 'lots', 'scary', 'surprising', 'things', 'film', 'film', 'several', 'youth', 'actors', 'occasional', 'overacted', 'scene', 'overall', 'quite', 'believable', 'heartwarming.A', 'superb', 'actress', 'first', 'timer', 'Joy', 'Chapman', 'Miss', 'Prudence', 'adult', 'helper', 'schoolgirls', 'Amazingly', 'other', 'duties', 'including', 'Director', 'Producer', 'Writer', 'Editor', 'not', 'only', 'multi-tasker', 'Owen', 'Smith', 'Prod.', 'Writer', 'orig', 'music', 'Cinematography', 'Ken', 'Smith', 'Farmer', 'Earl', 'having', 'built', 'sets', 'family', 'affair', 'story', 'reality', 'what', 'low-budget', 'films', 'endearing', 'Not', 'always', 'perfect', 'Hollywood', 'close', 'enough', 'hats', 'cast', 'crew', 'Well', 'done', ""'ve"", 'not', 'read', 'books', 'Lois', 'Gladys', 'Leppard', 'can', 'review', 'film', 'not', 'how', 'closely', 'adapted', 'expect', 'spirit', 'author', 'theme', 'realized', 'film', 'overall', 'theme', 'be', 'HOPE', 'Christmas', 'hint', 'faith-based', 'characters', 'also', 'effort', 'given', 'demonstrate', 'unfairness', 'prejudice', 'types', 'Mandie', 'good', 'cause', 'right', 'also', 'cleverly', 'deceitful', 'times', 'causing', 'humor', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'even', 'period', 'props', 'including', 'many', 'quilts', 'offer', 'as', 'much', 'interest', 'mystery', 'attic.SUBTITLES', 'CC', 'ARE', 'AVAILABLE', 'Bonus', 'big', '60min', 'scenes', '14min', 'bloopers', '1600', 'photos', 'lot', '7', 'trailers', 'guides', 'Feature', '107min', 'filmed', 'GA', 'representing', 'NC.Some', 'historical', 'Christmas', 'sweetness', 'story', 'visuals', 'as', 'tasty', 'Figgie', 'Pudding', ""'m"", 'now', 'ordering', 'Mandie', 'Secret', 'Tunnel', '-2009', 'Mandie', 'Cherokee', 'Treasure', '-2010', 'wife', 'considering', 'looking', 'books', 'enjoying', 'Mandie', 'Forgotten', 'Christmas', 'said', 'film', '5', 'star', 'have', 'agree', 'Do', ""n't"", 'rent', 'keeper', 'new', 'viewing', 'tradition']",Mandie and the Forgotten Christmas
