184816,AVW4ZUR0324BE,1567301738,"Amazon Customer ""Chris Hudson""","[4, 6]","Prior to watching this documentary I had changed my mind and gone back and forth several times on the whole Waco incident.  On the one hand, David Koresh struck me as being unstable to say the least, and the Branch Davidians' interpretation of the bible seemed to be completely out in left field.  But on the other hand, the ATF's raid and the subsequent siege seemed to be an unnecessary amount of force given that there were women and children inside, and that Koresh could have easily been apprehended on one of his many trips into town.So when I watched Waco The Rules of Engagement I did so with a genuine interest in learning more and trying to reach a decision based on the facts.  Now that I have seen this documentary I am convinced that the ATF was responsible for a horrible tragedy, and that the government hearings afterwards were a disgrace.Charles Schumer in particular, comes across as though he has some kind of agenda to discredit and ridicule anyone who disagrees with or questions the raid in any way.  His treatment of two defense attorneys, one of whom was a combat veteran and military judge, was shameful.  Also after watching those proceedings one wonders why the government brought out a young girl to testify that child abuse had taken place in Koresh's compound, when child abuse was not even the reason for the raid; those charges had already been investigated and dismissed, and the raid was supposedly about guns.  Also, why did the ATF have a secretary call the Dallas media before the raid to get a weekend point of contact, just in case there was a story?  It seems obvious that the ATF intended to raid the compound primarily for the media attention.  It is also interesting that the surviving Branch Davidians were all acquitted of the murder charges afterwards in a court of law.  There are many other disturbing facts in this documentary; facts that can't be denied because you are seeing them with your own eyes and hearing them with your own ears.  In closing, I think that although the Branch Davidians were certainly unusual by most peoples' standards, that in and of itself is not a crime, and what happened to them is a real shame.",5,Raises some points that are disturbing,1139702400,"02 12, 2006",2006,2175,"['Prior', 'watching', 'documentary', 'had', 'changed', 'mind', 'gone', 'back', 'forth', 'several', 'times', 'whole', 'Waco', 'incident', 'one', 'hand', 'David', 'Koresh', 'struck', 'being', 'unstable', 'say', 'least', 'Branch', 'Davidians', 'interpretation', 'bible', 'seemed', 'be', 'completely', 'left', 'field', 'other', 'hand', 'ATF', 'raid', 'subsequent', 'siege', 'seemed', 'be', 'unnecessary', 'amount', 'force', 'given', 'were', 'women', 'children', 'Koresh', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'apprehended', 'one', 'many', 'trips', 'town.So', 'when', 'watched', 'Waco', 'Rules', 'Engagement', 'did', 'so', 'genuine', 'interest', 'learning', 'more', 'trying', 'reach', 'decision', 'based', 'facts', 'Now', 'have', 'seen', 'documentary', 'am', 'convinced', 'ATF', 'was', 'responsible', 'horrible', 'tragedy', 'government', 'hearings', 'afterwards', 'were', 'disgrace.Charles', 'Schumer', 'particular', 'kind', 'agenda', 'discredit', 'ridicule', 'anyone', 'who', 'questions', 'raid', 'way', 'treatment', 'two', 'defense', 'attorneys', 'one', 'whom', 'was', 'combat', 'veteran', 'military', 'judge', 'was', 'shameful', 'Also', 'watching', 'proceedings', 'one', 'wonders', 'why', 'government', 'brought', 'out', 'young', 'girl', 'testify', 'child', 'abuse', 'had', 'taken', 'place', 'Koresh', 'compound', 'when', 'child', 'abuse', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'reason', 'raid', 'charges', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'investigated', 'dismissed', 'raid', 'was', 'supposedly', 'guns', 'Also', 'why', 'did', 'ATF', 'have', 'secretary', 'call', 'Dallas', 'media', 'raid', 'get', 'weekend', 'point', 'contact', 'just', 'case', 'was', 'story', 'obvious', 'ATF', 'intended', 'raid', 'compound', 'primarily', 'media', 'attention', 'also', 'interesting', 'surviving', 'Branch', 'Davidians', 'were', 'acquitted', 'murder', 'charges', 'afterwards', 'court', 'law', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'disturbing', 'facts', 'documentary', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'denied', 'are', 'seeing', 'own', 'eyes', 'hearing', 'own', 'ears', 'closing', 'think', 'Branch', 'Davidians', 'were', 'certainly', 'unusual', 'most', 'peoples', 'standards', 'not', 'crime', 'what', 'happened', 'real', 'shame']",N/A

I remember that other people were present, but what I remember most was the silence. No one said a word while we watched the flames leap higher and higher. The only thing I do remember hearing was &quot;this isn't happening.&quot; The sad truth is that it did happen, and a lot of work has gone into covering up the &quot;whole&quot; story. The government's version of events has been told time and time again, but the Branch Davidian's side has been at best marginalized or at worst ridiculed. This documentary will leave you shaking your head, wondering what really happened. Why did the ATF feel the need to stage such an over-the-top spectacle when David Koresh could have been arrested outside the compound? Why were news agencies given advance notice of the raid? What made government officials (who regularly referred to Koresh and his followers as mentally imbalanced) think that the children would be released? Where were all the guns and ammunition the Branch Davidians had stockpiled? Many of my questions were not answered as completely as I wanted, but the even sadder truth we have to face is that we probably will never know the &quot;whole&quot; story.

184824,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,1567301738,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 3]","Obviously, not enough people have seen this documentary.  If they had, the Waco ""incident"" at the Branch Davidian compound in 1993 would not be the ancient history it has become today.  When the event played out with the fiery destruction of the compound and most of the ""cultists"" inside, I didn't question the government's story that David Koresh led a dangerous cult that ultimately chose to commit mass suicide.  I no longer believe that.  I don't see how anyone could believe that after watching Waco: The Rules of Engagement.  I don't know if the FBI set the fire intentionally, but I'm convinced they did set the fire and prevented a number of the Branch Davidians from escaping the inferno.  If nothing else, the government told Congress and the American people numerous lies about the Waco tragedy in what must now be seen as a pretty successful cover-up of their own mistakes and/or crimes.  In this documentary, you will see how the government's own evidence clearly contradicts FBI, ATF, and other government agencies' testimony and, much more disheartening, even some of the assumptions making up the official record.While Waco: The Rules of Engagement obviously leans toward a conspiracy interpretation of events, the documentary actually does a pretty good job of stating both sides of the testimony and analysis.  There is far too much information for me to even begin summarizing it.  You'll hear from ATF, FBI, and Justice department agents and other government officials; Branch Davidian members (including some of the few survivors of the fire) and professionals who stepped up to defend them; a number of experts (including some former government employees) critical of different aspects of the operation; and you'll even hear from numerous of the slain Branch Davidians themselves on video recordings made inside the compound during the siege, videos that were initially suppressed by the government.  You'll hear recordings of 911 tapes and negotiations between Koresh's group and government negotiators and watch the damning surveillance tape of the fateful assault on the compound that puts the lie to the government's cover story.  You will also see some disturbing pictures of the burned bodies of a number of Branch Davidians, one of which - the charred body of a young girl - shows the torturous effects of cyanide (a byproduct of CS gas) on the human body (more evidence that the government never wanted the public to see).  You will also gain great insight into the aggressive mindset espoused by government forces seemingly determined to exact some measure of revenge on Koresh and his followers.Let me say that I am not a fan of David Koresh or his teachings.  I don't understand why a man of God would be involved with gun dealership (although I'm not convinced any of the guns in the compound were technically illegal), and I do believe he engaged in sex with underage females.  Once the raid commenced, however, I think almost all culpability lies with the government.  It seems pretty evident to me that the ATF fired the first shots - and fired from the air as well as the ground.  Even the search warrant is highly suspect - dominated by abuse charges that were not in the ATF's jurisdiction and then citing the wrong gun law code it was supposed to be enforcing.  The excessive use of force was ill-conceived and unwarranted, and, given the fact the ATF was in full PR mode but had to rely on reporters to call for ambulances, seemingly designed to put on a good show with an eye toward upcoming budget decisions.  In terms of the FBI's siege-ending actions, I find it appalling for government forces to fire CS gas into a population including many young children.  I obviously question why a plan to inject CS gas into the compound had to involve the destruction of walls and buildings, creating the very conditions that allowed fire to spread throughout the compound so rapidly.Whatever faith you have in the official government story cannot survive the analysis of the FLIR infrared surveillance video taken from the air during the April 19 assault.  An expert who helped design the surveillance technology takes you through one example after another of agents firing on the compound during the tank assault - this includes the sight of gunfire coming from two sources at the only exit point for many of the Branch Davidians seeking to escape the inferno.  You can see all of this for yourself, as the DVD includes all of the applicable FLIR footage along with 25 minutes of the 911 call the Branch Davidians placed during the initial attack.  After watching this documentary (which won an Emmy for Outstanding Investigative Journalism and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary), I have no choice but to believe that the American government murdered - either directly or indirectly - David Koresh and his followers.",5,A documentary of paradigm-shifting significance,1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,4876,"['Obviously',

184825,A1GQQFTPA23Z1O,1567301738,Dave,"[11, 12]","This has got to be the most disturbing film I've ever seen in my life. By the end of the documentary I was shaking my head in disgust...at my own government. The Waco Massacre (let's face it, that's what it was) was one of the darkest moments in American history, yet for years afterwards the public was grossly misled by lies from the FBI, ATF, and other government agencies. This shocking film shows the devastating truth behind the tragedy that killed 76 men, women, and children of the Branch Davidian religious sect as well as four federal agents.Countless times after the massacre took place, federal agents insisted that during the siege no one fired live ammunition at the compound where the Branch Davidians were under siege. This is proven to be a lie by the footage filmed from helicopters which shows automatic weapons being fired at the compound even as men, women, and children were fleeing for their lives from the raging fire, which was started by the tanks. Tanks had rolled over graves of dead Davidians during the siege, the agents had played deafening music all through the night, and played loud sounds of animals being slaughtered, as well as flashing bright lights at the compound to keep the tired men, women, and children awake. The tanks released an overwhelming amount of gas into the compound which resulted in countless deaths. One of the most sickening images I've ever seen in my life is the photo shown in this documentary of the charred body of an eight-year-old girl that is horribly twisted and contorted from the effects on the nervous system by the gas.There's also evidence that at one point the tanks were actually driving over people in the compound. How could our government come to this?!? I don't agree with the bizarre religious beliefs or sexual practices of the Branch Davidians and their leader but none of them deserved to be murdered like they were. This jaw-dropping documentary has footage showing interviews with Branch Davidians that was taken during the siege. It also has footage of the many investigations that took place afterwards. It is easily one of the most extraordinary documentaries ever made and should be required viewing for every American citizen.",5,A sickening wake-up call to the people of America!,1115769600,"05 11, 2005",2005,2215,"['got', 'be', 'most', 'disturbing', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'end', 'documentary', 'was', 'shaking', 'head', 'disgust', 'own', 'government', 'Waco', 'Massacre', 'let', 'face', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'one', 'darkest', 'moments', 'American', 'history', 'yet', 'years', 'public', 'was', 'grossly', 'misled', 'lies', 'FBI', 'ATF', 'other', 'government', 'agencies', 'shocking', 'film', 'devastating', 'truth', 'tragedy', 'killed', '76', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'Branch', 'Davidian', 'religious', 'sect', 'as', 'well', 'four', 'federal', 'agents.Countless', 'times', 'massacre', 'took', 'place', 'federal', 'agents', 'insisted', 'siege', 'one', 'fired', 'live', 'ammunition', 'compound', 'where', 'Branch', 'Davidians', 'were', 'siege', 'proven', 'be', 'lie', 'footage', 'filmed', 'helicopters', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'being', 'fired', 'compound', 'even', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'were', 'fleeing', 'lives', 'raging', 'fire', 'was', 'started', 'tanks', 'Tanks', 'had', 'rolled', 'over', 'graves', 'dead', 'Davidians', 'siege', 'agents', 'had', 'played', 'deafening', 'music', 'night', 'played', 'loud', 'sounds', 'animals', 'being', 'slaughtered', 'as', 'well', 'flashing', 'bright', 'lights', 'compound', 'keep', 'tired', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'awake', 'tanks', 'released', 'overwhelming', 'amount', 'gas', 'compound', 'resulted', 'countless', 'deaths', 'One', 'most', 'sickening', 'images', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'photo', 'shown', 'documentary', 'charred', 'body', 'eight-year-old', 'girl', 'horribly', 'twisted', 'contorted', 'effects', 'nervous', 'system', 'gas.There', 'also', 'evidence', 'one', 'point', 'tanks', 'were', 'actually', 'driving', 'over', 'people', 'compound', 'How', 'could', 'government', 'come', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'bizarre', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'sexual', 'practices', 'Branch', 'Davidians', 'leader', 'none', 'deserved', 'be', 'murdered', 'were', 'jaw-dropping', 'documentary', 'footage', 'showing', 'interviews', 'Branch', 'Davidians', 'was', 'taken', 'siege', 'also', 'footage', 'many', 'investigations', 'took', 'place', 'afterwards', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'documentaries', 'ever', 'made', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'American', 'citizen']",N/A

When you think of David Koresh and the Branch Davidians you probably think, ""head nutjob who brainwashed a group of religious fanatics to kill themselves..."" Am I right?  I admit I thought the same thing.  Considering the press coverage we were being fed, is it any wonder?  I remember one of the major networks was busy creating a Waco movie before the standoff even ended.Listen to the tapes of the negotiations between the FBI and the compound members.  Watch the tapes and see the footage from numerous sources showing how highly flammable and combustible CS gas was injected into the compound.  And most damning of all, watch the FLIR tapes that show FBI agents firing automatic weapons on the compound as the gas was set ablaze.Opinions may vary, and that's the purpose of intelligent debate, but it's the opinion of this viewer that Waco was not an incident, but a massacre -- a deliberate and premeditated assassination performed by our government against our own people.  Even more disturbing is how our elected officials, after having viewed the same footage in congressional hearings, moved swiftly to dismiss any possibility that the FBI acted in error.Think I'm exaggerating or overreacting?

184827,A3MCC5MAJYJYMD,1567301738,Dhaval Vyas,"[9, 9]","Many people remember the Waco standoff that occured a long time ago.  What most people probably have ingrained in their minds is the ""cult leader"" David Koresh and the images of the compound burning to the ground after a long standoff.  A lot of people have the belief that Koresh was some kind of madman who thought he was God.  He was accused of being a child molester and was credited for the breakdown and deaths of his followers.  Furthermore, many people feel the cult committed mass suicide when the FBI stormed Mount Carmel Center and when the building was burning.  Most people feel the cult was at fault for not agreeing with the FBI on reasonable terms.  Most people feel the cult was brainwashed by Koresh and followed along with everything that he said.  Nothing could be farther from the truth, because of strong evidence after the nightmare was over, and this one-of -a- kind documentary pretty much proves it!!This documentary is one of the most balanced examinations at the situation that occured.  It is much more thorough and highly detailed than anything most people have received in the mainstream media.  To the shock of many people, this documentary will reveal that is was the ATF, the FBI, and the higher levels of the United States government who were the ones who were unjust, cruel, and deceptive, and not David Koresh and his followers.  What Korseh and Davidians were doing was just protecting their constitutional rights, and the higher powers completely violated and raped those rights.  The AFT had no grounds to storm the compound; it was the AFT that shot first and they shot from the helicopters from above at unarmed men, women, and children!!  What is even more shocking is the actions of the FBI when they entered the Mount Carmel.  Watch it for yourselves and you will develop and new perspective on the U.S. government.  There is infrared footage that clearly shows the FBI was shooting with machine guns at the men, women, and children in the burning compound.  It will make your blood boil.  It will make you really angry.  It will make you wonder as to what kind of people run this country.  Finally, it will make you wonder as to what you are being told on the news every night is the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

What disturbed me most about this true story is that before I saw this film, I too was one of the millions who swallowed the Government's sugar coated account of what happened in Waco. The Government portrayed Koresh as a gun-runner, child molester and cult leader. While there may have been some truth to the child molestation charges, the ATF Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) had absolutely no jurisdiction to arrest, engage or even serve a search warrant to Koresh on those charges. The ATF comes off as ultra-corrupt publicity hounds who tried to use the Branch Davidians to further justify their continued funding and existance. I mean, a high ranking ATF official contacted 2 different news stations and ""alerted"" them that ""something big"" may happen around Waco in the next two days. Under examination by Congress when asked if the sole reason for this action was to garner publicity for the ATF, the woman answers UNDER OATH ""No, that was in no way the intention"". The Branch Davidians had no choice but to defend themselves from the onslaught of ATF agents who randomly began firing on their compound. The result of 4 dead ATF agents set the wheels in motion for the biggest Government cover-up since the Watergate scandal. The horrifying images of the dead, charred women and children are some of the most disturbing pictures I have ever viewed. Bodies twisted, bones snapped from the CS gas that the FBI shot into the compound basically into the lap of the women and children who were hiding in the concrete kitchen. Yet, the FBI and ATF insist that the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide by starting fire to the compound. It is clearly documented that the combination of combustible chemicals shot into the compound along with the destruction of the structure by tanks caused fireballs to engulf the compound within seconds killing almost everyone inside. **WE NEED MORE FILMS LIKE WACO: THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT TO OPEN PEOPLES EYES AS TO HOW FAR REACHING THE CORRUPTION WITHIN OUR GOVERNMENT REACHES.

Little,"[1, 4]","I still don't know what happened at Waco..I don't believe there was a massive government cover-up, and I don't think either side was wholly good or wholly evil. What I think is that poor choices were made, and these poor choices escalated beyond the control of the institutions and governmental forces who laid siege to the Davidians. When you boil away the rhetoric and the mischaracterizations you realize that the people inside that compound were American citizens, and no matter what had made the Federal government turn its eye towards them it was not worth their wholesale slaughter.This documentary can be called many things, but I don't think it is necessarily inflammatory. It leaves you with a doubt about the decisions made by the BATF, the FBI and the Justice Department, and it makes you wonder if there were rogue individuals within those groups who took things too far and pressured the Davidians with undue force. The Davidians protected their home from what they felt was an unlawful attempt to enter by the BATF based on the force used, the BATF escalated the conflict, lost officers and then were forced to withdraw when they ran out of ammo. The death of those officers made it a federal investigation requiring the FBI's involvement....and things went from bad to worse.The event was tragic, but worse was the aftermath and investigation. The horrific loss of life was dismissed as mass suicide, the agencies involved were exonerated and the myth of the Davidian ""Cult"" was perpetuated. The men who knew what had happened, who knew their personal bias had escalated this confrontation to a bloody and unnecessary conclusion kept silent and thus tarnished themselves and their agencies forever and compromised the basic freedoms we Americans cherish above all else.We are free to speak our minds and worship as we believe without fear of reprisal or intimidation from a suspicious government. This documentary will lay out a lot of the events of the siege and the testimonies to Congress after the events had transpired, and while it argues distinctively in favor of the Davidians I don't have a problem with that since while they lived they were demonized by all but those who actually knew them.

But ""Waco, The Rules of Engagement"" almost makes me want to take up the old, bloody standard again. The film works mainly by juxtaposing the images we saw on TV- long shots of the jerry-rigged compound, government talking heads, circling helicopters - with images and sounds we did not see. In particular, that would be the films and audio tapes of David Koresh, his followers and his negotiators recorded during the siege. The film also sets testimony by FBI and ATF agents against images that seemingly discredit their testimony. When an FBI agent claims that no shots were fired by his agency is intercut with infrared film that appears to show automatic fire being directed against the buildings, something is dreadfully wrong.There is much that is fishy about the government's claims about Waco. The stories are too pat and the crucial evidence has conveniently disappreared. The compound's front door, which the Davidians claimed would show incoming fire, is missing. Tapes of the early moments of ATF's attack are supposedly blank. And the evidence that does exist is spun into self-serving shapes. That many of the were dead found shot in a bunker is taken as proof of the cult's urge to suicide, murder or executions. The idea that people being slowly gassed and burned to death might be desperate enough to commit mercy killings is not considered. The grotesquely contorted bodies of young children are consistent with cyanide formed from the ignition of CS gas is not the fault of the government, which pumped the compound full of noxious chemicals, but that of mothers who could not summon up enough maternal feelings for the kids.The film doesn't show evidence that government agencies planned to exterminate the Davidians. That would require a level of planning and coordination that seems beyond them But at the very least, a spirit of revenge informed the climate at Waco. The deaths of 4 ATF officers and the wounding of 20 others in the badly-planned February 28 raid called for a definitive response. The sense of fatigue and embarrassment at the 51-day siege, and of the seeming difficulty of talking the Davidians out combined to create the need for action. If anything, the government's one-sided story that it fired no shots, and made no mistakes is just unbelievable. Reports that the cult was abusing children, using drugs and stockpiling machine guns and hand grenades seems contrived to demonize those inside and to legitimize whatever action was taken against them.I was impressed by the wide array of people who spoke on behalf of the Davidians, usually considered a wacky, ornery and unlikeable lot. There are defense lawyers, a local sheriff, bible scholars, Texas Rangers, the survivors of the raid, an FBI forensic photographer and the man who developed the infrared technology used by the government to catalog the raid. Altogether, this array of witnesses, in addition to the haunting voices, via videotape, of the dead Davidians, slowly but surely undermines the government's case. Whatever the people inside were, aand no matter how misguided they might have been, they were not monsters.Rules of Engagement has flaws. It uses innuendo and selective editing far too often to show the government as evil and the Davidians as peaceful Bible readers just protecting their turf.  The missing front door might have shown the direction in which bullets flew, but would not have proven who shot first. Infrared images of a fire starting just after a tank left the grounds does not prove who started the fire -- whether it started inadvertently, by incendiary devices lobbed into the compound by agents or by the Davidianss themselves. True, government agents might have fired into the compound, but what were they firing at, and why? The film suggests they were firing at people trying to escape the burning compound, but this goes beyond what the film shows. Worst, the film neatly expunges the apocalyptic beliefs of the Davidians, who fully expected a showdown with ""Babylon,"" the symbol of their powerful enemy. It is suggestive that when the raid began, regardless of who fired first, the Davidians were ready for them and killed 4 and injured 20 of their attackers. Readers  of other Waco books (notably ""The Ashes of Waco"" by Dick Reavis) will note the many truly scary aspects of the Davidian belief system that did not make it into this movie.Unforgiveable, at about the 2-hour mark, the film assaults the viewer with gruesome, close-up, full-color images of the burned corpses of some of the fire's victims. AT the very least, the filmmakers might have included a warning.Still, the film left me wanting to know more about the siege, and what made it go so terribly wrong. While I don't ascribe to the belief that this film shows What Our Government Is Capable Of. Most of the agents, after all are ordinary, law-abiding citizens. But there is something terribly awry with powerful federal agents who, armed only with military gear, decide to use it against outgunned opponents whose motives and mindset they scarcely comprehend. An important film, if viewed in the context of less inflammatory viewpoints.",4,"Smart film, useful evidence, some questionable conclusions",1278892800,"07 12, 2010",2010,5229,"[""'d"", 'like',

184833,A332MW6OA1LYDF,1567301738,John Noodles,"[5, 6]","This is a shocking and disturbing movie.  Watching it, you get the sense that the ATF and FBI missed no opportunity to screw up at Waco, and to lie about it afterwards.  Neither did the politicians who investigated it. Did they?  I'll have to learn more about it before I decide.Since I don't really know any details about Waco that were not presented in this movie, it's impossible for me to judge it in terms of its accuracy.  It is possible that the filmmakers chose the most damning footage from the Senate hearings, and various Waco &quot;experts.&quot;  Chuck Schumer, John Conyers, Shiela Jackson, Joseph Biden...they come off sounding like apologists for what (if this movie is correct) is the worst slaughter of American citizens by its government since Wounded Knee.  Now, knowing Schumer, and his smarmy, arrogant, ideological self-righteousness, and Conyers' mindless gun-hating knee-jerk liberalism, and Janet Reno's, well, daffiness, this wouldn't necessarily be hard to believe.But still, it is...I mean, the evidence in this movie seems SO compelling, and so heart-wrenching, that Schumer and company would have to be barbarians not to want to hold the responsible parties accountable.  Were Democrats merely trying to insulate the Clinton administration from blame?  It seems to stretch plausibilty that even the likes of Schumer would try to excuse mass murder.  Who knows. Not I.Some compelling facts surface in this movie.  Remarkably,  the ATF refused an invitation from Koresh to inspect his licensed weaponry.  Instead, for some reason, they chose to serve him with a search warrant by showing up with truckloads of heavily-armed agents, helicopters, and so forth.  It remains unclear who fired first.  The Davidians insist the ATF did.  The ATF insists the Davidians did.  While it's possible the filmmakers were biased, there do seem to be some pretty irrefutable facts suggesting the government lied...and lied wildly.  In fact, at one point we hear a negotiator lying to Koresh, over and over, about the presence of gun on one of the helicopters that fired on Davidians. The negotiator insists that there were no guns on the helicopter, and Koresh keeps telling him he saw them firing on him and the others.  Finally the negotiator admits that the agents on the helicopter were armed, but there were no MOUNTED guns on the helicopter...like that makes all the difference.  Also, infrared film seems to show FBI agents firing into a burning building as they back away, and as Davidians burn to death inside that building...yet they claim they never fired a single shot.Local law enforcement spoke highly of Koresh.  He certainly doesn't seem to be the child-molesting, whacked-out, violent drug dealing crminial that the government made him out to be in order to head off criticism for their attack.  He and the rest of the Davidians are odd, yes, but the Davidians that the filmmakers present are not the brainwashed cult members they've been made out to be.  Does being odd, and owning a lot of guns warrant having the ATF stomp all over you?  Are we not supposed to, uh, celebrate diversity?The movie implies--or interviews people who imply--that there was a government conspiracy to murder the Davidians.  I remain unconvinced.  The massacre at Waco seems like a series of mistakes (understandable in tense, dangerous situations, if not excuseable), and cover-ups.This movie is a must-see.

So the saying goes, and the fate of the Branch Davidians at the hands of the Clinton/Reno Justice Department is a perfect example.The attack on the Mt. Carmel compound, at Waco, Texas, began as an attempt by the Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms division of Treasury to make an example of the religious cult known as the Branch Davidians and their leader David Koresh, and to achieve some favorable publicity after the black eye it had got from the public from its heavy handed treatment at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, where agents shot and killed an innocent woman holding an infant, the family dog and the teenage boy in the family when they stumbled upon the agents surveiling the property in the surrounding woods.At Ruby Ridge, the motive of the federal agents was that the husband and father refused their offer to serve as an undercover snitch for them in the local community of white supremacists.  To induce him to do so, they had an undercover man get him to cut down a shotgun to an illegal length.  It was an inadvertent eighth of an inch shorter than the legal length.  His refusal to cooperate brought the wrath of the government down on his head, and the FBI in to back up the ATF.  It was an FBI sniper who shot his wife to death in the doorway of their home, while she held their infant to her breast.At Waco, they had unsubstantiated information that the Branch Davidians possessed some fully automatic weapons.  As it turned out, none were ever found in the ashes, but even if they had been, the ""crime"" was failure to pay a $200 tax required to own such weapons.  The ATF got a search warrant, and with it as their cover, rather than knock on the door and serve it, they went in shooting.Later, of course, they claimed sexual abuse, rape, and child abuse was their motive--crimes which they have absolutrely no legal authority to address since they are essentially tax collecting agents, and which in any event had already been investigated by the State of Texas with negative results.So, in a long, drawn out, mishandled, botched raid and its aftermath, which took days to resolve, they managed to kill nearly 100 men, women and children and burn the compound to the ground.The Congress of the United States whitewashed the whole event.  This video, however, documents the bureaucratic lies and misdeeds in great detail in great and damning detail, and demonstrates clearly why it is necessary for the people to have better sources of information than the major news media and the government.

184836,A2T049UQONS0OY,1567301738,Larry VanDeSande,"[2, 3]","This documentary seems a bit stilted but doubles the message I got from a book on the Branch Davidian episode in Waco, Texas in 1993. While sitting at my desk one day in 1994, where I edited a state government newsletter, I received an unsolicited book in the mail. That book was about Waco and presented an argument that David Koresh and his followers were essentially the victims of government intrusion because of their religious beliefs.This documentary presents an argument that is similar to what I read in 1994. It shows how Branch Davidians moved to Texas from California and had been organized in Waco for 50 years prior to the deadly episode in 1993. It discusses their religious beliefs, which are somewhat different interpreting certain sections of the book of Revelations discussion on the Seven Seals.It uses footage of Branch Davidians talking about their lives in Waco, and talks to the Waco sheriff about alleged crimes of child abuse among the Branch Davidians, which he says were never proven or justified. It presents Congressional testimony from the period following 1993 that presents a conflict between the government's illegal firearms case against the Branch Davidians, which was the basis of the ATF raids in February and April 1993.Were the Branch Davidians the victims of government intrusion in the extreme? FBI wiretap evidence now suggests the religious faction in question started the fire that doomed scores of people during the standoff with the FBI and federal authorities in 1993. This did not excuse the behavior of the FBI, which has since changed its tactics to ensure nonviolent approach is taken as long as possible. Former President Clinton, who was in power during these events, has since admitted the U.S. government acted improperly.The Waco event in 1993, coupled with Ruby Ridge the year before and the hated Clinton national health care initiative of that time combined to result in that miserable backward-looking U.S. Congress of 1994.

We forget that this tragedy occurred under President Clinton's watch and authorized by US Attorney General Janet Reno and executed by the FBI based on drummed up, unfounded charges of child abuse for the sole purpose of bringing the embarrassment to a close, regardless of the human cost and the lives of the children.  What was worse, like the fiasco surrounding the Randy Weaver/Ruby Ridge incident in Idaho, oppressive Federal power was used by over zealous Federal law enforcement officials to crush two groups of American citizens that did not meet their definition of &#34;normal and passive&#34;.  Moreover, the Feds used this power based on false reports by paid informants of alleged criminal activities; when the facts clearly established that the allegations were not only false but criminal.  For that reason, Randy Weaver, an Honorably Discharged former member of the US Army's Special Forces accused of violating Federal firearms laws, was acquitted on all charges but failure to appear and the resulting warrant for doing so.  Randy Weavers children were awarded more than $1,000,000.00 as a result of the FBI's and ATF's violation of the Weaver's civil rights and the Death of the the Weaver's infant baby and the murder of Weaver's wife and the mother of their children, Vicki.

(If there is a reason to question the legality of the search warrant, that's something you deal with in court, not by picking up your guns.)  After the initial gunfight -- with five dead ATF agents -- the remaining law enforcement personnel are not going away just because the Davidians thought they were in the right (and have to do something with their seven seals).  Sooner or later, the only option is surrender, and at some point, law enforcement will take some action to force a surrender.

Those revelations, in a nutshell, are as follows: that the ATF and FBI under the leadership of Janet Reno and the Clinton Administration murdered some 86 men, women and children after a 51 day siege. Now, that these allegations do not surprise me may say more about me than it does about the state of political reality in this country - I am willing to concede that - but this is a powerful piece of film making which goes a long way toward confirming any suspicions of corruption and &quot;Big Brotherism&quot; myself and like minded people may have entertained.I know nothing about the filmmakers - their political leanings, religious beliefs and favorite colors are a mystery to me - but it seems a fair bet they lean to the left. I make this observation because this film is thus far my only source of information regarding the Waco tragedy and I have no idea how objective it is or is not. It seems that there is a definite bias in favor of the Branch Davidians but, in light of the more than compelling evidence presented here against the ATF/FBI, the objectivity of the filmmakers almost seems a moot point. One of the more powerful pieces of this evidence is the testimony from the inventor of the FLIR infrared filming technology and the report of an independent lab, both stating that the film shot from an airplane during the raid of April 19, 1993 indicates automatic gunfire directed against the burning Branch Davidian &quot;compound&quot; - contrary to the FBI claim that their personnel fired no shots.Much contested also was the issue of who fired the first shots at the beginning of this whole sorry situation - the ATF or the Branch Davidians? This also is rendered a moot point, for me at least, by the fact that the government chose to issue a supposed search warrant (for illegal weapons) to David Koresh via a veritable army of ATF personnel in full combat gear. I don&#65533;t claim to be familiar with police procedure, much less the arcane workings of agencies like the ATF, but this seems to me like a show of force that is meant to be intimidating and confrontational. It seems perfectly clear that the authorities had no intention of resolving their issues with David Koresh (and these are issues that touch all of us profoundly &#65533; freedom of religion and the right to bear arms, for instance) in a peaceful manner.I have no sympathy with the teachings and lifestyle of the Branch Davidians. They may have broken some laws (and let us please consider that just because legislation is passed does not mean it is right) regarding weapons and, perhaps, underage sex. Whatever they did or did not do, the treatment they received at the hands of the FBI and ATF was inexcusable, shameful, and inhumane.Did the United States government willfully murder its own citizens with not even a semblance of due process in Waco in 1993? Until I find more compelling evidence to the contrary, I must, unfortunately, say yes.

184845,A1GZKHEQWTS4Z5,1567301738,Thomas Moody,"[1, 3]","We should be clear here...the onus of blame for this tragedy rests squarely on the shoulders of David Koresh. Regardless of evidence found and/or lost, Koresh was solely responsible, as their ""leader"", for the lives of his fellow Branch Davidians killed at the Mount Carmel compound in Waco on April 19th, 1993. Clearly engaged in the stockpiling of illegally altered weapons, along with demagogue-like behavior and polygamous character traits, his actions at every point in this standoff pointed to psychosis, guilt and cover up. When any normal citizen sees government officials, armed and racing toward their ""home"" with the obvious intent of searching, and IF they have nothing to hide, these citizens then have the obvious obligation to come out of their homes/compounds and not obstruct the subsequent search. This is only common sense. Instead, this madman opens fire, killing and wounding ATF agents in the process, which clearly and undoubtedly set the tone for the ensuing standoff. Koresh and Koresh alone was the only person who could have ended this without bloodshed and loss of life...he controlled the situation from the very beginning and the blood of those poor misguided people, his ""followers"", is on his hands.Conversely, is the U.S. Government, specifically the ATF and FBI, guilty of escalation of this crisis, instigation of unnecessary intimidation and (pathetically) cover-up? Absolutely...in fact, this film presents in fair and unbiased form, the profoundly tainted actions of these agencies on the world stage, showing that even with the highest offices in the government engaged in attempting to quell this storm, they still could not control the actions of the agents at the compound...indeed, even the agency leaders on the ground at the compound continued to assert afterward that NO firing of weapons on the government's part occurred throughout the standoff, while clear and discriminating evidence shows otherwise. This film then is an important and ground-breaking referendum on flawed government actions in controlling these demented psychotics and should be viewed by all citizens.Intertwining familiar news footage with rarely seen raw video from the Davidians inside Mount Carmel during the siege and overlaying it with recorded standoff conversations with Koresh and others, it is at once shocking while being informing...the filmmakers have created an important balance here as they are able to scorn the government actions while also showing the dementia that controlled Koresh. Starting with the initial invasion, the filmmakers are thorough and complete in their analysis of the events leading up to the standoff. Showing hard evidence that Vernon Howell (Koresh) was a master manipulator and sleazy self aggrandizer, we see him weaponizing his colony and spending great resources to alter the characteristics of these weapons, thus making them illegal. The debate starts right away as the invasion, initially set up as a determined effort to search the compound by the ATF, turns instead into a shootout...who shot first is the initial point in this conflict and the viewer is given both sides as video and interviews with experts abound.The standoff and subsequent fire, obviously, make up the rest of the movie as witness after witness is shown testifying before a congressional committee juxtaposed over the real time footage. Expert analysis of the government's actions to force an end to the stalemate show clearly that dubious tactics were used and misleading commentary on the part of the government officials on the ground were given as the official version in the daily news conferences. In fact, the film shows that the siege-ers were engaged in weapons fire, shady behavior and, importantly, misleading dialogue in relation to how the fire was initially set. The use of CS gas is explained by the officials in the news conferences while the film interviews experts who offer a very different version of said use and point out, feasibly, that the fire was very likely started by the injection of the gas along with other physical elements including temperatures, wind and the shabby physical makeup of the wooden compound. Using infrared video, the directors are ground breaking in their testimony that the tanks and agents on the ground were heinously guilty of shooting at the Davidians and, unbelievably, holding them hostage with gunfire in the compound bunker as they tried to escape the burning building. Using this infrared film along with the official video, one gets a layered and textured view of what really happened and it is shocking to say the least. Finally, I'm still convinced that Attorney General Reno was not given all the facts as to operations at the standoff and that had she had this information, perhaps a different outcome could still have been had My personal view is that she was almost criminally misinformed and mislead as to the actual occurrences at the compound but also as highest ranking law official in the country, ultimately responsible for their actions.A film truly worthy of all its accolades, Waco - The Rules of Engagement tells a complete and unbiased view of the terrible outcome of Waco. It is still as relevant today, 17 years after the event as it was in 1997 when it came out. Also, as an amateur researcher of this tragedy, it confirms my long held belief that Koresh was still ultimately responsible while, shockingly, also exposing the government for being, at best misleading or at worse, an uncaring and results oriented organization that attempted to use this standoff to show their power...shame on them!",5,Government obfuscation only exceeded by Koresh

The government had to go after those crazy cultists who were molesting children and stockpiling guns. It's a tragedy, but they were dangerous, weren't they?"" But this documentary shatters all of the official lies, reveals how much propaganda we were fed, and how unthinkingly the machinery of mass murder swings into action. And finally comes the banal and clumsy cover-up, which inevitably sways the minds of most potato-chip munching Americans, no matter how unbelievable it is.To me, some of the most unforgettable segments involve the ATF agents enthusiastically preparing for their initial raid, alerting the media, thinking they will have a trophy to show Congress for their appropriations hearings. Instead, they trudge away from the first encounter like a defeated army.Some have criticized this film for downplaying the role of the US military in training the ATF and FBI agents involved, and this is probably a fair criticism.

184847,AW7BIYHXUIZ62,1567301738,T.M. Reader,"[27, 29]","Please allow me to share my frank reaction and some random thoughts after viewing this film.The Waco/Branch Davidian matter has already became old news.  I went into a viewing of this with entertainment in mind, expecting a revelation on the order of ""there are Martian corpses at Area 51"", or ""9-11 was planned by George W Bush"".  What I came away with is the disgusting feeling that the federal government has committed a big crime, covered it up, and corporate media are a willing accomplice.  BTW - the ""Davidian"" aspect of this group's name takes root in the King David of the Old Testament, NOT in personality David Koresh.I have heretofore always believed, as I had been taught via TV, that the Branch Davidians were an anti-government, religious cultic sect, and that David Koresh was insane and held himself out as their ""messiah"" and/or the reincarnation of the Biblical Jesus.What I found in this film was that the Branch Davidians were a group of Christian Bible-scholars - of mixed race, gender, age, marital status - that possessed an above average dedication to wringing truth from the scriptures, and courage to NOT be lead by a mainstream religion ring through their nose.  What I saw in the film strongly indicates that this was NOT a Jim Jones Guyana situation (which did indeed have all the attributes of being a genuine wacky cult).  I disagree with some of Koresh's interpretations, but that is irrelevant.If I may speak plainly: When the Branch Davidians resisted government interference in the practice of their non-mainstream but definitely Biblical Christian religion . . . then U.S. government law enforcement agencies, headed by Clinton's Attorney General Janet Reno, so as not to lose face, recklessly murdered eighty-plus innocent men, women and children (I can't decide if it was accidental or not).  And then covered it up with the finesse of a bulldozer.This film production could have been more polished of course, but it was certainly better than the minmum necessary to get the story across.  I'm glad somebody did it.  The innocents who were slaughtered deserved to be de-villanized.  By the end of the video, I was close to tears.THAT is what I saw in the film.
