Koch, Henry Sanicola, Tony Lazzarino.Narrated by Jimmy Stewart.Based upon the experimental X-15 program at Edwards Air Force Base, California. The X-15 was the world's first rocket ship. It's first flight was recorded on June 8, 1959 and retired in December 1970. It was primarily used by the United States Air Force and NASA. It reached to the edge of outer space bringing back valuable data to use in aircraft and spacecraft design.The X-15 still holds the official world record for the highest speed ever reached by a manned aircraft, 4,520 miles per hour (7,274 km/h) (Mach 6.72).Only 3 of the North American X-15 rocket-powered aircrafts were built.This story of the X-15 is real. However, the pilots, the women and children and those in the control room are actors.Actually filmed at Edwards Air Force Base.The movie is tagged: Actually filmed in space.In the cast: David McLean, Charles Bronson, Mary Tyler Moore, Kenneth Tobey, James Gregory, Patricia Owens, Lisabeth Hush, Lauren Gilbert, Stanley Livingston, Patty McDonald, Ralph Taeger, Brad Dexter, Phil Dean, Chuck Stanford.Language in English.

Nothing could have been easier than to have re-worked this film in a full-frame version with the NASA footage sections returned to their original dimensions, which are naturally full-frame. You'd think it would have been a breeze with the available technology and software. Instead of being able to advertise a newly restored version that's better than the original theatrical release ever was, they end up with a DVD that's getting pathetic reviews and which isn't likely to sell. Sales from the corrected version would surely have offset the cost of the easy re-working of the film. The problem here lies with whoever is responsible for marketing this stuff.

789240,A1VZLLDNLURGJB,B0000YEEWQ,Keith Mirenberg,"[2, 3]","I had to go it alone in 1961 to see the grand opening of the X-15 story at the old ASCOT Theater in the Bronx. All of my friends, amateur rocket buddies and charter members of the New York Rocket Society would not go to see this then promising film and somehow had the intelligence to tell me not to waste my time. They were all eggheads and must have read some bad reviews in the NY Times.It was indeed a very bad movie about a great aircraft. Nevertheless, I  enjoyed the film even though the discussed wide screen problems hampered my viewing. It was the first full length movie to be released about the beginnings of the real space program and I was thrilled to see it. With the possible exception of ON THE THRESHOLD OF SPACE, an early film which documented the U.S. Air Force MAN-HIGH balloon project, the X-15 story is almost in a class by itself. It was a film about a rocket research project, and the featured characters were almost incidental.In order to appreciate my excitement about seeing this film you must understand that the X-15 had been spoken about since about 1957 when I was 11 years old. My first glimpse of the X-15 was in released Air Force photos that showed it covered by a large canvas which cloaked the exact shape of the rocket. This only permitted a tantalizing first impression of the shape of the X-15 and really helped capture my imagination.  I was a fan of this vehicle from that day forward, if such a thing can be said.The film story was about a rocket powered extreme altitude aircraft, and nothing in the movie except the actual Air Force footage of the X-15 was worth looking at. The X-15 went on to achieve a maximum altitude record of 67 miles and a velocity record of 6.7 times the speed of sound. Although function determined much of its form, the X-15 was also one of the most beautiful rocketplanes ever designed, and resembles the SR-71 in profile.The X-15 demonstrated the use of reaction attitude control jets, the application of Inconel X high temperature alloy, early Air Force pressure suit technology, a powerful and fully throttleable rocket engine, and did much of the pioneering research that made the space shuttle possible in later years.  Although it is seldom mentioned, the X-15 was one of the most successful research programs of the U.S. Air Force and NASA.According to what I have read it only failed to better its performance to Mach 8 as was hoped for and attempted. However, it did outperform most of its original specifications.  It also gave many of us something important to be proud of during the early days when America appeared to be falling behind the Russians in space flight capability.",2,X-15 (1961) A bad film about one of the greatest accomplishments of the U.S. Air Force,1236816000,"03 12, 2009",2009,2663,"['had', 'go', 'alone', '1961', 'see', 'grand', 'opening', 'X-15', 'story', 'old', 'ASCOT', 'Theater', 'Bronx', 'friends', 'amateur', 'rocket', 'buddies', 'charter', 'members', 'New', 'York', 'Rocket', 'Society', 'would', 'not', 'go', 'see', 'then', 'promising', 'film', 'somehow', 'had', 'intelligence', 'tell', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'were', 'eggheads', 'must', 'have', 'read', 'bad', 'reviews', 'NY', 'Times.It', 'was', 'indeed', 'very', 'bad', 'movie', 'great', 'aircraft', 'Nevertheless', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'even', 'discussed', 'wide', 'screen', 'problems', 'hampered', 'viewing', 'was', 'first', 'full', 'length', 'movie', 'be', 'released', 'beginnings', 'real', 'space', 'program', 'was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'possible', 'exception', 'ON', 'THE', 'THRESHOLD', 'OF', 'SPACE', 'early', 'film', 'documented', 'U.S.', 'Air', 'Force', 'MAN-HIGH', 'balloon', 'project', 'X-15', 'story', 'almost', 'class', 'was', 'film', 'rocket', 'research', 'project', 'featured', 'characters', 'were', 'almost', 'incidental.In', 'order', 'appreciate', 'excitement', 'seeing', 'film', 'must', 'understand', 'X-15', 'had', 'been', 'spoken', '1957', 'when', 'was', '11', 'years', 'old', 'first', 'glimpse', 'X-15', 'was', 'released', 'Air', 'Force', 'photos', 'showed', 'covered', 'large', 'canvas', 'cloaked', 'exact', 'shape', 'rocket', 'only', 'permitted', 'tantalizing', 'first', 'impression', 'shape', 'X-15', 'really', 'helped', 'capture', 'imagination', 'was', 'fan', 'vehicle', 'day', 'forward', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said.The', 'film', 'story', 'was', 'rocket', 'powered', 'extreme', 'altitude', 'aircraft', 'nothing', 'movie', 'actual', 'Air', 'Force', 'footage', 'X-15', 'was', 'worth', 'looking', 'X-15', 'went', 'achieve', 'maximum', 'altitude', 'record', '67', 'miles', 'velocity', 'record', '6.7', 'times', 'speed', 'sound', 'function', 'determined', 'much', 'form', 'X-15', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'rocketplanes', 'ever', 'designed', 'SR-71', 'profile.The', 'X-15', 'demonstrated', 'use', 'reaction', 'attitude', 'control', 'jets', 'application', 'Inconel', 'X', 'high', 'temperature', 'alloy', 'early', 'Air', 'Force', 'pressure', 'suit', 'technology', 'powerful', 'fully', 'throttleable', 'rocket', 'engine', 'did', 'much', 'pioneering', 'research', 'made', 'space', 'shuttle', 'possible', 'later', 'years', 'seldom', 'mentioned', 'X-15', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'research', 'programs', 'U.S.', 'Air', 'Force', 'NASA.According', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'only', 'failed', 'better', 'performance', 'Mach', '8', 'was', 'hoped', 'attempted', 'However', 'did', 'outperform', 'most', 'original', 'specifications', 'also', 'gave', 'many', 'something', 'important', 'be', 'proud', 'early', 'days', 'when', 'America', 'appeared', 'be', 'falling', 'Russians', 'space', 'flight', 'capability']",X-15
789241,A30Q8X8B1S3GGT,B0000YEEWQ,"Mark Savary ""moon_city""","[20, 22]","Half plane, half rocket, the North American X-15 took test pilots to the edge of space for the first time, bridging the gap between air and space flight. This movie showcases the efforts of NASA and the X-15 group to get the experimental rocketplane in the air.Fans of the X-15 will be in heaven, as they are treated to a ton of footage of the X-15 in testing, accidents, and actual flight. But sadly, for the rest of us, the movie is a gigantic bore. The X-15 itself is the star of the movie, the humans being incidental, more or less cardboard cut-outs.The narration of Jimmy Stewart to limited to the opening and closing of the picture, while Mary Tyler Moore and the other officers' wives inexplicably vanish from the last quarter of the picture. Charles Bronson and the other leads are really pretty good, but despite their best efforts, it's really hard to care about them or the success of their plane.The film is strangely lacking in real emotional content. What emotion there is is contrived and has a forced, ""by-the-numbers"" quality. Without any real human drama, it almost feels as if the movie had been put together by a computer.As for the actual X-15 footage, it's hard even to get into that because almost all of the flight scenes are ""stretched"" to fit the widescreen format. As a result, all of the jets are twice as long and half as tall as they ought to look. Frankly, it's distracting, and so maybe the director should have opted for a smaller aspect ratio during filming so that the other footage would better match the X-15 footage.Basically, a toy model of a rocket would soar higher than this picture does... and that's without lighting the engines!",2,Under-powered rocket picture...,1076889600,"02 16, 2004",2004,1674,"['Half', 'plane', 'half', 'rocket', 'North', 'American', 'X-15', 'took', 'test', 'pilots', 'edge', 'space', 'first', 'time', 'bridging', 'gap', 'air', 'space', 'flight', 'movie', 'efforts', 'NASA', 'X-15', 'group', 'get', 'experimental', 'rocketplane', 'air.Fans', 'X-15', 'will', 'be', 'heaven', 'are', 'treated', 'ton', 'footage', 'X-15', 'testing', 'accidents', 'actual', 'flight', 'sadly', 'rest', 'movie', 'gigantic', 'bore', 'X-15', 'star', 'movie', 'humans', 'being', 'incidental', 'more', 'less', 'cardboard', 'cut-outs.The', 'narration', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'limited', 'opening', 'closing', 'picture', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'other', 'officers', 'wives', 'inexplicably', 'vanish', 'last', 'quarter', 'picture', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'other', 'leads', 'are', 'really', 'pretty', 'good', 'best', 'efforts', 'really', 'hard', 'care', 'success', 'plane.The', 'film', 'strangely', 'lacking', 'real', 'emotional', 'content', 'What', 'emotion', 'contrived', 'forced', 'by-the-numbers', 'quality', 'real', 'human', 'drama', 'almost', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'put', 'together', 'computer.As', 'actual', 'X-15', 'footage', 'hard', 'even', 'get', 'almost', 'flight', 'scenes', 'are', 'stretched', 'fit', 'widescreen', 'format', 'result', 'jets', 'are', 'twice', 'long', 'half', 'as', 'tall', 'ought', 'look', 'Frankly', 'distracting', 'so', 'maybe', 'director', 'should', 'have', 'opted', 'smaller', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'filming', 'so', 'other', 'footage', 'would', 'better', 'match', 'X-15', 'footage.Basically', 'toy', 'model', 'rocket', 'would', 'soar', 'higher', 'picture', 'lighting', 'engines']",X-15

But I had seen the movie at the theater when it first came out in 1961 and had kept a found memory of it. I had an urge to see it again. Frankly, it was not as bad as I expected.What people say about the aspect ratio problem is true. Indeed it is disappointing, especially when you consider the fact that with today's technology it would have been relatively easy to make the necessary corrections. That being said, I decided I was going to enjoy it the way it was presented, since there are no alternatives.This production has two main components. One has to do with the main subject itself, the X-15, and I gather would be quite technical for the general public. The other aspect is the typical run-of-the-mill 1960's melodrama, which turns what would have been a dry documentary into a movie. During the entire proceeding we go back and forth between those two polarities. It is actually quite well made in that regard. Keep in mind that we are talking about the early sixties here. Of course we don't make movies like this anymore and some scenes are quite laughable. But yet, it has that charming flavor of what were then very promising times. We now know that they were the golden years of aerospace. Today that atmosphere can only be found at air museums or in movies like this one. Also, back in 1961 was the beginning of space flight and at that time the X-15 program was competing with the Mercury program. This tension is alluded to right from the beginning, and hangs there like a backdrop to the main theme. In this regard it reminded me of Tom Wolf's ""The Right Stuff"", which came out quite a bit later.A nice feature of this DVD is that subtitles are available in English, French or Spanish. If you don't want to miss any word of the technical jargon that they use throughout, you can always switch on the subtitles in the original language.Enjoy!",4,The Good Old Sixties,1243814400,"06 1, 2009",2009,1933,"['reading', 'so', 'many', 'bad', 'reviews', 'was', 'hesitant', 'make', 'purchase', 'had', 'seen', 'movie', 'theater', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', '1961', 'had', 'kept', 'found', 'memory', 'had', 'urge', 'see', 'again', 'Frankly', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'expected.What', 'people', 'say', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'problem', 'true', 'Indeed', 'disappointing', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'fact', 'today', 'technology', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'relatively', 'easy', 'make', 'necessary', 'corrections', 'being', 'said', 'decided', 'was', 'going', 'enjoy', 'way', 'was', 'presented', 'are', 'alternatives.This', 'production', 'two', 'main', 'components', 'One', 'do', 'main', 'subject', 'X-15', 'gather', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'technical', 'general', 'public', 'other', 'aspect', 'typical', 'run-of-the-mill', '1960', 'melodrama', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'dry', 'documentary', 'movie', 'entire', 'proceeding', 'go', 'back', 'forth', 'two', 'polarities', 'actually', 'quite', 'well', 'made', 'regard', 'Keep', 'mind', 'are', 'talking', 'early', 'sixties', 'here', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'movies', 'anymore', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'laughable', 'yet', 'charming', 'flavor', 'what', 'were', 'then', 'very', 'promising', 'times', 'now', 'know', 'were', 'golden', 'years', 'aerospace', 'Today', 'atmosphere', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'found', 'air', 'museums', 'movies', 'one', 'Also', 'back', '1961', 'was', 'beginning', 'space', 'flight', 'time', 'X-15', 'program', 'was', 'competing', 'Mercury', 'program', 'tension', 'alluded', 'right', 'beginning', 'hangs', 'there', 'backdrop', 'main', 'theme', 'regard', 'reminded', 'Tom', 'Wolf', 'Right', 'Stuff', 'came', 'out', 'quite', 'bit', 'later.A', 'nice', 'feature', 'DVD', 'subtitles', 'are', 'available', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'word', 'technical', 'jargon', 'use', 'can', 'always', 'switch', 'subtitles', 'original', 'language.Enjoy']",X-15

Hence the annoying distorsion that makes all aircraft look like some giant inadvertenly stamped his foot on them.
