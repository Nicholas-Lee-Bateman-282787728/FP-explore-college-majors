955533,A3T2V257AME9SP,B000C6NPHC,A.B.,"[3, 4]","It has been quite sometime since I've seen reruns of this show (almost ten years). I was getting disappointed when I watched the first 4 episodes of this show (very weak plots, characters, almost too unrealistic). Then the true niche came for what Growing Pains is known for, great writing, cast members who are believable and situations that are part of real life.The first season is great (except for the first couple of episodes), unlike many shows where you have to have 3 seasons before the characters and the plots begin to get good. Episodes on these disks are hillarious with special guest stars such as Annette Funicello (Mickey Mouse Club) who plays the Mrs. Cleaver type (Leave it to Beaver), but with a little b***hiness on the side. And the funny thing is, it's Annette who's playing this nasty woman.The relationship between Mike and Carol are very realistic, almost like the relationship I had with my sister. (I love the part where Carol is giving Mike a hard time while teaching him to dance, and to get even, Mike throws her into the door to make her fall. Great STUFF.The cast is very well put together and the story plotlines are hillarious. If you love 80's television, Growing Pains, family shows, you'll love growing pains.",5,Great Show after all these LONG years.,1140566400,"02 22, 2006",2006,1246,"['been', 'quite', 'sometime', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'reruns', 'show', 'almost', 'ten', 'years', 'was', 'getting', 'disappointed', 'when', 'watched', 'first', '4', 'episodes', 'show', 'very', 'weak', 'plots', 'characters', 'almost', 'too', 'unrealistic', 'Then', 'true', 'niche', 'came', 'what', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'known', 'great', 'writing', 'cast', 'members', 'who', 'are', 'believable', 'situations', 'are', 'part', 'real', 'life.The', 'first', 'season', 'great', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'many', 'shows', 'where', 'have', 'have', '3', 'seasons', 'characters', 'plots', 'begin', 'get', 'good', 'Episodes', 'disks', 'are', 'hillarious', 'special', 'guest', 'stars', 'such', 'Annette', 'Funicello', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Club', 'who', 'Mrs.', 'Cleaver', 'type', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'little', 'b***hiness', 'side', 'funny', 'thing', 'Annette', 'who', 'playing', 'nasty', 'woman.The', 'relationship', 'Mike', 'Carol', 'are', 'very', 'realistic', 'almost', 'relationship', 'had', 'sister', 'love', 'part', 'where', 'Carol', 'giving', 'Mike', 'hard', 'time', 'teaching', 'dance', 'get', 'even', 'Mike', 'door', 'make', 'fall', 'Great', 'STUFF.The', 'cast', 'very', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'story', 'plotlines', 'are', 'hillarious', 'love', '80', 'television', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'family', 'shows', ""'ll"", 'love', 'growing', 'pains']",Growing Pains: Season 1

We're still talking PG rating here but what a shock seeing Dr Seaver trying to bed down Maggie at every other twist and turn of the story. The pendulum has certainly moved in the other direction!

955536,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B000C6NPHC,andy8047,"[6, 8]","This sitcom,which premiered on ABC in September 1985,made a star and teen idol out of 15-year-old Kirk Cameron who played Mike Seaver,one of the sons of Jason(Alan Thicke) and Maggie Seaver(Joanna Kerns). Three's A Crowd,the not-too-popular spinoff of Three's Company got the Nielsen axe,so fans of ABC sitcoms got something new to watch,this one. Also,Diff'rent Strokes moved from NBC to ABC for its eighth and final season. That's another treat for the ABC sitcom fans. Rounding out the Growing Pains cast are Tracey Gold as daughter Carol and Jeremy Miller as Carol's and Mike's brother Ben. Gold gained national attention throughout the seven-year-run of the series as well as Cameron. Gold's longtime battle with anorexia made news in publications such as Star,The Enquirer and The Globe. Cameron did a few films since GP premiered,one of them being LIKE FATHER LIKE SON with the late Dudley Moore. Thicke is also a songwriter. He wrote or co-wrote a few theme songs for other television shows. He was once married to singer-actress Gloria Loring. Kerns previously worked for ABC,having guest-starred on two episodes of Three's Company. Post-GP,she's made a handful of telefilms,or TV movies. Cameron is currently married to actress Chelsea Noble. Later on GP,Noble had a recurring role as Mike's girlfriend. The couple wed in 1991,when GP was still on ABC. Even Leonardo DiCaprio had a recurring role later in the series. DiCaprio's notoriety led to a movie career which continues today. DiCaprio was a teen idol from the late 1990's to the early 2000's.",4,Another family sitcom,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,1560,"['sitcom', 'premiered', 'ABC', 'September', '1985', 'made', 'star', 'teen', 'idol', '15-year-old', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'who', 'played', 'Mike', 'Seaver', 'one', 'sons', 'Jason', 'Alan', 'Thicke', 'Maggie', 'Seaver', 'Joanna', 'Kerns', 'Three', 'A', 'Crowd', 'not-too-popular', 'spinoff', 'Three', 'Company', 'got', 'Nielsen', 'axe', 'so', 'fans', 'ABC', 'sitcoms', 'got', 'something', 'new', 'watch', 'one', 'Also', ""Diff'rent"", 'Strokes', 'moved', 'NBC', 'ABC', 'eighth', 'final', 'season', 'treat', 'ABC', 'sitcom', 'fans', 'Rounding', 'out', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'cast', 'are', 'Tracey', 'Gold', 'daughter', 'Carol', 'Jeremy', 'Miller', 'Carol', 'Mike', 'brother', 'Ben', 'Gold', 'gained', 'national', 'attention', 'seven-year-run', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'Cameron', 'Gold', 'longtime', 'battle', 'anorexia', 'made', 'news', 'publications', 'such', 'Star', 'Enquirer', 'Globe', 'Cameron', 'did', 'few', 'films', 'GP', 'premiered', 'one', 'being', 'FATHER', 'LIKE', 'SON', 'late', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'Thicke', 'also', 'songwriter', 'wrote', 'co-wrote', 'few', 'theme', 'songs', 'other', 'television', 'shows', 'was', 'once', 'married', 'singer-actress', 'Gloria', 'Loring', 'Kerns', 'previously', 'worked', 'ABC', 'having', 'guest-starred', 'two', 'episodes', 'Three', 'Company', 'Post-GP', 'made', 'handful', 'telefilms', 'TV', 'movies', 'Cameron', 'currently', 'married', 'actress', 'Chelsea', 'Noble', 'Later', 'GP', 'Noble', 'had', 'recurring', 'role', 'Mike', 'girlfriend', 'couple', 'wed', '1991', 'when', 'GP', 'was', 'still', 'ABC', 'Even', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'had', 'recurring', 'role', 'later', 'series', 'DiCaprio', 'notoriety', 'led', 'movie', 'career', 'today', 'DiCaprio', 'was', 'teen', 'idol', 'late', '1990', 'early', '2000']",Growing Pains: Season 1

These 22 Season One episodes are the original uncut ABC versions, but that is only part of the good news here.  The studio also paid extra to license the original music used in the episodes, and for this set that must have been a pretty penny.  In addition to original songs of the 1985 era including Howard Jones' ""Things Can Only Get Better"", Scritti Politti's ""Perfect Way"", and Dire Strait's ""Money For Nothing"" (among other songs), there were also instances of Jeremy Miller belting out his rendition of some Elvis classics including ""Hound Dog"" and Alan Thicke's take on Steppenwolf's ""Born to Be Wild"".  Even with all the extra money Warner had to pay to retain all of this music, they kept the price point for this set VERY reasonable.  Warner Bros. has a great history of not going cheap when it comes to treatment of their television properties on DVD, and I have nothing but respect for them for that.As far as extras, this set is not bare-bones by any means.  In addition to including scenes from the original pilot with a different actress playing the part of Carol, there is also a very good reunion special of the five first season cast members sitting around a campfire sharing their memories of working on the show and the stories behind how they were cast.  This type of thing is always fascinating and enjoyable, and this one is no exception.However, I'm extremely disappointed that two years have passed since this set was released with no sign of the second season to be found.  I think this set did not sell as well as it should have, and that has put the DVD treatment for the remainder of the series in jeopardy.  As much as we all hate to admit it, the studios who publish these sets DO have to approach the process from a business standpoint.  For the money they laid out on this spectacular set, it has not been financially successful for Warner Bros.  However, the bright side here is that this set is still in print and still selling copies, so the day may come when enough copies have sold to give Warner faith to invest in the second season.  In the meantime, we'll just have to keep hoping and waiting.If you don't have this set yet, do yourself a favor and pick it up.  These shows are GREAT, and will be good viewing by both ""children of the 80's"" (like me) and kids today.

Out of all of these my favorite character was Carol Seaver. I always thought her character was smart, witty, and cute. I haven't had a chance to buy this yet, but I will.

The series also made it's teen lead, Kirk Cameron an instant teen idol.The first season of Growing Pains was released on DVD February 7th. The DVD box set includes all 22 episodes from the shows first season. It's great seeing the episodes again. You may recall that during the shows first season, the show opener included short scenes in which Alan Thick as Dr. Seaver and Joanna Kerns as Maggie Seaver announce the premise of the show. He is a psychiatrist who moves his practice home to be close to the kids and she has returned to her job as a journalist. Dr. Seaver and Maggie have three kids. Mike (Kirk Cameron) the wise cracking oldest son, Carol (Tracy Gold)the brainy middle child, and Ben (Jeremy Miller) the curious youngest child. The show was about the family balancing their careers and the kids dealing with the growing pains of adolescence.The season one episodes are a great foundation for the show. In the pilot Mike gets chastised for joyriding and Carol returns back to work. In a neat twist, you can watch an alternative version of the shows pilot. The DVD box set includes the shows original pilot which features actress Elizabeth Ward in the role of Carol season.In the first season episodes, The Seavers deal with a gambit of social and family issues. Dr. Seaver has to deal with jealousy issues when Carol becomes entrenched in a project that requires her to spend late work nights with her co-worker. Carol also has to deal with esteem issues as a she hears a classmate has made a negative comment about her appearance. She also strives to be a writer like her mother and doesn't quite know how to deal with the constructive criticism her mother provides to her. Mike is embarrassed when his classmates discover that he went to the Bruce Springsteen concert with his dad. Ben, the youngest son didn't have many episodes where he was the focus of the storyline during the first season but his presence was important and several storylines involved him.One of the best things about the DVD box set is the bonus feature ""S'Mores and More."" This is a cast reunion and all of the season 1 cast members appear in a brand new roundtable discussion in front of a camp fire. Every one in the cast looks awesome. They are joined by one of the shows writers. It's a rather long discussion in which the cast members discuss their auditions, their off screen relationships, the show and much more.

So at the time most of its humor drifted over my head while the more direct shows like ALF captivated me.  But in recent years I rediscovered Growing Pains (all seven seasons through various sources), and I understand what older kids and young teens (and indeed the whole family) loved about it.  Some people accuse GP of being a cheesy pop culture icon of the '80s, but it really did have a witty edge to it that you don't get much of today, save on a few of the brassier late-night shows.The first season is definitely NOT the best.  There are plenty of giggles here, from Mike's fling with a Madonna wannabe to Jason's jealousy when Maggie gets involved in a news project with a young male co-worker.  And who can forget the day that Mike plans to cheat on a test but ends up not needing to after all (but alas the dishonesty damage is already done)?  I think that it's in the second and third (and fourth and fifth) seasons that we get a clearer picture of all the Seavers and their friends (not to mention Mike's best friend Boner, who plays a rather boring and trivial role in the first year).  But let's hope that the subsequent seasons are released on DVD, and done soon.The stories of Growing Pains are of the kind that most families across all social spectra can relate to in one way or another.  There's a little here for everyone.  In contrast to the rather bubble-gum conservatism of many 80s sitcoms, there is plenty of light-hearted sexual innuendo here as well as discussion of serious issues, like drug use, terminal illness and even crony capitalism!  And who can ever forget the hilarious double entendre implied by the nickname Boner, which the characters never refer to in a naughty context?This show makes me wish I was born just three or four years earlier so I would have been old enough to share the laughter and love at the time.  The Seavers are the kind of family that most Americans (and other people around the world) would look up to as an idol.  In that sense, Growing Pains represents a kind of social utopia that most of us can believe in, an ideal that contemporary America has, unfortunately, fallen all too far short of.  Perhaps some day every family will have a fair opportunity of having things end up as well as this family did.My first experience with Growing Pains came too early and didn't go beyond a few episodes.  The second one came in early adulthood, kind of late but still plenty young to show me its smiles.",4,I can FINALLY appreciate this classic,1206748800,"03 29, 2008",2008,2540,"['Honestly', 'when', 'sitcom', 'came', 'air', '1985', 'was', 'only', 'three', 'years', 'old', 'So', 'time', 'most', 'humor', 'drifted', 'head', 'more', 'direct', 'shows', 'ALF', 'captivated', 'recent', 'years', 'rediscovered', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'seven', 'seasons', 'various', 'sources', 'understand', 'what', 'older', 'kids', 'young', 'teens', 'indeed', 'whole', 'family', 'loved', 'people', 'accuse', 'GP', 'being', 'cheesy', 'pop', 'culture', 'icon', ""'80s"", 'really', 'did', 'have', 'witty', 'edge', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'today', 'save', 'few', 'brassier', 'late-night', 'shows.The', 'first', 'season', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'best', 'are', 'plenty', 'giggles', 'here', 'Mike', 'fling', 'Madonna', 'wannabe', 'Jason', 'jealousy', 'when', 'Maggie', 'involved', 'news', 'project', 'young', 'male', 'co-worker', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'day', 'Mike', 'cheat', 'test', 'up', 'not', 'needing', 'dishonesty', 'damage', 'already', 'done', 'think', 'second', 'third', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'seasons', 'get', 'clearer', 'picture', 'Seavers', 'friends', 'not', 'mention', 'Mike', 'best', 'friend', 'Boner', 'who', 'rather', 'boring', 'trivial', 'role', 'first', 'year', 'let', 'hope', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'are', 'released', 'DVD', 'done', 'soon.The', 'stories', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'are', 'kind', 'most', 'families', 'social', 'spectra', 'can', 'relate', 'one', 'way', 'little', 'here', 'everyone', 'contrast', 'rather', 'bubble-gum', 'conservatism', 'many', '80s', 'sitcoms', 'plenty', 'light-hearted', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'discussion', 'serious', 'issues', 'drug', 'use', 'terminal', 'illness', 'even', 'crony', 'capitalism', 'who', 'can', 'ever', 'forget', 'hilarious', 'double', 'entendre', 'implied', 'nickname', 'Boner', 'characters', 'never', 'refer', 'naughty', 'context', 'show', 'wish', 'was', 'born', 'just', 'three', 'four', 'years', 'earlier', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'old', 'enough', 'share', 'laughter', 'love', 'time', 'Seavers', 'are', 'kind', 'family', 'most', 'Americans', 'other', 'people', 'world', 'would', 'look', 'up', 'idol', 'sense', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'kind', 'social', 'utopia', 'most', 'can', 'believe', 'ideal', 'contemporary', 'America', 'unfortunately', 'fallen', 'too', 'far', 'short', 'Perhaps', 'day', 'family', 'will', 'have', 'fair', 'opportunity', 'having', 'things', 'end', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'family', 'first', 'experience', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'came', 'too', 'early', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'few', 'episodes', 'second', 'one', 'came', 'early', 'adulthood', 'kind', 'late', 'still', 'plenty', 'young', 'show', 'smiles']",Growing Pains: Season 1

955564,A228JH8V9Y700G,B000C6NPHC,MortensOrchid,"[7, 13]","Watching a beloved old show all these years later makes me see how much things have changed in terms of TV entertainment.  Before it was family based sit coms and nighttime soaps in those days, to more adult humor oriented sit coms (ex. Friends), to reality TV shows.  This was the show that launched the second love of my life, Kirk Cameron, onto every teenage girl's bedroom walls and rescued Alan Thicke from career death.  Here we beheld a more ""liberal"" family, where the mother Maggie (played by Joanna Kerns) works outside of the home while her husband Jason operates his psychiatry practice out of their home and is the ""house husband"".  They have their three children : adorable little Ben, studious Carol, and the rascal Mike.  Their antics and putting all these people under the same roof made for some great sitcom plot and adventure.  Most of the time the problem was resolved at the end of the show with a big hug and a lesson learned, the recipe for a family sitcom.There are some dark shadows that linger over this otherwise heartwarming  show.  Tracey Gold was nerded up quite a bit to play Carol and sait it bothered her quite a bit, as Carol was a contrast to her own dyslexia and poor grades.  The later cracks about her weight would later lead to her anorexia and nearly cost her her life.  Jeremy Miller was always on the strait and narrow, but it was clear once this show had run its course that it would not go further.  And Kirk Cameron.  It's so odd to know that the boy I looked at with goo goo eyes on my walls was such a troublemaker.  He found Jesus as a teenager, distanced himself from the cast and crew, began throwing around his weight as he opposed the ""immorality"" of scripts, and even had the three original creators quit at the peak of their success by calling the president of the network at home and telling him they were pornographers.  And he walked away from all the fame and glory of teen idolhood, his demands would hurt the quality of the show, and he would dedicate his life to Christian causes and work.Now, I am not opposed to people who want to help their fellow man or connect to their spirituality.  But, I am opposed to someone like Kirk who inflicted his religious beliefs to such a zealous extreme that he refused to compromise.  These people are hypocrits.  Maybe he did realize that the fame was shallow and he wanted something more, but he bit the hand that fed him.  Notice he doesn't appear on the commentaries, because he chooses not to speak with any of them now.  Now, he's kind of a joke to some.  And how ironic that the reason people will listen to him at all these years later because he used to be on some TV show.Still, this box set makes me think back to a simpler time.  Not just my own childhood, but to when TV entertainment was relatively clean and somewhat more innocent than it is now.  It also makes me feel, dare I say it, OLD.",3,Where is that smile again?

I remember when Kirk Cameron was practically every young girl's crush (yes I liked him when I was only 10).  This show was very popular, so I could never understand why none of the remaining seasons were being released.  Lack of interest, poor advertising maybe.  There were so many fans, I really thought more people would buy this.  It is a classic 80s sitcom and suitable for family viewing.  The kind of show they don't make anymore.  Even when it's corny, it's entertaining.  The picture and sound quality of the dvd is very good, though I noticed some fast-motion or distortion in one scene of the Christmas episode.  Maybe I got a defective disc, or it's the way the film looks, but other than that it's fine.  My favorite episode is the one when Mike gets hurt on the dirt bike.  Soooo funny.  I enjoyed the cast reunion clip that was included, as well as the gag reel.While the first season is good, IMO it was the second and third seasons when this show was at it's best.  The characters really became the ones we all know and love, and there were better storylines.  I also like how Mike became goofier at times.  I just saw that season 2 is available for pre-order, so I ordered mine.  At last!  It has been so long since the first season came out, I honestly started to wonder if nobody would take a chance on more seasons.  Maybe because of the passing of Andrew Koenig (Boner), someone decided to take another look at this great show.I have most of season 2 on vhs tape, and I watch those episodes more than the first season dvd.  I'm hoping they will include more bonus footage on the next season.  But I'll be happy just to have the episodes.  Even if they only release the third and quit, I'll be happy because those are my favorites.

I was the same age as Mike Seaver, so I related to him in a few ways, most particularly the episode where he falls for a Madonna-wannabe. What teenage guy in the 80s hasn't fallen for a girl like that?This show is a like a time capsule to the 80s, with Mike Seaver going to a Bruce Springsteen concert with his dad and getting embarrassed when his dad overacts for the local news cameras. His predicaments are real and relatable, and while I can't watch sitcoms now, I grew up with ""Growing Pains"". The Seavers were like the family next door, people you wanted to know and hang out with. I'm not sure I'd buy this on DVD though. It's been over a decade since I've watched any episodes, though I remember being fond of the earlier seasons (before they have child #4 and she grows faster than humanly possible). I look forward to renting this and seeing if it remains watchable or just cheesy nostalgia. I'm glad that they are putting this show out on DVD. Considering how many bad TV shows made it to DVD, they are finally getting around to my favorites (like ""Moonlighting""--my favorite show of all time).One thing I most like about ""Growing Pains"" is the theme song.

955567,A2LNEZD3YBO12O,B000C6NPHC,Preston,"[4, 6]","It was about time that Growing Pains was released on DVD after years on ABC Family.  It was one of the best family shows, but avoiding the silliness of Brady Bunch.  Much of the focus was on Kirk Cameron, but they later shifted to the Seavers and the other kids.  I think that the show where Kirk went with his dad to the Bruce Springsteen concert obviously was written during Bruce's massive success in mid 1985 with a multi platinum year-old hit album. It showed that you can share the music with your kids without the generation gap that one would think. I think that Kirk has really matured into a successful actor in movies and has continued that into ministry with his show on the TBN network. I think that the moral values that were shown on Growing Pains are what he still feels today. Alan Thicke I knew from this show, but I didn't know that he did theme songs for '70s game shows, and they did sound good when I recently heard them.  He became a better TV dad as the series went on.  And while I am really distraught about her recent drunk driving arrest last year, it doesn't keep me from accepting how wonderful Tracy Gold was on this show. And I remember one Leonardo Dicaprio on this show long before he moved on to the massively successful Titanic and more meaty, serious dramatic movie roles. He was actually that good on GP's 7th season. This show dealt with many topics on the Seaver family's willingness to survive through life's many challenges, but in a funny way. The first season's shows showed that they were a work in progress, but the show got better between 1988 and 1990. And Annette Funicello's cattiness on that one show sort of changed the family dynamics and their former niceness. She just didn't like Carol's career move, but Carol fought back. This was a unique kind of show where not all the problems were solved at the very end. Which really applies to life sometimes.

It also makes me realize things I didn't recognize on the first go round.I had absolutely forgotten the little vignette before each episode that told you the premise of the show: Jason Seaver, a psychiatrist, is going to be working out of the home and raising the three children because his wife, Maggie, is going back to work as a journalist.Of course, the break out star of the show is Kirk Cameron as Mike Seaver, the eldest of the three children.  Do TV teen idols in today's world get as big as he was?The show is fairly typical sitcom fair.  There are jokes, sibling rivalry, a problem, and finally, a solution with a moral lesson.  Or should I say typical for the 80's; the days of a sitcom ending with a parent going over what the kid has learned has gone the way of the Cosby Show.The packagaing is attractive and the extras are nice.  The unaired pilot with a different actress playing Tracey Gold's ""Carol"" is interesting and the gag reel is cute.  The real treat is the cast sitting around a camp fire reminiscing.  It's nearly 30 minutes long and I always enjoy seeing how the stars of yesterday look today.  But more than that, it's obvious that they all really enjoy each other's company and are fond of the time they had on the show.

955569,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B000C6NPHC,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[2, 4]","Before televangelism, Kirk Cameron already got worshiped by millions of pre-teen and teenage girls. This series was produced by Miller-Boyett productions, the same company responsible for a string of family-friendly shows in the 1980's and early 1990's.Personally in love with Michael J. Fox during the 1980's, I still watched Growing Pains---and found some interesting things throughout this first season.Maggie Seaver (Joanna Kerns) works outside the home as a newscaster, and husband Jason (Alan Thicke) is a psychiatrist who re-established his practice inside a wing of their gargantuan family house. This new workplace arrangement gives Jason both the professional credentials and personal time to catch and talk with his own kids whenever they are not doing something which they should. In keeping with the times and the `wholesome' tone of this show, nothing `bad' really happens to the Seaver kids during many misadventures, but they still need lots of guidance enroute to adulthood.Mike (Kirk Cameron) is the eldest child---and a perpetual `goof-off'---much to the dismay of his parents. He constantly gets in schemes with best friend Bonner (Andrew Koening) to the amusement of `genius' sister Carol (Tracey Gold). Both Mike and Carol deal with younger brother Ben (Jeremy Miller), constantly underfoot this 1985-1986 season. Twenty two episodes are included in this DVD release.My favorite episode from this season is ""Superdad"". It continued exploring after effects of the Seaver's new work-living arrangements.  As opposed to only talking about a `workplace switch' in the first episode and then dumping reference, `Growing Pains' writers had enough sense to carry the storyline over into subsequent episodes. Maggie becomes concerned Jason now monopolizes the children and she (who was formerly the stay-at-home parent) sees them less often. Olivia D'Abo (who went on to star in the Wonder Years as `hippie sister Karen Arnold') guest stars as Wendy.I'm also partial to ""Standardized Test"" because it deftly illustrates how arbitrary these `scientific measurements' really are, and the many consequences of gauging academic progress through testing alone. After doodling on an IQ test, Mike ends up getting an IQ score of 28 and subsequently is tracked into programs to `help' him. Mike's hardly a genius, but the received score is absurdly low for his actual academic capabilities. Initially taking the test results verbatim, the school overlooked what Mike's class work really said about his academic capabilities. In today's test-driven education system, this episode remains especially poignant. Test results cannot and will not tell us everything about student capabilities.Finally, ""A Christmas Story"" is another solid offering. A depressed department store Santa who Jason is counseling decides to commit suicide by jumping down the Seaver's chimney. This is one of the more serious episodes, and it was a radical scripting decision for a show which normally lacked anything `too wild'. This episode also provided an interesting alternative to all of the bland `holiday' episodes networks continue trotting out for sitcomsBecause the Growing Pains merchandising empire primarily had focused on Kirk Cameron, quality storylines and scripts involving other family members and guest characters were pivotal for show longevity.  Plenty of the standard `teen tries to get a date' and `teen wants to party' plots are interspersed all throughout this season, but the writers wisely had a large variety of scripts.  I feel their planning ultimately added critical depth to the show. It made Growing Pains much more than Kirk running around and looking (admittedly) `good' in some (admittedly) over the top 80's fashions.Extras for this release include the obligatory gag reel and a feature ""Seaver Family Reunion: S'mores and More""-the cast reminisces about having worked together on this series. The most interesting extra is obviously the formerly unaired pilot precisely because I grew up with Tracey Gold playing `Carol Seaver'",5,Don't waste another minute of your crying...Season One's on DVD,1139270400,"02 7, 2006",2006,4044,"['televangelism', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'already', 'got', 'worshiped', 'millions', 'pre-teen', 'teenage', 'girls', 'series', 'was', 'produced', 'Miller-Boyett', 'productions', 'same', 'company', 'responsible', 'string', 'family-friendly', 'shows', '1980', 'early', ""1990's.Personally"", 'love', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', '1980', 'still', 'watched', 'Growing', 'Pains', '-and', 'found', 'interesting', 'things', 'first', 'season.Maggie', 'Seaver', 'Joanna', 'Kerns', 'home', 'newscaster', 'husband', 'Jason', 'Alan', 'Thicke', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 're-established', 'practice', 'wing', 'gargantuan', 'family', 'house', 'new', 'workplace', 'arrangement', 'Jason', 'professional', 'credentials', 'personal', 'time', 'catch', 'talk', 'own', 'kids', 'are', 'not', 'doing', 'something', 'should', 'keeping', 'times', 'wholesome', 'tone', 'show', 'nothing', 'bad', 'really', 'Seaver', 'kids', 'many', 'misadventures', 'still', 'need', 'lots', 'guidance', 'enroute', 'adulthood.Mike', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'eldest', 'child', '-and', 'perpetual', 'goof-off', '-much', 'dismay', 'parents', 'constantly', 'schemes', 'best', 'friend', 'Bonner', 'Andrew', 'Koening', 'amusement', 'genius', 'sister', 'Carol', 'Tracey', 'Gold', 'Mike', 'Carol', 'deal', 'younger', 'brother', 'Ben', 'Jeremy', 'Miller', 'constantly', 'underfoot', '1985-1986', 'season', 'Twenty', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'included', 'DVD', 'favorite', 'episode', 'season', 'Superdad', 'continued', 'exploring', 'effects', 'Seaver', 'new', 'work-living', 'arrangements', 'opposed', 'only', 'talking', 'workplace', 'switch', 'first', 'episode', 'then', 'dumping', 'reference', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'writers', 'had', 'enough', 'sense', 'carry', 'storyline', 'subsequent', 'episodes', 'Maggie', 'concerned', 'Jason', 'now', 'children', 'who', 'was', 'formerly', 'stay-at-home', 'parent', 'less', 'often', 'Olivia', ""D'Abo"", 'who', 'went', 'star', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'hippie', 'sister', 'Karen', 'Arnold', 'guest', 'stars', 'Wendy.I', ""'m"", 'also', 'partial', 'Standardized', 'Test', 'deftly', 'how', 'arbitrary', 'scientific', 'measurements', 'really', 'are', 'many', 'consequences', 'gauging', 'academic', 'progress', 'testing', 'alone', 'doodling', 'IQ', 'test', 'Mike', 'up', 'getting', 'IQ', 'score', '28', 'subsequently', 'tracked', 'programs', 'help', 'Mike', 'hardly', 'genius', 'received', 'score', 'absurdly', 'low', 'actual', 'academic', 'capabilities', 'Initially', 'taking', 'test', 'results', 'verbatim', 'school', 'overlooked', 'what', 'Mike', 'class', 'work', 'really', 'said', 'academic', 'capabilities', 'today', 'test-driven', 'education', 'system', 'episode', 'especially', 'poignant', 'Test', 'results', 'can', 'not', 'will', 'not', 'tell', 'everything', 'student', 'capabilities.Finally', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'solid', 'offering', 'depressed', 'department', 'store', 'Santa', 'who', 'Jason', 'counseling', 'decides', 'commit', 'suicide', 'jumping', 'down', 'Seaver', 'chimney', 'one', 'more', 'serious', 'episodes', 'was', 'radical', 'scripting', 'decision', 'show', 'normally', 'lacked', 'anything', 'too', 'wild', 'episode', 'also', 'provided', 'interesting', 'alternative', 'bland', 'holiday', 'episodes', 'networks', 'continue', 'trotting', 'out', 'sitcomsBecause', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'merchandising', 'empire', 'primarily', 'had', 'focused', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'quality', 'storylines', 'scripts', 'involving', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'guest', 'characters', 'were', 'pivotal', 'show', 'longevity', 'Plenty', 'standard', 'teen', 'tries', 'get', 'date', 'teen', 'party', 'plots', 'are', 'interspersed', 'season', 'writers', 'wisely', 'had', 'large', 'variety', 'scripts', 'feel', 'planning', 'ultimately', 'added', 'critical', 'depth', 'show', 'made', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'much', 'more', 'Kirk', 'running', 'around', 'looking', 'admittedly', 'good', 'admittedly', 'top', '80', 'fashions.Extras', 'release', 'include', 'obligatory', 'gag', 'reel', 'feature', 'Seaver', 'Family', 'Reunion', ""S'mores"", 'More', '-the', 'cast', 'reminisces', 'having', 'worked', 'together', 'series', 'most', 'interesting', 'extra', 'obviously', 'formerly', 'unaired', 'pilot', 'precisely', 'grew', 'up', 'Tracey', 'Gold', 'playing', 'Carol', 'Seaver']",Growing Pains: Season 1

When the dye washes off this beautiful girl loves him for the deception as she suddenly discovers that neither she nor her family never really liked the lost dog. No interest at all in the fate of the poor lost dog. Its all about what makes them feel real good, right now.
