I watched this documentary a couple of times.  The first time I got the whole story, but as I watched it more and more, I got more angry.  The filmmaker does a great job of staying impartial in the light of the facts but one thing truly comes through.  It is an entire movie about a woman who committed an unspeakable, heinous act against her own children and three other innocent people, but yet almost everyone in the movie paints her as a saint.  She was a wonderful employee, mother, wife, etc.  She's almost referred to in reverential terms.  It gets irritating after a while, when you consider what Diane Schuler actually did.The person that made the most angry was her husband, Danny.  He sees everyone around him suffering and he continues to say &#34;my wife didn't do this, my wife didn't do this.&#34;  He claims autopsies and toxicology reports were done incorrectly and that something medical must have happened to her.  What would the New York State authorities have to gain from falsifying Diane Schuler's autopsy and toxicology report?  Why would they frame her?  Danny's behavior is the most bizarre out of all the people in the movie.The movie is well made and opens up the world of families in grief and how they continue to cope with it.",5,"Excellent Documentary, Tragic Story",1402617600,"06 13, 2014",2014,1365,"['remember', 'story', 'news', 'grew', 'up', 'suburbs', 'New', 'York', 'know', 'Taconic', 'very', 'well', 'watched', 'documentary', 'couple', 'times', 'first', 'time', 'got', 'whole', 'story', 'watched', 'more', 'more', 'got', 'more', 'angry', 'filmmaker', 'great', 'job', 'staying', 'impartial', 'light', 'facts', 'one', 'thing', 'truly', 'entire', 'movie', 'woman', 'who', 'committed', 'unspeakable', 'heinous', 'act', 'own', 'children', 'three', 'other', 'innocent', 'people', 'yet', 'almost', 'everyone', 'movie', 'saint', 'was', 'wonderful', 'employee', 'mother', 'wife', 'etc', 'almost', 'referred', 'reverential', 'terms', 'irritating', 'while', 'when', 'consider', 'what', 'Diane', 'Schuler', 'actually', 'person', 'made', 'most', 'angry', 'was', 'husband', 'Danny', 'everyone', 'suffering', 'say', '34', 'wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'this.', '34', 'autopsies', 'toxicology', 'reports', 'were', 'done', 'incorrectly', 'something', 'medical', 'must', 'have', 'happened', 'What', 'would', 'New', 'York', 'State', 'authorities', 'have', 'gain', 'falsifying', 'Diane', 'Schuler', 'autopsy', 'toxicology', 'report', 'Why', 'would', 'frame', 'Danny', 'behavior', 'most', 'bizarre', 'people', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'well', 'made', 'up', 'world', 'families', 'grief', 'how', 'continue', 'cope']",There's Something Wrong With Aunt Diane

1508805,A1DB4U8ISVULVE,B0062RY3Z8,Bill Smith,"[6, 11]","This HBO special is ultimately frustrating because it really provides no answers. It lays out the facts chronologically well enough, but fails to do some further deeper investigative work that should have been done. It also fails to explore the only explanation that makes sense to me---this woman committed suicide, taking her own kids and her brother's kids with her to her death. For whatever reasons that we still don't know (but I suspect her husband knows), this woman was depressed, self medicated, and ultimately snapped. She intentionally combined pot smoking with drinking virtually an entire bottle of vodka while driving young children back home. She got on the freeway driving the wrong way for 1.7 miles intentionally colliding into an oncoming vehicle. Witnesses said she was traveling 70 mph and driving straight as an arrow when driving that last 1.7 miles, which sounds intentional to me. These are the actions of someone trying to kill herself. Yet the documentary seems to go out of its way to show her supposedly perfect ideal life with little to no problems. Who knows why she snapped, maybe it was because she could no longer bear the stress and strain of being the ""perfect mother"" and from what it sounds like, the main breadwinner, and it finally all caught up with her. She apparantly had been drinking and pot smoking for some time to ""relieve stress"", contrary to the denials of her husband etc.The producers of the special should have done a better job at confronting the investigator that was hired as to why he seemed to drop the ball on following up, that part was fuzzy.Then, to top it off, they have this forensic psychiatrist completely speculate at the end that he doesn't think she did this intentionally, after spending the whole documentary before that explaining the reasons why she could have been seriously emotionally scarred and vulnerable to over-selfmedication due to her mother abandoning her at age 9 and the stress and scarring from being thrust into the role of family caretaker at a young age, and her attempts to be so ""in control"" and the perfect mother that her own mother was not.Ultimately, there may be no definitive answer, but it appears from all the facts and evidence that this totally ""in control"" woman was depressed, stressed (notice how overweight she was, a sign of overeating and addictive behavior), overwhelmed, and maybe after a week of vacation couldn't bear to go back to reality and everyday life being ""super mom"" and lost control and snapped, possibly in a fit of ultimate rage against her own mother for the abandonment, and innocent children and others on the road that day paid the price.",2,"This woman intentionally committed suicide, and murder",1370131200,"06 2, 2013",2013,2667,"['HBO', 'special', 'ultimately', 'frustrating', 'really', 'answers', 'out', 'facts', 'chronologically', 'well', 'enough', 'do', 'further', 'deeper', 'investigative', 'work', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'also', 'explore', 'only', 'explanation', 'sense', '-this', 'woman', 'committed', 'suicide', 'taking', 'own', 'kids', 'brother', 'kids', 'death', 'reasons', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'suspect', 'husband', 'knows', 'woman', 'was', 'depressed', 'medicated', 'ultimately', 'snapped', 'intentionally', 'combined', 'pot', 'smoking', 'drinking', 'virtually', 'entire', 'bottle', 'vodka', 'driving', 'young', 'children', 'back', 'home', 'got', 'freeway', 'driving', 'wrong', 'way', '1.7', 'miles', 'intentionally', 'colliding', 'oncoming', 'vehicle', 'Witnesses', 'said', 'was', 'traveling', '70', 'mph', 'driving', 'straight', 'arrow', 'when', 'driving', 'last', '1.7', 'miles', 'intentional', 'are', 'actions', 'someone', 'trying', 'kill', 'documentary', 'go', 'out', 'way', 'show', 'supposedly', 'perfect', 'ideal', 'life', 'little', 'problems', 'Who', 'why', 'snapped', 'maybe', 'was', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'bear', 'stress', 'strain', 'being', 'perfect', 'mother', 'what', 'main', 'breadwinner', 'finally', 'caught', 'up', 'apparantly', 'had', 'been', 'drinking', 'pot', 'smoking', 'time', 'relieve', 'stress', 'contrary', 'denials', 'husband', 'etc.The', 'producers', 'special', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'confronting', 'investigator', 'was', 'hired', 'why', 'seemed', 'drop', 'ball', 'following', 'up', 'part', 'was', 'fuzzy.Then', 'top', 'off', 'have', 'forensic', 'psychiatrist', 'completely', 'speculate', 'end', ""n't"", 'think', 'did', 'intentionally', 'spending', 'whole', 'documentary', 'explaining', 'reasons', 'why', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'seriously', 'emotionally', 'scarred', 'vulnerable', 'over-selfmedication', 'due', 'mother', 'abandoning', 'age', '9', 'stress', 'scarring', 'being', 'thrust', 'role', 'family', 'caretaker', 'young', 'age', 'attempts', 'be', 'so', 'control', 'perfect', 'mother', 'own', 'mother', 'was', 'not.Ultimately', 'may', 'be', 'definitive', 'answer', 'facts', 'evidence', 'totally', 'control', 'woman', 'was', 'depressed', 'stressed', 'notice', 'how', 'overweight', 'was', 'sign', 'overeating', 'addictive', 'behavior', 'overwhelmed', 'maybe', 'week', 'vacation', 'could', ""n't"", 'bear', 'go', 'back', 'reality', 'everyday', 'life', 'being', 'super', 'mom', 'lost', 'control', 'snapped', 'possibly', 'fit', 'ultimate', 'rage', 'own', 'mother', 'abandonment', 'innocent', 'children', 'others', 'road', 'day', 'paid', 'price']",There's Something Wrong With Aunt Diane

But for me the information presented disorganized and out of sequence, while the emotional aspect was repetitive and became counter-productive. I don't think it was intended but because it was unbiased and presented many points of view I drew a different conclusion than what was presented--that the mom/aunt/driver was at best uncated for and at worse treated abusively. Why or how her husband and family members could or would allow her to take responsibility for so many kids when she as in pain with an abscessed tooth is both irresponsible and heartless. I would have insisted on taking her to a dentist for help before the camping trip. There was a comment by the husband to the sister in law that she (Diane) wanted kids and he didn't and they were her responsibility.

1508810,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0062RY3Z8,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[36, 44]","THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH AUNT DIANE (prod./dir. Liz Garbus for HBO, 2011). Returning home from a camping vacation at Hunter Lake Campground in the Catskills on Sunday, July 26, 2009, Diane Schuler, ae.36, died in a horrific car wreck. (The date of the wreck is often misdated as 2008.)With her were five young children: her son, her daughter and three nieces. Diane was heavily investigated afterward, because it was wondered how a person could go barreling down the wrong way on a highway for an entire hour. The tox screen would say it all.Was she a secret drunk? A pot smoker extraordinaire? She suffered blinding migraines; had she suffered a stroke while driving and simply stayed at the wheel, unconscious with her eyes wide open? Did an abscessed tooth nearly kill her just before the wreck? We may never know. It could be all of these things, or none of them.Her husband, who had been with the family and departed early on his own, was almost a suspect because he did not worry too much about Diane's lateness. Yet there were so many eye witnesses - the most chilling is security video footage of Diane in her last hours, during a convenience store stop in which she seemed perfectly normal. It was known that she had gone seeking pain medication then left without buying any. Was there already something terribly wrong happening then, as many believe? The security footage shows no evidence of a problem. Remember that - it is of tremendous significance.This documentary by filmmaker Liz Garbus and presented by HBO, will lay out the facts and the confusing, aching tale of an unearthly head-on collision (the worst in New York State history) that killed Diane, her children, her nieces and the three men in the other vehicle. An unbelievable total of eight deaths. Diane's son Bryan, seven years old at the time of this writing, is the sole survivor and the film tells the incredible story of how little Bryan was saved after the terrible impact.The film also tells the story of a family and friends left in bewildered, ungodly pain. Wanting to know what occurred, during filming Diane's dental records were obtained and it was discovered that she had extreme problems, a great deal of pain and very likely, so we are told, some kind of pain medication abuse problem. Or, as the film also proposes, she was 'playing through the pain' which may have cost her and the other seven souls their lives.It was found that she had an extremely high level of alcohol and marijuana in her body at the time of the wreck - something that seemed impossible, so this film tells us. Was Diane zonked out of her mind, with everyone covering up Diane's addictions? This film will explain, as painlessly as it can manage, how this allegedly drunken, grassed-up woman devastated the nation. Many theorize - and this is not addressed in the film - that Diane may have accomplished a murder/suicide plan since she abandoned all judgment and her cell phone.Or did she just accidentally drop her cell phone?The last thing known - and the most bloodcurdling - was a cell phone call made by one of Diane's oldest nieces from the vehicle. ""There's something wrong with Aunt Diane!"" came the plaintive cry from a little girl who would not live much longer. I found it odd that the niece's cell phone wasn't traced. The film interviews eyewitnesses who saw Diane's vehicle at that time, speeding around 70 m.p.h. the wrong way, Diane seemingly frozen at the wheel.Diane's widowed husband is suing the State of New York for its badly maintained highway. Many people reacted by calling Diane a drunkard and a terrible mother. There is an opposing camp denying any addiction or drug abuse, and her widower husband leads that camp. Then again, often the spouse is the last to realize/acknowledge there is an addiction.The confusion, which as I say this film doesn't really help to dispel, is shown here in all its awful complexity. The film alleges through interviews that Diane was a known alcoholic pot smoker. Friends who have admitted Diane had problems have been accused of outright lying. The toxicology report does not lie - nor did the 2nd toxicology screen performed on Diane. It is the most painful thing, wondering how in the space of a few hours this woman drank enough Vodka to sink the Red October and smoked several joints.One horrifying fact remains, and that is Diane suffered physical problems but kept completely silent about them. A toothache that became a serious abscess (people sometimes die from these but it is uncertain whether she had developed an abscess). Migraines could have blinded her. A sudden, total loss of what we would call consciousness, or at least sight/certain brain functions, yet she continued driving at high speed in the wrong direction.It begins to look more and more like a murder/suicide but again, we will never know. Diane's family has been steadily accused of denial and neglect, viz., that they would turn a blind eye to her terrible drug abuse.If you missed this when it aired, now is the time to see this disturbing mystery. This film accomplishes a full, fair examination of the questions without judgments, though it leaves us with that sense of confusion. An all around excellent, compelling and educational film you must not miss.",5,The first Great Tragic Mystery of the 21st century....,1323216000,"12 7, 2011",2011,5270,"['SOMETHING', 'WRONG', 'WITH',

Jamele,"[85, 91]","This documentary uses 911 calls, interviews with family members and police, and security camera footage to reconstruct the events leading up the tragic car accident which killed eight people in two cars including Diane, the driver.As the story unfolds, we realize that this story is less about a mystery and more about the power of denial.  Diane's husband and sister insist that while she drank ""sometimes,"" she ""would never do that when she had to drive.""  We learn that yes, she smoked pot from time to time, ""when the laundry was folded and put away and the kids were asleep, never when she was with the kids....it was mainly to get her a good night's sleep...""Before the accident, Diane is seen on a convenience store security camera wandering around before returning to her car packed with children- was she trying to buy medication for a migraine?  We'll never know.  What we do know is that the blood tests taken on her after the accident reveal elevated alcohol and marijuana levels.  Diane's relatives don't believe the report- must be some mistake.  So they demand a retest, which reveals the same thing.  They still don't believe it- ""what are we supposed to do now?""  They meet with an expert on the subject- ""could the tests be flawed, could it be the result of a stroke from an abscessed tooth?""  No.  ""Should we dig up her body and have her tested again?""By the end of the documentary, we realize that Diane's family will simply not be convinced that Diane was in any way responsible for the accident, which occurred after Diane drove her minivan 1.7 miles at 70 MPH in the wrong direction, in the fast lane, in almost straight line, before colliding with another car (and killing everyone in that other car.)  We realize that if Diane had left a notarized suicide note, a videotaped confession, and 80 empty bottle of whiskey had been discovered scattered around the back seat, her family would probably feel exactly the same way.I'm not condemning the family- they didn't kill anyone.  They didn't force Diane to drink or smoke pot before climbing into a minivan filled with kids.  But I wonder how much of this sad denial existed before the accident, and if a little more clarity and acceptance might have been more useful to Diane than ""oh well, she only drinks and smokes pot on rare occasions."" I wonder if this almost pathological refusal to accept the truth is a thin mask for the guilt felt by Diane's family- no, We could not have done Anything, because Nothing Was Wrong.I'm reminded of people who will not accept that a family member has committed a horrible crime despite the evidence, or the family of a murder victim who are convinced that the guy in custody MUST be guilty, because it's not possible to live without some level of closure.  Diane needed help but didn't get it.  Diane's family needs help too- and I'm not sure this documentary will give them any comfort, because they don't seem to really want it.Great documentary, but it's not a mystery.",5,"Not a mystery, but a briliant study in denial",1324425600,"12 21, 2011",2011,2987,"['documentary', '911', 'calls', 'interviews', 'family', 'members', 'police', 'security', 'camera', 'footage', 'reconstruct', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'tragic', 'car', 'accident', 'killed', 'eight', 'people', 'two', 'cars', 'including', 'Diane', 'driver.As', 'story', 'unfolds', 'realize', 'story', 'less', 'mystery', 'more', 'power', 'denial', 'Diane', 'husband', 'sister', 'insist', 'sometimes', 'would', 'never', 'do', 'when', 'had', 'drive', 'learn', 'yes', 'smoked', 'pot', 'time', 'time', 'when', 'laundry', 'was', 'folded', 'put', 'away', 'kids', 'were', 'asleep', 'never', 'when', 'was', 'kids', '.it', 'was', 'mainly', 'get', 'good', 'night', 'sleep', 'accident', 'Diane', 'seen', 'convenience', 'store', 'security', 'camera', 'wandering', 'returning', 'car', 'packed', 'children-', 'was', 'trying', 'buy', 'medication', 'migraine', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'What', 'do', 'know', 'blood', 'tests', 'taken', 'accident', 'reveal', 'elevated', 'alcohol', 'marijuana', 'levels', 'Diane', 'relatives', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'report-', 'must', 'be', 'mistake', 'demand', 'retest', 'same', 'thing', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'it-', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'do', 'now', 'meet', 'expert', 'subject-', 'could', 'tests', 'be', 'flawed', 'could', 'be', 'result', 'stroke', 'abscessed', 'tooth', 'No', 'Should', 'dig', 'up', 'body', 'have', 'tested', 'again', 'end', 'documentary', 'realize', 'Diane', 'family', 'will', 'simply', 'not', 'be', 'convinced', 'Diane', 'was', 'way', 'responsible', 'accident', 'occurred', 'Diane', 'drove', 'minivan', '1.7', 'miles', '70', 'MPH', 'wrong', 'direction', 'fast', 'lane', 'almost', 'straight', 'line', 'colliding', 'car', 'killing', 'everyone', 'other', 'car', 'realize', 'Diane', 'had', 'left', 'notarized', 'suicide', 'note', 'videotaped', 'confession', '80', 'empty', 'bottle', 'whiskey', 'had', 'been', 'discovered', 'scattered', 'back', 'seat', 'family', 'would', 'probably', 'feel', 'exactly', 'same', 'way.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'condemning', 'family-', 'did', ""n't"", 'kill', 'anyone', 'did', ""n't"", 'force', 'Diane', 'drink', 'smoke', 'pot', 'climbing', 'minivan', 'filled', 'kids', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'sad', 'denial', 'existed', 'accident', 'little', 'more', 'clarity', 'acceptance', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'useful', 'Diane', 'oh', 'well', 'only', 'drinks', 'smokes', 'pot', 'rare', 'occasions', 'wonder', 'almost', 'pathological', 'refusal', 'accept', 'truth', 'thin', 'mask', 'guilt', 'felt', 'Diane', 'family-', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'Anything', 'Nothing', 'Was', 'Wrong.I', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'accept', 'family', 'member', 'committed', 'horrible', 'crime', 'evidence', 'family', 'murder', 'victim', 'who', 'are', 'convinced', 'guy', 'custody', 'MUST', 'be', 'guilty', 'not', 'possible', 'live', 'level', 'closure', 'Diane', 'needed', 'help', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Diane', 'family', 'help', 'too-', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'documentary', 'will', 'give', 'comfort', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'really', 'want', 'it.Great', 'documentary', 'not', 'mystery']",There's Something Wrong With Aunt Diane

It's an interesting documentary to watch and figure out what happened and to formulate your own thoughts on.  It was very sad though too.Opinion spoilers below so read only after watching it if you don't want those before viewing (that is my suggestion to read only after watching).I feel very sorry for the son who survived and will likely see this documentary some day.  There were some things said and showed in it that will just pile on the world of grief he'll already have to deal with because of the accident and the loss from it.And I felt so bad for the parents of the girls, what a tremendous loss and also for the family of those killed in the vehicle that was hit.  I wish a little more focus/time had been given to those men lost in that vehicle because they seemed like really nice people and a good/strong family and I would have liked to have learned more about them.The family of Diane is in denial. I understand it would be an incredibly hard situation to face, but banding together in that denial isn't helping anybody.  So much loss from that accident, what good does it do anyone healing from that to stick to that kind of denial?I felt it was very distasteful to show pictures of her dead body.  What was the point of that?  It was gruesome and unnecessary.She most likely wasn't a bad person, but she made a very bad choice that day that had immeasurable consequences.  That is the reality. You can be a good person and make mistakes, even bad ones. Someone like her who is taking care of everyone else, highly together on the outside, a perfectionist, is perfectly capable of hiding a drinking problem. Especially if those in her life aren't that aware or attentive to her, just concerned about what she can do for them which is often the case around a personality like that.  Or maybe she didn't have a drinking problem at all, but she was drunk that day. The tests were run several times and came back the same that she was drunk and the results matched to her dna.  She wasn't driving the wrong way on the highway for no reason and the alcohol didn't beam itself into her body.  The husband and sister in law need to face that reality and they owe it to the family of those who were lost to acknowledge the truth of what happened.  To say something like I have no idea why she chose to drink that day, it was completely out of character and we don't understand it, but it happened and we are so sorry that it did.  Hopefully they can get to that place together. Accept the actions of Diane's and any role they had in what led up to them. Because real healing can only begin when people are honest and confront the truth of a situation.It was also frustrating in how many questions went unanswered and you are left to just speculate on.  Why was one person taking care of that many kids. Had she drank the night before and some was still in her system.  What led her to drink that day. They drop a bomb of a statement that the husband wished he'd never had kids and resented her for being left as a single Dad.  That kind of thing gives a lot of insight into the situation, but again just speculation because that area wasn't explored any further.",3,"Interesting to watch, some things should have been left out, some given more time",1401753600,"06 3, 2014",2014,3247,"['watched', 'couple', 'days', 'ago', 'still', 'going', 'around', 'head', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'watch', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'formulate', 'own', 'thoughts', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'too.Opinion', 'spoilers', 'so', 'read', 'only', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'viewing', 'suggestion', 'read', 'only', 'watching', '.I', 'feel', 'very', 'sorry', 'son', 'who', 'survived', 'will', 'likely', 'see', 'documentary', 'day', 'were', 'things', 'said', 'showed', 'will', 'just', 'pile', 'world', 'grief', ""'ll"", 'already', 'have', 'deal', 'accident', 'loss', 'it.And', 'felt', 'so', 'bad', 'parents', 'girls', 'what', 'tremendous', 'loss', 'also', 'family', 'killed', 'vehicle', 'was', 'hit', 'wish', 'little', 'more', 'focus/time', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'men', 'lost', 'vehicle', 'seemed', 'really', 'nice', 'people', 'good/strong', 'family', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'learned', 'more', 'them.The', 'family', 'Diane', 'denial', 'understand', 'would', 'be', 'incredibly', 'hard', 'situation', 'face', 'banding', 'together', 'denial', ""n't"", 'helping', 'anybody', 'So', 'much', 'loss', 'accident', 'what', 'good', 'do', 'anyone', 'healing', 'stick', 'kind', 'denial', 'felt', 'was', 'very', 'distasteful', 'show', 'pictures', 'dead', 'body', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'was', 'gruesome', 'unnecessary.She', 'most', 'likely', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'person', 'made', 'very', 'bad', 'choice', 'day', 'had', 'immeasurable', 'consequences', 'reality', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'person', 'make', 'mistakes', 'even', 'bad', 'ones', 'Someone', 'who', 'taking', 'care', 'everyone', 'else', 'highly', 'together', 'outside', 'perfectionist', 'perfectly', 'capable', 'hiding', 'drinking', 'problem', 'Especially', 'life', 'are', ""n't"", 'aware', 'attentive', 'just', 'concerned', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'often', 'case', 'personality', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'drinking', 'problem', 'was', 'drunk', 'day', 'tests', 'were', 'run', 'several', 'times', 'came', 'back', 'same', 'was', 'drunk', 'results', 'matched', 'dna', 'was', ""n't"", 'driving', 'wrong', 'way', 'highway', 'reason', 'alcohol', 'did', ""n't"", 'beam', 'body', 'husband', 'sister', 'law', 'need', 'face', 'reality', 'owe', 'family', 'who', 'were', 'lost', 'acknowledge', 'truth', 'what', 'happened', 'say', 'something', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'chose', 'drink', 'day', 'was', 'completely', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'happened', 'are', 'so', 'sorry', 'did', 'Hopefully', 'can', 'get', 'place', 'together', 'Accept', 'actions', 'Diane', 'role', 'had', 'what', 'led', 'up', 'real', 'healing', 'can', 'only', 'begin', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'honest', 'truth', 'situation.It', 'was', 'also', 'frustrating', 'how', 'many', 'questions', 'went', 'unanswered', 'are', 'left', 'just', 'speculate', 'Why', 'was', 'one', 'person', 'taking', 'care', 'many', 'kids', 'Had', 'drank', 'night', 'was', 'still', 'system', 'What', 'led', 'drink', 'day', 'drop', 'bomb', 'statement', 'husband', 'wished', ""'d"", 'never', 'had', 'kids', 'resented', 'being', 'left', 'single', 'Dad', 'kind', 'thing', 'lot', 'insight', 'situation', 'again', 'just', 'speculation', 'area', 'was', ""n't"", 'explored', 'further']",There's Something Wrong With Aunt Diane

He never mentions his deceased daughter at all, and the thing that seems to distress him most, judging by his behavior, is that he misses his late wife's $100,000 yearly paycheck.Jay declares that as far as she knew, Diane only smoked pot very occasionally, at bedtime to help her sleep. Then Jay lights up a cigarette for the camera and says with a little chuckle that no one knows she smokes. Hmm.While Bryan pages through the special photo album Daddy made for him, there is a photo of his deceased sister Erin holding a beer bottle. Nice.Then, these two sit at a table with Dr. Werner Spitz, one of the most respected forensic pathologist of his time, and after he kindly explains to them that he finds the pathology reports on Diane to be correct, they ask him with straight faces if he feels there may have been a mistake and if they should have her body exhumed.

1508822,A2G6GBJV6PJ79D,B0062RY3Z8,"Skillet Black ""Three Seasons""","[1, 1]","I watched this when it first came out on HBO. First: One thing they do not prepare you for....they show photos of Diane's dead body at the crash site. The documentary gives you a timeline of what should have taken Diane Shuler 45 minutes to feed the children and drive them home ended up five hours later in a fiery crash that took the lives of 4 adults and 4 children. Diane Schuler was a super mom who worked at a high end level job was the bread winner and primary caregiver to her two small children I almost want to say 3 children as her husband is an unlikeable whiney selfish man who clearly depended on Dianne to do it all. Everyone says she was a planner....never leaving anything to chance. A woman who loved her family and took 3 nieces camping, like she had done many times before. So what made this day so different?? After the crash Diane' body was found to have nearly two times over the legal limit for alcohol  and also large amounts of marijuana in her system. All this, while driving around  with 5 children. Diane's husband went into defensive mode disputing scientific tests claiming he didn't know where the alcohol came from. Although a large alcohol bottle was found in the mini van. He claims they never smoked pot. When you listen to all the inferences.....it was a wonder how Diane kept it together this long...with this loser of a husband. A man who bitterly complains about having to take care of his son. clean house and do dishes.... although his sister keeps her brothers child a great deal of the time. Meanwhile Diane's husband sits around doing something close to nothing...while someone else is watching his surviving child. It is most unnerving to see the video of Diane pulling the Mini Van into a little gas station store looking for over the counter pain reliever. Then the accounts of people who watched Diane drive 1.7 miles on the highway...going the wrong way....are gripping. Two witnesses claim Diane had a serene look on her face as she nearly crashes into them head on, going 70 miles an hour. The accounts of people who were first at the scene...also chilling. While Diane's brother and his wife (Who's entire family was wiped out...3 beautiful girls...all under the age of 8) declined to be part of the documentary it is their oldest who desperately tries to reach out telling her dad (Diane's brother) that &#34;Something is wrong with Aunt Diane.&#34; Several wrong phone numbers are dialed from the phone...that is...until Diane leaves her cell (Not dropped but placed on a ledge) at an exit near Terrytown. Before they learn the autopsy results....(Diane is buried along with her daughter  next to her three nieces. An action that Warren and Jackie Hance divulge to friends and other family....that they strongly regret burying their daughters next to the woman who purposely drank and did drugs...causing the accident to happen. The documentary tries to give Diane the benefit of the doubt....did she have an abscessed tooth that caused her to misjudge how much she drank? (trying to alleviate the pain?) What I liked best about this flick was that it truly did not bias you one way or the other...it just presented the evidence. Personally....I think Diane's husband is the key. He is a compulsive liar who disputes facts that...cant be refuted and yet he does it. I think they had words at the campsite that morning. I think she had a splitting headache and decided to cure it herself as she had done in the past...with alcohol. I think the more she drank....the more depressed and suicidal she became. Clearly her thought process was jumbled. I think Dianne decided she would punish her husband...let him fend for himself without her. However, I think her judgment only regulated to herself and she stopped thinking about the kids. She also left her cell because she didn't want to be talked out of her decision. The only bright spot ...... during the filming of this documentary.....Warren and Jackie Hance learned they were pregnant.",4,A documentary that in many ways answers the questions it asks.,1402963200,"06 17, 2014",2014,3993,"['watched', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'HBO', 'First', 'One', 'thing', 'do', 'not', 'prepare', '.they', 'show', 'photos', 'Diane', 'dead', 'body', 'crash', 'site', 'documentary', 'timeline', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'Diane', 'Shuler', '45', 'minutes', 'feed', 'children', 'drive', 'home', 'ended', 'up', 'five', 'hours', 'later', 'fiery', 'crash', 'took', 'lives', '4', 'adults', '4', 'children', 'Diane', 'Schuler', 'was', 'super', 'mom', 'who', 'worked', 'high', 'end', 'level', 'job', 'was', 'bread', 'winner', 'primary', 'caregiver', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'almost', 'want', 'say', '3', 'children', 'husband', 'unlikeable', 'whiney', 'selfish', 'man', 'who', 'clearly', 'depended', 'Dianne', 'do', 'Everyone', 'was', 'planner', '.never', 'leaving', 'anything', 'chance', 'A', 'woman', 'who', 'loved', 'family', 'took', '3', 'nieces', 'camping', 'had', 'done', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'what', 'made', 'day', 'so', 'different', 'crash', 'Diane', 'body', 'was', 'found', 'have', 'nearly', 'two', 'times', 'legal', 'limit', 'alcohol', 'also', 'large', 'amounts', 'marijuana', 'system', 'driving', 'around', '5', 'children', 'Diane', 'husband', 'went', 'defensive', 'mode', 'disputing', 'scientific', 'tests', 'claiming', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'alcohol', 'came', 'large', 'alcohol', 'bottle', 'was', 'found', 'mini', 'van', 'never', 'smoked', 'pot', 'When', 'listen', 'inferences', '..it', 'was', 'wonder', 'how', 'Diane', 'kept', 'together', 'long', 'loser', 'husband', 'man', 'who', 'bitterly', 'having', 'take', 'care', 'son', 'clean', 'house', 'do', 'dishes', 'sister', 'brothers', 'child', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'Meanwhile', 'Diane', 'husband', 'doing', 'something', 'close', 'nothing', 'someone', 'else', 'watching', 'surviving', 'child', 'most', 'unnerving', 'see', 'video', 'Diane', 'pulling', 'Mini', 'Van', 'little', 'gas', 'station', 'store', 'looking', 'counter', 'pain', 'reliever', 'Then', 'accounts', 'people', 'who', 'watched', 'Diane', 'drive', '1.7', 'miles', 'highway', 'going', 'wrong', 'way', '.are', 'gripping', 'Two', 'witnesses', 'claim', 'Diane', 'had', 'serene', 'look', 'face', 'nearly', 'crashes', 'head', 'going', '70', 'miles', 'hour', 'accounts', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'first', 'scene', 'also', 'chilling', 'Diane', 'brother', 'wife', 'Who', 'entire', 'family', 'was', 'wiped', 'out', '3', 'beautiful', 'girls', 'age', '8', 'declined', 'be', 'part', 'documentary', 'oldest', 'who', 'desperately', 'reach', 'out', 'telling', 'dad', 'Diane', 'brother', '34', 'Something', 'wrong', 'Aunt', 'Diane.', '34', 'Several', 'wrong', 'phone', 'numbers', 'are', 'dialed', 'phone', 'Diane', 'cell', 'Not', 'dropped', 'placed', 'ledge', 'exit', 'Terrytown', 'learn', 'autopsy', 'results', 'Diane', 'buried', 'daughter', 'next', 'three', 'nieces', 'action', 'Warren', 'Jackie', 'Hance', 'divulge', 'friends', 'other', 'family', '.that', 'strongly', 'regret', 'burying', 'daughters', 'woman', 'who', 'purposely', 'drank', 'did', 'drugs', 'causing', 'accident', 'happen', 'documentary', 'tries', 'give', 'Diane', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'have', 'abscessed', 'tooth', 'caused', 'misjudge', 'how', 'much', 'drank', 'trying', 'alleviate', 'pain', 'What', 'liked', 'best', 'flick', 'was', 'truly', 'did', 'not', 'bias', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'just', 'presented', 'evidence', 'Personally', '.I', 'think', 'Diane', 'husband', 'key', 'compulsive', 'liar', 'who', 'facts', 'cant', 'be', 'refuted', 'yet', 'think', 'had', 'words', 'campsite', 'morning', 'think', 'had', 'splitting', 'headache', 'decided', 'cure', 'had', 'done', 'past', 'alcohol', 'think', 'more', 'drank', '.the', 'more', 'depressed', 'suicidal', 'became', 'Clearly', 'thought', 'process', 'was', 'jumbled', 'think', 'Dianne', 'decided', 'would', 'punish', 'husband', 'let', 'fend', 'However', 'think', 'judgment', 'only', 'regulated', 'herself', 'stopped', 'thinking', 'kids', 'also', 'left', 'cell', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'talked', 'decision', 'only', 'bright', 'spot', 'filming', 'documentary', '..Warren', 'Jackie', 'Hance', 'learned', 'were', 'pregnant']",There's Something Wrong With Aunt Diane
