1691724,A3BMUBUC1N77U8,B00HRFSYCC,ahoffoss,"[2, 2]","I originally was going to give this a 3 star rating because to me it was just an entertaining movie that I didn't really think too much about.  HOWEVER, after giving it a little thought, I decided to up it to a 4 because I can honestly see myself going back and rewatching it numerous times.  It does seem to be the type of movie that, when watched multiple times, gets funnier and funnier each time.  I really hope this ends up on TBS or some sort of station, because people that probably wouldn't give it the time of day might sit and watch it.  It really is a funny movie the more I think about it!For starters, DO NOT go by the IMDB summary.  That is the first (and probably) only time I will ever say that, as I love IMDB.  However, their summary makes the movie seem like an all out horror/thriller.  It's not.  That's one thing that confused me when I started to watch it.  I was under the impression that I was watching a serious indie, horror, flick and as soon as the first scene ended, I was slightly confused.  This IS more a comedy than anything (in my opinion).  But again, with so many of the same type movies out, it's good for a change of pace.The story follows 3 friends: Craig (Matthew Albrecht), Lance (Isaac Harrison), and Tom (Dru Lockwood) along with Craig's cousin, Jerry (Jarrod Pistilli) on their hunting trip to Buck Wild Ranch.  Honestly, if not for Jerry, I probably wouldn't have continued watching this movie.  But his comedy timing was perfect and kept me interested in finding out what he was going to do next.  Upon entering town, they meet up with local, self-proclaimed ""badass"", Billy Ray (Mark Ford).  This guy, I actually know some guys who could be him, so I was pretty entertained in his character.  Either way, this is the first time you really get the sense of how Jerry is and why the other 2 guys didn't want him to come along.After arriving they encounter the ranch's owner, Clyde (Joe Stevens) and his daughter, Candy (Meg Cionni).  It's apparent something is wrong with Clyde (dealing with the movies opening scene), but the guys chalk it up as his personality.  That night, Craig reveals his intentions to marry his girlfriend of six years, Carla.  This causes Lance to get uncomfortable and rush off and leads Isaac to reveal that Carla is cheating on Craig with Lance.  He even has pictures to prove it.This pretty much sets up the movie and I must say, I don't want to spoil anymore because it has some REALLY funny scenes throughout.  So if you're in the mood to get a good laugh while being (somewhat) grossed out, this movie is perfect for you!Final Verdict:  RENT IT!  It's good for a laugh.If you found my review to be helpful please let me know by clicking the ""yes"" button below so I feel like I'm doing something right.

1691727,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00HRFSYCC,Matthew Scott Baker,"[0, 0]","Don&#8217;t let the title fool you; this is not a new addition to the AMERICAN PIE franchise, nor is it the suggested title for the next HANGOVER film.  BUCK WILD is a rowdy, darkly humorous venture into zombie-comedy territory, filled with gore and goofs alike.  And while it is not perfect, it is a lot of fun and certainly worthy of attention.As I&#8217;ve mentioned in previous posts, I love horror-comedies.  I&#8217;m always fascinated to see how humor can be interjected into some of horror&#8217;s most popular and intense concepts.  And because I&#8217;m a huge zombie fan, finding humor with them makes a film that much better.BUCK WILD is shot well for the most part and looks good onscreen.  There are a couple of camera shots that made me raise an eyebrow and wonder why that particular spot was chosen; but otherwise, the cinematography is pretty solid.  Likewise, the acting is good, too.  I particularly like the diversity of the cast.  Director Tyler Glodt did a great job in casting the four primary characters, and each actor is to be commended in their roles.  They are an over-the-top bunch with larger than life personas, but that works perfectly in a film like this.The special effects are mostly well done, and there&#8217;s plenty of gore to go around.  From mutilated animals to gunshot blood-sprays, we get a nice dose of carnage onscreen.  I say the effects are mostly well done because some of the zombie effects looked a bit cheap.  The close-up shots look great&#8230;but there are several background zombies that barely look made up at all.  I figured this was due to budget constraints, but it was noticeable enough to bring up.Despite it&#8217;s small flaws, BUCK WILD is entertaining and funny.  The characters are boisterous and full of life, which injects a lot of energy into this production.  I recommend giving the film a look if you&#8217;re looking for off-the-wall fun and zany, gory comedy.

The group includes his skirt chasing BFF Lance (Isaac Harrison) who is also friends with Craig's girlfriend Carla. Tom is the third member of this group. He is not an outdoors type and his manhood is in constant question by Texans. Jerry (Jarrod Pistilli) is the stranger. He is Craig's visiting cousin from New York. He has with him a duffel bag which he guards. He also has an encyclopedia knowledge of the Chupacabra, the topic of many bad horror films and something we saw before the opening credits. Clearly he has plans of his own as Clyde's (Joe Stevens) ranch has had reported sightings.The rival ranch is run by self proclaimed bad a**  Billy Ray (Mark Ford) who wears a boa and is apparently British (accent and flag in home).  The film doesn't give you any odd twists. The characters are what makes the film an enjoyment to watch. The Chupacabra bite turns people into zombies.
