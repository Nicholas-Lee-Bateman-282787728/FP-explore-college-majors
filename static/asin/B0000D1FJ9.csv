""Night_Hawk07""","[2, 2]","Big Brother 3 is the best season of them all, with many varied houseguests and a lot of standouts (Amy, Marcellas...) and this DVD is great to relive the moments again and again since this season originally aired in 2002.The DVD is decent. The only special feature is some footage from the producers interviewing each houseguest which disappointed me cause I was hoping they would show the ORIGINAL tapes that the houseguests sent in to CBS.The packaging is the weakest. The box isn't very sturdy and a plastic cases holds four discs. The box would be smaller and less cheap if they used individual slit cases (like FOX uses) and put two discs in each.Overall, a great buy.",5,"The best season of ""Big Brother""",1124755200,"08 23, 2005",2005,673,"['Big', 'Brother', '3', 'best', 'season', 'many', 'varied', 'houseguests', 'lot', 'standouts', 'Amy', 'Marcellas', 'DVD', 'great', 'relive', 'moments', 'again', 'again', 'season', 'originally', 'aired', '2002.The', 'DVD', 'decent', 'only', 'special', 'feature', 'footage', 'producers', 'interviewing', 'houseguest', 'disappointed', 'cause', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'show', 'ORIGINAL', 'tapes', 'houseguests', 'sent', 'CBS.The', 'packaging', 'weakest', 'box', ""n't"", 'very', 'sturdy', 'plastic', 'cases', 'four', 'discs', 'box', 'would', 'be', 'smaller', 'less', 'cheap', 'used', 'individual', 'slit', 'cases', 'FOX', 'uses', 'put', 'two', 'discs', 'each.Overall', 'great', 'buy']",Big Brother 3 - The Complete Season
777004,A3Q66OKHQ0FJUA,B0000D1FJ9,Ben Benji,"[2, 3]","If you like BB USA and have not sean this season this dvd set is worth a buy.Three plastic cases hold nine disks which contain thirty two episodes. The disks can slip free in the plastic cases during transit.  The plastic cases come in a less than sturdy cardbox box.  For the most part the packaging is attractive and it does not reveal who the winner is.The extras are cast interviews from before they went into the house.The episodes are presented for the most part I would imagine as originally aired.  However there are a couple of obvious edits.  At the end of episode 14 host Julie invites viewers to come back for (more?) news of an exciting twist after the break.  Sadly the screen fades to black and the disk goes straight to the main menu.  This happens on about 5-7 episodes.  I think there might have been some interactive viewer option during these missing segments but as they were a part of the programme they should be included.  During the last few episodes we get a few on screen banners informing us that Survivor: Thailand starts in a few weeks.Also, the ending credits are missing for every episode.  The last disk has a feature where some very poor end credits are on offer which do not even have any music playing.When you put the disk in your machine the disk goes straight to the main menu (there is no FBI warning) which gives you option to select an episode to watch as the theme music plays.  There are no play all, subtitles or audio options available.The picture quality is very good and I would have given 4 stars if it was not for the pointless edits on a few episodes as mentioned.",3,Episodes are not complete,1211587200,"05 24, 2008",2008,1615,"['like', 'BB', 'USA', 'have', 'not', 'sean', 'season', 'dvd', 'set', 'buy.Three', 'plastic', 'cases', 'hold', 'nine', 'disks', 'contain', 'thirty', 'two', 'episodes', 'disks', 'can', 'slip', 'free', 'plastic', 'cases', 'transit', 'plastic', 'cases', 'come', 'less', 'sturdy', 'cardbox', 'box', 'most', 'part', 'packaging', 'attractive', 'not', 'reveal', 'who', 'winner', 'is.The', 'extras', 'are', 'cast', 'interviews', 'went', 'house.The', 'episodes', 'are', 'presented', 'most', 'part', 'would', 'imagine', 'originally', 'aired', 'However', 'are', 'couple', 'obvious', 'edits', 'end', 'episode', '14', 'host', 'Julie', 'viewers', 'come', 'back', 'more', 'news', 'exciting', 'twist', 'break', 'Sadly', 'screen', 'black', 'disk', 'straight', 'main', 'menu', '5-7', 'episodes', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'interactive', 'viewer', 'option', 'missing', 'segments', 'were', 'part', 'programme', 'should', 'be', 'included', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'get', 'few', 'screen', 'banners', 'informing', 'Survivor', 'Thailand', 'few', 'weeks.Also', 'ending', 'credits', 'are', 'missing', 'episode', 'last', 'disk', 'feature', 'where', 'very', 'poor', 'end', 'credits', 'are', 'offer', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'have', 'music', 'playing.When', 'put', 'disk', 'machine', 'disk', 'straight', 'main', 'menu', 'FBI', 'warning', 'option', 'select', 'episode', 'watch', 'theme', 'music', 'are', 'play', 'all', 'subtitles', 'audio', 'options', 'available.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'would', 'have', 'given', '4', 'stars', 'was', 'not', 'pointless', 'few', 'episodes', 'mentioned']",Big Brother 3 - The Complete Season

Though I am very glad to have the entire season, and I can re-live all the moments of the best 'Big Brother' to date, I do have some criticisms, particularly with the last disc in the set. The disc is quite clearly Volume 9, though the spine of the case reads  'Volumes 6-8.' At least two of the episodes near the end of the season were not re-edited for the DVD, because you will still see CBS insignia reminding you to watch Survivor Amazon in one week.

I'd forgotten alot of Season 3 - Amy &amp; Marcellus, Chiara &amp; Roddy, Lisa &amp; Eric, Danielle &amp; Jason... and good ole Gerry.The fighting, the loving, Amy leaving then returning, Marcellus and his decision with the Golden Veto, Danielle and her comments in the Diary room - I loved all of it and was saddened when I finished watching it again.The only &quot;extras&quot; are the audition tapes of the contestants.  Interesting but I wish there were more &quot;extras&quot; such as comments from the House Guests or Julie Chen.  Maybe the producers will add more on the next Big Brother DVD release.  (Hopefully they will release more).My biggest beef is with the packaging.  I received the set with several DVDs loose inside their jewel box.  A friend of mine received her set with alot of scratches on the DVDs.  Instead of having each DVD attached inside, two DVDs &quot;share&quot; the same space, one an inch or two down from the other.  The &quot;top&quot; DVD on each side is supposed to hold down the other one but comes loose so they both rattle around.Another thing - I've noticed Amazon has raised alot of their prices and this is no exception.

There were some very memorable characters, including one of most well-known houseguests to come out of the show, Marcellas.So what is there that makes Season 3 worth watching? We saw one of the most successful and secretive alliances of BB history. One of the steamiest romances to ever happen in the BB house took place during season 3. There was also an annoying Dr. Will wannabe who thankfully didn't last too long. Which brings me to my biggest question to CBS - why Season 3? If you're going for historical value, Season 2 had arguably one of the best BB players ever. A man who was hated by the houseguests managed to stick around until the end, then gave one of the most offensive final speeches ever, but still managed to get enough votes to win the game!Anyway, if we can't have season 2, then season 3 is probably the next best thing.

I liked the mix of people, the conflicts, the twists, and overall friendship among the house guests.  I rooted for Roddy to win, followed by Jason.  I loved the comedic talents of Danielle, Roddy, and Marcellas, though I don't agree with Danielle that Roddy was &quot;the devil&quot;.  This season offered memorable moments, like Amy coming back into the house after two weeks in Mexico and how her drinking drove her housemates mad, Eric talking in his sleep, witty and whiny Josh, the &quot;stripper mascarading as a mother&quot;, Marcellas and his beloved gnome named &quot;Boo&quot;, Jason and Danielle's well kept secret alliance, Eric and Lisa's romance, Jason getting nervous over a massage, Sheryl Crow's surprise concert, and more...Lots of great moments for any reality tv show cast, and well deserving of being released on dvd.  Since BB3 aired, I haven't liked the cast of BB4 or the current BB5 cast.  I think the show hit perfection with #3.

Right up with Survivor The Australian Outback, Top Shot season 3, Anderson Cooper's The Mole and the first season of The Amazing Race, this show was nothing but perfection. A cast that delivered many great people, excellent relationships reaching all kinds of areas, emotions of all levels, great competitions, blindsides, deals, humor, great pacing, stars that landmark the show, very deserving finalists and a winner to be proud of.I really cannot praise this season anymore then I already have. I loved it from start to finish. Even people I had issues with at times all redeemed themselves both in the show and for me. I loved the intensity as the cast dwlindled and am extremely happy at the results.If you have not seen this season you do not know what you are missing and if you manage to be able to view it, get viewing this gem of a show.Spoiler Alert****Spoiler Alert*****Spoiler Alert*****Spoiler Alert*****Spoiler Alert*****Spoiler Alert*****Spoiler AlertNow about the final decision. I really did love the winner, while there were times Lisa did fly low, I think possibly one reason we think that is, because she won the first HOH we expected more of her. I felt she a great job of allining herself and making her decisions. However it is slightly dissapointing for Danielle and Jason to loose their control right at then end, they played it so well. But it wouldn't have mattered, Danielle wouldn't have beaten Jason.

There are annoying houseguests, houseguests you can't help but love, and tons of fighting and scheming.This season, the houseguests had a surprise visit from Sheryl Crow, the introduction of the Power of Veto, and the first season to have an evicted houseguest return to the house.You might be thinking that once you've seen the season, you won't want to watch it again. Thanks to the way the show is put together, that is not so. Not only will it not matter that you know who won the game, you'll revel in listening to conversations knowing the outcome. Each time you watch an episode, you'll probably pick up on bits of conversation you never noticed before, making the season much more rich than before.This DVD comes with sparse extra features, but what is included is great. We get to see the audition tapes of the houseguests.I must complain that this was the first and only season to be fully released on DVD. Season 2 was the best in my opinion, and SHOULD have been released prior to this one.",4,Great Reality Show,1130025600,"10 23, 2005",2005,1179,"['Join', 'Amy', 'Marcellus', 'Danielle', 'Gerry', 'Jason', 'Roddy', 'Chiara', 'Lori', 'Tanya', 'Eric', 'Lisa', 'Josh', 'three', 'month', 'adventure', 'had', 'right', 'confines', 'Big', 'Brother', 'house', 'are', 'annoying', 'houseguests', 'houseguests', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'tons', 'fighting', 'scheming.This', 'season', 'houseguests', 'had', 'surprise', 'visit', 'Sheryl', 'Crow', 'introduction', 'Power', 'Veto', 'first', 'season', 'have', 'evicted', 'houseguest', 'return', 'house.You', 'might', 'be', 'thinking', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'season', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'Thanks', 'way', 'show', 'put', 'together', 'not', 'so', 'Not', 'only', 'will', 'not', 'matter', 'know', 'who', 'won', 'game', ""'ll"", 'revel', 'listening', 'conversations', 'knowing', 'outcome', 'time', 'watch', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'pick', 'up', 'bits', 'conversation', 'never', 'noticed', 'making', 'season', 'much', 'more', 'rich', 'before.This', 'DVD', 'sparse', 'extra', 'features', 'what', 'included', 'great', 'get', 'see', 'audition', 'tapes', 'houseguests.I', 'must', 'complain', 'was', 'first', 'only', 'season', 'be', 'fully', 'released', 'DVD', 'Season', '2', 'was', 'best', 'opinion', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'prior', 'one']",Big Brother 3 - The Complete Season
777019,A1B9ISLYYCHIVE,B0000D1FJ9,"The Curmudgeon ""Your life lacks purpose - my ...","[1, 6]","Let me clear something up first - this isn't aimed at THIS particular version of Big Brother. Hell, I'm from the UK so I won't even have SEEN this. Not that I watch ANY of Big Brother or any of it's charmless, cheap TV knock-off counterparts.But it doesn't really matter. Who needs to have seen this particular series - it's all the same, full of phony, desperate, loathsome idiots out to become famous for doing absolutley nothing. Without watching this, I can predict thata) People will fight and argue for NO REASON AT ALL.b) There will be an extrovert (probably gay) housemate. Or more than one (if recent UK versions are anything to go by).c) Two people will fumble around under the bedclothes with each other in a tired attempt to become a household name.Well, was I right? I bet I was, because this format of program has become so jaded, cynical and worn out that you can almost predict what's going to happen, what the newspapers are going to salivate over the next day.Big Brother is the epitome of scum television - TV aimed at people who don't have either the patience or intelligence to watch a real program, (you know, one with a plot and actors and stuff). These people, these scum - can't watch a program without wanting to phone in and vote someone off.Worse than people who watch (and talk about) it? The people who buy the DVD's. Yes, you too can own a version of attention craving morons sitting around in a house. These people, who's names you will forget in three weeks time, will entertain and delight you in totally forced, ""oh, is the camera on me? I got naked and they SHOWED IT???"" antics.If this sounds like your sort of thing, may I suggest three other things you may need in your life? A nice, sturdy wooden chair, a solid hook in the ceiling above you, and a lovely big noose.

777020,AJQH2XUBV7VEY,B0000D1FJ9,Triton,"[0, 0]","Seeing as the price for this set now hovers around $50 for the cheapest copy (including shipping), I was a little frightened to spend that much money. The set is nine discs, with four episodes per disc, which is an entire cycle: Eviction/HOH, Nominations, Veto, Veto Meeting. I had forgotten that the veto competition and the Veto meeting were different episodes in season 3. One really nice thing is that as soon as you put the disc in, it goes straight to the menu. There isn't that five minute thing that most DVD's have, with FBI warnings and such. The show appears to be exactly what was broadcast, so that settled my fears. If you are a fan of Big Brother and can afford the hefty price, now that it's out of print, I'd say go for it. The packaging isn't perfect, as the other reviews mentioned, but beyond that I don't see a flaw. If this season and the clip-show version of Season 4 are all that we get, then I'll take what I can get.
