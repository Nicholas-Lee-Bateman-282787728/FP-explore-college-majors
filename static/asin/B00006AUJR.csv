710323,A3B1V3AUUV13R6,B00006AUJR,Adrien Caldwell,"[0, 1]",I will not go into lengthy detail about this movie as it already has nearly 300 reviews already.I watched this film for the first time nearly ten years after its debut. I enjoyed how the movie left all the gruesomeness to the viewer's imagination. I thought the story was well laid out and of course there is a twist toward the end.Perhaps the only thing I would suggest is that the movie had a lightheartedness about it that left me unaffected by the movie. What I mean by that is after I view a scary movie I am usually haunted by it and think about it for hours afterward. I personally think a good scary movie is good because it has the ability to leave you feeling affected in some haunting or disturbing way. I did enjoy this movie a lot but after the film ended within minutes I found myself thinking about other things in the back of my mind. Not that what I am going to say has any correlation but due to the fact that Frailty has a religious theme to it I just wanted to mention that the movie Stigmata (1999) with Patricia Arquette is a religious based thriller that had me absorbed into the storyline for quite some time after I finished viewing it.But overall I am glad I watched it and I would recommend this one to friends and family. It has an almost Twilight Zone and/or Alfred Hitchcock modernized quality to it.,4,Really liked it a lot!,1301702400,"04 2, 2011",2011,1330,"['will', 'not', 'go', 'lengthy', 'detail', 'movie', 'already', 'nearly', '300', 'reviews', 'already.I', 'watched', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'nearly', 'ten', 'years', 'debut', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'movie', 'left', 'gruesomeness', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'well', 'laid', 'out', 'course', 'twist', 'end.Perhaps', 'only', 'thing', 'would', 'suggest', 'movie', 'had', 'lightheartedness', 'left', 'unaffected', 'movie', 'What', 'mean', 'view', 'scary', 'movie', 'am', 'usually', 'haunted', 'think', 'hours', 'afterward', 'personally', 'think', 'good', 'scary', 'movie', 'good', 'ability', 'leave', 'feeling', 'affected', 'haunting', 'disturbing', 'way', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'lot', 'film', 'ended', 'minutes', 'found', 'thinking', 'other', 'things', 'back', 'mind', 'Not', 'what', 'am', 'going', 'say', 'correlation', 'due', 'fact', 'Frailty', 'religious', 'theme', 'just', 'wanted', 'mention', 'movie', 'Stigmata', '1999', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'religious', 'based', 'thriller', 'had', 'absorbed', 'storyline', 'quite', 'time', 'finished', 'viewing', 'it.But', 'overall', 'am', 'glad', 'watched', 'would', 'recommend', 'one', 'friends', 'family', 'almost', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'and/or', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'modernized', 'quality']",Frailty

This is one of those films that did not get a wide Theatrical release that may have slipped through the cracks. It is the story of a father and his two sons, and the fathers revelation that God has tapped them to kill demons that walk among us, to be God's hand.  While one son assumes that his father has gone crazy, the other believes in him without question.  After the kids have grown up, one of them decides to follow in their fathers footsteps and kill demons (who look like normal people) while the other eventually decides to turn in his brother for being the God's hand killer.  The movie is told in a narrative by Fenton Meiks (Matt McConaughey) as he is convincing an FBI agent that his brother is the murderer. This is a well written, suspenseful film that tears at you, and is wonderfully crafted.About the DVD:  This one is chock full of extras, including the trailer, the making of, scenes, a documentary from the Sundance channel, and three different commentaries.

He tells them that the angel said to him that he was chosen to destroy demons that would look like ordinary people. Fenton is the only boy who is against it and very disturbed by the fact that his dad is murdering people. This film was actually directed by Bill himself and he did a terrific job at it too.

A movie like Frailty does not come around frequently, believe me when I say that this is one of the best unknown flicks around. Also noteworthy is that this is a big screen directorial debut from Bill Paxton (Twister, Apollo 13, A Simple Plan) who really impressed me on various levels, I always enjoyed seeing him on the big screen as an actor but now that I know what he is capable of, I am sure that I will enjoy him in whatever future project he might be attached to.This movie gives you one of those *old-school* horror/thriller moody feelings. It is set in present day but it is told through flashbacks of the late 1970s. We are introduced to the Meiks family, Dad Meiks is a typical Texan who takes care of his two boys, Adam & Fenton, all by himself. They do not seem like a regular religious family until one day Dad Meiks wakes up and tells his sons that an Angel appeared in his dream and told him to serve God by killing Demons disguised as humans. One of the sons, Adam thinks this is very cool and sees his father as a superhero, but Fenton thinks that his father has lost his mind and that this whole idea is absurd. He is against it from the get go but this does not stop his dad from doing what he must do, kill those who are demons. So, with a single touch, Dad Meiks can tell what that person has done and after that, yep, he kills them. So needless to say, young Fenton freaks out and tries to go up against his father but that does not go all too well, without giving anything else away, I suggest that you rent this movie and watch it carefully because you are in for a really good treat.

And those, my friends, are some very big shoes to fill.This film is enjoyable on many levels, because it teeters deliciously between stylish American Gothic horror film and Disturbing Dysfunctional Family Psychodrama.The cast is exceptional, the script is taut, the cinematography is top notch, and the atmosphere is chilling. I am a big fan of creepfests that aren't overpowering, where less is more. Give me a stormy night and a dvd of ""The Others"", or the 1963 version of ""The Haunting"", or ""Don't Look Now"".And ""Frailty"" is so original and shocking in its concept: Dad tells his two boys, ""God told me that we have to kill some of our neighbors because they're really demons"".  Wow. Heavy stuff.The ultimate boogey man nightmare is offered here because the parent, whom you love and trust completely, has become homicidal. This is powerful and extremely frightening. It shakes the foundation you stand on.This film is not a gross-out horror movie. We don't need excess gore or buckets of blood here. It's disturbing enough thematically. The scariest thing about ""Frailty"" is that this could happen in real life, may have happened. It is a horror that is potentially real in your own back yard.********SPOILER AHEAD*******PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISKMy only issue with this movie is a plot hole involving a phone conversation that Matthew McConaughey has with his brother early in the movie where he calls him by name.

710333,A1EI65WJC85U68,B00006AUJR,"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k""","[2, 2]","Directed by and Starring Bill Paxton, FRAILTY is one of the scariest and most effective horror films I've seen in a long time.A serial murderer known as the God's Hand Killer is terrorising Texas; but the police investigation into the slayings is throwing up nothing but false leads and dead ends.This changes when a man named Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey) shows up at the local police station claiming to know the identity of the killer: his brother Adam. FBI Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) listens to his story, with the principal portion of the movie told in flashback mode.This takes us back to the Summer of 1979 in rural Texas where we meet the Meiks family: The young Fenton (Matt O'Leary), Adam (Jeremy Sumpter) and their Dad (Paxton) a mechanic, who is raising the boys on his own after their mother died giving birth.At first glance the Meikses appear the epitome of a happy, loving family. But all that changes when one night Dad has a dream in which an angel visits him and warns him  that demons are taking over the World to prepare for the forthcoming apocalypse. God will give Dad the power to be able to see inside people's heads to identify if they're demons or not, the Meikses will be the only people to know of this. If the people are demons, then Dad must kill them. He will receive automatic immunity from this because by disposing of them Dad is doing God's Will (What ever happened to Thou shalt not kill? Talk about hypocrisy!). Dad and his sons will be among the only survivors if they obey. Judgment Day is coming (minus Arnie).So Dad gets to work. God's Will involves kidnapping ""sinners"" and imprisoning them in his barn; then forcing the boys to watch while he kills them with his trusty ax. (The murders themselves aren't shown). What a model father! Then Fenton and Adam are given the job of burying the bodies in the rose garden-a popular place for burying the deceased in the movies.It becomes blatantly obvious that as the bodies pile up and Dad makes the boys start digging a shelter that will keep them safe from the end of the World; that their father has become a major league fruit cake, with extra nuts.Criticism aside, in general I found FRAILTY to be a film about a man who loves his sons but is severely mentally ill, driven over the edge by mania; with his fundamentalist dogma psychologically scarring his sons for life. Thus creating the Adam who would go on to become the God's Hand Killer. (Personally I'd like to think God is jolly like Santa- but then again Santa is an anagram of Satan!!).FRAILTY works brilliantly mainly because the horror it portrays is chillingly plausible, so kudos must go to writer Brett Hanley. It takes a little while for the viewer to get fully involved, but once it gets going FRAILTY is a great little horror/thriller with a climactic twist you won't see coming.If you enjoyed movies like ROSEMARY'S BABY and JEEPERS CREEPERS you'll have a lot of fun with this one. FRAILTY is one of those movies that inevitably will anger fundamentalist Christians (Gee, I wonder who?). Thankfully, FRAILTY went to DVD in NZ with an R16 rating and no problems- maybe this film hit too close to home for NZ's self appointed moral ""watchdogs""? Highly recommended.

I thought that it looked decent, plus I thought my mind needed a break from this 'shoot'em up' crap that the movie industry is getting filled up with. Frailty was my relief.This movie starts out in the present when a man called Fenton comes into tell the FBI that he knows who the god's hand killer is. The person head of the FBI comes in and starts to talk to Fenton. Fenton then begins to explain that the god's hand killer is infact his brother.The Head of the FBI started at first thinking that this guy is just feeding him BS. Fenton then starts to say that this all began in 1968 when his father, (the mother had passed away) and his brother and him all lived together happily. Well, it all ended when his father had a vision from a angel telling him that there are demons among the earth and that him (and his sons) must slay them. Well, Fenton knows that his father is insane. These were real people that he was slaying. So time passes and Fenton actually starts to watch as his father going on and filling out these missions. Fenton has to make a decision, desert his father or save the innocent people.This Movie freaked me out at the end. The end has a real twist that scares you, Bill Paxton did a great job as the Dad, and Matthew McConoughy (did i spell that right?)really scared me as the older version of Fenton (well... and Adam) If you don't like scary movies dont watch this, if you do watch it.

Etnyre ""roguemissive""","[2, 3]","Hollywood more often than not goes out of its way to portray religious (specifically Christian) people as heavies or villains or antagonists, or pompous hypocrites, or just plain mentally unstable nutjobs.  Even though most Americans are themselves religious and statistically Christian, Hollywood heedlessly and brazenly persists in its willful oblivion of and arrogant condescension towards the sentiments held in esteem by the majority of Americans (demonstrated again in the recent spate of anti-U.S. military films that are being released into well-deserved dismal box office failure).  Even Stephen King, an immensely capable writer whose work I have enjoyed and praised, regularly uses religious (Christian) characters as villains or at the very least as buffoonish one-dimensional stock characters meant for ridicule and disdain.  On the other hand, extremist religious sects that actually promote and practice violence are often ignored, or given a sympathetic depiction (SYRIANA), or replaced with implausible politically-correct substitutes - as in the case of the remarkable cowardice and craven pandering which turned an adequate though highly farfetched book like ""Sum of All Fears"" into the inane and excrementally insipid film SUM OF ALL FEARS.But what if someone could make a decent movie that depicts Christians as good people AND scary as well?I had not heard about FRAILTY when it was released and was not familiar with the film until it had reached the rental market.In spite of what seemed like another unflattering and stereotypically caricatured depiction of  religious (and Texan) folk, I was slightly intrigued by the storyline and thought it might make for at least relatively interesting viewing at a time of very few other promising alternatives worth renting.For those who do not know and are interested, FRAILTY tells the story of a man named Meiks (Matthew McCaugheney) who claims to have knowledge of the ""GOD's Hand killer"", a serial killer from the 70's who was never caught or even identified.  Meiks relays his alleged information to the authorities, in particular to a skeptical FBI Agent (Powers Booth) who regards Meiks as somewhat of an unsettling mystery.  The bulk of the film mainly consists of Meiks's recollection of events past and current, as presented through flashbacks and his testimony.  There is more to the plot, but I really don't want to give too much of the story away for those who want to see the film, because I think very highly of it and believe it should be seen unspoiled.Though there won't be a unanimous consensus of support for the following opinion, Bill Paxton is a capable and effective actor, though perhaps not the most skilled thespian to ever appear on screen.  Nonetheless, he is invariably believable in his character roles.  Where his even greater talent and skills seem to lie is as a director.  I have seen two of his films (FRAILTY and THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED) that he directed, and enjoyed them both.  The reason I watched THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED was because of how impressed I was with FRAILTY.  And I thought that both were skillfully made and entertaining, although they represent VERY different sensibilities of the psyche.  In addition to finding the right tone and energy and performance level for his actors, Paxton also has a talent for creative and effective visuals, even when just using relatively simple techniques.  This film does not rely on any flashy or high-tech effects, yet still makes for effective scenes.  Without giving too much away, there is a scene in FRAILTY where Bill Paxton's character is driving and sees a barn off in the middle of the countryside.  Though it is a fairly simple setting and premise, it is one of my all-time favorite sequences I have seen in movies, and possibly one of the most effective and compelling.  It's a goosebump-raiser for me, even just thinking about it while I write this.This film has some critics and detractors, in addition to the usual coterie of obnoxious loudmouths who unnecessarily spew hyperbole and exaggerated pejoratives about films that don't conform to their own narrow screed.  And in all fairness, this film may not be everyone's cup of tea.  There are those who might not like the film for their own valid reasons.  But I think it is a very impressive and engaging film - especially considering the relatively modest budget.  It is a story that is well-written and creative, as well as capably and effectively directed.",5,A uniquely non-stereotypical film that takes hold of you,1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,4491,"['Hollywood', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'way', 'portray', 'religious', 'specifically', 'Christian', 'people', 'heavies', 'villains', 'antagonists', 'pompous', 'hypocrites', 'just', 'plain', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'nutjobs', 'Even', 'most', 'Americans', 'are', 'religious', 'statistically', 'Christian', 'Hollywood', 'heedlessly', 'brazenly', 'willful', 'oblivion', 'arrogant', 'condescension', 'sentiments', 'held', 'esteem', 'majority', 'Americans', 'demonstrated', 'again', 'recent', 'spate', 'anti-U.S.', 'military', 'films', 'are', 'being', 'released', 'well-deserved', 'dismal', 'box', 'office', 'failure', 'Even', 'Stephen', 'King', 'immensely', 'capable', 'writer', 'work', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'praised', 'regularly', 'uses', 'religious', 'Christian', 'characters', 'villains', 'very', 'least', 'buffoonish', 'one-dimensional', 'stock', 'characters', 'meant', 'ridicule', 'disdain', 'other', 'hand', 'extremist', 'religious', 'sects', 'actually', 'promote', 'practice', 'violence', 'are', 'often', 'ignored', 'given', 'sympathetic', 'depiction', 'SYRIANA', 'replaced', 'implausible', 'politically-correct', 'substitutes', 'case', 'remarkable', 'cowardice', 'craven', 'pandering', 'turned', 'adequate', 'though', 'highly', 'farfetched', 'book', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'inane', 'excrementally', 'insipid', 'film', 'SUM', 'ALL', 'FEARS.But', 'what', 'someone', 'could', 'make', 'decent', 'movie', 'Christians', 'good', 'people', 'AND', 'scary', 'well', 'had', 'not', 'heard', 'FRAILTY', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'film', 'had', 'reached', 'rental', 'market.In', 'spite', 'what', 'seemed', 'unflattering', 'stereotypically', 'caricatured', 'depiction', 'religious', 'Texan', 'folk', 'was', 'slightly', 'intrigued', 'storyline', 'thought', 'might', 'make', 'least', 'relatively', 'interesting', 'viewing', 'time', 'very', 'few', 'other', 'promising', 'alternatives', 'worth', 'renting.For', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'are', 'interested', 'FRAILTY', 'story', 'man', 'named', 'Meiks', 'Matthew', 'McCaugheney', 'who', 'have', 'knowledge', 'GOD', 'Hand', 'killer', 'serial', 'killer', '70', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'caught', 'even', 'identified', 'Meiks', 'alleged', 'information', 'authorities', 'particular', 'skeptical', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Powers', 'Booth', 'who', 'regards', 'Meiks', 'somewhat', 'unsettling', 'mystery', 'bulk', 'film', 'mainly', 'Meiks', 'recollection', 'events', 'past', 'current', 'presented', 'flashbacks', 'testimony', 'more', 'plot', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'away', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'think', 'very', 'highly', 'believe', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'unanimous', 'consensus', 'support', 'following', 'opinion', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'capable', 'effective', 'actor', 'perhaps', 'not', 'most', 'skilled', 'thespian', 'ever', 'appear', 'screen', 'Nonetheless', 'invariably', 'believable', 'character', 'roles', 'Where', 'even', 'greater', 'talent', 'skills', 'seem', 'lie', 'director', 'have', 'seen', 'two', 'films', 'FRAILTY', 'THE', 'GREATEST', 'GAME', 'EVER', 'PLAYED', 'directed', 'enjoyed', 'reason', 'watched', 'THE', 'GREATEST', 'GAME', 'EVER', 'PLAYED', 'was', 'how', 'impressed', 'was', 'FRAILTY', 'thought', 'were', 'skillfully', 'made', 'entertaining', 'represent', 'VERY', 'different', 'sensibilities', 'psyche', 'addition', 'finding', 'right', 'tone', 'energy', 'performance', 'level', 'actors', 'Paxton', 'also', 'talent', 'creative', 'effective', 'visuals', 'even', 'when', 'just', 'using', 'relatively', 'simple', 'techniques', 'film', 'not', 'rely', 'flashy', 'high-tech', 'effects', 'yet', 'still', 'effective', 'scenes', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'scene', 'FRAILTY', 'where', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'character', 'driving', 'barn', 'middle', 'countryside', 'fairly', 'simple', 'setting', 'premise', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'sequences', 'have', 'seen', 'movies', 'possibly', 'one', 'most', 'effective', 'compelling', 'goosebump-raiser', 'even', 'just', 'thinking', 'write', 'this.This', 'film', 'critics', 'detractors', 'addition', 'usual', 'coterie', 'obnoxious', 'loudmouths', 'who', 'unnecessarily', 'spew', 'hyperbole', 'exaggerated', 'pejoratives', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'conform', 'own', 'narrow', 'screed', 'fairness', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'are', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'film', 'own', 'valid', 'reasons', 'think', 'very', 'impressive', 'engaging', 'film', 'especially', 'considering', 'relatively', 'modest', 'budget', 'story', 'well-written', 'creative', 'as', 'well', 'capably', 'effectively', 'directed']",Frailty

You absolutely believed Anthony Hopkins was Hannibal Lector because Hopkins is superb in his chosen profession. I had not given Bill Paxton any particular due as an actor and the fault is mine. After seeing Frailty, though, I have come to the conclusion he has been really underrated. In Aliens I did believe in the whiney Marine. In Twister, the hunky weatherman. In Frailty I believed in the good father. In fact, I wished to myself I'd had a father like that about the time someone else in the room voiced the same opinion.The movie scenario depends on that belief. Paxton plays a single father raising two boys and the portrait he paints of a good, caring dad is absolute. One night he wakes up the boys to tell them his has receieved a vision from God telling him to kill demons in human form.  There we have the crux of the story: Has he truly had a vision or has he suddenly gone mad?  Son Fenton is confused and of the opinion that madness is the answer. Young son Adam believes and swears he shares the visions. Most will think the child is merely saying what he thinks his father wants to hear. When the killing begins Fenton is horrified and desperate to stop it.It actually begins with an adult Fenton (Matthew McConaughey) showing up to talk with Agent Doyle (Powers Boothe) about some recent serial killings and says it is his brother, Adam, committing them. Through a series of flashbacks he tells Doyle about his childhood, the killings, his own brutal imprisonment, and his father's madness which has been tranferred on to his little brother.This sleeper of a movie is very, very good. It keeps you wondering about truth and madness throughout. I'm sure it isn't flawless, but darned if I can find any fault in it. The child actors were great and Bill Paxton surprisingly perfect in his ""good father"" role.

710341,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B00006AUJR,Brian Driver,"[1, 1]","(Note: this review contains NO SPOILERS!)""Frailty"" is a truly unsettling film, a rare movie that questions the power of faith and religious devotion.  All too often, popular works raise issues like these, then fail to deliver the goods...but that's not true here.  And, as a result, we're left questioning not only what we've seen, but our own beliefs as well.And that's really it, after all, given any work of fiction: don't we always ask ourselves what we would do in such a situation?  Would we fight for what we believe, even flying in the face of danger?Here, however, we're not simply opposed by a big palooka with a big gun.  We're faced with our own faith, and the power of our belief -- in conflict with everything a rational person holds to be true.""Frailty"" is not afraid to ask the big questions, and one viewing will not be enough to answer them all.That this film is directed with conviction by actor Bill Paxton is relatively amazing.  Impressive as an actor (logging over 75 movies, he is probably best remembered for his ""Game over, man.  Game over!"" inAliens), he has done nothing of note as a director EXCEPT for this film...and what an extraordinary film it is.The movie begins with Matthew McConaughey's character Fenton Meiks coming into an FBI station in Dallas on a dreary, stormy night  with a mind-boggling confession to make: he has been part of a homicidal string of murders known as the ""God's Hand Killings,"" and needs to speak to lead investigator Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe).From here on in the film travels back in time to describe those killings, and to the role the young Meiks played in them...along with his younger brother Adam.  The two boys live with their father (Paxton), a widower whose wife died before movie began.  Their life is not idyllic, but comfortable; that is, until Dad rushes out to tell the boys that last night he received a vision from God, and he and the boys have been given a divine mission: to find ""demons"" and destroy them.While the impressionable Adam is quickly aboard with his father's quest, Fenton is disturbed when he finds out these ""demons"" look like ordinary men and women.  True, their father has their names on a list he says God gave him, but to Fenton their father's actions constitute murder, plain and simple.Soon, their father gathers his materials: the list, an axe (which he names Otis) and a pipe (for knocking out the demons), a pair of gloves--soon to be explained, and a pit they must dig beneath a shed, where their missions will be finalized, and their bodies are soon after buried in a  rose garden behind their house.The first mission goes off without a hitch...Dad comes home with a female ""demon"" whom he carries down to the pit, and when Dad takes off his gloves and places his hand upon her he is struck by a vision and ""sees"" her crimes, which are left undescribed to us, but he clearly finds them to be horrible.  Called upon also to touch her by their dad, Adam claims to see her deeds as well, but Fenton does not, and believes that his father is crazy, and Adam is brainwashed not only by his love for his father but also by his need to believe him.And thus the heart of the movie is laid bare:  are his dad's visions real?  Was he truly visited by one of God's angels, or has he gone crazy?  Is he truly smiting demons, or is he only committing murder?  Fenton clearly does not believe his father, and director Paxton intelligently does not allow us to see anything other than what he describes, leaving us to decide what we would do in Fenton's place.There is more to this movie...the plot makes some twists and turns that deliberately disorient us, and thus our own decisions are tested.

Now many people think that this movie is a horror movie. Well your wrong, it is a suspense (I would barely consider this a thriller) This movie is very easy to follow and yet it's still clever. One pro about this movie is that it throws you off. It messes with your mind and it also drives the fear into you of if you are or if you aren't a demon... I know what your thinking ""Demon what? This movie is going to suck!"" Well let me explain to you what it's about.When Fenton (Matthew McConaughey) comes to the FBI claiming that he knows about the god's hand killer. God's Hand Killer? Yes, God's Hand Killer. God gets the sense that there is demons on earth. So he sends an angel to talk to Fentons father and asks him, Fenton and Adam (Fentons little brother) to slay demons. A demon slayer if you will, well the father accepts being a religous man. So he tells his sons about it, Adams believes but Fenton thinks that his father has lost his mind. The demons are real people. So Fenton tries to tell the police, run away, and as his last resort he tells his father that he has seen the demons. So he is about to slay a demon when he turns and gives his father a heavy blow in the torso, but wait Adam is now the heir demon killer, so will he step up to the demon killing position.Back in the FBI office Fenton tells the chief, that he can show him where the bodies are buried. So they take a ride back to the graveyard where they buried the demon corpses. Then Fenton reveals something, an important little detail...This movie is very suspenseful, not scary and not that gorey. I feel that anyone that is up to it can watch it.

I do not ordinarily do well with films that are horror genre allied but this was the exception.  One big reason this film succeeds is that it has a story that catches hold of you and never lets go.  I found myself wondering what I would do if I were the son, Fenton, whose father embarked on an avenging angel serial killing quest and expected me to be his helper along with my smaller sibling.  There does seem to be a side issue too as to whether the father and the younger son actually have some psychic ability too so that they can actually see the &quot;crimes&quot; of their victims which make them &quot;demons&quot;.  That ultimately is left to your own viewer judgement, however.  The next big reason this film works is that the acting is first rate.  Paxton is superb as the father (and the film director) who is gripped by this apocalyptic vision and quest.  The two boys playing his sons are equally great as his followers, one willing and the other unwilling.  And Matthew McConnerghy and Powers Booth bring it all home as the adults years later who are left with the aftermath of the father's legacy.",5,Mesmerized Entire Time,1034553600,"10 14, 2002",2002,1177,"['was', 'absolutely', 'entire', 'time', 'film', 'played', 'do', 'not', 'ordinarily', 'do', 'well', 'films', 'are', 'horror', 'genre', 'allied', 'was', 'exception', 'One', 'big', 'reason', 'film', 'story', 'hold', 'never', 'lets', 'go', 'found', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'were', 'son', 'Fenton', 'father', 'embarked', 'avenging', 'angel', 'serial', 'killing', 'quest', 'expected', 'be', 'helper', 'smaller', 'sibling', 'seem', 'be', 'side', 'issue', 'too', 'father', 'younger', 'son', 'actually', 'have', 'psychic', 'ability', 'too', 'so', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'quot', 'crimes', 'quot', 'victims', 'make', 'quot', 'demons', 'quot', 'ultimately', 'left', 'own', 'viewer', 'judgement', 'however', 'next', 'big', 'reason', 'film', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'Paxton', 'superb', 'father', 'film', 'director', 'who', 'gripped', 'apocalyptic', 'vision', 'quest', 'two', 'boys', 'playing', 'sons', 'are', 'equally', 'great', 'followers', 'one', 'willing', 'other', 'unwilling', 'Matthew', 'McConnerghy', 'Powers', 'Booth', 'bring', 'home', 'adults', 'years', 'later', 'who', 'are', 'left', 'aftermath', 'father', 'legacy']",Frailty

But one night, perhaps a little early to bed, you have a vision from God.  This vision informs you that demons are walking the earth, and you and your two young sons are God's appointed demon slayers in these last days.  Not long after that, an angel with a flaming sword appears to you at work, and gives you a list of demons to slay.  The problem is that these demons inhabit the bodies of other ordinary human beings.  They look like people, not demons.  But you're not deterred from your mission for an instant.  Because you're doing God's work, and God must be obeyed.This is the plot of Frailty, starring Matthew McConaughey  and Bill Paxton.  The chilling part is that this sort of thing happens in real life; perhaps it's happening right now as you read this review-somewhere, someone believes they are driven by God to slay demons, demons that look like you and me, but the slayer can see that we're demons.  By the end of this movie, you will re-evaluate the plausibility of the story's premise, but trust me, father and son alike are as crazy as banshees.  Nowhere in God's Holy Bible does it say anything about human beings going forth to slay demons in the name of God.  But no matter.  Most serial killers don't care about that small detail anyway.I was left wondering how someone with such a normal and quiet life could suddenly become gripped by homicidal delusions, and be so assured in his mission that he'd subject his children to the most gruesome abuse.  Sadly, Frailty is a kind of American gothic, where ""serial killer"" is a household word and almost everyone lives in a town that has been turned into a media circus during a manhunt, a trial, or both.  It's the realism of Frailty that makes it so scary.  This isn't a splatter movie, but you know what happens.  The story is told effectively with a minimum of graphic violence.  You see it in your mind's eye, and that is enough.Thought-provoking, stick-to-your-ribs scariness.

Unlike those cheesy, slasher flicks that cause you to jump maybe once or twice in your seat, this movie presents a subtle horror that stays with you long after you have watched it.The movie is about a widowed man, played with fierce intensity by Bill Paxton, who wakes up in the middle of the night one night and has a vision. He believes God came to him and asked him to rid the world of evil demons aka humans by murdering them and that God would send him special weapons to do the task. The religious (insane?) man wants to fulfill God's will and asks his two sons to help him.The oldest son believes his father is crazy while the youngest boy is too little to believe anything different than what his father says is true. Skip to the future and the oldest son, now played by Matthew McConaughey, goes to a detective to tell him everything he knows about the murders.Flash backs and flash forwards help this unsettling tale unfold. The scariest part for me wasn't the murders themselves (which aren't really seen), its the fact that these boys' innocence was stripped from them and they watched helplessly as their father went on a mad murder spree.Also unsettling are the questions this movie raises about the father's sanity and God. Was the father really insane or was it really God's will for him to rid the world of those people? Does God seek out certain people to take out the bad seeds for him? If the man was insane and God didn't want him to kill those people, why did he find that mysterious axe and where did ""the list"" come from? Its questions like these that will leave you hanging and leave you feeling spooked.With great performances (what else would you expect from Bill or Matthew?), an incredible cast and an extremely spooky setting, this is the perfect scary movie to watch if you want to be scared out of your mind.The most gripping moment of the movie for me was how the father punishes one of his boys for telling the police sheriff about the murders. That scene will stay with me for days now and I'm sure I'll have nightmares about it too.For another deep thinking thriller that leaves you wth tons of chills, check out Identity with John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet and Clea Duvall.

Fenton Meiks claims that his brother, Adam, is the killer. Adam believes that demons are taking over the world, and he has to take them down. But there are too many, too many, and Adam, in anguish, kills himself. Fenton promised Adam, years ago, that he would take him to the ""Rose Garden"" when it was time, and tonight he stole an ambulance with Adam's body to do it.Through flashbacks, we learn that Adam is Fenton's younger brother, an angelic looking boy who enjoys singing Bible songs. They live behind the deserted Rose Garden, Fenton taking care of his brother because their mother died when Adam was born, and their father works hard as a mechanic. The three men make a picture-perfect home together.Until Dad has a vision from God.

That said, while Frailty gets off to a good (and chilling) start, I had problems with the premise and even bigger problems with the resolution. When the widower father of two young boys suddenly awakens with a mission to rid the world of demons, what ensues can only be viewed as horrific child abuse:  forcing two children not only to see their father commit axe murders but to participate in the disposal of the bodies cannot be dismissed by a surprise ending that's intended, somehow, to justify the beginning.I couldn't buy into a lone FBI agent going off alone with the McConaughy character, without any backup, without leaving any mention of his destination. It's a quantum hole in the plot that is very hard to buy, as is the notion that a man might come into possession of a (literally) god-given gift of seeing into the souls of people both good and bad. That ""gift"" which is the core thesis of the script cannot redeem the horror that is forced upon two innocent children. I was left with the unsettling idea that I'd been sold a justification package to excuse madness decorated to look like goodness.No amount of good acting, good editing, good cinematography can elevate this film above a gruesome reality that turns two little boys into adults who kill--for whatever reason. This is one seriously creepy movie--primarily because it attempts to offer validation for murder, as if it's okay for a possibly nutso dad to coerce his reluctant older son into participating in his ""vision.""

This is a violent film that shows you very little blood at all. Paxton wisely realizes that the grisliest horror often resides in our own heads, and uses that to full effect.Paxton, in his directorial debut, manages to tell a story that could have easily fallen flat if not given the right attention.

The first four fifths of the movie had me on edge and involved. Matt O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter who played the young boys are excellent, and so is Bill Paxton, who loved his sons and was committed to following God's message to capture and kill demons. The heart of the story isn't the horror of Mr. Meik's axe-wielding justice, but the horror of what his obsession does to his sons. Matthew McConaughey surprised me as one of the sons, now grown. There is no charm about him, just an uneasy matter-of-factness. He is very good. And for a movie which many might consider a horror film, there is almost no gore. Even the axe murders take place off camera. Throughout the movie, which is told almost all in flashback, the power of the story derives from the relationship between the two sons, who are about 10 and 8, and their widowed father. It's this dynamic which, I think, makes the movie so engrossing and unsettling.But then there is the last 20 minutes or so of the movie, when all the twists begin to happen, all the surprises flash at you, the irony of the truth happens. For me, it's just too much; it becomes unsatisfying because too many pieces, some without any preparation, are slammed into place. The basic twist, however, involving McConaughey is well set up and plays fair with the audience.

With that in mind, ""Frailty"", Bill Paxton's fine little nugget of terror in the American Heartland is a fine film that marks the actor's promising directorial debut, and a desperate, dark journey into the depths of religious hysteria and the implosion of what seems a picture-perfect American family.The movie is awe-inspiring, stunning, mystifying; it is so good that I'm not going to spoil any of its twists and turns, other than to say that Paxton's movie (with spare and well-paced writing by Brent Hanley) is a taut, nasty little homage to Alfred Hitchcock.The plot, very quickly (and spoiler free): the FBI have been hunting for the ""God's Hand Killer"", a West Texas axe murderer who has been terrorizing the region for two decades. The film, presented as what Hitchcock would have called a 'frame story', begins with Matthew McConaughey confessing to the startled Dallas FBI Agent Wesley Doyle, played succinctly by Powers Boothe. McConaughey, who plays Fenton Meiks, contends that his brother, Adam, is the killer the FBI is looking for.The movie then flashes back to Thurman, Texas in 1979, where Fenton and Adam (played remarkably by two awfully poised and very natural young actors, Matthew O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter)are growing up with their father (Bill Paxton), an affable auto mechanic and a good father, who wakes his sons in the middle of the night to tell them that he's had a vision from the Angel of the Lord. Paxton, whose acting is solid and discomfiting, announces to his startled boys that the End of Times is at hand, and the family has a new duty: to cast out demons masquerading as people.Paxton's new religious fervor don't come from the peaceful New Testament side of Christianity, either: new 'visions' follow in rapid succession, and Paxton brings home some grisly new tools the family of ""Holy Superheroes"" will need to carry out their new mission against the forces of Evil, including an axe named Otis. As might be expected, bloodshed and horror (though not gory horror; this is not meant to be a splatter film, and the camera averts its eye during the more horrific sequences).What follows in the next hour and a half is an taut and astonishing suspense thriller in which the audience naturally empathizes with the plight of young Fenton Meeks: what do you do when you're 10 years old and your beloved father (and only parent) goes stark raving mad? Even better is the growing rift between older brother Fenton and the rest of the family; as Paxton's character drifts further into religious madness and blood frenzy, youngest son Adam embarks with him into credulity and a kind of idol-worship.The cinematography (by Bill Butler, who worked on both ""Jaws"" and ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"") is stark and haunting; Paxton uses the sere, flat, barren California landscape to telling effect, and the sequence in which Paxton finds 'Otis' is haunting and eerie. The acting here is also solid; Paxton portrays his religious zealot with an unnerving practicality and steadiness, McConaughey turns into a fine performance in which he gets to use his native Texas accent, and the two child actors lend strength and vitality to a film that would have been lost without good child leads.

710363,A3DS2FN4F9UV02,B00006AUJR,"Delgado ""A. Delgado""","[3, 5]","SPOILER ALERT!(This review contains spoilers so don't read this unless you've already made the smart choice of watching this incredible film!)First things first:  I'm a horror and thriller film junkie -- if it's part of either genre, chances are I've seen it.  ""Frailty"" holds the top spot on my list, hands down.Matthew McConaughey walks into an FBI office, after-hours on a rainy night, asking to speak to the agent in charge of the God's Hand serial killer case.  (With Powers Boothe playing the agent, it's a joy watching these two commanding actors in a simple head-to-head exchange.)  McConaughey identifies himself as Fenton Meeks and rather matter-of-factly informs Boothe that his younger brother, Adam Meeks, is the God's Hand killer, something that all began with their father (Bill Paxton), the original God's Hand killer.  Intrigued, Boothe listens to McConaughey's story and the film kicks in, with McConaughey as the narrator, taking the audience back to the 1970's and a small Texan town (props to the set designers for the beautifully shot scenes and set design -- very minimalist yet evocative):  Bill Paxton (who both stars as the dad AND does a BRILLIANT job in his directorial debut) is a hard-working automotive mechanic and widowed single dad, happily raising his two healthy, well-adjusted boys, Fenton and Adam.  All is well in the Meeks household, until dad suddenly informs the boys one night that he has received a vision from an Angel.  The mission?  As part of the war between Good and Evil, there are demons that must be destroyed and it's Dad's mission to do it, who has been assigned a small role in this war.  The crux?  The demons are in human form.  Uh-oh.  Dad was told he will receive the names, and weapons, to carry out his God-given task.  Adam, the younger boy, eagerly jumps on the ""superhero"" bandwagon while Fenton, the eldest, is understandably thinking: ""Dad's lost his marbles.""  We the audience, of course, empathize (as we are expected to) with rational Fenton.  As Dad reluctantly but somberly seeks out and executes several of the demons one by one, Fenton resists -- to us, the audience, Fenton is the sole voice of reason against his fanatic, seemingly-insane father and his all-too-naive little brother.***SPOILER ALERT***:  The twist???  (and this is what makes this film one-notch above sheer brilliance) Dear ol' Dad wasn't insane after all.  And McConaughey isn't Fenton but rather Adam Meeks.  The seeming ""victims"" Dad and Adam eliminated (we later learn in quick flashbacks what Dad and Adam could see upon touching their victims before executing them) were indeed demons: a child molester, a matricidal murderer, etc.  OK, well, we the audience wonder, ""maybe these insights were a product their insane minds?""  Nope.  In one of the last scenes, with the FBI agents feverishly reviewing every tape to identify the man who walked into the office (McConaughey), the tapes are all inexplicably blurry on facial recognition.  Indeed, seems McConaughey was right when he confidently proclaimed: ""God will protect me"" (in my mission).So what makes ""Frailty"" so genius?  Setting aside how one feels about its premise/conclusion, it is incontrovertibly UNIQUE.  In 95% of Hollywood films of the past 25+ years, the supernatural is ridiculed, always giving way at the end to a revelation in favor of the 'rational' and scientific answer.  The ""witch"" is always simply a victim of hysteria, the religious are always mere fanatics proven wrong by the time we walk out of the theatre, the medieval Crusader is always broken, cynical, and disillusioned.  ""Frailty"" has the chutzpah to actually posit the idea that, hey, maybe there ARE supernatural forces out there.  Maybe there ARE demons and angels?  Maybe there ARE people who are, perhaps not demons themselves but influenced by demons at certain points in their lives?Those who are hostile to religion and easily offended by the notion that there is Good and Evil on earth will, of course, hate the film for that very reason.  But those who aren't religious yet are good sports and have an open mind / enjoy a good thriller, will be able to appreciate the film, if only for its provocative and original conclusion.  And those who are religious, across every spectrum and denomination, mild or extreme, will be grateful for a film that finally presents the supernatural's existence as a possibility.You know those films you watch with someone and can't stop talking about and analyzing it for hours after?  This is one of those.

Von Behren ""reneofc""","[6, 7]","Halfway through this movie, I found myself so disheartened by the zealously horrific activities of a Texas father seen through the eyes of his two young sons, that I wondered why I had rented this video in the first place.  However, as the final moments of the denouement played out on my screen, I breathed a sigh of complete enjoyment and immense satisfaction.Bill Paxton portrays the older Meiks with the confused yet calm grounding of a man who believes himself appointed by God to rid the world of some of its less savory characters.  The unformed sensibilities of Adam and Fenton, his two elementary-school-age sons, diversely emblemize the two states of Paxton's befuddled mind. While one becomes a true believer, the other struggles adequately between what his conscience tells him is right and what he knows he cannot deny: his unconditional love for his father.The film is a story within a story, Matthew McConaughey relates the tale of his bizarre childhood to an FBI agent portrayed by Powers Boothe amidst the backdrop of a present day investigation of a serial killer's rampage known as &quot;the Hand of God&quot; killings.  As McConaughey's narrative reveals more and more of his father's incensed mission, Boothe's suspicions are aroused and challenged.  The audience can almost hear his mind ticking with questions as to why McConaughey has appeared in the first place. When he aggressively attempts to trap McConaughey into making a full confession of the crimes, the absolute truth of the film is disclosed with chilling clarity.Paxton's performance is great; he plays parent and vigilante with utter seriousness while giving new meaning to questions like 'what do people do way out here in the boonies?&quot;  The cricket-chirping country ambiance adds that frightening &quot;I'm-in-over-my-head&quot; feeling the cityslicker gets when trespassing on unknown territory where there isn't a Starbucks on every corner.  The setting, character, tone and dialogue all cleverly aid in supporting the audiences' already convinced attitudes about what is right and wrong and than masterfully acts as a buttress for just the opposite.

What dark secrets could they be hiding?  Bill Paxton plays the widowed father of two boys, portrayed handsomely by Matt O'leary and Jeremy Sumpter.  One night he comes into their bedroom to tell them an angel has visited him and that it is God's will that they destroy the demons inhabiting our world; but those demons look and act just like normal people.  Thus the creepiness of this unfortunately realistic yarn unfolds amid great mood lighting, solid acting, and surprisingly excellent direction from none other than Bill Paxton.  This is an auspicious debut for him and I for one hope he continues to be this inspired with any future attempts.  The suspense and tension are so eerie at times that the scene brings about bona-fide chills.  Matthew McConaughey, not a usual favorite actor of mine, is actually quite good in his scenes with Powers Booth, an actor who draws your attention with each calculated phrase.  The plot twist at the end is both good and bad.  It is good because it made me want to see the film all over again and try to catch what I know I missed; but it's bad because during the entire film I was seeing the movie from the eyes of Matt O'Leary's character when all of a sudden the rug is yanked out and I was forced to re-evaluate the entire movie in a span of about 5-10 minutes. However, this is a well made film with many unnerving moments, and is easy to recommend.  The screenwriter said something that was especially creepy.  I'm paraphrasing: The scariest thing about religious fanaticism is...what if it's true?  The used copies are unusually cheap here, as well, making this a supreme bargain.

We know early on that this is going to be a battle between good and evil, but the tricky part is, you don't know which person is which.Is the dad the good guy here, acting as a messenger for God?  Or is he the bad guy who's using religion to justify murder?Is the son really the perpetrator here...or the victim?This movie definitely messes with you.  Having the possibility where a child might have to be killed is a tricky plot to have in a story.  I've no doubt many people will be bothered by this....especially because of how the child is portrayed throughout the movie.  It's not like you have a clearcut evil villain here, like Damian in the movie, ""The Omen""...but instead have a scared little boy.  Watching this movie made my motherly instincts kick in and I wanted to protect him!  By the way, I thought the acting job by the oldest son was exceptional.  The other cast members performed well, too.There's a plot twist at the end that's very shocking and very entertaining...but also a little confusing, too.  I mean, I finally understood who was who, but I didn't understand why there was a switch in characters in the first place (I'm trying not to give away the ending).Anyway, there's not much more to say without giving away the great plot twist.

Meiks tells about his father, a loving father but religious zealot (Bill Paxton, for whom this film is also his directorial debut) who claims to have been commanded by God to kill ""demons"" living among them. He enlists his two young, impressionable sons to help him in this pursuit. The younger son follows along and believes in everything the father says, while the older son questions his father and attempts even to stymie his apparently delusional plans. The story takes various twists and turns before revealing its true nature and its interesting twist. Throughout the tale, the viewer feels such a great amount of sympathy for the older son, struggling against the helpless feeling he has under the increasingly more zealous and seemingly insane regime of his father.The tone of the film is dark, and the viewer will think s/he has made up his mind about the outcome but will be surprised. I did not expect much from this film, actually, so I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did. I like films with a slight twist, with emotional turmoil and genuine suspense, and this film provides all of the above along with excellent performances from Paxton, McConnaughey, and the two young boys who play the younger versions of the Meiks boys.

710375,AQMZ9N7NAIPC,B00006AUJR,"E. Selvia ""Liz""","[4, 17]","I have watched this film twice now, though ironically not because I thought it was great but because I could not believe how disappointed it left me. The beginning is fairly believable (free of spoilers) and builds up fairly interestingly but as the tale stretches on, it's difficult to understand exactly who Bill Paxton's target audience is. (spoiler alert) Are we really to believe that you can decide that someone is a ""demon"" from a few (supposed) snippets of a person's life? Doesn't circumstantial evidence or possible mental instability come into play at any point? You would have to be someone of either very low intelligence or very poorly educated to believe that those targeted by the killer are ""evil"". That said, towards the end, we are shown short scenes which supposedly prove that those targeted by the dad are ""demons"" but essentially, what we see are the usual cross-section of individuals targeted by religious fanatics in the news as ""evil"" (people who ""kill babies"", people who dare to have sex for reasons other than procreation, guys who live at home with their moms rather than follow the whole ""wife and two kids in the suburbs"" ritual of adulthood, etc. etc, etc,) Are you bored yet? I know I was. I was really hoping to get an interesting mystery about what it's like to have to live with mentally unstable parents but instead what I wound up with was an hour and a half, Christian conservative propaganda film justifying the vilification, judgement (and murder) of human beings whose lives and personal choices we do not agree with. Scary stuff indeed, but not for the reasons intended by Bill Paxton to be sure. The interesting thing I've learned here today, is that apparently dumb, rednecks now can make blockbuster films in place of thoughtful, well-educated worldly individuals. Yeesh! Bill Paxton really should stick to acting because writing (and directing) really aren't his forte. Feeling slightly ill now so I think I'll go watch something by Francois Trauffaut or maybe Akira Kurosawa.

710381,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B00006AUJR,General Zombie,"[5, 6]","""Frailty"" was quite critically acclaimed, but it doesn't seem quite as popular among horror fans as it seems like it ought to be.  Some of them will tell you, no doubt, that ""Frailty"" isn't a horror movie and while they're free to have their position, I feel that ""Frailty"" represents everything that horror should be.  Some will tell you that something isn't *really* horror unless it has a lot of traditional scare scenes and whatnot, and while ""Frailty"" isn't scary in the conventional sense it's definitely one of the most unsettling movies of the last decade.  It's short on action, for sure, but the general mood and the bleak ideas found in this movie can match up well against just about anything.The film opens as Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) arrives at FBI headquarters to find Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey waiting for him in his office.  Meiks has some exciting news:  His brother, Adam, is the God's Hand killer is, who is responsible for a half a dozen or so disappearances and who claims to be acting as, well, God's Hand.  Doyle is understandably skeptical, so Fenton launches into a disturbing tale of his childhood:  When Fenton (Matt O'Leary) is about 10 and his brother Adam (Jeremy Sumpter) a few years younger, their single father (Bill Paxton) has a peculiar vision:  Late at night an angel comes to him and tells him that the final days are at hand, that demons have released on the earth, and that Meiks family has been charged with the duty of fighting them.  These demons, however, aren't beasts or monsters, but look just like ordinary humans.  The young Adam takes these proclamations mildly, but Fenton is far more skeptical, and is, reasonably,  convinced that these demons appear human because that's all that they are.  Fenton wants to run away, but he doesn't really want abandon his father and he absolutely doesn't want to leave trusting Adam behind.  The rest of the film focuses largely on Fenton's struggle to pacify this mad situation, somehow.""Frailty"" is the quintessential psychological horror film.  Most of the time the protagonists of the film aren't in much physical danger, but the mental trauma that Fenton undergoes is almost beyond belief.  We don't see much of Dad before the vision, but we see enough to know that he's a good man and quite an ideal father.  He's still the same man after the vision, in fact, apart from the fact that he occasionally drives off late at night, and returns home with some stranger bound and gagged and takes them to the shed out back, where the rusty ax waits.  Though we learn the basics of the situation pretty quickly, first-time director and long-time actor Bill Paxton draws out the exposition, slowly building to the first horrific murder and the turmoil that follows in the wake of Dad's spree.  The film proves quite chilling before anything really happens, largely because of the disturbing, calm way that Dad discusses the mad plan, the sheer horror of the whole situation and in the cool, distant visual style of the film.  Horror movies are often garish and overblown, but ""Frailty"" takes the opposite tack, focusing on the dull, hot light of Texas and the yellowish tones that dominate landscape, giving the whole film a sense of reality that is often lacking in other films.  This method makes the few more stylized visuals all the more effective, like in the great scene where Dad realizes that his sacred weapon is found in a lonely  barn which has an unearthly shaft of light pointing down towards it from the sky and through the cracks in the walls.  The murder scenes are uniformly nerve-wracking, even if they aren't graphic. (This film is probably rated R for it's themes and a bit of profanity, not for what you actually see.)  How affecting this movie is is probably based to some degree on how you got along with your parents.  If your father was indifferent or not around perhaps this won't effect as much, but for someone who always was close to their Dad it can be a pretty disturbing concept.  Or, it is for me, anyway.""Frailty"" has a small cast, and they're all capable.  You always gotta worry about kids in horror movies, but O'Leary and Sumpter both do a fine job.  O'Leary has the much meatier role, and he's very believable and identifiable, and McConaughey is good as the adult Fenton.  He's considered something of a lightweight actor, but he fits into the bleak story nicely, and what can I say, I like the guy.  Paxton is excellent as the father as well, and gives a truly unnerving performance.  On the downside, Boothe's FBI Agent is something of of a clich&eacute;, but that's okay, he's mostly just a plot device, he doesn't really do much of anything in the story.  He is what he is effectively enough, anyway.The film is fairly slow-moving, but it really comes to life at the end, where Fenton's struggles against his father become more open and dangerous all while their are some surprising developments in the current timeline.  There are some significant revelations in the final act, and I must admit that I didn't see the big one coming.  Probably lots of people will, but it pretty well blindsided me.  I think it's great, and the film all wraps up quite nicely in the end.  I'm not saying there aren't a few implausibilities and loose ends, but these things are inevitable in this kinda movie, and ""Frailty"" pulls this off a lot better than most.Hmm, that's it.  ""Frailty"" is just a great, very creepy, very nasty horror movie.  Check it out if you want some mature, serious horror.  Let's hope Paxton and Hanley each get around to making some more horror stuff someday soon.Grade: A-SPOILER ALERT:  On a closing note, I think it's hilarious how so many film critics refuse to accept the import of the ending, and pretend that it's ambiguous.  Did these people think that Bruce Willis wasn't really a ghost at the end of The Sixth Sense too?  God.  I guess they were just too enamored with the anti-fanatic commentary that they couldn't accept it when they found out they were watching a horror movie all along, a horror movie with no message whatsoever. (According to writer Hanley, anyway, and I'd say he has the final word on that.)  It's funny to listen to his commentary, he seems baffled and a little angry at the way people refused to accept it for what it is.  But anyway. . .",5,Outstanding,1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,6329,"['Frailty', 'was', 'quite', 'critically', 'acclaimed', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'popular', 'horror', 'fans', 'ought', 'be', 'will',

Frailty unfolds like a beautiful origami of horror as the movie moves seamlessly between past and present and in one moment of true cinema magic - simultaneously.  Bill Paxton directs himself in his greatest role, a widower raising two young sons alone who receives a message from God that it is up to him and his boys to seek and destroy the demons on earth posing as humans.  In the present we have Matthew McConaughey as one of the sons - now grown - ""assisting"" FBI Agent Powers Booth in uncovering the infamous ""Hand of God"" murders.Where ""Frailty"" differs from other religious fanatical type horror stories is that - for once there is a believability factor . . . as an audience member I was incredibly uncomfortable having to make  the decision of whether or not this was real.  Paxton's performance is raw in its honesty and total in commitment of the young father.  He is so loving and caring a parent that when he takes up the burden of killing it is disturbingly real.Paxton also proves to be a great storyteller and his work with the two boys that play his sons pays off in spades.Frailty is a jolting, emotional roller coaster ride into hell that will leave you breathless and sleepless.",5,A Roller Coast Ride to Hell and Back,1104364800,"12 30, 2004",2004,1232,"['What', 'punch', 'movie', 'Frailty', 'beautiful', 'origami', 'horror', 'movie', 'seamlessly', 'past', 'present', 'one', 'moment', 'true', 'cinema', 'magic', 'simultaneously', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'greatest', 'role', 'widower', 'raising', 'two', 'young', 'sons', 'alone', 'who', 'message', 'God', 'up', 'boys', 'seek', 'destroy', 'demons', 'earth', 'posing', 'humans', 'present', 'have', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'one', 'sons', 'now', 'grown', 'assisting', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Powers', 'Booth', 'uncovering', 'infamous', 'Hand', 'God', 'murders.Where', 'Frailty', 'differs', 'other', 'religious', 'fanatical', 'type', 'horror', 'stories', 'once', 'believability', 'factor', 'audience', 'member', 'was', 'incredibly', 'uncomfortable', 'having', 'make', 'decision', 'not', 'was', 'real', 'Paxton', 'performance', 'raw', 'honesty', 'total', 'commitment', 'young', 'father', 'so', 'loving', 'caring', 'parent', 'when', 'up', 'burden', 'killing', 'disturbingly', 'real.Paxton', 'also', 'be', 'great', 'storyteller', 'work', 'two', 'boys', 'play', 'sons', 'spades.Frailty', 'jolting', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'hell', 'will', 'leave', 'breathless', 'sleepless']",Frailty

Seriously have no idea why since my connection on the amazon player said I was green the whole time.  Regardless, I finally finished it and it is THAT good that even with the inconveniences of a crappy stream, this movie was unbelievable.***SPOILER ALERT***First of all it is FULL of twists and turns.  Some I saw coming.  Others I totally got blown away by.  Frailty is difficult to label.  Is it horror?  Some parts about it, like the blind faith and brainwashing clearly could scare any sane person.  Or how about the fact that it wasn't impossible to sympathize with the father.  Other parts of the movie are more of a mystery/suspense story being played out by the narrators memories.  I was always thinking during this movie and appreciating the characters and the plot.Bill Paxton is incredible as an average widower raising 2 kids who suddenly begins having visions which to his older son look suspiciously like the ravings of a madman.  Matthew Mc-whatever is surprisingly clever and enjoyable as his adult son who relives his past in a confession to the FBI.  The rest of the cast was great though I didnt notice any other big names just actors that were vaguely familiar (like Sal from Deadwood as the FBI agent).I liked how the movie constantly was pulled between the fathers faith and proof (like always just knowing where to go to find his demons) and Fenton's skepticism and facts and up until the very end the viewer is never really sure which is right.  I was extremely entertained during the entirety of the story.  Im a huge fan of Bill Paxton and seeing this I understand how he got cast for HBO's Big Love, another favorite of mine.Overall, I rated this movie 5 stars.

710384,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00006AUJR,Grady Harp,"[0, 1]","FRAILTY escaped audience attention when in the theaters, probably because of the critical scrutiny of the fundamentalist religious Right, the content of the story line, and the overall repulsion of the story.  But it is these very excuses that make this film exceptional in quality when it is viewed in the privacy of the home on DVD.  The story relates the thin line between sanity and insanity, between faith and the over-the-edge messages from the messengers of God about the encroaching Millennium, and the viscerally tough distinction between parent/child love and induction of madness.  Blessed with a fine ensemble cast that includes actor/director Bill Paxton in an amazingly understated role of a man mired progressively deeper into insanity, Matthew McConaughey as the narrator of this twisted tale of multiple murders, Powers Booth as the FBI agent investigating the confession of McConaughey's character, and excellent young actors in the pivotal roles of the victimized sons.  Paxton and his lighting director and editor have elected to keep a suffocatingly bland surface on which to paint this macabre tale, a technique which leads the viewer to be more sympathetic to the range of the characters affected by this God's Hand trail of mayhem.  The murders are graphic only in the eyes of the victims and the perpetrators which increases the grisly effect of what is being done before our eyes.  The only flaws in this fine little film are the somewhat wooden script and the over the edge musical score that is unrelenting in its morbid atmosphere.

710385,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B00006AUJR,Gregor von Kallahann,"[0, 4]","It might seem that a movie like FRAILTY owes its very existence to the succes of THE SIXTH SENSE and a subsequent renewed interest in surprise plot twists--the kind that make you go ""Wha'??"" and resolve to see the film again and again.  Actually, given the timing of its release, it seems just as likely that FRAILTY was already ""greenlighted"" by the time the former film had taken the movie-going world by a storm.  Still its creators could only hope that they had stumbled onto an emerging trend--at the very least--and await a similar audience  reaction.It didn't happen, of course.  It could be because the film is ultimately a lot grimmer than SIXTH SENSE.  As others have pointed out,below and elsewhere, the movie does not actually show a lot of blood and gore (thankfully, because more than enough is implied).  But this is the kind of film that begs to be labled ""disturbing"" by reviewers everywhere.  It's an apt term in this case. I left this film wondering if its producers could be cited for child abuse.  I figured there's almost no way that the child actors involved could not have been unduly traumatized.Having said all that, I will add that this is a pretty effective suspense film.  Like the reviewer above, I find its ending more ambiguous than some reviewers.  But to say much more risks having to put a spoiler warning in my review's title.  In fact, I suspect that most of the reviews posted below should bear such a warning.This is an intriguing film--very well acted, and directed.

710388,A38KB16DRKI8QW,B00006AUJR,High Duke,"[3, 5]","Frailty is a movie that I only heard a little bit about when it first came out, all positive stuff, but it quickly dissappeared from theatres before I could get around to seeing it. I caught it on the movie channel one night and was captivated by it right away. Matthew McConaughey stars as a guy who goes to the FBI to report on his brother, who is a serial killer running rampant, but McConaughey wants to explain what brought about this manifestation of evil in his brother. The story is told in flashback, where Bill Paxson plays the father of two boys who has a 'vision from God' one day and becomes one of his Archangel defenders on Earth. So, he goes about killing people he believes are demons. One of the boys isn't convinced however, while the other claims that he can see the demons just like his father. The film chronicles the family's descent into madness and fanaticism. What makes the film really clever and well put together is the final 20 minutes, which comes out of left field and leaves us with a very un-Hollywood ending. I don't agree with the final 'message' of the film, but it made it that much scarier in the end. Matthew McConaughey was quite good in this flick, actually he's always pretty good in offbeat little films...it's when he's doing Hollywood-leading man type stuff where he comes across as cocky and arrogant, rather than laid-back and charming. Bill Paxson has always been great as these down-home Southern characters and his portrayal is great at exposing the dualities of man...from loving, doting father to merciless 'Angel' of vengeance. And Powers Boothe really should be a bigger star. He's always been supremely underrated and is a master at conveying authoriatarian menace. A lot of people are claiming this film to be a tool of the Religious Right, but I don't buy that at all. There's all this talk of conspiracy, like the Moral Majority somehow is duping us into watching what we 'think' is a conventional thriller but is really their 'wicked propaganda' in disguise. Ooooooo....scary! Now, I'm not a religious guy at all, but I took the ending for what it is, open-ended and ripe for many interpretations...usually a sign of a great film, no? Hell, I'm sure a lot of religious people will get upset with this movie and say that it's left-wing propaganda because it portrays Christians as axe-wielding fanatics, no? Man, someone even went so far as to claim this is a pro-death penalty movie and how its no coincidence that all three of the male leads are from Texas. Ridiculous! I didn't get the impression that the film was pro death penalty at all. It's unfortunate that when a movie presents an idea that you may be uncomfortable with, so many people cry out against its message and declare it 'propaganda' for the OTHER side, and the Left and the Right as equally as guilty in this regard. This was a great tale of Southern Gothic horror, and let's not forget that there's an element of 'fantasy' here that asks you to suspend your disbelief. For me, the ending is at the same level of sophistication as the 'What If?' comics that Marvel put out in the 70s. And that is NOT a put-down of the film, but let's remember one thing, it's a HORROR film for God's sakes! I certainly didn't view it for lessons in personal morality. I thought it great that someone could look at the ending anyway they want to. It demands that you use your own intelligence, that you make up your own mind. What amazes me is that some of the lefties reviewing the film out there, people from whom I expect a MODICUM of intelligence, totally misinterpret the movie and overpoliticize it. The so-called 'demons' in the flick aren't athiests you dummies! All of them committed heinous crimes, which I think we'd all agree weren't 'good' things, no matter what your political leanings are. As well, how can you say the ending wasn't effective, when that SAME ending is what prompted you to take keyboard in hand to decry the film? Or the guy calling it unethical? Because the person he wants punished isn't? And I dont see where the film was a rip-off of the Dead Zone, nor how that film had a GOOD message and this one had a BAD one. Ha ha, you guys are a pathetic joke. Sooooo predictable, sooooo lame.

And seeing the rave reviews on the cover, 2 good actors, and an intriguing plot made me get it.I then watched it when I got home and loved it. The movie is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. Bill Paxton and Matthew McConnaughey are great and the twist at the end was great.The plot of the movie is very good and unique and thought provoking. The movie is about Bil Paxton and his two children, Adam and Fenton. Life is fine for them until Paxton starts seeing visions from God. God tells him that his children and him hve been chosen to kill demons, under human form. From then Paxton receives the weapons he must use, and the list of the people that he must kill. Fenton is shocked and terrified when his father starts bringing demons home and killing them. Adam claims that he also can see that they're demons. Adam and his father are a team. But Fenton knows that he is killing real people. What is so interesting is when Paxton touches the demons with his bare hands. He then sees their sins. Adam sees them also but not Fenton. The movie is thought provoking because you wonder whether or not Paxton is nuts or whether this is true. And when a killer like Paxton reappears, Fenton thinks that he knows who it is and tells the detective assigned the case his story. But, then, you're in for one hell of an awesome plot twist. The movie is excellent and is possibly my favorite movie of all time. Bill Paxton does a great job acting but also does an umbelievable directorial debut.This is a remarquble film and everyone should see it. And for such a low price, wow.

It is the directorial debut of Bill Paxton.  Yes, he is the same Bill Paxton of films like Wierd Science, Apollo 13, Twister, Tombstone, and Titanic, among many others.  And is it an amazing film to say the least.This has to be one of the best, if not the best, directorial debut's in recent memory.  It stars the up and coming star at the time Matthew McConaughey, Powers Boothe, Bill Paxton as Dad, Jeremie Sumpter as Young Adam, and the most amazing performance by a newcomer I have ever seen Matt O'Leary as Young Fenton.The story is told through McConaughey's eyes in flashback format and the whole movie takes place during a long car ride. (One of the best scenes ever filmed of a car that NEVER MOVED on set.  Amazing.)It is a story about the ""God's Hand"" killer.  Fenton, played by McConaughey, walks in one stormy night to FBI headquarters and tells Boothe (the lead FBI agent assigned to the God's Hand case) that he knows who the killer is.  It is his brother Adam.  Then the story begins and it completely sucks you in.  It has a really eerie Gothic feel to it.  The way that Paxton weaves the story is amazing.  You would think this film was directed by a seasoned veteran.  Also, One of the best things about this film is that most of the violence of the film happens off camera.  It isn't a movie that needs to be gory.  It is scary in the subject matter.  It doesn't need gore to get under your skin.  And believe me, it will get under there.I will give none of the essential plot away because it is TOO good to spoil.  I will say this though.

The story is narrated by Matthew McConaughey.  McConaughey plays Fenton Meeks, a man who went to the FBI with the information that he knows who the God's Hand killer is.  Fenton tells the FBI agent that the killer is, in fact,  Fenton's brother.  However, to convince the agent, Fenton has to slowly tell the family history of how this would have come to be.Fenton tells of his family, a widower and his two sons.  Everything is normal until the father wakes the two boys up in the middle of the night and tells them that he just had a vision from God.  The vision told him that there are demons walking around, and the Meeks family has been chosen by God to destroy the demons.  Sounds kind of whacked out, huh?  The movie presents this straightforward, with the only doubting coming from a young Fenton (though the comprise the bulk of the movie, these are flashback scenes).Fenton tells the story to the FBI agent as they drive to where the bodies are buried.  It is a creepy story, but a very compelling one to watch.  Like any good horror movie, there is a twist, but how much you anticipate it depends on how perceptive you are.  There is a second deeper twist beyond the obvious that you might expect.This is a well crafted first movie directed by Bill Paxton (who also stars as Fenton's father), and is worth watching without question.

Meiks makes the matter-of-fact statement that he knows who the killer is - his younger brother Adam. Or rather ""was"", as Adam committed suicide some hours earlier. As a matter of fact, Adam's body is in the stolen ambulance parked just outside. Fenton goes on to tell Doyle (and the audience via flashbacks) that the killing spree started many years before when he and his brother were pre-teenagers. One night in the small hours, their Dad (Bill Paxton), by day a soft spoken auto mechanic, awakens them to announce that he's had a vision of God, who's given them a special mission - to kill demons. Soon, the Almighty provides the tools - a pair of work gloves, a length of metal pipe, and a double-bladed axe named ""Otis"" - and a list with the names of the first seven targets, all of whom are strangers. Adam buys into the concept, but Fenton has to be coerced into doing his part. Soon the axe starts to fall on very real human necks. Back in the present, Fenton tells Wesley that he knows where the case's missing bodies are buried. Does he want to go and see?FRAILTY is a gripping story about that sort of obsession which compels otherwise normal people into committing horrific acts. Matthew O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter are excellent as the young Fenton and Adam respectively, and Paxton, who also directed, is chilling as the loving father who conscripts his sons into the Lord's army.There were times when I thought FRAILTY verged on the improbable, but then said to myself, ""Well, after all, it's rural Texas"", and went with the flow. And because of a completely unexpected twist at the end, it's one of those rare films that my wife and I verbally re-ran to clarify in our minds what we just saw. This fact ranks it an intellectual step above most thrillers released to the Big Screen.Were the victims of the Meiks trio really just normal folks like you or me? Why was the adult Fenton so pre-occupied with the photo of Agent Doyle and his mother on the former's desk? And who messed with the Bureau's surveillance cameras?

The story of the movie develops as McConaughey tells the FBI agent how his little family fell apart when his father (Bill Paxton, in one of his best performances) received the visit of an angel, 20 years ago, and this angel gives his father weapons and a list of ""demons"" that must be slain.Of course, there's much more than this in the story, but I don't want to give anything away.Paxton's first time direction is surprisingly competent and strong, although simple. The movie was shot in only 37 days. The visual is also very simple, but effective. Paxton is able o manipulate the audience, showing in the screen only what is needed to understand the movie. There are lots of violent scenes, but only once we are shown blood.I felt this thriller's story was a mix of a Stephen King's book  (""Bag of bones"", for example) with similarities to movies like ""Seven"". In the last five minutes, the dozens of plot twists may be confusing, but I was able to understand all what was happening because of the good edition and script of the movie.In the end, there are lots of subliminar implications that made me think about the motives and reasons for the serial killings. I was also impressed by the children's performances, and that is a hard thing to accomplish if you're a first-time director.""Frailty"" is the simple kind of movie that is hard to forget because of its strong presence. Another movie I could say the same thing about, although in the sci-fi genre, is ""Event Horizon"".

710410,AJNW2SVETWAW1,B00006AUJR,kacunnin,"[1, 2]","FRAILTY (2001) reminded me a lot of the TV series &#8220;Grimm&#8221; &#8211; but with a backdrop of religion instead of fairy tales.  The story is told by Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey), who goes to FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Booth) with information on a serial killer called the &#8220;Hand of God.&#8221;  The killer, says Fenton, is actually his younger brother Adam, who has just committed suicide.  The rest of the film is then Fenton&#8217;s flashback story about his father (Bill Paxton), a religious fanatic who believed he had been visited by an angel who ordered him to destroy the demons hiding among us.  As Fenton explains it, both he and young Adam were enlisted by crazy Dad to help him round up and kill a number of ordinary-looking people, chopping them up and burying them in a rose garden.  So is it any wonder poor Adam turned out to be a serial killer, just like dear old Dad?It&#8217;s fairly obvious in the first half of the film that Fenton&#8217;s father is insane.  The horror &#8211; and it&#8217;s definitely horrifying &#8211; is in Fenton&#8217;s predicament.  Paxton is very convincing as a lunatic assassin, wielding an axe he believes has been handed to him by an angel of God.  And Matt O'Leary, who plays Fenton as a child, is totally believable as a boy torn apart by his father&#8217;s insanity.  Should he assist his father in his deranged activities, or should he risk his father&#8217;s vengeance by turning against him?  It&#8217;s not an easy dilemma.Unfortunately, there is a major twist in FRAILTY that undermines Fenton&#8217;s story.  Because a deranged religious fanatic is only a monster if he&#8217;s truly insane.  If he isn&#8217;t, then he's really a hero, right?  At the start of this review, I compared FRAILTY to &#8220;Grimm,&#8221; a television series focusing on a different sort of &#8220;demon hunter.&#8221;  In the series, Nick Burkhardt (David Giuntoli) is able to see fairy tale demons hiding among us &#8211; we might see only a cute girl with a nice smile, but Nick sees the monster underneath.  So Nick is a hero &#8211; he goes after the creatures of the night to protect the rest of us.  But it&#8217;s all based on fairy tales and folklore, not on things a whole lot of people really believe!In FRAILITY, Fenton&#8217;s dad isn&#8217;t going after Blutbaden and Hexenbiesters &#8211; he&#8217;s going after real demons (the devil&#8217;s spawn, even) on a mission of God.  And if he&#8217;s truly God&#8217;s emissary, then he&#8217;s doing the right thing when he hacks a woman to death, or when he drags a middle-aged man into the back of a van, or when he buries the body parts in among the rose bushes.  Right?  I mean, if he&#8217;s NOT insane, then he&#8217;s a holy man.  And if he&#8217;s a holy man, doing God&#8217;s work, then he&#8217;s blessed among men.  And anything Fenton might do to try to stop him is . . . well, it&#8217;s wrong.  Right?At the end of this film you&#8217;ll be asking those questions.  And if you&#8217;re like me, you won&#8217;t have any answers.  FRAILTY would have worked a whole lot better for me if the answer to the ultimate question (is Fenton&#8217;s dad crazy, or is he really God&#8217;s right-hand man?) was left open ended.  Because once you know the truth, you&#8217;re stuck with a reality that is just too close to some of the craziness that has really happened in this world of ours.  A whole lot of people do a whole lot of terrible things in the name of God.  FRAILTY suggests that terrible things aren&#8217;t terrible at all if God has ordained them . . . even if it&#8217;s an axe-wielding lunatic who&#8217;s carrying them out.I appreciate the performances in FRAILTY, and Paxton&#8217;s direction is on point and compelling.  This is a gripping film.  But it&#8217;s also disturbing, and not in the expected ways.  The true horror of FRAILTY is that there are tons of people who will watch it and believe &#8211; really believe &#8211; that God directs people to do horrific things in His name.  And that&#8217;s too scary, even for a horror film.  Watch this one with a huge grain of salt &#8211; and talk about it afterwards.  Because once we accept &#8211; even for a little while &#8211; that a serial killer can be doing God&#8217;s work, then we&#8217;re truly lost.  Good film, creepy message.

Instead, it has more to do with commitment to one's beliefs, even if following them means murder.Bill Paxton is believable as a father who suddenly has a vision from God who gives him a list of demons to kill ( demons who are disguised as people living ordinary lives). When he tells his two young sons this, one of them, Fenton, is sceptical and, understandably, fears his father is going crazy. The other son is an instant believer.From this beginning, the movie veers off in different directions, all of them fascinating. I thought could see the twists in this one coming but I was wrong.

Bernabo,"[1, 3]","&quot;Frailty&quot; is a very good film and the only reason I would not claim it was a great movie is because it is not quite a film that you would want to see over and over again, which I think is a key part of what makes a film great.  You should watch &quot;Frailty&quot; a second time, primarily to pay attention to how the film was put together in terms of setting up the payoff.  You will see that this is a solid little film, without any major holes, which is certainly a rare enough state of affairs with regards to movies today.Like reviewing &quot;Memento&quot; it is hard to explain why I liked &quot;Frailty&quot; without giving away too much and spoiling your enjoyment of the film.  The script by Brent Hanley tells of a Southern gothic horror story that plays with and off of our assumptions about religious fanaticism.  This is a haunted film, both in terms of the story and the look of the film, the latter due to Bill Butler's photography.  Matthew McConaughey's character shows up at the office of Powers Booth's F.B.I. agent to say that he knows who is the serial killer called God's Hand.  Like Booth's character, we are suspicious from the first and the success of this film is based entirely on how deep in the spell of the story being told we fall.  I think most people who are fans of this genre are going to fall pretty deep.Included in the DVD extras is a Sundance channel &quot;Anatomy of a Scene&quot; feature that provides nice in-depth analysis of a key scene from the film of the sort that you rarely get to see outside of a college film course and provides graphic evidence of Bill Butler's wonderful work with lighting.Yes, I appropriated the title of this review from a description of the story on the making of the film featurette, because I liked it and I knew I was not going to come up with anything better.",4,Edgar Allan Poe's version of the Prodigal Son,1040515200,"12 22, 2002",2002,1846,"['quot', 'Frailty', 'quot', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'only', 'reason', 'would', 'not', 'claim', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'quite', 'film', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'over', 'again', 'think', 'key', 'part', 'what', 'film', 'great', 'should', 'watch', 'quot', 'Frailty', 'quot', 'second', 'time', 'primarily', 'pay', 'attention', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'terms', 'setting', 'up', 'payoff', 'will', 'see', 'solid', 'little', 'film', 'major', 'holes', 'certainly', 'rare', 'enough', 'state', 'affairs', 'regards', 'movies', 'reviewing', 'quot', 'Memento', 'quot', 'hard', 'explain', 'why', 'liked', 'quot', 'Frailty', 'quot', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'spoiling', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'script', 'Brent', 'Hanley', 'tells', 'Southern', 'gothic', 'horror', 'story', 'assumptions', 'religious', 'fanaticism', 'haunted', 'film', 'terms', 'story', 'look', 'film', 'latter', 'due', 'Bill', 'Butler', 'photography', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'character', 'up', 'office', 'Powers', 'Booth', 'F.B.I', 'agent', 'say', 'who', 'serial', 'killer', 'called', 'God', 'Hand', 'Booth', 'character', 'are', 'suspicious', 'first', 'success', 'film', 'based', 'entirely', 'how', 'deep', 'spell', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'fall', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'genre', 'are', 'going', 'fall', 'pretty', 'deep.Included', 'DVD', 'extras', 'Sundance', 'channel', 'quot', 'Anatomy', 'Scene', 'quot', 'feature', 'nice', 'in-depth', 'analysis', 'key', 'scene', 'film', 'sort', 'rarely', 'get', 'see', 'college', 'film', 'course', 'graphic', 'evidence', 'Bill', 'Butler', 'wonderful', 'work', 'lighting.Yes', 'appropriated', 'title', 'review', 'description', 'story', 'making', 'film', 'featurette', 'liked', 'knew', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'come', 'up', 'anything', 'better']",Frailty
710422,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00006AUJR,Lawyeraau,"[11, 11]","I happened to catch this film on the Sci-Fi Channel on cable last night, and am I ever glad that I did! This has got to be one of the best films that I have ever seen in this genre. It  is a veritable masterpiece, delivering a great storyline, an amazing directorial debut by Bill Paxton, and excellent performances by the entire cast. What could be better?The film revolves around the happy and loving Meeks family, which consists of a Texas widower (Bill Paxton) and his two boys, Fenton and Adam. All is well until late one night, when this pleasant, mild-mannered father claims to have received a visitation from an angel with a very special message for him from God. It seems that demons are among us, disguised as human beings. It appears that Dad, as well as his boys, are being given a very special mission. They are to destroy these demons. God will supply the weapons and the names of those who are to be destroyed. Dad will be able to ensure that he is destroying a demon simply by laying his hands upon the purported demon.  Therein lies the tale, and it is a positively chilling one.This living nightmare is recalled in  flashback by one of the now grown boys (Mathew McConaughey) to FBI Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe), who is investigating a series of killings referred to as the ""God's Hand"" murders. He recounts what life was like for the Meeks family after dear old Dad got his divine calling and woke them up one night from a sound sleep to tell them of his new found mission. The boys are sworn to secrecy and are called upon to assist with this divine calling.  While the younger boy, Adam, gets with the program, the older son, Fenton,  is clearly disturbed by what he sees as the psychotic transformation of his formerly benign father. He is only hoping that things will blow over, and Dad will return to normal. Unfortunately, things will never again be the same.Bill Paxton's directorial debut may best be described as stunningly self-assured. His direction is deft, yet restrained, as he is obviously someone who knows that less is more. He certainly realizes  that what passes through the viewer's imagination can often be far more terrifying than any garish special effects.  Consequently, this is not a film for those who look for mindless blood splatter and gore, as there is virtually none of that in this film. The camera rightly turns away at the crucial moment, leaving the viewer's imagination to work overtime.The performances that are exacted from the cast are uniformly terrific, but there are two that merit special note. Bill Paxton is simply astounding, giving a bravura performance that is complex and compelling. The viewer believes all along that he is truly a loving father, even when he is seemingly at his most psychotic and on his divine mission destroying demons. Matt O'Leary also gives a singular performance as young Fenton, the son who has difficulty accepting the tune that his beloved father is now singing.  His is an angst filled performance that will tear at the viewer's heart.This is truly a terrific tale of gothic horror and one that deserves to become a classic. It boasts an intelligent and clever screenplay by Brent Hanley with enough twists and turns to keep the viewer guessing until the very end. It is a screenplay that has many layers of complexity. The question for the viewer is whether or not Dad was simply a delusional psychotic killer or truly acting upon a divine mission. This may not be as easy to answer as one may think.All in all, this is a superlative film that is worthy of being in one's personal collection.

710423,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00006AUJR,Lee Armstrong,"[6, 17]","The problem with enjoying this film is that we have to accept that God would give a hit list to a serial killer and go around blurring video screens & hazing the memories of FBI agents to protect the killers.  This view of God is so backward, that it predates the Old Testament God of Wrath.  It's a kind of Osama Bin Laden approach to the Almighty.  Beyond obnoxious, it doesn't work.  So as a flick with any theological basis, ""Frailty"" is awful.That said, there are still some amazing things in the film.  The best is the performance of Matthew O'Leary as the older son Fenton who sees his dad going crazy.  O'Leary also did a similarly excellent job fending off stepdad Vince Vaughn in ""Domestic Distrubance"" with John Travolta.  Here, he has so many shadings as a youth dealing with a mentally unbalanced parent, that it is a marvelous film for showing that.  We feel his uncertainty, defiance, condemnation and love for his father.Director of photography Bill Butler does a great job with giving the film its own look.  His work on Conversation & One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest shows the class he brings to this project.  From the dark shadows of the cemetery to the shaded cellar to the light of day where we breathe a bit easier, his contribution is masterful.Matthew McConaughey as the grown son of Bill Paxton does a great job of relating the tale in flashbacks.  Powers Boothe as the FBI agent has a nice cameo as does Luke Askew as Sherriff Smalls.  Paxton does a decent job of directing this, with great pacing that tenses and relaxes repeatedly drawing us to the film's climax.  The DVD version has interesting deleted scenes including Fenton trying to outwit his dad with Bible references.As a cinematic experience, this was a pretty good movie.

With two young sons, he sets about his grisly business. This is a frame tale, in which the story is related by one of the two sons, now grown up (Matthew McConaghey), to an FBI agent, Powers Boothe. Paxton is a canny director; as he mentions in one of the several bonus features that comes with the movie, he selected Texas actors he felt were strong choices for the roles--and did a great job with casting.There are several reasons this is such a great movie. One is that it doesn't hit the viewer over the head with obvious horror cliches; another is that the violence is shown, but not its immediate aftermath, which means the standard blood and gore is significantly minimized. It's clear that what's important here is not the blood and gore but instead the intense psychology of what is real and what isn't in the context of religious fanaticism, and/or emotional desperation. Is Paxton's character driven to this by overwhelming grief--which he can never show--from the loss of his wife? By his own internal demons? Or by actual visitation from God, as he claims?As Paxton also says in the bonus features, the casting of the two young boys playing his sons was crucial and here again he did a sterling job. The two young actors are superior, terrifically complementing McConaghey and Boothe in their one-to-one standoff, contrasting present day with 1979, when the events depicted (the destroying of the seven demons) actually occurred.This is a terrific, strong entry in the horror genre and should be seen as such.

710429,AXLW246TETRY1,B00006AUJR,Lunchbox,"[3, 3]","&quot;Frailty&quot; tells the story of two boys, Fenton and Adam, who live with their father (director and actor Bill Paxton) who, one night, has a vision coming from God that guides him to a path of killing. He has to kill demons that live among humans, and that have the aspect of human beings. The two boys are forced to witness and participate to the slayings, but the oldest, Fenton, has a different opinion on all that...Seems very simple? I'm not telling you more than that, because any other detail about the plot would be too much...and let me tell you that the film is much more than that, really. There is an impressive amount of sub-plots and it truly is one of the most complicated films since Curtis Hanson's &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;.Directed by Bill Paxton, known for his roles in James Cameron's &quot;Aliens&quot; and Sam Raimi's &quot;A Simple Plan&quot; among many others, this man proves that he's not only a good actor, but also a very promising director. Paxton's film is dark, hypnotic, it truly has a creepy atmosphere that reminds of Danny Boyle's &quot;Shallow Grave&quot;. The film is structured in two different periods of time, one is the sons' youth, and the other is their adulthood, but both of them are haunting and amazingly moody and well-done.The acting is really great too, and the boys surprised me...personally, except for Danny Lloyd in Stanley Kubrick's &quot;The Shining&quot; and a couple of other young actors that did a good job, I didn't see god young actors very often...but these guys are very good. Bill Paxton, Matthew McConaughey and Powers Boothe all made an extremely good job acting, especially Paxton, who plays a very believable and likeable father that is tormented and deranged but still believes in what he does. His character is full of dilemmas, goodness, and a part of evil (that borrows the name of good in the film). McConaughey reminds me of Kevin Spacey's character in Brian Synger's &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;. You'll have to see the film to understand what I just said...really. Powers Boothe is great too, with another character that brings plot twists, even though that could be the last thing you'd expect. Great acting.And now, a very strong element in this film, the scenario. It is really good. It takes the skeleton of an horror movie, to which rich plot twists are added in addition of interesting characters we TRULY care about. And that's a rare thing in an horror film. The dialogues are quite good, and the story, even though it may first sound pretty simple is very developped and complex. Brent Hanley (the man that wrote the film) is close to Christopher McQuarrie (the scenarist of &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;) and I'd even say he (kind of) has more merit because he made an HORROR film scary and truly intelligent taking a different path than Stephen King with &quot;The Shining&quot;, which has intelligent horror based on insanity...&quot;Frailty&quot;, somehow, took this path, but wrote a scenario that could still make sense in a Crime film or Film-Noir...and he still gave a scary flavor to his story, and Paxton enriched it with his nice directing. Hanley is the Ray Bradbury of these days, really.Overall, those who are tired of recent horror films (the boring &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, the ridiculous &quot;Queen of The Damned&quot;, or the fundamentally awful &quot;Valentine&quot;, among others) will be pleased. People who think horror movies are stupid will be stunned. People that believe horror movies contain gallons of blood will be speechless. This film is very good. Very good. It is entertaining, but not in the usual Hollywood way to be entertained...there are no special effects, no CGI, no creature effects, no gore...but that's not the point! This is an (unfortunately) unusual way to make an horror movie...this film is original, simple but at the same time very complex (you may need more than one viewing to catch it all). You'll watch five minutes of it, and you'll be hooked until the very uncommon and GREAT ending. Some scenes are disturbing for the characters, but not for the viewer, the nuance is that the viewer feels how disturbed the characters are, and we feel really close to them...that's how an horror film should work! Also, there are many discussion topics in this film, and they question many things and believe me, this film will make many think...especially about religion. &quot;Frailty&quot; criticizes religion, especially the way believers understand it. &quot;Frailty&quot; has many faces, it's a rich film, and it is very enjoyable, especially for those who love horror films. But the range of viewers is much wider than that. Haunting film. Great directing and scenario. Oh yeah, and acting too.

This is actor Bill Paxton's first directorial effort, and it's a promising one. A good thriller keeps you interested - and keeps you guessing - despite its plot holes and lapses in logic. ""Frailty"" does these things and then provides an ending so bizarre that you're apt to get into a lively debate about what it all means. It reminds me of two other very fine independent movies about the possible nature of God - ""Eye of God"" [1997] and, especially, ""The Rapture"" [1991].On a dark, rainy night, a Dallas FBI agent [Powers Boothe] arrives at work to find an enigmatic young man [Matthew McConaughey] in his office. The man, who says his name is Fenton Meeks, claims that his brother, Adam, is the `Hand of God' serial killer. Though skeptical, the agent lets Fenton tell his tale - one of horror, madness and murder dating back more than twenty years. It begins when his father [Bill Paxton] tells the boys that God has come him in a vision and told him to rid the world of certain people because they were demons. The boys are to help him.At first the story sounds too ludicrous to be believed. How could such things happen in a small Texas town without anyone's finding out? Why couldn't Fenton simply tell someone or run away? In the end, though, all is explained in an ending as fantastical but as logical within the framework of the story as the ending of ""The Sixth Sense"".Paxton, McConaughey and Boothe give fine performances, but it is 12-year old Jeremy Spencer, as young Adam, who shines. The movie revolves around him and might have fallen apart in the hands of a less talented actor.""Frailty"" is creepy, unsettling but very well made.

I could not wait to purchase it!""Frailty"" is a dark and terrifying film that surprised me so many times. Just when I thought I knew what was going on, the next scene would prove me wrong. The complexity and creativeness that went into this film is so mind-blowing.  It takes risks, and forces us to ask questions that are better left unanswered.A series of murders has been contaminating a small town. The case is known as the ""God's Hand"". The movie starts with McConaughey entering the FBI station, claiming that he knows who the ""God's Hand"" killer is. With this, he tells his story and we witness shocking flashbacks to when he was a kid.Paxton, who is also the director, stars as a very religious and loving father. His two sons, (remember, this is all McConaughey's story, so this entire part is the flashback) mean all the world to him. Everything seems perfect, until Paxton awakes his sons, telling him that an angel visited him at night, telling him that there were demons lurking around and they took the form of human-beings. He instructs his sons that they must ""destroy"" them. (Meaning, ""killing."") The oldest son thinks his father has lost it, but he has no idea how far things are about to go. I cannot tell you anymore, otherwise it'll ruin the movie for you. Know this, however, you will be shocked, and you will feel disturbed when it is all said and done.Bill Paxton does an outstanding job as a first time director. This is the type of movie that really requires talent from famous and acclaimed directors, but Paxton proves to us that not only can he act, but he can direct. Every shot in the movie is very well planned and laid out. He also proves exactly what kinds of emotions he wants his actors to show us. That task, I'm sure, is not a very easy one.  The acting was really impressive, and must've been quite a chore to accomplish in this type of film.  It is the direction and the acting that makes this movie so unique and chilling.Yes, this film is very disturbing and very violent. Not in graphic detail; there's hardly any blood or gore. It's just the overall idea and the way the ""destruction of the demons"" are presented to us. Be warned; this is not for people with weak hearts or stomaches.This movie still shocked and frightened me, even seeing it for the second time.  Even though I knew exactly what was going to happen, I still felt very uneasy and disturbed, as if I were just experiencing it for the first time.Now, on to the DVD.  For it being an independent film, it has some pretty neat features, including commentary, a making of feature, theatrical trailer, and more.  The picture and sound quality was also very good.This movie isn't for everybody, especially if you are the really religous type who get offended easily.  This movie IS NOT FOR YOU!  Don't even attempt it!  If you can handle dark and terrifying thrillers, than chances are you will enjoy this film.

710437,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00006AUJR,Miles D. Moore,"[3, 4]","&quot;Frailty,&quot; Bill Paxton's directorial debut, is a swift, tightly focused and darkly compelling thriller that leaves us with a lot of fascinating, disturbing questions at the end. Screenwriter Brent Hanley's story begins simply: Dad Meeks (Paxton) is a friendly, uncomplicated blue-collar guy in small-town Texas who adores his two small sons, Fenton (Matt O'Leary) and Adam (Jeremy Sumpter), whom he raises alone after the death of his wife. Everything goes smoothly until one night when Dad tells his sons that he's been visited by an angel of the Lord, who has told him the world is about to end. To further the Lord's mission, Dad must become an avenging angel himself, slaughtering demons in human form with the help of his sons. Fenton and Adam have very different reactions to their father's revelations, and it's absolutely no fair to reveal anything else about the plot, except that it uses the framing device of one of Dad's now-grown sons (Matthew McConaughey) relating the tale of slaughter to an FBI agent (Powers Boothe). The story can best be described as Hitchcockian, with liberal dollops of &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; and the &quot;Left Behind&quot; novels; intellectual snobs may even detect a whiff of Borges. Paxton gives the film's best scenes a Hitchcockian clarity and breathlessness. The actors are also very, very good, particularly Paxton and young O'Leary, a real find. The DVD extras--including deleted scenes, a making-of-the-movie documentary and an analysis of one of the movie's key scenes that ran originally on the Sundance Channel--are fascinating and testify to the astuteness of Paxton's choices in this movie. Here's hoping his first film isn't his last!",5,Knocks the breath right out of you.,1084579200,"05 15, 2004",2004,1705,"['quot', 'Frailty', 'quot', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'directorial', 'debut', 'swift', 'tightly', 'focused', 'darkly', 'compelling', 'thriller', 'lot', 'fascinating', 'disturbing', 'questions', 'end', 'Screenwriter', 'Brent', 'Hanley', 'story', 'simply', 'Dad', 'Meeks', 'Paxton', 'friendly', 'uncomplicated', 'blue-collar', 'guy', 'small-town', 'Texas', 'who', 'two', 'small', 'sons', 'Fenton', 'Matt', ""O'Leary"", 'Adam', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', 'whom', 'alone', 'death', 'wife', 'Everything', 'smoothly', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'Dad', 'sons', 'been', 'visited', 'angel', 'Lord', 'who', 'told', 'world', 'end', 'further', 'Lord', 'mission', 'Dad', 'must', 'become', 'avenging', 'angel', 'slaughtering', 'demons', 'human', 'form', 'help', 'sons', 'Fenton', 'Adam', 'have', 'very', 'different', 'reactions', 'father', 'revelations', 'absolutely', 'fair', 'reveal', 'anything', 'else', 'plot', 'framing', 'device', 'one', 'Dad', 'now-grown', 'sons', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'relating', 'tale', 'slaughter', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'story', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'Hitchcockian', 'liberal', 'dollops', 'quot', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'quot', 'quot', 'Left', 'Behind', 'quot', 'novels', 'intellectual', 'snobs', 'may', 'even', 'detect', 'whiff', 'Borges', 'Paxton', 'film', 'best', 'scenes', 'Hitchcockian', 'clarity', 'breathlessness', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'particularly', 'Paxton', 'young', ""O'Leary"", 'real', 'find', 'DVD', 'extras', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'making-of-the-movie', 'documentary', 'analysis', 'one', 'movie', 'key', 'scenes', 'ran', 'originally', 'Sundance', 'Channel', 'are', 'fascinating', 'testify', 'astuteness', 'Paxton', 'choices', 'movie', 'Here', 'hoping', 'first', 'film', ""n't"", 'last']",Frailty

Do you like to see gifted actors work emotions on film? Can you do without big budget effects?Great. You'll love this ""small"" but gut-wrenching film.You have the synopsis from the other posts and the editorial reviews, so you know what it's about.  Here are some additional comments from me:I disagree with the previous poster who gave this a one-star review because the ending doesn't work. I think the ending works. The director and writer made the film in such a way that they drop many hints (visual and verbal) that make the ending probable and believable. Now, probable and believable are both subjective concepts, aren't they? I mean probable and believable within the scope of the film's reality.  Do people lie? Sure. Do people plot and scheme? Yes. Can people become wild religious fanatics and have visions (false or real)? Indeed. Can deeds be deemed good or evil based on context? Absolutely. If a man sticks a knife in a woman's gut he could be evil (as in murdering a girlfriend who rejects his control in a fit of jealousy) or good (a surgeon removing an ovarian cancer). Context is all. Perception can be skewed.This film is all about context and perception. What is really being said? What is really being done? And who is good and who is evil?You'll have to decide that by the time the film ends. You may not like the answer.I also disagree with the reviewer who said this film is not for Christians. It certainly can be enjoyed by Christians (I'm one, and I'm pretty dang devout! I have been called a ""holy roller"" and ""Bible thumper"" in my day.)  I found this highly involving and emotional. This is a film full of deeds we would be quick to label as moral/immoral, of people we will be hasty to judge, but it is also one that never really denigrates God. If anything, it has something to say about the ""frailty"" of human choices and perceptions, but it is not disrespecting of God.What is tragic becomes tragedy by film's end. What is sad becomes nearly unbearable. Be ready for a descent into a dark, dark world. And yet, one that rings oddly true, at least for anyone who believes the stories in the Old Testament. Once you ""see"" , you understand. :)Matt McC and Mr. Paxton were terrific in this, as were the young boy actors. I hope Mr. Paxton gets to direct some more. He did a fine job with this movie that asks and answers the question: ""What makes a good man and loving father become a serial ax murderer?""

710439,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B00006AUJR,Mitch Weaver,"[0, 0]","Frailty revolves around a serial killer called the ""God's Hands Killer"" and a man named Fenton Meeks ( Matthew McCoughaney) that claims to know the true identity of the killer. Fenton walks into the office of FBI agent Wesley Doyle ( Powers Boothe)and tells a story that he claims will shed some light on the case. The story goes back to Fenton's childhood, and revolves around him (Matt O Leary)and his younger brother Adam ( Jeremy Sumpter) raised by their father( Bill Paxton). One night, their father says he is visited by an angel that was sent from God. The angel says God has a mission for him. The mission is for him and his two sons to kill demons disguised as humans. Adam, loves his dad, and is eager to assist him. Fenton however, refuses to participate and sees it as murder. Throughout the whole film, the viewer must ask themselves - Is the father really doing God's work, or he is out of his mind?Frailty is probably one of the best films that I have ever seen. If I had to make a list of my ten favorite films of all time, Frailty would definately be on it. The film's story unfolds briliantly because the focus keeps switching from the present conversation between Matthew McConaughey and Powers Boothe, back to the boys' childhood with their father. It is all tied together wonderfully, and culminates in one of the best endings I have ever seen. It will literally shock you. The film overall is an intelligent horror film that offers a whole new take on a serial killer. It is not your everday pointless Hollywood slasher film. It uses the characters' emotions and what they went through, to drive the story. I also love the controversial take on religion that the story offers. Bill Paxton did an amazing job in his directorial debut! The two young actors Adam ( Jeremy Sumpter) and Fenton ( Matthew O' Leary) were the main reason for the film's success. Paxton successfully manages to make them give the most convincing performance possible. Their performances make what the boys went through very convincing. Matthew McConaughey and Powers Boothe were also great.Frailty was flawless in my eyes. The story unfolds very well, the ending was outstanding, and the performances were all great. The DVD offers an outstanding featurette that takes you into the making of the film.

Jarrett ""SoundgardenFanForLife""","[0, 3]","Bill Paxton must've been really thinking smart when he decided to direct this high-octane chill-ride from start to finish. FRAILTY is a major success for Paxton on all levels, and his role in the movie is every bit as important. His chilling lines and his more-than-frightening atmosphere really keep you on the edge of your seat. Although the pace of the movie is a bit slow at times, Paxton and other stars like Matt O'Leary and Matthew McConaughey provide excellent roles and really manage to shine bright. The scenes where the supposed &quot;demons&quot; are disposed of are truly frightening, without having to show any blood, guts, or gore. And one particular scene involving Matthew McConaughey and the detective will truly make you jump (let's just say the &quot;ax&quot; is chilling in this scene). This movie has thrills, chills, and all the right ingredients for a scary movie...and succeeds quite well.Bill Paxton was smart to make FRAILTY. Critically acclaimed and hailed by many who went to see it, myself included, this DVD movie is worth the purchase and worth the ultimate attention. If you watch this movie before bedtime, you might not want to go to sleep right away...it's just that scary.

I did finally see the film now that it has been out on video and the like. I was totally surprised by how it developed and turned out. Some people are classifying this as horror and that is not the case. This film is more in the mystery, suspense territory: (the UNBREAKABLE league). I mean what the story sets the viewer up for takes a very stunning twist and turn at the end. Because I know movies well, I kind of was on target with my initial prediction but it was further off point than I would have ever imagined.This is one of those films that contain many religious elements about God but SEEMINGLY taken too far to the zealous and fanatical level. However, although I am a devout Christian, I was kind of turned off by the craziness of Bill Paxton towards his children about killing the demons that lurk the earth. I thought for sure that he was out of his mind; that he had some kind of mental condition that was seriously affecting him. I was wrong as the film went on though because it is something that was substantial. It was actually a mission from God that he was put on with his sons who have their own twists with who is really who and who is not on the dad's side and who is really what the dad is against. I do not want to give all of the plot away but this is definitely a film that you gotta see. I really do not promote films that much but I am going to get all the people I know to see this masterpiece of a film. The directions that it travels down is fascinating.

They are the ones who feel that they are on a mission in life, powered by God or some other cosmic force to make the world a better place by eliminating the bad things or bad people.  This was a movie about so called average so-and-sos who are making the world a better place by eliminating bad people all the while justifying thier evil.Fenton Meeks calls the police one night after the suicide of his brother Adam.  He wants to tell the chief of police that his brother was the infamous God's Hand Killer who had terrorized the area years ago.  He went on to tell the story of their youth, when he and Adam were living with their widowed father in a small town in Texas.  One night, their father wakes them up to tell them that he had received a message from God that they are to cleanse the world of sin.  Suddenly, Fenton and Adam find themselves as accessories to their father's quest to rid the world of sinners and evil.  Fenton is terrified, Adam being the younger and more impressionable, believes their father and is more than willing to aid them.  The movie unfolds with the series of murders they commit as a threesome, and the efforts Fenton makes to break free of their father's mad grip on them.As an adult, Fenton and Adam are dysfuntional adults without cause or discipline.  Once the police discover Adam's home with all the trophies and tell tale evidence of his past, it seems an open and shut case.  There are two nice twists at the end, however (of which I won't reveil here).This was a good movie in the sense that the boys were complete pawns and helpless to rebel against their father's madness.  Being an accomplice is one thing, but with a parent being a villan adds a new dimension to it.

However, when Bill Paxton's 'Frailty' was released it was awash with praise from such prestigious sources as James Cameron (who worked with Paxton on 'Aliens' and 'Titanic'), Sam Raimi and Stephen King.  And to an extent this is rightly so.  Paxton has produced an effectively put together, suspense-filled horror movie that marks itself from the rest of the batch of scary films flooding the market right now.The premise has Paxton as an ordinary guy that believes he has heard a message from God to go out an kill 'demons' with an axe.  Taking his sons along for the ride he tells them that such demons look like ordinary people but they're not.  And so the death toll mounts up, with one of his sons being a great deal more skeptical than the other.  Fast forward to the present day and we have Matthew McConaughey telling the detective in charge of investigating the God's hand murders why he believes it's his brother committing the crimes, thus unravelling his own knotted childhood in the process.What's most impressive about this film is that it is actually quite disturbing, something that is certainly praise-worthy given that you don't actually see any of the murders (a wise decision, given the recent proneness to blood and gore).  Paxton understands that the most disturbing aspects of the story aren't the crimes themselves but the gradual corruption of the two children in the story and the juxtaposition of what the family does at night with their humdrum existence watching TV or eating family meals together (even if there is one murder scene in particular that will make you jump out of your skin).  However, it is the immensely assured and matured performance from Matthew O'Leary as Paxton's son, Fenton, that provides the emotional centrepiece of the entire movie.  Managing to convey fear, love and loathing all at the same time puts him in the Haley Joel Osmont category of child acting and if his work on 'Frailty' is anything to go by, he's destined for greater things.Given this, it's a real shame that the twist at the end is so obvious and that the action that takes place in the present day is too muddled and confused to provide any kind of real climax.  Still, kudos should definitely be awarded for not only a very impressive directorial debut but also a great performance from Paxton, and a story that really sets you on edge.  This is probably the best horror film of the year so far, especially given the fact that Paxton didn't feel a need to overpopulate his screen with hormonal teenagers and excessive violence.

He convinces the youngest of his sons, but has trouble getting his eldest son to believe the story.  The scary thing about this film is, Bill Paxton truly believes it himself.The two kids are witness to their father murdering a number of ""demons"" in their toolshed, and with each murder the oldest son feels more and more tension growing between him and his father, and even tries to convince his younger brother to run away with him.The kids are wonderful actors, and Bill Paxton is amazing.  He is a truly talented actor, and as he proves with this film, a very talented director as well.Some of the scenes in this movie are very disturbing, and they deal with murder and child abuse, but it's all key to the plot.

710453,ARIHVRQ9VH0OQ,B00006AUJR,Nick Schwartz,"[3, 4]","""Frailty,"" actor Bill Paxton's feature-film directing debut, is a remarkably structured, thriller; a film with religious and supernatural themes you are not sure whether to believe, but are, nevertheless, utterly convincing throughout.  Without giving too much of the story, all you need to know is that ""Frailty"" tells the story (through flashback) of a father (Paxton) and his two young sons.  They live in small-town Texas, and one night, the father has a vision from an angel, who informs him he and his two sons have been chosen to destroy demons, who are hidden all around them in human form.  The film deals predominantly with the feelings of Fenton, the eldest of the two sons, who is old enough to understand that perhaps his father is going crazy.However, throughout the film, there are many hints to suggest the father is not making it all up, and in this, the film is successful at completely engrossing the viewer.The film has a terrific - and more importantly, believable and fully explained - climax, and it will leave you with a lasting sense of discomfort.Also, the musical score by Brian Tyler (""Six-String Samurai,"" and ""Bubba Ho-tep""), is appropriately gorgeous and haunting.The DVD itself has two great featurettes, one of which is a basic 'making-of', the other, a special from the Sundance Channel, the ""Anatomy of a Scene"", where one of the film's most crucial scenes is picked apart from concept, through production.  It is a fascinating documentary, and offers amazing insight in to the making of films in general.My only complaint is that the DVD transfer seems to be lacking a bit, visually.  But, it is not enough to destroy the movie, by any means.  This is a must-see for thriller-fans, if you can stomach some of the difficult themes.",5,A Deeply Disturbing Thriller,1137024000,"01 12, 2006",2006,1766,"['Frailty', 'actor', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'feature-film', 'directing', 'debut', 'remarkably', 'structured', 'thriller', 'film', 'religious', 'supernatural', 'themes', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'believe', 'are', 'nevertheless', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'need', 'know', 'Frailty', 'story', 'flashback', 'father', 'Paxton', 'two', 'young', 'sons', 'live', 'small-town', 'Texas', 'one', 'night', 'father', 'vision', 'angel', 'who', 'two', 'sons', 'have', 'been', 'chosen', 'destroy', 'demons', 'who', 'are', 'hidden', 'human', 'form', 'film', 'deals', 'predominantly', 'feelings', 'Fenton', 'eldest', 'two', 'sons', 'who', 'old', 'enough', 'understand', 'perhaps', 'father', 'going', 'crazy.However', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'hints', 'suggest', 'father', 'not', 'making', 'up', 'film', 'successful', 'completely', 'engrossing', 'viewer.The', 'film', 'terrific', 'more', 'importantly', 'believable', 'fully', 'explained', 'climax', 'will', 'leave', 'lasting', 'sense', 'discomfort.Also', 'musical', 'score', 'Brian', 'Tyler', 'Six-String', 'Samurai', 'Bubba', 'Ho-tep', 'appropriately', 'gorgeous', 'haunting.The', 'DVD', 'two', 'great', 'featurettes', 'one', 'basic', ""'making-of"", 'other', 'special', 'Sundance', 'Channel', 'Anatomy', 'Scene', 'where', 'one', 'film', 'most', 'crucial', 'scenes', 'picked', 'apart', 'concept', 'production', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'amazing', 'insight', 'making', 'films', 'general.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'be', 'lacking', 'bit', 'visually', 'not', 'enough', 'destroy', 'movie', 'means', 'must-see', 'thriller-fans', 'can', 'stomach', 'difficult', 'themes']",Frailty

This film is very unusual.  It starts off as a seemingly standard thriller, but it mesmerizes you with a build-up that makes the ending nearly impossible to guess.  That to me is the markings of a superb first-rate thriller/horror film.  Bill Paxton is truly a talented director and the screenplay is excellent.  The acting work of the principal characters is compelling and the film at first appears to be the story of a man gone mad.  Paxton's character is seemingly a man who is going insane as he claims that he is receiving visions from God that instruct him to kill people who are demons in disguise.  What's more disturbing is that he drags his two small boys into this venture of being ""god's hands"" on earth.  The two child actors (Matthew O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter) also do an excellent and natural job as the Mieks brothers.  Fenton, the older boy, opposes his father's new ""divine"" mission, while Adam seems to have fallen under his father's ""spell"" and believes that they are a family of demon-fighters.  The film is presented in two timelines, one taking place in the present and the other described in flashbacks by the grown Fenton Mieks (played nicely by Mathew McConaughey) who narrates the events to an FBI agent played by Powers Boothe.  This is a gem of a film and disappeared at the box office almost overnight (not surprising as it has a weak title and was not marketed effectively in my opinion), but is worth checking out if you enjoy surprising thrillers made with an independent vein.",5,A surprising thriller that will keep you guessing,1041206400,"12 30, 2002",2002,1653,"['missing', 'film', 'theaters', 'rave', 'got', 'had', 'time', 'see', 'finally', 'got', 'chance', 'see', 'film', 'dvd', 'film', 'very', 'unusual', 'off', 'seemingly', 'standard', 'thriller', 'build-up', 'ending', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'guess', 'markings', 'superb', 'first-rate', 'thriller/horror', 'film', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'truly', 'talented', 'director', 'screenplay', 'excellent', 'acting', 'work', 'principal', 'characters', 'compelling', 'film', 'first', 'be', 'story', 'man', 'gone', 'mad', 'Paxton', 'character', 'seemingly', 'man', 'who', 'going', 'insane', 'receiving', 'visions', 'God', 'kill', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'demons', 'disguise', 'What', 'more', 'disturbing', 'two', 'small', 'boys', 'venture', 'being', 'god', 'hands', 'earth', 'two', 'child', 'actors', 'Matthew', ""O'Leary"", 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', 'also', 'do', 'excellent', 'natural', 'job', 'Mieks', 'brothers', 'Fenton', 'older', 'boy', 'father', 'new', 'divine', 'mission', 'Adam', 'have', 'fallen', 'father', 'spell', 'are', 'family', 'demon-fighters', 'film', 'presented', 'two', 'timelines', 'one', 'taking', 'place', 'present', 'other', 'described', 'flashbacks', 'grown', 'Fenton', 'Mieks', 'played', 'nicely', 'Mathew', 'McConaughey', 'who', 'events', 'FBI', 'agent', 'played', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'gem', 'film', 'disappeared', 'box', 'office', 'almost', 'overnight', 'not', 'surprising', 'weak', 'title', 'was', 'not', 'marketed', 'effectively', 'opinion', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'enjoy', 'surprising', 'thrillers', 'made', 'independent', 'vein']",Frailty

710458,A157XTSMJH9XA4,B00006AUJR,One of many,"[5, 7]","The Meiks brothers had a troubled childhood. Very troubled. Their mother had died after Adam was born, leaving his older brother Fenton to take care of him with the help of their father. The three males seemed to fend well for themselves, not running into too many bumps in their simple yet strange road in life. It was a fairly close-knit family with plenty of pleasant memories and more to come. But all of that changed one night when Dad (curiously, his name was never revealed in the film, being credited as ""Dad Meiks"") rushed into the boys' room, flipped on the light, woke them up, and began to unravel an unusual tale that would change the very course of their lives in a most dramatic way. Dad had been visited by an angel - an angel sent by God himself. The heavenly apparition told him of his new calling: to be a destroyer of demons. According to the angel, the biblical end times had come and there were demons of Hell now walking among mortal man, disguised as humans. Dad would be given sacred weapons from the angel soon, and thereafter he would receive a list. The list held the names of the demons in disguise - names that appeared to be mere human identities, but, just like the demons themselves, were simply cover-ups for the true evil that lurked in their soul. It was now up to this family of three to become warriors of God. The young Adam obeyed his father and came to believe every bit of it. But Fenton was disturbed by these ideas, insisting to himself that his father had lost his mind and nothing this crazy could be real. Yet surely enough, step by step, it all began becoming a reality. The main slaughtering weapon had been retrieved - an abandoned axe in an old shed, with gloves by its side. They came to find out, that the gloves were for Dad to use when capturing the demons and bringing them back to the house. Because when he would remove the gloves and touch them with his bare hands, he could see their dark sin nature and know for sure who they really were. They weren't humans of course, they were pathetic demons - no match for the wrath of God that was being handed out through this divinely chosen man and his sons. At first Fenton wanted to run away and get help. But as time moved on, trapped within this world of madness and extremism, he began to question his reality as a whole. Could he brake away from this terrible mess he'd been drawn into, or was he destined to become a demon-slayer, just as his father was, and just as his brother would come to be? Years later, as a full-grown adult, he gets a frantic phone call from his brother. Shortly after, he decides to give FBI agent Wesley Doyle a visit and finally relieve himself of these secrets that have plagued him all his life. At first Doyle is confused as to why he would come to him to reveal the mystery behind the ""God's Hand"" serial killer case. Yet once he unveils this deranged tale and the story progresses, they take a trip to the burial site of the victims, where reality warps and warps until it all comes into focus. It turns out that the truth is more twisted than the viewer could have ever imagined.2001's Frailty is a dark web beautifully spun by it's makers and deserves a look from any and every fan of suspense and horror films. It's a clever, disturbing, thought-provoking piece with plenty of twists and turns that will leave you impressed - if not a bit creeped out! Starring Bill Paxton, Mathew McConaughey, and Powers Booth (among others) you can be assured that the acting really brings out the depth and haunting minds of the characters. And with a great script and crew work, it's no wonder why this is one of the best films in years for fans of the genre. Not to mention several nice extras on the DVD (including deleted scenes, documentaries/featurettes, and commentary by director/actor Bill Paxton). For sure, Frailty is a winner all the way!",5,"""Sometimes truth defies reason.""",1152748800,"07 13, 2006",2006,3882,"['Meiks', 'brothers', 'had', 'troubled', 'childhood', 'Very', 'troubled', 'mother', 'had', 'died', 'Adam', 'was', 'born', 'leaving', 'older', 'brother', 'Fenton', 'take', 'care', 'help', 'father', 'three', 'males', 'seemed', 'fend', 'well', 'not', 'running', 'too', 'many', 'bumps', 'simple', 'yet', 'strange', 'road', 'life', 'was', 'fairly', 'close-knit', 'family', 'plenty', 'pleasant', 'memories', 'more', 'come', 'changed', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'Dad', 'curiously', 'name', 'was', 'never', 'revealed', 'film', 'being', 'credited', 'Dad', 'Meiks', 'rushed', 'boys', 'room', 'flipped', 'light', 'woke', 'up', 'began', 'unravel', 'unusual', 'tale', 'would', 'change', 'very', 'course', 'lives', 'most', 'dramatic', 'way', 'Dad', 'had', 'been', 'visited', 'angel', 'angel', 'sent', 'God', 'heavenly', 'apparition', 'told', 'new', 'calling', 'be', 'destroyer', 'demons', 'According', 'angel', 'biblical', 'end', 'times', 'had', 'come', 'were', 'demons', 'Hell', 'now', 'walking', 'mortal', 'man', 'disguised', 'humans', 'Dad', 'would', 'be', 'given', 'sacred', 'weapons', 'angel', 'soon', 'thereafter', 'would', 'receive', 'list', 'list', 'held', 'names', 'demons', 'disguise', 'names', 'appeared', 'be', 'mere', 'human', 'identities', 'just', 'demons', 'were', 'simply', 'cover-ups', 'true', 'evil', 'lurked', 'soul', 'was', 'now', 'up', 'family', 'three', 'become', 'warriors', 'God', 'young', 'Adam', 'obeyed', 'father', 'came', 'believe', 'bit', 'Fenton', 'was', 'disturbed', 'ideas', 'insisting', 'father', 'had', 'lost', 'mind', 'nothing', 'crazy', 'could', 'be', 'real', 'surely', 'enough', 'step', 'step', 'began', 'becoming', 'reality', 'main', 'slaughtering', 'weapon', 'had', 'been', 'retrieved', 'abandoned', 'axe', 'old', 'shed', 'gloves', 'side', 'came', 'find', 'out', 'gloves', 'were', 'Dad', 'use', 'when', 'capturing', 'demons', 'bringing', 'back', 'house', 'when', 'would', 'remove', 'gloves', 'touch', 'bare', 'hands', 'could', 'see', 'dark', 'sin', 'nature', 'know', 'sure', 'who', 'really', 'were', 'were', ""n't"", 'humans', 'course', 'were', 'pathetic', 'demons', 'match', 'wrath', 'God', 'was', 'being', 'handed', 'out', 'divinely', 'chosen', 'man', 'sons', 'first', 'Fenton', 'wanted', 'run', 'away', 'get', 'help', 'time', 'moved', 'trapped', 'world', 'madness', 'extremism', 'began', 'question', 'reality', 'whole', 'Could', 'brake', 'away', 'terrible', 'mess', ""'d"", 'been', 'drawn', 'was', 'destined', 'become', 'demon-slayer', 'just', 'father', 'was', 'just', 'brother', 'would', 'come', 'be', 'Years', 'later', 'full-grown', 'adult', 'frantic', 'phone', 'call', 'brother', 'Shortly', 'give', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Wesley', 'Doyle', 'visit', 'finally', 'relieve', 'secrets', 'have', 'plagued', 'life', 'first', 'Doyle', 'confused', 'why', 'would', 'come', 'reveal', 'mystery', 'God', 'Hand', 'serial', 'killer', 'case', 'once', 'deranged', 'tale', 'story', 'take', 'trip', 'burial', 'site', 'victims', 'where', 'reality', 'warps', 'warps', 'focus', 'out', 'truth', 'more', 'twisted', 'viewer', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'imagined.2001', 'Frailty', 'dark', 'web', 'beautifully', 'spun', 'makers', 'look', 'fan', 'suspense', 'horror', 'films', 'clever', 'disturbing', 'thought-provoking', 'piece', 'plenty', 'twists', 'will', 'leave', 'impressed', 'not', 'bit', 'creeped', 'out', 'Starring', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'Mathew', 'McConaughey', 'Powers', 'Booth', 'others', 'can', 'be', 'assured', 'acting', 'really', 'out', 'depth', 'haunting', 'minds', 'characters', 'great', 'script', 'crew', 'work', 'wonder', 'why', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'years', 'fans', 'genre', 'Not', 'mention', 'several', 'nice', 'extras', 'DVD', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'documentaries/featurettes', 'commentary', 'director/actor', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'sure', 'Frailty', 'winner', 'way']",Frailty
710459,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B00006AUJR,OverTheMoon,"[4, 4]","On a quite day in 1979, Bill Paxton (Dad) has a vision that changes his life and the life of his sons, forever. As a single parent mechanic living in rural Texas he now has a new mission - his family are really superheros, chosen by God to do his will, go by the name of ""God's Hands"", and Dad must kill demons with his children, Fenton and Adam... but Fenton does not believe... and we are not so sure either.The theme of Frailty is moral weakness as Fenton, the older of the two children, is having trouble coming to terms with the fact that his father has probably gone insane. Adam, however, trusts everything and when his father uses three magic weapons (given to him by God) to `destroy' the evil, he sees the demons too, but Fenton has no faith and can not see the demons. Also Dad has learned some secrets about Fenton that he hopes to prove wrong. Fenton challenges his father's beliefs, but Dad is having none of that because the mission is to relentlessly destroy demons (who look human) on a list given to them by an angel and to bury the decimated bodies in a rose garden behind their home. It is a destiny that Fenton must recognize before it is too late... but Fenton is frail and he wants to expose his father's sickness to the local town's sheriff.Frailty is told in flashback style as Matthew McConaughey turns up at the FBI, over 30 years since the killings began, to tell Agent Doyle (Powers Boothe) that he knows who the ""God's Hands"" serial killer is, but in order for Doyle to understand more he must listen to the story of ""Dad"" and why he believes that his brother is the ""God Hands"" killer. Are you a little confused? You will be until the final credits role but by then you will have connected everything and the twists are good and many.Frailty is a brilliant movie. In fact it has been a long time coming but Bill Paxton not only has his best role to date, but shines as an actor turned director in the same vein as Clint Eastwood or Sean Penn. The story is near perfection and the acting is on flying form. Frailty will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. It will mess with your mind and turn your world upside down. Seeing Dad slaughter a woman in front of his children will transmit a shrill up your spine every time. You don't know what is going on and your doubts will be many... but maybe your doubts are correct and like Fenton you have been tricked by Dad...Frailty requires repeat viewing to absorb the material entirety. You MUST listen and watch absolutely everything that is going on. Pay attention especially to the names of people. It is an extremely detailed film with much more going on inside than what the story presents us with (and it presents us with a lot and gets even deeper in the final minutes). If the film has any flaw it is only in not revealing enough about the latest work of the ""God's Hands"" serial killer but the motives are there and if you watch the film carefully then you will realize that it is near perfect and any holes in the plot are in fact your own confusions. Repeat viewing is a must if you do not get everything. It is all there though.The bottom line is that Paxton was essentially an 80s actor of mostly horror and sci-fi movies. Here he takes the same 80s horror themes, along with a great story, some fine casting, solid acting and creates a psychological horror of the kind we have not seen in over a decade. If you are a fan of 80s horror, like intelligent psychological horror or feel that the 21st century has delivered on some really dismal horror movies, then Frailty will restore your faith in the system. I am a fan of this genre and I have not seen a good film like this in a long time.

After sitting down with the head of that particular department, he tells his story about his father and brother, and the events that surrounded his father's sudden acquirement of Godly duties from an angel.  It is the job of the family to hunt down and destroy demons.The movie that follows would be a very intense and interesting look into the way one father's insanity affects his young and impressionable children, and the damaging results that follow.  Instead it's actually a reinforcement of the father's own insanity, eventually leading itself to unnecessary and counter-intuitive plot twists that are camp when taken not seriously and preachy when taken seriously.Overall the general stylings of the film are okay.  The directing, acting, and cinematography are well-enough done, though the acting tends to shudder sometimes towards bad, especially during the end.

710469,A319YRDK8Y39N,B00006AUJR,"""qmlhcb""","[3, 5]","Frailty is a frightening film about a man's fall into religious fanaticism, and the devastation it causes for his children later in life.Bill Paxton plays the father of two young boys who one day believes an angel tells him the end of the world is coming, and he has to destroy demons in the disguise of humans. He enlists the help of his sons and goes on a killing spree.Scary? Yes, especially in this day and age of extreme cultists. This kind of thing happens in our world, and Frailty takes us right into the disturbing heart of the matter.Though this film isn't perfect, it still provides an excellent, chilling story. The acting is well done, in particular the young actor playing the eldest son Fenton. He skillfully plays a boy caught in the midst of his father's delusions and not wanting any part in it.Frailty made two major mistakes though. One is during the first half of the film, narration of one of the sons as an adult is so prevalent it becomes annoying. Most of the scenes can speak for themselves, and it ruins much of the natural tension. Fortunately the narration becomes more intermittent as the film progressives, and helps rather then hurts the film. Also, the ending builds up to become very ambiguous, then makes the truth more obvious in the final moments, ruining much of the terror the film could have left its audience with. Sometimes not being sure about something is more frightening then knowing the truth.But despite these flaws, Frailty is an excellent film any suspense or horror film love will embrace. It leaves you guessing what happens next; hoping for the best but preparing for the worst. Frailty is a great debut from director Bill Paxton. This one promises more good things from him in the future. But this film isn't for the weak at heart.

710470,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B00006AUJR,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[0, 2]","I'd never heard of 'Frailty' before I rented this DVD, and, wary as I am of renting movies I've never come across before (see my review of 'Fear of the Dark' for proof of that!!) I was hugely surprised and very impressed with this excellent 2002 offering starring the excellent Matthew McConaughey.The quiet family life of young brothers Fenton and Adam Mieks is turned upside down when their recently-widowed Father loses his mind, and begins to kidnap and execute what he believes are 'Demons', after an audience with an Angel. Cut to some years later, and the adult Fenton is recounting the tale to a police officer investigating the 'God's hand killer', whom Fenton believes to be his brother Adam.Pretty much a vehicle for Matthew McConaughey, 'Frailty' also contains some excellent performances from child actors Matthew O'Leary as the Young Fenton and Jeremy Sumpter as the young Adam.  For child actors they display a feeling for their roles far beyond their years, and it's their opposite reactions to their Father's insanity and misdeeds that give this excellent picture much of its credibility. Bill Paxton as Dad mieks is decent enough (he also directed the movie) but we can;t help feel that he doesn't give enough depth to the character of the psychopath.Direction, though, is first-rate, and shooting most of the movie at night creates an excellent contrast between the darkness of the murder-scenes and the garish bright of the daytime sequences. The actual murder scenes themselves are neither gory nor unnessecarily violent, and are all the more tense and enthralling because of it. Paxton seems to be a far superior director than he is actor, and he does an excellent job with this picture.There's a great twist in the tale, and while we are expecting a twist, it's not the one we were thinking of.All in all, 'Frailty' is an excellent, tense horror-cum-suspense movie, with some excellent performances and top-drawer direction.

710472,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00006AUJR,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 3]","Frailty (Bill Paxton, 2001)Given that Frailty is Bill Paxton's big-screen directorial debut, and his first trip behind the camera at all in almost twenty years, it's rather amazing how little press this movie actually got. The critics liked it overall, which is usually a bad sign, since the critics and the public agree on almost nothing. The advertising budget was woefully misused, and thus the film pretty much flopped when it came out (just over thirteen million on a budget of eleven). It's a shame.Frailty is billed as a mystery, and perhaps folks who haven't seen many mystery or horror films will buy into that; for anyone who's read more than one Agatha Christie novel, though, the ""surprise"" ending will be obvious within ten or fifteen minutes of the beginning of the film. (If you haven't seen it and are planning to, avoid IMDB.com, as well; it, too, gives away the twist. Don't blame them; it's unavoidable.) And this would have been a stronger work had Paxton and scriptwriter Brent Hanley not spent so much time on the twist and spent more on the film's real subject-an examination of genetic mental illness that is far more disturbing than the mystery itself.Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) is an FBI agent on the case of a serial killer known as God's Hands. One day, Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey) walks into Doyle's office, sits down, and says ""I know who the God's Hands killer is."" Offering proof, Meiks takes Doyle on a two and a half hour trip to where he claims the bodies are buried, and during the ride, Meiks tells Doyle how he knows that the God's Hands killer is his brother, Adam. The story he tells is the bulk of the film, told in flashback, when Fenton and Adam were much younger.Bill Paxton stars in the flashback as the Meiks' father, and it's his best screen role since Near Dark fifteen years previous. Dad is obviously nuts (as Fenton tells him repeatedly), but Adam is very much taken in by his father's beliefs that an angel is visiting him and telling him he's supposed to kill demons in human form. All three principal players in the flashbacks (Paxton, Matthew O'Leary [Domestic Disturbance] as Fenton, and Jeremy Sumpter [Adaptation, Peter Pan] in his big-screen debut as Adam) are so convincing in their roles that after a while, the viewer starts to wonder if maybe Fenton's the one who's nuts.Fans of the atmospheric thriller will find much to enjoy here. Paxton keeps the blood to a minimum given the subject matter (one thinks that if Boothe and one minor character hadn't each used what Jean Shepherd called ""the F dash dash dash word,"" the movie would have been solidly in PG-13 territory), and the pace is far more in tune with movies like The Others than it is with your typical Van Damme movie. And while you'll probably get the main question figured out early on, you'll find yourself with many questions about the Meiks family, and you will have them long after the film ends.A very good debut. *** ",4,"Not really a mystery, but still worthwhile",1036972800,"11 11, 2002",2002,2958,"['Frailty', 'Bill', 'Paxton', '2001', 'Given', 'Frailty', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'big-screen', 'directorial', 'debut', 'first', 'trip', 'camera', 'almost', 'twenty', 'years', 'rather', 'amazing', 'how', 'little', 'press', 'movie', 'actually', 'got', 'critics', 'liked', 'overall', 'usually', 'bad', 'sign', 'critics', 'public', 'agree', 'almost', 'nothing', 'advertising', 'budget', 'was', 'woefully', 'misused', 'thus', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'flopped', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'just', 'thirteen', 'million', 'budget', 'eleven', 'shame.Frailty', 'billed', 'mystery', 'perhaps', 'folks', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'mystery', 'horror', 'films', 'will', 'buy', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'more', 'one', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'novel', 'though', 'surprise', 'ending', 'will', 'be', 'obvious', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'beginning', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'are', 'planning', 'avoid', 'IMDB.com', 'as', 'well', 'too', 'away', 'twist', 'Do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'unavoidable', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'work', 'had', 'Paxton', 'scriptwriter', 'Brent', 'Hanley', 'not', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'twist', 'spent', 'more', 'film', 'real', 'subject-an', 'examination', 'genetic', 'mental', 'illness', 'far', 'more', 'disturbing', 'mystery', 'itself.Wesley', 'Doyle', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'FBI', 'agent', 'case', 'serial', 'killer', 'known', 'God', 'Hands', 'One', 'day', 'Fenton', 'Meiks', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Doyle', 'office', 'down', 'know', 'who', 'God', 'Hands', 'killer', 'Offering', 'proof', 'Meiks', 'Doyle', 'two', 'half', 'hour', 'trip', 'where', 'bodies', 'are', 'buried', 'ride', 'Meiks', 'Doyle', 'how', 'God', 'Hands', 'killer', 'brother', 'Adam', 'story', 'bulk', 'film', 'told', 'flashback', 'when', 'Fenton', 'Adam', 'were', 'much', 'younger.Bill', 'Paxton', 'stars', 'flashback', 'Meiks', 'father', 'best', 'screen', 'role', 'Near', 'Dark', 'fifteen', 'years', 'previous', 'Dad', 'obviously', 'nuts', 'Fenton', 'repeatedly', 'Adam', 'very', 'much', 'taken', 'father', 'beliefs', 'angel', 'visiting', 'telling', 'supposed', 'kill', 'demons', 'human', 'form', 'three', 'principal', 'players', 'flashbacks', 'Paxton', 'Matthew', ""O'Leary"", '[', 'Domestic', 'Disturbance', ']', 'Fenton', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', '[', 'Adaptation', 'Peter', 'Pan', ']', 'big-screen', 'debut', 'Adam', 'are', 'so', 'convincing', 'roles', 'while', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'maybe', 'Fenton', 'one', 'who', 'nuts.Fans', 'atmospheric', 'thriller', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'enjoy', 'here', 'Paxton', 'blood', 'minimum', 'given', 'subject', 'matter', 'one', 'Boothe', 'one', 'minor', 'character', 'had', ""n't"", 'used', 'what', 'Jean', 'Shepherd', 'called', 'F', 'dash', 'dash', 'dash', 'word', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'solidly', 'PG-13', 'territory', 'pace', 'far', 'more', 'tune', 'movies', 'Others', 'typical', 'Van', 'Damme', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'get', 'main', 'question', 'figured', 'out', 'early', ""'ll"", 'find', 'many', 'questions', 'Meiks', 'family', 'will', 'have', 'long', 'film', 'ends.A', 'very', 'good', 'debut', '***']",Frailty
710473,AW3FTPCBPVQNB,B00006AUJR,Robert J. Schneider,"[0, 2]","There is no one word to describe Bill Paxton's FRAILTY (2002), his directorial debut.  All three of the above words apply to this tantalizing, amazing film--the most amazing fact is that this IS Bill Paxton's directorial debut.  This movie is so well crafted with a master's artistic hand that you would swear that a suspense veteran such as Brian De Palma (CARRIE, OBSESSION), Ridley Scott (ALIEN), Barbet Schroeder (SINGLE WHITE FEMALE) or Taylor Hackford (THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE) had directed it.  I personally cannot wait to review Mr. Paxton's next film; I'm sure that it will be different, but great nonetheless.FRAILTY itself is different--a very different kind of movie.  It begins by being told in a conventional manner, via the flashback technique.  In fact, it sets the story up so conventionally that we fall rather easily for the direction in which Paxton takes us.  This film successfully manipulates us to believe that the story is heading in one particular way.  By the end, we've been duped, and duped so brilliantly that we had never seen it coming to us in the first place.FRAILTY is regarded as a horror/suspense thriller.  If this film has to be categorized, then this would probably be the most accurate label to put on it.  If you're reading this far, you undoubtably know that it is about religious fanaticism and the violent acts resulting from it.  You know that it concerns Bill Paxton as a Texas &quot;Dad&quot; (who is, interestingly enough, never named in the film, another tactic of artistic brilliance on the part of Brent Hanley, who wrote the film's screenplay) who awakens his two young sons in the middle of an otherwise ordinary night and breathlessly tells them of a &quot;revelation from a heavenly angel&quot; about what they &quot;now must do&quot; in the name of &quot;God's work.&quot;  What they &quot;now must do&quot; involves killing &quot;demons in human form&quot; by way of decaptitation via the axe.The family last name is &quot;Meiks&quot; (which phonetically sounds like &quot;meek&quot;--I wonder if the film's title relates to that?), and the two sons, Fenton and Adam (ages 12 and 9, respectively) are now left to take this information all in.  The younger one does, the older one doesn't--in fact, he believes that Dad has just flipped, as he had apparently never been much of a religious man and, besides, this plan to &quot;rid the world of demons&quot; sounds just plain crazy.  However, the axe-slayings do begin to occur; one son goes along willingly and the other tries to resist as best as he possibly can.You know all of the above by now.  But if you think that this is all of what FRAILTY is about, then you don't even know the half of it.  This brilliant film has more twists and turns that you could shake a Magnolia stick at; however, these twists/turns are handled with a maximum of subtlety and with a minimum of incredulity.The acting performances of all of the principals are genuine, and never step wrongly even once.  Bill Paxton walks an incredibly fine line of portraying a character who remains sympathetic even as he is systematically decapitating those he believes are not human beings, but demons.  Matthew O'Leary does an excellent job of portraying the elder Meiks child as emotionally conflicted between the love of his father and the hatred for what it is he's doing.  Jeremy Sumpter creates a perfect counter-foil as the younger, more impressionable and believing son for whom this murderous rampage either makes total sense, or he is simply following the wishes of his father.  But it us Matthew McConaughey's performance that is the most memorable; it is an absolute outrage that he did not receive a nomination for Best Supporting Actor in this role, the most enigmatic of his career.Lastly, it is the screenplay by Brent Hanley and direction by Bill Paxton that are the real stars of the film; inded, this movie should have received Oscar nominations in both categories, and for Best Picture, to boot.  It is just another example of unfair bias against the horror/suspense genre; that a film of markedly greater quality than most of the overblown and overrated dramas that are usually honored becomes lost in the Hollywood shuffle of the Holiday Season.  It's too bad, because most of the axemurders depicted in this film are offscreen; indeed, what is most palpable in each and every scene (and, ultimately, more horrifying) is the *psychological* horror involved in the telling of this story.  It is a story that is totally believable; indeed, it is amazing to my mind that it does not even claim to have been based on a true story!  It is also a story that is emotionally draining.  Finally, it is a story that is so well-told that it makes you reflect on it for a good long time afterwards.MOST RECOMMENDED",5,"Chilling, thoughtful and disturbing.",1066867200,"10 23, 2003",2003,4798,"['one', 'word', 'describe', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'FRAILTY', '2002', 'directorial', 'debut', 'three', 'above', 'words', 'apply', 'tantalizing', 'amazing', 'film', 'most', 'amazing', 'fact', 'IS', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'directorial', 'debut', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'crafted', 'master', 'artistic', 'hand', 'would', 'swear', 'suspense', 'veteran', 'such', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'CARRIE', 'OBSESSION', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'ALIEN', 'Barbet', 'Schroeder', 'SINGLE', 'WHITE', 'FEMALE', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'THE', 'DEVIL', 'ADVOCATE', 'had', 'directed', 'personally', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'review', 'Mr.', 'Paxton', 'next', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'different', 'great', 'nonetheless.FRAILTY', 'different', 'very', 'different', 'kind', 'movie', 'being', 'told', 'conventional', 'manner', 'flashback', 'technique', 'fact', 'story', 'up', 'so', 'conventionally', 'fall', 'rather', 'easily', 'direction', 'Paxton', 'film', 'successfully', 'believe', 'story', 'heading', 'one', 'particular', 'way', 'end', ""'ve"", 'been', 'duped', 'duped', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'coming', 'first', 'place.FRAILTY', 'regarded', 'horror/suspense', 'thriller', 'film', 'be', 'categorized', 'then', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'most', 'accurate', 'label', 'put', ""'re"", 'reading', 'far', 'undoubtably', 'know', 'about', 'religious', 'fanaticism', 'violent', 'acts', 'resulting', 'know', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'Texas', 'quot', 'Dad', 'quot', 'who', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'never', 'named', 'film', 'tactic', 'artistic', 'brilliance', 'part', 'Brent', 'Hanley', 'who', 'wrote', 'film', 'screenplay', 'who', 'two', 'young', 'sons', 'middle', 'otherwise', 'ordinary', 'night', 'breathlessly', 'quot', 'revelation', 'heavenly', 'angel', 'quot', 'what', 'quot', 'now', 'must', 'do', 'quot', 'name', 'quot', 'God', 'work.', 'quot', 'What', 'quot', 'now', 'must', 'do', 'quot', 'killing', 'quot', 'demons', 'human', 'form', 'quot', 'way', 'decaptitation', 'axe.The', 'family', 'last', 'name', 'quot', 'Meiks', 'quot', 'phonetically', 'quot', 'quot', 'wonder', 'film', 'title', 'two', 'sons', 'Fenton', 'Adam', '12', '9', 'respectively', 'are', 'now', 'left', 'take', 'information', 'younger', 'one', 'older', 'one', ""n't"", 'fact', 'Dad', 'just', 'flipped', 'had', 'apparently', 'never', 'been', 'much', 'religious', 'man', 'besides', 'plan', 'quot', 'rid', 'world', 'demons', 'quot', 'just', 'plain', 'crazy', 'However', 'axe-slayings', 'do', 'begin', 'occur', 'one', 'son', 'along', 'willingly', 'other', 'tries', 'resist', 'as', 'best', 'possibly', 'can.You', 'know', 'above', 'now', 'think', 'what', 'FRAILTY', 'about', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'half', 'brilliant', 'film', 'more', 'twists', 'could', 'shake', 'Magnolia', 'stick', 'however', 'twists/turns', 'are', 'handled', 'maximum', 'subtlety', 'minimum', 'incredulity.The', 'acting', 'performances', 'principals', 'are', 'genuine', 'never', 'step', 'wrongly', 'even', 'once', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'incredibly', 'fine', 'line', 'portraying', 'character', 'who', 'sympathetic', 'even', 'systematically', 'decapitating', 'are', 'not', 'human', 'beings', 'demons', 'Matthew', ""O'Leary"", 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'elder', 'Meiks', 'child', 'emotionally', 'conflicted', 'love', 'father', 'hatred', 'what', 'doing', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', 'perfect', 'counter-foil', 'younger', 'more', 'impressionable', 'believing', 'son', 'whom', 'murderous', 'rampage', 'total', 'sense', 'simply', 'following', 'wishes', 'father', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'performance', 'most', 'memorable', 'absolute', 'outrage', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'role', 'most', 'enigmatic', 'career.Lastly', 'screenplay', 'Brent', 'Hanley', 'direction', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'are', 'real', 'stars', 'film', 'inded', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'categories', 'Best', 'Picture', 'boot', 'just', 'example', 'unfair', 'bias', 'horror/suspense', 'genre', 'film', 'markedly', 'greater', 'quality', 'most', 'overblown', 'overrated', 'dramas', 'are', 'usually', 'honored', 'lost', 'Hollywood', 'shuffle', 'Holiday', 'Season', 'too', 'bad', 'most', 'axemurders', 'depicted', 'film', 'are', 'offscreen', 'indeed', 'what', 'most', 'palpable', 'scene', 'ultimately', 'more', 'horrifying', '*psychological*', 'horror', 'involved', 'telling', 'story', 'story', 'totally', 'believable', 'indeed', 'amazing', 'mind', 'not', 'even', 'claim', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'also', 'story', 'emotionally', 'draining', 'Finally', 'story', 'so', 'well-told', 'reflect', 'good', 'long', 'time', 'afterwards.MOST', 'RECOMMENDED']",Frailty

710476,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00006AUJR,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 3]","***1/2 Sometimes the sign of a great talent lies not so much in what an artist does, but in what he chooses NOT to do.  This is the case with Bill Paxton, whose ""Frailty"" marks his debut as a director of extraordinary promise and note.  Paxton begins with a story that could easily have served as the basis for just another cheap exploitation picture, just another slasher film filled with gruesome carnage, senseless violence and inane stereotypes and clich&eacute;s.  Instead, Paxton has utilized intelligence and restraint to turn his project into that rarest of cinematic commodities: a ""thinking man's"" thriller, a breed almost unheard of in this day and age when unbridled excess and smash-and-grab sensationalism are the too-familiar hallmarks of the horror movie genre.Written by Brent Hanley, ""Frailty"" is a chilling tale of madness and murder, a horror story more concerned with character and tone than with mayhem and bloodshed (though there is certainly some of that in the film as well).  Paxton plays ""Dad"" Meiks, a blue-collar widower with two young sons, who late one night in 1979 experiences what he believes is a vision from God, informing Meiks that he has been set apart for a special purpose:  to root out and destroy the ""demons"" who have infiltrated this world unnoticed, hidden in the guise of ordinary people.  As the Lord's specially appointed Avenging Angel, Meiks, with the help of his sons, sets off on his mission, searching out and brutally eliminating numerous people whose identities have been ""supernaturally"" revealed to him.The story is told from the viewpoint of Meiks' older son, Fenton, played by Matthew O'Leary as a child, and by Matthew McConaughey, as an adult (at least ostensibly).  The film is framed in the form of a flashback, with a disturbed ""Fenton"" coming forth at long last to unburden himself to the authorities, in this case Agent Wesley Doyle, played by Powers Boothe.  As ""Fenton"" reveals the intricate details of the case, a gripping tale of the power of insanity and of filial love and commitment emerges.  It would be unfair to reveal the surprise twist at the end that puts an entirely new spin on the story we have been watching.  Suffice it to say that it succeeds in making us rethink every single detail of the film in an entirely different light.  The result is that the film haunts us for days after seeing it.Unlike most filmmakers working in this genre - who mistakenly believe that terror is achieved in direct proportion to how over-the-top one can get - Paxton understands that the greatest horror is the one rooted in the mundane realities of everyday life.  It is only when those realities suddenly twist themselves into unfamiliar and unsettling shapes and forms that true bloodcurdling terror occurs. Young Fenton, in particular, has his safe, happy world shattered the moment his father bursts into his room in the middle of the night to reveal his macabre plan.  From then on, Fenton's existence becomes a waking nightmare, as he has to live with the gruesome reality of what his father is doing.  Yet on the surface, life appears to go on with an air of banal normality, a disturbing tone Paxton exploits to maximum effect.  In fact, the sheer matter-of-fact way in which Paxton tells his story is what makes the movie so unsettling.The performances are excellent, particularly by O'Leary, as the bewildered young boy who loves his father dearly but who simply cannot reconcile and countenance the incomprehensible and grisly acts he sees him performing.  In subtle strokes, this superb young actor reveals the terrifying helplessness that occurs when rational goodness goes up against the implacable force of an unreasoning, twisted mind.  Jeremy Sumpter also does a fine job as Adam, Fenton's younger brother, who seems less resistant to his father's mad ranting than does Fenton.

It focuses on Bill Paxton and his two sons, his wife has recently passed away and he is left to raise them. For me, Bill Paxton ranks in the Mel Gibson arena of likeability, meaning he's very likeable. The story takes place in Alabama or one of it's neighboring states and begins by showing what a straight, honest man Bill Paxton's character is.His family seems to be very close-knit and you just want to cheer for them. All this changes one day when Bill Paxton's character sees &quot;an angel&quot; from God. The angel gives him a list of &quot;Demons&quot;that he has to destroy. When he comes home that day he tells his sons what he's heard. His younger son believes him but the older son begins to think that his father is crazy.Throughout, this movie was genuinely captivating.I had heard that 'Frailty' had a whopper twist at it's end and it does. Although I had guessed the conclusion long before it had unfolded. There is great acting all around with very notable performances by the two younger boys.Nearly everything about this movie works until the last half hour,then it all falls apart.

710482,A3TDJYEQCXG1DA,B00006AUJR,Sera69,"[0, 1]","This is a fine movie, heavily reminiscent of theThe Usual Suspectsfor set-up and d&eacute;nouement. Bill Paxton is to be commended on producing such an inventive first feature. Unfortunately I also found it lacking in structure with a botched, haphazard ending that could have been handled much more successfully.The premise is quite stark: A widowed father claims to have been given a vision and mission from God to destroy demons; people he believes God has told him are evil. Suddenly the lives of his two children are thrown into chaos. The older child refutes utterly his fathers calling, claiming him to be nothing but a murderer, but the younger boy is a believer.The story is told in flash back by the older child, now grown up to an FBI officer, in a similar play to that followed in the Usual Suspects. As the story unfolds a definite empathy builds for the horrific situation the older boy finds himself in; is his father having visions or is he just a serial killer? And there are several heart-stopping moments of drama and genuine shock.This part of the movie works well and, despite the grimness of the story and situation, is quite gripping. Unfortunately, I also feel this method of storytelling, flash-back, is detrimental to the flow of the film. The beginning and middle, concentrating on the Father and two boys, would have benefited from a continuous, monologue free, presentation. The interview of the now grown older child coming only at the end of the drama he faced as a boy, and only as he is with the FBI officer in the car being driven back to his Fathers old house.That ending too suffers from feeling slightly rushed. The reveal, the secrets, could have been held right until almost the last two or three scenes. Instead the twist is explained away in a shockingly bad ""now I shall reveal everything"" type speech by the bad guy to the FBI agent. It's clunky at best, yet would need only a minimal rewrite to have kept the tension and reveal until the very end, giving it a genuine Usual Suspects level of twist.Despite my qualms this is a great film and recommended for fans of films likeThe Sixth Sense,Se7enand the aforementioned Usual Suspects. It's dramatic and exciting, psychologically scary rather than overloaded with blood and gore and has enough tension and thrills, and a great final twist, to make further viewings worthwhile and rewarding.",4,"Assured first feature, psychologically scary but does feel rushed.",1297123200,"02 8, 2011",2011,2383,"['fine', 'movie', 'heavily', 'reminiscent', 'theThe', 'Usual', 'Suspectsfor', 'set-up', 'd', 'eacute', 'nouement', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'be', 'commended', 'producing', 'such', 'inventive', 'first', 'feature', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'found', 'lacking', 'structure', 'botched', 'haphazard', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'much', 'more', 'successfully.The', 'premise', 'quite', 'stark', 'widowed', 'father', 'claims', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'vision', 'mission', 'God', 'destroy', 'demons', 'people', 'God', 'told', 'are', 'evil', 'Suddenly', 'lives', 'two', 'children', 'are', 'thrown', 'chaos', 'older', 'child', 'utterly', 'fathers', 'calling', 'claiming', 'be', 'nothing', 'murderer', 'younger', 'boy', 'believer.The', 'story', 'told', 'flash', 'back', 'older', 'child', 'now', 'up', 'FBI', 'officer', 'similar', 'play', 'followed', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'story', 'definite', 'empathy', 'builds', 'horrific', 'situation', 'older', 'boy', 'finds', 'father', 'having', 'visions', 'just', 'serial', 'killer', 'are', 'several', 'heart-stopping', 'moments', 'drama', 'genuine', 'shock.This', 'part', 'movie', 'well', 'grimness', 'story', 'situation', 'quite', 'gripping', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'feel', 'method', 'storytelling', 'flash-back', 'detrimental', 'flow', 'film', 'beginning', 'middle', 'concentrating', 'Father', 'two', 'boys', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'continuous', 'monologue', 'free', 'presentation', 'interview', 'now', 'grown', 'older', 'child', 'coming', 'only', 'end', 'drama', 'faced', 'boy', 'only', 'FBI', 'officer', 'car', 'being', 'driven', 'back', 'Fathers', 'old', 'house.That', 'ending', 'too', 'suffers', 'feeling', 'slightly', 'rushed', 'reveal', 'secrets', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'held', 'right', 'almost', 'last', 'two', 'three', 'scenes', 'Instead', 'twist', 'explained', 'away', 'shockingly', 'bad', 'now', 'shall', 'reveal', 'everything', 'type', 'speech', 'bad', 'guy', 'FBI', 'agent', 'clunky', 'best', 'yet', 'would', 'need', 'only', 'minimal', 'rewrite', 'have', 'kept', 'tension', 'reveal', 'very', 'end', 'giving', 'genuine', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'level', 'twist.Despite', 'qualms', 'great', 'film', 'recommended', 'fans', 'films', 'likeThe', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Se7enand', 'aforementioned', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'dramatic', 'exciting', 'psychologically', 'scary', 'rather', 'overloaded', 'blood', 'gore', 'enough', 'tension', 'thrills', 'great', 'final', 'twist', 'make', 'further', 'viewings', 'worthwhile', 'rewarding']",Frailty

The MPAA gave it an R rating, but after viewing I don't see any reason why it shouldn't be a tamer PG-13. It seems to have been slapped with the R more for its controversy than its content.Frailty is certainly not a Horror movie, which is the label that it seems to have gotten here and there since its 2001 release. It's really a psychological thriller about a father (Bill Paxton) that has an epiphany and believes that God has chosen his family of 3 to be The Hands that hunt down and kill demons that have taken human form. Now that sounds like a Horror movie, but the demons that are hunted aren't traditional Horror movie boogyman/vampire demons. They're people.The film gives you the perspective that you're seeing a serial killer born and takes you through how the killer, right from the get-go, gets his two young sons involved in his heinous criminal intent.Has God commissioned a man named Meiks (Paxton) as a Holy Vigilante to track down people that had done bad things or has Meiks simply gone mad? One of Meiks' sons believes the former and the other the latter. But both are forced by their father to help carry out ""justice"".The story is very well done and also Directed by Paxton. Matthew McConaughey stars and does a great job. But the real star is young (at the time age 14) Matt O'Leary (Brick [2005] & Havoc [2005]). O'Leary plays the brother that thinks his Dad has gone gaga.Brent Hanley wrote this excellent thriller with his only other credit being a Showtime Masters of Horror, John Landis directed, episode called Family where mom and dad execute vigilante justice. So it seems that Hanley's got a knack for families that bond by killing.The film moves along at a quick clip. It's suspenseful and has some decent twists. The Powers Booth portrayed FBI agent takes some imagination stretching, but otherwise Frailty is well worth renting.",4,God's Hands,1168214400,"01 8, 2007",2007,2207,"['What', 'sleeper', 'Frailty', 'apparently', 'was', 'suggest', 'simply', ""'d"", 'not', 'even', 'heard', 'was', 'recommended', 'Amazon', 'based', 'other', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'purchased', 'reviewed.And', 'wonder', 'Frailty', 'was', 'somewhat', 'controversial', 'religion', 'kids', 'serial', 'killers', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'objections', 'content', 'MPAA', 'gave', 'R', 'rating', 'viewing', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'reason', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'tamer', 'PG-13', 'have', 'been', 'slapped', 'R', 'more', 'controversy', 'content.Frailty', 'certainly', 'not', 'Horror', 'movie', 'label', 'have', 'gotten', 'here', 'there', '2001', 'release', 'really', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'father', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'epiphany', 'God', 'chosen', 'family', '3', 'be', 'Hands', 'hunt', 'down', 'kill', 'demons', 'have', 'taken', 'human', 'form', 'Now', 'Horror', 'movie', 'demons', 'are', 'hunted', 'are', ""n't"", 'traditional', 'Horror', 'movie', 'boogyman/vampire', 'demons', ""'re"", 'people.The', 'film', 'perspective', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'serial', 'killer', 'born', 'how', 'killer', 'right', 'get-go', 'two', 'young', 'sons', 'involved', 'heinous', 'criminal', 'intent.Has', 'God', 'commissioned', 'man', 'named', 'Meiks', 'Paxton', 'Holy', 'Vigilante', 'track', 'down', 'people', 'had', 'done', 'bad', 'things', 'Meiks', 'simply', 'gone', 'mad', 'One', 'Meiks', 'sons', 'former', 'other', 'latter', 'are', 'forced', 'father', 'help', 'carry', 'out', 'justice', '.The', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'also', 'Directed', 'Paxton', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'stars', 'great', 'job', 'real', 'star', 'young', 'time', 'age', '14', 'Matt', ""O'Leary"", 'Brick', '[', '2005', ']', 'Havoc', '[', '2005', ']', ""O'Leary"", 'brother', 'Dad', 'gone', 'gaga.Brent', 'Hanley', 'wrote', 'excellent', 'thriller', 'only', 'other', 'credit', 'being', 'Showtime', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'John', 'Landis', 'directed', 'episode', 'called', 'Family', 'where', 'mom', 'dad', 'execute', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'Hanley', 'got', 'knack', 'families', 'bond', 'killing.The', 'film', 'moves', 'along', 'quick', 'clip', 'suspenseful', 'decent', 'twists', 'Powers', 'Booth', 'portrayed', 'FBI', 'agent', 'imagination', 'stretching', 'otherwise', 'Frailty', 'well', 'worth', 'renting']",Frailty

I won't ruin it for those that haven't seen it, but it will twist your mind a thousand ways. After the first time I saw it, I just sat there. I didn't know what to make of it.Most know the plot of the movie. Bill Paxton plays ""Dad"" (we never know his name). He wakes his two sons up telling them that God told him to kill all the ""demons"". ""Dad"" rationalizes it saying that killing people is wrong, but since he's killing demons, it isn't wrong. ""Adam"", the youngest son believes his father, while ""Fenton"", the oldest son is hestiant about the whole thing and thinks his father has lost it.Matthew McConaughey tells this FBI agent played by Powers Boothe that his brother, Adam, is the God's Hand killer. The story is told in flashbacks by Fenton (McConaughey).The twist is that you start to think that maybe, just maybe the father isn't all that crazy.I hate to say anymore, but Matthew McConaughey is awesome. This is one of the best roles of his career. I want to say why, but let's just say, I would like to see him in more ""not nice"" roles.Even after you watch this movie more than once and you know the surprise, it will still leave you with your mind all twisted up!!I'm also disappointed this movie didn't get as much attention,  but who's to say the bigger movies are better.

Not just the story, mind you, but the whole presentation from beginning to end. I'm sure many of you have read the other reviews, so I won't repeat what's already been said, but this is a movie that is a definite classic and will hopefully be re-released at full length.I've recently been going over the whole genre on film with notables like 'The Exorcist - The version you've never seen', 'From Hell' and 'Near Dark' (another Bill Paxton masterpiece), `Frailty' is quite possibly the Exorcist of this decade. I say this for the following reasons:1. As dark as the movie was and shocking in places, after listening to the writer's commentary and Paxton's commentary (something I've never done before), they actually cut a lot of footage out that might have sent it to the outer bounds of Film Noir, which is actually something I would've liked to have seen, but was cut for the concern of it being ""too shocking."" A movie that's too shocking?, wow! The commentaries are excellent and well worth the multiple viewings and give so much insight to this movie that it's astounding.2. The responsibility of thinking is placed in the viewers lap and is not drawn out for you as though you were a simpleton and couldn't grasp basic moral and story / plot concepts, I really appreciated this. It's very evident in watching Fenton become more and more like a demon.3. The narration by Matthew McConaughey is very worthy, unlike many other film narrations.4. Bill Paxton's characterization of the 'Texas father' is dead on. It's jaw dropping to watch him carry on like that.

The father along with his two sons will hunt down demons and destroy (not kill!) them.After destroying their first demon (who looks just like a human) the younger son is on board with the mission, the older son rebels and thinks his father is loony. The father punishes the older son for his own good, he wants the older boy to get on board with their mission to kill demons.As the flim opens, one of the sons (now grown up) contacts the FBI as the other son has become a serial killer.At the end there is a twist that took me completely by surprise.The film is creepy and violent, but the violence is mostly implied.

710491,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00006AUJR,Steven Reynolds,"[1, 2]","This is a highly original and thought-provoking piece which, in terms of its story, sits somewhere between Stephen King and Jorge Luis Borges. That's a very good starting point, so it's slightly disappointing that it's partly undermined by a repetitive screenplay (just how many times do characters need to state their positions on God's will?) which relies too heavily on voiceover narration. While it's true that McConaughey's character is literally telling the story for most of the film, his insistent voiceover yanks us out of the moment and dilutes the tension. And in general, it isn't required: Paxton gets such good performances from the kids that we don't need to be told what's going on inside their heads - we can see it on their faces. Imaginative viewers might predict a few of the plot turns, but the story never reveals where it's headed too soon. And while Act 3 does employ the twist-laden high jinks which cap most thrillers, it doesn't resort to explaining every last detail of what you've seen. Writer Brent Hanley and director Paxton have the sense and the confidence to leave things with an appealing ambiguity which helps maintain the unsettling tone to the end.

710496,A22QPZWME85Z8T,B00006AUJR,"Timothy Hammond ""Movie Geek""","[7, 20]","Frailty is the type of suspense/psychological thriller that relies heavily on a surprising plot twist to make it stand out in a genre that is usually over saturated each year.  If done well, this type of film leaves a lasting impression and usually develops quite a fan base, the prime example being The Usual Suspects.  By placing so much emphasis on the plot twist or surprise ending though, the film effectively &quot;puts all its eggs in one basket&quot;, so to speak.  The surprise ending therefore must not only be excellent, but must also be able to stand up to scrutiny from viewers who will attempt to punch holes in the plot.Frailty is based on a very promising and intriguing, albeit unoriginal, concept.  The film presents a killer who takes the lives of sinners in God's name, then blurs the lines between whether or not that killer is actually justified in his actions.  The premise itself certainly raises questions, sparks debate, and provokes thought on the part of the viewer, all of which are aspects of good filmmaking.  However, this idea has already been explored and presented much better in the film Seven.The area in which Frailty really suffers though is at its very heart, its surprise ending.  The film does a good job of leading the viewer down one path and then completely turning around and catching the viewer off guard, but the twist seems forced and rushed, and we are left with very little evidence to strengthen its plausibility.  The film expects its viewers to accept much of its plot twist on faith alone, which is ironic and clever, considering much of the film deals with faith, though I doubt it is intentional.  In the end, the surprise ending of Frailty, and therefore the entire film, does not pack enough punch to remain nearly as memorable as many other movies based upon similar formulas.",2,"Promising, but ultimately average",1053388800,"05 20, 2003",2003,1836,"['Frailty', 'type', 'suspense/psychological', 'thriller', 'heavily', 'surprising', 'plot', 'twist', 'make', 'stand', 'out', 'genre', 'usually', 'saturated', 'year', 'done', 'well', 'type', 'film', 'lasting', 'impression', 'usually', 'quite', 'fan', 'base', 'prime', 'example', 'being', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'placing', 'so', 'much', 'emphasis', 'plot', 'twist', 'surprise', 'ending', 'film', 'effectively', 'quot', 'eggs', 'one', 'basket', 'quot', 'speak', 'surprise', 'ending', 'therefore', 'must', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'excellent', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'able', 'stand', 'up', 'scrutiny', 'viewers', 'who', 'will', 'attempt', 'punch', 'holes', 'plot.Frailty', 'based', 'very', 'promising', 'intriguing', 'albeit', 'unoriginal', 'concept', 'film', 'killer', 'who', 'lives', 'sinners', 'God', 'name', 'then', 'lines', 'not', 'killer', 'actually', 'justified', 'actions', 'premise', 'certainly', 'questions', 'sparks', 'debate', 'provokes', 'thought', 'part', 'viewer', 'are', 'aspects', 'good', 'filmmaking', 'However', 'idea', 'already', 'been', 'explored', 'presented', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'Seven.The', 'area', 'Frailty', 'really', 'though', 'very', 'heart', 'surprise', 'ending', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'leading', 'viewer', 'down', 'one', 'path', 'then', 'completely', 'turning', 'around', 'catching', 'viewer', 'guard', 'twist', 'forced', 'rushed', 'are', 'left', 'very', 'little', 'evidence', 'strengthen', 'plausibility', 'film', 'viewers', 'accept', 'much', 'plot', 'twist', 'faith', 'alone', 'ironic', 'clever', 'considering', 'much', 'film', 'deals', 'faith', 'doubt', 'intentional', 'end', 'surprise', 'ending', 'Frailty', 'therefore', 'entire', 'film', 'not', 'pack', 'enough', 'punch', 'remain', 'nearly', 'as', 'memorable', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'based', 'similar', 'formulas']",Frailty

Anyway, a friend of mine recommended this to me (thanks again, Captain!), and I caught it about two weeks ago.Now, I probably should have reviewed this about two weeks ago, but this movie is so powerful, it's STILL fresh in my mind. If you don't know about the plot, it's about the ""God's Hand Killer"", a father of two played by Bill Paxton, and his two sons. The father gets a religious epiphany that God has chosen him to kill off ""demons"" living among humans in the world, so that the world will be a safer place. Whether or not they were real ""demons"" or just evil human beings, I can't quite recall. Either way, this movie is TWISTED!What makes this movie so great? Well, it's just incredibly well-written, lots of stunning twists in the plot that you couldn't see if you had the telescope at your local science hall. The acting is also superb. I must admit, I was a little doubtful when I saw big name actors like Paxton and Matthew McConaughey. Not entirely sure why I was doubtful, I just thought getting commercially successful actors in a horror film, a genre that isn't all that commercial (thank goodness!), wouldn't work.But, THIS MOVIE DOES WORK! It's an intelligent, gripping, psychotically limitless exploitation of a madman. It's almost like getting a first-hand view of what drives a murderer. Bone-chilling stuff, ain't it?The movie also has a Southern feel, since it is set in the South, and there's something about a Southern feel to movies that just appeals to me.Well, if you like psychological horror or are a fan of either Bill Paxton or Matthew McConaughey, this is a movie that will blow your mind! It's a deranged look at what drives a maniac, and it's very realistic, and incredibly-well portrayed, so this IS a horror movie ESSENTIAL. Plus, the DVD comes with lots of extra, including the trailer and some commentary by Bill Paxton, who also wrote and, I think, directed this movie (proving that in real life, Paxton IS NOT a maniac! HA HA!) Anyway, this is a very highly recommended, chilling piece of psychological horror, one of the best to come in the last, ten years. It's as good as ""One Hour Photo"", entirely different than it, but still just as good. Ahhh, ""One Hour Photo"", THAT'S a movie I might get to soon.Anyway, hit the lights, grab some snapple and get ready to get freaked out and amazed at the same time, because ""Frailty"" does just that!

Most horror films are fairly B-grade, but Frailty is a well made film, with excellent acting and a nicely paced plot.  I would class it as a thriller movie.  An interesting theme about a father who receives a 'message' from God asking him to rid the earth of certain demons.  The father enlists the help of his young sons, willing or not, on his mission.  Surprise ending which perhaps puts a question mark over the father being a total nutcase.Matthew McGaughley plays the son retelling the story later in life.  This helps pace the film nicely and will keep you on the edge of your seat.  I wasn't expecting much to begin with, as I had almost given up on so called new horror and thriller films - but Frailty is a very enthralling, if not disturbing, film.  It made me think of two Christopher Walken fims ('At Close Range', and 'Dead Zone').  You'll see what I mean when you watch Frailty.DVD SUMMARY:Released by Paramount in Australia, the DVD has a nice 5.1 mix with great use of the subwoofer.
