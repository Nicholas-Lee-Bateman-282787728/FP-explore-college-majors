1036750,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000L2125O,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[1, 1]","`Open Season' does more than provide some oddball critters from ""the wild"".  With some spirited mischief and a fun-filled adventure, the film should be in sight for every family.  We are introduced to Boog (Martin Lawrence), a huge grizzly bear, whose domestication makes him spoiled for handouts.  Besides being a well-fed pet, his forest ranger owner, Beth (Debra Messing) keeps him young and harmless with her tender loving care.  His world changes when he meets another misfit animal, Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) whose high-strung nuerosis is solidified when he wakes up after being stunned when he was run over accidentally and tied to a truck.  That hunter, Shaw (Gary Sinise) however, may be a little more over the edge with a paranoid obsession with animals.  Acting like he has lived through Hitchcock's 'The Birds,' he becomes obsessed with shooting Elliot, whose connection to the animal kingdom he regards as conspiracy-like.With some crude potty humor and an animal survival war with ammunition that shouldn't be missed, `Open Season' presents a time for wide open laughs.  There are tender moments and good songs as well that don't spoil the adventure and give the trek some needed variety.  Included are an RV couple just about as loopy as animal lovers as the hunter is maniacal.  (Georgia Engel of `MTM' fame does the voice of wife Bobbie.)  The animation has some high definition that bring the forest and some chase scenes to life.  For a loopy treat, `Open Season' hit's the target.",3,Fun Family Film,1171324800,"02 13, 2007",2007,1498,"['Open', 'Season', 'more', 'provide', 'oddball', 'critters', 'wild', 'spirited', 'mischief', 'fun-filled', 'adventure', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'sight', 'family', 'are', 'introduced', 'Boog', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'huge', 'grizzly', 'bear', 'domestication', 'spoiled', 'handouts', 'being', 'well-fed', 'pet', 'forest', 'ranger', 'owner', 'Beth', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'young', 'harmless', 'tender', 'loving', 'care', 'world', 'changes', 'when', 'misfit', 'animal', 'Elliot', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'high-strung', 'nuerosis', 'solidified', 'when', 'up', 'being', 'stunned', 'when', 'was', 'run', 'accidentally', 'tied', 'truck', 'hunter', 'Shaw', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'however', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'edge', 'paranoid', 'obsession', 'animals', 'Acting', 'lived', 'Hitchcock', ""'The"", 'Birds', 'obsessed', 'shooting', 'Elliot', 'connection', 'animal', 'kingdom', 'conspiracy-like.With', 'crude', 'potty', 'humor', 'animal', 'survival', 'war', 'ammunition', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'missed', 'Open', 'Season', 'presents', 'time', 'wide', 'open', 'laughs', 'are', 'tender', 'moments', 'good', 'songs', 'as', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'adventure', 'give', 'trek', 'needed', 'variety', 'Included', 'are', 'RV', 'couple', 'just', 'about', 'as', 'loopy', 'animal', 'lovers', 'hunter', 'maniacal', 'Georgia', 'Engel', 'MTM', 'fame', 'voice', 'wife', 'Bobbie', 'animation', 'high', 'definition', 'bring', 'forest', 'chase', 'scenes', 'life', 'loopy', 'treat', 'Open', 'Season', 'hit', 'target']",N/A

He lives in her garage and does a show for the tourists. He's waiting out in her Jeep one day when he sees that the deer (Elliot) slung over the maniac hunter Shaw's truck hood is still alive, although he's had one antler broken off by Shaw's carelessness. So Boog cuts the ropes holding him on the hood and frees him.Elliot follows them home and discovers that Boog has this luxurious life in the garage. Plus he cannot go back to his herd with one antler, especially not since he was kicked out for flirting with the head deer's doe. In trying to convince Boog that they should be buddies, Elliot persuades him to go with him to a raid on the local supply store. It turns out sugar makes Boog stoned drunk, and he and Elliot get into all sorts of trouble from trashing the store.Sheriff Gordy convinces Beth that she must return Boog to the wild, and suggests she take him up above the waterfall, where he will be safe from hunters. Open season starts in just three days, and Beth is worried about Boog's safety.With Elliot to help him, as well as the other woodland creatures, Boog learns to do things the way nature does them -- including doing without the porcelain throne when he needs to take a crap. But the bunnies all want to watch, and a very annoyed skunk claims the bush he tries to use for a bathroom is her home.There's plenty of humor here, although most of it is probably meant to be for people young enough to find potty jokes funny. But there's a lot more, including some incredible imagination about the nature of various animals (check out the squirrel clan), and the weapons they employ to fight the hunters when they are swept down the falls to the lower meadows where the hunters come.

1036771,A278AF56R7J86,B000L2125O,"C. Crockett ""Domino713""","[1, 2]","This most recent addition to the ever widening genre of computer animated films featuring furry, fluffy critters who talk is (for the most part) a welcome addition.Quick Synopsis: Boog is a domesticated grizzly bear who has the misfortune of saving a young deer named Elliot from a psychotic hunter named Shaw. Thinking that was that, Boog returns to his comfortable home, only to discover that Elliot won't let him go! After convincing Boog that he needs to explore the world outside his comfortable pad, Elliot bumbles everything and Boog ends up banished to the wild during the start of open season for the hunters!This movie is, in a word, cute. It has several funny moments, and manages to hold your attention long enough to get through it. With an all-star cast voicing the characters, including Ashton Kutcher (Elliot), Martin Lawrence (Boog), Debra Messing (Beth), and Gary Sinese (Shaw), this movie has a lot going for it, including voice talent. Ashton Kutcher, by far, is the highlight of the movie. He injects so much charisma into the voice of Elliot, that he's easily the favorite of the film. Despite any possible misgivings as an actor that anyone might have about Kutcher, he is obviously cut out for animated voicing.The story itself is somewhat predictable, but that doesn't stop it from being enjoyable. The only other negative thing to say about this movie would be that it is unfortunately yet *another* computer animated film about animals that can talk. This particular genre, despite being fairly new, is getting burnt out pretty quickly on this type of story. How many more movies about talking animals can we take? Honestly?

1036773,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000L2125O,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 2]","If I learned anything from ""Open Season,"" it's that it's no fun being a wild animal. They have to deal with unpleasant elements everyday, such as predators and weather. Once every year, they have to protect themselves from ruthless hunters, each one looking for a new animal head to stuff and mount on the wall. In this case, it's even worse for rabbits. Not only do they have to worry about predators, weather, and hunters, they have to endure daily physical abuse, as well. There are many moments in this film when cute little bunnies are used for unsavory purposes; they're thrown at windows, used as towels, and even thrown at opponents in a game called Bunny Fight. It was darkly humorous at first, but after a while it became disturbing. I couldn't help but wonder if the rabbits were getting some kind of psychological payoff: they take each and every blow without even flinching (come to think of it, they don't even speak). What child would want to watch such unflattering violence, especially when the recipient seems to be enjoying it?This is but one of many questions I asked myself while watching this movie. It was a somewhat amusing cartoon, but it also seemed tired and worn out, as if it were telling a story that's been told a thousand times before. It can be argued that the same can be said for many other family-friendly films. To some extent, that would be correct: these kinds of stories (cartoons especially) tend to make use of traditional characters and predictable outcomes in order to be more appealing. Most of the time it isn't bothersome, even if the end result can be seen a mile away. However, such flaws are a little too prominent in ""Open Season,"" and that made watching it more of a sedating experience than an exhilarating one.It tells the story of Boog (Martin Lawrence), a pampered bear who lives with his owner, Beth (Debra Messing) in a remote mountain town. She's an adult scout who trains him to perform in front of a small cheering crowd, which usually involves him sitting an a unicycle. This isn't to say that he finds this degrading. Quite the opposite; he loves the life he's living, especially since it means being well-fed, sleeping on a soft bed every night, and having someone to sing him to sleep (""The Teddy Bear's Picnic"" no less). But then his world is turned upside down when he meet Elliot (Ashton Kutcher), whose first seen tied to the hood of a truck, apparently dead. When he comes to, he realizes that he was hit by that same truck, and it resulted in the loss of one of his antlers (""I'm half a doe, half a buck,"" he says. ""I'm a duck!"")After Boog sets Elliot free, he returns to Beth's house in an attempt to free Boog from captivity. The plan backfires; the two are caught after they break into a convenience store and run amok. Things continue to get worse when they meet again at one of Boog's performances. Feeling angry and betrayed for being put in a dangerous situation, Boog lashes out at Elliot. Unfortunately for the crowd, it looks as if an angry bear is ripping a harmless deer to shreds. Such an outburst forces Beth to release Boog back into the wild. For protection, he's placed high in the mountains, away from the dangerous hunting grounds. (It should be noted here that at this point in the story, open season is only two days away.)Once he realizes he's been dumped in the woods, Boog focuses only on trying to get back home. However, he quickly realizes that he's completely unprepared for the outside world; his sense of direction is lousy, his fish-hunting skills are minimal, and he just has to have access to a toilet as opposed to a bush. He's also unable to climb trees, not because he's physically incapable, but because a band of militant Scottish squirrels led by McSquizzy (Billy Connolly) refuse to let him. For whatever reason, they claim that they own all the trees in the forest. Such nasty little buggers; they certainly never give anyone a chance to explain their situation. On more than one occasion, they resort to assaulting trespassers with a barrage of pinecones and nuts.That alone is pretty trying for Boog. If there's to be any hope for a successful journey, he has no choice but to rely on Elliot, who claims to know the way back to town. Little do they know that the film's villain is hot on their trail. His name is Shaw (Gary Sinise), an incredibly creepy, trigger-happy hunter who has a vendetta against Boog for setting Elliot free. He quickly becomes less of a typical villain and more of a horrific paranoid psychotic. Basically, he blames Boog for turning the animals against him and for disrupting the ""natural order"" of things. Here's a character that does the movie more harm than good; younger audiences will probably be scared of him. And rightfully so. There's a scene when Boog stumbles into his cabin during a dark rainstorm. The inside is a genuine house of horrors, with chairs made of antlers and decapitated animal heads mounted on the wall.As the film progresses, Boog and Ellliot meet several animal characters, all of which were properly introduced but then left alone, such as a duo of female skunks, a group of New Yorker-ish beavers, a pair of French ducks, and a porcupine with a high-pitched voice. An especially enigmatic character was Giselle (Jane Krakowski); a love triangle is hinted at, one that involved her, Elliot, and Ian (Patrick Warburton), a competitive buck that doesn't take kindly to either Elliot or Boog. Even for a kid's film, this subplot was underdeveloped; we know that Elliot was told to leave the herd and never return, but we're never told why. Ultimately, the idea fell flat, as if the writers had no idea what to do with these characters.Some saving graces include a couple of funny lines and circumstances. Here's an example: because Boog isn't used to sleeping outdoors, he asks Elliot to sing ""The Teddy Bear's Picnic."" Elliot doesn't know the words, so he decides to make them up as he goes. He sings, ""Once there was a magical elf who lived in a rainbow tree / He lived downstairs from a flatulent dwarf who constantly had to pee."" I don't know why I liked this scene; the humor is low grade, if even necessary. Still, it was funny. So was the moment when the rabbits stare up at a group of exploding cars; they chant, ""Ooooh ... aaaah,"" as their sunglasses reflect immense fireballs.It's a shame none of this added up to a decent cartoon. ""Open Season"" tries, and I definitely give it credit for that. But I'm afraid I can't recommend it. This isn't to say that I hate the film; I don't hate it at all. I don't even dislike it. However, I don't think that it's worth paying to see, either. It's interesting that I feel this way; a number of animated films have been released this year, all of which I've enjoyed. Maybe I'm jaded. Maybe it's too much too soon. Or maybe I have problems with insane hunters and masochistic rabbits. But whatever the reason, I'm urging families to delay embracing it until it's release on DVD. At least then, I don't have to worry about noisy children running up and down the theater aisles.",3,It Ain't Bear Huntin' Season,1159574400,"09 30, 2006",2006,7091,"['learned', 'anything', 'Open',

The only problem is the fact that it really has nothing to make it stand out from the crowd.  Boog and Elliot are great characters, but they just remind me a little too much of Shrek and Donkey, and Martin Lawrence and Ashton Kutcher are pale imitations of Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy.  I actually had a little trouble with the voices.  Sometimes Boog sounded like Martin Lawrence, and sometimes he didn't; on the other hand, Elliot never sounded very much like Ashton Kutcher to me (which is actually a good thing).  The two make for a good team, but the chemistry between them doesn't always seem to come naturally.  The supporting cast of voice actors is pretty impressive, though.  It's always a kick to hear Georgia Engel's unique voice, but Billy Connolly absolutely steals the whole show time and time again as the voice of McSquizzy, the leader of the squirrels (who is always itching for a fight).Boog is a grizzly bear living the life of an ursine Riley, having been raised by Park Ranger Beth (Debra Messing).  Then a deer named Elliot, desperate to escape the clutches of an evil hunter (Gary Sinise) shows up, and he has a rather destabilizing effect on Boog's life.  Suddenly, Boog finds himself rooted out of his idyllic, pampered existence and left in the forest to survive on his own.  It doesn't go well, as he and Elliot find themselves chastised and laughed at by all manner of woodland creatures (especially McSquizzy and the squirrels).  Then things take an even more dramatic turn for the worst, as hunting season officially opens.  Eventually, Boog faces the most obvious of moral choices: return home on his own to try and reclaim his old life of leisure or turn around and help the other animals band together and fight the hunters at their own game.Don't expect any real surprises with the story, as it plays out pretty much according to formula.

Unfortunately, we've seen this movie many times before with the likes of Madagascar, Over the Hedge, Shrek, Hoodwinked, and even the 2d animated Emperor's New Groove .  Animals that venture out into the woods to learn 'valuable life lessons'(Madagascar); the big calm, collective character vs. the small annoying, hyper character (Shrek and Emperor's New Groove), and animals constantly finding themselves out of their habitat (all of the movies).Not only is the storyline hardly original, the main characters played by Martin Lawrence and Ashton Kutcher don't quite gel together well.  Funny moments are few and far in between.  The animals (skunks) with the stereotypical 'black attitude' formula has been beaten to death in this movie as well.Sony, along with Pixar need to put the 'animals in peril' storyline in the shelf once and for all and start coming up with fresh ideas.  The last great 3d animated experience that was released as of late seems to be last years 'Monster House'; technically astounding and original storyline, not to mention very funny HUMAN characters.Don't get me wrong, the 3D movie studios are great at what they do.

The film was very entertaining for the kids because of the two lead characters but as for my husband and I it was bearable. I have to admit I did doze off a couple of times but only for a few minutes. I have noticed that this is the first completely computer-generated motion picture to be created by Sony Pictures Animation (SPA).Boorg (voiced by Martin Lawrence), is the lovable bear who was rescued by a ranger and raised basically like a pet dog, has gotten too big and is now released into the wild during Open Season, which is the time when the humans come into the forest to hunt the animals. Boorg must now typically adapt to his surroundings, including using the bathroom outside (which is hilarious), finding food, among other things. His side-kick Elliot (voiced by Ashton Kutcher), a down-on-his-luck deer who has been kicked out of his herd and is being hunted by The Big Bad Hunter. Elliot just wants some friends, and wants Boorg to be his friend. The whole time I couldn't help thinking that the character of Elliot was a direct rip-off of the Donkey from Shrek. However, Donkey and Shrek are themselves a rip-off of every buddy-film of all time.The supporting characters are hilarious, but perhaps a tad underdeveloped. Honestly, the movies' best lines and jokes were in the previews that I've seen many times. I hate when that happens! My main complaint about the film was the pacing of the story. The story itself left something to be desired, because it was very predictable and filled with clich&eacute;s. However, something was off in the end. For all the build-up, it was a disappointing end, almost like it was too easy. The end needed some tweaking, that's for sure.The animation was pretty impressive. Boorg the bear was done very well, especially with his fur, which looked completely realistic.

There are a bunch of individual bits that are quite spectacular.. the rabbits are a hoot, and the broken dam part is amazing for example.  However, one begins to believe after several viewings what an ultimately empty movie this is.But... as I am writing this, I can see my daughter's face.  She is entranced.  She really likes this movie.  She's five now and has seen it at least five times that I am aware of.  And you know what?  She still enjoys the heck out of it.There isn't too much objectionable content in this movie.  You can see an incredibly out of shape and over-the-hill male rear-end in one shot.  I didn't realize it before watching the blu-ray version (Hah!  A blessing and a curse!), but the dude is definitely missing his pants. The villain can be scary at times, shooting a rifle and brandishing a knife at the animals.  There are also some poop jokes.  It's rated PG.The extras really aren't anything to write home about.  They seem to be the same as the Standard Definition Special Edition.This review is for the Blu-ray version:  The picture is amazing, it looks 3-D.  Sound is good as well.I have seen the SD version upgraded to 1080i on a Sony DVP-cx995v, and upgraded to 1080P on a Toshiba hda20, and now the Blu-ray version on the PS3 60GB.  These have all been on a Sony 60"" KDS-60A2000 which is capable of 1080p.Out of all three, I think that the Blu-ray version is the best followed by the Toshiba (I realize this is a bit apples to oranges.. also, since this movie was made by Sony, I doubt it will ever be released on HDDVD).So, if you want to show the beauty of Blu-ray this might be a good title.

Boog performs small shows along with Beth.  At the end of the day, he has his own place in the garage with everything that a pet could ask for.Then, one day by happenstance, Boog meets Elliot, a one-antlered deer who has been tied on the hood of a jeep by a hunter.  Pleading with puppy eyes, he begs Boog to free him.  At the last moment, he does.  Life is never the same for Boog afterwards.Almost immediately, Boog finds himself in the middle of a forest with Elliot.  Both of them have no survival skills or instinct.  However, Elliot initiates that he knows his way back to town but he doesn't.To make things worse, it's now open season.  Like the lion, the forest animals look up to Boog as this great grizzly bear to lead and protect them.  The problem is that Boog can't even save himself.  However, he gradually learns the ways of the forest and rounds up the forest animals to fight back against the hunters.Beth, feeling guilty, returns to the forest to bring back Boog.  However, it's a question of whether Boog will go back to his sheltered and performing life or stay in the forest where he naturally belongs.*Open Season* is plainly hilarious.

Here's the upside and the downside for ya.The Upside:Great animation.  I could tell early on by the detail in Boog's fur that the creators were using state-of-the-art technology.Some really rockin' original songs made just for the soundtrack.  I haven't enjoyed rockin' out to the credits so much in a long time.  I purchased the soundtrack CD just last week, and it's a lot of fun.The DVD includes the premium extras one expects from an epic sort of animated feature.  There's the ""making of"" documentary, an additional short feature related to the movie, and a commentary track.There's some really great gags in this movie.The Downside:I thought the bear was cliche.  Boog reminded me of part Baloo from The Jungle Book and part Sugar Bear from the cereal commercials that all Baby Boomers should be familiar with.  At least this character did change and grow during the story.The other characters seemed rather one-dimensional, and much of the the humor seemed forced.  I wish we'd learned more about Elliot's background.  Much of the relationship between Boog and Elliot reminded me of the relationship between Shrek and Donkey.  I don't have the cinematography vocabulary to describe why so much of this movie sort of worked but didn't become magical like the great 3D classics like Toy Story or Up.But the bottom line is that this movie is a lot of fun, and it stands up to a second viewing and a it's worthwhile to watch the commentary track too, and that counts for a lot.",4,Your hunt for a fun movie stops here!,1255651200,"10 16, 2009",2009,1622,"['Well', 'not', 'quite', 'magic', 'best', 'Pixar', 'movies', 'was', 'certainly', 'worthy', 'effort', 'Sony', 'Animation', 'first', 'movie', 'feature', 'Here', 'upside', 'downside', 'ya.The', 'Upside', 'Great', 'animation', 'could', 'tell', 'early', 'detail', 'Boog', 'fur', 'creators', 'were', 'using', 'state-of-the-art', 'technology.Some', 'really', 'rockin', 'original', 'songs', 'made', 'just', 'soundtrack', 'have', ""n't"", 'enjoyed', 'rockin', 'credits', 'so', 'much', 'long', 'time', 'purchased', 'soundtrack', 'CD', 'just', 'last', 'week', 'lot', 'fun.The', 'DVD', 'premium', 'one', 'epic', 'sort', 'animated', 'feature', 'making', 'documentary', 'additional', 'short', 'feature', 'related', 'movie', 'commentary', 'really', 'great', 'gags', 'movie.The', 'Downside', 'thought', 'bear', 'was', 'cliche', 'Boog', 'reminded', 'part', 'Baloo', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'part', 'Sugar', 'Bear', 'cereal', 'commercials', 'Baby', 'Boomers', 'should', 'be', 'familiar', 'least', 'character', 'did', 'change', 'grow', 'story.The', 'other', 'characters', 'seemed', 'rather', 'one-dimensional', 'much', 'humor', 'seemed', 'forced', 'wish', ""'d"", 'learned', 'more', 'Elliot', 'background', 'Much', 'relationship', 'Boog', 'Elliot', 'reminded', 'relationship', 'Shrek', 'Donkey', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'cinematography', 'vocabulary', 'describe', 'why', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'sort', 'worked', 'did', ""n't"", 'become', 'magical', 'great', '3D', 'classics', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Up.But', 'bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'lot', 'fun', 'up', 'second', 'viewing', 'worthwhile', 'watch', 'commentary', 'track', 'too', 'counts', 'lot']",N/A

1036835,AHF97M45JFCB,B000L2125O,ONENEO,"[0, 0]","Back in 2006 when Sony Animation released Open Season, the formula of talking animal animated features was pretty sure-fire.  Blue Sky was basking in the revenue the Ice Ages were bringing in, DreamWorks had Madagascar (and perhaps even more direct competition Over the Hedge) and even Disney wanted a piece of the pie with The Wild.  Sony had a pretty admirable basis with Open Season, however, one that kept it from being lumped with the others in the ideal that a domesticated grizzly bear could lose touch with all sense of instinct before being dumped back into the wild.Perhaps most impressive is that Open Season represents the first full length animated feature film to come out of Sony Imageworks (a company that would go on to produce many leading titles in the genre).The story goes a little something like this:A grizzly bear named Boog (Martin Lawrence), domesticated by a park ranger named Beth (Debra Messing) encounters an overly energetic deer named Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) in need of a hand to escape from the mullet-sporting, flannel wearing hunter, Shaw (Gary Sinise).Elliot decides to return the favor to help Boog escape from Beth's humble abode, which leads to a big misunderstanding that convinces Beth that the time to release Boog back to the wild has arrived.Boog, it turns out, having been raised with humans from cub-hood, has no idea how to survive outside of his cozy garage.Despite some shaky beginnings, Elliott and Boog end up developing an unlikely bond that becomes extremely crucial in their teaming up with the other wild animals of the forest in attempt to drive out the invading hunters.I came away pretty impressed from Open Season thanks to pacing that is neither forcefully fast nor too bogged down upon itself and a lenient enough script to allow the actors a chance to really bring some personality to the characters.  The story itself is actually quite solid with enough subtle bits and gags to appear humorous to nearly any age group.  Sure there's the requisite slapstick to appeal to the younger demographic but some of the redneck references and pop culture influence will be sure to raise a chuckle out of adults as well.The visuals were top notch then and are still impressive even today with a lot of deliberate attention to lighting and shadow (especially in the outdoor environments).  The featurette concerning the rendering of each character's digital hair is a welcomed reminder as to just how tedious and time-consuming creating this type of film can really be.While I was expectedly pleased with Martin Lawrence and Ashton Kutcher's vocal performances as they two lead characters (Boog and Elliott respectively), special props definitely have to go out to Gary Sinise for his most uncharacteristic portrayal of the hunting-obsessed human Shaw.  There's some genuine humor there that sets the tone for many of the onscreen antics to follow.  Finally, the fact that the opening credits roll to Talking Heads' Wild Wild Life is just precisely the attention to detail here that makes Open Season stick out among a crowded DVD shelf.In conclusion, it should really come as no surprise to hear that Open Season was successful enough to spawn not one but a pair of sequels (part 3 is nearly complete at the time of this review's writing).  An appropriate cast blended with an interesting story and tight visuals all adds up to a pretty rewarding experience.

1036840,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B000L2125O,Ranny Levy,"[0, 0]","This film is very cute, it makes me laugh, and has a great message. Boog (Martin Lawrence), a grizzly bear, is unwillingly taken out of the comfort and warmth of his garage. He is far away from his owner Beth (Debra Messing) and is stuck in the forest with a very annoying mule, Elliot (Ashton Kutcher.) Boog is trying to find a way to get back to his garage and owner, but hunting season is just starting. Will he be able to make it back to the safety and comfort of his home in one piece? Well, you must tune in to see.I like this film because of the comedy, the background music and the plot is very easy to understand. I think the talent does a really great job with the voice-overs and fit the part well. I love animated films and think the animation in Open Season is really good.My favorite part is when Boog is trying to catch some fish because he is hungry. So when he goes to the river to do his fishing, the fish slap him right in the face. Boog is left standing there extremely humiliated. My favorite character is Elliot, because he has a free spirit, funny and he keeps me laughing.Here are few of the people that make this film possible and do a good job. The directors are Roger Allers, Jill Culton and Anthony Stacchi (co-director). Some additional voice-overs in this animated film are, Gary Sinise (Shaw), Billy Connolly (McSquizzy), and Georgia Engel (Bobbie).A message I found in this film is that you can't always depend on someone else to take care of you. One day they might not be there to protect you, so you have to look out for yourself. Boog is used to Beth taking care of him, but once he enters the forest he has no idea what to do.I recommend Open Season for ages 6 to 13; they will definitely get it a kick out of it. It's good film for the family to sit down and enjoy it too. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars. It has a good message, the animation is great and it is an enjoyable film.

1036848,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B000L2125O,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 2]","Two things I should probably say before I get any deeper: 1) saw it in iMax & 2) I missed the onslaught of cookie-cutter animal-CGI cartoons that have supposedly been recycling each other shamelessly.  While we here at ""The Rotten Review"" instantly spotted parallels between this flick and ""Toy Story"" (odd couple heroes who begin in a safe area from which they are exiled; psychotic and destructive villain; messianic owner/protector) which we DID see, ""Open Season"" was careless, exciting, oft-senseless (if forgettable) fun.  The ""heroes"" are Boog, a tamed Grizzly bear voiced by Martin Lawrence, and Elliot, an irritating deer who looks like a cross between deer and donkey.  In fact, Elliot looks like something of a cross between any number of sidekicks - including ""Donkey"" from ""Shreck"" - and Ashton Kutcher.  Unsurprisingly, Elliot IS voiced by Ashton Kutcher, while Boog is the streetwise/forest-dumb Boog.  Early in the film, Boog saves Elliot - who's been banned from his herd for reasons undetermined, and subsequently run down by Shaw, the ostensible villain.  Elliot insists on returning the favor, a course which will see Boog exiled from a cozy experience with the ever-goody-goody Beth (Deborah Messing).  Beth has raised Boog for years, eventually having him star in a ""wilderness"" show she runs for the small number of non-hunting tourists who come to her small northwestern town of Timberline.  When finally forced to ""release"" Boog to the wild, the bear must fend for himself - which means he'll have to team up with the ineffectual Elliot as well as contend with a forest filled with animals who know that Boog is all growl/no maul.  Not unlike Boog, ""Open Season"" is more growl then maul, but it's still a lethally fun.  It's darker than most of these CGI animal fests (there's a great fight scene in the backwoods redoubt of the film's villain/hunter; the flick climaxes in a battle scene that sends up the epic Hollywood flicks of the recent era - from ""The Patriot"" to ""Narnia"", and manages to match those films in looking lively).  Even if you can predict how it'll end up, ""Open Season"" has enough firepower to make you at least feel surprised.FOR KIDS!?!?  There are many scenes in which serious assault appear imminent; knives and guns are ever present, and rabbits are repeatedly exploited by man and beast (more by beast, actually).  There's a fast-moving scene set in a flash-flood (likely included for iMax screenings, and possibly to nail the flick a ride at Disney) which may be fast for many younger viewers.

1036852,A2B7BUH8834Y6M,B000L2125O,"Shelley Gammon ""Geek""","[10, 14]","This sometimes sweet and often silly tale involves a park ranger who has rescued a bear cub and must learn to part ways with him as his 900lb size and penchant for sugar makes him somewhat uncontrollable in the small hunting town they live in. The local sheriff is a sweet, older Native American man. His tribe is not mentioned and I really like the way his character is so natural in its role - other than his facial features and braided ponytail, the ethnicity is not an issue. That is truly rare in animation or anywhere else in entertainment... so a big-fat star for that right off the bat.Beth (Debra Messing), the young park ranger, manages to rescue a cub and raise him on a handful of cat treat crackers, she pilots a helicopter and has trained the bear to ride a unicycle - but she doesn't know the first thing about re-introducing a wild animal back to the wild. My guess is that animal rehabilitators and park rangers around the country are going to have complaints about this entire portrayal. Bears are wild animals. Some wild animals can be controlled - but not bears. They do turn on their caretakers without warning. They are cute, but they are still wild.The 900lb grizzly, Boog, helps to free a mule deer that was tied to the hood of a hunter's truck. Most reputable hunters will not be happy at the stereotypical portrayal of the backwoods yokel who hates living things, has hillbilly teeth and cuddles his rifle and covers it with a blanket at night. He has named his rifle ""Lorraine"" and has 'her' name etched into the stock. Don't get me wrong - I'm not a hunter and would never shoot an animal for a trophy - but I know all hunters are not represented by this cretin.The hunter is easy to hate, so when he nearly drowns to death, loses his truck in a flood and is run over by an RV, these are all elements of  humor. Houston, we have a problem. We complain about getting desensitized to violence in our society - and here we go right in an animated kid's flick.Through a series of mishaps, Elliot, the mule deer, and Boog are put in a situation where they are deep in hunting territory as open season begins. As they fear for their lives, they turn the tables on the hunters, blowing up their trucks, vandalizing property, stealing things, fire-bombing them, gassing them,  etc.Yes, I know this is a cartoon, but despite its sweet natured appearance, it subtly teaches the wrong kind of morals to children:1.) we can take what we want, when we want it, and there are no consequences2.) vandalism is funny3.) victims of vandalism are not to be sympathized with, especially if they are odd4.) it is funny when wild animals harm people5.) unresponsible adults can frequently skirt the law and get away with anything as long as they're not 'caught'6.) toilet humor is always funny - no need to think - just show something/someone pooping or using a toilet and we have instant laughter7.) it is funny when someone's family pet runs away or is stolenIn one scene, a local store is entirely destroyed by some 'friendly' animal characters who basically destroy and/or consume the store's contents. There are no overt consequences. No one has to pay the store owner. No one ever sees the store owner. Those responsible for the animals are not held financially responsible.I wouldn't say that all movies should teach the 10 commandments at all times, but movies for children do carry a weightier responsibility - and I think that many of the morals (or lack thereof) diisplayed in this movie are irresponsible.As an adult, I laughed out loud in several spots. The film is serious in some spots, and in others, unrealistically slapstick and far-reaching. It still works as far as being entertaining, but I must say, this would not be a film I'd care to see again or acquire on DVD.Note that this is PG, not G. The bear utters an explitive at least once and I would say that this is not suitable for kids under 8... some parents may not deem it suitable at all.The animation is well rendered - it's amazing to see how hair, fur and foliage respond to wind and movement. The animals are expressive and sweet-looking. Rabbit owners (such as myself) will eye-roll at how the rabbits are portrayed. I am not sure that I have ever seen an accurate portrayal of rabbits in animated form, however - so whatever.Again, as an adult, it is always a nice diversion to be entertained by furry animals without having every other word in the film being some gutter talk and without people bed-hopping, but I'm not sure I'd show this to my own kids until they were teens. It's just too easy to be subtly taught to think of yourself and how you can be entertained before feelling sympathy for others that are hurt. I admit I am becoming a fuddy-duddy as I get older - but when you frequently see better films, it's easy to see this one in its proper light (or lack thereof).",3,"95% Laugh-out-loud, 75% family

The story then unfolds of his trying to return home and his interactions with nature.There are better movie choices out there, but if you are looking for a tier zero title to show off what your new Blu-ray player can do, this is it.  This is the first Blu-ray disc I own that actually is on par with the Ant Bully in HD DVD.  This comes from the fact that Sony released this movie in the AVC MPEG-4 format as opposed to the usual MPEG-2 releases we see on Blu-Ray.  The picture is absolutely amazing!!!  It is bright and consistant throughout the film.  It certainly helps that it was a direct to digital conversion.  The sound is also above par.  It isn't the most active sound track and at times falls a bit flat but is pretty good for an animated film.This disc really shines when it comes to extras.  While the title is not a BD-50 release it saves space by going AVC so it still has a lot to offer from delete scenes to Wheel of Fortune to an animated short with Boog and Elliot.While this movie has been a big hit with my kids (watching it for the 8th time right now), it is just ok to me.

Although the story is a little cutesy about a domesticated bear trying to find his way home after his deer friend stirs up trouble, and Boog (the bear voiced by Martin Lawrence) gets the blame and the penultimate boot by being drugged and dropped off in the middle of the wilderness.  Not realizing it was his owner who dropped him there, he sets off on a journey (uh oh! Filled with potty humor, slapstick comedy, and silliness)  Although the Scottish Acorn chucking squirrels did bring up the chuckle, the rest of the movie didn't.If you're under 12, this movie could actually work as ""quality"" entertainment- but I was bored out of my mind and can't believed I watched teh whole thing.

1036863,A1MZNOE1OABAQK,B000L2125O,thecableguy,"[0, 0]","These computer animated movies about talking animals are all starting to look the same.  Martin Lawrence plays a domesticated grizzly bear named Boog, who lives in a garage when he's not entertaining tourists by riding a unicycle.  The film's most distinctive character is probably Beth, the redheaded ranger bearkeeper/tour guide, voiced by Debra Messing. Ashton Kutcher is the voice of Elliot the deer, who after Boog is expelled into the forest after a series of small disasters, becomes Boog's ally in his fight to assert themselves against incoming hunters.  At times Elliot seemed more like the donkey from Shrek.  Jack Black voices the main villain/hunter, a stereotypical backwoods hunter, except he has a fondness for mushrooms, and does air guitar solos on his rifle while singing ""I Just Called to Say I Love You"" before shooting his prey.  Patrick Warburton (""The Tick"") voices another buck competing with Elliot for the affection of a doe.  Billy Connolly is amusing as the leader of an army of acorn wielding squirrels. There are thousands of them.Quibbles aside, ""Open Season"" is entertaining enough to sit through and elicited more laughs from my family and I than I expected -- I wouldn't say it's absolutely entertaining as declared by the Film Advisory Board on the disc case -- I guess it depends on who the family is.  There are even a few lessons in between all the goofy happenings that might be fun/rewarding to discuss with your kids if you're into that sort of thing.  Also, the soundtrack features some of the best solo work I've heard from Paul Westerberg since his first solo album, maybe even better. Why'd you save it all for a silly movie soundtrack, Paul?

Living in the ranger's garage, they make the trip into town on a daily basis and Boog performs to the delight of dozens of children. One day, after the show, the ranger pulls up to the Sheriff's office and Boog waits in the back of the Jeep. Shaw (Gary Sinise), a backwoods man who only lives to hunt, shows up with a buck on his hood. As soon as Shaw leaves, Elliot (Ashton Kutcher), the Buck,  wakes up and pleads with Boog to help him get free. Boog reluctantly agrees and Shaw watches this from inside the station. Eventually, with just three days to Open Season, Boog and Elliot find themselves out in the wilderness and Boog is desperate to get back to his safe garage. But he meets many animals out there and they form an alliance to protect themselves against the hunters.""Open Season"" is a cute, humorous film that will keep both children and the adults chauffeurs happy. It falls short of becoming a classic, but it is certainly one of the better non-Disney/ Pixar animated offerings out there.When I initially saw the trailers for ""Open Season"", Martin Lawrence seemed an odd choice to play a cartoon character. The clips featured him providing a very laid back persona for the character. But this actually works very well. Boog is a large Grizzly Bear and he isn't going to be as frantic or fast paced as Elliot, a little hyperactive buck. Because of his size and the nature of his character, he takes a moment or two to figure things out before acting. It is an amusing performance.From the moment we meet Boog, the filmmakers show his eccentricities. He is a Grizzly Bear, but he has been domesticated. He lives in a garage and sleeps on his bed, with his stuffed teddy bear. Beth, the ranger, has to tuck him in at night and sing ""The Teddy Bear's Picnic"" to get him to go to sleep. Then, when he is initially exposed to the wilderness, he panics, because he isn't used to it. Gradually, he meets other animals and he and Elliot form a sort of odd couple and help the animals band together.Ashton Kutcher provides a nice balance to Martin Lawrence. As the hyperactive Elliot, he is initially very happy to show Boog everything he has learned about the outside world. Elliot introduces Boog to candy, sugar and other human delicacies. Then, they both get transported to the wilderness and both are shocked but Elliot realizes Boog will need his help to survive. Throughout, Elliot isn't above playing on the emotions of his fellow animals to get his way. For instance, after they first arrive in the wilderness, Elliot gets stuck and Boog only wants to get home, and feels he will be able to make better time with out the little deer, so he leaves Elliot in his predicament. But Elliot knows the large bear will soon need him and waits it out.Throughout, they meet a plethora of characters, including a squirrel named McSquizzy (Billy Connolly), leader of an army of squirrels who protect the trees of the forest, Ian (Patrick Warburton), the leader of a herd of deer, Mr. Weenie (Cody Cameron), a little dachshund who escapes from his owners, Bobbie (Georgia Engle) and her husband, and many more. Ducks, porcupines, skunks and rabbits all make appearances and help the animals battle the hunters.Gary Sinise does a very good job of bringing Shaw to life. This is one twisted dude, who lives in a little shack and relishes the moment he can hunt, and kill animals, and stop the `animal rebellion'. He is a cross between a character from ""Deliverance"" and some of the villains from recent Disney animated films. It's nice work, but there are a few too many scenes showing Shaw talking to himself about the animals taking over, or the like, in an effort to prove how crazy he is. We get it.There are a number of funny jokes and references to the animals and their environments. Since Boog is domesticated, he has difficulty going to the bathroom in the woods. Get it? Rabbits frequently pop up in the place of other items, a funny running gag. When Elliot first tries to attract Boog's attention, he throws rabbits at a window and they each flatten out before falling down and running off. Later, Boog tries to dry off and grabs something and it turns out to be rabbits.The animation in ""Open Season"" appears to have been influenced by the great Looney Tunes shorts and Chuck Jones in particular. Each of the animals has a distinct personality and frequently break into grins, much like Wile E. Coyote or Sylvester. Each is also slightly off, to varying degrees, making them interesting and clear descendents of the great Looney Tunes. I'm not saying they are as good as these classic cartoons, but the influence is noticeable and enhances this film more than you might imagine.""Open Season"" is not the best animated effort I have ever seen, or even the best this year, but it is enjoyable and will keep both the kids and the parent chauffeurs amused.",4,"3 1/2.

1036870,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000L2125O,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","`Open Season,' Sony Picture's first feature animation film is about a series of misadventures of Boog and Elliot, mismatched pair of animals that have to join forces to survive, yes, `open season.' The film does not take itself very seriously as you can tell from the voice cast of the two leads: domesticated grizzly bear by Martin Lawrence and fast-talking mule deer by Ashton Kutcher. Don't worry, their voice acting is not bad, and Ashton Kutcher is actually very good.The greatest thing about `Open Season' is obvious from the very beginning; it's not story, it's not music, but it is the picture, or the wonderful CG-created images that retain the simple beauty of 2D animations. The movements of objects are all smooth and natural (and aptly exaggerated sometimes), and the characters (that often look like real puppets) are given colorful textures that are simply amazing to see.But `Open Season' falls short for me because it has virtually no new story to tell. For all the joyful sequences about the slapstick battles between the hunters and animals, we know its outcome from the beginning; we know the animals would unite and resist; we know what Boog will do at the end. In most films (especially comedies) these predictable elements do not damage the film much. In `Open Season' they do ... at least to some fans like me, who have seen so many animations featuring animals like `Madagascar' and ``Over the Hedge.'

Martin Lawrence is brilliant as the voice of Boog the Grizzly Bear. He deserves an Oscar for his touching, hilarious vocalizations. And Ashton Kutcher will blow you away as Elliott the buck with one antler. Wait until you hear Gary Sinise as the evil hunter. Incredibly funny. Other performances include Debra Messing as the park ranger who adopted Boog and Patrick Warburton (Puddy from Seinfeld) as the lead buck in the deer herd. Buy it, you will watch it again and again.

(See first paragraph of review of Chris Pandolfi, way back on 9-29-2006, for a more complete description of the problem.)Bashing another creature, especially the senseless kind like that done to rabbits in Open Season, is not something that I like my kids to see. This is why all cartoon channels are off-limits to them. We are not talking here about killing for food or survival. This is just plain stupid violence and I consider it highly inappropriate for a kids movie.Sure, there is a lot of other violence in this movie--violence that I do not find particularly objectionable because it has a purpose, it fits the storyline, and it is done with a high level of humor, as opposed to throwing rabbits against a window when a pebble has worked well for as long as we have had windows!I don't want to make too big of a thing about the rabbit bashing, but I am surprised that only about 4 or 5 out of 28 reviewers thus far have expressed their disappointment with this aspect of Open Season. Fortunately, there are not a lot of these rabbit bashing scenes in the movie, and the rabbits do sort of get to join in with the rest of the animals at one point, so maybe it is not even noticed by young children, but it sticks in my mind and detracted from the movie.",4,"There's Just Something About a Funny, Friendly Bear that Kids Love",1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,1503,"['Yes', 'whole', 'family', 'two-year', 'old', 'three-year', 'old', 'daughters', 'enjoyed', 'Open', 'Season', 'would', 'recommend', 'one', 'minor', 'reservation', 'What', 'rabbit', 'bashing', 'movie', 'terrible', 'message', 'kids', 'See', 'first', 'paragraph', 'review', 'Chris', 'Pandolfi', 'way', 'back', '9-29-2006', 'more', 'complete', 'description', 'problem', 'Bashing', 'creature', 'especially', 'senseless', 'kind', 'done', 'rabbits', 'Open', 'Season', 'not', 'something', 'like', 'kids', 'see', 'why', 'cartoon', 'channels', 'are', 'off-limits', 'are', 'not', 'talking', 'here', 'killing', 'food', 'survival', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'violence', 'consider', 'highly', 'inappropriate', 'kids', 'movie.Sure', 'lot', 'other', 'violence', 'movie', 'violence', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'particularly', 'objectionable', 'purpose', 'storyline', 'done', 'high', 'level', 'humor', 'opposed', 'throwing', 'rabbits', 'window', 'when', 'pebble', 'worked', 'well', 'as', 'long', 'have', 'had', 'windows', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'too', 'big', 'thing', 'rabbit', 'bashing', 'am', 'surprised', 'only', '4', '5', '28', 'reviewers', 'thus', 'far', 'have', 'expressed', 'disappointment', 'aspect', 'Open', 'Season', 'Fortunately', 'are', 'not', 'lot', 'rabbit', 'bashing', 'scenes', 'movie', 'rabbits', 'do', 'sort', 'get', 'join', 'rest', 'animals', 'one', 'point', 'maybe', 'not', 'even', 'noticed', 'young', 'children', 'mind', 'detracted', 'movie']",N/A

Boog the Bear, pet bear to a park ranger Beth, befriends a cast out deer, Elliot, who lead Boog down the wrong path and ultimatly gets Boog sent back to the wild...with Elliot. The fun takes off from their as Boog tries to find his way back to his cozy spot in the ranger Beth's garage.  How does a domesticated bear survive?

1036875,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000L2125O,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[0, 1]","In Sony Picture's first animated release a tame bear and a wild deer get together to learn about friendship and making it in the wild... that's the basic premise I guess.Martin Lawrence and Ashton Kutcher provide the voices of the two main characters, while Debra Messing and Gary Sinise provide some of the human supporting cast.The film starts out a little rocky, leaning towards boring and pointless as we watch Boog, the bear waddle around and bask in the glory that is his enviable life of living in a garage and performing circus-like tricks in the local town. Then one day, as he's waiting in the back of his owner's Jeep, he sees a one-horned mule deer named Eliot (Ashton Kutcher) strapped to the hood of a truck, and in a moment of compassion, decides to free him.This is what finally gets the ball rolling. The mule deer makes his escape, much to the chagrin of the caricatured ""evil"" hunter, masterfully voiced by Gary Sinise, and from then on, the hunt is on. Eliot first tries to get Boog to leave his safe home in the garage and trash the local town grocery, and then sets himself out on a mission to get them both back to the comfort of the garage. That's all a bit muddled and confusing, but children probably aren't paying much attention to logistics anyway.Throughout the film there are some funny moments, a few that are laugh out loud funny, a few that might coax forward a slight chuckle. Overall, the comedy in the film is a bit lukewarm. The storyline isn't that amazing, although in the special features everyone from the producers to the artists claim that story is the most important part of their film... maybe they're talking about a different film.In the end, the caricatures of hunters as evil pillagers is a bit harsh, especially since the main character is a BEAR, who in reality would be eating the deer he has befriended, and there's a good message of friendship to be had at the end, if you look past the fact that the two main ""friends"" never actually seem to have that much camraderie. But again your children probably aren't paying that much attention.Sony has made an admirable effort at throwing their hat into the animation ring, and hopefully their future efforts will be a little more fully realized, but Open Season is definitely a good first try.",3,Watching the special features helps boost your view of the film,1175472000,"04 2, 2007",2007,2292,"['Sony', 'Picture', 'first', 'animated', 'release', 'tame', 'bear', 'wild', 'deer', 'get', 'together', 'learn', 'friendship', 'making', 'wild', 'basic', 'premise', 'guess.Martin', 'Lawrence', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'provide', 'voices', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'provide', 'human', 'supporting', 'cast.The', 'film', 'out', 'little', 'rocky', 'leaning', 'towards', 'boring', 'pointless', 'watch', 'Boog', 'bear', 'waddle', 'bask', 'glory', 'enviable', 'life', 'living', 'garage', 'performing', 'circus-like', 'tricks', 'local', 'town', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'waiting', 'back', 'owner', 'Jeep', 'one-horned', 'mule', 'deer', 'named', 'Eliot', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'strapped', 'hood', 'truck', 'moment', 'compassion', 'free', 'him.This', 'what', 'finally', 'ball', 'rolling', 'mule', 'deer', 'escape', 'much', 'chagrin', 'caricatured', 'evil', 'hunter', 'masterfully', 'voiced', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'then', 'hunt', 'Eliot', 'first', 'tries', 'get', 'Boog', 'leave', 'safe', 'home', 'garage', 'trash', 'local', 'town', 'grocery', 'then', 'out', 'mission', 'get', 'back', 'comfort', 'garage', 'bit', 'muddled', 'confusing', 'children', 'probably', 'are', ""n't"", 'paying', 'much', 'attention', 'logistics', 'film', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'few', 'are', 'loud', 'funny', 'few', 'might', 'coax', 'forward', 'slight', 'chuckle', 'Overall', 'comedy', 'film', 'bit', 'lukewarm', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'amazing', 'special', 'features', 'everyone', 'producers', 'artists', 'claim', 'story', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'film', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'talking', 'different', 'film.In', 'end', 'caricatures', 'hunters', 'evil', 'pillagers', 'bit', 'harsh', 'especially', 'main', 'character', 'BEAR', 'who', 'reality', 'would', 'be', 'eating', 'deer', 'befriended', 'good', 'message', 'friendship', 'be', 'had', 'end', 'look', 'fact', 'two', 'main', 'friends', 'never', 'actually', 'seem', 'have', 'much', 'camraderie', 'again', 'children', 'probably', 'are', ""n't"", 'paying', 'much', 'attention.Sony', 'made', 'admirable', 'effort', 'throwing', 'hat', 'animation', 'ring', 'hopefully', 'future', 'efforts', 'will', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'fully', 'realized', 'Open', 'Season', 'definitely', 'good', 'first', 'try']",N/A
