Problem was one episode on each disc, something was wrong.  I contacted the seller and told him about it and he said return it and it would be replaced with another.  I did this, but had written what disc was defected with black ink. He returned it back again stating that they could not accept  the back because of the writing on the disc.  All he had to do was take a tissue and wipe my writing off.
