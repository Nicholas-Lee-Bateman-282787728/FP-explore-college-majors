1134297,A1S26JXPQKFVPI,B001221DTW,Alexander Arsov,"[0, 0]","It's not really a remake as both movies have nothing in common but the basic plot; very few of the original lines have been retained. It is worth seeing mostly because Michael Caine now plays Andrew Wyke and because the dashing Jude Law is rather fine as Milo Tindle. Visually the movie is drab and futuristic, though not without certain charm.The screenplay is the real problem. It was written by Harold Pinter and he has ruined completely the character of the original. The lighthearted yet pointed banter is exchanged for a heavy-handed dialogue full of nasty and bitter humour. Mr Pinter commits at least two other grave mistakes: he counts too much on foul language (a sure sign of artistic impotence) and he introduces unnecessary homosexual references (nowadays badly dated as well).(To be fair, there is a slight hint of the homosexual stuff in the original play as well. Fortunately, Mr Shaffer was wise enough not to elaborate on it. There are certain moments in the old movie when Andrew and Milo do look like participants in a steamy seduction scene, but the reason for this is their passion for playing games, not any sexual attraction.)The movie is directed by no other but Kenneth Branagh himself. Well, to be blunt, his direction is by turns misguidedly imaginative and tediously static.",2,A very misguided remake of the 1972 classic with Olivier and Caine,1351900800,"11 3, 2012",2012,1303,"['not', 'really', 'remake', 'movies', 'have', 'nothing', 'common', 'basic', 'plot', 'very', 'few', 'original', 'lines', 'have', 'been', 'retained', 'worth', 'seeing', 'mostly', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'now', 'Andrew', 'Wyke', 'dashing', 'Jude', 'Law', 'rather', 'fine', 'Milo', 'Tindle', 'Visually', 'movie', 'drab', 'futuristic', 'not', 'certain', 'charm.The', 'screenplay', 'real', 'problem', 'was', 'written', 'Harold', 'Pinter', 'ruined', 'completely', 'character', 'original', 'lighthearted', 'yet', 'pointed', 'banter', 'exchanged', 'heavy-handed', 'dialogue', 'full', 'nasty', 'bitter', 'humour', 'Mr', 'Pinter', 'commits', 'least', 'two', 'other', 'grave', 'mistakes', 'too', 'much', 'foul', 'language', 'sure', 'sign', 'artistic', 'impotence', 'unnecessary', 'homosexual', 'references', 'nowadays', 'badly', 'dated', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'fair', 'slight', 'hint', 'homosexual', 'stuff', 'original', 'play', 'as', 'well', 'Fortunately', 'Mr', 'Shaffer', 'was', 'wise', 'enough', 'not', 'elaborate', 'are', 'certain', 'moments', 'old', 'movie', 'when', 'Andrew', 'Milo', 'do', 'look', 'participants', 'steamy', 'seduction', 'scene', 'reason', 'passion', 'playing', 'games', 'not', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'movie', 'directed', 'other', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Well', 'be', 'blunt', 'direction', 'turns', 'misguidedly', 'imaginative', 'tediously', 'static']",N/A
1134298,A3ULZ8Y0EQNYK9,B001221DTW,B.E.F.,"[12, 15]",".I just saw this film on DVD, having missed it last Fall: even in Los Angeles it was at the theater for only a brief time.  I had been waiting in eager anticipation for the DVD.  Am I disappointed?  No.  Did I like it?  Absolutely.  Is it a perfect film?  Not quite.  Is it flawed?  Marginally.Only a very ill-informed person would not know of the 1972 film of the same title.SleuthAnd this is part of the problem, for the plot turns on a surprise twist which will be no surprise if one has seen the earlier film.  In other words, if you already know what's going to happen, well, let's just say the fictive required suspension of disbelief becomes a much bigger hurdle.And then again, there's something about the pace and choreography of the film: it seems a little off beat, meaning it's either too fast, or misses the beat--but this too may be due to my excessive familiarly with the earlier masterpiece.  I saw it at the theater when it d&eacute;buted, and I've owned the original DVD issue for years: in fact, I watch it at least every six months.SleuthThe original film has much more humour: it floats lighter on the wing.  The original film was a much ""richer"" film; this one is very sleek and minimalistic.  And this film of course has a much harder edge--as one would expect in the 21st Century.  Both films have exquisite set design--no doubt about that: there's plenty to look at always.  The sound track is okay; but the sound track for the original was excellent.  Harold Pinter is one of our finest playwrights of the English language--(along with David MametThe Spanish PrisonerHeistThe Winslow Boy).  Pinter's dialogue is like the original Anthony Schaffer play run through a sieve: all the parts are there, but much of the ornate sparkle is lost--again, 21st Century minimalism, etc.I've always loved Michael Caine and of course he was superb in the original.  Here he's pretty good--and gets better in the later-half of the film.  Nevertheless, there's something about the pacing and the dialogue which compares unfavorably with the original.Jude Law is one of our finest actors, period.  (He was especially perfect as Bosie Douglas in WildeWilde (Special Edition).  He was excellent in the first half of The Talented Mr. RipleyThe Talented Mr. Ripley.  He was pretty good in Cold MountainCold Mountain (Two-Disc Collector's Edition).)  He is the star here: uniformly excellent throughout, but especially good in the second half.If a viewer can see this film as an independent work of art s/he may enjoy it more.  If the viewer is too familiar with the original, he may be marginally disappointed.By the way, I didn't find anything exceptional about Branagh's directing (cf.Shackleton - The Greatest Survival Story of All Time (3-Disc Collector's Edition)Conspiracy), the cinematography, nor the editing.  Still, the set design is outstanding in a creepy, minimalistic, sterile sort of way.5-stars for some kind of artistic/intellectual effort.",5,It Is What It Is...,1205452800,"03 14, 2008",2008,2962,"['.I', 'just', 'saw', 'film', 'DVD', 'having', 'missed', 'last', 'Fall', 'even', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'was', 'theater', 'only', 'brief', 'time', 'had', 'been', 'waiting', 'eager', 'anticipation', 'DVD', 'Am', 'disappointed', 'No', 'Did', 'Absolutely', 'perfect', 'film', 'Not', 'quite', 'flawed', 'Marginally.Only', 'very', 'ill-informed', 'person', 'would', 'not', 'know', '1972', 'film', 'same', 'title.SleuthAnd', 'part', 'problem', 'plot', 'surprise', 'twist', 'will', 'be', 'no', 'surprise', 'one', 'seen', 'earlier', 'film', 'other', 'words', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'fictive', 'required', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'much', 'bigger', 'hurdle.And', 'then', 'again', 'something', 'pace', 'choreography', 'film', 'little', 'off', 'beat', 'meaning', 'too', 'fast', 'beat', 'too', 'may', 'be', 'due', 'excessive', 'familiarly', 'earlier', 'masterpiece', 'saw', 'theater', 'when', 'd', 'eacute', 'buted', ""'ve"", 'owned', 'original', 'DVD', 'issue', 'years', 'fact', 'watch', 'least', 'six', 'months.SleuthThe', 'original', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'humour', 'lighter', 'wing', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'much', 'richer', 'film', 'one', 'very', 'sleek', 'minimalistic', 'film', 'course', 'much', 'harder', 'edge', 'one', 'would', 'expect', '21st', 'Century', 'films', 'have', 'exquisite', 'set', 'design', 'doubt', 'plenty', 'look', 'always', 'sound', 'track', 'okay', 'sound', 'track', 'original', 'was', 'excellent', 'Harold', 'Pinter', 'one', 'finest', 'playwrights', 'English', 'language', 'David', 'MametThe', 'Spanish', 'PrisonerHeistThe', 'Winslow', 'Boy', 'Pinter', 'dialogue', 'original', 'Anthony', 'Schaffer', 'play', 'run', 'sieve', 'parts', 'are', 'there', 'much', 'ornate', 'sparkle', 'lost', 'again', '21st', 'Century', 'minimalism', 'etc.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'course', 'was', 'superb', 'original', 'Here', 'pretty', 'good', 'better', 'later-half', 'film', 'Nevertheless', 'something', 'pacing', 'dialogue', 'unfavorably', 'original.Jude', 'Law', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'period', 'was', 'especially', 'perfect', 'Bosie', 'Douglas', 'WildeWilde', 'Special', 'Edition', 'was', 'excellent', 'first', 'half', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'RipleyThe', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Cold', 'MountainCold', 'Mountain', 'Two-Disc', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'star', 'here', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'especially', 'good', 'second', 'half.If', 'viewer', 'can', 'see', 'film', 'independent', 'work', 'art', 's/he', 'may', 'enjoy', 'more', 'viewer', 'too', 'familiar', 'original', 'may', 'be', 'marginally', 'disappointed.By', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'exceptional', 'Branagh', 'directing', 'cf.Shackleton', 'Greatest', 'Survival', 'Story', 'All', 'Time', '3-Disc', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Conspiracy', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'Still', 'set', 'design', 'outstanding', 'creepy', 'minimalistic', 'sterile', 'sort', 'way.5-stars', 'kind', 'artistic/intellectual', 'effort']",N/A

Why?Because the film is about one man who goes to see his wifes much older ex-husband.  Actually, the older ex-husband is STILL legally married to the woman as the younger guy finds out, and this leads to one of the most delightfully presented and interesting mystery movies I've seen in a while because the two men obviously dislike each other and they both want the woman for themselves.  The story is about the two of them playing serious games with each other.  Head games basically.I'm not sure if the two men even realized ahead of time if their little tricks would work or not, but both characters were witty and intelligent and were unable to completely fool each other, which is what made the plot so intriguing.And the twists?  There's many of them.  One twist involving the detective totally floored me because I didn't see it coming.You never actually see the wife though, because the entire movie takes place inside the mansion.

Their performances really show off their skills and how well they play off each other. From the interviews I have read this not a ""remake"" of the 1972 version (which is often said with every remake), it is a film that could stand alone.  I have only seen bits and pieces of the '72 version. What really hurts this film is the setting of the film and the odd directing styles.  Mr. Branagh style is a little too much experimental for my taste, I find the angles to be odd and distracting. You have two wonderful actors performing, we want to see their performances. The use of the security cameras made little sense and comes off as if it was added in post production. The set was also a distraction, which could be from my own views in what a house should be like.  The modern furniture and art was distracting and took away from the performances of the two actors.  The script was disjointed and it was hard for me as an viewer to  try to get a lock on where the characters were going or who was playing who. And that could easily be the whole point in that you have to keep guessing who is acting and who is not acting. I would recommend this film to any Michael Caine fan or Jude Law fan (this is the first Jude Law film I have watched in its entirety).

I will not compare the two because I have only seen excerpts from the first one.This film has no real suspense because we know at once what it is all about. The interest of the film is in the two actors and how they build their confrontation in a super-minimalist set. The only sophistication is the lighting or the lights if you prefer. But the value of these changing lights is to make you, the audience, lose your footing and it works.What about the two actors and their playing, acting, gaming or hunting, titillating appeal and anti-appeal? It is OK here and you will believe the devilish turn-around, turn-about and hairpin spinning in the situation. But then we can wonder what the film is all about. Does it represent in anyway anything but that kind of expertise on the side of the actors to lure us with something that is so obvious that any avid reader of thrillers and pulp fiction knows ahead of time what is coming?We know for example the detective is no detective and we know he has to be the young man of before in a way or another because he knows too much and the way he is dressed is sloppy. Not typical of even a village detective in England with rural herds.Too bad because Michael Caine had managed to dominate and control his London accent, but Jude Law had some kind of slurpy (just the proper word since he plays a gay-gay game later on: ""gettin head. when a girl orally pleases you. it involves suckin and is messy if not done correctly, hints the name,"" as the urban dictionary says) accent when trying to be a detective that he was not.

They already got this one right. The play by Anthony Shaffer was a clever bit of gamesmanship -- a sort of country manor ""cozy"" mixed with a black comedy of manners spiced by dashes of Grand Guignol theatricality -- and it was played to the hilt by Lord Larry and his upstart challenger, Caine. Great hambone fun, check it out if you haven't seen it.As if to compensate for the inevitable 'why bother' factor, the remake brings some heavyweights to the ring. In a neat reversal, we now have Michael Caine in the role of Elder Statesman and Jude Law (who filled Caine's shoes in a tepid remake of Alfie a few years back) looking to prove his mettle. Kenneth Branagh sits in the director's chair and the script is by a not-too-obscure scribe named Harold Pinter. The movie almost collapses under the weight of that line-up, but audiences ready to rumble with a cynical exercise in style, wit, and showmanship may get malicious pleasure out of the proceedings.Caine and Law, two wonderful actors routinely hired to add prestige to Hollywood piffle, are clearly having a grand ol' time tearing into each other. Caine, with his hooded eyes and horsey choppers, looks like he could literally eat Jude Law for lunch. When it comes to performance, he just about does -- the effect is like watching Law endure an 86-minute Master's Workshop in acting. But it'd be wrong to assume that Law rolls over and plays dead. He's an awfully good actor in his own right (as ""Gattaca"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" attest) and he comes out (and goes down) swinging. But for my money, Caine, with his expert timing and nuanced delivery, wins this match in a tiebreak.Watching two fine actors do their best playing two nasty characters doing their worst is a guilty pleasure. ""Sleuth"" succeeds as an exercise in pure style. The slick set design, kooky camerawork, and acting pyrotechnics--not to mention the Pinter-provided repartee--kept my mind engaged even as I lost all interest in the human element of the drama. As the action escalates and the two Alpha males (Alfie males? Haha...sorry) engage in a Pissing Contest of epic proportions, Pinter injects an unexpected element completely absent from the 1972 version. While the first go-round played with the idea of British class-consciousness by pairing aristocratic Olivier and Cockney Caine, this update has a lot more to say about gender roles and the crisis of masculinity (surprise, surprise, coming from Pinter).",3,War of Wits,1235952000,"03 2, 2009",2009,2637,"['familiar', 'deliciously', 'over-the-top', '1972', 'version', 'Sleuth', 'pitted', 'legendary', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'lean-and-hungry', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'may', 'rightly', 'wonder', 'why', 'bother', 'already', 'got', 'one', 'right', 'play', 'Anthony', 'Shaffer', 'was', 'clever', 'bit', 'gamesmanship', 'sort', 'country', 'manor', 'cozy', 'mixed', 'black', 'comedy', 'manners', 'spiced', 'dashes', 'Grand', 'Guignol', 'theatricality', 'was', 'played', 'hilt', 'Lord', 'Larry', 'upstart', 'challenger', 'Caine', 'Great', 'hambone', 'fun', 'check', 'out', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'it.As', 'compensate', 'inevitable', 'bother', 'factor', 'remake', 'heavyweights', 'ring', 'neat', 'reversal', 'now', 'have', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'role', 'Elder', 'Statesman', 'Jude', 'Law', 'who', 'filled', 'Caine', 'shoes', 'tepid', 'remake', 'Alfie', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'looking', 'prove', 'mettle', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'director', 'chair', 'script', 'not-too-obscure', 'scribe', 'named', 'Harold', 'Pinter', 'movie', 'almost', 'weight', 'line-up', 'audiences', 'ready', 'rumble', 'cynical', 'exercise', 'style', 'wit', 'showmanship', 'may', 'get', 'malicious', 'pleasure', 'proceedings.Caine', 'Law', 'two', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'routinely', 'hired', 'add', 'prestige', 'Hollywood', 'piffle', 'are', 'clearly', 'having', 'grand', 'ol', 'time', 'tearing', 'other', 'Caine', 'hooded', 'eyes', 'horsey', 'choppers', 'could', 'literally', 'eat', 'Jude', 'Law', 'lunch', 'When', 'performance', 'just', 'about', 'effect', 'watching', 'Law', 'endure', '86-minute', 'Master', 'Workshop', 'acting', ""'d"", 'be', 'wrong', 'assume', 'Law', 'plays', 'dead', 'awfully', 'good', 'actor', 'own', 'right', 'Gattaca', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'attest', 'out', 'down', 'swinging', 'money', 'Caine', 'expert', 'timing', 'nuanced', 'delivery', 'match', 'tiebreak.Watching', 'two', 'fine', 'actors', 'do', 'best', 'playing', 'two', 'nasty', 'characters', 'doing', 'worst', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'Sleuth', 'exercise', 'pure', 'style', 'slick', 'set', 'design', 'kooky', 'camerawork', 'acting', 'pyrotechnics', 'not', 'mention', 'Pinter-provided', 'repartee', 'kept', 'mind', 'engaged', 'even', 'lost', 'interest', 'human', 'element', 'drama', 'action', 'two', 'Alpha', 'males', 'Alfie', 'males', 'Haha', 'sorry', 'engage', 'Pissing', 'Contest', 'epic', 'proportions', 'Pinter', 'unexpected', 'element', 'completely', 'absent', '1972', 'version', 'first', 'go-round', 'played', 'idea', 'British', 'class-consciousness', 'pairing', 'aristocratic', 'Olivier', 'Cockney', 'Caine', 'update', 'lot', 'more', 'say', 'gender', 'roles', 'crisis', 'masculinity', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'coming', 'Pinter']",N/A

Bernabo,"[12, 15]","Given the ongoing onslaught of remakes of films, both classic and trashy, that Hollywood has been overdosing on in recent years, there is an obvious impulse to label this new version of ""Sleuth"" a remake of one of the few films in history in which the entire cast was nominated for acting Oscars (""Give Em Hell, Harry!"" would be the other; ""Who's Afraid of the Virginia Woolf?"" would be on the list too if they had not undone the inherent claustrophobia of Edward Albee's play with the unnecessary road trip).  However, usually when you are ""remaking"" a play, you stick to the play.  Such is the case with the various versions of classics like ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" where the changes between theBrando-Leigh)version and the one withBaldwin-Langeare relatively minute.  However, what we have here is a reconcpetualization, courtesy of Harold Pinter.  The key change is not simply updating Wyke's toys from games and puzzles to technology, but rather the way Pinter comes up with a totally new ""third"" act.The point of reference for this movie should not be all of the remakes that Hollywood is infatuated with, but those rare reconceputaliations that are done for artistic rather than commercial reasons (the one that came to my mind the most while watching ""Sleuth"" was Akira Kurosawa's transformation of ""King Lear"" into ""Ran"").  In that regard the key member of the production is not director Kenneth Brannagh but screenwriter Harold Pinter.  Getting Pinter to do this script was pivotal, because it is difficult to fault a Nobel Laureate when he wants to reimagine a script like this.  Plus, Pinter has a track record of transforming the works of others, proven once and for all time by his script for ""The French Lieutenant's Woman.""  If playwright Anthony Shaffer were still alive no doubt he would have recruited to update his play, but he passed away in 2001.  In that context getting Pinter (who had seen neither the play nor the movie) was a masterstroke).I am not surprised that things have come full circle with Michael Caine now playing the Laurence Olivier role; we have seen such things before (e.g., Patty Duke going from playingHelen Kellerto playingAnnie Sullivanin ""The Miracle Worker.""  But while Caine's presence gives legitimacy to the proceedings and Jude Law's performance is as fine as anything he has done to date, this ""Sleuth"" is really Pinter's show.  Ultimately, I would maintain that this film is most decidedly not for those who have never seen the original because the ability to appreciate this ""Sleuth"" is predicated on your knowing the original story (notice that this time there are only names of two actors in the opening credits and not three).  The danger here is to be lulled by your familiarity with the story that you ignore the way Pinter has changed things up during the first two ""sets"" to up the ante for the fatal finale.  I still prefer the original as being one of the most effective twists I have seen in a movie (although I am sure it is much more effective on stage), but this one has its moments, most notably in the finale confrontation as Caine and Law engaged in the psychological duel that Pinter has crafted for them.  This version is not as memorable as the original, but I did not expect it to be and I found it worth a look.",4,"Michael Caine returns for the other role in ""Sleuth,"" but Harold Pinter's script is the main attraction this time around",1205625600,"03 16, 2008",2008,3291,"['Given', 'ongoing', 'onslaught', 'remakes', 'films', 'classic', 'trashy', 'Hollywood', 'been', 'overdosing', 'recent', 'years', 'obvious', 'impulse', 'label', 'new', 'version', 'Sleuth', 'remake', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'history', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'nominated', 'acting', 'Oscars', 'Give', 'Em', 'Hell', 'Harry', 'would', 'be', 'other', 'Who', 'Afraid', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'would', 'be', 'list', 'too', 'had', 'not', 'undone', 'inherent', 'claustrophobia', 'Edward', 'Albee', 'play', 'unnecessary', 'road', 'trip', 'However', 'usually', 'when', 'are', 'remaking', 'play', 'stick', 'play', 'Such', 'case', 'various', 'versions', 'classics', 'A', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'where', 'changes', 'theBrando-Leigh', 'version', 'one', 'withBaldwin-Langeare', 'relatively', 'minute', 'However', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'reconcpetualization', 'courtesy', 'Harold', 'Pinter', 'key', 'change', 'not', 'simply', 'updating', 'Wyke', 'toys', 'games', 'puzzles', 'technology', 'rather', 'way', 'Pinter', 'up', 'totally', 'new', 'third', 'act.The', 'point', 'reference', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'remakes', 'Hollywood', 'infatuated', 'rare', 'reconceputaliations', 'are', 'done', 'artistic', 'rather', 'commercial', 'reasons', 'one', 'came', 'mind', 'most', 'watching', 'Sleuth', 'was', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'transformation', 'King', 'Lear', 'Ran', 'regard', 'key', 'member', 'production', 'not', 'director', 'Kenneth', 'Brannagh', 'screenwriter', 'Harold', 'Pinter', 'Getting', 'Pinter', 'do', 'script', 'was', 'pivotal', 'difficult', 'fault', 'Nobel', 'Laureate', 'when', 'reimagine', 'script', 'Pinter', 'track', 'record', 'transforming', 'works', 'others', 'proven', 'once', 'time', 'script', 'French', 'Lieutenant', 'Woman', 'playwright', 'Anthony', 'Shaffer', 'were', 'still', 'alive', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'recruited', 'update', 'play', 'passed', 'away', '2001', 'context', 'getting', 'Pinter', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'neither', 'play', 'movie', 'was', 'masterstroke', '.I', 'am', 'not', 'surprised', 'things', 'have', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'now', 'playing', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'role', 'have', 'seen', 'such', 'things', 'e.g.', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'going', 'playingHelen', 'Kellerto', 'playingAnnie', 'Sullivanin', 'Miracle', 'Worker', 'Caine', 'presence', 'legitimacy', 'proceedings', 'Jude', 'Law', 'performance', 'as', 'fine', 'anything', 'done', 'date', 'Sleuth', 'really', 'Pinter', 'show', 'Ultimately', 'would', 'maintain', 'film', 'most', 'decidedly', 'not', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'ability', 'appreciate', 'Sleuth', 'predicated', 'knowing', 'original', 'story', 'notice', 'time', 'are', 'only', 'names', 'two', 'actors', 'opening', 'credits', 'not', 'three', 'danger', 'here', 'be', 'lulled', 'familiarity', 'story', 'ignore', 'way', 'Pinter', 'changed', 'things', 'up', 'first', 'two', 'sets', 'ante', 'fatal', 'finale', 'still', 'prefer', 'original', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'effective', 'twists', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'am', 'sure', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'stage', 'one', 'moments', 'most', 'notably', 'finale', 'confrontation', 'Caine', 'Law', 'engaged', 'psychological', 'duel', 'Pinter', 'crafted', 'version', 'not', 'as', 'memorable', 'original', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'be', 'found', 'look']",N/A

Jude Law seems to be making a statement by replaying old Michael Caine roles,Alfie (Special Collector's Edition)and now ""Sleuth.""  With two Oscar nominations for ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" in '99 and ""Cold Mountain"" in 03, Law is one of the great working actors.  In this film, he does an excellent job as the somewhat unsure Milo Tindle, the police inspector in disguise and then revealing Milo's sinister emotional underbelly.Quite frankly, it's been years since I watched the Olivier version.  More fresh in my mind is a stage version at East Carolina University where a shot was fired and about four seconds went by until the vase exploded.  The actor turned to the audience and remarked, ""That was a slow bullet!""  So this DVD version comes with me straining to recall the 1972 version for which Michael Caine earned a Best Actor nomination.Caine's career has been celebrated with nominations for ""Alfie"" in 1966, ""Educating Rita"" in 1983, ""The Quiet American"" in 2002, and two Oscars for ""Hannah & Her Sisters"" in 1986 & ""Cider House Rules"" in 1999.  The DVD extras are interesting as Caine describes a minimalist emotional exterior allowing the lines and the audience's imagination to fill in the blanks.  Caine gives a tightly controlled performance as Andrew Wyke.  The difference between his and Olivier's performance is also of note from Caine's perspective in the DVD special features.  I also found it interesting that this was shot in 4 weeks vs. 12 [think I recall that correctly] for the 1972 film.Kenneth Branagh who was named as ""Best New Director"" for ""Henry V"" by the New York Film Critics Circle in 1989 keeps the cat & mouse game between these two characters ever moving and shifting.  The result is a highly cerebral film demanding the viewer constantly focus on subtle shifts.Harold Pinter has had two previous Oscar nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay for ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"" in 1981 and ""Betrayal"" in 1983.  He reshapes the original script with sado-homo-erotic overtones in the last third of the film.  In short, this is the sleaziest of the versions I've seen, which seemed superimposed on the story.Haris Zambarloukos turns in excellent work as cinematographer, keeping the action moving in this one-house set.  I particularly appreciated the opening sequences shot from high in the house looking straight down.

This is a remake of the 1972 film with the same name that stars Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. Caine also appears in the remake, but he plays the Olivier role, and Jude Law takes over as Caine's old character from 35 years ago. The story revolves entirely around a twisted confrontation between eccentric novelist Andrew Wyke (Caine) and Milo Tindle (Law), an out-of-work actor who's having an affair with Tindle's wife. Directed by Kenneth Branagh, who is an absolute genius, this movie is an absolute joy to watch. Everything about it is highly original, even though it's a remake of a classic film...how often can a reviewer make a claim like that?! Caine and Law have an amazing on-screen connection, and both deliver outstanding performances. The screenplay was written by Harold Pinter, who is famous in the world of absurdist theatre. People who are unfamiliar with Pinter's style may be put off by this film, but ""Sleuth"" mirrors Pinter's stage work and is an absolute delight for theatre fans.Unfortunately, the last 15 minutes of the film kind of spin out of control, and the story gets unnecessarily weird for a while.

His Royal Majesty, Kenneth Branagh, directs the movie with a firm hand, and it is very cathartic to watch all this talent go on display.

The young man travels from London (where he was shacked-up with the lady) to the very high-tech home of his nemesis, to gain his consent for a divorce, and an incredibly dangerous game of wits ensues.Of course there's an earlier version of this film, also with Michael Caine (as the cuckoldER!):Sleuth. But I was more reminded of yet another terrific (1982) Michael Caine movie as I watched the 2008 version:Deathtrap, which was based upon an Ira Levin play. One encounters a parallel set of interactions between Caine and a youthful Christopher Reeve as we see between the old Master and Jude Law in the film under review.What can I say about this movie to justify the five stars which I have awarded to it? The acting is stellar, the story is terrific, the cinematography is first-class, and all this gels into a marvelous film. I should additionally point out that the filmscore was clearly extracted fromStokowski: Beethoven Symphony No. 7, Second movement, a loop of four repeated chords from a work which suits the entirety of this unique film.My ""Mousetrap"" allusion in the heading is obviously linked to the famous Agatha Christie play, ""The Mousetrap,"" where there are numerous ""turn-abouts,"" a key feature of this movie.

I also liked the idea that Caine had now taken Olivier's role and Jude Law was the young upstart.  The background was part of the enjoyment for me.  Both Caine and Law are brilliant actors and I had to think that they must have had a wonderful time doing this movie.  I admit that I kept seeing the actors, not the characters.  This version is less realistic, more mannered and although the style suited the cold-bloodedness of the story I think I favored the old-wood warmth of the manor house in the original version.  This was too cold, too blue, too bloodless to engage me in any real sympathy for the characters. Well when I saw that Pinter wrote the script I knew this was not going to be a heartwarmer.  It was sort of like watching a boxing match or a chess game, ego against ego. I found this fascinating in the beginning, especially when the two actors were face to face where we could see the slightest change of expression.The film held me on the edge of my chair for well into the second half.  But after that the appeal began to lag.  Perhaps the sheer nastiness of the characters outweighed any humor or wit that they both displayed in the beginning.  The gay element seemed to bring things to a new low and by the time one of the characters was eliminated I really didn't care about either one of them.The acting is first rate.  Jude law produced it and this was a terrific chance for him to show his stuff. But Caine is showing his age and it's hard to imagine him as a serious contender for the affections of ""Maggie,"" the woman they are fighting over.

1134336,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B001221DTW,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[26, 30]","I don't know if I would go so far as to call the original film version of ""Sleuth"" a classic, but it is a darn good film and features virtuoso performances from Sir Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine.Approximately a year ago, I heard of the plans to remake ""Sleuth"". Groan. Can't they at least try to come up with a new idea in Hollywood? Change the character's names and the title and call something it new? Why mess with a classic? Then, I remembered the original is a very good film, but not a classic. Michael Caine and Jude Law were signed to play the roles Olivier and Caine originated. This could be interesting. Michael Caine appearing in both versions? My interest was piqued. When I heard Kenneth Branagh was directing from a Harold Pinter screenplay, I was hooked.The new version has some good things going for it, but the bad things far outweigh the good making ""Sleuth (2007)"" a disappointment.Milo Tindle (Law), an out-of-work actor, arrives at the estate of Andrew Wyke (Caine), a hugely successful mystery novelist. Wyke has summoned the young man to discuss the affair he is having with his wife. Milo insists Wyke's wife is leaving him and Wyke is only too glad to let her go, he has a mistress of his own. But he wants the separation and divorce to be permanent; he doesn't want his ex-wife running back to him when Milo's money runs out. Wyke suggests Milo `break' into the house and steal some jewels worth One Million Pounds. Wyke has the name of a fence who will give Milo 800,000 pounds for the jewels and that should last them a while. Andrew has thought of everything. Milo agrees and Wyke uses his home's elaborate electronics and surveillance system to guide him through the process, to make it seem real. But it wouldn't seem real unless Wyke found the robber and defended his home would it?""Sleuth"" originated as a play and it showcases two characters who play a game of verbal and psychological cat and mouse, sparring with one another, trying to gain the upper hand. In the new version, there are many changes, many of which benefit the overall film.As Milo drives up to Wyke's house, Branagh introduces us to the elaborate security system the multi-millionaire has installed in his country estate. Milo's car triggers an alarm at the gate and his every move is caught on surveillance camera - there doesn't seem to be a centimeter of the expansive grounds he wouldn't be able to see on one of the system's surveillance screens.As Milo attempts the `break-in', Wyke watches him every step of the way, directing him as he watches his adversary's every move. And Tindle gets caught up in the game, using his acting skills to become a `burglar'.The new version of this film is about half as long as the original was. And this benefits the new film. Because of the length, the original version seems even more stagey; to watch two actors facing off against one another for the entire length of a film running about two and a half hours doesn't help the film escape its stage roots. The new version is about 90 minutes long allowing it to move at a faster clip, giving us less time to think about the fact we are simply watching two actors on screen the whole time.It is also interesting to watch Caine take on the other role in the story. Michael Caine is one of the best actors of our time, but to see him play the other side of the coin provides for an interesting look at his career. He portrays Andrew Wyke in a suitably devious way. As the story progresses, we see shades of his anger, his relief, his amusement, all qualities we would expect to see in a famous mystery novelist.And that is where the benefits of ""Sleuth (2007)"" end.When Milo drives up to the large country estate, we expect the two actors to face off in a huge, expansive maze. The original film provided a huge country house for the two actors to chase each other through. Of course, this provides an advantage to Andrew (played by Olivier in the original) because he knows the various secrets of his expansive home. When Milo (Law) drives up to the estate in this new version, I had high hopes. It appears to be the exact same type of home. Then, he enters the house and we immediately see the hand of Andrew's wife in the ridiculous modern furniture and design. Initially, the house seems unusual and interesting. We soon realize the two actors are moving through a series of four rooms. What happened to the rest of the estate? This setting appears to be little more than a luxury apartment in some swank new building. It seems very small and claustrophobic. And very `play-like'.For a while, the shorter length seems to benefit the film. But as Law's Milo Tindle becomes more engrossed in the story, the actor becomes less and less convincing. Law seems to think he needs to scream, shout and act like an actor in a horror film in order to get his character across, almost as though he is rushing through all of his character's emotions. You could put some orange glaze on Law and serve him at Easter dinner. His hammy performance is even more egregious when you watch him act with Caine. Caine is an accomplished actor and can make even the most over the top performance seem more natural. Andrew is an interesting character and Caine imbues him with calmness, making him more believable. Law, on the other hand, seems possessed by the devil as he grins maniacally and chews the scenery.In the original, Tindle is a hairdresser, in this new version, an out-of-work actor. Yet, oddly, Wyke refers to the younger man as a hairdresser a few times. Is this a mistake? Did Pinter simply forget to replace all of the references to `hairdresser' when he copied the original script? Is this meant to be a put down?If you are going to remake a well-known film, and rework the story, make sure it works. The beauty of the original is it is basically two stories and the two characters change their roles. In the first half, one man has the upper hand. In the second, the other does. In Pinter's version, one man has the upper hand. Then the other. Then later, the other regains the advantage. Oh, wait, maybe not. It goes back and forth, almost on a whim, and the game of cat and mouse loses focus and doesn't make sense. There is also a ludicrous plot development late in the story which does nothing to help Law's performance, only exaggerating all of the bad elements of his style.""Sleuth (2007)"" is a big disappointment. Rent the original and watch two actors at the top of their game spar against one another.",2,It's No Mystery Why This Remake Pales in Comparison,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,6511,"['do', ""n't"",
