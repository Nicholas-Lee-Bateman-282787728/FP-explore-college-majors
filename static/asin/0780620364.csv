30006,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,0780620364,Annie Van Auken,"[4, 4]","The clever TRIAL AND ERROR (1997) stars Jeff Daniels as an attorney who's recently made partner at his prestigious L.A. law firm. Set to marry the boss's daughter in just a few days, Daniels is sent to a tiny Nevada town to request a continuance in a fraud case. His firm's client (Rip Torn) is charged with selling to 65 people ""engraved portraits of President Lincoln"" which are nothing more than shiny new pennies!Daniels arrives in town to find his best friend (Michael Richards) has organized a surprise bachelor party for him. After drinking too much, Daniels says the wrong thing (""I'm an attorney"") to a couple of guys and he gets knocked cold. He's given painkillers and is supposed to take one every three hours but mistakenly takes three every hour.By morning, Daniels is too bombed to appear in court. When he passes out and can't be revived, Richards, an out of work actor, does what he thinks is a ""walk-on."" He pretends to be the lawyer and asks for a continuance but the prosecutor (Jessica Steen) demands that the trial go forward. So now Richards is trapped and must continue the charade of being Torn's attorney.This is a very humorous movie, with great rapport between Daniels and Richards, Richards and Steen and Daniels and Charlize Theron, who plays a waitress that Jeff falls in love with.Best of all however is Austin Pendleton, the judge. He steals every scene he's in and gets the film's biggest laugh. After sitting in frustration through a farce of a trial ineptly conducted by the bumbling Richards, and having to listen to the perjuring Torn's bizarre life story which includes a pumpkin costume, a fire on Lake Michigan and an orphanage, once closing arguments have been presented the dyspeptic Pendleton clearly brightens and with a toothy grin announces to no one in particular: ""Well, this trial is almost over!"" In print it doesn't seem at all funny, but you have to see this moment in context with the entire courtroom fiasco.If you've yet to see TRIAL AND ERROR, you're in for a real treat when you do!

30010,A1LBF5XZNYD6QR,0780620364,Brett Johnson,"[11, 14]","Most of the best moments in ""Trial And Error"" involve the more romantic side of the movie.  It doesn't do nearly as well when it tries to be funny.  Too much emphasis is put on Michael Richards being goofy and stumbling all over the place.  The plot involves a lawyer (Jeff Daniels) who has his bachelor party the night before he has to appear in court.  Unfortunately, he ends up drunk and in a bar fight. He is then unable to represent his client due to a combination of a horrible hangover and a bunch of pills he took to try and feel better.  His friend (Michael Richards), an actor, poses as a lawyer and asks for a continuance of the case.  His motion is denied and the film relies on the old ""fish out of water"" routine to draw laughs.  The actor has to keep pretending to be the actual lawyer for the case and is forced into a trial situation.  Richards does a slight variation of his ""Seinfeld"" character and bumbles his way through the movie.  It's okay but nothing that hasn't been seen before.  Daniels plays the same ol' smug loser that he usually plays.  This movie is completely stolen by the women.  Charlize Theron is simply charming as a local waitress who falls for the engaged Daniels.  She really lights up the screen and makes the viewer truly care about what happens to her.  Jennifer Coolidge plays a witness during the trial and she was given the funniest lines in the script.  Her testimony provides several laugh out loud moments.  ""Trial And Error"" focused too much on a one-joke plot about an actor having to pretend to be an attorney and it loses its novelty early.  Luckily, the romantic side story helps keep the viewer interested and Coolidge makes things fun in the courtroom.  Overall, a pleasant movie to help pass a couple of hours that leaves you feeling good at the end.",3,WORKS BETTER AS A ROMANCE.,1011744000,"01 23, 2002",2002,1809,"['Most', 'best', 'moments', 'Trial', 'Error', 'involve', 'more', 'romantic', 'side', 'movie', ""n't"", 'do', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'be', 'funny', 'Too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'put', 'Michael', 'Richards', 'being', 'goofy', 'stumbling', 'place', 'plot', 'lawyer', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'who', 'bachelor', 'party', 'night', 'appear', 'court', 'Unfortunately', 'up', 'drunk', 'bar', 'fight', 'then', 'unable', 'represent', 'client', 'due', 'combination', 'horrible', 'hangover', 'bunch', 'pills', 'took', 'try', 'feel', 'better', 'friend', 'Michael', 'Richards', 'actor', 'lawyer', 'continuance', 'case', 'motion', 'denied', 'film', 'relies', 'old', 'fish', 'water', 'routine', 'draw', 'laughs', 'actor', 'keep', 'pretending', 'be', 'actual', 'lawyer', 'case', 'forced', 'trial', 'situation', 'Richards', 'slight', 'variation', 'Seinfeld', 'character', 'way', 'movie', 'okay', 'nothing', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'Daniels', 'same', 'ol', 'smug', 'loser', 'usually', 'movie', 'completely', 'stolen', 'women', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'simply', 'charming', 'local', 'waitress', 'who', 'engaged', 'Daniels', 'really', 'up', 'screen', 'viewer', 'truly', 'care', 'what', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'witness', 'trial', 'was', 'given', 'funniest', 'lines', 'script', 'testimony', 'several', 'out', 'loud', 'moments', 'Trial', 'Error', 'focused', 'too', 'much', 'one-joke', 'plot', 'actor', 'having', 'pretend', 'be', 'attorney', 'novelty', 'early', 'Luckily', 'romantic', 'side', 'story', 'keep', 'viewer', 'interested', 'Coolidge', 'things', 'fun', 'courtroom', 'Overall', 'pleasant', 'movie', 'help', 'pass', 'couple', 'hours', 'feeling', 'good', 'end']",N/A

Michael Richards ( aka Kramer on Seinfeld) is a knockout in this romantic comedy. I love the scenes in the courtroom where the clients object , the judge sustains the objection or overrules it and so on. and then towards the end Jeff Daniels in his role gets his life on better track. where as at the beginning. he gets wasted, beat up, and his partner friend has to pretend he's the lawyer, who does a half ass job at it.

Charlize Theron, here in pre-Oscar winning days, plays the love interest of Daniels, as she helps him appreciate life and love in a new way.  She adds emotional depth to the plot.

There are a lot of &quot;hidden&quot; messages that one must take into consideration when watching this film.For one thing, considering that Michael Richards was able to act as an attorney in a real case (even though he was really just an actor), it gives the impression that effective counsel is not as hard as it actually is.  That is fine, but it is an interesting point: are lawyers just actors?  And if that is so, can one be taught the rules of evidence, civil procedure, and all other legal frameworks in less than three years?Secondly, it is quite interesting how Jeff Daniels ends up dumping his Beverly Hills wife for a small town waitress.  His wife in the movie was a shrill and annoying lady.  My question is: How can someone end up enganged to a bit mouth like that?  Did he want to marry her because there was no one else available, and thus he choose the lesser or two evils -- until, that is, he finds the small town waitress?  It certainly is an interesting dillema.This movie has great timing and it is quite fascinating.  One of the best scenes in this movie include Michael Richards pretending to be an attorney in court, which actually looks far better than some real attorneys practicing cases.  Most of the time he was quite confident, until in the end, which he does something quite differently, but I don't want to reveal it because it will ruin the ending. ; 0--Michael Gordon",4,Original Story and Keen Sense of Originality,1068249600,"11 8, 2003",2003,1510,"['ironic', 'film', 'romantic', 'film', 'comedy', 'bit', 'hybrid', 'molding', 'together', 'are', 'lot', 'quot', 'quot', 'messages', 'one', 'must', 'take', 'consideration', 'when', 'watching', 'film.For', 'one', 'thing', 'considering', 'Michael', 'Richards', 'was', 'able', 'act', 'attorney', 'real', 'case', 'even', 'was', 'really', 'just', 'actor', 'impression', 'effective', 'counsel', 'not', 'as', 'hard', 'actually', 'fine', 'interesting', 'point', 'are', 'lawyers', 'just', 'actors', 'so', 'can', 'one', 'be', 'taught', 'rules', 'evidence', 'civil', 'procedure', 'other', 'legal', 'frameworks', 'less', 'three', 'years', 'Secondly', 'quite', 'interesting', 'how', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'up', 'dumping', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'wife', 'small', 'town', 'waitress', 'wife', 'movie', 'was', 'shrill', 'annoying', 'lady', 'question', 'How', 'can', 'someone', 'end', 'up', 'enganged', 'bit', 'mouth', 'Did', 'want', 'marry', 'was', 'one', 'else', 'available', 'thus', 'choose', 'lesser', 'two', 'evils', 'small', 'town', 'waitress', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'dillema.This', 'movie', 'great', 'timing', 'quite', 'fascinating', 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'movie', 'include', 'Michael', 'Richards', 'pretending', 'be', 'attorney', 'court', 'actually', 'far', 'better', 'real', 'attorneys', 'practicing', 'cases', 'Most', 'time', 'was', 'quite', 'confident', 'end', 'something', 'quite', 'differently', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'reveal', 'will', 'ruin', 'ending', '0', 'Michael', 'Gordon']",N/A

But it does tell a good story about the fact that we all hide parts of ourselves that are ""under construction"" and which we are none-too-proud of at the moment. What endeared this film to me was the gorgeous local of the Owens Valley, CA. Shot in Big Pine and Independence with the spring snow clinging to Mt. Williamson (14,000 ft) in the background, the cinematographer had a field day capturing the Eastern Sierra Nevada crest in almost every frame. The Independence Court House was perfect as a nowhere's-ville ""hick"" county jurisdiction HQ. Owens Valley sits on the border with Nevada so it fits with the story well.

30023,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,0780620364,T O'Brien,"[13, 15]","Trial and Error is a funny movie that cannot make up its mind whether it is a physical or romantic comedy.  Charlie Tuttle is a well-to-do lawyer with everything you could possibly want.  However, when he gets drunk at a bachelor party and cannot go to court the next morning his actor friend, Ricky, must step in for him at the case.  When Ricky realizes that what he has done is a felony, the two friends must figure a way out of the sticky situation.  Watching Michael Richards as Ricky is pretty funny as he continuously stumbles across the courtroom.  The problem with the movie is that it can't make up its mind what it is about.  It constantly bounces back and forth between the courtroom scene and Charlie's efforts to find himself.  Either way, it still has its moments and is worth a watch.Michael Richards is very funny as Rickey Rjetti, the actor pretending to be a lawyer to help his friend.  This character is basically Kramer with some morals involved.  Jeff Daniels is also good as Charlie Tuttle, Rickey's friend who finds himself in quite a little predicament.  Trial and Error also stars Charlize Theron(looking great), Rip Torn, Jessica Steen, Austin Pendleton, and Jennifer Coolidge.  The DVD offers fullscreen and widescreen presentations, theatrical trailers, and production notes.
