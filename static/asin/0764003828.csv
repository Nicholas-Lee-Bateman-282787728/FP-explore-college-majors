In this film we can see the outlines of Woody's seemingly endless love affair with early black and white crime and film noir classics. There is a little more use of sight gags here than in latter films but through it all Woody is still the funny bumbling New York Jewish kid that a long series of films will explore in greater detail. The use of an old time newsreel announcer to describe and set the framework of the film and detail the action is an interesting twist.

2288,A20IIR0422G3A5,0764003828,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[3, 4]","`Take the Money and Run' is the very first movie where Woody Allen is writer, director, and star, and true to the first film in any artist's series of work, it may be the his best up to `Annie Hall', his seventh film as writer/director/star and arguably his very best comedy. `Love and Death' and `Bananas' may a little weak. `Play It Again, Sam' has the first writing and direction where the audience develops some empathy with the characters, so it presages the more serious business of the later films. But `Take the Money and Run' is simply nonstop silliness, with some of the longest and best running gags this side of Mel Brooks.Even this very first movie has many of Allen's trademarks. For a relatively low budget movie, the quality of the music is very, very good, with original pieces contributed by the up and coming Marvin Hamlisch. Even though the supporting cast is not filled with a lot of highly recognizable actors, most of the faces such as the chain gang supervisor all seem to have a vaguely familiar look about them. Allen's female lead is Janet Margolin, for whom this is probably the highlight of her career. His `Bananas' costar, Louise Lasser, later of `Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman' appears in a very small role.Two other trademark motifs are the flashbacks to boyhood and the cut-aways to interviews with the principle character's parents. These devices appear in `Annie Hall' and even in the relatively serious `Crimes and Misdemeanors' plus several other films.Another typical aspect of this movie is that it is a parody of documentaries, although not with such loving artfulness as Allen does in `Zelig'.One thing that is entirely absent is any intellectuality. I can't recall any joke for which you need to read a Russian novel or see a classic silent movie to understand. While it strikes me that poor Virgil Starkwell does have some mock heroic aspects which may have been borrowed from `Don Quixote' or `Candide', I think that may be my seeing things of which Allen had no inkling.Allen has claimed, contrary to a lot of other artists' statements, that comedy is easy. Allen is so adept in this movie at spinning off high quality jokes at such a rate that he genuinely makes it seem effortless. And yet, like the proverbial Chinese meal, you leave this movie and an hour later, you are `still hungry'. That is, you take away no warm feelings for any characters and their situations or any satisfaction that a hero succeeded in a quest or a heavy got their just deserts.Some movies have compared Allen's work to the Marx brothers. In the sense that I suspect the Marx brothers have inoculated every American comedian since their heyday, I suppose there is something there. I suggest that W. C. Fields much more directly influences Allen. While the Marx brothers used a great deal of visual humor, Fields was a true poet of the illusion of clumsiness, created with his major skill as a juggler. Allen parodies some of Fields' great moves with a pool cue. While Allen can't hold a candle to Fields' dexterity, the result is still pretty funny.My primary recommendation for people who may like some but not all of Allen's films, this one should definitely be in your collection, whether you just like his `early, funny' movies or prefer all his styles, but want to skip over some of the darker, less well written, or less interesting works.",5,First triple threat from the Woodman.

The world has become so much cruder and the language so much more coarse that this feels much like a family film today.  It is funny, yes, but some of it feels dated.  Comedy is often tied to its time and doesn't travel to a later time so well.  Yet, much of the movie remains terrific and classic.  There are many lines that have become part of the language (""it is if you're doing it right"", for example).  Just go up to anyone who knows the film and say ""abt natural"" or ""I have a gub"" and they will likely begin to chuckle.  And, of course, there is the soap and shoe polish gun in the rain.It is also nice to see Janet Margolin in one of her best roles as the female lead, Louise, Virgil's eternally loyal girlfriend.  She was taken far too young by ovarian cancer, but this role is a great one to remember her by.For those who haven't seen the movie, Woody Allen plays Virgil Starkwell, a really down and out kid, what is a nerd called if they are also stupid?  That's Virgil.  He loves playing the cello, but without the least spark of talent.  He tries to play the cello in a marching band.  He turns to crime with even less ability than he has for the cello.  Of course, like all stupid people, he gets himself into worse trouble because he actually thinks he knows what he is doing.  However, he is also aware that nothing works out for him, but thinks it is basically bad breaks even though he understands he has no abilities whatsoever.  That mix of self-awareness and yet being completely unaware is the source of much of the humor.

Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[4, 4]","Compare this film to any other Woody Allen movie and you will see why it is the best and most solid work he ever did.His leading lady is also the sweetest, most beautiful, noble while still just a bit not-all-there ethereal beauty he ever starred with, and then she disappeared into the Sixties haze.THe gags are great, although through getting frequently stolen now fall flat in some cases. For instance when this was made having an escaping chain gang member respond to Woody's ""You're crazy!"" (of course later in his pretentious later movies he would have said You're insane) it was out of left field for the low life con to reply ""That's right! I'm a paranoid schizophrenic, but we're still going to escape!"" as the terminology was unknown to almost everyone back then. Also the reference to a high speed digital computer. Now it is not unusual for his aunt to have one, and the reference to What's my line? is lost now.

As if he would have to apologize for this instead of, say, ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"".  What Allen attempted here in his directorial debut is groundbreaking.  This is the first example I can recall of a director telling his film in mock-documentary style, later employed by Albert Brooks and perfected by Christopher Guest.  Allen proves himself to be not only a great comic visualist but there are great verbal puns here as well.  The conceit of the film is a gas.  We're supposed to believe that Allen's Virgil Starkwell, an inept dweeb of a criminal, if not among the FBI's most wanted does cause Mr. Hoover some sleepless nights.  The gags here are rapidfire but I wouldn't spoil it for those who are uninitiated.  My favorite being,though, is Virgil orchestrating a prison break with a gun he's fashioned out of soap during a rainstorm.  All this failed effort leaves him with is a hand full of soap lather.  Also, noteworthy in the cast is the late Janet Margolin as Virgil's faithful wife.

Neil Simon will make the list, along with Mel Brooks, and Woody Allen. There are others, of course. Together they make up one of the most remarkable flowerings of comic talent in American history. Woody's talent sprang from him fully formed. His basic gift is in full evidence in this early picture. It is debatable that he has improved with age, although it is worth noting that his exposure, like Harold Pinter's, to elegant, bourgeois life permanently altered the objects of his comic study. Mia Farrow introduced him to the good life, to aristocratic penthouse life, and there was no turning back. Still, his genius can be seen in his ability to adjust and move on. Later Woody is every bit as good as his early work, but not necessarily better, unless you happen to like posh talk and that very special boredom of the urban bourgeoisie. This early picture, though lacking in elegant settings and posh-talk, is vintage; here we having that wonderful skewering of pieties that one remembers from the Marx Brothers. Woody is wonderful at exposing pretensions, great and small. Here he plays a small-time hoodlum, a kind of Sylvester Stallone, played as a clumsy oaf, a loser, and nebbishy klutz, with eyes for the gals. Groucho, where are you? The film is a work of genius.

2299,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0764003828,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 3]","Long before Christopher Guest mastered the genre, Woody Allen made a comic mockumentary of the life of a failed bank robber named Virgil Starkwell complete with newsreel footage, excerpts from interviews with people in his life (including his embarrassed parents in Groucho Marx masks) and a stentorian voiceover narration by Jackson Beck. This fitfully funny 1969 comedy marks Allen's feature film debut as a triple threat - director, writer (with early partner Mickey Rose) and star, and it shows the earmarks of his later visual style even if the laughs are not always there.Lacking an actual storyline, the movie takes us through Starkwell's life from shoplifting bubblegum machines as a youngster to bank robberies to finding the ideal woman to prison and so on and so on. This is Allen at his purest with focus on often hilarious sight gags and self-deprecating one-liners without his later forays into the complexities of the human condition. In fact, this is probably the only time that Allen has played a screen character without any intellectual pretensions. The closest he comes is pretending to be a cellist with the Philharmonic to the girl of his dreams, a pretty laundress named Louise. The best gags are probably the prison shirt-folding machine, the bank robbery where Starkwell's badly handwritten note is passed around the staff to interpret, the escaped chain gang coming into the old woman's house, the prison vaccine experiment that turns Starkwell into a Hassidic rabbi, and my favorite, the totally impossible scene where he drives a car inside a blackmailing woman's house chasing her around.Of less interest is the romance between Starkwell and Louise, who is portrayed as self-conscious and rather mealy-mouthed. Allen's usual generosity with actresses has not yet developed at this point, and Janet Margolin is forced to play Louise quite passively despite her beauty. For a movie that is supposed to take place between the 1940's through the early 1960's, it certainly looks and feels like hippie-era 1969, especially with the Austin Powers-style music over the chase scenes. Allen's first wife Louise Lasser (yes, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman) has a funny cameo as an early girlfriend.

Take the Money And Run was Woody Allen's first real film to direct himself and it remains one of his funniest.  Disguised as a documentary, this 1969 film tells the hilarious story of Virgil Starkweather, the world's most inept (if stupidly optomistic) thief.  Like most of Woody Allen's early films, everything is played almost solely for the laughs it might provide and nearly forty years later, it all holds up very well.  Lots of hilarious stuff in here (at times, this film is the funniest Mel Brooks film that Mel Brooks never made) but my personal favorite bits would have to include: Virgil's parents who disguise their indentities by wearing Groucho Marx glasses but will be familiar to anyone whose seen any of Allen's films, Virgil's attempt to rob a bank is foiled when none of the clerks can read his bad handwriting, another robbery goes wrong when a rival gang decides to rob the same bank at the same time, Virgil's attempt to escape from prison by making a fake gun out of soap is ruined when it starts to rain, the sight of Woody Allen on a southern chain gang (and being punished by being locked in the hole with an insurance salesman), and especially the scene where a man Virgil attempts to mug turns out to be not only a childhood school friend but an undercover cop as well.  Directing with a wild-anything-goes-spirit, Woody Allen gives one of his first (and best) ""born loser"" performances as Virgil.  Amongst all the madness, the film also presents a bizarrely sweet love story between Virgil and his wife, who is well-played by the lovely (and the sadly no longer with us) Janet Margolin.  Always underappreciated, Margolin was one of those forgotten, at times almost painfully vulnerable actresses that one can't help but fall in love with everytime she appears on screen. Though overshadowed by the later Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow, Janet Margolin was Woody Allen's first unlikely love interest (in both film and briefly real life) and they have a strong chemistry together that adds much heart to a wild film.

Check out some of the other reviews here, which recount a few of the better sight gags and funny scenarios to see what I mean.  Just be warned, though, that Woody still had a way to go before the jokes got really sharp and the storylines moved with supreme smoothness.  I don't want to overstate the criticism, as ""Take the Money and Run"" never sinks to boredom, or choppiness in the story telling.  It's just that Woody's best period was still three or four films ahead of him at this point and a certain lack of polish is still evident.  But the movie is still definitely worth a look, even though I'm not as big a fan of it as some other folks.Unfortunately, the full-frame version of ""Take the Money and Run"" is the one most easily available on DVD in this country.  On the plus side, however, I noticed no obvious and offensive cropping of the image while I watched the movie (though I guess something must have been cropped somewhere to create the full-frame image).  Also on the plus side, the print is sharp, clear, and bright.But, alas, like most DVDs of Woody's films, there are basically no extras, just a trailer.

He begins a life of crime by robbing an armored car, but is quickly caught. In prison, he models a fake gun and tries an unsuccessful escape. Later, in exchange for a pardon, he volunteers for an experimental vaccine, the only side effect is turning him into a rabbi for a few hours. From time to time, his parents are interviewed (wearing  Groucho Marx disguises). Finally released, he rents a room. He then begins another life of crime with purse snatching and small robberies.Intending to steal her purse, Virgil meets a young woman, Louise, who is a laundress, and is smitten. He narrates his nauseous nature when in love. He robs a soda machine for money and goes to dinner on a date with Louise. Now he is in love. Virgil tries to rob a bank - but can't write a legible holdup note, and gets arrested and put back in prison, where he gets visits from Louise. Although she says she will wait for Virgil, he plans an escape. The warden gets wind of the plan, so the escaping group calls it off but forgets to tell Virgil, who tries it alone, and improbably escapes.Virgil and Louise get married, and later Louise gets pregnant. Virgil wants to go straight and tries to get job as insurance agent, but is hired instead for the mailroom. He is ferreted out by a co-worker and is blackmailed. Virgil contemplates murdering her, but is unsuccessful in every attempt, including stabbing her with a turkey leg, but finally is accidentally lucky with the exploding candlesticks.Petty crimes follow in his life on the run. He thinks up another bank robbery plot, and unwittingly tells some cops about it but is not arrested. When it comes time to rob the bank, his group is confronted by rival robbers. They are caught, and Virgil gets put in a chain-gang. The group manages to escape while chained together with help from Louise. They are off on a life of crime again, and Virgil makes the ""Gangster of the Year"" award. He unwittingly robs a former marching band member, who is now a cop, and is arrested again. He is interviewed in captivity, while working on his next soap-gun.While a little rough around the edges, the movie has some charm and a few giggles. The narrator delivers his lines in a serious manner, even when the subject matter may not be.

Even early on in his film career, Woody Allen shows genius and promise to grow much, much further than most artists ever go. The film's plot moves along at a good pace and the acting increases the quality of the movie--and the jokes.The film, as you may well know, is a spoof of documentaries called a ""mockumentary."" The film purports to show the life and times of a petty criminal named Virgil Starkwell (Woody Allen). We see him being bullied by his childhood peers on the streets and his failure at playing the cello signals his failure to become a successful criminal.The film is essentially one gag after another in rapid fire. We see Virgil fail at bank robbery after bank robbery; perhaps the funniest is when Virgil and his buddies try to rob a bank when another gang wants to rob the same bank on the same day. We also see Virgil fall in love with beautiful Louise (Janet Margolin). Janet plays Louise with a great deal of realism and her matter-of fact attitude toward Virgil's bank robbing is comical as well.In order to make Take The Money And Run feel even more like a documentary, we get ""interviews"" with Virgil's parents (who wear Groucho Marx glasses to disguise themselves) and teachers and acquaintances who knew Virgil. The acting is excellent.The DVD doesn't offer too many extras but the movie is so well done that I will give this a five star rating anyway.Take The Money And Run is sure to give you a laugh--in fact, you'll be laughing all the way. The ""mockumentary"" style of the film enhances its comedic effect.

However, there's something to be said for films like What's Up, Tiger Lily, Play it Again, Sam and Sleeper -- films that are just plain funny. Probably the best of these is Take the Money and Run which spoofs the true crime documentaries of the time. Allen plays Virgil Starkwell, a hilariously inept career criminal whose life is one misadventure after another. Using ""testimony"" from people in Starkwell's life and cinema vierte style photography, Allen peppers the audience with hilarious sight gag after sight gag. Among my favorites:1. In high school, Starkwell joins the marching band ... as a cello player. The image of Allen running up the street with chair and cello in hand, stopping for a moment to play a few bars, then getting up and running a few more feet in hysterically funny.2. Starkwell invites his girlfriend (played by Janet Margolin of ""David and Lisa"") to dinner but doesn't have the money. He breaks into several parking meters. When he tips the maitre'd, he dumps several dollars in change into his hand and all over the floor.3. Starkwell robs a bank, but the teller can't read the note he hands him, thinking that the word ""gun"" is ""gub.""4. When entering prison, one of the guards frisks Starkwell, inducing peals of ticklish laughter.Indeed, Take the Money and Run seems a lot more like a film by Allen's former colleague on Your Show of Shows, Mel Brooks, than like one of his later films.

2321,A27PSZX2SE0B51,0764003828,Mike Stone,"[4, 17]","""Take the Money and Run"" will not entertain or humour those of us familiar with the rest of Woody Allen's sparkling oeuvre. Its only real value is as a curiosity.This is Woody establishing his template for later movies, i.e., nebbishy loser, a failure at his chosen occupation, acquires an impossibly beautiful girlfriend, and tries to do right.The mockumentary style he chooses to utilize for the most part works nicely. At times, though, its tone feels uneven, floating from documentary to narrative fiction and back to documentary. If he had stuck to one style the power of the satire would be much stronger. And now that I think of it, choosing to do an obviously mannered genre parody with your first film is somewhat dubious. It sent him on a path that would lead to the well-meaning but uneven films ""Bananas"" and ""Sleeper"". Not till ""Love and Death"" would he make a film where the parody serves the story rather than the story serving the parody.While most of the jokes feel forced, there are some truly hilarious proto-Woody moments. The marching band scene (with Woody gamely trying to keep up while tugging along his cello and a chair) knocked me down flat with laughter. And a moment late in the film, with Woody trying to conduct a substantive interview with a rambling subject (Woody keeps saying ""Get to the point"" from behind the camera), is a most effective moment in terms of parodying the documentary form. But other than these, and few others, I was disappointed by the humour. A running gag, where Woody's glasses repeatedly get stomped on by authority figures, was flat the first time I saw it and got flatter each subsequent time.This film is definitely at the bottom of my personal list of favourite Woody Allen movies. It may be because I prefer his dexterous verbal wit to the juvenile sight gags and physical humour he employs here, or that he had yet to find his footing with this, his first outing. Either way, if you take a pass on ""Take the Money and Run"", you won't be missing too much.",3,"In the beginning, Woody created a schlock mockumentary",997660800,"08 13, 2001",2001,2018,"['Take', 'Money', 'Run', 'will', 'not', 'entertain', 'humour', 'familiar', 'rest', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'sparkling', 'oeuvre', 'only', 'real', 'value', 'curiosity.This', 'Woody', 'establishing', 'template', 'later', 'movies', 'i.e.', 'nebbishy', 'loser', 'failure', 'chosen', 'occupation', 'impossibly', 'beautiful', 'girlfriend', 'tries', 'do', 'right.The', 'mockumentary', 'style', 'utilize', 'most', 'part', 'nicely', 'times', 'though', 'tone', 'feels', 'uneven', 'floating', 'documentary', 'narrative', 'fiction', 'back', 'documentary', 'had', 'stuck', 'one', 'style', 'power', 'satire', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'stronger', 'now', 'think', 'choosing', 'do', 'obviously', 'mannered', 'genre', 'parody', 'first', 'film', 'somewhat', 'dubious', 'sent', 'path', 'would', 'lead', 'well-meaning', 'uneven', 'films', 'Bananas', 'Sleeper', 'Not', 'Love', 'Death', 'would', 'make', 'film', 'where', 'parody', 'story', 'rather', 'story', 'serving', 'parody.While', 'most', 'jokes', 'feel', 'forced', 'are', 'truly', 'hilarious', 'proto-Woody', 'moments', 'marching', 'band', 'scene', 'Woody', 'gamely', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'tugging', 'cello', 'chair', 'knocked', 'down', 'flat', 'laughter', 'moment', 'late', 'film', 'Woody', 'trying', 'conduct', 'substantive', 'interview', 'rambling', 'subject', 'Woody', 'saying', 'Get', 'point', 'camera', 'most', 'effective', 'moment', 'terms', 'parodying', 'documentary', 'form', 'other', 'few', 'others', 'was', 'disappointed', 'humour', 'running', 'gag', 'where', 'Woody', 'glasses', 'repeatedly', 'get', 'stomped', 'authority', 'figures', 'was', 'flat', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'got', 'flatter', 'subsequent', 'time.This', 'film', 'definitely', 'bottom', 'personal', 'list', 'favourite', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'may', 'be', 'prefer', 'dexterous', 'verbal', 'wit', 'juvenile', 'sight', 'gags', 'physical', 'humour', 'here', 'had', 'yet', 'find', 'footing', 'first', 'outing', 'way', 'take', 'pass', 'Take', 'Money', 'Run', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'missing', 'too', 'much']",Take the Money and Run VHS

The film is done in a documentary style, telling the story of Virgil Starkwell, an incompentent petty criminal, played by Woody of course.To pick a favourite moment out is difficult. However, if forced to pick one I'd go for the scene where Virgil tries to rob a bank, and fails because he hands over a note where the word gun can easily be mistaken for gub. Consequently the entire bank staff and customers are all arguing whether the word is gun or gub. Woody insists its gun; everybody else thinks its gub...This is definitely one of Woody's early funny ones!",4,Classy debut,1189900800,"09 16, 2007",2007,734,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'stars', 'directs', 'first', 'time', 'what', 'success', 'out', 'be', 'are', 'many', 'great', 'sight', 'gags', 'as', 'well', 'usual', 'number', 'quality', 'one-liners', 'film', 'done', 'documentary', 'style', 'telling', 'story', 'Virgil', 'Starkwell', 'incompentent', 'petty', 'criminal', 'played', 'Woody', 'course.To', 'pick', 'favourite', 'moment', 'out', 'difficult', 'However', 'forced', 'pick', 'one', ""'d"", 'go', 'scene', 'where', 'Virgil', 'rob', 'bank', 'fails', 'note', 'where', 'word', 'gun', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'mistaken', 'gub', 'Consequently', 'entire', 'bank', 'staff', 'customers', 'are', 'arguing', 'word', 'gun', 'gub', 'Woody', 'gun', 'everybody', 'else', 'gub', 'definitely', 'one', 'Woody', 'early', 'funny', 'ones']",Take the Money and Run VHS

By no means does it have the depth and sophistication of his later work, but it's consistently funny, with one gag running into the next, and there are teasing moments of that blur between fantasy and reality that characterized his films.The story concerns one Virgil Starkwell, a bespectacled failure who resorts to crime for a living, and can't even be a success at that. He tries to stage a bank robbery, but it flops when the tellers start arguing over whether his handwritten note says ""I have a gub"" or ""I have a gun"".
