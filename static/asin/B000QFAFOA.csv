My daughter and I were discussing this and agreed that Brown points out some of the meaningful things to do in each city and warns her audience about some of the touristy things, all the while keeping her show entertaining.  I've been to Brussels, Amsterdam and Barcelona, and thought she did a terrific job with them.  Of course I could whine that she didn't mention the fantastic art museum in Brussels, or the amazing museum of musical instruments; I could be horrified that she said not one word about the fantastic Parc Guell in Barcelona.  But why complain when Brown has whetted my appetite for the enjoyment of a place.  Perhaps the test for me is her show on Prague: I've never been there.  By the time she was five minutes into her tour of Prague, I couldn't wait to buy a Fodor guide and start planning a trip there.My usual travelling companion swears by Rick Steves; I get nothing out of him.

Samantha Brown also spends some time showing each of the hotels she is staying in, chats with locals, eats some food and looks at Cathedrals, historical buildings and museums.  The hotels she stays at and the way she travels is definitely on a high budget and she can spend a lot more then most people.  The architecture in these cities shown in the DVD is amazing.If you like travel shows and/or are interested in learning more about Europe and some interesting places to visit, this is a good DVD. Samantha is a fun host and is likeable.

1075429,A3MBC0WNEAP7AS,B000QFAFOA,Leonard,"[0, 0]","Samantha Brown is hit or miss. Samantha Brown behind door #1 is exciting and adventurous. Samantha Brown behind door #2 is an annoying airhead. The problem is that you don't know which one you're getting until you buy the DVD. I enjoyed her Singapore episode. Her London episodes were good, but could've been better. Her Paris and Japan episodes were horrible.I bought this DVD solely for the Amsterdam and Madrid episodes- I didn't care about the other cities. In the Amsterdam episode, she showed the city's beautiful canals and parks. She also visited the Anne Frank museum. That was the only time that I ever saw Samantha speak in a somber tone. Samantha really shocked me when she went to a ""coffee shop"" towards the end of the episode as well as the Red Light District. Prior to this episode, I thought of her as a blonde Rachael Ray.The Madrid episode began with her riding this high speed train. Madrid is an underrated city. It's actually larger than Paris, but not as popular. She went to the Plaza Mayor, which is an outdoor plaza full of shops and restaurants. Samantha made the mistake of stopping by when it was raining and the place was empty. That's why I subtracted one star. She also visited the Prado Museum and this nice looking park. The funniest part of the episode was when she bought cookies from the nuns. The episode concluded with her showing Madrid's exciting nightlife.I didn't watch the other episodes but if you're just interested in Amsterdam and Madrid, buy this DVD.",4,Fun and exciting,1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,1500,"['Samantha', 'Brown', 'hit', 'miss', 'Samantha', 'Brown', 'door', '1', 'exciting', 'adventurous', 'Samantha', 'Brown', 'door', '2', 'annoying', 'airhead', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', ""'re"", 'getting', 'buy', 'DVD', 'enjoyed', 'Singapore', 'episode', 'London', 'episodes', 'were', 'good', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'Paris', 'Japan', 'episodes', 'were', 'horrible.I', 'bought', 'DVD', 'solely', 'Amsterdam', 'Madrid', 'episodes-', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'other', 'cities', 'Amsterdam', 'episode', 'showed', 'city', 'beautiful', 'canals', 'parks', 'also', 'visited', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'museum', 'was', 'only', 'time', 'ever', 'saw', 'Samantha', 'speak', 'somber', 'tone', 'Samantha', 'really', 'shocked', 'when', 'went', 'coffee', 'shop', 'end', 'episode', 'as', 'well', 'Red', 'Light', 'District', 'Prior', 'episode', 'thought', 'blonde', 'Rachael', 'Ray.The', 'Madrid', 'episode', 'began', 'riding', 'high', 'speed', 'train', 'Madrid', 'underrated', 'city', 'actually', 'larger', 'Paris', 'not', 'popular', 'went', 'Plaza', 'Mayor', 'outdoor', 'plaza', 'full', 'shops', 'restaurants', 'Samantha', 'made', 'mistake', 'stopping', 'when', 'was', 'raining', 'place', 'was', 'empty', 'why', 'subtracted', 'one', 'star', 'also', 'visited', 'Prado', 'Museum', 'nice', 'looking', 'park', 'funniest', 'part', 'episode', 'was', 'when', 'bought', 'cookies', 'nuns', 'episode', 'concluded', 'showing', 'Madrid', 'exciting', 'nightlife.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'other', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'just', 'interested', 'Amsterdam', 'Madrid', 'buy', 'DVD']",Passport to Europe: Seven Fabulous Cities

1075431,A3FDBBQ0NK2SSO,B000QFAFOA,"takingadayoff ""takingadayoff""","[4, 5]","This was my introduction to Passport to Europe with Samantha Brown. I have long been a Rick Steves fan, but lately he has been putting more and more emphasis on visiting churches and this is not one of my interests as a tourist. So when someone recommended Samantha Brown, I remembered that our local library has some of her DVDs.These seven episodes have just the degree of superficial touristy fun that I was looking for. Samantha Brown is an easy-to-take guide who seems to be having a good time. Her commentary is a little goofy sometimes, but she seems to realize it and doesn't mind laughing at herself.Since these shows were made for the Travel Channel, they are more commercial than Rick Steves' public TV-oriented programs. Samantha shows us her hotel in each city, taking care to emphasize the name and location. And, as another viewer noted, ""She always shows the bathroom."" There is also a close-up of her shoes in every episode, and usually another accessory (handbag, raincoat) will feature. You won't catch her wearing boring walking shoes or a local sweatshirt. Check the credits and you'll discover that those shoes are paying for her trip.In spite of these obvious commercial plugs, I found the episodes to be pleasant and informative. In addition to the usual tourist sites that you won't want to miss, there is also at least one off-the-wall sight in each show. In Prague, Samantha buys apple strudel the size and shape of giant burritos, in Amsterdam she buys a fat doobie in a coffee shop, in Brussels she tries raw herring and doesn't gag. In Seville, she visits a bar where the motif is kitschy Roman Catholic -- the bar looks like an altar and there are tacky Virgin Mary and Christ statuettes everywhere. The bartender, in his priest get-up, suggests the house cocktail special: Blood of Christ. Take that, Rick Steves.",5,"Touristy, Commercial, and Superficial.
