But I've watched it now several more times and it really holds up under repeated viewings.Dean Caine trades in his superhero spandex & cape for a helicopter playing the new head of security for a super secret underground lab.  Using powers of deduction which would make the Man of Steel kryptonite green with envy, Caine soon realizes he's guarding a lab full of genetic engineers attempting to revive & reconstruct those high flying, fire breathing creatures of legend - dragons.The cast is full of fun B movie type actors who infuse the required fun & fright factor into an equally solid script.  This isn't Dragonslayer, nor is it Dragonheart or even Reign of Fire - this is Sci-Fi Channel produced low budget fare, but it delivers a lot of bang for the buck.  The director goes a little overboard with his stylish split screen action at times, however it's never really annoying.So then let's see.  Terri Hatcher, former girlfriend of Superman Dean Caine is fighting female dragons over on Desperate Housewives and Dean Caine is fighting ""real"" lab produced dragons in this flick.  Looks like their careers are paralleling each other's nicely, wouldn't you say?",4,"In this corner!

The setting is appropriately claustrophobic and the sets are done quite well.  The CGI dragon looks passable, not great but believable enough I guess.  The characters are all pretty good - EXCEPT Dean Cain.  He's the security guard, and he's a pompous, self-righteous prick.  His knowledge of childhood fairy tales makes him more knowledgeable about dragons than all the scientists put together.  He single handedly makes this movie absolutely unwatchable.  That's too bad because without him, I think this might have been pretty good.  Well, if not for the fact that the idiot director has a fetish for that split screen effect where they show four different scenes running simultaneously in the four different quadrants of the screen.  Even that would have only been a one star deduction from what could have been a four star movie, but Dean ruins the whole thing.Recommendation:  Skip it.",1,Dean Cain completely ruins this movie,1153526400,"07 22, 2006",2006,1031,"['scientists', 'underground', 'lab', 'are', 'experimenting', 'DNA', 'create', 'dragon', 'loose', 'stalks', 'around', 'facility', 'setting', 'appropriately', 'claustrophobic', 'sets', 'are', 'done', 'quite', 'well', 'CGI', 'dragon', 'passable', 'not', 'great', 'believable', 'enough', 'guess', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'security', 'guard', 'pompous', 'self-righteous', 'prick', 'knowledge', 'childhood', 'fairy', 'tales', 'more', 'knowledgeable', 'dragons', 'scientists', 'put', 'together', 'single', 'handedly', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'unwatchable', 'too', 'bad', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'good', 'Well', 'not', 'fact', 'idiot', 'director', 'fetish', 'split', 'screen', 'effect', 'where', 'show', 'four', 'different', 'scenes', 'running', 'simultaneously', 'four', 'different', 'quadrants', 'screen', 'Even', 'would', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'one', 'star', 'deduction', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'four', 'star', 'movie', 'Dean', 'whole', 'thing.Recommendation', 'Skip']",Dragon Fighter

732410,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,B000083C60,Joshua Koppel,"[4, 5]","Sometime in the past of England, some brave nights set out to slay a dragon.  They were not very successful, but the dragon's flame set off their gunpowder and caused a cave-in that trapped the dragon.In present day, Dean Cain is the new head of security for an underground lab facility.  He arrives piloting a helicopter and bringing with him the lead scientist who is clutching a sample case.  Once at the facility, Dean learns that they are, indeed, performing cloning and that the scientist has a new sample.  He got it in England so you can guess what it is.An attempt is made at cloning the new sample, it develops much more rapidly than it should and it escapes into the facility.  The facility setting actually made it easier on the animators as all of the sets the creature was in looked the same and only allowed one posture.  A few plot twists put a time limit on when the survivors must get out of the facility and the tension builds.  The ending is typical but still fun with a few shades from other movies.The odd part of the movie is that the new Head of Security seems to have no security clearance and everyone outranks him.  He cannot open doors and much of the facility is off-limits to him.  There seems to be a complete lack of security systems (although there are some lab cameras that conveniently stop working when the plot demands).  This all makes the film lighter than was probably intended but does add to the entertainment value of the film.",3,Sometimes Extinction IS For The Better,1100736000,"11 18, 2004",2004,1470,"['Sometime', 'past', 'England', 'brave', 'nights', 'set', 'out', 'slay', 'dragon', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'successful', 'dragon', 'flame', 'set', 'off', 'gunpowder', 'caused', 'cave-in', 'trapped', 'dragon.In', 'present', 'day', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'new', 'head', 'security', 'underground', 'lab', 'facility', 'piloting', 'helicopter', 'bringing', 'lead', 'scientist', 'who', 'clutching', 'sample', 'case', 'Once', 'facility', 'Dean', 'are', 'indeed', 'performing', 'cloning', 'scientist', 'new', 'sample', 'got', 'England', 'can', 'guess', 'what', 'is.An', 'attempt', 'made', 'cloning', 'new', 'sample', 'much', 'more', 'rapidly', 'should', 'facility', 'facility', 'setting', 'actually', 'made', 'easier', 'animators', 'sets', 'creature', 'was', 'looked', 'same', 'only', 'allowed', 'one', 'posture', 'few', 'plot', 'twists', 'put', 'time', 'limit', 'when', 'survivors', 'must', 'get', 'facility', 'tension', 'ending', 'typical', 'still', 'few', 'shades', 'other', 'movies.The', 'odd', 'part', 'movie', 'new', 'Head', 'Security', 'have', 'security', 'clearance', 'everyone', 'can', 'not', 'open', 'doors', 'much', 'facility', 'off-limits', 'be', 'complete', 'lack', 'security', 'systems', 'are', 'lab', 'cameras', 'conveniently', 'stop', 'working', 'when', 'plot', 'demands', 'film', 'lighter', 'was', 'probably', 'intended', 'add', 'entertainment', 'value', 'film']",Dragon Fighter
732411,A2XVRCU5DQBULH,B000083C60,"L. Varnau ""nerff20""","[2, 3]","Hey, I understand this movie is DTV. I understand that there was little-to-no budget on this film. And I'm cool with it. But even acknowledging that, ""Dragon Fighter"" still isn't that great of a movie. Why? Because it's a rip-off of every isolated-area monster film since ""Anaconda."" A giant CGI creature is hunting down worthless characters one by one in a secluded spot that eventually blows up in the end. Dean Cain stars as Dean Cain in this film, proving once again that while he can always seem like a real nice guy, he's just not that good of an actor. The monster in this movie is a dragon, but it's a small dragon, about the size of a sports car. And it breathes very little ammounts of fire. I suppose it's a baby dragon, but it's not all that scary. And it looks very, very fake. UFO Films generally does a decent job with their CGI, and while this doesn't hit their rock-bottom worst (like ""Boa""), it does get low. Phillip Roth directed what could've been a little bit cool but instead is just a retread of every other B-monster movie in the past 10 years. I did like how it seemed to parody Michael Crichton in a few areas, but that's about as creative as it gets. The characters are very annoying (except the cook), the scenes are horrendously predictable, and the acting is very, very bad.
