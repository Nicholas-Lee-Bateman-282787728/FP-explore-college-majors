1175311,A3TMC106MIY8S5,B001C8W7EQ,A. Edward Azad,"[1, 1]","I am relieved to see Burn Notice hasn't suffered form a sophomore slump. Acting = spectacular. Plot = genre-defying. Guest stars = fantastic (particularly Tim Matheson and Michael Shanks as sociopathic nutballs) and once again, the season ends with a gratifying cliffhanger which instills both excitement and impatience for the next one. That said, there are a few irksome problems with the series.For one thing, while the main story arc is fascinating, a few characters meet abrupt (and icky) resolutions way before we've had time to get to know them. Hey, what gives?! Episodes often have a rushed feel to them. And there's a lot of rapid cross-cutting, as if the show can't juggle the main story and subplot within the time allotted.Secondly, I hope we get a break from the fractured family stuff. Michael's sleazy brother Nate is a welcome distraction, since he always brings with him buckets of trouble and is a capable sidekick. But what's happened to Madeline (Sharon Gless)? Where's the passive-aggressive blackmailing? The surly relationship with her offspring? Where's the ""edge""? Michael's mom is a big teddy bear now, and it's a weak point dramatically...especially since this family's various past traumas are soothed with frequent (and I mean FREQUENT) happy conclusions where everyone remembers to hug.I'm exaggerating a little, but the family bits are a nuisance and detract from the action. Hopefully, Michael's work will spill over into his family, which will shake things up somewhat. Right now, things are way too cozy.",5,"Not without flaws, but a great ride",1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,1539,"['am', 'relieved', 'see', 'Burn', 'Notice', ""n't"", 'suffered', 'form', 'sophomore', 'slump', 'Acting', '=', 'spectacular', 'Plot', '=', 'genre-defying', 'Guest', '=', 'fantastic', 'particularly', 'Tim', 'Matheson', 'Michael', 'Shanks', 'sociopathic', 'nutballs', 'once', 'again', 'season', 'gratifying', 'cliffhanger', 'excitement', 'impatience', 'next', 'one', 'said', 'are', 'few', 'irksome', 'problems', 'series.For', 'one', 'thing', 'main', 'story', 'arc', 'fascinating', 'few', 'characters', 'meet', 'abrupt', 'icky', 'resolutions', 'way', ""'ve"", 'had', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'Hey', 'what', 'Episodes', 'often', 'have', 'rushed', 'feel', 'lot', 'rapid', 'cross-cutting', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'juggle', 'main', 'story', 'subplot', 'time', 'allotted.Secondly', 'hope', 'get', 'break', 'fractured', 'family', 'stuff', 'Michael', 'sleazy', 'brother', 'Nate', 'welcome', 'distraction', 'always', 'buckets', 'trouble', 'capable', 'sidekick', 'what', 'happened', 'Madeline', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'Where', 'passive-aggressive', 'blackmailing', 'surly', 'relationship', 'offspring', 'Where', 'edge', 'Michael', 'mom', 'big', 'teddy', 'bear', 'now', 'weak', 'point', 'dramatically', 'especially', 'family', 'various', 'past', 'traumas', 'are', 'soothed', 'frequent', 'mean', 'FREQUENT', 'happy', 'conclusions', 'where', 'everyone', 'remembers', 'hug.I', ""'m"", 'exaggerating', 'little', 'family', 'bits', 'are', 'nuisance', 'detract', 'action', 'Hopefully', 'Michael', 'work', 'will', 'spill', 'over', 'family', 'will', 'shake', 'things', 'up', 'somewhat', 'Right', 'now', 'things', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'cozy']",Burn Notice: Season 2

I will admit that the concept sounded kind of stupid, but was urged by a friend to watch the 1st season that had come out on DVD.  I was instantly addicted and watched the entire 1st season in 1 day (only 9 episodes).  I couldn't wait for season 2 and it did not dissapoint.  Here is a tired idea that is made fresh and original with great writing, direction, and great performances from the cast.  Jeffrey Donavan, Gabrielle Anwar, and Bruce Campbell really are what make this show great.  I love the dry wit and interesting spy facts that are shared, all over a compelling storyline.  The main storyline behind the show (who burned Michael and why) is still a mystery after 2 seasons, but you don't get frustrated that the story is going no where.  The show focuses on what Michael is doing now, taking whatever jobs he can get for whatever pay they can afford, and that keeps the show going for the most part.

Let me explain, The three stars is the average for this release. Burn Notice gets 5 stars, 10 if I could give that high of a rating on Amazon, but the Blu-Ray gets 1 star.The show is very well written and full of action and suspense. I didn;t have cable so I had to watch season one on DVD and then had to wait for this to be released. Christmas came and I got a Blu-Ray player so I was extatic when Burn Notice came in Blu-Ray. To my disapointment I popped in the first disk and the picture looked like I was watching this through a window in a snow storm. It is terrible, and far below the standards of even DVD.I have contacted Fox to complain about the quality of this release and they are doing nothing but offering to swap my Blu-Ray. They will do nothing till more people complain. So I encourage you to Contact Fox and voice your distaste with this substandard release. There is a customer service 1-800# on their web site.

1175325,A3RU2P4FAACQ1J,B001C8W7EQ,"Elton Pinto ""Eptiger""","[7, 8]","Content-wise, this was an incredible season. I thought that it was a very good show in Season 1 that I would recommend to people with the caveat that it's not the best show on television, but it's a lot of fun to watch. With the second season, amidst the other shows on television this spring, it was clearly one of the top 5 shows on television, in my opinion. It went from just being a methodical, serialized spy show to really digging in deeper into the characters it revolves around and a more concrete driving plot towards the main character's main goal.It follows burned (fired) spy Michael Westen (Jeffrey Donovan) as he works for the people who burned him while trying to get his freedom back from them and figure out exactly who issued the burn notice and why. All the while, he's moonlighting in really fun situations. The writing got better this season, and the acting was as solid as ever from Jeffrey Donovan, Gabrielle Anwar (Fiona), and Bruce Campbell (Sam Axe). Donovan really shines, but everyone holds their own. To sweeten the pot, the season finale was one of the best season finales I've ever seen. I've never seen a season come to such a satisfying end while leaving me wanting more. For example, the last season of Lost left me wanting more, but I was pissed because it's sole purpose was almost to cheat me into watching next season by not wrapping barely anything up. Anyway, I highly recommend watching this show. Season 1 is a great season, don't get me wrong, but this season was like having your cake and eating it, too. It never ceases to amaze me how creative this show gets - it's not your standard formulaic cop show like every other cable television show out there, it really does make you think and you learn some pretty neat things.As far as the Blu-ray set: it's as unimpressive as Fox's television DVD sets normally are. There's commentary and deleted scenes on a handful of episodes, a blooper reel, and a short behind-the-scenes featurette. What I found very tacky, though it's a common practice nowadays, is that it starts out each disk with an advertisement for this very set as well as the upcoming season. This is a touch better than advertising other shows, but I feel like I should get back some of the money I paid for having to watch their advertising. By the way, the advertising is in sub-standard definition - it's terrible quality. The behind-the-scenes featurette and blooper reel were pretty neat, and some of the commentary was alright but I didn't listen to all of it. The deleted scenes were in pretty terrible quality, but they're just nice to have on there. The actual episodes had pretty decent sound quality and really spotty video quality.A lot of people have been bashing the video quality, but I think they're being HD brats (I'm usually an HD brat, myself). I'm sorry, but this isn't Lost or Heroes. The Burn Notice folks don't get big budgets to put on stunning visuals. I'll admit that it's overpriced as a Blu-ray to not have near-perfect colors and sharpness and such, but it's definitely not that bad. I felt that it was plenty sharp and some scenes had really beautiful colors. Several scenes tended to have a lot of grain - typically in the background though. The people usually looked pretty good, but sometimes a black background would be speckled with white. This wouldn't bother anyone except for people like me who walk to the television to look for imperfections like that for reviews like these or people who watch way too much high definition content. I'm used to watching Burn Notice in standard definition, so I can vouch for this being significantly better than that, and whether or not it's better than what you see on USA HD is debatable because I didn't see Season 2 in HD but Season 3 doesn't seem to look a whole lot better than what I see on my Blu-ray. It is, however, much prettier than Season 1 on DVD. The graininess thing is really not that bad though - there were plenty of scenes that really do look good. My TV is fairly top-of-the-line (Samsung Series 7 LCD), also, so maybe that's why I'm not seeing it as bad some others are. I do think it lives up to being a Blu-ray disc, just on the lower end. We have the same issue with DVDs: the best looking DVDs look a lot better than the terrible ones, and that's just how it is. You're going to have that with any high definition format, the point is that it's still a lot better thant he previous generation.Should you get this season? Absolutely. This show bears watching again and again. Should you get it on Blu-ray? That's a judgement call. I think the DVDs for Season 1 looked bad enough to spring for Blu-ray for Season 2 (especially with the excerpts of Miami scenery), but if you only want Blu-rays that look in line with Planet Earth then you should stick with the DVD.",5,A Great Show Became Exceptional!,1246233600,"06 29, 2009",2009,4822,"['Content-wise', 'was', 'incredible', 'season', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'show',

He's also a black belt and does other martial arts in real life so handles fight scenes well.

A spy Seinfeld, if you can picture that.His sidekicks add color to the show whether it's his explosives expert, part-time girlfriend, Fiona or his cheesy but remarkably competent friend Sam, they are a great team.

Yeah.  Michael is very patient.  When she's on stage I keep commenting to my sons they're lucky to have me as a mother instead of that.The plots and dialogue are original.  Only the bad guys seems to get hurt and they usually kill each other off which is always fun to watch.  Because the show is light and funny, the darker moments don't seem too grim.  Some of the episodes have you laughing out loud.There is one long story arc, and then several short story arcs in each episode which keeps it lively.  It's a fun series that keeps its momentum this season and gets even better.",5,Good Clean Violence,1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,1588,"['sons', 'hooked', 'show', 'watch', 'together', 'Love', 'main', 'character', 'Michael', 'burned', 'spy', 'who', 'different', 'characters', 'accents', 'situations', 'very', 'entertaining', 'rather', 'Eddy', 'Murphy', 'was', 'BEVERLY', 'HILLS', 'COP', 'when', 'would', 'adopt', 'different', 'identities', 'get', 'establishments', 'also', 'black', 'belt', 'other', 'martial', 'arts', 'real', 'life', 'handles', 'fight', 'scenes', 'well', 'When', 'eating', 'yogurt', 'shed', 'home', 'wry', 'deadpan', 'humor', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'A', 'spy', 'Seinfeld', 'can', 'picture', 'that.His', 'sidekicks', 'add', 'color', 'show', 'explosives', 'expert', 'part-time', 'girlfriend', 'Fiona', 'cheesy', 'remarkably', 'competent', 'friend', 'Sam', 'are', 'great', 'team', 'mother', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'bit', 'whiny', 'still', 'fun', 'most', 'other', 'mothers', 'look', 'good', 'constantly', 'smoking', 'drinking', 'not', 'doing', 'much', 'anything', 'else', 'scheduling', 'therapist', 'appointments', 'Michael', 'discuss', 'relationship', 'Yeah', 'Michael', 'very', 'patient', 'When', 'stage', 'keep', 'commenting', 'sons', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'have', 'mother', 'instead', 'that.The', 'plots', 'dialogue', 'are', 'original', 'Only', 'bad', 'guys', 'get', 'hurt', 'usually', 'kill', 'other', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'show', 'light', 'funny', 'darker', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'grim', 'episodes', 'have', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud.There', 'one', 'long', 'story', 'arc', 'then', 'several', 'short', 'story', 'arcs', 'episode', 'lively', 'fun', 'series', 'momentum', 'season', 'even', 'better']",Burn Notice: Season 2

Instead, finding out has made this former spy's life much more complicated.  Now that Carla (Tricia Helfer) has stepped out of the shadows as the organization's mouth piece, he has to do her bidding.  She has him on some assignment, and Michael thinks it isn't a good thing.  So he's trying to find out all he can about the organization and the big picture so he can try to stop them.But, meanwhile, he needs to eat, so he continues to take on assignments for people in desperate trouble.  There's the woman stalked by a drug dealer, the ex-con being roped back into a life of crime, the man who was lost his life savings to medical scam artists, and the football player being harassed by car thieves.  Heck, Michael even gets involved in tracking down a Haitian fugitive.Fortunately, Michael has the help he needs in the form of ex-FBI agent Sam Axe (Bruce Campbell) and ex-girlfriend Fiona Glenanne (Gabriella Anwar).  Then again, those two often bring him clients with simple problems that turn complicated.  Not making things any easier is Michael's mother Madeline (Sharon Gless) who insists on family bonding moments at the worst possible times.As much as I enjoyed season 1 of this show, I got even more hooked on season 2.  Everything was stronger.  The on going storyline is more than enough to keep anyone coming back from week to week.  Carla seems to be one step ahead of Michael the entire way, and I wanted to know what was going on as much as he did.  The weekly stories were just as strong.  I never saw how Michael and his friends would save the day.  And if you want tricky gadgets and plenty of explosions, this is the show for you.But the human element of the story actually becomes stronger, too.  They play up the relationship between Fiona and Michael even more this season, making both those characters more real.  I wasn't a fan of Madeline in the first season, but I warmed to her here.  I still wouldn't mind if she was only a recurring character, but I do feel she adds to the show now.As I write this, season 3 has just started, and they are building admirably on what came in this season.

1175349,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B001C8W7EQ,Mark Turner,"[3, 3]","When I wrote about season one of BURN NOTICE I couldn't praise it enough. Not only was it a well thought out action thriller for TV, it starred Bruce Campbell. How bad could it be? What can I say, I'm a fan.When season two began I found myself unable for one reason or another to continue to catch each episode on television. Thank goodness once more for the chance to watch a series uninterrupted via DVD box sets.The set up for the series is easy enough. Michael Weston (Jeffrey Donovan) is a covert agent who has just been given a burn notice. This means that his cover is withdrawn, bank account frozen, history deleted and he is out on his own. Unfortunately Michael was in the midst of a transaction with terrorists and must now escape them first.He does so and finds himself stranded in Miami, Florida. With no help, no money and no idea who issued the notice, Michael turns to his most trusted friends: an ex-girlfriend named Fiona (Gabrielle Anwar) who used to work as a bomber for the IRA and an old military friend named Sam (Bruce Campbell) who sold information on Michael to the FBI for money now and then.Michael's goal in season one was to find a way to make a living and at the same time discover who it was who issued his burn notice. In so doing, he hoped to get his old life back. Along the way, we got to see that he was a white knight of sorts who helped people who truly had no one else to turn to. Each episode offered a client with a description and a problem that needed solved Michael Weston style.At the end of season one, we started to get a glimpse along with Michael of who had burned him. A woman named Carla began calling and as the series finale ended, Michael Weston was in a car in a truck trailer on his way to meet the mysterious Carla.Season two continued Michael's search for the issuer of the burn notice. It turns out that Carla worked for a secret organization that took Michael offline from his own plans and now wants to put him to work for their organization. The name is unknown and the man in power behind Carla is as well. So the search continues.As do the jobs needed to make a living and to help people in need. Included in this group are a young teenage whose life is threatened by a gangster wannabe car thief, a Haitian thug wanted for murder by the father of a young woman he killed, a woman who works with a relief program whose medical supplies were stolen by pirates and even Michael's ex-fianc&eacute;, a woman no one in his small circle even knew existed.But season two offered more than the usual search and assist stories we came to enjoy. We got to know each character a little bit better. With Fiona we saw that even though the two had parted ways and tried to keep a professional distance, there was an intimacy and affection that ran deeper than they would care to admit. The love between the pair was there for all to see with the exception of the two participants.The same was true with the relationship between Michael and Sam, two die hard buddies who would throw their lives down for one another. Thank goodness this relationship didn't get as steamy as the one with Fiona!And we got to see Michael get a little bit closer to his mother as played by Sharon Gless. Past differences, past problems and more were always on the table with these two. And yet a respect and love for his mother was there even through the frustration he showed to her.By the end of this season, we are let in on just who is the man behind the whole burn notice. Maybe. But then again there could be someone behind him. As he tells Michael that he's not been trying to take him out but to protect him from the many enemies Michael has mad as a cover op, Michael chooses to go it alone. As season two ends, he apparently has been released, but now any and all enemies from his past can declare open season on him.Now it's just a matter of time. Time to sit and wait until season three finishes and comes out on disc as well.The series is fantastic. It offers tons of action, plenty of thrills, a great looking location (and cast) and enough humor to make a perfect blend. Donovan does a wonderful job as Weston showing acting chops I am certain no casting director has taken note of. Had they done so, he would be sought out more often. Anwar has gone from child star to vamp with ease, and offers the perfect touch of romantic at heart in her character of Fiona. And Bruce? Bruce does what he does best, being the sidekick while getting attention as well.There are tons of series available on DVD. Some you collect because you love the series and some you buy to see what the series is like. When you buy BURN NOTICE you'll end up purchasing for both reasons. And become the fan that I've become.",5,BURNING AGAIN,1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,4741,"['When', 'wrote', 'season', 'one', 'BURN', 'NOTICE', 'could', ""n't"", 'praise', 'enough', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'action', 'thriller', 'TV', 'starred', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'How', 'bad', 'could', 'be', 'What', 'can', 'say', ""'m"", 'fan.When', 'season', 'two', 'began', 'found', 'unable', 'one', 'reason', 'continue', 'catch', 'episode', 'television', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'once', 'more', 'chance', 'watch', 'series', 'uninterrupted', 'DVD', 'box', 'sets.The', 'set', 'up', 'series', 'easy', 'enough', 'Michael', 'Weston', 'Jeffrey', 'Donovan', 'covert', 'agent', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'given', 'burn', 'notice', 'cover', 'withdrawn', 'bank', 'account', 'frozen', 'history', 'deleted', 'out', 'own', 'Unfortunately', 'Michael', 'was', 'midst', 'transaction', 'terrorists', 'must', 'now', 'escape', 'first.He', 'so', 'stranded', 'Miami', 'Florida', 'help', 'money', 'idea', 'who', 'issued', 'notice', 'Michael', 'most', 'trusted', 'friends', 'ex-girlfriend', 'named', 'Fiona', 'Gabrielle', 'Anwar', 'who', 'used', 'work', 'bomber', 'IRA', 'old', 'military', 'friend', 'named', 'Sam', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'who', 'sold', 'information', 'Michael', 'FBI', 'money', 'now', 'goal', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'living', 'same', 'time', 'discover', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'issued', 'burn', 'notice', 'so', 'doing', 'hoped', 'get', 'old', 'life', 'back', 'way', 'got', 'see', 'was', 'white', 'knight', 'sorts', 'who', 'helped', 'people', 'who', 'truly', 'had', 'one', 'else', 'turn', 'episode', 'offered', 'client', 'description', 'problem', 'needed', 'solved', 'Michael', 'Weston', 'style.At', 'end', 'season', 'one', 'started', 'get', 'glimpse', 'Michael', 'who', 'had', 'burned', 'woman', 'named', 'Carla', 'began', 'calling', 'series', 'finale', 'ended', 'Michael', 'Weston', 'was', 'car', 'truck', 'trailer', 'way', 'meet', 'mysterious', 'Carla.Season', 'two', 'continued', 'Michael', 'search', 'issuer', 'burn', 'notice', 'out', 'Carla', 'worked', 'secret', 'organization', 'took', 'Michael', 'offline', 'own', 'plans', 'now', 'put', 'work', 'organization', 'name', 'unknown', 'man', 'power', 'Carla', 'as', 'well', 'search', 'continues.As', 'do', 'jobs', 'needed', 'make', 'living', 'help', 'people', 'need', 'Included', 'group', 'are', 'young', 'teenage', 'life', 'threatened', 'gangster', 'wannabe', 'car', 'thief', 'Haitian', 'thug', 'wanted', 'murder', 'father', 'young', 'woman', 'killed', 'woman', 'who', 'relief', 'program', 'medical', 'supplies', 'were', 'stolen', 'pirates', 'even', 'Michael', 'ex-fianc', 'eacute', 'woman', 'one', 'small', 'circle', 'even', 'knew', 'existed.But', 'season', 'two', 'offered', 'more', 'usual', 'search', 'assist', 'stories', 'came', 'enjoy', 'got', 'know', 'character', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'Fiona', 'saw', 'even', 'two', 'had', 'parted', 'ways', 'tried', 'keep', 'professional', 'distance', 'was', 'intimacy', 'affection', 'ran', 'deeper', 'would', 'care', 'admit', 'love', 'pair', 'was', 'see', 'exception', 'two', 'participants.The', 'same', 'was', 'true', 'relationship', 'Michael', 'Sam', 'two', 'die', 'hard', 'buddies', 'who', 'would', 'throw', 'lives', 'down', 'one', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'relationship', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'steamy', 'one', 'Fiona', 'got', 'see', 'Michael', 'get', 'little', 'bit', 'closer', 'mother', 'played', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'Past', 'differences', 'past', 'problems', 'more', 'were', 'always', 'table', 'two', 'yet', 'respect', 'love', 'mother', 'was', 'there', 'even', 'frustration', 'showed', 'her.By', 'end', 'season', 'are', 'let', 'just', 'who', 'man', 'whole', 'burn', 'notice', 'Maybe', 'then', 'again', 'could', 'be', 'someone', 'Michael', 'not', 'been', 'trying', 'take', 'out', 'protect', 'many', 'enemies', 'Michael', 'mad', 'cover', 'op', 'Michael', 'go', 'alone', 'season', 'two', 'ends', 'apparently', 'been', 'released', 'now', 'enemies', 'past', 'can', 'declare', 'open', 'season', 'him.Now', 'just', 'matter', 'time', 'Time', 'sit', 'wait', 'season', 'three', 'finishes', 'out', 'disc', 'well.The', 'series', 'fantastic', 'tons', 'action', 'plenty', 'thrills', 'great', 'looking', 'location', 'cast', 'enough', 'humor', 'make', 'perfect', 'blend', 'Donovan', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Weston', 'showing', 'acting', 'chops', 'am', 'certain', 'casting', 'director', 'taken', 'note', 'Had', 'done', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'sought', 'out', 'more', 'often', 'Anwar', 'gone', 'child', 'star', 'vamp', 'ease', 'perfect', 'touch', 'romantic', 'heart', 'character', 'Fiona', 'Bruce', 'Bruce', 'what', 'best', 'being', 'sidekick', 'getting', 'attention', 'well.There', 'are', 'tons', 'series', 'available', 'DVD', 'collect', 'love', 'series', 'buy', 'see', 'what', 'series', 'When', 'buy', 'BURN', 'NOTICE', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'purchasing', 'reasons', 'become', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'become']",Burn Notice: Season 2

1175356,A25BGV46BKHIX8,B001C8W7EQ,"Pamela R. Heath ""writer""","[91, 100]","The writing for the first season of Burn Notice was excellent, very tight with interesting characters and situations. However, towards the end, a lot of fans were worried. Some of the helpless clients of the week were starting to feel a touch repetitive.We needn't have worried.The second season just finished, and I can assure you that the writing is even better, the characters stronger, and many of the story lines more compelling, than in the first season. It's no wonder the show has doubled its viewing audience. I particularly like how the characters have evolved. Michael has dealt with some of his family issues, gotten closer to his brother, and understands that his mother really does care about him--even if that's easier to take when she's not blowing cigarette smoke (literally) in his face. The bad guys are organized and smart, which means he have to be even smarter. It's good story telling.However, even with all the other positives that made me pre-order the DVD set as soon as it was possible, there are several particular episodes that stand out from the rest, which alone are worth the price of the DVDs.  One of these involves Michael Westin trapped inside a bank during a robbery with a government agent, Bly, whom he blackmailed the first season and who hates Michael's guts. Watching  the respect build between the two, and the way they wind up working together -- not to mention Michael Westins way of dealing with the robbers -- is delightful. It's nothing you've ever seen before. It's not Die Hard and it's not like The Ransom of Red Chief (where a little boy makes kidnappers regret ever taking him to the point they wind up paying the parents to take him back). From start to finish, the robbers never figure out that they have a tiger by the tail. The only one with a clue how dangerous that Westin can be is Bly, who had read Westin's dossier in season 1 and has been dancing back and forth with him to see who can top whom. The ending is particularly satisfying. So, I really loved ""Bad Breaks"" and doubted (silly me) whether they could top this story line in the remaining episodes.They did.The season finale completed a fascinating story arc involving an ex-CIA agent, Victor, gone to the dark side. This 4 episode story arc alone makes this season is a must-have for fans. What can one say about this amazing character? Played by Michael Shanks in a recurring role, Victor took us through the gamut. We went from hating him and thinking he is a psychopath wavering on the edge of sanity (you were never quite sure how he was going to react to things), to realizing he was an incredibly tragic character and a cautionary tale of what Michael could have been in other circumstances. The emotional roller coaster we share with the characters on screen as we learn of Victor's back story (which comes out in the finale) and resulting changes in his relationship to Michael Westin is story telling at its best.I have not been a fan of Michael Shanks in the past. However, his acting here is truly inspired. It goes far beyond anything I've seen him do other than in ""The Arc of Truth"" in the prison scene when Shanks' character, Daniel Jackson, finally gives up hope. It is worthy of an Emmy. Moreover, even with the already great supporting cast of Bruce Campbell (always worth watching and allowed some great scenes in the 2nd season), Sharon Gless (as Michael's mother who smokes while exercising to Jack LaLanne--which you have to watch to realize how funny that is), and Gabrielle Anwar (as the explosive Fiona), there's something magical about the chemistry between Shanks and Donovan that seems to kick Donovan's acting--already extraordinary--up a notch to a level seldom seen on the small screen.  And if the ending is shocking, the choices made surprising to the viewer, one cannot help but feel that the characters have been changed forever by this experience and nothing will be quite the same again. Perhaps  best of all, it makes the viewer asks of season 3, what's next? Because if there's one thing the writers, actors, and producers have shown us, it's that they understand good story telling, and can be trusted to make choices that will keep us on the edge of our seats, coming back for more.I highly recommend this DVD set, especially if you haven't seen the show on TV. Although most of the story lines could work as stand-alones, there is an on-going story arc (of how and why Michael got burned and what he's doing to get his life back) that makes more sense if you watch them in order. The extras on the season 1 DVD set were excellent (including Donovan and Anwar's audition tapes), and I expect them to be equally good here. So far, I know of at least one extra that should be a lot of fun. Michael Shanks has reported recording a commentary track with Bruce Campbell and Matt Nix.I speak for many fans when I say I can hardly wait for June, and the start of season 3 on USA network! Thank goodness Donovan's contract has been extended for another 6 years (total 8 seasons)!

Season one saw Michael, Fiona, Sam and Madeline's characters get settled into their strides. The long term arc of the show was established to frame the trajectory of the characters. The pattern of the show is compelling with each show having a arc storyline moving the main burn notice theme forward and containing another storyline that is self-contained. Those self-contained stories are what drew me in when I discovered Burn Notice during the second season of broadcast.I am pleased with the Season 2 Blu-Ray set I purchased at Amazon. The case was sturdy and all the disks still in their mountings. The picture and sound seem superb on my Panasonic blu-ray. I feel like the player makes more difference than I would normally expect with this digital format. The set is technically fine by my viewing of the first blu-ray disk.As tv series sets go I am a little sad there aren't more ""features"". Just missing scenes from several episodes, a few commentary tracks, and a featurette I have not watched yet.  I would like to have seen outtakes, gag-reels, making-of mini-documentaries, interviews with the actors, producers, and directors, and additional background information.  The Stargate DVD sets did this sort of thing pretty well. These would add to my perceived value of the blu-ray season set vs streaming of the plain shows.Still, I love Burn Notice I can't knock the blu-ray set. It still gets 5 stars.

1175369,AZAC7B4HD5ZVC,B001C8W7EQ,Steven Herring,"[0, 0]","Burn Notice season 2 began right where the season 1 finale left off. Throughout the season you learn more about the people that burned Michael. The information came slowly throughout the year because Michael spends most of his time helping the helpless. There is always one civilian aid plot in every episode, and also a job for the people that burned MIchael. It's a 50/50 formula that works out quite well. I do wish that they would have given some more time to the overall mythos of the show and why he was burned, but then maybe it would have taken some of the formula out of the show. If it turned straight mythos like some other shows viewers might stop watching. There are alot of dramatic moments with Mike and Fiona throughout the year, and it was nice to see their relationship change because of MIchael's decision to leave at the end of the first season. My favorite episode of the season would have to be ""double booked."" It showed an interesting side of MIchael at the end. Michael's narration of espionage is still the best part of the show, along with Fiona's explosions. This season Michael is given a handler from the people that burned him and her character is filled in piece by piece. When the season ends you finally see the entire picture. I'm glad they did so because if they kept giving you only small tidbits of information every episode, people would start to get impatient. I think it has hurt season 3 somewhat, but something new will come along.The picture quality does not match the quality of the show though. There is an even thick amount of grain in about every shot. The only scenes that look good are the open shots of Miami, the rest look terrible. I don't blame the Blu Ray, because I've seen the season one dvd. This show is shot in 35mm film and is meant to have grain. It's how Matt Nix wants it to look. Just zone it out and focus on the show not the picture. There are a few commentary tracks, but it doesn't include Gabriel Anwar or Jeffrey Donovan. There are also deleted scenes and a trailer on every disc for the set itself which makes no sense. Not bad special features but they could have been better.This season is a great addition to your collection. The picture quality keeps it from getting the perfect score that it deserves. I hope there is another release that uses grain reduction to clean up the image. The show itself has alot of interesting plot developments and the dialogue is as witty as ever. Every episode brings you one step closer to the information you want to know.

I remember being impatient for Season 2 to starting airing.  When Season 2 was over I started being impatient about Season 3 starting & Season 2 coming out on DVD.  I was thrilled with Season 1's DVD.  I got Season 2's DVD at the beginning of April & we started watching it right away.  It was fantastic.  If you are a Burn Notice fan you will want this set of DVD's.  If you aren't a Burn Notice fan & are starting with this season I would recommend that you get Season 1 first because you'll miss a lot of the jokes.  They won't be in any context for you.Having someone else yanking Michael's chain became a great plot line & Karla was great for that.  The clients that Michael got were top notch stories & the underlying theme of trying to find out who burned Michael blended in real smoothly.  There were great guest stars this season with Michael Shanks being my favorite.  His character of Victor was fantastic.  He's a great stick for the carrot.  Sam & Fiona were great in their roles.  Fiona is a fantastic character right from the very beginning.  (I would love to meet & date a girl like her.)I think that anyone that enjoys good dramas that have good comedy in them will really enjoy Burn Notice.
