I expected them to say, ""Yes, we are a ruthless, souless, corporation driven simply by pure greed, our neverending mission being to open more and more stores around the globe while destroying all competition and increasing profits forever and ever until the return of Jesus. Amen"". You know what? I would at least respect that answer. It might actually work. But of coarse what they ended up doing was creating a public relations ""war room"" (-their term. Btw, ""public relations"" replaced the term ""propaganda"" to describe the exact same practices after the latter term became so tainted as to no longer be usable.)in late 2005 specificly to discredit this fair and objective -but passionate- critic of their business practices. On the same day as the release of THE HIGH COST OF LOW PRICE Wal-Mart released a DVD film defending its practices entitled WHY WAL-MART WORKS; AND WHY THAT DRIVES SOME PEOPLE C-R-A-Z-Y (""Crazy"" already written in all caps with hyphens). A very funny and highly ironic incedent latter occured with the director of the pro-Wal-Mart propaganda, Ron Galloway. Galloway publicly criticised Wal-Mart for it's disgusting labor practices stating, ""They just instituted a wage cap for long-term employees--people making between thirteen and eighteen dollars an hour. It's a form of accelerated attrition. They can't expect me to defend that."" Heh, well you just gotta love that one.This is an important film because Wal-Mart is the biggest public corporation by revenue in the entire world, the biggest private employer in the world, and the fourth biggest utility employer. They are also now the biggest grocery store in America and the biggest toy seller. They also run and own Sam's Club. So, it is only the right thing to do as a consumer AND a citizen to give a fair hearing to the critics and their arguments.How much scrutiny has the world's biggest corporation received by our major media institutions? We have heard much more from Wal-Mart in their ubiquitous TV advertisements and cheerful right-wing pundits on the wonderful benefits to America and the world of Wal-Mart's business model. With WAL-MART: THE HIGH COST OF LOW PRICE we get the other side of the story, and I'd argue a more accurate one.",4,dishes the dirt on Sprawl-Mart,1220140800,"08 31, 2008",2008,2351,"['Would', 'surprise', 'anyone', 'know', 'Wal-Mart', 'disputed', 'factual', 'accuracy', 'statements', 'made', 'film', 'LOL', 'expected', 'say', 'Yes', 'are', 'ruthless', 'souless', 'corporation', 'driven', 'simply', 'pure', 'greed', 'neverending', 'mission', 'being', 'open', 'more', 'more', 'stores', 'globe', 'destroying', 'competition', 'increasing', 'profits', 'forever', 'ever', 'return', 'Jesus', 'Amen', 'know', 'what', 'would', 'least', 'respect', 'answer', 'might', 'actually', 'work', 'coarse', 'what', 'ended', 'up', 'doing', 'was', 'creating', 'public', 'relations', 'war', 'room', '-their', 'term', 'Btw', 'public', 'relations', 'replaced', 'term', 'propaganda', 'describe', 'exact', 'same', 'practices', 'latter', 'term', 'became', 'so', 'tainted', 'longer', 'be', 'usable', 'late', '2005', 'specificly', 'discredit', 'fair', 'objective', '-but', 'passionate-', 'critic', 'business', 'practices', 'same', 'day', 'release', 'THE', 'HIGH', 'COST', 'OF', 'LOW', 'PRICE', 'Wal-Mart', 'released', 'DVD', 'film', 'defending', 'practices', 'entitled', 'WHY', 'WAL-MART', 'WORKS', 'WHY', 'THAT', 'SOME', 'PEOPLE', 'C-R-A-Z-Y', 'Crazy', 'already', 'written', 'caps', 'hyphens', 'very', 'funny', 'highly', 'ironic', 'incedent', 'latter', 'occured', 'director', 'pro-Wal-Mart', 'propaganda', 'Ron', 'Galloway', 'Galloway', 'publicly', 'criticised', 'Wal-Mart', 'disgusting', 'labor', 'practices', 'stating', 'just', 'instituted', 'wage', 'cap', 'long-term', 'employees', 'people', 'making', 'thirteen', 'eighteen', 'dollars', 'hour', 'form', 'accelerated', 'attrition', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'defend', 'Heh', 'well', 'just', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'one.This', 'important', 'film', 'Wal-Mart', 'biggest', 'public', 'corporation', 'revenue', 'entire', 'world', 'biggest', 'private', 'employer', 'world', 'fourth', 'biggest', 'utility', 'employer', 'are', 'also', 'now', 'biggest', 'grocery', 'store', 'America', 'biggest', 'toy', 'seller', 'also', 'run', 'own', 'Sam', 'Club', 'So', 'only', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'consumer', 'citizen', 'give', 'fair', 'hearing', 'critics', 'arguments.How', 'much', 'scrutiny', 'world', 'biggest', 'corporation', 'received', 'major', 'media', 'institutions', 'have', 'heard', 'much', 'more', 'Wal-Mart', 'ubiquitous', 'TV', 'advertisements', 'cheerful', 'right-wing', 'pundits', 'wonderful', 'benefits', 'America', 'world', 'Wal-Mart', 'business', 'model', 'WAL-MART', 'HIGH', 'COST', 'OF', 'LOW', 'PRICE', 'get', 'other', 'side', 'story', ""'d"", 'argue', 'more', 'accurate', 'one']",Walmart: The High Cost of Low Price

935413,A1LI2P529P9IRP,B000AYNG1G,Artistic Mind,"[8, 14]","Reality check: Getting rid of Walmart will not solve anything.Things will get much MUCH worse for quite a long time before they start to get better. Does anyone have the patience or the selflessness to make life harder on themselves and their loved ones? Are people willing to make their families starve or eat less for several years to bring back small businesses where they would have to pay a higher price for something that isn't worth paying more for? And how long will it take for jobs to come back? - to fill up the jobs lost by all the Walmarts that were shut down. How long will it take for most Americans to be employed again? How long will it take for things to get noticeably better?Too long.And it would be even harder if other businesses similar to Walmart were shut down. Home Depot maybe. Definitely McDonalds.It's always darkest before the dawn. Maybe everything will improve, but we're already in a recession/depression. Who is really willing to make a sacrifice on a bet? Will things truly get better? There's no promise of this.Places like Walmart allow families that can hardly pay for rent, much less clothes and food, to make some type of living. It allows them to keep their children from starving. It allows them to occasionally give their children a gift - something to brighten their otherwise dark childhood. For some people, it's a highER cost to stop going to Walmart.Side Note: What I hate about reviewers here is that people who give this movie 1 or 2 stars are accused of being ""paid by Walmart"" to write in a good word. That's not always the case. This movie was incredibly biased. Sure, the pros are scary to list because most people know them and it might be overly contradicting to their objective. But take any college English course that teaches argument and persuasion. You're supposed to present both sides of the argument. Typically those who don't do not have a found argument. Usually there are a lot of holes in their position that they're afraid of their audience discovering.I gave this movie 2 stars because ""I didn't like it.""  Why? I don't like people shoving a point down my throat. You know what I mean. Like when overly religious people shove their point down my throat and insist that I will burn in hell if I don't do what they say. Yep. This was a close equivalent - to me at least.And before anyone suggests it - I'm not a Walmart employee and I don't get any benefit from giving this movie a low rating.",2,My Opinion,1292198400,"12 13, 2010",2010,2461,"['Reality', 'check', 'Getting', 'rid', 'Walmart', 'will', 'not', 'solve', 'anything.Things', 'will', 'get', 'much', 'MUCH', 'worse', 'quite', 'long', 'time', 'start', 'get', 'better', 'Does', 'anyone', 'have', 'patience', 'selflessness', 'make', 'life', 'harder', 'loved', 'ones', 'Are', 'people', 'willing', 'make', 'families', 'starve', 'eat', 'less', 'several', 'years', 'bring', 'back', 'small', 'businesses', 'where', 'would', 'have', 'pay', 'higher', 'price', 'something', ""n't"", 'worth', 'paying', 'more', 'how', 'long', 'will', 'take', 'jobs', 'come', 'back', 'fill', 'up', 'jobs', 'lost', 'Walmarts', 'were', 'shut', 'down', 'How', 'long', 'will', 'take', 'most', 'Americans', 'be', 'employed', 'again', 'How', 'long', 'will', 'take', 'things', 'get', 'noticeably', 'better', 'Too', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'harder', 'other', 'businesses', 'similar', 'Walmart', 'were', 'shut', 'down', 'Home', 'Depot', 'maybe', 'Definitely', 'McDonalds.It', 'always', 'darkest', 'dawn', 'Maybe', 'everything', 'will', 'improve', ""'re"", 'already', 'recession/depression', 'Who', 'really', 'willing', 'make', 'sacrifice', 'bet', 'Will', 'things', 'truly', 'get', 'better', 'promise', 'this.Places', 'Walmart', 'allow', 'families', 'can', 'hardly', 'pay', 'rent', 'much', 'less', 'clothes', 'food', 'make', 'type', 'living', 'keep', 'children', 'starving', 'occasionally', 'give', 'children', 'gift', 'something', 'brighten', 'otherwise', 'dark', 'childhood', 'people', 'highER', 'cost', 'stop', 'going', 'Walmart.Side', 'Note', 'What', 'hate', 'reviewers', 'here', 'people', 'who', 'give', 'movie', '1', '2', 'stars', 'are', 'accused', 'being', 'paid', 'Walmart', 'write', 'good', 'word', 'not', 'always', 'case', 'movie', 'was', 'incredibly', 'biased', 'Sure', 'pros', 'are', 'scary', 'list', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'might', 'be', 'overly', 'contradicting', 'objective', 'take', 'college', 'English', 'course', 'argument', 'persuasion', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'present', 'sides', 'argument', 'Typically', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'not', 'have', 'found', 'argument', 'Usually', 'are', 'lot', 'holes', 'position', ""'re"", 'afraid', 'audience', 'discovering.I', 'gave', 'movie', '2', 'stars', 'did', ""n't"", 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'people', 'shoving', 'point', 'down', 'throat', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'overly', 'religious', 'people', 'shove', 'point', 'down', 'throat', 'insist', 'will', 'burn', 'hell', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'what', 'say', 'Yep', 'was', 'close', 'equivalent', 'least.And', 'anyone', ""'m"", 'not', 'Walmart', 'employee', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'benefit', 'giving', 'movie', 'low', 'rating']",Walmart: The High Cost of Low Price
935414,A3ATTCCO32ZXET,B000AYNG1G,"A. Ryan ""Merribelle""","[11, 13]","I will admit to having shopped at Wal-Mart in the past.  Like most people, the thought of saving one or two bucks on a pair of jeans or the kids' birthday presents was too tempting for me to pass up even though I'd heard rumors of the company's terrible treatment of its employees.  The fact is, it just didn't seem real to me until I was confronted with the stories of actual people who'd worked for Wal-Mart - and some who still were employed there.It was obvious before I even rented this DVD that it was going to be a piece of propaganda against Wal-Mart. The giant meanie-face character smashing through a peaceful suburb on the front cover made that pretty clear from the get go.  I assumed that there were some companies with real axes to grind against Wal-Mart, competing retail chains that have been hurt by the heavy competition.  It was not such a stretch to imagine such companies backing a film like this in an effort to damage their competitor's profits.  How much credibility should one grant the claims and conclusions of such a film?It's true that Wal-Mart: the High Cost of Low Price does make liberal use of emotional manipulation via interviewing many poor, put-upon employees of WM; stories unfold of wages so low that they cannot afford the company's health care program.  They must at times choose between paying for prescriptions and eating. Many full-time WM employees have to turn to public assistance programs like Medicaid.  Others talk about the stress of being constantly spied upon though store cameras and managers to ensure that they do not conspire to unionize (suspicion of which is enough for management to find an excuse to fire).  Former managers reveal how they were told to profile employees based on how they socialized with others and body language, to determine if they were talking union.  They also admitted to understaffing on purpose to cut costs, even though it caused the workers there to finish the job with unpaid overtime.  This all painted a condemning picture of a company that just doesn't care about the welfare of its people.But underneath these sad anecdotes, the case against the retail giant made by this film is backed by several logical arguments.  First, that the many WM employees who are forced to use government programs like Medicaid are increasing costs to us, the taxpayers.  Second, the unattractive detail that WM buys primarily from China instead of American-made goods.  Nice, Wal-Mart!  Fits with your ""all-American"" image.  And finally, when the last segment of the film revealed the appalling lack of parking lot security - which accounts for WM nationwide being the sites of more crimes like robberies, rapes and murders than any other store - well, I don't like to shop at a store that cares so little for me, the customer.  A selfish motivation on my part of course, but it was the last straw that got to me. Do I trade my safety for low prices? I decided that I didn't need that cheap pair of sweatshop jeans so badly after all.I realize that there well may be another side to this story that I haven't heard, but until WM does something to A) provide affordable health care for its employees, B), Starts buying American, and C) shows visibly reduced parking lot crime due to increased security, I will be disinclined to hear that other side.  The richest retail family in the country could afford to crack open their wallets a bit more.As a documentary, Wal-Mart; the High Cost of Low Price did an adequate job of presenting its case.

935417,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B000AYNG1G,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","Before you ever set foot in a Wal-Mart store again, see this movie. Sure, you've heard they are greedy capitalists, and not very good to their employees. But I'm betting you didn't know just how bad they are in how many ways if you haven't seen this film.The most heartbreaking part for me was the look into the Wal-Mart suppliers all around the world. Like China, where employees work incredibly long hours for incredibly low pay, under terrible conditions. When the Wal-Mart ""inspectors"" come to review the working conditions, they send word in advance so that the managers can brief people in what to say (or more significantly, what not to say), and they can clean up the place and let the inspectors take home a satisfactory report.The film points out that Wal-Mart gets huge government subsidies in a variety of ways. One way is to direct their employees to government services such as medicaid and WIC for which they are eligible because their income is so low. Their techniques for quashing any attempt at union organizing are detailed. Irony abounds: in a segment on safety in the parking lot, one store where a woman was abducted had the abduction on film, even though there was no one watching the security cameras. They had been installed to record union organizing activity in the parking lot so as to identify and eliminate employees who talked to union organizers.You'd think the number of lawsuits against the company might tell them something, but apparently it is more cost-effective to pay off when necessary rather than to correct their practices.The good news is that the film ends on a positive note, showing how many communities have managed to keep Wal-Mart out of their area.

935429,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000AYNG1G,Ed Uyeshima,"[11, 13]","Filmmaker Robert Greenwald has effectively made mincemeat of his targets in a couple of recent fiery documentaries - Rupert Murdoch and the FOX Network in ""Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism"", and the Bush administration in ""Uncovered: The War on Iraq"". His latest is no exception as he lays into Wal-Mart, its CEO Lee Scott and Sam Walton's heirs in this probing 2005 critique of corporate injustice. Instead of providing a single narrative voice, Greenwald structures his film as a series of vignettes focusing on discrete instances of where Wal-Mart has violated fair market practices, passed over women and minorities for leadership positions, restricted movements toward employee unionization, taken advantage of cheap labor in China and India, and disregarded environmental standards.The grievances seem endless, and the film even discloses the embarrassingly paltry amounts each Walton family member has given to charitable causes (compared to Bill Gates, of course). The most touching episodes focus on victims like Red Esry, who are experiencing the closure of their multi-generational small businesses in small towns where Wal-Mart opens and cannibalizes the competition. Much of the treatment seems ham-fisted, especially in the juxtaposition of Wal-Mart commercials and in-house training videos within the context of those being crushed by the corporation's economic clout. Moreover, the one segment about the rape of an employee in a parking lot, while horrific, seems more generic in nature than Wal-Mart's accountability in the incident. The abundance of conjecture and the lack of attributable facts tend to affect some of the film's credibility.However, Greenwald makes his points with clarity. Especially effective is the use of archived footage of Scott asserting to a massive audience of his employees that Wal-Mart has done nothing but good for the economy, even though many of them have to go on welfare to get medical care. The film ends with a montage of people who have successfully lobbied against the construction of stores in their towns. At the same time, Greenwald has not made a monomaniacal diatribe, as the takeaway never feels like the destruction of Wal-Mart but more a call for a severe overhaul of their internal practices. The filmmaker has certainly come a long way since his 1980 feature film debut, the ludicrous ""Xanadu"", and he seems to be continuing his streak of confronting those corrupted by their power.The DVD has several extras, the best being a twenty-minute making-of featurette and a separate 16-minute short, ""The Big Meeting"", on how the film came about. Greenwald also provides a commentary track, though much of what he shares can be gleaned from the featurettes.

935430,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,B000AYNG1G,Edwin C. Pauzer,"[85, 95]","Right from the start, you get the impression of  a family's impending doom. They have run a successful business for a generation and have been members of their community for several more. The juggernaut Walmart is about to move into the area. The viewer wonders, but knows what will befall the family business.As the producer points out, this has occurred all over America where Walmart has set up shop, demanded more services from the county treasury, and ran local stores into bankruptcy, destroying main streets everywhere. If the Wallmart is not profitable, it will be shut down. It will leave a vacant building and parking lot and a shuttered main street like the parasite that has sucked the life out of its host.Robert Greenwald also focuses on the Walmart employees who are forced to work long hours sans overtime, health care, or union protection. On this last one, in particular, Walmart fights tooth and nail with a rapid response force of lawyers that will descend on the wayward employees the same day the news reaching them. (When Walmart butchers successfully unionized in Wisconsin, the company closed down the butcher shops in those stores.)Many employees are paid so poorly that they cannot afford the cost of health coverage the company provides. They get public assistance and must apply for food stamps. Ironically, Wallmart touts their wonderful health plan that would cost many of their employess almost half their salary.The odd part of this documentary was seeing Walmart's CEO addressing a crowd of enthusiastic Wallmart employees extolling Walmart's exemplary employee treatment. It had more of the look of an Amway convention where individual achievement is encouraged. And that is about all that Walmart is willing to offer them. Their contributions to employees and charities is such a shamefully low amount, you come away with the feeling that the Walmart family heirs still own their first dime.When confronted with a Walmart-resistant community, they may resort to underhanded telephone surveys or barraging opponent's phone lines. For this they will spare no expense.If Greenwald's purpose was to steer me away from Walmart, he succeeded. I have no wish to profit from someone else's misery.

But for Greenwald supporters to claim that the ""other"" Wal-Mart film, ""WHY WAL-MART WORKS"" was funded by Wal-Mart (or even ""supported"" in any way), is such an obvious lie that it pales the credibility of any other statements made by Greenwald or his mob. I've seen both films, but I doubt that anyone else reporting on either of these Amazon.com feedback boards has.  The Greenwald film is well made, despite it's many factual errors, drawn largely from Greenwald's admission (on CNN's Showbiz Tonight) that he deliberately excluded anything positive about Wal-Mart in order to manipulate gullible viewers into supporting his special interest agenda.  I don't think that is the strategy of most true ""documentary"" producers, especially someone like Greenwald who famously attached Fox News for purportedly not being ""fair and balanced.""  So when Greenwald's distribution team compares the other film, ""WHY WAL-MART WORKS"" to "" Nazi propaganda film"" I find the comparison to be shockingly inappropriate and insulting.  The use human atrocities for financial gain is a deplorable act of desperate greed.  It's horribly disrespectful to the millions of people who lost their lives in the Holocaust. Honestly, Greenwald, tell your distribution mob to chill-out and remember that we're not talking about a war or killing people, we're talking about a retail store. Anyone who doesn't like Wal-Mart (or Target, or K-Mart or Costco or even Neiman Marcus) is not required to shop at those stores. By the same token, not a single one of the 1.3+million Wal-Mart employees is being held against their will as forced laborers. If you want to criticize the Galloway's film, watch it first, then comment. It has flaws, and suffers from its tight, independent budget. No, they did not have the funding support of Wal-Mart (or any ""special interest groups"" either). They made a movie about a company that has become a cultural phenomenon and part of the lives of 138-million shoppers every week. Not every cultural phenomenon is to everyone's tastes, either. It's a tribute to our society that people have the right to have their own tastes and preferences. Some people like to wear leisure suits and pay extra for goods that could be obtained less expensively. Some people like to criticize others rather than risk failure with their own efforts. But these are all rights that we have in America... the right to shop where you want, the right to pay more if you want to, the right to produce films that put forward false statements as if they were true (as in Greenwald's WAL-MART: The High Cost Of Low Price).

Wal-Mart single-handedly put my 2 uncles out of the cattle business in Michigan. (Raising, not butchering).This movie resonates with me, I assure you. The tone of the movie was alarmist and overly dramatic. The movie quotes statistics, but leaves them without any scale. They say something like Wal Mart policies put 4500 children on public assistance in Texas...how many are on public assistance? If the number is 5000, then Wal-Mart's contribution is shocking. If its 500,000, its less shocking...almost irrelevant.I have never bought into the idea that Wal Mart is doing nothing differently than other companies are doing. Its a problem of ethics. If every company employed slave labor, would it be then OK for Wal-Mart to do so? Not necessarily. Just because abuse is rampant doesn't mean its OK to allow it to continue or to participate in it.Some of the points from the movie I felt to resonate with me, Wal-Mart is not helping America, its laying waste to businesses with Chinese made products and reshaping rural America in the pattern of India or some other third world rural areas (watch carefully, they are painting this picture in the background). Wal-Mart is a burden to the tax-payers...we aren't really getting cheaper products...we are getting products that seem cheaper, but they are made up for by higher taxes or less government services.If there is a problem with the United States and our job-base...we need more companies to hire more Americans at rates substantially above minimum wage. People need health-care and to be able to make enough money to provide for themselves and their families. Wal-Mart may not be the problem or the only one causing the problem, but it isn't part of the solution.There is some very solid material in there. Its worth a watch.

It doesn't pull any punches in is presentations of different stories in how Wal-Mart affects people's lives from employees (both past and present) to owners of small businesses to oversea factory workers to local governments. It shows in these stories that it doesn't matter whether you work for Wally World or not or whether you shop on a daily basis there or avoid Wal-Mart like it is the plague, due to its business practices Wal-Mart invades everyone's life in some way.This is not an unbias look at Wal-Mart but neither is this a smear campaign either. It is simply tells the story how Wal-Mart through its business dealing and practices has become one of the largest companies today. Wal-Mart is known for its ads saying they have everyday low prices. What this documentary shows is the price everyone else pays for having Wal-Mart in their neighborhood and communities. One of the most interesting stories told is the first one in the film. It looks at a small neighborhood hardware store in a small town in Ohio that had been in business for 40+years. That is until Wal-Mart announced it was going to build a supercenter in that town. Unable to compete against a giant like Wal-Mart what you watch is the death of a small business and a dream.The segment looking at how Wal-Mart treats its associates is for me interesting since I work for this company. What makes this I think a fair assessment of working conditions there is that they not only interview past employees but current ones as well. Their stories are similar and the frustrations they to through dealing with managers who want the already overworked associates to do even more work and for little pay. It outrages me to watch the part where Wal-Mart managers encourage their workers to go on food stamps and Medicare which in the end becomes a financial strain on society.There are other issues about Wal-Mart's business practices that is covered in this film. Instead of giving a brief rundown on those stories just go out and get this compelling documentary. Whatever your feelings may be towards Wal-Mart this film is important to see.

Sure the number of better paying jobs in the towns dropped for a small number of people, but the prices for goods and services plummeted once the monopoly these buisness owners once enjoyed were broken.Get a basic education in math and economics and you'll understand that this video, and many like it, is nothing more than emotional pro-socialist, pro-labor drivel.",1,Not very informative too biased,1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,2041,"['video', 'documentary', 'Eviliness', 'Wal-mart', 'reality', 'indepth', 'look', 'level', 'arrogance', 'entitlement', 'self-serving', 'outrage', 'former', 'monopoly', 'business', 'owners', 'small', 'communities', 'unskilled', 'minimum', 'wage', 'employees', 'Look', 'further', 'want', 'see', 'why', 'work', 'ethic', 'social', 'fabric', 'America', 'breaking', 'down', 'national', 'scale', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'insurance', 'too', 'expensive', 'Single', 'mom', '2x', 'kids', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'have', '75', 'dollars', 'coming', 'paycheck', 'Single', 'mom', '2x', 'kids', 'Everything', 'paycheck', 'right', 'back', 'Wal-Mart', 'Single', 'mom', '2x', 'kids', 'have', '18', 'month', 'old', 'baby', 'have', 'pay', 'everything', 'Single', 'teenage', 'mom', '1x', 'kidWake', 'up', 'call', 'are', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'able', 'afford', 'support', 'family', 'minimum', 'wage', 'job', 'doubly', 'so', 'single', 'parent', 'household', 'Minimum', 'wage', 'starting', 'point', 'not', 'destination', 'career', 'want', 'fair', 'share', 'profits', 'Buy', 'stock', 'most', 'companies', 'Wal-mart', 'actually', 'out', 'decent', 'quartly', 'dividen', 'employee', 'can', 'buy', 'fractional', 'stock', 'shares', 'company', 'fees', 'Fractional', 'stock', 'purchases', 'let', 'buy', 'less', 'single', 'share', 'amounts', 'allowing', 'very', 'small', 'purchases', 'making', 'very', 'affordable', 'Then', 'too', 'can', 'be', 'evil', 'stock', 'share', 'holder', 'taking', 'advantage', 'poor', 'workers', 'Demanding', 'more', 'pay', 'nothing', 'theft', 'pure', 'simple.As', 'far', 'little', 'towns', 'do', 'honestly', 'think', 'little', 'Mom', 'Pop', 'where', 'paying', 'more', 'minimum', 'wage', 'providing', 'lavish', 'health', 'benefit', 'packages', 'employees', 'were', 'not', 'top', 'were', 'charging', 'more', 'services', 'too', 'Sure', 'number', 'better', 'paying', 'jobs', 'towns', 'dropped', 'small', 'number', 'people', 'prices', 'goods', 'services', 'plummeted', 'once', 'monopoly', 'buisness', 'owners', 'once', 'enjoyed', 'were', 'broken.Get', 'basic', 'education', 'math', 'economics', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'video', 'many', 'nothing', 'more', 'emotional', 'pro-socialist', 'pro-labor', 'drivel']",Walmart: The High Cost of Low Price

Just for a reality-check, I took a Wal-mart employee. Hey, I've always wanted to ask the people who actually work there, and now I had a legitimate reason.Oh, please. The movie made its case very badly, taking individual incidents and making them out to be company-wide problems. And really, playing some sort of Darth Vader music when Wal-mart execs came on-screen! It was so low-rent, picking hot buttons and fanning emotion. The employee was totally bewildered--she said that she could only speak for the one store she worked in, but she'd never seen any of those problems at all; she had health insurance; she'd never been discriminated against; they never had left chemicals out in the parking lot.And personally, I'm wondering whether some of these people with romantic memories of mom and pop stores are delusional. I'm sure there were some that were fabulous, but personally I grew up in a small town where we were unmercifully ripped off by local stores. They never had a choice of product and they charged what they wanted. That's why Wal-mart got its start in rural communities, and that's why it's still most succesful there.Slave labor? For another assignment I interviewed a man who inspects ""sweat shops"". Yes, he actually goes there. His informed opinion was that although there are still a very few bad places, the overwhelming majority are becoming pretty reasonable and many are downright decent places to work, and way better than the alternative. Surprised the heck out of me, frankly. Not the story I was gleefully anticipating.We want developing nations to have the same standard of living we worked up to over many years of industrialization. A noble thought, but...Never mind, it's good to keep pressure on companies to expect standards overseas, but let's not go overboard and believe only by the horror stories.And I'm always curious as to why people think mom-and-pop stores are fine not paying health insurance and employing part-timers, but it's not OK if Wal-Mart does it. Let's get real here--we need a national system. We pay 16% of our GDP for health costs; other industrialized nations pay around 10% and have care for eveyone--and longer lifespans. The producers of this excrable film would done better to have investigated that. Or maybe not, if they're going to make a pig's breakfast of things.I'm generally considered to be a bleeding-heart liberal. But I do try hard not to simply swallow badly-researched smear stories wholesale.

""The adherents of Gingrich, Delay, Limbaugh, and Bush and company must be sent packing, so that the Wal-mart phenomenon can be addressed politically. An interesting aspect of the film is the completely different approach taken in Europe towards workers by Wal-mart. There six week vacations and adequate pay are standard. That is because the social democracies of Europe have legal standards for corporations. And Wal-mart is not losing money in Europe. America needs to get the political willpower to curtail Wal-mart's excesses.""Since when are the above Republicans adherents of laissez-faire capitalism.  If anything, both Democrats and Republicans are socialists believing that government should plan society.  The only real adherents of laissez-faire are the libertarians, and even many of them not sometimes.  Learn some Economics will you.  It's not Wal-Mart that's killing small-town America, it's government regulations which were created by you Socialists who have ruined Europe and turned it into a poeverty center.  Also, the director engages in the Socialist practice of defining poverty by income rather than material conditions.

935443,AATS9Q7VJ4PFI,B000AYNG1G,Kevin R. Austra,"[5, 9]","I heard a lot about this documentary and finally set aside time to view it.  From the title alone you know that the film is going to be a Wal-Mart bashing story from beginning to end.  With documentaries and television news features like this I normally begin with a bias favoring the defendent -- in this case, Wal-Mart.  I expected to hear the usual digruntled rantings of lazy terminated employees and other crazies who thrive on complaints against their ""oppressive"" employers.After watching the film I decided that my preconceived notion was incorrect.  Though there may be some professional conspiracy theorists interviewed in the movie, there are such a variety of current (as of 2005) and prior employees, both management and associates, involved in this project that there must be validity to their complaints.The one thing that bothers me about the film is that it lacks balance.  We never get Wal-Mart's side of the issue except for pirated clips from corporate videos and short interview snippets that were lensed by someone else.  These clips are always presented with commentary, captions, or ominous music that automatically characterize them as Wal-Mart propaganda.  Surely there must be at least one current or former Wal-Mart manager or associate willing to stand in front of the store in the parking lot to say something good about the organization.There are a lot of givens with Wal-Mart.  One of the movie portrayals is that Wal-Marts have destroyed old fashioned downtown businesses.  Face it, most downtown businesses with their limited floor space and modest hours deserved to go the way of the dinosaurs.  I remember years ago living in a small Georgia town where the Main Street businesses, complete with shoddy Mayberry awnings, already looked as if they were half abandoned.  Those still operating opened but a few brief hours and did not accept credit cards or personal checks.  These were the types of stores where you often found yourself waiting, sometimes in vain, for assistance at the register because the clerk thought it more important to finish telling his epic hospital stay or fishing story to some other flannel shirted crony.  In the case of this particular Georgia town, when it was announced that Wal-Mart was moving in there were the usual complaints about a mega store dooming Main Street businesses.  How can you doom something that is already terminal?  Those Main Street businesses that could modernized their images, rebuilt their store fronts, set up tables on potted flora on the sidewalk, and did other things to attract customers to an environment they cannot find at a mall or department store.  Others simply played the ""woe-is-me end of the family owned business"" card and shut down.The documentary tables a lot of issues about Wal-Mart.  The most shocking is the way its employees are treated and compensated.  Low wages, unpaid overtime, threats, and at-will terminations without reason if the person is deemed a union instigator.  One premise set forth by the movie is that Wal-Mart installed security cameras not so much for controling store pilferage, but to ensure that employees are watched and dissuaded from any lawful assembly.  This is hardly late breaking news.  Wal-Mart is not alone in the way it treats its employees.  I worked for years in a large grocery store chain where managers doctored time cards (when we actually used time cards) to work underage employees well past their legal evening curfew, deferred overtime hours to subsequent days so as to avoid overtime, and greatly reduced the hours of tenured employees while at the same time provided additional work days to new hires with much lower hourly pay rates.  As such I heartily disagree with the way Wal-Mart treats its employees.  On the other hand the Wal-Mart penny-pinching workhouse philosophy is not new to the industry.Way back in the early 1980s I never heard of Wal-Mart. Living in the Northeast and later in the Southwest there were either no or very few Wal-Marts in those areas.  It was not until we moved to Georgia that I was exposed to the Wal-Mart phenonemon.  Remember too that Wal-Mart creator Sam Walton still held the reins to this up and coming giant.  The stores at the time were almost identical.  They were clean and I do not think I ever had an interaction with an employee that was ever unpleasant.  In fact, those were the days where it was not uncommon for a store manager to randomly ask you if found everything you were looking for.  Wal-Mart was also very big on selling American made products over foreign manufacture whenever a US product was available.Of course that was before the sudden growth surge of Wal-Marts across country and in Europe.Wal-Mart is traditionally non-union.  The documentary spends a lot of time on Wal-Mart's battle to keep unions out.  According to the film Wal-Mart has a multi-million dollar response team that flies out on a moment's notice whenever there is a hint of union activity.  Here too it must be pointed out that Wal-Mart is hardly the only large chain store that is not unionized.  However in Wal-Mart's case maybe it should be if for no other reason but to ensure that employees are offered affordable dental, health, and prescription plans.  Many of the employees interviewed in the film discuss the high cost of Wal-Mart's health care.  More disturbing are the allegations that Wal-Mart employees are reportedly encouraged and coached to apply for state and Federal aid programs.  If true the bottom line is that our tax dollars pay the health ""benefits"" for Wal-Mart employees.While watching the film I thought about the amount of times I shop at the retail giant.  Even though I initially walked away from the movie with a firm resolve to never frequent Wal-Mart again, I found myself driving there the following day for lawn care and back to school items.  The other similarly distanced retailers did not have what I needed and were already setting up Christmas displays -- and it is still summer.  Despite the telling evidence of the movie I have yet to find a more convenient store to pick up all the things I need at once.The bottom line is that after watching this documentary you have to draw your own conclusions as to the absolutes:  What allegations are true, which are exaggerated, and whether any or all of the evils tabled about Wal-Mart are significantly different from those perpetrated by other retail giants.",4,"A Shocking Documentary, But I Still Shop There",1188604800,"09 1, 2007",2007,6439,"['heard', 'lot', 'documentary', 'finally', 'set', 'aside', 'time', 'view',

But they dont tell you that in this documentary....They also dont tell you that Walmart is the largest employer of American workers in this country.The screwed up economic balance of the working class, is a large reason why Walmart has to buy products from foreign markets.  American manufacturers are to high priced.  The only people who can afford to buy American made goods are Union wage employees.  They earn considerably more than their non union counterparts, for soing the same exat job....and they get much better benefits to boot.This documentary is nothing more than sourgrapes inspired by Walmarts competitors.  It is a tool desined to brainwash people against Walmart, so the greedy American Walmart copetition can extinguish Walmart in order to gain control of the market.Walmart employees earn the same rate of pay as the other stores doing the same type of business (ie.  Kmart, Target, Costco, Meijer).  While I agree that Walmart emloyees are underpaid.....soare all the other employees in that type of industry...to include food stores and any retail sales business.  Walmart is the largest chain inthe world, no wonder they are the target of their vast competition.  What we need is the gov't to regulate wages for ALL employees...and start monitoring the wages of our countries politicians, CEO's and high profile figures.Wake up America.......if you are part of the vast majority NOT earning union wages....You need Walmart to keep your head above water.

For the record, I despise WalMart and I think it should burn - but only after they have rebuilt the distributor/retailer framework so all of the smaller stores can pick up the supply/demand slack without any transitional pains.  There are many good points made in this movie, but an equal (or greater) number of eyebrow raisers.When they're showing how poor and destitute all of the businesses have become in the first town, why is there a lingering shot of a hotel?  Is WalMart stealing from the Holiday Inns and HoJos too?!?The sound mixing is exceptionally poor, all WalMart commercials are playing at 120% volume, while some interviews are playing at %60 volume.  At one point there is schmaltzy sentimental music playing, along with a voiceover by the interviewed subject, both playing over a shot of the interviewed subject talking on the phone - all three audio sources are potted up to max, trying to drown each other out.The ""spinning headline smashing into the TV screen"" effect helped this film in the impact department a lot, I used to get the same sense of excitement and urgency from Super Friends every Saturday morning.  These days I can only get it from tabloids, so it's refreshing to see this style of presentation make a comeback.  Many of the statistics are showed briefly, and never cite any research performed or methods used.  Seriously, how did they get hard numbers for WalMart's 'super-secret' union busting equipment and procedures (one of the most fascinating points of the movie, but not explored to any extent)?Yes, people get mugged in parking lots.  Yes, I believe that the WalMarts brought into question have a responsibility to maintain a certain level of safety on their premises.  But this movie makes it sound like WalMart is responsible for fostering the crime itself.  These are problems that begin outside of WalMart's parking lots, and fingers should be pointed in other places (median income, environment, law enforcement, etc) for the most part.Greenwald has reached beyond his abilities here in my opinion, there are times when you get the feeling that he is reaching (as with the parking lot crimes).  The ending ""Victory"" montage was an amusing attempt at group hugging - victory over what?  I still drive past two Walmarts in my 45 minute commute and I don't see any of them closing.

Wal-Mart is portrayed as a great destroyer of human lives.  Some examples:- Women are systemically excluded from management roles - and told so to their faces.  Employees receive and report racist slurs, that managers ignore.- Palletized bags of fertilizer are stored on parking lot grounds where the rain carries the chemicals into local drinking water.  Complaints to Wal*Mart headquarters are ignored until the practices are reported on the evening news.- Managers illegally alter worker hours to erase overtime pay.- Managers coerce unpaid overtime from employees by inferring they'll be fired and if they don't go along.- Union buster hit squads are deployed from Wal*Mart headquarters by corporate jet at the first hint of unionization activity.  Suspected leaders are followed through the store to observe who they associate with.- Managers distribute information on Medicaid and food stamp programs to employees because benefits are below subsistence.  (Our tax dollars subsidizing Wal*Mart.)- Municipalities grant Wal*Mart tax abatements and building subsidies to open within municipal limits, because the alternative is Wal*Mart opens outside city limits and the municipality receives no tax receipts.  Wal*Mart opens, and scores of mom-and-pop businesses fail.  Several years later, when the property tax abatements expire, Wal*Mart closes the store and re-locates 2 miles outside city limits, leaving a ghost town behind.Like Super Size Me and The Smartest Guys in the Room, this film is about corporate leadership and values.  The vacuum of responsible leadership in Wal*Mart's case - at least as portrayed in this movie - is chilling and disgraceful.If Super Size me made you think twice about your next Big Mac, this film will give you similar reservations about purchasing from Wal*Mart.

They negatively impact the lives of underpaid/uninsured associates and taxpayers at large who end up being affected by subsidies Wal-Mart obtains and the burden they indirectly pose on the system by having so many of their associates rely on government programs for health, food and housing. By pushing to bankruptcy many local small businesses, they typically become the largest employers in the markets where they arrive, leaving low-income workers with little option if they want to stay in their towns.Not having read much about Sam Walton's original vision, I can imagine him not being cool with the way things have turned with the business he founded.

Rognlien,"[9, 12]","While other documentaries are made more professionally and with better finishing, the scope of this one in particular (given its budget) is impressive.On one hand, the filmmakers had it easy, because the crimes and abuses committed by Wal Mart are well-documented in the thousands of lawsuits filed against it by citizens, government regulators, current and former employees, etc.  Yet on the other, I think they did a good job of telling the story from a personalized perspective and showed the impact of WM and its practices on the communities in which it does business.I'm fortunate to live in Seattle, where the only Wal Mart / Sam's Club locations are out in the 'sticks' and no possibility of getting any closer (there's no room and we're too liberal, thank goodness).  However, to those Americans who have the evil boxes in close proximity: don't think that the pricetag on the items you buy from WM are reflective of the overall costs to you.  They do not reflect the massive tax and social burdens placed on you and your communities by the grossly underpaid/unbenefitted employees who rely on your state and local welfare/public assistance systems to keep their heads above water.  They do not account for the environmental and social impact of a company that writes checks instead of righting wrongs.  They do not account for the massive widening of the gap between the haves and the have-nots in our country.Is the extra couple hundred bucks a year you MAY spend at other stores that DO pay/treat employees fairly worth it?

935461,A1KI6L82M5RAHQ,B000AYNG1G,mr. snrub,"[12, 15]","WAL-MART: THE HIGH COST OF LOW PRICE is a fantastic documentary about coporate greed and the P.R. facades put on by Wal-mart CEO's to convince people that Wal-mart is run by generous millionares who care about their employees. Being a former Wal-mart associate myself, I found this documentary to be incendiary, challenging and thought-provoking (though I imagine there are Wal-mart associates out there who had the same reaction to this film as some (but not all; in fact, probably not too many) American Republican soldiers had to Michael Moore's masterpiece, FAHRENHEIT 9/11, but that's their loss.)The film begins with Wal-Mart CEO Lee Scott once again proclaiming Wal-mart to be the richest compnay in the galaxy and all of the wealth is being distributed fairly. But it almost seems that the associates of Wal-Mart, the company whose goods are sold by my former employer, etc is actually destroying them. In HIGH COST OF LOW PRICE, every time a new Wal-mart is opened up in a small, rural American town, It is good for the economy. Who's economy? Apparantly not the small, family owned businessess almost immediately shut down by Wal-mart's 'kill em all, let God sort 'em out' approach to dealing with ""competition"". And when Wal-mart's supplier's must outsource their products to Chinese sweatshops where works make about $3.00 per day to keep up with what Wal-mart is willing to pay, nobody seems to care.But being that my employment at Wal-mart was brief, I was stunned to hear Store managers confess to have followed orders to cheat asscociates out of overtime. Even more stunning is the revealation that few Wal-mart associates can actually afford Wal-mart's health care plan, and are actually encouraged by Wal-mart to apply for taxpayer-funded public-assistance programs. This coming from the richest compnay in the World????All that was new to me, but I can state unequivically that when HIGH COST OF LOW PRICE speaks of Wal-marts agressive anti-unionization, it is true. Wal-mart will deny up and down that they are anti-union, but believe me when I tell you that the training videos associates like myself watch almost immediately only tell soon-to-be associates of the cons of unionizing, but leaves out any pro's. Any union activity detected in any Wal-mart is grounds for being fired.There's much more within HIGH COST OF LOW PRICE, and it's not an entirely grim story. Director Robert Greenwald brings clips of CEO Lee Scott telling blatant lies about Wal-mart's concern for the environment, it's own asscociates, and anything else other than money, and Scott being mocked by the one, the only, JON STEWART!!!!!! But it does have it's darker moments, such as the revealation that Wal-mart is fully aware that the vast majority of it's crimes takes place in it's parking lots, and Wal-mart simply not being willing to paying for security guards and the like outside, even knowing that doing so could almost completly eliminate Wal-mart crimes.But I encourage all people, including past and present Wal-mart associates to see HIGH COST OF LOW PRICE.

935462,A2SA6LR78V49UV,B000AYNG1G,"OrangeCrush ""Still shooting with Film!""","[2, 2]","I had heard a lot of bad stories regarding Wal-Mart even before watching this film so I wasn't really shocked by a lot of the information contained in this film. For example I have known for quite some time that Wal-Mart shuns American made products and that commercial property values plummet when Wal-Mart makes its public that they will be building a store in a particular community. I was also aware of the low wages and the keeping employees at part time so they cant qualify for certain benefits like medical insurance. With that being said I was still in a state of disgust and disbelief after watching this film.Wal-Mart is basically the epitome of the evil corporation who puts profits over EVERYTHING else including the well being of their employees and the safety of their customers. While this film is not perfect in the presentation of its argument, it does a good enough job for people to get the point and that point is that Wal-Mart is greedy, negligent, tyrannical, exploitative, and corrupt and will do whatever it can to increase profits. This is a corporation that cares only about one thing and one thing only and that is its bottom line sales wise.The US government is supposed to stop monopolies from existing yet everywhere we look today we see mega corporations who absolutely dominate their respective markets. Wal-Mart is the very essence of a monopoly as not only do they dominate their respective market, they also try and squash any competition that exists even if its some small family owned store that poses no threat whatsoever to Wal-Marts total sales. The fact that this is a company that basically refuses to sell American made products just makes our governments non involvement that much more pathetic.I for one have NEVER shopped at Wal-Mart. That's right, I have never spent a single penny in a Wal-Mart store. I have been inside a Wal-Mart a couple of times but I myself have never purchased anything. Initially my not shopping at Wal-Mart had absolutely nothing to do with any of this, it was simply a store that I had no interest in whatsoever. Now that I understand Wal-Marts true nature, I wont even step foot in a Wal-Mart store. I don't care if they start selling HDTV's for 1 penny each. I am proud of the fact that I have never shopped there and that is something that I will stand by until the day I die or at the very least until they implement some very serious changes to their way of practicing business. My entire family now actively seeks out American made products and we also make it a point to give at least some of our business to the ""smaller companies"" out there. That may sound disingenuous coming from someone who shops at Amazon but its 100% true. Besides, Amazon employs a system that actually helps some of the smaller companies out there as lets face it, some of them would not exist at all if it weren't for Amazon Marketplace.I wound up giving this film a 4 star rating instead of a 5 star rating simply because this film gets a little sloppy at times in regards to its presentation of data, or in some cases its lack of data. With that being said this documentary does a great job getting its overall message across and ultimately its a film that every single American should see.The Bottom line - People really need to start taking an active interest in who they are giving their money too. Price simply cannot be the bottom line as there are far more important issues at stake here than just saving a few extra dollars. If people actually took the time to learn whats behind those cheap prices, I have no doubt that a very large percentage of those people would never come back. Wal-Mart is a company that basically stands opposed to the very idea of a free market. In fact certain aspects of Wal-Marts business practices are nothing short of criminal and the fact that the US justice dept hasn't gotten involved yet is a testament to just how much lobbying power Wal-Mart has and just how corrupt our own government has become.Watch this film and just say no to Wal-Mart!4 Stars!!",4,A Film Every American Needs to See!,1259884800,"12 4, 2009",2009,4054,"['had', 'heard', 'lot', 'bad', 'stories', 'regarding', 'Wal-Mart', 'even', 'watching', 'film', 'so', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'shocked', 'lot', 'information', 'contained', 'film', 'example', 'have', 'known', 'quite', 'time', 'Wal-Mart', 'shuns', 'American', 'made', 'products', 'commercial', 'property', 'values', 'plummet', 'when', 'Wal-Mart', 'public', 'will', 'be', 'building', 'store', 'particular', 'community', 'was', 'also', 'aware', 'low', 'wages', 'keeping', 'employees', 'part', 'time', 'cant', 'qualify', 'certain', 'benefits', 'medical', 'insurance', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'still', 'state', 'disgust', 'disbelief', 'watching', 'film.Wal-Mart', 'basically', 'epitome', 'evil', 'corporation', 'who', 'profits', 'EVERYTHING', 'else', 'including', 'well', 'being', 'employees', 'safety', 'customers', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'presentation', 'argument', 'good', 'enough', 'job', 'people', 'get', 'point', 'point', 'Wal-Mart', 'greedy', 'negligent', 'tyrannical', 'exploitative', 'corrupt', 'will', 'do', 'whatever', 'can', 'increase', 'profits', 'corporation', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'one', 'thing', 'only', 'bottom', 'line', 'sales', 'wise.The', 'US', 'government', 'supposed', 'stop', 'monopolies', 'existing', 'yet', 'everywhere', 'look', 'today', 'see', 'mega', 'corporations', 'who', 'absolutely', 'dominate', 'respective', 'markets', 'Wal-Mart', 'very', 'essence', 'monopoly', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'dominate', 'respective', 'market', 'also', 'try', 'squash', 'competition', 'even', 'small', 'family', 'owned', 'store', 'threat', 'whatsoever', 'Wal-Marts', 'total', 'sales', 'fact', 'company', 'basically', 'sell', 'American', 'made', 'products', 'just', 'governments', 'involvement', 'much', 'more', 'pathetic.I', 'one', 'have', 'NEVER', 'shopped', 'Wal-Mart', 'right', 'have', 'never', 'spent', 'single', 'penny', 'Wal-Mart', 'store', 'have', 'been', 'Wal-Mart', 'couple', 'times', 'have', 'never', 'purchased', 'anything', 'Initially', 'not', 'shopping', 'Wal-Mart', 'had', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'was', 'simply', 'store', 'had', 'interest', 'whatsoever', 'Now', 'understand', 'Wal-Marts', 'true', 'nature', 'wont', 'even', 'step', 'foot', 'Wal-Mart', 'store', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'start', 'selling', 'HDTV', '1', 'penny', 'am', 'proud', 'fact', 'have', 'never', 'shopped', 'there', 'something', 'will', 'stand', 'day', 'die', 'very', 'least', 'implement', 'very', 'serious', 'changes', 'way', 'practicing', 'business', 'My', 'entire', 'family', 'now', 'actively', 'out', 'American', 'made', 'products', 'also', 'make', 'point', 'give', 'least', 'business', 'smaller', 'companies', 'there', 'may', 'sound', 'disingenuous', 'coming', 'someone', 'who', 'Amazon', '100', '%', 'true', 'Amazon', 'system', 'actually', 'smaller', 'companies', 'out', 'there', 'lets', 'face', 'would', 'not', 'exist', 'were', ""n't"", 'Amazon', 'Marketplace.I', 'wound', 'up', 'giving', 'film', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'instead', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'simply', 'film', 'little', 'sloppy', 'times', 'regards', 'presentation', 'data', 'cases', 'lack', 'data', 'being', 'said', 'documentary', 'great', 'job', 'getting', 'overall', 'message', 'ultimately', 'film', 'single', 'American', 'should', 'see.The', 'Bottom', 'line', 'People', 'really', 'need', 'start', 'taking', 'active', 'interest', 'who', 'are', 'giving', 'money', 'too', 'Price', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'bottom', 'line', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'issues', 'stake', 'here', 'just', 'saving', 'few', 'extra', 'dollars', 'people', 'actually', 'took', 'time', 'learn', 'whats', 'cheap', 'prices', 'have', 'doubt', 'very', 'large', 'percentage', 'people', 'would', 'never', 'come', 'back', 'Wal-Mart', 'company', 'basically', 'opposed', 'very', 'idea', 'free', 'market', 'fact', 'certain', 'aspects', 'Wal-Marts', 'business', 'practices', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'criminal', 'fact', 'US', 'justice', 'dept', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'involved', 'yet', 'testament', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'lobbying', 'power', 'Wal-Mart', 'just', 'how', 'corrupt', 'own', 'government', 'become.Watch', 'film', 'just', 'say', 'Wal-Mart', '4', 'Stars']",Walmart: The High Cost of Low Price

I can also attest that these comments were written before the documentary was released to the public, on November 15th.  How would an average consumer have seen the movie before it was released?  The answer is, they didn't, the nay sayers aren't average consumers.The documentary is well done, not sensationalized at all.  Can you stand the thought that hundreds of thousands of full time Walmart employees are on various forms of government healthcare and programs?  Can you ignore the fact that employees are constantly threatened with losing their job, if they do not work off the clock, in order to keep payroll low for Walmart?  Do you sleep well at night knowing that the Waltons donate next to nothing to local charities, even towards helping their own employees?  Do you care that they have all the government lobbyists to make sure they never pay their share of taxes, while the little store down the street pays his fair share?Understand why Walmart has lower prices? They hire employees at a low wage ($12k per year - full time, no benefits or retirement.)  Then, they dupe them out of their full paycheck to save even more. They have their own sweatshot factories in China and other third world countries, extracting mandatory rent from employees and paying them $3 per day to work dawn to dusk.  They avoid local taxes, they disregard local businesses, in fact, driving around towns and making bets how fast the mom and pops will go out of business after the Walmart opens its doors.It's not the poor checker at Walmart ...she's not the bad guy.  It's the owners of Walmart, the CEO of Walmart and other share holders and upper managment.Bottom line - you cannot shop at Walmart if you there is an alternative place to shop.

For some reason they cut some people off before they're able to finish a sentence and it's very jarring. They do this frequently too. Somebody will be talking and then all the sudden they cut somebody else. There are also audio problems in the movie.

935474,A1S8AJIUIO6M9K,B000AYNG1G,Robert David STEELE Vivas,"[29, 39]","This is an important and absorbing documentary.  I have nine note cards on it, and I summarize the key points that this DVD makes because I believe it should be shown in every town hall meeting where a Wal-Mart exists or threatens to arrive.The bottom line is that the Wal-Mart family of five had made over 100 billion dollars on the backs of its ""slave"" employees in the US and in China, and Wal-Mart can and should be viewed as a front from the Chinese government, as a means of undermining the US economy while building up the Chinese economy.  Throughout this DVD (and in the book that inspired it) hard documented incontrovertible facts are provided with respect to the manner in which Wal-Mart is subsidized by the taxpayer (e.g. over $80 million a year in assistance to Wal-Mart employees in Florida that qualify for below the poverty line assistance)--the cost to taxpayers across the country is said to total over $1.5 BILLION; Wal-Mart also fails to meet its obligations, either in return for tax abatements, or in response to consent decrees when it has been found guilty of pollution or other crimes.*  Wal-Mart does not pay fair wages and is violently anti-union to include illegal surveillance and intimidation.  They short-change payroll and demand off the clock overtime, which is illegal, in order to increase their profits.  The personal stories told in this DVD about employees having to choose between eating lunch or buying medicine for their children are not only heart-rending, but remind me of Third World countries where the same choice has to be made by mothers.  PEOPLE POWER IS STARTING TO WORK:  Wal-Mart is losing hundreds of law suits across the country to employees suing for off the clock cheating.*  Wal-Mart lies a lot.  It lies about its contributions to communities (there is clear documentation that Wal-Mart destroys communities and destroys the small businesses for hundreds of miles around).  Wal-Mart lies about its benefits, its wages, its environmental concerns, it lies about almost everything.  I have the note ""hypocritical liars.""*  Wal-Mart is eroding global labor standards.  They fire their own inspectors for doing their jobs and telling the truth.*  Wal-Mart parking lots are very very unsafe.  Wal-Mart has known since 1994 that their parking lots attract a great deal of crime including night-time rapes and murders, and they have also known since 1994 that a couple of unarmed security guards in uniforms riding around in golf carts would eliminate almost ALL of that crime, but they are not willing to pay for that safety just as they are not willing to pay for living wages for their employees.*  Wal-Mart has established a clear and well-documented pattern of lying to courts--of flagrant active perjury.*  PEOPLE POWER II:  ""plantation capitalism"" will forever be linked to Wal-Mart, but the wonderful news is that the people are starting to fight back, and across America, Wal-Mart is being stopped in its tracks from hijacking local planning processes and buying out city councils.Two additional points not covered by the documentary:*  Reviewer John Staffa does us all a favor in pointing out that Hillary Clinton was a member of the Wal-Mart board and profited from the relationship.  This simply drives home the point that Democratic ""leaders"" are simply ""Republican Lite"" and no longer really interested in supporting labor unions and people's rights.*  I have reviewed many books on the end of cheap oil, and many of them make the point that companies like Wal-Mart can bring all those goods from China to the USA because of the cheap oil, which is no more.  In 1974-1979 the Senate and the White House knew full well that Peak Oil was upon us.  They made the treasonous decision back then to conceal this from the public and take no action in order to keep the bribes from the energy companies, and the illusion of cheap gas going.  Both Wal-Mart and the US Government have essentially lied to the US public and acted against the long-term public interest.  It's time we tax them back.I strongly recommend this movie as a means of mobilizing support for blocking all new Wal-Marts, and for beginning the process of closing down existing Wal-Marts.  The facts are incontrovertible.  Wal-Mart kills communities.  Wal-Mart is now, like Standard Oil and Exxon today, like AT&T; and Microsoft, a company that has gotten pathologically powerful and needs to be broken up.This DVD, and ""The Corporation"" DVD, are both essential tools in nurturing a new movement to take back the power over the US economy and the corrupt US political system.

935475,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B000AYNG1G,Robert J. Crawford,"[15, 17]","I had to watch this film because I am embarking on a big writing project on wal-mart.  It is intended as a no-holds-barred indictment of the company, and at this it is utterly relentless and does not seek any sense of fair balance or acknowledge the full complexity of the issues.The film is divided into the familiar themes of wal-mart critics, namely, the devastating effect that the company can have on businesses in the communities it enters, the alleged treatment of its ""associates"", its global sweatshop network, its political activities, and its apparent indifference to its impact, etc.While there is a lot of truth in these allegations, I would have liked a more honest attempt at providing a more neutral perspective. People go to wal-mart because its business model (consistently cheap prices, huge scale economies, and an incredibly efficient supply/logistic chain) works - that is indisputable and should serve as a starting point for any understanding of what the company does and why.That being said, the film will serve anti-wal-mart activists admirably:  there is no question that there is a huge groundswell of criticism and protest against the company, and it better take heed.The device used in the film is to show tapes of wal-mart CEO Lee Scott and/or wal-mart commercials - to show how wal-mart wishes to portray itself - and then to seek points of view that contradict these statements.  This, in my opinion as a specialist in corporate social responsibility, is an extremely useful way for activists to get at the company.  If it doesn't live up to its stated ideals, let the people know.  While the film is lopsided in its portrayal, this rightly appears quite devastating.  The viewer wonders if wal-mart is the standard oil or railroads, so reviled in the guilded age, for our era.Furthermore, the film charges that Scott's statements are lies and a conscious sham, deviously engineered for appearences without any basis in reality.  I do not know if I wd go that far, as corporations are massive organizations and there is a difference between local implementation and the real intentions of its top leadership.  Nevertheless, former wal-mart managers attest to this accusation in the film, including a tearful one who claims he was fired for attempting to point our contradictions between the company's rhetoric and practices.  Again, this can be a tool of activists to get the company to pay attention to critics, particularly through media campaigns.However, when the film got into details that I knew about from previous reporting work (i.e. by my own witness), I tired of its bias and lack of nuance.  For example, there is a section on how poorly Chinese workers are treated.  In a word, they are by our standards, but many of them are so poor that they are thankful for the work, which allows unskilled girls to save dowwery payments, proletariat workers to create businesses in their home regions when they return, and to support elederly parents.  Moreover, the companies that hire them are subcontractors of wal-mart and hence not under its direct control - that means that wal-mart must monitor them and then induce them to change their policies, which to put it mildly is easier said than done.  As such, while they deserve better work environments, the questions of how to achieve that and what is realistic in an underdeveloped economy are very complex (though not undoable in my view, whatever measures are taken may never satisfy critics).  None of this was addressed in the film, which merely portrayed the workers as angry by one couple's experience.  Regretably, this made the rest of the film suspect to me, as I wondered what else was portrayed so one-sidedly.One of the more interesting aspects of the film is a bit on grassroots campaigns to block the establishment of new wal-marts in certain communities, some of which were run by Republican conservatives.  The company ignores this at its peril.  It is the type of challenge that will eventually impact its bottom line, though I doubt activists could ever kill the company.To sum up, I did not learn much from this film.  wal-mart is controversial, and its policies have multiple levels of impacts - e.g. it can help employees, but it uses them as well. Any business does that.  But it does offer a vivid portrayal of why activists want to attack the company, which I will certainly use in my work. These attacks will only increase, in my view, and rightly so.  Witness, for example, a story I saw this morning in the newspapers:  Maryland passed legistlation to force wal-mart to provide better health insurance coverage, with the specific intent of getting wal-mart employees off of the welfare rolls!  That is extremely powerful stuff and may serve as a template for other states.  As such, wal-mart critics are part of a political movement and not mere consumer or labor advocates.I think that wal-mart is at a turning point.  It can either listen to critics and begin to change policies that were designed for a particular place and time - when it was a mid-west company in rural southern areas, where its policies fit and were genuinely appreciated - and now has become a global superpower on a vastly different scale.  Or it can adopt a bunker mentality, leavened by a purely public relations strategy, that is, dismissing its critics' arguments as unfair and attempting to address them solely by spin.With these observations in mind, I would recommend this film - with caution.",3,"All the cons, none of the pros, but effective nonetheless",1137110400,"01 13, 2006",2006,5491,"['had', 'watch', 'film', 'am',

935478,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B000AYNG1G,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[16, 28]","Let's say that I am an american and I opened up a small business.  Something simple.  Let's say....a toy store.I buy all my toys in america made by toy makers in america.  These are americans working american jobs, paying taxes to america, and all around supporting the independence of being proud americans.All of a sudden, a Wal-Mart comes to my town.  Wal-Mart also sells toys.  Toys made in other countries, by countries that give their employees as little as possible to manufacture their toys.  Wal-Mart goes to those countries to buy their low cost toy products because it will be cheaper for Wal-Mart to give our american money to them, instead of putting that money back into our own countries economy.Hence, the end result is this. Wal-Mart screws american employees, and the american economy for it's own selfish profits.  So, since I can't sell my american manufactured toys cheaper than Wal-Mart, I guess I'll just have to go ""out of business"".  I can't compete with a company that has a secondary to maybe a nil interest in supporting america and american jobs.  Sure, they may pay alot of taxes to the big-whig beneficiaries of american government.  A small handful of ""already wealthy"" people who get to share in Wal-Mart's profits (while being asked to look the other way when negative statistics begin to reveal themselves), but still...what about jobs in america?  What about the value of an american manufactured product?  Is price more important than quality?  I guess our own government couldn't care less if we can't find jobs, just as long as they are getting to share in the big money from that one single strong financial entity.  That ""American Economy Threatening Profit Monger"" known as ""Wal-Mart"".This may very well be the closest to the simplified truth about Wal-Mart's impact on america.  You don't need to watch a tainted documentary on a series of half-truths to know the reality of Wal-Mart's harm to america.  Just look around you.  There are people who benefit from Wal-Mart, and there are people who really lose.  Unfortunately, it's hard to see how many people really lose when you are just as guilty as I am when we go to Wal-Mart to get that ""lowest price"".  We shopper's really are the guilty ones if you want to blame someone for Wal-Mart's ""power of influence"" to the leaders of labor camps and sweat shops overseas.  We, the consumer, are contributing to the ruination of america's product-manufacturing economy.  Just think about that the next time you go to Wal-Mart.And think about this, too:  Before you go buy that ""special toy"" at Wal-Mart for that special child that you love, think of that child overseas, who knows no real childhood, who's been forced into labor at a very young age, and who was probably screamed at or even beatened for making that ""special toy"" wrong the first time.  Christmas overseas must be just as scary to some children as Thanksgiving would be to ""live"" turkeys.But, they're not your kids, so don't worry about it.  Those kids overseas probably have nothing better to do anyway.",4,"You don't need to rely on the film, if you just take this into consideration",1132272000,"11 18, 2005",2005,3059,"['Let', 'say', 'am', 'american', 'opened', 'up', 'small', 'business', 'Something', 'simple', 'Let', 'say', 'toy', 'store.I', 'buy', 'toys', 'america', 'made', 'toy', 'makers', 'america', 'are', 'americans', 'working', 'american', 'jobs', 'paying', 'taxes', 'america', 'supporting', 'independence', 'being', 'proud', 'americans.All', 'sudden', 'Wal-Mart', 'town', 'Wal-Mart', 'also', 'toys', 'Toys', 'made', 'other', 'countries', 'countries', 'give', 'employees', 'as', 'little', 'possible', 'manufacture', 'toys', 'Wal-Mart', 'countries', 'buy', 'low', 'cost', 'toy', 'products', 'will', 'be', 'cheaper', 'Wal-Mart', 'give', 'american', 'money', 'instead', 'putting', 'money', 'back', 'own', 'countries', 'economy.Hence', 'end', 'result', 'Wal-Mart', 'screws', 'american', 'employees', 'american', 'economy', 'own', 'selfish', 'profits', 'So', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sell', 'american', 'manufactured', 'cheaper', 'Wal-Mart', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'go', 'business', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compete', 'company', 'secondary', 'maybe', 'nil', 'interest', 'supporting', 'america', 'american', 'jobs', 'Sure', 'may', 'pay', 'alot', 'taxes', 'big-whig', 'beneficiaries', 'american', 'government', 'small', 'handful', 'already', 'wealthy', 'people', 'who', 'get', 'share', 'Wal-Mart', 'profits', 'being', 'asked', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'when', 'negative', 'statistics', 'begin', 'reveal', 'still', 'what', 'jobs', 'america', 'What', 'value', 'american', 'manufactured', 'product', 'price', 'more', 'important', 'quality', 'guess', 'own', 'government', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'jobs', 'just', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'getting', 'share', 'big', 'money', 'one', 'single', 'strong', 'financial', 'entity', 'American', 'Economy', 'Threatening', 'Profit', 'Monger', 'known', 'Wal-Mart', '.This', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'closest', 'simplified', 'truth', 'Wal-Mart', 'impact', 'america', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'watch', 'tainted', 'documentary', 'series', 'half-truths', 'know', 'reality', 'Wal-Mart', 'harm', 'america', 'Just', 'look', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'benefit', 'Wal-Mart', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'lose', 'Unfortunately', 'hard', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'really', 'lose', 'when', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'guilty', 'am', 'when', 'go', 'Wal-Mart', 'get', 'lowest', 'price', 'shopper', 'really', 'are', 'guilty', 'ones', 'want', 'blame', 'someone', 'Wal-Mart', 'power', 'influence', 'leaders', 'labor', 'camps', 'sweat', 'shops', 'overseas', 'consumer', 'are', 'contributing', 'ruination', 'america', 'product-manufacturing', 'economy', 'Just', 'think', 'next', 'time', 'go', 'Wal-Mart.And', 'think', 'too', 'go', 'buy', 'special', 'toy', 'Wal-Mart', 'special', 'child', 'love', 'think', 'child', 'overseas', 'who', 'real', 'childhood', 'who', 'been', 'forced', 'labor', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'who', 'was', 'probably', 'screamed', 'even', 'beatened', 'making', 'special', 'toy', 'first', 'time', 'Christmas', 'overseas', 'must', 'be', 'just', 'scary', 'children', 'Thanksgiving', 'would', 'be', 'live', 'turkeys.But', ""'re"", 'not', 'kids', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'kids', 'overseas', 'probably', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'anyway']",Walmart: The High Cost of Low Price

I have heard that we shouldn't shop there, but, I didn't really want to hear it. Hard to change - old dog, new tricks. But, I rented the DVD and saw it tonight.Wow.I can't shop there anymore. Rats.Sam Walton may have been a swell guy, but, his kids and the CEO are money hungry evil greedy pigs. Billions of dollars in their pockets and they can't even give employees a fair deal? Unpaid overtime, heath care issues, lies, threats of being fired if one doesn't stay in line etc.The sad part is how small business in a town close down anytime a new Wal-mart comes to that town. Family owned hardware stores, that were in business for 30 - 40 years, shut down due to loss of customers to Wally. Very sad. Workers in China and other countries that work for pennies in Wal-mart sweat shops, very sad.Ecological violations, murder in the parking lots, all ignored by Wal-mart. Things that could be solved with a little bit of money and common sense, but they choose to not address it. Bottom line is the money, at the expence of people's lives.As for the documentary itself, it kept my interest, the people were real and interesting, the direction etc good.As I live in Microsoft land, neighbor of Bill Gates, I found it interesting that Mr. Gates gives away 50% of his income to charities, and that the Walton family gives like zip.

935480,ANA2PVMARGY8H,B000AYNG1G,"Sarah ""Bookworm/cat person""","[7, 9]","I admit that I have shopped at Wal-mart in the past, saving a few dollars here and there.  Now I no longer can in good conscience.  I can hardly blame Wal-mart for all of the problems of corporate America, but this company does set a precedence for business practices.  This movie is admittedly biased, and I try not to take any one source at face value without further investigation.  However, this scathing documentary does seem consistent with the chronic exposes about Wal-mart in the daily papers and evening news.When I heard the young Chinese woman and her boyfriend complain about the long working hours and mandatory dormitory (whether workers choose to live in the factory dormitories or not, payment for rent is automatically deducted from their paychecks), I kept thinking to myself that these young people belong in graduate school, not slaving over cheaply manufactured exports.  Wal-mart and other corporations definitely take advantage of workers in third-world countries. And in our own country, we see that Wal-mart can become a modern day ""company store,"" preying on single mothers for their dual roles as employees and consumers. (What little of their paycheck remains goes back to Wal-mart for groceries and supplies.)Lee Scott seems to be a very self-deceived man.  You can twist any situation around and end up describing it as exactly the opposite of what it is in reality, while convincing yourself and others that ""bad is good and good is bad.""  Lee seems to rationalize the corporation's business practices because Wal-mart provides cheap prices for working families; therefore, he's doing his part for America and the economy.  But what sort of corporation would actively encourage its employees to seek Medicaid and W.I.C. in order to avoid providing health care (with affordable co-pays and deductibles) and a living wage?  (Lest I be misunderstood, there is no shame in seeking governmental services and subsidies, and I'm glad that such programs are available to those who need them.) The word ""union"" is considered an obscenity and omnipresent threat for Wal-mart executives.Safety in Wal-mart parking lots has been an issue.  What's the point of having cameras at every angle if no one is there to observe them?  With Wal-mart's astronomical profits, it is well within the budget to provide stores with effective security.  Wal-mart also had a tacit (or not so tacit) policy of pressuring employees to work overtime without pay (or if they are given credit for extra hours, it will be tallied on the next time sheet to avoid paying overtime).  Now whether every district manager enforces this exploitative practice is another matter, but this is still disturbing.This documentary was one-sided (when it showed Wal-mart's promotional videos, spokespersons, and commercials, Wal-mart's claims would be contradicted (to the point of being farcical) by statistics or anecdotes in the following scenes), but I don't think the worst of the complaints are much of a stretch.In the spirit of Morgan Spurlock (Supersize Me), this movie elucidates the high cost of cutting corners and taking advantage of people. In the final analysis, the economics of doing it right the first time (that is, ethical business practices) are comparable to all the fines, lawsuits, and sullied reputations of doing it the wrong way.",4,A corporation without much of a conscience,1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,3338,"['admit', 'have', 'shopped', 'Wal-mart', 'past', 'saving', 'few', 'dollars', 'here', 'there', 'Now', 'no', 'longer', 'can', 'good', 'conscience', 'can', 'hardly', 'blame', 'Wal-mart', 'problems', 'corporate', 'America', 'company', 'set', 'precedence', 'business', 'practices', 'movie', 'admittedly', 'biased', 'try', 'not', 'take', 'one', 'source', 'face', 'value', 'further', 'investigation', 'However', 'scathing', 'documentary', 'seem', 'consistent', 'chronic', 'exposes', 'Wal-mart', 'daily', 'papers', 'evening', 'news.When', 'heard', 'young', 'Chinese', 'woman', 'boyfriend', 'complain', 'long', 'working', 'hours', 'mandatory', 'dormitory', 'workers', 'choose', 'live', 'factory', 'dormitories', 'not', 'payment', 'rent', 'automatically', 'deducted', 'paychecks', 'kept', 'thinking', 'myself', 'young', 'people', 'belong', 'graduate', 'school', 'not', 'slaving', 'cheaply', 'manufactured', 'exports', 'Wal-mart', 'other', 'corporations', 'definitely', 'take', 'advantage', 'workers', 'third-world', 'countries', 'own', 'country', 'see', 'Wal-mart', 'can', 'become', 'modern', 'day', 'company', 'store', 'preying', 'single', 'mothers', 'dual', 'roles', 'employees', 'consumers', 'What', 'little', 'paycheck', 'back', 'Wal-mart', 'groceries', 'supplies', 'Lee', 'Scott', 'be', 'very', 'self-deceived', 'man', 'can', 'twist', 'situation', 'around', 'end', 'up', 'describing', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'what', 'reality', 'convincing', 'others', 'bad', 'good', 'good', 'bad', 'Lee', 'rationalize', 'corporation', 'business', 'practices', 'Wal-mart', 'cheap', 'prices', 'working', 'families', 'therefore', 'doing', 'part', 'America', 'economy', 'what', 'sort', 'corporation', 'would', 'actively', 'encourage', 'employees', 'seek', 'Medicaid', 'W.I.C', 'order', 'avoid', 'providing', 'health', 'care', 'affordable', 'co-pays', 'deductibles', 'living', 'wage', 'Lest', 'be', 'misunderstood', 'shame', 'seeking', 'governmental', 'services', 'subsidies', ""'m"", 'glad', 'such', 'programs', 'are', 'available', 'who', 'need', 'word', 'union', 'considered', 'obscenity', 'omnipresent', 'threat', 'Wal-mart', 'executives.Safety', 'Wal-mart', 'parking', 'lots', 'been', 'issue', 'What', 'point', 'having', 'cameras', 'angle', 'one', 'there', 'observe', 'Wal-mart', 'astronomical', 'profits', 'well', 'budget', 'provide', 'stores', 'effective', 'security', 'Wal-mart', 'also', 'had', 'tacit', 'not', 'so', 'tacit', 'policy', 'pressuring', 'employees', 'work', 'overtime', 'pay', 'are', 'given', 'credit', 'extra', 'hours', 'will', 'be', 'tallied', 'next', 'time', 'sheet', 'avoid', 'paying', 'overtime', 'Now', 'district', 'manager', 'exploitative', 'practice', 'matter', 'still', 'disturbing.This', 'documentary', 'was', 'one-sided', 'when', 'showed', 'Wal-mart', 'promotional', 'videos', 'spokespersons', 'commercials', 'Wal-mart', 'claims', 'would', 'be', 'contradicted', 'point', 'being', 'farcical', 'statistics', 'anecdotes', 'following', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'worst', 'complaints', 'are', 'much', 'stretch.In', 'spirit', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'Supersize', 'Me', 'movie', 'high', 'cost', 'cutting', 'corners', 'taking', 'advantage', 'people', 'final', 'analysis', 'economics', 'doing', 'right', 'first', 'time', 'ethical', 'business', 'practices', 'are', 'comparable', 'fines', 'lawsuits', 'sullied', 'reputations', 'doing', 'wrong', 'way']",Walmart: The High Cost of Low Price
935481,A2PN7Z2VTHICL8,B000AYNG1G,"Schtinky ""Schtinky""","[167, 185]","'Wal Mart, The High Cost Of Low Price' is filled with first hand testimonials and some hard-fact figures that will help in validating your hatred of this greedy giant, and visually exposes those in other countries who are ruthlessly used as slaves to produce the cheap products you purchase when you patronize this monolith.These ""jobs"" provided to the labor forces of India, China, Bangladesh, and Mexico are not 'good wage' jobs even for third world standards.  The people are overworked, underpaid, and forced to work in sub-human conditions.  These human beings make 13 to 17 cents and hour, and work 10 to 18 hour days without breaks, all so you can have that $1.49 blouse.Exposed in this film are the squalid, rent controlled apartments in China, provided by the company, that put to shame the most rancid ghetto house in your hometown.  And if the employee chooses not to live in these rat-infested housing developments, the rent is still deducted from their wages.  Wal-Mart has managed to lower the work standards set for these hard-pressed, low wage, third-world countries that other companies are going to follow, sucking down the standards of working all across the world.The manager of the Mexico factories went on a tour to make sure that working conditions were humane.  He was fired when he reported that the conditions were intolerably inhumane.  In his own words, he didn't think retaliation would be brought against him for doing his job.If you think it was a good thing that America abolished slavery, then think again before you go into a Wal-Mart.  Just because the US is no longer ""importing"" slaves, doesn't make it right to continue to use slavery in other countries to produce high profits for personal gain.  Wal-Mart's practices are no different than bringing slaves over from Africa to pick our cotton, it's still a cheap way for the rich to get richer at the expense of human blood and sweat.Intermittently inserted in the film is a speech made by Lee Scott to the high-end employees and stockholders of Wal-Mart, which sounds very much like an Amway pep-talk.  Lee Scott's earnings for 2005 were $27,207,799.00.  The average Wal-Mart hourly employee's was $13,861.00.Interesting facts:  After 9/11, the Walton's built themselves an underground bunker in case of another terrorist attack, costing millions of dollars that should have went into paying back the Government for having to subsidize their employee's un-affordable medical benefits.The Walton family gave less than 1% of their wealth to charity.  Bill Gates, not even a nice man himself, gave 58%.The ""Critical Need"" fund, set up to assist Wal-Mart employees in emergencies, received five million dollars from Wal-Mart employees (making $13,861.00 annually) and only $6,000.00 from the Walton family, who made, collectively, 102 billion.Wal-Mart actually had a commercial campaign about ""buying American"" while all their products come from sweatshops overseas.Wal-Mart has refused to address crime statistics that show an upswing of violent crime in their large, remote, under-lit and un-protected parking lots, putting their customers in danger and taxing the local law enforcement.  The State of California alone paid out 80 Million dollars in medical benefits to poverty-level Wal-Mart employees because the 102 Billion Dollar Walton family does not want to give their ""associates"" fair medical benefits.There are many ways to hate Wal-Mart and its ilk, and many books out on the subject, but I recommend watching this DVD so you can actually see the slave workers and conditions overseas that these selfish billionaires exploit without passing down their profit to the ""small people"" who helped build their empire.  The presentation could have used a little more snappiness, and the DVD starts out very slow, but keep watching and you will eventually see the monster peeking out from behind your curtain.Stop shopping at Wal-Mart.  Just stop.  You don't need their cheap goods that fall apart two days after you bring them home, and it feels good to know that you make a difference by not supporting slavery.

The documentary takes the viewer on a back and forth ride between what the CEO of Wal-Mart says, and what they, as a corporation, do. Words versus Action. What it really exposes is the fact that the ""every day low prices"" are for paid by someone, whether they be the community, associates or Chinese workers. This show clearly demonstrates the greed of the company and the abuse that the workers suffer. It also shows the direct attack on those wishing to form a collective bargaining unit. The old axiom holds true, you can't get something for nothing, or in this case for a low price. I highly recommend this film and join with those who refuse to support these unethical practices.One more thing that could be added, that isn't shown in this film, is the lobbying Wal-Mart did after Sept 11 to stop the federal government from inspecting more cargo that enters the US because it would cost Wal-Mart in time and sales.

935484,A39T7TMQXZ93YL,B000AYNG1G,"Sithara Batcha ""Sithara""","[8, 11]","""Walmart: The High Cost of Low Price"" by Robert Greenwald is a well-meaning film that makes some pointed criticisms about the giant retailer.  By interviewing people who have been hurt by Walmart as well as former Walmart employees, Greenwald documents many evils committed by the corporate giant:1.  Walmart destroys small, family-owned businesses.  Its not just the fact that Walmart's prices are lower.  Family owned business say that they could compete with lower prices because they provide better service.  However, Walmart gets huge tax subsidies, which small businesses just don't get.2.  Walmart is openly sexist and racist to its employees.  Such attitudes seem to be coming from headquarters.  Women and Blacks are flat-out told they are not management material.  Women are disproportionately assigned demeaning tasks such as cleaning bathrooms.3.  Walmart cheats employees out of millions of dollars of overtime.  Not only does Walmart 'guilt' employees into working those extra hours (by hinting if a particular employee won't do it, they can always get someone else), but managers are actually taught to change employee time cards!4.  Walmart doesn't care about the environment - for example it is willing to leave fertilizers out in the open in its parking lots next to streams providing drinking water.  When it rains, the water is mixed with fertilizer run-off.5.  Walmart is the ultimate union buster - to the level of paranoia.  It can spend more than a million dollars spying on and thwarting one single attempt at unionization - by among other things, flying union busters in on private jets.6.  Walmart uses sweat shops and exploits the labor of Chinese and Latin American workers.  As a Chinese worker says, this is why their products are so cheap.7.  Walmart does not pay its workers properly, nor does it offer benefits.  In fact, it encourages workers to go on Government Assistance (such as Medicaid and food stamps).  Walmart actually provides contact numbers and even teaches employees how to fill out forms!8.  Walmart parking lots are full of crime, including robbery and rape.  Walmart is well aware of this, and even did a study suggesting that putting a guard on patrol greatly reduced parking lot crime.  Of course the study was not implemented.Clearly Walmart is a monstrous corporation.  However, the problem is that the film makes Walmart out to be unique- a particularly twisted entity which cares about profit above all else, no matter what the consequences are.Unfortunately, this is clearly not the case.  Walmart is hardly unique in its lust for profit and its psychopathic inability to care about its effects on others.  All corporations, by definition, are legally mandated to maximize profit.  As for corporate misdeeds past and present, Walmart does not compare all that unfavorably with its fellow corporate giants:Enron - Among its many evils, workers caused blackouts in California and were literally cheering during massive fires in the state because the price of energy skyrocketed.Monsanto - This agricultural corporation is buying up and destroying native (wildtype) seeds around the world, so everyone will have to buy seeds from Monsanto.  It is also using GMO 'terminator' technology to produce seeds which will only produce one harvest (ie, the plants themselves produce sterile seeds) so you have to buy seeds from Monsanto every year!Union Carbide - a massive chemical spill as a result of cost-cutting measures and poor maintenance caused the worst industrial disaster in modern history (1984), killing 3,000 people initially, and at least 15,000 more over the years from cancer, lung disease and birth defects; people are continuing to be affected by the spill.IBM - made massive profits by supplying Nazis with machines to track prisoners of the holocaust.Finally, the film does not also point the finger at us, the average American Walmart shopper.  Why does no one question how Walmart gets its 'low low' prices?  Does anyone really care that Walmart exploits its workers, and cuts on safety and other measures as long as the prices remain oh so low?  Most telling - the movie relates that some exploited Walmart workers, as soon as they get their paychecks, would often use it all up...shopping at Walmart.Saying ""NO"" to Walmart, as this film advocates, will ultimately have little effect.  As another reviewer says, another corporate giant will simply take its place, offering the same low low prices and committing the same evils.  Real change consists of changing our legal and economic systems that currently enshrine profit above all else.  It also means taking a serious look at our selves, to curb selfishness, by recognizing that indeed, there is a ""high cost"" not just to a ""low price"", but also to 'record' profits and 'soaring' markets.",3,"Good Critique of Walmart, but....",1172793600,"03 2, 2007",2007,4813,"['Walmart', 'High', 'Cost', 'Low', 'Price', 'Robert', 'Greenwald', 'well-meaning', 'film', 'pointed', 'criticisms',

The film is littered with the personal stories of individuals, families, and communities adversely effected (exploited, hurt, ruined, et cetura) by Wal-mart; yet is also saturated with hard hitting facts (data, statistics, et cetura) which creates a film that is both personal, emotional and intellectual, abstract.I have been following the criticism of Wal-mart for some time and I was suprised that there were stories and problems revealed in this film that not even I was aware of. Such as the systemic preventable violent crimes that occur in the their parking lots which ONE Wal-mart guard would prevent but which, apparently for Wal-mart, is one near minimum wage too much to pay to save human lives.The only story that I was aware of that was not in the film was one that I read in the Nation which said that Wal-mart had been opening secret life insurance policies out on their employees (oh, I'm sorry, their ""associates"") so that in the event that someone died, Wal-mart could collect on their deaths, not to help financially support the gieving family, but to collect and keep the money all for their selves!The film is made even more powerful by the inclusion of an ""anti narrator,"" the current CEO of Wal-mart, as well as including numerous clips from  Wal-mart commerials (propaganda pieces). After numerous testimonies from persons hurt or exploited by Wal-mart, the scene is ""commented"" on,  or, as Robert describes it, ""deconstructed,"" by the obvious lies of the CEO or the commercials. This juxtoposition reveals an awareness on the part of Wal-mart that these problems exist, but which they want erase by the generous application of heaping mounts of lies and distortions.We all know that Wal-mart is not the only corporation guilty of horrific practices both here and abroad, but, Wal-mart is in market trend setting avant guard, it is known to everyone, it is one of the largest employers in the country, one of the largest exploiters in the world. If we are going to make changes in this country, in how we run our economy, how we treat our workers, and how we form and create our communities, then there is no better organisation to target first than Wal-mart.

Instead, this was a film that pulled at your heartstrings and your raw emotions...showing scenarios of individuals ""wronged"" by Wal Mart.  Here we only see one side of the story.  Don't get me wrong, I think Wal Mart is an evil corporation that is bad for America.  They use unethical and appalling tactics that not only affect communities, their own employees and small business, but more importantly the decaying manufacturing base of the US economy.  This angle was better explored on an episode of PBS's FrontLine.I definitely recommend the FrontLine documentary over this film.

(I say mostly because other viewpoints are presented by others such as environmentalists.)  The story they tell is not a happy one.  News clips and headline facts are also presented as well as interesting images and background music.Wal-Mart executives refused to be interviewed.  To provide Wal-Mart's side of the story, there is mainly archival company footage used.To give the potential viewer a ""feel"" for the content of this documentary, I will reproduce some selected statements etc. from it (these are just the tip of the iceberg):(1)  ""If Wal-Mart's not a monopoly, I don't know what is.""(2)  ""Wal-Mart seems to be going on a rampage through the American economy and nobody's even paying attention.""(3)  ""Anytime a Wal-Mart comes into a town, they knock the values [of the other buildings] down.""(4)  ""[Wal-Mart doesn't] care about what your sacrifice.  It doesn't matter how many people lose their families.  It doesn't matter if the [employees] have good health care.  It doesn't matter, anything, other than the bottom-line profit.""(5)  ""Retail giant Wal-Mart is encouraging its employees to go on welfare instead of paying for employees to have health benefits.""(6)  ""Why is it that a corporation that, in 2003, had an outstanding $240 billion in sales, would not provide a livable wage and affordable health care for their employees?""(7)  ""Wal-Mart costs taxpayers [$1.5 million] to support its employees.""(8)  ""Wal-Mart currently faces law suits in 31 different states for wage and hour abuses, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of workers.""(9)  ""I can say in my history as a river keeper [an official who looks after rivers] that I don't think I've ever encountered a corporation, be it a power company, an oil company [etc.], as unresponsive [to environmental problems] as Wal-Mart.""(10)  ""As the largest company in the world, Wal-Mart sets the standards that other companies are going to follow so, Wal-Mart right now is sucking down standards all across the world...[international] workers have no rights.""(11)  ""In 2004, Wal-Mart employees gave over $5 million to help fellow workers.  The Walton family [founders of Wal-Mart who have millions] gave $6000.This documentary ends in an interesting way with true stories about people trying to keep Wal-Mart out of their neighborhood.Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2005) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has 65 minutes of good extras.In conclusion, this may not be the most balanced documentary but it makes a powerful statement that's an antidote to the propaganda that the Wal-Mart Corporation generates!!(2005;  95 min;  wide screen;  close captioned;  18 scenes)+++++",5,"Challenges the way you think, feel, and...shop!!",1172102400,"02 22, 2007",2007,3345,"['+++++Consider', 'following', 'facts', 'retail', 'giant', '1', 'Small', 'businesses', 'small', 'town', 'USA', 'are', 'put', 'business', 'when', 'town', '2', 'staff', 'are', 'paid', 'low', 'wages', 'vehemently', 'denied', 'representation', 'union', '3', 'Shoppers', 'risk', 'rape', 'robbery', 'store', 'parking', 'lots', '4', 'International', 'suppliers', 'are', 'exploited.These', 'are', 'facts', 'riveting', 'documentary', 'presents', 'retail', 'megalith', 'Wal-Mart', 'company', 'had', 'massive', 'commercial', 'success', 'very', 'high', 'cost', 'individuals', 'communities.Throughout', 'viewer', 'sees', 'hears', 'mostly', 'current', 'former', 'employees', 'associates', 'including', 'several', 'dozen', 'more', 'years', 'company', 'say', 'mostly', 'other', 'viewpoints', 'are', 'presented', 'others', 'such', 'environmentalists', 'story', 'tell', 'not', 'happy', 'one', 'clips', 'headline', 'facts', 'are', 'also', 'presented', 'as', 'well', 'interesting', 'images', 'background', 'music.Wal-Mart', 'executives', 'refused', 'be', 'interviewed', 'provide', 'Wal-Mart', 'side', 'story', 'mainly', 'archival', 'company', 'footage', 'used.To', 'give', 'potential', 'viewer', 'feel', 'content', 'documentary', 'will', 'reproduce', 'selected', 'statements', 'etc', 'are', 'just', 'tip', 'iceberg', '1', 'Wal-Mart', 'not', 'monopoly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', '2', 'Wal-Mart', 'be', 'going', 'rampage', 'American', 'economy', 'nobody', 'even', 'paying', 'attention', '3', 'Wal-Mart', 'town', 'knock', 'values', '[', 'other', 'buildings', ']', 'down', '4', '[', 'Wal-Mart', ""n't"", ']', 'care', 'what', 'sacrifice', ""n't"", 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'lose', 'families', ""n't"", 'matter', '[', 'employees', ']', 'have', 'good', 'health', 'care', ""n't"", 'matter', 'anything', 'other', 'bottom-line', 'profit', '5', 'Retail', 'giant', 'Wal-Mart', 'encouraging', 'employees', 'go', 'welfare', 'instead', 'paying', 'employees', 'have', 'health', 'benefits', '6', 'Why', 'corporation', '2003', 'had', 'outstanding', '240', 'billion', 'sales', 'would', 'not', 'provide', 'livable', 'wage', 'affordable', 'health', 'care', 'employees', '7', 'Wal-Mart', 'costs', 'taxpayers', '[', '1.5', 'million', ']', 'support', 'employees', '8', 'Wal-Mart', 'currently', 'law', 'suits', '31', 'different', 'states', 'wage', 'hour', 'abuses', 'potentially', 'involving', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'workers', '9', 'can', 'say', 'history', 'river', 'keeper', '[', 'official', 'who', 'rivers', ']', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'encountered', 'corporation', 'be', 'power', 'company', 'oil', 'company', '[', 'etc', ']', 'unresponsive', '[', 'environmental', 'problems', ']', 'Wal-Mart', '10', 'largest', 'company', 'world', 'Wal-Mart', 'sets', 'standards', 'other', 'companies', 'are', 'going', 'follow', 'so', 'Wal-Mart', 'right', 'now', 'sucking', 'down', 'standards', 'world', '[', 'international', ']', 'workers', 'have', 'rights', '11', '2004', 'Wal-Mart', 'employees', 'gave', '5', 'million', 'help', 'fellow', 'workers', 'Walton', 'family', '[', 'founders', 'Wal-Mart', 'who', 'have', 'millions', ']', 'gave', '6000.This', 'documentary', 'ends', 'interesting', 'way', 'true', 'stories', 'people', 'trying', 'keep', 'Wal-Mart', 'neighborhood.Finally', 'DVD', 'one', 'released', '2005', 'perfect', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', '65', 'minutes', 'good', 'extras.In', 'conclusion', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'balanced', 'documentary', 'powerful', 'statement', 'antidote', 'propaganda', 'Wal-Mart', 'Corporation', '2005', '95', 'min', 'wide', 'screen', 'close', 'captioned', '18', 'scenes', '+++++']",Walmart: The High Cost of Low Price

935490,A1XOHJLA16DPZT,B000AYNG1G,Steve Koss,"[42, 49]","Everyone knows the story: WalMart waltzes into a small to medium-sized town, promises jobs and better shopping opportunities for everyone, secures tons of tax concessions, opens to great fanfare among local politicians and property developers, and within a year turns the former downtown area into a wasteland of shuttered buildings and ruined family businesses. But how many people know about the following:-- That WalMart managers keep lists of places Associates could go for public assistance. As one employee was told, ""There are lots of programs out there. Use your taxpayers' dollars!"" The movie estimates that it costs American taxpayers over $1.5 billion every year to support WalMart employees.-- That five Walton family members are in the top ten of America's richest people but give less than 1% of their wealth to charity (Bill Gates has given 58%) but over $3.2 million in political contributions in 2004 alone (one guess as to which political party).-- That the moment the first union in a WalMart Canada store was certified, the company closed the store, claiming it was not profitable.-- That the moment the tax abatements expired for their store in Cathedral City, CA, WalMart relocated it two miles away, just beyond the city line.-- That there were over 27 million square feet of abandoned WalMart store space around the U.S.-- That WalMart knew as early as 1994 from internal studies that 80% of their store crime occurred in the parking lots but has done virtually nothing to make their customers safe and, in fact, tried to hide from the courts that they had even done these studies.-- That store managers are taught how to log onto the WalMart system under false ID's in order to change employees' reported hours so that no overtime would be paid, and that WalMart settled a law suit for $50 million for unpaid overtime in Colorado alone, and that WalMart faces similar work hour and overtime law suits in 31 states.As Robert Greenwald's new DVD, WALMART: THE HIGH COST OF LOW PRICE (HCLP) shows in stunningly personal detail, these are just some of the real truths about WalMart, a company that preys on communities and individual lives for the sake of their profits and shareholders. Greenwald's documentary makes it abundantly clear that those shareholders are not likely to be WalMart employees - those individuals can barely afford to feed their families, let alone share in their employer's success through WalMart's stock.Greenwald points out in one of the DVD's special features that he set out originally to build his documentary around the experiences of a single current employee. He found many who would talk to him off camera, but no one who would ""go public"" out of fear. As a result, he opted to tell many smaller stories of past and current employees (including management level people), small business owners whose family businesses were bankrupted by WalMart, community action groups who have fought WalMart, and even a customer who was assaulted in one of WalMart's unprotected parking lots. Not only do these ""little people"" stories give the documentary a human face, they also present a starkly contrasting reality to various segments of ""corporate speak"" from Lee Scott, the company's president.Perhaps the defining moment in WALMART: HCLP comes from the experiences of Edith Arana, a black woman who worked for the company in Oxnard, CA for six years and was repeatedly praised as a future management candidate. When the day came that she asked about her future, she was told there was no place for ""people like her"" in WalMart management. ""What do you mean, people like me?"" she asked. ""Do you mean because I'm a woman, or because I'm black?"" ""Well, two out of two ain't bad,"" was the reply.WALMART: THE HIGH COST OF LOW PRICE tells a story of corporate inhumanity, of blatant disregard for the law, the environment, civil rights, worker's rights, women's rights, and the rights and welfare of its own employees. Critics will argue that Greenwald's story is one-sided, but how else will we hear the side that can't spend millions on advertising, PR, lobbying, and lawyers?

The shutting out of small businesses, the exploitation of workers (here and overseas), the stripping of ""benefits,"" and just the overall competition to make more are explored in this film. Some reviewers complained about the low quality of the film, but they might be used to documentaries with a bigger budget. What this movie lacks in flash they make up with information.I haven't been to Wal-Mart since watching this. And I know it really doesn't make a difference to them.

935493,A19KVHOG0DGM4P,B000AYNG1G,"Tony Hall ""If the movie stinks, just don't go!""","[28, 43]","First let me say that I think Walmart is pure evil and bad for America. That being said, I think this documentary hurts the anti-Walmart position more than it helps. It's such a poorly made movie, you wonder if Greenwald was paid by Walmart to make those against Walmart look like idiotic, left-wing, nutjobs.The first thing that struck me was that Greenwald's editing is horrible. I could have done a more professional job with some cheap software on my laptop. The annoying editing job makes it difficult to watch sometimes.Next, they spend a great deal of time in the movie on H&H; Hardware because they were going out of business. There was lots of dramatic footage and even tears. Come to find out, the owner of the store told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that Walmart had nothing to do with his shop going out of business. He said that his shop went out of business before Walmart even came to town. Couldn't Greenwald at least have found a real business that was being driven under by Walmart?Another terrible part of the movie is when they get some punk teenager with tattoos and piercings that's trying to start a union at the Walmart. Yeah, that's really the face that I want people associating with the union. This guy just comes off as a total idiot and once again hurts the union more than it helps.Then, when they're talking about Walmart's Chinese factories, the footage they got didn't seem to really reflect the terrible conditions of the sweatshops Walmart uses. If Michael Moore had made this movie, you can bet that he'd have gotten some really graphic footage of what these people go through.Finally, probably the worst and most dishonest scene in the whole movie is when they're talking about parking lot crime at Walmart. They actually go through a list of the crimes that have been commited by people in Walmart parking lots and blame Walmart for not having parking lot security. That's rediculous. People have probably been raped and killed in the parking lot of the local mom and pop shop. Besides, how many stores other than the mall, can you think of with parking lot security?Overall, I'd tell you to not show this movie to anyone who is on the fence. If you want to show them something, show them the Frontline documenary.

They tell their workers to get government assistance (Medicaid and food stamps) and don't even give them overtime. As far as overtime, I'm not talking time and a half. I'm talking about hourly wage after 40 hours. Taxpayers contribute around a billion dollars a year that Wal-mart should be paying. They hire illegal workers and lock them in the building. No surveillance cameras in the parking lot. Once you buy their stuff, your safety is your problem.Hard working American business people (more than likely Republicans) are being put out of business. Men and women who want to keep working in their 50s and 60s, who have their own business or franchise is forced into retirement and their hard working children and grandchildren who put their time into the business thinking someday it will be theirs (or just because they love their parents/grandparents) and watch Wal-mart destroy their parents and their future.
