But his tragic 1977 suicide relegated him to obscutiry until the rise of his son's career and our generation became old enough to demand things like this from our childhood.It's as good as I remember, and even better now that I'm old enough to get the jokes and habla muy poquito espanol (speak a little Spanish for the monolingual out there).Prinze as Chico essentially (and subtly) points out the stupidity of prejudice to the boozing bigot Ed Brown, and the triumph of a positive attutude and the human spirit. In fact, as a child, most of the people around me hated Hispanics. As a ten year old watching this show, I figured they couldn't be that bad (says a lot about the influence of television on children).",5,Excellent sampler of a forgotten classic,1177286400,"04 23, 2007",2007,796,"['Freddie', 'Prize', 'show', 'are', 'mostly', 'remembered', '70s', 'children', 'such', 'tragic', '1977', 'suicide', 'relegated', 'obscutiry', 'rise', 'son', 'career', 'generation', 'became', 'old', 'enough', 'demand', 'things', 'childhood.It', 'as', 'good', 'remember', 'even', 'better', 'now', ""'m"", 'old', 'enough', 'get', 'jokes', 'habla', 'muy', 'poquito', 'espanol', 'speak', 'little', 'Spanish', 'monolingual', 'there', '.Prinze', 'Chico', 'essentially', 'subtly', 'out', 'stupidity', 'prejudice', 'boozing', 'bigot', 'Ed', 'Brown', 'triumph', 'positive', 'attutude', 'human', 'spirit', 'fact', 'child', 'most', 'people', 'hated', 'Hispanics', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'watching', 'show', 'figured', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'lot', 'influence', 'television', 'children']",Chico and the Man

918051,AQ01Q3070LT29,B000A0GXGK,James McDonald,"[43, 45]","How wonderful for Warner Bros. Entertainment to finally release a few episodes of ""Chico and the Man"" starring Jack Albertson and Freddie Prinze.I remember seeing the very first episode on September 13, 1974 when I was 11.  The show was funny and when Prinze came on as ""Chico"", I didn't know what to think of him at first, but the man was funny. He had me laughing throughout the program until my stomach hurt.  It became my favorite show and I did not like to miss it. (Darn those boy scout meetings).I also saw the Million Dollar Rip-off (1976-tv) starring Freddie Prize.When the tragic announcement was made on the news that Prinze had shot himself and later passed away, I had a real hard time believing it.  When you are young, you think that when a person goes to the hospital, they will be fine. HOwever, Freddie Prinze left us.After reading, ""The Freddie Prinze Story"" by Maria Pruetzel and John A. Barbour, then I understood why Freddie left us.  The stardom, the pressure, constant traveling, the drugs, he would get lonely, depressed and upset.  That one night with Quaaludes, Valium and a gun, he was upset and even though his friends and his manager tried to help him that night, Freddie wasn't in a good state of mind and had sleeplessness. The gun went off and Dusty found Prinze slumped over in the hallway.  Freddie went through periods of holding his gun not wanting to be without it.NBC tried to keep the tv series going for Jack Albertson's sake by welcoming young Gabriel Melgar to the cast as ""Raul"" and Scatman Crothers and Della Reese was with him.I still continued to watch ""Chico and the Man"" and the last episode I recall was when ""Raul"" went back to Mexico.For many of us, we have not seen Freddie Prinze since his last appearance as ""Chico"" or his clips from ""The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson"".This DVD release of ""Chico and the Man"" is a real treat and a keepsake.The first episode, the test pilot episode aired, September 13, 1974.""If I Were A Rich Man"", (episode 16) aired, January 31, 1975.""Chico and the Van"" (Season 2, episode 6) aired October 17, 1975.""Chico's Cousin Pepe"" (Season 2, episode 19) aired Feb. 11, 1976.""Ed Talks To God"" (Season 3, episode 18) aired March 4, 1977.You will recognize the faces of: Scatman Crothers, King Moody, Rodolfo Hoyos, Sidney Clute, Jerry Fogel, Ralph Manza, Penny Marshall, Issac Ruiz, Cesar Romero, Jose Feliciano, Jeannie Linero, Edward Andrews and Carmen Zapata.Subtitles available in English, Spanish and French.Bring back the laughter again in your living room.",5,"Thanks for the laughter, Freddie.",1134345600,"12 12, 2005",2005,2544,"['How', 'wonderful', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'Entertainment', 'finally', 'release', 'few', 'episodes', 'Chico', 'Man', 'starring', 'Jack', 'Albertson', 'Freddie', 'Prinze.I', 'remember', 'seeing', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'September', '13', '1974', 'when', 'was', '11', 'show', 'was', 'funny', 'when', 'Prinze', 'came', 'Chico', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'first', 'man', 'was', 'funny', 'had', 'laughing', 'program', 'stomach', 'hurt', 'became', 'favorite', 'show', 'did', 'not', 'miss', 'Darn', 'boy', 'scout', 'meetings', '.I', 'also', 'saw', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Rip-off', '1976-tv', 'starring', 'Freddie', 'Prize.When', 'tragic', 'announcement', 'was', 'made', 'news', 'Prinze', 'had', 'shot', 'later', 'passed', 'away', 'had', 'real', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'When', 'are', 'young', 'think', 'when', 'person', 'hospital', 'will', 'be', 'fine', 'HOwever', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'left', 'us.After', 'reading', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Story', 'Maria', 'Pruetzel', 'John', 'A.', 'Barbour', 'then', 'understood', 'why', 'Freddie', 'left', 'stardom', 'pressure', 'constant', 'traveling', 'drugs', 'would', 'get', 'lonely', 'depressed', 'upset', 'one', 'night', 'Quaaludes', 'Valium', 'gun', 'was', 'upset', 'even', 'friends', 'manager', 'tried', 'help', 'night', 'Freddie', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'state', 'mind', 'had', 'sleeplessness', 'gun', 'went', 'Dusty', 'found', 'Prinze', 'slumped', 'hallway', 'Freddie', 'went', 'periods', 'holding', 'gun', 'not', 'wanting', 'be', 'it.NBC', 'tried', 'keep', 'tv', 'series', 'going', 'Jack', 'Albertson', 'sake', 'welcoming', 'young', 'Gabriel', 'Melgar', 'cast', 'Raul', 'Scatman', 'Crothers', 'Della', 'Reese', 'was', 'him.I', 'still', 'continued', 'watch', 'Chico', 'Man', 'last', 'episode', 'recall', 'was', 'when', 'Raul', 'went', 'back', 'Mexico.For', 'many', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'last', 'appearance', 'Chico', 'clips', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'Johnny', 'Carson', '.This', 'DVD', 'release', 'Chico', 'Man', 'real', 'treat', 'keepsake.The', 'first', 'episode', 'test', 'pilot', 'episode', 'aired', 'September', '13', '1974', 'Were', 'Rich', 'Man', 'episode', '16', 'aired', 'January', '31', '1975', 'Chico', 'Van', 'Season', '2', 'episode', '6', 'aired', 'October', '17', '1975', 'Chico', 'Cousin', 'Pepe', 'Season', '2', 'episode', '19', 'aired', 'Feb.', '11', '1976', 'Ed', 'Talks', 'God', 'Season', '3', 'episode', '18', 'aired', 'March', '4', '1977.You', 'will', 'recognize', 'Scatman', 'Crothers', 'King', 'Moody', 'Rodolfo', 'Hoyos', 'Sidney', 'Clute', 'Jerry', 'Fogel', 'Ralph', 'Manza', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'Issac', 'Ruiz', 'Cesar', 'Romero', 'Jose', 'Feliciano', 'Jeannie', 'Linero', 'Edward', 'Andrews', 'Carmen', 'Zapata.Subtitles', 'available', 'English', 'Spanish', 'French.Bring', 'back', 'laughter', 'again', 'living', 'room']",Chico and the Man

918053,ATMNM0IMFHL9,B000A0GXGK,"John T. R. Gorman ""John Lee Booker""","[4, 4]","COME ON, WARNER BROTHERS! There are so many TV sitcoms that have every episode on DVD. Most of these supposedly ""funny"" shows pale in comparison to ""Chico and the Man"", which deserves -- no, demands the full-series DVD treatment, by its unique blend of comedy, heart, and the pure acting brilliance of its' two deceased superstars, Freddie Prinze, Sr. and Jack Albertson. This DVD set of six shows are each wonderfully funny, but when I'd watched all of them I felt much like a starving guy whose food is taken away after a very few bites. I want the whole series. Everyone who remembers the show fondly will buy it, too.Unfamiliar with this show? It ran from 1974-78, and was an instant, big hit. (Search YouTube for it). Prinze, Sr., plays the wisecracking Puerto Rican whiz-kid auto mechanic, Chico Rodriguez. Albertson, whose career began in vaudeville, plays the grouchy owner of Ed Brown's Garage. Ed Brown is a hard-drinking widower, who laments the racial change of his East Los Angeles neighborhood from White to Hispanic at least as much, if not more than, the loss of his wife.Brown's Garage isn't doing much business, because the few customers that come in Ed berates and insults, especially if they're Hispanic. [The character Ed Brown hurls every negative stereotype at such folks as this Whiter-than-White Irish guy has ever heard].Enter Prinze's Chico Rodriguez, who needs a job. He not only pesters Ed for one 'til he gets it, but proves in short order that he's an even better mechanic than Brown, who slowly warms up to this youngster who's just bested him.It's worth noting that when this show began, Prinze, Sr. was barely 20, and Albertson was 67. Yet the comic and actor's timing between them is as masterful as if they'd worked together for decades. The scripts crackle with life, and, as a bonus, each episode on this disc features one of my favorite humorists, Benjamin Sherman, AKA, ""Scatman"" Crothers, [1910-86], as Louie the garbage man. Crothers was an accomplished jazz musician and ""scat"" singer as well, known to have entertained feared Chicagoland gangster Al Capone. [With Al, you had to be good...or else]!As many know, the show was doomed after Freddie Prinze, Sr.'s tragic drug-fueled suicide in 1977. Freddie was making the kind of money which gave him easy access to the two drugs-du-jour, cocaine and Quaaludes. Arrested for driving under the influence of the latter, his wife, Katherine Cochran, divorced him over fears that his increasing use of drugs was endangering their newborn son, Freddie Prinze, Jr. [Star of I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) and its sequel, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998), and his first leading role, the romantic comedy She's All That (1999)].Despondent over his divorce, Freddie Prinze, Sr. left a note stating his intentions, then took his own life at age 22 in January, 1977.Warner Brothers could do Freddie Senior AND Junior no greater honor than to release the entire of ""Chico and The Man"" shows.

Bemis (Ronny Graham) and Della Rogers (Della Reese).
