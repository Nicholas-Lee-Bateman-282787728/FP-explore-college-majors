1312028,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002ZG99CC,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 6]","I'll start this by saying that I have not seen the original film yet (OMG, are you serious) and so my judging of this film has no nostalgia clouding better judgment.  In other words, I don't like this more because of seeing the original, nor have I walked into watching this pre-judging it thanks to being a fan of the original.  As far as I was concerned, this was just another movie.I have a few issues with this film, some of them rather severe, and I will say that while I found it somewhat entertaining and enjoyable (in parts), this was an overall failure in many ways.  Like I said, I have not seen the original, and maybe it fails in the same areas and so this `remake' can blame its predecessor for negative influence, but judging this solely as an individual film I have to say that it just did not work.The film tells the story of young Dre Parker.  We are told in a gimmicky manner that his father dies when he was nine.  He's twelve now.  His mother gets transferred to China (from Detroit, mind you) and so the film opens with Dre and his mother traveling across the world.  Dre is your typical pre-teen kid, and so the move is hard for him, but it doesn't really rear that ugly of a head until he expresses an interest in Meiying.  Soon, young Cheng (an angry child if I ever saw one) begins to bully Dre to the point where Dre fears even remote contact with the boy.  It turns out that Cheng is being trained in Kung-Fu by a brutal teacher and so Cheng feels that mercy is a weakness; thus the relentless beatings he exacts on Dre.  Seeing the torment that Dre is undergoing, a maintenance man named Mr. Han offers to train Dre so that he can fight in a turn tournament.  Obviously, he has his fair share of `wax on wax off' (in this instance it's `put on jacket, take off jacket') but soon Dre starts to learn the discipline and technique needed to beat up other children (yes, I'll get to that in a minute).I don't know how the original ended (although I read a seeming spoiler in one review of this version that leads me to believe it ended far more earnest and realistic than this one) but I must say that I hated this ending.I don't really know where to begin.  I could start with Jaden Smith, but I don't want to sound mean.  I won't say that he is a bad actor, especially since he has a lot of his father's expressions and I think Will Smith is a truly underrated actor.  I also thought that Jaden was the BEST thing about `The Pursuit of Happyness', so it's obvious that he has talent.  I will say this about the pre-teen Smith though; he is far too aware of his celebrity to pull off a natural performance.  He was laced with a constant mugging of the screen that was off-putting and too `put on', as if he was too confident in his ability or at least his stardom to really `act'.  This was stripped away to a degree as the film progressed, but he couldn't quite step away from his own reflection long enough to feel real to me.  Next, the film is far too long for its own good.  It could have edited out a good thirty minutes and still been entertaining, probably even more so.  This is not the type of film that requires a running time of more than two hours; believe me.  Like I said, that ending was terrible.  You build for so long this constant presence of hatred and unreasonable intolerance in a character like Cheng only to strip it away completely in a timespan of three seconds.  It makes no sense and is absolutely pointless, if only to create a faux happy ending for this `kids flick'.Speaking of `kids flick'; this is not.  I'm actually appalled that this film is only rated PG.  It is horrendously violent and mean spirited throughout a lot of the film.  Don't dare label me a prude, because I am far from it, but this film is targeted at young ones and contains countless sequences of pre-teen children beating each other senseless.  I mean, they are beating each other in the face and attempting to break each other limbs.  If the film starred Jet Li it would be rated R.  The character of Cheng is particularly repulsive, but his teacher is even worse (when he instructs Cheng to break Dre's leg I was flabbergasted that this film existed).Uck, but at least Jackie Chan finally proves that he can act (wow, best performance of his career) and Taraji P. Henson is seriously the light of my life; so there's that.  Honestly, they should have scrapped this whole project and just cast Henson as a young widow traveling to China to find herself only to fall in love with a reclusive maintenance man who has a troubled past and a tendency to destroy newly remodeled vehicles.I'd watch that before watching this again.",2,A kick in the ribs...,1314835200,"09 1, 2011",2011,4655,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'saying', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'film', 'yet', 'OMG', 'are', 'serious', 'so', 'judging', 'film', 'nostalgia', 'clouding', 'better', 'judgment', 'other', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'more', 'seeing', 'original', 'have', 'walked', 'watching', 'pre-judging', 'being', 'fan', 'original', 'As', 'far', 'was', 'concerned', 'was', 'just', 'movie.I', 'have', 'few', 'issues', 'film', 'rather', 'severe', 'will', 'say', 'found', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'parts', 'was', 'overall', 'failure', 'many', 'ways', 'said', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'maybe', 'same', 'areas', 'so', 'remake', 'can', 'blame', 'predecessor', 'negative', 'influence', 'judging', 'solely', 'individual', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'work.The', 'film', 'story', 'young', 'Dre', 'Parker', 'are', 'told', 'gimmicky', 'manner', 'father', 'when', 'was', 'nine', 'twelve', 'now', 'mother', 'transferred', 'China', 'Detroit', 'so', 'film', 'Dre', 'mother', 'traveling', 'world', 'Dre', 'typical', 'pre-teen', 'kid', 'so', 'move', 'hard', ""n't"", 'really', 'rear', 'ugly', 'head', 'interest', 'Meiying', 'Soon', 'young', 'Cheng', 'angry', 'child', 'ever', 'saw', 'one', 'bully', 'Dre', 'point', 'where', 'Dre', 'even', 'remote', 'contact', 'boy', 'out', 'Cheng', 'being', 'trained', 'Kung-Fu', 'brutal', 'teacher', 'so', 'Cheng', 'feels', 'mercy', 'weakness', 'thus', 'relentless', 'beatings', 'Dre', 'Seeing', 'torment', 'Dre', 'undergoing', 'maintenance', 'man', 'named', 'Mr.', 'Han', 'train', 'Dre', 'so', 'can', 'fight', 'turn', 'tournament', 'Obviously', 'fair', 'share', 'wax', 'wax', 'instance', 'put', 'jacket', 'take', 'off', 'jacket', 'soon', 'Dre', 'learn', 'discipline', 'technique', 'needed', 'beat', 'up', 'other', 'children', 'yes', ""'ll"", 'get', 'minute', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'original', 'ended', 'read', 'seeming', 'spoiler', 'one', 'review', 'version', 'believe', 'ended', 'far', 'more', 'earnest', 'realistic', 'one', 'must', 'say', 'hated', 'ending.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'could', 'start', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'sound', 'mean', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'bad', 'actor', 'especially', 'lot', 'father', 'expressions', 'think', 'Will', 'Smith', 'truly', 'underrated', 'actor', 'also', 'thought', 'Jaden', 'was', 'BEST', 'thing', 'Pursuit', 'Happyness', 'obvious', 'talent', 'will', 'say', 'pre-teen', 'Smith', 'though', 'far', 'too', 'aware', 'celebrity', 'pull', 'off', 'natural', 'performance', 'was', 'laced', 'constant', 'mugging', 'screen', 'was', 'off-putting', 'too', 'put', 'was', 'too', 'confident', 'ability', 'least', 'stardom', 'really', 'act', 'was', 'stripped', 'away', 'degree', 'film', 'progressed', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'step', 'away', 'own', 'reflection', 'long', 'enough', 'feel', 'real', 'Next', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'own', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'edited', 'out', 'good', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'still', 'been', 'entertaining', 'probably', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'not', 'type', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'more', 'two', 'hours', 'believe', 'said', 'ending', 'was', 'terrible', 'build', 'so', 'long', 'constant', 'presence', 'hatred', 'unreasonable', 'intolerance', 'character', 'Cheng', 'only', 'strip', 'away', 'completely', 'timespan', 'three', 'seconds', 'sense', 'absolutely', 'pointless', 'only', 'create', 'faux', 'happy', 'ending', 'kids', ""flick'.Speaking"", 'kids', 'flick', 'not', ""'m"", 'actually', 'appalled', 'film', 'only', 'rated', 'PG', 'horrendously', 'violent', 'mean', 'spirited', 'lot', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'dare', 'label', 'prude', 'am', 'far', 'film', 'targeted', 'young', 'ones', 'contains', 'countless', 'sequences', 'pre-teen', 'children', 'beating', 'other', 'senseless', 'mean', 'are', 'beating', 'other', 'face', 'attempting', 'break', 'other', 'limbs', 'film', 'starred', 'Jet', 'Li', 'would', 'be', 'rated', 'R.', 'character', 'Cheng', 'particularly', 'repulsive', 'teacher', 'even', 'worse', 'when', 'Cheng', 'break', 'Dre', 'leg', 'was', 'flabbergasted', 'film', 'existed', '.Uck', 'least', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'finally', 'can', 'act', 'wow', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'Taraji', 'P.', 'Henson', 'seriously', 'light', 'life', 'Honestly', 'should', 'have', 'scrapped', 'whole', 'project', 'just', 'cast', 'Henson', 'young', 'widow', 'traveling', 'China', 'find', 'only', 'fall', 'love', 'reclusive', 'maintenance', 'man', 'who', 'troubled', 'past', 'tendency', 'destroy', 'newly', 'remodeled', 'vehicles.I', ""'d"", 'watch', 'before', 'watching', 'again']",N/A

It kept the heart of the original movie while creating its own legacy.  Both Daniel LaRusso and Dre Parker are suddenly thrust into a world that is completely foreign to them (Daniel, a new transplant to California living, comes to realize how far from paradise this place really is, as he has to contend with trying to fit in, making new friends, and avoiding the school bullies; while Dre, who really is in a foreign country--China--has these same issues to contend with).  Both mothers are widowed and are trying to make the best of their situations with their only sons (which could be why they both seem oblivious to the pain and anguish their children are going through).Help comes for both of them in the form of mentors/sages Mr. Miyagi (for Daniel) and Mr. Han (for Dre), who teach them the true meaning of manhood and courage.  The differences are obvious:  age (Daniel is 15 going on 16 when we meet him; Dre is twelve years old), race (Daniel is Italian, Dre is African-American), and time period (Daniel lives in a simpler time of go-carts and video games, while Dre is a child of the new millennium).  However, the experience of a first love/crush, the wanting to be accepted by your peers, and the need for guidance is universal and rings true in both stories, as well as the loving but sometimes frustrating relationships between parents and adolescent children.I have to admit that I was one of those skeptics who vowed it could never be done, but in this instance, I'm glad I was wrong.",5,I loved the remake....,1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,1580,"['Take', 'notes', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'remake', 'THIS', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'kept', 'heart', 'original', 'movie', 'creating', 'own', 'legacy', 'Daniel', 'LaRusso', 'Dre', 'Parker', 'are', 'suddenly', 'thrust', 'world', 'completely', 'foreign', 'Daniel', 'new', 'transplant', 'California', 'living', 'realize', 'how', 'far', 'paradise', 'place', 'really', 'contend', 'trying', 'fit', 'making', 'new', 'friends', 'avoiding', 'school', 'bullies', 'Dre', 'who', 'really', 'foreign', 'country', 'China', 'same', 'issues', 'contend', 'mothers', 'are', 'widowed', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'best', 'situations', 'only', 'sons', 'could', 'be', 'why', 'seem', 'oblivious', 'pain', 'anguish', 'children', 'are', 'going', '.Help', 'form', 'mentors/sages', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'Daniel', 'Mr.', 'Han', 'Dre', 'who', 'teach', 'true', 'meaning', 'manhood', 'courage', 'differences', 'are', 'obvious', 'age', 'Daniel', '15', 'going', '16', 'when', 'meet', 'Dre', 'twelve', 'years', 'old', 'race', 'Daniel', 'Italian', 'Dre', 'African-American', 'time', 'period', 'Daniel', 'simpler', 'time', 'go-carts', 'video', 'games', 'Dre', 'child', 'new', 'millennium', 'However', 'experience', 'first', 'love/crush', 'wanting', 'be', 'accepted', 'peers', 'need', 'guidance', 'universal', 'rings', 'true', 'stories', 'as', 'well', 'loving', 'sometimes', 'frustrating', 'relationships', 'parents', 'adolescent', 'children.I', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'one', 'skeptics', 'who', 'vowed', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'done', 'instance', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', 'wrong']",N/A

1312035,A1DZU4AQR7KD9R,B002ZG99CC,"Axton Blessendon, Jr.","[2, 7]","""The Karate Kid"" (2010)----------------------------------This is a pretty good remake of the 1984 sports classic, ""The Karate Kid,"" featuring action hero Jackie Chan playing the part of martial arts instructor Mr. Han, and Will Smith's son, Jaden, in the Ralph Macchio hero role. There are some interesting aspects to this modernized version, not the least is a glimpse at life in modern-day China, a world where shiny new skyscrapers, traffic jams and high-tech gadgets coexist with run-down slums and a tenacious Confucian social culture.The film has some liabilities -- the Mr. Han character is so dour and understated that little of Jackie Chan's puckish humor comes through; also, Jaden Smith's eternal poutiness may get on your nerves after a while. My main problem, having taken a young (six-year old) child to see it in the theater, is that the violence in the movie's first half (when we meet the bullies that Smith must confront) is quite brutal. My kid had never been exposed to that level of graphic violence and it was a bit of a shock. It's my fault for not properly vetting the film, but maybe other overprotectivoid parents can benefit from my experience. This flick is probably best for kids in their 'tweens and above; not sure how appropriate it is for littler children. Still, I enjoyed the film, and the messages about the proper use of martial arts training (for self-defense and as a form of spiritual improvement) come through clearly and are quite welcome.

1312037,A2582KMXLK2P06,B002ZG99CC,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","I actually prefer this updated version of the Karate Kid over the original one by far.  Perhaps my reasoning is because the movie was due for an update to break away from the typical 80's cheese and outdatedness.It's about a boy and his mother who travel to China to start a new life, and the litle boy soon realizes that, in addition to not liking his stay in China very much, he doesn't like the fact his classmates are constantly picking on him.  In fact, ""picking on him"" is sort of a compliment compared to all that outside physical abuse on the playground he had to endure just by simply walking over to an attractive girl and talking with her about music.  Wow was THAT ever a rough day!Anyway, as you can probably guess (even if you've never seen the original version, you can guess what happens) the little boy eventually meets Jackie Chan, a martial arts master.  He of course, teaches the young boy discipline and victory by way of his own techniques.Now what I really like about this particular version of the movie is how a proper amount of time was devoted to every little area that makes these kind of films so much fun to watch in the first place.You had quite a bit of emotional drama in the beginning while the boy was walking around the streets of China getting to know people, you had humor in some of the pranks the little boy would pull on his classmates (along with those lengthy and overdone jacket scenes.  Yeah, THESE segments certainly weren't necessary because they received too much attention- minor complaint here folks) and you even felt anger whenever the little boy was being ganged up on.  The feeling of hopelessness you had when the boy was outnumbered during that one back alley scene for example, made you angry I bet.  It should have, at least- that's a sign of good writing and storytelling.I guess the only thing that was rushed were the actual segments where Jackie Chan's hard work and constant training *finally* kicked in and made sense to the boy.  These segments were surprisingly short and didn't occur until a good hour and 40 minutes went by, though I believe I know why- the film writers probably thought we've seen enough training segments over the years (especially back in the 70's and 80's- remember all those Rocky films?) so they probably felt it was better to not really touch upon them very often. Good move.The boy who portrayed the bully was really mean and did a great job in his performance.Overall, I'm really happy with the Karate Kid.  It does everything right.

I watched the movie for over an hour to see if anything exciting happens...NOPE! First off...The kid is a carbon copy of his dad, which is not a good sign, because his dad can actually do some damage on screen. However, carbon copy? It's obvious why he was cast by seeing the producers credits (Dad AND Mom signed up!). I once received a free Taco Bell pass to go see it, and I decided to skip it just for the reason that it is so racist for an african american kid to be in CHINA and call it the Karate Kid. The original had a white kid in the U.S. and they called it that because the teacher knew Karate because he was from JAPAN. As I watched the rental, I turned it off not really knowing what happens at the end, because I simply didn't give a poo. I thought for a second that Jackie was going to teach him Karate in China, which seems odd, but in my mind it would still make sense because of the TITLE.

1312044,ALC3LG8YTNHU3,B002ZG99CC,"Bruce Barker ""Risingsnow""","[8, 12]","I'm a huge Jackie Chan fan. I've been buying his movies for decades and have read his autobiography ""I Am Jackie Chan"" multiple times. As he ages it is only inevitable that he slow down and establish himself as an actor instead of merely a martial arts wonder. In China, this is not a problem for him, but in American films he has relied on his sense of humor to carry him as he struggles with mastering the nuances of English.In ""The Karate Kid,"" it is evident that his efforts have paid off. His performance is far more textured than in any of his previous American work and he steps up as a worthy successor to Pat Morita. Young Jaden Smith is also growing into his acting chops and although his performance is somewhat uneven, he handles his role well enough that it's easy to believe he is headed for a solid acting career even without the presence of his superstar father and talented mother.What follows may contain spoilers, so do not proceed unless you have either already seen the film or don't mind knowing plot devices in advance.The two leads are not the problem with this film. Where things come somewhat off the rails is in the script and directing. Most of the audience for this movie is already very familiar with the plot. As a result, the script is sloppy. Instead of building the relationships between the ""events"" of the story, the script settles for throwing people together in an entirely predictable manner. Also, everything is just too convenient and implausible. When the youngster arrives in China there is an instant American friend just waiting for him. Within moments this stranger is helping carry luggage and showing Jaden the ropes. The character development of the entire movie is glossed over in this sort of ""convenient"" manner.In the final tournament, there are multiple moments that would simply not be allowed in an actual martial arts tourney. Fighters get knocked out of the circle and simply walk back in and resume fighting without warning. The sole exception of course, is Jaden's character. He gets warned in the very first match, which makes the repeatedly ignored infractions that occur as the tournament continues all the more obvious. In addition, illegal wrestling and mixed martial arts moves are not only allowed, but are awarded points instead of warnings. Anyone that has participated in, or attended one of these events at a local dojo will quickly see the liberties the director takes to make the action sequences all the more exciting. In essence, the film repeatedly sacrifices accuracy for visual flair.The supporting cast does a very nice job although the mother in the film is given little to do but whine, cheer, and overact. In fact, when her son places the trophy in front of her at the end of the film, she is too busy ogling the thing to show a hint of concern for her child, who can't put weight on his leg and can barely stand because of the agony of his injuries. No mother on earth would behave in this manner and it's just the last of a long list of cases where the script and direction let this movie down.I'm giving this movie 3 stars on the Amazon scale because of the performances of the two male leads. Also, although they pay some homage to the parlor trick method of teaching kung fu (wax on - wax off... jacket on, jacket off, etc) there are lengthy montages showcasing just how hard the character has to work to learn the art itself.Overall this is a decent movie to watch if you're looking to kill a rainy evening. As long as you don't set the bar too high, there is a lot of fun to be had.Special features on the DVD are also a bit of a disappointment. I Think this is the first Jackie Chan movie I've ever watched that did not feature a ""don't try this at home"" reel for example. There are no outtakes or bloopers either. There are some previews (including a gratuitous trailer for Hancock so daddy can try to move some of the unsold inventory) and a short ""making of"" featurette. Other than a music video, you're pretty much out of luck.It's sad to watch Jackie Chan slowing down. But it's a joy to see him becoming just as competent a leading man in an English speaking role as he is speaking in his native tongue. This is a decent movie that should have been a whole lot better.",3,"Well intentioned, but badly flawed remake.",1287014400,"10 14, 2010",2010,4264,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'been', 'buying', 'movies', 'decades', 'have', 'read', 'autobiography', 'Am', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'multiple', 'times', 'only', 'inevitable', 'slow', 'down', 'establish', 'actor', 'instead', 'merely', 'martial', 'arts', 'wonder', 'China', 'not', 'problem', 'American', 'films', 'relied', 'sense', 'humor', 'carry', 'mastering', 'nuances', 'English.In', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'evident', 'efforts', 'have', 'paid', 'off', 'performance', 'far', 'more', 'textured', 'previous', 'American', 'work', 'up', 'worthy', 'successor', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'Young', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'also', 'growing', 'acting', 'chops', 'performance', 'somewhat', 'uneven', 'role', 'well', 'enough', 'easy', 'believe', 'headed', 'solid', 'acting', 'career', 'even', 'presence', 'superstar', 'father', 'talented', 'mother.What', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'proceed', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'knowing', 'plot', 'devices', 'advance.The', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'not', 'problem', 'film', 'Where', 'things', 'come', 'somewhat', 'rails', 'script', 'directing', 'Most', 'audience', 'movie', 'already', 'very', 'familiar', 'plot', 'result', 'script', 'sloppy', 'Instead', 'building', 'relationships', 'events', 'story', 'script', 'throwing', 'people', 'together', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'manner', 'Also', 'everything', 'just', 'too', 'convenient', 'implausible', 'When', 'youngster', 'China', 'instant', 'American', 'friend', 'just', 'waiting', 'moments', 'stranger', 'helping', 'carry', 'luggage', 'showing', 'Jaden', 'ropes', 'character', 'development', 'entire', 'movie', 'glossed', 'sort', 'convenient', 'final', 'tournament', 'are', 'multiple', 'moments', 'would', 'simply', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'actual', 'martial', 'arts', 'tourney', 'Fighters', 'get', 'knocked', 'circle', 'simply', 'walk', 'back', 'resume', 'fighting', 'warning', 'sole', 'exception', 'course', 'Jaden', 'character', 'warned', 'very', 'first', 'match', 'repeatedly', 'ignored', 'infractions', 'occur', 'tournament', 'more', 'obvious', 'addition', 'illegal', 'wrestling', 'mixed', 'martial', 'arts', 'moves', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'allowed', 'are', 'awarded', 'points', 'instead', 'warnings', 'Anyone', 'participated', 'attended', 'one', 'events', 'local', 'dojo', 'will', 'quickly', 'see', 'liberties', 'director', 'make', 'action', 'more', 'exciting', 'essence', 'film', 'repeatedly', 'accuracy', 'visual', 'flair.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'very', 'nice', 'job', 'mother', 'film', 'given', 'little', 'do', 'whine', 'cheer', 'overact', 'fact', 'when', 'son', 'trophy', 'front', 'end', 'film', 'too', 'busy', 'ogling', 'thing', 'show', 'hint', 'concern', 'child', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'weight', 'leg', 'can', 'barely', 'stand', 'agony', 'injuries', 'mother', 'earth', 'would', 'behave', 'manner', 'just', 'last', 'long', 'list', 'cases', 'where', 'script', 'direction', 'let', 'movie', ""'m"", 'giving', 'movie', '3', 'stars', 'Amazon', 'scale', 'performances', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'Also', 'pay', 'homage', 'parlor', 'trick', 'method', 'teaching', 'kung', 'fu', 'wax', 'wax', 'jacket', 'jacket', 'off', 'etc', 'are', 'lengthy', 'montages', 'showcasing', 'just', 'how', 'hard', 'character', 'work', 'learn', 'art', 'itself.Overall', 'decent', 'movie', 'watch', ""'re"", 'looking', 'kill', 'rainy', 'evening', 'As', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'set', 'bar', 'too', 'high', 'lot', 'fun', 'be', 'had.Special', 'features', 'DVD', 'are', 'also', 'bit', 'disappointment', 'Think', 'first', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'did', 'not', 'feature', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'home', 'reel', 'example', 'are', 'outtakes', 'bloopers', 'either', 'are', 'previews', 'including', 'gratuitous', 'trailer', 'Hancock', 'so', 'daddy', 'can', 'try', 'move', 'unsold', 'inventory', 'short', 'making', 'featurette', 'Other', 'music', 'video', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'much', 'luck.It', 'sad', 'watch', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'slowing', 'down', 'joy', 'see', 'becoming', 'just', 'competent', 'leading', 'man', 'English', 'speaking', 'role', 'speaking', 'native', 'tongue', 'decent', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'whole', 'lot', 'better']",N/A
1312045,A3QNQQKJTL76H0,B002ZG99CC,buru buru piggu,"[2, 6]","The Karate Kid (2010) is a remake of the 1984 Ralph Macchio/Pat Morita classic. For some reason (probably marketing-related), the producers decided to keep the name ""Karate Kid"" instead of altering it to the more appropriate ""Kung Fu Kid"", a name fans have been calling it on the interwebs. For martial arts purists, ""The Karate Kid"" is inaccurate, because this movie is about kung fu, not karate. In China, this film is presented under the more accurate name ""Kung Fu Dream"". To avoid confusion, I will refer to this version as ""Kung Fu Kid"" in this review.The Karate Kid was made during the 80's, at the height of Japan's economic dominance. With China's rapidly growing influence and prominence in world affairs, it is only natural that more and more films these days are about China. Though the names and places are changed, the film sticks very closely to the original Karate Kid story arc. This is both good and bad. Fans of the original will be pleased that the 2010 version is so faithful in spirit and tone to the source material. But because of this, we get very few surprises with the main story progression. If you've seen the 1984 Karate Kid, you'll know how this film ends. However, I did not mind this at all. I enjoyed Kung Fu Kid tremendously and found all the changes and similarities refreshing after having seen so many awful attempts at ""East meets West"" kung fu films and bad remakes. This is a heartwarming family-friendly movie about love and friendship that seems to have been done with loving care and devotion on all sides. It also provides us a rare glimpse into daily Chinese urban life that, outside of films made by Chinese filmmakers, Americans rarely get to see. Much of the film is shot in cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute; style. If you don't like the shaky camera look, you might be annoyed.Story: Again, we have a single mom raising a boy. She moves a great distance in search of better job opportunities. Here, instead of moving from Raseda, NJ to LA, it's a bigger leap from Detroit to Beijing. In the original, Daniel is a high-schooler. Here, he is Dre, a middle school student (played by 12 year old Jaden Smith). The change is important. Maybe it's to market the film better to younger audiences, but it introduces a new dynamic to the film and changes the story quite a lot. He is still terrorized by bullies, but a 12-year old's problems and concerns are a lot different than a 16 year old's. Jackie Chan plays the part of Dre's teacher perfectly, Mr. Han. He is friend, surrogate father, and teacher, just as Mr. Miyagi was. Again, we have a man grieving from a deep personal tragedy and profound loss. I found that this was handled very well in the story and the change in details perfectly incorporated into the story.All the iconic Karate Kid moments are here, including the famous chopstick fly-catching bit. I won't spoil the surprise, but you'll laugh when you see it. We are also treated to a fantastic fight scene between Mr. Han and the bullies, showcasing Jackie Chan's signature comical kung fu choreography. As mentioned earlier, we get to see a part of Chinese life that is rare to see in American-made films. We see some fantastically intimate scenes of daily Chinese life and schooling in Beijing, a city that is both ancient and super modern at the same time. In the background of the famed Beijing Aquatic Center (Watercube) and Olympic Stadium (Bird's Nest), we have centuries-old traditional Chinese houses. We also see some of China's magnificent natural landscape as well as visit a Buddhist monastery where monks practice kung fu. The style of kung fu and philosophy show in the film is taichi chuan. This is never explicitly spoken, though the numerous depictions of the taichi symbol (yin-yang) appear throughout the film.The finale is all flash and rock n' roll, complete with an AC/DC and Red Hot Chili Peppers soundtrack, animated scoreboard graphics, fast cuts, and outrageously impossible kung fu/pro-wrestling moves for 13 year olds, like somersaults, leg lariats, and backflip kicks. This aspect of the movie I objected to. The producers just turned the ending into a video game. One kid even has hair like (Street Fighter IV Action Figure Guile) and does a pre-fight touchup of his coif.To sum up, I was worried about this remake, but after having seen it, my fears were misplaced. The film is very enjoyable and wholesome and it is clear that the filmmakers have a lot of respect for the source material, the acting, as well the art of kung fu. There are many small changes made to bring this story into China and the 21st Century, but all of them done very well and naturally. It is an homage to the original and stands up as its own film. Highly recommended.",5,An excellent remake of the 80's classic,1281830400,"08 15, 2010",2010,4740,"['Karate', 'Kid', '2010', 'remake', '1984', 'Ralph', 'Macchio/Pat', 'Morita', 'classic', 'reason',

1312046,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B002ZG99CC,Caleb Williams,"[14, 20]","Having not seen the original Karate Kid for many years, the content, story and overall feel of the original is simply lost in the annals of time as a result of my terrible memory. So with that, I'll say that my review will be written as if the original Karate Kid movie had never been made and this was an entirely original piece. For me to try and make a comparison would create a review based on false ideas and comparisons, which is not what I want my reviews to be.The film came as a surprise as Jackie Chan took on a role which I am totally unfamiliar with him playing, and that is the serious role of a man who is deeply traumatised by his past, and looking for something to make his life better. Jaden Smith, son of the fantastic Will Smith, is a young actor I wasn't entirely impressed by with his role in the remake of ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"", but also surprised me in his role as Dre Parker.The film focuses around 12 year old Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) and his Mom who move to China to start life anew. Struggling to settle in, Dre encounters maintenance man, Mr. Han (Jackie Chan, and also an entirely unintentional rhyme) who saves Dre from a beating by a gang of Kung Fu bullies. There's nothing more dangerous than a Kung Fu bully I'll have you know. After saving Dre, Mr. Han agrees to help train Dre in the art of Kung Fu to prepare him for a tournament which will get rid of the bullies once and for all.The false advertisement of calling it ""The Karate Kid"" aside, this is actually a really good film. They acknowledge that it is not Karate but Kung Fu that Dre is learning, but whatever the martial art, it is still done really well. The setting of China couldn't have been more perfect for a number of different reasons. The fish-out-of-water plot, the cultural and scenic perspective the film is told from works perfectly and allows the plot and its characters to truly flourish.Jaden Smith, from a family of acting royalty couldn't have been more perfect for the role. He's clearly a kid who feels comfortable in front of a camera and has a bright future ahead of him; some of the beatings he received from the bullies in the film were a bit too harsh to be comfortable viewing considering he's a 12 year old, but he's a very good actor all the same. Chan performed well as the quiet, tormented and mysterious Mr. Han and this is without a doubt a great stepping stone to a more serious career for Jackie Chan.Overall, the film was great. It dragged at times and I didn't really feel the chemistry between Smith & Chan, although they performed well individually. The Chinese setting presented some breathtaking shots and managed to portray Dre's awkwardness starting a fresh life really well. The supporting cast, including Dre's love interest, were a simple tag on to the main plot and help you become more emotionally invested in the young life of Dre Parker.",4,"Karate Kid - Putting the original aside, how does this work?",1284163200,"09 11, 2010",2010,2890,"['Having', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'many', 'years', 'content', 'story', 'overall', 'feel', 'original', 'simply', 'lost', 'annals', 'time', 'result', 'terrible', 'memory', 'So', ""'ll"", 'say', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'written', 'original', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'movie', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'made', 'was', 'entirely', 'original', 'piece', 'try', 'make', 'comparison', 'would', 'create', 'review', 'based', 'false', 'ideas', 'comparisons', 'not', 'what', 'want', 'reviews', 'be.The', 'film', 'came', 'surprise', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'took', 'role', 'am', 'totally', 'unfamiliar', 'playing', 'serious', 'role', 'man', 'who', 'deeply', 'traumatised', 'past', 'looking', 'something', 'make', 'life', 'better', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'son', 'fantastic', 'Will', 'Smith', 'young', 'actor', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'impressed', 'role', 'remake', 'Day', 'Earth', 'Stood', 'Still', 'also', 'surprised', 'role', 'Dre', 'Parker.The', 'film', '12', 'year', 'old', 'Dre', 'Parker', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'Mom', 'who', 'move', 'China', 'start', 'life', 'anew', 'Struggling', 'settle', 'Dre', 'maintenance', 'man', 'Mr.', 'Han', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'also', 'entirely', 'unintentional', 'rhyme', 'who', 'Dre', 'beating', 'gang', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'bullies', 'nothing', 'more', 'dangerous', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'bully', ""'ll"", 'have', 'know', 'saving', 'Dre', 'Mr.', 'Han', 'help', 'train', 'Dre', 'art', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'prepare', 'tournament', 'will', 'get', 'rid', 'bullies', 'once', 'all.The', 'false', 'advertisement', 'calling', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'aside', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'acknowledge', 'not', 'Karate', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Dre', 'learning', 'whatever', 'martial', 'art', 'still', 'done', 'really', 'well', 'setting', 'China', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'perfect', 'number', 'different', 'reasons', 'fish-out-of-water', 'plot', 'cultural', 'scenic', 'perspective', 'film', 'told', 'works', 'perfectly', 'plot', 'characters', 'truly', 'flourish.Jaden', 'Smith', 'family', 'acting', 'royalty', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'perfect', 'role', 'clearly', 'kid', 'who', 'comfortable', 'front', 'camera', 'bright', 'future', 'ahead', 'beatings', 'received', 'bullies', 'film', 'were', 'bit', 'too', 'harsh', 'be', 'comfortable', 'viewing', 'considering', '12', 'year', 'old', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'same', 'Chan', 'performed', 'well', 'quiet', 'tormented', 'mysterious', 'Mr.', 'Han', 'doubt', 'great', 'stepping', 'stone', 'more', 'serious', 'career', 'Jackie', 'Chan.Overall', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'dragged', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'chemistry', 'Smith', 'Chan', 'performed', 'well', 'individually', 'Chinese', 'setting', 'presented', 'breathtaking', 'shots', 'managed', 'portray', 'Dre', 'awkwardness', 'starting', 'fresh', 'life', 'really', 'well', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Dre', 'love', 'interest', 'were', 'simple', 'tag', 'main', 'plot', 'help', 'become', 'more', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'young', 'life', 'Dre', 'Parker']",N/A

It also has a very cute puppy-dog romance with a lovely Chinese girl who can dance like Spice Girls and perform like Sarah Chang.  The menacing bully pulls a perfectly intimidating kung-fu performance and Mr Jackie Chan delivered a dramatic but still a comedic performance, while creating a sweet bond with the little Smith.One element that completely exceeded my expectations was Jaden Smith.  He is a force to be reckoned with.  His parents will be credited for this but the truth is, you can have the most genius of parents or the most talented but if you don't possess the determination or talent to carry it through for yourself, it would not make a difference.  This little Smith is equal to the senior Smith in talent and determination.  To think of the training he must have had to master all the amazing kung fu kicks and choreography is mind-blowing.  At the end of the training sequence in the movie, Jaden shows off his little six-pack and lean, kung-fu trained arms and I thought to myself, 'Kid, you are every bit deserving of that, aren't you?'  The Kung Fu skills is not the only art junior Smith mastered.  He was in almost every scene of the movie and his performance packed charisma and charm.

Well, I really liked the first movie.  I liked Ralph Macchio and especially liked Pat Morita in the original movie.  ""Wax on, wax off"".  The movie had some truly great memorable quotes and scenes.So I wasn't especially enthused about a remake of this old favorite of mine.  Remakes tend not to shine.  But I am very glad I bought this DVD.  I like the new ""Karate Kid"" as much, and maybe even more than, the 80's version.Jaden Smith definitely takes after his parents in the talent department.  Engaging, charismatic, athletic and a great actor.  I will look forward to seeing his talents on display in future movies.I have always loved Jackie Chan - and, in fact, his being in this movie is why I gave it a first viewing.  He can do drama, pathos, slapstick, action.Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith co-produced this movie.  Stellar job.The scenery was GORGEOUS - China in all its glory!  The Great Wall of China; the Forbidden City; the Bird's Nest; the monastery in the Wudang Mountains; the uncomparable karst hills of Guilin; and just the every day scenes throughout the movie.The story was formulaic but that was alright because it was done well.

1312053,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B002ZG99CC,Chris Kennison,"[1, 6]","Karate Kid was a touch-n-go experience for me. There were times when the movie was great and there were times where the movie didn't live up. There were times when I enjoyed the beauty of China and the quality of the film, and there were times when I wish they wouldn't have duplicated the original Karate Kid's script so much.There's is much to say about the new version of Karate Kid with Jackie Chan & Jaden Smith instead of Pat Morita & Ralph Macchio, and I'll try to cover it all in a short amount of time. First of all, taking the movie to China was a brilliant move. The culture in China was well captured and was, in my opinion, the 2nd best part of the film. Yet, the creators decided to stick to the original screenplay and many times to its own fault. In the original Karate Kid, Daniel was moved to California. Not such a big culture move. Most of his adapting to a new place was entirely a friend problem. In the new Karate Kid, Dre is moved from the States to CHINA. A huge culture move, yet since the creators decided to stick to the original script... we lose A LOT of the dilemma and overwhelmingness of a kid trying to make it in a place where he doesn't know the language & has to make friends.The decision of the creators to stick to the original screenplay was at times a disaster and at times, okay. It was never great. It was the few times where they used their creative liberties that took the film to better places. Like when Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) takes him to the top of the mountain to learn about true Kung Fu, or the festival where Dre steals his first kiss with Meiying.The best part of the film was the Karate. First of all, Jackie Chan is of course phenominal. He's a REAL karate artist, so that gave a legitamacy to the film that it possibly didn't deserve. Yet, Jaden Smith did very well himself and that made his scenes very believable. Of course, Chan's scene when he has to fight six of the teenagers who are ganging up on Dre, just like in the first film, was over the top awesome.There are many times when I found myself choked up and was leaning toward really really enjoying the film and giving it 4 stars until the final scene. The final scene is of course when The Karate Kid, Dre, in this case, makes his way through the ranks and does Mr. Han proud. Yet, the tournament seemed to go much faster in the new version, taking away from its realism as to how he made it to the finals. Also, the director decided to use an unsteady cam that shakes and zooms and twists while they fight, destroying the realism of the fights and sucking all the fun out of it. Finally, Dre's scene in the locker room while he pleads for Mr. Han to heal his leg so he can fight, didn't hold a candle to Morita/Macchio's scene. It was empty and had zero impact. Finally, the crane kick... is gone... in its place... quite simply.... something silly.Had the tournament had the same impact that the original had on people's hearts as they watched it, I probably would have given 4 stars. Then again. I knew what was coming. It was the same script as before. I wasn't surprised. My 9-year old daughter said as we left the theatre, ""My heart was racing Dad."" So, for all I know, maybe the knew version will have a new impact on young kids of today as it did when I was a kid. Yet, I'm writing this review, and that's my 2 cents.",3,ASIAN CULTURE & JACKIE CHAN make Karate Kid worth while,1276646400,"06 16, 2010",2010,3343,"['Karate', 'Kid', 'was', 'touch-n-go', 'experience', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'were', 'times', 'where', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'enjoyed', 'beauty', 'China', 'quality', 'film', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'wish', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'duplicated', 'original', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'script', 'so', 'much', 'say', 'new', 'version', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'instead', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'Ralph', 'Macchio', ""'ll"", 'try', 'cover', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'First', 'all', 'taking', 'movie', 'China', 'was', 'brilliant', 'move', 'culture', 'China', 'was', 'well', 'captured', 'was', 'opinion', '2nd', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'creators', 'decided', 'stick', 'original', 'screenplay', 'many', 'times', 'own', 'fault', 'original', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Daniel', 'was', 'moved', 'California', 'Not', 'big', 'culture', 'move', 'Most', 'adapting', 'new', 'place', 'was', 'entirely', 'friend', 'problem', 'new', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Dre', 'moved', 'States', 'CHINA', 'A', 'huge', 'culture', 'move', 'yet', 'creators', 'decided', 'stick', 'original', 'script', 'lose', 'LOT', 'dilemma', 'overwhelmingness', 'kid', 'trying', 'make', 'place', 'where', ""n't"", 'know', 'language', 'make', 'friends.The', 'decision', 'creators', 'stick', 'original', 'screenplay', 'was', 'times', 'disaster', 'times', 'okay', 'was', 'never', 'great', 'was', 'few', 'times', 'where', 'used', 'creative', 'liberties', 'took', 'film', 'better', 'places', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Han', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'top', 'mountain', 'learn', 'true', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'festival', 'where', 'Dre', 'first', 'kiss', 'Meiying.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'Karate', 'First', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'course', 'phenominal', 'REAL', 'karate', 'artist', 'gave', 'legitamacy', 'film', 'possibly', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'scenes', 'very', 'believable', 'course', 'Chan', 'scene', 'when', 'fight', 'six', 'teenagers', 'who', 'are', 'ganging', 'up', 'Dre', 'just', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'top', 'awesome.There', 'are', 'many', 'times', 'when', 'found', 'choked', 'up', 'was', 'leaning', 'really', 'really', 'enjoying', 'film', 'giving', '4', 'stars', 'final', 'scene', 'final', 'scene', 'course', 'when', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Dre', 'case', 'way', 'ranks', 'Mr.', 'Han', 'proud', 'tournament', 'seemed', 'go', 'much', 'faster', 'new', 'version', 'taking', 'away', 'realism', 'how', 'made', 'finals', 'Also', 'director', 'decided', 'use', 'unsteady', 'cam', 'zooms', 'twists', 'fight', 'destroying', 'realism', 'fights', 'sucking', 'fun', 'Finally', 'Dre', 'scene', 'locker', 'room', 'Mr.', 'Han', 'heal', 'leg', 'can', 'fight', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'Morita/Macchio', 'scene', 'was', 'empty', 'had', 'zero', 'impact', 'Finally', 'crane', 'kick', 'gone', 'place', 'quite', 'simply', 'something', 'silly.Had', 'tournament', 'had', 'same', 'impact', 'original', 'had', 'people', 'hearts', 'watched', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'given', '4', 'stars', 'Then', 'again', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'was', 'same', 'script', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprised', '9-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'said', 'left', 'theatre', 'heart', 'was', 'racing', 'Dad', 'So', 'know', 'maybe', 'knew', 'version', 'will', 'have', 'new', 'impact', 'young', 'kids', 'today', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'kid', ""'m"", 'writing', 'review', '2', 'cents']",N/A
1312054,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG99CC,Chris Pandolfi,"[113, 134]","""The Karate Kid"" is very much a worthy counterpart to the 1984 film on which it's based, not only in terms of story, but also in terms of quality; the excitement, humor, warmth, and themes of friendship, maturity, and overcoming adversity have been left intact, and better still, there's no sense that any of it has been cheapened or simplified to the sake of appealing to a mass audience. The only exception, and I'm really just nitpicking here, is a glorious but contrived aerial shot of martial arts training directly on the Great Wall of China, the helicopter camera zooming around Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith as they pose dramatically. If there was ever an image that belonged in a Chinese tourism commercial, this would be it.A more substantial criticism is that, because this is such a faithful remake, there isn't much it can do to surprise us. Anyone familiar with the 1984 film will know exactly how this new version will play out, from the main character's awkward arrival at the start to the climactic tournament at the end. There is a bit of an inconsistency; because it takes place in China, the featured martial art is kung fu, not karate, so the title is technically inaccurate. There's also the convenience of all the important characters being able to speak English, if not fluently, then just enough to get their point across. But it's all done so well that we may find ourselves suppressing the desire to look for flaws and make comparisons. What would be the point? Remake or not, this movie stands entirely on its own as a great entertainment, not just as a sports drama and a spectacle but also as a coming-of-age story, which is just as charming and insightful as it was twenty-six years ago.Smith plays twelve-year-old Dre Parker, who's forced to move from Detroit to Beijing with his mother (Taraji P. Henson). He doesn't much care for it, although he does immediately develop a crush on a good-natured girl named Mei Ying (Han Wenwen), a violin prodigy. Unfortunately, this introduces him to the sadistic school bully, Cheng (Wang Zhenwei), who quickly and brutally takes him down in full view of the other kids. How did he become so aggressive? A visit to a local kung fu class explains everything: Cheng's teacher, Master Li (Rongguang Yu), has taught him to be merciless when fighting his enemies. Mercy, he says, is for the weak. Dre, both small-statured and a foreigner, is considered a weakling. The idea that the underdog is separated by culture as well as by status is something the original film never had the chance to explore. It's a welcome addition.So is Jackie Chan, who takes the reins from the late Pat Morita and transforms Mr. Miyagi into Mr. Han, a reclusive janitor who agrees to train Dre for an upcoming kung fu tournament. After his disastrous starring role in ""The Spy Next Door,"" I had my doubts that Chan would be able to pull this off. I was happily proven wrong; this is his most mature and compelling performance to date, having been given the opportunity to genuinely act and not merely be a goofy action star. We see range. We see depth. We can conceivably feel something for his character. And for once, the kung fu moves he built his reputation on are actually in service of the story. He's not a stuntman showing off - he's a wise elder trying to make a point, and just like with Pat Morita's character, it involves a menial task that must be done repeatedly, almost to the point of a compulsion.Some may object to the puppy love between Dre and Mei Ying, paling in comparison to the original film's teenage love between Ralph Macchio and Elisabeth Shue. While I agree that there's no such thing as romance before puberty, I am aware that those tween years see the emergence of hormones, and I can certainly believe that Dre and Mei Ying would have their first kiss by the light of a rear-screen projector. There's no sense believing that they're falling in love, because they're not. If anything, they form a sweet and innocent friendship, one made stronger by the fact that both are being tested by their own life circumstances. And much like the divide between Dre and Cheng, both are threatened by cultural differences, Mei Ying's parents fearful that a musically uninspired American boy will be a bad influence on her. Like all good boys, he just wants make a fine first impression.A stretch in the middle of the film reveals views of mist-shrouded mountains and tours of ancient temples, where kung fu students practice rigorously. This is perhaps a bit conventional, but it's also undeniably breathtaking. I'm addressing that last observation to those who can't bring themselves to see this movie for its story or its characters - maybe the visuals will win them over. Still, don't be so quick to dismiss everything else it has to offer. Yes, ""The Karate Kid"" is yet another Hollywood remake, but that doesn't change the fact that it tells an engaging story with interesting characters and features good performances. I greatly enjoyed this movie, and if you go into it with an open mind, I think you will too.",4,"I Promise Teach You Kung Fu, You Promise Learn",1276214400,"06 11, 2010",2010,5078,"['Karate', 'Kid',

At the same time, the idea behind the first one is that Karate is indeed an 'art' that has more meaning than just revenge and fighting- karate is a lifestyle that helps a kid achieve balance in his life. Blindly substituting one martial art for another for the sake of cashing in on a name seems opposed to the deeper theme of the first movie. The producers of this remake essentially tell us, 'punching, kicking, karate, kung fu... it's all the same,"" and along with this substitution we don't see any real character growth or transformation here.It's might seem like Smith is phoning in his lines but I think that (more accurately) he just wasn't ready for the role. Why would anyone expect him to be? He's so little, and that really stands out throughout this entire film. Not just his height, but his emotional understanding of the issues that drive the plot. The original is more powerful in that the events, silly as they seem, are believable and have more weight. We understood that if the protagonist didn't assert himself he would continue to be an outcast. Here, I'm really not sure what the outcome of any of the events matter. Smith's character  doesn't bother to learn Chinese so I don't expect for him to immigrate and it's likely his mom will be reassigned back to the US. Any relationships are only transient so what difference does anything make and how important is any of it? It's unfortunate that the producers didn't recognize some things from the first movie wouldn't work in the second, or would just seem odd and contrived, like his 'relationship' with the Chinese girl. Should a boy who looks 8 years old have a vested romantic relationship with a girl? I don't think so, but there was a boy-girl relationship in the original so why not here? Again, very poor choice.The saddest part of this remake is the finale. It follows the first up to a given point and just like the first, the protagonist receives a really bad blow to the leg that should end his tournament aspirations- well, that's what happened in the original. Heck, I thought Ralph Macchio would be crippled for life. Here, Jaden seems like he simply stubbed his toe. After a similar mysterious 'magic hands' homeopathic healing from his teacher Jaden is back and literally bouncing around on the bad leg. Hopping, bouncing, running around, ducking, bobbing, weaving. He doesn't even wince when he steps on the bad leg... well, until it gets hit... AGAIN!!! Completely unnecessary. Then he's wincing and we know he's going to pull out the 'crane' or something to that effect. But here, it's not the crane- and that's where this movie seriously disappoints. I didn't NEED the crane but the storyline depends on a real simple move that a guy can do with one bad leg. The crane works because it's the only thing that would have.What do they do here? OK, what's the next best thing a kid with one leg would do? A perfectly timed, Pele' flip kind of thing that completely depends upon the attacker to be at a precise place at the precise moment. Even a Jedi Knight wouldn't have considered such a move, but a 12 year old who looks 8 on a bad leg, facing a taller opponent for the last point... of course, why not?That move, whatever they want to call it, sums up this whole move: a big flash to give Jaden an acting credit.Well, he's got one. Perhaps his next venture will work with his talent rather than his parents' aspirations.",1,Style over substance,1351900800,"11 3, 2012",2012,3524,"['can', 'overlook', 'inaccurate', 'title', 'protagonist', 'here', 'kung-fu', 'opposed', 'karate', 'original', 'same', 'time', 'idea', 'first', 'one', 'Karate', 'indeed', ""'art"", 'more', 'meaning', 'just', 'revenge', 'fighting-', 'karate', 'lifestyle', 'kid', 'achieve', 'balance', 'life', 'Blindly', 'substituting', 'one', 'martial', 'art', 'sake', 'cashing', 'name', 'opposed', 'deeper', 'theme', 'first', 'movie', 'producers', 'remake', 'essentially', 'tell', ""'punching"", 'kicking', 'karate', 'kung', 'fu', 'same', 'substitution', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'real', 'character', 'growth', 'transformation', 'here.It', 'might', 'seem', 'Smith', 'phoning', 'lines', 'think', 'more', 'accurately', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'ready', 'role', 'Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'expect', 'be', 'so', 'little', 'really', 'out', 'entire', 'film', 'Not', 'just', 'height', 'emotional', 'understanding', 'issues', 'drive', 'plot', 'original', 'more', 'powerful', 'events', 'silly', 'seem', 'are', 'believable', 'have', 'more', 'weight', 'understood', 'protagonist', 'did', ""n't"", 'assert', 'would', 'continue', 'be', 'outcast', 'Here', ""'m"", 'really', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'outcome', 'events', 'matter', 'Smith', 'character', ""n't"", 'bother', 'learn', 'Chinese', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'immigrate', 'likely', 'mom', 'will', 'be', 'reassigned', 'back', 'US', 'relationships', 'are', 'only', 'transient', 'so', 'what', 'difference', 'anything', 'make', 'how', 'important', 'unfortunate', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'things', 'first', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'second', 'would', 'just', 'seem', 'odd', 'contrived', ""'relationship"", 'Chinese', 'girl', 'Should', 'boy', 'who', '8', 'years', 'old', 'have', 'vested', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'girl', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'there', 'was', 'boy-girl', 'relationship', 'original', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'here', 'Again', 'very', 'poor', 'choice.The', 'saddest', 'part', 'remake', 'finale', 'first', 'up', 'given', 'point', 'just', 'first', 'protagonist', 'really', 'bad', 'blow', 'leg', 'should', 'end', 'tournament', 'aspirations-', 'well', 'what', 'happened', 'original', 'Heck', 'thought', 'Ralph', 'Macchio', 'would', 'be', 'crippled', 'life', 'Here', 'Jaden', 'simply', 'stubbed', 'toe', 'similar', 'mysterious', 'hands', 'homeopathic', 'healing', 'teacher', 'Jaden', 'back', 'literally', 'bouncing', 'around', 'bad', 'leg', 'Hopping', 'bouncing', 'running', 'around', 'ducking', 'bobbing', 'weaving', ""n't"", 'even', 'wince', 'when', 'bad', 'leg', 'well', 'hit', 'AGAIN', 'Completely', 'unnecessary', 'Then', 'wincing', 'know', 'going', 'pull', 'out', ""'crane"", 'something', 'effect', 'here', 'not', 'crane-', 'where', 'movie', 'seriously', 'disappoints', 'did', ""n't"", 'NEED', 'crane', 'storyline', 'real', 'simple', 'move', 'guy', 'can', 'do', 'one', 'bad', 'leg', 'crane', 'only', 'thing', 'would', 'have.What', 'do', 'do', 'here', 'OK', 'what', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'kid', 'one', 'leg', 'would', 'do', 'perfectly', 'timed', 'Pele', 'flip', 'kind', 'thing', 'completely', 'attacker', 'be', 'precise', 'place', 'precise', 'moment', 'Even', 'Jedi', 'Knight', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'considered', 'move', '12', 'year', 'old', 'who', '8', 'bad', 'leg', 'facing', 'taller', 'opponent', 'last', 'point', 'course', 'why', 'not', 'move', 'want', 'call', 'up', 'whole', 'move', 'big', 'flash', 'give', 'Jaden', 'acting', 'credit.Well', 'got', 'one', 'Perhaps', 'next', 'venture', 'will', 'work', 'talent', 'rather', 'parents', 'aspirations']",N/A

1312057,A1JYFCI5TR09O8,B002ZG99CC,"CR Hawk ""Mr Vic""","[7, 11]","I recently purchased the DVD box set containing the original ""Karate Kid"" movies and had the pleasure of watching them with my 2 boys, who are 14 and 13 years old.  So naturally, when the 2010 version came to the big screen, I had to take them to see it.  I was pleasantly surprised.There's a reason this 2010 version of ""The Karate Kid"" has racked in nearly $180 million worldwide--it's even better than the original.I have to respectfully disagree with a few of the reviewers who state this movie is not as good as, or similar enough to, the original: while parts of this rendition are different than 1984's version (the 2010 movie takes place in China and kung fu is practiced versus karate), the key thematic element is the same (a boy struggles and then ultimately succeeds in finding his inner--and outer--strength with the help of a wise mentor).  Thus, the remake is justified and it is a success.The four key players do an exemplary job: Jaden Smith, aka Dre, in the title role; Jackie Chan as Mr Han; Zhenwei Wang as Cheng, the bully; and Wenwen Han as Meiying, the pretty young Chinese girl who captures Dre's heart.  Jaden Smith does an excellent job at balancing the energy and emotion of his young character, while Jackie Chan succeeds with flying colors in acting as the Yoda-type teacher, and does so in a serious, subtle style rarely seen in his other movies.The script perfectly leverages action and emotion, the fighting scenes are well choreographed, and the camerawork and direction are fanstastic.Bottom line: ""Jacket on!

1312060,A3DGVB3T5QJNRE,B002ZG99CC,Danny G.,"[6, 11]","I can still remember my very favorable emotional response after all these years to the original Karate Kid! This poor remake does not light a candle to the original. I found this version of the Karate Kid to be sour, dour and at times, agonizingly contrived. I was also surprised that Jaden Smith often came across as a pouty rich kid not getting his way. Regardless if I had seen the original Karate Kid, or not, I still would have strongly disliked this new version because it lacks heart and believability!This is also a political film! China is portrayed as a wonderful country full of stunning beauty and regular people, like you and me. It felt like the screenplay was approved by a Public Relations firm hired by the Chinese government. Whether that actually happened, or not, China was portrayed in such a misleading way you would think there's hardly any difference between, say, Brooklyn, New York and Beijing, China! But there are REALLY BIG differences! Here is a succinct summary by a retired Chinese college professor on how incredibly different our two cultures are:""China is a one-party dictatorship. All the real power in China is firmly in the hands of nine men -- the members of the standing committee of the Politburo of the CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY (CCP). The People's Congress is just a rubber stamp of the Politburo of the CCP; the Government a mere front of the Party. The armed police force, the regular police force and the judicial system, as well as the mammoth mass media, are all under the tight control of the Party, which means the CCP leadership controls both the bodies and minds of the population. Even religions are under government control. Believers can only worship in government-sanctioned and supervised churches, temples and mosques. The Chinese internet police, composed of about 30,000 university graduates with degrees in computing sciences, monitor and intercept internet communication 24 hours, seven days a week.There is no freedom of thought, no freedom of speech. Dissenters are severely punished. The spokesperson of the CCP regime recently said at a news conference that there are no political dissenters in China, only ""criminals"". The last bastion of the CCP dictatorship is the mighty armed forces of China -- the People's Liberation Army, which pledges its absolute loyalty to the CCP, and declares its dual function of maintaining domestic stability as well as national defense.""If that's not bad enough, I'll also add: ""Only ONE PERCENT of the China's 560 million city dwellers breath air considered safe by European Union standards according to a World Bank study. Air pollution is particularly bad in the rust belt areas of northeastern China. A study done by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that the amount of airborne suspended particulates in northern China are almost 20 times what WHO considers a safe level.""These huge differences between our two cultures were only too happily glossed over by Hollywood in order to maximize their profits. I'm also sure the Chinese government would have pulled the plug on filming the Karate Kid in a heartbeat if they didn't like the screenplay!See:The Karate KidandClearing the Air: The Health and Economic Damages of Air Pollution in ChinaandCapitalism without Democracy: The Private Sector in Contemporary China",1,Did the Chinese Government Help Write the Screenplay?,1362096000,"03 1, 2013",2013,3328,"['can', 'still', 'remember', 'very', 'favorable', 'emotional', 'response', 'years', 'original', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'poor', 'remake', 'not', 'light', 'candle', 'original', 'found', 'version', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'be', 'sour', 'dour', 'times', 'agonizingly', 'contrived', 'was', 'also', 'surprised', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'often', 'came', 'pouty', 'rich', 'kid', 'not', 'getting', 'way', 'Regardless', 'had', 'seen', 'original', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'not', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'strongly', 'disliked', 'new', 'version', 'heart', 'believability', 'also', 'political', 'film', 'China', 'portrayed', 'wonderful', 'country', 'full', 'stunning', 'beauty', 'regular', 'people', 'felt', 'screenplay', 'was', 'approved', 'Public', 'Relations', 'firm', 'hired', 'Chinese', 'government', 'actually', 'happened', 'not', 'China', 'was', 'portrayed', 'such', 'misleading', 'way', 'would', 'think', 'hardly', 'difference', 'say', 'Brooklyn', 'New', 'York', 'Beijing', 'China', 'are', 'REALLY', 'BIG', 'differences', 'Here', 'succinct', 'summary', 'retired', 'Chinese', 'college', 'professor', 'how', 'incredibly', 'different', 'two', 'cultures', 'are', 'China', 'one-party', 'dictatorship', 'real', 'power', 'China', 'firmly', 'hands', 'nine', 'men', 'members', 'standing', 'committee', 'Politburo', 'CHINESE', 'COMMUNIST', 'PARTY', 'CCP', 'People', 'Congress', 'just', 'rubber', 'stamp', 'Politburo', 'CCP', 'Government', 'mere', 'front', 'Party', 'armed', 'police', 'force', 'regular', 'police', 'force', 'judicial', 'system', 'as', 'well', 'mammoth', 'mass', 'media', 'are', 'tight', 'control', 'Party', 'CCP', 'leadership', 'bodies', 'minds', 'population', 'Even', 'religions', 'are', 'government', 'control', 'Believers', 'can', 'only', 'worship', 'government-sanctioned', 'supervised', 'churches', 'temples', 'mosques', 'Chinese', 'internet', 'police', 'composed', '30,000', 'university', 'graduates', 'degrees', 'computing', 'sciences', 'monitor', 'intercept', 'internet', 'communication', '24', 'hours', 'seven', 'days', 'freedom', 'thought', 'freedom', 'speech', 'Dissenters', 'are', 'severely', 'punished', 'spokesperson', 'CCP', 'regime', 'recently', 'said', 'news', 'conference', 'are', 'political', 'dissenters', 'China', 'only', 'criminals', 'last', 'bastion', 'CCP', 'dictatorship', 'mighty', 'armed', 'forces', 'China', 'People', 'Liberation', 'Army', 'absolute', 'loyalty', 'CCP', 'dual', 'function', 'maintaining', 'domestic', 'stability', 'as', 'well', 'national', 'defense', 'not', 'bad', 'enough', ""'ll"", 'also', 'add', 'Only', 'ONE', 'PERCENT', 'China', '560', 'million', 'city', 'dwellers', 'breath', 'air', 'considered', 'safe', 'European', 'Union', 'standards', 'according', 'World', 'Bank', 'study', 'Air', 'pollution', 'particularly', 'bad', 'rust', 'belt', 'areas', 'northeastern', 'China', 'study', 'done', 'World', 'Health', 'Organization', 'WHO', 'estimated', 'amount', 'airborne', 'suspended', 'particulates', 'northern', 'China', 'are', 'almost', '20', 'times', 'what', 'WHO', 'safe', 'level', 'huge', 'differences', 'two', 'cultures', 'were', 'only', 'too', 'happily', 'glossed', 'over', 'Hollywood', 'order', 'maximize', 'profits', ""'m"", 'also', 'sure', 'Chinese', 'government', 'would', 'have', 'pulled', 'plug', 'filming', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'heartbeat', 'did', ""n't"", 'screenplay', 'See', 'Karate', 'KidandClearing', 'Air', 'Health', 'Economic', 'Damages', 'Air', 'Pollution', 'ChinaandCapitalism', 'Democracy', 'Private', 'Sector', 'Contemporary', 'China']",N/A

With the announcement of martial arts superstar Jackie Chan as the first star named, although I love Jackie Chan, I was even more skeptical because of the location of where the film would take place (China) and that karate is not a Chinese martial art.  Also, that director Harold Zwart  (""Agent Cody Banks"", ""Pink Panther 2') would be the direct.  And to even further my skepticism, the announcement of actor Will Smith's young son Jaden Smith (""The Pursuit of Happyness"", ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"") as the main character did calm my nerves one bit.That is until I watched the film.And what an enjoyable film ""The Karate Kid"" remake  came to be and many people agreed as the film which was budgeted around $40 million had made $334 million worldwide and the majority of the reviews were positive.  And as for the name ""The Karate Kid"", despite the film not having anything to do with karate, because the film is a remake, for the American release, the film will be known as ""The Karate Kid"" but in Asia, the film would go by the name ""The Kung Fu Kid"".VIDEO:""The Karate Kid"" (2010) is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  If there is one thing that this remake does have an edge over the original is that this film was shot in China and the film looks absolutely beautiful in HD.  There is so much detail in this film, may it be the paint peeling off  from the walls or wood, the detail on the wood bars when Dre visits a Kung-Fu training area.  The film looks absolutely magnificent on Blu-ray!The film is absolutely breathtaking as we see how wonderful the cinematography is (courtesy of Roger Pratt, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"", ""Iris"", ""Chocolat"") when we see the various mountainous regions of China, the Great Wall of China and surprisingly how much access the filmmaker was given to shoot this film.  But also it helps to have the co-production with a major Chinese film company who also wanted to make the film look authentic and real.Colors are absolute vibrant, flesh tones look fantastic, backs are nice and deep and once again, the detail of this film and the colors are just wonderful.  Everything about the picture quality of this film is pristine and there is a fine layer of grain on the film.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Karate Kid"" (201o) not only looks spectacular, the lossless audio is also fantastic.  The film is presented in English and French 5.1 DTS-HD MA and also presented in English - Audio Description 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The dialogue is crisp and clear.  The music of James Horner (""Avatar"", ""Troy"", ""Enemy at the Gates"", ""Titanic"") is as always fantastic and you also get a good dose of popular music with Lady Gaga and Flo Rida.  But as the dialogue and music comes perfectly from the center and front channels but also, there is great use of the surround channels.Earlier on, you can hear the punching and the kicks coming from the surround channels but you can also hear the ambiance of crowds (especially during the tournament), the rain, Mr. Han working on his car (or demolishing his car), ""Karate Kid"" is such a film that takes advantage of the soundscape. Overall, the audio quality for ""The Karate Kid"" is fantastic!Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH and French.SPECIAL FEATURES""The Karate Kid"" comes with the following special features presented in HD, English Stereo and English subtitles:* ON LOCATION: The Karate Kid Interactive Map of China - Director Harald Zwart talks about capturing China's culture in the film and also the challenges at shooting in the various locations in China such as the Wudang Mountains (4:24); The Great Wall which includes filming at the China Film Group Film Base at Huairou (4:45) and shooting a the Great Wall (1:36); Beijing:  Beiying Film Studios (2:36), Beijing Shaolin Wushu School (1:34), Feng Tai Sports Arena (2:05), the Forbidden City (1:05), Olympic Park (:59) .* Alternate Ending - (3:32) An ending that makes the film become more like what we would see from a  Jackie Chan martial arts film but it does take away the primary focus of  the story which is about Dre.  Cool action sequence but I'm glad this ending was not used.* Play All Hosted by Jackie Chan - (29:44) Featuring the production diaries as one full documentary hosted by Jackie Chan.* Production Diaries Hosted by Jackie Chan - A total of nine production diaries which include: Training Jaden (3:12), Jaden Smith, A Day in the Life (3:50), The Forbidden City (3:59), From Jackie with Love (3:56), The Great Wall (3:10), Olympic Village (3:06), Director Profile (2:19), Taraji P. Henson Goes to China (2:40) and Wudang Mountains (3:19).* Chinese Lessons - Learn Chinese! - An interactive feature that teaches viewers basic Chinese words and phrases.

I watched the original film several dozen times and as mentioned in my review for the original film, it's a film that I just never get tired of.  It's hard not to dislike a film about an underdog but with ""Karate Kid"" (2002), there are many things that impressed me.First, the acting performance by both Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan.  Jaden Smith really went through a lot in the training of this film and with the original film,  Ralph Macchio was pretty much a man playing a teenage role, while Jaden Smith, he is a young kid and what the director (especially his producer parents) brought out of him was pretty well-done.  He has the bravado and slight cockiness like the original film's Daniel Larusso but it is quite evident, Smith went through major training much more than Ralph Macchio probably had to go through.In fact, Jaden Smith studied martial arts for more than half a year, three months learning Wushu and weapons training from a stunt coordinator that has worked with Jackie Chan.  So, to make this film look convincing, Jaden Smith really dedicated himself into practicing as well as enduring pain for this fim.If there is one thing where the film was make it or break it, it was the chemistry between Smith and Chan.  Jackie Chan was absolutely marvelous in this film.  We have heard Jackie talk about wanting to play serious roles and we have seen that with his 2009 film ""Shinjuku Incident"" but not only does the filmmakers give him action scenes, they gave Chan the opportunity to show that he can do emotional crying scenes and there is no doubt that Chan's performance will have people tearing in one of the more emotional scenes of the film.What also works is how beautiful this film looks and how well the pacing was for the overall film.  Harald Zwart did an incredible job in the overall execution.  From wanting to get the right shots, getting the right look and feel for the film and even being under the gun of shooting in locations that were difficult to shoot at or they only had less than a half hour window to shoot at.For example, filming at the Forbidden City (which was the first time since ""The Last Emperor"") is constantly visited by visitors throughout the day and so they only had 20 minutes to shoot during the early morning before the visitors arrived.  Zwart managed the time and schedule very well.So,  Zwart was able to accomplish a lot during the filming of ""The Karate Kid"" and it helps that he was paired with a wonderful cinematographer, Roger Pratt and musician/composer James Horner.  Zwart's cinematography is fantastic and if anything, what he was able to capture on film looks absolutely gorgeous in HD and the same goes with James Horner who knows how to create movie soundtracks.  Horner has done a tremendous job for films like ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar"" and he did a great job for ""The Karate Kid"" and it helps that the film does have music that will appeal to younger fans who love Lady GaGa, Justin Bieber and Flo Rida.And also deserving recognition is screenwriter Christopher Murphy and writer Robert Mark Kamen (""Taken"", ""The Fifth Element"" and ""Transporter"" films) in making sure the story for this remake was good and doing a lot of the research needed to make this film seem authentic.As for the Blu-ray, you really can't go wrong as not only do you get a film that looks absolutely fantastic and sounds wonderful on Blu-ray, you also get a good number of special features included in this release that makes ""The Karate Kid"" worth owning.Overall, I know there are quite a number of my friends who refuse to watch this film because of its title (since the martial art focused in the film is Kung Fu) and those who still appreciate and love the original film that they can't support a remake.  Some have issues with filmmaker Harald Zwart and even Jaden Smith playing the lead role.  But I don't blame them because I know how that feels because I felt the same way.I was very skeptical towards this film and the truth is, there are many remakes that are terrible but this is not one of them.  The film is not only faithful to the original film but it gives us even more than the original to love and enjoy, and as I will always love the original film, I have to say that I really enjoyed this remake of ""The Karate Kid"" as well and  I really enjoyed this Blu-ray release!  It's an awesome release!If you loved the film  or looking for an action-based, underdog against his rivals type of martial arts film that is inspirational, heartfelt and entertaining,  ""The Karate Kid"" (2010) is highly recommended.",5,Blu-ray: I was skeptical at first but this movie is pretty good! And the Blu-ray is awesome!,1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,10369,"['When', 'word', 'came', 'out', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'would', 'receive', 'remake', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'quite', 'skeptical',

1312065,A3GHBLTVJLRPAH,B002ZG99CC,Derek,"[1, 1]","To cut straight to the point, I really liked this film. I felt it paid nice homage to the originalThe Karate Kidwithout attempting to replace it. Jaden Smith is becoming a very strong actor; and who can't love good, ol' Jackie Chan?Karate Kid is the story of Dre (Jaden Smith), a Detroit-bred 12 year-old, who moves to China and attempts to overcome his fear of being different by challenging some local karate bullies in a renowned karate tournament.The story went a long way farther in character development and motive than did the original 1984 classic. Instead of a white kid moving into the wrong part of another white-dominated town, a young black family moves to China. If there is anything that could be called a culture clash, that is it. Not only does Dre look different, but he acts different, he talks different, and to make things more complicated, he doesn't try to fit in. The film has a perfect setup for the progression of the rest of the film.While no one can replace Pat Morita as Mr. Miyagi, Jackie Chan does a excellent job in filling his shoes as Mr. Han. If anyone is known as a karate master in our culture, it's Jackie Chan. And I think the aging Chan did very well at playing his part as an old, embittered man that is conflicted in helping young Dre while attempting to be distant.The karate moves in this film are levels above those seen in the original and it's a lot more exciting to watch. While I hoped to see the legendary movie moments reappear in this film (catching a fly with chopsticks, ""wax on"" and ""wax off"", final crane kick) I was glad when they never showed. That allows the two films to be just as different and memorable in their own ways and both remain enjoyable to watch. The film tends to be a little longer than expected, but it still keeps you involved and interested throughout.This was a fantastic film and it was very well done and very entertaining.[...]",5,Fantastic film,1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,1909,"['cut', 'straight', 'point', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'felt', 'paid', 'nice', 'homage', 'originalThe', 'Karate', 'Kidwithout', 'attempting', 'replace', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'becoming', 'very', 'strong', 'actor', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'love', 'good', 'ol', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'story', 'Dre', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'Detroit-bred', '12', 'year-old', 'who', 'China', 'attempts', 'overcome', 'fear', 'being', 'different', 'challenging', 'local', 'karate', 'bullies', 'renowned', 'karate', 'tournament.The', 'story', 'went', 'long', 'way', 'farther', 'character', 'development', 'motive', 'did', 'original', '1984', 'classic', 'Instead', 'white', 'kid', 'moving', 'wrong', 'part', 'white-dominated', 'town', 'young', 'black', 'family', 'moves', 'China', 'anything', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'culture', 'clash', 'Not', 'only', 'Dre', 'look', 'different', 'different', 'different', 'make', 'things', 'more', 'complicated', ""n't"", 'try', 'fit', 'film', 'perfect', 'setup', 'progression', 'rest', 'film.While', 'one', 'can', 'replace', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'excellent', 'job', 'filling', 'shoes', 'Mr.', 'Han', 'anyone', 'known', 'karate', 'master', 'culture', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'think', 'aging', 'Chan', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'playing', 'part', 'old', 'embittered', 'man', 'conflicted', 'helping', 'young', 'Dre', 'attempting', 'be', 'distant.The', 'karate', 'moves', 'film', 'are', 'levels', 'seen', 'original', 'lot', 'more', 'exciting', 'watch', 'hoped', 'see', 'legendary', 'movie', 'moments', 'reappear', 'film', 'catching', 'fly', 'chopsticks', 'wax', 'wax', 'off', 'final', 'crane', 'kick', 'was', 'glad', 'when', 'never', 'showed', 'two', 'films', 'be', 'just', 'different', 'memorable', 'own', 'ways', 'remain', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'film', 'be', 'little', 'longer', 'expected', 'still', 'involved', 'interested', 'throughout.This', 'was', 'fantastic', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'very', 'entertaining.', '[', ']']",N/A

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 1]","Over the years I've enjoyed watching the 1984 version of THE KARATE KID, but let's be honest, it's just a tad syrupy.  And of course, with its poodle hair-dos and bubblegum musical score, the original is definitely showing its age.  And my indifference, upon learning actors Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith were going to produce a remake, was acute; after all, don't we all know the story?  So I ran across the 2010 KARATE KID the other night on cable, and pulled up a chair.  The story of a gangly youth in a new environment trying to adjust to his surroundings, being mentored by a caring, yet flawed, senior gentleman, hits the mark as portrayed by Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan.  This version takes place in China, where Dre Parker and his mother, Sherry (I love Taraji P. Henson), have just moved from the US.  So what's in store for Dre?  A major cultural adjustment.  And on Dre's first day there, on the playgrounds outside his apartment, he encounters first a romantic interest in Meiying (Wenwen Han), and then a gang of bullies, led by a snarling Cheng (Zhenwei Wang).  Following a handful of profound arse kickings (and the violence is pretty graphic), Dre receives aid from maintenance man Han (Chan), who teaches Dre how to protect himself by mastering kung fu; yet his training regimen, to say the least, is unorthodox.Jaden Smith has inherited the acting chops from his gifted parents, and he delivers a most believable performance as a tormented, beleaguered youth only trying to fit in.  Not to mention his athleticism is staggering; I still can't believe some of the moves I witnessed.  And Jackie Chan turns in, in my opinion, the performance of his career, playing soft-spoken, kindly Han--a man haunted by a most unpleasant past.  Chan's character, even when smiling, reflects a constant pain and sadness, and it's compelling and utterly believable.  The supporting cast is solid, and the story moves swiftly to the climactic martial arts tournament, where the action, for lack of a better word, is astounding.  If Smith doesn't go into acting he darn sure needs to pursue a career in MMA. And with the championship match, between Dre and Cheng--even though we all know what is going to happen--you'll find yourself cheering aloud from your chair. Remakes are often bland and contrived--and this remake does meander at times--yet in this instance, the 2010 version of THE KARATE KID outshines the original.  Jacket on, jacket off.--D.

1312068,A1QLA4I6BFLJP3,B002ZG99CC,D. Porter,"[4, 9]","Having seen the original years ago, I was hesitant to see the remake.  I didn't particularly enjoy the first one (Ralph Macchio always seemed whiny to me), and remakes rarely make a significant improvement.  This film is an exception.If you have seen the original (hasn't everyone), you know the storyline.  While some details have changes, the overall plot is the same.  Here are some of the most noticeable improvements:-Jaden Smith.  As the main character, he is amazing.  Granted, his parents are Hollywood royalty.  Regardless, his athleticism makes his character much more convincing than Macchio's and his presence on screen is remarkable for such a young actor.  Very well done.-Jackie Chan.  I never had a problem with Pat Morita's portrayal in the original, but Jackie is wonderful.  He actually uses his acting skills convincingly, and his action shots are predictably great.  I wouldn't have thought of Jackie Chan for this role, he manages to nail it.-Fighting scenes.  This is where the original really lost me.  The scenes in this film are a big upgrade.  Whereas in the original the fighting scenes looked like what you would expect to see at the local karate school, the sequences in this film are what you would expect from a major motion picture.Don't go seeing it expecting some deep analysis of the human condition.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","THE KARATE KID (2010), I must say, is the first time I've seen such a good film panned by so many dense, unobservant reviews. I read about how unimpressed people were with the Great Wall; how surprised everyone is that Jackie Chan can act; how powerful Will Smith must be to be able to ""buy"" all-access to China.A waste of words.This film is a beautiful remake, warts and all (yes, it does have a few). Anyone who is astonished by Jackie Chan's acting hasn't seen many Jackie Chan films. Anyone unmoved by the beautiful little Jaden Smith is heartless. If your eyeballs did not pop at some of the scenes, you must be half dead.And I do not mind admitting, I cried at certain moments. The original did not make me cry--not when new and not today.Certainly there is great though subtle humor here; much of it is in Jaden and not in Jackie, for a change. Jaden Smith is his father's son through and through. It is one of the treats of this film to see a possible great future for Jaden in film.The adaptation into this remake is cool all around. How I would have loved to see the original KARATE KID set in China. I think those unfamiliar with China should keep the sniggering down to a minimum--this film rings true enough. I can't say I loved the damned Red Star of communism flashing all over the place, but maybe they were trying to tell us something about that too.My wife and I often discuss what it is films really mean to communicate. STATE OF THE UNION (1948, see my review) is telling us government's broken...and is as true now as it was then.THE KARATE KID is telling us hope is alive and well. Hopefully you did not miss that. I cannot recommend this film enough, but I cannot let the warts go unindicated:1. There was too much of a Disneyesque air to modern China. It is hard to remember while watching this film that the government there is still jailing and killing religious/martial arts practitioners.2. There was too much violence, and the kids are all around 12 (Jaden says he is 12 in the movie). This film ought to have been geared toward the 17-ish crowd, like the original was.3.

I mean, first of all the name of it is 'the karate kid', and the film was made in China and featured Jackie Chan - of whom I am a life-long fan. So kung fu does not equal karate; I figured they could have at least called it ""the kung fu kid"", yes?After watching the film, they could call it Dark Cloud Butter Knife and I'd still love it.There are too numerous homage points to compare this new contender to the Miyagi/Daniel-san. But this is not a rehash of the successful franchise I grew up with. The acting alone... no one can say anything bad about Jackie Chan; here he is in his home, and he seems more comfortable than we have ever seen him before. The most surprising part of the film is Jaden Smith. I was worried that he got the part in the film because of his father, but he's wearing his father's charm well, and he obviously does have talent. He did most of his own stunts, and that is worth some cool in my book.The playback of this BD is flawless, picture-perfect and sounds great even in 2-channel audio. The Special Features of this version of the BD is phenomenal: you get to follow Jackie Chan across his homelands, and witness the authentic beauty that is China. There are some great featurettes, including the behind-the-scenes training of Jaden as he brings a natural athleticism to task.  There are even a handful Chinese phrase lessons. Ni hao! Wo han yu shuo de bu hao... dang zhen!If you were a fan of the originals... at least the first two, you should already own this. If you've been fence-sitting, I highly recommend this film.

There he meets Mei Ying and falls for her.

One is simply exceptional scenery; the images of China, the language, customs and culture were all fantastic to view and experience, and make Dre's transition all the more real.  Jackie Chan gives a strong effort as Mr. Han, Dre's instructor. The 2010 version also makes substantial efforts (almost to a fault) to establish the relationship between Dre and Mr. Han, as first Dre doesn't understand the attitudes of respect and discipline but grows wiser. Even Will Smith's son, Jaden Smith, does a fair job in his role.There were some drawbacks to the film, however. One was simply that the villains were a bit too prototype and over-the-top. For example, the master for the bullies comes across as an evil dictator type. Another problem was the film's length, which was just a shade under two and a half hours. Some parts of the story were a little too unnecessarily drawn out. For instance, Dre's adjustment when he first arrives in China could have been cut down a little, and it would still have given sufficient depth to the film. This causes the film to sporadically lose steam a little bit every now and then until the next major event in the plot.Still, this version of The Karate Kid does a good job of trying to build characters and storyline and, for that, I commend it.  More importantly, it has the same spirit of the original, showing how honor is crucial in one's life, and how we can achieve goals through discipline and determination.

I was just hoping for an enjoyable movie experience - and that is what I got.The Karate kid in this movie is Jaden Smith, the son of actors Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith. Jaden plays the character Dre, a kid who is enjoying his life in Detroit until his widowed mother Sherry (played by Taraji P. Henson) moves the family to China due to a job transfer. Scenes of Detroit only make cameo appearances at the beginning of the movie as Dre and Sherry leave all their family and friends at their old Detroit apartment and drive to Detroit Metro Airport.Sherry dreams of a grand, new life in China for herself and Dre. But day one, Dre makes some very violent enemies from a group of boys that are masters at Kung Fu. In short, these boys beat the snot out of Dre and take away all his self-confidence and Detroit swagger. Enter Mr. Hun (played by Jackie Chan), the apartment building handy man, who turns out to be a Kung Fu master himself. Mr. Hun agrees to train Dre for a Kung Fu tournament where Dre will have to face his fears and fight these bullies to regain his life.I really loved a lot of the aspects of this movie. The story borrows enough from the first movie to be familiar, but updates it to be more current. Dre is a typical kid with a little too much attitude and swagger for his own good. He learns from his journey that respect, honor, hard work, and discipline are very important. He also learns that facing his fear is the only way he is going to be able to gain control of his life.Besides the good storyline, the visual beauty in this film is stunning. The movie is filmed in some of the most beautiful places in China including the Birds Nest, the Forbidden City, and the Great Wall. Even simple scenes in the movie are visually eye-catching.I love Jackie Chan and he was very convincing as a troubled man who finds redemption by helping Dre learn Kung Fu. Also Jackie gets to do some of his trick fighting in this movie which was funny and very enjoyable to watch. Jaden Smith is a fine actor and overall he shows acting skills way beyond his years. But at times I think his over the top comical jestering was too much an imitation of his father Will Smith's Fresh Prince antics.Some of my pains with the movie are some of the most exciting parts - the fight scenes. As a mother, it was hard at times to watch a 12 year old child get beat up by bullies, but the kids in the theater (including my son) had no issues with it. The movie is also long - almost 2 1/2 hours, but it did not feel long to me and my son said it could have been longer as long as there were more fight scenes.My son declared the movie was ""awesome"" and he will be going back to see it with his Karate school.

1312090,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B002ZG99CC,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 5]","If a movie ever cried out for a remake, it just has to be SON OF THE MASK because that movie was so bloody awful a remake could only improve it. So, of course, instead what we get here is a remake of a boyhood classic. I saw this new KARATE KID flick in the theater just now, and maybe it's because I saw it with an audience that surprisingly cheered and applauded quite a bit, but I came out actually liking it. Oh, there are still quibbles. But now my feathers aren't quite so ruffled.What's the shelf life on that joke that this one should've been titled THE KUNG FU KID? Yeah, I'm also pretty sick of hearing that crack. But there's that age-old rule of thumb which I just made up, that if you're a foreign kid newly arrived to China, and a stranger to the local language, and then if your Chinese classmates bully you, chances are you'll just have to take the beatings. Because wrestling these guys to the ground and retaliating with meaningful noogies isn't gonna cut it. Everyone in China knows kung fu, or that's the rumor. And if you're an American 12-year-old kid recently relocated from Detroit, you probably shouldn't have been macking on the head bully's girl anyway.From his first day in Beijing onwards, it's been a sackful of unhappy for young Dre Parker. He right away gets on the bad side of Cheng, the local school tough and, by the way, formidably adept at martial arts. And it's one of the film's selling points that Cheng happens to be this really vicious bully. He seems to really relish putting a pounding on Dre, who tries to front but, really, he's defenseless. Cheng's venom serves to build the tension and also make Dre a sympathetic character. And then Dre gets an unlikely assist from his apartment building's withdrawn maintenance man, Mr. Han. If you've seen the original then you know where this is going. Mr. Han tells Dre, ""I will teach you real kung fu."" He then proceeds to instruct Dre to take his jacket on and off and on and off and on and off. Part of it is teaching Dre respect. Part of it, of course, is Mr. Han instilling rudimentary skills within his pupil. You get your usual montage bits as Mr. Han prepares Dre for the upcoming kung fu tournament, where Cheng awaits.Jaden Smith has got his old man's swagger and cocky charm. And he's pretty impressive and expressive in several dramatic moments. And unlike Ralph Macchio he actually is the age he's portraying. Macchio was in his 20s playing a high school kid. I doubt that Jaden performs the more dazzling martial arts moves his character unveils late in the film, but even the stuff leading up to it demonstrates how hard the kid worked. One of my favorite moments with Jaden actually takes place outside of kung fu. It's a scene in which he makes a lengthy apology in Chinese. Good stuff, and tough to learn. I wish the film had shown even more scenes in which the Parkers are adapting culturally.Meantime, I can't honestly say that Jackie Chan's performance equaled that of Pat Morita's in terms of charisma and gravitas. What we do see is a Jackie Chan that's far removed from his usual comical mugging. As Mr. Han, Jackie affects this reclusive demeanor and a weary bandy-legged gait, and in our normal world, this shambling figure would be the last person we'd attribute with profound martial arts skills... except that, of course, by now we're so used to kung fu movie cliches that, actually, this old guy IS someone we'd suspect of being a master. Here, Jackie is very effective when he's just being this still and quiet presence. The car scene (you'll know which one) may be just a bit smaltsy, though. That bit with Mr. Han rebuilding a car in his living room may or may not feel contrived. Still, Chan and Smith make their surrogate father-son thing work.This isn't a short movie, and tons of running time seem devoted to touristy shots of Beijing and sundry famous landscapes, but the cinematography is so good that I soaked in the awesome vistas. Predictably, plenty of themes from the original film crop up. On a down note, we get the hokey cruel martial arts master. We even get deja vus on the crane position and the ""sweep the leg"" moment. But the fight choreography is really dynamic, especially during the kung fu tournament. And that's one of my kibitzes, that this western kid with no former experience could achieve this level, that he could pick up so many dazzling skills in so short a time, especially for someone whose sole skill in the kung fu department going into his training is that he's athletic. But I guess that's where the suspension of disbelief comes in. It's a good thing the kid can act. Sadly but maybe for the best - because the sense here is that this is more Jaden's movie - Jackie Chan only gets one scene to show off his stuff, when he fends off the gang of bullies beating up on Dre.If you stick around for the closing credits, you won't get Jackie's traditional blooper/stunt reel, but you can hear that song ""Never Say Never"" where Jaden Smith is the featured rapper. Little guy really is following his father's footsteps. But, just like that this movie doesn't quite top the original, the kid isn't quite up there with the likes of the Fresh Prince. But give him time. He's only twelve.",4,"""Your focus needs more focus.""",1276300800,"06 12, 2010",2010,5235,"['movie', 'ever', 'cried', 'out', 'remake', 'just', 'be', 'SON', 'THE', 'MASK', 'movie', 'was', 'so',

This is NOT the Karate Kid, it's the Kung-Fu Kid, and it was made because Will Smith pulled some strings behind the scenes to force his untalented offspring into the movie business, he even attempts to rap over the end credits (with Justin Beiber!). Did Daddy Smith not learn enough from his own attempts at hip-hop?The story lifts wholesale from Robert Mark Kamen's 1984 screenplay, only it transplants the action from California to China. Baby Smith is Dre, who is bullied at his new school. Maintenance man Mr. Han (Jackie Chan, the only good thing about this movie) teaches him Kung-Fu and forces him into a tournament to face his arch rival bully.Baby Smith is just way too small and young for this role (I do realize that Ralph Macchio was in his 20s when he was the Karate Kid, but Daniel-san was a stronger character and he wasn't only in the movie because his dad is Wa-Wa-Wicky-Wicky Will Smith). This unwanted movie is an example of nepotism at its worst.The movie itself is very drab-looking with lots of grey, muted colors and dull environments. Director Harald Zwart (double Oscar-winner for Agent Cody Banks 2 and Pink Panther 2) uses a safe, pedestrian approach to keep the movie bloodless and inoffensive. Any parent who took their children to see this really should have just stayed at home and put on the 1984 movie. Even the 1994 sequel The Next Karate Kid was better than this shameless exercise in money-making.The Blu Ray looks and sound good with a 2.40:1 1080p picture and a DTS HD-MA soundtrack.

It is always fun to watch someone master a skill, and this film is no different. We see the boy's frustration at the inscrutable demands of his tutor, his slow mastery of skills, and the maturity and wisdom he finally achieves.

1312098,A294HSVTOCR5L4,B002ZG99CC,Jeffrey C. Meade,"[5, 5]","Karate Kid was a good movie overall, but left me still wondering why it was remade when it was over. The movie mostly matches the original in basic story even if the new version is in China.On the good side, the technology of today makes some of the scenes more realistic, especially the fights, but it still felt like something was missing in this movie when compared to the old one, as if they thought using today's technology would somehow make a better movie which seems to be a normal problem with modern remakes.Jaden Smith does a decent job with the role, but it felt like the character was a little too young. Maybe that's because I grew up watching Daniel Larusso who was supposed to be about 17 or 18 in the original. The love story is better in the new movie and was mostly a afterthought in the original, as was Jaden's relationship with his mother compared to Daniel's. The original movie focused mostly on the main plot, while the new movie attempted to branch off a bit to get a little more involved with other characters.Jackie Chan does a pretty good job with the part, but, again, it just cant compete with Pat Morita as Mr. Miyagi. The boy who plays the antagonist in this movie does a good job of making you hate him, similar to the original.The only part of the movie that seemed to defy reality a bit was the final fight scene. When Daniel Larusso did the crane technique in the original movie it was believable, but when Jaden Smith does the complete flip to kick the other kid down I was thinking no way. It just wasn't believable to me.This movie is worth seeing, but fans of the original will still walk away with a slightly sour taste afterwards.",4,Karate Kid,1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,1673,"['Karate', 'Kid', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'overall', 'left', 'still', 'wondering', 'why', 'was', 'remade', 'when', 'was', 'over', 'movie', 'mostly', 'original', 'basic', 'story', 'even', 'new', 'version', 'China.On', 'good', 'side', 'technology', 'today', 'scenes', 'more', 'realistic', 'especially', 'fights', 'still', 'felt', 'something', 'was', 'missing', 'movie', 'when', 'compared', 'old', 'one', 'thought', 'using', 'today', 'technology', 'would', 'somehow', 'make', 'better', 'movie', 'be', 'normal', 'problem', 'modern', 'remakes.Jaden', 'Smith', 'decent', 'job', 'role', 'felt', 'character', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'young', 'Maybe', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Daniel', 'Larusso', 'who', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'about', '17', '18', 'original', 'love', 'story', 'better', 'new', 'movie', 'was', 'mostly', 'afterthought', 'original', 'was', 'Jaden', 'relationship', 'mother', 'compared', 'Daniel', 'original', 'movie', 'focused', 'mostly', 'main', 'plot', 'new', 'movie', 'attempted', 'branch', 'off', 'bit', 'get', 'little', 'more', 'involved', 'other', 'characters.Jackie', 'Chan', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'part', 'again', 'just', 'cant', 'compete', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'boy', 'who', 'antagonist', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'hate', 'similar', 'original.The', 'only', 'part', 'movie', 'seemed', 'defy', 'reality', 'bit', 'was', 'final', 'fight', 'scene', 'When', 'Daniel', 'Larusso', 'did', 'crane', 'technique', 'original', 'movie', 'was', 'believable', 'when', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'complete', 'flip', 'kick', 'other', 'kid', 'down', 'was', 'thinking', 'way', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'believable', 'me.This', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'fans', 'original', 'will', 'still', 'walk', 'away', 'slightly', 'sour', 'taste', 'afterwards']",N/A

Dre hates it in China and wants to leave, but a maintenance man named Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) gives him a reason to stay when he agrees to train him for a Kung-Fu tournament against his bullies.The Karate Kid was the most unnecessary remake and the one I dreaded to see the most, ""well that is until the idiots in Hollywood decide to remake Back to the Future"", but the movie is surprisingly good. There's beautiful locations, fine acting and the film is moving despite an overly familiar story.One of my problems with the movie is how good Dre is in the tournament.

1312104,A6VFFRIHAXKRL,B002ZG99CC,"J. Paul ""John doe""","[0, 0]","I remember when I saw the trailer to The Karate Kid remake I was like oh God this is going to suck. When I was going through The Karate Kid movies a month or 2 ago I decided to rent the remake & I was surprised. The Karate Kid remake was directed by Harald Zwart he directed Agent Cody Banks & The Pink Panther 2 which this is definitively a step up for him. Stars Jackie Chan as Mr Han, Jaden Smith as Dre Parker, Tarje P Henson as Sherry Parker, Wen Wen Han as Mei Ying & Zhenwei Wang as Chang. I like it but it's no where near the magic of the 1st 2 but The Karate Kid remake respects the original & has homages but it stands on it's own 2 feet. Story is this 12 yr old boy named Dre Parker is moving from Detroit to Bejing cause the factory his mom works at is moving there. He meets this girl at The Basketball Cout named Mei Ying. Then this boy named Chang doesn't want him around her cause his family is close with Mei Ying's. Chang beats Dre up badly. Dre has to put up with Chang at school Chang flips Dre's lunch tray on him. Mei Ying is trying to become a violinist which I believe the actress is a real violinist in real life. But her & Dre become fast friends. In the original you had the hatered between Johnny & Daniel & the scene where Daniel put the hose in the bathroom stall. Dre takes a can of oil & splashes it on Chang & his friends & Dre runs back to his apartment really good chase scene. But the bullies beat him up then Mr Han comes in & saves Dre it is cool how he did it. Mr Han uses a fire cupping technique to heal Dre now I can tell it's CGI but it doesn't kill the movie for me. Dre wants Mr Han to teach him Kung Fu but he refuses. Han tries to make peace with & talk it out with Chang's teacher but ends up as the same deal as the original with Dre entering the tournament. So Mr Han train Dre & the whole jacket on jacket off got old after awhile. Mr Han also takes him to the mountains to continue his training. I have to say that it iis well shot the locations. You have the parents that are high brow just like the original they don't want Dre to hang out with their daughter. & Jackie Chan has this good scene where it's the anniversary of his wife & sons deaths where he's destroying this car & he was mad 1 night & he & his wife were arguing it's pretty good acting by Jackie Chan. Dre apologises to Mei Ying's parents & because he didn't break his promise to be at her recital she'll be at his side at the tournament cause in their family they never break a promise. I didn't care for the slow mo with the fights at the tournament but the fights themselves aren't too bad. Small homage to the original where Dre gets hurt Dre still wants to compete Han uses the fire cupping. Dre battles Chang &  uses a flash kick  to beat him. I didn't care for the alterate ending it felt like it belonged in a action movie. I just like it where the students bow to Mr Han. I thought it ran too long the slow mo during the fights I didn't care for. The soundtrack was bad. But this was a good movie. It doesn't change my opinion on remakes why I don't like & rant on remakes is a good majority have too many homages to the point there a carbon copy & don't stand alone. Harald Zwart did a pretty good job. Jackie Chan was very good. Jaden Smith surprised me I thought he was going to be annoying but he was good. Wen Wen Han was good. Zhenwei Wang was ok he was better than the hammy villains in KKIII. This is better than KKIII definitely.

1312109,A17DCPYMLXV1S4,B002ZG99CC,Kay Shackleton,"[5, 8]","After Jaden Smith completed his role in The Pursuit of Happyness along side his mega-hit father Will Smith, it was assured that Jaden had the chops to join the family business. Jaden's mother is actress Jada Pinkett Smith (currently starring in TNT's ""Hawthorne""). Both parents wanted their son's next major role to fit his abilities and they decided to produce an updated version of The Karate Kid, the smash teen hit in 1984. According to the Smith's, the vision of the film was not complete without securing Jackie Chan to play the role of the boy's mentor and trainer.The Karate Kid, known internationally as The Kung Fu Kid (and perhaps a better title for the film) was shot mostly in China. The plot is identical to the 1984 version: boy moves to strange new town, boy get's bullied, boy get's trained to fight by wise, older martial arts expert, boy seeks revenge and learns many lessons along the way.The Karate Kid, released this weekend , is indeed a film worth viewing even if you are especially fond of the original. It is difficult to remake a film that was as popular as The Karate Kid, but this film accomplishes the task and brings more sophistication to the story than the earlier film. Both of the film's stars do not disappoint. Jaden, believable as the new kid in a strange land, portrays vulnerability when needed and obviously trained for the fighting scenes.Jackie Chan is spot on as the kung fu master and it is a treat to see another side of the actor who normally plays in more comedic films. The Smiths secured an all access pass to China, including a look at the Forbidden City. The cinematography and the film's score were enjoyable and impressive for a film catering to younger viewers and it is nicely cast with Taraji P. Henson portraying the mother and Wenwen Han playing the boy's first love interest.The kung fu scenes are well done but may be too much for smaller children. All in all, this was the perfect movie to be released as school breaks for the summer. It's a film that the target audience will certainly enjoy and their parents will be taken back in time to their first ""Karate Kid"" memories and be glad that their children now have a film of their own.For a look at reviews of films in the theaters not, click here: [...].",5,.Jaden Smith shines as the new Karate Kid,1287705600,"10 22, 2010",2010,2268,"['Jaden', 'Smith', 'completed', 'role', 'Pursuit', 'Happyness', 'side', 'mega-hit', 'father', 'Will', 'Smith', 'was', 'assured', 'Jaden', 'had', 'chops', 'join', 'family', 'business', 'Jaden', 'mother', 'actress', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Smith', 'currently', 'starring', 'TNT', 'Hawthorne', 'parents', 'wanted', 'son', 'next', 'major', 'role', 'fit', 'abilities', 'decided', 'produce', 'updated', 'version', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'smash', 'teen', 'hit', '1984', 'According', 'Smith', 'vision', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'complete', 'securing', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'play', 'role', 'boy', 'mentor', 'trainer.The', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'known', 'internationally', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Kid', 'perhaps', 'better', 'title', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'mostly', 'China', 'plot', 'identical', '1984', 'version', 'boy', 'moves', 'strange', 'new', 'town', 'boy', 'get', 'bullied', 'get', 'trained', 'fight', 'wise', 'older', 'martial', 'arts', 'expert', 'boy', 'seeks', 'revenge', 'many', 'lessons', 'way.The', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'released', 'weekend', 'indeed', 'film', 'viewing', 'even', 'are', 'especially', 'fond', 'original', 'difficult', 'remake', 'film', 'was', 'as', 'popular', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'film', 'task', 'more', 'sophistication', 'story', 'earlier', 'film', 'film', 'stars', 'do', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Jaden', 'believable', 'new', 'kid', 'strange', 'land', 'vulnerability', 'when', 'needed', 'obviously', 'trained', 'fighting', 'scenes.Jackie', 'Chan', 'spot', 'kung', 'fu', 'master', 'treat', 'see', 'side', 'actor', 'who', 'normally', 'more', 'comedic', 'films', 'Smiths', 'secured', 'access', 'pass', 'China', 'including', 'look', 'Forbidden', 'City', 'cinematography', 'film', 'score', 'were', 'enjoyable', 'impressive', 'film', 'catering', 'younger', 'viewers', 'nicely', 'cast', 'Taraji', 'P.', 'Henson', 'portraying', 'mother', 'Wenwen', 'Han', 'playing', 'boy', 'first', 'love', 'interest.The', 'kung', 'fu', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'smaller', 'children', 'was', 'perfect', 'movie', 'be', 'released', 'school', 'breaks', 'summer', 'film', 'target', 'audience', 'will', 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'parents', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'back', 'time', 'first', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'memories', 'be', 'glad', 'children', 'now', 'have', 'film', 'own.For', 'look', 'reviews', 'films', 'theaters', 'not', 'click', 'here', '[', ']']",N/A

1312114,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B002ZG99CC,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[0, 1]","I really enjoyed the 1984 Ralph Macchio/Pat Morita version of THE KARATE KID, so I have to admit I was prejudiced against this remake, expecting that it would be, like most remakes, a fair imitation at best. And having now seen this version, I still like the original better, though Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan both turn in fine performances as student and teacher.This KARATE KID borrows very heavily from the original. The storylines are nearly identical and much of the dialogue is shared. In this version, young Dre (Smith) is an American boy living in China where his mother has been corporately transferred. As the new kid and as a foreigner he runs afoul of the local martial arts thugs who are being taught a debased form of Empty Hand Combat (Kung Fu rather than Karate) by their irrationally hostile teacher.After a particularly savage beating, he is taken under the wing of Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), who proceeds to teach him Kung Fu in order to compete against the thugs in the Juniors Tournament.Mr. Han shares much with Mr. Miyagi of the original film. In a particularly funny sequence he is targeting a fly with chopsticks in his hand, only to unexpectedly squash the fly flat with a swatter instead.  Han, though, is younger than Miyagi, and lacks the air of sagacity (and humor) which so animated Pat Morita's characterization.For his part, Dre, at age twelve, though younger than Ralph Macchio's Daniel LaRusso, is overall, more mature (despite a tendency to drop his clothes on the floor and watch Sponge Bob Squarepants after school).Unlike the original with it's now-famous ""Wax on! Wax off!"" training sessions, most of Dre's early training consists of hanging his jacket up over and over and over again. The problem with this as a muscle memory training technique is that Han doesn't formalize Dre's body movements. The sudden elevation of hanging a coat on a hook into a deadly art form is a bit of a stretch. In order to make up for this contrivance, the film takes us on a visual tour of a beautiful and ancient Chinese Buddhist monastery where Han perfects Dre's fighting skills. Dre, expectedly, wins the tournament.The heart and soul of this version of THE KARATE KID are both far weaker than that of the original film. Although Dre tells Han at one point, ""I love you,"" it's only a line in a script. Dre and Han remain only favored student and teacher and never become, as in the original, surrogate son and father. Mr. Han has none of the emotional draw of Mr. Miyagi. Pat Morita tapped into something profound. Jackie Chan is just acting.THE KARATE KID goes to great lengths to show us that the Chinese are just like us here in America with the same compulsion for consumer goods. To an extent, the filmmakers' intent is to build bridges between China and the United States, and that's all to the good.However, the film is badly unbalanced in its depiction of modern China. The United States that Dre and his mother leave (Detroit) is only briefly seen, and is portrayed as nothing but an ugly crumbling slum while everything in China is presented as bright, shiny, new and wonderful, to an extent that made me wonder if THE KARATE KID was funded by the Propaganda Ministry in Beijing.The film utterly ignores the fact that China is the world's largest totalitarian State with an abysmal record of respecting human rights and a history of subjugating and slaughtering ethnic groups like the Tibetans, and even non-Han Chinese.Further, the film studiously ignores the fact that China has become a hideously polluted, freeway-strangled Los Angeles-like megalopolis in many places. More than one friend (of many who have visited China) asked if they showed us the smog. With a national policy of tearing down virtually all its traditional architecture in favor of concrete and rebar, and the paving over of its land forms, China is an ecological disaster zone.I know this is entertainment not documentary, but the All-China cheerleading that marks this film is very close to completely objectionable. Even the end credits are in Chinese (and English). After all, the studio can't lose that bottom line!""I don't know what they do to the ice cream, but it's so much better here!"" Dre's mother says.

1312121,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B002ZG99CC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 8]","The summer of 2010 version of ""The Karate Kid"" is one of the best remakes I have ever seen.  The best sequel of all time might be on that does not immediately come to mind, namely John Huston's version of ""The Maltese Falcon,"" which was the second or third version of the classic crime novel.  I do not think anybody would dare to remake that one, and fans of the original version of ""The Karate Kid,"" probably feel the same way about the 1984 film.  But I doubt anybody who loves the original is going to be bitterly disappointed with this new one, because there are three significant changes that help make this remake stand on its own carefully poised leg.  The first two are related, in that this time our young hero does not just move across the continent but across the Pacific Ocean when his mom drags him off to China.  That gives us not only a shift in the wise master from Japanese to Chinese heritage, which represents some shifts in culture as Pat Morita's Mr. Miyagi becomes Jackie Chan's Mr. Han, but also means almost all of the film was shot in China, which means some gorgeous vistas filmed by cinematographer Roger Pratt (""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"").  The third factor is that Jayden Smith as young Dre Parker is a pre-teen, which takes the level of the story down to junior high, and he is relatively undersized, so that when this gang of bullies comes after him and keeps coming after him, he looks terrified.  Learning karate, or kung fu, or whatever the most accurate name for this particular brand of martial arts might be, looks to be literally necessary for Dre to keep alive, let alone improve his sense of self-worth or help him with the cute violinist (Han Wen Wen) who is willing to befriend the new kid in town.This is Christopher Murphey's first screenplay credit (he came up with the story for 2001's ""The Unsaid""), and it is really impressive in that it is respectful of the original Robert Mark Kamen story without treating it with undue reverence.  The story beats are all from the original movie, but Murphey's script comes up with new variations, so that nothing is repeated.  The least successful of these is the bit with the shirt that takes the place of the great ""wax on, wax off"" sequence that probably earned Pat Morita his Supporting Actor Oscar nomination.  But others changes are more successful, ranging from the subtle gag involving catching a fly with chopsticks to the new and more dramatic significance of the car the master has been restoring.  I wonder how much credit Murphey gets for getting this remake to work, but I also suspect Jaden Smith's parents, both of whom have producer credits for the film, played significant roles in making sure this was a high class product.  There are lots of snap shouts of the proud parents in the end credits, which are in both English and what I assume is Mandarin.  Credit also goes to Jackie Chan, who once again shows that he is the Fred Astaire of martial arts films in his ability to make use of what is there, such as a windbreaker, in the early fight sequence.  It takes a while in this film before you really recognize Jackie Chan as Jackie Chan, mainly because it takes a long time for a smile to crack his lips, or, more importantly, for that tell-tale glint to show up in his eye.  There are people who love Chan and those who find his persona annoying, but I think both of those groups will be impressed with his performance here.I round up on this one because of the way the end game plays out this time around.  Working off of Smith's small frame, Dre comes up with an additional reason for why he has to show up for the final match, thereby tying things together nicely.  More importantly, all of the lip service to winning and losing not being important actually plays out in the big match, where Dre is so totally in the moment that those words become flesh.  That is probably the most significant addition to this version, and hopefully youngsters will pick up on the message and not just be enthralled with the thought of learning kung fun and/or visiting China.  I also anticipated and approved that the movie goes a bit farther than the original, coming up with its own way of adding a coda that we did not get with the original until the beginning of ""The Karate Kid II.""  So, even if you know ""what"" is going to happen, you still get to enjoy the ""how.""  I went to this movie with someone who has yet to see the original, and I am not sure which one of us enjoyed the film more.

I felt they went too far, were definitely beyond a PG rating, and weren't needed to establish the character's motive for learning kung fu. I kept wondering 'where are the adults?' I also felt that the 'bad' kung fu school was a bit overdone, and kind of offensive.

1312124,A17O9AHKHK66AI,B002ZG99CC,L. Gildart,"[0, 0]","I'll try to avoid spoilers to the extent possible, but there may be some minor ones in terms of how the film relates to the original.First thing:  this remake actually is a remake, as opposed to a re-imagining.  I wouldn't call it reverent, but it is, at least, faithful.  Some of the details and plot points are different, and some of the differences are significant.  But this movie IS The Karate Kid.  Even though it's kung fu.  And even though it's in China.  And even though it is of this time, not that time (although, if you do a side-by-side comparison of the films, it becomes apparent how similar the zeitgeist of the Bush years was to that of the Reagan years).Second:  adding Jackie Chan to the mix does nothing to add to the martial arts mentor genre, since he has already done Drunken Master, in which he is the student, and Forbidden Kingdom, in which he and Jet Li are the teachers. The fight choreography is better in both of those movies, even though the latter makes extensive use of wire fighting, and the cinematography for the fight scenes is much more precise.  In fact, the fight choreography and cinematography for this movie is not as good as a lot of martial arts films, many, if not most, of which are Jackie Chan films.  However, the movie as a whole is just gorgeous.  Beautifully shot.  And the acting is excellent.  The girl who plays Dre's crush/puppy love interest is adorable. And the boy who plays the nemesis is thoroughly menacing when confronting Dre but transitions seamlessly to innocent in front of the school principal.I deducted one star, because the movie is too long by as much as half an hour, which isn't as big a deal watching at home, where you can pause the film, and because I had a hard time with how young the kids are in this remake.  Maybe there was a message in there somewhere related to their ages?  But if there was, it wasn't clear to me.  And seeing tweens - as opposed to older teens/young adults - harming each other was disturbing.

So what better time than now to take that story and make it something just a little bit different?THE KARATE KID is not a remake of that classic film starring Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita. Instead the film makers have decided to take the thin outline of a plot and turn it into something new, something a bit original. The fights, the teenage love story and the relationship between teacher and student are there, but this film changes enough to make it not the original.Jaden Smith stars a Dre Parker, a young boy whose mother has just taken a job in Beijing, China.  Leaving their home in Detroit for the great unknown, Dre isn't quite sure how to adapt to his new location at first. Making a friend with another transplanted young boy, Dre eventually goes down to the playground near his house. There he meets Meiying, a young Chinese girl practicing her violin in the park. But before a friendship can begin, another boy who fancies Meiying takes a poke at Dre.Cheng, the class bully, faces off against Dre and easily takes him down. Using martial arts techniques Dre is unfamiliar with, he is ridiculed in front of his new friend and ends up going home bruised and beaten.The bullying continues until Dre sees a chance and tosses a bucket of slop water on the bully and his friends. After a chase through the back alleys, they end up near Dre's home but not close enough for him to get away. Another beating follows but as Cheng is about to punch the fallen Dre one more time he is stopped by Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), the building superintendent.With more moves than the group of boys can handle, Mr. Han easily disposes of the group. After taking care of Dre, a discussion follows in which Mr. Han states that there are no bad students, just bad teachers. He then suggests that Dre state his case to their teacher and ask for peace. But Dre has already seen their teaching style of no pain, no mercy. When Mr. Han accompanies Dre to the dojo, he learns what the teacher is like and rather than allow Dre to be beaten non-stop, offers to accept a martial arts tournament challenge rather with the school as long as the bullying stops.So much for the set up. Now it's up to Han to teach Dre how to defend himself. But Han doesn't look at kung fu as a way to defeat someone. He looks at it as an art form, a way to insure peace rather than war. And Dre must learn that as well, the heart of the form as well as the moves. The training is slow going and Dre doesn't recognize that he is even being taught. That changes and he begins to understand better as well as become accomplished in what Han is trying to teach him, eventually preparing him for the final battle.On this journey of self discovery Dre also finds time to find his first big romance and learn about respect as well. He matures as the story moves forward and comes to realize that winning isn't the only thing.With the exception in the change of locale making Dre not just a transplant from one part of the U.S. to another, he faces total change not only in language but in culture as well. He discovers that perhaps he's not as all that as he thinks he is and changes both physically and mentally.Jaden Smith does a fine job as young Dre, showing an acting ability that comes from his own talents and not totally from his parents (Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith). His portrayal is believable and well done. Jackie Chan also shines giving a performance that many will be stunned by. Normally the comedic fall guy in most of his films, Chan has a chance at a real dramatic role here with one of the most touching scenes in the film relating to his past.No, this film is not a remake of the original. It has its own feel, its own pacing and its own style. The film has taken a skeleton of a story and placed muscle and flesh on it. This is not your father's KARATE KID.

1312137,A8ZY9LI1KBU2P,B002ZG99CC,Mary Kate,"[75, 91]","When I read that there was going to be a remake of the 1984 film The Karate Kid, I smiled in fond recollection of the original (which was a great family favorite in our house) and was interested in seeing the new version because it was being shot in China - a country (and a culture) about which I feel I have a LOT to learn.  I was looking forward to seeing it.The results? A mixed bag. Since I generally prefer to judge a remake on its own merits and try to avoid making too many comparisons to the original, I was somewhat surprised that, after seeing Karate Kid 2010, ALL I was doing was making comparisons in my head - comparisons in which the new version kept coming up short. Annoyed with myself, I decided to watch the 1984 version again to make certain it wasn't just nostalgia that was coloring my opinion. So I re-watched. It wasn't just nostalgia - the original IS better.The Karate Kid 1984 wasn't the best written or best acted film ever - or even of 1984. But it was very popular. Kids liked it. Their parents liked it. People saw it multiple times. They quoted from it (""wax on, wax off""). Some, including my own kids, still do. :-) Enrollment at karate schools across the country rose dramatically. What really came home to me during my back-to-back viewing of the two films is that the new version simply lacks much of the heart and most of the humor that formed the basis for that initial popularity. And both of those - the heart and the humor - came, IMO, from the wonderful relationship between Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) and Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita). While the plot of the remake closely follows the original, the new film never comes close to capturing the essence of that relationship and so failed to engage me in the same manner the original did.But while I didn't find the heart and humor in The Karate Kid 2010 that would have given me that ""absolutely love it"" feeling, the film has its own charms and I was able to enjoy it on its own merits, particularly in a couple of areas where it clearly outclasses the original, such as:* The athleticism of its stars (Jaden Smith as Dre Parker, Jackie Chan as Mr. Han & Zhenwie Wang as the bully, Cheng). Jaden Smith, even at age 11, has more muscle definition than Ralph Macchio had at twice his age (or possibly ever) and is physically much more convincing as a student who could master difficult martial arts moves in a short space of time. Chan and Wang (Wang particularly) are also more convincing athletically than their counterparts.* The vastly superior fight scenes. Each and every fight scene is better ""choreographed"" and much more interesting to watch. (They are also more violent - parents might want to see the film before taking children under the age of 10 or so.)* Dre's friendship with the violin prodigy Meiying (Wenwen Han). Even as a dedicated fan of Elisabeth Shue (the love interest in the original film), I found the Dre/Meiying relationship more appealing. I probably would have enjoyed their storyline more if the writers had simply left it platonic and concentrated on the cultural differences between them to create some tension, but their relationship made possible one of my favorite moments in the film: the scene where Dre goes to Meiying's home and addresses a formal apology to her father in Chinese. I also loved the violin piece she played.* The gorgeous scenery. Views of China including the Great Wall, the Forbidden City and a mountaintop temple were simply stunning. (Those interested in seeing more of China might want to check outWild China: Natural Wonders of the World's Most Enigmatic Land).* And, lastly, the ancient healing method? MUCH cooler in the new film.Both films have a collection of underlying messages that they effectively deliver - that violence is not the answer, that there is honor is being a peacemaker, that bullies often learn their ways from others and, most meaningful to me personally, that children (or anyone for that matter) should never have to live in fear.

The black American child being beaten mercilessly by Chinese boys is total nonsense.  As if the five thousand years of civilization of China are washed down the drain by its arrogant and ruthless youth and teachers portrayed by moviemakers bent on lies.  Aside from the emaciated body of the American child that defies Newton's law of inertia in imparting any harmful kinetic energy, or the feminine look of the child that makes it hard to tell whether it was a boy or a girl, it would be mere exaggeration to imagine that a group of well-trained athletic kids lack any courage in beating up a defenseless and lone alien.Somehow a high class and wealthy Chinese family could afford a private tutor to polish their daughter's artistic skill, yet venture into letting her attend public school, with presumably bad kids, yet fear the bad influence of the lone alien and charismatic one.Getting to the nitty-gritty of developing muscular strength, the chosen child definitely lacks any maturity to develop muscle mass or tone to ward off hostility. All the fake stunts were clearly and foolishly camouflaged to cover up on the poor choice of actors.Lecturing on the glorious landscape of China would not put Newton's laws to work. Nor was the dramatic and circumstantial grieve of the maintenance man, on the loss of his family, fitting the narration.Nowhere in the movie I could discern how the Chinese did not confuse the long beads of the child for girl's hair or how the Kung Fu kids spoke fluent English. Assuming that children could act as a pack of wolves devouring their prey, it is hard to believe that all the Chinese bystanders were so ruthless to let an alien child left behind on the pavement, beaten up to collapse.The most irritating segment of the movie was the constant hiding of the moves during the Kung Fu contest when the only alien black American contender was fighting kids who were much heavier, taller, and older than her or him.  If such brief training could get that far, then the Chinese need to learn to take a hike?There is nothing in life of moviemakers that is more meaningful, real, or positive than taking a feeble black kid and faking her super-human power in defeating the well trained athletes in their homeland, provided that the moviemakers hire the best fabricators to make the clips sound convincing?

Despite following in the footsteps of the other Karate Kid movies, it had something different.  After seeing it, I still feel the same way.  I liked it.Dre and his mother move to China when she is transferred for her job.  Right away Dre starts getting picked on by the local boys when they think he gets to close to a local girl.  Discouraged, and in the middle of getting beat up yet again, he is rescued by the maintenance man at the apartments who manages to fight five other people.  When tensions are raised, he takes on Dre and trains him to fight in a competition.  But there will be some fierce competition to overcome.Characters:Jackie Chan: Mr. HanJaden Smith: Dre ParkerTaraji P. Henson: Sherry ParkerWewen Han: Mei YingZhenwei Wang: ChengYu Rongguang: Master LiI think the characters were really well cast.  Jackie Chan especially did a great job.  Jaden was ok but he over acted in some parts I thought.  The rest of the characters were well done too, but they tended to go to the extremes as far as good, evil, etc.  Master Li was an especially evil character.  I did find Dre's mother a little annoying as well.I thought overall the premise of the movie was good.  It had some cultural issues revealed and handled them truthfully but gently as well.  I also like how they had Mr. Han teach Dre Kung fu.  The jacket thing was funny but useful at the same time.  There were some beautiful scenes in this movie as well.  I liked that there were many shots of China and the different things there.  The music was pretty good as well.  It was a mix between English and Chinese but there was always a good beat to it.Not too bad.  It can definitely stand up there with the other movies no problem.

I approached this with no small degree of trepidation, since the original had a special place in my memory from my younger days, and I had the horrible feeling that a remake would just be more of the same but without Pat Morita and with a predictable dose of sweetener in it.  But I was wrong - the story has been sufficiently given a new dimension by setting it in China, meaning the theme of the outsider being shunned is all the more relevant.  Also Kung Fu is somehow a more appropriate martial art than Karate.  The biggest and best surprise is in the casting - Jaden Smith is more than ever a mini-Will Smith with all the charisma that implies, but it is Jackie Chan that is quite a revelation, genuinely acting and emoting in a believable way, without his usual tongue in cheek approach.  The end result is a genuine and quite affecting story with believable characters, which nods to the original in a satisfying way, without ever treading the same ground too obviously - no `wax on, wax off' here, but a novel alternative instead.  It's a little grittier than the original, in a way that helps sell the danger in a more believable way, but leavens it with just enough heart to keep it in PG realm.Yes it is not going to hold any big surprises for you, but if you're half human you're going to find it at least a little heart warming, and if it suffers a little from being somewhat of a Tourism Board approved advert for China at times, well it's beautiful enough scenery to forgive.  It's arguably better than the original in many ways, better written, better fight choreography and some better ideas - but I wonder if even with all that going for it, it struggles to match the teacher - pupil chemistry of the original .

I mean I've heard that it had some great views of China, but I don't see what they're talking about at all, there's nothing worth noting.2. Jackie Chan....has no charisma. I'm sorry but he will never look or sound as wise as Pat Morita as Mr. Miyagi. Jackie Chan also comes off as a pedophile IMO. Some scenes were a bit awkward. Something is unsettling when a grown up man is screaming at a 12 year? old boy to ""take it off!"", ""put it on!"" , ""take it down!"". I know I'm probably inserting a thought that wasn't really intended by the movie, but the lines don't work with the likes of Jackie Chan. Mr. Miyagi is much better in this role because he just seems like a nice grandfather like figure. Jackie Chan just doesn't suit that role. Jackie Chan's acting in this movie IMO is not that good. I find his acting to be highly unconvincing and the part where he cried in the car about his family just left me trying to keep myself from laughing instead of actually feeling bad as it did in the original.3. I am not too fond of Will Smith's son. He just looks too much like a ghetto hoodlum with abnormally large ears. I am highly fond of the dad, I'm just having problems getting my eyes adjusted to his kid. I don't appreciate his hair style, it doesn't look good on him IMO. He doesn't look like a nice kid, he looks like a little thug wanna be, which is another reason why I find it hard to cheer him on. The scene near the end, he looks a lot like his dad!4. Pray to god that the little girl in the movie that's attached to the main character grows up to be as hott as her mom.5. There is no feeling of attachment to the character or the story. Because of the above thought, I find it hard to side with Smith or Chan in this movie. Chan just looks like he's trying too hard. He will never have the kind of charm and charisma as Pat.6. Dre's mom is pretty hott but am I the only one that thinks the clothes she usually wears in this movie is a bit flashy? Hopefully she did not go all the way to China to become a......7. The take-jacket-off-put-it-back-on method that Jackie Chan uses to teach Smith is too bogus. I mean it might teach him some techniques, but in order to block quick consecutive attacks, you need much more. You need actual fighting experience otherwise everyone around the world would just use that technique to teach instead....So in general, this movie is alright but I don't appreciate this remake much. Love the dad, hopefully one day the son will be at least half as good. The do like the ending fight scenes a bit more, but there just seems to be some gaps in the plot, especially when compared side by side to the old version.",2,What The Blank Is This.....,1278201600,"07 4, 2010",2010,2855,"['movie', 'Will', 'Smith', 'adaptation', 'old', 'karate', 'kid', 'However', 'here', 'are', 'random', 'thoughts:1', ""'m"", 'watching', 'see', 'reason', 'why', 'anyone', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'watch', 'theater', 'mean', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'had', 'great', 'views', 'China', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', ""'re"", 'talking', 'nothing', 'worth', 'noting.2', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'charisma', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'will', 'never', 'look', 'sound', 'as', 'wise', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'also', 'off', 'pedophile', 'IMO', 'scenes', 'were', 'bit', 'awkward', 'Something', 'unsettling', 'when', 'grown', 'up', 'man', 'screaming', '12', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'take', 'off', 'put', 'take', 'down', 'know', ""'m"", 'probably', 'inserting', 'thought', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'intended', 'movie', 'lines', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'likes', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'much', 'better', 'role', 'just', 'nice', 'grandfather', 'figure', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'just', ""n't"", 'suit', 'role', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'acting', 'movie', 'IMO', 'not', 'good', 'find', 'acting', 'be', 'highly', 'unconvincing', 'part', 'where', 'cried', 'car', 'family', 'just', 'left', 'trying', 'keep', 'laughing', 'instead', 'actually', 'feeling', 'bad', 'did', 'original.3', 'am', 'not', 'too', 'fond', 'Will', 'Smith', 'son', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'ghetto', 'hoodlum', 'abnormally', 'large', 'ears', 'am', 'highly', 'fond', 'dad', ""'m"", 'just', 'having', 'problems', 'getting', 'eyes', 'adjusted', 'kid', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'hair', 'style', ""n't"", 'look', 'good', 'IMO', ""n't"", 'look', 'nice', 'kid', 'little', 'thug', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'reason', 'why', 'find', 'hard', 'cheer', 'scene', 'end', 'lot', 'dad', '4', 'Pray', 'god', 'little', 'girl', 'movie', 'attached', 'main', 'character', 'up', 'be', 'as', 'hott', 'mom.5', 'feeling', 'attachment', 'character', 'story', 'above', 'thought', 'find', 'hard', 'side', 'Smith', 'Chan', 'movie', 'Chan', 'just', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'kind', 'charm', 'charisma', 'Pat.6', 'Dre', 'mom', 'pretty', 'hott', 'am', 'only', 'one', 'clothes', 'usually', 'movie', 'bit', 'flashy', 'Hopefully', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'way', 'China', 'become', '7', 'take-jacket-off-put-it-back-on', 'method', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'teach', 'Smith', 'too', 'bogus', 'mean', 'might', 'teach', 'techniques', 'order', 'block', 'quick', 'consecutive', 'attacks', 'need', 'much', 'more', 'need', 'actual', 'fighting', 'experience', 'otherwise', 'everyone', 'world', 'would', 'just', 'use', 'technique', 'teach', 'instead', '.So', 'general', 'movie', 'alright', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'remake', 'much', 'Love', 'dad', 'hopefully', 'one', 'day', 'son', 'will', 'be', 'least', 'half', 'good', 'do', 'ending', 'fight', 'scenes', 'bit', 'more', 'there', 'just', 'be', 'gaps', 'plot', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'side', 'side', 'old', 'version']",N/A

The original is a classic that still holds up today and it didn't need a remake. Then when I heard it was produced by Will Smith and that his son was starring in it I hated it even more. Then when I heard it would be called ""The Karate Kid"" but be set in China where they do Kung Fu I REALLY hated it! But, I gave it a chance and watched it and I actually really loved it. All of the acting is great. I hate to say it but Jaden Smith is actually a pretty good actor. And his fight scenes all looked great. And Jackie Chan is just fantastic. This is one of the best roles he has ever played. All the fight choreography is brilliant. Much better than most American martial arts movies. And the cinematography of China is BEAUTIFUL!I'm giving this 4 out of 5 for a couple of reasons. 1) I think Jaden Smith was too young for the part. I think they should have waited a couple more years to do the film. It just wasn't very believable that an official tournament would let these older looking boys beat up on a 12 year old and nearly break his leg. Jaden should have been at least 14 before doing this. And 2) the movie should have been called ""The Kung Fu Kid"" NOT ""Karate Kid"" since they're not doing Karate. It makes no sense other than they just wanted to sell tickets. They could have called it ""Kung Fu Kid"" and still paid homage to ""Karate Kid."" But those are the only two things that bothered me in this otherwise great movie.I can see this movie being just as special for kids today as the ""Karate Kid"" was for me when I was a child.",4,Surprisingly good!

After the original ended, I was so happy with it that I had little faith that the remake would be nearly as good. I'm even happier to say that I believe this new version is slightly better. I know many will not agree, because they grew up on the original and it's such a major offense to challenge that nostalgia. I'm sorry. I didn't grow up with the original, and I like them both almost equally. I really felt the bond that developed between Dre Parker (Smith) and Mr. Han (Chan). Jackie Chan surprised me in this dramatic role. I mean, he cried! Jackie Chan freaking cried! And it was believable how heartfelt his character moments were. I certainly gained a new respect for him as an actor. Jaden Smith did a little bit of crying himself, and guess what, he was believable too. I do not quite get why everyone hates the kid just because he was born into a perfect life. He has genuine acting talent. And his coaches couldn't be better.Yes the acting was superb, in my opinion, with the exception of the girl that Dre liked. She was not bad, but she wasn't good either. As for the story, I liked it. I liked a lot. In fact, as a remake, I understand the core elements are identical, but the set up was much better in this one.

1312165,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B002ZG99CC,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","Two questions arise while watching the 2010 version of ""The Karate Kid"": #1) Why is anyone remaking a film that is only twenty-six years old, that has been readily available on video for decades, and that has no special effects that might be improved by contemporary CGI technology? And #2) Why is any version of ""The Karate Kid"" allowed to run for 140 minutes?! I've seen toga-wrapped historical epics that didn't take this long to tell their stories.Though the setting has been moved from the San Fernando Valley to Beijing, it's still the same old hooey about the puny, put-upon newcomer who receives lessons in self-defense, discipline and life from an inscrutable maintenance man who just happens to be a kung fu master. I guess the Chinese setting is supposed to work to legitimize the two-bit philosophizing that pours forth in endless fashion from this unpolished Henry Higgins, but it also makes this simple tale much more pretentious in the long run - Dre's photogenically performing his martial arts moves on the top of the Great Wall of China being the prime example of that.Jaden Smith, son of Will Smith and co-star of ""The Pursuit of Happyness,"" plays the twelve-year-old who moves from Detroit to China with his mother shortly after the death of his father. Indeed, the young Smith is probably the only decent thing in the movie. He manages to be both lively and likable without coming across as cutesy and cloying. After Dre immediately falls victim to the local bullies, he seeks help from Mr. Han, the handyman in the apartment where he lives. There's really no point in reiterating any more of the plot, since everyone knows it already, because, even if you haven't seen the actual original, you surely know it by instinct.As the wise but taciturn Mr. Han, Jackie Chan brings nowhere near the humor or charm to the role that the scene-stealing Pat Morita did when it was known as Mr. Miyagi.It's true that the scenery here is a little more impressive than what one finds in Reseda, but that's not enough to justify the time and money spent on this musty, overlong and wholly unnecessary remake.",2,Turgid remake of a once modest film,1313625600,"08 18, 2011",2011,2114,"['Two', 'questions', 'arise', 'watching', '2010', 'version', 'Karate', 'Kid', '1', 'Why', 'anyone', 'remaking', 'film', 'only', 'twenty-six', 'years', 'old', 'been', 'readily', 'available', 'video', 'decades', 'special', 'effects', 'might', 'be', 'improved', 'contemporary', 'CGI', 'technology', '2', 'Why', 'version', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'allowed', 'run', '140', 'minutes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'toga-wrapped', 'historical', 'epics', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'tell', 'stories.Though', 'setting', 'been', 'moved', 'San', 'Fernando', 'Valley', 'Beijing', 'still', 'same', 'old', 'hooey', 'puny', 'put-upon', 'newcomer', 'who', 'lessons', 'self-defense', 'discipline', 'life', 'inscrutable', 'maintenance', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'kung', 'fu', 'master', 'guess', 'Chinese', 'setting', 'supposed', 'work', 'legitimize', 'two-bit', 'philosophizing', 'forth', 'endless', 'fashion', 'unpolished', 'Henry', 'Higgins', 'also', 'simple', 'tale', 'much', 'more', 'pretentious', 'long', 'run', 'Dre', 'photogenically', 'performing', 'martial', 'arts', 'moves', 'top', 'Great', 'Wall', 'China', 'being', 'prime', 'example', 'that.Jaden', 'Smith', 'son', 'Will', 'Smith', 'co-star', 'Pursuit', 'Happyness', 'twelve-year-old', 'who', 'Detroit', 'China', 'mother', 'shortly', 'death', 'father', 'Indeed', 'young', 'Smith', 'probably', 'only', 'decent', 'thing', 'movie', 'be', 'lively', 'likable', 'coming', 'cutesy', 'cloying', 'Dre', 'immediately', 'victim', 'local', 'bullies', 'help', 'Mr.', 'Han', 'handyman', 'apartment', 'where', 'really', 'point', 'reiterating', 'more', 'plot', 'everyone', 'already', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'actual', 'original', 'surely', 'know', 'instinct.As', 'wise', 'taciturn', 'Mr.', 'Han', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'nowhere', 'humor', 'charm', 'role', 'scene-stealing', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'known', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi.It', 'true', 'scenery', 'here', 'little', 'more', 'impressive', 'what', 'one', 'Reseda', 'not', 'enough', 'justify', 'time', 'money', 'spent', 'musty', 'overlong', 'wholly', 'unnecessary', 'remake']",N/A

1312169,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B002ZG99CC,Sean Pasek,"[2, 6]","Along with thousands of other people, I was very hesitant about seeing this movie.  I had seen the original after all, and with Hollywood's obsession with remakes, I figured that this one would fall along the way-side like so many others.  Usually when a remake is done, it's best to create anew.  Come up with your own story and make it work.  Usually when remake is done like the original, it nearly always fails.  This is one of those rare times when it doesn't fail.Anyone who has seen the original version will find very few, if any, surprises.  The story is virtually identical.  However, the movie both fails and succeeds in this regard.  I mean, come on, can anyone truly top Daniel's kick at the end of the original film?  Doubtful.  However, one of the things that I loved better about this film, was that it takes place in China.  I felt that this was a slick move by the writers.  But the true strength of this film rests in its performers.Dre Parker's mother lands a job in Beijing, China.  So, they move.  Dre has no idea about where is going despite persistence from his mother to try and learn the language.  Day one shows up, and mesmerized by young Meiying who is an aspiring violinist.  Cheng, the school bully, steps in when he sees Dre becoming friends with her, and here the trouble starts.I'm going to say it right here...Jaden Smith is already an accomplished actor.  This young man has got an incredibly bright future ahead of him.  He holds his own on screen with Jackie Chan and everyone else.  He makes us feel sympathetic to his character's plight.  Unlike Daniel from the original film, Dre Parker is about half the size of the kids who are picking on him.  At first, he tries in vain to put up a fight.  Another area where Jaden excels is in his range of emotions.  There is a touching scene with Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), in which Jaden captures the hearts of the audience, if hasn't done so already.  I'm curious about how much time and training it took for Jaden to demonstrate some martial arts prowess.  I'll just say, for people who haven't seen the film yet, the skill level is high, and you will see some very fast and exciting moves in this film, which frankly, is superior to the original.  However one question must be raised about how quickly a student can absorb all of this knowledge and apply it.  However, is is passable even if questionable.This is the first time I've seen Jackie Chan in a serious role.  His challenge is greater than Jaden's because in the original film, Pat Morita was the heart and soul of the ""Karate Kid"" movies as the wise sage, Mr. Miyagi.  This was the one area where I had the biggest doubts about.  Over the years, I've heard people mention Mr. Miyagi in the same breath as Yoda.  That's how much impact he had on the audience.  Mr. Miyagi wasn't just teaching Daniel about martial arts, but also about life, and how martial arts is about achieving a physical harmony and balance.  I must say that Jackie Chan did a respectable job, and even a very good one.  I still prefer Pat Morita, but Chan was very good too.  The same thoughts go into Dre's training...that this isn't just martial arts training, but life training.  We sense that Mr. Han's past has haunted him more than the past seems to have haunted Mr. Miyagi, and this aspect is actually quite touching; especially a scene involving Dre and Mr. Han.  The tragic aspect to Mr. Han's life is explored a bit more deeply than Mr. Miyagi's, which adds depth and a very real human quality to the character.Dre's first, and perhaps only true friend, is Meiying played beautifully by Wenwen Han.  She and Jaden Smith have a wonderful on-screen chemistry that works for the film very well.  There isn't quite the tension that existed in the original film between Daniel and Ali, but then the ages of Dre and Meiying is about 12-years-old.  Part of Dre's education is learning about cultural differences, and one area where he gets into trouble regarding Meiying.The visuals in this movie are wonderful.  The cinematography as we are treated to spectacular views of the Great Wall, some of the dense forests, and mountainous terrain are breath-taking.  Perhaps one of my favorite scenes in the entire film comes when Mr. Han takes Dre to a mountain temple (you'll recognize this as the same one used in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") where various Chinese students and masters are engaged in practicing martial arts.As I said, the major drawback for this movie, is that if you have seen the original, you'll be treated to very few surprises.  Even some of the dialogue is the same in some areas.  However, had the original movie never been made, I feel that this film would easily stand on its own feet without being caught in the shadows of the original.  I feel that much of the negative feedback that this movie is getting is unjustified.  It is a fun movie, with great performances, and even touching ones.So, if you haven't seen the original film, or you haven't seen the original film in a while, see this one first.  Without the expectations, you might give this film more credence than you might otherwise.  If you have seen the original many times, just as I have, try not to over-analyze it.  You know the story.  You know the routine.  So, try to simply enjoy it for what it is, rather than what it is not.  As far as remakes go, this is one of the best ones done, in my opinion.  I think you will be as pleasantly surprised as I was at how well done this move is, as well as taking note of a talent on the rise...Jaden Smith.",4,"Much Better Than I Expected...This ""Karate Kid""

However, my mother kept gushing over the film and telling me how good it was, even though she knows I don't get into action films that don't have race cars. Finally I gave in and watched it.

I remember him being cute in ""Pursuit of Happyness,"" but I wasn't prepared for his dance skills, his very convincing flirtatious nature with his ""like"" interest Wenwen Han (who plays Meiying), the look on his face when he was fighting Zhenwei Wang (who plays Cheng) or his comedic timing. If not for Jaden Smith having those extras, this would've been one boring film. Cheng and his crew had a butt whooping due to them long ago, but the teacher was so out of hand I could understand why they were so aggressive. And by the way, Zhenwei Wang did an EXCELLENT job of being the villain. He was way too good at that role.

Try to make it through this one without rolling your eyes constantly - I dare you.The problem with this movie is that it didn't need to exist. Every character, every aspect, every shot, every line of dialogue in this film is inferior to the original. It truly feels like this exists only to make money and get Will Smith's son in a movie. Jaden isn't bad, at least not compared to the other actors who are absolutely dreadful - the children, at least. The bullies are as cardboard as it gets, and Jaden's love interest is also bland. They all speak English, but it's so bad that they're hard to understand, and acting in a foreign language isn't like acting in your native language - and these kids are terrible when attempting to act in English.Bad acting aside, there are plenty of over things to despise as well. The movie is virtually a shot for shot remake of the original, except they added a Chinese twist to everything. Make no mistake, though, if it existed in the original it exists in the remake - just in a really bad way. The karate is also absolutely ridiculous. It's comical the things these kids can do. 12 year olds doing kicks that send each other flying 20 feet, and how many 12 year olds get their butt kicked and don't cry? Yeah, right. Also, the idea that a bunch of 12 year olds would attack a full grown man who obviously knows more Kung-Fu than them is laughable. It made sense in the original. They were all in high school. But Chinese children attacking a man? Please...it's incredibly unbelievable.The movie is lousy, and I wanted to like it. I hoped it would be a unique take on the story - it's not.

It feels too slick, Jaden Smith comes across as too cocky and the `romance' doesn't seem realistic enough either. Perhaps the biggest flaw is that this is actually a Kung Fu movie and to call it `Karate Kid' is a blatant cash in on the previous franchise and shows a lack of courage on behalf of the producers. This is also highly disrespectful to both martial arts.The story stays pretty close to the original premise. Kid moves to a new town (only this time it's in China), gets beaten up by bullies, enters tournament to overcome his adversaries and gets trained by a quiet maintenance man who shows the deeper side to martial arts. Jackie Chan is really good as the Sensei but he is no Mr Miyagi! He comes across as a lot more dishevelled, but is still endearing in his own way.It is worth noting that the sets and scenery in China are breathtaking and the fights scenes themselves seem especially well choreographed. If you haven't seen the original film then this will be perfectly good entertainment and the story is as timeless as ever. But, if you have seen the original this may well leave you feeling slightly disappointed and frustrated. This is good in it's own right and may have had more credibility if the producers had had the courage to stand this apart from the original film and marketed it on it's own merits rather than trying to tie it into a cult film loved by many.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",4,The Karate Kid (The Kung Fu Kid),1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,1650,"['Karate', 'Kid', 'credible', 'remake', 'eighties', 'classic', 'whilst', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'flaws.For', 'reason', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'heartwarming', 'original', 'too', 'slick', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'too', 'cocky', 'romance', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realistic', 'enough', 'either', 'Perhaps', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'actually', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'movie', 'call', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'blatant', 'cash', 'previous', 'franchise', 'lack', 'courage', 'behalf', 'producers', 'also', 'highly', 'disrespectful', 'martial', 'arts.The', 'story', 'pretty', 'close', 'original', 'premise', 'Kid', 'new', 'town', 'only', 'time', 'China', 'beaten', 'up', 'bullies', 'enters', 'tournament', 'overcome', 'adversaries', 'trained', 'quiet', 'maintenance', 'man', 'who', 'deeper', 'side', 'martial', 'arts', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'really', 'good', 'Sensei', 'Mr', 'Miyagi', 'across', 'lot', 'more', 'dishevelled', 'still', 'endearing', 'own', 'way.It', 'worth', 'noting', 'sets', 'scenery', 'China', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'fights', 'scenes', 'seem', 'especially', 'well', 'choreographed', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'film', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'perfectly', 'good', 'entertainment', 'story', 'as', 'timeless', 'ever', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'may', 'well', 'leave', 'feeling', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'frustrated', 'good', 'own', 'right', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'credibility', 'producers', 'had', 'had', 'courage', 'stand', 'apart', 'original', 'film', 'marketed', 'own', 'merits', 'rather', 'trying', 'tie', 'cult', 'film', 'loved', 'many.Feel', 'free', 'check', 'out', 'blog', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'profile', 'page']",N/A

It is the quality of the discs audio and video that is a deciding factor for me, though interesting extras such as deleted scenes, extended versions and such are also important.I found that this very fine remake of the Karate Kid film to be just that, an engrossing film that, while not quite containing the intrigue of the original, never the less stands on its own.  In the original the bullies were ever present.  In this remake, they disappear after the beginning of the film and only reappear at the film's finale.  The whole of the film is in Jackie Chans training of his new student. That's as much of the story line as you will get from me.The video quality itself is very good, not excellent, but very good.  Beautifully shot but the cinematography wisely avoided having the colors pop too much so that you don't feel you are watching a cartoon.  The audio quality is almost entirely on the center speaker.  The front left and right channels are used only for the musical score and rarely are the rear surround or front left and right channels used for any of the foley effects.  I said rarely, not never.

1312187,A2LDBZRI5GQ4N,B002ZG99CC,Tech Guy,"[1, 2]","To be honest, when I saw the trailer for the The Karate Kid re-make, I immediately rolled my eyes. I thought to myself after seeing the trailer ""Why are they re-making this movie? What's the point?"" Well, after seeing the re-make and watching the original again, I have to add my two cents about the re-make.Both movies are a fish out of water story; Dre (Jaden Smith) moves to China from Detroit because his mother's job requires re-location. Dre try's to understand the culture, and wants to fit in. It's like going to a different school in another city or state and trying to make new friends, while learning about what is presented before you. Of course, like the original, Dre gets into a confrontation with the school bully, who unfortunately knows Kung Fu and Dre does not. Dre is a tough kid who has street smarts, but he is also kind, understanding, and he does not back down from a challenge. Daniel is a strong teen, his mother re-located from New Jersey out to the Valley in California because of a job. Daniel is tough and strong, but he kind of borders on being the good guy and is very close to going to the dark side. He's also kind and generous, and will tell you how he feels about something. Dre is the same exact way, but the age difference is where these two characters differ; Dre is a young kid, and Daniel is a teen in high school. When your a kid, if you get into a fight, you proved yourself that you will fight back whether you win or lose, and that you don't back down; if you lose a fight, your pride as a kid is stung, but time progresses. When your a teen in high school, it's put up or shut up.Eventually, Dre meets up with Mr. Hahn (Jackie Chan) who is a maintenance man who works in the building; Mr. Hahn is a shut-in who doesn't talk to anybody; he keeps his pain inside, and prefers to be alone. Like the first movie, Mr. Hahn lost his wife and son, very much like Mr. Miyagi except that Mr. Miyagi lost his wife when she was in labor with their son, and both characters died, and Mr. Hahn lost his wife and son in a car accident when Mr. Hahn was driving and he lost control. Mr. Hahn blames himself for his wife and son's death. Mr. Hahn could of been someone great, but it was after the death of his wife and son that made him into the person of who he is today. Mr. Miyagi, on the other hand, he is comfortable on where he is in his life.Again, as the movie progresses, Mr. Hahn and Dre go to the Kung Fu studio to talk to the Kung Fu teacher. The Kung Fu teacher is not as over the top as John Crease from the original Karate Kid movie; John Crease was very over-the-top as the villain, and he was pretty memorable for that role. The Kung Fu teacher in the re-make is pretty menacing; basically, he wants to prove that his way of teaching Kung Fu is the superior way over Jackie Chan's way of teaching the martial art. It is there that the Kung Fu teacher tells Dre and Mr. Hahn that his students will not bother him until the tournament.Dre trains for the tournament with the help of Mr. Hahn. Instead of ""Wax on, wax off."" it's now ""Coat on, coat off"". Also, I like it when Mr. Hahn actually explains to Dre on why Dre keeps on taking his coat on and off; to teach Dre that Kung Fu lives in everything that they do, how they put the jacket on and off, and how they treat people. Mr. Miyagi, on the other hand, he doesn't explain on why he had Daniel paint his fence, paint his house, sand his deck, and clean and wax his cars; in my opinion, he made Daniel do this to show him discipline and to follow through with something. Again, that's my opinion. I also like when Dre and Mr. Hahn go to the place where Kung Fu originated; that was pretty awesome, and Mr. Hahn explaining to Dre the history of Kung Fu.Once the training is done, the tournament is on; Dre makes it to the finals with the main bully. The bully, under instruction from the Kung Fu master, break's Dre's leg. Mr. Hahn takes Dre to the back to fix what's going on with Dre. Mr. Hahn thinks that he is going to be in even more pain if he goes out there with his leg in the shape as is, but Dre wants to finish what he started. Dre does go back out, and win's the day. What's awesome is that, like the original, the students from the opposing team from the Kung Fu school actually bow to Mr. Hahn as the Kung Fu teacher looks in shock.All and all, I honestly think that this is a really good re-make. Will it overtake the original as being the most memorable? No, but The Karate Kid (2010) does have some really good moments, just like the original one does. The re-make does not have the over-the-top bad guys, but I honestly think it is a good re-make. Thank you for reading my review.

The story of the 1984 hit movie is predictable and Ralph Macchio and his karate fight scenes look disappointingly amateurish, but Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita, Oscar-nominated as a wise karate teacher, is fun throughout, and the master-pupil relation between Miyagi sensei and Macchio's young hero Daniel is convincing and touching.Now after three not-so-great sequels (including one starring then unknown Hilary Swank), a remake arrives with Jaden Smith as Dre Parker, a new kid in a Beijing school, and Jackie Chan as Mr. Han, a quiet maintenance man who teaches martial arts to the bullied boy. Probably the new ""Karate Kid"" movie should be called ""The Kung-fu Kid"" as karate is hardly mentioned in the film, but this is not really a big problem. Beautifully shot in China and professionally choreographed, the remade ""Karate Kid"" is overall enjoyable, but is deeply flawed and weak in many regards.Though the friendship between the two main characters Dre and Mr. Han is credible, and Jackie Chan's acting itself is very good, Chan's Mr. Han lacks a sense of humor that lends depth to the character of Miyagi. One subplot about Dre's love story, devoid of chemistry, only slows down the pace of the 140 minute film, which is too long by 40 minutes. Occasional attempt at humor are weak at best, but if you have seen any of director Harald Zwart's unimpressive works in the past (""Agent Cody Banks"" ""The Pink Panther 2""), you will not be surprised at that.The martial art tournament sequence is acceptable, though wires and stunts are obviously used. Jackie Chan also gives one amusing fight scene against the bullying boys, almost stealing the film from Jaden Smith.This is not a bad remake. Only that it needs a new title and a tighter story.",3,Not a Bad Remake,1282003200,"08 17, 2010",2010,1812,"['first', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'Apprentice', 'story', '1984', 'hit', 'movie', 'predictable', 'Ralph', 'Macchio', 'karate', 'fight', 'scenes', 'look', 'disappointingly', 'amateurish', 'Noriyuki', ""'Pat"", 'Morita', 'Oscar-nominated', 'wise', 'karate', 'teacher', 'fun', 'master-pupil', 'relation', 'Miyagi', 'sensei', 'Macchio', 'young', 'hero', 'Daniel', 'convincing', 'touching.Now', 'three', 'not-so-great', 'sequels', 'including', 'one', 'starring', 'then', 'unknown', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'remake', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'Dre', 'Parker', 'new', 'kid', 'Beijing', 'school', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Mr.', 'Han', 'quiet', 'maintenance', 'man', 'who', 'martial', 'arts', 'bullied', 'boy', 'Probably', 'new', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'called', 'Kung-fu', 'Kid', 'karate', 'hardly', 'mentioned', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'big', 'problem', 'Beautifully', 'shot', 'China', 'professionally', 'choreographed', 'remade', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'overall', 'enjoyable', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'weak', 'many', 'regards.Though', 'friendship', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Dre', 'Mr.', 'Han', 'credible', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'Chan', 'Mr.', 'Han', 'sense', 'humor', 'depth', 'character', 'Miyagi', 'One', 'subplot', 'Dre', 'love', 'story', 'devoid', 'chemistry', 'only', 'down', 'pace', '140', 'minute', 'film', 'too', 'long', '40', 'minutes', 'Occasional', 'attempt', 'humor', 'are', 'weak', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'director', 'Harald', 'Zwart', 'unimpressive', 'works', 'past', 'Agent', 'Cody', 'Banks', 'Pink', 'Panther', '2', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'that.The', 'martial', 'art', 'tournament', 'sequence', 'acceptable', 'wires', 'stunts', 'are', 'obviously', 'used', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'also', 'one', 'amusing', 'fight', 'scene', 'bullying', 'boys', 'almost', 'stealing', 'film', 'Jaden', 'Smith.This', 'not', 'bad', 'remake', 'Only', 'new', 'title', 'tighter', 'story']",N/A
1312198,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002ZG99CC,Turfseer,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0'The Karate Kid' is about a Kung Fu competition so why the misnomer? Apparently American producers reasoned that they could sell more tickets to the older crowd who enjoyed the 1984 production of the same name. This new 'Karate Kid' was a joint Chinese-American production and it was actually titled 'Kung Fu Dream' when released in China.The main conceit of the new version is similar to the old. A boy is mentored by an older man who is an expert in the martial arts, so that he can fend off a coterie of bullies. Here, Jaden Smith is 12 year old Dre, who's forced to leave his old neighborhood in Detroit after his mother is transferred to company headquarters in China.The best part of the film involves Jackie Chan as Mr. Han, a maintenance man in Dre's apartment complex, who teaches Dre that Kung Fu is more than just learning physical moves. Dre must first get over his arrogance, believing that he just about knows everything. Han focuses on Dre's bad habit of always leaving his jacket on the ground, so he has him continuously put the jacket on, throw it to the ground and then hang it up. Later, we learn that this tedious exercise is actually one of Han's techniques to sharpen Dre's coordination. Han also takes Dre up to the Wudang Mountains where a woman reflecting a cobra's movements and a drink from a magical well enhances Dre's appreciation of what Kung Fu is all about.Despite the presence of the earnest Mr. Han, this Karate Kid reboot still leaves a bad taste in one's mouth for a number of reasons. Firstly, there was no effort on the part of the film's scenarists to develop any of the antagonist's characters. The bullies who harass Dre along with the psychopathic Kung Fu master (who promulgates a 'no mercy' philosophy) have no idiosyncrasies to distinguish them from any other typical bad guy we've seen on the silver screen for ages.I also thought it was distasteful depicting pre-pubescent boys as being so violent. If the boys were older teenagers, then perhaps something more realistic could have been developed on the subject of gang psychology. But when we're talking about 12 year olds, I had a hard time believing that Chinese authorities would allow a school like that to operate. Especially after it becomes apparent during a major sanctioned tournament, that juveniles are using Kung Fu techniques to break their opponents' legs at the behest of a mentor who appears to enjoy encouraging criminal conduct.As for verisimilitude of the tournament itself, Dre was injured twice, in his match with two separate opponents. He was given two minutes to return to the ring, but it sure seemed as if Han needed more time than that to use his 'fire cupping' to heal Dre (it looked like the Dre's leg was seriously injured but he miraculously recovers). And with a second blow to the leg, it seems absurd that Dre would be able to continue--but of course, since he MUST win, he does!There's also sub-plot here involving some puppy love between Meiying, a talented violin student and Dre, who gets into trouble with the girl's parents when he encourages her to cut school. Dre has no idea that Meiying's audition has been moved up a day and still seems to be blamed for something he couldn't have known. He also claps after Meiying performs and appears to run afoul of the audition etiquette. Han helps him write a letter of apology and it's ultimately accepted by the girl's parents.It's hard to appreciate Jaden Smith's performance since his character is depicted as being so arrogant before he 'sees the light.' Why not tone down the narcissism a bit so that Dre is a tad bit more tolerable? Finally there is some redemption when Dre is able to dispense with all the self-centeredness and bond with Han, who reveals that he lost his wife and child in a car accident years before.The new Karate Kid holds one's interest despite the simplicity of its narrative. The comic book villains prevent the film from reaching a higher aesthetic level. I understand that there's a new Karate Kid in the offing with Chan and Smith ready to reprise their roles. It should be more interesting since Jaden Smith is no longer 12 years old and might bring something more to the part, given his now advanced age.",2,Chan shines as Kung Fu mentor but antagonists never rise above level of comic book villains,1404259200,"07 2, 2014",2014,4287,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Rating', '2.5', ""5.0'The"", 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'competition', 'so', 'why', 'misnomer', 'Apparently', 'American', 'producers', 'reasoned', 'could', 'sell', 'more', 'tickets', 'older', 'crowd', 'who', 'enjoyed', '1984', 'production', 'same', 'name', 'new', ""'Karate"", 'Kid', 'was', 'joint', 'Chinese-American', 'production', 'was', 'actually', 'titled', ""'Kung"", 'Fu', 'Dream', 'when', 'released', 'China.The', 'main', 'conceit', 'new', 'version', 'similar', 'old', 'boy', 'mentored', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'expert', 'martial', 'arts', 'so', 'can', 'fend', 'off', 'coterie', 'bullies', 'Here', 'Jaden', 'Smith', '12', 'year', 'old', 'Dre', 'who', 'forced', 'leave', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'Detroit', 'mother', 'transferred', 'company', 'headquarters', 'China.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Mr.', 'Han', 'maintenance', 'man', 'Dre', 'apartment', 'complex', 'who', 'Dre', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'more', 'just', 'learning', 'physical', 'moves', 'Dre', 'must', 'first', 'get', 'arrogance', 'believing', 'just', 'knows', 'everything', 'Han', 'Dre', 'bad', 'habit', 'always', 'leaving', 'jacket', 'ground', 'continuously', 'put', 'jacket', 'throw', 'ground', 'then', 'hang', 'up', 'Later', 'learn', 'tedious', 'exercise', 'actually', 'one', 'Han', 'techniques', 'sharpen', 'Dre', 'coordination', 'Han', 'also', 'Dre', 'up', 'Wudang', 'Mountains', 'where', 'woman', 'reflecting', 'cobra', 'movements', 'drink', 'magical', 'well', 'Dre', 'appreciation', 'what', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'about.Despite', 'presence', 'earnest', 'Mr.', 'Han', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'reboot', 'still', 'bad', 'taste', 'one', 'mouth', 'number', 'reasons', 'Firstly', 'was', 'effort', 'part', 'film', 'scenarists', 'develop', 'antagonist', 'characters', 'bullies', 'who', 'harass', 'Dre', 'psychopathic', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'master', 'who', ""'no"", 'mercy', 'philosophy', 'have', 'idiosyncrasies', 'distinguish', 'other', 'typical', 'bad', 'guy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'silver', 'screen', 'ages.I', 'also', 'thought', 'was', 'distasteful', 'depicting', 'pre-pubescent', 'boys', 'being', 'so', 'violent', 'boys', 'were', 'older', 'teenagers', 'then', 'perhaps', 'something', 'more', 'realistic', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'subject', 'gang', 'psychology', 'when', ""'re"", 'talking', '12', 'year', 'olds', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'Chinese', 'authorities', 'would', 'allow', 'school', 'operate', 'Especially', 'apparent', 'major', 'sanctioned', 'tournament', 'juveniles', 'are', 'using', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'techniques', 'break', 'opponents', 'legs', 'behest', 'mentor', 'who', 'enjoy', 'encouraging', 'criminal', 'conduct.As', 'verisimilitude', 'tournament', 'Dre', 'was', 'injured', 'twice', 'match', 'two', 'separate', 'opponents', 'was', 'given', 'two', 'minutes', 'return', 'ring', 'sure', 'seemed', 'Han', 'needed', 'more', 'time', 'use', ""'fire"", 'cupping', 'heal', 'Dre', 'looked', 'Dre', 'leg', 'was', 'seriously', 'injured', 'miraculously', 'recovers', 'second', 'blow', 'leg', 'absurd', 'Dre', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'continue', 'course', 'MUST', 'win', 'also', 'sub-plot', 'here', 'involving', 'puppy', 'love', 'Meiying', 'talented', 'violin', 'student', 'Dre', 'who', 'trouble', 'girl', 'parents', 'when', 'cut', 'school', 'Dre', 'idea', 'Meiying', 'audition', 'been', 'moved', 'up', 'day', 'still', 'be', 'blamed', 'something', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'known', 'also', 'claps', 'Meiying', 'performs', 'run', 'afoul', 'audition', 'etiquette', 'Han', 'write', 'letter', 'apology', 'ultimately', 'accepted', 'girl', 'parents.It', 'hard', 'appreciate', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'performance', 'character', 'depicted', 'being', 'so', 'arrogant', 'light', 'Why', 'not', 'tone', 'down', 'narcissism', 'bit', 'so', 'Dre', 'tad', 'bit', 'more', 'tolerable', 'Finally', 'redemption', 'when', 'Dre', 'able', 'dispense', 'self-centeredness', 'bond', 'Han', 'who', 'lost', 'wife', 'child', 'car', 'accident', 'years', 'before.The', 'new', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'one', 'interest', 'simplicity', 'narrative', 'comic', 'book', 'villains', 'prevent', 'film', 'reaching', 'higher', 'aesthetic', 'level', 'understand', 'new', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'offing', 'Chan', 'Smith', 'ready', 'reprise', 'roles', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'no', 'longer', '12', 'years', 'old', 'might', 'bring', 'something', 'more', 'part', 'given', 'now', 'advanced', 'age']",N/A

1312202,A2FWM7FQVAQ5V9,B002ZG99CC,Valley Val AZ,"[2, 7]","Here is a karate kid for the new generation. I worry about movie remakes, especially when the original has become iconic for so many people, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out how good this version is.The main character, Dre (Jaden Smith), gives new meaning to being the new kid in town. He and his mother (Taraji P. Henson) move from Detroit to  China for her job (I don't actually remember seeing what it is she does for a living, but... I guess that's not the point of the movie). Dre is a black, cornrow wearing American living in Beijing. He is not thrilled about being there but things look up when he spots the pretty Mei Ying (Wenwen Han).  Mei Ying's parents want her to focus on her musical talents and not on a boyfriend, but she and Dre develop a friendship and try to spend as much time together as possible.Their relationship draws unwanted attention from the school bully, Cheng (Zhenwei Wang). Cheng attends a kung fu school run by a master who tells the students, ""We do not stop when our enemy is down"" and Cheng takes that message to heart.  As is typical with most bullies, Cheng has a group of boys who follow him and they make it a point to torment Dre every chance they get.  Smith does a good job of showing the fear of trying to stay one step ahead of a bully, hiding around corners until Chang and his gang have passed. Finally, Dre can no longer outrun Cheng, and he wants to learn to fight back.Enter Mr. Han (Jackie Chan in all his choreographed amazingness), who takes Dre under his wing and shows him some moves. Han actually teaches Dre kung fu moves rather than karate, but you don't wanna go messin' with a name people already know.  Mr. Han uses some unconventional ways to train Dre, but not exactly the same methods as Morita used with Macchio in the original movie.  Although Chan does not have much dialogue, he is great at playing the mentor and at showing the anguish of past events. It was interesting seeing him play a more serious role.  Mr. Han is the teacher, but in many ways, he needs Dre as much as Dre needs him.The movie has plenty of laughs delivered by both Smith and Chan.  Also, even though I knew, in general, what was going to happen, I still found myself whipping away a few tears (typically for uplifting moments, though).  As a nice bonus, there are some great scenes showing the beauty of China including Dragon Well, the Great Wall, and the Forbidden City (which doesn't appear to be so forbidden anymore).Smith's character is 12, but he looks about 10 because of his diminutive size.  It is disturbing seeing Dre getting beat down, particularly during one brutal scene at the beginning. However, your older kids can definitely watch this movie because the lessons they'll learn about discipline and respect and facing their fears more than make up for any violence they'll see.  The movie is called ""The Karate Kid,"" so expect some violence.Like the original, I found this to be an enjoyable, uplifting film. I recommend this movie and I actually give it 3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars, but since that rating is not available, I'm rounding to a 4.Oh, and watch out for Jaden Smith. I had intended to not compare him to his father, Will; however, there were so many times in the movie where I saw some of Will's swagger in Jaden, down to similar facial expressions and comic timing.

For instance one reviewer was upset because it's called the Karate Kid, but there's no Karate (in the formal sense) in the movie.  This film is not trying to be any more authentic than the first film was.  It strikes a nice balance between following the original storyline and adding enough new material to be interesting.  There are a couple of scenes that pay homage to the original movie.  I won't describe them (no spoilers!) but if you saw the first movie you will notice and get a few chuckles.  There's a lot to like, including Jackie Chan in the mentor role and a few scenes of real martial artists displaying their highly developed skills.The only criticism I have is the tournament fight scenes feel quite a bit more violent than in the first movie.  It's hard to believe that young teenagers would be allowed to fight using martial arts without any protection and a clear sense of limits.  The fights are exciting in part because they convey great danger, but parents may want to remind their young martial artist children not to take such risks in the real world.In a nutshell if you liked the first movie then I believe you will enjoy this reprise.",3,Breakout the popcorn and enjoy the film!,1288742400,"11 3, 2010",2010,1259,"['call', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'way', 'saying', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously', 'instance', 'one', 'reviewer', 'was', 'upset', 'called', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Karate', 'formal', 'sense', 'movie', 'film', 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'more', 'authentic', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'nice', 'balance', 'following', 'original', 'storyline', 'adding', 'enough', 'new', 'material', 'be', 'interesting', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'pay', 'homage', 'original', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'describe', 'spoilers', 'saw', 'first', 'movie', 'will', 'notice', 'get', 'few', 'chuckles', 'lot', 'like', 'including', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'mentor', 'role', 'few', 'scenes', 'real', 'martial', 'artists', 'displaying', 'highly', 'developed', 'skills.The', 'only', 'criticism', 'have', 'tournament', 'fight', 'scenes', 'feel', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'violent', 'first', 'movie', 'hard', 'believe', 'young', 'teenagers', 'would', 'be', 'allowed', 'fight', 'using', 'martial', 'arts', 'protection', 'clear', 'sense', 'limits', 'fights', 'are', 'exciting', 'part', 'convey', 'great', 'danger', 'parents', 'may', 'want', 'remind', 'young', 'martial', 'artist', 'children', 'not', 'take', 'such', 'risks', 'real', 'world.In', 'nutshell', 'liked', 'first', 'movie', 'then', 'believe', 'will', 'enjoy', 'reprise']",N/A

That said, this stays reasonably true to its origin (as I recall it), but still offers enough newness to make remaking worthwhile.Jaden Smith makes an exceptionally handsome young lead. Jackie Chan takes the role of Mr. Miyagi (sorry - Mr. Han) in a more serious manner than his past films might lead you to believe, and does a more than fair job of it. (He does get one lovely bit of comedic choreography, though.) Jaden's girlfriends is, of course, tweenage cuteness incarnate. China is China - majestic at times, crowded, isolated, commercial, spiritual, and all its other selves, a highly adaptable backdrop to any mood the movie might need. It's no spoiler to say that the bullied new kid wins out gloriously in the end.My one complaint is the way he wins out. Where the heck did that move come from? No matter, it was a good one. A complaint that I expect to hear but don't share is, why was his mother just sitting there while her son was getting  whomped into floorboards? If you have to ask, you probably won't understand the answer. Mothers of sons know that their sons are going to do things that get them hurt - better they get hurt under adult supervision, with a medic close at hand. And, since he's going to do wild and life-threatening things anyway, a mentor you more-or-less approve of lets you keep an eye on the craziness. In the alternative, he does crazy stuff anyway but does it with worse people and hides it from you. I don't call that bad mothering - quite the opposite. It's hard to keep rapport with tween- and teen-aged kids; you take what rapport there is where you find it.A bit more brutal than the original, it's a product of a different decade.

1312208,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B002ZG99CC,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[2, 5]","2010's remake of 1984's ""Karate Kid"" has been titled different in different countries. Director Harald Zwart's film was called `The Kung Fu Kid"" in China, ""The Best Kid"" in Japan and South Korea while U.S. audiences are stuck to the original film's title ""The Karate Kid"". My first complaint with the film's title is that why call a film ""Karate Kid"" when it is clearly about a teen who learns Kung Fu and yet it is called ""Karate Kid""; I thought this was the usual Hollywood garbage and it would be a slap in the face of the Chinese martial arts since the title is so misleading. Chinese Kung Fu is filled with circular movements that are derived from the movements of animals. Japan's Karate is a more linear art that is meant to finish an opponent with one blow, and to fight numerous opponents. Yet, with Jackie Chan in a the role of Pat Morita, I had hope that the film would give respect to the Chinese martial art and I was not disappointed.This film is not related to the DC comics character with the same name. The film's association with 1984's original ""Karate Kid"" is the mere fact that it captures the same premise, same key plot sequences but it has different characters and a different backdrop (this time the film takes place in China). I would say that it is not a remake but more of a re-issue; and thanks to Jackie Chan, he makes the film very credible in a dramatic role. (Yes, in Asia, Chan isn't just known for his action-comedies, he is a well-respected singer and dramatic actor)11-year old Dre (Jaden Smith) and his mom (Taraji Parker) locates to China because of the demands of her job. A stranger in a foreign land, and without friends, Dre becomes fond of a sweet Chinese girl named Mei Ying (Wen Wen Han) but this infatuation leads to him being bullied by a young practitioner of Kung Fu named Cheng (Zhenwei Wang). The situation escalates and Dre ends up being defended by Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), the maintenance man in their place of dwelling who is also a kung fu master. Han advises that Dre needs to settle things with Cheng through his sensei, Master Li (Rongguang Yu) but the two soon discovers that he is every bit as hard headed and arrogant as Cheng. Forced to barter to be allowed to leave without incident, Han agrees to the stipulation that Dre will fight Cheng and his whole gang one-on-one in a Kung Fu tournament. Dre only has little over a month to train under Mr. Han; student must learn from the teacher as the teacher also becomes the student. The two begin to form a strange bond as they meet their antagonists head on to defend their honor...The charm of the original was the fact that Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) was just so charismatic as the Karate master. Chan matches Morita's charm in every way possible and proves to be quite convincing as the aging Kung Fu master. Instead of the wax on, wax off, paint the fence and sand the floor type of thing, Mr. Han opts to have Dre train by taking off his jacket, hanging it, putting it on, dropping it, and then hanging it again. It does make a good transition in the script seeing as Dre is a slob and is always leaving his jacket on the floor. Martial arts is a way of life after all, and a practitioner of the art embraces its philosophy as well as its movements; it becomes a way of life. The film does manage to establish a credible relationship between the two and Mr. Han as with Mr. Miyagi in the original also had his demons to face.I guess what the original had that this remake didn't was the fact that it was realistic. Daniel (the original character) was a weakling and didn't have the savvy to become a very capable fighter in month. Miyagi gave him the tools he needed to face his tormentors; Daniel could never become a warrior, but he had the quality moves and heart to win over his opponents. This time around, this remake takes a little cartoonish route, as Dre becomes a capable fighter in a month; displaying the skills and movements that equal his opponents who had been practicing the art for a lot longer time; Dre didn't feel like an underdog but rather a competitor with equal skill--in a month.  I had a hard time buying into this, I cannot believe that a student who had no exposure to Kung Fu can pull off a final move that he observed but never really taught. Daniel was a better character than Dre. The supporting characters are also a little cartoonish. Dre's mother does have more screen time and develops a relationship with Han which was good. I also liked the fact that the script settles for a theme of friendship between Dre and Mei, rather than the teen love between Daniel and Ali. This was a good change, as the film also pays respect to Chinese culture. The relationship between Han and Dre was developed well, but then, with Jackie Chan, it is easy to have an attachment to his character. However, Smith wasn't totally convincing and he felt a little too whiny; I can forgive this since he is only 11 years old in the film.The fights were nicely executed and I was impressed with the quality of the choreography. Cheng and the other young Chinese fighters were real convincing in pulling off those complex moves. The hits looked like they were actually making contact and the camera work was kept tight with some flashy use of slow motion and clever editing. There were some wire fu included in the fights, but they weren't that obvious; Chan and company did their work well. Oh, as with the Daniel's Crane Kick, Dre develops his own signature move; and it was very cool. The cinematography was stellar as the viewer becomes privy to the slums of the country as well as its beauty. The scene when Han and Dre traveled to the temple atop the mountaintop was breathtaking, and there is a very cool scene with a mysterious woman (a Michelle Yeoh look-alike) who entrances a cobra.So the question remains: Is this film a worthy remake? Well, it is, as it does pay homage to the original and a lot of the key scenes was more or less a tribute. This does render the film a little too predictable so those who loved the original will find this remake very unnecessary. I am one of those people, but despite its flaws, I have to admit the film was very entertaining that it did establish the differences between the Chinese art to the Japanese art, as well as paying reverence to both martial arts systems. The film does make it clear: ""It's not karate"". It does have a lesson to share, while it is not as memorable as the original; it was still quite germane in today's times.Recommended Timidly.

Pat Morita gave great charisma to his character. Every scene with Morita was memorable.Jaden would not be in this dreck of a movie if his parents weren't bankrolling him. He is unlikable and his character is a punk.The original character was a decent kid who was placed in a challenging situation.The friendship theme seemed so pale in comparison to the originalEvery thing seemed so scripted and just simply a carbon copy of the original.The love interest scene was weak because the characters were too young. It would have worked a little better if the actors were older.The bad guy instructor should have spoken some english. He also had no presence either.The final winning point scene was much better in the original. The famous crane kick.This version had some video game style kick that looked too flashy.Again, the choreography was decent for the most part. It was the scripted acting and ripped lines that made this movie a blah fest.Again hollywoood takes classic movies and remakes them into crap.Another movie to add the the long list of bad remakes.Next time, save us the money and simply re release the original into theaters.",2,The Unnecessary Remake Kid,1299024000,"03 2, 2011",2011,1749,"['unnecessary', 'remake', 'starring', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'first', 'was', 'Day', 'Earth', 'Stood', 'Still', 'choreography', 'was', 'decent', 'viewer', 'got', 'see', 'decent', 'Kung', 'Fu.', 'had', 'many', 'problems', 'title', 'KARATE', 'KID', 'had', 'karate', 'More', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'kid.Why', 'set', 'China', 'came', 'big', 'ad', 'tourism', 'China.This', 'movie', 'was', 'basically', 'pale', 'immitation', 'original', 'movie', 'original', 'lines', 'forced', 'different', 'scenes', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'capture', 'magic', 'drama', 'original.Jackie', 'Chan', 'was', 'not', 'charming', 'was', 'simply', 'bland', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'gave', 'great', 'charisma', 'character', 'scene', 'Morita', 'was', 'memorable.Jaden', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'dreck', 'movie', 'parents', 'were', ""n't"", 'bankrolling', 'unlikable', 'character', 'punk.The', 'original', 'character', 'was', 'decent', 'kid', 'who', 'was', 'placed', 'challenging', 'situation.The', 'friendship', 'theme', 'seemed', 'so', 'pale', 'comparison', 'originalEvery', 'thing', 'seemed', 'so', 'scripted', 'just', 'simply', 'carbon', 'copy', 'original.The', 'love', 'interest', 'scene', 'was', 'weak', 'characters', 'were', 'too', 'young', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'little', 'better', 'actors', 'were', 'older.The', 'bad', 'guy', 'instructor', 'should', 'have', 'spoken', 'english', 'also', 'had', 'presence', 'either.The', 'final', 'winning', 'point', 'scene', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'original', 'famous', 'crane', 'kick.This', 'version', 'had', 'video', 'game', 'style', 'kick', 'looked', 'too', 'flashy.Again', 'choreography', 'was', 'decent', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'scripted', 'acting', 'ripped', 'lines', 'made', 'movie', 'blah', 'fest.Again', 'hollywoood', 'classic', 'movies', 'remakes', 'crap.Another', 'movie', 'add', 'long', 'list', 'bad', 'remakes.Next', 'time', 'save', 'money', 'simply', 're', 'release', 'original', 'theaters']",N/A
