Between the computer and the TV our poor backs are getting stiff and weak, a sitting duck for injury, sitting (or shlumping!) being the operative word. ""Save Your Lower Back"" with Annette Fletcher is a wonderful antidote, and your whole body will thank you, as it stretches and strengthens not just the back but the muscles around the back, and it just makes you feel wonderful all over.This DVD is made for ordinary people. No matter what kind of shape you're in, you'll get the most out of it. And at 45 minutes (this includes a tutorial of your muscles, as well as an excellent teaching segment on posture) it isn't overwhelming. As a senior, I can vouch for it being perfect for keeping flexibility in a body that if left alone quickly gets creaky and stiff. Along with going to the gym, I'm going to use this DVD regularly, because it really makes me feel fabulous, and you can feel fabulous at any age!Favorite moves include the breaststroke, and the final heavenly hip stretch. If like me, you find sitting cross-legged hard on your knees, the one exercise that has this position I did with my legs straight out, about a foot apart, and got a lot out of the stretch. Always modify according to what your body can do.Annette is an expert teacher and knows how to explain each move perfectly. The exercises don't take much room (as much as arms width and full length with your arms stretched overhead) and you'll need a towel or mat for the floor and a towel folded for your head. Quick, simple and effective, this DVD is great!",5,"Quick, Simple, Effective.",1300579200,"03 20, 2011",2011,1567,"['Modern', 'life', 'hell', 'backs', 'computer', 'TV', 'poor', 'backs', 'are', 'getting', 'stiff', 'weak', 'sitting', 'duck', 'injury', 'sitting', 'shlumping', 'being', 'operative', 'word', 'Save', 'Your', 'Lower', 'Back', 'Annette', 'Fletcher', 'wonderful', 'antidote', 'whole', 'body', 'will', 'thank', 'not', 'just', 'back', 'muscles', 'back', 'just', 'feel', 'wonderful', 'over.This', 'DVD', 'made', 'ordinary', 'people', 'matter', 'what', 'kind', 'shape', ""'re"", ""'ll"", 'get', 'most', '45', 'minutes', 'tutorial', 'muscles', 'as', 'well', 'excellent', 'teaching', 'segment', 'posture', ""n't"", 'overwhelming', 'senior', 'can', 'vouch', 'being', 'perfect', 'keeping', 'flexibility', 'body', 'left', 'alone', 'quickly', 'creaky', 'stiff', 'going', 'gym', ""'m"", 'going', 'use', 'DVD', 'regularly', 'really', 'feel', 'fabulous', 'can', 'feel', 'fabulous', 'age', 'Favorite', 'include', 'breaststroke', 'final', 'heavenly', 'hip', 'stretch', 'find', 'sitting', 'cross-legged', 'hard', 'knees', 'one', 'exercise', 'position', 'did', 'legs', 'straight', 'out', 'foot', 'apart', 'got', 'lot', 'stretch', 'Always', 'modify', 'according', 'what', 'body', 'can', 'do.Annette', 'expert', 'teacher', 'how', 'explain', 'move', 'perfectly', 'exercises', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'room', 'as', 'much', 'arms', 'width', 'full', 'length', 'arms', 'stretched', 'overhead', ""'ll"", 'need', 'towel', 'mat', 'floor', 'towel', 'folded', 'head', 'Quick', 'simple', 'effective', 'DVD', 'great']","Save Your Lower Back!

902448,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00097C4B2,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[32, 33]","I am in my mid-40s, and over the past few years, I have had several episodes of lower back pain.  Given this, I thought this DVD would be helpful to add to my collection.  Instructor Annette Fletcher is a certified Pilates instructor, certified personal trainer, and modern dancer.  She incorporates some elements of both Pilates and yoga into this stretch workout, but she moves at a very slow, measured pace.  Fletcher is featured working out alone and providing live instruction.The Main Menu offers options for Welcome, Muscles of the Lower Back & Hips, Release, Strengthen, Stretch, Posture; there is also additional information on Fletcher and her DVDs plus credits and disclaimer.  The Welcome and Muscles are each brief overview segments provided by Fletcher.  I have given descriptions of the remaining segments below:RELEASE (5.5 minutes)Fletcher begins lying in constructive rest, simply allowing gravity to release the psoas muscles.  Next comes knee in, other leg moving out extensions.  This is followed by stretching the arms overhead while keeping the pelvic area stable.STRENGTHEN (18 minutes)Lying on the back, Fletcher starts this segment with a pelvic tilt, moving into several different bridge variations.  Coming into seated, she performs a half roll back to release the spine.  Next, she moves to the hands and knees for scapular isolations.  Remaining in this position, she performs leg lifts, then moves into alternating arms and legs.  Coming down onto her side, Fletcher performs side leg raises, circles, and small kicks.  To finish, she comes onto her stomach for leg lifts, breast stroke, and elbow plank.STRETCH (11 minutes)Fletcher starts this segment on hands and knees for cat/cow stretches, adding a knee in and up.  This is followed by a seated cross-legged forward bend.  Coming to a lying position, Fletcher performs a cross leg stretch and a lying twist.  She concludes with pigeon pose to stretch the hips.POSTURE (3.5)From a standing position, Fletcher reviews important components of proper posture, such as distributing the weight evenly on the feet and keeping the thighs back.Overall, I found this DVD to be very well done.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the Strengthen portion was not too easy, as many of the therapeutic workouts that I have tried wind up being too gentle for me given that I am an experienced exerciser.  I do wish that Fletcher had given some guidance on how the workout segments could be used separately:  she states only that you need to release before you can strengthen and stretch.  Done in its entirety, however, the entire practice is about 35 minutes long--quite a bit of time to devote to a therapeutic practice.Still, I have done this entire practice several times in the last week.  Unfortunately, I have not yet experienced any pain relief.  This may be because my current areas of discomfort are more in my hip/side waist, but I had still been hopefully that this DVD might help.  I will continue to use it, and as I do think it would be likely to help most with back pain, I would recommend it.",4,Well-done DVD to target core and back muscles,1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,3088,"['am', 'mid-40s', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'had', 'several', 'episodes', 'lower', 'back', 'pain', 'Given', 'thought', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'helpful', 'add', 'collection', 'Instructor', 'Annette', 'Fletcher', 'certified', 'Pilates', 'instructor', 'certified', 'personal', 'trainer', 'modern', 'dancer', 'elements', 'Pilates', 'yoga', 'stretch', 'workout', 'very', 'slow', 'measured', 'pace', 'Fletcher', 'featured', 'working', 'alone', 'providing', 'live', 'instruction.The', 'Main', 'Menu', 'options', 'Welcome', 'Muscles', 'Lower', 'Back', 'Hips', 'Release', 'Strengthen', 'Stretch', 'Posture', 'also', 'additional', 'information', 'Fletcher', 'DVDs', 'credits', 'disclaimer', 'Welcome', 'Muscles', 'are', 'brief', 'overview', 'segments', 'provided', 'Fletcher', 'have', 'given', 'descriptions', 'remaining', 'segments', 'RELEASE', '5.5', 'minutes', 'Fletcher', 'lying', 'constructive', 'rest', 'simply', 'allowing', 'gravity', 'release', 'psoas', 'muscles', 'Next', 'knee', 'other', 'leg', 'moving', 'out', 'extensions', 'followed', 'stretching', 'arms', 'overhead', 'keeping', 'pelvic', 'area', 'stable.STRENGTHEN', '18', 'minutes', 'Lying', 'back', 'Fletcher', 'segment', 'pelvic', 'tilt', 'moving', 'several', 'different', 'bridge', 'variations', 'Coming', 'seated', 'half', 'roll', 'back', 'release', 'spine', 'Next', 'hands', 'knees', 'scapular', 'isolations', 'Remaining', 'position', 'leg', 'lifts', 'then', 'alternating', 'arms', 'legs', 'Coming', 'down', 'side', 'Fletcher', 'side', 'leg', 'circles', 'small', 'kicks', 'finish', 'stomach', 'leg', 'lifts', 'breast', 'stroke', 'elbow', 'plank.STRETCH', '11', 'minutes', 'Fletcher', 'segment', 'hands', 'knees', 'cat/cow', 'stretches', 'adding', 'knee', 'up', 'followed', 'seated', 'cross-legged', 'forward', 'bend', 'Coming', 'lying', 'position', 'Fletcher', 'cross', 'leg', 'stretch', 'lying', 'twist', 'pigeon', 'pose', 'stretch', 'hips.POSTURE', '3.5', 'standing', 'position', 'Fletcher', 'important', 'components', 'proper', 'posture', 'such', 'distributing', 'weight', 'evenly', 'feet', 'keeping', 'thighs', 'back.Overall', 'found', 'DVD', 'be', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'discover', 'Strengthen', 'portion', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'easy', 'many', 'therapeutic', 'workouts', 'have', 'tried', 'wind', 'up', 'being', 'too', 'gentle', 'given', 'am', 'experienced', 'exerciser', 'do', 'wish', 'Fletcher', 'had', 'given', 'guidance', 'how', 'workout', 'segments', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'separately', 'only', 'need', 'release', 'can', 'strengthen', 'stretch', 'Done', 'entirety', 'however', 'entire', 'practice', '35', 'minutes', 'long', 'quite', 'bit', 'time', 'devote', 'therapeutic', 'practice.Still', 'have', 'done', 'entire', 'practice', 'several', 'times', 'last', 'week', 'Unfortunately', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'experienced', 'pain', 'relief', 'may', 'be', 'current', 'areas', 'discomfort', 'are', 'more', 'hip/side', 'waist', 'had', 'still', 'been', 'hopefully', 'DVD', 'might', 'help', 'will', 'continue', 'use', 'do', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'likely', 'help', 'most', 'back', 'pain', 'would', 'recommend']","Save Your Lower Back!

Best yet, it is gentle enough for anyone who can sit on the floor and use gentle stretching. I find myself using this program several times a week and I wish to recommend it to anyone who leads a sedentary lifestyle which can shorten important muscles groups. In turn, it appears I found relief for my sciatica issues.This program brings awareness to stabilizing the psoas muscle and those surrounding.  Strengthening the core means a strong healthy back and strong thighs. The program begins with relaxation of the muscles of the lower back allowing them to relax so that strengthening exercises can become effective. The concept here is, ""how can you strengthen tight muscles?"" These exercises allow chiropractic adjustments and massages to become more effective, of which I am a huge fan.The 45 minute program includes these sections: Annette's welcome, an illustrated explanation of the location and function of the muscles of the lower back and hips; floor stretches which focus on releasing, strengthening, and stretching the hips, shoulders, lumbar area and lower back.I have used all of Annette Fletchers previous programs with positive results, and this now is my favorite.",5,Effective self-help for the lower back and hips,1303257600,"04 20, 2011",2011,1328,"['found', 'Save', 'Your', 'Lower', 'Back', 'totally', 'effective', 'user', 'friendly', 'program', 'common', 'issues', 'lower', 'back', 'hips', 'thighs', 'Best', 'yet', 'gentle', 'enough', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'sit', 'floor', 'use', 'gentle', 'stretching', 'find', 'using', 'program', 'several', 'times', 'week', 'wish', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'sedentary', 'lifestyle', 'can', 'shorten', 'important', 'muscles', 'groups', 'turn', 'found', 'relief', 'sciatica', 'issues.This', 'program', 'awareness', 'stabilizing', 'psoas', 'muscle', 'surrounding', 'Strengthening', 'core', 'strong', 'healthy', 'back', 'strong', 'thighs', 'program', 'relaxation', 'muscles', 'lower', 'back', 'allowing', 'relax', 'so', 'strengthening', 'exercises', 'can', 'become', 'effective', 'concept', 'here', 'how', 'can', 'strengthen', 'tight', 'muscles', 'exercises', 'allow', 'chiropractic', 'adjustments', 'massages', 'become', 'more', 'effective', 'am', 'huge', 'fan.The', '45', 'minute', 'program', 'sections', 'Annette', 'welcome', 'illustrated', 'explanation', 'location', 'function', 'muscles', 'lower', 'back', 'hips', 'floor', 'stretches', 'focus', 'releasing', 'strengthening', 'stretching', 'hips', 'shoulders', 'lumbar', 'area', 'lower', 'back.I', 'have', 'used', 'Annette', 'Fletchers', 'previous', 'programs', 'positive', 'results', 'now', 'favorite']","Save Your Lower Back!

I went to the doctor yesterday because I have been having pain, stiffness and numbness in my lower back and my left leg.  I have recently starting running and I was very upset because this has prevented me from running.  I am trying to lose weight and I thought that I was not going to be able to do anything active again.  The MD told me that she thinks it is sciatica or a herniated disc.  I have not had my MRI yet so we don't know for sure.I purchased this DVD about a month ago and had not used it yet.  I bought it because I know that I need to incorporate stretching into my routine.  So today I decided to do it in the hopes that I could ease some of the pain and stiffness in my back and leg.OH MY GOD!! When I started the video, I was stiff, in some pain and could barely get down on the floor. But, as I did the exercises I could feel my muscles releasing and the stiffness and pain subsided.  When I was done I felt like I had just come from the chiropractor!  I feel amazing!! I can stand up straight and I can walk around my house with a lot less pain and stiffness.  There is still a little there but nothing compared to how I had been feeling for the past 4 days.  I am so impressed by this DVD and this is only after doing it ONE TIME!!
