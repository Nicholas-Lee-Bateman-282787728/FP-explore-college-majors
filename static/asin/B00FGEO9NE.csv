Carrie is the main character, but she is such a mess, how could she possibly stay in the CIA. She hardly ever follows orders, but somehow everything always works out in her favor. They make her to be a pathetic, love sick character, which really kills the show for me. No matter what Brody does, she's still on his side. I just don't like the decline of her character. She started out strong, but winds up pathetic. Basically, I've grown to not like her character at all. Other than her character, the show is good.",2,"If this is how the CIA works, we are doomed",1399248000,"05 5, 2014",2014,634,"['more', 'watch', 'series', 'worse', 'Season', 'one', 'was', 'great', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'good', 'season', 'three', 'mess', 'Carrie', 'main', 'character', 'such', 'mess', 'how', 'could', 'possibly', 'stay', 'CIA', 'hardly', 'ever', 'orders', 'somehow', 'everything', 'always', 'out', 'favor', 'make', 'be', 'pathetic', 'love', 'sick', 'character', 'really', 'show', 'matter', 'what', 'Brody', 'still', 'side', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'decline', 'character', 'started', 'out', 'strong', 'up', 'pathetic', 'Basically', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'not', 'character', 'Other', 'character', 'show', 'good']",Homeland: Season 3

It went over two seasons and showed in detail the incredible after effects of the captivity experience upon the families back home.  that is what made it special.  not the tortures, not the shoot em up, bang, bang, scenes.i am sure we are about to get Brody back any minute now and my guess is that the cost to his daughter is going to be his ultimate achilles heel for the wrongs he has done.",5,"been there so yes, they've got it right",1381363200,"10 10, 2013",2013,2122,"['write', 'off', 'idiot', 'let', 'tell', 'husband', 'i', 'are', 'lawyers', 'also', 'skilled', 'musician', 'i', 'am', 'well', 'shown', 'artist', 'museum', 'other', 'shows', 'i', 'am', 'not', 'bragging', 'i', 'am', 'telling', 'also', 'have', 'mental', 'illnesses', 'i', 'have', 'had', 'unipolar', 'depression', 'being', 'late', 'teenager', 'bipolar', 'mother', 'who', 'now', '90', 'constant', 'psychiatric', 'treatment', 'facility', 'ignoring', 'FOUR', 'serious', 'psychiatric', 'conditions', 'entire', 'life', 'all', 'preamble', 'saying', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'doing', 'magnificent', 'job', 'playing', 'high', 'ability', 'professional', 'who', 'plunged', 'abyss', 'gone', 'off', 'meds', 'bipolar', 'disorder', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'real', 'i', 'could', 'spend', 'rest', 'day', 'listing', 'other', 'professionals', 'i', 'know', 'who', 'went', 'similar', 'plummets', 'never', 'recovered', 'danes', 'justly', 'Emmy', 'role', 'i', 'applaud', 'bringing', 'multi', 'dimensional', 'character', 'small', 'screen.next', 'apparently', 'viewers', 'are', 'having', 'problems', 'Brody', 'daughter', 'again', 'time', 'i', 'first', 'contracted', 'unipolar', 'depression', 'teen', 'i', 'had', 'friend', 'who', 'descended', 'schizophrenia', 'lived', 'washington', 'd.c.', 'where', 'parents', 'belonged', 'same', 'clubs', 'knew', 'same', 'types', 'people', 'girl', 'anything', 'teen', 'life', 'less', 'harrowing', 'someone', 'actually', 'going', 'experience', 'viewers', 'are', 'actually', 'writing', 'online', 'want', 'character', 'die', 'shows', 'too', 'many', 'years', 'following', 'action', 'adventure', 'entertainment', 'serious', 'underpinning.i', 'am', 'actually', 'enjoying', 'HOMELAND', 'more', 'other', 'layers', 'being', 'explored', 'show', 'show', 'was', 'based', 'was', 'Israel', 'went', 'two', 'seasons', 'showed', 'detail', 'incredible', 'effects', 'captivity', 'experience', 'families', 'back', 'home', 'what', 'made', 'special', 'not', 'tortures', 'not', 'shoot', 'up', 'bang', 'bang', 'scenes.i', 'am', 'sure', 'are', 'get', 'Brody', 'back', 'minute', 'now', 'guess', 'cost', 'daughter', 'going', 'be', 'ultimate', 'achilles', 'heel', 'wrongs', 'done']",Homeland: Season 3

I love serialized television but the only problem is if you watch something out of order it spoils a lot of the episodes that preceded it. So be sure to start with season one you will not regret it.Before I talk about season three I want to say if you have a chance to watch this in high definition on Blu-ray I highly recommend it. Nowadays things are shot in high definition and they look so much better and Homeland is a sterling example of that.Homeland is one of the shows that gets put under the microscope people complain about continuity and story or the science behind what the CIA can or cannot do. And I'll admit I sometimes stop at the implausibility of what I see in the show. The sad thing is that sometimes people I over analyze it to where the show just falls apart. I mean yes to me some of the things that they portray as happening or people doing are ridiculous but it's just a TV show. at least those kind of moments offer a time for you to yell your television and question how much of a brain certain characters have. With that said I think season three has been a good ride I think a few of the episodes in the middle that deal with Dana, were a little drawn out but Danan is a big reason Brody does what he does.But I'm somebody who loved season one so much that I think it may be my favorite 12 episodes of television ever. And season 2 was another good transition for the show and I liked it, but not as much of season one. And season three somewhere falls in line after that I'm a fan of the show I like it.PS it's kind of sad that Chris the son gets so marginalized he might just be a glorified extra now.",4,I'm satisfied with season three while not as good as one or two still decent.,1386806400,"12 12, 2013",2013,1734,"['Warning', ""'re"", 'new', 'Homeland', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'episode', 'order', 'starting', 'season', 'one', 'love', 'serialized', 'television', 'only', 'problem', 'watch', 'something', 'order', 'lot', 'episodes', 'preceded', 'So', 'be', 'sure', 'start', 'season', 'one', 'will', 'not', 'regret', 'it.Before', 'talk', 'season', 'three', 'want', 'say', 'have', 'chance', 'watch', 'high', 'definition', 'Blu-ray', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Nowadays', 'things', 'are', 'shot', 'high', 'definition', 'look', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Homeland', 'sterling', 'example', 'that.Homeland', 'one', 'shows', 'put', 'microscope', 'people', 'complain', 'continuity', 'story', 'science', 'what', 'CIA', 'can', 'can', 'not', 'do', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'sometimes', 'stop', 'implausibility', 'what', 'see', 'show', 'sad', 'thing', 'sometimes', 'people', 'analyze', 'where', 'show', 'just', 'apart', 'mean', 'yes', 'things', 'portray', 'happening', 'people', 'doing', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'just', 'TV', 'show', 'least', 'kind', 'moments', 'offer', 'time', 'yell', 'television', 'question', 'how', 'much', 'brain', 'certain', 'characters', 'have', 'said', 'think', 'season', 'three', 'been', 'good', 'ride', 'think', 'few', 'episodes', 'middle', 'deal', 'Dana', 'were', 'little', 'drawn', 'Danan', 'big', 'reason', 'Brody', 'what', 'does.But', ""'m"", 'somebody', 'who', 'loved', 'season', 'one', 'so', 'much', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'favorite', '12', 'episodes', 'television', 'ever', 'season', '2', 'was', 'good', 'transition', 'show', 'liked', 'not', 'much', 'season', 'one', 'season', 'three', 'somewhere', 'line', ""'m"", 'fan', 'show', 'like', 'it.PS', 'kind', 'sad', 'Chris', 'son', 'so', 'marginalized', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'glorified', 'extra', 'now']",Homeland: Season 3

Homeland is not a show I usually recommend to friends first as there are too many other better shows, and yet to be fair it's been a fairly entertaining watch as were previous seasons, and enjoyable for what it is.

Therefore let's just lazily repeat what we've already done - Carrie back in the nuthouse with her mental health problems (or is she ?), Brody locked away from the world all over again !Let's also waste endless screentime on Homeland's equivalent of 24's Kim Bauer, ie. the idiotic daughter that has nothing whatsoever to do with the main storyline, so let's keep coming up with absurd plots in order to keep her involved in the action - instead of just dumping the irritating brat and leaving her behind as the writer's eventually ended up doing with the rest of the Brody family.There was talk of killing the Brody character off at the end of season 2. One gets the feeling the writer's regretted not making that decision, because the character now has no storyline left ! This explains why the 2nd lead of the show is absent for half the season.  So what are we left with instead ?  Endless boring scenes of Mandy Patinkin and the guy from Amadeus in rooms talking plot and very little else !The final insult is trying to trick the viewer into believing that Brody is actually dead - when he so obviously isn't !If Brody is really dead why don't we see him actually expire ?  Why don't we see his body afterwards like we did with Abu Nasir ?Everyone knows that with that style of hanging a person can be hanging like that for ages without actually dying - how convenient plotwise all of this is ! A death that takes ages to happen, a death that happens off screen and no body to be shown when it does supposedly happen - I'm not buying any of it !If Brody really thought he was going to die why doesn't he put any of his affairs in order beforehand ? As a Muslim, why don't we see him making his peace with God - even Sadam Hussein did that at the end !  In his so-called final conversation with Carrie, why doesn't he simply tell her he loves her and to take care of their baby ? At no point does Brody ever behave like a man who's facing death - so it's either lousy writing letting those scenes down or for some reason that won't be revealed to us until season 4, Brody knows he isn't actually going to die. The writer's have tricked us before by making us think that Carrie has had another breakdown when it's all really Saul's masterplan to get her recruited by the enemy instead - fool me once shame on you, fool me twice...All in all a tired effort for a series that's quite clearly run out of steam and a slap in the face to the greatness of what it once was !",1,THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE,1396310400,"04 1, 2014",2014,2692,"['How', 'mighty', 'have', 'fallen', 'Homeland', 'seriously', 'way', '3rd', 'year', 'mainly', 'due', 'fact', 'most', 'key', 'storylines', 'were', 'resolved', 'end', 'season', '2', 'show', 'now', 'no', 'longer', 'anywhere', 'go', 'Therefore', 'let', 'just', 'lazily', 'repeat', 'what', ""'ve"", 'already', 'done', 'Carrie', 'back', 'nuthouse', 'mental', 'health', 'problems', 'Brody', 'locked', 'away', 'world', 'over', 'again', 'Let', 'also', 'waste', 'endless', 'screentime', 'Homeland', 'equivalent', '24', 'Kim', 'Bauer', 'ie', 'idiotic', 'daughter', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'do', 'main', 'storyline', 'let', 'keep', 'coming', 'up', 'absurd', 'plots', 'order', 'keep', 'involved', 'action', 'instead', 'just', 'dumping', 'irritating', 'brat', 'leaving', 'behind', 'writer', 'eventually', 'ended', 'up', 'doing', 'rest', 'Brody', 'family.There', 'was', 'talk', 'killing', 'Brody', 'character', 'off', 'end', 'season', '2', 'One', 'feeling', 'writer', 'regretted', 'not', 'making', 'decision', 'character', 'now', 'storyline', 'left', 'why', '2nd', 'lead', 'show', 'absent', 'season', 'what', 'are', 'left', 'instead', 'Endless', 'boring', 'scenes', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'guy', 'Amadeus', 'rooms', 'talking', 'plot', 'very', 'little', 'else', 'final', 'insult', 'trying', 'trick', 'viewer', 'believing', 'Brody', 'actually', 'dead', 'when', 'so', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'Brody', 'really', 'dead', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'actually', 'expire', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'body', 'afterwards', 'did', 'Abu', 'Nasir', 'Everyone', 'style', 'hanging', 'person', 'can', 'be', 'hanging', 'ages', 'actually', 'dying', 'how', 'convenient', 'plotwise', 'death', 'ages', 'happen', 'death', 'screen', 'body', 'be', 'shown', 'when', 'supposedly', 'happen', ""'m"", 'not', 'buying', 'Brody', 'really', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'die', 'why', ""n't"", 'put', 'affairs', 'order', 'beforehand', 'Muslim', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'making', 'peace', 'God', 'even', 'Sadam', 'Hussein', 'did', 'end', 'so-called', 'final', 'conversation', 'Carrie', 'why', ""n't"", 'simply', 'tell', 'take', 'care', 'baby', 'point', 'Brody', 'ever', 'behave', 'man', 'who', 'facing', 'death', 'lousy', 'writing', 'letting', 'scenes', 'down', 'reason', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'revealed', 'season', '4', 'Brody', ""n't"", 'actually', 'going', 'die', 'writer', 'have', 'tricked', 'making', 'think', 'Carrie', 'had', 'breakdown', 'when', 'really', 'Saul', 'masterplan', 'get', 'recruited', 'enemy', 'instead', 'fool', 'once', 'shame', 'fool', 'twice', 'All', 'tired', 'effort', 'series', 'quite', 'clearly', 'run', 'steam', 'slap', 'face', 'greatness', 'what', 'once', 'was']",Homeland: Season 3

HOW CAN YOU HAVE A SEASON 4 without brody!!! it was him carrie and saul that kept me watching and in particular the relationship between carrie and brody, even when they were apart. now that brody is dead how can they go on!!! they also seemed to have wrapped up everyones storie pretty much, where a season 4 isnt needed.

1671556,A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ,B00FGEO9NE,"L. Power ""nlp trainer""","[33, 41]","Like many people I loved the star crossed lover relationship between our bipolar CIA agent heroine Carrie Mathison with sloppy impulse control torn between her patriotism, and her unbridled attraction for the former marine Nicolas Brody kept captive for 8 years who might have been turned into a terrorist. By now you know what happened unless you like to put carts before horses, and season 3 begins with the aftermath of the major event of 12/12. Just when it seems like our two main characters might have a shot at a viable relationship, something always happens, like 12/12 bringing a Romeo and Juliet dimension to how the story unfolds.Now it's all change at the CIA as Saul (played by Mandy Patinkin) takes over. Carrie starts off making yet another dubious decision and Brody has now taken on the new role of most wanted fugitive. Carrie seems to be going even more downhill in dealing with her illness, and politicking at the CIA place Saul and his protege at odds.Homeland, according to IMDB has gained 35 wins from 57 award nominations winning Golden Globes Awards for Damian Lewis and Claire Danes as Best Actor and Actress, and also for Best television series.You are probably wondering how does season 3 compare to seasons 1 and 2. Homeland set the bar very high in seasons 1 and 2 with brilliant acting and storytelling. Can the series sustain its own high standards? I cannot say that season 3 is better only different. If the first season was the season of Carrie and the second season was the season of Brody, then the third season is the season of Saul, who shows himself to be an incredible strategist who makes extremely bold strategic moves which carry their own risks and do not necessarily sit well with people in high places, and could have dreadful repercussions if they don't work out.The program similarly takes very brave risks, so brave that one wonders where the series can go from here. There will be a season 4 which may seem surprising after what happens in season 3 which means the series has to entirely reinvent itself, and may indeed risk losing some loyal viewers because of choices made. But the creators of Homeland have surprised us in the past and I suspect will continue to do so.I liked season 3, and I think if you're like me and were addicted to seasons 1 and 2 then you have no choice but to watch season 3.

Its become so weird that its more watchable. Nothing really makes any sense at all but the the whole thing just keeps speeding up. You know watching in your heart that the train wreck is coming, but you just keep on watching.For those keeping track, we started out three years ago with Osama BL kidnapping and brainwashing an American soldier so that he could get even with Dick Cheney for killing one of his children. Insane CIA agent Carrie manages the the case so well that not only is the Vice President Cheney dead, but also CIA Headquarters is blown up.Carrie's love interest Brody, who murdered Dick Cheney (no big deal), is framed for blowing up the CIA building (a big deal). So now he is an innocent Vice Presidental assassin on the run accused of a bombing he didn't commit.The questions at the start of the season are:- Why the country isn't more appreciative of all that Carrie has accomplished?- Someone organized a plot to use Osama BL to brainwash an American Soldier into killing Dick Cheney so that the CIA would be distracted so that they could blow up CIA Headquarters. Who could have organized such a complex plot? The only clue we have is that the planner apparently had no particular follow-up plan after blowing Langley up.- Can our innocent vice presidental assassin prove that he is innocent of blowing up the CIA and become an all-American hero again?- What is day to day life like for the children of a Vice Presidental assassin who is falsely accused of planting a bomb at the CIA?I'm not going to bother to spoil the details of season three. It makes everything that came before just seem very simple and straightforward. Following the pattern, next season will probably feature the Russians as the paymasters behind the paymasters who blew up the CIA. Then season five will introduce the Chinese as the paymasters behind the paymasters behind the paymasters who blew up the CIA. Or maybe the guy with the cat who ran SPECTRE in the old James Bond films will turn out to be behind everything.Homeland.

The second season was very good, but not as exhilarating as the first. Without giving too much away, the third season was a bit disappointing for the first several episodes, leading to a shocking twist that really turned things into high-gear.Season 3 basically deals with Brody being on the run following the CIA bombing. His family (who we don't see much of all season) is struggling during the aftermath, as is Carrie, who has a little secret she doesn't let anyone in on for a while. Ultimately, Brody is offered a chance at redemption, and the latter half of the season focuses on his quest to achieve that. The final episode of the season, while shocking to some, was also expected, and I think will lead the show into a successful fourth season. You have to ask yourself, what is this show really about? It's not about Brody. It's not even really about Carrie.  It's called &#34;Homeland&#34; for a reason: the show is about this country's war on terror. With such superior writing, I'm sure the show can continue solidly next season missing one, and perhaps two of its central characters.

The rest was as good as any spy thriller gets. The ending is surprising but well thought out and essentially completes the story. The ending seemed to be a closure for the stories of the main characters, with no cliff hanger.There were some distinct plot holes including why the Iranian forces didn't shoot Carrie on the spot, and how the Iranians would explain why their hero Brody would assassinate the head of the Revolutionary guard without suspecting a CIA setup. Also, why would Carrie, the loose cannon, be promoted to Bureau chief in a sensitive location,after her employers locked her up in a mental institution and later on had her shot on orders?

Even the second season, while not quite as airtight, was still a treatise on political drama.  This third season, however, just lacked that &#34;eye of the tiger&#34; that often times is the only thing separating &#34;good&#34; from &#34;great&#34;.For a basic plot summary (and yes, some spoilers will be included here), Season Three begins with Carrie Matheson (Claire Danes) an absolute wreck after the CIA bombing at Langley.  With Brody (Damien Lewis) a wanted man, only Carrie can clear her name.  Of course, Saul Berensen (Mandy Patinkin) still makes all the big decisions...but for how long?  And, when an opportunity comes along to change the entire landscape of US/Middle East politics, is anything sacred in the pursuit of such a goal?(Another warning: the major spoilers will come in the next few paragraphs.  If you haven't watched this season than I strongly suggest waiting to read this review until you have, as it is more &#34;review&#34; than &#34;preview&#34;).I realize that the producers of &#34;Homeland&#34; have always insisted that &#34;the show is not about Brody&#34;, but the trouble is that they are wrong.  For most intents/purposes, this show only is fantastic when, indeed, it DOES have Brody at the center of things.  For example, the first season is so spectacular because (as a viewer) you just don't know what to make of Brody.  The same theme goes for season two, though changed to &#34;what will Brody do now?&#34;.  In this third season, viewers don't even see Brody until the third episode, and then don't hear from him again until episode 9!  That is too long for this show to stay &#34;on top&#34; without one of its shining stars.Granted, of course, that is not to say that other characters on this show are not superbly written.  Saul and Carrie are also great, and even Quinn (Rupert Friend) can be very interesting at times.  I know this next comment might completely turn my review off to some people, but I very much enjoyed the plotlines this season involving Dana Brody (Morgan Saylor).  Again, though, that is because I feel the show NEEDS a healthy dose of &#34;Brody&#34; in order to be special (instead of just &#34;good&#34;).Thus, this season of &#34;Homeland&#34; was, to me, just average.  It is still better than most fare on the tube these days (and, to be more specific, I can't recall a single political show post-24 to even come close to Homeland's stature in that category), but it wasn't nearly up to the quality of the previous two efforts.Of course, now that the &#34;big event&#34; at the end of the season has transpired, it almost feels (at least to a certain extent) that the show has wrapped.  Are there still loose ends to be tied up?  For sure.  But, going forward, Homeland will never quite be the same.  It will keep the same name and (hopefully) continue to produce taut political/human drama, but a significant turning point has been reached.  It will never be the &#34;good old days&#34; of Season One again, when every single episode was a tour de force.  I sincerely hope that the show creators can surprise me (and it's not like I'm &#34;bailing out&#34; yet), but I've seen too many shows go down this path and never recover.",3,"Loses The ""Eye of the Tiger""",1387238400,"12 17, 2013",2013,3370,"['almost', 'unfair', 'write', 'reviews', 'seasons', '34', 'Homeland', '34', 'first', 'season', 'may', 'be', 'single', 'greatest', 'season', 'T.V', 'show', 'ever', 'conceived', 'Even', 'second', 'season', 'not', 'quite', 'airtight', 'was', 'still', 'treatise', 'political', 'drama', 'third', 'season', 'however', 'just', 'lacked', '34', 'eye', 'tiger', '34', 'often', 'only', 'thing', 'separating', '34', 'good', '34', '34', 'great', '34', '.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'yes', 'spoilers', 'will', 'be', 'included', 'here', 'Season', 'Three', 'Carrie', 'Matheson', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'absolute', 'wreck', 'CIA', 'bombing', 'Langley', 'Brody', 'Damien', 'Lewis', 'wanted', 'man', 'only', 'Carrie', 'can', 'clear', 'name', 'course', 'Saul', 'Berensen', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'still', 'big', 'decisions', 'how', 'long', 'when', 'opportunity', 'along', 'change', 'entire', 'landscape', 'US/Middle', 'East', 'politics', 'anything', 'sacred', 'pursuit', 'such', 'goal', 'warning', 'major', 'spoilers', 'will', 'come', 'next', 'few', 'paragraphs', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'season', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'waiting', 'read', 'review', 'have', 'more', '34', 'review', '34', '34', 'preview', '34', '.I', 'realize', 'producers', '34', 'Homeland', '34', 'have', 'always', 'insisted', '34', 'show', 'not', 'Brody', '34', 'trouble', 'are', 'wrong', 'most', 'intents/purposes', 'show', 'only', 'fantastic', 'when', 'indeed', 'have', 'Brody', 'center', 'things', 'example', 'first', 'season', 'so', 'spectacular', 'because', 'viewer', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'make', 'Brody', 'same', 'theme', 'season', 'two', 'though', 'changed', '34', 'what', 'will', 'Brody', 'do', 'now', '34', 'third', 'season', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'Brody', 'third', 'episode', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'again', 'episode', '9', 'too', 'long', 'show', 'stay', '34', 'top', '34', 'one', 'shining', 'stars.Granted', 'course', 'not', 'say', 'other', 'characters', 'show', 'are', 'not', 'superbly', 'written', 'Saul', 'Carrie', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'even', 'Quinn', 'Rupert', 'Friend', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'times', 'know', 'next', 'comment', 'might', 'completely', 'turn', 'review', 'people', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'plotlines', 'season', 'involving', 'Dana', 'Brody', 'Morgan', 'Saylor', 'Again', 'though', 'feel', 'show', 'healthy', 'dose', '34', 'Brody', '34', 'order', 'be', 'special', 'instead', 'just', '34', 'good', '34', '.Thus', 'season', '34', 'Homeland', '34', 'was', 'just', 'average', 'still', 'better', 'most', 'fare', 'tube', 'days', 'be', 'more', 'specific', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'single', 'political', 'show', 'post-24', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'Homeland', 'stature', 'category', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'up', 'quality', 'previous', 'two', 'efforts.Of', 'course', 'now', '34', 'big', 'event', '34', 'end', 'season', 'transpired', 'almost', 'feels', 'least', 'certain', 'extent', 'show', 'wrapped', 'Are', 'still', 'loose', 'ends', 'be', 'tied', 'up', 'sure', 'going', 'forward', 'Homeland', 'will', 'never', 'quite', 'be', 'same', 'will', 'keep', 'same', 'name', 'hopefully', 'continue', 'produce', 'taut', 'political/human', 'drama', 'significant', 'turning', 'point', 'been', 'reached', 'will', 'never', 'be', '34', 'good', 'old', 'days', '34', 'Season', 'One', 'again', 'when', 'single', 'episode', 'was', 'tour', 'force', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'show', 'creators', 'can', 'surprise', 'not', ""'m"", '34', 'bailing', 'out', '34', 'yet', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'shows', 'go', 'down', 'path', 'never', 'recover']",Homeland: Season 3
