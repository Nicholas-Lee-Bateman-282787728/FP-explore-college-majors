I will watch anything that remotely qualifies as horror, but this movie doesn't even warrant someone's time or energy of placing it in a category.  The quality was on par with that of a 500$ cam-corder.  It was just unwatchable, I have no clue why any one would say that this movie is ok, or worse ""great"" or ""fun"".  Don't buy it, don't rent it. If some one offers to let you borrow it, slap them. I used to use customer reviews as criteria for buying movies, I guess I got reminded just how many stupid people there are out there.

The acting is worse than a junior high drama, the characters are totally unbelieveable.  The editing and directing make this movie so boring that you'll be lucky if you don't doze off.  The sad part is that the plot could have made a really great movie.  I've seen a lot of bad movies and usually they are good for even a few laughs, but this one got shut off halfway through and I should probably just burn the disc so no one else has a chance of accidently stumbling upon it and watching it.",1,Complete garbage,1175040000,"03 28, 2007",2007,564,"['love', 'B', 'movies', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'just', 'piece', 'garbage', 'acting', 'worse', 'junior', 'high', 'drama', 'characters', 'are', 'totally', 'unbelieveable', 'editing', 'directing', 'make', 'movie', 'so', 'boring', ""'ll"", 'be', 'lucky', 'do', ""n't"", 'doze', 'off', 'sad', 'part', 'plot', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'really', 'great', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'bad', 'movies', 'usually', 'are', 'good', 'even', 'few', 'laughs', 'one', 'got', 'shut', 'off', 'halfway', 'should', 'probably', 'just', 'burn', 'disc', 'so', 'one', 'else', 'chance', 'accidently', 'stumbling', 'watching']",Bit Parts
1034618,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000KJTFZC,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 3]","Bit Parts (Dave Reda, 2006)I have to say that when I watch microbudget horror films these days, I go into them not expecting much. It's a pessimistic policy, but not a terrible one; that way, when you come up with something really good, you're pleasantly surprised, and you're never too disappointed. I'd like to say that Bit Parts is something special-- another Deadbirds or something-- but it never quite gets to that level. Still, for the amateur production it obviously is, it surprised me in just about every way.The plot, as noted by All-Movie Guide, is a riff on Eyes Without a Face, Georges' Franju's 1959 thriller: after a car accident, a plastic surgeon (Christopher Page)'s daughter (Michelle Angel) is left horribly disfigured, and he lures innocent, beautiful girls to his home to use pieces of them to reconstruct his daughter's body. When Brenda Martin (Sarah Gordon) falls into the trap, her sister Melissa (Molly Fix) and the cab driver (played by Reda) who took her to the supposed movie audition from which she was kidnapped try to find her while she's still alive.It suffers all the problems one expects from a microbudget flick, but perhaps not as much as most; the acting isn't A-list, but it's surprisingly good for a production of this level. The script isn't as tight as it could be, but it's quick and grimly funny. The camerwork is of surprisingly high quality, and the music (supplied by Primus drummer Tim Alexander) fits in quite well. Yes, it's derivative and kind of silly, but that doesn't make it any less fun. Certainly worth killing an hour and a half with. ** ",3,"We likes it, precious.",1194825600,"11 12, 2007",2007,1597,"['Bit', 'Parts', 'Dave', 'Reda', '2006', 'have', 'say', 'when', 'watch', 'microbudget', 'horror', 'films', 'days', 'go', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'pessimistic', 'policy', 'not', 'terrible', 'one', 'way', 'when', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'really', 'good', ""'re"", 'pleasantly', 'surprised', ""'re"", 'never', 'too', 'disappointed', ""'d"", 'like', 'say', 'Bit', 'Parts', 'something', 'special', 'Deadbirds', 'something', 'never', 'quite', 'level', 'Still', 'amateur', 'production', 'obviously', 'surprised', 'just', 'way.The', 'plot', 'noted', 'All-Movie', 'Guide', 'riff', 'Eyes', 'Face', 'Georges', 'Franju', '1959', 'thriller', 'car', 'accident', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'Christopher', 'Page', 'daughter', 'Michelle', 'Angel', 'left', 'horribly', 'disfigured', 'innocent', 'beautiful', 'girls', 'home', 'use', 'pieces', 'reconstruct', 'daughter', 'body', 'When', 'Brenda', 'Martin', 'Sarah', 'Gordon', 'trap', 'sister', 'Melissa', 'Molly', 'Fix', 'cab', 'driver', 'played', 'Reda', 'who', 'took', 'supposed', 'movie', 'audition', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'try', 'find', 'still', 'alive.It', 'suffers', 'problems', 'one', 'microbudget', 'flick', 'perhaps', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'most', 'acting', ""n't"", 'A-list', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'production', 'level', 'script', ""n't"", 'as', 'tight', 'could', 'be', 'quick', 'grimly', 'funny', 'camerwork', 'surprisingly', 'high', 'quality', 'music', 'supplied', 'Primus', 'drummer', 'Tim', 'Alexander', 'quite', 'well', 'Yes', 'derivative', 'kind', 'silly', ""n't"", 'make', 'less', 'fun', 'Certainly', 'worth', 'killing', 'hour', 'half', '**']",Bit Parts
1034619,AGDD9T5BOHAOA,B000KJTFZC,"Ruggero Deodato ""Where Has HORROR GONE""","[6, 9]","BIT PARTSTAGLINE: THIS IS NO ORDINARY NIP & TUCKWhat the back DVD says:Dr. Cranston is a successful plastic surgeon in Los Angeles until his daughter is horribly disfigured in a car accident that he caused. To ease his remorse, he tirelessly labors to replace the magled features of his sweet Maggie. Wanting his daughter to be perfect, Dr. Cranston seeks women with the perfect nose, perfect eyes, or perfect breasts for his daughter.72 min's. Written by Jon Rosenberg produced and directed by Dave Reda who also stars in the movie.My viewpoint:AN INDIE FILM WITH SOME PROMISE OF FUTURE MASTERPIECES.The movie is a perfect Indie horror movie with some amazing written parts that have an original touch of humor and horror mixed together. The direction for a new comer to the movie world Dave Reda is by far some of the best I have seen when it comes to Indie horror movies. The acting is very strong at times and sometimes can be a little corny and bad. The over all aspect to the movie is a well put together first time approach.I was amazed at the opening. The dark approach and grainy feel to the camera lens gave it that realistic appeal to life. It was acted out like you and me who is reading This would be average people living out there lifes and going about there daily business.The makeup was not half bad. The low budget appeal could be seen at times but does not effect the over all outcome to the movie. I think the only bad things at times was the added cornyness to the story. Such as the daughter Maggie playing that spoiled little rich girl type feel, which at times got on my nerves. The other odd approach to the movie was the father, clearly insane and really the movie did nothing to explain how he was simply falling apart, but living at the same time, but what do you expect from a simple Indie low budget horror movie.I am floored at the original feel of this movie. It's a fun ride with so so acting and so so storyline. I would give it a watch to support Indie cinema, which is the most important thing any horror fan can do this day and age when it comes to the horror world. Rent it, buy it, spread the word so that Indie movies never die. The best thing a horror fan can do is pass up the big budget horror that tends to be trendy and just plain bad or so PG MPAA snore fest and give a new director the welcome mat into the horror world.For Indie Horror fans it's a great watch. Go into IT like approaching a low budget movie with a director and writer that love's horror and wished to make a half way decent movie. Buy it and support Indie Horror.AND NOW FOR A PERSONAL THOUGHT FOR HATERS OF INDIE HORROR:[...]",5,SUPPORT INDIE HORROR,1175126400,"03 29, 2007",2007,2641,"['BIT', 'PARTSTAGLINE', 'THIS', 'NO', 'ORDINARY', 'NIP', 'TUCKWhat', 'back', 'DVD', 'Dr.', 'Cranston', 'successful', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'daughter', 'horribly', 'disfigured', 'car', 'accident', 'caused', 'ease', 'remorse', 'tirelessly', 'replace', 'magled', 'features', 'sweet', 'Maggie', 'Wanting', 'daughter', 'be', 'perfect', 'Dr.', 'Cranston', 'women', 'perfect', 'nose', 'perfect', 'eyes', 'perfect', 'breasts', 'daughter.72', 'min', 'Written', 'Jon', 'Rosenberg', 'produced', 'directed', 'Dave', 'Reda', 'who', 'also', 'movie.My', 'viewpoint', 'AN', 'INDIE', 'FILM', 'WITH', 'SOME', 'PROMISE', 'OF', 'FUTURE', 'MASTERPIECES.The', 'movie', 'perfect', 'Indie', 'horror', 'movie', 'amazing', 'written', 'parts', 'have', 'original', 'touch', 'humor', 'horror', 'mixed', 'together', 'direction', 'new', 'comer', 'movie', 'world', 'Dave', 'Reda', 'far', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'when', 'Indie', 'horror', 'movies', 'acting', 'very', 'strong', 'times', 'sometimes', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'corny', 'bad', 'aspect', 'movie', 'well', 'together', 'first', 'time', 'approach.I', 'was', 'amazed', 'opening', 'dark', 'approach', 'grainy', 'feel', 'camera', 'gave', 'realistic', 'appeal', 'life', 'was', 'acted', 'out', 'who', 'reading', 'would', 'be', 'average', 'people', 'living', 'there', 'lifes', 'going', 'daily', 'business.The', 'makeup', 'was', 'not', 'half', 'bad', 'low', 'budget', 'appeal', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'times', 'not', 'effect', 'outcome', 'movie', 'think', 'only', 'bad', 'things', 'times', 'was', 'added', 'cornyness', 'story', 'Such', 'daughter', 'Maggie', 'playing', 'spoiled', 'little', 'rich', 'girl', 'type', 'feel', 'times', 'got', 'nerves', 'other', 'odd', 'approach', 'movie', 'was', 'father', 'clearly', 'insane', 'really', 'movie', 'did', 'nothing', 'explain', 'how', 'was', 'simply', 'falling', 'apart', 'living', 'same', 'time', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'simple', 'Indie', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'movie.I', 'am', 'floored', 'original', 'feel', 'movie', 'fun', 'ride', 'so', 'so', 'acting', 'so', 'so', 'storyline', 'would', 'give', 'watch', 'support', 'Indie', 'cinema', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'horror', 'fan', 'can', 'do', 'day', 'age', 'when', 'horror', 'world', 'Rent', 'buy', 'spread', 'word', 'Indie', 'movies', 'never', 'die', 'best', 'thing', 'horror', 'fan', 'can', 'do', 'pass', 'up', 'big', 'budget', 'horror', 'be', 'trendy', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'so', 'PG', 'MPAA', 'snore', 'fest', 'give', 'new', 'director', 'welcome', 'mat', 'horror', 'world.For', 'Indie', 'Horror', 'great', 'watch', 'Go', 'IT', 'approaching', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'director', 'writer', 'love', 'horror', 'wished', 'make', 'half', 'way', 'decent', 'movie', 'Buy', 'support', 'Indie', 'Horror.AND', 'NOW', 'A', 'PERSONAL', 'THOUGHT', 'FOR', 'HATERS', 'OF', 'INDIE', 'HORROR', '[', ']']",Bit Parts
