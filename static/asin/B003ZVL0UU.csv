Medina ""movie man""","[5, 17]","I recently saw this on display at J & R Music World in NYC and thought about buying it but then i rememberedMetallica's crappy performance and decided against it. Considering they make up 2 of the five hours of the release i'd just rather remember Slayer , Anthrax, and Megadeth'skiller performances during the live telecast.One of the other reviewers mentioned Dave from Megadeth having his voice overdubbed for this release. Terrible and cheap.Metallica was terrible because they sped up their songs (even the slow ones) and have lost their heaviness. Maybe they felt they had to try and catch up tempo-wise with the ret of the bill. Wrong move.Lars' drumming tempo was off too at times.You cant speed up the chorus of a song like 'Harvester of Sorrow' and make it sound good. My thought was - what's the rush? They could have played stuff at the regular tempowith some gusto and really had a killer performance. Oh well.I left the theater after seeing this and wondered how the other bands felt about them.

And the good hits like Angel of Death or War ensemble was ruined by Tom missing the lyrics, i mean, Slayer is not the kind of band that put the crowd to singing songs and less with such a song like Angel of Death. That's why i give this bluray concert 4 stars. Anyway, Seasong in the Abyss was their best, specially Dave with those drumbeats.And Metallica? what can i say? just as always very good, Blackened, Welcome Home,  Fade to Black, Hit the lights and the rest, just great, and when the other band members came into the stage to play Am i evil was an unforgettable moment that will remain in our thrash metal hearts.You have to buy this concert, no matter if you are a new or an old Metal fan, it's just great.",4,Just the best Thrash ones,1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,1685,"['Just', 'bought', '1000', 'watt', 'bluray', 'dvd', 'Sony', 'Home', 'theater', 'concert', 'video', 'audio', 'great', 'can', 'listen', 'guitar', 'base', 'drums', 'vocals', 'very', 'clear', '5.1', 'dts', 'HD', 'idea', 'play', 'big', '4', 'thrash', 'bands', 'together', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'knowing', 'i', 'grew', 'up', 'bands', 'back', 'early', '80s', 'watch', 'are', 'almost', 'same', 'members', 'watching', 'play', 'better', 'year', 'year', 'feel', 'very', 'good.Anthrax', 'Belladonna', 'openers', 'performance', 'very', 'well', 'setlist', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'then', 'Megadeth', 'rain', 'just', 'opened', 'Holy', 'Wars', 'turned', 'crowd', 'best', 'song', 'finished', 'Peace', 'Sells', 'great', 'hit.Slayer', 'favourite', 'four', 'i', 'was', 'i', 'little', 'disapointed', 'set', 'list', 'was', 'very', 'mediocre', 'World', 'Painted', 'blood', 'Jihad', 'hate', 'worldwide', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'songs', 'Chemical', 'Warfare', 'mmm', 'Black', 'magic', 'Antichrist', 'Show', 'mercy', 'Die', 'sword', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'good', 'hits', 'Angel', 'Death', 'War', 'ensemble', 'was', 'ruined', 'Tom', 'missing', 'lyrics', 'i', 'mean', 'Slayer', 'not', 'kind', 'band', 'put', 'crowd', 'singing', 'songs', 'less', 'song', 'Angel', 'Death', 'why', 'i', 'give', 'bluray', 'concert', '4', 'stars', 'Anyway', 'Seasong', 'Abyss', 'was', 'best', 'specially', 'Dave', 'drumbeats.And', 'Metallica', 'what', 'can', 'i', 'say', 'just', 'always', 'very', 'good', 'Blackened', 'Welcome', 'Home', 'Fade', 'Black', 'Hit', 'lights', 'rest', 'just', 'great', 'when', 'other', 'band', 'members', 'came', 'stage', 'play', 'Am', 'i', 'evil', 'was', 'unforgettable', 'moment', 'will', 'remain', 'thrash', 'metal', 'hearts.You', 'have', 'buy', 'concert', 'matter', 'are', 'new', 'old', 'Metal', 'fan', 'just', 'great']",N/A

Yeah, this is the show I would have given my first born (pharaoh) son to see back in the day, but in 2010, I'm just not that jazzed about it.What an idiot I turned out to be!  I sat through every minute of this thing and kept thinking, ""this is incredible!""  All the acts were great, and to try and rank them best to worst is impossible.  They all do their own distinct brand of thrash, and they all do it better than ANYONE.Some of my highlights:I've never seen a full live Slayer concert in person or even on a recording.  I don't think I ever really thought about that until I saw this.  Their set was absolutely BRUTAL!  Tom Araya literally has metal IN HIS BODY!  What more can you say about that?Metallica was solid as always, and you can tell those guys are really enjoying themselves up there.  I think this is the best Kirk's ever sounded, his performance was off the charts!Megadeth has always been one of my favorites, and I always go to their shows.  I've also probably seen about every piece of video footage there is on them.  This was no less amazing, although I don't get why they play the ending to Holy Wars twice.  Why would you do that?  I dunno, a small point, it just seems a little lazy to me.  And no one's ever accused Dave of having a great singing voice, or a great live guitar sound.And Anthrax with Joey Belladonna is the only way to go.  Some of those songs really took me back to some great memories.  I haven't heard ""I Am The Law"" in probably 20+ years.""Am I Evil?"" - there are no words.Loved. This.

I hate saying that because the man put his life back on track, but it seems to be at the expense of the band. They headline the show and, following Megadeth, had no choice but to rock out or else risk being upstaged by Mustaine.Slayer was incredible. You dont see much of them on Blu-Ray and you'll wonder why when you see them in Sofia.Megadeth was clean and clear as usual. Good to see Dave Mustaine on the same stage as the mighty Met. Kinda keeps the Met from slacking as Dave is truly talented and will guarantee a great performance every time he takes the stage. When Dave quit crying about getting his drunken, drugged out ass kicked out of Metallica and started focusing on being good, Megadeth became a great live band... A band that demands the headliner step up his/her game.The show opens with Anthrax and while my skateboarding days were over long ago, Anthrax was over before that! All I can say positive about them is, it's good to see they're still alive I guess.Unless editing dictated it, it would seem Metallica played a full set, while the other three were abbreviated somewhat. All four sound good in this and the video is good too (it's Blu-Ray, it'd better look good). It's a two disc set, with the first three on one disc and Metallica's set is all alone on the second disc.All in all, a definite great addition to the library.",5,Awesome Concert,1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,1510,"['Great', 'Concert', 'Sofia', 'Bulgaria.Not', 'bad', 'modern-day', 'Metallica', ""'ve"", 'really', 'fallen', 'off', 'James', 'quit', 'drinking', 'smoking', 'cursing', 'acting', 'fool', 'hate', 'saying', 'man', 'put', 'life', 'back', 'track', 'be', 'expense', 'band', 'headline', 'show', 'following', 'Megadeth', 'had', 'choice', 'rock', 'out', 'else', 'risk', 'being', 'upstaged', 'Mustaine.Slayer', 'was', 'incredible', 'dont', 'see', 'much', 'Blu-Ray', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'why', 'when', 'see', 'Sofia.Megadeth', 'was', 'clean', 'clear', 'usual', 'Good', 'see', 'Dave', 'Mustaine', 'same', 'stage', 'mighty', 'Met', 'Kinda', 'Met', 'slacking', 'Dave', 'truly', 'talented', 'will', 'guarantee', 'great', 'performance', 'time', 'stage', 'When', 'Dave', 'quit', 'crying', 'getting', 'drunken', 'drugged', 'out', 'ass', 'kicked', 'Metallica', 'started', 'focusing', 'being', 'good', 'Megadeth', 'became', 'great', 'live', 'band', 'band', 'headliner', 'step', 'up', 'his/her', 'game.The', 'show', 'Anthrax', 'skateboarding', 'days', 'were', 'over', 'long', 'ago', 'Anthrax', 'was', 'can', 'say', 'positive', 'good', 'see', ""'re"", 'still', 'alive', 'guess.Unless', 'editing', 'dictated', 'would', 'seem', 'Metallica', 'played', 'full', 'set', 'other', 'three', 'were', 'abbreviated', 'somewhat', 'four', 'sound', 'good', 'video', 'good', 'too', 'Blu-Ray', ""'d"", 'better', 'look', 'good', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'first', 'three', 'one', 'disc', 'Metallica', 'set', 'alone', 'second', 'disc.All', 'definite', 'great', 'addition', 'library']",N/A

1378339,A2R9CA3YT1WUNV,B003ZVL0UU,"Gentlegiantprog ""Kingcrimsonprog""","[10, 15]","First off let me qualify this review by observing that what you get out of this will entirely depend on your personality. If you've just discovered Dave Mustaine used to be in Metallica and tediously need to inform everyone on the internet you meet of this fact, well good for you. If you spend a medically unsafe amount of your time screaming the word `Slayer,' over and over again at support bands, in pubs or just generally in the street that's all well and good. (I may add that you are ruining it for the rest of us, moderate individuals who love Slayer but don't feel the need to be boorish and loud about it, but whatever, to each their own) Both of you types of people have already made your judgments before even watching.For the rest of the people out their who will treat this Blu Ray like any other and not lavish unfair amounts of scrutiny or praise on it due to peculiar flaws in the Metal community that sometimes cause preposterous rifts between Metallica and Megadeth, or those who like Slayer and only Slayer and feel the need to validate themselves by diminishing everything in the material universe that is not Slayer then this review is for you.You may be please to learn that this is not a simple cash in on the legacy of four of metals brightest stars, but a well made disc that would stand well without the nostalgia or cult status thrust upon it.The picture is pretty good if a little too grainy on close inspection but with generally good camera and editing work supporting this and in terms of sound quality there isn't much to complain about; the drums are particularly clear and well mixed.For the most part the crowd is pretty inaudible but that is fine as far as I am concerned, except when singers prompt the crowd to join in and it seems as if no one knows the words.The picture is in 1080i in 16:9 widescreen and you get a choice between Uncompressed PCM Stereo or DTS Master 5.1 Surround.There aren't an avalanche of extras but there is a fairly entertaining 45 minute documentary to nicely round out the package.In terms of individual performances each band plays very well, with the exception of the vocalists who seem to struggle a little at times but ultimately come out looking good, there are few if any musical mistakes and all the crowd favourites like `Raining Blood,' `Caught In A Mosh,' `Peace Sells...' and `Master of Puppets,' get an airing so few people will find themselves disappointed. Anthrax seem at times like they haven't fully got the crowd won over but deliver a strong performance anyway and win them over by the end.Megadeth play especially well but some people complain that it may be the case that Dave's vocals are overdubbed. (I have to say I didn't notice this myself, but its fair to warn you) and Metallica play very energetically if a little loose.All in all there is more good than band in every single performance and nothing that should upset all but the most pedantic of viewers.So, the product is good looking, good sounding, with energetic performances and pretty good value for money, this set certainly does have a lot of pros, the cons you'll be happy to learn are entirely conditional.Before you buy , the main question you need to ask yourself is `Do I really want this product?' and that is something to genuinely consider, because if like me you are a huge fan of every band involved and own DVDs and Blu Rays from their own catalogues then you may very well find this release wholly unnecessary.In terms of track listing, Metallica's very recent `Francais Pour Une Nuit,' release shares every track in common with the performance here with the exception only of `For Whom The Bell Tolls,' `Welcome Home (Sanitarium),' and a very short version of `Hit The Lights,'Anthrax similarly play every track of their set on their `Alive 2,' DVD to a more appreciative audience, bar the surprise addition of the John Bush era song `Only,' and about a minute or so from Black Sabbath's song `Heaven and Hell.'Megadeth's set in its entirety has been represented on numerous other DVDs with the sole exception of `Headcrusher.'Only Slayer break the trend however by playing a full half of their set devoted to music this side of the millennium.If you have never bought a DVD or Blu Ray from any of these bands then I recommend this wholeheartedly, you do get an hour from each band of classic high quality thrash metal in high definition for, all in one place for a good price.If you haven't owned any DVDs by at least one of the bands then it is still something you should consider. Finally, if like me the big four are just genuinely four of your favourite bands then of course, you should buy this, just being aware that you aren't going to get much that you haven't seen before.Comment",4,A moderate opinion,1289865600,"11 16, 2010",2010,4757,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'qualify', 'review', 'observing', 'what', 'get', 'will', 'entirely', 'depend', 'personality', ""'ve"",

If you are wondering why i am not including Slayer is because the fans did not seem to like them as well, and I was very disappointed that they did not take the stage with Metallica Anthrax and Megadeth to do the song Am I Evil?  James Hetfield states that he is bringing out all the bands but it was very clear to me that neither Tom Araya, nor Kerry King were on stage with the other bands.  To me this was just disrespectful, so I now have a new reason to dislike Slayer.Okay on to the other 3 acts.  Anthrax performs with (original?  depends on how familiar you are with the band) lead singer -- Joey Belladonna.  Joey does a great job on all the classic Anthrax tracks except ""Only"".  To me that is why Anthrax was a better stage band with John Bush than Joey, but that is just an opinion.Megadeth is next.  MINDBLOWING!!!!  I have always liked Megadeth, but thought Metallica was a slightly better band; however, after watching both acts, I am not sure who is really better.  Both Metallica and Megadeth took to the stage like they owned it.  The Bulgaria crowd was even into both bands heavily.  I do not think I have ever seen a better performance from Megadeth (and I have seen them a lot.)  Plus as an added bonus Unlike Metallica, even the songs I like least by Megadeth sounded great live.  If not for the antics of Metallica on stage Megadeth would have been the best band of the concert.  To top it all off Megadeth did this during a storm.Slayer I only watched a few minutes of, then placed in the Metallica disc, so I will not rate their performance.  If you are a fan of Slayer I am sure you will like them, But the only song I have ever liked by them is ""War Ensemble""Metallica is better (in some ways) than they have been in years (because of Bass Player Robert Trujillo), but there is one problem.  Being a former Drummer, I could tell Lars was not playing the same Drum kit he had for years.  There was certain tones (for lack of a better word) that felt like they were missing or altered.  Again that is just one person's perspective.  One other thing that I did not care for were the songs ""Nothing Else Matters"" and ""Cyanide"" (again that is just a personal preference).  I would have preferred to see Lars with a Larger drum kit and performing the song ""and Justice For All"" in place of the two I disliked.Overall a great concert!  Buy it on DVD or Blu Ray because they are only scheduled (so far) to play one date in the USA.",5,Who is better Megadeth or Metallica?

1378341,A32IVQINWXFOXC,B003ZVL0UU,"H. P. Keable ""more bass!""","[0, 1]","IMHO, Metallica only has two things over Megadeth....Hetfield's amazing and instantly recognizable voice, and the fact that Metallica has always been more of a ""band"" than Megadeth.  James, Lars & Kirk have managed to stay together all these years while Dave has had a large number of partners in that same time frame.  Not that each lineup hasn't been great, cuz it has, but Metallica just projects a more cohesive identity as a band.  That said, Megadeth is much more interesting in the guitar department with always having two really good players, while Metallica relies pretty much totally on Hammett.  And then of course there's the key element in every band, the writing.  Metallica's writing is very, very good, but Mustaine's writing is just...better!  More creative, more diverse, even more emotional.  I mention all of this cuz it was impossible not to compare these two giants of this genre while watching this DVD set.  I like Anthrax well enough, but they're just not in the same league.  Joey Belladonna seemed to struggle a bit here and there.  And Slayer.....well, what can you say about Slayer.  I will give them props for still being the the top dog of the thrash idiom after two decades (the only band of the four that you could really still call thrash), but Mustaine  was quoted some years ago as saying ""boycott noise metal"", and I think that pretty much says it all for me.  Dave Lomabardo was very interesting to watch though.  Almost seems like he's too good to be in Slayer.Mustaine was in really great voice for this show, and Chris Broderick was the hottest soloist of all four bands to my ears.

1378342,A2KTUL1TPTGWIX,B003ZVL0UU,"Jack Treese ""Jack""","[0, 0]","When I bought the DVD, I had very low expectations for it.  I've seen each of these bands live (except for Anthrax) already and a lot of reviewers on here were biased against Megadeth, so I wasn't expecting much.Anthrax's set was amazing.  Very easily could've stolen the show.  Then again, it's hard to say who did because it was great seeing these four bands on the same stage.  After their set, Megadeth played.  I said people were being biased because I thought Megadeth had some of the better performances from the entire concert.  Whether you're a fan of his or not, you gotta hand it to Dave Mustaine for being able to shred while doing so much touring.Then, we move on to Slayer's set.  Y'know, it's really funny that people wrote such mean things about Megadeth being on this set because I thought out of all the bands, Slayer's set was the most disappointing.  Sounded very mudded out, and Tom Araya just didn't seem to have it in him that night.  I understand he had recently underwent back surgery, so that's probably why.  I'm not saying they entirely sucked, they had a few songs that were very powerful to see them perform.  However, I expected better.Then of course, the almighty Metallica.  Their set was so long, it coulda very well been a separate DVD release.  Instead, they got their own disc on this set and quite honestly, their performance is enhanced thanks to that.  The video doesn't seem as compressed, and the audio sounds very tight.  Therefore, every bit of their performance was caught and every strum of the guitar sounded as crisp as the last.To me, the highlight of this concert was the performance of ""Am I Evil?"" at the end of Metallica's set.  No matter what paths all the bands went down or up, at the end of the day they're all fighting for the cause of metal!  I think that's what biased people do; they forget about the music in favor of egos.All of these bands are amazing in their own right.  If you agree, then you owe it to yourself to own this.  If you don't agree, then buy ""Rust in Peace"" by Megadeth, ""South of Heaven"" by Slayer,  ""Among the Living"" by Anthrax, and ""Master of Puppets"" by Metallica and get yourselves acquainted with some REAL music!",5,"Excellent, historical milestone concert for anyone who loves HEAVY",1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,2200,"['When', 'bought', 'DVD', 'had', 'very', 'low', 'expectations', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'bands', 'live', 'Anthrax', 'already', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'here', 'were', 'biased', 'Megadeth', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much.Anthrax', 'set', 'was', 'amazing', 'Very', 'easily', 'could', ""'ve"", 'stolen', 'show', 'Then', 'again', 'hard', 'say', 'who', 'did', 'was', 'great', 'seeing', 'four', 'bands', 'same', 'stage', 'set', 'Megadeth', 'played', 'said', 'people', 'were', 'being', 'biased', 'thought', 'Megadeth', 'had', 'better', 'performances', 'entire', 'concert', ""'re"", 'fan', 'not', 'got', 'ta', 'hand', 'Dave', 'Mustaine', 'being', 'able', 'shred', 'doing', 'so', 'much', 'touring.Then', 'move', 'Slayer', 'set', ""Y'know"", 'really', 'funny', 'people', 'wrote', 'such', 'mean', 'things', 'Megadeth', 'being', 'set', 'thought', 'bands', 'Slayer', 'set', 'was', 'most', 'disappointing', 'Sounded', 'very', 'mudded', 'out', 'Tom', 'Araya', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'night', 'understand', 'had', 'recently', 'underwent', 'back', 'surgery', 'probably', 'why', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'entirely', 'sucked', 'had', 'few', 'songs', 'were', 'very', 'powerful', 'see', 'perform', 'However', 'expected', 'better.Then', 'course', 'almighty', 'Metallica', 'set', 'was', 'so', 'long', 'very', 'well', 'been', 'separate', 'DVD', 'release', 'Instead', 'got', 'own', 'disc', 'set', 'quite', 'honestly', 'performance', 'enhanced', 'thanks', 'video', ""n't"", 'seem', 'compressed', 'audio', 'very', 'tight', 'Therefore', 'bit', 'performance', 'was', 'caught', 'strum', 'guitar', 'sounded', 'as', 'crisp', 'last.To', 'highlight', 'concert', 'was', 'performance', 'Am', 'Evil', 'end', 'Metallica', 'set', 'matter', 'what', 'bands', 'went', 'down', 'up', 'end', 'day', ""'re"", 'fighting', 'cause', 'metal', 'think', 'what', 'biased', 'people', 'do', 'forget', 'music', 'favor', 'egos.All', 'bands', 'are', 'amazing', 'own', 'right', 'agree', 'then', 'owe', 'yourself', 'own', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'then', 'buy', 'Rust', 'Peace', 'Megadeth', 'South', 'Heaven', 'Slayer', 'Living', 'Anthrax', 'Master', 'Puppets', 'Metallica', 'get', 'yourselves', 'acquainted', 'REAL', 'music']",N/A

1378346,A1NF9WS7RR82MX,B003ZVL0UU,J. Hill,"[3, 3]","I definitely had no chance of being in Europe this past summer for the Big 4 tour, and none of my local movie theaters carried the live feed from the Sofia concert featured on these DVD's.  When I first heard about this tour earlier this year, I could hardly believe it would happen, and even though I did peek at some of the performances online, I knew the DVD's would come along eventually so I've been waiting for the chance to experience a full show for myself. I'm happy to report that my enthusiasm for this gathering was never in vain, and that the performances, the crowd, and the atmosphere of the entire event gave me chills. The bands are in top form, the crowd is insane to say the least, and there is a magical air to this shameless celebration of the past. Yes, some new material is present, but the crowd and the bands are noticeably more energized on the 80's and early 90's material, when the Big 4 were still the Big 4. And not to belabor the point, but the crowd is so loud and into the music, singing along, chanting, clapping, roaring, it would be hard not to share their enjoyment. All of these musicians have been around for decades, so I have to admit that I had my doubts about whether they could pull off something that would recapture the old times, but I for one am satisfied with what I hear and see on this DVD. Here are what I see as a few highlights of the individual bands.Anthrax--They get the crowd pumped from the start with an adrenaline-fueled Caught In A Mosh, and it never lets up. I have to say that even though Anthrax has been through some silliness over who's singing for them, it's great to see Joey running around the stage and belting out the old favorites like it's 1988. His voice sounds great to me, and his stage antics haven't changed a bit. The give-and-take between the band and crowd is probably the strongest of any of the bands, as Anthrax are true crowd-pleasers. The set list is all old material, unless you count Only as new. It's the only John Bush song, anyway. Individually, Be All, End All and Indians/Heaven and Hell are stand-out performances. Anthrax left thrash behind for awhile, but it looks like they've returned full force if this show is any indication of their future.Megadeth--They play more of their post-Rust In Peace catalogue than fans of their early thrash albums will care for, but the crowd seems to enjoy every moment. I would've loved to see them play something from Killing Is My Business, like the title track, or Rattlehead, or Mechanix. But, Mustaine is probably the most talented musician of the night; his fingers look like a piano player's as they race up and down the fretboard. He doesn't have much to say to the crowd during the set, but not even some torrential downpours can stop them from going crazy throughout every song; on a couple of songs, they actually chant louder than the band is playing. They especially seem to love the Rust In Peace and Peace Sells songs, which are my favorites, too, along with In My Darkest Hour and Hook In Mouth. Headcrusher from the new album gets a great reaction, as well.Slayer--I've seen more live Slayer than any of the Big 4, from the multiple concerts I've been to, to their live albums and DVD's. So other than the World Painted Blood songs and Jihad, I've seen these songs live many times. Slayer is still Slayer, as they've always been, and everyone knows they've changed the least out of these bands over the years. One thing I like a lot is that the songs World Painted Blood and Beauty Through Order are much more potent live than on the CD, and sound more like they fit in with older songs. I also like hearing Dave Lombardo playing drums on Disciple, which somehow makes it sound more like an older Slayer song. Tom, just like Joey and Scott from Anthrax and Dave Mustaine, seems at times in awe of the crowd, which is thunderous during Raining Blood. An amazing visual comes from this set, as the weather clears after the Megadeth set, and during Chemical Warfare, you get an amazing shot from behind Jeff Hanneman of the crowd, the horizon, and the sky. I won't try to describe what it looks like, but it's breathtaking.Metallica--Just like with Slayer, I've seen tons of live Metallica stuff over the years, and you get what you'd expect from a Metallica show as far as the staples are concerned. Musically, they sound as good as they ever have, and vocally, James still hasn't had that gruff, sometimes vicious tone to his voice since And Justice For All. He sounds fine in this concert, but I don't always like hearing songs like Harvester of Sorrow done with clean vocals. Besides that, I thought the inclusion of songs like Harvester, Blackened, and Hit the Lights offered an older flavor to the show with songs I haven't seen performed a hundred times. Also to that end is the fact that no songs from Load or St. Anger made the cut, which I don't think you'll hear many metal fans complaining about. The crowd response to show opener Creeping Death is one of those awesome, spine-tingling moments that sets the tone for the incredible energy the audience maintains for the rest of Metallica's set. For two hours, nobody from the back to the front of the massive crowd stands still for a second, and not a single person fails to contribute to the wall of backing noise behind each song.After highlights that include the aforementioned songs, an incredible pyro show introducing One, and the heavier, thrashier edge the Death Magnetic songs have live, the night concludes with possibly the greatest encore in metal history, when Metallica returns to the stage a few minutes after Enter Sandman. As any metal fan knows and has already watched online, all four bands join forces onstage and jam to Am I Evil, something that should be seen and savored by anyone who has ever listened to heavy metal music. The sight of Dave Mustaine playing alongside Metallica again is something I thought I'd never see, but it happened, and it was awesome. After the historic jam, Metallica finishes the show with supercharged renditions of Hit the Lights and Seek and Destroy, wrapping up a legendary event in vintage fashion. Like I said, this show is a celebration of metal music, the past, and the fans, and I'm glad I finally got to see it.These DVD's capture a very special event, and I think anyone who likes these bands would enjoy them tremendously.  I've shown clips to a few people who don't even  like metal, and they had to admit the atmosphere is electric.  The connection between the bands and the huge crowd is a spectacle to behold.  If you were ever into these bands, this is a show you should see.",5,Worth the Wait,1299974400,"03 13, 2011",2011,6651,"['definitely', 'had', 'chance', 'being', 'Europe', 'past', 'summer', 'Big', '4',

I have some discs of other performances by these bands that I can say are truly better. The Megadeth performance: Raining on the crowd, crowd doesn't get into the show as much due to this which drains the energy of the show.  Slayer Performance: Halfway decent other than Tom Araya skipping lyrics and trying to get the crowd to sing along instead of him doing the singing - and also rain. Metallica performance: Lars misses beats and sometimes can barely keep up with the songs. Things just don't gel as much with the Metallica show as much as the ""Francais Pour Une Nuit"" blu ray (get this one if you want to see a good show).  The camera work was pretty amateurish at times.

Brockwell ""William Brockwell""","[1, 2]","What is sure to be a timeless classic to metal fans in no time is the Big four dvd of the first Thrash/Speed Metal bands I'm talking about Anthrax, Megadeth, Slayer, and finally the one the only METALLICA!!! Ok where should i start first? I purchased this dvd for two reasons Metallica and Megadeth are two of my favorite metal bands ever! 2nd reason you are plain and simply no Metal fan if you don't buy this case and point. I love thrash metal I think personally it is the best style in Heavy Metal music and with this dvd you cant go wrong there. Lets break it down performance by performance here first up Anthrax played a great set they sounded good got the crowd going very early and i like how the played Heaven and Hell a personal tribute to the late great Ronnie James Dio that was awesome i enjoyed that. 2nd Megadeth you can say what you want to even with the rain falling during their set they still ripped it up!! I love the setlist the boys played Dave Mustaine just continues to blow me away with his guitar playing skills in my opionion they had the second best performance on here. Now Slayer well don't get me wrong I love Slayer but this performance was most likely the least best on this dvd. With that being said the guitars drowned out the vocals and bass like always. But the Raining Blood performance was killer tho!! Now Metallica what can i say the most sucessful Metal band of all time always bring their A game to live shows and with this one it does not dissapoint not as good as the Orgullo, Pasion, Y Gloria dvd but still def worth checking out if you are a die hard Metallica like me. I wonder why Metallica always choose to open every show with Creeping Death? Don't get me wrong its an awesome song but i wish they would mix their setlist up a little too simiar to the Orgullo, Pasion, Y Gloria three nights in Mexico dvd. I loved this performance i loved the songs and the stage effects like the pyro and fireworks especially during the song One. I think with all the constant touring James Hetfields voice is wearing out i noticed it a few times with this dvd i hope and pray to God thats not the case. Bottom line if you love Thrash Metal or any of these bands listed this is the dvd for you I also love how all four bands jammed the Diamond Head song Am I evil during the Metallica set that was awesome!! And i love how Dave Mustaine hangs out with Lars, James and Kirk Hammett (Beleive it or not) see Dave just goes to show even what happened in the past doesnt mean the boys in Metallica are not your friends anymore.

1378356,ACG9VLB5JCN1D,B003ZVL0UU,"Quiet Summer ""SummerKY""","[81, 82]","This is a review for the blu-ray 2 disc set.  On the first disc you get Anthrax, followed by Megadeth and then Slayer's set.  On the second disc you get the Metallica set and the bonus features.  I will break down the setlists at the bottom of the review.First the sound is amazing in my opinion, as is the picture.  I thought the overall mix on all four sets was really good.  I've read the one review about Mustaine's vocals, I didn't notice it, so can't really comment on whether it has or hasn't been remixed.  It wasn't a concern for me personally.The bonus features include a behind the sccenes documentary which includes interviews and a peak at the Am I Evil? rehearsal backstage which is just good fun.  I like back stage stuff and interviews so I dig that extra feature.So for the bulk features of this ""product""  I give it five stars, good picture, good sound, bonus features are nice added touch.  I couldnt really find a reason to deduct any stars based on the product.  The camera shots are typical concert fodder, close stage center, back stage left, over the crowd, close up floating over crowd and behind the band looks. I appreciate the traditional camera shots, I am not really a fan of the waving, roving camera techniques where you flashy, quick looks and can't follow anything.  I like to get long shots of the guitar when there are solos etc. So , I was happy with the way this was shot.Now for my personal opinions.  I was very happy with the setlists for Megadeth and Metallica.  Megadeth didn't waste time chatting, they went from song to song and really delivered.  I've seen Megadeth live many times and they are always incredible, this is no exception, what really got me going for the Megadeth set was the guitar, those riffs are just so amazing, and Chris Broderick is an amazing addition to this lineup.  His live performances with Nevermore were astounding and when he joined Megadeth I wondered if it would be enough for a guitarist of his caliber.  Clearly it is, he is having a blast.I was unhappy with Slayer's setlist.  I have seen Slayer live and they are really worth seeing.  Songs like World Painted Blood, Jihad, Hate Worldwide, Beauty Through Order would have been better replaced with Dead Skin Mask (I can't believe they didn't play this one), Expendable Youth, Die by the Sword.  Too bad, but again, this is just my preference.  I really recommend the double live CD Decade of Aggression.  It's an amazing set of songs.Metallica setlist mirrors their previous blu-ray release.  I think it's a solid set of songs and they sounded very good, the mix is great.  This is when you see all the guys coming together and perform together and that is alot of fun.  I've seen Metallica live every tour since 1986 and I can say this past tour has had some great setlists.  I could have done without N.E.M., but hey the crowd loved it.  If you have any questions I'll try to answer them.((***Side ponder***  I wondered who decided what order the bands should perform in?  I found it curious to have Megadeth perform before Slayer as they are more widely known.))If you dig all four, or one or two of these bands, this is worth owning and was alot of fun to watch.AnthraxCaught in a MoshGot the TimeMadhouseBe All, End AllAntisocialIndians/Heaven and HellMedusaOnlyMetal Thrashing MadI Am The LawMegadethHoly WarsHangar 18Wake Up DeadHead CrusherIn My

1378357,AOZLTHXD6MDBJ,B003ZVL0UU,Red Ball Jets,"[7, 10]","I read lots of mixed reviews on this DVD. Most seemed to slam Megadeth and praise Anthrax and Metallica so I wasn't sure what to expect but I figured considering the price of the DVD and 4 bands, there's gonna be somewhere I'll get my money's worth?In some cases, negative reviews come from the fans themselves complaining about two songs they thought should have been played but didn't or a drum solo in the middle, a medley or whatever.Well, we've watched this video 9 times and here's the verdict and out of all four bands, I favor no one band over another so this is completely un-biased.Overall, this DVD won't disappoint. It's very entertaining. The lighting and camera work are first rate.I'm going to assume each band was given the opportunity in the final mix of the music because every band sounds different.Anthrax and Megadeth had the most balanced sound. Slayer was very thin and sounded awful and Lars wanted to make sure the world heard his awful (and off time) drumming loud and clear over the rest of the band in Metallica's set.Vocals - I think all the singers struggled... I'd give the nod to Mustaine out of the 4 and I've never been a Mustaine fan.Overall performance - Megadeth hand's down ACED it... Anthrax had a very tight set too. Metallica at times had difficulty keeping time and James struggled with the vocals. Slayer's performance itself was good but was overshadowed by poor sound and an aged singer.James Hetfield made a good point towards the end of the video. He said, ""we've been around almost 30 years"" and he's right. These guys aren't 20 year old kids anymore and at some points it shows.I'd suggest buying this video, I think there's something in it that could entertain everybody...

It's supposed to be a celebration of ""The Big Four"" but it left me wanting to watch more Anthrax. Mainly because they sound incredible and you know for a fact your getting the live feed without any trickery. Everything sounded like you were sitting right in front as it should. All the guys are having a blast and are on top of their game. What a shame they didn't get more time and at night but this is good enough because they schooled everyone else. Every song sounded great and it was a good even surprising mix of what I apparently never heard with the exception of I am the Law, Indians etc.. It was a good sounded diverse set with a hint of Punk from the bass player and a nice thoughtful and brilliantly played Heaven An Hell. I've watched their performance 4 times now and still love it.Megadeth:My favorite band out of the four put on a brilliantly played musical set. You can instantly tell from the Anthrax performance and sound quality that Megadeth had a totally different sound going on. More ""tinny"" Musically and sonically it sounded GREAT but Dave Mustains vocals RUINED the performance. I have seen a lot of Megadeth performances and he usually can pull it off.. sometimes he sounds great, sometimes not but this performance was AWFUL. He usually overdubs the official releases but apparently he didn't have much control over this one. I've read others who say the overdubs suck but unfortunate this is an overdub issue.. This is a vocal issue with Dave.He needs to seek medical attention or do different songs because this falsetto he's doing sounds silly and embarrassing to sit here and watch it. He seems to really struggle with the higher register.. almost as if he's lost the back of his vocal chords.. I think the rain during their set was a message to the band to get Dave some help or hang it up. Watch it once and it's so embarrassing to see much less hear you will shrink back into your couch. the boys in the back must have been like wtf???Slayer:Couldn't hear them.. too damn muddy and the guitars are WAY in the back of the mix.. maybe these guys should get some better gear so we can really hear them? but they looked cool...Metallica:Same ole... What are you going to say? It sounded good but I heard Lars screw up a couple times but no biggie..It was Metallica and it's the same songs we've heard over and over..So in the end I have to say it's worth it from a historical perspective and the added bonus of Anthrax schooling all the pro's that night.. well done",5,"Historical, Must have for Anthrax alone",1289088000,"11 7, 2010",2010,2744,"['was', 'never', 'big', 'fan', 'Anthrax', 'mostly', 'never', 'really', 'listened', 'back', 'then', 'performance', 'made', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'take', 'better', 'listen.Anthrax', 'opinion', 'Anthrax', 'show', 'night', 'watching', 'DVD', 'supposed', 'be', 'celebration', 'Big', 'Four', 'left', 'wanting', 'watch', 'more', 'Anthrax', 'Mainly', 'sound', 'incredible', 'know', 'fact', 'getting', 'live', 'feed', 'trickery', 'Everything', 'sounded', 'were', 'sitting', 'right', 'front', 'should', 'guys', 'are', 'having', 'blast', 'are', 'top', 'game', 'What', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'time', 'night', 'good', 'enough', 'schooled', 'everyone', 'else', 'Every', 'song', 'sounded', 'great', 'was', 'good', 'even', 'surprising', 'mix', 'what', 'apparently', 'never', 'heard', 'exception', 'am', 'Law', 'Indians', 'etc..', 'was', 'good', 'sounded', 'diverse', 'set', 'hint', 'Punk', 'bass', 'player', 'nice', 'thoughtful', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Heaven', 'Hell', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'performance', '4', 'times', 'now', 'still', 'love', 'it.Megadeth', 'favorite', 'band', 'four', 'put', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'musical', 'set', 'can', 'instantly', 'tell', 'Anthrax', 'performance', 'sound', 'quality', 'Megadeth', 'had', 'totally', 'different', 'sound', 'going', 'More', 'tinny', 'Musically', 'sonically', 'sounded', 'GREAT', 'Dave', 'Mustains', 'vocals', 'RUINED', 'performance', 'have', 'seen', 'lot', 'Megadeth', 'performances', 'usually', 'can', 'pull', 'off..', 'sometimes', 'great', 'sometimes', 'not', 'performance', 'was', 'AWFUL', 'usually', 'overdubs', 'official', 'releases', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'control', 'one', ""'ve"", 'read', 'others', 'who', 'say', 'overdubs', 'suck', 'unfortunate', 'overdub', 'issue..', 'vocal', 'issue', 'Dave.He', 'seek', 'medical', 'attention', 'do', 'different', 'songs', 'falsetto', 'doing', 'sounds', 'silly', 'embarrassing', 'sit', 'here', 'watch', 'really', 'struggle', 'higher', 'register..', 'almost', 'lost', 'back', 'vocal', 'chords..', 'think', 'rain', 'set', 'was', 'message', 'band', 'get', 'Dave', 'help', 'hang', 'up', 'Watch', 'once', 'so', 'embarrassing', 'see', 'much', 'less', 'hear', 'will', 'shrink', 'back', 'couch', 'boys', 'back', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'wtf', 'Slayer', 'Could', ""n't"", 'hear', 'them..', 'too', 'damn', 'muddy', 'guitars', 'are', 'WAY', 'back', 'mix..', 'maybe', 'guys', 'should', 'get', 'better', 'gear', 'can', 'really', 'hear', 'looked', 'cool', 'Metallica', 'Same', 'ole', 'What', 'are', 'going', 'say', 'sounded', 'good', 'heard', 'Lars', 'screw', 'up', 'couple', 'times', 'biggie..It', 'was', 'Metallica', 'same', 'songs', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'over..So', 'end', 'have', 'say', 'worth', 'historical', 'perspective', 'added', 'bonus', 'Anthrax', 'schooling', 'pro', 'night..', 'well', 'done']",N/A
