Just hearing Ella sing ""Sweet Georgia Brown"" on this DVD makes me feel glad to be alive . She takes a lot of chances whilst singing and obviously loves what she's doing .She doesn't ignore the audience like some jazz performers do .One reviewer wrote that Ella was past her prime when this was recorded . If so , I would rather she was still around as not many other current singers do it for me like Ella does .Most record companies have big marketing budgets , but are the 'artists' worth your hard earned ?Picasso was an artist , like Ella . They communicate .Without needing to dance .If you love great singing , this will give you goosebumps .

Ella was still swinging strong in '79; some say she was actually at the apex of her career, and this performance is fine support for that argument.The title *is* misleading, as Count Basie is only stage for a few numbers, but for my money this is worth it just to have one of the best Ella performances ever in your personal library.

That proof was solely the result of Norman Granz' Montreux Jazz Festival, of which this was but a small part. Oscar surfaces on other videos of the festival, but this one is special to me because it brings alive an album I own of most of the same performance in this video:Live-Montreux '77.Unlike that album, this is extended by over fifteen minutes because Oscar starts the set solo on Falling in Love with Love, Old Folks and Indiana. Each piece was breathtaking as far as I am concerned. But Peterson has that effect on me. I never time of listening to his virtuoso playing.He is then joined by Ray Brown with whom he had been playing since the early 1950s, and Niels-Henning rsted Pedersen ('The Great Dane with the never ending name, (A.K.A. NHP), a bassist for whom Peterson had the utmost respect. Then the show truly begins.I was mesmerized by every song that followed because the the distinct contrasts in Brown's and NHP's approach to playing. I love Brown's growling bass, but also love the cleaner notes from Pedersen's instrument - and the way each approached the music itself.  Some folks have complained that the camera did not capture the minute details of Oscar's hands. That may be so, but this is as much about bassists as it is about Oscar, and for bassists this is a treasure.  To counterbalance the complaints, the camera did capture Oscar's hands in frequent shots, but not close in.It's the music that counts, and while this is a visual feast, it's the sound that makes it wonderful. Granted, the sound quality is a but under par, but is stillsufficiently good that you can enjoy the video.If there is a single lament this video does not contain the last song in the performance - Soft Winds - which is on the CD I cited. It is a small trade-off because the CD does not contain the first three songs that Oscar performed solo before being joined by Brown and Pedersen. Besides, I consider myself fortunate to own both this video and the album. It's a remarkable work for any fan or musician.",5,Pure magic,1370044800,"06 1, 2013",2013,2123,"['1959', 'was', 'year', 'changed', 'jazz', '1977', 'was', 'year', 'proved', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'kicking', 'proof', 'was', 'solely', 'result', 'Norman', 'Granz', 'Montreux', 'Jazz', 'Festival', 'was', 'small', 'part', 'Oscar', 'surfaces', 'other', 'videos', 'festival', 'one', 'special', 'alive', 'album', 'own', 'most', 'same', 'performance', 'video', 'Live-Montreux', 'album', 'extended', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'Oscar', 'set', 'solo', 'Falling', 'Love', 'Love', 'Old', 'Folks', 'Indiana', 'piece', 'was', 'breathtaking', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'Peterson', 'effect', 'never', 'time', 'listening', 'virtuoso', 'playing.He', 'then', 'joined', 'Ray', 'Brown', 'whom', 'had', 'been', 'playing', 'early', '1950s', 'Niels-Henning', 'rsted', 'Pedersen', 'Great', 'Dane', 'never', 'ending', 'name', 'A.K.A', 'NHP', 'bassist', 'whom', 'Peterson', 'had', 'utmost', 'respect', 'Then', 'show', 'truly', 'begins.I', 'was', 'mesmerized', 'song', 'followed', 'distinct', 'contrasts', 'Brown', 'NHP', 'approach', 'playing', 'love', 'Brown', 'growling', 'bass', 'also', 'love', 'cleaner', 'notes', 'Pedersen', 'instrument', 'way', 'approached', 'music', 'folks', 'have', 'complained', 'camera', 'did', 'not', 'capture', 'minute', 'details', 'Oscar', 'hands', 'may', 'be', 'so', 'as', 'much', 'bassists', 'Oscar', 'bassists', 'treasure', 'counterbalance', 'complaints', 'camera', 'did', 'capture', 'Oscar', 'hands', 'frequent', 'shots', 'not', 'close', 'in.It', 'music', 'visual', 'feast', 'sound', 'wonderful', 'Granted', 'sound', 'quality', 'par', 'stillsufficiently', 'good', 'can', 'enjoy', 'video.If', 'single', 'lament', 'video', 'not', 'contain', 'last', 'song', 'performance', 'Soft', 'Winds', 'CD', 'cited', 'small', 'trade-off', 'CD', 'not', 'contain', 'first', 'three', 'songs', 'Oscar', 'performed', 'solo', 'being', 'joined', 'Brown', 'Pedersen', 'consider', 'fortunate', 'own', 'video', 'album', 'remarkable', 'work', 'fan', 'musician']",N/A

But hell's bells, for about the same price as any Ella cd you get well over an hour of one of the finest performers ever, and, frankly, an Ella in very good fettle.

Beware (but don't be put off) this is not a tradional trio. In fact it is Oscar with both Ray Brown and NHOP. After 3 solo Piano numbers the bass players generally alternate their playing, so most of the time it is really a duo. Towards the end of the DVD they play Sweet Georgia Brown and during this Neils and Ray look on in astonishment as Oscar goes into overdrive and burns the Piano up - its that good!I strongly recommend this disc together with all the other Norman Granz DVD's.
