This film is very fast-paced and loaded with action but Wild Cardz is very short.

From what I could make out, four women of the kingdoms card team protects the kingdom and in this case a giant chess peice. From there, it just seemed like a bunch of fast anime scenes and &quot;Here we go!&quot; kind of monolog with lots of naughty shots. I would either save your money or rent it but don't waste it buying this.",1,Don't waste your money!,1002499200,"10 8, 2001",2001,393,"['IMHO', 'was', 'worst', 'anime', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'awful', 'long', 'time', 'what', 'could', 'make', 'out', 'four', 'women', 'kingdoms', 'card', 'team', 'kingdom', 'case', 'giant', 'chess', 'peice', 'there', 'just', 'seemed', 'bunch', 'fast', 'anime', 'scenes', 'quot', 'Here', 'go', 'quot', 'kind', 'monolog', 'lots', 'naughty', 'shots', 'would', 'either', 'save', 'money', 'rent', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'buying']",Wild Cardz
472600,A2F6UZ8BMH45GX,6305668884,peter krug,"[1, 1]","In what I guess is a fantasy kingdom that looks quite a bit like one of our own contemporary cities, the land is protected by four super heroines whose powers are linked with the four different suites of cards. (One woman fights with spades, another with clubs, and so on.) However, the show focuses specifically on one, Jo Diamond. Perhaps if more episodes had been made, as it seems was meant to be the case, future enteries would have had the other three as the center point?Anyway, in the episode that we get to watch the girls must defeat a gigantic chess peice that is wrecking havoc in the city and is crewed by bad guys. Also Jo is reunited with a guy who seems to be an ex-lover. Unfortunately this is only hinted at and we aren't given much backround information as to their past histories. Some other drawbacks are the Chinese guy, who will be a turn-off for anyone who is offended by Chinese people being potrayed as buffonish steriotypes. (Kind of like Shampoo and the tour guide from Ranma 1/2. Do the Japanese think it's funny to poke fun at the Chinese?)Still and all, I liked this show. It's got cute characters, lots of comedy, action, and nice voice acting. (I have yet to hear the Japanese voices, but the English ones are quite good. Debbie Rabbai, who does the voice of Female Maze from MAZE, Ayane from AYANE'S HIGH KICK, and Rubette from GOKUDO, is our heroine Jo.) One last thing, though. The end is something of a cliffhanger, in that we don't know for certain if one of the superheroines survives or not.",4,"A lot of fun, but I would like to see more.",1071532800,"12 16, 2003",2003,1531,"['what', 'guess', 'fantasy', 'kingdom', 'quite', 'bit', 'one', 'own', 'contemporary', 'cities', 'land', 'protected', 'four', 'super', 'heroines', 'powers', 'are', 'linked', 'four', 'different', 'suites', 'cards', 'One', 'woman', 'fights', 'spades', 'clubs', 'so', 'However', 'show', 'specifically', 'one', 'Jo', 'Diamond', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'episodes', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'case', 'future', 'enteries', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'other', 'three', 'center', 'point', 'Anyway', 'episode', 'get', 'watch', 'girls', 'must', 'defeat', 'gigantic', 'chess', 'peice', 'wrecking', 'havoc', 'city', 'crewed', 'bad', 'guys', 'Also', 'Jo', 'reunited', 'guy', 'who', 'be', 'ex-lover', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'hinted', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'backround', 'information', 'past', 'histories', 'other', 'drawbacks', 'are', 'Chinese', 'guy', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'turn-off', 'anyone', 'who', 'offended', 'Chinese', 'people', 'being', 'potrayed', 'buffonish', 'steriotypes', 'Kind', 'Shampoo', 'tour', 'guide', 'Ranma', '1/2', 'Do', 'Japanese', 'think', 'funny', 'poke', 'fun', 'Chinese', 'Still', 'liked', 'show', 'got', 'cute', 'characters', 'lots', 'comedy', 'action', 'nice', 'voice', 'acting', 'have', 'yet', 'hear', 'Japanese', 'voices', 'English', 'ones', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'Debbie', 'Rabbai', 'who', 'voice', 'Female', 'Maze', 'MAZE', 'Ayane', 'AYANE', 'HIGH', 'KICK', 'Rubette', 'GOKUDO', 'heroine', 'Jo', 'One', 'last', 'thing', 'though', 'end', 'something', 'cliffhanger', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'certain', 'one', 'superheroines', 'survives', 'not']",Wild Cardz

472602,A1CJQPZGJB2DSJ,6305668884,"""solarnight""","[3, 4]","This is a crazy fast-paced anime originally titled Jaja Uma Quartette. The art is very crisp with its bright colors, and the soundtrack is pretty cool. Wild Cardz, is about four women: Coco Hearts, Jo Diamonds, Casa Clubs, and Sunday Spades, who are Crown Knights, protectors of the Card Kingdom. One day, a large white pawn begins to hover mindlessly through the Card Kingdom and destroys everything in its path. The Crown Knights are called to stop the pawn, even though nobody really knows how. Later on, the pawn upgrades to a knight, and black chess pieces begin to enter the fray. Also involved is a Chinese guy with a bad accent, and a semi-mysterious guy wearing blue. If you like obscure stuff like this, then you need this anime.",4,"Although short, a good ride.",992995200,"06 20, 2001",2001,739,"['crazy', 'fast-paced', 'anime', 'originally', 'titled', 'Jaja', 'Uma', 'Quartette', 'art', 'very', 'crisp', 'bright', 'colors', 'soundtrack', 'pretty', 'cool', 'Wild', 'Cardz', 'four', 'women', 'Coco', 'Hearts', 'Jo', 'Diamonds', 'Casa', 'Clubs', 'Sunday', 'Spades', 'who', 'are', 'Crown', 'Knights', 'protectors', 'Card', 'Kingdom', 'One', 'day', 'large', 'white', 'pawn', 'hover', 'mindlessly', 'Card', 'Kingdom', 'everything', 'path', 'Crown', 'Knights', 'are', 'called', 'stop', 'pawn', 'even', 'nobody', 'really', 'how', 'Later', 'pawn', 'knight', 'black', 'chess', 'pieces', 'begin', 'enter', 'fray', 'Also', 'involved', 'Chinese', 'guy', 'bad', 'accent', 'semi-mysterious', 'guy', 'wearing', 'blue', 'like', 'obscure', 'stuff', 'then', 'need', 'anime']",Wild Cardz
