1360672,A38M4BOJ8XXH1X,B003R4ZMRM,"Flippy ""Buchlieber""","[14, 15]","I rarely become involved in television series. But in some instances, there are some series that demand viewing if not for the entertainment but for the sheer quality of material.Rubicon is beyond compelling. It is fresh, real and moreover intelligent. There are no explosions, no car chases or scenes with gratuitous sex. It is a program to be savored slowly, something you dwell on think about in the time between episodes. The show evolves through character development, through reveals that heighten the tension and wonder. Instead of cliches and formulas, the viewer is faced with scripts built organically, the mystery unraveling.The series begins in New York following the life of Will Travers, an analysis working for A.P.I. (American Policy Institute). Like Robert Redford's character in Three Days of the Condor, he is employed to study the world around him, to predict the next big 'problem'. A.P.I. is a separate entity and though it may have some similarities with the F.B.I. or C.I.A. it operates independently.Will is our Everyman and when his Team Leader and father-n-law dies during a NYC train wreck, Will is left with clues and more questions as he becomes promoted to take on a leadership role.Ultimately, the show is focused on who is behind what and why. We see both sides but in no way is the audience completely clued in to what is going on. Like Will, we receive glimpses of the truth.Along the way, Rubicon also casts a light on American foreign policy, the use of torture, the deviousness of secret corporations and even addiction. The many characters that make up the show are equally three dimensional reminding us, the viewer that the very souls who are trying to save the world are just like us. There's Maggie, the single mother, secretary to Will's team; Grant, the structured analysis whose personality borders on OCD. Tanya is the youngest team member, the most vulnerable as her ideals and intelligence clash with the hard realities she witnesses while working with A.P.I. Miles, equally brilliant is equally lost in his own way, a nervous work-aholic at times immune to the sinister underworld of world governments.Of my favourite is Kale Ingram, former C.I.A. agent who acts as Will's supervisor both within A.P.I. and in other ways. The viewer is never quite sure where Kale's allegiance stands which makes Rubicon so fascinating. At one point in the season, he discusses Roman history and sheds light on the show's title and meaning. Even his facial features remind one of a Roman citizen depicted on an ancient coin.NOTE:Rubicon was recently canceled by AMC. My feeling is that perhaps the series was far too intelligent for its own good. Though the threat of violence haunts the characters in Rubicon, the effect is more psychological and subtle. Unfortunately, North American audiences enjoy dumb-t.v. like American Idol and Dancing with the Stars. Rubicon comes far too close to home and is meant for audiences that are uncomfortable with simple answers, answers fed to us. The majority of t.v. programs available on Direct TV, on Cable and other satellite providers is at best junk food compared to the edifying richness this show has to offer.If you fall in love with this show as I have write toAMC Viewer Services200 Jericho QuadrangleJericho, NY 11753Letters, not emails will get the attention of AMC.",5,Beyond compelling... not junk television,1304208000,"05 1, 2011",2011,3350,"['rarely', 'become', 'involved', 'television', 'series', 'instances', 'are', 'series', 'demand', 'viewing', 'not', 'entertainment', 'sheer', 'quality', 'material.Rubicon', 'compelling', 'fresh', 'real', 'moreover', 'intelligent', 'are', 'explosions', 'car', 'scenes', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'program', 'be', 'savored', 'slowly', 'something', 'dwell', 'think', 'time', 'episodes', 'show', 'character', 'development', 'reveals', 'heighten', 'tension', 'wonder', 'Instead', 'cliches', 'formulas', 'viewer', 'faced', 'scripts', 'built', 'organically', 'mystery', 'unraveling.The', 'series', 'New', 'York', 'following', 'life', 'Will', 'Travers', 'analysis', 'working', 'A.P.I', 'American', 'Policy', 'Institute', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'character', 'Three', 'Days', 'Condor', 'employed', 'study', 'world', 'predict', 'next', 'big', ""'problem"", 'A.P.I', 'separate', 'entity', 'may', 'have', 'similarities', 'F.B.I', 'C.I.A', 'independently.Will', 'Everyman', 'when', 'Team', 'Leader', 'father-n-law', 'dies', 'NYC', 'train', 'wreck', 'Will', 'left', 'clues', 'more', 'questions', 'promoted', 'take', 'leadership', 'role.Ultimately', 'show', 'focused', 'who', 'what', 'why', 'see', 'sides', 'way', 'audience', 'completely', 'clued', 'what', 'going', 'Will', 'receive', 'glimpses', 'truth.Along', 'way', 'Rubicon', 'also', 'light', 'American', 'foreign', 'policy', 'use', 'torture', 'deviousness', 'secret', 'corporations', 'even', 'addiction', 'many', 'characters', 'make', 'up', 'show', 'are', 'equally', 'three', 'dimensional', 'reminding', 'viewer', 'very', 'souls', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'save', 'world', 'are', 'just', 'Maggie', 'single', 'mother', 'secretary', 'Will', 'team', 'Grant', 'structured', 'analysis', 'personality', 'borders', 'OCD', 'Tanya', 'youngest', 'team', 'member', 'most', 'vulnerable', 'ideals', 'intelligence', 'clash', 'hard', 'realities', 'working', 'A.P.I', 'Miles', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'equally', 'lost', 'own', 'way', 'nervous', 'work-aholic', 'times', 'immune', 'sinister', 'underworld', 'world', 'governments.Of', 'favourite', 'Kale', 'Ingram', 'former', 'C.I.A', 'agent', 'who', 'as', 'Will', 'supervisor', 'A.P.I', 'other', 'ways', 'viewer', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'where', 'Kale', 'allegiance', 'Rubicon', 'fascinating', 'one', 'point', 'season', 'Roman', 'history', 'sheds', 'light', 'show', 'title', 'meaning', 'Even', 'facial', 'features', 'remind', 'one', 'Roman', 'citizen', 'depicted', 'ancient', 'coin.NOTE', 'Rubicon', 'was', 'recently', 'canceled', 'AMC', 'feeling', 'perhaps', 'series', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'intelligent', 'own', 'good', 'threat', 'violence', 'haunts', 'characters', 'Rubicon', 'effect', 'more', 'psychological', 'subtle', 'Unfortunately', 'North', 'American', 'audiences', 'enjoy', 'dumb-t.v', 'American', 'Idol', 'Dancing', 'Stars', 'Rubicon', 'far', 'too', 'close', 'home', 'meant', 'audiences', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'simple', 'answers', 'answers', 'fed', 'majority', 't.v', 'programs', 'available', 'Direct', 'TV', 'Cable', 'other', 'satellite', 'providers', 'best', 'junk', 'food', 'compared', 'edifying', 'richness', 'show', 'offer.If', 'fall', 'love', 'show', 'have', 'write', 'toAMC', 'Viewer', 'Services200', 'Jericho', 'QuadrangleJericho', 'NY', '11753Letters', 'not', 'emails', 'will', 'get', 'attention', 'AMC']",Rubicon
1360673,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003R4ZMRM,Grady Harp,"[16, 17]","A new show that is to be a series on AMC open this week, RUBICON by name, and if the first two episodes, back to back, are an indication of what is to come, this is definitely a thinking person's story.  By definition RUBICON means 'A limit that when passed or exceeded permits of no return and typically results in irrevocable commitment.'  The story in introduced in tidbits, pieces of a puzzle that seem to be at different poles with different characters in control.  A man commits suicide and leaves much of his estate and holdings to his wife  (Miranda Richardson) but he has been connected to a firm that investigates espionage-like situations.  As would be expected on an opening format, we barely get to know the characters who are bound to stay around: there is an investigative team whose leader is strangely killed in a train crash, leaving the top position open to a damaged man (James Badge Dale) whose wife and child were lost in 9/11 and his three associates - Dallas Roberts, Christopher Evan Welch, and Natalie Gold - each of whom has a bit of darkness to the character. And of course there are the elusive 'top people' (Arliss Howard et at), and naturally a 'mole' of dubious commitment to either side, whose purpose in the series is not explained as yet. There is a crunch to discover the identity of two men, puzzles to solve to piece together the plans that are in bizarre code, etc etc.  The writing for the script is good, the direction is fast paced and effective, the cast is an interesting crew of people,  the cinematography is appropriately gloomy, and the musical score manages to maintain tension.  It is worth staying with this series as the actors are all excellent and the hints of things to come are strong enough to make us want to see how they pan out.

Some of the best TV entertainments have been made after George Smiley's adventures.What has that got to do with Rubicon? This recent American spy series has surprisingly reached a comparable level of excellence. That, of course, needed to be punished, after all the market is the sovereign, and the ratings, it seems, were not high enough. The show has been stopped after one season. I have learned that from other reviews here. What a shame.The short-lived series (13 episodes) was about a NY based think tank involved in analyzing global developments of security relevance. The staff consisted of nerds and freaks, as think tanks do in real life. Chief of one of the teams, after his predecessor had died in a train crash, was a youngish depressed man whose wife and daughter had been at WTC on 9-11. He looks like Jens Lehmann (this comparison is only meaningful to football fans from Germany, Argentina, and London).The series was not about short cases, one per episode, but about a long case, which occupied the team for the whole season. My DVD cover has the nice sentence: Not every conspiracy is a theory! Good slow action with good micro situations embedded in a rather crazy macro plot.Well, maybe not all that crazy. The chief of the institute turns out (and we are given a whiff of that fairly early) to do good business with the reports and disasters that his staff and the world's terrorists produce. Something like insider trading. If you know what kind of disaster will happen, you can make money by being prepared. From predicting disasters to making them is a short logical step. Business is business.Which reminds me: I just saw a simple cartoon joke somewhere. Just one picture. Little boy tells an older man (grandpa?): I want to make a career in organized crime!

The payoff, towards the end of the season, is well worth it, so I'd definitely recommend this series.  It's not quite as engrossing as Breaking Bad - though personally I prefer it to the few episodes I've seen of Mad Men -  but it's still great television and is right now the one I look forward to the most each week.  I'm sad to see the end of season one - and can only hope it isn't the end of the series....The ""Rubicon"" of the title is never quite explained - though Kale Ingram (one of the most fascinating characters, in an entire cast that goes way beyond one-dimensional portrayals) alludes to it at some point.  Still, it suggests the pivotal moment when Ceasar violated the sacred Roman separation of civilian rule and military leadership.  The show asks, basically: what if some of these guys, who are not military but are incredibly intelligent civilians with very high security clearances, what if some of these people who really are the smartest ones in the room, got it in their heads to manipulate intelligence for their own private gain or for whatever other motives they might possess?  They could rule the world, behind the scenes.  The problem is that the questions they are addressing and the puzzles they are solving are ones that few are even equipped to follow.  That means that the only way they could really get caught if they decided to manipulate intelligence would be from someone within, one of their own civilian peers in the intelligence community.  Usually, they are too smart to leave any clues that such a one might follow.  This show follows what happens when they leave a trail.",4,"A slow building but intense conspiratorial thriller series - that asks about the intelligence behind ""the Intelligence""",1287360000,"10 18, 2010",2010,2523,"['Spy', 'thrillers', 'tend', 'be', 'smart', 'brawny', 'beautiful', 'agents', 'guns', 'kung', 'fu', 'moves', 'fast', 'cars', 'explosives', 'one', ""n't"", 'least', ""'re"", 'not', 'beautiful', 'brawny', 'are', 'quite', 'easy', 'eyes', 'mostly', 'pencil', 'pushers', 'who', 'work', 'scenes', 'make', 'tough', 'decision', 'based', 'timely', 'collection', 'evidence', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'together', 'then', 'get', 'fast', 'car', 'helicopter', 'apprehend', 'bad', 'guy', 'put', 'together', 'then', 'hear', 'consequences', 'news', 'have', 'live', 'questions', 'got', 'right.When', 'boss', 'mentor', 'dies', 'suspicious', 'circumstances', 'Will', 'Travers', 'caught', 'up', 'effort', 'solve', 'intricate', 'puzzle', 'where', 'soon', 'life', 'stake', 'stellar', 'performances', 'are', 'what', 'kept', 'going', 'few', 'middle', 'episodes', 'lagged', 'bit', 'terms', 'plot', 'payoff', 'end', 'season', 'well', 'worth', 'so', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'series', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'engrossing', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'personally', 'prefer', 'few', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Mad', 'Men', 'still', 'great', 'television', 'right', 'now', 'one', 'look', 'forward', 'most', 'week', ""'m"", 'sad', 'see', 'end', 'season', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope', ""n't"", 'end', 'series', 'Rubicon', 'title', 'never', 'quite', 'explained', 'Kale', 'Ingram', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'entire', 'cast', 'way', 'one-dimensional', 'portrayals', 'point', 'Still', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'when', 'Ceasar', 'violated', 'sacred', 'Roman', 'separation', 'civilian', 'rule', 'military', 'leadership', 'show', 'basically', 'what', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'military', 'are', 'incredibly', 'intelligent', 'civilians', 'very', 'high', 'security', 'clearances', 'what', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'smartest', 'ones', 'room', 'got', 'heads', 'manipulate', 'intelligence', 'own', 'private', 'gain', 'other', 'motives', 'might', 'possess', 'could', 'rule', 'world', 'scenes', 'problem', 'questions', 'are', 'addressing', 'puzzles', 'are', 'solving', 'are', 'ones', 'few', 'are', 'even', 'equipped', 'follow', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'really', 'get', 'caught', 'decided', 'manipulate', 'intelligence', 'would', 'be', 'someone', 'one', 'own', 'civilian', 'peers', 'intelligence', 'community', 'Usually', 'are', 'too', 'smart', 'leave', 'clues', 'one', 'might', 'follow', 'show', 'what', 'when', 'leave', 'trail']",Rubicon
