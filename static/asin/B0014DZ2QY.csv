It ran for the better part of two seasons before being yanked, only to offer a sense of closure in a final episode the following year.  Brand and Falsey deserve the lion's share of credit for this excellent series that brought the civil rights era to life for another generation to see, but David Chase had a directoral hand in at least two episodes.The parallels between Sam Waterston's D.A. Forrest Bedford and Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch are obvious, but the heart and soul of the show was Regina Baker as Lily Harper.  The casting was superb from the wonderful kids that Lily found herself raising, in addition to her own wonderful daughter, to Kathryn Harrold as Christina.Like all of Brand and Falsey's television series, I'll Fly Away captured a time and place and made it come alive.  They dealt with so many thorny issues but never came across as pedantic, with a strong focus on family and how Forrest's role as a DA affected them,  You got a very good impression of what it was like to grow up in the rural South during the late 50s.  Telling the story through Lily was a masterstroke, erasing the paternalistic attitude so many shows dealing with that era take and giving you a deeper insight into the black community when the episodes focused on her personal family, including her father, played with understated elegance by Bill Cobbs.I hope we will see it very soon on DVD.",5,Long overdue,1222560000,"09 28, 2008",2008,1554,"['would', 'think', 'Chase', 'success', 'Sopranos', 'full', 'set', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'DVD', 'would', 'finally', 'release', ""'ll"", 'Fly', 'Away', 'complete', 'set', 'ran', 'better', 'part', 'two', 'seasons', 'being', 'yanked', 'only', 'offer', 'sense', 'closure', 'final', 'episode', 'following', 'year', 'Brand', 'Falsey', 'deserve', 'lion', 'share', 'credit', 'excellent', 'series', 'brought', 'civil', 'rights', 'era', 'life', 'generation', 'see', 'David', 'Chase', 'had', 'directoral', 'hand', 'least', 'two', 'episodes.The', 'parallels', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'D.A', 'Forrest', 'Bedford', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'are', 'obvious', 'heart', 'soul', 'show', 'was', 'Regina', 'Baker', 'Lily', 'Harper', 'casting', 'was', 'superb', 'wonderful', 'kids', 'Lily', 'found', 'raising', 'addition', 'own', 'wonderful', 'daughter', 'Kathryn', 'Harrold', 'Christina.Like', 'Brand', 'Falsey', 'television', 'series', ""'ll"", 'Fly', 'Away', 'captured', 'time', 'place', 'made', 'come', 'alive', 'dealt', 'so', 'many', 'thorny', 'issues', 'never', 'came', 'pedantic', 'strong', 'focus', 'family', 'how', 'Forrest', 'role', 'DA', 'affected', 'got', 'very', 'good', 'impression', 'what', 'was', 'grow', 'up', 'rural', 'South', 'late', '50s', 'Telling', 'story', 'Lily', 'was', 'masterstroke', 'erasing', 'paternalistic', 'attitude', 'so', 'many', 'shows', 'dealing', 'era', 'take', 'giving', 'deeper', 'insight', 'black', 'community', 'when', 'episodes', 'focused', 'personal', 'family', 'including', 'father', 'played', 'understated', 'elegance', 'Bill', 'Cobbs.I', 'hope', 'will', 'see', 'very', 'soon', 'DVD']",N/A

We finished watchin' the last episode, Then & Now, tonight. Wow! By far, one of THE best series ever produced and shown on TV. All the tapes played well, luckily. Most of the episodes were taped in EP mode. Video shows very well and the audio sounds fine...for videotape that's a couple decades old. Missing one episode, though, according to the episode listing. This series has always been one of our favorites. We wished they would make available a complete DVD boxed set w/the Behind-The-Scenes mini-documentaries that were shown along with the PBS airings. Regina Taylor(Lilly) and Sam Waterston(Forrest) gave brilliant performances. Jeremy/Jason London(Nathan), Ashlee Levitch(Francie) and John Aaron Bennett(John Morgan) acted as brothers and sister would. And Lilly's father and daughter, Bill Cobbs(Lewis) and Rae'ven Kelly(Adlaine) were outstanding. Brad Sullivan's performance as the Warriors wresting coach is pure genius. All gave their best and it shows in each episode. It was nice spending the last few weeks with the Harpers and the Bedfords.I'll Fly Away tells many stories. The Civil Rights Movement is the key story, though. And this series shows it. It doesn't hold back any punches. A rare gem.Please release the I'll Fly Away TV series on DVD.

When ""I'll Fly Away"" premiered on TV, I watched and was fascinated. It was one of the best human dramas I'd ever seen. Updated to the 60's, there is no element of ""Mockingbird"" that isn't prevalent...the racism, the lawyer, the kids and the love...and the hate. The human condition is well examined. Sam Waterston and Regina King both won awards for their powerhouse performances in the short-lived series. The TV audiences just weren't there, and, despite great reviews and lots of awards, the series, pitiably, was cancelled.
