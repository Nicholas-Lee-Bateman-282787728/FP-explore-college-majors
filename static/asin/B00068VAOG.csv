863919,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00068VAOG,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[80, 150]","This is a low budget documentary that succinctly lays to rest some of the incredible distortions put forth by propagandist Michael Moore, who actually thinks ""there is no terrorist threat"". As Ron Silver, one of the participants in this film explains, this mindset is a re-run of 1937-38 Europe and their attitude towards the Nazi threat. Those who do not know or acknowledge history, are condemned to repeat it.It takes the myths in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and dispels them with logic, starting with the ""My Pet Goat"" incident. Others include the ""Saudi Connection"", the ""Oregon Coast"" nonsense, the ""Carlyle Group"", whose biggest link is actually George Soros, and the ""Patriot Act"".The saddest is Moore's twisted interpretation of Sgt. Peter Damon's words, used without his consent and out of context, as well as his sick exploitation of a family's grief after losing a son in Iraq. The depths Moore will sink to fabricate his ""documentaries"" for fame and fortune is appalling.Directed by Alan Peterson, this film interviews Sen. Zell Miller, who I admire and respect for his courage and principles, as well as Dick Morris, Ed Koch, Congressman Peter King, ""American Jihad"" author Steven Emerson, and people who appeared in Moore's film, who want to set the record straight.I find it sad that there is a segment of the population who swallow Moore's rotting garbage as if it were a gourmet meal. Rather like Leni Riefenstahl , Hitler's propagandist (though Moore is far from being in the same league as Riefenstahl as a filmmaker), Moore starts out with a premise, and splices his film to fit the premise, creating celluloid lies for the gullible, or those that share his twisted view of America.Michael Moore has said ""Americans are possibly the dumbest people on the planet"". Perhaps he is referring to his fans, who have made him very rich while he deceives them. Please don't be one of his sheeple...read some history...see this documentary...wake up to the truth.",4,dispelling the Mooreonic myths,1101513600,"11 27, 2004",2004,1965,"['low', 'budget', 'documentary', 'succinctly', 'rest', 'incredible', 'distortions', 'put', 'forth', 'propagandist', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'who', 'actually', 'terrorist', 'threat', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'one', 'participants', 'film', 'mindset', 're-run', '1937-38', 'Europe', 'attitude', 'Nazi', 'threat', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'acknowledge', 'history', 'are', 'condemned', 'repeat', 'it.It', 'myths', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'dispels', 'logic', 'starting', 'My', 'Pet', 'Goat', 'incident', 'Others', 'include', 'Saudi', 'Connection', 'Oregon', 'Coast', 'nonsense', 'Carlyle', 'Group', 'biggest', 'link', 'actually', 'George', 'Soros', 'Patriot', 'Act', '.The', 'saddest', 'Moore', 'twisted', 'interpretation', 'Sgt', 'Peter', 'Damon', 'words', 'used', 'consent', 'context', 'as', 'well', 'sick', 'exploitation', 'family', 'grief', 'losing', 'son', 'Iraq', 'depths', 'Moore', 'will', 'sink', 'fabricate', 'documentaries', 'fame', 'fortune', 'appalling.Directed', 'Alan', 'Peterson', 'film', 'Sen.', 'Zell', 'Miller', 'who', 'admire', 'respect', 'courage', 'principles', 'as', 'well', 'Dick', 'Morris', 'Ed', 'Koch', 'Congressman', 'Peter', 'King', 'American', 'Jihad', 'author', 'Steven', 'Emerson', 'people', 'who', 'appeared', 'Moore', 'film', 'who', 'want', 'set', 'record', 'straight.I', 'find', 'segment', 'population', 'who', 'swallow', 'Moore', 'rotting', 'garbage', 'were', 'gourmet', 'meal', 'Leni', 'Riefenstahl', 'Hitler', 'propagandist', 'Moore', 'far', 'being', 'same', 'league', 'as', 'Riefenstahl', 'filmmaker', 'Moore', 'out', 'premise', 'film', 'fit', 'premise', 'creating', 'celluloid', 'gullible', 'share', 'twisted', 'view', 'America.Michael', 'Moore', 'said', 'Americans', 'are', 'possibly', 'dumbest', 'people', 'planet', 'Perhaps', 'referring', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'very', 'rich', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'one', 'sheeple', 'read', 'history', 'see', 'documentary', 'wake', 'up', 'truth']",N/A
863920,A34PAZQ73SL163,B00068VAOG,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[55, 92]","This film was created to go after and take down the maniacal Michael Moore, and I'm pleased to report that it succeeds wonderfully. The debunking is thorough and total. There is little left of Michael Moore except a grotesque, grizzled carcass by the time FahrenHYPE 9/11 ends.The film is composed of a considerable amount of interviews with well-known public figures, but some of the interview subjects are rare and valuable. The teacher whose classroom George W. Bush attended during the morning of 9/11 is heard from and it's quite a journalistic ""get"". She comments that, although she did not vote for him, she regarded him as acting appropriately and Presidential on that day. This is just one of the many ways in which the film refutes Moore's assertions in Fahrenheit 911. Ed Koch is an exceptional commentator and points out that, although he voted for Gore in 2000, Bush's leadership has won him over in the years since. Zell Miller and Dick Morris lend further gravitas to the production and Ron Silver is excellent as well.The response to Moore is detailed and large in scale. We find that his statistic about Bush's vacation time before 9/11 was inaccurate, and that his footage of Bush at the 2000 Al Smith dinner was misleading due to its leaving out Al Gore's attendance, and that Fahrenheit 9/11's link of Bush to the Carlyle Group and Bin Laden is entirely fictional. In fact, the Carlyle Group is more closely affiliated to George ""Moveon.org"" Soros than to George Herbert Walker Bush. Particularly surprising was the interview with the poor Oregon State trooper who Moore manipulated via inclusion in his film. It seems that the trooper never met Moore at all but thought he was doing a local documentary. A great point, consistently presented by the interviewees is that Islamofascism is the biggest threat to US security today.I could not agree more even though Fahrenheit 9/11 slanderously claimed that it is not a threat to America at all.

If there were bombs placed in the building the steel beams  would have given us the evidence we needed for persons responsible for this.  I have seen some of the fire fighters say it was like on every floor bombs going off one right after the other.  the president used the excuse that the folks in NYC needed to get rid of the mess for it hurt them to look at it.

However, attempting to market this as a bipartisan response to Fahrenheit 9/11 only serves to damage this film's credibility even further, as one glance at the cast listing will tell you:- Ron Silver (the narrator), a liberal-turned-conservative actor- Dick Morris...while the pacakging touts him as a consultant to both Trent Lott and Bill Clinton, no mention is made of how he's since become an outspoken critic of the latter's wife, even joining the on-air staff of Fox News ('nuff said!)- Ann ""I hate liberals"" Coulter...do you expect Democrats and the political left to get a fair shake from any work that includes her as a participant?- Sen. Zell Miller, a glorified DINO (Democrat In Name Only)...even the packaging mentions his voting for Bush in 04 and being a keynote speaker at the same year's RNC- Former NYC mayor Ed Koch, a conservative Dem...but regardless of his views, Peterson should've though twice about using him regardless, given the apparent senility he projects in his on-screen timeAnd what did the disabled solider from Farenheit expect when he gave that interview, regardless of its context? Moore was still free to use it as he pleased.Anyway, if you're looking for a politically one-sided response to Moore, don't let me stop you.

Am I so opinionated that I concern myself with Michael Moore's propoganda when the 2004 election has long been decided and the DVDs, pro and con are irrelevant to the electoral process? Do I have a perverse need to write reviews on controversial films and books which make me a magnet for negative votes? (sigh) Yes, I guess I am a partisan jerk who just has to weigh in on everything, so, for what it is worth (and I suspect that is very little) here's my review:This DVD gives the story behind Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11. For example, Moore accuses President Bush of acting inappropriately as he found out about the terrorist attacks while visiting an elementay school. However, this DVD features the principal of that school, who did not vote for Bush in 2000, but who had only high praise for the Presidents reaction to the attacks. Other Democrats who did not vote for Bush also praise the President and point out the deceptions of Moore's film These include former mayor Ed Koch, Zel Miller, and actor Ron Silver.Moore deceived many of his subjects in filmimg Fahrenheit 9/11. For example, the soldier who lost his arms states that he was not against Bush and the War in Iraq. He states that any effort by Moore to portray him as so was deceptive. An Oregon state trooper who had been included in Moore's film states that any complaints about funding was at the state level and in no way was he implying that the federal government was failing to fund the war on terror.Particularly deceptive was showing a clip of Bush at the 2000 Al Smith dinner held annually in New York. He was shown referring to wealthy corporate types as his ""base."" What Moore didn't show was that Al Gore was also at the dinner and that a feature of this dinner is that politicians engage in self deprecatory humor. Fahrenhype clears this decption up.This DVD was a project of Dick Morris, who served as an advisor to Bill Clinton.

Moffatt ""DaveMmn""","[4, 7]","Nearly three years after the 2004 election, which this film preceded, the half-truths, untruths, and innuendos which permeate it are extraordinarily obvious.  Rather than presenting a rebuttal to Michael Moore's film ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", 99% of this effort is devoted to attacking Michael Moore--while blaming anything bad that has happened in the world of late on Bill Clinton.In its defense, this film DOES reveal and explain one significant inaccuracy in Michael Moore's film.  This seems almost accidental as the various participants proceed to ask questions about ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", then provide responses to an almost unrelated matter (often one on which Moore was silent).  Many arguments are left unsupported by sources or substantiating facts (Moore, whatever one may think of him, did generally ""show his work"").  Moore is compared variously to Leni Riefenstahl and Tokyo Rose, and when all else fails, Ann Coulter pops in to say something angry which, more often than not, is utterly irrelevant.  Among the sources cited for ""facts"" presented here is The Washington Times, owned by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon and as one might guess, hardly noted for objectivity.Claims that the Veteran's Administration is providing excellent care to wounded servicepeople seem almost ridiculous in light of the recent Walter Reed scandal.  Claims by various service families and relatives that they were somehow ""exploited"" by Moore sound more like sour grapes than legitimate complaints (were they filmed without permission?  If so, where are the lawsuits?). And so on and so on and so on.This film, along with Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", would be most entertaining viewing just prior to the next presidential election.  This example in particular illustrates beautifully how ""factoids"" can be manupulated into ""the truth"".

863935,A2BTYX4QNN3S20,B00068VAOG,JR Dunn,"[27, 46]","A solid, intelligent rebuttal of Michael Moore's wildly successful polemic prepared and released in time to make a difference. The film was produced by a group helmed by the veteran political operative Dick Morris, one of the slippier characters on the current political scene, but that should affect judgment of the content not at all.Flaws include an overreliance on right-of-center talking heads, a few of whom come across as strange, others as droners. Exceptions include Frank Gaffney, a man who knows whereof he speaks, Ann Coulter, who fires one broadside after another with all the bounciness of a twelve-year-old (no wonder they hate her so much), and ironically, Dick Morris himself, who evidently had his sincerity button pressed long and hard on 9/11. Ron Silver, the veteran character actor who has caused some dismay in the industry over the past year by acting like a man with a brain, provides a welcome dash of professionalism.But the meat is contained in interviews with private figures misappropriated or otherwise abused by the people's tribune. These include the Florida teacher whose classroom Bush was visiting at the time of the attack, with a very eye-opening tale of media manipulation to tell, and the relatives of a dead soldier whose funeral footage was commandeered by Moore, excoriating both hismethods and message.Above all, there's the kid whose hands were blown off in the Blackhawk chopper maintenance accident, who got to star in Moore's film with neither his knowledge or permission. This footage is both astonishing and deeply moving. Here's a guy who at a young age has suffered more than most people will in a lifetime, who feels neither regrets nor bitterness, and would do it all again if that was required. Nothing places Moore's cynicism in clearer perspective than this, the spirit of cheerful sacrifice, supposedly alien to our epoch.A number of technical problems exist. The first two rental disks refused to play, leading to dark muttering of left-wing sabotage from friends. The final disk contained several flaws, such as thescreen suddenly turning black and white in the middle of interviews.But though FahrenHYPE 9/11 is not as well made as Moore's opus, has no extras, and will be seen by only a fraction of Moore's audience, the old saw about substance versus flash remains true.

863936,A1XZA0HJ10Z0VL,B00068VAOG,Kameelyun,"[29, 46]","OK.  The debunker is about to be debunked.First, I'll mention what I believe are legitimate criticisms of Michael Moore's movie.  Though I generally agree with Moore and his message, there are occasions where he stretches a bit.  One of the most valid points made concerns the Oregon coast.  In Fahrenheit, Moore points to the one part-time trooper within 100 miles of coast, and makes it appear this man, singularily, is responsible for keeping boats of terrorists at bay.  State tax dollars do not go to border patrol; this is something that federal agencies specialize in; federal police and the Coast Guard.Personally though, I think Moore included that scene, more than anything, as an excuse to give us yet another slice of small town rural Americana, like he does with Tappahannock VA, or in ""Roger & Me"" when he includes the totally extraneous scene of a woman building up an Amway buisness.  In this instance he couldn't resist the temptation to make a direct link between the lack of troopers and Bush's incompetence.Another valid point, illustrated via FahrenHYPE's contributors, is that the US - Saudi relationship is a delicate, flawed relationship which stems all the way back to 1945, and that one can find ample pictures of every American president hamming it up with the Saudi elite.  This does illustrate one tenet of Moore's movie: it focuses so singularily on Bush's administration that the less-educated viewer might think ""Crap.  Our government had so much openness and integrity before the criminal regime of Bush Inc.""  In reality, Bush's policies, though more aggressive and transparent than his predecessors, are the culmination of fifty years of US imperialism.  This might take a slight amount of heat off Bush personally, but it doesn't excuse our government's imperialism.(It is worthy to note, however, that in ""Bowling for Columbine,"" Moore does highlight the larger context of US foreign policy from 1945-present.)OK, now to rebut the more ridiculous criticisms:First, there's the ""mountain-out-of-molehill"" school of criticism of Moore's movie:That in the Florida classroom, the children were reading to the president, not the other way round!  Second, the amount of time Bush was sitting there was actually five minutes, not seven!  Third, Porter Goss' phone number was not a 1800 number, but a 1-877 toll free number!Needless to say, the above criticisms do not stand up affirmatively to the question ""Does this alter the validity of the message of Moore's film?""Election 2000:  Shot of Katherine Harris declaring that Bush won.  Remember, Katherine Harris was the secretary of state, which also meant she was the Florida vote-counter for Bush.  FahrenHYPE completely avoids the Black voter disenfranchisement issue.  It does however focus on a shot of an editorial Moore used, from Bloomington Illinois' PANTAGRAPH paper.  Apparently, Moore blew up the headline and rearranged the paragraphs so that they would fit the movie screenshot.  The paper was offended and asked Moore for an apology, which he rightfully did not issue, as he did nothing wrong.After 10 minutes of the FahrenHYPE's contributors reminiscing about the patriotism and heroism of the police and firefighters on 9/11, obviously included to put the viewer back into the immediate 9/11 aftermath mindset, political operative Dick Morris starts attacking Clinton for eight years of failure to stop 9/11.  No hard facts are presented that Clinton was asleep at the wheel; to the contrary, Clinton's team thwarted many domestic al-Qaeda attacks, most notably a Y2K (late 1999) plot to blow up Los Angeles international airport.  Why?  Because they took warnings seriously.  Clinton met with Richard Clarke for terrorism briefings every day.  Bush had a clear warning on August 6, 2001 and ignored it.  Of course, none of this is mentioned in FahrenHYPE.Moving on to Afghanistan and the whole Unocal thing:  what Dick Morris and company are saying IS TRUE:  Unocal DID explore an Afghan pipeline deal during the Clinton period (when Dubya was governor) and the plan WAS dropped.  But they don't tell you the rest of it, because it proves Moore's point.  The REASON it was dropped was because Unocal couldn't negotiate with the Taliban.  Once the Taliban was out of power after 9/11, plans for the pipline could resume.Well, this review is getting long, but to just rebut one more criticism in HYPE: Moore's ""emotional manipulation"" of his audience.  While it is true that Moore is a master of this, Fahrenheit justifies its use.  In HYPE, Hardy and Clarke (""Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man"") use the exact example I knew they would:  Moore's footage of Iraqi children playing, followed by the US bombing of Baghdad.  Clarke says, ""Moore shows you children flying kites, then immediately cuts to the bombing, and the viewer associates the bomb damage with the children.  In actuality the bombs were directed at Saddam's military targets and bunker.""This would be valid criticism were it not for two things:  First, there have, to date, been over 100,000 Iraqi civilian deaths.  Second, Moore immediately follows the bombing footage with footage of a pickup truck full of dead bodies, including at least one child!  Hardy/Clarke's point here is null and void, and clearly directed toward partisans who refuse to see Mr. Moore's movie.Oh, and the amputee who's outraged over being included in Fahrenheit and disagrees with Moore's take on the war:  he's in denial.  He's lost his leg and can't accept the fact that the reason he went to war could be a lie.  In a few years, when the ugly truth hits him, he'll be bitter.Finally, toward the end, the right-wing hate reaches its artful conclusion:  ""Michael Moore is un-American; he's not British... he must be French!""",2,"Kernels of valid criticism, amidst much Right-Wing Hate",1114905600,"05 1, 2005",2005,5776,"['OK', 'debunker', 'be', 'debunked.First', ""'ll"", 'mention', 'what', 'believe', 'are',

I think that this film was more of a pure documentary than Moore's film, which I consider to be propaganda.  However I do think that the film failed to do one important thing: explain to the viewer how Moore's film was full of fabrications and crafty editing.Yes, all the major lies and manipulations were pointed out.  But, unless you had just finished watching Moore's film, it can be hard to remember everything being referred to from ""Farenheit"".  I imagine that Michael Moore fans and most people on the Left will not be affected by this film, which I consider to be a major failure on the part of the film maker.  Michael Moore is hardly in the film and scenes from ""Farenheit 9/11"" are very scarse.  It would be more effective if scenes were shown - immediately followed by a presentation of the actual facts.  Much of the time, people being interviewed just talked about it.  Visuals would have been much more effective.I recommend this documentary to anyone who loves Michael Moore and hates president Bush.  This film will, at the very least, offer a new way of looking at Michael Moore and provide an opportunity to see him as the manipulator of facts that he actually is.  The film is also a useful tool for those that speak out against Moore and can offer you the ammunition you need to win a debate against someone who sticks up for ""Farenheit 9/11"".",4,Important documentary - though sometimes boring,1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,1707,"['would', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'believe', 'important', 'have', 'strong', 'rebuttal', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'Farenheit', '9/11', 'give', '4.The', 'film', 'good', 'interviews', 'strong', 'statements', 'Left', 'Right', 'most', 'importantly', 'interviews', 'people', 'were', 'featured', 'Farenheit', 'who', 'disagree', 'completely', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'pure', 'documentary', 'Moore', 'film', 'consider', 'be', 'propaganda', 'However', 'do', 'think', 'film', 'failed', 'do', 'one', 'important', 'thing', 'explain', 'viewer', 'how', 'Moore', 'film', 'was', 'full', 'fabrications', 'crafty', 'editing.Yes', 'major', 'lies', 'manipulations', 'were', 'pointed', 'out', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Moore', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'remember', 'everything', 'being', 'referred', 'Farenheit', 'imagine', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'fans', 'most', 'people', 'Left', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'affected', 'film', 'consider', 'be', 'major', 'failure', 'part', 'film', 'maker', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'hardly', 'film', 'scenes', 'Farenheit', '9/11', 'are', 'very', 'scarse', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'effective', 'scenes', 'were', 'shown', 'immediately', 'followed', 'presentation', 'actual', 'facts', 'Much', 'time', 'people', 'being', 'interviewed', 'just', 'talked', 'Visuals', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'effective.I', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'anyone', 'who', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'hates', 'president', 'Bush', 'film', 'will', 'very', 'least', 'offer', 'new', 'way', 'looking', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'provide', 'opportunity', 'see', 'manipulator', 'facts', 'actually', 'film', 'also', 'useful', 'tool', 'speak', 'out', 'Moore', 'can', 'offer', 'ammunition', 'need', 'win', 'debate', 'someone', 'who', 'up', 'Farenheit', '9/11']",N/A

He rented it because he wanted to ""know thy enemy"" and it was in that spirit that I watched it as well.There really isn't much here on the whole. I'll be polite and say that the Fox News Contributors and absolutely loony Zell Miller did little to sway me. But then they finally bring out the one big gun they possess: the ""phantom limb pain guy.""  They prove to my satisfaction that Michael Moore did a nauseatingly dishonest thing. There is something especially despicable about using a man who has sacrificed his limbs for his country in an anti-war film without his consent, a film that is apparently totally contrary to his own beliefs. Now, if memory serves, that clip was used as part of Moore's contention that the US military was not doing enough to help those with medical problems. I'm sure he could have found someone who would willingly attest to that fact, but no that person might not have missing limbs, and if film history has taught audiences one thing about the disability experience it is that nothin' says ""war is terrible"" like a severely disabled vet.I would consider what Michael Moore did to be not only exploitive, but also to be akin to perjury, it casts doubt on everything else in the film.If the man told the makers of ""Fahrenhype"" the exact opposite of what Moore implied, it is safe to assume that Michael Moore must have had some inkling from the source footage that he harbored no ill feelings toward the military.I used to be what Michael Moore calls a RINO- a Republican In Name Only. He convinced me that corporations get away with crimes the media will not cover, that healthcare should be universal, that most of us will never be rich so we should have no false allegiances to the wealthy in the hopes of someday joining them, and lastly despite his ill-timed and ultimately very disrespectful Oscar-speech, he helped me realize beyond all doubt that this war is unjust.

Buentello,"[52, 99]","I tired to see this movie to get ""the other side of the coin"" from a totally biased movie, which was Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911, and of course, he is trying to make a point. First of all, this has a very right-winged feeling. They are portraying a president that I really don't know why they don't add a halo in it already. Second, the so-called ""experts"" just blunt explanations like when people don't want to admit guilt and just say whatever to defend themselves. One example was Michael Moore's allegation of Bush's connection with the BinLaden family. Well, these guys counterattacked by saying ""well, then you have a bigger problem because so and so from the Clinton cabinet belongs to that group too."" does this mean Moore is lying? I don't think so. Yet, for some reason, this movie is too concerned in calling Moore a liar without much basis.  They never gave an intelligent explanation on the Bin Laden connection and why Osama Bin Laden is still at large if he was and *IS* the real threat considering 911.The only honesty I seemed to grasp from the movie was from the soldiers, their families, and the actor that assimilated the atrocities of Sadam Hussein (if we don't stop him in time, what would it lead to?) with those of Adolf Hitler. I can see their point of view and can sympathize. From the people Moore interviewed, I can see the point this movie makes about the Oregon state trooper. It's true; lack of funding is really the state's problem, not federal. The other soldier that felt ""violated"" though, he even mentioned that the footage was from another interview, well then, who isn't going to use public footage for their use? I really feel bad for him, and I guess when something like that happens to the soldiers or there is a loss of a loved one in war, we are going to blame someone, some people blame the elite people making the decisions of going to war and their reasons, others will blame the people who are protesting against these people and their reasons like Michael Moore. That is sadly the way it is. However, I didn't feel Moore mocked the soldiers; he just presented footage, some of it was raw and unpleasing, some of it was honoring and presenting the feelings of the soldiers. And the footage from the soldiers, I thought, they are human, they believe they are going to fight the enemy ""evil"" otherwise they wouldn't be there. Also, if Moore is a lying bstrd, then why not add an interview of the most compelling lady from the movie, the one that was very patriotic and then lost her son? Is this a fake too? It didn't seem to me.Questions that make one wonder.... what happened to the orange level threat during the elections? Instead of spending so much for his election, shouldn't Bush have focused on something else, like, Osama Bin Laden or the problem in Iraq with increasing numbers of soldiers (more than 1000) dying not to mention about 100,000 Iraquis dead? And if Iraq was a very real threat, wasn't it too North Korea? Heck they really have not disarmed. Or better yet, why not bomb half the globe! Who isn't a threat nowadays? Or maybe, that is exactly what our good president and his administration are thinking of already....(history to be continued). Oh, and don't expect to hear any of these questions explored by this lame documentary.I would have applauded this movie if they would have shown the unbiased truth on Moore, and on Bush (good, bad and ugly on both), but no success. And even though Moore is totally biased on his attacks for Bush (please note, Bush, NOT THE MILITARY as they say in this movie) I enjoyed Moore's film much better than this one.

Fahrenhype does not address that salient fact - that our congress is so inept that legislation gets passed the day after it comes off the press without so much as a glance. Or as Homer Simpson once said, ""Wait a minute, I don't sign anything until someone gives me the gist of it.""Moore pointed out that only one member of congress has their son in the military in Iraq - no rebuttal - lame, lame, lame. Also no rebuttal to the salient fact that the poor are in the military in much greater numbers than the rich.I wish the makers of this piece of dreck would sign up at their local recruiter and take Hannity and Limbaugh with them - and for you Limbaugh fans, did you know that Mr. Big Mouth attends Bilderberg meetings with the blessing of his friend and confidant David Rockefeller? Means nothing? Look up Bilderberg and then get back to me. Rush and Hannity and all the other loud mouth flag waving chicken hawks are Judas goats financed by the global elite to urge you to send your son or daughter off to fight for oil. Oh, by the way, the fact that the acting Presdent of Afghanistan was an adviser to UNOCAL gets no rebuttal in this movie either.Moore pointed out that Bush continued to sit staring into space at the mention of the 9/11 attacks - Fahrenhype actually defends this, saying his aides were telling him to sit still. Who the hell is running this country anyway? Even Ann Coulter defends this stupidity - ""What was he supposed to do? Run out the door and shout Let me take the first bullet!"" Well, Ms. Coulter, no.

It doesn't matter whether they are liberal or conservative, they can all equally be biased. Liberal documenaries tend to be more biased. Conservative documenaries are not as biased because they use a lot of facts to back up their points.I've debated many supporters of Michael Moore on the IMDb. Their arguement against people such as Michael Wilson, and Dick Morris is that Moore is just merely questioning the Bush administration and its policies. Moore is not just questioning the Bush administration. He wants to prove that President Bush is the worst president in our nation's history. Bush is not a perfect president, but he's not the criminal that Michael Moore portrays him as. But Moore wants Bush out of office. Political protest against the government for doing something wrong, is not unpatriotic, but using bent facts to slander or defame the government is. This is exactly what Michael Moore has done in Fahrenheit 9/11. I have exposed nine lies in Fahrenheit 9/11.They include...Fahrenheit Lie #1: National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice is depicted in the movie telling a reporter, ""Oh, indeed there is a tie between Iraq and what happened on 9/11.""The scene deceptively shows the Administration directly blaming Saddam and his regime for the attacks on 9/11 by taking her comments out of context. Now read the entire statement made by Ms. Rice to the reporter: ""Oh, indeed there is a tie between Iraq and what happened on 9/11. It's not that Saddam Hussein was somehow himself and his regime involved in 9/11. But if you think about what caused 9/11, it is the rise of ideologies of hatred that led people to drive airplanes into buildings in New York.""Fahrenheit Lie #2: In the film, Moore leads viewers to believe that members of bin Laden's family were allowed to exit the country after the attacks without questioning by authorities.The September 11th commission, on the other hand, reported that 22 of the 26 people on the flight that took most of the bin Laden family out of the country were interviewed and found to be innocent of suspicion. The commission reported that ""each of the flights we have studied was investigated by the FBI and dealt with in a professional manner prior to its departure.""Fahrenheit Lie #3: Moore claims that James Bath, a friend of President Bush from his time with the Texas Air National Guard, might have funneled bin Laden money to an unsuccessful Bush oil-drilling firm called Arbusto Energy.Bill Allison, managing editor for the Center for Public Integrity (an independent watchdog group in Washington, D.C.), on the other hand, said, ""We looked into bin Laden money going to Arbusto, and we never found anything to back that up,"" (Source: Seattle Times, 7/5/04).Fahrenheit Lie #4: The movie claims that the Bush administration ""supported closing veterans hospitals.""""The Department of Veterans Affairs did propose closing seven hospitals in areas with declining populations where the hospitals were underutilized, and whose veterans could be served by other hospitals"" (Source: Kopel, Independence Institute). But Moore's film fails to mention that the Department also proposed building new hospitals in areas where needs were growing, and also proposed building blind rehabilitation centers and spinal cord injury centers (Source: Department of Veterans Affairs).Fahrenheit #5: Conspiracy theories abound about the reasons for the War on Terror, but none is more outlandish than the one propagandized in Moore's film: that the Afghan war was fought solely to enable the Unocal company to build an oil pipeline (the plan for which was abandoned by the company in 1998).Moore ""suggests that one of the first official acts of Afghan President Hamid Karzai ... was to help seal a deal for ... Unocal to build an oil pipeline from the Caspian Sea through Afghanistan to the Indian Ocean. It alleges that Karzai had been a Unocal consultant,"" (emphasis added), (Source: Seattle Times, 7/5/04). Unocal spokesman, Barry Lane, says unequivocally, ""Karzai was never, in any capacity, an employee, consultant or a consultant of a consultant,"" and Unocal never had a plan to build a Caspian Sea pipeline.Moore mentions that the Taliban visited Texas while President Bush was governor to discuss a potential project with Unocal. While Moore implies that then-Governor Bush met with the Taliban, no such meeting occurred. The Taliban delegation did, however, meet with the Clinton Administration on this visit (Source: Weekly Standard).Fahrenheit Lie #6: Even readily available figures are exaggerated for effect in Fahrenheit 9/11. The claims have a basis in reality, making them believable, but are false nonetheless.In the film, Moore asks Craig Unger, author of House of Bush, House of Saud, ""How much money do the Saudis have invested in America, roughly?"" to which Unger responds, ""Uh, I've heard figures as high as $860 billion.""The Institute for Research: Middle Eastern Policy reports that worldwide Saudi investment approximated $700 billion - a figure much lower than Unger alleges the Saudi government to have invested in the U.S. The Institute reports that 60 percent of that $700 billion - roughly $420 billion, less than half of what Unger ""heard"" - was actually invested in the United States by the Saudi government.Fahrenheit Lie #7: ""Moore's film suggests that [President] Bush has close family ties to the bin Laden family - principally through [President] Bush's father's relationship with the Carlyle Group, a private investment firm. The president's father, George H.W. Bush, was a senior adviser to the Carlyle Group's Asian affiliate until recently; members of the bin Laden family - who own one of Saudi Arabia's biggest construction firms - had invested $2 million in a Carlyle Group fund.Bush Sr. and the bin Ladens have since severed ties with the Carlyle Group, which in any case has a bipartisan roster of partners, including Bill Clinton's former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt. The movie quotes author Dan Briody claiming that the Carlyle Group 'gained' from September 11 because it owned United Defense, a military contractor. Carlyle Group spokesman Chris Ullman notes that United Defense holds a special distinction among U.S. defense contractors that is not mentioned in Moore's movie: the firm's $11 billion Crusader artillery rocket system developed for the U.S. Army is one of the only weapons systems canceled by the Bush administration."" (Source: Kopel, Independence Institute.)"" There is another famous investor in Carlyle whom Moore does not reveal: George Soros. But the fact that the anti-Bush billionaire [Soros] has invested in Carlyle would detract from Moore's simplistic conspiracy theory."" (Source: Kopel, Independence Institute.)Fahrenheit Lie #8: Not revealing relevant facts is dishonest enough. But to paint the Bush Administration as sympathetic and friendly to the Taliban prior to September 11, is not only dishonest, but maliciously so.Moore shows film of a March 2001 visit to the United States by a Taliban delegation, claiming that the Administration ""welcomed"" the Taliban official, Sayed Hashemi, ""to tour the United States to help improve the image of the Taliban."" But the Administration did not welcome the Taliban with open arms. In fact, the State Department rejected the Taliban's claim that it had complied with U.S. requests to isolate bin Laden. To demonstrate even further the Administration's contempt for the Taliban and its illegitimacy, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher - on the day of the terrorist regime's visit - said, ""We don't recognize any government in Afghanistan.""Fahrenheit Lie #9: Moore does more than simply downplay the threat posed to the U.S. by the former Hussein regime in Iraq. He goes so far as to assert that Saddam ""never threatened to attack the United States.""If by ""attack the United States"" one interprets this claim to mean that Saddam never threatened to send troops to the United States, then Mr. Moore has a point. But Saddam Hussein clearly sought to attack the United States within his own sphere of influence, even though he didn't have the resources to attack U.S. soil from his side of the world: On November 15, 1997, ""the main propaganda organ for the Saddam regime, the newspaper Babel (which was run by Saddam Hussein's son Uday), ordered: 'American and British interests, embassies, and naval ships in the Arab region should be the targets of military operations and commando attacks by Arab political forces.'"" (Source: Kopel, Independence Institute.) In addition, ""Iraqi forces fired, every day, for 10 years, on the aircraft that patrolled the no-fly zones and staved off further genocide in the north and south of the country,"" (Source: New York Times, 12/1/03). Saddam Hussein also provided safe haven to terrorists who killed Americans, like Abu Nidal; funded suicide bombers in Israel who certainly killed Americans; and ran the Iraqi police, which plotted to assassinate former President George Bush.There are also fifty-nine deceits in Michael Moore's film, in a list compiled by Davie Kopel of the Independence Institute.

As the #1 Amazon reviewer for non-fiction, including most of the important books about national security, 9/11, oil, and terrorism, I have to state there are exactly TWO points of truth in this shallow stupid little film:1) the photo of Bush reading a book upside down was a fabrication, Bush was actually listening.2) Clinton blew it.  Correct. Madeline Albright will go down in history for refusing to let her staff report terrorism honestly, and Tony Lake will go down in history for failing to get it right.  It bears mention that then Commandant of the Marine Corps Al Gray did get it right, in his article ""Global Intelligence Challenges of the 1990's"" published in the fall of 1988, but no one wanted to listen.I am impressed by the teacher of color who was in charge of the classroom that day, recounting how she felt Bush was truly presidential, and wise not to add to the panic by rushing out of the room.  Absolutely.  Good point.The rest of this extreme rightist propaganda tract is totally disconnected from reality and the truth.  The movie claims that Gore lost because of Nader, and completely ignores the hard documented proof that the Florida leeadership acted to disenfranchise over 35,000 people of color, one reason that the Bush family was so confident, in advance, of victory in  Florida.  This trashy film fails to address the many angry Representatives and the inert Senate, including Gore, who failed to use the power of Congress to redress the impeachable wrong done to America in 2000 (and again, this time in Ohio, in 2004).Anything that features snap-shots of Ann Coulter is very likely to be loosely related to the truth, reality, or the public interest.I am glad I watched this film, because it reconfirms my gravest fears--the extreme right in America now has a propaganda machine more powerful that Hitler's, and a brainwashed following more lethal than the Hilter Youth.  This is seriously troubing stuff.I gave Moore four stars, one star down for being too glib by half.  That's an honest assessment.

Dick Morris makes the profound insight that Al Gore's name is similar to the word ""algorithm"";  Ann Coulter says the word ""Kurd""--a word she claims liberals never use; thus, proving once and for all she's a conservative; Kopel mentions one or two of his 59 Deceits (I guess they didn't have time for the rest), Zell Miller states that public nuisances are like copperheads who ought to be smashed;  Ed Koch claims that most of those who oppose the patriot act don't know what it says (neglecting the fact that those who oppose it actually do so for what it DOESN'T say [like define ""terrorist""]), and actor Ron Silver gives several soliloquies that demonstrate how best to act like someone with a chip on his shoulder (or is that a log in the eye?).As for the negative side, they mainly have to do with mis-truths (naw, you say?): but HYPE actually out-does Fahrenheit in HYPE when somebody claims: ""What's not being shown on TV, and what you'll never come and understand is a group of children flying a kite. Under the Taliban that would probably be their death."" The speaker here is referring to Moore's depiction of life before the Iraqi invasion, including a scene where children are shown flying a kite. The speaker, however, goes at length to mix up the conflict in Iraq with the one in Afghanistan. Actually, if you listen to what's implied by quite a few of the speeches here, you'll find a lot of the tirades guilty of this.Much of HYPE accentuates the trivial (e.g., Democrats also invested in Carlyle [this doesn't exclude the fact that Bush Sr. was once one of its senior advisors]; also complaining that Moore used footage in the public record without the participant's permission ... it happens, it's public!). It's efficient, though, in the manner it expands on a half-truth, e.g., failing to mention that the proof of al-queda's involvement with the USS Cole bombing didn't materialize until May 2001 (i.e, Bush's watch, and as Ann Coulter would say, he did nothing). FahrenHYPE (and HYPE it is) also goes so far as to claim that Moore's film is unpatriotic and, beyond that, aids terrorists. But I don't mind HEIT being seen outside of the U.S. since the film patriotically shows that dissent is acceptable in the U.S.. Bush isn't ""America"", after all. He's a hired hand whose office has to adhere to the checks and balances our nation's founders assigned to it.Overall, the quality of the arguments here are like the one specified on the DVD's back cover: ""Is Michael Moore out for the truth, or is he out to get rich?"" This is a bad argument of giving a choice between only two options while more are likely (i.e., a false dichotomy). In this case, it excludes the film's real intention: to discredit Bush.

863962,A16GGCDUETTTDB,B00068VAOG,T-Man,"[21, 29]","I'm so glad that I rented this movie from Netflix instead of actually buying it.This movie barely does much rebuttal of ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" and is almost laughable at certain parts. Indeed, this documentary proves that Michael Moore perhaps did not give the ENTIRE story in Fahrenheit 9/11 in certain parts. But what this documentary does is it totally botches the story of Election Night 2000, by merely mentioning that certain ""liberally biased"" newspapers confirmed the recount was in George W. Bush favor. What they did not mention (and what Michael Moore DID mention) was how thousands of black voters (and we all know how 90% of blacks vote) were wrongfully knocked off the voters list, and how many ballots were faulty, and how Katherine Harris and George W. Bush's buddies on the Supreme Court stopped the recount. Al Gore's biggest mistake was not ordering a statewide hand recount.Also, this documentary is EXTREMELY heavy on opinion and conjecture. Merely 15 minutes is dedicated to people talking about their experiences in Manhattan on September 11th. And merely 70% of the documentary is opinion anyway, perhaps 40% of it from Dick Morris, Clinton's fired advisor. I can only remember them using and citing actual documentation and news sources twice, the first one to show that Michael Moore allegedly misrepresented a news article, and one quote from the 9/11 Commission Report, an organization of which Bush tried to prevent the formation (an undisputed fact from Michael Moore's documentary not mentioned here).There are two interviews in particular that were just awful. One of them was by Peter Damon. He was the amputee at Walter Reed. Moore merely had him in his documentary for 5 seconds, but Peter Damon went on to say that Michael Moore quoted him out of context and portrayed his interview as though he was against the war. The fact is if you look at Moore's documentary, he quoted Damon verbatim, when Damon simply said that he had his limbs shot off but that he was fine with the drugs they gave him. I respect Damon's service to the country and his sacrifice, but he was way out of line in accusing Michael Moore and attempting to sue him for inaccurately quoting him.Another interview that was extremely fishy was an interview right at the end. I do not remember the lady's name. But the documentary claimed that Michael Moore ""exploited the tragedy"" of a family who lost their son in Iraq, and were angry about Bush and war in general. They claimed that this was one of the members of that family who were in Moore's documentary. But closer inspection shows that she was not, and that she's not even related to them.All in all, while this documentary perhaps taught me to see if Michael Moore is telling the WHOLE story, it does nothing to prove him wrong. Too much opinion, not enough rebuttal. And next time, if you are going to accuse Michael Moore of collaborating with Hezbollah, PROVE IT, with either a video tape or documents. Those are the sources Michael Moore used and showed us, and you, Dick Morris, used nothing but opinion.",2,Not much rebuttal,1184630400,"07 17, 2007",2007,3067,"[""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'rented', 'movie', 'Netflix', 'instead', 'actually', 'buying', 'it.This', 'movie', 'barely', 'much', 'rebuttal', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'almost', 'laughable', 'certain', 'parts', 'Indeed', 'documentary', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'perhaps', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'ENTIRE', 'story', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'certain', 'parts', 'what', 'documentary', 'totally', 'story', 'Election', 'Night', '2000', 'merely', 'mentioning', 'certain', 'liberally', 'biased', 'newspapers', 'confirmed', 'recount', 'was', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'favor', 'What', 'did', 'not', 'mention', 'what', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'DID', 'mention', 'was', 'how', 'thousands', 'black', 'voters', 'know', 'how', '90', '%', 'blacks', 'vote', 'were', 'wrongfully', 'knocked', 'off', 'voters', 'list', 'how', 'many', 'ballots', 'were', 'faulty', 'how', 'Katherine', 'Harris', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'buddies', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'stopped', 'recount', 'Al', 'Gore', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'was', 'not', 'ordering', 'statewide', 'hand', 'recount.Also', 'documentary', 'EXTREMELY', 'heavy', 'opinion', 'conjecture', 'Merely', '15', 'minutes', 'dedicated', 'people', 'talking', 'experiences', 'Manhattan', 'September', '11th', 'merely', '70', '%', 'documentary', 'opinion', 'anyway', 'perhaps', '40', '%', 'Dick', 'Morris', 'Clinton', 'fired', 'advisor', 'can', 'only', 'remember', 'using', 'citing', 'actual', 'documentation', 'news', 'sources', 'twice', 'first', 'one', 'show', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'allegedly', 'misrepresented', 'news', 'article', 'one', 'quote', '9/11', 'Commission', 'Report', 'organization', 'Bush', 'tried', 'prevent', 'formation', 'undisputed', 'fact', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'documentary', 'not', 'mentioned', 'here', 'are', 'two', 'interviews', 'particular', 'were', 'just', 'awful', 'One', 'was', 'Peter', 'Damon', 'was', 'amputee', 'Walter', 'Reed', 'Moore', 'merely', 'had', 'documentary', '5', 'seconds', 'Peter', 'Damon', 'went', 'say', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'quoted', 'context', 'portrayed', 'interview', 'was', 'war', 'fact', 'look', 'Moore', 'documentary', 'quoted', 'Damon', 'verbatim', 'when', 'Damon', 'simply', 'said', 'had', 'limbs', 'shot', 'off', 'was', 'fine', 'drugs', 'gave', 'respect', 'Damon', 'service', 'country', 'sacrifice', 'was', 'way', 'line', 'accusing', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'attempting', 'sue', 'inaccurately', 'quoting', 'interview', 'was', 'extremely', 'fishy', 'was', 'interview', 'right', 'end', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'lady', 'name', 'documentary', 'claimed', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'exploited', 'tragedy', 'family', 'who', 'lost', 'son', 'Iraq', 'were', 'angry', 'Bush', 'war', 'general', 'claimed', 'was', 'one', 'members', 'family', 'who', 'were', 'Moore', 'documentary', 'closer', 'inspection', 'shows', 'was', 'not', 'not', 'even', 'related', 'them.All', 'documentary', 'perhaps', 'taught', 'see', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'telling', 'WHOLE', 'story', 'nothing', 'prove', 'wrong', 'Too', 'much', 'opinion', 'not', 'enough', 'rebuttal', 'next', 'time', 'are', 'going', 'accuse', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'collaborating', 'Hezbollah', 'PROVE', 'IT', 'video', 'tape', 'documents', 'are', 'sources', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'used', 'showed', 'Dick', 'Morris', 'used', 'nothing', 'opinion']",N/A
863963,A3EJVZ5LCBP61X,B00068VAOG,"TOMMY C ELLIS ""Prison Rev.""","[31, 54]","First, all the disclaimers.  I watched Moore's film two days ago, and ultimately gave three stars for providing a decent, emotionally compelling, yet often uneven piece of propaganda.  I also voted for Bush, and have been hopeful, yet ambivalent about the war in Iraq.As a film, Fahrenhype 9/11 is similar in quality to Moore's offering, yet more straightforward and dignified in approach.  While Moore often comes across as peevish and disdainful, the many speakers here communicate mostly dismay and wonder, as if to say, ""We know you do not like Bush, but why would you ridicule your own country and military before the world?""  Additionally, the tone of this film is almost like an extended newsmagazine doing an investigation--an appropriate response to Moore's sarcastic anti-Bush commercial.As for the debate, Fahrenhype is a clear winner over Farhrenheit on the following counts:1.  Effectively disputes some of Moore's rather sensational conspiracy theories:  That Bush's politically connected friends stole the election for him, that there is a sinister Bush/Saudi connection, and that the real reason for this war is to enrich the President's oil buddies.2.  Effectively proves that some of Moore's evidence is misleading, that some was even doctored, and that he callously used out-of-context clips from people who in actuality oppose his views.3.  Ultimately, Fahrenhype 9/11 proves that Moore did not convincingly prove his case.  In classic debate, those who argue for change have the burden of proof, and Moore collapses under this load!Bottom-line:  Fahrenhype 9/11 bests the movie it critiques, but loses a point for its failure to reach a broad audience, and to escape the handicap that it is also a Republican propaganda production.  Bush won the election, so Mission Accomplished.  However, both of these films will garner amens from partisans, but may not draw much attention from the ambivalent majority in this country who are wary of a war drawn long, yet not convinced that there is a better alternative to staying the course.",4,Effective rebuttal to Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11,1126656000,"09 14, 2005",2005,2052,"['First', 'disclaimers', 'watched', 'Moore', 'film', 'two', 'days', 'ago', 'ultimately', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'providing', 'decent', 'emotionally', 'compelling', 'yet', 'often', 'uneven', 'piece', 'propaganda', 'also', 'voted', 'Bush', 'have', 'been', 'hopeful', 'yet', 'ambivalent', 'war', 'Iraq.As', 'film', 'Fahrenhype', '9/11', 'similar', 'quality', 'Moore', 'offering', 'yet', 'more', 'straightforward', 'dignified', 'approach', 'Moore', 'often', 'across', 'peevish', 'disdainful', 'many', 'speakers', 'here', 'communicate', 'mostly', 'dismay', 'wonder', 'say', 'know', 'do', 'not', 'Bush', 'why', 'would', 'ridicule', 'own', 'country', 'military', 'world', 'Additionally', 'tone', 'film', 'almost', 'extended', 'newsmagazine', 'doing', 'investigation', 'appropriate', 'response', 'Moore', 'sarcastic', 'anti-Bush', 'commercial.As', 'debate', 'Fahrenhype', 'clear', 'winner', 'Farhrenheit', 'following', 'counts:1', 'Effectively', 'Moore', 'rather', 'sensational', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'Bush', 'politically', 'connected', 'friends', 'stole', 'election', 'sinister', 'Bush/Saudi', 'connection', 'real', 'reason', 'war', 'enrich', 'President', 'oil', 'buddies.2', 'Effectively', 'Moore', 'evidence', 'misleading', 'was', 'even', 'doctored', 'callously', 'used', 'out-of-context', 'clips', 'people', 'who', 'actuality', 'oppose', 'views.3', 'Ultimately', 'Fahrenhype', '9/11', 'proves', 'Moore', 'did', 'not', 'convincingly', 'prove', 'case', 'classic', 'debate', 'who', 'argue', 'change', 'have', 'burden', 'proof', 'Moore', 'load', 'Bottom-line', 'Fahrenhype', '9/11', 'bests', 'movie', 'point', 'failure', 'reach', 'broad', 'audience', 'escape', 'handicap', 'also', 'Republican', 'propaganda', 'production', 'Bush', 'won', 'election', 'Mission', 'Accomplished', 'However', 'films', 'will', 'garner', 'amens', 'partisans', 'may', 'not', 'draw', 'much', 'attention', 'ambivalent', 'majority', 'country', 'who', 'are', 'wary', 'war', 'drawn', 'long', 'yet', 'not', 'convinced', 'better', 'alternative', 'staying', 'course']",N/A
