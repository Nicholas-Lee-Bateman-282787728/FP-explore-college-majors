257749,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,6301599446,Craig Connell,"[6, 6]","This is often pointed to cynically by sportswriters and fans as the ultimate ridiculously sugarcoated sports-hero film of all time. Who's to argue? If you know Babe Ruth and what he was like, you almost have to laugh at some of the stuff in here.  Yet, this film is old-fashioned charm, and despite the negatives to it, I enjoy watching it.  It's so corny, it's good.That's not to say Ruth was a bad man, because he wasn't. He was extremely likable guy whom his teammates all loved, he was fantastic with kids and very, very generous man. But he also had a ton  of faults, too, some of which got him in big trouble with his managers and league officials. His health was a problem at times, thanks, in part to his opulent lifestyle. He was a glutton and an adulterer and life wasn't fun for him as he got unfairly passed over to be a manager, something he desperately sought.His was very crude and profane.Very few if any of these negative qualities are the in the film - just the good 'ole boy - the kind William Bendix played on his TV show, ""The Life Of Riley.""Also unrealistic - and typical of sports movies in the ""classic era"" - is Bendix trying to throw and hit a baseball. Thank goodness modern-day movies don't have actors like this who are clueless on how to play the actual sport they are portraying.Yet, as sweet and unrealistic as this film can be, it's a lot better than doing the reverse, which is what Hollywood did to the Babe in 1992 in the John Goodman movie. They portray the Babe in mostly negative terms.Too bad you usually get two extremes when it comes biographies made in Hollywood. In the ""classic era"" films, our heroes could do no wrong. Since the '60s, our heroes are shown to be blemished more than anything else.

257750,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6301599446,Dr. James Gardner,"[0, 0]","""The Babe Ruth Story"" is a 1948 black and white sentimental biography of baseball's greatest slugger. ""The Bambino"" was the biggest celebrity athlete of all time - in fact, he invented the celebrity athlete. His records for most home runs lifetime (714), most home runs in a season (60), lifetime slugging percentage (.69), season batting record (.393). most scoreless innings in World Series play (29), and lifetime RBIs (2,217) stood for decades, and they were only bested in the modern age when playing conditions were vastly improved and the season lengthened. To get an idea of just how great ""the Sultan of Swat"" was, in 1927 when he hit 60 home runs, this was more than the combined home run total of the entire League.The film was rushed into production when it was learned that the Babe was dying from cancer. ""The Pride of the Yankees"" about Lou Gehrig had been a big hit in 1942 and the producers were hoping for another hit. The film premiered on July 26 1948 and Ruth died 3 weeks later on August 16.The film touches on the major points in Ruth's career -* He grew up in an orphanage* He started as a pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles in 1913* He was traded to Boston Red Sox  in 1914 where he transitioned to the outfield* He was traded to the Yankees in 1920 where he emerged fully* The Yankees traded him to the Boston Braves in 1935 and retired at the end of the season* He appeared in ""Pride of the Yankees"" in 1942But for some strange reason it completely ignores his first marriage and his daughter Dorothy.William Bendix (1906-64) plays the Babe. He is best remembered from the radio and TV series ""Life of Riley"" (1949-50, 1953-8). He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for ""Wake Island"" (1942), but I think his best performances were in ""Lifeboat"" (1944) and ""Connecticut Yankee"" (1949).FWIW  - As a child, Bendix had been a bat boy for the NY Giants and claimed to personally witness over 100 of the Babe's home runs.Claire Trevor (1910-2000) plays Ruth's (second) wife. She was dubbed the ""Queen of film noir"" because of her roles in films like ""Street of Chance"" (1942), ""Murder My Sweet"" (1944), and ""Born to Kill"" (1947), but in fact she had quite a varied career in multiple genres and was nominated for an Oscar 3 times (""Dead End"", ""Key Largo"", ""The High and the Mighty"") and an Emmy 2 times (1950, 1954). She made more than 50 films before transitioning to TV in the 50s. I liked her best in ""The High and the Mighty"" and ""Key Largo"".The NY Times said the film was ""awful, almost stupefyingly so"" but ""an experience not to be missed"".There have been a plethora of baseball films in general and biographies in particular. Some of the better bio flicks include ""61"" (2001), ""Cobb"" (1994), ""The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg"" (1998), ""A League of their Own"" (1992), and ""Fear Strikes Out"" (1957).The Babe himself was covered in this film and in ""My Dad the Babe"" (1988), ""Babe Ruth"" (1991), and ""The Babe"" (1992)Bottom line - the type of film you can watch with your young children, but otherwise laughable and not really the kind of tribute the Babe should have received.",3,The Babe Deserved Better,1337644800,"05 22, 2012",2012,3109,"['Babe', 'Ruth', 'Story', '1948', 'black', 'white', 'sentimental', 'biography', 'baseball', 'greatest', 'slugger', 'Bambino', 'was', 'biggest', 'celebrity', 'athlete', 'time', 'fact', 'invented', 'celebrity', 'athlete', 'records', 'most', 'home', 'runs', 'lifetime', '714', 'most', 'home', 'runs', 'season', '60', 'lifetime', 'slugging', 'percentage', '.69', 'season', 'batting', 'record', '.393', 'most', 'scoreless', 'innings', 'World', 'Series', 'play', '29', 'lifetime', 'RBIs', '2,217', 'stood', 'decades', 'were', 'only', 'bested', 'modern', 'age', 'when', 'playing', 'conditions', 'were', 'vastly', 'improved', 'season', 'lengthened', 'get', 'idea', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'Sultan', 'Swat', 'was', '1927', 'when', 'hit', '60', 'home', 'runs', 'was', 'more', 'combined', 'home', 'run', 'total', 'entire', 'League.The', 'film', 'was', 'rushed', 'production', 'when', 'was', 'learned', 'Babe', 'was', 'dying', 'cancer', 'Pride', 'Yankees', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'had', 'been', 'big', 'hit', '1942', 'producers', 'were', 'hoping', 'hit', 'film', 'premiered', 'July', '26', '1948', 'Ruth', 'died', '3', 'weeks', 'later', 'August', '16.The', 'film', 'touches', 'major', 'points', 'Ruth', 'career', '-*', 'grew', 'up', 'orphanage*', 'started', 'pitcher', 'Baltimore', 'Orioles', '1913*', 'was', 'traded', 'Boston', 'Red', 'Sox', '1914', 'where', 'transitioned', 'outfield*', 'was', 'traded', 'Yankees', '1920', 'where', 'emerged', 'fully*', 'Yankees', 'traded', 'Boston', 'Braves', '1935', 'retired', 'end', 'season*', 'appeared', 'Pride', 'Yankees', '1942But', 'strange', 'reason', 'completely', 'first', 'marriage', 'daughter', 'Dorothy.William', 'Bendix', '1906-64', 'Babe', 'best', 'remembered', 'radio', 'TV', 'series', 'Life', 'Riley', '1949-50', '1953-8', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Wake', 'Island', '1942', 'think', 'best', 'performances', 'were', 'Lifeboat', '1944', 'Connecticut', 'Yankee', '1949', '.FWIW', 'child', 'Bendix', 'had', 'been', 'bat', 'boy', 'NY', 'Giants', 'claimed', 'personally', 'witness', '100', 'Babe', 'home', 'runs.Claire', 'Trevor', '1910-2000', 'Ruth', 'second', 'wife', 'was', 'dubbed', 'Queen', 'film', 'noir', 'roles', 'films', 'Street', 'Chance', '1942', 'Murder', 'My', 'Sweet', '1944', 'Born', 'Kill', '1947', 'fact', 'had', 'quite', 'varied', 'career', 'multiple', 'genres', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', '3', 'times', 'Dead', 'End', 'Key', 'Largo', 'High', 'Mighty', 'Emmy', '2', 'times', '1950', '1954', 'made', 'more', '50', 'films', 'transitioning', 'TV', '50s', 'liked', 'best', 'High', 'Mighty', 'Key', 'Largo', '.The', 'NY', 'Times', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'awful', 'almost', 'stupefyingly', 'so', 'experience', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'have', 'been', 'plethora', 'baseball', 'films', 'general', 'biographies', 'particular', 'better', 'bio', 'flicks', 'include', '61', '2001', 'Cobb', '1994', 'Life', 'Times', 'Hank', 'Greenberg', '1998', 'League', 'Own', '1992', 'Fear', 'Out', '1957', '.The', 'Babe', 'was', 'covered', 'film', 'My', 'Dad', 'Babe', '1988', 'Babe', 'Ruth', '1991', 'Babe', '1992', 'Bottom', 'line', 'type', 'film', 'can', 'watch', 'young', 'children', 'otherwise', 'laughable', 'not', 'really', 'kind', 'tribute', 'Babe', 'should', 'have', 'received']",N/A

Lou Gehrig at least had accomplished actor Gary Cooper play him. He also had the real Babe Ruth & other players in cameos. No players appeared in this one. Babe got buffoon,  William Bendix, later of Kill the Umpire & Life of Riley fame. He's talented but a comedian. Babe Ruth's life before during & after baseball is covered in rather pedestrian fashion. That he loved kids is well known. I'm very dubious of combining the famous ""called shot"" during the 1932 World Series & the promise to hit one for the little dying boy listening on the radio. That either one actually happened will always be debated but combining them in one moment is a bit much. The end is one we are all too familiar with. Everyone can see the end of the athlete's career except that person himself. It ends badly & he never realizes his dream of managing. So it is. The Babe is going to die of cancer. Must not say that word on screen. His imminent death is drawn out & every baseball metaphor is utilized. In the end the experimental drug he agrees to take advances medical treatment for thousands.
