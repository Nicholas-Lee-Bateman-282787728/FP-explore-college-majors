Since I am of Greek descent, I was attracted by the title, which for a Greek is like yelling , ""Yippee!"" The actors were great, particularly the 3 women dressed entirely in black,( which signifies they were all widows, as women customarily wear black for the rest of their lives at least more traditionally minded women do) who show up throughout the movie, as a humorous Greek chorus. The location shots are gorgeous, the food and restaurant traditional.

No longer do all archeologists grab shovel and brush, ready to dig, clean, and interpret.  Some use satellite imagery, ground-penetrating radar, and other remote sensing devices to uncover our history.  Eventually, however, it comes back to the person with the shovel and the brush.In Opa!, Eric (Matthew Modine), a remote sensing specialist, is searching for ""St. John's Cup,"" a religious artifact that was also sought by his late father on a Greek island.  He partners with one of his father's colleagues, Tierrney (a morbidly obese Richard Griffiths), to discover the Cup, but the location is beneath the island community's favorite taverna, a lively restaurant with music and dancing.  The taverna owner, Katerina (Agni Scott) is a gregarious single mother, and her manager, Spiros (Alki David) is ferociously protective of her.Katerina and Eric enjoy each other's company.  ""Never lie to her,"" counsels Spiros.  But everyone watching this movie can predict the conflict that will happen as Katerina learns that Eric is behind the plans to destroy her beloved traverna to find St. John's Cup.Will their relationship survive?  Will the Cup be found?  Will Tierrney ever be able to pay his bar bill?  Does Eric have more than one expression?  Can I go swimming with Katerina?Regardless of this predictability, I still enjoyed the film.  In both English and Greek, with subtitles.Opa!",4,"Predictable, yet enjoyable!",1298160000,"02 20, 2011",2011,1441,"['Archeology', 'most', 'sciences', 'changed', 'time', 'No', 'longer', 'do', 'archeologists', 'grab', 'shovel', 'brush', 'ready', 'dig', 'clean', 'interpret', 'use', 'satellite', 'imagery', 'ground-penetrating', 'radar', 'other', 'remote', 'sensing', 'devices', 'uncover', 'history', 'Eventually', 'however', 'back', 'person', 'shovel', 'brush.In', 'Opa', 'Eric', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'remote', 'sensing', 'specialist', 'searching', 'St.', 'John', 'Cup', 'religious', 'artifact', 'was', 'also', 'sought', 'late', 'father', 'Greek', 'island', 'partners', 'one', 'father', 'colleagues', 'Tierrney', 'morbidly', 'obese', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'discover', 'Cup', 'location', 'island', 'community', 'favorite', 'taverna', 'lively', 'restaurant', 'music', 'dancing', 'taverna', 'owner', 'Katerina', 'Agni', 'Scott', 'gregarious', 'single', 'mother', 'manager', 'Spiros', 'Alki', 'David', 'ferociously', 'protective', 'her.Katerina', 'Eric', 'enjoy', 'other', 'company', 'Never', 'lie', 'Spiros', 'everyone', 'watching', 'movie', 'can', 'predict', 'conflict', 'will', 'happen', 'Katerina', 'Eric', 'plans', 'destroy', 'beloved', 'traverna', 'find', 'St.', 'John', 'Cup.Will', 'relationship', 'survive', 'Will', 'Cup', 'be', 'found', 'Will', 'Tierrney', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'pay', 'bar', 'bill', 'Does', 'Eric', 'have', 'more', 'one', 'expression', 'Can', 'go', 'swimming', 'Katerina', 'Regardless', 'predictability', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'English', 'Greek', 'subtitles.Opa']",Opa
