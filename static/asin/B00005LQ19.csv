I perspired (the heater was on, but that wasn't the only reason, I'm sure) and felt challenged but not tortured. The combination of pilates, yoga, dance, etc. really made the workout very fluid and non-work-out like...it went much faster because she moved on to one exercise after another...and I didn't feel any particular move was overdone.Overall...effective workout. Much better than I had anticipated.",4,Better Than I Expected,1071273600,"12 13, 2003",2003,475,"['tape', 'was', 'definitely', 'more', 'effective', 'imagined', 'would', 'be', 'perspired', 'heater', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'reason', ""'m"", 'sure', 'felt', 'challenged', 'not', 'tortured', 'combination', 'pilates', 'yoga', 'dance', 'etc', 'really', 'made', 'workout', 'very', 'fluid', 'non-work-out', 'went', 'much', 'faster', 'moved', 'one', 'exercise', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'particular', 'move', 'was', 'overdone.Overall', 'effective', 'workout', 'Much', 'better', 'had', 'anticipated']",Yoga Fusion: Power- Featuring Teigh McDonough VHS

The truth is probably somewhere in between.First, you should know that I am a sucker for: yoga, pilates, fusion and easy dance and chi kung or tai chi.  This tape has a little bit of all of that, so it should have been perfect for me.  Instead, I found myself staring at the tv, wondering how this video could have been made in the first place.The yoga here was decent, but nothing to write home about and nothing you won't find in any of the other newer yoga releases.  There isn't that much chi kung here- maybe four moves- and they weren't anything to get excited about, either.  What drove me to actively hate this video were the Pilates moves.  I am not a stickler for following the classical sequence all the time, although I do see the benefits.  What I am becoming increasingly picky about is the number of repetitions, especially when the instructor makes modifications to the form.  The Pilates here is so unsafe- particularly The Hundred- that there was no way I would do this video even once or recommend it to anyone under any circumstances.  She does not discuss the proper breathing or the fact that you need to pull your lower abdominals in throughout the movements.  She also performs too many repetitions of the Single Straight Leg Stretch and the Double Straight Leg Stretch.  I honestly feel that the risk to injure one's back with this tape is very high, especially for a beginner.The music and the set didn't do anything for me either.  The music didn't seem to work for the exercises- it was half-mellow, half-expectant- so you were left with the subliminal impression something better was coming.  The set, I believe, is the same set used for Denise Austin's Power Yoga Plus.  I liked what they did with it better on that video.  The color blocks hanging from the ceiling for this video were oddly jarring and only added to my annoyance with the tape.Finally, the tape promises ""a powerful aerobic vinyasa"".  Again, I just previewed the tape, but this didn't look at all aerobic to me...",1,Save your money,1014508800,"02 24, 2002",2002,2134,"['have', 'almost', 'never', 'hated', 'video', 'first', 'sight', ""'m"", 'getting', 'more', 'selective', 'age', 'just', 'really', 'bad', 'truth', 'probably', 'somewhere', 'between.First', 'should', 'know', 'am', 'sucker', 'yoga', 'pilates', 'fusion', 'easy', 'dance', 'chi', 'kung', 'tai', 'chi', 'tape', 'little', 'bit', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'Instead', 'found', 'staring', 'tv', 'wondering', 'how', 'video', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'first', 'place.The', 'yoga', 'here', 'was', 'decent', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'nothing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'other', 'newer', 'yoga', 'releases', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'chi', 'kung', 'here-', 'maybe', 'four', 'moves-', 'were', ""n't"", 'anything', 'get', 'excited', 'What', 'drove', 'actively', 'hate', 'video', 'were', 'Pilates', 'moves', 'am', 'not', 'stickler', 'following', 'classical', 'sequence', 'time', 'do', 'see', 'benefits', 'What', 'am', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'picky', 'number', 'repetitions', 'especially', 'when', 'instructor', 'modifications', 'form', 'Pilates', 'here', 'so', 'unsafe-', 'particularly', 'Hundred-', 'was', 'way', 'would', 'do', 'video', 'even', 'once', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'circumstances', 'not', 'discuss', 'proper', 'breathing', 'fact', 'need', 'pull', 'lower', 'abdominals', 'movements', 'also', 'performs', 'too', 'many', 'repetitions', 'Single', 'Straight', 'Leg', 'Stretch', 'Double', 'Straight', 'Leg', 'Stretch', 'honestly', 'feel', 'risk', 'injure', 'one', 'back', 'tape', 'very', 'high', 'especially', 'beginner.The', 'music', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'work', 'exercises-', 'was', 'half-mellow', 'half-expectant-', 'were', 'left', 'subliminal', 'impression', 'something', 'better', 'was', 'coming', 'set', 'believe', 'same', 'set', 'used', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'Plus', 'liked', 'what', 'did', 'better', 'video', 'color', 'blocks', 'hanging', 'ceiling', 'video', 'were', 'oddly', 'jarring', 'only', 'added', 'annoyance', 'tape.Finally', 'tape', 'powerful', 'aerobic', 'vinyasa', 'Again', 'just', 'previewed', 'tape', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'aerobic']",Yoga Fusion: Power- Featuring Teigh McDonough VHS

It didn't even feel like a work out so much as a stretching routine. I never really understood just how inflexible I was until attempting this workout; I felt so stretched out afterwards, it felt great. I agree however, that I had to look up at the TV alot, which can be stressful on the neck, to understand how to do some of the movements.",4,I generally hate yoga but this was fun,1328486400,"02 6, 2012",2012,438,"['incorporated', 'Pilates', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'dance', 'movements', 'workout', 'was', 'fun', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'feel', 'work', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'stretching', 'routine', 'never', 'really', 'understood', 'just', 'how', 'inflexible', 'was', 'attempting', 'workout', 'felt', 'so', 'stretched', 'out', 'afterwards', 'felt', 'great', 'agree', 'however', 'had', 'look', 'up', 'TV', 'alot', 'can', 'be', 'stressful', 'neck', 'understand', 'how', 'do', 'movements']",Yoga Fusion: Power- Featuring Teigh McDonough VHS

The pilates section is (in my humble opinion) high intermediate/advanced. Beginners beware! There's not enough modification presented! The yoga portion was a lot of fun, flowed well, but was not too difficult. I think the entire video flows very well. The best part is that my butt and abs get a great workout.

It combines moves from yoga, Pilates, dance, and tai chi in a fast moving routine, so your heart rate is raised and you break a sweat. When it is over you feel the benefits of both the aerobic quality and the strengthening and toning, and best of all, you also reap the mind/body rewards of some wonderful tai-chi and yoga.  I'm in decent shape and have experience with yoga and pilates, and found this tape to be challenging and interesting.  I love it.
