It is the second worst film I have ever seen (first being The Dead Matter - don't bother looking it up) and I pride myself on the number of Sci-Fi originals I have watched. At least sci-fi knows better than to take itself seriously! The dialogue is awful and the acting is even worse. You can't sympathize for a single character. The story attempts to make the viewer feel for the lead actress because her father died and she doesn't get along with her mother. B****, you are not 15 anymore, get over your parental issues. The whole this is just a god awful train wreak. Lovers of gore will be disappointed, as will lovers of decent acting/plot/monster effects/nudity/shock value/not wasting their time.

1442485,A3RRH00L296FSW,B0055CP9D6,Drosophila,"[2, 4]","Horror movies, by definition, are supposed to be horrifying. But Boggy Creek takes a different approach. It decides, for most of its running time, to be simply boring.The movie opens with an arresting sequence involving a young woman fleeing from her life from unknown ""thing"" in the woods. It's a good start, but the filmmakers squander any suspense they might have created by ending this sequence very abruptly when they should have milked it for all it was worth.Then we meet a couple of local cops. From their first scene, it seems like they might become prominent characters in the story, but no, all they really do for the rest of the movie is turn up every half hour or so, stand over a mutilated body and look grim. Oh, and the younger of the two throws up every time he sees blood. (Memo: maybe law enforcement wasn't the smartest career move for you, bud.)Then we meet the heroine of the piece, an actress who looks like a blonde Mandy Moore and likes to jog. And jog. And jog. And then jog some more. Finally she reaches a cabin by a lake. (In these movies, there's ALWAYS a cabin by a lake). Here, she talks with her friend about a little getaway they're about to have in Boggy Creek. Just the two of them. Except various friends and hangers-on start showing up until eventually we end up with a whole contingent of post-teens heading off for Boggy Creek to be threatened by the mysterious creature that's leaving mutilated bodies around for noob cops to puke at the sight of.Once you hit the ""play"" button on your DVD player, you can basically just go off and do something else for an hour. That's right. A full hour. Because in that first hour of this film, NOTHING happens. The characters talk, they flirt, they drink, they have little psychodramas. All the while, a local woodsman broods and cradles his shotgun and mumbles original lines like ""There's something out there."" And that's it. There is a little bit of sasquatch action in the first hour, but not much. The only key character of note who gets killed is so obnoxious that you'll actually be rooting for the bigfoot to take her out. So yeah, hit play and then go do some gardening, or fill in your tax return, or something. I can guarantee it'll be time better spent than watching these characters wander around aimlessly.Finally, around the one hour, eight minute mark, the body count starts rising dramatically, but by then, it's all far too little, far too late. To get to this ""good stuff"", you've got to sit through an hour of some of the most banal dialogue you're ever likely to hear. Ask yourself this: is it really worth it?I admire the filmmakers for attempting to make a scary movie. Their location filming is actually quite good, and the film is competently put together. It's just not directed with much flair or originality. We feel like we've seen this sort of thing a million times before. There's a twist right at the very end that's kinda sorta semi-interesting, but by that stage, I was almost past caring. And you will be too if you decided to spend 90 minutes in Boggy Creek. Venture there at your own peril.

The production values were much better than I expected (lighting, camera work/angles, scenic landscape cinematography, image quality and so on) and the direction and acting was decent with some exceptions. The story and the sasquatch body were the weakest links of this production, but the human body parts were of decent quality. The story really dwells on the the leads grief over the loss of her dad and her issues with her mom throughout the movie. I felt that to much time was put into her character development and not enough on sasquatch and this led to the story bogging down a bit. There is more than a few scenes of sasquatch attacks sprinkled thorughout the movie to try to even the pacing out, but the time wasted on the lead characters dad/mom issues counteracts the attacks scenes. The attacks were less violent than expected/hoped for and they weren't gore filled either. I had hoped that the attacks would have been more violent especially from the guys point of view. I like gore, but its not needed if the attacks are done right, so I'm not real disappointed for the lack of gore. The ending is not the typical for the horror genre and the way it was done left a little to be desired. This is by no means a stealer movie by a long shot, but even with its fare share of flaws it was not a waste of my time. There are so many far worse movies out there and they contain many...many more issues than this one for you to avoid. Watch it just for the nice scenic shots of the swamp they helped sell this ok movie on me. I come from the desert and seeing the lush and rich green foliage landscape with wildlife (birds) and all that water made those scenes seem like an oasis. I will give this one a 3 star rating because its is so much better than so many others out there and if the story was better I would have given it 4 stars which I almost never give out to horror flicks.

1442496,A22Y3XDJ1KE4W5,B0055CP9D6,"sda ""sda""","[0, 0]","Despite all the negative reviews, I really wanted to like this movie. I was much encouraged when the film began with the very cool clips and shots of the bigfoot through the opening credits. I thought that was fantastic, and I got excited about the film. But once we get through the initial set-up killing this thing dives to a slow, slow, SLOW crawl wherein I guess we're supposed to learn about our characters.I didn't really learn anything and I didn't really like any of the characters. In fact, I hated the lead actress who I thought was horrible. The best friend was okay, at best, and the other couple were there to supply the beefcake and cheesecake, as both were very attractive but otherwise added nothing to the film. The only one of the main cast I really liked was the best friend's boyfriend. The rest ranged from dull to terrible... and most of them couldn't act. The local sheriff and his weak-stomached deputy are the best characters in the film... too bad we don't see them for more than a couple minutes. They are pretty much throw-aways. The brooding guy next door wasn't very good and needed to speak the hell up and stop mumbling (a HUGE problem with this movie -- most of the actors mumble and whisper their way through it so that you miss a BIG chunk of dialogue). And that's about it for the characters here, except for some flashbacks of the main girl's childhood with her doting father and miserable mother. So of the lot I found only three characters I liked -- the best friend's boyfriend and the sheriff and deputy, and not one of them had an awful lot to say or do.And for the first hour nothing happens. I mean NOTHING happens. I think there is a glimpse or two of the monster, but otherwise all we get is a whole lot of REALLY dull scenes of our dull and unlikeable group mumbling and whispering and acting badly. There's a little t&a; and sixpack abs I guess to tease and tantalize, but that wasn't nearly enough to pump life into this dull, plodding thing. The one bright spot is the outdoor scenery, which is breathtaking shots of the swamps and bayou, and is probably the best scenery in any bigfoot film I've ever seen (and I'm a HUGE bigfoot film geek). Was a nice change of pace from the usual, standard forests.Eventually our gang goes on a camping trip into the swamp for some reason -- I guess the nice cabin was too good for them? In any event, once out there they are quickly dispatched by the bigfoot. And I mean QUICKLY. After all the long, dull, tedious buildup, the monster takes center stage and slaughters half of the group and chases the other half off into the murky swamps where they also meet their unspeakable fates quickly. We get one final scene that while not a surprise, was a nice touch -- probably the best scene in the whole movie -- and then its over and no one cares. The end.Sigh. What a disappointment. This could have been a great bigfoot movie. One of the best, maybe. The scenery was spectacular and the monster makeup was top-notch, going more in the wildman direction than the typical big ape design. I really liked it a lot. With a better (less DULL) script wherein something actually HAPPENS in the first hour, and the sheriff and deputy have some real part to play, I could have even forgiven the bad acting by the rest of the players. Oh, and if the sound had been better so that you could actually HEAR the dialogue (and the music was just AWFUL, too).So I guess if you are a bigfoot fan then this is worth a look. But if you are seeking a good horror film just keep moving, as this has none of the typical nudity, excessive gore (there's some), or suspense of your typical horror flick.

1442498,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B0055CP9D6,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","We get some sporadic Boggy Creek ""Big Foot"" type scenes and some killing/blood stuff then we head into the meat of the film. Jen (Melissa Carnell) has some personal issues and wants to get away to a remote family cabin in the location of questionable monsters. She invites her bff Maya (Shavon Kirksey) to come along with her. Maya in turn invites David (Damon Lipari) an intelligent guy, a hottie who also has issues. Maya thinks Jen and David can ""hook up."" David in turn brings his girl friend Brooke (Stephanie Honore) who is our spoiled city girl. While they are in the cabin, Maya's boyfriend Tommy (Texas Battle) stops by so we can have someone drop a few f-bombs. Dustin (Cory Hart) is the neighbor with a shotgun who lost his wife to ""that thing"" while skinny dipping in the swamp.The music for the opening jog scene with Jen ran way too long. I thought this was one of those movies that was trying to promote a band. The porch scene had a weird raining/buzzing sound in the background. It was very distracting. Retakes cost money, besides...who will notice?Eventually the kids go camping and you can figure out the rest. The film spent too much time prior to the camping scene. They should have extended the final killing scenes and cut short the rest of the film. I felt I was watching a movie made by someone who has heard what horror films are about, but has never seen one.
