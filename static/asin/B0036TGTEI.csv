1329151,AE75Q9VVBK4ZG,B0036TGTEI,"A Dinosaur-Shaped Car ""Nelson 'burning in hel...","[1, 9]","Hi, today I'm reviewing my favorite show ever, The Boondocks. It reminds me of how Dave Chappelle said the N-word a lot, but this show's characters articulate it weirdly (""nyooogaah"") so they can say it even more, so you know it's not afraid to ""go there!"" Also, it looks like a anime!The family is really mismatched ha ha. One little kid thinks he's a gangsta, but he's actually not yet, because he's just a little kid. His wacky grandfather beats him sometimes. The little afro kid is intellectual. Like his brother he promotes violence, but he promotes ""black revolutionary violence"" not rap gangsta violence which makes him intellectual and stuff. He insults white people which is kewl because white people have ""white privolege,"" which makes them racist and bad. Racism is bad. He also quotes Kahlil Gibran sometimes, who was a smart brown person from Egypt. What a mismatched family...!There's also a fat guy with a lazy eye called Uncle Ruckus who's an uncle tom. That means he has opinions that make him a bad, uncertified black person. He doesn't know that he's being kept down by the white system and hegememony. As we all know, it is impossible for a white person to be poor and a black person to be rich.This show has lots of elements of ""magic realisticism."" Like one time, prof. Martin Luther King comes back from the dead and nobody questions it! He sees things he doesn't like about the black community that Uncle Ruckus agrees with in other episodes. Also that painter who paints ""happy trees"" on TV (Ross Perot) has a gun and gets in a police chase, which is random and wacky so it's instantly funny!",1,Halarious,1289347200,"11 10, 2010",2010,1618,"['Hi', 'today', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'favorite', 'show', 'ever', 'Boondocks', 'how', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'said', 'N-word', 'lot', 'show', 'characters', 'articulate', 'weirdly', 'nyooogaah', 'can', 'say', 'even', 'more', 'know', 'not', 'afraid', 'go', 'there', 'Also', 'anime', 'family', 'really', 'mismatched', 'ha', 'ha', 'One', 'little', 'kid', 'gangsta', 'actually', 'not', 'yet', 'just', 'little', 'kid', 'wacky', 'grandfather', 'sometimes', 'little', 'afro', 'kid', 'intellectual', 'brother', 'violence', 'black', 'revolutionary', 'violence', 'not', 'rap', 'gangsta', 'violence', 'intellectual', 'stuff', 'white', 'people', 'kewl', 'white', 'people', 'have', 'white', 'privolege', 'racist', 'bad', 'Racism', 'bad', 'also', 'Kahlil', 'Gibran', 'sometimes', 'who', 'was', 'smart', 'brown', 'person', 'Egypt', 'What', 'mismatched', 'family', 'also', 'fat', 'guy', 'lazy', 'eye', 'called', 'Uncle', 'Ruckus', 'who', 'uncle', 'tom', 'opinions', 'make', 'bad', 'uncertified', 'black', 'person', ""n't"", 'know', 'being', 'kept', 'down', 'white', 'system', 'hegememony', 'know', 'impossible', 'white', 'person', 'be', 'poor', 'black', 'person', 'be', 'rich.This', 'show', 'lots', 'elements', 'magic', 'realisticism', 'one', 'time', 'prof.', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'back', 'dead', 'nobody', 'questions', 'things', ""n't"", 'like', 'black', 'community', 'Uncle', 'Ruckus', 'other', 'episodes', 'Also', 'painter', 'who', 'happy', 'trees', 'TV', 'Ross', 'Perot', 'gun', 'police', 'chase', 'random', 'wacky', 'instantly', 'funny']",The Boondocks: Season 3

The Red Ball for example shows how the boondocks mix humor with kung fu homages, or Tyler Perry getting ripped a new one on Pause, or the Fried Chicken Flu which just has me cracking up every time, the Boondocks are in their prime!However it seems in each season Aaron McGruder puts in a few BET episodes, which just aren't funny to me, maybe people who are more involved with the tv business ""get it"", but I think he's made his point pretty clear about BET and needs to move on. Rylo Goodlove (I think?) is also a pretty boring character, but besides the afromentioned points the Boondocks is a level of quality rarely seen in animated adult television and is a shining beacon among the murky sea of adult swim's shows.",4,I &lt;3 The Boondocks,1334188800,"04 12, 2012",2012,1166,"['Aaron', 'McGruder', 'failed', 'impress', 'sunday', 'comic', 'watching', 'show', 'back', ""'05"", 'adult', 'swim', 'became', 'apparent', 'Boondocks', ""n't"", 'good', 'match', 'politically', 'correct/bland', 'sunday', 'comics', 'MA', 'rated', 'show', 'material', 'naturally', 'ease.People', 'saying', 'season', '3', 'decline', 'are', 'either', 'A', 'Hipsters', 'B', 'Stupid', 'animation', 'noticeably', 'increased', 'episodes', 'are', 'best', 'yet', 'Red', 'Ball', 'example', 'how', 'boondocks', 'mix', 'humor', 'kung', 'fu', 'homages', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'getting', 'ripped', 'new', 'one', 'Pause', 'Fried', 'Chicken', 'Flu', 'just', 'cracking', 'up', 'time', 'Boondocks', 'are', 'prime', 'However', 'season', 'Aaron', 'McGruder', 'few', 'BET', 'episodes', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'maybe', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'involved', 'tv', 'business', 'get', 'think', 'made', 'point', 'pretty', 'clear', 'BET', 'move', 'Rylo', 'Goodlove', 'think', 'also', 'pretty', 'boring', 'character', 'afromentioned', 'points', 'Boondocks', 'level', 'quality', 'rarely', 'seen', 'animated', 'adult', 'television', 'shining', 'beacon', 'murky', 'sea', 'adult', 'swim', 'shows']",The Boondocks: Season 3

Both the episodes ""The Red Ball"" "" The Fund Raiser"" and ""It's Going Down"" drive this fact home, even in episodes with little to no action like ""Story Of Jimmy Rebel""( parody of actual racist singer Johnny Rebel ) looks amazing in both high definition and stanrd tv formats.The writing for this season also went up as well as besides the already mentioned parody of Jimmy Rebel the episode called ""Smokin' With Cigarettes"" is also based on a actual child who did steal his grandma's car and sadly beat her in a fast food restaurant( also was made even better with all the refs toHalloween [Blu-ray] ). I do think my fav episodes this season from a writer's view point has to be ""Lovely Ebony Brown"" and ""Color Ruckus""( made better thanks to the talents of Don ""DC"" Curry ).For the dvd itself it has a handfull of extras, both Cedric( Tom ) and Gary( Uncle Ruckus ) introduce and exit every episode and the banter they showed in the features for season 2 was nothing to the hilarity they pulled off here. Instead of Arron McGrudder on comentary for a select episodes it's been handed over to Cedric, Gary and John Witherspoon( Grandad ), while not as into the production side that Aron and co got into it's still great to hear their two cents on what they thought. Another bonus was getting Sueng Kim's sketches from the show as he started out from season 1 as a storyboarder to a full on producer for this season.While it would have been nice to get a blu ray release of this season I'll take what I can get and hope there will be a season 4",5,When a great show gets better,1290988800,"11 29, 2010",2010,1896,"['fan', 'comic', 'strip', 'show', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'moved', 'got', 'better', 'took', 'time', 'new', 'season', 'one', 'look', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'why', 'easily', 'one', 'not', 'THE', 'best', 'looking', 'animated', 'show', 'tv', 'go', 'back', 'look', 'episode', 'previous', 'season', 'prime', 'time', 'animated', 'show', 'episodes', 'Red', 'Ball', 'Fund', 'Raiser', 'Going', 'Down', 'drive', 'fact', 'home', 'even', 'episodes', 'little', 'action', 'Story', 'Jimmy', 'Rebel', 'parody', 'actual', 'racist', 'singer', 'Johnny', 'Rebel', 'amazing', 'high', 'definition', 'stanrd', 'tv', 'formats.The', 'writing', 'season', 'also', 'went', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'already', 'mentioned', 'parody', 'Jimmy', 'Rebel', 'episode', 'called', 'Smokin', 'Cigarettes', 'also', 'based', 'actual', 'child', 'who', 'did', 'steal', 'grandma', 'car', 'sadly', 'beat', 'fast', 'food', 'restaurant', 'also', 'was', 'made', 'even', 'better', 'refs', 'toHalloween', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'do', 'think', 'fav', 'season', 'writer', 'view', 'point', 'be', 'Lovely', 'Ebony', 'Brown', 'Color', 'Ruckus', 'made', 'better', 'thanks', 'talents', 'Don', 'DC', 'Curry', '.For', 'dvd', 'handfull', 'extras', 'Cedric', 'Tom', 'Gary', 'Uncle', 'Ruckus', 'introduce', 'exit', 'episode', 'banter', 'showed', 'features', 'season', '2', 'was', 'nothing', 'hilarity', 'pulled', 'off', 'here', 'Instead', 'Arron', 'McGrudder', 'comentary', 'select', 'been', 'handed', 'Cedric', 'Gary', 'John', 'Witherspoon', 'Grandad', 'not', 'production', 'side', 'Aron', 'co', 'got', 'still', 'great', 'hear', 'two', 'cents', 'what', 'thought', 'bonus', 'was', 'getting', 'Sueng', 'Kim', 'sketches', 'show', 'started', 'out', 'season', '1', 'storyboarder', 'full', 'producer', 'season.While', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'get', 'blu', 'ray', 'release', 'season', ""'ll"", 'take', 'what', 'can', 'get', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'season', '4']",The Boondocks: Season 3
