1526326,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0074JOCTU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","In the realm of perfectly pleasant, but relatively unremarkable, made-for-TV movies, this Hallmark Movie Channel original serves up exactly what you might anticipate. After the ratings success of 2011's ""Goodnight for Justice"" (which reunited 90210 pals Jason Priestly as the director and Luke Perry as the star), this folksy sequel follows frontier judge John Goodnight to a new post in the unspecified Western Territories. ""The Measure of A Man"" sticks pretty true to its non-threatening TV formula with gentle action, chaste romance, and lessons on tolerance and responsibility. But I suspect the core audience for which this film was intended wouldn't have it any other way. Heck, this isn't HBO's ""Deadwood!"" As such, the movie is mildly engaging. However, while I enjoyed it enough on its own terms, I don't know that I'd be rushing out to make a DVD purchase. My recommendation: check it out for free on the Hallmark Channel before deciding you want to own it.Within minutes of arriving in his new township, Perry makes cute with a local lass (Stefanie von Pfetten) only to discover that she is a long lost love that he hasn't seen for over 15 years. What a stroke of luck! But this enormous coincidence is just the first in a series of increasingly unlikely occurrences which drive the plot. A ruthless gang of bandits soon blows into town to rob the bank and cause general mayhem, and one is caught alive. Wouldn't you know it? It just so happens to be von Pfetten's estranged son (Cameron Bright). Between dissing unscrupulous lawyers and single handedly acting as the town's voice of reason (let's just say there are lots of scenes with disgruntled townsfolk mumbling their displeasure), can Perry salvage the young outlaw's soul? And what about disbanding the vicious criminal horde? It might just be time for some frontier justice served up cold by laconic hero John Goodnight!Through it all, the movie's greatest asset is a weathered and comfortable Luke Perry. It's easy to like Perry and he gets you through the screenplay's more outrageous moments. I particularly loved the courtroom scenes as they are written with modern day politically correct care as opposed to feeling remotely genuine. There is a decent enough story behind the villain and his band of followers, but it isn't explored in much detail. I suppose that makes it easier to cue a tidy ending, but I really think a dynamic film might be made from the villain's perspective. That story, however, would be better served with a bit more grit on another network. If you like TV westerns or Luke Perry, this is easy enough to watch. I'm just not sure how many times you'd pull it out for repeat viewing, so that's why I recommend catching it on the network before investing in a DVD purchase.

We get the idea he is a womanizer who likes his drink, but as a Hallmark film, it doesn't dwell on the topic. He runs an unusual court and doesn't like it when people have legal representation. He tries the cases himself. He runs into an old girlfriend Callie(Baroness Stephanie von Pfetten), who was a stage actress he knew in Chicago.When the bad guys come to town to rob the bank, a man is killed. One of the bank robbers is captured...who happens to be Will, the son of Callie. The town wants to hang Will (Cameron Bright, Alec-Twilight saga). John, in spite of his past relationship to Callie does not recluse himself, but finds a way to save the boy and his mother from an angry vigilante mob who demands a hanging.The film is hokey and cheesy as any Hallmark. People can't seem to shoot and hit anything, even at close range. Many movie cliches. I will say in spite of all the shortcomings it somewhat held my interest.

When Goodnight uses the boy to find the head of the gang more secrets are revealed. After watching the first movie and actually thinking it wasn't that cheesy I went in expecting the same from this one. I was wrong. I realize that this one was also on the Hallmark Channel and I should have expected it but this was way cheesier then the first movie.

1526332,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B0074JOCTU,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[1, 2]","In a long interview, Luke Perry (the creator and executive producer of the ""Goodnight"" films) says he doesn't want to make Westerns that overwhelm the viewer with action. He's more interested in drama, and (particularly) where he can take the character. (We see at the beginning that Goodnight still drinks to excess, but nothing much is made of this in the rest of the film.)""The Measure of a Man"" is arguably better than the first film, as it focuses on one story, and does so efficiently and without unneeded padding. It is similarly low-key and reserved, and likewise has a Really Nasty villain. Not surprisingly, Goodnight tosses his guns aside and defeats the villain in a fistfight, rather than gunning him down.I cannot praise the cinematography enough. ""The Measure of a Man"" is one of the best-photographed color films I have ever seen, including any theatrical film. It's gorgeous, and perhaps worth seeing for that reason alone. The photography justifies a Blu-ray transfer, though I doubt we'll ever see one.If Mr Perry wants to keep making these films, I'm game to keep watching them.
