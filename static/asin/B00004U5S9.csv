It's a rather unique fetish, but Jubei does it well: you get to see the shy, funny expressions on the faces of the girls as they're asked to kick, and the camera angles (including those all-important ""low angle"" shots). It's great to see these shy, laughing girls try to overcome their inhibitions and kick out with all their might. A great item for fans of the ball-kicking fetish known as ""tamakeri.""",5,A Ninja Girl Kick!,1044748800,"02 9, 2003",2003,586,"['anime', 'seven', 'pretty', 'Japanese', 'girls', 'are', 'invited', 'Magic', 'Mirror', 'Bus', 'go-anywhere', 'anime', 'studio', 'operated', 'Jubei', 'kick', 'crotch', 'area', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'characters', 'rather', 'unique', 'fetish', 'Jubei', 'well', 'get', 'see', 'shy', 'funny', 'expressions', 'girls', ""'re"", 'asked', 'kick', 'camera', 'angles', 'including', 'all-important', 'low', 'angle', 'shots', 'great', 'see', 'shy', 'laughing', 'girls', 'try', 'overcome', 'inhibitions', 'kick', 'out', 'might', 'great', 'item', 'fans', 'ball-kicking', 'fetish', 'known', 'tamakeri']",Jubei-Chan the Ninja Girl - Vol. 1: The Secret of the Lovely Eyepatch - A Legend Reborn

Voices (subbed version) are exellent!  This anime goes from humor to drama to action and back again in 5 minutes, it's amazing.Content wise there's nothing wrong with this anime aside from a couple boob jokes.  No nudity, profanity, or blood.the storyline is relatively compelling, but not super.  The episodes seem to center more on entertaining the viewer than progressing the storyline.The dubbed version is even good with the exception of Jubei's voice.  She's supposed to be like 14 or 15 years old and her English dub over voice make her seem like she's 25 or so.On a final note, the DVD menu for scene selection is the most organized I've seen, some dvd's put a very poor effort into this aspect of their product, resulting it it being hard to figure out where you need to start playing at.  Say if you stopped at episode 2, then the next day went back to watch the rest, it was very easy to find your place.  If anyone has ever tried to use scene selection on the DVD of Angel Sanctuary, you know what I mean.Report CardAnimation: ACharacters: A+Storyline: B+Voices(sub): A+Voices(dub): B--------------Overall: A",5,Adorable!,1012953600,"02 6, 2002",2002,1212,"['**screams', 'little', 'girl**i', 'hilarious', 'Most', 'silly', 'animation', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Voices', 'subbed', 'version', 'are', 'exellent', 'anime', 'humor', 'drama', 'action', 'back', 'again', '5', 'minutes', 'amazing.Content', 'wise', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'anime', 'aside', 'couple', 'boob', 'jokes', 'nudity', 'profanity', 'blood.the', 'storyline', 'relatively', 'compelling', 'not', 'super', 'episodes', 'seem', 'center', 'more', 'entertaining', 'viewer', 'progressing', 'storyline.The', 'dubbed', 'version', 'even', 'good', 'exception', 'Jubei', 'voice', 'supposed', 'be', '14', '15', 'years', 'old', 'English', 'dub', 'voice', 'make', 'seem', '25', 'so.On', 'final', 'note', 'DVD', 'menu', 'scene', 'selection', 'most', 'organized', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dvd', 'put', 'very', 'poor', 'effort', 'aspect', 'product', 'resulting', 'being', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'need', 'start', 'playing', 'Say', 'stopped', 'episode', '2', 'then', 'next', 'day', 'went', 'back', 'watch', 'rest', 'was', 'very', 'easy', 'find', 'place', 'anyone', 'ever', 'tried', 'use', 'scene', 'selection', 'DVD', 'Angel', 'Sanctuary', 'know', 'what', 'mean.Report', 'CardAnimation', 'ACharacters', 'A+Storyline', 'B+Voices', 'sub', 'A+Voices', 'dub', 'B', 'Overall', 'A']",Jubei-Chan the Ninja Girl - Vol. 1: The Secret of the Lovely Eyepatch - A Legend Reborn

I am glad I did. The 13 episode seris all starts with this volume. If you don't watch this one you will have no Earthly idea what is happening in the rest of the seris.300 years ago the great swordsmen Yagu Jubei lost his life in the desprate fight against the Ryojoji Shinkagario. Before he died Jubei told his trusted friend Koinosuke Odago to find his succesor. When Koinosuke asks Lord Jubei how he will know the individual that will carry out his sword, he answers ""A big pair of bouncy bon-bons"" (sub version).Just prior to Jubei dieing he hands Koinosuke an eye patch, in the shape of a heart. He said that the pupil who wears the Lovely Eyepatch would aqurire his skills.Then Jubei dies. For the next 300 years, surviving on his spirit alone, Koinosuke Odago takes up the quest to find the succsesor of Yagu Jubei.Then you meet Jiyu ""Jubei"" Nanohana, a 14 (?) year old 8th student who just moved to a new town. Along with the struggles of being a new student in a middle school, Jiyu has attracted the attention of 2 middle school boys, Shiro, and Bantaro (AKA Ban.When Jiyu gets lost on her way home from school, she runs into Koinosuke. Koinosuke dose his best to convice Jiyu to behold the Lovely Eye Patch. Jiyu, being a normal teenager refuses to listen to Koinosuke. But when a new evil force appears and attacks Sai Nanohana (jiyu's dad), as if on cue Koinosuke appears, and puts the Lovely Eyepatch on Jiyu. Then Jiyu transforms into the great warrior Yagu Jebei The Second. After defeateing her first new enemy, Jiyu refuses to yeild the eyepatch.How will Koinosuke convince a pluky, loudmouthed, smart alleck teenager that she is the savior of the world? And will Jiyu listen the what Koinosuke was to say? Watch this and you will find outIf you are a fan of Sailormoon, then you will more than likely enjoy this. It has the magical girl plot. The reason that I only gave it 4 stars is because, a little too much time is spent on the DVD with Shiro and Ban fawnning over Jiyu. After a while that starts to get a little boring.

551878,A2Y1D9287MGNQ4,B00004U5S9,Steven Myers,"[13, 14]","Jubei-chan is about as absurd as anything you would want to see.  It's  also undeniably funny, but certainly not for everyone.  Poor 13 year-old  Jiyu, as the unwilling heir to the greatest swordsman of all time, is  threatened by the grudge of that swordsman's enemies.  Poor Koinusuke, the  swordsman's servant who has wandered the earth for 300 years looking for  Jiyu, only to find she keeps throwing away the heart-shaped eyepatch which  grants her skill with the sword.  But note: that's the least of the  silliness.  Basically every guy who sees Jiyu, from the other students to  her teachers, takes one look at her chest and falls in love with her.  This  is even more peculiar, because that chest is always safely hidden away  beneath a school uniform shirt and sweater, and--at least by anime  conventions--it's not especially out of proportion.  There's no nudity  worries here, at least in this first disc.  Jubei-chan is certainly much  less lewd than the average American sitcom (basically, the boys think about  Jiyu and picture her still-in-sweater chest).This show is NOT a drama,  at least not in this first disc: it is a comedy which has some very nicely  done fighting sequences in it.  While some conventional elements of a drama  are present, they are deliberately absurd--you aren't supposed to take  Jiyu's predicament seriously.  The characters, not any sense of drama, make  this work: some of the best scenes are between Koinusuke and Jiyu's father,  who repeatedly tries and fails to understand why a samurai is now living in  his house as his daughter's servant.  If you can deal with the frequent  references to Jiyu's chest, you will laugh a lot while watching this disc.",5,Hilarious and absurd,968371200,"09 8, 2000",2000,1702,"['Jubei-chan', 'as', 'absurd', 'anything', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'also', 'undeniably', 'funny', 'certainly', 'not', 'everyone', 'Poor', '13', 'year-old', 'Jiyu', 'unwilling', 'heir', 'greatest', 'swordsman', 'time', 'threatened', 'grudge', 'swordsman', 'enemies', 'Poor', 'Koinusuke', 'swordsman', 'servant', 'who', 'wandered', 'earth', '300', 'years', 'looking', 'Jiyu', 'only', 'find', 'throwing', 'away', 'heart-shaped', 'eyepatch', 'skill', 'sword', 'note', 'least', 'silliness', 'Basically', 'guy', 'who', 'Jiyu', 'other', 'students', 'teachers', 'one', 'look', 'chest', 'love', 'even', 'more', 'peculiar', 'chest', 'always', 'safely', 'hidden', 'away', 'school', 'uniform', 'shirt', 'sweater', 'least', 'anime', 'conventions', 'not', 'especially', 'proportion', 'nudity', 'here', 'least', 'first', 'disc', 'Jubei-chan', 'certainly', 'much', 'less', 'lewd', 'average', 'American', 'sitcom', 'basically', 'boys', 'think', 'Jiyu', 'picture', 'still-in-sweater', 'chest', '.This', 'show', 'NOT', 'drama', 'least', 'not', 'first', 'disc', 'comedy', 'very', 'nicely', 'done', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'conventional', 'elements', 'drama', 'are', 'present', 'are', 'deliberately', 'absurd', 'are', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'take', 'Jiyu', 'predicament', 'seriously', 'characters', 'not', 'sense', 'drama', 'make', 'work', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'Koinusuke', 'Jiyu', 'father', 'who', 'repeatedly', 'understand', 'why', 'samurai', 'now', 'living', 'house', 'daughter', 'servant', 'can', 'deal', 'frequent', 'references', 'Jiyu', 'chest', 'will', 'laugh', 'lot', 'watching', 'disc']",Jubei-Chan the Ninja Girl - Vol. 1: The Secret of the Lovely Eyepatch - A Legend Reborn
