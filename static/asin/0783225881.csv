Well,  that has never sat comfortably with me and it is this feeling that  &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; addresses. We watch spellbound as one act on  the part of an Iowa Farmer, brings about positive changes in a great many  lives. What at first seems a crazy act, blossoms into a miracle, as the  full scope of the plan becomes apparent.This movie speaks to many  parts of the human heart but the common theme is redemption. Most of us  have regrets, some big, some small. But all we can  usually do is dream  about the world of &quot;what if&quot;. When Ray Kinsella, (Costner),  starts to hear voices, &quot;what if&quot; starts to become very real  indeed. Psychiatrists would not hesitate to diagnose a farmer, who hears  voices and then plows his corn crop under to build a baseball diamond, as  schizoid. But Ray has more faith than most doctors, and his wife, Anni,  supports him all the way.Despite the financial problems of the  farm, Ray listens to the voice and takes off on a road trip. He aims to  find Terrence Mann, (James Earl Jones), a famous writer from the 60's who  has dropped out of the public eye. Interestingly, the voice never told him  to do this. It tends to be very general about things, saying &quot;If you  build it, he will come&quot; or &quot;Go the distance&quot;. But Ray  becomes adept at reading the signs and interpreting the  specifics.As he travels across the country, Ray picks up  partners. And in the end he manages to participate in several  transformation which are much more remarkable than a cornfield turning into  a ballpark. A burned-out writer gets  an injection of passion. A small town  doctor gets to play out a lost opportunity. A disgraced ball player is able  to pick up the bat one more time. Ray is finally able to forgive and  apologize to his father, and his family farm gets a new lease on life.It's true that &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; is a feel good film with a  happy ending but it's more than the standard Hollywood treacle. Powerful  themes are woven amongst some very real characters. Themes like faith,  trust, perseverance, selflessness and hope. Of course it also says a lot  about baseball, which is not surprising given that Kevin Costner is the  star. You walk away from this movie believing in miracles and suspecting  that God may know what he's doing after all, at least when he's not busy  playing ball down in Iowa.",4,Listen to your inner voice.,966211200,"08 14, 2000",2000,2535,"['Most', 'time', ""'re"", 'told', 'God', 'mysterious', 'ways', 'grand', 'plan', 'too', 'complex', 'one', 'person', 'understand', 'Well', 'never', 'sat', 'comfortably', 'feeling', 'quot', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'quot', 'addresses', 'watch', 'spellbound', 'one', 'act', 'part', 'Iowa', 'Farmer', 'positive', 'changes', 'great', 'many', 'lives', 'What', 'first', 'crazy', 'act', 'blossoms', 'miracle', 'full', 'scope', 'plan', 'apparent.This', 'movie', 'speaks', 'many', 'parts', 'human', 'heart', 'common', 'theme', 'redemption', 'Most', 'have', 'regrets', 'big', 'small', 'can', 'usually', 'do', 'dream', 'world', 'quot', 'what', 'quot', 'When', 'Ray', 'Kinsella', 'Costner', 'hear', 'voices', 'quot', 'what', 'quot', 'become', 'very', 'real', 'indeed', 'Psychiatrists', 'would', 'not', 'hesitate', 'diagnose', 'farmer', 'who', 'voices', 'then', 'corn', 'crop', 'build', 'baseball', 'diamond', 'schizoid', 'Ray', 'more', 'faith', 'most', 'doctors', 'wife', 'Anni', 'way.Despite', 'financial', 'problems', 'farm', 'Ray', 'voice', 'off', 'road', 'trip', 'find', 'Terrence', 'Mann', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'famous', 'writer', '60', 'who', 'dropped', 'public', 'eye', 'Interestingly', 'voice', 'never', 'told', 'do', 'be', 'very', 'general', 'things', 'saying', 'quot', 'build', 'will', 'come', 'quot', 'quot', 'Go', 'distance', 'quot', 'Ray', 'adept', 'reading', 'signs', 'interpreting', 'specifics.As', 'country', 'Ray', 'up', 'partners', 'end', 'participate', 'several', 'transformation', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'remarkable', 'cornfield', 'turning', 'ballpark', 'burned-out', 'writer', 'injection', 'passion', 'small', 'town', 'doctor', 'play', 'out', 'lost', 'opportunity', 'disgraced', 'ball', 'player', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'bat', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'Ray', 'finally', 'able', 'forgive', 'apologize', 'father', 'family', 'farm', 'new', 'lease', 'life.It', 'true', 'quot', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'quot', 'feel', 'good', 'film', 'happy', 'ending', 'more', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'treacle', 'Powerful', 'themes', 'are', 'woven', 'very', 'real', 'characters', 'Themes', 'faith', 'trust', 'perseverance', 'selflessness', 'hope', 'course', 'also', 'lot', 'baseball', 'not', 'surprising', 'given', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'star', 'walk', 'away', 'movie', 'believing', 'miracles', 'suspecting', 'God', 'may', 'know', 'what', 'doing', 'least', 'when', 'not', 'busy', 'playing', 'down', 'Iowa']",N/A

Why?Because it brought in a whole new perspective on baseball,with a lot of care, blended in a story that touches us all---whether we ever picked up a glove or ""had a catch"" in our life.That is the story of a man who drew away from his father, further and further, and never had a chance to reconcile before dad died.  In this movie, he gets another chance, and in our lives, each of us, we all get another chance to start again, and remember, and follow our dreams.My wife Chris and I live in the farthest north city in the U.S. ---Barrow, Alaska, and virtually every summer we travel over 3000 miles to go to Dyersville, Iowa, to the great town it is---and also out to the field.

As a man, I'm forced to admit its one of the few over which I've ever shed a tear (and yeah, continue to do so, every time I watch it).Its odd too, because I don't buy the ""baseball is magic"" concept.  Rather than being the ""only consistent thing in America,"" in my opinion, Baseball has accurately reflected America's ugly, selfish, and win at any cost philosophy.  Today, the sport (at least at the major league level, which is the focus of the movie) is in caos.  The owners only care about making money. They got rid of the Commissioner, the players spit at umpires, they're all taking illegal drugs, and the sport is promoting a steriod user as he tarnishes one of its most cherished records (Barry Bonds).  At its highest levels, the sport is tainted.  Even one of the main baseball characters in the movie, ""Shoeless Joe Jackson,"" was involved in one of th more famous betting scandals!For me, the move is better than baseball.  Its about the father-son relationship, the persuit of life's goals, accepting the reality of our own limitations, and making a success out of life by doing the best we can.  Perhaps its also about listening to and following that little voice in the back of our heads, we most often ignore.When the Burt Lancaster character steps over the line and away from his dream (once again), to save the little girl from choking, it reminds me of my own father (who was a physician, and is now deceased), and I lose it.Wow.

Director Phil Alden Robinson turns in a Frank Capra-esque performance with his brilliant adaptation of W.P. Kinsella's book Shoeless Joe. A rare, family-friendly movie that will captivate and inspire adults both young and old, Field of Dreams is a must-see film for any lover of life.The story begins with a narration by Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) of his life up this point - his father's love of baseball (especially ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson), his estrangement from his father at a young age, the upheaval of the 1960s, and finally, Ray's love affair with his wife Annie (Amy Madigan). In their mid-thirties, the couple takes a bold step when they purchase an Iowa farm and settle down with their daughter Karin.In the opening scene, one of the most famous movie lines in history is hoist upon the audience. While Ray tends to his cornfield, he hears a mysterious voice whisper, ""If you build it, he will come..."" Realizing that he is the only one who hears the voice, Ray struggles with the idea that he is going crazy. That is, until one night when he looks out his bedroom window and envisions a baseball field in his backyard. Believing that if he builds the baseball field, ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta) will come to play upon its surface, Ray acquires the blessing of his wife and sets out to make his dream a reality.Plowing up his cornfield and building a full-size baseball diamond, the whole town thinks Ray has gone nuts. After an uneventful year passes by, Ray begins to believe them. He and Annie are struggling to keep themselves together financially when Karin points out that a man is standing on her daddy's baseball field. Ray turns on the lights and goes outside to greet him. The man he meets is ""Shoeless"" Joe. Immediately, Annie and Ray agree that they will keep the field at all costs. ""Shoeless"" Joe brings other ex-ballplayers out of the mysterious corn to practice and throw the ball around, when Ray hears the voice yet again... ""Go the distance,"" it says.Pondering the intent of this latest voice, Ray determines that he must go to Boston to meet with Terence Mann (James Earl Jones), an influent 1960's writer whose books are being considered for a ban by the local school board. Winning over the reclusive writer, Ray and Terence travel to Minnesota to find Archibald ""Moonlight"" Graham (Burt Lancaster) whose name they saw emblazoned in the scoreboard lights at Fenway. When a young Archie appears by the roadside to join them on their return trip to the corn-carved ball field, truly magical things begin to take place.Karin's life is saved by a ghost thankful for his chance to live out his long lost dream, and the farm is saved from foreclosure when Ray's brother-in-law Mark finally realizes the true value of the baseball field and thousands of visitors are drawn to its magic from parts unknown.

54111,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,0783225881,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 2]","Somehow, a movie about a baseball field being built in a cornfield and that the edge of it actually is the gateway back to Heaven for ghosts doesn't really sound schmaltzy and that's probably the reason why the film was such a hit and why people, upon hearing of the film, go ""oh yeah that movie, I loved that!"". Course some don't like it but it's remarkable how little detractors I find. It's hard to say whether it's one of those American classics on line with Godfather and E.T and whatnot but as it stands, it's quite a great movie that never seems to get old which surprised me quite a bit.Ray Kinsella is a farmer in Iowa raising a corn farm with his wife and daughter. While outside, he hears a strange voice: ""if you build it, he will come"". He hears it so many times that but he has no clue what it means until it dawns on him: build a baseball field and maybe baseball great late ""Shoeless Joe"" Jackson will come back to play baseball. With a supporting wife (she actually condones building a baseball field and never gets mad? Where can I find me someone like her?) but with financial concerns as well as local gossip, he builds it and sure enough, Shoeless Joe as well as other ballplayers show up to play. There's more to it than that and he'll get a chance to reconnect some people's problems as well as his own.Despite the fact that it made quite a bit of money, it's actually not a very elaborate looking movie. Instead it's all the characters and the story and the film never seems to drag which is quite something since it's essentially a film about baseball. The film's iconic line ""if you build it, he will come"" is still in my head since when I was younger and it's just as cool now as it was then. It's also a film where you really have to suspend disbelief in huge chunks. The idea of a baseball field bringing the dead back to life is quite something but we never seem to feel like ""oh good lord, now what?""As far as acting is concerned, it's nearly perfect. Kevin Costner has often been ridiculed, moreso for Waterworld and the Postman than his acting and granted he's not the most depthful actor, he's at least very likable as the everyman here. James Earl Jones is quite perfect, making his baseball speech heartfelt and uplifting without having this kind of pandering. Same for Burt Lancaster who just exudes this kind of calm like you almost couldn't get in a fight with the guy he was so nice. The others are either pretty good like Ray's wife but then we have the wife's brother Mark who's kind of more annoying than villainous.Around this time, Costner was kind of on a roll. His turns in JFK, Bull Durham and Academy Award winner Dances With Wolves was big and in the same group is this film which is still a delight...even though personally, I'm a bigger hockey fan.

A few years back when life wasn't as easy as I would like it to be  I harkened back in my mind the times spent with my Dad as a youngster seeing the Phillies at old Veterans Stadium.  Now my Dad soured on the game viewing the game rife with greedy owners and overpriced prima donna players and refused to go to the games anymore.  I didn't press my Dad on the issue but at this particular moment I really wanted to go the game with him.  I badgered him incessantly and finally he relented.  I has visions of sugar plums dancing in my head with me and Dad sharing a Kodak moment sipping beers and munching dogs and watching the Phils triumph.  It didn't necessary happen that way and the Phils lost to the old Montreal Expos but that's OK.  The thing about ""Field of Dreams"" it views baseball as the great equalizer.  The disgraced Joe Jackson shares the same field as Walter Johnson as well as ""Moonlight Graham"", a player whose distinction was that he only took the field for one-half inning and never played major league ball again.  On my cubicle at work Jimmy Rollins and Ryan Howard live beside the greatest Phillie of them all, Richie Ashburn.  If you thought Mike Schmidt was the greatest Phillie of them all you're not from Philadelphia.

Not only in its purest form is it the greatest game ever invented, it is also the only game that completely and thoroughly transcends and binds our country to past, present, and future--generation to generation.Director Phil Alden Robinson's FIELD OF DREAMS pays homage to baseball's majestic, magical link to nostalgia.  When a struggling Iowa farmer, Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) begins &quot;hearing voices&quot; and subsequently plows under his cornfield and builds a baseball diamond, he becomes a pariah to his community--to his family.  But Ray knows he's tapped into a special level of consiousness:  a beautiful, soothing karma that slowly but wonderfully manifests itself throughout this incredible film.  The baseball field itself becomes a portal to another world, enabling players from baseball's Golden Age to return.  To play baseball.  As the film draws to its dramatic, moving ending, Ray surveys his field of dreams and remarks, &quot;This is perfect.&quot;And it is.Kevin Costner turns in his finest performance.  Ray Liotta, Amy Madigan, Timothy Busfield, and the great Burt Lancaster are exceptional.  But it is James Earl Jones, who plays disgruntled author Terrence Mann and eventual soul mate to Kinsella, who is the catalyst that takes this film to a higher level.

54131,A35J4XGRWXVZ00,0783225881,Edward,"[2, 28]","Not so long ago Ben Mankiewicz, scion of the screenwriting/producing/directing family, told a great story on television: the first time he saw the 1989 &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; he was bawling in the movie theatre, that's how impressed he was. Ben's relationship with his father (Joseph's nephew) had always been close, and a great deal of their bonding had been associated with baseball. They had been going to games together since Ben was a kid. Therefore, as soon as Ben left the theatre, he called his father and gushed: &quot;Dad, I've just seen 'Field of Dreams'!&quot; Before he could go any further, the elder man growled: &quot;Wasn't that the dumbest piece of crap you ever saw?&quot; Poor Ben doesn't seem like a wimp, but he was so crushed by his father's reaction he had no choice but to agree. Having finally seen this fanatically idolized movie I can only say: &quot;Bravo, Mankiewicz p&egrave;re!&quot; This is beer-sappy bilge, the type of thing Homer Simpson would sob over at Moe's. I can't imagine a baseball fan enjoying this movie, any more than I can imagine anyone who really likes children sitting through a program with that obnoxious dinosaur. Written and directed with sledge-hammer simplicity by Phil Alden Robinson (who hasn't done much since), &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; is the story of Ray Kinsella, an Iowa farmer by way of Berkeley who, one afternoon in his cornfield, hears a voice: &quot;If you build it, he will come.&quot; That's it, but Kinsella decides &quot;it&quot; is a baseball field, so he plows under his corn and constructs a diamond, complete with lights. Kinsella's convinced the &quot;he&quot; of the cryptic message is none other than Shoeless Joe Jackson, the player who, with seven of his team mates, was indicted in the 1919 Black Sox Scandal; but Kinsella is further convinced that Jackson was railroaded, an honest man who made a mistake. (Actually, Robinson's screenplay implies that Jackson was completely innocent -- citing his batting average as proof!) Kevin Costner had already established himself as a star of Cooperesque sincerity. Unfortunately, he got the goofy charm down pat but not the rugged individualism. Amy Madigan, as Kinsella's wife, is more difficult to judge. I think her character was meant to be a hybrid of Berkeley liberalism and mid-West spunk, but what comes across is somewhat shallow. (Following &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;, Ms Madigan did a great deal of TV.)That patriarchal character actor James Earl Jones wastes his sepulchral voice on some pretty contrived dialogue; and, even sadder, Burt Lancaster makes one of his last screen appearances in an awkward scene involving a little girl's very unconvincing crisis. Robinson and Costner, before committing themselves to a baseball fantasy about a man fighting pragmatic odds, should have studied Clarence Brown's light but spiky &quot;Angels in the Outfield&quot;.

For sheer originality and creativity, the film is an easy 5-stars. The movie keeps you guessing and never fails to surprise.

You cry at the end because you are happy for Costner's character for having this supernatural chance to meet again with his father and ""have a catch"". They, beyond the grave, reconcile differences they had in life. The plot is fantasy at its best, very far-fetched, but with an excellent cast, which makes the story engaging and heartfelt. It is one of the few movies in which I have enjoyed Costner's performance and found him warm and likeable. Although at first his pairing with Amy Madigan as his wife seemed a bit strange, I came to appreciate their functioning as a family unit. Madigan and Costner are passable as 60s liberal leftovers who try to make a life as farmers in Iowa, but somehow are missing some magic that leads Costner into a quest for himself (midlife crisis, you could say) that makes him hear voices and obey their commands. James Earl Jones is excellent as Terrence Mann,  and it was nice to see Burt Lancaster play the small but pleasant role of Archibald ""Moonlight"" Graham. Ray Liotta was actually also a joy to watch as Shoeless Joe Jackson.

(At least it doesn't just milk that magic the way &quot;The Natural&quot; did -- that was a beautiful movie, but a total mess otherwise.) Perhaps you had to play baseball as a kid to have this sort of nostalgic feel for the game (for me it's tied up with memories of magic hour at the end of long summer afternoons and trying to play one more inning before nightfall), and while I think that the movie uses those feelings honestly and fairly, it doesn't (to me) seem to be able to recreate (or even explain) them to someone that doesn't feel this way about baseball.It's a very pretty movie, and it does a great job of giving the authentic feel of an idealized midwestern summer.

The movie it self is just magical in every sense of the word. It's a moving story told in a way that might surprise you( you will never look at corn the same way again). And their is a speech about Baseball, by James Earl Jones, that only he could have done. The movie also has Burt Lancaster's last proformance.

It's become one of a handful of American films like ""Wizard of Oz"" and ""Casablanca"" that I can watch over and over again. It's always thoroughly satisfying and I often find something new to appreciate with each new viewing.The cast is outstanding. Kevin Costner has never been more charming as Ray Kinsella, approaching middle age and searching for something in his life. Amy Madigan is delightful as his spunky wife and Gaby Hoffmann is adorable as their little girl. Timothy Busfield is appropriately annoying as the doubting, argumentative brother-in-law and James Earl Jones is outstanding as the former `60s radical who gets wound up in Ray's mad scheme. Ray Liotta as Shoeless Joe Jackson, Frank Whaley as the young Archie Graham, and Burt Lancaster as the elderly Doc ""Moonlight"" Graham are pitch-perfect.The script, which won Phil Alden Robinson the Oscar for Original Screenplay that year, is so sharp. It's a mystery, a fantasy, a family drama, a baseball movie, a road movie, a meditation on fathers and sons, generational change, America. The way he weaves the strands of different stories together with Ray's central quest is awesome. And the number of memorable lines in this film rivals the classics I mentioned earlier. ""Build it and he will come."" ""Is this heaven?"" ""No, it's Iowa."" ""People will come, Ray.

Maybe we said or did something stupid or cruel in a moment of passion, and left an eternal scar on someone we love, someone who loved us.  Life rarely if ever gives us a second chance.  In the words of Moonlight Graham (Burt Lancaster), an old small-town doctor who, fifty years before, got to play in the major leagues for just one inning, ""...we just don't recognize the most significant moments of our lives when they're happening.  I said to myself, `There'll be other days,' but it turned out that that was the only day.""The ""dream"" of this beautiful film, is the dream of the second chance.  This theme is common to all the major characters, and by some inexplicable miracle the film pulls it off without ever becoming sappy.  There are a few tiny flaws I could point out, but why?  The film as a whole is such a towering achievement of the metaphysical, of the magical, of the spiritual, that if you are willing to suspend your disbelief even the tiniest little bit, it will take you to places in your soul that you didn't even know were there.  In a strange and almost perfect way, ""Field of Dreams"" taps into that deepest and most precious place in the Judeo/Christian cultural tradition - that place where forgiveness and redemption live, and where that which is beautiful and good does not die or disappear, but instead lives forever.

54161,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,0783225881,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[3, 4]","Five stars is not enough for this movie.  It is absolutely excellent.  The film is about baseball, but also the love of family and believing in your dreams.  Kevin Costner gives a stirring performance as Ray Kinsella, an Iowa farmer whose love for the game of baseball changes his life forever.  Amy Madigan plays Costner's supportive wife.  One day while working in his field, Ray hears a &quot;voice&quot; tell him &quot;If you build it, he will come&quot;.  Brushing this off, Ray lets the episode pass.  However, he continually hears the voice, and finally has a vision of a baseball field in his cornfield.  Ray remembers that Shoeless Joe Jackson was his father's hero and one of the infamous 1919 &quot;Black Sox&quot; who threw the World Series.  Jackson, however, didn't alter his play during the series and wound up hitting well over .300.  Meanwhile, Ray figures out what the voice was telling him; build a baseball field and Joe Jackson will come back.  Ray plows under his corn and builds a magnificent baseball field on his own property.  Finally, Jackson makes his appearance.  Shortly thereafter, the voice speaks to Ray again.  This time, the voice says &quot;Ease his pain&quot;.  Coincidentally, Ray and his wife attend a schoolboard meeting that same night.  The parents are upset about some of the books that are being used in the local schools, some of which are written by 1960s leader Terrance Mann.  Ray makes the connection; ease Mann's pain.  So, he sets off for Boston to search out Mann. Mann, Played superbly by James Earl Jones, was a baseball fan and once gave an interview expressing his disappontment at the destruction of old Ebbetts Field in Brooklyn.  Ray and Terrance attend a Boston Red Sox game, and the voice speaks to Ray again.  This time it says &quot;Go the distance&quot;.  There is also a message about &quot;Moonlight&quot; Graham, a player who played only 1 inning of 1 game his entire career.  To Ray's surprise, Terrance also sees the message.  Now the two head to Minnesota to track down Graham.  Upon arriving, they discover Graham never played baseball again and became a local doctor. Ray steps out of his hotel room and is transported back to 1972, the year Graham died.  He finds Graham, played wonderfully by Burt Lancaster, walking down the street.  The two converse about Graham's playing days.  I was truly moved by Lancaster's portrayal of this character.  His conversation with Ray was excellent.  Ray asks &quot;Doc&quot; Graham to return with himself and Terrance to Iowa, but Doc declines.  However, later in their trip, Terrance and Ray pick up a young hitch-hiker, who announceds his name as Archie Graham!!  So he really did end up going with them after all, although he was much younger.  The group arrives back at Ray's farm in Iowa, and Archie happily joins the players on the field.  He told Ray that his one wish would have been to bat in the major leagues, for he only played the outfield in his one appearance.  He got his chance on Ray's field.  Terrance has a vision of his own.  He envisions people paying money to come and see Ray's wonderful &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;.  In the end, Terrance walks off the field and into the corn with the players, and Ray is left with a row of cars stretching for miles to see his field.I can't explain enough how wonderful this movie is.  The actors are top-notch, and the storyline is excellent.  My favorite line from the movie is when Joe asks Ray &quot;Is this Heaven?&quot; and Ray answers &quot;No, its Iowa&quot;.  The sense of family and going all out to accomplish your dreams is truly heartwarming. If you are a baseball fan, or if you just like good movies with morals and values, then this is the movie for you.

This is  exactly the type of affirming and upliftingly American story that Capra  would have filmed in his heyday with Gary Cooper in the Mr. Deeds/John Doe  &quot;Everyman&quot; role here played so effectively by Kevin Costner.  Costner is ably supported by Ray Liotta, Timothy Busfield and the great  James Earl Jones; there's also a touchingly effective performance by Burt  Lancaster, who masterfully creates a beautiful and complete  characterization in just a few short scenes.

Costner  portrays the &quot;everyman&quot; in America, just trying to do his best  for his family, and then the immortal words are spoken &quot;IF YOU BUILD  IT..HE WILL COME!&quot;  After that, a magical journey of nostalgia,  appreciation of others and love of the game are woven superbly into the  plot.  Amy Madigan portrays Costner's wife, and she is the type of woman in  the movie that any man would be considered lucky to have by his side.  Ray  Liotta as the immortal &quot;Shoeless&quot; Joe Jackson does the real  Jackson justice, and James Earl-Jones is a man running from his past, yet  it is his knowledge  of human character that makes him unique.  Burt  Lancaster adds wonderfully in the film as just a great guy who finally gets  to live out his dream. The location in Iowa is beautiful, and the ballpark  in the cornfield makes you want to drop what you are doing and go there to  catch a game. After I saw this movie I became an instant Baseball fanatic  and thanks to &quot;Field Of Dreams&quot; I now know so much about the  early New York Yankees,  The Brooklyn Dodgers, The Boston Braves and many  other &quot;old style&quot; games.  I enjoy going to baseball games and  catch them from the Little League to Major League Baseball.  All of this  due to &quot;Field Of Dreams&quot;.

This film is built around those same elements. But, it isn't really a movie about baseball per se. If you're expecting a typical baseball movie, be advised that this ain't it. Give it a chance anyway - you might be surprised.Rather, it's about the human condition, and the endless choices we make throughout our lives - and their effects down the road. I'll admit I love baseball, and was not disappointed with that element of the story. But baseball runs parallel to the story, it's not the focus.If you're a Costner fan, you'll like his performance. He portrays Ray Kinsella, an average Joe caught up in a real-life fantasy. Mysterious voices, a supernatural baseball field, flesh-and-blood ghosts, and a series of illogical events keeps the audience off-balance throughout the film. Forget about figuring out whodunnit until well into the movie - even then you're in for some surprises.The supporting cast hold up the story nicely, and IMO give this fantasy a needed touch of reality as a counterpoint to Costner's wacky impulses. James Earl Jones was made for his role as Terrance Mann, a character loosely based on J.D. Salinger. Once a hard-driving force for change in the 1960s, he lost the idealism and passion he once had - or did he? To say Jones adds depth to the film is an understatement. Jones and Costner together make this story work.I could go on, but after all this time most folks have already read the synopsis. I will say you'll most likely want to watch this more than once - the plot moves somewhat erratically and scenes change often.

Just some thoughts on this Kevin Costner movie...Field Of Dreams (1989) stars Kevin Costner, James Earl Jones, Amy Madigan, Burt Lancaster, Ray Liotta, and Frank Whaley.  It's a good baseball fantasy movie.  The 1919 Black Sox are featured in this movie, which I think is cool.  I'm a fan of the Deadball Era in general, so seeing players from the 1900s and 1910s was neat.  The acting in this movie is OK.  The best acting comes from Ray Liotta in his role as ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson.  I thought Amy Madigan was a little over the top, bordering on camp.  This is one of those movies that requires the viewer to really, I mean REALLY suspend disbelief.  I found it rather strange that Costner and Madigan's characters had virtually no reaction when Joe Jackson suddenly appeared.While I think The Natural (1984) is not only the best baseball fantasy movie ever, but the best baseball movie ever, Field Of Dreams is good as well.  But it's not in the same league (no pun intended) as The Natural.  Still, a solid baseball movie.",4,"Cream of the crop?

Heck, classic may not be a strong enough word to describe ""Field of Dreams"". ""Masterpiece"" may be more fitting.It is a film that has it's foundation built on evening catches with dad and laid-back saturday afternoons, eating hot dogs at the ballpark, and watching your favorite player field a ball or take the mound or step into the batters box to belt a home run - hopefully in your direction. It's a film deep-rooted in the nostalgia that surrounds the game and it's rich history and harkens back to a simpler, more innocent time, when baseball was played for the love of the game. Unlike the steroid-laden and greed-driven abomination that the game has become today, baseball used to be something that was more than a game to the people of America. It was our life blood, a living, breathing embodiment of the American spirit. Somehow, that has gotten lost, but the root values are still there, somewhere, under all the muck and filth that the current version of the game has heaped upon it. That is what this film is about.This isn't simply just another ""baseball"" or ""sports"" film. It is a movie about characters and relationships. Not just the central figures of Ray Kinsella and ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson, but of Rays patient and understanding wife Annie, their daughter Karen, Ray's father John, the embittered former writer and civil rights activist Terrence Mann (brilliantly portrayed by James Earl Jones), Annie's brother Mark, who plays the role of antagonist of this film, as well as Archie ""Moonlight"" Graham, the former ball player turned small town doctor who never got his shot to show what he could do, touchingly protrayed by film legend Burt Lancaster in one of his final roles.""Field of Dreams"" is a movie that is sentimental; a poingnant, Norman Rockwell-esque painting of Americana set to celluloid. It is a movie of regret and retribution, a celebration of life and love that tugs at your heartstrings while simultaneously lifting your spirits.

Perez ""Jose""","[1, 2]","Forget &quot;Dances with Wolves.&quot;  Kevin Costner outdoes himself as an actor in this superb Capra-esque movie that is filled with magic rarely seen onscreen.  Stereotyped as a sports film, &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; is much much more than that.  In fact, I'd classify it as a movie about the human spirit, as much about family and faith as it is about baseball, and more than anything, as a metaphoric, lyrical answer to the eternal question we as human beings ask every day - what is life all about?  Cinematic fables come in all forms and shapes, from the great &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; to the crowd pleasing &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot; and the home-as-heaven &quot;ET&quot; and &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot;  &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; challenges one of our cultures' greatest missteps - the emphasis we place on the separation of the sexes...the sad, but true, reality of what is means to be a &quot;man&quot; or a &quot;woman&quot; to be masculine vs feminine.  In a culture that holds dear the idea that &quot;real men don't eat quiche,&quot; &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; tells us that that perhaps salvation awaits in men eating quiche every so often, and women running companies or even the country as leaders one day.  The movie forces is to look at our own mores and values, to suspend for a few hours our earthbound logic, most of which no longer serves us as citizens of a brave new world.  In doing so, it also makes us wonder what and who we ourselves would be IF our dreams really did take flight, if we &quot;built it&quot; would they actually come?  In my opinion, thi sis a movie that ought to be required viewing in order to graduate high school - in fact, perhaps even sooner - so as to create within future generations not just a sense that hope does exist, but more than that - that it's up to each individual to persue and realize their dreams for the betterment of our common earth.  Costner shines, as does Amy Madigan, and especially unforgettably Ray Liotta - one of the best actors out there, and rarely better than he is here.  Shoeless Joe Jackson exists in our dreams, but our dreams cannot exist without his real, present existence.  This is classic storytelling at its finest hour.  And men ... bring a hankerchief, and allow yourselves a tear or two.  You'll feel better, more alive than ever before, and you'll quickly realize that life canot be taken for granted.  A stunning masterpiece, destined to become one of Hollywood's greatest achievements.

54190,A2BDJOIXPR2AYU,0783225881,King of Controversy,"[2, 10]","Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) hears voices in his cornfield, ""Build it, and they will come"". Are there voices in his head, or voices in his corn field?Much like, 'Roy', a family man who 'sees' UFOs in the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind (which to his relief, turn out to be real UFOs - or are they?) The voices Farmer Ray hears turn out to be real too -er the voices of ghosts. At least other people begin to hear them too.""Build it, and they will come"".""Build it"" apparently being a baseball field on his farm in Iowa. Ray builds a magic ballpark on his farm instead of growing corn. This decision ends up causing him to lose the farm later in the movie (tho the magic ballpark looks only big enough to displace, what? a couple hundred dollars worth of corn?).Ghosts of great baseball players of the past do appear, playing in his magic ballpark before sundown each night.Ray, his family, and the summer-farm look wonderful. Costner looks at ease. There's no violence or sex in the movie (unless you count Ray's marriage to mean Ray has every guy's dream of sex whenever). Come to think of it, his marriage pretty much explains why there's no violence, either. The problem is, what's fun about watching baseball? That's what we are asked to do in 'Field of Dreams'. Watching ghosts play baseball doesn't seem very meaningful, or believable, or fun. Playing baseball is fun. When you're 12 years old and pile into a wagon for a trip to dairy queen after a win, that's fun. It's something, just belonging to a team, and, sheer joy running the bases. I don't remember losing being that bad either. Perhaps it is dangerous. It hurts if the ball hits you, even if the pitcher's 12 years old. And a bit dangerous too, when you put that mitt over your face to make the catch on a long fly ball. And your feelings could get hurt if you don't perform. Actually, would we even play baseball if there were no audience?Ray's told to visit Terry Mann in Philadelphia, an old baseball writer and bring him out to the magic park. Mann (James Earl Jones) turns out to be the noble, infinitely wise black man. Whether Mann is here to assure us, it's OK we're liking this movie, or whether he's here to tell us, this movie is important and, we really should be liking it, I'm not sure. Well, I really wasn't feeling-it up to this point, so I'm guessing the later.Mann travels with Ray back to the farm and is amazed to watch the old players. Is this baseball heaven? The players don't say much and don't seem to know themselves if this is baseball heaven. They do seem content.Ray actually meets his dad, a player who died when Ray was very young. Ray is older than his dad. Ray, has become the dad, in a sense, watching the game.Writer Terry Mann is quite old actually, and the ghosts encourage him to walk across the magic park into the cornfield, to  cross over to the other side. This is the most touching moment in the story. Mann walks happily with the old players into the corn field and his body slowly fades into mist. This is a touching moment, and, I was trying to believe he was going to baseball heaven, but just a tiny part of my mind, just a tiny part, was waiting for aliens to come out, or demons to reach up and grab him or something. It's a cornfield in twilight. And to tell the truth, we don't get to see where they are taking Mann, and the ghosts never really do truly explain what they are.This isn't the climax of the movie, tho. Ray's friend, who's been begging Ray to come to his senses and sell the farm, has a change of heart when he sees the Ghosts too. He says, ""whatever you do Ray, don't sell this farm"". Even this isn't the climax of the movie. The climax, is when they see headlights of distant cars driving to the farm. Cars filled with people magically drawn to the magic park, ""if you build it, they will come"". Cars filled with people willing apparently to pay money to watch baseball. Money enough to save Ray's family and his farm.We've come to the movies message: It's OK to have Hollywood inspired dreams, but you have to find a way to feed yourself and your family. So get off your rear and get to work. Or get busy with your hustle, whatever it is you do.I don't need Hollywood to tell me to get up and get to work.

Even after nearly twenty years nothing prepares me for ""Dad.....want to play catch"".This is a great movie about a guy who goes against everything (family, economic pressures, his own instincts) to plow under his cornfield to build a baseball field after a mysterious voice tells him to do so.  Soon the ghost of Shoeless Joe Jackson appears and Ray Kinsella (the farmer) believes the instructions are an attempt to ease the pain of the disgraced ball player.  But the story adds layers of complexity as Ray continues to receive strange and seemingly pointless instructions that soon snare a reclusive writer and another ghost....this time a small town doctor who never found his fifteen minutes of fame as a major leaguer.

'If you build it, he will come,' 'Ease his pain,' and 'Go the distance.'  Well this movie certainly went the distance.The music is what really makes the movie great.  The music we hear towards the end of the movie give me the chills and it just makes me cry...in a good way.You don't have to like baseball to like this movie.

54198,AKX28FGA6L47J,0783225881,Mark,"[2, 2]","Kevin Costner is as perplexing as a Rubik's Cube (at least it was tough for me to figure out.!).Here's a guy who starred in perhaps two of the worst films ever - ""Waterworld"" and ""The Postman"" and yet was single handedly responsible for the epic masterpiece ""Dances With Wolves"".And, of course, this beautiful film - ""Field of Dreams"".I'm not going to provide a recap / synopsis of the plot - that's been done very, very well by many of the reviewers here.I guess it was inevitable that I would feel a connection with this movie. As a guy who grew up living in southern California, I fell in love with baseball at a very early age. In fact, as a youngster / teenager, it's all I can remember doing when I wasn't in school. I guess I was a decent player because I was scouted by the Cincinnati Reds and offered a minor league contract.I was also a teenager who had a very difficult and, at times. estranged relationship with his father - which is the ""sub plot"" at the heart of this magical story. And in view of the fact that my dad passed away about a year ago, needless to say, the ending depiciting the meeting of Kevin and his dad can certainly trigger alot of emotions in me.When you really think about it, this movie could have failed so easily. For example, it could have tried to ""explain"" the magic of the cornfield - or Costner ""going back in time"" and meeting Moonlight Graham, superbly played by Burt Lancaster. And if it had tried, it could / would have lost all credibility. Because there is no ""rational"" explanation for the events depicted in this film.Instead it didn't even try - the events just happened and if you didn't ""feel"" the magic because you were too busy trying to understand the logic of it, you would be the poorer for it.As a Red Sox fan, I also loved the fact that Costner had to seek out James Earl Jones in Boston and actually attend a game at fabled Fenway Park. Could you possibly imagine these two characters attending a game together at some modern behemouth stadium and buying into the notion that something "" supernatural"" was happening. Personally, it wouldn't have had nearly the same impact.Let me make another recommendation - consider purchasing the soundtrack to this film as well. The music provides a perfect backdrop to the wonderful feeling conjured up by this movie, especially the long last song which is played as Kevin and his dad meet again.At a time when movies rely so heavily on special effects in order to mask the fact that there is no plot. Or that studios just keep on pumping out horrid sequels in a blatant cash grab. Or studios are so devoid of original ideas that they have to make films of tired old television series i.e Charlie's Angels / Mod Squad / Starsky and Hutch - it's an absolute pleasure to watch a movie that's so original and so fresh that it's like nothing you've ever seen before..!!Or are likely to see again.This is a very, very special movie and if Costner was to spend the next 30 years making turkeys like the Postman, at least we would always be grateful to him for this gem.",5,Costner's Finest Moment,1113523200,"04 15, 2005",2005,3064,"['Kevin', 'Costner', 'as', 'perplexing', 'Rubik', 'Cube', 'least', 'was', 'tough', 'figure', 'out.', 'guy', 'who', 'starred', 'perhaps', 'two', 'worst', 'films', 'ever', 'Waterworld', 'Postman', 'yet', 'was', 'single', 'handedly', 'responsible', 'epic', 'masterpiece', 'Wolves', '.And', 'course', 'beautiful', 'film', 'Field', 'Dreams', '.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'provide', 'recap', '/', 'synopsis', 'plot', 'been', 'done', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here.I', 'guess', 'was', 'inevitable', 'would', 'feel', 'connection', 'movie', 'guy', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'living', 'southern', 'California', 'fell', 'love', 'baseball', 'very', 'early', 'age', 'fact', 'youngster', '/', 'teenager', 'can', 'remember', 'doing', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'school', 'guess', 'was', 'decent', 'player', 'was', 'scouted', 'Cincinnati', 'Reds', 'offered', 'minor', 'league', 'contract.I', 'was', 'also', 'teenager', 'who', 'had', 'very', 'difficult', 'times', 'estranged', 'relationship', 'father', 'sub', 'plot', 'heart', 'magical', 'story', 'view', 'fact', 'dad', 'passed', 'away', 'year', 'ago', 'needless', 'say', 'ending', 'depiciting', 'meeting', 'Kevin', 'dad', 'can', 'certainly', 'trigger', 'alot', 'emotions', 'me.When', 'really', 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'failed', 'so', 'easily', 'example', 'could', 'have', 'tried', 'explain', 'magic', 'cornfield', 'Costner', 'going', 'back', 'time', 'meeting', 'Moonlight', 'Graham', 'superbly', 'played', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'had', 'tried', 'could', '/', 'would', 'have', 'lost', 'credibility', 'rational', 'explanation', 'events', 'depicted', 'film.Instead', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'events', 'just', 'happened', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'magic', 'were', 'too', 'busy', 'trying', 'understand', 'logic', 'would', 'be', 'poorer', 'it.As', 'Red', 'Sox', 'fan', 'also', 'loved', 'fact', 'Costner', 'had', 'seek', 'out', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Boston', 'actually', 'attend', 'game', 'fabled', 'Fenway', 'Park', 'Could', 'possibly', 'imagine', 'two', 'characters', 'attending', 'game', 'together', 'modern', 'behemouth', 'stadium', 'buying', 'notion', 'something', 'supernatural', 'was', 'happening', 'Personally', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'nearly', 'same', 'impact.Let', 'make', 'recommendation', 'consider', 'purchasing', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'perfect', 'backdrop', 'wonderful', 'feeling', 'conjured', 'up', 'movie', 'especially', 'long', 'last', 'song', 'played', 'Kevin', 'dad', 'meet', 'time', 'when', 'movies', 'rely', 'so', 'heavily', 'special', 'effects', 'order', 'mask', 'fact', 'plot', 'studios', 'just', 'keep', 'pumping', 'out', 'horrid', 'sequels', 'blatant', 'cash', 'grab', 'studios', 'are', 'so', 'devoid', 'original', 'ideas', 'have', 'make', 'films', 'tired', 'old', 'television', 'series', 'i.e', 'Charlie', 'Angels', '/', 'Mod', 'Squad', '/', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'absolute', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'movie', 'so', 'original', 'so', 'fresh', 'nothing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'before..', 'are', 'likely', 'see', 'again.This', 'very', 'very', 'special', 'movie', 'Costner', 'was', 'spend', 'next', '30', 'years', 'making', 'turkeys', 'Postman', 'least', 'would', 'always', 'be', 'grateful', 'gem']",N/A

Past, present, and future combine to give me some memories that I will always cherish throughout my life. Field Of Dreams describes my sentiments to the fullest.Ray Kinsella, Iowa farmer, played by Kevin Costner, has baseball in his blood. Growing up without a father who was a major league baseball player with other baseball greats, set the entire mood for this story. In the middle of his corn field he decided to build a baseball field that people thought was crazy. And, he could sit there for long hours dreaming and visualizing watching all the great, hall-of-fame, baseball players of the past, having fun playing baseball on his baseball field. There were many nostalgic moments.Baseball sets the stage for all the action packed events to take place with drama that captivates audiences of all ages along with some fantasy and relationships with other people. It's a real tear-jerking story filled with family hope and baseball.The movie had a great cast of actors, actresses, and behind the scene personnel, along with Phil Alden Robinson, its director. You couldn't asked for anything more than to see Kevin Costner, Ray Liotta, James Earl Jones, Gabby Hoffmann, and Amy Madigan, along with others to set the mood throughout this suspenseful story.Hearing strange whispers and shifting back and forth between the presence of past generations to the present is superb and makes for a great story line throughout this fabulous movie.

The voices don't stop there and Ray is told to &quot;Heal his Pain.&quot;Ray then goes to Boston to find the legendary 60's writer Terrance Mann(James Earl Jones). Mann is reluctant to go with Ray thinking he is a crazy hippie stalking him. He goes with and ends up seeing another message along with Ray. They are suppose to help out Moonlight Graham, a baseball player who played in one game and never got to have an at bat. There quest sends them to Minnesotta to find him which they do. Ray talks to Dr. Graham(Burt Lancaster)where he finds out the dr had no regrets about leaving baseball, but it was his dream to do it again. In the meantime the farm is going under and Ray's brother in law is trying to get the farm to sell it.Will Ray be able to save the farm and figure out why he built the field? Will all these guys get there second chances in  baseball? That's the magic that is Field of Dreams.Kevin Costner is great in the film. This is the one that made his a house hold name and solidified his place as a pop culture icon. He's great and is believable. No other actor has shown his love for baseball as much as Costner. This is the best sports flick he's ever done.Mad props have to go to James Earl Jones, Ray Liotta, and Burt Lancaster. They are all great in there supportive roles. This is the best film Ray Liotta has done to date. Jones is great and it's great to see him act. To often does he do voices or doesn't have a main role, but his supportive role is great. Burt Lancaster almost makes me cry in the movie in the scene near the end.Field of Dreams is one of the best movies you will ever see.

However, this film is more than that: it is a story of ghosts, of fathers and sons,  and reconnecting hopes and dreams together.Kevin Costner, is a terrific  and wholly believable performance, plays Ray Kinsella, a former hippie and  current Iowa farmer, living with his wife, Annie (Amy Madigan) and daughter  Karen (Gaby Hoffmann).  As he walks through his cornfields one day, he  hears a voice that says to him: ""If you build it, he will come.""  Costner  interprets this message to mean that he should build a baseball field in  the middle of his farm, even though it would mean a terrible financial  loss.  From there, the story takes twists and turns involving the writer  Terrence Mann, the great, but shamed baseball star Shoeless Joe Jackson,  and others.Most of all, though, this film is about second chances.  Without giving away too much, it should  be said that Phil Alden Robinson,  who both brilliantly wrote and directed this film, manages to takes the  very best emotions from the game and merges them with the importance of  family, redemption, and even magic.

One day while he is working out in the cornfield, he hears the words &quot;If you build it, they will come.&quot; This inspires Ray to build a baseball field in the middle of his cornfield. His wife Annie ( Amy Madigan) supports him. But the mission does not stop with building the field. Ray is given more signs that tell him to seek out reclusive novelist ( James Earl Jones), and a player that sacrificed his dream of playing baseball, to be a doctor (Burt Lanchaster). However his persistance is rewarded, when spirits from baseball's past, which include the legendary Shoeless Joe Jackson ( Ray Liotta), start to appear on the field and play games amonsgt themselves.&quot;Field of Dreams&quot; is one of my favorite movies. The film succeeds on so many levels. The script is absolutely flawless. It features a wonderful mix of baseball, the relationship between father and son, determination, and the undying power of love. The cast is first rate. Kevin Costner, James Earl Jones, Amy Madigan, Burt Lancaster, Ray Liotta, and Timothy Busfield are all spectacular in their roles and really bring the story to life. In all of the films I have seen, the score to &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; is one of the most beautiful and powerful scores I have ever heard. The baseball action in this film is extremely fun to watch. I love how spirits from baseball's past are used, which symbolizes that the magic of baseball will never die. That was a stroke of genius! Director Phil Alden Robinson managed to actually stay historically accurate to all of the players as well. The way Ray Liotta is able to immitate Shoeless Joe Jackson down to the last detail of his playing style is amazing. One of the best features is that the film is set in Iowa. This provided for the corn field which adds a sense of magic to the film. Watching the players dissapear as they walk into the cornfield is breathtaking. But the most memorable thing about the movie without a doubt is the ending. It has to be one of the most touching and memorable endings ever captured on film.The DVD is a treat on its own. You get commentary by director Phil Alden Robinson and cinematographer John Lindley, a &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; video scrapbook featuring new interviews with cast and crew, behind-the-scenes footage, and MORE! This is definately a must own film for anyone's DVD collection.&quot;America has been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt, and then erased again.

The film's moral message had a profound impact on me. I first saw it when I was a little kid and loved it; I understand and love it even more today.The story is about an Iowa farmer named Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) and his family. Kinsella hears a voice one day while walking in his cornfields. It tells him ""if you build it, he will come."" He interprets it that if he builts a baseball diamond in his cornfield, Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta) will appear again. Kinsella proceeds to built it, and magical things begin to happen.I won't go any farther. ""Field of Dreams"" is another example of how utterly dumb the Academy Awards are. It lost the Best Picture honor to ""Driving Miss Daisy."" Whatever. Kevin Costner does a great job in the lead role. The script was sublime, and the rest of the acting was as well.

54218,A215P85W653CZV,0783225881,"Nagronsky ""Nagronsky""","[5, 6]","I met Bill Kinsella in the early 80's. I had read a little bit about this little baseball book from a guy from British Columbia, and when I saw this clapped out car with vacu-formed signs touting a book called ""Shoeless Joe"" park near me, I popped over to say Hi. Bill Kinsella was/is a sort of scraggy looking dude, and was pretty interesting to talk to, so I walked with him to Elliott Bay Books, and bought a copy, which Kinsella duly signed. He re-autographed it more personally at a later reading after I told him I had called Larry King's radio show, and highly recommended it.In spring of '89 I was walking past a theatre & saw a poster for a movie called ""Field Of Dreams"", which I had never heard of, but then I saw it had Kevin Costner, who I'd liked inSilveradoand envied inNo Way Outfor a little backseat scene with Sean Young. Then I noticed in the fine print ""Based on the novelShoeless Joeby W. P. Kinsella"". I immediately bought a ticket for the next showing, and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and was all choked up at the ending. I did miss many aspects of the novel, such as the replacement of J. D. Salinger by a character called Terrence Mann(well-played by James Earl Jones), and the elimination of characters of the hero's brother, and ""The World's Oldest Living Chicago Cub"", Eddie ""Kid"" Scissons, but still thought it was well done. After I got out of the movie, I called a lady friend who I had turned on toShoeless Joe& told her about it, and ""Field Of Dreams"" became the second movie I've ever watched twice in one day.(the other wasBrazil...how did that happen??)When DVD's came out, ""Field Of Dreams"" was one of the first I bought, but until I bought this 2-disc set, I probably hadn't watched it in 5 or 6 years.When my new copy arrived, I immediately went to the 2nd disc & the Extras. The first extra I watched was the ""From Page To Screen"" feature from The Bravo Channel which did little more than piss me off: Anna Geddes, who wrote & directed this knew or cared nothing about the book, or its genesis: the bookShoeless Joewas derived from a short story, the title story from Kinsella'sShoeless Joe Jackson Comes to Iowa. I also had a problem with the way the narrator of ""From Page To Screen"" went on and on about ""an American classic"", but didn't mention the facts that Kinsella is Canadian, or that he lived in Iowa while attending the Writer's Program at the University Of Iowa. Of course, The Bravo Channel has become a joke like A&E;, living off of ""Reality"" TV instead of stressing quality content.After my disgust with From Page To Screen, I was pretty much delighted with all the other DVD Extras: a round table discussion with Costner and some ex-MLB stars was fun; the deleted scenes were OK, with only one that I thought should have been retained in the film; I enjoyed the visit to Galena, Illinois, which served as Chisholm, Minnesota in the movie; the Look Inside ""Field Of Dreams"" was well done, and I realized that the director & producers really had a passion for the book and the film, and I had never, ever heard that Bill Kinsella's original title for the book was ""Dream Field""; The great bit was From Father to Son: Passing Along the Pastime, with a conversation with Dwier Brown, who played the young father of Ray Kinsella, making buying this edition TOTALLY worth it. Although it was moving when the producers of the movie told of losing their Father at ""a young age"", Dwier Brown lost his Dad less than a month before he appeared in ""Field Of Dreams"" and BARELY kept it together when he talked about speaking with his Dad on the father's deathbed.The transfer of the new edition was just fine, and one more thing, especially aimed at the reviewer who gave FOD 1-star due to his only getting 1 disc, in a 1 disc box:When you're looking at a DVD (or a book) that has multiple editions, make sure you contact the seller either before you buy, or as soon as you buy.

They couldn't have been more wrong as Field Of Dreams was a smash hit and the finest role of his career.  Mr. Costner is Ray Kinsella, a Iowa corn farmer struggling to get by.  He keeps hearing voices that say &quot;if you build, he will come&quot;.  He figures out through a vision that it is a baseball field that is to be built.  Everyone except his wife Annie (Amy Madigan) thinks he nuts.  After the field is built, players start coming out the field to play on it.  Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta) is one of them.  No one but Ray and his family can see them.  He has another vision that leads him James Earl Jones, a reclusive writer from the 60's, living in Boston.  Along the way back, they pick up a young ball player.  The player then turns out to be a doctor (Burt Lancaster) who saves Ray's daughter from choking.  The film is a real fantasy and has an oddball plot, but all the actors give likable performances.  The film, despite its plot revolving around Baseball, is not a sports movie.  Baseball is used as an allegory for life.  On the field, players who have had checkered pasts or left life with situations unsettled have a chance at redemption.  One of the most touching scenes is where Ray has a catch with his father on the field.  His father had past away and they never had a chance to resolve their differences, but on the field, everything is okay.  His father is younger and doesn't know Ray is his son.  He is just another ballplayer who has come to the field.

But 'build what' and 'who' will come? Ray soon comes to realize that he must build a baseball diamond in his field. Unfortunately for him, no one believes him and thinks he's totally crazy. The only support he has is from his wife Anni (Amy Madigan) and his daughter Karin (Gaby Hoffmann). After he completes his baseball diamond, Ray meets the famous Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta). Also coming to meet Terence Mann (James Earl Jones) and Archibald 'Moonlight' Graham (Burt Lancaster), Ray learns that heaven is where your dreams come true.A very interesting story, not at all what I though it would be. Though baseball is the 'theme' of the movie, baseball is in a way only a subplot of the story. In a way, ""Field of Dreams"" is a bit hard to tell 'what the story's about' but I assure you that once you watch it, you will enjoy it very much. Once you do see it, I recommend you read the trivia about the movie since it's very interesting to read about the history of American baseball and the 60's and how it relates in the movie.The acting is pretty well done with Kevin Costner giving a terrific performance. It's also lots of fun to see two very legendary and amazing actors, Burt Lancaster and James Earl Jones. The humor is also well placed all the lines are delivered well. One of my favorites lines are:Mark: ""Admit it, Ray. You've never liked farming.""Ray Kinsella: ""That's not true.""Mark: ""It is true. You don't know the first thing about farming.""Ray Kinsella: ""Yes I do. I know a lot about farming. I know more than you think I know.""Mark: ""Then how could you plow under your major crop?""Ray Kinsella: ""What's a crop?""The whole movie is a very heartwarming experience and I can say that most anybody will enjoy the film. The movie is rated PG though because of some language so younger children are advised to watch with their parents. Plus, I think that younger children would find this type of movie a bit boring. For those who like Kevin Costner, here are a few more movies he has played in (the first two also being baseball movies):""Bull Durham""""For Love of the Game""""Silverado""""Dances with Wolves""",5,"""I have just built something totally illogical!""",1026777600,"07 16, 2002",2002,2398,"['years', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'baseball', 'movies', 'baseball', 'movie', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'Fields', 'Dreams', 'story', 'Iowa', 'farmer', 'Ray', 'Kinsella', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'blue', 'voice', 'voice', 'saying', 'build', 'will', 'come', ""'build"", 'what', ""'who"", 'will', 'come', 'Ray', 'soon', 'realize', 'must', 'build', 'baseball', 'diamond', 'field', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'totally', 'crazy', 'only', 'support', 'wife', 'Anni', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'daughter', 'Karin', 'Gaby', 'Hoffmann', 'baseball', 'diamond', 'Ray', 'famous', 'Shoeless', 'Joe', 'Jackson', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Also', 'coming', 'meet', 'Terence', 'Mann', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Archibald', ""'Moonlight"", 'Graham', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Ray', 'heaven', 'where', 'dreams', 'come', 'true.A', 'very', 'interesting', 'story', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'baseball', ""'theme"", 'movie', 'baseball', 'way', 'only', 'subplot', 'story', 'way', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'bit', 'hard', 'tell', 'story', 'assure', 'once', 'watch', 'will', 'enjoy', 'very', 'much', 'Once', 'do', 'see', 'recommend', 'read', 'trivia', 'movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'read', 'history', 'American', 'baseball', '60', 'how', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'giving', 'terrific', 'performance', 'also', 'lots', 'fun', 'see', 'two', 'very', 'legendary', 'amazing', 'actors', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'humor', 'also', 'well', 'placed', 'lines', 'are', 'delivered', 'well', 'One', 'favorites', 'lines', 'are', 'Mark', 'Admit', 'Ray', ""'ve"", 'never', 'liked', 'farming', 'Ray', 'Kinsella', 'not', 'true', 'Mark', 'true', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'first', 'thing', 'farming', 'Ray', 'Kinsella', 'Yes', 'do', 'know', 'lot', 'farming', 'know', 'more', 'think', 'know', 'Mark', 'Then', 'how', 'could', 'plow', 'major', 'crop', 'Ray', 'Kinsella', 'What', 'crop', 'whole', 'movie', 'very', 'heartwarming', 'experience', 'can', 'say', 'most', 'anybody', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'movie', 'rated', 'PG', 'language', 'so', 'younger', 'children', 'are', 'advised', 'watch', 'parents', 'think', 'younger', 'children', 'would', 'find', 'type', 'movie', 'bit', 'boring', 'who', 'like', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'here', 'are', 'few', 'more', 'movies', 'played', 'first', 'two', 'also', 'being', 'baseball', 'movies', 'Bull', 'Durham', 'Love', 'Game', 'Silverado', 'Wolves']",N/A

Williams ""political ethnographer""","[2, 2]","Kevin Costner is fantastic as 36 year-old ex-hippie turned Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella, husband (his wife is played by Amy Madigan) and father (to one daughter).  Mysterious voices tell him to plow under his corn field and build a baseball diamond and field.  His wife believes in him and his voices, so he does.  His brother-in-law thinks he's nuts, especially when he can't make his mortgage payments and the viewer is inclined to agree with him.During the baseball diamond building project, we learn that Ray Kinsella's father loved baseball and loved his son.  But his son, Ray, felt smothered by his Dad and in keeping with the cultural programming of his day, took off on his own - ""I'm scared to death of turning into my father"".  No doubt, he broke his father's heart.Soon after the ball field is built, ghosts from the 1919 Chicago White Sox appear from the adjoining corn field and want to play ball.  Among them is ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson, played by Ray Liotta.  Before long, Ray Kinsella is playing baseball with them.  But to his brother-in-law, who can't see the ghosts, he's bonkers.Then the voices come back one night and tell him to find former sports writer Terrance Mann, played by James Earl Jones, whose libertarian novel ""The Boat-Rocker"" was misinterpreted by Ray to stop playing baseball with his Dad.  Ray's farm is about to be repossessed, but his wife supports him - he jumps into his Volkwagen bus and heads east where eventually finds Terrance Mann, then takes him to a ballgame, and then a message appears on the advert screen telling them to track down an old doctor.  They do, and learn that the doc once played pro-ball for one inning.One the way back to Iowa, Ray Kinsella and Terrance Mann stop for a hitchhiker, who turns out to be the doc when he  was a kid.  Back at the Iowa ball field, Terrance Mann is in baseball heaven (literally, since he died back east and it was his ghost that rode back to Iowa with Ray Kinsella).  The doc plays with the White Sox in baseball heaven too, but when Ray's daughter chokes on a hotdog, the doc runs out of baseball heaven to do a tamer version of the Heimlich maneuver and saves her from choking.  Forever a doctor again, ""Shoeless"" Joe tells ""Doc"" he was good enough to be pro.The finale is when Ray's dad comes out of the corn to play ball with the other ghosts.  He is very young and Ray thinks that his dad doesn't recognise him, saying ""I only saw him years later when he was worn down by life"".  He plays catch with his Dad and afterward his Dad asks him ""Is this Heaven?"".  Ray says it is Iowa.  He meets Ray's wife and daughter, they exchange some small talk, then he departs.  As the Dad is walking back toward the cornfield where the ghosts come from, Ray calls out ""DAD?"".  His Dad stops and looks back.  ""You want to have a catch?""  At this point, the viewer may feel some habernero in his eyes.Cars full of people come to pay money to Ray to sit at his ballfield, a shrine to their memories.  The bank repossessors do not get the farm.  Everything is sentimentally hunky-dory.

54238,A10Q8NIFOVOHFV,0783225881,Robert S. Clay Jr.,"[4, 6]","Great fantasy of baseball nostalgia, family relationships, and unfulfilled dreams.  The key word is &quot;fantasy.&quot;  Forget logic,  suspend disbelief, and you will do fine.  The gentle sentiment and warmhearted humor of the movie cover a multitude of unlikely plot developments.  Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner), sort of an updated version of Jimmy Stewart's &quot;every man,&quot; embarks on a seemingly foolish task inspired by a ghostly &quot;voice&quot; to convert his cornfield into a baseball field.  Amy Madigan is both comical and frustrated as Ray's wife, an aging activist from the '60s.  As a kooky ex-radical, she initially supports the goofy idea.  Upon mature reflection, however, she worries about the income needed to save the family farm.  Things take on a definite other-worldly quality when Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta) and other old-time players appear on the mist-shrouded field and play ball.  Adding to the mystery, the &quot;voice&quot; directs Ray to a reclusive writer (James Earl Jones).  He is drawn kicking and screaming into Ray's real-life fantasy, until he becomes intrigued by the possibilities.  Burt Lancaster is excellent as Doc Graham.  Doc's demise 16 years before our story doesn't stop him from playing an essential role in the plot.  50 years ago he yearned to be a baseball player, but a career in medicine got in the way.  Ultimately, the mystic ball field represents the yearning in everyone to find a peaceful place where dreams come true, and lost opportunities are found.  The fade-out displaying a long line of cars driving to Ray's field makes this point nicely.  Relax and enjoy the fantasy. ;-)",5,The mystic power of baseball.,986342400,"04 4, 2001",2001,1652,"['Great', 'fantasy', 'baseball', 'nostalgia', 'family', 'relationships', 'unfulfilled', 'dreams', 'key', 'word', 'quot', 'quot', 'Forget', 'logic', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'will', 'do', 'fine', 'gentle', 'sentiment', 'warmhearted', 'humor', 'movie', 'multitude', 'unlikely', 'plot', 'developments', 'Ray', 'Kinsella', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'sort', 'updated', 'version', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'quot', 'man', 'quot', 'embarks', 'seemingly', 'foolish', 'task', 'inspired', 'ghostly', 'quot', 'voice', 'quot', 'convert', 'cornfield', 'baseball', 'field', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'comical', 'frustrated', 'Ray', 'wife', 'aging', 'activist', ""'60s"", 'kooky', 'ex-radical', 'initially', 'goofy', 'idea', 'mature', 'reflection', 'however', 'income', 'needed', 'save', 'family', 'farm', 'Things', 'take', 'definite', 'other-worldly', 'quality', 'when', 'Shoeless', 'Joe', 'Jackson', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'other', 'old-time', 'players', 'appear', 'mist-shrouded', 'field', 'play', 'ball', 'Adding', 'mystery', 'quot', 'voice', 'quot', 'Ray', 'reclusive', 'writer', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'drawn', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'Ray', 'real-life', 'fantasy', 'intrigued', 'possibilities', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'excellent', 'Doc', 'Graham', 'Doc', 'demise', '16', 'years', 'story', ""n't"", 'stop', 'playing', 'essential', 'role', 'plot', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'yearned', 'be', 'baseball', 'player', 'career', 'medicine', 'got', 'way', 'Ultimately', 'mystic', 'ball', 'field', 'yearning', 'everyone', 'find', 'peaceful', 'place', 'where', 'come', 'true', 'lost', 'opportunities', 'are', 'found', 'fade-out', 'displaying', 'long', 'line', 'cars', 'driving', 'Ray', 'field', 'point', 'nicely', 'Relax', 'enjoy', 'fantasy']",N/A

I said a little prayer and out of the blue two days later I got a call to work on Total Recall.  I know its sounds as improbable as following a vision to build a baseball field in your cornfield but its true. But my little life is beside the point.  This is a terrific film with sentiment and warmth on par with the great classics of Frank Capra. This film washes its themes of baseball and following your dreams with unabashed romance that makes you want to believe in the impossible for a couple swell hours.  As much as I would like to wax nostalgic over the joys of watching Field of Dreams, I have a more important message to relay.  Universal has been holding a lot of its great and not-so-great titles hostage for unreasonably high prices out of step with the rest of the marketplace for too long and its time to call them to the carpet for it. Field of Dreams is one of the worst inflation examples for a modern film as the DVD was released back in 1998. But the saddest thing is older classics and non-classics are difficult to collect. Because given the choice between buying three new films with great sound and in depth features from other studios vs. buying two older Universal titles for the same cash outlay, as much as I would like to own films like Bride of Frankenstein I tend to go for quantity and value.

Well, I'm glad that Ray Kinsella (author of the book &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;) and screenwriter Phil Alden Robinson didn't attend the Iowa Writers' Workshop.FIELD OF DREAMS is a marvelous examination of America's infatuation with baseball and a moving exploration of family loyalties. Ray (as sensitively played by Kevin Costner) has a loving wife (Amy Madigan, making it look so easy) and a doting daughter, but something is missing. A voice tells him that he must build a baseball field in his corn crop (in Iowa!). When he does, the apparition of Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta) shows up to play. What follows is a series of baseball adventures on and off Ray's baseball diamond, as well as in and out of the present day. Eventually, it becomes apparent that what was missing in Ray's life can only be addressed through baseball, and through a cultural icon from his past, played by the ubiquitous James Earl Jones.When everything is resolved, there's a bit of throwaway dialogue that, in reality, is very moving. &quot;It was you,&quot; Ray tells Shoeless Joe Jackson in reference to the voice he'd heard early in the film. &quot;No, it was YOU,&quot; Jackson replies, indicating thatRay's conscience prompted the entire adventure.

Kevin Costner stars as a suburban family man who is hearing voices. &quot;If you built it they will come&quot;. The voices keep changing their messages and lead him in pursuit of the gathering of baseball legends who have passed away. The goal is to establish a &quot;field of dreams&quot; a baseball park with old pros playing and a magic working on its audience. And it did for many people when this movie was released in 1989. Too many, it was a movie about hope, following your dreams and persistence. Kevin Costner is doing a terrific performance and is perhaps doing his greatest role. He was merely a romantic lead in the early 90's &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; with Whitney Houston and he was not as committed in &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; which though the right kind of movie for him was not as interesting enough a character as he is in this movie. Other than this movie, his only fine role was in J.F.K. In this film, he plays a dedicated and persistent dreamer who discovers that indeed dreams come true if you hold fast. A great job by all the actors, including James Earl Jones (the voice of Darth Vader in Star Wars) as the hermit and elusive author Terrence Mann, who wrote books in the 60's advocating love and peace. He is supposedly modeled after J.D. Salinger. The chemistry between James Earl Jones and Kevin Costner, especially in the scene in which Costner attempts to pursuade him to join him to a baseball game is exceptional. Magical and unexpected things start to happen as the voices carry him onward through his mission, including a trip back in time to 1972.  Bring the magic home in this remarkable DVD. It's as much an adult's movie as it is for the whole family. It's almost a Disney film.

This movie is superb and succeeds on every level.  It's a  beautiful story of hope and redemption.  Costner plays the Iowa farmer  portrayed in W. P. Kinsella's novel with just the right amount of wide-eyed  wonder mixed with a spirit of adventure. Amy Madigan is also well cast as  his wife Annie.  I only wish my wife were as indulgent of my crazy ideas.  Although I disagree with a previous customer reviewer who thoroughly  trashed this picture, I do agree with him that Tim Busfield was irritating  (as he is in virtually every movie or TV show in which I've ever seen  him).Two or three really great scenes stand out in &quot;Field of  Dreams&quot;.  James Earl Jones' speech about baseball is one of those  classic pieces of solliloquy in motion pictures that people will remember  50 years from now, right up there with &quot;here's looking at you,  kid&quot; from Casablanca.  The scene near the end of the movie where Ray  plays catch with his father is enough to bring a tear to the eye of every  man, and the wistfulness of a time gone by that Burt Lancaster shows us as  &quot;Moonlight Graham&quot; is simply elegant.I often think about  what I would personally rate as the top ten movies I've ever seen in my  life, and I have to say that the top spot on my list is a tossup between  this movie and &quot;Pleasantville&quot;.

In the novel, the game is elevated to theological status, and Kinsella's prose rises to evangelical fervor in praise of the redemptive powers of the game.  By comparison, the film is tepid, prosaic, and forced.  It's one thing to IMAGINE the heroes of yesteryear walking out of a cornfield to resume their sport, but quite another to see this event documented by a camera.

As a baseball fan, it is hard to watch this movie without some thought of the heros of the past.  The main baseball character is Shoeless Joe Jackson(Ray Liotta, mentioned also is the black sox scandal, and throughout the movie there are other references to famous ballplayers.  When you watch this movie, you also begin to realize that the field itself is a character of it's own.  You get to see where the idea came from, how it was lovingly constructed and then how it becomes so important to the plotline.  The field itself is magnificient surrounded by the fields of corn stalks.  There are even a few scenes in the movie where you may think that the sky is painted because it is too beautiful to be true.  It presents the perfectly safe place for the events of the movie to unfold.  This story is about baseball, but also about family.  It begins with a monologue from Ray Kinsella(Kevin Costner) who introduces us through a scrapbook to his family life up to the point that the story begins.  We follow this farmer through an amazing journey where he receives messages from a &quot;voice&quot; that he has to decipher and then follow.  And in the end Ray and the audience puts their meanings together. This adds a sort of mysticism to the story, where although it is truly a work of fiction, you will want to believe it could be true.  Another superb performance is turned in by James Earl Jones who is playing Terrance Mann a writer from the 60's.  The speech that he makes during the movie is truly powerful and very memorable.  Without giving away the whole movie, I just want to say that if you have any interest in baseball, or just remember playing catch with your father, please get this movie.

54259,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,0783225881,Stephanie De Pue,"[1, 3]","""Field of Dreams"" another Kevin Costner (Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves (Snap Case)) baseball movie, was originally released in 1989, and is now nearly twenty years old.  Most viewers would agree that it's held up pretty well, and is still one of the best baseball movies around.It is, of course, the story of that famous Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella (It's not heaven, it's Iowa, folks), who regrets his abrasive relationship with his late, baseball-loving, father. One day, he hears a voice telling him: ""If you build it, he will come.""  He therefore believes he's being told to plow under his prime cornfield and plant a baseball diamond.  So he does. The voice then sends him to Boston to find reclusive 1960's cult writer Terence Mann (James Earl Jones,The Great White Hope), and to Minnesota to find mysterious ""Doc"" Graham (Burt Lancaster,Elmer Gantry.)  The baseball diamond will, we know, call forth somehow, from somewhere, some historic ballplayers --principally the disgraced (for throwing the World Series, to the benefit of some notorious gamblers, including ""Funny Girl"" Fanny Brice's husband Arnie Rothstein) Chicago White Sox of 1919.  They are led by famed ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta,GoodFellas [Blu-ray]; shooting sparks in this portrayal).  Costner's character is supported in all this, despite the fact that it's driving his family into bankruptcy, by his loyal wife Annie ( Amy Madigan,Nowhere to Hide). The movie's clearly well-cast, though, after paying Jones, Lancaster, and Liotta, in addition to Costner, the producers probably weren't willing to spend big bucks on casting wifey, as well.  Nevertheless, Madigan acquits herself honorably.The film is generally considered a guy thing, and, in fact, a guys' weepie, but it ain't necessarily so.  It's crisp as a new ten dollar bill, moves at speed like a good fastball, and is, in reality, quite witty, as was noticed upon its release.  It's also got a resonant subtext.  Kinsella, we're specifically told, is actually neither a farmer, nor an Iowa native, by family background; his dad worked at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.  The Kinsellas are characterized as left over 1960's hippies,  He wears an old University of California Berkeley t-shirt, there's a peace sign on the old Volkswagen van, and Annie's big PTA speech would do any Berkeley-educated mom proud.  When Costner tracks down the Jones character, the writer sprays him with Flit, probably not distributed since the 60's, and tells him to get back to the 60's while he still can: it's a frequently-cited scene.  In Minnesota, Costner experiences a little more time travel -- he finds himself in 1972.  ""The Godfather"" is playing. And there's a poster hung by the Committee to Re-Elect the President--Nixon, that is-- giving us CREEP, of Watergate notoriety.We're told that ""Shoeless"" was forced to finish his career on a 10th rate team in Carolina, an interesting echo of Costner's other baseball movie, ""Bull Durham.""  In addition, ""Shoeless"" Joe's best speech, about that Carolina team's travel and hotel arrangements, echoes one of Costner's most-quoted ""Bull Durham"" speeches.  Finally, Madigan's character is named ""Annie,"" as is Susan Sarandon's in ""Bull Durham.""  Supposedly, ballplayers call their groupies ""Annies.""In sum, yeah, the movie's probably a guy thing.  But that ain't necessarily so bad.",3,Guy Thing?

54261,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,0783225881,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 1]","Field of Dreams (1989)Drama, Family, Fantasy, 107 minutesDirected by Phil Alden RobinsonStarring Kevin Costner, James Earl Jones and Ray LiottaHere's a movie that feels like vintage Spielberg. It was nominated for three Oscars: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Score, but failed to win. It's more of a fantasy than a drama and the viewer is required to ignore logic and any expectation of how the real world works. If you can do that, there's a chance you might end up loving Field of Dreams.The story focuses on Ray Kinsella (Costner) who runs a farm in Iowa. One day, he hears a voice whispering to him out in the cornfield. It says, ""If you build it, he will come."" That would be both worrying and annoying, I imagine. We aren't told what he has to build or who will come, but he eventually has a ""vision"" of a baseball field among the corn.Put yourself in that situation. Would you think you were losing your mind? Dare you tell anybody? Would you consider acting on it, even for a moment? Well, Ray tells his wife Annie (Amy Madigan) and she believes him. You would have to have an incredibly honest relationship to inspire that level of trust.Ray destroys part of his crop, builds the field, and somebody does come. It turns out to be Shoeless Joe Jackson (Liotta). That's amazing enough, but the voice doesn't stop. It wants something more from Ray. I won't reveal anything else about the plot as it's better to experience it for yourself.Costner was a huge star in the 80s and 90s and plays Ray very effectively. My favorite character is Terence Mann, played by James Earl Jones, and he should have been nominated for his performance. The whole cast works well and the story plays out like a wild fantasy adventure. I always find myself engrossed in the story, anxious to see what happens next, although I have watched the movie many times.Field of Dreams is nonsense, but it's heartwarming, feel-good nonsense that I will never tire of seeing.",5,"If you build it, he will come",1330473600,"02 29, 2012",2012,1966,"['Field', 'Dreams', '1989', 'Drama', 'Family', 'Fantasy', '107', 'minutesDirected', 'Phil', 'Alden', 'RobinsonStarring', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Ray', 'LiottaHere', 'movie', 'vintage', 'Spielberg', 'was', 'nominated', 'three', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Score', 'failed', 'win', 'more', 'fantasy', 'drama', 'viewer', 'required', 'ignore', 'logic', 'expectation', 'how', 'real', 'world', 'can', 'do', 'chance', 'might', 'end', 'up', 'loving', 'Field', 'Dreams.The', 'story', 'Ray', 'Kinsella', 'Costner', 'who', 'farm', 'Iowa', 'One', 'day', 'voice', 'whispering', 'out', 'cornfield', 'build', 'will', 'come', 'would', 'be', 'worrying', 'annoying', 'imagine', 'are', ""n't"", 'told', 'what', 'build', 'who', 'will', 'come', 'eventually', 'vision', 'baseball', 'field', 'corn.Put', 'situation', 'Would', 'think', 'were', 'losing', 'mind', 'Dare', 'tell', 'anybody', 'Would', 'consider', 'acting', 'even', 'moment', 'Well', 'Ray', 'wife', 'Annie', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'would', 'have', 'have', 'incredibly', 'honest', 'relationship', 'inspire', 'level', 'trust.Ray', 'destroys', 'part', 'crop', 'field', 'somebody', 'come', 'out', 'be', 'Shoeless', 'Joe', 'Jackson', 'Liotta', 'amazing', 'enough', 'voice', ""n't"", 'stop', 'something', 'more', 'Ray', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'anything', 'else', 'plot', 'better', 'experience', 'yourself.Costner', 'was', 'huge', 'star', '80s', '90s', 'plays', 'Ray', 'very', 'effectively', 'favorite', 'character', 'Terence', 'Mann', 'played', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'performance', 'whole', 'cast', 'well', 'story', 'out', 'wild', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'always', 'find', 'engrossed', 'story', 'anxious', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'many', 'times.Field', 'Dreams', 'nonsense', 'heartwarming', 'feel-good', 'nonsense', 'will', 'never', 'tire', 'seeing']",N/A

Kinsella's delicate baseball novel ""Shoeless Joe"".  On a mysterious night while working in his farm, average family man Ray Kinsella (played by Kevin Costner in a heartwarming, brilliant performance) hears the faint whispers proclaiming ""if you build it, they will come"".  Ray has no idea what this means and why he hears these voices, but he is determined to find answers to his questions.  With the guidance and support of his loving wife (Amy Madigan), Kinsella decides to use all of his family's money and land to build a beautiful baseball field-not knowing its purpose and why Ray felt he had to build it.Ray is also compelled to track down a once-famous novelist (James Earl Jones) and an unknown baseball star named ""Moonlight Graham"" (Burt Lancaster) because they are somehow connected to the spiritually enveloped ball diamond.  Seen by only himself, his family, and the novelist, Ray's field becomes the playing ground for the spirits of former ballplayers whose careers were cut short by fate and tragedy.  As Ray learns more about the purpose of the field, he continues to lose money from not growing crop.  He is on the brink of losing his land and home, but Ray is still obligated to understand his true destiny-and he believes it is the field.Kevin Costner delivers one of the defining performances of his career, capturing Kinsella in a fashion that only he could produce.  James Earl Jones is a fine choice as the cloistered activist Terrance Mann.  ""Field of Dreams"" cultivates from being a standard baseball story and becomes a miraculous metaphor for the American dream, the love for family, and the incredible bond of father and son.  It is a tale that symbolizes what is good about cinema, how movies can carry an audience into a fantasy world that we all wished we were still a part of, and brings out the child in all of us.

A fantasy played out not in an enchanted realm of dragons and faeries, but in a middle American Iowa cornfield.  Costner plays Ray Kinsella, an Iowa farmer who one day hears a voice telling him ""If you build it, they will come.""  Build what and who will come?  Well the answer is, of course, a regulation baseball diamond right in the middle of his cornfield.  Townspeople think Ray is nuts but his idealistic wife Annie (Amy Madigan) has faith in Ray.Ray continues to get new messages from the voice that leads him to Boston to track down a reclusive author Terrence Mann (James Earl Jones) where, in films funniest moment, Ray explains to Mann that he has to take him to a baseball game at Fenway Park and Ray fakes having a gun in his jacket to coerce the skeptical writer.Eventually THEY do come...spirits of deceased baseball players, right out of his cornfield to play ball on Ray's diamond, including Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta) the wrongfully banned player from the Black Sox scandal.  All the while Ray's brother in law Mark (Tim Busfield) is trying to get Ray to sell his farm before the bank forecloses on it.  Eventually, as in any mythical fairy tale, all things work out and one could end the film by saying they all lived happily ever after!Costner's ""aw shucks"" All-American boy style was perfectly suited to his role in this film.  James Earl Jones and Burt Lancaster (as Moonlight Graham) also stood out although Liotta's Jackson was a bit too refined for a guy who was supposed to be something of a country bumpkin.  This is a magnificent film and one of the best of the 1980's.This 15th anniversary release features a host of special features including a remastered anamorphic presentation of the film.

54281,A1C80B497LCYKA,0783225881,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[4, 6]","Field Of Dreams is about baseball; but baseball is just a metaphor for something bigger. It's about an Iowa farmer named Ray who hears a voice that tells him, ""If you build it, he will come."" He knows the Voice wants him to build a baseball diamond in the middle of his cornfield; which, oddly enough, he's willing to do because he thinks it will keep him from ending up like his dad - a man that ""never did one spontaneous thing in his life."" But he thinks the field is for ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson - one of the infamous eight ""Black Sox"" that were barred from baseball for life in 1920 - so he will come and play baseball again... which he does, but that's not the reason for the field.Later, Ray gets a second message that tells him, ""Ease his pain,"" which sends him off on a road trip to pick up Terence Mann - really J. D. Salinger, author of Catcher In The Rye, according to Shoeless Joe, the book on which the film is based - and a small town doctor named Archibald ""Moonlight"" Graham. Kevin Costner plays Ray, Amy Madigan plays his wife Annie, Ray Liotta play Shoeless Joe, James Earl Jones plays Terence Mann, and Burt Lancaster plays Moonlight Graham. Together they find their dreams on a baseball diamond in the middle of an Iowa cornfield. But, as wonderful as all this is, that is still not why Ray was told to build the field.At the climax of the film, Ray has to make a choice between selling his farm in order to keep from being foreclosed on, and risking everything in order to keep the baseball diamond. At that point, Terence Mann makes a little speech about what is best about America, and how baseball has marked the time throughout the years and helped keep us on track. Both he and Ray's daughter, Karin (played by Gaby Hoffmann), tell Ray that if he keeps the baseball diamond, people will come and pay to see it, and that will save the farm.But what is the baseball diamond, really? Several times, people ask, ""Is this Heaven?"" and Ray answers, ""No, it's Iowa,"" which is a funny line; but the truth is, it really IS Heaven, because it's the place where dreams come true, as Ray's dad later points out. Heaven has set down on a farm in Iowa in the form of a baseball diamond in order to redeem and heal some broken lives. Isn't that what God does? Isn't that what He did with the Tabernacle in the wilderness, with the Temple in Israel, and with Jesus in Judea? And isn't that what He's going to do one day with the New Jerusalem? He's going to set Heaven down on earth and all His people's dreams are going to come true.The heart of Field Of Dreams is Ray's relationship with his dad. He builds the baseball diamond because he's afraid of becoming like his dad. Ray and his dad didn't get along growing up: they both loved baseball, but they pulled for different teams; when Ray went off to college, he picked the one furthest away from his dad; he even told his dad he could never respect him because his hero was a criminal - Shoeless Joe. I was stupid like that once. I said and did stupid things to my dad because we didn't get along and I didn't want to end up like him. I think MOST guys feel this way, which is why this film speaks to so many of us in the place where they have our deepest pain.When the Voice says ""Ease his pain,"" at first, Ray thinks he's talking about Terence Mann, which is why he went off to find him; and near the end of the film, when he sees his dad (played by Dwier Brown) as a young man, he says, ""It was you,"" thinking that it was HIS pain he was supposed to ease. But Shoeless Joe corrects him in one of the most poignant moments in the film: ""No, Ray, it was you."" All this was done to ease Ray's pain.There's a valuable lesson here. Earlier, Shoeless Joe invites Terence Mann to go back with him and the other ballplayers to find out what's beyond the corn. Ray gets miffed because he thinks HE'S the one that should go back. After all, he built the baseball diamond, and it's his cornfield the players are living in. So he questions Shoeless Joe, asking point blank, ""What's in it for me?"" and Shoeless responds, ""Is that why you did this, Ray - for you?"" Of course, it wasn't. But he's starting to feel entitled. That's when he realizes what this whole experience has really been about.In the process of easing others' pain, he has eased his own. That is the nature of giving and self-sacrifice: ""Whoever loses his life for me will find it."" (Matthew 16:25) Whatever we lose on earth we will find in Heaven. Oh, if only we would learn this lesson in America today - it would change everything! Ray risks everything to help others, and in the process, gains everything.Throughout history, and around the world today, people are risking everything for others, and in the process, they're finding themselves and their dreams. George Mueller, William Wilberforce, Mother Theresa, people who went to New Orleans to help rebuild, people who have gone to Haiti to help there... the list is endless. These are people who either built or are building orphanages, hospitals, schools, houses, churches, sports programs, arts programs, you name it... so that others can come and find their dreams. That was once the mantra of America: if you build it, they will come. It's even written in so many words on the Stature of Liberty. Do we still believe it?There is one thing that lasts, and that is really what this movie is about: the Kingdom of Heaven. When Christ left earth and walked back into Heaven, He turned to his team and said, ""If you build it, they will come."" Build what? His Kingdom. It's not a kingdom of bricks and mortar, nor even a kingdom of baseballs and bats: it's a kingdom of relationships. Only relationships last. That's why we're here.If you ask most middle Americans what they're building, they'll say, ""A family."" But is that about Christ and His Kingdom, or is that about you? Most people see their family as an extension of themselves; but your family is really just your team. What are you and your team building? If most of us were honest, we'd have to answer, ""A kingdom of self,"" because that is what most of us are living for. Self doesn't satisfy, which is why everyone that comes to the end of themselves ends up at the throne of Christ with broken dreams, asking Him to fix them. It's not our broken dreams that Christ needs to fix, it's our broken relationships, beginning with HIm. He will give us new, better dreams, and it is those NEW dreams that will ease our pain.If we start living for Him instead of ourselves, and if we start building His Kingdom instead of our own, we will find our field of dreams. What physical talents and spiritual gifts have you been given? That is a clue as to what you should be building. Your work, whatever it is, can be a field of dreams for someone else, and, in the process, a way for your dreams to come true and your pain to be eased. It's a simple answer that has existed for two thousand years.What is the Voice telling you to build right now? If you build it, He will come. He will most definitely come.Waitsel Smith",5,Lost Dreams and the Place to Find Them,1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,7048,"['Field', 'Dreams', 'baseball', 'baseball', 'just', 'metaphor', 'something',

But after watching most of it on TV recently, I have to admit my error.  It was a lovely idea unrealized  -  corn both under- and over-cooked.  Kevin Costner's well-intentioned performance was undone either by his lack of acting chops or poor direction  -  probably both.  Amy Madigan was abrasive throughout.  The bonus/bogus characters played by Jones and Lancaster were more preposterous than the ballfield in (and of) the corn, and Lancaster's is actually embarrassing.  So we're left with Gaby Hoffmann, who, at the age of 7, could hardly be expected to save the movie, charming as she was.",2,Not All the Corn Was in the Field,1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,729,"['can', 'certainly', 'understand', 'why', 'anyone', 'might', 'be', 'taken', 'movie', 'was', 'twice', 'when', 'appeared', 'theaters', 'again', 'VHS', 'watching', 'most', 'TV', 'recently', 'have', 'admit', 'error', 'was', 'lovely', 'idea', 'unrealized', 'corn', 'under-', 'over-cooked', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'well-intentioned', 'performance', 'was', 'undone', 'either', 'lack', 'acting', 'chops', 'poor', 'direction', 'probably', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'was', 'abrasive', 'bonus/bogus', 'characters', 'played', 'Jones', 'Lancaster', 'were', 'more', 'preposterous', 'ballfield', 'corn', 'Lancaster', 'actually', 'embarrassing', ""'re"", 'left', 'Gaby', 'Hoffmann', 'who', 'age', '7', 'could', 'hardly', 'be', 'expected', 'save', 'movie', 'charming', 'was']",N/A
54283,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,0783225881,Wayne C. Rogers,"[17, 18]","I saw Field of Dreams in 1989 at the theater with my wife and cried my eyes out at the end of it.  She thought I was totally crazy and freaked out over the tears that I was shedding over a movie about baseball.  When she asked me what was wrong, I didn't know what to say because I had no control over the tears that were flowing.  It surprised me as much as it did her.  I've since seen Field of Dreams about twenty-five times, and it's now an American classic.  I no longer break out in tears when viewing the film, but my eyes still get kind of watery for the magic of the movie hasn't diminished with time.  It's just as powerful now as it was eighteen years ago.As all of you probably know by now, Field of Dreams deals with an Iowa farmer named Ray Kinsella (played wonderfully by Kevin Costner), who hears a mysterious voice in his cornfield one day, saying the famous words, ""If you build it, he will come.""  Since Ray's the only person who can hear the voice, he has to wonder if maybe he's going just a little bit crazy.  As the movie progresses, Ray decides to do what the ""voice"" wants and plows under a third of his major crop so that he can build a baseball diamond for no apparent reason.  Now, everybody in town thinks he's absolutely nuts. His wife, Annie (played by Amy Madigan), sticks by him through thick and thin, but she does worry about how all the mounting bills are going to get paid.  In time, however, the ghosts of baseball players from the past appear from out of the cornfield to play on this rather unique ball diamond, including the legendary ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson (played by Ray Liotta in one of his first acting roles).  The catch here is that only Ray and his family can see the ghosts.  With the bank threatening to foreclose on the farm, the ""voice"" tells Ray to go on a long journey to get a reclusive novelist, Terence Mann (played by James Earl Jones), who lives in Boston and an elderly doctor, Archibald ""Moonlight"" Graham (played by the late Burt Lancaster), who lives in Minnesota, and to bring them both back to the ball field.  What happens after that is for the viewer to find out as the film delves into the emotional need for a special ""reunion"" and the sheer magic of making your dreams come true.Let me just say that at the end of the film, the camera rises up to show hundreds of cars approaching the Kinsella farm at night, which is poetic in that it eventually happened in real life.  Since 1989, over a million people from all over the world have visited the real Field of Dreams, which is located on the eastern side of Iowa about seven miles outside of Dyersville.  This movie not only touched my heart, but evidently the hearts of millions of others.  It was even nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture of 1989.  I consider this film to be # 1 on my personal top-10 list because it not only deals with the reunion of father and son, but the possibility that you can actually make your dreams come true if you believe in yourself.  This special two-disc anniversary edition is definitely worth the upgrade.  I spent the money without a second thought.  The first disc contains the complete theatrical release, plus a full-length commentary by its director, Phil Alden Robinson, and the director of photography, John Lindley.  The second disc contains a number of featurettes.  The first is a thirty-minute get together between Kevin Costner and three baseball stars, Bret Saberhagen, Johnny Bench, and George Brett.  They watch the movie at Kevin's house and then discuss their careers in baseball, their sons, and how the movie has affected their lives.  The second feature is a look at Galena, Illinois, which was used in the movie to represent the small city where ""Moonlight"" Graham lived--Chisholm, Minnesota.  The third feature is a look at the real Field of Dreams outside of Dyersville, Iowa, and how it's grown since its construction in 1988.  This is a great little documentary that discusses how this magical field has affected the hundreds of thousands of people who have visited it over the last fifteen years.  The fourth feature is the Bravo show: From Page to Script, which deals with the novel, Field of Dreams, and how it was turned into an Academy Award nominated movie.  If you love the film, you're going to enjoy this fifty-minute documentary.  You finally get to meet the author of the book, William Kinsella, and to hear how the director, Phil Alden Robinson, began to doubt himself during the making of the film.  All in all, this is a very special movie with wonderful behind-the-scenes stuff that certainly adds to the enjoyment of the movie.  As Phil Robinson says, though the film didn't win Best Picture of 1989, it turned out to be a movie that literally changes people's lives for the better.  That's the big reward for him.

I kind of rolled my eyes because I wasn't too keen on Kevin Costner but I said okay, lets do it, so she advised me to shut up while the opening credits rolled because it gave some background about the life of the characters so I did just that and for the rest of the entire movie, I was hooked, not only with the movie itself but the music.Please note though, that, while being catholic, I am not a very religious minded person and my thoughts about the spiritual aspects of this movie I will leave out of this review.The Theme of the movie itself is what sold me on it, the relationship that the Costner Character, Ray Kinsella, had with his father in the movie, now, I, myself, had a great relationship with my father and all during the movie, I was rooting for Ray to somehow reconnect with his father again and by the end of this picture, without giving it away, I was a mess, This movie, in one viewing, made it's way into my top ten all time favorite movies.Not only that but I immediately upon leaving my friends house, went to the store and purchased the video AND the soundtrack and it was one of the first DVD's I purchased after I got my first DVD player.I read other reviews here that panned the movie for lousy acting and terrible story lines but I think this was a wonderful movie and I agree with one reviewer that this is ""It's a wonderful life"" on a baseball diamond, which so happens to be another favorite of mine.

Eichelberger ""I will not go quietly""","[1, 1]","I'm always amazed when I hear baseball fans complain about this movie, and believe me it happens every spring.  Good sports movies are few and far between, and I'd stick Field Of Dreams out at the front of the pack along with Bull Durham and Hoosiers, (with the slight overall edge to Hoosiers.)  The Field Of Dreams story has been rehashed often enough in these reviews, so I'll spare you my take on it, but I have to say that the cast is what takes a pretty good story and makes it into a great movie.  Only Costner's Dances With Wolves performance tops this one.  James Earl Jones is likewise incredible as the sixties burn-out, as is Amy Madigan as the hippy burn-out.  Honestly there isn't a weak performance in the movie, and if the Fenway Park scenes don't make you book a trip to Boston, you shouldn't call yourself a baseball fan.",5,One of a handful of great baseball movies,1078358400,"03 4, 2004",2004,839,"[""'m"", 'always', 'amazed', 'when', 'hear', 'baseball', 'fans', 'complain', 'movie', 'believe', 'spring', 'Good', 'sports', 'movies', 'are', 'few', 'far', ""'d"", 'stick', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'out', 'front', 'pack', 'Bull', 'Durham', 'Hoosiers', 'slight', 'overall', 'edge', 'Hoosiers', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'story', 'been', 'rehashed', 'often', 'enough', 'reviews', ""'ll"", 'spare', 'take', 'have', 'say', 'cast', 'what', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'great', 'movie', 'Only', 'Costner', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'performance', 'one', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'likewise', 'incredible', 'sixties', 'burn-out', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'hippy', 'burn-out', 'Honestly', ""n't"", 'weak', 'performance', 'movie', 'Fenway', 'Park', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'book', 'trip', 'Boston', 'should', ""n't"", 'call', 'baseball', 'fan']",N/A
54289,AP3B615GM191G,0783225881,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 2]","When it comes to baseball, the National Pastime is probably the most romantic of all the major sports.  Because of its long, rich history and the fact that is has been passed down from generation to generation, it is shrouded in a sort of mysticism/nostalgia that gives the sport a sort of romantic glean.  ""Field of Dreams"" takes full advantage of this mystique to create the greatest baseball stories ever told.For a basic plot summary, the movie tells the story of Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner), an Iowa corn farmer who begins hearing voices out in the cornfield.  These voices, to the chagrin of wife Annie (Amy Madigan), tell Ray to build a baseball diamond in the middle of his cornfield in order to bring back the ghost of Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta).  In the face of deep financial peril, Ray builds the field and holds onto the dream, along the way bringing in famous 1960s writer Terence Mann (James Earl Jones) and Archie ""Moonlight"" Graham (Burt Lancaster) to share in the incredible experience.This film has a solid plot and great acting.  Every scene means something (a credit to director Phil Robinson), and the plot builds to an extraordinary climax.  However, it is the emotion of the experience that makes it an all-time classic.  Baseball can create a strong bond between fathers & sons, families, and friends, and ""Field of Dreams"" is absolutely perfect at creating a rich tapestry of emotion.  I don't care how ""tough"" you are or how emotionally reserved you may be...if this one can't touch you, then you might want to check to make sure you aren't a robot.Overall, I consider ""Field of Dreams"" to be the greatest baseball movie ever made.  It truly ""gets"" the concept of the romantic, nostalgic side of baseball, and adds such heaping amounts of emotion that one can't help but get sucked into the whole experience.  In terms of ""greatest single scenes"" in Hollywood history, the ending of this flick is perhaps my favorite ever.  Pure, raw emotion at its very finest.",5,The Greatest Baseball Movie Ever Made,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,1996,"['When', 'baseball', 'National', 'Pastime', 'probably', 'most', 'romantic', 'major', 'sports', 'long', 'rich', 'history', 'fact', 'been', 'passed', 'generation', 'generation', 'shrouded', 'sort', 'mysticism/nostalgia', 'sport', 'sort', 'romantic', 'glean', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'full', 'advantage', 'mystique', 'create', 'greatest', 'baseball', 'stories', 'ever', 'told.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'movie', 'story', 'Ray', 'Kinsella', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Iowa', 'corn', 'farmer', 'who', 'hearing', 'voices', 'out', 'cornfield', 'voices', 'chagrin', 'wife', 'Annie', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'tell', 'Ray', 'build', 'baseball', 'diamond', 'middle', 'cornfield', 'order', 'bring', 'back', 'ghost', 'Shoeless', 'Joe', 'Jackson', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'face', 'deep', 'financial', 'peril', 'Ray', 'field', 'dream', 'way', 'bringing', 'famous', '1960s', 'writer', 'Terence', 'Mann', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Archie', 'Moonlight', 'Graham', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'share', 'incredible', 'experience.This', 'film', 'solid', 'plot', 'great', 'acting', 'Every', 'scene', 'something', 'credit', 'director', 'Phil', 'Robinson', 'plot', 'extraordinary', 'climax', 'However', 'emotion', 'experience', 'all-time', 'classic', 'can', 'create', 'strong', 'bond', 'fathers', 'sons', 'families', 'friends', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'creating', 'rich', 'tapestry', 'emotion', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'tough', 'are', 'how', 'emotionally', 'reserved', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'touch', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'make', 'sure', 'are', ""n't"", 'robot.Overall', 'consider', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'be', 'greatest', 'baseball', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'truly', 'concept', 'romantic', 'nostalgic', 'side', 'baseball', 'such', 'heaping', 'amounts', 'emotion', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'sucked', 'whole', 'experience', 'terms', 'greatest', 'single', 'scenes', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'ending', 'flick', 'perhaps', 'favorite', 'ever', 'Pure', 'raw', 'emotion', 'very', 'finest']",N/A
