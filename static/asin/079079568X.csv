121954,A2IVCG4IILTY6O,079079568X,"abt1950 ""abt1950""","[5, 5]","Tennesee Williams' ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" is a powerful play and here has been made into a powerful film.  Family ties, lies, power, money, death, sexual troubles and even sibling rivalry coalesce as the troubled Pollitt family deals with the terminal illness of its patriarch.  Although the gay subtext has been muted to fit 1950's sensitibilities, it's still there, adding resonance to the film.  There's a bit of the mannered approach common to movies of the period, which gives the film a more theatrical feel than many movie adaptations of plays.  In some ways, ""Cat"" comes across as an early, Southern version of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf.""The acting in this film is superb, if a little over-the-top at times.  ""Maggie the Cat"" is a plum dramatic role, and Elizabeth Taylor more than does it justice.  In her hands, Maggie's basic humanity alternates with her greed to eventually define her. Paul Newman likewise turns in an excellent performance as the troubled Brick.  Burl Ives steals the show as Big Daddy, the larger-than-life dying patriarch.  Jack Carson and Madelaine Sherwood play the elder, less-favored son and his fecund wife, Mae. Mae and her brood are played as wonderfully grotesque charicatures, greatly enhancing the oppressive atmosphere of the film.  If you think of Diane Arbus shooting a movie, you'll get an excellent idea of what Mae and her little ""no-neck monsters"" are like.",4,Strong stuff for its day.

121956,AGEIT17HENDIS,079079568X,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","The first couple of paragraphs here have been used as introduction to other plays written by Tennessee Williams and reviewed in this space. This review applies to both the stage play and the film versions with differences noted as part of the reviewPerhaps, as is the case with this reviewer, if you have come to the works of the excellent American playwright Tennessee Williams through adaptations of his plays to commercially distributed film you too will have missed some of the more controversial and intriguing aspects of his plays that had placed him at that time along with Eugene O'Neill and Arthur Miller as America's finest serious playwrights.  Although some of the films have their own charms I want to address the written plays in this entry first (along with, when appropriate, commentary about Williams' extensive and detailed directing instructions).That said, there are certain limitations for a political commentator like this reviewer on the works of Williams. Although his plays, at least his best and most well-known ones, take place in the steamy South or its environs, there is virtually no acknowledgement of the race question that dominated Southern life during the period of the plays; and, for that matter was beginning to dominate national life. Thus, although it is possible to pay homage to his work on its artistic merits, I am very, very tentative about giving fulsome praise to that work on its political merits. With that proviso Williams nevertheless has created a very modern stage on which to address social questions at the personal level, like homosexuality, incest and the dysfunctional family that only began to get addressed widely well after his ground-breaking work hit the stage.""Cat On A Hot Tin Roof"" is a prime example of the contradiction that a radical commentator is placed in. The themes of duplicity, latent homosexuality, adultery and  dysfunctional families topped off by more than enough mendacity to sink a ship are the stuff of social drama that NEED to be addressed as outcomes in the modern capitalist cultural sphere. However, in the end nothing really gets resolved truthfully here. Old 1950's-style All-American boy Brick, the `great white hope' of the family, may or may not sober up after the `lost' of his dear friend and fellow football player, Skipper. Saucy and sexy wife Maggie (the cat) may or may not really get pregnant by Brick and save the family heritage for him, or die trying. The only certainty, despite all that above-mentioned mendacity, is that Big Daddy is going to die and that 28,000 acres of the finest land in the Delta is going to need new management, either Brick, brother Goober (along with his scheming wife and their `lovely brood' of children) or some upstart. Off of these possible outcomes, however, I would not get too worked up about the final outcome.In the movie version, done in the 1950's as well,  which starred the recently departed excellent actor Paul Newman as Brick and a fetching Elizabeth Taylor as Maggie the question of Brick's possible homosexual relationship with Skipper is far more muted than in the play. The implicit question seems to concern Brick's fading youth, his search for perfect meaning to life in Mississippi and that one's existential crisis can be eliminated by reliance on the bottle.  The relationship between the dying Big Daddy and his ever suffering wife, Big Mama, is less dastardly than in the play as well. The scheming Goober and wife and family and those `lovely' children, however, run true to form. My sense of the movie, unlike the deeper issues of the play, is that a few therapy sessions would put old Brick back on the right track. The play was far less hopeful in that regard.",4,Enough Mendacity to Sink A Ship,1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,3722,"['first', 'couple', 'paragraphs', 'here', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'introduction', 'other', 'plays', 'written', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'reviewed', 'space', 'review', 'both', 'stage', 'play', 'film', 'versions', 'differences', 'noted', 'part', 'reviewPerhaps', 'case', 'reviewer', 'have', 'come', 'works', 'excellent', 'American', 'playwright', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'adaptations', 'plays', 'commercially', 'distributed', 'film', 'too', 'will', 'have', 'missed', 'more', 'controversial', 'intriguing', 'aspects', 'plays', 'had', 'placed', 'time', 'Eugene', ""O'Neill"", 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'America', 'finest', 'serious', 'playwrights', 'films', 'have', 'own', 'charms', 'want', 'address', 'written', 'plays', 'entry', 'first', 'when', 'appropriate', 'commentary', 'Williams', 'extensive', 'detailed', 'directing', 'instructions', 'said', 'are', 'certain', 'limitations', 'political', 'commentator', 'reviewer', 'works', 'Williams', 'plays', 'least', 'best', 'most', 'well-known', 'ones', 'take', 'place', 'steamy', 'South', 'environs', 'virtually', 'acknowledgement', 'race', 'question', 'dominated', 'Southern', 'life', 'period', 'plays', 'matter', 'was', 'beginning', 'dominate', 'national', 'life', 'Thus', 'possible', 'pay', 'homage', 'work', 'artistic', 'merits', 'am', 'very', 'very', 'tentative', 'giving', 'fulsome', 'praise', 'work', 'political', 'merits', 'proviso', 'Williams', 'nevertheless', 'created', 'very', 'modern', 'stage', 'address', 'social', 'questions', 'personal', 'level', 'homosexuality', 'incest', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'only', 'began', 'get', 'addressed', 'widely', 'well', 'ground-breaking', 'work', 'hit', 'stage', 'Cat', 'A', 'Hot', 'Tin', 'Roof', 'prime', 'example', 'contradiction', 'radical', 'commentator', 'placed', 'themes', 'duplicity', 'latent', 'homosexuality', 'adultery', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'topped', 'off', 'more', 'enough', 'mendacity', 'sink', 'ship', 'are', 'stuff', 'social', 'drama', 'NEED', 'be', 'addressed', 'outcomes', 'modern', 'capitalist', 'cultural', 'sphere', 'However', 'end', 'nothing', 'really', 'resolved', 'truthfully', 'here', 'Old', ""1950's-style"", 'All-American', 'boy', 'Brick', 'great', 'white', 'hope', 'family', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'sober', 'up', 'lost', 'dear', 'friend', 'fellow', 'football', 'player', 'Skipper', 'Saucy', 'sexy', 'wife', 'Maggie', 'cat', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'really', 'get', 'pregnant', 'Brick', 'save', 'family', 'heritage', 'die', 'trying', 'only', 'certainty', 'above-mentioned', 'mendacity', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'going', 'die', '28,000', 'acres', 'finest', 'land', 'Delta', 'going', 'need', 'new', 'management', 'Brick', 'brother', 'Goober', 'scheming', 'wife', 'lovely', 'brood', 'children', 'upstart', 'possible', 'outcomes', 'however', 'would', 'not', 'get', 'too', 'worked', 'up', 'final', 'outcome.In', 'movie', 'version', 'done', '1950', 'as', 'well', 'starred', 'recently', 'departed', 'excellent', 'actor', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Brick', 'fetching', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Maggie', 'question', 'Brick', 'possible', 'homosexual', 'relationship', 'Skipper', 'far', 'more', 'muted', 'play', 'implicit', 'question', 'concern', 'Brick', 'fading', 'youth', 'search', 'perfect', 'meaning', 'life', 'Mississippi', 'one', 'existential', 'crisis', 'can', 'be', 'eliminated', 'reliance', 'bottle', 'relationship', 'dying', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'ever', 'suffering', 'wife', 'Big', 'Mama', 'less', 'dastardly', 'play', 'as', 'well', 'scheming', 'Goober', 'wife', 'family', 'lovely', 'children', 'however', 'run', 'true', 'form', 'sense', 'movie', 'deeper', 'issues', 'play', 'few', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'would', 'put', 'old', 'Brick', 'back', 'right', 'track', 'play', 'was', 'far', 'less', 'hopeful', 'regard']",Cat on a Hot Tin Roof
121957,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,079079568X,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[3, 3]","""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" is a remarkable,steamy drama of a Southern dysfunctional family starring the late,great Paul Newman as former football champion Brick, Elizabeth Taylor as his sensual wife Maggie,and Burl Ives as Big Daddy. ""Cat"" has a seemingly simple premise. Brick is injured,impotent,and alcoholic. His wife, Maggie, longs for children. In the meantime, Big Daddy is dying from cancer, and there's a battle over the family fortune.Newman and Taylor are superb as the leads. Their fights sizzle, and there's genuine chemistry between them. They're an incredibly attractive couple. Newman shines as Brick,drowned in grief (as well as alcohol) for his friend Skipper and longing for paternal love. In the original play, Brick's longing for Skipper was more overtly homoerotic, but in the movie, it's toned down considerably. Still, the movie hints at why Brick lacks the ability to ""do it"" with his beautiful wife.""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" is a classic movie about family dynamics, marriage, repressed homosexuality, and paternal love. It's timeless in its themes.Paul Newman was one of the great actors of our time. He brought a nobility and masculinity to the silver screen. He will be remembered- not only as a superb actor- but as a great humanitarian as well. May he rest in peace.

121958,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,079079568X,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","Reviewing `The Hustler' brought to mind the fact that I have as of yet to review `Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' and so I decided to go ahead and get this ball rolling.  As I mentioned with `The Hustler', what impresses me most about the actor that was Paul Newman was his ability to compliment and support all of his co-stars.  Sure, he was a force and an immediate attention grabber, but instead of being greedy for the limelight he always allowed his co-stars to soak up his natural charm and charisma.  This paid off in spades, for the performances given by (especially) his leading ladies is almost always best in show.In other words; Elizabeth Taylor is beyond marvelous in this movie.The film tells the story of a very wealthy family, or at least a very wealthy patriarch named Harvey Pollitt, affectionately known as `Big Daddy'.  It becomes known to Harvey's sons that he is close to death and so his boys Cooper and Brick make their way to their father's estate to celebrate his birthday and quarrel over his estate.  Brick is a washed up football player who has drowned his sorrows in alcoholic and resorted to resenting his wife Maggie.  Cooper is the responsible yet resentful son; the one who always tried the hardest yet fell short of daddy's expectations.  His nagging wife Mae Flynn is determined to win over Big Daddy's heart and his money.When word is given that Big Daddy may not be dying after all this causes a big stir in the family as tensions mount and Big Daddy himself decides to weigh in heavy on his two sons, their wives and their `issues'.`Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' (a saying that refers to the predicament Maggie feels she has found herself) is taken from a stage play, and that may be my one and only complaint with this film.  At times it carries a stiffness that only seems to come from stage-to-screen adaptations.  It is minute and sparse, but to say it isn't there would be a bold-faced-lie.  It doesn't take away much from the film, and it is not really worth mentioning, but I feel compelled to at least bring it out.There is so much good here that the one sore spot becomes forgettable.  The script is wonderful, truly engaging and deeply sincere.  The development of relationships, especially between Maggie and Brick, is flawlessly crafted.  Cooper and Mae Flynn feel like slight clich&eacute;s, I have to be honest, but they help add layers to Brick, Maggie and even Big Daddy.  There are few films that really grapple the realities of marriage with such blunt honesty, but the relationship between Brick and Maggie (""we occupy the same cage"") is so pure I felt such a deep connection.  The film broaches much more than marital relationships but approaches the subject of fatherly affection with candor and honesty.  As Brick breaks down towards the end of the film we can see how the relationship between father and son is much more important than some give heed to.The performances by the entire cast really raise the bar here as well.  Newman and Ives are magnetic as they spar with one another, but it is Elizabeth Taylor who just dominates this film from start to finish.  Her vulnerability and unwavering devotion is just effortlessly captivating.  You bleed for her character and strive for her to find her happiness, one way or another.Richard Brooks (who also directed the gloomier yet equally impressive `In Cold Blood') delivers a fantastic film that is very well crafted and marvelously fleshed out, giving the audience much to appreciate and adore.  If you are looking for a tense family drama then look no further, for there are few as rewarding as this one.",5,This roof is mighty hot...,1228694400,"12 8, 2008",2008,3605,"['Reviewing', 'Hustler', 'brought', 'mind', 'fact', 'have', 'yet', 'review', 'Cat', 'Hot', 'Tin', 'Roof', 'so', 'decided', 'go', 'ahead', 'get', 'ball', 'rolling', 'mentioned', 'Hustler', 'what', 'most', 'actor', 'was', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'was', 'ability', 'compliment', 'support', 'co-stars', 'Sure', 'was', 'force', 'immediate', 'attention', 'grabber', 'instead', 'being', 'greedy', 'limelight', 'always', 'allowed', 'co-stars', 'soak', 'up', 'natural', 'charm', 'charisma', 'paid', 'off', 'spades', 'performances', 'given', 'especially', 'leading', 'ladies', 'almost', 'always', 'best', 'show.In', 'other', 'words', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'marvelous', 'movie.The', 'film', 'story', 'very', 'wealthy', 'family', 'least', 'very', 'wealthy', 'patriarch', 'named', 'Harvey', 'Pollitt', 'affectionately', 'known', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'known', 'Harvey', 'sons', 'close', 'death', 'so', 'boys', 'Cooper', 'Brick', 'make', 'way', 'father', 'estate', 'celebrate', 'birthday', 'quarrel', 'estate', 'Brick', 'washed', 'up', 'football', 'player', 'who', 'drowned', 'sorrows', 'alcoholic', 'resorted', 'resenting', 'wife', 'Maggie', 'Cooper', 'responsible', 'yet', 'resentful', 'son', 'one', 'who', 'always', 'tried', 'hardest', 'yet', 'fell', 'short', 'daddy', 'expectations', 'nagging', 'wife', 'Mae', 'Flynn', 'determined', 'win', 'over', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'heart', 'money.When', 'word', 'given', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'dying', 'big', 'stir', 'family', 'tensions', 'mount', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'weigh', 'heavy', 'two', 'sons', 'wives', ""issues'."", 'Cat', 'Hot', 'Tin', 'Roof', 'saying', 'refers', 'predicament', 'Maggie', 'found', 'taken', 'stage', 'play', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'only', 'complaint', 'film', 'times', 'stiffness', 'only', 'come', 'stage-to-screen', 'adaptations', 'minute', 'sparse', 'say', ""n't"", 'would', 'be', 'bold-faced-lie', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'much', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'feel', 'compelled', 'least', 'bring', 'so', 'much', 'good', 'here', 'one', 'sore', 'spot', 'forgettable', 'script', 'wonderful', 'truly', 'engaging', 'deeply', 'sincere', 'development', 'relationships', 'especially', 'Maggie', 'Brick', 'flawlessly', 'crafted', 'Cooper', 'Mae', 'Flynn', 'feel', 'slight', 'clich', 'eacute', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'help', 'add', 'layers', 'Brick', 'Maggie', 'even', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'really', 'realities', 'marriage', 'such', 'blunt', 'honesty', 'relationship', 'Brick', 'Maggie', 'occupy', 'same', 'cage', 'so', 'pure', 'felt', 'deep', 'connection', 'film', 'broaches', 'much', 'more', 'marital', 'relationships', 'subject', 'fatherly', 'affection', 'candor', 'honesty', 'Brick', 'down', 'towards', 'end', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'relationship', 'father', 'son', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'give', 'heed', 'to.The', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'really', 'raise', 'bar', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Newman', 'Ives', 'are', 'magnetic', 'spar', 'one', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'who', 'just', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'vulnerability', 'unwavering', 'devotion', 'just', 'effortlessly', 'captivating', 'bleed', 'character', 'strive', 'find', 'happiness', 'one', 'way', 'another.Richard', 'Brooks', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'gloomier', 'yet', 'equally', 'impressive', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'fantastic', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'crafted', 'marvelously', 'fleshed', 'out', 'giving', 'audience', 'much', 'appreciate', 'adore', 'are', 'looking', 'tense', 'family', 'drama', 'then', 'look', 'further', 'are', 'few', 'rewarding', 'one']",Cat on a Hot Tin Roof

Further, this perhaps one of the strongest pieces of character driven narrative in cinema history.  Based on the play of the same name, written and directed by Tennessee Williams, the film originally caught heat: first from being based of a Williams play, but also the topic issues of drug and alcohol abuse among the upper class of society, possible homosexuality, racial, gender, and southern cultural stereotypes; kitsch elements from the era.  Rather than detract from the experience, the critical layers that can be discovered in this film only enrich the experience further.The plot of the film revolves around the concept of truth and its effects when revealed and when hidden.  As such, no single character is absolutely right: every character must go through, in some sense, some form of transformation.  These revolve around accepting truth for what it was and not what others claim, or speaking it when the outcome will lead to harm or tension.  As such, truth acts as the primary motivation through the film; it discovery and results of processing it acting as the moment making moments in the film.Do not look for the good or rotten character in this film.  Everyone does something rotten and for a solid minute you will find a reason to distrust or dislike every character who crosses the screen.  This is, in my opinion, Liz Taylor's best role.  Even though I'm not an expert on the actress, I do know that the kind of stylized southern accent she sharply drawls with could only be done by her. Combined with her legendary beauty, she is nothing if not exciting.  Paul Newman's performance is beyond par; not only putting on an effective limp for the whole of the production, but also playing his aloofness to the point of harm.  Burl Ives, known more for his voice than his acting, portrays one of the great cinematic barons, drawn in part from characters like Charles Kane (certain references are even made directing the viewer to this notion).  He is powerful and capable of being powerless, the builders of empires and the broken man.The cinematography and editing are for a generation with a longer attention span.  While not exploring Kubriekien levels of unbroken shots, most of the film occurs in single rooms, often dealing with two peoples conversations.  Nothing especially is done with set design, although wardrobe and make does a spectacular job of establishing the visual presence of each character.

Alcoholism, suppressed sexual yearnings, latent homosexuality, greed, ""mendacity"" and children who could be poster kids for the pro-choice lobby are all here, and a riveting cast combine to make this triumphant film a classic. Headed by a sultry Elizabeth Taylor as the sexually frustrated and angry Maggie the Cat and Paul Newman as her alcoholic and closeted gay husband, Brick, ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" explores the interpersonal traumas among husband and wife and a former acquaintance, Skipper, a washed up football player who throws himself out of a window in a Chicago hotel, and the impact his suicide has on Maggie and Brick's marriage. The hint of a gay atrraction between Brick and Skipper is obvious, and Maggie's anger at the physical and emotional distance imposed by her husband is magnificently projected. At the same time, in an overpowering performance by Ives, Big Daddy has to come to terms with his own mortality while baiting the wolves with his decision about who'll get what of his filthy rich estate. In the end, ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" is less a snapshot of a seriously dysfunctional family at a major crossroad and more an affirmation of life, the passion for it and coming to terms with the sometimes vicious pitches life can throw. As Maggie, Elizabeth Taylor is spellbinding, and her performance is all the more credible considering the filming of the movie was interrupted by the death in a plan crash of her third husband, Mike Todd. Paul Newman, as the cynical, alcoholic and sexually ashamed Brick, unleashes a performance worthy of an Oscar, and Burl Ives is no less than commanding with an awesome screen presence.

Slipman,"[3, 4]","Superior and passionate acting performances highlight this screen adaptation of an award winning Tennessee Williams play.Burl Ives is magnificent as self made multi millionaire and patriarch of a Southern plantation empire, ""Big Daddy"" Pollitt.  He has just returned home from a medical clinic where although he doesn't yet know it, is dying from terminal cancer.  His family, except for mom Ida, aware of the prognosis has descended on the palatial family mansion to celebrate Big Daddy's 65th and ostensibly final birthday.Paul Newman, the youngest son Brick, is an alcoholic ex football star and sports announcer.  He and his wife Maggie, ""the Cat"" played by a ravishing Elizabeth Taylor make a stunning couple.  Newman however detests his wife and rejects her sexuality believing her to have had an affair with his best friend Skipper.  Feeling himself to be a failure, he drowns away his sorrow with a bottle.He is filled with guilt as a result of the suicide of his friend and fellow footballer Skipper, refusing to come to his aid.  Both Newman and Taylor were deservedly nominated for Oscars for their portrayals.  Although Ives was equally deserving, he nonetheless won an Oscar that year for his role in ""The Big Country"".The dim witted eldest son Gooper played by Jack Carson and his loudmouthed porcine wife Mae played by Madeleine Sherwood have arrived with five obnoxious kids in tow, to carve up the Pollitt empire upon Big Daddy's demise.  They all must break the bad news to the airheaded ""Big Momma"" Ida played nicely by Judith Anderson.Newman, the son favored by Ives, has never gotten along with his father.  Ives, while an excellent provider has always relished in his role as the boss, never showing love to his family.  This has been all the sensitive Newman has ever craved.  In a poignant scene in the basement of the mansion, father and son are finally able to talk and reveal their innermost feelings.  Despite the revelation of Ives' doom both father and son gain new insight into each other and begin to forge a relationship anew.  Newman also rekindles affection for his attention starved wife Maggie.Richard Brooks did a wonderful directing job in adapting this emotionally charged play into a very effective movie.

This movie, a hugely popular adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play, has lots going for it - a star-making role for Paul Newman and a memorable turn for Elizabeth Taylor as well as Burl Ives repeating his stage role as Big Daddy. Yet it falls short of being the Williams classic as presented on the stage.Now, put that fact -- it's not the play -- out of your mind and sit back and enjoy a wonderful cast spin a great story. If they censors had had their way, it would have been put off for filming for at least a decade more. The play was just too adult for the 1950s, when the movies were still being made for audiences of all ages and all sensibilities.That was the problem facing writer-director Richard Brooks: how to film a story with a gay theme without the gay theme. As explained in the new book ""Tough as Nails: The Life and Films of Richard Brooks"" (available from amazon.com), the Production Code censors at the time forbid ""sexual perversion"" (that meant gay) in American movies. Indeed, just why isn't Brick sleeping with Maggie the Cat?Well, Brooks rewrote that aspect of the play. He made it a father-son issue rather than one of sexual identity. Sure, lots of people knew what was really going on when they went to the movie - the play had been a sensation - and they accepted the movie version for what it was: a typically watered-down Hollywood treatment of adult subject matter.Tennessee Williams didn't like that and he didn't like Taylor, whom he thought was no actress. But Williams did like getting $500,000 for the movie rights and a share of the box office from one of the biggest hits in Hollywood history at that time.Burl Ives won the Oscar for supporting actor that year - not for Big Daddy but for playing a similarly larger-than-life father figure in the William Wyler western ""The Big Country.""

121985,A3A03ETOTJRR0T,079079568X,DonnaReviews,"[7, 12]","""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" is a magnificently-acted 1958 film that drips not only with Southern heat and repressed desire, but also with misogyny.  The original script from Tennessee Williams was evidently toned down, although the steaminess is intact (largely due to the presence of the gorgeous Elizabeth Taylor as Maggie the Cat).  The dynamic film is a portrait of a dying wealthy plantation owner, Big Daddy (a commanding and superb Burl Ives), and his troubled greedy family, all coming together in dysfunctional glory for Big Daddy's 65th birthday.Taylor is in the absurd position (given her ripe sexuality and looks) of being sexually rejected by her surly husband, aptly named ""Brick"" (Paul Newman), an ex-football hero whose leg is in a cast; he also repeatedly berates and verbally abuses her ostensibly because he blames her for a rumored affair with and the subsequent suicide of his friend Skipper.  The latent homosexuality in regard to Brick's relationship with Skipper remains unexpressed subtext.  With or without that insight into his character, he remains, to my mind, a loathsome, raging alcoholic, incapable of even speaking with Maggie about what actually happened and using her as the repository of his own self-loathing.  Although she continues to scratch at him, trying to break beneath his stone and comports herself with fiery tenacity, she also remains sexually and emotionally tied to him.  When in one scene, she tries to force him to listen to the truth and he threatens to hit her with his crutch, I longed for her to send him packing and make room for any number of other ostensible admirers who would be happy to acquiesce to her demands.  Although Paul Newman performs admirably as Brick, his character repulsed me.  Brick seems like a more handsome yet equally brutish version of Stanley from ""Streetcar.""Aside from Brick there is Big Daddy who professes to be living with a woman for over forty years that he doesn't love.  Big Daddy wants to get to the bottom of why Brick and Maggie have no children, whereas brother Gooper (Jack Carter) has sired five ""no necks,"" as Maggie terms them, with his wife.  In the high voltage scenes, Big Daddy cuts through the ""mendacity"" crippling Newman and the family.  In spite of verbally insulting and maltreating their wives, said wives remain doggedly loyal and ready to return to Big Husband at the snap of his fingers. In the 1950's, women had few opportunities to escape loveless marriages; they were encouraged to long for marriage as part of their identity as men were invited to scorn wives and settling down as ""nooses"" around their necks.  Economic autonomy wasn't available to them; men like these remind of us why we needed the women's movement.Performances here are multi-layered, powerful and superb, particularly Taylor as Maggie the Cat.  A must-see for movie lovers with an ace cast, but also reminder of why women needed to claw out of the cage.",5,Misogyny and Pain Run Deep,1108080000,"02 11, 2005",2005,2937,"['Cat', 'Hot', 'Tin', 'Roof', 'magnificently-acted', '1958', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'Southern', 'heat', 'repressed', 'desire', 'also', 'misogyny', 'original', 'script', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'was', 'evidently', 'toned', 'down', 'steaminess', 'intact', 'largely', 'due', 'presence', 'gorgeous', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Maggie', 'Cat', 'dynamic', 'film', 'portrait', 'dying', 'wealthy', 'plantation', 'owner', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'commanding', 'superb', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'troubled', 'greedy', 'family', 'coming', 'together', 'dysfunctional', 'glory', 'Big', 'Daddy', '65th', 'birthday.Taylor', 'absurd', 'position', 'given', 'ripe', 'sexuality', 'being', 'sexually', 'rejected', 'surly', 'husband', 'aptly', 'named', 'Brick', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'ex-football', 'hero', 'leg', 'cast', 'also', 'repeatedly', 'verbally', 'ostensibly', 'rumored', 'affair', 'subsequent', 'suicide', 'friend', 'Skipper', 'latent', 'homosexuality', 'regard', 'Brick', 'relationship', 'Skipper', 'unexpressed', 'subtext', 'insight', 'character', 'mind', 'loathsome', 'raging', 'alcoholic', 'incapable', 'even', 'speaking', 'Maggie', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'using', 'repository', 'own', 'self-loathing', 'scratch', 'trying', 'break', 'stone', 'comports', 'fiery', 'tenacity', 'also', 'sexually', 'emotionally', 'tied', 'When', 'one', 'scene', 'force', 'listen', 'truth', 'hit', 'crutch', 'longed', 'send', 'packing', 'make', 'room', 'number', 'other', 'ostensible', 'admirers', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'happy', 'acquiesce', 'demands', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'admirably', 'Brick', 'character', 'repulsed', 'Brick', 'more', 'handsome', 'yet', 'equally', 'brutish', 'version', 'Stanley', 'Streetcar', 'Aside', 'Brick', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'who', 'be', 'living', 'woman', 'forty', 'years', ""n't"", 'love', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'get', 'bottom', 'why', 'Brick', 'Maggie', 'have', 'children', 'brother', 'Gooper', 'Jack', 'Carter', 'sired', 'five', 'necks', 'Maggie', 'terms', 'wife', 'high', 'voltage', 'scenes', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'mendacity', 'crippling', 'Newman', 'family', 'spite', 'verbally', 'insulting', 'maltreating', 'wives', 'said', 'wives', 'remain', 'doggedly', 'loyal', 'ready', 'return', 'Big', 'Husband', 'snap', 'fingers', '1950', 'women', 'had', 'few', 'opportunities', 'escape', 'loveless', 'marriages', 'were', 'encouraged', 'long', 'marriage', 'part', 'identity', 'men', 'were', 'invited', 'scorn', 'wives', 'settling', 'down', 'nooses', 'necks', 'Economic', 'autonomy', 'was', ""n't"", 'available', 'men', 'remind', 'why', 'needed', 'women', 'movement.Performances', 'here', 'are', 'multi-layered', 'powerful', 'superb', 'particularly', 'Taylor', 'Maggie', 'Cat', 'must-see', 'movie', 'lovers', 'ace', 'cast', 'also', 'reminder', 'why', 'women', 'needed', 'claw', 'cage']",Cat on a Hot Tin Roof

Pitched about 10 decibels too high so that the audience can confuse loud talk with superior acting, the result is more  annoying than thought-provoking or even, perish the thought, entertaining. For a screenplay that prides itself on honesty, what could be more ""mendacious"" than excising playwrite Williams' homosexual theme from the endless palaver, leaving the audience of that day and this pondering just what is Brick's problem. This is two hours of sound and fury that finally boils down to the tritest of messages-- boys need fatherly love.

The result is average at best; most of the cast seem like they are reciting their lines and not really living their part in the play. The only actor that gives a decent and solid performance is Burl Ives, as Harvey 'Big Daddy' Pollitt, especially when he makes his final confessions near the end and exposes his reality for what it is. That's when the viewers come to realize the true extent of the lies in the lives of the characters.The story as a whole is a harsh examination of human nature and a study in the hypocrisy and falsehood in the society of the fifties. The picture illustrated is quite grim; people are living unsatisfying lives, married to spouses they don't love anymore, get drunk to escape reality, see no way out of their miserable existence, when money serves as the number one motivator for their actions.

Taylor ""GFT""","[5, 10]","Being from Mississippi, and actually born in the same town as Williams himself, I have a cultural right to be extremely picky about this film, so I must begin with two down-home criticisms. A Mississippi delta accent is a very, very specific sound, and most of the cast miss it by a mile--with Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman the worst offenders of the lot. That aside, the Mississippi delta simply doesn't look like the brief bits of landscape we're allowed to see in the film, and the archetecture of the big house is also extremely unlikely for that area. So if you're actually expecting to find any sense of the region, you're out of luck. Most viewers probably won't notice these problems, but they are a drawback, for William's work is always as much about place as about character and plot, and the film's failure to accurately capture it is a diservice to both audience and creator.That said, the big problem with CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF is 1950s censorship: it simply wasn't possible to film a play about an unconciously homosexual man's inability to forgive his oversexed wife for her role in his pseudo-lover's death. As a result, the film sidesteps the entire issue and focuses on the sub-plot of just who is going to inherit Big Daddy's estate when he dies. Accents aside, the cast does quite well, with supporting players Anderson, Carson, and Sherwood particular standouts--but the end result is just so much steam without substance, well done but not particularly meaningful.",3,All Steam,1010188800,"01 5, 2002",2002,1490,"['Being', 'Mississippi', 'actually', 'born', 'same', 'town', 'Williams', 'have', 'cultural', 'right', 'be', 'extremely', 'picky', 'film', 'must', 'begin', 'two', 'down-home', 'criticisms', 'Mississippi', 'delta', 'accent', 'very', 'very', 'specific', 'sound', 'most', 'cast', 'miss', 'mile', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'worst', 'offenders', 'lot', 'aside', 'Mississippi', 'delta', 'simply', ""n't"", 'look', 'brief', 'bits', 'landscape', ""'re"", 'allowed', 'see', 'film', 'archetecture', 'big', 'house', 'also', 'extremely', 'unlikely', 'area', 'So', ""'re"", 'actually', 'expecting', 'find', 'sense', 'region', ""'re"", 'luck', 'Most', 'viewers', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'problems', 'are', 'drawback', 'William', 'work', 'always', 'as', 'much', 'place', 'character', 'plot', 'film', 'failure', 'accurately', 'capture', 'diservice', 'audience', 'creator.That', 'said', 'big', 'problem', 'CAT', 'ON', 'A', 'HOT', 'TIN', 'ROOF', '1950s', 'censorship', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'possible', 'film', 'play', 'unconciously', 'homosexual', 'man', 'inability', 'forgive', 'oversexed', 'wife', 'role', 'pseudo-lover', 'death', 'result', 'film', 'entire', 'issue', 'sub-plot', 'just', 'who', 'going', 'inherit', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'estate', 'when', 'Accents', 'aside', 'cast', 'quite', 'well', 'supporting', 'players', 'Anderson', 'Carson', 'Sherwood', 'particular', 'standouts', 'end', 'result', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'steam', 'substance', 'well', 'done', 'not', 'particularly', 'meaningful']",Cat on a Hot Tin Roof

Basically, he comes off as a spoiled child, even pretty near up to the end and in the face of his father's impending death.  I felt it was a little ridiculous.  Also the lecture he gives his father about love being more important than money.  Sorry, money is only unimportant to those who have lots of it, and even then...

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[11, 13]","This screen version of Tennessee Williams' play CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF was quite a success upon its release in 1958, earning Academy Award nominations for both Elizabeth Taylor (Maggie) and Paul Newman (Brick). Maggie and Brick are childless-- sleeping together was a requirement in those days for children to be conceived; these two do not do that anymore. Brick spends most of his time drinking while Maggie pleads for him to stop, to love her, to bed her, etc. Big Daddy (Burl Ives), who is worth about ten million dollars, at 65 is dying with cancer. His other son and daughter-in-law have reproduced themselves five times (""no-necked monsters"" according to Maggie)and have another in the oven. If Brick is to inherit some of his father's money, he needs to be both sober and a father. He and Maggie are pitted against his brother and wife. Additionally there is his relationship with his father or lack thereof. Although the word wasn't catchy in 1958, there's obviously more than enough dysfunctionality to go around here.There is also an elephant in the room bigger than Big Daddy: what really was going on between Brick and his best friend Skipper who committed suicide for unknown reasons. This adaptation of the Williams play doesn't make much sense as to their relationship. They were friends, Brick only started drinking upon Skipper's death, and now won't sleep with Maggie. Since Ms. Taylor as Maggie was at the height of her incomparable beauty in 1958, that Brick does not find her sexually attractive is difficult to comprehend, given what the audience is told. The irony of all of this is that much is made about dishonesty (""mendacity"") throughout the film. Certainly the writer here is less than forthright about what really went on between Skipper and Brick.Mr. Williams it is said did not like this film at all. He wrote the screen play for a later version that spells out that Skipper and Brick were in love with each other but that Brick rejected such a relationship, and Skipper then committed suicide. The plot at last makes sense.This version suffers from too much talk-- often loud talk; additionally the no-neck monsters are little more than caricatures of children. The film is saved, however, with the acting of Newman, Taylor and Ives, particularly Mr. Newman. It is also interesting to see how far movies have come in almost 50 years as to what can be discussed frankly by writers.",4,There's An Elephant In The Room,1154390400,"08 1, 2006",2006,2413,"['screen', 'version', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'play', 'CAT', 'ON', 'A', 'HOT', 'TIN', 'ROOF', 'was', 'quite', 'success', 'release', '1958', 'earning', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Maggie', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Brick', 'Maggie', 'Brick', 'are', 'childless', 'sleeping', 'together', 'was', 'requirement', 'days', 'children', 'be', 'conceived', 'two', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'anymore', 'Brick', 'most', 'time', 'drinking', 'Maggie', 'pleads', 'stop', 'love', 'bed', 'etc', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'who', 'worth', 'about', 'ten', 'million', 'dollars', '65', 'dying', 'cancer', 'other', 'son', 'daughter-in-law', 'have', 'reproduced', 'five', 'times', 'no-necked', 'monsters', 'according', 'Maggie', 'have', 'oven', 'Brick', 'inherit', 'father', 'money', 'be', 'sober', 'father', 'Maggie', 'are', 'pitted', 'brother', 'wife', 'Additionally', 'relationship', 'father', 'lack', 'thereof', 'word', 'was', ""n't"", 'catchy', '1958', 'obviously', 'more', 'enough', 'dysfunctionality', 'go', 'here.There', 'also', 'elephant', 'room', 'bigger', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'what', 'really', 'was', 'going', 'Brick', 'best', 'friend', 'Skipper', 'who', 'committed', 'suicide', 'unknown', 'reasons', 'adaptation', 'Williams', 'play', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'relationship', 'were', 'friends', 'Brick', 'only', 'started', 'drinking', 'Skipper', 'death', 'now', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'Maggie', 'Ms.', 'Taylor', 'Maggie', 'was', 'height', 'incomparable', 'beauty', '1958', 'Brick', 'not', 'find', 'sexually', 'attractive', 'difficult', 'comprehend', 'given', 'what', 'audience', 'told', 'irony', 'much', 'made', 'dishonesty', 'mendacity', 'film', 'Certainly', 'writer', 'here', 'less', 'forthright', 'what', 'really', 'went', 'Skipper', 'Brick.Mr', 'Williams', 'said', 'did', 'not', 'film', 'wrote', 'screen', 'play', 'later', 'version', 'out', 'Skipper', 'Brick', 'were', 'love', 'other', 'Brick', 'rejected', 'relationship', 'Skipper', 'then', 'committed', 'suicide', 'plot', 'last', 'sense.This', 'version', 'suffers', 'too', 'much', 'talk', 'often', 'loud', 'talk', 'additionally', 'no-neck', 'monsters', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'caricatures', 'children', 'film', 'saved', 'however', 'acting', 'Newman', 'Taylor', 'Ives', 'particularly', 'Mr.', 'Newman', 'also', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'almost', '50', 'years', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'discussed', 'frankly', 'writers']",Cat on a Hot Tin Roof

Paul Newman did a lot of films, but Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is a personal favorite of mine.The movie opens at a wealthy plantation in Mississippi. There's a big celebration; Harvey ""Big Daddy"" Pollitt returns home to celebrate his 65th birthday. His son Brick (Paul Newman) is married to Margaret ""Maggie the Cat"" Pollitt (Elizabeth Taylor). Brick was once a college football star before he tore a leg muscle. Now, all he has are memories, a busted ankle, a drinking habit, and a crutch.Big daddy (Burl Ives) is a big man with a ravenous appetite for food, pleasure, and fat cigars. He built up his wealth the hard way. Every scrap on his dinner table was raised on his land. He took a swamp and turned it into a pasture. But now he needs to see his son Brick. They don't speak to each other. And Big Daddy can't understand why Brick and his gorgeous wife, Margaret, don't have any kids. They've been married for three years. Margaret's a firm shapely woman and Big Daddy's not shy about his feelings. If he had been married to Margaret for three years, she'd have three kids already plus one in the oven.Brick sulks in his room all day. He won't celebrate with the rest of the family; he won't break his neck like everybody else to see Big Daddy. He rejects Margaret's advances. They have an arrangement--she sleeps on the bed, and he sleeps on the sofa.  He doesn't want anything to do with anybody. He has his coke and bourbon to keep him company. And he has his crutch to lean on.Lately, Big Daddy's been a bit under the weather. The family doctor told Big Daddy that he was OK; actually, Big Daddy is dying. But before he dies he will straighten out Brick. They need to get things out in the open. With death imminent, Big Daddy's passions have turned in a different direction: pleasure and making up with his son, Brick. They have a showdown. Big Daddy snatches away Brick's crutch: lies. Past lies. The lies he drowns in alcohol. An ex teammate named Skipper was the only person Brick believed in. Brick thought he could trust Skipper with anything in the world...Brick was wrong.Richard Brooks (Key Largo, Brute Force) adapted this 1958 film from Tennessee William's play.

It stars Elizabeth Taylor  as Maggie, rejected over and over by her alcoholic husband, Brick, played by Paul Newman. His father, Big Daddy, played by Burl Ives, has just returned to his Mississippi mansion after exploratory surgery.  There's bitter rivalry in the family as they speculate about his death.  Jack Carson plays the older son, who, with his pregnant wife, played by Madeline Sherwood and their five obnoxious children are determined to inherit Big Daddy's fortune.  But Big Daddy despises him, as he does his own wife of 40 years, Big Mama, played by Judith Anderson.As this film was originally a play, most of it is sharp and cutting dialogue, every line filled with tension and double meanings.  Close-ups reveal the artistry of the actors, all of whom are excellent.  I especially liked Burl Ives, whose performance called for a wide range of emotions, showing his vulnerability as well as his strength.  And as the characters battled with each other, the story, which I understand was rewritten to fall within the guidelines of 1950s censors, slowly revealed itself.  Some critics say this ruined this movie adaptation.  I can't comment on that because I though the story was great. Most of the film takes place inside a house and there's almost no physical action.

Big Daddy's other son, Cooper 'Gooper' Pollitt (Jack Carson) arrives at the ""festivities"" with papers drawn up to make sure he gets Big Daddy's estate instead of Brick and Brick's wife Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor).Tensions are high from the very beginning. Brick's marriage to Maggie is clearly on the rocks; he shuns her and treats her rather cruelly. There are numerous vague inferences to the possibility that Brick's ""friendship"" with his late friend ""Skipper"" might have been of a romantic nature; and therefore Brick might not want Maggie simply because he doesn't like women. However, that is left to the viewer's imagination because at the time men being more than friends was in violation of the Hayes Code. In addition, Gooper and his wife Mae (Madeleine Sherwood) have enough kids to form an army and they are desperate to make sure that they, and not Brick and Maggie, inherit Big Daddy's fortune.Questions arise almost from the start. Will Brick and Maggie ever be able to rescue their marriage--and will Brick and Big Daddy ever make peace, too? What about the fact that the family and the family doctor hiding from Big Daddy that he has terminal cancer--how will Big Daddy take this when he finds out? Will this influence Big Daddy to give his entire estate to one or the other of his two sons? Watch the film and find out answers to this and other questions!The DVD comes with two extras of note: There is a roughly ten minute retrospective about the making of the film. It was very challenging for Elizabeth Taylor to do the film because they started shooting just before her husband Mike Todd died in a plane crash. I especially liked the comments made by Madeleine Sherwood; she brings extra light to the retrospective that the historians cannot give because she was on the set with Elizabeth Taylor and they were not. The second bonus is a commentary by Tennessee Williams historian Donald Spoto.Cat On A Hot Tin Roof deserves to be an Amazon.com ""essential video."" This film features superb acting from Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman when they were still relatively early on in their careers. I highly recommend this film for fans of these actors and people who enjoy classic motion picture will cherish this DVD for years to come.",5,"taut, intense drama with unforgettable performances",1230768000,"01 1, 2009",2009,3085,"['Cat', 'A', 'Hot', 'Tin', 'Roof', 'magnificent', 'talents', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'look', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'do', 'stunning', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'plot', 'along', 'good', 'pace', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'movie', 'guts', 'should', 'be', 'mandatory', 'viewing', 'people', 'who', 'view', 'film', 'true', 'art', 'form', 'When', 'action', 'rather', 'wealthy', 'Southern', 'family', 'gathers', 'ostensibly', 'celebrate', '65th', 'birthday', 'patriarch', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Pollitt', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'However', 'real', 'reason', 'large', 'family', 'turnout', 'soon', 'made', 'very', 'clear', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'dying', 'cancer', 'members', 'family', 'want', 'get', 'control', 'estate', 'even', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'son', 'Brick', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'ex-football', 'player', 'who', 'large', 'dosages', 'self-pity', 'anger', 'tantrums', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'son', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'other', 'son', 'Cooper', ""'Gooper"", 'Pollitt', 'Jack', 'Carson', 'festivities', 'papers', 'drawn', 'up', 'make', 'sure', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'estate', 'instead', 'Brick', 'Brick', 'wife', 'Maggie', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', '.Tensions', 'are', 'high', 'very', 'beginning', 'Brick', 'marriage', 'Maggie', 'clearly', 'rocks', 'treats', 'rather', 'cruelly', 'are', 'numerous', 'vague', 'inferences', 'possibility', 'Brick', 'friendship', 'late', 'friend', 'Skipper', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'romantic', 'nature', 'therefore', 'Brick', 'might', 'not', 'want', 'Maggie', 'simply', ""n't"", 'like', 'women', 'However', 'left', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'time', 'men', 'being', 'more', 'friends', 'was', 'violation', 'Hayes', 'Code', 'addition', 'Gooper', 'wife', 'Mae', 'Madeleine', 'Sherwood', 'have', 'enough', 'kids', 'form', 'army', 'are', 'desperate', 'make', 'sure', 'not', 'Brick', 'Maggie', 'inherit', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'fortune.Questions', 'arise', 'almost', 'start', 'Will', 'Brick', 'Maggie', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'rescue', 'marriage', 'will', 'Brick', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'ever', 'make', 'peace', 'too', 'What', 'fact', 'family', 'family', 'doctor', 'hiding', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'how', 'will', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'take', 'when', 'out', 'Will', 'influence', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'give', 'entire', 'estate', 'one', 'other', 'two', 'sons', 'Watch', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'answers', 'other', 'questions', 'DVD', 'two', 'extras', 'note', 'roughly', 'ten', 'minute', 'retrospective', 'making', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'challenging', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'do', 'film', 'started', 'shooting', 'just', 'husband', 'Mike', 'Todd', 'died', 'plane', 'crash', 'especially', 'liked', 'comments', 'made', 'Madeleine', 'Sherwood', 'extra', 'light', 'retrospective', 'historians', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'was', 'set', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'were', 'not', 'second', 'bonus', 'commentary', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'historian', 'Donald', 'Spoto.Cat', 'A', 'Hot', 'Tin', 'Roof', 'be', 'Amazon.com', 'essential', 'video', 'film', 'superb', 'acting', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'when', 'were', 'still', 'relatively', 'early', 'careers', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'actors', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'classic', 'motion', 'picture', 'will', 'cherish', 'DVD', 'years', 'come']",Cat on a Hot Tin Roof
122016,A152C8GYY25HAH,079079568X,Matthew Horner,"[98, 106]","Tennessee William's play, ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", was considered so controversial that its Broadway producers forced the playwright to alter the third act. Either in spite of or because of the changes, the play was a huge hit. Even with the changes, it had to be further watered down for Hollywood's 1958 movie version. Once more, it was a boxoffice smash. It went on to garner six Oscar nominations, including Best Actress for Elizabeth Taylor and Best Actor for Paul Newman. Despite the industry's timidity back then, the movie was a searing, powerful drama about a family in crisis. That it remains so to this day, despite massive changes in social values and mores over the years, is a credit to its brilliant cast and to its director, Richard Brooks.Brick and Maggie [Newman and Taylor] have come to his father's big plantation in Mississippi to celebrate the old man's 65th birthday. Everyone calls him Big Daddy, and as portrayed by Burl Ives, he truly is a larger than life figure. Brick's brother, Gooper [Jack Carson], his wife, Mae [Madeleine Sherwood], and their five `little no-neck monsters"" are also there. Big Daddy has just returned from several weeks at a clinic where he was treated for cancer. He thinks he is cured, but the doctors have lied to him. He's unlikely to see his next birthday. Rivalry and intrigue abound among the siblings and their families as everyone fights over who will take over the plantation. Brick has major problems of his own. The former star athlete drinks too much, refuses the advances and affection of the gorgeous and calculating Maggie because he blames her for his best friend's suicide, and is bitter about his father, who doesn't seem to love him or anyone else. Brick is also hobbling around on crutches, having recently tripped while trying to leap a hurdle one drunken night. Through all the bickering and fighting, his mother, Big Mama [Judith Anderson], tries desperately to hold onto whatever happiness and dignity the family still possesses. But a storm of confrontations is brewing, and she's powerless to stop it.The `shocking' element that was changed was the revelation that Brick and his friend had been lovers and that Maggie's `crime' was her attempt to eliminate her rival. This was changed to the friend's killing himself because he was weak. I think when you know this, you can easily see what is going on underneath the surface between Brick and Maggie. It also makes the characters more understandable and believable. Their constant fighting makes more sense. The story becomes about more than greed, power, money and land. It becomes about the power of the human heart.""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" is highly recommended, script changes notwithstanding.",5,"Powerful, though altered, version of the play",1023408000,"06 7, 2002",2002,2723,"['Tennessee', 'William', 'play', 'Cat', 'Hot', 'Tin', 'Roof', 'was', 'considered', 'so', 'controversial', 'Broadway', 'producers', 'forced', 'playwright', 'alter', 'third', 'act', 'spite', 'changes', 'play', 'was', 'huge', 'hit', 'Even', 'changes', 'had', 'be', 'further', 'watered', 'down', 'Hollywood', '1958', 'movie', 'version', 'Once', 'more', 'was', 'boxoffice', 'smash', 'went', 'garner', 'six', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'including', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'industry', 'timidity', 'back', 'then', 'movie', 'was', 'searing', 'powerful', 'drama', 'family', 'crisis', 'so', 'day', 'massive', 'changes', 'social', 'values', 'mores', 'years', 'credit', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'director', 'Richard', 'Brooks.Brick', 'Maggie', '[', 'Newman', 'Taylor', ']', 'have', 'come', 'father', 'big', 'plantation', 'Mississippi', 'celebrate', 'old', 'man', '65th', 'birthday', 'Everyone', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'portrayed', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'truly', 'larger', 'life', 'figure', 'Brick', 'brother', 'Gooper', '[', 'Jack', 'Carson', ']', 'wife', 'Mae', '[', 'Madeleine', 'Sherwood', ']', 'five', 'little', 'no-neck', 'monsters', 'are', 'also', 'there', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'just', 'returned', 'several', 'weeks', 'clinic', 'where', 'was', 'treated', 'cancer', 'cured', 'doctors', 'have', 'lied', 'unlikely', 'see', 'next', 'birthday', 'Rivalry', 'intrigue', 'abound', 'siblings', 'families', 'everyone', 'fights', 'who', 'will', 'take', 'over', 'plantation', 'Brick', 'major', 'problems', 'own', 'former', 'star', 'athlete', 'drinks', 'too', 'much', 'advances', 'affection', 'gorgeous', 'calculating', 'Maggie', 'best', 'friend', 'suicide', 'bitter', 'father', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'love', 'anyone', 'else', 'Brick', 'also', 'hobbling', 'around', 'crutches', 'having', 'recently', 'tripped', 'trying', 'leap', 'hurdle', 'one', 'drunken', 'night', 'bickering', 'fighting', 'mother', 'Big', 'Mama', '[', 'Judith', 'Anderson', ']', 'desperately', 'hold', 'happiness', 'dignity', 'family', 'still', 'storm', 'confrontations', 'brewing', 'powerless', 'stop', 'it.The', 'shocking', 'element', 'was', 'changed', 'was', 'revelation', 'Brick', 'friend', 'had', 'been', 'lovers', 'Maggie', 'crime', 'was', 'attempt', 'eliminate', 'rival', 'was', 'changed', 'friend', 'killing', 'was', 'weak', 'think', 'when', 'know', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'surface', 'Brick', 'Maggie', 'also', 'characters', 'more', 'understandable', 'believable', 'constant', 'fighting', 'more', 'sense', 'story', 'more', 'greed', 'power', 'money', 'land', 'power', 'human', 'heart', 'Cat', 'Hot', 'Tin', 'Roof', 'highly', 'recommended', 'script', 'changes', 'notwithstanding']",Cat on a Hot Tin Roof

Taylor gives what I  feel is her best performance on the heels of personal tragedy (as many film  fans know, her husband Mike Todd was killed not long before this movie in a  plane crash) -  this is probably her most subdued performance and to me,  she's always better when she keeps herself under control (as compared to,  say,  &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye,&quot; &quot;Cleopatra,&quot; or  &quot;Boom!&quot;).  Madeleine Sherwood definitely deserved an Oscar  Nomination as &quot;Sister Woman&quot; May, one of the screen's most  hideous harridans, the &quot;monster of fertility&quot; (you just want to  give this woman some birth control tablets).  It's hard for me to  concentrate on symbolism when I watch this movie - I get engulfed in some  of the humor and the general family warfare that prevails, but like all  Williams plays / films, it features a fragile Southern woman who ends up  getting trounced on (&quot;Big Mama&quot; Judith Anderson) and a whole slew  of characters who are hiding things about themselves and are too scared to  face reality (I think every character could be put under this umbrella in  one way or another).

The net result - a good many stage plays often had more than a bit of doctoring going on before making it to the big screen. ""Cat On A Hot Tin Roof"" is no exception.  The original story concerns itself with Brick's homosexuality and his resulting inability to find his lovely wife even remotely attractive - at least enough to impregnate her with an heir to his father's plantation fortune.  However, homosexuality was a big NO, NO in the movies.  So instead we get Brick (Paul Newman) as a sexually frigid prig who thinks that his wife Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) has been having an affair with his best friend, Skipper (whom we never see).  Thus the balance of power and the resulting confusions which are straightened out in the end don't seem to make much sense.  Nevertheless, ""Cat"" is a compelling piece of 50's kitsch.  Richard Brooks ably directs what's left of the plot and the relationship that he fleshes out between Big Daddy (Burl Ives) and Brick is genuinely touching. Dame Judith Anderson gives a poignant and heartbreaking performance as Big Daddy's dopey wife.TRANSFER: YUCK! Colors are weak and not well balanced.  Flesh tones are often jaundice.

122029,ABU7I2Z9M0Q5I,079079568X,"rballjones ""rballjones""","[9, 9]","This is a powerful film full of great acting, built on the play of one of our greatest writers: Tennessee Williams. Even if you're not from the South and it's long past the 50's, the territory he covers is still relevant: old resentments between parent and child, between husband and wife, a woman's role, the feelings that surface when someone close is about to die, insecurity, feelings of worthlessness, greed, failed dreams, new understandings.Yet we're not that far from the 50's when patriarchy was stronger, where there was a distinct double standard and only the men in the family were privy to important decisions--where women were sometimes measured by their ability to produce children, and where so many feelings were repressed and left unsaid.This film works despite its apparent diversion from Williams' original play in avoiding certain sexual taboos.  When watching it I could not understand the problem between Maggie and Brick and Skipper, a plot twist that takes a while to surface and isn't quite resolved, but now that I've read a few reviews here the meaning is plain. It's just another element of depth in an already deep story.Burl Ives as Big Daddy puts on a fabulous performance as does Judith Anderson as Big Momma and Elizabeth Taylor as a beautiful Maggie.  The names, like the characters, are slightly  exaggerated for effect--an effect that works.The film has so many wonderful lines, it's a pleasure just listening to the words--especially when delivered by such fine  actors.  A small sampling:Big Daddy to alcoholic son Brick: ""Truth is dreams that don't come true and nobody prints your name in the paper 'til you die.""Brick to Big Daddy (talking about Big Momma in a basement full of European artifacts): ""You gave her things, Papa, not love.""Maggie (who's scared of losing Big Daddy's inheritance): ""Outside of hunger, the first thing I remember is shame.""Big Daddy: ""We're through with lies and liars in this house.  Lock the door!""And so some understandings some to pass.  The film starts slowly but crescendos into a powerful ending.

122034,AGZVS6M8XJGN6,079079568X,"Roberto Frangie ""Robert""","[15, 15]","In ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,"" Newman is an ex-football player, trying to relive his college athletic glories... Drinking and staggering, he attempts to jump hurdles, resulting in a painful injury that has him hobbling around on crutches during most of the film...The role was certainly another demonstration of his widening range, for Brick is in many ways the antithesis of Ben Quick (""The Long, Hot Summer""). Although he too is cynical, cold and guilt-ridden, he manifests it by becoming moody, withdrawn, introverted... In addition, whereas Ben was strong and decisive, causing and participating in events, Brick is weak and passive, largely reacting to events around him... And he's anything but ambitious: while his greedy brother and sister-in-law await Big Daddy's death so they can inherit his huge fortune and plantation, and while his wife Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) urges him to fight for his share, he merely broods and drinks... An emotionally crippled, ""thirty-year-old boy,"" he refuses to face responsibility and truth, preferring to drown his memories in liquor...Newman and Taylor enact striking contrasts in temperament: she is fiery, loud, animated, sensual; he is cold, quiet, immobile, dispassionate... Brick and Maggie haven't been sleeping together, and she wants him desperately, but he keeps rejecting her advances... As she talks, he replies with sarcasm, contempt and mostly indifference, speaking in a dreamy, monotonous manner, as if only half-there...In conversations with her, as with Big Daddy (Burl Ives), he stares into space, or walks away (usually toward the liquor supply), turning his back on the other party and forcing the dialog to take place on separate planes... All of this places him in a private world, where he hides his torment and anxiety beneath a mask of detachment...If Newman is best at enacting Brick's unspoken thoughts and emotions, he's also effective in the more spirited moments, as when he screams at Maggie or Big Daddy, to prevent them from getting at the truth he wants kept buried... But exactly what the ""truth"" is remains unclear...In the play, Brick's fear of admitting a homosexual attachment led indirectly to his friend's death and explained his overall moodiness and passivity... But because of Hollywood's moral code, director-scriptwriter Richard Brooks had to eliminate this, and the character's motivations are considerably weakened... His hostility toward Maggie--understandable in the play--is especially confusing because it results from events that are unconvincingly outlined...With the homosexuality cut out, Brick's dependence upon his friend is now explained by the failure of Big Daddy to provide strength and love, and this changed emphasis does make for exciting drama... The film's key scene--not in the play--is one in which Brick confronts his father with this painful truth... As they sit in a cellar disarranged with the old man's useless antiques, he tells Big Daddy that love cannot be bought... Newman moves powerfully from anguished looks to an eruption of emotion, smashing everything in sight, finally breaking down and crying: ""All I wanted was a father, not a boss ... I wanted you to love me."" Both are in pain--Big Daddy because of cancer, Brick because his crutch has (symbolically) been broken, and they need each other's he1p to get upstairs... Therefore the film ultimately becomes another statement of father-son alienation, and their coming to terms with it, as in ""The Rack"" and ""Somebody Up There Likes Me,"" leads the characters to a new strength (and an upbeat ending not in the play).Despite its compromises, the film was still daring by 1958 standards, and was an enormous commercial success... It received six Oscar nominations, including one for Newman as Best Actor--his first.

I've seen the play several times and loved it...even it's ambiguous ending (will Brick or won't he?).  However this movie adaptation switches sections of dialogue around in a wonderful way, especially Big Daddy's Act 2 mention of his and Big Mamma's trips and her subsequent buying, that it gives the entire story a really uplifting feel.  I especially loved Jack Carson's Gooper and his acting towards the end (and the direction his character takes, so unlike the play).  Big Daddy's role in Act 3 is given so much more meaning with the movie's basement scene between Ives and Newman.  Every actor is fantastic.  Switching Mae's line about Maggie not having children to one of Mae's children is even more powerful.  I honestly thought I would dislike this film for laundering the plays content but the adaptaion is masterful.  My understanding is that Tenessee Williams did this adaptation and for him to re-envision his own work in such a successful way is truly a marvel.  While I love the true adaptation of the play with Tommy Lee Jones and Jessica Lange, this one stands on its own and it stands high.  I was especially impressed with Paul Newman's Brick.

Like STREETCAR, CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF is filled with tension, much of which arouses from the harrowing confrontations between Brick (Paul Newman) and Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor).  Brick, once a great football player, is now an alcoholic.  He hangs around in his room at his family's home, refusing wife Maggie's consolation and pleas for Brick to love her again.  Brick believes that Maggie slept with Brick's best friend; when she tries to bring up the subject, Brick will hear nothing of it.  When Brick is reunited with his father, Big Daddy (Burl Ives), who is dying of cancer, he finds himself forced to confront the truths of his life while forcing his father to confront the truths of his.As I haven't read the original stageplay, I can't vouch for this adaptation's faithfulness to the source material.  I know that Williams himself despised this adaptation to the point of urging audiences not to see it.  Despite that, Richard Brooks' CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF has gone on to become a classic, thanks largely to outstanding performances from Newman, Taylor, and Ives.  Despite Newman's cruel attitude toward Taylor, we never really think of him a jerk, perhaps because the film makes the point very early on of showing that there's still good within him after Newman's arms automatically rise up to hold Taylor before his rage takes hold of him once more.  Taylor looks more beautiful than anyone in cinematic history.  Ives' gruff performance as ""Big Daddy"" is delightful, particularly toward the end of the film.  All in all, the cast is terrific.Due to a musicians' union strike, there is no original score in the film, only a few bits of library music.  The strike turned out to be a good thing, as the lack of music makes the more tense scenes even more powerful.  The director, Richard Brooks, does a spectacular job, comparable even to Elia Kazan's superb work on his adaptation of A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE.  To top it all off there's excellent color cinematography by William Daniels and taut editing by Ferris Webster.CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF is another stellar Tennesee Williams adaptation and one of the finest and most tense dramas in movie history.
