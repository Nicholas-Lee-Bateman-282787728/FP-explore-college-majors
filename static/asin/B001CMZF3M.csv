1176857,ATSXPURIUF8GC,B001CMZF3M,Richard in Indy,"[0, 0]","The photography is quite simply some of the very best that I've seen.  No stock pictures or still photography are used.  I would rate the visuals at 5 stars.  The soundtrack, however, sounds very tinny and electronic (I would rate one star for the soundtrack).  I find it much more enjoyable to watch the dvd with the sound turned off while playing some of my favorite Christmas cd's. The show is very short but the viewer has the option of ""play one time"" or ""continuous play"".  All in all, I'd recommend this disc as being well worth the purchase price.",4,Beautiful photography -- but oh that soundtrack,1298505600,"02 24, 2011",2011,555,"['photography', 'quite', 'simply', 'very', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'stock', 'pictures', 'still', 'photography', 'are', 'used', 'would', 'rate', 'visuals', '5', 'stars', 'soundtrack', 'however', 'very', 'tinny', 'electronic', 'would', 'rate', 'one', 'star', 'soundtrack', 'find', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'dvd', 'sound', 'turned', 'off', 'playing', 'favorite', 'Christmas', 'cd', 'show', 'very', 'short', 'viewer', 'option', 'play', 'one', 'time', 'continuous', 'play', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'disc', 'being', 'well', 'purchase', 'price']",Almost Home For The Holidays
1176858,A2WARQRIDTIRNJ,B001CMZF3M,Ruby D,"[5, 5]",I purchased this for the last winter season (2009) and really enjoyed it.  It is not long and it is not something you just have to stare at.  I mainly put it on the laptop and just let it go in the background.  I am generally up by 5AM and it was a nice peaceful respite before hearing all of the dreadful news of the day.  Even if you are not a follower of Christmas I think you would enjoy it.  We are having such dreadful heat here in New Jersey that I am about ready to put it on and pretend that it is November.,5,Gorgeous winter scenes - relaxing,1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,516,"['purchased', 'last', 'winter', 'season', '2009', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'long', 'not', 'something', 'just', 'have', 'stare', 'mainly', 'put', 'laptop', 'just', 'let', 'go', 'background', 'am', 'generally', 'up', '5AM', 'was', 'nice', 'peaceful', 'respite', 'hearing', 'dreadful', 'news', 'day', 'Even', 'are', 'not', 'follower', 'Christmas', 'think', 'would', 'enjoy', 'are', 'having', 'such', 'dreadful', 'heat', 'here', 'New', 'Jersey', 'am', 'about', 'ready', 'put', 'pretend', 'November']",Almost Home For The Holidays
