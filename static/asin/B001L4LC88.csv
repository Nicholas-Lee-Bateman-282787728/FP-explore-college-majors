It's sad the show didnt last longer especially considering the shows they have on Nickelodeon now. It was a touching movie about a little girls ""Christmas promise"" that Drake promises to fulfill but theres a twist. When Drake tries to bust Josh out of jail they tell the judge about the promise they made. The judge agrees to not throw them in jail but if they dont fulfill the promise they will head straight back to jail. Things dont go too smoothly at first but in the end it turns out to be a great Christmas after all and a very ""cheesy"" one too...thanks to Crazy Steve and his woodchipper Sally. I enjoyed this movie better than the previous two Drake and Josh movies.

I do agree that the show was a bit out of reality but all christmas shows at least the good ones are always a bit out there I mean like Scrooge or Miracle on 34th street I mean c'mon it is a christmas show after all the time of miracles and make believe and fun. Yes there is the religous side but if you perfer then watch the ten commandments.  I Love this show as much as all the others and I thank god for them especially since I lost my mom this year and this show and Drake Bell is the only things that can make me laugh or smile.  Oh by the way the show is called Drake and Josh Miranda is not the main star so it should say starring Drake Bell and Josh Peck shame on amazon.,5,supercalifragilisticexpedolidocious,1229644800,"12 19, 2008",2008,821,"['loved', 'movie', 'show', 'Drake', 'Josh', 'period', 'are', 'funniest', 'team', 'around', 'are', 'so', 'eachother', 'time', 'do', 'agree', 'show', 'was', 'bit', 'reality', 'christmas', 'shows', 'least', 'good', 'ones', 'are', 'always', 'bit', 'there', 'mean', 'Scrooge', 'Miracle', '34th', 'street', 'mean', ""c'mon"", 'christmas', 'show', 'time', 'miracles', 'make', 'believe', 'fun', 'Yes', 'religous', 'side', 'perfer', 'then', 'watch', 'ten', 'commandments', 'Love', 'show', 'as', 'much', 'others', 'thank', 'god', 'especially', 'lost', 'mom', 'year', 'show', 'Drake', 'Bell', 'only', 'things', 'can', 'make', 'smile', 'Oh', 'way', 'show', 'called', 'Drake', 'Josh', 'Miranda', 'not', 'main', 'star', 'should', 'say', 'starring', 'Drake', 'Bell', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'shame', 'amazon']","Merry Christmas, Drake & Josh"

Feels like a REAL ripoff knowing this movie was originally shot and aired in HD and that the DVD transfer is SO soft and poor.  The DVD ""menu"" screen looked out of focus as did the intro shots and scenes.  The vaguely blurry out of focus aspects went away but the incredibly CRAPPY DVD transfer was on display for the entire rest of the movie.  ANY show that was shot and aired in HD could receive a GREAT DVD transfer that looks solid upconverted (think CSI, Supernatural, Fringe what have you) the grainy and poor quality transfer on this disc is unconscionable!The movie itself is fairly original and has moments of almost tear jerking laughter!  Having an eight year old boy get beat up and urinated on by a monkey on Christmas morning may not sound like Christmas fare and that is exactly WHY it is original and funny.Movie content is classic Drake N Josh but the quality of the DVD transfer almost ruined it for us!",3,Great movie with a POOR DVD transfer!,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,1003,"['movie', 'was', 'SO', 'much', 'better', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'HD', 'Nickelodeon', 'Feels', 'REAL', 'ripoff', 'knowing', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'shot', 'aired', 'HD', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'SO', 'soft', 'poor', 'DVD', 'menu', 'screen', 'looked', 'focus', 'did', 'intro', 'shots', 'scenes', 'vaguely', 'blurry', 'focus', 'aspects', 'went', 'away', 'incredibly', 'CRAPPY', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'was', 'display', 'entire', 'rest', 'movie', 'ANY', 'show', 'was', 'shot', 'aired', 'HD', 'could', 'receive', 'GREAT', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'solid', 'upconverted', 'think', 'CSI', 'Supernatural', 'Fringe', 'what', 'have', 'grainy', 'poor', 'quality', 'transfer', 'disc', 'unconscionable', 'movie', 'fairly', 'original', 'moments', 'almost', 'tear', 'jerking', 'laughter', 'Having', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'get', 'beat', 'up', 'urinated', 'monkey', 'Christmas', 'morning', 'may', 'not', 'sound', 'Christmas', 'fare', 'exactly', 'WHY', 'original', 'funny.Movie', 'content', 'classic', 'Drake', 'N', 'Josh', 'quality', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'almost', 'ruined']","Merry Christmas, Drake & Josh"

Josh throws a party on top of the movie theater when a couple of guys crash the party. Josh calls the police, Josh is then arrested for no apparent reason. Drake attempts to break Josh out of jail, They both get put on house arrest. The judge then orders to the boys to make that little girl's christmas promise come true, along with her family, and that promise is to give her the best christmas she has ever had.First of all, why on earth was Josh arrested?! Why would a big scary guy who Josh met in prison pose as santa? Why would any judge, in the court of law, force someone to give a little girl and her family a christmas promise? Why weren't their parents notified? Aren't they still minors? Why wasn't the little girl and her family aware of the situation Drake and Josh were in? Why did the little girl get upset when her brother and her found out the situation Drake and Josh were in? Were they not doing their job? How did bludge get out of prison and show up as santa?Sorry, but I just found this film completely absurd. They tried to make a new Good Burger, but it didn't work. The acting was overdone too. I just feel like as Drake and Josh fans, they kinda let us down.
