Season three adds many popular people and maintains the tradition of good writing and acting.Aside from the great acting one thing that makes this program work is that they pick on problems that one could actually face and show how absurd one can get before coming back to earth. There is everything from job loss to weight gain.On this set of DVDs there are some commentaries; the commentaries are not as well thought put as they could have been, however they do add a dimension to the episodes. I hope they still keep going with the series.We did learn that somewhere out there is a pilot of Peter Bonerz whom plays Dr. Jerry Robinson plays a more advances psychologist instead of a dentist.

969596,AWLFVCT9128JV,B000E6ES9Y,"Dave_42 ""Dave_42""","[15, 15]","The third season (1974-1975) of ""The Bob Newhart Show"" for me is not quite as good as the second season.  To be sure, there are many very funny episodes, but there is one area where it seems to come up short and that is the lack of appearances by the main group of patients.  In fact, Mrs. Bakerman (Florida Friebus) doesn't appear at all during the season, and for the only appearance of Mr. Gianelli he is played by Daniel J. Travanti (later of Hill Street Blues) instead of by Noam Pitlik who played him in the previous seasons.  In addition, John Fiedler makes only one appearance as Mr. Peterson during the season.That is not to say that there are no Group appearances, because they do experiment with some new groups such as an all woman's group, and an elderly group (including Mr. Carlin), and they even have Bob as a patient in a group (again including Mr. Carlin).  They also develop some new or previously rarely seen patients such as Mr. Herd (Oliver Clark), Mr. Plager (Howard Hesseman), Mrs. Loomis (Merie Earle), and the very funny Mr. Vickers (Lucian Scott).  Ellen Hartley (Pat Finley) also becomes a fairly regular member of the cast.In season two there were many guest stars which went on to make names for themselves, and there are a few this year as well but not as many and for the most part they are not as well known as those in season two.  John Ritter is great as Dave, a server at an ice cream shop.  Edward Winter plays an ambitious executive at an insurance company.  Fred Willard plays Ellen's ex-fianc&eacute; John Tobin.  Also, Bob's real-life father-in-law Bill Quinn makes a couple of appearances as Eddie the Mailman.There are many very funny episodes this season as well.  In ""The Battle of the Groups"" Bob is talked into taking two of his groups on a marathon session.  ""The Great Timpau Medical Co-op Experiment"" is another wonderful episode in which Bob's fellow doctors form a co-op where they treat each other for free.  The doctors also play a big role in ""Serve for Daylight"" where they compete in a mixed-doubles tennis tournament.  Bob gives up his private practice to become a staff psychologist at Loggers Casualty Insurance Company in ""The Gray Flannel Shrink"".  Emily helps to organize a children's summer camp in ""Emily Hits the Ceiling"".  There are many more as well.All 24 episodes are included on three 2-sided DVDs as was the case with the first two seasons.  Like the second season, there are five episodes with commentary, and there is a featurette for the season on the third disk.  Once again the commentaries are not very engaging, and this is probably true because Bob's talking style is very drawn out and he is known for great reactions which cannot be captured on an audio commentary effectively.  Bob is on all the commentaries and there are two with Peter Bonerz who plays Dr. Jerry Robinson; one with Fred Willard; one with director Jim Burrows; and Bob does one by himself.  The one with Jim Burrows is my favorite, as he talks about his early directing experiences and where he messed up when filming the episode.",4,In Need Of Group Therapy,1153440000,"07 21, 2006",2006,3081,"['third', 'season', '1974-1975', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Show', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'second', 'season', 'be', 'sure', 'are', 'many', 'very', 'funny', 'episodes', 'one', 'area', 'where', 'come', 'up', 'short', 'lack', 'appearances', 'main', 'group', 'patients', 'fact', 'Mrs.', 'Bakerman', 'Florida', 'Friebus', ""n't"", 'appear', 'season', 'only', 'appearance', 'Mr.', 'Gianelli', 'played', 'Daniel', 'J.', 'Travanti', 'later', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'instead', 'Noam', 'Pitlik', 'who', 'played', 'previous', 'seasons', 'addition', 'John', 'Fiedler', 'only', 'one', 'appearance', 'Mr.', 'Peterson', 'season.That', 'not', 'say', 'are', 'Group', 'appearances', 'do', 'experiment', 'new', 'groups', 'such', 'woman', 'group', 'elderly', 'group', 'including', 'Mr.', 'Carlin', 'even', 'have', 'Bob', 'patient', 'group', 'again', 'including', 'Mr.', 'Carlin', 'also', 'develop', 'new', 'previously', 'rarely', 'seen', 'patients', 'such', 'Mr.', 'Herd', 'Oliver', 'Clark', 'Mr.', 'Plager', 'Howard', 'Hesseman', 'Mrs.', 'Loomis', 'Merie', 'Earle', 'very', 'funny', 'Mr.', 'Vickers', 'Lucian', 'Scott', 'Ellen', 'Hartley', 'Pat', 'Finley', 'also', 'fairly', 'regular', 'member', 'cast.In', 'season', 'two', 'were', 'many', 'guest', 'stars', 'went', 'make', 'names', 'are', 'few', 'year', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'many', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'season', 'two', 'John', 'Ritter', 'great', 'Dave', 'server', 'ice', 'cream', 'shop', 'Edward', 'Winter', 'ambitious', 'executive', 'insurance', 'company', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'Ellen', 'ex-fianc', 'eacute', 'John', 'Tobin', 'Also', 'Bob', 'real-life', 'father-in-law', 'Bill', 'Quinn', 'couple', 'appearances', 'Eddie', 'Mailman.There', 'are', 'many', 'very', 'funny', 'episodes', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'Battle', 'Groups', 'Bob', 'talked', 'taking', 'two', 'groups', 'marathon', 'session', 'Great', 'Timpau', 'Medical', 'Co-op', 'Experiment', 'wonderful', 'episode', 'Bob', 'fellow', 'doctors', 'form', 'co-op', 'where', 'treat', 'other', 'free', 'doctors', 'also', 'play', 'big', 'role', 'Serve', 'Daylight', 'where', 'compete', 'mixed-doubles', 'tennis', 'tournament', 'Bob', 'up', 'private', 'practice', 'become', 'staff', 'psychologist', 'Loggers', 'Casualty', 'Insurance', 'Company', 'Gray', 'Flannel', 'Shrink', 'Emily', 'organize', 'children', 'summer', 'camp', 'Emily', 'Ceiling', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'well.All', '24', 'episodes', 'are', 'included', 'three', '2-sided', 'DVDs', 'was', 'case', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'second', 'season', 'are', 'five', 'episodes', 'commentary', 'featurette', 'season', 'third', 'disk', 'Once', 'again', 'commentaries', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'engaging', 'probably', 'true', 'Bob', 'talking', 'style', 'very', 'drawn', 'out', 'known', 'great', 'reactions', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'captured', 'audio', 'commentary', 'effectively', 'Bob', 'commentaries', 'are', 'two', 'Peter', 'Bonerz', 'who', 'Dr.', 'Jerry', 'Robinson', 'one', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'one', 'director', 'Jim', 'Burrows', 'Bob', 'one', 'one', 'Jim', 'Burrows', 'favorite', 'early', 'directing', 'experiences', 'where', 'messed', 'up', 'when', 'filming', 'episode']",The Bob Newhart Show - The Complete Third Season

Being born and bred in Chicago, though, there was a great mystery here...In the opening sequence, we see Bob leaving his downtown Chicago office.  We then see him repeatedly going back and forth across the north branch of the Chicago River.  Which leads any reviewer to speculate on the causes for this:1.  Did he find Emily (Suzanne Pleshette) too hard to take, and was debating whether to go home or not?2.  Did Bob have undiagnosed ADHD?3.

969613,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B000E6ES9Y,Phil S.,"[2, 2]","Seems that most long-running and successful sitcoms got it down by the third season. Yes, the *characters* have solidified, but strangely in this season, the writing seems, in too many cases, to be for *any* TV sitcom character.Each episode has one or two classic lines, and there are some entertaining sight gags here and there. And, of course, Newhart's incredible one-two punch of delivery and reaction is a great feature, actually what drives the show.Particularly curious are the roles of Hartley's sister and next-door-neighbor. ""Ellen"" is attractive and spirited but has little to do or say, and her fiance, ""Howard"", is impossibly eccentric. Sitcoms all seem to have a wacky neighbor down the hall, but this guy bounds into the Hartley living room to slow down the show and deliver silly soliloques. And to make it worse, he's given tight one-shots, instead of long shots which include Bob reading the newspaper, which changes the focus of the scene to Bob's reaction, not Howard's babbling.Doctor Hartley's best foils were the staff at the office: the Dentist Jerry and the Receptionist Carol, always engaging. Indeed, one of the best moments in Season Three, and for my money, in TV history, is the scene in ""Life Is A Hamburger"", where Jerry and Carol passionately kiss when all other guests have left the engagement party. Carol's fiance, a wanna-be poet with nothing to say *or* write has departed, and the romantic move is mutual and real. Was it real, suppressed feeling coming to the surface because of the emotionality of the get-together, or a kind of relief that the door has been re-opened for some possible future occasion for them? The scene is quiet but the body language is impactful. Two fine actors.The worst episode is ""Emily Hits The Ceiling"", where Emily is a summer camp planner and tries to enlist Bob as a Counselor. A bad premise, replete with foolish dialogue, including too much from Howard, in Native-American dress, providing all the stereotypical stuff you can imagine.Runner-up is ""Vote Smartly - Think Hartley"": more uninspired writing and direction, in a bit about Bob being persuaded to run for Chairman of the local School Board because the incumbent has been a no-show.Not to end this review on the downbeat, a very good show is ""Serve For Daylight"", about a charity Tennis Tournament with Bob trying to suppress his mad desire to win the trophy, then quickly losing it because wife nad tennis-partner Emily had tennis lessons which were...non-productive.Interesting featurette with Bob Newhart around 2005, summing up the series.

Her role just alters the chemistry between Bob & Emily, in fact the show seems altered when she is on the set and her persona bothers me. A bigger problem I have with this Season is the fact that too many of the stories either do not involve Bob or Emily or many do not further their characters. The past Seasons had Bob trying to come to grips with buying a house and the two thinking about kids, this season had none of that and too many scripts revolve around not so funny moments with irrelavent story lines. In short, the writing was less personalized and seemed more ""70's assembly line"" (Bob runs for office? Gah. Talk about out-of-idea-cliches!). The humor here in Season Three of Bob Newhart is also canned jokes that really only made me laugh a time or two. This is not to say I do not endorse buying the show, it is still a nice value, however in the world of Bob Newhart, IMO, this is the weak link so far.The extras are welcomed and while sparse still OUTDUE all others for older shows like ALL in the Family which have none. And like All in the Family Season Four, I distinguish between good seasons and bad and do not just give them all five stars. There are bright moments though, when Bill Daily is trying to impress his son and make him like Ellen was quite good, but then again, it seemed more like a spin off since Bob and Emily were once again in the background.",3,Season Two was better,1143763200,"03 31, 2006",2006,1677,"['realize', 'am', 'going', 'conventional', 'wisdom', 'old', 'shows', 'get', '5', 'stars', 'nostaglia', 'factor', 'regardless', 'however', 'have', 'problems', 'Season', 'Three', 'call', 'sees', 'them.I', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'Bobs', 'sister', 'Ellen', 'houses', 'fairly', 'significant', 'role', 'Season', 'role', 'just', 'chemistry', 'Bob', 'Emily', 'fact', 'show', 'altered', 'when', 'set', 'persona', 'bothers', 'bigger', 'problem', 'have', 'Season', 'fact', 'too', 'many', 'stories', 'do', 'not', 'involve', 'Bob', 'Emily', 'many', 'do', 'not', 'further', 'characters', 'past', 'Seasons', 'had', 'Bob', 'trying', 'come', 'grips', 'buying', 'house', 'two', 'thinking', 'kids', 'season', 'had', 'none', 'too', 'many', 'scripts', 'revolve', 'not', 'so', 'funny', 'moments', 'irrelavent', 'story', 'lines', 'short', 'writing', 'was', 'less', 'personalized', 'seemed', 'more', '70', 'assembly', 'line', 'Bob', 'office', 'Gah', 'Talk', 'out-of-idea-cliches', 'humor', 'here', 'Season', 'Three', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'also', 'canned', 'jokes', 'really', 'only', 'made', 'time', 'two', 'not', 'say', 'do', 'not', 'endorse', 'buying', 'show', 'still', 'nice', 'value', 'however', 'world', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'IMO', 'weak', 'link', 'far.The', 'extras', 'are', 'welcomed', 'sparse', 'still', 'OUTDUE', 'others', 'older', 'shows', 'ALL', 'Family', 'have', 'none', 'All', 'Family', 'Season', 'Four', 'distinguish', 'good', 'seasons', 'bad', 'do', 'not', 'just', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'are', 'bright', 'moments', 'when', 'Bill', 'Daily', 'trying', 'impress', 'son', 'make', 'Ellen', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'then', 'again', 'seemed', 'more', 'spin', 'off', 'Bob', 'Emily', 'were', 'once', 'again', 'background']",The Bob Newhart Show - The Complete Third Season
