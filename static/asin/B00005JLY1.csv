609345,AJWMVSLEVJ1UP,B00005JLY1,Alan W. Petrucelli,"[240, 264]","It would be easy, perhaps too easy but all together appropriate, to sing Rick McKay's praises. We could say that ""he dreamed a dream of days gone by."" Or that he ""had a dream/a dream about you baby/It's gonna come true baby."" Or ""to dream the impossible dream "" It's only fitting that McKay's impossible dream came true, a dream that began while he was growing up in the '60s in Beech Grove, Indiana. As a child, he read and wondered about the neon lights of Broadway. He wanted to know about the so-called Golden Age of Broadway, when Carol and Gwen and Chita and Robert and Ethel and John and Angela and Alfred and other luminaries lit up the marquees; about the days and nights when a seat in the balcony cost less than a first-run movie ticket; about the plays and musicals that had people lining up before the Great White Way became such a fabulously famous, and too often colorless, invalid. Some people can be content, playing bingo and paying rent. Not Rick McKay. In 1981, he moved to New York, wishing for a theatrical future and hoping to document the past. Armed with a camera, a potent Rolodex and unbridled perseverance, he set out to find as many Broadway legends as he could to question them about one thing: Was there really a Golden Age of Broadway? And if so, what happened to it? He wrote letters. A few responded. One --- Gwen Verdon --- dropped by his apartment, where McKay interviewed her with his hand-held camera. (It became the final interview Verdon did before her death.) For five years, McKay persevered, interviewing whomever he could wherever he could, going to England to chase down Jeremy Irons, traveling nearly six hours by bus to meet Maureen Stapleton at her New England home --- and to be greeted at the door with ""Who the f--- is that?"" Whenever the money ran out, McKay hosted fundraising parties and sold his personal possession; his piano went for $1,700. He eventually ended up with 250 hours of footage that he edited (on the Murphy bed of his teeny apartment) down to the 111-minute documentary, ""Broadway: The Golden Age."" A valentine that's as historical as it is entertaining, Broadway pays homage to the parade that passed by ... and to those folk who are today passed by and to those who have passed on to the Great Green Room in the Sky. The flick is crammed with towering theatrical talents from the '40s through the '60s ... a veritable Playbill of four-star names, from A (Abbott, George) to Z (Ziemba, Karen), with a middle stage crammed with 98 more, including Julie Harris and Carol Burnett and John Raitt and Elaine Stritch and Shirley MacLaine and Angela Lansbury and Chita Rivera and John Raitt and Kander and Ebb and Comden and Green and Harold Prince and Stephen Sondheim and ... well, you get the idea. But ""Broadway: The Golden Age"" is so much more than a talking-head talkfest of 100 sterling legends reminiscing about those 24-karat decades. The film's divided into several ""chapters"" (such as ""The First Time,"" ""Getting the Job,""  ""The Days of Out-of-Town Previews""), and McKay intercuts memories with music, rare archival footage, home movies, newsreels, videotapes and film clips and theatrical trailers. Some of the footage is exceedingly rare: I gasped when viewing Laurette Taylor in her 1938 screen test for David O. Selznick, the only existing sound film she ever made. I cried while watching Bob Fosse assisting his then-wife Gwen Verdon in a ""Whatever Lola Wants"" run through from ""Damn Yankees."" Ben Gazzara as Brick in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" mesmerized me in footage everyone (including the actor) was certain did not exist. The stories told are passionate and priceless. Some will break your heart. Some will make you weep. Others amuse, few annoy. The actors talk about first jobs, missed roles, big breaks, empty stomachs and emptier pockets, disappointment and despair, being hired and fired, hope and honor, famous co-stars (and sometimes bedmates), out-of-town try-outs and the days when performers didnt need microphones. They talk from their hearts and souls as only show folk do. Ben Gazzara talks about his alcohol-sodden affair with Elaine Stritch and muses (in a most loving way): ""You'd look at her and think, 'How much can one person drink?'"" Later, when most of the then-struggling artists remember the days of hanging out at Walgreens, Stritch barks: ""I never went through that drugstore period,. I went to saloons."" (Make sure you stay until the very end of the film: Stritch gets the last comment ... and what a doozy it is!) Marian Seldes cites Laurette Taylor, Kim Stanley and Geraldine Page as the theater's three finest actresses. Shirley MacLaine reveals that she became the first Broadway star to utter a certain scatological four-letter word on stage (when she dropped her hat during the now-legendary ""Steam Heat"" number of ""The Pajama Game) ... and how she survived on lemonade ... with the lemons, water and sugar, free for the taking at the Automat. Julie Harris openly weeps when she recalls seeing Ethel Waters on stage for the first time. Carol Burnett recalls how she and her three roommates had so little money that they shared a ""rehearsal"" dress whoever got the job paid for its dry cleaning. Some of the stories didn't make the cut (McKay is working on a sequel, ""Broadway: The Next Generation."")Here's one for starters: McKay remembers chatting with Charles Nelson Reilly. ""He told me that the night before our interview, he had watched Julie Harris in ""The Member of the Wedding,"" Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy in ""The Fourposter,"" Laurence Olivier in ""The Entertainer"" and Laurette Taylor in ""The Glass Menagerie,"" McKay recalls. ""Charlie said, `Those films are clearer than my tape of `All About Eve,' because they're up here --- and then he touched his head. That's what you must tell people `that they will never forget what happens to them in the theater.'""",5,CURTAIN RISES ONCE AGAIN ON THE GOLDEN AGE OF BROADWAY,1098057600,"10 18,

My parents took me to this film and I was totally against seeing it as I thought it was too corny for words but now I just SO INSPIRED. Part of me was way depressed after as I thought I had missed the greatest time in history, but now I am inspired to learn all I can. Elaine Stitch?! Ohmygod! How cool is SHE? I have now seen ""At Liberty"" (same director, Rick McKay?) like three times, too.I have never sat on the edge of my seat for two hours like this. At the end I was crying my eyes out and then the AMAZING credits started with people singing and I found myself laughing with tears running down at the same time. These STARS are unbelievable.This movie also makes me mad. Mad that it costs like $70 for cheap seats and $100 for top seats for ""Wicked"" or ""Hairspray"" and this movies talks about how 50 years ago cheap seats in the broadway theater were cheaper than going to the movies. How did THAT happen? I mean it is sinful.What was totally cool is that everybody -- and I mean strangers -- were talking to each other in the lobby of the theater after. It was like we had all seen something magical. I had no idea until I read this other review (sour grapes, me thinks) that the director was singing the title song. I don't know how we would know, But, I am now even MORE impressed! I mean the singing was great. But, I didn't pay that much attention to it. But, I DID pay enough attention to the fact that he was a one-man-movie studio and made the whole movie himself. And he sang the title song too?! Whoa!

Funny, sad, moving and uplifting.  Also Thrilling and invigorating.  Rick McKay's passion matches matches that of his subjects and it shows.  Not just in the way he treats his subjects, but in the way he and his crew tracked down rare and in some cases unseen footage(I'm thinking particularly of Laurette Taylor's screen test, and my jaw just dropped!)  People we've known in a certain way, we suddenly discover the breadth of their talent and it's just mind blowing.

It is indeed a treasure.  Many reviewers here have outlined the array of talent assembled, the footage of Times Square in all its glory during the periods discussed in the documentary, the clips of live performances, etc.  It is our duty to preserve our history and our rich cultural heritage; when I see people like Jerry Orbach and Gwen Verdon here, greats who have passed on, it's so moving.  The heart in this film is immense; it was fittingly a labor of love reflecting the great love of theater by all involved. It also includes comments by Diana Rigg and Jeremy Irons, by the way.  One of my own favorite parts was when so many luminaries named Laurette Taylor as the performer who blew them away and influenced them in their formative years in theater -- a performance that has never been preserved on film.  Some people saw her seven times in ""The Glass Menagerie.""  To me, that was the core of the film, its essence.  Without records, without preservation, amazing treasures are lost forever.  Maybe we can't see the show itself again, but the words of these people, the clips help recreate the feeling in our minds of what was.  It's something to covet and treasure and hold onto.  It's the story of Broadway, of a time when one could paint the town red with $2, when one could see a show for 25 cents(!) and ""gypsies"" had so many shows to travel between.

609361,A9TG2NFA614S9,B00005JLY1,John F. Rooney,"[3, 3]","""Broadway: The Golden Age"" (2004) gathers together a group of older Broadway luminaries (many of them now dead or ailing), and they bemoan the death of Broadway. The Golden Age was wonderful, but they say it's all over. The movie charts the Golden Age from about World War II up until about 1968. Except if in 2010 you look at the list of shows playing, Broadway is far from dead and is making more money than ever. It is true that we have practically no straight plays running, and that American drama on Broadway is, at the moment, moribund, but that's for a lack of outstanding playwrights.When these old-timers talk about the golden years, they are really talking about their acting community and the creative people they grew up with. They are talking about how the economics of Broadway has changed, and how special effects, miking, and technical innovations have revolutionized Broadway.To many of them Laurette Taylor (""The Glass Menagerie""), Kim Stanley, and Marlon Brando were the greatest actors they'd ever seen mainly because they were so natural and so unactorish. There's a lot of humor in this reminiscing, and it brings back many wonderful memories for me because I lived through this era. They emphasized the importance of touring in the old days. The big stars hit the road every summer and after successful runs on Broadway.There's a lot about the hang-outs these stars frequented when they were climbing to the top: Sardi's, Gray's drugstore, Howard Johnson's, Downey's restaurant, the Automat.Angela Lansdury describes how she connived with Jerry Herman to star in ""Mame"". To many of them the death knell of the American musical was ""Hair"". This is a documentary as much about generational differences as it is about Broadway as an institution.You will recognize the scores of stars who are giving their opinions, and seeing them again is a delight: Charles Nelson Reilly, Carol Channing, Al Hirschfeld, Jerry Herman, Stephen Sondheim, Maureen Stapleton, Ben Gazzara, Hal Prince, Jerry Orbach, Carol Burnett, Gwen Verdon, and, oh, so many more.Theater is live. What happens that one day is never seen again. In almost all cases we have no film record of the great Broadway performances. They are all lost forever. They are simply memories, and now we are losing the people who were there.This a great movie of nostalgia for anyone who lived in that era or who wants to learn about it.

609362,A28KSCL0MO6MJ3,B00005JLY1,L. Taylor,"[29, 33]","My wife and I saw ""Broadway: The Golden Age"" for the second time last night. It was at Robert DeNiro's Tribeca Theatre Festival and we applaud him for celebrating this film and Rick McKay! Wy wife is a musical theatre performer and I am an actor. We moved to NYC a year ago and have beeen out there auditioning. Our families think we are crazy and we now know what to get everyone in our family for Christmas to help them understand how great theatre can be - and how great a movie can be!The movie theater was sold out and people were going crazy for the film. We didn't realize that the director Rick McKay was introducing the film, which was a great bonus. He also showed about 20 minutes of the footage from the sequel, ""Broadway: The Next Generation,"" which was right up our alley. I actually cried hearing Cady Huffman talk about Bob Fosse in that preivew. I gather that we are the first audience to ever see this footage and that there is even more on the DVD. Wow!Another great surprise was that Ben Gazzara was there and he and Rick McKay did a talk back with the audience after. Rick McKay rules as an interviewer. Ben Gazzara totally opened up with him and McKay got great stories out of him. Then they signed books and stuff in the bar after. Amazing night.But, this film is even better the second time. I can't wait to own it. It is just full of details and treats and fascinating rare footage. Ben Gazzara almost cried talking after about the footage in the film McKay found of Laurette Taylor. And seeing Gwen Verdon's last interview with this lost footage restored of her and Bob Fosse working together is so moving. The audience cheered at the high note John Raitt sang (Bonnie Raitt's dad!) and the rare footage of NYC and the stories of the passion of all these stars to just work on the stage. I enjoyed the PBS TV show last week, but they are so different. I think that tv show would be a good thing for my little brother back home to see in school. it is very useful. But, no one could understand the passion that makes great art seeing that one. This movie is just stunning. My wife and I talked aobut it all last night. And again today as we came on line to buy DVD's of it for Christmas. It is a true gift in more ways than one.

609367,A1OKXNPSAOACK2,B00005JLY1,"Scott E. Miller ""New Line Theatre""","[20, 55]","Well, I just got the documentary ""Broadway The Golden Age"" on DVD, and though there are some nice interviews, it's disappointing. Don't waste your money.First of all, the central premise of the film is that the 1950s and 60s were the pinnacle of the history of American theatre and that where we are now sucks. So many of the people interviewed are long past their prime, and they spew out a long litany of gloom and doom about how awful the American theatre is now -- and they make the huge mistake of equating the American theatre with Broadway. When they were working, Broadway was it, but today there are thousands of professional theatres all over America, doing exciting work! And they act as if that doesn't even exist.I think too many people forget how many utterly forgettable, mediocre musicals and plays opened (and quickly closed) on Broadway alongside the classics we all know now. And it's sad to me that these people who worked back then don't realize how thrilling the American theatre is right now (even though Broadway is no longer the center of that universe). And they forget that a big part of the reason it was all so magic to them is that they were KIDS fulfilling their dreams -- of course that was more magic to them than going to see a show today...This documentary maker believes that HAIR was the beginning of Broadway's downfall. What a crock. To discount the Hal Prince-Stephen Sondheim masterpieces of the 70s, the Kander & Ebb masterpieces, the brilliant work of the 90s, the amazing surprises of the new millennium from the New Generation, seems to me to be nothing more than ignorance.There are other disappointments too. The film maker really wants it to be about him -- he starts the film with a short bio of himself. What's that about? And there are a lot of minor factual errors in the film, like the assertion that ""Les Miz"" takes place during the French Revolution (it doesn't).It makes me crazy that it's considered such a tragedy that kids today wouldn't be interested in an Irving Berlin musical. Of course they won't! We don't drive Edsels and we don't use Underwood typewriters anymore either -- why should today's kids have to love music from 60 years ago??? In 1950, kids would not have wanted to see ""HMS Pinafore"" -- why is that so tragic???Like I said, I would not recommend this -- there was very little new info in it, and it just left me angry that all these people have so little respect for the theatre being created today...",2,"A sad, short-sighted film that thinks theatre sucks today...",1100649600,"11 17, 2004",2004,2480,"['Well', 'just', 'got', 'documentary', 'Broadway', 'Golden', 'Age', 'DVD', 'are', 'nice', 'interviews', 'disappointing', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money.First', 'central', 'premise', 'film', '1950s', '60s', 'were', 'pinnacle', 'history', 'American', 'theatre', 'where', 'are', 'now', 'sucks', 'So', 'many', 'people', 'interviewed', 'are', 'long', 'prime', 'spew', 'out', 'long', 'litany', 'gloom', 'doom', 'how', 'awful', 'American', 'theatre', 'now', 'make', 'huge', 'mistake', 'equating', 'American', 'theatre', 'Broadway', 'When', 'were', 'working', 'Broadway', 'was', 'today', 'are', 'thousands', 'professional', 'theatres', 'America', 'doing', 'exciting', 'work', 'act', ""n't"", 'even', 'exist.I', 'think', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'forget', 'how', 'many', 'utterly', 'forgettable', 'mediocre', 'musicals', 'plays', 'opened', 'quickly', 'closed', 'Broadway', 'classics', 'know', 'now', 'sad', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'back', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'thrilling', 'American', 'theatre', 'right', 'now', 'even', 'Broadway', 'no', 'longer', 'center', 'universe', 'forget', 'big', 'part', 'reason', 'was', 'so', 'magic', 'were', 'KIDS', 'fulfilling', 'dreams', 'course', 'was', 'more', 'magic', 'going', 'see', 'show', 'today', 'documentary', 'maker', 'HAIR', 'was', 'beginning', 'Broadway', 'downfall', 'What', 'crock', 'discount', 'Hal', 'Prince-Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'masterpieces', '70s', 'Kander', 'Ebb', 'masterpieces', 'brilliant', 'work', '90s', 'amazing', 'surprises', 'new', 'millennium', 'New', 'Generation', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'ignorance.There', 'are', 'other', 'disappointments', 'too', 'film', 'maker', 'really', 'be', 'film', 'short', 'bio', 'What', 'are', 'lot', 'minor', 'factual', 'errors', 'film', 'assertion', 'Les', 'Miz', 'place', 'French', 'Revolution', ""n't"", '.It', 'crazy', 'considered', 'tragedy', 'kids', 'today', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'interested', 'Irving', 'Berlin', 'musical', 'course', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'drive', 'Edsels', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'Underwood', 'typewriters', 'anymore', 'why', 'should', 'today', 'kids', 'have', 'love', 'music', '60', 'years', 'ago', '1950', 'kids', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'wanted', 'see', 'HMS', 'Pinafore', 'why', 'so', 'tragic', 'said', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'new', 'info', 'just', 'left', 'angry', 'people', 'have', 'so', 'little', 'respect', 'theatre', 'being', 'created', 'today']","Broadway: The Golden Age, by the Legends Who Were There [VHS]"
