1002621,A2LWUNJVOGYUIM,B000GETUAQ,Chad Radford,"[0, 3]","This has to be one of the cheesiest 1980's movies ever made.  Everyone is so clean cut and when they act ""wild"" they aren't really doing anything that exciting.  Released in 1985, right in the middle of the conservative Reagan years, this movie is a low budget affair that is nothing special at all. Its just a movie.  The best thing about it is Betsy Russell who is always hot and she looks great in her short cutoff shorts.  Her friend in the movie has a very hot body too but she is not too attractive in the face at all.  Still, Betsy has a better body than her but she is the star of the movie so that is to be expected.  The movie is about a young girl who is an auto mechanic and tomboy who wants to prove that she can do everything just as well as a guy can.  She's tough and, at first, doesn't seem to have a romantic side to her at all.  She meets a race car driver who she eventually falls head over heels over and when he makes a comment that she cannot drive a racecar as well as he can then she sets out to prove him wrong.  The movie is very predictable.  You probably can already guess the ending by reading this keeping in mind the typical plot format of American movies from the Eighties.  For a comedy, its not really funny at all.  Its just best for watching Betsy Russell look good.

1002623,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B000GETUAQ,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[79, 93]","While the average movie watcher may not recognize the name Betsy Russell (Private School, Cheerleader Camp), those of us males who grew up in the 1980s, weaned on hours of dedicated cable viewing, know her as something akin to a goddess in the world of dumb, teen comedies for basically two reasons...she was one fine babe, and she didn't seem to mind showing some skinage, as evident in the film Tomboy (1985), among others.  Originally released by Crown International Pictures, the film was directed by Herb Freed (Graduation Day, Survival Game) and stars, as I mentioned, Ms. Russell.  Also appearing is Gerard Christopher (""Superboy""), Kristi Somers (Hardbodies), Richard Erdman (The Blue Gardenia), and the late Eric Douglas (The Flamingo Kid), youngest son of actor Kirk Douglas.Russell plays Tomasina `Tommy' Boyd, a tomboy through and through who spends her days working on cars, shooting hoops with the boys, and riding her motorcycle.  After a fairly schmaltzy and pointless opening sequence showing Tommy as a girl, playing baseball with the boys, scoring a run, and ultimately hugging her father (who was apparently an astronaut in the air force), all done in slow motion montage form, we're now in the present as Tommy rises from bed and proceeds to shower...some skin but no goodies...yet...man, you wouldn't think you could be jealous of a sponge...anyway, Tommy works as a mechanic at Chester's Garage, a dumpy filling station where she's often visited by her girly girl friend Seville (Somers), an aspiring Broadway dancer who seems to have little problem sleazing her way up the ladder of success, as evident later on in the film.  After witnessing a dance audition by Seville and her troupe, one performed for some potential financial backers (surprisingly enough they declined on investing in Seville and her rotten routine), we're back in the garage as big time stock car driver/professional pretty boy Randy Starr (Christopher), who Tommy's got a serious crush on...seems Randy has been hired by a local rich and infinitely sleazy dink named Ernie Leeds, Jr. to race for him, and Randy offers Tommy an invitation to come to Leeds' house to check out his boss stock car.  After this we see Seville auditioning for a donut commercial, whoring it up good, followed by Tommy and Seville heading to Leeds' house where Tommy and Randy race around on motocross bikes (at one point Tommy crashes in a swampy morass, resulting in her revealing her Tommy `guns, if only to get out of her wet clothes...hootchie mama!).  Following this there's a party sequence at Leeds' house (with parachute pants as far as the eye can see), Tommy and Randy hook up, as evident with an overly long montage sequence featuring the pair engaging in all sorts of outdoor activities, but eventually they have a falling out as Tommy shows Randy up on the race track while an important sponsor is in attendance, the result being the pair deciding to race each other to settle once and for all who the best driver is...While the Tomboy is pure 1980s teenage hokum through and through, it fairs better than its counterparts based solely on the presence of Betsy Russell and her generous `assets', along with her willingness to put them on display.  The movie itself actually played like one, long series of Mentos commercials.  One example of this is early on as Tommy is riding her motorcycle to work and she stops off to engage in a game of basketball with some local chumps.  Through a bit of creative editing Russell makes all of her shots, but then here's the kicker...as she's leaving, she climbs aboard her motorcycle and one of the dudes tosses her the ball.  She catches it with one hand, puts it up, and swoosh!  It goes in...as she drives off the yahoos begin high fivin' each other, apparently overjoyed in the fact they've just been emasculated by losing to a girl in their own sport.  I did learn a lot of things from this film, including the following...1. I'd give my left gonasticle to be Betsy Russell's loofa.2. Pretentious, forgettable pop songs from the 1980s, often featured in films like this, generally included meaningless lyrics like `You got the magic, I got the fire'.3. Nothing gets women hotter than chasing them around town in your muscle car, throwing a constant barrage of catcalls in their direction.4. When a sign warns of `severe tire damage', they ain't kidding.5. Untalented bimbos could manage to find success given their willingness to whore it up.6. Someone other than Jimmy `J.J.' Walker actually used the phrase `Dy-no-mite!' in the 1980s.7. When doing a television commercial for donuts the performers actually get paid in donuts.8. Goofy, slow motion montages are a great way to pad out a film.9. When waiting for a woman to meet you for a date it's probably not a good idea to let her walk in on you while you're watching porn as she'll think you're some kind of skeevy perv.10. Apparently, in the world of stock car racing, slapping a jet engine onto your vehicle isn't considered an illegal modification.The performances were passable for a movie like this (although the idea of Betsy Russell as a tomboy seemed a bit farfetched), but the writing is pretty lousy (this one's about as predictable as they come).  I seriously doubt anyone was sitting on the edge of their seat at the end of this one, wondering if plucky Tommy would beat arrogant Randy in the race, thus validating Tommy's belief a woman can do anything as well as a man.  I do love these kinds of films, though, as they take on the superficial mask of female empowerment while passing along copious amounts of nekkid female flesh (Russell's character was the only female that came off remotely decent here).  I did gag a little on some of the schmaltz-laden montages but overall, I'd say this was an entertaining, three star (out of five) feature, and an extra star thrown in for Ms. Russell.The picture quality on this BCI DVD release, presented in widescreen (1.85:1), looks pretty decent, and the Dolby Digital stereo audio comes through well enough.  There aren't any extras, except for a few trailers for some other BCI DVD releases in their Crown International Classics (I wouldn't necessarily refer to some many of them as `classics') series including Hunk (1987), The Beach Girls (1982), Jocks (1987), and My Chauffer (1986).Cookieman108",4,"""Face it honey, you can't be a tomboy all your life.""",1165968000,"12 13,

The movies here range from decent, to pretty damn awful. But there is a few worthy purchases in here. There is 3 discs inside the box, which is a double the size of a single jewel case, and the discs sit inside 3 sleeves, they do not clip in. Thats ok, you would expect something cheaply packaged. The 3 discs are double sided, and contain 2 movies on each of the flip sides. So beware if you hate those double sided discs, you may want to avoid this, although, as I said already, you'd expect these to be as cheap as possible for the quality of these movies.""The Beach Girls"" - 2 and a half stars.Had I not seen this on TV when I was much younger and would sit up to any hour of the night when its classification had ""contains nudity"" along with the title of the film. I think had I not seen it, it would have been a movie here I probably would have passed off as pretty bad acting in a near pointless film about a couple of college babes partying at a friends house on the beach. Sex, drugs and rock n roll all thrown in the mix to make up this typical cheesy 80's film. It has some pretty lame moments, and some music you will wish to forget, but it's one of the better movies in this package. Pointless fun, nothing all that memorable and I have grown out of that stage I just admitted to, so no points for the nudity, unlike some others would give extra stars for.""Cavegirl"" 4 StarsThis is probably the best movie in the whole bunch. A group of high-schoolers go on an excursion to visit some mines for their geography class. The leading man of the movie is a nerd who somehow strays away from the group while exploring some caves and finds a crystal that sends him back to the caveman era. There he meeds Eeba (I think thats her name) and he teaches her some things and ends up falling in love with her. Will he return to his own time or stay with her? Watch it and find out. It's not just a cheesy 80's flick, this one actually had some funny and memorable moments and is not just a cheap boob flick.""Coach"" 2 stars.A seen it before story about a female coach who earns the respect of her pupils. However, unlike in something like ""Wild Cats"" this time around the student and teacher become involved and it ends in a ""That was the best summer of my life"" rubbish.""Hunk"" 2 stars.A goofy, but lame film, about a dweeb who makes a pact with the devil to sell his soul to become a beefed up hunk with everything. But along the ways he wonders if it is worth it or not.""Jocks"" 0 Stars.I couldn't even finish this movie; it's not just because the VHS transfer quality was so bad, it was because it was just boring me to tears that there was nothing going on other than some jocks trying to get laid and always football training.""My Tutor"" - 1.5 Stars.Not sure what the point of this movie was as I kept drifting in and out of consciousness. It stars some guy I recognize, but can't even be bothered to look it up who, so that was pointless for you to read.. it also co-stars an annoying young Crispon Glover. It had that big chested woman some pervs might recognize, but shes not even worth looking at in her small role as a hooker that the boys go to lose their virginity at the brothel of. The main guy's father hires him a tutor, and they get involved... blah, blah, blah. Personally, I thought it did not compare to ""Private Lessons"" and was far more less interesting.""Malibu Beach"" - 1 Stars.I can't even recall this one, so it couldn't have been any good.""The Pom Pom Girls"" 1 star.A pathetic cheerleader movie that tried to be a Porky's 3 plot, but failed at humor, acting ability and entertainment.""Tomboy"" 2 stars.I noticed a lot of praise in reviews from perverts of the 80's who seemed to follow this chicks roles around, just to see her naked. Well, I wont be rating anything based on what body parts are shown... I'm not 12 anymore. This movie is about a tomboy mechanic who meets her Nascar racing idol and falls in love with him. However for pretty much no reason she gets ticked at him and challenges him to a race. A bet is made with his sponsors that if she wins, using her own engine and car that she built herself, then they would use her stock as their racing car. What blows my mind is how stupid you would have to be to beleive this chicks computer and nitro powered jet car would be legal on the Nascar circuit no matter if she wins or not? Knight Rider much?""The Van"" 1 star.Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz""Weekend Pass"" 1 star.4 actors pathetically playing sailors who get a weekend pass while docked and go in search of Californian babes. Nothing memorable to remember, hear, or see. Pathetic from the start, and finish, and probably in the middle where I was yawning and skipping chapters.""My Chauffeur"" - 3 Stars.I'm not sure if this was a decent movie, or it just seemed a lot better then the previous ones I had watched in this pack. It's about a posh limo company who are upper-class gentlemen. Then along comes the female lead, who is hired for unknown reasons at the time to become the first woman to be a driver for the company. The rest of the old farts hate her, except for one or two of them. She's basically a 80's 18-20 year old Madonna wannabe, with the 80's blonde hair, colorful outfits and cheeky attitude. Then she falls in love with the bosses son and some interesting developments occur. Not fantastic, but one of the better flicks here.Overall, it's not a great must see package, but for the price, if you like old cheap 80's boob flicks, mostly set with 20 something year old's playing high-school kids, or college, or just out of school morons, then this cheapo set might interest you. The only movie here I would really recommend would be Cavegirl if it sounds like it might interest you.",3,Not too cool at all.,1335484800,"04 27, 2012",2012,5841,"['price', 'buy', '12', 'movie',
