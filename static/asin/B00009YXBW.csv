The 4 episodes are very good, and include Dora had a little lamb, which is very entertaining, and deals with many of the nursery rhymes our kids see at preschool and look at in books.The menu selection on the DVD is easy, though I wish there was a way to have the episodes repeat or go back to back with one another- when my Mom babysits, she has trouble turning the DVD on, so easier is always better.The DVD also contains some interesting features, like games which I think will be good for my daughter when she gets a little older.",5,A Must for Dora fans to own,1069804800,"11 26, 2003",2003,602,"['2', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'huge', 'Dora', 'fan', 'DVD', '4', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'include', 'Dora', 'had', 'little', 'lamb', 'very', 'entertaining', 'deals', 'many', 'nursery', 'kids', 'see', 'preschool', 'look', 'books.The', 'menu', 'selection', 'DVD', 'easy', 'wish', 'was', 'way', 'have', 'episodes', 'repeat', 'go', 'back', 'back', 'one', 'another-', 'when', 'Mom', 'babysits', 'trouble', 'turning', 'DVD', 'so', 'easier', 'always', 'better.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'interesting', 'features', 'games', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'daughter', 'when', 'little', 'older']",Dora the Explorer - Rhymes and Riddles
