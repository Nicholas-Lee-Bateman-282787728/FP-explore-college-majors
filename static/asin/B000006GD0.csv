Interesting timing?My ultimate view of the movie is that it was a love story.  The love that a man had for his church and for his girl.  Never mind that the girl was a nun-in-training.For me, the confrontation scene in the church just messed with my head - that is - I could actually 'feel' Monsignor Flaherty's agony.  Don't get me wrong, people in the theatre actually laughed, but there was nothing even remotely funny about 'being caught' like that, and the ramifications should have been nothing less than catastrophic for him.For those who termed the movie Campy, Cheesy or whatever other adjectives you may choose to describe this movie, I say get yourself a copy and see for yourself.

493874,A3F0AFTVKFAMZZ,B000006GD0,Marvin D. Pipher,"[0, 0]","This film, set in the latter stages of World War II, has a dual plot in which its main character, Father John Flaherty, played by Christopher Reeve, walks a fine line between good and what many would call evil.  As a priest stationed in the Vatican, he uses his skills as a financial wizard to save the Church from bankruptcy resulting from the war.  He does this by expropriating products from the Vatican commissary, using his contacts with the Italian Mafia to sell them in Rome&#8217;s black market, and returning the Vatican&#8217;s share of the profits to the Church.  He realizes that his actions are not only wrong, but also illegal; but rationalizes that he is doing it for the good of the Church.  His conscience is clear.The plot thickens, however, when the erstwhile Father meets a young novitiate, studying to become a nun; removes the crosses, which signify him as a Chaplin in the US Army, from his uniform; and seduces her.  This, he finds, is not so easily rationalized.  And things go from bad to worse from there.This is an excellent film with great acting, outstanding characterization and in-character dialog, and even better scenery and locale.  Due to its subject matter, however, it is also a difficult film to critique because it can easily be interpreted differently depending on the religious beliefs, or non-beliefs, of the particular viewer.  If the viewer happens to be anti-Catholic, he or she might easy accept this entirely fictional movie as fact and say &#8216;I told you so&#8217;; while, a Catholic, or a religiously inclined viewer, might just as easily be offended by the plot.  If you can set your personal beliefs aside, however, you&#8217;ll find this to be a fine, well-acted, and highly enjoyable film.",5,An excellent film; but hard to critique,1390003200,"01 18, 2014",2014,1746,"['film', 'set', 'latter', 'stages', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'dual', 'plot', 'main', 'character', 'Father', 'John', 'Flaherty', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'fine', 'line', 'good', 'what', 'many', 'would', 'call', 'evil', 'priest', 'stationed', 'Vatican', 'skills', 'financial', 'wizard', 'save', 'Church', 'bankruptcy', 'resulting', 'war', 'expropriating', 'products', 'Vatican', 'commissary', 'using', 'contacts', 'Italian', 'Mafia', 'sell', 'Rome', '8217', 's', 'black', 'market', 'returning', 'Vatican', '8217', 'share', 'profits', 'Church', 'actions', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'wrong', 'also', 'illegal', 'doing', 'good', 'Church', 'conscience', 'clear.The', 'plot', 'thickens', 'however', 'when', 'erstwhile', 'Father', 'young', 'novitiate', 'studying', 'become', 'nun', 'crosses', 'signify', 'Chaplin', 'US', 'Army', 'uniform', 'not', 'so', 'easily', 'rationalized', 'things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'there.This', 'excellent', 'film', 'great', 'acting', 'outstanding', 'characterization', 'in-character', 'dialog', 'even', 'better', 'scenery', 'locale', 'Due', 'subject', 'matter', 'however', 'also', 'difficult', 'film', 'critique', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'interpreted', 'differently', 'depending', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'non-beliefs', 'particular', 'viewer', 'viewer', 'be', 'anti-Catholic', 'might', 'easy', 'entirely', 'fictional', 'movie', 'fact', 'say', '8216', 'told', 'so', '8217', 'Catholic', 'religiously', 'inclined', 'viewer', 'might', 'just', 'easily', 'be', 'offended', 'plot', 'can', 'set', 'personal', 'beliefs', 'aside', 'however', '8217', 'find', 'be', 'fine', 'well-acted', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'film']",Monsignor VHS

Mostly ignored, this film has perhaps a storyline that's rather difficult to believe, but many problems in Christiandom read more like fiction than fact in real life. Some Catholics may be offended by the film.The movie starts out as a young Christopher Reeves, then a chaplin, has to make a choice as the Nazi troups close in, whether to open fire or not, as one of his soldiers dies of a bullet wound. Reeves ends up in the Vatican and through an unusual set of circumstances, relieves the church of its financial woes during WWII by selling Vatican supplies through the black market. He is befriended by a Cardinal, (Fernando Rey) whose performance in this film was perhaps the best of all the cast. Reeves ends up having an affair with the lovely Genevieve Bujold, their first encounter romantic, yet painful. The story continues with Reeves becoming involved in high finance as a bank manager for the Vatican, taking the blame for a multi-million dollar scandal brought on by a rogue mafia operative.The film has been criticized for its fanciful plot, but at least we're not dealing with a child molestation, but a priest making very difficult choices while other priests are quick to condemn.
