281998,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6301971310,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","One of Esther Williams' early starring vehicles is still one of her most delightful and well-remembered.  The plot of 1949's NEPTUNE'S DAUGHTER may be slight in the extreme, but it is the performances and songs underpinning it which give the film its giddy, fun-filled spirit.Esther plays Eve Barrett, a swimmer-turned swimsuit designer, happily married to her career, until her boy-crazy younger sister Betty (Betty Garrett) drags them both headlong into a dizzying romance of confused identities.  As Betty pursues the handsome star player of a visiting South American polo club, she instead mistakenly encounters masseuse Jack Spratt (Red Skelton).  In a bid to quash her sister's foolhardy romantic notions, Eve goes after the REAL polo player, one Jose O'Rourke (Ricardo Montalban), who of course promptly falls for the beautiful career-gal.  Watching from the sideline is Eve's swimsuit partner Joe Backett (Keenan Wynn), who carries his own yen for the oblivious Eve.The plot is as featherlight as tissue paper, but NEPTUNE'S DAUGHTER sparkles like you'd never believe, thanks to composer/lyricist Frank Loesser's unexpected, Academy Award-winning song, ""Baby It's Cold Outside"", the coy duet sung by Esther Williams and Ricardo Montalban.  The performances are all very tight and well-matched.  Happily, Esther had already worked with her co-stars in several films - Red Skelton played her leading man in her very first starring vehicle (1944's ""Bathing Beauty""), whilst Esther had played the twin sister of Ricardo Montalban (1947's ""Fiesta""), starred opposite Keenan Wynn (1946's ""Easy to Wed""); and, in the same year as this film, co-starred with Betty Garrett in ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"".In one of those cute twists, life later imitated art when Esther Williams branched out into her own line of swimwear which is still going strong today.  Surrender to the sweet charm and sunny, funny spirit of this delightful film.",4,Esther delights in frisky Frank Loesser tune-fest,1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,1936,"['One', 'Esther', 'Williams', 'early', 'starring', 'vehicles', 'still', 'one', 'most', 'delightful', 'well-remembered', 'plot', '1949', 'NEPTUNE', 'DAUGHTER', 'may', 'be', 'slight', 'extreme', 'performances', 'songs', 'underpinning', 'give', 'film', 'giddy', 'fun-filled', 'spirit.Esther', 'plays', 'Eve', 'Barrett', 'swimmer-turned', 'swimsuit', 'designer', 'happily', 'married', 'career', 'boy-crazy', 'younger', 'sister', 'Betty', 'Betty', 'Garrett', 'headlong', 'dizzying', 'romance', 'confused', 'identities', 'Betty', 'handsome', 'star', 'player', 'visiting', 'South', 'American', 'polo', 'club', 'instead', 'mistakenly', 'masseuse', 'Jack', 'Spratt', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'bid', 'quash', 'sister', 'foolhardy', 'romantic', 'notions', 'Eve', 'REAL', 'polo', 'player', 'one', 'Jose', ""O'Rourke"", 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'who', 'course', 'promptly', 'beautiful', 'career-gal', 'Watching', 'sideline', 'Eve', 'swimsuit', 'partner', 'Joe', 'Backett', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', 'who', 'own', 'yen', 'oblivious', 'Eve.The', 'plot', 'as', 'featherlight', 'tissue', 'paper', 'NEPTUNE', 'DAUGHTER', 'sparkles', ""'d"", 'never', 'believe', 'thanks', 'composer/lyricist', 'Frank', 'Loesser', 'unexpected', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'song', 'Cold', 'Outside', 'coy', 'duet', 'sung', 'Esther', 'Williams', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'tight', 'well-matched', 'Happily', 'Esther', 'had', 'already', 'worked', 'co-stars', 'several', 'films', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'played', 'leading', 'man', 'very', 'first', 'starring', 'vehicle', '1944', 'Bathing', 'Beauty', 'whilst', 'Esther', 'had', 'played', 'twin', 'sister', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', '1947', 'Fiesta', 'starred', 'opposite', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', '1946', 'Easy', 'Wed', 'same', 'year', 'film', 'co-starred', 'Betty', 'Garrett', 'Take', 'Me', 'Out', 'Ball', 'Game', 'one', 'cute', 'twists', 'life', 'later', 'imitated', 'art', 'when', 'Esther', 'Williams', 'branched', 'out', 'own', 'line', 'swimwear', 'still', 'going', 'strong', 'today', 'Surrender', 'sweet', 'charm', 'sunny', 'funny', 'spirit', 'delightful', 'film']",N/A

As they say, 'in the pool, she's an actress, out of it, she ain't'.  That being said, Williams acquits herself well enough.  Teamed with Ricardo Montalban, there is enough romancing between water ballets to keep the whole affair afloat.  Red Skelton is on hand to perform his 'schtick' and the rest of the usual MGM supporting players all do their best.  The 5 star rating is mainly for the Frank Loesser tune 'Baby, It's Cold Outside' which  is one of the featured musical numbers sung quite nicely by Williams and Montalban.  A fairly lightweight affair but these MGM products had the movie-goers standing in line back in the days.

282005,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6301971310,Randy Keehn,"[0, 1]","I have observed that one of the lesser known stars of the 1950's was a glamorous swimmer named Esther Williams.  Her popularity had waned by the time I started going to the movies but I was reminded from time to time that she and Sonja Heiney (or whatever that ice-skating actress's name was) had a unique appeal for awhile.  I noted that her movie, ""Neptune's Daughter"" won some minor Academy Award (probably for costume design) so I thought I'd see what all the fuss was about.  Fortunately, the cast included Red Skelton because I'm not all that certain I would have enjoyed this movie without his humor.  There was a scene that had me laughing out loud in a room by myself.  It had to do with a Spanish instruction record coming to the end of side one.  Overall, I thought the plot was stretched a little bit thin but, since it was necessary to accommodate Skelton's character, it was OK with me.I noticed at one point that Esther William's ""manager"" was telling her that the show must go on because the audience ""came to see you swim"".  That brought to mind ""The Jackie Gleason Show"" with its' June Taylor dancers.  There was a scene in every show where the dancers did a routine on their backs creating a kalaidescope of pattern and motion visible only from the overhead camera.  I always wondered what the theater audience thought of the ladies appearing to be making snow angels on the stage.  Watching Ms. Williams doing her ""swim dance"" in a pool from an overhead camera angle led me to understand that hers was a talent meant for film and not for stage.  Personally, I prefer Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.",3,Water Polo,1185321600,"07 25, 2007",2007,1618,"['have', 'observed', 'one', 'lesser', 'known', 'stars', '1950', 'was', 'glamorous', 'swimmer', 'named', 'Esther', 'Williams', 'popularity', 'had', 'waned', 'time', 'started', 'going', 'movies', 'was', 'reminded', 'time', 'time', 'Sonja', 'Heiney', 'ice-skating', 'actress', 'name', 'was', 'had', 'unique', 'appeal', 'awhile', 'noted', 'movie', 'Neptune', 'Daughter', 'won', 'minor', 'Academy', 'Award', 'probably', 'costume', 'design', 'thought', ""'d"", 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'about', 'Fortunately', 'cast', 'included', 'Red', 'Skelton', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'humor', 'was', 'scene', 'had', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'room', 'had', 'do', 'Spanish', 'instruction', 'record', 'coming', 'end', 'side', 'one', 'Overall', 'thought', 'plot', 'was', 'stretched', 'little', 'bit', 'thin', 'was', 'necessary', 'accommodate', 'Skelton', 'character', 'was', 'OK', 'me.I', 'noticed', 'one', 'point', 'Esther', 'William', 'manager', 'was', 'telling', 'show', 'must', 'go', 'audience', 'came', 'see', 'swim', 'brought', 'mind', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'Show', 'June', 'Taylor', 'dancers', 'was', 'scene', 'show', 'where', 'dancers', 'did', 'routine', 'backs', 'creating', 'kalaidescope', 'pattern', 'motion', 'visible', 'only', 'overhead', 'camera', 'always', 'wondered', 'what', 'theater', 'audience', 'thought', 'ladies', 'appearing', 'be', 'making', 'snow', 'angels', 'stage', 'Watching', 'Ms.', 'Williams', 'doing', 'swim', 'dance', 'pool', 'overhead', 'camera', 'angle', 'led', 'understand', 'hers', 'was', 'talent', 'meant', 'film', 'not', 'stage', 'Personally', 'prefer', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Ginger', 'Rogers']",N/A
282006,A1R7RSAMR1ST5M,6301971310,R.M.,"[14, 17]","Neptune's Daughter is a farcical story of an Olympic swimmer named Eve who becomes a swimsuit designer.  As a result of her beauty and talent in the pool, a businessman proposes that Eve join his swimsuit firm as head designer and model.  Ester Williams as Eve plays the part of the 'trained seal' who designs the swimsuits.  Her other charge is her little sister Betty, an unhappily unmarried woman determined to do just about anything to rectify her man-less situation.  As we can see, poor Eve has her hands full.  Not only is she a competent career woman, she must also baby-sit Betty as she throws herself at the South American polo team (appropriately coming to town for the North-South American polo match that month).  Of course, the handsome man comes along (Jos&egrave;, the captain of said polo team) and despite many silly mix-ups, all works out in the end: Eve and Betty both get married to their respective men and the world is set straight again.The movie's premise is beyond hope: of course an amateur swimmer who looks good in bathing suits becomes an overworked businesswoman in need for some serious love.  Her outfits and glasses show that as a career woman, she cannot possibly have any fun.  Though her suits are sexy, Eve in the workplace is not.  She is hard at work and, as demanded by her boss in a personal manner, puts her work first.  Of course, this unnatural state of composure and (heaven forbid) power is obviously all wrong.  She needs a man to revive her romantic and womanly personality (for surely she cannot be both romantic and dedicated to her profession).  Though Jos&egrave; is a seducer at best, this time his intentions are `honorable.' It being the 1940's, Eve must accept his proposal because she cannot be a true woman otherwise.  Thankfully, she does accept, and we end with the obligatory swimming delights.  Eve and Jos&egrave; dive and leap and swim in perfect synchrony, their happy partnership in the water supposedly mimicking their future together.  Of course, any Esther Williams fan will love this movie-not only does she look good in her bathing suit, but she looks extremely sharp in all her other outfits as well.  Esther Williams in any kind of suit is a gold star as far as I'm concerned",3,Typical Esther Williams,1045785600,"02 21, 2003",2003,2249,"['Neptune', 'Daughter', 'farcical', 'story', 'Olympic', 'swimmer', 'named', 'Eve', 'who', 'swimsuit', 'designer', 'result', 'beauty', 'talent', 'pool', 'businessman', 'Eve', 'join', 'swimsuit', 'firm', 'head', 'designer', 'model', 'Ester', 'Williams', 'Eve', 'part', ""'trained"", 'seal', 'who', 'designs', 'swimsuits', 'other', 'charge', 'little', 'sister', 'Betty', 'unhappily', 'unmarried', 'woman', 'determined', 'do', 'just', 'anything', 'rectify', 'man-less', 'situation', 'can', 'see', 'poor', 'Eve', 'hands', 'full', 'Not', 'only', 'competent', 'career', 'woman', 'must', 'also', 'baby-sit', 'Betty', 'South', 'American', 'polo', 'team', 'appropriately', 'coming', 'town', 'North-South', 'American', 'polo', 'match', 'month', 'course', 'handsome', 'man', 'along', 'Jos', 'egrave', 'captain', 'said', 'polo', 'team', 'many', 'silly', 'mix-ups', 'out', 'end', 'Eve', 'Betty', 'get', 'married', 'respective', 'men', 'world', 'set', 'straight', 'again.The', 'movie', 'premise', 'hope', 'course', 'amateur', 'swimmer', 'who', 'good', 'bathing', 'suits', 'overworked', 'businesswoman', 'need', 'serious', 'love', 'outfits', 'glasses', 'show', 'career', 'woman', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'have', 'fun', 'suits', 'are', 'sexy', 'Eve', 'workplace', 'not', 'hard', 'work', 'demanded', 'boss', 'personal', 'manner', 'work', 'first', 'course', 'unnatural', 'state', 'composure', 'heaven', 'forbid', 'power', 'obviously', 'wrong', 'man', 'revive', 'romantic', 'womanly', 'personality', 'surely', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'romantic', 'dedicated', 'profession', 'Jos', 'egrave', 'seducer', 'best', 'time', 'intentions', 'are', 'honorable', 'being', '1940', 'Eve', 'must', 'accept', 'proposal', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'woman', 'otherwise', 'Thankfully', 'accept', 'end', 'obligatory', 'swimming', 'delights', 'Eve', 'Jos', 'egrave', 'dive', 'leap', 'swim', 'perfect', 'synchrony', 'happy', 'partnership', 'water', 'supposedly', 'mimicking', 'future', 'together', 'course', 'Esther', 'Williams', 'fan', 'will', 'love', 'movie-not', 'only', 'look', 'good', 'bathing', 'suit', 'extremely', 'sharp', 'other', 'outfits', 'well', 'Esther', 'Williams', 'kind', 'suit', 'gold', 'star', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned']",N/A

So when I saw NEPTUNE'S DAUGHTER was on the channel next, AND was a musical, I took the time to watch it ...And, sad to say, I just didn't like the film.  =0(  I""ma HUGE classic film buff, and in the beginning I was inspired by the cast of this one: Williams, Betty Garrett, Red Skelton, Keenan Wynn, and a very young and VERY handsome Ricardo Montalban - all actors I like.  Here Williams plays a swimwear designer, Garrett her unmarried sister seeking a husband.  When the South American polo team comes to town, led by the incomparable Jose O'Rourke (Montalban), Garrett reads about the match in the newspaper and is determined to land a South American husband.  Having not seen a photo of O'Rourke, she manages to mistake Red Skelton - recently coached on the ways of wooing women by Montalban - for the celebrity polo player, and wackiness ensues when Montalban meets and falls for Williams ... while Williams only goes out with him to keep him from going out with her sister, whom she believes he's seeing and will eventually use and throw away.Hope I explained that effectively enough, but for me the mistaken identity gag never really worked (who'd mistake the flaming-haired RED Skelton as a South American polo player?!), and even though she thinks he's dating her sister - AND despises him for the womanizer she believes him to be - it's absolutely NUTS how fast and hard Williams' character falls for Montalban's character; nuts even by classic Hollywood melodrama standards!  There are some funny scenes, mostly thanks to Skelton (the scene where he actually has to play polo is kind of neat), and the musical numbers work nicely (especially ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"") ... but for the last third of this film I was just sort of not into what I was seeing, and waiting for it to end.
