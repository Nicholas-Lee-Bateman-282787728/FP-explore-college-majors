I first got into Jim Gaffigan when Mr. Universe came out (and then I sort of back-tracked and watched some of his older specials like &#34;King Baby&#34; and &#34;Beyond that Pale&#34; which were both hysterical) and I honestly couldn't enjoy his comedy more; everything is so relatable and all of his sets just glide into one another, like you're having a conversation with him.  This special was just as funny, if not funnier than Mr. Universe and I'd HIGHLY recommend buying! &#34;Obsessed&#34; is good clean fun for the whole family and will have you wondering why you didn't get into him before!
