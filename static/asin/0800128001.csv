They try to breathe life (pardon the pun) into the already played-out premise of carting a dead body around, by giving Dead Bernie the power to walk via voodoo.  The ENTIRE move is hung on that premise, with predictably lame results.  Man, where do I start?  The silly, repetitive ""island"" music that plays every time Bernie shuffles into a scene?  The amazingly stupid, pop-eyed expression Andrew McCarthy wears throughout the film, like he's auditioning for the white-boy Mantan Moreland role (hard to believe that just a few years earlier, he put in a sensitive, complex performance in ""Pretty In Pink"".  This movie buried him in Hollywood)?  The seemingly tacked-on ""Jamaican Princess"" love interest scenes, a woman who in reality would never have anything to do with those two idiots?  I laughed out loud exactly ONCE during this film:  near the beginning, when two vacationing soul brothers wander into a voodoo ceremony, mistaking it for a party.  One of them walks up to a worshiper in the throes of a voodoo spell, and yells, ""Yo, Homes, where's the Scotch?""  Other than that, this movie is a yawn festival.

A cult classic comedy loaded with humor, crazy situations, and kept the audience involved the entire time.  ""Weekend at Bernie's Part II"" had some great moments, but this movie seemed to go in the wrong direction.To make a sequel enjoyable, the viewers need more from the first film to make a connection.  Only Richard, Larry, and Bernie were back.  Where were many of the major characters from the first film??  The mob boss, the girlfriend who was fooling around with Bernie, and Gwen, who was Richard's love interest, should have been back to build the story.  Even some of Bernie's beach pals (remember the nut who wanted his car?) could have made cameos.This time, however, things changed for the worse.  Barry Bostwick was essentially the ""new"" Paulie (who was the hit man in part I) and did a horrible horrible job.  Paulie should have returned in some way or form.  Can you say prison breakout?Instead of Richard having a love interest or continuing things with Gwen, this time it was Larry trying to make it with the girl on the island.  HUGE mistake, as there was no chemistry or any sense that the relationship might have worked.  Larry seemed way to silly to even attempt date or romantic scenes!!  Not even close to believable.I fully agree with one viewer who suggested that Terry Kiser (Bernie), who was hilarious when he was alive, should have been in Part II in a flashback mode or something playing the part of the living Bernie.  He was great in the first one and had very little chance to improve the part this time.The two clowns who were chasing Bernie's body around and carried out the voodoo were terrible.  The whole idea of voodoo was super silly, except for it giving Bernie a chance to move around a bit and not be a lifeless corpse the whole time.Also, the soundtrack for Part II was awful!  The first one had great party/beach music.  Why not capitalize on that?  Who could forget the ""some like it hot/cold/never know"" song from the first one?  Just another example of how the writer-turned-director (he wrote the first and directed this one) helped make this movie tumble.WAB fans should still see it but true comedy happened in the first film.",2,The opportunity for a good sequel was there.......,1068422400,"11 10, 2003",2003,2295,"['.but', 'hopes', 'were', 'dashed', 'when', 'said', 'quot', 'Action', 'quot', 'first', 'Weekend', 'Bernie', 'was', 'absolute', 'hit', 'cult', 'classic', 'comedy', 'loaded', 'humor', 'crazy', 'situations', 'kept', 'audience', 'involved', 'entire', 'time', 'Weekend', 'Bernie', 'Part', 'II', 'had', 'great', 'moments', 'movie', 'seemed', 'go', 'wrong', 'direction.To', 'make', 'sequel', 'enjoyable', 'viewers', 'need', 'more', 'first', 'film', 'make', 'connection', 'Only', 'Richard', 'Larry', 'Bernie', 'were', 'back', 'Where', 'were', 'many', 'major', 'characters', 'first', 'film', 'mob', 'boss', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'was', 'fooling', 'around', 'Bernie', 'Gwen', 'who', 'was', 'Richard', 'love', 'interest', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'back', 'build', 'story', 'Even', 'Bernie', 'beach', 'pals', 'remember', 'nut', 'who', 'wanted', 'car', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'cameos.This', 'time', 'however', 'things', 'changed', 'worse', 'Barry', 'Bostwick', 'was', 'essentially', 'new', 'Paulie', 'who', 'was', 'hit', 'man', 'part', 'did', 'horrible', 'horrible', 'job', 'Paulie', 'should', 'have', 'returned', 'way', 'form', 'Can', 'say', 'prison', 'Instead', 'Richard', 'having', 'love', 'interest', 'continuing', 'things', 'Gwen', 'time', 'was', 'Larry', 'trying', 'make', 'girl', 'island', 'HUGE', 'mistake', 'was', 'chemistry', 'sense', 'relationship', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'Larry', 'seemed', 'way', 'silly', 'even', 'attempt', 'date', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'Not', 'even', 'close', 'believable.I', 'fully', 'agree', 'one', 'viewer', 'who', 'suggested', 'Terry', 'Kiser', 'Bernie', 'who', 'was', 'hilarious', 'when', 'was', 'alive', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Part', 'II', 'flashback', 'mode', 'something', 'playing', 'part', 'living', 'Bernie', 'was', 'great', 'first', 'one', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'chance', 'improve', 'part', 'time.The', 'two', 'clowns', 'who', 'were', 'chasing', 'Bernie', 'body', 'around', 'carried', 'voodoo', 'were', 'terrible', 'whole', 'idea', 'voodoo', 'was', 'super', 'silly', 'giving', 'Bernie', 'chance', 'move', 'bit', 'not', 'be', 'lifeless', 'corpse', 'whole', 'time.Also', 'soundtrack', 'Part', 'II', 'was', 'awful', 'first', 'one', 'had', 'great', 'party/beach', 'music', 'Why', 'not', 'capitalize', 'Who', 'could', 'forget', 'hot/cold/never', 'know', 'song', 'first', 'one', 'Just', 'example', 'how', 'writer-turned-director', 'wrote', 'first', 'directed', 'one', 'helped', 'make', 'movie', 'tumble.WAB', 'fans', 'should', 'still', 'see', 'true', 'comedy', 'happened', 'first', 'film']",N/A

A week after the madness, Richard and Larry need to prove they didn't steal the money, so they take Bernie's body from the morgue and go to the Virgin Islands. Charles and Henry got hold of Bernie before Richard and Larry and performed Voodoo in order to bring Bernie back from the dead, so they can find the money. Unfortunately, they do it wrong and can only walk when music is playing. Will zombie Bernie lead the guys to the money before Richard dies from a poisonous drink?
