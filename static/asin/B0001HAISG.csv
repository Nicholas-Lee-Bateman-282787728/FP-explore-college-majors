805762,AVT2CST57MKDL,B0001HAISG,Abby,"[13, 16]","""Peter Pan"" is a beautifully done movie. The effects, first of all, are amazing, and very tasteful. Director P.J. Hogan could have opted for gosh-wow edge of your seat exsplosive special effects throughout the film, but instead opted for effects that were still breathtaking, but just a little more subtle, and this gives the movie a graceful, seamless look to it.The characters have all been very well cast, from Wendy (Rachael Hurd-Wood, who acts with surprising maturity for being so young) to Peter (Jeremy Sumpter, who stays very much in character the whole film). But the most remarkable character is Captain Hook (Jason Isaacs).Isaacs' Hook shows us a completely different side of a character who many of us previously thought was totally evil. While Peter and Tink get on the audience's nerves, Hook gives us a layered portrait of a villain who really wouldn't be all that bad if someone just gave him a chance. In him, we see a tortured, embittered soul, who is constantly conniving and plotting Pan's demise. The film shows us two reasons for this, giving the character a nice bit of depth that was not previously there. Reason one: Pan cut off his hand and fed it to a crocodile. Reason two: Hook is lonely. He has nobody who cares about him whatsoever. Pan not only has the Lost Boys, but he has brought along Wendy Darling, a teller of tales, and her two brothers (adorably played by Harry Newell and Freddie Popplewell). In fact, Hook is such a fascinating character that when Pan and his sidekick Tinkerbell (Ludivine Sagnier, being more annoying than I thought was possible even by fairy standards)come in to save the day, you feel like they're ruining the fun. Isaacs' Hook had me so impressed that I was secretly rooting for the bad guy to win.Other notable performances: The Lost Boys, and even a few of the pirates, provide several funny moments. Slightly(Theodore Chester) probably gives some of the best lines of all, and John(Newell) and Michael(Popplewell) also have several funny scenes.""Peter Pan"" is an artful, tasteful movie, and is certainly worth a look for these reasons alone, but unfortunately, when good finally triumphs over evil, you leave the theater wondering if there couldn't have been some compromise between the two forces.",3,Captain Hook never looked so good,1072656000,"12 29, 2003",2003,2265,"['Peter', 'Pan', 'beautifully', 'done', 'movie', 'effects', 'first', 'are', 'amazing', 'very', 'tasteful', 'Director', 'P.J', 'Hogan', 'could', 'have', 'opted', 'gosh-wow', 'edge', 'seat', 'exsplosive', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'instead', 'opted', 'effects', 'were', 'still', 'breathtaking', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'subtle', 'movie', 'graceful', 'seamless', 'look', 'it.The', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'well', 'cast', 'Wendy', 'Rachael', 'Hurd-Wood', 'who', 'surprising', 'maturity', 'being', 'so', 'young', 'Peter', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'character', 'whole', 'film', 'most', 'remarkable', 'character', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', '.Isaacs', 'Hook', 'completely', 'different', 'side', 'character', 'who', 'many', 'previously', 'thought', 'was', 'totally', 'evil', 'Peter', 'Tink', 'get', 'audience', 'nerves', 'Hook', 'layered', 'portrait', 'villain', 'who', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'someone', 'just', 'gave', 'chance', 'see', 'tortured', 'embittered', 'soul', 'who', 'constantly', 'conniving', 'plotting', 'Pan', 'demise', 'film', 'two', 'reasons', 'giving', 'character', 'nice', 'bit', 'depth', 'was', 'not', 'previously', 'there', 'Reason', 'one', 'Pan', 'cut', 'off', 'hand', 'fed', 'crocodile', 'Reason', 'two', 'Hook', 'lonely', 'nobody', 'who', 'whatsoever', 'Pan', 'not', 'only', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'brought', 'Wendy', 'Darling', 'teller', 'tales', 'two', 'brothers', 'adorably', 'played', 'Harry', 'Newell', 'Freddie', 'Popplewell', 'fact', 'Hook', 'such', 'fascinating', 'character', 'when', 'Pan', 'sidekick', 'Tinkerbell', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'being', 'more', 'annoying', 'thought', 'was', 'possible', 'even', 'fairy', 'standards', 'come', 'save', 'day', 'feel', ""'re"", 'ruining', 'fun', 'Isaacs', 'Hook', 'had', 'so', 'impressed', 'was', 'secretly', 'rooting', 'bad', 'guy', 'win.Other', 'notable', 'performances', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'even', 'few', 'pirates', 'provide', 'several', 'funny', 'moments', 'Slightly', 'Theodore', 'Chester', 'probably', 'best', 'lines', 'John', 'Newell', 'Michael', 'Popplewell', 'also', 'have', 'several', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'artful', 'tasteful', 'movie', 'certainly', 'worth', 'look', 'reasons', 'alone', 'unfortunately', 'when', 'good', 'finally', 'evil', 'leave', 'theater', 'wondering', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'compromise', 'two', 'forces']",N/A

805767,A1JDRNIJK40FMZ,B0001HAISG,alp106,"[1, 1]","Before I saw this movie, I was frankly sceptical.  The previous versions of Peter Pan that I had seen I had classified as dumb (the Mary Martin version) and kiddy-ish (the animated 1950's version).  I was delighted when I found that Peter Pan is played by a boy in this version, and my delight grew as I watched this cinematic treat.I have read the original book by J.M. Barrie, and I greatly enjoyed it, especially the 'lost boys' angle.  Most of this movie stays true to the book, including some of the dialogue and personalities.  Aunt Millicent is a surprise, but a pleasant one.  Jeremy Sumpter as Peter Pan is perfect--he is the roguish charmer that I always pictured when reading the book.  And Wendy--I couldn't ask for a better actress!  Jason Isaacs was also delightful.  In short, I thought the cast was superb, down to the pirates and British elite.At first I was taken aback by the childish romance between Peter and Wendy, but I was pleased; I had always secretly wanted their relationship to develope a little more.  And I understood why Peter had to return to Neverland, even though he had found something to love in Wendy.  I LOVED the moment when Wendy gave Peter the 'hidden kiss', and Peter turns pink and eventually shoots upward into the sky.  That's magic.  Your heart just can't help racing.  I also loved Hook's expression: &#34;Split my infinitives!&#34;  Oh, that made me laugh!And when I finished watching it, I thought, &#34;This is how I've always pictured Peter Pan--the romance, the adventure, the paradox of 'growing up'.  Something that delights children but also appeals to adults.  It's almost perfect.&#34;I say 'almost'.  If there's one thing I would change--there's quite a bit of bare skin in this production, if you get the point.  That would be the one thing that would make me hesitate to show this to my little sister.  I understood why the producers had Peter dress that way, to make him seem like a mythical character, not unlike the Roman god Pan, but I wish he had a little more on for the sake of any little children who watch this movie.Otherwise, I just love it, and I'll watch this often.",5,To Live would be an Awfully Big Adventure,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,2140,"['saw', 'movie', 'was', 'frankly', 'sceptical', 'previous', 'versions', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'had', 'seen', 'had', 'classified', 'dumb', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'version', 'kiddy-ish', 'animated', '1950', 'version', 'was', 'delighted', 'when', 'found', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'played', 'boy', 'version', 'delight', 'grew', 'watched', 'cinematic', 'treat.I', 'have', 'read', 'original', 'book', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'especially', ""'lost"", 'boys', 'angle', 'Most', 'movie', 'true', 'book', 'including', 'dialogue', 'personalities', 'Aunt', 'Millicent', 'surprise', 'pleasant', 'one', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'perfect', 'roguish', 'charmer', 'always', 'pictured', 'when', 'reading', 'book', 'Wendy', 'could', ""n't"", 'ask', 'better', 'actress', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'was', 'also', 'delightful', 'short', 'thought', 'cast', 'was', 'superb', 'down', 'pirates', 'British', 'elite.At', 'first', 'was', 'taken', 'aback', 'childish', 'romance', 'Peter', 'Wendy', 'was', 'pleased', 'had', 'always', 'secretly', 'wanted', 'relationship', 'develope', 'little', 'more', 'understood', 'why', 'Peter', 'had', 'return', 'Neverland', 'even', 'had', 'found', 'something', 'love', 'Wendy', 'LOVED', 'moment', 'when', 'Wendy', 'gave', 'Peter', ""'hidden"", 'kiss', 'Peter', 'pink', 'eventually', 'shoots', 'upward', 'sky', 'magic', 'heart', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'racing', 'also', 'loved', 'Hook', 'expression', '34', 'Split', 'infinitives', '34', 'Oh', 'made', 'when', 'finished', 'watching', 'thought', '34', 'how', ""'ve"", 'always', 'pictured', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'romance', 'adventure', 'paradox', ""'growing"", 'up', 'Something', 'delights', 'children', 'also', 'appeals', 'adults', 'almost', 'perfect.', '34', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'would', 'change', 'quite', 'bit', 'bare', 'skin', 'production', 'get', 'point', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'thing', 'would', 'make', 'hesitate', 'show', 'little', 'sister', 'understood', 'why', 'producers', 'had', 'Peter', 'dress', 'way', 'make', 'seem', 'mythical', 'character', 'not', 'Roman', 'god', 'Pan', 'wish', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'sake', 'little', 'children', 'who', 'watch', 'movie.Otherwise', 'just', 'love', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'often']",N/A

It was average to most people, and wasn't very memorable at all, and possibly for good reason.The acting was sub-average on many parts, with a boring plot, and it was essentially nothing but a live-action adaption of the original Peter Pan, with some very adult changes.For one, the Lost Boys and Peter Pan appear to be obsessed with death and killing, as their first reaction to seeing Wendy flying in the air is ""kill it!"" and when she falls to the ground unconscious, they are narrowly stopped from killing her by Peter Pan.  Hook is a mad bloodlusted butcher constantly killing crew members at random moments, offing at least three or four of them during the scene where Wendy is telling a story.  Several fairies also die, quite comically, but die nonetheless.Pan also appears to be someone's bad idea of a character created on drugs.  He not only has no cares, but appears to care about absolutely nothing, and has a constant ""whoa"" attitude to him.  He also frequently forgets peoples' names, even after being told their names less than a few minutes before.  He's obsessed with killing, and frequently threatens to kill various Lost Boys.There's also a lot of pre-teen sexual energy going on between Peter Pan and Wendy, so potent that it's really quite sick.All in all, this was a quite pointless adaptation, with lots of violence, drug innuendo, and at least a dozen or so corpses by the end of the film.",1,"Not only boring, but with so much adult innuendo as to be not for kids at all!",1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,1481,"['So', 'live-action', 'adaptation', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'again', 'came', 'faded', 'was', 'average', 'most', 'people', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'memorable', 'possibly', 'good', 'reason.The', 'acting', 'was', 'sub-average', 'many', 'parts', 'boring', 'plot', 'was', 'essentially', 'nothing', 'live-action', 'adaption', 'original', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'very', 'adult', 'changes.For', 'one', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'appear', 'be', 'obsessed', 'death', 'killing', 'first', 'reaction', 'seeing', 'Wendy', 'flying', 'air', 'kill', 'when', 'ground', 'unconscious', 'are', 'narrowly', 'stopped', 'killing', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Hook', 'mad', 'bloodlusted', 'butcher', 'constantly', 'killing', 'crew', 'members', 'random', 'moments', 'offing', 'least', 'three', 'four', 'scene', 'where', 'Wendy', 'telling', 'story', 'Several', 'fairies', 'also', 'die', 'quite', 'comically', 'die', 'nonetheless.Pan', 'also', 'be', 'someone', 'bad', 'idea', 'character', 'created', 'drugs', 'not', 'only', 'cares', 'care', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'constant', 'whoa', 'attitude', 'also', 'frequently', 'peoples', 'names', 'even', 'being', 'told', 'names', 'less', 'few', 'minutes', 'before', 'obsessed', 'killing', 'frequently', 'kill', 'various', 'Lost', 'Boys.There', 'also', 'lot', 'pre-teen', 'sexual', 'energy', 'going', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Wendy', 'so', 'potent', 'really', 'quite', 'sick.All', 'was', 'quite', 'pointless', 'adaptation', 'lots', 'violence', 'drug', 'innuendo', 'least', 'dozen', 'so', 'corpses', 'end', 'film']",N/A

Ryan ""Merribelle""","[2, 6]","This is the Peter Pan you've always wanted to see; you just never knew it could be done so beautifully.I admit to having read the book as a child.  Yes, I am one of those people who has *expectations* before I go see certain films that are based on books.  Usually, those films disappoint me, but in the case of Peter Pan (2003 version) I was delighted.  This Peter Pan truly captured the magical world of Neverland and the childlike spirit of the original story that I remember.It's hard to imagine that there's anybody in the English speaking world who doesn't know this story, but all the same, here's a summary of the plot:  three Victorian children telling stories of adventure in their nursery attract the attention of a magical, extraordinary boy - Peter Pan.  He's a runaway that somehow managed to find his way to a magical otherworld called Neverland, where he will never grow up and more or less rules as the chief of wild boys like himself.  His friend Tinkerbell, a fairy, gives him the ability to fly; but his great talents and cleverness are what makes him extraordinary.  Peter Pan decides to steal the children away to Neverland with him because he can't get enough of the girl's stories. Truthfully, there's a part of him that misses having a mother and in some way she represents a little of that to him and the other Wild Boys.  Unfortunately, his nemesis Captain Hook has plans of his own to steal the children and raise them as pirates.  So the tale is set up for a great deal of adventure and wonder as the wild boy tribe and all the other inhabitants of Neverland take on the pirates to determine who will rule in the end.The special effects were flawless in this film.  The actors were all perfectly cast, especially Jason Isaacs as that impish King of the Wild Boys, Peter.  The art direction was just right for this story, a mixture of whimsy and delight.  I felt that the occasional narration by Vanessa Redgrave added a nice touch and really helped to preserve the essence of the original story's subtle wit and charm. This version of Peter Pan will appeal to a wide age range, including older children and adults.

805779,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,B0001HAISG,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[4, 6]","In November 2003, I was stoked to learn that Peter Pan would be re-told in the way that author J.M. Barrie intended. The good, the bad, and the ugly. Peter Pan is not just some cutesy tale. There is meaning and feeling, which makes this fantasy the best of all fantasies. I saw the film three times in the theater, and I don't regret one penny I spent seeing it.While it's fantastic on the big screen, it's still fantastic on the small screen in your living room. Most people know the story-- Peter Pan is a boy who refuses to grow up. He meets Wendy, Michael, and John Darling, whisks them away to the magical Neverland and have rip-roaring adventures together. Never did I think a film could capture the book so well. This movie does exactly that, and nothing could be better.It's colorful, it beautiful, and the flying looks real. They're not on strings, Peter Pan is not played by a girl (Thank God!), and Tinkerbell is not just a flashlight on a wall. Peter is played by the marvelous Jeremy Sumpter, who is also in the film &quot;Frailty.&quot; He proves himself in both movies. He's the most amazing Pan you'll ever have the pleasure to see. Newcomer Rachel Hurd-Wood plays Wendy. She brings new life to the character of Wendy. And then there is Jason Isaacs. He plays both Captain Hook and Mr. Darling, creating a Hook that is more memorable than ever before.The DVD features are alright, I bought the movie just for the movie, not the features. The features give insight on the making of the film, which is interesting, but some of them are so short (less than two minutes on one!) that I wonder why they were even included on the DVD.Definitely get this movie. It's perfectly for all ages, all types. It doesn't matter who you are-- the theme and meaning of Peter Pan is something that we can all relate to. The visuals are great, fantastic acting, awesome musical score (in which case, you might want to check out the soundtrack sometime!)-- overall just a wonderful film that you'll watch again and again.",5,You'll Want to Watch it Again and Again,1084838400,"05 18, 2004",2004,2017,"['November', '2003', 'was', 'stoked', 'learn', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'would', 'be', 're-told', 'way', 'author', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'intended', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'not', 'just', 'cutesy', 'tale', 'meaning', 'feeling', 'best', 'fantasies', 'saw', 'film', 'three', 'times', 'theater', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'one', 'penny', 'spent', 'seeing', 'fantastic', 'big', 'screen', 'still', 'fantastic', 'small', 'screen', 'living', 'room', 'Most', 'people', 'know', 'story', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'boy', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'Wendy', 'Michael', 'John', 'Darling', 'away', 'magical', 'Neverland', 'have', 'rip-roaring', 'adventures', 'together', 'Never', 'did', 'think', 'film', 'could', 'capture', 'book', 'so', 'well', 'movie', 'exactly', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'better.It', 'colorful', 'beautiful', 'flying', 'looks', 'real', ""'re"", 'not', 'strings', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'not', 'played', 'girl', 'Thank', 'God', 'Tinkerbell', 'not', 'just', 'flashlight', 'wall', 'Peter', 'played', 'marvelous', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', 'who', 'also', 'film', 'quot', 'Frailty.', 'quot', 'movies', 'most', 'amazing', 'Pan', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'have', 'pleasure', 'see', 'Newcomer', 'Rachel', 'Hurd-Wood', 'Wendy', 'new', 'life', 'character', 'Wendy', 'then', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'Mr', 'Darling', 'creating', 'Hook', 'more', 'memorable', 'ever', 'before.The', 'DVD', 'features', 'are', 'alright', 'bought', 'movie', 'just', 'movie', 'not', 'features', 'features', 'give', 'insight', 'making', 'film', 'interesting', 'are', 'so', 'short', 'less', 'two', 'minutes', 'one', 'wonder', 'why', 'were', 'even', 'included', 'DVD.Definitely', 'get', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'ages', 'types', ""n't"", 'matter', 'who', 'are', 'theme', 'meaning', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'something', 'can', 'relate', 'visuals', 'are', 'great', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'awesome', 'musical', 'score', 'case', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'soundtrack', 'sometime', 'overall', 'just', 'wonderful', 'film', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again', 'again']",N/A

Imagine my *delight* at seeing yet another version (sarcasm here) when the film came out in theaters.  I have to admit, however, that I was immediately and continuously impressed by this superb adaptation of J.M. Barrie's classic children's tale, and bought the dvd as soon as it came out.The cast is absolutely perfect.  Jeremy Sumpter in the title role is wonderful, bringing a mischievous energy and boyishness to the part that has been amazingly and consistently missing (having been played by Mary Martin and Robin Williams).  I'll also single out Rachel Hurd-Wood as Wendy and Jason Isaacs as Captain Hook/Mr. Darling for their great performances, but the entire cast is terrific.The script is spectacular, exploring the subtext of the Pan story in a simple but profound way that puts film critics' shameless psycho-jargon to shame.  It is the kernel of truth wrapped round a rousing adventure story -- replete with cruel pirates, brave Indians, sinister mermaids and loyal parents. Captain Hook's cruelty is evident, but takes place mostly off-screen and is never gory.  This is a thinking (little) person's Peter Pan, certainly, drawing as it does on previously unexplored themes of the complexity of growing up, the consequences of our choices, and the acceptance of our children as they grow up, but it's also a gorgeous realization of Barrie's (and Wendy's) fantastical imagination.DVD extras are quite entertaining and include: an alternate ending, deleted scenes, Jason Isaacs' video diary, &quot;The Legacy of Pan&quot; with Sarah Ferguson, and a number of micro-minifeaturettes on flying, sets, etc.  Too bad it lacks a commentary track but otherwise lots of fun.For Pan fans, highest possible recommendation;for all others, see above.",5,flawless adaptation of this children's classic,1086307200,"06 4, 2004",2004,1832,"['have', 'child', 'have', 'seen', 'EVERY', 'version', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'made', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'Imagine', '*delight*', 'seeing', 'yet', 'version', 'sarcasm', 'here', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'have', 'admit', 'however', 'was', 'immediately', 'continuously', 'impressed', 'superb', 'adaptation', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'classic', 'children', 'tale', 'bought', 'dvd', 'as', 'soon', 'came', 'out.The', 'cast', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', 'title', 'role', 'wonderful', 'bringing', 'mischievous', 'energy', 'boyishness', 'part', 'been', 'amazingly', 'consistently', 'missing', 'having', 'been', 'played', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'Robin', 'Williams', ""'ll"", 'also', 'single', 'out', 'Rachel', 'Hurd-Wood', 'Wendy', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'Captain', 'Hook/Mr', 'Darling', 'great', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'terrific.The', 'script', 'spectacular', 'exploring', 'subtext', 'Pan', 'story', 'simple', 'profound', 'way', 'film', 'critics', 'shameless', 'psycho-jargon', 'shame', 'kernel', 'truth', 'wrapped', 'round', 'rousing', 'adventure', 'story', 'replete', 'cruel', 'pirates', 'brave', 'Indians', 'sinister', 'mermaids', 'loyal', 'parents', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'cruelty', 'evident', 'place', 'mostly', 'off-screen', 'never', 'gory', 'thinking', 'little', 'person', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'certainly', 'drawing', 'previously', 'unexplored', 'themes', 'complexity', 'growing', 'up', 'consequences', 'choices', 'acceptance', 'children', 'grow', 'up', 'also', 'gorgeous', 'realization', 'Barrie', 'Wendy', 'fantastical', 'imagination.DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'include', 'alternate', 'ending', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'video', 'diary', 'quot', 'Legacy', 'Pan', 'quot', 'Sarah', 'Ferguson', 'number', 'micro-minifeaturettes', 'flying', 'sets', 'etc', 'Too', 'bad', 'commentary', 'track', 'otherwise', 'lots', 'fun.For', 'Pan', 'fans', 'highest', 'possible', 'recommendation', 'others', 'see']",N/A
805781,AORW1FRF4D4KS,B0001HAISG,azindn,"[0, 1]","Having grown up with Mary Martin's television performances of Peter Pan, I never imagined the character portrayed by anyone other than a middle aged woman. With Jeremy Sumpter's agile and gender correct performance, Peter Pan becomes the screen's most attractive youth who won't grow up. His is a rougish performance filled with adolescent bravado and impish cuteness. An all-round exceptional cast of actors whose credits rarely include children's stories, this film is a delight, and truly a film that is aimed at young as well as older audiences who might accompany them.The subtext of the ambiguous ""hidden kiss"" that lurks in the corner of Wendy's full lips is sensuous and innocent as it should be. It is this element of budding sexuality depicted with tact that has no comparison in the innuendo-heavy bathroom humor typical of young teen oriented comedies that Hollywood produces ad nauseum. Wendy's attraction to Peter's seductive grin is a kind of first blush that is girlish and childish, but also exciting. Wendy's desire to follow Pan to the land of the lost boys where she will tell them stories of Cinderella and be a surrogate mother is playing at maturity but also flirtatious and filled with a curiosity of budding womanhood. It is an element rarely handled in film interpretations of children's genre, however, it was an unmistakable element always just below the surface in period 19th century literature. Films such as Hook and Disney's cartoonish version overlook the complex Victorian social elements that emerge.All the young actors in this film are natural, enormously believable, and attractive. So believable are their adventures in Neverland against Hook and with Princess Tiger Lily and the Indians that we too are swept up joining the experience of fighting with swords and flying. This is heady fantasy and the director never permits the cast to become over the top.  In the lush setting of Neverland, the visual sensation is rich as color is used to convey more than just the physical.Superb performances from versatile veteran actors such as Lynn Redgrave, a biddy aunt are created from the film but feel true to the storyline. However, it is a great character actor Jason Isaac doing double duty portraying the nebbish clerk-father James Darling, and the dastardly, evil, snidely Capt. Hook who fills the screen with vileness and a touch of distilled red-eye poison. Isaac's tragic/comedic villainous character presentation of Hook has the right mix ofbelievable and fearsome elements. It is only in the overlooked, ""An Awfully Big Adventure"" does an actor's performance of Hook by brilliant Alan Rickman have the similar bravado, weight, and believable panache. Isaac should have been acknowledged for his excellent work in the difficult dual role.The film conveys the transitory beauty of childhood on the brink of change with deft handling, scenic drama, and swashbuckling action that is complex as well as bittersweet. As Peter and Wendy dance in the moonlight, their awareness of growing emotional maturity, although seductive, remains an enemy of Peter. His adamant decision never to grow up, to love and experience feelings as an adult is filled with layers of meaning that may be lost on younger audience members. And, when Hook informs Wendy the elements she is attracted to in Peter are the ""riddle of his being,"" he is also hinting at Freudian allusions to the father- daughter complex as well.Wendy can not have feelings for the boy Peter as a lover, nor is she permitted to be attracted to the duo character of the father-enemy, James Darling/Capt. Hook. She is in limbo until imparting on Peter her hidden kiss, a gift that can only be given once in a young girl's life. Wendy's story is one of the inevitable. She must leave Neverland to be the woman, the storyteller, and the mother-wife.  Ultimately, it is only in Neverland that faeries exist and childhood is forever.

The previous incarnations were decent, but nothing spectacular (except Hook) I didn't really like the animated Disney film. I find that when Disney adapts classic stories/fairy tales they tend to over-disneyfy them. And there is generally a lot lost in the translation. I didn't really expect much from this film when I first watched it, I had borrowed a friend's dvd so i'd have something to watch. I actually was quite impressed (so much I purchased this on dvd at one point then on blu ray more recently). I have only recently read the original story (in it's original form) and found that this version is probably the truest or purest telling of the original story. Remember, Hook was more an update on Pan's life, but it also made reference to parts of the original story, which I didn't know at the time, due to the many adaptations of the story that I have read over the years. This movie though is the same story from the book, and the magic of the story is front and center, the actors are well chosen (though for child actors they do a great job at capturing the very essence of the original story) the screenplay serves the movie well and the special effects are top-notch. Though it's really the story that's the star here. This is a definite must have for anyone who like, peter pan, never really grew up...and can appreciate the magic of one of the greatest fairy tales ever created.",5,I really loved this movie...,1366588800,"04 22, 2013",2013,1521,"['saw', 'movie', 'only', 'peter', 'pan', 'related', 'movie', 'actually', 'liked', 'was', 'Hook', 'still', 'classic', 'grandest', 'sense', 'previous', 'incarnations', 'were', 'decent', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'Hook', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'animated', 'Disney', 'film', 'find', 'when', 'Disney', 'classic', 'stories/fairy', 'tales', 'tend', 'over-disneyfy', 'generally', 'lot', 'lost', 'translation', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'much', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'had', 'borrowed', 'friend', 'dvd', 'so', 'i', ""'d"", 'have', 'something', 'watch', 'actually', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'so', 'much', 'purchased', 'dvd', 'one', 'point', 'then', 'blu', 'ray', 'more', 'recently', 'have', 'only', 'recently', 'read', 'original', 'story', 'original', 'form', 'found', 'version', 'probably', 'truest', 'purest', 'telling', 'original', 'story', 'Remember', 'Hook', 'was', 'more', 'update', 'Pan', 'life', 'also', 'made', 'reference', 'parts', 'original', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'time', 'due', 'many', 'adaptations', 'story', 'have', 'read', 'years', 'movie', 'though', 'same', 'story', 'book', 'magic', 'story', 'front', 'center', 'actors', 'are', 'well', 'chosen', 'child', 'actors', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'capturing', 'very', 'essence', 'original', 'story', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'well', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'top-notch', 'really', 'story', 'star', 'here', 'definite', 'must', 'have', 'anyone', 'who', 'peter', 'pan', 'never', 'really', 'grew', 'up', 'can', 'appreciate', 'magic', 'one', 'greatest', 'fairy', 'tales', 'ever', 'created']",N/A
805789,AU78WGAXA3IY1,B0001HAISG,"Chelle ""Chelle""","[2, 5]","Perhaps my expectations were a little skewed when I finally saw this film. At the time of its release, I recall hearing numerous people grumble about the sexuality inherent in the film. Some parents were even asking for a boycott. And all I have to say after seeing it is, um, why?There were only a few instances that I could see someone taking umbrage at, but even then...I would be more disturbed by a young child being able to read into the body language and posturing to see the dormant sexual themes then by the actual treatment of Pan and Wendy's story. As for teenagers, well, some are prone to actually hunting out anything that may be even minutely sexual in order to make a joke, and this movie cannot be blamed for that kind of action. Suffice it to say that there's enough visual stimulation via the dream-like scenery that any older child/teenager seeing it would be distracted enough to perhaps not even notice.That said, I have to admit that I wasn't thrilled by this adaptation of Barrie's story. A friend of mind told me I had to see it because it was a beautiful film. That was true enough. The colors are lush and it looks like a true fantasy world. And as such you know it's not real. There's no reason to comment on whether or not it looks fake or if the special effects aren't believable. A boy can't fly so what difference does it make if in the film he flies too fast or jumps too far? The effects aren't so badly done that it disrupts the movie and thereby ruins the experience of seeing it. But unfortunately, one of the only things I did enjoy was the sense of place they created for the characters. I liked the fact that it was so rich in sensory detail and that the colors were vast and strong. If I remember nothing else about this particular adaptation, I will remember the brilliantly white clouds enshrouded in a salmon hued sky; the pirate ship held captive in frozen waters; and the true green of Pan's forest.As many other reviewers noted, the young man chosen to play Pan was perhaps not the best actor for the role. Pan was arrogant--how else could a young boy laugh in the face of swordplay with a pirate?--but in Jeremy Sumpter's grin that arrogance became unacceptable. Pan's arrogance after all is, in part, born out of his naivety. He's never experienced the adult world so he has no way of knowing that children rarely hold out against adults. But there is just something in that grin of Sumpter's that puts the viewer on edge. It is perhaps too knowing, too aware, for the character. And, really, it was more than just the grin. Other facial expressions followed that seemed somehow off, which ultimately hurt his performance seeing as how most of it relied not on dialogue (which he didn't carry off well, either) but on physical reactions to all kinds of situations. In short, he was completely unconvincing.Rachel Hurd-Wood was just lovely as Wendy. She was luminously innocent and yet she pulled off the awakening awareness of her character with wonder and grace. Great things should be expected from this beautiful young lady in future acting endeavors.It was Jason Isaacs performance, however, that I enjoyed the most. His portrayal of Mr. Darling was adorable--A devoted, if somewhat exasperated, father who found it most difficult to make small talk. While as Hook he was suitably menacing, but in a more understated fashion than some may have wished, and charming still. Choosing not to read anything into the fact that he played both roles, I think they found a very suitable actor for the part(s).There is so much behind the story of Peter Pan and the Lost Boys. J.M. Barrie's life experiences played such a great role in the creation of it that it's almost a shame that it doesn't shine through more in a live action version of the story. As an adult, I think you appreciate Pan and the boys more for knowing about Barrie's life. But in so doing, it takes some of the shine off of P.J. Hogan's vision. I am not entirely sure why, but I felt it acutely while watching the movie.

Barrie's classic play (released in the latter's hundred-year anniversary year!), except in the Disney version (where Bobby Driscoll voiced him), has Peter Pan been played by a genuine boy.  And watching it, you can't help wondering why, because young Jason Sumpter makes such a perfect Peter--handsome, lively, smirkingly real.  He comes to linger outside the nursery window of the Darling home in Edwardian London to listen to the stories told by daughter Wendy (Rachel Hurd-Wood) to her brothers John and Michael (Harry Newell, Freddie Popplewell)--traditional fairy tales spiced up with pirates and other adventurous elements--and loses his shadow when lunged at by the Darlings' dog-nursemaid Nana.  When he returns to retrieve it, he and Wendy meet face-to-face, and before they know it the young Darlings are flying off to Neverland.  The script follows the play closely, even unto retaining the stage tradition of having Captain Hook and Mr. Darling played by the same actor (Jason Isaacs in this case), but with a few improvements--John and Michael captured, along with Tiger Lily (Carsen Gray), by the pirates and left to drown as the tide comes in; Wendy carried off alone by Hook and tempted to join the crew of the ""Jolly Roger,"" then returned; an exchange between Hook and Peter during their climactic duel in which Hook points out how much alike they really are, because Peter, unable to grow up, can't love or be loved; and a splendid little bit in which Tiger Lily responds to Hook's blandishments with a lengthy diatribe in her native language, very clearly telling him exactly what she thinks of him, although the faithful and discreet Mr. Smee (Richard Briers, who fits the part to perfection) chooses not to translate literally.  Neverland is a vividly colored and ""nicely crammed"" place that reminds you of some of the great illustrators of children's books then at work, and the special effects (by George Lucas's ILM) are wonderful--as are Hurd-Wood and her young male counterparts slinging swords against Hook's pirates with the aplomb of miniature Errol Flynns.  (Parents of sensitive children should be warned of scary bits, including Hook's crocodile (which is a giant, probably prehistoric, one) and a brief scene showing his truncated arm.)  You can't resist asking yourself why someone didn't try doing this back in the '30's heyday of child stars, and what Mickey Rooney or Freddie Bartholomew might have made of Sumpter's part--although, of course, they wouldn't have had Lucas's wizardry to back them up.

I've never been a fan of the animated version but I absolutely loved this recreation of the classic story about the adventures of Peter Pan, a boy who refuses to grow up, the intriguing storyteller and mother to the lost boys, Wendy, his pirate nemesis, Captain Hook, who seeks revenge from losing his right hand, which was fed to a crocodile that has since then continued to follow him with a ticking clock inside, wanting to taste more, and of course the magic that is Neverland. However, this new edition doesn't just focus on the greatness of staying young forever (or until you die) but it also shows the sadness of it too, giving this film more substance and meaning. It's definitely geared toward adult audiences who take pleasure in enchanting fantasies, like me, but it's certainly suitable and fun for the whole family.Although this is based on the popular animation they are similar in plot yet details are slightly altered, giving this several interesting twists so that your uncertain as to what is going to happen next. The beginning even takes place before Nana (the dog nurse) captured Peter Pan's shadow, which I found to be very clever as I always wondered how that happened... Tinkerbell was dazzling as the jealous faery, the sets, or rather special effects were all magnificent, and the entire cast was superbly chosen.

Wendy and all the cast are equally perfect in their roles. As an aside, I would point out that although Savanarola might have thought some characters scantilly dressed, there is NO nudity, child or otherwise, and this film is safe fore anyone's children, whether they be of Puritan stock or Unitarian agnostics. Like any library where books like Peter Pan might reside on the bookshelf, this DVD can be returned to periodically.

805796,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0001HAISG,"Cloud ""...""","[4, 6]","The animated Disney version of Peter Pan was well-liked but I didn't care for the native scenes(by the way, don't you dare say squaw to a native woman, you won't believe how offensive it is). The Spielberg re-telling was a bit too heavy handed with skateboarding, basketball, baseball and a character joining the bad guys subplot that did not work in the film. It was also a bit boring and long. The Hogan re-telling recalls a lot of the Disney version and adding in it's own stuff.Wendy(Rachel Hurd-Wood in a great debut) is about to grow up and become a lady but wishes not to.  One night, Peter Pan comes looking for his shadow hiding in a drawer. Wendy wakes up to find him and sews it back on. He then teaches her and her 3 brothers to fly and they travel to Neverland where Peter's archnemesis Captain Hook is on a mission to rid Neverland of Peter forever.There is some changes from the Disney version that's different. The mermaids in Blue Lagoon are actually treacherous and bit threatening to look at instead of the serene Spielberg versions or the nice-but-too-playful Disney ones. Instead of Hook's, well hook attached to his hand very easily, it now is a contraption he must hook up to himself. Hook never knew how to fly and when Pan rescues Tiger Lily, it's in a dungeon/castle like setting rather than a cave.There is good things. For one it looks spectacular with great effects and shots that seem out of a painting. Jason Isaacs, who was best known for playing villains(Patriot, Harry Potter) gets to play a dual role with Mr. Darling and Hook himself. The debut of Hurd-Wood and not to mention Olivia Williams is still great to look at. All in all, it's a great version of the well-known story that sadly didn't get that much attention when released(it was made for 125 million with advertising and production budget but made 120 worldwide).

My wife and I were surrounded by little children, each of which were more excited about this movie than I had seen for Lord of the Rings, or Star Wars, or any major epic in recent years. See this movie was meant for them. We all know and love the story of Peter Pan, and a good many of us also fell in love with the unofficial sequel Hook (albeit only after it hit home video and DVD as its theatrical presentation didn't fare to well.) But it was only after seeing this movie sitting next to a young girl, about 6 or 7 at the most and seeing how she responded to this film did I begin to understand what Peter Pan is. Its a story about the tragedy of loosing our innocence, about being forced to grow up, and take on adult responsibilities when we all would much rather just play and have fun. Most of all its about wanting the best of both worlds, the things that come with adulthood such as love, and family, without having to sacrifice the comforts of childhood. That is the inner struggle of Peter Pan. He wants to love, but knows that he cannot, because if he gives into his heart it means he would have to grow up. It's amazing to see a movie that so beautifully captures the emotional struggle that children go through at that age. The inner struggle to cling to the things that are fun, and innocent, and childish, versus the desire to become independent, to love and be loved beyond a mother-son-brother-father type of setting, and yet the need to be cared for and taken care of. I was blown away by this movie because quite simply... I have never read the book, and I had no idea Peter Pan was this deep. The most moving part was when the girl I was sitting next to cried into her mother's chest proclaiming that she didn't want to grow up. There is the heart of Peter Pan, realizing that inevitably we all grow up, we'll all have bills, we'll all have unsatisfactory jobs (with a few exceptions), we'll all grow old, and most important we'll all die. Peter Pan is a symbol defying this cycle that binds and imprisons all adults. I suddenly find myself wishing I hadn't grown up either. That's not to say that I don't enjoy the benefits of being an adult, but this movie did make me yearn again for my younger days. Without a doubt, this movie is a must see for everyone. Child and adult alike this film will reach you in ways that no other presentation of this story has ever accomplished.",5,"Deep, meaningful, powerful.",1077580800,"02 24, 2004",2004,2461,"['Seeing', 'movie', 'theater', 'was', 'something', 'marvel', 'wife', 'were', 'surrounded', 'little', 'children', 'were', 'more', 'excited', 'movie', 'had', 'seen', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Star', 'Wars', 'major', 'epic', 'recent', 'years', 'See', 'movie', 'was', 'meant', 'know', 'love', 'story', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'good', 'many', 'also', 'fell', 'love', 'unofficial', 'sequel', 'Hook', 'only', 'hit', 'home', 'video', 'DVD', 'theatrical', 'presentation', 'did', ""n't"", 'fare', 'well', 'was', 'only', 'seeing', 'movie', 'sitting', 'next', 'young', 'girl', 'about', '6', '7', 'most', 'seeing', 'how', 'responded', 'film', 'did', 'begin', 'understand', 'what', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'story', 'tragedy', 'loosing', 'innocence', 'being', 'forced', 'grow', 'up', 'take', 'adult', 'responsibilities', 'when', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'just', 'play', 'have', 'fun', 'Most', 'wanting', 'best', 'worlds', 'things', 'come', 'adulthood', 'such', 'love', 'family', 'having', 'sacrifice', 'comforts', 'childhood', 'inner', 'struggle', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'love', 'can', 'not', 'heart', 'would', 'have', 'grow', 'up', 'amazing', 'see', 'movie', 'so', 'beautifully', 'emotional', 'struggle', 'children', 'go', 'age', 'inner', 'struggle', 'cling', 'things', 'are', 'fun', 'innocent', 'childish', 'desire', 'become', 'independent', 'love', 'be', 'loved', 'mother-son-brother-father', 'type', 'setting', 'yet', 'need', 'be', 'cared', 'taken', 'care', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'movie', 'quite', 'simply', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'had', 'idea', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'was', 'deep', 'most', 'moving', 'part', 'was', 'when', 'girl', 'was', 'sitting', 'next', 'cried', 'mother', 'chest', 'proclaiming', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'grow', 'up', 'heart', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'realizing', 'inevitably', 'grow', 'up', ""'ll"", 'have', 'bills', ""'ll"", 'have', 'unsatisfactory', 'jobs', 'few', 'exceptions', ""'ll"", 'grow', 'old', 'most', 'important', ""'ll"", 'die', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'symbol', 'defying', 'cycle', 'binds', 'imprisons', 'adults', 'suddenly', 'find', 'wishing', 'had', ""n't"", 'grown', 'up', 'not', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'benefits', 'being', 'adult', 'movie', 'did', 'make', 'yearn', 'again', 'younger', 'days', 'doubt', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'everyone', 'Child', 'adult', 'alike', 'film', 'will', 'reach', 'ways', 'other', 'presentation', 'story', 'ever', 'accomplished']",N/A
805801,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B0001HAISG,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[0, 1]","Simply put...this version of PETER PAN is the movie that Steven Spielberg should have made instead of the misguided effort with Robin Williams a decade earlier. Here is the live action version of the classic Disney animated feature that we have long waited for. With some incredible acting, beautiful cinematography and fantastic sets this is a splash of fantasy that truly entertains and is a wonder to behold.Yes, the movie does hold truer to the 1953 Disney production than the Barrie book, but it works so well here that one does not mind.The two young leads in Jeremy Sumpter (as Peter) and Rachel Hurd-Wood (as Wendy) are remarkable finds. Sumpter portrays Peter's childlike wonder and sense of fun convincingly, while Wood really goes through possibly the biggest of character arcs, ready to grow up as the movie draws to a close.Everybody is already well familiar with the story. Wendy and her two brothers are whisked away to NeverLand (not to be confused with the Jackson ranch) on a great adventure where they meet up with the Lost Boys (orphans, not the vampires of the well known popular movie), pirates, evil mermaids, crocodiles and the villainous Capt. Hook.Whereas NeverLand is a place where nobody grows up the movie itself is all about growing up. Every character goes through some story arc from Peter and Wendy, all the way to Mr. Darling (who realizes how much he really misses his children and throws financial considerations and social standing out the window) to Aunt Millicent (played wonderfully zany by Lynn Redgrave) who really embraces the idea of motherhood by the end of the movie.With top billing Jason Isaacs portrays the double role of Mr. Darling and Capt. Hook and he really puts his all into every scene with a reserved conservative air to Darling to an exuberant over-the-top appropriate overacting for the flamboyant Hook.My favorite scenes are probably those between Sumpter and Wood. With a slightly gawky cuteness to her, its easy to see why Peter becomes so taken by Wood's Wendy and their relationship develops in some of the best scripted child character scenes I have yet witnessed.Of course, as is the case with so many big-budget movies these days, one of the big stars of the movie is the computer special effects. One scene I found particularly impressive was the shot of the pirate ship traversing the landmarks of London at the end with the fog taking on the appearance and characteristics of the ocean, but really the whole movie is a wonder to behold.Fans of British television will recognize well-known character actors such as Geoffrey Palmer as Darlings boss (Sir Edward Quiller Couch) and Richard Briers (as Smee). Also those with sharp ears will recognize the narrators voice as that of international star Saffron Burrows.I could go on and on about how much I enjoyed this movie and how rewarding and satisfying it was, but really the proof is there for the individual viewer. This is a movie that is safe and enjoyable for the whole family and as such is, in my opinion, one of the best live-action family films to come out of Hollywood since the golden age of Walt Disney in the 1950s and 1960s.",5,Lose yourself in this fun fantasy adventure,1122595200,"07 29, 2005",2005,3157,"['Simply', 'put', 'version', 'PETER', 'PAN', 'movie', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'instead', 'misguided', 'effort', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'decade', 'earlier', 'Here', 'live', 'action', 'version', 'classic', 'Disney', 'animated', 'feature', 'have', 'long', 'waited', 'incredible', 'acting', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'fantastic', 'sets', 'splash', 'fantasy', 'truly', 'entertains', 'wonder', 'behold.Yes', 'movie', 'hold', 'truer', '1953', 'Disney', 'production', 'Barrie', 'book', 'so', 'well', 'here', 'one', 'not', 'mind.The', 'two', 'young', 'leads', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', 'Peter', 'Rachel', 'Hurd-Wood', 'Wendy', 'are', 'remarkable', 'finds', 'Sumpter', 'Peter', 'childlike', 'wonder', 'sense', 'fun', 'convincingly', 'Wood', 'really', 'possibly', 'biggest', 'character', 'arcs', 'ready', 'grow', 'up', 'movie', 'close.Everybody', 'already', 'well', 'familiar', 'story', 'Wendy', 'two', 'brothers', 'are', 'whisked', 'away', 'NeverLand', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'Jackson', 'ranch', 'great', 'adventure', 'where', 'meet', 'up', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'orphans', 'not', 'vampires', 'well', 'known', 'popular', 'movie', 'evil', 'mermaids', 'crocodiles', 'villainous', 'Capt', 'Hook.Whereas', 'NeverLand', 'place', 'where', 'nobody', 'up', 'movie', 'growing', 'up', 'character', 'story', 'arc', 'Peter', 'Wendy', 'way', 'Mr', 'Darling', 'who', 'how', 'much', 'really', 'children', 'financial', 'considerations', 'social', 'standing', 'out', 'window', 'Aunt', 'Millicent', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'zany', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'who', 'really', 'idea', 'motherhood', 'end', 'movie.With', 'top', 'billing', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'double', 'role', 'Mr', 'Darling', 'Capt', 'Hook', 'really', 'scene', 'reserved', 'conservative', 'air', 'Darling', 'exuberant', 'over-the-top', 'appropriate', 'overacting', 'flamboyant', 'Hook.My', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'are', 'probably', 'Sumpter', 'Wood', 'slightly', 'gawky', 'cuteness', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Peter', 'so', 'taken', 'Wood', 'Wendy', 'relationship', 'best', 'scripted', 'child', 'character', 'scenes', 'have', 'yet', 'witnessed.Of', 'course', 'case', 'so', 'many', 'big-budget', 'movies', 'days', 'one', 'big', 'stars', 'movie', 'computer', 'special', 'effects', 'One', 'scene', 'found', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'was', 'shot', 'pirate', 'ship', 'traversing', 'landmarks', 'London', 'end', 'fog', 'taking', 'appearance', 'characteristics', 'ocean', 'really', 'whole', 'movie', 'wonder', 'behold.Fans', 'British', 'television', 'will', 'recognize', 'well-known', 'character', 'actors', 'such', 'Geoffrey', 'Palmer', 'Darlings', 'boss', 'Sir', 'Edward', 'Quiller', 'Couch', 'Richard', 'Briers', 'Smee', 'Also', 'sharp', 'ears', 'will', 'recognize', 'narrators', 'voice', 'international', 'star', 'Saffron', 'Burrows.I', 'could', 'go', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'how', 'rewarding', 'satisfying', 'was', 'really', 'proof', 'there', 'individual', 'viewer', 'movie', 'safe', 'enjoyable', 'whole', 'family', 'such', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'live-action', 'family', 'films', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'golden', 'age', 'Walt', 'Disney', '1950s', '1960s']",N/A

805803,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B0001HAISG,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[10, 12]","There is a Bible passage that goes like this:""If I Speak with the tongues of men and angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging symbol.  And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries, and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.  And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I deliver my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.""  (I Cor. 13:1-3 NASV)After watching P.J. Hogan's (My Best Friends Wedding) brand new retelling of J.M. Barrie's classic novel, I think we can see this old passage come to life.If you've spent the last century living under a rock then you'll have never learned of the little boy who never grew up.  You'll have never seen Walt Disney's chaste adventure, Steven Speilberg's reimagining, or Mary Martin's stupid musical.  You've never been enchanted by thinking good thoughts or laughed yourself silly by not believing in fairies (Oh darn, I just killed another one).  If you have been deprived by never having read or even seen this enchanting story unfold, then I suggest you rush out to your local library and read the book.For those of us who know the story, I will tell you that this is the most faithful adaptations of the book and also the most interesting.  For the first time in cinematic history Peter is not seen as a hero, but as what he truly is; a sad lonely boy who's trapped in a fantasy world of his own design.  A boy who has the whole world at his fingertips and yet has the one thing he can never have: love.I was blown away by how this film is so bold.  Every other PETER PAN film or story usually features a woman or a grown man in the part.  But for once this film shows us the Peter that truly exists.I remember seeing J.M. Barrie's stage play by the Royal Shakespeare in 2000.  I remember how the press made a big deal about the play because it was the first time a male would play him on stage and when I got there I saw an effeminate male prancing around.  What was missing was the light of a child's eyes and that's what this PETER PAN has.  The illusion of a boy who never grows up is lost if he's played by someone who has already grown up.Jeremey Sumpter (Fraility) plays Peter with exuberance and the hint of sadness that is always under the surface.  While we cannot be children forever, don't we all long for that?  But what if you could be a child forever, as the world grows up around you?  Your fantasy world may start to lose its luster.I also loved how Neverland was full of danger.  I remember going through my old writings and finding a book I tried to write when I was four or five.  In it was a mother dying and lots of violence. Innocent and cute on the outside, but all my inward fantasies were full of violence.  This Neverland is full of peril, from the Mermaids who want to drown you, to the large Croc who swallowed a clock.  Neverland may be a fun place, but it's definitely not a safe place.  Much like the playgrounds of old.The other more important story points that this new film really handled well was the innocent sexual tension created by two children.  Peter and Wendy are still at the point where girls and boys are icky, but yet are brought together by fantasy and fun.  What was your first crush like?  Kind of awkward and a little funny.I loved to watch the fantasy of the two of them dancing in the moonlight.  Their attempt to play the role of mother and father when they have no idea how, and their longing to be together.  Since they are young, they do not have the facilities to understand this feeling.Rachael Hurd-Wood portrays Wendy with a gentile innocence.  This is her first film, but she's so good other roles cannot be far off.  She reminds me of a young Nicole Kidman.  Her character is nicely rounded and full of the childlike wonder you normally see in the role.I would also be remiss if I didn't mention PETER PAN'S nemesis Captain Hook.  Jason Issac's (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets) Hook is faithful but a tad too dark for it's own good.  It's also a little creepy to watch this grown man's obsession with a little boy.

805804,A2CNQ1JV16GHW2,B0001HAISG,David Cady,"[4, 5]","Although perhaps it's unfair to label this film as simply ""family"" entertainment.  P.J. Hogan's witty, magical version of J.M. Barrie's classic is a superb, mesmerizing piece of fantasy filmmaking that both parents and children will find infinitely rewarding.  Hogan and co-screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have taken some liberties with Barrie, but, incredibly, they enhance the original in ways that resonate in moving and heartbreaking ways.  (Goldenberg is the screenwriter for the upcoming ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" which is very good news for fans of that franchise.)  The casting is uniformly perfect, starting with Jeremy Sumpter's Peter, whose expressive grin and eyebrows bring the character to vibrant, mischieveous life.  How right that he's the only American in the cast, emphasizing Peter's exotic other-ness.  Rachel Hurd-Wood couldn't be lovelier as Wendy, and Jason Issacs is nothing short of brilliant, showing his full range as an actor, in the twin roles of Mr. Darling & Captain Hook.  And I love how Hogan and his art director, Roger Ford, have chosen to make their universe look unabashadly fantastical (as opposed to a Peter Jackson, who strives to make the fantastical look 100% real).  If I have one bone to pick, I would say that Ludivine Sagnier's Tinkerbell is a little too comically cutesy for my taste, but it's a minor quibble.

805808,A2IE7YPWUYZAXS,B0001HAISG,David Wilson,"[3, 4]","I must admit that until I read the book and watched this movie I really never did understand Peter Pan.  The stage version with Cathy Rigby was truly confusing and ridicules.  But, two weeks ago I did read the book and then yesterday went to see the movie.  The movie was fantastic.  It did follow the book extremely well with three exceptions.  One, it omitted some minor bits of the book (like the neverbird) that would have probably slowed down the movie and not added much.Two, the epilog was not shown but I think the same point was made at the end where Peter is looking in at the reunited Darlings and the narrator says that it (growing up in a family) is one joy that Peter will never have.Three, way too much was made about Peter being too young to understand love.  This did not come from the book but, rather, the script writers.  Some other reviewers below have tried to psychoanalyze why some men seem afraid of commitment in relationships by saying that they are like Peter Pan and just won't grow up.  That is purely simplistic.  In most instances men that won't commit are actually very much in tune with what love is; more than the women trying to make them commit.  Unfortunately, they have been hurt in the past by women that really don't know that love is more than a word for a relationship.  After learning that they can be hurt for falling in love they then proceed with much more caution.  A fear of commitment?  No.  A fear of being emotionally hurt.The special effects in the movie were great and almost surreal.  Tink was a little over done but all of the rest of the cast played their parts perfectly.  Like the book, the movie was pretty much a story of Wendy growing up.  Peter Pan and Neverland was really just a vehicle used by the author to show the loss of innocence in the transition from childhood to adulthood.  Peter Pan made the perfect contrast to Wendy.  The child that would never grow up with the child that realized she had to grow up.  Definitely a five star movie.

And perhaps because it was made in Australia with British cast and director aren't very well known it didn't sit well with American audiences.  There are no sing-song sequences. Some scenes may be a little intense for the very little ones,like swordfights and the crocodile, there is a little romance between Peter and Wendy as well, but is very cute and completely innocent. The story is very well brought to life and you'll never find a dull moment.The DVD has lots of bonus materials with in depth look at behind the scenes and other features. My only complaint is that you cannot skip or foward the previews in order to get to the main movie.I give it 5 stars, worthy of having in your collection of family films adapted from books.",5,A more truthful version of the classic book,1297641600,"02 14, 2011",2011,1281,"['great', 'movie', 'aspect', 'great', 'directing', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'good', 'script', 'music', 'amazing', 'sets', 'costumes', 'flying', 'sequences', 'put', 'Superman', 'films', 'shame', 'probably', 'one', 'not', 'best', 'adaptation', 'J.', 'M.', 'Barrie', 'classic', 'children', 'story', 'think', 'director', 'producers', 'tried', 'put', 'much', 'book', 'possible', 'very', 'long', 'almost', '2', 'hours', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'did', 'Lord', 'Rings.This', 'wonderful', 'family', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'Disney', 'animated', 'version', 'tale', 'perhaps', 'was', 'made', 'Australia', 'British', 'cast', 'director', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'known', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'American', 'audiences', 'are', 'sing-song', 'sequences', 'scenes', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'intense', 'very', 'little', 'ones', 'swordfights', 'crocodile', 'little', 'romance', 'Peter', 'Wendy', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'cute', 'completely', 'innocent', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'brought', 'life', ""'ll"", 'never', 'find', 'dull', 'moment.The', 'DVD', 'lots', 'bonus', 'materials', 'depth', 'look', 'scenes', 'other', 'features', 'only', 'complaint', 'can', 'not', 'skip', 'foward', 'previews', 'order', 'get', 'main', 'movie.I', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'worthy', 'having', 'collection', 'family', 'films', 'adapted', 'books']",N/A
805816,A73AVAAV1PVGP,B0001HAISG,"Erin Smith ""EzZa""","[3, 4]","I absolutely loved this movie! At the age of 15, I had forgotten the story of peter pan, but when this movie came out I was flooded with fond memories of the animated movie and decided to watch it. I automatically set myself up for disappointment and to be bored, but to my amazement-this movie was fantastic. Jeremy was great as peter pan-a  lot of people didn't like him because they thought he was ""over-acting"" but they COULDN'T have read the book, because that's the way peter pan is; a bit self absorbed very energetic and maybe a bit of a brat-but loveable all the same. Wendy was played well, so we're the lost boys, (I loved slightly!) And her two brothers (john was a laugh) Tinker bell was good, allough a lot of people didn't like the way she over acted-since she couldn't talk there wasn't any other way for her to get the message across (did you think about that before you commented?!) Jason Isaac's plays both father and caption hook-surprisingly I didn't even notice, and I doubt any one else will. His acting is so totally different and good in these two roles that it wouldn't matter if you recognised him as the same person anyway. Allough this movie stays pretty much true to the book, there are some scenes that are taken-added or the words are slightly changed, however, it all fits together perfectly-there are no flaws. This is a great movie for the whole family-heck I'm 15 and I LOVE it! (I don't ever want to grow up!) The dvd is good, with lots of extra features, which are very interesting and funny. There is a lot of great stuff in this movie-action, love comedy, it's great. The one thing I didn't like at FIRST was the ending in the book that they left out, but when I watched it in the special features I realised this was a change for the better-if they left it in the movie would of ended on a sad note-and we don't want that!WATCH IT!And as peter would say ""oh the cleverness of me!""",5,"""You can't catch me and make me a man!""",1102032000,"12 3, 2004",2004,1921,"['absolutely', 'loved', 'movie', 'age', '15', 'had', 'forgotten', 'story', 'peter', 'pan', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'flooded', 'fond', 'memories', 'animated', 'movie', 'decided', 'watch', 'automatically', 'set', 'up', 'disappointment', 'be', 'bored', 'amazement-this', 'movie', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Jeremy', 'was', 'great', 'peter', 'pan-a', 'lot', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'thought', 'was', 'over-acting', 'COULD', ""N'T"", 'have', 'read', 'book', 'way', 'peter', 'pan', 'bit', 'self', 'absorbed', 'very', 'energetic', 'maybe', 'bit', 'brat-but', 'loveable', 'same', 'Wendy', 'was', 'played', 'well', ""'re"", 'lost', 'boys', 'loved', 'slightly', 'two', 'brothers', 'john', 'was', 'laugh', 'Tinker', 'bell', 'was', 'good', 'lot', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'way', 'acted-since', 'could', ""n't"", 'talk', 'was', ""n't"", 'other', 'way', 'get', 'message', 'did', 'think', 'commented', 'Jason', 'Isaac', 'plays', 'father', 'caption', 'hook-surprisingly', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'doubt', 'one', 'else', 'will', 'acting', 'so', 'totally', 'different', 'good', 'two', 'roles', 'would', ""n't"", 'matter', 'recognised', 'same', 'person', 'anyway', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'true', 'book', 'are', 'scenes', 'are', 'taken-added', 'words', 'are', 'slightly', 'changed', 'however', 'together', 'perfectly-there', 'are', 'flaws', 'great', 'movie', 'whole', 'family-heck', ""'m"", '15', 'LOVE', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'want', 'grow', 'up', 'dvd', 'good', 'lots', 'extra', 'features', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'funny', 'lot', 'great', 'stuff', 'movie-action', 'love', 'comedy', 'great', 'one', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'FIRST', 'was', 'ending', 'book', 'left', 'out', 'when', 'watched', 'special', 'features', 'realised', 'was', 'change', 'better-if', 'left', 'movie', 'would', 'ended', 'sad', 'note-and', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'WATCH', 'IT', 'peter', 'would', 'say', 'cleverness']",N/A

Though I find no fault with the Peter Pan story in general, this movie is a big disapointment for several reasons. Firstly, the parts of Wendy and Peter I can only say are annoying, and rendered a little disturbing by the semi-repellent, underlying Pre-teen romance that intrudes itself unceremoniously throughout. Tinkerbell is nothing short of irritating likewise. And Captian Hook is dull. I must admit that though there are some funny scenes and lines, the overall effect of the movie was uninteresting and tedious.One of my friends spoke highly of this movie, and trusting her taste I did go into the theater with an open mind, however it proved to be just disapointing.

805820,A39C2BQXZHOUMJ,B0001HAISG,G. Dowling,"[15, 16]","PJ Hogan's ""Peter Pan"" is my favorite rendition of JM Barrie's beloved classic about the charming and wild boy who never grows up.  More than any other version preceding it, Hogan puts the struggles of adolescence and the ruminations on childhood front and center in this tory, whereas previous versions merely brushed against these issues in a superficial way.  Hogan even allows the attraction between Peter and Wendy to feel a bit more..., well...""heated"" as opposed to more platonic.  That is not to say this version is crude or inappropriate, but Hogan allows these elements to flow more freely and with dramatic logic.  Hogan's version is faithful, but he has made changes here, and I dare say, much needed ones which update this story is the best possible sense, most notably, the ending...instead of Peter returning to Wendy years later and finding out she's an adult and he then starts anew with adventures with her daughter.  It instead ends on a much more logical note which is when the lost boys are ""adopted"" by Wendy's family and Peter still makes the decision, and a devastating one, to remain a boy and he flies away.  Instead of this moment feelinglike a triumph, it feels like an escape born out of fear.  Which is exactly what it is.""Peter Pan"", more than most others, is one of the titles I have been anticipating with baited breath on Blu-ray.  The film is so visually dazzling and the special effects, sets, costumes, and art direction are so beautiful, it screams hi-def ""eye candy.""  I was not disappointed.  From the first shot, a surrealized VFX shot illustrating the snowy rooftops of London, I kept saying ""Wow"", under my breath.  Universal's VC-1 encode is beautiful, framing the picture at 2.40 in 1080p.  There is a light veneer of film grain which gives the film a warm, filmic texture.  There is some mild use of DNR, however, this can be traced back to the source and you will notice it only in certain VFX shots, so this is director intention.  I did not notice any glaring edge enhancement, and ringing, aliasing, noise, debris, etc. never rear their heads.  This transfer exceeded my expectations on Blu-ray and fans should be equally pleased.More of a surprise, is the DTS-HD MA 5.1 soundtrack, which is fabulous...creating an immersive experience that the SD DVDs serviceable, but underwhelming, lossy DD 5.1 simply did not provide.  Sound effects are awesome, with lots of rear channel activity complete with great directionality and pans (I had to!), and the whooshes and thumps of the LFE which comprise the action scenes are exciting and reveal much more imaging than I expected.  There was a lot of sound information I heard for the first time such as some of the lost boys' wisecracks as they talk over each other, those lines are now present in the ambient surrounds and cross-channel pans. James Newton-Howard's brilliant, magical score comes heart-poundingly to life in all its lossless glory.  Dialogue is crisp and well-prioritized with evey syllable being crystal clear.  Look at the scene where the entire cast performs the famous ""I Do Believe in fairies"" scene which needs to balance score, dialogue, sound effects from thunder and lightning, etc....there are a number of complex elements, and it was a muddy mess in SD Dolby, but it now is a tour de force with every element being imaged brilliantly in this lossless encode.  It i he only way all this information can be handled.  It isnow the exhilarating scene I knew it was.This is a must-have for fans of the film, and certainly hi-def junkies.  It is a reference grade disc in my opinion, and it is a no-brainer for an upgrade if you already own it on SD DVD.

805821,A21XVS00AIENLX,B0001HAISG,"G. Jennings ""G. J.""","[5, 7]","I'm a huge fan of fantasy films, and this one is just right. When I saw the trailer, I thought yet again another remake of Peter Pan with super special effects and screaming kids off to Neverland.  But as they say, never judge a movie by its trailer.  I was pleasantly surprised with this film!Peter Pan for the first time is played by a child actor of suitable age, Jeremy Sumpter. He pulls off the portrayal excellently.  Every smirk, movement of the eyebrow, and teasing laugh captures all the mischievous and adventurous charm that is Peter Pan.  You cannot blame Wendy for falling for him.  He fulfills just about everything that is in her heart's desire.  However, Peter Pan is not just a crafty sprite who plays games and laughs all day.  We discover throughout the movie that he's a lot more three dimensional.  He does have feelings, he's flawed, he cries and when he fights, he actually gets beat around a good few times. He does not always think happy thoughts when it comes to bad news about Wendy.That's what is very special about this film.  It slows down enough to explore the feelings Peter Pan and Wendy have for one another since both of them are on the brink of puberty.  This is captured in a tender and sweet Dance of the Fairies.  I have never seen such an enchanting moment pictured on film.  It's a scene so memorably delicate, it often brings tears to my eyes.  It makes you want to go awwwwwwww!  It was at this point in the movie I realized the film was going to be more than just a game of Pirates versus Peter Pan and the kids.There's another one of those endearing moments between Wendy and Peter Pan later in the film, but why spoil the fun of it?  Might it involve a thimble?I'm a big fan of Jason Isaacs so his version of Capt Hook is by far the best, putting past Hooks to shame.  The man is entirely dashing with amazing outfits (not just red).  This Capt Hook has taste, culture and cunning.  Isaacs is brilliant at striking the right balance of humour and malice in Hook without making him a caricature. He's somewhat chivalrous and still manages to shows respect for his enemy. And he worries. He is constantly reminded of his mortality by the ticking clock in the belly of that menacing crocodile.  What a loss to die old, alone and done for.  He hates the endless youthful carefree nature of Peter Pan; when he discovers Pan and Wendy's budding relationship, Hook is both fascinated and depressed.Smee is a delightful comic relief but never a stooge. The banter between him and Hook is humorous yet balanced enough to show that Hook is still in charge and not a man to be crossed.  In Spielberg's &quot;Hook&quot; too much time was spent on the comic episodes between Smee and Hook that you sometimes wondered if they were staying focused on the task of finding Peter Pan.The Darling children were absolutely darling without being over the top.  Just as Peter Pan is played first time by a boy, we get to see the first girl Wendy.  Rachel and Jeremy have great on-screen chemistry which adds to the magic of the film.  And the Lost Boys were sepctaular.  They were far more realistic than those obnoxiously annoying brats in Spielberg's version.  No cheesy lines like Rufiioooo or Bangerang, thank goodness.  However, one of my favorite lines in this flim is when Hook rolls his eyes at Wendy wanting to give Pan a gift and bawks, &quot;How like a girl!&quot;Best of all is Tinkerbell.  Ludivine Sagnier is perfectly cast. She is such an expressive actress, giving Tinkerbell an adoringly playful and mischievous charm suitable for a fairy jealous of Wendy's affections for Pan.  She's much closer to the Disney version of Tinkerbell except slightly less graceful. Julia Roberts made for a boring chatty lovelorn Tinkerbell, waiting for that moment when Peter Pan will show up at her doorstep to give him a real kiss or hoping he'll call. A pretty boring and desparate version of Tinkerbell really.This is a great film that'll be loved by all ages with memorable scenes full of adventure and enchantment enchanced by a brilliant score.

A mean ol' pirate with a grudge the size of Neverland Island. One hungry croc. So while the story is not new, this new verison of it is a sumptious visual feast, wonderful for both adults and children alike.Based on the classic children's tale &quot;Peter Pan&quot; by J. M. Barrie, this movie attempts to be a somewhat faithful adaptation to the original story. P.J. Hogan's retelling allows for some dramatic departures to help propel the story along, but generally stays to the well-loved pattern.  What he takes in creative licenses, he returns fourfold in absolute charm and beauty.This Peter Pan is lucsious. With generous use of special effects, and stunning visual displays, Neverland has come alive as never before. It is storybook real, with scenery so thick it looks like you could cut it with a knife and find it full of frosting. A review aptly compared the visual style to that of a Maxwell Parrish painting, rightfully so. This is a dreamy film.Also, some different touches I appreciated. First, Pan himself finallly played by a boy. While I LOVED Mary Martin's Pan (she, along with Disney's, was my first), this character begs to be played by a boy, and Jeremy Sumpter revels in his role. He brings a childish sensuality to the role, as he interacts innocently with Rachel Hurd-Wood's Wendy. Jason Isaacs follows Pan tradition and plays both Mr. Darling and Hook with appropriate meance and glee. Plus, there is a natural attraction to the very Englishness of the story. Much of my early childhood was formed between the pages of Pan and Poppins, so the righteous properness of this story comforts and charms.There is a real need for good movies that both children and adults can watch, and this is one of them.

Now, the special effects are not your typical effects you'll see these days in movies.

(I liked him a lot better than Dustin Hoffman) Mr. Smee is hilarious but, he's not quite as good as Bob Hoskins.Rachel Hurd-Wood plays Wendy and does a fantastic job.

No matter who you are or how old you are, you can fall in love all over again about the boy who refused to grow up.  The storytelling gets deeper as we learn more about Wendy and that there is so much more to life than being a boy and having fun.  The J.M. Barrie novel of Peter Pan that you that you knew, is not what it appears to be.  It's not just about wanting to grow up, it's about friendship and adventure.  Peter Pan may live in a fantasy world past the stars and straight on till morning, but he is still young and always will reamin young at heart.  The visual effects are astonishing and better than ever can be imagined.  And so is James Newton Howard's score is heart-felt.  It makes you want to believe in Peter Pan.

This original book was actually titled PETER ANDWENDY, the original name.  It is falling apart now but I piece it together and keep it in my rather extensive private library with myother classics.  Fairy tales written way back then often were very violent at times as this one is even though it is written in a stylefor children.  Stories were more realistic then.  Anyhow this movie I rated with 5 stars because not only was it very faithful to thebook but extremely well made, with a superb cast and excellent special effects.  Captain Hook was especially chock full of nastinessand there was Smee crawling at his boot tops.  The only change was that Capt. Hook was played by the same actor who playedMr. Darling.  Still, no big deal and if fact it worked well in the movie.  Some of the surreal effects during the first journey to Neverland was weird but added to the fantasy.  And like in the book, Hook doesn't hesitate to kill, even his own crew.  Its hard to figureout how he replaces them.  Watch the movie NEVERLAND: they kind of find a way,  Anyhow Peter also will kill if he finds itnecessary.All the old gang is there; the Indians, the mermaids (not very nice!) nasty pirates and the Lost Boys.  The flying effects are verywell done, including a very cute but very jealous Tinker Bell.  Tink trys to have Wendy killed but gets exiled by Peter in return.There is a lovely flying-dance sequence between Peter & Wendy but unfortunately ends in a snit with Wendy wanting to returnto England.  This whole story is basically an adolescent lovestory, innocent and touching.  But like all dreams it does come toan end, after Peter rescues Wendy and the Lost Boys from the nefarious,nasty,unwashed pirates!!  Hook is eaten by the Crockand the Ship is commandeered by Peter and the aid of the fairies including a forgiven Tink, take Wendy, her brothers and theLost Boys back to London in a beautifully filmed sequence.  Mr Darling and his sexy wife adopt the lost boys, and Peter andTink return to Neverland.  There is an additional scene in the extras showing Peter returning some years later only to findWendy grown and with children.  She agrees to let the children visit  Neverland some day.I just fell in love with this ultimate Peter Pan!!  Disneys is very good but this film is better.  Note: I got this Peter Pan as wellas Disneys version from AMAZON, where I get all my DVDS.Some years ago (1976-77) I visited London and stayed in a Hotel near Kesington Gardens.  One of the first things I did therewas visit the famous statue of the little lost boy that so entertained me when I was a child.

The cast is excellent and each plays their part to the fullest.  The sets look like they just popped out of a story book and the music is really an adventure in itself.  While Peter Pan is commonly known as being a story for children, this film adaptation really doesn't hold back on the darker aspects of the story.  The mermaids aren't the beautiful creatures we think of them as in stories but are instead red haired ,green skinned ,sharp toothed and feral in appearance.  The home underground is absolutely amazing and the forest is breath-taking.  I also love the fairies especially the scene where they are dancing.  This is one of the films most memorable and breath-taking scenes. The pirate ship and the sword fighting scenes are classic. The DVD includes behind the scenes footage of literally almost everything in the movie and there is also a very special deleted scene when Wendy grows up.  The actors are great with Jeremy Sumpter as Peter Pan, Rachel Hurd Wood as the beautiful Wendy and Jasson Isaacs in the dual role of Mr. Darling/Captain Hook.  Lynn redgrave is perfect in the role of the stuffy Aunt Milicent but still manages to have a certain loving quality at the same time.  Overall, this is a great movie and while being somewhat over-looked when compared to some recent family films, this version will go down in cinema history as being a spectacular tour de force for the child in everyone!!!!",5,Get taken away to NEVERLAND!!!!!,1083628800,"05 4, 2004",2004,1520,"['originally', 'saw', 'movie', 'theatres', 'i', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'special', 'effects', 'music', 'cast', 'excellent', 'plays', 'part', 'fullest', 'sets', 'look', 'just', 'popped', 'story', 'book', 'music', 'really', 'adventure', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'commonly', 'known', 'being', 'story', 'children', 'film', 'adaptation', 'really', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'darker', 'aspects', 'story', 'mermaids', 'are', ""n't"", 'beautiful', 'creatures', 'think', 'stories', 'are', 'instead', 'red', 'haired', 'green', 'skinned', 'sharp', 'toothed', 'feral', 'appearance', 'home', 'underground', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'forest', 'breath-taking', 'also', 'love', 'fairies', 'especially', 'scene', 'where', 'are', 'dancing', 'one', 'films', 'most', 'memorable', 'breath-taking', 'scenes', 'pirate', 'ship', 'sword', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'are', 'classic', 'DVD', 'scenes', 'footage', 'literally', 'almost', 'everything', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'special', 'deleted', 'scene', 'when', 'Wendy', 'up', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Rachel', 'Hurd', 'Wood', 'beautiful', 'Wendy', 'Jasson', 'Isaacs', 'dual', 'role', 'Mr.', 'Darling/Captain', 'Hook', 'Lynn', 'redgrave', 'perfect', 'role', 'stuffy', 'Aunt', 'Milicent', 'still', 'have', 'certain', 'loving', 'quality', 'same', 'time', 'Overall', 'great', 'movie', 'being', 'somewhat', 'over-looked', 'when', 'compared', 'recent', 'family', 'films', 'version', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'cinema', 'history', 'being', 'spectacular', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'child', 'everyone']",N/A

Sure it has all the same plot details as the other movies but this one adds an attraction between Peter and Wendy.  Jeremy Sumpter (Frailty) and Rachel Hurd-Wood ""in her first role"" are well casted as Peter and Wendy. They both have really good chemestry. Sumpter completely nails the role of Peter. He's afraid of growing up and enjoys being a kid a lot yet there's still a sadness to him. He's lonely and wants to be with Wendy but without speaking of love and feelings. Anyway him and Wood are great in their roles and it's the best acting I've seen from young actors in awhile.Jason Isaacs (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets) is equally good as Captain Hook. He plays the part more serious and scary than Dennis Hoffman did in Hook.  Isaacs clearly wants to kill Peter and is ruthless and deadly.  The Neverland scenery looks a lot better than it did in Hook too. Peter Pan has fantasy, adventure and romance and is great for the whole family. It can seem dark but no kids die like in Hook where Rufio dies. It can be violent but it never over does it.

805846,A1OBJ2263JCK5,B0001HAISG,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[3, 4]","All my life I've been a big fan of J.M. Barrie's classic children's story of the little boy, who refused to grow up, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. But whenever I saw screen or stageplay versions of the tale, I was always left wanting. Why was Peter played by adult women with pixish hairdos (yes, I know it's a theatre tradition)? Why was Captain Hook a slapstick buffoon? Why did Never Neverland always look so fake? And why did it seem like they had sanitized Barrie's original story? In my my mind I always had a vision of a more realistic movie version of Pan. Well, my dream has come true with the release of Director, P.J. Hogan's live action version of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. At last, the folks in Hollywood (or Australia in this case) got it right! Most people know the jist of the story. It is Wendy's last night in the Darling family's Victorian, nursery. On that night Wendy and her younger brothers, Michael &amp; John discover the magical, Peter Pan (and his fairy sidekick, Tinkerbelle). He convices the three to fly back to Never Neverland so Wendy can tell stories and be a 'Mother' to a gang of kids known as the &quot;Lost Boys&quot;. Once there, they have adventures, meeting up with mermaids, indian warriors, pirates and Peter's arch-nemesis, Captain James Hook. Where do you start with on describing how wonderful this film version is? Director/Writer P.J. Hogan has created a storybook fantasy world which is like a surreal dreamscape. Hogan pretty closely sticks to the original Barrie tale. He shows us the adventurous childhood delights of Never Neverland without sanitizing it's dangers (witness the spooky scene with those evil looking mermaids!). The casting in the film is almost perfect. Juvenile actress, Rachael Hurd-Wood plays Wendy Darling without any pretensions. She dosn't over act or try to be cute or cloying. She does a really good job of showing us a young lady, who is overcoming her fears of leaving childhood behind and entering adolecence. Jeremy Sumpter is fine (but a little wooden) in the lead title role. He shows us Peter Pan as heroic, but also a tragic figure, because he refuses to grow up and accept the love he really craves. But the film really belongs to actor, Jason Isaacs, who pretty much steals the show in the dual roles of Mr.Darling &amp; Captain Hook. Instead of being a merely villainous, slapstick buffoon, his Hook seems like evil incarnate. His eyes are bloodshot and his hair is bedraggled. This Hook just oozes menace and should join Darth Vader and Oz's Wicked Witch in a &quot;Movie Villain's Hall of Fame&quot;. Everything in this film is just done so right. From the eye popping special effects (the flying scenes are amazing), to the marvelous cinematography to the brilliant set design and the warm musical score. It is all so perfect. The &quot;Peter Pan&quot; DVD has been wonderfully mastered. The widescreen picture is crisp and clear and the 5.1 sound is great. The DVD is loaded with extras including a series of very short clips, which talk about everything from the Pan story's history to how the special effects were done. Includes extensive (but short) backstage views of the movie's making. This film is great entertainment for adults and kids alike (though parents might want to prescreen this for very young children).

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[0, 0]","This first thing that I realized about this movie was that had I been a child when I watched it, I would have thought it to be one of the greatest movies ever.  However, I'm a few years removed from being a child and I found this movie to be average entertainment for adults.  I'll give it four stars for the fact that if I were ten, I'd give it five stars, but I'm almost thirty, and that part of me says to give it three stars.The visuals in this film are beautiful.  I've seen few imaginary worlds depicted on film as magical as Neverland.  It is breathtaking at times.  The clouds, the pirate ship, and even the crocodile turn this movie into one big children's dream.  The costumes were nice as well.  The special effects were iffy at times, but for a youngster, they were perfect.  The swordplay in the film hearkened back to the days of Errol Flynn's ""Robin Hood.""The acting, lead by the grand performances of Jason Isaacs(Capt. Hook/Mr. Darling) and Rachel Hurd-Wood(Wendy), was above average.  As Hook, Isaacs was downright evil to not only the Lost Boys and the Darlings, but to his own crew as well.  Hurd-Wood had everything going for her as the strong-minded and adventurous Wendy.  Jeremy Sumpter had the look of young Peter Pan, but his acting was a little wooden at times.  Lynn Redgrave gave a solid performance in the small role of Aunt Millicent, and Olivia Williams was good as Mrs. Darling.  Perhaps the most standout performance of them all was the lovely Ludivine Sagnier.  As Tinkerbell, she obviously had the most playful part in the movie.  Her face was like rubber, full of twisted and funny faces.  Her jealousy of Wendy was played out almost to a cruel level, making her one of the hardest characters to pull for, but she loved Peter so dearly that you really wanted to cheer her on.  The rest of the cast did a superb job.As you probably know, Peter Pan is the boy who wants to stay young forever.  Hook is his arch-enemy who has a croc on his tail.  It loved the taste of his hand so much, that it wants to sample the rest of his body as well. The lost boys just want a mother with none of the attachments.  In other words, they just want someone to love them when they are hurt or scared, and tell them a good story once in awhile.  Wendy wants adventure, but also the security of home.In closing, if you have young children(ages 5-13), they'll probably enjoy this movie for its swashbuckling adventure and wonderful story.  Older kids will most likely avoid this one.  Adults will find it nice to think back to the days when they were a kid and wished that they too, could be young forever.",4,"Great Visuals, Good Acting, Fun Story",1096934400,"10 5, 2004",2004,2623,"['first', 'thing', 'realized', 'movie', 'was', 'had', 'been', 'child', 'when', 'watched', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'ever', 'However', ""'m"", 'few', 'years', 'removed', 'being', 'child', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'average', 'entertainment', 'adults', ""'ll"", 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'fact', 'were', 'ten', ""'d"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', ""'m"", 'almost', 'thirty', 'part', 'give', 'three', 'stars.The', 'visuals', 'film', 'are', 'beautiful', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'imaginary', 'worlds', 'depicted', 'film', 'as', 'magical', 'Neverland', 'breathtaking', 'times', 'clouds', 'pirate', 'ship', 'even', 'crocodile', 'turn', 'movie', 'one', 'big', 'children', 'dream', 'costumes', 'were', 'nice', 'as', 'well', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'iffy', 'times', 'youngster', 'were', 'perfect', 'swordplay', 'film', 'hearkened', 'back', 'days', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'acting', 'lead', 'grand', 'performances', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'Capt', 'Hook/Mr', 'Darling', 'Rachel', 'Hurd-Wood', 'Wendy', 'was', 'above', 'average', 'Hook', 'Isaacs', 'was', 'downright', 'evil', 'not', 'only', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'Darlings', 'own', 'crew', 'as', 'well', 'Hurd-Wood', 'had', 'everything', 'going', 'strong-minded', 'adventurous', 'Wendy', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', 'had', 'look', 'young', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'acting', 'was', 'little', 'wooden', 'times', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'gave', 'solid', 'performance', 'small', 'role', 'Aunt', 'Millicent', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'was', 'good', 'Mrs', 'Darling', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'standout', 'performance', 'was', 'lovely', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'Tinkerbell', 'obviously', 'had', 'most', 'playful', 'part', 'movie', 'face', 'was', 'rubber', 'full', 'twisted', 'funny', 'jealousy', 'Wendy', 'was', 'played', 'out', 'almost', 'cruel', 'level', 'making', 'one', 'hardest', 'characters', 'pull', 'loved', 'Peter', 'so', 'dearly', 'really', 'wanted', 'cheer', 'rest', 'cast', 'did', 'superb', 'job.As', 'probably', 'know', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'boy', 'who', 'stay', 'young', 'forever', 'Hook', 'arch-enemy', 'who', 'croc', 'tail', 'loved', 'taste', 'hand', 'so', 'much', 'sample', 'rest', 'body', 'as', 'well', 'lost', 'boys', 'just', 'want', 'mother', 'none', 'attachments', 'other', 'words', 'just', 'want', 'someone', 'love', 'when', 'are', 'hurt', 'scared', 'tell', 'good', 'story', 'once', 'awhile', 'Wendy', 'adventure', 'also', 'security', 'home.In', 'closing', 'have', 'young', 'children', '5-13', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'swashbuckling', 'adventure', 'wonderful', 'story', 'Older', 'kids', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'avoid', 'one', 'Adults', 'will', 'find', 'nice', 'think', 'back', 'days', 'when', 'were', 'kid', 'wished', 'too', 'could', 'be', 'young', 'forever']",N/A

A return to the original stage classic. I never really liked the Disney Peter Pan. I remember the old stage version put on television for years as a child...with Mary Martin in it, and though I loved that, when I read the original story, it was not supposed to be a musical.I've taken a real shine to the characters Jason Issacs play's. He seems to like to be the scoundrel in so many parts. His take on Darling and Captain Hook are exactly on cue...I laughed my head off through much of the tangles between Pan (Jeremy Sumpter) and Hook, because Pan was the smart aleck kid who got the best of an arrogant Hook. The look on Hook's face when the croc comes around is great. He loses all sense of time, freezes, and there is a comic pathos there because he feels so sorry for himself! This part made me realize that Malfoy in the Harry Potter movies is played by this same man...what a change, from dark and hairy, to golden blonde. And what's fun is you despise Malfoy, but kind of feel sorry for Hook!The original story was about growing up, and that in-between stage we all reach as pre-teens. The story was written in the early 1900's, and played on stage continually after that. It's amazing that 12 year old boys and girls in some ways remain constant...unfortunately, we allow them to lose their innocence too fast.My granddaughter adored this on cable...so I bought it for all of us to enjoy over and over again.

Jason Isaacs's performance as both Mr. Darling and Captain Hook is, in short, brilliant. His acting with Jeremy Sumpter (Peter Pan) and Rachel Hurd-Wood ( Wendy Darling ) is really just pure magic. Jeremy is a wonderful Peter. With his good looks and golden curls he almost makes me think of the sun god, Apollo. Just his presence is unique and it is very hard to take your eyes off him, because his acting is so believable.I also strongly believe that the movie just wouldn't be the same if it weren't for the music and the artwork. The costumes are brilliant and really make the cast stand out. Everyone works so well together.  The special featuers are also a special treat. Duchess Sarah Fergusoneven gives a little speach about Peter Pan's past and his meaning in today's society. You also learn about some of the tragedies that author John Berrie faced as a young boy, and the first idea that became the Peter Pan story.This is a great family movie.

It is also one that, like its protagonist, never grows old. The tale probably reached its widest audience with the well-known musical stage version starring Mary Martin (and most recently Cathy Rigby) as well as the Disney cartoon version of the early 1950s. There apparently was a silent film adaptation made at some point but aside from that there has never been a plain, non-musicalized live action version on the big screen. That is, until now. The result is truly spectacular. The filmmakers have been fortunate in finding young actors and actresses with exactly the right look and temperament for the main characters (that of course, being Peter and the three Darling children, Wendy, Michael and John). Young Jeremy Sumpter, playing Peter Pan, is particularly impressive, instilling the part with just the right amount of boyish mischievousness without going over the top. His relationship with Wendy (played by talented Rachel Hurd-Wood) is very believeable; despite reviews to the contrary, there is nothing that parents should object to. The rest of the cast, (with the sole exception of the young woman in the role of Tinkerbell, whose only direction was apparently to act as obnoxiously as possible) is ideal as well. Captain Hook is a delightfully menacing enemy, Smee is the usual goofy sidekick, and the infamous ticking crocodile is in rare form.

805862,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001HAISG,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[209, 212]","I do not think that most kids can appreciate how great of a movie P.J. Hogan has made with this new version of &quot;Peter Pan.&quot;  However you really have to be familiar with not only all of the various versions of the story from Disney to Steven Spielberg but also J. M. Barrie's original plays and books to really appreciate everything that is in this movie.  Hogan's purpose was to go back to that original material, but it is impossible not to touch upon everything that has come since then.  My generation cannot hear the words &quot;I do believe in fairies&quot; without thinking of Mary Martin beckoning out from our television sets beseeching us to clap (or when Smee turns and gives an aside to the viewer).On the one hand there are the fantastic elements as Peter Pan (Jeremy Sumpter) and the Darling children Wendy (Rachel Hurd-Wood), John (Harry Newell), and Michael (Freddie Popplewell) fly off to Never-Land.  But this is a more realistic Never-Land than every before for all the wonderful computer generated images.  More importantly, these are more realistic children than ever before.  Peter Pan is the boy who will never grow up, but he is also on the cusp of puberty, as is Wendy.  Into the Darling household comes Aunt Millicent (Lynn Redgrave), who insists that Wendy is not a girl anymore and while her father should start looking for marital prospects at the bank where he works, the more immediate goal is to move her out of the bedroom she shares with her brothers.  When Peter Pan appears on the windowsill and requires his shadow to be sewn back onto this feet, Wendy not only does the sewing but accepts his offer to come to Never-Land because she too desperately wants to avoid growing up.In this &quot;Peter Pan&quot; a kiss is more than just a thimble.  This is not to suggest that there is a sexual element to these children or this film that parents need to worry about, but there is the potential for sexuality in Peter and Wendy.  It is around the corner and that is important because there is a price to pay for never growing up, and never before has the tragic flip side of Peter Pan's joyful and magical existence been so obvious in telling this tale.  Adults will recognize that period of their life it all it's metaphoric splendor in this film.We also have the most realistic Captain Hook (Jason Issacs) of our acquaintance as well.  Hogan continues the long-standing tradition of having the actor who plays Hook do double duty as Mr. Darling as well, but in this richer vision of the story they are as opposite as night and day.  When this Hook crosses swords with Peter we know that they it might look like great fun, but these two are deadly serious about the final, fatal outcome.  More importantly, when this Hook blusters and bellows he manages to do it without falling into parody.  This is Hook as Barrie intended him to be, larger than life, but still a real figure.Ultimately the power running throughout this story is the power of the story.  The Lost Boys are despearate for a mother and to them Wendy can fulfill the role because she has what they consider to be the single requirement: she can tell stories.  But there is another, more important requirement for a mother, and this film remembers that as well in the end when the Darling children return to their mother (Olivia Williams).  I especially liked the way the film plays the beginning of the reunion of the scene, a nice underscoring of the idea that you can wish for something so hard that you do not notice when you have it.This is a stunning visual film, but it is also a film of substance that mines Barrie's idea of the boy who would not grow up for everything it is worth.  This &quot;Peter Pan&quot; has a depth greater than every all the other versions we have seen on the silver screen to date.  This is a glorious film and even if few will really appreciate it the way it truly deserves, there is still the fact that just coming into contact with it will open the minds of its viewers to the greater realm of meaning and significance.  Besides, there is always the possibility that somewhere down the road as they enjoy this beautiful film again and again, that eventually they will appreciate what it is all about.",5,One of the greatest children's films for adults of all time,1083888000,"05 7, 2004",2004,4243,"['do', 'not', 'think', 'most', 'kids', 'can', 'appreciate', 'how', 'great', 'movie', 'P.J', 'Hogan', 'made', 'new', 'version', 'quot', 'Peter', 'Pan.', 'quot', 'However', 'really', 'have', 'be', 'familiar', 'not', 'only', 'various', 'versions', 'story', 'Disney', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'also', 'J.', 'M.', 'Barrie', 'original', 'plays', 'books', 'really', 'appreciate', 'everything', 'movie', 'Hogan', 'purpose', 'was', 'go', 'back', 'original', 'material', 'impossible', 'not', 'touch', 'everything', 'come', 'then', 'generation', 'can', 'not', 'hear', 'words', 'quot', 'do', 'believe', 'fairies', 'quot', 'thinking', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'beckoning', 'out', 'television', 'sets', 'beseeching', 'clap', 'when', 'Smee', 'aside', 'viewer', '.On', 'one', 'hand', 'are', 'fantastic', 'elements', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', 'Darling', 'children', 'Wendy', 'Rachel', 'Hurd-Wood', 'John', 'Harry', 'Newell', 'Michael', 'Freddie', 'Popplewell', 'fly', 'off', 'Never-Land', 'more', 'realistic', 'Never-Land', 'wonderful', 'computer', 'generated', 'images', 'More', 'importantly', 'are', 'more', 'realistic', 'children', 'ever', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'boy', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'grow', 'up', 'also', 'cusp', 'puberty', 'Wendy', 'Into', 'Darling', 'household', 'Aunt', 'Millicent', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'who', 'Wendy', 'not', 'girl', 'anymore', 'father', 'should', 'start', 'looking', 'marital', 'prospects', 'bank', 'where', 'more', 'immediate', 'goal', 'move', 'bedroom', 'shares', 'brothers', 'When', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'windowsill', 'shadow', 'be', 'sewn', 'back', 'feet', 'Wendy', 'not', 'only', 'sewing', 'offer', 'come', 'Never-Land', 'too', 'desperately', 'avoid', 'growing', 'quot', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'quot', 'kiss', 'more', 'just', 'thimble', 'not', 'suggest', 'sexual', 'element', 'children', 'film', 'parents', 'need', 'worry', 'about', 'potential', 'sexuality', 'Peter', 'Wendy', 'corner', 'important', 'price', 'pay', 'never', 'growing', 'up', 'never', 'before', 'tragic', 'flip', 'side', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'joyful', 'magical', 'existence', 'been', 'so', 'obvious', 'telling', 'tale', 'Adults', 'will', 'recognize', 'period', 'life', 'metaphoric', 'splendor', 'film.We', 'also', 'have', 'most', 'realistic', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'Jason', 'Issacs', 'acquaintance', 'as', 'well', 'Hogan', 'long-standing', 'tradition', 'having', 'actor', 'who', 'Hook', 'do', 'double', 'duty', 'Mr', 'Darling', 'as', 'well', 'richer', 'vision', 'story', 'are', 'as', 'opposite', 'night', 'day', 'When', 'Hook', 'swords', 'Peter', 'know', 'might', 'look', 'great', 'fun', 'two', 'are', 'deadly', 'serious', 'final', 'fatal', 'outcome', 'More', 'importantly', 'when', 'Hook', 'blusters', 'do', 'falling', 'parody', 'Hook', 'Barrie', 'intended', 'be', 'larger', 'life', 'still', 'real', 'figure.Ultimately', 'power', 'running', 'story', 'power', 'story', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'are', 'despearate', 'mother', 'Wendy', 'can', 'fulfill', 'role', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'single', 'requirement', 'can', 'tell', 'stories', 'more', 'important', 'requirement', 'mother', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'end', 'when', 'Darling', 'children', 'return', 'mother', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'especially', 'liked', 'way', 'film', 'beginning', 'reunion', 'scene', 'nice', 'underscoring', 'idea', 'can', 'wish', 'something', 'so', 'hard', 'do', 'not', 'notice', 'when', 'have', 'it.This', 'stunning', 'visual', 'film', 'also', 'film', 'substance', 'Barrie', 'idea', 'boy', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'grow', 'up', 'everything', 'worth', 'quot', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'quot', 'depth', 'greater', 'other', 'versions', 'have', 'seen', 'silver', 'screen', 'date', 'glorious', 'film', 'even', 'few', 'will', 'really', 'appreciate', 'way', 'deserves', 'still', 'fact', 'just', 'coming', 'contact', 'will', 'open', 'minds', 'viewers', 'greater', 'realm', 'meaning', 'significance', 'always', 'possibility', 'somewhere', 'road', 'enjoy', 'beautiful', 'film', 'again', 'again', 'eventually', 'will', 'appreciate', 'what']",N/A

However, in the end of the movie, Peter realizes that he does feel - for Wendy, but still chooses to remain a boy forever while Wendy grows up. It is definitely more mature than the animated one or even the stage version, so I would not recommend that very young children see it. However, for the slightly older crowd, it is a very good version of one of the finest classical stories ever told.",4,"A modern, more mature version of a classic story",1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,738,"['really', 'liked', 'new', 'version', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'movies', '1st', '2nd', 'animated', 'ones', 'live', 'musicals', 'where', 'female', 'actor', 'plays', 'Peter', 'favorite', 'more', 'mature', 'other', 'ones', 'very', 'clearly', 'disadcantage', 'remaining', 'young', 'forever', 'will', 'never', 'develop', 'true', 'feelings', 'However', 'end', 'movie', 'Peter', 'feel', 'Wendy', 'still', 'remain', 'boy', 'forever', 'Wendy', 'up', 'definitely', 'more', 'mature', 'animated', 'one', 'even', 'stage', 'version', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'see', 'However', 'slightly', 'older', 'crowd', 'very', 'good', 'version', 'one', 'finest', 'classical', 'stories', 'ever', 'told']",N/A

Those who say this was vulgar, violent, and dark: I have news: THE BOOK WAS VULGAR, VIOLENT AND DARK in some places! The book was fierce and fiery, and every adaptation so far has been lighthearted beyond reason. The boy who played Peter did so wonderfully. He had spunk, cockiness, charm, sorrow, and (a refreshing change) the fact that he's MALE all added up to make him a good choice. I didn't like the girl who played Wendy purely for visual reasons (her face is all unproportionate, it scared me). Otherwise, all the characters were excellent looking. The costumes closely matched the book, most of the scenes were pretty good, the fight scenes were nearly realistic, and there was humor, sadness, loss, regret, redemption, forgiveness, and love - all the aspects of a good children's movie.

805870,AN94YI3URSAII,B0001HAISG,Lostgirl,"[4, 5]","Everything you remember is here: Peter Pan, the Lost Boys, Captain Hook, and the ticking crocodile. But this isn't the Peter Pan you though you knew. Previous adaptations highlight childhood as an ideal time of innocence and play. Those elements are very much in place here but there are also darker elements of danger, fear, and even the begining of sexuality. In other words- it presents a realistic vision of childhood within the context of a fantasy.We open in London where the Banks children are told stories of Peter Pan and Neverland. But things are changing. Aunt Millicent points out that the eldest of the Darlings, Wendy, is approaching adulthood and should begin thinking about marriage. Peter Pan on the other hand is the boy who never changes and new grows up. But that also means that he's perpetually on the brink of puberty. In Wendy he finds a maternal figure that he and the Lost Boys crave, but also a budding love interest. The kiss between them is far from a thimble.  That's not to say that there is any overt sexuality here. Peter and Wendy are very much innocent children in that regard but there in the hint of it being a possibility someday. Captain Hook is representative of all our childhood fears. He's far more menacing than his Disney counterpart but never so scarey that kids can't handle it. The pirates and mermaids also have a degree of menace but it's something that children can face in order to conquer. Overall this isn't a simplistic, idealized view of childhood but rather a depiction of childhood as a time of magic, innocence, fun, fear, and anticipation of the future.The special effects and CGI are visually wonderful and gives us a more believeable Neverland. It's still a fantasy but we are able to believe in it for the duration of the film. The suspension of disbelief that the film requires (in older viewers at least) is aided by fine performances all around. Jeremy Sumpter is mischivous and cute, and slightly obnoxious at times as the title character and Rachel Hurd-Wood is beautiful, adventurous and lively as Wendy. Ludavine Sangier is comic and slightly homicidal as Tinkerbell and Jason Isaacs steals his scenes in a dual role as Captain Hook and Mr. Darling.Usually a ""family film"" means something adults have to sit through while kids enjoy it.

It cannot be easy to produce something that vividly depicts a fantasic world where children can fly with faeries, that portrays sympathetic characters, and can entertain children and adults at the same time. This movie does all of these things.Visually, every frame of Peter Pan looks like a color plate from a Victorian storybook. Peter's shadow dances and leaps; Tinker Bell has the energy and attitude of more than one human; there are snowstorms and thunderstorms and sunsets. We finally have the technology to make a proper Peter Pan movie, and this one makes full use of it.But it's so much more than CGI effects. This has to be the most emotionally layered Pan film, if not children's film, ever made. The psychology of the children and the adults is develed into in a way that few movies can do without getting preachy. It's still the same never-grow-up story, but here we see Wendy as a child who is just about to succumb to the turmoil of adolescence. She and Peter, who are brilliantly portrayed by their respective actors, begin to discover romantic attraction through each other. During their time together in Neverland, Peter and Wendy go through what most people experience over at least a year-long committed relationship. Captain Hook points out to Peter that Wendy cannot stay with him if he won't grow up, and that's something that takes adults a while to realize. Meanwhile, Mr. Darling is trying to move up in society; Mrs. Darling doesn't pay enough attention to her kids; and the children's aunt is trying to make sure Wendy finds a suitable husband, which is something that she apparently did not accomplish in her own life. There are traces of Sigmund Freud in this retelling of the story, which does not make it ""dirty"" or unsuitable for children, but it gives the adults some things to think about. Wendy causes a scandal at school when she draws a picture in her notebook of a boy flying above her bed. Mr. Darling and Captain Hook are played by the same actor, which sets up the implication that Wendy and her brothers are essentially battling their own father. Even Hook and Tinker Bell have an odd flirtation of sorts. I don't want to make it sound disgusting or anything, but this Peter Pan brings up issues that other versions have only suggested.The magic and romance are also punctuated with witty humor, like The Princess Bride or The Brothers Grimm. Smee never gets too much important but some of the best lines in the film are from his own dry observations.

I was disappointed.Sure it has great effects and brilliant cinematography (I love the image of Wendy laying on the grass), but for all its stunning visuals, the film never decides what it wants to be. At times it hints of a darker, more adult drama, but each time it dead-ends, leaving me exasperated and wishing this hadn't been made with children in mind.The acting in the film ranges the whole spectrum. Rachel Hurd-Wood, as Wendy, is marvelous, in honesty I think one of the best performances of the year. Jeremy Sumpter is badly miscast as the title character, however. It's not his fault though..its just that he's the only American in a cast full of British folks and he sticks out like a sore thumb. Jason Isaacs, as Hook/Mr. Darling, is good but not great. Lynn Redgrave's invented character, ""Aunt Millicent,"" is really weird. Speaking of weird, Tinkerbell is a very strange creation here.

805879,A152C8GYY25HAH,B0001HAISG,Matthew Horner,"[5, 5]","""Peter Pan"" flew into theaters last December. Its flight was short-lived because family audiences seemed to show little interest in yet another telling of the century old story. It's always difficult, though, to figure out why good movies like this one fail [or why bad ones succeed]. This version - to me, the best one ever made - doesn't hesitate to show the darker side of the tale.We all know the story. Wendy Darling and her two brothers are visited by a boy named Peter Pan, who lives in Never Never Land, where adventures are endless and where children never have to grow up. The three siblings decide to go there with Peter. Being children, they don't think much about the consequences of their actions. These include how much they will be missed by their loving parents and odd it might be to be forever young.I love how dreamlike Never Never Land is portrayed here. Maybe it was all a dream Wendy had, maybe not. She has, after all, a vivid imagination.

805880,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B0001HAISG,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[6, 17]","I don't remember loving the Disney version of Peter Pan that much, but I have a gorgeous illustrated book sitting at home, which I've had since I was a kid (and continues the story of Peter coming back as Wendy grows up), and I love Hook! I thought this would be the same, but it wasn't. Boo. I couldn't be bothered watching it after an hour, so I gave up.I don't know what it was about this movie, but mainly for me, it was really boring. And it was a lot darker than I remember the kid's story too. I didn't like Jason Isaacs, who played Hook, but then I did grow up with the utterly camp Dustin Hoffman playing Hook in Hook. :) (And something I didn't know, following tradition in both theatre and film, the actor portraying Captain Hook is the same actor portraying Mr. Darling, in this case, it's Jason Isaacs. I thought they looked familiar!) Also the kids played on my nerves a bit. Not so much the actors playing Wendy & Peter, but John & Michael. And Smee just wasn't the same as Bob Hoskins playing him.It's quite weird as well, there's a lot more of a relationship between Wendy & Peter than I've seen before - shall we soon be seeing an adult version?! I'm not sure what it was, but there was a lot of talk at the start of the movie, where they talk about Wendy having a ""kiss"" at the corner of her mouth - what was all that about?! And it sounded like they were talking of marrying her off when she was barely 13! I thought this was made in the early 1900s, not the medieval days! (And don't even get me started on the dog as a nanny - I didn't get that as a kid, and I don't get it as an adult.)Jason Sumpter was OK playing Peter, he's totally your stereotypical picture of Peter, but there was something always quite right. You could see how much he grew up during the film - he went from 5 feet tall to 5' 8"" during filming. The window of the nursery had to be rebuilt 4 times because he kept hitting his head on it.The thing I loved about the book (and the wee bit in Hook) was Peter coming back and seeing Wendy growing up. Apparently, there was an alternate ending was shot where Peter meets the adult Wendy and her little daughter Jane. I don't know why this part of the story always appealed to me. (And seeing the Lost Boys grow up too - I loved that!)A cool little bit of trivia for you - the preview trailers for this film used music from the video game, ""Myst III: Exile"", but the music was never used in the film itself.The film was noticeably cut, and at one point badly, as I noticed it! (And that's saying something.) I have the region 2 version of the movie, and before I switched it off, Peter & Hook are fighting (in the cave I think), and it looks like Hook is about to headbutt, when we suddenly, and very abruptly cut to the little rowing boat. This was cut in order to secure a PG rating. I also think we lose the bit where John & Michael are hanging upside down, and on some versions you see them from behind, with their nightshirts over their heads.I found one similarity between this & Labyrinth, particularly since in the children's bedroom, there is a lot of pirate, mermaid etc stuff, very similar to the scenes in Labyrinth.The extras on this look pretty cool, and are split into different sections, some categorised under the different places that appear in this. The extras include: 11 featurettes; Visit the Darling House: Alternate Ending. What happens when Wendy is all grown up! Hilarious Deleted Scenes. In the dog house with Mr. Darling; Board the Pirate Ship: Through the Eyes of Captain Hook - Jason Isaacs' behind-the-scenes Home Video Footage! The Lost Pirate Song - The Swashbucklers sing a deleted tune; Explore the Neverland Forest: Tinkerbell - Behind the Fairy Dust. I Do Believe in Fairies - Inside the magical world of the fairies; Enter the Black Castle: Learning to Fly - Go on set to the ""Flying School"" training camp. Mermaids' Tale - Behind-the-scenes with these mysterious mermaids; Dig into the Home under the Ground: The Legacy of Pan - Duchess Sarah Ferguson gives an insider's look at how the story of Peter Pan came to be!I haven't seen another bad review about this movie, so I feel slightly disappointed to be giving it a two-star review. I'm going to keep the DVD though, as the extras look really good, and I might be persuaded to give it another try at some point.

It always seemed like a ""boy story"" to me, full of adventure but not substance.  The main characters were Peter Pan and Hook.Then last week my friends dragged me out to see this movie.  Wow!  This story is really about Wendy!  How cool!If you've only seen the Disney version, well, like so many other powerful stories, they watered it down and removed most of the power.  This is a story about that shock time in a girl's life, when you are just becoming a woman. And in the late 19th century, that is likely to mean the end of your freedom to be who you really are... especially if you are an active, imaginative girl like Wendy.I also think this movie is good for the Peter Pans among us... all those guys who don't want to grow up, but don't understand why their girlfriends keep leaving them.  If they can understand why Wendy can't stay in Neverland, maybe they might understand why THEY need to grow up in order to be with grown-up girls.This movie is NOT good for very small children.  I think it's going to be a little scary for the under-7 set, especially those little kids who can't seem to deal with ANY darkness in their fiction.  Hook is menacing in couple of ways I think they'll find both incomprehensible and disturbing.Good movie.  See it.  Bring your 10 year old (and up) daughters.

Barrie's timeless, ageless fantasy tale about the boy who wouldn't grow up. It's simply perfect from beginning to end. It stays true to the book, but also incorporates a few fresh ideas, that take nothing away from the original story.The actors are superb. Jeremy Sumpter is wonderful as the carefree, adventurous, cocky, yet innocent, Peter Pan, and Jason Issacs perfectly portrays the elegant, sophisticated, obsessive and downright bad Captain Hook. Rachel Hurd-Wood is excellent as Wendy, sharing with us her fears, desires and fantasies as she faces the choices that go hand in hand with growing up. The acting of the rest of the cast, especially the children's, is impressive, and the chemistry between them and the adults shines through on the screen.James Newton Howard's score is simply magical and seamlessly woven into the story and the film's stunning and splendid visuals.Even the special features are great, as they are presented in well-organized, short, little capsules that make them enjoyable and easy to watch even for children.This is the first live-action adaptation of J. M. Barrie's classic, and is such an excellent one that it should remain so for a very long time.

This movie is a stand-alone effort. It is not intended to be a prequel to the excellent Robin Williams movie, Hook. It is, I believe, the first ever live action cinematic version of the proper story of Peter Pan ever to be released. That fact alone should make this movie worth seeing.Secondly, it will feature the wonderful Jason Isaacs, who is superb at playing 'the bad guy' (as any who have seen The Patriot, or Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets would know). Apparently he also features as Mr Darling, Wendy, John and Michael's father. However, it will be the character of Captain Hook that I will be eagerly awaiting seeing him as.I recently saw a story on this movie on In Entertainment, and it looks as though we are going to be treated to a true version of Peter Pan, with all its glorious dark undertones. Anyone who has read the J M Barrie tale will know full well that Peter Pan was definitely not light and fluffy, as in the animated Disney version. Isaacs looks glorious as a very menacing Hook, and the young lad they have chosen to play the boy who never grows up (Jeremy Supmter, I believe his name is) definitely looks the part.The scenery looked magnificent, from the famous island to the infamous pirate ship. This movie is definitely going to be something to look forward to.I plan on taking my nephews to see it, but should they decide they don't want to go, I'll happily see it on my own. I've awarded five stars because we have to give some sort of star rating in order to write one of these things, but the five stars is because of the anticipation of a classic story told properly in all its glory for the first time.I expect this film to be outstanding, if only because of the presence of Jason Isaacs.

More than the stage musicals, and much more than the Disney version, this film remains quite true to JM Barrie's original book.  It caused a bit of commotion when it premiered, mostly from viewers who had grown up with the Disney or musical, but never actually read the book - they didn't quite get it!  As adults, they suddenly realized it was much more that the fluff they'd always thought &#34;Peter Pan&#34; was.  Yes, &#34;Peter Pan&#34; is about many things, among them a girl who is becoming a woman, and her father who must come to grips with this fact.  This is why Barrie insisted, when &#34;Peter Pan&#34; is staged, that Hook and Mr. Darling be played by the same actor (as it is with this film).  This subtext is present in the film.  That being said, there is nothing inappropriate for children (the sword-fighting is pretty bloodless except for a little flesh wound near the end); the subtext goes right over their heads, as they simply have not experienced growing up yet.  &#34;To grow up... would be an awfully big adventure!&#34;  It also is well-acted, the visual effects are spectacular, with Maxfield Parrish-style colors, and the soundtrack is at times sublimely beautiful, particularly during the grand reveal of Neverland.  I highly recommend it for anyone who seriously enjoys the book, or wishes to see a &#34;Peter Pan&#34; that can be enjoyed by all ages.

Loved it.WETA Digital quality CGI this was not, but despite what could be called ""crude"" CGI (let's say, rather, ""obvious""), this movie is just first class. The acting from the children is impressive, the story the most faithful to Barrie's original (EVER), and the characters cast the most faithful to Barrie's original (EVER). So with this formula, we get a wonderful story, acted beautifully.Jeremy Sumpter's Peter Pan is just perfect, with a dreamy wide-eyed look, and the right mix of cockiness and innocence that Peter Pan was meant to exude. Let's face it, he wasn't this angel-innocent little boy. He was cocky and proud and smart-alecky, and a formidible swordsman and ace flyer, and, boy, he KNEW it.Jason Isaacs' dual role as Mr Darling and Captain Hook (Wendy's psyche's evil creation of her father, didn't you know?) is perfect. Never before have we seen portrayed the perfect Cpt Hook, and now, here we have him at last - dashingly good-looking, silky, sophisticated (he uses the most extensive vocab of all his pirates, and look at that waistcoat embroidery!), obsessive, dauntless and downright vicious... and, em, look at the interaction between Hook and Wendy... it's disturbing if you think about it.What Hogan has done is rightfully refocus this film onto Wendy. It may be titled ""Peter Pan"" but it is Wendy's imagination we're exploring - her fears, her desires, her fantasy. Hook has to be destroyed because she is killing off the tyrant of her father, the threat to her imagination and ultimately the force that would rape her innocence.What we are given is a fabulous tale of a crossroads - we are right at that point in life where childhood cares are being grown out of, and adulthood looms frighteningly ahead. We can all hearken back to these days and identify with these children.Points to watch for that shows Hogan's genius in adaptation:-Wendy and Peter's fairy dance-Cpt Hook's final invitation to Wendy to join as a Pirate-The retelling of Nana's exile into the backyard (Wendy's school hiatus)Down points (demerits) - the too long ""I do believe in fairies! I do! I do!"" sequence. One great thing is that it shows that Hook is TOTALLY immune to the lures and influence of Peter Pan, where the rest of the world is not;And the demise of Hook - too immature for one of his calibre. Ought to have been left to the original end where he is able to ""triumph"" over Pan, Hook having not left good form in battle (though, Cpt Hook really cheats, but it clears his conscience);The original ending not left in. Maybe they ran out of money. Who knows, but it ought to have remained.So, thank goodness for Victorians to give us such disturbing glimpses into sexual psychology!

805899,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B0001HAISG,Only-A-Child,"[4, 5]","The mixed reviews for P.J. Hogan's 2003 hit ""Peter Pan"" leave you wondering if adults should be permitted to give a bad rating to a children's film. The vast majority of the reviews were positive ones, as the reviewers either liked the film themselves, or were convinced that it would be very entertaining viewing for children. The negative reviews came from adult critics who found little ""personal"" enjoyment and never really bothered about the children factor.I only bring this up because J. M. Barrie's play, while addressing early adolescent angst, was actually intended for adult audiences who presumably would be prompted to retrospectively analyze the angst of their own dim past. Thanks to the toning down of Barrie's basic theme in the Disney and Mary Martin versions, ""Peter Pan"" became almost exclusively a children's story. Then along came Hogan's version, which fused the thematic emphasis of the original with the children's entertainment emphasis of the others.Meaning that the film hits a home run with three very distinct target audiences. Once thing for sure is that this spectacular adaptation has almost universal appeal to preteen children, they will watch it countless times and you can't go wrong buying or renting it for that age group. And perceptive adolescents struggling with their own growing up process should relate to it. And finally, those adults (particularly males) who have consciously resisted the growing up process their entire lives should connect to this film like few others.But if you don't belong to these three groups you will wonder what all the fuss is about. The answer is that this film uniquely focuses on the maturation process, which most girls embrace about sixth grade and most boys resist until 9th grade (and would resist even longer if girls were not luring them with the most obvious benefit of growing up). Some boys stubbornly hold out like Peter Pan, usually because they do not have a Wendy to pull them forward, and when they finally surrender and move forward into adulthood, they are aware that they are abandoning something precious and will look back with regret on the moment for the rest of their lives.Now with that issue addressed this is ""Peter Pan"" and virtually everyone knows the story. It is a live action version superior to the stage version if only because it is unburdened by the play's odd cross-dressing tradition and the preschool Disney fusion of bad songs and lame slapstick humor. The production design should blow away all viewers, child and adult, with a dreamy Maxfield Parrish Victorian look and Barrie's treasure-map Neverland. The pacing is fast and Hogan shows a respectful grasp of how an imaginative child would visualize things while reading Barrie's story.""Peter Pan"" is really Wendy's story and there is no fault to find in Rachel Hurd-Wood's performance, which would be good enough to carry the film but fortunately is not required to do so. Wendy is second only to Wonderland's Alice as the bravest literary heroine of all time and Hogan nicely incorporates the many admirable qualities of her character into the story.Jeremy Sumpter's Peter is far more obnoxious than appealing, but isn't that what you would expect from a boy who refuses to grow old.Ludivine Sagnier's Tinkerbell provides comic relief to go with her homicidal tendencies; only adults want cute, children want pretend-nasty and this Tink is worthy of Barrie's original characterization. The ""save Tink"" audience chant is nicely incorporated into a full-cast montage.Hook is played with a controlled zest by Jason Isaacs, not quite the self-parody of a Gary Oldham performance but his restraint is exactly what is needed.Adults and children know that ""Peter Pan"" isn't so much suspension of disbelief as it is an exercise in self-knowing whimsy.

805908,A1BLA8N8G790R0,B0001HAISG,"Robert L. Hood ""Rev. Bob""","[1, 3]","When I was growing up I enjoyed the classic story of Peter Pan - but the movies were always lacking in some way.  The Disney ""standard"" is animated, which is an inherent barrier between you and the movie.  The various live-action adaptations, on stage and on screen, traditionally err by casting a young woman in the title role.  It's an understandable way to get someone with more acting experience as the star, but it just doesn't really do the job.  Also, there is a tendency with children's movies to make them short and simple; the Disney version clocks in at a mere 77 minutes, which just doesn't do the story justice.This version gets it exactly right, by discarding all of those traditions.The visual effects are advanced enough that Neverland can really come to life, but they don't make the mistake of making the movie ultra-realistic - witness the stylized spacescape that Peter and the children enter once they pass the clouds on their way from London.  Similarly, the movie does well by casting people who aren't Big Names, with the one exception of Lynn Redgrave in a minor role.  This means that you aren't watching Actors In Roles; you can lose yourself in the portrayals and let Jeremy Sumpter *be* Peter Pan for the duration of the movie.  It's not a musical, so you're not distracted by having the main characters burst into song every so often.  You can finally lose yourself in the movie, as every actor fits their role perfectly and the effects only serve to support the vision of what Neverland should have always been.In short, this is a magnificent adaptation of the classic story.  In my DVD collection, I have this as my only version of ""Peter Pan"" andHookas the sequel to it, and that is how I recommend the ""Peter Pan Experience"" to everyone.  Just as ""Hook"" did a remarkable job of imagining Peter Pan as a grownup, this movie gives the original story that same degree of reality that the other versions have so sorely lacked.",5,"Finally, Peter Pan's played by a boy!",1189555200,"09 12, 2007",2007,1956,"['When', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'enjoyed', 'classic', 'story', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'movies', 'were', 'always', 'lacking', 'way', 'Disney', 'standard', 'animated', 'inherent', 'barrier', 'movie', 'various', 'live-action', 'adaptations', 'stage', 'screen', 'traditionally', 'err', 'casting', 'young', 'woman', 'title', 'role', 'understandable', 'way', 'get', 'someone', 'more', 'acting', 'experience', 'star', 'just', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'job', 'Also', 'tendency', 'children', 'movies', 'make', 'short', 'simple', 'Disney', 'version', 'clocks', 'mere', '77', 'minutes', 'just', ""n't"", 'do', 'story', 'justice.This', 'version', 'exactly', 'right', 'discarding', 'traditions.The', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'advanced', 'enough', 'Neverland', 'can', 'really', 'come', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'mistake', 'making', 'movie', 'ultra-realistic', 'witness', 'stylized', 'spacescape', 'Peter', 'children', 'enter', 'once', 'pass', 'clouds', 'way', 'London', 'Similarly', 'movie', 'well', 'casting', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'Big', 'Names', 'one', 'exception', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'minor', 'role', 'are', ""n't"", 'watching', 'Actors', 'Roles', 'can', 'lose', 'portrayals', 'let', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', '*be*', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'duration', 'movie', 'not', 'musical', ""'re"", 'not', 'distracted', 'having', 'main', 'characters', 'burst', 'song', 'so', 'often', 'can', 'finally', 'lose', 'movie', 'actor', 'role', 'perfectly', 'effects', 'only', 'serve', 'support', 'vision', 'what', 'Neverland', 'should', 'have', 'always', 'been.In', 'short', 'magnificent', 'adaptation', 'classic', 'story', 'DVD', 'collection', 'have', 'only', 'version', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'sequel', 'how', 'recommend', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Experience', 'everyone', 'Just', 'Hook', 'did', 'remarkable', 'job', 'imagining', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'grownup', 'movie', 'original', 'story', 'same', 'degree', 'reality', 'other', 'versions', 'have', 'so', 'sorely', 'lacked']",N/A

805911,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001HAISG,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 4]","The latest film version of ""Peter Pan"" is a very fine rendition of the J. M. Barrie classic - which celebrates its centenary this year - all about the boy who refuses to grow up and the young girl who almost makes him change his mind.  Everyone is clearly familiar with the tale of Wendy and her two brothers who are magically whisked away to a place called Neverland, inhabited by pirates, fairies and a group of scruffy lads known as ""The Lost Boys,"" of whom Peter Pan is the valiant leader.  In this particular adaptation, it is the marvelous attention to detail - in setting, design, costumes and special effects - that makes the movie soar.The scenes set in Edwardian London have a lovely ""Mary Poppins"" look and feel to them, while those set in Neverland have the otherworldly quality needed to bring such fantasies to life.  Indeed, from first moment to last, the film is a visual feast, a masterpiece of image, design, and sheer technical wizardry.Equally important, writer/director P. J. Hogan never allows the technical aspects of the film to overwhelm the characters, conflicts and themes that have made this story such a universal favorite for nigh unto five generations of enraptured children.  The relationship between Peter and Wendy achieves a surprising emotional depth thanks to the two fine young actors, Jeremy Sumpter and Rachel Hurd-Wood, whose job it is to bring these beloved characters to life.  There's a particularly enchanting scene in which Peter and Wendy dance in the air, spinning high above the trees against an impossibly huge painted moon (shades of ""E.T.,"" the ultimate ""Peter Pan"" tribute).  Yet, the film is also not afraid to explore some of the darker themes inherent in the material.  I am speaking here not merely of the swordfights, deaths and malevolent villains (Jason Isaacs makes a splendid Captain Hook) but also of the strangely tragic nature of Peter Pan himself, a boy unable to feel as others do and unable to take his place in the natural scheme of things - being a member of a family, maturing into manhood, falling in love.  Eternal youth may be something we all dream about and yearn for from time to time, but it comes with a price we might not, in those moments of cold sober reality, be willing to pay.  As a result of confronting this paradox, the film possesses a bittersweet flavor that helps to dilute some of the treacle and sugary sentiment that could otherwise have taken over the story.  Also helpful is the dry British wit that runs all throughout the screenplay.It's become something of a clich&eacute; to describe a film as ""fine fun for the entire family,"" but, trite as it may be, that phrase does indeed apply to ""Peter Pan.""

I just did not see it.On the other hand, I can see why the film is not doing well at the BoxOffice. It wasn't really good.  While it was certainly more successful thanHOOK and there were parts of it I liked (the final Hook/Pan battle, Petertrying to close the window), the film as a whole did not succeed.I honsetly don't understand why this film is being touted as being more""faithful"" to Barrie's work than other versions.  Certainly the PETER PANmusical videos (Mary Martin and Cathy Rigby and even the long lost MiaFarrow) are FAR more faithful to Barrie's original play, as most of thedialogue in these videos is right out of Barrie's play.  This version wasabout 40% faithful --which in my eyes puts the Disney cartoon (at about 60%faithful) as being more faithful than this one.Some of my problems with the film:1. Tink --I hated her.  I mean HATED her in this version.  Not Tink thecharacter but the way she was portrayed.  I think they were aiming for herto be the equivelance of one of those stupid ""comic animal"" characters thatshow up in almost every Disney cartoon of late (Quasimoto's little gargoylefriends).  They kept cutting to her mugging for comic relief --but shesimply was not funny.2.  The Lost Boys --they were marginalized here.  We never even learnedtheir names until the END of the movie. And what about Slightly's famousline explaining his name ""Slightly Soiled, that's my name"".  Not there!3. There was no segment of the film revealing the life in Neverland. As soonas they arrive the battle with Hook begins.  What about the Piratesfollowing the boys following the indians? What about Michael sleeping in hisbasket?  What about Wendy telling the boys the story of Hamlet? What abouthe Neverbird? Peter being stranded on Marooner's rock? The poison cake? Thehouse in the trees ?  Faithful to Barrie's original?  not even CLOSE!4.  As someone who has been in productions of PETER PAN since  I was 8, Iwas surprised that I found no emotional connection to this film.  Even theending was just BLAH! The whole movie seemed Blah! And I really wanted tolike this movie.5.  Sumpter was good --and his American accent was not as bothersome to meas I thought it would it be.6.  Wend y was very good too.  And I did not mind the ""courting"" of her byHook.  He did this in the play too, though in the play there was no questionthat Hook wanted Wendy to be HIS mother.  In the film you weren't too surewhat he wanted.7.  The score was very HARRY POTTER --especially at the beginning.Well the movie wasn't HORRIBLE but it was not a great film either.  I willbuy the DVD when it comes out and hope for lots of extras and  deletedscenes.  But  I will not be going back to see this film in a movie theater.BTW --the people in the theater with me (about 20 altogether) were not thatthrilled with the film either.  When the Aunt ""adopts"" Slightly some girlsaid, rather loudly, ""This is so STUPID!""  And the kid in front of me wentfor large lengths of time NOT looking at the screen!

I have always been a Peter Pan fan, but had yet to see a motion picture that quite did the book justice--and I have finally found one!The movie is faithful to the book without being slavish though--after all, this IS someone else`s vision of a universally loved book. P.J. Hogan adds an interestingly *older* appeal while still retaining all the beauty, wonder, and young innocence of Peter and Neverland. Jeremy Sumpter is the boy always meant for this role. I could not *dream* up a better Peter, with his dirty feet and ethereal smile. Rachel Hurd-Wood is surprisingly convincing as Wendy, and Jason Isaacs a strangely seductive Captain Hook. I also love the new take on the mermaids, and the sheer realness of the Lost Boys. The effects are almost liquid, they fit so well--I`m quite impressed with the flying scenes most of all.This is undoubtedly the best Pan adaptation to date, stunning in story and setting (filmed in Australia). James Newton Howard blends a perfect meeting of old and young feelings into the score. It made me almost sad that I wasn`t little anymore, even though I`m really no more than a teenager at sixteen. It was the feeling of security and fun that trickles away with the years, and Peter Pan has always aided me on helping me regain that sense of wonder for everything around me. This film is no exception. ^^The `I do believe in fairies` scene was absolutely magical.I loved the chemistry between Peter and Wendy--and the fact that it was taken a step further. It really gave more internal depth to them both, Peter in particular.A truely timeless story evolved into a truly timeless picture--a triumph!

805917,AQM2ADBR0TYSO,B0001HAISG,Sarah Schenkkan,"[7, 8]","Rarely has an adaptation from a classic childhood story been so seamless, visually stunning, and truly entertaining. Originally written as a novel by J.M Barrie in 1904, and then for the London stage soon after, the legend of The Boy Who Never Grew Up entered American mainstream with the 1953 animated Disney version, which, although popular, failed to accurately capture the at times dark subject matter of the original storyline. Now, in 2003, under the guidance of director P.J. Hogan, Peter Pan has been given a live-action cast, the advances of modern filmmaking, and an overall look that is remarkably refreshing to a much wider age range of watchers.Wendy Darling (Rachel Hurd-Wood) is a bright-eyed, and intelligent London girl who delights in telling captivating stories and sword fighting with her two younger brothers John and Michael (Harry Newell and Freddie Popplewell, respectively). But, one day, much to Wendy's dismay, her parents and aunt lay down an ultimatum: It has come time for her to grow up, and leave the nursery and her childhood behind. That night, after Mr. and Mrs. Darling leave for a party and the Darling children are all snug in their beds, a magical boy named Peter Pan enters through their open window and with the help of fairy dust and happy thoughts, whisks them away to Neverland, a magical paradise in which you never grow old, and all the characters from Wendy's stories come to life. From adventures with the pirates of the Jolly Roger, commanded by evil Captain Hook, to Indians and fairies, the delightful story comes to life once again on a grand scale.In the terms of performances, most of the young cast are first-time actors, virtual unknowns in the business until now. As Wendy, Rachel Hurd-Wood sparkles, and has an innocense and hidden strength of a heroine around her. As for Peter Pan, (this version is the first to use a boy in the role) the search for the right person spanned nearly three continents, and ended with the find of Jeremy Sumpter (known for his part in the thriller ""Frailty""), who is without a doubt, perfect for the role. With his perfectly tousled hair and devilish good looks, he has a spark of confidence, charm, and a cocky little smile, (and still manages to convey his wish for a mother) that completely captures the character of Peter Pan. Jason Isaacs, who plays both Mr. Darling and Captain Hook (following the stage tradition) is delightful in his range of talent in both characters; Mr. Darling is an awkward, stuttering man who cares deeply and sacrifices much for his family, and Captain Hook is a seductive menace who terrorizes Neverland. In this version, the fairy Tinkerbell is played by French actress Ludivine Sagnier, who is at times annoying, but overall an interesting and amusing approach to the role.One of the things that truly stands out in this Peter Pan is the visual effects and the sets. The Darling household and London itself are beautifully done, and Neverland is beyond words. From the cotton-candy esque clouds above and the dense jungles with the hideout of Peter Pan and the Lost Boys, to the menacing ticking crocodile hunting Captain Hook, ""Peter Pan"" never ceases to amaze, as well as in the realms of costumes and makeup.Sprinkled with humor, and with a crackling script, a brilliant director, and extremely wise choices in casting, sets and costuming, and visual effects, ""Peter Pan"" is one of the best movies of the year and will continue to delight audiences for years to come.",5,Come Away To Neverland...,1073088000,"01 3, 2004",2004,3495,"['Rarely', 'adaptation', 'classic', 'childhood', 'story', 'been', 'so', 'seamless', 'visually', 'stunning', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'Originally', 'written', 'novel', 'J.M', 'Barrie', '1904', 'then', 'London', 'stage', 'soon', 'legend', 'Boy', 'Who', 'Never', 'Grew', 'Up', 'entered', 'American', 'mainstream', '1953', 'animated', 'Disney', 'version', 'popular', 'failed', 'accurately', 'capture', 'times', 'dark', 'subject', 'matter', 'original', 'storyline', 'Now', '2003', 'guidance', 'director', 'P.J', 'Hogan', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'been', 'given', 'live-action', 'cast', 'advances', 'modern', 'filmmaking', 'overall', 'look', 'remarkably', 'refreshing', 'much', 'wider', 'age', 'range', 'watchers.Wendy', 'Darling', 'Rachel', 'Hurd-Wood', 'bright-eyed', 'intelligent', 'London', 'girl', 'who', 'telling', 'captivating', 'stories', 'sword', 'fighting', 'two', 'younger', 'brothers', 'John', 'Michael', 'Harry', 'Newell', 'Freddie', 'Popplewell', 'respectively', 'one', 'day', 'much', 'Wendy', 'dismay', 'parents', 'aunt', 'lay', 'down', 'ultimatum', 'come', 'time', 'grow', 'up', 'leave', 'nursery', 'childhood', 'behind', 'night', 'Mr.', 'Mrs', 'Darling', 'leave', 'party', 'Darling', 'children', 'are', 'snug', 'beds', 'magical', 'boy', 'named', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'enters', 'open', 'window', 'help', 'fairy', 'dust', 'happy', 'thoughts', 'whisks', 'away', 'Neverland', 'magical', 'paradise', 'never', 'grow', 'old', 'characters', 'Wendy', 'stories', 'come', 'life', 'adventures', 'pirates', 'Jolly', 'Roger', 'commanded', 'evil', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'Indians', 'fairies', 'delightful', 'story', 'life', 'once', 'again', 'grand', 'scale.In', 'terms', 'performances', 'most', 'young', 'cast', 'are', 'first-time', 'actors', 'virtual', 'unknowns', 'business', 'now', 'Wendy', 'Rachel', 'Hurd-Wood', 'sparkles', 'innocense', 'hidden', 'strength', 'heroine', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'version', 'first', 'use', 'boy', 'role', 'search', 'right', 'person', 'spanned', 'nearly', 'three', 'continents', 'ended', 'find', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', 'known', 'part', 'thriller', 'Frailty', 'who', 'doubt', 'perfect', 'role', 'perfectly', 'tousled', 'hair', 'devilish', 'good', 'looks', 'spark', 'confidence', 'charm', 'cocky', 'little', 'smile', 'still', 'convey', 'wish', 'mother', 'completely', 'character', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'who', 'Mr', 'Darling', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'following', 'stage', 'tradition', 'delightful', 'range', 'talent', 'characters', 'Mr', 'Darling', 'awkward', 'stuttering', 'man', 'who', 'deeply', 'sacrifices', 'much', 'family', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'seductive', 'menace', 'who', 'Neverland', 'version', 'fairy', 'Tinkerbell', 'played', 'French', 'actress', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'who', 'times', 'annoying', 'interesting', 'amusing', 'approach', 'role.One', 'things', 'truly', 'out', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'visual', 'effects', 'sets', 'Darling', 'household', 'London', 'are', 'beautifully', 'done', 'Neverland', 'words', 'cotton-candy', 'esque', 'clouds', 'dense', 'hideout', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'menacing', 'ticking', 'crocodile', 'hunting', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'never', 'amaze', 'as', 'well', 'realms', 'costumes', 'makeup.Sprinkled', 'humor', 'crackling', 'script', 'brilliant', 'director', 'extremely', 'wise', 'choices', 'casting', 'sets', 'costuming', 'visual', 'effects', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'year', 'will', 'continue', 'delight', 'audiences', 'years', 'come']",N/A

805919,AIBRTGBN07D6A,B0001HAISG,Scott,"[0, 0]","I was looking forward to seeing this film, as I love the story of Peter Pan, but this version just didn't work for me.First of all, while staying true to Barrie's original story, the first 30 minutes almost appeared to be a remake of Spielberg's ""Hook"" than a novelization of the story. Even the music sounded similar to John Williams' 1991 score. I found myself immediately disliking the actor who portrayed Pan, and most especially, his horrible grin that he felt the need to show every 30 seconds. I wouldn't say he was a bad actor, but he definitely was guilty of overacting during MANY instances of this film, and he just wasn't a very likeable kid in general. The only actor who I disliked more is Ludivine Sagnier as Tinkerbell. I really wish they would have killed her off in the first few minutes because she became VERY annoying. She is a fairly odd-looking person, which I guess fairies are supposed to be, but if anyone on this film was guilty of overacting it's definitely her. All of her ridiculous facial expressions were just plain annoying rather than cute. I really hated seeing her onscreen, and I didn't buy her love for Pan like I did with Julia Roberts in ""Hook."" She didn't seem to have any remorse about trying to have Wendy killed, so it was hard to like this character.The film also contains some ridiculous action sequences that came off looking absurd. At one point there are two children riding on the back of a dog, while lying on their backs. In another, a child is flipped through the air and looks like he's doing cartwheels in space or something. In the opening scene, Pan is trying to catch his shadow in Wendy's room, and breaks or knocks over half of the furniture in his attempt. 10 minutes later, and after the room is destroyed, we're shown that Wendy's brothers are in the same room asleep! I don't know if they were on drugs or what but there's no way they could have slept through that.Cinematography on this film is excellent however. The film makes an excellent audio and video transfer to disc. This is one of the most phenomenal visual representations I've seen of a movie on home video and the colors really stand out, especially during the flight to Neverland.The extras are where the DVD falls flat. No audio commentary, which I feel really would have been nice for such a fantastically visually represented film. Instead, there are about 25 very short video featurettes, averaging 1-2 minutes in length. While interesting, they're all just crammed in there, with no real organization. Some featurettes are organized under the ""Captain Hook"" or ""Neverland Forest"" section, but then have nothing really to do with these and are basically just a bunch of behind the scenes clips. I think they definitely should have spent some more time with this and organized 5 or 6 decent featurettes in a cohesive manner rather than throw a bunch of small clips on there to make it look like there were more extras.Overall, I wouldn't say this is a bad movie, and most likely it will be enjoyed by a younger audience. However, it failed to catch my attention as an adult, and it seems like this is something that could have been accomplished with a few small changes and different casting decisions. The original DVD release presents a beautiful transfer of the film, but if you really enjoyed this movie, I'd lobby for a better edition than the one they currently have out.",2,I really disliked this version of the Pan story,1097280000,"10 9, 2004",2004,3409,"['was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'film', 'love', 'story', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'version', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'me.First', 'staying', 'true', 'Barrie', 'original', 'story', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'almost', 'appeared', 'be', 'remake', 'Spielberg', 'Hook', 'novelization', 'story', 'Even', 'music', 'sounded', 'similar', 'John', 'Williams', '1991', 'score', 'found', 'immediately', 'disliking', 'actor', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Pan', 'most', 'especially', 'horrible', 'grin', 'felt', 'need', 'show', '30', 'seconds', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'bad', 'actor', 'definitely', 'was', 'guilty', 'overacting', 'MANY', 'instances', 'film', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'likeable', 'kid', 'general', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'disliked', 'more', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'Tinkerbell', 'really', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'off', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'became', 'VERY', 'annoying', 'fairly', 'odd-looking', 'person', 'guess', 'fairies', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'anyone', 'film', 'was', 'guilty', 'overacting', 'definitely', 'ridiculous', 'facial', 'expressions', 'were', 'just', 'plain', 'annoying', 'rather', 'cute', 'really', 'hated', 'seeing', 'onscreen', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'love', 'Pan', 'did', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Hook', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'remorse', 'trying', 'have', 'Wendy', 'killed', 'was', 'hard', 'like', 'character.The', 'film', 'also', 'ridiculous', 'action', 'sequences', 'came', 'off', 'looking', 'absurd', 'one', 'point', 'are', 'two', 'children', 'riding', 'back', 'dog', 'lying', 'backs', 'child', 'flipped', 'air', 'doing', 'cartwheels', 'space', 'something', 'opening', 'scene', 'Pan', 'trying', 'catch', 'shadow', 'Wendy', 'room', 'breaks', 'knocks', 'half', 'furniture', 'attempt', '10', 'minutes', 'later', 'room', 'destroyed', ""'re"", 'shown', 'Wendy', 'brothers', 'are', 'same', 'room', 'asleep', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'were', 'drugs', 'what', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'slept', 'that.Cinematography', 'film', 'excellent', 'however', 'film', 'excellent', 'audio', 'video', 'transfer', 'disc', 'one', 'most', 'phenomenal', 'visual', 'representations', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'home', 'video', 'colors', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'especially', 'flight', 'Neverland.The', 'extras', 'are', 'where', 'DVD', 'flat', 'audio', 'commentary', 'feel', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'such', 'fantastically', 'visually', 'represented', 'film', 'Instead', 'are', '25', 'very', 'short', 'video', 'featurettes', 'averaging', '1-2', 'minutes', 'length', 'interesting', ""'re"", 'just', 'crammed', 'there', 'real', 'organization', 'featurettes', 'are', 'organized', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'Neverland', 'Forest', 'section', 'then', 'have', 'nothing', 'really', 'do', 'are', 'basically', 'just', 'bunch', 'scenes', 'clips', 'think', 'definitely', 'should', 'have', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'organized', '5', '6', 'decent', 'featurettes', 'cohesive', 'manner', 'rather', 'throw', 'bunch', 'small', 'clips', 'make', 'look', 'were', 'more', 'extras.Overall', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'bad', 'movie', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'younger', 'audience', 'However', 'failed', 'catch', 'attention', 'adult', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'accomplished', 'few', 'small', 'changes', 'different', 'casting', 'decisions', 'original', 'DVD', 'release', 'beautiful', 'transfer', 'film', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', ""'d"", 'lobby', 'better', 'edition', 'one', 'currently', 'have', 'out']",N/A
805920,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B0001HAISG,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 3]","When I first saw the trailer for P.J. Hogan's live-action version of ""Peter Pan,"" I wondered if Hollywood was just trying to cash in on a classic children's tale with a slap-dash, by-the-numbers studio concoction.  You know the kind - all sizzle, with little ""modern"" jokes of the moment thrown in, but essentially a grab for a quick buck at the expense of a famous title that will surely bring some parents and their kids into the multiplex.Then I saw the movie.  I was wrong.If P.J. Hogan and his team had any ulterior motive, it must have been to redeem J.M. Barrie's classic tale from the horrendous ""update"" it received with Steven Spielberg's magnum goof, ""Hook.""  This is a film adaptation that remains true to Barrie's story, which is only one of the great children's stories of all time.The Darling family lives in Victorian London, where Father toils as a banker and is afraid of his own shadow.  His glorious wife Mary appreciates his sacrifices, but his three children, Wendy, John, and Michael, do not.  For they are in that great pre-adolescent stage where they can thrill each other with stories of swordfights, pirates, and Napoleon, but are still ignorant of the horrors such things actually are.  To them, Father is a colossal bore who, worst of all, only wants them to grow up.Wendy (Rachel Hurd-Wood) is the eldest, and even though she is a budding young woman, she lives for adventure.  And so it is with a grateful smile and a flirtatious gleam that she greets Peter Pan, who flies into their room one night.  With a little coaxing and some fairy dust from a begrudging Tinkerbell, Wendy, John and Michael fly through the night sky to Neverland, leaving their mother to sit by the bedroom window waiting anxiously for their return.Once in Neverland, Peter introduces the Darlings to the Lost Boys, and Wendy becomes their mother.  All kinds of adventures ensue, including meeting Indians (much less stereotyped than in the Disney version), mermaids, and doing battle with fearsome pirates and their dastardly leader, Captain Hook (Jason Isaacs, doing dual duty as Mr. Darling).All adventures aside, ""Peter Pan"" is a paean to lost youth and how everybody must grow up . . . except Peter Pan.  Hogan and his team are faithful to the book in that Pan's perpetual adolescence is charming, but it is also just a bit sad.  Peter hates the idea of growing up, and he fears it, but he also has feelings for Wendy that he can't pursue if Wendy is allowed to grow up.  And Wendy has feelings for Peter, but she can't pursue them if he won't grow up.  This is complex stuff, but Barrie's story and Hogan's adaptation deal with it effortlessly.Astounding visual effects remind us that, as good as Pixar and other animators are these days, live action films still have an ""A"" game when it comes to visual thrills.  The crocodile that hungers after Hook is frightening, and Neverland has never looked so good.  Isaacs is also perfectly sinister as Hook, and Jeremy Sumpter does an excellent job as Peter.All in all, this movie goes on the top shelf of superb family films.  The only version of this story that can top it is sitting with your kids and reading them the stories of Peter Pan together.",5,"Whimsical yet sinister ""Peter Pan"" sets highwater mark for live action family films",1190592000,"09 24, 2007",2007,3206,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'P.J', 'Hogan', 'live-action', 'version', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'wondered', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'just', 'trying', 'cash', 'classic', 'children', 'tale', 'slap-dash', 'by-the-numbers', 'studio', 'concoction', 'know', 'kind', 'sizzle', 'little', 'modern', 'jokes', 'moment', 'thrown', 'essentially', 'grab', 'quick', 'buck', 'expense', 'famous', 'title', 'will', 'surely', 'bring', 'parents', 'kids', 'multiplex.Then', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'wrong.If', 'P.J', 'Hogan', 'team', 'had', 'ulterior', 'motive', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'redeem', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'classic', 'tale', 'horrendous', 'update', 'received', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'magnum', 'goof', 'Hook', 'film', 'adaptation', 'true', 'Barrie', 'story', 'only', 'one', 'great', 'children', 'stories', 'time.The', 'Darling', 'family', 'Victorian', 'London', 'where', 'Father', 'banker', 'afraid', 'own', 'shadow', 'glorious', 'wife', 'Mary', 'sacrifices', 'three', 'children', 'Wendy', 'John', 'Michael', 'do', 'not', 'are', 'great', 'pre-adolescent', 'stage', 'where', 'can', 'thrill', 'other', 'stories', 'swordfights', 'pirates', 'Napoleon', 'are', 'still', 'ignorant', 'horrors', 'such', 'things', 'actually', 'are', 'Father', 'colossal', 'bore', 'who', 'worst', 'only', 'grow', 'up.Wendy', 'Rachel', 'Hurd-Wood', 'eldest', 'even', 'budding', 'young', 'woman', 'adventure', 'grateful', 'smile', 'flirtatious', 'gleam', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'who', 'room', 'one', 'night', 'little', 'coaxing', 'fairy', 'dust', 'begrudging', 'Tinkerbell', 'Wendy', 'John', 'Michael', 'fly', 'night', 'sky', 'Neverland', 'leaving', 'mother', 'sit', 'bedroom', 'window', 'waiting', 'anxiously', 'return.Once', 'Neverland', 'Peter', 'Darlings', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'Wendy', 'mother', 'kinds', 'adventures', 'ensue', 'including', 'meeting', 'Indians', 'much', 'less', 'stereotyped', 'Disney', 'version', 'mermaids', 'doing', 'battle', 'fearsome', 'pirates', 'dastardly', 'leader', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'doing', 'dual', 'duty', 'Mr', 'Darling', '.All', 'adventures', 'aside', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'paean', 'lost', 'youth', 'how', 'everybody', 'must', 'grow', 'up', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Hogan', 'team', 'are', 'faithful', 'book', 'Pan', 'perpetual', 'adolescence', 'charming', 'also', 'just', 'bit', 'sad', 'Peter', 'idea', 'growing', 'up', 'also', 'feelings', 'Wendy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pursue', 'Wendy', 'allowed', 'grow', 'up', 'Wendy', 'feelings', 'Peter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pursue', 'wo', ""n't"", 'grow', 'up', 'complex', 'stuff', 'Barrie', 'story', 'Hogan', 'adaptation', 'deal', 'effortlessly.Astounding', 'visual', 'effects', 'remind', 'that', 'as', 'good', 'Pixar', 'other', 'animators', 'are', 'days', 'live', 'action', 'films', 'still', 'have', 'A', 'game', 'when', 'visual', 'thrills', 'crocodile', 'hungers', 'Hook', 'frightening', 'Neverland', 'never', 'looked', 'so', 'good', 'Isaacs', 'also', 'perfectly', 'sinister', 'Hook', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', 'excellent', 'job', 'Peter.All', 'movie', 'top', 'shelf', 'superb', 'family', 'films', 'only', 'version', 'story', 'can', 'top', 'sitting', 'kids', 'reading', 'stories', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'together']",N/A

I couldn't hear much of the quick, accented dialogue and didn't appreciate its faithfulness to Barrie's classic story.I just saw it for the second time on DVD and was blown away.  This is a VERY, VERY well-made motion picture.  In my second viewing, I saw levels of meaning in the story and nuances to the performances that I hadn't realized were there. PJ Hogan's direction is masterful.  He captures the magic of Neverland and the sadness of Peter's final decision in a way that has not been done before.The visual effects and cinematography (especially the use of color) are mesmerizing.  The acting by both the kids and adults is terrific.  Jeremy Sumpter has the pivotal role - the weight of the film rests on his shoulders.  That is a lot of pressure on a 12-year-old but Sumpter handles it admirably.  The British kids (Wendy, John, Michael(stand-out performance), and the Lost Boys) are so good in their roles that it seems almost effortless.  Jason Isaacs proves yet again why he is a coveted actor.PJ Hogan's &quot;Peter Pan&quot; is a classic in the making.  Young or old, this film is guaranteed to leave you with a great, big smile.One piece of advice: watch this one time with SUBTITLES on.

805932,A2FQAOD1W3O4GE,B0001HAISG,Theatre Fanatic,"[7, 23]","The problems with this version of 'Peter Pan' are numerous. First of all, the outrageously high usage of special effect and GGI take away the magic of J.M. Barrie's classic tale of the boy who won't grow up. Peter Pan is undoubtedly one of the greatest stories of all-time, but you would never know this from this horribly made version. I saw an interview with the director, in which he said this version is how J.M. Barrie would tell it if he had a big Hollywood budget and CGI to tell the story. Apparently, this director had no idea what he was talking about. The heart of the story should rely on the characters, their relationships and their development. Unfortunetly, the filmmakers thought the heart should be special effects, which completely ruins the great story.Overall, the acting is fine. All of the acting is done superbly, with two major standouts, one of which is good, the other which is bad. First, Jason is a marvel as Mr. Darling and Captain Hook. He plays the role originally and very well. A standout performance from a very fine veteran actor. However, the title character, Peter pan, is played very unevenly by Jeremy Sumpters. Sumpters did a very fine acting job in the very dark ""Frailty"", playing the son of Bill Paxton's character. I came expecting another great performance. Unfortunetly, the performance was scathing, im sorry to say. He looks the part, but needed much more emotion. His performance drags down the movie even more.All-in-all, Peter Pan can be an ok movie if you watch it expecting what it is, a big-budget Hollywood movie that is big on special effects, but little on heart and story. Stick to the classic Animated Disney version. I guarantee your children will enjoy it more.This movie could have been spectacular, but Hollywood always manages to mess up the most charming of tales. Who knew a telling of Peter Pan could be as bad as this? J.M. Barrie would be dissappointed.",3,More does not mean better,1073088000,"01 3, 2004",2004,1923,"['problems', 'version', ""'Peter"", 'Pan', 'are', 'numerous', 'First', 'all', 'outrageously', 'high', 'usage', 'special', 'effect', 'GGI', 'take', 'away', 'magic', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'classic', 'tale', 'boy', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'grow', 'up', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'undoubtedly', 'one', 'greatest', 'stories', 'all-time', 'would', 'never', 'know', 'horribly', 'made', 'version', 'saw', 'interview', 'director', 'said', 'version', 'how', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'would', 'tell', 'had', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'budget', 'CGI', 'tell', 'story', 'Apparently', 'director', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'talking', 'heart', 'story', 'should', 'rely', 'characters', 'relationships', 'development', 'Unfortunetly', 'filmmakers', 'thought', 'heart', 'should', 'be', 'special', 'effects', 'completely', 'great', 'story.Overall', 'acting', 'fine', 'acting', 'done', 'superbly', 'two', 'major', 'standouts', 'one', 'good', 'other', 'bad', 'First', 'Jason', 'marvel', 'Mr', 'Darling', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'role', 'originally', 'very', 'well', 'standout', 'performance', 'very', 'fine', 'veteran', 'actor', 'However', 'title', 'character', 'Peter', 'pan', 'played', 'very', 'unevenly', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpters', 'Sumpters', 'did', 'very', 'fine', 'acting', 'job', 'very', 'dark', 'Frailty', 'playing', 'son', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'character', 'came', 'expecting', 'great', 'performance', 'Unfortunetly', 'performance', 'was', 'scathing', 'im', 'sorry', 'say', 'part', 'needed', 'much', 'more', 'emotion', 'performance', 'down', 'movie', 'even', 'more.All-in-all', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'can', 'be', 'ok', 'movie', 'watch', 'expecting', 'what', 'big-budget', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'big', 'special', 'effects', 'little', 'heart', 'story', 'Stick', 'classic', 'Animated', 'Disney', 'version', 'guarantee', 'children', 'will', 'enjoy', 'more.This', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'spectacular', 'Hollywood', 'always', 'mess', 'up', 'most', 'charming', 'tales', 'Who', 'knew', 'telling', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'could', 'be', 'as', 'bad', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'would', 'be', 'dissappointed']",N/A

805934,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0001HAISG,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 6]","This newest ""Peter Pan,"" faithful to the original play/book, succeeds in being a very amusing adventure tale throughout.  That, you can be assured.  But what distinguishes this one from many others (possibly Disney's) is its serious undertone.  You should remember the fact that J. M. Barrie as a child lost his elder brother, and the sad memory is the basis of the story.  A boy lives young forever because he is not living here anymore.  This film does not miss that point, which is a great thing indeed.The famous story is basically the same as before, so there is no need to repeat it now.  Wendy meets Peter Pan (who is played by a male actor for the first time n English-speaking films) and goes to the Neverland.  Peter Pan is played by Jeremy Sumpter (""Frailty"") while Wendy by Rachel Hurd-Wood who auditioned for the role, with no previous acting experience.  Don't worry, they are so natural and engaging that you come to believe that the casting is not wrong.  And it is not.Adventure is all around, with fearsome Captain Hook (Jason Isaacs, the baddie in ""Patriot"") and his pirates.  Though they are treated in the slightly comic light, the truth is, they, especially the captain, are a bunch of cruel guys who really enjoy watching people walk on the board and dive into the sea, and the sword-fight scenes remind you of the fact.  They are exciting, and dangeroues at the same time, and when Captain kills, he kills as if it is nothing.Tinker Bell (lovely French Lodivine Sagner, regular of Francis Ozon) and other characters appear as they should, with superb acting.  The fine CGIs work to help their characters, helped by the power of imagination who use them even though some would prefer, understandably, Peter Pan flying with wire attached to his body.The greatest thing about this ""Peter Pan"" is, however, that it does not forget the flip side of being forever young.  At the end of the film, director P. J. Hogan (""Best Friends' Wedding"") gives us a touching moment -- touching because it shows sadness of being Peter Pan.  It's sweet all the same, but after all ""Peter Pan"" is about something we lost on the way to the adulthood.  And this film's conclusion never misses the point.Imagine the lush and lavish images of ""Moulin Rouge"" or Leo's ""Romeo & Juliet,"" and you get a picture of uniquely beautiful ""Peter Pan.""

805935,A1M2SDNJLRP2HX,B0001HAISG,"V. A McCoy ""Have book.  Will travel.""","[6, 7]","This movie has the most amazing look to it...like an animated Maxfield Parrish painting.  Neverland is full of lush, dense color, and peopled by all sorts of fantastical creatures, from the ever popular Tinkerbell to the beautiful, but feral mermaids.  The story stays pretty true to Barrie's original, with the emphasis on Wendy and a girl's sometimes frightening journey into womanhood.  And because of that emphasis, the tradition of having the same actor play Mr. Darling and Captain Hook has more resonance than ever.And what an actor.  Jason Isaacs is so good in each part that a viewer could mistake him for two different actors.  His Mr. Darling is a rather pathetically timid man, redeemed only by his obvious love for his wife and children.  His Captain Hook, on the other hand, encapsulates everything about adult males that gives Wendy pause as she contemplates growing up.  He's angry, vengeful, violent, even lustful.  But he's also attractive (Hook has amazing costumes and wigs, which provide a frame for Jason's wonderfully expressive eyes) and seductive and worldly, which gives him an appeal, even as he frightens her so badly.It's really a great performance, because, through it, you can see that Hook is a mirror-image of Peter Pan. A funhouse mirror, but a mirror, nonetheless. Peter refuses to grow up and move on, and Hook refuses to let go of his grudge and move on. Peter doesn't respect adults, and Hook resents youth. Both are attracted to Wendy, because she exudes her own kind of power...the power to make a young man yearn to be better and an older man yearn to be young. They are locked in a combat that they simply refuse to relinquish, because they're both consumed by their lust for the fight.All the performances in the movie range between very good and excellent.  Rachel Hurd-Wood is particularly charming and winsome as Wendy, and the Lost Boys are cute and funny.  Ludivine Sagnier is a very pretty, but also a very arch and malevolent Tinkerbell.  The only occasional weak link is Jeremy Sumpter as Peter Pan.  He has a great look for the role and the youthful exuberance to make a convincing Pan, but his line delivery sometimes slips from cocky into smarmy, and it makes him a slightly less attractive figure.Still, there is so much good about this movie--Jason, Rachel, the magnificent setpieces, and the attention to even the smallest detail, not to mention the classic story--that I gave it 5 stars.  The extras on the DVD are very nice, as well.  I recommend especially ""Through the Eyes of Captain Hook"", which is comprised of footage that Jason Isaacs shot on set, and the feature about the mermaids, which shows how much work went into creating a scene that lasted only a few seconds on-screen.",5,A Truly Beautiful Piece of Filmmaking,1149292800,"06 3, 2006",2006,2744,"['movie', 'most', 'amazing', 'look', 'animated', 'Maxfield', 'Parrish', 'painting', 'Neverland', 'full', 'lush', 'dense', 'color', 'peopled', 'sorts', 'fantastical', 'creatures', 'ever', 'popular', 'Tinkerbell', 'beautiful', 'feral', 'mermaids', 'story', 'pretty', 'true', 'Barrie', 'original', 'emphasis', 'Wendy', 'girl', 'sometimes', 'frightening', 'journey', 'womanhood', 'emphasis', 'tradition', 'having', 'same', 'actor', 'play', 'Mr', 'Darling', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'more', 'resonance', 'ever.And', 'what', 'actor', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'so', 'good', 'part', 'viewer', 'could', 'mistake', 'two', 'different', 'actors', 'Mr', 'Darling', 'rather', 'pathetically', 'timid', 'man', 'redeemed', 'only', 'obvious', 'love', 'wife', 'children', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'other', 'hand', 'everything', 'adult', 'males', 'Wendy', 'pause', 'growing', 'up', 'angry', 'vengeful', 'violent', 'even', 'lustful', 'also', 'attractive', 'Hook', 'amazing', 'costumes', 'wigs', 'provide', 'frame', 'Jason', 'wonderfully', 'expressive', 'eyes', 'seductive', 'worldly', 'appeal', 'even', 'so', 'badly.It', 'really', 'great', 'performance', 'can', 'see', 'Hook', 'mirror-image', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'A', 'funhouse', 'mirror', 'mirror', 'nonetheless', 'Peter', 'grow', 'up', 'move', 'Hook', 'let', 'go', 'grudge', 'move', 'Peter', ""n't"", 'respect', 'adults', 'Hook', 'resents', 'youth', 'are', 'attracted', 'Wendy', 'own', 'kind', 'power', 'power', 'make', 'young', 'man', 'yearn', 'be', 'better', 'older', 'man', 'yearn', 'be', 'young', 'are', 'locked', 'combat', 'simply', 'refuse', 'relinquish', ""'re"", 'consumed', 'lust', 'fight.All', 'performances', 'movie', 'range', 'very', 'good', 'excellent', 'Rachel', 'Hurd-Wood', 'particularly', 'charming', 'winsome', 'Wendy', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'are', 'cute', 'funny', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'very', 'pretty', 'also', 'very', 'arch', 'malevolent', 'Tinkerbell', 'only', 'occasional', 'weak', 'link', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'great', 'look', 'role', 'youthful', 'exuberance', 'make', 'convincing', 'Pan', 'line', 'delivery', 'sometimes', 'cocky', 'smarmy', 'slightly', 'less', 'attractive', 'figure.Still', 'so', 'much', 'good', 'movie', 'Jason', 'Rachel', 'magnificent', 'setpieces', 'attention', 'even', 'smallest', 'detail', 'not', 'mention', 'classic', 'story', 'gave', '5', 'stars', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'very', 'nice', 'well', 'recommend', 'especially', 'Eyes', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'comprised', 'footage', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'shot', 'set', 'feature', 'mermaids', 'how', 'much', 'work', 'went', 'creating', 'scene', 'lasted', 'only', 'few', 'seconds', 'on-screen']",N/A
805936,A38TC59GM2WW1X,B0001HAISG,"Victor Chen ""Messerschmitts""","[0, 2]","&quot;Peter Pan&quot; is such a great movie on so many levels that I don't even know where to begin!  This film is no doubt director P.J. Hogan's crowning masterpiece.After years of being portrayed variously by grown women, cartoon characters, and an aging Robin Williams, Peter Pan finally reclaims his youthful boyishness in this first, and perhaps most faithful rendition of the classic story.  The casting is superb from top to bottom.  Unlike other versions, Hogan doesn't shy away at using young, talented actors and thus refuses to compromise realism.  Jeremy Sumpter is fitting and delightful as the title role.  However, it is the beautiful Rachel Hurd-Wood (whose name doesn't even appear on the DVD jacket!  What a travesty!)  who completely steals the show, and stole my heart!  :-)  Possibly the most gorgeous thing ever to walk the earth with her impossibly adorable eyes, the precocious Hurd-Wood combines her physical beauty with incredible depth in her acting.  Her chemistry with fellow young actor Jeremy crackles with unusual intensity for ones so young.This version of the Peter Pan story includes a sweet, adorable romance between Wendy and Peter that is the real centrepiece of the film.  Hogan doesn't sell us short, nor does he shy away at portraying young love in a positive light, in all its sweet, innocent glory.  There's nothing to be ashamed of here; Hogan chooses to acknowledge that 13 year-olds fall in love too.  The &quot;fairy mid-air dance&quot; between Wendy and Peter is one of the sweetest and most romantic scenes in recent cinematic history.  And the final &quot;thimble&quot;!  Wow!  I won't ruin it for you guys.  :)  Let's just say, the true power of love is unleashed to save the day.  And none of it would have worked if not for the genuine chemistry between the two young leads, whom I am told are good friends in real life.  (Jeremy has expressed romantic interest in Rachel, but unfortunately it is not reciprocated)Jason Isaacs must also be given special mention for is phenomenal performance as the one and only Captain James Hook, AND Wendy's father!  I couldn't tell until someone told me; wow!  Now THAT's acting!  Isaac gives probably the finest portrayal of Hook ever, AT LEAST on par with (if not surpassing) Dustin Hoffman's also fine performance.  Isaacs gives Hook a level of emotional depth that I did not expect.  Indeed we find it difficult not to empathise with the lonely, emotionally scarred captain, and can't help but wonder what skeletons hide in the closet of his past.However, I must note that the greatest thing about this film is also its biggest problem;  whether purposely or unwittingly, Hogan has ended up making a version of Peter Pan whose target audience are adults.  The film is much too nuanced, layered, and complex to be fully enjoyed by children.  And it's much too serious.  For the first time, the irony of Peter Pan's existence is explored.  Pan's greatest gift is simultaneously his eternal curse; he cannot grow up, and thus he cannot receive his would-be girlfriend's love, nor can he live a full life.  As Wendy said &quot;You say you don't feel, but I think that is your biggest pretend&quot;.  This complexity to Peter's character is fully exploited by the writers (and Hook) in the final battle between Hook and Peter.  Even though Peter technically  wins (through the triumph of love ;-), in a brilliant twist), we see that in the end, both Peter and Hook are essentially tragic characters, trapped in a similar curse.  And, if this really had been a dark parody of the classic fairy tale for adults, I would suggest that the film should have ended with Peter lying on the deck of the Jolly Roger, exhausted and defeated not by Hook's sword, but by the unbearable truth of his words; this is how Peter Pan finally dies.Another level of complexity lies in the fact that Jason Isaacs plays both Wendy's father and Hook.  One can interpet this entire adventure as Wendy's own imagination.The special effects of the film must also be given a mention; they are gorgeous and superbly done.  Hogan has a distinctive style that beautifully gives live-action film a fantasy, almost cartoonish feel without sacrificing the realism and intellectual undertones of the movie.  The mermaids were my favourite.  Our familiar flippered friends are given a sinister, otherworldly look.  Tinkerbell is also very well done, played by the delightfully expressive French actress Ludivine Sagnier.Alas, this is still technically a children's movie, and everyone ends smiling (except Hook, of course).  Children will indeed enjoy this movie, but in the words of Dr. Frink from &quot;the Simpsons&quot;, &quot;You won't enjoy it on NEARLY as many levels as I will!&quot;  &quot;Peter Pan&quot; is a multilayered and complex treat of social psychology and anthropology.  It is a very mature and philosophically rich movie.  It can be enjoyed as a fantasy, a coming-of-age story, a very sweet romance, and/or an unapologetic and fearless analysis of Peter Pan's hidden, background themes.  This movie will not disappoint the discerning viewer.",5,A spectacular film and a wondrous achievement,1086048000,"06 1, 2004",2004,5115,"['quot', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'quot', 'such', 'great', 'movie',

I may still dislike Tinkerbell but in this film version of the story, I began to understand why she is important and, in the end, she is a genuinely a likable character.Before I watched this movie, I never felt the urge to read the classic children's book, afraid I may be disappointed by the similiarity it might have to the Disney version.  But now this terrific film has made me change my mind.  Jason Isaacs, Jeremy Sumpter, and Rachel Hurd-Wood are all excellent at portraying the various dimensions of their characters, allowing the audience to truly understand their state of minds and why they are the way they are.Overall, it is truly enjoyable and I can't wait to one day share this film with my children.",5,The best film presentation of Peter Pan,1086652800,"06 8, 2004",2004,859,"['have', 'grown', 'up', 'Disney', 'version', 'Peter', 'pan', 'life', 'was', 'always', 'dissatisfied', 'even', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'fully', 'realize', 'may', 'still', 'dislike', 'Tinkerbell', 'film', 'version', 'story', 'began', 'understand', 'why', 'important', 'end', 'genuinely', 'likable', 'character.Before', 'watched', 'movie', 'never', 'felt', 'urge', 'read', 'classic', 'children', 'book', 'afraid', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'similiarity', 'might', 'have', 'Disney', 'version', 'now', 'terrific', 'film', 'made', 'change', 'mind', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', 'Rachel', 'Hurd-Wood', 'are', 'excellent', 'portraying', 'various', 'dimensions', 'characters', 'allowing', 'audience', 'truly', 'understand', 'state', 'minds', 'why', 'are', 'way', 'are.Overall', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'one', 'day', 'share', 'film', 'children']",N/A

And this movie did NOT mess up.  It was right on target.  It was entertaining for all ages.  It had action.  It was funny.  The special effects were updated a lot since the last Peter Pan movie was made.  They were very good, although they looked like something a kid would imagine (and that was the point).  I was sort of suprized at all of the pirates that got killed at the end of the movie, but they were bad anyway!  The only problem with this movie, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars, is that is dragged out way too much.  Even the action scenes seemed to go by very slowly, and slower romance scenes took forever.  And it wasn't just me saying this either.

As Peter, Jeremy Sumpter has the facial features to be cheekily good-looking without becoming too cutesy, and his performance strikes a nice balance between charm and stubbornness.The special effects belong to the eighties -- I got the impression they threw away the budget on the crocodile and only later remembered they had other setpieces to fund -- but the whole thing is generally good fun, with enjoyable characterizations and a delightfully old-fashioned feel, even if it sometimes comes across as a little twee.The poignancy with which the themes of childhood and growing up are dealt with gives it the edge over other versions I have seen, including Disney's memorable 1953 animation.",4,Fairy-tale adaptation ultimately succeeds,1094860800,"09 11, 2004",2004,1330,"['Ultimately', 'PJ', 'Hogan', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'success.There', 'one', 'patch', 'hour', 'shortly', 'arrival', 'Neverland', 'when', 'film', 'not', 'quite', 'happy', 'far', 'too', 'cute', 'saccharine', 'own', 'good', 'makers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'up', 'mind', ""'re"", 'pitching', 'jolly', 'fun', 'old-fashioned', 'entertainment', 'run-of-the-mill', 'kiddies', 'blockbuster', 'thankfully', 'things', 'improve', 'film', 'moves', 'suitable', 'pace', 'thrilling', 'climax.Jason', 'Isaacs', 'excellent', 'form', 'Mr', 'Darling', 'dastardly', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'British', 'comedy', 'stalwart', 'Richard', 'Briers', 'Smee', 'Peter', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', 'facial', 'features', 'be', 'cheekily', 'good-looking', 'becoming', 'too', 'cutesy', 'performance', 'nice', 'balance', 'charm', 'stubbornness.The', 'special', 'effects', 'belong', 'eighties', 'got', 'impression', 'threw', 'away', 'budget', 'crocodile', 'only', 'later', 'remembered', 'had', 'other', 'setpieces', 'fund', 'whole', 'thing', 'generally', 'good', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'characterizations', 'delightfully', 'old-fashioned', 'feel', 'even', 'little', 'twee.The', 'poignancy', 'themes', 'childhood', 'growing', 'up', 'are', 'dealt', 'edge', 'other', 'versions', 'have', 'seen', 'including', 'Disney', 'memorable', '1953', 'animation']",N/A

The effects too are really spectacular, and brought the magical tale to life.The star performance is by the actor who portrays Peter Pan, as played by Jeremy Sumpter. Sumpter has this naturally cheeky and playful look, yet he can also convey vulnerability when the scene warrants it. Rachel Hurd-Wood is convincing as Wendy, and Jason Isaacs is suitably wicked in his role as the evil Captain Hook, though he also plays Mr. Darling (Wendy's dad).
