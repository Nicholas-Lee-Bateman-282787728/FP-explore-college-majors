It's one of those must-see films that you'll probably never want to watch again after you have seen it. Clive Owen is gorgeous. The acting is superb. Makes you want to go back in time and beat the heck out of every Nazi that ever was. The film is a reminder that the Nazis didn't just try to annihilate Jewish people.,4,Beautiful and sad.

I will just say that this English/Japanese production is one of the most powerful films I have seen - the casting is wonderful - Clive Owen is a revelation and Lothaire Bluteau - the French Canadian actor who starred in Jesus of Montreal gives a heart rending performance.

Although not being a documentary, it is a ""could be"" movie. At the begining of the film we are in a wild club with fancy and trendy people flirts, watch ""modern"" performances and enjoy and industrial envoiromen. It reproduces the mood of early 30's Berlin, were ""gay life"" was active in clubs like EL DORADO, bistros and even gay and lesbian magazines like Die Freundschaft. Life is a party for Max, the main character. However, Nazi politics, which includes homosexuals witch-hunt, is the end of that golden era. It is not mentioned in the film, but although that active gay life, there were a law against homosexuality (Paragraph 173). That is a reminder for us now, it is not only important to have social tolerance or acceptance, but to be sure laws are changed for not raising among the dead and haunt us in the most unexpected moment. Max meeting a self-confident guy at a concentration camp will make him understand the differences between sex and love. Although being a similar theme to A LOVE TO HIDE, the French film is more oriented on external situations of being gay in France, focusing on police activity, concentration camps abuses and even mentioning castration, hormones experiments and cerebral interventions with homosexuals.

152836,A8540ROXP4VOI,0792845226,David M. Glasgow,"[0, 0]","In today's world of multi-million-dollar-budget films it's easy to develop high expectations.  We're accustomed now to realities whose sights and  sounds have been tweaked by talent and technology to perfection--we now see  exactly what the director hoped we would, rather than settling for  less-impressive, but more-thoughtful, innuendos and visual metaphors.So  in some ways it's refreshing to partake of a lower-budget production like  Bent.  The world of staged theatre is a simpler, more intellectual one than  that of cinema, and too often an exquisitely crafted stage play is  &quot;technologized&quot; beyond recognition when it is shot for the  screen.  But, no doubt because playwright Martin Sherman himself adapted  the screenplay, Bent still feels as nakedly thoughtful as the best  small-cast stage dramas.The story centers on the relationship between  Max, a gay jew in Hitler's Germany, and Horst, whose character is  introduced in such a way that we're half-surprised to realize later in the  film that he's the same person we met on the train.  But that is the beauty  of the playwright's craft: in art, as in life, people we meet as  &quot;passing strangers&quot; can come to touch us profoundly.The sets  Mathias chooses as backdrops for the story are far from accurate  historically, but they are perfectly chosen to support the mood of the  film--Max and Horst, like the star-crossed lovers in a Shakespeare tragedy,  are lonely pawns to forces much larger than they.  Indeed, Bent offers the  most tragically romantic scenes of any film I've seen.  Two lovers, brought  together by the same forces that keep them forever apart, survive on  fantasy and suggestion in a world where life, in so many ways, has no  meaning.Bent is not a &quot;feel-good&quot; movie.

152839,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,0792845226,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","It took twenty years to get Martin Sherman's notorious, highly controversial play filmed--and one has to wonder why, given the result, they bothered.The story remains essentially the same.  Set in 1930s Germany, the play follows the lives of three gay men. Max (Clive Owen) is wildly promiscuous, and much to the annoyance of his lover Rudy (Brian Webber) brings home an SA  solider for the night. But it has been a bad choice: Hitler has ordered the Night of Long Knives, a purge of the SA; on the morning after, SS troops burst into the apartment and execute the SA solider. Now exposed as homosexual in a regime that has very suddenly turned against homosexuals, Max and Rudy go on the run, desperately seeking aid from friends and family and finding none. They are eventually picked up and Rudy is beaten to death. Max knows that homosexuals are considered the lowest of the low in the concentration camps. He steadfastly denies that he is homosexual and, through a genuinely horrible act, convinces his tormentors to give him a Jewish star instead of a homosexual pink triangle.Once at the camp, Max becomes very guardedly friendly with Horst (Lothaire Bluteau), a homosexual who wears a pink triangle who is treated viciously by Nazis and other prisoners alike. Over time Max, who has never been very deeply in love with anyone including the now-dead Rudy, falls in love with Horst--but they dare not make eye contact, dare not touch, can only speak without moving their lips. Horst upbraids Max for wearing the Jewish star instead of the homosexual pink triangle, but over time Max wins him over, and they begin an odd sort of affair, having sex with each other in their minds and through carefully uttered words. But this is at the height of the Nazi's dark powers. There will be no happy ending for anyone.On stage, BENT is incredibly violent and uses such sexually blunt language that most audiences find both head-spinning.  On screen, the effect is very much different because we've seen it on screen so many times before.  And director Sean Mathias takes a most odd view of the world in which BENT occurs: it isn't anything like Berlin, or Germany, or indeed anywhere else.  The opening sequence is famous for its inclusion of Mick Jagger as drag queen Greta--and while Jagger isn't actually bad, the gay bar is less gay than it is surreal in a silly sort of way, and less a bar than a bombed-out building people to squirm around against.  When were allowed to see the city itself, it too is broken down, beaten up, something that was hardly the case at the time, and more strangely still there seems to be only about twenty-four people living in it.  Perhaps the ultimate insult is in the way the film depicts the concentration camp; you wouldn't want to go there, but it is comparatively tame (SOPHIE'S CHOICE and SHINDLER'S LIST this isn't), and again there only seem to be about twenty-four people there.  Max and Horst move rocks.  They talk.  They move some rocks.  They talk some more.On stage this is dark, powerful stuff.  On screen, well, it looks like it should have been left on the stage.  No bonuses excepting a trailer.  Three stars for the performances, and that's very generous.

152840,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,0792845226,Gregor von Kallahann,"[42, 47]","When I first started reading film criticism, while still in my teens, I remember being, at first, surprised that and then understanding of why many critics were wary of films adapted from stage plays.  At first blush, film seems to be a logical extension of the stage, but then when you take into account the unique aspects of both genres, you realize that they are, in many ways, worlds apart.  Despite the cinema's (ever increasing) ability to create astonishing special effects, it is the more naturalistic of the two genres.  A scene that takes place in the great outdoors can be shot in the great outdoors. With the camera focusing in for close-ups, actors don't have to rely on grand gestures or declamatory oration to convey their meaning.The standard term among movie makers and their critics for the changes that have to be made to successfully adapt a stage play to the cinema is ""opening it up.""  You have to get it off the stage and into the world.  Sometimes it works, and sometimes they fall flat.  But the cinematic beast is hungry for narrative and stage plays (along with novels, short stories, lesser known foreign films, and nowadays old comic strips and TV shows) continue to provide it fodder.Everything I knew about the play BENT did not make it seem promising for film adaptation.  I was wrong.  Although I've never seen the stage version, one can almost envision it from watching the film.  One can also pretty much guess what changes have been made, where things have been embellished and what cinematic tricks have been thrown in to spice things us.  So that makes it pretty transparent, right?  And therefore not such a great film.Well, yes and no.  The film doesn't achieve actual greatness, I suppose.  But even though it's a bit stagey, perhaps, in some ways, it compensates brilliantly for it in other ways.  First off, the cinematography is  brilliant and no doubt brings a quite different perspective to the drama.  The acting is also top notch.  I had never seen Clive Owen in anything before--although judging from the reviews posted here, he has quite a fan base.  Deservedly so, I'd say based on his performance he turns in here.  His character, Max, makes the transition from callow sensualist to self-sacrificing hero believably--and in relatively few scenes.  Equally good is French-Canadian actor, Lothaire Bluteau, as Horst, Max's soul-mate and (platonic?) lover.  The scene in which they ""make love"" without touching is quietly powerful--and emblematic of the differences between the cinema and the stage discussed above.  Here the actors work with close-ups and with their voices, they cannot gesture because they're being watched.  Whatever the stage actors did in the equivalent scene had to be different--even if it was just as effective.  They were denied the close-ups that these two actors take great advantage of.The true test of a film's power is whether or not you'll be thinking about it the next day, or the next week.  BENT passes that test hands down.  It stays with you--and likely will for a long time.(PS--Just to follow up on a review posted below.  One reviewer didn't understand the relevance of the scene in the park with Ian McKellan.  I can understand the confusion, as the sound seemed unnecessarily muffled at this point in the film.  It is a bit sketchy, but it's fairly clear McKellan's character is Max's uncle, who while also gay, is closeted and, unlike Max himself, not estranged from their (apparently wealthy) family.  He offers Max forged papers, which the family has been able to obtain for him to facilitate his escape from Germany.  Max is,however, adamant that they also obtain papers for his lover as well, an early signal that he is not just the callow and selfish hedonist he seemed to be in the film's opening scenes--which makes his ultimate transformation by the film's end all the more plausible.)",4,The Movie's The Thing...,1070755200,"12 7, 2003",2003,3885,"['When', 'first', 'started', 'reading', 'film', 'criticism', 'still', 'teens', 'remember', 'being', 'first', 'surprised', 'then', 'understanding', 'why', 'many', 'critics', 'were', 'wary', 'films', 'adapted', 'stage', 'plays', 'first', 'blush', 'film', 'be', 'logical', 'extension', 'stage', 'then', 'when', 'take', 'account', 'unique', 'aspects', 'genres', 'realize', 'are', 'many', 'ways', 'worlds', 'apart', 'cinema', 'ever', 'increasing', 'ability', 'create', 'astonishing', 'special', 'effects', 'more', 'naturalistic', 'two', 'genres', 'scene', 'place', 'great', 'outdoors', 'can', 'be', 'shot', 'great', 'outdoors', 'camera', 'focusing', 'close-ups', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'rely', 'grand', 'gestures', 'declamatory', 'oration', 'convey', 'meaning.The', 'standard', 'term', 'movie', 'makers', 'critics', 'changes', 'have', 'be', 'made', 'successfully', 'adapt', 'stage', 'play', 'cinema', 'opening', 'up', 'have', 'get', 'off', 'stage', 'world', 'sometimes', 'fall', 'flat', 'cinematic', 'beast', 'hungry', 'narrative', 'stage', 'plays', 'novels', 'short', 'stories', 'lesser', 'known', 'foreign', 'films', 'nowadays', 'old', 'comic', 'strips', 'TV', 'shows', 'continue', 'provide', 'fodder.Everything', 'knew', 'play', 'BENT', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'seem', 'promising', 'film', 'adaptation', 'was', 'wrong', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'stage', 'version', 'one', 'can', 'almost', 'envision', 'watching', 'film', 'One', 'can', 'also', 'pretty', 'much', 'guess', 'what', 'changes', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'where', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'embellished', 'what', 'cinematic', 'tricks', 'have', 'been', 'thrown', 'spice', 'things', 'pretty', 'transparent', 'right', 'therefore', 'not', 'such', 'great', 'film.Well', 'yes', 'film', ""n't"", 'achieve', 'actual', 'greatness', 'suppose', 'even', 'bit', 'stagey', 'perhaps', 'ways', 'brilliantly', 'other', 'ways', 'First', 'cinematography', 'brilliant', 'doubt', 'quite', 'different', 'perspective', 'drama', 'acting', 'also', 'top', 'notch', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'anything', 'before', 'judging', 'reviews', 'posted', 'here', 'quite', 'fan', 'base', 'Deservedly', ""'d"", 'say', 'based', 'performance', 'here', 'character', 'Max', 'transition', 'callow', 'sensualist', 'self-sacrificing', 'hero', 'believably', 'relatively', 'few', 'scenes', 'Equally', 'good', 'French-Canadian', 'actor', 'Lothaire', 'Bluteau', 'Horst', 'Max', 'soul-mate', 'platonic', 'lover', 'scene', 'make', 'love', 'touching', 'quietly', 'powerful', 'emblematic', 'differences', 'cinema', 'stage', 'discussed', 'Here', 'actors', 'work', 'close-ups', 'voices', 'can', 'not', 'gesture', ""'re"", 'being', 'watched', 'stage', 'actors', 'did', 'equivalent', 'scene', 'had', 'be', 'different', 'even', 'was', 'just', 'effective', 'were', 'denied', 'close-ups', 'two', 'actors', 'take', 'great', 'advantage', 'of.The', 'true', 'test', 'film', 'power', 'not', ""'ll"", 'be', 'thinking', 'next', 'day', 'next', 'week', 'BENT', 'test', 'down', 'likely', 'will', 'long', 'time', 'PS', 'Just', 'follow', 'up', 'review', 'posted', 'One', 'reviewer', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'relevance', 'scene', 'park', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'can', 'understand', 'confusion', 'sound', 'seemed', 'unnecessarily', 'muffled', 'point', 'film', 'bit', 'sketchy', 'fairly', 'clear', 'McKellan', 'character', 'Max', 'uncle', 'who', 'also', 'gay', 'closeted', 'Max', 'not', 'estranged', 'apparently', 'wealthy', 'family', 'Max', 'forged', 'papers', 'family', 'been', 'able', 'obtain', 'facilitate', 'escape', 'Germany', 'Max', 'however', 'adamant', 'also', 'obtain', 'papers', 'lover', 'as', 'well', 'early', 'signal', 'not', 'just', 'callow', 'selfish', 'hedonist', 'seemed', 'be', 'film', 'opening', 'scenes', 'ultimate', 'transformation', 'film', 'end', 'more', 'plausible']",N/A
152841,AVQ9QH593HMWT,0792845226,"Jenny A. Baryaacov ""JBY""","[2, 2]","""Bent"" has a powerful story at its core, and two amazing performances. But the director obviously hasn't learned that less is more, and doesn't trust his audience to understand the story without banging it into their heads for them.The movie is somewhat schizophrenic, since it feels like two different movies strung together. The first movie, which I guess is mainly to put the story in context, is set in Berlin in the 30's, and consists of a lot of scenes in gay night clubs with lots of gorgeous men & women wearing not much and engaging in a great deal of anonymous sex. It is dominated by an absolutely dreadful performance by Mick Jagger, as a transvestite who looks a lot like my Aunt Gertie. It introduces Max and his lover, Rudy. This part of the movie goes on way too long. I am sure that the purpose is to provide a historical premise for the movie,  as well as contrast for the stark and terrifying life in Dachau which follows. However, the movie is only 104 minutes long, and a disproportionate amount of time (35 minutes)is spent getting everyone into place for the main plot. In addition, it felt like a lot of these choreographed scenes of orgies crossed the line from setting the stage for the plot to taking on a life of their own, detracting from the story that follows.This is really a shame, since the second movie, after Max and Rudy are arrested and put on a train for Dachau, is very compelling. But once, again, it feels like devices are stuck in with no good reason except, possibly to point out that you are watching a movie and not a play. For example, the train ride to Dachau is utterly harrowing. And yet the director intersperses these scenes with sepia prints of a train moving through countryside. I have no idea why he did this, however it seemed to me that the effect was (at least for this viewer) to distance the audience from the horrifying reality of the events in the train, as well as give it a melodramatic flair that was out of place.Once the action moves to Dachau, it does feel a bit like a stage play. But the drama that enfolds, a love story where neither lover can touch or often even look at one another, is very moving. There is a scene where Max and Horst (another prisoner in Dachau because of his homosexuality) make love without touching or looking at eachother. It feels like a risky scene for the actors, but that may contribute to its power, because it ends up being a convincing expression of love and even triumph over circumstances. In addition, in spite of the essential tragedy of the story, there are actually some very humorous moments.Without spoiling the movie, I am not sure how I feel about the last moments of the movie, and Max's actions. The events in the last scene feel inevitable, but nevertheless devastating. I am just not sure if Max's final acts are true to the character, as opposed to being a dramatic device to end the film. Unfortunately, the violin solo whining in the background did nothing to add to the emotional impact of the final scene.Clive Owen and Lothaire Bluteau give really tremendous, understated performances, and it is these performances, and some moments of great dialogue that makes this a film worth seeing.",3,Powerful story,1169078400,"01 18, 2007",2007,3211,"['Bent', 'powerful', 'story', 'core', 'two', 'amazing', 'performances', 'director', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'learned', 'less', 'more', ""n't"", 'trust', 'audience', 'understand', 'story', 'banging', 'heads', 'them.The', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'schizophrenic', 'two', 'different', 'movies', 'strung', 'together', 'first', 'movie', 'guess', 'mainly', 'put', 'story', 'context', 'set', 'Berlin', '30', 'lot', 'scenes', 'gay', 'night', 'clubs', 'lots', 'gorgeous', 'men', 'women', 'wearing', 'not', 'much', 'engaging', 'great', 'deal', 'anonymous', 'sex', 'dominated', 'absolutely', 'dreadful', 'performance', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'transvestite', 'who', 'lot', 'Aunt', 'Gertie', 'Max', 'lover', 'Rudy', 'part', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'am', 'sure', 'purpose', 'provide', 'historical', 'premise', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'contrast', 'stark', 'terrifying', 'life', 'Dachau', 'However', 'movie', 'only', '104', 'minutes', 'long', 'disproportionate', 'amount', 'time', '35', 'minutes', 'spent', 'getting', 'everyone', 'place', 'main', 'plot', 'addition', 'felt', 'lot', 'choreographed', 'scenes', 'orgies', 'crossed', 'line', 'setting', 'stage', 'plot', 'taking', 'life', 'own', 'detracting', 'story', 'follows.This', 'really', 'shame', 'second', 'movie', 'Max', 'Rudy', 'are', 'arrested', 'put', 'train', 'Dachau', 'very', 'compelling', 'once', 'again', 'devices', 'are', 'stuck', 'good', 'reason', 'possibly', 'point', 'out', 'are', 'watching', 'movie', 'not', 'play', 'example', 'train', 'ride', 'Dachau', 'utterly', 'harrowing', 'yet', 'director', 'scenes', 'sepia', 'prints', 'train', 'moving', 'countryside', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'did', 'however', 'seemed', 'effect', 'was', 'least', 'viewer', 'distance', 'audience', 'horrifying', 'reality', 'events', 'train', 'as', 'well', 'give', 'melodramatic', 'flair', 'was', 'place.Once', 'action', 'Dachau', 'feel', 'bit', 'stage', 'play', 'drama', 'love', 'story', 'where', 'lover', 'can', 'touch', 'often', 'even', 'look', 'one', 'very', 'moving', 'scene', 'where', 'Max', 'Horst', 'prisoner', 'Dachau', 'homosexuality', 'make', 'love', 'touching', 'looking', 'eachother', 'risky', 'scene', 'actors', 'may', 'contribute', 'power', 'up', 'being', 'convincing', 'expression', 'love', 'even', 'triumph', 'over', 'circumstances', 'addition', 'spite', 'essential', 'tragedy', 'story', 'are', 'actually', 'very', 'humorous', 'moments.Without', 'spoiling', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'feel', 'last', 'moments', 'movie', 'Max', 'actions', 'events', 'last', 'scene', 'feel', 'inevitable', 'nevertheless', 'devastating', 'am', 'just', 'not', 'sure', 'Max', 'final', 'acts', 'are', 'true', 'character', 'opposed', 'being', 'dramatic', 'device', 'end', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'violin', 'solo', 'whining', 'background', 'did', 'nothing', 'add', 'emotional', 'impact', 'final', 'scene.Clive', 'Owen', 'Lothaire', 'Bluteau', 'give', 'really', 'tremendous', 'understated', 'performances', 'performances', 'moments', 'great', 'dialogue', 'film', 'seeing']",N/A
152842,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,0792845226,JGC,"[52, 55]","BENT has an all-star cast that stars British actor (""Derailed"" star), Clive Owen as the movie's resident hero and lost soul, Max. Music legend, Mick Jagger has a small part playing a female impersonator who disappears after the first 15 minutes. Lothaire Bluteau plays sentimental Horst, and Brian Webber is poor, innocent Rudy.Even though the movie is ten years old I never heard of it until last week. It's still an awesome movie because it tells such a powerful story. BENT tells the tragic tale of two homosexual men in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany during the 30's. When I first heard of this movie I thought that BENT was a weird title. But I think that after watching it anyone will agree that it's a very appropriate title.The first 30 minutes of the movie are somewhat slow-moving. It shows Berlin before Nazi Germany took over. As you know, during this time in Berlin men danced with men and women danced with women and all were free to be happy and gay. At first sight, it's almost reminiscent of the classic film, ""Grand Hotel."" And I soon wished that there would be some dialogue and something interesting to watch because it seemed like the beginning was really dragging on.Max was a foolish man to bring home another man that he met the night before, Wolf (played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.)  Sadly, when the Nazis break in, Wolf's demise is quick and brutal.Max and Rudy try to get out of Germany because they are both homosexual men living in a country that wants them treated in the most inhumane ways possible. In the concentration camps homosexual men are the very, very lowest of the low. So, Max and Rudy have to sleep in the woods, or as Rudy calls it, the ""jungle"" while they race for a way out of Germany. As Rudy embraces Max to profess his love the Nazis come running towards them.Both men are put on a train heading to a concentration camp. I don't want to give too much away but the train scenes are among the most vulgar and hardest to watch. I can't imagine that hell is any worse than what my gay brothers and sisters had to go through during the Holocaust. I think this movie was originally rated NC-17, and although I am very grateful that this story is being told I am also grateful that I only watched the cable TV version (which was still sad enough.)Max has to tell the Gestapo that Rudy is not his friend (i. e. lover); for his own (temporary) safety. Clive Owen gave an especially momentous performance during the train scenes because it was obvious that he was trying to get Rudy out of his head (but could not.) Max first meets Horst on their ""train trip to purgatory"" and Horst tells him that he must not get close to anyone if he wants to survive in this place. Now I know why this picture is called BENT.At the concentration camp, Max bribed one of the guards so he could work with Horst. Their mundane job is to move huge boulders back and forth, all day. The only purpose of this task is to make them emotionally and physically weak.Even under such adverse conditions, Max and Horst fall in love. But they can never touch each other or even look at each other. They can never hold one another's hand or feel the other's breath. If one of the Nazis saw either man in even the most innocent intimate embrace or even having casual contact he would surely be dead.So, instead both men talk to each other. They have a love affair in their minds. My favorite parts are when Max and Horst were working alone and able to talk to each other. At least in their minds they could love each other and not be afraid of the consequences.Clive Owen's performance in this film was absolutely perfect. I am not an actor, but maybe it's easier for actors to act when they are surrounded with talent, and the rest of the cast was also flawless. Max totally reminded me of Ennis Del Mar. Both men had so much pent-up self-hate. However, Max's was much more fundamental, and twisted. It became evident that the abuse the Nazis inflected on Max's mind was just as brutal and barbaric as the physical corruption that they generously dished out. Clive Owen should've gotten an Oscar nod for his portrayal of Max. (I guess in 1997 it wasn't politically correct to give gay movies Oscars?)Why is BENT so tragic and sad? Because it is true. The movie's realism will haunt you for days (or even weeks.) The characters are fictional, but be assured it did happen. This movie reminded of a very powerful book, ""Behold A Pale Horse."" This was a book based on true events which also describes a gay love story during the Holocaust.Who do I recommend this movie to? Anyone. Not just the gay community, but to all of humanity. Anyone that has any feeling will bleed for these poor men: Wolf, Rudy, Max, Horst; and the thousands and thousands of homosexuals that were tortured and murdered for no other reason than for being born gay.",5,Crucified by the Gestapo,1175990400,"04 8, 2007",2007,4851,"['BENT', 'all-star', 'cast', 'British', 'actor', 'Derailed', 'star', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'movie', 'resident', 'hero', 'lost',

The subject is interesting, historical, true and tragic so films like this certainly need to be made but I'm reluctant to say that this is good.  Having said that I did  &quot;enjoy&quot; it, if that is the right word, and I do have it on video.Max is an open homosexual living in Berlin in the 1930s; not the wisest  of options considering that Hitler is around and has started his  persecution of homosexuals (we must not forget that it was not just the  Jews who were victims of his evil but homosexuals, gypsies, political  opponents and Slaves as well). Max lives with dancer Rudy with whom he is  in love but doesn't realise it until he is forced by the SS to murder him  brutally on a train on the way to a concentration camp.  On the Night of  the Long Knives, Max makes the fatal error of bedding a German soldier who  is wanted by the Gestapo. They break into his and Rudy's apartment, kill  the soldier and force Max and Rudy to go on the run and live like dogs in  the forest in constant fear of their lives. When they are eventually  betrayed and caught Max finds himself left to face the brutal horrors of a  concentration camp without Rudy.  But he is given life-saving words of  wisdom by fellow homosexual prisoner Horst, a nurse, who is better  acquainted with the vicious ways of the Nazis and becomes determined to  survive.  Having bonded they end up working together and eventually grow to  love eachother.  What is more extraordinary is that they learn how to make  love without actually touching.There are some very good and poignant  bits in this film and Lothaire Bluteau and Sir Ian MacKellan are very good  but somehow Clive Owen doesn't seem to fit completely and his performance  is very patchy.With regards to the style of the film it is evident that  it is a film adaptation of a play and so some bits, like in the beginning  with all the dancers, don't translate to the big screen all that well and  some of the symbolism is so desperate to be noticed that it feels  patronising to watch.As a play it would be very good indeed but as a  film it falls a bit flat on it's face.",3,Hmmmm....,961459200,"06 20, 2000",2000,2155,"[""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'film', 'subject', 'interesting', 'historical', 'true', 'tragic', 'so', 'films', 'certainly', 'need', 'be', 'made', ""'m"", 'reluctant', 'say', 'good', 'Having', 'said', 'did', 'quot', 'quot', 'right', 'word', 'do', 'have', 'video.Max', 'open', 'homosexual', 'living', 'Berlin', '1930s', 'not', 'wisest', 'options', 'considering', 'Hitler', 'around', 'started', 'persecution', 'homosexuals', 'must', 'not', 'forget', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'Jews', 'who', 'were', 'victims', 'evil', 'homosexuals', 'gypsies', 'political', 'opponents', 'Slaves', 'as', 'well', 'Max', 'dancer', 'Rudy', 'whom', 'love', ""n't"", 'realise', 'forced', 'SS', 'murder', 'brutally', 'train', 'way', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Night', 'Long', 'Knives', 'Max', 'fatal', 'error', 'bedding', 'German', 'soldier', 'who', 'wanted', 'Gestapo', 'break', 'Rudy', 'apartment', 'kill', 'soldier', 'force', 'Max', 'Rudy', 'go', 'run', 'live', 'dogs', 'forest', 'constant', 'fear', 'lives', 'When', 'are', 'eventually', 'betrayed', 'caught', 'Max', 'left', 'face', 'brutal', 'horrors', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Rudy', 'given', 'life-saving', 'words', 'wisdom', 'fellow', 'homosexual', 'prisoner', 'Horst', 'nurse', 'who', 'better', 'acquainted', 'vicious', 'ways', 'Nazis', 'becomes', 'determined', 'survive', 'Having', 'bonded', 'end', 'up', 'working', 'together', 'eventually', 'grow', 'love', 'eachother', 'What', 'more', 'extraordinary', 'learn', 'how', 'make', 'love', 'actually', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'poignant', 'bits', 'film', 'Lothaire', 'Bluteau', 'Sir', 'Ian', 'MacKellan', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'somehow', 'Clive', 'Owen', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'completely', 'performance', 'very', 'patchy.With', 'regards', 'style', 'film', 'evident', 'film', 'adaptation', 'play', 'so', 'bits', 'beginning', 'dancers', 'do', ""n't"", 'translate', 'big', 'screen', 'well', 'symbolism', 'so', 'desperate', 'be', 'noticed', 'patronising', 'watch.As', 'play', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'indeed', 'film', 'bit', 'flat', 'face']",N/A

Since the largest number of victims of Hitler's extermination  of non-Aryans were Jews, any minority persecution is doomed to be an  historical footnote. Hitler is probably still chuckling over this, being  one of the many ironies of his legacy. He would be rolling on the floor  about how, the destruction of the gas chambers before the camps were  liberated, feeds the denial of the historical revisionists. (The  reconstructions in Shoah, and TV's War and Rememberance are chilling). Of  course it is foolish to compare the suffering of one abstractive group to  another (you say anti-semitism/I say homophobia/let's call the whole thing  off), but the tragedy of the Jews is so overwhelming that a divisiveness of  thinking is impossible to avoid for any of the other undesirables in the  Third Reich - be they political dissidents, Catholics, the mentally ill,  the chronically unemployed, criminals, artists, intellectuals, Slavs,  Jehovah's Witnesses, clergymen, Gypsies, or homosexuals. (My apologies for  anyone overlooked).  This point is subtlely made in the film of Bent, along  with details that redeem what is otherwise a disappointing experience. We  see how the German children played and the adults picnicked at the site of  Dachau. Just imagine the circus around Auschwitz, where the smell of  burning flesh hung in the air and the flames of the ovens rose high into  the sky. These observations make a mockery of the claims that the protected  knew nothing of the camps. We also get a tantalising glimpse of Ernst  Roehm, the gay leader of the SA, whose murder on the Night of the Long  Knives, begins the film. The stylised direction by Sean Mathias is  misguided because it works against the material, robbing it of any truth,  though I can't deny the eroticism of the opening decadence. I never  believed that these actors or the locations were German since Berlin and  Dachau are specified in the dialogue. (In fact, Roehm and his soldiers were  stationed in Lake Wiessee, near Munich, on the night). Considering that  Martin Sherman wrote the play for Ian McKellen and that he played the lead  in it's debut staging, his negligible appearance here is practically an  insult. The set for Dachau, while an interesting choice to suggest an  industrial work-camp, is so large that there is never any apparent threat  to the prisoners, which makes the final scene almost laughable in it's  logic. And the performances are competent but uninspired. One can only  salivate now over the idea of Richard Gere, who played the lead on  Broadway, circa American Gigolo, being directed in the film version by  Fassbinder.  On the plus side is Philip Glass' score, the designer pyjamas,  and the strength of the narrative of the play - the randomness of fate, the  nature of friendship, the cost of survival, and the need for love in a  world of cruelty. It is said that if the Nazis had won the war, sooner or  later everyone would have ended up in the gas chambers- the realisation of  the ultimate expression of inhumanity. The bleakness of this thought is  echoed in Sherman's text.",2,More leaning than bent,963100800,"07 9, 2000",2000,3259,"['remember', 'reading', 'book', 'little-known', 'fate', 'European', 'gypsies', 'Holocaust', 'having', 'same', 'reaction', 'did', 'discovering', 'play', 'Bent', 'largest', 'number', 'victims', 'Hitler', 'extermination', 'non-Aryans', 'were', 'Jews', 'minority', 'persecution', 'doomed', 'be', 'historical', 'footnote', 'Hitler', 'probably', 'still', 'chuckling', 'being', 'one', 'many', 'ironies', 'legacy', 'would', 'be', 'rolling', 'floor', 'how', 'destruction', 'gas', 'chambers', 'camps', 'were', 'liberated', 'denial', 'historical', 'revisionists', 'reconstructions', 'Shoah', 'TV', 'War', 'Rememberance', 'are', 'chilling', 'course', 'foolish', 'compare', 'suffering', 'one', 'abstractive', 'group', 'say', 'anti-semitism/I', 'say', 'homophobia/let', 'call', 'whole', 'thing', 'tragedy', 'Jews', 'so', 'overwhelming', 'divisiveness', 'thinking', 'impossible', 'avoid', 'other', 'undesirables', 'Third', 'Reich', 'be', 'political', 'dissidents', 'Catholics', 'mentally', 'ill', 'chronically', 'unemployed', 'criminals', 'artists', 'intellectuals', 'Slavs', 'Jehovah', 'Witnesses', 'clergymen', 'Gypsies', 'homosexuals', 'apologies', 'anyone', 'overlooked', 'point', 'subtlely', 'made', 'film', 'Bent', 'details', 'redeem', 'what', 'otherwise', 'disappointing', 'experience', 'see', 'how', 'German', 'children', 'played', 'adults', 'picnicked', 'site', 'Dachau', 'Just', 'imagine', 'circus', 'Auschwitz', 'where', 'smell', 'burning', 'flesh', 'hung', 'air', 'flames', 'ovens', 'rose', 'high', 'sky', 'observations', 'make', 'mockery', 'claims', 'protected', 'knew', 'nothing', 'camps', 'also', 'get', 'tantalising', 'glimpse', 'Ernst', 'Roehm', 'gay', 'leader', 'SA', 'murder', 'Night', 'Long', 'Knives', 'film', 'stylised', 'direction', 'Sean', 'Mathias', 'misguided', 'material', 'robbing', 'truth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'eroticism', 'opening', 'decadence', 'never', 'believed', 'actors', 'locations', 'were', 'German', 'Berlin', 'Dachau', 'are', 'specified', 'dialogue', 'fact', 'Roehm', 'soldiers', 'were', 'stationed', 'Lake', 'Wiessee', 'Munich', 'night', 'Considering', 'Martin', 'Sherman', 'wrote', 'play', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'played', 'lead', 'debut', 'staging', 'negligible', 'appearance', 'here', 'practically', 'insult', 'set', 'Dachau', 'interesting', 'choice', 'suggest', 'industrial', 'work-camp', 'so', 'large', 'never', 'apparent', 'threat', 'prisoners', 'final', 'scene', 'almost', 'laughable', 'logic', 'performances', 'are', 'competent', 'uninspired', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'salivate', 'now', 'idea', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'who', 'played', 'lead', 'Broadway', 'circa', 'American', 'Gigolo', 'being', 'directed', 'film', 'version', 'Fassbinder', 'plus', 'side', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'score', 'designer', 'pyjamas', 'strength', 'narrative', 'play', 'randomness', 'fate', 'nature', 'friendship', 'cost', 'survival', 'need', 'love', 'world', 'cruelty', 'said', 'Nazis', 'had', 'won', 'war', 'sooner', 'later', 'everyone', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'gas', 'chambers-', 'realisation', 'ultimate', 'expression', 'inhumanity', 'bleakness', 'thought', 'echoed', 'Sherman', 'text']",N/A

There's even a good cameo by Rupert Graves as a sadistic SS officer.  But how I wish Clive Owen had waited a few more years before playing Max, the lead character.  His film-acting abilities have grown since the time the film was made, and I think he would have added more depth to the character if the movie had been filmed in, say, 2004, rather than 1997.I couldn't really feel emotionally invested in Max's love for his fellow prisoner, Horst.  But I think this was the fault of the filmmakers - it's too obvious, at times, that this is the film of a play.  The dialogue in most instances is ""speechy"", like a play.  They had a great starting point, one that's not been covered in an English film before (the homosexual experience under the Nazi regime).  But the screenwriter and the director didn't open up the play; research and expand on it, give it depth.  There are individual scenes of great emotion.  But, just for instance - (SPOILER ALERT)Clive Owen is basically given a speech to recite after his friend is shot and he's holding him.  (END SPOILER)Max's soliliquy would be necessary for the stage production, but for a film, the more realistic approach would have been to let the devastated expression on Max's face in the close-up, and the action he takes directly afterward, say it all.I was a little taken aback by the cheap look of the concentration camp.  Frankly, it looked like the filmmakers had found an abandoned English factory site and surrounded it with barbed wire, to represent Dachau.  There seemed to be about five SS officers/guards for the whole camp.  And, it seemed to me, that there was far too much opportunity for Max and Horst to be talking during their march to the camp, and during their labor - didn't Nazi guards shoot people who talked on a march, and during roll call, etc.?  Again, all this talk would have necessary in the stage play - but for the film, surely some 'subtext', alternative way of developing the relationship between the two men, could have been incorporated?But as I said there are some individually powerful scenes, and good performances, which make this film worth seeing.  I just wish BENT had been taken further; that the film had been more like, possibly, Fosse's ""Cabaret"" in its depth and its look.  I think the filmmakers lost an opportunity to create a lasting, brilliant, emotional work of art, by only making 'Bent, the play as a film'.",3,"Good, but...",1137024000,"01 12, 2006",2006,2569,"['enjoyed', 'certain', 'performances', 'film', 'particularly', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'turn', 'opportunistic', 'drag', 'queen', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'in-the-closet', 'Uncle', 'Freddie', 'even', 'good', 'cameo', 'Rupert', 'Graves', 'sadistic', 'SS', 'officer', 'how', 'wish', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'had', 'waited', 'few', 'more', 'years', 'playing', 'Max', 'lead', 'character', 'film-acting', 'abilities', 'have', 'grown', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'more', 'depth', 'character', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'say', '2004', 'rather', '1997.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'Max', 'love', 'fellow', 'prisoner', 'Horst', 'think', 'was', 'fault', 'filmmakers', 'too', 'obvious', 'times', 'film', 'play', 'dialogue', 'most', 'instances', 'speechy', 'play', 'had', 'great', 'starting', 'point', 'one', 'not', 'been', 'covered', 'English', 'film', 'homosexual', 'experience', 'Nazi', 'regime', 'screenwriter', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'open', 'up', 'play', 'research', 'expand', 'give', 'depth', 'are', 'individual', 'scenes', 'great', 'emotion', 'just', 'instance', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'basically', 'given', 'speech', 'recite', 'friend', 'shot', 'holding', 'END', 'SPOILER', 'Max', 'soliliquy', 'would', 'be', 'necessary', 'stage', 'production', 'film', 'more', 'realistic', 'approach', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'let', 'devastated', 'expression', 'Max', 'face', 'close-up', 'action', 'directly', 'afterward', 'say', 'was', 'little', 'taken', 'aback', 'cheap', 'look', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Frankly', 'looked', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'found', 'abandoned', 'English', 'factory', 'site', 'surrounded', 'barbed', 'wire', 'represent', 'Dachau', 'seemed', 'be', 'about', 'five', 'SS', 'officers/guards', 'whole', 'camp', 'seemed', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'opportunity', 'Max', 'Horst', 'be', 'talking', 'march', 'camp', 'labor', 'did', ""n't"", 'Nazi', 'guards', 'shoot', 'people', 'who', 'talked', 'march', 'roll', 'call', 'etc.', 'Again', 'all', 'talk', 'would', 'have', 'necessary', 'stage', 'play', 'film', 'surely', ""'subtext"", 'alternative', 'way', 'developing', 'relationship', 'two', 'men', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'incorporated', 'said', 'are', 'individually', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'good', 'performances', 'make', 'film', 'seeing', 'just', 'wish', 'BENT', 'had', 'been', 'taken', 'further', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'possibly', 'Fosse', 'Cabaret', 'depth', 'look', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'lost', 'opportunity', 'create', 'lasting', 'brilliant', 'emotional', 'work', 'art', 'only', 'making', ""'Bent"", 'play', 'film']",N/A
152861,A1SDPA1J98UP4L,0792845226,"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF ""Wolf""","[5, 8]","I loved Bent the DVD version because it was awesome.  Bent's moves slowly at points but it is to good use as it is an interval to think.  Bent is a DVD that gives its audience A LOT in substance and meaning to think about at all points.My only problem with BENT is that it sanitized the experience of the train ride to the camps.  I have been blessed to talk to a few camp survivors in my lifetime and from what they told me NO train car would have ever been allowed to have so few people in it.  From what I was told train cars going to the camps were always filled to overflowing such that the humans therein had to fight to breathe and many did not win that battle to get their required supply of vital oxygen.  The NAZI murder machine was nothing if not horrifically and brutally efficient.  I do not doubt for a moment NAZI monster guards indulged their most saddistic banal and inhumane passions both subtle and gross on its passengers in manners shown in the movie but the scenes in that almost empty cattle car just could not have happened. NAZI's had human cargo quotas to fill and kept indepth records  insuring every millimeter of space in that car would have been used for the most inhumane packing of human beings for mass transport.My other slight beef with the movie is that it humanized the NAZI officers in this film way too much.  Maybe a few NAZI's required the forced civility of saying sir, no sir, yes sir but most NAZI's allowed themselves to de-evolve to a status of inhumane brute.  There was little civility from NAZI guards to camp inmates.  To call a camp inmate sir coffered too much residual core humanity on the camp inmate when the thrust of all NAZI training at the camps was to de-emphasize any aspect of humanity shared with camp inmates in every way with every NAZI officers words actions and utterances.No movie no matter how great its direction or budget can accurately define for people who did not live through it the true abject horror of daily life in the concentration camps for inmates.  There was never enough food to go around such that their were often fights for food among the inmates with some people being killed for stale bread.  Another thing that irked me about this movie was that it had a concentration camp inmate doing push ups.  From what my survivor friends told me when an inmate did not have to exert energy in the service of MONSTER NAZI captors they lay still as possible to conserve precious energy and certainly did not waste energy doing push ups.I know some people got more food than others because the systems were totally for sale so it is a stretch but maybe some inmates got more food so he had more energy.  Even if I suspended truth to accept a camp inmate was doing push ups in a concentration camp the movie extends the same theme showing something I just know could not have happened in reality.  A Camp inmate doing push ups while in the close presence of a NAZI Guard Monster, thus betraying that he is well fed and seeking to get stronger when his service does not serve NAZI War Goals, I am sorry I can't beleive that could ever happen.In the camps the most inhumane well throught out oppression was job one for the Monster NAZI guards and survival was job one for the innocent inmates.  Any camp inmate obviously trying to build himself up physically mentally or in any other way was both a real threat and an insult to NAZI monsters who fancied themselves ""the master race"".  My real problem with this movie is not the story because, that was nice, well acted and all.  My problem with the movie is it so humanized both the unimaginably horrific evil vile NAZI monsters and the  perfectly inhumane Concentration Camp experience as to make easier the jobs of racist revisionist history writers who want to down play the holocaust or worse suggest it never happened.Maybe I am wrong but, I do not feel Monster NAZI's or the horrible concentration camps should be made to appear one bit more humane or civil than they were in truth and this movie does just that.  I think the ugliness of the camps should be shown in their completely ugly graphic reality or that part of the experience should not be shown.  If human kind is to learn lessons they never forget we can not start watering down the true horrific nature of the very events that all good people work each day to assure never happen again anywhere.I gave the movie three stars because while it in no true way shares the nasty profound abiding graphic nature and detailed unspeakable horrors that was everyday existance under NAZI monster rule in foul festering fetted concentration camps, it does try and I appluad the effort.  This film despite its many flaws tries to insure the world never forgets the NAZI's the camps and all the continuing legacy of evil they left our world.  The film is a couragous effort and does have a story to tell that should be heard by all.Personally I just wish as much film were used to show the Holocaust that occured here in the United States when it enslaved and murdered millions of black people during slavery.  I wish this world did not have such a glaring double standard when it came to remembering holocaust's because what was done in the 1930's by Hitler's devotee's while in every way bad has its equal in the United States during times of Slavery and Jim Crow.  There was just no need for the NAZI Arm bands and organization when the United States upheld and fostered slavery because the color of one's skin itself was all the NAZI like identification you needed at the time.Had the world truly learned from the brutality and inhumane ugliness the lessons of Slavery reveled in the United States maybe their would have been no Holocaust in Germany.  Anytime the dignity of human life is made cheap anywhere Life by default human life becomes cheap in the minds of people everywhere no matter what its color, religion or sexual identity.  Maybe this movie will open some eyes to a greater humanity thats why I gave it four stars for its noble efforts in helping better the world.",4,BENT - A DVD I LOVED MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY!

152864,A18C1PCR8WUAST,0792845226,"Tracy Hodson ""Awi Usdi""","[19, 21]","This film is definitely not for the faint-hearted, nor those who choose to see human beings as ""good or bad"" and situations as ""black or white."" The main character, Max, is a bit of a rotter at the start of the piece, played with an unapologetic grin by Clive Owen (the grin gradually fades and fractures). The film opens by cross-cutting between the morning after one hell of a night before, during which Max hung out with his wild friends in an orgiastic melee that included dancers of both (and some questionable) sexes, Mick Jagger as Greta, a singer who hangs over the group in a circular sit-down trapeze as she sings, cocaine-snorting storm troopers (costumed and genuine), and Max now waking to find a strange, lovely boy in his bed (the excellent Nikolaj Coster-Waldau of ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Wimbledon""), and his enraged live-in lover screaming at him.  In the confusion of ""what the hell happened last night--I don't remember"", they are interrupted by Storm Troopers who slit the throat of this lovely one-night stand while Max and his lover run for their lives to Greta, who dresses them as respectable men, burns her wardrobes, and sends them on to get to safety as best they can. As this night obviously represents Max's usual M.O., his shallow self-interest is  believable enough that much later, in Dachau, we watch him gentled by the first love of his life, Horst (played with quiet self-confidence by Lothaire Bluteau) with as much surprise and joy as Max himself seems to experience.After Max's headlong flight to his gay but closeted Uncle, played by Ian McKellen in a small but pivotal role, ends in failure to get papers for his lover as well as himself, the two hide out in the Black Forest of Germany, then end up captured on a train ride to hell, during which the boy is beaten to death and thrown off the train, and Max's psyche disintegrates into chaos as he tries to deny the reality of his new life and its morally repugnant choices--when it comes down to his life or his lover's, he chooses his own, following the Nazi guard's unspeakable order (the guard is played with cool, scary detachment by the impeccable Rupert Graves), and then follows this by another act (that must be left to the viewer to hear about to believe). By this time, his self-loathing has reached a level that is so unbearable, he makes yet another choice to try to survive that will somehow, in his own mind, make acceptable what he's just done.He chooses to debark the train in disguise as a Jew, rather than as the doubly ostracized, pink triangle-d homosexual. Max's deceit is quickly understood to be desperate but bone-deep, not merely a ploy. Max cannot be honest with himself about any aspect of his own character--despite the fact that he's constantly calling himself ""a terrible person,"" his arrogant narcissism is obvious, as is his constant belief in his ability to ""make deals"" which will guarantee his survival. Only as his relationship with Horst develops does he begin to show signs of character. Earlier in the film, he has taken his young dancer partner under his wing and though resentful, has not abandoned him, a glimpse of what Max can become, but he hasn't behaved with much honor so far. This renouncement of his identity as a ""fluffer"" (his uncle's word) is his final selfish act. After this, Horst's influence begins to take hold and love enters his life, probably for the first time. As the two of them move rocks from one pile to another, only to move the same pile back to its original spot over and over again, their separation from the rest of the inmates of Dachau allows them to develop the sort of intimacy that Max has never even tried to seek in the midst of his previously hedonistic Berlin life. (I like, too, that their story stays isolated and doesn't get lost in expensive set-dressing that tries to re-create all of Dachau. The location appears to be an industrial site, and this separation keeps the focus appropriately narrow.)I like Mick Jagger as the cross-dressing chanteuse of the group's nighttime rubble ""Nightclub"" and love that serious actors like Jude Law and Rachel Weisz show up for momentary bits that you'll miss if you blink, and that Ian McKellen took this small role as Max's uncle. Later, the always-great Paul Bettany shows up as another casually sadistic Nazi guard and brings about the film's denoument. This comradarie reminded me of ""And the Band Played On..."" where everyone pitched in to get the project made and to give it weight through their presence. It's an important story, and one which reminds us that the chant really shouldn't be ""6 million dead,"" but rather and with all respect, ""10 million dead,"" which is the estimated count when one adds the additional 4 million gay men and women, Catholics, political dissidents, Poles, Germans who wouldn't go along with the Reich or who were merely ""intellectuals"", French Resistance fighters (those who weren't shot), actual criminals (though who knows what that word meant during the Reich?) and miscellaneous ""undesirables"" who were not Jewish, but who suffered and died, too. And it's a good history lesson to see how homosexuals claimed the infamous upside-down pink triangle, turned it point up, and began to wear it with pride rather than shame--a wonderful example of the reclamation of self. In point of fact, Hitler's swastika was an ancient, universal ""walking star""  or ""walking circle"", a symbol that existed in Neolithic Europe as well as amongst Native Americans, as a symbol of transformation and growth. We Indians here have tried to reclaim it, as it was a powerful healing symbol, but it's hard to wear a bracelet with that sign on it, no matter what its history. But this is the reason Hitler chose it--it had a legacy of powerful change, and he stole it, as he stole other symbols of mystical power.The love-making scene between Max and Horst is beautifully acted, especially by Bluteau, and its subtlety was a masterstroke of writing--it is more emotionally deep than any ""sex"" scene could have been. It is a profound statement of the power of love and the assertion that love-making occurs in the mind as much as in the body. It feels, too, that this may have been the first time Max actually made love, rather than had sex, and it is moving and beautiful. By now Max has begun to change, and his capacity for unselfish love blossoms, ironically in the worst place on Earth--quite a wonderful bit of writing.The one problem with the film is the score. Phillip Glass' shallow, repetitive, irritatingly New Age-y music is, if you can imagine, more annoying than the idea of moving rocks back and forth. Only the final solo is beautiful and up to the standard of the rest of the film. His music is like Michael Nyman's--it either works beautifully or is a disaster, and I found it disastrous in this case. The musical cues are also abrupt and distracting, and in such a moody film, the last thing one wants is to be jarred out of a reverie.The heart-breaking but defining, self-affirming ending is often called a ""downer"" but I found it to be the opposite. To finally take his identity and his destiny into his own hands was Max's only way to truly ""survive"" both his loss and the camp--as Horst says earlier, such an act drives the Nazis crazy because it is self-willed, and their deepest goal was to destroy the will, not merely the life, of each camp inmate. Max's act is an escape beyond capture, and ultimately, his truest human act.",4,A compelling recounting of the Holocaust from another angle,1123977600,"08 14, 2005",2005,7482,"['film', 'definitely',

152865,A39UKBJJXJ82FO,0792845226,Tristan,"[4, 5]","Clive Owen plays Max, a loose, carefree, and cowardly playboy who is captured by Nazis along with his gay partner and shipped off to the Dachau labor camp. He pretends to be in the yellow star unit meaning that he is Jewish instead of the pink triangle unit meaning that he is gay. But he meets a member of the pink triangle named Horst who he befriends and begins developing feelings for as they work day after day moving rocks from one place to another. The film is based on a play of the same name that gained much critical acclaim and won many awards.The easiest way to look at this film is as a message film, with the message being to always stay true to who you are and to be strong of the community that you represent. The film nails this concept pretty much about as solidly as a message film ever could. Unfortunately, the film fails to rise above that. It fails to both entertain or to intrigue. The film feels blatant and obvious in it's storytelling, and as a result it loses the sincerity that it requires to work as a film. The film caters to it's target audience and does nothing to spark the audience's interest in the characters themselves. As a result, you never really care about the main character Max, nor do you care about anyone else in this picture. The film, instead, romanticizes the situation. It becomes a celebration of sexuality rather than humanity. The film opens with an orgy and several gay sex scenes, all directed with the intention of pleasing the audience, and then it dissolves into English soap opera territory before jarringly throwing the audience into the horrific atmosphere of the death camps. Even when we are in the death camps, however, the film doesn't really try to build any sympathy or character. We empathize somewhat with the plight of Max and the terrible things that he is put through, but we don't really see any reason to care more or less about his character or his choice of actions.Things only get more and more ludicrous as the film continues. There's a sexual torture scene on the way to the camp, the endless scenes of sexual tension between the men at the camp, the many many moments of bland atmosphere in which there is no dialogue. All these scenes are well done, but none of them add anything to either the characters, the situations, the theme of the film, or the plot. All exist only for the audience's enjoyment. This film could have been just as effective without these scenes, which only increase the running time of the film. There are scenes that come off so stagey that it becomes cringe-inducing. There's even a scene of gun violence that feels extremely prepared and strangely very choreographed in a ridiculously blatant way. In addition, the continuity falls apart as well. The shooting scene results in a character's death, yet there are no bullet holes or blood on his clothing. To make things worse, a character puts the dean person's clothes on himself and ends up making the goof even more obvious than it already is. This film is a mess!Bent is a failure of a film. I appreciate what Sean Mathias was trying to do, but he really mishandles it. There are some things that work, and those things are mostly in the early scenes. There is an early scene involving Mick Jagger, in a top-notch performance as a drag queen, that is pretty cool. Ian McKellen makes a brief appearance as well, and I found his character to be more interesting than anyone else in the film. The performances aren't bad. There is some decent scenery. The music score is somewhat memorable. The scenes on the train are really harrowing. The film isn't horribly made, but there's really no reason for me to recommend it. I understand that this film has somewhat of a following in the queer cinema realm, but I've never really liked most of those films anyway. Just do yourself a favor and skip this one. It really isn't any good at all. I think that this kind of story can be told successfully, but this isn't worth seeing.",2,"Well intentioned, but really not very good at all",1266537600,"02 19, 2010",2010,3980,"['Clive', 'Owen', 'Max', 'loose', 'carefree', 'cowardly', 'playboy', 'who', 'captured', 'Nazis', 'gay', 'partner', 'shipped', 'Dachau', 'labor', 'camp', 'be', 'yellow', 'star', 'unit', 'meaning', 'Jewish', 'instead', 'pink', 'triangle', 'unit', 'meaning', 'gay', 'member', 'pink', 'triangle', 'named', 'Horst', 'who', 'developing', 'feelings', 'work', 'day', 'day', 'moving', 'rocks', 'one', 'place', 'film', 'based', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'gained', 'much', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'won', 'many', 'awards.The', 'easiest', 'way', 'look', 'film', 'message', 'film', 'message', 'being', 'always', 'stay', 'true', 'who', 'are', 'be', 'strong', 'community', 'represent', 'film', 'concept', 'pretty', 'much', 'as', 'solidly', 'message', 'film', 'ever', 'could', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'rise', 'entertain', 'intrigue', 'film', 'feels', 'blatant', 'obvious', 'storytelling', 'result', 'sincerity', 'work', 'film', 'film', 'caters', 'target', 'audience', 'nothing', 'spark', 'audience', 'interest', 'characters', 'result', 'never', 'really', 'care', 'main', 'character', 'Max', 'do', 'care', 'anyone', 'else', 'picture', 'film', 'instead', 'situation', 'celebration', 'sexuality', 'rather', 'humanity', 'film', 'orgy', 'several', 'gay', 'sex', 'scenes', 'directed', 'intention', 'pleasing', 'audience', 'then', 'English', 'soap', 'opera', 'territory', 'jarringly', 'throwing', 'audience', 'horrific', 'atmosphere', 'death', 'camps', 'Even', 'when', 'are', 'death', 'camps', 'however', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'try', 'build', 'sympathy', 'character', 'empathize', 'somewhat', 'plight', 'Max', 'terrible', 'things', 'put', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'reason', 'care', 'more', 'less', 'character', 'choice', 'actions.Things', 'only', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'ludicrous', 'film', 'sexual', 'torture', 'scene', 'way', 'camp', 'endless', 'scenes', 'sexual', 'tension', 'men', 'camp', 'many', 'many', 'moments', 'bland', 'atmosphere', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'none', 'add', 'anything', 'either', 'characters', 'situations', 'theme', 'film', 'plot', 'exist', 'only', 'audience', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'effective', 'scenes', 'only', 'running', 'time', 'film', 'are', 'scenes', 'come', 'so', 'stagey', 'cringe-inducing', 'even', 'scene', 'gun', 'violence', 'extremely', 'prepared', 'strangely', 'very', 'choreographed', 'ridiculously', 'blatant', 'way', 'addition', 'continuity', 'apart', 'as', 'well', 'shooting', 'scene', 'results', 'character', 'death', 'yet', 'are', 'bullet', 'blood', 'clothing', 'make', 'things', 'worse', 'character', 'dean', 'person', 'clothes', 'up', 'making', 'goof', 'even', 'more', 'obvious', 'already', 'film', 'mess', 'Bent', 'failure', 'film', 'appreciate', 'what', 'Sean', 'Mathias', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'really', 'are', 'things', 'work', 'things', 'are', 'mostly', 'early', 'scenes', 'early', 'scene', 'involving', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'top-notch', 'performance', 'drag', 'queen', 'pretty', 'cool', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'brief', 'appearance', 'as', 'well', 'found', 'character', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'anyone', 'else', 'film', 'performances', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'decent', 'scenery', 'music', 'score', 'somewhat', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'train', 'are', 'really', 'harrowing', 'film', ""n't"", 'horribly', 'made', 'really', 'reason', 'recommend', 'understand', 'film', 'somewhat', 'following', 'queer', 'cinema', 'realm', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'most', 'films', 'anyway', 'Just', 'do', 'favor', 'skip', 'one', 'really', ""n't"", 'good', 'think', 'kind', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'told', 'successfully', ""n't"", 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A
152866,ANN4JW1E08AS6,0792845226,tuberacer,"[1, 2]","Bent is a mysterious production. I don't understand how it ended up going to where it goes. The movie opens with vivacious scenes with many extras, but then, loses people as it moves along. Is there some peculiar reason for this? If you're thinking this is going to take you into scenes like in ""Schindler's List"" or ""Sophie's Choice,"" to get a sense of a Nazi death camp, well, don't expect that. The camp in this film is practically deserted. What happened? Did they run out of money to hire extras? No mud, no smoking crematoriums, no guard towers, no huddling masses. Mostly, just the two main characters and a couple of Nazis in some dusty rock quarry. There are some wide shots of the locale, but no one else is around. Where is everyone?I guess what happened was it became more and more like the play where a simple stage is presented while much of the scenario is only alluded to in the dialogue. But this isn't a play, it's a movie. The different medium, you would hope, should demand a different type of production, but this movie, while it starts out like a movie, ends like a play, and very disappointingly so. Maybe if there had been a more surreal approach to this film, the desolate landscape might have worked. I'm thinking, maybe something like the approach Julie Taymor used when she presented Shakespeare's play ""Titus Andronicus"" in her surreal film ""Titus,"" where symbolism and deviation from expected reality are consistent beginning to end. Bent is not consistent that way. It takes us from a somewhat real world of Berlin to a minimalist surreal world of Dachau.What's really disappointing is, just at the moment the movie becomes most interesting, it ends. I want to see how this character continues after his transformation. Instead, the story just leaps--dare I say?--to a cheap melodramatic ending. Wow, the setup was so great at that moment, and then it's like an axe just comes flying down and ends it. This was the moment where the real story begins. This is the new story where the scriptwriter would have been most challenged. How will this character survive now? Instead, the scriptwriter just writes in an ending, signs his x, and leaves. Now's not the time to drop the ball, I was thinking. This ending is not the signature of a great writer. Creative writing 101: follow the interesting, not the obvious, especially if it leads to a fearful place. Go to the dangerous situation. That's where your audience wants you to take them. Don't take an easy way out instead.The acting is good, not great. Bluteau's performance is the best. Clive Owen is convincing. Ian McKellen's part is very small. Sorry, Mick, you're one of the best white rock'n'rollers of all time, but what makes you great as a rock-n-roller is what undermines you as an actor. Mick's acting is mostly stilted. His part is small too.What's great about this film is it really gives you a sense, almost on the abstract level, of the dangers of the far right. On the other hand, the whole Nazi situation is, at the same time, simply a backdrop for a character's journey of personal reflection and transformation. I just wish that character had been explored more.
