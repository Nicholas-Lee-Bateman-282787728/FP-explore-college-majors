795970,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B00018YCIM,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[3, 5]","Dave Chappelle is hilarious, plain and simple. People who think his comedy is overly offensive only says so out of ignorance. By watching Chappelle's Show, you'll quickly learn that Dave makes fun of himself as much as he does other people, and most of his comedy is based off of common American stereotypes, as well as current affairs and pop-culture. Dave's style is often shameless, which is what makes it so funny, and unadulterated.Season 1 is easily his best, I think, because it introduces Dave's most legendary characters. Though the entire series has a lot worth watching, a few episodes stick out to me as the best. And it starts with the very first episode, where Dave plays a blind, black white supremacist well-known for his racist books. From there, Dave introduces his second greatest character (behind season two's Rick James) in Tyrone Biggums, a crackhead always out for the next rock. Then, there's Paul Mooney in ""Ask a Black Dude""; there's Dave's version of The Real World; a pimp's convention where some more of Dave's most outrageous character are introduced; a play on the History Channel and the gang wars of the 1980s; and of course, you can't forget Dave's portrayal of R. Kelly and his recent troubles.The bonus features are pretty decent too, with some deleted scenes and bloopers taken from the many episodes, with some more coverage of ""Ask a Black Dude."" Plus, five of the episodes, the best episode at that, have commentary from Dave and Neal Brennan, the co-creator of Chappelle's Show.As a package, this can't be beat. It has what is easily the funniest stuff to come out in a long time, without being watered down by what is popular on TV today. Dave made his own way with this series, and season one is his best example of his comedy style. Pick this up if you've seen the series and liked it. Or, if you're not that sensitive and can laugh at yourself, I'd also recommend Chappelle's show for you.

Not only is the skit in question hilarious, it basically defines the type of humor Dave Chappelle brings to the comedy scene.  I don't think the television viewing audience has ever seen anything like this before - certainly not to the extremes that Dave Chappelle takes it.  When he jokes about the fact the show has not been cancelled yet, it actually rings with a bit of truth.  Very few comedians could get away with this type of over-the-top humor.To say that this is mature humor is something of an understatement.  Adult language abounds, and all the bleeps you heard on television are now removed - thus, the Uncensored! tagline.  You'll find a lot of jokes centered on human anatomy - especially female anatomy.  Far beyond everything else, though, is a relentless comedic skewering of racism.  Some would probably consider this a racist show, actually - the ""n word"" is used in abundance, and stereotypes of blacks, Asians, whites, and other races are exploited shamelessly.  The whole point of the race-based comedy, though, is to show just how extreme and ridiculous racist thinking and behavior really is.  Some people won't ""get it,"" of course, and they will probably think Chappelle's Show is one of the most offensive things they have ever witnessed - and that's OK.  The majority of viewers, I believe, will ""get it"" and will join me in an extended laugh-fest that lasts throughout all twelve episodes of Season One as well as the bonus materials included in this DVD offering.Among the gut-bustingly funny stuff you will find in Chappelle's Show Season One are the antics of crack addict Tyrone Biggums (including a visit to a drug awareness day at an elementary school), Chappelle-ized scenes from hit films such as Roots and The Matrix, a news report detailing the profound aftereffects brought about by the paying of reparations for slavery, ""Great Moments in Hookup History,"" a ""Real World"" episode featuring one really white guy living with five crazy African-Americans, a hard-hitting documentary detailing the racism of famous animal performers, a documentary covering great inner city gang wars of the 1980s, an interracial episode of Trading Spouses, numerous Chappelle-ized television ads, Ask a Black Dude features with comedian Paul Mooney, a hilarious look at the international Player Hater Ball, and of course a lot of crude jokes about drugs and bodily functions.  The only bad thing about these episodes is the fact that they are sometimes rather short.  Chappelle featured rap and hip-hop musical guests on each show, but those segments are not included on nine of the twelve episodes you get here (and it's only a half-hour show to begin with).The comedy is a little uneven at times.  A few skits never really catch fire and are thus forgettable, but the vast majority of the material here will have you rolling in the aisles.  Even the kind of toilet humor that normally isn't that funny will have you in stitches because Chappelle just keeps going to the well so many times that he makes it funny despite itself.Five of the episodes come with audio commentary by Dave Chappelle and the show's co-creator Neal Brennan (who is white, by the way), as does the extra 29-minute feature of bloopers and deleted scenes.  I was actually a little disappointed by the audio commentary; it was informational but not as funny as I had expected.  The bloopers and deleted scenes were also less than hilarious - but I realized long ago (thanks to Dick Clarke and Ed McMahon) that bloopers really aren't very funny much of the time.  All these extras are just icing on the cake, though, as the twelve episodes of the show more than make this Season One collection worth the money.  Heck, it's worth it for just the blind, black white supremacist feature by itself.",5,"Fearless, controversial, and absolutely hilarious",1099526400,"11 4, 2004",2004,4254,"['had', 'caught', 'snippets', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'here', 'there', 'before', 'had', 'never', 'made', 'point', 'actually', 'sitting', 'down', 'watching', 'complete', 'episode', 'Then', 'friend', 'mine', 'told', 'hilarious', 'skit', 'featuring', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'black', 'white', 'supremacist', 'blind', ""n't"", 'know', 'actually', 'black', 'man', 'was', 'only', 'half', 'as', 'funny', 'said', 'was', 'knew', 'had', 'see', 'so', 'soon', 'bought', 'copy', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'Season', 'One', 'Not', 'only', 'skit', 'question', 'hilarious', 'basically', 'type', 'humor', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'comedy', 'scene', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'television', 'viewing', 'audience', 'ever', 'seen', 'anything', 'certainly', 'not', 'extremes', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'When', 'fact', 'show', 'not', 'been', 'cancelled', 'yet', 'actually', 'bit', 'truth', 'Very', 'few', 'comedians', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'type', 'over-the-top', 'humor.To', 'say', 'mature', 'humor', 'something', 'understatement', 'Adult', 'language', 'abounds', 'bleeps', 'heard', 'television', 'are', 'now', 'removed', 'thus', 'Uncensored', 'tagline', ""'ll"", 'find', 'lot', 'jokes', 'centered', 'human', 'anatomy', 'especially', 'female', 'anatomy', 'Far', 'everything', 'else', 'relentless', 'comedic', 'skewering', 'racism', 'would', 'probably', 'consider', 'racist', 'show', 'actually', 'n', 'word', 'used', 'abundance', 'stereotypes', 'blacks', 'Asians', 'whites', 'other', 'races', 'are', 'exploited', 'shamelessly', 'whole', 'point', 'race-based', 'comedy', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'extreme', 'ridiculous', 'racist', 'thinking', 'behavior', 'really', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'course', 'will', 'probably', 'think', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'one', 'most', 'offensive', 'things', 'have', 'ever', 'witnessed', 'OK', 'majority', 'viewers', 'believe', 'will', 'get', 'will', 'join', 'extended', 'laugh-fest', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'Season', 'One', 'as', 'well', 'bonus', 'materials', 'included', 'DVD', 'gut-bustingly', 'funny', 'stuff', 'will', 'find', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'Season', 'One', 'are', 'antics', 'crack', 'addict', 'Tyrone', 'Biggums', 'including', 'visit', 'drug', 'awareness', 'day', 'elementary', 'school', 'Chappelle-ized', 'scenes', 'hit', 'films', 'such', 'Roots', 'Matrix', 'news', 'report', 'detailing', 'profound', 'brought', 'paying', 'reparations', 'slavery', 'Great', 'Moments', 'Hookup', 'History', 'Real', 'World', 'episode', 'featuring', 'one', 'really', 'white', 'guy', 'living', 'five', 'crazy', 'African-Americans', 'hard-hitting', 'documentary', 'detailing', 'racism', 'famous', 'animal', 'performers', 'documentary', 'covering', 'great', 'inner', 'city', 'gang', 'wars', '1980s', 'interracial', 'episode', 'Trading', 'Spouses', 'numerous', 'Chappelle-ized', 'television', 'ads', 'Ask', 'Black', 'Dude', 'comedian', 'Paul', 'Mooney', 'hilarious', 'look', 'international', 'Player', 'Hater', 'Ball', 'course', 'lot', 'crude', 'jokes', 'drugs', 'bodily', 'functions', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'episodes', 'fact', 'are', 'sometimes', 'rather', 'short', 'Chappelle', 'featured', 'rap', 'hip-hop', 'musical', 'guests', 'show', 'segments', 'are', 'not', 'included', 'nine', 'twelve', 'get', 'here', 'only', 'half-hour', 'show', 'begin', '.The', 'comedy', 'little', 'uneven', 'times', 'few', 'skits', 'never', 'really', 'catch', 'fire', 'are', 'thus', 'forgettable', 'vast', 'majority', 'material', 'here', 'will', 'have', 'rolling', 'aisles', 'Even', 'kind', 'toilet', 'humor', 'normally', ""n't"", 'funny', 'will', 'have', 'stitches', 'Chappelle', 'just', 'going', 'well', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'funny', 'itself.Five', 'episodes', 'come', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'show', 'co-creator', 'Neal', 'Brennan', 'who', 'white', 'way', 'extra', '29-minute', 'feature', 'bloopers', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'was', 'actually', 'little', 'disappointed', 'audio', 'commentary', 'was', 'informational', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'had', 'expected', 'bloopers', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'also', 'less', 'hilarious', 'realized', 'long', 'ago', 'thanks', 'Dick', 'Clarke', 'Ed', 'McMahon', 'bloopers', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'funny', 'much', 'time', 'extras', 'are', 'just', 'icing', 'cake', 'though', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'show', 'more', 'make', 'Season', 'One', 'collection', 'money', 'Heck', 'just', 'blind', 'black', 'white', 'supremacist', 'feature']",Chappelle's Show - Season 1

I mean, how many people in this day and age go this far in their comedy?In early 2003, Dave Chappelle started his own show on Comedy Central, ""Chappelle's Show"" (well, duh, you're looking at it right now). It was an instant hit. Why? Simple: it's funny, outrageous, and pushes the envelope in ways previously thought unimaginable (check out the ""Black White Supremacist"" sketch!). Dave Chappelle is charismatic with the crowd, and knows how to talk to an audience. His voices, attitude, comedy, and mannerisms, rolled into one, make for some funny, funny stuff. This is sort of like ""In Living Color"" for the new millenium.If you're looking for the ""I'm Rick James B***h"" sketch, it's not on here (I think it's season two). This is before everyone started running around using that catchphrase. This is from early 2003, when the only kids in my class who watched it were me and two of my friends, and we would go into class the next day quoting it while everyone else looked on like we were crazy (um.. never mind).

The response to THE DAVE CHAPPELLE SHOW was so incredible, so phenomenal that I knew I must be missing something, having never watched an episode of it on Comedy Central.  I searched several stores, trying to find a copy, and I was always informed, &quot;Oh, good luck finding that because we sell out of it before we've even thrown away the shipping box.&quot;  Finally, at a lone video store in an upscale shopping mall, I found a copy, bought it right away, and went home ...... and watched all twelve episodes, laughing (almost) hysterically all the while!The skits are not for the feint-of-heart.  What Chappelle does (a send-up of cultural norms by infusing it with a throwback to a time when the likes of Richard Pryor set the comedy standard) is absolutely daring, bold, incredible, and hilarious ... but it is not for everyone.  Some will find his brand of comedy offensive because of today's pervasive (and possibly corrosive) political correctness, but those viewers who are inclined to &quot;try anything for a laugh&quot; will find plenty to laugh about as Chappelle lampoons everything from the concept of having one's own show all the way to satirizing popular trends in television (his send up of &quot;Trading Places&quot; becoming &quot;Trading Spouses&quot; his hilarious) and all the way back to making fun of himself.  It's absolute brilliance.One thing that I've found missing from most reviews I've read is the fact that Dave Chappelle -- unlike a host of other comedians who get granted their own television program -- CAN ACTUALLY ACT!  Largely, he plays cultural stereotypes (the black crack addict, the black streetwise punk, etc.), but when he has to play it straight (the khaki-black news reporter, the everyday husband) he does so with incredible reserve, poise, and talent.  THAT is perhaps the trump card behind the genius of this show: the man in the center is not only gifted with a unique vision but he has the skills to communicate that vision (whether offensive or not to others) in a manner that should honestly unwrap any critical arguments against the show.  He's talented, he clearly doesn't take himself seriously, and he's likable.Buy this and enjoy!",5,"Others Have Said It Better, But ..",1083369600,"05 1, 2004",2004,2301,"['was', 'first', 'DVD', 'television', 'series', 'purchased', 'COMPLETELY', 'word-of-mouth', 'critical', 'reviews', 'response', 'THE', 'DAVE', 'CHAPPELLE', 'SHOW', 'was', 'so', 'incredible', 'phenomenal', 'knew', 'must', 'be', 'missing', 'something', 'having', 'never', 'watched', 'episode', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'searched', 'several', 'stores', 'trying', 'find', 'copy', 'was', 'always', 'informed', 'quot', 'Oh', 'good', 'luck', 'finding', 'sell', ""'ve"", 'even', 'thrown', 'away', 'shipping', 'box.', 'quot', 'Finally', 'lone', 'video', 'store', 'upscale', 'shopping', 'mall', 'found', 'copy', 'bought', 'right', 'away', 'went', 'home', 'watched', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'laughing', 'almost', 'hysterically', 'while', 'skits', 'are', 'not', 'feint-of-heart', 'What', 'Chappelle', 'send-up', 'cultural', 'norms', 'infusing', 'throwback', 'time', 'when', 'likes', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'set', 'comedy', 'standard', 'absolutely', 'daring', 'bold', 'incredible', 'hilarious', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'find', 'brand', 'comedy', 'offensive', 'today', 'pervasive', 'possibly', 'corrosive', 'political', 'correctness', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'inclined', 'quot', 'try', 'anything', 'laugh', 'quot', 'will', 'find', 'plenty', 'laugh', 'Chappelle', 'lampoons', 'everything', 'concept', 'having', 'one', 'own', 'show', 'way', 'satirizing', 'popular', 'trends', 'television', 'send', 'quot', 'Trading', 'Places', 'quot', 'becoming', 'quot', 'Trading', 'Spouses', 'quot', 'hilarious', 'way', 'back', 'making', 'fun', 'absolute', 'brilliance.One', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'found', 'missing', 'most', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'fact', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'host', 'other', 'comedians', 'who', 'get', 'granted', 'own', 'television', 'program', 'CAN', 'ACTUALLY', 'ACT', 'Largely', 'cultural', 'stereotypes', 'black', 'crack', 'addict', 'black', 'streetwise', 'punk', 'etc', 'when', 'play', 'straight', 'khaki-black', 'news', 'reporter', 'everyday', 'husband', 'so', 'incredible', 'reserve', 'poise', 'talent', 'perhaps', 'trump', 'card', 'genius', 'show', 'man', 'center', 'not', 'only', 'gifted', 'unique', 'vision', 'skills', 'communicate', 'vision', 'offensive', 'not', 'others', 'manner', 'should', 'honestly', 'unwrap', 'critical', 'arguments', 'show', 'talented', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'enjoy']",Chappelle's Show - Season 1

By playing up to the darker side of African-American culture- drugs, violence, criminality, poverty, nasty language, disrespect of women, anti-white message--Chappelle is promoting a way of life that many African-Americans feel is holding down their advancement in a mainstream, integrated society and reinforcing antiquated attitudes. You might say &quot;lighten up, stop being so pc&quot; but the fact remains that these images are not positive reinforcements of improved race relations but rather reinforcments of stereotypes and behavioral patterns that many feel-including Bill Cosby in a recent comment- are denigrating the advancement of Blacks in American society.It is an important series because it is prime evidence that that there is still a lot of work to do. And while there are people who mightt say that Dave Chappelle is the funny that Chris Rock always wanted to be but never succeeded in being, I will take Rock over Chappelle anytime for the simple reason that while Rock uses social commentary with conscience and says he hates &quot;N**gas&quot;, meaning the whole lifestyle and behavior as mentioned above (as Cosby more or less also has said), Chappelle revels in it and takes it all the way to the bank, lacking a conscience while promoting dangerous anti-social lifestyles in the process.",3,Positive messages?,1086480000,"06 6, 2004",2004,1446,"['Admittedly', 'show', 'often', 'times', 'hilarious', 'especially', 'are', 'inebriated', 'what', 'exactly', 'message', 'being', 'taught', 'here', 'playing', 'up', 'darker', 'side', 'African-American', 'culture-', 'drugs', 'violence', 'criminality', 'poverty', 'nasty', 'language', 'disrespect', 'women', 'anti-white', 'message', 'Chappelle', 'promoting', 'way', 'life', 'many', 'African-Americans', 'feel', 'holding', 'down', 'advancement', 'mainstream', 'integrated', 'society', 'reinforcing', 'antiquated', 'attitudes', 'might', 'say', 'quot', 'lighten', 'up', 'stop', 'being', 'pc', 'quot', 'fact', 'images', 'are', 'not', 'positive', 'reinforcements', 'improved', 'race', 'relations', 'rather', 'reinforcments', 'stereotypes', 'behavioral', 'patterns', 'many', 'feel-including', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'recent', 'comment-', 'are', 'denigrating', 'advancement', 'Blacks', 'American', 'society.It', 'important', 'series', 'prime', 'evidence', 'still', 'lot', 'work', 'do', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'mightt', 'say', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'funny', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'never', 'succeeded', 'being', 'will', 'take', 'Rock', 'Chappelle', 'anytime', 'simple', 'reason', 'Rock', 'social', 'commentary', 'conscience', 'quot', 'N**gas', 'quot', 'meaning', 'whole', 'lifestyle', 'behavior', 'mentioned', 'above', 'Cosby', 'more', 'less', 'also', 'said', 'Chappelle', 'way', 'bank', 'lacking', 'conscience', 'promoting', 'dangerous', 'anti-social', 'lifestyles', 'process']",Chappelle's Show - Season 1

If you know who Dave Chappelle is and if you find his stuff funny, you'll give this a look and you'll like it. If you don't know who he is and you are easily disgusted or sensetive, you won't like this at all.Other people have gone into detail about what sketches are good and which ones aren't; I gave the set 4 stars out of 5 because there are a few in there which were either too juvenile or just not funny enough for me. So far however, those have been in the minority, but it must be noted.Dave Chappelle is a very good comedian who has the potential to draw level with Chris Rock, who I think is the better of the two and is probably the best of the modern-day comedians (props to Bernie Mac, relase some albums and specials so I can compare you better man!). (...)Dave's social and relational commentary is just as good as Chris's, but you shouldn't have to pander. If it's his thing, then that's cool; but while it is funny, it's still low-brow. Maybe Chris Rock does the same thing, but I just notice it more with Chappelle.Still, give it a whirl, he's sure to make you laugh and he isn't a bad comedian at all.

I hardly knew who the guy was until the show started, and my opinion now is that Dave Chappelle is one of the funniest comedians alive today. His comedic brilliance comes from the fact that he &quot;keeps it real&quot;. He is so laid back and clearly knows what he is doing and loves doing it.The show is comprised of different skits, each hilarious in their own right.When the show first aired I knew it would probably be funny but I had no idea. Skits such as Tyrone the crackhead, Player Haters Ball, R.Kelly's Pee on You video all had me laughing harder than I have in a long time. While some people may think this is an immature show just remember it is sketch comedy designed only to entertain the viewer. And season 1 certainly served its purpose. As far as the DvD goes you get all the classic skits uncut, seeing them the way it was meant to be seen. Every episode is here. I am glad to now own dvd quality copies of skits like Popcopy, Great Moments in Hook-up History and History's Greatest Wars(that is started when one member of a gang steps on another one's sneakers and pours Morton salt all over him in a convenience store.classic.).Any fan of comedy should own this, as it will crack you up even after multiple viewings. Some of the musical acts were pretty good though and most of them were not included here. That is the only negative, and I hope they will include everything on the season 2 set.

796027,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B00018YCIM,Kenji Fujishima,"[8, 10]","I'll put it simply: hilarious stuff. Not all of the sketches work, and some of them are simply empty shock humor, but on the whole this is the CHAPPELLE'S SHOW season to remember (Season Two, on a whole, was not as good as this one, I think). Probably the best episode of the season is Episode 6, with two hilarious sketches: a hilarious spoof of &quot;Antwone Fisher&quot; starring Chappelle in his own jazzed-up life story; and an even funnier takeoff of MTV's &quot;Real World,&quot; in which a white guy is forced to live with five other crazy black people, with hilariously bad results. I just couldn't stop laughing throughout these two sketches! Other highlights of the season that come readily to my mind include Episode 1's controversial Clayton Bigsby sketch, the two sketches involving crackhead extraordinaire Tyrone Biggums (Episodes 2 &amp; 8), and the sketches in Episode 4 in which blacks finally get their reparations for slavery. Episode 9's &quot;Player Haters Ball&quot; sketch is a guilty pleasure of mine---sure, it relies too much on hollow insult humor, but the insults are sidesplitting. As for Episode 10's infamous skewering of R. Kelly...it's admittedly one-note, but it's funny too.I won't talk too much about what makes Dave Chappelle funny (since that would take away from the humor, now would it?). Suffice it to say, he tends to use a lot of the stereotypes of blacks that are prevalent in our society today, but exaggerates them to such a degree that it veers into hilarious parody---that is what gives his brand of sketch comedy its valuable and relevant edge.In short, if you want to see some smart TV humor, this 2-DVD set of the first season of CHAPPELLE'S SHOW will, for the most part, satisfy. It's not consistently funny, and some skits are smarter than others, but its high points are truly brilliant, and there is always something to laugh at in every episode. Unfortunately, some of the musical performances at the end of a good deal of the episodes have been cut (apparently due to rights issues), but I certainly don't watch these episodes for its music.

His education through his parents made him much richer than the slavery of a 4-year degree(and yes, I slaved for my degree that no matter how much business I got for portraits, murals, teaching calligraphy and cursive writings, no one EVER asked me, &#34;Where'd you go to school?&#34;--my talent would have been better served as an apprentice, but no one around me understood how to show me what could possibly be achieved independent of a university, like Chappelle's parents indirectly stimulated). Amazing how Comedy Central is STILL trying that spark that caused millions to tune in to his show and long after his show ended, it remained the #1 rated show on Comedy Central despite that.

Since then Dave-Mania has exploded, causing Dave to get his own sketch comedy show on Comedy Central appropriately titled ""Chappelle's Show"". Now I don't know if Dave is the primary writer of these skits, but whoever is, is an absolutely hilarous, and sickly demented. Dave's show is one that you can laugh with your friends, or by yourself, it doesn't really matter, because the show is so damn funny. Making fun of politics, culture and almost anything else you can imagine, Chappelle's show pushes the limit every episode and doesn't care who it offends.Season one has some of the best skits the show has done thus far, including spoofs of ""The Real World"" and ""Trading Places"". The characters and ideas are just so funny. You can't help but laugh. If you're uptight about crude humor, then this show is probably not for you. On Chappelle's show, no one and no race is safe. Don't take it personally, or you're going to miss the real comedy behind a lot of his opinions. I'm white and I don't take it seriously. I actually think it's very funny. The Extras including on the DVD are well worth buying, including commentary on episodes, deleted scenes, outtakes and more. The outtakes and deleted are by far the best piece of extras on here. Still episodes containing skits like ""Blackzilla"", ""The Mad Real World"", ""Trading Spouses"", Dave's version of Grand Theft Auto, ""Great Moments in Hook-up History"" and many more, you will not be dissapointed by this purchase.I can't wait til season two hits stores, but until that time, season one will hold me over.

This has got to be the best show to come out in the last year. My first Chappelle expierence was &quot;Half Baked&quot; (which I highly suggest you pick up) and I thought it was hilarious. And Dave wrote most of it. The thing that makes him so special is that he's not only funny; he's creative. I mean, c'mon. You have to be pretty damn creative to think of something like a black white supremisist and instead of making it bomb and offend everyone like it easily could have, you make it funny!Dave also writes the majority of his show (there's another guy too...ah, I can't remember his name), which is just fine with me. My favorites bits of Season 1 were the R. Kelly music video, the black white supremisist and the Mad Real World (which also contains one of my favorite quotes: &quot;You sit DOWN when you pee. I better not catch you standing up!&quot;). If a friend watched this, you'll find yourself quoting it and laughing about it all day. I mean, how many times has someone said &quot;I'm Rick James, b*tch&quot; or &quot;YEEEEEEEEEAH&quot; at your school?All I can say is that you need this if you consider yourself a person who likes to laugh.

Between Dave Chappelle's already brazen sense of humor and his show being aired on cable, the door has been left wide open for anything goes material and being as though this set is uncensored, it becomes even more evident that this show will not appeal to someone with some social justice axe to grind.

Nobody is spared.Each episode has it's high and low points but no matter how low the show might appear, another skit is right around the corner to pull the show above the competition.

That is why his shows, on and off air, have been so successful. Dave has a wide latitude of appeal and is loved adults by all ages, races and social statuses. His brand of twisted, real life humor is cutting, at times biting, but always funny.Sometimes the topic or language may be offensive to those with extremely thin skin or excessively tender sensitivities. But those same ones are offended by Mister Rogers, Oprah, Chris Farley, Bill Mahr, Fox News, KRS-One, pole dancing, professional sports, and everything in between! They just cannot be happy and live to be offended. I used to perform in a band with people like that. They seriously thought a shirt I often wore was offensive because it was camouflage colored. Morons!But if you are not in that category and you love a laugh that may be intellectual, witty, challenging and open-minded, you will find this series a welcome addition to your comedy collection.In my opinion, Chappelle should be revered as America's top adult-level comic. It is not for the young as some strong language, drug-references and Prince parodies are included.Chappelle has re-written human response to the age old challenge ""JUST WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?""

796090,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B00018YCIM,Wheelchair Assassin,"[8, 14]","With the scourge of political correctness maintaining its grip on American society, the sketch comedy of &quot;Chappelle's Show&quot; has come along at a very opportune time.  Dave Chappelle and his writers obviously take a great deal of pleasure in demolishing sacred cows, and Comedy Central's loose standards ensure that no taboo subject is off-limits.  And as an equal-opportunity offender, Dave ensures that his show can be enjoyed by anyone with a fully functioning sense of humor.  You may have to wade through some slow moments, but this debut season is still worth its relatively small price tag for comedy enthusiasts.&quot;Chappelle's Show&quot; makes heavy use of racial humor, and while part of me decries the double standard that allows a black comic to get away with jokes that would get a white guy pulled off the air in a matter of seconds, the other part of me can't help but laugh at some of what Dave comes up with.  He comes out firing in the very first episode with a newsmagazine piece on Clayton Bigsby, a vicious, blind white supremacist who's never been told a terrible secret: he's black.  Later on we're introduced to Tyrone Biggums, a not-quite-recovered crack addict who pays a visit to a local elementary school in order to scare a few kids straight.  In another brilliant drug-related bit, Dave advertises &quot;O'Dweed,&quot; a new strain of marijuana with the THC taken out for that family-friendly effect.There's plenty of fun with stereotypes to be found, as well.  It's not easy to deal with serious topics in a lighthearted manner, but &quot;Chappelle's Show&quot; may well do it better than any show to hit the airwaves since &quot;South Park.&quot; Episode four skewers the whole reparations-for-slavery debate with a look at what might actually happen if blacks ever get their money from the government.  &quot;The Mad Real World&quot; presents a terrifying vision of a lone white guy trapped in a house with six crazed black people.  And in perhaps the season's finest moment, the last episode's &quot;Trading Spouses&quot; skit, the show gives us a hilarious take on interracial relations when a white couple and a black couple swap wives and cameras are there to capture the shocking results.This isn't to say the show's perfect, or even close to it at this point.  There are still plenty of kinks to work out, as many promising skits go over the top or just don't go anywhere.  For every inspired idea like &quot;It's a Wonderful Chest,&quot; where a woman who resents her large chest gets a glimpse of what life would be like without it, there's an aimless waste of screen time like the painfully unfunny &quot;Blackzilla.&quot;  Like many new shows, this one is wildly inconsistent, and you have to wait through some dead moments to get to the good stuff.  The current season has shown a bit more direction, so some patience is definitely well-advised here.While there is some room for improvement, it should be kept in mind that &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;South Park&quot; weren't anything all that special in their first seasons either.  Dave's boldness and ambition are refreshing, even if he does occasionally fall short of his mark.  Hell, nowadays I'm just grateful to see something other than reality TV coming out.
