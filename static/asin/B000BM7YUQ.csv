While I'm not an amateur, I am a professional, Eric is a guitarist's guitarist. Anyone who thinks he don't need learnin' is a fool and only famous in his own little world, small as it may be. I'm not that arrogant.As Danny Gatton was known as the Humbler, Eric Johnson could rightly be called the Inspiration. What he does is not so much difficult as it is the epitome of finesse and transparency of technique. After viewing this, you will understand what I mean.I already know much of what Eric teaches in this session, for that is what it is, a private session (much like you might get at GIT), with a master at the top of his craft. But there is always something to learn even after repeated viewings. I even scanned in the booklet that comes with this so I can break the lessons down and blow up the individual charts for more easy reading.If you are serious about improving as a player, and if you're looking to be a real professional, you need to get this, if only to see what true professionalism looks and sounds like. The lessons are clear and focused. And with the booklet and the new ability to slow down the examples, you really can learn to play these things. But don't expect to sound like Eric (just as those who tried to, but could never sound like Jimi Hendrix).You are different and so will always sound different, and that's a plus. But the techniques and all that are included here are part of a ""must learn"" program you need to create and follow if you want to at least make a good living playing music.Learn from a master of melody and technique, where technique doesn't get in the way of the melody, but lives in service to the song -- the way it should be.I teach, too. And I recommend to any student who wants to grow that they should get this DVD. If you get no other, this would serve whatever style you choose to pursue, ultimately, because there is so much here that can be applied to virtually any style, whether it is Jazz, Country, Blues, Rock or even acoustic (which I wish he would have included a segment on that, my only kvetch).",5,"DVD's don't wear out, thankfully!",1140825600,"02 25, 2006",2006,2165,"['never', 'bought', 'VHS', 'tape', 'when', 'was', 'notified', 'would', 'be', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'ordered', ""'m"", 'not', 'amateur', 'am', 'professional', 'Eric', 'guitarist', 'guitarist', 'Anyone', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'learnin', 'fool', 'only', 'famous', 'own', 'little', 'world', 'small', 'may', 'be', ""'m"", 'not', 'arrogant.As', 'Danny', 'Gatton', 'was', 'known', 'Humbler', 'Eric', 'Johnson', 'could', 'rightly', 'be', 'called', 'Inspiration', 'What', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'difficult', 'epitome', 'finesse', 'transparency', 'technique', 'viewing', 'will', 'understand', 'what', 'mean.I', 'already', 'know', 'much', 'what', 'Eric', 'session', 'what', 'private', 'session', 'much', 'might', 'get', 'GIT', 'master', 'top', 'craft', 'always', 'something', 'learn', 'even', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'even', 'scanned', 'booklet', 'so', 'can', 'break', 'lessons', 'down', 'blow', 'up', 'individual', 'charts', 'more', 'easy', 'reading.If', 'are', 'serious', 'about', 'improving', 'player', ""'re"", 'looking', 'be', 'real', 'professional', 'need', 'get', 'only', 'see', 'what', 'true', 'professionalism', 'looks', 'sounds', 'lessons', 'are', 'clear', 'focused', 'booklet', 'new', 'ability', 'slow', 'down', 'examples', 'really', 'can', 'learn', 'play', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'sound', 'Eric', 'just', 'who', 'tried', 'could', 'never', 'sound', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'are', 'different', 'so', 'will', 'always', 'sound', 'different', 'plus', 'techniques', 'are', 'included', 'here', 'are', 'part', 'must', 'learn', 'program', 'need', 'create', 'follow', 'want', 'least', 'make', 'good', 'living', 'playing', 'music.Learn', 'master', 'melody', 'technique', 'where', 'technique', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'melody', 'service', 'song', 'way', 'should', 'be.I', 'teach', 'too', 'recommend', 'student', 'who', 'grow', 'should', 'get', 'DVD', 'get', 'other', 'would', 'serve', 'style', 'choose', 'pursue', 'ultimately', 'so', 'much', 'here', 'can', 'be', 'applied', 'virtually', 'style', 'Jazz', 'Country', 'Blues', 'Rock', 'even', 'acoustic', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'included', 'segment', 'only', 'kvetch']",N/A

944796,A238QHO7PIR3NI,B000BM7YUQ,"Mike M ""Mike M""","[2, 2]","I want to emphasize that this is not for beginners except for those who may be inspired by seeing and hearing a wide variety of possible techniques.With that said, it really seems to be geared toward the guitarist who has at least an intermediate skill level and is looking to explore new techniques or sharpen their playing.After a brief tune-up, Eric begins explaining and illustrating techniques of some of the guitarist who have inspired him (Hendrix, Clapton, Chet Atkins, Chuck Berry, .. etc). Eventually, he goes over his own techniques much of which are combinations of other techniqes and scales. He also includes GREAT and very detailed instruction on picking techniques.On most instruction, the picking hand and fretting hand are shown separately on a split screen and are easy to see. The DVD also has a number of exercises that can be played at normal or half speed with the ability to loop.While he really does a great job of describing and demonstrating the styles and techniques, he does not spend a whole lot of time going over them. He also breezes over certain parts rather quickly. Though this part will probably frustrate many beginners and players who want more time spent in that area, it is absolutely necessary to cover such a great amount of material. I also feel that this is one of the strong aspects as it allows intermediate and advanced players to quickly pick and play with new techniques without being bogged down by numbing repetition.What I love about this DVD is that it is so densely packed such a wide variety of techniques and absolutely beautiful playing.

Larsen,"[38, 40]","If you're reading this review and have checked out the DVD details you no doubtedly know who Eric Johnson is and know that he is simply the most amazing guitarist living or dead.Good news and bad news about this instructional video.  Good news: this is the entire VHS copy (with an awesome transfer of video and audio) plus they broke out the lessons in normal and 1/2 speed which you can set (with the DVD menus) to repeat over and over until you figure it out and play it smoothly.  Eric also does a great job explaining in detail what he wants to teach you while showing it.Bad news: after attempting to play what Eric Johnson plays so effortlessly you may soon realize that you're not as good as you once thought you were!  May make you want to quit and take up something like origami.  Or, this DVD could make you want to practice twice as much and pick up the signature Eric Johnson Strat and try to achieve his clean, pure tone and playing style.This DVD will show you his playing styles, how he gets his tone, lots of lessons on many styles of playing, we get to watch and listen to a couple of complete original songs (not found anywhere else), and watch Eric show lots of techniques he used on Ah Via Musicom (which hadn't been released when the tape was made) and Tones.Eric is simply friggin' amazing and for the first time, you get to sit with him and have him explain the stuff that makes him unique.  I highly suggest it to people who want to improve at playing guitar (all styles) as well as Eric Johnson fans who just appreciate his ability and want to see him in a private setting with just him solo with he strat.Every time I see Eric Johnson play, I realize how much I have yet to learn.  I wouldn't be surprised if he comes out with an instructional piano video as well after seeing his live acoustic tour a couple years ago.Thanks Eric...  you are amazing.
