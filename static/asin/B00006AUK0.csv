710520,A1KD8NJPZ01R37,B00006AUK0,doppelganger,"[12, 16]","There were too many cheerleading sessions guised as interviews with Rumsfeld and the other spectacle-eyed swagger sticks, but the overall video is decent, showing many aspects of the rebuilding efforts and documentation of the attack. Strategically, they did go into the Pentagon as a command structure and showed how it is basically a brain for the largest organization known to man (which is pretty cool). Some stuff about the original commision of the building, though not too much.The real disappointment was too much focus on the &quot;mindset&quot; of everyone, instead of taking you on an actual tour of the place. National Geographic tells you about millions of square feet, but seen is almost nothing. They do go inside boardrooms not normally allowing cameras (ooohh, ahhhh) and some other crevaces like the parking lot security office (after a suspicious manilla envelope is sighted on the grounds).What would have been INCREDIBLE, is if they had shown Pentagon Library, or any part of the virtual CITY that's underneath street level (there are reportedly more floors underneath than above). And I would like to have AT LEAST seen the inner courtyard. Or maybe a tour of the &quot;A-ring&quot;, inner-sanctum of the top dogs. Something other than a memorial for September and the whining of top generals that they need more more more. A bit of a dissappointment.",2,"Made in April 2002, decent, though too much focus on Sep. 11",1035072000,"10 20, 2002",2002,1373,"['were', 'too', 'many', 'cheerleading', 'sessions', 'guised', 'interviews', 'Rumsfeld', 'other', 'spectacle-eyed', 'swagger', 'sticks', 'overall', 'video', 'decent', 'showing', 'many', 'aspects', 'rebuilding', 'efforts', 'documentation', 'attack', 'Strategically', 'did', 'go', 'Pentagon', 'command', 'structure', 'showed', 'how', 'basically', 'brain', 'largest', 'organization', 'known', 'man', 'pretty', 'cool', 'stuff', 'original', 'commision', 'building', 'not', 'too', 'much.The', 'real', 'disappointment', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'quot', 'quot', 'everyone', 'instead', 'taking', 'actual', 'tour', 'place', 'National', 'Geographic', 'millions', 'square', 'feet', 'seen', 'almost', 'nothing', 'do', 'go', 'inside', 'boardrooms', 'not', 'normally', 'allowing', 'cameras', 'ooohh', 'ahhhh', 'other', 'crevaces', 'parking', 'lot', 'security', 'office', 'suspicious', 'manilla', 'envelope', 'sighted', 'grounds', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'INCREDIBLE', 'had', 'shown', 'Pentagon', 'Library', 'part', 'virtual', 'CITY', 'underneath', 'street', 'level', 'are', 'reportedly', 'more', 'floors', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'AT', 'LEAST', 'seen', 'inner', 'courtyard', 'maybe', 'tour', 'quot', 'A-ring', 'quot', 'inner-sanctum', 'top', 'dogs', 'Something', 'other', 'memorial', 'September', 'whining', 'top', 'generals', 'need', 'more', 'more', 'more', 'bit', 'dissappointment']",National Geographic Video - Inside the Pentagon

""Common Sense""","[0, 0]","`Inside The Pentagon' created in 2002 by N.G. after the Moslem Extremist attacks on September 11 2001 is a brief look at the history and straightforward contemporary observation in the strength of ordinary Americans doing extra ordinary things at the Pentagon. This documentary shows the historical facts in the strength of American Folks and American Leaders who work together as a Nation to destroy the enemy who seeks to destroy the United States. Listen to the voices of the people during this documentary and you as an American will be inspired and revitalized within the patriotic fabric of a great Nation.... If you don't walk away after watching this documentary with a historic understanding, unlike the person who considered this DVD a waste, well then you're like the others who've watched and except too many Michael Moore lies, listen to the rants of conspiracy theorists, celebrate with blind academic American hating propagandists, and embraced the BS indoctrination from left wing talking head liberal idiots.",5,Interestingly Wholesome,1305849600,"05 20, 2011",2011,1025,"['Pentagon', 'created', '2002', 'N.G', 'Moslem', 'Extremist', 'attacks', 'September', '11', '2001', 'brief', 'look', 'history', 'straightforward', 'contemporary', 'observation', 'strength', 'ordinary', 'Americans', 'doing', 'extra', 'ordinary', 'things', 'Pentagon', 'documentary', 'historical', 'facts', 'strength', 'American', 'Folks', 'American', 'Leaders', 'who', 'work', 'together', 'Nation', 'destroy', 'enemy', 'who', 'destroy', 'United', 'States', 'Listen', 'voices', 'people', 'documentary', 'American', 'will', 'be', 'inspired', 'revitalized', 'patriotic', 'fabric', 'great', 'Nation', 'do', ""n't"", 'walk', 'away', 'watching', 'documentary', 'historic', 'understanding', 'person', 'who', 'considered', 'DVD', 'waste', 'well', 'then', ""'re"", 'others', 'who', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'too', 'many', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'listen', 'rants', 'conspiracy', 'theorists', 'celebrate', 'blind', 'academic', 'American', 'hating', 'propagandists', 'embraced', 'BS', 'indoctrination', 'left', 'wing', 'talking', 'head', 'liberal', 'idiots']",National Geographic Video - Inside the Pentagon

Indeed, there is too much emphasis on 9/11, the proximity of the event being so close to the production time of this film. It gives some glimpse into the inner workings and the physical structure of the Pentagon, though as the previous reviewer pointed out classified areas underground are off limits, and the analysis is really lacking. Instead of analyzing the Pentagon in a broader political context, the film wraps it in the flag, but this was somewhat inevitable given the events of Sept. 11th. The Pentagon directly employs hundreds of thousands of people, only the Post office employs more -- almost a million workers now. And the Pentagon is responsible for indirectly employing millions of others as defense contractors and subcontractors. It is the nerve center of the military - industrial complex and a bastion of America's defense against enemies, whose number seemed to have increased since the end of the Cold War.I am hopeful, however, that just as with the Cold War, the Pentagon will be instrumental in getting us successfully past our current hurdles.",4,Pentagon,1070323200,"12 2, 2003",2003,1190,"['was', 'planning', 'write', 'review', 'couple', 'months', 'reviewer', 'Chicago', 'really', 'stole', 'thunder', 'Indeed', 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', '9/11', 'proximity', 'event', 'being', 'so', 'close', 'production', 'time', 'film', 'glimpse', 'inner', 'workings', 'physical', 'structure', 'Pentagon', 'though', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'classified', 'areas', 'underground', 'are', 'limits', 'analysis', 'really', 'lacking', 'Instead', 'analyzing', 'Pentagon', 'broader', 'political', 'context', 'film', 'flag', 'was', 'somewhat', 'inevitable', 'given', 'events', 'Sept.', '11th', 'Pentagon', 'directly', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'people', 'only', 'Post', 'office', 'more', 'almost', 'million', 'workers', 'now', 'Pentagon', 'responsible', 'indirectly', 'employing', 'millions', 'others', 'defense', 'contractors', 'subcontractors', 'nerve', 'center', 'military', 'industrial', 'complex', 'bastion', 'America', 'defense', 'enemies', 'number', 'seemed', 'have', 'increased', 'end', 'Cold', 'War.I', 'am', 'hopeful', 'however', 'just', 'Cold', 'War', 'Pentagon', 'will', 'be', 'instrumental', 'getting', 'successfully', 'current', 'hurdles']",National Geographic Video - Inside the Pentagon
