956702,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B000CCW2O8,Andrew Desmond,"[2, 2]","""Separate Lies"" is a film about infidelities, indiscretions and the manner in which individuals go about covering their tracks.  It is with these types of films that the British typically excel.As is often the case, once a lie is made, others inevitably follow.  Very soon, an entire web of deceit has been constructed.  Lies beget lies.This is a very good film that deserves a wider audience than it will probably receive.  I suspect it will be pigeon holed as art house.  Such films rarely become box office hits.  This is a shame as quality is too often overwhelmed by special effects, car chases and firearms.If I was to find criticism with ""Separate Lies"" it is that the one of the main characters is simply too calm in the face of challenge to be truly plausible.  When the cheated husband, otherwise played brilliantly by Tom Wilkinson, learns of his wife's infidelities, he is briefly shocked but, thereafter, seems untroubled.  When further infidelities occur, he is simply too poker faced to be believed.  There is little outrage and little anger.  Would someone really be this calm?  I suspect not.Having found a weakness in the film, I still recommend it as worthy.  The settings are marvellous and with exception of the above criticism, the characters are far more true to life than the typical fare from Hollywood.  Take the trouble to see this film.",4,Lies Beget Lies,1150156800,"06 13, 2006",2006,1364,"['Separate', 'Lies', 'film', 'infidelities', 'indiscretions', 'manner', 'individuals', 'go', 'covering', 'tracks', 'types', 'films', 'British', 'typically', 'excel.As', 'often', 'case', 'once', 'lie', 'made', 'others', 'inevitably', 'follow', 'Very', 'soon', 'entire', 'web', 'deceit', 'been', 'constructed', 'beget', 'lies.This', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'wider', 'audience', 'will', 'probably', 'receive', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', 'pigeon', 'holed', 'art', 'house', 'Such', 'films', 'rarely', 'become', 'box', 'office', 'hits', 'shame', 'quality', 'too', 'often', 'overwhelmed', 'special', 'effects', 'car', 'chases', 'firearms.If', 'was', 'find', 'criticism', 'Separate', 'Lies', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'simply', 'too', 'calm', 'face', 'challenge', 'be', 'truly', 'plausible', 'When', 'cheated', 'husband', 'otherwise', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'wife', 'infidelities', 'briefly', 'shocked', 'thereafter', 'untroubled', 'When', 'further', 'infidelities', 'occur', 'simply', 'too', 'poker', 'faced', 'be', 'believed', 'little', 'outrage', 'little', 'anger', 'Would', 'someone', 'really', 'be', 'calm', 'suspect', 'not.Having', 'found', 'weakness', 'film', 'still', 'recommend', 'worthy', 'settings', 'are', 'marvellous', 'exception', 'above', 'criticism', 'characters', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'true', 'life', 'typical', 'fare', 'Hollywood', 'Take', 'trouble', 'see', 'film']",N/A
956703,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000CCW2O8,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I wish that this film had just been crafted a little better.  That's all I really have to say about it.  It is a decent film with some ravishing performances, but overall it fails to ignite like it should have.That said, Tom Wilkinson is simply breathtaking.The film revolves around the life of a British couple, James and Anne, who have their relationship turned on its head when a family friend is killed in a hit-and-run.  Tom, a headstrong business man, is certain he knows who is responsible, but Anne is harboring a secret that will make his suspicions seem futile.  When murder is only half of the equation you know that any and all `revelations' are going to be painful.I think the biggest fault to be found here is with the pacing.  The script, or at least the plot, is rather engaging and commanding on its own, but the way that it is laced together is a distraction.  The film as a whole lacks any real bite.  It just kind of floats there.  The first half of the film, while generally superbly acted, is kind of a bore.  It picks up as the second half of the film gets into full swing, but it never truly recovers from the lackluster opening.For the most part the acting is phenomenal.  Wilkinson and Watson are stunning as the two leads.  Rupert Everett borders on awful for me.  He is too obvious and I found his acting style to be over-the-top and distracting.  He was somewhat of a caricature.  Watson is subtle and natural will ease, completely understanding her character's inner working.  The way she shifts ever so slightly when being backed into a wall by her husband is astonishing.  Wilkinson (one of my favorite actors EVER) is a revelation here.There is a scene, where Watson's character Anne makes a confession, which serves as the best scene of emotional unraveling in the film.  For both Watson and Wilkinson (especially Wilkinson) this is a goldmine scene.  The sharp burst of aggression from Watson, the way she uses her confined energy to distract from her final blow.  The way Wilkinson loses his commanding faade, excusing himself to vomit all over the floor and then attempting to recover any dignity he can.  The way that both actors took the scene and played it straight, resisting the usual `scene chewing' for a more natural and accurate depiction of the characters they were playing, never once losing the `collected' mannerisms of James and Anne.I recommend this film for the acting alone.  I mean, as a whole the film misses the boat.  It needed a stronger directorial hand to handle the films core.  It just seems to fall apart and lose itself in the direction.  That said, Watson and Wilkinson (and a fragile and memorable Linda Bassett) do salvage the film the best they can and serve as very good reasons to see the film regardless of the overall package.",3,"The film is lackluster, but the lead performances are beyond stunning...",1271635200,"04 19, 2010",2010,2799,"['wish', 'film', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'crafted', 'little', 'better', 'really', 'have', 'say', 'decent', 'film', 'ravishing', 'performances', 'overall', 'ignite', 'should', 'have.That', 'said', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'simply', 'breathtaking.The', 'film', 'revolves', 'life', 'British', 'couple', 'James', 'Anne', 'who', 'have', 'relationship', 'turned', 'head', 'when', 'family', 'friend', 'killed', 'hit-and-run', 'Tom', 'headstrong', 'business', 'man', 'certain', 'who', 'responsible', 'Anne', 'harboring', 'secret', 'will', 'make', 'suspicions', 'seem', 'futile', 'When', 'murder', 'only', 'half', 'equation', 'know', 'revelations', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'painful.I', 'think', 'biggest', 'fault', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'pacing', 'script', 'least', 'plot', 'rather', 'engaging', 'commanding', 'own', 'way', 'laced', 'together', 'distraction', 'film', 'whole', 'real', 'bite', 'just', 'kind', 'floats', 'there', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'generally', 'superbly', 'acted', 'kind', 'bore', 'up', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'full', 'swing', 'never', 'truly', 'recovers', 'lackluster', 'opening.For', 'most', 'part', 'acting', 'phenomenal', 'Wilkinson', 'Watson', 'are', 'stunning', 'two', 'leads', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'borders', 'awful', 'too', 'obvious', 'found', 'acting', 'style', 'be', 'over-the-top', 'distracting', 'was', 'somewhat', 'caricature', 'Watson', 'subtle', 'natural', 'will', 'ease', 'completely', 'understanding', 'character', 'inner', 'working', 'way', 'shifts', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'when', 'being', 'backed', 'wall', 'husband', 'astonishing', 'Wilkinson', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'EVER', 'revelation', 'scene', 'where', 'Watson', 'character', 'Anne', 'confession', 'best', 'scene', 'emotional', 'unraveling', 'film', 'Watson', 'Wilkinson', 'especially', 'Wilkinson', 'goldmine', 'scene', 'sharp', 'burst', 'aggression', 'Watson', 'way', 'confined', 'energy', 'distract', 'final', 'blow', 'way', 'Wilkinson', 'commanding', 'faade', 'excusing', 'vomit', 'floor', 'then', 'attempting', 'recover', 'dignity', 'can', 'way', 'actors', 'took', 'scene', 'played', 'straight', 'resisting', 'usual', 'scene', 'chewing', 'more', 'natural', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'characters', 'were', 'playing', 'never', 'once', 'losing', 'collected', 'mannerisms', 'James', 'Anne.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'acting', 'alone', 'mean', 'whole', 'film', 'boat', 'needed', 'stronger', 'directorial', 'hand', 'handle', 'films', 'core', 'just', 'fall', 'apart', 'lose', 'direction', 'said', 'Watson', 'Wilkinson', 'fragile', 'memorable', 'Linda', 'Bassett', 'do', 'salvage', 'film', 'best', 'can', 'serve', 'very', 'good', 'reasons', 'see', 'film', 'regardless', 'overall', 'package']",N/A

The more you think about it, the more it offers.You have to figure that any film that begins with this cast and this director has something to offer.  This much talent all in one place could make a movie about a bus tour gone awry something worth watching.Admittedly at the film's conclusion, I had a feeling of ""Now, what was that really all about?""  Well, it was all about human nature and introspection.Though something of a control freak, Manning is a good person who had been cuckolded by the wife he adored and the neighborhood sociopathic heir to the manor.  At the end he should have felt all right about leaving her to her fate.  But he didn't.  Love wins out over logic, as it often does.  And whether we agree with him or not, it's his life, isn't it?And Anne--well, any woman (and probably any man) who has ever fallen under the romantic spell of a sociopath can understand the dilemma she was in.  She is admirable in the way that she demands to take responsibility for her own actions and decisions, even against the wishes of those she holds nearest and dearest.  She thinks she loves the sociopath because he demands nothing of her, in contrast to her husband whom she feels constantly sets standards she cannot met.  She probably mentioned this in her first conversation with Billy Buel, thereby giving him the tool he needed to hook her.One of the easiest characters to overlook is Maggie, who has the golden opportunity for revenge against the person who once did her so great a wrong, then has to weigh that against the pain she will cause the one person who changed her fate for the better.In all the well-constructed morass of tangled emotions and motives in this film, Billy the sociopath is actually the surprising safe haven for the viewer.  He lives only for himself, and he lacks a single redeeming quality, so we can hate, hiss and boo him to our heart's content.  Thanks, Rupert Everett, for doing so well the very tough job of portraying a souless individual as souless.This is a very fine film--a good story portrayed by a great group of cinema professionals.

An adulterous affair complicates the plot, and the movie explores the resulting anguish of the participants.At the beginning of this review I stated that the movie is a semi-thriller. The three main characters are involved in events that cause an increasing state of tension as the movie progresses, but I really feel that the director wasn't trying to make a thriller at all. The emotional struggles of the the trio are what's really important. One reviewer commented that the movie dragged. When I watched it I marveled at the tight editing of the movie.

956713,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000CCW2O8,Grady Harp,"[25, 26]","Nigel Balchin's maze-like novel 'A Way Through the Wood' has been adapted by Julian Fellowes who also directs this 'terribly British' drawing room suspense piece. It is a film whose effect relies on the cast portraying the varyingly benign/malignant characters and it is here that Fellowes' directorial choices are superb. The story has a linear line that is easy to follow, but the beauty of the film is the metamorphosis of each player as a single incident ignites a minefield of disasters.James Manning (Tom Wilkinson) is a successful business obsessed solicitor in London, married to Anne (Emily Watson) who needs more in her life: the couple being childless live in the country in a beautiful estate, assisted by their long term 'cleaner' Maggie (Linda Bassett). They attend social outings and meet, among others, William Bule (Rupert Everett), the passively lazy wealthy neighbor.  Anne decides they should entertain their neighbors and against gruff James' protestation Anne proceeds with planning: James arranges to 'not attend due to business'. On the night of the party there is a hit and run accident in which Maggie's husband is accidentally killed by someone in a Range Rover (she observed).  When James returns home he sees a scratch on William's Range Rover and suspects William to be the perpetrator.  Anne discourages James from going to the police with the information -'what possible good can it do but ruin Bill's life as a socialite and father and son of an important scion?'.  From this first 'lie' the virus spreads: James confronts Bill who talks James out of going to the police, Anne confesses it was she who was driving Bill's Rover and is the one responsible, James convinces Anne to keep it quiet because it would ruin his reputation, Anne confesses she is having an affair with Bill, and the three of them concur that they will stick together on their big lie for the sake of the greater good.  Anne eventually succumbs to the guilt of not telling her beloved Maggie that she is the one responsible and Maggie, herself guilty of a previous theft whose life was saved by Anne's mercy to hire her anyway, is the agent who draws the story to its surprising conclusion.  Lies begat lies that begat lies, et cetera.The major impact of this intrigue is the manner in which the isolated tragedy impacts each of the characters involved.  Each changes in a dramatic way.  Tome Wilkinson gives the finest performance of a career filled with brilliant performances: he is able to say more with his posture and facial expressions than about any actor before the audience today.  Likewise the gifted Emily Watson adds yet another fine role to her repertoire as does the surprisingly smarmy Rupert Everett who, despite being yet another wealthy British 'gentleman', gives us a man both arid of spirit and yet ultimately needy.  And the always-fine Linda Bassett takes a small role and finesses it making her character quietly central to the chaotic web of lies.The cinematography by Tony Pierce-Roberts and the musical score by Stanislas Syrewicz add immeasurably to the multiple atmospheres the story encounters.  This is ensemble playing at its finest, which always means that the director (Julian Fellowes) has a fine grasp on the piece.

This movie, though, is dreadful.This movie doesn't fail in the performance of the actors; it fails in its story.  Movie audiences need a protagonist they can empathize with, but it's very difficult to understand how Wilkonson's character, James, tolerates as much from his wife as he does.  Anne explains to her husband why she has her affair, but that's all it is for the audience, exposition--we see nothing that makes her the least bit sympathetic or understandable.  You get the feeling the the filmmaker is trying to be fair to her, kind, even, but she comes off as whiny and self-centered--and not in ways that are interesting.Because Watson's character is so uttery unlikeable--and Everett's, too--James becomes a frustrating and arguably an unlikeable character in his passivity.The movie is described as supenseful on the DVD box, but it wasn't.

This lovely little tale is very reminiscent of those movies of the eighties with their obsession with class in Britain yet here the focus is on the upper middle class and the aristocracy rather than the interactions of the polyocracy and working class Londoners.The outset of the film sees a middle aged cyclist taking a moderate rate down a country lane whereupon he is hit by a speeding vehicle. There follows a tale of disintegrating lives and values which gradually engulf the characters in a web of less than pretty lies. At the heart of the story is the fragile marriage of a successful city solicitor (attorney) in London with a rural retreat provided by his not insubstantial income. His wife, good dutiful soul that she is, plays out her life as a consort to her man and abides by his rules yet yearns to be free. Her entangtlement with the son of a nearby aristocrat develops as she persues him from an initial meeting at a local cricket game but this soon involves all in the village including a former housekeeper who previously worked for his family and now for her but who is the widow of the deceased cyclist.It is hard to understand how the solicitor goes against years of professional training to protect his wife as he gradually unfolds the infidelity and criminal neglect which he discovers about her actions and the extent to which he desires to conceal her role while at the same time takes no action against her lover. The plot slowly develops as the police become involved and seem to make little progress in their investigations as the tangled web and tissue of lies becomes evermore tangled and convuluted.This slow paced story is redeemed by the growing awareness of the main players of their inter-relationships and interdependency. As the plot unfolds they each secure a different type of freedom and individual development which ultimately results in their own individual fulfillment as people including the widow which also affects minor elements. Salvation is at hand at the end but one which results from suffering and the implications are there for all to see. The delicate way in which the class relationships are explored is one which will engender some dissatisfaction with those not accustomed to dealing with the skeletal framework of class in Britain which still occupies much work despite almost ten years of Blairist meritocracy following on from the apparent bloody competitiveness of the Thatcher era. but fear not, the class system is alive and .well and living in rural Buckinghamshire. Whilst the location and classes may significantly differ from Sammy and Rosie there are many parallels between the two and whereas Sammy and Rosie is in your face class conflict, Separate Lies is a much more low key sophisticated treatment.All in all a pleasant little sojourn into a gritties Midsommer Murder Mystery with great performances by all of the cast but ultimately there is a feeling, a residual dissatisfaction, with the whole premiss of the disintegrating moral stance of the solicitor despite his strong sense of right and wrong which detracts from the story.",3,True Lies,1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,3259,"['favourite', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'Channel', 'Four', 'Four', 'series', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'yet', 'somehow', 'Sammy', 'Rosie', 'Get', 'Laid', 'sticks', 'mind', 'here', 'lovely', 'little', 'tale', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'movies', 'eighties', 'obsession', 'class', 'Britain', 'yet', 'here', 'focus', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'aristocracy', 'rather', 'interactions', 'polyocracy', 'working', 'class', 'Londoners.The', 'outset', 'film', 'middle', 'aged', 'cyclist', 'taking', 'moderate', 'rate', 'down', 'country', 'lane', 'hit', 'speeding', 'vehicle', 'tale', 'disintegrating', 'lives', 'values', 'gradually', 'characters', 'web', 'less', 'pretty', 'heart', 'story', 'fragile', 'marriage', 'successful', 'city', 'solicitor', 'attorney', 'London', 'rural', 'retreat', 'provided', 'not', 'insubstantial', 'income', 'wife', 'good', 'dutiful', 'soul', 'out', 'life', 'consort', 'man', 'abides', 'rules', 'yet', 'yearns', 'be', 'free', 'entangtlement', 'son', 'nearby', 'aristocrat', 'initial', 'meeting', 'local', 'cricket', 'game', 'soon', 'village', 'including', 'former', 'housekeeper', 'who', 'previously', 'worked', 'family', 'now', 'who', 'widow', 'deceased', 'cyclist.It', 'hard', 'understand', 'how', 'solicitor', 'years', 'professional', 'training', 'protect', 'wife', 'gradually', 'infidelity', 'criminal', 'neglect', 'actions', 'extent', 'conceal', 'role', 'same', 'time', 'action', 'lover', 'plot', 'slowly', 'police', 'become', 'involved', 'seem', 'make', 'little', 'progress', 'investigations', 'tangled', 'web', 'tissue', 'lies', 'becomes', 'evermore', 'tangled', 'convuluted.This', 'slow', 'paced', 'story', 'redeemed', 'growing', 'awareness', 'main', 'players', 'inter-relationships', 'interdependency', 'plot', 'secure', 'different', 'type', 'freedom', 'individual', 'development', 'ultimately', 'results', 'own', 'individual', 'fulfillment', 'people', 'including', 'widow', 'also', 'minor', 'elements', 'Salvation', 'hand', 'end', 'one', 'results', 'suffering', 'implications', 'are', 'there', 'see', 'delicate', 'way', 'class', 'relationships', 'are', 'explored', 'one', 'will', 'engender', 'dissatisfaction', 'not', 'accustomed', 'dealing', 'skeletal', 'framework', 'class', 'Britain', 'still', 'much', 'work', 'almost', 'ten', 'years', 'Blairist', 'meritocracy', 'following', 'apparent', 'bloody', 'competitiveness', 'Thatcher', 'era', 'fear', 'not', 'class', 'system', 'alive', '.well', 'living', 'rural', 'Buckinghamshire', 'Whilst', 'location', 'classes', 'may', 'significantly', 'differ', 'Sammy', 'Rosie', 'are', 'many', 'parallels', 'two', 'whereas', 'Sammy', 'Rosie', 'face', 'class', 'conflict', 'Separate', 'Lies', 'much', 'more', 'low', 'key', 'sophisticated', 'treatment.All', 'pleasant', 'little', 'sojourn', 'gritties', 'Midsommer', 'Murder', 'Mystery', 'great', 'performances', 'cast', 'ultimately', 'feeling', 'residual', 'dissatisfaction', 'whole', 'premiss', 'disintegrating', 'moral', 'stance', 'solicitor', 'strong', 'sense', 'right', 'wrong', 'story']",N/A

956717,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000CCW2O8,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","Last week I was watching the episode of ""American Idol"" where the judges tell the guys and gals who has made it to the dozen of each gender who get to compete for the ""final"" twelve spots (i.e., the ones who get to go on tour).  The most dramatic moment came when Mandisa, who watched the audition show where she tried out and heard what Simon Cowell had to say about her weight after she left the room, had a chance to confront him.  The gist of her remarks to him was that she was hurt by what he had said, but that she had forgiven him and that her apology was not dependent on his apology, which he eventually got around to making.  A couple of weeks ago Shaquille O'Neal, after a talk with Bill Russell about how hate is not a necessary element to competition, talked to Kobe Bryant for the first time since they went their separate ways.  The common denominator to the two stories is that living with hate is not a way to live and that letting things go is the good way to go.  ""Separate Lies"" comes to a similar conclusion and reinforces the lessons I have been seeing in recent weeks.Before we get to the title of the film a man on a bicycle is clipped by a car and thrown to the side of the road.  This fleeting incident has a profound impact on James Manning (Tom Wilkinson), a solicitor who lives near that country lane with his wife, Anne (Emily Watson).  The man who died was the husband of their housekeeper, which makes it rather personal for James and when he sees a mark on the car driven by William Bule (Rupert Everett), a friend of Anne's he becomes suspicious and confronts William, who eventually admits to the deed.  But when William tells Anne what has happened she has a confession of her own to make that changes everything for William and turns his world upside down.  The tragedy is that no matter what he does, it seems James cannot make things right.My main insight to this 2005 film by Julian Fellow (writer of ""Gosford Park""), who wrote the adaptation of Nigel Balchin's novel ""A Way Through the Wood,"" was the character of William because even though he is played by Rupert Everett there is no obvious reason for Anne or anybody else to find him preferable to James.  After all, William only has a vague idea as to how old his two sons might be, makes no effort to act charming, and is wholly indifferent to having killed someone.  The only thing that seems to recommend William is that he is not James; specifically, James is always providing tests for Anne that she fails and William simply does not care enough not to trust her.  While Anne says the right things as they try to make things work, her actions indicate she is leading a separate life.  James surrenders to the inevitable, and finds a personal grace note that allows him to continue.Wilkinson's performance is at the heart of this film and he presents James as a man who is not comfortable when he is not in control, especially when it is made clear to him he has not been in control for some time and that security is never coming back again.  Watson matches him in terms of quiet intensity, because while voices might be raised it would not be proper to be screaming.  Would anger and the attendant passion have made a difference earlier, or were they doomed from the moment they settled on the life of living in the country but James working in the city?  The fissures in this marriage had been covered up by dust long before this movie started.",4,"Separate lies, separate lives, separate loves, seperate...",1140566400,"02 22, 2006",2006,3447,"['Last', 'week', 'was', 'watching', 'episode', 'American', 'Idol', 'where', 'judges', 'tell', 'guys', 'gals', 'who', 'made', 'dozen', 'gender', 'who', 'get', 'compete', 'final', 'twelve', 'spots', 'i.e.', 'ones', 'who', 'get', 'go', 'tour', 'most', 'dramatic', 'moment', 'came', 'when', 'Mandisa', 'who', 'watched', 'audition', 'show', 'where', 'tried', 'out', 'heard', 'what', 'Simon', 'Cowell', 'had', 'say', 'weight', 'left', 'room', 'had', 'chance', 'confront', 'gist', 'remarks', 'was', 'was', 'hurt', 'what', 'had', 'said', 'had', 'forgiven', 'apology', 'was', 'not', 'dependent', 'apology', 'eventually', 'got', 'making', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'Shaquille', ""O'Neal"", 'talk', 'Bill', 'Russell', 'how', 'hate', 'not', 'necessary', 'element', 'competition', 'talked', 'Kobe', 'Bryant', 'first', 'time', 'went', 'separate', 'ways', 'common', 'denominator', 'two', 'stories', 'living', 'hate', 'not', 'way', 'live', 'letting', 'things', 'go', 'good', 'way', 'go', 'Separate', 'Lies', 'similar', 'conclusion', 'lessons', 'have', 'been', 'seeing', 'recent', 'weeks.Before', 'get', 'title', 'film', 'man', 'bicycle', 'clipped', 'car', 'thrown', 'side', 'road', 'fleeting', 'incident', 'profound', 'impact', 'James', 'Manning', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'solicitor', 'who', 'country', 'wife', 'Anne', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'man', 'who', 'died', 'was', 'husband', 'housekeeper', 'rather', 'personal', 'James', 'when', 'mark', 'car', 'driven', 'William', 'Bule', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'friend', 'Anne', 'suspicious', 'confronts', 'William', 'who', 'eventually', 'deed', 'when', 'William', 'Anne', 'what', 'happened', 'confession', 'own', 'make', 'changes', 'everything', 'William', 'world', 'upside', 'down', 'tragedy', 'matter', 'what', 'James', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'things', 'right.My', 'main', 'insight', '2005', 'film', 'Julian', 'Fellow', 'writer', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'who', 'wrote', 'adaptation', 'Nigel', 'Balchin', 'novel', 'Way', 'Wood', 'was', 'character', 'William', 'even', 'played', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'obvious', 'reason', 'Anne', 'anybody', 'else', 'find', 'preferable', 'James', 'William', 'only', 'vague', 'idea', 'how', 'old', 'two', 'sons', 'might', 'be', 'effort', 'act', 'charming', 'wholly', 'indifferent', 'having', 'killed', 'someone', 'only', 'thing', 'recommend', 'William', 'not', 'James', 'specifically', 'James', 'always', 'providing', 'tests', 'Anne', 'William', 'simply', 'not', 'care', 'enough', 'not', 'trust', 'Anne', 'right', 'things', 'try', 'make', 'things', 'work', 'actions', 'indicate', 'leading', 'separate', 'life', 'James', 'surrenders', 'inevitable', 'personal', 'grace', 'note', 'continue.Wilkinson', 'performance', 'heart', 'film', 'James', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'comfortable', 'when', 'not', 'control', 'especially', 'when', 'made', 'clear', 'not', 'been', 'control', 'time', 'security', 'never', 'coming', 'back', 'again', 'Watson', 'terms', 'quiet', 'intensity', 'voices', 'might', 'be', 'raised', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'proper', 'be', 'screaming', 'Would', 'anger', 'attendant', 'passion', 'have', 'made', 'difference', 'earlier', 'were', 'doomed', 'moment', 'settled', 'life', 'living', 'country', 'James', 'working', 'city', 'fissures', 'marriage', 'had', 'been', 'covered', 'up', 'dust', 'long', 'before', 'movie', 'started']",N/A

956719,A2MF2QVSCUI27G,B000CCW2O8,"Luan Gaines ""luansos""","[5, 5]","In this quietly powerful movie, a profoundly moral man is faced with a terrible decision, one that becomes increasingly complicated as the story evolves. Successful solicitor James Manning (Tom Wilkinson) has always followed a strict moral code, one that chafes on his all-too-mortal wife, Anne (Emily Watson), who believes he sets impossibly high standards that she will always fail. Attracted to a divorced heir recently returned to the English countryside, the charming, if jaded Billy Bule (Rupert Everett), Anne allows herself to be seduced. Returning home to host a cocktail party after a couple of drinks with Billy while her husband is in London on business, Anne and Billy are involved in a hit and run accident. The victim is Mr. Pierce, the husband of the Manning's housekeeper.Manning's determined pursuit of the perpetrator leads to unexpected revelations, the most devastating that his wife was driving the vehicle in question. Suddenly the solution becomes personal and Manning's reputation and marriage is on the line, not to mention his anxiety for Anne's well-being. Surprisingly, it is Anne who cannot bear her own failings, riddled with guilt, not because of the affair she fails to end, but because of her betrayal of the widow, Mrs. Pierce, who refuses to believe Anne is at fault in spite of her abject confession. It is the housekeeper's forgiveness that shames them all, freeing them to attend to the business of living, the Manning's attempt to heal a flawed marriage: ""She was tired of feeling guilty, so in the end she stayed."" When Billy is diagnosed with terminal cancer, Anne fails her husband once more, leaving to minister to the man she loves, the torrid affair turned more tender by necessity.The juxtaposition of emotions is delicate and thoughtful, the weight of personal guilt palpable, especially for Manning, who is so finely tuned to his moral compass, the one impediment to a successful marriage with a faithless woman. Ultimately, Bule dies and the Manning's come to terms with their loss of one another, moving on to separate lives, but with the peace of having gone from anger and resentment to a common forgiveness.

For all intents and purposes based on the first 10 minutes, ""Separate Lies"" could have been set in 1915.But then Rupert Everett shows up as William Bule and we are thrust forward 90 years in a matter of seconds as he insinuates himself into the plot and the marriage of James and Anne Manning (a mannered and slightly off her game, Emily Watson and an excellent Tom Wilkinson...when is someone going to mount a production of ""Death of a Salesman""  for this guy?)We are in the infidelity arena in ""Separate Lies"" and no one makes a film about infidelity like the Brits: think ""Damage"" with the terrific trio of Jeremy Irons, Juliette Binoche and Rupert Graves and the now almost forgotten, ""Betrayal"" (shamefully only available on VHS) with Irons again, Patricia Hodge and Ben Kingsley. Unfortunately, ""Separate Lies"" is neither up to the task nor the excellent quality of these two films.Though the action gets more intriguing and interesting  as the movie moves towards its ambiguous and ironic denouement, the film loses steam as a punctured balloon loses air and deflates and this can only be blamed on the flaccid editing.Rupert Everett's icy, loose and entitled performance is a great foil for Wilkinson's sweaty, worried and jittery performance:  their scenes together crackle with wit and fire.The almost always excellent Watson's Anne is problematic. She doesn't seem to grasp the core of her character and her performance is at times right on and at others, not.""Separate Lies"" is a good not a great film.

He's a successful solictor; she is the wife who wants to please him at the cost of her own happiness.  When the husband of their housekeeper is killed by a hit and run driver, events are set in motion that will change their lives.The movie doesn't have enough suspense to be a thriller, but it does examine what one might do to protect a loved one and/or their reputation.  Wilkinson and Watson are superb in their roles, both showing a wide range of conflicting emotions.  Rupert Everett, looking rather ill, does a good job in his underplayed role of their neighbor William Buell.SEPARATE LIES is not a great film by any means; it's lethargic and the second half meanders a lot.

956722,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000CCW2O8,mirasreviews,"[1, 1]","""Separate Lies"" is a relationship drama loosely adapted from Nigel Balchin's novel ""A Way Through the Wood"" by writer and director Julian Fellowes. No life its perfect. So says James Manning (Tom Wilkinson), who appears to have the perfect life. He's a wealthy solicitor with a younger wife, Anne (Emily Watson), who divides his time between a lovely country home in Buckinghamshire and a smart London townhouse. Unbeknownst to James, Anne is exhausted by her husband's unrelenting high expectations and precisely ordered life. She finds relief, of sorts, in the arms of pompous, aloof neighbor Bill Bule (Rupert Everett). When a hit-and-run accident kills the husband of their housekeeper Maggie (Linda Bassett), James suspects that Bill was the driver. But James' sleuthing uncovers some painful truths about his own life.The drama presents itself as a lovers triangle plot buoyed by complex character writing, attention to detail, and great performances. Self-satisfied James, quietly frustrated Anne, insufferable Bill, and a car accident could easily make a neurotic melodrama.  ""Separate Lies"" has a few of those moments, but it's tone is overwhelmingly genuine. The story is primarily about James, and Tom Wilkinson delivers one of the best performances of the year. James' smugness, his introversion, his frustration at his wife's infidelity and distaste at having to conspire with her obnoxious lover come through powerfully with so few words. The car accident is a catalyst, but it separates this film from many others of its kind in my mind, because it creates a real problem for the characters. They are not just motivated by happiness or misery or various neuroses. Someone has died, and others could go to prison. Lives will be destroyed. The fact that these people suddenly have a real problem, not just malaise, makes their actions comprehensible and sympathetic. ""Separate Lies"" has a mercifully unromantic view of love and sex, which are peripheral to the wide gamut of emotions, choices, and consequences that these 3 characters experience.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006): This is a 2-sided disc, with full screen version on one side and widescreen on the other. There is a theatrical trailer (2 min) and a good audio commentary by writer/director Julian Fellowes. Fellowes delvers a spirited, comprehensive analysis of the film, commenting on locations, sets, characters, story, themes. He takes us through the story, his intentions, and what is going on with the characters, scene-by scene. There  is  a lot of information in the commentary, and it would make a great study guide to the film. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish.

956723,A3TO3AY1UFM83U,B000CCW2O8,"not a natural ""Bob Bickel""","[1, 1]","Coming of age novels need not be limited to teenagers.  That seems an obvious enough statement, but it never occurred to me until I watched Separate Lies.  Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson are an affluent married couple, well into middle age, and long past the day-to-day thrill of new lives together.  If they're lucky, the excitement of being newly weds just starting out has given way to comfort, contentment, and mutual appreciation.  Sadly, they're not lucky.Wilkinson is a  hard-driving upper middle class professional who takes little pleasure in his work, however important it may be.  Still he dutifully and effectively proceeds to earn a lot of money and substantial status in a reliably steady way.His wife may seem to have less to occupy her, but meeting the expectations held for people of her station in life requires a investment of a good deal of top-drawer social capital and sustained commitment to providing a home commensurate with Wilkinson's attainments.  Though not immediately evident, her husband is often vaguely unhappy with her best efforts, offhandedly but hurtfully disdainful of her taste in many ways that betray his judgment that she is not quite well-suited to the socially prominent life he has provided them.  Wilkinson's character is a bit of a self-important snob.His wife eventually responds by having an affair with an indolent cad whose primary virtue is that he does not judge her.  The circumstances that bring knowledge of the affair to the fore are unexpected, complex, and traumatic.  Both Wilkinson and Watson, especially the former, are forced to examine their values, and each is the better for it, though the process is painful.  Maturation is not something that ends with adolescence, at least not for the primary characters in Separate Lies.It remains the case, however, that the emotional growth and enrichment of character experienced by Wilkinson and Watson would have been much more difficult if they had not been people of substantial means, unconcerned with money, where they would live, how they would get by, whether or not they were in danger of being destitute and alone.  Nevertheless, coming of age well into one's middle years is a moving and instructive venture that leaves the viewer changed, with a new slant on what it means to be an adult.  Lesser actors might not have been able to pull it off, but Wilson and Watson are superb, as is Hermine Norris in a supporting role.",5,Coming of Age Well Into Middle Age,1342396800,"07 16, 2012",2012,2440,"['Coming', 'age', 'novels', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'limited', 'teenagers', 'obvious', 'enough', 'statement', 'never', 'occurred', 'watched', 'Separate', 'Lies', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'are', 'affluent', 'married', 'couple', 'well', 'middle', 'age', 'long', 'day-to-day', 'thrill', 'new', 'lives', 'together', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'excitement', 'being', 'newly', 'weds', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'given', 'way', 'comfort', 'contentment', 'mutual', 'appreciation', 'Sadly', ""'re"", 'not', 'lucky.Wilkinson', 'hard-driving', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'professional', 'who', 'little', 'pleasure', 'work', 'however', 'important', 'may', 'be', 'Still', 'dutifully', 'effectively', 'proceeds', 'earn', 'lot', 'money', 'substantial', 'status', 'reliably', 'steady', 'way.His', 'wife', 'may', 'seem', 'have', 'less', 'occupy', 'meeting', 'expectations', 'held', 'people', 'station', 'life', 'investment', 'good', 'deal', 'top-drawer', 'social', 'capital', 'sustained', 'commitment', 'providing', 'home', 'commensurate', 'Wilkinson', 'attainments', 'not', 'immediately', 'evident', 'husband', 'often', 'vaguely', 'unhappy', 'best', 'efforts', 'offhandedly', 'hurtfully', 'disdainful', 'taste', 'many', 'ways', 'betray', 'judgment', 'not', 'quite', 'well-suited', 'socially', 'prominent', 'life', 'provided', 'Wilkinson', 'character', 'bit', 'self-important', 'snob.His', 'wife', 'eventually', 'having', 'affair', 'indolent', 'cad', 'primary', 'virtue', 'not', 'judge', 'circumstances', 'bring', 'knowledge', 'affair', 'fore', 'are', 'unexpected', 'complex', 'traumatic', 'Wilkinson', 'Watson', 'especially', 'former', 'are', 'forced', 'examine', 'values', 'better', 'process', 'painful', 'Maturation', 'not', 'something', 'adolescence', 'least', 'not', 'primary', 'characters', 'Separate', 'Lies.It', 'case', 'however', 'emotional', 'growth', 'enrichment', 'character', 'experienced', 'Wilkinson', 'Watson', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'people', 'substantial', 'means', 'unconcerned', 'money', 'where', 'would', 'live', 'how', 'would', 'get', 'not', 'were', 'danger', 'being', 'destitute', 'alone', 'Nevertheless', 'coming', 'age', 'well', 'one', 'middle', 'years', 'moving', 'instructive', 'venture', 'viewer', 'changed', 'new', 'slant', 'what', 'be', 'adult', 'Lesser', 'actors', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'Wilson', 'Watson', 'are', 'superb', 'Hermine', 'Norris', 'supporting', 'role']",N/A

Husband, wife, and lover become enmeshed in an intrigue to keep the police and the victim's wife from learning the truth of what happened.

956729,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000CCW2O8,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[6, 6]","Opening with idyllic shots of the English countryside in a wealthy neighborhood ""Separate Lies"" follows the disintegration of what appears to be a perfect marriage on the surface between a London solicitor James Manning(Tom Wilkinson), his wife Anne (Emily Watson) and Bill Bule (Rupert Everett in a cool performance) a mysterious wealthy stranger just returned from New York. When a local is killed in a hit and run accident suspicions fall on Bill. Manning pursues the case and uncovers an unsavory aspect of us life when he opens the door to try and convince Bill to do the right thing.A well made combination of character study and thriller  Fellowes' film reminds me quite a bit of ""Betrayal"" with the emotional twists and turns the character must go through. All three main actors give terrific performances but Wilkinson's slow burn performance takes center stage.  There the resemblance ends as the plot thickens ends as Manning, Anne and Bill are drawn further and further into a whirlpool of deceit.  Anchored by a trio outstanding performances ""Separate Lies"" does what English dramas do best and Hollywood rarely can do anymore-create a drama focused on the characters and their world.""Separate Lies"" features robust, bold colors that look marvelous in this transfer. The transfer has remarkable clarity and detail with no digital or analog artifacts that I can detect. Fox has pulled out all the stops in putting together the look and sound for this DVD. The 5.1 mix sounds quite good although it's not designed to use the format to best effect the surround speakers are used for subtle sound effects.Unfortunately we don't get much in the way of extras here just the original theatrical trailer and a commentary track however the commentary track by writer/director Fellowes is quite detailed with incredible insight and wit. This is one of the best commentary tracks I've heard so that makes up for the lack of other extras. Deleted scenes and outtakes would have been a nice edition to the film particularly with a trio of such terrific actors driving the drama in this film.Although this dramatic thriller won't be to everyone's taste, ""Separate Lies"" manages to be an involving, powerful drama with a trio of terrific performances. Those interested in a thought provoking morally complex drama will enjoy this film. Keep in mind this is much more in keeping with some of Hitchcock's more thoughtful, quiet thrillers than the over-the-top or larger than life thrillers that tend to dominate the theaters today.",4,Complex drama with strong performances 3 1/2 stars,1141516800,"03 5, 2006",2006,2527,"['Opening', 'idyllic', 'shots', 'English', 'countryside', 'wealthy', 'neighborhood', 'Separate', 'Lies', 'disintegration', 'what', 'be', 'perfect', 'marriage', 'surface', 'London', 'solicitor', 'James', 'Manning', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'wife', 'Anne', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Bill', 'Bule', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'cool', 'performance', 'mysterious', 'wealthy', 'stranger', 'just', 'returned', 'New', 'York', 'When', 'local', 'killed', 'hit', 'run', 'accident', 'suspicions', 'fall', 'Bill', 'Manning', 'case', 'uncovers', 'unsavory', 'aspect', 'life', 'when', 'door', 'try', 'convince', 'Bill', 'do', 'right', 'thing.A', 'well', 'made', 'combination', 'character', 'study', 'thriller', 'Fellowes', 'film', 'reminds', 'quite', 'bit', 'Betrayal', 'emotional', 'twists', 'character', 'must', 'go', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'give', 'terrific', 'performances', 'Wilkinson', 'slow', 'burn', 'performance', 'center', 'stage', 'resemblance', 'plot', 'Manning', 'Anne', 'Bill', 'are', 'drawn', 'further', 'further', 'whirlpool', 'deceit', 'Anchored', 'trio', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Separate', 'Lies', 'what', 'English', 'dramas', 'do', 'best', 'Hollywood', 'rarely', 'can', 'do', 'anymore-create', 'drama', 'focused', 'characters', 'world', 'Separate', 'Lies', 'robust', 'bold', 'colors', 'look', 'marvelous', 'transfer', 'transfer', 'remarkable', 'clarity', 'detail', 'digital', 'analog', 'artifacts', 'can', 'detect', 'Fox', 'pulled', 'out', 'stops', 'putting', 'together', 'look', 'sound', 'DVD', '5.1', 'mix', 'sounds', 'quite', 'good', 'not', 'designed', 'use', 'format', 'best', 'effect', 'surround', 'speakers', 'are', 'used', 'subtle', 'sound', 'effects.Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'way', 'extras', 'here', 'just', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'commentary', 'track', 'however', 'commentary', 'track', 'writer/director', 'Fellowes', 'quite', 'detailed', 'incredible', 'insight', 'wit', 'one', 'best', 'commentary', 'tracks', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'up', 'lack', 'other', 'extras', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'edition', 'film', 'particularly', 'trio', 'such', 'terrific', 'actors', 'driving', 'drama', 'film.Although', 'dramatic', 'thriller', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone', 'taste', 'Separate', 'Lies', 'be', 'involving', 'powerful', 'drama', 'trio', 'terrific', 'performances', 'interested', 'thought', 'provoking', 'morally', 'complex', 'drama', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Keep', 'mind', 'much', 'more', 'keeping', 'Hitchcock', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'quiet', 'thrillers', 'over-the-top', 'larger', 'life', 'thrillers', 'tend', 'dominate', 'theaters', 'today']",N/A
956730,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B000CCW2O8,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[9, 12]","I was so thrilled to that Emily Watson is starring in a dramatic film again, especially it's writen by the writer who penned Gosford Park which also starred Watson. I have been a loyal fan of her since her Oscar-nominated Breaking the Waves, and loved her other works include her second Oscar-nominated Hilary and Jackie and Angela's Ashes. After viewing this film, she has impressed me beyond her previous performances and I hope this film put her on the Oscar nomination list along with her equally brilliant and compelling costar Tom Wilkinson!This is an excellent film about a couple dealing with failing marriage, infidelity, accidental hit-and-ran crime, lies, and reconcilation. It's a very well writen suspense drama with plenty of heavy emotional and tender moments and a few sudden funny moments. The plot of the film surrounds four characters primarily and most of the scenes are meticulously rendered with top-notched acting and dialogues. It's certainly the most enjoyable film about infidelity and failing marriage I have seen since Unfaithful.On the surface, James(Wilkinson) and Anne Manning(Watson) looked like the perfect married couple except they don't have any children but an adorable little dog. He's a successful and powerful business man, and she's a devoted and loving housewife who is submissive at all time to him. Well, beneathe all that, she's discontended emotionally and sexually. She's unhappy to constantly have to please her husband and it's never been about what she needs or wants. When a handsome newly divorced carefree and wealthy neighbor Bill/William Bule(Rupert Everette) enter the picture, it became the perfect opportunity for Anne to find happiness and pleasure secretly.Things start to unravel when Anne and Bill were involved in a hit-and-ran accident that claimed the life of her housekeeper Maggie's(Linda Bassett) husband. At this point, Anne had to bring herself to a full confession to the unsuspecting James. This is where the two leads delivered the most intense and gripping moment of the film. It suddenly got very funny when Anne told James,"" Yes, I f*** Bill. No, I mean, Bill f*** me."" Then he rushed to open the kitchen door and simultaneously vomitted as a result of the shock. He would never imagined his wife could treat him that way and be so secretive about it. And yet, he never brought himself to release his anger by getting physical at her, he reluctantly had an affair with his secretary.James, Anne, and Bill would eventually have to deal with Maggie who told the police that Bill was responsible for the crime without knowing that Anne was the driver in the car that day. Since Maggie was so grateful that Anne had hired her years ago despite her past criminal record, she was willing to forgive her for the accident. Now, everything seemed to have fallen into pieces, and how will James save his marriage and become a good husband to his remorseful and volatile wife.The supporting performance from Linda Bassett was very good. I was not that impressed with the underexposed Rupert Everett whom I thought should have done a few cheating scenes with Watson. His lazy and careless character is not that sympathetic even when he got very ill. I am not convinced that could be the reason that Anne gave herself into his arms in the first place. Tom Wilkinson once again proves that he can take on all kinds of roles, good and evil, In The Bedroom, Girl With a Pearl Earring, Batman Begins, and The Exorcism of Emily Rose to name the examples. His role in this film is highly likeable, because he was willing to forgive and change to make things work at the most chaotic circumstances. The moment when he waited for Anne on a rainny night outside of Bill's apartment and told her that he wanted to be a better man and her to think of him was so touching to me. This might just be the perfect date movie for the grownups, and it's a must-see for the best performances of the year!",5,I am so taken by Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson's performances!,1128556800,"10 6, 2005",2005,3948,"['was', 'so', 'thrilled', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'starring', 'dramatic', 'film', 'again', 'especially', 'writen', 'writer', 'who', 'penned', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'also', 'starred', 'Watson', 'have', 'been', 'loyal', 'fan', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'loved', 'other', 'works', 'include', 'second', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Hilary', 'Jackie', 'Angela', 'Ashes', 'viewing', 'film', 'impressed', 'previous', 'performances', 'hope', 'film', 'put', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'list', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'compelling', 'costar', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'excellent', 'film', 'couple', 'dealing', 'failing', 'marriage', 'infidelity', 'accidental', 'hit-and-ran', 'crime', 'reconcilation', 'very', 'well', 'writen', 'suspense', 'drama', 'plenty', 'heavy', 'emotional', 'tender', 'moments', 'few', 'sudden', 'funny', 'moments', 'plot', 'film', 'four', 'characters', 'primarily', 'most', 'scenes', 'are', 'meticulously', 'rendered', 'top-notched', 'acting', 'dialogues', 'certainly', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'infidelity', 'failing', 'marriage', 'have', 'seen', 'Unfaithful.On', 'surface', 'James', 'Wilkinson', 'Anne', 'Manning', 'Watson', 'looked', 'perfect', 'married', 'couple', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'children', 'adorable', 'little', 'dog', 'successful', 'powerful', 'business', 'man', 'devoted', 'loving', 'housewife', 'who', 'submissive', 'time', 'Well', 'beneathe', 'discontended', 'emotionally', 'sexually', 'unhappy', 'constantly', 'have', 'please', 'husband', 'never', 'been', 'what', 'When', 'handsome', 'newly', 'divorced', 'carefree', 'wealthy', 'neighbor', 'Bill/William', 'Bule', 'Rupert', 'Everette', 'enter', 'picture', 'became', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'Anne', 'find', 'happiness', 'pleasure', 'secretly.Things', 'start', 'unravel', 'when', 'Anne', 'Bill', 'were', 'involved', 'hit-and-ran', 'accident', 'claimed', 'life', 'housekeeper', 'Maggie', 'Linda', 'Bassett', 'husband', 'point', 'Anne', 'had', 'bring', 'full', 'confession', 'unsuspecting', 'James', 'where', 'two', 'leads', 'delivered', 'most', 'intense', 'gripping', 'moment', 'film', 'suddenly', 'got', 'very', 'funny', 'when', 'Anne', 'told', 'James', 'Yes', 'f***', 'Bill', 'No', 'mean', 'Bill', 'Then', 'rushed', 'open', 'kitchen', 'door', 'simultaneously', 'vomitted', 'result', 'shock', 'would', 'never', 'imagined', 'wife', 'could', 'treat', 'way', 'be', 'so', 'secretive', 'yet', 'never', 'brought', 'release', 'anger', 'getting', 'physical', 'reluctantly', 'had', 'affair', 'secretary.James', 'Anne', 'Bill', 'would', 'eventually', 'have', 'deal', 'Maggie', 'who', 'told', 'police', 'Bill', 'was', 'responsible', 'crime', 'knowing', 'Anne', 'was', 'driver', 'car', 'day', 'Maggie', 'was', 'so', 'grateful', 'Anne', 'had', 'hired', 'years', 'ago', 'past', 'criminal', 'record', 'was', 'willing', 'forgive', 'accident', 'Now', 'everything', 'seemed', 'have', 'fallen', 'pieces', 'how', 'will', 'James', 'save', 'marriage', 'become', 'good', 'husband', 'remorseful', 'volatile', 'wife.The', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Linda', 'Bassett', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'underexposed', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'whom', 'thought', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'few', 'cheating', 'scenes', 'Watson', 'lazy', 'careless', 'character', 'not', 'sympathetic', 'even', 'when', 'got', 'very', 'ill', 'am', 'not', 'convinced', 'could', 'be', 'reason', 'Anne', 'gave', 'arms', 'first', 'place', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'once', 'again', 'can', 'take', 'kinds', 'roles', 'good', 'evil', 'Bedroom', 'Girl', 'Pearl', 'Earring', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'name', 'examples', 'role', 'film', 'highly', 'likeable', 'was', 'willing', 'forgive', 'change', 'make', 'things', 'work', 'most', 'chaotic', 'circumstances', 'moment', 'when', 'waited', 'Anne', 'rainny', 'night', 'Bill', 'apartment', 'told', 'wanted', 'be', 'better', 'man', 'think', 'was', 'so', 'touching', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'perfect', 'date', 'movie', 'grownups', 'must-see', 'best', 'performances', 'year']",N/A
956731,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000CCW2O8,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[0, 1]","An original story and extremely inspired acting creates an enjoyable movie experience, but the slow pace and lack of sympathy for the characters detracts.Tom Wilkinson is great as James Manning, a London businessman who discovers that his wife (Emily Watson) has been cheating on him with a younger apathetic businessman (Rupert Everert). When a mysterious hit and run accident kills the Manning's maid's husband, James is forced to make the decision to lie to protect his unfaithful wife, or to reveal the truth.Separate Lies is a well-crafted statement on the idea of honesty, decency, and deception, and when one is perhaps more appropriate than the other. Maybe lies protect us for a while, but perhaps painful experiences lead us to acceptance and reality. Although, by the end of the film, it's a bit confusing as to which way the writer-director seems to be leaning on the subject.Tom Wilkinson and Rupert Everett deliver superb performances, but Emily Watson's seems to stumble around a bit. It may just be that her character is flaky, but a few of her acting choices are a little shaky.
