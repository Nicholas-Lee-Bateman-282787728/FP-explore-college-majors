""brnn64""","[9, 9]","If you get this title-you've seen the DVD and KNOW what I'm talking about!Aaron McGruder's THE BOONDOX has provoked a lot of thought and controversy in the newspaper cartoons-and the animated version is (amazingly) even better!Huey and Riley & co. tackle some really important issues in Black America with raw, biting social commentary and humor. As was the case with Richard Pryor, I didn't like the repetitive use of the N-word and soem scenes get really graphic (such as the portrayal of the urination scene of the infamous R. Kelly video).But I wouldn't throw out the baby with the bath on this one. In THE TRIAL OF R.KELLY, Huey and Riley take on the manner in which some Black celebrites (and their lawyers) brainwash the masses into thinking their crimes are really racist persecution rather than their own personal stupidity. Having seen this sickening scenario with Mike Tyson and Marion Barry in the 90s, I wanted to stand up and cheer when Huey told the court R. KELLY AIN'T NO NELSON MANDELA-LET'S HAVE SOME G-----N STANDARDS!"" Three cheers and a pumped fist from me Aaron!The same is true when MLK comes back from a coma and curses out some fools acting like a BET video come to life. ""DID I GET KILLED FOR THIS!?"" Bill Cosby would love it (I know I do)!Black self-hatred is viciously lampooned with the Uncle Ruckus character, who longs for the return of slavery and worships Ronald Reagan and all things white. When the cops shoot him in one episode, he says, ""I can't blame y'all for doing your job.""Ed Asner plays a corrupt (and racist) businessman who cheats little Jazmine out of her lemonade business (among other things). Any Black person who has had to endure patronizing conversation from White liberals will identify with THE GARDEN PARTY.I would advise skipping the commentary. The creators laugh so much and tell so manyinside jokes that we get very little insight at all. But that can easily be skipped. The DELETED SCENES (especially the Rosa Parks-fried chicken gag) would give Al Sharpton a fit and I can see why that was never aired.The humor and satire is rough and raw. It takes a lot of familiarity with African-American culture and pop culture in general to ""get"" a lot of this (such as the biz about a Black Panther named ""Shabazz K. Milton Berle"" that I mention in my title). I would not let the kiddies near this one.

While I'm not overly fond of cursing and use of ""the n-word"", I must admit each episode is fabulous despite the language.  There is an actual moral to each episode, which can be used as a teaching tool for pre-teen children.  Of particular note is the episode ""A Date With The Health Inspector"" in which they have the single most awesome explanation of the steps leading to the war with Iraq that I've ever witnessed.  Many would watch this episode and never catch it, so here's a clue: the character ""Ed Wuncler, III"" is a young George W. Bush (voiced by Charlie Murphy) and his ""enforcer"" friend, ""Gin Rummy"" (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) represents Dick Cheney.  In the midst of an investigation of a real crime, they take a detour with the obvious intention of robbing a store (the owner's name is Aladin Husein).  They accuse Husein of having a weapon ostensibly to justify what they are about to do.  No matter how much Husein says he has no weapons, George ... er, ahem, I mean Ed, III and Rummy insist he does; so much so that even the security guard - who CLEARLY sees Husein has nothing - becomes convinced Husein must have a weapon!  Funniest to me was Husein uttering, ""Ed, you know me, your father helped me build this store!  There are no weapons here.  Perhaps you mean the Korean store north of here.""  If that ain't a blatant slap of truth, I don't know what is! lol.  At the conclusion of this ""war"" Ed and Rummy are met by camera crews and America-loving spectators who know that they've just committed a crime, but since Husein is ""of terrorist decent"" they celebrate them.  The purchase price is well worth it just for this episode alone, but there are 14 others on this 3 disc set, that you will watch over and over again.NOTE: please do NOT allow young children to watch this alone.

985452,A1X15AQVSCKKRG,B000F8O2QK,GreatMovieCriticForever,"[0, 0]","""The Boondocks"" cartoon series is based on the comic strip created by Aaron McGrude in 1999. Although many people have a different opinion as to what it is about, it's life seen through the eyes of African Americans and takes a look at their culture, racism, politics and everyday life.After watching the series I knew it was in for a treat. I went back and looked at the comic strips and also enjoyed it. The comics started around 1997 then many years later here we have the cartoon series about the Freemans: Huey, Riley and Grandpa.This series again is very much in your face, at times satirical, philosophical and always entertaining. It seems at times that Aaron does like exploit the use of ""N"" word in the series. However, ignoring this series is guaranteed to make you laugh.The character of Uncle Ruckus (also on the strip) is a racist black man who hates his own race and praises white people. Tom Dubois is a successful black man (who is combo of an Uncle Tom mixed with W.E.B Dubois) often serving as the voice of reason yet at times being very conservative and conforming to the white man's world if you will.My favorite episode of the bad are ""The Trial of R. Kelly"" , ""The Return of King"" (a what if episode looking at what would occur if Martin Luther King Jr. would still be alive), ""Guess Hoe's Coming to Dinner"", and ""A Date with the health inspector"" (a great look at racial profiling) and ""Passion of the Ruckus"".The DVD sets for the first season come loaded with special features which include: Audio and Video commentary for the first ten episodes, a making of feature, unaired promos for CN, an animatics looks at the series and deleted scenes.The commentaries are decent. Sometimes the crew does get caught in watching the episode instead of commenting on them but they do provide enough information to give you an insight as to what it was like in making the series. For instance, Aaron mentions that the original opening was going to be a Star Wars like opening but for whatever reason it never happened.All in all, a great set to own if you haven't seen the episodes then this is a must have.",5,The Boondocks the complete series,1182470400,"06 22, 2007",2007,2120,"['Boondocks', 'cartoon', 'series', 'based', 'comic', 'strip', 'created', 'Aaron', 'McGrude', '1999', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'different', 'opinion', 'what', 'life', 'seen', 'eyes', 'African', 'Americans', 'look', 'culture', 'racism', 'politics', 'everyday', 'life.After', 'watching', 'series', 'knew', 'was', 'treat', 'went', 'back', 'looked', 'comic', 'strips', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'comics', 'started', '1997', 'then', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'here', 'have', 'cartoon', 'series', 'Freemans', 'Huey', 'Riley', 'Grandpa.This', 'series', 'again', 'very', 'much', 'face', 'times', 'satirical', 'philosophical', 'always', 'entertaining', 'times', 'Aaron', 'exploit', 'use', 'N', 'word', 'series', 'However', 'ignoring', 'series', 'guaranteed', 'make', 'laugh.The', 'character', 'Uncle', 'Ruckus', 'also', 'strip', 'racist', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'own', 'race', 'white', 'people', 'Tom', 'Dubois', 'successful', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'combo', 'Uncle', 'Tom', 'mixed', 'W.E.B', 'Dubois', 'often', 'serving', 'voice', 'reason', 'yet', 'times', 'being', 'very', 'conservative', 'conforming', 'white', 'man', 'world', 'will.My', 'favorite', 'episode', 'bad', 'are', 'Trial', 'R.', 'Kelly', 'Return', 'King', 'what', 'episode', 'looking', 'what', 'would', 'occur', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Jr.', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'alive', 'Guess', 'Hoe', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'Date', 'health', 'inspector', 'great', 'look', 'racial', 'profiling', 'Passion', 'Ruckus', '.The', 'DVD', 'first', 'season', 'come', 'loaded', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'Audio', 'Video', 'commentary', 'first', 'ten', 'episodes', 'making', 'feature', 'unaired', 'promos', 'CN', 'animatics', 'series', 'deleted', 'scenes.The', 'commentaries', 'are', 'decent', 'Sometimes', 'crew', 'get', 'caught', 'watching', 'episode', 'instead', 'commenting', 'do', 'provide', 'enough', 'information', 'give', 'insight', 'what', 'was', 'making', 'series', 'instance', 'Aaron', 'mentions', 'original', 'opening', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Star', 'Wars', 'opening', 'reason', 'never', 'great', 'set', 'own', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'episodes', 'then', 'must', 'have']",N/A

985456,AQ38OU6SRFGU5,B000F8O2QK,"Jeffery E. Blascyk ""the Shamrock kid""","[3, 3]","The Boondocks is an animated cartoon that is based on the comic strip of the same name, created by Aaron McGruder.  The series is featured on cables Adult Swim late at night, but not sure exactly when, (I don't watch much TV, that's why I got the DVD) and is geared for more mature audiences.  I feel you really have to be older to get into this show; the subject matter and the way it's dealt with are very witty and sophisticated.  I watched one episode with my 13 year old son and he didn't understand about a lot of the jokes, he did laugh when young Huey was screaming, ""Ronald Reagan was the devil"".  That's funny no matter how old you are, but didn't know why many black people (and whites) would have that perspective; I guess they skip over those issues in school.If you're familiar with the comic strip, it's kinda has the same spirit, even though the strip seems more political than the series.  The Boondocks is social comedy that features race as a subject matter and more tackles the subject by looking at the cultures of the race and not just white vs. black..  Huey (the main character) and his little brother Riley are young black kids from the hood being raised in a rich suburban neighborhood by their once civil right activist grandfather.Huey is well spoken, left leaning and highly educated about culture and politically charged topics.  He's a bit of Spike Lee, Mos Def and Malcolm X all in one.  I think this character is the closest to who the writer/creator McGruder is in the real world and shares many of the same points of view as young Huey does.  McGruder has a degree in African American studies and seems to voice as much criticism about his own race through the show, as he does on white people.  Huey's little thug bother Riley is your typical hood rat gangster wanna be that also has intelligence but rarely uses it.  Instead he looks at the world a bit differently than his older brother and chooses to embrace the gun toting, rolling on rims, booty shaken rap video, thug culture that is glamorized and sensationalized in the media far too offend  and revered by many youth of today.McGruder does an amazing job of showing the good, the bad, the ugly and the goofy things about being black in America.  He uses a diverse cast of characters to achieve all the different perspectives.  The rich, white old guy that not racist per say, but will exploit black people or anyone else to make a buck.  The rich mans son, that thinks he's black and wanna be thug (voiced by Charlie Murphy from the Chapel Show) and his best friend Gin Rummy (who also thinks he's gangsta, voiced by Samuel L. Jackson)  The educated, soft spoken, clean cut black lawyer with his white wife and mixed race daughter.  Granddad who gives the older black man perspective and his friend who is the darkest skinned black man in the show, who hates blacks and thinks the white man has helped the black man is every way possible, hates MLK and is pro slavery.This show is just not about Black culture, this show has so many jokes about people in general you see everyday that are so funny and so true.  It was funny to me to watch episode 1 (the garden party) where it features a black man saying the N-word about 60 times to a bunch of tight lipped, stuffed shirt, rich white people and them not knowing if they should laugh or be offended, while I watched this with white people who didn't know if they should laugh or be offended.  It's pure gold.  The animation style has Japanese influence with an urban feel that makes the show stand out from other ""cartoons"".  The fight scenes between the various characters in the show are well done and great fun to watch.  This show also features some of the best voice actors that bring every character alive.  This show has tons of high profile guest voices that do lots of episodes.This show takes a unique look at world today and what makes black and white culture so unique.  McGruder tackles black on black crime, rap wars, MLK, R. Kelly peeing on underage girls.  How blacks and whites deal with similar issues in a very different way.  Where is black Jesus?  How terrible BET is, and how it kills brain sells.  It attempts to raise social awareness of black culture and shows white America that black people have divorce opinions on what direction to move toward as a race.  This show, to me is about finding a middle ground of being proud of your race and culture without embracing every negative stereotype that exists.  People also have to come to an understanding what perpetuates those stereotypes in culture.  Just because you don't embrace it, many people do, that's why the stereotype exists.  There are thug black guys, there are white people that are scared of blacks, there is too much black on black crime and there is far too much patronizing guilt by white people as they offer no real solutions to better the social climate.Yes, white people move to the burbs to get away from black people and yes black people need more strong black leaders instead of just embracing athletes and entertainers you see on TV all the time.  Some of the issues can be hard to swallow but with the amount of humor used to convey these points, and many others, make it much easier to deal with.  Hopefully after your done laughing some of these subjects will stay with you long enough for you to have some real thoughts or maybe even dialog about these issues, with family or friends or god forbid, someone from another ethnic background....AAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!One thing that Black people have on us white people is that they can talk about race and cultural differences much easier than white people can.  I mean, whites don't even talk about race relations with one another unless they know that the person they are talking to feels the same.  Why?  Well, white people are scared of having an opinion about other cultures.  Most white people are scared of sounding racist or having an opinion that could be conceived as so.  I think the world would be better off if the wrong things were said once in a while, so some real dialog could happen about some real social change that needs to happen in this country.Yes there are many cultures and ethnic groups in the county but blacks and whites are like the Yankees and the Red Sox, we have so much history and so much we've done to point the finger at the other and done to keep each other down.  It's much better than what it was 50 years ago, but until we all get the elephant out of the room whites and blacks will always feel taken for granted by the other race. TV Shows like this one, South Park and the Chapple show do such a service to take tension always from this issue long enough and let all people look at there own people and laugh.  Not just laughing about their people, but with their people.The show is proof, to the close minded conservative white man, that not only are black people socially aware of the plight and short comings in there community, there are many intelligent, free thinking men and women in that community that are willing to voice their opinions, and work to combat the problems in the black community.  There needs to be more of this of course, but it's a start.  It's a shame that the white race isn't quite there yet.",5,"You'll bust your gut laughing, if your not too scared you'll offend someone by doing so.",1198713600,"12 27, 2007",2007,7259,"['Boondocks',

Characters like Grampa and Riley are fun to watch because that's what I really look for in an (adult) animated comedy series. Guest voices like Samuel L. Jackson and Adam West are also great addition to this production. This show is American, but drawn in an anime style that is sharp and captivating.Adult Swim had introduce me to these two young boys because I'd never read the comics book and I read that those who had read the comics had stated the show is more vulgar than the strip. During the opening credits I was amazed to see Regina Kings name for the leading roles and that alone had me anxious to see it. The use of King voice actually works well with them. No such reservations about Witherspoon though, he fits Granddad like a glove and does really well with the character. Everyone seemed to do well in the first episode's supporting cast but really these main three are the ones that matter the most. My personal favorites (for now) are `The Itis,' `A Huey Freeman Christmas,' `The trail of R. Kelly,' `Wingman,' and `The Health Inspector.' The styles of humor and drama do change, sometimes radically, from episode to episode, so it may very well be possible for someone to love certain episodes and be unimpressed with another. Many folks are upset with the usage of the N* word and quite a few other references but Aaron McGruder is writing what he knows - and what many other African Americans know.`The Boondocks' is a successful and entertaining comedy that has obviously embedded a specific style and presentation. Huey and Riley are two cute little kids that are opinionated, intelligent...and growing up with a foot in two worlds-which looks to stay that way. This show isn't for everyone and it's only meant for entertainment purposes. Looking forward for season two.",4,O!

The Boondocks is everything it looks to be and more. It goes with its comedy and Aaron Mcgruder goes even further with his take on today's government and today's society. If you don't already know the comic strip the Boondocks is about a nice grandfather (John Witherspoon) stepping up to take care of his grandkids so he moves them from the city to the suburbs. As soon as you start watching the series you'll notice he's not really a nice grandfather. He's got a short temper, a dirty mouth, and hates it when somebody drinks all his orange juice.Now Huey and Riley are two very interesting kids, Riley is a big follower but a leader at the same time. He chooses to go the opposite way in life than Huey but at the same time he follows the stereotypes while Huey is trying to destroy that cycle. The amazing characters definitely make this series what it is especially Ruckus who is given a name that fits his demeanor. I have never met a person so racist towards their own people the way Ruckus is and though that might sound crazy to some he is actually hilarious. He really reminds you of Clayton Bigsby from Chappelle's show.Thank goodness Adult Swim picked up this series because anywhere else it would have been canceled by now. Aaron uses an outstanding set of characters to put across messages and he assigns that power to Huey Freeman. Sometimes no matter how serious Huey tries to be you can't help but laugh at the things he does. He's a strong little man with a much different style than most 10 year olds you know. If you think the scene from the preview at the Garden Party when Huey gets on stage and makes an unforgettable announcement was funny wait till you see what else he's got for you.A great thing about this series is that it stays true to the comic strip and Mcgruder is allowed to go crazier than he does in the strip.  If you ask me this show is exactly what we need, not only to give a few laughs but also to show what is being ignored. I think Mcgruder is absolutely right about R Kelly and somebody needed to say it again. Mcgruder's sketch on Martin Luther King and how he feels about what's going on with the youth is interesting and is probably accurate. Guest appearances kill and give the series that extra something especially Mike Epps when he plays Granddads old buddy that he absolutely hates. The series is unique and hilarious and no lie the more you see it the more you love it and I can't wait for season 2.",5,Can't Deny A Perfect Series,1158364800,"09 16, 2006",2006,2549,"['Yes', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'have', 'waited', 'DVD', 'think', 'everyone', 'should', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'happy', 'Boondocks', 'everything', 'be', 'more', 'comedy', 'Aaron', 'Mcgruder', 'even', 'further', 'take', 'today', 'government', 'today', 'society', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'comic', 'strip', 'Boondocks', 'nice', 'grandfather', 'John', 'Witherspoon', 'stepping', 'up', 'take', 'care', 'grandkids', 'so', 'city', 'suburbs', 'As', 'soon', 'start', 'watching', 'series', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'not', 'really', 'nice', 'grandfather', 'got', 'short', 'temper', 'dirty', 'mouth', 'when', 'somebody', 'orange', 'juice.Now', 'Huey', 'Riley', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'interesting', 'kids', 'Riley', 'big', 'follower', 'leader', 'same', 'time', 'go', 'opposite', 'way', 'life', 'Huey', 'same', 'time', 'stereotypes', 'Huey', 'trying', 'destroy', 'cycle', 'amazing', 'characters', 'definitely', 'make', 'series', 'what', 'especially', 'Ruckus', 'who', 'given', 'name', 'demeanor', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'person', 'so', 'racist', 'towards', 'own', 'people', 'way', 'Ruckus', 'might', 'sound', 'crazy', 'actually', 'hilarious', 'really', 'Clayton', 'Bigsby', 'Chappelle', 'show.Thank', 'goodness', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'picked', 'up', 'series', 'anywhere', 'else', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'canceled', 'now', 'Aaron', 'outstanding', 'set', 'characters', 'put', 'messages', 'power', 'Huey', 'Freeman', 'Sometimes', 'matter', 'how', 'serious', 'Huey', 'tries', 'be', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'things', 'strong', 'little', 'man', 'much', 'different', 'style', 'most', '10', 'year', 'olds', 'know', 'think', 'scene', 'preview', 'Garden', 'Party', 'when', 'Huey', 'stage', 'unforgettable', 'announcement', 'was', 'funny', 'wait', 'till', 'see', 'what', 'else', 'got', 'you.A', 'great', 'thing', 'series', 'true', 'comic', 'strip', 'Mcgruder', 'allowed', 'go', 'crazier', 'strip', 'ask', 'show', 'exactly', 'what', 'need', 'not', 'only', 'give', 'few', 'laughs', 'also', 'show', 'what', 'being', 'ignored', 'think', 'Mcgruder', 'absolutely', 'right', 'R', 'Kelly', 'somebody', 'needed', 'say', 'again', 'Mcgruder', 'sketch', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'how', 'what', 'going', 'youth', 'interesting', 'probably', 'accurate', 'Guest', 'appearances', 'kill', 'give', 'series', 'extra', 'something', 'especially', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'when', 'Granddads', 'old', 'buddy', 'absolutely', 'series', 'unique', 'hilarious', 'lie', 'more', 'see', 'more', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', '2']",N/A

Regina King provides the voices for both Huey and Riley Freeman; two young brothers living with their Grandfather in suburbia.  Throughout these 15 episodes, McGruder and co. take aim at social and racial issues; and for a majority of the time, they hit the nail on the head.  The first episode, entitled ""Garden Party"", introduces us to everyone, including the maniacal Uncle Ruckus who will have you on the floor laughing.  R. Kelly isn't spared in ""The Trial of R. Kelly"", and the surprisingly poignant ""Return of the King"" (which received much criticism from Al Sharpton) remains the high point of the series so far.  Charlie Murphy and even Samuel L. Jackson have recurring roles as two white gangsta wanna-be's who provide some even funnier moments than Uncle Ruckus, but it's the show's politically charged riffs that seperate the Boondocks from the rest of the Adult Swim lineup.

985483,A15MLF38WROSWU,B000F8O2QK,"S. M. Anderson ""sma331""","[9, 11]","I was so excited when I found out this show was being released on DVD.  I did not have comedy central at the time, and was not able to watch the show.  I was hearing about it, and wished I could see it.  When this show was released on DVD I rushed out and bought my set, and it was money well spent.  Aaron McGruder has gotten under a lot of peoples skin with his hard hitting comic strip.  Well brining it to life in animation and judging by some of the reviews I read he angered even more people.If you are not an open minded person this show will NOT be for you.  If you can't understand why the N word is used (and trust me I'm one of those people that despises the word, but understood exactly what McGruder was doing), then this show will NOT be for you.The show has many funny moments, but also moments that are very thought provoking.  McGruder tackles topics that many people want to ignore, or see as no big deal.  Music videos, and R Kelly to name a couple of the topics he hits on.  I was hooked when the first episode started at the Garden Party.""Excuse me, Everyone, I have a brief announcement to make.  Jesus was black, Ronald Reagan was the devil, and the Government is lying about 9/11.  Thank you for your time, and good night.""  Turns out Heuy is dreaming about a riot after his annoucment, but you can't help but laugh.John Witherspoon is the voice of the Grandfather, and Regina King lends her vocal talents to both Heuy and Riley.  Other notable voices are Sam Jackson, Charlie Murphy, Adam West, Ed Asner,Huey is 10 years old and not happy about living in a white suburb, and tries his best to share his knowledge, and will scream it if he has to.  Huey is political, and in his past life was probably a Black Panther!!!  He is irritated when people comment how articulate he sounds (how should he sound?).  He can't understand why folks worship R Kelly like he is a hero when it is clear that he has done something horribly wrong.Riley is the total opposite of his brother.  He is immersed in hip hop culture, and can't understand why Huey is always trying to knock his hustle.Uncle Ruckus, what can you say about him?  He is the type of person that makes you shake your head with all his self hatred, and denial of being black.  While funny, it does make you think, because there are people out there like this.  ""I have a disease that darkens my skin!!!""  Uncle Rukus thinks being black is an ailment.The scene doing Tae Bo naked had me covering my eyes, and laughing at the same time.  So cheap he won't buy the Tae Bo series, just works out to the commercial. Ed Wuncler the III can't decide who he is, but he is so hardcore.  When Riley shoots Wuncler the III out of a window, you sit there shocked at first, then you collapse in laughter.""What's wrong with Golden Showers for a gift?  Sounds nice.  I like Gold and I like Shouwers.""  Poor Grandpa, so out of touch with certain sayings.  ""If I did not want to get peed on, I would have moved out of the way!!!!""  Ha!!!Dubois is a Blackman married to a white woman, with an interracial child who sees the world through rose colored glasses.  In one episode Dubois fears going to prison so much, that he dreams about it.  He fears being raped, and his worst fear is almost realized when he is arrested for mistaken identity.My favorite episodes:Guess Ho's coming to dinnerGranddads FightThe story ofGangstaliciousThe RealReturn of the KingThe ItisThe RealLet's Nab OprahThe Block is hotHonestly I really enjoyed every single episode off of this set.  There is a message in everyone.Guess Ho's coming to dinnerKat Williams being cast as a Pimp Named Slickback was simply hilarious.  Perfect voice for it, and the fact the cartoon looked like him was also funny.  I just about lost it when Slickback says ""What woman Sir?  This heres a ho."", when grandpa wants to know why Slickback is coming after Chrystal.""She's in sales.  Ho-sale.""  Ha!!!!Colonel StinkmeanerA blindman who drives!!!  This episode was really funny.  You have two old men who want to fight, and it's pretty much touted as the geriatric thriller in manilla.The animation detail was fantastic.The Story of GangstaliciousRiley's hero Ganstalicious keeps getting shot.  He is performing his new song ""I got shot"", and he literally does get shot.  No one helps him thinking it's part of the act.  When Riley finds out what ""thugging love"" is really about, he gets sick.A Huey Freeman ChristmasIt's Christmas season at the Boondocks.  Santa is attacked in front of the kids.  Hueys is given the job to direct the Christmas pageant.  Huey makes sure the pageant has music by Quincy Jones and professional actors.  Riley is really upset with Santa and keeps chasing Santa screaming ""pay what you owe.""  I'm laughing just thinking about it.The RealRiley thinks it's a great idea for Grandpa to lie so the house can be on extreme makeover, and the car can be Pimped.  Everything is working out just fine until Grandpa forgets to play blind and is busted.  The house is left a mess, and they get the huge bill for pimping the car.Return of the KingThis has to be the most misunderstood and controversial episodes on the DVD set.  Martin wakes up from a 30 year coma and finds out streets are named after him.  Martin does not like what he is seeing.  There is a march being advertised by a radio station called 95.5 The Freak.  March turns into a rumpshaker, and Martin totally loses his temper.A lot of people felt the episode disrespected the late Martin Luther King.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion.  I felt the cartoon depicted what people should be saying.  Seems right now all people care about is partying, but not about the causes that are of great concern to the black community.The It is""The food taste like hot armpit on what toast.""  Yet another line that stood out.Robert creates a sandwich that causes people to become addicted.  It's called The Luther.  Big Beef Patty, 5 pieces of bacon, cheese between Krispy Cream doughnut.  Talk about a heart attack waiting to happen!!!  It caused people to commit crimes, and they would gain weight.  Most of all they wanted to do nothing but sleep.  Turns out Winsler was hoping to buy a park, and when the neighborhood went bad, he was able to do just that very thing.The Block is HotJasmine sells her lemonade and Mr. Winsler thinks she needs to think big.  In order to profit she has to sell way more lemonade to make her quota.  What used to be fun for her, is now turning into a chore, and she is no closer to getting her pony thanks to the thieving Winsler.  Winsler is exploiting her.  Her lemonade is so good, when she runs out, people start a Riot.  Mr. Ruckus is shot by the police.  He turns down a nice 7 figure settlement just to become a cop himself.  All because he felt they did not mean to shoot him.  Yeah, he is still in total denial about being black.  Crazy man, yes he is.I simply love this show.  It's funny, but it's also engaging, it touches on serious topics with a touch of humor.  For people who found this show offensive, maybe it's offensive because the truth is staring you dead in the face, and for once you have to acknowledge what is being said.  I especially liked the extras, and when McGruder made mention of why he uses the N-word, it totally clicked and I understood.  Still don't like the word, but he was right in what he said.  Some people are so immune to the word; they don't bother to even realize it's being said that often.Excellent show and it is worth owning, because you will want to watch it a lot.  I know I do.",5,Great Series a must have in your DVD collection,1166054400,"12 14, 2006",2006,7559,"['was', 'so', 'excited', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'show', 'was', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'did',

985491,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B000F8O2QK,Wheelchair Assassin,"[26, 34]","Huey Freeman is angry.  And can you blame him?  As a ten-year-old aspiring black revolutionary living in the almost entirely white suburb of Woodcrest with his stern, authoritarian grandfather and his thug-worshipping younger brother Riley after relocating from Chicago's tough South Side, Huey is faced with the grim realities of both white condescension and black ignorance as he tries to call to light the truths people would rather not face.  In the opening scene of The Boondocks, Aaron McGruder's confrontational, profane, and brilliantly satirical adaptation of his comic strip, Huey envisions himself inciting a riot at an all-white garden party by reporting some unpleasant truths (at least in his mind) about Jesus, Ronald Reagan, and 9/11, but when he actually gets a chance to do so he merely finds himself praised for being ""articulate.""  And when he tries to bring his vision of a black Jesus to the masses via his school Christmas play (with some help from Denzel Washington, Angela Bassett, and Quincy Jones), his work becomes the target of a boycott by parents angry at the exclusion of their children.  Not to mention, he has to watch a race-baiting white laywer exploit black-white divisions to get R. Kelly off on underage peeing charges, and witness two wanna-be master criminals exploiting wartime paranoia to rob a store when he just wants to get his friend out of jail.  All in all, Huey faces un uphill climb in his quest to shake a comfortable populace out of its complacency.Huey's attempts at fomenting revolution, however, are just the tip of the iceberg in The Boondocks, which presents viewers with a mix of the political, social, philosophical and sentimental that I have yet to see in animated TV.  It comes along at just the right time, too, as many cartoon giants have come to feel increasingly calcified: South Park, while still a frequently brilliant show, has become increasingly reliant on excessive toilet humor and often contrived topicality; The Simpsons ran out of ideas about eight years ago; and the ""revived"" Family Guy has become a lazy, unfunny mockery of its former self, weighed down by interminable, punch line-less ""jokes"" and rapid-fire successions of random, context-free pop culture references.  Viewed in this context, the Boondocks feels refreshingly raw, witty, and character-driven in its approach; and more importantly, it's frequently, gut-busting hilarious regardless of whether you're always in agreement with its subversive viewpoint or whether you approve of its near-constant use of the N-word among other choice terms.  There are some overtly topical episodes-taking incisive aim at such subjects at hip-hop culture (The Story of Gangstalicious); the legacy of the civil rights movement and the post-9/11 closing of the American Mind (The Return of the King); and traditional attitudes regarding Christmas (A Huey Freeman Christmas)-but they never diminish the episodes as vehicles for telling stories or exploring characters.  Some of the best episodes are actually more personal and familial than political-in Riley Wuz Here, Huey's ignorant younger brother explores his artistic side with the help of a kindly but insane gun-toting art-teacher, while Wingmen sees both Huey and Granddad confronting figures from their pasts in a return to their old neighborhood for the funeral of Granddad's friend.  And throughout, there's the show's examination of the generation gap and the dynamics of a decidedly atypical family, as we frequently see the size of the gulf between Huey, Riley, and their old-school, tough-loving grandfather.The voice acting is top-to-bottom terrific, starting with Regina King, who deserves special props for taking on double duty by performing the roles of both Huey and Riley (most impressively, I heard that she read all her Huey lines and all her Riley lines separately, no small task considering how different the voices are and how frequently she has to act against herself).  In the other principal role, John Witherspoon is suitably grizzled and cantankerous as Granddad, while Gary Anthony Williams (aka Stevie's father from Malcolm in the Middle) is hilariously over the top as Uncle Ruckus, an elderly Uncle Tom with a freakishly large right eye who in one episode actually turns his hatred of his own people into a religion.  An array of one-off and recurring guest stars including Adam West (R. Kelly's slimy lawyer), Ed Asner (rapacious capitalist Ed Wuncler), Charlie Murphy (inept criminal and George W. Bush mockup Ed Wuncler III) and Samuel L. Jackson (Ed III's partner in crime and Donald Rumsfeld caricature Gin Rummy) helps expand the show's stable of memorable characters even more, bringing it close to prime-era Simpsons in terms of creating a far-reaching and (somewhat) lifelike make-believe world.Where the Boondocks really outshines much of its competition, though, is its appearance.  Simply put, this show looks incredible: rich, colorful, and expressive it a way most animation scarcely approaches.  Owing a heavy debt to Japanese anime, especially in its occasional, but brilliantly shot, fight scenes, The Boondocks far surpasses the likes of Family Guy and South Park in its attention to detail, be it the astonishingly lifelike background scenery or the intimate (if not always pleasant) details of its characters' appearances.  Hell, Huey's afro and Uncle Ruckus's oversized eye alone are practically worth the price of the DVD set.Along with the 15 episodes on these discs, the season one DVD set is laden with the kind of time-wasting extras hardcore fans crave: several insightful commentaries (plus two not-so-insightful ones with Uncle Ruckus, which are just plain funny), animatics, three deleted scenes (all of them hilarious), and a 20-minute featurette, heavy on McGruder's commentary, regarding the process of bringing his vision to the screen.  In all, this season set is more than worth the price for those in the mood for a departure from the animated-TV norm.",5,Worth every penny,1158969600,"09 23, 2006",2006,6001,"['Huey', 'Freeman',
