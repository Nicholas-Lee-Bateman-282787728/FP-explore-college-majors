1641779,AC2BVORKJ99QX,B00C4UR3PO,JLYB,"[0, 0]","For decades Star Trek originals, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager have been my favorite series....until I watched Merlin on Netflix.  I will be buying it very soon, I can't wait.  The stories are wonderful and well-conceived and written.  Gorgeous scenery and music, wonderful acting, the characters grow and change, and the friendship that builds between Merlin and Arthur is funny and heart-warming.  And who wouldn't enjoy watching lovely women, and men in chain maille and capes, riding beautiful horses through really wonderful places.  Then there are the interesting magical creatures, and especially The Great Dragon, voice of the great John Hurt, who is fun, fascinating and sometimes even kind of a drama queen (king in his case).The best part has got to be Colin Morgan.  He won the British actors award in a series for season 5 even beating out Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock on Masterpiece Mysteries, and that's saying a lot because he's great.  They were thinking of doing a movie since the series was such a big hit, but Colin said ""no"" because good acting depends on diversity.  As much as I would have loved more Merlin, I think his decision says a lot about his acting abilities and future.  I could easily see him having as big a career as Daniel Day-Lewis is he choses.This is a family oriented series.  There is jousting, and lots of sword play, but NO gore.Anyway, don't miss this series no matter the cost.  You will watch it more than once if you love this kind of story.",5,"Finally, something I love more than Star Trek!",1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,1492,"['decades', 'Star', 'Trek', 'originals', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'Voyager', 'have', 'been', 'favorite', 'series', '.until', 'watched', 'Merlin', 'Netflix', 'will', 'be', 'buying', 'very', 'soon', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'stories', 'are', 'wonderful', 'well-conceived', 'written', 'Gorgeous', 'scenery', 'music', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'characters', 'grow', 'change', 'friendship', 'Merlin', 'Arthur', 'funny', 'heart-warming', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'watching', 'lovely', 'women', 'men', 'chain', 'maille', 'capes', 'riding', 'beautiful', 'horses', 'really', 'wonderful', 'places', 'Then', 'are', 'interesting', 'magical', 'creatures', 'especially', 'Great', 'Dragon', 'voice', 'great', 'John', 'Hurt', 'who', 'fun', 'fascinating', 'sometimes', 'even', 'kind', 'drama', 'queen', 'king', 'case', '.The', 'best', 'part', 'got', 'be', 'Colin', 'Morgan', 'won', 'British', 'actors', 'award', 'series', 'season', '5', 'even', 'beating', 'out', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Sherlock', 'Masterpiece', 'Mysteries', 'saying', 'lot', 'great', 'were', 'thinking', 'doing', 'movie', 'series', 'was', 'such', 'big', 'hit', 'Colin', 'said', 'because', 'good', 'acting', 'depends', 'diversity', 'As', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'more', 'Merlin', 'think', 'decision', 'lot', 'acting', 'abilities', 'future', 'could', 'easily', 'see', 'having', 'as', 'big', 'career', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'choses.This', 'family', 'oriented', 'series', 'jousting', 'lots', 'sword', 'play', 'NO', 'gore.Anyway', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'series', 'matter', 'cost', 'will', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'love', 'kind', 'story']",N/A
1641780,A14X9R4QBQZFIE,B00C4UR3PO,Kerri Williamson,"[8, 10]","We came to the round table party a bit late, but my hubby, daughters and I got quickly hooked. We plowed through all five seasons swiftly, multiple episodes night after night. We thoroughly enjoyed this series and have begun recommending it to our sons, friends and other family who haven't seen it yet. No, it's not absolutely perfect in every detail, but those little imperfections aren't even worth recalling, not for us anyway. As a quick side note, there's a good deal of lovely music throughout this as well.All in all this series was a fun ride, though quite sad at times too. This really does have heart and soul. There is genuinely some great acting/actors, an absolutely gorgeous (French) castle and (Welsh) country-side, wonderful horses and many interesting life `morals/lessons'. You could say that there are metaphors for a number of key things. Beyond many details, I quite enjoyed the old fellow who mentors Merlin. The character, the actor, was heart-warming and interesting as he fathers the boy and then advises the young man. The father/king of Arthur is a sympathetic complex character. I can't help but like Uther despite his `bad king' moments (like when innocents die). Uther definitely makes some major mistakes. Which characters don't make mistakes? Merlin, Arthur and other key characters also make mistakes and learn from some. Many of the characters grow in various ways through the series. Some of the evil characters are entirely `hate-worthy'. And sometimes, you just want to give the `good' characters a consoling hug.If you like Arthurian myths/legends, you will probably like this series, though some people might find it somewhat of a re-imagination in places. Legend purists might be peeved now and then, but we are fine to suspend our disbelief when necessary, especially since we are talking myths and legends here. If you really don't like fantasy or magic, you probably won't like this series. There is plenty of magic, a unicorn, and dragons. One of my daughters is quite a myths, languages and history buff of many years (maybe perhaps British Isles history etcetera most of all) and she enjoyed many details, particularly the old English that was spoken for the supposed magical spells and the other language influence (the dragon speak).My grandsons are coming to visit again soon, and I can't wait to share this series with them. I know they will enjoy the fabulous jousting and lively swordplay, and beyond that, the relationship interactions between the two main characters. This is a `buddy movie' series, it definitely has a deal of romance, there are many tender-hearted moments as well as jolly gags, and there's plenty of frights to make your pulse quicken, and nasty baddies to hate. You see, this is why it is fun for the entire family - something for everyone. Well, maybe not for little kids. Many fight scenes were very well done, and I couldn't get enough of the horses, but then, I'm a horse nut. There are serious moments, scary stuff and fun `comic relief' bits here and there. This is overall a family friendly `night in' at the movies. Get the popcorn ready: a perfect fit to this highly enjoyable series.Update: Our grandsons have been here for an extended visit and have been zipping through this series with us, a couple or few episodes each night. They are very invested in certain characters, loving some, hating others, as the story continues and characters change or come and go. It has been entertaining to see my grandsons' reactions to events and to see how passionate they've been getting at many points in the story. Beyond their laughing at the earlier lighter episodes that are laced with humor, they become quite serious as the series goes on and gets a bit darker. Still, throughout, we've been discussing good/bad kings/queens, political systems, freedom versus tyranny, equality, fairness, justice and other subjects that have been coming up because of the show. I thought my grandsons would like the shows, but they have been more intrigued than I had imagined that they would be. I don't know that this would be age appropriate for younger than maybe eight years old, but it's not too complex for my grandsons that age and older.",5,Family Night IN with these movies!,1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,4213,"['came', 'round', 'table', 'party', 'bit', 'late', 'hubby', 'daughters', 'got', 'quickly', 'hooked', 'plowed', 'five', 'seasons', 'swiftly', 'multiple', 'episodes', 'night', 'night', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'have', 'begun', 'recommending', 'sons', 'friends', 'other', 'family', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'No', 'not', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'detail', 'little', 'imperfections', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'worth', 'recalling', 'not', 'anyway', 'quick', 'side', 'note', 'good', 'deal', 'lovely', 'music', 'well.All', 'series', 'was', 'fun', 'ride', 'quite', 'sad', 'times', 'too', 'really', 'have', 'heart', 'soul', 'genuinely', 'great', 'acting/actors', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'French', 'castle', 'Welsh', 'country-side', 'wonderful', 'horses', 'many', 'interesting', 'life', 'morals/lessons', 'could', 'say', 'are', 'metaphors', 'number', 'key', 'things', 'Beyond', 'many', 'details', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'old', 'fellow', 'who', 'Merlin', 'character', 'actor', 'was', 'heart-warming', 'interesting', 'boy', 'then', 'young', 'man', 'father/king', 'Arthur', 'sympathetic', 'complex', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'Uther', 'bad', 'king', 'moments', 'when', 'innocents', 'die', 'definitely', 'major', 'mistakes', 'Which', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'mistakes', 'Merlin', 'Arthur', 'other', 'key', 'characters', 'also', 'make', 'mistakes', 'learn', 'Many', 'characters', 'grow', 'various', 'ways', 'series', 'evil', 'characters', 'are', 'entirely', 'hate-worthy', 'sometimes', 'just', 'want', 'give', 'good', 'characters', 'consoling', 'hug.If', 'Arthurian', 'myths/legends', 'will', 'probably', 'like', 'series', 'people', 'might', 'find', 'somewhat', 're-imagination', 'places', 'Legend', 'purists', 'might', 'be', 'peeved', 'now', 'then', 'are', 'fine', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'when', 'necessary', 'especially', 'are', 'talking', 'myths', 'here', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'fantasy', 'magic', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'series', 'plenty', 'magic', 'unicorn', 'dragons', 'One', 'daughters', 'quite', 'myths', 'languages', 'history', 'buff', 'many', 'years', 'maybe', 'perhaps', 'British', 'Isles', 'history', 'etcetera', 'most', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'details', 'particularly', 'old', 'English', 'was', 'spoken', 'supposed', 'magical', 'spells', 'other', 'language', 'influence', 'dragon', 'speak', '.My', 'grandsons', 'are', 'coming', 'visit', 'again', 'soon', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'share', 'series', 'know', 'will', 'enjoy', 'fabulous', 'jousting', 'lively', 'swordplay', 'relationship', 'interactions', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'buddy', 'movie', 'series', 'definitely', 'deal', 'romance', 'are', 'many', 'tender-hearted', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'jolly', 'gags', 'plenty', 'frights', 'make', 'pulse', 'quicken', 'nasty', 'baddies', 'hate', 'see', 'why', 'fun', 'entire', 'family', 'something', 'everyone', 'Well', 'maybe', 'not', 'little', 'kids', 'Many', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'horses', 'then', ""'m"", 'horse', 'nut', 'are', 'serious', 'moments', 'scary', 'stuff', 'fun', 'comic', 'relief', 'bits', 'here', 'there', 'overall', 'family', 'friendly', 'night', 'movies', 'Get', 'popcorn', 'ready', 'perfect', 'fit', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'series.Update', 'grandsons', 'have', 'been', 'here', 'extended', 'visit', 'have', 'been', 'zipping', 'series', 'couple', 'few', 'episodes', 'night', 'are', 'very', 'invested', 'certain', 'characters', 'loving', 'hating', 'others', 'story', 'characters', 'change', 'come', 'go', 'been', 'entertaining', 'see', 'grandsons', 'reactions', 'events', 'see', 'how', 'passionate', ""'ve"", 'been', 'getting', 'many', 'points', 'story', 'Beyond', 'laughing', 'earlier', 'lighter', 'episodes', 'are', 'laced', 'humor', 'become', 'quite', 'serious', 'series', 'bit', 'darker', 'Still', ""'ve"", 'been', 'discussing', 'good/bad', 'kings/queens', 'political', 'systems', 'freedom', 'versus', 'tyranny', 'equality', 'fairness', 'justice', 'other', 'subjects', 'have', 'been', 'coming', 'up', 'show', 'thought', 'grandsons', 'would', 'like', 'shows', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'intrigued', 'had', 'imagined', 'would', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'be', 'age', 'appropriate', 'younger', 'maybe', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'not', 'too', 'complex', 'grandsons', 'age', 'older']",N/A

I bought the seasons one at a time.  That said, I want to post one review and not five so I came here.  I watched all five seasons and enjoyed everyone of them.  Too bad this story had to end, but at least they ended with a real conclusion.But I have a strange thought that the last scene in season five may be a hint that there is more to come. I hope so.In the BBC's Merlin, we discover a Merlin that starts somewhat innocent and naive and he makes mistakes learning how to use his power and hide it as the same time, but it is those mistakes he makes and Prince/King Arthur makes that I think makes this series worth watching.And I really learned to loathe the character of Morgana.
