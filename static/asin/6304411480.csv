I'm telling you this because the ending was a real shocker for me --- wish I had been better prepared. I watched it on TV a few weeks ago and had to own it. Luckily, Amazon had it for a reasonable price.  I now like Christian Slater so much, that I bought another of of his movies (suggested by Amazon): Bed of Roses.  Can't wait for it to arrive.

To say it was sweet and yet sad does not even begin to do it justice. This movie draws you in heart and soul. You feel sorry for Adam's tragic life of being left alone as a child because of his bad heart. Then you feel bad for him because he is alone as an adult. Yet at the same time, you feel bad that Caroline can't find love or a decent guy to share time with. Then she finds Adam! When Adam saves her from two rapists, you can't help but believe that chivalry is alive again! You can see Slater and Tomei's chemistry together and they just seem to ""fit"". One of the most touching parts of the movie for me was when Caroline was cutting Adam's hair and they had a beautiful conversation and he opened his heart about being alone because the Nuns felt it better not to hurt his health by letting him be out with people. Slater did an excellent job of portraying his loneliness, but he also showed a gentleness you don't see in the movies much these days.  Adam (Slater) opens up to Caroline and she sees that he has a heart of gold. Caroline (Tomei) did an excellent job taking Adam's love and the two fell in deep! If you love romance movies, you will love this! You will be rooting for the characters all the way! This movie is one you can watch over and over again and never get tired of it.

That moment of &#34;fight or flight&#34; arises in the story that too many women have tragically been subject to, and Christian Slater plays the hero, Adam, who comes to her rescue.

420129,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6304411480,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[3, 4]","Untamed Heart was a very different offbeat romance that I enjoyed in parts, in spite of some flaws and a weak story. Christian Slater, Marisa Tomei, and Rosie Perez all gave very good performances--all cast against type. Christian Slater, especially, since instead of the usual Gen X answer to Jack Nicholson, always quick with a quip, we get an understated and tender performance, with nary even a raised eyebrow. He is not his usual smart aleck character--in fact at first you think he is totally mute--but then once he does start talking, he is literate, well read, if a bit naive. It is a bit much, I thought, like he is Adam the Magic Bus Boy, but I'm sure that lots of people were able to suspend disbelief and got totally swept up in the romantic story.--------------Adam: I wonder if you think about me.Caroline: Of course I think about you!Adam: I wasn't finished!Caroline: Finish.Adam: I wonder if you think about me half as much as I think about you.======================Marisa Tomei plays a waitress in a cafe who is looking for love, but, let's just say that she kissed a lot of frogs trying to find her Prince Charming. I was enthralled with her sweet Caroline, but the way her character was written, there were just a few things that  didn't add up. Mainly, it was her reaction to Slater's Adam the seemingly mute busboy, who sneaks into her house on Christmas and leaves a Christmas Tree for her, and then confesses that it wasn't the first time he has sneaked into her house, and by the way, he watches her sleep. She has just gone through a very traumatic experience, yet she thinks this is cute? I commend her acting all the more, making us believe her, even though the writing was weak as water.------------------Adam: I follow you home...Caroline: You follow me home?Adam: I wasn't finished.Caroline: Finish.Adam: I follow you home to make sure you're... safe.Caroline: Well I never see you.Adam: I stay pretty far behind. I'm sorry.Caroline: Well, I mean, don't be sorry... I just...Adam: I wasn't finished.Caroline: Finish.Adam: I am sorry I was late that night.============================Rosie Perez plays another waitress, and for her, it is an understated performance, too. Still, she smolders, making the most of her supporting role as the friend. I enjoyed the song Bad Bad Boys Performed by Midi, Maxi & Efti with a dance from Rosie Perez that was sexy, but rather gratuitous all the same [maybe a foreshadowing of something--not to spoil the suspense or anything].The film's weaknesses are also its strengths, as there are a lot of artistic and musical touches, like a beginning sequence with a kid (a dead ringer for Slater as a kid) in sepia tones. The sound track was quite ecclectic, with songs by Timbuk 3, Los Lobos, Suzanne Vega, Cowboy Junkies, Eddie Palmieri, among others; and the recurring musical motif of the Roger Williams version of Nature Boy (written by Eden Ahbez), and finally the Nat Cole version as credits roll.----------------------Caroline: I have fallen...Adam: Are you hurt?Caroline: I wasn't finished.Adam: Finish.Caroline: I have fallen so in love with you, so much more than I said I would.=================================The bottom line is Untamed Heart tries to tell a fable, but fables can be fickle mistresses. I really liked Christian Slater's performance, and also Marisa Tomei's. They were great together, and I commend the artistic touches and the chances the film makers took. Christian Slater, especially, tried something completely different from his usual. I loved his naive belief that the scratchy old records the nuns at the orphanage gave him were magic. Sometimes, though, the magic doesn't work. This was one of those times.----------------Caroline: Adam your heart is diseased! You need a new one.Adam: But this is my heart!

All three work in a diner where Slater is a busboy, while Tomei and Perez play waitresses.  Tomei plays Caroline, and is kind of a ditzy girl, but very sweet.  Seems she has a problem with the boys she goes out with, in that they don't treat her particularly well, cheating on her and such.  Perez plays Cindy, the more streetwise friend who tries to help Caroline out when she can, setting her up on dates, and commiserating with her when things go poorly.  Slater plays Adam, a quiet and shy person who has a crush on Caroline.  Cindy thinks Adam is mentally disabled, since he very rarely says two words, but Caroline sees him a little different, with more of an understanding attitude, but not as a romantic interest, at least at the beginning of the movie.As the movie progresses, we see Adam saving Caroline from a particularly nasty situation when she is attacked by two men on her way home from work one night.  When she finds out it was Adam that saved her and cared for her, she begins to look beneath the surface at Adam, and finds more than she expected.  She learns of his feelings for her, and they develop a relationship, and fall in love.  Actually, Adam has always been in love with Caroline, so it's just Caroline who comes around feeling for Adam what he feels for her.  In getting to know Adam, Caroline learns that Adam was an orphan with a weak heart, and the nuns in the orphanage gave him some story about him having a baboon heart, which he still believed to this day.  Their relationship is very sweet, as we see Adam's unrequited love fulfill, and Caroline finds someone who treats her the way she should be treated, the way anybody should be treated, with love, caring, thoughtfulness, and respect.  Well, things are going really well, until the two guys that attacked Caroline and were subsequently beat up by Adam show up again and are looking for revenge on Adam.  I don't want to go any further, as that would spoil things for someone who hasn't seen this yet, but I really liked how this movie ended.I guess one of the reasons I like this movie so much is I could kind of identify with Slater's character, being awkward and shy myself in school.  I know how it was to have a deep crush on someone, and yet not be able to bring yourself to tell that person how you feel.  Sometimes it can be difficult to keep that kind of thing inside, but then if you let it out, there is a good chance that you may spoil the fantasy with the harsh reality.  There were one or two points in the movie when I did tear up a little, and that doesn't happen often for me while watching movies (Old Yeller, Pride of the Yankees, Goodbye Mr. Chips).  Slater plays his character well, and Tomei is incredibly cute and seems to pull off the sort of ditzy, but sweet and caring girl quite well.  Perez also does a good job in her role.  A sweet and sappy movie, for sure, but very watchable.

420132,A2FDFWRBCU8ERY,6304411480,Daddy,"[0, 0]","I truly like Christian Slater as an actor. Unfortunately, most of the roles he is put in are forgettable supporting or sideline characters. However, in this movie, he shines as the central figure.  Slater plays Adam, a very reserved and deep young man who works at a diner as a bus boy.  He grew up an orphan and believes he has a baboon's heart (from heart surgery as a child).  He lives in a tiny basement apartment, is very quiet, never speaks to anyone, and keeps to himself.  Meanwhile, Caroline (Marisa Tomei), a waitress at the diner, becomes his friend and eventually gets him to open up to her.  He becomes infatuated with her because she is so kind to him.  But, she doesn't fall for him until he saves her from being raped one night.  They begin a spiritual and tender romance, with Adam opening up to Caroline more and more; like when he tells her the way his records make him feel when he plays them.  A good insight into Adam is the simple reply he gives when Caroline sees that he has a dog, and asks ""What's his name?"" to which Adam replies ""I don't know. He hasn't told me.""  Slater is particularly endearing and intensely soulful in his performance.

420142,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6304411480,Lawyeraau,"[39, 40]","This film is an unlikely romance that works on many levels. Deftly directed by Tony Bill who shows a penchant for handling delicate sentiments as if they were gossamer threads, this film is truly one of the most  romantic that I have seen. That this is so, despite the fact that many of the most romantic moments take place in a downtown Minneapolis diner, a dingy basement apartment,  the front porch of a house in a blue collar, working class neighborhood, or in an old dilapidated clunker of a car, is a testament to the ability of the director.Marisa Tomei is luminous as  Caroline, the Minneapolis waitress with self-esteem problems who looks for love in all the wrong places, before finding it right where she works. She imbues Caroline with just the right measure of street smarts, working class edge, and little girl vulnerability. She is a needy, though nice, young woman who desperately wants to love and be loved.  Unfortunately, the guys she meets tend to treat her as a one night stand. Sensitive and romantic Adam, the reticent and quirky busboy who works the night shift with Caroline, is just what the doctor ordered.As Adam, Caroline's veritable knight in shining armor, Christian Slater gives his best performance ever. An orphan with a disability that he cloaks with an intriguing story, Adam is a true romantic hero. His quiet sincerity, delicate sensibilities, and apparent contentment in worshipping from afar touch Caroline, tugging at her heart strings. You see, he treats her as if she were a princess rather than as a strumpet.  Christian Slater's sensitive and moving performance in a difficult role strikes just the right note. I would bet that nearly every woman who watches this film succumbs to his charms and finds herself half falling in love with him.The film seems to tell the viewer that once one has love in one's grasp, hold it tightly, as one never knows what the fates may have in store. Though the ending may be somewhat predictable, it will not stop the viewer from needing a hanky. This is a wonderful film that will greatly appeal to those viewers with a romantic streak in their hearts.

420149,AMZYAGVDQWTS,6304411480,Reviews No More,"[3, 33]","This has to be one of the worst ""romantic"" movies I've ever seen.  From the very beginning, you know you're in for punishment just because Marisa Tomei's character Caroline is such a ditz, and only a ditz would fall for another of her kind.  Christian Slater as Adam is totally unbelievable.  Come on, nobody is that dumb...are they?  All old spaghetti face does is mope and whine about why ""this always happens to me"" as Rosie Perez turns her Mistah Kottah accent up to an annoying eleven throughout the entire film.  ""I'd doooo 'im if he wasn't so **** dumb!""  Yeah, sweetheart, and if you were a rocket scientist you wouldn't be fencing with your girlfriend in a diner with flyswatters.  Best you start jumping Adam's ribs right now.Wow, this is a really shallow and stupid story that just goes from bad to worse.  Adam has a bad heart, and he actually grows up believing the nuns' goofy stories about how he had a baboon's heart, so he thinks nothing of fighting some creeps who try to rape Caroline after her shift is over at the restaurant.  The result?  She falls in love with a guy who's dumber than a box of rocks and lives with his dog under a bridge.Throughout the film, we are pummeled with horrible dialogue.  For example:  ""I have fallen!""  ""Did you hurt yourself?""  Ugh, I think I'm going to spew chunks!  Worst of all, Dum-Dum doesn't know what a hockey puck is, yet he catches a flying one in his hand without breaking something or screaming out in pain, and hands it to Caroline.  Have you had enough?  Not only do Tomei and Slater make a highly mismatched couple in this badly written excuse for a romance, but their chemistry--and I use the term loosely--couldn't cover a ritz cracker with the aid of a good knife.

420154,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,6304411480,Scott Schiefelbein,"[9, 9]","For those of us who have already ""met"" Christian Slater and Marisa Tomei in their star-making roles, ""Untamed Heart"" offers a series of pleasant surprises to go along with a tear-jerker of a plot.Slater has made a career out of channeling Jack Nicholson into Generation X roles in such movies as ""Heathers"" and ""True Romance"" (which also came out in 1993, at the same time as ""Untamed Heart"").  In these movies, Slater is the smart-*ss with the devilish grin and irresistable command of the quip.  Adam, his role in ""Untamed Heart,"" could not be a further departure from Clarence of ""True Romance.""  An orphan with a weak heart, Adam speaks seldom but feels deeply, even though he's never had a relationship with a woman.  As a busboy and janitor for a small-time Minneapolis diner, he falls in a big way for Carolina (Marisa Tomei), a waitress at the diner.  But even though Adam feels big feelings for Caroline, Slater wisely restrains himself - I don't think we even get a single arched eyebrow!Caroline is also a departure for Tomei from the wise-cracking Noo Yawka she played in her career-making ""My Cousin Vinnie.""  Caroline is one of those girls everyone knows in high school but never appears in the movies -- a cute gal whose talents lie buried under massive self-esteem issues.  Soft-spoken except with her family and fellow waitresses, Caroline is forever starting ventures but never finishing them.  We also get the sense that Caroline has gotten ""familiar"" with a lotta guys over the years.Adam thwarts an ugly attempted rape as two guys ""escort"" Caroline home on a chilly night.  In a lesser movie, Caroline would have instantly jumped into the sack with her hero to ""reward"" him for his chivalry, but Caroline regards Adam with a confused wariness that's quite believable.  This reserve gradually melts, and soon Adam and Caroline are engaged in a very serious courtship -- Caroline is serious about Adam because he seems genuine, and Adam is serious about Caroline because he's incapable of being any other way.These two characters truly merge on-screen into a believable couple, and their dialogue, while unusual, never ring false or contrived.  Indeed, this movie rings true with all the hallmarks of ""regular folks"" just getting by with their daily lives.  Even though it's set in Minnesota and has a few laughs, don't go looking for ""Fargo""-style humor about Minnesotans.  Even Rosie Perez, who can go as broad as humanly possible with the stereotypical Latina behavior, dials it down a notch or two in her role as Caroline's best friend, Cindy.  Notice the look in her eye when she tells Caroline that Adam is, in a sense, ""sponge-worthy.""  Even though it's funny, she doesn't really play it for laughs -- this is the kind of evaluation that occurs when you're closing up on the graveyard shift at the local diner.A restrained ""chick flick,"" ""Untamed Heart"" is a must for the film library if you're a fan of ""weepies"" (you know, ""Terms of Endearment,"" ""Love Story,"" and the like).  While I'm not a huge fan of the sub-genre of romance films, I have to say that ""Untamed Heart"" offered a surprising amount of truth in its well-drawn, well-acted characters.  (The soundtrack offers a lot of gems, too, including the Cowboy Junkies doing ""Moon River.  A big clue as to the movie's plot comes from the constant use of ""Nature Boy"" from ""Moulin Rouge,"" too.)",4,Quiet Little Flick Nevertheless a Romantic Charmer,1120521600,"07 5, 2005",2005,3375,"['who', 'have', 'already', 'met', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'star-making', 'roles', 'Untamed', 'Heart', 'series', 'pleasant', 'surprises', 'go', 'along', 'tear-jerker', 'plot.Slater', 'made', 'career', 'channeling', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Generation', 'X', 'roles', 'such', 'movies', 'Heathers', 'True', 'Romance', 'also', 'came', 'out', '1993', 'same', 'time', 'Untamed', 'Heart', 'movies', 'Slater', 'smart-*ss', 'devilish', 'grin', 'irresistable', 'command', 'quip', 'Adam', 'role', 'Untamed', 'Heart', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'further', 'departure', 'Clarence', 'True', 'Romance', 'orphan', 'weak', 'heart', 'Adam', 'seldom', 'feels', 'deeply', 'even', 'never', 'had', 'relationship', 'woman', 'busboy', 'janitor', 'small-time', 'Minneapolis', 'diner', 'big', 'way', 'Carolina', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'waitress', 'diner', 'even', 'Adam', 'feels', 'big', 'feelings', 'Caroline', 'Slater', 'wisely', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'even', 'get', 'single', 'arched', 'eyebrow', 'Caroline', 'also', 'departure', 'Tomei', 'wise-cracking', 'Noo', 'Yawka', 'played', 'career-making', 'Cousin', 'Vinnie', 'Caroline', 'one', 'girls', 'everyone', 'high', 'school', 'never', 'movies', 'cute', 'gal', 'talents', 'lie', 'buried', 'massive', 'self-esteem', 'issues', 'Soft-spoken', 'family', 'fellow', 'waitresses', 'Caroline', 'forever', 'starting', 'ventures', 'never', 'finishing', 'also', 'get', 'sense', 'Caroline', 'gotten', 'familiar', 'lotta', 'guys', 'years.Adam', 'ugly', 'attempted', 'rape', 'two', 'guys', 'escort', 'Caroline', 'home', 'chilly', 'night', 'lesser', 'movie', 'Caroline', 'would', 'have', 'instantly', 'jumped', 'sack', 'hero', 'reward', 'chivalry', 'Caroline', 'regards', 'Adam', 'confused', 'wariness', 'quite', 'believable', 'reserve', 'gradually', 'melts', 'soon', 'Adam', 'Caroline', 'are', 'engaged', 'very', 'serious', 'courtship', 'Caroline', 'serious', 'Adam', 'genuine', 'Adam', 'serious', 'Caroline', 'incapable', 'being', 'other', 'way.These', 'two', 'characters', 'truly', 'merge', 'on-screen', 'believable', 'couple', 'dialogue', 'unusual', 'never', 'ring', 'false', 'contrived', 'Indeed', 'movie', 'true', 'hallmarks', 'regular', 'folks', 'just', 'getting', 'daily', 'lives', 'Even', 'set', 'Minnesota', 'few', 'laughs', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'looking', 'Fargo', '-style', 'humor', 'Minnesotans', 'Even', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'who', 'can', 'go', 'as', 'broad', 'humanly', 'possible', 'stereotypical', 'Latina', 'behavior', 'down', 'notch', 'two', 'role', 'Caroline', 'best', 'friend', 'Cindy', 'Notice', 'look', 'eye', 'when', 'Caroline', 'Adam', 'sense', 'sponge-worthy', 'Even', 'funny', ""n't"", 'really', 'play', 'kind', 'evaluation', 'when', ""'re"", 'closing', 'up', 'graveyard', 'shift', 'local', 'diner.A', 'restrained', 'chick', 'flick', 'Untamed', 'Heart', 'must', 'film', 'library', ""'re"", 'fan', 'weepies', 'know', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'Love', 'Story', 'like', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'sub-genre', 'romance', 'films', 'have', 'say', 'Untamed', 'Heart', 'offered', 'surprising', 'amount', 'truth', 'well-drawn', 'well-acted', 'characters', 'soundtrack', 'lot', 'gems', 'too', 'including', 'Cowboy', 'Junkies', 'doing', 'Moon', 'River', 'big', 'clue', 'movie', 'plot', 'constant', 'use', 'Nature', 'Boy', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'too']",N/A

420156,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,6304411480,Steffan Piper,"[4, 4]","So a lot of folks come away with a lot of mixed feelings regarding this movie. Ok, understood. Some people say that `On The Road' was boring and that they didn't get it. Not all the great masterpieces are appealing to everyone. But I think the problem is that you have to see this movie during a point of quiet, and when you're not expecting it. That's when books and films have a way of sneaking up on a person and hitting you over the head for all they're worth.Untamed Heart was a film that came out when the market was already flooded with similar films, but with different messages, but none as endearing and honest. Young actors weren't in short supply by any means either. Independent Film was being given a second wind, too by younger and more eager Directors than the ones making multi-million dollar big budget pictures. A lot of those films have faded away, and yet this movie still has a credible amount of relevance and a striking amount of nostalgia and appeal.The most interesting thing about this though is that this was a one-hit wonder in terms of writing by Tom Sierchio. The story is so well developed that it unfolds as if it were an adaptation from a best-seller. Snooping the internet, looking for information about his whereabouts, one comes up dry, realizing this was all that there was, and nothing more. The other possibility is that this film was ghost-written by someone else more famous and for whatever reasons 'Tom Sierchio' was the name given credit for the screenwriting. This kind of thing does happen from time to time as David Mamet has kept his name off of a few films and other well-known writers and Writer-cum-celeb's have done the same. Until someone posts a message about 'Tom Sierchio', I'm going with the latter of the ideas.Untamed Heart is probably the closing arc of Christian Slater's early career, what he does now is anybody's guess, but to say that he squandered his fame and his carte-blanche is an understatement. It's strange to imagine that he worked on this film directly after coming off the set of the violent and over-the-top True Romance. Most of the reviews here, and on other sites, like Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb, all state that this film encapsulates Slater's best film performance by far. It's hard to disagree, even if you're a fan of Pump up The Volume, Heathers or True Romance. It's easy to be out of control, but harder to be serene, on camera or off. Just look how most people live their lives and consider how most people would like to live their lives.The music is also stand out and signature. Several of the songs played will probably forever remind those that have seen this movie of Untamed Heart, Suzanne Vega's Tom's Diner and Nat King Cole's Nature Boy are the most prevalent.",5,Magic Records and a Baboon Heart ...,1207958400,"04 12, 2008",2008,2756,"['So', 'lot', 'folks', 'come', 'away', 'lot', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'regarding', 'movie', 'Ok', 'understood', 'people', 'say', 'Road', 'was', 'boring', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Not', 'great', 'masterpieces', 'are', 'appealing', 'everyone', 'think', 'problem', 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'point', 'quiet', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'expecting', 'when', 'books', 'films', 'have', 'way', 'sneaking', 'up', 'person', 'hitting', 'head', ""'re"", 'worth.Untamed', 'Heart', 'was', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'when', 'market', 'was', 'already', 'flooded', 'similar', 'films', 'different', 'messages', 'none', 'endearing', 'honest', 'Young', 'actors', 'were', ""n't"", 'short', 'supply', 'means', 'Independent', 'Film', 'was', 'being', 'given', 'second', 'wind', 'too', 'younger', 'more', 'eager', 'Directors', 'ones', 'making', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'big', 'budget', 'pictures', 'lot', 'films', 'have', 'faded', 'away', 'yet', 'movie', 'still', 'credible', 'amount', 'relevance', 'striking', 'amount', 'nostalgia', 'most', 'interesting', 'thing', 'though', 'was', 'one-hit', 'wonder', 'terms', 'writing', 'Tom', 'Sierchio', 'story', 'so', 'well', 'were', 'adaptation', 'best-seller', 'Snooping', 'internet', 'looking', 'information', 'whereabouts', 'one', 'up', 'dry', 'realizing', 'was', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'other', 'possibility', 'film', 'was', 'ghost-written', 'someone', 'else', 'more', 'famous', 'reasons', ""'Tom"", 'Sierchio', 'was', 'name', 'given', 'credit', 'screenwriting', 'kind', 'thing', 'happen', 'time', 'time', 'David', 'Mamet', 'kept', 'name', 'few', 'films', 'other', 'well-known', 'writers', 'Writer-cum-celeb', 'have', 'done', 'same', 'someone', 'message', ""'Tom"", 'Sierchio', ""'m"", 'going', 'latter', 'ideas.Untamed', 'Heart', 'probably', 'closing', 'arc', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'early', 'career', 'what', 'now', 'anybody', 'guess', 'say', 'squandered', 'fame', 'carte-blanche', 'understatement', 'strange', 'imagine', 'worked', 'film', 'directly', 'coming', 'off', 'set', 'violent', 'over-the-top', 'True', 'Romance', 'Most', 'reviews', 'here', 'other', 'sites', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'IMDb', 'state', 'film', 'Slater', 'best', 'film', 'performance', 'far', 'hard', 'disagree', 'even', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Pump', 'Volume', 'Heathers', 'True', 'Romance', 'easy', 'be', 'control', 'harder', 'be', 'serene', 'camera', 'Just', 'look', 'how', 'most', 'people', 'live', 'lives', 'consider', 'how', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'like', 'live', 'lives.The', 'music', 'also', 'stand', 'out', 'signature', 'Several', 'songs', 'played', 'will', 'probably', 'forever', 'remind', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'Untamed', 'Heart', 'Suzanne', 'Vega', 'Tom', 'Diner', 'Nat', 'King', 'Cole', 'Nature', 'Boy', 'are', 'most', 'prevalent']",N/A

I love the simple, working-class characters (no fancy houses or cars or sets) and their stories. Caroline (Tomei) is adorable, spunky, vulnerable, and endearing. Adam (Slater) is believably shy, awkward, and socially clumsy, yet valiant and generous at heart. This is not a romantic comedy, and this is not a feel-good, bubbly romantic story. This story is sad and touching and sweet, from beginning to end. It has moments of romance, humor, sadness, drama... but it doesn't fit into any one category. It's REAL... just like real life has all sorts of moments and themes. I love the quiet, unhurried pace of the story. Lines aren't rushed, you don't have clever quips coming like rapid gunfire, there's plenty of silence, much of the story is told through observing subtle movements and facial expressions.

420163,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6304411480,Wuchak,"[3, 3]","Released in 1993, ""Untamed Heart"" tells the story of Caroline (Marisa Tomei) who works the night shift at a Minneapolis diner. She's a beautiful and likable young woman but, for some reason, is unable to maintain the romantic interest of the guys she dates. The answer to her love problems turns out to be right under her nose in the form of the diner's quiet dishwasher/janitor, Adam (Christian Slater).""Untamed Heart"" is a must for fans of Marisa Tomei (see the film and you'll see why) and the romance between Caroline and Adam works, although their sexual union is premature IMHO, but real-time has to be condensed into a 102-minute film so I guess it can be overlooked.What struck me most about this film, aside from Marisa, was the character of Adam. He's an outcast; he doesn't fit with the crowd; he's quiet and mysterious in a misfit type of way; he's an easy target for people to mock; he's content to adore Caroline from a distance; his love for her doesn't change as she keeps making mistakes trying to find someone to love; he secretly acts as her guardian angel and doesn't care about getting credit.Why is Caroline attracted to such a person? Because ""opposites attract."" We're naturally attracted to people that have what we lack and vice versa. Caroline is open, talkative and comfortable with practically any social setting; Adam isn't. Adam is aloof, meditative and unconcerned about fitting in -- qualities Caroline lacks.You'll see people like Adam in real life if you open your eyes. At a local restaurant I sometimes catch a glimpse of one of the kitchen workers, whether taking a smoke break outside or whatever. He's in his mid-30s, maybe older, obviously intelligent with a striking appearance, but he's quiet and aloof from the people around him, with an air of mystery. This is a person, like Adam in the film, who doesn't fit into society's mold -- college doesn't work for him despite his intelligence, nor does a conventional job; he just does what he has to to live.The film is very successful at bringing to life this type of outcast in the character of Adam. I found it quite moving. I understand and can relate.Not everything in the story works, however, which is why I knock off a star in my rating. For instance, it isn't even remotely believable that Adam would be able to secretly break into Marisa's house and set up a Christmas tree in her bedroom while she's sleeping, especially in light of the fact that there are other family members sleeping there as well. Dumb. What were the writers thinking?The film was shot on location in NE Minneapolis.",4,Moving portrait of an outcast,1236124800,"03 4, 2009",2009,2588,"['Released', '1993', 'Untamed', 'Heart', 'story', 'Caroline', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'who', 'night', 'shift', 'Minneapolis', 'diner', 'beautiful', 'likable', 'young', 'woman', 'reason', 'unable', 'maintain', 'romantic', 'interest', 'guys', 'answer', 'love', 'problems', 'out', 'be', 'right', 'nose', 'form', 'diner', 'quiet', 'dishwasher/janitor', 'Adam', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Untamed', 'Heart', 'must', 'fans', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'see', 'film', ""'ll"", 'see', 'why', 'romance', 'Caroline', 'Adam', 'works', 'sexual', 'union', 'premature', 'IMHO', 'real-time', 'be', 'condensed', '102-minute', 'film', 'guess', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked.What', 'struck', 'most', 'film', 'aside', 'Marisa', 'was', 'character', 'Adam', 'outcast', ""n't"", 'fit', 'crowd', 'quiet', 'mysterious', 'misfit', 'type', 'way', 'easy', 'target', 'people', 'mock', 'content', 'adore', 'Caroline', 'distance', 'love', ""n't"", 'change', 'making', 'mistakes', 'trying', 'find', 'someone', 'love', 'secretly', 'guardian', 'angel', ""n't"", 'care', 'getting', 'credit.Why', 'Caroline', 'attracted', 'such', 'person', 'opposites', 'attract', ""'re"", 'naturally', 'attracted', 'people', 'have', 'what', 'lack', 'vice', 'versa', 'Caroline', 'open', 'talkative', 'comfortable', 'practically', 'social', 'setting', 'Adam', ""n't"", 'Adam', 'aloof', 'meditative', 'unconcerned', 'fitting', 'qualities', 'Caroline', 'lacks.You', ""'ll"", 'see', 'people', 'Adam', 'real', 'life', 'open', 'eyes', 'local', 'restaurant', 'sometimes', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'one', 'kitchen', 'workers', 'taking', 'smoke', 'break', 'mid-30s', 'maybe', 'older', 'obviously', 'intelligent', 'striking', 'appearance', 'quiet', 'aloof', 'people', 'air', 'mystery', 'person', 'Adam', 'film', 'who', ""n't"", 'fit', 'society', 'mold', 'college', ""n't"", 'work', 'intelligence', 'conventional', 'job', 'just', 'what', 'live.The', 'film', 'very', 'successful', 'bringing', 'life', 'type', 'outcast', 'character', 'Adam', 'found', 'quite', 'moving', 'understand', 'can', 'relate.Not', 'everything', 'story', 'however', 'why', 'knock', 'off', 'star', 'rating', 'instance', ""n't"", 'even', 'remotely', 'believable', 'Adam', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'secretly', 'break', 'Marisa', 'house', 'set', 'up', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'bedroom', 'sleeping', 'especially', 'light', 'fact', 'are', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'sleeping', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'Dumb', 'What', 'were', 'writers', 'thinking', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'NE', 'Minneapolis']",N/A
420164,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,6304411480,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","Couldn't resist the pun there:) This is an old-time bittersweet love story that tugs at one's heartstrings. Marisa Tomei plays waitress Caroline, who can't seem to find a nice guy. The ones she does date are jerks, using her as one-night stands, and she can't fathom why she's treated so badly. One night, one her way home from work, Carolina is attacked by two guys who had earlier met her at the diner she works in - fortunately, Adam the busboy from the diner [Christian Slater] happens along and rescues her.Adam is a bit of a recluse - he hardly ever speaks, and maintains a low profile at the diner. Initially Caroline keeps her distance from him, but eventually gets drawn to Adam's sweet and vulnerable disposition and discovers that Adam is drawn to her too. Thus two rather emotionally stunted people reach out to each other and find a real connection that transcends everything else. However [as in many classic love stories], the pair's happiness is threatened by outside factors beyond their control and the rest of the movie deals with this.I felt that Marisa Tomei's performance as the emotionally vulnerable Caroline was spot-on, eliciting one's sympathy whilst also being frustrated by her lack of real goals in life. Christian Slater [who also delivered a compelling performance in ""Bed of Roses""] is subtle and credible in his portrayal as the quiet and unassuming Adam who has spent the greater part of his life hiding his true emotions, but whose love for Caroline [and her love for him], brings him alive. The leads are convincing in their roles and the chemistry between the pair is credible too. Speaking of performances, Rosie Perez delivers a good turn as Caroline's sharp-tongued fellow waitress and best friend.""Untamed Heart"" is a bitterweet love story that will appeal to fans of romance dramas.",4,Bittersweet love story with plenty of heart.,1242345600,"05 15, 2009",2009,1825,"['Could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'pun', 'there', 'old-time', 'bittersweet', 'love', 'story', 'tugs', 'one', 'heartstrings', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'waitress', 'Caroline', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'nice', 'guy', 'ones', 'date', 'are', 'jerks', 'using', 'one-night', 'stands', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fathom', 'why', 'treated', 'so', 'badly', 'One', 'night', 'one', 'way', 'home', 'work', 'Carolina', 'attacked', 'two', 'guys', 'who', 'had', 'earlier', 'met', 'diner', 'fortunately', 'Adam', 'busboy', 'diner', '[', 'Christian', 'Slater', ']', 'along', 'rescues', 'her.Adam', 'bit', 'recluse', 'hardly', 'ever', 'low', 'profile', 'diner', 'Initially', 'Caroline', 'distance', 'eventually', 'drawn', 'Adam', 'sweet', 'vulnerable', 'disposition', 'discovers', 'Adam', 'drawn', 'too', 'Thus', 'two', 'rather', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'people', 'reach', 'other', 'find', 'real', 'connection', 'everything', 'else', 'However', '[', 'many', 'classic', 'love', 'stories', ']', 'pair', 'happiness', 'threatened', 'outside', 'factors', 'control', 'rest', 'movie', 'deals', 'this.I', 'felt', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'performance', 'emotionally', 'vulnerable', 'Caroline', 'was', 'spot-on', 'eliciting', 'one', 'sympathy', 'whilst', 'also', 'being', 'frustrated', 'lack', 'real', 'goals', 'life', 'Christian', 'Slater', '[', 'who', 'also', 'delivered', 'compelling', 'performance', 'Bed', 'Roses', ']', 'subtle', 'credible', 'portrayal', 'quiet', 'unassuming', 'Adam', 'who', 'spent', 'greater', 'part', 'life', 'hiding', 'true', 'emotions', 'love', 'Caroline', '[', 'love', ']', 'alive', 'leads', 'are', 'convincing', 'roles', 'chemistry', 'pair', 'credible', 'too', 'Speaking', 'performances', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'good', 'turn', 'Caroline', 'sharp-tongued', 'fellow', 'waitress', 'best', 'friend', 'Untamed', 'Heart', 'bitterweet', 'love', 'story', 'will', 'appeal', 'fans', 'romance', 'dramas']",N/A
