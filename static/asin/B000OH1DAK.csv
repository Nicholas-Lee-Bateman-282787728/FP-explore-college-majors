The background information is correct about the shocking sale of a boy's laborfor several years in a sulfur mine, during the 1930s.  The nudity in this DVD is a historic fact forlabor in such a mine due to the high temperatures and humidity - just a waist string and a flap in thefront to protect the crouch.  In the Mediterranean regions, pedophile behaviors have quite a tragichistory for boys sold into indentured servitude in a mine where they are at the behest of other men.The conclusion is quite succinct to emphasize, Acla, like so many other boys sold into indenture, hadno future.The DVD arrived with a cracked, damage cover.

It exposes the endless cycle of religious hypocracy and poverty that allowed it to sacrifice generations of children.Those who toiled in the sulfur mines had no access to their wives and family for 24/6. Both men and boys shared a communal sleeping chamber where the weak were subject to the spector of sexual abuse on and off the job.The only thing that kept this film from getting 5-stars from me was the dialogue. At times, the dialogue was stiff and it seemed as if the actors were reciting their lines. I would highly recommend this movie for viewing for those who want to understand why conditions that the film presented could exist.",4,Descent into hell,1194739200,"11 11, 2007",2007,760,"['film', 'was', 'inspired', 'true', 'events', 'unflinching', 'exploration', 'social', 'mores', 'disturbing', 'sexual', 'practices', 'endless', 'cycle', 'religious', 'hypocracy', 'poverty', 'allowed', 'sacrifice', 'generations', 'children.Those', 'who', 'toiled', 'sulfur', 'mines', 'had', 'access', 'wives', 'family', '24/6', 'men', 'boys', 'shared', 'communal', 'sleeping', 'chamber', 'where', 'weak', 'were', 'subject', 'spector', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'job.The', 'only', 'thing', 'kept', 'film', 'getting', '5-stars', 'was', 'dialogue', 'times', 'dialogue', 'was', 'stiff', 'seemed', 'actors', 'were', 'reciting', 'lines', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'viewing', 'who', 'want', 'understand', 'why', 'conditions', 'film', 'presented', 'could', 'exist']",Acla's Descent into Floristella (La Discesa di Aclà a Floristella)
