This is much harder than the typical family films we associate with Disney, without losing the quality. Young Mackenzie Astin (son of John) gives a great performance as a seemingly naive yet brave boy who enters a dog sled race to get the 10,000 he desperately needs to go to college. Nominal star Kevin Spacey wisely remains in the background and lets this young lad shine through. The story has a number of unexpected twists, that interest and delight throughout the movie. Who are Will's friends? Who can he trust? Will he stop to save a man's life if it means losing the race?

The acting isn't bad overall, and the adventure and scenery and photography are great.* * * NOTE: Some Spoilers ahead * * *I missed some of the begining, but from where I came in, I could tell that the story was predictable, and the ending, where he wins by a mere few inches and only a second or so, because the crowd takes up whistling his tune, which gets him and his dogs moving again, was ... too much to take, I think. Maybe okay for kids, but too melodramatic for adults.Yet ... it's nice that movies like this are still being made, and it's nice that when the bad guy gets attacked by dogs, instead of being killed, the hero shoots his gun to scare off the dogs and save the evil Swede.Plus, the hero holds off shooting his (thought-to-be-mortally-) wounded dog, Gus ... and ends up taking him to the finish -- or, rather, Gus takes him to the finish.Sadly, or maybe understandably, Kevin Spacey didn't seem particularly believable or enthusiastic in his part.But, despite the negative things that can be said about this film, it is, I think, a good family and children's film, with a minimum of violence, though enough to engender excitement and add realism. It teaches good values and lessons, and even though the characters are pretty formulaic and predictable such that you know pretty much where this picture is going to go and how it's going to end up, it's an enjoyable and pretty film -- and you can really feel the snow and cold!If I had young children, I'd definitely buy it for my DVD collection.",3,Enjoyable,1021161600,"05 12, 2002",2002,1655,"['one', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'film', 'classic', 'Disney', 'adventure', 'films', 'old', 'was', 'born', '1952', 'went', 'many', 'kid', 'acting', ""n't"", 'bad', 'overall', 'adventure', 'scenery', 'photography', 'are', 'great', '*', '*', '*', 'NOTE', 'Spoilers', 'ahead', '*', '*', '*I', 'missed', 'begining', 'where', 'came', 'could', 'tell', 'story', 'was', 'predictable', 'ending', 'where', 'mere', 'few', 'inches', 'only', 'second', 'so', 'crowd', 'up', 'whistling', 'tune', 'dogs', 'moving', 'again', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'take', 'think', 'Maybe', 'okay', 'kids', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'adults.Yet', 'nice', 'movies', 'are', 'still', 'being', 'made', 'nice', 'when', 'bad', 'guy', 'attacked', 'dogs', 'instead', 'being', 'killed', 'hero', 'shoots', 'gun', 'scare', 'off', 'dogs', 'save', 'evil', 'Swede.Plus', 'hero', 'shooting', 'thought-to-be-mortally-', 'wounded', 'dog', 'Gus', 'up', 'taking', 'finish', 'rather', 'Gus', 'finish.Sadly', 'maybe', 'understandably', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'particularly', 'believable', 'enthusiastic', 'part.But', 'negative', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'think', 'good', 'family', 'children', 'film', 'minimum', 'violence', 'though', 'enough', 'engender', 'excitement', 'add', 'realism', 'good', 'values', 'lessons', 'even', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'formulaic', 'predictable', 'such', 'know', 'pretty', 'much', 'where', 'picture', 'going', 'go', 'how', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'enjoyable', 'pretty', 'film', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'snow', 'cold', 'had', 'young', 'children', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'buy', 'DVD', 'collection']",Iron Will VHS

357140,A319SKSB556033,6303109918,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[4, 5]","There's no denying that Disney have went horribly astray in recent years, churning out pure garbage that even the most deluded of families find appalling, and all in the name of political correctness. Walt built the studio and his reputation on taking risks and pushing boundaries through the right of free speech. But the Disney label now seems to be ashamed of its past and leans toward conservative values. They have all but erased their ""racist"" film Song of the South from existence and show little, if any, of the courage and nerve Walt thrived upon in the 30s and 40s. I'm not sure what has provoked this alarming shift in quality from a once flawless studio. Perhaps they think that every mother out there shelters every one of her children against any and all things that can possibly contaminate their fragile minds and only the trusted House of the Mouse knows what's best.Set in 1917 the story follows Will Stoneman (Mackenzie Astin, looking like Sean Patrick Flannery) a boy who dreams of saving the family farm and going to college. But his only chance of doing so is by winning $10,000 in a cross country dog-sled race. With little training and overwhelming odds against him he throws himself head-first into the race despite the adversity.It's a great movie for those who love adventure, escapism, choo-choo trains, period settings and Huskies. I'm not keen on dogs in the slightest but Huskies are lovely.Kevin Spacey and Brian Cox (as old then as he is now as the man was born middle-aged) provide good support but the movie belongs to Astin, who somehow hasn't achieved the level of fame his brother has. His acting skills are certainly not in doubt and this movie proves he's a good lead.Iron Will is a perfect example of how far Disney has fallen in the past decade.

Two-time Oscar winner Kevin Spacey is a high point of the movie but his character falls victim to too many cliches.  At the beginning of the movie Spacey's character doesn't give a damn about Will Stoneman (Mackenzie Astin) or what his motivations are.  He just wants to sell newspapers.  However in the end he comes to realize his initial thoughts were wrong and grows to support Will (Yawn).  Then you have the ""evil"" character who tries to intimidate Will with cornball dialogue.  Then (Surprise!) Mr. ""evil"" cheats often during the race and is horribly abusive to his sled dogs.  The final scenes of Will's hard fought victory were meant to be inspiring, but also felt like a tired plot device recycled yet again.  The one thing that I liked the most in the movie were the sled dogs.  Being a huge fan of the Siberian Husky (and an owner of one too) a smile was always on my face when I saw the magnificent dogs.

Here, praise for such an accomplishment must fall on the shoulders of Kevin Spacey.  I didn't realize he was in this film until I checked the cast list online (Oh right...I'm gonna sit around for the credits).  But Mr. Spacey is one of many people worth praising for this unexpected good time.  Mackenzie Astin plays Will Stoneman, a boy who, after the accidental death of his father, becomes determined to save his family's farm as his old man had planned to by entering a sled dog race stretching from Winnipeg, Canada, to Saint Paul, Minnesota.  While it is a story about the determination of the underdog, a tale we've heard so often before, it is still endearing...maybe it's because I'm actually a fan of the sport or because this movie helped make me a fan...who knows.  While some of the opponents were over-to-the-top either in meanness, cruelty, or just plain doubt, the rigger of the competition could be felt.  While the ending was pretty predictable, it is nice to see the advice of Will's father's Native American friend, Ned Dodd, played by August Schellenberg, come full-circle.  Perhaps it is just the underdog story we need every so often and that would then be why it is such an unexpectedly worthwhile film.

Now I think it's a good movie if you take some things out of it.For example, the music annoyed the guano out of me. The music kept swelling and swelling, forcing me to keep the remote in my hand so I could turn the volume down. It was completely unnecessary to have the music cue an emotional response every few minutes. It added nothing to the story.Another thing that bothers me is this movie was very stereotypical. The Newspapers and Railroad men exploited the people, flaunting their money and using it to get all the little guys to scramble for it. The German was a villain (whose evil ways eventually did him in), the Norwegian was neutral (who was defeated by the German), and the American was a hero (who could not be defeated by the German) but was picked on because of his youth and inexperience. This is something all Disney movies seem to say, that if only you give kids a chance, they'll do better than the lot of you, so stop holding them back!I wonder why Disney hates parents so much. I think it's actual hatred, as Disney kills off parents left and right. In Finding Nemo, Disney kills Nemo's mom in the opening scene. In Bambi, they kill his mother. In The Lion King, Simba's dad gets killed off. Aladdin is an orphan, Jasmine has no mom. In the Fox and the Hound, Tod's mother is killed by hunters. Cinderella lives with her evil stepmother. Pocahontas has no mother, while Dumbo has no father. Toy Story's Andy also has no father. Penny from The Rescuers is an orphan. And poor Snow White is not only an orphan, but the wicked Queen tries to kill her, too.I guess Disney just can't think of a way for children to come of age with both parents actively involved in their children's lives. Judging from Disney movies, Parents don't raise children. Instead, Parents only get in the way. Iron Will gets Will's dad out of the way early on. This plot device gains people's sympathy, and gives us reason to root for Will (Dad was going to for me, now I've got to do it for him!).And I wonder how this movie would have been received if it was closer to the actual historical event, where the heroic American LOST, and the winner was an Indian (who was the target if discrimination). I also wonder why they had to be so obvious with the nick/name: Iron Will Stoneman, and who actually had the iron will, the boy or the dog.Facts aside, I still think Iron Will is a fairly good movie, and would have enjoyed it more if only the music didn't get really loud every few minutes.
