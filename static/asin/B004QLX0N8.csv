1424662,A2582KMXLK2P06,B004QLX0N8,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Seconds Apart is one of those movies where the writing just isn't strong enough to make it a memorable film overall, however it does have a few really appealing qualities going for it.  For one the acting on the part of the twin brothers is excellent.  They're not quite as twisted and evil as I was expecting (which would have probably been a clich&eacute; by this point if they *had* been twisted and evil) but instead they're more like clever, often times likeable and normal teens with a darker edge to their personality.  Do not underestimate this subtle darker edge however- secretly these twins are capable of doing unthinkable things.The parents are also rather awesome, especially the mother who comes off so innocent, caring and normal only to suddenly do or say something totally unexpected.  I'm thinking of a hilarious line she says after she discovers Orlando Jones punched her son.  And yeah, the detective played by Orlando Jones is amazing in his role in trying to figure out how people die under mysterious conditions whenever the twins are around.  The twins have the power to possess people into killing themselves.Now here's where the problem lies- the story usually isn't particularly scary.  This is due to the twins not being very sinister when the moment calls for it, so the deaths that occur (a woman slicing her throat with a piece of glass and the most laughable one of all, a priests' leg arteries bursting as he screams and dies while pulling a worm out of his leg) are all very weak scares/deaths.  In fact the only shocking death is the game of Russian roulette played in the beginning where these teens can be seen blowing their brains out with a revolver.  Now THAT is a very shocking segment!Plus, despite Orlando Jones being a great believable actor, it never seems like there's ever enough suspense in the way he goes about his detective duties in cracking the case of the evil twins being responsible for the deaths.  Everything feels like it's bordering on making a mockery of the whole ""evil twin"" concept.  That's the impression I got at least.  It's obviously not a coincidence that so many people die whenever the twins are around, but more could have been done to make the story more interesting.  In fact maybe I'm crazy but the tone of the film overall reminds me of the Twilight Saga series (minus a couple really strong deaths of course).  I couldn't shake the Twilight Saga similarities in the way Seconds Apart's fantasy elements are presented and the style of characters which both make me instantly draw similarities to Twilight Saga.  Maybe I'm alone with that feeling.Also, often times the story jumps around awkwardly confusing the viewer in the process.  A dream Orlando Jones had earlier in the movie is an example.  I couldn't figure out what was going on for a couple minutes here.  Expect this type of awkwardness to pursue throughout the movie in small doses, but at least it's never overwhelming or a mess of confusion.  The story usually gets back on track.  Unfortunately if you add up all the little temporary confusing moments, it gets annoying over the course of the movie.Overall not one of the better horror movies out there but for 85 minutes of entertainment you could do a lot worse.  That's Seconds Apart.",3,seconds apart for these twins,1404432000,"07 4, 2014",2014,3279,"['Seconds', 'Apart', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'writing', 'just', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'make', 'memorable', 'film', 'overall', 'however', 'have', 'few', 'really', 'appealing', 'qualities', 'going', 'one', 'acting', 'part', 'twin', 'brothers', 'excellent', ""'re"", 'not', 'quite', 'twisted', 'evil', 'was', 'expecting', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'been', 'clich', 'eacute', 'point', '*had*', 'been', 'twisted', 'evil', 'instead', ""'re"", 'more', 'like', 'clever', 'often', 'likeable', 'normal', 'teens', 'darker', 'edge', 'personality', 'Do', 'not', 'underestimate', 'subtle', 'darker', 'edge', 'however-', 'secretly', 'twins', 'are', 'capable', 'doing', 'unthinkable', 'things.The', 'parents', 'are', 'also', 'rather', 'awesome', 'especially', 'mother', 'who', 'off', 'so', 'innocent', 'caring', 'normal', 'only', 'suddenly', 'do', 'say', 'something', 'totally', 'unexpected', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'hilarious', 'line', 'Orlando', 'Jones', 'punched', 'son', 'yeah', 'detective', 'played', 'Orlando', 'Jones', 'amazing', 'role', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'people', 'die', 'mysterious', 'conditions', 'whenever', 'twins', 'are', 'around', 'twins', 'have', 'power', 'possess', 'people', 'killing', 'themselves.Now', 'here', 'where', 'problem', 'lies-', 'story', 'usually', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'scary', 'due', 'twins', 'not', 'being', 'very', 'sinister', 'when', 'moment', 'deaths', 'occur', 'woman', 'slicing', 'throat', 'piece', 'glass', 'most', 'laughable', 'one', 'priests', 'leg', 'arteries', 'bursting', 'dies', 'pulling', 'worm', 'leg', 'are', 'very', 'weak', 'scares/deaths', 'fact', 'only', 'shocking', 'death', 'game', 'Russian', 'roulette', 'played', 'beginning', 'where', 'teens', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'blowing', 'brains', 'out', 'revolver', 'Now', 'THAT', 'very', 'shocking', 'segment', 'Orlando', 'Jones', 'being', 'great', 'believable', 'actor', 'never', 'ever', 'enough', 'suspense', 'way', 'detective', 'duties', 'cracking', 'case', 'evil', 'twins', 'being', 'responsible', 'deaths', 'Everything', 'feels', 'bordering', 'making', 'mockery', 'whole', 'evil', 'twin', 'concept', 'impression', 'got', 'least', 'obviously', 'not', 'coincidence', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'die', 'twins', 'are', 'around', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'interesting', 'fact', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'crazy', 'tone', 'film', 'overall', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'series', 'couple', 'really', 'strong', 'deaths', 'course', 'could', ""n't"", 'shake', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'similarities', 'way', 'Seconds', 'Apart', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'are', 'presented', 'style', 'characters', 'make', 'instantly', 'draw', 'similarities', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'alone', 'feeling.Also', 'often', 'story', 'around', 'awkwardly', 'confusing', 'viewer', 'process', 'dream', 'Orlando', 'Jones', 'had', 'earlier', 'movie', 'example', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'couple', 'minutes', 'here', 'Expect', 'type', 'awkwardness', 'pursue', 'movie', 'small', 'doses', 'least', 'never', 'overwhelming', 'mess', 'confusion', 'story', 'usually', 'back', 'track', 'Unfortunately', 'add', 'up', 'little', 'temporary', 'confusing', 'moments', 'annoying', 'course', 'movie.Overall', 'not', 'one', 'better', 'horror', 'movies', 'there', '85', 'minutes', 'entertainment', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'Seconds', 'Apart']",Seconds Apart: After Dark Originals

But if you want a movie that makes you stop and think a little, and one that boasts some good acting performances, this might be right up your alley. The Entin twins are spectacularly creepy in their roles as sinister forces of evil with telekinetic powers, and Orlando Jones is brilliant as the detective trying to solve the puzzle that the two twins leave behind. There are a few spots toward the middle of the film where it kind of drags on, but the ending makes it worthwhile to keep watching. The clashing forces that occur when one of the twins becomes distracted by a beautiful young woman is really fun to watch, and Jones is very convincing as he wrestles not only with seemingly unstoppable forces throughout, but also a few demons of his own.Usually the After Dark films don't have a plot this deep or contain performances this good, so if you are looking for a little change of pace, this is certainly a film that might interest you.

Seconds Apart deals with the twins Seth (Gary Entin - Rest Stop: Don't Look Back) and Jonah (Edmond Entin - Rest Stop: Don't Look Back), and the games they play using their twin power. Unfortunately for them, their plans are disrupted by two events. First is the persistent Detective Lampkin (Orlando Jones - The Replacements), who has a story of his own, and the demons to go with it. Second is the appearance of new student Eve (Samantha Droke - The Secret Life of the American Teenager), who has unknowingly driven a wedge between Seth and Jonah.The twins in Seconds Apart draw attention to themselves when one of their experiments results in the mysterious suicides of several football players. While investigating their deaths, Detective Lampkin gets the feeling that the twins are involved, and that somehow they use a power associated with twins. Seth and Jonah's twin power is their ability to manipulate people's senses, what they are experiencing. Things were fine as long as they just creeped their fellow classmates out, but when people started dying, their antics couldn't be ignored any further. But not only do they have Detective Lampkin breathing down their necks, but Eve has shown up and is creating an irreparable rift between the brothers. But only when their lives fall into complete disarray, do we see the extent of their powers.The side plot in Seconds Apart appears to have little to do with the movie, but Detective Lampkin's story and disfigurement give the twins a way to toy with him, and feeds into the end of the movie. But let's face it, its twins, and the Entin boys can be creepy.

1424675,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004QLX0N8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","How much do I love ""Seconds Apart?"" Much more than I could ever anticipate. But I must offer a qualifier. As a pair of creepy and aloof twins, Gary and Edmund Entin are absolutely riveting. The brothers, bonded by a twisted energy, have a need for unorthodox experimentation in order to connect with humanity. Every moment that the Entins are center stage in the movie, I couldn't take my eyes away. Yes, we've all seen the mysteriously odd twin bit before--especially utilized in horror conventions--but everything about their performances seemed fresh and exciting. And as their fierce co-dependency and unhealthy obsessions become more clear within the film's plot, they never strike an inauthentic note. However, and unfortunately, the screenplay doesn't utilize its most valuable asset effectively and splits the primary narrative between them and the investigator obsessed with their violent shenanigans (Orlando Jones). And it's a noticeable miscalculation--every time the film detours away from the Entins, their absence is greatly noticed.The movie comes out of the gate shooting. At a local high school party, a friendly game between the star athletes ends up turning into a nightmarish spectacle. The resultant carnage looks self-contained by the evidence, but something just doesn't sit well with our intrepid investigator played by Jones. Jones is also haunted by violence and is, perhaps, more attuned to the dark nature of the act. As a witness comes forward to say that she saw the twins at the party with a video camera, it piques Jones' interest. For their part, the boys seem to be living in an insular world consisting only of one another and their supremely odd parents. When they are together, they are conducting ruthless and paranormal experiments to see if they are capable of normal human emotions. When the more sensitive twin meets a young lady, it threatens to destroy the precariously intimate bond the brothers have forged. As the brothers start to feel the pulls of independence, Jones moves closer and all will be revealed in a dramatic showdown that will forever change everyone's existence.As I mentioned, the heart of the film (the Entin twins) is surprisingly strong, effective, and genuinely creepy. The brotherly interactions are smart and scary. Jones does, through no fault of his own, weigh the film down. I simply couldn't muster much sympathy for his back story and plight as it slowed the film's momentum. Also, when the final confrontations start occurring, much of the reveal is quite satisfying. But the timing and convenience of it all undermines the crispness of the rest of the picture. And things just seem to come to a conclusion, it doesn't always feel organic or natural. I don't know, ultimately, that the pay-off is as worthy as the set-up--and it's all a bit open-ended for my taste as well. 5 stars for the Entin brothers, but only about 3 1/2 stars overall. I'll round up as I loved the guys and their brand of psychological horror.

Schultz,"[2, 2]","This film has all the ingredients of a really good psychological thriller: good acting, the evocative atmosphere of moss-covered Louisiana trees, a cleanly enucleated color palette, and the always fascinating premise of sinister twins. But it doesn't mix these ingredients quite right. It ends up with something that's a little too much of a hodgepodge and not enough of a proper three course meal.I had hoped that the Director and the Entin twins would fill in some of the gaps by voicing their own interpretations in the DVD Commentary. But no, in the Commentary, the three mostly chat about the technical and interpersonal aspects of making the movie, rather than offering any insights into the movie's themes. So the viewer is left with a lot of unanswered questions.What exactly is the twins' ""program?""What are they attempting to ""feel?"" Is it their victims' terror? However, that can't quite be right, because some of their victims act robotically, without any gratifying emotional awareness.What is the meaning of the twist ending? You might think you grasp it, but then when you start to unravel the logic of it, you find it could be explained in several different ways, or else it defies explanation.But the most nagging question of all - why is the Detective smoking Marvel cigarettes, a brand that was popular during WWII, but that was discontinued in the 60's?Still, this is an engrossing, treacherous double feature of a film with some brilliant visual metaphors for the eerie synchronicity of the twins - such as the two pieces of bread popping out of the toaster.",4,"Atmospheric, Inventive, but Leaves Too Many Questions Unanswered",1308787200,"06 23, 2011",2011,1579,"['film', 'ingredients', 'really', 'good', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'good', 'acting', 'evocative', 'atmosphere', 'moss-covered', 'Louisiana', 'trees', 'cleanly', 'enucleated', 'color', 'palette', 'always', 'fascinating', 'premise', 'sinister', 'twins', ""n't"", 'mix', 'ingredients', 'quite', 'right', 'up', 'something', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'hodgepodge', 'not', 'enough', 'proper', 'three', 'course', 'meal.I', 'had', 'hoped', 'Director', 'Entin', 'twins', 'would', 'fill', 'gaps', 'voicing', 'own', 'interpretations', 'DVD', 'Commentary', 'Commentary', 'three', 'mostly', 'technical', 'interpersonal', 'aspects', 'making', 'movie', 'rather', 'offering', 'insights', 'movie', 'themes', 'viewer', 'left', 'lot', 'unanswered', 'exactly', 'twins', 'program', 'What', 'are', 'attempting', 'feel', 'victims', 'terror', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'be', 'right', 'victims', 'act', 'robotically', 'gratifying', 'emotional', 'awareness.What', 'meaning', 'twist', 'ending', 'might', 'think', 'grasp', 'then', 'when', 'start', 'unravel', 'logic', 'find', 'could', 'be', 'explained', 'several', 'different', 'ways', 'else', 'most', 'nagging', 'question', 'why', 'Detective', 'smoking', 'Marvel', 'brand', 'was', 'popular', 'WWII', 'was', 'discontinued', '60', 'Still', 'engrossing', 'treacherous', 'double', 'feature', 'film', 'brilliant', 'visual', 'metaphors', 'eerie', 'synchronicity', 'twins', 'such', 'two', 'pieces', 'bread', 'popping', 'toaster']",Seconds Apart: After Dark Originals
1424680,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B004QLX0N8,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[2, 3]","This is a film in the horror genre. It takes, as its subject, twin brothers Seth and Jonah, who have the ability of telekinesis or as it is sometimes referred `psychokinesis' . This is the ability to control physical matter by the exertion of brain power, put simply they can make stuff happen.The film opens with a house party where some of the jocks are upstairs playing Russian Roulette, the only object of the game being to absolutely positively kill everyone. The twins are recording the whole thing on video camera, and then the titles roll. Yep it gets to the blood splats before the credits have finished.The twins played eerily and brilliantly by brothers Edmund and Gary Entin, do everything alike. They dress act, talk and even sleep together (in the same bed that is). They let us know from the start that they are working on a project, that involves getting a certain feeling - hence the repeated question, `can you feel it?'.The cops are soon involved and the main investigator is Orlando Jones (Evolution etc). He knows they have something to do with it, but can not find any evidence. What does become obvious is that they are at their most dangerous when they are together. Then a new girl turns up and hits it off with one of the brothers. That is when the older (by a few seconds) starts to realise his ordered world is under threat.Orlando Jones tells his story by flash backs and we realise he has more than his share of demons too.This is a well crafted, acted and directed (Antonio Negret) teen horror. It is more psychological than blood and gore. It is only 91 minutes long and is well paced for all of it, and comes across as being quite believable. It has the obligatory twists, but it will keep you guessing.
