Actually the best acting performance in the film was by Ash Adams - and I did not realize he was the director until the movie credits came up at the end. Two of my favorite actors ever, Ed Harris [""Jacknife""] and Amy Madigan [""Twice in a Lifetime"" and ""In the Name of the People""] - were wasted in their roles, I feel. However, I don't think there were good roles for them in this film, and they weren't afforded meaty enough material to make their performances memorable.The prison scenes were not believable. What maximum security prison do you know of where you are able to visit an inmate right in his own cell? When the dad [Ed Harris] and the son [Brian Presley] were arguing at the top of their lungs like they were going to fight there was not a corrections officer in sight. The entire movie looked to be thrown together. I realize it was low-budget and there were problems with the production, but the consumer is not required to take any of that into consideration. All we know is that we want to see a great movie. When I saw Ed Harris' name on the DVD cover I just wanted to check it out. ""Once Fallen"" is not a movie I will watch again.",2,I wanted to like it ...,1334188800,"04 12, 2012",2012,1248,"['why', 'bought', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'half', 'way', 'was', 'just', 'waiting', 'end', 'Actually', 'best', 'acting', 'performance', 'film', 'was', 'Ash', 'Adams', 'did', 'not', 'realize', 'was', 'director', 'movie', 'credits', 'came', 'up', 'end', 'Two', 'favorite', 'actors', 'ever', 'Ed', 'Harris', '[', 'Jacknife', ']', 'Amy', 'Madigan', '[', 'Twice', 'Lifetime', 'Name', 'People', ']', 'were', 'wasted', 'roles', 'feel', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'were', 'good', 'roles', 'film', 'were', ""n't"", 'afforded', 'meaty', 'enough', 'material', 'make', 'performances', 'memorable.The', 'prison', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'believable', 'What', 'maximum', 'security', 'prison', 'do', 'know', 'where', 'are', 'able', 'visit', 'inmate', 'right', 'own', 'cell', 'When', 'dad', '[', 'Ed', 'Harris', ']', 'son', '[', 'Brian', 'Presley', ']', 'were', 'arguing', 'top', 'lungs', 'were', 'going', 'fight', 'there', 'was', 'not', 'corrections', 'officer', 'sight', 'entire', 'movie', 'looked', 'be', 'thrown', 'together', 'realize', 'was', 'low-budget', 'were', 'problems', 'production', 'consumer', 'not', 'required', 'take', 'consideration', 'know', 'want', 'see', 'great', 'movie', 'When', 'saw', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'name', 'DVD', 'cover', 'just', 'wanted', 'check', 'out', 'Once', 'Fallen', 'not', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'again']",N/A
1369615,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003WM5WL0,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","Ash Adams, wrote, directed, produced and acted in this very raw story of a family challenged by a life of crime in San Pedro, California.  While the film has some brittle edges, editing flaws that disturb the flow of the story, the acting is so fine that these flaws become minor.  It is a small budget film populated with some of the finest actors in the business and the result makes for a film that deserves more attention than it received in the theater.Chance (Brian Presley, in a career changing role) has been released from five years in prison for a crime in which he took the blame for a number of his friends and family.  Upon release he discovers that his ex-girlfriend Kat (Alison Eastwood) gave birth to their son August while Chance was in jail. Kat promptly walks out on Chance and August, leaving Chance to parent a child he didn't even know he fathered.  Chance's friend Beat (Chad Lindberg) is a damaged man, having witnessed with Chance the brutal slaughter of a man by Chance's father Liam (Ed Harris), a man who has been in prison since and has become the leader of the Aryan Brotherhood.  Beat has a debt that must be paid and pleads with Chance to do one more Cocaine sale for dirty cop Rath (Ash Adams) to free himself from that debt and get on with life.  Chance wants to turn his life around, tries to pay off Beat's debt by participating in a knuckle fight for the operator Eddie (Peter Weller), but when he loses the fight all bets are off.  Chance visits his blind aunt Rose (Amy Madigan) and her friend Sue (Sharon Gless) and Rose insists Chance visit his father Liam in the jail.  Chance also becomes attached to a friend of Kat's named Pearl (Taraji P. Henson) and Pearl helps Chance to find fatherhood with August and a relationship with her.  From all of these setups come encounters that alter the story with realistic views of the corruption of San Pedro as well as a coming together of Chance and his father  whose turbulent family history is revealed at the end of the film.The cast is excellent: Ed Harris, Amy Madigan, Taraji P. Henson, Peter Weller, Ash Adams, Chad Lindberg and especially Brian Presley give high quality performances as do the supporting cast members.  This little film may be tough and raw, but the underlying importance of family is strong and well worth attention from a wider audience.

This is one of those compelling human dramas that draws viewers in with its difficult subject matter, and credible performances by a talented ensemble cast. Though Ed Harris is in this movie, and delivers a powerful performance, Brian Presley delivers a visceral performance as Chance, an ex-con who wishes to get away from a life of crime.The story begins with a young Chance and his best friend Beat by the beach in San Pedro. Ed Harris plays Chance's father Liam, and when Liam sees Beat's bruised and battered face, he storms Beat's house in a fit of rage. His violence results in Beat's father's death and Liam is sentenced to life in prison. Fast forward years later - Chance has just been released after serving five years in prison. His only wish is to lead a clean life, yet his past stalks him unrelentingly. Beat, his childhood friend (Chad Lindberg in a memorable performance) is a tortured and damaged soul who can't seem to escape his own traumatic past. Chance feels a sense of loyalty to Beat, and this loyalty prevents him from just walking away when he is asked to make good on Beat's debts to a mobster and also a crooked cop, Rath (Ash Adams who also wrote and directed this film). Meanwhile, Chance makes a startling discovery - he is the father of a five-year-old boy August by his ex-girlfriend Kat. When Kat leaves to pursue her own interests, Chance is left at a loss. In steps Pearl (Taraji P. Henson) who helps Chance find his footing.With all this drama unfurling, there's still the parallel story of Chance's father, Liam who has since moved up the prison ranks to become the leader of the Aryan Brotherhood. A quiet and contemplative man, Liam's sole wish is to see his son safe, and he risks everything to ensure Chance gets a second go at leading a normal life. The stories are actually quite well-woven together, but viewers who are looking for a fast-paced, shoot-em'-up action flick will be sorely disappointed. Instead, viewers get treated to a leisurely-paced yet intense human drama that explores the various facets of human relationships - of what drives them, and how one man tries to steer the right path even though the odds are stacked against him. In this, the movie succeeds very well, and instead of being a purely Ed Harris vehicle, the movie shows off a talented ensemble cast (that also includes Peter Weller as a mobster). Final verdict -a thought-provoking drama with credible character development.",5,Compelling and gritty drama,1294185600,"01 5, 2011",2011,2598,"['Honestly', 'had', 'not', 'popped', 'up', 'instant', 'play', 'list', 'Netflix', 'husband', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'one', 'compelling', 'human', 'dramas', 'viewers', 'difficult', 'subject', 'matter', 'credible', 'performances', 'talented', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'movie', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Brian', 'Presley', 'visceral', 'performance', 'Chance', 'ex-con', 'who', 'get', 'away', 'life', 'crime.The', 'story', 'young', 'Chance', 'best', 'friend', 'Beat', 'beach', 'San', 'Pedro', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Chance', 'father', 'Liam', 'when', 'Liam', 'Beat', 'bruised', 'battered', 'face', 'Beat', 'house', 'fit', 'rage', 'violence', 'results', 'Beat', 'father', 'death', 'Liam', 'sentenced', 'life', 'prison', 'Fast', 'forward', 'years', 'later', 'Chance', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'serving', 'five', 'years', 'prison', 'only', 'wish', 'lead', 'clean', 'life', 'past', 'stalks', 'unrelentingly', 'Beat', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Chad', 'Lindberg', 'memorable', 'performance', 'tortured', 'damaged', 'soul', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'escape', 'own', 'traumatic', 'past', 'Chance', 'sense', 'loyalty', 'Beat', 'loyalty', 'just', 'walking', 'away', 'when', 'asked', 'make', 'good', 'Beat', 'debts', 'mobster', 'also', 'crooked', 'cop', 'Rath', 'Ash', 'Adams', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'Meanwhile', 'Chance', 'startling', 'discovery', 'father', 'five-year-old', 'boy', 'August', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Kat', 'When', 'Kat', 'pursue', 'own', 'interests', 'Chance', 'left', 'loss', 'steps', 'Pearl', 'Taraji', 'P.', 'Henson', 'who', 'Chance', 'find', 'footing.With', 'drama', 'unfurling', 'still', 'parallel', 'story', 'Chance', 'father', 'Liam', 'who', 'moved', 'up', 'prison', 'become', 'leader', 'Aryan', 'Brotherhood', 'A', 'quiet', 'contemplative', 'man', 'Liam', 'sole', 'wish', 'see', 'son', 'safe', 'everything', 'ensure', 'Chance', 'second', 'go', 'leading', 'normal', 'life', 'stories', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'well-woven', 'together', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'fast-paced', ""shoot-em'-up"", 'action', 'flick', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'Instead', 'viewers', 'get', 'treated', 'leisurely-paced', 'yet', 'intense', 'human', 'drama', 'various', 'facets', 'human', 'relationships', 'what', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'steer', 'right', 'path', 'even', 'odds', 'are', 'stacked', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'instead', 'being', 'purely', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'vehicle', 'movie', 'off', 'talented', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'also', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'mobster', 'Final', 'verdict', '-a', 'thought-provoking', 'drama', 'credible', 'character', 'development']",N/A
