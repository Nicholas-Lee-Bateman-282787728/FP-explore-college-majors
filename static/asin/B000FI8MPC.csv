990229,AD84ZN1ZQBSSH,B000FI8MPC,Angie,"[3, 3]","What a great DVD this is to have in your collection! ""The Ellen Show"" is fun, smart, sincere, sweet and often downright hysterical. Back in 2006 I bought this, but somehow didn't open it until recently and boy, am I glad I did...it helped me get through a bad cold...it was the perfect medicine!!Sometimes all you need to see is that ""I know something you don't"" twinkle in Ellen's eyes and you just start to laugh. The woman has talent, there's no doubt about that and it can be seen in almost every episode found on two discs.Some of the best ones include the pilot where Ellen returns to her hometown after her dot com business goes bust and finds a quirky bunch of people, both in her family and her co-workers. These folks have no concept there's a whole world to be found outside the small town of Clark. It's this mindset, of course, that helps fuel the humor of the show.Other terrific titles on the first disc include: ""Walden Pond"" (Ellen becomes Clark's high school guidance counselor and bonds with a troubled student)...""Vanity Fair"" (contains a cute mix-up involving beauty salons and animal hairstylists...gives new meaning to ""best in show"")...""Missing the Bus"" (I'm a bit biased here since I love Betty White, but still it's a super episode AND with a young Dakota Fanning who steals your heart as a young Ellen in flashback).A strong supporting cast carries ""The Ellen Show"" far above the bad treatment it received from its own network (how a tv program like this got cancelled when ""Yes, Dear"" went on to have four seasons is beyond me!)The lovable, if terribly misguided set of co-workers are played to comedic charm by the ever-reliable Martin Mull (""Mr Munn""), the surprisingly gifted Kerri Kenney (as ""Pam"" the awkward, but ultimately kind home ec teacher), the adorable Jim Gaffigan (who is more than suited for the role of teacher-of-all-trades ""Rusty"") and the much-loved Cloris Leachman (who is just wonderful and endearingly daff as Ellen's mom.)The second disc is not to be missed either. ""Ellen's First Christmas"" offers us the delightful Mary Tyler Moore (just as much an influence on Ellen DeGeneres as Lucille Ball, I imagine)...""Just the Duck"" captures the dilemmas singles face living in a small town and serves up some very bright moments of humor when Ellen attempts to dine alone at a fancy restaurant and finds plenty of patronizing pity on her plate...""Shallow Gal"" speaks to all of us who weren't quite right with in the ""in"" crowd back in high school and secretly want a second chance (guest star Maureen McCormick couldn't have been better cast...I mean, it's ""Marcia"" we're talking about)...""Where the Sun Doesn't Shine""  gives us a strong Cloris Leachman performance and proof that she has never lost her timing or her shine when it comes to delivering a great line.My only disappointment here is that there are no extras (can you imagine the interviews they could have done?) and that there isn't more to love. ""The Ellen Show"" is a reminder that we need to save the sitcom before it dies for good.",5,It even has a catchy theme song...,1189641600,"09 13, 2007",2007,3044,"['What', 'great', 'DVD', 'have', 'collection', 'Ellen', 'Show', 'fun', 'smart', 'sincere', 'sweet', 'often', 'downright', 'hysterical', 'Back', '2006', 'bought', 'somehow', 'did', ""n't"", 'open', 'recently', 'boy', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'helped', 'get', 'bad', 'cold', 'was', 'perfect', 'medicine', 'Sometimes', 'need', 'see', 'know', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'twinkle', 'Ellen', 'eyes', 'just', 'start', 'laugh', 'woman', 'talent', 'doubt', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'almost', 'episode', 'found', 'two', 'discs.Some', 'best', 'ones', 'include', 'pilot', 'where', 'Ellen', 'hometown', 'dot', 'com', 'business', 'bust', 'quirky', 'bunch', 'people', 'family', 'co-workers', 'folks', 'have', 'concept', 'whole', 'world', 'be', 'found', 'small', 'town', 'Clark', 'mindset', 'course', 'fuel', 'humor', 'show.Other', 'terrific', 'titles', 'first', 'disc', 'include', 'Walden', 'Pond', 'Ellen', 'Clark', 'high', 'school', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'bonds', 'troubled', 'student', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'cute', 'mix-up', 'involving', 'beauty', 'salons', 'animal', 'hairstylists', 'new', 'meaning', 'best', 'show', 'Missing', 'Bus', ""'m"", 'bit', 'biased', 'here', 'love', 'Betty', 'White', 'still', 'super', 'episode', 'AND', 'young', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'who', 'heart', 'young', 'Ellen', 'flashback', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Ellen', 'Show', 'far', 'bad', 'treatment', 'received', 'own', 'network', 'how', 'tv', 'program', 'got', 'cancelled', 'when', 'Yes', 'Dear', 'went', 'have', 'four', 'seasons', 'lovable', 'terribly', 'misguided', 'set', 'co-workers', 'are', 'played', 'comedic', 'charm', 'ever-reliable', 'Martin', 'Mull', 'Mr', 'Munn', 'surprisingly', 'gifted', 'Kerri', 'Kenney', 'Pam', 'awkward', 'ultimately', 'kind', 'home', 'ec', 'teacher', 'adorable', 'Jim', 'Gaffigan', 'who', 'more', 'suited', 'role', 'teacher-of-all-trades', 'Rusty', 'much-loved', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'who', 'just', 'wonderful', 'endearingly', 'daff', 'Ellen', 'mom', 'second', 'disc', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'either', 'Ellen', 'First', 'Christmas', 'delightful', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'influence', 'Ellen', 'DeGeneres', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'imagine', 'Duck', 'dilemmas', 'face', 'living', 'small', 'town', 'up', 'very', 'bright', 'moments', 'humor', 'when', 'Ellen', 'dine', 'alone', 'fancy', 'restaurant', 'plenty', 'patronizing', 'pity', 'plate', 'Shallow', 'Gal', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right', 'crowd', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'secretly', 'want', 'second', 'chance', 'guest', 'star', 'Maureen', 'McCormick', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'cast', 'mean', 'Marcia', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Where', 'Sun', 'Does', ""n't"", 'Shine', 'strong', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'performance', 'proof', 'never', 'lost', 'timing', 'shine', 'when', 'delivering', 'great', 'line.My', 'only', 'disappointment', 'here', 'are', 'extras', 'can', 'imagine', 'interviews', 'could', 'have', 'done', ""n't"", 'more', 'love', 'Ellen', 'Show', 'reminder', 'need', 'save', 'sitcom', 'good']",The Ellen Show - The Complete Series

990232,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000FI8MPC,Byron Kolln,"[3, 3]","Here's another show (along with ""Bette"" and ""What About Joan"") which I'm still surprised didn't have a longer shelf-life.  THE ELLEN SHOW was Ellen DeGeneres' followup to her ""Ellen"" sitcom (which folded in 1998 after it's fifth season when DeGeneres controversially came out both on the show and in real life).  DeGeneres wisely avoided the trap which brought the axe down on her previous show, and established her character in THE ELLEN SHOW as gay right from the start, thereby getting the issue out of the way to focus on the stories at hand--of which very few focus on the character's sexuality.In THE ELLEN SHOW, DeGeneres plays Ellen Richmond, a dot.com company owner who files for Chapter 11, and is forced to move back to her hometown of Clark.  There, she finds her mother Dot (Cloris Leachman), crazier than ever, has kept her room exactly as she left it--anticipating the very day that Ellen would return home in precisely these circumstances!  Ellen's man-crazy younger sister Catherine (Emily Rutherford) works at the pharmacy/coffee shop, and her former highschool boyfriend Rusty Carnouk (Jim Gaffigan) has a job at the...erm, highschool.With nothing else to fall back on, Ellen applies for the position of guidance counsellor at her old highschool.  A true fish-out-of-water, Ellen tries sharing and applying her ""big city"" life experiences with her new colleagues, only for everything to always end in disaster!Due to poor ratings, THE ELLEN SHOW was canned after only one season.  Watching the series again on DVD I'm struck by how strong and terribly sharp the writing was.  It's a fantastic series!  Cloris Leachman is hilarious as Ellen's mother--and Ms Leachman has been extremely discerning in recent years about the TV shows she commits herself to on a permanent basis--so it must have been good enough for her to sign the dotted line.  Emily Rutherford (whom many would recognise as one of Jack's main acting students in ""Will & Grace"") is wonderfully goofy as Catherine.  Martin Mull co-stars as highschool principal Mr. Munn--a role not too dissimilar from the one he filled in ""Sabrina the Teenage Witch"".COMPLETE EPISODE LISTING:""Pilot""- Ellen Richmond, a successful dot.com owner, returns in triumph to her hometown of Clark for the very first Ellen Day celebrations, until a phonecall turns her whole life around...""Walden Pond"" - Wondering how to spend the rest of her life - or the life she must lead in Clark - Ellen decides to mull over her options by sitting next to a calm river...""Chain Reaction"" - Ellen goes on the campaign trail when P.J.

990235,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B000FI8MPC,Mark Turner,"[0, 1]","I always thought Ellen DeGeneres was hilarious when I first saw her stand up routine on HBO years ago. Parts of it I can recall to this day. When she decided to take on television with a series we watched and enjoyed that as well. And then she redefined what she wanted to do with that series. Rather than be funny it became about her being a lesbian. That was important the first episode she did it on but it soon wore thin when each week we were having her tell someone else about it. It suddenly was more agenda oriented and less funny. It wasn't long after that the show folded too much controversy. The fact is the ratings weren't there.Then in 2001 Ellen came back with a new series on a new network with a new story. Sure she was a lesbian again, but it wasn't the focus of the show. It didn't matter. What mattered was being funny and yes, she was funny again. Unfortunately the series didn't bring back the viewers she had lost and it only lasted one season. But for fans you can watch it now on DVD at an affordable price from Mill Creek, just $9.98 (amazon.com price).Here she plays Ellen Richmond, back home in the small town she grew up in which is throwing a celebration in her honor as the most successful person to have left there. Ellen has owned several businesses and has one of the biggest dot.com businesses going. Until it collapses and she goes bankrupt...just as she is about to attend the dinner in her honor for being successful.From their the series has her visiting with her friends and returning home to start her life again. She lives with her eccentric mother (Cloris Leachman) and ditzy sister Catherine (Emily Rutherford), a woman who seems intent of picking the worst possible candidates for boyfriends. The man who brought her home for the celebration is her old school teacher Mr. Munn (Martin Mull), now the principal of the school. Her ex-prom date Rusty (Jim Gaffigan) still thinks he might have a chance of winning her hand, even though she's informed him of her sexual preference.Even though things look bad, Ellen lands on her feet. Mr. Munn offers her a counseling position at the school and she ends up having people to talk and give advice to. This is where Ellen's talent lies, in the back and forth conversations she has with people. It feels like it stems from her stand up routines in spots and is actually pretty funny. And while one running joke about being a lesbian keeps popping up (the ladies gym teacher might be the only other lesbian in town), it never becomes the focus of the series. Sure she mentions it now and then but each time the story continues from there rather than dwell on the topic.I have no idea why the series didn't do better. Perhaps it was the competition it was up against. Maybe people were afraid it would be exactly the same as her previous show. In any event it was funny and perhaps better than a number of comedies we see on the air right now. But it didn't last long and for fans the only way to remember it is by picking up this DVD set now. Fans did eventually come to accept Ellen for herself and stop judging her. Her talk show first aired in 2003 and continues successfully to this day and she hosted the most recent Oscars. Ellen was and is a funny comedienne.

Hummel ""mh1957""","[17, 19]","I like this show a bit more than Ellen's earlier hit show (where she famously came out); Cloris Leachman is very funny, sort of an abrupt version of Carol Brady, if you will.  Her sister is also very, very good, Jim Gaffigan is not bad, and Martin Mull is essentially reprising the character he played on Roseanne.Ellen is very subtle at times, but I think that's funnier than what you find in most ""joke"" oriented sitcoms.  Lots of good observational humor, and Ellen DeGeneres is very likeable throughout.  This is one that the audience never caught up with.The Editorial Review dismisses the show because it didn't do well in the ratings, as if there's never been a wonderful show that didn't do well in the ratings!  CBS buried this show on Friday nights, and preempted it more than once, so it never had a chance.  The ""standup comedian with his/her own show"" window was closing--hardly Ellen DeGeneres' fault.  This is a smart show, and Carol Leifer who worked on ""Seinfeld"" and had her own show (Alright Already) is co-creator, so you know it's going to have quality writing.  That's the key.I'm a comedy connoisseur, and believe me this is a smart comedy--along the lines of Dick Van Dyke, Mary Tyler Moore, The Bob Newhart Show, Barney Miller, Cheers, early Seinfeld, etc.  Check it out.",5,Really Funny and Truly Witty,1156464000,"08 25, 2006",2006,1296,"['like', 'show', 'bit', 'more', 'Ellen', 'earlier', 'hit', 'show', 'where', 'famously', 'came', 'out', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'very', 'funny', 'sort', 'abrupt', 'version', 'Carol', 'Brady', 'will', 'sister', 'also', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'Jim', 'Gaffigan', 'not', 'bad', 'Martin', 'Mull', 'essentially', 'reprising', 'character', 'played', 'Roseanne.Ellen', 'very', 'subtle', 'times', 'think', 'funnier', 'what', 'find', 'most', 'joke', 'oriented', 'sitcoms', 'Lots', 'good', 'observational', 'humor', 'Ellen', 'DeGeneres', 'very', 'likeable', 'one', 'audience', 'never', 'caught', 'up', 'with.The', 'Editorial', 'Review', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'ratings', 'never', 'been', 'wonderful', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'ratings', 'CBS', 'buried', 'show', 'Friday', 'nights', 'preempted', 'more', 'once', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'standup', 'comedian', 'his/her', 'own', 'show', 'window', 'was', 'closing', 'hardly', 'Ellen', 'DeGeneres', 'fault', 'smart', 'show', 'Carol', 'Leifer', 'who', 'worked', 'Seinfeld', 'had', 'own', 'show', 'Alright', 'Already', 'co-creator', 'know', 'going', 'have', 'quality', 'writing', 'key.I', ""'m"", 'comedy', 'connoisseur', 'believe', 'smart', 'comedy', 'lines', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Show', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'Cheers', 'early', 'Seinfeld', 'etc', 'Check', 'out']",The Ellen Show - The Complete Series

I remember first seeing her on a show where she portrayed a secretary, but I can't remember the name of that show.  From that time, I have always enjoyed her stand-up, talk-show, and hugely successful and historical program, ""Ellen.""  I've read her books and even have a signed copy of Finding Nemo.  That being said, I had NEVER heard of this program, ""The Ellen Show.""  I was skeptical, especially after reading some reviews, but felt confident when I read that the standard Ellen comedy found its way into this show.  I'm glad I made the decision to buy - it's funny (a bit corny and predictable at times, but cute, warm, and fuzzy) - filled with a star-studded cast and several notable guest appearances (including Mary Tyler Moore!).  Although not as funny as ""Ellen,"" this show is entertaining, not a disappointment, and has a nostalgic 'early 2000's' feel.",4,A surprising find!,1327968000,"01 31, 2012",2012,921,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'Ellen', 'was', 'kid', 'literally', 'remember', 'first', 'seeing', 'show', 'where', 'portrayed', 'secretary', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'name', 'show', 'time', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'stand-up', 'talk-show', 'hugely', 'successful', 'historical', 'program', 'Ellen', ""'ve"", 'read', 'books', 'even', 'have', 'signed', 'copy', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'being', 'said', 'had', 'NEVER', 'heard', 'program', 'Ellen', 'Show', 'was', 'skeptical', 'especially', 'reading', 'reviews', 'felt', 'confident', 'when', 'read', 'standard', 'Ellen', 'comedy', 'found', 'way', 'show', ""'m"", 'glad', 'made', 'decision', 'buy', 'funny', 'bit', 'corny', 'predictable', 'times', 'cute', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'filled', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'several', 'notable', 'guest', 'appearances', 'including', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'Ellen', 'show', 'entertaining', 'not', 'disappointment', 'nostalgic', ""'early"", '2000', 'feel']",The Ellen Show - The Complete Series
990238,A3W3OG4JJKFFTV,B000FI8MPC,RetroRhythms,"[27, 28]","I didn't see this series when it was originally aired ... and I am so thankful for the DVD release! The premise is that Ellen is an ex-dotcom exec whose corporation has gone belly-up. She decides to move back to her hometown, the dot-on-the-map ""Clark,"" where she is in for a real culture shock, as she adjusts to life as a guidance counselor at her old high school, as well as living with her mom and younger sister -- who cannot begin to comprehend some of the big-city ways Ellen has picked up in L.A.The great thing about Ellen is that in every series or show in which she appears, there's a familiar feeling that always brings joy. You don't get the feeling that she's trying to be hip, or play up a role more than necessary. There's always that, for lack of a better term, ""Ellen element"" that is predictable in the most surprising ways.The show's heart comes from the hilarious ignorance of the small-town characters (marvelously portrayed by the likes of Kerri Kenney, Jim Gaffigan, and others) and Ellen's attempts to interact effectively with them. Though the first two episodes are a bit slow, the plotlines get funnier and better-paced after that. There are some hysterical moments. For instance, in the episode ""Vanity Hair,"" Pam (Kenney) cuts Ellen's hair, as does a dog groomer -- unbeknownst to Ellen. The dialogue in the process, as well as the results, will leave you out of control!Also worth definite mention are Cloris Leachman in her role as Ellen's mom, and Emily Rutherford as Ellen's younger sister. They play their roles in a way that is not generically stereotyped, rather, zesty and unique.I recommend this DVD set to any Ellen fans, as well as any who appreciate down-to-earth situation comedy!",4,An Overlooked Gem!,1152921600,"07 15, 2006",2006,1723,"['did', ""n't"", 'see', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'aired', 'am', 'so', 'thankful', 'DVD', 'release', 'premise', 'Ellen', 'ex-dotcom', 'exec', 'corporation', 'gone', 'belly-up', 'move', 'back', 'hometown', 'dot-on-the-map', 'Clark', 'where', 'real', 'culture', 'shock', 'life', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'as', 'well', 'living', 'mom', 'younger', 'sister', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'begin', 'comprehend', 'big-city', 'ways', 'Ellen', 'picked', 'up', 'L.A.The', 'great', 'thing', 'Ellen', 'series', 'show', 'familiar', 'feeling', 'always', 'joy', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'feeling', 'trying', 'be', 'hip', 'play', 'up', 'role', 'more', 'necessary', 'always', 'that', 'lack', 'better', 'term', 'Ellen', 'element', 'predictable', 'most', 'surprising', 'ways.The', 'show', 'heart', 'hilarious', 'ignorance', 'small-town', 'characters', 'marvelously', 'portrayed', 'likes', 'Kerri', 'Kenney', 'Jim', 'Gaffigan', 'others', 'Ellen', 'attempts', 'interact', 'effectively', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'bit', 'slow', 'plotlines', 'get', 'funnier', 'better-paced', 'are', 'hysterical', 'moments', 'instance', 'episode', 'Vanity', 'Hair', 'Pam', 'Kenney', 'Ellen', 'hair', 'dog', 'groomer', 'unbeknownst', 'Ellen', 'dialogue', 'process', 'as', 'well', 'results', 'will', 'leave', 'control', 'Also', 'worth', 'definite', 'mention', 'are', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'role', 'Ellen', 'mom', 'Emily', 'Rutherford', 'Ellen', 'younger', 'sister', 'play', 'roles', 'way', 'not', 'generically', 'stereotyped', 'rather', 'zesty', 'unique.I', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'set', 'Ellen', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'appreciate', 'down-to-earth', 'situation', 'comedy']",The Ellen Show - The Complete Series
