Matter of fact, my writing is based on my dreams, specifically a 4 year period of dreaming that ranged from high school into college. Dreams have always been shrouded in mystery. Some believe they are premonitions, of things to come, others claim they are spirits talking to us, still others believe that is is gibberish that the brain cycles through when at rest.I have to say, I was not disappointed by this documentary. There were some great ideas and studies that were presented in the area of dreaming. The fact is, no matter what people think about dreams, they have inspired a number of ideas and inventions (and in my case, novels). If you have any interest in dreams, take a look at this, you will be happy that you did.",5,Very Interesting Explanation of Dreams,1273795200,"05 14, 2010",2010,843,"['When', 'heard', 'program', 'was', 'extremely', 'excited', 'have', 'been', 'fascinated', 'dreams', 'was', 'child', 'Matter', 'fact', 'writing', 'based', 'dreams', 'specifically', '4', 'year', 'period', 'dreaming', 'ranged', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'Dreams', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'shrouded', 'mystery', 'believe', 'are', 'premonitions', 'things', 'come', 'others', 'claim', 'are', 'spirits', 'talking', 'still', 'others', 'believe', 'gibberish', 'brain', 'cycles', 'when', 'rest.I', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'documentary', 'were', 'great', 'ideas', 'studies', 'were', 'presented', 'area', 'dreaming', 'fact', 'matter', 'what', 'people', 'think', 'dreams', 'have', 'inspired', 'number', 'ideas', 'inventions', 'case', 'novels', 'have', 'interest', 'dreams', 'take', 'look', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'did']",N/A

This documentary is a good 'state of the art' on the study of dreams.Here's the scoop. This documentary features a handful of talking heads that deal in dreams. It runs through their various methods of retrieving the data and the results they feel they've achieved. Those results are pretty cool.Through their studies they seem to have agreed on the various stages of sleep and their accompanying dream states. There are REM and non-REM dreams and the two seem to be different. They find that other animals (dogs, cats, rats) dream pretty much the way we do. Some also surmise that even our ancient ancestors dreamed the same way we do. Their details might pertain to their immediate day to day, but the 'purpose' and outlines are the same. One researcher was even able to ""code"" dreams from some huge number of people and was able to tell the differences, by percentage, on what people dream about. How dreams differ between men and women, and even what might happen to a given individual in the future. This is some fascinating stuff.The format isn't much different than anything you've seen in a documentary before, and some of staged dream sequences are a bit cheesy, but overall this is very valuable for someone who wants to know the subject. They didn't get into any of the fringe stuff (like when a person dreams of some money winning numbers) or when people direct their dreams (lucid dreams) but there is still a lot of food for thought.

1298088,A1U6XPYATU9OPG,B002XNEIIM,G. Denick,"[0, 0]","As per the usual, PBS does an excellent job of covering the subject at hand in this episode of Nova. Measuring at only 50 minutes in length (making it easy to consume in some downtime), this documentary manages to squeeze an enormous amount of theories, experiments, and research data into its presentation. The interviews with the sleep/dream specialists are fascinating, and though they agree on some subjects within their field, it's clear from their opposing perspectives that much work remains to be done, when it comes to the study of sleep.We all have a basic comprehension of the dream process, but this show opened my eyes to many aspects that I was not aware of. For instance, dreaming does NOT take place only during REM cycles- it also takes places during the non-REM cycles. However, the types of dreams that occur are radically different, and the results of the studies blew my mind. Ever wonder why some mornings you bounce right out of bed and have a great day, but on others, you feel dead tired and down? This show will explain why.Also of great interest is the research that indicates that dreaming is not simply a psychological process, but a physiological one, as well. Perhaps most significant of all, however, is that a Harvard PhD teaches you how to condition your mind so that you can dream about what YOU want to dream about.
