695193,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B000063JDI,Andres C. Salama,"[1, 1]","This comic book like biopic about singer Jerry Lee Lewis (Dennis Quaid) rise to fame and subsequent fall from grace after his marriage with his 13 years old cousin Myra (a very young and very good Winona Ryder) was discovered, is probably not terribly true to life, but it is still very entertaining. Quaid happily hams it up in an over the top performance that has to do more with caricature than with acting. Alec Baldwin adds to the fun in his cameo as Jerry Lee's cousin, preacher Jimmy Swaggart. There is a nifty, idealized pop reconstruction of small town America in the 1950s. And the music, of course, is great. Best scene: staid English journalists raising a scandal when the singer and his teen wife arrive.",4,Fun and over the top biopic about Jerry Lee Lewis,1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,717,"['comic', 'book', 'biopic', 'singer', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'rise', 'fame', 'subsequent', 'fall', 'grace', 'marriage', '13', 'years', 'old', 'cousin', 'Myra', 'very', 'young', 'very', 'good', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'was', 'discovered', 'probably', 'not', 'terribly', 'true', 'life', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Quaid', 'happily', 'up', 'top', 'performance', 'do', 'more', 'caricature', 'acting', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'fun', 'cameo', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'cousin', 'Jimmy', 'Swaggart', 'nifty', 'idealized', 'pop', 'reconstruction', 'small', 'town', 'America', '1950s', 'music', 'course', 'great', 'Best', 'scene', 'staid', 'English', 'journalists', 'raising', 'scandal', 'when', 'singer', 'teen', 'wife', 'arrive']",N/A

Jerry Lee Lewis, who for some reason cooperated with the making of this silly film, is portrayed by Dennis Quaid as a country bumpkin and a clown. The movie portrays his wife Mona and his family as ignorant idiots. The whole tone of the film is incredibly insulting. Not surprisingly, Lewis later turned against the film. I'm amazed he didn't read the script first. It does have one redeeming quality, though. The music, which was all newly recorded for the film by Jerry Lee when he was cooperative, is excellent. There's a music video of ""Great Balls of Fire"" that isn't on the DVD but on YouTube that is superb.

I thought I'd watch a few minutes and get back to my typing, but NO! Jerry Lee grabbed me and wouldn't let go...just as he did back in the day.Like one of the reviewer's grandmothers, I used to dance around the house to Jerry Lee's rock 'n roll, especially the unforgettable, lively ""Great Balls of Fire."" He was a riot then and he's a riot now!I love, love, love this movie...because it's lively, fun and makes me feel good! I did feel sad for Jerry Lee and his teen bride. Even though she was young, they loved each other and my heart broke to see them misunderstood and his music banned because of his marrying her at such a young age (thirteen). The English treated them disgracefully, and I don't blame him for not apologizing...at great cost to his career.To view the way Jerry Lee and Myra defied everyone and stuck together through thick and thin was tender, moving and rather sweet. Bittersweet moments! And even though this rock 'n roll legend was a rebel and a bit cocky, you couldn't help but love the guy...Dennis Quaid was riotous in the role of Jerry Lee, and Winona Ryder was perfect as the very cute, adorable teen. They were both lovable (and naive in many ways). I thought I'd die laughing when she took her doll house with her as she moved from her father's home to live with her new husband. (And wait till you see Alec Baldwin carrying on as a stereotypical Baptist preacher; even though his role was rather laughable, he did a great job of acting...lol)Kudos to this cast and the producers for a few hours of almost nonstop laughter, dished up with the bittersweet romance.I won't forget this film for a long time. Even though certain parts were left out of ""The Killer's"" life, this movie managed to give the main details and give us a good concept of his life and lots of great rock 'n roll.It's heartening to know he's still performing and as popular as in his heyday.

It just didn't gel too much as I felt as though there was too much embelishing on certain points of the movie to where the second half of the movie seemed to rush through too fast, and with too many photographs. The Jerry Lee Lewis story is a interesting one indeed since I found out he is related to Jimmy Swaggart. I often wondered how Jerry Lee reacted when Jimmy fell in 1988? I often look around at bumper stickers at cars that say If God Doesn't Exist Then Act As Though He Doesn't, and I often wonder for those who feel Christians are judgemental if a Christian falls down what is thier reaction. I admit when both Bakker and Swaggart fell I was harsh with them, and I guess I felt it was my right because it gave me creedence to the way I lived my lifestyle. Do all others feel the same way? I felt that there was also too much explaining of the inspiration of doing the song ""Whole Lot Of Shakin Goin On"". That is my favorite Lewis song, and then they take it to a honky tonk in Tennessee, and the women were drunk, and these were the more mature looking women, and that was a turn off for me as I just can't handle drunk people.

695201,A2RWGW6TGUX7E5,B000063JDI,"Gary Covington ""Southern Rocker""","[3, 3]","This is a great movie about the young, defiant Jerry Lee (A.K.A. ""The Killer"").Its a story about him growing up down in Ferriday, Louisiana, (my home state) along with his cousin the Rev.Jimmy Swaggart. I'm been to the house Jerry Lee grew up in. Its a museam now, operated by one of his sisters. When Jerry Lee was a kid, he would sneek over to the black juke joints, and listen to their music. He loved it. During this movie, from childhool on up, Jerry Lee and his cousin the Rev.Jimmy Swaggart were always in conflict. Rev. Swaggart believed Rock & Roll was the Devil's Music, and he thought that Jerry Lee was a sinner for playing it. Anyway, Jerry Lee ""stuck to his guns"", and kept performing Rock & Roll music.Jerry Lee wanted to become a star like Elvis, so he set his sights on Memphis, and Sam Phillips with Sun Records. He moved to Memphis, got a record deal with Sam Phillips and Sun Records. He moved in with relatives in Memphis, I believe it was his first cousin and his wife and their 13 year old daughter Myra. Anyway, this ""1st cousin"" was the bass player in Jerry Lee's band. Jerry and Myra got close, and even though Jerry Lee had already been married twice. He got a Marriage Licence and secrely married his 2nd cousin Myra at age 13. When her dad found out, he got really mad and started to try and kill Jerry Lee, but Sam Phillips talked him out of it. He gradually accepted it, and remained a bass player in Jerry Lee's band. Jerry Lee's marriage to Myra lasted 13 years. He's been married at least 6 times and I think this was the longed marriage, he ever had.One really good part of the Movie, is a concert with Chuck Berry. The people in charge told Jerry Lee, he had to start the concert and Chuck would follow him. This made Jerry Lee mad. He said ""nobody follows the Killer"". Anyway, he agreed and when he was performing his last sone ""Great Balls of Fire"", he poured lighter fluid on the piano and set it on fire, as he played the song. The Audience went WILD. After that, when Jerry Lee was leaving the stage, he told Chuck Berry ""Follow that""!!!Anyway, Sam Phillips scheduled an English Tour for Jerry Lee, and against the advise of Sam Phillips, Jerry Lee took along his 13 year old bride Myra. Anyway, when the press found out about his marriage to his cousin a 13 year old, they turned against him. At his first concert the crowd just sit there and showed no emotion. This made Jerry Lee so mad, that he pushed the piano off the stage. Anyway, all his shows were cancelled in England, and he was ordered out of the Country. His last words for England - ""England can Kiss My A**"".Jerry Lee made a come-back, with an appearance on the Steve Allen show. He and Myra had a son Steve Allen Lewis (who later drowned) and a daughter who is still living.Anyway, it ends with Jerry Lee being at the Rev. Swaggard's church, where the Rev. was peaching directly to Jerry Lee, and about him playing ""the Devil's Music"". Jerry Lee gets up and says ""Well If I'm going to Hell, I'm going there playing the piano"". He and Myra leave the church. The movie soon ends.I grew up in this type of environment, and now I can say, thankfully attitudes about Rock & Roll have changed down here in Louisiana, and the ""Bible Belt"". Rock & Roll is now not necessarily regarded as the devil's music. It is generally accepted by everyone down here. Also, now Jerry Lee and his cousin the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart are not in conflict with one another. Jerry Lee usually performs some gospel songs in his concerts.

695202,A20ITI6SAIKPK4,B000063JDI,Hoosier Hayseed,"[3, 3]","I do love this movie, if only because I have always loved Jerry Lee Lewis, and think that he is so incredibly hokey as to be fantastically, uniquely great.I mean, his ""Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On"" has been one of the very greatest rock and roll anthems ever.And he is without peer as a country artist.  Nobody has ever sung a more significant country song than ""Another Time, Another Place,"" or ""She Still Comes Around To Love What's Left Of Me.""But what I can't understand is why Dennis Quaid played him to be as squirrely as he comes across.Because if Jerry Lee had any say-so as to how he was portrayed, I just can't see him giving the OK to what came out on film.I could see arrogant, or supremely self-assured, or cock-sure, or brash, or even pushy, but not strangely almost effeminate, as Dennis Quaid has portrayed him.Jerry Lee was and is supremely talented, but I can't believe that he ever had a single day where he acted as off-the-wall as Dennis Quaid made him out to be.And the fact that he married his 13 year-old 2nd cousin, I think she was, was not even that far-fetched, given the time and place.But anyway, the movie is terrific, just seeing the history of how Jerry Lee was exposed to the kind of music that formed his background.  Also, seeing the cars that were commonplace in the fifties, such as the Olds 98s and the Cadillac El Dorados makes it a fun movie to watch.Oh, for those good old days, when we really did drive those cars, and listen to and dance to that music.",5,Was He Really Like That?,1320883200,"11 10, 2011",2011,1494,"['do', 'love', 'movie', 'only', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'think', 'so', 'incredibly', 'hokey', 'be', 'fantastically', 'uniquely', 'great.I', 'mean', 'Whole', 'Lotta', 'Shakin', 'Goin', 'been', 'one', 'very', 'greatest', 'rock', 'roll', 'anthems', 'peer', 'country', 'artist', 'Nobody', 'ever', 'sung', 'more', 'significant', 'country', 'song', 'Time', 'Place', 'Still', 'Love', 'What', 'Left', 'Me', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'played', 'be', 'as', 'squirrely', 'across.Because', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'had', 'say-so', 'how', 'was', 'portrayed', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'giving', 'OK', 'what', 'came', 'out', 'film.I', 'could', 'see', 'arrogant', 'supremely', 'self-assured', 'cock-sure', 'brash', 'even', 'pushy', 'not', 'strangely', 'almost', 'effeminate', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'portrayed', 'him.Jerry', 'Lee', 'was', 'supremely', 'talented', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ever', 'had', 'single', 'day', 'where', 'acted', 'as', 'off-the-wall', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'made', 'out', 'be.And', 'fact', 'married', '13', 'year-old', '2nd', 'cousin', 'think', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'far-fetched', 'given', 'time', 'place.But', 'anyway', 'movie', 'terrific', 'just', 'seeing', 'history', 'how', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'was', 'exposed', 'kind', 'music', 'formed', 'background', 'Also', 'seeing', 'cars', 'were', 'commonplace', 'fifties', 'such', 'Olds', '98s', 'Cadillac', 'El', 'Dorados', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch.Oh', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'when', 'really', 'did', 'drive', 'cars', 'listen', 'dance', 'music']",N/A

I caught the beginning of the movie the other day and I had to turn it off. The movie is a slapstick comedy. I'm sure Jerry Lee Lewis made a fool of himself many times over in his life. I'm sure the man has made a lot of questionable decisions and committed offensive acts along the way. This movie, however, does not take the man serious at any time. Right out of the gates Jerry Lee Lewis is treated as if he was some sort of cartoon character. I'd like to watch a movie about JLL which treats the man, the artist, with some DIGNITY and RESPECT. Yes, we all know JLL married his cousin. And even one of the Baldwin brothers, is it Adam, is in the movie. He is a preacher, and I think Jerry's cousin. He too is a foolish stereotype, a cartoon character. Having stated this I like Dennis Quaid's work as an actor but not when it insults and parades foolishness across the movie screen. We all should have a movie made about our worst and most foolish qualities and behaviors. No, really we shouldn't but that's what was done to Jerry Lee Lewis.
