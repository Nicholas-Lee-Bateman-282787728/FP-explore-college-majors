I remember listening to Dave Matthews bootleg cassette tapes in 1988 in our college dorms, being told, ""This guy in Virginia is really good.  We gotta go check him out sometime!""  Many of his followers have no idea that he's been pumping out great live shows for that long.  This Central Park show is a perfect example of what he has to offer - which is pure bliss for a jam band fan.  This show has the old saxophone player (who is killer in this show and every other show he ever played) and it also contains the one and only Mr. Warren MothaF*k*ng Haynes!!!  The hardest working guitarist in the world today.  He really shines on Cortez the Killer, as even Dave is even caught on camera looking back at the drummer, saying, ""He's f*king good"".  I highly recommend this show, as the sound is full and crisp from beginning to end and the video doesn't flip around too much like many other shows.",5,great concert,1334275200,"04 13, 2012",2012,1008,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'everyone', 'else', ""n't"", 'already', 'said', 'Dave', 'awesome', 'LIVE', 'show', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'remember', 'listening', 'Dave', 'Matthews', 'bootleg', 'cassette', 'tapes', '1988', 'college', 'dorms', 'being', 'told', 'guy', 'Virginia', 'really', 'good', 'got', 'ta', 'go', 'check', 'out', 'sometime', 'Many', 'followers', 'have', 'idea', 'been', 'pumping', 'out', 'great', 'live', 'shows', 'long', 'Central', 'Park', 'show', 'perfect', 'example', 'what', 'offer', 'pure', 'bliss', 'jam', 'band', 'fan', 'show', 'old', 'saxophone', 'player', 'who', 'killer', 'show', 'other', 'show', 'ever', 'played', 'also', 'one', 'only', 'Mr.', 'Warren', 'MothaF*k*ng', 'Haynes', 'hardest', 'working', 'guitarist', 'world', 'today', 'really', 'Cortez', 'Killer', 'even', 'Dave', 'even', 'caught', 'camera', 'looking', 'back', 'drummer', 'saying', 'f*king', 'good', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show', 'sound', 'full', 'crisp', 'beginning', 'end', 'video', ""n't"", 'flip', 'around', 'too', 'much', 'many', 'other', 'shows']",Dave Matthews Band - The Central Park Concert

Maybe I dont know yet, but comparing the DMB with him is indeed a reccomendation. I like good jazz/rock music played as good live as in the studio. I'll give it 3 stars and update when I've seen it+++++++++++Well old Agy's right again. The first DVD didnt fully work. Had to replace it. But I listened to half the first disc and all the second disc. This is one stonking great live band. Never heard much of the DMB before but I'm going to from now on. This group really know how to play tight rock/jazz. The violin/sax/bass/acoustic mix really works well and is breath of fresh air compared to some of todays groups. On the second disc cortez the killer is the highlight which is hard to pick because its all so good.The lead guitar player, a chubby chappy, really knows how to play that track and almost equals NY's studio effort.

Very few get the honor of playing in the middle of a baseball diamond in the United States' largest and most famous park. Weather you like DMB or not, you will love this concert and very swiftly place it on your proudest shelf of your concert DVD collection. The production, the direction, the sound, and the extras are simply the best i've seen.  And to see DMB play a Neil Young cover (Cortez the Killer) with one of the greatest guitarists, and most decorated song writers in the world (Warren Haynes; Allman Brothers Band and Gov't Mule) is a landmark event in rock history that one would be sorry to have missed.

784217,A200C7YQJ45LRR,B0000UQQTE,"Anthony Rupert ""shut up, Shut Up, SHUT UP!!!""","[5, 10]","I think this concert performance was done primarily to cease the rumors that, no, DMB are NOT breaking up (some people began to wonder because of Some Devil). Also, a great thing about DMB is that if you hear a song on one of their albums that you DON'T like (like about half of the material on Busted Stuff), somehow it doesn't matter when you hear it live because then it just sounds too damn good.Of course the band performs plenty of great songs like ""Don't Drink The Water"", ""Too Much"" and, uh-hmmm, ""Ants Marching"". But they also do some lesser-known songs like ""Help Myself"" from the Scream 2 soundtrack. They even perform covers, like Neil Young's ""Cortez The Killer"". And although I would give them an ""A"" for effort for ""All Along The Watchtower"", I'm not sure I'd go as far as to say it's right up there with the original - after all, Dylan and Hendrix have pretty big shoes to fill.All in all, DMB performs extremely well at this Central Park concert, and you can tell the audience is really feeling it. The band even looks like they're having fun while they're playing, which I think is important. Some people may be upset that ALL their favorites weren't played that night (no ""Space Between""???), but it was a great show regardless. It's so energetic that it almost makes you feel like you're AT it.My suggestion is to pick up the DVD instead of the CD.

I'd heard some of the bands stuff and I'd seen them once from about a mile away at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Fest but I'd never gone out of my way to get more information.On the advise of a friend I picked up this DVD and was impressed. The band rocked for the better part of three hours and while I was not real familiar with the set list looking at the copyright dates I presume I got music from throughout the career.The highlights included  a version of &quot;Two Step&quot; to end the first disc and  and incredible &quot;Cortez the Killer&quot; and &quot;Jimi Thing&quot; that Warren Haynes sat in on.All in all a great performance that made me want to go out and buy some of the other cd's.,3,Excellent show,1073347200,"01 6, 2004",2004,785,"['Let', 'preface', 'review', 'saying', ""'m"", 'not', 'real', 'big', 'Dave', 'Matthews', 'fan', ""'d"", 'heard', 'bands', 'stuff', ""'d"", 'seen', 'once', 'mile', 'away', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Jazz', 'Heritage', 'Fest', ""'d"", 'never', 'gone', 'way', 'get', 'more', 'information.On', 'advise', 'friend', 'picked', 'up', 'DVD', 'was', 'impressed', 'band', 'rocked', 'better', 'part', 'three', 'hours', 'was', 'not', 'real', 'familiar', 'set', 'list', 'looking', 'copyright', 'dates', 'presume', 'got', 'music', 'career.The', 'highlights', 'included', 'version', 'quot', 'Two', 'Step', 'quot', 'end', 'first', 'disc', 'incredible', 'quot', 'Cortez', 'Killer', 'quot', 'quot', 'Jimi', 'Thing', 'quot', 'Warren', 'Haynes', 'sat', 'on.All', 'great', 'performance', 'made', 'want', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'other', 'cd']",Dave Matthews Band - The Central Park Concert

If I think something is crap then I will say so. This DVD is as near PERFECT as you can get. I know one could wish for certain extras such as subtitled lyrics or multi angles but this is only dressing.I live in the UK, and as such DMB are not as well known as in the USA. When telling friends and spreading the DMB gospel I'm asked who they are. I always retort...... 'They produce music for GROWN-UPS.'Just want to add that I thought 'Two Step' on 'Listener Supported' was tremendous, and it still is, but so is the arrangement of 'Two Step' on this Central Park DVD.

Before, I knew they had the stuff to become legends...but now I know they already are.  I own every CD and DVD they have released to date.  I was worried when I read that they were going to release the CD &amp; DVD of the Central Park Concert, specially after the last DVD disappointed a little in terms of having been in full screen format with so many cuts that you could not really appreciate the band.  Besides, the performance offered nothing new other than presenting new material live.  But no so with this release.  I was so blown away by the band on this concert that I think its safe to say that these guys, at least in my book, now rank among the likes of Led Zeppelin, Rush, etc.  There is no new band nowadays that can touch them in terms of musicianship and virtuosity.  Their unique sound, their creativity...the arrangements of old classics.  Many bands sound good, but these guys are on a class of their own.  This has to be one of the best concert DVD's to date...and believe me, I own a few.  The performance is so outstanding that there are no words to really describe it.  I gave a bad review to their last DVD, but if I could give this one 1,000 stars I would.  Its just a shame that is not receiving the amount of acceptance as it truly deserves (in terms of sales I mean), but people will soon catch up.  The guy that convinced the band to film and release this concert in HD widescreen anamorphic video should be canonized.  The video is absolutely flawless doing justice to a legendary performance.  The sound is fantastic nonetheless.  If you own their other concert DVD's, you have to get this one.  It's THE one, and almost impossible to top.

The band was on fire- the setlist was just one great song after another and the jams were incredible.  Warren Hayes made it even better, especailly during that ridiculus ""Jimi Thing"" in which Dave morphs the song into Buffalo Springfeild!!  The bass solo> ""Watchtower"" was spectacular and the triple encore was unbelievable.  I had no idea where it was going to end: ""Ants"" looked like the show would end, and then I figured that they had to leave it at ""Jimi Thing"", but after three more songs I knew it was over and started to walk away.  However, the band came back and did three more songs, ending with a spectacular ""Stay.""  It was an epic event and the largest gathering of people I've ever seen.
