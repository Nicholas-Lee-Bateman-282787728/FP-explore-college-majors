349343,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6302989590,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[17, 17]","One of the best books I have ever read is Margaret Landon's true story of Anna Leonowens, who at the age of 33, went to Siam as a governess to tutor the king's children. A widow of incredible courage and talent, her story is moving as well adventurous, and this film is a marvelous adaptation of Anna's time in that strange and foreign land, with her small son to take care of.Landon's book of course also inspired the terrific Rodgers and Hammerstein musical and the film starring Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner, as well as the far less successful 1999 remake.Rex Harrison, in his first film for an American studio is riveting as King Mongkut; it's a sensitive and insightful portrayal, with his beautiful voice and enunciation making the most of the intelligent script, and Irene Dunne is a strong and wonderful Anna. These were the days when Caucasian actors took the parts of Asians, and we have some excellent supporting parts taken by Lee J. Cobb as Prime Minister Kralahome, Linda Darnell as Tuptim, and Gale Sondergaard, who received a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination as Lady Thiang.Oscars were given for Best Art Direction, and to Leon Shamroy for his fabulous cinematography, and nominations were for score (Bernard Herrmann) and screenplay.The excellence and charisma of its two stars and their chemistry together are great to watch, and anyone who likes Landon's book as much as I do will appreciate this film. Total running time is 128 minutes.",5,a wonderful film based on a great book,1087084800,"06 13, 2004",2004,1464,"['One', 'best', 'books', 'have', 'ever', 'read', 'Margaret', 'Landon', 'true', 'story', 'Anna', 'Leonowens', 'who', 'age', '33', 'went', 'Siam', 'governess', 'tutor', 'king', 'children', 'widow', 'incredible', 'courage', 'talent', 'story', 'moving', 'as', 'well', 'adventurous', 'film', 'marvelous', 'adaptation', 'Anna', 'time', 'strange', 'foreign', 'land', 'small', 'son', 'take', 'care', 'book', 'course', 'also', 'inspired', 'terrific', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'musical', 'film', 'starring', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'as', 'well', 'far', 'less', 'successful', '1999', 'remake.Rex', 'Harrison', 'first', 'film', 'American', 'studio', 'riveting', 'King', 'Mongkut', 'sensitive', 'insightful', 'portrayal', 'beautiful', 'voice', 'enunciation', 'making', 'most', 'intelligent', 'script', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'strong', 'wonderful', 'Anna', 'were', 'days', 'when', 'Caucasian', 'actors', 'took', 'parts', 'Asians', 'have', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'parts', 'taken', 'Lee', 'J.', 'Cobb', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Kralahome', 'Linda', 'Darnell', 'Tuptim', 'Gale', 'Sondergaard', 'who', 'received', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Lady', 'Thiang.Oscars', 'were', 'given', 'Best', 'Art', 'Direction', 'Leon', 'Shamroy', 'fabulous', 'cinematography', 'nominations', 'were', 'score', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'screenplay.The', 'excellence', 'charisma', 'two', 'stars', 'chemistry', 'together', 'are', 'great', 'watch', 'anyone', 'who', 'Landon', 'book', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'will', 'appreciate', 'film', 'Total', 'running', 'time', '128', 'minutes']",Anna & King of Siam VHS

Irene Dunne has always been a star with tons of class and in this movie you can see why she was so popular in the 30s and 40s. The movie differs from the musical stage hit The King and I, but it is, nevertheless, very enjoyable. The sets, the photography and Rex Harrison as the King are all superb.",4,Classy Movie with Claasy Actress,1083628800,"05 4, 2004",2004,361,"['Anna', 'King', 'Siam', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'always', 'been', 'star', 'tons', 'class', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'popular', '30s', '40s', 'movie', 'differs', 'musical', 'stage', 'hit', 'King', 'nevertheless', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'sets', 'photography', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'King', 'are', 'superb']",Anna & King of Siam VHS
349345,AQRNI6QDWMWHL,6302989590,Gehan Cooray,"[6, 6]","Everything about this film is outstanding...The acting, the music, the sets, the costumes, the storyline, the dialogue, the pace, and practically everything else you can think of. It may appear to 'drag' at points, but  don't let that stop you. I for one think this is a great deal better than  the recent version with Jodie Foster, because this focuses mainly on 'Anna'  and 'The King of Siam'.  To start with, Irene Dunne excels as Anna Leon  Owens. She is just as charming as Deborah Kerr, perhaps even better, very  emotional, very moving, and knows exactly how she should be in every scene.  She is probably the one who steals the entire show. Rex Harrison also does  surprisingly well as the strong-willed King of Siam, considering the fact  that he wasn't even Asian. He is probably even more 'emotional' than Yul  Brynner, especially in the scene of his death. Lee J. Cobb well-suited the  role of the headstrong Kralahome, and Gale Sondergarrd was very convincing  as Lady Thaing, the neglected first wife. And last but not least is Linda  Darnell, as Tuptim, the King's favourite concubine. She is nothing like the  sweet, innocent, kind-hearted and loving Tuptim we find in THE KING AND I  and ANNA AND THE KING(with Jodie Foster et. al). Infact, she turns out to  be proud, haughty and vain, and Linda Darnell expresses all these  'qualities' very well, yet she manages to be really sympathetic during a  trial, where she is not judged fairly.  However, this version is much more  emotional than the other two, with really sad, heartbreaking incidents, and  many may not be able to cope with it. It will probably stay in your head  for a very long time. For instance, two characters who survive in THE KING  AND I, which is the closest version to this, die here(One is even burned at  the stake, and her final cries of terror can be heard). But all in all,  this is one of the best out of the many versions of ANNA AND THE KING, and  THE KING AND I would never have been created, if it hadn't been for this...",4,I think it's much better than the recent version with Foster,960768000,"06 12, 2000",2000,2021,"['Everything', 'film', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'music', 'sets', 'costumes', 'storyline', 'dialogue', 'pace', 'practically', 'everything', 'else', 'can', 'think', 'may', 'appear', ""'drag"", 'points', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'one', 'think', 'great', 'deal', 'better', 'recent', 'version', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'mainly', ""'Anna"", ""'The"", 'King', 'Siam', 'start', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'excels', 'Anna', 'Leon', 'Owens', 'just', 'as', 'charming', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'perhaps', 'even', 'better', 'very', 'emotional', 'very', 'moving', 'exactly', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'scene', 'probably', 'one', 'who', 'entire', 'show', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'strong-willed', 'King', 'Siam', 'considering', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'Asian', 'probably', 'even', 'more', ""'emotional"", 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'especially', 'scene', 'death', 'Lee', 'J.', 'Cobb', 'well-suited', 'role', 'headstrong', 'Kralahome', 'Gale', 'Sondergarrd', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', 'Lady', 'Thaing', 'neglected', 'first', 'wife', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'Linda', 'Darnell', 'Tuptim', 'King', 'favourite', 'concubine', 'nothing', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'kind-hearted', 'loving', 'Tuptim', 'find', 'THE', 'KING', 'AND', 'ANNA', 'AND', 'THE', 'KING', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'et', 'al', 'Infact', 'out', 'be', 'proud', 'haughty', 'vain', 'Linda', 'Darnell', ""'qualities"", 'very', 'well', 'yet', 'be', 'really', 'sympathetic', 'trial', 'where', 'not', 'judged', 'fairly', 'However', 'version', 'much', 'more', 'emotional', 'other', 'two', 'really', 'sad', 'heartbreaking', 'incidents', 'many', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'cope', 'will', 'probably', 'stay', 'head', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'instance', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'survive', 'THE', 'KING', 'AND', 'closest', 'version', 'die', 'here', 'One', 'even', 'burned', 'stake', 'final', 'cries', 'terror', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'one', 'best', 'many', 'versions', 'ANNA', 'THE', 'KING', 'THE', 'KING', 'AND', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'had', ""n't"", 'been']",Anna & King of Siam VHS
349346,A1345VRK5MYG7,6302989590,James L.,"[7, 7]","Irene Dunne stars as a widowed single mother who is engaged to teach the numerous children of the King of Siam.  Rex Harrison stars as the King, a man trying to bring Siam into the modern world and to find respect for himself and his country on the world stage.  Ultimately, he comes to rely on Dunne for her support and guidance to achieve his goals, and there is an obvious feeling of attraction that develops between the two.  Dunne delivers yet another solid, emotional performance as the independent woman who must learn to adapt to a new culture.  Dunne was always such a pro, yet surprisingly is not as well known today as other actresses from her time.  Harrison strikes me as an odd choice for the role of the King, but he grew on me as the movie progressed, and although I think he's not the best choice, he nonetheless delivers a credible performance.  Gale Sondergaard, a favourite character actress of mine, is very good and quietly effective as the King's ignored first wife, looking out for the interests of her son, the heir.  I don't know how much of the story is really true, but it is entertaining and a good look at another time and place in history.  It's an excellent production, and even if you've seen the musical, I'm sure you'll enjoy this version, too.",4,The King and His Teacher,982972800,"02 24, 2001",2001,1279,"['Irene', 'Dunne', 'widowed', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'engaged', 'teach', 'numerous', 'children', 'King', 'Siam', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'King', 'man', 'trying', 'bring', 'Siam', 'modern', 'world', 'find', 'respect', 'country', 'world', 'stage', 'Ultimately', 'rely', 'Dunne', 'support', 'guidance', 'achieve', 'goals', 'obvious', 'feeling', 'attraction', 'two', 'Dunne', 'yet', 'solid', 'emotional', 'performance', 'independent', 'woman', 'who', 'must', 'learn', 'adapt', 'new', 'culture', 'Dunne', 'was', 'always', 'such', 'pro', 'yet', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'today', 'other', 'actresses', 'time', 'Harrison', 'odd', 'choice', 'role', 'King', 'grew', 'movie', 'progressed', 'think', 'not', 'best', 'choice', 'nonetheless', 'credible', 'performance', 'Gale', 'Sondergaard', 'favourite', 'character', 'actress', 'mine', 'very', 'good', 'quietly', 'effective', 'King', 'ignored', 'first', 'wife', 'looking', 'out', 'interests', 'son', 'heir', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'story', 'really', 'true', 'entertaining', 'good', 'look', 'time', 'place', 'history', 'excellent', 'production', 'even', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'musical', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'version', 'too']",Anna & King of Siam VHS

Rex Harrison made his movie debut and does an outstanding job playing the King of Siam, who although respects and adheres to ancient traditions, always has his eye towards the future of his country and people.Irene Dunne plays a teacher brought over from England to teach the Kings children (at least 50 children) the classics of literature, English, Math and History.  Though it starts at first her teaching the children, ultimately she becomes the student learning caring, compassion and genuine concern for the King, the children and the Siamese people she has learned to love.This is a wonderful movie and has a plot that will keep you interested from beginning to end.
