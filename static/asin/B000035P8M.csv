It was fantastic all throughout and complete box sets of the five seasons on DVD have been long overdue.  FOX has already put out complete seasons of X-Files and 24 on DVD.  Why not Ally McBeal?

Many episodes of Ally had the closing ten minutes or so set in the bar where Vonda Shepard and guests such as Barry White would belt out popular, and unfortunately, copyrighted music. This makes DVD sets of entire seasons a licensing nightmare. Since Ally was in production from 1997 until 2002, just prior and a little bit after the advent of TV on DVD, this probably did not figure into the calculation of Fox as to how this would turn into a legal quagmire that could not be overcome. The same problem probably exists for ""WKRP in Cincinnatti"" and ""Daria"".The clips are OK, but it just doesn't measure up to having entire episodes of this quirky unique series.

Although it is enjoyable and well written, watching it once is enough.  I had no idea that episodes were missing from this set but I found it plenty long enough as is. I am a lawyer so perhaps that is why I am not as enthusiastic as many others are about this series.  Let's just say this is fantasy romantic comedy based law as opposed to terribly real world law.  What really works in this series though is the well written human interest material about some very interesting characters in their 30s.  It is set in Boston.  Ally works in a firm owned by someone her own age.  The firm takes only high retainer cases of rich clients.  The actor who does the best job as a lawyer is Peter MacNicol as John &quot;the Biscuit&quot; Cage.  He is actually a very believable, existing &quot;type&quot; found in the real legal world. The premise that the set opens with is that Ally finds herself working for the same firm that has her old boyfriend on board.  Problem is that he is now married to someone else and she is still single.  Worse, he's married to another very attractive lawyer who also comes to work with the firm.  I got a little tired of this duo about half way through the series and found John &quot;the Biscuit&quot; Cage's scenes with Ally a lot more interesting.  Much is made of the unisex bathroom in the law firm which everyone in the firm uses together constantly.  I found this bizarre and thought it really took the show's credibility down a big notch.  However, I liked the computer generated special effects, especially the one of a fully dressed Ally swimming underwater through the law firm's offices.  The music is also very good.  If you are interested in romance genre material set amidst legal trappings, you will enjoy this set.",4,"Enjoyable, Good Entertainment for One Viewing",1035936000,"10 30, 2002",2002,1830,"['got', 'public', 'library', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'not', 'buy', 'enjoyable', 'well', 'written', 'watching', 'once', 'enough', 'had', 'idea', 'were', 'missing', 'set', 'found', 'plenty', 'long', 'enough', 'am', 'lawyer', 'so', 'perhaps', 'why', 'am', 'not', 'as', 'enthusiastic', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'series', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'fantasy', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'based', 'law', 'opposed', 'terribly', 'real', 'world', 'law', 'What', 'really', 'series', 'though', 'well', 'written', 'human', 'interest', 'material', 'very', 'interesting', 'characters', '30s', 'set', 'Boston', 'Ally', 'firm', 'owned', 'someone', 'own', 'age', 'firm', 'only', 'high', 'retainer', 'cases', 'rich', 'clients', 'actor', 'who', 'best', 'job', 'lawyer', 'Peter', 'MacNicol', 'John', 'quot', 'Biscuit', 'quot', 'Cage', 'actually', 'very', 'believable', 'existing', 'quot', 'quot', 'found', 'real', 'legal', 'world', 'premise', 'set', 'Ally', 'working', 'same', 'firm', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'board', 'Problem', 'now', 'married', 'someone', 'else', 'still', 'single', 'Worse', 'married', 'very', 'attractive', 'lawyer', 'who', 'also', 'work', 'firm', 'got', 'little', 'tired', 'duo', 'half', 'way', 'series', 'found', 'John', 'quot', 'Biscuit', 'quot', 'Cage', 'scenes', 'Ally', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'Much', 'made', 'unisex', 'bathroom', 'law', 'firm', 'everyone', 'firm', 'together', 'constantly', 'found', 'bizarre', 'thought', 'really', 'took', 'show', 'credibility', 'down', 'big', 'notch', 'However', 'liked', 'computer', 'generated', 'special', 'effects', 'especially', 'one', 'fully', 'dressed', 'Ally', 'swimming', 'underwater', 'law', 'firm', 'offices', 'music', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'interested', 'romance', 'genre', 'material', 'set', 'amidst', 'legal', 'trappings', 'will', 'enjoy', 'set']",N/A

Centering around perpetually single, slender and kooky Ally (Flockhart) the audience is brought in on her hallucinations (brilliantly realised via some impressive computer animation), her loves, her losses and her job at a law firm that seems to embrace the weird.  What made this show great was that it was so different, with David E. Kelley's sharp writing bringing in a mixture of well-placed observations on modern relationships and absolutely hilarious characters.  Who could forget John Cage (McNicol), the diminuative lawyer with a pet frog and a Barry White infatuation?  Add to this Richard Fish, who seems to wallow in his own male chauvanism, 'Subzero' Nelle (diRossi) and the deliciously nasty Ling (Liu) and you have a hot cast that's pretty much enjoyable whatever they're doing.Although recent episodes have been slammed for not being funny enough this might seem unfair, although there's always a tendancy to be nostalgic about the older episodes that are on offer here.

The series tanked in the ratings near the end of its run on Fox, but this is primarily due to the fact that Kelly had already departed, after the first two seasons, to write and produce ""The Practice"" on ABC, thus leaving ""Ally McBeal"" in less competant hands.If you don't know the premise behind the series by now, everything hinges on Ally, a waifish love-lorn lawyer who is dumped by her boyfriend Billy while the two were still in law school. Ally returns to Boston and finds employment with another alumni from her university days, Richard Fisk, who just happens to be starting up his own law firm where, no kidding!, Billy is already working.Sparks fly as Ally realizes that, not only is Billy married to another sexy young lawyer, Georgia, but she(Georgia) is coming to work at the same firm. All this happens in just the first hour long episode featured on this two disc DVD set.All in all, you get six episodes from this Emmy-winning Fox series.  Each episode illustrates why this is probably one show that we will be speaking of fondly in decades to come.Fox really ticks me off with this double disc! In their zeal to quickly release a DVD during the show's height in popularity, Fox not only does not give us an entire season of the show on DVD, but they have the guts to randomly picked out episodes from their chronological order. Since every episode pretty much hinges on the one before it, characters like Judge Whipper (Dyan Canon)just sort of randomly appear and then disappear from the plot lines without any explanation for the first time viewer.Although we get hints of Ally's neurotic behavior, the absence of a progression, fueled by these missing episodes, makes for a really dismal cohesion of plot elements.Also, two of my all time favorite episodes, one in which Ally sues the Catholic church and ergo God on behalf of a little boy dying of cancer, the other, a bitter sweet episode in which a trans-sexual prostitute turns legit, befriends Ally and co. and is ultimately gunned down in cold blood in front of the law firm, are not presented on either of these discs.Quality wise, the discs are pretty decently mastered, with minor aliasing, color smearing and edge enhancement just part in parcel of the overall disregard for television fare mastered to DVD.  In light of Fox's dedication to releasing complete seasons of ""The X-Files"" on DVD, this brilliant little jem of a comedy/drama series definitely needs to be reissued by 20th Century-Fox.

516406,A1JUYF5D6TFFHB,B000035P8M,"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya""","[6, 8]","This is a great DVD set of the hit Fox show Ally Mcbeal, which ran from 1997 to about February of 2002. David E. Kelley's courtroom dramas have always been his strengths, The Practice being his most famous, but with Ally Mcbeal he cut loose and had fun with the show, without straying from the courtroom theme. Ally Mcbeal (played by Calista Flockheart in a role which will always be her signature role no matter what else she does)is a romantic, neurotic but vibrant lawyer who is at the center of the show. From the beginning, she is in crisis as she has broken up with the love of her life Billy (Gil Bellows) and opted to build a successful career as a lawyer in Boston. She meets up with Billy again when they discover they are working in the same law firm- Cage And Fish which is run by Ally's former law school co-ed Richard Fish and by the short eccentric John Cage played by the lovable Peter McNichols.In Season One, Ally roomates with Renee, a successful black lawyer, and things are complicated mostly because Billy is still the love of her life despite that he is now married to the blonde and beautiful Georgia (Courtney Thorne Smith). The show, which was Fox's number one hit for many years, mostly focused on the colorful life of all the lawyers in Cage and Fish- from the greedy, waddle-loving, materialistic, male chauvinist womanizer Richard Fish, to the meek, romantic and sensitive and hilarious John Cage, to the slutty, sassy secretary Elaine, the cold and arrogant ""Sub-Zero"" Nelle Porter, the vicious and bitchy Asian lawyer-turned-judge Lucy Liu, among many others. Guest stars appeared a lot on the show, among them Barry White before he died, Elton John, Al Green, Robert Downey Jr, Dame Edna, Sting and many others. The core of the show was Ally's disastrous love life. Time after time, she loses at love and every relationship she undertakes flounders. In the beginning of the show, she was prim, repressed and serious but as the show progressed to its finale, Ally became more alive and colorful- hallucinating about dancing babies, seeing ghosts- among them that of Billy when he died - and much of the comedy stunts were enhanced by computer graphics. Taking on the most absurd and unbelievable cases, Ally would always pour her soul into the cases because she related to her clients. She was neurotic, she was emotionally off the wall, she was SKINNY! (TOO THIN FOR MANY WHO BELIEVED SHE WAS ANOREXIC OR BULIMIC, WHICH FLOCKHEART STRONGLY DENIED)and in the end she ends up alone with a daughter (through artificial insemination years ago) and living in New York City. I think Ally should have been less picky (she was extremely picky to the point of impossibility) and should have settle for marrying John Cage who was her perfect partner THEY WERE SO ALIKE!! The Season Finale was heartbreaking. I wish they could have all the seasons, which I believe were 6 of them, on DVD sets. Not just this one. If ever that happens, please let us know Amazon.com!! There are still Ally Mcbeal fans out there! She was a great feminist icon- a successful, intelligent, pretty, compassionate woman who made it to the top on her own and had fun doing it !!
