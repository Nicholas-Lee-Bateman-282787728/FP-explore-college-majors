355259,A2SWW3OWEGLN2O,6303085547,Andrew Kear,"[0, 0]","Shaka Zulu may not be the landmark miniseries Roots was, but it does offer probably the best production values of any miniseries.  Director, William C. Faure has a good visual eye for the African landscape. Unlike Roots, Director Faure explores the mythology of Zulu culture that frequently goes into folklore, much like the legend behind the Knights of The Round Table. Some history purist may not be enamored with this approach, but never-the-less it is entertaining. Some may also find the violence gratuitous and the nudity a little overdone.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the miniseries is the class of cultures between the British emissaries and Shaka. The British use their know-how to manipulate Shaka, but he is shrewder than they bargained for.  When the Irish doctor tries to introduce Shaka to Christianity, Shaka turns Christ's message into purely militaristic terms. He believes he can derive power from the British and their religion. To prove this he sends the British into a gully with cannon to fend one of Shaka's enemies. When the British succeed he is even more impressed with their knowledge.I should point out this may be one of the most violent shows ever shown on television. There are scenes of impalement and grisly battle scenes. Henry Cele, playing Shaka, is also a very imposing figure. He is tall with a deep baritone voice, and one of the most ruthless lead characters I can remember.Purists may not think this is a perfect historical drama, but it does cover the basic history of Shaka and his formidable army.

Fighting a war involves careful planning and consideration. The Principles of War were used successfully by Shaka as important tools toward achieving success in war. The application of the 9 principles of war by Shaka can be illustrated below:Clear Objectives:  All his military operations were directed towards a defined, decisive, and attainable objective (except at the end when the British exploited successfully their superior weapons technology).Offensive:  Shaka knew the importance of seizing, retaining, and exploiting the initiative. He achieved success by aggressively moving forward, catching the enemy off-guard to force them to surrender or terminate their resistance.Mass: Shaka's army used the concept of, ""Shock and awe"" of concentrating overwhelming combat power at the decisive place and time shocking his enemies into submission.Economy of Force: Shaka used to focus the right amount of force at the right time at the right location.Manoeuvre: Shaka would place the enemy in a position of disadvantage through the flexible application of combat power.Unity of Command:  For every objective, there was one person responsible for war fighting decisions, the great elephant himself (Shaka).Security: Shaka did not permit the enemy to acquire an unexpected advantage except that due to superior technology, the British ultimately triumphed over himSurprise: Shaka's wars were short, with few lives lost (on his side), and he largely achieved this through the application of the principle of surprise. Shaka would destroy his enemy's will to fight and do it as quickly as possible.Simplicity: Shaka prepared clear, uncomplicated plans and clear, concise orders to ensure thorough understanding. Winning his numerous wars did not depend on his Generals alone, but on the initiative, bravery, and courage of those on the front-line.",5,Great Military Strategist,1138665600,"01 31, 2006",2006,2200,"['mini-series', 'Shaka', 'Zulu', 'compelling', 'story', 'one', 'Africa', 'indeed', 'world', 'greatest', 'military', 'strategists', 'king', 'Zulu', 'nation', 'Shaka.Shaka', 'military', 'genius', 'can', 'be', 'illustrated', 'fact', 'was', 'very', 'familiar', 'employed', 'most', 'principles', 'war', 'modern', 'senior', 'officers', 'learn', 'staff', 'colleges', 'world', 'Fighting', 'war', 'careful', 'planning', 'consideration', 'Principles', 'War', 'were', 'used', 'successfully', 'Shaka', 'important', 'tools', 'achieving', 'success', 'war', 'application', '9', 'principles', 'war', 'Shaka', 'can', 'be', 'illustrated', 'Clear', 'Objectives', 'military', 'operations', 'were', 'directed', 'towards', 'defined', 'decisive', 'attainable', 'objective', 'end', 'when', 'British', 'exploited', 'successfully', 'superior', 'weapons', 'technology', '.Offensive', 'Shaka', 'knew', 'importance', 'seizing', 'retaining', 'exploiting', 'initiative', 'achieved', 'success', 'aggressively', 'moving', 'forward', 'catching', 'enemy', 'off-guard', 'force', 'surrender', 'terminate', 'resistance.Mass', 'Shaka', 'army', 'used', 'concept', 'Shock', 'awe', 'concentrating', 'overwhelming', 'combat', 'power', 'decisive', 'place', 'time', 'shocking', 'enemies', 'submission.Economy', 'Force', 'Shaka', 'used', 'focus', 'right', 'amount', 'force', 'right', 'time', 'right', 'location.Manoeuvre', 'Shaka', 'would', 'place', 'enemy', 'position', 'disadvantage', 'flexible', 'application', 'combat', 'power.Unity', 'Command', 'objective', 'was', 'one', 'person', 'responsible', 'war', 'fighting', 'decisions', 'great', 'elephant', 'Shaka', '.Security', 'Shaka', 'did', 'not', 'permit', 'enemy', 'acquire', 'unexpected', 'advantage', 'due', 'superior', 'technology', 'British', 'ultimately', 'triumphed', 'himSurprise', 'Shaka', 'wars', 'were', 'short', 'few', 'lives', 'lost', 'side', 'largely', 'achieved', 'application', 'principle', 'surprise', 'Shaka', 'would', 'destroy', 'enemy', 'will', 'fight', 'do', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible.Simplicity', 'Shaka', 'prepared', 'clear', 'uncomplicated', 'plans', 'clear', 'concise', 'orders', 'ensure', 'understanding', 'Winning', 'numerous', 'wars', 'did', 'not', 'depend', 'Generals', 'alone', 'initiative', 'bravery', 'courage', 'front-line']",Shaka Zulu VHS

The series then flashbacks to the British embassy going to meet Shaka, running into trouble, and eventually earning his trust after an assasination attempt.  The series then flashbacks to his rise to power from a young boy to the most powerful man on the continent of Africa.  The flashbacks never get confusing, the story is always well told.  The cinematography is brilliant, the acting (especially by Henry Cele in the title role) is very competant, and the characters are very compelling.The series has a little something for everyone, although I think it would appeal more to history buffs like myself.  In addition, there is substantial amounts of nudity, as most of the African women go around topless.  While the nudity didn't detract from the narrative or become gratutitious, it is something to think about before letting younger veiwers watch.All in all i heartily reccomend this mini-series, whether for a really, really rainy day or an hour at at time after work.  8.5/10",5,"Great action, atmosphere, acting: great miniseries",1092528000,"08 15, 2004",2004,1461,"['not', 'despot', 'known', 'many', 'Shaka', 'Zulu', 'controlled', 'empire', 'height', 'power', 'comparable', 'Napolean', 'was', 'as', 'brutal', 'Vlad', 'Impaler', 'very', 'succesfully', 'rise', 'power', 'relationship', 'British', 'envoys', 'eventual', 'fall.As', 'mini-series', 'opens', 'solemn', 'South', 'African', 'representative', 'listens', 'British', 'elite', 'including', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'belittle', 'people', 'then', 'begs', 'let', 'people', 'keep', 'sovreignty', 'series', 'then', 'British', 'embassy', 'going', 'meet', 'Shaka', 'running', 'trouble', 'eventually', 'earning', 'trust', 'assasination', 'attempt', 'series', 'then', 'rise', 'power', 'young', 'boy', 'most', 'powerful', 'man', 'continent', 'Africa', 'flashbacks', 'never', 'get', 'confusing', 'story', 'always', 'well', 'told', 'cinematography', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'especially', 'Henry', 'Cele', 'title', 'role', 'very', 'competant', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'compelling.The', 'series', 'little', 'something', 'everyone', 'think', 'would', 'appeal', 'more', 'history', 'buffs', 'addition', 'substantial', 'amounts', 'nudity', 'most', 'African', 'women', 'go', 'topless', 'nudity', 'did', ""n't"", 'detract', 'narrative', 'become', 'gratutitious', 'something', 'think', 'before', 'letting', 'younger', 'veiwers', 'watch.All', 'i', 'heartily', 'reccomend', 'mini-series', 'really', 'really', 'rainy', 'day', 'hour', 'time', 'work', '8.5/10']",Shaka Zulu VHS

""A New Yorker""","[12, 12]","I've first seen this series when it first came out on TV and it had me at awe and having watched the whole series through again I realized that this is still a great story, very well told and well acted. Filmed entirely on location in South Africa, Shaka Zulu offers an often-compelling look at a tumultuous period in African history, centering around the character of Shaka himself, who emerges as a complex figure teetering on the balance between leader and tyrant. What I like most about Shaka Zulu is that it never bows to stereotype and never simplifies the story down to ""good guys versus bad guys. The British government is clearly in favor of colonizing Africa through fair means or foul; some of the British feel that this is wrong, though they are outvoted by those who feel that British self-interest (and power) takes precedence over the less powerful native nations of Africa. But it's also abundantly clear that Shaka is far from a heroic leader of his people against European colonialism. His rise to power is shown to be a bloody, brutal story of merciless warfare and the quenching of his own personal thirst for revenge; and in the end, we can see that a ""great leader"" can destroy a nation as easily as he can create it.Who can forget Henry Cele? He does a very creditable job as in the title role, radiating the raw power of the war leader while also clearly portraying Shaka's keen and agile mind. The scenes in which Farewell and the others match wits with Shaka are some of the most entertaining, particularly when Dr. Fynn (Robert Powell) tries to direct Shaka toward the study of Christianity; Shaka's reasoned (and alarming, for Dr. Fynn) application of the story of Christ to his own situation is priceless. Edward Fox does his best to portray Lt. Farewell as a fully-developed character, but in this case, the series can be faulted for not being detailed enough, despite the length of the production. The concluding episodes appear to build on aspects of Farewell's character that are insufficiently supported by what we've seen of him in the story. It's worth noting that the listing of Christopher Lee as a co-star is hyperbole: he does appear in the film, but only very briefly at the beginning.One thing that holds Shaka Zulu back from being a really outstanding epic story is the unevenness of the narrative; while some of the episodes are well-paced and interesting all the way through, others have less to offer. There are good production values and great scenery and hundreds of ""real"" extras, a refreshing change from the vacuous CGI laden ""epics"" which flood the cinema. I think the fact this was a mini-series has led to this production being seriously undervalued. While it's far from perfect, it is certainly ambitious, and does capture the epic sweep of Shaka's life and times.",5,"""Never leave an enemy behind or it will rise again to fly at your throat.""",1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,2819,"[""'ve"", 'first', 'seen', 'series', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'TV', 'had', 'awe', 'having', 'watched', 'whole', 'series', 'again', 'realized', 'still', 'great', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'told', 'well', 'acted', 'Filmed', 'entirely', 'location', 'South', 'Africa', 'Shaka', 'Zulu', 'often-compelling', 'look', 'tumultuous', 'period', 'African', 'history', 'centering', 'character', 'Shaka', 'who', 'complex', 'figure', 'teetering', 'balance', 'leader', 'tyrant', 'What', 'like', 'most', 'Shaka', 'Zulu', 'never', 'stereotype', 'never', 'story', 'down', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'British', 'government', 'clearly', 'favor', 'colonizing', 'Africa', 'fair', 'means', 'foul', 'British', 'feel', 'wrong', 'are', 'outvoted', 'who', 'feel', 'British', 'self-interest', 'power', 'precedence', 'less', 'powerful', 'native', 'nations', 'Africa', 'also', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'Shaka', 'far', 'heroic', 'leader', 'people', 'European', 'colonialism', 'rise', 'power', 'shown', 'be', 'bloody', 'brutal', 'story', 'merciless', 'warfare', 'quenching', 'own', 'personal', 'thirst', 'revenge', 'end', 'can', 'see', 'great', 'leader', 'can', 'destroy', 'nation', 'as', 'easily', 'can', 'create', 'it.Who', 'can', 'forget', 'Henry', 'Cele', 'very', 'creditable', 'job', 'title', 'role', 'radiating', 'raw', 'power', 'war', 'leader', 'also', 'clearly', 'portraying', 'Shaka', 'keen', 'agile', 'mind', 'scenes', 'Farewell', 'others', 'match', 'wits', 'Shaka', 'are', 'most', 'entertaining', 'particularly', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Fynn', 'Robert', 'Powell', 'direct', 'Shaka', 'study', 'Christianity', 'Shaka', 'reasoned', 'alarming', 'Dr.', 'Fynn', 'application', 'story', 'Christ', 'own', 'situation', 'priceless', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'best', 'portray', 'Lt.', 'Farewell', 'fully-developed', 'character', 'case', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'faulted', 'not', 'being', 'detailed', 'enough', 'length', 'production', 'concluding', 'episodes', 'appear', 'build', 'aspects', 'Farewell', 'character', 'are', 'insufficiently', 'supported', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'story', 'worth', 'noting', 'listing', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'co-star', 'hyperbole', 'appear', 'film', 'only', 'very', 'briefly', 'beginning.One', 'thing', 'Shaka', 'Zulu', 'back', 'being', 'really', 'outstanding', 'epic', 'story', 'unevenness', 'narrative', 'episodes', 'are', 'well-paced', 'interesting', 'way', 'others', 'have', 'less', 'offer', 'are', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'great', 'scenery', 'hundreds', 'real', 'extras', 'refreshing', 'change', 'vacuous', 'CGI', 'laden', 'epics', 'flood', 'cinema', 'think', 'fact', 'was', 'mini-series', 'led', 'production', 'being', 'seriously', 'undervalued', 'far', 'perfect', 'certainly', 'ambitious', 'capture', 'epic', 'sweep', 'Shaka', 'life', 'times']",Shaka Zulu VHS

However, this is an enthralling (if disturbing) story.Shaka Zulu has grown into a legend of mythical proportions, and my impression of the movie is that, the attempt was made to portray the story as it is told in legend. In other words, there is a lot of fiction, but it is not fiction injected by the writers--it is fiction injected through years of lore and storytelling. I actually like this approach because it somehow seems more real than if Hollywood just made up what they wanted to.The actors did a tremendous job in portraying this story of the man known as Shaka. Truly, this is a gruesome story that is not for the faint of heart. There is enough gore to rival today's movies, and this was 100% a result of Shaka. Pre-Shaka, the Zulus were a small herding community that conducted its wars in a ""jousting match""  manner. Shaka, through intense vengeance and hate changed the whole outlook--not only of the Zulus but also of the whole subcontinent.This story starts with the British attempting to reach Shaka to make an alliance with him. It then moves to a few episodes that show Shaka's youth so as to show his reasons for hatred. After showing Shaka's path to supremacy (and tyranny), we are again taken back to ""present"" when the British are attempting to communicate with Shaka. The whole sequence of this story works very well.If you use short terms to sum up this story, there are several descriptions that could be used: brutal childhood, military brilliance, witchcraft and superstition, British arrogance, and painful love. This is really a fantastic story that covers the gamut of emotions.In the course of the 8 1/2 hours of story, there are a few scenes that stood out to me. Maybe you will have different ones, but the ones that left an impression on me were: 1. The scene where Dr. Fynn is telling Shaka about the King of Kings 2. When the ""swallows"" (or whites) were forced to go to battle with Shaka 3. Shaka's reaction to his new son and 4. Shaka's reaction after the death of his mother. I guess all of these tie together in that they show Shaka's twisted way of thinking.It's hard to say the ending of this movie was triumphant, but it was a relief. Be warned--don't watch this just for entertainment. While entertaining, this is a history lesson that will likely leave you feeling ill to your stomach.

It takes liberties but it well conveys the legend of Shaka, the king that transformed the Zulus from a minor tribe into a major power.The backdrop of the series is a colonial government that is worried about the power and threat of the Zulus. Since the colonial office is in a parsimonious mood, funds are not available for sending troops. Instead, an officer of the royal navy is sent to make contact with Shaka in order to try and make a friendly alliance. This officer is played by Edward Fox.Fox and his band make contact with Shaka but start off at a disadvantage since they are themselves shipwrecked. Even so, they manage to pique Shaka's curiosity and become his valued assets as well as being his prisoners. During the course of this, a series of episodes are used as flashbacks to explain how Shaka came to power.The series is fascinating. It relies on legend and on history. Many of the actors are big names but most of them have only cameo roles. The real stars are the Zulus, particularly Henry Cele (as Shaka) who are telling their own story.

355280,AD50CYPEWH6NN,6303085547,Jon Wynne,"[1, 1]","There are a number of extraordinary facts about this miniseries that jusitfy the claims of &#8220;compelling&#8221; and &#8220;controversial&#8221; made in the product description noted above. Arguably the most prominent fact is that SHAKA ZULU was produced when the country of South Africa was still firmly in the grip of the abhorrent system of racial segregation known as Apartheid.For anyone who has forgotten what this politically-enforced system meant, stories like SHAKA ZULU&#8211;where the central character is a black man who is seen to be a brave and intelligent (albeit flawed) ruler&#8211;simply were not tolerated. The official (read white-enforced) view of Shaka as taught in South African schools at the time was that he was nothing but a tyrant, crazed and bloodthirsty, whose assassination was justified.SHAKA ZULU is an eloquent, epic and extraordinary depiction of Shaka&#8217;s life as written by American writer Joshua Sinclair and realised by white South African filmmaker William C. Faure. The story of how SHAKA ZULU came to be made is only touched upon in the relatively brief interview with Faure that is included in this set. Without doubt, a documentary could be made recounting not only the circumstances under how the production came to be, but also exploring the lives of some of the key personnel, especially Faure and star Henry Cele. Faure died in 1994 and Cele in 2007. It&#8217;s unfortunate they are not around to talk about what was clearly the most significant artistic endeavour of their respective careers.However, let&#8217;s be thankful for what we do have &#8211; this outstanding miniseries, remastered and available on DVD for your home-viewing pleasure.",5,Henry Cele IS Shaka Zulu!,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,1701,"['are', 'number', 'extraordinary', 'facts', 'miniseries', 'jusitfy', 'claims', '8220', 'compelling', '8221', '8220', 'controversial', '8221', 'made', 'product', 'description', 'noted', 'Arguably', 'most', 'prominent', 'fact', 'SHAKA', 'ZULU', 'was', 'produced', 'when', 'country', 'South', 'Africa', 'was', 'still', 'firmly', 'grip', 'abhorrent', 'system', 'racial', 'segregation', 'known', 'Apartheid.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'forgotten', 'what', 'politically-enforced', 'system', 'meant', 'stories', 'SHAKA', 'ZULU', '8211', 'where', 'central', 'character', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'seen', 'be', 'brave', 'intelligent', 'flawed', 'ruler', '8211', 'simply', 'were', 'not', 'tolerated', 'official', 'read', 'white-enforced', 'view', 'Shaka', 'taught', 'South', 'African', 'schools', 'time', 'was', 'was', 'nothing', 'tyrant', 'crazed', 'bloodthirsty', 'assassination', 'was', 'justified.SHAKA', 'ZULU', 'eloquent', 'epic', 'extraordinary', 'depiction', 'Shaka', '8217', 's', 'life', 'written', 'American', 'writer', 'Joshua', 'Sinclair', 'realised', 'white', 'South', 'African', 'filmmaker', 'William', 'C.', 'Faure', 'story', 'how', 'SHAKA', 'ZULU', 'came', 'be', 'made', 'only', 'touched', 'relatively', 'brief', 'interview', 'Faure', 'included', 'set', 'doubt', 'documentary', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'recounting', 'not', 'only', 'circumstances', 'how', 'production', 'came', 'be', 'also', 'exploring', 'lives', 'key', 'personnel', 'especially', 'Faure', 'star', 'Henry', 'Cele', 'Faure', 'died', '1994', 'Cele', '2007', '8217', 's', 'are', 'not', 'talk', 'what', 'was', 'clearly', 'most', 'significant', 'artistic', 'endeavour', 'respective', 'careers.However', 'let', '8217', 'be', 'thankful', 'what', 'do', 'have', '8211', 'outstanding', 'miniseries', 'remastered', 'available', 'DVD', 'home-viewing', 'pleasure']",Shaka Zulu VHS
355281,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,6303085547,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Sadly, I am old enough to remember when the epic 10-part miniseries ""Shaka Zulu"" debuted on American television in the mid-eighties. At the time, TV miniseries were a prominent and successful genre on network stations and many of them combined historical themes with personal stories to become rating blockbusters. This presentation from the South African Broadcasting Company (it is filmed entirely in South Africa) was picked up by cable affiliates to capitalize on that current interest. Like many entertainment programs with a basis in history, ""Shaka Zulu"" has been criticized through the years for playing fast and loose with the facts and for being largely speculative in detailing the more intimate moments of the story. That may well be and is certainly not uncommon for this type of programming, but I never expect a precise historical lesson when watching fictionalized entertainment. What the show did, and quite successfully, was to introduce a completely new world to viewers. This was my first exposure to the Shaka Zulu legend and I found the miniseries refreshingly different. So I jumped at the chance to pick up this DVD set.""Shaka Zulu"" tells the story of a nineteenth century African King who came to power through a combination of cunning and aggression. After uniting the warring tribes of his nation into a spectacular force, he then turned against Colonial rule in a stunning show of strength. It's nice to see the production shot from Shaka Zulu's perspective (as opposed to the British) and the story is characterized by a brutality that was uncommon at the time of its premiere. It is a terrific biography told over 8 hours and 40 minutes, but it is not always a perfect one. The pacing of the show can fluctuate wildly. Some moments are incredibly intense and unforgettable, other segments lull. There are elements of soap opera intrigue dropped into the story to personalize the characters that sometimes seem at odds with the rawness (and grandness) of the rest of the tale. Exiled as a boy, fighting in a ravaged land, and ascending to the top of the political spectrum in the ultimate act of defiance--sometimes there is almost too much going on to keep track of. Other times (including the first episode), you wish that more would be happening. Yet despite some of these minor issues, I heartily recommend ""Shaka Zulu"" to fans of historical fiction.Perhaps the strongest selling point of this interpretation is the bold and fearless leading performance by Henry Cele. Cele is so strong and so magnetic, it is hard to tear your eyes away from him. His role has many layers, and Cele can be both charming and horrifying in equal proportion. The cast also includes some familiar faces in Christopher Lee, Edward Fox, and Trevor Howard. But despite the recognition factor and the uniformly good performances across the board, this really is Cele's piece to carry and he does so quite ably. Again, I won't contend that ""Shaka Zulu"" is a perfect presentation. Some of the authenticity factor is lost, as well, with an English soundtrack. It does, however, look great. The locations, staging, and other technical aspects are noteworthy. And I really think this stands as an interesting counterpoint to what American networks were producing at the time. Bold, riveting, and sometimes unpleasant, ""Shaka Zulu"" (despite a few issues) is still a relevant and entertaining look at a fascinating historical personage.

In less than a decade, the paramount chieftain of the Zulu clan revolutionized the techniques of tribal warfare and fashioned an efficient and terrifying fighting force that devastated the entire region...Set against the emergence of British power in Africa during the early 19th Century, the film provides some valuable insights into comparative cultures...Shaka (Henry Cele) is a man of considerable height, thin, with athletic body and white teeth who can read and write... He is a great warrior, tactically, strategically and physically... He rearms his army with a long-bladed, short-shafted stabbing spear, which forced them to fight at close quarters... He goes for extermination, incorporating the remnants of the clans he smashed into the Zulu, making it increase with numbers and power..The Mini-Series begins with a letter to the British king (George IV) regarding the Zulus' potential threat to the Cape Colony... In an attempt to intimidate Shaka into an alliance with the British empire, the Secretary of War sends a delegation to inner African to meet with the fearful warrior...We see :- The meeting of Nandi, an orphaned princess of the neighboring Langeni clan and Senzangakona, the chief of the then small Zulu tribe... They are instantly attracted to each other... Nandi becomes pregnant, at the same time as Kona's wife, but the marriage did not last... Their marriage violated Zulu custom, and the stigma of this extended to the child...- The couple separated when Shaka was six, and Nandi took her son back to the Langeni, where he passed a fatherless boyhood among a people who despised his mother and made him the butt of endless cruel pranks... He grew up to be bitter and angry, hating his tormentors... The Langeni drove Nandi out, and she finally found shelter with the Dletsheni, a subclan of the powerful Mtetwa...- Shaka ruled with an iron hand from the beginning, distributing instant death for the slightest opposition...- While en route to Shaka's capital, the crew's doctor saves a girl who is in a coma and nearly buried alive by her tribe... Impressed by both the deed and their horses, Shaka agrees to meet with the crew...

To test the alliance and allegiance of the British delegation, Shaka orders them into battle alone against the Ndwandwe warriors...- With his mother's death Shaka becomes openly psychotic...

355297,A96JD9312DHWC,6303085547,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[16, 20]","Empires rise for the sole purpose of cresting in the valleys of time, destined to always find a stumbling block and fall into the sea. From those that never see the setting of the sun to those rapidly built on the dreams and conquests of one man, this is the legacy of anything that rises to power. So has it been with many, and so it was with the birth of the Zulu nation and their prophetically foretold figurehead, Shaka, as they moved forward and conquered all.The validity of this tale, well, that would remain something of a speculative tale since there are so many elements of witchcraft and prediction riddling it. Here, things that might have been mentioned briefly are accented to play out the 220 minutes of production, birthing a legacy of darkness and shadows. Still, as far as a tale adapted for television goes, it was brilliant and enjoyable to watch. Many of the elements that led to the myths of this man and the growth of his empire are included herein, from tales of a son that would one day slay his father and propel his people into power to those that spoke of how he would succumb. It covers the boy himself, his relationship with his mother and how they were outcast, and it shows him grow into something that was propelled only by the need for vengeance. Here, turns that could have prevented this from happening are showcased and the markers making him are defined, helping one understand his accent from nothing to a soldier to a feared ruler.And it also introduces many people that know nothing of history to a name they should all know; that of Shaka Zulu.Presented alongside this is the European side of the coin and what Shaka Zulu meant to it. It shows the overestimation of how expansionism into areas fueled by ""savages"" were, and how the cultures of those neighbors shared were actually more than the occupiers bargained for.Seeing the Zulus as nothing more than barbarians, the British Cape Town establishes itself and survives with little to know interruptions. Then, out of the blue, the Zulus begin taking over everything. Tribesmen could be found running to the hands of the slavers, trying to avoid Zulu spears.And that makes the British apprehensive.Then it one day finds itself looking at a situation of enormous proportions, the Zulu close at hand and the white men knowing nothing about them. Added to this was the fact that the garrisons therein weren't equipped to deal with a force of that size, the journey for reinforcement is a four-month journey by sea, and they could find themselves overrun by then. So, an alternative solution is rendered, sending a crew of men out to negotiate and to showcase fear in order to provide a solution.And thus begins a tale of gunpowder and magic, of chess and tactics, with groups of men from different worlds playing mental games of chess.In the rendering of this tale I personally liked how both sides were shown as players trying to outmaneuver the other. More impressive than that, however, was the fact that Shaka Zulu was portrayed as a powerfully intellectual leader and not as an insignificant threat. Instead of falsely delivering a savage into our midst, the viewer is shown a world outside of the world that the Europeans knew, introduced to its continental customs the people that conquered it with shields and spears. Within those showings, the game of cat and mouse is played and the outcomes, they have more to do with internal afflictions than anything delivered by the white man.It also covers the effects Shaka had on the way wars were fought, on the way people were encouraged, and on the impressive way that one man's mind functioned.And then there's all the lovely impalings that begin to fall like rain, too.",5,Turning The Tides of Warfare,1058140800,"07 14, 2003",2003,3717,"['Empires', 'rise', 'sole', 'purpose', 'cresting', 'valleys', 'time', 'destined', 'always', 'find', 'stumbling', 'block', 'fall', 'sea', 'never', 'see', 'setting', 'sun', 'rapidly', 'built', 'dreams', 'conquests', 'one', 'man', 'legacy', 'anything', 'power', 'So', 'been', 'many', 'was', 'birth', 'Zulu', 'nation', 'prophetically', 'foretold', 'figurehead', 'Shaka', 'moved', 'forward', 'conquered', 'all.The', 'validity', 'tale', 'well', 'would', 'remain', 'something', 'speculative', 'tale', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'elements', 'witchcraft', 'prediction', 'riddling', 'Here', 'things', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'mentioned', 'briefly', 'are', 'accented', 'play', 'out', '220', 'minutes', 'production', 'birthing', 'legacy', 'darkness', 'shadows', 'Still', 'as', 'far', 'tale', 'adapted', 'television', 'was', 'brilliant', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'Many', 'elements', 'led', 'myths', 'man', 'growth', 'empire', 'are', 'included', 'herein', 'tales', 'son', 'would', 'one', 'day', 'slay', 'father', 'propel', 'people', 'power', 'spoke', 'how', 'would', 'succumb', 'boy', 'relationship', 'mother', 'how', 'were', 'outcast', 'grow', 'something', 'was', 'propelled', 'only', 'need', 'vengeance', 'Here', 'could', 'have', 'prevented', 'happening', 'are', 'showcased', 'markers', 'making', 'are', 'defined', 'helping', 'one', 'understand', 'accent', 'nothing', 'soldier', 'feared', 'ruler.And', 'also', 'many', 'people', 'know', 'nothing', 'history', 'name', 'should', 'know', 'Shaka', 'Zulu.Presented', 'European', 'side', 'coin', 'what', 'Shaka', 'Zulu', 'meant', 'overestimation', 'how', 'expansionism', 'areas', 'fueled', 'savages', 'were', 'how', 'cultures', 'neighbors', 'shared', 'were', 'actually', 'more', 'occupiers', 'bargained', 'for.Seeing', 'Zulus', 'nothing', 'more', 'barbarians', 'British', 'Cape', 'Town', 'little', 'know', 'interruptions', 'Then', 'blue', 'Zulus', 'begin', 'taking', 'over', 'everything', 'Tribesmen', 'could', 'be', 'found', 'running', 'hands', 'slavers', 'trying', 'avoid', 'Zulu', 'spears.And', 'British', 'apprehensive.Then', 'one', 'day', 'looking', 'situation', 'enormous', 'proportions', 'Zulu', 'close', 'hand', 'white', 'men', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'Added', 'was', 'fact', 'garrisons', 'therein', 'were', ""n't"", 'equipped', 'deal', 'force', 'size', 'journey', 'reinforcement', 'four-month', 'journey', 'sea', 'could', 'find', 'overrun', 'then', 'So', 'alternative', 'solution', 'rendered', 'sending', 'crew', 'men', 'negotiate', 'showcase', 'fear', 'order', 'provide', 'solution.And', 'thus', 'tale', 'gunpowder', 'magic', 'chess', 'tactics', 'groups', 'men', 'different', 'worlds', 'playing', 'mental', 'games', 'chess.In', 'rendering', 'tale', 'personally', 'liked', 'how', 'sides', 'were', 'shown', 'players', 'trying', 'outmaneuver', 'other', 'More', 'impressive', 'however', 'was', 'fact', 'Shaka', 'Zulu', 'was', 'portrayed', 'powerfully', 'intellectual', 'leader', 'not', 'insignificant', 'threat', 'Instead', 'falsely', 'delivering', 'savage', 'midst', 'viewer', 'shown', 'world', 'world', 'Europeans', 'knew', 'introduced', 'continental', 'customs', 'people', 'conquered', 'shields', 'spears', 'showings', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'played', 'outcomes', 'have', 'more', 'do', 'internal', 'afflictions', 'anything', 'delivered', 'white', 'man.It', 'also', 'effects', 'Shaka', 'had', 'way', 'wars', 'were', 'fought', 'way', 'people', 'were', 'encouraged', 'impressive', 'way', 'one', 'man', 'mind', 'functioned.And', 'then', 'lovely', 'impalings', 'begin', 'fall', 'rain', 'too']",Shaka Zulu VHS
