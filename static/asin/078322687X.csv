56853,AYGHUCNGQ0HMF,078322687X,aaron wittenberg,"[144, 167]","There are plenty of reviews here about the movie, so there is no sense in writing another.This review is about the DVD. I will tell you up front that this DVD looks like a direct copy off VHS. I have seen the VHS version about 2 times this year and when the title song comes on, the audio fades in and out. Not bad, but you can definitely see some age in it. The DVD is EXACTLY the same. The sound is of no higher quality.There is no widescreen, just a full screen with the same picture quality as VHS. It's not horrible, but if you are the type of person who buys DVDs for the superior picture quality, you are definitely going to be unhappy with this.The movie itself is EXCELLENT, I love it, but the DVD transfer from VHS isn't the best.As for bonus features, you get bios for all of the actors. The trouble is, the information included is the same as you can find on the internet movie database (imdb) as well as fan sites. If you have read a fair amount on any of the actors and know their biography fairly well, this DVD offers nothing new.There are also some brief production notes about where and how this movie was done, and some quotes from the cast and crew.Again, if you have done any research online and gone to any fan sites or even a site dedicated to John Hughes, you will find nothing new here. No interviews, a little behind the scenes, some background detail, but in the big picture, not much else.Just a forewarning.I bought the DVD because unlike VHS tapes, a DVD CD doesn't wear out. But if you watch the VHS version, then the DVD, the quality is the same. DVD is not any better.So overall, EXCELLENT movie, but not a great transfer. Still, if you are a fan, definitely add it to your collection, but if you buy DVDs for the extras, you will be very disappointed with this.",3,Review of the DVD transfer,991440000,"06 2, 2001",2001,1795,"['are', 'plenty', 'reviews', 'here', 'movie', 'sense', 'writing', 'another.This', 'review', 'DVD', 'will', 'tell', 'up', 'front', 'DVD', 'direct', 'copy', 'VHS', 'have', 'seen', 'VHS', 'version', '2', 'times', 'year', 'when', 'title', 'song', 'audio', 'fades', 'Not', 'bad', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'age', 'DVD', 'EXACTLY', 'same', 'sound', 'higher', 'widescreen', 'just', 'full', 'screen', 'same', 'picture', 'quality', 'VHS', 'not', 'horrible', 'are', 'type', 'person', 'who', 'DVDs', 'superior', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'definitely', 'going', 'be', 'unhappy', 'this.The', 'movie', 'EXCELLENT', 'love', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'VHS', ""n't"", 'best.As', 'bonus', 'features', 'get', 'bios', 'actors', 'trouble', 'information', 'included', 'same', 'can', 'find', 'internet', 'movie', 'database', 'imdb', 'as', 'well', 'fan', 'sites', 'have', 'read', 'fair', 'amount', 'actors', 'know', 'biography', 'fairly', 'well', 'DVD', 'nothing', 'new.There', 'are', 'also', 'brief', 'production', 'notes', 'where', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'quotes', 'cast', 'crew.Again', 'have', 'done', 'research', 'online', 'gone', 'fan', 'even', 'site', 'dedicated', 'John', 'Hughes', 'will', 'find', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'interviews', 'little', 'scenes', 'background', 'detail', 'big', 'picture', 'not', 'much', 'forewarning.I', 'bought', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'DVD', 'CD', ""n't"", 'wear', 'out', 'watch', 'VHS', 'version', 'then', 'DVD', 'quality', 'same', 'DVD', 'not', 'better.So', 'overall', 'EXCELLENT', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'transfer', 'Still', 'are', 'fan', 'definitely', 'add', 'collection', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'extras', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed']",The Breakfast Club

56860,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,078322687X,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[5, 5]","I remember seeing ""The Breakfast Club"" at my 15th birthday party where my friends rented the ""teen"" movie. Falling in love with it then and there, it has always been one of my favorite 80s movies next toDesperately Seeking SusanandFerris Bueller's Day Off Bueller...Bueller... Edition (Special Collector's Edition).And though I've seen it several times since then, I really couldn't remember why I liked the movie so much. I already own the other two films on DVD and so I decided to buy THE BREAKFAST CLUB (FLASHBACK EDITION) DVD, not only because of the recent untimely death of director/writer John Hughes, but also to add to my library.Watching it again last night and it all comes back to why this is one of my favorite movies, not just of the 80s, but of all time.The story is a simple one: five young adults who happen to represent the archetypal teenager--the jock, the nerd, the goth recluse, the delinquent rebel, and the rich and popular prom queen--all spend a Saturday morning in detention together. As the course of the day goes on they fight, get stoned, and open up to each other with brutal honesty that reveals, under the surface, that they have more in common then they'd like to think. In the end, they learn something about themselves and each other that they didn't have that morning.It's such a great story about how everyone has problems and that things are not always what they seem, especially for young adults.Hughes's story is captivating and comical and the ensemble cast is brilliant!The DVD transfer looks great and there's some goodies in the special features:======  SPECIAL FEATURES  ======""Sincerely Yours""--51:08 minutes--Documentary featuring 12 segments with a play all feature that discuss the ""Breakfast Club,"" John Hughes, the characters, and the iconic song by Simple Minds ""Don't You Forget About Me."" Stars of the film Judd Nelson, Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy and John Kapelos (the janitor), among others, appear in the featurettes, which was filmed sometime between 2003 and 2008. Unfortunately Molly Ringwald and Emilio Estevez do NOT make an appearance.""The Origins Of The Brat Pack""--05:35 minutes--Short featurette with the above cast members, journalists and writer David Blum who talks about the story that he wrote for ""New York Magazine""--back in the 80s--which started the whole ""brat pack"" moniker for the young actors in the film and other famous young actors of the day.Feature Commentary with Judd Nelson and Anthony Michael Hall.I didn't own the previous DVD editionThe Breakfast Club (High School Reunion Collection), so I don't know if these are the same or different than those special features.THE BREAKFAST CLUB is still a great film to watch and reminds us of what it was like back then when we weren't taken seriously because we were teenagers.

I graduated from High School that year and found life was more confusing than when I began it 4 years earlier.  I was very moved, by the Writing of The Movie Writers and the actors seemed very comfortable in dealing with eachother in this movie.  I thought the last 15 or 20 minutes seemed a little bit of an overkill to it because of the shift of the dialogue to various places in the School.  That approach hurt the early goings of The Movie, I think, but what do I know?  I think it very closely tried to resemble ""Rebel Without A Cause"", though without a lot of dramatics since it was soley teleplayed in the school.

56867,A26GKRY72ROT25,078322687X,"Amazon Customer ""HomeTheaterGuy""","[18, 21]","This movie is a classic and it will stand the test of time. This is the second &quot;teen coming of age&quot; installment from John Hues, and round 2 for Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall. The first installment, Sixteen Candles, was more of a sexual coming of age movie whereas The Breakfast Club is more of a coming of age for one's character and social awareness. Where they are &quot;teetering&quot; with; do they stay with the social allegiances of their perspective pack, or do they listen to that inner voice...the voice of reason, maturity and human compassion that's not bound to any &quot;click&quot;. I also like the choice of actors here; I think they all fit like pieces in a puzzle and make their characters totally believable. I am in the same age range as almost the entire cast and I was a senior in High school when this film came out. Allot of reviews seem to put this film within the Junior High crowd but I feel it's much more mature than that. The very message that it's trying to get across isn't understood in real life until we get close to 18 or so. The story is simple; 5 kids have to come into school on a Saturday for detention. At first they try to segregate themselves according to their school social standings. Inevitably they find out that they are more alike than they ever thought. The movie, in my eyes, is broken into 3 parts; the first part is pure character development. This is where you (the viewer) get to know each person they way they are supposed to be seen with their everyday face. At first, they act the way they think they should act, and stand up for what they always had, with out question or defiance. They stay true to their cause never steering away for a second. The second part of the film is where the movie itself develops. These 5 separate entities realize that they are variations of the same person. They have the same desires and anguishes. Their pressures and stresses are the same even though it's generated from very different sources.The jock (Emilio Estevez) has the pressure to be on top of his sport (wrestling). In return for this he gets attention from his dad, coaches and keeps his standing within his social group. This is his priority in life and he doesn't stray.The Princess (Molly Ringwald) has to conform and obey the rules of her social group in order to be accepted and keep her standing within the group. She keeps her eyes closed; mouth shut and goes along for the ride.The Metal Head/criminal (Judd Nelson) is an angry guy! He wears the physical and mental scars of growing up in an abusive house. He hates most people, like the ones Emilio and Molly play, because in his eyes, they have had a free ticket and earned nothing...things are handed to them because of their social and/or economical standings. On the other hand, he feels that he's on a whole other plain because his eyes have been beaten open and he was forced to grow up a little faster than he wanted too or was ready too. I feel that Judd Nelson's character is the most crucial to the movie. He is the key to this whole new self-awareness for everyone, including himself.The nerd (Anthony Michael Hall) is the quintessential geek. His every woken moment is spent learning. He hides behind his grades and in fact, he wants to be more accepted by the &quot;cooler&quot; groups. He also is a little &quot;cocky&quot; about his better grades and academically superiority to the other people in the room.The weirdo (Ally Sheedy) is a loner and an outcast. She doesn't have friends that we (the viewers) know of. Because her parents ignore her, She feels ugly and without a place in the world. She is starving for positive attention. I think her character was needed in this movie to balance off the cast. It would have left out a very critical part of teen angst!Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) is the &quot;Villain&quot; of the movie. To the kids, he represents the out of touch older generation and the mean spirited, high testosterone adult. For Richard Vernon, these kids are the source of his anger and agony. He has lost touch with the younger generation for 1 reason, he got older...and the older you get, the harder it is to relate to youth. Youth recycles right before your eyes, but you keep getting older. His character is the key that releases these kids.

These kinds of characters are also real people. Real people who are in every high school across America. If you don't think so, you need to look harder. They may not always act or look the same as others, but they are there. A bunch of high schoolers have to serve detention together on a Saturday. Molly Ringwald is the Princess, Anthony Michael Hall is the geek, Emilio Estevez is the jock, Judd Nelson is the loner, and Ally Sheedy is the basket case. These different backgrounds and personalities come together and clash. They are pretty much forced to spend this time together and thoughts and feelings come out. Somebody dismisses it because it's a whinefest?. Get over it. This is life. It's one big whinefest!. The young actors(well, at the time)are all teriffic. They really bring these distinct individuals to life and make them believeable. I mean, really believeable. Paul Gleason is on hand as the principal who keeps an eye on the group. The ending might be a little too predictable and happy, but so what?. Judd Nelson gives the strongest performance here. He is really good. Hughes really writes teen life well. He does it a million times better than any writer writing the so called &quot;teen films&quot; of today.

This is definitely the best that the film has ever looked, other than at the theater. Colors are natural, blacks deep, detail as much as there can be with the elements used, and there are very few print artifacts; those that are there pass so quickly that they don't intrude on the proceedings. There is a fine sheen of film grain that is supposed to be there, without a hint of digital manipulation. If this is an old HD master that was used for the HD-DVD, I would say that it still looks really good. It couldn't get much better than it this, image-wise.My only complaint would be the sound. I believe that The Breakfast Club was in mono when it came out, so everything spills from the center channel with a bit of spread to the other channels. Dialogue sounds muffled and dated, which makes me wonder if Universal couldn't have gone back to the original masters and remixed the audio for a more articulated and defined sound. A lot can be done with the computer technology today and I wish it would've been utilized here. Other than that, I am very happy to see this classic from my youth in such great shape.

Inevitably, any foray into the cinema blockbusters of the 1980s will evoke a number of titles, such as Back To The Future, Beverly Hills Cop, or The Goonies. The Breakfast Club is certainly one of those films, and it's almost universally cited as one of the preeminent films from the era. If you enjoy relationship films, it's easy to see why, because The Breakfast Club is a movie built solely on the strength of its characters and the conflict surrounding them...Shermer High School principal Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) oversees the Saturday morning detention of five high school students from differing backgrounds. Confining them to the library, he fails to relate to them as individuals with a future or a purpose. Making up the cast of misfit characters are Andy Clark (Emilio Estevez), Brian Ralph Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), John Bender (Judd Nelson), Claire Standish (Molly Ringwold), and Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy). Forced to spend their Saturday together, the five students strike up a conversation (with the exception of the muted Allison). For the most part, their conversation consists of picking on each other and making jokes at each other's expense.Continually butting heads with Principal Vernon, the teens help pass the time by uniting against Vernon and by engaging in conversation with the infinitely wise janitor, Carl (John Kapelos). Eventually, each student (including Allison, who eventually opens up) comes to understand the plight of the other. The pretty princess Claire doesn't have a perfect life. Neither does the popular wrestling champ Andy. Brian and Allison have their own problems just like anyone else, and John puts up a front to look tougher and more hardened than he really is. In the end, the five develop a lifelong bond - with Claire and John igniting a budding relationship...Sporting a smash hit soundtrack headlined by Simple Minds' ""Don't You (Forget About Me),"" The Breakfast Club attained instant cult classic status. The 'brat pack' came to define a generation and made its mark in Hollywood. A light-hearted comedy, blended together with a series of relationships between different people, The Breakfast Club's true strength lies with the ability of its audience to relate to the issues at hand. The characters recount stories from their lives that in one way or another are easily relatable to most every American who attended high school.It's this universal familiarity with the themes depicted by The Breakfast Club that make it a classic adored by millions. Despite the longings of teenagers throughout time to forge unique identities and set themselves aside as revolutionary, in the end, most high schools sport the same cast of characters, and those various roles have remained unchanged for most of the last several decades. As one of the most memorable films of the 80's decade, The Breakfast Club is a definite must-see movie...The DVD Report",5,An integral part of 80's pop culture...,1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,3052,"['One', 'defining', 'movies', '80', 'decade', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'entertaining', 'film', 'nostalgia', 'many', 'viewers', 'Inevitably', 'foray', 'cinema', 'blockbusters', '1980s', 'will', 'evoke', 'number', 'titles', 'such', 'Back', 'Future', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Cop', 'Goonies', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'certainly', 'one', 'films', 'almost', 'universally', 'cited', 'one', 'preeminent', 'films', 'era', 'enjoy', 'relationship', 'films', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'movie', 'built', 'solely', 'strength', 'characters', 'conflict', 'surrounding', 'Shermer', 'High', 'School', 'principal', 'Richard', 'Vernon', 'Paul', 'Gleason', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'detention', 'five', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'differing', 'backgrounds', 'Confining', 'library', 'relate', 'individuals', 'future', 'purpose', 'Making', 'up', 'cast', 'misfit', 'characters', 'are', 'Andy', 'Clark', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'Brian', 'Ralph', 'Johnson', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'John', 'Bender', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'Claire', 'Standish', 'Molly', 'Ringwold', 'Allison', 'Reynolds', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'Forced', 'spend', 'Saturday', 'together', 'five', 'students', 'strike', 'up', 'conversation', 'exception', 'muted', 'Allison', 'most', 'part', 'conversation', 'picking', 'other', 'making', 'jokes', 'other', 'expense.Continually', 'butting', 'heads', 'Principal', 'Vernon', 'teens', 'help', 'pass', 'time', 'uniting', 'Vernon', 'engaging', 'conversation', 'infinitely', 'wise', 'janitor', 'Carl', 'John', 'Kapelos', 'Eventually', 'student', 'including', 'Allison', 'who', 'eventually', 'up', 'understand', 'plight', 'other', 'pretty', 'princess', 'Claire', ""n't"", 'have', 'perfect', 'life', 'popular', 'wrestling', 'champ', 'Andy', 'Brian', 'Allison', 'have', 'own', 'problems', 'just', 'anyone', 'else', 'John', 'up', 'front', 'look', 'tougher', 'more', 'hardened', 'really', 'end', 'five', 'develop', 'lifelong', 'bond', 'Claire', 'John', 'igniting', 'budding', 'relationship', 'Sporting', 'smash', 'hit', 'soundtrack', 'headlined', 'Simple', 'Minds', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Forget', 'Me', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'attained', 'instant', 'cult', 'classic', 'status', ""'brat"", 'pack', 'came', 'define', 'generation', 'made', 'mark', 'Hollywood', 'light-hearted', 'comedy', 'blended', 'together', 'series', 'relationships', 'different', 'people', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'true', 'strength', 'ability', 'audience', 'relate', 'issues', 'hand', 'characters', 'recount', 'stories', 'lives', 'one', 'way', 'are', 'easily', 'relatable', 'most', 'American', 'who', 'attended', 'high', 'school.It', 'universal', 'familiarity', 'themes', 'depicted', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'make', 'classic', 'adored', 'millions', 'longings', 'teenagers', 'time', 'forge', 'unique', 'identities', 'set', 'aside', 'revolutionary', 'end', 'most', 'high', 'schools', 'sport', 'same', 'cast', 'characters', 'various', 'roles', 'have', 'remained', 'unchanged', 'most', 'last', 'several', 'decades', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'films', '80', 'decade', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'definite', 'must-see', 'movie', 'DVD', 'Report']",The Breakfast Club

But as the day goes on they talk and learn their strengths differences and rights and wrongs and they all change each others lives. There is a mean detention teacher that harasses them and is very cruel yet they stay strong.The brat-pack kids were never expected to make a movie as good as this is.

Beings that I wasn't born until the year this film was released my idea of high school life finds no merit in this film whatsoever and I in no way shape or form can relate.  Thus I can't agree with the above statement.The film is about a group of kids from all walks of life getting stuck in detention one Saturday.  None of them are friends and most of them can't stand each other but by the end of the day they realize that they are all alike in many ways and become close friends.  There's Andy (Estevez) the jock and Brian (Hall) the brain and John (Nelson) the bully and Claire (Ringwald) the rich girl and Allison (Sheedy) the weird girl.  Under the strict watch of Principal Richard Vernon (Gleason) the group is commanded to stay silent and write a paper explaining who they are.The problem is none of them really know who they are.The premise of the film is a good one and holds promise for a great movie, and I feel that if it were tackled now it would hold a lot more weight.  To me the majority of the acting was overacted and came across forced and amateur, but then again, acting has improved so much over the course of 20+ years.  That's not in anyway meant to slam this movie.  It's hard to judge a movie like this critically since it's so well loved and praised by the general public, but I have to be honest and say that I expected a little more, with all the hype that is.  After I finished watching it I asked a bunch of my friends (all of whom are in their 30's) what they thought of this film and none of them cared for it.So I guess it wasn't just me.A word of advise...if you're not a child of the 80's, and I mean that as in `if you weren't a high school student during the 80's' then you won't get out of this movie all that you are meant to.  Sure, the moral still holds weight today and it's a subject (the whole acceptance thing and learning to find common grounds and not judging others just because their different than you...) that needs to be addressed...I just think it's been addressed in better ways before.

It is an indelible part of cultural history and remains as fresh and brash as ever today.  While teenagers can certainly not be broken down into five distinct types, the five students forced to spend their Saturday at school in detention do a pretty good job of covering the basics.  You have Claire, the popular prom queen type, played by the wonderful Molly Ringwald, the jock (Emilio Estevez), the brain (Anthony Michael Hall), the weirdo (Alley Sheedy), and the disrespectful criminal (Judd Nelson)--five students who are complete strangers to each other and totally different personalities.  Terrorizing and threatening them is an older teacher intent on enforcing discipline among them.  The criminal is determined to foment an insurrection, and eventually the strict supervision of the students breaks down.  At first, the students yell at and fight with one another and are especially antagonistic toward the juvenile delinquent among them.  As the day progresses, the students begin to tell their own stories--who they are, why they are in detention, etc.  Their conversations weave back and forth between insults and incriminations and words of sympathy and concern.  They eventually start roaming the school halls, leading to the classic scenes of them skidding across the halls in a mad flight to return to the library before the teacher returns to check on them.  Somehow, the five eventually do open up to each other, confessing secrets, forming friendships, and realizing that the problems they considered their own are shared to some degree with each other.This is a great movie and one that appealed directly to young people--everyone can understand problems with overbearing or neglectful parents, grades, peer pressure, drugs, etc.  I must say that I sometimes felt the changes between hateful exchanges and sympathetic dialogue came a little abruptly, though; I for one never saw any redeeming quality in Judd Nelson's character.  I also couldn't believe some of the destruction that was done to school property over the course of the day.  Anthony Michael Hall was brilliant in his role and provided some very funny moments, but I as a former brain did not see much of myself in him.  The real point of the film, though, is that teenagers all have problems they must deal with, that the folks not in your little group or clique are just as human as you are and worthy of respect, and that adults seemingly just cannot understand their kids for the most part, and that very fact only heightens the need for teenagers to depend on one another.I should also mention the music.  ""Don't You Forget About Me"" by Simple Minds was perhaps the most-played song of the entire decade, and it is rightly associated forever with this movie.

TBC is what I personally consider to be one one of his top three best movies. It's amazing to me the same man responsible for a movie like this went on to do movies like Baby's Day Out. But I digress.The Breakfast Club brings together some of the most famous of the Brat Pack, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Michael Anthony Hall, Emilio Estevez, and Ally Sheedy as a group of high school students (interestingly enough, only two were actually high school aged at the time) sent to Saturday morning detention. All come from very different walks of lives and had little to do with one another but now are forced to endure each other.When you really look at it, it's strange how such a simple plot for a movie can turn into such a well-loved and memorable movie, isn't it? I think it's because the characters are so great as well as the acting itself. I couldn't see anyone but Judd Nelson as Bender (though another random fact is originally the role was intended for Emilio Estevez).It really is a well-acted movie by all the principal actors. Each character represents a ""clique"" you probably knew in high school and there's likely a character that, to some degree, you'll be able to relate to the most which is another thing I think adds to the movie.As for the blu-ray quality, it was okay. I don't remember the quality on the VHS well enough to compare, but I have no complaints about the blu-ray.If you've never seen it, I think The Breakfast Club is very worth a viewing.",5,The Breakfast Club,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,1585,"['Breakfast', 'Club', '1985', 'teen', 'comedy', 'written', 'none', 'other', 'John', 'Hughes', 'king', '80s', 'teen', 'movies', 'TBC', 'what', 'personally', 'consider', 'be', 'one', 'one', 'top', 'three', 'best', 'movies', 'amazing', 'same', 'man', 'responsible', 'movie', 'went', 'do', 'movies', 'Baby', 'Day', 'Out', 'digress.The', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'together', 'most', 'famous', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'Michael', 'Anthony', 'Hall', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'group', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'only', 'two', 'were', 'actually', 'high', 'school', 'aged', 'time', 'sent', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'detention', 'come', 'very', 'different', 'walks', 'lives', 'had', 'little', 'do', 'one', 'now', 'are', 'forced', 'endure', 'other.When', 'really', 'look', 'strange', 'how', 'such', 'simple', 'plot', 'movie', 'can', 'turn', 'such', 'well-loved', 'memorable', 'movie', ""n't"", 'think', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'anyone', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'Bender', 'random', 'fact', 'originally', 'role', 'was', 'intended', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', '.It', 'really', 'well-acted', 'movie', 'principal', 'actors', 'character', 'clique', 'probably', 'knew', 'high', 'school', 'likely', 'character', 'degree', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'most', 'thing', 'think', 'movie.As', 'blu-ray', 'quality', 'was', 'okay', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'quality', 'VHS', 'well', 'enough', 'compare', 'have', 'complaints', 'blu-ray.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'think', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'very', 'worth', 'viewing']",The Breakfast Club

Wanting nothing to do with each other, they nevertheless begin to interact and, by the end of the day, they have learned a great deal about themselves and the others, completely shattering the concept of a stereotype.There's a 5-star movie here screaming to get out, as exemplified by the wonderful scene in which the kids just sit down on the floor and talk about themselves and challenge each others assumptions.  It's hampered by many lesser elements, such as one-dimensional adult characters and silly posing (such as the MTV flavored dance scenes, which are unrealistic and painfully bad).

Though this movie is usually considered a ""chick flick"" I have no problem watching it. Otherwise, besides certian immoral content in the film, that i try to skip anyways, this movie is great! I'm amused by the scenario the characters are put in. I can actually relate to Brian(the nerd). Its kind of scary though, cause he shares my name. As for the rest characters, they just made me laugh to no end. The basket case I found particularly cool. I won't comment on the emotional aspect of the film, but I will say I felt it and just leave it at that. Oh and as a 17 year old, trust me, its great to see teens actually act like teens!!!!! Now a days it seems most teen flicks are bassically movies about sex crazed monsters(no ones REALLY like that). AND IT'S NOT FUNNY, its just kind of grose.

The movie, which involves five teens who don't even know each other and have absolutely nothing in common thrown together for an all-day Saturday detention, starts out slowly. But it soon picks up as we witness the feelings that each of these students have toward their families (particularly their parents) coming out and the complexity of feelings they have toward each other developing. Not till close to the end, however, do the barriers that each has erected toward the others (and toward those who are not like them in general) begin to fall down and do they truly appreciate the others for who they are and for the struggles they are enduring.This is a movie worth watching, even if you're long past your high school years.

Nevertheless the movie isn't bad as I make it out to sound. I grew up in the '80s and on John Hughes' films. I thought his coming of age teenage flicks like ""Pretty in Pink"", ""Sixteen Candles"", and ""The Breakfast Club"" at the time represented the lives of teenagers. That was almost twenty years ago and teenagers today are more angst-ridden and are dealing with a lot more serious problems. There really isn't much of plot in ""The Breakfast Club"". It simply revolves around a circle of high school students who end up getting detention and are forced to serve it on a Saturday morning. There is the jock Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), the rebel John Bender (Judd Nelson), popular girl Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), the outcast Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy), and the geek Brian Ralph Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall). Principal Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) has his students in the library which forces them to talk to each other. Although it appears that they are different, the five students eventually realize that they really are not all that different despite the fact they come from different backgrounds and hang out with different crews. My favorite moment in the film were the more dramatic scenes when each character are forced to evaluate themselves. I also liked it when everyone tries to escape the library and get out of detention.

56948,A146D2LYLICNLS,078322687X,eric_f,"[2, 2]","Anyone who talks about movies from the 80's will surely mention &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; as being one of the most popular films of that decade. Although a little dated in some ways, it has certainly stood the test of time and remains a truly well made movie. The plot is simple: a nerd (Anthony Michael Hall), a popular snooty princess (Molly Ringwald), a basketcase (Ally Sheedy), a jock (Emilio Estevez) and a rebel outcast (Judd Nelson) are all forced to sit together for a day of detention for offenses they committed. Inevitably, they can't stand each other at first and begin bickering amongst themselves, throwing out insults left and right and making it clear that neither one of them wants to be in the presence of each other. But as the hours pass by, their bickering forces themselves to reveal the painful truths about their personal lives and open up to each other. Eventually, they all realize that each one of them has their own imperfections and the images they've created for themselves are nothing more than masks to hide their flaws. What was originally a regular everyday detension session turns into a group therapy meeting, although not without a lot of pain, tears and making oneself vulnerable. By the end of the day they all walk out of the school changed people, seeing the world in a whole new light. Ironically, they end up being set free by being held prisoners.What makes &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; work so well is not only the actors' performances but also the great script. When a movie takes place in only one setting (as is the case here) the script must carry it, otherwise it has nothing to go by. Whereas other movies might have breathtaking cinematography, non-stop action or dazzling special effects to make it appealing, &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; only has 5 people confined together in one space. Therefore dialog is crucial. And it delivers in that regard.This isn't to say that &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; is perfect. While the movie has aged well, some scenes haven't. For example, when they're all dancing to the music. That scene has &quot;80's MTV music video&quot; written all over it.

56951,A84UFSF2SZS2W,078322687X,"EriKa ""E""","[2, 3]","A classic 1980s teen film. It has moments that shine, showing the cruel nature of high school cliques and alienation. We have clear cut stereotyped characters here who are driven by excellent dialogue. The group is so diverse when they first arrive at their Saturday detention, and in fact, their reasons for having to be in Saturday school are what bring them together. This group of youths who would never otherwise talk to one another is forced to be together for eight hours, and to bring them together a little quicker, we have a self-satisfied, diabolical school principal. We also have the social outcast ""criminal"" John Bender (played by Judd Nelson) who has marijuana to bring the group together. Each person has a different social standing and a different attitude toward life, but they discover that they have a lot in common, including insecurities and uncertainties about their identities and their lives. Even if their solidarity lasted for that one afternoon, they might have cause to think twice before stereotyping again. This is the best of this genre film, and strangely most of the people starring in the film have done relatively little since this film. Ally Sheedy has starred in flops, Molly Ringwald retreated to France (although she has made a few films and had a failed attempt at a tv sitcom), Emilio Estevez does films sometimes which have a modest amount of success, Anthony Michael Hall shows up occasionally (as in Pirates of the Silicon Valley, in which he plays Bill Gates), and Judd Nelson has made a few films and starred on the sitcom Suddenly Susan for a few years before leaving to try to revive his film career.",4,"DON'T MESS WITH THE BULL, YOUNG MAN, YOU'LL GET THE HORNS",985564800,"03 26, 2001",2001,1650,"['classic', '1980s', 'teen', 'film', 'moments', 'shine', 'showing', 'cruel', 'nature', 'high', 'school', 'cliques', 'alienation', 'have', 'clear', 'cut', 'stereotyped', 'characters', 'here', 'who', 'are', 'driven', 'excellent', 'dialogue', 'group', 'so', 'diverse', 'when', 'first', 'arrive', 'Saturday', 'detention', 'fact', 'reasons', 'having', 'be', 'Saturday', 'school', 'are', 'what', 'bring', 'together', 'group', 'youths', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'otherwise', 'talk', 'one', 'forced', 'be', 'together', 'eight', 'hours', 'bring', 'together', 'little', 'quicker', 'have', 'self-satisfied', 'diabolical', 'school', 'principal', 'also', 'have', 'social', 'outcast', 'criminal', 'John', 'Bender', 'played', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'who', 'marijuana', 'bring', 'group', 'together', 'person', 'different', 'social', 'standing', 'different', 'attitude', 'life', 'discover', 'have', 'lot', 'common', 'including', 'insecurities', 'uncertainties', 'identities', 'lives', 'Even', 'solidarity', 'lasted', 'one', 'afternoon', 'might', 'have', 'cause', 'think', 'twice', 'before', 'stereotyping', 'again', 'best', 'genre', 'film', 'strangely', 'most', 'people', 'starring', 'film', 'have', 'done', 'relatively', 'little', 'film', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'starred', 'flops', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'retreated', 'France', 'made', 'few', 'films', 'had', 'failed', 'attempt', 'tv', 'sitcom', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'films', 'sometimes', 'have', 'modest', 'amount', 'success', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'up', 'occasionally', 'Pirates', 'Silicon', 'Valley', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'made', 'few', 'films', 'starred', 'sitcom', 'Suddenly', 'Susan', 'few', 'years', 'leaving', 'try', 'revive', 'film', 'career']",The Breakfast Club

He's like an icon to many Gen Xers, not necessarily because they all like his films (many don't), but because he was the quinessential 80's teenage comedy man.  But this film is probably the most overrated one he ever did.  I thought it was good when I first saw it, but it's really tame stuff masquerading as edgy, pointed teen angst.  The concept itself could have been interesting (a day's detention with 5 typical high school types, the nerd, the spoiled queen, the druggie, the jock, and the ""alternate"" chick), and it's surprising that Hollywood greenlighted a film with no real plot like this one (Hughes had major pull in those days).  But the execution is really pedestrian.

It does all this with a little innuendo and some foul language (mostly from Bender), but it is ten times cleaner than most teen movies nowadays.  It's respectful while being interesting, and is one of my top ten movies.One thing that impressed me is the way that this film stood up the test of time.

Every time the coming attractions for SIXTEEN CANDLES, WEIRD SCIENCE or PRETTY IN PINK came on before whatever it was I was seeing at my local theater (the nascent days of home video, don't ya know), I wanted to rip Anthony Michael Hall and Molly Ringwald from the screen and drown them in the nearest bathtub. It's bad form to speak ill of the dead, so I'll be charitable and say that Mr. Hughes did humanity a great service by retiring from moviemaking in the mid-Nineties. The worst part is that unlike, say, Ed Wood, Hughes DID have talent...if only he'd applied it more often.That said, THE BREAKFAST CLUB, HOME ALONE  and (arguably) FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF were proof of that talent, even if ultimately they're best appreciated now as curios of that benighted, dim period in American culture. BREAKFAST wears the best for me, because it at least has grounding in a plausible, sympathetic storyline about five teens who spend a Saturday in detention at their local high school and find that a semblance of bonding develops over the course of the day. It is one of the few movies where the aforementioned Hall and Ringwald haven't made me want to go postal, and the others---Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez and Ally Sheedy----more than hold their own. Sheedy is a particular standout as the school ""weirdo"" whofinally lets Ringwald's character----the teen drama queen----pretty her up and be nice to her.

Munson,"[4, 4]","John Hughes, the director of the highly successful ""Sixteen Candles"" has created a masterpiece of a movie that had remained popular for twenty years.  This movie focuses on five high school students who are to spend a Saturday in detention for whatever it was that they did wrong.  At the beginning of the day, they didn't even know each other's names, but by the end, they had bared their souls, explained their dreams, and became friends.Judd Nelson (Bender), Anthony Michael Hall (Brian), Emilio Estevez (Andrew), Molly Ringwald (Claire) and Ally Sheedy (Allison) star as the students, while Paul Gleason stars as principal Richard Vernon.  At 7 am, the students enter the library, not knowing each other, but as the movie progresses, they learn more and more about each other so that by the end of the day, they all realize that there is a little bit of everyone in each of them.  Bender is the ""criminal"", suffering from a bad homelife, abusive parents, and a lack of self-esteem.  Brian is the ""brain"", who believes in studying hard and getting good grades, but he's also a geek.  Andrew is the ""jock"".  He is frustrated because he feels that he must live up to his father's high expectations for him.  He snaps under the pressure that his father placed on him.  Claire is the ""princess"".  She feels that she's better than everyone, and has the best of everything.  Allison is the ""basket case"".  Like Bender, she is suffering from low self-esteem, so she lies to cover up her insecurities.It is amazing to watch the transformation of these characters, especially the relationship between Claire and Bender.  Although he constantly harasses her throughout the movie, deep down Bender really likes and cares for Claire.  As the movie progresses, the characters soon realize that they all have a little of the same characteristics of each other, such as the scene where they are running from Vernon in the halls and Bender asks Claire how it feels to be bad.  Then they display some of Bender's characteristics by sitting and smoking marajuana.There are several funny points in the film as well, such as Bender crashing through the ceiling while telling a joke, and the constant harassment that Vernon faced.  Also, who can forget the great song by Simple Minds?This is a great movie.  The story is excellent and well-developed.  The acting is first-rate, but I thought that Judd Nelson did an especially good job as Bender.  I give this movie a very high recommendation.

Unfortunately, I'm a 17-year-old teenager growing up in the 90's decade, and I'm reduced to watching terrible 90's teen flicks. When people ask me what my favorite teen flick is, I always respond, &quot;The Breakfast Club.&quot; &quot;Isn't that a movie made in the eighties?&quot; &quot;Yes. Compared to 90's teen movies, 80's teen movies win by a landslide.&quot;  This wonderful movie is hilarious. We are treated to a wonderful cast, funny dialogue, and an airtight plot. You all know what the movie is about. What I really love is the characters- we can really see how each character differ from each another, yet they grow to be friends. One of my most favorite things about this movie is the lines they throw at each other. Especially Bender- he had me laughing from start to end!! &quot;I feel empty inside. I admire guys who roll around with other guys.&quot; &quot;I want to be like you. All I need is a lobotomy and some tights.&quot; &quot;Brian, this is a very nutritious lunch. Did your mom marry Mr. Rogers?&quot; &quot;Screws fall out. The world's an imperfect place.&quot; &quot;That's very nice, sir, but what if there's a fire? I think endangering the lives of children would be very unwise at the juncture of your career.&quot;  &quot;Claire?&quot; &quot;It's a family name.&quot; &quot;Yeah, for fat girls.&quot; &quot;I'm not fat.&quot; &quot;Not at present, but you'll be pushing maximum density.&quot; and much more!

Of course back then I really had a huge crush on Molly Ringwald (like a lot of other guys). But almost twenty years later, well......Either this movie hasn't aged well, or like Ally Sheedy said `When you grow up, your heart dies'. I just don't get the emotional connection to this film like I used too, I guess that's because I'm in my thirties now with a kid of my own. It is nostalgic to watch what life was like back in the 80's. I think almost everyone my age misses those days. The movies, the music, the fashions, everything was great. It was a great time to be a teen. This film just isn't realistic anymore, sure you still have the princesses, the jocks, the brains, the basketcases, and the criminals, but the times have changed. These days the John Bender would have physically attacked or shoot the teacher. The basketcase would be sitting at the back table listening to Marilyn Manson instead of looking at a Prince album. The Princess would probably be talking to her friends on a cell-phone. The brain would have found a way to sneak a laptop in and surf the net all day, and the jock would have probably, well I don't know, whatever it is that jocks do these days. I was always a cross between the basketcase, brain, and criminal anyway. Jocks and princesses never made it into my world. Which was the point of the whole movie anyway, breaking barriers.If this was 1985 again, I'd be on Amazon saying this is a 7 star movie and was a feat of human accomplishment. But now in 2003, I have to say I can't sit through this movie again. Maybe one day if I'm feeling nostalgic and have an old girlfriend on my mind I'll pop it in, but that probably won't be for awhile. But on the other hand, I've probably watched this movie a million times already, so I must have thought it was good.This is definitely a movie for teenagers who are trying to find themselves and have the whole world in front of them.

Judd Nelson is absolutely great as the rebellious John Bender who wears grungy clothes and is angry at the injustices his in  his life at home as well as school,Anthony Michael Hall is perfect for the role of the slightly nerdy good guy character , Molly Ringwald's best acting is in this movie though I believe some of the parts in this movie played by her are more than just acting(those are real tears she cries believe me),Ally Sheedy is beautiful both as the irresistible basket case character and as her evolution into the princess image that Claire has and Emilio Esteves is an excellent actor and plays his &quot;sporto&quot; character very convincingly.Even though I could relate to the movie more when I was in high school (especially to the criminal and basket case characters), I still like it a lot.Overall this is a great movie and is never stuck just in one place.I higly recommend it.",4,One of the greatest movies of the 80s is now on DVD.,1080864000,"04 2, 2004",2004,1653,"['great', 'movie.Its', 'still', 'one', 'favorites', 'whole', 'movie', 'are', 'wide', 'range', 'emotions.There', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'funny', 'John', 'Andy', 'Claire', 'Brian', 'smoking', 'pot', 'together', 'times', 'when', 'sad', 'when', 'Andy', 'one', 'darkest', 'secrets', 'anyone', 'can', 'have', 'confesses', 'why', 'did', 'times', 'when', 'rebellious', 'angry', 'would', 'be', 'scene', 'where', 'John', 'what', 'home', 'life', 'times', 'when', 'happy', 'when', 'Allison', 'gorgeous', 'new', 'makeover', 'John', 'Claire', 'finally', 'get', 'other', '.One', 'saddest', 'parts', 'movie', 'when', 'Claire', 'how', 'wont', 'still', 'be', 'friends', 'when', 'go', 'back', 'school', 'Ive', 'seen', 'movie', '15', 'times', 'part', 'still', 'cry', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'absolutely', 'great', 'rebellious', 'John', 'Bender', 'who', 'grungy', 'clothes', 'angry', 'injustices', 'life', 'home', 'as', 'well', 'school', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'perfect', 'role', 'slightly', 'nerdy', 'good', 'guy', 'character', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'best', 'acting', 'movie', 'believe', 'parts', 'movie', 'played', 'are', 'more', 'just', 'acting', 'are', 'real', 'tears', 'believe', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'beautiful', 'irresistible', 'basket', 'case', 'character', 'evolution', 'princess', 'image', 'Claire', 'Emilio', 'Esteves', 'excellent', 'actor', 'quot', 'quot', 'character', 'very', 'convincingly.Even', 'could', 'relate', 'movie', 'more', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'especially', 'criminal', 'basket', 'case', 'characters', 'still', 'lot.Overall', 'great', 'movie', 'never', 'stuck', 'just', 'one', 'place.I', 'higly', 'recommend']",The Breakfast Club

Do they do that anymore???).Anyway, these 5 teens were from COMPLETELY different circles and, although they had seen eachother in the halls, and had heard rumors about eachother, none of them REALLY knew what the others were about.  So, they start off thinking that each one is totally different from them, and so they are each pretty snobby to the others.There's 1 ""tough guy"", 1 ""geek"", 1 ""jock"", 1 ""glamour girl"", and 1 ""weird/loner chick"".  Due to the fact that they all HATED the teacher who was watching over them, they wound up coming together to go against him.  It's during this process that they come to learn about eachother's home & school life - they learn about eachothers hurts, thoughts & fears.  And, through this, they realize that they're not so different after all.So, will they continue to be friends after this day of in-school suspension is over?  I don't want to ruin it for you in case you've never seen it, but suffice it to say that you'll probably never forget the ending to ""The Breakfast Club"" - I don't know of anyone who has - even 20 years later...Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys teenage-type movies - it makes as much sense today as it did 20 years ago (only the styles have changed).

57019,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,078322687X,L.A. Scene,"[8, 9]","In the mid 1980s, a group of young actors and actresses called ""The Brat Pack"" would emerge.  Different members of this group would appear in films together.  These roles would range from high school teenagers to young adults.  At the same time, a young writer, producer, and director named John Hughes was beginning to make a name for himself with such movies as ""Mr. Mom"", ""Vacation"", ""European Vacation"", and ""Weird Science"".  The combination of John Hughes and The Brat Pack would come together for the 1985 movie ""The Breakfast Club"".  What would be an inexpensive movie would not only become a surprise hit, but one that would stand the test of time for two decades.  The reason for this movie standing the test of time is that it is a movie that both teenagers and adults who were once teenagers could relate to.The plot of this movie is very simple.  The story of this film takes place over an 8 hour period on March 24, 1984 at the fictional Shermer High School in the fictional Chicago suburb of Shermer Illinois.  If you have followed John Hughes' films, you will know that Shermer Illinois has been used in several of his movies (examples include ""Weird Science"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", and ""Sixteen Candles"").  It is on that date that 5 High School students, each from different backgrounds come together for a detention session.  When the detention session starts; Richard Vernon (played by Paul Gleason) the teacher in charge tells the 5 students to write a 1000 word essay explaining ""who they think they are"".  As the detention session begins, the students are quiet, but then the obvious frictions that come from the different backgrounds of each of the students soon will surface.  However it is from those frictions that each of the students will soon get to know each other, and some bonding begins to surface.  The students will soon realize they have similar problems when it comes to peer pressure and home life.It is the five members that come from the Brat Pack that give the film its charm:  Emilio Estevez as Andrew, the high school jock;  Anthony Michael Hall as Brian,  the brainy nerd;  Molly Ringwald as Claire the preppy 'princess';  Ally Sheedy as Allison, the psycho ""basket case""; and Judd Nelson as John Bender, as the troublemaker.  In particular it is Judd Nelson's performance as Bender that really stands out.  Perhaps because ""The Breakfast Club"" was both a John Hughes and Brat Pack movie is why this performance was overlooked.  Nelson's performance was outstanding and probably even warranted some Oscar consideration.  Looking back at the film some 20 years later, you really see what a great performance it is.  Bender also provides some of the film's lighter moments - in particular when he squares off with Vernon.  However it is also Bender that really breaks the ice in the film.  It is actually a result of Bender's sarcasm that the dialogue begins between the five students.  At first, the other four do not like Bender (and vice versa), but as the bonding begins in the film, it is interesting to see how Bender will take the blame for some mischief by the group - as well as the group covering for Bender's antics.There are other outstanding performances in this movie as well.  Molly Ringwald is very believable in her role as the preppy as is Anthony Michael Hall as the nerd.  Next to Nelson's performance, it is probably Ally Sheedy's role as Allison the ""basket case"" that stands out.  Allison is a strange character - one who is very quiet at the beginning.  Therefore the character of Allison is going to have to rely more on physical motion.  Sheedy pulls this off brilliantly.  Estevez also does a good job playing the jock - the scene that he explains why he is in detention is outstanding.While this film does a great job at a character study among the five students, this film does a character study from the adult perspective - namely around the character of Richard Vernon.  This comes in a scene with Carl the Janitor.  We get some insight into why Vernon got into teaching, and how things didn't go the way they expected.  While Carl might only be a janitor, he provides Vernon with a lot of insight into himself.One thing that John Hughes does very well is integrate music into the movie.  While the music takes a secondary role to the story, the music is used at the right time with the right scene.  Keith Forsey, a producer who works with Billy Idol was in charge of the music with this song.  ""The Breakfast Club"" would feature the monster-hit by Simple Minds called ""Don't You (Forget About Me"") (This song would launch Simple Minds' career in the United States).  The instrumentation of this song is simply brilliant.  Listen to how the drum beats and keyboards play perfectly in the movie.  Another great song that didn't get nearly as much attention was Karla DeVito's ""We Are Not Alone"".  This song is used during a ""rebellious"" scene in the movie - and it fits perfect.One scene that happens toward the end of the movie is when Hall's character of Brian asks the question ""Will we all be friends when we go to school on Monday?""  This scene is crafted so well by Hughes - and it's a scene that any teenager or former teenager has been exposed to.  In a way, that scene is almost a symbol of the entire movie.Overall, this is a movie that I find myself watching over and over.  Each successive time I watch it, I find something new.  In a way, I would have loved to have seen an official sequel to see what happens when they all get back to school.  This is a movie I highly recommend.",5,A Masterful Character Study for young and old,1125187200,"08 28, 2005",2005,5571,"['mid', '1980s', 'group', 'young', 'actors', 'actresses', 'called', 'Brat',

57020,A1JG9920BAIQTD,078322687X,Lauren,"[10, 10]","Some question the durability of &quot;The Breakfast Club,&quot; saying that the themes and plotlines do not hold up in today's teen society. As a 15-year-old, I would like to say that that is thoroughly untrue. 19 years after its release, &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; is still a truthful, relateable account of teenagers and their personalities, and the ways in which they interact with each other. Sure, the stereotypes of the characters may be a bit exaggerated -- but that's necessary in order to get the point across. Watching this movie, I feel as if I know these people, or at least I've run across them at one point in my high school career.The plot, as most people know, involves five different kids being assigned Saturday detention together. Each kid represents a typical high school stereotype -- a princess (Molly Ringwald), a jock (Emilio Estevez), a brain (Anthony Michael Hall), a basket case (the excellent Ally Sheedy), and a criminal (Judd Nelson). At the beginning of the day, none of them know each other, except for the princess and the jock. Throughout the day, they learn more about each other and work at tearing down the stereotypes that pit them against each other. As for the reviewer who said this isn't realistic that they would open up so much to each other -- it absolutely is. Put five kids into a room without an adult for nine hours, and they will talk about anything.The beauty of this movie is the depth of the characters beyond the stereotypes -- particularly the nerd, Brian, who as we find out in the movie has problems well beyond what people think of him. He is the one that I most relate to in the movie. Watch &quot;The Breakfast Club,&quot; and see who you most relate to. It's a great experience. Beyond the social commentary aspect, it's also just a funny movie. The jokes come at breakneck speed, especially for the first half of the movie (before it gets somewhat serious). The actors are also very enjoyable in their roles, particularly Ally Sheedy and Anthony Michael Hall.

57026,A2VG8F8TL6AYDR,078322687X,"""lexo-2""","[5, 7]","Ahh, this movie.  Oh, dear.This film was released at a time when I was especially susceptible to it; I was 15 in 1985 and was smack in the middle of the target market.  I must have seen it at least half a dozen times since, and while my admiration for the craft of it has grown, my perception of what the film actually _does_ has sharpened and become more caustic.In brief, Hughes starts with a superb premise and proceeds to systematically fudge it, rather than threaten the commercial appeal of the film.  Watching it now, it starts soooo promisingly, with John Bender (Judd Nelson, excellent) in full bulging-eyed effect as the potential Lord of Misrule in this teenage purgatory.  He is rude, obnoxious, and genuinely threatening as the quasi-berserk working-class loser.  Over the course of the story, the various denizens of detention learn to overcome the prejudices they have about each other, and leave the building as a supposedly coherent bunch of Human Beings.This is the bit that I find implausible.  There were John Benders in my school, and they were this frightening, almost this intelligent, but no way were they this vulnerable.  (In case you haven't guessed already, I am represented here by the Anthony Michael Hall character - the studious nerd - except that I wasn't that studious and no way did I do so well academically.)  It was necessary for Hughes to flatter his largely teenage market by promoting a dream of solidarity - teens against the oldsters! - that simply didn't exist in the mid-Eighties.  Hughes does manage to capture the utter distrust and dislike of authority amongst these kids; they defend Bender from the unpleasant teacher, even though they don't like him, and that much is accurate.  (Trivia note: Paul Gleason, the classic 80s rentavillain, he did exactly the same hardass mo-fo schtick in Trading Places, is great as the teacher, who happens to be called Richard Vernon - I'm guessing, after the veteran UK actor Richard Vernon, who played the elderly square in the train compartment in the first reel of the first Beatles' movie &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;.  Teen revolt intertextuality.  Somebody follow this up, please.)This could have been a seriously radical (in every sense of the word) film if the other kids had turned on the Nelson character and torn him to shreds.  Instead, he gets the prom queen and even gets to stick her diamond earring in his lobe.  Of course, the film I dream of would never have been made.Still, it was something of a pleasant shock, when you were 15, to find your most subversive sentiments being aired in a Hollywood movie, even if the film ignored, glossed over or otherwise fudged them in the wind-up.

57034,AWWY3JYKYJIOS,078322687X,MagicSinglez,"[5, 6]","Breakfast Club is one of the most beloved movies. All the action takes place pretty much in one room. The 'action' consists of kids talking to each other. I've seen the Breakfast Club many times over the years - if the movie were playing right now - I could mouth along and do the lines of each character.I notice completely different things about this movie over time. Maybe we look at the world around us based upon the previous information we've been given. We've been informed that being a victim doesn't make one timid, but the opposite, tough, or pious. In a world where everyone 'reaches to grab the lowest rung of the ladder' (the lowest rung of the victim ladder) I think the focus of this movie is on John (stereotyped as the criminal). John's a bad-boy. His family is poor. He's abused at home by his dad. At one point in the movie Claire (the princess) says of John, ""Just ignore him"". John replies, ""You couldn't ignore me if you tried""When I think about this movie today I notice more how Brian (the nerd) is the true 'victim' here (of course the movie is trying to make a point that they are all victims). Brian doesn't get the girl. John and Andy (the jock) often treat Brian as completely irrelevant. Even the school principle, caught up in events, refers to Brian as 'peewee' a couple of times.It only took me 20 years to notice, and, I'm a nerd myself. A society obsessed with victimhood should at least get right who the victims are.The song that went with the movie was, 'Don't You Forget About Me' by Simple Minds. I think, in the end, I always remember Brian - the other kids asking him to do their assignments; in a sense, asking Brian to speak up for them - Claire saying, 'We trust you'. Guess they need the nerd guy after all.",5,When I think about this movie today I notice more how Brian (the nerd) is the true 'victim' here,1170374400,"02 2, 2007",2007,1753,"['Breakfast', 'Club', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'movies', 'action', 'place', 'pretty', 'much', 'one', 'room', ""'action"", 'consists', 'kids', 'talking', 'other', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'many', 'times', 'years', 'movie', 'were', 'playing', 'right', 'now', 'could', 'mouth', 'along', 'do', 'lines', 'character.I', 'notice', 'completely', 'different', 'things', 'movie', 'time', 'Maybe', 'look', 'world', 'based', 'previous', 'information', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', ""'ve"", 'been', 'informed', 'being', 'victim', ""n't"", 'make', 'one', 'timid', 'opposite', 'tough', 'pious', 'world', 'where', 'everyone', 'grab', 'lowest', 'rung', 'ladder', 'lowest', 'rung', 'victim', 'ladder', 'think', 'focus', 'movie', 'John', 'stereotyped', 'criminal', 'John', 'bad-boy', 'family', 'poor', 'abused', 'home', 'dad', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'Claire', 'princess', 'John', 'Just', 'ignore', 'John', 'replies', 'could', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'tried', 'When', 'think', 'movie', 'today', 'notice', 'more', 'how', 'Brian', 'nerd', 'true', ""'victim"", 'here', 'course', 'movie', 'trying', 'make', 'point', 'are', 'victims', 'Brian', ""n't"", 'get', 'girl', 'John', 'Andy', 'jock', 'often', 'treat', 'Brian', 'completely', 'irrelevant', 'Even', 'school', 'principle', 'caught', 'up', 'events', 'refers', 'Brian', ""'peewee"", 'couple', 'times.It', 'only', 'took', '20', 'years', 'notice', ""'m"", 'nerd', 'society', 'obsessed', 'victimhood', 'should', 'least', 'get', 'right', 'who', 'victims', 'are.The', 'song', 'went', 'movie', 'was', ""'Do"", ""n't"", 'Forget', 'Me', 'Simple', 'Minds', 'think', 'end', 'always', 'remember', 'Brian', 'other', 'kids', 'asking', 'do', 'assignments', 'sense', 'asking', 'Brian', 'speak', 'up', 'Claire', 'saying', 'trust', 'need', 'nerd', 'guy']",The Breakfast Club

I'll note i purchased this at wal-mart because its actually cheaper!!??!?!?!? than amazon... i picked it up for $11.99 which is a legit steal for everything provided...Packaging: Nothing special... standard blu-ray affair with a cardboard cover overlay... I will note that the permanent plastic under the overlay that protects the cover-insert is horridly warped with a ripple effect... may bother hardcore people but... there really should be a higher end version of this movie for those people anyway...Contents: Good stuff here... this is in fact TWO discs... not like some of the old-school HD DVD/DVD Combos... there is a full fledged DVD movie and a full fledged Blu-ray Disc... PERFECT!!!! it may just be an annoyance to me but I hate double sided discs for many many reasons...DA BLU-RAY (AKA Why you're here!!!) :Quality to me is impeccable... I think some people forget how old these classics are... we're talking about resurrecting film that is ages old and expecting it to be Avatar (or whatever) quality... I am actually STUNNED by how good this blu-ray transfer looks... it really is GOOD... I'm watching it right now on a 55"" DLP 1080p with my PS3 and 7.1 - and no I'm not bragging or anything, just stating for peoples own reference - and in my opinion its pretty excellent... ZERO complaints here... the video looks great... the audio is in line and on par... this isn't Sound of Music or Fiddler... so audio-wise it can be hard to say one way or another as long as the lines sync up with the lips... and they do...DVD : who cares... it'll be dvd quality, which is GREAT, dont get me wrong... it's just icing on the cake imoDigital Content : not rated... sorry I just dont use digital movies that much... yet... but I will definitely utilize it once it's a bit more viable and necessary...The Movie : Uhm... go awayCONCLUSION : WORTH THE MONEY... still completely stunned that wal-mart beat out amazon on the price... a bit angered I paid taxes on it... but 11.99 + tax is cheaper than the current amazon price...Anyway...

Notwithstanding its cinematic merits (working with a tiny budget, writer-director  John Hughes gets some nice performances out of his cast) it struck me as pure fairy tale. If I'd seen it when I was younger, maybe some combination of my desire to believe in it and my angst-ridden sympathy with the characters would have made me love it. But at my age, I didn't. I still love Hughes's ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" because it does not strive to be more than the charming frothy fantasy it is. ""The Breakfast Club,"" despite a few jokes at the expense of the vice principal ""supervising"" the detention, takes itself way too seriously.You have high-school types: a quirkily attractive delinquent stoner (Judd Nelson), a conventionally good-looking athlete (Emilio Estevez), an affluent pink prom princess (Molly Ringwald), a straight-A nerd (Anthony Michael Hall) and a misfit (Ally Sheedy). They all do a Saturday of detention together. Initially they dislike each other, but having nothing to do to alleviate their boredom other than talk to each other, they come to realize that each of them is more than a type as they bare their souls about their problems with school, their parents, sexuality and their cliques (or lack of a clique in Sheedy's case). They get high. By mid-afternoon, Hall's character says he now considers them all friends. Ringwald's character disagrees, certain that even though they may have bonded during their day of detention, on Monday morning, they'll be back with their cliques and ignoring each other in the halls.By the end of the movie, Ringwald's character makes over Sheedy's character and turns her from a black-clad, black-eyelinered pre-goth to another pink princess and Estevez's wrestler is in love with Sheedy. Virginal Ringwald is in love with delinquent stoner Nelson and plans to date him to get even with her parents. Hall gets over not getting an A in shop class.I was some combination of Hall and Sheedy's characters. Occasionally in high school I would be thrown in to a situation where I was alone with a girl like Ringwald's character or a guy like Nelson or Estevez's characters and have what I thought was a profound conversation that meant we could be friends, only to find that Ringwald's character was right: Within a couple of days, they stopped seeing or hearing me when I tried to say hello in the halls.I know I'm in the minority, and maybe I'm just bitter, but I thought ""The Breakfast Club"" was selling a lie and not selling it at all convincingly.",2,Truly a Movie for Teens,1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,2646,"['SPOILER', 'ALERTEither', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'old', 'see', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'never', 'fully', 'recovered', 'being', 'high', 'school', 'outcast', 'Notwithstanding', 'cinematic', 'merits', 'working', 'tiny', 'budget', 'writer-director', 'John', 'Hughes', 'nice', 'performances', 'cast', 'struck', 'pure', 'fairy', 'tale', ""'d"", 'seen', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'maybe', 'combination', 'desire', 'believe', 'angst-ridden', 'sympathy', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'love', 'age', 'did', ""n't"", 'still', 'love', 'Hughes', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Day', 'Off', 'not', 'strive', 'be', 'more', 'charming', 'frothy', 'fantasy', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'few', 'jokes', 'expense', 'vice', 'principal', 'supervising', 'detention', 'way', 'too', 'seriously.You', 'have', 'high-school', 'types', 'quirkily', 'attractive', 'delinquent', 'stoner', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'conventionally', 'good-looking', 'athlete', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'affluent', 'pink', 'prom', 'princess', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'straight-A', 'nerd', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'misfit', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'do', 'Saturday', 'detention', 'together', 'Initially', 'dislike', 'other', 'having', 'nothing', 'do', 'alleviate', 'boredom', 'other', 'talk', 'other', 'come', 'realize', 'more', 'type', 'bare', 'souls', 'problems', 'school', 'parents', 'sexuality', 'cliques', 'lack', 'clique', 'Sheedy', 'case', 'get', 'high', 'mid-afternoon', 'Hall', 'character', 'now', 'friends', 'Ringwald', 'character', 'disagrees', 'certain', 'even', 'may', 'have', 'bonded', 'day', 'detention', 'Monday', 'morning', ""'ll"", 'be', 'back', 'cliques', 'ignoring', 'other', 'halls.By', 'end', 'movie', 'Ringwald', 'character', 'over', 'Sheedy', 'character', 'black-clad', 'black-eyelinered', 'pre-goth', 'pink', 'princess', 'Estevez', 'wrestler', 'love', 'Sheedy', 'Virginal', 'Ringwald', 'love', 'delinquent', 'stoner', 'Nelson', 'plans', 'date', 'get', 'even', 'parents', 'Hall', 'not', 'getting', 'A', 'shop', 'class.I', 'was', 'combination', 'Hall', 'Sheedy', 'characters', 'Occasionally', 'high', 'school', 'would', 'be', 'thrown', 'situation', 'where', 'was', 'alone', 'girl', 'Ringwald', 'character', 'guy', 'Nelson', 'Estevez', 'characters', 'have', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'profound', 'conversation', 'meant', 'could', 'be', 'friends', 'only', 'find', 'Ringwald', 'character', 'was', 'right', 'couple', 'days', 'stopped', 'seeing', 'hearing', 'when', 'tried', 'say', 'hello', 'halls.I', 'know', ""'m"", 'minority', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'bitter', 'thought', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'was', 'selling', 'lie', 'not', 'selling', 'convincingly']",The Breakfast Club

They play five high school students who have to give up half of their weekend to spend a Saturday detention at their school. The characters have nothing in common and obviously don't know each other when they get together for the detention, but they surely get to know each other quite a bit. Paul Gleason (who passed away last year, played Mr. Vernon, the principal) is great as well. When Mr. Vernon leaves the room, you can just imagine what goes on amongst the five students during their detention. I first saw this movie years ago on the Encore channel back in the 90s, and thought it was so cool and funny as well. The soundtrack to the film is excellent too, including the Simple Minds song Don't You (Forget About Me). The sound and picture quality are excellent too. However, there are no extras on this DVD, such as interviews with the actors, director, or behind the scenes footage. That is kind of a bummer, but the movie is still worth watching anyway.

But ""Breakfast Club"" is about six times better than ""The Big Chill"" (which was a John Sayles ripoff anyway) because it gave us characters who mattered, characters who represented a type but transcended all traps of cliche and stereotype to become real live human beings.Watch the film today, and listen to the beautifully realized dialogue. How did he know? How did John Hughes know that this was how we talked, this is what went on, these were the genuine problems we faced? John wasn't afraid of confronting cliches (the prom queen's divorced parents try to buy her love, the tough kid is abused by his alcoholic dad, etc.) because he knew that for millions of us, those cliches were real, and the fact that our problems weren't even original hurt us all the more. And he delivered all this in an enormously entertaining package, with genuine laughs and killer attitude.I'm not sure the actors were ever as strong as they were in ""Breakfast Club."" Some of them floundered for years shortly after this was released. But man, did they ever figure these characters out to the BONE. Emilio Estevez' performance is more and more impressive with every viewing...his character has the least flash, but he might be the deepest, since he only barely understands how badly he's been hurt by his father's drive. But they ALL nailed their characters. It must have been incredible to be a part of this movie...watching it today brings back those memories like a flood.Is ""Breakfast Club"" still relevant today?

So I can't identify with this movie at all. Especially an American detention. They were there the whole of Saturday! And the antics they get up to!I got recommended this by someone I work with, who was playing the Simple Minds on her mp3 player, and I confessed I had no idea who they were. She said they did a song on the soundtrack to this, I said I'd never seen it, and she told me to get it. So I did.None of the actors have really done much since this film, apart from Emilio Estevez, who is still floating around out there. There's been lots of fuss about a sequel, but I doubt that will ever happen. It doesn't really warrant a sequel. Which means they will make a sequel or a remake. And that will ruin it.Basically you have five teenage stereotypes - the rebel (Bender), the princess (Claire), the jock (Andy), the brain (Brian), and the outcast (Allison) - who would never normally associate with each other, but they get stuck together in detention. It can be a bit overacted, and a bit melodramatic at times, but yes, it works. My favourite character was the outcast, Allison, played by Ally Sheedy. She actually reminded me quite a lot of myself during high school (and at the beginning of college), hiding behind her fringe, coat, whatever comes to hand, and not speaking to anyone. Her haircut was practically the same as mine too! And the dandruff/snow on the drawing scene was absolutely classic! The reasons they all get into detention are a bit strange as well: Bender: pulls a false fire alarm; Brian: flare gun goes off in his locker; Andy: tapes a guy's butt cheeks together in the locker room; Claire: ditches class to go shopping; and Allison: didn't do anything, she didn't have anything better to do on a Saturday. (That last bit made the character for me.)The rest of the movie is pretty much forgettable, apart from the dancing sequence, which is so funny.If you recognise yourself in these characters, or know someone else who was that particular stereotype, then I would recommend getting it. It's easy enough to while away an hour or so watching. It will also show what you're really like depending which character is your favourite. What does your favourite reveal about you? It's a shame I'm not old enough to remember the 80s (ha!) I was born halfway through, and wasn't old enough to know about the whole Rat Pack phenomenon.

John Hughes is not only known for writing gag movies like ""Weird Science"" and ""National Lampoon's Vacation,"" but he's famous for his journeys into the teenage psyche.  He knows how teenagers talk (or at least how they talked in 1985) and the kinds of pressures they deal with.John Bender (a brilliant Judd Nelson) is the badass.  His abusive past gives him a rough exterior but a fragile interior. Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall) is the geek, dying to belong with the popular crowd but committed to being smart.  Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), the prom queen every girl hated in high school, becomes aware of her own snobbery and learns how much she hurts others by being spoiled.  Emilio Estevez plays jock Andrew Clark who tries to please his old man by always being a winner.  Finally, Ally Sheedy does a wonderful job playing Allison Reynolds, a crazy outsider who just wants someone to pay attention to her.The language is raw, the emotions are real, and the camaraderie between the characters is one of those bonds that is never forgotten.  They learn that they have some things in common, most obviously a hatred for the principal and the school system.  If you are an adult, watch this film to remember what being young was like.

That's what happens to five high school students who are forced to spend a Saturday detention together.  None of them have anything in common and none of them are friends.  Each is an opposite from the other.  The group consists of a brain, a prom queen, a jock, a basket case and a trouble-maker.  A unique and unexpected bond is formed by the five teens as the day goes on, with all sorts of different states of emotion going on for each of them.  No matter happens on Monday, all five of them will always that one Saturday together; therefore, forever labeling them &quot;The Breakfast Club.&quot;Not only is this a classic film, it's one of my personal favorites.  I loved it when I was little and I love it now as I am in my twenties.  It's so refreshing to have a brutally honest film that plays on all of your emotions as this movie does.  And even though this was shot in the eighties, people can still relate to it now in 2000.  This is why it is so effective and powerful.The movie is so memorable that you will most likely repeat every single line during each viewing.  The actors do a terrific job of portraying their roles flawlessly.  The script is funny and touching at the same time.  Everything that is shown in the movie is crucial and significant; being that there isn't a single minute in the movie that goes wasted.This new DVD edition, while it may not be the most spectacular of DVDs, is a lot better than the previous version.  They did an excellent job of producing a successful remastered version of the movie that looks and sounds excellent.  You can even watch it in DTS; that is, if your system carries it.  I'm afraid there's not much to offer in the special features department.  It really is a shame, being that this is such a classic movie.  Still, the way the film looks and sounds is worth the price alone.&quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; is a terrific movie that still has the same effect on us as it did years and years ago.

57067,A3D732EQ36IHO8,078322687X,"Mo ""Grim Reaper""","[0, 4]","I'm not going to give this film a one-star ""aweful"" review, but it's bad. The lines are really cheesy and the writers made the assistant principal a sucker, which took away from the realism and credibility of the movie. Start with the cheese. Pick any random moment and you're guaranteed to find some of the corniest and most predictable and unsophisticated dialogue that one can fathom. An example of this cheesiness is when there are three people in the room: Bender, Brian and Claire and Bender said a few lines about Claire, teasing yer, and she said something like, ""stop making fun of me."" What the hell are you, 7? In the real world, high school girls like Claire wouldn't pay douchebags like this any attention at all, let alone be that vulnerable with a background like hers to somebody like him.Another cheesy line is when Bender and the assistant principal have a heated exchange when Bender tells him to ""eat my shorts"" (which I initially thought originated from ""The Simpsons"") and ""Dick"" (the assistant principal) gives him extra Saturdays of detention for being an ass. Dick then asks him, ""you through?!"" and this supposed ""rebel"" says something as corny in rebuttal as, ""not-even-close, bud."" Haha. Hello, Pizza Hut, can I have some extra Breakfast Club cheese with my pizza?They even have them all whistling to ""Colonel Bogey March."" Why would they have this supposed ""cool"" guy who ridicules other characters like Brian for being a dork all of a sudden have him whistling this song for squares? And why would the other characters who've found the guy (Bender) obnoxious for being a (four letter word that rhymes with stick), all of a sudden join in, in whistling the song with him?Another part of the film that took away from the movie was the writers' writing of the school assistant principal as an unrealistic and far-fetched character. They write him as a sucker where it's as if he purposely and intentionally finds ways to be at a distance from the students so that they could act in mischievous manners. This guy's roaming in the halls more so than even the students. He's checking his reflection in the glass, singing, dancing. No principal or teacher does this, especially when he's upset at having to come in on a Saturday to deal with these obnoxious kids.Bender trolls this guy, and all this school assistant principal can do is stand there and take it and say ""one more, one more"" (meaning Bender stays one extra Saturday for trolling him). That was one of the film's lowest moments. Meanwhile, you have Andrew Clark (Estevez's character) who not only doesn't rebel against or provoke Dick, but even does what he tells him to do (like moving a shelf to keep the door open after Bender takes the screws out from the door), and when the assistant principal isn't satisfied with the results he turns up on Andrew in a way that he doesn't with the guy who's been provoking and insulting him the most (Bender). It becomes unfair and hard to invest emotionally in. The writers play the assistant principal like a sucker. You know Bender took the screws from the door based on his reputation and his behavior with you, so why the hell is he acting like he didn't know who it was? ""Why is that door closed?! Why?! Who closed that door?!"" YOU KNOW WHO DID IT! He even says later on, ""you're not fooling anybody Bender. The next screw that falls out is gonna be you."" Then why didn't you confront Bender and do something about it? It kills the credibility of the movie. It becomes difficult to take it seriously. To make me invest in Dick's character as an assistant principal, I'm supposed to believe that he has the power to make Bender's life hell by punishing him for his actions, but he doesn't have any of that.People touched on this. It's obvious why this film received the amount of high praise that it did, it's because people watched this growing up and had fond memories of watching a movie that they thought was cool back in 1985 or on VHS, and a movie that they identified with being of that age group/demographic at the time. So they find it difficult to cope with the reality that this film is 1) overrated, 2) cheesy and 3) has a critical dumbed-down cast member (assistant principal).

They are an unusual mix of people (a Weirdo, a Delinqent, a Nerd, a Princess, and a Jock) all put together in one room for a day.  Here they are forced to look at each other which contemplating their detention assignment - writing an essay about what makes them them.  This was obviously meant to punish, but turns them into talking about themselves in ways they otherwise wouldn't and the play unfolds.It was odd to see Molly Ringwald here as the snotty popular girl when she is perhaps more famous for being the outcast.  Here she will only speak to the Jock as she considers him to be her equal and not the others until the Delinquent Judd Nelson bullies his way into cracking her shell.  And eating sushi for lunch with chopsticks?  That's a little strange.  Ally Sheedy, however, stole this movie in my opinion.  She is the sullen, twitching creep in the back.  The sandwich!  Who can forget that?!  And using her own dandruff on the drawing of the snowy day!  And we find out she wasn't in detention, she just didn't have anything else to do that day!!!  HA!  Anthony Michael Hall reappeared as the drooling Nerd once again, but he was probably the most dangerous of them all as he was in detention for bringing a gun to school.  And the Jock, Emilio Estevez, which is a sort of bad guy is actually pretty likable.Why not 5 stars?  Judd Nelson.  Judd Nelson as the Delinquent was just exactly that.  He was annoying, obnoxious, insecure, and proved nothing except that his bad behavior earned him the next six months of detention Saturdays.  He was a rebel without  a clue.

This movie could have been set anywhere and in any decade and it would still tell the same story, only fashion and accessories would be different. Everyone has seen this movie by now and everyone has an opinion on it and most will say it is a really good movie. I would say that it deserves to be called a classic by now. It may not be a laugh out loud comedy or very dramatic and does move a little slow at times, but it delivers its message loud and clear and keeps you engaged throughout the whole movie. It gains momentum as it moves along and by the end, after experiencing all the emotiions you will feel satisfied.Being a small cast, all your attention is focused on the individual characters. The 5 students are all completely different from one another and all are brilliant. Each actor plays their part perfectly. While there is a large age gap between them they are all convincing as teenagers fighting there own demons. They will all probably be most remembered for this movie, with the exception of Emilio Estevez, but special mention must go to Judd Nelson who I believe is the biggest star of the film. His part was originally intended for either Nicholas Cage or John Cusack who would have also been great, but I'm glad Judd got his chance to prove his acting capabilities.It is a shame the DVD lacks many special features. All you get is a trailer and cast bios, I was desperately seeking an audio commentary, or at the very least production notes, however there are some interesting facts noted on IMDB.A teen movie for the 80's generation, anyone born after the film was made will probably not like it, but for others who grew up around or just after it will probably agree this movie is indeed a classic.7.5/10",4,Classic in its own right,1161216000,"10 19, 2006",2006,1875,"['dont', 'know', 'what', 'like', 'have', 'gone', 'school', '1980', 'have', 'gone', 'school', 'United', 'States', 'can', 'still', 'relate', 'movie', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'anywhere', 'decade', 'would', 'still', 'tell', 'same', 'story', 'only', 'fashion', 'accessories', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'Everyone', 'seen', 'movie', 'now', 'everyone', 'opinion', 'most', 'will', 'say', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'be', 'called', 'classic', 'now', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'comedy', 'very', 'dramatic', 'move', 'little', 'slow', 'times', 'message', 'loud', 'clear', 'engaged', 'whole', 'movie', 'gains', 'momentum', 'along', 'end', 'experiencing', 'emotiions', 'will', 'feel', 'satisfied.Being', 'small', 'cast', 'attention', 'focused', 'individual', 'characters', '5', 'students', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'one', 'are', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'part', 'perfectly', 'large', 'age', 'gap', 'are', 'convincing', 'teenagers', 'fighting', 'there', 'own', 'demons', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'most', 'remembered', 'movie', 'exception', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'special', 'mention', 'must', 'go', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'who', 'believe', 'biggest', 'star', 'film', 'part', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'John', 'Cusack', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'great', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Judd', 'got', 'chance', 'prove', 'acting', 'capabilities.It', 'shame', 'DVD', 'many', 'special', 'features', 'get', 'trailer', 'cast', 'bios', 'was', 'desperately', 'seeking', 'audio', 'commentary', 'very', 'least', 'production', 'notes', 'however', 'are', 'interesting', 'facts', 'noted', 'IMDB.A', 'teen', 'movie', '80', 'generation', 'anyone', 'born', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'others', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'just', 'will', 'probably', 'agree', 'movie', 'indeed', 'classic.7.5/10']",The Breakfast Club

The plot (for those not already familiar with it) revolves around 5 teenagers from various walks of life, forced to sit together through one Saturday afternoon detension session. A hilarious, well-crafted and often poignant film about the fundemental truths that make us all human, John Hughes &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; is perhaps the single greatest exploration of the angst and confusion that plagued us all during the high school years.UNIVERSAL's remastering efforts on this DVD provide some angst of their own. Despite being anamorphically enhanced for 16X9 displays, this newly minted DVD offers nothing in the way of video improvement over the previously issued DVD.  Colors are dated, unrealistic, often unbalanced with some bleeding and smearing.  Fine detail is minimal, even in well lit scenes.  Contrast, shadow and black levels are all extremely weak. Age related artifacts, including chips, scratches and spice jump cuts are all evident. There is a considerable amount of film grain present throughout for a wholly unsatisfying visual presentation.  The audio - remixed to 5.1 in both Dolby and DTS exhibits a dated characteristic with muffled dialogue and practically no spacial separation, except in the music tracks.EXTRAS: A Theatrical trailer that is badly worn.BOTTOM LINE: &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; is a brilliant movie.

You have in the simplest terms and most convenient definitions a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal. Everyone one of us can relate to one of these characters (personally, I was the basket case). You have snappy dialogue, a very uncool and intolerant authority figure, in the guise of Paul Gleason, demonstrating the generation gap perfectly.

57087,AHZC8S3OHOBVU,078322687X,"Norton833 ""Norton833""","[9, 27]","This is just one of the most overrated films of all time.  Probably because of the emotional investment so many of its fans have in it, as they saw it when they were teenagers, or, just as likely, pre-teenagers.  But even older critics seemed to have suspended their judgment.Despite having been made in, and so heavily identified with, the 80's, Breakfast Club is firmly rooted in the pop psychology movement of the late 60's/early 70's.  Much of the ""action"" In the film consists of the eponymous ""club""  sitting in a circle and trying to ""break down"" each other's ""walls"" (in the parlance of the times), a trope directly lifted from the 70's pop psychology Encounter Group therapy session of the type seen in films like ""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice"".  A lot of these scenes are right out of the rule book of the infamous Synanon House of the period, where the ""encounter"" style was far more aggressive, and could turn into an attack on a single person.  This happens a lot in Breakfast Club, to each of the characters.  Most of this psychological terror is carried out by the school bully, Bender, played by then-25-year-old Judd Nelson, who incessantly harasses most of the other kids in room, who are there involuntarily, (for detention).  The only ""kid"" (actually a 25-year old Emilio Estevez playing a kid) to hold his own against him is Andy, ""the jock"".  There's also ""the nerd"", played to the hilt by Anthony Michael Hall, and ""the prom queen"", played by Molly Ringwald, ( about two years away from throwing her career right down the dustbin of history ).  Ally Sheedy plays ""the loner"".In the weird logic of Hollywood, all of this abuse just makes the kids love Bender more.  Similarly, at other points in Breakfast Club we are repeatedly expected to feel sympathy not for the victims of abuse, but for their tormentors, not only in Bender's bullying actions, but in the Estevez character's whining, self-pitying (and, I might add, seemingly endless) monologue about committing some freakishly creepy sexual abuse on some poor kid.  Apparently, it really hurts to bully people.  The film industry, largely made up of people with Leftist tendencies, often asks us to sympathize with bullies and criminal perps, a couple of the most egregious examples being the bleeding-heart hand wringer Dead Man Walking and the South African film Tsotsi.The ""encounter sessions"" in Breakfast Club are interspersed with small, generally non-sequitir vignettes of 50's-style teen rebellion, e.g., the crazy, spontaneous dance scene, backed by a soundtrack that was already dated back in 1985.  This little sequence gives the movie its biggest WTF moment, when Estevez lets out a leonine roar, and suddenly a plate glass window shatters ( It plays like some weird fusion of Heroes, Dune,  and Footloose ).  So disjointed is this film that it seems as if several different writers were working on different parts of the movie, and when they were done writing, they just sort of patched it all together in random order.Worst of all is the way the film resolves itself, as, for no apparent reason, four out of the five kids pair up (guess who gets left out?  Bingo!  ""The Nerd""!  How's that for a depressing message for at least a portion of the audience in a film that fancies itself ""uplifting""?)

57089,A1EAAH5UM5P8SB,078322687X,"oldpink ""Dark Side of the Moon""","[3, 3]","It was a real pleasure watching this movie once again, twenty-five years after I originally saw it, while I myself was still in high school.Say what you will about the late John Hughes, this particular movie somehow captured what it is to be a young person in a way that few others ever did or ever will.This movie is centered around seven people:The late Paul Gleason, as school principal and antagonist, Richard Vernon.John Kapelos, as the surprisingly funny and canny janitor, Carl.Anthony Michael Hall, as Brian Johnson, the smart, somewhat nerdy kid.Emilio Estevez, as Andrew Clark, the wrestling jock.Ally Sheedy, as Allison Reynolds, the proto-emo outcast girl.Molly Ringwald, as Claire Standish, the designer clothes wearing princess.Judd Nelson, as John Bender, the defiant kid, the one we would have called a hood back in the day.Bender is a veteran of the detention routine, very well acquainted with Vernon.The last five characters are the students forced to come in for Saturday detention, during which Principal Vernon has given them the assignment of writing a 1,000 word essay about exactly what each of them thinks he/she really is.That alone sets the tone for how bellicose Vernon is going to be, even before he starts interacting with them.Bender immediately expresses his disdain for him within the first five minutes of Vernon setting the terms, with one of the funniest lines I recall in a movie: ""Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe?"" winning himself yet another Saturday on the spot.From there, Bender systematically sets about tormenting first Vernon, then each of the kids, focusing particularly on Claire, someone who couldn't be more his polar opposite in attitude and economic status.At first, it's tough to like Bender, given his boorish treatment of first Claire, then to Brian and Andrew, but there is something charismatic about him that starts to show through, and he turns out to be surprisingly intelligent.He propels the story, especially for the first two thirds, clashing with principal and kid alike, but bringing out in each something that wouldn't have emerged otherwise.Claire is troubled by how her parents seem to use her against each other, and -- as is common with the popular kids -- held prisoner to her friends' dictates.Allison is ignored by her parents and basically friendless at the beginning of the movie.Andrew is a jock driven relentlessly by a dad obsessed with winning to the exclusion of all else.Brian is quite a bit like Andrew, except both parents are obsessed with his academic achievement.Then we have Bender, who proves he's not just telling stories when he memorably reenacts how he has been badly physically abused at home.Watching this all over again, I realize that I knew all of the characters to one extent or another in high school, and most people could identify with each to one degree or another.The dialogue is biting, often witty, and nearly always sarcastic.The conflict that only grows with time between Bender and Vernon propels the movie, and Bender's harsh words for each of the kids eventually get them to open up in ways they never would have done without him to berate them.Because of this juxtaposition of the sarcastic with the sadness each of them has, this manages to be a very touching movie that does so without being cloying about it.I won't spoil the movie for those of you who have yet to see it, but I will just say that this is no action movie or cookie cutter teen movie.This is about the universal misgivings that people have throughout their lives, especially when they are young and at their most vulnerable.There is little doubt that Judd Nelson's Bender is the driving force here, and he is very good in that role, wildly veering from wickedly funny to exploding into rage, with only his unusually strong command of the English language making him just a bit unbelievable.Ally Sheedy's Allison has the least dialogue by far, but she plays it very well, getting the maximum out of her character with her expressions and the laborious way that she speaks, as Nelson and Hall observe during the commentary track, as if she were unpracticed at speaking.Hall plays Brian very well, just the type of personality of the nerdy guy, but with a nerd's sensitivity and intelligence.Estevez's Andrew is in some ways even better, first playing tough guy tempered with chivalry by standing up to Bender's taunting of Claire, then showing that he really is much more than just an athlete, especially when recounting the real reason that he got put on detention with the others and when talking one-on-one with Allison.Ringwald's Claire is also very good, and she is a nice foil for Bender, who quickly pivots from tweaking Vernon to making openly crude comments toward her.At first, it's tough to feel too sorry for her, given her membership in the popular clique, but she emerges as someone who would prefer to be her own person, and it turns out that Bender, is the one person who brings that out more than anyone else.Kapelo as Carl didn't have much time on screen, but he was a real highlight, showing that he is much more than a blue collar guy, but someone with a real understanding of human nature and wisdom.Gleason as Vernon was in some ways the best of all, not just a cardboard cutout authoritarian, but someone even with just a hint of self doubt. He is particularly funny, with his impenetrable front that first Bender, then the other kids, and finally even he (unintentionally) puncture throughout the movie.Anyone wondering about the R rating for this should know that there is no nudity or anything of the sort, but that the reason for the rating was because of some harsh language, with some sexual comments thrown in.This is a nicely packaged Blu-Ray, with both the regular movie and the audio commentary version with Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, and DVD producer Jason Hillhouse.You also get a 12-part documentary titled ""Sincerely Yours,"" with focus placed on each of the actors, plus various other aspects of the movie itself.They also include the five minute ""The Most Convenient Definitions: The Origins of the Brat Pack,"" a short discussion of exactly what it says, and speaking for myself, I always thought that term was unfairly dismissive, condescending, and smacked of a certain elitism of elders toward young upstarts.This is a BD-Live disk, so there are some features available through it directly online, but I didn't really bother exploring those.Picture quality was good and certainly an improvement over conventional DVD upscaled on a 1080p set, but I was surprised at how it was slightly grainy in parts when I got up close to my 1080p TV, almost as if the producers had simply produced the Blu-Ray from the exact same resolution master from the DVD release instead of going back to the original film itself to make a Blu-Ray specific master.However, the minor graininess in no way detracted from the movie, which is -- after all -- about the characters.I realize that John Hughes was often derided by the elites in show business when he was still alive, and to some extent even now, but this to me is one of his two very best movies, the other being the superbPlanes, Trains and Automobiles (Those Aren't Pillows Edition).I highly recommend either movie, and consider yourself lucky if it's the first time watching it.",5,"Dear Mr. Vernon,",1328486400,"02 6, 2012",2012,7363,"['was', 'real', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'movie', 'once', 'again', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'originally', 'saw', 'was',

That's too bad because I might have been a bit more receptive to the characters portrayed in this movie.  In my mid 50's I find myself a bit stretched to buy into them.  Allowing somewhat for my aged perspective, I could tell from the dialogue and interaction between the high schoolers that the writers were looking at exploring relationships at an age when they are most volitile.  Overall, this works pretty well.  My problem is that we had a group of 5 kids who each filled a different high school stereotype; the jock, the hood, the nerd, the homecoming queen, and the misfit nobody likes.  How uncanny that they all were so diverse from one another.  Wouldn't life in high school have been easier if the numbers had so nicely evened out?  If we could have always gone one on one?  I admit that I didn't care for the three boys to two girls ratio but otherwise I'm sure I could have handled high school a lot better with those odds.  The problem never was individuals; it was groups of liked minded individuals who preyon on, mocked or simply ignored other ""lesser"" groups.  I realize that the writer/director John Hughes chose this format to escape those limitations.  Unfortunately, reality never was that convenient.High school has always been a tough time for most kids.  Unfortunately, even the ones who sailed through with popularity often found that those were life's highlights; what came after never seemed to match it.  Most of us learned valuable lessons that we only understood later but getting through the roller coaster didn't always seem worth it at the time.  I acknowledge that these feeling were, at times, excellently put on display in ""The Breakfast Club"".  However, each time the soul searching looked like it was going to touch a nerve, uncovered a hidden reality, or display honest sincerity, we suddenly found out it was all the fault of lousy parenting.  What a cop out! (to borrow a phrase from my high school days).  All authority  in ""The Breakfast Club"" is, by far, more dysfunctional that these hormone-crazed teenagers; was this supposed to be a comedy?  Still, the ""discoveries"" were hard-earned and we went through a lot of emotion and thought to get there.All in all, this is a good movie.  As you can tell, it took me back to my high school days.  I watched it with my 8th grade son who got interested when he heard the opening song.  We saw a cleaned-up version but there was still a lot of serious stuff in the movie.  I couldn't tell if he got a lot out of the movie but he didn't get up from his chair til it was finished.  I rated this movie 4 stars because, despite my objections, I felt Hughes made a valient effort.",4,Stereotypes with a Little Depth to Them,1127865600,"09 28, 2005",2005,2741,"['must', 'have', 'missed', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'mid', '1980', 'too', 'bad', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'receptive', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'mid', '50', 'find', 'bit', 'stretched', 'buy', 'Allowing', 'somewhat', 'aged', 'perspective', 'could', 'tell', 'dialogue', 'interaction', 'high', 'schoolers', 'writers', 'were', 'looking', 'exploring', 'relationships', 'age', 'when', 'are', 'most', 'volitile', 'Overall', 'pretty', 'well', 'problem', 'had', 'group', '5', 'kids', 'who', 'filled', 'different', 'high', 'school', 'stereotype', 'jock', 'hood', 'nerd', 'homecoming', 'queen', 'misfit', 'nobody', 'likes', 'How', 'uncanny', 'were', 'so', 'diverse', 'one', 'Would', ""n't"", 'life', 'high', 'school', 'have', 'been', 'easier', 'numbers', 'had', 'so', 'nicely', 'evened', 'out', 'could', 'have', 'always', 'gone', 'one', 'one', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'three', 'boys', 'two', 'girls', 'ratio', 'otherwise', ""'m"", 'sure', 'could', 'have', 'handled', 'high', 'school', 'lot', 'better', 'odds', 'problem', 'never', 'was', 'individuals', 'was', 'groups', 'liked', 'minded', 'individuals', 'who', 'preyon', 'mocked', 'simply', 'ignored', 'other', 'lesser', 'groups', 'realize', 'writer/director', 'John', 'Hughes', 'chose', 'format', 'escape', 'limitations', 'Unfortunately', 'reality', 'never', 'was', 'convenient.High', 'school', 'always', 'been', 'tough', 'time', 'most', 'kids', 'Unfortunately', 'even', 'ones', 'who', 'sailed', 'popularity', 'often', 'found', 'were', 'life', 'highlights', 'what', 'came', 'never', 'seemed', 'match', 'Most', 'learned', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'only', 'understood', 'later', 'getting', 'roller', 'coaster', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'seem', 'time', 'acknowledge', 'feeling', 'were', 'times', 'excellently', 'put', 'display', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'However', 'time', 'soul', 'searching', 'looked', 'was', 'going', 'touch', 'nerve', 'uncovered', 'hidden', 'reality', 'display', 'honest', 'sincerity', 'suddenly', 'found', 'was', 'fault', 'lousy', 'parenting', 'What', 'cop', 'out', 'borrow', 'phrase', 'high', 'school', 'days', 'authority', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'far', 'more', 'dysfunctional', 'hormone-crazed', 'teenagers', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'Still', 'discoveries', 'were', 'hard-earned', 'went', 'lot', 'emotion', 'thought', 'get', 'there.All', 'good', 'movie', 'can', 'tell', 'took', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'days', 'watched', '8th', 'grade', 'son', 'who', 'got', 'interested', 'when', 'heard', 'opening', 'song', 'saw', 'cleaned-up', 'version', 'was', 'still', 'lot', 'serious', 'stuff', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'got', 'lot', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'up', 'chair', 'was', 'finished', 'rated', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'because', 'objections', 'felt', 'Hughes', 'made', 'valient', 'effort']",The Breakfast Club

It takes place in the '80s when Saturday detentions were popular punishments in high schools. The film is about five very different high school students who all wind up in Saturday detention for different reasons. They at first hate each other, because they feel as though they've got nothing in common. There's the &quot;nerd&quot; (Anthony Michael Hall), the &quot;jock&quot; (Emilio Estevez), the &quot;princess&quot; (Molly Ringwald), the &quot;metalhead&quot; (Judd Nelson), and the &quot;weirdo&quot; (Ally Sheedy). But at the end, they pour out their hearts and souls to each other and what they really feel, and also learn how to have fun together even while in Saturday detention, which helps them to form what is known as the &quot;breakfast club&quot;. The acting by the entire cast is absolutely superb. I am a high school student so I can really relate to the film - all of the teen agony the characters have in  the film. The storyline, plot, and script are truly amazing, and the directing is well done. Kundos to John Hughes for making a great, wonderous film! THE BREAKFAST CLUB goes on my list of top 10 all-time favorite films. And, if you enjoyed THE BREAKFAST CLUB, then I strongly recommend DEAD POETS SOCIETY, FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF, STAND BY ME, and THE KARATE KID films! This DVD is a must, even though not many special features were added onto it, which was kind of a disappointment, especially to those who love buying DVDs because of all the great extra special features the DVD has instead of the VHS.

These will be the first real special features to have been included with The Breakfast Club on DVD.  It's known that there are deleted scenes (some have been shown on TV), but there was no mention of any in the announcement for the new DVD.The Breakfast Club is considered by many the quintessential high school movie, which is quite a comment on high school, as almost the entire film takes place in detention.  Five students, each representing a type but fleshed out into real characters as the film develops, are stuck together on a Saturday in detention.  In terms they use themselves, there's a ""criminal"" (Judd Nelson), a ""princess"" (Molly Ringwald), a ""jock"" (Emilio Estevez), a ""brain"" (Anthony Michael Hall), and a ""basket case"" (Ally Sheedy).  Effectively portrayed tension between the five builds to explosive levels before they finally discover how much they have in common.  There is a lot of sharp humor, some hijinks, a lot of emotional release in the last third.  The acting is very good.  Nelson is especially good as the main catalyst for the tension, projecting a powerful personality and sharp mind turned in against self and back out at others.I loved this movie in the '80s.  I still like it and admire it now, though its formula seems a little more prominent to me than it used to.  By today's standards it may seem to pull its punches when it comes to the reasons kids have to be unhappy and in trouble, but it strikes a fair balance between entertaining teen comedy and realism.  It's also a fine time capsule from the '80s.The new DVD will be 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with English Dolby Digital 5.1 and English DTS 5.1.

The writing is sharp and crisp, and apart from a few patches of overdone juvenile behavior, the dialogue flows seamlessly.Sure, the movie has its warts. Parents are the root of all the kids' problems; there are annoying lapses in logic (like how does Ringwald get to see Nelson at the end and Sheedys character wasn't assigned detention, so wouldn't Gleason know that) and there is a somewhat prolonged but inconsequential dance sequence smooshed in.Yet, twenty two years on, the movie still rings as true as ever because school life remains essentially the same -- same sorts of conflict between generations, private fears often undisclosed to the outside world, worries about their futures nagging them, etc etc.A truly enjoyable, clever brat-pack character study.

There are no real bonus feautures(unless you count the recommendations for a few other John Hughes films and the theatrical trailer for ""The Breakfast Club""),though. The remastering is good enough to forget bonus feautures.

Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[5, 5]","The Breakfast Club is an 80's teen cult classic directed by John Hughes, who also gave us Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Sixteen Candles and Home Alone, and starring teen icons Molly Ringwald (Sixteen Candles), Judd Nelson (St Elmo's Fire), Emilio Estevez (Young Guns), Anthony Michael Hall (Sixteen Candles), Ally Sheedy (Short Circuit), and Paul Gleason (Trading Places).Five high school students who have nothing in common spend an entire Saturday detention in the school library where the principal, Mr. Vernon played by Gleason, assigns them to write a paper telling him who they are. In the next hour and a half, we get to know who they are and we build a connection to five types of students that every school has: the nerd who cannot get anything less than an A, the spoiled rich brat that everyone calls 'queenie', the athlete who's pressured by his dad and coach to be tough even if it means bullying others around, the 'criminal' who has an abusive father and might as well ""not even exist at the school"", and the drunken and gothic 'shopping bag' girl who's ignored by everyone around her including her parents.The movie is funny, but touches upon some serious issues that teenagers deal with under different circumstances. John Hughes directs his young actors with such flair that each character shines onscreen and engage us, the viewers, with their dilemmas.The Breakfast Club along with its soundtrack featuring the Simple Minds classic hit Don't You Forget About Me are still outstanding 20 years on.RecommendedA",5,Don't you forget about The Breakfast Club!,1140134400,"02 17, 2006",2006,1524,"['Breakfast', 'Club', '80', 'teen', 'cult', 'classic', 'directed', 'John', 'Hughes', 'who', 'also', 'gave', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Day', 'Off', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'Home', 'Alone', 'starring', 'teen', 'icons', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'St', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'Young', 'Guns', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'Short', 'Circuit', 'Paul', 'Gleason', 'Trading', 'Places', '.Five', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'who', 'have', 'nothing', 'common', 'spend', 'entire', 'Saturday', 'detention', 'school', 'library', 'where', 'principal', 'Mr.', 'Vernon', 'played', 'Gleason', 'write', 'paper', 'telling', 'who', 'are', 'next', 'hour', 'half', 'get', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'build', 'connection', 'five', 'types', 'students', 'school', 'nerd', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'anything', 'less', 'A', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'brat', 'everyone', ""'queenie"", 'athlete', 'who', 'pressured', 'dad', 'coach', 'be', 'tough', 'even', 'bullying', 'others', ""'criminal"", 'who', 'abusive', 'father', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'even', 'exist', 'school', 'drunken', 'gothic', ""'shopping"", 'bag', 'girl', 'who', 'ignored', 'everyone', 'including', 'parents.The', 'movie', 'funny', 'touches', 'serious', 'issues', 'teenagers', 'deal', 'different', 'circumstances', 'John', 'Hughes', 'young', 'actors', 'such', 'flair', 'character', 'shines', 'onscreen', 'engage', 'viewers', 'dilemmas.The', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'soundtrack', 'featuring', 'Simple', 'Minds', 'classic', 'hit', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Forget', 'Me', 'are', 'still', 'outstanding', '20', 'years', 'on.RecommendedA']",The Breakfast Club

Maybe that 5 students has to meet at 7:00 for a 9 hour dention. Then why didn't they call this The Dention Club instead of The Breakfast Club? As the movie opens, 5 students report to school for a dention. The staff member (Paul Gleason) in charge gives a 1,000 word essay on who the students think they are. They all have diffrent personality traits. There is a princess (Molly Ringwald), a brain (Anothony Michael Hall), a jock (Emilio Estevez), a criminal (Judd Nelson), and the weird one (Ally Sheedy). The criminal steals a screw and closes the doors of the dention room that angries the staff member who has to spend the time in school in his office next to the dention room, and instead of working on the eassy, they spend thier time talking expect for the weird one. This is a great movie to watch if you love teen movies, but this movie has a R rating for lanuage and I'm not sure if it rated R for anything else. This is also a must watch if you are a big fan of teen movies, or if you are a fan of one more more of the cast members. But this movie could have also been called the lunch club. But this more doesn't have a lot of characters, I say the movie has about 10 characters, and the 5 main characters are spending a Saturday in dentention.

57146,A65XH6L5BUX0X,078322687X,"TheClassicsNut65 ""morgan miller""","[0, 0]","I remember first seeing this movie when I was like six years old. My Daddy used to watch it every time her found on TV. I must say I use to hate this movie so much. Why? I guess it was because I didn't understand it when I was younger. But since I have gotten older, I see it in a different light. I can relate to it more now, especially when I became a high school freshman, it shows me that there are many walks of life. And who says we can't I be friends?The Breakfast Club has a very simple plot: five high school-aged kids are sentenced to a Saturday in detention. Each character personifies a clich&eacute;d, but somewhat misunderstood stereotype. We have the jock/athlete, Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez); the nerd/brain, Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall); the popular girl/princess, Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald); the bad boy/criminal, John Bender (Judd Nelson); and the outsider/basket case, Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy). The adult characters include Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason), the strict school assistant principal; Carl Reed (John Kapelos), the goofy school janitor; Brian's strict mother; Andrew's controlling father; and Claire's dimwitted/rich father.So why would this little teen comedy-drama be so long-lasting? I guess just because it shows us that all children, from all walks of life, have challenging home lives and are under a lot of pressure. It does also show us that everybody can get along with another, if (and I stress IF) we put our minds to it. I mean why do we think we shouldn't get along? Just because someone is different in their looks, personality, sexual preference, why shouldn't we respect them and at least try to compromise our differences? Society is the answer. The public that has surrounded us has in a way ""brainwashed"" us into believing that we shouldn't get along. This movie shows us we can.Besides from the lessons this movie does offer, The Breakfast Club has sort of became a cultural phenomenon. It has been parodied (most recently on Nickelodeon's Victorious) and has consistently dominated popularity polls for best teen films of all time, and as one of the best films of the 1980s in general. It finds new audiences in a new generation everyday. I mean come on, if this doesn't tell people this movie has ""something"", I don't know what will.The movie has often been noted as the quintessential ""Brat Pack"" movie. The most famous Brat Pack members, Ringwald, Hall, Nelson, Sheedy, and Estevez, are all represented in this movie. Other members of the infamous ""club"" include: Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, and Andrew McCarthy, although they made far less appearances in so-called ""Brat Pack movies"".In general, The Breakfast Club has a lot to offer. Comedy. Drama. Lessons. And just about everything else. It is a perfect film I think a lot of young people should see. The edited versions (which cut out the inferior language and sexual references) could be shown in High Schools and still have the same affect. The Breakfast Club will not disappoint you. It should not anyways. I must say, though, if you have negative or snobbish feelings about the movie already, odds are you won't see what the fuss is all about. It's a movie. A great movie. A movie that should never be forgotten.

I was there and the 80s, though they might seem cool from a 2005 perspective, weren't, and they weren't fun either.  This movie is definitely one on the highlights of the decade though.  Funny, insightful, intelligent, poignant, with one liners that never get old.  This movie definitely stands up to repeated viewings.  My only complaint is Ally Sheedy.  Though this is her most remembered role of the 80s, and probably of all time, her acting is less than stellar (though the same can be said of the others, particularly Emilio Estevez).  Don't get me wrong, the others do a great job here.  But, when you think about all the roles of all these actors (the five leads, not Paul Gleason), the sum is meager when you substract this and 'Sixteen Candles'.

57151,AV5G37VFE5NVD,078322687X,Tom Benton,"[0, 0]","There was an abundance of teen films in the 1980s.  That was one of the defining parts of the decade.  Though many of those were great - and many were terrible - few came close to the greatness of THE BREAKFAST CLUB.  Since its release in 1985, it has become a contemporary classic, winning over viewers for more than twenty years.  As of yesterday, I am one of the countless viewers in love with this film.THE BREAKFAST CLUB spans eight hours on a grey Saturday, where five teenagers are gathering at Shermer High School for detention.  At first glance, this is how they appear: Andy (Emilio Estevez) is just another jock.  Brian (Anthony Michael Hall) is a nerd, a brain, a geek.  Bender (Judd Nelson) is a rude, rambunctious troublemaker.  Claire (Molly Ringwald) is a stuck-up rich girl.  Allison (Ally Sheedy) is odd, quiet, disturbed, the precursor to the Gothic girl.  These five kids go into Shermer High with nothing in common, but when they come out, their lives will be changed forever.John Hughes is universally acknowledged to be the King of Teen Movies, but he's much more.  He is a very talented writer and director, and THE BREAKFAST CLUB is clear, undeniable evidence of this.  The script is very likely one of the greatest ever written, filled with great dialogue including memorable moments of humor and shocking moments of drama.  Hughes' directing wrings out Academy Award-worthy performances from the cast - which is, of course, stellar.  Hall is probably the most likable of the bunch, but Nelson is the most amusing.  His character is one whom we hate, then laugh with, then sympathize with, then hate again, and finally, love.  Sheedy's character is delightfully weird.  Paul Gleason is perfectly hateable as Principal Vernon, and John Kapelos is perfectly likable as Carl the janitor.THE BREAKFAST CLUB is emotional, shocking, and filled with dialogue that is undeniably true.  The cast is great, the script is brilliant, the directing is top-notch, the editing is seamless, and to top it off there's a great soundtrack including music by Simple Minds and Wang Chung.  This is not only the ultimate 80s teen flick - it may very well be one of the greatest films ever made.

This is pretty accurate by todays standards except for the dated music and clothing, but the issues and the cliques are still the same. Actually the only cast members clothing that didn't go out of style is the nerds clothes. (Nerd never goes out of style) Anyway, John Hughes's popular 1985 teen drama finds the usual groups of high school students a jock, a metalhead a weirdo, a princess, and a nerd sharing a Saturday in detention at their high school for one minor infraction or another. Over the course of a day, they talk through the social barriers that ordinarily keep them apart, and new alliances are born, though not without a lot of pain first. But man it gets painful when they see themselves for they really are, and they see that none of them is better than the other.

Five teens representing the most generic types of high schoolers(the brain, the beauty, the athlete, the criminal, and the recluse) being put together in isolation for a day and the movie follows the interactions and feelings they share with each other.  It is funny at parts and sad at parts and it almost shows that everyone can be together peacefully.  Unfortunately, it is not that way in real life, and the characters even touch on how society will break each class of people apart.  They stay true to their stereotypes in the beginning and keep apart from each other; but given time, they slowly move together until they destroy their stereotypes and labels and become the same people.  You'll love all the characters and can easily relate any of them to someone from your high school.  it touches on the minds of teens and hasn't dated a bit since the 80's in my opinion.

I can say, however, that I was very pleased with the picture quality.Fans know this movie has a very basic storyline, and very few scene changes.  But nonetheless, you still get a juicy taste of 1080p while watching it.  Facial closeups look crystal clear and gorgeous, while the background has fantastic depth.  This is particularly vivid during the ending speeches.  The depth is so perfect you have that great 3D feel that makes Blu Ray fans giddy.As far as grain and flickers are concerned, I didn't see any.  I may not be as picky as some HD scholars, but I was actively trying to look for any signs of a bad transfer nothing caught my immediate attention.My only complaint about this release, as is my complaint with just about every Universal release, is that the loading time is a little ridiculous.  I'm not sure if it's their main menu template or what, but all my Universal blus take ages to load.Overall, if you've never seen this movie you really ought to watch it.  Many try to make intelligent high school movies, but very few succeed.  The Breakfast Club is one of the lucky few.  It's heartfelt, it's emotional, it's well acted, directed, and written.  Its stood the test of time (25 years!) but thanks to blu ray, you can now watch it and feel like you're viewing a new release because of the perfect clarity.  Even if you have seen it a 1000 times, however, I'm willing to bet its worth the DVD upgrade.

But somehow there was a whole snow balling effect that made people over love this film.  Yeah, seriously, it isn't bad but it's no classic.I guess people's over enthusiastic remembrance of this movie could be golden nostalgia but there was a dearth of any actually decent movies during the entire decade.  Culture was such a wasteland back during the 80s.  And I know.  This was my youth.  This was my decade.  But most of us were just jealous our older cousins got the 70s.  That was a true culture moment right there.  At what other time could a young man put on a pink tux, get the afro rising up and get the hottest girl to go with him to the prom?So for most of us with any sense of context simply saw the 80s as a way lay between the far superior 50's, 60's, 70's and the promise that lay ahead in the 90s and beyond.Seriously, what other decade was as devoid of substance like the 80s.  I woulda preferred the 30's with the Great Depression over the sentimental schmaltz people lay all over the 80s.  It was such a disappointment.And the Breakfast Club is the epitome of it all.  The coolest guy we can come up with is a 32 year old Judd Nelson playing a dirtbag loser that somehow we should aspire towards?  He was too old to play a college grad in St Elmo's Fire a year later.  And the quotes?  C'mon what decent quote really came from this celluloid marvel?  Well, don't ask me, I banged my head against a shovel to finally let loose of that moronic 'Bull by the Horns' jib.The movie lacked all sense of style so in a way it really does encapsulate the 80s.  It was nothing but cliche infested take on the obsession adults had in telling us teens all about the cliques gathering in schools and how we had to avoid them to protect our innocence.Still somehow it has wormed it's way up in the collective hearts of so many that it's somehow not only fondly remembered but has topped some charts as best of the decade.  How?  I dunno.  Raiders obviously.  Back to The Future definitely and a few others.  But only a few.

The black bars are rather large though, if you have a 16:9 TV you may be able to minimise these.The sound quality is the DVD's biggest let-down.  Mono city, and does it show!  Sounds so flat and can be hard to hear what characters are saying in some scenes.But even with these letdowns, the DVD is worth owning for the film alone.  It is a film you will want to watch over and over.

57169,AMMEMPM9MPS55,078322687X,www.DavidLRattigan.com,"[0, 4]","The Breakfast Club is a damn enjoyable film. It stands out as a classic of its genre, the '80s teen movie, the &quot;brat pack&quot; flicks exemplified in the films of John Hughes (Ferris Bueller's Day Off). In Hughes's world, the grown-ups are exposed as morons, and here it is Paul Gleason as high school Principal Richard Vernon (&quot;Does Barry Manilow know you raided his wardrobe?&quot;) as the token object of humiliation.In The Breakfast Club, five students find themselves thrown together for a Saturday detention. Throughout the course of the day they fight, they cause mischief, they laugh, they cry, they get high, and they wind up discovering that as different as they are from each other on the surface -- the rich kid, the geek, the troublemaker -- underneath they're the same ordinary kids going through the same ordinary struggles.You may have to ignore some of the amoral implications of the story to appreciate it. And you will have to find it in your heart to forgive the cheesiness as Hughes presents every cliche of his era one by one. Overlook some of the utter implausibilities and absurdities the film throws at us.

57170,AP3B615GM191G,078322687X,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","To be completely honest, I usually hate movies like this.  It's like Don McLean's song ""American Pie"", where basically he just mashes up a whole bunch of different themes and lets people interpret them to death.  It kind of takes the fun out of the experience.  Fortunately, director John Hughes (Mr. 80s himself!) doesn't allow his weighty material to get in the way of the film's true message.Basically, the plot of this film centers on a group of five high-schoolers dragging into the school on a Saturday to serve their detention ""sentence"".  They come from all walks of life: The Rebel (Judd Nelson), The Jock (Emilio Estevez), The Princess (Molly Ringwald), The Troubled (Ally Sheedy) and The Nerd (Anthony Michael Hall).  While being lorded over by Principal Richard Vernon (played brilliantly by Paul Gleason; he almost steals the show!), the self-dubbed ""Breakfast Club"" start to get to know each other a little bit.From there, the rest of the film is essentially two things: a series of hilarious sight/action gags to foil Mr. Vernon, and (more importantly) a treatise on the cliquish life of high school students.  Led by the colorful commentary of Nelson's hard-edged character, each stereotype is carefully picked apart and laid bare for the world to see.  Is ""Ringwald"" truly a good girl, or just fooling herself?  Is ""Hall"" a dedicated student, or just playing the role to keep the few friendships he has?  Plus, the instigator (""Nelson"") turns out to be perhaps the most interesting character-study of them all!What keeps the movie from seeming too high-handy and sappy, though, is the wonderful directing of Hughes.  Unlike, say, James Cameron's ""Avatar"", where the issues are preached to you in black-and-white terms with no room for disagreement, Hughes leaves it up to the viewer to decide who ""The Breakfast Club"" members really are.  You can view them as Mr. Vernon does, or have the opportunity to delve in deeper if you so choose.Thus, I have no problems recommending this film to any and all fans of movies that will really make you think.  The ending may be too cheesy (but probably needed to satisfy the teen audience), but along the way it packs quite an intellectual and emotional punch, with a hefty dose of comedy thrown in as well.",4,"A Little Cheesy, But Gets You Thinking",1267747200,"03 5, 2010",2010,2263,"['be', 'completely', 'honest', 'usually', 'hate', 'movies', 'Don', 'McLean', 'song', 'American', 'Pie', 'where', 'basically', 'just', 'up', 'whole', 'bunch', 'different', 'themes', 'people', 'interpret', 'death', 'kind', 'fun', 'experience', 'Fortunately', 'director', 'John', 'Hughes', 'Mr.', '80s', ""n't"", 'allow', 'weighty', 'material', 'get', 'way', 'film', 'true', 'message.Basically', 'plot', 'film', 'centers', 'group', 'five', 'high-schoolers', 'dragging', 'school', 'Saturday', 'serve', 'detention', 'sentence', 'come', 'walks', 'life', 'Rebel', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'Jock', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'Princess', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'Troubled', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'Nerd', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'being', 'lorded', 'Principal', 'Richard', 'Vernon', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Paul', 'Gleason', 'almost', 'show', 'self-dubbed', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'start', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'little', 'bit.From', 'there', 'rest', 'film', 'essentially', 'two', 'things', 'series', 'hilarious', 'sight/action', 'gags', 'foil', 'Mr.', 'Vernon', 'more', 'importantly', 'treatise', 'cliquish', 'life', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'Led', 'colorful', 'commentary', 'Nelson', 'hard-edged', 'character', 'stereotype', 'carefully', 'picked', 'apart', 'laid', 'bare', 'world', 'see', 'Ringwald', 'truly', 'good', 'girl', 'just', 'fooling', 'Hall', 'dedicated', 'student', 'just', 'playing', 'role', 'keep', 'few', 'friendships', 'instigator', 'Nelson', 'out', 'be', 'perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'character-study', 'What', 'movie', 'seeming', 'too', 'high-handy', 'sappy', 'though', 'wonderful', 'directing', 'Hughes', 'say', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Avatar', 'where', 'issues', 'are', 'preached', 'black-and-white', 'terms', 'room', 'disagreement', 'Hughes', 'up', 'viewer', 'decide', 'who', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'members', 'really', 'are', 'can', 'view', 'Mr.', 'Vernon', 'have', 'opportunity', 'delve', 'deeper', 'so', 'choose.Thus', 'have', 'problems', 'recommending', 'film', 'fans', 'movies', 'will', 'really', 'make', 'think', 'ending', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'cheesy', 'probably', 'needed', 'satisfy', 'teen', 'audience', 'way', 'quite', 'intellectual', 'emotional', 'punch', 'hefty', 'dose', 'comedy', 'thrown', 'as', 'well']",The Breakfast Club
