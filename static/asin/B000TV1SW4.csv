Brownrigg.I had seen Don't look in the Basement several times before and consider it a decent if unexceptional thriller.I'd never seen Don't Open the Door before so I figured why not take a chance since I liked Basement ? Well Don't Open the Door is just a lousy movie so that makes the whole package lose 1 star right there.Terrible story,lousy acting,annoying as all hell killer/phone stalker,slow as molasses pacing,no thrills or suspense just 90 or so minutes of tedious crap.At least Basement was well thought out if also a tad slow and the acting was better even the low budget fx are better than in Door.I'd recommend trying to buy Don't look in the Basement as a solo disc and avoid Don't Open the Door unless you are a sucker for punishment.",1,Two Movies one Dud,1208822400,"04 22, 2008",2008,892,"['Well', 'took', 'chance', 'double', 'disc', 'set', 'featuring', '1973', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Basement', '1979', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Open', 'Door', 'directed', 'S.F', 'Brownrigg.I', 'had', 'seen', 'Do', ""n't"", 'look', 'Basement', 'several', 'times', 'consider', 'decent', 'unexceptional', 'thriller.I', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Open', 'Door', 'so', 'figured', 'why', 'not', 'take', 'chance', 'liked', 'Basement', 'Well', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Open', 'Door', 'just', 'lousy', 'movie', 'whole', 'package', 'lose', '1', 'star', 'right', 'there.Terrible', 'story', 'lousy', 'acting', 'annoying', 'hell', 'killer/phone', 'stalker', 'slow', 'molasses', 'pacing', 'thrills', 'suspense', 'just', '90', 'so', 'minutes', 'tedious', 'crap.At', 'least', 'Basement', 'was', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'also', 'tad', 'slow', 'acting', 'was', 'better', 'even', 'low', 'budget', 'fx', 'are', 'better', 'Door.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'trying', 'buy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'look', 'Basement', 'solo', 'disc', 'avoid', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Open', 'Door', 'are', 'sucker', 'punishment']",N/A
1092343,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B000TV1SW4,Carl Manes,"[4, 7]","Don't Look in the Basement---------------------------A young nurse finds herself at the mercy of an insane medical staff when she arrives at a remote institution, only to find out that the original staff had been killed and the crazies are running the nuthouse! This trashy Grindhouse classic is torn and tattered, using only the most rudimentary filming on a non-existent budget. The film's greatest strengths lies in its kooky characters and exaggerated performances that create a true sense of delirium and madness. In its original run, it was double-billed with THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, which shared its tasteless violence and crude production. Though the plotting is easily predictable, the pace moves along at a quick pace with enough kills and gratuitous nudity to hold the audience's attention until the final payoff in the end. DON'T earned its way on to the infamous Video Nasties list in the UK thanks to several bloody moments of early gore. After its original release in 1973 as THE FORGOTTEN, distributors changed the title during the film's re-release to cash in on the popular ""DON'T"" trend in schlocky Exploitation films of the late 70s and early 80s. For a cheapie shocker, DON'T makes for a great deal of bloody good fun!Don't Open the Door--------------------S.F. Brownrigg's sleazy followup to the Grindhouse classic DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT trails a young woman as she returns home to the house where her mother was killed 13 years earlier in order to tend to her dying grandmother. It isn't long before she begins receiving deranged phone calls from her mother's killer as he stalks her in the empty house. Exploitation films generally require three basic elements in order to succeed: gratuitous nudity, lurid violence, and abusive gore. DON'T fails on all accounts. It is a bloodless, vapid affair that stumbles through various Horror movie cliches without ever generating any terror or suspense. Browning makes no attempt to hide the identity of the ""mysterious"" caller thanks to shoddy lighting, and seems to have drawn heavily from the success of BLACK CHRISTMAS released the year prior. Susan Bracken's performance deters the audience from identifying with her character, which leaves the film with no emotional draw throughout her frightening ordeal. DON'T OPEN THE DOOR does not share the offbeat humor or horror that drove audiences to see DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT, and proves to be an easily forgettable sequel.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",3,Dont Look in the Basement / Dont Open the Door,1273017600,"05 5, 2010",2010,2482,"['Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Basement', '-A', 'young', 'nurse', 'mercy', 'insane', 'medical', 'staff', 'when', 'remote', 'institution', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'original', 'staff', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'crazies', 'are', 'running', 'nuthouse', 'trashy', 'Grindhouse', 'classic', 'torn', 'tattered', 'using', 'only', 'most', 'rudimentary', 'filming', 'non-existent', 'budget', 'film', 'greatest', 'strengths', 'kooky', 'characters', 'exaggerated', 'performances', 'create', 'true', 'sense', 'delirium', 'madness', 'original', 'run', 'was', 'double-billed', 'LAST', 'HOUSE', 'ON', 'LEFT', 'shared', 'tasteless', 'violence', 'crude', 'production', 'plotting', 'easily', 'predictable', 'pace', 'along', 'quick', 'pace', 'enough', 'kills', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'hold', 'audience', 'attention', 'final', 'payoff', 'end', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'earned', 'way', 'infamous', 'Video', 'Nasties', 'list', 'UK', 'thanks', 'several', 'bloody', 'moments', 'early', 'gore', 'original', 'release', '1973', 'THE', 'FORGOTTEN', 'distributors', 'changed', 'title', 'film', 're-release', 'cash', 'popular', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'trend', 'schlocky', 'Exploitation', 'films', 'late', '70s', 'early', '80s', 'cheapie', 'shocker', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'great', 'deal', 'bloody', 'good', 'fun', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Open', 'Door', 'S.F', 'Brownrigg', 'sleazy', 'followup', 'Grindhouse', 'classic', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'LOOK', 'IN', 'THE', 'BASEMENT', 'young', 'woman', 'home', 'house', 'where', 'mother', 'was', 'killed', '13', 'years', 'earlier', 'order', 'tend', 'dying', 'grandmother', ""n't"", 'long', 'receiving', 'deranged', 'phone', 'calls', 'mother', 'killer', 'empty', 'house', 'Exploitation', 'films', 'generally', 'require', 'three', 'basic', 'elements', 'order', 'succeed', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'lurid', 'violence', 'abusive', 'gore', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'fails', 'accounts', 'bloodless', 'vapid', 'affair', 'various', 'Horror', 'movie', 'cliches', 'ever', 'generating', 'terror', 'suspense', 'Browning', 'attempt', 'hide', 'identity', 'mysterious', 'caller', 'thanks', 'shoddy', 'lighting', 'have', 'drawn', 'heavily', 'success', 'BLACK', 'CHRISTMAS', 'released', 'year', 'prior', 'Susan', 'Bracken', 'performance', 'audience', 'identifying', 'character', 'film', 'emotional', 'draw', 'frightening', 'ordeal', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'OPEN', 'THE', 'DOOR', 'not', 'share', 'offbeat', 'humor', 'horror', 'drove', 'audiences', 'see', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'LOOK', 'IN', 'THE', 'BASEMENT', 'be', 'easily', 'forgettable', 'sequel.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

But I happened to see Don't look in the Basement on a local channel that has a late night horror show. I wasn't aware this movie was considered Grindhouse. I thought the movie was good, nothing great. It's also funny that the movie has nothing to do with a basement. I think if this movie was remade today, it could be really amazing.",3,Don't Look in the Basement,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,380,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Open', 'Door', 'happened', 'see', 'Do', ""n't"", 'look', 'Basement', 'local', 'channel', 'late', 'night', 'horror', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'aware', 'movie', 'was', 'considered', 'Grindhouse', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'nothing', 'great', 'also', 'funny', 'movie', 'nothing', 'do', 'basement', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'remade', 'today', 'could', 'be', 'really', 'amazing']",N/A
1092345,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B000TV1SW4,Kasey G,"[1, 2]","VCI Entertainment brings us a double-dose of '70s exploitation/Grindhouse with this release of ""Don't Look in the Basement"" and ""Don't Open the Door"".While neither film is worth repeat viewings, ""Basement"" is the better of the two and at least boasts a grisly-but-seemingly-edited finale that makes it worth following til the bitter end.""Don't Look in the Basement"" concerns the goings-on at an isolated sanitarium for the insane where young Nurse Charlotte (1972 Playboy Playmate Rosie Holotik) has agreed to work for psychiatric expert Dr. Stephens. (I guess Claudia Jennings was busy filming her famous ""Brady Bunch"" episode the twelve days this turkey was filmed). Unfortunately, the good doctor has recently met with the sharp end of an axe by one of his patients, and his successor, the stern female physician Dr. Masters (a blonde Kathleen Freeman lookalike), gives Charlotte a stone-cold welcome.The script tries to divulge the backstory of each of the residents during the office scene where Charlotte meets Dr. Masters, but there are too many secondary characters to be developed fully. Still, the screenplay does a fair enough job for a cheap, sleazy drive-in flick.I was hoping in some way this would be one of the Holy Grail of Grindhouse such as ""I Drink Your Blood"" or ""The Baby"". Unfortunately, those two flicks set the bar so high I've yet to find anything that comes satisfyingly close.""Don't Look in the Basement"" has its moments, but it's no Exploitation Classic. Worth viewing at least once for fans of the genre.The second movie on this set, ""Don't Open the Door"" is a totally unsatisfying experience altogether. But you may want to watch it as a companion piece to ""Basement"" since it was made by the exact same people, in Texas and features many of the same actors, and you can spend a lot of the movie picking them out. ""Judge"" from ""Don't Look in the Basement"" even has the same name in this flick!I will say it's a refreshing change-of-pace to see normal looking (aka ""ugly"" by Hollywood standards) people in the cast. If these were remade today, the lead would be a Maxim cover-girl-type.The shoddy production stands out more in ""Door"" because the story is lousy and not as intriguing as ""Basement"". A strange opening credit sequence features the faces of some really ugly, bizarre dolls and ends abruptly. The poor editing is reminiscent of early '70s John Waters.The harpsichord score is the same in both movies, and it's hard to believe this was released in 1979 because the score sounds like something from a decade earlier.The plot revolves around 25-year-old Amanda, who receives an anonymous phone call to return to her Grandmother's house, because the old woman is in danger. When she arrives, she finds Grandma comatose and a shady doctor, judge and museum curator squatting in the large old house.We see a flashback where a 12-year-old Amanda (who looks as different from her adult counterpart as possible) discovers her mother in bed, knifed to death. This somehow is related to the obscene phone calls she begins receiving at Grandma's, but we're not quite sure why or how.And that's the main problem with this movie. It raises more questions than it answers. Why was Amanda's mother killed? Why are the town doctor, the judge and the museum owner so shady? What do they have invested in all of this nonsense? What is their motivation and how does it all tie in with the mother's murder? Don't ask because the script never bothers to answer.As Amanda, the lead actress displays a nasty attitude right from the start, until the last bit of the movie where she simply switches from ""angry"" mode to ""insane"".The films themselves look grainy and are not remastered (but did they really need to be?) and the audio is very low. The original trailers for both films are the only ""Bonus Features"" included.Those interested in cheap '70s horror may want to seek these out, but aside from a few choice moments in ""Basement"" they may end up disappointed.",3,"""Basement"" Worth a Look for '70s Exploitation Fans",1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,3983,"['VCI', 'Entertainment', 'double-dose', ""'70s"", 'exploitation/Grindhouse', 'release', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Basement', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Open', 'Door', 'film', 'worth', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'Basement', 'better', 'two', 'least', 'boasts', 'grisly-but-seemingly-edited', 'finale', 'worth', 'following', 'bitter', 'end', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Basement', 'goings-on', 'isolated', 'sanitarium', 'insane', 'where', 'young', 'Nurse', 'Charlotte', '1972', 'Playboy', 'Playmate', 'Rosie', 'Holotik', 'agreed', 'work', 'psychiatric', 'expert', 'Dr.', 'Stephens', 'guess', 'Claudia', 'Jennings', 'was', 'busy', 'filming', 'famous', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'episode', 'twelve', 'days', 'turkey', 'was', 'filmed', 'Unfortunately', 'good', 'doctor', 'recently', 'met', 'sharp', 'end', 'axe', 'one', 'patients', 'successor', 'stern', 'female', 'physician', 'Dr.', 'Masters', 'blonde', 'Kathleen', 'Freeman', 'lookalike', 'Charlotte', 'stone-cold', 'welcome.The', 'script', 'tries', 'divulge', 'backstory', 'residents', 'office', 'scene', 'where', 'Charlotte', 'Dr.', 'Masters', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'secondary', 'characters', 'be', 'developed', 'fully', 'Still', 'screenplay', 'fair', 'enough', 'job', 'cheap', 'sleazy', 'drive-in', 'flick.I', 'was', 'hoping', 'way', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'Grindhouse', 'such', 'Drink', 'Blood', 'Baby', 'Unfortunately', 'two', 'flicks', 'set', 'bar', 'so', 'high', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'find', 'anything', 'satisfyingly', 'close', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Basement', 'moments', 'Exploitation', 'Classic', 'viewing', 'least', 'once', 'fans', 'genre.The', 'second', 'movie', 'set', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Open', 'Door', 'totally', 'unsatisfying', 'experience', 'altogether', 'may', 'want', 'watch', 'companion', 'piece', 'Basement', 'was', 'made', 'exact', 'same', 'people', 'Texas', 'many', 'same', 'actors', 'can', 'spend', 'lot', 'movie', 'picking', 'out', 'Judge', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Basement', 'even', 'same', 'name', 'flick', 'will', 'say', 'refreshing', 'change-of-pace', 'see', 'normal', 'looking', 'ugly', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'people', 'cast', 'were', 'remade', 'today', 'lead', 'would', 'be', 'Maxim', 'cover-girl-type.The', 'shoddy', 'production', 'out', 'more', 'Door', 'story', 'lousy', 'not', 'as', 'intriguing', 'Basement', 'strange', 'opening', 'credit', 'sequence', 'really', 'ugly', 'bizarre', 'dolls', 'abruptly', 'poor', 'editing', 'reminiscent', 'early', ""'70s"", 'John', 'Waters.The', 'harpsichord', 'score', 'same', 'movies', 'hard', 'believe', 'was', 'released', '1979', 'score', 'something', 'decade', 'earlier.The', 'plot', '25-year-old', 'Amanda', 'who', 'anonymous', 'phone', 'call', 'return', 'Grandmother', 'house', 'old', 'woman', 'danger', 'When', 'Grandma', 'comatose', 'shady', 'doctor', 'judge', 'museum', 'curator', 'squatting', 'large', 'old', 'house.We', 'see', 'flashback', 'where', '12-year-old', 'Amanda', 'who', 'different', 'adult', 'counterpart', 'possible', 'mother', 'bed', 'knifed', 'death', 'somehow', 'related', 'obscene', 'phone', 'receiving', 'Grandma', ""'re"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'how.And', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'more', 'questions', 'Why', 'was', 'Amanda', 'mother', 'killed', 'Why', 'are', 'town', 'doctor', 'judge', 'museum', 'owner', 'shady', 'What', 'do', 'have', 'invested', 'nonsense', 'What', 'motivation', 'how', 'tie', 'mother', 'murder', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'script', 'never', 'bothers', 'answer.As', 'Amanda', 'lead', 'actress', 'nasty', 'attitude', 'right', 'start', 'last', 'bit', 'movie', 'where', 'simply', 'angry', 'mode', 'insane', '.The', 'films', 'look', 'grainy', 'are', 'not', 'remastered', 'did', 'really', 'need', 'be', 'audio', 'very', 'low', 'original', 'trailers', 'films', 'are', 'only', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'included.Those', 'interested', 'cheap', ""'70s"", 'horror', 'may', 'want', 'seek', 'aside', 'few', 'choice', 'moments', 'Basement', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'disappointed']",N/A
