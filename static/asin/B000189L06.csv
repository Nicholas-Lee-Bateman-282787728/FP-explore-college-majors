Concert duration: 105 minutes long. The Concert has a Subtitles option in five languages but the subtitles are only when Stipe speaks to the crowd (eg introducing songs). There are no subtitles when they are singing (no lyrics as subtitles).* REM has been around for a while, and in this concert dvd they blend hit songs along with some rare and fan favorite songs, so please don't be disappointed if some of your favorite songs are not included. They could have easily made a 4-hour concert DVD and still not included everyone's favorites. They have so many good songs!* Bonus documentary: ""A Stirling performance"" , 38 minutes long, in 4x3 picture format. The documentary does not have any chapters, it's just one title/chapter. The documentary also has a Subtitles option when people are speaking, but no subtitles for lyrics/songs. It chronicles the band's 1999 concert in Scotland at the Stirling Castle. It is a blend of behind the scenes footage and concert footage, but I would classify it as a music documentary of a concert (as opposed to a concert).",4,"Solid concert, can be enjoyed by everyone, not just REM fans!",1170633600,"02 5, 2007",2007,1312,"['concert', '16x9', 'anamorphic', 'picture', 'format', 'ideal', 'people', 'widescreen', 'nicely', '4:3', 'TVs', 'as', 'well', 'either', 'letterboxed', 'full-screen-but-cropped', 'edges', 'adjusting', 'tv', 'dvd', 'player', '26', 'chapters', '23', 'are', 'songs', 'Concert', 'duration', '105', 'minutes', 'long', 'Concert', 'Subtitles', 'option', 'five', 'languages', 'subtitles', 'are', 'only', 'when', 'Stipe', 'crowd', 'eg', 'introducing', 'songs', 'are', 'subtitles', 'when', 'are', 'singing', 'lyrics', 'subtitles', '*', 'REM', 'been', 'while', 'concert', 'dvd', 'blend', 'hit', 'songs', 'rare', 'fan', 'favorite', 'songs', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'favorite', 'songs', 'are', 'not', 'included', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'made', '4-hour', 'concert', 'DVD', 'still', 'not', 'included', 'everyone', 'favorites', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'songs', '*', 'Bonus', 'documentary', 'Stirling', 'performance', '38', 'minutes', 'long', '4x3', 'picture', 'format', 'documentary', 'not', 'have', 'chapters', 'just', 'one', 'title/chapter', 'documentary', 'also', 'Subtitles', 'option', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'speaking', 'subtitles', 'lyrics/songs', 'band', '1999', 'concert', 'Scotland', 'Stirling', 'Castle', 'blend', 'scenes', 'footage', 'concert', 'footage', 'would', 'classify', 'music', 'documentary', 'concert', 'opposed', 'concert']",N/A

(Some of them were selected by fans via their website, which was a feature throughout their recent tour.)  They even do a performance of &quot;Permamnent Vacation,&quot; which is a song about as old as the band that they haven't played for years, and was previously only available on old bootlegs of their earliest shows &amp; demos.  Beautiful shots of a beautiful location with excellent picture quality.  (Watch it with component video if you can, or, failing that, S-video -- WOW!  But, don't worry -- the composite video still looks very good, too.)  This is a huge leap forward from their disappointing Roadmovie, but not as classic as Tourfilm (but that'd be a tall order indeed!)  I would've liked to have the lyrics in the subtitles as they are with the Roadmovie DVD, but I consider that a pretty trivial complaint -- they probably didn't have the publishing rights lined up properly to do that.  (Besides, the Roadmovie subtitles often got the lyrics wrong, anyway!)  The bonus documentary is fun, too -- it documents their performances at a castle in the relatively small town of Stirling, Scotland during the Up tour, and the preparations for the shows.  Overall, you will NOT be disappointed with this concert film, as you might have been with Roadmovie (as I was).",5,"Way, way better than Roadmovie",1079481600,"03 17, 2004",2004,1392,"['Wonderful', 'show', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'song', 'selection', 'great', 'spanning', 'entire', 'career', 'were', 'selected', 'fans', 'website', 'was', 'feature', 'recent', 'tour', 'even', 'do', 'performance', 'quot', 'Permamnent', 'Vacation', 'quot', 'song', 'as', 'old', 'band', 'have', ""n't"", 'played', 'years', 'was', 'previously', 'only', 'available', 'old', 'bootlegs', 'earliest', 'shows', 'amp', 'demos', 'Beautiful', 'shots', 'beautiful', 'location', 'excellent', 'picture', 'quality', 'component', 'video', 'can', 'failing', 'S-video', 'WOW', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'composite', 'video', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'too', 'huge', 'leap', 'forward', 'disappointing', 'Roadmovie', 'not', 'as', 'classic', 'Tourfilm', ""'d"", 'be', 'tall', 'order', 'indeed', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'have', 'lyrics', 'subtitles', 'are', 'Roadmovie', 'DVD', 'consider', 'pretty', 'trivial', 'complaint', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'publishing', 'rights', 'lined', 'up', 'properly', 'do', 'Roadmovie', 'subtitles', 'often', 'got', 'lyrics', 'wrong', 'anyway', 'bonus', 'documentary', 'fun', 'too', 'documents', 'performances', 'castle', 'relatively', 'small', 'town', 'Stirling', 'Scotland', 'Up', 'tour', 'preparations', 'shows', 'Overall', 'will', 'NOT', 'be', 'disappointed', 'concert', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Roadmovie', 'was']",N/A

794697,A1MV4I024S3THB,B000189L06,J. Fowler,"[2, 2]","This DVD is worth getting just for the intense versions of 'Walk Unafraid' and 'So fast, So Numb' that crush the album versions like a grape.  During most of the other songs, everyone seems like they're just kind of doing the old-timers tour, but on this one song it's like they pulled the safety off and shot it off for real.  It's not that their old quite yet.  Michael Stipe is energetic and even walks down off the stage near the safety barrier where the front row of fans eagerly greet him, arms outstretched. He's not crowd surfing or anything, but there's a nice connection there.  'Man on the Moon' was the song that seemed to hype the crowd up most.  My only major complaint about this DVD is the stock repetition of a camera shot that comes out of a fountain at the venue.  The first couple times this shot is repeated it's not so bad, but it gets really cheesy after that.Note:  This DVD contains footage from actually one concert and a half.  One is the concert film shot in Germany.  The 'half' is included in one of the DVD extras shot in Scotland as part of a documentary.  Unfortunately, the three dates shot for the documentary in Scotland lacks the same audio quality as the Germany show and most of it is chopped up. Would've been cool to get a little more from that bit in terms of performance.

Of course having not been back in Wiesbaden for about a half-century might have something to do with it, but this is the first time I have seen anything of the place other than hostages from Iran or soldiers from the Middle East being brought to the military hospital where I was born, so that was a nice little bonus.R.E.M. is doing an open air concert in the town of 270,000, located on right (north) bank of the Rhine River that serves as the capital of the Bundesland of Hesse in central Germany.  The thing that stands out about this DVD for me is that it sounds like an actual concert, which is not necessarily a good thing, because I often have a hard time understanding what is being sung at concerts.  Maybe I should have tried out some of the other audio options, but the sound was just not as crisp as I would have liked.  The cinematography is rather straightforward and sedate, especially compared to some of the other concert films I have seen recently (e.g., ""U2 Go Home: Live From Slane Castle"").So the chief attraction here ends up being the music (but do not expect to turn on the closed captioning to get the lyrics so you can sing along with Michael Stipe, because all you get out subtitles for his comments between songs).  The play list falls one short of two dozen songs, including what is presented as a pretty long encore, and covers the entire spectrum of R.E.M.'s catalog up to that point.  So you get the expected biggies (""Losing My Religion,"" ""Man on the Moon,"" and Everybody Hurts,"" complete with raised lighters), along with lesser known song like ""So Fast So Numb,"" and ones that go back to before the beginning in ""Permanent Vacation.""  Stipe keeps alluding to the group's website, which apparently was used to help put together the song selections for the concert.Stipe is still the one to watch on stage, but then Peter Buck and Mike Mills have never provided any competition in that regard (and even though Buck's playing calls attention to itself a couple of times, even if the camera is still focused on the guy singing most of the time).  There is no claim here that this is the best R.E.M. concert film, because it is not.  But seeing the boys from Athens perform is never going to be a waste of time.  The DVD also includes the mini-documentary ""Sterling Performance,"" which interviews the locals and the band before and after a trio of concerts R.E.M. played at Sterling Castle in July of 1999 (there are only brief clips of the band actually playing; you will get more shots of them setting up and taking down the stage).",4,What?

Recorded in Germany in 2003, the concert features plenty of hits (Man on the Moon, One I Love), some obscurities (Begin the Begin, Maps &amp; Legends) and some recent songs I hadn't paid enough attention to (Electrolite and Imitation of Life, which sounds like a lost classic)All three band members look like they're enjoying themselves, but the real focus is of course Michael Stipe. Stipe's in good spirits , interacting warmly with the crowd, and making you wonder why you stopped listening to this band. REM is a band that has been nothing but themselves for over 20 years, and this DVD shows they're still capable of rocking hard and making great new music.

The song selection is terrible. If there was a slow boring song on any of their albums, then they surely played it on here. I own the R.E.M. Road Movie DVD and I think the song selection on that DVD was way better (even though the quality of the DVD is worse) Other than the boring songs, once again I think the mix is off on this DVD. The music is over the singer, and you might as well forget the back up singer, you cant even hear him. Just listen to ""orange crush"".  The singer is also off key in the beginning of the DVD. The DVD lacks energy, as well as the band. What your left with is a more older, burnout, tired R.E.M. The DVD footage is amazing, the scenery and quality is the best aspect of the DVD. Final verdict: Great picture, muffle sound, drowned out vocals, unenthusiastic band, great scenery",2,"An older, tired R.E.M.",1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,934,"['Maybe', 'possible', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'big', 'R.E.M', 'fan', 'thought', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'boring', 'concert', 'song', 'selection', 'terrible', 'was', 'slow', 'boring', 'song', 'albums', 'then', 'surely', 'played', 'here', 'own', 'R.E.M', 'Road', 'Movie', 'DVD', 'think', 'song', 'selection', 'DVD', 'was', 'way', 'better', 'even', 'quality', 'DVD', 'worse', 'Other', 'boring', 'songs', 'once', 'again', 'think', 'mix', 'off', 'DVD', 'music', 'singer', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'forget', 'back', 'up', 'singer', 'cant', 'even', 'hear', 'Just', 'listen', 'orange', 'crush', 'singer', 'also', 'off', 'key', 'beginning', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'energy', 'as', 'well', 'band', 'What', 'left', 'more', 'older', 'burnout', 'tired', 'R.E.M', 'DVD', 'footage', 'amazing', 'scenery', 'quality', 'best', 'aspect', 'DVD', 'Final', 'verdict', 'Great', 'picture', 'muffle', 'sound', 'drowned', 'out', 'vocals', 'unenthusiastic', 'band', 'great', 'scenery']",N/A
