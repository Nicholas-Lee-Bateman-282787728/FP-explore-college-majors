If you make the mistake of buying this, you will hate this garbage.  Not only did i order the dvd but i downloaded it from itunes as well.  The copy on itunes will be deleted and the dvd will be re-gifted.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[15, 17]","Note: DVD run time lists 60 minutes, the concert actually runs approximately 83 minutes.I understand that comedy is subjective. Along with music, it is one of the harder categories of entertainment to judge because, oftentimes, it just comes down to a matter of taste. But comedy DVDs have an additional stigma that other DVD choices don't face. They have less replay value. If you are a fan of a particular comedian and you follow them, you have to expect that you will hear some material that they've used successfully in the past.  Margaret Cho is one of those comedians that I inherently like and have even seen live a couple of times, but over the years--her brand of humor has become a little too familiar.  She plays largely to a niche market and serves up precisely what is expected.Filmed before an Atlanta audience, her latest concert ""Cho Dependent"" (which aired on Showtime) covers the topics that you know it will--but Cho does try to keep things lively and unpredictable with some gross-out humor and musical interludes.  One of her topics is, of course, her stint on ""Dancing with the Stars"" which inevitably ties to her notorious feud with Bristol Palin.  Those that follow the incident will likely be amused by Cho's take, but it isn't much that she hasn't said in other public forums.  Much more effective, if somewhat unpleasant, are the instances when she crosses the line into tastelessness.  Perhaps the most infamous piece within the entire concert involves both Kelly Clarkson and the Olive Garden before it's over--and it is probably an image that I'll never be able to forget!  Then Cho serves up a couple of comedic songs.  Sometimes accompanied by her friend John Roberts (whose voice instantly clues you into the fact that he is Linda on Fox's Bob's Burgers), this segment is hit-or-miss.  While I thought one song was quite clever, another fell completely flat.Obviously, if you are a Margaret Cho fan--you're going to want to check this out.  While not everything in ""Cho Dependent"" was a smashing success for me, I did feel that it was a bit more unpredictable than her other more recent endeavors.  I laughed and I cringed, and I think Cho was definitely going for those reactions.  I know that Cho has a somewhat divided fan base--many love her and others absolutely abhor her.  If you like her, this is a solid set.  If you don't, I'm not sure why you're shopping this concert DVD because it certainly won't change your mind.  It's always good to see Cho, in my opinion, and this is a nice blend of fresh material AND familiar topics.
