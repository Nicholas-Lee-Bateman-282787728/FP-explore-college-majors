So.. I set out to find it on DVD and can't seem to get it anywhere. I read the reviews on this workout and thought this would probably be the closest thing to the original so I bought it. It has alot of the same moves that the original Tae Bo has, but it still isn't what I'm looking for. The original has an instructional part which demonstrates each move that you will be doing, followed by an 8 minute workout, a 20 minute workout, and an hour long workout. This DVD here only has an hour long workout and I was exhaused after 25 minutes! It's a great workout but I just can't seem to keep myself energized long enough for an hour long Tae Bo workout. So I'll keep looking for the &#34;original&#34; video and hopefully find it one day! So I can't review this DVD very properly considering I only done the first 25 minutes but it does have some of the moves that the original DVD has.",5,Great Tae Bo workout!,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,1032,"['started', 'doing', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'original', 'workout', 'VHS', 'tape', 'have', 'used', 'so', 'much', 'no', 'longer', 'So..', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'anywhere', 'read', 'reviews', 'workout', 'thought', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'closest', 'thing', 'original', 'bought', 'alot', 'same', 'moves', 'original', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'still', ""n't"", 'what', ""'m"", 'looking', 'original', 'instructional', 'part', 'move', 'will', 'be', 'doing', 'followed', '8', 'minute', 'workout', '20', 'minute', 'workout', 'hour', 'long', 'workout', 'DVD', 'here', 'only', 'hour', 'long', 'workout', 'was', 'exhaused', '25', 'minutes', 'great', 'workout', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'keep', 'energized', 'long', 'enough', 'hour', 'long', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'workout', 'So', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'looking', '34', 'original', '34', 'video', 'hopefully', 'find', 'one', 'day', 'So', 'ca', ""n't"", 'review', 'DVD', 'very', 'properly', 'considering', 'only', 'done', 'first', '25', 'minutes', 'have', 'moves', 'original', 'DVD']",N/A

I have a handful of some of Billy's other DVDs (some bootcamp ones, the amped series, cardio inferno, SOS...) and this is my new favorite.  He doesn't show off his moves while you march in place and he does pretty well on doing each side evenly (which he constantly does in others).  But he does continue to always say ""one more time!"" when it's really 2 or 3 more times but I think that is just Billy.  I really like how he jumps right into it and it is nonstop.  This is a great cardio workout and definitely not for beginners.  I feel so good during and after.  I will agree with some others in saying that the cool down bothers me a bit.  That's why I didn't give it 5 stars.  We go straight from a heart pounding, cardio move to slow tai chi then we have our palms together while he jabbers.  I just turn it off there then do my own cool down and stretching.

1359033,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B003QO8TNC,Colleen M. Schneider,"[1, 1]","Whew, this is Cardio....I find that cardio like running or basic drills are not my thing and as a daily exerciser it is important to me to have cardio that I find interesting and fun that I will do.  I really liked this dvd as the moves are simple and the pace does not let up, you are moving throughout the dvd.  You are doing kicks and punches and with this the core (stomach/back) is always held in so that you are engaging those muscles as well.  This makes a good all over workout for your upper & lower body as well as your abs.  The constant movement keeps you in a good cardio range for burning fat and keeping your heart rate up. I had my pedometer on when I did the workout and logged in approx. 4200 steps, or the approximate equivalent of two miles.  The dvd left me feeling (besides sweaty), energized and that I had accomplished something good for myself and my body.If there is any drawback to this dvd, it would be when he talks at the end about the story of Tae Bo.  I would have rather seen a section in the DVD where he could have introduced the workout and gave the history of how he created Tae Bo, but instead he has you listening to this at the end.  This is easily remedied by ending the dvd earlier, but I thought it was a strange place for him to talk about this.Overall, a good dvd, but you need to be used to doing quick paced cardio.  If you are more of a beginner I would either start with one of his more basic dvds or ignore the pace on this dvd and just do the steps at your own pace, even if that means fewer repetitions until you are up to speed. For those used to cardio it will give you a good all over workout.",5,A good cardio workout!,1294531200,"01 9, 2011",2011,1648,"['Whew', 'Cardio', '.I', 'find', 'cardio', 'running', 'basic', 'drills', 'are', 'not', 'thing', 'daily', 'exerciser', 'important', 'have', 'cardio', 'find', 'interesting', 'fun', 'will', 'do', 'really', 'liked', 'dvd', 'moves', 'are', 'simple', 'pace', 'not', 'let', 'up', 'are', 'moving', 'dvd', 'are', 'doing', 'kicks', 'punches', 'core', 'stomach/back', 'always', 'held', 'so', 'are', 'engaging', 'muscles', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'workout', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'as', 'well', 'abs', 'constant', 'movement', 'keeps', 'good', 'cardio', 'range', 'burning', 'fat', 'keeping', 'heart', 'rate', 'had', 'pedometer', 'when', 'did', 'workout', 'logged', 'approx', '4200', 'steps', 'approximate', 'equivalent', 'two', 'miles', 'dvd', 'left', 'feeling', 'sweaty', 'energized', 'had', 'accomplished', 'something', 'good', 'myself', 'body.If', 'drawback', 'dvd', 'would', 'be', 'when', 'end', 'story', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'seen', 'section', 'DVD', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'introduced', 'workout', 'gave', 'history', 'how', 'created', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'instead', 'listening', 'end', 'easily', 'remedied', 'ending', 'dvd', 'earlier', 'thought', 'was', 'strange', 'place', 'talk', 'this.Overall', 'good', 'dvd', 'need', 'be', 'used', 'doing', 'quick', 'paced', 'cardio', 'are', 'more', 'beginner', 'would', 'either', 'start', 'one', 'more', 'basic', 'dvds', 'ignore', 'pace', 'dvd', 'just', 'do', 'steps', 'own', 'pace', 'even', 'fewer', 'repetitions', 'are', 'up', 'speed', 'used', 'cardio', 'will', 'give', 'good', 'workout']",N/A

I loved this workout, it gives a non-stop cardio workout and that is what I was looking for, and I don't mind the constant counting.  He does talk a bit to much and it does have a few lapses...working one side more than the other...starting a new movement in the middle of the count for the previous one...but all in all I think this is a great workout if you want to get your heart rate up for a sustaned 45 minute period.  There is not much of a cooldown, but that is ok with me as I generally do yoga after all my workouts.  The moves are basic and the pace is fast.  I found that I am not constantly looking at the clock to see when the workout will be over, and that is a big deal for me as calorie burn is my prime objective.I recommend the workout to those who just want to burn a lot of calories and are not so concerned with what the people are doing in the background.",5,Great workout,1289779200,"11 15, 2010",2010,933,"['admit', 'am', 'new', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'not', 'new', 'kickboxing', 'loved', 'workout', 'non-stop', 'cardio', 'workout', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'constant', 'counting', 'talk', 'bit', 'much', 'have', 'few', 'lapses', 'working', 'one', 'side', 'more', 'other', 'starting', 'new', 'movement', 'middle', 'count', 'previous', 'one', 'think', 'great', 'workout', 'want', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'sustaned', '45', 'minute', 'period', 'not', 'much', 'cooldown', 'ok', 'generally', 'do', 'yoga', 'workouts', 'moves', 'are', 'basic', 'pace', 'fast', 'found', 'am', 'not', 'constantly', 'looking', 'clock', 'see', 'when', 'workout', 'will', 'be', 'big', 'deal', 'calorie', 'burn', 'prime', 'objective.I', 'recommend', 'workout', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'burn', 'lot', 'calories', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'concerned', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'doing', 'background']",N/A

It reminds me of the original Advanced Tae bo workout, however it is not as intense, which is why I am giving it four stars instead of five.For the reviewers that said they did not get a workout: You only get out what you put into a workout. So, if you push yourself hard and get low during the squatting movements and rotate your hips and body the way you should through the movements you will get a good workout. As in all workouts, it is easy to cheat by just going through the motions with little effort. But if you push it to the max, you will get results. I am a runner and in very good shape. If I can get a workout out of this video, anyone can. :-)This workout is not an hour, it is just under 50 minutes. Billy focuses on upper body during this video and I was actually a little sore throughout my arms the next day after doing the workout. I do wish there were a few more kick sequences to add some intensity. All in all it is a good workout and I have added it to my routine. It will keep your heart rate in the mid to upper ranges and will help to burn fat. It is not so intense that you will feel wiped out after. It will leave you feeling energized and ready to take on the day. Be prepared to sweat! And as in all of his workout's Billy does go on and on about how great Tae Bo is and how there are so many imitators out there and etc... I am able to tune people out pretty well, so I just focus on my workout and ignore his rants.Warning: At the end, Billy goes into the story of how he created Tae Bo while having you hold a low sumo squat. It is neat to hear his story the first time, but it does get old...I just get as low as I can and hold the squat while I tune him out. He does this after the cool down so you could stop the DVD before his rant if you wanted to.",4,A solid cardio routine,1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,1829,"['Tae', 'bo', 'decent', 'cardio', 'workout', 'original', 'Advanced', 'Tae', 'bo', 'workout', 'however', 'not', 'intense', 'why', 'am', 'giving', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five.For', 'reviewers', 'said', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'workout', 'only', 'get', 'out', 'what', 'put', 'workout', 'So', 'push', 'hard', 'get', 'low', 'squatting', 'movements', 'rotate', 'hips', 'body', 'way', 'should', 'movements', 'will', 'get', 'good', 'workout', 'workouts', 'easy', 'cheat', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'little', 'effort', 'push', 'max', 'will', 'get', 'results', 'am', 'runner', 'very', 'good', 'shape', 'can', 'get', 'workout', 'video', 'anyone', 'can', 'workout', 'not', 'hour', 'just', '50', 'minutes', 'Billy', 'upper', 'body', 'video', 'was', 'actually', 'little', 'sore', 'arms', 'next', 'day', 'doing', 'workout', 'do', 'wish', 'were', 'few', 'more', 'kick', 'sequences', 'add', 'intensity', 'good', 'workout', 'have', 'added', 'routine', 'will', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'mid', 'upper', 'ranges', 'will', 'help', 'burn', 'fat', 'not', 'so', 'intense', 'will', 'feel', 'wiped', 'out', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'energized', 'ready', 'take', 'day', 'Be', 'prepared', 'sweat', 'workout', 'Billy', 'go', 'how', 'great', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'how', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'imitators', 'there', 'etc', 'am', 'able', 'tune', 'people', 'out', 'pretty', 'well', 'just', 'focus', 'workout', 'ignore', 'rants.Warning', 'end', 'Billy', 'story', 'how', 'created', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'having', 'hold', 'low', 'sumo', 'squat', 'neat', 'hear', 'story', 'first', 'time', 'get', 'old', 'just', 'get', 'as', 'low', 'can', 'hold', 'squat', 'tune', 'out', 'cool', 'down', 'so', 'could', 'stop', 'DVD', 'rant', 'wanted']",N/A

First, this was MUCH better than the Amped Up DVD, which was fun but not challenging and pretty much a sales pitch for the bar aka ""the amplifier."" I really like the energy of the Tae Bo workouts. I like that the other people on the DVDs are not smiley happy Barbie dolls, and I generally really like Billy's energy and direction. I would prefer a little less start slow then move to fast, as after the first time through the whole dvd, I've pretty much got a handle on it and am ready to move into the faster paced stuff. But I do like that this workout in particular is focused mostly on upper body and a pretty good cardio once you get going. What I really, really DON'T like, which bears mentioning even though others have said it, is when Billy stops the workout to drone on AD NAUSEUM about how HE created this and how others have copied him. The cool down period during which everyone stands in prayer prose while Billy talks about himself for two minutes is truly ridiculous. Narcissistic much, Billy? The whole dvd is marred by this. When he stopped the workout and left the exercisers doing the moves slowly the first time while he jabbered on, I got very annoyed. He's forgetting that this is not an infomercial, and the editors are really to blame. They should edit that part out and let us move on. But the ""cool down"" is the worst. I can't even tell you what he says for the final 1.5 minutes. I stop it after 30 seconds.  I'll do this one till I have to turn it back in to the library, but I won't buy a Tae Bo till I find one that is both challenging and doesn't have Billy talking it up as though he has to use his sales skills to convince people that it's a good workout.",3,ALMOST 4 stars,1293667200,"12 30, 2010",2010,1765,"['checked', 'out', 'library', 'almost', 'always', 'do', 'buying', 'First', 'was', 'MUCH', 'better', 'Amped', 'Up', 'DVD', 'was', 'fun', 'not', 'challenging', 'pretty', 'much', 'sales', 'pitch', 'bar', 'aka', 'amplifier', 'really', 'energy', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'like', 'other', 'people', 'DVDs', 'are', 'not', 'smiley', 'happy', 'Barbie', 'dolls', 'generally', 'really', 'Billy', 'energy', 'direction', 'would', 'prefer', 'little', 'less', 'start', 'slow', 'then', 'move', 'fast', 'first', 'time', 'whole', 'dvd', ""'ve"", 'pretty', 'much', 'got', 'handle', 'am', 'ready', 'move', 'faster', 'paced', 'stuff', 'do', 'workout', 'particular', 'focused', 'mostly', 'upper', 'body', 'pretty', 'good', 'cardio', 'once', 'get', 'going', 'What', 'really', 'really', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'like', 'mentioning', 'even', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'when', 'Billy', 'workout', 'drone', 'AD', 'NAUSEUM', 'how', 'HE', 'created', 'how', 'others', 'have', 'copied', 'cool', 'down', 'period', 'everyone', 'prayer', 'prose', 'Billy', 'talks', 'two', 'minutes', 'truly', 'ridiculous', 'Narcissistic', 'much', 'Billy', 'whole', 'dvd', 'marred', 'When', 'stopped', 'workout', 'left', 'exercisers', 'doing', 'moves', 'slowly', 'first', 'time', 'jabbered', 'got', 'very', 'annoyed', 'forgetting', 'not', 'infomercial', 'editors', 'are', 'really', 'blame', 'should', 'edit', 'part', 'let', 'move', 'cool', 'down', 'worst', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'tell', 'what', 'final', '1.5', 'minutes', 'stop', '30', 'seconds', ""'ll"", 'do', 'one', 'till', 'have', 'turn', 'back', 'library', 'wo', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'till', 'find', 'one', 'challenging', ""n't"", 'have', 'Billy', 'talking', 'up', 'use', 'sales', 'skills', 'convince', 'people', 'good', 'workout']",N/A

At the end during the meditation phase and him talking I totally skip that and use that time for my stretching and cooldown time.Things I love about this video:1)Front Kicks with Lundges2)Front kicks with Back kicks3)4 knees with 4 uppercuts4)Burnout at the end punches and Knee lifts.Things I don't like about this video:1)He works the arms pretty heavy.,5,Pretty good!,1321574400,"11 18, 2011",2011,790,"['have', 'Ripped', 'Extreme', 'DvD', 'very', 'good', 'wanted', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'weights', 'bands', 'so', 'bought', 'workout', 'DvD', 'try', 'out', 'pretty', 'good', 'moving', 'thats', 'sure', 'Doing', 'workout', 'first', 'couple', 'times', 'messed', 'up', 'transitions', 'stuff', 'got', 'used', 'dripping', 'sweat', 'when', ""'m"", 'finished', 'video', 'talk', 'bit', 'focus', 'what', 'doing', 'quickly', 'end', 'meditation', 'phase', 'talking', 'totally', 'skip', 'use', 'time', 'stretching', 'cooldown', 'time.Things', 'love', 'video:1', 'Front', 'Kicks', 'Lundges2', 'Front', 'Back', 'kicks3', '4', 'knees', '4', 'uppercuts4', 'Burnout', 'end', 'punches', 'Knee', 'lifts.Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'video:1', 'arms', 'pretty', 'heavy']",N/A

1359045,AF5UQTD0NQNKL,B003QO8TNC,S. Perkins,"[5, 9]","I purchased this at Target, and thought I would give it a try since I really like the other Tae Bo videos I have done (notably ""Get Ripped""). It was ok. The workout was pretty good, there are some moves I like, and some good kick and punch combos. I also liked the isometric arm exercises. He introduces each combo really well, so it is easy to follow.What I did not like is the constant counting throughout the whole video. All the people are counting all the time. I know this is done in the other Tae Bo videos too, but this was more annoying because there was just no stop to it. Billy goes into this whole tirade about how other people have copied his method. The worst is at the end, when we are supposed to be ""meditating"", and he instead tells the history of Tae Bo (interesting, but not the best place for it. Maybe it could have been a bonus feature?), and talks about how so many others have tried to copy him.And then there is no stretching at all. That was very unfortunate, especially in a workout with so much kicking. I also thought there might be some abs, but no.Overall, I was dissapointed. It wasn't as tough as I'd expected, maybe more of a beginner workout.",3,"Not the best Tae Bo, bit of sour grapes from Billy",1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,1179,"['purchased', 'Target', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'try', 'really', 'other', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'videos', 'have', 'done', 'notably', 'Get', 'Ripped', 'was', 'ok', 'workout', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'moves', 'like', 'good', 'kick', 'punch', 'combos', 'also', 'liked', 'isometric', 'arm', 'exercises', 'combo', 'really', 'well', 'easy', 'follow.What', 'did', 'not', 'like', 'constant', 'counting', 'whole', 'video', 'people', 'are', 'counting', 'time', 'know', 'done', 'other', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'videos', 'too', 'was', 'more', 'annoying', 'was', 'just', 'stop', 'Billy', 'whole', 'tirade', 'how', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'copied', 'method', 'worst', 'end', 'when', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'meditating', 'instead', 'history', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'interesting', 'not', 'best', 'place', 'Maybe', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bonus', 'feature', 'talks', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'tried', 'copy', 'him.And', 'then', 'stretching', 'was', 'very', 'unfortunate', 'especially', 'workout', 'so', 'much', 'kicking', 'also', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'abs', 'no.Overall', 'was', 'dissapointed', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'tough', ""'d"", 'expected', 'maybe', 'more', 'beginner', 'workout']",N/A

On my very first workout I did about 15 minutes of the tape. The next day, I was determined to get through the entire tape even if it killed me. I did get through the entire tape with slower modifications. At times, I worked at my own pace. Now, I'm almost up to the pace of Billy Blanks and his crew.I count the calories burned when doing this workout and I burn an average of 551-600 calories.

It's a combination of a lot of movies on fast paced music. Reminded me of Celebrity Fit dvd but with the pace of Ripped Extreme.The warm up is all on your feet, unlike most of his dvds which I like. The crew is off the beat some times but I can ignore that. There isn't too much talking from Billy and when he does, the workout continues.It covers everything. Top, mid and lower body. Pretty much total body Cardio that's a lot of fun. The video is 47 minutes of continuous fun movies, most from all the videos I already have. Then 3 minutes of cool down. The rest is about 10 minutes of tutorial. When I was done, I. Was all soaked in sweat! This is a fun video. It's intense workout that doesn't feel like work out.Love this!I wish Billy knew how much he has changed lives like mine. Am one of those pple who hate work out.
