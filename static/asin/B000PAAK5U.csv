The next day, the plot was in my mind, which rarely happens with other things I watch. That tells me these were masterfully done and did what they were intended to do. They made me think. The ending is never what I thought it might be. The characters are played by actors' actors.I can see that back before we all spent so much time in front of our televisions, the slow pace would have been appropriate, even necessary.

Juliet Stevenson plays Nora so naturally, allowing the character to slowly emerge for the viewer, just as I think Henrik Ibsen intended.  Ibsen's intentions aside, she is definitely the Nora audiences deserve.  Beautiful!  Brilliant!  She has never really received the recognition she has deserved, and her performance in this film proves it.  The other works are admirable, most of them stunning, all of them worthwhile, but I must say ""A Doll's House"" came to life for me as never before, thanks to some great performances.

1069381,A3D7DZ37FLKFED,B000PAAK5U,melquist,"[6, 8]","I am very pleased with this collection.  The performances are outstanding and the discs are loaded with extras, including a full 2.5 hour radio broadcast of Peer Gynt with Grieg's music.  The price is also unbeatable.  However, I am always amazed that Ibsen gets loads of attention while Strindberg (a better writer and dramatist) gets hardly any.  Perhaps it's because he was branded a sexist.  True, he had problems with women; but anyone who knows A Dream Play and many other works would conclude that this brand is too simplistic to warrant such a dismissal.  Aside from this, I really have a great admiration for Ibsen.  Included in this collection are his greatest plays.  Ghosts is his best tragedy.  Ibsen proved that he could present a dark and disturbing work without violence or death.  It is also a major condemnation of social zombies, who are concerned more with the herd than with each other's individual needs.  Even though I liked A Doll's House, I enjoyed Lady from the Sea better.  Here, the stereotypical gender roles are not as noticeable, and the character development takes on a more primary concern.  The Wild Duck is his most heartbreaking play, showing the tragic results from neglecting children.  Similarly, Little Eyolf deals with the neglect of children.  This tragedy takes a close second to Ghost with its strong sense of devastation that condemns the surviving characters to a gloomy existence.  All in all, it is a very nice collection, but I sincerely wish BBC would honor Strindberg as well.",5,"Nice, but a Strindberg collection would be nicer.",1235001600,"02 19, 2009",2009,1527,"['am', 'very', 'pleased', 'collection', 'performances', 'are', 'outstanding', 'discs', 'are', 'loaded', 'extras', 'including', 'full', '2.5', 'hour', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'Peer', 'Gynt', 'Grieg', 'music', 'price', 'also', 'unbeatable', 'However', 'am', 'always', 'amazed', 'Ibsen', 'loads', 'attention', 'Strindberg', 'better', 'writer', 'dramatist', 'hardly', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'branded', 'sexist', 'True', 'had', 'problems', 'women', 'anyone', 'who', 'Dream', 'Play', 'many', 'other', 'works', 'would', 'conclude', 'brand', 'too', 'simplistic', 'warrant', 'dismissal', 'Aside', 'really', 'have', 'great', 'admiration', 'Ibsen', 'Included', 'collection', 'are', 'greatest', 'plays', 'Ghosts', 'best', 'tragedy', 'Ibsen', 'proved', 'could', 'present', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'work', 'violence', 'death', 'also', 'major', 'condemnation', 'social', 'zombies', 'who', 'are', 'concerned', 'more', 'herd', 'other', 'individual', 'needs', 'Even', 'liked', 'A', 'Doll', 'House', 'enjoyed', 'Lady', 'Sea', 'better', 'Here', 'stereotypical', 'gender', 'roles', 'are', 'not', 'noticeable', 'character', 'development', 'more', 'primary', 'concern', 'Wild', 'Duck', 'most', 'heartbreaking', 'play', 'showing', 'tragic', 'results', 'neglecting', 'children', 'Similarly', 'Little', 'Eyolf', 'deals', 'neglect', 'children', 'tragedy', 'close', 'second', 'Ghost', 'strong', 'sense', 'devastation', 'surviving', 'characters', 'gloomy', 'existence', 'very', 'nice', 'collection', 'sincerely', 'wish', 'BBC', 'would', 'honor', 'Strindberg', 'as', 'well']",Henrik Ibsen Collection: (Hedda Gabler / Ghosts / Little Eyolf / The Wild Duck / The Master Builder)
