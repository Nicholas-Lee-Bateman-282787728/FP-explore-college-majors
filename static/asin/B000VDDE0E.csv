1100826,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B000VDDE0E,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[10, 11]","Beverly Hills, 90210 - The Complete Third Season is the best and most fun of the 10 seasons of this groundbreaking show. I love the love triangle between Dylan, Brenda, and Kelly. Every character also comes into their own including David and Donna. You can really feel the magic and excitement in season 3. My favorite episode is when Kelly's addiction to diet pills goes to far and she passes out at The Peach Pit on the eve of her 18th birthday. I also love the episode where the gang spend senior ditch day at Magic Mountain. If you were to get just one season of this show, season 3 is the one to get, it is so good I could watch each episode 10 billion times and never get sick of it. So don't wait reserve your copy today, it's a great Christmas gift.",5,The best season by far!,1189382400,"09 10, 2007",2007,757,"['Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'Complete', 'Third', 'Season', 'best', 'most', 'fun', '10', 'seasons', 'groundbreaking', 'show', 'love', 'love', 'triangle', 'Dylan', 'Brenda', 'Kelly', 'Every', 'character', 'also', 'own', 'including', 'David', 'Donna', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'magic', 'excitement', 'season', '3', 'favorite', 'episode', 'when', 'Kelly', 'addiction', 'diet', 'pills', 'far', 'out', 'Peach', 'Pit', 'eve', '18th', 'birthday', 'also', 'love', 'episode', 'where', 'gang', 'spend', 'senior', 'ditch', 'day', 'Magic', 'Mountain', 'were', 'get', 'just', 'one', 'season', 'show', 'season', '3', 'one', 'get', 'so', 'good', 'could', 'watch', '10', 'billion', 'times', 'never', 'get', 'sick', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'wait', 'reserve', 'copy', 'today', 'great', 'Christmas', 'gift']",N/A
1100827,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B000VDDE0E,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Drama has reached an all-time high in Season Three of Beverly Hills 90210. The episodes have been addicting to watch only up to a certain point, and then there were some pretty boring episodes because the lingering issues such as Brenda's spat with Kelly were tiresome and not worth caring about. Three characters I really thought developed the most during this season were: Steve Sanders, Kelly Taylor, and Nat Bussichio. Steve gets the most props, and I've grown to like his character notwithstanding his incredible array of character faults. Yet he has become a very likable person with a winning smile. Kelly Taylor, seeing how far she has come, remains a very insecure person, and although she seems intelligent about herself, she can be naive at times. Nat, warm as usual, gets his role expanded and becomes a part of everybody's life. On the other hand, Brenda's presence is annoying as ever, and her useless spats with everybody else are breathtakingly mindless and juvenile. I just can't wait for her to be gone after Season Four when I get to there. I am surprised at Dyan's naivety when it came to his relationship with his father and how he was willing to fork over ten million dollars. Anyone could have spotted the scam a mile away, but to be honest with him, he doesn't deserve to have the money because it was stolen from other people. Now, I was watching the episode ""Destiny Rides Again"" where Andrea Zuckerman was run over by a silver car with license plate 2FAN321. I mentally made sure of it, and then when David Arquette's (nice work, by the way) character showed up with his car  which was blue in color showing license plate 2FAN321 in ""Wild Horses,"" I immediately thought that was him that did the hit-and-run. I thought it was a missed opportunity for Brandon to spot that even though he didn't know the plate number. After that episode was over, I thought the matter was dropped, and everything was forgotten. However, in the episode ""The Game is Chicken"" (which was one of the, if not the, best episode of Season Three), the silver car doesn't show a license plate in the front of the car where in the other episode of the hit-and-run showed that in the front. It might sound ridiculous, but this is pretty bad. Anyway, there is a nice cameo by Burt Reynolds in a later episode. In the second half of the season, I thought the series was losing a lot of momentum and dragged a lot for me with a few nice episodes thrown in. Also, I felt how egocentric the group had become because it seemed to me that the lead cast appeared to be the masters and the mistresses of the universe when it came to their high school setting. The feeling was very apparent in during senior poll and senior breakfast day: it was just all Brandon, Andrea, Donna, Kelly, Steve, David, Brenda, and Dylan (not really). It was nauseating for me to watch, and I was thinking of the possibility of the others in the background being so sick of the clique. I am glad high school is over, and now, we can move onto college in the next season. Hopefully, there won't be too much of group's egocentricity. It is even worse to notice that how friendless most characters are outside of their clique because they must have had friends already that they grew up with before Brandon and Brenda moved into Beverly Hills. This issue needs to be worked out more. Meanwhile, I liked how the writers have made some of the old characters to come back for nostalgia, and they work very well. However, I was surprised that David didn't realize Nikki the second time around because that was her that he invited along with her two friends over his grandparents' house in Palm Springs from Season One. Another surprising thing was that Andrea actually supported horse racing when it should have been obvious that horses are abused. Nonetheless, she showed proficiency when it came to American Sign Language, and she looked that she knew it well through experience. Brandon just added a couple more to his evergrowing list of vices: gambling (horse racing, basketball, and illegal drag racing) and bullying. It's amazing, at his age, he is probably the biggest womanizer of West Beverly Hills High yet pretends to maintain the Boy's Scout image. There was a moment where he broke up with Brooke from the summer due to her racism, but was Brandon already a racist when he assumed that the black basketball players were cheating their way through? During the prom episode, I was thinking how dumb everybody must be when they could have taken Donna to the room that David had rented in the hotel instead of going the long way, that is, presumably to Kelly's house. All in all, I hope the next season will be better than this one because it wasn't strong enough to sustain my interest throughout.",4,Not Strong As Previous Two Seasons Yet The Most

I want my Brenda-TV!!Why is Shannen Doherty such a compelling and provocative superstar...?More than fifteen years before Paris, Britney and trampy Lohan burst onto the Hollywood scene, Shannen was already a household name. Shannen became one of the hardest working women in Tinseltown because of her strong work ethic and sheer determination to excel at everything she stamped her good name on.Today, Shannen has arguably become one of the most famed American actresses. But, in the late '70's and early '80s she was just an unknown child actor. Shannen got her big break onFather Murphy, playing Drusilla Shannon on Merlin Olsen's hit family-friendly series. A year later, Shannen again garnered critical-acclaim on another wholesome program; as Jenny Wilder in the modern-classic that isLittle House on the Prairie. In fact, Michael Landon was so impressed with Shannen's acting and professional demeanor that he invited her to appear in theLittle House TV movieseven after the series was canceled!In 1985 Shannen stared in the cult-classic,Girls Just Want to Have Fun. This was one of Shannen's first roles as a teen which also garnered her coast-to-coast exposure as a film actress. A couple of years later, Shannen was cast opposite two of the biggest teen stars (Christian Slater and Winona Ryder) of the '80s in one of the biggest teen movies of the '80s. Of course I'm talking about none other thanHeathers!In ""Heathers"" Shannen played Heather Duke, a stuck-up girl that was only interested in being as snobbish as possible. The same year that ""Heathers"" came out, Shannen also shot the pilot for a new TV series, originally titledClass Beverly HillsA year later, Shannen's series was picked up and retooled. This time, the series was called90210. Shannen portrayed the star of the show, kind-hearted Brenda Walsh. Brenda was actually a lot like Shannen. She was sweet, beautiful and very intelligent. And, most of all, she (both Shannen and Brenda!) didn't take garbage from anyone!Throughout four Seasons we all watched Shannen on ""90210"" as she grew up into a young woman. As anyone who was a child of the '90s knows, ""90210"" was a huge worldwide sensation. And this was all thanks to Shannen! After the first season of ""90210"" Shannen became a bona fide star!Shannen also more than helped put the fledging Fox Network on the map. Prior to ""90210,"" this network was simply known as an obscure TV station that more than 60% of the country did not receive! Once Shannen made ""90210"" a hit, Fox executives rolled out a ""90210"" spin-off in the summer of '92;Melrose Place! And less than two years later, ""90210"" which begat ""Melrose,"" begat ""Models!"" Although, Shannen refused to appear in any eps on either of those shows.In 1993 Shannen shocked everyone when she eloped at the last minute with Ashley Hamilton. Everyone was shocked, but mostly, the Material Girl was seething, when she complained to MTV about being pushed off the cover of People Magazine so that they can make room for Shannen Doherty! A week later, newlywed Shannen went on Saturday Night Live, which received some of the highest ratings, ever!Unbeknownst to Shannen, in the Winter of '94 nude photos of Shannen for an Aids awareness-campaign were published in a men's magazine, without her approval. When a reporter asked Shannen what Mr. Spelling would say about this, Shannen simply said, ""ask me if I care!""Shannen also stared in the blockbuster thriller, aptly titled ""Blindfold."" In this feature film, Shannen played sexy Madeleine Dalton in one of her most diverse and talked-about movie roles ever! This film also helped cement Shannen's role as a true actress with completely unique talent. Because the role she was cast in was the total opposite of Brenda Walsh!In early '94 there was another controversy when E! News broke the story! Shannen was leaving ""90210!"" She specifically asked her producers to let her out of her contract. Shannen gave cryptic hints as to why she was leaving the series that she helped build.Industry-insiders intimated that Shannen wanted out of the series for a two-fold reason. First, she couldn't relate to any of the other performers because most of them were all much older than her; by now, most of them were all in their twenties or thirties! And, Shannen also wanted to leave the series because, unlike the rest of the cast, she was an actual actress!Never one to be typecast, Shannen portrayed the famed novalist, Margaret Mitchell, airing a few months after her lest ep of ""90210"" aired, in the Fall of '94. The movie, ""A Burning Passion: The Margaret Mitchell Story"" became an instant hit! It was also around this time that Shannen yet again made headlines when she proclaimed that she was just a ""misunderstood, sweet, Southern Baptist girl!""The following year, Shannen stared in the major motion picture, ""Mallrats,"" opposite Ben Affleck. Shannen played Rene Mosier in this cult-classic comedy. And, Ben Affleck's character's name was a homage to Shannen!Over the next few years, from '95 to '98, Shannen appeared in a variety of movies, such as: ""Gone in the Night,"" ""Friends 'Til the End,"" ""Ticket"" and ""Nowhere."" These films all afforded Shannen some of the best reviews of her entire career! It was also around this time that Shannen caught the attention of a very unlikely individual.Mr. Aaron Spelling invited Shannen to consider the role of Prue Halliwell in the then-untitled series. Of course by now, we all know this was the hugely successful drama, ""Charmed."" The producers of this show lucked out when Shannen chose to sign on!Unlike ""90210,"" ""Charmed"" was science fiction, which was a totally new genre for Shannen. But Shannen totally fell in love with her new role and in fact stayed with the series for three years! Shannen even purchased a portion of the show! In 2001 Shannen experienced deja vu when the MSM reported that she was quiting another hit Spelling-series. This time Shannen kept mum as to why she was leaving, only saying that it was time to leave!The producers of ""90210"" tried their hardest to get Shannen to come back for the series finale, but Shannen was much too busy to even consider such a fruitless project. She did consider letting the producers use images of herself from prior clips in their retrospective show, but then decided against it when no one could come to terms. (FYI: That's why Shannen doesn't appear as Brenda Walsh in any of the clips that are shown in the ""90210"" retrospective, this ep aired prior to the series finale!)After leaving ""Charmed,"" Shannen hosted the much-anticipated hidden camera series, ""Scare Tactics."" It also goes without saying that Shannen also appeared in a variety of other first-rate movies, such as: ""View of Terror,"" ""Another Day"" and ""Hell on Heels: The Battle of Mary Kay.""In 2006 Shannen got her own series on the Oxygen Network, ""Breaking Up with Shannen Doherty."" In this reality program, Shannen joined forces with people in relationship peril who wanted to have a little fun! In the summer of '06, Shannen appeared on Babs' ""View"" as a guest co-host. During the second segment (while interviewing Kristin Davis,) Elizabeth said to everyone, ""this is such a surreal moment for someone my age, I'm sitting next to Brenda and Brooke!"" EH, I can imagine just what you mean!!!What's next for Shannen? She will be staring in the upcoming movie, ""Defuct."" Look for this movie in March of this year! And, Shannen just wrapped ""Kiss Me Deadly;"" a suspense-drama that will be out later this year!Hate her...? ...Love her? Or, do you just love to hate her? Whatever you feel about Shannen, you can't deny that for nearly thirty years she has been a pop-culture phenomenon! And, unlike today's panjandrums Shannen never went kooky and has true talent!",5,The Brenda Show,1188172800,"08 27, 2007",2007,10643,"['Brenda', 'Donna', 'spend', 'summer', 'France', 'Brenda', 'be',

Despite the Kelly factor, this season contains some fantastic episodes. Donna and Brenda spend a hilarious summer in Paris, while the rest of the gang chills at the Beverly Hills Beach Club, and Dylan and Kelly get a little too close for comfort back home. When senior year kicks off in the fall, there's major tension between Dylan and the two women in his life. Also, Steve gets into some serious trouble at school, Andrea worries about how she'll afford Ivy-League college tuition, David and Donna contemplate taking their relationship to the next level, and Kelly and David watch their parents' marriage fall apart. The best episodes this season revolve around Dylan's relationship with his father, which has major highs and lows until tragedy strikes. Overall, it's a great season, and I'm thrilled to own it on DVD.",5,"Dylan, what is wrong with you?!

Steve breaks into the school, and tries to change his grades, and gets' caught. Donna and David are together, and run the morning Dj show together. Brandon starts gambling and gets into hot water, and Nat from the peach pit bails him out. Season 3 is also all about the DYLAN, BRENDA, KELLY Triangle that starts when Brenda is in Paris w/Donna over the summer. Brenda meets a guy in paris, and pretends to be french. When she breaks up with Dylan, after months of lying, Kelly and Dylan run right into each other's arms. I hated when Dylan goes for Kelly. They were all wrong for each other! You feel so bad for Brenda when this happens. Dylan's father estranged father makes a return to the show, when he is released from prison. Dylan starts spending alot of time with his father, trying to make up for lost time, and working on getting the money out of his trust fund. Mr. Walsh tries to protect Dylan, and then Dylan's father is actually in a horrible accident, when his car blows. Andrea has a topsy turvey relationship with her teacher Mr. Myers, when he tries to appoint Brandon as the new editor of the school paper. Brenda goes to the prom with football star, Tony Miller and turns him down when he proposes they get a hotel room. Donna gets drunk at the prom, and get's caught, and suspended from graduating. The whole gang gets together, with the rest of the school and marches the school board protesting ""DONNA MARTIN GRADUATES"". Donna is let off the hook, and the whole class graduates, and tries to decide what they will do with there lives. Brenda contemplates going back home to school, Andrea battles with her decision to go to Yale, and Dylan wants to go to Berkley- like his father wanted.

I was a sophmore in high school when they were, at the shows start, and we were the same age and we grew up together. I watched (and taped) every episode for the whole 10 years... but those VHS tapes wear out, so imagine my joy when the DVD set came out... or not...As I said, I have taped every episode, and I watch it now on Soapnet... and as you know like watching your favorite movie over and over, you can ""talk along with the movie""... well I am that way with this show. I now know (but didn't until after having bought the first 2 seasons) that the box says in fine print on the back of the box that ""MUSIC HAS BEEN CHANGED FOR THIS HOME ENTERTAINMENT VERSION. SOME EPISODES MAY BE EDITED FROM THEIR ORIGINAL NETWORK VERSIONS."", but come on!!! I noticed a wierd edit in another season episode and a spot here and there, not to mention in season one when all the girls have a slumber party and are signing along to ""Mony Mony"" but now the music is different... but The Senior Prom episode was seriously butchered! There were major parts gone... not to mention Cathy Dennis sang 2 songs at the prom and they cut the whole second song out, along with shots of her and most of the actors lines that were said during that song. I am very disappointed in this. The prom episode was a great one, not to mention a pivital part of the season. Part of the greatness of 90210 was the fact that they used new, up to date music for every episode.Come on FOX... how cheap are you? We are all paying $40 or more for a set that probably costs $5 to make... You couldn't shell out some cash to keep this amazingly cool show intact in it's original condition??? And what are you going to do in future seasons??? There were tons of episodes later on in the Peach Pit After Dark where a famous music group plays there... are those hour long episodes going to be edited down to a half hour show?So, before you start sending me hate email, let me say this:My review comes to this = Yes, I love the show and Yes, I have and probably will buy every season on DVD. But Yes, I am disappointed in the editing. So to all of you die hard fans like me... be aware of this before you buy and watch it, so you aren't completly disappointed like I was when I first bought and watched them. Maybe they will get this figured out and stop their ""editing"" or ""ruining"" our favorite show!!!",4,Love the show... but the dvd set???,1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,2466,"['Ok', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'negative', 'show', 'traitor', 'generation', 'love', 'Bev', 'Hills', '90210', 'was', 'sophmore', 'high', 'school', 'when', 'were', 'shows', 'start', 'were', 'same', 'age', 'grew', 'up', 'together', 'watched', 'taped', 'episode', 'whole', '10', 'years', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'wear', 'out', 'so', 'imagine', 'joy', 'when', 'DVD', 'set', 'came', 'out', 'not', 'said', 'have', 'taped', 'episode', 'watch', 'now', 'Soapnet', 'know', 'watching', 'favorite', 'movie', 'can', 'talk', 'movie', 'well', 'am', 'way', 'show', 'now', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'having', 'bought', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'box', 'fine', 'print', 'back', 'box', 'MUSIC', 'HAS', 'BEEN', 'CHANGED', 'FOR', 'THIS', 'HOME', 'ENTERTAINMENT', 'VERSION', 'SOME', 'EPISODES', 'MAY', 'BE', 'EDITED', 'FROM', 'THEIR', 'ORIGINAL', 'NETWORK', 'VERSIONS', 'come', 'noticed', 'wierd', 'edit', 'season', 'episode', 'spot', 'here', 'there', 'not', 'mention', 'season', 'one', 'when', 'girls', 'have', 'slumber', 'party', 'are', 'signing', 'along', 'Mony', 'Mony', 'now', 'music', 'different', 'Senior', 'Prom', 'episode', 'was', 'seriously', 'butchered', 'were', 'major', 'parts', 'gone', 'not', 'mention', 'Cathy', 'Dennis', 'sang', '2', 'songs', 'prom', 'cut', 'whole', 'second', 'song', 'out', 'shots', 'most', 'actors', 'lines', 'were', 'said', 'song', 'am', 'very', 'disappointed', 'prom', 'episode', 'was', 'great', 'one', 'not', 'mention', 'pivital', 'part', 'season', 'Part', 'greatness', '90210', 'was', 'fact', 'used', 'new', 'up', 'date', 'music', 'episode.Come', 'FOX', 'how', 'cheap', 'are', 'are', 'paying', '40', 'more', 'set', 'probably', '5', 'make', 'could', ""n't"", 'shell', 'out', 'cash', 'keep', 'amazingly', 'cool', 'show', 'intact', 'original', 'condition', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'future', 'seasons', 'were', 'tons', 'episodes', 'later', 'Peach', 'Pit', 'Dark', 'where', 'famous', 'music', 'group', 'are', 'hour', 'long', 'going', 'be', 'edited', 'down', 'half', 'hour', 'show', 'So', 'start', 'sending', 'hate', 'email', 'let', 'say', 'review', '=', 'Yes', 'love', 'show', 'Yes', 'have', 'probably', 'will', 'buy', 'season', 'DVD', 'Yes', 'am', 'disappointed', 'editing', 'So', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'be', 'aware', 'buy', 'watch', 'are', ""n't"", 'completly', 'disappointed', 'was', 'when', 'first', 'bought', 'watched', 'Maybe', 'will', 'get', 'figured', 'out', 'stop', 'editing', 'ruining', 'favorite', 'show']",N/A

For some it represents a big part of their childhood, for others it's not much more than a silly teenage drama and a guilty pleasure, and for still others it's a serious commentary and totally relevant to real life (lol).For me it's mostly the first two and yeah, some of the issues are definitely things that touch many families while others are pretty ridiculous.  Whatever...I love this show!  Brandon's self-righteousness and expressive eyebrows, Brenda's drama and perpetual uncertainty over Dylan, Dylan's big hair and quivering voice, Donna's ditzyness, David's TERRIBLE singing and dancing, Steve's hotness and block-headed antics, Kelly's insecurity, Andrea's awkwardness--and yep, the famous love triangle...how can you not love it all even if you hate it?After so many years of waiting for this to come to dvd a lot of people rushed out to buy it, unaware that their memories, er, well the show's content has been more or less raped by CBS Paramount.A LOT of the music in the show has been changed (this pertains to seasons 1-3, since these are the only I have purchased so far I cannot speak to any of the other sets) and while that is a major distraction for fans who watched this during its original run so many years ago it is at the very least understandable due to licensing and rights to the music.  It sucks but at least there is a reason.What sucks AND seems inexcusable is the fact that the episodes are actually edited--meaning there are full scenes inexplicably cut from the original version that aired on Fox back in the early 90's.  Why?  If anyone can give me a valid reason for this, please leave a comment and do so!  I am dying to know what possible reason there could be for certain episodes being chopped up.  The reason I commented on season 3 and not 1 or 2 is because this issue seems to be the most noticeable here.  And quite frankly it has been so long since I have seen a lot of these episodes there is probably a lot more missing that I just don't remember.  And no, I am not imagining it--there is even a TINY comment on the back of the packaging that states ""certain"" episodes ""may"" be edited.So, awesome show but CBS Paramount is really hosing the fans by selling a shoddy set of dvds to them without giving them proper warning that what they are spending their hard-earned money on is not exactly what was originally aired.BEWARE--THIS IS NOT A FULLY INTACT VERSION OF THE SHOW YOU KNOW.  =(P.S.  One bright spot in the dvd editions is the special feature entitled ""Everything You Need To Know About Beverly Hills 90210"" which have comedians John Aboud and Michael Colton more or less making fun of the entire season one highlight at a time.  Absolutely hysterical fun.  I can see why some fans may not like it because after all it is two guys getting paid to watch the season of the show then ripping on it in the end, but as much as I love the show I constantly make fun of it, so to see these guys point out things I also found stupid and poke fun at some of the lamer story lines and characters is great.",3,2 Stars for this DVD set.  5 Stars for the show itself.
