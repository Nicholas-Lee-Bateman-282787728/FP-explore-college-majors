Girls dancing around then nothing. Girl screams then nothing. Girl screams some more then nothing. Flickering lights then nothing. Blanket pulled up by what clearly looks like strings then nothing. More screams then a lot more nothing.

Hagy ""DHagy &#34;movie goer&#34;""","[3, 4]","I knew I was in for something awful because this movie just starts and ends--there are NO credits to anyone; no director, no producer, no writers (*nudge, nudge/wink,wink*).  In fact, if you did not know the name of this movie, you would not have ANY idea about what was supposed to be the goings on here.One of the characters is given--natch--a hand-held camera for his birthday.  There's lots of footage of the party: there's boobs galore, typical mean girls talking, and lustful boys thinking they might get lucky.  Now keep in mind this supposedly takes place in Tennessee (although some of the property owned by the Bell Witch is in Kentucky), but I digress.  It is January and we have a pool party going on complete with palm trees.  Last time I checked, you are not going to be having any outside pool parties in Tennessee in January and there sure in the dickens aren't any palm trees.  Cut to the end of the party and you have a girl standing in front of the window looking as if she has just been hit in the head with a brick.  She and her boyfriend leave the party, only to be found dead later on.Brother's sister starts having nightmares about something, and this is supposedly ""found footage"" of all the events surrounding just about EVERYONE'S demise.  Nothing is explained--not even why when bodies are piling up the police investigating these mysterious goings-on look as if they, too, have been hit in the head with a brick.Enough with the ""found footage"" crap, people; it's been done to death--almost as much as zombie films.  I do not know what this was rated but I do know it was bad.  The color and appearance of the film, along with some of the acting, was decent.  At least the teenagers in this film looked like teens--not 30-somethings trying to pass for teens.  However, it was apparent there was no script here and no research had been done on the legend this movie was supposed to be about.  Done along the same lines as Paranormal Activity, ""The Bell Witch Haunting"" is a dog that ain't gonna' hunt.

They seemed a bit too young to me to have children in there older teens.Movie plays out just like the paranormal activity series even to the point of the same exact soundtrack music being played just before a paranormal occurrence happens.Watching it just seemed funny and very very predictable when a killing was going to happen.
