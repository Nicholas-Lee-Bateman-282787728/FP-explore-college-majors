Instead of a largely British film crew, in this one, it's a largely Spanish film crew. Not the actors, but the directors and producers. This one is more American-ized than the original, and I think there's more terror in this one than the original. ""Days"" definitely had more of an isolated and terrifyingly depressing feel to it, and I think the original is scarier.""Weeks"" picks up right where ""Days"" left off. The infection is back again, with even more violence and zombies. This one has even more of a back story to it within the characters other than the infection, which became the main point in the original. This one focuses more on the characters, since we already know about the infection from the first movie.The first 5 minutes of the film are kind of boring until the zombies come in a few minutes later. It makes the opening scene pretty terrifying. There are plenty other different zombie attack scenes that are pretty scary (the eye-gouging one was just gross, like the eye-gouging scene from the first). The main score to both films have a grunge rock-ish feel to them, and while it's not loud and disturbing, it's still a pretty creepy score, especially to a film that has to do with zombies.This paragraph contains some spoilers.) The ending leaves everything open for a sequel, which would be called ""28 Months Later"". In the ending, you see the zombies running towards the Eiffel Tower. It left me thinking ""No! Don't infect Paris!"" But altogether, I hope they make a 3rd one, because while both these movies aren't in my top 10 favorite horror movie list, I would still say I'm a fan of the series.",4,"A sequel that's better than the original, in my opinion.",1307145600,"06 4, 2011",2011,1727,"['28', 'Weeks', 'Later', ""n't"", 'as', 'unique', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'definitely', 'better', 'original', 'Instead', 'largely', 'British', 'film', 'crew', 'one', 'largely', 'Spanish', 'film', 'crew', 'Not', 'actors', 'directors', 'producers', 'one', 'more', 'American-ized', 'original', 'think', 'more', 'terror', 'one', 'original', 'Days', 'definitely', 'had', 'more', 'isolated', 'terrifyingly', 'depressing', 'feel', 'think', 'original', 'scarier', 'Weeks', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'Days', 'left', 'off', 'infection', 'back', 'again', 'even', 'more', 'violence', 'zombies', 'one', 'even', 'more', 'back', 'story', 'characters', 'other', 'infection', 'became', 'main', 'point', 'original', 'one', 'more', 'characters', 'already', 'know', 'infection', 'first', 'movie.The', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'kind', 'boring', 'zombies', 'come', 'few', 'minutes', 'later', 'opening', 'scene', 'pretty', 'terrifying', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'different', 'zombie', 'attack', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'scary', 'eye-gouging', 'one', 'was', 'just', 'gross', 'eye-gouging', 'scene', 'first', 'main', 'score', 'films', 'have', 'grunge', 'rock-ish', 'feel', 'not', 'loud', 'disturbing', 'still', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'score', 'especially', 'film', 'do', 'zombies.This', 'paragraph', 'spoilers', 'ending', 'leaves', 'everything', 'open', 'sequel', 'would', 'be', 'called', '28', 'Months', 'Later', 'ending', 'see', 'zombies', 'running', 'Eiffel', 'Tower', 'left', 'thinking', 'No', 'Do', ""n't"", 'infect', 'Paris', 'altogether', 'hope', 'make', '3rd', 'one', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'top', '10', 'favorite', 'horror', 'movie', 'list', 'would', 'still', 'say', ""'m"", 'fan', 'series']",28 Weeks Later

1090780,AP3HK75BBDMS5,B000TJBN7Q,"A. G Primack ""Master of Zen""","[1, 2]","28 Weeks Later is more than what it seems. It is the sequel to to 28 days later, which is loosely based on the terrific prescient science fiction novel Day of the Triffids.The Day of the Triffids is about the dangers of meddling with mother nature and weapons we do not completely understand and control. The triffids are a new variety of plant that yields important oils, yet is pretty enough to keep as an ornamental. But, the Triffids have a bite too. They can move, and they can kill anything that moves with a whiplike appendage. The oils that they secrete are important enough that they are raised on plantations in spite of this, and they are kept, almost as pets, to show off their exotic beauty by the well to do.Then the unthinkable happens. A new satellite weapon (the book was written just as sattelites happened) gets accidentaly released and blinds almost everyone. Only a few people are not blinded. Most of the book follows a few people as they try to cope with understanding what has happened, and then with the less than sociable response of some of the survivors and the murderous Triffids.The book is part of the apocalyptic view of the future that some people had in the 1950's in response to nuclear weapons, the realignment of power, and other tremendous changes in life.28 days later just translates the plot to the modern day. Instead of the Triffids, we have the Rage virus, a plausible possibility given the secret biological military research that has gone on in the last 50 years. The virus gets loose, and there is no vaccination, and no immunity. Almost everyone dies. In a reverse of the usual British pride at being an Island, and protected from the world, they virus is contained on the island, and the rest of the world is protected. Still, no one understands what has happened, or wants to come to the rescue. During the outbreak, the movie follows a few people as they strive to remain good and survive the outbreak. Along the way they have to deal with other groups that have lost their human souls and prey upon the uninfected in ways that are equally as bad as the infected. By sheer luck, a small band survives their ordeal, and is rescued several weeks or months later.28 Weeks Later carries on the biological menace theme. The infected die out, the few uninfected are found and rescued, and people are returned to Britain to start up anew. Life is beginning to renew itself, and even children (the innocents) are returning. But, biology is more complicated than most of us want to admit, and one of the survivors turns out to be a carrier. The normal human frailties intervene to unintentionally preserve the virus and transport it to Europe.As just a horror movie it is superb (not that I am a great expert). It has suspense equal to Night of the Living Dead. You want to root for the survivors. And perhaps the conclusion sneaks up on you. But if you understand enough of the potential of biology it dosen't.As science fiction it is also superb. It is not just a zombie creature film. It is also an imaginable alternative future of mankind. It is yet another of the parables about the dangers of science, industry, and war that seem to regularly come out of the English longing for the quiet pastoral life.As a tale of what humans will do under duress it is also superb. There are the leaders without pity for the people, the followers who blindly walk to their own demise, and those who fight for what is right and good in all of us. And none of them really knows what is what nature has in store for them. But do we really understand what we are doing?I waiting for 28 Months later, which should be the next one in the sequence if all plays out true.

1090781,A1ITCVZ46MUB3A,B000TJBN7Q,A Hot Whizzer Summer...,"[10, 11]","While I am not going to preach about how great the first movie was, I felt these sequel just messed up too much to be an enjoyable film. To keep it simple, i will just list the cons and pros of the film.Pros:1) The first 10 minutes were very cool, and set the movie up for an incredible story, unfortunately, they flopped it.2) A couple scenes were cool, I enjoyed the helicopter scene, although that was just utter gorefest crap, that some people may feel takes away from the movie.Cons:1) They flopped it, the most interesting and dynamic characters got killed literally when the first zombie appears, and they throw out all character anything to start a mindless chase scene.2) Breaking zombie lore. It is really bad when a squeal feels the need to break the zombie lore established in it's own movie. I am surprised noone has mentioned the fact that these zombies run around freely at daytime now. In 28 days, they avoided light and remained indoors during the daytime if they could help it, that is why the characters were so capable of moving around and you only saw infected indoors or in tunnels during the day. Every scene that had zombies outdoors occurred during sunset with the light fading. The other lore broken is the formation of the ""intelligent zombie"" that seemed to explicitly harass his loved ones and avoid the failsafes.3) The sheer stupidity of it. So many things in this are just stupid, so stupid that it is unforgivable. For your convenience, I will list them now.-The women in quarantine is left completely unguarded, even after they realized she was infected. A Janitor is given open access to her door with his card (a quarantined area for infected). The then infected janitor, apparently quarantined areas have no cameras, manages to open the door to let himself out of quarantine (quarantine, mind you) and kill several armed guards who are completely incapable of shooting and killing him.-In response to this threat, the army shoves everyone into a single, dark, crowded room, cause naturally, placing everyone in a crowded room is the best thing to do when confronted with a highly contagious virus. A room, I might add with a back door that is unguarded and easily opened by a single infected.-The army begins opening fire on everyone to kill the virus. So insanely, in fact, that they target and kill people that are obviously not infected. The best example, of course, is when they open fire on a moving car. Cause naturally, there could be a zombie driving that car? Maybe I can understand the napalm and poison to stop the threat, but shooting someone who shouts, ""don't shoot I am not a zombie"" in an area with no zombies present, without making any attempt to extract them is idiocy.- Apparently, not only do legions of zombies managed to escape a quarantined area after a napalm raid, even though it only showed like 15 escaping, but they all have radar gps units in their heads even with all of London at their disposal and immediately run to the area the few surviving humans head to for pick up. Plus the ""intelligent"" zombie I mentioned earlier manages to track them perfectly, yet doesn't choose to attack at numerous opportunities.- In the stadium tunnel, the stairway leading down is apparently pitch black, yet there is plenty of light at the bottom of the stairs for them to navigate once they fall down the stairs and wonder out about 10 feet from it. Plus, after falling down the stairs in a pitch black environment, whose impulse would be to calmly wonder away, not panic and run, but just meander away before the only person that can see has a chance to find you.Alright, after that, maybe you can see why I chose the score I did. I will grant it a 2 simply because of the potential, that under better hands, could have made this movie a great experience. At the moment the first zombie appeared. I muttered quite loudly, ""Oh my god, that is not the direction this movie is going"". Yet it was, they just tossed away the plot and started running from crazed gps infected, the end.",2,An example of how you ruin a good thing,1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,4035,"['am', 'not', 'going', 'preach', 'how', 'great', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'felt', 'sequel', 'just', 'messed', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'keep', 'simple', 'i', 'will', 'just', 'list', 'cons', 'pros', 'film.Pros:1', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'were', 'very', 'cool', 'set', 'movie', 'up', 'incredible', 'story', 'unfortunately', 'flopped', 'it.2', 'A', 'couple', 'scenes', 'were', 'cool', 'enjoyed', 'helicopter', 'scene', 'was', 'just', 'utter', 'gorefest', 'crap', 'people', 'may', 'feel', 'away', 'movie.Cons:1', 'flopped', 'most', 'interesting', 'dynamic', 'characters', 'got', 'killed', 'literally', 'when', 'first', 'zombie', 'throw', 'out', 'character', 'anything', 'start', 'mindless', 'chase', 'scene.2', 'Breaking', 'zombie', 'lore', 'really', 'bad', 'when', 'squeal', 'need', 'break', 'zombie', 'lore', 'established', 'own', 'movie', 'am', 'surprised', 'noone', 'mentioned', 'fact', 'zombies', 'run', 'around', 'freely', 'daytime', 'now', '28', 'days', 'avoided', 'light', 'remained', 'indoors', 'daytime', 'could', 'help', 'why', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'capable', 'moving', 'around', 'only', 'saw', 'infected', 'indoors', 'tunnels', 'day', 'scene', 'had', 'zombies', 'outdoors', 'occurred', 'sunset', 'light', 'fading', 'other', 'lore', 'broken', 'formation', 'intelligent', 'zombie', 'seemed', 'explicitly', 'harass', 'loved', 'ones', 'avoid', 'failsafes.3', 'sheer', 'stupidity', 'So', 'many', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'stupid', 'so', 'stupid', 'unforgivable', 'convenience', 'will', 'list', 'now.-The', 'women', 'quarantine', 'left', 'completely', 'unguarded', 'even', 'realized', 'was', 'infected', 'Janitor', 'given', 'open', 'access', 'door', 'card', 'quarantined', 'area', 'infected', 'then', 'infected', 'janitor', 'apparently', 'quarantined', 'areas', 'have', 'cameras', 'open', 'door', 'let', 'quarantine', 'quarantine', 'kill', 'several', 'armed', 'guards', 'who', 'are', 'completely', 'incapable', 'shooting', 'killing', 'him.-In', 'response', 'threat', 'army', 'everyone', 'single', 'dark', 'crowded', 'room', 'cause', 'naturally', 'placing', 'everyone', 'crowded', 'room', 'best', 'thing', 'do', 'when', 'confronted', 'highly', 'contagious', 'virus', 'room', 'might', 'add', 'back', 'door', 'unguarded', 'easily', 'opened', 'single', 'infected.-The', 'army', 'opening', 'fire', 'everyone', 'kill', 'virus', 'So', 'insanely', 'fact', 'target', 'kill', 'people', 'are', 'obviously', 'not', 'infected', 'best', 'example', 'course', 'when', 'open', 'fire', 'moving', 'car', 'Cause', 'naturally', 'could', 'be', 'zombie', 'driving', 'car', 'Maybe', 'can', 'understand', 'napalm', 'poison', 'stop', 'threat', 'shooting', 'someone', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'am', 'not', 'zombie', 'area', 'zombies', 'present', 'making', 'attempt', 'extract', 'idiocy.-', 'Apparently', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'legions', 'zombies', 'managed', 'escape', 'quarantined', 'area', 'napalm', 'raid', 'even', 'only', 'showed', '15', 'escaping', 'have', 'radar', 'gps', 'units', 'heads', 'even', 'London', 'disposal', 'immediately', 'run', 'area', 'few', 'surviving', 'humans', 'head', 'pick', 'up', 'intelligent', 'zombie', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'manages', 'track', 'perfectly', 'yet', ""n't"", 'choose', 'attack', 'numerous', 'opportunities.-', 'stadium', 'tunnel', 'stairway', 'leading', 'down', 'apparently', 'pitch', 'black', 'yet', 'plenty', 'light', 'bottom', 'stairs', 'navigate', 'once', 'fall', 'down', 'stairs', 'wonder', 'out', '10', 'feet', 'falling', 'down', 'stairs', 'pitch', 'black', 'environment', 'impulse', 'would', 'be', 'calmly', 'wonder', 'away', 'not', 'panic', 'run', 'just', 'meander', 'away', 'only', 'person', 'can', 'see', 'chance', 'find', 'you.Alright', 'maybe', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'chose', 'score', 'did', 'will', 'grant', '2', 'simply', 'potential', 'better', 'hands', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'great', 'experience', 'moment', 'first', 'zombie', 'appeared', 'muttered', 'quite', 'loudly', 'Oh', 'god', 'not', 'direction', 'movie', 'going', 'was', 'just', 'tossed', 'away', 'plot', 'started', 'running', 'crazed', 'gps', 'infected', 'end']",28 Weeks Later

1090784,AK0CENM3LUM28,B000TJBN7Q,Amazon Customer,"[8, 8]","28 Weeks Later / B000TJBN80*Spoilers*The tricky thing about sequels is that not only do they have to be good movies in their own right, but they also must weather the inevitable comparisons to the movie that it follows. And, fundamentally, this is the biggest problem with ""28 Weeks Later"". Following, as it does, from28 Days Later, but with seemingly everyone who was involved with ""28 Days"" completely replaced, it was inevitable that the resulting sequel would have a largely different tone than the first movie. Whether or not this change is a bad thing will depend on the viewer's expectations.""28 Weeks"" starts well enough - a group of survivors are holed up tight in a country house, far away from the cities and the rage virus. It's nice to see variety in a zombie movie, and the ensuing demonstration that frightening situations needn't be restricted to the dead of midnight is welcome. Viewers may reasonably question, however, why the otherwise apparently fairly prudent occupants of the house didn't take a few more steps to ensure their safety in this new, uncertain world - such as emigrating permanently to the second story, which seems to be more than roomy enough (shaky camera notwithstanding) and which - once isolated from the downstairs - would seem to be a permanent safe-haven from the rage victims, given that they aren't lucid enough to scale walls or build ladders.While this may seem like a small point, I feel it neatly underlines the changed between ""Days"" and ""Weeks"". The survivors in ""Days"" were modern 'real' people - in other words, they'd seen a zombie movie or three (as have we all) and subsequently they knew how to protect themselves. Flats barred with impenetrable walls of shopping carts, iron doors, and suits of makeshift armor were the refuge of the besieged in the city. The army out in the country employed round-the-clock shifts, mine fields, and a very prudent once-bit-then-shot policy that prevented serious disaster when one of their own was infected. The point behind all this is that ""Days"" was not a zombie movie in the traditional sense, but rather a movie about human nature under stressful, end-of-the-world conditions. Realistically, you could have replaced all the zombies with, say, nuclear fallout and you still would have had the same haunting themes in ""Days"" - namely, where our humanity begins and ends in a struggle for survival.""Weeks"", on the other hand, is pretty much a straight-up zombie movie, and in order to facilitate that, the humans have to be a lot less competent than they were in ""Days"". So we have desperate people failing to fall back to a secure upper story and a military with such poor security measures that it seems almost blind luck that they haven't been overrun yet. (Which isn't to say that ""Weeks"" doesn't attempt a point at military ethics, but the civilians-are-expendable message is so anvilicious compared to ""Days"" that it will likely annoy more than thoughtfully provoke.)Once you accept ""Weeks"" as a straight-up zombie movie, it's not a bad one. There's a living MacGuffin that has to be tracked down, protected, and gotten to safety once the inevitable disaster overruns the safe haven. The biggest problem here, though, is that the build-up to the disaster is long and tedious, with quite a bit of dialogue that sounds like it was meant to be deep and meaningful, but just comes off as the filler dialogue we've all heard before. And once the dying starts, the characters die off so predictably that they might as well all be wearing numbered jerseys.I guess you could say that I really loved ""28 Days"" because I went into the movie expecting a good, solid zombie flick, and I came out mentally shaken by the moral subtext and end-of-the-world break down of social relationships. But the downside to that meant that I went into ""28 Weeks"" expecting to be further mentally toyed with and was ultimately let down when the movie turned out to 'merely' be a decent, if predictable zombie flick. There's enough here to be interesting, mostly centering around the infected Typhoid Mary of the plot, but ultimately all that gets tossed down the drain in favor of running around in the dark getting eaten. And while there's nothing wrong with that, per se, ""28 Weeks"" doesn't end up standing out significantly from the hordes of similar movies on the market, in my opinion.~ Ana Mardoll",3,"Good Movie, but Poor Sequel",1253404800,"09 20, 2009",2009,4379,"['28', 'Weeks', 'Later', '/', 'B000TJBN80*Spoilers*The', 'tricky', 'thing', 'sequels', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'have', 'be', 'good', 'movies', 'own', 'right', 'also', 'must', 'weather', 'inevitable', 'comparisons', 'movie', 'fundamentally', 'biggest', 'problem', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'Following', 'from28', 'Days', 'Later', 'seemingly', 'everyone', 'who', 'was', 'involved', '28', 'Days', 'completely', 'replaced', 'was', 'inevitable', 'resulting', 'sequel', 'would', 'have', 'largely', 'different', 'tone', 'first', 'movie', 'not', 'change', 'bad', 'thing', 'will', 'depend', 'viewer', 'expectations', '28', 'Weeks', 'well', 'enough', 'group', 'survivors', 'are', 'holed', 'up', 'tight', 'country', 'house', 'far', 'away', 'cities', 'rage', 'virus', 'nice', 'see', 'variety', 'zombie', 'movie', 'ensuing', 'demonstration', 'frightening', 'situations', 'need', ""n't"", 'be', 'restricted', 'dead', 'midnight', 'welcome', 'Viewers', 'may', 'reasonably', 'question', 'however', 'why', 'otherwise', 'apparently', 'fairly', 'prudent', 'occupants', 'house', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'few', 'more', 'steps', 'ensure', 'safety', 'new', 'uncertain', 'world', 'such', 'emigrating', 'permanently', 'second', 'story', 'be', 'more', 'roomy', 'enough', 'shaky', 'camera', 'notwithstanding', 'once', 'isolated', 'downstairs', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'permanent', 'safe-haven', 'rage', 'victims', 'given', 'are', ""n't"", 'lucid', 'enough', 'scale', 'walls', 'build', 'may', 'seem', 'small', 'point', 'feel', 'neatly', 'changed', 'Days', 'Weeks', 'survivors', 'Days', 'were', 'modern', ""'real"", 'people', 'other', 'words', ""'d"", 'seen', 'zombie', 'movie', 'three', 'have', 'subsequently', 'knew', 'how', 'protect', 'Flats', 'barred', 'impenetrable', 'walls', 'shopping', 'carts', 'iron', 'doors', 'suits', 'makeshift', 'armor', 'were', 'refuge', 'besieged', 'city', 'army', 'out', 'country', 'employed', 'round-the-clock', 'shifts', 'mine', 'fields', 'very', 'prudent', 'once-bit-then-shot', 'policy', 'prevented', 'serious', 'disaster', 'when', 'one', 'own', 'was', 'infected', 'point', 'Days', 'was', 'not', 'zombie', 'movie', 'traditional', 'sense', 'rather', 'movie', 'human', 'nature', 'stressful', 'end-of-the-world', 'conditions', 'Realistically', 'could', 'have', 'replaced', 'zombies', 'say', 'nuclear', 'fallout', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'same', 'haunting', 'themes', 'Days', 'namely', 'where', 'humanity', 'struggle', 'survival', 'Weeks', 'other', 'hand', 'pretty', 'much', 'straight-up', 'zombie', 'movie', 'order', 'facilitate', 'humans', 'have', 'be', 'lot', 'less', 'competent', 'were', 'Days', 'have', 'desperate', 'people', 'failing', 'fall', 'back', 'secure', 'upper', 'story', 'military', 'such', 'poor', 'security', 'measures', 'almost', 'blind', 'luck', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'overrun', 'yet', 'Which', ""n't"", 'say', 'Weeks', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'point', 'military', 'ethics', 'civilians-are-expendable', 'message', 'so', 'anvilicious', 'compared', 'Days', 'will', 'likely', 'annoy', 'more', 'thoughtfully', 'provoke', 'accept', 'Weeks', 'straight-up', 'zombie', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'one', 'living', 'MacGuffin', 'be', 'tracked', 'down', 'protected', 'gotten', 'safety', 'once', 'inevitable', 'disaster', 'safe', 'haven', 'biggest', 'problem', 'here', 'build-up', 'disaster', 'long', 'tedious', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'just', 'off', 'filler', 'dialogue', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'once', 'dying', 'characters', 'die', 'so', 'predictably', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'all', 'be', 'wearing', 'numbered', 'jerseys.I', 'guess', 'could', 'say', 'really', 'loved', '28', 'Days', 'went', 'movie', 'expecting', 'good', 'solid', 'zombie', 'flick', 'came', 'out', 'mentally', 'shaken', 'moral', 'subtext', 'end-of-the-world', 'break', 'social', 'relationships', 'downside', 'meant', 'went', '28', 'Weeks', 'expecting', 'be', 'further', 'mentally', 'toyed', 'was', 'ultimately', 'let', 'down', 'when', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', ""'merely"", 'be', 'decent', 'predictable', 'zombie', 'flick', 'enough', 'here', 'be', 'interesting', 'mostly', 'centering', 'infected', 'Typhoid', 'Mary', 'plot', 'ultimately', 'tossed', 'down', 'drain', 'favor', 'running', 'around', 'dark', 'getting', 'eaten', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'se', '28', 'Weeks', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'standing', 'out', 'significantly', 'hordes', 'similar', 'movies', 'market', 'opinion.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",28 Weeks Later

The first movie was good although a little slow in places.  However, it had a unique take on the zombie genre.  In fact, they aren't really zombies in these movies (depending upon what your definition is I guess), but still you could see how 28 Days Later influenced the Walking Dead TV show from the very beginning where both start out with a guy waking up from a coma.  Anyway, this second movie has a decent cast with a couple of recognizable American actors and a mix of British actors that I didn't necessarily recognize.  Good acting isn't really much of a requirement for a movie like this, but the acting wasn't bad.  There isn't much plot to the movie.  In a way it is like a scarier and more violent version of Jurassic Park with a boy and his older sister trapped on an island and trying to escape from monsters with the aid of a few adults.  I wouldn't want to go into much more detail about the plot and spoil it.  However, one scene had the kids wandering in the dark and although I didn't find the scene particularly scary to view I bet it was a scary scene for a child actor to be in.

1090790,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B000TJBN7Q,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[1, 3]","Danny Boyle and Alex Garland's film was done in such a way that a sequel was almost bound to fail. Their film was a horror movie alright, but it was really an exercise in experimental filmmaking. Any film that was to follow it up will have to contend with the cool factor of not just a twist on the zombie theme (even they are not zombies) but the choice in music and look of the film. All I can say is that 28 Weeks Later doesn't disappoint and even surpasses the original film in certain aspects.Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo does a great job of trying to stick to the premise begun by Boyle and Garland in 28 Days Later and adding his own signature to the sequel. The film begins with a scene which encapsulates what someone who never saw the original film needs to know about what to expect with this one. We're introduced to Don (played by a gaunt and quite haunted Robert Carlyle) and Alice (Catherine McCormack) trying to survive with several others at their English countryside cottage just outside London during the first couple weeks of the Rage-virus outbreak. This prologue shows just how tenuous any form of safe haven can be once sentimentality overrides the primal instinct for self-preservation. Don is given a choice of choosing sentimentality to try and save someone he cares about and maybe die in the process or follow the basic need for self-preservation in time of extreme danger and distress. Don picks the latter and we're shown how horrible his choice was but at the same time how plausible a decision it was when put into context. If we were put in a similar situation could we honestly say that we wouldn't had made the same choice which Don took. The scene with Don running across the open field with dozens upon dozens of Rage-infected people chasing after him was quite chilling.The movie goes through an introductory credit sequence explaining the timeline since Don's escape from the cottage. We're told that the British Isles was quickly quarantined once authorities saw how futile it was to try and save it from the ravages of Rage in the first couple weeks. Following-up on the final scenes in the original film, we know now that those infected by Rage would soon die out due to starvation and that 28 weeks after the first sign of outbreak the world outside of the British Isles have decided that it was now time to clean out the last vestiges of Rage-infected victims who haven't starved to death and begin reconstruction and repopulation of the country. The U.S.-led NATO force in charge of this monumental project is led by U.S. Army general Stone (The Wire's excellent Idris Elba) and have cordoned off a safe sanctuary in London's Isle of Dogs where British citizens who escaped the initial outbreak or were outside the Islands when it began would be housed in while London was slowly sanitized.This is where Don has been sent and given a job as a manager helping with getting London back on its feet. We're shown the arrival of Don's two children who were safely abroad in Spain when the outbreak first hit England. Their reunion is heartfelt though bittersweet as Don must answer his children's questions about what happened to their mother. Let's just say that Don's explanation is not exactly accurate. The Tammy and Andy (played by newcomers Imogen Poot and Mackintosh Muggleton) take his answers at face value but still end up sneaking out of the protected Green Zone to get to their old cottage to pick-up some items of sentimental value. This is the only part of the movie which seemed implausible and made me realize that once again a horror movie ended up with some characters doing dumb things that would lead to nothing but death and destruction. What the two kids find once they get to the cottage marks the beginning of re-infection and the extreme policies enacted by the military to contain the problem. But containment doesn't hold and soon enough a Code Red order is given to all military personnel.It is once the Code Red is given that most filmgoers will see the allegorical similarities of U.S. policies and tactics in their War against Terror, especially in Iraq. While I do not prescribe to this notion, Frescadillo handled the situation well. I say I do not prescribe to the notion that the second-half of the movie is a direct condemnation of U.S. war against terror and occupation of Iraq, because it's a theme in apocalyptic movies that's been used before there was a war on terror. It is in this second-half where 28 Weeks Later reminded me a lot of George A. Romero's underappreciated horror film, The Crazies. Just like in that film, the military in 28 Weeks Later don't seem to be heartless about their reaction to the new outbreak and break of containment. Instead their overreaction to the whole deteriorating situation looks to be born more out of desperation and an inability to comprehend the best and most humane way to combat the crisis. As it's always mentioned in other forms of fiction, the military is a blunt instrument and never a subtle one. The Rage infection and those infected seem to only be stopped when using the most blunt procedures and tactics, but such ways also have a tendency to cause much collateral damage to the innocent.28 Weeks Later is much more epic in scope that 28 Days Later and it is in that which it surpasses the original film. While the first film is more the lives of two disparating groups of survivors and how both groups attempts to survive shows how quickly one could fall from civilized behavior while another continues to hold on to it, the sequel shows that in the end even people with the best of intentions will succumb to the basic instinct of survival with any means necessary. The established shots of London overhead and down on the ground empty and lifeless really brings the apocalyptic nature of the movie with the force of a sledgehammer. These scenes followed up with the firebombing of Canary Wharf really highlights just how much more grimmer and nihilistic in tone and scope Fresnadillo's sequel over Boyle's more hopeful one. It is quite a surprise that its the actions of the youngest and most innocent (as children are usually protrayed in horror movies) which causes a new cycle of outbreak and ultimately the fall of the attempt to bring normalcy back to the British Isles.I would say that --- even though the movie doesn't really involve zombies but zombie-like people --- 28 Weeks Later actually resembles George A. Romero's Living Dead films more than Boyle's 28 Days Later. While Boyle's film took some of its basic themes from Romero's work, he still didn't go far enough. Fresnadillo took the theme of humanity being more dangerous than the Rage-infected ones during the original film's third act and expands on it with 28 Weeks Later. There's a deep sense of pessimism and cutthroat survival instincts inherent in the film's themes. The only form of humanity to be seen actually comes from the same Americans whose attempts of reconstruction ends up an exercise in total annihilation of the problem even if it includes the innocent being destroyed in the process.As a sequel to 28 Days Later, Fresnadillo's film shared some stylistic and thematic qualities with the original film, but ends up becoming a wholly independent work (one could watch this sequel without having seen the original and still understand what was going on). Where the original film only touches the surface of the Rage virus doomsday effect on the British Isles and its population, 28 Weeks Later ceases that basic notion and gives the viewer a first-hand look at its aftermath and, later on, how it looks when an outbreak occurs in an area packed with survivors. For a fan of Romero's classic zombie epics I do prefer Fresnadillo's work and the look of his film over the original one, but he does sacrifice some level of characterization to keep the film's tone and frenetic pacing in the latter-half from being bogged down. The film ends on a really downbeat note even as survivors make it to safety. This film really becomes an exercise in nihilism more than what Danny Boyle and Alex Garland were willing to do with the original film.In the end, 28 Weeks Later brings over enough of what made the first film such a cult, and later on, a mainstream horror success to be considered a sequel that matches the first one in quality, and at times even surpasses the original in certain aspects. The acting is actually very good despite some characters not being fleshed-out more thoroughly, but I find this understandable to keep the frantic pace of the film from start to finish from being slowed down. For fans of the first film I don't think this sequel will be a disappointment. It may not reach the same creative heights for some fans but it surely won't ruin the experience of having seen the original. The film also introduces a new face to the genre world with the excellent work turned in by Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo. In addition to Alexandre Aja from France and now Fresnadillo, the world of horror is getting a nice infusion of young talent.",5,A sequel which equals and at times surpasses the

The scene involving a man running to his boat while these fast-paced zombie-like creatures chased after him was more confusing to watch than it should have been.  There was so many unnecessary rapid movements in the camera shots that I could barely tell what was going on.  After all the fast-moving shots were over, you then saw that the man finally escaped on the boat and was free.  It was really awkward.  Sometimes action scenes can move TOO fast, and this is a great example of that.After the 40 minutes of boredom in the beginning was over, the story finally became to pick up (and so did the action scenes).  From there, the virus that was infecting the people and making them go crazy began to become the main focal point of the story.  The actual virus was disgusting to witness, with the people quickly shooting blood all over the place as they banged their heads repeatedly against the walls.  Quite unrealistic though, and just exciting for the violence only.This resulted in these snipers who were on top of buildings at nighttime aiming directly for the kill shots to eliminate the creatures, and therefore, getting rid of the virus and preventing it from spreading.  This was the most interesting part of the entire movie.  Actually, just the fact the snipers were so accurate with their shots was pretty scary itself!None of the storytelling aspects were interesting that involved any of the main characters.  The older girl and the younger boy were both pretty forgettable.  Overall, just a decent movie for people who want to see these new and improved deadly zombies that can move as quickly as people can, and just an alright movie and nothing more.",3,very average,1209168000,"04 26, 2008",2008,1801,"['had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'movie.The', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'so', 'was', 'nothing', 'one', 'clumsy', 'confusing', 'segment', 'scene', 'involving', 'man', 'running', 'boat', 'fast-paced', 'zombie-like', 'creatures', 'chased', 'was', 'more', 'confusing', 'watch', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'so', 'many', 'unnecessary', 'rapid', 'movements', 'camera', 'could', 'barely', 'tell', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'fast-moving', 'shots', 'were', 'over', 'then', 'saw', 'man', 'finally', 'escaped', 'boat', 'was', 'free', 'was', 'really', 'awkward', 'Sometimes', 'action', 'scenes', 'can', 'move', 'TOO', 'fast', 'great', 'example', 'that.After', '40', 'minutes', 'boredom', 'beginning', 'was', 'over', 'story', 'finally', 'became', 'pick', 'up', 'so', 'did', 'action', 'scenes', 'there', 'virus', 'was', 'infecting', 'people', 'making', 'go', 'crazy', 'began', 'become', 'main', 'focal', 'point', 'story', 'actual', 'virus', 'was', 'disgusting', 'witness', 'people', 'quickly', 'shooting', 'blood', 'place', 'banged', 'heads', 'repeatedly', 'walls', 'Quite', 'unrealistic', 'just', 'exciting', 'violence', 'only.This', 'resulted', 'snipers', 'who', 'were', 'top', 'buildings', 'nighttime', 'aiming', 'directly', 'kill', 'shots', 'eliminate', 'creatures', 'therefore', 'getting', 'rid', 'virus', 'preventing', 'spreading', 'was', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'Actually', 'just', 'fact', 'snipers', 'were', 'so', 'accurate', 'shots', 'was', 'pretty', 'scary', 'None', 'storytelling', 'aspects', 'were', 'interesting', 'involved', 'main', 'characters', 'older', 'girl', 'younger', 'boy', 'were', 'pretty', 'forgettable', 'Overall', 'just', 'decent', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'new', 'improved', 'deadly', 'zombies', 'can', 'move', 'as', 'quickly', 'people', 'can', 'just', 'alright', 'movie', 'nothing', 'more']",28 Weeks Later

These types of movies always require dumb characters doing incredibly stupid things that no normal human, who is not suffering from Downs Syndrome, would do.  One thing that is unique to the 28 Weeks Later (and 28 Days) is the puzzling fact that no human even fights back when attacked by a Rage Virus human.  They just seem to roll over and die?  It's lame.  The enormously complex plot (sarcasm) involves the Military trying to re-populate London.  It centers around a woman (Catherine McCormack) who is a carrier of the virus but not affected by it. Being totally predictable and relying on a tremendous amount of stupid actions by characters, it's easy to see where this movie is going.  Her idiot husband sneaks into the lab where his wife is being kept and kisses her, thus being infected and causing the Rage Virus to spread back into London.  Wow, didn't see that one coming.  Anyway, all havoc breaks loose as the infected guy escapes, easily killing helpless well armed soldiers that roll over and die without fighting back. There's no point in explaining the movie further, because you probably already figured out the rest.  It just boils down to the routine group of hapless people trapped in a city surrounded by hordes of infected trying to escape and getting picked off one by one.

1090801,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B000TJBN7Q,California Dreaming,"[0, 1]","A while back, I watched part of a documentary that showed something really disgusting:  a pizza delivery guy, on camera (he didn't know that he was being filmed) pulled up in front of a house, opened the pizza box, licked every piece of pizza, closed the lid, and then delivered the pizza.  To unsuspecting fools, fools that gave him a tip.You should be disgusted just thinking about it, but what about me?  I had to watch.  And worse for someone else, someone else that actually ended up eating that pizza.  And that's what I was actually thinking about here at probably the beginning of the second act, when a couple of kids sneak out of a quarantined building in search of a little fun.  They find a pizza joint -- presumably closed 28 Weeks Earlier -- where there is a pizza box on the counter and another on the ground.  The kids opened the lid on each box, and I swore to God that they were going to take a bite.  Now, I know that if you haven't had pizza in over half a year -- 28 weeks to be precise -- this might be tempting.  But it wouldn't be that tempting.And this film tries to be gross at times, but it's not as successful as the first film for sure.  &#34;28 Days Later&#34; was far more successful, as they showed really fast &#34;zombies&#34; (were they really zombies or something else?) chowing down on human flesh.  You could argue that that's gross too, perhaps grosser than eating bad pizza.  But that earlier film didn't actually make me want to puke.  Not like watching that kid almost take a bite of pizza that had been laying around for 28 weeks.  Especially if a zombie had licked all the pieces beforehand.But worse than all of this imagery, this film uses appeal to emotion, bringing in the teenage characters here.  That just didn't work for me.  Perhaps if I were a teenager, this film would have appealed to me more?  The first film was surely targeted at adults, and it felt like to me that they were targeting a much younger audience.Well, after that documentary that I described in the first paragraph, I refused to ever order takeout again, not that I ever did much before then.  And I should have followed some more of my own advice, which was &#34;Don't ever watch a sequel, especially the second in a series.  It's always unappetizing.&#34;  Kinda like any of those pizzas, real or imagined.",3,Don't Eat the Pizza,1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,2331,"['while', 'back', 'watched', 'part', 'documentary', 'showed', 'something', 'really', 'disgusting', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'guy', 'camera', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'being', 'filmed', 'pulled', 'up', 'front', 'house', 'opened', 'pizza', 'box', 'licked', 'piece', 'pizza', 'closed', 'lid', 'then', 'delivered', 'pizza', 'unsuspecting', 'fools', 'fools', 'gave', 'tip.You', 'should', 'be', 'disgusted', 'just', 'thinking', 'what', 'had', 'watch', 'worse', 'someone', 'else', 'someone', 'else', 'actually', 'ended', 'up', 'eating', 'pizza', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'thinking', 'here', 'probably', 'beginning', 'second', 'act', 'when', 'couple', 'kids', 'sneak', 'quarantined', 'building', 'search', 'little', 'fun', 'find', 'pizza', 'joint', 'presumably', 'closed', '28', 'Weeks', 'Earlier', 'where', 'pizza', 'box', 'counter', 'ground', 'kids', 'opened', 'lid', 'box', 'swore', 'God', 'were', 'going', 'take', 'bite', 'Now', 'know', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'pizza', 'year', '28', 'weeks', 'be', 'precise', 'might', 'be', 'tempting', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'tempting.And', 'film', 'be', 'gross', 'times', 'not', 'as', 'successful', 'first', 'film', 'sure', '34', '28', 'Days', 'Later', '34', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'successful', 'showed', 'really', 'fast', '34', 'zombies', '34', 'were', 'really', 'zombies', 'something', 'else', 'chowing', 'down', 'human', 'flesh', 'could', 'argue', 'gross', 'too', 'perhaps', 'grosser', 'eating', 'bad', 'pizza', 'earlier', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'make', 'want', 'puke', 'Not', 'watching', 'almost', 'take', 'bite', 'pizza', 'had', 'been', 'laying', 'around', '28', 'weeks', 'Especially', 'zombie', 'had', 'licked', 'pieces', 'beforehand.But', 'worse', 'imagery', 'film', 'appeal', 'emotion', 'bringing', 'teenage', 'characters', 'here', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Perhaps', 'were', 'teenager', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'appealed', 'more', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'surely', 'targeted', 'adults', 'felt', 'were', 'targeting', 'much', 'younger', 'audience.Well', 'documentary', 'described', 'first', 'paragraph', 'refused', 'ever', 'order', 'takeout', 'again', 'not', 'ever', 'did', 'much', 'then', 'should', 'have', 'followed', 'more', 'own', 'advice', 'was', '34', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'watch', 'sequel', 'especially', 'second', 'series', 'always', 'unappetizing.', '34', 'Kinda', 'pizzas', 'real', 'imagined']",28 Weeks Later

The original infection victims are still at large and manage to break their way into a barricaded house. Only one man is able to escape and ends up leaving his wife behind. Pretty soon after the rage zombies start to die off from starvation and the US army starts actions to resettle mainland Brittain. 28 weeks after the infection broke out the man meets his two kids in London and tell them of how their mother had been killed by the infected. The brother and sister end up making their way out of the secured part of London and into the still unsecured residential areas to go and visit their old home. Their they find their Mom who is still alive but a carrier of the virus. The Mom is taken back to the secured part of the city. Based on an error in judgement with the Dad he becomes infected from his wife through saliva which restarts a soon to be full-scale infection.The second half of this film is almost non-stop chaos and action. The civilians now have no one to go to as the soldiers are now ordered to kill everyone in order to maintain the quarantine. This sequel can be compaired with ""Aliens"" considering the increased level of violence from the first film and the larger number of infected shown on screen. This movie is faster-paced and has increased gore levels than the first but also has less traditional horror elements such as suspense. This is more of an action horror film than a more standard horror film like the first. There is a helicopter scene in here that is unrealistic yet very entertaining where the pilot uses the propeller blades to chop through a field full of zombies. Planet Terror also has a similar scene with a helicopter but the main difference with this one is that limbs and body parts are shown flying everywhere while in the other it is mostly a large amount of blood splatter. It is debatable which movie did it first and who copied who. Overall this is a very entertaining sequel that delivers in the horror and gore department. Some flaws in logic such as how the infected father is able to infect the whole area drag the movie down just a bit to be not quite as much a quality horror film like the first.

1090807,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B000TJBN7Q,Carl Manes,"[1, 1]","In 28 days, Britain was destroyed by a deadly virus. It has been six months. The plague is dead, and those that escaped are slowly being reinstated back into their homes by the US Armed Forces. When a lone survivor is found hiding amongst the wreckage, military officials believe that they may hold the key to finding a cure, but unfortunately for them, she is also a carrier for the horrible disease! The Rage virus returns in 28 WEEKS LATER, and in a big way. We see how quickly the virus is able to spread again from the very beginning, as it consumes everyone in its path and takes over the streets of London once more. Collateral damage is the name of the game; when the virus strikes, the real terror isn't in being eaten... It is in dodging bullets. 28 WEEKS LATER continues the theme where man is shown to be the bigger monster, and the complete disregard for human life proves to be the most frightening. This tool is used most effectively when Robert Carlyle selfishly abandons his wife for fear of being eaten in the opening scene.Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo steps up the action and violence in 28 WEEKS LATER, but the story leaves much to be desired. One must fully surrender to the implausibility of the plot and the giant leaps in logic in order to enjoy the film. At the very least, it seems highly unlikely that a country ravished by a deadly virus would begin repopulating itself a mere six months after the devastation. The fact that anyone could survive long enough during this period without the military spotting them in a highly secured zone is a bit much, but then to leave this person completely unguarded only to have the plague begin again requires some real incompetence. This may play into the anti-American sentiment that is embedded throughout the film, however, as the US is portrayed as being a gun-toting police state governing world affairs with semi-automatics and napalm. London turns out to be nothing more than an experiment, and when it fails, it is wiped clean.Many of these issues could easily be overlooked had we been given compelling characters to move us through the plot, but no one steps in to win the audiences' affection. The two children are as one-dimensional as the military officials looking to save them, and even the deaths of several major characters lack emotional impact. Instead, we have an hour-and-a-half of bland characters beating extraordinary odds in order to survive. Still, there are enough stylish moments of tension and suspense to keep us watching.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,ILHM Reviews 28 Weeks Later,1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,2554,"['28', 'days', 'Britain', 'was', 'destroyed', 'deadly', 'virus', 'been', 'six', 'months', 'plague', 'dead', 'escaped', 'are', 'slowly', 'being', 'reinstated', 'back', 'homes', 'US', 'Armed', 'Forces', 'When', 'lone', 'survivor', 'found', 'hiding', 'wreckage', 'military', 'officials', 'believe', 'may', 'hold', 'key', 'finding', 'cure', 'unfortunately', 'also', 'carrier', 'horrible', 'disease', 'Rage', 'virus', 'returns', '28', 'WEEKS', 'LATER', 'big', 'way', 'see', 'how', 'quickly', 'virus', 'able', 'spread', 'again', 'very', 'beginning', 'everyone', 'path', 'streets', 'London', 'once', 'more', 'Collateral', 'damage', 'name', 'game', 'when', 'virus', 'strikes', 'real', 'terror', ""n't"", 'being', 'eaten', 'dodging', 'bullets', '28', 'WEEKS', 'LATER', 'theme', 'where', 'man', 'shown', 'be', 'bigger', 'monster', 'complete', 'disregard', 'human', 'life', 'proves', 'be', 'most', 'frightening', 'tool', 'used', 'most', 'effectively', 'when', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'selfishly', 'abandons', 'wife', 'fear', 'being', 'eaten', 'opening', 'scene.Director', 'Juan', 'Carlos', 'Fresnadillo', 'up', 'action', 'violence', '28', 'WEEKS', 'LATER', 'story', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'One', 'must', 'fully', 'surrender', 'implausibility', 'plot', 'giant', 'leaps', 'logic', 'order', 'enjoy', 'film', 'very', 'least', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'country', 'ravished', 'deadly', 'virus', 'would', 'begin', 'repopulating', 'mere', 'six', 'months', 'devastation', 'fact', 'anyone', 'could', 'survive', 'long', 'enough', 'period', 'military', 'spotting', 'highly', 'secured', 'zone', 'bit', 'much', 'then', 'leave', 'person', 'completely', 'unguarded', 'only', 'have', 'plague', 'begin', 'again', 'real', 'incompetence', 'may', 'play', 'anti-American', 'sentiment', 'embedded', 'film', 'however', 'US', 'portrayed', 'being', 'gun-toting', 'police', 'state', 'governing', 'world', 'affairs', 'semi-automatics', 'napalm', 'London', 'out', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'experiment', 'when', 'wiped', 'clean.Many', 'issues', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'overlooked', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'compelling', 'characters', 'move', 'plot', 'one', 'steps', 'win', 'audiences', 'affection', 'two', 'children', 'are', 'as', 'one-dimensional', 'military', 'officials', 'looking', 'save', 'even', 'deaths', 'several', 'major', 'characters', 'lack', 'emotional', 'impact', 'Instead', 'have', 'hour-and-a-half', 'bland', 'characters', 'beating', 'extraordinary', 'odds', 'order', 'survive', 'Still', 'are', 'enough', 'stylish', 'moments', 'tension', 'suspense', 'keep', 'watching.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",28 Weeks Later

Although I should have known it would be bad, because the first one was so freaking good. This movie, as other reviewers have pointed out, has too many points in it that I you are saying ""no way that would happen"" and you are too preoccupied about that to even care about what is happening on screen with the characters or plot. I didn't care about anyone surviving, because they were all idiots. The Father who kisses his obviously infected exposed wife, the two kids who sneak out to get photographs knowing that in time they would probably get them anyway, the soldiers and the doctor who have no common sense between them. I think I was harboring a secret fantasy that the little boy would get torn to shreds, because his behavior and downright stupidity made me frustrated. Who falls down stairs/escalators and just gets up and wanders off from there? Wouldn't you stay where you fell?

It comes when Don (Robert Carlyle) decides to plant a wet kiss on his obviously exposed-to-infection wife, despite having seen the Zombies first-hand and knowing full-well how the infection travels and how it has pretty much decimated the population of Britain. I watched this at the Westlake Village Promenade today at 4:50pm with a crowd of mostly teenage guys and even a lot of them were shocked at how ridiculous this was."" - Bryce Zabel, moviesmackdownBig budget blood drenched sequel could have been so much better. Another ridiculous moment comes when they start firebombing part of the city--gee, why not just nuke all of London, if infrastructure destruction is not a problem, then you could be certain of extermination? Then the city is gassed, why didn't they do that in the first place? Well they have a big budget this time and lots of huge fiery explosions are obligatory I guess.Another thing, the camera shakes WAY too much. What's going on? When the boy sees his infected father through the door, the camera moves very fast and next thing you know the rage has spread inside the quarantined building. What happened? Only by going slow-motion through this sequence can one see he breaks through a heavy locked steel door by simply banging on it. 300 people are trapped inside but one skinny infected gets in no problemo. The boy sure must be a good sprinter cause he gets from the door to walking over people 40 ft away in .5 seconds. And you know exactly what is going to happen when the rage hits a large crowd of people because it is described in detail in the first film (the airport story). I submit to you, a predictable scene does not make for a scary one no matter how much blood, screaming and unsteady camerawork you throw in.The original had lots of slow parts with interesting dialog and scenery that made one think and give a breather between the scary parts. This movie just got on the bandwagon of all the bad ultra-bloody films that have come out since the original--Hostel, Saw, Hills Have Eyes, etc and, not to be outdone, is scene after scene of murder and mayhem. The one interesting idea in this one, that some can be immune, is not really developed except to spread the virus to show, you got it, more blood and gore.The music throughout is THE EXACT SAME as in the original, they couldn't even get original music??

1090817,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000TJBN7Q,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 0]","Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" put an interesting twist on the Zombie Film genre, namely that the zombies technically weren't dead; they fell victim to a virus that turned them into raging, animalistic monsters. And they actually ran after their prey as opposed to ambling along like drunks, moaning and groaning all the while. But despite the prominence of blood and guts, the effectiveness of that film depended more on the human drama, centering on an isolated group of survivors trekking across the British countryside. For the most part, the same formula is followed for ""28 Weeks Later,"" which is probably why it works. The only difference between the two films is that this one is larger, with more characters, more violence, and more gore. Does that make it an inferior film? No, not really--surprisingly, it remains on equal ground.The film opens during the middle of the original crisis. A small group of people barricaded in a rural cottage is ambushed by the Infected. The only escapee is Don (Robert Carlyle), someone the audience will have trouble labeling as either good or bad. On the one hand, the fact that he abandoned his wife, Alice (Catherine McCormack), and left her for dead doesn't put him in a good light. On the other hand, any one of us would probably do the same thing when thrust into such a desperate situation. It's all about survival; it's no longer about love and commitment.The story then flashes forward six months. The American military has since stepped in and successfully decontaminated and reconstructed an isle directly adjacent to London; twenty-four hour electricity has been restored, as have hot and cold running water and supermarkets (they've also reopened a pub). Fifteen thousand people populate the area, with more survivors arriving everyday. The two most important survivors are siblings Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton), Don's adolescent children. They're absolutely delighted to be reunited with their father ... that is, until they learn that their mother is gone. Worried at the prospect of forgetting all about her, they decide to sneak out of the safety zone and pay a visit to their old house.Once there, they discover that their mother is still alive. She's then examined by the American military; as they feared, she's infected with the Rage Virus. Yet she doesn't show any symptoms, which leads Medical Officer Scarlet (Rose Byrne) to believe that Alice is carrying some kind of antibody. Could this mean that a vaccine is on the horizon? Maybe even a cure? Unfortunately, no one will ever know; a series of mishaps reintroduces the virus to the population, resulting in pandemonium. The military is forced to execute Code Red, which states that everyone must be exterminated whether or not they're infected.The rest of the film is effectively frantic and fast paced, focusing its energy on Andy and Tammy's fight for survival. At this point, Scarlet realizes how important the siblings are; if their mother carried an antibody for the Rage Virus, chances are at least one of the children does, as well. This is quite an interesting reversal: the siblings' love for their mother essentially made them responsible for reintroducing the virus, and now they may be the only ones who can stop it from spreading. This shows a complexity and depth that's rarely present in a horror movie, and it takes on greater significance during some of the film's more gruesome scenes. Example: gunning down innocent people proves too much for Doyle (Jeremy Renner), a dedicated military officer. In a direct violation of his orders, he decides to help Tammy and Andy escape.But for the dedicated Zombie Film fanatics out there--the ones who could care less about such complexity--you can rest easy knowing that this film contains plenty of frightening, blood-soaked moments. I'll be the first to admit that it's a lot of fun to watch; that's half the appeal of a Zombie Film. But make no mistake: ""28 Weeks Later"" completely avoids B-movie territory, allowing believable drama to get through to the audience. Even in the midst of violence, gore, and terror, the audience can feel the emotional turmoil toying with the characters, even the ones that aren't as decent as they appear to be.The film works in other ways, as well. I distinctly remember a scene near the end of the film with Scarlet, Tammy, and Andy in the London Underground. It's pitch black; Scarlet relies on her night vision scope to help the siblings move along. They try to avoid stepping on the dozens of rotting corpses littering the floor. The intentionally amateurish nature of Scarlet's point of view solidified the scene, allowing the audience to actually feel the tension along with the characters. This was the most frightening scene of ""28 Weeks Later,"" and it alone shows that the filmmakers knew what they were doing. It's quite original as Zombie Films go, cleverly balancing sheer terror with drama. And yes, it also has a lot of cool makeup effects.",4,Lethal Infection,1179100800,"05 14, 2007",2007,4996,"['Danny', 'Boyle', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'put', 'interesting', 'twist', 'Zombie', 'Film',

1090818,A1DBQOB2CVLDOS,B000TJBN7Q,"Chris Van Deelen ""Chris Van Deelen""","[1, 1]","I just wonder where this particular franchise is headed... The first movie was a refreshing change of pace in the zombie genre. Yes, I said zombies, even though they weren't undead.I honestly didn't know what to expect when I first watched the movie, and I wasn't at all disappointed. Of course, when I learned that a sequel was in the works, I was both apprehensive and excited to see what they were going to do with it.Well, I can say this about the movie... it was very intense. It's not often that I watch a movie and end up coming out of it with a tension headache. But I did when I saw this in the theatre. Sadly, it doesn't translate so well to the small screen.I won't post any spoilers, so don't fret.As I said above, 28 Weeks Later is a zombie horror movie, make no mistakes about it. We all know the basic premise behind it. A virus infects people in seconds, making them homicidal. It spreads like wildfire... it takes only one infected to start a catastrophic cascade that grows exponentially.Six months after the initial outbreak of the Rage virus, Britain has been declared safe, as those who were infected starved to death, and the long difficult process of repopulating London begins.This movie deals with loss, the will to survive, and sacrifice. The truly frightening aspect of this movie is just what we would do in order to survive. The need to survive does tend to strip away the very basics of civilization in all of us.It is a horror movie, to be certain, but not in the blood and guts aspect of horror (however, be warned, there is plenty of that if you're into that sort of thing), but instead in the horror of decisions that are made.28 weeks later has all these elements. We make decisions that we have to live with every day, but this movie takes those decisions to the extreme.A social commentary? Eh, I don't think so, not like what we've seen in the past. Maybe others might see it as such, but I didn't.Sequels need to bring something new to the screen, to the canon of the franchise. 28 Weeks Later does so, in a very heart-rending way. Not literally, of course, but emotionally.And, as one would fully expect, it has been left open for a sequel. Although at the time of this review, that is in jeopardy because it didn't do all that well in the theatre. Then again, there have been dozens of movies that did poorly at the box office and were granted a sequel.Visually, it was quite stunning. The combat, without giving away any spoilers, was well done. The gore was sickeningly realistic (the one aspect that I didn't like about the movie), and the acting was believable.I was very pleased to see that Robert Carlyle had a role in the movie, and his role was pulled off beautifully.As I stated above, I still after all these months vividly remember even after an hour since  I had left the theatre, my heart was still pounding from the intensity of the movie, and it left me with one hell of a tension headache.Even now, I can honestly say that I didn't find it scary, but it was one viscerally intense film. Others might find it scary, and I wouldn't recommend allowing younger teens to watch it.My son, who has been getting into the zombie genre, still can't watch it, as the opening sequence because scared the hell out of him. Go figure, he had no problems watching the remake of Dawn of the Dead.

1090819,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000TJBN7Q,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 3]","I find myself kind of confused in regards to a couple scenes in 28 Weeks Later, the sequel to the hit 28 Days Later, in where there's quite a bit of gore thrown around. Normally I would chuckle that the filmmakers feel gore will scare rather than disgust and that we will lose sleep at night because of it. Yet I didn't mind it in 28 Weeks Later and even more still, I actually liked the movie as a whole. Wonder what happened here?About 2 months after the events of the first film, we find that the contagious disease which turns people into mindless rampagers has been contained and there's hope as well with civilians now returning to a selected area of London. But when the virus spreads, scientist Scarlet and military sniper Doyle have to take siblings Tammy and Andy, who might carry a genetic anamoly making them immune of the virus, to safety.I have to admit that I wasn't a huge fan of the original. Sure it had a good opening, what with a guy waking up to a deserted London, but after that it felt kind of downhill and when they got to the military compound, I got kinda bored. This film manages to keep up its tension and keeps the atmosphere uneasy and creepy so even if the characters are safe, they probably won't be for long. It's also a bit more ambitious scale-wise than the original and while that makes it feel less indie-horror and more studio horror, it still stands on its own.The problem with a film in the horror genre is that it doesn't really allow the characters to feel like characters but merely munchies for whatever beast is after them. Here it's a little bit different so when a character gets killed off, we actually feel sad they're gone and not just ""oop, there they go"". The film's grounded by Robert Carlyle as the dad who can lie and feel emotional and feels real. Then there's also Rose Byrne who must have a natural sympathizing quality because I never get the feeling she's just going through the motions in anything.It might not light your world on fire and be your favorite horror film ever (or zombie film for that matter) but it can probably freak you out if it can.",4,Surprising sequel...it's actually good,1192060800,"10 11, 2007",2007,2112,"['find', 'kind', 'confused', 'regards', 'couple', 'scenes', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'sequel', 'hit', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'where', 'quite', 'bit', 'gore', 'thrown', 'around', 'Normally', 'would', 'chuckle', 'filmmakers', 'feel', 'gore', 'will', 'scare', 'rather', 'disgust', 'will', 'lose', 'sleep', 'night', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'even', 'more', 'still', 'actually', 'liked', 'movie', 'whole', 'Wonder', 'what', 'happened', 'here', '2', 'months', 'events', 'first', 'film', 'find', 'contagious', 'disease', 'people', 'mindless', 'rampagers', 'been', 'contained', 'hope', 'as', 'well', 'civilians', 'now', 'returning', 'selected', 'area', 'London', 'when', 'virus', 'spreads', 'scientist', 'Scarlet', 'military', 'sniper', 'Doyle', 'have', 'take', 'siblings', 'Tammy', 'Andy', 'who', 'might', 'carry', 'genetic', 'anamoly', 'making', 'immune', 'virus', 'safety.I', 'have', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'fan', 'original', 'Sure', 'had', 'good', 'opening', 'what', 'guy', 'waking', 'up', 'deserted', 'London', 'felt', 'kind', 'downhill', 'when', 'got', 'military', 'compound', 'got', 'kinda', 'bored', 'film', 'keep', 'up', 'tension', 'atmosphere', 'uneasy', 'creepy', 'so', 'even', 'characters', 'are', 'safe', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'long', 'also', 'bit', 'more', 'ambitious', 'scale-wise', 'original', 'feel', 'less', 'indie-horror', 'more', 'studio', 'horror', 'still', 'own.The', 'problem', 'film', 'horror', 'genre', ""n't"", 'really', 'allow', 'characters', 'feel', 'characters', 'merely', 'munchies', 'whatever', 'beast', 'Here', 'little', 'bit', 'different', 'so', 'when', 'character', 'killed', 'off', 'actually', 'feel', 'sad', ""'re"", 'gone', 'not', 'just', 'oop', 'go', 'film', 'grounded', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'dad', 'who', 'can', 'lie', 'feel', 'emotional', 'feels', 'real', 'Then', 'also', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'natural', 'sympathizing', 'quality', 'never', 'get', 'feeling', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'anything.It', 'might', 'not', 'light', 'world', 'fire', 'be', 'favorite', 'horror', 'film', 'ever', 'zombie', 'film', 'matter', 'can', 'probably', 'freak', 'can']",28 Weeks Later

1090822,A6UW2KEO5UOSA,B000TJBN7Q,"Corey Turner ""The Musician""","[0, 0]","""28 Weeks Later"" starts in the same time frame of ""28 Days Later"", and ends much further. Danny Boyle did an excellent job on the first, but he's not directing this time around Juan Fresnadillo is the main man now. The movie feels very different from the first film, being a die hard fan of the first film I was ready to be over critical.Luckily the intro stirred up the same feeling received from the climactic parts of the original. After that the movie really shifts away from those ideals, and revolves more on a different approach of survival. While the rage infected civilians still play a prime role, the military becomes just as terrifying (and much more destructive). Instead of just waves of zombie like people, now explosions and helicopters make way. Snipers and turrets, fire fights, and military bases, hmmmm.Sounds a bit more like an action film huh? Indeed it is, but it adds variety to the universe. The action does seem a bit over the top at some points, but the horror still feels just as real and intense as ever.One will notice a larger budget was enabled this time, and they make sure to use it to its fullest.Story wise, the objective is much clearer then the first. Yet after the initial break out, the story takes back seat to simply surviving. 28 Days focused more on rationing and slow paced moving about. This one is breakneck speed, for if they shall halt death is imminent. This really helps the film from becoming stagnant, the way it plays out slow moments will only hinder it. I personally liked the original story more, with the initial group of survivors confused and struggling on reaching salvation. It kept us wondering where would be safe, are they just stuck wandering?  Gravitating us to feel their confusion and disbelief. 28 Weeks is less dynamic as it maintains a certain adrenaline rush spanning the entire course of the film. The music is still prominent, and knows when to cue the 'buddy hug the side of your seat, it's gonna' get creepy'.Summarizing the story, England is deemed safe to relocate to. Precautions are taken direly. The U.S. military provides consistent steak outs. Upon being dubbed safe to live in again, a civilian quarters is established. Ruins of Englands apocalyptic nightmare still strain on, all around lay blood drenched buildings. Vacant stores and vehicles residing on the streets empty as can be.  A  father reunites with his children. Children are still not allowed, but exceptions are made. Without spoiling how, an infection resurfaces. Cures have been something parallel to a dream, but recent study suggest it may be possible. With the infection virally spreading faster then wild fire, U.S. forces must cleanse the area by all means.What I really enjoyed about this film is although it takes place in a further time, you actually get to watch a breakout start. 28 Days, the protagonist awoke in a daze much after the course of the epidemic, and slowly saw it cease. A second sequel seems less trivial and more a  necessity. A third title is set to take place in Russia. The 28 series is refreshing, chaotic, and very gory. Bonus features include comics, commentary, and a few behind the scenes look at the making of.Side note, rage virus is not a zombie making mayhem. These 'zombie' like humans are fast, lethal, and blindingly angry. Infection can spread via bite, or any blood entering an open surface. Once infected, transformation is fast.28 weeks is an impressive sequel, that avoids treading the same territory twice. A film worth the while of viewing, and hopefully good enough to get viewers into the first film (if they haven't seen it already).",4,Watch An Epidemic Unfold,1226275200,"11 10, 2008",2008,3635,"['28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'same', 'time', 'frame', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'much', 'further', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'first', 'not', 'directing', 'time', 'Juan', 'Fresnadillo', 'main', 'man', 'now', 'movie', 'very', 'different', 'first', 'film', 'being', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'ready', 'be', 'critical.Luckily', 'intro', 'stirred', 'up', 'same', 'feeling', 'received', 'climactic', 'parts', 'original', 'movie', 'really', 'shifts', 'away', 'ideals', 'more', 'different', 'approach', 'survival', 'rage', 'infected', 'civilians', 'still', 'play', 'prime', 'role', 'military', 'becomes', 'just', 'terrifying', 'much', 'more', 'destructive', 'Instead', 'just', 'waves', 'zombie', 'people', 'now', 'explosions', 'helicopters', 'make', 'way', 'Snipers', 'turrets', 'fire', 'fights', 'military', 'bases', 'bit', 'more', 'action', 'film', 'huh', 'Indeed', 'variety', 'universe', 'action', 'seem', 'bit', 'top', 'points', 'horror', 'still', 'just', 'real', 'intense', 'ever.One', 'will', 'notice', 'larger', 'budget', 'was', 'enabled', 'time', 'make', 'sure', 'use', 'fullest.Story', 'wise', 'objective', 'much', 'clearer', 'then', 'first', 'initial', 'break', 'story', 'back', 'seat', 'simply', 'surviving', '28', 'Days', 'focused', 'more', 'rationing', 'slow', 'paced', 'moving', 'about', 'one', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'shall', 'halt', 'death', 'imminent', 'really', 'film', 'becoming', 'stagnant', 'way', 'out', 'slow', 'moments', 'will', 'only', 'hinder', 'personally', 'liked', 'original', 'story', 'more', 'initial', 'group', 'survivors', 'confused', 'struggling', 'reaching', 'salvation', 'kept', 'wondering', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'safe', 'are', 'just', 'stuck', 'wandering', 'Gravitating', 'feel', 'confusion', 'disbelief', '28', 'Weeks', 'less', 'dynamic', 'certain', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'spanning', 'entire', 'course', 'film', 'music', 'still', 'prominent', 'when', 'cue', ""'buddy"", 'hug', 'side', 'seat', 'gon', 'get', ""creepy'.Summarizing"", 'story', 'England', 'deemed', 'safe', 'relocate', 'Precautions', 'are', 'taken', 'direly', 'U.S.', 'military', 'consistent', 'steak', 'outs', 'being', 'dubbed', 'safe', 'live', 'again', 'civilian', 'quarters', 'established', 'Ruins', 'Englands', 'apocalyptic', 'nightmare', 'still', 'strain', 'lay', 'blood', 'drenched', 'buildings', 'Vacant', 'stores', 'vehicles', 'residing', 'streets', 'empty', 'can', 'be', 'father', 'children', 'Children', 'are', 'still', 'not', 'allowed', 'exceptions', 'are', 'made', 'spoiling', 'how', 'infection', 'resurfaces', 'Cures', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'parallel', 'dream', 'recent', 'study', 'suggest', 'may', 'be', 'possible', 'infection', 'virally', 'spreading', 'faster', 'then', 'wild', 'fire', 'U.S.', 'forces', 'must', 'cleanse', 'area', 'means.What', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'place', 'further', 'time', 'actually', 'get', 'watch', 'breakout', 'start', '28', 'Days', 'protagonist', 'awoke', 'daze', 'much', 'course', 'epidemic', 'slowly', 'saw', 'cease', 'second', 'sequel', 'less', 'trivial', 'more', 'necessity', 'third', 'title', 'set', 'take', 'place', 'Russia', '28', 'series', 'refreshing', 'chaotic', 'very', 'gory', 'Bonus', 'include', 'comics', 'commentary', 'few', 'scenes', 'look', 'making', 'of.Side', 'note', 'rage', 'virus', 'not', 'zombie', 'making', 'mayhem', 'humans', 'are', 'fast', 'lethal', 'blindingly', 'angry', 'Infection', 'can', 'spread', 'bite', 'blood', 'entering', 'open', 'surface', 'Once', 'infected', 'transformation', 'fast.28', 'weeks', 'impressive', 'sequel', 'treading', 'same', 'territory', 'twice', 'A', 'film', 'while', 'viewing', 'hopefully', 'good', 'enough', 'get', 'viewers', 'first', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'already']",28 Weeks Later

I still can't see how any horror fan could rank either film as among the best zombie films ever made, though - there are just too many problems in evidence.It's been six months since the ""Rage"" virus outbreak in Britain has been contained, and some civilians are now being allowed back into London - into a highly secure sector tightly controlled by the American military. You don't get in without a thorough medical examination, and the military are everywhere, from boots on the ground to eyes in the air to snipers on top of buildings. Yep, nobody's getting in or out of this place without authorization. Nothing could possibly go wrong here. Not even Houdini could possibly manage to evade all of this security.The movie opens quite effectively, with a group of survivors holed up in a house having their dinner ruined by a full-scale onslaught of zombies. In a scene that forces you to wonder what you would do in the same situation, Don (Robert Carlyle) cowardly leaves his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack) behind order to save his own ass. When his kids Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) and Tammy (Imogen Poots) arrive back in new London from wherever they have been, he gives them an edited version of their mom's death. Now, you would think that two kids, one of whom is almost an adult (not to mention exceedingly hot), having already lost their mother to the virus, would never even dream of leaving the safety of their new home to wander out into the forbidden zone. Of course, you would also think that this tightly secured zone would at least have a gate or something to prevent that very thing from happening. Alas, no. Something potentially good actually comes from their escapade, though, as a survivor is found who is seemingly immune to the virus raging in her system. Now, you would think such an important medical subject would be watched and guarded more closely than Fort Knox, yet someone easily waltzes into her room, does something really stupid, and becomes infected. Once the authorities figure out what has happened, they immediately go to Code Red and lock the place down. Civilians are huddled into ""secure"" areas - unfortunately, just turning the lights off doesn't do much good if you're going to leave a door to the place all but wide open. Can you see a pattern here? Too little too late doesn't even begin to describe the security problems in evidence all throughout this film.Anyway, the second half of the film consists of a race for survival, as Tammy, Andy, and a few others run for their lives from both the increasing numbers of brand-new zombies and the military forces out to exterminate them and everyone else in the infected sector. This is where the film really hits its stride, throwing numerous scenes of blood, explosions, and carnage at the viewer. It's good stuff, no doubt about it - not to mention timely. As the film's few good characters fell by the wayside, I cared less and less about those who remained (especially the annoying boy). I still consider the first film the gorier of the two, however, mainly because there are far less zombies vomiting up blood all over the place in this sequel.The ending of 28 Weeks Later obviously lays the groundwork for a third film in the series, so expect a question or two to go unanswered here. While I was not anxious to see any sequel to the disappointing 28 Days Later, the improvements seen in this film give me hope that a third movie would definitely have potential. The ""less plot, more action"" approach so in evidence here indicates to me that director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo recognized the extent of the plot problems inherent in Danny Boyle's original film, so the third time might truly be the charm.",4,A much better film than its predecessor,1202515200,"02 9, 2008",2008,3910,"['was', 'minority', 'hardcore', 'horror', 'fans', 'who', 'found', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'be', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'number', 'reasons', 'have', 'say', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'predecessor', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'horror', 'fan', 'could', 'rank', 'either', 'film', 'best', 'zombie', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'problems', 'evidence.It', 'been', 'six', 'months', 'Rage', 'virus', 'outbreak', 'Britain', 'been', 'contained', 'civilians', 'are', 'now', 'being', 'allowed', 'back', 'London', 'highly', 'secure', 'sector', 'tightly', 'controlled', 'American', 'military', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'thorough', 'medical', 'examination', 'military', 'are', 'everywhere', 'boots', 'ground', 'eyes', 'air', 'snipers', 'top', 'buildings', 'Yep', 'nobody', 'getting', 'place', 'authorization', 'Nothing', 'could', 'possibly', 'go', 'wrong', 'here', 'Not', 'even', 'Houdini', 'could', 'possibly', 'manage', 'evade', 'security.The', 'movie', 'quite', 'effectively', 'group', 'survivors', 'holed', 'up', 'house', 'having', 'dinner', 'ruined', 'full-scale', 'onslaught', 'zombies', 'scene', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'same', 'situation', 'Don', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'cowardly', 'wife', 'Alice', 'Catherine', 'McCormack', 'order', 'save', 'own', 'ass', 'When', 'kids', 'Andy', 'Mackintosh', 'Muggleton', 'Tammy', 'Imogen', 'Poots', 'arrive', 'back', 'new', 'London', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'version', 'mom', 'death', 'Now', 'would', 'think', 'two', 'kids', 'one', 'whom', 'almost', 'adult', 'not', 'mention', 'exceedingly', 'hot', 'having', 'already', 'lost', 'mother', 'virus', 'would', 'never', 'even', 'dream', 'leaving', 'safety', 'new', 'home', 'wander', 'out', 'forbidden', 'zone', 'course', 'would', 'also', 'think', 'tightly', 'secured', 'zone', 'would', 'least', 'have', 'gate', 'something', 'prevent', 'very', 'thing', 'happening', 'Alas', 'Something', 'potentially', 'good', 'actually', 'escapade', 'though', 'survivor', 'found', 'who', 'seemingly', 'immune', 'virus', 'raging', 'system', 'Now', 'would', 'think', 'important', 'medical', 'subject', 'would', 'be', 'watched', 'guarded', 'more', 'closely', 'Fort', 'Knox', 'yet', 'someone', 'easily', 'room', 'something', 'really', 'stupid', 'becomes', 'infected', 'authorities', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'immediately', 'go', 'Code', 'Red', 'lock', 'place', 'down', 'Civilians', 'are', 'huddled', 'secure', 'areas', 'unfortunately', 'just', 'turning', 'lights', 'off', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'good', ""'re"", 'going', 'leave', 'door', 'place', 'wide', 'open', 'Can', 'see', 'pattern', 'here', 'Too', 'little', 'too', 'late', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'describe', 'security', 'problems', 'evidence', 'film.Anyway', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'race', 'survival', 'Tammy', 'Andy', 'few', 'others', 'run', 'lives', 'increasing', 'numbers', 'brand-new', 'zombies', 'military', 'forces', 'out', 'exterminate', 'everyone', 'else', 'infected', 'sector', 'where', 'film', 'really', 'stride', 'throwing', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'blood', 'explosions', 'carnage', 'viewer', 'good', 'stuff', 'doubt', 'not', 'mention', 'timely', 'film', 'few', 'good', 'characters', 'fell', 'wayside', 'cared', 'less', 'less', 'who', 'remained', 'especially', 'annoying', 'boy', 'still', 'consider', 'first', 'film', 'gorier', 'two', 'however', 'mainly', 'are', 'far', 'less', 'zombies', 'vomiting', 'up', 'blood', 'place', 'sequel.The', 'ending', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'obviously', 'groundwork', 'third', 'film', 'series', 'expect', 'question', 'two', 'go', 'unanswered', 'here', 'was', 'not', 'anxious', 'see', 'sequel', 'disappointing', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'improvements', 'seen', 'film', 'give', 'hope', 'third', 'movie', 'would', 'definitely', 'have', 'potential', 'less', 'plot', 'more', 'action', 'approach', 'so', 'evidence', 'here', 'director', 'Juan', 'Carlos', 'Fresnadillo', 'recognized', 'extent', 'plot', 'problems', 'inherent', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'original', 'film', 'third', 'time', 'might', 'truly', 'be', 'charm']",28 Weeks Later

1090830,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B000TJBN7Q,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[4, 10]","Here's a joke in the grim years after the devastation of the Rage Virus was released from a London biological research lab, ripping through the population like a blood-engrimed scythe & devastating the UK---you ready?OK, here goes: two guys are chilling outside of the Safe Zone, right? And one guy looks over this brick wall they're standing next to, freaks out, and yells ""Oh my God, it's one of the Infected---he's coming this way!""And the other guy, he doesn't say anything, but he gets these brand new running shoes out of his rucksack and starts putting them on, tying up the shoelaces, the works, right? And the other guy is looking at him like he's gone crazy, and he says ""what the bleeding 'Ell are you doing? Those things have Rage---they run like they've got a howitzer mounted in their [EXPLETIVES]! You can't outrun those zombies!""And the other guy just smiles and takes off, saying: ""I don't have to outrun the zombies. I just have to outrun you.""I made that joke up about 15 minutes in to watching ""28 Weeks Later"", the utterly uninspired sequel to one of the most nightmarish flicks I have ever seen, Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"".Now it's true that director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo had some mighty big directorial Wellingtons to fill: Boyle is a demented visionary and an absolute guerrilla warrior with his directing. Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" could have been a dippy little coda or sideshow to the 2002 onslaught of zombie flicks.But Boyle brought a silver ewer brimming with gory cinematic deviltry and---of all things!---dignity, to his End of the World flick. The result was brooding, elegant, gory, nasty, & insanely scary, a throbbing mainline right to the jugular of post-9/11's deepest, darkest fears.The sequel has the same trappings: the Sprinting Dead, zombies who do wind sprints to get you, tear your guts out, and then try out for the Iron Man triathlon afterwards. It has the Military, with their nifty gas masks & black battle armor & Happy Thoughts amped through the City of London, where evacuees have finally been allowed to return, 28 months later, after the American military has cleared the City of the Rage virus.You've also got the trademark Big Red Clotted Gory Puke Sequences (tm), where the jetting spew is of the extra-chunky Vegetable Soup variety. And there is a sweet, razor-blade instant of pure shrill terror during a sequence of rampant pre-quarantine madness at an English cottage which lopes along after the film's intro credits (though Boyle directed it, surprise!).Bottom-line, ""28 Weeks Later"" is like a bunch of grad students messing around with lab rats. Dump the Brits back in London; have a few grunts play peeping Tom with the starlight scope; wait for, as they say in Jurassic Park, ""life to find a way."" Life does, the Military uber-FUBARS it, & before you can say ""would you like a side-order of red puke with your order, Sir?"" London is, yet again, crawling with the wild-eyed infected, doing their yark-yarking thing all over again. Ugh.It's watchable, but only just. Amazingly, the sequel manages to take all that awesome fear, tension, and terror and totally jettison it out the airlock.But the concept still has promise, which is why I hope Boyle takes a final cut at this thing. However you want to frame it, Boyle's monsters, running zombies are utterly terrifying. The regular Romero-style lumbering dead are bad enough: given enough time & ample exhaustion on your part, they'll get you. But the sprinting dead---these zombies that run after you---that's just too much.If you don't agree, if you're not feeling it right now, then take a second and just think about the prospect. I just walked through my empty office this evening, out to the foyer, and into the can. I was in there about 2 minutes. I walked back out & the elevator slid open, and two guys---two mechanics, techs for the ventilation system---jogged out, totally spooked me flat-out bugshxt.I gotta admit, man, it kinda unnerved me. If those dudes had been infected?---OK, you're with me.Cool. Let's move on.That's what works about the whole 28 days later thing, what worked about the original, what even worked about Zach Tyler's terminally unsettling reworking of ""Dawn of the Dead"": these undead, hungry, hateful, baleful, gibbering things running at you with murder in their eyes and a-growling in the belly, before you can prepare. That's it, isn't it? You're not ready.The Running Zombie doesn't give a man a decent getting-ready time. It's like the [NAUGHTY WORD] in hide-n-seek years ago who would pretend to be counting to 100 and then go ""38, 37, 36,---3, 2, 1 HERE I COME!"" and everyone would panic. With a [EXPLETIVE] like that on board, those hide & seeks would become bloodbaths.So I guess what it all boils down to is this: quarantine this flick. Numero 2 doesn't move, it doesn't groove, it doesn't boogy, it doesn't scare me, & I can't dance to it.And pray for a follow-up that shows us something *really* scary.JSG",2,"Rage, Rage!---against the

This sequel lives up to its entertaining predecessor and may actually be better than the first!The story picks up six months after the virus ravaged London, with a couple (played by Catherine McCormack and the talented Robert Carlyle) who are living with a group of survivors in a boarded up home.  Soon, however, their quiet hideaway is attacked by a group of blood thirsty ""ragers"" and Carlyle's character shows his true cowardly nature, leaving behind his wife to be killed and saving himself, above all others.When we next see (Carlyle) he is being reunited with his children in an area sanctioned off by the US government and Nato.  With snipers set up to watch the safe zone and giving complete medical exams to clear the returning citizens, the project looks to be a successful attempt to eradicate the virus infected zombies and the virus itself.  But when the couple's two children escape the safe zone, return to their old home and find their mother, still very much alive, the virus returns.  Though the mother doesn't exhibit the signs of the zombies, she carries the disease and can still transfer it, setting a course for the return of the blood spewing zombies.  However, the mother, because she is genetically immune to the symptoms (and possibly her children as well) is an important key in fighting the virus and the chance of truely stopping it from spreading.Juan Carlos Fresnadillo does a good job of following the lead of the first director but upping the action a bit for the second go around. Robert Carlyle does a great job as a very flawed man who will do anything to survive, including turning his back on his own family.

However, 28 Weeks Later was simply an attempt to make money off a well done original.  The movie was had plot holes the size of the Wembley Stadium roof.  First of all, why is the U.S. Army in charge of London?  Where are the British officers and government officials?  Armies place troops all over the world.  Doesn't it make sense that England would recall some of its own troops to London to oversee the U.S. Army initiative?  And, the British Government, like our own U.S. Government (as our Cabinet jumps on Air Force One during a crisis), would have fled London immediately at the first sign of the original rage.  The royal family and parliament would have been safe elsewhere outside of London proper, allowing them to return to govern at a later time?  Where was the British government in the film?  AND, what 6th sense did the Father who contracted the Rage Virus have in order to end up in Wembley Stadium to pursue his children after his children needed a vehicle to get there?  AND, for that matter, if the mother of the children, and the wife of the father, was a Rage carrier and in medical isolation, where was the guard to keep her isolated?  Instead, the husband/father walks in and gives her a kiss to become infected?  WOW!

The existence of this sequel testifies to the fact that this does not go smoothly.This ultraviolent film is superior to the first, which had a very lackluster ending.  The vision of director/co-writer Juan Carlos Fresnadillo and co-writers Rowan Joffe, E.L. Lavigne, and Jesus Olmo is bleak, uncompromising, and even heart-breaking.

1090837,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B000TJBN7Q,Dr. E,"[0, 0]","A watershed film, Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" was a gripping hybrid ... a zombie art-film. Boyle showcased his talents as a world-renowned director while creating a work that left cosmopolitan horror-enthusiasts in awe. Aside from the gorgeous cinematography, ""28 Days Later"" recognized the original intent of zombie-film: to act as social commentary. ""White Zombie"" (1932) and ""Revolt of the Zombie"" (1936) set a historical tone for zombie-film which was somewhat lost after Romero's trilogy. But Boyle revived the zombie-film in 2002 ... giving zombie-fans and academics a reason to love zombies again!""28 Weeks Later"" has Boyle's fingerprints all over the film (he was, in fact, involved in some of the directing): 1.) Robert Carlyle is cast in a lead role (you may know him as Begbie from Boyle's ""Trainspotting,"" 2.) the soundtrack is a continuation of John Murphy's original score (in fact, I heard variations on the track ""The Tunnel"" throughout the film,) 3.) it uses Boyle's trademark bridge-shots, and 4.) it employs Boyle's use of a digital format.The film itself is fast-paced, action-heavy, and extraordinarily tense. It is shocking and gripping. Unlike ""28 Days Later,"" the film opens with a ""weak"" but sympathetic character who is trapped in a heinous lie ... which ultimately leads to the second outbreak. It is an ""edge-of-your-seat nail-biter."" Quite literally, I never heard one audience member utter a single word through the duration of the work. It offers not a moment for reflection ... it is completely relentless. Perhaps not until the drive home will you decide if you liked the film or not ... or even begin to process it.Now, it must be said that there were some failings. **SPOILERS** Foremost, the recycling of thumb-through-the-eyes assault was less an homage to the original than a needless repetition. Second, while Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" delivers the horrific tales of Infection through narration (Jim was comatose throughout the spread), this film actually shows the audience the carnage in close-quarters. While some may find this thrilling, many will find it gratuitous. To clarify, when asked to name the bloodiest horror-film of all-time, people inevitably say ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" ... but Hooper's film is a virtually bloodless work. What's the relevance, you ask? On-screen violence tends to be less potent than the violence an audience member IMAGINE. (Which is why Nispel's remake of ""TCM"" was a critical failure). Moreover, the conclusion can be predicted in the first twenty-minutes of the film which may leave you a little frustrated. (But it's still a great conclusion!!) Finally, while the soundtrack echoes the original film, the attention granted to the first film was lacking here. ""28 Days Later"" had a cutting-edge appeal: including ""God Speed You Black Emperor"" and excerpts from Faur&eacute;'s ""Requiem"" (namely ""In Paradisum"") on the same soundtrack was brilliant!! I wish there was more diversity in this new work ... instead, with one exception, the soundtrack is a rehash of the instrumental work from ""28 Days Later.""Still, the attention to detail is fantastic!! Something for which to watch ... note that when Doyle selects a horse on the carousel, he chooses one named ""Zed."" ""Zed,"" as you know, is the British word for ""Z"" ... and is often used as a way to refer to zombies (see ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""World War Z""!!) Just a neat homage to other zombies films and literature!!While the film lacks the character-development of the original, it is ambitious and exciting. Though it can never compare to the original, it will not disappoint!!

The greatest example of this is returning people to a segment of London, supposedly clean, while just a few blocks away there were still bodies lying around.  Health issues aside...how do you keep people from roaming into unsanitary areas (which they didn't, two strayed)?  The BIG question being, why the rush to return people to an unsafe area, other than providing the story with a very convenient reason for mayhem to follow/continue.  AND, how did the dad (Robert Carlyle) happen to have the unerring knack of finding them no matter where there went/hid?  That went well beyond convenient and into the arena of being just a plot ploy.I was also a little put off by the obvious distain for Americans, the military in general, by the filmmakers.  It wasn't necessary to the plot so one suspects a little bias on their part.

I have always liked him especially his performance in the great flick Dahmer. So when this first came out I was really excited but this did not turn out as great as I thought. Still the movie was fun and had a bit of that appeal that the first did although I think it was trying to hard to live up to the first. Renner definitely is what makes this movie for me, and once again they are infected not zombies.The second film follows a some people who get stuck within an infected zone after an infected gets loose, the husband and wife. These people are being lead by a solider who feels sorry for them and disobeys orders and even shoots his fellow soldiers. They have to make it all the way across town to try to get a lift out of the quarantined zone. They have to out last a lot of infected, soldiers, napalm and all kinds of things. This one unlike the last film is a straight survival film were as the last was a mix of all kinds.This movie seemed well directed and written for the most part but it seemed like they were trying to out do the last film more so than further the story. Don't get me wrong I love when the helicopter starts to chop away at the infected but did it feel a little like the studio was involved in stuff like that. To me the story seemed great at first but towards the last half it did not seem as developed. In fact the first half felt very much like the first film but it started to falter towards the end a little. Acting wise Jeremy Renner is brilliant but I was a little disappointed with the fate of his character, Robert Carlyle is also great in this.I liked this second film and found it to be a fun flick but it did not seem as real as the first or even as fun. The story was good and the acting was good but it just fell a little short in my opinion. I would still recommend a purchase especially if you have the first one but a rental at least could be good for this one.

That said...I loved the first movie. Hands down. So I had mild expectations for this, but it dashed even the lowest bar.The concept was good. The IDEA I liked. The execution wasn't worth the film it was put on. The plot and ending was completely and easily figured out in the first 30 minutes. The first five minutes was the ONLY good part. The rest went from painstakingly slow to freakishly quick and predictable.*edit*- spoilers *end edit*Strike 1-unbelievable, very unrealistic. The fact that so many incidences were because of character COMPLETE AND UTTER stupidity disappointed me. That 2 kids want to go on an ""adventure"" considering the devastation that occured, knowing that people were brutally murdered, knowing how contagious the virus was, having to steal bike keys from the hands of a dead zombie and still happy and laughing?Strike 2- the fact that they give UNLIMITED ACCESS to EVERYTHING to any of the survivors they found. That would NEVER happen and the fact that they say the military would do that is laughable. The military doesn't even trust regular citizens with INFORMATION, so I couldn't believe they would give that kind of access in that kind of situation and think everything was going to be hunky dory.Strike 3- The way that they (as in the people trying to save them) knew that the kids could genetically be carriers and were trying to release them over the channel instead of taking them to a base, where they might be killed but had a better chance than on their own, knowing that they could have been infected already (since they found the mother who was also infected and highly contagious).The only 2 people I actually cared about was the sniper (Oh, he was cute) and the helicopter pilot (ah, that's not cool). As you can see, it wasn't even a deep sense of caring. The other main characters (not the extras, they don't really count) got less than what they deserved. And France too (just kidding! couldn't help it! :D )The only reason I can recommend this movie without hating myself is that you can get it along with the first one for a good price.

Given they are so whacked out as to not be able to even feed themselves -- we are told that everyone infected the first time around is dead of starvation -- how are they able to resist going after each other?  Another point:  Would the authorities really be intent on repopulating London so soon after the infection?  If they were, shouldn't they have done a better job of guarding the ways into and out of the ""green zone""?  Why have armed guards posted every two feet inside the quarantined area and then have few guards at the entrances?  The two kids have no trouble sneaking out, so you would expect the infected would have had little trouble breaking in.  And given how important the infected -- but asymptomatic -- mother is, why wouldn't she be guarded more closely?  The father is able to visit her without much trouble.  They have all these guards everywhere and then when they have an infected person on their hands, they don't bother to guard her closely?

It's a bit too active and it seems that the director is trying too hard to create an impact.28 Weeks Later does create an impact, in the sense it is still a must watch film but there is nothing about the film that deserves recognition or respect. It tries to incorporate a whole lot in a space of way less than 2hours. A lot of readers/posters/critics on imdb.com wrote this is one of the best films they saw in 2007. I can see what they could have liked about this film but I must say, in my heart of hearts, it is quite underwhelming.Watch [...] and figure out how it had those 4minute action scenes. There were maybe 2 scenes in the film that made me jump from my seat. The film,overall, though would still remain disappointing. However, I would not like to pull you away from it. Watch it cause you might just like it or you might just end up finding I make sense to more than just myself.Try watching ""[...]"" - a good effort and it doesn't try to change the world.

1090862,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000TJBN7Q,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Yet one more commentary on man's folly, 28 WEEKS LATER brings us back to that place of stark, stark terror and dead end fortunes: London. It's 28 weeks later, and things look to be safe now for the repatriation of a desiccated city. Fifteen thousand civilians have already been allowed to move in again, under the watchful eye of the U.S. Army. But one survivor turns up who is found to be immune to the rage virus, an immense discovery which could potentially lead to a cure. But it's a double-edged sword, as this survivor now also becomes an Infection carrier - as everyone soon horrifyingly finds out. So, 28 weeks later, it all begins again.No, this one isn't as good as28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition), which set a new and stylish benchmark for horror. 28 WEEKS LATER, while sleek and scary and shot with vitality, doesn't quite give off that same vibe of bleakness and hopeless inevitability. This one also has a faster pace and more action. But both 28 DAYS LATER and this sequel aren't about saving the world or finding a cure. No, they're about sheer survival, about getting the eff out of Dodge without getting mangled or bitten or gouged or snacked on. And it's about fighting as hard as you can for your loved ones and friends. Because of this, these films tend to affect us more on a personal, primal level. These panicky, desperate characters resonate more with us. We're no brilliant scientists or superheroes out to save the day; we're basic blokes trying to make it out alive. And these films, they'll slug you in the gut.The premise unerringly targets one fear within us all: fear of the virus, whether it's the flu virus or the plague or, heck, even a computer virus. There's just something so frightening and debilitating about an infection which leaves us helpless and which could spread so widely, rapidly, and exponentially and seemingly has no cure. The monsters here aren't really zombies in the old-fashioned sense. They don't crave to munch on your brains. Instead, they're fueled with an unquenchable and mindless rage. They'll run you down and catch you and inflict massive pain and intolerable violations upon your person. If they happen to munch on your brains, it'll probably be accidental. Another factor which punches up the horrormeter needle is that the Infected aren't slow or shambling like your grandfather's zombies. Instead, these are savage, bestial wackjobs who chase down their victims with electrifying alacrity.Don't look for the characters in the first film; they're not here. The focus instead is on a tiny band of folks, which includes a sister and her little brother (who also might be immune), a military medical officer, and an intrepid Army sergeant. As they struggle to flee to safety, they not only must elude the murderous Infected but also the military, whose mandate has been drastically elevated to Code Red, which basically means that the fit's hit the shan and now all civilians are considered lost causes. These kinds of films, I really hate it when I find myself pulling for a character. I know the odds are my favorite might buy it at any given moment. It's doubly chancy when you happen to like a lot of them. Those four I mentioned? I liked them all. It's a pity.You get caught up in the oppresive mood of the film. First of all, the chilling, driving score will make certain of that. And the very good and willing cast won't let you down, either. I started getting that edgy, crawling-under-the-skin feeling right from the opening minutes, and when that knock rapped on that door, brother, I was already yelling at the screen: ""Don't you open that bloody door!"" But of course they did. Then come the first bits of horror. But don't get the impression that it's all remorseless terror and jugular veins getting munched. There are let-ups and times for winding downs, fleeting though they are, and, admittedly, there isn't much respite in the latter half of the film. But juxtaposed with the bloodletting and -curdling are moments of serenity and sweetness, as when Andy and Tammy motorbike it back to their home and we get to enjoy the tranquil, eerily empty streets of London. But, of course, that's only to set you up. There are several disturbing and graphic scenes and a harrowing sequence staged in a pitch dark, subterranean setting, with a rifle nightscope as the sole means of vision.A bit now on the special features, which are actually worth spending time on: there's the pretty interesting audio commentary by the film's director and producer, both of whom share co-writing honors; 2 deleted scenes (a cafeteria scene and Andy's fractured subway dream) with optional commentary; the 13-minute-long ""Code Red: the Making Of"" featurette; ""The Infected"" featurette- (7 minutes long, and you get to meet the Infected movement advisor); the ""Getting Into the Action"" featurette (7 minutes); 2 so-so animated graphic novels: Stage 1 -""Development"" (7 minutes long - featuring Warren and Clive, who, while attempting to invent a rage inhibitor, unwittingly give rise instead to the Rage Virus) and Stage 3 - ""Decimation"" (4 and a half minutes long - two humans in an Infected-populated London battle it out); and, naturally, the theatrical trailer.An expert exercise in evoking goose bumps and night chills, 28 WEEKS LATER might also leave you a bit depressed and maybe even wrung out. But in a good way.",4,"""Hey, look, kids, there's Big Be - aaarrgh!""

The opening sequence and the sequences with the snipers firing indiscriminating at the fleeing crowd below were very memorable and well executed. However, I was completely bugged about how simple it was for the father to access his wife who was supposed to be in some type of quarantine. I know that there are often lapses in logic and suspensions of disbelief in many movies and I am guilty of succumbing  to some of them. But this to me was a very glaring one .For crying out loud, either the US Military was completely incompetent or the filmmakers didn't think it would be that glaring to the audience. Who in their right mind not put the mother in quarantine with at least one guard at the door let alone a nurse or technician monitoring her?????? Instead the facility was deserted. It was just too simple for the father to access her with a pass card or not. If a person was still found to be alive 28 weeks later with no symptoms in a quarantined zone in the real world, that person would be locked up and video monitored 24/7 for days if not weeks because they want to know how she survived and how she was ""immune"" to this virus. Such precautions would never be taken this lightly especially when you're dealing with a virus that nearly wiped out a whole country! If they didn't have strict protocals we would have been wiped out as a race a long time ago.The suspension of disbelief in this movie really prevented me from enjoying a pretty well made film.",2,Well made but...........,1200096000,"01 12, 2008",2008,1514,"['very', 'well', 'made', 'nicely', 'shot', 'sequel', 'opening', 'sequence', 'sequences', 'snipers', 'firing', 'indiscriminating', 'fleeing', 'crowd', 'were', 'very', 'memorable', 'well', 'executed', 'However', 'was', 'completely', 'bugged', 'how', 'simple', 'was', 'father', 'access', 'wife', 'who', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'type', 'quarantine', 'know', 'are', 'often', 'lapses', 'logic', 'suspensions', 'disbelief', 'many', 'movies', 'am', 'guilty', 'succumbing', 'was', 'very', 'glaring', 'one', '.For', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'US', 'Military', 'was', 'completely', 'incompetent', 'filmmakers', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'glaring', 'audience', 'Who', 'right', 'mind', 'not', 'put', 'mother', 'quarantine', 'least', 'one', 'guard', 'door', 'let', 'alone', 'nurse', 'technician', 'monitoring', 'Instead', 'facility', 'was', 'deserted', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'simple', 'father', 'access', 'pass', 'card', 'not', 'person', 'was', 'still', 'found', 'be', 'alive', '28', 'weeks', 'later', 'symptoms', 'quarantined', 'zone', 'real', 'world', 'person', 'would', 'be', 'locked', 'up', 'video', 'monitored', '24/7', 'days', 'not', 'weeks', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'survived', 'how', 'was', 'immune', 'virus', 'Such', 'precautions', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'taken', 'lightly', 'especially', 'when', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'virus', 'nearly', 'wiped', 'out', 'whole', 'country', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'strict', 'protocals', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'wiped', 'out', 'race', 'long', 'time', 'ago.The', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'movie', 'really', 'prevented', 'enjoying', 'pretty', 'well', 'made', 'film']",28 Weeks Later

In fact, 28 Weeks later is not just as good as the original, but probably better, at least in my opinion.I was a grand fan of the first film (minus the ending and some cheap plot planning), but needless to say, I was even more impressed by 28 Weeks Later.So what works here?The Plot - First off, they did an incredible job of mixing it up a bit. I guess they're stating a trend now in the film industry, where some talented people are allowed to experiment and throw out some genuinely new things. Case-in-point...I never expected some of the twists that I saw in this movie. If you're sick of the same old endings, the same old hero movies, this one will rock your socks off. It's basically like Saving Private Ryan with zombies...well done.Special Effects- Obviously big-budgeted, so I don't have to go into too much detail here. You can expect the pros. However, I want to add that they had some good effects and some rather questionable ones. But the mix doesn't really upset me too much. Overall, you get a great dose of zombie gore.Camera- Well, on a pro movie, you'd expect pro things, but sometimes they'll throw in a little bit of cheapness to bring out that classic effect. A lot of the camera-work in this film was handheld...and not too steady at that (feel a headache coming on?)...eh, it's not that bad. It's that amateur edge that almost makes it feel as if it was shot by a trembling newscaster from time to time. They didn't skimp on the cranes and pods, but it was an interesting effect that for the most part, I enjoyed.In any case, the huge sets, big guns, extreme action, and wonderful plot twists make this an excellent addition to any horror film collection...and obviously a must have for all zombie fans.

1090869,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B000TJBN7Q,I'm Right,"[5, 6]","28 Days Later was an excellent horror movie that revived the zombie genre (before 14 year old kids who laugh at Chuck Norris jokes and masturbate to 300 killed it again) similar to Romero's Night of the Living Dead. So director Juan Tacos Burritos took the next logical step in the story and centered it around the military trying to re-establish civilization in a small sect in London called district 1, even though London all around them still rots with dead bodies and likely still harbors the infection.Anyways one of the characters played by Robert Caryle survived the outbreak and is given the job of caretaker, where he has access to everywhere inside the district assigned by the military... why? The movie never hints that he was in the military, he doesn't act like a military man and sure doesn't walk like one, so either the army is handing out these extrodinarily private security tasks to random civilians or the movie needs plot convenience to move along.So Robert Caryle's two kids Maggintoggle Poots and Imogen Toots reunite with him and miss their mother, so they decide to sneak back into infected unsafe London to grab memorabillia and pictures, because patience is for suckaz. So two little kids sneak out of a heavily armed and guarded military base that is under heavy survellience by going on the side of one of the bridges, don't worry as the movie progresses you'll come to realize this is the most inept militia ever. Eventually they discover their mother in their old house, who's still alive and dormantly carries the infection in her. But if she can do that, other people presumably can too, but you never see them in 28 Days Later, so I just presumed that they got beaten to death or something when this plot point came up. However the mother who was in a house in the excellent opening sequence got trapped in a room with the infected flooding in, they didn't beat her to death? Did they leave her alone, because they could sense the infection or something? Did they just puke blood on her and leave? Not really a plot hole but something that bothered me.So the military scientist's find out about the mom's situation and leave her restrained in a room with 0 guards and non-monitered survellience. Robert Caryle, using his handy dandy plot inconvienience card get past all the sercurity to the detained rare subject who can be the cure to infection, and after leaving her to die decides to start macking on her, knowing fully well about the infection, that she was left out in the infected London wastes, and not even asking what she went through, decides to start sharing saliva with her, until suprise suprise, he gets infected. Now many of my friends have argued whether or not she did that on purpose to get revenge, but if she indeed infect her husband out of revenge she got brutally killed afterwards, hundreds of people died, and her kids lives were in peril, so yeah, great revenge plan mom.So the now-infected Robert Caryle (probably still weilding his access card) runs around the military compound and kills multiple soldier's who were presumably trained to deal with the infected, and ends up killing all of them. One unarmed infected man without armor vs approximately twenty armed guards. Hm. The rest of the military is alerted and stuffs all of the civillians in a dark cramped basement for their safety, forgetting that the back door is unlocked and Robert Caryle-zombie has apparently found it and broke in. Now people have compared this level of military incompetance to the American troops in the Middle East, politics aside that sounds like a slap-dash excuse of ""oh yeah, we meant for those soldiers to be s***ty at their jobs, see it's like topical and current!"" I don't buy it.So the people start pouring out of the basement out into the streets were snipers are poised, and chaos breaks out via shakey cam and the snipers shoot to kill everyone basically, wait are the military guys incompetent fools? I don't understand, please movie, spell that point out for me more. So the people in hiding are intercepted by two soldiers, Jermey Renner and Rose Byrne who try to protect the people and escort them out. Eventually the group is literally chased out of the city by an explosion and into the outskirts while the city is being firebombed (and Robert Caryle-zombie avoids inceneration by ducking in an alleyway, whatever I don't care anymore).So Jermey Renner's token black friend lands in his helicoptor and says he's only taking his friend, not anyone else or else he'll get shot down. A bunch of infected show up that survived the fireblast and are coming towards the survivors (I wonder if the big loud helicoptor had anything to do with it) and in true action stupidity token uses his helicoptor propellers to slice up the horde, spraying blood all over his helicoptor. Yeah carrying a few kids on your helicoptor will get you shot down but infected blood painted all over your helicoptor won't. Again, the helicoptor couldn't carry the kids until one of them was infected, for sequel purposes defy consistency and logic. (P.S. interesting how Planet Terror and 28 Weeks Later came out in the same month and had the same stunt, anyone know which came up with the idea?)So the helicoptor leaves them and they're running away from even MORE remaining infected that survived firebombing and helicoptor slicing, and they run into the city, which is now being gassed (for all the military's thorough efforts, Robert Caryle-zombie can survive them all). So the survivors minus Jeremy Renner are driving through desolate London when an attack helicoptor comes, sees a car driving, and starts blasting at it with miniguns. Not only are they taking 'Code Red' to laughable extremes, but how do those fools in the helicoptor miss a lone vechicle, it's like shooting at that car for about a minute or two and can't hit the damn thing.So the car goes into the subway and there's only 1 zombie alive, of course it's Robert Caryle, for DRAMA! So he offs Rose Byrne in a shot that Quarantine later ripped off without shame then bites Muggleton Poots or something until Imogen Toots through tears shoots him off with loud soap-opera music blaring to remind you that this is really a family drama. So now Poots (or was it Toots?) is dormantly infected, and so NOW the helicoptor pilot will take them up, and there's no apparent sign that token black pilot will get shot down. Hm.So 28 Weeks Later was entertaining and had high ambitions, the acting was good and the whole story was pretty interesting, it just had so many plot holes glaring me in the face that I couldn't come to enjoy it as much as 28 Days Later. Sure Days had some plot holes too, but they were fewer and far between and were more ambigious instead of just plain vanilla stupid like the holes in Weeks. So some great scenes that are few and far inbetween don't make up for an overall jarring and bumpy experience of a movie. If you must watch this open a few beers first so you don't have to think very much about all the dumb crap this movie tries to get away with.",3,28 Plot Holes Later,1339977600,"06 18,

1090870,A3TY1C8ZHY5THP,B000TJBN7Q,"Inept Editor ""TheIneptOwl.com""","[3, 4]","28 Weeks Later combines melancholy music, dark cinematography and camera shots that alternate between long fluid movements and careening hand held footage in order to draw the audience into disturbingly graphic scenes. In the sequel, the audience is taken on an action packed journey with the Harris family as they attempt to escape the disease that affected millions of individuals across Great Britain in the original modern day zombie film.The film is launched with a heart pounding chase scene that leaves Don Harris as the sole survivor among a group who has taken refuge at a small farm in rural England. Coincidentally, it is Don and his wife who open the door to the rebirth of the zombie disease, which sends their very own children on a journey to escape the condemned country. The movie climaxes with an escape scene shot nearly entirely in night vision. Although fans will adore the grainy quality of the movie, which filmmakers carried over from the original, and the fast paced story, there are a few problems with the sequel.Story line was not this film's strong point. The audience can see that a good idea was in place, but not carried through to the screen with complete clarity. Supporting characters enter and exit scenes in such a dominating fashion that the audience has trouble identifying the main character of the film. Also, the main point of the film is a mutation of the original virus. A nice idea, yet with the mutation the filmmakers added several discrepancies in character, which are not thoroughly explained by the mutation explanation. In other words the zombies do not obey as the audience expects.In addition, many scenes were built around jarring hand held footage that is designed to disorient the audience, yet at times the footage becomes so jumbled that it is difficult to identify the character actions. In some instances the bouncing shots are so obtuse that the footage becomes nearly monotonous.Coming from a fan who thought the original film was one of the most innovative horror movies of modern filmmaking, 28 Weeks Later is an entertaining ride that I suggest movie goers choose to experience from a comfortable recliner at home.",3,Maintain The Quarantine,1263427200,"01 14, 2010",2010,2179,"['28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'combines', 'melancholy', 'music', 'dark', 'cinematography', 'camera', 'shots', 'alternate', 'long', 'fluid', 'movements', 'careening', 'hand', 'held', 'footage', 'order', 'draw', 'audience', 'disturbingly', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'sequel', 'audience', 'taken', 'action', 'packed', 'journey', 'Harris', 'family', 'attempt', 'escape', 'disease', 'affected', 'millions', 'individuals', 'Great', 'Britain', 'original', 'modern', 'day', 'zombie', 'film.The', 'film', 'launched', 'heart', 'pounding', 'chase', 'scene', 'Don', 'Harris', 'sole', 'survivor', 'group', 'who', 'taken', 'refuge', 'small', 'farm', 'rural', 'England', 'Coincidentally', 'Don', 'wife', 'who', 'open', 'door', 'rebirth', 'zombie', 'disease', 'very', 'own', 'children', 'journey', 'escape', 'condemned', 'country', 'movie', 'climaxes', 'escape', 'scene', 'shot', 'nearly', 'entirely', 'night', 'vision', 'fans', 'will', 'adore', 'grainy', 'quality', 'movie', 'filmmakers', 'carried', 'original', 'fast', 'paced', 'story', 'are', 'few', 'problems', 'sequel.Story', 'line', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'strong', 'point', 'audience', 'can', 'see', 'good', 'idea', 'was', 'place', 'not', 'carried', 'screen', 'complete', 'clarity', 'Supporting', 'characters', 'enter', 'exit', 'scenes', 'such', 'dominating', 'fashion', 'audience', 'trouble', 'identifying', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'Also', 'main', 'point', 'film', 'mutation', 'original', 'virus', 'nice', 'idea', 'yet', 'mutation', 'filmmakers', 'added', 'several', 'discrepancies', 'character', 'are', 'not', 'thoroughly', 'explained', 'mutation', 'explanation', 'other', 'words', 'zombies', 'do', 'not', 'obey', 'audience', 'expects.In', 'addition', 'many', 'scenes', 'were', 'built', 'jarring', 'hand', 'held', 'footage', 'designed', 'disorient', 'audience', 'yet', 'times', 'footage', 'so', 'jumbled', 'difficult', 'identify', 'character', 'actions', 'instances', 'bouncing', 'shots', 'are', 'so', 'footage', 'nearly', 'monotonous.Coming', 'fan', 'who', 'thought', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'innovative', 'horror', 'movies', 'modern', 'filmmaking', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'entertaining', 'ride', 'suggest', 'movie', 'goers', 'choose', 'experience', 'comfortable', 'recliner', 'home']",28 Weeks Later

It doesn't disappoint.The filme begins with a great scene which is assumed to have happened at the same time as the original movie. We find Don, Alice, and several others attempting to squeak by in life, scrounging on what they can, hiding in a dank, dark basement of an inner-city cottage of sorts. The windows and doors are boarded up; no light gets in. They don't want those infected by the Rage virus to realize that ""normal"" people are inside.Unfortunately, however, they are discovered, and their quiet, safe cottage soon becomes a source of carnage and chaos. Don is forced into self-preservation mode when an infected person is placed between him and his wife. What makes the decision especially difficult is that Don is right next to an escape route. An exciting start gets even more interesting when Don decides to abandon his wife and make a break for it.As he makes his way out of the cottage, he looks back to find his wife screaming for him, and looking at him through a window. The anguish is written all over his face as his wife is taken down by the infected, but he continues to make his escape, running as fast as he can. Naturally, he begins to get chanced by the infected, and a great fear of someone being chased is realized: open fields with no escape route are not the preferred location.After Don's escape, where he has to yet again make a decision to leave someone behind and display the truism in today's cynicism, the movie ties up the loose ends of the original. The British Isles, just as Jim and that soldier who was chained up along with him suspected, have been quarantined, and the Rage-infected people are left to die of starvation. Well, 28 weeks later, the world decides that the outbreak has contained itself, and the time has come to rebuild society on the British Isles.The cleanup effort contains all you would expect: a large military presence, burning of bodies, reconstruction, creation of order, and repopulation. The U.S. Army and its NATO allies hold strict control over the logistics and the mission. It's still not safe, and only an isolated area of the island where the majority of the cleanup has occurred will be inhabited. Most of the repopulation is comprised of those who were off the island at the time of the original outbreak, or at least those who made it off.Don is placed in this location as a manager of a building of sorts, and his children are part of the repopulation process. We're shown the happy reunion and we find out that the children were in Spain when the Rage outbreak began. It's only a matter of time before his children, Tammy and Andy, ask about their mother, and Don, naturally, lies to them, telling them he tried to help her but the Rage-infected people got her. He sells it really well, though, and they believe him.Unfortunately for Don, the movie had to progress, and the Rage had to reappear; otherwise, there wouldn't be a movie. So, naturally, Don's children escape the quarantined zone to travel back home. There are some items they want to get, specifically a picture of their mother, so that she is never forgotten. It turns out that their mother isn't dead, and Don, as well as involved scientists, have some 'splaining to do!It turns out that the mother has the Rage virus, but is somehow immune. This tidbit of information should have been passed to Don, because he clearly wants to make amends, explain himself, and be ""close"" to his wife. And, thus, the outbreak begins anew.From there, disorder and confusion ensue, with the military unsure how to handle the rapid spread of the virus, especially when fueled by a frantic, scared, panic-stricken population. The military is forced to go into a ""Code Red"" situation, and that is almost always a bad thing for the bad guys. ""Code Red"" in this movie means using a sledge-hammer to kill a fly, and the military does a pretty good job of killing the fly. It's just too bad that it's not 100% effective.As a result of the slight military inadequacies, we find a cast of survivors, which include the children and their doctor, as well as one of the Army snipers, running to the safety of a helicopter extrication at Wembley Stadium.The film ends on a somber, downtrodden nature, as we see the helicopter, which has presumably crashed, in Paris, France, and the Rage virus has spread off the British Isles.It's a worthy sequel, with much of what made the original such a cult classic. The only real negative that I can mention is that there are parts of the movie, in the director's effort to convey the incredibly frenetic post-outbreak chaos, that have very shaky, unstable, even distracting filmwork. It's as if the filming was done during an earthquake and there is absolutely no stability. Otherwise, the style, theme, sound, feel, and if possible, even the smell makes the viewer think of the original, and in that effort to be true to the original, this film is a resounding success.",5,Great horror sequel -

As such I thoroughly enjoyed the low-budget, high concept endeavor that was ""28 Days Later"".  Was it a perfect film?  Not by any means.  I'll grant that it drags a bit at the start and fizzles a bit toward the end.  But what is sandwiched in between is pure joy.When I heard a sequel was being released I was not at all surprised.  But like most fans of the first film, I wasn't expecting much.  Sequel films of any genre tend to disappoint more often than not, let alone horror sequels.  But damned if I wasn't going to watch ""28 Weeks Later"" anyway.  Boy was I surprised.Despite a totally new cast and different director (spanish speaking at that), ""28 Weeks Later"" manages to dial up the intensity with a clever and plausible view into the not too distant future.  The movie picks up of course, 28 weeks after the first outbreak of the rage virus.  This time the story focuses on the clean-up and reintegration of citizens back in to London to start over.But the writer/s were clever in their approach.  While the film still has large scale scope, the story focuses mainly on one family and allows us to really emotionally connect to them, rather than just sit and wait for them to become zombie food.  In addition we discover that this family will play a critical role in the fate of the world versus the rage virus.So why is the sequel better?  No secrets here.  The characters and story are simply better written, acted and executed.  Further, the film clocks in at a very tight 1 hour and 32 minutes.  But worry not, there's still plenty of gore to go around.  I would have to say though, that the best aspect of the sequel is the cinematography.  It's exquisite...and I don't mean for a horror flick.  I mean for any type of film period.  Inventive and clever shots abound in this film which keeps perspective fresh and always engaging.I can't envision anyone who loved the first film not loving this sequel even more.  ""28 Weeks Later"" accomplishes what has proven nearly impossible in film making.  It not only maintains the continuity and feel of the first film, but also manages to carve out it's own identity rather than just regurgitate the first film in a different wrapper.  No small feat these days.

But it's surprisingly interesting. Maintaining the naturalistic visual style of the original, this one takes on new characters, and deals with the aftermath of the first. It effectively builds a sense of dread, and leverages the realities of epidemic disease to push the characters to difficult choices that feel real. The violence is considerable, but it isn't gratuitous, at least until the last act where the film admittedly goes off the rails a bit. It does, however, end appropriately.There are quite a few surprises in here, and the cast is strong, some of them having gone on to bigger stardom.

1090881,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000TJBN7Q,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[3, 6]","Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later (2002), I thought, had all the positive and negative traits of a typical Boyle film. The film had its moments of effective film making. The concept of ""28 Days Later,"" however, is golden. Like George Romero's zombie flicks, the storyline of an incurable virus turning those infected into ravenous zombie-like murderers that is quarantined within the main British isle, is so ripe for possible sequels and spin-offs. As expected, a sequel is made --- grossly entitled ""28 Weeks Later"" (a sequel would probably be entitled 28 months or years later). It's not directed by Boyle but by director Juan Carlos Fresnadilla.You spot the differences immediately between these two directors. The film opens with Robert Carlyle and Catherine McCormack holed up in a cottage out in the British countryside. They're preparing a meal and discussing the fate of their kids as they traveled away for vacation just before the outbreak. Their dinner is interrupted by a young boy that has fled from a pack of infected that included his parents trying to kill him. This line of dialogue sets up the film's main theme: reconnection. It's not as eye-catching as Boyle's opening where he had then-newcomer Cillian Murphy alone inside a hospital room, and the moment he steps out of the hospital, an eerily empty London embraces his newly-recovered senses. Fresnadillo clearly doesn't want to dillydally and doesn't see the value of establishment. He throws us the facts right away, clearly banking on his audience's familiarity with Boyle's original work, and takes us straight to the action. A few minutes later, the survivors are in distress.If Fresnadillo's concern is to create a film that is more visceral, more gruesome, more violent than its predecessor, he certainly achieved it. However, I think Fresnadillo belongs to that school of filmmaking wherein cameras are supposed to be in a state of perpetual motion, and a shot should not last more than 2 seconds. The film is edited erratically, and the camera movements are unbearably jerky, that it's almost impossible to tell who's biting who, who's escaping from whom, and so on which was plain torture.It's quite unfortunate that the film suffers from a tired aesthetic style (I would've preferred Boyle who despite his MTV-tendencies still knows when to stop and just enjoy that moment of serenity). The story actually has good moments. Sure, there are certain instances wherein the characters start losing a hold on common sense or logic, but as a sequel to a film that draws its powers from a ridiculous idea to begin with, the writers didn't do that bad. London 28 weeks later looks like a more affluent Baghdad --- surrounded by Americans who are armed and have their own protocols. ""28 Weeks Later"" exploits that idea slightly through out this film. The themes do not have the philosophical underpinnings or the sophistication of Romero's zombie parables. The allusions are quite plainly mere metaphors that manage to distract me from the film's want of visual quality.

I really liked the original because it created a different kind of ""zombie""--one that had superhuman strength, speed, and anger.  Under those conditions, its easy to see how things can quickly spin out of control.  The horror bonifides of the film (suspense, action, and gore) are all first rate, the acting is good, and the scenario (London being repopulated under military supervision) is definitely plausible.  However, the devil is in the details.  While the story flows well, there are some things that need clearing up:1.  How is it possible for the military to create an airtight civilian Safe room, but still neglect to secure the back door?  Of all the logical hiccups in the movie, the ease with which the all-important Safe room was penetrated simply had me shaking my head in disbelief.2.  Picking on the Safe room again, did anyone with half a brain consider how fast the virus could spread in such a densely packed area?  Didn't strke me as too ""Safe"".  Individual safe ""cells"" would have been much better.3.  A close second was that the Father (who was not a doctor, but a building caretaker) was allowed access to medical quarantine areas.  Also, why wasn't the Mother guarded 24/7 after just being brought back?4.  Why don't the infected ever attack each other?  They appear to have no intelligence (not even smart enough to eat), but are somehow able to distinguish normal from infected targets.  Perhaps the virus was specifically designed to have that effect, but its never explained.5.  How is it the infected retain all that energy if they ingest no food and constantly vomit out all that blood?6.  Lastly, why was there no backup plan that involved putting the fleeing survivors under quarantine themselves?  Or (more directly) even shooting down anything coming from the UK in an emergency.Yeah, yeah, I know--its just a movie.

We see that when it comes to 28 Weeks Later, the sequel to the stylishly original 28 Days Later. It's a solid effot and packed with entertainment, but falls short in terms of the longevity category. When I think longevity, I think of films that stand alone. This is not one of those films.The concept is nice. As viewers, we visit London 28 weeks after the outbreak and roughly two months after the last incident of infection. The US military is in the process of bringing civilization back to London, as they've sealed off a protected area in the heart of London that has everything from running water to electricity. On nearly every rooftop there is a sniper, prepared for the worse. It seems that the powers that be have thought of everything and are ready for any situation. That's until, of course, SHE shows up.""She"" is a mother played by the always-gorgeous Catherine McCormack. She is seemingly infected, but at the same time immune. In other words, she doesn't show signs of the disease - like rage - but if, say, someone like her husband were to kiss her, he would become infected and all hell might break lose. And guess what happens?It's 10 minutes into such a catastrophic levy being openened that I found myself being extremely entertained. I cannot, however, say that the last half-hour of the film was satisfying. As a viewer, I wanted the film to go in certain directions and found that in almost each case (except for a brilliantly executed final 5 minutes of the film), the director had other ideas.This is not your father's 28 Days Later.

The first ten minutes alone were scarier and more action packed than 28 days in and of themselves (and let's not forget that in those opening 10 minutes we see more infected than we see in the entire first movie).Set 28 weeks (duh) after the original infection the US army has declared England free of infection and has begun moving British refugees back into the deserted wasteland that once was the British Isles. A kid named Andy and his older sister are the first children to arrive back in England and are happily reunited with their dad who managed to survive the original outbreak by being a really big wimp (really, you will hate this guy). the army has managed to set up a safe zone, where civies can live (almost) normal lives while, while at the same time continue to clean up the thousands of dead bodies lying all over the place in London (by the way, where did all these bodies come from when in 28 days latter we didn't see any in the streets at all?).Anyway, after about thirty minutes of gawking at all the dead bodies and military build up, we finally get introduced to the infected. A woman is found that carries the rage virus but doesn't suffer from its symptoms. Hurray, now they can finally find a cure for the virus. But... of course the virus manages to break out, call it bad security and horrible luck, but it does. At this point the movie really starts getting good, with tons of gore (oh my god, there wasn't anywhere near this much gore in the first movie), action, and scare your pants off moments. The infection spread like wild fire, and this time WE GET TO SEE IT. Remember in 28 days when that one guy that gets chopped up by the black girl explains how he was in a crowd when the infection spread and that the only way to get out was to go up? Remember? Well that scene is played out in this movie and boy is it creepy. Its great to see how one infected person, just one, can infect hundreds, no, thousands of people. It spreads so fast that in a matter of hours the military is forced to fire bomb the city and use chemical weapons to stop its spread.If you like zombie movies than you will love this one. It beats Romero by a mile (blasphemy I know, but just see the movie) and puts to shame everything else. Finally I got what I wanted to see, a zombie infection as it spread. No other zombie movie I can think of showed the spread of the plague anywhere NEAR as good as this one did. One minute everything is all hunky dory and the next BOOM, everyone's dead, and all because of one person. Wow.So if you like action, see this movie. If you like gore, see this movie. If you don't get embarrassed when others hear you gasp in horror, see this movie (and if you do, just see if by yourself). This is the zombie movie of the century, beating out the Dawn of the Dead remake, Romero's Land of the Dead, and the first 28 movie. I would even go so far as to say it's the best zombie movie ever, period. so if you like zombies, and I'm sure you do if your reading this review, than drop whatever it is your doing and go see 28 weeks latter now.

1090894,A2Y3CWITEF9JGY,B000TJBN7Q,"JP Salazar ""Web Developer""","[3, 6]","I found myself watching another apocalyptic movie this weekend. 28 Weeks Later is the sequel of the 2002 zombie British hit 28 Days Later. The story is somehow, weaker this time around, but it gives us decent amounts of suspense, and the visuals are much better that its predecessor. It's the zombie flick for the 21st Century.Brief Introduction Story:A group of survivors led by Don (Robert Carlyle) are hiding in a farm house in the countryside, away from the city and its ""infected"" inhabitants. A child knocks on the door and they let him in, he seems to be ok. All of the sudden, the zombies find the house and start attacking everybody. Don gets to kill some of them, but he is unable to save his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack). As she is crying for help, he leaves her--basically she is left for dead. He runs away and barely escapes from the blood-thirsty zombies.Six months after the virus stroke humanity, Great Britain is now under the US protection. The US military is now in charge of security. Now that all the infected people have died--apparently--some geniuses decide to bring the population back to a small ""safe zone"" in London. Don and his two kids reunite at last. He explains to his kids--his way--what happened to their mother.The kids are bored in this self-contained area and decide to go out. They leave the safe zone and go to a restricted area of London--an empty city, a reminder of the terrible things that happened there. They find their house, indeed, but they also find their mother hiding in the house--apparently, she survived the attack. Suddenly US soldiers get to the house and secure the area.Alice is now in the military base for testing, and unfortunately she is positive. But the unusual thing is that she does not show any signs of the disease. Is there a hope for humankind? What's so special about her? Bringing her to the safe zone is not a good idea anyways.Review:28 Weeks Later relies on flashy camera work to give us a futuristic vision of tension, uncertainty and desolation. The aerial shots of London look impressive similar to a war zone with empty streets and wrecked cars. In other words, the photography is probably the best attribute the film has--very realistic, similar to Children of Men. Although the soundtrack was intrusive at times, visuals get a B+.The story is somehow, sillier than the previous film which was about surviving. This time around, it's more about family values--and dealing with guilt. This family affair sub-plot just didn't work for me. It gives the movie a melodramatic touch that wasn't necessary and because of this, the movie drags for a while. People come to watch these movies for zombie action and I believe the movie needed a bit more of that.As I watched the film, many questions were wondering my mind. Why would you want to bring people back so soon? Scientists barely know the disease and don't even have the cure. Not only that, they were never sure if the virus was dead. Maybe the Brits were so eager to comeback and start over, but that's not fully explained. Also, the movie doesn't show if the entire country is secured--London is the only place we know.The Verdict:Zombie films are getting more ""scientifically"" correct nowadays. Where is all the fun? Give us less drama and more action next time. Visually pretty, but 28 Weeks Later drags and has mildness horror moments.",3,The Zombie Flick For The 21st Century,1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,3377,"['found', 'watching', 'apocalyptic', 'movie', 'weekend', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'sequel', '2002', 'zombie', 'British', 'hit', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'story', 'somehow', 'weaker', 'time', 'around', 'decent', 'amounts', 'suspense', 'visuals', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'predecessor', 'zombie', 'flick', '21st', 'Century.Brief', 'Introduction', 'Story', 'group', 'survivors', 'led', 'Don', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'are', 'hiding', 'farm', 'house', 'countryside', 'away', 'city', 'infected', 'inhabitants', 'child', 'door', 'let', 'be', 'ok.', 'sudden', 'zombies', 'find', 'house', 'start', 'attacking', 'everybody', 'Don', 'kill', 'unable', 'save', 'wife', 'Alice', 'Catherine', 'McCormack', 'crying', 'help', 'basically', 'left', 'dead', 'away', 'barely', 'escapes', 'blood-thirsty', 'zombies.Six', 'months', 'virus', 'stroke', 'humanity', 'Great', 'Britain', 'now', 'US', 'protection', 'US', 'military', 'now', 'charge', 'security', 'Now', 'infected', 'people', 'have', 'died', 'apparently', 'geniuses', 'decide', 'bring', 'population', 'back', 'small', 'safe', 'zone', 'London', 'Don', 'two', 'kids', 'reunite', 'last', 'kids', 'way', 'what', 'happened', 'mother.The', 'kids', 'are', 'bored', 'self-contained', 'area', 'decide', 'go', 'out', 'leave', 'safe', 'zone', 'go', 'restricted', 'area', 'London', 'empty', 'city', 'reminder', 'terrible', 'things', 'happened', 'there', 'find', 'house', 'indeed', 'also', 'find', 'mother', 'hiding', 'house', 'apparently', 'survived', 'attack', 'Suddenly', 'US', 'soldiers', 'get', 'house', 'secure', 'area.Alice', 'now', 'military', 'base', 'testing', 'unfortunately', 'positive', 'unusual', 'thing', 'not', 'show', 'signs', 'disease', 'hope', 'humankind', 'What', 'so', 'special', 'Bringing', 'safe', 'zone', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'anyways.Review:28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'relies', 'flashy', 'camera', 'work', 'give', 'futuristic', 'vision', 'tension', 'uncertainty', 'desolation', 'aerial', 'shots', 'London', 'look', 'impressive', 'similar', 'war', 'zone', 'empty', 'streets', 'wrecked', 'cars', 'other', 'words', 'photography', 'probably', 'best', 'attribute', 'film', 'very', 'realistic', 'similar', 'Children', 'Men', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'intrusive', 'times', 'visuals', 'get', 'B+.The', 'story', 'somehow', 'sillier', 'previous', 'film', 'was', 'surviving', 'time', 'around', 'more', 'family', 'values', 'dealing', 'guilt', 'family', 'sub-plot', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'movie', 'melodramatic', 'touch', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'movie', 'while', 'People', 'come', 'watch', 'movies', 'zombie', 'action', 'believe', 'movie', 'needed', 'bit', 'more', 'that.As', 'watched', 'film', 'many', 'questions', 'were', 'wondering', 'mind', 'Why', 'would', 'want', 'bring', 'people', 'back', 'so', 'soon', 'Scientists', 'barely', 'know', 'disease', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'cure', 'Not', 'only', 'were', 'never', 'sure', 'virus', 'was', 'dead', 'Maybe', 'Brits', 'were', 'so', 'eager', 'comeback', 'start', 'not', 'fully', 'explained', 'Also', 'movie', ""n't"", 'show', 'entire', 'country', 'secured', 'London', 'only', 'place', 'know.The', 'Verdict', 'Zombie', 'films', 'are', 'getting', 'more', 'scientifically', 'correct', 'nowadays', 'Where', 'fun', 'Give', 'less', 'drama', 'more', 'action', 'next', 'time', 'Visually', 'pretty', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'drags', 'mildness', 'horror', 'moments']",28 Weeks Later

1090896,AIIR8E34EDKCQ,B000TJBN7Q,- Kasia S.,"[21, 25]","There's always that extra obstacle to conquer when making sequels, for the lovers of the first movie the second needs a reason to exist, it has to be real, strong and carry the story further than one could have imagined. I really enjoyed ""28 Days Later"" because I got to see it in a half empty theater with a friend, and it felt so real and brutal that I walked out with my knees shaking. Then I saw this movie at home and while it still made me cringe I don't think that it was the lack of super sized screen that made the movie feel smaller than the first, somehow as good as it was there were flaws to it that made it hard for me to give it more stars.Overall I'm glad I saw it, it was scary, bloody, gross, there was lots of close run ins and plenty of super hungry, super fast infected zombies but the little things that allowed the outbreak spread again made me shake my head in disbelief. At one point I was laughing (the scene in the dark at the stadium escalator) because it was so ridiculous and then I was flabbergasted at the bad decisions, like the new kids who arrived at the cleaned now London sneaked out to get something from their old home even thought it was forbidden to leave, they simply took this dramatic stance against everyone's safety as they opened the portals to hell for everyone else. I was surprised to see who was the main carrier of the virus and then who spread it to everyone else, I know the zombies were fast but the so called safe army guarded compound was like kindergarten during an Easter egg hunt, the infected ravaged anyone they pleased and it seemed that even all those weapons and precautions didn't do much to stop the spread.The movie looked good, I liked the eerie and forlorn mood and it was a good chunk of horror watching on a rainy Sunday but the little bits of stupidity that well, allowed for the sequel to exist were little too much. At the end it left me feeling depressed, so I guess goal accomplished! Not bad but not the greatest although worth the watch for horror fans. I am guessing that if there is another entry it will be called 28 months later, now that would be interesting to see...- Kasia S.",3,Time flies when you're running for your life,1214784000,"06 30, 2008",2008,2162,"['always', 'extra', 'obstacle', 'conquer', 'when', 'making', 'sequels', 'lovers', 'first', 'movie', 'second', 'reason', 'exist', 'be', 'real', 'strong', 'carry', 'story', 'further', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'imagined', 'really', 'enjoyed', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'got', 'see', 'half', 'empty', 'theater', 'friend', 'felt', 'so', 'real', 'brutal', 'walked', 'out', 'knees', 'shaking', 'Then', 'saw', 'movie', 'home', 'still', 'made', 'cringe', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'lack', 'super', 'sized', 'screen', 'made', 'movie', 'feel', 'smaller', 'first', 'somehow', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'were', 'flaws', 'made', 'hard', 'give', 'more', 'stars.Overall', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saw', 'was', 'scary', 'bloody', 'gross', 'was', 'lots', 'close', 'run', 'ins', 'plenty', 'super', 'hungry', 'super', 'fast', 'infected', 'zombies', 'little', 'things', 'allowed', 'outbreak', 'spread', 'again', 'made', 'shake', 'head', 'disbelief', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'laughing', 'scene', 'dark', 'stadium', 'escalator', 'was', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'then', 'was', 'flabbergasted', 'bad', 'decisions', 'new', 'kids', 'who', 'arrived', 'cleaned', 'now', 'London', 'sneaked', 'out', 'get', 'something', 'old', 'home', 'even', 'thought', 'was', 'forbidden', 'leave', 'simply', 'took', 'dramatic', 'stance', 'everyone', 'safety', 'opened', 'portals', 'hell', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'who', 'was', 'main', 'carrier', 'virus', 'then', 'who', 'spread', 'everyone', 'else', 'know', 'zombies', 'were', 'fast', 'so', 'called', 'safe', 'army', 'guarded', 'compound', 'was', 'like', 'kindergarten', 'Easter', 'egg', 'hunt', 'infected', 'ravaged', 'anyone', 'pleased', 'seemed', 'even', 'weapons', 'precautions', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'stop', 'spread.The', 'movie', 'looked', 'good', 'liked', 'eerie', 'forlorn', 'mood', 'was', 'good', 'chunk', 'horror', 'watching', 'rainy', 'Sunday', 'little', 'bits', 'stupidity', 'well', 'allowed', 'sequel', 'exist', 'were', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'end', 'left', 'feeling', 'depressed', 'guess', 'goal', 'accomplished', 'Not', 'bad', 'not', 'greatest', 'worth', 'watch', 'horror', 'fans', 'am', 'guessing', 'entry', 'will', 'be', 'called', '28', 'months', 'later', 'now', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'Kasia', 'S']",28 Weeks Later

Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, who previously helmed ""Intacto,"" has infused ""28 Weeks Later"" with a more ""Hostel""-proper level of gore -- projectile blood vomit erupts at regularly spaced intervals, eyeballs get squished and, in a Peter Jackson-worthy scene, a mob of zombies gets sliced and diced by chopper blades in a celebratory burst of gristle, hemoglobin and bone.There is the obligatory jab at the U.S. empire's reputation for barbarism toward foreigners (i.e., the current war on terror) and, just like ""The Host"" and ""Jurassic Park,"" ""28 Weeks"" criticizes the pitfalls of a technologically murky society. Then there is a misplaced subplot involving a father's cowardliness and subsequent regret that culminates in an awkward scene that begins with forgiveness and ends in blind rage. But primarily, ""28 Days Later"" is about zombie face time. The rest of the film plays second fiddle to these orgies of rotting, human-size, PCP-infused piranha. And Fresnadillo gorges the viewer on zombies until your brain pan's fried. It's not bad, it's just no rival to the flawless ""28 Days Later.""I think it's time for a zombie romance movie.

1090898,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B000TJBN7Q,K. Driscoll,"[6, 7]","28 Weeks Later is a sequel to Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, which was a refreshing zombie film that took itself very seriously and arguably reinvigorated the sub-genre for bloodthirsty audiences around the world...I consider myself among them.  Danny Boyle steps back as director but his influence is intact as he produces this film.  Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, a Spanish filmmaker recently nominated for an Academy Award for his short film Esposados (released in the US as Linked), directs this sequel but maintains many of the stylistic standards of the first film.  Like 28 Days Later the cinematography is digital, and it is in 35mm format with some shaky camera work and some very quick edits.  I have to admit that at times the attack scenes seemed a little over-stylized and one scene was derivative enough from the Blair Witch Project that it came off as an intentional tribute.  Not to say that bothers me much, I'm just pointing it out.The first film was about a virus called ""Rage"" that quickly turns it's victims into fast-moving cannibals that are a bit more real and scary than the mindless traditional zombies of George Romero's films.  After a while the first film ended with all the infected people starving to death. The second film starts off with a thorough American occupation of London that works to contain and prevent another outbreak while at the same time re-introducing British civilians.  We are then introduced to a family of characters, some of which have a genetic abnormality that allows them to remain healthy with the virus.  They are un-effected carriers of ""Rage"".  This of course leads to another outbreak in the setting of a military occupied London.  And so we sit back and watch as the zombified shenanigans ensue.28 Weeks Later is extremely violent but it's even more brutal than many films of this sub-genre because it takes itself so seriously and it actually works effectively for that.  We are introduced to several would-be protagonists, two of which are deeply riddled with guilt and that makes the characters three-dimensional which allows us to actually care about them.  But by the same token, the movie doesn't pull punches and the zombies get their way more often than not.  That means the violent tone in general was a bit more real for me.  There is also an incredibly gory sequence that is identical to a scene in Planet Terror, the first feature in the recent collaboration Grindhouse.  It's interesting to compare the two scenes, because in Planet Terror the scene is so amusing and slapsticky while essentially the same scene here in 28 Weeks Later comes off as shocking and disgusting. It is an interesting comparison that compliments the refined style of both movies.The middle acts of 28 Weeks Later serve as a political allegory of sorts, in terms of the war in Iraq, although I couldn't perceive which side the film is actually taking.  It seemed to suggest both judgements of ineptitude and sympathy toward the American military.  So the commentary seemed kind of inconsequential other than to reflect our modern cultural and political climate, which is firmly in the tradition of George Romero's early zombie movies, Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead.

However, within days, Alice is discovered alive and brought back to London.  It is discovered that she has immunity to the Rage Virus.Don, feeling guilty, goes to see his wife at the military clinic.  He pleads with his wife to forgive him.  He kisses her and instantly becomes infected with the virus.  Then...all hell breaks loose.Meanwhile, the military must protect these 2 children as they may possibly carry the immunity just like their mother.

I like it even better after watching it again. The message here is a lot more insidious than the message of the first movie. It's harder to grasp, at first, but once you see it and start thinking about it, it just keeps finding its way back to the front of your head.This movie is, from beginning to end, a heartbreaking treatise on how a father's failings destroy, first, his own family and then, as a consequence, his entire society. That's a powerful and (I think) controversial thought to put out there, but the movie handles it delicately and responsibly, weaving the father's flaws and best intentions into the most human zombie since Bub.Robert Carlyle executes this role with subtlety and grace: his character's love for and abandonment of his wife, the lie he tells his children, the pain in his face even when he is completely out of control - all of these emotions are evident on his bloodstained face. Catherine McCormack is amazing in a far-too-small role as the wronged wife and mother whose compassionate choice leads to her death - more than once.Yes, the dialogue is terse, and, yes, the plot is spare, but this is a poetic depiction of how a family disintegrates and takes down everything around it - and how society's efforts to change that - public housing, incarceration, state-sanctioned violence, and finally catastrophic military intervention - ultimately fail.I guess it probably goes without saying that zombie movies are pretty misanthropic as a general rule, and 28 Weeks Later is no exception, but unlike most other movies in the genre, this one is balanced with a fairly sympathetic take on nearly all of the humans involved - not just a few heroic ones. Almost all of these characters are doing their best.

1090913,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B000TJBN7Q,"Maine Writer ""David""","[4, 28]","Calling 28 Weeks Later a story is, frankly, stretching things.  Think of it more as a sequence of scenes, some frenetically frightening and deeply disturbing, some marginally gross in a puerile way, others genuinely boring -- as characters trudge from point to point in search of a ride on an Apache helicopter.Of the characters, only one is sufficiently unique or engaging to grab the audience, and she, the mother of the family at the center of the film, dies early.  The most interesting stab at character and plot development -- a father's lie to his children about the fate of their mother -- seems full of promise, but ends shortly after take off with a crashing, blood-soaked, and, finally, charred finish. Rather than employing the time-honored idea of a character arc (in which, perhaps, the father ultimately redeems himself through some act of heroism), the father becomes this incredibly controlled killing machine (unlike all of the other infected), which then leads to random, semi-plausible people being chased from one place to the next and dying here and there, all the while haunted a foreshadowed ending that, early in Act I, hits you between the eyes (literally) like a two-by-four.Let me be very clear, however. 28 Weeks Later has some incredibly scary moments that will stick with you, courtesy of some terrific cinematography and post-production. The ""zombies"" in the film seem real, ravenous, and frightening. The opening sequences of the film are terrific for all of these reasons. And, if that's what floats your boat, and you don't really need much more, you'll likely enjoy this film.

Do we care about them and their journey? This sorry sequel offers the wrong answers. You will not care about the characters in this film, so what happens to them is of no consequence whatsoever. Think back to what you truly enjoyed about 28 Days Later. An artificial family unit coalesces, comprised of distinct, well-drawn characters who come to care about each other. We get to see their perils, and the lengths to which they will go to help each other. Unexpectedly, the 28 Days soundtrack is dreamily serene, accompanying visuals which are artful and expansive. In this context, the violence, when it comes, seems even more uncomfortably close and visceral. And since we care about the characters in the first film, the violence is even more real and terrifying. In fact, every violent scene in the original film has purpose, pushing its plot and characters forward. This sloppy, nihilistic sequel offers few moments of calm or contrast, little purpose or poetry, and no imagination, but instead a great deal of splatter and noise.

Even with its MANY faults, I can't help but really like this movie.28 Weeks Later starts off during the beginning of the outbreak. Six survivors are hiding out in a cottage, just trying to get by when all hell breaks lose. Honestly it's one of the most intense and amazing intros to a movie I've seen in awhile. There is one scene I can't get out of my head from 28 Days and that's the tunnel scene. One of the best scenes that I always remember from 28 Weeks is what I call the hill scene. When one of the survivors is high tailing it across a field and you see a mass of infected coming over a hill and flocking right to him. Man I love the intro. 28 weeks after the outbreak begins, and the infected have perished from starvation, the military begins to clean up Britain and try to repopulate it. They bring in people from outside (England was quarantined so everyone else was ok) to start their new lives here. A survivor is found later that's infected, but not like `the infected' were. And so begins our cute tale of horror.As for movie itself, I really do like it, but like I said before there are so many faults with it. And it's mainly to make the movie scary or intense I guess. I'll give you an example. When the outbreak begins again (you know it's coming so I am not ruining anything), the military shoves everyone into one big room and then shuts the power off in the city and then turns on the emergency back up lights. Seriously? Why would you do this? That's the kind of thing this movie does a lot, just to add effect to it. It can get pretty eye-rolling for sure. But at the same time, I still can't help but enjoy the movie due to the fun it brings. Like the helicopter scene for instance. Once you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about. So cool.In the end I would say give it a rent unless you just really like the series like me. I own it and love it but I'm still giving it 3 stars cause of the absurd things that happen.P.S. - Hope that 28 Months Later comes out like planned (supposedly 2011).",3,"I could think of 28 reasons why this movie is bad, but I still love it",1235260800,"02 22, 2009",2009,2081,"['love', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'continuation', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'Even', 'MANY', 'faults', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'really', 'movie.28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'beginning', 'outbreak', 'Six', 'survivors', 'are', 'hiding', 'out', 'cottage', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'when', 'hell', 'breaks', 'lose', 'Honestly', 'one', 'most', 'intense', 'amazing', 'intros', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'awhile', 'one', 'scene', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'head', '28', 'Days', 'tunnel', 'scene', 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'always', 'remember', '28', 'Weeks', 'what', 'call', 'hill', 'scene', 'When', 'one', 'survivors', 'high', 'tailing', 'field', 'see', 'mass', 'infected', 'coming', 'hill', 'flocking', 'right', 'Man', 'love', 'intro', '28', 'weeks', 'outbreak', 'infected', 'have', 'perished', 'starvation', 'military', 'begins', 'clean', 'up', 'Britain', 'try', 'repopulate', 'bring', 'people', 'outside', 'England', 'was', 'quarantined', 'so', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'ok', 'start', 'new', 'lives', 'here', 'survivor', 'found', 'later', 'infected', 'not', 'infected', 'were', 'so', 'cute', 'tale', 'horror.As', 'movie', 'really', 'do', 'said', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'faults', 'mainly', 'make', 'movie', 'scary', 'intense', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'give', 'example', 'When', 'outbreak', 'again', 'know', 'coming', 'so', 'am', 'not', 'ruining', 'anything', 'military', 'shoves', 'everyone', 'one', 'big', 'room', 'then', 'power', 'city', 'then', 'emergency', 'back', 'up', 'lights', 'Seriously', 'Why', 'would', 'do', 'kind', 'thing', 'movie', 'lot', 'just', 'add', 'effect', 'can', 'get', 'pretty', 'eye-rolling', 'sure', 'same', 'time', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'due', 'fun', 'helicopter', 'scene', 'instance', 'Once', 'see', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'cool.In', 'end', 'would', 'say', 'give', 'rent', 'just', 'really', 'series', 'own', 'love', ""'m"", 'still', 'giving', '3', 'stars', 'cause', 'absurd', 'things', 'happen.P.S', 'Hope', '28', 'Months', 'Later', 'out', 'planned', 'supposedly', '2011']",28 Weeks Later
1090919,A3DH53FPYSP9E,B000TJBN7Q,Media Man,"[2, 2]","The opening scene of this film immediately drew me in.  I found the scene in which Robert Carlyle decides to abandon his wife to save his own life utterly gut wrenching to watch.  I watch a lot of horror movies and am not easily shocked but for some reason a few scenes in the film really hit me.  I kept thinking of ""what if"" scenarios and how would I react in this situation.  Would I be humane or do what it takes to save myself just to survive.  The only reason this film didn't receive 5 stars from me is not because it wasn't a worth sucessor to the original but because of all of the little unbelievable details that seemed to happen throughout the movie.Pros+ Brutal opening and a few other tough scenes to watch, usually when the ""rage"" infected are attacking their victims.+ Very few slow moments and since the infected move just as fast as every one else there's not the typical run, hide and wait for the zombies to get me.+ The atmosphere of the film was very tense and I found myself tensing up several times without realizing it.+ Gore and special effects were noteworthy.Cons- Story was rather transparent and not very believable.  Would they really let a population of 15,000 people settle in a recently infected but purged London?  They mentioned several times all other areas of the city were not safe.- Jerky and grainy camera work.  Whether it was intentional or not it definitely is not for someone who would suffer from motion sickness.- The ease of which the children escaped the military compound and get into the infected part of the city was laughable.- The father (a janitor) who had an all access pass to the entire facility presses a lockdown button to prove a point to his kids without any reprecussions?-  The infected but immune mother (who unbelievably survived) was left unguarded!  She possibly held the cure for the ""rage"" infection in her blood but she's left alone for the husband to find her and become reinfected, destroying the whole compound.- The lone helicopter pilot was allowed to fly unchecked the entire film, even when military jets are firebombing the compound to destroy the infected.- An infected father who even though he was infected by the ""rage"" was able to avoid being killed, firebombed and track his children to a subway station outside of the compound.Despite all of the cons listed above I still really enjoyed the movie for the sheer tension the movie seemed to instill.

I saw it because of all the hype about the film and really, i didn't find it scary that much. So naturally, i was hesitant on seeing the sequel, 28 Weeks Later but after words, i regretted ever saying it.The sequel, i feel, is a vast improvement over the first one. The plot of the film takes place, fittingly, 28 weeks after the first film. By now, all of England has been de-contamined and London has already begun repopulation with the help of the US army. All things seem to be going well but when two kids venture out of the 'safe walls', they inadvertly cause a breach in the defense of London and when night comes, the virus will have begun to spread again.Not only are there some pretty tense moments but there are also some pretty thrilling sequences as well. By far, my favorite scene would have to be the subway sequence, where the film maker uses a very unique film technique that produces a very narrow film view that adds the tension of the whole scene.The film can also be viewed as an allegory to our modern day goverment and how there decisions tend to work in their favor over the general population.A very satisfying sequel and definently a scary movie to watch at night.",5,A nice scare feast,1191888000,"10 9, 2007",2007,1254,"['Okay', 'so', 'here', 'thing', 'i', 'really', 'did', 'not', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'saw', 'hype', 'film', 'really', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'scary', 'much', 'So', 'naturally', 'i', 'was', 'hesitant', 'seeing', 'sequel', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'words', 'i', 'regretted', 'ever', 'saying', 'it.The', 'sequel', 'i', 'feel', 'vast', 'improvement', 'first', 'one', 'plot', 'film', 'place', 'fittingly', '28', 'weeks', 'first', 'film', 'now', 'England', 'been', 'de-contamined', 'London', 'already', 'begun', 'repopulation', 'help', 'US', 'army', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'going', 'well', 'when', 'two', 'kids', 'venture', ""'safe"", 'walls', 'inadvertly', 'cause', 'breach', 'defense', 'London', 'when', 'night', 'virus', 'will', 'have', 'begun', 'spread', 'only', 'are', 'there', 'pretty', 'tense', 'moments', 'are', 'also', 'pretty', 'thrilling', 'sequences', 'as', 'well', 'far', 'favorite', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'subway', 'sequence', 'where', 'film', 'maker', 'very', 'unique', 'film', 'technique', 'very', 'narrow', 'film', 'view', 'tension', 'whole', 'scene.The', 'film', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'viewed', 'allegory', 'modern', 'day', 'goverment', 'how', 'decisions', 'tend', 'work', 'favor', 'general', 'population.A', 'very', 'satisfying', 'sequel', 'definently', 'scary', 'movie', 'watch', 'night']",28 Weeks Later
1090921,A1A4BX7D2OY0D4,B000TJBN7Q,Michael Garcia,"[0, 0]","28 Weeks Later is the sequel to the successful 2003 28 Days Later.  It stars Robert Carlyle, Jeremy Renner, Idris Elba and others.  The unique feature of this film is that it was shot on 16mm, which gives it a great look and is worth a watch to notice how much better(in my take) movies used to look.  Also, this was at a time when Renner and Elba were not quite the stars that they are today.The basic premise is that 28 weeks later (after the outbreak shown in 28 Days Later), London has been completely overrun run the zombies.  The story follows Robert Carlyle surviving with his wife and a few others in a home before being forced out on the run.  Eventually he turns into a zombie and the film follows Jeremy Renner, a group of snipers and a young girl and boy that group up with Renner and a few others.Overall the plot is fairly simple, its a race to get out of the city, but watching the characters make their way through the city, trying to avoid being eaten or turned is done in a fast-paced, smart way that I kept my attention throughout.  You get to see the type of shots and sequences that later became popular in Walking Dead or World War Z.Like I mentioned, the film is shot on 16mm which gives it a great look compared to other movies of this age.  If you're interested in movie-making or the photography of film, check out this movie and Beasts of the Southern Wild.  Both are on 16mm, which gives such a different/realistic look that is totally different then how the movies of today look.  Watch World War Z(shot digitally), then watch this movie and you'll be able to see the difference.There's many closeups(sometimes to accommodate use of 16mm) and fast-cutting parts, but overall the movie is better than average.  While we don't get depth of character or much complexity in the story, the constant suspense keeps you satisfied.",4,Fun zombie flick!!

1090927,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B000TJBN7Q,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[3, 4]","Alright, I'll admit it - ""28 Weeks Later"", Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's sequel to Danny Boyle's breakout horror-hit, is the definite best of its genre, this season - lightyears more artistic, suspenseful, and dramatic than currently-released ""Hostel: Part 2"" and ""Saw IV"". The film, faithful to many of the theatrical antics of its predecessor (""28 Days Later""), continues the haunting evolution of the typical zombie slasher: simultaneously dark & slimy and bright & gritty, it's the film that ""Resident Evil"" never was - a terrifying race between the living and the infected where the paranormal has no place, and the term ""thriller"" is defined. It's one of the better sequels of the year, and even franchise-creator Danny Boyle had no bad things to say about it.That being said, ""28 Weeks"" may easily go down in the hearts of fans as one of the most terrible perversions in the history of film.""28 Weeks"", under the guise of staying legitimate through the continued use of digital photography and erratic camera-motion, blasts you with all the antics of blockbuster cinema and dares you to question its integrity. There is, however, nothing theatrically or dramatically signifigant about the lows that ""Weeks"" resorts to in order to shock its audiences: more blood, grindhouse violence, and the watering-down of characters to the point that they're completely one-dimensional.Everything that was good or visionary about the original film has become a step-by-step process that Juan Fresnadillo follows in hopes of replicating what was unique about the prequel: from the moment that the first lady is infected and spews blood, everything is mechanical and typically B-grade - absolutely nothing about the action, thrills, or suspense is inventive or otherwise not a complete re-hash of other, lesser zombie films.In addition, we have the new list of concepts that've been introduced in an attempt to ""spice up"" the action and drama for a strictly American audience: nightmares of the dead, an increased level of violence and gore seen on-screen (culminating in a scene where an infected Don beats his bound wife, gouges her eyes out, and rips her throat to shreds), and parallels between the film and the (real-life) invasion of Iraq - all tasteless, unimaginative, and contemporary cliches that serve to degrade what might've been a great film had it been left in the hands of the independents. This butchered story - an appetizer for the gorehounds and male teens with delusions of tastefulness - is the face beneath the facade of ""one of the best sequels ever made"": ugly, artificial, and full of antics which it knows nothing to do with (ex.: the ""night vision"" scene, despite showing shades of ""The Silence Of The Lambs"", is nothing more than a seat-edger - tired, melodramatic, and essentially just supplies some extra gore).""28 Weeks Later"" is a blockbuster at best, and at its best, it's tense and suspenseful, exhilarating and exciting. As a matter of fact, it can stay that way if you're not looking for anything deeper than a flesh wound. However, if you're looking for a match to the original's emotional trek, you'll be dissapointed - the film ends before the adventure seems to have begun, but already 15,000 people have been burned up. What's more, the final shot of the Eiffel Tower promises that we'll get more gooey blood and snarling folks come 2009. The question remains, will Danny Boyle return to the director's chair to save his shriveling franchise?

It screwed up the story and made it go downhill fast.That said: This started out so well.The moment where Robert Carlyle's character (and I love this actor, on reason I rented the flick, the other being I enjoyed the first by Boyle) has to make his dread choice, and then he's running, running, running to the dock with those crazed ""zombies"" is really horrifying. I felt that buzz of suspense. Sure, I knew he had to survive to make the film continue, but it was directed in such a way that it worked. Scary!The futuristic concept of the isolated zone, military-controlled, the soldiers getting a bit lax, the survivors waiting for life to normalize, etc, all that felt nicely post-apocalyptic. I had, however, a hard time buying that anyone would really want to come back from a safe US to a corpse-riddled, ravaged London. Come on. Would you? Naw. I'm thinking I'd ask for asylum. It strained credulity.The whole reunion, angst, the dread of when the next virus surge would come, that was all well-done. But once the infection strikes again, it pretty much mostly goes to a place that bored me. Bloody and gory and brutal, but boring. And I had a very hard time sympathizing with the kids. When one stops caring if the children in a story live or die--that's problematic. I stopped caring. And yet, their situation was so awful, I should have cared. The script did not MAKE me care if they got eaten by ragies.The ending, however, had a glorious final bit of visual action. It sets this up for yet a third film in this storyline, too. But I doubt I'll be excited to watch it if it's going to do the same downhill slide as this one did in the second part. Suggestion: Make me care that the people survive, the way I did in the first film. I gotta want the leads to make it, or why watch?

The sequel tries very hard to capitalize on the first, but the plot points are so ludicrous that I was never able to obtain complete ""suspension of disbelief"" and enjoy the film.  SPOILER ALERT:  The biggest problem with this movie is the very premise it is based on:  the re-populating of London.  There was an outbreak of a virus that could very easily have spelled the end of the whole world, yet they start sending people back to London before it is even completely cleaned up.  There are still dead and, presumably, infected bodies all over the place yet people are moving back in.  Sure, they move back into a fenced in compound but THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN before the whole place was decontaminated.  Then, a couple of kids breach army defenses at the compound and head out into the city.  As if they wouldn't have been shot on sight.

So in short 28 Weeks Later is one of a very few zombies flick that gives George Romero's zombies a run for it's money, A MUST SEE MOVIE!!!!",4,Rage is back with a Vengance,1208563200,"04 19, 2008",2008,1041,"['When', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'was', 'unleshed', '2002', 'was', 'praised', 'best', 'horror', 'film', '2002', 'also', 'reinvented', 'zombies', 'gave', 'good', 'reason', 'run', 'thesse', 'were', 'not', ""'re"", 'slow', 'moving', 'George', 'Romero', 'zombies', 'were', ""'re"", 'red', 'eyed', 'rage', 'filled', 'blood', 'vomiting', 'p**ed', 'off', 'zombies', 'can', 'run', 'as', 'fast', 'can', '5', 'Years', 'later', 'get', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'view', 'much', 'better', '1st', 'one', 'story', 'up', '6', 'mouths', 'first', 'outbreak', 'U.S.', 'goverment', 'trying', 'rebuild', 'England', 'soon', 'surviour', 'enters', 'district', '1', 'unknow', 'carrys', 'virus', 'hell', 'breaks', 'lose', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'might', 'take', 'while', 'action', 'kick', 'when', 'grabs', 'balls', 'not', 'let', 'got', 'untill', 'end', 'violence', 'can', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'zombie', 'film', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'lots', 'blood', 'So', 'short', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'zombies', 'flick', 'George', 'Romero', 'zombies', 'run', 'money', 'A', 'MUST', 'SEE', 'MOVIE']",28 Weeks Later

But the theme is pounded in a bit too strongly by a series of coincidences and implausible developments, especially when one of the zombies (I mean ""infected"") develops a personal vendetta and somehow seems to already be waiting for the main characters everywhere they happen to decide to go.Part of the appeal of the first film was that once the sci-fi/horror premise was established events unfolded very realistically and unpredictably.  In this film events seem clearly designed to fulfill a symbolic role in the working out of one man's attempt to run from the past, and of the effects of this evasion upon his family.The basic premise of the film seemed intriguing to begin with, and the opening scene was quite strong: in an act of cowardice and self-preservation a man abandons his wife to the advancing hordes of infected; this situation raises interesting questions and sets up an intriguing conflict at the heart of the film: now that he has survived how can he live with himself, and how can he face his children, who will not understand the fear that led him to such a dreadful decision?  28 Weeks Later everything looks to be under control and the survivors in London are being ""protected"" by American soldiers, against the possibility that the virus might still exist -- but of course it does or we wouldn't have a movie.Apart from the story I also found the execution of this film to be lacking.  It is obviously a bigger film than the first, with a bigger budget -- spent mostly on military action and explosions and a bigger vision of an empty and desolate London -- but this one lacks the inventiveness of the first film.  What was fresh in 28 Days Later feels gimmicky here -- okay, the zombies  can run, but does that mean that they must always be running?  Can't they ever slow down and give us time to look at the action?  The video documentary style footage here also seems just like a less effective duplicate of the style of the first one, and not so much an exciting new look -- and the frenetic editing of the zombie attacks and killings doesn't feel inventive but overdone and done to death.  It sounds odd, but after several bouts of kinetic mayhem with sprinting dead I began to find it quite boring and repetitive -- and that definitely wasn't my experience with the first film, where I was on the edge of my seat the entire time (both in the theater and when I brought it home on dvd).  The first film I would recommend to anyone who likes film (and doesn't mind a bit of blood and gore and zombie violence).

Picking up six months after the events of the first film, 28 Weeks Later centers around the United States military helping restore the mainland of Britain after the rage virus has been wiped out.  Cowardly father Don (Robert Carlyle) is re-united with his children (Imogen Poots, Mackintosh Muggleton) while everyone else tries to get back to normal.  Unbeknownst to everyone though, is that Don's thought dead wife (Catherine McCormack) is not only immune to the virus, but has become a carrier for it as well.  As you can no doubt guess, it doesn't take too long for things to get very, very bad.  Though I was a little apprehensive upon hearing that Boyle and original writer Alex Garland were only on hand as executive producers, my fears were put aside when the film kicks into high gear during it's opening sequence.  The cast is more than solid, and features Jeremy Renner (SWAT) as a heroic sniper, Rose Byrne (Danny Boyle's Sunshine and FX's Damages), Harold Perrineau (Lost, Oz), and an all too briefly seen Idris Elba (The Wire) as the stoic General Stone.  The gore ante has also been considerably upped from 28 Days Later, with some impressive and brutal effects.  All in all, 28 Weeks Later is a stunning sequel that surprisingly manages to live up to (and in some cases top) the original film, and is more than worth checking out for horror fans, zombie fans (normal or running), and fans of the first film alike.",5,Stunning and spectacular sequel,1191974400,"10 10, 2007",2007,1532,"['Danny', 'Boyle', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'great', 'horror', 'treat', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'different', 'Picking', 'up', 'six', 'months', 'events', 'first', 'film', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'centers', 'United', 'States', 'military', 'helping', 'restore', 'mainland', 'Britain', 'rage', 'virus', 'been', 'wiped', 'out', 'Cowardly', 'father', 'Don', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 're-united', 'children', 'Imogen', 'Poots', 'Mackintosh', 'Muggleton', 'everyone', 'else', 'tries', 'get', 'back', 'normal', 'Unbeknownst', 'everyone', 'Don', 'thought', 'dead', 'wife', 'Catherine', 'McCormack', 'not', 'only', 'immune', 'virus', 'become', 'carrier', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'doubt', 'guess', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'long', 'things', 'get', 'very', 'very', 'bad', 'was', 'little', 'apprehensive', 'hearing', 'Boyle', 'original', 'writer', 'Alex', 'Garland', 'were', 'only', 'hand', 'executive', 'producers', 'fears', 'were', 'put', 'aside', 'when', 'film', 'high', 'gear', 'opening', 'sequence', 'cast', 'more', 'solid', 'features', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'SWAT', 'heroic', 'sniper', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'Sunshine', 'FX', 'Damages', 'Harold', 'Perrineau', 'Lost', 'Oz', 'too', 'briefly', 'seen', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'Wire', 'stoic', 'General', 'Stone', 'gore', 'ante', 'also', 'been', 'considerably', 'upped', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'impressive', 'brutal', 'effects', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'stunning', 'sequel', 'surprisingly', 'live', 'up', 'cases', 'top', 'original', 'film', 'more', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'horror', 'fans', 'zombie', 'fans', 'normal', 'running', 'fans', 'first', 'film', 'alike']",28 Weeks Later

1090943,A3SU3TXON36T0X,B000TJBN7Q,"New Age of Barbarism ""zosimos""","[1, 1]","_28 Weeks Later_ (2007) is a post-apocalyptic science fiction film which is a sequel to _28 Days Later_ (2002) which features the response of the British government to an outbreak of the rage virus which turns men into mad zombies.  This film asks the difficult question as to how disasters should be prepared for and as to what role government should play in restoring order.  The government in this film (run by the American army) is given an ambiguous role to play.  Difficult decisions are required which often lead to the loss of life.  In one particularly disturbing scene, the rage virus breaks out and a crowd of people flee a building as the army officers are forced to shoot randomly into the crowd.  The moral question involves whether such actions are justified in light of the fact that the rage virus is spreading through human contact and that once contracted it leads to blind madness.This film begins with a group of survivors who are hiding out in an old house.  A husband and wife live together with an older family, hiding from the rage infested zombies.  However, one day a young boy comes to the house and is followed by the zombies.  The husband manages to escape but is forced to let his wife be overtaken by the virus.  The movie then focuses on the man and his children who are being brought back into the country.  The country now exists under martial law controlled by the United States military.  As it turns out however, the man's wife had a special genetic eye condition that enabled her to survive the rage virus, but she still remains a carrier of the infestation.  This leads to her infecting the populace.  The rest of the movie features the man's children and a few others trying to flee the virus as it spreads throughout the people.  Unfortunately, the man himself after making contact with his wife quickly becomes infested with the rage virus.  His children along with an army officer and a medical officer must flee the rage infested zombies.  The movie ends on a highly disturbing note.This film is good entertainment, but also raises disturbing questions concerning military preparedness and the role of government.  It is recommended for those who like such films and who would consider these issues while watching a movie of this type.",5,A Post-Apocalyptic Horror Show.,1192924800,"10 21, 2007",2007,2280,"['_28', 'Weeks', 'Later_', '2007', 'post-apocalyptic', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'sequel', '_28', 'Days', 'Later_', '2002', 'response', 'British', 'government', 'outbreak', 'rage', 'virus', 'men', 'mad', 'zombies', 'film', 'difficult', 'question', 'how', 'disasters', 'should', 'be', 'prepared', 'what', 'role', 'government', 'should', 'play', 'restoring', 'order', 'government', 'film', 'run', 'American', 'army', 'given', 'ambiguous', 'role', 'play', 'Difficult', 'decisions', 'are', 'required', 'often', 'lead', 'loss', 'life', 'one', 'particularly', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'rage', 'virus', 'out', 'crowd', 'people', 'flee', 'building', 'army', 'officers', 'are', 'forced', 'shoot', 'randomly', 'crowd', 'moral', 'question', 'such', 'actions', 'are', 'justified', 'light', 'fact', 'rage', 'virus', 'spreading', 'human', 'contact', 'once', 'contracted', 'blind', 'madness.This', 'film', 'group', 'survivors', 'who', 'are', 'hiding', 'out', 'old', 'house', 'husband', 'wife', 'live', 'together', 'older', 'family', 'hiding', 'rage', 'infested', 'zombies', 'However', 'one', 'day', 'young', 'boy', 'house', 'followed', 'zombies', 'husband', 'escape', 'forced', 'let', 'wife', 'be', 'overtaken', 'virus', 'movie', 'then', 'man', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'brought', 'back', 'country', 'country', 'now', 'martial', 'law', 'controlled', 'United', 'States', 'military', 'out', 'however', 'man', 'wife', 'had', 'special', 'genetic', 'eye', 'condition', 'enabled', 'survive', 'rage', 'virus', 'still', 'carrier', 'infestation', 'infecting', 'populace', 'rest', 'movie', 'man', 'children', 'few', 'others', 'trying', 'flee', 'virus', 'people', 'Unfortunately', 'man', 'making', 'contact', 'wife', 'quickly', 'infested', 'rage', 'virus', 'children', 'army', 'officer', 'medical', 'officer', 'must', 'flee', 'rage', 'infested', 'zombies', 'movie', 'highly', 'disturbing', 'note.This', 'film', 'good', 'entertainment', 'also', 'disturbing', 'questions', 'concerning', 'military', 'preparedness', 'role', 'government', 'recommended', 'who', 'like', 'such', 'films', 'who', 'would', 'consider', 'issues', 'watching', 'movie', 'type']",28 Weeks Later

The synopsis looks promising: weeks later, the original infected people on the UK dies... and the country is declared safe. So it is up to the British living abroad to come home and start again. And we meet this guy who has two kids (who were abroad on a school trip).Suddenly, they find his wife (who apparently got attacked and died on the prologue). But she is fine... because she is immune to the disease. But she does has the virus... and it is only a matter of time until the whole thing starts again.The problem with 28 WEEKS LATER is that the audience does not bond with any character. There is nobody there for the audience to empathize with. I feel some lack of focus in those characters... and the whole film becomes a escapist time-passing.It was exactly the huge investment in characters that made the first film so good. But here... It's all missing.That is not to say that there are not great moments. The intro (when the guy loses his wife) is well paced... the scene where the helicopter decapitates (oh, yes!!!) a group of infected is fabulous... and the best sequence is when the survivors drive away from the military dodging poison gas clouds on the streets of London.But that's it.Also... this film contradicts one interesting element presented in the first film.

1090954,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B000TJBN7Q,Poor Napoleon,"[1, 1]","When I heard there would be a sequel to 28 Days Later sans Danny Boyle I was deeply dissapointed.  For one, a sequel to suck a great film just seemed to be a cheap cash in on the successful low budget first film.  For two, the talent was gone.  The first one had such a good conclusion, that a sequel seemed like it would just sully the original's story.28 Weeks Later doesn't fall victim to the folly of most sequels, however.  It also doesn't follow standard horror formula, as per the first film.  It's frightening, yes, but this is a film hardly chock full of idiotic one dimensional characters.  At the center is a family - part of one anyway.  Two children just return to see their father after mainland England has been all but wiped out by the rage virus.  They believe their mom is dead and soon discover she is still alive, with infection but without the symptoms.  The tension within the family sets off a series of events that allow the rage to take over once more.What makes the film successful is that this is not just a cheapened version of the first. It has first rate characters played by first rate actors.  Most notable is Robert Carlyle, as the father who's fear, regret, and lies lead to the virus being unleashed again.  One one side, we're feeling sorry for him, but also want to condemn his actions.  The children are the real central characters as we follow them through the film trying to survive. The actors are incredibly believable in their roles, with the characters continually making more realistic choices than you'd see in a standard horror film.Largely absent from this film that was in the first are the grander themes that made the first film so great.  There are still some rather intelligent observations on how the government reacts to the outbreak, where the military is seen taking all lives, including civilians.  Throughout the film, we are questioning their tactics and morality.The only dissapointment falls in probably the last few minutes of the film.  They obviously intend to spin this off into a franchise, but the last moments of the film make me feel like they may ruin what they have by creating run of the mill zombie pics.  However, it's only a few minutes we're talking about.  The rest of the film is dazzling, down to the attention taken to effects, music, and ambience.

1090961,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000TJBN7Q,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[59, 68]","28 Weeks Later... (Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, 2007)So Alex Garland didn't write the 28 Days Later... sequel, nor did Danny Boyle direct it. I felt a bit better about this after hearing that the reason for both was time issues/contractual obligations (both were involved in the much-anticipated Sunshine when this got off the ground). So they brought in Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (Intacto) to both co-write and direct. I was still a touch leery walking into the theater, but the end result is that the movie was not as good as I'd hoped-- but a great deal better than I expected.We start off with a group of survivors holed up in a cottage at the beginning of the outbreak (if you saw the original, the opening scene happens, presumably, while Cillian Murphy's character is still in a coma). Two of the people stuck there are Alice (Catherine McCormack) and Don (Robert Carlyle). During dinner one night, there's a pounding on the door, and they admit a young boy (Gary Robert Kelly's favorite actor, Beans El-Balawi). Unfortunately, the infected are hot on his tail, and you can guess the rest. Don escapes. 28 weeks later, the repatriation of Britain begins, and Don's kids Andy (the similarly wonderfully-named Mackintosh Muggleton in his first screen role) and Tammy (V for Vendetta's Imogen Poots) are reunited with him. But, as you know if you've seen thirty seconds of any trailer to the film, maybe they were a bit hasty in bringing people back to the island...The good news is that Boyle did, in fact, act as second unit director, and directed a few scenes. The bad news, which isn't really so bad, is that it's pretty obvious which scenes they are. While the behind-the-scenes stuff they've been showing on TV singles out Boyle's direction of the opening scene, there are a few others scattered throughout as well. Boyle's adrenaline-rush jump cuts show up now and again, and there's an almost eerie similarity to the first film in those scenes. This is helped along by the fact that the producers used, for all intents and purposes, the same soundtrack John Murphy came up with for the first film, but without the silly happy synthesizer stuff that popped up now and again in that one. (And no uncredited Godspeed You Black Emperor! tracks this time round, either.) That said, Fresnadillo is a strong director in his own right, and he holds his own here. The story is less epic than the first one, with the focus squarely on Don and his kids, along with two army officers who try to help them escape the new outbreak of contagion. This could have easily become a weakness, with such a simple storyline, but Fresnadillo turns it into a strength. There are a lot of places where he could have branched out, and frankly I'd have liked to see some of them, but he kept focus throughout. He also didn't make the usual sequel mistake of showing the monsters too much, sticking to Boyle's original jump-cut plan when the infected get screen time (which is surprisingly little, actually); you get flashes, but with one ugly exception towards the end of the movie, we never get the whole ""let's unveil the monster in all its glory"" wankery so common in horror films with big effects budgets. (And even in the exception, he keeps it to a minimum and still uses the close-ups that make the infected so scary in the first place.) There were a few times I wished Garland had written the script, but Fresnadillo and his compatriots (who include the BAFTA-nominated Rowan Joffe) did well, for the most part.The one truly weak point in the movie is that it's all set up very conveniently. You have a basic idea of what's coming from the first big plot twist (or, if you're more observant than I am, about ten minutes into the movie). That said, Fresnadillo still has a trick or two up his sleeve for the big payoff at the end of the movie, and oh, the payoff is so very, very worth it. Everything's set up nicely, and then Fresnadillo and co. sweep everything we think we know off the table.Now, I know there are a few people who aren't going to like the sequel no matter what because it's a sequel, but in general, if you liked the first one, I think you'll get a kick out of this one, as well.

1090963,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000TJBN7Q,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","""28 Weeks Later"" picks up where ""28 Days Later"" left off.  The virus that's been turning ordinary human beings into flesh-eating zombies has apparently run its course, the infected humans have all died of starvation, and Britain is slowly being repopulated with many of the citizens who fled the scene at the start of the epidemic.  One of those returnees is Don (played by Robert Carlyle), who is suffering from survivor's guilt after leaving his wife in a moment of panic to be devoured by the creatures.  Or was she?  Suffice it to say, it's hard to keep a good virus down and soon London is in the grip of a major new outbreak of the illness.  Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner, Imogen Poots and MacKintosh Muggleton (what a great name!) play various characters who spend the bulk of the movie running for their lives from the menace.Zombie pictures have become such a staple of the horror movie genre that it is hard for anyone to do anything particularly novel or original with them anymore.  Zombie bites human, human turns into zombie, new zombie bites another human, and on it goes ad infinitum.  That scenario may have been fresh and exciting when George Romero first introduced it to the world in ""Night of the Living Dead"" back in 1968, but it has been diluted through repetition and overuse ever since (partly by Romero himself with his endless, ever diminishing variations on the theme).  The one innovation the original ""28 Days Later"" came up with was to speed up the zombies' movements so that they were no longer the lumbering creatures that anyone's 85-year-old granny could easily outrun.""28 Weeks Later"" has some genuinely suspenseful moments and a nice post-apocalyptic feel in its early stretches, but, like its predecessor, it tends to devolve into a tedious shooting-gallery sideshow the longer it goes on.  Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's hurdy-gurdy filmmaking style, which is intended to replicate the chaos and pandemonium of the situation, often leads more to confusion than to clarification for the audience.  Still, the movie contains a few cool plot twists and raises some thorny ethical issues, such as whether or not innocent people are to be sacrificed if that means ensuring the safety of the population as a whole.  And there is certainly more than enough bloodshed and general mayhem to keep the zombiephiles among us rooted to our seats.  Even the undead can have fun with that.",3,"decent, if unspectacular, zombie film",1218240000,"08 9, 2008",2008,2413,"['28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'up', 'where', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'left', 'off', 'virus', 'been', 'turning', 'ordinary', 'human', 'beings', 'flesh-eating', 'zombies', 'apparently', 'run', 'course', 'infected', 'humans', 'have', 'died', 'starvation', 'Britain', 'slowly', 'being', 'repopulated', 'many', 'citizens', 'who', 'fled', 'scene', 'start', 'epidemic', 'One', 'returnees', 'Don', 'played', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'who', 'suffering', 'survivor', 'guilt', 'leaving', 'wife', 'moment', 'panic', 'be', 'devoured', 'creatures', 'was', 'Suffice', 'say', 'hard', 'keep', 'good', 'virus', 'down', 'soon', 'London', 'grip', 'major', 'new', 'outbreak', 'illness', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Imogen', 'Poots', 'MacKintosh', 'Muggleton', 'what', 'great', 'name', 'play', 'various', 'characters', 'who', 'spend', 'bulk', 'movie', 'running', 'lives', 'menace.Zombie', 'pictures', 'have', 'become', 'staple', 'horror', 'movie', 'genre', 'hard', 'anyone', 'do', 'anything', 'particularly', 'novel', 'original', 'anymore', 'Zombie', 'human', 'human', 'zombie', 'new', 'zombie', 'human', 'ad', 'infinitum', 'scenario', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'when', 'George', 'Romero', 'first', 'introduced', 'world', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'back', '1968', 'been', 'diluted', 'repetition', 'overuse', 'ever', 'partly', 'Romero', 'endless', 'ever', 'diminishing', 'variations', 'theme', 'one', 'innovation', 'original', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'came', 'up', 'was', 'speed', 'up', 'zombies', 'movements', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'lumbering', 'anyone', '85-year-old', 'granny', 'could', 'easily', 'outrun', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'genuinely', 'suspenseful', 'moments', 'nice', 'post-apocalyptic', 'feel', 'early', 'stretches', 'predecessor', 'devolve', 'tedious', 'shooting-gallery', 'sideshow', 'longer', 'Director', 'Juan', 'Carlos', 'Fresnadillo', 'hurdy-gurdy', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'intended', 'replicate', 'chaos', 'pandemonium', 'situation', 'often', 'more', 'confusion', 'clarification', 'audience', 'Still', 'movie', 'few', 'cool', 'plot', 'twists', 'thorny', 'ethical', 'issues', 'such', 'not', 'innocent', 'people', 'are', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'ensuring', 'safety', 'population', 'whole', 'certainly', 'more', 'enough', 'bloodshed', 'general', 'mayhem', 'keep', 'zombiephiles', 'rooted', 'seats', 'Even', 'undead', 'can', 'have', 'fun']",28 Weeks Later

After all, we know who Batman is, and what powers Superman has, yet there is potential for a very good film to be made from familiar material.Several people have mentioned the huge plot holes.  For instance, here is a woman who has survived for 28 weeks, yet is infected.  Somehow, she is immune to the ravages of the 'Rage' virus, yet is a carrier.  That's possible (see 'Typhoid Mary').  This is the only person ever discovered to have this trait (at least so far).  Yet they strap her into a bed...and disappear!  No patient in real life is strapped into a bed and then just ignored.  And this is no regular patient.  She may represent a cure for a terrible, terrible disease.And then there is the question, why bring back people at all?  They bring something like 15,000 people back, put them on an island, connected by bridges loosely guarded, and expect nothing to happen?  Why not wait for, say, a couple of years?  Or, perhaps, until they discover a cure for the virus, or a vaccine?OK, the premise of the movie is what it is.  The question is, is the movie worth seeing?  I'd say YES.It's scary.  We know what the infected are capable of.  The can do superhuman feats of destruction, trying to kill whatever they can kill.  They are gruesome, they are bloody, they are fast, and they are uncontrollable.The movie made me jump several times, and held my interest during the entire film.The movie is all the more frightening when you consider that we have a threat that is facing us right now, that is all too real - bird flu.  The bad thing?  The incubation period is not seconds as it is with the rage flu (handy to tell if your patient is now infected), but days or perhaps weeks.  The infection could spread around the world before we even know it is there.Be afraid.28 Weeks Later is recommended.  BTW, the extra features on the DVD are interesting and informative.

""28 Weeks Later,"" sequel to the breakout smash ""28 Days Later"" follows that rule with gusto, but the movie emerges as a surprisingly thoughtful-yet-action-packed entry into a crowded genre.Helmed by relative newcomer Juan Carlos Fresnadillo - a hot young talent from Spain - ""28 Weeks Later"" stays true with what worked in the first movie- realistic yet gory violence capped only by virtuoso special effects showing a London decimated by the zombie horde.  The ""ragers"" unleashed in the first movie are up to their old tricks, running down anyone with a pulse and ""converting"" them into ragers (or lunch) through bodily fluids and nasty bites.  A terrifying opening sequence sees our ""hero,"" Don (Robert Carlyle of ""Full Monty"" fame) abandon his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack of ""Dangerous Beauty"") to be mauled by the ragers.  He barely escapes with his life back to safety - London ruled by the U.S. Army.But the city ain't safe for long.  Alice shows up from beyond the grave, and she's a ""carrier"" of the rage virus.  Before long (and I don't think I'm giving anything away here, since the ads show the ragers taking over London) there's another outbreak.  An intrepid band of survivors must get to safety.  But where is it?One of the strengths of this movie is that nobody is safe - often a character will get identified as a ""safe hero"" whom you think will survive all the carnage, only to get offed in spectacular fashion.  The result is a terrifying, edge-of-your-seat movie.  A bare-bones plot - survive - adds to the terror, as does the quip-free dialogue.  This is a strong, intelligent movie, not a clever, hip one that will be dated six weeks after release.  And the movie is mercifully free of gratuitous sex and shower scenes - this is a movie that focuses on the frightening, not the titilation.If you're a fan of horror films, you've probably already seen this movie.  If not, get ""28 Days Later"" first - you'll need the limited back story to really appreciate this movie.

This film the children take over with their TSTL (too stupid to live) antics, and the plot devolves into horror/slasher formula. The moment the children arrived in the military zone I predicted they'd do something really moronic. I was disappointed to be right.I enabled close captions, which was convenient when I fast forwarded all the chase scenes that the director apparently considered plot development.

1090971,A2TCHXH4SIN2OF,B000TJBN7Q,"Severian ""Severian""","[2, 2]","I disliked the original in this series for two reasons: first, the illogical and stupid conduct of some characters that acts to set up contrived moments of terror and disaster, and second, the clich&eacute;d portrayal of military characters as amoral incompetent thugs. I liked the sequel quite a bit better, though the first issue does recur to some degree.First, the plot in a nutshell: the Rage virus which turns its victims into living berserkers has burned its way through the UK, killing many and causing a mass evacuation of the survivors. The rage victims lack the focus to eat and so starve to death in about six months, allowing a cautious US led repopulation of the British Isles, beginning with the Isle of Dogs in London. The film follows the lives of one particularly unique family during the attempted resettlement and the new outbreak of the Rage virus that threatens to destroy the new society and the family as well.This movie offers all the scariness of the first one with the beginning sequence and the auditorium outbreak standing out as especially scary set-pieces. What 28 Weeks has over 28 Days is a bigger budget, less boring downtime moments (let's watch the survivor shave without using water!), and more of an epic scope. The helicopter versus zombies moment takes the classic Romero moment from Dawn of the Dead and redoes it on a heroic scale, and the action sequences are expertly filmed and choreographed.The politics of the movie seem at first to be a condemnation of America in Iraq, but the military characters are nowhere near as villainous as those in the original, and the brutal quarantine methods used seem sadly appropriate given the risks of an outbreak. Ironically, the spreading of Rage to the Continent is directly a result of soldiers disobeying orders and allowing their humanity to cause them to waive the ""Code Red"" orders. The theme of the US Army standing by impotently in the Green Zone as civilians kill each other and the soldiers in fits of savage insanity while the attempt to rebuild a shattered nation fails of course has more than a little topicality, but the theme is nuanced, not heavy-handed, and ultimately the viewer can take it or leave it and still enjoy the movie.The characters this time around are generally well-portrayed though we do not see much exposition about their backstories or perspectives, due to the fast pace and frequent action. The family under siege is excellent with Carlyle and McCormack standing out in fairly skimpy roles, and the kids being somewhat weaker. The military characters including even the commanding general are well done, and one senses the horror and sense of loss the soldiers are experiencing even as they execute unthinkable orders. The scene in the control room as all the CCTV cameras slowly blank out is superbly done.What are the problems? Well, mainly with the contingency planning of the military. Perhaps the military planners are deliberately intended to seem like morons (perhaps oblique Iraq commentary?), but the huge flaws in planning that allow the outbreak to quickly reach crisis levels seem to be pretty noticeable ones. For instance, in case an infectious subject is found and isolated, why place them in a lab without any guards or observation? The whole sequence where the guilty (and apparently horny) Robert Carlyle is infected by his wife, transforms into a carrier over the space of a few minutes, kills his wife, and then breaks out of the lab should simply not be possible given the ludicrously high security levels established earlier in the film. There are guards every 10 yards in the cafeteria, a sniper on every rooftop, soldiers in every metro car, but no guards at all in the medical quarantine section to keep watch over the main risk of re-infection. (Carlyle's swapping of spit with his as yet non-medically cleared wife is also a fairly astounding decision on the personal level, but let's assume he's under strong emotional influence...)Then once an outbreak is verified, the military herds everyone together into one huge auditorium. With any disease, let along Rage, this would be a rotten idea. Why not lock everyone down in their individual apartments and then slowly release all those confirmed as being uninfected once the common areas are secure? On top of that, once everyone is herded into the central area, the lights are then turned off (which incidentally hinders the soldiers fighting the infected much more than it does the infected themselves). Finally, the high security assembly point for the unarmed and unguarded civilians is then breached easily by Carlyle busting through some flimsily chained doors (yes, we know he has high access clearance, but we don't know if the Infected remember how to use swipe cards, and as I said we do not see Carlyle using any sort of unlocking key, just bashing open a door.). He then infects many in the helpless imprisoned crowd, elevating the situation rapidly from outbreak to crisis.Once we get past these stupendously jaw-dropping moments of incompetence, the rest of the movie avoids any other obvious ""whoops!"" moments, though the durability, mobility, and tracking acumen of the infected Carlyle maybe is a tad unlikely, but the ""lead zombie"" position in most horror flicks is an old and honorable tradition. The great leaps in credulity needed to advance the plot to its mature stages still stand out in the viewers mind, and the script could have been done better to avoid requiring the viewer to make quite so many suspensions of disbelief.Overall this film is gorier, more nihilistic, faster paced, and more heart-breaking than its predecessor. I feel it is a better horror movie, and the ambiguous though still pungent political overtones add a certain zest to the mix. The cinematography is excellent, the stunts look great, and we see an excellent cast portraying characters we come to like and care about even as they venture deeper and deeper into harm's way. Most of those who liked 28 Days will like this as much or more, and those who disliked 28 Days' occasionally sluggish pacing, limited scope, and tired ""soldiers are bad"" subtext will enjoy 28 Weeks

Of course it doesn't go well. Soon the main protagonists are on a mad dash across the devastated city in an attempt to escape from a crazed bunch of newly-infected. The tension and horror are successfully ramped up as the film progresses. There's plenty of gore for those who like their movies drenched in blood.

1090974,AUV0EFKWA46TX,B000TJBN7Q,shaxper,"[2, 4]","28 Days Later was an amazing film in terms of what it did for the post-apocalyptic zombie genre.  The camera work, special effects, and of course modifications to the general zombie premise were all sheer genius.  However, I felt no particular attachment to the story, itself.  28 Weeks Later, however, uses the same premise and directing style to deliver something far more terrifying, thought-provoking, and generally powerful.The film begins around the time of the first one, with a band of survivors, including a loving husband and wife, holed up in a boarded shack, trying to wait out the infestation.  As the infected inevitably break in, husband Don is forced to make a difficult decision.  After doing an impressive job of fending off the attackers, he tries to take his wife into hiding, but she chooses, instead, to run off and protect an innocent child.  As the infected swarm around her, she begs for Don to help her, but he knows (as well as we do) that she's done for.  He makes the hard decision and runs for it.  As he leaves the house, tearing across a sunny field with hundreds of infected chasing behind him, he looks back and sees his wife, still banging against the upstairs window, begging him to save her with accusing eyes.Inevitably, these kinds of hard decisions come to frame the narrative of this story.  As London is eventually rebuilt and repopulated, and as Don is reunited with his lost children (all the while secretly enduring the guilt of his decision), a new infection breaks out, character after character is forced to make such tough decisions, and the writing team is realistically merciless with those who choose to play hero.  It's a tough, at times even cruel film where fate never intervenes to protect the good guys against improbable odds.  Still, the film never leaves you questioning what the right course of action is, even in spite of the consequences it will bring.It's an amazingly powerful film for just such a reason, the kind that entertains and terrifies the heck out of you the entire time, yet leaves you with an amazing three hour discussion on ethics and altruism to ponder with friends afterward.And please don't get the impression that, just because this is an intelligent, thoughtful film, it must therefore not be all that scary or action-intensive.  It's been a while since I saw the original 28 Days Later, but I'm reasonably sure this was far more intense.  Each ""scary"" scene seemed more intense than the one before, often using claustrophobia, darkness, and a highly unpredictable plot to keep me on the edge.Speaking of the plot, I think that's probably the point that polarizes the lovers and haters of this film.  It takes nearly half the film for the outbreak to happen, and I can see why people looking for a mindless, action-packed horror flick would find that frustrating.  As it happens, I found that mostly bloodless first half to be thoughtful, rich in character and drama, and above all else, unpredictable.  It kept leaving me to wonder how things were finally going to go wrong.  Where was the surviving infection going to come from?  Indeed, once the blood starts splattering, the plot manages to stay somewhat unpredictable.  Many thing happened, especially toward the end, that I did not expect at all.In the end, I think 28 Weeks Later's only problem is that it isn't a mindless adrenaline rush from start to finish.  The film asks you to think, feel and care, but this ultimately makes the scream-intensive second half far more thrilling than your standard fare.",5,28 Times Better (but also incredibly different),1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,3548,"['28', 'Days', 'Later', 'was', 'amazing', 'film', 'terms', 'what', 'did', 'post-apocalyptic', 'zombie', 'genre', 'camera', 'work', 'special', 'effects', 'course', 'modifications', 'general', 'zombie', 'premise', 'were', 'sheer', 'genius', 'However', 'felt', 'particular', 'attachment', 'story', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'however', 'same', 'premise', 'directing', 'style', 'deliver', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'terrifying', 'thought-provoking', 'generally', 'powerful.The', 'film', 'time', 'first', 'one', 'band', 'survivors', 'including', 'loving', 'husband', 'wife', 'holed', 'up', 'boarded', 'shack', 'trying', 'wait', 'out', 'infestation', 'infected', 'inevitably', 'break', 'husband', 'Don', 'forced', 'make', 'difficult', 'decision', 'doing', 'impressive', 'job', 'fending', 'off', 'attackers', 'take', 'wife', 'hiding', 'instead', 'run', 'off', 'protect', 'innocent', 'child', 'infected', 'swarm', 'Don', 'help', 'as', 'well', 'do', 'done', 'hard', 'decision', 'house', 'tearing', 'sunny', 'field', 'hundreds', 'infected', 'chasing', 'back', 'wife', 'still', 'banging', 'upstairs', 'window', 'begging', 'save', 'accusing', 'eyes.Inevitably', 'kinds', 'hard', 'decisions', 'come', 'frame', 'narrative', 'story', 'London', 'eventually', 'rebuilt', 'repopulated', 'Don', 'reunited', 'lost', 'children', 'while', 'secretly', 'enduring', 'guilt', 'decision', 'new', 'infection', 'breaks', 'out', 'character', 'character', 'forced', 'make', 'such', 'tough', 'decisions', 'writing', 'team', 'realistically', 'merciless', 'who', 'choose', 'play', 'hero', 'tough', 'times', 'even', 'cruel', 'film', 'where', 'fate', 'never', 'intervenes', 'protect', 'good', 'guys', 'improbable', 'odds', 'Still', 'film', 'never', 'questioning', 'what', 'right', 'course', 'action', 'even', 'spite', 'consequences', 'will', 'bring.It', 'amazingly', 'powerful', 'film', 'just', 'reason', 'kind', 'heck', 'entire', 'time', 'yet', 'amazing', 'three', 'hour', 'discussion', 'ethics', 'altruism', 'ponder', 'friends', 'afterward.And', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'impression', 'just', 'intelligent', 'thoughtful', 'film', 'must', 'therefore', 'not', 'be', 'scary', 'action-intensive', 'been', 'while', 'saw', 'original', '28', 'Days', 'Later', ""'m"", 'reasonably', 'sure', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'intense', 'scary', 'scene', 'seemed', 'more', 'intense', 'one', 'often', 'using', 'claustrophobia', 'darkness', 'highly', 'unpredictable', 'plot', 'keep', 'edge.Speaking', 'plot', 'think', 'probably', 'point', 'lovers', 'haters', 'film', 'nearly', 'film', 'outbreak', 'happen', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'looking', 'mindless', 'action-packed', 'horror', 'flick', 'would', 'find', 'frustrating', 'found', 'mostly', 'bloodless', 'first', 'half', 'be', 'thoughtful', 'rich', 'character', 'drama', 'else', 'unpredictable', 'kept', 'leaving', 'wonder', 'how', 'things', 'were', 'finally', 'going', 'go', 'wrong', 'Where', 'was', 'surviving', 'infection', 'going', 'come', 'Indeed', 'once', 'blood', 'splattering', 'plot', 'stay', 'somewhat', 'unpredictable', 'Many', 'thing', 'happened', 'especially', 'end', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'end', 'think', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'only', 'problem', ""n't"", 'mindless', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'start', 'finish', 'film', 'think', 'feel', 'care', 'ultimately', 'scream-intensive', 'second', 'half', 'far', 'more', 'thrilling', 'standard', 'fare']",28 Weeks Later
1090975,A1HJZ1SBR0ROHH,B000TJBN7Q,"Shayne ""- Shayne""","[12, 14]","28 Days Later was one of those pre-hyped horror films that generated a lot of buzz before its release. I saw the film in the theaters during that hype, liked the film, but I think the hype machine left me with expectations that were extremely high. I appreciated the film much more after I bought it on DVD. The first film is a clever and creepy ""zombie"" film that also touches on the possibility of how we would survive if an entire city was wiped out by some kind of infection.28 Weeks Later was a differenct story for me. I went in with low expectations thinking I would experience a quick cash in sequel but to my surprise this film was made with a great deal of integrity and respect for the original. It follows that whole theory that the second time around everything is a bit bigger and louder, but it offers us this without compromising the story. 28 Weeks Later is a welcomed chapter in the frightening look of what would happen if we lost control during an outbreak of a violent infection. Needless to say, from a horror film standpoint, this is the best one to come out in awhile.28 Weeks Later is a direct sequel to Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, although none of the characters from the first film have returned. Instead, we follow a new group of individuals from their first harrowing encounters with the infected during the initial terrorizing of Britain to their attempts to repopulate London six months later. Don (Robert Carlyle) and Alice (Catherine McCormack) have two children, Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton). The kids are in Spain during the outbreak, while Don and Alice are in hiding. When their hideout is discovered by a group of infected, the cowardly Don runs off, assuming that Alice has been killed. 28 weeks later, the kids come home, but it isn't long before it becomes apparent the crisis isn't over. Members of the U.S. military, including the lead medic (Rose Byrne), a sharpshooter (Jeremy Renner), and a helicopter pilot (Harold Perrineau), try to contain the new epidemic but it spreads too fast and too violently, triggering the ultimate solution: Code Red.This film had me hooked from the start. The opening scene did what no horror film has done in recent memory: it made me jump out of my seat. That first initial break in during the first 10 minutes was exceptionally well done and it really threw me head first into the story. Intense is probably the best way to describe this scene and the film is filled with many intense moments that should entertain the viewer.Despite all the entertainment provided by the action, the films smaller moments probably are the highlights. The first film did a great job of creating the isolation and decaying nature of London after the infection outbreak. This atmosphere is wonderfully re-created here with several overhead helicopter shots of an empty London, looking incredibly creepy. Both films tapped into my fear of just being alone in a potential situation like this. The idea of this is no different from being one of few survivors if we had a nuclear fall out. I also dug the idea of repopulating Britain but under strict guidelines to ensure that the infected could not break out again. It made me think of what could happen we had to be in a similar situation. The idea of being under such a lockdown is even more terrifying than the infected that are represented in this film.The acting is top notch from all involved. If I have one complaint is that I cared more about the characters in the first film but since the cast has been expanded a bit this time around, I can see why character development couldn't be properly explored. Actors like Robert Carlyle and Harold Parrineau for instance are criminally underused and we aren't given much insight into their personalities. They do a decent job, especially Carlyle but they aren't given enough to do. The children played by Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton are truly the only characters who garner our sympathy and they do a damn good job of it too. Not merely because they're children but because they do a great job of making their characters believeable and easy to relate to given the situaton. Jason Renner and Rose Byrne also provide adequate support with Byrne creating a female character that is strong and believable.I want to talk a bit about the shakey cam because in most reviews I read, even those that liked it, many people have complained about the shakey cam. I'm not a fan of this device. I think quick edits take away from the action taking place on screen and it also makes it extremely hard to tell what's going on. The action scenes in Batman Begins are an example of this. I love that film but my only complaint was that the hand to hand combat scenes were so hard to get into because the quick edits made it difficult to tell what was going on. To my surprise, the shakey cam in this film, added to the visceral experience of the film. There are many moments where it is hard to tell what is going on when the infected strike but the screams of horror and the snarls of the infected was all I needed to hear in order to truly feel the horror of the experience. The quick edits actually made many of the scenes much more intense.  The best example of this is during the code red scene when everyone is looked  down and one of the infected breaks in and begain to infect everyone. The scene is mostly dark but  the intensity of how quick it was taking place, made the scene all the more frightening. The slower action scenes work as well (especially the various sniper scenes towards the end and a very frightening night vision scene that had my theater shrieking a bit) but I did appreciate the quick cuts this time around. You win this round shakey cam!I think when the summer movie season is over 28 Weeks Later will be remembered as one of the pleasant surprises of the season. I'm not sure how well it will do financially compared to the original film since the horror genre has been milked to death between 2006 and 2007. If the film doesn't register in theaters, I think it will definitely find a great home on DVD. This is a welcomed companion piece to 28 Days Later and it's a truly frightening experience that did not disappoint in the slightest.

Right from the opening scenes this will have you hooked. Robert Carlyle as Donald Harris is holed up in a remote house with his wife and some other survivors. This immediately brings 'Night of the Living' to mind, and '28 Weeks Later' can certainly be compared with that ground breaking film.There are a number of brilliantly realised set pieces in this film. One near the start and another that hinges around a plot twist, which you might see coming, but I didn't. It also has some genuinely creepy moments , most noteably in the London Underground, where frankly I didn't want to watch (but had to). The acting is all of a very high standard and the Director has done a fine job recreating the sort of post-apocalyptic feel that the first film had.My only real criticisms are that sometimes I found the fast-cutting a little too fast for my liking, but maybe I'm just getting old. Also there is a rather unlikely scene near the end which seemed a little contrived. However the actual ending was very good and certainly left the producers an opening to make another film.

The film follows the plight of a family of survivors of the rage outbreak, A father and his two children who have been separated and are reunited in an American made quarantine in the middle of London. The Father tries his best to start a new life and start a relationship with his two astrained children but is burdened by guilt for being unable to save his wife during a bloody zombie attack. (The father plays the tragic character of the film and I couldn't help but feel heart felt sympathy for him.) The quarantine is working and no reports of the infected are announced. The father has a good job as an engineer and things are going smoothly but the children are restless from being bottled up. They escape form the quarantine in an attempt to locate their old home. When they finally find their house what they find there may compromise their lives and unleash the Rage Outbreak once again. 28 weeks is the perfect sequel to 28 days.

1090984,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B000TJBN7Q,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[0, 1]","Although they aren't the undead, the ravenous hordes in the ""28 Days..."" films are close enough to what zombies have come to represent, to be counted as de facto zombies.  And thus what we have here is one of the greatest zombie movies ever made, a horrifying, apocalyptic, well-made, character-rich movie that succeeds brilliantly in both the explosive, action-packed scenes and the character driven, story-building ones.  Twenty-eight weeks after the conclusion of28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)(I should stop now to point out that if you haven't seen the first one yet, you might not want to read this or any other review of the sequel until you have), the infected hordes in the quarantined United Kingdom have long since perished from hunger and general 'burn-out'.  Plans have been carefully made to begin reintroducing some of the millions of refugees back into England.  A multinational military effort spearheaded by the United States takes charge of clearing out safe zones, transporting the first waves back in, and guarding the 'safe' section of London against the as-yet unsecured rest of the country.  Unbeknownst to anybody, not far from the safe zone, a peculiar survivor remains, one who doesn't seem to be infected....at least not in the way the others were.When a series of unforseen events, involving - among other things - a previously unknown variant of the infection, results in a breach of the safe zone, things very quickly go from bad to worse, and the military command responds with a shockingly ruthless decision that prompts some of its soldiers to turn and take matters into their own hands to try and save some of London's newly re-introduced inhabitants, who now have multiple problems to worry about.There's a lot more to it than that, but I'm trying to avoid giving too much of it away, or too much towards the end.  That's the basic scenario, and blurring the lines between the good guys and the bad guys is one of the things that makes ""28 Weeks Later"" work so well.  Things unfold in unexpected ways, there are some very innovative scenes, and overall it feels very fresh and unpredictable in spite of the 1,273 other zombie movies out there (that's an exageration, but maybe not by much).  Now a lot of those movies are very good (and some are pretty bad) but this is one of the ones that really stands out from the pack. Some have said that the movie's other elements - the extended time before the breakout, the military prescence itself, etc. - took away too much time from the zombies themselves, but I'd disagree.  That was a bit of a problem withLand of the Dead (Unrated Edition)(still a good movie) but here they got the balance and the pacing just right, in my opinion.The ending is a memorable shocker, a should-have-seen-it-coming-but-didn't moment, and casts the whole film in a new light.  Well-acted with great effects and a terrific musical score, 28 Weeks Later succeeds on all levels.If you're looking for more like this, there are lots of great ones out there; among the best areNight of the Living Dead (Millennium Edition)(from 1968),Night of the Living Dead(the 1990 Remake) andDawn of the Dead (Widescreen Unrated Director's Cut)(2004).",5,"Better Than The Original, And One Of 2007's Best",1198800000,"12 28, 2007",2007,3199,"['are', ""n't"", 'undead', 'ravenous', 'hordes', '28', 'Days', 'films', 'are', 'close', 'enough', 'what', 'zombies', 'have', 'come', 'represent', 'be', 'counted', 'de', 'facto', 'zombies', 'thus', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'one', 'greatest', 'zombie', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'horrifying', 'apocalyptic', 'well-made', 'character-rich', 'movie', 'brilliantly', 'explosive', 'action-packed', 'scenes', 'character', 'driven', 'story-building', 'ones', 'Twenty-eight', 'weeks', 'conclusion', 'of28', 'Days', 'Later', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'should', 'stop', 'now', 'point', 'out', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'one', 'yet', 'might', 'not', 'want', 'read', 'other', 'review', 'sequel', 'have', 'infected', 'hordes', 'quarantined', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'have', 'long', 'perished', 'hunger', 'general', ""'burn-out"", 'Plans', 'have', 'been', 'carefully', 'made', 'begin', 'reintroducing', 'millions', 'refugees', 'back', 'England', 'A', 'multinational', 'military', 'effort', 'spearheaded', 'United', 'States', 'charge', 'clearing', 'out', 'safe', 'zones', 'transporting', 'first', 'back', 'guarding', ""'safe"", 'section', 'London', 'as-yet', 'unsecured', 'rest', 'country', 'Unbeknownst', 'anybody', 'not', 'far', 'safe', 'zone', 'peculiar', 'survivor', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'infected', 'least', 'not', 'way', 'others', 'were.When', 'series', 'unforseen', 'events', 'involving', 'other', 'things', 'previously', 'unknown', 'variant', 'infection', 'results', 'breach', 'safe', 'zone', 'things', 'very', 'quickly', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'military', 'command', 'shockingly', 'ruthless', 'decision', 'soldiers', 'turn', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'try', 'save', 'London', 'newly', 're-introduced', 'inhabitants', 'who', 'now', 'have', 'multiple', 'problems', 'worry', 'lot', 'more', ""'m"", 'trying', 'avoid', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'end', 'basic', 'scenario', 'blurring', 'lines', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'one', 'things', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'Things', 'unfold', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'are', 'very', 'innovative', 'scenes', 'overall', 'very', 'fresh', 'unpredictable', 'spite', '1,273', 'other', 'zombie', 'movies', 'there', 'exageration', 'maybe', 'not', 'much', 'Now', 'lot', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'pretty', 'bad', 'one', 'ones', 'really', 'out', 'pack', 'have', 'said', 'movie', 'other', 'elements', 'extended', 'time', 'breakout', 'military', 'prescence', 'etc', 'took', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'zombies', ""'d"", 'disagree', 'was', 'bit', 'problem', 'withLand', 'Dead', 'Unrated', 'Edition', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'here', 'got', 'balance', 'pacing', 'just', 'right', 'opinion.The', 'ending', 'memorable', 'shocker', 'should-have-seen-it-coming-but-did', ""n't"", 'moment', 'whole', 'film', 'new', 'light', 'Well-acted', 'great', 'effects', 'terrific', 'musical', 'score', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'levels.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'more', 'are', 'lots', 'great', 'ones', 'there', 'best', 'areNight', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Millennium', 'Edition', '1968', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', '1990', 'Remake', 'andDawn', 'Dead', 'Widescreen', 'Unrated', 'Director', 'Cut', '2004']",28 Weeks Later

1090993,A39H6JKOQVKZRR,B000TJBN7Q,"TFW ""Ape210""","[3, 7]","Some say that sequels are at a disadvantage to the movie going public because they take a franchise and turn the familiar and beloved into some sort of bastardized version of what got people to shell out about $10 each to see it on the big screen. Examples are Tx Chainsaw, Jaws, Batman, Superman, Ghostbusters (most of you under 30 or so won't be familiar with the term ""Ghostbuster""), etc.Don't forget though Sequels usually make more money that the originals.The upside is that it's possible to take characters and/or situations you have enjoyed in the past and play kind of a ""what if ..."" type scenario that expands the original idea and provides more insight into the original. Thus letting you the purchaser of tickets savor the story you have grown to love ie Harry Potter. Examples would be Spiderman (thank you so much Sam), Blade, Die Hard,X-Men,Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Man with No Name Eastwood movies, aaaaaannnnnnddddddd 28 weeks later.If you liked the first one it seems like you would like this one because it takes several of the ideas from the original and presents a ""what if ..."" scenario. The difference in the sequels that suck versus the sequels that soar is often the story. Does the sequel REALLY try to extend the 1st story, or is it simply a money making scheme from the film industry. Let's be smart here; Hollywood is about money and the people writing the checks to get on screen what you see on screen want their money back with interest.There are other things that make a ""successful"" movies  vs a ""box office flop"". Timing of release (Grindhouse) making the movie match the trailer (Primeval) and of course portaying the subject matter in a way that others relate to and become emotionally attached to (300).Now what would one do to make a successful ""Zombie"" movie in 2007, roughly 40 years after the idea really took off.How do you rethink what was a rethink or the whole ""zombie"" idea to start with. In fact, the fiends here aren't zombies, but ""The Infected"".What if you take say a virus that spreads like wildfire dooming you and all those around you that you love and it is secretly being made by government funded research firms.This virus, once released into the general population, is ""fixed"" by the military, which last time I checked, is also funded by the government. The way the military fixes things is by doing their job: killing people and breaking stuff (no stab at the military here, thank God you're out there protecting my children, putting your own children at risk because of how you understand that freedom is paid in blood).Thus the govt has needlessly killed all these many people for absolutely no reason other than to find out how it feels to play God and there's noone to control these mad tyrants.Fear of being alone, fear of the dark, fear of the government, fear of the military, fear of having your throat ripped out by the closest one to you. Danny Boyle and his team are brilliant. The truth about control is often a situation only fools believe in.This one may not be your favorite of the 2 so far. If you hate sequels then you probably aren't going to like whatever comes next from this franchise. And it IS a franchise.Please check out the comic/graphic novel related to this series if you want the story to be explained further. Questions like what happened in that 28 days before Jim woke up are answered. Who would make something like ""Rage"" and WHY for God'sake would they try to make it anyway. Was there anyone else working on the ""Rage"" project. What happened to the monkeys. Why don't ""the infected"" just tear each other apart, seems like a vicious circle if that were the case; infected 1 sees infected 2 they fight wounding each other mortally and die in the lab, end of story. Where did the jet Jim sees and at the end of the film come from? How did anyone survive the initial outbreak of ""Rage"", I mean if it's just on the U K Island, the military nukes the island; saving coutless lives at the cost of several thousands.Oh, I'm sorry was I raving, to quote a great line from Exorcist 3.Watch the movie, the first 6 minutes of the movie are absolutely incredible!!!! The moment when John decides who he is saving in the upstairs room ... the guy should win an award just for that one single moment when you see the look on his face and know he has to figure out in nanoseconds what is most important to him in life ... it makes me shiver and say ""by the grace of God go I"".

1090994,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000TJBN7Q,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[1, 2]","28 Weeks Later boasts a fantastically intense opening sequence, and with it a promise of a relentlessly paced thriller. And director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo delivers exactly that. Outdoing the intensity (and certainly the gore) of its predecessor, the sequel retains much of the jumpy scares and all of the terrifying zombies, but focuses more on visceral action and horrifying violence, and brings a welcome unpredictability to its frenzied survival story. 28 Days Later you may fear those corrupted by chaos. 28 Weeks Later you will fear those infected by Rage.Twenty-eight weeks after the initial Rage Virus outbreak finds London occupied by the American military and a heavy quarantine in place. Those that survived begin to rebuild their world in seclusion, and after several months of no sign of the virus and all those originally infected dead to starvation, hopeful tranquility appears to return. But such serenity was not meant to last, and when a father with a dark past is reunited with his children, tragic events unfold that rapidly lead to another outbreak of the Rage. Once again an epidemic of voracious zombies threatens London, and those trapped between the ruthless military and their drastic precautions will find little solace amongst the carnivorous abominations that roam the streets.When 28 Days Later premiered, horror fans the world over praised it for its new breed of zombie with a familiar penchant for human flesh, but also a new, extremely aggressive and violent temperament. Combined with an enhanced agility and speed, Danny Boyle's unique twist on the undead fiend became far more terrifying than Romero's original design. While Days used his vicious creatures almost as a backdrop for the more diabolical workings of his corrupted military, Weeks takes full advantage of these cannibalistic crazies to produce some truly shocking horror scenes. The opening sequence perfectly outlines just how deadly the infected are as they overwhelm the small group of survivors and dispatch them in a quick and brutal fashion. From there each encounter becomes even more panic-inducing as Fresnadillo utilizes several ingenious tension-building devices, from the shaky handheld cameras to the foreboding music. One standout scene finds the protagonists in a pitch-black subway station with the only light source being a sniper rifle night-vision scope. In a wonderfully chaotic moment all hell breaks loose and we are witness to a riveting fight for survival where we feel as helpless as our heroes thanks to Enrique Chediak's camerawork and the frantic editing.With the increased zombie screen time comes a far higher level of blood and gore and both are handled well to enhance the gravity of the survivors' plight. Throats are torn, eyes are gouged, and heads explode to reveal a sadistic amount of bloodletting that will have gorehounds cheering and the squeamish fleeing. Partway through the film a helicopter decapitation reminiscent of Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror can be found, but here it's no longer an over-the-top splatter of body parts, but rather an exercise in some truly horrific bloodshed.Though different in focus from its predecessor, 28 Weeks Later builds upon Boyle's original concept to create a terrifyingly appropriate sequel that carries on a series of horror films that redefines the zombie. No more are the shambling, brainless denizens of the night - here the undead possess an unparalleled speed and ferocity that only the most heavily armed (and fortunate) can hope to escape. Arguably superior to the original, 28 Weeks Later is a triumphant return to a remarkably frightening world lost to both those in power and those immune to it, where death can descend upon you in the blink of a bloody eye - if you're one of the lucky ones.- Joel Massie",4,28 Weeks Later Movie Review,1191801600,"10 8, 2007",2007,3801,"['28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'fantastically', 'intense', 'opening', 'sequence', 'promise', 'relentlessly', 'paced', 'thriller', 'director', 'Juan', 'Carlos', 'Fresnadillo', 'delivers', 'exactly', 'Outdoing', 'intensity', 'certainly', 'gore', 'predecessor', 'sequel', 'much', 'jumpy', 'scares', 'terrifying', 'zombies', 'more', 'visceral', 'action', 'horrifying', 'violence', 'welcome', 'unpredictability', 'frenzied', 'survival', 'story', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'may', 'fear', 'corrupted', 'chaos', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'will', 'fear', 'infected', 'Rage.Twenty-eight', 'weeks', 'initial', 'Rage', 'Virus', 'outbreak', 'London', 'occupied', 'American', 'military', 'heavy', 'quarantine', 'place', 'survived', 'begin', 'rebuild', 'world', 'seclusion', 'several', 'months', 'sign', 'virus', 'originally', 'infected', 'dead', 'starvation', 'hopeful', 'tranquility', 'return', 'such', 'serenity', 'was', 'not', 'meant', 'last', 'when', 'father', 'dark', 'past', 'reunited', 'children', 'tragic', 'events', 'unfold', 'rapidly', 'lead', 'outbreak', 'Rage', 'Once', 'again', 'epidemic', 'voracious', 'zombies', 'London', 'trapped', 'ruthless', 'military', 'drastic', 'precautions', 'will', 'find', 'little', 'solace', 'carnivorous', 'abominations', 'roam', 'streets.When', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'premiered', 'horror', 'fans', 'world', 'praised', 'new', 'breed', 'zombie', 'familiar', 'penchant', 'human', 'flesh', 'also', 'new', 'extremely', 'aggressive', 'violent', 'temperament', 'Combined', 'enhanced', 'agility', 'speed', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'unique', 'twist', 'undead', 'fiend', 'became', 'far', 'more', 'terrifying', 'Romero', 'original', 'design', 'Days', 'used', 'vicious', 'creatures', 'almost', 'backdrop', 'more', 'diabolical', 'workings', 'corrupted', 'military', 'Weeks', 'full', 'advantage', 'cannibalistic', 'crazies', 'produce', 'truly', 'shocking', 'horror', 'scenes', 'opening', 'sequence', 'perfectly', 'just', 'how', 'deadly', 'infected', 'are', 'overwhelm', 'small', 'group', 'survivors', 'dispatch', 'quick', 'brutal', 'fashion', 'encounter', 'even', 'more', 'panic-inducing', 'Fresnadillo', 'several', 'ingenious', 'tension-building', 'devices', 'shaky', 'handheld', 'cameras', 'foreboding', 'music', 'One', 'standout', 'scene', 'protagonists', 'pitch-black', 'subway', 'station', 'only', 'light', 'source', 'being', 'sniper', 'rifle', 'night-vision', 'scope', 'wonderfully', 'chaotic', 'moment', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'are', 'witness', 'riveting', 'fight', 'survival', 'where', 'feel', 'as', 'helpless', 'heroes', 'thanks', 'Enrique', 'Chediak', 'camerawork', 'frantic', 'editing.With', 'increased', 'zombie', 'screen', 'time', 'far', 'higher', 'level', 'blood', 'gore', 'are', 'handled', 'well', 'enhance', 'gravity', 'survivors', 'plight', 'Throats', 'are', 'torn', 'eyes', 'are', 'gouged', 'heads', 'explode', 'reveal', 'sadistic', 'amount', 'bloodletting', 'will', 'have', 'gorehounds', 'cheering', 'squeamish', 'fleeing', 'Partway', 'film', 'helicopter', 'decapitation', 'reminiscent', 'Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'Planet', 'Terror', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'no', 'longer', 'over-the-top', 'splatter', 'body', 'parts', 'rather', 'exercise', 'truly', 'horrific', 'different', 'focus', 'predecessor', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'Boyle', 'original', 'concept', 'create', 'terrifyingly', 'appropriate', 'sequel', 'series', 'horror', 'films', 'redefines', 'zombie', 'more', 'are', 'shambling', 'brainless', 'denizens', 'night', 'here', 'undead', 'possess', 'unparalleled', 'speed', 'ferocity', 'only', 'most', 'heavily', 'armed', 'fortunate', 'can', 'hope', 'escape', 'Arguably', 'superior', 'original', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'triumphant', 'return', 'remarkably', 'frightening', 'world', 'lost', 'power', 'immune', 'where', 'death', 'can', 'descend', 'blink', 'bloody', 'eye', ""'re"", 'one', 'lucky', 'ones.-', 'Joel', 'Massie']",28 Weeks Later

1090997,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000TJBN7Q,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 6]","In ""28 Days Later"", Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a coma to find a virtually deserted London. He quickly learns the ""Rage Virus"" has swept through the country changing the infected to zombies who hunt for humans to feed on. There are a handful of uninfected people, but their numbers are dwindling fast. He joins up with a group of the survivors and attempts to get out of the city, where the concentrations of diseased are, to the countryside. He and the survivors hope they will be able to wait for help and rescue.Written by Alex Garland and directed by Danny Boyle (""Trainspotting""), ""28 Days Later"" proved to be an example of what could go write in a suspenseful, well-made horror film. The filmmakers realized the key to success in this genre is to give the audience little glimpses of blood and gore and concentrate more heavily on suspense. It worked and ""28 Days Later"" was a cult success.I was worried to learn of the sequel ""28 Weeks Later"". In this day and age of `horror films' depicting the most gruesome acts in vivid, lurid detail, I was afraid ""Weeks"" would fall victim to this. I was even more worried when I learned the sequel would be released by Fox Atomic, the genre picture division of 20th Century Fox, whose most famous release to date has been the remake of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and it's recent sequel. ""Weeks"" seemed destined to be a blood bath and gore fest, losing all the elements of suspense that made the first film work so well.I was pleasantly surprised by ""Weeks"". Surprised in a good way. Director and co-writer Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (""Intacto"", a film I am not familiar with) has kept much of what made ""Days"" work intact. With the lone exception of one scene in which the blood and gore fly with unnecessary abandon, the film is surprisingly suspenseful.""Weeks"" begins a few days after the outbreak. Don (Robert Carlyle) and his wife, Alice (Catherine McCormack) have holed up in a small country house with the two elderly owners and three other survivors. With all of the windows boarded up, they seem to be relatively safe, trying to deal with the shock of recent events as they eke out a living. Then, a little boy bangs on the door and they let him in, just before a hoard of the infected zombies attack the house. Don and Alice make it to the roof, but Alice is soon surrounded. Rather than risk his life, Don runs and manages to escape, turning back to see the look of disbelief on his wife's face just before they descend on her. Six months later, the US Army has secured a small area in the middle of London and are confident they have things under control. So they let some British survivors back, to begin repopulation. Don, in charge of the water and electricity of the area, anxiously awaits his children's return. They were on a school trip when the outbreak started and have spent the last six months in Spain. Tammy (Imogen Poots), 15 or 16, and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton), 8 or 9, run up to their dad, excited to see him after so long. They naturally want to know what happened to mom and Don tells them a slightly different story. Tammy and Andy want to go home, to retrieve some lost possessions, so they sneak off the island and commandeer a motor scooter. Searching through their home, they are surprised to find Alice holed up in the attic. An army doctor, Scarlet (Rose Byrne) runs some tests and realizes Alice is infected with the virus, but is not affected by it; she is a host and can transmit the virus through her blood or saliva. Don learns of Alice's return and goes to see her. Then, all hell breaks lose as the Rage Virus starts to infect again. The army attempts to eradicate the virus, but can't control it. Tammy and Andy manage to escape with the help of Scarlet and another soldier, Doyle (Jeremy Renner). Escape is relatively easy, then they have to stay alive.It's a nice touch the film starts during the same timeframe of the original, introducing us to a new set of characters living through a different version of the same horror Jim experienced.Co-written and directed by Fresnadillo, ""Weeks"" takes a while to set-up the environment of the story. As Tammy and Andy arrive at the airport, vacant except for the one plane, they make the journey to the secure area on board the Tube, protected by soldiers, riding past soldiers standing sentry, listening to a soldier tell them about living in the new zone. As the subway car travels along the tracks, we see the evidence of the virus as soldiers remove the bodies from homes, stacking them in the middle of the street for disposal. But the remainder of the area is vacant. No people, no cars, no boats on the Thames, no movement of any kind. Once this is done, the film has established the environment the two kids will be living in and the difficulty they will have moving about, surviving, and making their way to safety. This is a necessary, welcome step in the process of establishing a successful suspense film. If we believe the surroundings, or environment the characters are living in, have to escape, we feel every moment of their journey.How they were able to accomplish the establishing shots of London is beyond me. Street after street is empty of human life. There is no point of the day, except maybe the middle of the night, when any London street has no one or nothing moving along. As the two kids ride the Tube to the protected area, we see street after street, building after building, empty. The city is deserted. The River Thames is vacant.The US Army is presented as a necessary evil at first. Naturally, there are no British soldiers to help with the containment; the virus has wiped all of them out, leading to the establishment of a ""US-led Nato Force"". Led by Stone (Idris Elba, HBO's ""The Wire""), the force is very efficient and very careful to make sure everyone is safe. Some of the soldiers, Flynn (Harold Perinneau, TV's ""Lost""), a chopper pilot, and Doyle (Jeremy Renner) are bored and get up to some antics, but they are going about their duties. Then, when things start to go wrong, they naturally take the most extreme route and try to contain the problem.The film uses a series of techniques to show quick flashes of the action, lingering on most for only a few seconds. There is a lot of handheld camera work, most of the cinematography is almost monochromatic in shades of brown, and the editing is fast and furious. The combination of these techniques help to create a unique look, giving the film a bleak, cinema verite quality which also helps to create suspense. As we never linger on any shot for very long, there are brief moments when the camera reveals a little shot of horror. Will an infected person appear at any moment and attack on of our characters? We never know because our perspective is always shifting.With the lone exception of one scene, the film concentrates more on building suspense than reveling in blood and gore. The majority of the shots revealing blood or violence are just enough to get our mind thinking about it and in many, the blood is black or brown. Horror is always more memorable when our own mind starts to fill in the blanks and connect the dots.This one scene, just before the virus breaks out again, is bloody and gory and excessive. It almost feels as thought Fresnadillo let's his better judgment lapse and lingers on some of the elements of this tableau too long. We get the idea, yet he holds the camera over parts for what is relatively a long, long time.That said, as much as I was grossed out, this same scene almost seems necessary. Because so many of the other shots are fleeting, giving us very brief shots of the horror, we almost need something like this to fuel the flames, to provide material for the future brief shots of people afflicted by the Rage virus featured throughout the film.Yes, there will likely be a ""28 Months Later"". The filmmakers have included a brief scene at the end of the film allowing the story to continue. Hopefully, the next film will be as successful as the first two.",4,"""28 Weeks Later"" Is A Surprise...

1090998,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B000TJBN7Q,Todd Smith,"[1, 3]","In 2002, Director, Danny Boyle re-invented the zombie movie with his groundbreaking film 28 Days Later. Many credit Boyle with the current zombie craze we enjoy eleven years later. What made that film so enjoyable was that at the time it was a story we hadn't seen in a long time and it was shot in a way that made it look like a much older film than it was. Five years later the studio wanted a sequel and Boyle wanted no part of it, knowing that it would never live up to the original and indeed it does not. 28 Weeks Later is a continuation of the story, which claims that all the infected had starved to death and that England is free of infection once again. People start moving back in to areas of the country that have been fixed up for them and which are protected by the U.S. Government. We are then introduced to a family which has been reunited. The film starts out with a tremendous action scene that was the only part of the film I enjoyed and the only part that is reminiscent of the first film. The terrific opening is followed by a long, sappy, family reunion and then by a sick person being found. From that point, literally within ten minutes hundreds of people are infected and the army is shooting everything in sight. How could zombies have starved in the first place, but more importantly how can so many people change, just like that, within ten minutes? It didn't make any sense at all, to make things worse, all dialogue and storyline ends at that point and the movie turns into one big gory chase scene without any substance whatsoever. As for the cast of this film, they did nothing to help the story. In the first film, Cillian Murphy was amazing and carried us through the low points, but here it's a cast of newcomers and unsuccessful character actors, who quickly bring the story to a halt. I was looking forward to seeing this film, but not only doesn't it compare to the first film, but it doesn't even live up to the broad genre it is exposing us to. The cast was sloppy, the direction was confusing, and worst of all it just doesn't make any sense! 28 Days Later was groundbreaking, but it's sequel is nothing more than an over-hyped movie that never should have been made.",2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]  - @tss5078,1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,2208,"['2002', 'Director', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 're-invented', 'zombie', 'movie', 'groundbreaking', 'film', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'Many', 'credit', 'Boyle', 'current', 'zombie', 'craze', 'enjoy', 'eleven', 'years', 'later', 'What', 'made', 'film', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'time', 'was', 'story', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'shot', 'way', 'made', 'look', 'much', 'older', 'film', 'was', 'Five', 'years', 'later', 'studio', 'wanted', 'sequel', 'Boyle', 'wanted', 'part', 'knowing', 'would', 'never', 'live', 'up', 'original', 'indeed', 'not', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'continuation', 'story', 'infected', 'had', 'starved', 'death', 'England', 'free', 'infection', 'once', 'again', 'People', 'start', 'moving', 'back', 'areas', 'country', 'have', 'been', 'fixed', 'up', 'are', 'protected', 'U.S.', 'Government', 'are', 'then', 'introduced', 'family', 'been', 'reunited', 'film', 'out', 'tremendous', 'action', 'scene', 'was', 'only', 'part', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'only', 'part', 'reminiscent', 'first', 'film', 'terrific', 'opening', 'followed', 'long', 'sappy', 'family', 'reunion', 'then', 'sick', 'person', 'being', 'found', 'point', 'literally', 'ten', 'minutes', 'hundreds', 'people', 'are', 'infected', 'army', 'shooting', 'everything', 'sight', 'How', 'could', 'zombies', 'have', 'starved', 'first', 'place', 'more', 'importantly', 'how', 'can', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'change', 'just', 'ten', 'minutes', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'make', 'things', 'worse', 'dialogue', 'storyline', 'ends', 'point', 'movie', 'one', 'big', 'gory', 'chase', 'scene', 'substance', 'whatsoever', 'cast', 'film', 'did', 'nothing', 'help', 'story', 'first', 'film', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'was', 'amazing', 'carried', 'low', 'points', 'here', 'cast', 'newcomers', 'unsuccessful', 'character', 'actors', 'who', 'quickly', 'bring', 'story', 'halt', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'film', 'not', 'only', ""n't"", 'compare', 'first', 'film', ""n't"", 'even', 'live', 'up', 'broad', 'genre', 'exposing', 'cast', 'was', 'sloppy', 'direction', 'was', 'confusing', 'worst', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'sequel', 'nothing', 'more', 'over-hyped', 'movie', 'never', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made']",28 Weeks Later

1091000,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B000TJBN7Q,trashcanman,"[120, 142]","When I heard that this was coming out, I was not expecting much. The original is arguably THE zombie classic (discounting the hysterical ""Shaun of the Dead"") of the last decade, but the sequel involved almost none of the original minds that brought us the stark terror of ""28 Days Later"", which combined the threats of cataclysmic disease and it's deadly effects on the mind which caused those infected by what became known as the ""Rage Virus"" to viciously and relentlessly attack the uninfected, either killing the victim or spreading the disease.  A sequel had potential of course, but it seemed like it would be a by-the-books popcorn affair. Boy, was I wrong.People complained that the first film started too slowly and was boring for the first twenty minutes; I disagree, but that issue has been addressed nonetheless. The opening sequence flashes back to another group of survivors during the original outbreak.  Their fate is one you won't forget; it is startling, chaotic, terrifying, dramatic, hopeless, and heartbreaking, all within one fairly short chain of events. That's when I knew this one was going to be everything I wished it would be and it never let me down. This film is epic and personal, gruesome yet tearful, and manages to give you everything you want, even when you had no clue that you wanted it.The evolution of the Rage Virus is a fascinating one in that it manages to outlive the death of all of the infected (from starvation) by exploiting a rare gene that allows some people to be carriers of the virus without succumbing to it's effects. The result: even kissing your wife hello could be the catalyst for a new, deadly outbreak. The story kicks in 28 weeks after the infection dies and the US military is overseeing the repopulation of London; or a district of London to be precise. Every possible step is taken to ensure that the horror that was the infection that wiped Great Britain's population clean off the earth is not repeated. Naturally, the virus finds a way. As the crushing mass of humanity flees from the compromised quarantine and the murderous zombies, there is an amazing scene where the rooftop snipers are frantically trying to distinguish the civilians from the infected as they run down a bottlenecked street. The chaos and hopelessness of the situation are palpable as the camera shows us through a soldier's scope just what he is up against in dramatic fashion.  The way that these situations of large-scale human terror are turned into personal struggles is what makes this movie a stone cold classic in my mind where it otherwise would have been just another great horror film.The cinematography impresses as well.  There are plenty more of those iconic shots of deserted London that bring back memories of the first film and make me wish I lived there so I could appreciate them more.  Another nice touch.  And the final shot of the film, while not unexpected, is one that will chill you to the bone and thrill you at the same time.I've spent significant time trying to think of a horror sequel that surpassed the original so superbly and I honestly can't think of one. The closest would be the original ""Dawn of the Dead"", but I still prefer ""Night of the Living Dead"" to ""Dawn"" so ""28 Weeks Later"" takes it. This is an absolute take-no-prisoners, hard ""R"", work of terror that must be viewed by all professing to be horror fans.",5,The perfect horror sequel,1184803200,"07 19, 2007",2007,3388,"['When', 'heard', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'original', 'arguably', 'THE', 'zombie', 'classic', 'discounting', 'hysterical', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'last', 'decade', 'sequel', 'involved', 'almost', 'none', 'original', 'minds', 'brought', 'stark', 'terror', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'combined', 'threats', 'cataclysmic', 'disease', 'deadly', 'effects', 'mind', 'caused', 'infected', 'what', 'became', 'known', 'Rage', 'Virus', 'viciously', 'relentlessly', 'attack', 'uninfected', 'either', 'killing', 'victim', 'spreading', 'disease', 'sequel', 'had', 'potential', 'course', 'seemed', 'would', 'be', 'by-the-books', 'popcorn', 'affair', 'Boy', 'was', 'wrong.People', 'complained', 'first', 'film', 'started', 'too', 'slowly', 'was', 'boring', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'disagree', 'issue', 'been', 'addressed', 'nonetheless', 'opening', 'sequence', 'flashes', 'back', 'group', 'survivors', 'original', 'outbreak', 'fate', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'startling', 'chaotic', 'terrifying', 'dramatic', 'hopeless', 'heartbreaking', 'one', 'fairly', 'short', 'chain', 'events', 'when', 'knew', 'one', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'everything', 'wished', 'would', 'be', 'never', 'let', 'down', 'film', 'epic', 'personal', 'gruesome', 'yet', 'tearful', 'manages', 'give', 'everything', 'want', 'even', 'when', 'had', 'clue', 'wanted', 'it.The', 'evolution', 'Rage', 'Virus', 'fascinating', 'one', 'outlive', 'death', 'infected', 'starvation', 'exploiting', 'rare', 'gene', 'people', 'be', 'carriers', 'virus', 'succumbing', 'effects', 'result', 'even', 'kissing', 'wife', 'hello', 'could', 'be', 'catalyst', 'new', 'deadly', 'outbreak', 'story', 'kicks', '28', 'weeks', 'infection', 'dies', 'US', 'military', 'overseeing', 'repopulation', 'London', 'district', 'London', 'be', 'precise', 'possible', 'step', 'taken', 'ensure', 'horror', 'was', 'infection', 'wiped', 'Great', 'Britain', 'population', 'clean', 'earth', 'not', 'repeated', 'Naturally', 'virus', 'way', 'crushing', 'mass', 'humanity', 'flees', 'compromised', 'quarantine', 'murderous', 'zombies', 'amazing', 'scene', 'where', 'rooftop', 'snipers', 'are', 'frantically', 'trying', 'distinguish', 'civilians', 'infected', 'run', 'down', 'bottlenecked', 'street', 'chaos', 'hopelessness', 'situation', 'are', 'palpable', 'camera', 'soldier', 'scope', 'just', 'what', 'up', 'dramatic', 'fashion', 'way', 'situations', 'large-scale', 'human', 'terror', 'are', 'turned', 'personal', 'struggles', 'what', 'movie', 'stone', 'cold', 'classic', 'mind', 'where', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'great', 'horror', 'film.The', 'cinematography', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'plenty', 'more', 'iconic', 'shots', 'deserted', 'London', 'bring', 'back', 'memories', 'first', 'film', 'make', 'wish', 'lived', 'so', 'could', 'appreciate', 'more', 'nice', 'touch', 'final', 'shot', 'film', 'not', 'unexpected', 'one', 'will', 'chill', 'bone', 'thrill', 'same', 'time.I', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'significant', 'time', 'trying', 'think', 'horror', 'sequel', 'surpassed', 'original', 'superbly', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'closest', 'would', 'be', 'original', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'still', 'prefer', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Dawn', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'absolute', 'take-no-prisoners', 'hard', 'R', 'work', 'terror', 'must', 'be', 'viewed', 'professing', 'be', 'horror', 'fans']",28 Weeks Later

Though the basic rules of the film's world - zombies running wild, for example - are the same, the sequel has more actions including shootings, explosions and zombie attacks. The film has many plot holes and shaky camera works (and very shaky at time), but it is entertaining nonetheless.After the film's intense opening chapters, ""28 Weeks Later"" shows us the deserted city of London, where a certain area is now a secure zone for the military and residents. Selected civilians are allowed to return to England and they are informed (by the US army) that the disease is now contained. Of course it is, until someone, or some people, does things that they should not do.Robert Carlyle and Catherine McCormack appear (and they are both very good), but their screen time is comparatively limited. The real stars are no doubt the undead. The zombie attacks have become more fierce and gory this time.The action-packed sequel is helmed by Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, whose unique thriller ""Intacto"" impressed me with its original story. Unfortunately, despite its merits (like terrific opening, impressive shots of the city's landmarks, etc.), ""28 Weeks Later"" sometime needs better plot devices than what they offer to convince us. I know we should forget such questions as ""How can he or she do this or that?"" while watching films - any films - but I think ""28 Weeks Later"" demands too much.Or perhaps I didn't like these two kids, whose actions play an important role in the plot. Here is a new perspective Juan Carlos Fresnadillo has introduced into the overcrowding genre of zombie films. What you do for love does not necessarily mean a good thing. Well, that is the only way I can think of to account for their presence. Or perhaps the script is not that deep and that new viewpoint is just accidental. I don't know.

Instead, the film revolves around new characters living in England in the aftermath of death and destruction caused by the Rage virus.The picture begins during the time period of 28 DAYS LATER with a group of unaffected citizens attempting to survive in the English countryside until those infected with the virus die out. It looks like they will make it until the cottage they are staying in is attacked by a horde of zombies. A small battle ensues, but the survivals are outnumbered. Some of the survivors, including Donald Harris (Robert Carlyle) and his wife Alice (Catherine McCormick) try to make it to the escape route, a boat on the river. Things go terribly wrong and Catherine is attacked and bitten by the creatures. Thinking only of himself, Donald leaves his wife behind and succeeds in escaping down the river.The movie then fast forwards seven months after the initial outbreak. The virus was contained and didn't escape the country of England. Those infected died within a few weeks. With the help of the United States military, the country is in the very initial stages of rebuilding while scientists attempt to develop an anti-virus should an outbreak of the Rage occur again. Donald meets his children who had been staying overseas in the U.S. and they attempt to rebuild their lives. The Harris children soon find themselves feeling like prisoners and unable to understand why they can't return to their old home since the virus is now contained. They sneak through the safety barrier and return to their old home. There they discover that their mother is still alive. It is later discovered that though she has not been affected by the virus, she is carrying it in her blood. With Mrs. Harris discovery, there is hope that an anti-virus might be developed from her blood. However, no one suspects how far love and guilt can push a person and London soon finds itself in the middle of another outbreak.As far as sequels go, especially a zombie movie sequel, 28 WEEKS LATER is especially well done. Starting with the prologue that introduces some of the main characters and ties this film to the events from the original, 28 WEEKS LATER does an excellent job of remaining true to the mood and tone of 28 DAYS LATER, yet, sets up a completely different story that stands strong on its own. A person doesn't need to see 28 DAYS LATER to be able to enjoy 28 WEEKS LATER.Personally, I was initially reluctant to see 28 WEEKS LATER because it wasn't directed by Danny Boyle (though he did direct some of the second unit filming). But after hearing positive remarks about the movie from close friends, I'm glad I saw the picture.Recommended for anyone who has seen 28 DAYS LATER and people who like zombie movies.",4,Return of the Rage,1191542400,"10 5, 2007",2007,2949,"['Taking', 'play', 'George', 'Romero', 'zombie-movie', 'book', '28', 'WEEKS', 'LATER', 'sequel', '2002', 'successful', 'zombie', 'picture', '28', 'DAYS', 'LATER', 'directed', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'none', 'original', 'characters', 'original', 'picture', 'Instead', 'film', 'around', 'new', 'characters', 'living', 'England', 'aftermath', 'death', 'destruction', 'caused', 'Rage', 'virus.The', 'picture', 'time', 'period', '28', 'DAYS', 'LATER', 'group', 'unaffected', 'citizens', 'attempting', 'survive', 'English', 'countryside', 'infected', 'virus', 'out', 'will', 'make', 'cottage', 'are', 'staying', 'attacked', 'horde', 'zombies', 'small', 'battle', 'ensues', 'survivals', 'are', 'outnumbered', 'survivors', 'including', 'Donald', 'Harris', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'wife', 'Alice', 'Catherine', 'McCormick', 'try', 'make', 'escape', 'route', 'boat', 'river', 'Things', 'go', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'Catherine', 'attacked', 'bitten', 'creatures', 'Thinking', 'only', 'Donald', 'wife', 'escaping', 'down', 'river.The', 'movie', 'then', 'fast', 'forwards', 'seven', 'months', 'initial', 'outbreak', 'virus', 'was', 'contained', 'did', ""n't"", 'escape', 'country', 'England', 'infected', 'died', 'few', 'weeks', 'help', 'United', 'States', 'military', 'country', 'very', 'initial', 'stages', 'rebuilding', 'scientists', 'attempt', 'develop', 'anti-virus', 'should', 'outbreak', 'Rage', 'occur', 'again', 'Donald', 'children', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'staying', 'overseas', 'U.S.', 'attempt', 'rebuild', 'lives', 'Harris', 'children', 'soon', 'find', 'feeling', 'prisoners', 'unable', 'understand', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'return', 'old', 'home', 'virus', 'now', 'contained', 'sneak', 'safety', 'barrier', 'return', 'old', 'home', 'discover', 'mother', 'still', 'alive', 'later', 'discovered', 'not', 'been', 'affected', 'virus', 'carrying', 'blood', 'Mrs.', 'Harris', 'discovery', 'hope', 'anti-virus', 'might', 'be', 'developed', 'blood', 'However', 'one', 'how', 'far', 'love', 'guilt', 'can', 'push', 'person', 'London', 'soon', 'middle', 'outbreak.As', 'far', 'sequels', 'go', 'especially', 'zombie', 'movie', 'sequel', '28', 'WEEKS', 'LATER', 'especially', 'well', 'done', 'Starting', 'prologue', 'main', 'characters', 'ties', 'film', 'events', 'original', '28', 'WEEKS', 'LATER', 'excellent', 'job', 'remaining', 'true', 'mood', 'tone', '28', 'DAYS', 'LATER', 'yet', 'up', 'completely', 'different', 'story', 'strong', 'own', 'person', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', '28', 'DAYS', 'LATER', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', '28', 'WEEKS', 'LATER.Personally', 'was', 'initially', 'reluctant', 'see', '28', 'WEEKS', 'LATER', 'was', ""n't"", 'directed', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'did', 'direct', 'second', 'unit', 'filming', 'hearing', 'positive', 'remarks', 'movie', 'close', 'friends', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saw', 'picture.Recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', '28', 'DAYS', 'LATER', 'people', 'who', 'zombie', 'movies']",28 Weeks Later
1091004,AWRGM17GTMND8,B000TJBN7Q,"Tyler S. ""Super-Review""","[0, 1]","28 Weeks Later does a few things.  It does justice to the first film, it excells in style and cinematography, and it compells with brilliant storytelling.  What 28 Weeks Later failed to do was give us truly memorable scenes and action bits worth playing over again.  While I feel that the film is much better than most horror sequels these days, I wanted so much more out of this film that displayed so much potential.Like I said, the film looks amazing.  The cinematography and lighting are remarkable.  I hate all these pictures these days that involve too many close-ups.  This movie took everything wide and beautiful.  It's remarkable for its look.  That being the most significant thing about the film, the second most would be the story.  I enjoyed how it felt original and mysterious.  The family's story was effective and the writer inserted no cliche's.  Also, the performances were great.  Seeing Jeremy Renner pre-Hurt Locker was great.The few problems I have with the movie do not ruin it, but rather just make the film less memorable.  Aside from some shots of the infected father, there's nothing about this movie that I look back and think ""That was awesome.""  28 Days Later had a few good ""wow"" points that I can recall off the top of my head.  The major problem with this film, is that there is no scene that I instantly remember and engage with.  I loved the baseball bat scene of 28 days later and its following ending fight sequence.  Really the only thing that was really cool about this one was the ""sniper-bait"" scene with the kid and Jeremey Renner.  The helicopter scene was underdone, in my opinion.  My only other problem was its sound editing.  The first scene was WAY TOO QUIET!!!!As well as some others.Other than the fact that 28 Weeks Later is somewhat unexciting, the story and style are equally as beautiful.  It's a blast to look at.  The only thing I would have asked for was a stronger element of action.  Certain horror films, such as the recent Hills Have Eyes, are amazing for they're intense fight scenes.

1091005,A2IU2BSVWQLKJ7,B000TJBN7Q,Unlucky Frank,"[0, 2]","Having panned the unhorrific 28 DAYS LATER, I don't know what possessed me to record this sequel on my DVR and watch it. But, I'm glad that I did. I thought the original was a dull character driven rip-off of George Romero's Horror Classic DAY OF THE DEAD with almost NO horror to be seen anywhere up on the screen.I'm thrilled to say that this Post Apocalyptic Spin-off literally trounces 28 DAYS LATER in terms of doomsday atmosphere, suspense, frights, and gory thrills. There are moments in this film that had me jumping off my couch. Not an easy task to accomplish. Excellent job.MINOR SPOILER: Suffice it to say, there are minor quibbles with the plot. These kind of films are never perfect in suspending disbelief. I won't go into the plot of this ""stand alone"" story. (Read other reviews for that, this is for those that saw the film.) But, I was eagerly anticipating a bloody ignominious end to some of the protagonists in this film. Usually, any character that causes untold pain and suffering upon the rest of the cast is dispatched in due course in a horror film. I don't know if the filmmakers purposely had me wishing for their demise or it was entirely a ""happy accident"" (an unintended accident that helps a film). It certainly made sympathy for the protagonists more precarious.Even though the ending didn't hand me the desired result, any horror film that frightens me, and gets me THAT worked up over the circumstances of its lead characters gets my FIVE STAR rating every time.Some of the images of horror, desolation, and devastation are some of the best I've ever seen in this genre and stayed with me long after my initial viewing. TERRIFIC! Kudos to the Special Effects team and the director, Fresnadillo. Along with Rodriguez' superbly comic PLANET TERROR, Latino directors seem to be making the best films in this genre at the moment. I hope that they become a serious voice in Horror like their Italian cousins. Here's to more great Horror films, guys. I'm impressed.I may have loathed the first film, but I'm a serious FAN of this sequel. The blurb on the box is absolutely wrong. It's MUCH MUCH ""better than the original."" By a bloody mile!This is a FUN, FRIGHTENING, and SUSPENSEFUL HORROR CLASSIC! And a much better addition to the genre than its lackluster mother. I hope this series takes us further to the VERY EDGE of Survival Horror, much like The RESIDENT EVIL series is doing.

1091007,A5X1B2HBQUR3P,B000TJBN7Q,"Vikram Ramanathan ""Live to Learn""","[0, 0]","I Liked this one as much or even more than 28 days. The movie here focuses on the aftermath of the rage virus, pikcing up the pieces where 28 days left of. The movie starts 28 Weeks later when around 1000 odd english citizens are allowed to return back to London but they are confined to stay in a military guarded and protected block of the city called sector 1. The story develops as one of the infected from outside the sector is brought into the sector as the subject does not show sypmtoms of rage virus but it is later found that the subject is immune to the virus but is neverthless a carrier of the virus. Unlike the previous one by Danny Boyle which aimed at more of a cult clasic or film noir style and pretty much focused on 5 characters against an army of zombies, this one is more centered on the emass infection of people  and we also get to see the role of the army as a overseeing body which protects the people and also kills those very people without compassion following strict military orders when there is a chance that they have been infected. The zombies are portrayed with greater movement and agility and ferociousness than in 28 days.There is also more blood and gore. The direction is spot on keeping the tempo up and the tension pulsating. The Soundtrack follows the same grunge metal theme which acts as the coda for the diseased and hopeless london.The movie sustains interest because it paints this grand canvas of large scale infection seen and experienced through the eyes of a family. Robert Carlyle is the father of this family and it is about him and his two daughters and his wife and what happens to them along the way.  I won't give away more than that. The spanish director of this film is really good and this is his first movie in the English language. This guy is going to make a lot of good movies. He is that good.

This sequel is quite good at avoiding the cliches that dog most films of this type and the writer/director avoids rehashing the first film taking an original story related to the first and exploring the aftermath of the viral outbreak. The director uses many of the same techniques that director Danny Boyle used on the first to create a vibe of immediacy and reality in the action that we see and expands on this creating a sense of quiet dread.The film follows two children who are returned to a ""safe haven"" community established by the military in London. It seems that one of the children (Mackintosh Muggleton and Imogen Poots) may have some sort of genetic immunity to the virus which interests of a military scientist (Rose Byrne also in Boyle's ""Sunshine""). Their father (Robert Carlyle)survived but their mother may still be out there with the infected. When the children disappear outside the city's safe area to look for their mother they risk infection and death prompting the military to look for the children.We get a commentary track from the director and producer. Deleted scenes with commentary by the director, an animated short that acts as a prequel to ""28 Days Later"" and one that acts as a bridge between that film and the sequel as well as a multi-part featurette on the making of the film.Fox has done a nice job with the extras. The screener I received suffers from digital compression problems but I suspect Fox will solve those before the finished product hits the street on 10/8 (edit: 10/13as a follow up--the final DVD version released looks just fine).Let's be honest here if you watched the first film and didn't like it or thought it was no big deal chances are you won't enjoy the second film. ""28 Weeks Later"" doesn't just try to replicate the first film but expand on its story in a meaningful way. The filmmakers are pretty successful in what they try and accomplish with this imaginative sequel. It's not a radical departure nor is it a rehash of the first film. Fans who enjoyed the first film will enjoy ""28 Weeks Later"" although the characters aren't quite as well drawn as in the original film.Both this film 28 Weeks Later [Blu-ray]and 28 Days Later [Blu-ray]are available in the Blu-ray high definition format as well with similar features.

The movie is intelligent, but doesn't explore as many themes as 28Days. No existential dialogs on the meaning of life! Deeper themes are explored through the perfect or near perfect casting of the main characters. --in fact I can't think of a movie of this type where the characters have been better cast than this. Very cool faces here--and the director is able to ""say"" a lot through them. The sets are also very well done. And, when it comes to atmosphere the movie is as good as classic Ridley Scott. Also, we dont' have any of the cheap moralizing that makes most of Romero's films so tedious. The audience is left to make up its own mind--which is how it should be.I give the movie four stars because--again--the ending isn't especially satisfactory; and things become rather formulaic towards the end. Setting up a ""third"" movie in the series at the end cheapens things.While this may be a stretch, part of the reason these films have become so popular is that they reflect the current climate of terror associated with ongoing conflict with the middle east.

1091012,A3OND36Q71G76D,B000TJBN7Q,W. Scott Heitman,"[2, 4]","In order to review Weeks Later, it's necessary to say something about Days:This first leg of the franchise managed to transcend the genre by putting characters at the forefront and weaving poignant moments and themes through an unpredictable narrative.  Sure, it was a zombie movie, but it wasn't JUST a zombie movie.Days also managed to function as a well-oiled piece of science fiction.  It established the rules regarding the ""rage virus"" and then set our protagonists free to work against it.Simply put, 28 Days Later is not only a classic of the horror genre, but one of the best dramas I've ever seen.So where does Weeks stand?  Separated from its forebear, Weeks is a more than competent zombie thriller.  It features some truly beautiful cinematography in spots (though there's a good deal of the ever-popular ""shaky camera"" work to bring the film down in this category).  The action is also quite good in spots- there's a kill scene about 2/3 of the way through that won't be soon forgotten.Viewed as a sequel to 28 Days Later, Weeks is all over the place.  It needs to be said that the first 30 minutes made me feel like I was watching a true successor to Days.  Somehow, the intimacy of strangers so well captured in Days had been resurrected.Unfortunately, the rest of the film doesn't hold up as well.  By the halfway point, the plot has degenerated into the genre standards.  It executes them well, But the movie no longer feels like Days- no matter how much the score claims otherwise.On a particularly disturbing note, the film breaks continuity with Days regarding the contagious nature of the virus.  People get splattered with zombie blood and walk away no different than before.  As someone who hopes Boyle returns to direct the inevitable third movie, this change bother me most of all.Weeks still struck me as the second best zombie movie I've ever seen.  The action is tight, the sights are breathtaking, and the plotting is fast enough to account for deficiencies in depth.
