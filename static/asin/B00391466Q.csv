1333369,A1YJ2M23KYI2X7,B00391466Q,"Hernando DeSoto ""Hernando""","[0, 0]","I love the 1956 version of THE BAD SEED. It's a great creepy story brought to life with great performances by Nancy Kelly, Patty McCormack and Eileen Heckert, all Oscar-nominated along with Evelyn Varden and Henry Jones who also give Oscar Caliber performances. This version, made for TV, is lifeless in comparison. I have always liked Blair Brown and Lynn Redgrave but the script lets them down. Here, Lynn is not a kindly widowed busybody as in the original but a rather hep married lady. In the earlier version, Emory was her brother. Here, he's her husband, (played excellently by David Ogden Steirs). Mister Penmark, played by William Hopper in the original has been winnowed out and Christine is now a widow, eliminating all the family dynamic. The handyman here is played by David Carradine and he does a nice job but I always felt that this character as played in the original by Henry Jones was, potentially, a child molestor. There was something about the look in his eyes that was chilling. You don't get that here. Worst of all, alll that is left of Mrs. Daigle's performance is one exterior scene. The original by Eileen Heckart earned her an Oscar nod and it is a wonder to behold. You can skip this. Buy the original.",3,Needs Miracle-Gro,1403740800,"06 26, 2014",2014,1232,"['love', '1956', 'version', 'THE', 'BAD', 'SEED', 'great', 'creepy', 'story', 'brought', 'life', 'great', 'performances', 'Nancy', 'Kelly', 'Patty', 'McCormack', 'Eileen', 'Heckert', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Evelyn', 'Varden', 'Henry', 'Jones', 'who', 'also', 'give', 'Oscar', 'Caliber', 'performances', 'version', 'made', 'TV', 'lifeless', 'comparison', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'Blair', 'Brown', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'script', 'down', 'Here', 'Lynn', 'not', 'kindly', 'widowed', 'busybody', 'original', 'rather', 'hep', 'married', 'lady', 'earlier', 'version', 'Emory', 'was', 'brother', 'Here', 'husband', 'played', 'excellently', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Steirs', 'Mister', 'Penmark', 'played', 'William', 'Hopper', 'original', 'been', 'winnowed', 'out', 'Christine', 'now', 'widow', 'eliminating', 'family', 'dynamic', 'handyman', 'here', 'played', 'David', 'Carradine', 'nice', 'job', 'always', 'felt', 'character', 'played', 'original', 'Henry', 'Jones', 'was', 'potentially', 'child', 'molestor', 'was', 'something', 'look', 'eyes', 'was', 'chilling', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'here', 'Worst', 'alll', 'left', 'Mrs.', 'Daigle', 'performance', 'one', 'exterior', 'scene', 'original', 'Eileen', 'Heckart', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'wonder', 'behold', 'can', 'skip', 'Buy', 'original']",N/A

1333371,AUFK6UT2DU87H,B00391466Q,"Meredith L. Burton ""Bookworm""","[9, 12]","I admittedly had misgivings about buying this DVD, but those doubts were dispelled.  ""The Bad Seed"" is a suspenseful, riveting story that explores the theme of evil and the dilemma of a mother torn between love and revulsion.Christine Penmark is a typical mother who strives to raise her young daughter, Rachel, in an environment of love.  Rachel is beautiful, sweet, and smart.  However, her kind-seeming exterior masks a coldblooded heart.  Christine discovers, to her horror, that her daughter is a ruthless psychopath.Many people neglect this movie version in favor of the one starring Patty Maacormack and Nancy Kelly.  Both versions are wonderful in their own ways.  I appreciate this TVM version because the acting is not overly dramatic.  Rachel is portrayed wonderfully by Carey Wells, a young girl whose soft voice is chilling as she threatens the character of Leroy, (m  Lynne Redgrave is fantastic as the Penmark's landlady, Monica Breedlove, and Blair Brown brings warmth and heartbreaking empathy to the role of Christine.  Give this gripping psychological thriller a chance.  God bless you all.(Please check out my fantasy novel, Crimilia, now available on this site.  Thank you).",5,Chilling: Evil Comes in Many Disguises,1306195200,"05 24, 2011",2011,1195,"['admittedly', 'had', 'misgivings', 'buying', 'DVD', 'doubts', 'were', 'dispelled', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'suspenseful', 'riveting', 'story', 'theme', 'evil', 'dilemma', 'mother', 'torn', 'love', 'revulsion.Christine', 'Penmark', 'typical', 'mother', 'who', 'raise', 'young', 'daughter', 'Rachel', 'environment', 'love', 'Rachel', 'beautiful', 'sweet', 'smart', 'However', 'kind-seeming', 'exterior', 'masks', 'coldblooded', 'heart', 'Christine', 'discovers', 'horror', 'daughter', 'ruthless', 'psychopath.Many', 'people', 'neglect', 'movie', 'version', 'favor', 'one', 'starring', 'Patty', 'Maacormack', 'Nancy', 'Kelly', 'versions', 'are', 'wonderful', 'own', 'ways', 'appreciate', 'TVM', 'version', 'acting', 'not', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'Rachel', 'portrayed', 'wonderfully', 'Carey', 'Wells', 'young', 'girl', 'soft', 'voice', 'chilling', 'character', 'Leroy', 'm', 'Lynne', 'Redgrave', 'fantastic', 'Penmark', 'landlady', 'Monica', 'Breedlove', 'Blair', 'Brown', 'warmth', 'heartbreaking', 'empathy', 'role', 'Christine', 'Give', 'gripping', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'chance', 'God', 'Please', 'check', 'out', 'fantasy', 'novel', 'Crimilia', 'now', 'available', 'site', 'Thank']",N/A
