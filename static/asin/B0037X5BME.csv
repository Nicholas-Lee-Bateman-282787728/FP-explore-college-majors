Many of the hummingbirds featured are very, very strange!My favourite is the species living high in the mountains, where the air is too thin for the bird to hover - which doesn't matter, since all flowers are within reach on the ground. Another classic is the hummingbird who nests close to hawks' nests, since hawks love to eat animals that prey on hummingbird nests. And how many people realize that swifts are evolutionary cousins of hummingbirds? The most spectacular part of the documentary shows the mating ritual of the rare spatuletail, endemic to a small region of Peru.That being said, I nevertheless get the impression that this documentary is more about nerdy ornithologists doing research on hummingbirds, than about the birds themselves...But sure, if ""hummers"" are your first love, this might just indulge you.",4,Meet the hummers,1374969600,"07 28, 2013",2013,950,"['Hummingbirds', 'Magic', 'Air', 'four', 'stars', 'quite', 'spectacular', 'footage', 'small', 'jewels', 'avian', 'world', 'Many', 'hummingbirds', 'featured', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'strange', 'favourite', 'species', 'living', 'high', 'mountains', 'where', 'air', 'too', 'thin', 'bird', 'hover', ""n't"", 'matter', 'flowers', 'are', 'reach', 'ground', 'classic', 'hummingbird', 'who', 'close', 'hawks', 'nests', 'hawks', 'love', 'eat', 'animals', 'prey', 'hummingbird', 'nests', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'realize', 'swifts', 'are', 'evolutionary', 'cousins', 'hummingbirds', 'most', 'spectacular', 'part', 'documentary', 'mating', 'ritual', 'rare', 'spatuletail', 'endemic', 'small', 'region', 'Peru.That', 'being', 'said', 'nevertheless', 'get', 'impression', 'documentary', 'more', 'nerdy', 'ornithologists', 'doing', 'research', 'hummingbirds', 'birds', 'sure', 'hummers', 'are', 'first', 'love', 'might', 'just', 'indulge']",Nature: Hummingbirds - Magic in the Air

Murray Abraham-narrated PBS NATURE series (which apparently you can only purchase for the most part by the set:Nature: The Best Of Nature Set (Pandas/Bears/Dogs/Horses/Chimpanzees/Birds)) as an example.Here, with his deliberate, intelligent and calming voice, Abraham describes the miraculous wonder that is the hummingbird, my mother's totem animal and called ""rose-sucker"" or ""flying jewel"" in Spanish.Being in a place where only one species of hummingbird is ever seen, and hardly ever at that, I have loved hummingbirds as much as my mother did. Seeing the awe and wonder that is used here to approach these little darlings just sends me into a state of total happiness. It makes me wonder how many species of hummingbirds we may be killing off now, how many in the near future.Aside from this confection of nature, I am somewhat put out that we can't get more of the individual NATURE episodes.

1329983,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B0037X5BME,Jeffery Mingo,"[9, 15]","If folk like ""March of the Penguins,"" then they should like this work on a different type of bird.  The work says hummingbirds only live in this hemisphere, but they film in diverse locations (the Andes, SF, Louisiana, etc.) to film the 300-plus types.  The work shows scientists studying hummingbirds using new video technology and this shows that we have much more to learn on this species.  At one point, two researchers use a live female hummingbird and a dead one to lure in a male hummingbird.  I understand why they did it?  Perhaps the animals are too smart to be deceived by a dead one.  But could you imagine a living man walking up to a woman in order to flirt and then learning that she's dead!?  For those who love baby animals, the work eventually shows eggs, nests, and hatchlings.  I loved seeing the symbiotic relationship between these birds and flowers, but I was wondering about how man's destruction of such plants and habitats would affect these birds since the start of the work.  The work only mentions endangerment near the end and they focus on an example in which humans are trying to fight the tragedy.  Thus, this work gives a positive spin that perhaps its audience wants to hear.
