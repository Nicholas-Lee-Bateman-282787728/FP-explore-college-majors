But in it's own wacky way, the film manages to circumvent logic (in much the same manner as the epically badShowgirlsdid), and is actually quite entertaining (which the earlier film certainly wasn't!).The credit for the film's success goes equally to Antin's ""Aw, shucks!"" screenplay, which turns 'The Burlesque Club' into a family-friendlyCoyote Uglywith the female bartenders now strippers (who never get close to getting naked), Cher, who takes a small role (forget top billing), and plays the hell out of it (her voice is fabulous, and she looks great, even with puffy lips), and Christina Aguilera, who combines her astonishing singing voice with the youthful enthusiasm of an original cast member ofGlee: The Complete First Season.

1300752,A27W5AJNP6YX7Z,B002ZG976U,,"[0, 0]","I have always been a big fan of Cher. She is one of those rare singers who, when crossing over to the movies, manages to make very high quality movies (although curiously she doesn't often sing in them). Burlesque, despite Cher's top billing, is definitely Christina's movie. I did enjoy the music, but I think I'll skip purchasing the soundtrack seeing how Cher only sang 2 songs.The music was good. The costumes were great. The dancing was good (I may have enjoyed that better if I were a horny guy?). I liked the movie, I really did, but this just wasn't up to the quality of most of the stuff Cher does. And then I have to admit musicals aren't exactly my thing. I like some of the older ones, like Mary Poppins. And don't attack me, but I actually liked Burlesque better than some of the more recent ones like Chicago or Moulin Rouge! (I did enjoy Chicago on Broadway, however.)I guess it was the lack of a plot. Not that that's unusual for a musical.

And, yeah, I know the singing part isn't that far a stretch from Aguilera's wheelhouse. But as a first time actress, she also handles her business. So, take that, Mariah Carey.BURLESQUE doesn't climb the heights of CHICAGO, and the plot is a far cry from innovative. All the tropes and archetypes of a musical are here and you can check them off the list one by one. When Ali (Aguilera) quits her waitressing gig in Iowa and relocates to Los Angeles, the writing is already on the wall. In L.A., she sets foot in the Burlesque Lounge and falls in love with the nightclub and its glamorous disposition. She applies for a job as a dancer and is turned down by Tess, the proprietor of the establishment (Cher). But Ali demonstrates her spunk by picking up a tray and beginning to work the crowd as a waitress. At this stage, we're just counting down the clock until she finds her way to the mic. When she does, it's a pretty spectacular moment.And are you at all surprised to learn that Tess the owner is hanging on to the Burlesque Lounge by her fingernails? Mortgages are a bloody beyotch.The resident witchy diva (because there's always one in these suckers) is played by Kristen Bell, whom I loved as Veronica Mars. Bell's character, Nikki, is the only one who actually sings in the Burlesque Lounge; all the other performers lip synch to their music. Ali arrives at the really revolutionary notion of having the performers actually sing their songs, but she gets turned down flat by Tess. But then Tess hears Ali sing, and so cue the change of heart.There's the expected romance between roommates Aguilera and Cam Gigandet's dreamboat bartender, and these two are sweet together and give the film a chance to occasionally flirt with romantic comedy. You never really get a feeling that that shady real estate developer had a real shot at Ali. The best pairing, though, is Cher and the excellent Stanley Tucci who plays the good-humored back stage director and Tess's right hand man. I wouldn't at all be surprised if these two were improvising in some of their scenes, their chemistry feels that real and organic. Alan Cumming lurks here somewhere, and director Steven Antin remarks that Cumming was intended to be the Mad Hatter in this bit of Wonderland. If Cumming was meant to play the swishy stage presence, well, Tucci stole that thunder. Cumming is wasted in what basically is an extended cameo.The fishnets and feathers and boas are familiar props, but BURLESQUE evades the pitfalls that consumed rank stinkers like GLITTER and SHOWGIRLS. Partly, it's because Cher and Tucci's presence elevates the film. Aesthetically, the film doesn't come off feeling tawdry and cheap (elements which helped kill SHOWGIRLS). There is some risque material presented in the burlesque numbers, but these numbers are fun and tongue-in-cheek. There's a sensuous elegance about the whole thing. Musically, Aguilera and Cher deliver some really electrifying numbers. Cher's introduction comes by way of a fantastic number, ""Welcome to Burlesque,"" which establishes the Burlesque Lounge as a fun place to be in. Later on, she belts out a power ballad (which I didn't like that much), ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me."" She still has those distinctive pipes. And, when Aguilera shares a scene with a nurturing Cher, it does feel a bit like a passing of the torch.Aguilera is in her prime, her flair and big vocals very much on exhibit. The only knock I have is that she maybe should've done this role around a decade ago. But it definitely lends that measure of verisimilitude when the lead actress in a musical does her own singing. If you're only used to Aguilera doing her pop/R&B; thing, you're in for a treat because she sings the hell out of a bunch of old school tunes, inflecting contemporary pizazz in throwback sets such as Mae West's ""Guy What Takes His Time,"" and Etta James' ""Something's Got a Hold on Me"" and the game-changing ""Tough Lover."" My favorite of the lot, though, is probably her playful ""But I Am A Good Girl."" Particularly welcome is the cheeky, brassy Bob Fosse touch infusing these numbers. Even Kristen Bell sexies it up with a steamy rendition of ""Long John Blues."" And, yes, Bell lip-synchs to Megan Mullaly's singing. Still, she ends up delivering - with exquisite shrewness - the movie's best line: ""I will not be upstaged by some slut with mutant lungs!"" You can't tell me that's not an awesome bit of dialogue.The DVD's bonus stuff: Audio Commentary by the writer/first time director Steven Antin; ""The Burlesque Jukebox"" - six full and uncut musical numbers from the film performed by the cast (including Alan Cumming's deleted cover of ""That's Life"" and his racy stage number ""Jungle Berlin""); an alternate opening which has Christina right off belting out ""Something's Got a Hold on Me,"" followed by the rest of that diner scene (00:06:33 minutes long); and a blooper reel (00:05:10).",4,"""Show a little more, show a little

I thought the film and performances were well done.  It's not Moonstruck but it is a love story of many types.  The film was low key and lacked a lot of the stressful tension and excitement I fear lots of younger generations of films goers have grown addicted to, with things flying at you and flashing at you from everywhere.  I was expecting something more intense and tailored to a more adult audience but was pleasantly surprised at how well they presented the rough life of burlesque.  That rough side having been portrayed in older films, though the entertainment still persists today.

Sometimes her performance is a little stiff, but I love the interaction between her and the prop-master at the club.  Someone wrote that they ad-libbed quite a bit and it shows.  Some of the comments are truly off the cuff and fun.  Jack, the bar tender can make my drinks any day!  He is as cute as can be and perfect for Ali (Christina).  For this to be Christina's first film, she did an excellent job.  She had me hooked on the first number she performed at the diner she was working in.  There were a couple of scenes where the acting appeared to be a little forced and overdone.  But this chick can sing.  Her torch song in the Club when she is wearing the green dress really shows her range.  Christina goes from a wide eyed innocent coming to a big city to an experienced performer, in a burlesque lounge, no less.  She knows what she wants and goes after it.  This movie is not for the prudes or real youngsters.  Being a Burlesque show, there is a lot of suggestive clothing (or lack there-of), but no nudity, and &#34;bump and grind&#34;.

1300781,A1RW2BV8B81ESX,B002ZG976U,,"[0, 0]","I watched this the other day and all I can say is it was amazing! The movie tells the story of Alice Marilyn ""Ali"" Rose (played by Christina Aguilera), a small town girl from Iowa, who dreams of a better life as a singer in Los Angles. After getting settled in she hits the town and finds the club known as Burlesque. She enters the club as the co-owner of the club named Tess (played by Cher) sings the club's theme song ""Welcome to Burlesque"". As Alice watches Tess perform she realizes this is the hope she'd been looking for. While at the bar Alice meets and makes friends with the bartender, Jack (played by Cam Gigandet), whom she assumes to be gay due to his outward appearance, who tells her to let Tess know he sent her, so as she goes to pursue this, Tess and her long-time friend, Sean (played by Stanley Tucci) shoot her down and she begins to wait tables, without anyone but Jack's knowledge until Tess catches her and to Alice's luck Jack comes to her rescue claiming he hired her, but Tess knows better but allows it anyway with a warning to ""Never pull that again"". Soon after she starts going under the name Ali. As time goes by Ali watches the dancers and memorizing their routines in her mind. She soon starts to try and press her opinions on Tess to help raise money for the club by allowing the girl dancers to sing live instead of lip-syncing since the audience has seen the acts and the girls do it several times and the routine is running old but Tess, stubborn as she is, refuses to listen and has Ali brushed back to wait tables. Not too long after that Ali returns home to find her apartment broken into, with no where to go or anyone one else to turn to she runs to Jack, who allows her to stay with him until she can find a new place. The next day Ali finds out that Jack is not gay, but that he's engaged and tries to leave but Jack won't let her cause the weather is horrible. The story goes on pretty much the same with the exception that I forgot to mention that Tess' ex-husband, Vincent (played by Peter Gallagher), who is the other co-owner of Burlesque is trying to get Tess' half of the money for the club but soon gives up and starts trying to convince her to let them sell to Marcus (played by Eric Dane), a greedy and money hungry man who will do what every he can to get what he wants. In the end its Ali, who eventually ends up a dancer, who saves Burlesque twice, once by singing live due to Nikki (played by Kristen Bell) trying to sabotage her cause Tess sent Nikki home early due to her being drunk and sent Ali out in her place and once again towards the end of the film.These musical sequences are featured in the film:# ""Something's Got a Hold on Me (Christina Aguilera)"" - Ali# ""Welcome to Burlesque (instrumental)"" - The Burlesque Lounge Girls# ""Welcome to Burlesque (Cher)"" - Tess and the Burlesque Lounge Girls# ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend (Marilyn Monroe & Jane Russel)"" - Nikki, Georgia and the Burlesque Lounge Girls# ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend (outro by Christina Aguilera)"" - Ali# ""Long John Blues (Megan Mullally)"" - Nikki# ""Wagon Wheel Watusi (Elmer Bernstein)"" - Ali# ""Ray of Light (Madonna)"" - Ali and the Burlesque Lounge Girls# ""Tough Lover (Etta James)"" - Ali and two Burlesque Lounge Girls# ""Tough Lover (Christina Aguilera)"" - Ali and two Burlesque Lounge Girls# ""But I Am a Good Girl (Christina Aguilera)"" - Ali# ""Guy What Takes His Time (Christina Aguilera)"" - Ali# ""Express (Christina Aguilera)"" - Ali and the Burlesque Lounge Girls# ""Jungle Berlin (instrumental)"" - Alexis and the contorsionists# ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me (Cher)"" - Tess# ""Bound To You (Christina Aguilera)"" - Ali# ""Show Me How You Burlesque (Christina Aguilera)"" - Ali and the Burlesque Lounge DancersThis movie is great and a must have if you are a fan of Cher's or Christina Aguilera's or even musicals in general.

1300823,A16C1J5AW2CDRE,B002ZG976U,,"[0, 2]","I love musicals and have seen almost every one ever produced both on stage and in film. Watching 'Burlesque' is like watching the TV show 'Glee'. You know that Glee is unrealistic, overdone, and absurd, but , hey, they got these great musical numbers that you would never never see in a real high school show choir. So you watch it anyway because you like the music and you ignore the idiocy of some of the more ridiculous plot lines. However, with Glee, the plot lines are interesting and make sense even if they are overwrought and often unrealistic. They are interesting and Glee at least deals with real and important issues. The same cannot be said for Burlesque.If you are familiar with burlesque as an art form, be prepared to see a version of burlesque that never existed in real life. Not even close. Strip out the comedy, the sexual banter, the skits, and the music and what you have left is numerous numbers of dancing prancing women (and sometimes men) in skimpy costumes behaving like the backup troupe for a Cher concert on an ever expanding and contracting stage in a totally imaginary burlesque theater backed up by a full orchestra.  This is a burlesque theater that you will only see in an ex-burlesque's queen vision of heaven. It is more of a cabaret than a burlesque theater.One of the main plot points of this theater owned by Cher is that it is broke and Cher will lose the place in a couple of weeks to the bank.  You can easily understand why Cher is broke if you think about how much it must have cost to equip the stage, make the costumes and put on the show.Cher has a couple of numbers that she does very well, but you need to get beyond the death mask of a face that she displays that was probably caused by too much plastic surgery and botox.Christina Aquilera is excellent. She sings, she dances, she takes over the film because she can really act. You just have to ignore the stereotypical line that she is just a girl from Iowa. Really?Don't think too hard about the absurdity of the various plot lines that surround the musical numbers. They are dumb and laughable and will ruin the fantasy of this imaginary burlesque theater. For example, much is made of the fact that all the women lip-sync to the music until Aquilera comes along who can really really sing. She belts out the songs and very soon after ALL the performers seem to have magically taking singing lessons.  Then you will laugh yourself silly as you realize that the entire film is lip-synced, all the songs are done in a recording studio and added to the film.Normally this film would deserve a 1-star rating, but I really like musical theater, and despite the terrible nature of this film, I had to give it 3 stars.",3,This is Not Burlesque,1324857600,"12 26, 2011",2011,2717,"['love', 'musicals', 'have', 'seen', 'almost', 'one', 'ever', 'produced', 'stage', 'film', 'Watching', ""'Burlesque"", 'watching', 'TV', 'show', ""'Glee"", 'know', 'Glee', 'unrealistic', 'overdone', 'absurd', 'hey', 'got', 'great', 'musical', 'numbers', 'would', 'never', 'never', 'see', 'real', 'high', 'school', 'show', 'choir', 'watch', 'anyway', 'music', 'ignore', 'idiocy', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'lines', 'However', 'Glee', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'interesting', 'make', 'sense', 'even', 'are', 'overwrought', 'often', 'unrealistic', 'are', 'interesting', 'Glee', 'least', 'deals', 'real', 'important', 'issues', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'Burlesque.If', 'are', 'familiar', 'burlesque', 'art', 'form', 'be', 'prepared', 'see', 'version', 'burlesque', 'never', 'existed', 'real', 'life', 'Not', 'even', 'close', 'Strip', 'comedy', 'sexual', 'banter', 'skits', 'music', 'what', 'have', 'left', 'numerous', 'numbers', 'dancing', 'prancing', 'women', 'sometimes', 'men', 'skimpy', 'costumes', 'behaving', 'backup', 'troupe', 'Cher', 'concert', 'ever', 'expanding', 'contracting', 'stage', 'totally', 'imaginary', 'burlesque', 'theater', 'backed', 'up', 'full', 'orchestra', 'burlesque', 'theater', 'will', 'only', 'see', 'ex-burlesque', 'queen', 'vision', 'heaven', 'more', 'cabaret', 'burlesque', 'theater.One', 'main', 'plot', 'points', 'theater', 'owned', 'Cher', 'broke', 'Cher', 'will', 'lose', 'place', 'couple', 'weeks', 'bank', 'can', 'easily', 'understand', 'why', 'Cher', 'broke', 'think', 'how', 'much', 'must', 'have', 'cost', 'equip', 'stage', 'make', 'costumes', 'put', 'show.Cher', 'couple', 'numbers', 'very', 'well', 'need', 'get', 'death', 'mask', 'face', 'was', 'probably', 'caused', 'too', 'much', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'botox.Christina', 'Aquilera', 'excellent', 'film', 'can', 'really', 'act', 'just', 'have', 'ignore', 'stereotypical', 'line', 'just', 'girl', 'Iowa', 'Really', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'absurdity', 'various', 'plot', 'lines', 'surround', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'dumb', 'laughable', 'will', 'ruin', 'fantasy', 'imaginary', 'burlesque', 'theater', 'example', 'much', 'made', 'fact', 'women', 'lip-sync', 'music', 'Aquilera', 'who', 'can', 'really', 'really', 'sing', 'belts', 'out', 'songs', 'very', 'soon', 'performers', 'seem', 'have', 'magically', 'taking', 'singing', 'lessons', 'Then', 'will', 'laugh', 'silly', 'realize', 'entire', 'film', 'lip-synced', 'songs', 'are', 'done', 'recording', 'studio', 'added', 'film.Normally', 'film', 'would', 'deserve', '1-star', 'rating', 'really', 'musical', 'theater', 'terrible', 'nature', 'film', 'had', 'give', '3', 'stars']",N/A

I did not like the style of music in the film and see it more of a chick flick romance.

I'd reccomend sampling the music before buying; if you like this sort of music, you'd probably like this film--the plot was predictable--I'd figured out the ending in the first 1/2 hour.  I'm more of a fan of old school Broadway musicals like South Pacific and Sound of Music, movies that you left the theater singing the songs.  To me the music in the movie was quite forgettable.

The movie's premise is that we only use a very small percentage of our brains, and the drug gets the body to use 100% of the brain.In the movie, the writer only has a limited supply of the drug with no way to get more. The plot thickens since the drug has side effects and others are after his supply.If I could give half stars, I'd give this movie a 4 1/2. It was very good, and definitely worth seeing, but there have been some movies more deserving of the full 5 stars. Still, this movie has a lot going for it. Here what's good:1. The premise of this movie is unique. It's a great fantasy. Who wouldn't want that level of smarts. He's able to protect himself, make a killing on Wall Street and even impress women by ordering dinner speaking Italian. Just pop a pill and you're able to pretty much conquer the world. Great concept.2. I like movies with smart heroes. This movie has that - well sometimes. The trouble with our hero is that without the drug he's an average guy who's sincere but not all that interesting, smart or even very likable. And when he's on the drug he's almost all about making money and having fun.In the characters favor, he does sincerely love a woman, and he honestly wants to be the better man she needs and deserves. Or at least to appear that way.Regardless of his flaws, the movie pulls you in, and you'll care about Bradley's character. This is usually essential for a movie to be good, and this movie succeeds in that. Cooper does an excellent job portraying the character in all his states.3. This is not a special effects movie, but the cinematography and special effects were really well done. They were a major part of moving the story along, helping you understand what was happening to Bradley Cooper's character, and helping you get inside his head.4. There was some suspense, action and danger that made the story exciting. The fact that the drug was going to run out and had dangerous side effects worked similar to a ticking bomb, always in the back of your mind. The movie kept to a good pace. It was almost always interesting and sometimes exciting. There were interesting plot twists. You don't always know what's coming next.Here's what's not quite as good:1. I wanted to like the lead character even more. I didn't quite identify with him personally. However others might.2. I would have liked the love story to have been more developed. I think it would resulted in pulling the audience into the story in a more intense way.3. Of course De Niro is an amazing actor, however his role was kind of small and not particularly high impact. I don't think the role was a great fit for him.Regardless, I'd definitely recommend this movie. It's exciting and interesting, and I'd watch it again.

Through a series of luck, pluck, and talent she ends up as the big star on the stage. The film has first rate production values and really good acting, the problem is we've seen it all before, several times.The disappointment here is that the acting is darn good. Cher proves why she is called ""Oscar winning actress"" especially in the scenes where she is becoming a mentor to Aguilera. More importantly Aguilera, having gone through a professional stage of wearing so much make up that Japanese Kabuki actors were saying ""chill girl"" is now believable as the wide eyed ing&eacute;nue.The production value and sets are first rate though the songs, delivered by great singers, are pretty forgettable. Cher's opening ""Burlesque"" is obviously supposed to mirror Joel Grey's ""Cabaret""  but lack's that number's memorable hooks, but that is the fault of the writers, not the singers who have and use their considerable talent, as Cher says to Christina at one point ""You told me you could sing. You didn't tell me you could sing like that!""Ultimately all this can't save Burlesque. If you've never seen a film with this story before you know, ""A Star is Born"" ""Coyote Ugly"" ""42nd Street"" ""Show girls"" etc any 1970's sit-com, you'll love it.

You've seen it before and it is all predictable and you know what will happen long before it hits the screen.

I can't hate on this too much because I soaked up every scantily clad moment (what hot blooded male wouldn't?) but I can't in my right mind actually recommend a movie this brainless in construction.  The scene staging is god awful and the acting is atrocious (except from Stanley Tucci, who proves once again to be the ideal supporting man) and that script is a clich&eacute;d mess, but when you throw it all in a pot with some stunning vocals echoing themselves over a trashy cabaret nightclub you kind of (and I mean KIND OF) get cinematic magic.  The plot is predictable (young country girl with big dreams gets sucked into a crazy new life only to have to use her `gifts' to save her dreams from being crushed) and Christina Aguilera is a very bad actress (all sorts of OMG terrible actually), but the music is a total hit and even though Cher looks like a giantess amongst all these stick thin beauties and her solo `You Haven't Seen the Last of Me' is set up in such an awkward and out of place fashion, the song is amazing and she nails the emotional intentions perfectly (I just love Cher, despite her tranny-like voice).  It's a cheap rendition of a thousand films before it (`Chicago', `Showgirls', `Cabaret', `Coyote Ugly', etc.), but sometimes you want a little cheap.  The costumes are sexy and drool-worthy and the actual nightclub itself is the stuff of every man's fantasies, but Alan Cumming's weak attempt to emulate Joel Gray is an embarrassment and should have been cut from the film entirely.

When they are on stage, strutting and singing their stuff, neither Christina Aguilera nor Cher disappoint.  They are terrific.The problems with the film, written and directed by Steven Antin, occur when the actors are not singing or dancing.The screenplay is rather trite and the performances, with the exceptions of Stanley Tucci, as the nightclub's gay, sharp-witted stage manager, and Kristen Bell, as the club's hard-drinking lead dancer, are dull.  Despite the fact that she screwed up the ""Star Spangled Banner,"" Ms. Aguilera should keep her night job.For the record, the story deals with an Ohio girl (Aguilera) who travels to Hollywood to make good as an entertainer.  She maneuvers herself into a waitress job at a hot nightclub, Burlesque, owned by Cher and her ex-husband (Peter Gallagher), which is a stone's throw from being foreclosed upon by the bank.  Soon, Christina has not only become the star of the floor show, but she is also being romanced by a ruthless businessman (Eric Dane), who wants to buy Burlesque, so that he can tear it down and build a high rise condo on the land, as well as her ""best friend,"" a young bartender/wannabe songwriter (Cam Gigandet).Guess which one she winds up with while devising a plan to save the club?Alan Cumming is also, very briefly, in the movie, but his one big number was cut from the theatrical release.

1300839,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG976U,,"[3, 6]","One of the pleasures of watching ""The Princess and the Frog"" a year ago was in knowing that Disney was getting back in touch with their roots. They gave us a traditional hand-drawn animated film, a process they had abandoned after the 2004 release of ""Home on the Range."" It was like witnessing a glorious rebirth, the resurrection of a seemingly lost art form. My hope what that it would once again become custom for animated films to be done by hand. It may be painstaking, but can you deny the beautiful results? The backgrounds. The form of the line. The coloring. The lighting. The mattes. Alas, it wasn't to be; for ""Tangled,"" Disney has once again discarded pencil and paper for a computer screen. They have also released it in 3D, a cinematic beast that cannot be tamed.But please, don't get the wrong idea. ""Tangled"" is not a bad movie at all. It's funny, sweet, and adventurous, and it's strong in character, story, and theme. And like all the good Disney animated films, hand-drawn or otherwise, it puts a refreshingly modern twist on a classic fairy tale, ""Rapunzel"" in this case. It also employs a major talent that ""The Princess and the Frog"" would have greatly benefited from: Composer Alan Menken, who - along with lyricists such as Tim Rice, Stephen Schwartz, and the late Howard Ashman - was a key figure of the Disney Renaissance, having composed such memorable tunes as ""Be Our Guest,"" ""Under the Sea,"" and ""Colors of the Wind."" His ear for melody compliments Disney so well, it's almost a shame it isn't like it was in the Golden Age of Hollywood, when cast and crew were contractually obligated to work for a specific studio.""Tangled"" begins with the story of a golden flower that sprouted when a drop of sunshine fell to Earth. It glowed like fire and possessed magical rejuvenating properties when sung to. A vain old crone named Mother Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) depended on it to continuously restore her youth, and so it remained for several centuries until the Queen of the kingdom fell ill while pregnant; upon drinking an elixir made from that golden flower, not only was the Queen brought back to health, she also gave birth to a daughter with magical golden hair. Gothel, desperate to reclaim her immortal good looks, is forced to kidnap the infant princess, since cutting her hair off robs it of its healing powers. And so the princess was raised as Gothel's own in an isolated tower, where she was conditioned to be fearful of the outside world while her hair continued to grow longer and longer and longer.We meet this princess, the innocent Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore), on the verge of her eighteenth birthday. Although she takes Gothel's lies at face value, she remains curious about an annual event held off in the distant kingdom: The releasing of hundreds of floating lanterns, which Rapunzel has figured out are not stars. Is it a coincidence that this event takes place on her birthday? She would like to find out. Here enters the film's narrator, Flynn Rider (voiced by Zachery Levi), a handsome, smooth-talking bandit who seeks refuge in Rapunzel's tower after robbing the King and the Queen. Upon coming to after being whacked in the head with a frying pan several times, he and Rapunzel strike a deal: If he promises to take her to see the lantern ceremony on her birthday, she promises to return his stolen loot, which she has hidden from him. And so begins Rapunzel's first venture away from home, a journey that will include chases, encounters, escapes, revelations, and yes, even romance.It's traditional for an animated film to feature supporting players that are funnier and more memorable than the protagonists. ""Tangled"" provides us with several such characters, including Rapunzel's pet chameleon, Pascal, and a royal horse named Maximus, who has the nose of dog, the reflexes of a cat, and - when in the presence of Flynn - the personality of a mean older brother. We're also given a number of pub-crawling thugs who secretly harbor sentimental hopes and dreams. One of them, voiced by Brad Garrett, has always wanted to be a concert pianist, despite having a hook for a hand. Inspired by Rapunzel's innocence, they all reveal their desires during the film's best song, a hilarious showstopper called ""I Got a Dream.""""Tangled"" is, in short, a pleasant, entertaining, competent animated film, a decent addition to the Disney animated-feature canon. Even so, I would have preferred to once again watch a traditional cel animated film. Perhaps I'm remember with longing the days of glorious labor-intensive productions like ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" and classics like ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" ""Pinocchio,"" and ""Sleeping Beauty."" Simply looking at these movies is an experience unto themselves. I also think that the film's original title of ""Rapunzel"" would not have altered its success in any way, despite Disney's belief that ""The Princess and the Frog"" lost out on a potential viewership of young boys.

After the movie we were all sitting there, saying, ""That was Kristen Bell?""  The film has her playing Nikki, a dancer with enormous talent and charisma who's hobbled by two nasty problems--megalomania and alcoholism.  Something's a little wonky with the script, which seems to be playing on two time scales at once....  One in which Nikki is roughly the contemporary of Christina Aguilera's character, maybe a bit older (in fact Bell is five months older than Aguilera), and the other in which Nikki was around when together, she and Cher started the burlesque dance palace around which the movie, and their lives, revolve.  I'm sure I wasn't the only one who was scratching his head when the big parking lot scene took place and Nikki started giving Cher (I mean ""Tess"") a guilt trip for preferring the new girl Ali!  That's the part where Cher says, what about all the years I held your hair up out of the toilet bowl while you were vomiting everything but your memories?It almost seems that their memories changed and transformed as the decades passed.

1300841,AK88POC4RCEWE,B002ZG976U,,"[5, 11]","This film is mildly entertaining. Nothing special at all. I find Christina Aguilera could do so much better. Sadly, she lacks the pizzaz for that magic cabaret-style entertainer's character. Learn from Liza Minelli(Cabaret), Catherine-Zeta Jones(Chicago) and even the ice queen herself that is Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge! You got to really give your heart and soul and guts to be a stage entertainer Christina darling. Very shallow character.Cher is just there for the condiments. Stanley Tucci never changes his modus operandi since he is the same tired old gay man in practically every films that requires him to be a gay man. The songs are mediocre. it's entertaining but you feel cheated because you have seen many of the cliches happened in this film. It's not bad but it's not that great either.

1300842,A21VR7M8O55EF6,B002ZG976U,,"[5, 11]","With its title, I hoped to see a movie with some toughness, sleaze, grit.  Sex and violence are appropriate ingredients for the movies, especially those set in bump-and-grind clubs with available, young, and provocative women. You won't find it here.  ""Burlesque"" is a glitzy pop musical starring the rising young singer Christina Aguilera and the aging pop diva, Cher. The movie may be a little naughty in parts and a bit of a tease  -- but so was burlesque after all -- but it is mostly antiseptic and bland.The story is set on Sunset Boulevard as Ali, a 20-something waitress from rural Iowa with a hardscrabble background but an unlikely aura of innocence relocates to Los Angeles in search of excitement and a better life. Ali chances upon a struggling, aging and anachronistic burlesque club jointly owned by a jaded old dancer, Tess, and her former husband. Ali has a drive to succeed and a gravelly belting voice like that of Etta James.  Ali spends some of her evenings alone, reading books about the history of burlesque and preparing for her chance. But in spite of some good moments, the story line is predictable. Ali works herself up to a lead role in the club under what becomes the mentoring of the seemingly hard-minded Tess. The movie is a coming-of-age story as well as Ali and a club bartender, an aspiring pop composer, begin what is for the most part a surprisingly sexless romance.I thought Cher's acting was mostly wooden in her scenes with Tess.  She is better in her own vocal numbers, especially in a soliloquy of a song, ""You haven't seen the last of me"" late in the movie. She also is effective in her scenes with her wisecracking gay assistant (and former lover from long ago) Sean, played by Stanley Tucci. Some of the dance numbers and Aguilar's singing are effective in their way, but they are not sexual and they are little of burlesque. The brief scenes offering cameos of Los Angeles streets and cheap apartments help create an atmosphere. The movie could have used more of them.The movie is an old-fashioned musical. Although modestly entertaining, it is bland and almost utterly wholesome and toothless.  Something more could be made of the subject.3.5 stars.Robin Friedman",3,Burlesque in Hollywood,1290729600,"11 26, 2010",2010,2211,"['title', 'hoped', 'see', 'movie', 'toughness', 'sleaze', 'grit', 'Sex', 'violence', 'are', 'appropriate', 'ingredients', 'movies', 'especially', 'set', 'bump-and-grind', 'clubs', 'available', 'young', 'provocative', 'women', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'Burlesque', 'glitzy', 'pop', 'musical', 'starring', 'rising', 'young', 'singer', 'Christina', 'Aguilera', 'aging', 'pop', 'diva', 'Cher', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'naughty', 'parts', 'bit', 'tease', 'so', 'was', 'burlesque', 'mostly', 'antiseptic', 'bland.The', 'story', 'set', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'Ali', '20-something', 'waitress', 'rural', 'Iowa', 'hardscrabble', 'background', 'unlikely', 'aura', 'innocence', 'relocates', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'search', 'excitement', 'better', 'life', 'Ali', 'struggling', 'aging', 'anachronistic', 'burlesque', 'club', 'jointly', 'owned', 'jaded', 'old', 'dancer', 'Tess', 'former', 'husband', 'Ali', 'drive', 'succeed', 'gravelly', 'belting', 'voice', 'Etta', 'James', 'Ali', 'evenings', 'alone', 'reading', 'books', 'history', 'burlesque', 'preparing', 'chance', 'spite', 'good', 'moments', 'story', 'line', 'predictable', 'Ali', 'up', 'lead', 'role', 'club', 'what', 'mentoring', 'seemingly', 'hard-minded', 'Tess', 'movie', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'Ali', 'club', 'bartender', 'aspiring', 'pop', 'composer', 'begin', 'what', 'most', 'part', 'surprisingly', 'sexless', 'romance.I', 'thought', 'Cher', 'acting', 'was', 'mostly', 'wooden', 'scenes', 'Tess', 'better', 'own', 'vocal', 'numbers', 'especially', 'soliloquy', 'song', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'last', 'late', 'movie', 'also', 'effective', 'scenes', 'wisecracking', 'gay', 'assistant', 'former', 'lover', 'long', 'ago', 'Sean', 'played', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'dance', 'numbers', 'Aguilar', 'singing', 'are', 'effective', 'way', 'are', 'not', 'sexual', 'are', 'little', 'burlesque', 'brief', 'scenes', 'offering', 'cameos', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'streets', 'cheap', 'apartments', 'help', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'them.The', 'movie', 'old-fashioned', 'musical', 'modestly', 'entertaining', 'bland', 'almost', 'utterly', 'wholesome', 'toothless', 'Something', 'more', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'subject.3.5', 'stars.Robin', 'Friedman']",N/A
1300843,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B002ZG976U,,"[8, 13]","I don't know what I was expecting from ""Burlesque"", but it disappointed me on nearly every level. It's basically just a vehicle for Christina Aguilera. Let's go through the threadbare plot first...small town waitress Aguilera dreams of being on stage. She quits the day job and goes to LA...stumbling across a Burlesque club run by Cher, she wangles herself a waitress job, then eventually wangles her way onto the stage as a dancer and then - yes! - her big break suddenly comes when she unexpectedly bursts into live song and the audience is blown away. Well, the fictious audience in the film is, anyway. The real audience watching this movie will have seen that coming while they were outside buying tickets to get in.It's not a badly made film, it's just so awfully lame. Christina can act passably, but she suggests no depth whatsoever: she just reads the lines and leaves it at that. Cher is much more interesting (as I expected), although with her botoxed face, the acting skills that previously shone in films like ""Mask"" have all but vanished - at one point she comforts a character with a hug, and then ""poignantly"" grimaces behind his back - but she can't even move her face enough do it! The bald guy with glasses who played the sharp-tongued gay stylist in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" turns up playing an exact same character here...how lazy. And the sub-plot involving the former star of the show who is upstaged by Aguilera is as weak as dishwater. Her one big act of sabotage is to switch off the pre-recorded vocals that the girls are miming to right in the middle of Aguilera's turn. Oh but - what a surprise - Christina chucks the mike away and belts out the vocals herself and saves the show. Where's the tension in rivalry when we all saw that one coming a mile off? Even ""Showgirls"" had more convincing back-stabbing than this.Further things that fall flat are the songs that punctuate the running time. Apart from plenty of the show numbers, we get Christina belting (she belts most things) out a number alone in her diner with a mop, then a bit later on we get Cher ostensibly rehearsing a song, which is an ""I Will Survive"" style torch song about being strong and not giving up, played just after her character has come to the edge of despair over huge debts. I mean, give us some credit here - we do get it! Plus there's no way the song she sings would ever be featured in the show - what burlesque audience would pay to see an song like that? Having her rehearse a happy song but showing her sorrow in an undercurrent would have been far more rivetting. Same goes for Christina later on, when the character finds true love (oh you knew that, didn't you?), the scene is immediately followed by her singing a sultry slow song about true love... wearing an evening gown! Again rather odd because the club earns it's money by the performers singing raunchy songs while dressed like strippers. Again, it's sledgehammer symbolism that insults the viewers intelligence.The only high points of the film are Cher, who steals the show (shame about the wax facial expression), and if you're a Christina fan, she does her thing as well as in any of her music videos - which is all this is really. A lot like the video to ""Lady Marmalade"", but without all the other girls. But apart from that it's dull, dull, DULL. I watched it on a plane, and it was about my 3rd choice. I think thats the best I can say about it.",2,YAWN!!!,1300406400,"03 18, 2011",2011,3426,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'Burlesque', 'disappointed', 'nearly', 'level', 'basically', 'just', 'vehicle', 'Christina', 'Aguilera', 'Let', 'go', 'threadbare', 'plot', 'first', 'small', 'town', 'waitress', 'Aguilera', 'dreams', 'being', 'stage', 'day', 'job', 'LA', 'stumbling', 'Burlesque', 'club', 'run', 'Cher', 'waitress', 'job', 'then', 'eventually', 'way', 'stage', 'dancer', 'then', 'yes', 'big', 'break', 'suddenly', 'when', 'unexpectedly', 'live', 'song', 'audience', 'blown', 'away', 'Well', 'fictious', 'audience', 'film', 'anyway', 'real', 'audience', 'watching', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'seen', 'coming', 'were', 'outside', 'buying', 'tickets', 'get', 'in.It', 'not', 'badly', 'made', 'film', 'just', 'so', 'awfully', 'lame', 'Christina', 'can', 'act', 'passably', 'depth', 'whatsoever', 'just', 'lines', 'Cher', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'expected', 'botoxed', 'face', 'acting', 'skills', 'previously', 'shone', 'films', 'Mask', 'have', 'vanished', 'one', 'point', 'character', 'hug', 'then', 'poignantly', 'grimaces', 'back', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'move', 'face', 'enough', 'do', 'bald', 'guy', 'glasses', 'who', 'played', 'sharp-tongued', 'gay', 'stylist', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'up', 'playing', 'exact', 'same', 'character', 'here', 'how', 'lazy', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'former', 'star', 'show', 'who', 'upstaged', 'Aguilera', 'as', 'weak', 'dishwater', 'one', 'big', 'act', 'sabotage', 'switch', 'off', 'pre-recorded', 'vocals', 'girls', 'are', 'miming', 'right', 'middle', 'Aguilera', 'turn', 'Oh', 'what', 'surprise', 'Christina', 'mike', 'away', 'belts', 'out', 'vocals', 'show', 'Where', 'tension', 'rivalry', 'when', 'saw', 'one', 'coming', 'mile', 'off', 'Even', 'Showgirls', 'had', 'more', 'convincing', 'back-stabbing', 'this.Further', 'things', 'fall', 'flat', 'are', 'songs', 'punctuate', 'running', 'time', 'Apart', 'plenty', 'show', 'numbers', 'get', 'Christina', 'belting', 'most', 'things', 'out', 'number', 'alone', 'diner', 'mop', 'then', 'bit', 'later', 'get', 'Cher', 'ostensibly', 'rehearsing', 'song', 'Will', 'Survive', 'style', 'torch', 'song', 'being', 'strong', 'not', 'giving', 'up', 'played', 'just', 'character', 'come', 'edge', 'despair', 'huge', 'debts', 'mean', 'give', 'credit', 'here', 'do', 'get', 'way', 'song', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'featured', 'show', 'what', 'burlesque', 'audience', 'would', 'pay', 'see', 'song', 'Having', 'rehearse', 'happy', 'song', 'showing', 'sorrow', 'undercurrent', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'rivetting', 'Same', 'Christina', 'later', 'when', 'character', 'true', 'love', 'knew', 'did', ""n't"", 'scene', 'immediately', 'followed', 'singing', 'sultry', 'slow', 'song', 'true', 'love', 'wearing', 'evening', 'gown', 'Again', 'rather', 'odd', 'club', 'money', 'performers', 'singing', 'raunchy', 'songs', 'dressed', 'strippers', 'Again', 'sledgehammer', 'symbolism', 'viewers', 'intelligence.The', 'only', 'high', 'points', 'film', 'are', 'Cher', 'who', 'show', 'shame', 'wax', 'facial', 'expression', ""'re"", 'Christina', 'fan', 'thing', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'videos', 'really', 'lot', 'video', 'Lady', 'Marmalade', 'other', 'girls', 'apart', 'dull', 'dull', 'DULL', 'watched', 'plane', 'was', '3rd', 'choice', 'think', 'best', 'can', 'say']",N/A

I have seen countless movie musicals from the days of Busby Berkley, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Bing Crosby, and Gene Kelly. Its really all about the songs, music and dance!!! This is a vehicle that showcases the amazing talents of Christina Aguilera, and shows us Cher at 64 has still got what made her famous too! Cher and Christina have BOTH been nominated for ""Best Song"" Golden Globe awards from Burlesque, and both deserve it. In addition, if there is any Oscar Buzz it should go to the stage designers, lighting engineers and cinematographers that made every frame of this incredible film a work of art. They have set a landmark for stage lighting. Not that it needs it, but this film could have been pretty amazing in 3-D too.

How could I not be allured by a movie that offers everything a burlesque show does; amazing numbers, songs and dances, raunchy humor, and sexually humorous numbers. I'm not a pervert, I'm a gay man who does appreciate the beauty in women.I have to give Burlesque some definite complements; it flows well, the music is great, all the characters were written well and likable, and the cast was superb. I believe that Cher should have won the Oscar for ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me"". But we all know they're rigged.Christina Aguilera does not disappoint with her amazing vocal talents. And surprised me for her acting debut on the big screen. I can see her being an actress/singer now; she was believable, owned the lines, did not just remember them, she preformed.All the numbers are as memorable as Chicago's with Renee and Catherine; though the story wasn't as strong. Some could complain the love interest in the movie was cheesy and predictable, but honestly, all rom-coms are and any romantic romance. Only TV has people seriously thinking ""will ____ and ____ get together?""Overall; highly recommended.

I've seen a lot of comparisons to CHICAGO here but there are other musicals which this clearly aspires to equal but it never makes it.  Those are MOULIN ROUGE, DREAMGIRLS, STAR IS BORN, CABARET and FUNNY GIRL.  This film is closer to DREAMGIRLS on what it attains than any of the others.  The others have better scriots and better music.  They all share the girl who starts out with nothing but her raw talent, gets a break and becomes a sensation. Will success ruin her and her falling in love with her true love?There is nothing new in this story and it is not as well presented as it was in the other above named musicals.  Also, you will not leave the theater humming the music you heard in the show for the next week.If the script was removed and instead this became a performance film with the two leads, I would probably give it at least one more star. I found myself waiting for the musical numbers because the.script was so derivative and bad.Why do so many viewers like it then?  One certainly is compelled to say that Christina Aguilera gives this her all.  We always knew she was a great singer but here she also shows she can dance and act.  I would love to see her in a better musical vehicle.  Cher, of course, is always marvelous too and she doesn't disappoint here as the woman who owns the theater and gives the girl her break.  Stanley Tucci is her marvelous gay best friend.  Two men are the love interests.  The nice one is indeed very attractive.  The creep is yes, a creep.  There is nothing new or dynamic that they add to the film and it might have added something to put in men with some musical talent instead.

I've always liked Cher, most of the time have enjoyed Christina, and the movie sounded like a lot of fun.  It was!First of all, the music was grand.  I just finished watching and immediately got online to order the soundtrack. Only a couple of songs by Cher but ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me"" tore my heart out - Cher at her very best. And Christina! Wow -what can I say. I've never heard her any better. I especially loved ""Bound to You""; ""Something's Got a Hold On Me""; ""Tough Lover""; ""Guy What Takes His Time""; and ""Show Me How You Burlesque."" None of the songs are bad, though.There was a great cast of secondary actors.  Stanley Tucci outdid himself.  Cam Gigandet was a hot love interest for Christina's character, Ali.  Alan Cumming had a small part but I loved him.  Eric Dane and Peter Gallagher played what they play best - men that are not easy to like.

Preferred traits: American (from a small town), white, young, sexy but not in a flagrant ""slutty"" way, hugely talented, determined, befriends/bewitches all she meets, bends the rules but never gets into any real trouble from it, gets a job by simply picking up a tray and starting to wait tables, can learn dance moves in a few weeks during her work as a waitress in Club, earns grudging respect from ""enemies"", able to resolve conflicts in a single bound, best if played by a former pop starlet who has decent acting talents1 actor/singer in a comeback role.  Best if actor/singer was greatly loved and drawn out of retirement for this role.Several decent actors and actresses thrown at cliched or underused roles to taste.1 drunken/high rival who succumbs to the Power of the Mary Sue.  Choose a mild rival, one that doesn't do anything too mean and ""rival-y"".Several mildly sexual dance numbers with Mary Sue, but do not recreate anything as risque as an actual Burlesque show.1 song number with comeback singer/actor that is thrown awkwardly into the plot.  Optional: Make the song one about ""overcoming"" some undefined ""obstacle"".2 Love Interests.  Love Interest A (may or may not be the first guy Mary Sue meets) must be sweet, romantic and witty.  Love Interest B must be a super wealthy businessman wanting to buy the Club, who will drop the Chekov's Gun so Mary Sue can solve the problem and will disappear from the movie when True LoveTM conquers all.1 discreet sex scene with Love Interest A.  Best if this scene is intercut with a melodic ballad about True LoveTM sung while Mary Sue is dressed in a classy evening gown at the Club.5+ plot lines.  One must be the Romantic Triangle.  Please choose remaining from the following: drunken Rival, Divorced Club Owners working together, Gay Best Friend who can't have a decent relationship, the Club is closing because the Owners need X dollars in Y months (X MUST BE much, much greater than Y), Club Owner and one of the dancers has a falling out wherein dancer says she slept with Club Owner's husband, Love Interest A is a Songwriter, Love Interest A is engaged but will let his sexy ""Friend"" stay with him for an indeterminate amount of time, Love Interest B was never Rival's ""boyfriend""Gather ingredients in a large, flashy location (Los Angeles works if New York City is not available).  Toss indiscriminantly for two hours; Serve immediately.Now, despite all that I've written above...the movie actually isn't half bad.  Yes, it's cliched, yes, Christina's character is a glaring Mary Sue, yes, the characters are one dimensional.  But if you expect that going in (like I did), there is a lot you can enjoy.Christina Aguilera isn't a half bad actress.  The only reason she doesn't get higher marks in my book is because her character is so painfully cliched, and Christina never tried to add any depth to that portrayal.  But she does sing well (for those that like her brand of singing), and her dancing is WOW!  Cher is amazing.  She lit up the screen every time she was on, and I thought her portrayal of a club owner about to go under was one of the most convincing I've ever seen.  I loved her musical numbers as well and wished she had sung more.  Stanley Tucci was stunning.  Sure, he is yet again Gay Best Friend, but he does it well without coming off too cliched.  And his chemistry against Cher was pure joy.  Some of the musical numbers were bland (another version of ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend""?), but others were really great (the last number was really catchy).So, if you are a Cher or Christina Aguilera fan, you will probably love this.  If you love musicals, you will probably also like this (maybe not as much, since it is cliched).  It's not the most original movie out there, but it isn't the worst I've ever seen.Brought to you by:*C.S.

Jordan ""Voracious Reader""","[1, 1]","I just watched this last night, bought the DVD & will be keeping it to rewatch again & again; in fact I'm hoping there is a soundtrack album to buy here next. Luckily I pay little attention to critics & as others have already said, the critics were crazy or blind, deaf & dumb. I'm not at all a fan of musicals, can't think of a single one I'd want to watch once through, never mind repeatedly. The only other musical I might watch again would be a Chorus Line, maybe.However, this is a movie as much as a musical, if not more so. The story drove the musical numbers, not the other way around as is often the case. The viewer becomes involved in the character's struggles, stories, failures & successes. The actors are amazing in this, not a one slacked off anywhere in this film. The lip syncing was a bit obvious in many of the scenes, not a one live singing, but Christina & Cher, both being pros, did it so well you really had to work to catch the lip syncing. I was surprised at the acting talent Christina proved in this movie, none of it obvious or fake. Cher is as fabulous as ever, sounding & looking good, if a wee bit rough around the edges, but one had to really look to see such. My one pet peeve is with the wigs used throughout the film, all were obvious fakes, being a Barber-stylist I notice such things more than the average person. When you can see light through sections of hair, it's usually a wig, since natural hair fills in those spaces, and Cher's were the worst, left me wondering what her real hair looks like these days. Christina's were more natural looking so that it was difficult to figure out which was the wig vs. real hair, only obvious in a few scenes, but her character uses wigs in the performance, so that's to be expected; Cher's character does NOT have that excuse.The special features left much to be desired, a making-of should have been included, costume & other information could easily have been added but weren't. The bloopers were hilarious is short, the 6 full song numbers left out several better ones in the film that I wanted to see more, especially the last song & dance ""Show Me How You Burlesque"" which was some of the best music in this film. The different music styles used will appeal to all audiences of any age, the dancing & costumes were sexy yet tastefully done, and whoever choreographed this movie should have their name up in lights because the dancing in this film was the most original I've ever seen, including such other movies as Step Up.

The word derives from the Italian burlesco, which itself derives from the Italian burla - a joke, ridicule or mockery.'  This is a riot of color and good fun and snazzy production numbers a la Bob Fosse takeoffs. The story is predictable and silly and the script borders on mediocre, but with the talent and pizzazz of the cast, none of that matters!Ali (Christine Aguilera) flees Iowa in hopes of a career in show biz and happens into a Sunset Strip Burlesque House run by 'still not down' Tess (Cher) who knows her business is failing, despite the solid help from her gay assistant Sean (Stanley Tucci) and the warnings of her ex-husband/partner Vince (Peter Gallagher).  Tess has problems with some of her lip-synching cast, namely Nikki (Kristen Bell), and is being hounded to sell her club to the wealthy boyfriend of Nikki - Marcus (Eric Dane).  Ali observes, wants to be in the show, but is offered the job of waitress in the club by bartender/songwriter Jack (Cam Gigandet), a guy so kind that he shares his little flat with her.  Ali is persistent and when given a chance to audition she gets into the cast. Her trump card is that she is such a terrific singer that she converts the club away from lip-synching into a full-blown song and dance place.  Romance of course flutters in as do other little sidebars (including a strange quickie by doorman Alexis (Alan Cumming), but the main attractions are the glitzy stage numbers by a surprisingly fine Aguilera and by Cher herself.

The just released "" Burlesque"" written and directed by Steve Antin is just as predictable and traditional as a Thanksgiving dinner and just as good. You know how the story will end but that doesn't matter. Small-town girl leaves a nothing-job and goes to Los Angeles to make it big. And does she ever. Aging but ageless nightclub owner fights to keep her club open. Replaced entertainer gets vicious. Roommate becomes love object. Good triumphs over good business.Where the boys are first: It's easy to believe that Jack, bartender/musician/hump (Cam Gigandet) is someone a girl can fall for, assuming he's straight. Then there's Stanley Tucci who plays Sean, a similar character to what he did so well in ""The Devil Wears Prada."" But the women are the big winners here. Tess, the burlesque club owner is played by-- thanks to the miracle of plastic surgery, along with good living-- the ageless Cher who proves once again that though she is no Meryl Streep, she does certain parts very well indeed. And although in her mid-sixties, she can still sing a very soulful ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me,"" which, by the way, could be the theme of her many goodbye tours. The movie belongs, however, to Christina Aguilera, brilliantly cast as Ali Rose, the girl from the cornfields who sets L. A. and the men in the club back on their heels. Can she ever both sing and dance as she does one great song after another. She will remind you at times of Marilyn Monroe. The film itself with all its precision dance routines is reminiscent of ""Chicago"" with a little bit of ""The Birdcage"" thrown in for the sake of diversity.Good acting, good one-liners, wild costumes, fantastic acting and singing, old-fashioned love story.

It's not actually a sequel except in the sense it's the spiritual sequel. It's just as trashy. It's just as improbable, but in a way, it has better actors, such as Christina Aguilera in her film debut and Cher, who's great except for one tiny ""ick"" factor, which is her sixty-some year old upper lip has been botox'ed into an arctic frozen wasteland. That lip never moves, even when she's dancing her legs off.The plot is the usual ingenue-leaves-rural-Iowa-wants-to-dance-in-a-strip-club. The dancing is not as over-the-top as ""Showgirls"" nor are the costumes; this is more intimate--a burlesque club with tighter shots and more Bob Fosse-like dancing that looks slightly dated for 2010 but fits, all the same. All the women are followed by a dark past that threatens the rosy future, and they are rescued by bartenders with hearts of gold. There is ONE scene I really hate: Nikki, best friend of Tess (Cher) is drunk (as usual) but is ready to drive off after a fight with Tess. ""Nikki! Don't drive..."" says Tess only it's practically whispered, uh, Nikki, ho hum, don't drive, eh, oh well. And off storms Nikki. She could have grabbed the keys and had a girl fight.

Making all of the preceding palatable to the guys in the audience is the general air of sexiness pervading the proceedings, in large part generated by the wonderfully skimpy costumes worn by Ms. Aquilera and the variety of women performing on stage with her.

Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[3, 3]","I genuinely enjoyed the music, dancing and costumes in this, especially the more classic Burlesque pieces, with their sexy-funny-teasy-edgy flair. But the writing and acting was soooooo bad. My husband and I found ourselves just grimacing and groaning through certain scenes, especially those between Christina Aguilara and her love interest in the movie, played by Cam Gigandet from Twilight. Every line was a cliche, and even the best of actors (and these two are not) could not have saved them. I was also disappointed in Cher, who didn't feel very invested in the movie - she seemed to be phoning it in. Stanley Tucci was entertaining, and the only time I saw any of Cher's usual spark was in her scenes with him. The storyline had many loopholes, and basically was on the level of a cheesy TV episode.But the music, costumes and dancing were great, so I had fun during all of that. I think this movie was marketed poorly - they should have played up the campiness and everyone might have overlooked the bad writing/acting. But the studio tried to position it as a classy drama/musical, ala Chicago or Moulin Rouge, and the performances just weren't at that level. Then they threw in some scenes that stank of contract fulfillment - a complete non-sequitor Cher singing scene for instance - that undermined the integrity of the movie completely.I appreciate the 5-star reviewers here taking issue with the critics' panning of this movie, but I think they are over-correcting.

It may not be the best movie ever made, but it does offer a touch of entertainment, doesn't bore you to tears and even puts a smile on your face. BURLESQUE is one of those movies.Now by the name implied there are probably some who think that the movie involves non-stop strippers in various states of undress. Those folks will be disappointed. But fans of both Cher and Christina Aguilera and their singing abilities will find that the movie delivers all that they could hope for and more.Aguilera stars as Ali, a young girl from a small town with dreams of something more. She wants to sing and dance and so one day heads to Los Angeles. She arrives and searches for a job only to be turned down time after time. She sees the sign for a club called Burlesque and enters just to find out what's going on. Inside she sees a bevy of beauties dancing on stage in skimpy outfits lip synching some classic tunes. Desperate for a job, she's directed to the club's owner Tess (Cher) by bartender Jack (Can Gigandet).Ali stumbles through her request, begging for the chance to be a dancer in the show, but Tess turns her down telling her to come back when they have auditions. Returning to the bar Ali sees an opportunity when a waitress offers terrible service. Putting her past skills to use, Ali takes on the role of waitress telling Jack if she doesn't do better than his current staff, she'll walk but if she does, she gets a job. Needless to say she gets the job.Tess and show production co-coordinator/best friend Sean (Stanley Tucci) notice her working and let it pass. The shows star Nikki (Kristin Bell) notices her too and takes an instant disliking to Ali. Nikki is that typical bitchy star who thinks the world revolves around her and anyone who doesn't treat her as such deserves to be gone. But Ali hangs in there, waiting for her big chance.Months go by during which time Ali has her apartment broken into. Jack offers her a place to stay until she gets on her feet, but it's a purely platonic relationship since Jack's engaged (his girlfriend is in New York doing a play at the moment though). When audition time arrives, Ali takes to the stage but doesn't give the performance Tess is looking for. When she asks Tess what she wants Tess tells her she doesn't even know herself but that she has to take command of the stage and make it her own. Emboldened by this nugget of information, Ali gives an audition that floors Tess and Sean and is added to the line up of dancer, a move that doesn't sit well with Nikki.While this little drama is going on, Tess is fighting a losing battle to keep the club open. The club is and always has been her dream but her ex-husband and partner Vince (Peter Gallagher) sees it as nothing but a losing battle. Add to that a buzzard like businessman named Marcus (Eric Dane) who wants to buy the club to tear it down to build condos and you have problems. Ali suggests to Tess that they change it up and have the girls actually sing instead of lip synch but Tess won't listen.Nikki, always the trouble maker, always late and almost always drunk, fails to show for her set one night. Instead, Tess puts Ali in her place. As the girls begin their set, Nikki cuts the music track playing and Tess begins to bring down the curtain. All stops as soon as Ali begins to sing on her own with a voice that demands attention. The curtain rises, the band comes in and Ali takes control of the stage to a standing ovation.Now the centerpiece of the show, crowds begin to come into the club. A shrewd businessman, Marcus sets his eye on Ali, just as he did before on Nikki when she was the big draw. And as he begins to woo Ali, Jack sees a missed opportunity set in. The entire time he and Ali have lived together in his apartment the attraction was there, he just never acted on it.So the stage is set. Will Tess lose the club? Will Ali be a big enough draw to save it? Will Nikki find a way to stop it all from happening? Will Jack and Ali get together or will Marcus take her away and make her the star she always dreamed of? All answers are found before the movie ends.Some have said that this movie is nothing more than a retelling of COYOTE UGLY with different music. In some ways that's true but not entirely. The ing&eacute;nue trying to make it in big city after leaving a small town behind is there. Dancing and singing is there. But this movie has a different vibe to it. It's also been compared to SHOWGIRLS with a different setting and less skin. Once more, with the exception of the small town/big city story it offers something more. And is much less tacky.This is a feel good movie. You enjoy the musical numbers that are more along the lines of CHICAGO than they are the old Gene Kelly movies of the past. Aguilera does a pretty good job for this being her first major role in a big time film. If you just thought of her as another pretty face you'll be surprised. I've never been a big fan of her vocal styling but they fit the film perfectly. Cher is believable as the ex-dancer/singer with a dream of a place of her own. Bell does a great job as the catty star whose spotlight is taken away and Gigandet turns out to be not only a good actor but nice love interest for Aguilera to play off of.The movie is cotton candy for the eyes and ears. It offers some good music and some dynamite dance sequences. It's entertaining without going too deep. In essence it's a movie that makes you feel good and have a good time, something that more movies should do. I don't think this film ever intended to be an Oscar winner, but fans of musicals and of the cast will get their money's worth with this one.",4,RISQUE NOT RUDE,1299715200,"03 10,

1300894,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B002ZG976U,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[3, 3]","Burlesque may not be the newest story with its somewhat predictable plot; but the film is rather enjoyable nonetheless. Its strength comes from the multiple musical numbers and the acting of the main characters since the somewhat campy plot is not the deepest and the action takes its time to play out. Cher, Stanley Tucci, Christina Aguilera and Cam Gigandet of Twilight fame provide wonderful performances. In addition, the choreography and cinematography are excellent; and the musical score enhances the film quite a bit.When the film starts, we quickly meet Ali (short for ""Alice,"" played by Christina Aguilera) who works in a local bar in a small town in Iowa. Although she's rather young, Ali believes in herself, knows she has talent--and she's convinced she's going nowhere fast. She travels by bus to Los Angeles and after some pushing finds work in a burlesque nightclub that has seen better days owned primarily by Tess (Cher) with Tess' ex Vince (Peter Gallagher) having a partial financial interest in the club. Ali also makes friends with a bartender named Jack (Cam Gigandet) and this proves helpful when her apartment is broken into--Ali's savings has been stolen and Jack (who has a fianc&eacute;e) lets Ali stay at his place until Ali can get another home and become more settled.Of course, things get more complicated. Ali and Jack start noticing each other while Jack's fianc&eacute;e Natalie (Dianna Agron) is in New York doing a play. Ali eventually makes her way onto the stage in Tess' club as a dancer just like she dreamed of doing--but a real surprise comes when jealous dancer Nikki (Kristen Bell) pulls the plug on the lip-synching music and Ali must face the crowd and sing.In addition, Eric Dane does a good job of playing Marcus, a rich guy who buys his way into getting everything he ever wants--including Tess' club so he can use it according to his own plans. Tess must find a way to keep her club which is running dangerously low on funds to make payments and stay open; and things look pretty bleak; it would break Tess' heart to lose or even sell her club.You might think I already gave away too much; but I assure you that I haven't. Moreover, I won't say much more for fear of adding spoilers; suffice it to say that you will be struck by the musical numbers in this film. Christina Aguilera in her very first film already seems destined to become a film star seemingly effortlessly!The DVD comes with alternate footage that I liked and there is a short of ""bloopers.""Overall, Burlesque probably won't win Best Picture at Oscar time but it's entertaining nonetheless. Fans of the actors in the film will want this for their collections; and people who enjoy musicals with a side dish of camp will want this, too.",4,"""Alice, hm?

1300895,A1Z6AXXBRHP4A9,B002ZG976U,Matthew J. Uhley,"[5, 7]","The film succeeds with its primary selling point: the songs and dances are SPECTACULAR. I now know what it's like for women to have multiple orgasms after watching some of these sequences. Christina and co. shake it to titillating, breathless choreography. The camera knows where and when to cut, infusing every number with even more excitement but not obscuring the action. My personal favorite is when Christina's outfit is gradually flung away, leaving only a few giant feathers covering her naughty bits. Both sexy and funny.You don't need me to tell you how incredible the songs are. I prefer Christina's voice to Cher's (as well, You Haven't Seen The Last Of Me seemed superfluous and too on-the-nose) but I think fans of both will be more than satisfied with the soundtrack.The big question everyone wants answered is ""Can Christina act""?My answer? YES! I say this not as an adoring fan (although I am, of course) but as someone with a degree in film. She has an easy, unforced charm that sparkles on the silver screen. No, scratch that: she's practically glowing! I am so pleased to announce that Christina actually gives one of the movie's best performances. I completely bought her character and even when the writing became weak at times, she was always at the top of her game. You can tell Christina was enthusiastic about the role and she fortunately didn't overplay it at all. I think there's a film career ahead of her if she wants it.Stanley Tucci clearly has the best supporting part and is totally hilarious. Only problem is, he needed to be in more of the movie. As did Kristen Bell and especially Alan Cumming. Their characters were way more interesting than those of the two male leads. I hope their scenes didn't end up on the cutting room floor.Besides some cheesy lines scattered throughout, my only big criticisms are with:1. The bank subplot which I didn't care about (although it has a clever resolution).2. Cam Gigandet's character and less-than-stellar performance.Cam doesn't ruin the movie but his role wasn't compellingly written and Christina had him licked in the acting department. She could have chemistry with a lamp but he seems to be a bit distant in the role which doesn't allow the sparks to fly as much as they should.Is Burlesque filled with clich&eacute;s? Well, duh! It's supposed to be a lighthearted musical in which the plot takes a back seat to the theatrics. Y'know, older films in the genre were actually like that. Sure, I prefer Moulin Rouge! but then again, that movie doesn't have any numbers by Christina.",4,"It's a life, it's a style, it's a need, it's burlesque",1294272000,"01 6, 2011",2011,2561,"['film', 'primary', 'selling', 'point', 'songs', 'dances', 'are', 'SPECTACULAR', 'now', 'know', 'what', 'women', 'have', 'multiple', 'orgasms', 'watching', 'sequences', 'Christina', 'co.', 'shake', 'titillating', 'breathless', 'choreography', 'camera', 'where', 'when', 'cut', 'infusing', 'number', 'even', 'more', 'excitement', 'not', 'obscuring', 'action', 'personal', 'favorite', 'when', 'Christina', 'outfit', 'gradually', 'flung', 'away', 'leaving', 'only', 'few', 'giant', 'feathers', 'covering', 'naughty', 'bits', 'sexy', 'funny.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'tell', 'how', 'incredible', 'songs', 'are', 'prefer', 'Christina', 'voice', 'Cher', 'as', 'well', 'Have', ""n't"", 'Seen', 'Last', 'Me', 'seemed', 'superfluous', 'too', 'on-the-nose', 'think', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'satisfied', 'soundtrack.The', 'big', 'question', 'everyone', 'answered', 'Can', 'Christina', 'act', 'answer', 'YES', 'say', 'not', 'adoring', 'fan', 'am', 'course', 'someone', 'degree', 'film', 'easy', 'unforced', 'charm', 'silver', 'screen', 'No', 'scratch', 'practically', 'glowing', 'am', 'so', 'pleased', 'announce', 'Christina', 'actually', 'one', 'movie', 'best', 'performances', 'completely', 'bought', 'character', 'even', 'when', 'writing', 'became', 'weak', 'times', 'was', 'always', 'top', 'game', 'can', 'tell', 'Christina', 'was', 'enthusiastic', 'role', 'fortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'overplay', 'think', 'film', 'career', 'ahead', 'it.Stanley', 'Tucci', 'clearly', 'best', 'supporting', 'part', 'totally', 'hilarious', 'Only', 'problem', 'needed', 'be', 'more', 'movie', 'did', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'especially', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'characters', 'were', 'way', 'more', 'interesting', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'hope', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'cutting', 'room', 'cheesy', 'lines', 'scattered', 'only', 'big', 'criticisms', 'are', 'with:1', 'bank', 'subplot', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'about', 'clever', 'resolution', '.2', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', 'character', 'less-than-stellar', 'performance.Cam', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'movie', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'compellingly', 'written', 'Christina', 'had', 'licked', 'acting', 'department', 'could', 'have', 'chemistry', 'lamp', 'be', 'bit', 'distant', 'role', ""n't"", 'allow', 'sparks', 'fly', 'as', 'much', 'should.Is', 'Burlesque', 'filled', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Well', 'duh', 'supposed', 'be', 'lighthearted', 'musical', 'plot', 'back', 'seat', 'theatrics', ""Y'know"", 'older', 'films', 'genre', 'were', 'actually', 'Sure', 'prefer', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'then', 'again', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'numbers', 'Christina']",N/A
1300896,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B002ZG976U,M. Bullions,"[11, 14]","When I originally heard of the concept for Steven Antin's Burlesque, a movie musical starring pop phenom Christina Aguilera and the legendary Cher, I was, if you could believe it, less than enthusiastic. I was under the assumption that this film would be not just bad, but god awful. Recalling horrid pop star film debuts (ex. Mariah Carey in the depressingly hollow Glitter, Britney Spears in the mind-numbing Crossroads) I thought I was in for a cinematic train wreck of epic proportions. And I'm happy to tell you today, that I couldn't have been more wrong.First of all, what makes Burlesque unlike Glitter and Crossroads is its aesthetics. Christina Aguilera's strong voice is enough to carry a film, as it turns out. However, Burlesque has more to fall back on. Cher plays Tess, Aguilera's character's boss and mentor. She can make any film excellent. Secondly, this film is a musical, also unlike Glitter and Crossroads. It shoots for being something of a hybrid between Cabaret and Chicago, and doesn't completely fail. Thirdly, this film has an outstanding supporting cast, including the always great Stanley Tucci, Grey's Anatomy vet Eric Dane, Kristen Bell, Cam Gigandet, and Alan Cumming, and these folks bring enough liveliness to save even the worst film, but here, they only add to the fun and excitement.The story is really nothing new. Small-town girl Ali (Aguilera) leaves her job as an Iowan waitress, and heads for the big lights of Los Angeles. She stumbles upon a burlesque club run by Tess (Cher), starts working her way up, and eventually becomes the main attraction, with her intense vocal range and elaborate interpretations of dance numbers, which turns out to be a godsend for Tess, who is about to lose her club. She starts living with the charismatic and sexy bartender Jack (Cam Gigandet), after her apartment gets robbed. Romance ensues, and things go from there.Cliche, right? It's been done before, right? Right. There isn't a section of this film that isn't even a little bit corny. But, that's not to say it's not a load of fun. I'm sorry, Harry Potter, Burlesque is the film event of the Thanksgiving holiday. Christina Aguilera isn't a fantastic actress, but she's better than you would expect her to be, and her song-and-dance numbers, obviously, are fantastic, as one would expect.She and Cher have fantastic chemistry, as well as Cher and Stanley Tucci. All of these actors blend together so well, that they seem to compliment each other, enhancing each performance. And, I was rather disappointed to see that Cher only sang two out of the film's ten musical numbers, but it's safe to say that that's not enough, considering that she can still belt the hell out of these songs. However, Cher's obvious plastic surgeries don't help her performance, considering that her face barely moves throughout the entire picture, but she's still able to pull this role off, somehow.Steven Antin is a director whom I've never heard of, however, I was fairly impressed. The film is directed with impeccable taste, and the writing is very quick and clever, and humorous, even when a little corny.However, what really saves Burlesque in the end is its elaborate song-and-dance numbers. Soon after the movie begins, you know what kind of film you're in for. Even as cliche after cliche presents themselves, Burlesque has enough razzle-dazzle magic to outweigh its faults, and to leave you dancing in the aisles as you leave this film.",5,Burlesque: The return of the movie-musical!,1291075200,"11 30, 2010",2010,3458,"['When', 'originally', 'heard', 'concept', 'Steven', 'Antin', 'Burlesque', 'movie', 'musical', 'starring', 'pop', 'phenom', 'Christina', 'Aguilera', 'legendary', 'Cher', 'was', 'could', 'believe', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'was', 'assumption', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'not', 'just', 'bad', 'god', 'awful', 'Recalling', 'horrid', 'pop', 'star', 'film', 'debuts', 'ex', 'Mariah', 'Carey', 'depressingly', 'hollow', 'Glitter', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'mind-numbing', 'Crossroads', 'thought', 'was', 'cinematic', 'train', 'wreck', 'epic', 'proportions', ""'m"", 'happy', 'tell', 'today', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'wrong.First', 'what', 'Burlesque', 'Glitter', 'Crossroads', 'aesthetics', 'Christina', 'Aguilera', 'strong', 'voice', 'enough', 'carry', 'film', 'out', 'However', 'Burlesque', 'more', 'fall', 'back', 'Cher', 'Tess', 'Aguilera', 'character', 'boss', 'mentor', 'can', 'make', 'film', 'excellent', 'Secondly', 'film', 'musical', 'also', 'Glitter', 'Crossroads', 'being', 'something', 'hybrid', 'Cabaret', 'Chicago', ""n't"", 'completely', 'fail', 'Thirdly', 'film', 'outstanding', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'always', 'great', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'vet', 'Eric', 'Dane', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'folks', 'bring', 'enough', 'liveliness', 'save', 'even', 'worst', 'film', 'here', 'only', 'add', 'fun', 'excitement.The', 'story', 'really', 'nothing', 'new', 'Small-town', 'girl', 'Ali', 'Aguilera', 'job', 'Iowan', 'waitress', 'heads', 'big', 'lights', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'burlesque', 'club', 'run', 'Tess', 'Cher', 'working', 'way', 'eventually', 'main', 'attraction', 'intense', 'vocal', 'range', 'elaborate', 'interpretations', 'dance', 'numbers', 'out', 'be', 'godsend', 'Tess', 'who', 'lose', 'club', 'living', 'charismatic', 'sexy', 'bartender', 'Jack', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', 'apartment', 'robbed', 'Romance', 'ensues', 'things', 'go', 'there.Cliche', 'right', 'been', 'done', 'right', 'Right', ""n't"", 'section', 'film', ""n't"", 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'corny', 'not', 'say', 'not', 'load', 'fun', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Burlesque', 'film', 'event', 'Thanksgiving', 'holiday', 'Christina', 'Aguilera', ""n't"", 'fantastic', 'actress', 'better', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'song-and-dance', 'numbers', 'obviously', 'are', 'fantastic', 'one', 'would', 'expect.She', 'Cher', 'have', 'fantastic', 'chemistry', 'as', 'well', 'Cher', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'actors', 'blend', 'together', 'so', 'well', 'seem', 'compliment', 'other', 'enhancing', 'performance', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'see', 'Cher', 'only', 'sang', 'two', 'film', 'ten', 'musical', 'numbers', 'safe', 'say', 'not', 'enough', 'considering', 'can', 'still', 'belt', 'hell', 'songs', 'However', 'Cher', 'obvious', 'plastic', 'surgeries', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'performance', 'considering', 'face', 'barely', 'entire', 'picture', 'still', 'able', 'pull', 'role', 'off', 'somehow.Steven', 'Antin', 'director', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'however', 'was', 'fairly', 'impressed', 'film', 'directed', 'impeccable', 'taste', 'writing', 'very', 'quick', 'clever', 'humorous', 'even', 'when', 'little', 'corny.However', 'what', 'really', 'Burlesque', 'end', 'elaborate', 'song-and-dance', 'numbers', 'Soon', 'movie', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'film', ""'re"", 'Even', 'cliche', 'cliche', 'presents', 'Burlesque', 'enough', 'razzle-dazzle', 'magic', 'outweigh', 'faults', 'leave', 'dancing', 'aisles', 'leave', 'film']",N/A

To me - a short, uncoordinated, curvy girl - being a dancer sounds brilliant. Unfortunately, rather than take dance classes when I was young, I preferred to watch cartoons. So there must a part of me that still dreams she could be a dancer, so I get by watching these movies. Give me Showgirls, Coyote Ugly (although technically singing but never mind), Save The Last Dance, and Make It Happen and I'm a happy girl.Despite this being delayed for a little while on DVD, I finally got a copy to watch and LOVED it immediately. The movie starts off with a very YOUNG looking Christina (playing Ali) stuck in a dead end job in Nowhere-ville, dreaming of being a singer and a dancer. She ups sticks to LA and walks into a slightly camp looking bar called Burlesque and comes face to face with her dreams. And Cher. Cher manages to steal every single scene with her remarkable body for a woman in her sixties and stunning powerhouse vocals, which Christina, once she gets going, really can match.The storyline is pretty standard - I could have written it my sleep. There's nothing shocking, just very safe in terms of the storyline and characters. You've got the pretty girl who wants to make it big, the owner who's got a Heart of Stone until the right person gets close, the bad girl who will have you shouting insults at the screen, the token gay men and the token hot guy who sheds his clothes and wears eyeliner. (And has a very memorable scene with a box of cookies and not much else. That scene could keep a girl warm on a lonely night!) Oh and the bad guy who can't act, trying to steal the good girl away from the hot guy.The soundrack was amazing, and I was actually dancing in my chair a few times, and of course it will be a necessity to buy the soundtrack and play it at full volume and pretend I'm Christina Aguilera in front of a crowd of adoring people. The only thing that is missing from the soundtrack is a duet. What were they thinking??? How could they not combine Cher and Christina's talents by having them duet? Shockingly remiss of them.The last movie I saw Stanley Tucci in was The Lovely Bones - and from that movie to this, he plays completely different characters, to the point where my Dad doubted it was the same guy. He doesn't have that major a role in this film, apart from the funny gay guy who makes a brilliant comedy double act with Cher. (Did I mention she's looking AMAZING for a woman of her tender years?!)The only quibbles I have about this movie is Alan Cumming and the running time. Alan Cumming seems just a random character, thrown into the mix for no other reason than to interact with Ali when she comes into the club, and do a saucy little dance routine between dancers. It was such a throw away scene, that seemed to have been maybe added in with Alan larking around between takes. And his one ""singing"" scene is stuck in the extras. The running time is close to two hours, but could have easily been shorter and still not lost any of the storyline. And the extras could have been a bit more meaty too. Cut dance routines and a blooper reel? Give me something more exciting please!This movie is never going to win any awards - it's a feel good, enjoyable film with plenty of eye candy for the gentlemen and the ladies to both enjoy. So drag your partner by the hand to see this and get practising your dance moves. Or get the DVD and clear some space in the living room and shake what your mama gave you!",4,Life is about the choices you make,1306281600,"05 25, 2011",2011,3499,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'ages', 'short', 'uncoordinated', 'curvy', 'girl', 'being', 'dancer', 'brilliant', 'Unfortunately', 'rather', 'take', 'dance', 'classes', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'preferred', 'watch', 'cartoons', 'So', 'there', 'must', 'part', 'still', 'could', 'be', 'dancer', 'get', 'watching', 'movies', 'Give', 'Showgirls', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'technically', 'singing', 'never', 'mind', 'Save', 'Last', 'Dance', 'Make', 'Happen', ""'m"", 'happy', 'girl.Despite', 'being', 'delayed', 'little', 'while', 'DVD', 'finally', 'got', 'copy', 'watch', 'LOVED', 'immediately', 'movie', 'very', 'YOUNG', 'looking', 'Christina', 'playing', 'Ali', 'stuck', 'dead', 'end', 'job', 'Nowhere-ville', 'dreaming', 'being', 'singer', 'dancer', 'ups', 'sticks', 'LA', 'walks', 'slightly', 'camp', 'looking', 'bar', 'called', 'Burlesque', 'face', 'face', 'dreams', 'Cher', 'Cher', 'steal', 'single', 'scene', 'remarkable', 'body', 'woman', 'sixties', 'stunning', 'powerhouse', 'vocals', 'Christina', 'once', 'going', 'really', 'can', 'match.The', 'storyline', 'pretty', 'standard', 'could', 'have', 'written', 'sleep', 'nothing', 'shocking', 'just', 'very', 'safe', 'terms', 'storyline', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'got', 'pretty', 'girl', 'who', 'make', 'big', 'owner', 'who', 'got', 'Heart', 'Stone', 'right', 'person', 'close', 'bad', 'girl', 'who', 'will', 'have', 'shouting', 'insults', 'screen', 'token', 'gay', 'men', 'token', 'hot', 'guy', 'who', 'clothes', 'eyeliner', 'very', 'memorable', 'scene', 'box', 'cookies', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'scene', 'could', 'keep', 'girl', 'warm', 'lonely', 'night', 'Oh', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'trying', 'steal', 'good', 'girl', 'away', 'hot', 'guy.The', 'soundrack', 'was', 'amazing', 'was', 'actually', 'dancing', 'chair', 'few', 'times', 'course', 'will', 'be', 'necessity', 'buy', 'soundtrack', 'play', 'full', 'volume', 'pretend', ""'m"", 'Christina', 'Aguilera', 'front', 'crowd', 'adoring', 'people', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'soundtrack', 'duet', 'What', 'were', 'thinking', 'How', 'could', 'not', 'combine', 'Cher', 'Christina', 'talents', 'having', 'duet', 'Shockingly', 'remiss', 'them.The', 'last', 'movie', 'saw', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'was', 'Lovely', 'Bones', 'movie', 'completely', 'different', 'characters', 'point', 'where', 'Dad', 'doubted', 'was', 'same', 'guy', ""n't"", 'have', 'major', 'role', 'film', 'apart', 'funny', 'gay', 'guy', 'who', 'brilliant', 'comedy', 'double', 'act', 'Cher', 'Did', 'mention', 'looking', 'AMAZING', 'woman', 'tender', 'years', 'only', 'quibbles', 'have', 'movie', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'running', 'time', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'just', 'random', 'character', 'thrown', 'mix', 'other', 'reason', 'interact', 'Ali', 'when', 'club', 'do', 'saucy', 'little', 'dance', 'routine', 'dancers', 'was', 'such', 'throw', 'away', 'scene', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'maybe', 'added', 'Alan', 'larking', 'around', 'one', 'singing', 'scene', 'stuck', 'extras', 'running', 'time', 'close', 'two', 'hours', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'shorter', 'still', 'not', 'lost', 'storyline', 'extras', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'meaty', 'too', 'Cut', 'dance', 'routines', 'blooper', 'reel', 'Give', 'something', 'more', 'exciting', 'please', 'movie', 'never', 'going', 'win', 'awards', 'feel', 'good', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'plenty', 'eye', 'candy', 'gentlemen', 'ladies', 'enjoy', 'So', 'drag', 'partner', 'hand', 'see', 'get', 'practising', 'dance', 'moves', 'get', 'DVD', 'clear', 'space', 'living', 'room', 'shake', 'what', 'mama', 'gave']",N/A

1300901,A3RFCBJ6U5DLFN,B002ZG976U,MisterMusicFan,"[38, 47]","`Burlesque,' the gazillion-and-sixth movie memoir of a small-town girl making it big, was expectedly lampooned by most critics upon arrival. Although several of the complaints are perfectly valid, `Burlesque' is no `Glitter.' It is in many ways a very on-the-surface visual spectacle, however, and must be treated as such throughout most of its runtime in order for enjoyment as a viewer to be possible.It is somewhat shocking that this is the movie Cher returned to the big screen for after seven years, and that this is what serves as Christina Aguilera's film debut. The story is more or less total trite, fitting snugly into the mold of the long, haggard slew of identical concepts that came before it. Christina plays Ali, a waitress from Middle-`o-Nowhere USA with her sights set on the spotlight. Somehow scrounging together the cash for a one-way ticket to LA, she happens to come across the vivacious Burlesque Lounge, and naturally lands herself a job there along with a den mother (owner of the club, Tess, played by Cher) to guide the way.There's of course also a love interest (bartender Jack, played by Cam Gigandet), who conveniently offers Ali a place to stay after her apartment is robbed, despite the existence of an out-of-town fianc&eacute;e. The premise doesn't go too far beyond that; there are the usual ethical dilemmas and opportunities to sell the soul in favor of showbiz, presented in the form of Eric Dane as weaselly businessman Marcus. Kristen Bell is mostly wasted as a one-note bitchy alcoholic rival to Ali, but Stanley Tucci musters up a few vaguely witty one-liners as Tess's stage manager and gay best friend Sean.Although the movie is heavy on the obvious, it does have some notable charms; Cher brings impressive layers of tenderness and vulnerability to her portrayal of Tess, while Xtina gives the impression she'd certainly be capable of meatier roles in the future. Cam Gigandet hasn't had much screen time in previous roles, but here we see a little more of what he can do; although he isn't given much to work with beyond the usual pretty boy waif routine, he shares a genuinely sexy, intimate scene with Christina's Ali involving some playful drunken banter and a strategically placed box of cookies.The mega-instrument that is Christina Aguilera's voice is another major factor of the film's appeal; she's a phenomenal performer, and although a few of the numbers verge on typical musical schlock, a good handful of them (including ""The Beautiful People,"" a biting, hard-edged pop number sampling Marilyn Manson's hit of the same name, as well as ""Bound To You,"" a smoky ballad) are delectable ear candy. Cher's vocals are also in top form in her soaring opening number ""Welcome To Burlesque,"" and although she unfortunately only gets one other song, she shows she's still got it and then some.Ultimately `Burlesque's biggest asset lies in its weighty guilty pleasure factor. Avid fans of Cher and Christina will probably eat it up, and there's plenty of beautiful faces, bodies, vocals and dance routines to keep things visually enticing. Likeable characters can also make or break a movie despite its script, and luckily Cher's Tess, Tucci's Sean, and a few others are charming enough to keep the audience rooting for them. If you're in the mood for a sugary confection, `Burlesque' could definitely be the way to go-just don't expect anything more filling than that.",3,"A popcorn-scratch that, kettle corn-movie",1291161600,"12 1, 2010",2010,3416,"['Burlesque', 'gazillion-and-sixth', 'movie', 'memoir', 'small-town', 'girl', 'making', 'big', 'was', 'expectedly', 'lampooned', 'most', 'critics', 'arrival', 'several', 'complaints', 'are', 'perfectly', 'valid', 'Burlesque', 'Glitter', 'many', 'ways', 'very', 'on-the-surface', 'visual', 'spectacle', 'however', 'must', 'be', 'treated', 'such', 'most', 'runtime', 'order', 'enjoyment', 'viewer', 'be', 'possible.It', 'somewhat', 'shocking', 'movie', 'Cher', 'returned', 'big', 'screen', 'seven', 'years', 'what', 'Christina', 'Aguilera', 'film', 'debut', 'story', 'more', 'less', 'total', 'trite', 'fitting', 'snugly', 'mold', 'long', 'haggard', 'slew', 'identical', 'concepts', 'came', 'Christina', 'Ali', 'waitress', 'Middle-', 'o-Nowhere', 'USA', 'sights', 'set', 'spotlight', 'Somehow', 'scrounging', 'together', 'cash', 'one-way', 'ticket', 'LA', 'come', 'vivacious', 'Burlesque', 'Lounge', 'naturally', 'job', 'there', 'along', 'den', 'mother', 'owner', 'club', 'Tess', 'played', 'Cher', 'guide', 'way.There', 'course', 'also', 'love', 'interest', 'bartender', 'Jack', 'played', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', 'who', 'conveniently', 'Ali', 'place', 'stay', 'apartment', 'robbed', 'existence', 'out-of-town', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'premise', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'far', 'are', 'usual', 'ethical', 'dilemmas', 'opportunities', 'sell', 'soul', 'favor', 'showbiz', 'presented', 'form', 'Eric', 'Dane', 'weaselly', 'businessman', 'Marcus', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'mostly', 'wasted', 'one-note', 'bitchy', 'alcoholic', 'rival', 'Ali', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'up', 'few', 'vaguely', 'witty', 'one-liners', 'Tess', 'stage', 'manager', 'gay', 'best', 'friend', 'movie', 'heavy', 'obvious', 'have', 'notable', 'charms', 'Cher', 'impressive', 'layers', 'tenderness', 'vulnerability', 'portrayal', 'Tess', 'Xtina', 'impression', ""'d"", 'certainly', 'be', 'capable', 'meatier', 'roles', 'future', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', ""n't"", 'had', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'previous', 'roles', 'here', 'see', 'little', 'more', 'what', 'can', 'do', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'work', 'usual', 'pretty', 'boy', 'waif', 'routine', 'shares', 'genuinely', 'sexy', 'intimate', 'scene', 'Christina', 'Ali', 'involving', 'playful', 'drunken', 'banter', 'strategically', 'placed', 'box', 'cookies.The', 'mega-instrument', 'Christina', 'Aguilera', 'voice', 'major', 'factor', 'film', 'appeal', 'phenomenal', 'performer', 'few', 'numbers', 'verge', 'typical', 'musical', 'schlock', 'good', 'handful', 'including', 'Beautiful', 'People', 'biting', 'hard-edged', 'pop', 'number', 'sampling', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'hit', 'same', 'name', 'as', 'well', 'Bound', 'smoky', 'ballad', 'are', 'delectable', 'ear', 'candy', 'Cher', 'vocals', 'are', 'also', 'top', 'form', 'soaring', 'opening', 'number', 'Welcome', 'Burlesque', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'song', 'still', 'got', 'then', 'some.Ultimately', 'Burlesque', 'biggest', 'asset', 'weighty', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'factor', 'Avid', 'fans', 'Cher', 'Christina', 'will', 'probably', 'eat', 'up', 'plenty', 'beautiful', 'bodies', 'vocals', 'dance', 'routines', 'keep', 'things', 'visually', 'enticing', 'Likeable', 'characters', 'can', 'also', 'make', 'break', 'movie', 'script', 'luckily', 'Cher', 'Tess', 'Tucci', 'Sean', 'few', 'others', 'are', 'charming', 'enough', 'keep', 'audience', 'rooting', ""'re"", 'mood', 'sugary', 'confection', 'Burlesque', 'could', 'definitely', 'be', 'way', 'go-just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'more', 'filling']",N/A

1300910,A392P34QSBUICZ,B002ZG976U,"Robin Landry ""singer/songwriter""","[5, 5]","I gave this film 3 stars because the singing and dancing was out of this world great.  Christina Aguilera has a voice that comes along once in a generation, and who knew that she could dance as well?  With this package I'll overlook that C rated acting skills.  As the star of this show, Christina gives it her all and that's a lot of star power.  She lights up the screen with her talent, though the writers of the script didn't give her much to work with.  Christina is a small town girl ready for the big time who seeks fame and fortune in L.A., who happens into a burlesque club owned by Cher.Now, if you've seen Coyote Ugly, you've seen this movie, so don't go looking for something new and original, but what Burlesque does give you is a feast for the eyes.  Obviously all the money that was spent on making this movie went towards the costumes, choreography, and sets, not the writers.  In fact, I would guess that writers of this movie must have been relative(s) because the characters' development and the dialogue are painfully awful.  Cher's character is tough as nails one minute, and crying like baby the next.  Christina's character is innocent one minute, and worldly-wise the next.Christina's love interest, Jack, comes off a guy who's been around the block, and as a bartender at a Burlesque club, you'd expect him to be, yet he buys Christina a drink right away, and offers to vouch for her if she needs a job reference.  Huh?  Does he do this with every attractive female who walks into the place? Or is this just lazy plotting.  In the beginning he wears enough make up to be mistaken for a drag queen, but once its established that he's not gay, and this is just for laughs, he lightens up on the eyeliner, and then stops wearing it for the rest of the movie.And for an innocent small-time girl, Christina starts off the movies stealing from her 'evil' boss, but tries to give the other waitress part of the stolen money to buy her child a bike.  Then she closes up the restaurant and sings her heart out.  So what kind of diner closes in between lunch and dinner?  None that I've ever seen.  Again, another lazy plot device so we can watch Christina sing. Again, wow, can that girl sing!I'm not sure what all the shots of Patron were about except maybe as product placement because they didn't seem to have any other reason for being.  If drinking were important to the movie, and there was one gal with a drinking problem, then just a shot glass or some stumbling around on the dance floor, could have gotten the point across just fine.I thought the movie was way too long.  Since the story was pretty much an after-thought, the writers should have just gone with the singing and dancing numbers and cut most of the dialogue out.All of the stars I gave this movie are for the singing and dancing.  Even Cher sounded better than I've ever heard her.  Both Christina and Cher are legends deserve better writers.",3,Too much formula-but amazing singing/dancing,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,2932,"['gave', 'film', '3', 'stars', 'singing', 'dancing', 'was', 'world', 'great', 'Christina', 'Aguilera', 'voice', 'along', 'once', 'generation', 'who', 'knew', 'could', 'dance', 'as', 'well', 'package', ""'ll"", 'overlook', 'C', 'rated', 'acting', 'skills', 'star', 'show', 'Christina', 'lot', 'star', 'power', 'screen', 'talent', 'writers', 'script', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'work', 'Christina', 'small', 'town', 'girl', 'ready', 'big', 'time', 'who', 'fame', 'fortune', 'L.A.', 'who', 'burlesque', 'club', 'owned', 'Cher.Now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'original', 'what', 'Burlesque', 'give', 'feast', 'eyes', 'Obviously', 'money', 'was', 'spent', 'making', 'movie', 'went', 'costumes', 'choreography', 'sets', 'not', 'writers', 'fact', 'would', 'guess', 'writers', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'relative', 'characters', 'development', 'dialogue', 'are', 'painfully', 'awful', 'Cher', 'character', 'tough', 'nails', 'one', 'minute', 'crying', 'next', 'Christina', 'character', 'innocent', 'one', 'minute', 'worldly-wise', 'next.Christina', 'love', 'interest', 'Jack', 'off', 'guy', 'who', 'been', 'block', 'bartender', 'Burlesque', 'club', ""'d"", 'expect', 'be', 'Christina', 'drink', 'right', 'away', 'vouch', 'job', 'reference', 'Huh', 'Does', 'do', 'attractive', 'female', 'who', 'place', 'just', 'lazy', 'plotting', 'beginning', 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'be', 'mistaken', 'drag', 'queen', 'once', 'established', 'not', 'gay', 'just', 'laughs', 'up', 'eyeliner', 'then', 'wearing', 'rest', 'movie.And', 'innocent', 'small-time', 'girl', 'Christina', 'movies', 'stealing', ""'evil"", 'boss', 'tries', 'give', 'other', 'waitress', 'part', 'stolen', 'money', 'buy', 'child', 'bike', 'Then', 'restaurant', 'heart', 'out', 'So', 'what', 'kind', 'diner', 'closes', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'None', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Again', 'lazy', 'plot', 'device', 'can', 'watch', 'Christina', 'sing', 'Again', 'wow', 'can', 'girl', 'sing', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'shots', 'Patron', 'were', 'about', 'except', 'maybe', 'product', 'placement', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'other', 'reason', 'being', 'drinking', 'were', 'important', 'movie', 'there', 'was', 'one', 'gal', 'drinking', 'problem', 'then', 'just', 'shot', 'glass', 'stumbling', 'around', 'dance', 'floor', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'point', 'just', 'fine.I', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'story', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'after-thought', 'writers', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'gone', 'singing', 'dancing', 'numbers', 'cut', 'most', 'dialogue', 'out.All', 'stars', 'gave', 'movie', 'are', 'singing', 'dancing', 'Even', 'Cher', 'sounded', 'better', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'Christina', 'Cher', 'are', 'deserve', 'better', 'writers']",N/A

I feel that both have great chemistry together in the screen, and were correctly chosen to star in this very good movie. Christina plays a small town woman who is determined to make it big in Hollywood, and she sees her golden ticket when spotting the burlesque club. Cher takes her under her wing and is pleasantly suprised to see the singing and dancing talent that springs forth. I love how the movie has many musical numbers and dances creatively weaved into it. In some of the scenes Christina basically sings how she is a good girl (while gyrating in some very glamorous and provocative outfits).  I mean this with both respect for Christina and Cher, but if that good girl musical number in the movie is any indicator of how she is in real-life then I would have to say that Christina probably has a wild and fun side to her good girl side as well. Cher successfully plays a self-confident mentor who helps teach her increased wisdom. The movie also includes a wonderful cast of gifted models and dancers. I also think that a good job was done in casting the actor who plays love interest of Christina Aguilera (the very handsome and talented Cam Gigandet). I felt compelled to watch the film more because of Cher starring in it, and knowing that it is a musical (I now have an interest in watching more musicals). I am very glad that I took a chance on this movie, and I am sure that many others are going to be happy too.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[7, 10]","This multi-million dollar extravaganza is primarily a vehicle for former Mouseketeer Christina Aguilera which some support from Cher - and a GREAT turn by actor Stanley Tucci. Its aimed at the ""under 30 set"" to whom ""Burlesque"" represents, not the old American theatrical art form that combined striptease with bawdy comedy routines. This is ""burlesque"" for the new (well, its not so new) millennium.Written and directed by Steven Antin (not a veteran of movie musicals), the film can't decide if it wants to tell a real story or show highly-edited fast moving song and dance numbers, nearly all with Ms. A. Obviously Antin has seen Chicago as he films some of the staged numbers in a style similar to Director Rob Marshall. The plot - as scripted by Antin - is not much different from the disaster that was called ""Showgirls"". Showgirls had lots of nudity. Basically none here. The ""partial nudity"" mentioned in the MPAA rating at the beginning is a shot of bare MALE buttocks.I mention Cabaret above for two reasons: Alan Cumming appeared in Cabaret as well as in this film and he has one number ""Jungle Berlin"" which is in the style of the musical numbers in Cabaret. It's a great number - though highly edited in the film - and one of the few scenes Cumming gets to appear in here. Like most of the production numbers, this one is chopped up with the Director cutting away to other scenes. The only song I remember seeing performed straight through is Cher's solo on ""The Last of Me"", a number which is for Cher what ""My Way"" was for Sinatra. Luckily the ""Jungle Berlin"" number - though less than two minutes long - is presented complete as one of the six ""entire song performances"" in the bonus features. The other five are a mixed bag. First is a ""dancers only"" version of a one number with a repeating vocal-backed soundtrack that really gets boring after 30 seconds. Then there is a version of Sinatra's hit ""That's Life"" performed by Cumming, in full Gene Kelly mode, that was deleted from the film. The others include - thankfully - the unedited version of the erotic ""Dr. Longjohn"". The other bonuses include a Director's commentary track, a five-minute ""blooper reel"", and a six-minute ""alternate opening"" which basically rearranges the opening song.As I noted earlier - this is the modern version of burlesque, which means sexy dancing by gorgeous women - who never take their costumes off on stage. Well, there is one ""fan dance"" by Aguilera  - exactly one hour into the film -but that's it. This is not a strip show.As a film directed to Ms. A fans - and Cher fans curious to see her again and sing that one big solo number - the film succeeds as a group of music videos. The script is banal but - thankfully - there is more singing than dialogue. Its entertaining to watch once.

In LA she is attracted to a 1920's style burlesque club. The small club puts on a large theater type show with costumes and a band. So even with the $20 cover charge, on a great night they wouldn't come close to breaking even, let alone pay the band, which is more like a small orchestra. I'm not sure why they even have a band since most of the girls lip sync. The club has a surreal appearance and the men who work there are dressed as gang characters from ""Clockwork Orange"" complete with the derby and eye make-up, although they incorrectly make-up both eyes instead of just one.Christina works as a waitress at the club and desires to be a star on this sinking ship. The star of the show is a problem child who shows up late and has an attitude. It doesn't take any imagination to figure out how this turns out. Christina belts out a few good numbers, but when she is not singing and dancing she really isn't acting. Cher does a fine job of acting and makes the rest of the crew look like a high school drama club.Cher belts one out too. This movie is set up as a ""pass the torch"" symbolism. We saw how well that worked with the Madonna/Brittney/Christina kiss-NOT!The movie is worth 5 stars on the strength of Christina's singing and Cher's acting.",5,SHOWGIRLS LIGHT,1299974400,"03 13, 2011",2011,1366,"['Christina', 'small', 'town', 'girl', 'who', 'town', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'life', 'heads', 'LA', 'credits', 'LA', 'attracted', '1920', 'style', 'burlesque', 'club', 'small', 'club', 'large', 'theater', 'type', 'show', 'costumes', 'band', 'So', 'even', '20', 'cover', 'charge', 'great', 'night', 'would', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'breaking', 'even', 'let', 'alone', 'pay', 'band', 'more', 'small', 'orchestra', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'even', 'have', 'band', 'most', 'girls', 'lip', 'sync', 'club', 'surreal', 'appearance', 'men', 'who', 'work', 'are', 'dressed', 'gang', 'characters', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'complete', 'derby', 'eye', 'make-up', 'incorrectly', 'make-up', 'eyes', 'instead', 'just', 'one.Christina', 'works', 'waitress', 'club', 'desires', 'be', 'star', 'sinking', 'ship', 'star', 'show', 'problem', 'child', 'who', 'up', 'late', 'attitude', ""n't"", 'take', 'imagination', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'out', 'Christina', 'belts', 'out', 'few', 'good', 'numbers', 'when', 'not', 'singing', 'dancing', 'really', ""n't"", 'acting', 'Cher', 'fine', 'job', 'acting', 'rest', 'crew', 'look', 'high', 'school', 'drama', 'club.Cher', 'belts', 'one', 'too', 'movie', 'set', 'up', 'pass', 'torch', 'symbolism', 'saw', 'how', 'well', 'worked', 'Madonna/Brittney/Christina', 'kiss-NOT', 'movie', 'worth', '5', 'stars', 'strength', 'Christina', 'singing', 'Cher', 'acting']",N/A

I was pleasantly surprised when we watched this for the first time.  The story is plausible, the acting is pretty decent and the music is fun.  It is basically a musical without the cheesy... dialogue turns into a music montage type scenes.  I was also pleasantly surprised at the lack of nudity.
