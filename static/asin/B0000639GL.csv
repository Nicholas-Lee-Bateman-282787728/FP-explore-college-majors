694279,A1NPNGWBVD9AK3,B0000639GL,"Bruce Kendall ""BEK""","[38, 42]","This play revival marks the pinnacle of several noteworthy careers. Jose Quintero has made a reputation, in part, as his generation's foremost interpreter of O'Neill. Colleen Dewhurst was one of the great stage actresses of her time. Those aware of the history of the American Stage, know about Jason Robards' credentials when it comes to nailing down an O'Neill character. Throw in Hal Holbrooke for good measure, in ostensibly his finest stage performance apart from Mark Twain Tonight, and you've got a harmonic convergence of the highest order.For those who were not lucky enough to watch the magic unfold on stage, this video will have to suffice. Though it suffers from the same limitations as other filmed versions of staged performances, it is nevertheless a record to be treasured by lovers of O'Neill, theatre fans, and connisseurs of great acting and directing everywhere and always.Those of us who had the pleasure to know Jason Robards, know how close the actor's own past paralleled that of the character he portrayed in this play (James Tyrone, Jr.). Like Tyrone, Robards fought with his alcoholic demons. In his last decades, he conquered his disease, with the help of a strong, loving, Irish-American wife. Robards threw himself exhaustingly, night after night into this role, as did Dewhurst. The result was an evening of true catharsis, in the strict Greek sense of the word, for actors and audience. As Dewhurst cradles Robards in her pieta-like embrace and the lights fade out at the end of the play, we know we have all been changed by a profound confluence of talent and tears.",5,Theatrical Experience of the Decade?,1026086400,"07 8, 2002",2002,1600,"['play', 'revival', 'pinnacle', 'several', 'noteworthy', 'careers', 'Jose', 'Quintero', 'made', 'reputation', 'part', 'generation', 'foremost', 'interpreter', ""O'Neill"", 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'stage', 'actresses', 'time', 'aware', 'history', 'American', 'Stage', 'know', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'credentials', 'when', 'nailing', 'down', ""O'Neill"", 'character', 'Throw', 'Hal', 'Holbrooke', 'good', 'measure', 'ostensibly', 'finest', 'stage', 'performance', 'apart', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'Tonight', ""'ve"", 'got', 'harmonic', 'convergence', 'highest', 'order.For', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'lucky', 'enough', 'watch', 'magic', 'unfold', 'stage', 'video', 'will', 'have', 'suffice', 'same', 'limitations', 'other', 'filmed', 'versions', 'staged', 'performances', 'nevertheless', 'record', 'be', 'treasured', 'lovers', ""O'Neill"", 'theatre', 'fans', 'connisseurs', 'great', 'acting', 'directing', 'everywhere', 'always.Those', 'who', 'had', 'pleasure', 'know', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'know', 'how', 'close', 'actor', 'own', 'past', 'paralleled', 'character', 'portrayed', 'play', 'James', 'Tyrone', 'Jr.', 'Tyrone', 'Robards', 'fought', 'alcoholic', 'demons', 'last', 'decades', 'conquered', 'disease', 'help', 'strong', 'loving', 'Irish-American', 'wife', 'Robards', 'threw', 'exhaustingly', 'night', 'night', 'role', 'did', 'Dewhurst', 'result', 'was', 'evening', 'true', 'catharsis', 'strict', 'Greek', 'sense', 'word', 'actors', 'audience', 'Dewhurst', 'Robards', 'pieta-like', 'embrace', 'lights', 'fade', 'out', 'end', 'play', 'know', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'profound', 'confluence', 'talent', 'tears']",A Moon for the Misbegotten

694282,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B0000639GL,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[6, 6]","The bulk of Eugene O'Neill's work was done between about 1914 and 1933, a period which saw him win Pulitzer Prizes for Beyond the Horizon, Anna Christie, and Strange Interlude as well as create such landmark plays as The Emperor Jones, The Hairy Ape, Desire Under the Elms, The Great God Brown, and Mourning Becomes Electra. But around 1933 O'Neill--who struggled against a host of personal demons--went silent. Although he received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1936, most felt that he was burned out, written out, and that his career was over.In 1947 O'Neill allowed the performance of a new work, A Moon for the Misbegotten, in Columbus, Ohio. Major critics did not exactly fall over themselves to see it and the reports that did leak through were not positive. The play was withdrawn and forgotten and O'Neill died in 1953. At that point, however, it became known that he had written several during the 1930s and 1940s that he had never released, his will specifying that they could not be performed until after his death. The treasure trove included two of his greatest works: The Iceman Commeth and Long Day's Journey Into Night, the latter of which was a painfully realistic portrait of his family and which won O'Neill yet another Pulitizer Prize. These plays prompted a renewed interest in O'Neill's work, and in 1957 A Moon For The Misbegotten at last opened on Broadway--where, in spite of a memorable cast that included Franchot Tone and Wendy Hiller--it was a mighty flop, playing a grand total of sixty-eight performances. Even so, the play had its champions, and a British televison production and a successful 1960s off-Broadway revival eventually led to a 1973 Broadway revival, directed by Jose Quintero and starring Collen Dewhurst, Jason Robards, and Ed Flanders. The production ran for 313 performances, won a Tony for Dewhurst, and proved the worth of the play.In 1975 the cast reunited to perform the play as a television production. Although there were changes in camera angle, real horses, real pigs in the pig pen, and and a few minor set changes, it was presented very much as a play; there was no effort to ""open up"" the script and translate it into a motion picture vocabulary. Such a style of presentation is inevitably somewhat static, but between O'Neill's script, the performances, and the overall interpretation, A Moon for The Misbegotten was one of the most widely discussed television productions of its year, and it remains as fascinating today as it was thirty years ago.Long Day's Journey Into Night had painted a portrait of O'Neill's brother as a hopeless, embittered alcoholic struggling to survive his father's boorishness and his mother's drug addiction. A Moon for the Misbegotten might be thought of as sequel, for it presents the same character, Jamie Tyrone, after his mother's death from drugs and as he continues his own descent into an alcoholic hell. The play presents Jamie (Jason Robards) as owner of a farm, which he rents to Phil Hogan (Ed Flanders), an Irishman and a drunk whose thirst equals Jamie's. The only one of his children remaining on the farm is Hogan's daughter Josie (Colleen Dewhurst), a tall and broad woman whose many affairs have given her the reputation of a slut--a reputation that Jamie does not believe. Although both deny any romantic or sexual interest in the other, both Jamie and Josie have an eye for each other, but it is difficult to know how deep their feelings for each other run.Jamie has promised to sell the farm to Hogan, but an unexpected turn of events has led one of the farm's neighbors to offer an outrageous sum of money for the property. Given Jamie's financial pains, it seems likely that he will sell the farm out from under Hogan and Josie--and so Josie, in a fit of anger, makes up a plot to entice Jamie into her bed and thereafter blackmail into selling the farm to her father after all. But when the very drunken Jamie arrives in the night to meet Josie, what actually occurs is a series of personal and painful revelations that jolt both into deeply felt pathos. Unlike some O'Neill plays, which conclude on a note of stark tragedy, A Moon For The Misbegotten is more open-ended, less sure--but even so the ending implies little good to come.At this time Jason Robards was considered the great interpreter of O'Neill's work, having already appeared in The Iceman Cometh and Long Day's Journey Into Night, and he gives an excellent performance here; so too does Ed Flanders. But the central figure of the play is Josie Hogart, and Colleen Dewhurst is not only up the challenge of a very difficult role, she essentially walks away with the entire show. One easily understands why she was considered one of the great stage actresses of her era and why she won a Tony Award for this particular role; she is by turns brash and pitiful, loveable and infuriating, and while many an actor has struggled with O'Neill's lines she carries them with tremendous grace and ease. It is a magnificent showing.The DVD offers the original telecast in good condition, with the video and sound elements well preserved. There are, unfortunately, little in the way of extras. But the play's the thing, as Shakespeare himself said, and extras or no extras, Moon For The Misbegotten is truly something to see. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",5,"""I'm just a rough, ugly cow of a woman--but I can still do better than a sniveling wreck like Jime Tyrone!""",1317859200,"10 6, 2011",2011,5338,"['bulk',

First produced on Broadway in 1958, the play was originally dismissed as second-rate O'Neill. It took the powerhouse 1974 revival directed by Jose Quintero and starring Jason Robards, Colleen Dewhurst and Ed Flanders to finally earn O'Neill's painful reminiscence about his brother Jamie, unforgettably introduced to audiences in &quot;Long Days Journey Into Night,&quot; the deserved accolade of &quot;masterpiece.&quot;The story is incidental: dirt farmers Josie and her father attempt to dupe their alcoholic landlord James Tyrone, Jr. into spending the night with Josie in the hopes of initiating a vague stab at retaliation against a scheme that Tyrone has hatched against him. But when the drunken lessor shows up for the assignation, what unfolds is a series of jolting revelations that leaves all of the characters - and the audience - emotionally spent, with only a lingering sense of compassion haunting their well-traveled spirits.This DVD is the ABC television production of this landmark theatrical event, and admirers of great acting can only be thankful that the production was preserved on video.
