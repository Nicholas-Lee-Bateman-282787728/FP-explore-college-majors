Don't listen to others, this one is just as good as the first one!This is the typical story of the black man against the Italian-American(black blood is on them also..) for control of the ghetto.  This one is good because it takes a look into black people with money in the early 70's.  This film has action, sex, story, chases and a mob boss who doe snot mind you talking sh*t to him, but touch his food or matrial items and he is pissed!If you like black exploitation films or if you are white and you like raw action films, get this.  Shaft is Africa was a little different(could be why they never made another), but still ok.

With star Richard Roundtree and director Gordon Parks returning they've upped the ante here.  Roundtree feels more at home in his leather and turtlenecks and he's been blessed with a better story that involves him manipulating different mob factions with a cache of money thrown into the mix.  The flick concludes with a terrifically conceived chase scene that involves fast cars, speedboats, and helicopters that'll keep you on the edge of your seat.

Richard Roundtree reprises his role as the tough, sexy private eye who manages to make the ladies swoon and the gangsters look for ways to eliminate him once and for all. The action scenes are good but the final chase sequence, while entertaining, drags on a bit too long and runs out of steam before the explosive ending. O.C.

You can't beat The Theme From Shaft, but Big Score has got some tight music in it, keepin' it funky for the Private Dick whose a brotha man. Bumpy and Willie, my two favorite characters are back, and Bumpy is still tolerating Shaft while Bumpy maintains his hilarious disrepecting of him. About midway through is one of coolest scenes ever-Shaft is getting worked over backstage at a nightclub by Mob goons while the shots cut back and forth between busted jaws and writhing exotic dancers.

During Shaft's investigation, he once again crosses paths with Bumpy Jones, the Harlem mob boss from the first  film, as well as another ganster, Gus Mascola. Again Shaft begins to play  all sides against each other, in order for him to get what he wants,  revenge, and a big chunk of change! This film was rushed into production to  cap on the success of the first film, and the hurried production shows in  the film. The plot is kinda weak, and the classic dialogue from the  superior predecessor is sorely missed.

117430,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,0790746689,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 7]","Because of the success of the original ""Shaft,"" MGM upgraded the series, giving more action scenes and less nudity; so this time Shaft in the opening credits drives a car in the midnight New York while in the previous film he was walking down the street.The basic of the story is not particuarly original.  It is about the missing money from the safe of Shaft's friend and insurance broker.  As Shaft starts his investigation, a crime  syndicate is looking for the money while it tries to kill him, but of course, it's a very, very wrong idea.  Our Shaft, keeping the police and Bumpy (Moses Gunn re-appearing from the original) at bay, gets what he wants, as always!Gordon Parks (who had a long remarkable career as  photographer, and himself appearing as a croupier here) demonstrates he is also good at presenting impressive action scenes, especially the chase scenes at the end of the film.  However, by the today's standard, they might look too long and stretched.  Actually, the stunts themselves are impressive, but if the editing had been tighter, they would be much better.Richard Roundtree looks as sexy as ever, and entertains us with his suave way of talking to girls.  Other characters are drawn better than original ""Shaft.""  Charismatic Julius W Harris is cast effectively as a detective, and the idea of clarinet-playing gangster is interesting.  And Drew Bundini Brown's Willy is a standout.  The movie is a  satisfactory, if not perfect, action thriller.",3,Shaft Is Back !!
