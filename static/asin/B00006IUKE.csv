717396,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B00006IUKE,Bobby Underwood,"[3, 4]","""I can be your diary for awhile. Your talking diary.""This love story from Korea has the tenderness of snowflakes carried gently from the heavens on a soft winter breeze. From its sepia hued opening to its final shot, this film will gently squeeze your heart until you feel the ache of love which remains even after we are gone, as does its scent. Filled with moments of great romantic beauty and heartbreaking sadness, its complex story told with a simple grace and elegance, it makes my personal list of all-time favorites.Kim Ha Neul is endearing as Soeun, a shy college student in love with classmate Donghee. Their story of slowly getting together has a sweet innocence which is in contrast to the story of IN (Yoo Ji Tae) and his girlfriend. She is brash and quarrelsome, and is worried she may be an alcoholic. But underneath there is a yet untapped depth which will flourish near the end of this story.Souen's life in college consists of going to see her her best friend, Sumi, in the hospital with a broken leg, and talking to an unexpected voice in the night, from a HAM radio given her by another student. It was not supposed to be in working order, yet she and IN begin to talk, at first in contentious manner, he thinking she is joking with him about attending the same college nearly 20 years earlier. Much to his girlfriend's displeasure, he makes arrangements to meet Souen.Both think they were stood up, until her sincerity about current events leads him to give her news of future happenings, and both realize they are living in different times. Whereas most films would use this as a device to propel their love story, director Jeung Gueon Kin and photographer Kwang Suck Jung take this in an entirely different direction. The two come to care for each other, IN becoming her diary for her fledging romance with Donghee, while he wrestles with his girlfriend's drinking and initial disbelief at what he's telling her is happening.His sudden realization that his parents are attending college with her leads to a romantically heartbreaking bit of information which changes both their lives forever. It also changes his girlfriend's mind about what has been happening, and she decides to support IN. In an emotionally wrenching scene, he discovers the scent still remains. To reveal anything further would ruin the experience for those who have yet to see this piece of film magic.It begins slowly, and in such a simple manner, you do not expect the touching depth finally revealed. The two most wonderful things about this film are Kim Ha Neul's lovely performance, and the hauntingly beautiful score which helps set the unique atmosphere of a film which takes part of your heart with it, but gives more back. A very special film so heartfelt words cannot adequately describe its effect on the moviegoer. A must own film for anyone with a heart.",5,"""I let go of him from my heart...""",1221955200,"09 21, 2008",2008,2862,"['can', 'be', 'diary', 'awhile', 'talking', 'diary', 'love', 'story', 'Korea', 'tenderness', 'snowflakes', 'carried', 'gently', 'heavens', 'soft', 'winter', 'breeze', 'sepia', 'hued', 'opening', 'final', 'shot', 'film', 'will', 'gently', 'squeeze', 'heart', 'feel', 'ache', 'love', 'even', 'are', 'gone', 'scent', 'Filled', 'moments', 'great', 'romantic', 'beauty', 'heartbreaking', 'sadness', 'complex', 'story', 'told', 'simple', 'grace', 'elegance', 'personal', 'list', 'all-time', 'favorites.Kim', 'Ha', 'Neul', 'endearing', 'Soeun', 'shy', 'college', 'student', 'love', 'classmate', 'Donghee', 'story', 'slowly', 'getting', 'together', 'sweet', 'innocence', 'contrast', 'story', 'IN', 'Yoo', 'Ji', 'Tae', 'girlfriend', 'brash', 'quarrelsome', 'worried', 'may', 'be', 'alcoholic', 'yet', 'untapped', 'depth', 'will', 'flourish', 'end', 'story.Souen', 'life', 'college', 'consists', 'going', 'see', 'best', 'friend', 'Sumi', 'hospital', 'broken', 'leg', 'talking', 'unexpected', 'voice', 'night', 'HAM', 'radio', 'given', 'student', 'was', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'working', 'order', 'IN', 'begin', 'talk', 'first', 'contentious', 'manner', 'thinking', 'joking', 'attending', 'same', 'college', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'earlier', 'Much', 'girlfriend', 'displeasure', 'arrangements', 'meet', 'Souen.Both', 'think', 'were', 'stood', 'up', 'sincerity', 'current', 'events', 'give', 'news', 'future', 'happenings', 'realize', 'are', 'living', 'different', 'times', 'Whereas', 'most', 'films', 'would', 'use', 'device', 'propel', 'love', 'story', 'director', 'Jeung', 'Gueon', 'Kin', 'photographer', 'Kwang', 'Suck', 'Jung', 'take', 'entirely', 'different', 'direction', 'two', 'come', 'care', 'other', 'IN', 'becoming', 'diary', 'fledging', 'romance', 'Donghee', 'girlfriend', 'drinking', 'initial', 'disbelief', 'what', 'telling', 'happening.His', 'sudden', 'realization', 'parents', 'are', 'attending', 'college', 'leads', 'romantically', 'heartbreaking', 'bit', 'information', 'lives', 'forever', 'also', 'girlfriend', 'mind', 'what', 'been', 'happening', 'support', 'IN', 'emotionally', 'wrenching', 'scene', 'scent', 'still', 'reveal', 'anything', 'further', 'would', 'ruin', 'experience', 'who', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'piece', 'film', 'magic.It', 'slowly', 'such', 'simple', 'manner', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'touching', 'depth', 'finally', 'revealed', 'two', 'most', 'wonderful', 'things', 'film', 'are', 'Kim', 'Ha', 'Neul', 'lovely', 'performance', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'score', 'set', 'unique', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'part', 'heart', 'more', 'back', 'very', 'special', 'film', 'so', 'heartfelt', 'words', 'can', 'not', 'adequately', 'describe', 'effect', 'moviegoer', 'must', 'own', 'film', 'anyone', 'heart']",Ditto

In Ditto, I was just so focused, I didn't want anyone to disrupt my viewing. Ditto was very moving and sweet. Soeun (main girl) is so purrrdy (Her smile's the best). I only wished that somewhere toward the end, the 2 main characters would've somehow met magically (like how the HAM radio 'magically' worked unplugged) and lived happily ever after or when IN (the guy) passed by Soeun at the university in 2000, that there would've been even more than the deep stares. Actually the staring was kind of romantic, yet bitter-sweet. I think if would've been sooo interesting if IN would've starting speaking as if to the HAM right when Soeun passed him by...

Even when I read a synopsis to refresh my memory, no visuals came to mind.If I live another 20 years, I won't forget DITTO. Released one month after FREQUENCY with the same plot device (a ham radio connection across time), DITTO did everything right. It had one utterly stunning moment. And, as usual, the Korean film is visually superior to the Hollywood film.In this one, the ham radio operators are a young college man and woman living 20 years apart. Unlike FREQUENCY which carelessly messes with past events and uses action to try to keep the audience awake, this film gently explores the respective love lives. The characters and their interactions have depth enuf to seem real in spite of the scifi premise. The imaginative powers behind this film can be seen in a single scene where an entire thread of the plot is revealed in a short series of photographs.The lead actress, Kim Ha Neul, isn't the prettiest actress but she builds a quietly powerful performance of subtle nuances that thoroughly won me over. The lead actor, Yu Ji Tae, is almost her equal (and is tall enuf to play pro basketball). Pretty Ha Ji Won, in a supporting role in her second film, is competent, and is made up to look really cute.I should perhaps warn you that the ham radio portion starts a short while into the film. Be patient cuz that prologue pays off. My only real regret is the sometimes overwhelming piano background music.BTW, another Korean film, SIWORAE (aka,IL MARE), would be released later that year. It would use a mail box to connect two people across 2 years of time -- and would be remade asTHE LAKE HOUSEin 2006.

Into the first half hour of the movie or so I thought it was okay but the more it progress the better it became. The story revolves around the relationship that develops between two college students, So-eun (Kim Ha-neul) and In (Yoo Ji-tae of ""Attack the Gas Station!""), who connect via a ham radio one night. However, when they decide to meet on campus and miss each other, it is revealed that they are separated by 21 years, with So-eun in 1979 and In living in the present day, 2000. Eventually, they become comfortable with the supernatural phenomenon that has brought them together, as well as their correspondence. She relates her camaraderie with her best friend Seon-mi (Kim Min-ju) and her pining for fellow student Dong-heui (Park Yong-woo); while he talks about the unwanted attention he receives from fellow co-ed (Ha Ji-weon). However, as the on-air relationship deepens, it is revealed that their ties go far deeper than ever imagined.True, the plot of ""Ditto"" is eerily similar to a Hollywood production released that same year, ""Frequency"", in which a young man is able to communicate with his late firefighter father through a ham radio. However, there is a difference between the two films with respect to intent. Whereas ""Frequency"" was more-or-less a sci-fi suspense-thriller, ""Ditto"" ends up being a bittersweet drama that offers up some interesting perspectives on the national psyche of South Korea.To appreciate the significance of the two timelines in ""Ditto"", 1979 and 2000, one needs to be familiar with the history of South Korea, a relatively young democracy with a turbulent past. The South Korean people made the painful transition from one political extreme to the other in the span of a single generation; it is not surprising that the country's filmmakers have been influenced by such upheaval. Underlying the 'love across time' genre is the dichotomy between the lessons of the past and the understanding of the present, not unlike the themes addressed in the films of Wong Kar-wai (""In the Mood for Love""). All the characters in the genre's films struggle with trying to make sense of events in their past, often catastrophic, and using that knowledge to better understand themselves and their current circumstances.Melancholy and humor were balanced out with the innocence of the female characters; it never got overly heavy with sadness. ""Ditto"", along with the other films of the Korean 'love across time' genre, is a thoughtful reflection of the national psyche of South Korea, a country that has matured into a functioning democracy in a relatively short time, yet still bears the scars of that long and difficult struggle.
