The Harpies look ridiculous and just stand and squat hissing and waving hands with long fingernails.  Their teeth are all long and hang a inch or two below their lower lip - they couldn't open their mouths to eat.  They are really phoney looking and don't look threatening at all.  The swordfights are really bad, don't look real.  It is a bad movie.  Even if they meant it to be campy they didn't succeed. This is a D or lower movie.

The costumes also silly, especially when you consider that the characters almost never changed costume! The harpies were pathetic: a child would not have been afraid. So why a two? I guess because there is a small chance the makers were going for camp, and if so, they moderately achieved it.",2,The harpies were pathetic: a child would not have been afraid,1405468800,"07 16, 2014",2014,356,"['Giving', 'movie', '2', 'was', 'bit', 'charitable', 'plot', 'was', 'silly', 'costumes', 'also', 'silly', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'characters', 'almost', 'never', 'changed', 'costume', 'harpies', 'were', 'pathetic', 'child', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'afraid', 'So', 'why', 'two', 'guess', 'small', 'chance', 'makers', 'were', 'going', 'camp', 'so', 'moderately', 'achieved']",HARPIES
1695569,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B00J5G1NI8,Einsatz,"[2, 2]","This is a 2007 Sci-Fi Channel movie that apparently no one wants to take credit for (the DVD cover is bereft of any information regarding this film).  It stars Stephen Baldwin as a disgraced cop now working as a guard for a museum.  The bad guy, in a dual role, is Scott Valentine.  I think they were trying to make a comedy of this, not unlike Army of Darkness.  Baldwin's character is sent back in time through a vortex, he makes an inauspicious landing in a pig sty.  Since he has all his modern day weapons (and a magic amulet), he's deemed the chosen one sent to battle the harpies and their master the evil Vorian (played in typical fashion as a cackling loony by Scott Valentine).  I'm almost ashamed to admit that I did laugh a couple of times but I'm not certain I was meant to.  This is a very low budget production.  Half the time the characters couldn't remember to use their accents, the rest of the time they slipped into colloquial jargon that made no sense for that time period.  The dialog wasn't funny (if indeed it was meant to be).  The acting was cringe worthy on everyone's part.  Cheap sets, cheap costumes, they didn't waste any of their budget on the production design.  I don't know what their intention was but the results are a sad coalition of incompetence.In the realm of ""it's so bad it's good,"" this film is just plain awful.",2,"""Jason, you can't point your gun at me anymore.""",1403827200,"06 27, 2014",2014,1357,"['2007', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'movie', 'apparently', 'one', 'take', 'credit', 'DVD', 'cover', 'bereft', 'information', 'regarding', 'film', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'disgraced', 'cop', 'now', 'working', 'guard', 'museum', 'bad', 'guy', 'dual', 'role', 'Scott', 'Valentine', 'think', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'comedy', 'not', 'Army', 'Darkness', 'Baldwin', 'character', 'sent', 'back', 'time', 'vortex', 'inauspicious', 'landing', 'pig', 'sty', 'modern', 'day', 'weapons', 'magic', 'amulet', 'deemed', 'chosen', 'one', 'sent', 'battle', 'harpies', 'master', 'evil', 'Vorian', 'played', 'typical', 'fashion', 'cackling', 'loony', 'Scott', 'Valentine', ""'m"", 'almost', 'ashamed', 'admit', 'did', 'couple', 'times', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'was', 'meant', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'production', 'time', 'characters', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'use', 'accents', 'rest', 'time', 'slipped', 'colloquial', 'jargon', 'made', 'sense', 'time', 'period', 'dialog', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'indeed', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'acting', 'was', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'everyone', 'part', 'Cheap', 'sets', 'cheap', 'costumes', 'did', ""n't"", 'waste', 'budget', 'production', 'design', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'intention', 'was', 'results', 'are', 'sad', 'coalition', 'incompetence.In', 'realm', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'film', 'just', 'plain', 'awful']",HARPIES

Somehow the lack of production value and the stupefied performances were supposed to make this into a comedy. There was nothing funny about it. From the lack luster effects to the nonexistent sets to the tragically witless script, the director started with a steaming  pile of it. And that was what he cooked up and served. The only thing missing was a side order of dead rats to choke down with and extra large mud milk shake. I like low budget movies. I like monster movies. There is nothing more monstrous than bad film making disguised as comedy. I suppose a really hateful teacher could inflict this on a class as to how NOT to write, direct, or act, in a movie.
