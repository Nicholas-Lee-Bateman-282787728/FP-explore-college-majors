1354068,A1D2LB4Z5RMO4M,B003M986TI,Amanda Pike,"[52, 59]","I finally was able to see the 2009 version of Dorian Gray, adapted from the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde.I am writing this review AS an Oscar Wilde fan. I have read The Picture of Dorian Gray twice and I have read The Canterville Ghost twice.I am going to tell you right now that these negative reviews that claim that this film is an insult to Oscar Wilde are WRONG! It's as if people who know very little about the works of Oscar Wilde are following a trend.Those that say this would make Oscar Wilde roll over in his grave clearly have never seen the dreadful mid 2000s version of The Picture of Dorian Gray that re-sets it in the 1960s with a female Basil with horrendous acting. And they clearly have never seen the 1940s version of The Canterville Ghost that turned the entire story into World War 2 propaganda about a solider having to prove himself against a Nazi.I will admit that this not a word for word faithful adaptation of the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray however it is very true to the heart of the novel, the meaning and purpose. The character portrayals are perfect and accurate. All changes are purely superficial. I know Ben Barnes as Dorian does not resemble the character of the novel however he does resemble Oscar Wilde himself and since Oscar Wilde saw himself in Dorian I felt this was a brilliant use of visual symbolism in Wilde's own relationship with Dorian Gray.I know that some people have complained about the adding of the character Emily Wotton, whom does not exist in the novel. What people fail to remember is that nearly all film versions of The Picture of Dorian Gray have this 'redeemer' character. In the 1940s movie her name was Gladys. In the 1973 version of The Picture of Dorian Gray her name was Beatrice. In most versions she's Basil's niece or daughter but in this version she was Lord Henry's daughter.What many don't know is that this character does exist in the novel. She's mentioned briefly near the end as a country girl named Hetty. Her part in the novel isn't as big as in the film adaptations but she does still exist and she works to add sympathy to Dorian's character.You cannot see the inner workings of Dorian's mind in a physical medium like films or plays as you do with the novel so you you need a new way to see his moral struggle. And this is done through the presence of Emily.Collin Firth was incredible as Lord Henry. That was the best portrayal of Lord Henry since George Sanders.  When he says 'People die by common sense.' he fully became Lord Henry for me.  Most people treat the role too academically and sound like they're boredly reading from a book.  Collin Firth however really got it.  He really understood the character.  This version of The Picture of Dorian Gray has more of Oscar Wilde's witty epigrams than any other version before it. The only line missing that I wish was in here is Lord Henry gives Dorian a cigarette case. In this one it's just inscribed with Dorian's name. In the novel it reads 'The World has changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curve of your lips re-write history.'The only character of the film I did not like was this version of Sibyl Vane. In this version Dorian seduces her into sleeping with him before marriage (as he does in the original film with Angela Lansbury in the role).When Sibyl starts talking about having a family Dorian argues that it is too soon, much thanks to the ideas planted in his head by Lord Henry. When this Sibyl kills herself it gets revealed that she was with child. This takes away from her sympathy. It's true having a child out of wed lock was frowned upon in the Victorian era but it did happen. And it did not mean the end of the world. Look at the character of Fantine in Les Miserables. It was selfish of this Sibyl to kill herself because she did not just kill herself, she killed herself and the unborn baby that she seemed so eager to have only a few scenes earlier.  It looked almost as if the suicide was out of spite.Sibyl does kill herself in the earlier incarnations but at least she had never done it while carrying a baby and knowing she was carrying the baby, and having wanted to raise the child. It's hard to sympathize with this version of Sibyl, especially since you know her brother Jim would have taken care of both her and the baby if not Dorian.Basil, however, was very sympathetic. One thing I'm glad they cut was that in most versions Basil didn't just disapprove of Dorian's relationship with Sibyl out of jealousy, he also had told him not to marry beneath his class. Basil doesn't do that in this version. Basil is the most sympathetic of Dorian's Victims in this film.Dorian himself is played exceptionally well though my favourite character portrayal in this version is Lord Henry. Dorian goes from ruthless and cruel to sympathetic and tragic in a heartbeat. The struggle is perfect. You can see his conscience, and not just with the painting. He is fighting against his own darker instincts which adds to making him sympathetic.As a true Oscar Wilde fan I feel they captured the spirit of Oscar Wilde's intent. This was the best version of The Picture of Dorian Gray I have ever seen, the black and white version coming in close second for having the better and more innocent version of Sibyl Vane.I am in America and we never got a theatrical release of this version of Dorian Gray.  This film is truly good, truly exceptional, and, if you want to watch any film about a young looking immortal, this is far more intelligent, interesting and just plain better than the Twilight Saga.",5,Brilliant version of Dorian Gray,1278633600,"07 9, 2010",2010,5597,"['finally', 'was', 'able', 'see', '2009', 'version', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'adapted', 'novel', 'Picture', 'Dorian', 'Gray',

I never had a single expectation from the film initially as I wasn't really familiar with the novel, somehow the film managed to surprise me almost every single moment, I realized it was one of those films that completely grabs you mentally and all you care about, are the characters. Well, what makes the film a gem? a fantastic direction from Oliver Parker and an outstanding performance from the lead guy Ben Barnes, Barnes manages to steal the show quite easily right from the very start, his performance as 'Dorian' can be said 'Impeccable' in just a word, all you can think is that he was simply destined to play 'Dorian Gray', ever bit of his emotion, from his innocence, his youthful lust to his inner psychological fears will grab your soul. The rest of the cast is brilliant and above all Colin Firth is terrific, a similarly good performance by Ben Affleck.  A dark atmosphere to the rich character development is what you will find here.

The title of the book is The Picture of Dorian Gray and is about a very handsome young english gentlemen who comes from a wealthy family.  He is having his portrait painted and while posing listens to the ravings of the artist's friend.  The friend is a Libertine at heart and freightens Dorian into selling his soul to remain youthful forever, while his portrait ages and takes on the ugliness of one who lives a life of Libertinage. Taking the advise of this Libertine Man, Dorian does follow a path of indulgence and decadence.  He becomes mad a he seeks to feed his insatiable appetite for everything. Eventually his concience catches up with him and... Well, I will leave that for you to find out.I love this movie -not only because we get to see Ben Barnes almost totally naked, but because I think it really captures where Oscar Wilde was going with this story. Ole Oscar was no stranger to the variety of sexual pleasure, but had he written what I think he really wanted to write in Queen Victoria's England, he would have been executed instead of being sentenced to hard labor. I think that he would approve of this fantastic rendition of his book.  In this movie you really get to see how far Dorian Gray went with his immortality.  Yes ladies and gentlemen, he was involved in sexual orgies with men and women.  Hey, if i were immortal I would do the same, why limit yourself when you have money and eternal life and eternal youth and beauty.  I need to find someone to paint my portrait.NE WAY, great cast, as I mentioned the beautiful Ben Barnes (Prince Caspian, and Stardust), the fabulous Colin Firth (Valmont, The Single Man, Bridget Jones' Dairy 1& 2, the list is too long for this great British actor),Ben Chaplin (The Truth About Cats and Dogs, Lost Souls, Murder By Numbers and The Water Horse) and Rachel Hurd-Wood (Peter Pan, and An American Haunting).Please forgive my mispellings and typos, I am writing this while watching the New Season of THE BIG BANG THEORY.",5,Oscar Wilde LIVES!!!!,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",2010,2050,"['love', 'story', 'written', 'Victorian', 'Age', 'author', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'title', 'book', 'Picture', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'very', 'handsome', 'young', 'english', 'gentlemen', 'who', 'wealthy', 'family', 'having', 'portrait', 'painted', 'posing', 'listens', 'ravings', 'artist', 'friend', 'friend', 'Libertine', 'heart', 'freightens', 'Dorian', 'selling', 'soul', 'remain', 'youthful', 'forever', 'portrait', 'ages', 'ugliness', 'one', 'who', 'life', 'Libertinage', 'Taking', 'advise', 'Libertine', 'Man', 'Dorian', 'follow', 'path', 'indulgence', 'decadence', 'mad', 'feed', 'insatiable', 'appetite', 'everything', 'Eventually', 'concience', 'up', 'Well', 'will', 'leave', 'find', 'out.I', 'love', 'movie', 'only', 'get', 'see', 'Ben', 'Barnes', 'almost', 'totally', 'naked', 'think', 'really', 'where', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'was', 'going', 'story', 'Ole', 'Oscar', 'was', 'stranger', 'variety', 'sexual', 'pleasure', 'had', 'written', 'what', 'think', 'really', 'wanted', 'write', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'England', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'executed', 'instead', 'being', 'sentenced', 'hard', 'labor', 'think', 'would', 'approve', 'fantastic', 'rendition', 'book', 'movie', 'really', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'went', 'immortality', 'ladies', 'gentlemen', 'was', 'involved', 'sexual', 'orgies', 'men', 'women', 'Hey', 'i', 'were', 'immortal', 'would', 'do', 'same', 'why', 'limit', 'when', 'have', 'money', 'eternal', 'life', 'eternal', 'youth', 'beauty', 'need', 'find', 'someone', 'paint', 'portrait.NE', 'WAY', 'great', 'cast', 'mentioned', 'beautiful', 'Ben', 'Barnes', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'Stardust', 'fabulous', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Valmont', 'Single', 'Man', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Dairy', '1', '2', 'list', 'too', 'long', 'great', 'British', 'actor', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'Truth', 'Cats', 'Dogs', 'Lost', 'Souls', 'Murder', 'Numbers', 'Water', 'Horse', 'Rachel', 'Hurd-Wood', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'American', 'Haunting', '.Please', 'forgive', 'mispellings', 'typos', 'am', 'writing', 'watching', 'New', 'Season', 'THE', 'BIG', 'BANG', 'THEORY']",N/A

Erland,"[0, 1]","The 2009 release `Dorian Gray' starring Ben Barnes is a classic Faustian style tale offering the viewer the perfect blend of stellar production values, an attractive and talented British cast along with a deliciously decadent gothic horror that will both attract and repulse the audience at every turn. As far as looks go, one need not look no further than Ben Barnes in the lead role as Dorian Gray. However thankfully he does deliver more than just his physical appearance. He delivers a strong, though somewhat understated performance that should satisfy the male viewers while the females are busy feasting on his youth face and figure.For me the real star of the film is Colin Firth in the role of Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian's mentor and probably more to the point corruptor. Firth is the Mephistopheles personified; aloft, dispassionate, articulate and totally void of any human emotion or goodness. As Lord Wotton leads Dorian on the road to perdition one cannot help but become mesmerized by the transformation that eventually leads Dorian to that unenviable place where pupil becomes the teacher.As Faustian tale go, things do not end well for those who nail their soul to the Devil's altar.

1354076,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B003M986TI,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","With his tall slim body, long elegant hair, and pretty smooth face, Ben Barnes makes a great Dorian Gray. He has a youthful, almost feminine beauty that certainly would be needed to play the part of a human that is ageless and extremely handsome yet becoming rotten inside as his soul withers away. Oscar Wilde's novel is the basis of the film but there were some liberties taken in the film which in my opinion may have made the film stronger. Wilde hints at Dorian Gray's bi-sexuality in the novel but the film briefly allows this aspect of Dorian's character to be overt. One strength of the film was the excellent sets, especially the Victorian period interiors and the wonderful costumes of Regency England. There were scenes, just on the screen for a few seconds, which hinted at orgies and sado-masochism, which gave just the right amount of decadence to the film. Seeing Dorian Gray bound in leather straps for 2 seconds lets the viewer know that Dorian was exploring all kinds of sexual adventures in his ever lasting youth. Barnes does a good job of showing the cynical decay of Dorian's soul, the theme of Wilde's novel.Of course, it is totally expected that Colin Firth will do a great job, which he does as Lord Henry Wotton, he decadent aristocrat who urges Dorian to explore his vices. Ben Chaplin is also excellent as Basil Hallward, the artist who paints the portrait of Dorian and who is in love with his model.Dorian is an orphan who inherits a fortune. Henry Wotton is only all too ready to introduce Dorian to the sensual vices. Dorian's portrait is painted by Basil Hallward, who falls in love with Dorian. It is Henry who suggests that Dorian sell his soul to the devil in return for staying young and beautiful. Dorian falls in love with a young actress, Sibyl Vane, but eventually rejects her.  Basil comes too close to the flame of Dorian's destructive ways and loses his life. Dorian eventually departs London but returns years later after Henry's baby daughter has become a young woman. It is the desire of Emily Wotton and her father to know Dorian's secrets that leads to the climax of the film.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[4, 7]","DORIAN GRAY (2009, a most unfortunate cinematic year) is a disappointing and violent adaptation, though I can only commend the producers for trying an adaptation of a story that seems to be so feared it has only been done in film 15 times before (that I can count/recall). The first film adaptation was shot in 1912. A great version was done I think in 1945, and quite a few were done in the 1970s.This adaptation rather brings to life Oscar Wilde's original novel ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" in a faithful atmosphere. There is a difference in my mind between a faithful adaptation and adapting in a faithful atmosphere. This film has far too many revolting scenes, in spite of the stunning beauty of  Ben Barnes (famous as Caspian from ""The Chronicles of Narnia""), who may not be everyone's cup of tea anyway. It strikes me that a better adaptation could have been done.No doubt the violence and the debauchery is spot-on; this film reminded me that as youngsters, we were not allowed to read anything by Wilde. Wilde was taboo and my parents would have killed us if they'd caught us reading anything like DORIAN GRAY. This film shows me why: Wilde captured Gothic horror in a way that Poe couldn't quite reach. His ""Masque of the Red Death"" is as close I can imagine Poe getting to GRAY, though Wilde was influenced deeply by Poe.I'm also reminded that, like Kafka's ""Metamorphosis"", Wilde was writing what is essentially a homosexual parable. It has always been understood in that light, and is always mentioned when the subject is addressed. I agree with the assessment, and I commend this film for having at least the partial nerve to address the homosexuality inherent in Gray's character.Colin Firth, who occasionally makes role choices that would have mystified King Solomon, plays Lord Henry Wotton; the handsome Ben Chaplin plays the artist Basil Hallward, who paints The Picture. Fiona Shaw stars as Agatha; there are other great names who frankly do not deserve to be shoved in this rotten film. Oh, the original novel was scarcely much better to be sure - which is the reason I expected better imagination than this film offers.One highlight for me was the kiss between Barnes and Chaplin; the other highlight was Dorian's decision to end his life as his painting yelled helplessly from the centre of the room. Some highlights! I was reminded of Justin's first kiss on ""Ugly Betty"" - and that was a much sweeter gay victory.So do not believe the reviews that claim Barnes had ""gay sex scenes"". The film goes tremendously far out of its way to avoid any homosexuality in Gray, and Barnes has been complaining to anyone who will listen how uncomfortable he was having to kiss Ben Chaplin. Feh! All of it, nonsense as fetid as the movie.In 2004 Josh Duhamel had the title role, and the criticism of that version holds true here: no Wilde witticisms, no evil fire burning in Gray's eyes, no feeling of him driving himself toward his own annihilation. Just wooden acting and uncomfortable screen kisses.That pretty much sums up this film - and I wouldn't waste a penny or a minute on it.

The settings, costumes, and acting are all outstanding and with Parker's 'enhancing' some of the debauchery in the transformed life of this famous character updated to allow for more sensuality and brutality than prior cinematic versions, the tale really becomes dramatic.Dorian Gray (Ben Barnes), an orphaned, abused child who happens to inherit a mansion in London upon the death of his only relative, comes to London as a young inordinately handsome yet shy man.  He is immediately seizes the attention of Lord Henry Wotton (Colin Firth) who believes that the only goal in life is to respond to your desires, to your sensual needs.  Dorian is introduced to a young painter Basil Hallward (Ben Chaplin) who is attracted to Dorian's beauty and as he paints his portrait he becomes enamored with his model. As the portrait is completed Lord Henry suggests that Dorian could always remain as beautiful as his portrait if he 'sold his soul' to remain ever youthful. Dorian takes up the idea and follows Lord Henry's tutelage to drink, smoke, and carouse in brothels, opium dens, and in the boudoirs of all the middle aged ladies of society. He encounters a beautiful young actress Sibyl Vane (Rachel Hurd-Wood), falls in love only to cast her aside (we later discover that her body has been thrown into the river much to the chagrin of her brother James (Johnny Harris).  As Dorian's thirst for lusty and scandalous behaviors increases he causes much harm: the mutual attraction between Dorian and Basil eventually results in Dorian butchering Basil and discarding his body into the river grave.  Dorian decides to leave London and  travel to exotic places to try to fill his lascivious appetite: he returns twenty odd years later and every one has aged except Dorian.  Lord Henry's daughter Emily (Rebecca Hall), born when Dorian departed London, is Dorian's intellectual match and the two are mutually attracted but Lord Henry violently objects, knowing what the real Dorian Gray is inside.  Dorian's secret - that he remains young eternally while his portrait ages and reveals the vile aspects of his corrupt life - is finally revealed and the ending is a gruesome one.Ben Barnes, Colin Firth, Ben Chaplin, and Rebecca Hall are all superb in their roles - as are all of the many well-known fine British actors who fill minor roles.  The DVD adds comments from many of these actors in a way that focuses on Oscar Wilde's novel, making the commitment of everyone involved seem more acutely aware of the film's purpose.  It is a very well photographed, costumes, and lighted piece of cinematography - a truly excellent period piece for this great novel to come alive again.

It stays fairly true to the book as far as I can recall, though I don't remember the homoerotic elements being so blatant in the book (in spite of what Oscar Wilde's life may have been).  Wilde was an incredible writer and poet and this story of sin and the supernatural is still surprisingly powerful today.  I thought they did a decent job, though I haven't seen the 1945 version.  The book (a short novel) is great though - I'd highly recommend reading that before seeing this. Imagination is still more powerful than CG technology.. and Wilde's wit and wisdom are MUCH better absorbed in the written form. It's not long and it's easy to get into (the book).  But for what it's worth, and for those who aren't planning to read it, this film still conjures up the young ghost of a Dorian Gray, a theme that explores the ultimate worth of pleasures (and other crimes) in the face of a fading world.",4,Gray Matter,1286323200,"10 6, 2010",2010,909,"['Not', 'bad', 'fairly', 'true', 'book', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'recall', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'homoerotic', 'elements', 'being', 'so', 'blatant', 'book', 'spite', 'what', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'life', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Wilde', 'was', 'incredible', 'writer', 'poet', 'story', 'sin', 'supernatural', 'still', 'surprisingly', 'powerful', 'today', 'thought', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', '1945', 'version', 'book', 'short', 'novel', 'great', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'reading', 'seeing', 'Imagination', 'still', 'more', 'powerful', 'CG', 'technology..', 'Wilde', 'wit', 'wisdom', 'are', 'MUCH', 'better', 'absorbed', 'written', 'form', 'not', 'long', 'easy', 'get', 'book', 'what', 'worth', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'planning', 'read', 'film', 'still', 'up', 'young', 'ghost', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'theme', 'ultimate', 'worth', 'pleasures', 'other', 'crimes', 'face', 'fading', 'world']",N/A

Instead, the oil ages and is defiled by Gray's wicked lifestyle. The young man is heir to Lord Kelso but is influenced by the viciously immoral suggestions of Lord Wotton (Colin Firth). Firth, like Ben Barnes playing Dorian, are hugely successful playing such dark characters. This Oscar Wilde adaptation is not the typical Victorian character for these actors, but they are successful in making the viewer disgusted with their behavior. The artist, Basil (Ben Chaplin) is another character well played although having a less involved role in this dastardly story of Victorian greed, abuses, hypocrisy, deceit, lusts, and wanton waste of the upper class.A later arriving role of Emily is excellently played by Rebecca Hall. A significant portion of the worth of the movie, even though a much lessened amount of screen time involved.  The acting is as well done as the period setting and costuming. Be aware, if you don't know the story of Wilde's book, which this is about everything obscene that one man could experience. It's all there and shown including murder, sex, homosexuality, drugs, alcohol, smoking, language, nudity, violence, prostitution, well, now you get the picture. Dorian lusted and took it all in, that that is displayed, but in as light a form that could be used and yet get the significance of the lowness of the lifestyle of Gray across. Thus the rating R for devilishly RAW.Lord Henry Wotton quotes: ""Life is a moment. There is no hereafter. So make it burn always with the hardest flame."" ""No civilized man regrets a pleasure.""Gray's too late reply: ""My life has been a monstrous corruption.""This would be considered 5-stars by those who thrive on the dark plots in film. As a classic book adaptation it is 4-stars worthy. Much of the book is quickly covered, but it is impossible to adapt a novel any other way without making it a multi-episode epic.

1354093,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B003M986TI,Haunted Flower,"[1, 1]","1 Disc Blu-Ray, released August 24, 2010Oliver Parker has directed Oscar Wilde's plays, ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" and ""An Ideal Husband"" and now turns to his Victorian-era thriller novel, ""Dorian Gray."" It stars Ben Barnes as Dorian Gray, the absolute picture of youth and beauty whose appearance is captured exquisitely in a painting. When asked if he would give up his soul to stay the way he appears in the picture, he says he would and miraculously over time his portrait ages while he does not and Gray's pleasure-filled life spirals out of control.When Gray arrives on the scene in London for the first time, it is after the death of his grandfather. He is swept up into lavish parties and meets Lord Henry played by Colin Firth who encourages him to indulge in every pleasurable sensation and lead the life he wishes he could. Gray is at first an innocent, but the influence of Henry is undeniable as the two continue to go out on the town. Lord Henry's friend Basil Hallward is a society artist who paints the portrait and declares it possibly his best work and doesn't understand why Gray won't let him borrow it back for a gallery show he wants to put on.Ben Barnes is the perfect casting choice as he always seems to glow on screen amongst other characters and backgrounds. His skin appears flawless and with a minor change of expression he can express innocence and love or lust and evil. His change in character over the course of the film is haunting and it certainly helps that the story is so gripping. He rules this entire movie but it certainly helps that he has such an outstanding cast behind him.Case in point, Colin Firth graces the cast with his presence playing a role he excels in as the guy that kind of puts everyone else off. He sweeps Dorian into the high class society encouraging a lack of morality and an excess of naughty behavior. Colin Firth sports a mustache so that is how you know he's a bad influence, but he is not all bad since eventually he has a daughter played by Rebecca Hall that he is very protective of when she becomes drawn to Dorian's charms.Rebecca Hall is such an honest actress who puts forth so much authenticity in her characters, it's always a treat to see her. This role is more average as the quirky daughter attracted to Dorian against her father's will, but go check her out in ""Please Give"" for a really stand-out performance.The Blu-Ray version is gorgeous. This is a movie that benefits from the Blu-Ray treatment being such an elegant period piece and it just makes Ben Barnes' face look more flawless by comparison to everyone else. This classic story modernized is a fantastic soul-selling morality piece and looks great to boot so check it out! Fascinating how new Blu-rays coming out are less expensive than their DVD counterparts....see below.Bonus Features:There is a making-of feature discussing the Oscar Wilde book and its translation to the big screen and how it relates to society today from the perspective of the filmmakers and cast. There are featurettes on the extensive make up and wardrobe for the other cast members until Dorian Gray's fantastic ending, the painting itself and the man commissioned to create it for them, the use of the train station/Smithfield market, and the visual effects of the painting. The costume design photo gallery features Ruth Myers' original sketches come to life played to the soundtrack from the movie.The Deleted Scenes show Dorian Gray facing a woman on her death bed at peace, a little more background on his fiancee's brother in conversation, and an encounter with a mysterious man who seems to know something about the contract.

Sondel - lover of the arts""","[1, 1]","Don't ask me why this wonderfully atmospheric big screen adaptation of Oscar Wilde's macabre tale was never released in the USA, just be thankful the DVD has been.  Director Oliver Parker and screenwriter Toby Finlay have done an admirable (if not completely faithful) job of bringing Wilde's classic to the screen.For those unfamiliar with this story: a young gentleman has his portrait painted and, like Narcissus before him, he becomes transfixed by his own reflection.  In the case of Dorian Gray, he sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty and from that moment on his portrait alone reflects each and every physical sign of age, as well as the corruption of his soul.  Along with Dracula, The Picture of Dorian Gray remains the greatest Victorian gothic horror story.Among the many aspects that work so well in this adaptation is the casting of the comely Ben Barnes (Prince Caspian) as Gray; from innocent adolescent to debauched rake to world weary immoralist, the young actor communicates the multi-faceted character with great dexterity.  Colin Firth, always dependable, adds gravity as Gray's mentor cum nemesis.  Ben Chaplin gives a strong performance as the ill-fated portrait artist and voice of morality.  The two Bens share a sexy scene of seduction, only implied in Wilde's manuscript.Horror fan's of Saw and Midnight Meat Train my be disappointed; those who prefer classy horror fare like The Innocents, The Haunting or the old Hammer horror films with Christopher Lee, should enjoy this.

1354096,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B003M986TI,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","Such a master piece of English literature is very tempting if not mesmerizing for film makers. The problem is that it is so well known and so famous that it is very difficult to do something fresh, something new and authentic, something fascinating.  Apparently Oliver Parker succeeds in doing that.His first solution is to reduce the dialogue to a minimal presence and especially to reduce it to catch phrases, short proverbial sentences, small philosophical sayings that are really trying to catch flies by preaching full enjoyment of all pleasures but only for the flies it catches and not for the utterer of such lame falsely ethical mottos, like ""Conscience is a polite term for cowardice."" ""Some things are more precious because they don't last."" ""I want to begin again, stay away from everything, everything but you,"" he declares to Emily Wharton minutes before he rapes her, takes her, before she gives herself to him in a fully mesmerized state.When this is done you can then play with some sound special effects to create a disquieting and even disturbing atmosphere. The house creaks, cracks and moans constantly. The attic is haunted with a fugacious vision of the father beating up his young son who is finding refuge there or maybe is kept prisoner there, and a piece of dialogue suggests the mother died early and the father is reverting his sorrow onto his son he keeps responsible for the death. And I will say nothing of the moaning people in the bleak night of ;London, of the crying and howling in the various opium dens and other brothels and cut-throat dungeons.Visual effects come next, not so much the very special ones we find in all science fiction films, or horror films. Essentially lights and shadows, and fast camera movements and very dynamic editing. We then start doubting what we have just seen for but an instant or what we have hardly espied hardly a second. The visual work of the film is subliminal and works onto our unconscious to create an atmosphere of fear, fright, danger, horror, cruelty, and so many nice feelings.Then it is easy to work onto our psyche to make us horrified, terrified and grossed out by that monstrous man and at the same time to build up the end so well that we are on the side of the monster who is trapped in an attic from which he cannot escape because the world does not want to believe he has changed, and we actually should doubt his having changed really since he is somewhere between 40 and 50 and he pretends to be in love with a young girl around at the very most 18.

So, when I saw the DVD I immediately ordered it.  First off, I have to say I have never read the book, so I can't comment on how good an adaptation it is.  Like many though, I am familiar with the basic story:  young man nonchalantly offers his soul in exchange for eternal youth.  Thereafter, the painting of him takes on all his sins and ages for him.  Sounds like a great story!  Only after watching the film, I'm disappointed.There were a lot of good things about the movie.  Colin Firth and Ben Barnes were excellent in the roles of Lord Henry Wotton and the title character.  And the supporting actors were also very good.  The setting, costumes and ambiance were fantastic.  And, I was excited to see that it was an R rated film.  A book that was so controversial, with a character so depraved, needn't be for the PG-13 set.  And, the scenes that earned the R met my expectations.  There's nudity, violence and debauchery.  And the ending was tense and exciting.  Unfortunately, the rest of the film was slow and downright boring at times!  This was surprising since the filmmaker, in the making-of featurette, admits to taking liberties with the story in the book to fit it for film. Why take liberties if you aren't going for more even pace to keep the audience engaged?Overall, I did enjoy the film as Barnes was so exceptional as Dorian.  And, I'll probably watch it again - with my finger on the fast-forward button. As to the DVD,  it is pretty good for a single disc edition.

Throughout, I wondered how Wilde would react to the film, were he still with us. On one hand, I believe he would have appreciated the touch of horror; I certainly felt it in his writing. He was quoted from another of his books (Lady Windermere's Fan) ""In this world there are only two tragedies. One is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it."" In this movie, the latter was certainly true for poor Dorian.On the other hand, the book 'Picture of Dorian Gray' seemed fairly minimalist in affect (as was Barnes' interpretation of the character) so, would Mr. Wilde be a smidge put off by all the melodrama and overt sexual content? Who knows? He used a lot of symbolism and subtle innuendo in his writing, but the politics of the time could account for some of what he didn't literally spell out, I suppose. After all, he was imprisoned for his lifestyle and beliefs, for a time.Wilde lived a deep and complicated life. His personality and character were revealed through his writing and oh, what I would have given to be on his list of friends. ""A good friend will stab you in the front."" -- Oscar WildeAlas, the book, in this case, pleased my pitiful imagination more than the movie. While the acting was superb, I had a difficult time reconciling myself with what I felt was an over-reach on the tenor of this great story. You know, the old 'less is more' adage. So, from me, 3 1/2 stars, rounded up.My disclaimer to the literary elite: I am simply an appreciator of art, not a professional, so take my opinion with a grain of whatever you prefer.""I don't say we all ought to misbehave, but we all ought to look as if we could."" -- Oscar Wilde",4,"""No object is so beautiful that, under certain conditions, it will not look ugly."" - Oscar Wilde",1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,1792,"[""'Dorian"", 'Gray', 'directed', 'Oliver', 'Parker', 'definitely', 'more', 'graphic', 'adaptation', 'spirit', 'book', 'written', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'Throughout', 'wondered', 'how', 'Wilde', 'would', 'react', 'film', 'were', 'still', 'one', 'hand', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'appreciated', 'touch', 'horror', 'certainly', 'felt', 'writing', 'was', 'quoted', 'books', 'Lady', 'Windermere', 'Fan', 'world', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'tragedies', 'One', 'not', 'getting', 'what', 'one', 'other', 'getting', 'movie', 'latter', 'was', 'certainly', 'true', 'poor', 'Dorian.On', 'other', 'hand', 'book', ""'Picture"", 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'seemed', 'fairly', 'minimalist', 'affect', 'was', 'Barnes', 'interpretation', 'character', 'so', 'would', 'Mr.', 'Wilde', 'be', 'smidge', 'put', 'off', 'melodrama', 'overt', 'sexual', 'content', 'Who', 'used', 'lot', 'symbolism', 'subtle', 'innuendo', 'writing', 'politics', 'time', 'could', 'account', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'literally', 'spell', 'out', 'suppose', 'was', 'imprisoned', 'lifestyle', 'beliefs', 'time.Wilde', 'lived', 'deep', 'complicated', 'life', 'personality', 'character', 'were', 'revealed', 'writing', 'oh', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'be', 'list', 'friends', 'good', 'friend', 'will', 'stab', 'front', 'Oscar', 'WildeAlas', 'book', 'case', 'pleased', 'pitiful', 'imagination', 'more', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'had', 'difficult', 'time', 'reconciling', 'what', 'felt', 'was', 'over-reach', 'tenor', 'great', 'story', 'know', 'old', ""'less"", 'more', ""'"", 'adage', 'So', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'rounded', 'up.My', 'disclaimer', 'literary', 'elite', 'am', 'simply', 'appreciator', 'art', 'not', 'professional', 'so', 'take', 'opinion', 'grain', 'prefer', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'ought', 'misbehave', 'ought', 'look', 'could', 'Oscar', 'Wilde']",N/A

But you have to understand, there is no way a well written novel can be condensed into a movie that will be a watchable length.  I personally loved the Dorian Gray novel, but have to admit the book was long winded.  There was many parts that drug on and on and really caused me to lose track of what was going on because I was kind of skimming to get to something interesting.This movie I felt really stripped out all of the garbage and made a movie the was interesting and accurate to the original storyline.  Dorian Gray for those who don't know, is basically a story about the life of a pretty boy turned into a corrupt sex addicted (toward both men and women), opium addict, drunk, murdering, monster whose youth is forever contained through a magical transfer of his soul into a self-portrait.  There is no huge action sequence, no evil enemy to stop from taking over the world, or any majorly deep plot.  Its just about what a person with eternal youth could pull off.Barnes played a hell of a part, and I thought was a perfect choice for Dorian.  The movie had the peverted, dark, twisted atmosphere that it needed and all the characters were excellent.  I liked the acting because everyone seemed to fit into place perfectly.Great movie for a weekend watch, but don't expect a nail-bitter.

Because the reviews on amazon.com were so positive, the prospect of seeing Colin Firth portray Lord Henry Wotton so enticing, and the price for the bluray version so affordable, I ordered it.  I invited a friend (another film buff and a big Firth fan) over to watch it with me.  After about fifteen minutes or so into it, I turned to her and said, 'This is boring!""  She agreed and summed it up perfectly...""It's so flat!""  Oscar Wilde couldn't have said it better.  Although the 1945 version with Hurd Hatfield and George Sanders was rather hammy and campy in parts, it was a much better film than this production.  It left an indelible impression for me the first time I saw it.  It visually captured the atmosphere of Wilde's novel wonderfully. The elegant cinematography, the loving attention to detail, and the fine actors made it a film I would think about and want to see again for years to come.Angela Lansbury's Sybil Vane was touchingly moving and beautiful.  Sybil Vane in this version was unmemorable and almost superfluous.  And this character should never be considered superfluous.  Colin Firth's portrayal of Lord Wotton was woefully lacking in charisma and power.  George Sanders set a standard that few have come even close to achieving with his interpretation of Lord Wotton.  Where was this chemistry that other viewers of this film were claiming ignited between Firth and Ben Barnes?!!!  I saw none of that.  And, Ben Barnes...well...  I have yet to see a great portrayal of Dorian Gray.  Barnes was not up to the task.  Stiff and unconvincing, he was, sadly, not beautiful enough to make me believe that he could make all of society fall under his spell.  I would like to see all the other other versions of Dorian Gray that are currently available on DVD.  Perhaps in one of them is a definitive Dorian Gray.  As much as I liked the 1945 version, Hurd Hatfield was not the ideal actor for me.By choosing to invest more time depicting the debauchery and sexuality of Dorian's corruption, the film became tedious and, ultimately, left an unpleasant impression.  We turned the movie off (about twenty minutes into it) and went on to more satisfying fare.  But I decided to give the film another chance.  I put it on again when my friend had left in hopes that it would get better.

What I can say however is that it is a  great film. Dorian, if you haven't read the book either, is a hedonist who indulges all his whims (refer to Ecclessiastes) and having made a pact with the devil, does not suffer any of the consequences of his unbridled lifestlye on his person. Someone must pay however, and in this case it  is his portrait that suffers in his place.Ben Barnes plays Dorian quite well I think, and Colin Firth is quite convincing as the worldly-wise mentor, Lord Henry Wotton.

1354120,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B003M986TI,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[8, 12]","This is the first time when a movie with such an engaging and talented cast fell short. Dorian Gray is my favorite story. I've seen all of the film and play adaptations and this was sad compared to its predecessors.I realize this was made for Showtime but it seemed rushed and rather cheap for even a made-for-cable film. The movie felt like it was a play, not a movie. This adaptation was useless. There was no point for it to be made other than to give people jobs. I was shocked that Colin Firth was in this mess.I enjoyed the actors. Ben Barnes (never heard of him before this) fit Dorian perfectly. Ben Chaplin was convincing as Basil and Firth stole the show. But the movie was just bad. It was an embarrassment to such a fascinating tale.What I love about Dorian Gray is the creepiness of the story and this lacked creepiness. Dorian kills and goes off to sex clubs but you never really feel convinced he's into this stuff. Ben just didn't carry the film well for me. I think he looked the part of Dorian but I think a better actor would've done a better job. He was also too boyish and innocent-looking. Other actors who played Dorian always had a suspenseful look to them even if they were handsome but Ben is just too ""frat boy look"" for me to take seriously in this role.The movie was incredibly slow and boring considering how short it was. I fell asleep on it through the entire movie. Luckily I got it on DVD so I could rewind back but still. I kept dozing off. Some things moved too slow while others moved too fast and it seemed thrown together with a lack of editing. You had tons of female characters who weren't properly introduced so you started to get them confused. The scenes also switched badly. People would be all over the place and you didn't know how the heck they got there from time to time.When Dorian went on vacation all those years, none of it was shown in the film. He left one day and came back the next with everyone older. Made no sense. It was like the film skipped out on things because they had a time restraint. Also I think they skipped on some killings Dorian did but not sure. I think he kills someone in the street in the original story but you didn't get that here.What I hated the most was Dorian going to the sex parlor. It was completely lame and didn't add anything to this particular Dorian film. We are supposed to see how dark his soul is becoming by him going to these clubs but it just wasn't convincing.The biggest disappointment was the painting. I remember other Dorian Gray films and I would be so frightened for days just at the way the portrait look so I couldn't wait to see how it would look in this film. Complete disappointment. Instead of putting the time and effort into making the picture look authentic all we get is a big special effects show with cheap-looking results. To top it off the portrait made sounds and moved its mouth! Please! This is the case of too much not being enough. The filmmakers turned a classic into a joke. Everything doesn't need special effects!This is the worst Dorian Gray movie ever made and I hope they don't make another one if they are all gonna be this bad. I see why this was on cable and didn't make it to the big screen.If you love this timeless story as much as I do, skip this sad copycat and check this out:The Picture of Dorian Gray with George SandersIt's a true classic and much better than this version.And I thought that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde with Dougray Scott was the worst film adaptation of a classic.

I always found the mystery of the Hurd Hatfield version really intriguing.  I would think, and try to imagine, just what debauchery Dorian was about.  But this version spells it all out in big letters and it just ruins all the delicious innuendo and need for imagination.  And yeah, Dorian's exploits turned out to be just about what one might suspect but I just didn't really need them depicted so concretely.  I would have been interested in and out and out porn flick that used this plot as a point of departure (I mean a really good porn flick, not the dreck and bad acting you always find with porn or erotica.)  And if not that, then I prefer a film, ala Mr. Lewin's, which leaves just enough to one's imagination.I really liked Hatfield's sort of flat, wooden performance as well.  His Dorian seemed a beautiful mannequin (sp?, waxen almost, and nearly devoid of feeling and emotion...which made one curious about his unseen exploits.

This UK film was more about Dorian than his infamous portrait.If you read the story you got the basic idea: Dorian (Ben Barnes) arrives in London, a naive, rich boy who inherits a large house complete with servants.  But there are two men who talk to Dorian who greatly influence him: one, artist Basil, who paints the portrait and Harry (played by Colin Firth) who corrupts him.A mild oath that the painting should remain as youthful as Dorian becomes mystical when he states he would ""nail my soul to the devil's door.""The film proceeds to show us the destruction of Dorian -- a new love quickly fades when he begins to cheat on her (Cybil Vane, played by Rebecca Hall) -- and her fate is tied to her brother, which brother proceeds to stalk Dorian for several decades!  This part of the film felt rushed with the girl's suicide and the brother hunting Dorian -- not very enthusiastically.No, the film was concentrating on Dorian rather than the enemies he was making.  Finally he find an intellectual equal with his friend Henry's daughter and comes to realize where the ""stench"" of his soul is coming from.The painting itself was a bit much -- the special effects with the creepy thing coming partially out of the paiting was a bit silly.  Why not just have the painting subtly change instead?Despite these quibbles, the acting was top notch -- you came to believe Dorian and little sympathy for him as he went off the deep end, screwing society women and making out with a few men as well -- and a horrific murder or two!Colin Firth (Oscar winner of last year's ""The King's Speech"") was the philosophical debaucher, with tidbits like: ""Life is a moment, makit it burn always with the hardest flame.""  But his encouragement for Dorian to be immoral and cast away his ethics resulted in a pretty bad end.Lesson learned:  Yeah, make your life a moment but combine your freedom of action with some moral bindings and give some purpose to your life.  Dorian's ""flame"", having no purpose, burned out rather quickly.Recommended.Cast & Crew:Director:Oliver ParkerWriters:Oscar Wilde (novel), Toby Finlay (screenplay)Stars:Ben Barnes, Colin Firth and Rebecca HallClassics:The Picture of Dorian Gray: An Annotated, Uncensored EditionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Oscar Wilde Collection (The Importance of Being Earnest / The Picture of Dorian Gray / An Ideal Husband / Lady Windermere's Fan)",4,"""I Am the Flame!""

I just haven't seen any of them and none that I have heard of were in the horror genre. Off the bad this may be worrisome that someone known more for movies involving romance is doing a horror film but the amount of sleaze brought forth in the lust filled world of this film practically requires it. I can't say that he has no experience in the horror genre as he was an actor in Hellraiser, Hellraiser 2, and Nightbreed. Clearly there is a little love for the darkness of films we all love. Dorian Gray is of course based off of the original novel by Oscar Wilde about a man who would not age though the painting that was done of him did. This screenplay was written for the big screen by Toby Finlay who has done nothing before or since and I kind of hope that changes since a lot of potential was shown in this film.While the film itself can't be said to be fully faithful to the original novel to make it the horror film that it is would be impossible to have kept it 100% in line with the original. That works perfectly though as the constant barrage of sex and violence that is shown fits exactly for how the movie itself plays out. The story focuses around Dorian (Ben Barnes) who is a young man recently come to wealth that has just arrived in the city. Here he knows not a soul or how the social structure works or how dark many of the people he is soon to meet are within their circle. He is quick to meet Basil (Ben Chaplin) a famous artist who is enamored with his looks and eventually is the one to catch his likeness on canvas. At one of the first social events he is brought to he is introduced to Lord Henry (Colin Firth) who is the embodiment of hedonism. Lord Henry quickly realizes that the young Dorian is extremely impressionable and willing to listen to nearly anything he says so tries to teach him the ways of Earthly pleasures that he lives by.As Dorian slowly starts to succumb to the temptations of an overly sexual lifestyle it is agreed that he will allow Basil to paint him. At the paintings completion, having fallen into the lifestyle of hedonism, Dorian mentions he would sell basically attach his soul to such perfection for eternal pleasure. This is of course is exactly what happens as his soul becomes attached to the painting so that anything that is negative which he does or would happen to him in fact happens to the painting while he is left untouched.Dorian ends up needing to kill to keep his secret and instead of feeling remorse decides to travel the world as he does not wish to be thought of as involved in that. He spends over 30 years away and when he returns his still living friends are shocked to see that he has not aged. A lifestyle of sin has completely corrupted the painting that stores his soul and when he finally finds something to live for it is predictable what befalls the painting itself. Overall it is a good tale and while the ending didn't feel right with how Dorian acted right up to it was still a fun watch.",3,"Great concept that was mainly executed pretty well, worth a watch!",1301788800,"04 3, 2011",2011,3119,"['Director', 'Oliver', 'Parker', 'not', 'new', 'making', 'films', 'most', 'what', 'made', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'had', 'few', 'films', 'have', 'just', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'none', 'have', 'heard', 'were', 'horror', 'genre', 'bad', 'may', 'be', 'worrisome', 'someone', 'known', 'more', 'movies', 'involving', 'romance', 'doing', 'horror', 'film', 'amount', 'sleaze', 'brought', 'forth', 'lust', 'filled', 'world', 'film', 'practically', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'experience', 'horror', 'genre', 'was', 'actor', 'Hellraiser', 'Hellraiser', '2', 'Nightbreed', 'Clearly', 'little', 'love', 'darkness', 'films', 'love', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'course', 'based', 'original', 'novel', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'age', 'painting', 'was', 'done', 'did', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'big', 'screen', 'Toby', 'Finlay', 'who', 'done', 'nothing', 'kind', 'hope', 'changes', 'lot', 'potential', 'was', 'shown', 'film.While', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'be', 'fully', 'faithful', 'original', 'novel', 'make', 'horror', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'have', 'kept', '100', '%', 'line', 'original', 'perfectly', 'constant', 'barrage', 'sex', 'violence', 'shown', 'fits', 'exactly', 'how', 'movie', 'out', 'story', 'Dorian', 'Ben', 'Barnes', 'who', 'young', 'man', 'recently', 'come', 'wealth', 'just', 'arrived', 'city', 'Here', 'not', 'soul', 'how', 'social', 'structure', 'how', 'dark', 'many', 'people', 'soon', 'meet', 'are', 'circle', 'quick', 'meet', 'Basil', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'famous', 'artist', 'who', 'enamored', 'looks', 'eventually', 'one', 'catch', 'likeness', 'canvas', 'one', 'first', 'social', 'events', 'brought', 'introduced', 'Lord', 'Henry', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'who', 'embodiment', 'hedonism', 'Lord', 'Henry', 'quickly', 'young', 'Dorian', 'extremely', 'impressionable', 'willing', 'listen', 'nearly', 'anything', 'so', 'teach', 'ways', 'Earthly', 'pleasures', 'by.As', 'Dorian', 'slowly', 'succumb', 'temptations', 'overly', 'sexual', 'lifestyle', 'agreed', 'will', 'allow', 'Basil', 'paint', 'paintings', 'completion', 'having', 'fallen', 'lifestyle', 'hedonism', 'Dorian', 'mentions', 'would', 'sell', 'basically', 'attach', 'soul', 'such', 'perfection', 'eternal', 'pleasure', 'course', 'exactly', 'what', 'soul', 'attached', 'painting', 'so', 'anything', 'negative', 'would', 'happen', 'fact', 'happens', 'painting', 'left', 'untouched.Dorian', 'up', 'needing', 'kill', 'keep', 'secret', 'instead', 'feeling', 'remorse', 'decides', 'travel', 'world', 'not', 'wish', 'be', 'thought', 'as', 'involved', '30', 'years', 'away', 'when', 'still', 'living', 'friends', 'are', 'shocked', 'see', 'not', 'aged', 'lifestyle', 'sin', 'completely', 'corrupted', 'painting', 'stores', 'soul', 'when', 'finally', 'something', 'live', 'predictable', 'painting', 'Overall', 'good', 'tale', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'how', 'Dorian', 'acted', 'right', 'up', 'was', 'still', 'fun', 'watch']",N/A

1354134,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B003M986TI,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[1, 1]","""Dorian Gray""  is based on  Oscar Wilde's 1890 novel.  When strikingly handsome Dorian (Ben Barnes) arrives in Victorian London, he is swept into a social whirlwind by the charismatic Lord Henry Wotton (Colin Firth), who introduces him to the hedonistic pleasures of the city.  Lord Henry's friend, society artist Basil Hallward (Ben Chaplin), paints a portrait of Dorian to capture the full breadth of his youthful beauty and when it's unveiled, Dorian makes a wishful vow to give anything to stay as he is in the picture, even his soul.  His casual pledge is fulfilled when his portrait ages while he does not, and he descends down a path of horror, wickedness, debauchery, and murder in order to hide his frightening secret.Director Oliver Parker doesn't avoid the violent and sexual aspects of Dorian's exploits.  This Dorian is attractive to men as well as women, and he is ready, willing, and able to enjoy the pleasures of both sexes.  He's also into drugs, sadomasochism, and body piercing.There are elements here of ""Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde,"" since the setting of both works is the same period and both Hyde and Dorian seek pleasure above all else.  Hyde is more the monster, but Dorian's unhealthy pursuits render him less and less human.The film's strong points are Firth's outstanding performance as Lord Henry and the portrayal of turn-of-the-last-century London.

So, the fleeting turns eternal and Dorian, beautiful Dorian, becomes the adventurer that he always wanted to be.I recall seeing this movie a little while back, but it took some time for th emovie to land in the laps of the U.S. consumer. Out of all the Dorian Gray movies, and there are quite a few of them, this one is quite possibly one of the best around. Sure, it doesn't have all of the things that the original had. It also isn't exactly like the original in other ways, too, because a lot of the things Dorian does are not exactly hand-in-hand experiences when you walk with polite society. So, the movies we see now are always going to be different.The one thing that most movies lack are a good Dorian and a good secondary character as well.

The answer is ""Dorian Gray,"" Oliver Parker's lamentable 2009 adaptation that would either shock or amuse the great writer, though not in the way the filmmakers intended.The story of Dorian Gray is so famous that it does not need to be repeated in detail here. Ben Barnes plays a young and handsome late 19th century Englishman Dorian Gray, who having made a Faustian deal does not get old. Being enthralled by cynical Lord Henry Wotton (Colin Firth), Dorian commits sins and crimes, but every time he does, his image on the canvas changes, reflecting the corruption of his soul.Some people might say we should enjoy the film adaptation for what it is. In principle the argument makes a valid point, but not here, because ""Dorian Gray"" as a drama is plain boring and predictable. The story is rushed, especially the part where Dorian falls in love with an actress Sibyl Vane (Rachel Hurd-Wood). Dorian's ""hedonist lifestyle"" means cheesy love making scenes. The picture of Dorian Gray, the key element of the whole story, looks even cheesier, more like a zombie from a low-budget horror movie.Despite the decent production and costume designs, ""Dorian Gray"" greatly suffers from bland acting and uninspired direction. Director Oliver Parker has already made two films based on Oscar Wilde's works, ""An Ideal Husband"" (1999) and ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" (2002), but as you know, they were originally written as a play.

1354142,A17B9IJ50LIEVZ,B003M986TI,"William A. Smith ""Polymath""","[3, 4]","Mr. Parker seems to be forging a career in remakes of English classics--so far, two entries in the St. Trinian's saga, one Shakespeare (Othello), and no fewer than three goes at Oscar Wilde--An Ideal Husband, The Importance of Being Earnest, and the current entry. In tackling Wilde, Parker is up against formidable competition--a 1947 Alexander Korda version of An Ideal Husband, the almost definitive 1952 Asquith version of The Importance of Being Earnest, and several versions of The Picture of Dorian Gray, most notably the 1945 Lewin version with Hurd Hatfield in the title role, George Sanders as Lord Henry, and a young Angela Lansbury as Sybil Vane.The Picture Of Dorian Gray, along with Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde, is one of the definitive literary explorations of the divided self--the notion that good and evil are within each of us, in some sense perpetually at war. I would say that Wilde's version--the story of an increasingly corrupt and decadent young man who maintains the look of innocent youth while his portrait ages and decays--is even more psychologically potent and symbolically charged than Stevenson's story. Like Jekyll and Hyde, it has attracted multiple adaptations, in modern film starting with the Lewin version of 1945 (there are a number of early silent versions I have not seen).Mr. Parker's version of Earnest was somewhat coarsened from the original, but still very well cast and exceedingly entertaining. In being coarsened, it became something of an Earnest for our time. The same applies, with far greater force, to this version of Dorian Gray. On the positive side--the physical production is very handsome. The effects with the portrait are often quite clever, and chilling, such as a maggot falling out of an eye instead of a teardrop. The casting--Barnes and Firth and Ben Chaplin as Basil Hallward the painter--is good. Barnes, in particular, looks right--more so that either Hurd Hatfield or Peter Firth in the 1976 BBC version, among many.In Wilde's story, the cause of the mysterious link between Dorian and his portrait is never explained. The first failing in Parker's version is to explain the link in a most conventional way--the Faustian bargain. This simple choice has the effect of dumbing down the logic of the narrative, and weakening the psychological power. In addition, the film posits an abusive childhood for Dorian--a completely unnecessary bit of psychologizing. Much of the power of both Wilde's original and the 1945 version lies far more in suggestion than statement. There is plenty of statement in Parker's version--opium dens, exotic brothels, S and M--but, except for one rather explicit scene between Dorian and Basil, little of the homoerotic tension of the original novel survives in this rendering. Basil Hallward's murder is far bloodier here than in Lewin. But there is nothing as remotely chilling as the scene in Lewin in which Dorian forces ex-lover Alan Campbell (the relationship concealed, but perfectly obvious) to help his dispose of Basil's body. Here, it's just dumped into the Thames in pieces. Colin Firth does a good job as Lord Henry, but not quite up to Sanders' standard.This is, unfortunately, an unnecessary remake. Glossy, but unnecessary. Unfortunate, in that one could have do something rather special with the same cast and a more faithful script.3 out of 5--actually, 2.5.
