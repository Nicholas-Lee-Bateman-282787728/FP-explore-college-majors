1125819,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0010SAGHI,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","Ang Lee must have felt that he had a lot of atoning to do after releasing `The Hulk'.  Since that debacle he has delivered to us just two films, but both of them are so intricate and elaborate that you can feel his soul in each frame.  While I truly believe `Brokeback Mountain' may very well be the grandest film Lee will ever direct I must admit that `Se, Jie' comes very close.  It lacks some of the grace that enveloped its predecessor but it makes up for that in pure passion, and yes, lust.  There is an eerie calm that settles in over this film, creating a mood that permeates each and every frame.  From the opening sequence to the startling climax the viewer is entrenched in this story.  Some have balked about the running time but I actually love the influx of films that have taken their time this year; films that have exceeded that two-hour mark with ease.  `Se, Jie', like `Zodiac', `...Jesse James...', `Atonement' and `American Gangster' (to mention just a few), uses its running time to establish itself in the viewers soul, burrowing deep and never letting go.`Se, Jie' follows the story of a young student named Wong Chia Chi who joins a drama group that winds up being so much more than she expected.  The objective of this group is to stir up patriotism, but the group's leader Kuang Yu Min has more in mind for his friends.  With World War II underway Kuang convinces this group of immature and nave actors to join him in a mission to kill Mr. Yee, a Japanese collaborator who is responsible for the slaying of Chinese resistance fighters.  Under the guise of Mak Tai Tai, Wong infiltrates Yee's life and begins her dangerous mission to end it.The films primary focus becomes the chemistry and relationship between Wong and Yee.  We watch them flirt silently, their eyes meeting and dancing in this sort of lustful tango.  Wong works her hardest to seduce Yee, but it's effortless at a glance.  She befriends Yee's wife, making her presence always known and felt, creating an almost unavoidable attraction to all that she could offer.  It is apparent from their first meeting that Yee is intrigued, but he's a very cautious man and thus treads lightly.`Se, Jie' reminds me much of `Zwartboek', another espionage film noir released this year, this time of the German descent.  Both films manage to root themselves in the audience, and both films sport magnificent lead performances (both Tang Wei and Carice van Houten are outstanding) but `Se, Jie' manages to one up `Zwartboek' in that it fleshes out its story to a more fuller degree.  My initial complaint with `Zwartboek' is that it felt rushed despite its lengthy running time.  There was just so much to cover and its beginning and end felt incomplete.  `Se, Jie' doesn't have that problem.  It covers everything perfectly, never leaving the audience bewildered or wanting but leaving us completely satisfied.Much has been said of Tang Wei's marvelous performance but sadly that didn't translate into awards buzz.  Her portrayal of the young actress turned spy is breathtaking, especially when you consider that this is her first big screen role.  What a commanding and inspired debut performance.  She brilliantly plays off her co-stars, especially Tony Leung, who while given limited screen time manages to establish a well constructed and commanding character.`Se, Jie' has received a lot of attention due to its explicit love scenes.  This is a good and a bad thing.  The negative side to the attention is that it tends to draw away from the meaning behind these scenes and paints this film as nothing more than lusty filth when in actuality the love scenes are probably the most moving and graceful scenes within the film.  I am a firm believer in the idea that a tastefully done love scene can speak volumes for a heart or core of a film.  The scenes within this film offer up some of the best `acting' I've seen in a long time.  Scenes of this magnitude require the actors to strip not merely their clothes but also their guards and expose true unbridled emotion.  Both Wei and Leung deliver this masterfully.  It's within these scenes that we discover who these people, who these characters really are.We see their souls.`Se, Jie' may not be a film for everyone.  If you are not fascinated by the traditional film noirs of the past, the crime and or espionage thrillers, then this may fail to excite you.  Yes, some may also be turned off by the blunt love scenes mentioned above, but if you take these scenes in context and truly dissect them for what they are you discover that without them `Se, Jie' would be incomplete.Ang Lee does it once again, delivering a masterfully constructed film about relationships of the forbidden and `dangerous' kind that touches the soul of the viewer and challenges his thinking on a subject.  `Se, Jie' does not have the emotional strength of `Brokeback Mountain' but it does capture the same fluid translation from page to screen that made `Brokeback Mountain' so iconic.  I think Lee has proven his `Hulk' days are over.  `Se, Jie' can join `Brokeback Mountain', `Wo Hu Cang Long', The Ice Storm' and `Sense and Sensibility' as some of the greatest contributions to modern cinema.",5,Leave caution at the door and feel free to lust over this haunting masterpiece...,1204502400,"03 3, 2008",2008,5206,"['Ang', 'Lee', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'had', 'lot', 'atoning', 'do',

Wong, et al leech off one of their friend's rich parents and head off to infiltrate Mr. Yee's camp (he's the bad guy). Mr. Yee is married and pretty callous annnnnnd he has security out the ying yang so no one has been able to get rid of him. Wong plays Mahjong with Mr. Yee's wife's crew and just happens to catch Mr. Yee's eye. And thus starts some of the NC-17 parts. I'm talking about violent sex and unshaved armpits. Mr. Yee is not a particularly gentle soul. There is also some sexual tension between Wong and her Resistance buddy but Wong is in this horrible position with Mr. Yee and it all gets complicated. The NC-17 parts, I would have to say, do push the storyline of the movie forward, so I feel they were tasteful and called for. I would have given it five stars but I did feel the main characters were sort of flat.

1125824,ATYTXN352VQ8F,B0010SAGHI,chainlink,"[0, 4]","Reviews have mentioned Lee's Brokeback Mountain as context for his Lust, Caution, but my own feeling is that the earlier Sense and Sensibility is more relevant.It has often struck me as I've read Jane Austen that the course of her heroines' romances, while never untroubled (for otherwise there would be no novels), is nevertheless marked by a telling oversimplification. The moral assessment of the characters of prospective mates is made to dominate all other responses: love grows from approbation. What appeals is, ultimately, the good. This conceit itself appeals for its neatness and right-mindedness. But it seems impossible to me, unfortunately, to squeeze sex appeal out of admiration.So, I suspect, Lee provides this film as a kind of wry response to Jane Austen, a lesson on the stubborn, even ornery autonomy of sex: it seems simply a fact that one desires that of which one disapproves, maybe the more for the very disapproval, or sometimes, perhaps, even the disgust. Something like this insight is to be found already in Ovid and St. Paul, and is even more, um, explicitly made in Sacher-Masoch and de Sade, of course--so it requires a background of Jane Austen to pack much of a punch nowadays, most likely.  Still, the film sets up the problem quite convincingly, and while it has a Merchant-Ivory-sort of artificiality (not unlike the Austen film) about it, I found it an effective reminder of a depressing truth.",4,More lust than caution.,1231891200,"01 14, 2009",2009,1431,"['Reviews', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Lee', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'context', 'Lust', 'Caution', 'own', 'feeling', 'earlier', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'more', 'relevant.It', 'often', 'struck', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'course', 'heroines', 'romances', 'never', 'untroubled', 'otherwise', 'would', 'be', 'novels', 'nevertheless', 'marked', 'telling', 'oversimplification', 'moral', 'assessment', 'characters', 'prospective', 'mates', 'made', 'dominate', 'other', 'responses', 'love', 'grows', 'approbation', 'What', 'appeals', 'ultimately', 'good', 'conceit', 'appeals', 'neatness', 'right-mindedness', 'impossible', 'unfortunately', 'squeeze', 'sex', 'appeal', 'admiration.So', 'suspect', 'Lee', 'film', 'kind', 'wry', 'response', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'lesson', 'stubborn', 'even', 'ornery', 'autonomy', 'sex', 'simply', 'fact', 'one', 'one', 'maybe', 'more', 'very', 'disapproval', 'sometimes', 'perhaps', 'even', 'disgust', 'Something', 'insight', 'be', 'found', 'already', 'Ovid', 'St.', 'Paul', 'even', 'more', 'um', 'explicitly', 'made', 'Sacher-Masoch', 'de', 'Sade', 'course', 'background', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'pack', 'much', 'punch', 'nowadays', 'most', 'likely', 'Still', 'film', 'up', 'problem', 'quite', 'convincingly', 'Merchant-Ivory-sort', 'artificiality', 'not', 'Austen', 'film', 'found', 'effective', 'reminder', 'depressing', 'truth']",N/A

On the other, I think Ang Lee made a poor decision to push the sex to the point of a NC-17 and diminish his target audience to a very small group of people.I wasn't planning on the seeing the film myself, but some of the reviews really interested me and when I had the opportunity to see it I went ahead and I'm glad I did.  The story is great, I believe in all of the characters and what they are each trying to do.  I like the deception throughout with the justification of trying to kill a very bad man and getting lost in a conspiracy of lust and resolve.  The cinematography is superb and the acting is nearly perfect, the pacing is slower then some but it very much kept my interest.  Regardless of it's actual authenticity, of which I know nothing about, it is a very effective period piece and as a Chinese film with it's own perspective on values, filmmaking and perspective.However, I was disappointed that Ang Lee didn't tone down the sex to an 'R' rating (or even lower), I didn't feel like the story actually needed it, I think it could have been every bit as effective if it had been mostly implied and I wouldn't have enjoyed it more.  I think Lee also alienated a lot of his potential audience, I know it's supposed to be high brow and intellectual but I don't agree with that decision.  I'm not even sure who I could recommend the film to, almost no one I know would actually watch a film with this rating.

1125827,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0010SAGHI,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 3]","There have been a couple instances lately where a film's hype becomes more well known than the film itself. Whether success or controversy, people seem to talk and debate more about one aspect of the film than what the film's story is or what it's trying to do. ""Brokeback Mountain"", Ang Lee's Oscar-winning (but personally, vastly overrated) film garnered controversy simply for showing a homosexual relationship when it really had nothing to do with anything. On the other hand, while ""Lust, Caution"" is a love story between a man and a woman, it's arguably more controversial but was released without much fanfare or media attention. Too bad cause the film is actually quite good and is probably Lee's best film since ""Crouching Tiger"".Wang Chia Chi is a college student who gets invited to work in a theatre company, who does more patriotic plays as opposed to classics. The head of the group, Kuang, is considerably patriotic to the point of enlisting the actors to start a resistance and assassinate a target, Mr. Yee who is actually a traitor and helping out the enemy. The group decides to let Wang get herself into Mr. Yee's life to allow a better shot at him. But Wang and Yee both start getting attracted to each other but with danger of being caught or killed always around, the two find themselves caught between the feelings they have and the mission.Lust, Caution is different from its controversy than Brokeback Mountain was since the sex in this film is quite graphic whereas the nature of the latter was the big issue. However, that also became an easy argument since if you didn't like that ""gay cowboy movie"", people automatically thought it was because you didn't like the film's subject matter as opposed to the film actually not being good. So whether or not you like this film is not because of its sex scenes but rather its story, characters and length. But I won't lie, the sex scenes, while not hardcore, are quite graphic and more than once you wonder whether it was simulated or not. But that's beside the point as the film succeeds by being an engrossing story and it was only in the last half hour or so did I feel the film lagged a bit.A film that's more centered on character than action needs to have some fine acting and reliable Tony Leung and newcomer Wei Tang are just as great as they should be and supporting characters are just as important to the story as well even if they're not given much to do. The cinematography is just as remarkable with art direction and lighting helping the film achieve a more subdued beauty than colorful flashiness like Zhang Yimou stuff.It's strange liking a film like Lust, Caution since it was great when you first saw it yet it's probably not going to be rewatched anytime soon. Look past the graphic sex and it's length (which I'll admit could've been trimmed) and you'll find a touching and passionate love story.",4,Trying to love how you can love...,1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,2890,"['have', 'been', 'couple', 'lately', 'where', 'film', 'hype', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'film', 'Whether', 'success', 'controversy', 'people', 'seem', 'talk', 'debate', 'more', 'one', 'aspect', 'film', 'what', 'film', 'story', 'what', 'trying', 'do', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Oscar-winning', 'personally', 'vastly', 'overrated', 'film', 'garnered', 'controversy', 'simply', 'showing', 'homosexual', 'relationship', 'when', 'really', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'anything', 'other', 'hand', 'Lust', 'Caution', 'love', 'story', 'man', 'woman', 'arguably', 'more', 'controversial', 'was', 'released', 'much', 'fanfare', 'media', 'attention', 'Too', 'bad', 'cause', 'film', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'probably', 'Lee', 'best', 'film', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', '.Wang', 'Chia', 'Chi', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'invited', 'work', 'theatre', 'company', 'who', 'more', 'patriotic', 'plays', 'opposed', 'classics', 'head', 'group', 'Kuang', 'considerably', 'patriotic', 'point', 'enlisting', 'actors', 'start', 'resistance', 'assassinate', 'target', 'Mr.', 'Yee', 'who', 'actually', 'traitor', 'helping', 'out', 'enemy', 'group', 'let', 'Wang', 'get', 'Mr.', 'Yee', 'life', 'allow', 'better', 'shot', 'Wang', 'Yee', 'start', 'getting', 'attracted', 'other', 'danger', 'being', 'caught', 'killed', 'always', 'around', 'two', 'find', 'caught', 'feelings', 'have', 'mission.Lust', 'Caution', 'different', 'controversy', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'was', 'sex', 'film', 'quite', 'graphic', 'nature', 'latter', 'was', 'big', 'issue', 'However', 'also', 'became', 'easy', 'argument', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'gay', 'cowboy', 'movie', 'people', 'automatically', 'thought', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'subject', 'matter', 'opposed', 'film', 'actually', 'not', 'being', 'good', 'not', 'film', 'not', 'sex', 'scenes', 'rather', 'story', 'characters', 'length', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lie', 'sex', 'scenes', 'not', 'hardcore', 'are', 'quite', 'graphic', 'more', 'once', 'wonder', 'was', 'simulated', 'not', 'beside', 'point', 'film', 'being', 'engrossing', 'story', 'was', 'only', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'did', 'feel', 'film', 'lagged', 'bit.A', 'film', 'more', 'centered', 'character', 'action', 'needs', 'have', 'fine', 'acting', 'reliable', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'newcomer', 'Wei', 'Tang', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'great', 'should', 'be', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'important', 'story', 'well', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'given', 'much', 'do', 'cinematography', 'just', 'remarkable', 'art', 'direction', 'lighting', 'helping', 'film', 'achieve', 'more', 'subdued', 'beauty', 'colorful', 'flashiness', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'stuff.It', 'strange', 'liking', 'film', 'Lust', 'Caution', 'was', 'great', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'rewatched', 'anytime', 'soon', 'Look', 'graphic', 'sex', 'length', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'trimmed', ""'ll"", 'find', 'touching', 'passionate', 'love', 'story']",N/A

It's the story of a young, beautiful Chinese spy who, implausibly, must seduce a Japanese collaborator in order to set him up for assassination. The question that is meant to keep you watching through endless, empty, boring, setup: Will the would-be assassin fall in love with her quarry, a man she is forced to bed?""Lust Caution"" has the production values of a superior melodrama: stitch-perfect vintage costumery: Chinese qi pao, Japanese geisha, and Western power suits and boxy shoulders; big, fat, vintage automobiles, shiny with chrome; and recreated cities of Japanese-occupied 1940s China. This film will satisfy viewers whose only demand of a movie be that it be luscious to look at.The problem is the ersatz gift underneath all those ribbons and inside all that crepe wrapping paper. The movie has no heart, and it has no head. The first hour and a half are unbearably boring and empty. I watched the mahjong scenes a couple of times to make sure I wasn't missing anything. They establish the superficiality of the Chinese collaborators' wives. That could have been accomplished much more quickly. The point of the scenes: look at this Chinese woman's perfect manicure, look at this big, fat ring, look at this silk qi pao. There's nothing there to engage anything other than the eyes.The film's two gimmicks: will the would-be assassin fall in love with her quarry, an utterly despicable man who, the film makes clear, tortures and murders Chinese freedom fighters during his long days at work, ""at the office."" The second gimmick: graphic sex scenes. In online reviews, some of the film's viewers assume that the act is not simulated, but genuine.Japan, of course, committed wartime atrocities every bit as horrific as those committed by the Nazis. They just committed their crimes farther away from Western news cameras. I won't detail here the nightmares the Japanese created in cities like Nanking; Iris Chang, among others, uncovered these hidden atrocities.""Lust Caution"" has chosen a monster for its lead. In bed, though, this torturer is one of the world's great lovers. His masterful feats of lovemaking are so acrobatic you'll not be sure if you're viewing a page from the Kama Sutra or a metaphor invoking ramen noodles.I'd really like to sit director Ang Lee down and ask him a question. Why did you cast actor Tony Leung, handsome, tender, and charismatic, as a torturer? Do you really think real life torturers looked anything like Tony Leung? Leung cannot hide the facial expressions of a human, decent, lovable guy. He is not the best choice to depict a man hardened by years of the kind of tortures that the Japanese performed. Yes, being a professional torturer shows on the face. Look at the faces of professional torturers. They don't look like tender lovers. They don't look like Tony Leung.All of this nonsense could have at least been entertaining, but it's not. ""Lust Caution"" has a single-digit IQ, no soul, and a glacial pace. In addition to be grotesque, it commits the cardinal sin of a popular entertainment.

1125834,ADKZOXAOV8EXD,B0010SAGHI,Doctor.Generosity,"[6, 9]","This film is highly regarded because of the famous director, Ang Lee, but at the same time many viewers find it hard to understand, even boring, inscrutable.Following up on Brokeback Mountain, which was for Americans, Lee made this for his Chinese public. This is what we see - in about 1940 a young girl is recruited as a spy to seduce and bring down the head of the Chinese secret police collaborating with the Japanese occupiers. The plot thickens as she gradually falls in love with him. At a crucial moment, she must choose where to place her loyalty. The story is disturbing and unsatisfying, the characters do not seem to explain themselves, and the acting is wooden. Why would this lovely young girl fall in love with her target, who is a traitor to her country, whose sexual relationship with her starts with a brutal rape, and who is daily engaged in torturing her comrades in the underground resistance? Her favoring her bond with Mr. Yee is difficult to accept - is it just the gesture of a simple girl who let her emotions get the best of her?This film cannot be understood without appreciating, as the director said in interviews, that it is culturally ""very Chinese."" It's also in the Chinese language with subtitles so we are certainly missing clues. There is a major historical and cultural backstory here which must be appreciated. First is the traumatic occupation of China by Japan from 1938 to 1945, an occupation marked by horrific atrocities against civilians including systematic sexual violence against Chinese women. Rape was used explicitly as a tool of terror and conquest. It is also significant that Eileen Chang - who wrote the short story behind the movie - was herself married to a man who collaborated with the Japanese. Also there is a common Asian theme that romantic love is associated with obsession, pain, tragedy - like those  Japanese music videos in which ""love"" is equated with tears. Finally, the classical Eastern ideal of womanhood - to accept a secondary role and sacrifice herself if necessary for her husband. All these themes are played out in the film.Much has been made of the NC17 sex scenes but these are more tedious than erotic. The lovers say nothing and show no real excitement nor do they ever smile. It is all heavy with symbology: the evil Yee as the occupier, the girl as China, even the start of their sex life as a rape which nevertheless does not stand in the way of the girl accepting Yee as her lover.It has elements of a spy thriller but really is not - it's about the the subtle struggle of the two protagonists as a mirror of national conflict and triumph, love intertwined with war. When she chooses loyalty to Yee, it is a kind of spiritual triumph for her - she was true to her traditional cultural values. Thus her way of life is proved superior, even though she as an individual is lost. It could be an aphorism from the I Ching brought to life. This echos the cry earlier in the movie, ""China will not fall!""The film has lovely photography of WWII Shanghai, with wonderful fashions and sophisticated upper class lifestyles. For 100 years, Shanghai was a cosmopolitan city, ""the Paris of Asia,"" which the producers reproduced meticulously.

1125835,A1AYEI2SNFPYES,B0010SAGHI,Dogville,"[211, 231]","Ang Lee breaks through again with a masterful adaptation of Eileen Chang's short story, Lust/Caution (like what he did with Annie Prolux's similarly brief story, Brokeback Mountain). While the hype seems to be mostly misplaced on the controversial acrobatics displayed by Tony Leung and Tang Wei in bed, Lee's storytelling leaves one breathless.The love story unfolds against the backdrop of 1930's Japanese-invaded Shanghai where tyranny and suffering were synonymous. Nubile Wang Jia Zhi played by Tang Wei joins the resistance movement and gets herself drawn into the role of a spy to crumble the traitor, Mr Yee. In between the espionage and wild climatic trysts, both of them unknowingly embroil themselves in love and deceit, much deeper than they would have liked themselves to.Tang Wei, as a newcomer to cinema, is impeccable. Her evolution from a wide-eyed country girl to a seductive temptress is enough to make the hardest of most men, in this case, the distrusting Mr. Yee fall for her. Wei acts pretty much on instincts and her body language does wonders at seducing the somewhat vulnerable Mr. Yee played by multiple-award winner Tony Leung. Wei breaks down in the memorable scene where she's talking to the resistance leader on her unyieldingly sacrificial role that is both a torment and insidious attack to her emotions.As usual, Tony has the penchant for playing dark brooding men and in this instance, an evil Chinese traitor. He does not act. His presence already commands attention as the cynical no-nonsense minister. The pivotal sex scenes, split into three parts, are not just there for visual enhancement. They actually convey the shift in roles between the two throughout their complex relationship. The raw emotions displayed on their faces were enough to convince anyone hard-hearted to think twice about the essence of love. I must say these are some of the best bed scenes you'll ever witness on film.Of course, the supporting cast of Joan Chen as Mrs Yee and Wong Lee-Hom as Tang Wei's resistance compatriot, Kuang Yu Min, is every bit just as spectacular. In the end, the story about love is bittersweet. You'll also see how fervent the resistance movement, which puts the enemy above self and others, was through Wang Jia Zhi's eyes. Lust Caution is 157 minutes' of rewarding watch that will linger on in your minds well after the credits roll.

The period, the characters, the history simply do not feel authentic. I think Ang Lee is one of those directors who learned everything he knows about life from the cinema.

1125840,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0010SAGHI,Ed Uyeshima,"[6, 6]","This review is specifically for the NC-17 version of this film.Lush and lugubrious are the two adjectives that come to mind after just watching Ang Lee's 2007 follow-up toBrokeback Mountain. On the surface, the two movies appear to have nothing in common, but they, in fact, share two attributes - both pivot their plots around a forbidden relationship, and both are cinematic expansions of acclaimed short stories. This time, the literary source is Shanghai-born writer Eileen Chang's1979 novellaset in China during the Japanese occupation. As adapted by Wang Hui Ling and James Schamus, the focus here is less on character development and more on a ponderous, drawn-out conspiracy where acts of passion threaten to upend an ambitious mission to kill a powerful official working with the Japanese puppet government. The net trade-off is a film that is sumptuous to look at and impressive in its meticulous attention to historical detail, but sometimes challenging to track and ultimately not as emotionally involving as it could be. Interestingly, the film earned the notorious NC-17 rating for the graphic sex scenes in the last hour, but Lee obviously includes them to amplify the desperate extremities of the principal characters. Running at an epic length of 157 minutes and with particularly fast-turning English subtitles at the beginning, it can often feel wearisome, especially in the methodical way the plot unfolds. At the same time, no film by Lee can be completely dismissed, and there are rewards to be reaped from his idiosyncratic approach.Through an extended flashback, the story spotlights a group of Chinese students who perform patriotic plays to raise Chinese spirits during the occupation. Inspired by the zeal of leading player Kuang Yu Min, several members of the troupe band together to plot the murder of Mr. Yee, a member of the Japanese collaborationist Kuomintang government of Wang Jingwei. Among them is a shy young girl named Wong Chia-Chih, whose family has fled China and in turn, finds herself at home on the stage. Her innate talent and quietly coquettish beauty are such that she is designated as the lure for Mr. Yee under the guise of Mrs. Mak, the wife of a businessman who is away in Hong Kong. The seduction seems to be working, but a first assassination attempt in Hong Kong fails. By chance, a second attempt is made years later in Shanghai, and the consequences become overwhelming for all involved, especially for Wong who becomes entangled in an erotically charged, emotionally confused affair with Yee. Much of the film's second half is focused on the evolving nature of their adulterous relationship, and at the same time, the motivations behind these characters are left open to interpretation. As the film progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult to empathize with their fates because the plot remains stubbornly opaque. Moreover, more discipline could have been applied to the editing as some scenes remain painfully lengthy, such as the fumbling, brutalizing killing of a government insider.Even with the flaws, the performances are uniformly strong. Tony Leung Chiu-Wai, Wong Kar-Wai's favorite leading man, plays Yee close to the vest as we see little of how he behaves in his official role. However, the actor conveys Yee's simmering menace with subtlety until he translates his explosive contempt in the bedroom. In a most auspicious film debut, Tang Wei looks very much like the porcelain-doll models in the vintage Chinese advertising of the 1930's, and she turns in impressive work given the challenging arc the character experiences. There is a palpable uncertainty in her portrayal of a seductress that serves the film's ambiguity well, and as the glamorously composed Mrs. Mak, she looks stunning in Lai Pan's period clothing. Smaller roles feel more contained within the storyline. Regardless, Asian-American pop sensation Lee-Hom Wang plays Kuang Yu Min with spirit, and the versatile Joan Chen makes Mrs. Yee a sharp background figure, especially when she rattles on during the meticulously lensed games of mah jong. All the sensory aspects of the production are impressive - Alexandre Desplat's lustrous music, Lai Pan's period-authentic production design, and especially the rich cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto (who performed the same duties onBrokeback MountainandBabel).Make sure to look for the 2008 DVD with the NC-17 version, which includes ten minutes of footage not allowed by the MPAA to run during the original theatrical run. Not just for prurient tastes, the scenes add a necessary layer of complexity to the relationship between Wong and Yee. Beyond that, the one significant extra to the DVD is a sixteen-minute making-of featurette that provides just a cursory look at the production including comments from the Lee, Schamus and the principal actors (Wei is barely recognizable as the same person in modern dress).",3,"A Stunning, Evocative Production Compromised by Opaque Characters and Plodding Pacing",1204934400,"03 8,

1125848,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0010SAGHI,Grady Harp,"[39, 48]","Ang Lee has the ability to transform simple stories about human relationships into epic films that somehow maintain the quality of intimacy and tenderness despite the grand sweep of his productions.  In LUST, CAUTION ('SE, JIE') he has once again created a symphony of a film with a script by James Schamus based on the short story by Eileen Chang, assembled a cast superb actors who convey the story's multileveled messages on the historic backgrounds of World War II Shanghai and Hong Kong using the sensitive camera eye of Rodrigo Prieto and accompanied by Alexandre Desplat's evocative East/West musical score. It is a visual triumph, a fascinating recounting of China's history about which we know little, and one of the most intriguing love stories committed to film.The film opens in Hong Kong focusing on a group of college students who form a theater group to present plays of 'significance'.  Young Wong Chia Chi (the luminous Wei Tang in her first cinematic role) is asked to join the theatrical group and she consents primarily because of her attraction to the leader of the group, Kuang Yu Min (Lee-Hom Wang, a commanding and handsome actor). Events of history alter the purpose of the art groups and they become a Resistance force against the Japanese occupation of China. The leader of the Japanese sympathizers is a Mr. Lee (Tony Leung, one of the most solid actors on the screen today) and the student group plans an infiltration into his home and life by placing Wong Chia Chi into his household. In residence in Mr. Lee's home, she learns to tolerate the constant mah jong games with Mr. Lee's wife (Joan Chen) and her gossipy girlfriends, only to await the moment when Mr. Lee will notice her and hopefully begin an affair that will result in inside information espionage. As the effects of the war tighten problems the Yees move to Shanghai and the troupe follows them: the troupe has become a committed political resistance force with plans to kill Mr. Yee and the cadre of men who support his siding with the Japanese.  Wong Chia Chi agrees to follow Mr. Yee's sexual advances and in short time they are caught up in powerfully erotic explosions of lust: it is during these very frank and very erotic lovemaking scenes that Ang Lee manages to reveal the inner aspects of each of these important characters, allowing the audience to see the complete picture of how lust can dissipate caution.  The changes that occur between the two characters set in motion a surprising ending, at once disturbing and understandable.Accompanying the DVD (already in excess of 157 minutes) is a 'making of' feature and a discussion period with not only Ang Lee but also with the stars and production people that is very solid commentary and for once seems pertinent to enhance the enjoyment of the film.  Some may find the extended lovemaking scenes too frankly sexual, but so much of the real grit of the story lies in the non-verbal, purely physical language that could only be understood in the way Lee decided to film these gorgeous scenes.  This is an important film on many levels and will probably become better appreciated with multiple views. In Mandarin, Japanese, Shanghainese, English and Hindi with subtitles.

Mr. Lee says in footage that accompanies the DVD version of this movie that he interviewed thousands of women before casting Ms. Wei for the part. She, however, is a delight to watch and has all the style and grace of a seasoned actress and more than holds her own with Leung.This film got a lot of misdirected press for its explicit, often violent sex scenes between Wei and Leung, calling to mind similar attention given to movies such as ""Last Tango in Paris"" for its groundbreaking sex as well. It has a seldom-given rating these days of NC-17 because of the nudity and sex bordering on S-M.Wei plays a young student who is a member of a resistance group intent on infilterating the home of Mr. Yee, a ruthless government intelligence agent. Wei's (Wong Chia Chi) mission is to seduce and then kill Yee. What begins as often violent sex turns into love as Chi is torn between her feelings for Yee and her duty to the movement.The suspense in this exquisitely filmed movie builds into an unforgettable climax as Mr. Lee proves once again that he is one of the greatest of contemporary directors, equally at home in an English language film as one filmed in Chinese.""Lust, Caution"" is one you will want to see again and again.",5,Another Fine Ang Lee Film,1206489600,"03 26, 2008",2008,1507,"['Based', 'Eileen', 'Chang', 'short', 'story', 'same', 'name', 'brilliant', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'latest', 'film', 'set', 'China', 'Japanese', 'occupation', 'early', 'days', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'Mr.', 'Yee', 'Tang', 'Wei', 'first', 'acting', 'role', 'Wong', 'Chia', 'Chi', 'Mr.', 'Lee', 'footage', 'DVD', 'version', 'movie', 'interviewed', 'thousands', 'women', 'casting', 'Ms.', 'Wei', 'part', 'however', 'delight', 'watch', 'style', 'grace', 'seasoned', 'actress', 'more', 'own', 'Leung.This', 'film', 'got', 'lot', 'misdirected', 'press', 'explicit', 'often', 'violent', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Wei', 'Leung', 'calling', 'mind', 'similar', 'attention', 'given', 'movies', 'such', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris', 'groundbreaking', 'sex', 'as', 'well', 'seldom-given', 'rating', 'days', 'NC-17', 'nudity', 'sex', 'bordering', 'S-M.Wei', 'young', 'student', 'who', 'member', 'resistance', 'group', 'intent', 'infilterating', 'home', 'Mr.', 'Yee', 'ruthless', 'government', 'intelligence', 'agent', 'Wei', 'Wong', 'Chia', 'Chi', 'mission', 'seduce', 'then', 'kill', 'Yee', 'What', 'as', 'often', 'violent', 'sex', 'love', 'Chi', 'torn', 'feelings', 'Yee', 'duty', 'movement.The', 'suspense', 'exquisitely', 'filmed', 'movie', 'unforgettable', 'climax', 'Mr.', 'Lee', 'once', 'again', 'one', 'greatest', 'contemporary', 'directors', 'equally', 'home', 'English', 'language', 'film', 'one', 'filmed', 'Chinese', 'Lust', 'Caution', 'one', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'again']",N/A
1125853,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,B0010SAGHI,Hikari,"[4, 4]","Chinese auteur Ang Lee is the chameleon of directors.  Who else has such a broad, genre-busting resume?  A period piece based on a beloved classic of English literature (Sense & Sensibility); a superhero flick (The Hulk); a meditation on dysfunctional 1970s suburbia (The Ice Storm); another period piece about two doomed cowboys in the love that dared not speak its name in 1950s Wyoming (Brokeback Mountain).  Lee returns to his country and language of origin with ""Lust, Caution"".  This follow-up to 2005's ""Brokeback"" explores lust of a more traditional sort between a beautiful young woman and a powerful man in 1942 Shanghai.  Complicating what would otherwise be a straightforward clandestine affair is that the man is a high-ranking official in the Chinese collaborationist government and the lovely young woman is a member of the resistance fighter cell targeting him for assassination.  Her mission:  get close, really close, to her target, close enough so that he will fall in love with her, drop his guard and therefore become vulnerable.  The plan works, but it works too well, as the Chinese Mata Hari finds herself falling for the man she is on a mission to kill.Not since ""The Last Emperor"" has China looked so glamorous on film.  Equally glamorous and a real find is its leading lady, Tang Wei, in, remarkably, her first feature film.  She gives a nuanced and gutsy performance in a grueling and often brutal role, as her character undergoes a transformation from naive schoolgirl to glamorous, capable espionage agent and sexually conflicted woman.  The graphic scenes of rough sex (featuring at least 47 positions from the Kama Sutra) were an integral part of the director's vision, but the violent coupling of this pair is profoundly unsettling.  Tang's high-ranking lover is played by Tony Leung, but not the Tony Leung of ""L'Amant"", the reminiscent love scenes notwithstanding.  This Mandarin-language film presents a challenge for English-speaking viewers to keep up with the subtitles, but it presents a facet of Chinese history that is rarely explored on film.  We have many films featuring the French Resistance, but none, until now, depicting its Chinese counterpart.

It's not a mere casualty in the very beginning of the film, the projection of a brief sequence of ""Casablanca"" worked out as a simple tribute. Besides, the movie reminds and brings us back to the famous film of Max Ophlus' ""The sorrow and the pity"" in which the hateful presence of the French collaborationism also permeated the ethic dignity of one of the most civilized nations in the world.On the other hand, the very idea of establish a handful of young aspirants of theater remarks the clever fact the art was  not divorced about what it was happening. And against the odds, a very young actress decides to infiltrate herself into the narrow circle of power emblematized by a cold and lonely man who embodies the driving force of the political repression.But as usually happens with the unpredictable human emotions, the love will make its appearance and will drift the initial plans.Ang Lee seems to have found his bliss with this admirable masterwork, because and although the film is visibly westernized with too many commonplaces, it would be unfair to ignore the careful illumination (that reminded me to James Ivory) the smart employment of the close-up, but the main merit of Lee is to carve in relief the camera is in last instance, a peeping eye (the most dramatic and intense scenes were filmed with an accurate game of light and shadows) to intensify and magnify the dramatic impact and so, to involve still more the spectator into the dramatis personae.A winner film whose running time (at least to me) didn't affect at all the strength of a well built script.

But they did not detract from the film either. This would have been a fine film without the sequences which made this film NC-17.The writing and acting were superb. My guess is that the writing team had many female members who understood the subtleties of the female sexuality and psychology. When the main female character gets kissed from her long-ago love interest, she quickly pushes him away saying ""you should have done that 3 years ago...why didn't you?"". That was real.This is a gripping and engaging film that makes you think. Most of all, you are taken into the inner psyche of the characters who are genuinely conflicted between lust and caution. In that sense, the inner conflict of characters isn't much different from our own relationships.My favorite sequence? It isn't the nude scenes. It is actually the sequence when the main female character sings for her lover and foe that visibly touches him. ""Only love that lasts through the hard times is true""...""we're like a thread and needle never to be separated"" she sings...That scene moved ME to tears and it was unforgettable.

Mr. Yee soon gets the upper hand in the relationship, and Ms. Wong is left pretty much powerless.It is beautifully filmed, as one would expect from Ang Lee, but the characters never seem to move beyond cardboard creations, and the movie plods to its obvious conclusion, with a few S&M; scenes along the way to spice things up.Lee still hasn't matched his early efforts on film, such as Eat, Drink, Man, Woman, despite the increasingly more serious topics he explores.",3,Not enough lust and too much caution,1222387200,"09 26, 2008",2008,1096,"['expected', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'given', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'all-star', 'Asian', 'cast', 'led', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'sad', 'say', 'film', 'short', 'story', 'compelling', 'enough', 'set', 'WWII', 'plenty', 'tensions', 'However', 'more', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'probing', 'look', 'complex', 'set', 'relationships', 'underscore', 'revolutionary', 'group', 'theatrical', 'students.It', 'out', 'group', 'students', 'trying', 'defy', 'system', 'only', 'protaganist', 'Wong', 'Chia', 'Chi', 'played', 'lovely', 'Tang', 'Wei', 'fall', 'love', 'Japanese', 'collaborator', 'was', 'supposedly', 'trying', 'seduce', 'ill-fated', 'move', 'Mr.', 'Yee', 'soon', 'upper', 'hand', 'relationship', 'Ms.', 'Wong', 'left', 'pretty', 'much', 'powerless.It', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'characters', 'never', 'seem', 'move', 'cardboard', 'creations', 'movie', 'plods', 'obvious', 'conclusion', 'few', 'S', 'M', 'scenes', 'way', 'spice', 'things', 'up.Lee', 'still', ""n't"", 'matched', 'early', 'efforts', 'film', 'such', 'Eat', 'Drink', 'Man', 'Woman', 'increasingly', 'more', 'serious', 'topics']",N/A

This movie wasn't so hot in the theaters and targeted to a selective few. This movie starts with the Japanese occupying Shanghai during the second world war and resistance group member Wong Chia Chi (Tang Wei) is on a mission to assassinate Mr. Yee (Tony Leung), the head of China's Secret Service who's also a collaborator with the Japanese.She's been groomed by a student theater group specializing in plays about propaganda and patriotism. Impressed by her acting skills she's recruited as a spy. She adopts the fake persona of a young wife with a lot of time on her hands, because her rich husband is away on business, and befriends Yee's gossipy mahjong playing wife (Joan Chen). She also infiltrates his bed, with the plan to seduce him and then hand him over to her patriot friends. He slipped through the net once before and now, three years later, she has him where she wants him. But lust gets in the way of her mission and she becomes unsure whether she wants to be his mistress or his murderer. There's no nookie until 90 minutes into the film, but it's well worth waiting for. Slapped with an NC-17 rating in the US, Lee refused to cut it but shaved off seven minutes for the Chinese censors.In Hollywood standards I thought the sex segments were graphic and realistic, bringing to mind the ""Did they? Didn't they?"" of the frantic couplings of Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland in ""Don't Look Now."" The smoldering lovers reach many graphic sexual climaxes, but fail to achieve equivalent emotional peaks. The intensity of their relationship calls into question Wong Chia Chi's motives considering she's played as a half reluctant participant, coerced into carrying out Yee's abduction by the amateur resistance group.Lee's late glamorous `30s Shanghai with its immaculate sets and women in perfect period costume gives Shanghai a romantic exoticism that belies the poverty and fear of the majority of its inhabitants.

And he draws extraordinary performances from his casts (again, see the interviews with Zhang Ziyi about ""Crouching Tiger"" -- the hard work she put in in effort to fulfill the director's apparent hopes.  Whether he did as she describes deliberately to ""force"" her to do her best I don't know; but if so it had a brilliant result).And in this: How on earth, as example, did he get such a performance -- especially but certainly not only in the sex scenes -- from the amazing lead actress Wei Tang in her first-ever film!?  And, of course, there is her obvious talent: how could an actress, in her first-ever film, so fully be the character as to perform the sex scenes, with other people watching, with such authenticity!?Ang Lee is the Chinese director to watch -- even more so than Zhang Yimou and Wong Kar Wai, and a slew of others.",5,"Others have detailed the plot, etc., so only a few words --",1242518400,"05 17, 2009",2009,2005,"['director', 'Ang', 'Lee.I', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'films', 'clear', 'have', 'seen', 'Eat', 'Drink', 'Man', 'Woman', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'now', 'Lust', 'Caution', 'interviews', 'especially', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'experiences', 'making', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'found', 'helloziyi.us.com', 'one', 'absolute', 'best', 'directors', 'business.His', 'range', 'phenomenal', 'none', 'three', 'films', 'anything', 'common', 'other', 'two', 'terms', 'subject', 'content', 'genre', 'Eat', 'Drink', 'small', 'intimate', 'poignant', 'family', 'comedy', 'consciously', 'substituted', 'food', 'who', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'lead', 'male', 'character', 'master', 'chef', 'rampant', 'sex', 'today', 'films.By', 'comparison', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'wholly', 'unexpected', 'wu', 'xia', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'also', 'revolutionized', 'genre', 'including', 'story', 'substance', 'not', 'merely', 'dispensible', 'bits', 'fill', 'pauses', 'number', 'martial', 'arts', 'fights.Then', 'Lust', 'Caution', 'wholly', 'unexpected', 'subject.Well', 'one', 'thing', 'common', 'films', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'stories', 'always', 'have', 'substance', 'depth', 'subtlety', 'extraordinary', 'performances', 'casts', 'again', 'see', 'interviews', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'hard', 'work', 'put', 'effort', 'fulfill', 'director', 'apparent', 'hopes', 'did', 'deliberately', 'force', 'do', 'best', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'brilliant', 'result', '.And', 'How', 'earth', 'example', 'did', 'get', 'such', 'performance', 'especially', 'certainly', 'not', 'only', 'sex', 'scenes', 'amazing', 'lead', 'actress', 'Wei', 'Tang', 'first-ever', 'film', 'course', 'obvious', 'talent', 'how', 'could', 'actress', 'first-ever', 'film', 'fully', 'be', 'character', 'perform', 'sex', 'scenes', 'other', 'people', 'watching', 'such', 'authenticity', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Chinese', 'director', 'watch', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'Wong', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'slew', 'others']",N/A

Wong, the film's young, beautiful heroine, is a rebel operative. She infiltrates the home--and kinky world--of a Chinese traitor who's marked for assassination.That's about all I'll offer on the film's premise. Much ado has been made of Lust's overblown sex scenes, and truthfully, I saw the film for this very reason. Plus, I'm a fan of Ang Lee (I won't see Brokeback Mountain though). There's nothing original about Lust, Caution, so the sex scene hype--on the studio's part--was a necessary exxageration. There's nothing at all spectacular about the sex scenes. Just a steamy pile of sliding, bending, and teasing--no money shots or anything that hasn't been suggested in a million previous--shorter, better--films.Lust, Caution's plot is also a leftover--a musty recipe of a million older films: the recipe of spies, deception, and ultimately, betrayed loyalties. This film could have been more effective--and sharper--an hour shorter than its hefty 2hr 35 minute running time. Once the plot spun itself out, once every conceivable atom was wrung out of the touch and go flirting between the principal characters, there was a filler of stock melodrama before the final payout, which in itself, wasn't much of a climax (no pun intended).Lust, Caution is a very solid film: good cinematography, lighting, acting, period detail, color, sound, etc. What this film didn't do--at least for me--was break new ground.

1125864,A3G262YMBW13UW,B0010SAGHI,"Joe L. ""J.L""","[2, 3]","I watched the Hong Kong edition of this movie (Region 3 DVD).  I heard that it is the uncensored edition.  Other releases in Asia was heavily cut.  I don't know if the US release will be the same or not.The story is about an assassination plot of the head of the intelligence agency of the Japan-backed puppet government in Nanjing, China. To the Chinese in that era, the government led by Wang Jing Wei was traitor to the Chinese people.  The target of the assassination was just one pawn in the whole situtation.  The female lead character (played by Tang) was a college student when her group failed the first amateur attempt.  She was later recruited by the real spy agency to approach the target again.The story is not very complicated.  But I think the performance by the first-time actress was exceptional.  In my opinion, the controversial sex scenes are necessary in the movie.  Without them, the audience has no way to imagine what this innocent college girl had gone through in her personal sacrifice for this mission.  Director Ang Lee skillfully brought out the emotional struggle in the mind of this girl.In my opinion, the best performance in the movie was when this girl sacrificed her virginity to gain sexual experience in order to fit her cover as a married woman. Then she found out the next day that the plan had to be dropped because their target was leaving town forever.  The helplessness and anxiety expressed when she heard the news over the phone was a first class performance.  Her personal sacrifice was all for nothing.  Perhaps due cultural differences, the Western audience may not get the same sensitivity to the extent of her personal sacrifice. Virginity was very important to a Chinese woman in that era.  Understanding the historical background of the Wang Jingwei Government (1940-1945) during the Japanese occupation of China may give a different perspective to the story.Tony Leung's performance was okay.

There is lust and caution in both, and their interplay is what this film is about.After breaking through to the American public with his excellent film Brokeback Mountain, Ang Lee continues to create another full length feature from tightly wound vigtnette. But this film is not quite as brilliant as Brokeback mountain, and while avid film-watchers will enjoy Lust/Caution, there will be a slight disappointment that the film wasn't more focused. The plot is simply too slow, too detailed, to engender a rising sense of caution in the viewer.What you will like: For a period piece, Lee has Shanghai down to a tee. The sets are truly a joy to see. The acting is also superb.  The movie's plot peak --when the protagonist Mrs. Mak, brilliantly portrayed by Tang Wei, breaks down and admits that her sexual espionage is making her emotionally vulnerable-- is the actual climax of all the highly choreographed sex scenes.

Indeed, pretty much all of the elements of a great movie. And yet.Personally, this tragic tale did not quite reach me on an intellectual level. For a start the street scenes of Shanghai were more like a studio lot than real streets. Although the producers had gone to great lengths to provide authentic cars etc, to me it did not seem quite right. I much preferred Shanghai Triad in that respect.Secondly I feel that the sex scenes, although germane to the plot were a little overdone and i feel that these will attract a certain element not known for watching movies with subtitles. Obviously, great pains had been taken to get these right but when it comes down to it, were all of them truly necessay?Most importantly, it seems to me that the background to the movie, the Japanese occupation of mainland China should have been a more central focus of the film. There was not too much involvement save that of placing the rebels in a context but by restricting it to backdrop it did leave the storyline somewhat hanging in the end.I wish I could say that this film kept my attention throughout but this was not the case. More judicious editing would have heightened the tensions which existed and not lost any of the emotional developments that were being traced.Well made? Yes. Clearly a labour of love.

Boullosa,"[1, 3]","Ang Lee's adaptation of Eileen Chang's short story, ""Lust/Caution"", is absorbing, emotionally engaging, contains superb performances, and is beautiful to look at.  It is also nearly three hours long and contains several sex scenes that are so graphic that only the absence of visible sexual arousal on Tony Leung separates those scenes from what most people would call hard-core pornography.  Whether or not this affects the integrity of the film, individual viewers must decide.The story follows the fates of a group of somewhat naive, patriotic Chinese university students during the occupation of China by Japan in the late 1930s-early 1940s.  The students band together and plot to assassinate their notorious countryman, Yee (Tony Leung), who is collaborating with the occupying Japanese by hunting down, torturing, and killing members of the Chinese resistance.  His gruesome torture chamber stands in stark contrast to the comfortable, hum-drum middle-class life he leads at home with his wife (Joan Chen).  The group of students decide to infiltrate Yee's personal life by sending in the prettiest of its two female members, the young, sweet Wang Jia Zhi (Tang Wei) to seduce him and set him up for assassination.  As unsuccessful traps of this kind have been set for Yee before, Wang Jia Zhi faces considerable risk as she assumes her cover as the wife of a local businessman.Wang Jia Zhi's motives for joining the group and for agreeing to be part of this dangerous plot are complex - she has been left in China by her widowed father, who escaped to England with her little brother before the occupation closed the borders.  He quickly finds a new wife in England and appears to be little concerned with the daughter who is now almost completely deserted, except for an aunt.  Grief-stricken and angry under her calm, cooperative surface, Wang Jia Zhi is ripe for a cataclysmic attachment. Completely sexually inexperienced, one of the co-conspirators clumsily initiates her so that, should she manage to get as far as Yee's bed, her disguise as someone's wife will not be revealed.As Wang Jia Zhi slowly succeeds in infiltrating Yee's personal life and attracting his sexual attention, it becomes increasingly clear that her success has as much to do with mutual recognition of the dark emotional tides each harbors, as her skills as a spy.  When the two finally embark on their torrid affair, the viewer is not surprised to see Wang Jia Zhi, simultaneously trying to resist, yet becoming ensnared in, her own trap.  Whether every one of the graphic sex scenes the film contains was absolutely necessary to convey the nature of the emerging relationship between Yee and Wang Jia Zhi is a matter of some debate.Canny and suspicious as Yee is, he ends by being completely taken in by Wang Jia Zhi's all-too-instinctive responses to his nature.  Tang Wei's performance as Wang Jia Zhi is superbly subtle and quietly moving.  She conveys misery and conflict with a gesture as slight as a bent head. However, as good as Wei and the rest of the cast of hapless students are, Tony Leung's performance is astonishing. The projection of the slightest, flickering shifts across his unemotional surface as he begins to take an interest in Wang Jia Zhi are masterful, and his slowly deepening love for her brings about the same unthinkable lapse in the viewer as it does in Wang Jia Zhi: we, too, begin to see him as human.  Her ultimate betrayal breaks a heart no one thought existed.  Wong Lee-Hom, as Wang Jia Zhi's  resistance compatriot, Kuang Yu Min, is also fine - his failure to act on the early attraction between them is another fateful turning point that persuades Wang Jia Zhi to cast herself into the assassination plot and the relationship with Yee.The sexual scenes, as noted by every reviewer, are intensely graphic, and because they are, they beg the question of boundaries in art.  Meant to straddle the limits of artistic verisimilitude, in a way these scenes have the opposite effect: their extraordinary realism brings the viewer up short and reminds us that these are actors.  Reflexively, the graphic nature of the scenes prompts thoughts about the the actors' feelings upon doing such scenes while people stand around and watch.  The moment such thoughts occur, the realism the director was trying to construct is shattered.There are disturbing rumors surrounding the film that suggest that the sex scenes are as graphic as they are because the sex is not simulated, but real.  This reviewer cannot confirm or deny the rumors, and the filmmakers have refused to clarify or deny them.  This reviewer hopes the rumors are not true, as otherwise they would beg even stronger questions about the director's integrity, regardless of whether the actors willingly acquiesced.These issues aside, this is a strong film, with outstanding performances, particularly by Tony Leung and Tang Wei.",4,Hoist With Her Own Petard,1203897600,"02 25, 2008",2008,4905,"['Ang', 'Lee', 'adaptation',

1125873,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B0010SAGHI,K. Driscoll,"[16, 17]","Lust, Caution is an Ang Lee film based on anovelof the same name, which is in turn based on a short story called The Spyring.  The story takes place in Hong Kong and in Shanghai during the late 1930s and early 1940s.  This of course was when imperial Japan occupied much of northeastern China.  Shanghai was ruled by traitor Wang Jingwei's collaborationist KMT puppet state.  It is a story about a group of students who plan to assassinate a prestigious collaborator named Mr. Yee, played brilliantly by Tony Leung.  The plot of the assassination is centered around using the attractive ""Mrs. Mak"" (Tang Wei) to entice him.  Mrs. Mak is actually the seemingly shy and unassuming student Wong Chia Chi.  The film begins by focusing on her finding the resistance's agents and her own rise among them, but it soon stays focused on her transformation to Mrs. Mak and her interactions with Mr. Yee.I just recently saw the 2007 documentaryNankingwhich goes over the infamous massacre of 1937, arguably the most horrific two to three months in the history of humanity.  I also recommend that documentary but especially as a precursor to the exciting espionage film we have here in Ang Lee's Lust, Caution.  I've read about the Rape of Nanjing before, but watching that first really fired me up to root for the resistance in this film and helped to enhance the experience overall.  Lust, Caution really does have it's share of unpredictable moments and the way it unfolds was surprisingly compelling and uneasy, but I don't want to give too much away.  Suffice to say, there are some remarkably intense moments in this film and I am not talking about the well-publicized sex scenes.The sex scenes by the way only make up about ten minutes of total screen time.  Altogether there are only three or four scenes that contain sexual content or nudity within this two and a half hour movie.  Yet, because the film is NC-17 we seem to only be hearing about those scenes, although the film's success has possibly encouraged similar content. I love when a film draws controversy, especially for perfectly natural reasons, but it is even better when it's a film that is effectively telling us an important and interesting story.  In fact, I'd go as far as to say the film has been denounced by some for its most beautiful moments.  The sex scenes are actually among the most compelling I've ever seen, perhaps it was just a little too close to the bedroom for the MPAA?  I would've given this film a heavy R rating for one pervasive murder sequence but even if you do happen to have a teenager you can control enough to keep them from seeing a movie they want to see, don't worry about the sex scenes.Ang Lee is incredibly versatile and lately he has created some hugely significant films.

The first time I went by myself, and the second time I took my husband, who was not initially interested in the story line (espionage and all). He also liked it a lot (though he did not have as much of a personal connection as I did with the film). I was like in a zone for a few days after I saw the movie. It really shook me to the core in a sense. A very powerful movie in and of itself, it moves me particularly because I am orinigally from China and Eileen Chang was one of my faovrite writers when I was a teenager book worm. Having grown up surrounded by the communisit propaganda, I found it refreshing to watch a movie so artfully done to create a theme about love, sexuality and loyalty. It shows how innocent and ignorant the young revolutionaries could be (something that was obviously omitted from our history lessons). This is a movie about powerful human emotions, like all the other movies directed by Ang Lee. I'm also happy to see Ang Lee sticking to making movies based on good, solid stories, instead of falling into the 'glitz overriding story' trap like so many other talented Chinese directors, Zhang Yimou and Cheng Kaige specifically.Ang Lee said that he made this film for the Chinese audience, but I also read that he was disappointed by the fact that the Chinese media focused predominantly on the raw, sex scenes. I can understand his frustration. I wonder really how the mainland Chinese will embrace such a tale. Eileen Chang was never a Communist writer. In the book and the movie, the revolutionaries were referred to as 'the people from Chongqing.' As the Nationalist Party was based in Chongqing at the time (and the Communists in Yan'an), the revoluntionaries in the book were not Communinist members but Nationalists. That sort of contradicts everything we have learned in history lessons about the Communisit being the main heroes fighting against the Japanese and the Nationalists (the Kuomingtang) being wimpy traitors. Because of these reasons, I doubt mainland China will allow the movie to be shown in public.But it doesn't mean the Chinese will be denied access to this beautiful film, thanks to the illegal DVD pirating industry. My sister-in-law in China has already bought the film (for a dollar) and watched it. Funny thing is she had very similar reaction to it as I did. My brother said she wouldn't talk to him for a few hours.I disagree with some critics who called Ang Lee 'indecisive' in directing the movie. I think everything was very deliberately done and Ang Lee was very clear on what he planned to do with the story. He said that it was one of his favorite stories written by Eileen Chang. I suppose if you don't like the story (such as some other reviewers), you wouldn't like the movie. But to me, the story can be interpreted in many ways, and Ang Lee has done a brilliant job conveying what Eileen Chang wanted her story to convey. The sex scenes (not in the book) are integral to the story, as Eileen Chang wrote, ""If the path to a man's heart is through his stomache, then the path to a woman's heart is through her v...."" The movie is certainly not for the faint of heart.By the way, the soundtrack is beautiful. I downloaded it from iTunes. Before I receive the DVD in the mail, the soundtrack will do. (But I wouldn't want a Chinese film that's dubbed in English. That's a crime. I'm buying it from somewhere else.)",5,My New Favorite Movie Of All Time!,1197244800,"12 10, 2007",2007,3480,"['saw', 'movie', 'twice', 'theater', 'very', 'unusual', 'someone', 'critical', 'movies', 'am', 'first', 'time', 'went', 'second', 'time', 'took', 'husband', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'initially', 'interested', 'story', 'line', 'espionage', 'also', 'liked', 'lot', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'personal', 'connection', 'did', 'film', 'was', 'zone', 'few', 'days', 'saw', 'movie', 'really', 'shook', 'core', 'sense', 'very', 'powerful', 'movie', 'particularly', 'am', 'orinigally', 'China', 'Eileen', 'Chang', 'was', 'one', 'faovrite', 'writers', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'book', 'worm', 'Having', 'grown', 'up', 'surrounded', 'communisit', 'propaganda', 'found', 'refreshing', 'watch', 'movie', 'so', 'artfully', 'done', 'create', 'theme', 'love', 'sexuality', 'loyalty', 'how', 'innocent', 'ignorant', 'young', 'revolutionaries', 'could', 'be', 'something', 'was', 'obviously', 'omitted', 'history', 'lessons', 'movie', 'powerful', 'human', 'emotions', 'other', 'movies', 'directed', 'Ang', 'Lee', ""'m"", 'also', 'happy', 'see', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'sticking', 'making', 'movies', 'based', 'good', 'solid', 'stories', 'instead', 'falling', ""'glitz"", 'overriding', 'story', 'trap', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'talented', 'Chinese', 'directors', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'Cheng', 'Kaige', 'specifically.Ang', 'Lee', 'said', 'made', 'film', 'Chinese', 'audience', 'also', 'read', 'was', 'disappointed', 'fact', 'Chinese', 'media', 'focused', 'predominantly', 'raw', 'sex', 'scenes', 'can', 'understand', 'frustration', 'wonder', 'really', 'how', 'mainland', 'Chinese', 'will', 'embrace', 'such', 'tale', 'Eileen', 'Chang', 'was', 'never', 'Communist', 'writer', 'book', 'movie', 'revolutionaries', 'were', 'referred', ""'the"", 'people', 'Chongqing', 'Nationalist', 'Party', 'was', 'based', 'Chongqing', 'time', 'Communists', ""Yan'an"", 'revoluntionaries', 'book', 'were', 'not', 'Communinist', 'members', 'Nationalists', 'sort', 'contradicts', 'everything', 'have', 'learned', 'history', 'lessons', 'Communisit', 'being', 'main', 'heroes', 'fighting', 'Japanese', 'Nationalists', 'Kuomingtang', 'being', 'wimpy', 'traitors', 'reasons', 'doubt', 'mainland', 'China', 'will', 'allow', 'movie', 'be', 'shown', 'public.But', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Chinese', 'will', 'be', 'denied', 'access', 'beautiful', 'film', 'thanks', 'illegal', 'DVD', 'pirating', 'industry', 'sister-in-law', 'China', 'already', 'bought', 'film', 'dollar', 'watched', 'Funny', 'thing', 'had', 'very', 'similar', 'reaction', 'did', 'brother', 'said', 'would', ""n't"", 'talk', 'few', 'hours.I', 'disagree', 'critics', 'who', 'called', 'Ang', 'Lee', ""'indecisive"", 'directing', 'movie', 'think', 'everything', 'was', 'very', 'deliberately', 'done', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'was', 'very', 'clear', 'what', 'planned', 'do', 'story', 'said', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'stories', 'written', 'Eileen', 'Chang', 'suppose', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'story', 'such', 'other', 'reviewers', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'interpreted', 'many', 'ways', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'done', 'brilliant', 'job', 'conveying', 'what', 'Eileen', 'Chang', 'wanted', 'story', 'convey', 'sex', 'scenes', 'not', 'book', 'are', 'integral', 'story', 'Eileen', 'Chang', 'wrote', 'path', 'man', 'heart', 'stomache', 'then', 'path', 'woman', 'heart', 'v', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'faint', 'heart.By', 'way', 'soundtrack', 'beautiful', 'downloaded', 'iTunes', 'receive', 'DVD', 'mail', 'soundtrack', 'will', 'do', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'Chinese', 'film', 'dubbed', 'English', 'crime', ""'m"", 'buying', 'somewhere', 'else']",N/A
1125882,A3CSDBDV77Z0VI,B0010SAGHI,lily t.,"[3, 4]","Ang Lee is a most versatile artist and has directed two of my favorite films, Sense and Sensibility and Ice Storm, which I far preferred to his much seen Brokeback Mountain and Crouching Tiger. The top reviewer, Dogville, has posted an excellent summary of the film, so I will merely add my observations.What I found tremendously moving about the film was the character and fate of the girl. She is motherless, abandoned by her father who is remarrying in England, living with an aunt who has little concern for her and is almost outside of  society in terms of her social standing. Chinese women in the first half of the 20th century, seeking to break out of proscribed gender roles and striving to be modern,  were trying on all sorts of stances from student to artist to revolutionary, and sometimes if authors such as Ding Ling are to be believed they were confused by the confusing demands on them and the outcome of their actions.Consequently the girl is never quite as much herself as when she is acting. In student theater she seems to have found her calling, and so when her group of friends becomes politicized, to capture the attention of the boy she is attracted to, she joins them with terrible consequences. They decide to assassinate collaborator Mr Yee and she is chosen to infiltrate his wife's social circle in order to get close to him.  Before they can act, the Yees leave Hong Kong for Shanghai. After the shocking assault the group carries out on Yee's henchman, she runs away only to be contacted by the boy three years later and asked to renew her mission. During those years her life has gone nowhere and once again she allows herself to be used by the handsome young man, who has never once intervened to protect her.She succeeds in fooling and seducing the otherwise incredibly cautious Mr Yee and what transpires between them is at the heart of the film. In effect, it turns out that the person who is her supposed enemy and an enemy of the Chinese people, who is a collaborator and a traitor and who she has vowed to maneuver into a position where he can be assassinated, is the only true connection she has made in the world and the most real thing that has happened to her, despite the falsity of the circumstances under which they have come together. He is also the only human being who has genuine feelings for her.The two principles, Tang Wei and Tony Leung [ chiu-wai -meaning little, as opposed to gorgeous Big Tony Leung, the lead in Annaud's  The Lover, were terrific in this  powerful  film which raises multiple, many layered  issues.

This movie had a lot of potential to become one of the best films of all time...but...it missed out on essential things that would have made it awesome.To make a long story short it was THRILLING, BORING, THEN DISAPPOINTING.THE GOOD ----------------------------------1) BEAUTIFUL CINEMATOGRAPHY(even though it looks like a Hollywood set, because of how clean it looked)2) THE ACTINGThe acting between Tang Wei (Wong Chia Chi/Mrs. Mak) and Tony Leung Chiu-Wai (Mr. Yee)was absolutely superb. These are two extremely skilled actors.3) EROTICAThe erotic scenes are well done in terms of the plot of the story and the acrobatic skills of the actors.4) THE THRILLSThe beginning of the movie was thrilling, I can't deny that. It really reels you in. I didn't even want to go to the bathroom in fear of missing any good parts.*[SPOILERS BELOW]THE BAD --------------------------------------1) STOPS MAKING SENSE  AFTER A WHILEEXAMPLES:A) UNREAL RELATIONSHIPThe relationship between Wong Chia and Kuang Yumin (leader of the student resistance) is poorly explained and developed. I'm not sure why she even joined the group and if it was because she liked Kuang, they never had a strong enough relationship to do all the things that she did for him.B) SEX OBSESSED OR DEVOTED ASSASSIN?Was it necessary for Wong Chia to have sex with just anyone in order to be prepared for Mr. Yee? It would have made more sense if she had sex with Kuang because it would show that she and him liked each other and had a relationship, as opposed to no real relationship.C) UNEXPLAINED MR. AND MRS.YEE RELATIONSHIPDid Mr. and Mrs. Yee have a sex life? What was the purpose of their marriage? Were they always cold to each other? This was unanswered in the film.D) LACKLUSTER ENDWhy didn't Mr. Yee question Wong Chia before he gave out his orders? This should have been explained or developed because of this the ending was disappointing and lackluster.2) THE MIDDLE WAS B-O-R-I-N-G.I have a long attention span, but this is a long film. Not enough was going on after a while to keep me interested. A lot of scenes in the middle should have been cut out.3) DISSAPPOINTING ENDThe ending was terribly disappointing leaving the viewer with no explanation or closure. Makes you wonder, ""And why did I watch this for 2 hours?""4) POOR CHARACTER DEVELOPMENTTowards the middle and end. The characters start to do and say things that they would not have in the beginning of the film. Particularly Mr.Yee. And what else did Wong Chia do before she joined this assassination plot?CONCLUSIONDO I REGRET BUYING THIS MOVIE?At first I did, but after I had days to think about it, Im glad I bought it because despite its defects, it is a beautiful film with great acting. And great acting is rare nowadays. It is good to have for a collection.

BUT THAT WAS JUST TWO PEOPLE BEING ROUGH WITH EACH OTHER. BUT IN ""LOVE, CAUTION"",IT IS AN ENTIRE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT, THIS ROUGH-HOUSING, THIS LUST THAT CAN'T BE LOVE BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN INCLUDES THE LIVES OF OTHER PEOPLE (I DON'T THINK MUCH OF THE LOVE, I CALL IT LUST), EXCEPT FOR THE FEELINGS THE RESISTANCE LEADER HAD FOR HER, BUT THN HE PUT THE RESISTANCE FIRST BEFORE HIS LOVE...SO LOVE LOST AGAIN...BUT LOVE OR LUST, ALL FEELINGS HAD TO PROCEED WITH ""CAUTION"".  I enjoyed this movie.  It is one for you to see but director Ang Lee irritated me or was it the writer, Ellen Chang, that did it, with that ending. I feel unnerved. I don't feel shocked, I feel unnerved.WE JUST AS WELL TALK ABOUT THIS NOW...(Synopsis) You are asked to do a job, to put your life on the line, even to put your life under the risk of torture. Your comrads do the same. They trust you; you trust them to do what they are suppose to do...It's on!  Everybody is going to do their role in the Resistance. Your job is to seduce somebody and you do that. Your job is to seduce them and gain their trust. They are lusting after you madly, not in love, but in lust. [That person will kill you, or even worse, will torture you and then kill you...if ANY doubt at anytime shows up anywhere, anyhow.]  But you do something in the end that put everyone in jeopardy. They gave you a pill that you could have used to save the others. You didn't use it. Then, there is this trinket, a beautiful trinket, and you change camps. The director and the author left a mature script and seem to turn toward immaturity, unrealness and silliness, as in measly contrived; I want to say, but afterall, this is a young woman but she grew up hard in the Movement really quick over the years. But her behavior was so wasteful. I can't believe the immaturity of the ending...I want to say ""savagery"" about the ending. It dampened an otherwise absolutely PERFECT movie experience for me.Mr. Ang Lee, the director, did this to me before. So now I'm confessing.  I was not put off by the sex in ""Lust, Caution""--the horrible man did a horrible job everyday so he wanted some kind of special sexual behavior making him, the character, more real. I wasn't put off by the sex in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN; I was put off by the same sort of thing with that movie as I am with this one and I'm confessing now that I am a hopeless IDEALIST or you can conclude that I have strong feminist values but I'm not a feminist: I love men. (Men, not males, men).  But I don't like the way the women were portrayed in this movie or 'BBM'.  I don't like the way they were treated (and then) how they responded to it. These movies were not woman-empowered, or woman sensible, at all.  'Lust, Caution' shows strong women who endure and then they are shown stupid (or missing sense) in the end, without explanation?  Ohhh yeah, there was (like) a smile on her face sitting there waiting to be captured to pay the ultimate price for her decision regarding a man who is going to take her life as if he is swatting a fly.  And then, walk around like he loved somebody--or, can we say his job came first?  Okay, I swear I can buy into their craziness together: lust will make you do some crazy things and throw 'Caution' to the wind...but when it involves the lives of your comrads, even Ayn Rand might think a bit of alturism is in order.Okay...so can I ask this outrageous thing: In China, have women been culturally cued (for centuries) to 'love' men before themselves, even if the man is brutal and will kill her instantly? Is 'the man' the ultimate value no matter what, in all circumstances? Is director Ang Lee, and writer Ellen Chang putting forth their own version of woman's fickleness--based on lust, as in the title, or love, as it is seems to be implied in the movie? Afterall that is said and done (in relatedness like this), experts do say that a child or an adult who is caught up in abuse or mistreatment or fear and danger will sometimes feel a bond (or love) for their captors who treated them like crap?  That ending doesn't make sense to me and I'v tried every angle. It is all about him or did I miss something? Is it the trinket that's important? Did it say love? Did it say he was no longer cruel?  No. That doesn't add up either. Did the trinket do something to her--did it cause her to tire of deception; then, why not use the one tool her comrads gave her to stop her personal pain and torture? Ohhhh,the waste, the waste, the waste, all that effort to be all squandered away like that...: It disagrees with my innards.

I mean have you ever been deeply, irresistably attracted to someone you wish someone else would kill?  Lust, Caution looks at attraction, loyalty, truth, betrayal, sex, pain in a sideways way in the context of Japanese occupied China during the late 1930s/early '40s.I can't say enough about Tony Leung's Mr. Yee.  He's a pathologically bad and extremely interesting character, a man who is expedient in the worst sense of the word, deserving of the death he senses stalking him, who is twisted and smart and trusts practically no one, and yet is afraid of the dark.  Wei Tang's Wong/""Mrs. Mak"" is a character Yee comes to trust.  And hurt.  And love, maybe.  Tang is so beautiful, and it's hard to believe that this was her first film.  Her face - especially her mouth - is fascinating to watch.  The other characters were very good (especially Joan Chen as Mrs. Yee), but this is principally the story of two people and the very messy and blurred relationship they had.  Ang Lee loves crashing boundaries, and does so in this beautifully crafted film.  This film, like Ang's Brokeback Mountain, also has a strong sexual component.  The sex, however, is less about eroticism then about the peculiar and dynamic relationship between Yee and Wong.  What do we give up for what we get?  Is it worth it?  Who's in charge?  When and how far do we trust?  How do we use the power we have over another person, physically, emotionally and psychologically?A few times I felt that the story was being drawn out just a little too long and that the getting to the end didn't require quite so much pain, but overall I very much enjoyed this film.",4,"Crashing Boundaries, Blurred Lines",1206576000,"03 27, 2008",2008,1683,"['Have', 'ever', 'loved', 'someone', 'wanted', 'kill', 'mean', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'deeply', 'irresistably', 'attracted', 'someone', 'wish', 'someone', 'else', 'would', 'kill', 'Lust', 'Caution', 'attraction', 'loyalty', 'truth', 'betrayal', 'sex', 'pain', 'sideways', 'way', 'context', 'Japanese', 'occupied', 'China', 'late', '1930s/early', ""'40s.I"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'Mr.', 'Yee', 'pathologically', 'bad', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'character', 'man', 'who', 'expedient', 'worst', 'sense', 'word', 'deserving', 'death', 'stalking', 'who', 'twisted', 'smart', 'trusts', 'practically', 'one', 'yet', 'afraid', 'dark', 'Wei', 'Tang', 'Wong/', 'Mrs.', 'Mak', 'character', 'Yee', 'trust', 'hurt', 'love', 'maybe', 'Tang', 'so', 'beautiful', 'hard', 'believe', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'face', 'especially', 'mouth', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'Mrs.', 'Yee', 'principally', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'very', 'messy', 'blurred', 'relationship', 'had', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'crashing', 'boundaries', 'so', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'film', 'film', 'Ang', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'also', 'strong', 'sexual', 'component', 'sex', 'however', 'less', 'eroticism', 'then', 'peculiar', 'dynamic', 'relationship', 'Yee', 'Wong', 'What', 'do', 'give', 'up', 'what', 'get', 'Who', 'charge', 'When', 'how', 'far', 'do', 'trust', 'How', 'do', 'use', 'power', 'have', 'over', 'person', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'psychologically', 'A', 'few', 'times', 'felt', 'story', 'was', 'being', 'drawn', 'out', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'getting', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'require', 'quite', 'so', 'much', 'pain', 'overall', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'film']",N/A

Bearing no resemblance to his previous films in themes used or in its direction, save for the amazing and beautiful scenes, this movie, as others by Lee, does what it intended to do: it explores characters as they are shaped by the idea, by the emotion and by the revolution love entails.Wang Jiazhi is a young student during World War II Shanghai. She joins a student group that plans to assassinate a high ranking official by the name of Mr. Yee. Wang, who becomes a spy, must change her identity, become Yee's lover and sacrifice many things to accomplish her objective. What she did not expect were her feelings for Yee. As each character explores the repercussions of their decisions, as well as the path where their actions have taken them, we, as viewers, see quite the treatise on the basic and complicated thing called love. The characters are savagely shaken to confront their innermost desires, their lusts, their emotions; they are displayed brutally in this film, as their actions and reactions are scrutinized and studied in this film. It is brilliant.It feels slow at first, but what we do not realize is that Lee is in fact building a bomb. As the tension builds, the inevitable comes to be and the characters face up to their own realization, we are simply in awe, at the edge of our seats, unable to breathe or blink, waiting for the end.

She is soon caught up with a group of idealistic young revolutionaries, in a plot to assassinate Mr. Yee, a high ranking official in the collaborationist government.  Posing as Mrs. Mak, the wife of a wealthy businessman, she insinuates herself into the family of Mr. Yee, eventually winning his trust and becoming his mistress.  Trouble is, the line between her passions and her pretense begins to slowly crumble, leading to questions where her ultimate loyalties lie.This is a gorgeously filmed and subtly acted story of love, lust and betrayal.  It does plod along a bit after a while, but for the most part kept me engaged and interested in the ongoing intrigue.  While there are several secondary characters, the focus is on the developing relationship, that begins as savage lust and becomes an intimate and tender bond.  Mr. Yee -- played by Tony Leung -- is both ruthless and refined, troubled and self-possessed.  Tang Wei plays Wang Chia Chi/Mrs. Mak -- and moves brilliantly between the wide-eyed curiosity and anguish of a bright young woman who has been abandoned by her father, and a demure but articulate and seductive Mrs. Mak.It is a shame that most of the attention this film received on its release centered around the volatile and savage scenes of passion -- for which this film received an NC-17 rating -- since it is a carefully produced and effective period piece and the sex is filmed to portray character rather than to titillate.  This review is based on the R-rated version which I saw on dvd, and in that version it struck me that the sex was filmed in a way that underplayed its eroticism.  Or, a better way to put that is that the scenes convey two people who are unable to achieve intimacy -- and the only genuinely erotic scene of love play between them was their final intimate scene in which they are fully clothed and she sings to him.  Only at that point did he let his guard down and when she touches his hand it is as if they are genuinely touching for the first time.",4,Loyalty overcome by longing -- in this sumptuously filmed tale of occupied China,1215043200,"07 3, 2008",2008,2163,"['Wong', 'Chia', 'Chi', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'woman', 'Shanghai', 'studying', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'university', 'escape', 'Japanese', 'occupation', 'home', 'city', 'soon', 'caught', 'up', 'group', 'idealistic', 'young', 'revolutionaries', 'plot', 'assassinate', 'Mr.', 'Yee', 'high', 'ranking', 'official', 'collaborationist', 'government', 'Posing', 'Mrs.', 'Mak', 'wife', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'family', 'Mr.', 'Yee', 'eventually', 'winning', 'trust', 'becoming', 'mistress', 'Trouble', 'line', 'passions', 'pretense', 'slowly', 'crumble', 'leading', 'questions', 'where', 'ultimate', 'loyalties', 'lie.This', 'gorgeously', 'filmed', 'subtly', 'acted', 'story', 'love', 'lust', 'betrayal', 'plod', 'bit', 'while', 'most', 'part', 'kept', 'engaged', 'interested', 'ongoing', 'intrigue', 'are', 'several', 'secondary', 'characters', 'focus', 'developing', 'relationship', 'savage', 'lust', 'intimate', 'tender', 'bond', 'Mr.', 'Yee', 'played', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'ruthless', 'refined', 'troubled', 'self-possessed', 'Tang', 'Wei', 'Wang', 'Chia', 'Chi/Mrs', 'Mak', 'moves', 'brilliantly', 'wide-eyed', 'curiosity', 'anguish', 'bright', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'abandoned', 'father', 'demure', 'articulate', 'seductive', 'Mrs.', 'Mak.It', 'shame', 'most', 'attention', 'film', 'received', 'release', 'centered', 'volatile', 'savage', 'scenes', 'passion', 'film', 'received', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'carefully', 'produced', 'effective', 'period', 'piece', 'sex', 'filmed', 'portray', 'character', 'rather', 'titillate', 'review', 'based', 'R-rated', 'version', 'saw', 'dvd', 'version', 'struck', 'sex', 'was', 'filmed', 'way', 'underplayed', 'eroticism', 'better', 'way', 'put', 'scenes', 'convey', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'unable', 'achieve', 'intimacy', 'only', 'genuinely', 'erotic', 'scene', 'love', 'play', 'was', 'final', 'intimate', 'scene', 'are', 'fully', 'clothed', 'sings', 'Only', 'point', 'did', 'let', 'guard', 'down', 'when', 'hand', 'are', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'first', 'time']",N/A

For some journalists, all they care about is if both main characters actually fornicated in this movie.  They have actually forgotten that the sex scene is simply a fragment of the movie & if we look at it as one whole piece, this is actually a true masterpiece.  The story brought us to Hong Kong and Shanghai during World War 2 and they are made as cosmopolitan as possible through portraying the diverse races living in both cities. It really brings us back to the golden days of movie making when Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Becall reigned supreme particularly in the fashion sense of the time.  Rather than boring the readers with the story, suffice to say that the sex scene is necessary to portray the main characters yearning to feel alive and being human yet again.  Because of what they do, Tony being the Japanese sympathisers whilst Tang being the resistance, they were at opposite ends of the spectrum and yet, they are more alike than you imagine.  They are good at what they do and the rule of the game is distrust anyone and that they need to be cautious.  Somewhere, somehow, there's a breaking point and that occurs when both of them collide at life junctions.  Ultimately, they have to face the consequence.

What always fascinated me about this talented director is his ability to transcend culture barriers and simply tell a tale, fairy tale or a fantasy with his own voice that can be understood by every generation and every corner of the world.  But his latest work (""Hulk and ""Lust Caution"") have somehow failed to impress.  While Lee is wonderful in explaining why people are the way they are or why they turn out the certain way due to events that take place in their lives, his indirect approach to the ""Lust Caution"" story seems scatter brained and unnecesarily prolonged.  The story is set in WWII China occupied by Japanese.  Group of young university students sets out on their own to assasinate the collaborator who is responsible for the death of many Chinese resistance fighters.  In the course of planning to assasinate the collaboator, the young rebels get into situation that alters all of their lives in a way that they will never be the same.  A young woman, attracted to a leader of the resistance group is thrown in the role of seductress who and is tasked to lure collaborator into a trap that will lead to his assasination.

The movie is based upon a short story by Eileen Chang, and it integrates complex themes of war, sex, love, and betrayal.  The movie develops slowly over the course of seven years. It centers around a young group of Chinese students who wish to assassinate a powerful Chinese collaborator with the Japanese.  Naive at first, the students make connection with the organized resistance movement and pursue their plan carefully and stealthily.  A young woman in the group, Wang, of little sexual experience, has been given the task of seducing Mr. Yee, a leading Chinese collaborator and the head of security for the Japanese.  Yee is cruelly efficient at finding and severely punishing members of the resistance.  He is also well protected.Ultimately Wang succeeds in infiltrating Yee's circle, and the two begin an affair.  Scenes of a violently sexual nature are graphically portrayed. Wang, out to kill, and Yee, out for lust, ironically fall in love, with devastating consequences to both.The lengthy movie develops slowly and the couple does not become physically involved until more than half-way through it. The pace of the movie builds up a great deal of tension, sexual and otherwise. During the course of her seduction of Yee, Wang tells her fellow members of the resistance that she has fallen in love with her intended victim.  But to no avail as the plot inexorably moves forward. An effective moment points to the relationship that might have been between Wang and one of her collaborators.The movie is well-paced, well-acted, and offers a convincing portrait of occupied Shanghai, with its brutality, vice, and repression, as well as with people trying just to get by and on with their lives.  But the core of the movie lies in the relationship between the two chief protagonists, and the exploration of the connection between violence, sexuality, and love. The movie ultimately is a tale of the mystery of the development of love in the human heart.Total time: 157 minutesIn Chinese with SubtitlesRobin Friedman",4,"Lust, Caution",1191974400,"10 10, 2007",2007,2163,"['Lust', 'Caution', 'directed', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'winner', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'set', 'Japanese-occupied', 'Shanghai', 'WWII', 'movie', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'Eileen', 'Chang', 'complex', 'themes', 'war', 'sex', 'love', 'betrayal', 'movie', 'slowly', 'course', 'seven', 'years', 'young', 'group', 'Chinese', 'students', 'who', 'wish', 'assassinate', 'powerful', 'Chinese', 'collaborator', 'Japanese', 'Naive', 'first', 'students', 'make', 'connection', 'organized', 'resistance', 'movement', 'pursue', 'plan', 'carefully', 'stealthily', 'young', 'woman', 'group', 'Wang', 'little', 'sexual', 'experience', 'been', 'given', 'task', 'seducing', 'Mr.', 'Yee', 'leading', 'Chinese', 'collaborator', 'head', 'security', 'Japanese', 'Yee', 'cruelly', 'efficient', 'finding', 'severely', 'punishing', 'members', 'resistance', 'also', 'well', 'protected.Ultimately', 'Wang', 'infiltrating', 'Yee', 'circle', 'two', 'begin', 'affair', 'Scenes', 'violently', 'sexual', 'nature', 'are', 'graphically', 'portrayed', 'Wang', 'kill', 'Yee', 'lust', 'ironically', 'fall', 'love', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'both.The', 'lengthy', 'movie', 'slowly', 'couple', 'not', 'become', 'physically', 'involved', 'more', 'half-way', 'pace', 'movie', 'up', 'great', 'deal', 'tension', 'sexual', 'otherwise', 'course', 'seduction', 'Yee', 'Wang', 'fellow', 'members', 'resistance', 'fallen', 'love', 'intended', 'victim', 'avail', 'plot', 'inexorably', 'forward', 'effective', 'moment', 'points', 'relationship', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Wang', 'one', 'collaborators.The', 'movie', 'well-paced', 'well-acted', 'convincing', 'portrait', 'occupied', 'Shanghai', 'brutality', 'vice', 'repression', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'trying', 'just', 'get', 'lives', 'core', 'movie', 'relationship', 'two', 'chief', 'protagonists', 'exploration', 'connection', 'violence', 'sexuality', 'love', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'tale', 'mystery', 'development', 'love', 'human', 'heart.Total', 'time', '157', 'minutesIn', 'Chinese', 'SubtitlesRobin', 'Friedman']",N/A

This was the same way I felt after I saw BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.  I didn't find either film to be thought-provoking or emotionally moving.  I think the problems I found with LUST, CAUTION were that the characters weren't well-developed and as a result, there wasn't much of a story.  I mean, why did Wang get involved with an underground student political movement group?  Based on one line that she said to Kung much later in the film, it could've been because of her attraction to him.  But why wasn't this scenario explored more?  What exactly did Wang see in Kung for her to risk her life?  Were there any similarities or differences that she saw in Mr. Yee?  What exactly was the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Yee?  I never really got a sense of that either.  What did he see in her, and what did she see in him?  Or, in other words, why were they together because you never really saw them together?  (It appeared Mrs. Yee spent more time playing mah jong with her girlfriends than doing anything with her husband.)  Did Mr. and Mrs. Yee have sex and if so, what kind?  Was it brutal like the kind Mr. Yee had with Wang?  None of these issues were explored.  Why didn't Mr. Yee want to interrogate Wang at the end of the film?  That wasn't explored either.

1125911,A2Z9L0JK0XRS61,B0010SAGHI,S. Spilka,"[4, 7]","The sex scenes are magnificent--explicit but not at all pornographic, or titilating. In a strange way, the sex scenes (where I believe the actors were engaged in real sexual acts) transcend sex. They become almost enigmatic spiritual experiences. The first sexual encounter is violent, but the others are passionate, at times even tender and loving. It is the actors' facial expressions, not only their bodies, that express their visceral need for each other, their sense of loss, their despair at the tragic circumstances that brought them together. I was amazed by the range of emotions that Mr. Yee's eyes conveyed during those erotic encounters: lust and tenderness, love and and cold hostility, rapaciousness and dependence. It is precisely this complexity that makes the erotic scenes so haunting.My second reaction concerns the attitude toward women that the movie presents. Obviously, in 1942 China women were forced to be submissive and passive. The women in Mrs. Yee's parlor are, indeed, silly and spoiled, dependent on their husbands' positions, money and status. But why would Wang, who is much brighter and more independent than they are, want to participate in the painfully humiliating and dangerous relationship with Mr. Lee? True, she is presumably doing it for the resistance, but her nationalist loyalties are, to me, never convincing. I think she really falls for Mr. Yee and, in a way, hungers for his cruel treatment, albeit mixed with tender feelings, as he hungers for dominating her. There is only one brief reference to Ibsen's Doll's House, which shows that Ang may have been somewhat aware of the anti-woman freight his movie was carrying. But it is never developed; nothing comes of it. Wang is not at all Ibsen's rebellious Nora. On the contrary, through a series of intoxicating encounters, she plunges from moderate self-esteem to utter self-defeat. And does so willingly.Let's put it another way. Yes, the hostility between the Chinese and the Japanese is strongly felt to this day. But we are once or twice removed from that political situation in the far East. Let's take something closer home. Suppose the movie described a relationship between a Nazi officer and a Jewish inmate during the Holocaust. Could we accept it? Would we watch the sex scenes with such a willing suspension of disbelief? I don't think so. Did the Jewish resistance ever send a woman to become the mistress of a Nazi commander? I don't think so. There is something very wrong and disturbing about the way the Chinese resistance movement operates in Ang's movie (or, actually, in the original story). Their strategy of sending Wang (albeit with her consent) to Mr. Yee's arms is brutal and nefarious; they become her pimps. And yet, they are portrayed sympathetically rather than as the cowards they really are.As I am writing this, I think that perhaps the movie deserves three rather than four stars. It is just impossible for me to reconcile the beauty of the erotic scenes with the brutality toward women that is intrinsic, not only to the social conventions of the period, but also to the movie itself, with the tacit approval of the director. At least, I could not find clear signs of the director's awareness that prostituting a woman (even for presumably honorable national purposes) is vile. There seems to be a disconnect between the lovers and the political realities that surround them, and so the love affair itself becomes a sort of a fantasy unbecoming a work of art, especially by such a brilliant director as Ang Lee.S.

Those are the adjectives that come to mind regarding Ang Lee's luxurious Lust, Caution.According to the negative reviews, this is far too boring, too sexual, not sexual enough, implausible, and painfully too long. It's an art house picture that liberal artsy types feel compelled to favorably review or else risk losing the title to their Prius. No doubt, if you went into this movie expecting a hot-blooded, breakneck-paced pot-boiler, you would be severely disappointed. Knowing Ang Lee, however, I can't see how one would expect that. Like so many of his movies, this movie is beautiful to behold, an emotional feast, and inevitably satisfying to my soul.The plot is secondary to the human insight and so is the much-ballyhooed sex. This is a movie about people and the pain of love. It is a delicious exploration of obsession, lust, love, anger, humiliation, duplicity, and duty. This is the type of movie you commit time and thought to, and there are far too few of them anymore.

1125915,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B0010SAGHI,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[18, 20]","A visionary and voyeuristic journey through the intriguing perspective of Chinese resistance fighters during Japanese-occupied Shanghai, Ang Lee's Lust, Caution portrays a dangerous world of love and betrayal, and the destructive effect such emotions hold on those involved. Lee's espionage epic provokes the limits to which some will go to obtain the elusive and deceptive elements of love, and though excessive in both its methods and its running time, a masterfully told tale unfolds with powerful performances and astonishing realism.In early WWII war-torn China a group of rebellious drama students led by Kuang (Wang Lee-Hom), and fueled by personal attrition of the times, ambitiously (and rather foolishly) concoct a plan to infiltrate the traitorous Mr. Yee's (Tony Leung) household and assassinate him. Young Wong Shia Shi (Tang Wei) poses as a businessman's wife and quickly befriends Mrs. Yee, allowing her to catch the attention of their target. But days of preparation and plotting soon turn to months and a tragic event destroys their efforts, causing the group to separate for several years. As Wong listlessly bides her time in Shanghai, Kuang reenters her life with a proposition to finish the deadly mission they had started so long ago. This time their amateurish approach has been replaced by Resistance support and Wong must give herself fully to the cause, rapidly erasing any trace of the innocent student she once was.Newcomer Tang Wei turns in an exceptional performance, baring her soul (and due to the NC-17 rating, quite a bit more). Her captivating presence draws you into her dire plight and as her involvement with Mr. Yee reaches distressing heights, she must adapt or be exposed. Her utter transformation to becoming Yee's lover provides a fascinating character study, though some may be disheartened to see where it leads her. Tony Leung carries the seemingly heartless and violently passionate Mr. Yee into engaging territories of unexpected destructiveness and leaden feeling, though he never draws the intrigue away from Wong's arc. The other plotting students and the mah-jongg playing women fill minor details, save for the ambitious Kuang who realizes what he wants only after it is too late.In Ang Lee's daring visionary style, Lust, Caution shows little restraint in its portrayal of sex, violence, and the tragic effects of war. Earning the daunting NC-17 rating, the violent romance between Yee and Wong is displayed as graphically as it gets and seems displayed only to emphasize the total immersion and transformation Wong undergoes to fulfill her role. A single scene of graphic bloodshed exists and adequately depicts the horrors of death and the mental, emotional, and physical strain required to end a life. The harrowing realism of conflict never abates throughout Lee's epic.It would be unfair to call Lust, Caution simply an erotic thriller; it is so much more a complex and intimate examination of love, obsession, and sacrifice in one of the darkest realms of humanity. Drastic transformations, a seemingly unrequited love, and a devastating betrayal build to a conclusion as tragic as it is unquestionably destined. A depressing emptiness permeates the finale, not because the treacherous journey witnessed doesn't affect, but rather through the crushing realization that no one wins in love or war.- Joel Massie, MoviePulse.net",3,Lust Caution Movie Review,1192838400,"10 20, 2007",2007,3385,"['visionary', 'voyeuristic', 'journey', 'intriguing', 'perspective', 'Chinese', 'resistance', 'fighters', 'Japanese-occupied', 'Shanghai', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Lust', 'Caution', 'dangerous', 'world', 'love', 'betrayal', 'destructive', 'effect', 'such', 'emotions', 'hold', 'involved', 'Lee', 'espionage', 'epic', 'limits', 'will', 'go', 'obtain', 'elusive', 'deceptive', 'elements', 'love', 'excessive', 'methods', 'running', 'time', 'masterfully', 'told', 'tale', 'unfolds', 'powerful', 'performances', 'astonishing', 'realism.In', 'early', 'WWII', 'war-torn', 'China', 'group', 'rebellious', 'drama', 'students', 'led', 'Kuang', 'Wang', 'Lee-Hom', 'fueled', 'personal', 'attrition', 'times', 'ambitiously', 'rather', 'foolishly', 'concoct', 'plan', 'infiltrate', 'traitorous', 'Mr.', 'Yee', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'household', 'assassinate', 'Young', 'Wong', 'Shia', 'Shi', 'Tang', 'Wei', 'businessman', 'wife', 'quickly', 'befriends', 'Mrs.', 'Yee', 'allowing', 'catch', 'attention', 'target', 'days', 'preparation', 'plotting', 'soon', 'turn', 'months', 'tragic', 'event', 'efforts', 'causing', 'group', 'separate', 'several', 'years', 'Wong', 'listlessly', 'time', 'Shanghai', 'Kuang', 'life', 'proposition', 'finish', 'deadly', 'mission', 'had', 'started', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'time', 'amateurish', 'approach', 'been', 'replaced', 'Resistance', 'support', 'Wong', 'must', 'give', 'fully', 'cause', 'rapidly', 'erasing', 'trace', 'innocent', 'student', 'once', 'was.Newcomer', 'Tang', 'Wei', 'exceptional', 'performance', 'baring', 'soul', 'due', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'captivating', 'presence', 'draws', 'dire', 'plight', 'involvement', 'Mr.', 'Yee', 'distressing', 'heights', 'must', 'adapt', 'be', 'exposed', 'utter', 'transformation', 'becoming', 'Yee', 'lover', 'fascinating', 'character', 'study', 'may', 'be', 'disheartened', 'see', 'where', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'seemingly', 'heartless', 'violently', 'passionate', 'Mr.', 'Yee', 'engaging', 'territories', 'unexpected', 'destructiveness', 'leaden', 'feeling', 'never', 'intrigue', 'away', 'Wong', 'arc', 'other', 'plotting', 'students', 'mah-jongg', 'playing', 'women', 'fill', 'minor', 'details', 'save', 'ambitious', 'Kuang', 'who', 'what', 'only', 'too', 'late.In', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'daring', 'visionary', 'style', 'Lust', 'Caution', 'little', 'restraint', 'portrayal', 'sex', 'violence', 'tragic', 'effects', 'war', 'Earning', 'daunting', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'violent', 'romance', 'Yee', 'Wong', 'displayed', 'as', 'graphically', 'displayed', 'only', 'emphasize', 'total', 'immersion', 'transformation', 'Wong', 'fulfill', 'role', 'single', 'scene', 'graphic', 'bloodshed', 'exists', 'adequately', 'horrors', 'death', 'mental', 'emotional', 'physical', 'strain', 'required', 'end', 'life', 'harrowing', 'realism', 'conflict', 'never', 'Lee', 'epic.It', 'would', 'be', 'unfair', 'call', 'Lust', 'Caution', 'simply', 'erotic', 'thriller', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'intimate', 'examination', 'love', 'obsession', 'sacrifice', 'one', 'darkest', 'realms', 'humanity', 'Drastic', 'transformations', 'seemingly', 'unrequited', 'love', 'devastating', 'betrayal', 'build', 'conclusion', 'as', 'tragic', 'unquestionably', 'destined', 'depressing', 'emptiness', 'finale', 'not', 'treacherous', 'journey', 'witnessed', ""n't"", 'affect', 'rather', 'crushing', 'realization', 'one', 'love', 'war.-', 'Joel', 'Massie', 'MoviePulse.net']",N/A

She agrees because she is attracted to the charismatic leader Kuang (Lee-Hom Wang). Then, World War II begins and much of their lives are changed by the threat of Japanese invasion. Flash forward a few years and Wang and the theater group have become a sort of small resistance force. They decide to try to infiltrate the inner circle of a prominent businessman, Mr. Yee (Tony Leung, ""In The Mood for Love"", ""Infernal Affairs""), who has been aiding the Japanese. Their ticket in? To make Wang into a seductive woman who will become a possible mistress to Mr. Yee. Wang becomes a part of Mrs. Yee's (Joan Chen) inner circle and plays mah jong with them on a regular basis. Every time, Mr. Yee is in the room, Wang cautiously flirts with him. Just as their relationship is about to bloom, the Yee's move to Shanghai. As the war worsens, Wang also finds herself in Shanghai and the resistance group has renewed interest in Mr. Yee; as the head of the police force, he has become a pawn to the invading Japanese, helping them maintain their hold on the Chinese people. Wang becomes a part of the Yee household again and their affair blooms. But can Wang, an inexperienced country girl, keep from actually falling in love with the man she despises?In ""Lust, Caution"" Ang Lee tries to push the envelope once again in another controversial way. The film has a very explicit depiction of sex, and also some graphic violence. First, it is sad that we even have to label this film ""controversial"" based on the sexual aspect of the story. Yes, there is a lot of sex and some of it is very graphic, but why does this automatically earn the ""controversial"" label for the film? This is just as stupid as giving ""Brokeback Mountain"" the same label because it depicts a gay relationship. I don't think adults who see this film will not see sexual acts they have not participated in. The shocking thing about ""Lust"" is that we are so used to seeing bodies grinding against one another before the film cuts to a shot of the couple laughing or sharing a cigarette that when we see an actual depiction of a sexual act in a film, it is a bit shocking.The sexual aspect of their relationship is also a natural extension of the story and doesn't seem all that gratuitous. Wang is trying to infiltrate the life of Mr. Yee, to become close to him, to earn his confidence and discover his vulnerabilities. If a man has a mistress, they will have sex, so it really shouldn't come as a shock to watch the two engage in sexual activity. But because we have seen so little of this type of explicit activity on screen, it is a little shocking.""Lust, Caution"" deftly mixes aspects of an espionage thriller with the relationship between Wang and Mr. Yee. As the events of war unfold, and people become more and more desperate, we understand why the resistance would make a second attempt to try to get at Mr. Yee. When Wang meets with the leader of the resistance, the first thing he does is hand her a cyanide tablet. ""Sew this in to your clothes. Just in case"" he instructs her. She willingly goes along with the plan, despite the danger, and accepts the tablet.As we watch Wang go from simple country girl to sophisticated city woman, her cover, it is more than a little amazing to watch the transformation into seductive mistress. She looks completely different and is so determined to be successful at her mission, she is determined to create a believable character who will charm Mr. Yee off his feet. Wei Tang is very good as Wang making us believe in her skill and determination. We see how all of these lies and stories begin to affect her. But she continues on.Tony Leung is also very good as Mr. Yee. Initially, his wife is present whenever he sees Wang, so he has to maintain a certain distance. But he is also the male figure in a society where women have less rights, so he doesn't have to be all that concerned about discovery. He seems to be more covert to protect the feelings of his wife, yet she clearly has a feeling for what is going on.I even liked Joan Chen, and I almost never enjoy her work in any of the films I have seen. In ""Lust"", she plays Mrs. Yee, a woman who realizes she has a certain amount of power, in her circle, and doesn't care about lording it over her `friends'. Her power comes from her husband's position and she realizes this, so when she begins to realize something is going on, she allows it continue for a number of reasons. Would she be able to stop it? Don't most men cheat on their wives?When Mr. Yee and Wang begin their relationship, Mr. Yee is clearly hungry for some sexual release. As Wang has little experience, he takes charge of this part of the relationship proving to be an ""aggressive"" lover, but she is a quick learner.As I watched the film, I realized how meticulously well it is produced. Every detail about the areas of Hong Kong and Shanghai these characters inhabit is completely believable. You really get a sense for this long gone era and the way these characters live and deal with the restrictions that come with the war.Unfortunately, this great attention to detail also points out a flaw in the film. In a story about two people falling in love, you shouldn't really be able to be distracted by the production detail. Especially an explicit film about a sexual relationship. There are a couple of things missing which seem to be key to elevating the film from very good to memorable.Throughout, we never really see why Mr. Yee is so hated by this group. They talk about it, and we can understand why based on these conversations, but we never see an example of it, of his power, of his menace, of his wrong doing. Because this is missing, there isn't as much of a feeling of danger throughout. When they are in Hong Kong, the group has to deal with someone who is blackmailing them, and this helps to create some suspense. But Mr. Yee is the main target and we need to see him do something causing someone harm or danger to give us a feeling Wang's life is threatened every moment she spends with Mr. Yee.Also, the trailer hints at Wang having feelings for Mr. Yee. The story seems to want her to be in conflict; initially, she is simply supposed to enter his life, win his affection and learn something allowing the group to take their target out. And this becomes a pivotal moment in the story. But we never get this feeling from Wang. She apparently does have feelings for the man she was supposed to simply seduce, based on some of her actions late in the film, but we never see evidence of this in her eyes, in her body language, so we don't believe she is ever in love with him.Because we never believe they are in love, ""Lust"" loses some of the eroticism it wants to sizzle our eyes with; without love it is simply sex. Watching sex without intimacy is less interesting.""Lust, Caution"" is a very good film, but it lacks the intimacy it wants to have to make it a truly memorable film.",4,"Sexy, But Some of the Romance

1125920,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0010SAGHI,Turfseer,"[3, 4]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***With excellent cinematography, impeccable direction, a haunting score and top-notch performances, why is 'Lust, Caution', such a ho-hum affair? For starters, so much of it is stretched out that we end up with only tidbits of compelling drama. This film could have and would have worked a lot better had about 45 minutes of celluloid found its way on to the cutting room floor.'Lust, Caution' is divided into two parts. The first part is set in Hong Kong in 1938, before the Japanese have occupied all of China. Leehom Wang does well in his first acting performance as Kuang Yu Min, a radical student at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. He conscripts a pretty, shy co-ed, Wong Chia Chi, to act in a patriotic play, designed to inflame the passions of a Chinese audience, who naively believe that they can defeat the Japanese, who are on the verge of taking over the entire country. Chia Chi is so successful in moving the audience to tears that Kuang becomes convinced that she could assist him and his acting group turned real-life conspirators, in a plot to assassinate Mr. Yee, a local party chief affiliated with the Wang Jingwei puppet government in mainland China. Kuang concludes that only Chia Chi can infiltrate Yee's organization and perhaps help facilitate his assassination.Chia Chi assumes the identity of Mrs. Mak, the wife of an import-export dealer and is introduced to Mrs. Yee, the wife of the intended target. While we're expecting some kind of exciting, assassination attempt by Kuang and his confederates in the first hour of the film, that never happens as Mr. and Mrs. Yee unexpectedly move back to Shanghai. What we are treated to during the first hour is a long-winded sequence of ""Mrs. Mak"" playing Mahjong with Mrs. Yee and her social circle, Chia Chi being deflowered by one of Kuang's co-conspirators in order to gain some skill in seducing Mr. Yee and the clumsy murder of Tsao, one of Yee's subordinates, who pays a visit to the Kuang and company as they are packing up their bags following Yee's sudden departure from Hong Kong.While the conspirators are supposed to be the 'good guys', Ang Lee makes the point that they're really no better than Mr. Yee, who both use Chia Chi as a sex object. When she's forced to lose her virginity in such a mechanical way, Kuang wants her to understand that this is her service to a greater cause--at the same time, he does nothing to comfort her and worse, express any deep-felt feelings he has for her. All this only serves to harden Wong who later betrays the group. The betrayal at the film's climax is foreshadowed by the group's awkward attempt to train Wong as a seductress--this is where she really loses her enthusiasm for the group's cause.The second part of of 'Lust, Caution, takes place four years later in Shanghai. Kuang now is an undercover agent for the KMT, which seeks to undermine Japanese occupation rule and the Chinese puppet government. With her past contacts with Mr. Yee and his wife, Chia Chi again is able to infiltrate the Yee inner circle. This time she becomes Yee's mistress and most of the film deals with Yee and Chia Chi's relationship. Yee is first depicted as a sadist as he rapes Chia Chi during their first sexual encounter. Gradually he warms up to her and by film's end, he's buys her a very expensive diamond ring. By concentrating on the sexual relations between the two, Ang Lee sacrifices any chance to develop Yee's character. He's played by Tony Leung Chiu-Wai who desperately tries to humanize Yee by showing his tender side during love-making (although he's afraid of the dark, Yee eventually allows Chia Chi to place a towel over his eyes, connoting some vulnerability). But we surely would have liked to know more about Yee--for example, what does he exactly do in his job as head of the secret police? (I think that's a lot more interesting than all those sex scenes that go on ad infinitum). Why not more like the scene in the Japanese district where Yee confides to Chia Chi that he really despises the Japanese and their cause is lost? Now that's ambiguity (and we needed a lot more of that!).As for Chia Chi, her failure to help the good guys, is meant to be seen as tragic. While Mr. Yee plays with her emotions, she begs the KMT to act before she becomes an emotional basket case. Due to 'strategic concerns', Chia Chi is told to wait and before you know it, she's fallen for 'bad boy' Yee, hook, line and sinker. Lee seemingly sees her as a victim of a male chauvinistic society. Others might view her as a weak woman who had a job to do during wartime and betrayed her confederates, resulting in their tragic death.Chia Chi warns Mr. Yee at the film's denouement and he escapes with his life. I had no objection to Ang Lee trying to avoid a sentimental, happy ending. Given the time period the film is set in, there actually weren't too many happy endings for Chinese people under the Japanese occupation. Nonetheless, it sure takes us a long time to get there. But even if you're willing to go along with the film's glacial pacing, one is struck by the fact that this is not a film that appeals to the intellect. Rather, it's a film that relies merely on the sexual chemistry between the principals without bothering to virtually flesh out any other element of their personalities. The same can be said for the supporting players (the conspirators) who we find out next to nothing about.For all its wonderful atmosphere, 'Lust, Caution' serves up only a few surprises; along the way, its characters remain ciphers who we can hardly become involved with.",3,More production design than psychological depth in period piece about Japanese occupied China,1304899200,"05 9,

What else are the bored wives of businessmen and government officials to do? Mr Yee, the husband of the group's senior member, returns home, perhaps from a meeting with the Japanese occupiers with whom he collaborates.Mrs. Mak, the youngest of the four women, remembers she has an urgent appointment concerning her husband's business. Mrs. Yee offers her the use of her car and driver. She goes to a coffee shop and makes a phone call. A long secret conspiracy is coming into play.The scene shifts to four years earlier in Hong Kong. We see Mrs. Mak is really Miss Wong Chia Chi, a young student left behind when her father emigrated to England. Chia Chi joins a student theater company who put on shows to raise money for the anti-Japanese cause. But Kuang, the idealistic young man leading the company, wants to contribute action, not just money.

The first hour or so of the film shows us a lot of Caution on  his part, while the rest shows more caution from her and a great deal of Lust between the two of them as she seduces him but is clearly falling for him as well.The sex scenes are quite graphic and somewhat violent, at least at first, but they are not offensive; and they are necessary for the storyline and for the character development.  Some viewers may be more disturbed by the brutal, bloody killing of a man that takes several minutes (about an hour and ten minutes into the film).What I found especially disturbing is that these student revolutionaries are so willing to kill others and to put themselves at terrible risk by doing so.It is a stunning story that makes me curious to read the text upon which it was based.",4,"Intimate, intense, and raw",1204761600,"03 6, 2008",2008,1077,"['wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'plot', 'summary', 'are', 'already', 'so', 'many', 'posted', 'here.Director', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'triumphs', 'again', 'lengthy', 'gripping', 'tale', '1940s', 'Shanghai', 'where', 'young', 'female', 'revolutionary', 'spends', 'years', 'trying', 'ensnare', 'man', 'who', 'working', 'Japanese', 'occupiers', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'film', 'lot', 'Caution', 'part', 'rest', 'more', 'caution', 'great', 'deal', 'Lust', 'two', 'clearly', 'falling', 'well.The', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'graphic', 'somewhat', 'violent', 'least', 'first', 'are', 'not', 'offensive', 'are', 'necessary', 'storyline', 'character', 'development', 'viewers', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'disturbed', 'brutal', 'bloody', 'killing', 'man', 'several', 'minutes', 'hour', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', '.What', 'found', 'especially', 'disturbing', 'student', 'revolutionaries', 'are', 'so', 'willing', 'kill', 'others', 'put', 'terrible', 'risk', 'doing', 'so.It', 'stunning', 'story', 'curious', 'read', 'text', 'was', 'based']",N/A
1125923,A2ZHSORK1HHYTT,B0010SAGHI,Willy D. Reviewer,"[12, 30]","Those who gave this film 5 stars were watching a different film than I viewed.It is advertised as ""Erotic and Suspenseful"", ""Provocative, Thrilling, and Passionate.""  No. no. no.LUST & CAUTION: This film is 98% caution, and 2% lust.  Proof: This film is 2hrs & 39min.  There are only two NC-17 scenes (that come late in the film) and each are around 2 min. long.  Four minutes out of a 2 & 1/2 hour film = 2% approx.And the film is boring.  A small group of college drama students decide to murder a political enemy.  Why do we care?  We never see the evil this man does collaborating with the Japanese, so we never root for the college kids to succeed.  Their basic plan is for one of the students to get close to him, become his mistress.  Good grief -- it takes forever (1 hour & 40 min.) for her to accomplish this -- and the journey's not interesting.  There is no conflict, no ""on the edge of your seat"" suspense, no ""oh my god hurry -- here he comes!""  Nothing.  Only beautifully filmed recreations of wartime China.  Vintage cars, vintage clothes, vintage people...vintage stores...vintage restaurants...etc.The NC-17 scenes: No big deal.  Other NC-17 films have been far more explicit with body parts and actual sex (e.g. 9 Songs, The Dreamers).  Re-edit those 4 minutes down to 2 minutes and you have a PG-13 or at the most an R rating.The real problem with this film is Ang Lee went an hour too long.  A third of the film could have easily been cut, and the story would have lost nothing.  It would have benefited.Like other Academy Award winning directors, Ang Lee became self-indulgent with his next film.One more negative: Unless you speak Cantonese, you are going to miss the multitude of facial subtleties by having to read the subtitles.  The lead actress, Tang Wei is beautiful and she does wonderful nuances with her eyes, revealing her thoughts -- but you will miss these as you read the subtitles.",1,"No, no, no.",1237766400,"03 23, 2009",2009,1918,"['who', 'gave', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'were', 'watching', 'different', 'film', 'viewed.It', 'advertised', 'Erotic', 'Suspenseful', 'Provocative', 'Thrilling', 'Passionate', 'CAUTION', 'film', '98', '%', 'caution', '2', '%', 'lust', 'Proof', 'film', '2hrs', '39min', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'NC-17', 'scenes', 'come', 'late', 'film', 'are', '2', 'min', 'long', 'Four', 'minutes', '2', '1/2', 'hour', 'film', '=', '2', '%', 'film', 'boring', 'A', 'small', 'group', 'college', 'drama', 'students', 'decide', 'murder', 'political', 'enemy', 'Why', 'do', 'care', 'never', 'see', 'evil', 'man', 'collaborating', 'Japanese', 'never', 'root', 'college', 'kids', 'succeed', 'basic', 'plan', 'one', 'students', 'get', 'close', 'become', 'mistress', 'Good', 'grief', 'forever', '1', 'hour', '40', 'min', 'accomplish', 'journey', 'not', 'interesting', 'conflict', 'edge', 'seat', 'suspense', 'oh', 'god', 'hurry', 'here', 'Nothing', 'Only', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'recreations', 'wartime', 'China', 'Vintage', 'cars', 'vintage', 'clothes', 'vintage', 'people', 'vintage', 'stores', 'vintage', 'restaurants', 'etc.The', 'NC-17', 'scenes', 'big', 'deal', 'Other', 'NC-17', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'explicit', 'body', 'parts', 'actual', 'sex', 'e.g', '9', 'Songs', 'Dreamers', 'Re-edit', '4', 'minutes', 'down', '2', 'minutes', 'have', 'PG-13', 'most', 'R', 'rating.The', 'real', 'problem', 'film', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'went', 'hour', 'too', 'long', 'third', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'cut', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'lost', 'nothing', 'would', 'have', 'other', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'directors', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'became', 'self-indulgent', 'next', 'film.One', 'more', 'negative', 'speak', 'Cantonese', 'are', 'going', 'miss', 'multitude', 'facial', 'subtleties', 'having', 'read', 'subtitles', 'lead', 'actress', 'Tang', 'Wei', 'beautiful', 'wonderful', 'nuances', 'eyes', 'revealing', 'thoughts', 'will', 'miss', 'read', 'subtitles']",N/A

Harder,"[9, 22]","I really was looking forward to this film having seen Tony Leung in ""The Lover"" and usually appreciating almost any film rated NC-17, but this film fails on so many levels, it's hard to know where to begin.First, it's L-O-N-G! Far too long!  At 158 minutes, a good 30-45 mins could/should have been left on the cutting room floor. There are SEVERAL scenes (including many of the sex scenes) that do nothing to further the story.  And speaking of the story, the plot is contrived and hackneyed; beautiful spy for the resistance supposedly falls in love with the subject she's trying to ensnare. And he, likewise, supposedly falls in love with her.I use the term ""supposedly"" since, while I may be a hopeless romatic, I find it totally unbelievable that a supposedly intelligent girl could fall in love with someone who routinely brutalizes her and bascially thinks of her as nothing more than a plaything and then could also save his life just as the resistance is going to assasinate him. Then, I also find it completely beyond the realm of comprehension how a man who is supposedly in love with a girl who gives him all the sex he wants and saves his life, could turn around have the same girl cruelly and brutally executed!The performance of Tony Leung is Terrible!  He might as well be a stick. He shows no emotion other than brutality and hate. This is a far cry from his thoughtful and touching performance in ""The Lover"". It is completely inconceivable how ANYONE could fall in love with this character.The ONLY bright spot in the entire film is Chiu Wai as the resistance spy. She tries her best to make her character believable and in most spots she succeeds, except when asked to do something totally incomprehensible; like falling in love with the despot and saving his life. She plays a college freshman and a refined Chinese matron with equial aplomb.But bottom line, even the sex scenes are not enough to save this film.
