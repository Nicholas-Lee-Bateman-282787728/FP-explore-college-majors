344147,A2GANR9I6XHTU9,6302888824,Amy Lynn,"[2, 3]","What could be more innocent than 3 boys camping in the backyard and telling scary stories? This movie is about 3 guys who go camping one night and decide to tell scary stories. Sean Astin, who plays a friendly jock named Michael and his 2 younger cousins, Kyle and Josh. Also dont miss the cameo by Kirk Cameron talking to Gordy through the TV. lol. This movie also has the big kid who acted in the Nick show 'Salute your Shorts'  He plays a lispy weirdo named Gordy whos obsessed with flies, he steals some kind of secret manure from a local farmer and then uses it on his flies- big mistake. Theres also a story about a kid who gets bullied, his teacher, 'Mrs. Titmarsh' & a janitor who turns into some kind of mutant/monster that lives in the bathroom of a middle school. Also a collection of short stories, sort of urban legends, a poodle in a microwave, rats in fried chicken & a man who dies during a haunted house ride.This movie is corny, its stupid at times, but its funny. If you love hilarious B movies this ones for you. If you like campy, if you like tongue-in-cheek then get it. Just put it in and enjoy it for what it is.  3.5 Stars.",3,The Willies,1156118400,"08 21, 2006",2006,1148,"['What', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'innocent', '3', 'boys', 'camping', 'backyard', 'telling', 'scary', 'stories', 'movie', '3', 'guys', 'who', 'go', 'camping', 'one', 'night', 'decide', 'tell', 'scary', 'stories', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'who', 'friendly', 'jock', 'named', 'Michael', '2', 'younger', 'cousins', 'Kyle', 'Josh', 'Also', 'dont', 'miss', 'cameo', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'talking', 'Gordy', 'TV', 'lol', 'movie', 'also', 'big', 'kid', 'who', 'acted', 'Nick', 'show', ""'Salute"", 'Shorts', 'lispy', 'weirdo', 'named', 'Gordy', 'whos', 'obsessed', 'flies', 'kind', 'secret', 'manure', 'local', 'farmer', 'then', 'flies-', 'big', 'mistake', 'also', 'story', 'kid', 'who', 'bullied', 'teacher', 'Titmarsh', 'janitor', 'who', 'kind', 'mutant/monster', 'bathroom', 'middle', 'school', 'Also', 'collection', 'short', 'stories', 'sort', 'urban', 'legends', 'poodle', 'microwave', 'rats', 'fried', 'chicken', 'man', 'who', 'haunted', 'house', 'ride.This', 'movie', 'corny', 'stupid', 'times', 'funny', 'love', 'hilarious', 'B', 'movies', 'ones', 'like', 'campy', 'like', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'then', 'get', 'Just', 'put', 'enjoy', 'what', '3.5', 'Stars']",N/A

The movie starts off with a few gross urban legends the woman who finds a rat in her fried chicken bucket and an exploding poodle. The main titles haven't hit yet and this movie looks promising. The first story was pretty good but the second story sucked. It was slow paced, boring, poor acting, and a story that really goes nowhere. The end to the film was a surprise but after seeing the second story, I was bored.Overall, a decent film but nothing that i'd call a classic.

Well I'll start with my criticisms, and then move on to the good stuff.Bad: The short stories in the beginning.  What is this?  They are boring and ridiculous.  The exploding poodle.  1st it wouldn't happen.  2nd even if it did happen, why would the dog explode AFTER the microwave cycle.  Then the old dude dying from being frightened, my ANTI-compliments to the editors, if you notice he has blood all over him BEFORE he actually gets  ""sprayed"" by the blood later.  Ok and the rat, I'm not even touching that one.  Moving on the first long story about the putz getting teased at school.  This is boring, pathetic and unimaginative.Good:  All right on to the good stuff.  This movie would get no stars if the following didn't take place.  The second story is about a kid who collects dead flies and superglues them to themed shoeboxes.  Who is this twisted chap you ask?

344161,A2W2ND26RMWZCA,6302888824,OX_Bigly,"[0, 2]","I got this from Netflix and man, this... this film is bad.I hate it when films have a great premise and fall so, so flat.The film opens as three kids are camping out in the backyard in a tent. They start off with bad ""grosser than gross"" jokes, and I'll give you a sample of the best of the jokes (which might not be saying much) - Q: What's grosser than gross? A: 10 dead puppies in a barrel. Q: What's grosser than 10 dead puppies in a barrel? A: 1 dead puppy in 10 barrels. You see how stupid this is - everyone knows the grossest thing ever is having your jaw wired shut then throwing up... amateurs.They tell a story of a woman who orders a bucket of chicken and finds a Colonel's original recipe fried dead rat. And because she wasn't an Androgum, she freaked out (you're welcome, fans of classic Doctor Who). They then tell a story of an old man who goes on an amusement ride that was in no way influenced by Disney's Haunted Mansion. The ride seemed &uuml;ber realistic with zombies with removable arms approaching trying to choke him. Jack the Ripper cutting a woman's throat (with green blood???) and an ax falling on the seat between his legs. He is found by ride operators... scared to death.Then there is a scene that isn't funny, it isn't even clever. I would put this up there with the scene from Toxic Avenger with the kid on the bike as far as being completely unnecessary. They tell a story about a stupid old woman who tries to dry her dog off in the microwave.... The scene plays on for way to long, and the ""pay off"" if you want to call it that, isn't worth it.Then they move on the the main two stories, ""Bad Apples"" and ""Flyboy"".""Bad Apples"" is about a nerdy kid in elementary school that gets picked on by three kids (one played by Jeremy Miller, aka Ben Seaver from Growing Pains). They proceed to bully and tie up this kid with a fire hose from the rafters. The janitor lets him down and tells him if he ever has any more trouble to tell him and he would take care of it for him. He runs off late to Miss Titmarch's class and in the middle of a test has to pee. The teacher is a jerk and ignores him. She lets him go and when in the bathroom he finds a monster. He promptly freaks out and runs back to class. the teacher doesn't believe him and tells the kid to go back to the restroom to clean himself up as he pissed himself running away from a monster. Rinse and repeat until the teacher goes with him to the boys room to see the monster and it kills her. Nerdy boy runs back and tells the other kids in class. The bullies don't believe him and they go and are also killed, but while they are trying to get out the nerdy kid pushed the water fountain in front of the door to keep them in. then just casually leaves the school. We then find out that the janitor is the monster.Two good things about this story: the boys room has Garbage Pail Kids stickers on the walls, and one of the bully kids calls the teacher ""Miss Boob Swamp"".""Flyboy"" stars Donkeylips himself Michael Bower as an outcast kid who in his spare time shoplifts and farms flies. He also plays pranks fellow students by making cookies with dead flies in. He also steals fertilizer from a local farmer (to catch the flies) His hobby starts to wear this with his parents and he gets suspended for the cookie incident. He goes by the farmers property to take more ""miracle manure"" and the farmer gives him some freely. He tells him there is an extra dose of his special ingredient. That night he has fly related nightmares including seeing the Mike and Carol Seaver talking about him. He wakes to find that the supper poo turned his flies human sized. and they proceed to come after him. The parents hear the noise and come in to find their boy with his arms ripped off and the Adolescent Deformed Taekwondo Houseflies standing behind them. They scream. and we see the farmer outside saying ""I told you I made it special for you"" We then see Donkeylips on a hammock being woken up by a normal fly landing on his face and he shoos away the fly with pincher hook hands.The film wraps up with the boys in the tent as the one kid's dad comes out to check on them. His son tells his father the other two kids don't believe the story about the janitor. The father steps into the light and reveals himself to be the janitor. who then proves the story is true by removing his human face and showing the monster underneath. The other two kids freak out and the son just nods grinning.This movie is not good at all.The ""Flyboy"" part is the longest in the film and it drags, however it tries for an EC Comics-style ending but falls short due to poor execution.I don't remember how I was made aware of this film. Most of the time, it's ""chain-link association"" - I would go looking for one film and see several others that look like they might spark my interest. But in the case of ""The Willies"", I can't remember what the alpha link was that led me to it.I can't recommend this film at all.Most of the people who know about this know about it from their childhood (not me, thankfully), so they look at it through nostalgia.But if it's either nostalgia or sheer morbid curiosity like me, just don't.I do tend to wonder: If this film was released in the

344163,A3JCK1V15VE6HD,6302888824,shannon jones,"[0, 1]","In this movie there are three short, 1-minute long stories and two long, half-hour ones. The story of the woman going into a resteraunt and getting a chicken-fried rat, and the old lady who dries off her poodle in the microwave are both based on commonly-told urban legends. I hadn't heard of the story of the old man dying on an amusement park ride, but that is certainly something I could see happening.The story of the monster in the school bathroom seems to me a hell of a lot like this one Stephen King short story,""Here There Be Tigers"", which can be found in his book SKELETON CREW. In King's story, a little boy asks for permission in class from his mean teacher, Ms. Bird, if he can go to the bathroom so he can pee. The teacher lets him go, but when he gets there, he finds that somehow, someway a tiger has gotten at the far end of the bathroom and is lying in wait. The kid is unable to use the bathroom, and soon another kid from his class is sent to see what happened to him. That other kid is soon eaten. Then our protagonist, desperate to p**s, goes in a sink, and then Ms. Bird comes and sees him. She promises to punish him as soon as she fetches the other little boy...and then heads to where the tiger is.The last story, about the kid with a bug obsession, I thought was pretty damn boring. It just took too long to really get going. However, I did think it was really cool when the kid has a dream that he turns on T.V. and sees an episode of CHARLES IN CHARGE where the main character is collecting bugs.",4,Good Movie,1260921600,"12 16, 2009",2009,1526,"['movie', 'are', 'three', 'short', '1-minute', 'long', 'stories', 'two', 'long', 'half-hour', 'ones', 'story', 'woman', 'going', 'resteraunt', 'getting', 'chicken-fried', 'rat', 'old', 'lady', 'who', 'poodle', 'microwave', 'are', 'based', 'commonly-told', 'urban', 'legends', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'story', 'old', 'man', 'dying', 'amusement', 'park', 'ride', 'certainly', 'something', 'could', 'see', 'happening.The', 'story', 'monster', 'school', 'bathroom', 'hell', 'lot', 'one', 'Stephen', 'King', 'short', 'story', 'Here', 'Be', 'Tigers', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'book', 'SKELETON', 'CREW', 'King', 'story', 'little', 'boy', 'asks', 'permission', 'class', 'mean', 'teacher', 'Ms.', 'Bird', 'can', 'go', 'bathroom', 'can', 'pee', 'teacher', 'go', 'when', 'there', 'somehow', 'someway', 'tiger', 'gotten', 'far', 'end', 'bathroom', 'lying', 'wait', 'kid', 'unable', 'use', 'bathroom', 'soon', 'kid', 'class', 'sent', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'other', 'kid', 'soon', 'eaten', 'Then', 'protagonist', 'desperate', 'p**s', 'sink', 'then', 'Ms.', 'Bird', 'punish', 'as', 'soon', 'other', 'little', 'boy', 'then', 'heads', 'where', 'tiger', 'is.The', 'last', 'story', 'kid', 'bug', 'obsession', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'damn', 'boring', 'just', 'took', 'too', 'long', 'really', 'get', 'going', 'However', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'really', 'cool', 'when', 'kid', 'dream', 'T.V', 'episode', 'CHARLES', 'IN', 'CHARGE', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'collecting', 'bugs']",N/A
344164,AADA02KT2O6I8,6302888824,wholeo,"[1, 2]","I bought this movie new, since the price was cheaper than used at the time. First of all, for any critics of the movie, nbr 1, it's a kids movie. #2, it's a kids movie. And finally, last but not least, #3, it's a kids movie. I thought it was a great little film. I'm sorry, but w/my ADHD I can't always remember names of actors, or at least, which one belongs to what name. However, the one who played the bully kid (Yes, that's right. Despite the fact that his name was mention a bazillion times I still can't remember it. If the train comes to the station by the time it leaves, I'll write it in...) I thought did outstanding. The lunch scene at school where he played perfectly on the psychobabble they teach kids (instead of common sense) to convince the girls he was reformed...the buildup of demented excitement in his face could not have been done better by an academy award winner. When he got home to find the love of his life gone, he played the part of a budding Michael perfectly as well. I know if that was my kid in real-life, if I couldn't get him committed like the day before yesterday, I'd be sleeping w/my door locked & my .45 locked & loaded w/all the trip wires & sensors I could muster up. I'm an old foagie & I've seen plenty of acting, on the screen & live. This kid did great. In fact I'd have him tailed to make sure he wasn't that way off screen! And the ending...well, he seemed to adapt to his adverse circumstances as he did prior to ""judgment day.""  I will say the overall ending I figured out as soon as...well, I leave that up to you. It was a nifty little film.  I wonder how many critters were injured in the making of this movie? I didn't see any disclaimers. Could this have been pre-PC? Either that or it was pretty realistic.Now, the print itself looked poor. In fact, the pictures on the back of the casing were more clearer than the film itself. I was a bit disappointed in that. I sent the seller a comment regarding that, to see if they had anymore that they could compare, or was that just the quality I was stuck with? Maybe I expect too much w/all the digital hi-tech stuff out there, & especially w/Echo Bridge. I have seen much better from them. It was grainy, like watching a worn out VHS or PBS thru the old antennae.However, despite the poor print (it's at least viewable), it's a fun movie to watch, altho some little little kiddies may find some things a bit squeamish (hence the PG-13). But it's tame compared to a lot of garbage they pump into our poor kids brains these days. For those kids whose parents sadly don't care what they watch, or who don't take time to watch stuff with them, there's lots worse than this. For the discerning parent (I know, I know, I know, I said it's a kids movie, & it is, but...) I would strongly consider taking the suggested PG-13 into account, mainly b/c of this demented lad's treatment of certain critters (I'm leaving that for you to figure out). To me & my childish 57 yr old ADHD brain, it's a 5-star movie, especially when, if I may be so bold as to quote myself (& how will you know that this quote was actually quote by me? Simply look earlier in this review...there lieth thine answer) ""compared to a lot of garbage they pump into our poor kids brains these days.""Oh, & let's not forget our little 4-eyed anti-hero earlier in the movie.  You see, having ADHD is like taking a trip, & leaving the farm!  When the cows are out to pasture, you'll see them in the future!
