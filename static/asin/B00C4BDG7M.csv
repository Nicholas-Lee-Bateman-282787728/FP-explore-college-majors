1641736,A1QN17E9RNFDYB,B00C4BDG7M,"Beacon Light ""keeper""","[2, 3]","This is a quality Hallmark film with plenty of interesting yet somewhat predictable turns in the story line.  Nonetheless it is worth an afternoon's entertainment.  Katie Leclerc enters the Beverly Lewis trilogy not as the deaf girl we are accustomed to in ""Switched at Birth"" but as Katie Lapp, the young Amish lead character of the Beverly Lewis novels. I found myself expecting her to sign.  Not in this film.  And she has good help from the supporting cast.Our story opens with Katie having left Hickory Hollow (to find out why she left you have to watch and listen attentively unless you read the book or saw The Shuning, the first in the triology): and then becomes first a restaurant waitress and later a servant in her birth mother's mansion.The story gripped me until the end; but left me hanging as to what happens in Katie Lapp's love life after she becomes the mistress of her mother's estate.  I confess that I knew the answer since I had read Lewis's third book, The Reckoning.  Movie fans, however,  will have to wait until The Reckoning comes out to find out. Hopefully there will be a filming of #3.  Otherwise this was a decent film proving that movies can still be good, entertaining, thought provoking, and enjoyable  without rough language, explicit sexual content, or graphic violence.  And there is plenty of dialogue if you like dialogue and I do.",4,Sweet story but not complete...,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,1371,"['quality', 'Hallmark', 'film', 'plenty', 'interesting', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'turns', 'story', 'line', 'Nonetheless', 'afternoon', 'entertainment', 'Katie', 'Leclerc', 'Beverly', 'Lewis', 'trilogy', 'not', 'deaf', 'girl', 'are', 'accustomed', 'Switched', 'Birth', 'Katie', 'Lapp', 'young', 'Amish', 'lead', 'character', 'Beverly', 'Lewis', 'novels', 'found', 'expecting', 'sign', 'Not', 'film', 'good', 'help', 'supporting', 'cast.Our', 'story', 'Katie', 'having', 'left', 'Hickory', 'Hollow', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'left', 'have', 'watch', 'listen', 'attentively', 'read', 'book', 'saw', 'Shuning', 'first', 'triology', 'then', 'first', 'restaurant', 'waitress', 'later', 'servant', 'birth', 'mother', 'mansion.The', 'story', 'gripped', 'end', 'left', 'hanging', 'what', 'Katie', 'Lapp', 'love', 'life', 'mistress', 'mother', 'estate', 'confess', 'knew', 'answer', 'had', 'read', 'Lewis', 'third', 'book', 'Reckoning', 'Movie', 'fans', 'however', 'will', 'have', 'wait', 'Reckoning', 'out', 'find', 'out', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'filming', '3', 'Otherwise', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'proving', 'movies', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'good', 'entertaining', 'thought', 'provoking', 'enjoyable', 'rough', 'language', 'explicit', 'sexual', 'content', 'graphic', 'violence', 'plenty', 'dialogue', 'like', 'dialogue', 'do']",Beverly Lewis' the Confession

I was not required to give a good review and all opinions are my own.I remember seeing The Shunning and that I liked it, but I enjoyed this one even more. I admit there was a bit of a predictability with how the plot will go, but it is still a well told story that kept my interest from start to finish. This is somewhat like a fairy-tale, so you have to believe there will be a ""happily-ever-after"" ending...eventually. Keep in mind, though, that this is part of a trilogy. When Katie's first love, Daniel, reportedly drowned in The Shunning, I hoped he would return in a future film. He does! However...Katie also has a new love interest. Does Katie choose Daniel or Justin? Will Katie return to her Amish upbringing? The Confession leaves us hanging until the next film for those answers, but I am eagerly anticipating it. The film is peopled with characters whose stories intrigued me and left me wanting more.Is it necessary to see The Shunning first? No. This film can be viewed as a stand-alone film without the viewer becoming confused about the story. For those who have seen the previous film, there are different actors in some roles (including Katie), but they are true to the characters you know. This is a family friendly drama and the faith aspect is touched on, but is not the main focus. I am not a fan of ""sappy"" movies whose major purpose is to make people cry, and am happy to say that while The Confession has the ""tug at your heart"" moments, it's not the emotional manipulation that annoys me.The film, directed by Michael Landon Jr. and written by Michael Landon Jr. and Brian Bird is based on the book by Beverly Lewis.",4,The Confession,1371859200,"06 22, 2013",2013,1739,"['Disclosure', 'received', 'copy', 'Confession', 'Edify', 'Media', 'Inc.', 'review', 'purposes', 'only', 'was', 'not', 'required', 'give', 'good', 'review', 'opinions', 'are', 'own.I', 'remember', 'seeing', 'Shunning', 'liked', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'even', 'more', 'admit', 'was', 'bit', 'predictability', 'how', 'plot', 'will', 'go', 'still', 'well', 'told', 'story', 'kept', 'interest', 'start', 'finish', 'somewhat', 'fairy-tale', 'have', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'happily-ever-after', 'ending', 'eventually', 'Keep', 'mind', 'though', 'part', 'trilogy', 'When', 'Katie', 'first', 'love', 'Daniel', 'reportedly', 'drowned', 'Shunning', 'hoped', 'would', 'return', 'future', 'film', 'However', 'Katie', 'also', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'Does', 'Katie', 'choose', 'Daniel', 'Justin', 'Will', 'Katie', 'return', 'Amish', 'upbringing', 'Confession', 'hanging', 'next', 'film', 'answers', 'am', 'eagerly', 'anticipating', 'film', 'peopled', 'characters', 'stories', 'intrigued', 'left', 'wanting', 'more.Is', 'necessary', 'see', 'Shunning', 'first', 'No', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'stand-alone', 'film', 'viewer', 'becoming', 'confused', 'story', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'previous', 'film', 'are', 'different', 'actors', 'roles', 'including', 'Katie', 'are', 'true', 'characters', 'know', 'family', 'friendly', 'drama', 'faith', 'aspect', 'touched', 'not', 'main', 'focus', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'sappy', 'movies', 'major', 'purpose', 'make', 'people', 'cry', 'am', 'happy', 'say', 'Confession', 'tug', 'heart', 'moments', 'not', 'emotional', 'manipulation', 'me.The', 'film', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'Jr.', 'written', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'Jr.', 'Brian', 'Bird', 'based', 'book', 'Beverly', 'Lewis']",Beverly Lewis' the Confession

1641760,A1LF4NXBKM5W01,B00C4BDG7M,marsdaman,"[2, 5]","A real feel good movie that has real promise for being really great, but parts in the movie keep it from greatness!Sherry Stringfield from Guiding Light and ER is a very wealthy mother of a long-lost daughter which she gave up for adoption(this in itself makes no sense--she left the Amish world and ""supposedly"" could live without being a mother to her daughter when a woman has the kind of heart Stringfield has OR Even if Stringfield's character left her daughter there from a teligious instruction standpoint, still, she would not have any problem finding her when she[mother] was looking a few years back; she[daughter] was still with the Amish community back then--finding her daughter was what this movie claims Stringfield's character had trouble doing). Now, her daughter is looking for her, too(who is no problem to find--I mentioned she was rich). Tragically, this reunion is as bittersweet as one can be with her dying of cancer soon. Stringfield's(Mayfield-Bennett) husband is financially down the toilet and needs money in a big way. She is sweet--denoting an Amish background--but not as gullible as most movies would normally write her character to be, but is quite the detective(knows plenty and mentally quick--but has a poker face demeanor until the timing is right). He finds out that she will be cutting him out due to his gambling and inresponsibility. So, he comes up with a genius plan to solve his problems; he knows she is looking for her daughter and knows that he isn't going to inherit enough of her estate, so he hires a young woman to play the part(looks enough like the true daughter, but different hair and eye color[Amish seem like they would frown on something like that which would be instilled in her since she was little; this would indicate deception--as in--she wasn't really Amish] than she was born with--any parent[knowing their daughters real hair and eye color] would notice this in a heartbeat; the real daughter wouldn't have changed her hair/eye color; the mother would know that about Amish life; verdict: geometric proof wise the imposter was fake from the jump]. Then, the true daughter arrives to her husband's dismay(he's not gullible, either; he quickly picks up who she is by how she reacts to certain stimuli). She(servant) slowly starts a romance--Amish style(very clean)--with a dashing young man working on the property. She is just the nicest young woman that anyone would want their son to marry. Since she's so sweet and gullible and even though she knows about his ""shell game""(a telephone conversation they had earlier) afoot, she can't bring her heart to tell her due to her mother's illness which her stepfather surely emphasizes to her. Now then, an old lover(posing to be the true daughter's cousin--a promise he made to her adoptive mother, not to make waves for her) comes along to find her. When he gets there--he seems disinterested bc the ""mole"" is there instead(he should have talked then to eliminate the deception: that was a problem for me; it is just not natural behavior).  He has a conversation with the imposter woman as if it is truly his cousin almost(no joy there at all from either); Mayfield-Bennett(mother) is there observing this ""reunion"". I won't tell any more, only that she--like a detective--deciphers the game and there's a link to a possible trilogy movie(did not like how it ended; kind of sloppy; more of an ending for a book or movie already here and to be aired soon). I gave a 3(I have no bias and have never read the book), but I felt that some parts just didn't add up for me and it could have been conceptually better.

I was a huge fan of Michael Landon and figured Little House on The Prairie is a show I grew up loving, let's see what Pa's boy has learned!The Confession has nothing to do with the 1800s as the Laura Ingalls Wilder series but it has as much heart as any Little House on The Prairie show that I grew up crying over.Socialite Laura, is dying. She has a progressive form of cancer. On her quest to get her life in order she had set out to find a daughter she gave up to be raised by an Amish family in Lancaster. Now hearing that her cancer has progressed she is preparing for the end.  Katie hears her birth mother was looking for her and heads to NY to find her only to be informed that Laura has already passed, thanks to Laura's selfish husband who has a plan of his own. His problems have gotten him in some hot water and he needs all of Laura's money.  Thanks to a well meaning NY friend with a terrible fake accent (there were many poorly acted fake accents), Katie is reassured that if a socialite had passed it would be all over the news and someone is lying. Sooo...Katie sets out to meet her momma.Things take an interesting turn when Katie arrives and finds out that Laura's daughter has already arrived.Back in Lancaster, Katie's family is dealing with the return of an old friend while the modern world tries to infiltrate their very beliefs as and Amish family.The movie moves quickly and while there are a few plot oddities that are unexplainable but would give the whole movie away if I were to list them. I didn't hate it.The things that may turn viewers off:Katie leaves her Amish family for the lavish life style seemingly quick.Laura figures the deceit going on under her roof and explains it away with a letter Katie sent out to her Amish family. You really need to piece it together and remember what Katie had written to her parents.The ending was God awful.

Katie Lapp discovered she was adopted by her Amish family. Her Amish parents have tried to keep her apart from her birth mother, but now she wants to learn the truth about her birth. Her birth mother is a New York socialite named Laura who is dying of cancer and her last wish is to get to know Katie. Her husband has a serious gambling problem and he's so worried about the real daughter taking his inheritance, he hires someone to impersonate Katie. There is also a little love triangle thrown in. Katie finds herself torn between a dashing businessman and her childhood sweetheart.I enjoyed this movie but it wasn't quite as good as The Shunning and there was a lot left out from the book version.

Elliott ""**Nicole**""","[1, 1]","Movies that end on cliff hangers always leave me waiting anxiously for the next one--and as I mentioned The Shunning did just that so I was super excited when I found out that the next movie in the series, Beverly Lewis' the Confession, was finally here! Since watching the movies I have picked up two of the books in the series, but I'm waiting to get all three before I start reading them-so I don't have the ability to compare them to the books (yet). I've learned I like reading the books after movies though-since that way movies aren't a let down!Once again Halmark delivers a movie that is touching, fun, and very family friendly. In the Confession Katie continues her hunt for her birth mother before it's too late. In an interesting twist it seems she does find her--but is it too late for other reasons? This movie kept me once again on the edge of my seat, wanting to explain what was going on to the characters as I waited for everything to come together.The infamous love triangle kind of, sort of, begins to raise it's head but much less than the movies description would have you to think it does--I will be interested to see how that will develop in the last movie in the series!There were a few things about this movie that will keep me from giving it a 5 star rating. It always bothers me when Halmark flip flops between actors and actresses and expect us to not realize it--I would love it if they could latch people into deals if they know there will be 3 movies in a series--especially the main characters. Just a small pet peeve of mine, however! Also I felt like things were very rushed along--I still don't ""get"" how one of the crucial moments in the movie came into play because a big mystery that was revealed was glossed over quickly when it came to explaining how it was found out. I'm sure in the book it goes into much more detail-and it would have been worth it to expound a little in the movie.Overall, however, I really did enjoy this movie! The acting was very good and caused me to tear up, the cinematography was well done, and it didn't have a low budget feel to it--which Halmark is usually very good about. Once again it's perfect for a chick flick night with the girls that even your daughter will enjoy so in spite of the few nit picky things I'd definitely recommend it!Legalese Disclosure Nonsense: It wouldn't be nice to send me one movie and not another, so I was very happy when I received The Confession to review.

Beverly Lewis is one of the best selling authors on Amish fiction and has been blessed enough to not only have one of her famous series made into a movie with The Shunning but now the second in the The Heritage of Lancaster County Series, The Confession is now ready to be released on DVD on June 11th.In this latest movie, we once again follow Katie Lapp (Katie Leclerc, TV's ""Switched at Birth), who we left off in The Shunning learning that she was adopted by an Amish couple and was born English. Her birth mother was searching for Katie but her Amish parents kept both of them apart. Only when learning that her birth mother was dying of cancer, did Katie's Amish mother tell her the truth. Now we find ourselves at the beginning of that journey for Katie to find her mother, Laura Mayfield-Bennett (Sherry Stringfield, TV's ""ER""), a socialite now living in New York. She learns from her doctors that she has only weeks left to live before she succumbs to cancer and her only wish in life is to find Katie.Her husband, Dylan Bennett, is struggling with addiction to alcohol and gambling and she feels if he doesn't get help there won't be anything left of her estate and the foundation she's worked so hard to build. When her husband learns he is being cut out of the will, he is desperate  to satisfy his outstanding gambling debt with some ruthless loan sharks. He learns that Katie is searching for her birth mother, Laura Bennett and soon comes up with a plan to appease his gambling debt and get back in his wife's good graces again but hiring a stand in to act as the long lost daughter. Since Laura has never met the real Katie Lapp and is at the end of her life, she is desperate to believe that Katie has come home at last.I received The Confession compliments of Sony Pictures, Affirm Films/Provident Films, and Edify Media for my honest review on this DVD and received no monetary compensation for a favorable review. The only flaw I saw in this movie is that the actress who played Katie Lapp (Danielle Panabaker) in The Shunning is different than in The Confession so if you are watching them back to back, there is a disconnect between the character of Katie Lapp. I prefer the first actress from The Shunning but the story overall is amazing. The depths to which the husband will go to make money off of his dying wife is extraordinary and has you rooting for her to throw him out and discover the truth. It's only when someone from Katie's past shows up that things get interesting in the Bennett household. Now I can't wait for the next movie in the Hickory Hollow series and hope that Katie can truly find happiness in either her English life or her Amish one.This movie was directed by Michael Landon Jr and has a running time of approximately 88 minutes. I had the opportunity to review The Shunning on DVD and think this make a wonderful sequel to the series. If you haven't seen The Shunning, I would suggest watching that one first to understand the back story to Katie's Amish upbringing and why the desire to find her birth mother is so strong. I rate this one a 5 out of 5 stars in my opinion.",5,An amazing sequel that follows right where The Shunning left off!!!,1368835200,"05 18, 2013",2013,3253,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'family', 'friend', 'movies', 'LOVE', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'got', 'perfect', 'review', 'giveaway', 'just', 'Beverly', 'Lewis', 'one', 'best', 'selling', 'authors', 'Amish', 'fiction', 'been', 'blessed', 'enough', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'famous', 'series', 'made', 'movie', 'Shunning', 'now', 'second', 'Heritage', 'Lancaster', 'County', 'Series', 'Confession', 'now', 'ready', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'June', '11th.In', 'latest', 'movie', 'once', 'again', 'follow', 'Katie', 'Lapp', 'Katie', 'Leclerc', 'TV', 'Switched', 'Birth', 'who', 'left', 'off', 'Shunning', 'learning', 'was', 'adopted', 'Amish', 'couple', 'was', 'born', 'English', 'birth', 'mother', 'was', 'searching', 'Katie', 'Amish', 'parents', 'kept', 'apart', 'Only', 'when', 'learning', 'birth', 'mother', 'was', 'dying', 'cancer', 'did', 'Katie', 'Amish', 'mother', 'tell', 'truth', 'Now', 'find', 'beginning', 'journey', 'Katie', 'find', 'mother', 'Laura', 'Mayfield-Bennett', 'Sherry', 'Stringfield', 'TV', 'ER', 'socialite', 'now', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'doctors', 'only', 'weeks', 'left', 'live', 'cancer', 'only', 'wish', 'life', 'find', 'Katie.Her', 'husband', 'Dylan', 'Bennett', 'struggling', 'addiction', 'alcohol', 'gambling', ""n't"", 'get', 'help', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'anything', 'left', 'estate', 'foundation', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'build', 'When', 'husband', 'being', 'cut', 'will', 'desperate', 'satisfy', 'outstanding', 'gambling', 'debt', 'ruthless', 'loan', 'sharks', 'Katie', 'searching', 'birth', 'mother', 'Laura', 'Bennett', 'soon', 'up', 'plan', 'appease', 'gambling', 'debt', 'get', 'back', 'wife', 'good', 'graces', 'again', 'hiring', 'stand', 'act', 'long', 'lost', 'daughter', 'Laura', 'never', 'met', 'real', 'Katie', 'Lapp', 'end', 'life', 'desperate', 'believe', 'Katie', 'come', 'home', 'last.I', 'received', 'Confession', 'compliments', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'Affirm', 'Films/Provident', 'Films', 'Edify', 'Media', 'honest', 'review', 'DVD', 'received', 'monetary', 'compensation', 'favorable', 'review', 'only', 'flaw', 'saw', 'movie', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Katie', 'Lapp', 'Danielle', 'Panabaker', 'Shunning', 'different', 'Confession', 'are', 'watching', 'back', 'back', 'disconnect', 'character', 'Katie', 'Lapp', 'prefer', 'first', 'actress', 'Shunning', 'story', 'overall', 'amazing', 'depths', 'husband', 'will', 'go', 'make', 'money', 'dying', 'wife', 'extraordinary', 'rooting', 'throw', 'out', 'discover', 'truth', 'only', 'when', 'someone', 'Katie', 'past', 'up', 'things', 'get', 'interesting', 'Bennett', 'household', 'Now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'movie', 'Hickory', 'Hollow', 'series', 'hope', 'Katie', 'can', 'truly', 'find', 'happiness', 'English', 'life', 'Amish', 'one.This', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'Jr', 'running', 'time', 'approximately', '88', 'minutes', 'had', 'opportunity', 'review', 'Shunning', 'DVD', 'think', 'make', 'wonderful', 'sequel', 'series', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Shunning', 'would', 'suggest', 'watching', 'one', 'first', 'understand', 'back', 'story', 'Katie', 'Amish', 'upbringing', 'why', 'desire', 'find', 'birth', 'mother', 'so', 'strong', 'rate', 'one', '5', '5', 'stars', 'opinion']",Beverly Lewis' the Confession

I was quite intrigued by how this second movie in the series kept my interest and how it turned out.The actors did a wonderful job and the settings were marvelous. I loved the mansion Laura lived in and the sounding grounds.I like how Katie was pushed into being a servant in her mother's house and how she was sweet and loving about it.This is a wholesome family movie that will be fantastic for a family night. It teaches many lessons and like the DVD covers says The Confession is ""A touching story of deceit, trust and love.""I would highly recommend this DVD to everyone. If you love Amish stories and good movies this one is for you. I love the way it ended, but I know a third one will be coming out and I look forward to that.""Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.
