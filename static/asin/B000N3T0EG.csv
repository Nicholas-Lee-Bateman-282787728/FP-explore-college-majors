Delroy Lindo was excellent as the chief FBI officer.  The two worked together on screen beautifully--and believably.  The plot and sub-plots were tight and not distracting to the main flow of events.  I read that one reason this show wasn't renewed is because if you missed an episode, yuou were lost with the next episode.  I don't think this was true--look at 24 for instance.

1053163,A3E6ZGTIZHDA0L,B000N3T0EG,"Chris Youngblood ""Christopher Youngblood""","[5, 6]","So we have Kidnapped. The show premiered on NBC and was canceled after only 5 episodes. This is why I do not get into network TV folks! You get into a show and ""BAM!"" it's gone without a rhyme or reason.Lets look at the outline of this show. The show was pitched to the network (NBC) as a season long whodunit. Every season was going to feature a new kidnapping and the core stars of the show would return season to season. A fairly risky move as the viewer MUST watch from the beginning to fully understand whats going on. However the concept has worked on shows like 24. So NBC took the plunge and ordered an entire season.However from the ratings of the pilot episode the network knew the show was in trouble and spoke with the producers of the show and asked if they could wrap the entire season in a shorter time span. As more episodes premiered the ratings grew worse and the network moved the show a few times finally putting the show on the worst time lot their is...Saturday Night @ 10:00 PM. After the 5th episode aired the show was officially canceled. However NBC did agree to post the remaining episodes on their website one a week until the the show was completed. Not many people took advantage of this. The remaining shows did air split up over the next year in the middle of the night which makes no sense.But lets look at the positive situation of this. The show was completed and every question was answered. A rare gift of canceled shows like this. If you have ever watched the show ""Reunion"" you will know what I mean because ""Kidnapped"" answers the question of whodunit.The show was a roller coaster from the beginning episode and seemed a bit rushed getting into the middle of the series. This was because the writers had the season written to be 22 episodes long and had to shorten it down to 13 episodes. Similar to ""Jericho Season 2"" being reduced from 22 episodes down to only 7. The core cast was good with Jeremy Sisto, Delroy Lindo, and rounded out by the gorgeous Carmen Ejogo who played Knapp's (Sisto) assistant. The season stars were Timothy Hutton, Dana Delany, Will Denton, and Mykelti Williamson. The season stars were not as likable as the core stars and Williamson overacted abit although I am a fan of his.Funny scene when Knapp (Sisto) is talking with an FBI agent in Times Square in front of the ""Bubba - Gump Shrimp Company"". I found that amusing because Mykelti Williamson was ""Bubba"" in the movie ""Forrest Gump"".All in all a good show and a real treat to fans who may have only caught the first few episodes. The series does indeed end with finality and the I will admit did not see the person behind it all coming until the end of the show. What was so neat about it was the whole scheme was a maze built on a maze inside a maze as said by one of the villains. The bad guys had no idea who they were working for as the handlers had handlers.Semi unique concept of a show and it's a shame that it didn't take off. However we are blessed with the entire series being released on DVD because we do get our questions answered. I do recommend this feature even though there are a few minor flaws.",4,A solid show...cancelled with closure?,1237507200,"03 20, 2009",2009,3137,"['have', 'Kidnapped', 'show', 'premiered', 'NBC', 'was', 'canceled', 'only', '5', 'episodes', 'why', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'network', 'TV', 'folks', 'get', 'show', 'BAM', 'gone', 'rhyme', 'reason.Lets', 'look', 'outline', 'show', 'show', 'was', 'pitched', 'network', 'NBC', 'season', 'long', 'whodunit', 'Every', 'season', 'was', 'going', 'feature', 'new', 'kidnapping', 'core', 'stars', 'show', 'would', 'return', 'season', 'season', 'fairly', 'risky', 'move', 'viewer', 'MUST', 'watch', 'beginning', 'fully', 'understand', 'whats', 'going', 'However', 'concept', 'worked', 'shows', '24', 'So', 'NBC', 'took', 'plunge', 'ordered', 'entire', 'season.However', 'ratings', 'pilot', 'episode', 'network', 'knew', 'show', 'was', 'trouble', 'spoke', 'producers', 'show', 'asked', 'could', 'wrap', 'entire', 'season', 'shorter', 'time', 'span', 'more', 'episodes', 'premiered', 'ratings', 'grew', 'worse', 'network', 'moved', 'show', 'few', 'times', 'finally', 'putting', 'show', 'worst', 'time', 'lot', 'Saturday', 'Night', '10:00', 'PM', '5th', 'episode', 'aired', 'show', 'was', 'officially', 'canceled', 'However', 'NBC', 'did', 'agree', 'post', 'remaining', 'episodes', 'website', 'one', 'week', 'show', 'was', 'completed', 'Not', 'many', 'people', 'took', 'advantage', 'remaining', 'shows', 'did', 'air', 'split', 'up', 'next', 'year', 'middle', 'night', 'sense.But', 'look', 'positive', 'situation', 'show', 'was', 'completed', 'question', 'was', 'answered', 'rare', 'gift', 'canceled', 'shows', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'show', 'Reunion', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'Kidnapped', 'question', 'whodunit.The', 'show', 'was', 'roller', 'coaster', 'beginning', 'episode', 'seemed', 'bit', 'rushed', 'getting', 'middle', 'series', 'was', 'writers', 'had', 'season', 'written', 'be', '22', 'episodes', 'long', 'had', 'shorten', 'down', '13', 'episodes', 'Similar', 'Jericho', 'Season', '2', 'being', 'reduced', '22', 'episodes', 'down', 'only', '7', 'core', 'cast', 'was', 'good', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'Delroy', 'Lindo', 'rounded', 'out', 'gorgeous', 'Carmen', 'Ejogo', 'who', 'played', 'Knapp', 'Sisto', 'assistant', 'season', 'stars', 'were', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'Dana', 'Delany', 'Will', 'Denton', 'Mykelti', 'Williamson', 'season', 'stars', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'likable', 'core', 'stars', 'Williamson', 'overacted', 'am', 'fan', 'his.Funny', 'scene', 'when', 'Knapp', 'Sisto', 'talking', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Times', 'Square', 'front', 'Bubba', 'Gump', 'Shrimp', 'Company', 'found', 'amusing', 'Mykelti', 'Williamson', 'was', 'Bubba', 'movie', 'Forrest', 'Gump', '.All', 'good', 'show', 'real', 'treat', 'fans', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'only', 'caught', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'series', 'indeed', 'end', 'finality', 'will', 'admit', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'person', 'coming', 'end', 'show', 'What', 'was', 'so', 'neat', 'was', 'whole', 'scheme', 'was', 'maze', 'built', 'maze', 'maze', 'said', 'one', 'villains', 'bad', 'guys', 'had', 'idea', 'who', 'were', 'working', 'handlers', 'had', 'handlers.Semi', 'unique', 'concept', 'show', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'off', 'However', 'are', 'blessed', 'entire', 'series', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'do', 'get', 'questions', 'answered', 'do', 'recommend', 'feature', 'even', 'are', 'few', 'minor', 'flaws']",Kidnapped - The Complete Series

I thought it'd be too ""gimmicky"" and felt that I'd ""catch it on the rebound"".  Unfortunately NBC cancelled the series so I was really happy to get my hands on this DVD set.From the menu with the attention grabbing phone call & distorted voice stating ""WE HAVE YOUR SON"", I was hooked.  This series is everything that network tv should strive for - a compelling story, great cast, great script & suspense.  I began to figure out who was behind the plot near the end of the 12th episode and found myself crying during the 13th, that's how good it was.The lead actors are all terrific starting with the cool as Shaft performance by Delroy Lindo as the retiring FBI agent, Mykelti Williamson as the dedicated bodyguard, Carmen Ejogo as the smart as a whip partner to the locator (I loved the scene where she flips the female assassin who dismissed her as a ""computer nerd""), Jeremy Sisto, the troubled locator and finally Dana Delany & Timothy Hutton as the agonized parents.I was engrossed in this show and stayed up late a few nights to finish it and although the current price is a little high for only 13 episodes, it'll be money well spent if you missed this show during its network tv run.**I would add the same word of caution that others have commented on regarding the placement of the ""extra"" feature on disc 2.

I saw portions of it in tv reruns but was lost as to what was going on and the tv rerun was not being run at the same time slot every day/week nor was the episode number advertised.  However, what I saw on tv peaked my interest in the film, so I ordered a copy from Amazon.  I was not disappointed --- just like a good book that you can't put down --- this was a series that I could not stop watching and I completed watching it over a two day period.

1053176,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000N3T0EG,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 8]","NBC set up ""Kidnapped"" for success last summer, making the pilot for both the show and ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"" available on a special DVD through Netflix last summer (the pilot was also available on line).  But when the show premiered it had only 7.5 million viewers for week one and then down to 6.3 million for week two.  With a continuing storyline the networks know that if your ratings go down they are never going to go up, so NBC announced the series would only run 13 episodes instead of the usual 22 and be moved to the graveyard that is Saturday night network television.  This move lasted for two more episodes and then NBC yanked the show from their schedule, posting the other eight episodes online.  Ironically, while I was watching the complete series on DVD I discovered that NBC was actually airing the unseen episodes in the wee hours of the morning.  But the main thing is that with this show, at least, we get to the end of the story (unlike ""Threshold,"" ""The Nine,"" and a whole bunch of other continuing series that ended shortly after they got us hooked).In the ""Pilot,"" Leopold Cain (Will Denton), the son of rich guy Conrad Cain (Timothy Hutton) and his wife Ellie (Dana Delany), is kidnapped by a group of extremely well organized criminals.  The Cains hire Lucian Knapp (Jeremy Sisto) and his assistant Turner (Carmen Ejogo) to bring their son back alive, but it is not long before the FBI becomes involved.  Running the case is by-the-book Agent Andy Archer (Linus Roach), but due deference is paid to Agent Latimer King (Delroy Lindo), who was going to retire but is not going to walk away from this case.  Besides, Latimer and Knapp clearly have a history that comes into play.  But really matters here is that whoever organized this kidnapping really knows what they are doing, providing multiple layers of insulation and a nasty habit of bumping off underlings once they have done their jobs.  In short, this is no ordinary kidnapping but a contender for the best planned one in history.We watched the five episodes that aired in prime time so for us watching the first of the three discs in this set was a recap to get us up to speed for the rest of the series.  At that point I convinced that there was something significant about the fact that Leo's bodyguard, Virgil Hayes (Mykelti Williamson), had survived the kidnapping, and turns out to be the case but not in the way I expected (""Gone Fishin'"").  A strength of this series are the twists, where they set up expectations (e.g., regarding Leopold's ability to hold his breath under water), but consistently take things in a different (and better) direction.  Time and time again when you think you know what is going on, this series proves you wrong, and that becomes a big part of the fun.Obviously one of the most impressive elements of the show is the casting.  Getting Dana Delaney is enough to get me to check out a show, but when you can get Timothy Hutton and Mykelti Williamson to show up for the season, that is pretty impressive.  It is not really until the final episode (""Resolution"") that we understand why Sisto, Ejogo and Lindo get their names up top separate from the rest and how the show would have continued into the future that is never going to happen.  Another thing I liked a lot about the show is that Knapp and King have different approaches to working the case but are willing to work together (""Burn, Baby, Burn"").  The standard approach is to have the FBI give the free-lancer grief, but the show follows the Spenser for Hire approach where the ex-FBI guy is seen as being a help rather than a hindrance.When watching the complete series you will find yourself wondering if the show would have been as great if it had been stretched out to 22 episodes instead of 13.  You can tell that some of the subplots, such as the ones with FBI Agent Vance (""Do Unto Others"") and Aubrey Cain (""Special Delivery""), were cut off before they got to their payoffs or simply abandoned.  The whole idea of the media covering the kidnapping (""Front Page""), which would have become a staple of the Nancy Graces of the world, is completely jettisoned: you see some stories on the news, but the Cains have no problem walking out of their apartment building any time they want.  Plus, I find it hard to believe Benjamin Rand (""My Heart Belongs to Daddy"") would only stick his finger in the pie once.  However, for the most part these changes do not matter because it keeps the focus on finding Leopold and after what happened last season you have to wonder if less would have meant more for ""24"" as well, because ""Kidnapped"" is a lot more impressive than last's years bad day for Jack Bauer.This is not to saw that ""Kidnapped"" is without flaws: The villain should know better than to use a fake name that would be a clue and since one of the heroes is smart enough to keep all of his weapons at a secure location then the villain should find a better place for their incriminating evidence than the basement of their home.  But that could be what happens when the writers have to fast forward to the end.  Besides, you have to admire the way the series ends, with a nice little coda that makes you wish this was not the end of the road and a parting shot at NBC that is as good as a wink that these people knew they were doing pretty solid here.",5,"Yes, the rest of ""Kidnapped"" turned out to be as good as we thought",1187308800,"08 17, 2007",2007,5347,"['NBC', 'set', 'up', 'Kidnapped', 'success',

1053184,A3OJERVDCVKUGL,B000N3T0EG,"M Marsh ""Mermarsh""","[0, 0]","I'll add my DELIGHTED review of this wonderful mini-series simply to consolidate the five-star rating and to reassure anyone who is hesitating over whether to buy the complete set of disks. I had never even heard of Kidnapped; it completely eluded me when it was originally televised. As it is, I hesitated over whether to buy the disks, then put one in my Netflix cue (apologies, Amazon). But from the first episode my husband and I were so addicted and so certain that we would watch it again that I promptly bought the entire series AND paid the additional shipping to ensure instant gratification! I agree both with the reviewers who decry the short-sighted idiocy of the network for canceling a show this good, while also agreeing with the slightly more forgiving reviewers who say that a problem with showing this on network TV would have been that if a viewer missed the first episode, he or she would have felt lost trying to catch up later. IF ANYONE ON A GOOD CABLE NETWORK LIKE HBO READS THESE REVIEWS THEN I AGREE WITH THE MYRIAD FOLKS WHO BELIEVE THAT THIS SHOW WOULD BE A HUGE HIT THERE. Any cable network which both repeats episodes and has an ""on demand"" function that allows viewers to catch up would be the natural home for a series like Kidnapped. Even now it could easily be picked up again since the main actors would likely be available. However, for now, treating this as a mini-series, complete in itself, then I must say that it is a faultless mystery-thriller. The need to cut down from the projected 22 episodes to a mere 13 did not actually mar the production, although I'm sure it changed it. There are a few dangling scenes which hint of stories that never had a chance to unfurl, and, given the marvelous acting and even better writing, they would probably have been great fun to watch. But the severe editing serves to make the series more like a VERY taut and concise feature film.

I was so excited when I first saw there was going to be a new show with him in it. And not only him, Timothy Hutton, Dana Delany and a few other familiar faces I noticed. Unfortunately, it was aired on a bad day of the week. After I bought the whole season and watched each episode, one after the other, it was extremely better than waiting a week. I think they should have made Kidnapped into a mini-series. It would have went quickly and I think more people would have been interested in it. That's just my opinion. I won't give anything away for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but the way it ended, it could definitely have gone on to a second season starring only Jeremy Sisto, or depending on the storyline, the same actors/actresses could have been in it.

1053197,A2NVQZ4Y7Y0J1R,B000N3T0EG,Traveler,"[74, 77]","Kidnapped is ""Without A Trace"" crossed with ""24"" with, IMO, better actors.  Jeremy Sisto, Delroy Lindo (movie star caliber), Timothy Hutton (ditto), Mykelti Williamson (ditto again), and Dana Delaney (probably most famous for ""China Beach"") lead the cast.If you like drama, if you like shows that don't wrap everything up in one episode, you will like ""Kidnapped.""  The production values are high and the story grabs you in the very first episode.  It's almost like a 10 hour movie thriller.I do have to mention a few minor negatives.  For one, the telling of the story (the plot and excellent actors) is better than the resolution.  You'll know ""who did it"" by the second to last episode (if not possibly sooner) which takes some air out of the tires for the final hour or so.  Secondly, the resolution is done adequately, but not with a slam dunk like they had in the very first episode with the kidnapping.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that they knew at time of filming the final episode that the show was going to be canceled and they just needed to get the thing in the can and move on.  But these are minor quibbles.  If you the enjoy the ride more than the destination it makes the show worth your time.So with such a great cast and story, we have to wonder why it was canceled.""Kidnapped"" came out after the unexpected success of ""Lost"" and ""24."" When ABC showed that you could create and keep a solid audience base with a story that took multiple episodes if not multiple seasons to resolve everyone tried to copy the format.  There were probably at least ten such shows.  Some of them just weren't that good in my opinion.  Most of them certainly did not have the high tension and stellar cast of ""Kidnapped.""I've complained about Fox canceling such programs as ""Wonderfalls,"" ""Firefly,"" and ""Kitchen Confidential"" because they were the type of show that didn't require a viewer to catch every episode to become a fan.  If Fox had just had some patience those shows would have caught on and probably stayed on the air for several years.But ""Kidnapped"" was different.  You had to catch the very first episode to get hooked.  People knew in advance that the show was going to require an investment of their time so many just didn't even bother watching.  I know I didn't when it aired.  I saw a few ads, but it didn't catch my attention enough for me to bother.  Some of that is NBC's fault.This is essentially a high tension mini-series drama, not a typical program like ""Without a Trace"" or ""Cold Case.""  It needed to be marketed as such.  NBC needed to put more effort in hyping the show and they really didn't.  This was a show that needed that effort because it didn't have the fantasy/sci-fi hook that great shows like ""Lost"" and ""Battlestar Galactica"" have that set them so far apart from other programs.  A kidnapped child, rich parents, a rogue private eye who uses illegal tactics, and the FBI . . . doesn't sound that interesting does it?  Sounds cliche.  But it worked on the screen because of the great actors, the plot was dense, and there was a real mystery behind who was behind the crime.With that said, it wasn't all NBC's fault.  This show was, for the most part, too good for network TV.  It's called the lowest common denominator.  That's why shows like ""According to Jim"" get created and stay on for years.",5,A case study in why network TV stinks at creating & maintaining great shows,1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,3340,"['Kidnapped', 'Trace', 'crossed', '24', 'IMO', 'better', 'actors', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'Delroy', 'Lindo', 'movie', 'star', 'caliber', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'ditto', 'Mykelti', 'Williamson', 'ditto', 'again', 'Dana', 'Delaney', 'probably', 'most', 'famous', 'China', 'Beach', 'lead', 'cast.If', 'drama', 'like', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'wrap', 'everything', 'up', 'one', 'episode', 'will', 'like', 'Kidnapped', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'high', 'story', 'grabs', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'almost', '10', 'hour', 'movie', 'thriller.I', 'do', 'have', 'mention', 'few', 'minor', 'negatives', 'one', 'telling', 'story', 'plot', 'excellent', 'actors', 'better', 'resolution', ""'ll"", 'know', 'who', 'did', 'second', 'last', 'episode', 'not', 'possibly', 'sooner', 'air', 'tires', 'final', 'hour', 'so', 'Secondly', 'resolution', 'done', 'adequately', 'not', 'slam', 'dunk', 'had', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'kidnapping', 'Perhaps', 'due', 'fact', 'knew', 'time', 'filming', 'final', 'episode', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'canceled', 'just', 'needed', 'get', 'thing', 'can', 'move', 'are', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'more', 'destination', 'show', 'time.So', 'such', 'great', 'cast', 'story', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'canceled', 'Kidnapped', 'came', 'out', 'unexpected', 'success', 'Lost', '24', 'When', 'ABC', 'showed', 'could', 'create', 'keep', 'solid', 'audience', 'base', 'story', 'took', 'multiple', 'episodes', 'not', 'multiple', 'seasons', 'resolve', 'everyone', 'tried', 'copy', 'format', 'were', 'probably', 'least', 'ten', 'such', 'shows', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'opinion', 'Most', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'high', 'tension', 'stellar', 'cast', 'Kidnapped', ""'ve"", 'complained', 'Fox', 'canceling', 'such', 'programs', 'Wonderfalls', 'Firefly', 'Kitchen', 'Confidential', 'were', 'type', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'require', 'viewer', 'catch', 'episode', 'become', 'fan', 'Fox', 'had', 'just', 'had', 'patience', 'shows', 'would', 'have', 'caught', 'probably', 'stayed', 'air', 'several', 'years.But', 'Kidnapped', 'was', 'different', 'had', 'catch', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'get', 'hooked', 'People', 'knew', 'advance', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'require', 'investment', 'time', 'so', 'many', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'watching', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'when', 'aired', 'saw', 'few', 'ads', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'attention', 'enough', 'bother', 'NBC', 'fault.This', 'essentially', 'high', 'tension', 'mini-series', 'drama', 'not', 'typical', 'program', 'Trace', 'Cold', 'Case', 'needed', 'be', 'marketed', 'such', 'NBC', 'needed', 'put', 'more', 'effort', 'hyping', 'show', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'show', 'needed', 'effort', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'fantasy/sci-fi', 'hook', 'great', 'shows', 'Lost', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'have', 'set', 'so', 'far', 'apart', 'other', 'programs', 'kidnapped', 'child', 'rich', 'parents', 'rogue', 'private', 'eye', 'who', 'illegal', 'tactics', 'FBI', ""n't"", 'sound', 'interesting', 'cliche', 'worked', 'screen', 'great', 'actors', 'plot', 'was', 'dense', 'there', 'was', 'real', 'mystery', 'who', 'was', 'crime.With', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'NBC', 'fault', 'show', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'too', 'good', 'network', 'TV', 'called', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'why', 'shows', 'According', 'Jim', 'get', 'created', 'stay', 'years']",Kidnapped - The Complete Series
