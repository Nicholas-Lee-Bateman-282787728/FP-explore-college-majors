It's not the most taxing of stories, but has moments of genuine pathos and humour (witness Weller's imitation of an Owl/birdcalls and also highlights the hardship that the early American pioneers and settlers endured.. Farrah plays Pearl a prostitute who is brought in be a 'substitute wife' by Thompsom (as she is dying) for Weller and its interesting to watch as her character undergoes a change from brittle and hard to soft and caring.A must have for Farrah fans and anyone who likes stories over action.",4,Sweet little drama.,1169164800,"01 19, 2007",2007,621,"['Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'sweet', 'little', 'period', 'drama', 'not', 'most', 'taxing', 'stories', 'moments', 'genuine', 'pathos', 'humour', 'witness', 'Weller', 'imitation', 'Owl/birdcalls', 'also', 'hardship', 'early', 'American', 'pioneers', 'settlers', 'endured..', 'Farrah', 'Pearl', 'prostitute', 'who', 'brought', 'be', ""'substitute"", 'wife', 'Thompsom', 'dying', 'Weller', 'interesting', 'watch', 'character', 'change', 'brittle', 'hard', 'soft', 'caring.A', 'must', 'have', 'Farrah', 'fans', 'anyone', 'who', 'stories', 'action']",Substitute Wife VHS

Why is it so expensive?  I have it on VHS and am always afraid that the tape will break or something because I've watched it so many times.  Farah Fawcett is not just a pretty face on a poster for sure. She does a perfect job in this movie. Peter Weller is perfect. I never liked Lea Thompson before but she is wonderful in this.  Now, anybody looking for a shoot em up, bang, bang, blow it up movie will certainly hate this but anybody with any real taste in movies will love it. It's certainly an unusual story but completely believable and a true picture of what life was like on the prairie for ""sod buster"" families. I can't recommend it highly enough.

It's probably closer to reality than most people could imagine given the hard lifestyle of the early pioneers.  The homesteader works hard non-stop trying to carve a life for his wife and family, but his wife knows that she has something wrong inside.  An Army doctor confirms her worst fear - cancer - and she doesn't have long.  Concerned for her family and knowing that her children will soon need a new mother she decides to pick a wife and mother for her small children before she dies.  Not an easy task given the small number of available women on the prairie and not much to offer a new wife in the first place.  Newly widowed women are spoken for before their deceased hubands are fully laid to rest.Her search draws her to town and the soiled dove community where she finds (Welch) plying her trade, worn out and looking for a way out of the oldest profession.She's only got so much time to teach this prostitute all she will need to know to take her place.  Her husband begins to gradually have feelings for the newcomer, but it's up one day and downhill the next.No action in this one, but it's just stark reality on the prairie.  More of a girl flick than a guy movie, but you realize at the end of the movie that people didn't have many choices and everyday was a test of survival.",4,A Different Twist on Pioneer Life,1141344000,"03 3, 2006",2006,1420,"[""'ve"", 'owned', 'movie', 'several', 'years', 'not', 'high', 'budget', 'crowning', 'cinematic', 'achievement', 'hey', 'really', 'liked', 'probably', 'closer', 'reality', 'most', 'people', 'could', 'imagine', 'given', 'hard', 'lifestyle', 'early', 'pioneers', 'homesteader', 'hard', 'non-stop', 'trying', 'carve', 'life', 'wife', 'family', 'wife', 'something', 'wrong', 'inside', 'Army', 'doctor', 'worst', 'fear', 'cancer', ""n't"", 'have', 'long', 'Concerned', 'family', 'knowing', 'children', 'will', 'soon', 'need', 'new', 'mother', 'pick', 'wife', 'mother', 'small', 'children', 'Not', 'easy', 'task', 'given', 'small', 'number', 'available', 'women', 'prairie', 'not', 'much', 'offer', 'new', 'wife', 'first', 'place', 'Newly', 'widowed', 'women', 'are', 'spoken', 'deceased', 'hubands', 'are', 'fully', 'laid', 'rest.Her', 'search', 'town', 'soiled', 'dove', 'community', 'where', 'Welch', 'plying', 'trade', 'worn', 'out', 'looking', 'way', 'oldest', 'profession.She', 'only', 'got', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'teach', 'prostitute', 'will', 'need', 'know', 'take', 'place', 'husband', 'gradually', 'have', 'feelings', 'newcomer', 'up', 'one', 'day', 'downhill', 'next.No', 'action', 'one', 'just', 'stark', 'reality', 'prairie', 'More', 'girl', 'flick', 'guy', 'movie', 'realize', 'end', 'movie', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'choices', 'everyday', 'was', 'test', 'survival']",Substitute Wife VHS

This is one of Farrah Fawcett's best later movies, I saw it on TV a few times in the 90's on the lifetime channel. I had to get a VHS copy since the old dvd is out of print and very pricey. I don't understand why this hasn't been re released on DVD, it's really a shame Farrah has not been remembered and honored as a icon should be. Nevertheless this is a great movie. The story is a very unique mix of drama, romance, and humor, set in the 1800's a farmers wife learns she will soon die of a illness. She sets out to find a wife to help her husband raise their 4 children and work the family farm. Farrah is great as  a sassy tough prostitute who comes to live with the family. The plot has alot of twist and turns, the music and landscapes are beautiful. Well worth watching and enjoyable for any Farrah Fan.

This story line has some interesting twists and turns that include awkward situations seasoned with humor. Excellent acting from Lea Thompson, Peter Weller, and Farrah Fawcett that draws the viewer into the struggle of everyday life of an 19th century prairie homesteader. May make one ponder on the decisions this young woman has to face...I refuse to go on, I may spoil the ending! Well worth watching.
