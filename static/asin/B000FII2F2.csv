990977,A8MVGWI5ZKNQ5,B000FII2F2,Daisy Brambletoes,"[2, 3]","The main thing I came away with from this twofer is that Anthony Warlow is the most versitile actor singing Gilbert & Sullivan today. On one hand, he is superb as ""Pinafore""'s handsome Captain Corcoran, and grotesquely funny as the half-senile judge in ""Trail by Jury"".H.M.S.Pinafore - The setting is slightly ""updated"" to make the Pinafore appear a contemporary of the Titanic. It is well sung, and on the whole well done, and perhaps I am being picky, but I have seen better.  Admittedly, it is not easy to find a middle ground between romantic comedy, social satire, and a contrived, uncomfortable ending that for me has always been more worthy of Monty Python than Gilbert & Sullivan.  Balancing these elements is never comfortable, and this is yet another well-staged version that doesn't quite do it.Trial by Jury - on the other hand, I wildly applaud this droll and unique production that has had it coming for years.  After all, why would half of London concern themselves over an engagement breakup if it were not involving high-profile personalities referred to only by their first names?  In this version, Edwin and Angelina are obviously socialites and celebrities, instantly recognizable to all, especially a Paris Hilton-like Angelina (even though we are told that Edwin is the one with all the money).  In this modern setting, the little quaint Victorian comedy comes wonderfully to life in ways that we can all recognize and laugh at.  In many ways, ""Trail by Jury"" is the most timely G&S; of all, and in this version, looks as if it popped right off the pages of London tabloids - or from the screen of a BBC comedy.

990978,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B000FII2F2,David Bower,"[89, 92]","When I saw that a DVD with ""Trial By Jury"" was coming out, that was all I needed to buy it. My last recording of it had been an ancient LP. With the advent of home theater, I was determined to wait for a DVD version of it that would provide the visual to go with the audible, as well as provide the connecting narrative parts as well at least in the case of H.M.S. Pinafore.What I've gotten with this DVD is a wondrous delight. The live performances of both of these works was made before a gigantic crowd, which was there to enjoy Gilbert and Sullivan. Well, it's quite evident that the audience enjoyed both performances fully, and I can testify that this viewer was also well pleased.Both performances are just fun! The cast has fun, the audience has fun and I believe that viewers of this DVD will have just as much fun.By and large, the singers look convincing in their rolls. Their voices and their appearances complement each other, and contribute to the effectiveness of the whole.As I mentioned, I purchased this DVD because it had ""Trial By Jury"". I really didn't want another copy of ""H.M.S. Pinafore"". I'm happy to report that this new version of Pinafore will probably become my favorite. It is well done in all regards.I can recommend the addition of this DVD to the collection of anyone who loves the works of Gilbert and Sullivan; especially if you have also been looking for a DVD of ""Trial By Jury"".",5,"Finally, A Trial By Jury on DVD",1152489600,"07 10, 2006",2006,1417,"['When', 'saw', 'DVD', 'Trial', 'Jury', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'was', 'needed', 'buy', 'last', 'recording', 'had', 'been', 'ancient', 'LP', 'advent', 'home', 'theater', 'was', 'determined', 'wait', 'DVD', 'version', 'would', 'provide', 'visual', 'go', 'audible', 'as', 'well', 'provide', 'connecting', 'narrative', 'parts', 'as', 'well', 'least', 'case', 'H.M.S', 'Pinafore.What', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'DVD', 'wondrous', 'delight', 'live', 'performances', 'works', 'was', 'made', 'gigantic', 'crowd', 'was', 'enjoy', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', 'Well', 'quite', 'evident', 'audience', 'enjoyed', 'performances', 'fully', 'can', 'testify', 'viewer', 'was', 'also', 'well', 'pleased.Both', 'performances', 'are', 'just', 'fun', 'cast', 'fun', 'audience', 'fun', 'believe', 'viewers', 'DVD', 'will', 'have', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'fun.By', 'large', 'singers', 'look', 'convincing', 'rolls', 'voices', 'appearances', 'complement', 'other', 'contribute', 'effectiveness', 'whole.As', 'mentioned', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'had', 'Trial', 'Jury', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'copy', 'H.M.S', 'Pinafore', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'new', 'version', 'Pinafore', 'will', 'probably', 'become', 'favorite', 'well', 'done', 'regards.I', 'can', 'recommend', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection', 'anyone', 'who', 'works', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', 'especially', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'looking', 'DVD', 'Trial', 'Jury']",N/A
990979,A29VKODW4R5U7W,B000FII2F2,dooby,"[53, 55]","I agree with all the laudatory reviews here. This is a delightful production of Gilbert & Sullivan's favourite double-bill, H.M.S. Pinafore & Trial By Jury. It comes from Opera Australia and was recorded live over 3 nights in May 2005 at the Arts Centre in Melbourne, Victoria. The soloists are universally outstanding and they are superbly backed by the Melbourne Chorus and Orchestra Victoria. The production received almost unaninmous praise and here one can see why. The performances are scintillating and are guaranteed to bring a smile to the face, have you tapping and swaying to the music and eventually singing along.Both productions have been updated. In the case of HMS Pinafore from the Victorian to Edwardian era. However, the original lyrics are scrupulously adhered to and in ""Monarch of the Sea,"" Sir Joseph Porter (John Bolton-Wood) and the cast in all their Edwardian finery, still refer to his being the ""Ruler of the Queen's Navee."" The updates are never obtrusive and are always pleasing to the eye. The costumes are beautiful and the sets are handsome. Trial by Jury has been similarly updated but to the present day. The English crown court looks regal with its wood-panelled chambers, robed judges and bewigged lawyers.My only reservation, like the previous reviewer, was the choice of Collette Mann as Little Buttercup. She's a fine comedienne but her choice of singing style is curious to say the least. Little Buttercup's song was always one of my favourites in Pinafore and I'm used to hearing it sung in a beautiful lilting voice. Ms Mann's deliberately coarse raspy delivery, doubtless to emphasise the lowly status of her character, was not what I was expecting of this sweet ballad. But that's a small point set against the general excellence of this production.Kultur Video has a spotty reputation with foreign recordings. But this time they have done creditably well. Granted there are no extras, not even such basic things as subtitles. But at least they gave us a disc with excellent picture quality. The DVD is in 1.78:1 widescreen (anamorphic) with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, although there is not much use of the lower frequencies. The Region 2 ""Opus Arte"" release comes with optional English subtitles but has only Dolby 2.0 Stereo and is more expensive. The original Australian, Region 4 edition comes with DD 5.1 but is also without subtitles. Both the R2 and R4 discs are in PAL format, good or bad depending on whether you have a PAL compatible player and display - The video was originally shot on PAL so PAL discs would have no problems with format conversion (PAL to NTSC) and also PAL has the advantage of higher picture resolution (576 vs 480). The Aussie version is available from the official ABCshop website (Australian Broadcasting Corp) but it'll cost more with the additional postage. So you make the choice. The Kultur version with its excellent picture quality is fine enough for me.",5,Splendid modern production of HMS Pinfore and Trial By Jury...

From a remark by an earlier Amazon reviewer, I gather that the DVD version offered was assembled from portions of three separate performances.  I have yet to spot any obvious joins.SOUND:Barely adequate stereo.  The soloists are plainly wearing microphones on headsets throughout the performance.  Their voices register very clearly, in fact, too clearly where Colette Mann is concerned.  By comparison, the chorus registers poorly in many places.  In ""Trial by Jury,"" the women's chorus is particularly hard to pick out, almost disappearing from time to time.  The wonderfully concerted  ""A Nice Dilemma"" becomes, in effect, an ensemble of soloists.  The orchestra comes through acceptably, but without any particular brilliance.CASTS:HMS PINAFOREThe Rt.

Jerky, skittish, full of unnecessary motion and subject to annoying cuts to the orchestra and reverse shots of the audience from the stage.CONDUCTOR:Andrew Greene with the Orchestra Victoria and Melbourne Chorus.SETS:HMS PINAFOREInitially a locker room within the ship which transforms into the stern of the ship for Buttercup's entrance.  After that it becomes a deck of the ship with multiple performing levels on the superstructure.  HMS Pinafore is now a pre-Dreadnaught battleship of the type which became wholly obsolete just before World War I.TRIAL BY JURYVery traditional appearing, wood-paneled, English court room.  Jury box on stage left.  Spectators on right. A sort of cage from which the Defendant testifies at center, just in front of the judge's bench.COSTUMES:HMS PINAFOREThe Captain, Josephine, Sir Joseph, Hebe and the women's chorus are in the fashion of 1911-1912.  The other ranks sailors are left back in the 1870s and look rather anachronistic.TRIAL BY JURYContemporary business attire.COMMENTARY:This DVD pairing of ""HMS Pinafore, or The Lass that Loved a Sailor,"" with the much shorter ""Trial by Jury"" has much to recommend it, as well as some truly annoying missteps.The best thing, by far, is the presence of Anthony Warlow as Captain Corcoran of the Pinafore and later as the Learned Judge in ""Trial.""  In the Australian musical theater, when it comes to Broadway musicals, ""Les Miserables"" or the current ""Phantom of the Opera,"" Warlow is the go-to guy.  As Captain Corcoran he displays a fine, light baritone voice supported by a technique so sound that for all appearances he can ignore it while he concentrates on providing a performance.  In ""Trial,"" on the other hand, he looks and sounds three decades older, singing with an old man's quavering voice, filtering everything through a very respectable Scottish accent.  Why he felt it necessary to go through all that bother, I can't say, but having decided to do so, he does it extremely well.  Not only can the man act and sing, he also moves with the sure-footed physicality of a Gene Kelly or Cary Grant.The worst thing, by far, is the presence of Colette Mann as Little Buttercup.  She does not appear in ""Trial,"" a happy deliverance for which we can gratefully thank a benevolent providence.  I might say that she is unattractive, unpleasant, untalented, off-putting and distasteful--but she isn't really that good.  She is an something between and anchor and an albatross weighing down the production.  To get some idea of her, imagine Cyndi Lauper singing Isolde--except that Mann isn't half as good as Cyndi.The other members of the ""Pinafore"" cast are OK, but they could be better.--John Bolton Wood offers a traditional, not especially memorable version of Sir Joseph.--Richard Alexander misses the character of Dick Deadeye completely, reducing him to a mere naysayer with no special physical attributes except an odd taste in hats.--Andrew Jones, in a small part, has an extraordinarily fine baritone voice but he (or the director) does nothing with the character, leaving him a mere cipher.--Much has been made of David Hobson as Australia's leading tenor.  He sings very nicely.  But there is little or no warmth in the man.  He looks and moves well enough, but he hardly interacts with others, seldom making eye contact, even with Josephine.  The exact opposite of Warlow, he seems more intent on vocal technique than on the meaning of his words.--Tiffany Speight also sings extremely well, but her Josephine is not a degree warmer than Hobson's Ralph.An icy pair of lovers, an unmemorable lead comedian, a pallid villain and an atrocious Buttercup--small wonder that this ""Pinafore"" seems of, for and about Captain Corcoran.  And even that is undermined by the conductor, who treats everything as up-tempo.  His headlong pace simply mangles the Captain's ""Fair Moon, to Thee I Sing""--a real pity, considering the quality of the singer.In ""Trial by Jury,"" the lackluster Wood and Alexander of Pinafore suddenly come to life to look and sound like real stars.  Jones remains as impressively good, but he is still trapped in a tiny part.  Ali McGregor, as the Plaintiff, is an even colder performer than Speight.  Hobson's Defendant is a complete and charmless bounder.  True to form, the conductor takes every single number  too fast, here especially trampling on ""Comes the Broken Flower.""Four stars (which would have dropped to one star if Colette Mann had uttered one more syllable), primarily for the rare appearance of ""Trial by Jury"" on DVD.LEC/AM/09-08",4,Good--but it could and should have been much better,1188604800,"09 1, 2007",2007,6357,"['SOURCE',

This is a video made from a live performance in front of an audience.  That actually added to my enjoyment of the video, but it may not be true for you.I had never seen ""Trial by Jury"" before and didn't realize that the story is just a vehicle for the music, which is excellent.  I wish it had a bit more plot to back up the singing.""HMS Pinafore"" was a joy.  I followed along with the libretto in Ian Bradley's book, ""The Complete Annotated Gilbert & Sullivan"" and discovered some places where the performance didn't match the book and some places where lines had been deleted.  The total may have amounted to a dozen lines, none of them crucial.  I cannot say whether the book is correct or the performance, so I don't consider that a fault.The only real drawback to ""HMS Pinafore"" was the terrible singing performance of Colette Mann, who played Buttercup.  She is a very good actress, but does not have a singing voice.  She's better than Clint Eastwood was in ""Paint Your Wagon"", but that's not saying much.  Her poor singing was overcome by the very good voice of David Hobson (Ralph Rakestraw) and the tremendous voice of Tiffany Speight (Josephine).The camera and audio work was also top notch.  You don't have strain to catch every word, because all the soloists were wearing microphones.  The audio is Dolby 5.1, and the picture is widescreen.I noticed that Opera Australia has made ""Pirates of Penzance"" for TV also.

It is much funnier than I'd anticipated, and all the roles were outstandingly sung and performed. In particular, David Hobson as the Defendant and Anthony Warlow as the Judge were very funny.Pinafore, with the same cast, was also excellent - with one exception. The actress playing Buttercup croaks like a frog. Her voice actually broke in one passage. It's never good when you think to yourself, gee, *I* could sing better than that. Whoever chose to cast her needs their heads examined.The rest of the cast, however, is outstanding. They sing beautifully and act convincingly. I particularly enjoyed Hobson's emphatic high notes in several songs, which seem to be an innovation - other Pinafore recordings I've heard do not have them. His voice is particularly fine in the upper range and he hits the notes with ease.If you can ignore Buttercup, this is a wonderful production.

This is well staged and the costumes are excellent.  Buttercup screeches her way through some of the best parts.  The Sailors are so busy and there is so much business going on that it is distracting.  The real culprit here is the music which has been slowed to a crawl.  The patter songs and general sprightliness is missing so this production comes across more like an operatic wannabe, than a true G&S.;  The music virtually drowns out the singers who suffer from poor ennuciation to begin with.  If you are not familiar with the libretto much of the humor is lost.I had never seen Trial By Jury performed before so this performance was a real challenge since I never could determine precisely what was going on and the Judge came across as silly.  The ennuciation was so poor that I never determined exactly what was going on and who had done what to whom.The other reviewers all found this to be an outstanding performance so perhaps I am being overly critical.  To be fair I did enjoy the performance -- can G&S; ever be totally bad?

990988,A2JYOUDH6U9F9C,B000FII2F2,Squeeky Wheel,"[0, 0]","I got this DVD because my girlfriend is Belgian and had never heard of Gilbert and Sullivan.  I recently got the Guthrie Theatre version of the show and quite enjoyed it, but that version takes great liberties with the score, injecting rock beats beneath the Victorian lyrics.  For this reason, I felt I could not introduce GF to G&S; with a hybrid, however enjoyable it might be, for part of the fun of the hybrid arises from a comparison with the original.The Australian Opera version is much closer to the traditional production, with a full orchestra, and presentation as a series of set pieces, with polite pauses for applause after each, with the cameras turning on the audience to record their enjoying themselves.  It also came with the bonus of my favorite one-act operetta, _Trial by Jury_, that traditionally served as an after piece by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, virtual owners of G&S; for most of the 20th century.  The two pieces are nicely contrasted here, with Pinafore in Victorian costume and Trial in modern dress--I particularly liked the Defendant (the scoundrel) in a suit of lounge-lizard mauve in the short play.It used to be true that opera performers in general were lousy actors; this is happily no longer the case.  I am very impressed with Anthony Warlow, who is Captain Cocoran in Pinafore and the Judge in Trial.  He has a great singing voice of exceptional range and acts so well that I did not recognize him in the second play until the credit roll.  He is a delight in both characters, as is David Hobson (Ralph Rackstraw and the Defendant).  The shows are well sung and well presented.My one disappointment is that this DVD lacks subtitles: my Belgian GF is a native Francophone for whom rapid-fire pattersongs in English would be difficult to follow even if she did not have a hearing problem, and I was rather counting on the written word to help her enjoy the show.",4,An excellent traditional production,1321228800,"11 14, 2011",2011,1908,"['got', 'DVD', 'girlfriend', 'Belgian', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', 'recently', 'got', 'Guthrie', 'Theatre', 'version', 'show', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'version', 'great', 'liberties', 'score', 'injecting', 'rock', 'beats', 'beneath', 'Victorian', 'lyrics', 'reason', 'felt', 'could', 'not', 'introduce', 'GF', 'G', 'S', 'hybrid', 'however', 'enjoyable', 'might', 'be', 'part', 'fun', 'hybrid', 'arises', 'comparison', 'original.The', 'Australian', 'Opera', 'version', 'much', 'closer', 'traditional', 'production', 'full', 'orchestra', 'presentation', 'series', 'set', 'pieces', 'polite', 'pauses', 'applause', 'cameras', 'turning', 'audience', 'record', 'enjoying', 'also', 'came', 'bonus', 'favorite', 'one-act', 'operetta', '_Trial', 'Jury_', 'traditionally', 'served', 'piece', ""D'Oyly"", 'Carte', 'Opera', 'Company', 'virtual', 'owners', 'G', 'S', 'most', '20th', 'century', 'two', 'pieces', 'are', 'nicely', 'contrasted', 'here', 'Pinafore', 'Victorian', 'costume', 'Trial', 'modern', 'dress', 'particularly', 'liked', 'Defendant', 'scoundrel', 'suit', 'lounge-lizard', 'mauve', 'short', 'play.It', 'used', 'be', 'true', 'opera', 'performers', 'general', 'were', 'lousy', 'actors', 'happily', 'no', 'longer', 'case', 'am', 'very', 'impressed', 'Anthony', 'Warlow', 'who', 'Captain', 'Cocoran', 'Pinafore', 'Judge', 'Trial', 'great', 'singing', 'voice', 'exceptional', 'range', 'acts', 'so', 'well', 'did', 'not', 'recognize', 'second', 'play', 'credit', 'roll', 'delight', 'characters', 'David', 'Hobson', 'Ralph', 'Rackstraw', 'Defendant', 'shows', 'are', 'well', 'sung', 'well', 'presented.My', 'one', 'disappointment', 'DVD', 'subtitles', 'Belgian', 'GF', 'native', 'Francophone', 'whom', 'rapid-fire', 'pattersongs', 'English', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'follow', 'even', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'hearing', 'problem', 'was', 'rather', 'counting', 'written', 'word', 'help', 'enjoy', 'show']",N/A

Unlike so many of their DVD competitors, e.g. the Stratford Canadian productions, they aren't mischievously bent, owing to stage director vanity, on distorting the works in question. True, the Gilbert settings have been updated in each of the works here, but the wit of the librettist and the winning music of Sullivan have been maintained, so the mindless changes in time period may be easily overlooked.Both productions, by and large, are distinguished by excellent voices and competent acting. Warlow, Hobson, Speight, and Wood all do even more than justice to their roles. But still there is one drawback that's unnerving, the casting of Little Buttercup, the woman who wonders why in the first place she's called ""Poor"" Little Buttercup. I agree with the judgment of numerous previous reviewers on this point. The poverty of Little Buttercup in this production is no mystery. Collette Mann, unable to sing or act the part, has been mind-bogglingly miscast. What, one has to ask, were the casting directors thinking?
