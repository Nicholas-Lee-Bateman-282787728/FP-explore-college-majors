483009,A2TIWZKG3L06JW,6305909520,"Dean Richards ""reviewer:James Johnston""","[1, 1]","I had the unfortunate experience recently of having known a little girl who was drowned in September of 2010 in a bathtub. It was horrible for everyone who knew this little girl. For her this review is dedicated and for her is the reason I thought to buy this particular 'Zone','Little Girl Lost'.'Little Girl Lost' has always been my very favorite 'Twilight Zone'. Not so much because it's about a lost child, but because it's about other dimensions and about physics.Defying the laws of matter and force, a little girl tumbles out of bed and rolls into a different dimension. She is immediately joined by the family dog who instinctively tracks her whereabouts. her distraught parents can neither see her or feel her but they can hear her and the little dog. Not knowing what to do, they call a neighbor who is a physicist.This is interesting since it was much more common to find people in 1950's America who worked in the field of physics and science than it is today. Studies today report that the number of Americans in that field has been greatly reduced. How sad. obviously people in the 50's were somewhat smarter. We might seem more liberal, but people were smarter and more educated then.What unfolds is a kind of ""little girl in the woods"" fable that depicts some basics of other dimensions and the simple understandings we had back then. I believe this was all before anyone had even concieved of a worm hole. And definitely before anyone discovered black holes.The physicist even makes a map on the wall that looks like chart I have seen by physicist on the Discovery channel on the subject.The whole thing is thought provoking and is what makes the original 'Zone' so good. 'Little Girl Lost' is a true television classic.James (the 'Alice' fan)",5,This Review Is For All Lost Children.

483010,A7Y6AVS576M03,6305909520,gobirds2,"[0, 0]","LITTLE GIRL LOST written by Richard Matheson and directed by Paul Stewart deals realistically with a breach in the time-space continuum found in a little girl's bedroom where in a wall a portal to another dimension has opened. The little girl cries out in desperate echoes for help for she and her dog have gone through the portal where she is now lost and all concepts of time and space as we know them do not exist from our point of view. This is a fascinating story. The parents are aided by a scientist friend (Charles Aidman). The strong cast is comprised of Sarah Marshall, Robert Sampson, and Tracy Stratford. Bernard Herrmann's score written specifically for LITTLE GIRL LOST forgoes the sentimentality and jumps right into the menace capturing the confusion and a curious wonderment of a multi dimensional world that the little girl and her dog are now lost in.A PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS written by George Clayton Johnson and directed by James Sheldon features Dick York as a man who tosses a coin buying a newspaper that lands on edge and he soon finds that one in a million chance has given him the ability to hear other peoples thoughts. Dick York is very good and very memorable in this episode.A NICE PLACE TO VISIT written by Charles Beaumont and directed by John Brahm is from the first season with Larry Blyden, Sebastion Cabot and Sandra Warner. Larry Blyden is over the top as a gangster after being shot and killed finds himself in a world where he gets everything he wants. Sebastion Cabot is his would be mentor and he introduces him to the opulence of his new life with interesting repercussions.I AM THE NIGHT - COLOR ME BLACK written by Rod Serling and directed by Abner Biberman features Michael Constatine, Paul Fix, George Lindsay, Terry Becker, Ivan Dixon in this tale where the sun fails to come up in a town out west where a man is going to be executed for killing a bigot. Paul Fix is very good as the local newspaperman who is convinced that man to be executed is innocent. Ivan Dixon, the black preacher, delivers words in a sermon on this day. The statement on bigotry and racism is quite clear in this episode.",5,LITTLE GIRL LOST,1379808000,"09 22, 2013",2013,2145,"['LITTLE', 'GIRL', 'LOST', 'written', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Stewart', 'realistically', 'breach', 'time-space', 'continuum', 'found', 'little', 'girl', 'bedroom', 'where', 'wall', 'portal', 'dimension', 'opened', 'little', 'girl', 'cries', 'out', 'desperate', 'echoes', 'help', 'dog', 'have', 'gone', 'portal', 'where', 'now', 'lost', 'concepts', 'time', 'space', 'know', 'do', 'not', 'exist', 'point', 'view', 'fascinating', 'story', 'parents', 'are', 'aided', 'scientist', 'friend', 'Charles', 'Aidman', 'strong', 'cast', 'comprised', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'Robert', 'Sampson', 'Tracy', 'Stratford', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'score', 'written', 'specifically', 'LITTLE', 'GIRL', 'LOST', 'sentimentality', 'jumps', 'right', 'menace', 'capturing', 'confusion', 'curious', 'wonderment', 'multi', 'dimensional', 'world', 'little', 'girl', 'dog', 'are', 'now', 'lost', 'in.A', 'PENNY', 'FOR', 'YOUR', 'THOUGHTS', 'written', 'George', 'Clayton', 'Johnson', 'directed', 'James', 'Sheldon', 'Dick', 'York', 'man', 'who', 'coin', 'buying', 'newspaper', 'edge', 'soon', 'one', 'million', 'chance', 'given', 'ability', 'hear', 'other', 'peoples', 'thoughts', 'Dick', 'York', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'memorable', 'episode.A', 'NICE', 'PLACE', 'TO', 'VISIT', 'written', 'Charles', 'Beaumont', 'directed', 'John', 'Brahm', 'first', 'season', 'Larry', 'Blyden', 'Sebastion', 'Cabot', 'Sandra', 'Warner', 'Larry', 'Blyden', 'top', 'gangster', 'being', 'shot', 'killed', 'finds', 'world', 'where', 'everything', 'Sebastion', 'Cabot', 'would', 'be', 'mentor', 'opulence', 'new', 'life', 'interesting', 'repercussions.I', 'AM', 'THE', 'NIGHT', 'COLOR', 'ME', 'BLACK', 'written', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'directed', 'Abner', 'Biberman', 'Michael', 'Constatine', 'Paul', 'Fix', 'George', 'Lindsay', 'Terry', 'Becker', 'Ivan', 'Dixon', 'tale', 'where', 'sun', 'come', 'up', 'town', 'out', 'west', 'where', 'man', 'going', 'be', 'executed', 'killing', 'bigot', 'Paul', 'Fix', 'very', 'good', 'local', 'newspaperman', 'who', 'convinced', 'man', 'be', 'executed', 'innocent', 'Ivan', 'Dixon', 'black', 'preacher', 'delivers', 'words', 'sermon', 'day', 'statement', 'bigotry', 'racism', 'quite', 'clear', 'episode']",N/A
483011,A366S12KCZ280V,6305909520,"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover""","[0, 0]","Volume 29 from the series of DVDs of the &#34;Twilight Zone&#34; feature four more great episodes from the show. All of them are near classics that are popular with the fans with memorable scenes and actors.First up on the disc is &#34;A Nice Place to Visit&#34;. A gangster named Rocky Valentine, played by Larry Blyden, is gunned down by police while he is trying to get away from them during a burglary. When he wakes up he finds he is still laying on the street with a man all in white standing there. The man who's name is Mr. Pip, played by Sebastian Cabot, is there to assist him. Pip takes Rocky to a home they got for him. Inside it is lavishly furnished and whatever Rocky wants Mr. Pip will get for him. Sounds like Heaven but then this IS the Zone.Next up is &#34;A Penny For Your Thoughts&#34;. It stars Dick York, best remembered for his role as Darren on &#34;Bewitched&#34;, as a man while on his way to work stops to buy a newspaper. He flips a quarter into the box and the coin lands on its edge. A million to one chance of that happening as the man selling the papers notes. From there things get strange for the man. All of a sudden he seems to be able to read minds. Every ones minds from the person passing him on the street to his co-workers at the bank. It leads to a very interesting day of work for him to be sure. Certainly a day he won't forget.The next story on the DVD is probably one of the most memorable one. One night the parents of a little girl awaken to the sound of their daughter calling out for them. They hear her but they can't see her. Anywhere. The episode is called  &#34;Little Girl Lost&#34;. Turns out she fell out of bed onto the floor and into a hole that takes her to the fourth dimension. They call a friend who is a physicist who tries to help them before the hole she fell in closes up for good. Interesting note, this episode was written by Charles Beaumont who came up with the idea for the story after one night his own daughter fell out of bed and rolled under it. When she called out for help and he came into her bedroom he of course could not see her at first. While she did not fall into the fourth dimension she did give her father a great story idea.Rounding out this volume is &#34;I Am the Night--Color Me Black&#34;. A man is about to be executed for the murder of the town bigot. Nobody mourns the death of the victim but they do want their justice for the crime committed. As the town gets ready for the upcoming hanging a strange is occurring over the town. It is daytime, the sun should be up but it is pitch black outside. No one can explain it but the plans for the hanging keeps going forward. This is an episode that was written by Rod Serling and it is classic Serling with a story dealing with bigotry and racism and mans need for revenge. This episode is full of great actors too from Michael Constatine as the sheriff to Paul Fix as the towns newspaper editor to Ivan Dixon as the preacher to George Lindsay, yes that George Lindsay of Goober fame, as the deputy. A strong story with an important message.Of all the individual volumes of the &#34;Twilight Zone&#34;, and there are 43 altogether, this is one of the best around. For any fan of TZ or for someone who has never seen the show before this is a great DVD to add to your collection.",5,Four More Classics From The Zone,1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,3321,"['Volume', '29', 'series', 'DVDs', '34', 'Twilight', 'Zone', '34', 'feature', 'four', 'more', 'great', 'episodes', 'show', 'are', 'near', 'classics', 'are', 'popular', 'fans', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'actors.First', 'up', 'disc', '34', 'A', 'Nice', 'Place', 'Visit', '34', 'gangster', 'named', 'Rocky', 'Valentine', 'played', 'Larry', 'Blyden', 'gunned', 'down', 'police', 'trying', 'get', 'away', 'burglary', 'When', 'up', 'still', 'laying', 'street', 'man', 'white', 'standing', 'there', 'man', 'who', 'name', 'Mr.', 'Pip', 'played', 'Sebastian', 'Cabot', 'there', 'assist', 'Pip', 'Rocky', 'home', 'got', 'lavishly', 'furnished', 'Rocky', 'Mr.', 'Pip', 'will', 'get', 'Heaven', 'then', 'Zone.Next', 'up', '34', 'Penny', 'Your', 'Thoughts', '34', 'Dick', 'York', 'best', 'remembered', 'role', 'Darren', '34', 'Bewitched', '34', 'man', 'way', 'work', 'stops', 'buy', 'newspaper', 'quarter', 'box', 'coin', 'edge', 'million', 'one', 'chance', 'happening', 'man', 'selling', 'papers', 'notes', 'things', 'get', 'strange', 'man', 'sudden', 'be', 'able', 'read', 'minds', 'ones', 'minds', 'person', 'passing', 'street', 'co-workers', 'bank', 'very', 'interesting', 'day', 'work', 'be', 'sure', 'Certainly', 'day', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget.The', 'next', 'story', 'DVD', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'one', 'One', 'night', 'parents', 'little', 'girl', 'awaken', 'sound', 'daughter', 'calling', 'out', 'hear', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'Anywhere', 'episode', 'called', '34', 'Little', 'Girl', 'Lost', '34', 'out', 'fell', 'out', 'bed', 'floor', 'hole', 'fourth', 'dimension', 'call', 'friend', 'who', 'physicist', 'who', 'help', 'hole', 'fell', 'closes', 'up', 'good', 'Interesting', 'note', 'episode', 'was', 'written', 'Charles', 'Beaumont', 'who', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'story', 'one', 'night', 'own', 'daughter', 'fell', 'bed', 'rolled', 'When', 'called', 'out', 'help', 'came', 'bedroom', 'course', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'first', 'did', 'not', 'fall', 'fourth', 'dimension', 'did', 'give', 'father', 'great', 'story', 'idea.Rounding', 'out', 'volume', '34', 'Am', 'Night', 'Color', 'Me', 'Black', '34', 'man', 'be', 'executed', 'murder', 'town', 'bigot', 'Nobody', 'death', 'victim', 'do', 'want', 'justice', 'crime', 'committed', 'town', 'ready', 'upcoming', 'hanging', 'strange', 'occurring', 'town', 'daytime', 'sun', 'should', 'be', 'up', 'pitch', 'black', 'outside', 'one', 'can', 'explain', 'plans', 'hanging', 'going', 'forward', 'episode', 'was', 'written', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'classic', 'Serling', 'story', 'dealing', 'bigotry', 'racism', 'mans', 'need', 'revenge', 'episode', 'full', 'great', 'actors', 'too', 'Michael', 'Constatine', 'sheriff', 'Paul', 'Fix', 'towns', 'newspaper', 'editor', 'Ivan', 'Dixon', 'preacher', 'George', 'Lindsay', 'George', 'Lindsay', 'Goober', 'fame', 'deputy', 'strong', 'story', 'important', 'message.Of', 'individual', 'volumes', '34', 'Twilight', 'Zone', '34', 'are', '43', 'altogether', 'one', 'best', 'around', 'fan', 'TZ', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'great', 'DVD', 'add', 'collection']",N/A
