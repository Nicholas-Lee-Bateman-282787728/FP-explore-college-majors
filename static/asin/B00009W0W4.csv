758681,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B00009W0W4,Anyechka,"[4, 5]","This interesting film tells the story of Kurt Gerstein, a real-life SS officer who risked everything to try to get the Vatican to alert the world to the Shoah and to do something, anything, to stop it.  He was a chemist and sanitation engineer who originally was responsible for creating gas to fumigate barracks, blankets, and clothes being used by the Wehrmacht.  Before long he was pressed into service sanitising the drinking water for the soldiers serving in the East, and working for the Institute of Hygiene.  While working on a way to combat typhus in the East, he discovers just what his gas is being used for.  Thoroughly shaken and horrified after personally witnessing people being murdered in a gas chamber, he turns all of his moral energy towards trying to get through to the Vatican, since he knows what a powerful leader the Pope is, even though he himself is a Protestant.  The euthanasia of the mentally disabled (his own niece among them) was stopped when Church leaders protested against it, and Gerstein believes, very optimistically, that the murders of European Jewry too will be halted once such a major leader of the Christian world speaks out against it.  At his first attempted meeting with Vatican officials, he meets Ricardo Fontana (a composite of several real-life priests), a young Jesuit priest whose family has powerful connections to the Vatican.  Both men spend the rest of the war trying to use their positions of power and prestige to stop the genocide, even as everyone around them maintains an unbelievable silence.  It's an important story and powerful message about the dangers of complacency and the power of a few individuals to make a difference.There are the usual suspects who have accused this film of being anti-Catholic, but it's not meant to be a political film.  This is about historical events, and the stunning silence so many Christian leaders maintained in the face of mounting evidence of atrocities, refusing to use their power to speak out and do something the way they had in the past.  And while Italy itself (home to Europe's oldest Jewish community) ""only"" lost about 19% of its prewar Jewish population, and many Italian Jews were hidden with the help of Church officials, the victims the film largely deals with come from Eastern Europe, people who were being deported and murdered long before that fate began to be dealt to Italian Jewry in September 1943.  Real history might unsettle us when it doesn't always depict things such as religious institutions in a positive light, but that doesn't make it propaganda or a lie.While part of the film's effectiveness comes from the fact that it never really shows any of the atrocities that Gerstein and Ricardo are protesting against, that also is a bit of a downside.  While less is more, that ""less"" doesn't have to be just vaguely hinted at or only show in a few very brief scenes.  A lot of the film depicts politicking, and thus it can be hard at times to really feel emotionally drawn into the story when it's almost all dialogue.  At times it seems more like a tv movie than a feature-length film.  However, since it was based on a play (Rolf Hochhuth's 'Der Stellvertreter,' 'The Representative'), the staginess of a lot of it seems more understandable.  I do wish though that there had been some more emotional depth brought to these characters, and that there had been more of a chronology.  Apart from a few things, such as the mention of the defeat at Stalingrad and the winter landscape, there isn't much clear sense of what year it is or how much time passed since the last scene.  And since this is based on a play about historical events, it seemed to lack more of a distinct narrative arc, with a set beginning, middle, and end, and as a result the end did seem a bit anticlimactic to me.  In spite of those issues, though, I did still quite enjoy it.Extras include trailers, a ""making-of"" documentary, comparison of a scene from the film with a scene from the play, bios and filmographies of the director and two protagonists, information on the real Kurt Gerstein, and an interview with director Costa-Gavras.",4,An important story,1193184000,"10 24, 2007",2007,4141,"['interesting', 'film', 'story', 'Kurt', 'Gerstein', 'real-life', 'SS', 'officer', 'who', 'risked', 'everything', 'try', 'get', 'Vatican', 'alert', 'world', 'Shoah', 'do', 'something', 'anything', 'stop', 'was', 'chemist', 'sanitation', 'engineer', 'who', 'originally', 'was', 'responsible', 'creating', 'gas', 'fumigate', 'barracks', 'blankets', 'clothes', 'being', 'used', 'Wehrmacht', 'long', 'was', 'pressed', 'service', 'sanitising', 'drinking', 'water', 'soldiers', 'serving', 'East', 'working', 'Institute', 'Hygiene', 'working', 'way', 'combat', 'typhus', 'East', 'just', 'what', 'gas', 'being', 'used', 'Thoroughly', 'shaken', 'horrified', 'personally', 'witnessing', 'people', 'being', 'murdered', 'gas', 'chamber', 'moral', 'energy', 'towards', 'trying', 'get', 'Vatican', 'what', 'powerful', 'leader', 'Pope', 'even', 'Protestant', 'euthanasia', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'own', 'niece', 'was', 'stopped', 'when', 'Church', 'leaders', 'protested', 'Gerstein', 'very', 'optimistically', 'murders', 'European', 'Jewry', 'too', 'will', 'be', 'halted', 'once', 'such', 'major', 'leader', 'Christian', 'world', 'out', 'first', 'attempted', 'meeting', 'Vatican', 'officials', 'Ricardo', 'Fontana', 'composite', 'several', 'real-life', 'priests', 'young', 'Jesuit', 'priest', 'family', 'powerful', 'connections', 'Vatican', 'men', 'spend', 'rest', 'war', 'trying', 'use', 'positions', 'power', 'prestige', 'stop', 'genocide', 'even', 'everyone', 'unbelievable', 'silence', 'important', 'story', 'powerful', 'message', 'dangers', 'complacency', 'power', 'few', 'individuals', 'make', 'difference.There', 'are', 'usual', 'suspects', 'who', 'have', 'accused', 'film', 'being', 'anti-Catholic', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'political', 'film', 'about', 'historical', 'events', 'stunning', 'silence', 'so', 'many', 'Christian', 'leaders', 'maintained', 'face', 'mounting', 'evidence', 'atrocities', 'refusing', 'use', 'power', 'speak', 'out', 'do', 'something', 'way', 'had', 'past', 'Italy', 'home', 'Europe', 'oldest', 'Jewish', 'community', 'only', 'lost', '19', '%', 'prewar', 'Jewish', 'population', 'many', 'Italian', 'Jews', 'were', 'hidden', 'help', 'Church', 'officials', 'victims', 'film', 'largely', 'come', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'being', 'deported', 'murdered', 'long', 'fate', 'began', 'be', 'dealt', 'Italian', 'Jewry', 'September', '1943', 'Real', 'history', 'might', 'unsettle', 'when', ""n't"", 'always', 'depict', 'things', 'such', 'religious', 'institutions', 'positive', 'light', ""n't"", 'make', 'propaganda', 'lie.While', 'part', 'film', 'effectiveness', 'fact', 'never', 'really', 'atrocities', 'Gerstein', 'Ricardo', 'are', 'protesting', 'also', 'bit', 'downside', 'less', 'more', 'less', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'just', 'vaguely', 'hinted', 'only', 'show', 'few', 'very', 'brief', 'scenes', 'lot', 'film', 'politicking', 'thus', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'times', 'really', 'feel', 'emotionally', 'drawn', 'story', 'when', 'almost', 'dialogue', 'times', 'more', 'tv', 'movie', 'feature-length', 'film', 'However', 'was', 'based', 'play', 'Rolf', 'Hochhuth', ""'Der"", 'Stellvertreter', 'Representative', 'staginess', 'lot', 'more', 'understandable', 'do', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'emotional', 'depth', 'brought', 'characters', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'chronology', 'Apart', 'few', 'things', 'such', 'mention', 'defeat', 'Stalingrad', 'winter', 'landscape', ""n't"", 'much', 'clear', 'sense', 'what', 'year', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'passed', 'last', 'scene', 'based', 'play', 'about', 'historical', 'events', 'seemed', 'lack', 'more', 'distinct', 'narrative', 'arc', 'set', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'result', 'end', 'did', 'seem', 'bit', 'anticlimactic', 'spite', 'issues', 'did', 'still', 'quite', 'enjoy', 'it.Extras', 'include', 'trailers', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'comparison', 'scene', 'film', 'scene', 'play', 'bios', 'filmographies', 'director', 'two', 'protagonists', 'information', 'real', 'Kurt', 'Gerstein', 'interview', 'director', 'Costa-Gavras']",N/A
758682,A27DHFFWMH042Y,B00009W0W4,"Cathleen M. Walker ""geminiwalker""","[11, 15]","This is the story of SS Officer Kurt Gerstein, the ""good Nazi"" who was good at his job and believed in his work until he realized what it was. This is my first experience with the concept of the ""good Nazi,"" especially one that operates in the ranks of the SS - but the story claims to be true. While the Gerstein character is real, the Catholic Priest who tries to help him is a fictional character, a composite of others. Still, I've done a lot of reading on the holocaust, and I have yet to find a Catholic Priest who actually worked the ovens. Please. The Nazis made the Jews do that, and they  made them do it for a reason. Because the Nazis were very, very ""good"" at what they did, and the mental torture made the physical torture exquisite.Gerstein's area of expertise was ""disinfection,"" but he had no idea, apparently, what the ""final solution"" was all about. Most Germans did not, or if they did, were in complete denial about it. Denial is not that hard to believe. We are living in it now.It isn't until Gerstin actually gets to look through the peephole each gas chamber contained that he could see the naked bodies climbing all over each other, the weakest at the bottom, in order to get to what air was left at the top. Apparently, the other Nazis weren't bothered. He was.""I must be the eyes of God in that hell!"" cries the Priest. A great line. I'm sure God had lots of eyes in that hell.With each attempt to work within the system, as many of us continue to do in our own corrupt systems, the protests are familiar:""We are at war!"" (When at war, all bets are off)""Germans are incapable of such attrocities!"" (How often have I heard that bureaucracies couldn't organize a conspiracy to wipe their own noses!)Protestations were dismissed as ""rumors"" and ""conspiracy theories."" (sigh) The more things change...""The Jews left for America long ago.""""There is no proof."" (Just because there is no proof doesn't mean it isn't happening.)The scene of the Germans celebrating Christmas with their fancy dinner and fancy liquor singing ""Silent Night"" when you just know ashes of the dead are falling, mixed with snow is probably the creepiest scene.The Pope never even pronounced the word ""Jew"" or ""Concentration Camp."" Just like so many Presidents who never pronounced the word ""AIDS"".""We refuse to negotiate with the Nazis."" (""We don't negotiate with terrorists)""Jews are being sent to labor camps!"" (Certainly not being tortured and killed!)One line - ""It is out of the question for an SS who is betraying his country to appear at the Vatican!"" What kind of a Catch 22 is that???I refuse to take the hard line that Gerstein was a coward who did nothing. It is easy for armchair quarterbacks who weren't there to presume that it would have been easy to stop the machine that was Fascism. Many people tried. Apparently, Gerstein was one of them. Many Germans tried to work within the system, and console themselves with the lives they were able to save - even Mengele, who actually patted himself on the back for the ""experiments"" that saved Jews from the gas chamber, and the people he directed out of the death line. Germans who had access to food, clothing, shelter, blankets were able to share them if they were inclined to. Germans who had access to nothing had nothing to share.Another powerful scene was the scene where the Zyklon-B had become diluted thanks to Gerstein's attempt to make it unusable. The Camp officials decided to use it anyway. Kapos who were working the ovens complained that they were throwing living bodies into the ovens who had not yet died. For their complaints, they were immediately shot.People in Hitler's Germany knew that was the price to be paid for dissidence. You obeyed authority or you died. Don't forget that the Prussians were a people who invented the public school system that created a people incapable of questioning authority. The very system all public schools are based upon today.Gerstein was in a no-win situation. The movie raises the question, but gives us no answers. It is important that we all consider the question, and where each of us would draw the line. We may confront that decision sooner than we think.Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel, and Women's Liberation",5,The price of dissidence,1176940800,"04 19, 2007",2007,4228,"['story', 'SS', 'Officer', 'Kurt', 'Gerstein', 'good', 'Nazi', 'who', 'was', 'good', 'job', 'believed', 'work', 'realized', 'what', 'was', 'first', 'experience', 'concept', 'good', 'Nazi', 'especially', 'one', 'ranks', 'SS', 'story', 'claims', 'be', 'true', 'Gerstein', 'character', 'real', 'Catholic', 'Priest', 'who', 'help', 'fictional', 'character', 'composite', 'others', 'Still', ""'ve"", 'done', 'lot', 'reading', 'holocaust', 'have', 'yet', 'find', 'Catholic', 'Priest', 'who', 'actually', 'worked', 'ovens', 'Please', 'Nazis', 'made', 'Jews', 'do', 'made', 'do', 'reason', 'Nazis', 'were', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'did', 'mental', 'torture', 'made', 'physical', 'torture', 'exquisite.Gerstein', 'area', 'expertise', 'was', 'disinfection', 'had', 'idea', 'apparently', 'what', 'final', 'solution', 'was', 'about', 'Most', 'Germans', 'did', 'not', 'did', 'were', 'complete', 'denial', 'Denial', 'not', 'that', 'believe', 'are', 'living', 'now.It', ""n't"", 'Gerstin', 'actually', 'look', 'peephole', 'gas', 'chamber', 'contained', 'could', 'see', 'naked', 'bodies', 'climbing', 'other', 'weakest', 'bottom', 'order', 'get', 'what', 'air', 'was', 'left', 'top', 'Apparently', 'other', 'Nazis', 'were', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'was', 'must', 'be', 'eyes', 'God', 'hell', 'Priest', 'A', 'great', 'line', ""'m"", 'sure', 'God', 'had', 'lots', 'eyes', 'hell.With', 'attempt', 'work', 'system', 'many', 'continue', 'do', 'own', 'corrupt', 'systems', 'protests', 'are', 'familiar', 'are', 'war', 'When', 'war', 'bets', 'are', 'Germans', 'are', 'incapable', 'such', 'attrocities', 'How', 'often', 'have', 'heard', 'bureaucracies', 'could', ""n't"", 'organize', 'conspiracy', 'wipe', 'own', 'noses', 'Protestations', 'were', 'dismissed', 'rumors', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'sigh', 'more', 'things', 'change', 'Jews', 'left', 'America', 'long', 'ago', 'proof', 'Just', 'proof', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'happening', 'scene', 'Germans', 'celebrating', 'Christmas', 'fancy', 'dinner', 'fancy', 'liquor', 'singing', 'Silent', 'Night', 'when', 'just', 'know', 'ashes', 'dead', 'are', 'falling', 'mixed', 'snow', 'probably', 'creepiest', 'scene.The', 'Pope', 'never', 'even', 'pronounced', 'word', 'Jew', 'Concentration', 'Camp', 'Just', 'so', 'many', 'Presidents', 'who', 'never', 'pronounced', 'word', 'AIDS', 'refuse', 'negotiate', 'Nazis', 'do', ""n't"", 'negotiate', 'terrorists', 'Jews', 'are', 'being', 'sent', 'labor', 'camps', 'Certainly', 'not', 'being', 'tortured', 'killed', 'One', 'line', 'question', 'SS', 'who', 'betraying', 'country', 'appear', 'Vatican', 'What', 'kind', 'Catch', '22', 'refuse', 'take', 'hard', 'line', 'Gerstein', 'was', 'coward', 'who', 'did', 'nothing', 'easy', 'armchair', 'quarterbacks', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'presume', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'stop', 'machine', 'was', 'Fascism', 'Many', 'people', 'tried', 'Apparently', 'Gerstein', 'was', 'one', 'Many', 'Germans', 'tried', 'work', 'system', 'console', 'lives', 'were', 'able', 'save', 'even', 'Mengele', 'who', 'actually', 'patted', 'back', 'experiments', 'saved', 'Jews', 'gas', 'chamber', 'people', 'directed', 'death', 'line', 'Germans', 'who', 'had', 'access', 'food', 'clothing', 'shelter', 'blankets', 'were', 'able', 'share', 'were', 'inclined', 'Germans', 'who', 'had', 'access', 'nothing', 'had', 'nothing', 'share.Another', 'powerful', 'scene', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'Zyklon-B', 'had', 'become', 'diluted', 'thanks', 'Gerstein', 'attempt', 'make', 'unusable', 'Camp', 'officials', 'decided', 'use', 'anyway', 'Kapos', 'who', 'were', 'working', 'ovens', 'complained', 'were', 'throwing', 'living', 'bodies', 'ovens', 'who', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'died', 'complaints', 'were', 'immediately', 'shot.People', 'Hitler', 'Germany', 'knew', 'was', 'price', 'be', 'paid', 'dissidence', 'obeyed', 'authority', 'died', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Prussians', 'were', 'people', 'who', 'invented', 'public', 'school', 'system', 'created', 'people', 'incapable', 'questioning', 'authority', 'very', 'system', 'public', 'schools', 'are', 'based', 'today.Gerstein', 'was', 'no-win', 'situation', 'movie', 'question', 'answers', 'important', 'consider', 'question', 'where', 'would', 'draw', 'line', 'may', 'confront', 'decision', 'sooner', 'think.Scapegoat', 'Jews', 'Israel', 'Women', 'Liberation']",N/A

Because the subject matter is so heinous in nature, so loaded in history, and so prone to polarize audiences, what we have seen before this film AMEN is the horror of the fate of the Jews in graphic detail (The Pianist, Schindler's List, The Grey Zone, Bent, Paragraph 175, to name but a few).  What Costa-Gavras has done is show us all of the same information, but from the stance of an SS officer who found the Final Solution appalling and fought to have it stopped.  When his own efforts to quell the production of the killer gas crystals do not work, he seeks help from the Vatican.  But as history has shown us Pope Pius XII failed the world, fearing more for the threat on the Vatican.  The cold reception by the American envoys, concerned about battles to be won, support of Stalin and other allies, etc, even suggesting that the US did not want to accept large numbers of Jews as refugees as they would create an anti-Semitic problem for the US! No one escapes Costa-Gavras scathing eye with the exception of a priest within the Vatican who as a last resort places a yellow star of David on his cassock and is gassed with his fellow men, the Jews.  The SS officer formally charges the Nazi regime in the language of the Italians, the French, the German people, and the Americans and for this act of bravery his is incarcerated.How much is fact and how much is story telling really makes little difference in this brilliant film.  AMEN makes the world take responsibility for the Holocaust and  only when we  can accept the entire gamut of this horrid mark on history can we be ready to take action to protect against its recurrence.Many complaints have been made against the ""dubbing"" of the dialogue.

758695,A29XWXJ525HH7O,B00009W0W4,MyD -- The Viewpoint,"[15, 19]","Put aside some of the controversy surrounding this movie for a moment and let me make the case for why it is even more introspective than accusatory (regardless of whatever the director intended).  It does not focus so much on visuals of genocide as it does the process of how a modern, educated, faithful society becomes complacent, complicit, and even enamored with radical ideas.This is a partially fictionalized story of a true figure involved in ""The Final Solution"", chemist Kurt Gerstein.  Many of the persons surrounding him are fictional and used as a vehicle to illustrate the varying levels of conscience or courage.  I suggest that the viewer look at the church in this instance as one of the individuals or characters that embody a degree of reaction.  I cannot attest to the complete accuracy of this movie.  However, history is pretty clear on at least the generalities.  We cannot choose to ignore history just because it's unflattering.THE PLOT: Chemist Kurt Gerstein is involved in developing methods of fighting the Typhus disease and is commissioned into the infamous Waffen SS.  He soon discovers his chemical methods are also being introduced into the process of genocide at concentration camps in the form of gas chambers.  He is invited to Poland and actually shown the process as SS officers view the extermination of human beings through glass peep holes.  Gerstein recoils in awful realization, but remains mute in an act of caution.  The other SS officers react in combinations of fascination, achievement and horror as they absorb the image.  Gerstein returns and attempts to organize action against the genocide behind the scenes, but also continues in the program in order to gain information and sometimes hinder the process.  When pressured, he does give the SS help improving the process and gains more of their esteem.Around Gerstein we find many types of reaction.  There are those who are willing to openly fight the practice.  Generally, they are constrained by those who are afraid of the Nazi regime.  There are those who are blissfully ignorant, they are portrayed as few.  There are those who are wildly devoted to anything the Third Reich does.  One very interesting character that steals a lot of attention is the enigmatic and eerily, morally ambiguous ""Doctor"" who is Gerstien's friend (remember the plot itself is fictionalized).  The Doctor is involved early on with the euthanization of mental patients and is elevated in the SS to where he appears to actually run the process at one of the concentration camps.  He is an example of a highly educated person who does not buy into the ideology, but is more than willing to play the part and set aside conscience in order to survive and thrive.  Ulrich M&uuml;he does an amazing job in this role and the dialog he is given is chilling at times.Also with Gerstein is a young priest who tries to help him gain the Pope's ear.  The idea is that when the Pope publically denounces the genocide, world powers will have to react more specifically.  This mostly powerless priest becomes disenchanted with the church's response and puts himself in harms way as a means of protest.  In the movie, the Catholic Church is worried about the continued existence of the Vatican in the face of Nazi and Italian powers, not to mention it's vast art collection (when everything else was being stolen).  In contrast, The church had been instrumental in stopping the euthanasia of mental patients at the start of the movie. Those worried about the Church's image will be heartened to know that the priest is the ultimate example of courage and conscience depicted here.I said this movie is more introspective than accusatory.  I believe this because it mainly points the finger at everyone, not just the church.  It essentially says most everyone was either complacent or complicit or culpable, therefor we all have to look to our part and be introspective.  Even the allies are aware of what is happening, yet their diplomats frankly tell would-be exposers that they are more interested in winning the war and cannot risk slowing that process by negotiating over Jews.  The Doctor flatly tells the priest, while confronting him at a concentration camp, that he knows Germany will loose the war.  He tells the priest that they tried to negotiate using Hungarian Jews on their way to death.... no one was interested.Importantly, when the priest tells the Doctor ""the world will know what you are doing"" the doctor replies ominously ""YOU SEE... THE WORLD ALREADY KNOWS...  AND YET... DIVINE ANGER IS NOT RUMBLING FROM THE SKIES.""In the end I think this movie is much better at illustrating how people are reasonable inside their mind, yet go along with whatever is happening because of fear, ignorance or desire for personal gain.  People just want to maintain their existence.  We see it in any era.  People fail to stand up in their lives out of fear for much lesser threats than the Third Reich.  This movie dissects how the individual reacts to these events from one end of the spectrum to the other.  It is more of a parable than exact history, though it points to history in general.  It is a cautionary tale for any time.A Tour de Force!",5,"VARYING DEGREES OF CONSCIENCE AND COURAGE--  Partially fictionalized, but important Holocaust movie",1402358400,"06 10,

758696,A2K6VDHSE2NU4R,B00009W0W4,Nachtjager,"[7, 8]","Overall, this is a must-have flick for WWII history buffs.  It tells the story of Kurt Gerstein reasonably well and the fellow playing his part does a great job.  The characters are good, the storyline is good, the historical events are a little off here and there, but overall, the movie stays on course and is worth buying.My peeves with this movie may seem trivial, but I am a history buff and if you're going to do a movie like this, get the details right because those details kept distracting me.  There were many errors in the movie regarding uniforms, rank insignia, flags, and a number of other things.  The sinister looking black SS uniforms are used throughout the movie by Concentration Camp officers and SD personel, when in reality, those uniforms were gone by 1940.  SD/SS officers also did not wear ""SS"" collar patches, nor did concentration camp personel.  SD men wore blank black collar patches, camp guards and officers wore the Totenkopf skulls or blank black collar patches as well.  Also, Gerstein's rank insignia changes inexplicably several times in the movie, which would seem to be a continuity problem.  In addition to that, for some reason, the SS offices throughout the movie are festooned and bedecked with Hitler Youth flags, which made no sense to me at all, and early in the movie, SA and SS troops are marching carrying Hitler Youth banners - just seems like poor research on the technical end.Lastly, the gassing which Gerstein witnessed is not portrayed accurately and I have no idea why, as this is the most important part of the movie.  His ""confession"" is easily found and he describes the scene, and the scene in the movie doesn't match at all.  Why?

758698,A1SMU2LDMEIBWJ,B00009W0W4,P. Toche,"[8, 10]","This movie explores the theme of collective guilt in the Holocaust by focusing on two individuals who stand out of their collectivity, SS officer Kurt Gerstein (Ulrich Tukur) and Catholic priest Riccardo Fontana (Mathieu Kassovitz).A chemist by profession, Gerstein supplies zyklon B gas for the gas chambers of the death camps, but tries to alert the allies of the horror in which he is a willing participant. Hard to believe, but allegedly based on fact. A priest by vocation, Fontana tries to use his family contacts to alert the Pope.Neither the SS officer nor the Catholic priest succeed. The Allies ignore the nazi. The Pope ignores the priest. The cowardly officer kills himself. The brave priest martyrs himself by boarding an Aushwitz-bound train.Based on the movie's reconstruction, SS officer Gerstein was a coward and guilty through and through of high-level complicity in a Genocide. He would no doubt have received a heavy sentence after the war, and deservedly so.This SS officer deserves no sympathy. The authors have therefore thrown in a few Faustian baits for those who need the idea of the good nazi.The success of Schindler's Ark/List demonstrates the existence of a need for a belief in the good nazi. Here we have a would-be good nazi. He would like to be good, but he is so cowardly that he fails in his attempt to do good through the courage of others. In this sense, SS Gerstein is more interesting, dramatically speaking, than Schindler. He is a total loser and, in this, immensely dramatic. By Hollywood standard, not quite the ticket.Catholic priest Fontana was a good guy who martyred himself in total despair. He is a modern version of Jesus, who died to expiate humanity's guilt. Fontana is a composite of several real-life catholic martyrs. The list of Catholic victims under the nazis is a long one, especially among the Poles. Not quite as long as the list of Jewish victims though. The complicit silence of the Catholic Church is well documented, but unfortunately not well publicized and occasionally denied.If I dared to be controversial, I might write that Amen does to the Catholic community what Shindler's List did to the nazi community.The greatest merit of a movie like Amen is to publicize Pope Pius 12's guilty silence while not, perhaps, alienating the entire Catholic community.I also wish to add that Mathieu Kassovitz does an outstanding job as the Catholic priest. Another reader suggested otherwise. I have seen young Catholic priests in the flesh, and I believe Mathieu Kassovitz is perfect, a wonderful actor.Great actors. True story.

This looked like a typical cord puller showing the zombies in the camp, moms walking with children to their death, evil crazy Nazis, yada, yada, yada.Luckily, the director Costa-Gravis has experience with movies with political themes and undertones, Z being his most famous.  Here the scenes of atrocities are indirect rather than direct.  You seen trains, lots of trains, going full and returning empty.  You see smokestacks burning and the emotional reactions when the real truth is known.  This was done with a nice touch rather than a heavy hand.The movie is based on a real SS mole who vainly tries to get the word out.  He is in charge of army disinfection, and finds out the hard way what the poisons are really being used for.  He ends up being both sympathetic (perhaps too much, considering his position) and tragic.  You follow him throughout and after the war.  To the bitter end.Throughout the movie, I just sat in amazement to the lame excuses used again and again by the pope and other countries in response to the holocaust.  Even when the Nazis start taking jews in the view of the vatican what does his eminence do?  Take a guess.  There was a lunch scene with vatican cardinals and ambassadors where all of the standard responses to do nothing are raised.  They just didn't get it.From an interview with Gavras the inevitable question of ""Did they Know?"" arose.  ""Everybody knew"", he responded.  And this is the rub.  We are not talking about Germans here.  We are talking about the people who knew from the allied side of the war.  Americans, British, French.  Hell, even the pope knew and they all had a reason not to respond.Their only saving grace is that ""maybe"" they didn't understand the scope of the genocide.  They had enough people telling them the truth, but once again, they just didn't get it.  One scene that emphasizes this position is where the US ambassador is told that 10,000 jews are being killed daily.  He replies, ""You'll have a better chance of being believed if you say hundreds, instead.The Catholic church made a pact with the devil called Hitler.  In the beginning, they had their reasons for this pact, but when faced with the truth, they ran the other way.  One priest in the movie asks ""Do we want to save the Vatican or Christianity.""

Kurt Gerstein (Ulrich Tukur), was a scientist whose eyewitness report was used as a document to verify the extermination camps. Gerstein was a chemical engineer and army lieutenant working on purifying the drinking water to stop the spread of typhus.Through his father&#8217;s connections with the Gestapo, he was recruited by the Doctor (Ulrich Muhe) into the SS for his chemical skills. He developed Zyklon B, the gas used in the Nazi mass asphyxiation chambers, as he naively thought this compound would only be used to purify water. Through the program&#8217;s success, Gerstein&#8217;s status rose.The film unmasks the perpetrators of this evil and illustrates the thin line walked by those courageous enough to mount some form of protest. Costa-Gavras points out the moral deficiencies of both the Church and political leaders to do anything to halt the Holocaust. The strength of the movie is not in bringing out new information but in underscoring that millions of lives might have been spared if more people had acted.Blu-ray features include audio commentary with Costa-Gavras and the BBC documentary &#8220;Pope Pius XII: The Pope, The Jews, and the Nazis.&#8221;",5,Fascinating Tale of World War II Complacency,1404086400,"06 30, 2014",2014,1348,"['8220', 'Amen', '34', 'film', 'Costa-Gavras', 'exploration', 'Catholic', 'Church', '8217', 's', 'failure', 'speak', 'out', 'Holocaust', 'even', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'Kurt', 'Gerstein', 'Ulrich', 'Tukur', 'was', 'scientist', 'eyewitness', 'report', 'was', 'used', 'document', 'verify', 'extermination', 'camps', 'Gerstein', 'was', 'chemical', 'engineer', 'army', 'lieutenant', 'working', 'purifying', 'drinking', 'water', 'stop', 'spread', 'father', '8217', 's', 'connections', 'Gestapo', 'was', 'recruited', 'Doctor', 'Ulrich', 'Muhe', 'SS', 'chemical', 'skills', 'developed', 'Zyklon', 'B', 'gas', 'used', 'Nazi', 'mass', 'asphyxiation', 'chambers', 'naively', 'thought', 'compound', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'used', 'purify', 'water', 'program', '8217', 's', 'success', 'Gerstein', '8217', 'status', 'rose.The', 'film', 'perpetrators', 'evil', 'thin', 'line', 'walked', 'courageous', 'enough', 'mount', 'form', 'protest', 'Costa-Gavras', 'points', 'out', 'moral', 'deficiencies', 'Church', 'political', 'leaders', 'do', 'anything', 'halt', 'Holocaust', 'strength', 'movie', 'not', 'bringing', 'out', 'new', 'information', 'underscoring', 'millions', 'lives', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'spared', 'more', 'people', 'had', 'acted.Blu-ray', 'features', 'include', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Costa-Gavras', 'BBC', 'documentary', '8220', 'Pope', 'Pius', 'XII', 'Pope', 'Jews', 'Nazis.', '8221']",N/A
758703,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B00009W0W4,Timothy Kearney,"[113, 132]","As far as films dealing with the Holocaust are concerned, I do not believe that AMEN is in the same category as LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL or SCHINDLER'S LIST. I say this not so much because of the film's quality, but due to the fact it is really a morality tale about what happens when people who are basically good fail to see obvious evil, do little to nothing about it, and in the end may even be aiding the evil that so opposes good. The Holocaust is merely the backdrop, and the failure of organized religion to oppose the evil of Holocaust is history's best example to demonstrate what happens when people do not oppose evil.At the beginning of the film, people of the Christian faith seem to be doing the right thing. People with mental and physical disabilities are being sent to the death camps, and churches, particularly the Roman Catholic Church boldly speak against the atrocity. Yet when the same thing happens to the Jews, the vigilant churches remain indifferent at best, and in more cases than not, silent. The more the churches realize the atrocities, the more deafening the silence becomes.Amen breaks new ground as far as the discussion is concerned. Much has been made about the silence of the Vatican in general, and more specifically Pope Pius XII's failure to speak. The film could have used the easy answer, namely fear that the Vatican would be destroyed, and would therefore destroy the Church as well. While this is mentioned in the film, it really does not seem to be the major reason for the silence. The choice for the Church was either to side with the Allies, which included Russia, a Communist nation. The Communists were viewed as more evil since Communists opposed religion. The Axis powers were just as evil as Stalin, but at least they allowed the practice of the faith as long as the Church was not critical of the Nazi Regime. This seems to be the more accurate reason for the silence.Many people who will see this film will see the Catholic Church in a less than positive light. I'm not certain this is accurate. The character of Fr. Riccardo Fontana is one of the two heroes of the film; he is Catholic, and actually stands for what is best in the Church. Keep in mind, the greatest Christians, Catholic and non-Catholic, are more often than not the heroes who stand alone, and the heroism of one who stands alone is probably a more powerful example of faith than any religious officials. We see in the character of Fontana one who makes a morally good choice and acts on it as opposed to the hierarchy, who made a bad moral choice of choosing what they believed was the lesser of two evils. Fontana is actually a Christ figure and his actions teach us how we should be acting. Also, people viewing the film should keep in mind that while the Catholic Church is the Church that is viewed as wrong, none off the other Christian denominations  did all that much to stand up to the evil either.

The film has some historical inaccuracies as far as the events that really took place,(Zyklon B was only used at Auschwitz-Birkenau, and Majdanek) but these shortcomings are easily forgiven just to have this story finally be told.  Gerstines' actual written report about the gassing of a convoy of Jews in the Belzec extermination camp, using carbon monoxide chambers, remains one of the most horrifying documents ever to appear in print.  In fact, one of the most disturbing aspects of this movie is the realization that there were thousands of people who devoted much of their time and effort to create a method of killing thousands of people at a time in mere hours, and then worked to streamline that process of mass murder to an industrial level.  Through trial and error, they would, at Auschwitz-Birkenau, actually reach the point of being able to kill and destroy the remains of over 6000 people in just a few hours.  Since the film at least tries to tell Gerstines' story, and makes it clear that at least one Nazi officer was truly haunted by the events taking place is a single fact, that alone, makes it worth the purchase.  To learn that someone from the inside tried to muster the courage to inform the world, shows us that not all Nazi's were cold blooded killers.  All evil needs to take root and grow is for good men to do nothing.  It is those good men in this story, many of whom were in positions of real power, who, after being informed through first hand accounts of the horrific events taking place, then said and did nothing, thus allowing the mass murders to continue.  To be a knowledgeable, but silent bystander of such horrible events has, through hindsight, cast a hugh blanket of guilt over those who found themselves in this very position, and it's changed the way they are now viewed in history.  However, it is this kind of silence, and your reaction to it, that actually touches at the very heart of the story.  It makes you ask yourself the question, ""What would I do in such a situation""? Would I do the right thing?  It also reminds us that there were indeed people at the time, who, often acting alone, stepped up and answered this moral imparative through heroic actions, rather than stopping at mere words.  After seeing this film, you'll never look at a train made up of boxcars in the same way again.  They send chills down your back every time one passes in the movie, and they pass with alarming frequency as the film progresses.All in all, it's an excellent movie about a little known chapter in the history of the Holocaust.

While it doesn't have is the rough and raw anger of his early classics, or the emotional weight of Missing, it's a compelling tale well told. Based on the true story of a German chemist and devout Catholic promoted to the SS who, on finding out what use the chemicals he inspected are really put to, tried to make the existence of the Nazi extermination policy known in the hopes of stopping it (not without precedent: as the film shows, the Catholic Church and public outrage did prevent the earlier extermination program for the mentally ill). Unfortunately for the would-be whistleblower, no-one wanted to know: they either didn't care or didn't believe the sheer enormity of the numbers of victims.Ulrich Tukur is impressive in the lead, portraying the moral outrage and frustrated urgency without resorting to theatrics, though Matthieu Kassovitz's priest (a composite of several characters) is less convincing despite his best efforts. The most interesting character, however, is Ulrich Muhe's `Doctor,' a fellow SS officer unconvinced by the Nazi rhetoric but more than morally ambivalent and pragmatic enough to go along with his `unsophisticated' colleagues. He's a constantly unnerving presence because of his honesty and his playfulness: you're never quite sure what his position is, although you never doubt his own certainty in himself.Much was made at the time of release at the finger pointed at the Catholic Church for their complicity by silence in the Holocaust, but the film doesn't limit its frustration to the Church - the Allies are equally culpable of pragmatic neglect. The script is an impressively constructed, with early scenes flowing effortlessly into each other as they demolish the concept that ordinary Germans were powerless to resist, establishing a moral framework for the drama that follows. The resolution of Kassovitz's character veers into clich&eacute; and the enormity of the main character's loss of faith is slightly taken for granted at the end (his final action is a total rejection of the fundamental principles of Catholicism that fuel his doomed efforts), but it's nonetheless a powerful movie that deserves to be better known.",5,The would-be whistleblower of the Holocaust,1140393600,"02 20, 2006",2006,2307,"['Amen', 'got', 'indifferent', 'response', 'critics', 'box-office', 'alike', 'easily', 'Costa-Gavras', 'best', 'film', 'couple', 'decades', ""n't"", 'have', 'rough', 'raw', 'anger', 'early', 'classics', 'emotional', 'weight', 'Missing', 'compelling', 'tale', 'well', 'told', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'German', 'chemist', 'devout', 'Catholic', 'promoted', 'SS', 'who', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'chemicals', 'inspected', 'are', 'really', 'put', 'tried', 'make', 'existence', 'Nazi', 'extermination', 'policy', 'known', 'hopes', 'stopping', 'not', 'precedent', 'film', 'shows', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'public', 'outrage', 'did', 'prevent', 'earlier', 'extermination', 'program', 'mentally', 'ill', 'Unfortunately', 'would-be', 'whistleblower', 'no-one', 'wanted', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'sheer', 'enormity', 'numbers', 'victims.Ulrich', 'Tukur', 'impressive', 'lead', 'portraying', 'moral', 'outrage', 'frustrated', 'urgency', 'resorting', 'theatrics', 'Matthieu', 'Kassovitz', 'priest', 'composite', 'several', 'characters', 'less', 'convincing', 'best', 'efforts', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'however', 'Ulrich', 'Muhe', 'Doctor', 'fellow', 'SS', 'officer', 'unconvinced', 'Nazi', 'rhetoric', 'more', 'morally', 'ambivalent', 'pragmatic', 'enough', 'go', 'along', 'unsophisticated', 'colleagues', 'constantly', 'unnerving', 'presence', 'honesty', 'playfulness', ""'re"", 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'position', 'never', 'doubt', 'own', 'certainty', 'himself.Much', 'was', 'made', 'time', 'release', 'finger', 'pointed', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'complicity', 'silence', 'Holocaust', 'film', ""n't"", 'limit', 'frustration', 'Church', 'Allies', 'are', 'equally', 'culpable', 'pragmatic', 'neglect', 'script', 'impressively', 'constructed', 'early', 'scenes', 'flowing', 'effortlessly', 'other', 'demolish', 'concept', 'ordinary', 'Germans', 'were', 'powerless', 'resist', 'establishing', 'moral', 'framework', 'drama', 'resolution', 'Kassovitz', 'character', 'veers', 'clich', 'eacute', 'enormity', 'main', 'character', 'loss', 'faith', 'slightly', 'taken', 'granted', 'end', 'final', 'action', 'total', 'rejection', 'fundamental', 'principles', 'Catholicism', 'fuel', 'doomed', 'efforts', 'nonetheless', 'powerful', 'movie', 'be', 'better', 'known']",N/A

Set during WW II, ""Amen"" veers back and forth between the two leads. Kurt Gerstein [Ulrich Tukur] is an SS officer/chemist who discovers that his chemical invention to destroy vermin is being used to eliminate Germany of those the Nazi term 'undesirables', i.e. Jews. When he witnesses for himself an actual gassing, he is horrified and his conscience as a Christian is aroused. Initially he tries to get help from his own church, but when his pleas fall on deaf ears, he brings the matter to the Catholic church. Here, Gerstein finds an 'ally' in a young, idealistic Catholic priest, Father Riccardo [Mathieu Kassovitz] who tries his best to get his superiors and also the Pope to intervene.Well, we know the history - the Vatican was neutral during WW II, and Pope Pius XII basically turned a deaf ear to the plight of European Jewry. Perceiving the Third Reich's threat to the Vatican as being very real, the Catholic Church decided it was wiser to stay out of the entire mess and not intervene, even if condemning the Nazi atrocities would have sent a powerful message to the world and turned public opinion against the Nazis. Instead, disgusting politics won the day - the Vatican felt that denouncing Hitler was equivalent to allying with Stalin and Communism, and so between the two evils, the Vatican chose to be neutral, or rather indifferent.This is a controversial movie in that it paints an unflattering portrait of the Vatican during WW II. Also, the delineation between good and evil is not always clear, and that makes for interesting viewing and debate. Kurt Gerstein was an actual historical figure, but the Catholic priest who tries so valiantly to publicise the atrocities and get help from his church is a fictional character [or rather a composite of a couple of real-life religious figures, i.e. priests who risked their own lives to denounce the Nazis, and suffered greatly as a result].The scenes of serenity in the Vatican and its grounds are portrayed beautifully in full, rich color, contrasting starkly with the horrors inflicted upon the Jews by the Nazis.
