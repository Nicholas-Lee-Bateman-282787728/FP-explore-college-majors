1504946,A1HCCW38EQQBTY,B005WWJISG,"D. Baker ""Blackworm""","[0, 0]","This was clearly low-budget, but the storyline kept my interest.  Vic, a nasty and conniving runner, sought to terrorize his former girlfriend into coming back to him and destroy his buddy's relationship with his fiancee by destroying her.  Wow.  Gotta give it to Bryce Wilson...he can play subdued evil to the hilt.  His motto, ""Divide and conquer"", seemed to be his unholy grail to getting back at those who he felt wronged him.  Just when I thought it was all over, the ending hit me in the face like a ton of bricks!  I don't know if there is going to be a ""JURY"" the sequel or not.  Personally, I don't forsee it, so I won't go on for fear of spilling the ending.  A movie with some merit, if you can get past some of the other stuff, like the stilted acting from some of the players and the cinematography, which was a little dark for me.",4,When a slightly upscale engagement party goes terribly wrong.,1340582400,"06 25, 2012",2012,844,"['was', 'clearly', 'low-budget', 'storyline', 'kept', 'interest', 'Vic', 'nasty', 'conniving', 'runner', 'sought', 'terrorize', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'coming', 'back', 'destroy', 'buddy', 'relationship', 'fiancee', 'destroying', 'Wow', 'Got', 'ta', 'give', 'Bryce', 'Wilson', 'can', 'play', 'subdued', 'evil', 'hilt', 'motto', 'Divide', 'conquer', 'seemed', 'be', 'unholy', 'grail', 'getting', 'back', 'who', 'felt', 'wronged', 'Just', 'when', 'thought', 'was', 'ending', 'hit', 'face', 'ton', 'bricks', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'going', 'be', 'JURY', 'sequel', 'not', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'forsee', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'fear', 'spilling', 'ending', 'movie', 'merit', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'other', 'stuff', 'stilted', 'acting', 'players', 'cinematography', 'was', 'little', 'dark']",Jury of Our Peers

It was just above low budget with the acting and flow. Some of the actors seemed so robotic with their acting and lines which took away from the quality of the movie and made it hard to watch.,3,Just ok!,1336262400,"05 6, 2012",2012,312,"['Was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'movie', 'Was', 'very', 'disappointed.This', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'just', 'above', 'low', 'budget', 'acting', 'flow', 'actors', 'seemed', 'so', 'robotic', 'acting', 'lines', 'took', 'away', 'quality', 'movie', 'made', 'hard', 'watch']",Jury of Our Peers
