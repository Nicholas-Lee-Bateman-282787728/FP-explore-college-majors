1359635,A3VXR9XIG0KOXH,B003R0MEZO,CZerega,"[0, 0]","This season picks up from season 10's cliff hanger. I would say the last 3 seasons would be referred as the Nate Haskell/Dick & Jane saga. The only downside to this season is it continues into the 12th season, but it closes the DIck and Jane killer story.Some featured episodes that stood out to me were:-'Sqweegel' was about a forensic-proof serial killer. This could have easily been into a CSI movie due to how original and detailel it was in the series.-'House of Hoarders' only because I know the rise in interest with viewers with shows like Hoarders: Buried Alive or Animal Hoarders.-'The Two Mrs. Grissoms' was a different way of solving crimes when Sara going to a scholarship foundation for the deaf when a car bomb goes off.-'Unleashed&#34; which involves a woman getting mauled by a mountain lion and another case with a pregnant 17 year old who is harassed by cyberbullying.-The last three episodes are back-to-back in a cat and mouse game between Dr. Ray Langston and Nate Haskell.Some recurring or guest appearances in this season is Justin Bieber (2 appearances), Dita Von Teese (1 episode), Gil Grissom makes 1 appearance as well as Lady Heather.Overall this is a very structured season and it is sad that it comes to a conclusion.",5,11 years in the business,1363478400,"03 17, 2013",2013,1248,"['season', 'up', 'season', '10', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'would', 'say', 'last', '3', 'seasons', 'would', 'be', 'referred', 'Nate', 'Haskell/Dick', 'Jane', 'saga', 'only', 'downside', 'season', '12th', 'season', 'DIck', 'Jane', 'killer', 'story.Some', 'featured', 'episodes', 'stood', 'out', 'were', ""-'Sqweegel"", 'was', 'forensic-proof', 'serial', 'killer', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'CSI', 'movie', 'due', 'how', 'original', 'detailel', 'was', ""series.-'House"", 'Hoarders', 'only', 'know', 'rise', 'interest', 'viewers', 'shows', 'Hoarders', 'Buried', 'Alive', 'Animal', ""Hoarders.-'The"", 'Two', 'Mrs.', 'Grissoms', 'was', 'different', 'way', 'solving', 'crimes', 'when', 'Sara', 'going', 'scholarship', 'foundation', 'deaf', 'when', 'car', 'bomb', ""off.-'Unleashed"", '34', 'woman', 'getting', 'mauled', 'mountain', 'lion', 'case', 'pregnant', '17', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'harassed', 'cyberbullying.-The', 'last', 'three', 'episodes', 'are', 'back-to-back', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'Dr.', 'Ray', 'Langston', 'Nate', 'Haskell.Some', 'recurring', 'guest', 'appearances', 'season', 'Justin', 'Bieber', '2', 'appearances', 'Dita', 'Von', 'Teese', '1', 'episode', 'Gil', 'Grissom', '1', 'appearance', 'as', 'well', 'Lady', 'Heather.Overall', 'very', 'structured', 'season', 'sad', 'conclusion']",CSI: Crime Scene Investigation - Season 11

1359643,A3U331IS53QQDY,B003R0MEZO,Jared P. Baratta,"[0, 3]","First, I want it on the record that I have nothing but contempt, disrespect & loathing for that Canadian baby Justin Bieber. I cannot believe that little brat invaded my show. That being said, I will not take away what a BIG name he is & even he should have done commentary on the Season Premiere SHOCK WAVES & TARGETS OF OBSESSION. Bieber joined the ranks of Faye Dunaway, Liev Schrieber, Ned Beatty, Ruby Dee, James Whitmore, Peter Stormare, Jewel, where a BIG name gets no motice on the DVD. That routine BIG name ignorance brings us to POOL SHARK, with Elliott Gould. You cannot deny his impact on film & television. Elliott Gould found himself in the same season being slighted the way Bieber was. POOL SHARK also was the return of Drops & just like P0PPIN TAGS(6), BIG SHOTS(7) & DROPS OUT(8), Method Man was not called in toe record commentary. POOL SHARK also had a surprise return of Wendy Simms(Liz Vassey in her final episode) where she & Hodges discussed his failure in not sealing the deal as far as a romance was concerned. Where the f()&lt;k was the commentary from Gould, Method Man, Holly Madison, Vassey & Wallace Langham? POOL SHARK also revisited Sam Braun & POOL SHARK still got nothing.FRACKED touched upon the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing used to harvest natural gas & drill for oil at the same time. So FRACKED followed suit with UNFRIENDLY SKIES(1), ANATOMY OF A LYE(2), AFTER THE SHOW(4) & I LIKE TO WATCH(6) in being a ripped from the headlines episode that gets dick on DVD.THE 2 MRS. GRISSOMS-do I really need to spell it out for you? Fine, I will. We meet Grissom's mom Elizabeth who's stone deaf, we meet Julia Holden, Grissom's ex-girlfriend, we see Sara being treated with contempt by Mama Grissom. We see Sara having Julia shove their relationship in her face. Marlee Matlin-BIG name, no notice. Phyllis Frelich was also spectacular as Elizabeth Grissom. We also had the first physical appearance of Grissom since 1 TO GO in Season 9 albeit via Skype. Character development, BIG name, the return of C.S.I.'s star, no commentary on this is inexcusable. Marlee Matlin CAN speak, as for Frelich I don't know, but their commentary could have been converted into text to be read on screen. JorJa Fox was also needed. I want Carol Mendolsohn to explain to me like a child using simple words how this did not get commentary.TUNE IN, TURN OUT, DROP DEAD was an episode loaded with gallows humor & the comedic goldmine that is Howard Hesseman.THE LIST, another Brass polishing that quickly tarnished by not getting commentary. We lost the much beloved Sam Vega played with masterful craft by Geoffrey Rivas. It was heartbreaking to have Vega commit suicide. Where was the commentary from Paul Guilfoyle & Geoffrey Rivas?HITTING FOR THE CYCLE-another humorous gem that was as brilliantly executed as TOE TAGS in Season 7.UNLEASHED-the return of Lady Heather, the only time Lady Heather appeared without Grissom, with Langston, where Langston himself found fascination with our favorite retired dominatrix. MELINDA CLARKE SHOULD HAVE RECORDED COMMENTARY ON EVERY LADY HEATHER EPISODE!!!!!! Try to say otherwise to me, I double-dog dare ya.FATHER OF THE BRIDE-Langston's ex-wife is introduced along with her new husband who find themselves targeted by Nathan Haskell. Bill Irwin neither being interviewed nor called in for commentary is SHAMEFUL!!!!! Haskell was easily C.S.I.'s mosst diabolical serial killer. Haskell is the very person responsible for giving then taking Langston away from us. Theirs was a symbiotic relattionship & together Irwin & Fishburne never were interviewed together, never did commentary together. Bill Irwin was reduced as an actor by not getting any attention paid to him on the DVD again despite being what brought to & later removed Fishburne from the series. FATHER OF THE BRIDE also brought back Sofia Curtis who had not been seen since GO TO HELL in Season 8.CELLO & GOODBYE-more fodder for the Haskell storyline & like HOLLYWOOD BRASS, brought Las Vegas to Los Angeles. The introduction of Morgan Brody, Ecklie's daughter, Langston having the law put HIM under a hot light. We also met Haskell's father Arvin Thorpe. In the Season Finale IN A DARK, DARK HOUSE, we learn Haskell's real name was Werner Thorpe, we learn young Thorpe killed a door-to-door salesman named Douglas Nathan Haskell & Thorpe assumed Haskell's identity. What made Werner Thorpe Nathan Haskell was revealed. NEED I SAY MORE?! All this went into Season 11 & only 2 episodes got commentary. How can they justify charging the exorbitant price for the DVDs yet still since Season 8, barely phone in the content? Seasons 1 to 11 of THE SIMPSON'S, the seasons that aired BEFORE C.S.I. premiered, have commentary on EVERY episode. 13 in Season 1, 220 on the others. THE SIMPSONS pre-C.S.I. have commentary on a staggering 233 episodes, C.S.I. is in the dust with 48-counting Special Features relevant to a particular episode. THE SIMPSONS on those seasons alone have over 5 times as much commentary.",1,THE TOO MANY DISAPPOINTMENTS,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",2013,5039,"['First', 'want', 'record', 'have', 'nothing', 'contempt',

1359644,A3TM66F5GG21EJ,B003R0MEZO,J. Jessup,"[16, 23]","Preposterous plot lines and hackneyed writing has taken this once great series and fed it to the sharks.And Fonzie is strapping on his waterskis getting ready for the jump.Plots include: Vindictive killer contortionists in latex onesies hiding under beds? JUSTIN BIEBER? Shackled women on all fours acting like cats? And a serial killer sending Ray a kidney bean in the mail? Come on...REALLY?The writing is atrocious, they are giving the cast such absurd one liners that even Henny Youngman would be barfing in the nearest corner. (E.G. Catherine walking by the industrial shredder saying ""well I wouldn't wanna fall into that"" Or Nick commenting on some drunk women who threw a guy over a hotel railing ""A friend will help you move, but a good friend will help you move a body"" NYUK NYUK.) Just awful and insipid writing that is totally contrary to the original CSI creative ethosThe most frustrating aspect of season 11 is that it has sacrificed the science in favor of a level of violence so abhorrent it actually crosses into torture porn. The science USED to tell the story of what happened with minimal flashbacks and just the right amount of special effects. Now the science is packed on the hideous back of the violence with such ridiculously over the top effects and repetitive bloody and violent flashbacks that the viewer is left to feel violated and in need of a shower. It takes pandering to a level even gutters can't compete with. This is especially apparent in an episode featuring a victim who is force fed clam chowder made with his own severed ear and sprinkled with shards of shredded credit cards. The episode with the kidnapping and torture of Rays wife was also repellant and gratuitous. When will Hollywood pull its head out of its backside and stop offering rape as entertainment?This season also shows a gruesome suicide by hanging that will induce nausea in anyone who has maintained even a modicum of sentience.  On the subject of sentience, the episode about hoarding was especially lacking in it. It was offensive and demeaning and was the one episode in this particular season that made my heart ache for the loss of Grissoms humane, empathetic, compassionate AND INFORMED presence.Grissoms abscence is agonizing still but there are two cast members whose radiant and exceptional performances are what made Season 11 bearable in some respects. Paul Guilfoyle as Jim Brass is the anchor, the rock, the hero. He is a solid presence and lends some much needed credibility to CSI. Super Dave (David Berman) is another highlight who brings a special soothing light to a show that seems to be getting darker and darker with every passing season.To the producers please bring back the science. You made it sexy once and you can surely do it again. And science is nothing without the scientists...the HUMANS behind it. The best episodes are the ones that employ both in equal measure with the special effects used only to enhance the science not upstage it. The scientists were where the original humanity of this show emanated from, please don't forget the humanity.",2,Sacrificing the science on the altar of gratuitous torture porn,1317340800,"09 30, 2011",2011,3091,"['Preposterous', 'plot', 'lines', 'hackneyed', 'writing', 'taken', 'once', 'great', 'series', 'fed', 'sharks.And', 'Fonzie', 'strapping', 'waterskis', 'getting', 'ready', 'jump.Plots', 'include', 'Vindictive', 'killer', 'contortionists', 'latex', 'onesies', 'hiding', 'beds', 'JUSTIN', 'BIEBER', 'Shackled', 'women', 'fours', 'acting', 'cats', 'serial', 'killer', 'sending', 'Ray', 'kidney', 'bean', 'mail', 'Come', 'REALLY', 'writing', 'atrocious', 'are', 'giving', 'cast', 'such', 'absurd', 'one', 'even', 'Henny', 'Youngman', 'would', 'be', 'barfing', 'nearest', 'corner', 'E.G', 'Catherine', 'walking', 'industrial', 'shredder', 'saying', 'well', 'would', ""n't"", 'wan', 'fall', 'Nick', 'commenting', 'drunk', 'women', 'who', 'threw', 'guy', 'hotel', 'railing', 'friend', 'will', 'help', 'move', 'good', 'friend', 'will', 'help', 'move', 'body', 'NYUK', 'NYUK', 'Just', 'awful', 'insipid', 'writing', 'totally', 'contrary', 'original', 'CSI', 'creative', 'ethosThe', 'most', 'frustrating', 'aspect', 'season', '11', 'sacrificed', 'science', 'favor', 'level', 'violence', 'so', 'abhorrent', 'actually', 'torture', 'porn', 'science', 'USED', 'tell', 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'minimal', 'flashbacks', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'special', 'effects', 'Now', 'science', 'packed', 'hideous', 'back', 'violence', 'such', 'ridiculously', 'top', 'effects', 'repetitive', 'bloody', 'violent', 'flashbacks', 'viewer', 'left', 'feel', 'violated', 'need', 'shower', 'pandering', 'level', 'even', 'gutters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compete', 'especially', 'apparent', 'episode', 'featuring', 'victim', 'who', 'force', 'fed', 'clam', 'chowder', 'made', 'own', 'severed', 'ear', 'sprinkled', 'shards', 'shredded', 'credit', 'cards', 'episode', 'kidnapping', 'torture', 'Rays', 'wife', 'was', 'also', 'repellant', 'gratuitous', 'When', 'will', 'Hollywood', 'pull', 'head', 'backside', 'stop', 'offering', 'rape', 'entertainment', 'season', 'also', 'gruesome', 'suicide', 'hanging', 'will', 'induce', 'nausea', 'anyone', 'who', 'maintained', 'even', 'modicum', 'sentience', 'subject', 'sentience', 'episode', 'hoarding', 'was', 'especially', 'lacking', 'was', 'offensive', 'demeaning', 'was', 'one', 'episode', 'particular', 'season', 'made', 'heart', 'ache', 'loss', 'Grissoms', 'humane', 'empathetic', 'compassionate', 'AND', 'INFORMED', 'presence.Grissoms', 'abscence', 'agonizing', 'still', 'are', 'two', 'cast', 'members', 'radiant', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'are', 'what', 'made', 'Season', '11', 'bearable', 'respects', 'Paul', 'Guilfoyle', 'Jim', 'Brass', 'anchor', 'rock', 'hero', 'solid', 'presence', 'much', 'needed', 'credibility', 'CSI', 'Super', 'Dave', 'David', 'Berman', 'highlight', 'who', 'special', 'soothing', 'light', 'show', 'be', 'getting', 'darker', 'darker', 'passing', 'producers', 'please', 'bring', 'back', 'science', 'made', 'once', 'can', 'surely', 'do', 'again', 'science', 'nothing', 'scientists', 'HUMANS', 'best', 'episodes', 'are', 'ones', 'employ', 'equal', 'measure', 'special', 'effects', 'used', 'only', 'enhance', 'science', 'not', 'upstage', 'scientists', 'were', 'where', 'original', 'humanity', 'show', 'emanated', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'humanity']",CSI: Crime Scene Investigation - Season 11

I mean come on not only do you need good episodes to keep up the ratings but a good storyline for the season,  and with season 11 we had that partially with the Haskel storyline for at least half the season with less then favorable smaller storyplots mixed in(Squeeegel).  The other problem I felt with the season was the rest of the cast while some are still enjoyable to watch others have become annoying to down right irritating to watch the foremost being the characters of Catherine Willows and Sara Siddle if these two actresses left the show I highly doubt the ratings would even drop especially since the actress Jorga Fox did her little leave the show and come back for awhile in season 8 and 9 and then her for return and season 10.  While I missed the character and actor for Grissom I still felt that Laurence Fishburne's character could have brought continue new life to the series if the producers allowed it but hey that's Hollywood for you,  now after seeing the start of season 12 I'm truly annoyed as we have Ted Danson in the show and his character was so poorly tuned in just the first episode I couldn't even bother watching the rest of the episode.
