1598916,A2YH3YTPSCAWF9,B009M4KTH4,"Anthony Marinelli ""marilread""","[3, 6]","Jerry in his last Columbia film, and I dont know if he new it would be his last perhaps wss looking for a comedy with something different to it, and he assembled one of the best directors of old hollywood George Marshall in a fable unusual for him overtly chaplinesque. Perhaps he saw that quality in it, so he decided its not a film he should direct, and increasingly the studio didnt like his direction. Who knows? Given the storyline and dialogue its a film best left in other hands, although occasionally as in the heart attack scene his spontaneity breaks free from the director's reign as it does elsewhere. It's a spanish type tell, of the deeper nature of life, what society is beneath the surface level, what people for the most part are actually like? FRom 1050-65 Lewis worked for Paramount, and he increasingly had trouble getting his films approved, Boeing Boeing(1965) was a flop but it was aimed at a more adult audience, and he wanted to do a european story Three on a Couch a send up of the comedy profession with several comic impersonations thrown in, and Paramount wouldnt back it..he left and found Columbia with big promotion and publicity backing the project. It did well and found an audience, but no one really thought much of it, and this was his last film for Columbia, since he wanted to direct and do certain films, or who knows the actual story...the film opens as a narrative framing device and is told in flashbacks..a group of spanish doctors and nurses assembled to hear his tale of america..a town anyways in suburbia..a person suffering from the symptoms of the seven year inch..claustrophobic home environment..in which he seems out of place..the children and wife, seem indifferent and there seems to be no love or emotions everyone goes through the motions waiting for the end of day. He eventually sees a doctor, the honored profession, who tells him he has a heart ailment and will die in 6 months, and on his wife's advice, decided to charge his credit cards and die vacationing knowing he'll never pay it back? Not that he would enjoy the home environment..he visits a series of spanish vacation spots and like home, is largely alone, spends his time fishing or wandering, but we never see him emotionally involved with anyone which is how the film ends. A view of the modern suburbab life, glum satire, I enjoyed it..and of course at film's end the doctor tells him he's ok..he's saddled with debts must fake a death and escape..and discovers his doctor and wife betray him, and the doctor is also his best friend, secret lovers, and the children are robots under mom's control..he's alone but was he ever anything else, and who in this world is emotionally relating to anyone?..It is a jerry lewis comedy..there are some comic sequences of note..at the beginning there are a series of comic scenes, with flowers, later with asink, and a few more...and they are reminiscent of three stooges shorts stunts, and it suits the film and is quite in context. There are more scenes throughout, but Lewis is often not constrained and the slapstick is different through his comic mannerisms, even with the best of directors. The beginning slapsticks with the outdoor scenes are the best of the bunch, well done and carried out, and the kid in one scene adds a great touch in the sink scene. Is suburban life all betrayal out manipulating each other for their own ends? I found it a fitting end to Lewis' Paramount-columbia years, and he says he found some growth, but he leaves to others to judge..the next year he filmed Which way to the front(1970) a war film at Warners. What do I think? It comes off as a comic the theme and pessimism overlays the comedy, although the director tries to inject comic sequences, the frame tells all.and the character's name Fred C Dobbs the same name as the bOgart character in John HUston's Treasure of the Sierra Madre(1948) another spanish type film made in Mexico, one of the great films ever made, with a similar bleak view, a character suffering paranoia the world is against him, or is that what the world actually is? A fitting end to the Columbia films..first time ever offered on Vhs/dvd and they should bring out THree on a couch and Big MOuth...its too bad these chaplinesque films really dont have the talents of a modern comic, sadly john candy was the last with his large frame and jovial manner to play this kind of role..and Peter Sellers..ever see The Party(1968).",4,parable comedy drama of betrayal/solitude,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,4453,"['Jerry', 'last', 'Columbia', 'film', 'dont', 'know', 'new', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'perhaps', 'wss', 'looking', 'comedy', 'something', 'different', 'assembled', 'one', 'best', 'directors', 'old', 'hollywood', 'George', 'Marshall', 'fable', 'unusual', 'overtly', 'chaplinesque', 'Perhaps', 'saw', 'quality', 'decided', 'not', 'film', 'should', 'direct', 'increasingly', 'studio', 'didnt', 'direction', 'Who', 'Given', 'storyline', 'dialogue', 'film', 'best', 'left', 'other', 'hands', 'occasionally', 'heart', 'attack', 'scene', 'spontaneity', 'breaks', 'free', 'director', 'reign', 'elsewhere', 'spanish', 'type', 'tell', 'deeper', 'nature', 'life', 'what', 'society', 'surface', 'level', 'what', 'people', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'actually', '1050-65', 'Lewis', 'worked', 'Paramount', 'increasingly', 'had', 'trouble', 'getting', 'films', 'approved', 'Boeing', 'Boeing', '1965', 'was', 'flop', 'was', 'aimed', 'more', 'adult', 'audience', 'wanted', 'do', 'european', 'story', 'Three', 'Couch', 'send', 'comedy', 'profession', 'several', 'comic', 'impersonations', 'thrown', 'Paramount', 'wouldnt', 'back', 'it..he', 'left', 'found', 'Columbia', 'big', 'promotion', 'publicity', 'backing', 'project', 'did', 'well', 'found', 'audience', 'one', 'really', 'thought', 'much', 'was', 'last', 'film', 'Columbia', 'wanted', 'direct', 'do', 'certain', 'films', 'who', 'actual', 'story', 'film', 'narrative', 'framing', 'device', 'told', 'flashbacks..a', 'group', 'spanish', 'doctors', 'nurses', 'assembled', 'hear', 'tale', 'america..a', 'town', 'anyways', 'suburbia..a', 'person', 'suffering', 'symptoms', 'seven', 'year', 'inch..claustrophobic', 'home', 'environment..in', 'place..the', 'children', 'wife', 'seem', 'indifferent', 'there', 'be', 'love', 'emotions', 'everyone', 'motions', 'waiting', 'end', 'day', 'eventually', 'doctor', 'honored', 'profession', 'who', 'heart', 'ailment', 'will', 'die', '6', 'months', 'wife', 'advice', 'decided', 'charge', 'credit', 'cards', 'die', 'vacationing', 'knowing', ""'ll"", 'never', 'pay', 'back', 'Not', 'would', 'enjoy', 'home', 'environment..he', 'series', 'spanish', 'vacation', 'spots', 'home', 'largely', 'alone', 'time', 'fishing', 'wandering', 'never', 'see', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'anyone', 'how', 'film', 'view', 'modern', 'suburbab', 'life', 'glum', 'satire', 'enjoyed', 'it..and', 'course', 'film', 'end', 'doctor', 'saddled', 'debts', 'must', 'fake', 'death', 'escape..and', 'discovers', 'doctor', 'wife', 'betray', 'doctor', 'also', 'best', 'friend', 'secret', 'lovers', 'children', 'are', 'robots', 'mom', 'control..he', 'alone', 'was', 'ever', 'anything', 'else', 'who', 'world', 'emotionally', 'relating', 'anyone', '..It', 'jerry', 'lewis', 'are', 'comic', 'sequences', 'note..at', 'beginning', 'are', 'series', 'comic', 'scenes', 'flowers', 'later', 'asink', 'few', 'more', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'three', 'stooges', 'stunts', 'suits', 'film', 'quite', 'context', 'are', 'more', 'scenes', 'Lewis', 'often', 'not', 'constrained', 'slapstick', 'different', 'comic', 'mannerisms', 'even', 'best', 'directors', 'beginning', 'slapsticks', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'are', 'best', 'bunch', 'well', 'done', 'carried', 'out', 'kid', 'one', 'scene', 'great', 'touch', 'sink', 'scene', 'suburban', 'life', 'betrayal', 'out', 'manipulating', 'other', 'own', 'ends', 'found', 'fitting', 'end', 'Lewis', 'Paramount-columbia', 'years', 'found', 'growth', 'others', 'judge..the', 'next', 'year', 'filmed', 'Which', 'way', 'front', '1970', 'war', 'film', 'Warners', 'What', 'do', 'think', 'off', 'comic', 'theme', 'pessimism', 'comedy', 'director', 'inject', 'comic', 'sequences', 'frame', 'all.and', 'character', 'name', 'Fred', 'C', 'Dobbs', 'same', 'name', 'bOgart', 'character', 'John', 'HUston', 'Treasure', 'Sierra', 'Madre', '1948', 'spanish', 'type', 'film', 'made', 'Mexico', 'one', 'great', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'similar', 'bleak', 'view', 'character', 'suffering', 'world', 'what', 'world', 'actually', 'fitting', 'end', 'Columbia', 'films..first', 'time', 'ever', 'offered', 'Vhs/dvd', 'should', 'bring', 'out', 'THree', 'couch', 'Big', 'MOuth', 'too', 'bad', 'chaplinesque', 'films', 'really', 'dont', 'have', 'talents', 'modern', 'comic', 'sadly', 'john', 'candy', 'was', 'last', 'large', 'frame', 'jovial', 'manner', 'play', 'kind', 'role..and', 'Peter', 'Sellers..ever', 'see', 'Party', '1968']",N/A
1598917,A318U9EEQT118G,B009M4KTH4,"DLT ""Classic_Movie_Fan""","[11, 11]","HOOK, LINE & SINKER has a terrible reputation.  Some critics such as Leonard Maltin in his MOVIE GUIDE call the film a bomb.  I don't agree.  While it's not prime Jerry it's certainly better, imo, than some of his other late 60's titles such as WAY WAY OUT! & DON'T RAISE THE BRIDGE, LOWER THE RIVER.  Like those other Lewis films this is not a film directed by Lewis himself, but rather by old Hollywood hand George Marshall, whose career went back to the silent days, and whose final feature film this would be.There is a good plot in this film.  Lewis' doctor (Peter Lawford) tells Jerry that he has a heart condition and limited time left, his wife (the beautiful Anne Francis) tells him he should make the most of the time that is left and enjoy his final days doing what he loves--fishing--in exotic locales using only the best equipment on chartered boats, etc.  It will cost a fortune--of course Lewis doesn't have that kind of money, but his wife tells him to put it all on credit cards and not worry about the bills--his insurance will pay for it when he croaks.  The trouble is that it's all a set-up and Lewis is not dying and the doctor and wife are in cahoots.There are some good sight gags in the film--a wild dance by a drunken Jerry and an amusing scene where he breaks into a morgue by coming thru a window and attempting to light a candle.  That is all vintage stuff, but for a lot of the picture it's a  black comedy which Lewis plays fairly straight and allows others to shine--such as the always terrific Kathleen Freeman playing baby sitter to Lewis and Francis's children.This film (released by Columbia) was released 20 years after the first Jerry Lewis film, MY FRIEND IRMA.  For 15 of those 20 years, Lewis was a top box office star both with his partner Dean Martin and individually from 1957-1964 in a string of classic comedies most directed by Lewis and his mentor, Frank Tashlin.  After 1964, the quality of Lewis's films fell off and slowly so did his box office potency.  After HOOK LINE & SINKER, Lewis would complete only two more films--before taking a long sabbatical from pictures. Part of the falling off of his popularity is that after 1964, as Lewis was close to turning 40, he decided he was too old to play 'The Kid' and made an attempt to mature his screen image.  Sometimes it worked (I love BOEING BOEING) and sometimes it fell flat.  HOOK LINE & SINKER, I think, falls somewhere in the middle.",3,One of the better late 60's Lewis Films,1356566400,"12 27, 2012",2012,2441,"['HOOK', 'LINE', 'SINKER', 'terrible', 'reputation', 'critics', 'such', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'MOVIE', 'GUIDE', 'call', 'film', 'bomb', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'not', 'prime', 'Jerry', 'certainly', 'better', 'imo', 'other', 'late', '60', 'titles', 'such', 'WAY', 'WAY', 'OUT', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'RAISE', 'THE', 'BRIDGE', 'LOWER', 'THE', 'RIVER', 'other', 'Lewis', 'films', 'not', 'film', 'directed', 'Lewis', 'rather', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'hand', 'George', 'Marshall', 'career', 'went', 'back', 'silent', 'days', 'final', 'feature', 'film', 'would', 'be.There', 'good', 'plot', 'film', 'Lewis', 'doctor', 'Peter', 'Lawford', 'Jerry', 'heart', 'condition', 'limited', 'time', 'left', 'wife', 'beautiful', 'Anne', 'Francis', 'should', 'make', 'most', 'time', 'left', 'enjoy', 'final', 'days', 'doing', 'what', 'fishing', 'exotic', 'locales', 'using', 'only', 'best', 'equipment', 'chartered', 'boats', 'etc', 'will', 'cost', 'fortune', 'course', 'Lewis', ""n't"", 'have', 'kind', 'money', 'wife', 'put', 'credit', 'cards', 'not', 'worry', 'bills', 'insurance', 'will', 'pay', 'when', 'trouble', 'set-up', 'Lewis', 'not', 'dying', 'doctor', 'wife', 'are', 'cahoots.There', 'are', 'good', 'sight', 'gags', 'film', 'wild', 'dance', 'drunken', 'Jerry', 'amusing', 'scene', 'where', 'morgue', 'coming', 'thru', 'window', 'attempting', 'light', 'candle', 'vintage', 'stuff', 'lot', 'picture', 'black', 'comedy', 'Lewis', 'fairly', 'straight', 'others', 'shine', 'such', 'always', 'terrific', 'Kathleen', 'Freeman', 'playing', 'baby', 'sitter', 'Lewis', 'Francis', 'children.This', 'film', 'released', 'Columbia', 'was', 'released', '20', 'years', 'first', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'film', 'MY', 'FRIEND', 'IRMA', '15', '20', 'years', 'Lewis', 'was', 'top', 'box', 'office', 'star', 'partner', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'individually', '1957-1964', 'string', 'classic', 'comedies', 'most', 'directed', 'Lewis', 'mentor', 'Frank', 'Tashlin', '1964', 'quality', 'Lewis', 'films', 'fell', 'off', 'slowly', 'so', 'did', 'box', 'office', 'potency', 'HOOK', 'LINE', 'SINKER', 'Lewis', 'would', 'complete', 'only', 'two', 'more', 'films', 'taking', 'long', 'sabbatical', 'pictures', 'Part', 'falling', 'popularity', '1964', 'Lewis', 'was', 'close', 'turning', '40', 'decided', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'play', ""'The"", 'Kid', 'made', 'attempt', 'mature', 'screen', 'image', 'worked', 'love', 'BOEING', 'BOEING', 'fell', 'flat', 'HOOK', 'LINE', 'SINKER', 'think', 'somewhere', 'middle']",N/A
