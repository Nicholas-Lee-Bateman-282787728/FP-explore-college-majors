Their transfers show no evidence of restoration, so quality varies from one title to the next, with ""fair to good"" being the average.British-made THE AMAZING ADVENTURE (originally ""The Amazing Quest of Ernest Bliss"") features a low-key Cary Grant at the top of his game as an indolent son of wealth who attempts to earn his physician's respect by betting he can forsake family riches and comfort and make his way in the world for a year, starting with only a small wardrobe and 5 in his pocket.In this typical mid-Depression Era romantic comedy, uppercrust Bliss gets an education in how the working class lives. Along the way he also finds compassion for his fellow creature, becomes a better man himself, falls in love with a real sweety (Miss Brian) and wins his wager with the doctor.It's another take onMY MAN GODFREY(1936) orSULLIVAN'S TRAVELS(1941), and almost a reversal of theFINIAN'S RAINBOWsong, ""When the Idle Poor Become the Idle Rich,"" although here Cary successfully transitions from idle rich to being gainfully employed, as first an appliance salesman and then a chauffeur. It's not a movie classic, but ""The Amazing Adventure"" is pleasant enough, never drags, and is a definite treat for us Archibald Leach devotees.

Buff and fit from his many years as a vaudeville acrobat, singer and dancer, Mr. Grant returned to his native England from his new home in the US to make it.  He loved the script - it was a welcome departure from the dark films he had made in in the '20s and early 30's. It also led to his being cast in later American-made films where he played the ""good guy"" that helps others, which is very much the man he really was.  The rest of the cast is largely unknown to modern American audiences although Mary Brian was one of the few who successfully made the transition from silent films to talkies.

493464,A22F3BWM7RAHDA,B000006BQD,P. B. Sharp,"[1, 1]","The scene is London, 1937. A very young Cary Grant is  a wealthy man who has never worked in his life, and who temporarily puts his riches on hold while seeking fulfillment by becoming one of the working class. Feeling unwell, he had paid a visit to a Harley Street doctor, who diagnosed Grant's problem as ennui due to too much money and easy living and who bet him 50,000 pounds he would not be able to join the working class for an entire year, living on a vastly reduced income. Having been disenchanted with his  monied life, Cary Grant readily accepts the bet. His character, Ernest Bliss is ironic, for Ernest is by no means blissful but could be said to be earnest.Although this is a delightful film Cary Grant in no way resembles a common laborer or salesman. Even when selling stoves he is debonaire, dressed in tweedy sports suits that  no ordinary salesman could afford. He learns a lesson to be sure, that  money is not necessary for happiness and through this  adventure he witnesses poverty, sadness, greed, the gamut of human emotions that he had never experienced. Of course he meets a girl, played competently by Mary Brian who  is a humble secretary. Grant  in his search for happiness  witnesses the things that really matter in life- loyalty, kindness, love,  even vulnerability and contentment with what you have. And above all, the ability to be happy.Some of the scenes and items in this long ago movie will astonish a modern audience, such as the primitive-looking stove Grant is obliged to hawk. I don't recall Grant smoking cigarettes in any movie of his I have seen and he puffs away until embarked on his adventure for enlightenment. The movie is only about an hour long and comes close to being corny. But it's Grant who carries it along. His very presence  guarantees satisfaction, satisfaction with  the man who more or less invented himself.

Ernest Bliss (Cary Grant) temporarily gives up his riches to become working poor to understand his apparent illness, and seek enlightenment. He rents an apartment in from an old lady who is compassionate and understanding. He works for a limousine service company as a driver where he meets a caring worker. He falls in love with a young woman named Frances Clayton (Mary Brian), and learns a crucial thing in life; to be in love, the lady doesn't have to be beautiful or wealthy, but all heart will do. During his adventure; he sees life, people, poverty, suffering, and sadness. He understands that people in spite of all uncertainties in life find happiness with what they have, and they care about another human being. He gradually realizes that his wealth is an obstacle in pursuit of happiness and to have peace in eternal life. Cary Grant has performed brilliantly with his usual caliber and charm, but I was impressed most with the performance of Mary Brian, who is loving, yet so vulnerable in life.

The claims I hear most are that there isn't enough action, there are no special effects, and the plots are boring. Many of those same complaints can be made about modern movies as well. The biggest difference is that you can't take your whole family to see those films because of all the swearing, violence, and sex whereas a family can enjoy watcing an old film together without any worry of having to blind the youngsters eyes and cover their ears.AMAZING ADVENTURE is not a great movie; it's just the usual run of the mill love story. However, there is one exception that makes the movie a par above the rest: Cary Grant. I have yet to see a bad movie in which he acted. Not only that, but Grant had the rare ability to take even the most mudane movie moments and transform them into cinematic magic. Such is the case with AMAZING ADVENTURE.

The doctor tells him that he is physically fit, but is affected by the disease of money.

The plot was predictable, the sound was sometimes difficult to distinguish, and it was often unrealistic. However, I still enjoyed watching it, mostly to see a bit of the 1930s, with the cars, clothes, and styles. It has a great fight scene that is so staged it's fantastic. For under $10, if you like old movies, this one is worth seeing.",3,A movie of its time,1213401600,"06 14, 2008",2008,389,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'plot', 'was', 'predictable', 'sound', 'was', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'distinguish', 'was', 'often', 'unrealistic', 'However', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'mostly', 'see', 'bit', '1930s', 'cars', 'clothes', 'styles', 'great', 'fight', 'scene', 'so', 'staged', 'fantastic', '10', 'like', 'old', 'movies', 'one', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A
