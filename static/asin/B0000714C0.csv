With help from a buddy... will it happen?  You'll have to watch it and see.It's not a particularly interesting storyline or a revolutionary concept by any means, but it's a story that flows in a relatively enjoyable way, and has some decent moments from time to time.The acting skills aren't that great though.  Regardless, it's a passable film that hasn't dated as horribly as some other films released 20 years ago.",3,typical,1279152000,"07 15, 2010",2010,535,"['Mystery', 'Date', 'mystery', 'what', 'storyline', 'about', 'young', 'college', 'kid', 'score', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'help', 'buddy', 'will', 'happen', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'see.It', 'not', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'revolutionary', 'concept', 'means', 'story', 'relatively', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'decent', 'moments', 'time', 'time.The', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'Regardless', 'passable', 'film', ""n't"", 'dated', 'as', 'horribly', 'other', 'films', 'released', '20', 'years', 'ago']",N/A
724091,ABXYDATMH4BB9,B0000714C0,"C. Pollanen ""eino_79""","[7, 7]","&quot;Mystery Date&quot; stars Ethan Hawke (Training Day) and Teri Polo (Meet The Parents) in a great romantic-comedy that is sure to be loved by everyone.  Geena (Polo) stars as the gorgeous neighbour of Tom (Hawke), whom he is completely infatuated with.  Tom tries to get the nerve to ask her out, but fails at every turn.  A surprise visit from his older brother (Brian McNamara) brings a bit of luck Tom's way.  Through a bit of work, Tom's brother sets him up on a date with Geena.  Things couldn't be better, except for the small of exception of a little bit of mistaken identity on the part of Tom.  For some reason, people think he's his older brother.  Over the course of the evening the duo have run-ins with a maniacal flower delivery boy (Fisher Stevens), paid-off cops, a crime lord and other trouble.  Do the two escape alive, or does this spell the end of Tom and Geena?  I highly recommend this movie as the laughs are plenty.  Many people are sure to relate to this romantic-comedy about a first-date.  Ethan and Teri do wonderful jobs in their respective rolls and the movie has got a pretty decent transfer too.  The disc has both widescreen and fullscreen versions of the movie, in addition to the original trailer.

724097,ASF2Z8OJR0TP3,B0000714C0,S. T. Peterson,"[0, 0]","Reminds me of a lesser quality ""Adventures in Babysitting"" mixed with a ""Something About Marry"". I would not say this is a ""romantic comedy"". The dialogue was a little lacking and sometimes just odd. . . maybe it was the timing. For example, one guy is sneaking outside a girl's house. He stops and listens to her answer the telephone, even proceed to tell her mom she didn't go out on a date and why. Then she says ""Wait mom I think I heard something outside"" when he has been sitting outside listening for several minutes not making a sound. The window doesn't even appear to be open but he (and we) hear her as if it is. So then he takes off and of course stumbles across a trashcan making a noise. WTH?? Several things like this happen and just doesn't just make sense. The older brother is neither James Bond nor Don Johnson but kinda in an SNL way acts like a guy who is supposed to be both. There is a dude that looks like Ellen Degeneres who is supposed to be the down on his luck very accident pron guy. He backs out of a driveway while someone is pulling in (in a house he just visited and crashes into him. No reason . . . no explanation of who is pulling in the driveway. I have seen high school plays better than this. The girl is supposed to be clueless like Cameron Diaz's character in Knight and Day. But she would have to be brain dead to not get what was going way before she caught on. And on a lesser note I couldn't tell where this movie was supposed to be set. They ""came up"" from CA. But the parents were ""going to CT"" (driving) for 3 days. I saw in the credits it was actually filmed in Vancouver and they have a bridge that looks like the one in Vancouver. I guess you were supposed to just imagine a lot as it was just a movie. Dunno. I could go on and on with the strangeness (including how Ethan wears way too much make in this movie) but in the end it was entertaining. It keeps moving like ""Adventures in Babysitting"". It races the guy and girl from one city scene to another. They are constantly trying to get out of one jam and another. There are a little more dead bodies and gore than I was expecting, esp for pg13 in 1991. Anyway the girl is the actress in all the Meet My Parents (Ben Stiller) movies. The ""chinese guy"" is the one in ""Shanghai Surprise"". For me this was just another movie I missed (seeing in the theatre and being advertised) back in then.",3,strange premise but entertaining,1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,2393,"['Reminds', 'lesser', 'quality', 'Adventures', 'Babysitting', 'mixed', 'Something', 'About', 'Marry', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'dialogue', 'was', 'little', 'lacking', 'sometimes', 'just', 'odd', 'maybe', 'was', 'timing', 'example', 'one', 'guy', 'sneaking', 'girl', 'house', 'answer', 'telephone', 'even', 'proceed', 'tell', 'mom', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'out', 'date', 'why', 'Then', 'Wait', 'mom', 'think', 'heard', 'something', 'outside', 'when', 'been', 'sitting', 'outside', 'listening', 'several', 'minutes', 'not', 'making', 'sound', 'window', ""n't"", 'even', 'appear', 'be', 'open', 'hear', 'So', 'then', 'course', 'stumbles', 'trashcan', 'making', 'noise', 'WTH', 'Several', 'things', 'happen', 'just', ""n't"", 'just', 'make', 'sense', 'older', 'brother', 'James', 'Bond', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'kinda', 'SNL', 'way', 'acts', 'guy', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'dude', 'Ellen', 'Degeneres', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'down', 'luck', 'very', 'accident', 'pron', 'guy', 'driveway', 'someone', 'pulling', 'house', 'just', 'visited', 'crashes', 'reason', 'explanation', 'who', 'pulling', 'driveway', 'have', 'seen', 'high', 'school', 'plays', 'better', 'girl', 'supposed', 'be', 'clueless', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'character', 'Knight', 'Day', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'brain', 'dead', 'not', 'get', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'way', 'caught', 'lesser', 'note', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'set', 'came', 'up', 'CA', 'parents', 'were', 'going', 'CT', 'driving', '3', 'days', 'saw', 'credits', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'Vancouver', 'have', 'bridge', 'one', 'Vancouver', 'guess', 'were', 'supposed', 'just', 'imagine', 'lot', 'was', 'just', 'movie', 'Dunno', 'could', 'go', 'strangeness', 'including', 'how', 'Ethan', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'make', 'movie', 'end', 'was', 'entertaining', 'moving', 'Adventures', 'Babysitting', 'guy', 'girl', 'one', 'city', 'scene', 'are', 'constantly', 'trying', 'get', 'one', 'jam', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'dead', 'bodies', 'gore', 'was', 'expecting', 'esp', 'pg13', '1991', 'Anyway', 'girl', 'actress', 'Meet', 'My', 'Parents', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'movies', 'chinese', 'guy', 'one', 'Shanghai', 'Surprise', 'was', 'just', 'movie', 'missed', 'seeing', 'theatre', 'being', 'advertised', 'back', 'then']",N/A
