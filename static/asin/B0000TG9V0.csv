783041,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B0000TG9V0,Brett Corkins,"[1, 1]","I had never seen a Pearl Jam concert before viewing this and was wary to buy it. I ended up taking the plunge and rushed home to pop it in. It's way better than I expected. I had always heard Pearl Jam was a band that proved themselves through their performances and I finally understand why. All the songs are performed amazingly, they don't follow the exact version of a few songs like on their CDs but they add something extra to them to make them special. While the footage is pretty raw, you get the general feel of a Pearl Jam concert. You feel the intensity, you see the passion, you can tell they love what they do.Most of their huge hits are played, but Dissident is mysteriously missing. That's the only thing missing from this wonderful collection. Other than that one song, they highlight their career very well. I really liked Gimme Some Truth, I think Ed was particularly intense on this song. I was glad to see Lukin was on here. While it is a very short song, it's a song I felt they played perfectly. The songs where Ben Harper sang were nice, but I would have rather heard Ed alone. He does have a great voice though, so they are worth a listen. The little conversation between some songs is nice, I especially liked the conversation after Do The Evolution (which is definitely one of the best on here). The fact that they're not afraid to play slower songs in concert is also nice, most bands would only play their heaviest, fastest material.Overall this is definitely worth the price. You get a high energy performance by one of the best bands in years. The bonus features are a nice addition as well. This is a performance worthy of DVD viewing and worthy of the infamous Madison Square Garden.",5,Lukin alone is worth it,1115337600,"05 6, 2005",2005,1715,"['had', 'never', 'seen', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'concert', 'viewing', 'was', 'wary', 'buy', 'ended', 'up', 'taking', 'plunge', 'rushed', 'home', 'pop', 'way', 'better', 'expected', 'had', 'always', 'heard', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'was', 'band', 'proved', 'performances', 'finally', 'understand', 'why', 'songs', 'are', 'performed', 'amazingly', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'exact', 'version', 'few', 'songs', 'CDs', 'add', 'something', 'extra', 'make', 'special', 'footage', 'pretty', 'raw', 'get', 'general', 'feel', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'concert', 'feel', 'intensity', 'see', 'passion', 'can', 'tell', 'love', 'what', 'do.Most', 'huge', 'hits', 'are', 'played', 'Dissident', 'mysteriously', 'missing', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'wonderful', 'collection', 'Other', 'one', 'song', 'highlight', 'career', 'very', 'well', 'really', 'liked', 'Gim', 'Truth', 'think', 'Ed', 'was', 'particularly', 'intense', 'song', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'Lukin', 'was', 'here', 'very', 'short', 'song', 'song', 'felt', 'played', 'perfectly', 'songs', 'where', 'Ben', 'Harper', 'sang', 'were', 'nice', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'heard', 'Ed', 'alone', 'have', 'great', 'voice', 'are', 'listen', 'little', 'conversation', 'songs', 'nice', 'especially', 'liked', 'conversation', 'Do', 'Evolution', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'here', 'fact', ""'re"", 'not', 'afraid', 'play', 'slower', 'songs', 'concert', 'also', 'nice', 'most', 'bands', 'would', 'only', 'play', 'heaviest', 'fastest', 'material.Overall', 'definitely', 'worth', 'price', 'get', 'high', 'energy', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'bands', 'years', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'nice', 'addition', 'as', 'well', 'performance', 'worthy', 'DVD', 'viewing', 'worthy', 'infamous', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden']",N/A

783044,A3POLEU6T17739,B0000TG9V0,E. Callaway,"[2, 2]","There have been several Pearl Jam DVD releases in the past few years.  All of them have their respective highlights.  This particular title is the best of the released shows thus far.  Shot in a widescreen format, you get a wide angle on the stage. The first concert DVD (Touring Band 2000) release was shot with a sort of grainy-looking film.  This gave it a warm feel but it was in poor focus at times.  The fact that there were songs from different performances, it gave Pearl Jam the discretion to pick the most solid performances, but it lacked continuity.  This footage, coming from a single show, was great.  I realy do prefer a concert video comprised of one show.The setlist is great.  Mixing new with classic, it moves very quickly. The new music from ""Riot Act"" translates well to the live setting.  The John Lennon cover of ""Gimmie Some Truth"" is especially powerful as Mr. Vedder altered some of the lyrics to be applicable to the Iraq war.  It is no secret that Pearl Jam has taken an antiwar stance when it comes to the subject.  I don't believe in recapping every song, but I will say that highlights include: ""Black,"" ""Save You,"" ""Crazy Mary,"" and the amazing, seldom played ""Breath."" Hearing the crowd sing along with ""Black"" reminded me of when I saw them in 1999 and I looked around at what amounted to more than 10,000 people singing the songs they loved(there were actually 18,000 people there, but I figure not everyone knew the words, but from where I was I could see an ocean of open mouths singing along).  Mentioning those songs does not detract from the fact that the whole of the two DVDs is great.Ben Harper playing on ""Daughter"" and ""Indifference"" was phenomenal.  That man is such a talent.  The special features are a huge selling point for this DVD.  An Ed-only performance of ""Dead Man"" was spectacular.  There was a collage of footage from several different performances of the controversial ""Bu$hleaguer.""  There is also a song that is played over footage of the entire crew who worked on the tour as a ""thank you"" to them.  It has always been touching how they always have made sure to include these people as part of the ""family.""Overall this is the best DVD released thus far.  The band is strong and the mix of the audio is superb.  I can't wait to see what's next for what has amounted as one of the most prolific bands of their era.epc",5,If I could give it another star. . .,1074556800,"01 20, 2004",2004,2378,"['have', 'been', 'several', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'DVD', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'respective', 'highlights', 'particular', 'title', 'best', 'released', 'shows', 'thus', 'far', 'Shot', 'widescreen', 'format', 'get', 'wide', 'angle', 'stage', 'first', 'concert', 'DVD', 'Touring', 'Band', '2000', 'release', 'was', 'shot', 'sort', 'grainy-looking', 'film', 'gave', 'warm', 'feel', 'was', 'poor', 'focus', 'times', 'fact', 'were', 'songs', 'different', 'performances', 'gave', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'discretion', 'pick', 'most', 'solid', 'performances', 'lacked', 'continuity', 'footage', 'coming', 'single', 'show', 'was', 'great', 'realy', 'do', 'prefer', 'concert', 'video', 'comprised', 'one', 'show.The', 'setlist', 'great', 'Mixing', 'new', 'classic', 'very', 'quickly', 'new', 'music', 'Riot', 'Act', 'well', 'live', 'setting', 'John', 'Lennon', 'cover', 'Gimmie', 'Truth', 'especially', 'powerful', 'Mr.', 'Vedder', 'altered', 'lyrics', 'be', 'applicable', 'Iraq', 'war', 'secret', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'taken', 'antiwar', 'stance', 'when', 'subject', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'recapping', 'song', 'will', 'say', 'highlights', 'include', 'Black', 'Save', 'Crazy', 'Mary', 'amazing', 'seldom', 'played', 'Breath', 'Hearing', 'crowd', 'sing', 'Black', 'reminded', 'when', 'saw', '1999', 'looked', 'around', 'what', 'amounted', 'more', '10,000', 'people', 'singing', 'songs', 'loved', 'were', 'actually', '18,000', 'people', 'there', 'figure', 'not', 'everyone', 'knew', 'words', 'where', 'was', 'could', 'see', 'ocean', 'open', 'mouths', 'singing', 'along', 'Mentioning', 'songs', 'not', 'detract', 'fact', 'whole', 'two', 'DVDs', 'great.Ben', 'Harper', 'playing', 'Daughter', 'Indifference', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'man', 'such', 'talent', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'huge', 'selling', 'point', 'DVD', 'Ed-only', 'performance', 'Dead', 'Man', 'was', 'spectacular', 'was', 'collage', 'footage', 'several', 'different', 'performances', 'controversial', 'Bu', 'hleaguer', 'also', 'song', 'played', 'footage', 'entire', 'crew', 'who', 'worked', 'tour', 'thank', 'always', 'been', 'touching', 'how', 'always', 'have', 'made', 'sure', 'include', 'people', 'part', 'family', 'Overall', 'best', 'DVD', 'released', 'thus', 'far', 'band', 'strong', 'mix', 'audio', 'superb', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'what', 'amounted', 'one', 'most', 'prolific', 'bands', 'era.epc']",N/A

783047,AENRHAKDM5GMP,B0000TG9V0,"J. Lockridge ""jllx""","[8, 11]","Now, THIS is a rock n' roll show from Rock's ""good guys"". Pearl Jam is probably the most important band ever in American music. They are to the US what Led Zeppelin was to Britain. This concert is a fantastic representation of their mature post-millenium shows. No, you won't see a lot of crowd-surfing or moshing any more from these 30 and 40 somethings, just a LOT of great music, and wonderful lyrics. Mike McCready is quite possibly one of the world's most underrated, soulful guitarists, and his playing just sounds even better when you can see what those fingers are doing. At first, I was not a fan of adding Boom Gaspar to the shows, but I have come to quite enjoy his contributions and pretty much consider him a bona fide member of the band, as I do Matt Cameron, who filled in a ""revolving throne"" back when Jack Irons left due to back problems after ""Yield"".There are some true gems on this recording, and the concert goes on and on with LOTS of music and a nice long encore. The crowd is in the thing from the beginning, and the band is ""on"" and every member is in their 'zone', and seems to be having a fantastic time...only Cameron, true to form, seems a bit ""stoic"". Highlights of this DVD are ""Lukin"", ""Black"", ""Thumbing my Way"", ""Last Exit"", and ""Save You""; however, the band just goes to a heavenly plane with ""Low light"", ""Faithful"", and ""In My Tree"". There ain't much from versus and 10 on this one, with the band more oriented towards their more ""organic"", ""laid-back"", and ""vibey"" post-Vitalogy feel, which has turned off some of the ""hard rocking"" PJ fans; however, if you listen back, PJ has always had the pensive, laid back rockers, even in the explosive days of the early 90's with songs like ""Black"", ""Daughter"", ""Alive"", ""Oceans"" and the like. Just because the band has chosen to explore other instruments and rhythms and to mature as a complete organism has caused some to reject them because they don't rock ""hard enough""...And that is ridiculous, as one will see on these DVD's. This is the best representation of PJ's wonderful live shows on ""official"" record. Ben Harper makes a wonderful appearance or two, as does Tony Barber, the Bass player for the Buzzcocks, who is forever immortalized on DVD for not knowing the bassline for ""Sonic Reducer""...Overall, the performance is just about as tight as a live performance gets, and the camera angles and picture quality is pretty good most of the time. The extras are good, but Ed's solo guitar version of ""Dead Man"" stands out as a heartfelt, amazing performance. ""Down"", an underrated song from the B-side record, ""LOst Dogs"", is merely a backdrop for some behind-the-scenes footage, which is fine, but I'd much rather HEAR what the boys are saying, and see a LIVE performance of the song...If you're a fan of Rock and Roll or Pearl Jam, you already own this DVD. If you're just now waking up from your coma, then get this NOW! Study it, learn the methods of PJ, and you, too, can become the best band in America!

783048,A316COGDOL9D1L,B0000TG9V0,"Kenbilt ""PJFAN4EVER""","[1, 1]","I thought ""Touring Band 2000"" was good, but this is so awesome that words simply can't describe it. I was a bit reluctant to ask for it for Christmas '03 at first because I wasn't sure how many ""repeated"" songs were on it from ""TB2000"". But to my pleasure, the only repeats (and they were actually even better) were ""Grievance"", ""Even Flow"", ""Lukin"", ""Daughter"", ""Better Man"", ""Rearviewmirror"", ""Wishlist"", and ""Do The Evolution"". All the rest are other mind-blowing tracks from all of their epic albums from ""Ten"" to ""Lost Dogs"". This concert was during their ""Riot Act"" tour, so there are fortunately a lot of songs from that awesome album. If you liked their latest material, you'll absolutely love this DVD. They also performed several other impressive numbers that have never been filmed before, such as ""In My Tree"", ""Breath"", ""Yellow Ledbetter"", ""Low Light"", and ""Indifference"" to name a few. However, in my opinion, the ONE song performance that was icing on the cake was the emotionally POWERFUL and one of my all time favorites, ""Black"". WOW!!! Words can't describe what seeing that segment does for me. Simply Beautiful!! PJ also performs a few really good covers, like ""Gimme Some Truth"", ""Crown of Thorns"", ""Crazy Mary"", ""Sonic Reducer"", and ""Baba O' Riley"". They all show PJ's umatched talent of covering songs, and they flow nicely with the bands original material. They also had newcomer organ player from Hawaii, Boom Gaspar, who really knows how to play. But for some reason the crowd doesn't seem to like him a whole lot- you'll see how when you watch and listen. I'm not sure why- his touch on the organ seems to flow nicely with PJ's unique blend of music. As for all the players, this concert really showcases their talent. Jeff Ament is incredible with bass, Mike Mccready demonstrates why he is becoming a legendary lead guitarist; he just closes his eyes and looks ups and envelopes himself in the ""zone"", Stone Gossard works his guitar with ease and his talent on shaping and writing songs is evident in a few numbers, Matt Cameron is simply a phenominal drummer who is truly a pleasure to watch, and ofcourse you have our main man Eddie with his unstoppable voice that I can never get tired of. Musician and big fan, Ben Harper, also shows up on ""Daughter"" and ""Indifference"" and offers his vocal ability, and also states  THE truth of truths, that ""Pearl Jam is the GREATEST band in the WORLD"". The Bonus Features on this set are to die for; ""Throw Your Arms Around Me"" with actual writer Mark Seymour is truly a treat to watch and listen to, as is ""Dead Man"", an Eddie Vedder accoustic solo that also appears on ""Lost Dogs"". ""Bushleaguer"" is entertaining to watch as the band makes fun of Bush, ""Fortunate Son"" is a fun little cover with clips of ""Heart"" and other groups playing on stage alongside PJ, ""Down"" is an up-beat number that didn't make ""Riot Act"", and ""All Those Yesterdays"" closes the Bonus features as it did with ""Yield"", showing clips of the band and crew on the road. Ending the actual concert is ofcourse, ""Yellow Ledbetter"", which has sort of become a traditional concert closer. I was so happy with this this 2-DVD set that I couldn't get enough of it.

783049,A1S5B32WYMEE44,B0000TG9V0,"M. Swinney ""Marc My Words""","[31, 33]","The DVD is a small window to the band holding the Rock and Roll Torch on one night.  A window to a tour of a band at its peak...can they get better?The members of Pearl Jam truly love music and it shows.  They wear their influences on their sleeves, The Who, The Ramones, The Buzzcocks, Iron Maiden (McCready), and it shows in their genuine wish to put on a good performance worth the money of a concert ticket.  The night filmed at Madison Square Garden in NYC may not have been their highlight concert from 2003's Riot Act tour but it's a cross-section of one night with the band.  And if you are a fan and happened to miss PJ on that tour, it's one way to be a part of what happened.Boom Gaspar is a benefit added addition to the PJ 5 and truly elevates Crazy Mary with an inspired Hammond Organ romp.  Though Eddie is in the spotlight, each band member contributes and the camera spends isn't mono-mano focused on Ed the whole time.  It's the little things you get to see in concert recordings that make the DVD worth the price of admission.  Mike McCready loses himself from time to time becoming some alter-ego guitar god.  You can tell when it happens because his eyes are closed head faced upwards, in the zone.  His guitar playing becomes otherworldly wicked.  The man can play.  The DVD reveals each member has his talents...Jeff Ament has the groove and energy, Stone Gossard has a knack for songcraft (though his guitar skills are better left providing rhythm and not lead), Matt Cameron has a precise straightforward drumming style (and gifted musically evidenced by his song You Are), Eddie is truly gifted, but Mike McCready elevates the band above just another good Rock and Roll outfit.  The free-flow jam on &quot;Even Flow,&quot; is always good but this night stands out.  Each band member plays off the other and Stone Gossard give McCready room to soar.  Other guitarist maybe more technical, other guitarist may be more speedy, other guitarist may have more individual style, but McCready truly adds soul to all elements of his playing.  It's truly a notch above in Rearviewmirror, Crown of Thorns, Yellow Ledbetter...how he plays the keyboard part of Baba O'Riley will boggle the mind...in fact I would dub it mind-boggling.There are fun extras here watching Eddie ape Bush in Bushleaguer, a &quot;Fortunate Son,&quot; montage of all the bands PJ played with in the Riot Act tour, a wonderfully talented solo performance of Eddie's Dead Man (get Lost Dogs for the studio version).  Pearl Jam has lasting power and outlived the hype of the &quot;grunge&quot; movement in the early 90's.  Other bands that got caught up in the overwhelming pressure of popularity that movement caused either aren't around anymore or aren't relevant.  This Disc captures a band that has stayed true to its roots and true to the music.  Don't miss a concert in your very own living room with one of the best bands playing today in their prime.",5,I Got a Spot at Lukin's,1083974400,"05 8, 2004",2004,2945,"['DVD', 'small', 'window', 'band', 'holding', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Torch', 'one', 'night', 'window', 'tour', 'band', 'peak', 'can', 'get', 'better', 'members', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'truly', 'love', 'music', 'wear', 'influences', 'sleeves', 'Who', 'Ramones', 'Buzzcocks', 'Iron', 'Maiden', 'McCready', 'genuine', 'wish', 'put', 'good', 'performance', 'money', 'concert', 'ticket', 'night', 'filmed', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'NYC', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'highlight', 'concert', '2003', 'Riot', 'Act', 'tour', 'cross-section', 'one', 'night', 'band', 'are', 'fan', 'happened', 'miss', 'PJ', 'tour', 'one', 'way', 'be', 'part', 'what', 'happened.Boom', 'Gaspar', 'benefit', 'added', 'addition', 'PJ', '5', 'truly', 'Crazy', 'Mary', 'inspired', 'Hammond', 'Organ', 'romp', 'Eddie', 'spotlight', 'band', 'member', 'contributes', 'camera', ""n't"", 'mono-mano', 'focused', 'Ed', 'whole', 'time', 'little', 'things', 'get', 'see', 'concert', 'recordings', 'make', 'DVD', 'price', 'admission', 'Mike', 'McCready', 'time', 'time', 'becoming', 'alter-ego', 'guitar', 'god', 'can', 'tell', 'when', 'eyes', 'are', 'closed', 'head', 'faced', 'upwards', 'zone', 'guitar', 'playing', 'otherworldly', 'wicked', 'man', 'can', 'play', 'DVD', 'reveals', 'member', 'talents', 'Jeff', 'Ament', 'groove', 'energy', 'Stone', 'Gossard', 'knack', 'songcraft', 'guitar', 'skills', 'are', 'better', 'left', 'providing', 'rhythm', 'not', 'lead', 'Matt', 'Cameron', 'precise', 'straightforward', 'drumming', 'style', 'gifted', 'musically', 'evidenced', 'song', 'Are', 'Eddie', 'truly', 'gifted', 'Mike', 'McCready', 'band', 'just', 'good', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'outfit', 'free-flow', 'jam', 'quot', 'Even', 'Flow', 'quot', 'always', 'good', 'night', 'out', 'band', 'member', 'other', 'Stone', 'Gossard', 'give', 'McCready', 'room', 'soar', 'Other', 'guitarist', 'maybe', 'more', 'technical', 'other', 'guitarist', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'speedy', 'other', 'guitarist', 'may', 'have', 'more', 'individual', 'style', 'McCready', 'truly', 'soul', 'elements', 'playing', 'truly', 'notch', 'Rearviewmirror', 'Crown', 'Thorns', 'Yellow', 'Ledbetter', 'how', 'keyboard', 'part', 'Baba', ""O'Riley"", 'will', 'boggle', 'mind', 'fact', 'would', 'dub', 'mind-boggling.There', 'are', 'fun', 'extras', 'here', 'watching', 'Eddie', 'ape', 'Bush', 'Bushleaguer', 'quot', 'Fortunate', 'Son', 'quot', 'montage', 'bands', 'PJ', 'played', 'Riot', 'Act', 'tour', 'wonderfully', 'talented', 'solo', 'performance', 'Eddie', 'Dead', 'Man', 'get', 'Lost', 'Dogs', 'studio', 'version', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'lasting', 'power', 'outlived', 'hype', 'quot', 'grunge', 'quot', 'movement', 'early', '90', 'Other', 'bands', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'overwhelming', 'pressure', 'popularity', 'movement', 'caused', 'are', ""n't"", 'anymore', 'are', ""n't"", 'relevant', 'Disc', 'band', 'stayed', 'true', 'roots', 'true', 'music', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'concert', 'very', 'own', 'living', 'room', 'one', 'best', 'bands', 'playing', 'today', 'prime']",N/A

783051,A3KKPVZ2EQQLAB,B0000TG9V0,The archduke,"[0, 0]","Pearl Jam has become one of the more mysterious bands, managing to transform their image and music to fit with their personal growth. The lone suvivors of the grunge era, the Seattle boys put their musical might on the line with this new DVD, and they come through with flying colours. For those who are still obsessed with &quot;Ten&quot;, this concert may not be for you, as they only play two songs from that album, but it is their songs from &quot;Riot Act&quot; that really give this show substance. I can see Pearl Jam drifting towards becoming a real jam band live, and they are able to pull it off. Ben Harper makes a couple of appearances, making a statement as he sang at the extended end of &quot;Daughter&quot;. Eddie Vedder is still blessed with one of the great voices in rock, and there are a few songs here that make this a worthwhile purchase on their own: &quot;Black&quot;, the classic song from &quot;Ten&quot;, a heart-achingly great version of &quot;Betterman&quot;, &quot;I am Mine&quot;, the Who's &quot;Baba O'Reilly&quot; and an extended version of &quot;Rearviewmirror&quot;.Hopefully this band will be around for a long time, because I enjoy the direction they are taking, and their music is something rare: meaningful.",4,One awesome concert,1070064000,"11 29, 2003",2003,1247,"['Pearl', 'Jam', 'become', 'one', 'more', 'mysterious', 'bands', 'managing', 'transform', 'image', 'music', 'fit', 'personal', 'growth', 'lone', 'suvivors', 'grunge', 'era', 'Seattle', 'boys', 'put', 'musical', 'might', 'line', 'new', 'DVD', 'come', 'flying', 'colours', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'obsessed', 'quot', 'Ten', 'quot', 'concert', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'only', 'play', 'two', 'songs', 'album', 'songs', 'quot', 'Riot', 'Act', 'quot', 'really', 'give', 'show', 'substance', 'can', 'see', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'drifting', 'towards', 'becoming', 'real', 'jam', 'band', 'live', 'are', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'Ben', 'Harper', 'couple', 'appearances', 'making', 'statement', 'sang', 'extended', 'end', 'quot', 'Daughter', 'quot', 'Eddie', 'Vedder', 'still', 'blessed', 'one', 'great', 'voices', 'rock', 'are', 'few', 'songs', 'here', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'purchase', 'own', 'quot', 'Black', 'quot', 'classic', 'song', 'quot', 'Ten', 'quot', 'heart-achingly', 'great', 'version', 'quot', 'Betterman', 'quot', 'quot', 'am', 'Mine', 'quot', 'Who', 'quot', 'Baba', ""O'Reilly"", 'quot', 'extended', 'version', 'quot', 'Rearviewmirror', 'quot', '.Hopefully', 'band', 'will', 'be', 'around', 'long', 'time', 'enjoy', 'direction', 'are', 'taking', 'music', 'something', 'rare', 'meaningful']",N/A

Tiraterra ""Fluffy""","[0, 0]","I rushed to the store before noon today to buy both this and their ""Lost Dogs"" CD, so it was a Pearl Jam day for me- that's about a good six hours of their material.  I watched this DVD first, and I was not disappointed.It's a pretty long set- 32 tracks and about three hours long, plus an hour of bonus material.  There are many pleasant surprises here, such as rare appearances of the songs ""Lowlight"", ""Gimme Some Truth"", ""Faithful"", ""Spin the Black Circle"", and ""Breath"".  However, it's ironic that the band chose to put this show out on DVD because it's probably not their best one from the tour, notably falling behind their Massachusetts and even their July 9th New York shows.  The band seems a bit rusty in the beginning especially, and Eddie doesn't talk a whole lot.  That much said, this is still a good show.  The band at times seems to be having great fun, and the crowd is really into the set, showing excitement for such songs unknown to the mainstream as ""Lowlight"".  Ben Harper makes a terrific guest performance, and the show really does close out with a bang with a great version of ""Baba O'Riley"".Comparisons between ""Live at the Garden"" and ""Touring Band 2000"" are inevitable.  They are advantages to both formats.  ""Touring Band 2000"" had more variety in its set list and it was fun watching how the band played in all the different cities, but ""Live at the Garden"" is much less piecemeal and has more material in it.  They are both great holiday gifts for Pearl Jam fans like me, and any hardcore one is sure to enjoy ""Live at the Garden"".",4,A great gift for a Pearl Jam fan,1068508800,"11 11, 2003",2003,1563,"['rushed', 'store', 'noon', 'today', 'buy', 'Lost', 'Dogs', 'CD', 'was', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'day', 'me-', 'good', 'six', 'hours', 'material', 'watched', 'DVD', 'first', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed.It', 'pretty', 'long', 'set-', '32', 'tracks', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'hour', 'bonus', 'material', 'are', 'many', 'pleasant', 'surprises', 'here', 'such', 'rare', 'appearances', 'songs', 'Lowlight', 'Gim', 'Truth', 'Faithful', 'Spin', 'Black', 'Circle', 'Breath', 'However', 'ironic', 'band', 'chose', 'put', 'show', 'out', 'DVD', 'probably', 'not', 'best', 'one', 'tour', 'notably', 'falling', 'Massachusetts', 'even', 'July', '9th', 'New', 'York', 'shows', 'band', 'bit', 'rusty', 'beginning', 'especially', 'Eddie', ""n't"", 'talk', 'whole', 'lot', 'much', 'said', 'still', 'good', 'show', 'band', 'times', 'be', 'having', 'great', 'fun', 'crowd', 'really', 'set', 'showing', 'excitement', 'such', 'songs', 'mainstream', 'Lowlight', 'Ben', 'Harper', 'terrific', 'guest', 'performance', 'show', 'really', 'close', 'out', 'bang', 'great', 'version', 'Baba', ""O'Riley"", '.Comparisons', 'Live', 'Garden', 'Touring', 'Band', '2000', 'are', 'inevitable', 'are', 'advantages', 'formats', 'Touring', 'Band', '2000', 'had', 'more', 'variety', 'set', 'list', 'was', 'fun', 'watching', 'how', 'band', 'played', 'different', 'cities', 'Live', 'Garden', 'much', 'less', 'piecemeal', 'more', 'material', 'are', 'great', 'holiday', 'gifts', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'fans', 'hardcore', 'one', 'sure', 'enjoy', 'Live', 'Garden']",N/A

They were a genuinelive act who's every performance was so intense, one could sware lead singer Eddie Vedder were possesed with the spirit of Jim Morrison. But those days are gone and Pearl Jam has learned that they don't need to blow all their load in every show. Which is to say that this concert, &quot;Live at The Garden,&quot;  doesn't ever bulid up a momentum. There are a few exceptions like INDIFFERENCE, DO THE EVOLUTION and BLACK but none of the other songs come off very convincing or moving. There is of course great moments like BABA O'RILEY and CROWN OF THORNS but those are not exactly Pearl Jam originals(Mother Love Bone, exception) which leads me to assume that Eddie and the boys are tired of playing their music and enjoy other peoples music more. Maybe it was the fact that they had been touring for almost a year by the time they got to New York. I don't know...but you can be assured that there are no bad songs in this DVD, just GOOD performances. If you really want the good stuff I suggest &quot;TOURING BAND&quot; or DVD concerts like LIVE IN AUSTRALIA 1995 or LIVE IN MIAMI 1994,  I personally purchased &quot;LIVE AT THE GARDEN&quot; because I am a BIG PEARL JAM supporter (who should'nt' be buying bootlegs, but I had to do it:)Last beef I had was the awkward montage of the Statue of Liberty in the beginning sequence of the video with the music and pacing .....it was a bit sentimental and almost nationalistic for my taste.
