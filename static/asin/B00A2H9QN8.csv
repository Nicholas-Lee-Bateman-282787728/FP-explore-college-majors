1604340,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B00A2H9QN8,Andre Dursin,"[5, 6]","Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives her all in this extremely uneven independent film from director James Ponsoldt, who co-wrote ""Smashed"" with Susan Burke.Winstead plays an elementary school teacher who binges on booze with husband Aaron Paul. After a series of mishaps (vomiting in class, waking up hungover with no idea where her car is), Winstead decides to become sober, but not until she lies to her boss (Megan Mullally) with the excuse that she's pregnant after throwing up in front of her students. Unfortunately, sobriety comes at a price eventually, not only at work but with her relationship with her usually hung-over significant other.""Smashed"" is all over the place thematically - a few portions come across like outtakes from ""Bad Teacher,"" while other sequences have the feel of an improvised indie drama. Alas, with such a brief running time, almost nothing in the film is satisfactorily developed. Winstead's journey to becoming sober comes so easily that it feels more like a plot device than a fully explored theme, and her relationship with Paul is likewise hackneyed and predictable. The filmmakers also never give us a sense of why these two people were ever together to begin with - hampering the film's effectiveness - which leaves Winstead single-handedly to carry viewers along on an emotional rollercoaster that's never fully fleshed out. Thankfully, she's up to the challenge, bringing nuances and an emotional range that makes you care about her character's plight, even if the movie on balance fails to support her talents.Sony's Blu-Ray includes a number of deleted scenes (some of which might've helped the film's final third), commentary with Ponsoldt and Winstead, a Making Of, Toronto Film Festival Q&A;/red carpet featurette, 1080p AVC encoded transfer and DTS MA 5.1 audio.",3,Mary Elizabeth Winstead puts this Uneven Indie Drama Over the Top,1365033600,"04 4, 2013",2013,1806,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'extremely', 'uneven', 'independent', 'film', 'director', 'James', 'Ponsoldt', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'Smashed', 'Susan', 'Burke.Winstead', 'elementary', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'booze', 'husband', 'Aaron', 'Paul', 'series', 'mishaps', 'vomiting', 'class', 'waking', 'up', 'hungover', 'idea', 'where', 'car', 'Winstead', 'become', 'sober', 'not', 'boss', 'Megan', 'Mullally', 'excuse', 'pregnant', 'throwing', 'up', 'front', 'students', 'Unfortunately', 'sobriety', 'price', 'eventually', 'not', 'only', 'work', 'relationship', 'usually', 'hung-over', 'significant', 'other', 'Smashed', 'place', 'thematically', 'few', 'portions', 'come', 'outtakes', 'Bad', 'Teacher', 'other', 'sequences', 'have', 'feel', 'improvised', 'indie', 'drama', 'Alas', 'brief', 'running', 'time', 'almost', 'nothing', 'film', 'satisfactorily', 'developed', 'Winstead', 'journey', 'becoming', 'sober', 'so', 'easily', 'more', 'plot', 'device', 'fully', 'explored', 'theme', 'relationship', 'Paul', 'likewise', 'hackneyed', 'predictable', 'filmmakers', 'also', 'never', 'give', 'sense', 'why', 'two', 'people', 'were', 'ever', 'together', 'begin', 'hampering', 'film', 'effectiveness', 'Winstead', 'single-handedly', 'carry', 'viewers', 'emotional', 'rollercoaster', 'never', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'Thankfully', 'up', 'challenge', 'bringing', 'nuances', 'emotional', 'range', 'care', 'character', 'plight', 'even', 'movie', 'balance', 'fails', 'support', 'talents.Sony', 'Blu-Ray', 'number', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'might', ""'ve"", 'helped', 'film', 'final', 'third', 'commentary', 'Ponsoldt', 'Winstead', 'Making', 'Toronto', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Q', 'A', '/red', 'carpet', 'featurette', '1080p', 'AVC', 'encoded', 'transfer', 'DTS', 'MA', '5.1', 'audio']",N/A
1604341,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00A2H9QN8,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","At year's start I heard a lot of buzz surrounding a performance given by Mary Elizabeth Winstead in a small film called `Smashed'.  She was supposed to be the big breakout of the year and Oscar buzz was already mounting before many people even saw her film.  In fact, I was predicting her for the Oscar nomination, and the clips that were circulating the internet looked to make good on that promise.  She wasn't anywhere near an Oscar nom, to be honest, but her performance is stellar to say the least.  Her biggest obstacle is the film itself, which just isn't thought out enough to give her raw performance room to fully breathe, but she sinks her teeth in and never stops thrashing; and for that I praise her.The film tells the story of Kate, a young teacher who also happens to be an alcoholic.  Her husband came from money and is pretty much a lazy band chaser who spends his days surfing the internet and playing video games and his nights getting completely trashed.  Kate follows suit in the evenings, downing beer and hard liquor like they were water and suffering the consequences (waking up in urine, shop lifting, smoking crack with a homeless chick).  Finally, after throwing up in front of her students and faking a pregnancy to avoid being caught hungover she realizes that she needs to change, so she accepts an offer from a co-worker to attend AA meetings and, with no help from her husband, she starts to clean up her act.Mary Elizabeth Winstead is sensational here.  She handles the dramatic and the comedic angles of this tonally uneven film really well, and her drunken outburst come from such an honest place.  You feel her pain and her regret and you swell inside for her resolve and her progress.  The film doesn't quite know how to handle this performance though.  It never really gives Winstead a proper foundation and so her performances sits as a solitary moment of clarity in a film that is unfinished.  You never get a real sense of why she's getting sober, how she manages to get sober and where she's planning on going with her life.  It feels like a string of snippets of Kate's life but there are no true connective pieces.Still, Winstead anchors the film the best she can, and Nick Offerman and Aaron Paul are great supporting players (opposite ends of her support group), while Octavia Spencer perfects her crazy eye routine (she scares me) and Megan Mullally thinks she's in a different movie (what an awful performance).All in all this is worth seeing for Winstead alone, but don't expect to get much out of this.",3,It feels too incomplete...,1365465600,"04 9, 2013",2013,2552,"['year', 'start', 'heard', 'lot', 'buzz', 'surrounding', 'performance', 'given', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'small', 'film', 'called', 'Smashed', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'big', 'breakout', 'year', 'Oscar', 'buzz', 'was', 'already', 'mounting', 'many', 'people', 'even', 'saw', 'film', 'fact', 'was', 'predicting', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'clips', 'were', 'circulating', 'internet', 'looked', 'make', 'good', 'promise', 'was', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'Oscar', 'nom', 'be', 'honest', 'performance', 'stellar', 'say', 'least', 'biggest', 'obstacle', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'thought', 'out', 'enough', 'give', 'raw', 'performance', 'room', 'fully', 'breathe', 'teeth', 'never', 'stops', 'thrashing', 'praise', 'her.The', 'film', 'story', 'Kate', 'young', 'teacher', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'alcoholic', 'husband', 'came', 'money', 'pretty', 'much', 'lazy', 'band', 'chaser', 'who', 'days', 'surfing', 'internet', 'playing', 'video', 'games', 'nights', 'getting', 'completely', 'trashed', 'Kate', 'suit', 'evenings', 'downing', 'beer', 'hard', 'liquor', 'were', 'water', 'suffering', 'consequences', 'waking', 'up', 'urine', 'shop', 'lifting', 'smoking', 'crack', 'homeless', 'chick', 'Finally', 'throwing', 'up', 'front', 'students', 'faking', 'pregnancy', 'avoid', 'being', 'caught', 'hungover', 'change', 'offer', 'co-worker', 'attend', 'AA', 'meetings', 'help', 'husband', 'clean', 'up', 'act.Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'sensational', 'here', 'dramatic', 'comedic', 'angles', 'tonally', 'uneven', 'film', 'really', 'well', 'drunken', 'outburst', 'come', 'such', 'honest', 'place', 'feel', 'pain', 'regret', 'swell', 'inside', 'resolve', 'progress', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'how', 'handle', 'performance', 'never', 'really', 'Winstead', 'proper', 'foundation', 'so', 'performances', 'solitary', 'moment', 'clarity', 'film', 'unfinished', 'never', 'get', 'real', 'sense', 'why', 'getting', 'sober', 'how', 'get', 'sober', 'where', 'planning', 'going', 'life', 'string', 'snippets', 'Kate', 'life', 'are', 'true', 'connective', 'pieces.Still', 'Winstead', 'film', 'best', 'can', 'Nick', 'Offerman', 'Aaron', 'Paul', 'are', 'great', 'supporting', 'players', 'opposite', 'ends', 'support', 'group', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'crazy', 'eye', 'routine', 'Megan', 'Mullally', 'different', 'movie', 'what', 'awful', 'performance', '.All', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Winstead', 'alone', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'get', 'much']",N/A

1604345,A3KU995HEIFDNG,B00A2H9QN8,Considering Film (Christopher Bruno),"[3, 4]","""I don't know if I'm an alcoholic, really,"" Kate Hannah says at her first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, ""I just drink. I drink a lot. And I've always drank a lot, everyone I know drinks a lot, so I never really thought it was a problem. But lately it kinda seems like it is."" This is the crux of James Ponsoldt's acute, concise, heartfelt film, co-written with Susan Burke, herself a recovering alcoholic. Smashed understands that alcoholism isn't always the sad, somber burden that the movies tend to portray it as; oftentimes it's actually a lot of fun, and it's only when the physical and psychological toll of a night's bacchanalian revelry becomes too great to shoulder in the morning -- when the drink and its repercussions can no longer be measured independent of one another -- that the alcoholic is compelled to admit his or her problem.Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is an elementary school teacher, dedicated and passionate about her job, who nonetheless spends more than just Friday night carousing about the local bars with her husband Charlie (Aaron Paul) and their friends. She is what you might call a functioning alcoholic; she gets to work on time every day, but not without finishing last night's beer in the shower and taking a swig of whiskey from the flask she keeps in her car before heading in to the classroom. Kate is able to get by like this just fine, until one day the hair of the dog proves a little too much and she suddenly, uncontrollably vomits in the middle of class. Embarrassed and stunned, Kate impulsively says ""Yes"" when her young students ask if she's pregnant, relieved that she doesn't have to explain what a hangover is. Afraid to admit that she's been drinking, Kate plays along when Principal Barnes (Megan Mullally) congratulates her on her pregnancy and sends her home early to rest.In celebration of her impromptu early dismissal, Kate heads out to the bar for drinks and karaoke with Charlie and his friends. Perhaps feeling remorse for her unprofessional episode at work earlier, she doesn't stay long, insisting that she has work to do and should head home. Outside, however, she is stopped by a girl (Mackenzie Davis) who talks Kate into giving her a ride home. ""Home"" turns out to be nothing more than a fire and some boxes in the seedy part of town, and on the drive there she convinces the tipsy Kate to take a hit from her crack pipe. When Kate wakes up the next morning on the ground, miles away from her car and with no recollection of how she got there, she decides that it may be time to grow up and slow down.Charlie keeps pace with Kate, but unlike Kate, he doesn't wet the bed, start drinking first thing in the morning, or end up on the other end of town doing drugs with homeless strangers; so when Kate tells him that she thinks she needs to stop drinking (which she does with a pool cue in one hand and a beer in the other), Charlie doesn't understand why she can't keep drinking and simply stop everything else. ""The drinking is what leads to everything stupid that I do,"" she insists, but for Charlie, who has suffered fewer consequences for his choices than Kate has, it doesn't compute. Charlie seems to think that as long as they drink at home, where there aren't any intruding wayward souls to tempt Kate into transgressing, then she will be in the clear. But when he passes out before she's ready to call it a night, Kate rides her bike to the local store for more booze. When the clerk refuses to break the rules and sell her alcohol after 2am, Kate becomes petulant. First she loses control of her temper, then she loses control of her bladder, urinating on the floor when she is unable to make it to the bathroom in time. The clerk is incensed; when Kate steals a bottle of wine on her way out, he doesn't go after her, he's simply relieved to have her out of the store.Blacking out and waking up on the side of the road twice in one weekend is apparently the limit for Kate, so when she returns to work the next week and Dave (Nick Offerman), the assistant principal, confides that he's nine years sober, she takes heed. Dave -- who saw Kate drinking in the parking lot the morning she threw up in class -- offers to bring her to a meeting. There, Kate meets Jenny (Octavia Spencer), an older woman whose honesty and candor appeals to Kate. ""All that dumb s*** happened,"" Jenny assures her, ""so now I'm glad it's at least entertaining."" Jenny becomes Kate's sponsor, giving her life advice and perspective.For Kate, the biggest asset is having someone who understands that she does have a problem that needs to be addressed and handled. Charlie wants to be supportive; he loves Kate but he doesn't understand why she needs AA. Her estranged mother Rochelle (Mary Kay Place) is no help either; dismissive of her accomplishments and skeptical of her sobriety, Rochelle seems fundamentally unable to be happy for Kate and the new path she is is carving for herself with AA, an organization that Rochelle blames for brainwashing Kate's father and convincing him to abandon their family.It's to the film's credit, however, that there is no villain, no diabolical enabler that is tempting Kate to fail. Instead, Ponsoldt and Burke are compassionate to all their characters, portraying Kate's friends and family as well meaning but misguided. Rochelle loves her daughter, but remains so bitter about her husband's need to leave a toxic relationship that she can't help but see Kate's pride for her success in AA as a slap in the face. Charlie meanwhile continues to drink; he has no malice toward Kate or her decision, he is just unable or unwilling to accept how his actions may affect Kate's. Charlie works from home and comes from a family that is willing and able to support him emotionally and financially; he has not fought for his career, for his house, for his comfort the way that Kate has, and he has no frame of reference to understand how tenuous Kate's self control truly is. Frustrated that he has lost his best drinking buddy, he lashes out at Kate, calling her ""a brainwashed bitch,"" and taking out his insecurities over their lost intimacy on her in the most counterproductive fashion. As sympathetic as he tries to be, Charlie is resentful that he is being excluded from Kate's life, not realizing that he must change with Kate in order to remain with her. ""Love is the easy part,"" Kate tells him, ""it's the rest of this s*** that's hard.""As Kate, Winstead is fantastic; she plays drunk without any affectation or buffoonery, and her conviction and fortitude are never overplayed. She is neither a hero nor a victim; instead, she is a very smart, very real person who has reached the point at which she can no longer shirk responsibility for her actions. Sober for the first time since she was in high school, Kate must go through the arduous task of rediscovering herself, and Winstead nails the mix of surprise and humility, of acceptance and of resolve that comes from honestly assessing your faults and shamelessly taking the steps to improve them. ""Now that I'm not drinking,"" she explains, ""I have all these other problems I have to deal with.""Ultimately, Smashed isn't about alcoholism as much as it is about pinpointing your preferred iteration of yourself and finding the necessary support to help manifest it. Rather than make a facile ode to AA, Ponsoldt and Burke -- with the help of a strong ensemble cast -- have instead explored the nature of support and altruism, as well as their evil twins projection and denial. Kate's family tries to help her by assuring her she doesn't have a problem, but she's smart enough to know better; it's only once she admits her failings and aligns herself with people who care enough to hold her accountable that she is able to make positive change. Jenny assures Kate, ""We all carry s*** in our heads that doesn't make any sense,"" lies and vices that we continue to indulge against our better judgment, but ""at least alcoholics have the tools to work through it."" The choices Kate must make are difficult, for both her and the people she loves, but she's been down far enough to know the value of looking up.[originally published on Considering Film]",4,"""It's

Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","From filmmaker James Ponsoldt (""Off the Black"", ""Junebug and Hurricane"") and writer Susan Burke comes the drama comedy ""Smashed"" which made its debut at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival and was the winner of the U.S. dramatic Special Jury Prize for Excellence in Independent Film Producing.The film stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead (""Final Destination 3&#8243;, ""The Thing"", ""Live Free or Die Hard""), Aaron Paul (""Breaking Bad"", ""Mission: Impossible III"", ""The Last House on the Left""), Octavia Spencer (""The Help"", ""Being John Malkovich"", ""Spider-Man"", ""Seven Pounds""), Nick Offerman (""Parks and Recreation"", ""21 Jump Street"", ""Sin City"") and Megan Mullally (""Will & Grace"", ""Stealing Harvard"").VIDEO, AUDIO AND SUBTITLES:""Smashed"" is presented in 1:85:1 anamorphic widescreen and English, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Thai 5.1 Dolby Digital.  It's important to note that if you want  better picture and audio quality, you want to go for the Blu-ray release of this film.As for the DVD, picture quality is good.  You can still see a fine layer of grain, some scenes are a bit dark at times and the handheld camera can be dizzying for some.  But for the most part, the majority of the film looks good on DVD.Subtitles are in  English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese (Mandarin Traditional), Korean and Thai.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Smashed"" comes with the following special features:Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by director James Ponsoldt and actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead.Making Smashed - (12:24) Behind-the-scenes on the making of ""Smashed"".  James Ponsoldt and Susan Burke talk about how the film came to be.  Interviews with the cast members.Toronto Film Festival Red Carpet Q&A; - (14:45) Q&A; with director James Ponsoldt, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead, actress Octavia Spencer and producer Jennifer Cochis.Deleted Scenes - (10:32) Featuring six deleted scenes.Theatrical Trailer - (1:23) The original theatrical trailer for ""Smashed"".JUDGMENT CALL:In today's society, it's well-known that alcoholics and addicts face major challenges in their first steps of recovery.And while there have been film and television shows on the subject of alcoholism, ""Smashed"" is a fascinating film of one's journey through being sober and how sobriety is not easy.  But it's a crucial step in order for one to take back their life, or else they will end up hurting or getting themselves killed.Mary Elizabeth Winstead does a magnificent job of playing the recovering alcoholic, Kate.  Sometimes one has to fall down so low to realize that their addition is getting the best of them and in this case, the character of Kate constantly wets her bed, she is unfit to work as a teacher for young children and lies about her alcoholism that her sickness is due to pregnancy and it's so bad that when she's drunk, she's out of hand.  Drunk driving, experimenting with drugs, peeing in a store and just not conscious about how bad alcohol has consumed her.But one thing that the film shows is how loved ones can be enablers to alcoholism.  Kate's mother is an alcoholic, her husband likes drinking and encourages her to drink because she would be a more ""fun"" person to be with.And no matter if you have AA and close friends with you to help  you with your recovery, it's also important to eliminate things that will cause you to fall  hard again.It's easy for one to say stay away from those who enable you to do these things, but for the character of Kate and  her husband Charlie, these two are in love and enjoy each other.  But if one is unwilling to be sober or enables it and the other really wants to badly be sober, there is really one way that person can go.Both Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Aaron Paul have great chemistry of playing a happy young married couple but also seeing how this marriage starts to tear itself apart.  But also making the character of Kate thinking if her marriage is actually based on love or the convenience of getting smashed and not growing up.Octavia Spencer does a great job in a supportive role (which she was cast for the film prior to her being cast on ""The Help"") as Jenny, who tries to listen and give advice to Kate.  Megan Mullally plays a more serious role in ""Smashed"" than the comedic roles that she is best known for, so it was good to see her playing a different type of role.  And Nick Offerman as Kate's friend and co-worker who has a crush on her and says the creepiest things.As mentioned earlier, the Blu-ray release is available for ""Smashed"", so if one wants the best picture quality, the Blu-ray is the way to go.  But the DVD release of ""Smashed"" is still good and I detected no major problems with picture quality or audio and there are a good number of special features included.Overall, ""Smashed"" benefits from its wonderful performance by Mary Elizabeth Winstead but also for its gutsy ending.  There are too many people who choose not to solve their problems and are too comfortable with the way things were despite how much pain or trouble they get into.  May it be domestic abuse, gang affiliation, drug addiction and alcohol abuse, ""Smashed"" is a film that shows us that staying sober is not easy and it also means making tough choices for one's survival.A film worth watching!",4,"Smashed"" benefits from its wonderful performance by Mary Elizabeth Winstead but also for its gutsy ending.",1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,5260,"['filmmaker',

1604350,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00A2H9QN8,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[3, 3]","Films dealing with alcoholics are rarely anything less than depressing, with the rare instance of a film like the original ARTHUR (which is a hilarious and heartfelt joy to watch). Going back to THE LOST WEEKEND or DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES to more recent films like Paul Schrader's LIGHT SLEEPER, or really any film dealing with addiction made in the last 20-odd years, alcoholism and addiction are not really to be made light of anymore. It's understandable, and there are always good reasons for film and television dealing with alcoholism and addiction with the appropriate amount of gravitas. James Ponsolt's SMASHED makes a something of a case that a film about alcoholism can have dramatic weight, but can also look at it with a bit of humor in its heart, and that's thanks to a revelatory performance by Mary Elizabeth Winstead and a terrific, if perhaps underused, supporting cast.Winstead plays Kate, a grammar school teacher who, along with her occasionally-employed rock critic husband Charlie (BREAKING BAD's Aaron Paul), have an abiding love of good times and lots of drinks. When Kate finds herself hitting bottom relatively hard (she pukes in front of her class due to her hangover, and lies about being pregnant to them and to the school's principal played by Megan Mullaly), she decides that it's time to get sober. Through the help of the school's vice-principal (Nick Offerman) who recognizes her as a drunk, he gets her into AA. But Charlie isn't terribly supportive of this, and continues to drink. Kate's mom (Mary Kay Place), a long-time functioning alcoholic, also feels that trying to get sober is a fool's errand. Through AA, Kate also meets a friendly and sassy sponsor in Jenny (Octavia Spencer), who she confides in and helps her through the rough times, at least until her personal and work life hit rock-bottom.While the film ends on a note of quiet triumpth, it feels like a good chunk of the film was just excised to get to the meat of the storytelling and really concentrating on Winstead's amazing performance. I've been kind of in love with her since seeing her in flawed films like LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD and DEATH-PROOF, but seeing her as Ramona Flowers in the brilliant SCOTT PILGRIM VS THE WORLD kind of sealed the deal of wanting to see a lot more of her, and this performance is just tremendous. It's not particularly showy in a way that garners awards, but instead, she vanishes into her role physically, down-playing her natural beauty and seeming more plain-jane than we've seen her before, as well as emotionally. Her demeanor flips between highs and lows (including a particularly suspenseful but hilarous moment after she's just smoked crack for the first and only time), and they're all played extremely convincingly. Paul is quite good here, but his character isn't much of a variation on Jesse Pinkman to say that it's a stretch. Mullaly and Offerman, natural comedians, are also a bit of a revelation here as they reach out of their comfort zone. As for the rest of the cast, sadly Spencer and Place are in roles that barely amount to more than cameos, which was pretty disappointing.The script and direction by feature-length newcomer Ponsolt (and co-writer Susan Burke) is very naturalistic and never seems over-wrought. And again, there are moments of genuine humor here, particularly between Winstead and Offerman, who share one of the most uncomfortably funny scenes in recent memory. One of the nice things also about the way that Kate is written is that there's never a scene where she's pushing Charlie to join her in sobriety; she lets their relationship play out and see where he lands. Unfortunately, the film does seem to short some of the characters in its perhaps too brisk 85 minute run-time. It could have done well with either excising some of the characters or giving the supporting cast some more depth.Once it's all said and done, though, this is really Winstead's show, and it's a marvelous, career-changing performance, and if for no other reason, SMASHED should be seen for Winstead.4 out of 5 stars.",4,"Beautifully acted with raw power, but seems too abbrieviated.",1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,4072,"['Films', 'dealing', 'alcoholics', 'are', 'rarely', 'anything', 'less', 'depressing', 'rare', 'instance', 'film', 'original', 'ARTHUR', 'hilarious', 'heartfelt', 'joy', 'watch', 'Going', 'back', 'THE', 'LOST', 'WEEKEND', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'WINE', 'AND', 'ROSES', 'more', 'recent', 'films', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'LIGHT', 'SLEEPER', 'really', 'film', 'dealing', 'addiction', 'made', 'last', '20-odd', 'years', 'alcoholism', 'addiction', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'be', 'made', 'light', 'anymore', 'understandable', 'are', 'always', 'good', 'reasons', 'film', 'television', 'dealing', 'alcoholism', 'addiction', 'appropriate', 'amount', 'gravitas', 'James', 'Ponsolt', 'SMASHED', 'something', 'case', 'film', 'alcoholism', 'can', 'have', 'dramatic', 'weight', 'can', 'also', 'look', 'bit', 'humor', 'heart', 'thanks', 'revelatory', 'performance', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'terrific', 'perhaps', 'underused', 'supporting', 'cast.Winstead', 'plays', 'Kate', 'grammar', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'occasionally-employed', 'rock', 'critic', 'husband', 'Charlie', 'BREAKING', 'BAD', 'Aaron', 'Paul', 'have', 'abiding', 'love', 'good', 'times', 'lots', 'drinks', 'When', 'Kate', 'hitting', 'bottom', 'relatively', 'hard', 'front', 'class', 'due', 'hangover', 'being', 'pregnant', 'school', 'principal', 'played', 'Megan', 'Mullaly', 'time', 'get', 'sober', 'help', 'school', 'vice-principal', 'Nick', 'Offerman', 'who', 'drunk', 'AA', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'supportive', 'drink', 'Kate', 'mom', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'long-time', 'functioning', 'alcoholic', 'also', 'trying', 'get', 'sober', 'fool', 'errand', 'AA', 'Kate', 'also', 'friendly', 'sassy', 'sponsor', 'Jenny', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'who', 'rough', 'times', 'least', 'personal', 'work', 'life', 'hit', 'rock-bottom.While', 'film', 'note', 'quiet', 'triumpth', 'good', 'chunk', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'excised', 'get', 'meat', 'storytelling', 'really', 'concentrating', 'Winstead', 'amazing', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'been', 'kind', 'love', 'seeing', 'flawed', 'films', 'LIVE', 'FREE', 'OR', 'DIE', 'HARD', 'DEATH-PROOF', 'seeing', 'Ramona', 'Flowers', 'brilliant', 'SCOTT', 'PILGRIM', 'VS', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'kind', 'sealed', 'deal', 'wanting', 'see', 'lot', 'more', 'her', 'performance', 'just', 'tremendous', 'not', 'particularly', 'showy', 'way', 'garners', 'awards', 'instead', 'role', 'physically', 'down-playing', 'natural', 'beauty', 'seeming', 'more', 'plain-jane', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before', 'as', 'well', 'emotionally', 'demeanor', 'flips', 'highs', 'lows', 'including', 'particularly', 'suspenseful', 'hilarous', 'moment', 'just', 'smoked', 'crack', 'first', 'only', 'time', ""'re"", 'played', 'extremely', 'convincingly', 'Paul', 'quite', 'good', 'here', 'character', ""n't"", 'much', 'variation', 'Jesse', 'Pinkman', 'say', 'stretch', 'Mullaly', 'Offerman', 'natural', 'comedians', 'are', 'also', 'bit', 'revelation', 'here', 'reach', 'comfort', 'zone', 'rest', 'cast', 'sadly', 'Spencer', 'Place', 'are', 'roles', 'barely', 'amount', 'more', 'cameos', 'was', 'pretty', 'disappointing.The', 'script', 'direction', 'feature-length', 'newcomer', 'Ponsolt', 'co-writer', 'Susan', 'Burke', 'very', 'naturalistic', 'never', 'over-wrought', 'again', 'are', 'moments', 'genuine', 'humor', 'here', 'particularly', 'Winstead', 'Offerman', 'who', 'share', 'one', 'most', 'uncomfortably', 'funny', 'scenes', 'recent', 'memory', 'One', 'nice', 'things', 'also', 'way', 'Kate', 'written', 'never', 'scene', 'where', 'pushing', 'Charlie', 'join', 'sobriety', 'relationship', 'play', 'out', 'see', 'where', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'seem', 'short', 'characters', 'perhaps', 'too', 'brisk', '85', 'minute', 'run-time', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'excising', 'characters', 'giving', 'supporting', 'cast', 'more', 'depth.Once', 'said', 'done', 'though', 'really', 'Winstead', 'show', 'marvelous', 'career-changing', 'performance', 'other', 'reason', 'SMASHED', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'Winstead.4', '5', 'stars']",N/A

Kate and her equally alcoholic husband Charlie (Aaron Paul) seemingly are having a good time, most of which is found in bars with Charlie's friends.One morning Kate is so hung over she upchucks in front of her class and with prompts from the kiddies says she's pregnant and that's what pregnant women do.  Obviously this ruse can only last so long.  Winstead is excellent as Kate makes the change from falling down drunk to straight arrow thanks to support from AA and sponsors played by Oscar winner Octavia Spencer and a socially awkward teaching associate played by Nick Offerman.

1604359,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00A2H9QN8,Paul Allaer,"[33, 39]","""Smashed"" (2012 release; 85 min.) brings the story of a married couple, Charlie (played by Aaron Paul) and Kate (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who enjoy going out and partying it up. Then several incidents happen to Kate (blacking out in the middle of nowhere; throwing up in front of her elementary school students due to a hangover), which really make her rethink the direction of her life. Without so much as consulting with Charlie, she decides almost on a whim to join AA (at the suggestion of a co-worker who has been there before), while Charlie does not. At that point we are just 30 min. into the movie (hence my suggested alternative title for the movie, ""Sober"") and the rest of the movie plays out the strains and challenges which Kate faces with her co-workers at school, Charlie at home, and even her mom to whom she's not particularly close. I'm not going to tell you how it all plays out, as that would just ruin your viewing experience.Couple of thoughts: Mary Elizabeth Winstead carries the film on her shoulders, and she does a terrific job at that, although certainly Aaron Paul (he of ""Breaking Bad"") does a credible job too. There are a couple of pivotal scenes in the second half of the movie between these two as their relationship seems to fall off a cliff after Kate joins AA, and where you can really see how Winstead just throws herself into this role. There is also a small choice role for Octavia Spencer as Jenny, Kate's sponsor at AA. Also worth mentioning is the lovely soundtrack for the movie, with a bunch of obvious and not-so-obvious indie music from the likes of Cass McCombs, Richard & Linda Thompson and, best of all, the song ""Our Anniversary"" by Bill Callahan (a/k/a Smog).This movie clearly was made on a shoestring budget, but it doesn't matter. The is one of those ""little movies that could"", bringing some great performances while examining the fall-out on relationships resulting from being smashed/sober. This is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare.

She is a school teacher of young kids and he is a journalist who writes from home. She sometimes needs a `hair of the dog' to get going in the morning, and as any of us who have been there will know' that can cause a bit or a reflux now and then. Well she manages to chunder in the class room and miss the bin - oops.After managing to lie her way out of the whole episode,  the vice principal lets on that he knows she is an alcoholic as indeed is he and invites her to do a twelve step programme. Well after a night where her antics take her to a very dangerous place albeit in a very funny way, she realises that she has to do something. The problem is that once she sobers up she takes a look at her life with Charlie and finds it wanting. Having personally lived around people `who like a drink', when I heard the phrase `I'm sorry I was drunk' being used as a catch all excuse, it really stopped me in my tracks, I think even I have used that on occasion and it is painful to realise how worthless that excuse is.This is billed as a comedy/drama, and yes it is funny, but it is tragic-comedy and a lot of it is laughing at how pathetic a drunk is and how desperate they can become. Kate is played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead (`Scott Pilgrim vs. the World') and she is completely brilliant and manages to do the drunk bits as both funny and sad. Her husband Charlie is Aaron Paul best known for the TV series `Breaking Bad' as Jesse Pinkman, he is also convincing and compelling in how he tries to change and the interplay between them is excellent. Megan Mullally (Karen from `Will and Grace') plays the Principal and does so straight faced which is just great as a supporting role. The whole thing is well made, brilliantly acted and tackles alcoholism in an honest way and the humour is incidental not the raison d'tre, which is just how it is in real life. I know a few alcoholics and the humour gets them through - up to a point, I intend to lend this to a couple of them as it captures real life so well.

It features a very solid performance by Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Kate Hannah, an elementary school teacher with a serious drinking problem. Perhaps the best scenes come at the beginning of the film: Kate vomits in front of her elementary school children and then attempts to hide the fact that she previously went on a bender by claiming that she's pregnant. Later, she drives drunk with a woman who she just met at a bar and subsequently shares crack with.'Smashed' becomes rather perfunctory when it examines the deteriorating relationship between Kate and her also alcoholic husband, Charlie. When Kate finally decides that she wants to become sober, Charlie rather predictably clings to the bottle and Kate drifts away. But after Kate confesses to her principal that the story about being pregnant was a lie, she's promptly fired and she falls apart.Time does heal all wounds and Kate finally accepts the precepts of AA and gets better. At this point, 'Smashed' feels more like a promo for Alcoholics Anonymous than a drama replete with the requisite twists and turns.There are also a couple of underdeveloped sub-plots including the vice principal, Mr. Davies, a recovering alcoholic who convinces Kate to join AA in the first place but makes a sexual advance that leads to his rejection. Octavia Spencer also has little to do as Kate's sponsor.'Smashed' is partially saved by Ms. Winstead's excellent performance but ultimately becomes too preachy in regards to its anti-alcohol message as well as too predictable in its dissection of the deteriorating relationship between the now recovering wife and booze-addicted husband, set in his alcoholic ways.",2,"Winstead's performance is excellent but film becomes too much of a preachy, AA promo",1360627200,"02 12, 2013",2013,1807,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Rating', '2.5', ""5.0'Smashed"", 'one', 'films', ""n't"", 'require', 'much', 'long-winded', 'critique', 'very', 'solid', 'performance', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'Kate', 'Hannah', 'elementary', 'school', 'teacher', 'serious', 'drinking', 'problem', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'scenes', 'come', 'beginning', 'film', 'Kate', 'vomits', 'front', 'elementary', 'school', 'children', 'then', 'attempts', 'hide', 'fact', 'previously', 'went', 'bender', 'claiming', 'pregnant', 'Later', 'drunk', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'met', 'bar', 'subsequently', 'shares', 'crack', ""'Smashed"", 'becomes', 'rather', 'perfunctory', 'when', 'deteriorating', 'relationship', 'Kate', 'also', 'alcoholic', 'husband', 'Charlie', 'When', 'Kate', 'finally', 'become', 'sober', 'Charlie', 'rather', 'predictably', 'clings', 'bottle', 'Kate', 'away', 'Kate', 'principal', 'story', 'being', 'pregnant', 'was', 'lie', 'promptly', 'fired', 'apart.Time', 'heal', 'wounds', 'Kate', 'finally', 'precepts', 'AA', 'better', 'point', ""'Smashed"", 'feels', 'more', 'promo', 'Alcoholics', 'Anonymous', 'drama', 'replete', 'requisite', 'twists', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'underdeveloped', 'sub-plots', 'including', 'vice', 'principal', 'Mr.', 'Davies', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'Kate', 'join', 'AA', 'first', 'place', 'sexual', 'advance', 'rejection', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'also', 'little', 'do', 'Kate', 'sponsor', ""'Smashed"", 'partially', 'saved', 'Ms.', 'Winstead', 'excellent', 'performance', 'ultimately', 'too', 'preachy', 'regards', 'anti-alcohol', 'message', 'as', 'well', 'too', 'predictable', 'dissection', 'deteriorating', 'relationship', 'now', 'recovering', 'wife', 'booze-addicted', 'husband', 'set', 'alcoholic', 'ways']",N/A
