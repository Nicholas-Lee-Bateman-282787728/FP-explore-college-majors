898360,A72MWEBHCPMXZ,B000850C3C,"Ann Fenner ""catlady21""","[3, 4]","The film deals with three sisters who have to come to grips with the incest and violent physical abuse they suffered as children. As the story unfolds the youngest sister plans to bring the aging father to trial but backs out leaving the other two sisters confused and unsure what to do next. The eldest sister takes up the slack and continues the trial which the father fails to even appear as a defendant. The two brothers who were also suffered physical abuse turn on their sisters, threatening to cut off all contact if they continue to ruin their father's &#34;good name.&#34;  The mother who permitted the abuse also blamed the daughters for all that happened to them. Even though the father was found guilty there was really no resolution. The brothers and the mother were entirely alienated from the 3 sisters who had suffered not only horrible physical abuse & incest but they really achieved very little through the courts system but the airing of their grievances against their ex-law enforcement father. All you could take away from this was a least the horrible secret was out and these 3 sisters could support each other now.The ending informed us that congress had not yet passed the proper laws to protect victims. I got the impression that there was not much out there for the redress of grievance for victims of incest.",3,Ultimate Betrayal,1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,1337,"['film', 'deals', 'three', 'sisters', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'grips', 'incest', 'violent', 'physical', 'abuse', 'suffered', 'children', 'story', 'youngest', 'sister', 'plans', 'bring', 'aging', 'father', 'trial', 'out', 'leaving', 'other', 'two', 'sisters', 'confused', 'unsure', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'eldest', 'sister', 'up', 'slack', 'trial', 'father', 'even', 'appear', 'defendant', 'two', 'brothers', 'who', 'were', 'also', 'suffered', 'physical', 'abuse', 'turn', 'sisters', 'threatening', 'cut', 'off', 'contact', 'continue', 'ruin', 'father', '34', 'good', 'name.', '34', 'mother', 'who', 'permitted', 'abuse', 'also', 'blamed', 'daughters', 'happened', 'Even', 'father', 'was', 'found', 'guilty', 'was', 'really', 'resolution', 'brothers', 'mother', 'were', 'entirely', 'alienated', '3', 'sisters', 'who', 'had', 'suffered', 'not', 'only', 'horrible', 'physical', 'abuse', 'incest', 'really', 'achieved', 'very', 'little', 'courts', 'system', 'airing', 'grievances', 'ex-law', 'enforcement', 'father', 'could', 'take', 'away', 'was', 'least', 'horrible', 'secret', 'was', 'out', '3', 'sisters', 'could', 'support', 'other', 'now.The', 'ending', 'informed', 'congress', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'passed', 'proper', 'laws', 'protect', 'victims', 'got', 'impression', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'there', 'redress', 'grievance', 'victims', 'incest']",Ultimate Betrayal

First she banged her way (with some assistance from her famed fathers last name), to her own dreadful television series. Sometime during the series she became a rabid ""Feminazi"" and went on every talk show that would have her to espouse her (even for the times), over the top views. She publically stated her disdain for her father (and of course the very comfortable lifestyle her Daddy provided while she was growing up),until her dreadful TV show (That Girl), was cancelled. She then did the Hollywood Squares route of has beens and then largely disappeard.I just wish the character she portrayed in this movie was really her and it was old (and she is VERY long in the tooth now), Marlo that had abuse heaped on her in generous proportions while growing up. Heck, Im sure that if some TV talk show paid her $300 she would swear up and down that she was indeed abused as a child growing up under the very benevolent Danny Thomas, her Father.In short Marlo's true nickname rhymes with runt and has a ""C"" in it and I wouldnt be at all surprised if her picture wasnt next to that word in the dictionary.Avoid this movie as watching it might actually put a nickle in Old Marlo's pocket!!",1,"Marlo for one, deserved the abuse!!",1363219200,"03 14, 2013",2013,1239,"['Ever', 'read', 'much', 'nutbag', 'called', 'Marlo', 'Thomas', 'First', 'banged', 'way', 'assistance', 'famed', 'fathers', 'last', 'name', 'own', 'dreadful', 'television', 'series', 'Sometime', 'series', 'became', 'rabid', 'Feminazi', 'went', 'talk', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'espouse', 'even', 'times', 'top', 'views', 'publically', 'stated', 'disdain', 'father', 'course', 'very', 'comfortable', 'lifestyle', 'Daddy', 'provided', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'dreadful', 'TV', 'show', 'Girl', 'was', 'cancelled', 'then', 'did', 'Hollywood', 'Squares', 'route', 'beens', 'then', 'largely', 'disappeard.I', 'just', 'wish', 'character', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'was', 'old', 'VERY', 'long', 'tooth', 'now', 'Marlo', 'had', 'abuse', 'heaped', 'generous', 'proportions', 'growing', 'up', 'Heck', 'Im', 'sure', 'TV', 'talk', 'show', 'paid', '300', 'would', 'swear', 'up', 'was', 'indeed', 'abused', 'child', 'growing', 'up', 'very', 'benevolent', 'Danny', 'Thomas', 'Father.In', 'short', 'Marlo', 'true', 'nickname', 'rhymes', 'runt', 'C', 'wouldnt', 'be', 'surprised', 'picture', 'wasnt', 'word', 'dictionary.Avoid', 'movie', 'watching', 'might', 'actually', 'put', 'nickle', 'Old', 'Marlo', 'pocket']",Ultimate Betrayal

For example, when one of herchildren became pregnant at age 17, the mother was more concerned about how it would affect the family in the socialcircles they frequented-with the &#34;naughty&#34; pregnant girl, than she was about the babies welfare, her daughter's emotionalbeing, or the circumstances surrounding how her daughter got pregnant.
