Facing persecution by family, friends, and the newly established atheist socialist government, the drama shows how timely events unravel their significance in human and spiritual history.As a film it is above average for selection, acting, and development.  The children's key performances are mostly heartfelt.  Susan Whitney is particularly convincing as Lucia, but Sherry Jackson as Jacinta is nearly as believable. Gilbert Rolland plays Hugo, a hearty but well-meaning skeptic-sinner who offers some needed tenderness for the children.

965706,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000E1MXTG,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 3]","Even though Sister Lucia dos Santos reportedly didn't care much for this movie, 1952's The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima presents a moving, albeit overly dramatic, account of the series of visions of the Virgin Mary experienced by three children in Fatima, Portugal, in 1917.  It is primarily the story of the children and the great faith they exhibited in the face of terrible pressures from all sides as the story of their visions spread throughout the countryside.  The message of the Lady herself is somewhat truncated here, as there is no mention of any ""secrets"" and the content that I, as a Protestant, would regard as controversial is never brought to light.  Instead, the movie concentrates more on establishing the sociopolitical context in which the events took place.  Most people know a little something about Fatima, but few can truly appreciate the danger the children faced from the strongly anti-clerical position of the state at that time.While tending to a flock of sheep on a May afternoon in 1917, Lucia dos Santos and her younger friends Jacinta and Francisco Marto are suddenly confronted by the vision of a beautiful lady in the clouds who asks them if they are willing to suffer for the salvation of lost souls and announces that she will visit them on the same day of each of the next several months.  The first person they tell of the vision is the rakish but kind-hearted Hugo da Silva (Gilbert Roland), who is an entirely fictional character who adds a great deal to the film.  He advises them not to tell anyone else, but young Jacinta can't keep such incredible news to herself, and so the story of the visions quickly begins to spread.  While a growing number of people come to believe the story, others dismiss it as a childhood fantasy.  The toughest critic is Lucia's mother, who actually punishes her for telling lies.  The local priest puts no credence in the children's claims, either (suggesting that, if it were true, it was probably the work of the devil), and tries to squelch the story altogether out of fear of government reprisal.  The socialist government that had come to power in Portugal in 1910 had all but made the practice of religion illegal, closing churches and locking up priests and bishops.  While the state had eased up on the restrictions somewhat by 1917, no church officials wanted to risk stirring up any new trouble.  Despite the clergy's best efforts to dismiss the story as the product of a child's imagination, the state does take action, shutting down the local church and putting increasing pressure on the children to recant their story.  That is largely because thousands of  everyday men and women are assembling in Fatima each month to witness the visitations themselves - and the same socialists who shouted ""Power to the people!"" on their road to power fear the assembly of large numbers of people just as much as any other oppressive government once they have achieved their goal.Some critics described a rather passionless performance by Susan Whitney as Lucia, but I thought she did a fantastic job.  Despite all the tears she shed at being accused of lying by the state, the church, and even her own family, she demonstrates an inner peace that comes from understanding, taking on more and more of a beatific radiance as the story works its way up to the famous Miracle of the Sun.  I don't know if it's the lighting or what, but Lucia possesses an aura that is fully captured on film (an effect that modern cinematography seems technically incapable of producing).  You might think that the addition of a source of comic relief in the form of the fictional character Hugo would be a mistake in such a serious drama, but it works beautifully in this script, actually reinforcing - in the end - the power of the message that is at the heart of this story.  This is just a wonderful and emotionally powerful film whichever way you look at it.",5,A powerful and moving film,1312329600,"08 3, 2011",2011,3919,"['Even', 'Sister', 'Lucia', 'dos', 'Santos', 'reportedly', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'movie', '1952', 'Miracle', 'Lady', 'Fatima', 'moving', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'account', 'series', 'visions', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'experienced', 'three', 'children', 'Fatima', 'Portugal', '1917', 'primarily', 'story', 'children', 'great', 'faith', 'exhibited', 'face', 'terrible', 'pressures', 'sides', 'story', 'visions', 'spread', 'countryside', 'message', 'Lady', 'somewhat', 'truncated', 'here', 'mention', 'secrets', 'content', 'Protestant', 'would', 'regard', 'controversial', 'never', 'brought', 'light', 'Instead', 'movie', 'more', 'establishing', 'sociopolitical', 'context', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'Most', 'people', 'know', 'little', 'something', 'Fatima', 'few', 'can', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'danger', 'children', 'faced', 'strongly', 'anti-clerical', 'position', 'state', 'time.While', 'tending', 'flock', 'sheep', 'May', 'afternoon', '1917', 'Lucia', 'Santos', 'younger', 'friends', 'Jacinta', 'Francisco', 'Marto', 'are', 'suddenly', 'confronted', 'vision', 'beautiful', 'lady', 'clouds', 'who', 'asks', 'are', 'willing', 'suffer', 'salvation', 'lost', 'souls', 'announces', 'will', 'visit', 'same', 'day', 'next', 'several', 'months', 'first', 'person', 'tell', 'vision', 'rakish', 'kind-hearted', 'Hugo', 'da', 'Silva', 'Gilbert', 'Roland', 'who', 'entirely', 'fictional', 'character', 'who', 'great', 'deal', 'film', 'not', 'tell', 'anyone', 'else', 'young', 'Jacinta', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'such', 'incredible', 'news', 'herself', 'so', 'story', 'visions', 'quickly', 'spread', 'growing', 'number', 'people', 'come', 'believe', 'story', 'others', 'dismiss', 'childhood', 'fantasy', 'toughest', 'critic', 'Lucia', 'mother', 'who', 'actually', 'telling', 'lies', 'local', 'priest', 'credence', 'children', 'claims', 'either', 'suggesting', 'were', 'true', 'was', 'probably', 'work', 'devil', 'tries', 'squelch', 'story', 'altogether', 'fear', 'government', 'reprisal', 'socialist', 'government', 'had', 'come', 'power', 'Portugal', '1910', 'had', 'made', 'practice', 'religion', 'illegal', 'closing', 'churches', 'locking', 'up', 'priests', 'bishops', 'state', 'had', 'eased', 'up', 'restrictions', 'somewhat', '1917', 'church', 'officials', 'wanted', 'risk', 'stirring', 'up', 'new', 'trouble', 'clergy', 'best', 'efforts', 'dismiss', 'story', 'product', 'child', 'imagination', 'state', 'take', 'action', 'shutting', 'down', 'local', 'church', 'putting', 'increasing', 'pressure', 'children', 'recant', 'story', 'largely', 'thousands', 'everyday', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'assembling', 'Fatima', 'month', 'witness', 'visitations', 'same', 'socialists', 'who', 'shouted', 'Power', 'people', 'road', 'power', 'fear', 'assembly', 'large', 'numbers', 'people', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'oppressive', 'government', 'have', 'achieved', 'goal.Some', 'critics', 'described', 'rather', 'passionless', 'performance', 'Susan', 'Whitney', 'Lucia', 'thought', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'tears', 'shed', 'being', 'accused', 'lying', 'state', 'church', 'even', 'own', 'family', 'inner', 'peace', 'understanding', 'taking', 'more', 'more', 'beatific', 'radiance', 'story', 'way', 'famous', 'Miracle', 'Sun', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'lighting', 'what', 'Lucia', 'aura', 'fully', 'captured', 'film', 'effect', 'modern', 'cinematography', 'technically', 'incapable', 'producing', 'might', 'think', 'addition', 'source', 'comic', 'relief', 'form', 'fictional', 'character', 'Hugo', 'would', 'be', 'mistake', 'such', 'serious', 'drama', 'beautifully', 'script', 'actually', 'reinforcing', 'end', 'power', 'message', 'heart', 'story', 'just', 'wonderful', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'film', 'whichever', 'way', 'look']",The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima

965719,A1VF0102Z9VITO,B000E1MXTG,Joseph M. Reninger,"[0, 1]","Three peasant children have a vision in the fields of Fatima, Portugal, of a lovely lady who asks them to come back for six months on the thirteenth. More importantly, she asks them to pray for peace in the world. Portugal in 1917 is still struggling under an atheistic government (the product of a socialist revolution in 1910) that tries to suppress religious sentiments in the people. A small town like Fatima seems an unlikely place for an outburst of religious fervor, the kind of which makes authorities nervous. Word gets around and people start coming to see the Blessed Virgin Mary and ask for her intercession in the subsequent months.The film is a reasonably good survey of the events of 1917, providing enough of the revolution history to show the dangers coming from the government (it does seem slightly motivated by Cold War attitudes as well as by dramatic impact). The children, Lucia and her cousins Francisco and Jacinta, are simple and pious. They refuse to deny the visions in spite of opposition from Lucia's mother, their parish priest, and the local magistrate. A ne'er-do-well adult by the name of Hugo is added as a cynical advocate for the children. He helps in practical matters but has no faith at the start of the movie. He's the most colorful character even though his arc from rapscallion to believer is fairly obvious from the moment he shows up. Most of the other people (aside from Lucia's mother) are not fleshed out enough. The end of the movie gives the (then) most recent history of pilgrims flocking to the church built on the site of the apparitions, along with an older Hugo and Lucia talking about their lives.The story of the apparitions in Fatima is an interesting one and has had a great impact on the Catholic faith in the twentieth century. But the film, as accurate as it is, is also a bit too sweet and plays it too safe. The socialists are clearly bad guys, but they never actually hurt people other than putting them in jail and closing the church. A scene where the magistrate threatens to boil the children in oil slowly is a bit scary, but the most actual discomfort the children are put through is banishment to a furnished room and later, a jail cell full of ruffians who wind up praying the rosary with the children (possibly my favorite scene in the film). The dramatic tension is never very tight; the stakes never seem high. The movie isn't bad except for being bland. The actors playing Lucia and Hugo were quite good.",3,"Good, not great, film of the real events",1395014400,"03 17, 2014",2014,2480,"['Three', 'peasant', 'children', 'have', 'vision', 'fields', 'Fatima', 'Portugal', 'lovely', 'lady', 'who', 'come', 'back', 'six', 'months', 'thirteenth', 'More', 'importantly', 'pray', 'peace', 'world', 'Portugal', '1917', 'still', 'struggling', 'atheistic', 'government', 'product', 'socialist', 'revolution', '1910', 'suppress', 'religious', 'sentiments', 'people', 'small', 'town', 'Fatima', 'unlikely', 'place', 'outburst', 'religious', 'fervor', 'kind', 'authorities', 'nervous', 'Word', 'around', 'people', 'start', 'coming', 'see', 'Blessed', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'ask', 'intercession', 'subsequent', 'months.The', 'film', 'reasonably', 'good', 'survey', 'events', '1917', 'providing', 'enough', 'revolution', 'history', 'show', 'dangers', 'coming', 'government', 'seem', 'slightly', 'motivated', 'Cold', 'War', 'attitudes', 'as', 'well', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'children', 'Lucia', 'cousins', 'Francisco', 'Jacinta', 'are', 'simple', 'pious', 'refuse', 'deny', 'visions', 'spite', 'opposition', 'Lucia', 'mother', 'parish', 'priest', 'local', 'magistrate', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'adult', 'name', 'Hugo', 'added', 'cynical', 'advocate', 'children', 'practical', 'matters', 'faith', 'start', 'movie', 'most', 'colorful', 'character', 'even', 'arc', 'rapscallion', 'believer', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'moment', 'up', 'Most', 'other', 'people', 'aside', 'Lucia', 'mother', 'are', 'not', 'fleshed', 'out', 'enough', 'end', 'movie', 'then', 'most', 'recent', 'history', 'pilgrims', 'flocking', 'church', 'built', 'site', 'apparitions', 'older', 'Hugo', 'Lucia', 'talking', 'lives.The', 'story', 'apparitions', 'Fatima', 'interesting', 'one', 'had', 'great', 'impact', 'Catholic', 'faith', 'twentieth', 'century', 'film', 'as', 'accurate', 'also', 'bit', 'too', 'sweet', 'too', 'safe', 'socialists', 'are', 'clearly', 'bad', 'guys', 'never', 'actually', 'hurt', 'people', 'other', 'putting', 'jail', 'closing', 'church', 'scene', 'where', 'magistrate', 'boil', 'children', 'oil', 'slowly', 'bit', 'scary', 'most', 'actual', 'discomfort', 'children', 'are', 'put', 'banishment', 'furnished', 'room', 'later', 'jail', 'cell', 'full', 'ruffians', 'who', 'wind', 'up', 'praying', 'rosary', 'children', 'possibly', 'favorite', 'scene', 'film', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'never', 'very', 'tight', 'stakes', 'never', 'seem', 'high', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'being', 'bland', 'actors', 'playing', 'Lucia', 'Hugo', 'were', 'quite', 'good']",The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima

I still can't watch it without a lump in the throat.True, the film has many deficiencies:- Preposterous liberties have been taken with the basic story to make it conform to the tastes of early '50s Hollywood. They even get the date of the first vision wrong! The top-billed star of the movie (Gilbert Roland, as ""Hugo"") plays a character that never existed. Many other characters have been added, deleted or conflated to suit the drama at the expense of accuracy. Some artistic license is to be expected, but this script crosses the line into disrespect for history.- The major cast members don't look or sound Portuguese at all, especially the three children, who look as if they were cast from a Sunday school class in Kansas.- Although most of the cast (including Angela Clarke, as Lucia's mother) perform with reasonable taste and restraint, a few major players are completely out of control. Frank Silvera (Administrator Artur dos Santos) snarls, grinds his teeth and chomps his cigar like a mustache-twirling silent movie villain. Sherry Jackson (Jacinta) bursts into tears at the slightest provocation. She spends half the movie bawling!- The conversations between Lucia and the Lady have been recklessly scrambled and abridged. This may be one reason why the real Lucia didn't like the movie when it was shown to her.Thankfully, none of these problems are enough to destroy the powerful sense of wonder and vindication at the end. And Max Steiner's Oscar-nominated choral score captures the otherworldliness of the visions with haunting grace.The long-awaited DVD is sharp and free from scratches and dust, but the color is very odd. Sometimes the hues are vividly hyper-saturated and garish, other times pale and muddy. These were apparently common characteristics of the early-50s WarnerColor process. Aspect ratio is 1.33:1 as photographed, with monaural sound.Whether or not you believe that the events at Fatima were manifestations of the divine, this flawed but heartfelt production demonstrates beyond any doubt the nobility and beauty of this mysterious story.",4,"Sappy and inaccurate, yes ... but moving nonetheless",1232841600,"01 25, 2009",2009,2164,"['movie', 'deeply', 'affected', 'when', 'saw', 'black-and-white', 'television', '1960s', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'lump', 'throat.True', 'film', 'many', 'deficiencies', 'Preposterous', 'liberties', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'basic', 'story', 'make', 'conform', 'tastes', 'early', 'Hollywood', 'even', 'get', 'date', 'first', 'vision', 'wrong', 'top-billed', 'star', 'movie', 'Gilbert', 'Roland', 'Hugo', 'character', 'never', 'existed', 'Many', 'other', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'deleted', 'conflated', 'suit', 'drama', 'expense', 'accuracy', 'artistic', 'license', 'be', 'expected', 'script', 'line', 'disrespect', 'history.-', 'major', 'cast', 'members', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'sound', 'Portuguese', 'especially', 'three', 'children', 'who', 'look', 'were', 'cast', 'Sunday', 'school', 'class', 'Kansas.-', 'most', 'cast', 'including', 'Angela', 'Clarke', 'Lucia', 'mother', 'perform', 'reasonable', 'taste', 'restraint', 'few', 'major', 'players', 'are', 'completely', 'control', 'Frank', 'Silvera', 'Administrator', 'Artur', 'dos', 'Santos', 'snarls', 'teeth', 'chomps', 'cigar', 'mustache-twirling', 'silent', 'movie', 'villain', 'Sherry', 'Jackson', 'Jacinta', 'tears', 'slightest', 'provocation', 'movie', 'bawling', 'conversations', 'Lucia', 'Lady', 'have', 'been', 'recklessly', 'scrambled', 'abridged', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'real', 'Lucia', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'shown', 'her.Thankfully', 'none', 'problems', 'are', 'enough', 'destroy', 'powerful', 'sense', 'wonder', 'vindication', 'end', 'Max', 'Steiner', 'Oscar-nominated', 'choral', 'score', 'otherworldliness', 'visions', 'haunting', 'grace.The', 'long-awaited', 'DVD', 'sharp', 'free', 'scratches', 'dust', 'color', 'very', 'odd', 'Sometimes', 'hues', 'are', 'vividly', 'hyper-saturated', 'garish', 'other', 'times', 'pale', 'muddy', 'were', 'apparently', 'common', 'characteristics', 'early-50s', 'WarnerColor', 'process', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '1.33:1', 'photographed', 'monaural', 'sound.Whether', 'not', 'believe', 'events', 'Fatima', 'were', 'manifestations', 'divine', 'flawed', 'heartfelt', 'production', 'doubt', 'nobility', 'beauty', 'mysterious', 'story']",The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima

while playing in the woods - who identified herself as the 'LADY OF THE ROSARY'.The children's extraordinary event was treated with an attitude of doubt and whole 'skepticism'..but with 'courage' they fought the 'threat' that gripped them from strong opposition from the local authority, the Magistrate (Carl Milletaire) and with 'faith' as with the help of their loyal friend Hugo da Silva (Gilbert Roland) they convinced their 'frightened'parents (Angela Clarke, Jay Novello, Norman Rice & Frances Morris) giving them with 'truth' a new meaning to life in F&aacute;tima.On October 13, 1917, the Portuguese people understood the radiance of their inspiring story when a crowd (generally estimated at about l00,000) gathered at F&aacute;tima and witnessed a 'MIRACULOUS SOLAR PHENOMENON', immediately after the 'LADY' had appeared to the 3 children healing 'lame' and 'blind' people as well.Photographed in Technicolor and with a sincere screenplay, this beautiful religious film - that I recommend highly - was remarkably intense and profound in thoughts and feelings.John Brahm's direction had its fine moments and Max Steiner's music - Nominated for Best Scoring of a Dramatic Picture - flourished the screen with sounds of tenderness and sympathy.The performance of Gilbert Roland and the 3 peasant children were entirely moving and convincing..throbbing the beat of our heart with deep 'faith', complete 'belief' and loyal 'truth'.To the readers who are interested in 'Our Lady of Fatima', I can add that after initial opposition, the bishop of Leiria on October 13, 1930 accepted the children's visions as the appearance of the VIRGIN MARY and in the same year, papal indulgences were granted to pilgrims.",4,'You Promise To Give Us A Miracle!',1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,2362,"['1917', 'mountain', 'village', 'F', 'aacute', 'central', 'Portugal', 'located', 'tableland', 'Cova', 'Da', 'Iria', 'southeast', 'Leiria', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'Marian', 'shrines', 'world', 'visited', 'thousands', 'pilgrims', 'annually', 'Miracle', 'Lady', 'Fatima', 'opened', ""'persecution"", 'Clerical', 'Orders', 'opposed', 'government', 'throwing', 'priests', 'prison', 'common', 'criminals..On', 'May', '23', '1917', 'subsequent', 'month', 'October', 'three', 'young', 'peasant', 'children', 'Lucia', 'dos', 'Santos', 'Susan', 'Whitney', 'cousins', 'Francisco', 'Marto', 'Sammy', 'Ogg', 'Jacinta', 'Marto', 'Sherry', 'Jackson', 'reportedly', 'saw', ""'LADY"", 'little', 'tree', 'playing', 'woods', 'who', 'identified', ""'LADY"", 'THE', ""ROSARY'.The"", 'children', 'extraordinary', 'event', 'was', 'treated', 'attitude', 'doubt', 'whole', ""'skepticism'..but"", ""'courage"", 'fought', ""'threat"", 'gripped', 'strong', 'opposition', 'local', 'authority', 'Magistrate', 'Carl', 'Milletaire', ""'faith"", 'help', 'loyal', 'friend', 'Hugo', 'da', 'Silva', 'Gilbert', 'Roland', 'convinced', ""'frightened'parents"", 'Angela', 'Clarke', 'Jay', 'Novello', 'Norman', 'Rice', 'Frances', 'Morris', 'giving', ""'truth"", 'new', 'meaning', 'life', 'F', 'aacute', 'October', '13', '1917', 'Portuguese', 'people', 'understood', 'radiance', 'inspiring', 'story', 'when', 'crowd', 'generally', 'estimated', 'l00,000', 'gathered', 'F', 'aacute', 'witnessed', ""'MIRACULOUS"", 'SOLAR', 'PHENOMENON', 'immediately', ""'LADY"", 'had', 'appeared', '3', 'children', 'healing', ""'lame"", ""'blind"", 'people', 'well.Photographed', 'Technicolor', 'sincere', 'screenplay', 'beautiful', 'religious', 'film', 'recommend', 'highly', 'was', 'remarkably', 'intense', 'profound', 'thoughts', 'feelings.John', 'Brahm', 'direction', 'had', 'fine', 'moments', 'Max', 'Steiner', 'music', 'Nominated', 'Best', 'Scoring', 'Dramatic', 'Picture', 'flourished', 'screen', 'sounds', 'tenderness', 'sympathy.The', 'performance', 'Gilbert', 'Roland', '3', 'peasant', 'children', 'were', 'entirely', 'moving', 'convincing..throbbing', 'beat', 'heart', 'deep', ""'faith"", 'complete', ""'belief"", 'loyal', 'readers', 'who', 'are', 'interested', ""'Our"", 'Lady', 'Fatima', 'can', 'add', 'initial', 'opposition', 'bishop', 'Leiria', 'October', '13', '1930', 'accepted', 'children', 'visions', 'appearance', 'VIRGIN', 'MARY', 'same', 'year', 'papal', 'indulgences', 'were', 'granted', 'pilgrims']",The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima
