Over the years I have had several people rave about how great this movie was, telling me how I had to see it because of its awesomeness.  So, I finally rented it and I thought it was pretty bad.  The main character is a dick and the whole movie I was just thinking that he should treat his folks better and stop being such a punk douche.  Then after they set him up for being a douche they try to make you care for him... No, he is douche, I will not care for a douche.  Seeing that the only honorable characters in this movie were his folks, I was not emotionally invested at all.  Some of the cars were super cool to look at, and some of the drifting was good, but a lot of the drifting was also poor looking special effects...

Like the two films that proceeded it, `The Fast and the Furious - Tokyo Drift' is a high octane rollercoaster ride littered with fast cars and fast women, and for its target audience (teenage boys) it hits every mark just right.  Now I am a huge fan of the first film, and a minor fan of the second.  I had absolutely no expectations for this film (I thought that the previews looked lame, and no one from either of the previous films was making an appearance, well, Vin is in the last 30 seconds but that doesn't count) so when I watched it I was increasingly impressed with how much I was enjoying myself.I'll point out first off that I was much relieved to see that Zachery Ty Bryan was only in the first few minutes of the film and that his character was not explored throughout the film...I can't stand him.  That aside, Lucus Black (Friday Night Lights & Jarhead) does a great job here as Sean.  Lucus is a much better actor than the overrated Paul Walker (sure, he's got great abs but his acting ability is below B-Grade) and actually made his character interesting.  Sung Kang was also very good as Han and Brian Tee was believable in all his irritating bad-boyness as DK.  Bow Wow takes the place of Ludacris and Ja Rule before him as the rapper-guy side kick, and he does an alright job, but he just doesn't really fit here (Luda was by far the best of the three).  Nathalie Kelly plays Neela, the girl Sean is fighting for, and she is amply hot enough to vie for attention.Sure the plot of weak and the relationships are unbelievable, I mean who can honestly say that they feel a kingpin to the Japanese/Chinese/Oriental (whatever it was) Mafia is going to agree to have his nephew and some stranger race to squash their beef?  But, like I said, it doesn't have to make sense, it doesn't have to be believable.  `The Fast and the Furious' franchise have done quite well for themselves giving the growing young boys of the world exactly what they want, sleek fast cars coupled with hot young tail.",4,Pointless entertainment is still entertainment!,1162252800,"10 31, 2006",2006,2249,"['really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'too', 'much', 'almost', 'scene', 'film', 'so', 'far', 'believable', 'not', 'movie', 'designed', 'make', 'sense', 'designed', 'keep', 'audience', 'seats', 'sense', 'movie', 'two', 'films', 'proceeded', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'Tokyo', 'Drift', 'high', 'octane', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'littered', 'fast', 'cars', 'fast', 'women', 'target', 'audience', 'teenage', 'boys', 'mark', 'just', 'right', 'Now', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'first', 'film', 'minor', 'fan', 'second', 'had', 'absolutely', 'expectations', 'film', 'thought', 'previews', 'looked', 'lame', 'one', 'previous', 'films', 'was', 'making', 'appearance', 'well', 'Vin', 'last', '30', 'seconds', ""n't"", 'count', 'when', 'watched', 'was', 'increasingly', 'impressed', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'enjoying', 'myself.I', ""'ll"", 'point', 'out', 'first', 'was', 'much', 'relieved', 'see', 'Zachery', 'Ty', 'Bryan', 'was', 'only', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'explored', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'aside', 'Lucus', 'Black', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'Jarhead', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'Sean', 'Lucus', 'much', 'better', 'actor', 'overrated', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'sure', 'got', 'great', 'abs', 'acting', 'ability', 'B-Grade', 'actually', 'made', 'character', 'interesting', 'Sung', 'Kang', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Han', 'Brian', 'Tee', 'was', 'believable', 'irritating', 'bad-boyness', 'DK', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'place', 'Ludacris', 'Ja', 'Rule', 'before', 'rapper-guy', 'side', 'kick', 'alright', 'job', 'just', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'here', 'Luda', 'was', 'far', 'best', 'three', 'Nathalie', 'Kelly', 'Neela', 'girl', 'Sean', 'fighting', 'amply', 'hot', 'enough', 'vie', 'attention.Sure', 'plot', 'weak', 'relationships', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'mean', 'who', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'feel', 'kingpin', 'Japanese/Chinese/Oriental', 'was', 'Mafia', 'going', 'agree', 'have', 'nephew', 'stranger', 'race', 'squash', 'beef', 'said', ""n't"", 'have', 'make', 'sense', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'believable', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'franchise', 'have', 'done', 'quite', 'well', 'giving', 'growing', 'young', 'boys', 'world', 'exactly', 'what', 'want', 'sleek', 'fast', 'cars', 'coupled', 'hot', 'young', 'tail']",The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift

644456,AUTJJLEECEI2R,B00005JP03,Dorothea,"[11, 12]","The cast in this movie was extremely well chosen, and they all acted very well.  Sean is a reckless, charming, somewhat troubled teenager, but he doesn't come across as stupid and careless--despite his angst and frequent bungles, he is immediately likable.  When a car race with a peer at his school results in two wrecked cars and extensive damage to a local construction site, the only alternative he has to jail is to move to Tokyo and live with a relative (his father, I thought, but maybe his uncle...).In Tokyo, Sean quickly discovers the racing scene.  After trashing a race car, he has no choice but to work for Han, the car's owner, as compensation.  Han is by far the best character in this movie, to the point that he seems out of place--you just don't expect a character THAT good in this sort of action flick.  Han is a whimsical, philosophical and intense character.  He completely upstages Sean and almost from the first moment you see him, calmly eating his chips while he watches Sean destroy his expensive race car, you want to see more of him.Much of the movie's impetus comes from D.K. and Neela.  D.K., short for ""Drift King,"" is the top racer in the area and the nephew of a local yakuza boss.  He's partners with Han and is obsessed with Neela, a peer of Sean's at school.  D.K. dislikes Sean immediately, noting Sean's interest in Neela and tensions between the two of them escalate throughout the movie, leading to the ""climax"" which is a night race down an extremely windy road out in the middle of nowhere.  The races in general are pretty entertaining and are a good length, time-wise.This was a good flick with a few really excellent qualities.  The plot was a little hazy but there was one, and the characters were very well developed.  Just the Han character made it worth seeing, for me.  I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys action movies.

I enjoyed watching them move fast and was appreciative of my sound system because when they zoomed by not only did it sound good, but my bass made it feel good.  The drifting was pretty cool, though by the end of the movie there was just too much focus on that aspect of ""racing"".  This movie had some cool car chases and car races, even before the drifting came into play.  The races were the only thing keeping me on the edge of my seat.HD-DVD.  I'm reviewing the HD-DVD version of this movie.  Wow!!!  Every scene was pristine and awesome.  Not a single detail gets missed and was one of the better high definition movies out there as far as film quality goes (some of them don't look much better than a standard DVD does).  I'll give the movie an extra start just for this.Unfortunately, there was a lot of bad about the movie:The story.  Ugh!!!  It was hard to find anything in this story that was believable or smart.  Little in this movie actually made sense.  Often times when a movie's story is this terrible it seems like the writers and actors were aware of this and you could tell it in the performance.  But I'm actually afraid that those involved with the story actually thought it was a good story.The acting.  Oh please.The love story.  Blech!The reality factor.  I'm more likely believe movies like ""Battlefield Earth"" would happen before anything in this movie would actually happen.By the middle of the movie I just started fast forwarding to the action.

I liked the first movie and felt that the absence of all original stars would make this lame.  I was only partially correct.The predictable obvious:-There will be a substitute for Paul Walker.Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) is an average substitute.  While a competent actor, he doesn't quite have the big man on campus/sliver spoon/prom king vibe that Paul Walker oozed.-There will be a substitute for Vin Diesel.D.K. ""Drift King"" (Brian Tee) is not even half of what Diesel was, despite the fact that he's supposed to be linked to Yakuza.  To be quite honest, he's neither as tough as either of Vin Diesel's bearded sycophants for the original, nor the original Asian bad guy.-There will be copious hot women.This was improvement over the original.  It would be pointless to prove this FACT; just go to the IMDB page and click the link for each actress.  Then google the ones that don't have pictures.  Trust me on this.  For starters, however: Nathalie Kelley, Nikki Griffin, Ashika Gogna, Caroline de Souza Correa, Verena Mei.-There will be a ton of racing and fancy cars.The racing in this movie is undoubtedly better than the original.  In fact, there appears to be more racing than storyline, which is probably for the best.  As for that...American kid gets in trouble for racing - he's been in trouble before.  He's forced to go to Japan to live with his Navy father.  In a matter of not time he finds the racing scene in Japan, where ""drifting"" is all the rage - it's nothing new, they did it on the Dukes of Hazzard all the time.  Boy wrecks car, owes someone car, gets involved in shady criminal underworld, becomes inexplicably trusted and befriended by nearly all popular people in school.  Boy gets girl, learns to race, wins final race, overcomes difficulties, saves the day.  Aside from that, there a few highly ridiculous parts of the script - particularly a gaijin taking on the Yakuza in any format and Bow Wow's groan inducing performance/subplot - that take quite a bit away from the movie.It's exactly what one would expect.  It lacks the ""star"" power of the original, but makes up for it with hot women and fast cars...or is it the other way around?",4,Fast and the Spurious,1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,2228,"['admit', 'have', 'put', 'movie', 'quite', 'time', 'liked', 'first', 'movie', 'felt', 'absence', 'original', 'stars', 'would', 'make', 'lame', 'was', 'only', 'partially', 'correct.The', 'predictable', 'obvious', 'will', 'be', 'substitute', 'Paul', 'Walker.Sean', 'Boswell', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'average', 'substitute', 'competent', 'actor', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'big', 'man', 'campus/sliver', 'spoon/prom', 'king', 'vibe', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'oozed.-There', 'will', 'be', 'substitute', 'Vin', 'Diesel.D.K', 'Drift', 'King', 'Brian', 'Tee', 'not', 'even', 'half', 'what', 'Diesel', 'was', 'fact', 'supposed', 'be', 'linked', 'Yakuza', 'be', 'quite', 'honest', 'as', 'tough', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'bearded', 'sycophants', 'original', 'original', 'Asian', 'bad', 'guy.-There', 'will', 'be', 'copious', 'hot', 'women.This', 'was', 'improvement', 'original', 'would', 'be', 'pointless', 'prove', 'FACT', 'just', 'go', 'IMDB', 'page', 'click', 'link', 'actress', 'Then', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'pictures', 'Trust', 'starters', 'however', 'Nathalie', 'Kelley', 'Nikki', 'Griffin', 'Ashika', 'Gogna', 'Caroline', 'Souza', 'Correa', 'Verena', 'Mei.-There', 'will', 'be', 'ton', 'racing', 'fancy', 'cars.The', 'racing', 'movie', 'undoubtedly', 'better', 'original', 'fact', 'be', 'more', 'racing', 'storyline', 'probably', 'best', 'American', 'kid', 'trouble', 'racing', 'been', 'trouble', 'before', 'forced', 'go', 'Japan', 'live', 'Navy', 'father', 'matter', 'not', 'time', 'racing', 'scene', 'Japan', 'where', 'drifting', 'rage', 'nothing', 'new', 'did', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'time', 'Boy', 'car', 'someone', 'car', 'involved', 'shady', 'criminal', 'underworld', 'inexplicably', 'trusted', 'befriended', 'nearly', 'popular', 'people', 'school', 'Boy', 'girl', 'race', 'final', 'race', 'difficulties', 'day', 'Aside', 'few', 'highly', 'ridiculous', 'parts', 'script', 'particularly', 'gaijin', 'taking', 'Yakuza', 'format', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'groan', 'inducing', 'performance/subplot', 'take', 'quite', 'bit', 'away', 'movie.It', 'exactly', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'star', 'power', 'original', 'up', 'hot', 'women', 'fast', 'cars', 'other', 'way']",The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift

This movie seemed to have quite a lot of plot holes.  Anyway, here is what I learnt about the world from this movie -1) The yakuza (they play the bad guys in this movie) have nothing better to do than race cars.2) If you are a car racer, you will never have to do jail time for any crimes you commit.3) If you cannot drive at top speed and make hairpin turns through a car park without crashing into something, you are a loser.4) Only gorgeous girls and guys with perfect bodies can drift.5) Everyone in the school is either rich, gorgeous or a gangster.6) It is perfectly okay to offer your car to a total stranger in a race - just to see what he's made of.7) Even if you get in a race containing three cars and drive at top speed through a full city, and end up killing someone, then the police will do nothing about it.8) If you are beautiful and blonde, it is a good idea to offer yourself up as the prize for a race, so your boyfriend gets involved in a race with another guy and almost kills all three of you.9) It is an even better idea to scream at your boyfriend that he doesn't love you when he is neck-and-neck with another car, so that he rams into the other car on purpose.10) If you walk away from a fight, you are a loser.",2,Things I learned from watching this movie.,1164067200,"11 21, 2006",2006,1307,"['learned', 'quite', 'few', 'interesting', 'things', 'life', 'movie', 'movie', 'seemed', 'have', 'quite', 'lot', 'plot', 'holes', 'Anyway', 'here', 'what', 'learnt', 'world', 'movie', '-1', 'yakuza', 'play', 'bad', 'guys', 'movie', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'race', 'cars.2', 'are', 'car', 'racer', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'do', 'jail', 'time', 'crimes', 'commit.3', 'can', 'not', 'drive', 'top', 'speed', 'make', 'hairpin', 'car', 'park', 'crashing', 'something', 'are', 'loser.4', 'Only', 'gorgeous', 'girls', 'guys', 'perfect', 'bodies', 'can', 'drift.5', 'Everyone', 'school', 'rich', 'gorgeous', 'gangster.6', 'perfectly', 'okay', 'offer', 'car', 'total', 'stranger', 'race', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'made', 'of.7', 'Even', 'get', 'race', 'containing', 'three', 'cars', 'drive', 'top', 'speed', 'full', 'city', 'end', 'up', 'killing', 'someone', 'then', 'police', 'will', 'do', 'nothing', 'it.8', 'are', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'good', 'idea', 'offer', 'up', 'prize', 'race', 'boyfriend', 'involved', 'race', 'guy', 'almost', 'kills', 'three', 'you.9', 'even', 'better', 'idea', 'scream', 'boyfriend', ""n't"", 'love', 'when', 'neck-and-neck', 'car', 'so', 'other', 'car', 'purpose.10', 'walk', 'away', 'fight', 'are', 'loser']",The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift
644476,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00005JP03,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[2, 5]","Before I start I would like to say that it breaks my heart to see all these gorgeous cars get wasted like that. I never heard of drifting till this movie came across my path and I was intrigued by what it entails. Anyway, I rather enjoyed the first one, the second one was decent but could have been better, and ""Tokyo Drift"" was.......interesting (?). If one thing's for certain, every installment of ""The Fast & The Furious"" is known for several things: cardboard acting, bare-bones plot, and tense racing scenes. For the first two movies, Paul Walker was the lead, and in every movie, he had to go undercover as a gangsta street racer taking down a syndicate. Sure, those movies weren't really deep, but with a good sense of humor to back up the implausibility, no one cared. Those movies made buck.Well, now that Paul Walker has left, along with Tyrese Gibson and Vin, the latest installment switches gears for a new type of ball game. Instead of an undercover cop, we got Brian O'Conner, as Lucas Black, (who almost ruined the movie for me due to his terrible accent and unconvincing age) as the trouble maker going hand to hand against the Yakuza. Justin Lin (""Better Luck Tomorrow"") is, of course, leading the franchise to a new direction trying to add some bones to the franchise, but with the original producers of the franchise - Amanda Cohen (sister of director Rob Cohen, or so I think) and Neal H. Moritz - involved, it's pretty much the same deal. But that does NOT mean there's some fun to be had. They did a great job choreographing the cars and street scenes which kept my adrenaline pumping. They've done away with the ""hyperspace"" graphics when someone presses the nitrous button. There are a few scenes where the ""hero"", whilst learning to drift, thwacks a wall and the car doesn't show the damage in the next scene, but does at the end, but that is just down to bad editing. You'd think it'd be easy enough these days to CGI a few dents in for effect.Obviously, as soon as the intro and credits (for the first time) kick in, you get that feeling that you're not seeing an Oscar-winning hit here. For this installment of ""F&F;,"" the budgets has gone smaller, but the ingredients are still there: CG-rendered cars racing across twisty highways, sexy girls populating clubs, minimal use of plot, and basically the worst acting you ever seen. Personally I didn't like Bow Wow's character too much. He seemed out of place in Tokyo and I'm not saying that just because he is not Asian. Bow Wow's character, Twinkie, seemed a little too...American for Japan. He had been living there longer than Sean, yet Sean some how managed to learn more Japanese than him. The only man that I feel saves the acting, possibly the whole movie, is Sung Kang. His character, Han, is so slick, cool, that you can even believe an actor this good signed on to this production.

The acting is fair but not everything works in the movie. The script is weak and at times I admit it's like you're not even watching a Fast and the Furious movie. It seems more like an after school special. Lucas Black gets in trouble for racing the older brother from Home Improvement. His mom then sends him to live with his father in Tokyo. His father warns him that if he goes near a car he'll kick him out. It's obvious from the start that Black isn't going to listen to those rules. Plus we know he actually won't ever get kicked out because if he's not with his dad then he'd have to settle for jail and then how would he be able to race or drift and then it would be no point in it being a Fast and the Furious movie. So that plotline is pretty pointless and proves to be pointles since in the end it..has no impact on it. The movie is mostly just about him learning to do a new form of racing to him called drifting. He damages each car he trys it in but of course you know he'll do better by the end.Lucas Black still fairs well here as a leading man but he doesn't have the screen presence of Vin Diesel or even Paul Walker. He's probably a better actor than Paul Walker. He went to a better acting school then the Keanu Reeves acting school that Walker went to I guess. Little ""or medium sized"" Bow Wow is also ok as Black's friend who doesn't race but sells things. This one has less sexy women and less hot cars than the previous ones. The direction is less flashy too. This one is just more juvenile and I can't say the Lucas Black character even changes, he goes there as a punk kid and basically just becomes... a wiser punk kid by the end.

644483,A34792YZU3EH56,B00005JP03,J. Swagman,"[8, 11]","Like many ""Japan Movies"" however, this is not a movie about Japan as much as Japan serving as an exotic location against which Westerners have their own adventures. There was a period around the turn of the century when most Western books and movies about Asia were simply exotic backdrops for stories about Europeans, and it appears 100 years later we are not completely out of that era yet.Not, I hasten to add before I get too high on my liberal horse, that there is anything inherently wrong with that. For that matter, Japanese media often employs the same device, and Japanese comics and movies are often filled with stories of Japanese people going to America and having all sorts of bizarre adventures.But it is noticeable that none of the main characters in this movie are Japanese. The hero is a white American, the best friend character is a black American, the mentor is a Chinese American, and the love interest is an Australian of indeterminate ethnicity. A multi-cultural cast certainly, but the rest of the Japanese characters are mostly reduced to the background. More is the pity because the producers were able to get a few of Japanese most recognized television talents to make cameos on this film, and then only gave them bit parts.In fact the only Japanese who figure into this story at all are the villains. I remember thinking the first film in the series, with its Chinese bad guys, was drifting dangerously close to reviving the old stereotype of the swarthy Asian villain. This film again has chosen to focus on a white protagonist battling slimy Asian gangs.However I am hesitant to call racism too quickly, especially since the director of this film and many of the crew are Asian American themselves. Instead, let us just say that the film has some unfortunate missed opportunities, and it could have been a lot better if it had done a better job of integrating its Japanese cast.As for my critique of the film's portrayal of Japan:The entire film is set in Tokyo, which I have thus far spent appalling little time in, despite my 5 years in Japan (mostly due to my hatred of crowds). Tokyo is to some extent almost a separate country, and the rest of Japan views it in much the same way we Midwesterners view California, as that crazy place where anything goes, fashion and youth culture are at their cutting edge, and nobody has any morals.If you watch the DVD, the director's commentary is pretty interesting, because he talks about some of the things he exaggerated, and some of the things he didn't. (For example, given the fact that Tokyo is one huge traffic Jam, most of these car racing scenes that take place in the movie are pretty laughable).Also it turns out that, like ""Lost in Translation"", this film was apparently plagued by Japan's restrictive rules regarding film permits, and a lot of the Tokyo footage they either had to take illegally, or film in L.A. on sets that recreated Tokyo.The school uniforms, school slippers, and look of the school was all pretty much dead on. However in my experience, a tall white guy cannot walk into a classroom in Japan without causing, if not massive disruption, at least a considerable show of interest and questions. I found it slightly surprising that he could simply walk into the classroom and be accepted as a new student, but then I live out in the countryside in Kyushu. I'm sure Tokyo is a lot more sophisticated and international.Of course, the big point of this movie is not Japan or the cast, but the cars.I will say this though, I now have a whole new appreciation for ""Crash"" by J.G. Ballard. When he I read his book about sexual eroticism and car crashes, I thought he was only being metaphorical about our society's addiction to automobiles. 15 minutes into this movie, I realized that some people, like the target audience for these films, do seem to literally equate huge car crashes with pretty girls and sexual arousal.",2,Missed Opportunity,1180224000,"05 27, 2007",2007,3922,"['many', 'Japan', 'Movies', 'however', 'not', 'movie', 'about', 'Japan', 'as', 'much', 'Japan', 'serving', 'exotic', 'location', 'Westerners', 'have', 'own', 'adventures', 'was', 'period', 'turn', 'century', 'when', 'most', 'Western', 'books', 'movies', 'Asia', 'were', 'simply', 'exotic', 'backdrops', 'stories', 'Europeans', '100', 'years', 'later', 'are', 'not', 'completely', 'era', 'yet.Not', 'hasten', 'add', 'get', 'too', 'high', 'liberal', 'horse', 'anything', 'inherently', 'wrong', 'matter', 'Japanese', 'media', 'often', 'same', 'device', 'Japanese', 'comics', 'movies', 'are', 'often', 'filled', 'stories', 'Japanese', 'people', 'going', 'America', 'having', 'sorts', 'bizarre', 'adventures.But', 'noticeable', 'none', 'main', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'Japanese', 'hero', 'white', 'American', 'best', 'friend', 'character', 'black', 'American', 'mentor', 'Chinese', 'American', 'love', 'interest', 'Australian', 'indeterminate', 'ethnicity', 'multi-cultural', 'cast', 'certainly', 'rest', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'are', 'mostly', 'reduced', 'background', 'More', 'pity', 'producers', 'were', 'able', 'get', 'few', 'Japanese', 'most', 'recognized', 'television', 'talents', 'make', 'cameos', 'film', 'then', 'only', 'gave', 'bit', 'parts.In', 'fact', 'only', 'Japanese', 'who', 'figure', 'story', 'are', 'villains', 'remember', 'thinking', 'first', 'film', 'series', 'Chinese', 'bad', 'guys', 'was', 'drifting', 'dangerously', 'close', 'reviving', 'old', 'stereotype', 'swarthy', 'Asian', 'villain', 'film', 'again', 'chosen', 'focus', 'white', 'protagonist', 'battling', 'slimy', 'Asian', 'gangs.However', 'am', 'hesitant', 'call', 'racism', 'too', 'quickly', 'especially', 'director', 'film', 'many', 'crew', 'are', 'Asian', 'American', 'Instead', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'film', 'unfortunate', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'had', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'integrating', 'Japanese', 'cast.As', 'critique', 'film', 'portrayal', 'Japan', 'entire', 'film', 'set', 'Tokyo', 'have', 'thus', 'far', 'spent', 'appalling', 'little', 'time', '5', 'years', 'Japan', 'mostly', 'due', 'hatred', 'crowds', 'Tokyo', 'extent', 'almost', 'separate', 'country', 'rest', 'Japan', 'views', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Midwesterners', 'view', 'California', 'crazy', 'place', 'where', 'anything', 'fashion', 'youth', 'culture', 'are', 'cutting', 'edge', 'nobody', 'morals.If', 'watch', 'DVD', 'director', 'commentary', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'things', 'exaggerated', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'example', 'given', 'fact', 'Tokyo', 'one', 'huge', 'traffic', 'Jam', 'most', 'car', 'racing', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'movie', 'are', 'pretty', 'laughable', '.Also', 'out', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'film', 'was', 'apparently', 'plagued', 'Japan', 'restrictive', 'rules', 'regarding', 'film', 'permits', 'lot', 'Tokyo', 'footage', 'had', 'take', 'illegally', 'film', 'L.A.', 'sets', 'recreated', 'Tokyo.The', 'school', 'uniforms', 'school', 'slippers', 'look', 'school', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'dead', 'However', 'experience', 'tall', 'white', 'guy', 'can', 'not', 'walk', 'classroom', 'Japan', 'causing', 'not', 'massive', 'disruption', 'least', 'considerable', 'show', 'interest', 'questions', 'found', 'slightly', 'surprising', 'could', 'simply', 'walk', 'classroom', 'be', 'accepted', 'new', 'student', 'then', 'live', 'out', 'countryside', 'Kyushu', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Tokyo', 'lot', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'international.Of', 'course', 'big', 'point', 'movie', 'not', 'Japan', 'cast', 'cars.I', 'will', 'say', 'now', 'have', 'whole', 'new', 'appreciation', 'Crash', 'J.G', 'Ballard', 'When', 'read', 'book', 'sexual', 'eroticism', 'car', 'crashes', 'thought', 'was', 'only', 'being', 'metaphorical', 'society', 'addiction', 'automobiles', '15', 'minutes', 'movie', 'realized', 'people', 'target', 'audience', 'films', 'do', 'seem', 'literally', 'equate', 'huge', 'car', 'crashes', 'pretty', 'girls', 'sexual', 'arousal']",The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift
644484,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00005JP03,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[1, 1]","Five years after ""The Fast and the Furious"" sped its way across the silver screen, the third installment in the franchise, ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"", raced its way into theaters. After two successful entries into a series that most didn't expect much out of to begin with, can this third iteration featuring an all-new cast, style of racing, and country gain enough traction to build upon the success of its predecessors or will it leave the series simply spinning its tires?""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" explores the illegal world of underground street racing in and around Tokyo, Japan. Unlike in the states, the primary style of racing over there is a much more difficult, and outrageous form known as drifting - where drivers' skills are put to the test as they must navigate hairpin turns at incredible rates of speed. Joining the ranks of these racers is a convicted racer from the United States named Sean (Lucas Black) whose parents had hoped he would be able to start a new life in this foreign land. However, when racing is at the core of your very being, it's hard to walk away when the temptation of high speeds is calling out to you.Even though I had seen the first two films in this series, I found myself with little to no interest in seeing this third one. The only reason I could come up with for this lack of confidence in the film, was because I thought the second one was a little weaker than the first, even though it at least featured one returning cast member (Paul Walker for those that don't recall) which garnered some favor; however for this film there appeared to be no original cast members returning from either of the previous films. So, in my opinion there didn't seem to be a whole lot of potential for ""Tokyo Drift"" to actually be all that good. Based on the box office results for this film, I felt that my estimation for the movie was fairly accurate, and I was pretty sure I wouldn't get around to watching it anytime soon, if ever for that matter. Then, there came along the recently released Blu-ray collection of the trilogy. Because I wanted to own the first two films on Blu-ray, and they were only available in a trilogy box set, I knew that I would end up with the third one anyhow. Which meant that since it was now in my possession, and I had already watched the other two, I may as well put this one into the player and see how it fares by comparison. Much to my surprise, ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" is actually a pretty good movie. Granted it's not as good as the first film, and is perhaps a little below ""2 Fast 2 Furious""; the film still did an admirable job of keeping me entertained to varying degrees from beginning to end.Written by newcomer to the series, Chris Morgan (""Wanted""), ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"", was a surprisingly well put together story, albeit with a few contrivances and convenient plot devices employed. I figured that if this series ever made it to a third movie it would most likely be tapped out in terms of story, unless they would be willing to resurrect some of the characters from the previous films and delve into them a bit more. However, I was wrong, because Chris Morgan wisely chose to shake things up dramatically to inject a new sense of life into a franchise that was running the risk of becoming stale in a hurry if the status quo remained intact. The inclusion of the new style of racing (which was incredibly fun to watch, especially for someone that hadn't really seen it done before), having not just a new city, but an all-new country as the backdrop for the action, and making it more of a fish out of water-esque story opened up several new doors for the series to walk through.Even though the story brought new energy to the series there were some problems that plagued the script along the way. For starters, the character of Twink (played by Bow Wow) seems to have an endless supply of goods which he sells to whoever has the desired amount of cash. This wouldn't be a trouble spot for me, except that Twink is merely a high school student, and by all accounts shouldn't have access to the amount of goods and services he has at his disposal. If the writer really wanted me to believe that Twink was capable of gaining access to all this stuff via stealing or whatever, then that is fine, but I believe that we should have seen this at some point within the story. Instead, his character came off as a little too unbelievable for my liking. Also, the whole plot point of sending Sean to Japan seemed like a big leap for me. Sure he's apparently gotten into a lot of trouble over in the U.S., but having his mom just give up and ship him over to his dad (who doesn't seem like he'll be all that good of an influence) seemed a little too convenient of a way to introduce us to the world of drifting. I know it was necessary to get the character over to Japan, but it could have been achieved within the story any number of ways, and most of them would have been more successful.The last problem within the story that I will discuss revolves around the drifting style of racing that the movie focuses upon. I appreciated that a new style was introduced (as I mentioned a moment ago); however, there seemed to be numerous times that the characters opted to drift (unnecessarily) rather than drive straight (as in the previous two films). This was especially evident during a car chase sequence where all the drivers were drifting around traffic and other miscellaneous obstructions, when if they had simply moved over slightly they could've just driven straight (or relatively straight), thus gaining more speed to outrun their pursuers. It was due to these weaknesses within the story that caused several lapses in believability, resulting in a somewhat diminished opinion for the film.Helming this third venture into the high-octane series is director Justin Lin (""Annapolis""). Lin brings a somewhat more grounded sense to this film than what was showcased in the previous film under the direction of John Singleton. The majority of the action seemed to be done using real cars, with little CGI enhancement being employed. The second film used plenty of real cars as well, but numerous sequences displayed obvious CGI usage in place of the real deal. With ""Tokyo Drift"", director Justin Lin appeared to stretch himself a bit more as a director, getting away from the straight-forward, generic camera style he used in his previous American film ""Annapolis"". For a movie such as ""Tokyo Drift"" to really fit in with the rest of the series, it requires that a little more flair be brought to the camera work, and Lin came through surprisingly well. He offered up a slick piece of American cinema that fits in perfectly with the tone and feel of the previous two films, while establishing the movie as a standalone entity within the franchise.The cast for this film was comprised of numerous young acting talents, some more capable than others at their craft, and based on most of the cast member's limited experience, I really didn't expect much out of them either. As you can see by now there were several factors that led to me viewing this film with rather low expectations. Anyways, leading the cast is actor Lucas Black (""Jarhead"") who gives a decent, although flawed performance as Sean. With a slight southern drawl, that is inconsistent in thickness throughout his entire performance, and a few instances where Lucas portrayed a somewhat down home country charm when attempting to woo the ladies, there weren't too many layers or points of interest to be found in his character. Truth be told, Lucas was probably the weakest cast member performance wise, showing nary a hint of emotion beyond a slight smirk or chuckle here and there, which does cause a bit of a problem due to the fact that his was the lead role.Thankfully, many of his supporting cast members were there to help mask his shortcomings as an actor. Rapper turned actor Bow Wow (formerly Lil' Bow Wow) has become quite the decent performer with roles ranging from TV appearances (""Smallville"") to several feature films (""The Johnson Family Vacation"" and ""Roll Bounce""). Out of all the roles I have seen him in, I think that his character of Twink in this film, is probably the most interesting, and likely the most fun to play. From his eccentric taste in cars (an Incredible Hulk themed car), to his penchant for finding virtually any and every possible good that his customers requested, almost nothing about Twink was normal. Even though his character pushes the limits of believability in places, Bow Wow does his level best to keep the character as grounded as possible, and delivers a solid performance in the process.Alongside Bow Wow was actor Sung Kang (""Live Free or Die Hard"") as Han, a talented drifter, who befriends and trains Sean in the ways of drifting. Sung created a very interesting character in Han, by having him be as much of an outcast among the Asian community of street racers as Sean was being an American in their midst. I liked the way Sung always played Han as if he longed for a way out of the illegal street racing world he almost seems trapped by, and the way he looks at his ""friends"" in that world shows a clear contempt for some of the actions they take in order to get ahead. His was a character that was all about honor both on and off the track, and out of all the cast he was probably the most interesting of characters on display.Aside from the three characters mentioned above, the remainder of the cast was relegated to either quasi-cameo appearances or merely one-dimensional antagonists. Most of the cast whether in a more developed role or not-so developed did a good job with their respective characters. Besides Lucas Black, who perhaps with acting classes could do much better work, the cast worked out very well, and managed to keep the movie's story interesting without relying solely on the racing to propel the film from start to finish.""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" was an energetic and fun ride that I'm sure introduced many of us to a new style of racing, but if you're like me you still preferred the other way instead. The film attempted to stand on its own as a movie without tying directly into what had come before it. In that respect, I feel that ""Tokyo Drift"" was a success of a movie; however, it sustained a much weaker box office than the previous two films, so perhaps this drastic of a change-up in a single installment wasn't the best of choices for this film's sake.As a side note, the title for this movie seemed a bit too long in my estimation; couldn't we have just stuck a number 3 on the end of the original title and called it a day? That's all I'm saying.""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",3,Get Ready For An All-New Style of Racing...,1239580800,"04 13, 2009",2009,10841,"['Five',

This movie was just plain stupid.  They should have kept this film story in the states.  Once everything moves over to Tokyo, the film plummets into inauthenticity the likes of which I haven't seen in a long time.  I would have respected the film 1,000 times more had it ended when the main character goes to Japan.So let's get this straight, Japanese high school students act like American high school students?  Lucas Black's character is simply told to go to a Japanese high school where he will simply pick up the language and make do?  Everybody speaks English ? His father lives in a tiny apartment yet has a garage that's about double the size of his apartment?I would have much preferred subtitles and a story that felt, looked and sounded more Japanese.  Japanese students are among some of the most polite students you will ever meet.  The Japanese culture is steeped and immersed in being respectful, polite and dutiful.  Real Japanese high school students would be embarassed by the way their culture was represented here.  Actually they probably wouldn't be embarassed, they would laugh at the film's poor attempt in showing true or even remotely true Japanese culture.  Japanese culture is not steeped in American hiphop and egocentric behavior and it's a pity so many Americans will see this film and actually think that Japanese students are just like American students.  There would be nothing further from the truth.  Japanese students do not act, look or sound like what was filmed here.  Not by a long shot.Given my dislike of how the Japanese culture was handled in this film, it left me finding the plot irrelevant.  The plot was OK but it would have been much better if they had either stuck to a more authentic representation of Japanese culture or kept the story in the states.",1,You've Got to be Kidding Me,1161388800,"10 21, 2006",2006,1913,"['movies', 'require', 'throw', 'out', 'disbelief', 'had', 'very', 'hard', 'time', 'doing', 'so', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'should', 'have', 'kept', 'film', 'story', 'states', 'Once', 'everything', 'moves', 'Tokyo', 'film', 'plummets', 'inauthenticity', 'likes', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'respected', 'film', '1,000', 'times', 'more', 'had', 'ended', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'Japan.So', 'let', 'get', 'straight', 'Japanese', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'act', 'American', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'character', 'simply', 'told', 'go', 'Japanese', 'high', 'school', 'where', 'will', 'simply', 'pick', 'up', 'language', 'make', 'do', 'Everybody', 'English', 'father', 'tiny', 'apartment', 'yet', 'garage', 'about', 'double', 'size', 'apartment', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'preferred', 'subtitles', 'story', 'felt', 'looked', 'sounded', 'more', 'Japanese', 'Japanese', 'students', 'are', 'most', 'polite', 'students', 'will', 'ever', 'meet', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'steeped', 'immersed', 'being', 'respectful', 'polite', 'dutiful', 'Real', 'Japanese', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'would', 'be', 'embarassed', 'way', 'culture', 'was', 'represented', 'here', 'Actually', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'embarassed', 'would', 'laugh', 'film', 'poor', 'attempt', 'showing', 'true', 'even', 'remotely', 'true', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'not', 'steeped', 'American', 'hiphop', 'egocentric', 'behavior', 'pity', 'so', 'many', 'Americans', 'will', 'see', 'film', 'actually', 'think', 'Japanese', 'students', 'are', 'just', 'American', 'students', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'further', 'truth', 'Japanese', 'students', 'do', 'not', 'act', 'look', 'sound', 'what', 'was', 'filmed', 'here', 'Not', 'long', 'shot.Given', 'dislike', 'how', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'was', 'handled', 'film', 'left', 'finding', 'plot', 'irrelevant', 'plot', 'was', 'OK', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'stuck', 'more', 'authentic', 'representation', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'kept', 'story', 'states']",The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift

644487,A3E5OY3YLZMOA9,B00005JP03,"Keith A. Jones ""Sonic Jones... I'm Kind Of A ...","[3, 4]","The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift is about a 17 year old kid named Sean played by Lucas Black. Sean loves cars and he loves to race them but it's too bad he can't get away from the police like Brian O'conner (Paul Walker) because he's already been caught twice and is on his way to a third strike. Sean ends up wrecking his car in a race against a high school jock who was racing to keep his girlfriend. Sean gets caught and instead of going to jail he goes to Tokyo to live with his father.What you have here in Tokyo Drift is a new beginning for The Fast and The Furious series. Vin Diesel is no Oscar winning actor but he made The Fast and the Furious good, you can't lie and say it doesn't need him. Since Diesel won't come back and even with help Paul Walker can't give the film what it needs why not change everything but still keep the idea of being Fast and Furious. The film seems to be trying to start something new just like the original film being the first of its kind. The only material I've been able to view Japanese drifting is in the anime Initial D and this film. Both show different views on the style of the people who drift in Japan. One similar thing is that everybody's cocky and sure of their skills and everyone lives and breathes drifting. I have to tell the truth because I truly think this film is up there with the first one, I'm not saying it's better but this nicely done and has an original story just like the first film.Although the cast may sound weak I had a little faith in Lucas Black and little faith in Bow Wow. Bow Wow is actually a talented actor and does a nice job supporting Lucas. One thing I hated was that the writers just had to add the hot girl that is in the middle of two guys. She has to choose between the guy she is supposed to love because his family saved her life and the new guy she's supposed to hate because he's an American. You think that people would get tired of that stuff by now, when will someone surprise me with something different. In the first Fast and the Furious it was Brian chasing Toretto's sister, in the second Brian was chasing Monica (Eva Mendes), and now you have Sean who's chasing Neela.I have plenty of positive things to say about this film. I really liked this story even though it was getting too close to being another one of those teen movies. I love the drifting and the way it was filmed; I had doubts about the whole drifting idea. I thought drifting would be fun to do but boring to watch and I was wrong because it was hot. The slowed down scenes to show just how close these cars come to hitting the wall and spinning out of control is amazing. What I loved most about this third film is that there is a perfect blend of action throughout the film. There's not too much talking and not enough action or too much action and not enough of a story. The city was beautiful, lots of lights, cool buildings, and plenty of color. The characters are all written well and actually have deep stories. There's not as much NOS used and not as much speed as the first two movies but this movie is still very exciting. I don't think I can stress enough on how great the drifting is and how beautiful the cars are. Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift is entertaining and hopefully there will be more from the series like this one.",4,Is It Worthy Of Being Called Fast & Furious,1161129600,"10 18, 2006",2006,3312,"['Fast', 'Furious', 'Tokyo', 'Drift', '17', 'year', 'old', 'kid', 'named', 'Sean', 'played', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'Sean', 'cars', 'race', 'too', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'away', 'police', 'Brian', ""O'conner"", 'Paul', 'Walker', 'already', 'been', 'caught', 'twice', 'way', 'third', 'strike', 'Sean', 'up', 'wrecking', 'car', 'race', 'high', 'school', 'jock', 'who', 'was', 'racing', 'keep', 'girlfriend', 'Sean', 'caught', 'instead', 'going', 'jail', 'Tokyo', 'live', 'father.What', 'have', 'here', 'Tokyo', 'Drift', 'new', 'beginning', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'series', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'actor', 'made', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lie', 'say', ""n't"", 'need', 'Diesel', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'even', 'help', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'film', 'what', 'why', 'not', 'change', 'everything', 'still', 'keep', 'idea', 'being', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'film', 'be', 'trying', 'start', 'something', 'new', 'just', 'original', 'film', 'being', 'first', 'kind', 'only', 'material', ""'ve"", 'been', 'able', 'view', 'Japanese', 'drifting', 'anime', 'Initial', 'D', 'film', 'show', 'different', 'views', 'style', 'people', 'who', 'drift', 'Japan', 'One', 'similar', 'thing', 'everybody', 'cocky', 'sure', 'skills', 'everyone', 'lives', 'breathes', 'drifting', 'have', 'tell', 'truth', 'truly', 'think', 'film', 'there', 'first', 'one', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'better', 'nicely', 'done', 'original', 'story', 'just', 'first', 'cast', 'may', 'sound', 'weak', 'had', 'little', 'faith', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'little', 'faith', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'actually', 'talented', 'actor', 'nice', 'job', 'supporting', 'Lucas', 'One', 'thing', 'hated', 'was', 'writers', 'just', 'had', 'add', 'hot', 'girl', 'middle', 'two', 'guys', 'choose', 'guy', 'supposed', 'love', 'family', 'saved', 'life', 'new', 'guy', 'supposed', 'hate', 'American', 'think', 'people', 'would', 'get', 'tired', 'stuff', 'now', 'when', 'will', 'someone', 'surprise', 'something', 'different', 'first', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'was', 'Brian', 'chasing', 'Toretto', 'sister', 'second', 'Brian', 'was', 'chasing', 'Monica', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'now', 'have', 'Sean', 'who', 'chasing', 'Neela.I', 'have', 'plenty', 'positive', 'things', 'say', 'film', 'really', 'liked', 'story', 'even', 'was', 'getting', 'too', 'close', 'being', 'one', 'teen', 'movies', 'love', 'drifting', 'way', 'was', 'filmed', 'had', 'doubts', 'whole', 'drifting', 'idea', 'thought', 'drifting', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'do', 'boring', 'watch', 'was', 'wrong', 'was', 'hot', 'slowed', 'down', 'scenes', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'close', 'cars', 'come', 'hitting', 'wall', 'spinning', 'control', 'amazing', 'What', 'loved', 'most', 'third', 'film', 'perfect', 'blend', 'action', 'film', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'talking', 'not', 'enough', 'action', 'too', 'much', 'action', 'not', 'enough', 'story', 'city', 'was', 'beautiful', 'lots', 'lights', 'cool', 'buildings', 'plenty', 'color', 'characters', 'are', 'written', 'well', 'actually', 'have', 'deep', 'stories', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'NOS', 'used', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'speed', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'movie', 'still', 'very', 'exciting', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'stress', 'enough', 'how', 'great', 'drifting', 'how', 'beautiful', 'cars', 'are', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'Tokyo', 'Drift', 'entertaining', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'series', 'one']",The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift

The conditions of the move are that he stay away from cars and stay out of trouble, otherwise he'll be sent back to America and go to jail. So of course his first day in school Sean winds up racing the nephew of a member of the Japanese mafia over a girl he has no business talking to. Pretty soon Sean is racing every day and learning how to ""drift"" a style of driving that involves sharp turns and dangerous curves. With tons of car racing, dangerous men involved in illegal activities, and a beautiful girl caught between the bad boy and the clueless outsider, 3 Fast 3 Furious is indeed a wild ride.I liked both of the previous Fast and the Furious movies, so I thought I would like this one. It was okay, but not great. Sean's pathetic attempt at a Southern accent was hard to tolerate and a disgrace to genuine Southerners. Bow Wow's role as the funny guy who can't help but get into trouble was one of the more redeeming parts of the film along with the character of Han, who takes Sean under his wing and teaches him to drift. Overall, this movie was okay. It's pretty entertaining and fast-paced, but it's nowhere near as good as the other movies in the series.",3,AKA 3 Fast 3 Furious,1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,1303,"['getting', 'involved', 'car', 'accident', 'racing', 'school', 'jock', 'Southern', 'Sean', 'Boswell', 'sent', 'live', 'father', 'Tokyo', 'conditions', 'move', 'are', 'stay', 'away', 'cars', 'stay', 'trouble', 'otherwise', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sent', 'back', 'America', 'go', 'jail', 'course', 'first', 'day', 'school', 'Sean', 'up', 'racing', 'nephew', 'member', 'Japanese', 'mafia', 'girl', 'business', 'talking', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'Sean', 'racing', 'day', 'learning', 'how', 'drift', 'style', 'driving', 'sharp', 'turns', 'dangerous', 'curves', 'tons', 'car', 'racing', 'dangerous', 'men', 'involved', 'illegal', 'activities', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'caught', 'bad', 'boy', 'clueless', 'outsider', '3', 'Fast', '3', 'Furious', 'indeed', 'wild', 'ride.I', 'liked', 'previous', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'movies', 'thought', 'would', 'like', 'one', 'was', 'okay', 'not', 'great', 'Sean', 'pathetic', 'attempt', 'Southern', 'accent', 'was', 'hard', 'tolerate', 'disgrace', 'genuine', 'Southerners', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'role', 'funny', 'guy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'trouble', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'redeeming', 'parts', 'film', 'character', 'Han', 'who', 'Sean', 'wing', 'drift', 'Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'okay', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'fast-paced', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'movies', 'series']",The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift

Lots of great action, and I just flat get a kick out of watching drift cars doing their thing (these ridiculous ""Drift Comps"" are stupid and boring.

Yakuza are ruthless and lethal in the way they do business. The Yakuza seem to be near-bumbling fools in ""Tokyo Drift"". It was likewise nice to see ""Konishiki"" in the bathhouse sequence (he was one of America's premiere Sumo Wrestlers in Japan, back in the late 80's).Lucas Black has come a ways from his ""Sling Blade"" role some years back. He plays culture shock well.

I enjoy a good action-packed car movie at least as much as some but I feel impelled to write a review to balance out the unbelievable, nonsensical reviews that have come before.  While I'll agree that this movie is better than FNF2 it is nowhere near the original and it is a shame that this is another dud in what might have become a great franchise.It is unbelievable from the casting of 20(30)-year-olds to play the part of teenagers to the non-Japanese Asians hired to play Japanese characters to the basic premise that high-school students are able to hold driver's licenses in the first place.  This is not the Japan that I know at all and doesn't feel like it or look like it either - contrary to what another reviewer posted.The acting was wooden and the dialogue inane even though the characters were visually appealing.  The thing that made FNF1 a classic in the genre is that it was not only filled with hot cars and hot bodies but there was also a story that tied it all together.  This morality play is what made it worth watching - again, hot bodies and hot cars aside.  The subsequent FNF2 and FNF3 have lacked the story that brought us to the series.It seems producers forgot that and instead focused only on the visual aspects and none of the cerebral ones.  It's a shame because this could have been a much better movie than it was.  I wanted to love this movie but to give it a rating of 4 or 5 stars would be to make a total mockery of the rating system.I hope there is a Fast and Furious 4 but I hope the producers spend more time and money on the story than they have the past 2 attempts.

644511,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B00005JP03,Mike Zimmerman,"[4, 7]","Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) is a bad boy who keeps moving from town to town every time he gets in trouble. After racing against bully schoolmate Clay (Zachary Ty Brian) and getting in a fight with him, the police recommend that he move to Tokyo with his father (Brian Goodman) to learn some lessons. His father prohibits him from driving, but after meeting smooth-talking hustler Twinkie (Bow Wow), he enters the world of drift racing that goes around Tokyo. One of the reigning champions of the sport goes by the nickname D.K. (Brian-Tee). Little does he know that D.K. has ties to the Yakuza crime syndicate, and after losing a race, he is forced to pay off the debt of his loss by venturing into the deadly realm of the Tokyo underworld, where the stakes are life and death. And it doesn't help matters that he starts dating D.K.'s girlfriend Neela (Nathalie Kelly).If one thing's for certain, every installment of ""The Fast & The Furious"" is known for several things: cardboard acting, bare-bones plot, and tense racing scenes. For the first two movies, Paul Walker was the lead, and in every movie, he had to go undercover as a gangsta street racer taking down a syndicate. Sure, those movies weren't really deep, but with a good sense of humor to back up the implausibility, no one cared. Those movies made buck.Well, now that Paul Walker has left, along with Tyrese Gibson and Vin Diesel (or does he?), the latest installment switches gears for a new type of ball game. Instead of an undercover cop, we got a brat going mano-y-mano against the Yakuza. Justin Lin (""Better Luck Tomorrow"") is, of course, leading the franchise to a new direction trying to add some bones to the franchise, but with the original producers of the franchise - Amanda Cohen (sister of director Rob Cohen, or so I think) and Neal H. Moritz - involved, it's pretty much the same deal. But that does NOT mean there's some fun to be had.Obviously, as soon as the intro and credits (for the first time) kick in, you get that feeling that you're not seeing a Oscar-winning hit here. It's your basic popcorn-munching alternative to the summer when other movies are playing. For this installment of ""F&F;,"" the budgets has gone smaller, but the ingredients are still there: CG-rendered cars racing across twisty highways, sexy girls populating clubs, minimal use of plot, and basically the worst acting you ever seen.Too bad some of the action sequences aren't really exciting. While Lin does want to ramp up the absurdity (but not too much, because Sean is not the best drifter) for the sake of fun, it ain't much to write home about. There's quite a lot of shaky camera views, super-quick close-ups, and other stylish tricks to ramp up speed. It works for the second half, but I suggest for part 4 (if there ever will be one) that CG-rendered cars should be removed for real cars.And I don't really like the acting that much. Lin is obviously directing the trials and tribulations of Sean Boswell. But not only does Lucas Black (of ""Friday Night Lights"" fame) come off as a bad impersonation of Paul Walker with a hillbilly accent, but the producers prohibit some shade of character development. They even have Twinkie, played to comic relief by Bow Wow, own various types of bling and Lebron James shoes. The star power is small, except for Sonny Chiba and - in a cameo - Vin Diesel. Maybe it's a good idea, because doesn't the franchise cater to teenagers and adrenaline-fueled junkies?There are other questionable aspects: bizarre music played in background (""Bawitdaba"" and a couple of tracks that sound like they came out of ""Dance Dance Revolution"") is one of my main beefs. But Lin has managed to save any creative energy for the last two race scenes which actually bring out some tension that was missing in the beginning. ""The Fast & The Furious: Tokyo Drift"" is still a far cry from a reinvention, but baby steps nevertheless.",2,"""My mother is blind in one eye and she can shift better than that.""",1164412800,"11 25, 2006",2006,3913,"['Sean', 'Boswell', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'bad', 'boy', 'who', 'moving', 'town', 'town', 'time', 'trouble', 'racing', 'bully', 'schoolmate', 'Clay', 'Zachary', 'Ty', 'Brian', 'getting', 'fight', 'police', 'recommend', 'move', 'Tokyo', 'father', 'Brian', 'Goodman', 'learn', 'lessons', 'father', 'driving', 'meeting', 'smooth-talking', 'hustler', 'Twinkie', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'world', 'drift', 'racing', 'around', 'Tokyo', 'One', 'reigning', 'champions', 'sport', 'nickname', 'D.K', 'Brian-Tee', 'Little', 'know', 'D.K', 'ties', 'Yakuza', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'losing', 'race', 'forced', 'pay', 'off', 'debt', 'loss', 'venturing', 'deadly', 'realm', 'Tokyo', 'underworld', 'where', 'stakes', 'are', 'life', 'death', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'dating', 'D.K', 'girlfriend', 'Neela', 'Nathalie', 'Kelly', '.If', 'one', 'thing', 'certain', 'installment', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'known', 'several', 'things', 'cardboard', 'acting', 'bare-bones', 'plot', 'tense', 'racing', 'scenes', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'was', 'lead', 'movie', 'had', 'go', 'undercover', 'gangsta', 'street', 'racer', 'taking', 'down', 'syndicate', 'Sure', 'movies', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'deep', 'good', 'sense', 'humor', 'back', 'up', 'implausibility', 'one', 'cared', 'movies', 'made', 'buck.Well', 'now', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'left', 'Tyrese', 'Gibson', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'latest', 'installment', 'switches', 'gears', 'new', 'type', 'ball', 'game', 'Instead', 'undercover', 'cop', 'got', 'brat', 'going', 'mano-y-mano', 'Yakuza', 'Justin', 'Lin', 'Better', 'Luck', 'Tomorrow', 'course', 'leading', 'franchise', 'new', 'direction', 'trying', 'add', 'bones', 'franchise', 'original', 'producers', 'franchise', 'Amanda', 'Cohen', 'sister', 'director', 'Rob', 'Cohen', 'so', 'think', 'Neal', 'H.', 'Moritz', 'involved', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'deal', 'NOT', 'mean', 'fun', 'be', 'had.Obviously', 'as', 'soon', 'intro', 'credits', 'first', 'time', 'kick', 'get', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'not', 'seeing', 'Oscar-winning', 'hit', 'here', 'basic', 'popcorn-munching', 'alternative', 'summer', 'when', 'other', 'movies', 'are', 'playing', 'installment', 'F', 'F', 'budgets', 'gone', 'smaller', 'ingredients', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'CG-rendered', 'cars', 'racing', 'twisty', 'highways', 'sexy', 'girls', 'populating', 'clubs', 'minimal', 'use', 'plot', 'basically', 'worst', 'acting', 'ever', 'seen.Too', 'bad', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'exciting', 'Lin', 'want', 'ramp', 'up', 'absurdity', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'Sean', 'not', 'best', 'drifter', 'sake', 'fun', 'ai', ""n't"", 'much', 'write', 'home', 'quite', 'lot', 'shaky', 'camera', 'views', 'super-quick', 'close-ups', 'other', 'stylish', 'tricks', 'ramp', 'up', 'speed', 'second', 'half', 'suggest', 'part', '4', 'ever', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'CG-rendered', 'cars', 'should', 'be', 'removed', 'real', 'cars.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'acting', 'much', 'Lin', 'obviously', 'directing', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'Sean', 'Boswell', 'not', 'only', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'fame', 'come', 'off', 'bad', 'impersonation', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'hillbilly', 'accent', 'producers', 'prohibit', 'shade', 'character', 'development', 'even', 'have', 'Twinkie', 'played', 'comic', 'relief', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'own', 'various', 'types', 'bling', 'Lebron', 'James', 'shoes', 'star', 'power', 'small', 'Sonny', 'Chiba', 'cameo', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'Maybe', 'good', 'idea', ""n't"", 'franchise', 'cater', 'teenagers', 'adrenaline-fueled', 'junkies', 'are', 'other', 'questionable', 'aspects', 'bizarre', 'music', 'played', 'background', 'Bawitdaba', 'couple', 'tracks', 'sound', 'came', 'Dance', 'Dance', 'Revolution', 'one', 'main', 'beefs', 'Lin', 'managed', 'save', 'creative', 'energy', 'last', 'two', 'race', 'scenes', 'actually', 'bring', 'out', 'tension', 'was', 'missing', 'beginning', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'Tokyo', 'Drift', 'still', 'far', 'cry', 'reinvention', 'baby', 'steps', 'nevertheless']",The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift

Ok so a you cocky American reject comes to Japan to live with his Navy father because of troubles with the law in the U.S. Tell me if this makes sense to any of you reading this: he's a high school kid, he go's to the Japanese high school with Japanese kids, he gets an invite to see some drifting & one of the guys at the drift meet lets him borrow his car to race the drift king after he insults this guy while trying to pick up the guys girlfriend. All of this seems to go down in the first couple days of the guy arriving in Japan. So during the course of the movie, he learns the art of drifting & then races the guy who beat him at the start of the movie again to pay off a debt & also takes his girlfriend in the process. So let me tell you what was wrong with this movie, EVERYTHING!-The Japanese guys girlfriend was a typical bimbo who's just hangin out with this dude until something better comes along, our hero the American high school kid, she was in love with the guy the minute she laid eyes on him, no loyalty to her boyfriend who at that point had done everything for her.-Our main character attends a Japanse High School, now I've lived on mainland Japan & Okinawa a combined 6 years & I have never seen any American kids going to any Japanese schools other than the ones who's military fathers married local Japanese women & those are the hybrid kids who speak english & Japanese fluently.-For the final race, they took a busted Mustang that belonged to the main characters father & rebuilt it with a Nissan S15 engine as the power plant. Now if you are a true American who loves muscle cars then this should've been the biggest insult of all. You DO NOT take one of Henry's cars & drop a Japanese motor in it...The good thing about the movie was that in the end it came down to broken trust between two friends & it was not about the main female character even though I think the female character was under the impression that it was about her it good it wasn't. But it did end with this high school kid as the so-called new drift king of Tokyo which in itself was pretty insulting to the hardcore Japanese drifters. They take what they do pretty seriously and there's no way they would let some young underage upstart come in like that and make them all look bad.

I cannot believe that the director Justin Lin has never been to Japan before (as he said in the interview) while was able to pull off such a accurate depiction of the distinctive characteristic of Tokyo. Of course there are exaggerations; no movie can be exciting without it. It is the direction of exaggeration that matters, which is suprisingly accurate in this movie. As opposed to what another review here argues, it is not unrealistic to live in ""rabbit hutch"" while work in a garage for fixing cars, I have seen similar garage in downtown Tokyo. I have also seen American kids wearing uniform and go to japanese high schools; there are many US military bases near Tokyo. The rivalry between right wing yakuza and Korean descendents (Han) is also a deeply rooted part of Japanese society. The use of famous Japanese TV personalities in this movie deserves an applause.However, it IS ridiculous to have capsule hotel in Han's garage and so on.Having moved to US after graduating from college in Japan, I enjoyed this movie because it gave me a fresh look back at where I spent my insecure adolescent years.

644539,A3Q1FVG9D6VFPK,B00005JP03,"Summer S. Wilson ""Collectonian""","[6, 7]","The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift isn't a deep, thought provoking movie, but it doesn't purport to be either.  It's just what it was marketed in trailers to be: an action packed fun bit of mind candy filled with fast cars, dozens upon dozens of hot Japanese girls, thumping music, and body flinching car crashes.  The basic plot is that a high school driving nut gets in trouble (yet again) after racing with a rich boy.  To keep him out of jail, he is sent to his estranged father in Japan.  Alas, there he discovers the world of drifting, an even more dangerous style of racing.  Unfortunately, he also soon finds himself in trouble with the relative of a high ranking Yakuza.For me, the only really noticeable mistake in this movie is that way too many people walked away with only a few scratches from what should have been fatal crashes.  For example, there is one crash where a car rams into a concrete tube while going at least 80 mph.  Yet the two occupants didn't even require a hospital bed!  A more minor mistake might have been putting in a little too much plot, especially when some things weren't followed up as well as they could have.  In the end, though, the plot is mostly there to serve as some spacer between all the hot cars and awesome races.  I should mention one other minor mistake.  Vin Diesel's cameo was so completely pointless.  The movie already had a good ending, it was just kinda senseless.The cars in this movie are the real stars.  So many hot little numbers, including American muscle cars, hot foreign vehicles, and one pimped out van that you just have to see to believe.  The acting is good, for what it is, though Luca Black's twang-filled voice might annoy some folks.  Twinkie, another army brat played by Bow Wow, is such a hoot!  I know I said the plot was mostly spacer, but I did find the interaction between Sean, Han, and Twinkie to be awesome.So I suggest you don't think about the logistics of things.  Just sit back and enjoy the cars, the some times over-the-top characters, and, for the men (or lesbians) the multitude of Japanese girls who barely wear any clothes. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed seeing this movie.

644548,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B00005JP03,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[16, 23]","What can I say?  The original ""Fast and the Furious"" was sort of ridiculous, but did make a mark in the modern genre of action movies that involve decked/tricked out cars. ""2 Fast, 2 Furious"" was a lackluster sequel, but at least there was a conduit from the first movie with Paul Walker starring in it.  But this movie, ""Tokyo Drift"" was the most holistic form of cinematic crap I have seen in a long, long time.The plot is that an American teenager Sean, played by Lucas Black (who has a southern accent that sounds so fake, yet in reality it isn't) is sent to live with his father in Tokyo.  This happens after he again breaks the law for racing and wrecking cars after a languid day of high school.  So he moves to Tokyo so he can be reformed, have a better attitude, bring his grades up and stay away from fast cars.  Nevertheless, this instigator of plot never really seems to be addressed or resolved.  The fact that Sean had no friends or family anywhere else closer than Tokyo still seems dubious.  Any who, Sean is up to his old tricks again with cars faster than you can say ""Goodyear"" once he moves in with daddy.As for this 105 minute (which felt much longer) bowel movement in still life had many interesting elements.  For instance, I found it so interesting that all the Japanese students pretty much treat their native tongue like a second language and English as a first.  Also every Japanese teenage girl that has an interest in cars is unbelievably sexy and hot.  The only fashion and music in Tokyo is hip hop.  It appears that none of these Japanese teenagers work, but their cars cost more that some of the projects NASA funds.  Japanese mob members seem to have too much interest in teenage activities.  Also the technique of ""drifting"" displayed in this movie is physically impossible to perform with a car, unless your car is created by Q (from the James Bond films).  It is also pretty safe to say there is more computer graphics in this movie than a Pixar/Disney film.Bow Wow?  Bow Wow?  Bow Wow?  Bow Wow? Bow Why? What in the world was the point of him in this movie?  All he did was produce comic relief, that wasn't funny at all and sell knockoff/bootleg sneakers and iPods.  His presence could have been removed and it wouldn't have influenced the frail plot that was sadly placed.  Also why did Vin Diesel agree to be in this movie, but refused to be in ""2 Fast 2 Furious""?  Not that ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" was great, but it was an Oscar winner compared to ""Tokyo Drift"".  It isn't like Vin Diesel is some true thespian actor, just watch XXX, so why didn't he include himself in these movies some more.  After all didn't the ""Fast and the Furious"" really introduce Vin to mainstream American audiences?  I guess being in a sequel is beneath Vin.  As for Vin Diesel's cameo, he looked like the make-up crew got a little jiggy with the Max Factor or something, because Vin looked like a woman.In conclusion, if you want to laugh at a poor attempt to cash in to this franchise, watch ""Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"".  It really is entertaining, but not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination.  In contrast, there is one of the most creative but ridiculous plug ins/product placements I have ever seen in a movie.  The item is Tabasco sauce and it is thrown in the most outrageous, idiotic, and lame and ""you have got to be kidding me"" situations I have ever seen in a movie.

Just wait for the ending.Until then, you have to foloow the film's silliest story patiently. In order to avoid a jail sentence, a disgraced son Sean (Lukas Black) is sent to Tokyo where his father lives. In spite of his strict father's advice, Sean gets hooked up with the yakuza (Japanese mafia) there after a car race. Now every Japanese viewer would find the story not only incredible but laughable, for no yakuza, which is tightly organized group, would ever hire an American high school kid as debt collector (it is illegal and too conspicuous)But that is not the point, I know, and this film is not made as documentary film. The real selling points of `The Fast and the Furious; Tokyo Drift' is the glittering vista of neon-lit city of Tokyo, and `drifting' or unique style of driving, deliberately skidding your car when turning around a corner. The car stunts are mostly thrilling (mostly meaning when not using special effects), showing the great skills of the stunt drivers.My three stars all go to these professionals, not the actors. The film doesn't need to be a Shakespeare, but still some of the players here show atrocious acting that is simply unacceptable. The boys are handsome but cannot move a single muscle of their face, and the ladies are beautiful but they all look so wooden.(By the way, some Japanese audiences hated the film because of its casting. Except for Sonny JJ Chiba, most of the main `Japanese' characters are played by Asian-American actors, not Japanese actors. Probably Non-Japanese viewers would not mind it, but Taiwanese-born director Justine Lin should have known that we (I mean, Asians) are sometimes very sensitive to the issue.)All in all, it is a mindless OK film just like two other `Fast and the Furious' films.If you like this film and drift racing, try `Initial D.'",3,Drift Racing In Tokyo: Silly But Mindless Fun,1158624000,"09 19, 2006",2006,1945,"['real', 'surprise', 'third', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'film', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'know', 'should', 'not', 'write', 'who', 'Just', 'wait', 'ending.Until', 'then', 'have', 'foloow', 'film', 'silliest', 'story', 'patiently', 'order', 'avoid', 'jail', 'sentence', 'disgraced', 'son', 'Sean', 'Lukas', 'Black', 'sent', 'Tokyo', 'where', 'father', 'lives', 'spite', 'strict', 'father', 'advice', 'Sean', 'hooked', 'up', 'yakuza', 'Japanese', 'mafia', 'there', 'car', 'race', 'Now', 'Japanese', 'viewer', 'would', 'find', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'incredible', 'laughable', 'yakuza', 'tightly', 'organized', 'group', 'would', 'ever', 'hire', 'American', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'debt', 'collector', 'illegal', 'too', 'conspicuous', 'not', 'point', 'know', 'film', 'not', 'made', 'documentary', 'film', 'real', 'selling', 'points', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'Tokyo', 'Drift', 'glittering', 'vista', 'neon-lit', 'city', 'Tokyo', 'drifting', 'unique', 'style', 'driving', 'deliberately', 'skidding', 'car', 'when', 'turning', 'around', 'corner', 'car', 'stunts', 'are', 'mostly', 'thrilling', 'mostly', 'meaning', 'when', 'not', 'using', 'special', 'effects', 'showing', 'great', 'skills', 'stunt', 'drivers.My', 'three', 'stars', 'go', 'professionals', 'not', 'actors', 'film', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'Shakespeare', 'still', 'players', 'here', 'show', 'atrocious', 'acting', 'simply', 'unacceptable', 'boys', 'are', 'handsome', 'can', 'not', 'move', 'single', 'muscle', 'face', 'ladies', 'are', 'beautiful', 'look', 'so', 'wooden', 'way', 'Japanese', 'audiences', 'hated', 'film', 'casting', 'Sonny', 'JJ', 'Chiba', 'most', 'main', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'Asian-American', 'actors', 'not', 'Japanese', 'actors', 'Probably', 'Non-Japanese', 'viewers', 'would', 'not', 'mind', 'Taiwanese-born', 'director', 'Justine', 'Lin', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'mean', 'Asians', 'are', 'sometimes', 'very', 'sensitive', 'issue', 'mindless', 'OK', 'film', 'just', 'two', 'other', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'films.If', 'film', 'drift', 'racing', 'try', 'Initial', 'D']",The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift

If these are your thing, and you want some mindless action and entertainment, you might like this movie. I imagine The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, might be best enjoyed after drinking a 6 pack of Mountain Dew.In this Story, Sean Boswell goes to Tokyo to live with his military uncle. He soon becomes involved with drift racing. Sean loses a race to someone tied with the Japan style mafia, the Yakuza. It is here that the meat of the story really begins.With so many good popcorn movies out at this time, I don't see this movie picking up much steam. Everything about it is average and forgettable. I would wait until it comes out on DVD, unless you are a hardcore racing fan, or in need of mindless entertainment (I mean that in a good way).Total Score (out of 100) = 3321 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.4 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?4 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?3 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?1 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?0 (out of 10).
