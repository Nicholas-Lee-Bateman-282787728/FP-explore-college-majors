One would think the subject matter would seem dated today but due to the excellent writing, and heartwarming, emmy-worthy acting all around, every episode is just as relevant today.It is so refreshing to see a show done for quality and not to just be the best cop show or beat others in the ratings.  To bring Meredith Baxter into season 2 as Nancy was the smartest choice. (Season 1 was actually an extended mini series.) She gave Nancy such depth and brought her to life.  Her scenes with the truly gifted Sada Thompson are pure acting revelations.  They are both two of the best dramatic actresses ever.And add in Kristy mcNichol, who had rare maturity for someone her age and also an acting range that puts todays people to shame.It is too bad that a show makes you long for when tv was done merely to provide quality, which this show does in spades.

1003427,A1IWR4FKPGE95C,B000GFRI68,Carlos Rodriguez,"[11, 11]","FAMILY, was one of the best (if not the best) dramatic series on Television during its triumphant run in the 1970's. The show dealt with many serious issues that the Lawrence family from Pasadena, California dealt with magnificently well. Although the series initially was supposed to have a short lifespan as a midseason replacement for another show,it quickly found an audience and became incredibly popular that the producers made it a permanent weekly attraction. The show enjoyed an unparalled success mainly to the superb performances from its gifted cast. When Family first premiered on March 9, 1976, I was 10 years old and I quickly became infatuated (like most boys my age) with the innocence, charm and sweetness of Kristy McNichol. I became a huge fan of this gifted and talented actress that I would watch the show every week just because she was in it. I decorated my bedrooms walls with every poster and magazine article that I could find about her from the popular teen magazines of the day like Teen Beat, 16 and Tigerbeat. Kristy, (Buddy Lawrence on the show) stole my heart and during my formative teen years she was an idol of mine. I'm very happy that they finally put this amazing and groundbreaking series out on DVD, it was about time and I know that there are many people out there who grew up in the 70's like I did that feel the same way. Now that the first and second seasons have been finally released (in this beautiful box set which contains the first 28 episodes from seasons I & II, I hope that they will release the remaining episodes of seasons III and IV on DVD as well. I don't remember how many seasons that show was on but it had a remarkable run from 1976-1980. The picture and sound quality of the show is outstanding and I'm glad that I'm able to go back and relive a period in my life when everything was more simple and less complicated. To who ever thought of the genius idea to release this legendary dramatic series on video I thank you and all of us who loved this beautiful show thank you. Now I can watch Family anytime that I want and I can show my kids what a great show this was and I can smile and think back to when I had a huge crush on Kristy McNichol, one of the hottest and most talented teen idols of her day.",5,Thank God is finally on DVD,1159660800,"10 1, 2006",2006,2269,"['FAMILY', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'not', 'best', 'dramatic', 'series', 'Television', 'triumphant', 'run', '1970', 'show', 'dealt', 'many', 'serious', 'issues', 'Lawrence', 'family', 'Pasadena', 'California', 'dealt', 'magnificently', 'well', 'series', 'initially', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'short', 'lifespan', 'midseason', 'replacement', 'show', 'quickly', 'found', 'audience', 'became', 'incredibly', 'popular', 'producers', 'made', 'permanent', 'weekly', 'attraction', 'show', 'enjoyed', 'unparalled', 'success', 'mainly', 'superb', 'gifted', 'cast', 'When', 'Family', 'first', 'premiered', 'March', '9', '1976', 'was', '10', 'years', 'old', 'quickly', 'became', 'infatuated', 'most', 'boys', 'age', 'innocence', 'charm', 'sweetness', 'Kristy', 'McNichol', 'became', 'huge', 'fan', 'gifted', 'talented', 'actress', 'would', 'watch', 'show', 'week', 'just', 'was', 'decorated', 'bedrooms', 'walls', 'poster', 'magazine', 'article', 'could', 'find', 'popular', 'teen', 'magazines', 'day', 'Teen', 'Beat', '16', 'Tigerbeat', 'Kristy', 'Buddy', 'Lawrence', 'show', 'stole', 'heart', 'formative', 'teen', 'years', 'was', 'idol', 'mine', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'finally', 'put', 'amazing', 'groundbreaking', 'series', 'DVD', 'was', 'time', 'know', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'grew', 'up', '70', 'did', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'Now', 'first', 'second', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 'finally', 'released', 'beautiful', 'box', 'set', 'first', '28', 'episodes', 'seasons', 'II', 'hope', 'will', 'release', 'remaining', 'episodes', 'seasons', 'III', 'IV', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'how', 'many', 'seasons', 'show', 'was', 'had', 'remarkable', 'run', '1976-1980', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'show', 'outstanding', ""'m"", 'glad', ""'m"", 'able', 'go', 'back', 'relive', 'period', 'life', 'when', 'everything', 'was', 'more', 'simple', 'less', 'complicated', 'who', 'ever', 'thought', 'genius', 'idea', 'release', 'legendary', 'dramatic', 'series', 'video', 'thank', 'who', 'loved', 'beautiful', 'show', 'thank', 'Now', 'can', 'watch', 'Family', 'want', 'can', 'show', 'kids', 'what', 'great', 'show', 'was', 'can', 'smile', 'think', 'back', 'when', 'had', 'huge', 'crush', 'Kristy', 'McNichol', 'one', 'hottest', 'most', 'talented', 'teen', 'idols', 'day']",Family - The Complete First and Second Seasons

First, Kristy McNichol is the most adorable woman I've ever seen on television, extremely talented and it was all her natural acting ability.This thoughtful program was considered ground breaking for its time as a form of reality television, dealing with real life sensitive issues previous television tried to cover-up. In fact, this was Aaron Spelling's favorite production of the hundreds of series he created in his lifetime. This program was Aaron Spelling's pride and joy and justifiably so. It had some real depth, was full of true caring, love and emotions, less contrived then other programs of its day.Matthew Broderick's (Ferris Beuller's Day Off) father played as the father. Sada Thompson and the rest of the cast are excellent. Kristy McNichol was the biggest star of the program and went on after receiving two Emmys to establish new heights for teen actress movie contracts. Kristy McNichol was the first to get a movie contract for what was back then a dizzying $1,000,000 (1980).This program may seem too boring for today's audience, but those of us who grew up back then really appreciate the value it gave to help us through hard times with our dysfunctional, careless, abusive parents.",5,Highly Therapuetic and Hypnotic,1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,1295,"['program', 'brain', 'waves', 'neuron', 'connections', 'healing', 'many', 'ways', 'First', 'Kristy', 'McNichol', 'most', 'adorable', 'woman', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'television', 'extremely', 'talented', 'was', 'natural', 'acting', 'ability.This', 'thoughtful', 'program', 'was', 'considered', 'ground', 'breaking', 'time', 'form', 'reality', 'television', 'dealing', 'real', 'life', 'sensitive', 'issues', 'previous', 'television', 'tried', 'cover-up', 'fact', 'was', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', 'favorite', 'production', 'hundreds', 'series', 'created', 'lifetime', 'program', 'was', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', 'pride', 'joy', 'justifiably', 'so', 'had', 'real', 'depth', 'was', 'full', 'true', 'caring', 'love', 'emotions', 'less', 'contrived', 'then', 'other', 'programs', 'day.Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Ferris', 'Beuller', 'Day', 'Off', 'father', 'played', 'father', 'Sada', 'Thompson', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'excellent', 'Kristy', 'McNichol', 'was', 'biggest', 'star', 'program', 'went', 'receiving', 'two', 'Emmys', 'establish', 'new', 'heights', 'teen', 'actress', 'movie', 'contracts', 'Kristy', 'McNichol', 'was', 'first', 'get', 'movie', 'contract', 'what', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'dizzying', '1,000,000', '1980', '.This', 'program', 'may', 'seem', 'too', 'boring', 'today', 'audience', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'back', 'then', 'really', 'appreciate', 'value', 'gave', 'help', 'hard', 'times', 'dysfunctional', 'careless', 'abusive', 'parents']",Family - The Complete First and Second Seasons

I watched this duriing its first run & it was one of the few shows that I was allowed to see at such a late hour (10 PM).  It shifted throughout its run to earlier formats, but due to some of its controversial themes, the series was initially put in a later time slot than the typical family viewing hour.There's so much to love about Family.  Sada Thompson was always elegant & graceful as Kate, the matriarch.  James Broderick was so down-to-earth & good natured, he was warming as the Lawrence patriarch.  Kristy McNichol was lovable as Buddy & made you wish you had a friend like her in real-life.  Gary Frank as Willie was carefree & made you wish you had Willie as a brother or even as a boyfriend.  He had all of the fine qualities a grounded woman seeks in a man.  Was really cute as well.I implore anyone who has never seen this show to buy this set, as well as longtime fans, such as myself who watched it as a child.Family was critically acclaimed as a result of its frank depiction of love & relationships.

I love this show, and my heart sank when I read another reviewer's post that his DVD's were suffering from DVD Rot. I checked mine and, lo and behold, they are degrading as well!!! Luckily, unlike with some other people who are experiencing this, mine still work, so I am making a backup copy of my set and I urge you to check yours and back them up too before you lose them.  The DVD's seem to not be available anymore and this may be the reason, so before you lose this gorgeous show, back it up!!  To report your DVD rot issues to SONY, you can do so here: consumer@SPHECustomerSupport.sony.comWhat follows is my original review.  It is five star because I am reviewing the show, not SONY:Family holds as true and charming as it always has, and one cannot help but truly feel as one of the family while watching it.  When the DVD season's 1 & 2 came to an end, I really missed the Lawrence's!  I love watching some TV on DVD, but this one I truly hated to see end as I approached the last DVD on the set.I have always loved this show and I must confess was a bit in shock when I found out it was to be released on DVD.  I never thought I'd see the day, but always hoped.  I mean, they released `Punky Brewster' for crying out loud, why not Family?!  I was also a bit worried that, at the last moment, the DVD release might be canceled or delayed (can we say `Once and Again'?)  But, lo and behold, it WAS released on schedule and., I might add, wonderfully remastered!While a few episodes show their age on some short scenes, the overall quality of these DVD's episode mastering is gorgeous.  I had the episodes on tape, which I recorded while on syndication, all horribly chopped up.  Now, watching these episodes in their glorious entirety, beautiful colour and sound...what else could I add except: PLEASE release seasons 3, 4 and 5!NEWS:  No news.  Does that say it all?  SONY has not yet announced another season release.  Yes, they are usualy slow (check their track record), and maybe I have been burnt by corporations like Buena Vista, who left thousands hanging for 'Once and Again' season three (we are still hangning, by the way, years later).  Maybe we can start a petition on [...]?  Notice that SONY Home Entertainment does not even care to hear from you.  There is no contact info on their site.  Maybe that says it all as well?",5,WARNING: DVD ROT!!!

1003434,A1FDW1SPYKB354,B000GFRI68,David Von Pein,"[43, 45]","I just finished watching the Pilot episode of ""Family"" via this nice-looking 6-Disc DVD set containing Seasons 1 and 2 of the series. I've seen many of these episodes previously, but I don't recall ever having seen the Pilot program, which co-stars Elayne Heilveil in the part of ""Nancy"" (she was later replaced by Meredith Baxter-Birney). You may recall Heilveil co-starring opposite David Janssen in a pretty good 1973 TV-Movie called ""Birds Of Prey"" (which is also available on DVD).The Pilot episode for ""Family"" is simply wonderful, perfectly introducing us to the Lawrence ""family"". I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this Pilot. Everybody in the cast, from Sada Thompson right on down the line, is just perfect. I'd recommend this Pilot (and this DVD set) to anyone who enjoys family-type dramas. The Pilot episode was filmed in late 1975, and was originally telecast on March 9th, 1976.There are a few very funny moments in the Pilot show too, especially when an angry Doug (James Broderick) screams at Willie (Gary Frank) after the family learns that 13-year-old Buddy (Kristy McNichol) has taken the car out for a spin -- ""Willie, you stay here and try to figure out how you can possibly have an I.Q. of 140 and not use ANY of it!!"" ~LOL~ (You see, Willie has secretly been giving Buddy driving lessons. And the fact that Willie has recently dropped out of school doesn't exactly help to make dad any happier with young William either.)The ""Family"" Pilot features the burgeoning acting talent of an extremely young-looking (and future Emmy-winning) Miss McNichol, who gives a spot-on performance in the series' premiere as ""Buddy"", a girl who has her own set of problems to deal with -- e.g., she's being called ""Shrimp-o"" at school; she's upset at being the shortest (and flattest) girl in her class; she gets quite an earful while eavesdropping on her parents' argument; and she ends up in a police car before this Pilot reaches its conclusion (that ""driving without a license"" thing, remember).It was quite a debut show for Kristy indeed. And she pulls it off like a veteran. A remarkable actress. (But she had already co-starred in one TV series prior to ""Family"" -- a short-lived drama called ""Apple's Way"", which lasted for 28 episodes in 1974 and '75.)This DVD collection of six single-sided discs gathers together the short 6-episode first season of ""Family"" and the entire 22-program second season, for a total of 28 hour-long shows (the episodes run for about 49 to 50 minutes on the DVDs).The video and audio look and sound mighty good here too. Colors aren't super-saturated, but I'll bet the PQ here is every bit as good as when these shows first aired on ABC-TV in 1976 and 1977.""Family"" appeared on network television for five seasons (86 total episodes), from 1976 to June of 1980. Aaron Spelling and Mike Nichols were two of the creative forces who brought this intelligently-written and well-acted drama into American homes for those five TV seasons.Upon digging a little into the background of this series, I was surprised to learn that some of the original music for ""Family"" was credited to Pete Rugolo and John Rubinstein. (Rubinstein, who composed the low-key musical themes for the Pilot broadcast, played Nancy's husband ""Jeff Maitland"" in various episodes throughout the series; while Rugolo's signature trademark, as far as I'm concerned, will forever be his one-of-a-kind music that he created for the 1960s TV series ""The Fugitive"".)I also have learned that at least one episode of ""Family"" was directed by actress Joanne Woodward. I hadn't realized that tidbit of information either, prior to preparing this review. So, the ""Family"" talent runs deep, both in front of the camera and behind it.""Family"" gets its very first home-video release of any kind with the September 5, 2006, arrival of this DVD set from SPHE (Sony Pictures Home Entertainment). There aren't any bonus features within this set, but the quality of the episodes themselves makes this collection more than worthwhile.Video is presented in its proper TV ratio (1.33:1 Full-Frame). The audio is in Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono. There are no subtitles, but English Closed-Captioning can be accessed if you've got a caption-capable television.Packaging for this 6-DVD set comes in the form of three slim cases which slide into an outer cardboard carton (each of the plastic cases holds two DVDs).I look forward to additional ""Family"" seasons reaching the DVD market in the future (knock wood). I'm sure that other fans of the show are hoping that the remaining seasons are released on DVD too. Because once you've taken a look at this series' dandy premiere episode, you're bound to want to see more of a ""Family"" named Lawrence.",5,"Watch The Pilot Episode -- It's Guaranteed To Get You

1003435,A1FZOLPMDKX24B,B000GFRI68,Douglas Allen,"[12, 12]","I have been buying DVDs of old VHS tapes of this show from Ebay for awhile now and I am amazed at how well this show holds up. From the directors who worked on ""thirtysomething"" this stuff is top notch. The scripts are incredibly sensitive (especially the first few shows from the first season, like the episode ""Thursday's Child"" where the family tries to make peace with the death of their youngest, Timmy, while preparing for Nancy's newborn's Chirstening is heartwrenching and more real than most ""reality"" television I have seen in the past few years.) The acting is nothing less than superb. Although I am a big fan of Kristy McNichol and she turns in many great performances here, it is Sada Thompson as Kate Lawrence that really offers viewing magic with a really rich and full presence onscreen; she gives such reality and weight to her role. This is just great, quality television; completely satisfying.I can only hope that extras include comentary by the cast, especially Kristy McNichol!The first two season's episodes are as follows (in order of airdate, but numbered by production order):1st Season (Spring 1976)0.

This was a groundbreaking show for it's time ('76-'80), yet it still exhibited the cohesiveness of the average middle-class family through it's struggles, triumphs and tragedies. The creative forces coupled with the fine acting made this show a true masterpiece. While a somewhat simliar program ""Eight is Enough"" that I liked would run from 1977-81, Family was still my favorite.I watched as much of this show as I could when it aired until the time it ended. It was simple in it's presentation, yet addressed a broad range of comtemporary issues that other shows were not as bold to breach during that period.If this show were fast forwarded to today, I could imagine Kate scoffing at dinner-table texting, lol.I haven't watched re-runs in years, but saw some clips on YouTube recently and it brought back a lot of memories. I intend to get the DVDs soon.I remember having a crush on Kristy then and IMO, I always believed had she left Familiy before it's run, the show wouldn't have lasted as long as it did. It is a shame she has left the industry, but I admire her for wanting to play the biggest part of her life, which is Kristy. While I would welcome her return, I wish her well no matter what.Family also laid the ground for many other dramatic and successful shows that would grace both the TV and pop culture such as Dallas, Knots Landing and Falcon Crest from the late 70s and into the '80s.If you haven't watched Family yet, then do yourself a huge favor and see this heartwarming show.",5,Remarkable!,1292198400,"12 13, 2010",2010,1627,"['were', 'fan', 'familiar', 'Kristy', 'McNichol', ""'70s"", ""'80s"", 'part', '90s', 'then', ""'m"", 'sure', 'knew', 'Family', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'show', 'time', ""'76-'80"", 'still', 'exhibited', 'cohesiveness', 'average', 'middle-class', 'family', 'struggles', 'triumphs', 'tragedies', 'creative', 'forces', 'coupled', 'fine', 'acting', 'made', 'show', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'somewhat', 'simliar', 'program', 'Eight', 'Enough', 'liked', 'would', 'run', '1977-81', 'Family', 'was', 'still', 'favorite.I', 'watched', 'much', 'show', 'could', 'when', 'aired', 'time', 'ended', 'was', 'simple', 'presentation', 'yet', 'addressed', 'broad', 'range', 'comtemporary', 'issues', 'other', 'shows', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'bold', 'breach', 'period.If', 'show', 'were', 'fast', 'forwarded', 'today', 'could', 'imagine', 'Kate', 'scoffing', 'dinner-table', 'texting', 'lol.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 're-runs', 'years', 'saw', 'clips', 'YouTube', 'recently', 'brought', 'back', 'lot', 'memories', 'intend', 'get', 'DVDs', 'soon.I', 'remember', 'having', 'crush', 'Kristy', 'then', 'IMO', 'always', 'believed', 'had', 'left', 'Familiy', 'run', 'show', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'lasted', 'as', 'long', 'did', 'shame', 'left', 'industry', 'admire', 'wanting', 'play', 'biggest', 'part', 'life', 'Kristy', 'would', 'welcome', 'return', 'wish', 'well', 'matter', 'what.Family', 'also', 'laid', 'ground', 'many', 'other', 'dramatic', 'successful', 'shows', 'would', 'grace', 'TV', 'pop', 'culture', 'such', 'Dallas', 'Knots', 'Landing', 'Falcon', 'Crest', 'late', '70s', ""'80s.If"", 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'Family', 'yet', 'then', 'do', 'huge', 'favor', 'see', 'heartwarming', 'show']",Family - The Complete First and Second Seasons

Although Doug is an attorney, they seem unduly worried about their finances.  Willie's hair is pretty goofy looking - I am appalled that I used to have a little crush on him.  In spite of these quibbles, I love the show and am hooked all over again.Buddy is entrancing, one of the best characters in the history of TV.  Buddy and Nancy are both timeless characters.  The poster who called Kate ""aristocratic"" is right on the money - she acts a little superior to everyone else, IMO.  Occasionally Buddy gets her to loosen up a little.  The writing is good, the acting is elegant, and I get choked up at least once every episode.I am intrigued by the fact that Amazon features Mary Grace Canfield as the star.

1003469,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B000GFRI68,Westley,"[6, 6]","I was only 6 years old when ""Family"" debuted; my mom adored it.  To my older siblings, it was one of the most boring things on television, and they protested loudly if my mom tried to watch it.  So my mom only watched ""Family"" when just she and I were home.  I remember that every episode seemed to be about weighty adult issues and was so talky.  UGH!  I just wanted to watch cartoons.As an adult, I often enjoy weighty dramas, so I decided to try the first two seasons of ""Family"" on DVD.  Not surprisingly I had a very different reaction this time.  ""Family"" focuses on the Lawrence family of Pasadena, California.  Doug (James Broderick) is a successful attorney married for 25 years to Kate (Tony winner Sada Thompson).  The oldest child, Nancy (Meredith Baxter Birney) is a young newlywed with an infant (Timmy).  Willie (Gary Frank) has dropped out of high school and does little but hang around the house.  Finally, Buddy (Kristy McNichol) is a young teen tomboy struggling to find who she is.  The family lives in a terrific older house with rambling stairs that was passed down from Doug's father.The Lawrences are an idealized family of sorts, but they also have problems.  During the first season, Nancy catches her husband cheating, and they soon divorce.  Likewise, the family frequently argues and has communication break downs.  However, in the end, they stick together and support each other.  I love the warmth between the family members; it sometimes threatens to become sticky sweet but remains realistic.  They're the kind of family many people wish they could have.  In particular, Sada Thompson is superb as the mother.  She is the perfect parent - warm and encouraging yet tough when she needs to be.Like many 70s dramas, ""Family"" tends to be limited by its episodic nature.  Most episodes present a new problem that is more or less tidily wrapped up by the time the end credits run.  Too often, the storylines depend on a relative or an old friend from out of town reappearing and involving the family in some kind of drama.  So one week Willie's old friend who is wanted by the FBI drops into town and nearly gets Willie arrested, and the next week an old flame woos Nancy until she finds out he has a drug problem.  It just doesn't seem that realistic that an average family has this many old friends and relatives with problems who just happen to show up each week.  Today's television dramas do a much better job of creating storyline arcs that last several episodes and therefore seem more realistic.  However, this is a relatively minor quibble about what is otherwise an excellent drama.  I think ""Family"" will appeal to fans of other 70s family dramas, such as ""Eight is Enough.""The first season of ""Family"" was presented as a miniseries; this set contains Seasons 1 and 2 - a total of 28 episodes.  The DVD set includes no extras.

1003471,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B000GFRI68,William Timothy Lukeman,"[157, 160]","Who would have thought that this quality show would ever be released on DVD? Thankfully someone realized that there's still an audience craving intelligent, heartfelt, humanistic drama!What strikes me upon watching these episodes again after so many years is the superb writing & acting. These are smart, articulate people, living in a more civilized culture than exists in America today. They're also flawed in very human ways, capable of deeply wounding & being wounded, but always ready to take the path of reconciliation & understanding. It's a family that expects more from itself than the lowest common denominator ... and the show is wise enough to acknowledge that such a laudable & worthwhile goal may sometimes have its drawbacks.Kate was warm but a touch aristocratic, obviously the driving force in the family dynamic. She could be infuriating at times, heartbreaking at others, both in her relationship with Doug & with her children. Nancy could be spoiled, Doug stubborn, Willie a little too carefree in his approach to life, Buddy simply struggling to grow up -- but all were basically admirable, striving to grow & embrace life, rather than hide from it. They took chances, for all the comforts of their cozy home; they were hurt at times, made foolish choices, found unexpected rewards. Not an idealized family, but a very desirable one!This was very much a writer's show -- the dialogue is sharp, witty, poignant, laced with warmth & humor when needed, often summing up a complex situation with a pithy phrase. Some younger viewers might complain that people don't really talk like that. Perhaps they don't, at least not these days. But again, the writing aspired to more than the barely sufficient. It makes you appreciate language & how it can be used.But the writing is only half of it -- without fine acting, the best writing in the world falls flat. Luckily the show was blessed with subtle, quietly powerful actors, who could express a wealth of emotion in the inflection of a single word, or a brief glance. Despite the time-specific backdrop & references, this is truly a timeless family, experiencing & responding to all the trials & joys that life brings.So here's hoping the subsequent seasons are released as well! We need more quality viewing, just to remind people that there's more to life than ""reality"" shows, spoiled celebrities, and the crass & the vapid (which ought to be the title of half the shows currently on TV).

We used to watch so many quality shows those days - others being ""Little House on the Family"", ""Eight is Enough"" [which is yet to be released on DVD], ""The Waltons"" and many more.When I look back, the themes covered in ""Family"" were rather radical for its time - adultery, divorce, homosexuality, drug addiction etc. And all this in a regular suburban family, the Lawrence's in America comprising attorney dad Doug[James Broderick], stay-at-home mother Kate[Sada Thompson], eldest daughter Nancy[played by Elayne Heilveil in Season 1 and Meredith Baxter-Birney in Season 2], high-school dropout son Willie[Gary Frank], and teen daughter Buddy[Kristy McNichol].The writing is intelligent and economical, and the acting by all cast members is above average, especially by Sada Thompson as the stalwart mom. There are even familiar names amongst the guest stars such as Tommy Lee Jones, Helen Hunt, James Woods etc.There's plenty of heart in ""Family"" and the stories manage to strike a chord in viewers even after all these years. It's rare to find such quality family-centered shows on TV these days and I'm so glad this show is out on DVD. I hope ""Eight is Enough"" will be released on DVD too.",5,An excellent family-centered show with intelligent writing and great casting!,1242518400,"05 17, 2009",2009,1327,"['was', 'just', 'kid', 'when', 'Family', 'was', 'shown', 'TV', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'sitting', 'family', 'dinner', 'watching', 'show', 'used', 'watch', 'so', 'many', 'quality', 'shows', 'days', 'others', 'being', 'Little', 'House', 'Family', 'Eight', 'Enough', '[', 'yet', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', ']', 'Waltons', 'many', 'more.When', 'look', 'back', 'themes', 'covered', 'Family', 'were', 'rather', 'radical', 'time', 'adultery', 'divorce', 'homosexuality', 'drug', 'addiction', 'etc', 'regular', 'suburban', 'family', 'Lawrence', 'America', 'comprising', 'attorney', 'dad', 'Doug', '[', 'James', 'Broderick', ']', 'stay-at-home', 'mother', 'Kate', '[', 'Sada', 'Thompson', ']', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Nancy', '[', 'played', 'Elayne', 'Heilveil', 'Season', '1', 'Meredith', 'Baxter-Birney', 'Season', '2', ']', 'high-school', 'dropout', 'son', 'Willie', '[', 'Gary', 'Frank', ']', 'teen', 'daughter', 'Buddy', '[', 'Kristy', 'McNichol', ']', '.The', 'writing', 'intelligent', 'economical', 'acting', 'cast', 'members', 'above', 'average', 'especially', 'Sada', 'Thompson', 'stalwart', 'mom', 'are', 'even', 'familiar', 'names', 'amongst', 'guest', 'stars', 'such', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'James', 'Woods', 'plenty', 'heart', 'Family', 'stories', 'manage', 'strike', 'chord', 'viewers', 'even', 'years', 'rare', 'find', 'such', 'quality', 'family-centered', 'shows', 'TV', 'days', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'show', 'out', 'DVD', 'hope', 'Eight', 'Enough', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'too']",Family - The Complete First and Second Seasons
