365287,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6303236685,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","Escape from Sobibor, 1987 filmIn 1942 Himmler built the extermination camps that were sited in eastern Poland: Treblinka, Belzec, and Sobibor (unpopulated areas of pine trees). In October 1943 the prisoners in Sobibor revolted and escaped, the greatest during WW II. Those who had a trade were saved for labor, the others went to the death chambers. The story shows how some who tried to escape (without a plan) were shot. The others are lined up along the railroad tracks to greet new prisoners with smiling faces. They arrive in freight cars. ""Hard work is good for your soul."" [Do those who give this advice follow it?] Those will skills are selected. The new arrivals are separated into two groups: women and children, and men and boys. The rest are taken to the showers, a building set apart from the others. One woman volunteers to care for the rabbits and chickens.One man plans an escape and looks for allies. The SS men talk about their lives. We see the horrors of people lined up to enter the ""showers"". Survival is the way to revenge. Those who break the rules are punished severely. A load of Dutch prisoners arrive. Some dance for entertainment. During work two prisoners try to escape while fetching water from a stream. Others run off, but they are caught. They will all be killed after choosing another prisoner to die with them! The planned escape must allow all six hundred so no one is left behind for reprisals. Is that possible? New prisoners arrive, they are captured Soviet soldiers to do heavy labor. Their lieutenant talks to them. We see how lunch is served. They discuss the plan but must be careful. Sasha meets Luka. The SS must be killed first to neutralized the armed guards.This must be done one by one in secret. One man can make many knives. One kapo is brought to a shed and silenced. They plan the details. It will happen after 4pm. ""It begins."" One by one the enemy are killed. Will there be a hitch in the plans? They will make it work. The bugle sounds roll call and people assemble. But an event pushes up the escape. People rush for the gate. Shots are fired, people fall. The barbed wire fence is cut. People flee to the woods, their only hope of escape. Some set off the mines. Some are shot before they reach the woods. But over 300 survived. They tell what happened to these and what they did afterwards. This camp was destroyed and obliterated by the Nazis. There is a postwar monument among the pine trees.This was filmed on location in Belgrade Yugoslavia. It was based on Thomas Blatt's manuscript ""From the Ashes of Sobibor"" and Stanislaw Szmajzner's ""Inferno Sobibor"". Years ago I read ""A Man Called Intrepid"". The Allies knew about those death camps but didn't popularize this knowledge.

The film does not try to skip over certain normal human reactions among the Jewish people. A good educational tool for those who may gloss over this horrible time in human history. Alan Arkin emoting attempted calmness in the face of utter tragedy is strangely understandable (and well done). The store bought dvd I have is sort of thrown together.

365293,A6833RMCXTKLZ,6303236685,Augustine  Invictus,"[0, 0]","I obtained this movie from my father's wide collection of movies. Sobibor is in eastern Poland. An extermination camp was built there primarily for Jewish people gathered from parts of Europe such as Poland, the Netherlands, Russia, etc. On arrival, those selected for labor are separated from those that were to be immediately killed by gassing or otherwise, men, women and children.Those selected for labor are to be exterminated later on. What was horrifying for me and my friends were the scenes such as the arrival of a train in Sobibor. To deceive the doomed people, the Nazis begin to play that beautiful Strauss Waltz ""Tale from the Vienna Woods"" and to see some of the unsuspecting children swaying their bodies to the rythym of the music was just heartbreaking. The roles played by the American actor (Alan Arkin)  as a leader of the concentration camp inmates and the German actor ( Rutger Hauer) as a Jewish Russian prisoner of war were just extremely commendable. However, everyone including the acting of the German Nazi Officers,their subordinates and their prisoners who played certain roles in the movie, was so impressive that the Director of this movie did an excellent job in our opinion.If you watch this movie, be prepared to be exposed to the wanton cruelty of the German SS Nazi officers and the callousness of their just as cruel Ukrainian SS Guards. What is very disheartening is the fact that this is a true account : how cruel can a human being be to his fellow human. Therefore, a planned  escape from this Camp of Hell was very desirable.

There is some nudity seen from a distance. There is very little foul language; and there is no gore. There is violence and deaths. My estimate is that this movie would be rated PG-13.To learn about the story, please read the Amazon description and other reviews.Regarding the 143 minute version... (uncut, extended, original)All of the many DVD varieties sold on Amazon are the 119 minute version.  If you see a listing on Amazon that says 143 minutes, then you should email the merchant to verify the length of the movie BEFORE you purchase it (that's what I did, plus I checked the UPC against other websites).One review dated September 15, 2012 said they got the Granada (or Grenada) Ventures version, and it was the longer version.  But that company doesn't exist anymore.  And I emailed that reviewer, but didn't hear back from them regarding where they purchased that version (since there is no listing on Amazon).There are a couple of websites that have the 119 minute version that you can watch online for free.  Apparently, this movie is in the public domain.I did learn that the 143 minute version is unique to Europe, specifically the United Kingdom.I was able to purchase the 143 minute version from an eBay merchant named public_domain_movies.  They are based in the UK.  They burned the movie (using NTSC format) onto a DVD and shipped it to me in a paper sleeve.  It cost 7 bucks including shipping; I placed my order Dec 12 and received it Dec 26.  And the movie/DVD transfer was much better than the copy that I rented from Netflix.Currently, public_domain_movies doesn't have any listings (probably taking time-off for Christmas). However, you could search for that user name on eBay and email them for info (go to eBay, at the bottom click ""site map"", then click ""find a member"").So, what's the difference between the 119 and 143 minute versions? I watched the 119 minute version originally, but haven't watched the 143 minute version yet. However, check-out the two reviews on Amazon that do list some of the differences: one is dated October 27, 1999 and the other is dated August 23, 2000.If you want to buy the 119 minute version, then consider buying the DVD published by TGG  (or TGG Direct, or TGG/Diamond):Escape from Sobibor. One review dated March 30, 2012 stated that the movie transfer for this version was better than most.Visit my Amazon Collections to see my 4-star and 5-star military/war DVDs:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections",5,excellent WWII drama about the Sobibor death camp (and where I got the 143 minute version),1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,2579,"['acting', 'realistic', 'cinematography', 'well', 'done', 'dialogue', 'believable', 'nudity', 'seen', 'distance', 'very', 'little', 'foul', 'language', 'gore', 'violence', 'deaths', 'estimate', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'rated', 'PG-13.To', 'learn', 'story', 'please', 'read', 'Amazon', 'description', 'other', 'reviews.Regarding', '143', 'minute', 'version', 'uncut', 'extended', 'original', 'many', 'DVD', 'varieties', 'sold', 'Amazon', 'are', '119', 'minute', 'version', 'see', 'listing', 'Amazon', '143', 'minutes', 'then', 'should', 'email', 'merchant', 'verify', 'length', 'movie', 'purchase', 'what', 'did', 'checked', 'UPC', 'other', 'websites', '.One', 'review', 'dated', 'September', '15', '2012', 'said', 'got', 'Granada', 'Grenada', 'version', 'was', 'longer', 'version', 'company', ""n't"", 'exist', 'anymore', 'emailed', 'reviewer', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'back', 'regarding', 'where', 'purchased', 'version', 'listing', 'Amazon', 'are', 'couple', 'websites', 'have', '119', 'minute', 'version', 'can', 'watch', 'online', 'free', 'Apparently', 'movie', 'public', 'domain.I', 'did', 'learn', '143', 'minute', 'version', 'unique', 'Europe', 'specifically', 'United', 'Kingdom.I', 'was', 'able', 'purchase', '143', 'minute', 'version', 'eBay', 'merchant', 'named', 'public_domain_movies', 'are', 'based', 'UK', 'burned', 'movie', 'using', 'NTSC', 'format', 'DVD', 'shipped', 'paper', 'sleeve', 'cost', '7', 'bucks', 'including', 'shipping', 'placed', 'order', 'Dec', '12', 'received', 'Dec', '26', 'movie/DVD', 'transfer', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'copy', 'rented', 'Netflix.Currently', 'public_domain_movies', ""n't"", 'have', 'listings', 'probably', 'taking', 'time-off', 'Christmas', 'However', 'could', 'search', 'user', 'name', 'eBay', 'email', 'info', 'go', 'eBay', 'bottom', 'click', 'site', 'map', 'then', 'click', 'find', 'member', '.So', 'what', 'difference', '119', '143', 'minute', 'versions', 'watched', '119', 'minute', 'version', 'originally', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', '143', 'minute', 'version', 'yet', 'However', 'check-out', 'two', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'do', 'list', 'differences', 'one', 'dated', 'October', '27', '1999', 'other', 'dated', 'August', '23', '2000.If', 'want', 'buy', '119', 'minute', 'version', 'then', 'consider', 'buying', 'DVD', 'published', 'TGG', 'TGG', 'Direct', 'TGG/Diamond', 'Escape', 'Sobibor', 'One', 'review', 'dated', 'March', '30', '2012', 'stated', 'movie', 'transfer', 'version', 'was', 'better', 'most.Visit', 'Amazon', 'Collections', 'see', '4-star', '5-star', 'military/war', 'DVDs', 'http', '//www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections']",Escape From Sobibor VHS

Those are good books and good movies, but one that doesn't get the recognition it deserves is a great movie entitled Escape From Sobibor with Alan Arkin and Rutger Hauer about the only documented escape from a concentration camp in World War 2.  The thing that is most incredible about this powerful movie is that it's true!  Not that Night or Schindler's List are not true stories, but Escape from Sobibor ends on a very powerful and uplifting note in which most to all of the Jews (those who want to at least) who can escape do escape!  Now they don't all survive and some were recaptured (and most likely killed) but many, many Jews survived, and not only that, many of them got to kill their SS Oppressors as well!  How powerful is that!  This was shown on T.V. and I showed it to my six year old son and twelve year old daughter.  The subject matter is definitely PG but I wouldn't rate it higher than that even though the subject matter is so intense with horrifying scenes depicted continuously throughout the movie, but the truth is, these stories need to be told.

365334,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,6303236685,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[1, 2]","Based on the true story of an uprising in one of the Polish death camps in which over 300 prisoners escaped during WWII. Leon Feldhendler(played by Alan Arkin), the Jewish leader of the camp, is trying to figure out how to get everybody out of the camp (rather than just a few) when Russian Jewish soldiers are brought to the camp. He makes an alliance with their leader, Alexander Pechersky (played by Rutger Hauer), and what transpires is a gritty means of escape that puts ""The Great Escape"" to shame. Joanna Pacula stars as Luca, the pretty love interest, who might be best known to Americans as the love interest of Doc Holliday in ""Tombstone"".The tale is gruesome and horrifying (even by 1980s standards) but there's enough determination and hope that you don't get depressed to the point where you want to give up and turn the DVD off. Alan Arkin is close to superb as the Jewish leader who points out the obvious futility in trying just any means of escape and waiting for the opportune moment where just not a few but all of the camp can get out. As to be expected it isn't a cake walk and of course there are surprises but it's well developed and does an admirable job (unlike many other films) of trying to stay true to what really happened at Sobibor.Life of the characters are revealed at the end. Over 1.25M Jews were killed in this death camp. Close to 300 prisoners escaped. Something that would never happen in another death camp during WWII. Shortly after the escape the camp was pulled down and grown over in the hopes that nobody would remember it.Based on a novel of a similar title by Richard Rashke. Camp survivor Thomas Blatt served as a technical consultant. Trivia below. After watching this again I need to compare it to the oh so mighty ""Schindler's List"". Some have complained of the DVD quality but I don't feel that should factor into the grade of this fine film. This is graded from a 1980s standard when technology was less sophisticated.STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B plus to A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus; TONE/HOLOCAUST FOCUSES: A minus to A; OVERALL GRADE: A minus; WHEN WATCHED: 2002 (third viewing and review in early July 2012).TRIVIA/SOME SPOILERS: there were two other uprisings at Auschwitz and Treblinka. In actuality 300 did escape but most of them were recovered. Only a fraction of them evaded their pursuers. Roughly 50. Hauer's character truly did plan the revolt with a few others and was not recaptured historically. German SS were actually assassinated to confuse the rest of the guards. According to one person interviewed on the History channel (who had been at the camp) people truly did run over the corpses of the fallen to avoid setting off mines.MORE SPOILERS: the desperate run through the minefield as they were being shot at was one of the most memorable moments. Creepy when the SS played classical music to make the new Jewish prisoners feel they were in something other than a death camp. Nice scene where the SS guy trying his boots out spotted the axe and moved away in time. Not all of them could be clueless idiots around people who clearly hated them.

True, the stroy is compelling and important enough, but the way filmmaker Spielberg brings it to the screen, with an avalanche of rather cheap gadges like bombastic music, self-indulgend camerawork, melodramatic subplots and a range of over-acting, make for a film that drowns halfway in form. And this is a sad thing, especially for an important movie like this, which tackles the most horrific events in modern history.The director and his technical crew should have taken a few steps backward and let the dramatic events speak for themselves, for they are dramatic enough.Two movies with the Holocaust as background which are to me great examples of how it could and should be done are the made-for-tv ""Escape from Sobibor"" and a tiny, unknown Polish film called ""Korczak"", made by veteran director Andrej Wajda and the even so veteran cameraman Robby M?ller. Both are stand-out artists whose presence in this movie goes almost unnoticed.The story is what counts here and all technical matters are there just to `observe' the happennings, brought by the script, rather that emphasize it (and hereby over-do it, like in the Spielberg thing). The result is a great tale told in a small and sober way. The effect is enormous.The same can be said about the just mentionned ""Escape from Sobibor"".It tells the based-on-facts tale of the big escape from deathcamp Sobibor. Alan Arkin, who is perfectly cast as the face of `any ordinary man' witnesses the cruelty in the camp and slowly comes to realise that escape, how sheer impossible it might seem, is the only chance of survival.However the movie doesn't concentrate on one leading person, but is more of a mosaic of characters who are forced to do extraordinary things in horrible circumstances.No `straining after effects', but just an arresting tale extremely well told and with a sense of reality that is almost unmatched.",5,How a Holocaust movie should be,1137024000,"01 12, 2006",2006,1937,"['never', 'understood', 'immense', 'praise', 'Schindler', 'list', 'True', 'stroy', 'compelling', 'important', 'enough', 'way', 'filmmaker', 'Spielberg', 'screen', 'avalanche', 'rather', 'cheap', 'gadges', 'bombastic', 'music', 'self-indulgend', 'camerawork', 'melodramatic', 'subplots', 'range', 'over-acting', 'make', 'film', 'halfway', 'form', 'sad', 'thing', 'especially', 'important', 'movie', 'most', 'horrific', 'events', 'modern', 'history.The', 'director', 'technical', 'crew', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'few', 'steps', 'backward', 'let', 'dramatic', 'events', 'speak', 'are', 'dramatic', 'enough.Two', 'movies', 'Holocaust', 'background', 'are', 'great', 'examples', 'how', 'could', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'are', 'made-for-tv', 'Escape', 'Sobibor', 'tiny', 'unknown', 'Polish', 'film', 'called', 'Korczak', 'made', 'veteran', 'director', 'Andrej', 'Wajda', 'even', 'so', 'veteran', 'cameraman', 'Robby', 'M', 'ller', 'are', 'stand-out', 'artists', 'presence', 'movie', 'almost', 'unnoticed.The', 'story', 'what', 'here', 'technical', 'matters', 'are', 'there', 'just', 'observe', 'happennings', 'brought', 'script', 'rather', 'emphasize', 'hereby', 'over-do', 'Spielberg', 'thing', 'result', 'great', 'tale', 'told', 'small', 'sober', 'way', 'effect', 'enormous.The', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'just', 'mentionned', 'Escape', 'Sobibor', '.It', 'based-on-facts', 'tale', 'big', 'escape', 'deathcamp', 'Sobibor', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'who', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'face', 'ordinary', 'man', 'cruelty', 'camp', 'slowly', 'realise', 'escape', 'how', 'sheer', 'impossible', 'might', 'seem', 'only', 'chance', 'movie', ""n't"", 'concentrate', 'one', 'leading', 'person', 'more', 'mosaic', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 'do', 'extraordinary', 'things', 'horrible', 'circumstances.No', 'straining', 'effects', 'just', 'arresting', 'tale', 'extremely', 'well', 'told', 'sense', 'reality', 'almost', 'unmatched']",Escape From Sobibor VHS

The story is fact-based, and deals with prisoners in the Sobibor concentration camp where a group of prisoners led by a Russian POW (played brilliantly by Rutger Hauer) decide to plan their escape. Despite the risks, the prisoners feel they should risk it before they are eventually killed by the Nazis.Although the true horrors of the concentration camps are not explicitly depicted in this movie, the courage of the camp inmates, especially those planning the escape is very vividly portrayed. There are lots of tense moments, and there is a fine balance between action and dialogue. The cast is excellent, and if you like watching fact-based movies dealing with the Holocaust, then this should be on your list.",5,Compelling Holocaust drama inspired by true events,1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,830,"['first', 'watched', 'movie', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'sixteen', 'still', 'power', 'inspire', 'thrill', 'story', 'fact-based', 'deals', 'prisoners', 'Sobibor', 'concentration', 'camp', 'where', 'group', 'prisoners', 'led', 'Russian', 'POW', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'decide', 'plan', 'escape', 'risks', 'prisoners', 'feel', 'should', 'risk', 'are', 'eventually', 'killed', 'Nazis.Although', 'true', 'horrors', 'concentration', 'camps', 'are', 'not', 'explicitly', 'depicted', 'movie', 'courage', 'camp', 'especially', 'planning', 'escape', 'very', 'vividly', 'portrayed', 'are', 'lots', 'tense', 'moments', 'fine', 'balance', 'action', 'dialogue', 'cast', 'excellent', 'like', 'watching', 'fact-based', 'movies', 'dealing', 'Holocaust', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'list']",Escape From Sobibor VHS
