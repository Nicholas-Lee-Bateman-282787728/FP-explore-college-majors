He plays a businessman in this title and lets his son down time and time again. His birthday party, school-related affairs and so on.But at His birthday party the son actually wishes for His father to stop lying all the time before blowing out the candles... and it WORKS.Jim Carrey is thrown into a frenzy and instead of gritting His teeth and telling His female co-worker her face or clothing and such look fine, He speaks the truth, spilling the fact that She's a hideous sight to everyone near!I'm telling you parts like that make the movie a hoot.There is another guy in Jim's ex-wife's life now. And Jim despises Him and wants to be in their lives as opposed to this ""Mr. Noboby"".Eventually, things get patched up rather well, and Jim stops lying to the poor boy.Definitely worth watching.

It's got a great cohesive plot about a pathological liar who is suddenly stripped of that ability due to a wish his little kid made.

47333,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0783219458,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","A lot of Jim Carrey films are the same.  Jim Carrey, a stellar physical comedian, flails his body around in ways that make the most straight faced individual crack a smile, and his penchant for smooth talking verbal karate is often put to good use with slick dialog or at least a lot of dialog.`Liar Liar' is little different than the rest, but it is probably one of his more successful ventures.  It strays away from the more outlandish and offensive `gross' humor of the name that made him famous (Ace Ventura) and airs more on the side of his more recent ventures.  `Liar Liar' is a more mature Carrey, before he was actually mature.  It is reminiscent of films like `Yes Man' and `Fun with Dick and Jane'.  It isn't as uproarious with its physical comedy because it is focused more on delivering a worthwhile laugh, and for the most part `Liar Liar' really delivers.In this film, Carrey plays a divorced lawyer who built his life around lying.  When he misses his son's birthday party, he wakes up to a rude awakening.  His son wished that his father wouldn't lie, and so suddenly Carrey's character can't.  This is a great premise for Carrey's predisposition for chatty banter, because it basically allows him to practice word vomit for an hour and a half, which he does extremely well.  The joke does ware thin in a few places, and the schmaltzy ending could have been toned down a tad (but what do you expect).In the end though, this is a great way to laugh the afternoon away.",4,I'd be a liar if I said I didn't laugh...,1339632000,"06 14, 2012",2012,1484,"['lot', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'films', 'are', 'same', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'stellar', 'physical', 'comedian', 'body', 'ways', 'make', 'most', 'straight', 'faced', 'individual', 'crack', 'smile', 'penchant', 'smooth', 'talking', 'verbal', 'karate', 'often', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'slick', 'dialog', 'least', 'lot', 'dialog.', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'little', 'different', 'rest', 'probably', 'one', 'more', 'successful', 'ventures', 'away', 'more', 'outlandish', 'offensive', 'gross', 'humor', 'name', 'made', 'famous', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'more', 'side', 'more', 'recent', 'ventures', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'more', 'mature', 'Carrey', 'was', 'actually', 'mature', 'reminiscent', 'films', 'Yes', 'Man', 'Fun', 'Dick', 'Jane', ""n't"", 'as', 'uproarious', 'physical', 'comedy', 'focused', 'more', 'delivering', 'worthwhile', 'laugh', 'most', 'part', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'really', 'delivers.In', 'film', 'Carrey', 'divorced', 'lawyer', 'who', 'built', 'life', 'lying', 'When', 'son', 'birthday', 'party', 'up', 'rude', 'awakening', 'son', 'wished', 'father', 'would', ""n't"", 'lie', 'so', 'suddenly', 'Carrey', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'great', 'premise', 'Carrey', 'predisposition', 'chatty', 'banter', 'basically', 'practice', 'word', 'vomit', 'hour', 'half', 'extremely', 'well', 'joke', 'ware', 'thin', 'few', 'places', 'schmaltzy', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'tad', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'end', 'great', 'way', 'afternoon', 'away']",N/A

Yes, it's stupid and syrupy at times, and does get hypocritical in regard to being happy without money (as in Jim Carrey makes mucho millions yet plays a character that ends up saying money won't make you happy), but, SO WHAT-IT'S ONLY A MOVIE!  There are so many hysterical scenes here that I don't even know where to begin.  My dad doesn't care for Jim Carrey, but even he had to admit that this movie made him laugh out loud, repeatedly.  There are so many memorable lines and scenes that I feel this is a modern day classic.  His timing with this material is perfect throughout.  If there is a weakness, its the ending.  The courtroom win is great, as well as the scene where he goes to jail for contempt of court (""Yeah, tell that to them when they're adopted-by the Manson Family!!!).  But the movie runs out of gas too soon, as the airport scenes feel out of place, not blending smoothly like everything else.  The final scene is cute (bringing 'The Claw' back is a nice touch) but there's no chemistry between Maura Tierney and Jim Carrey.  I find it impossible to believe they would have been together in the first place, much less have gotten back together in the end.  But it doesn't matter.

Carry plays Fletcher Reede, a successful lawyer who wins pretty much every case he has.  Although his career is doing him good his family life isn't.  He and his wife (Maura Tierney) are divorced, and they have a son, Max (Justin Cooper).  Both parents love Max but Fletcher can't seem to put some time to spend with his kid especially when it comes to making partners with his boss and taking a case where it consists of him lying.  Fletcher breaks his promises to his son and lies to him so his son doesn't hate him.  His wife, Audrey, has had a good relationship with her boyfriend Jerry (Cary Elwes), which has been so well that he proposed to her and wants her and Max to move to Boston with him.  Audrey, at first, decides to not go because of Fletcher and Max's relationship but when Max's heart is broken when Fletcher lied to him about having to much work so he can't attend his B-day party when he is really having sex, Audrey changes her mind.  Max on the other hand makes a wish that his dad can't tell a lie for a whole day, which somehow comes true. As you watch this movie, your laughing will never stop as Fletcher tells the truth to the people around him (who he previously lied to so he doesn't sound like jerk).

From the producer that brought us ""Nutty Professor,"" (Brian Grazer) and the director of hits like, ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" & ""Patch Adams,"" (Tom Shadyac) ""Liar Liar"" is a big hit and probably Jim Carrey's finest and most complete comedic performance. I have said before that Jim Carrey is one of the few actors that can blend the obviously hilarious antics with a dash of his heartwarming, emotional talent. From start to finish, I couldn't stop laughing at this film!! Carrey plays a divorced attorney named Fletcher Reede, who habitually ""stretches the truth."" Spearheaded by an effervescent cast, which includes Jennifer Tilly, as Samantha Cole, a lascivious client of Reede's trying to survive an infidelity case. Also appearing in the film is Swoosie Kurtz, Amanda Donohoe, Maura Tierney as Audrey, Fletcher's ex-wife, Cary Elwes as Jerry, Audrey's boyfriend (""Magoo!""), the late Jason Bernard (Judge Marshall Stevens), and a breakout performance by Justin Cooper, who plays Max, Fletcher's son, that makes a wish for his dad not to lie for at least one day during his birthday party. Every blunder and every scene was gut-busting! This movie is even more funny than ""Bruce Almighty,"" which was yet another hit comedy reuniting the Jim Carrey/Tom Shadyac tandem. A bonus is the extra features within the film, featuring an informative featurette called, ""Bridging the Comedy Chasm,"" a photo gallery, a gag reel, and a deleted scene [which I think should have been added to the film.

After all, what good is a lawyer who can't lie? One thing is certain, Fletcher is about to discover how much the truth can both hurt and heal.First let me say that I'm not generally a Jim Carrey fan.

That exception is the unrelentingly hilarious 'Liar Liar.'All the things that drive me insane about Jim Carrey somehow work wonderfully in this film.

He doesn't care how he wins as long as wins.  The truth is just another hurdle that can be easily be jumped over.  His son, whom he has lied to one too many times, wishes out loud that the lawyer will never be able to lie again.And so, when Carrey's character opens his mouth only the truth will come out.  Although this causes a lot of humorous complications that must be resolved, the lawyer becomes a better person because of it.  One example is how he is forced to honestly represent a sleazy, abusive golddigger in a custody case against a loving father.  It is also interesting to see him try to regain the respect of his ex-wife.  His ex-wife has a new boyfriend who turns out to be a nice guy.But this movie isn't about a jerk who gets his just desserts - even though there is a little of that.  It is about a liar who has to endure the hardship of seeing where his lies get him and the people he loves.  Once he sees the harm he inflicts, he sets about making himself a better person.Even though my review seems serious, LIAR LIAR is great for its laughter value.

47365,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0783219458,Dennis Littrell,"[19, 24]","Jim Carrey puts so much energy and pure comedic brilliance into this movie that we hardly noticed how corny and hackneyed was the plot or how wearily didactic was the moral lesson for all fathers who neglect their children for the goddess of success.  And really we didn't care.  What we loved almost as much as Carrey's rubber mouth and oral blockage (like an overheated boiler fighting not to explode) was the premise: a lawyer that can't lie.  Now there's an oxymoron!  As Carrey tries to explain to his son Max, lawyers need to lie.  Actually he says grownups need to lie, which is a truth that we really do not need to exam too closely here.  To laugh at something deeply troubling in our nature is a way of dealing with it.So the genius of this movie is first the talent of Jim Carrey, but second, for kids who come to the realization of adult mendacity for the first time, it is the discovery of comedy as a way to cope.  Why do adults need to lie? is a question that a kid can never figure out, and then by the time he is an adult himself (or actually a teenager), he can no longer comprehend how important the question once was.  Call it innocence lost, or the socialization process.My favorite part of the movie is the courtroom scene with Jennifer Tilly dressed oh so sluttily and her adulterous beaux looking like a model for the cover of a romance novel and Carrey in tatters in his [expensive] suit.  Second would be the bathroom scene in which Carrey tries to tear himself apart (and seems to almost succeed).  His flapping mouth between the toilet seat and the bowl was inspired.  Give some credit to director Tom Shadyac, who managed to steer the vehicle with Carrey at the controls, and to writers, Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur, who wrote some funny lines.The great comedians totally let themselves go.  They are totally on.  They go to extremes and beyond.  It's like transcending not just the ordinary, but even the imagined.

If you must own one Jim Carrey movie, this is the one. The movie is about a rich divorced lawyer played by Jim Carrey. He has a big problem though. He lies nonstop. He keeps on breaking his promisses and lying to his son. And when he doesn't show to his son's birthday party, the son makes a wish that his dad couldn't lie for just one day. And guess what, it works. So here's this guy that can't say that a red pen is blue. He has to tell the truth to his mother who keeps on calling him, to his secretary, and other people around the office. So, you know, he's going to hurt some people's feelings.

His slick talking, egocentric ways have already cost him his marriage and is hurting his son, Max, as he breaks promise after promise to the boy.  And then Max makes a birthday wish that his dad can't tell a lie for one full day... and it comes true.  Faced with a court case that can only be won by pitching a fantastic story he had concocted, Fletcher is horrified to learn that he can only give brutally honest answers to any question posed.  Not surprisingly, Fletcher's day of honesty does little to endear him with just about anyone but it does force him to confront some brutal truths about himself.The humor in this movie is vintage Jim Carrey, but operates at a more mature level than we saw in his earlier movies such asAce Ventura: Pet DetectiveorDumb and Dumber.  There is still plenty of face twisting and physical comedy, but he also interacts at a very human level with his son and ex-wife making him a far more substantial character.  The supporting cast is strong across the board.  Justin Cooper is unusually good for his tender age as the son.  Jennifer Tilly is perfect as the adulterous shrew that Fletcher must help to win her divorce case if he wants to make partner.  I won't go through the entire cast, but all of them fill their roles as if born to them.Liar Liar is a great comedy, perhaps the last great one Jim Carrey will ever make.  In the ten years that have passed since the film's release, he has made few comedies and almost all of his movies in that time have been lackluster.

In a mess of creative, truly funny moments that tangle just enough with adult themes to make it classic for us, yet fun enough for our teens, Carrey scores one of his best movies, I believe. It has an undying funniness that is carried easily throughout the movie with Carrey's ridiculous, funny antics and even some licks of heart-warming family moments.Although a great movie for adults and teenagers, it's not really meant for kids- not only do they not really get what's going on, but it's got some language that I'd prefer our youngest kids not scrambling around and repeating. And, naturally, when you marry Jim Carrey to a movie about a lawyer who can't lie, there's gonna be some sensuality lurking around somewhere.But otherwise?

The movie is about a guy who lies all the time.  To his wife, to his kid and to everyone else.  He even lies for his job.  He is a lawyer.  On day, his son wishes that he could no longer lie.  If only for one day.  So, it happens!  The man finds out that no matter what or how he tries, he can not lie.  This is especially hard when he is at work on a case trying to help a lady get more from her husband who she is divorcing.  The man knows he has to stretch the truth to win the case, but can not.  The movie is very funny and can be watched over and over again.  I still have the stubs from when my dad, brother and I saw it in the theater.Now I know what your asking yourself.  If he likes the movie so much, why the 3 out of 5?  I will tell you why.  First, this movie definitely looks less than 100% on blu ray.  I actually looks like you are watching it on a VHS tape.  I am sure the DVD version looks the same when played on a blu ray player, so it is what it is.  The other thing is this, there are no special features at all on this copy of the film.  On the DVD you have things likes out takes, deleted scenes, trailer, commentary and more, but on the blu ray there is none of that.  Also, the menu is quite odd.  There is no writing telling you what is what.  Just symbols.  Maybe this is how things in the UK are.  This is the first DVD I have ever gotten that was from the UK, and I am not saying anything bad about it.  Just that it is odd.  So, the movie is great.  It can be watched again and again.  But if you want to own the movie, I would go with the standard DVD.  For the fact of the special features and the fact that the movie does not look any better.

47395,A2MDLOEVS5KUAW,0783219458,Justin Sluss,"[6, 8]","The Movie Itself tells the story of how one smooth talking, habitual liar of an attorney ""Fletcher Reede"" (played by Jim Carey) is forced by his son's birthday wish to have to tell the truth for the next 24 hours. From the second his son ""Max"" (played by Justin Cooper) blows out his birthday candles until that exact time the next day ""Fletcher"" (a shady lawyer) is in for 24 hours of telling ""the whole truth and nothing but the truth.""This movie for it's time was a huge hit and allowed star Jim Carey to portray a character that looked normal (meaning not have to wear a wig, make-up, etc.) but still allowed him to be able to do his crazy spontaneous comedy type of acting at the same time. This film is not only hilarious and one that is sure to make you laugh but it's also kind of touching the story between the father, son. Obviously not as much so as just downright how funny Jim Carey is in this film. Even with all the other ratings considered this is still a film worth checking out if you have never seen it.Video Quality on this release is 1080p VC-1 on a 15 gigabyte HD DVD disc. To be a film from 1997 and only on a HD-15 (15gb HD DVD) the video quality here looks really good I think over the original DVD. I for one owned the original `97 DVD release which was actually a 4:3 Fullscreen version, so for me this is almost like night and day but still it's nothing worthy of a 5 star rating. Honestly at times I have to say this is almost just as good as the video transfer for ""Bruce Almighty"", the other Jim Carey film released the same day on HD DVD. There is some obvious film grain in a few scenes that just hasn't been cleaned up. This translates into some very noticeable film noise in the video presentation from time to time. This is I guess to be expected from a 1997 release like this but I'd have to say the video transfer is an improvement overall and very watchable.Audio Quality on this release is in Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 @ 1.5Mbps which is an improvement over the original DVD releases' Dolby Digital tracks but still nothing that amazing. It gets 3 stars for being an improvement over the original DVD and really that is why it gets this audio quality rating. The film is primarily dialog driven anyway so it really doesn't matter too much about an improvement in audio quality here. This film is mostly about Jim Carey's character and his hilarious dialog he dishes out once his son has makes the birthday wish. You're most likely going to be laughing so hard at some points I doubt you'll hear too much of the movie's sound over yourself.Bonus Materials appear to be nothing more than the latest DVD release's (""Collector's Edition"") bonus materials ported over and presented in 4:3 standard definition. Really disappointing as you'd expect but let's begin with what all you'll find here. First off there's audio Commentary by Director Tom Shadyac. ""Bridging the Comedy Chasm"" (16 minutes) starts off to appear to be nothing more than Jim Carey goofing off but soon we get interviews not only from him but also the producer, Director Tom Shadyac and other cast members like the young Justin Cooper. This proves to really showcase Jim obviously more than anybody but it still is worth watching and has some laughs. ""Deleted Scene"" (4 minutes) is just what you'd expect. Only one deleted scene here obviously but it's a good one if I say so myself. It shows ""Fletcher Reede"" in a court case (which would have been shown probably near or at the beginning of the film if it had not been deleted) defending this big neanderthal of a criminal against this little old man in a neck brace. It's ""Fletcher"" at his finest when he could lie. This scene honestly shouldn't have been deleted if you ask me. It's worth 4 minutes of pure laughter, I think anyway. Last we get a very horrible quality (for both video and sound) version of the original Theatrical Trailer to the film. These bonus materials are nothing short of really disappointing as I started this off saying. The only reason this got as high of a rating as it did for bonus materials is the fact Universal not only includes bookmarks now but the ability to make In and Out's to your favorite scenes. If it were not for that, this would have been rated probably 1 or 1 1/2 stars.-- Review written by Justin Sluss",3,Liar Liar (HD DVD) Review by Justin Sluss,1182297600,"06 20, 2007",2007,4302,"['Movie', 'Itself', 'story', 'how', 'one', 'smooth', 'talking', 'habitual', 'liar', 'attorney', 'Fletcher', 'Reede', 'played', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'forced', 'son', 'birthday', 'wish', 'have', 'tell', 'truth', 'next', '24', 'hours', 'second', 'son', 'Max', 'played', 'Justin', 'Cooper', 'out', 'birthday', 'candles', 'exact', 'time', 'next', 'day', 'Fletcher', 'shady', 'lawyer', '24', 'hours', 'telling', 'whole', 'truth', 'nothing', 'truth', 'movie', 'time', 'was', 'huge', 'hit', 'allowed', 'star', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'portray', 'character', 'looked', 'normal', 'meaning', 'not', 'have', 'wear', 'wig', 'make-up', 'etc', 'still', 'allowed', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'crazy', 'spontaneous', 'comedy', 'type', 'acting', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'hilarious', 'one', 'sure', 'make', 'also', 'kind', 'touching', 'story', 'father', 'son', 'Obviously', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'just', 'downright', 'how', 'funny', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'film', 'Even', 'other', 'ratings', 'considered', 'still', 'film', 'checking', 'out', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'it.Video', 'Quality', 'release', '1080p', 'VC-1', '15', 'gigabyte', 'HD', 'DVD', 'disc', 'be', 'film', '1997', 'only', 'HD-15', '15gb', 'HD', 'DVD', 'video', 'quality', 'here', 'really', 'good', 'think', 'original', 'DVD', 'one', 'owned', 'original', '97', 'DVD', 'release', 'was', 'actually', '4:3', 'Fullscreen', 'version', 'so', 'almost', 'like', 'night', 'day', 'still', 'nothing', 'worthy', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'Honestly', 'times', 'have', 'say', 'almost', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'video', 'transfer', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'other', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'film', 'released', 'same', 'day', 'HD', 'DVD', 'obvious', 'film', 'grain', 'few', 'scenes', 'just', ""n't"", 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'very', 'noticeable', 'film', 'noise', 'video', 'presentation', 'time', 'time', 'guess', 'be', 'expected', '1997', 'release', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'video', 'transfer', 'improvement', 'overall', 'very', 'watchable.Audio', 'Quality', 'release', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', '@', '1.5Mbps', 'improvement', 'original', 'DVD', 'releases', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'tracks', 'still', 'nothing', 'amazing', '3', 'stars', 'being', 'improvement', 'original', 'DVD', 'really', 'why', 'audio', 'quality', 'rating', 'film', 'primarily', 'dialog', 'driven', 'anyway', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'too', 'much', 'improvement', 'audio', 'quality', 'here', 'film', 'mostly', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'character', 'hilarious', 'dialog', 'out', 'once', 'son', 'birthday', 'wish', ""'re"", 'most', 'likely', 'going', 'be', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'points', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'sound', 'yourself.Bonus', 'Materials', 'appear', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'latest', 'DVD', 'release', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'bonus', 'materials', 'ported', 'presented', '4:3', 'standard', 'definition', 'Really', 'disappointing', ""'d"", 'expect', 'let', 'begin', 'what', ""'ll"", 'find', 'here', 'First', 'audio', 'Commentary', 'Director', 'Tom', 'Shadyac', 'Bridging', 'Comedy', 'Chasm', '16', 'minutes', 'appear', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'goofing', 'off', 'soon', 'get', 'interviews', 'not', 'only', 'also', 'producer', 'Director', 'Tom', 'Shadyac', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'young', 'Justin', 'Cooper', 'really', 'showcase', 'Jim', 'obviously', 'more', 'anybody', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'laughs', 'Deleted', 'Scene', '4', 'minutes', 'just', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Only', 'one', 'deleted', 'scene', 'here', 'obviously', 'good', 'one', 'say', 'so', 'Fletcher', 'Reede', 'court', 'case', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'probably', 'beginning', 'film', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'deleted', 'defending', 'big', 'neanderthal', 'criminal', 'little', 'old', 'man', 'neck', 'brace', 'Fletcher', 'finest', 'when', 'could', 'lie', 'scene', 'honestly', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'deleted', 'ask', 'worth', '4', 'minutes', 'pure', 'laughter', 'think', 'anyway', 'Last', 'get', 'very', 'horrible', 'quality', 'video', 'sound', 'version', 'original', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer', 'film', 'materials', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'really', 'disappointing', 'started', 'off', 'saying', 'only', 'reason', 'got', 'as', 'high', 'rating', 'did', 'bonus', 'materials', 'fact', 'Universal', 'not', 'only', 'bookmarks', 'now', 'ability', 'make', 'Out', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'rated', 'probably', '1', '1', '1/2', 'stars.', 'Review', 'written', 'Justin', 'Sluss']",N/A

I actually watched this movie once a day for a long streak of time. I can't remember when I did that last. Oh, yeah, Napoleon Dynamite. Anyhow, it's unique to put the two concepts together. It just makes Carrey's antics even funnier when put against a serious backdrop- that being the serious story of it. Carrey learns that whatever ""losses"" are assumed to be attained through telling the truth, equal advantages are enjoyed. Afterall, more often than not, you have to lie to cover up the lie before it, and that can be a lot of work! Maybe more than telling the truth.

I haven't seen the Ace Ventura movies, or Cable Guy - actually, I don't think I've seen that many of his movies. *Suddenly remembers she has Bruce Almighty* This movie has me in fits everytime I watch it. From the infamous scene with Jim Carrey in the lift with the gorgeous girl with the ample sized chest (Fletcher: Well thats cause you've got big jugs. I... I mean your boobs are huge. I mean, I want to squeeze them. I... ma ma.), to the outtakes at the end of the movie. JEZEBEL!Jim Carrey (which I continously pronounce wrong, and get corrected) is one of those great actors that can most of the time turn his hand at anything, as long as it's funny. I can't honestly see him in a serious movie - and in his latest movie, which I forget the name of, doesn't he look different?! I originally thought it was Christopher Lloyd.I also love Jennifer Tilly, again with a lot of too tight tops! She plays her character very well, and is so funny in the courtroom when he's trying to get her to confess to NOT being a true blonde.There's some terrific lines in this, which only Jim could carry off, and will have you rolling on the floor with laughter. Some of the most memorable ones are:Cop: Do you know why I pulled you over?Fletcher: Depends on how long you were following me.Cop: Let's start from the top.Fletcher: Here it goes: I sped. I followed too closely. I ran a stop sign. I almost hit a Chevy. I sped some more. I failed to yield at a crosswalk. I changed lanes at an intersection. I changed lanes without signaling while running a red light and SPEEDING!Cop: Is that all?Fletcher: No... I have unpaid parking tickets.Fletcher: Your honor, I object!Judge: Why?Fletcher: Because it's devastating to my case!Judge: Overruled.Fletcher: Good call!Office Worker: Hey, Fletcher, how's it hanging?Fletcher: Short, shriveled, and always to the left. (interpret that whichever way you want)Fletcher: Mrs. Cole, the only problem here is that after you've provided years of faithful service and loving support raising his children - They are his?Samantha: Oh yeah. One for sure.Fletcher: After all that, your husband wants to deny you a fair and equitable share of the marital assets based on one single act of indiscretion.Samantha: Seven.Fletcher: Beg your pardon?Samantha: Seven single acts of indiscretion.Fletcher: SEVEN! acts of indiscretion, only one of which he has any evidence and all of which he himself is responsible for.Audrey: Where were you?Fletcher: Having sex.Audrey: Well, I hope it was with someone VERY special.Fletcher: No, see - that's the thing... I don't even like her, but she's a partner and I thought I could help my career by making her squeal.Fletcher: Weight, 105. Yeah, in your bra!Dana: Your Honor, I object!Fletcher: You would!Dana: B*****D!Fletcher: HAG!Judge Stevens: QUIET!If this movie is not in your DVD collection, or you have not seen it, you're missing out on something.

47416,AMG2LF8MLUDN1,0783219458,M. Fields,"[6, 7]","This movie is funny.  Not fall down on the floor funny but funny enough.  For those of you who are tired of Carrey's disgusting toilet humor, here is something very different.  Jim Carrey is loaded with talent and for the life of me I can't understand why he did so many of those other movies.  His  talent really shows in movies like Bruce Almighty, The Truman Show, etc.There is still a bit of innapropriate humor especially for the kids but overall this film is one of Carrey's less smutty films.  The premise is charming.  Carrey plays a smarmy, do what has to do to win a case lawyer who couldn't tell the truth if it was stapled to his head.  He constantly misses play dates with his son (who lives with his mother and she's dating a wimpy, bland, stupid, simple soul of a guy) and disappoints him time after time and never keeps a promise.  His son makes a birthday wish that his father would be unable to tell a lie.The wish comes true and that's where the fun begins.  I'm sure you won't be surprised to find that the story has a predictable heartwarming ending but I won't give it away.  This would be a perfect film for kids if it weren't for those pesky, innapropriate bits.  The film doesn't include nudity but sexual situations are discussed and implied.The boy tries to unwish the wish that he made but since his heart isn't really in it, it doesn't work.  The funniest scenes are probably the courtroom scenes.  Carrey is still a madman with a rubber face.  Don't miss the outakes at the end of the film.  They are hilarious.All things condsidered, you should purchase this one.

Jim Carry plays the part of Fletcher Reede, a young, promising (and very unscrupulous) lawyer who always manages to win his cases. But there is a darker side to  his life. His wife has divorced him because of several affairs, and his son  (who he dearly loves) has been neglected for his professional career.  Clearly, Mr. Reede is a man who never settled down to the more serious  business of life and responsibility.However, Reede's day of come-upance  has arrived. Forgotten about one too many times, his son makes a birthday  wish that his dad would have to tell the truth for 24 hours. An outside  wind blows the cake candles out and the stage is set.Mr. Reede intends  to go about his daily, lie-ridden life (his natural style) but is  flabergasted to suddenly find that whatever he tries to say, the truth  always comes out - and with hilarious results (&quot;I can't believe I said  that&quot;). Jim Carrey has the gift of gab, and God, does it come out in  this film. Either he is very adept at learning complex lines or he is a  natural comedian to whom words flow like water.There are sight-gags in  the film, but these are really secondary to the dialog -- which is  priceless.Unlike &quot;The Mask&quot;, this film has a more serious side  in the pathos of a neglected family and a wrecked personal life.

Granted, it made more mistakes with the legal stuff than Law and Order could ever figure out how to pull off, but the plot was good and I found the concept of a lawyer needing to be 100% honest pretty amusing.  I did find the fact that this scenario resulted from his son's birthday wish a weak explanation at best...maybe they could have had a scene where a witchdoctor or something sold the kid's mom the candles to make more sense of it or something else like that.  This was just weak.  Also, I didn't like the mother.  Like many of the female leads in Jim Carrey's movies, Maura Tierney was just bland and only seemed to be in the film at all because a woman was needed.  Her boyfriend, played by Cary Elwes, was also pretty bland and his attempts to show emotion fell flat...maybe these two were made for each other.  What I loved about this film was the comedy.  90% of the jokes cracked me up!  I'm attributing that to the fact they didn't come from the same, weird brand of humor we've seen in films like Ace Ventura or Dumb and Dumber.  These jokes actually fit into the plot and didn't seem to just be there so the film could call itself a comedy.

In fact, Liar Liar is still one of his best comedies.Carrey plays Fletcher Reid, a conniving lawyer who wins every case simply because he masters the art of lying. His profession, however, gets in the way of his already crumbled family life: his divorced wife and 5 year old son Max. After promising Max that he will be at his birthday and breaking it, as usual, Max makes a wish that his dad doesn't lie for a whole day, and that's where the fun begins.Carrey uses his rubbery-face antics, body movements and screams to comic perfection.
