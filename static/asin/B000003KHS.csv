Then when I saw the movie the next year I was happier still.  The acting was superb(especially Marlon Brando) , the screenplay was a virtual copy of the book, and the editing was fantastic.  It easily deserved every Oscar that it got in 1974.  I have since seen the movie several times since 1973 and would see it again tomorrow.

I don't feel I have to tell you what made this film so compelling. But, seeing as how I'm milking my ""redneck in China"" and ""grits with chopsticks"" bit for all it's worth right now, I'll mention juxtapositions. Like watching PURPLE RAIN and THE GODFATHER as a double feature. Who else does that? Both films are stylized, and understandably dated in a few spots. And I thought PURPLE RAIN was too violent? I stand corrected.Juxtapositions of the American Dream, la cosa nostra, and Catholic old Italy. When Michael Corleone went into exile in Sicily, and learned all the men had been killed in vendettas, the first memorial he saw was to Alfredo LaRocca. When he courted Apollonia, I almost spit out my dentures. Prince courted Apollonia. Anyone who would marry Vito Corleone's daughter is insane. We should only watch the Corleones from a safe distance. Godfather-in-law? Yikes.I have THE GODFATHER 2 and THE GODFATHER 3, but I won't get to them right away. I've heard 2 is better than 1, but I hope you understand why I'm skeptical. If you've seen 1, that is. They killed off Brando. Jeez.

490512,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000003KHS,Acute Observer,"[3, 5]","This film starts on a wedding day, and introduces the characters. One scene shows an offended father asking for justice (or revenge) on the two men who beat up his daughter. Another example of the influence of the rich and famous over civil courts? But the girl's father seeks an older system of justice, and succeeds. This would be known as the unwritten law. Later we see how negotiations can influence movie production. Its who you know, not what you know (as on Wall Street). Changing conditions presents Don Corleone with a chance to enter a more lucrative business. But he refuses, since this business could damage his relationship with important politicians. [Could this be true given the events over the past fifty years?] This results in an attempt to give Don Corleone an early retirement. (We later find out who was the traitor.)The incident at the hospital, when Michael finds it deserted, shows powerful forces at work. Michael acts quickly to safeguard his father. (And we find another crook.) Michael devises a strategy to eliminate business problems; it works. Michael's coolness contrasts to Sonny's emotions. Then Michael takes a long vacation afterwards. Sonny is lured into a trap, and killed in a spectacular manner. But this results in an end to the warfare. Don Corleone agrees to let the others draw water from the well (use his political influence to allow drug dealing). [And what does that tell you about out Establishment? But this is only a work of fiction, not journalism.]After the death of Don Corleone, Michael plans a take-over move to reduce or eliminate his business competitors. This will take place after his nephew is baptized. [Dramatic effect? Waiting could let opportunities slip away.] Old scores are settled with the liquidation of Michael's rivals. But some cleaning up has to be done close to home. The film ends with the Corleone family moving west to the unspoiled lands of Las Vegas (the California trade). Will that bring them more happiness?Most films are condensed versions of the book. You may want to read the 1968 novel for background, and to better judge the filmed version. Events are simplified and telescoped to fit within the constraints of time and budget. There is no mention of the political and economic conflicts of those days. It is not a coincidence for organized crime to flourish in the financial capitals like New York, Chicago, Boston, etc. Its as if Big Corporations need people to do the things that lawyers can't legally accomplish.",4,The Legend of the Godfather,1102377600,"12 7, 2004",2004,2506,"['film', 'wedding', 'day', 'characters', 'One', 'scene', 'offended', 'father', 'asking', 'justice', 'revenge', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'beat', 'up', 'daughter', 'example', 'influence', 'rich', 'famous', 'civil', 'courts', 'girl', 'father', 'older', 'system', 'justice', 'would', 'be', 'known', 'unwritten', 'law', 'Later', 'see', 'how', 'negotiations', 'can', 'influence', 'movie', 'production', 'who', 'know', 'not', 'what', 'know', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Changing', 'conditions', 'presents', 'Don', 'Corleone', 'chance', 'enter', 'more', 'lucrative', 'business', 'business', 'could', 'damage', 'relationship', 'important', 'politicians', '[', 'Could', 'be', 'true', 'given', 'events', 'past', 'fifty', 'years', ']', 'results', 'attempt', 'give', 'Don', 'Corleone', 'early', 'retirement', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'was', 'traitor', 'incident', 'hospital', 'when', 'Michael', 'deserted', 'powerful', 'forces', 'work', 'Michael', 'quickly', 'safeguard', 'father', 'find', 'crook', 'Michael', 'strategy', 'eliminate', 'business', 'problems', 'Michael', 'coolness', 'Sonny', 'emotions', 'Then', 'Michael', 'long', 'vacation', 'afterwards', 'Sonny', 'lured', 'trap', 'killed', 'spectacular', 'manner', 'results', 'end', 'warfare', 'Don', 'Corleone', 'let', 'others', 'draw', 'water', 'well', 'use', 'political', 'influence', 'allow', 'drug', 'dealing', '[', 'what', 'tell', 'out', 'Establishment', 'only', 'work', 'fiction', 'not', 'journalism', ']', 'death', 'Don', 'Corleone', 'Michael', 'take-over', 'move', 'reduce', 'eliminate', 'business', 'competitors', 'will', 'take', 'place', 'nephew', 'baptized', '[', 'Dramatic', 'effect', 'Waiting', 'could', 'let', 'opportunities', 'slip', 'away', ']', 'Old', 'scores', 'are', 'settled', 'liquidation', 'Michael', 'rivals', 'cleaning', 'up', 'be', 'done', 'close', 'home', 'film', 'Corleone', 'family', 'moving', 'west', 'unspoiled', 'lands', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'California', 'trade', 'Will', 'bring', 'more', 'happiness', 'Most', 'films', 'are', 'condensed', 'versions', 'book', 'may', 'want', 'read', '1968', 'novel', 'background', 'better', 'judge', 'filmed', 'version', 'Events', 'are', 'simplified', 'telescoped', 'fit', 'constraints', 'time', 'budget', 'mention', 'political', 'economic', 'conflicts', 'days', 'not', 'coincidence', 'organized', 'crime', 'flourish', 'financial', 'capitals', 'New', 'York', 'Chicago', 'Boston', 'etc', 'Big', 'Corporations', 'need', 'people', 'do', 'things', 'lawyers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'legally', 'accomplish']",The Godfather VHS
490513,A2BJ3MTMMW4L37,B000003KHS,adil ali,"[3, 5]","After reading several reviews of this film and its sequel, I have come to the conclusion that film is misunderstood.  The Godfather isn't just another crime film or another mafia film, it is a story of power, family, and capitalism.  The crime is merely an illustration of the power.The Godfather deals with power on many levels.  In the first Godfather, we see the influence of power- for example the Horse head scene or the assasination of Moe Greene- and more importantly how through miscalculations and poor tactical decisions, this power is nearly lost.  For example, Sonny's decision to have Michael murder Solozzo and McCluskey proves to be a grave error, as a full-scaled war ensues between the Corleone family and the other five families which results in a considerable weakening of the family's strength.  I can't speak on the aquisition of power yet, because that requires a proper reading of the book or alternatively, a viewing of the second film.Why, you may ask, is power such a central theme in the movie?  The Godfather hints that organized crime is yet another form of American business-thatis, capitalism.  After all, why is Vito Corleone gunned down in the street near the beginning?  Not simply because he refused Solozzo, but because he refused to exert his political influence to help Solozzo's business. The Godfather part 2 deals with this on a more profound level,  giving the viewer an exact idea of political corruption(remember Senator Geary?).But the Godfather is also representative of another phenomenon which came to fruition in America in the 70's:  A loss of innocence and corruption.  Michael Corleone's character is a full embodiment of these feelings, and wee see in the second film how business robs him of his youth, his trust, and makes him a cynical and lonely man.Films like Goodfellas and Casino can't hold a candle to this film.  In those films, the main characters are portrayed as lunatics and have none of the charm of subtlety of a character like Don Corleone.  Before I leave, I might suggest reading the book and paying close attention to the Godfather part 2 to grasp these ideas properly.",5,Not just another mafia film...,1104278400,"12 29, 2004",2004,2141,"['reading', 'several', 'reviews', 'film', 'sequel', 'have', 'come', 'conclusion', 'film', 'misunderstood', 'Godfather', ""n't"", 'just', 'crime', 'film', 'mafia', 'film', 'story', 'power', 'family', 'capitalism', 'crime', 'merely', 'illustration', 'power.The', 'Godfather', 'deals', 'power', 'many', 'levels', 'first', 'Godfather', 'see', 'influence', 'power-', 'example', 'Horse', 'head', 'scene', 'assasination', 'Moe', 'Greene-', 'more', 'importantly', 'how', 'miscalculations', 'poor', 'tactical', 'decisions', 'power', 'nearly', 'lost', 'example', 'Sonny', 'decision', 'have', 'Michael', 'murder', 'Solozzo', 'McCluskey', 'be', 'grave', 'error', 'full-scaled', 'war', 'ensues', 'Corleone', 'family', 'other', 'five', 'families', 'results', 'considerable', 'weakening', 'family', 'strength', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'aquisition', 'power', 'yet', 'proper', 'reading', 'book', 'alternatively', 'viewing', 'second', 'film.Why', 'may', 'ask', 'power', 'such', 'central', 'theme', 'movie', 'Godfather', 'hints', 'organized', 'crime', 'yet', 'form', 'American', 'business-thatis', 'capitalism', 'why', 'Vito', 'Corleone', 'gunned', 'down', 'street', 'beginning', 'Not', 'simply', 'refused', 'Solozzo', 'refused', 'exert', 'political', 'influence', 'help', 'Solozzo', 'business', 'Godfather', 'part', '2', 'deals', 'more', 'profound', 'level', 'giving', 'viewer', 'exact', 'idea', 'political', 'corruption', 'remember', 'Senator', 'Geary', '.But', 'Godfather', 'also', 'representative', 'phenomenon', 'came', 'fruition', 'America', '70', 'loss', 'innocence', 'corruption', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'character', 'full', 'embodiment', 'feelings', 'wee', 'see', 'second', 'film', 'how', 'business', 'robs', 'youth', 'trust', 'cynical', 'lonely', 'man.Films', 'Goodfellas', 'Casino', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'film', 'films', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'lunatics', 'have', 'none', 'charm', 'subtlety', 'character', 'Don', 'Corleone', 'leave', 'might', 'suggest', 'reading', 'book', 'paying', 'close', 'attention', 'Godfather', 'part', '2', 'grasp', 'ideas', 'properly']",The Godfather VHS

490524,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000003KHS,Andrew Ellington,"[8, 10]","Quite frankly, `The Godfather' truly is technically perfect.  In fact, it is so perfect that writing this review has been an Achilles-Heel for me.  I have wanted to write this review for a while now but have been deathly afraid of failing to do it justice.  It's a rarity to have a film this universally lauded; this universally respected and honestly there really is no other film that comes close to being as well loved and adored as `The Godfather'.  So with that, where do you go?  What do you say?  How can you begin to review a film of this magnitude?I'll start by saying that everything (good) that has been said about this film is true.I'll work from there.It has been said that `The Godfather' is that rare film that just feels right from beginning to end.  Every facet seems to fit just perfect, seems to flow evenly and brilliantly.  Every actor is perfect (and I do truly mean perfect) for their roles.  They melt into character and never break, always elevating the scenes they embody.  The script is tightly woven, intricate and engrossing.  The direction by Francis Ford Coppola may very well be the single greatest directive execution in the history of film making.  His delivery of this marvelous film is really what helps create its sheer presence and undeniable commanding power.  Coppola cemented himself here as one of the great directors of all time.The film tells the story of the Corleone family.  The family is run by the `Don' Vito Corleone.  He's an aging man, yet very respected and admired.  Known as `Godfather', Vito has much power within the organized crime families and thus is looked to often for aid and support.  When he is looked to for that support in the aid of heroin distribution on the part of the Tattaglia family, Vito finds that his higher standard of morality clashes with the direction the `underworld' is taking.  His refusal to lend aid to the Tattaglia family places the Corleone family in danger.This forms the catalyst for the films major plot and thus unfolds in a marvelous manor, allowing the audience to become completely and utterly absorbed in the events taking place on the screen.  As Vito's life is placed in danger and his youngest son Michael crosses over into the life he swore he'd never embrace, `The Godfather' quickly becomes the most interesting and highly entertaining film one could possible imagine.The performances by the entire cast are flawless, utterly flawless.  Marlon Brando effortlessly embodies Vito with such memorable charisma and temperance.  His performance is truly one of the greatest of all time.  Al Pacino delivers his finest performance ever as Michael Corleone.  This performance is of course one that he hones and perfects (his delivery in `The Godfather Part II' is truly the finest of his career) and becomes one with.  Pacino is one of those actors that I feel has suffered in recent years from lack of good source material.  Anyone new to the works of Pacino may write him off as a no talent veteran actor who stars in one worthless film after another; and judging by his recent films they would be justified in their feelings; but when you take a look at where this actor came from you will see that when he was in his prime he was truly brilliant.  James Caan is also amazing here as the hotheaded Santino (or `Sonny' as he is referred).  His performace is electric to say the least.  Robert Duval is also on the top of his game and delivers yet another flawless performance (now here is an actor who has never lost his touch) and John Cazale delivers nicely as Fredo, the `Dons' other son.  His performance in `The Godfather Part II' is much more effective and defined, but he sets a nice foundation for himself here.  Another performance that is fleshed out nicely in the sequel is that of Kay Adams, who is played by Diane Keaton.  Her performance here is subtle and short, but her character is one of the most memorable in the films that follow.`The Godfather' truly stands the test of time as one of the most recognizable and highly lauded films ever released.  Many critics consider this the finest movie ever filmed, and technically I feel they are correct.  There isn't a single flaw to be seen here for everything and everyone is a perfect compliment to one another.I don't know what more I can say without either spoiling too much of the films plot (there is a lot to be seen here, yet it never feels rushed or over-stuffed which is yet another marvelous accomplishment) or rambling on to the point of exhaustion so I'll stop here; ending by quite simply saying that `The Godfather' will leave the viewing with absolutely no regrets.  It is quite simply perfect in every way shape and form and is the pure definition of `cinema'.  This is what the movies are all about; great storytelling; and no greater story has ever been told.",5,`The Greatest Film of All Time'; I think it earned that title...,1208131200,"04 14, 2008",2008,4839,"['Quite', 'frankly', 'Godfather', 'truly', 'technically', 'perfect', 'fact', 'so', 'perfect', 'writing', 'review', 'been', 'Achilles-Heel', 'have', 'wanted', 'write', 'review', 'while', 'now', 'have', 'been', 'deathly', 'afraid', 'failing', 'do', 'justice', 'rarity', 'have', 'film', 'universally', 'lauded', 'universally', 'respected', 'honestly', 'really', 'other', 'film', 'close', 'being', 'as', 'well', 'loved', 'adored', 'Godfather', 'where', 'do', 'go', 'What', 'do', 'say', 'How', 'can', 'begin', 'review', 'film', 'magnitude', ""'ll"", 'start', 'saying', 'everything', 'good', 'been', 'said', 'film', 'true.I', ""'ll"", 'work', 'there.It', 'been', 'said', 'Godfather', 'rare', 'film', 'just', 'feels', 'right', 'beginning', 'end', 'facet', 'fit', 'just', 'perfect', 'flow', 'evenly', 'brilliantly', 'actor', 'perfect', 'do', 'truly', 'mean', 'perfect', 'roles', 'melt', 'character', 'never', 'break', 'always', 'elevating', 'scenes', 'embody', 'script', 'tightly', 'woven', 'intricate', 'engrossing', 'direction', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'single', 'greatest', 'directive', 'execution', 'history', 'film', 'making', 'delivery', 'marvelous', 'film', 'really', 'what', 'create', 'sheer', 'presence', 'undeniable', 'commanding', 'power', 'Coppola', 'cemented', 'here', 'one', 'great', 'directors', 'time.The', 'film', 'story', 'Corleone', 'family', 'family', 'run', 'Don', 'Vito', 'Corleone', 'aging', 'man', 'yet', 'very', 'respected', 'admired', 'Known', 'Godfather', 'Vito', 'much', 'power', 'organized', 'crime', 'families', 'thus', 'looked', 'often', 'aid', 'support', 'When', 'looked', 'support', 'aid', 'heroin', 'distribution', 'part', 'Tattaglia', 'family', 'Vito', 'higher', 'standard', 'morality', 'clashes', 'direction', 'underworld', 'taking', 'refusal', 'lend', 'aid', 'Tattaglia', 'family', 'Corleone', 'family', 'danger.This', 'catalyst', 'films', 'major', 'plot', 'thus', 'unfolds', 'marvelous', 'manor', 'allowing', 'audience', 'become', 'completely', 'utterly', 'absorbed', 'events', 'taking', 'place', 'screen', 'Vito', 'life', 'placed', 'danger', 'youngest', 'son', 'Michael', 'life', 'swore', ""'d"", 'never', 'embrace', 'Godfather', 'quickly', 'most', 'interesting', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'one', 'could', 'possible', 'imagine.The', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'are', 'flawless', 'utterly', 'flawless', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'effortlessly', 'Vito', 'such', 'memorable', 'charisma', 'temperance', 'performance', 'truly', 'one', 'greatest', 'time', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'finest', 'performance', 'ever', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'performance', 'course', 'one', 'perfects', 'delivery', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'II', 'truly', 'finest', 'career', 'one', 'Pacino', 'one', 'actors', 'feel', 'suffered', 'recent', 'years', 'lack', 'good', 'source', 'material', 'Anyone', 'new', 'works', 'Pacino', 'may', 'write', 'off', 'talent', 'veteran', 'actor', 'who', 'one', 'worthless', 'film', 'judging', 'recent', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'justified', 'feelings', 'when', 'take', 'look', 'where', 'actor', 'came', 'will', 'see', 'when', 'was', 'prime', 'was', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'James', 'Caan', 'also', 'amazing', 'here', 'hotheaded', 'Santino', 'Sonny', 'referred', 'performace', 'electric', 'say', 'least', 'Robert', 'Duval', 'also', 'top', 'game', 'delivers', 'yet', 'flawless', 'performance', 'now', 'here', 'actor', 'who', 'never', 'lost', 'touch', 'John', 'Cazale', 'delivers', 'nicely', 'Fredo', 'Dons', 'other', 'son', 'performance', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'II', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'defined', 'nice', 'foundation', 'here', 'performance', 'fleshed', 'out', 'nicely', 'sequel', 'Kay', 'Adams', 'who', 'played', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'performance', 'here', 'subtle', 'short', 'character', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'films', 'follow.', 'Godfather', 'truly', 'test', 'time', 'one', 'most', 'recognizable', 'highly', 'lauded', 'films', 'ever', 'released', 'Many', 'critics', 'consider', 'finest', 'movie', 'ever', 'filmed', 'technically', 'feel', 'are', 'correct', ""n't"", 'single', 'flaw', 'be', 'seen', 'here', 'everything', 'everyone', 'perfect', 'compliment', 'one', 'another.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'spoiling', 'too', 'much', 'films', 'plot', 'lot', 'be', 'seen', 'here', 'never', 'rushed', 'over-stuffed', 'yet', 'marvelous', 'accomplishment', 'rambling', 'point', 'exhaustion', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'here', 'ending', 'quite', 'simply', 'saying', 'Godfather', 'will', 'leave', 'viewing', 'absolutely', 'regrets', 'quite', 'simply', 'perfect', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'pure', 'definition', 'cinema', 'what', 'movies', 'are', 'great', 'storytelling', 'greater', 'story', 'ever', 'been', 'told']",The Godfather VHS

Additionally, though the screenplay has been written by Mario Puzo and Francis Coppolla even then the movie does not really fit the bill.

Marlon Brando gets shot midway during the film and enters the hospital after which voiceovers [VO] take on which are just a narration of gang wars [which cannot be seen]. The useless sex scene against the door is irrelevant. Maybe if the screenwriters had given a full view of the scene against the door with a gorgeous girl then maybe it would have might have made some type of a rotten porn.

I thought it would've been hard to review ""Dark Side Of The Moon"", but I now realize how hard it is to put into words ""The Godfather's"" effect on pop culture. From the sweeping epic storyline to the brilliant performances (including an Oscar-winning performance by Marlon Brando) to everything in between, everything is so hard to explain.What I can tell you however is that one of the few films in the world worthy of the title ""must own"". Nobody can have a truly enviable dvd collection without this 1972 cinematic masterpiece directed by Francis Ford Coppolla and featuring a stunning array of some of the film world's greatest talents, including Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a host of others. Unlike most film addaptations, the film stays true to Mario Puzo's ingenius original novel. There are very little differences (I'm sure there are some) between the book and the novel (at least from a general outlook).And back to the acting. It is evident from his first line that Brando never had a finer role than beleagured mob boss Don Vito Corleone. Brando packs an emotional wallop into his performance. From this performance it's easy to see why all of Hollywood still worships at his feet. Al Pacino as his son Michael Corleone proves that he truly was worthy to be Brando's successor, and for the most part retains that status even today (""Gigli"" not withstanding). James Caan is brilliant as Sonny, who meets a gruesome end (one of cinema's best deaths) at a toll both. Future Woody Allen cohort Diane Keaton shimes as Kaye Adams, Michael's much put upon girlfriend who loves him yet cannot put up with his violent lifestyle. Robert Duvall plays the adpated Corleone brother, Thomas Hagen, and plays the role to a tee. Talia Shire, though forever remembered as Adrienne from the ""Rocky"" series, is perfect for Connie, the lone Corleone sister. And the actor who plays Fredo (unfortunately, I forgot his name, John something, I think) is really good and unfortunately passed away at a young age.This is truly an example of a cinematic masterpiece.

490531,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B000003KHS,Austin Somlo,"[0, 1]","Viewed: 7/04, 7/05, 12/07, 12/12Rate: 107/05: The Godfather is a great film, and it deserves every attention. Somehow, I don't consider this as a perfect film, to be helmed in the ranks of Casablanca, Lawrence of Arabia, and On the Waterfront. I have heard many times that this was perhaps Brando's finest role, but, as I know he was great in this film, he blows the doors off in two films from the 1950's, so Vito Corleone is his modest acting. The famous line ""An offer that he can't refuse"" uttered by Brando isn't exactly that special for me. Anyway, one thing that makes The Godfather so special is the remarkable transformation that Al Pacino underwent with his character of Michael Corleone over three parts. Certainly, Al Pacino scored big time. The rest of the cast is great, and the film is beautifully woven. The story is unbelievably intricate-like. The fans of The Godfather should be thankful for Bonnie and Clyde for freeing the artistic restraints on violence because without them, The Godfather wouldn't be the film it is today. I wouldn't do The Godfather injustice for labeling it as a gangster or a mob film. I feel it was a different type of a film, more like an organized American business that happened to have criminal activities. There are some brilliant scenes in this film, done well by Gordon Willis. Yet it is possible that The Godfather is vastly overrated.12/07: Seeing The Godfather once more again, I am starting to feel the ""overrated"" part that have laid dormant for years. It is like a virus that was waiting for an opportune time before making its appearance known. First of all, The Godfather is too long. A certain hour of the picture could have been cut out. There are several scenes that seemed to be out of context. Take the scene where Clemenza speaks of how to make pasta, is that part necessary? Another is when Michael Corleone in Italy. I can't see how all of it are related to the picture as a whole. Five minutes of it would have been sufficient. At the beginning, I see that there are rough transitions, possibly bad editing work, especially with Michael Corleone and Kay Adams. Those scenes feel rehearsed once too many times. Also, I am puzzled as to why would Michael Corleone spill the dark secrets to some bimbo. Speaking of bad editing work, there is a woman's face appearing like as if she is an apparition during the funeral of Vito Corleone. Or is that the editor's face? Anyway, Marlon Brando overacts during the first act of the film, but he settles down later on. I've seen his work in A Streetcar Named Desire and On the Waterfront many times, and what Brando did in The Godfather doesn't compare with the two films. The most irritating character of The Godfather is easily James Caan's. The whole time, I feel very troubled in accepting the fact that this guy could be the next Don? Why, he can hardly hold temper down if some pencil freak pulled his pants down. There are some characters badly developed; take Kay Adams, I am not sure who she is. Nor do I know the history of her relationship with Michael Corleone. Then, take Clemenza, although I saw The Godfather II, he doesn't seem to display the indurated affinity with Vito Corleone based on the years of their friendship. That has to be the most striking part of the film. I remember the part where all heads of four families were murdered. The oddest part of this is: who were they? Barzini, yeah...but really what do I know about him? Tattagalia, same thing. It's a mystery to me who the other two were. Funny after they were killed, how quiet is the aftermath. While the focus is on several men, I don't get to see enough of the family members in the background, most notably Vito Corleone's wife. While The Godfather does have a plot, I fail to have care for it. Worse, I fail to care about the characters. We are talking about gangsters here. How is that possible that The Godfather is the most renowned picture of all time yet, at the same time, the audience celebrates the evil men? Very strange, indeed.. All in all, The Godfather is one of the most overrated pictures in the history along with The Graduate, The Searchers and The Godfather Part II. What I saw is actors giving impressionable lines, but the depth of characters is sorely lacking.12/12: Overrated? Hmm, somewhat. I still can't get over the fake fight scene between Sonny and Carlo.

We also meet the advisor Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), Sonny Coreone (James Caan) and Michael Corleone (Al Pacino.)Michael utters the line, &quot;I'm not like my father.&quot;  Then the rest of the movie shows Michael's slow transformation into a man exactly like his father.  The movie shows the reasons why Michael would change, but don't actually show him changing.  Michael just gradually takes control of the business.  The scenes in Italy with his wife were especially touching.  Her death probably shaped him more than anything, and made him realize he would never be safe unless he went on the offensive.My problem with the movie is how it sped through time, covering years at a time.

490543,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B000003KHS,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[1, 1]","Winner of three Academy Awards including Best Picture, The Godfather was nominated for an additional eight. The brainchild of celebrated author Mario Puzo, the film is considered the crowning achievement of Francis Ford Coppola's directing career. Providing audiences with a glimpse into the notorious underworld of warring New York crime families, The Godfather catapulted a number of actors into fame's limelight, among them - James Caan, Al Pacino, and Robert Duvall (all three nominated for Best Supporting Actor). In addition, Marlon Brando turns in, arguably, the most memorable performance of his career. Certainly among the top five films of all time, the case could be made that The Godfather is the most perfect movie ever produced...The film opens as ""Don"" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) hosts his daughter's wedding, entertaining friends and business associates. Vito's favorite son Michael (Al Pacino) has come home from the war, and he's determined to do something different with his life other than joining the family business. Idealistic at heart, the young Michael inspires his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) with tales of the fine and outstanding things he will do with his life. Through the eyes of Michael, the audience learns of the family's various business methods and the hierarchy of its system. Vito's eldest son Sonny (James Caan) is the heir apparent to his father's empire. Middle son Fredo (John Cazale) performs his part in the business, but few consider him a possible successor. Providing legal council to the family is Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), a long-time friend of the family who Michael treats as a brother.Things are well for the Corleone family until Vito is approached by opportunistic newcomer Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) wishing to sell drugs on the street. He asks for the Don's blessing so he can expand his operations. But Vito sees a big difference between gambling and prostitution and drug running on school playgrounds and family neighborhoods. The Don's preference for placing family above all else conflicts with the changing times.When competing crime families are more accommodating to Sollozzo's business proposal, the enterprise sparks a bloody war between the crime families which quickly leads to the murder of Sonny Corleone. Vito attempts to end the conflict in its early stages, but an attempt is made on his life as well.Avenging his brother's death, Michael carries out a hit on two men in an Italian restaurant. Afterward, he hides out for several months in Sicily where he marries a beautiful village girl. But she dies from a car bomb shortly thereafter - a car bomb intended for Michael.With the battle for crime syndicate supremacy in full swing, Michael is forced to fill the vacuum created by his brother Sonny's death. As his father reaches the end of his life, Michael is groomed as his replacement. When Vito finally dies of a heart attack, Michael lets his presence be known in direct fashion. All enemies of the Corleone family are eliminated in a single bloody hour.

This is not your typical gangster movie and it won several Oscars in 1972, including ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Actor"" (Brando). The movie gets everything right with a phenomenal cast, perfect settings, and excellent cinematography.No plot spoilers from me: The story follows the powerful Corleone ""mafia"" family as they attempt to hold on to their influence in post-WWII NY. The character development is allowed to take place at an unhurried pace as this is a movie that jumps months between scenes, giving us a chance to see how they change over time. This also has some really talented actors, including Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Al Pacino, and, one of my favorites, Abe Vigoda (still alive at the time of this review), that were perfectly cast for their rolls. It was directed by Francis Ford Coppola and it is my favorite movie by him as well. The action is well spaced throughout the movie and it is not needlessly graphic, but certainly feels realistic. The settings and attention to detail makes it easy to forget that wasn't actually made in the 1940s, really helping the viewer to become immersed in the atmosphere. The cinematography was also outstanding, using great perspective shots and often implying more than what was shown.This is definitely a classic that is as good as it is said to be.Highly Recommended!CFH",5,Oustanding - Highly Recommended,1343174400,"07 25, 2012",2012,1440,"['Godfather', 'one', 'must', 'see', 'movies', 'are', 'sharing', 'teens', 'not', 'typical', 'gangster', 'movie', 'won', 'several', 'Oscars', '1972', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Brando', 'movie', 'everything', 'right', 'phenomenal', 'cast', 'perfect', 'settings', 'excellent', 'cinematography.No', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'story', 'powerful', 'Corleone', 'mafia', 'family', 'attempt', 'hold', 'influence', 'post-WWII', 'NY', 'character', 'development', 'allowed', 'take', 'place', 'unhurried', 'pace', 'movie', 'months', 'scenes', 'giving', 'chance', 'see', 'how', 'change', 'time', 'also', 'really', 'talented', 'actors', 'including', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'James', 'Caan', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'one', 'favorites', 'Abe', 'Vigoda', 'still', 'alive', 'time', 'review', 'were', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'rolls', 'was', 'directed', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'favorite', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'action', 'well', 'spaced', 'movie', 'not', 'needlessly', 'graphic', 'certainly', 'realistic', 'settings', 'attention', 'detail', 'easy', 'forget', 'was', ""n't"", 'actually', 'made', '1940s', 'really', 'helping', 'viewer', 'become', 'immersed', 'atmosphere', 'cinematography', 'was', 'also', 'outstanding', 'using', 'great', 'perspective', 'shots', 'often', 'implying', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'shown.This', 'definitely', 'classic', 'as', 'good', 'said', 'be.Highly', 'Recommended', 'CFH']",The Godfather VHS

490554,AP0DQSDFSLP4P,B000003KHS,"Christopher M. MacNeil ""Chris M""","[1, 2]","Not even Marlon Brando's controversial refusal of his Best Actor Oscar diminished his powerful performance in this equally powerful 1972 blockbuster film that, in the 30-plus years since, has come to achieve contemporary classic status. Even by current standards, ""The Godfather"" still qualifies as a blockbuster: budgeted at $6 million, it raked in $245 million worldwide and $135 million in domestic receipts. Categorized as either a ""crime"" or ""gangster"" film, ""The Godfather"" is less that and more the story of changing times from ""old world"" values that Brando, as head of a Mafia ""family,"" resists. In doing so, Brando's ""Don"" Vito Corleone ignites an underworld war when he turns back on joining competing ""families"" in their infiltration of the country's illegal drug industry. The Godfather himself is a victim of the Mafia bloodbath when hitmen from the competing family gun him down. As the Don lays vulnerable and still targeted for death, youngest son Michael (Al Pacino, in his first substantial role) is forced to compromise his earlier pledge not to work in the ""family business"" as he takes on the role as his father's protector. Just as the film is about the changing of the times, it is also about Michael's emergence from rebel son (at first) to reluctant family ""enforcer"" and, eventually, to Don and protector of the family mantel. Pacino, who was nearly fired from the film, renders a dark metamorphisis from clean and wholesome World War II hero to Mafia don who, by film's end, has a near insatiable taste for blood. Along with Pacino, Brando has stellar backup in a strong supporting cast that includes James Caan as eldest son Santino, the late John Cazale as middle brother Fredo and Robert Duvall as ""adopted"" son and family lawyer Tom Hagen. And while the Corleone's keep it all in the family, so does director Francis Ford Coppola. He cast sister Talia Shire as the Godfather's only daughter and his father to score the film. As the Don's ""little girl,"" Connie, Ms. Shire's character development in this film is (if there can be any criticism) unsatisfying in much the same way as it is for Diane Keaton's character as Michael's long-suffering fiancee and, later, as Mafia wife. Only in the franchise's subsequent sequels did Shire's and Keaton's characters evolve, Shire's to rebel sister in the second film to ""godmother"" status in the third, and Keaton to emerging unsatisfied Mafia wife in the second film to independent ex-wife in ""Godfather Part III."" Along with Brando's Best Actor statute, the film won Oscars as Best Picture, best director for Coppola and best screenplay for both him and Mario Puzzo (on whose novel the screenplay was written). The film was given an R-rating for its violence (no fewer than 11 killings) and a brief bare-breast shot (of Michael's doomed first wife). Even more than three decades after its release, ""The Godfather"" remains as perfect as it was hailed in its day, and it still makes us think of ""family"" in a non-traditional way.",4,All in the Family,1151798400,"07 2, 2006",2006,3002,"['Not', 'even', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'controversial', 'refusal', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'diminished', 'powerful', 'performance', 'equally', 'powerful', '1972', 'blockbuster', 'film', '30-plus', 'years', 'come', 'achieve', 'contemporary', 'classic', 'status', 'Even', 'current', 'standards', 'Godfather', 'still', 'blockbuster', 'budgeted', '6', 'million', 'raked', '245', 'million', 'worldwide', '135', 'million', 'domestic', 'receipts', 'Categorized', 'crime', 'gangster', 'film', 'Godfather', 'less', 'more', 'story', 'changing', 'times', 'old', 'world', 'values', 'Brando', 'head', 'Mafia', 'family', 'doing', 'so', 'Brando', 'Don', 'Vito', 'Corleone', 'underworld', 'war', 'when', 'back', 'joining', 'competing', 'families', 'infiltration', 'country', 'illegal', 'drug', 'industry', 'Godfather', 'victim', 'Mafia', 'bloodbath', 'when', 'hitmen', 'competing', 'family', 'gun', 'down', 'Don', 'vulnerable', 'still', 'targeted', 'death', 'youngest', 'son', 'Michael', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'first', 'substantial', 'role', 'forced', 'compromise', 'earlier', 'pledge', 'not', 'work', 'family', 'business', 'role', 'father', 'protector', 'Just', 'film', 'changing', 'times', 'also', 'Michael', 'emergence', 'rebel', 'son', 'first', 'reluctant', 'family', 'enforcer', 'eventually', 'Don', 'protector', 'family', 'mantel', 'Pacino', 'who', 'was', 'nearly', 'fired', 'film', 'dark', 'metamorphisis', 'clean', 'wholesome', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'hero', 'Mafia', 'don', 'who', 'film', 'end', 'near', 'insatiable', 'taste', 'blood', 'Pacino', 'Brando', 'stellar', 'backup', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'James', 'Caan', 'eldest', 'son', 'Santino', 'late', 'John', 'Cazale', 'middle', 'brother', 'Fredo', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'adopted', 'son', 'family', 'lawyer', 'Tom', 'Hagen', 'Corleone', 'keep', 'family', 'so', 'director', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'cast', 'sister', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'Godfather', 'only', 'daughter', 'father', 'score', 'film', 'Don', 'little', 'girl', 'Connie', 'Ms.', 'Shire', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'criticism', 'unsatisfying', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'character', 'Michael', 'long-suffering', 'fiancee', 'later', 'Mafia', 'wife', 'Only', 'franchise', 'subsequent', 'sequels', 'did', 'Shire', 'Keaton', 'characters', 'evolve', 'Shire', 'rebel', 'sister', 'second', 'film', 'godmother', 'status', 'third', 'Keaton', 'emerging', 'unsatisfied', 'Mafia', 'wife', 'second', 'film', 'independent', 'ex-wife', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'III', 'Brando', 'Best', 'Actor', 'statute', 'film', 'won', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Picture', 'best', 'director', 'Coppola', 'best', 'screenplay', 'Mario', 'Puzzo', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'film', 'was', 'given', 'R-rating', 'violence', 'fewer', '11', 'killings', 'brief', 'bare-breast', 'shot', 'Michael', 'doomed', 'first', 'wife', 'Even', 'more', 'three', 'decades', 'release', 'Godfather', 'as', 'perfect', 'was', 'hailed', 'day', 'still', 'think', 'family', 'non-traditional', 'way']",The Godfather VHS

I guess that may be that up until this point I didn't know why so many people LOVE this film, and now that I have experianced it I can agree with the masses that you rarely watch a film as COMPLETE as 'The Godfather'.  By that statement I mean that, from start to finish, every line spoken, every scene shot, every moment caught on film feels just right.  Nothing feels contrived or forced, nothing feels out of place or 'added' but everything feels natural and, well, perfect.  Now I really don't know what to say...I mean, how do you review a masterpiece.  It almost feels wrong to say anything but ""see this movie if you haven't already"" for fear that something you say will take away from the film, but I will try my best.  First of all the story is classic, and no, I have not read Puzi's novel, but I have decided to order it and will read it shortly, but the story regardless if you've read the novel is still gripping.  Marlon Brando, in his most critically aclaimed role, plays 'Don' Vito Corleone, the head of his mafia family.  The story follows as the Don is asked by the Tattaglia family for his aid in trafficing narcotics throughout New York.  Now Vito is a man of the old country, and he believes narcotics to be a dirty business and so he refuses, politely, to aid the family.  This causes problems, and after the Don is attacked and hospitalized his family struggles to exact their revenge while taking care of the responcibilities their father can no longer tend to.  Vito's son's all take seperate approaches to the crime.  Sonny (James Caan) is hotheaded and placed in charge in his father absence.  He wants to strike while the iron is hot sort-a-speak.  Tom Hagen, the Corleone adopted son (Robert Duvall) is the sensable consultant to the family (and family lawyer) and he advises Sonny to take his time and think things through.  If he strikes fast and hard he may bring upon them the vengence of the other mafia family's.  Michael (Al Pucino) is the youngest son, and up until this time he had nothing to do with the family business, and he had no desire to get involved.  He has just returned from war and is courting Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), but when his fathers life is placed on the line he has a change on heart and exacts his revenge on the Tattaglia's resulting in a feud or war between the family's and causes Michael to flee to Sicily for his safty.

The acting is superb, from the major stars down to the bit parts, the dialogue is fantastically adapted from the book, and the cinematography is stunning.

490562,A2GYX971VETQBV,B000003KHS,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[2, 3]","It is difficult to pen a review for a film as magnificent as THE GODFATHER.  A reviewer captured the feeling well in saying that one gets the sense that everyone in this film was born to make it.  It is as if Destiny herself brought together this gripping story, capable director, and legendary actors to inspire one of the greatest cinematic works of all time.  Very few films allow for multiple viewings among non-fanatics.  But though I have seen THE GODFATHER over half-a-dozen times, I never fail to thoroughly enjoy the experience.  It never fails to pull me into the dark and intriguing web it weaves.  And, though it is three hours in length, I never pause it to attend to the rest of life.  This film demands your attention and holds you captive from start to finish.Let us begin with the plot.  THE GODFATHER breaks free from all stereo-types.  It is not a traditional ""mob"" movie in the sense that it does not rely on violence to energize an otherwise predictable and pedestrian plot.  This film, while quite violent at times, does not dwell on violence.  Instead, we see the true life of the mafia: a world run largely by businessmen in closed meetings.  Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is an aging Don of the Corleone family.  He has spent his entire life building up the family from the humblest of beginnings.  Now, in his old age, the Don is failing to keep up with the tides of change and his life is threatened for it.  As the Don's control begins to fade, someone from the family must step forward and ""take over the family business.""  Two mean step forward: the eldest son, Sonny Corleone (James Caan) and the family consigliere, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall).  But for all his enthusiasm, Sonny is hot-headed and ill-fit to lead.  He lacks the patience, understanding, and ""reasonableness"" of his father.  And Tom, while close to the family, is not blood and is, perhaps, too much like the old Don to move the family forward in the twentieth-century.As it turns out, the only member of the family capable of leadership is the youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  Ironically, Michael is the favored son--someone the old Don had plans for and the son who could finally break free of the family business and lead a normal life.  Michael is reluctant to have anything to do with his family's business affairs.  At the outset of the film, he does not associate himself with the family, he is in love with a woman he hopes to spend his life with, and proclaims himself to be ""nothing like his father.""  Of course, the tragedy of the series lies, in part, in watching how good men, like Vito and Michael Corleone, become evil men through a series of little compromises.The acting in this film, as all reviewers agree, is superb.  Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is often said to be the greatest of his career.  Brando manages to breathe life and complexity into the old Don.  Whereas many ""mafia"" films rely on stereotypes and cardboard characters, Vito is someone we would love to have as our grandfather.  He is kind, sensible, patient, and wise.  It just so happens that he is also, at times, ruthless in his business affairs.  Hats off to Brando for being able to convey that complexity.  I could go on about the excellence of the supporting cast, but Al Pacino really deserves our attention here.  Pacino's performance of Michael Corleone is widely regarded as one of the greatest film performances of all time.  What strikes me about this film every time I watch it is the degree of character movement and development that takes place during its run time.  At the beginning, we see a Michael who is somewhat shy and reluctant.  We see that same Michael become saddened and outraged when his father's life is threatened, and we see him coolly and confidently transition into his role as Don, effortlessly and ruthlessly establishing his position in one swift blow.  Pacino manages to make his movement legitimate and believable.  We feel that time is passing and the years are changing Michael--all within the confines of a three-hour film.  That's incredible and Pacino deserves more credit for it than he was given at the time of the movie's release.Finally, in addition to the great screenplay and terrific acting, Francis Ford Coppola shines in this film.  The film has beautiful direction, beautiful cinematography, wonderful pacing, great lighting...the list goes on.  THE GODFATHER gets everything right.You cannot go wrong with THE GODFATHER, particularly at the ridiculously low price you can obtain it for.  The new edition is beautifully done and will be an instant favorite in your film collection.",5,"A Masterpiece: The Perfect Combination of Story, Vision, and Acting Talent",1172102400,"02 22, 2007",2007,4637,"['difficult', 'pen', 'review', 'film', 'as', 'magnificent', 'GODFATHER', 'reviewer', 'captured', 'feeling', 'well', 'saying', 'one', 'sense', 'everyone', 'film', 'was', 'born', 'make', 'Destiny', 'brought', 'together', 'gripping', 'story', 'capable', 'director', 'legendary', 'actors', 'inspire', 'one', 'greatest', 'cinematic', 'works', 'time', 'Very', 'few', 'films', 'allow', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'non-fanatics', 'have', 'seen', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'half-a-dozen', 'times', 'never', 'fail', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'experience', 'never', 'pull', 'dark', 'intriguing', 'web', 'three', 'hours', 'length', 'never', 'pause', 'attend', 'rest', 'life', 'film', 'attention', 'captive', 'start', 'finish.Let', 'begin', 'plot', 'GODFATHER', 'breaks', 'free', 'stereo-types', 'not', 'traditional', 'mob', 'movie', 'sense', 'not', 'rely', 'violence', 'energize', 'otherwise', 'predictable', 'pedestrian', 'plot', 'film', 'quite', 'violent', 'times', 'not', 'dwell', 'violence', 'Instead', 'see', 'true', 'life', 'mafia', 'world', 'run', 'largely', 'businessmen', 'closed', 'meetings', 'Vito', 'Corleone', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'aging', 'Don', 'Corleone', 'family', 'spent', 'entire', 'life', 'building', 'up', 'family', 'humblest', 'beginnings', 'Now', 'old', 'age', 'Don', 'failing', 'keep', 'up', 'tides', 'change', 'life', 'threatened', 'Don', 'control', 'fade', 'someone', 'family', 'must', 'step', 'forward', 'take', 'family', 'business', 'Two', 'mean', 'step', 'forward', 'eldest', 'son', 'Sonny', 'Corleone', 'James', 'Caan', 'family', 'consigliere', 'Tom', 'Hagen', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'enthusiasm', 'Sonny', 'hot-headed', 'ill-fit', 'lead', 'patience', 'understanding', 'reasonableness', 'father', 'Tom', 'close', 'family', 'not', 'blood', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'old', 'Don', 'move', 'family', 'forward', 'twentieth-century.As', 'out', 'only', 'member', 'family', 'capable', 'leadership', 'youngest', 'son', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Ironically', 'Michael', 'favored', 'son', 'someone', 'old', 'Don', 'had', 'plans', 'son', 'who', 'could', 'finally', 'break', 'free', 'family', 'business', 'lead', 'normal', 'life', 'Michael', 'reluctant', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'family', 'business', 'affairs', 'outset', 'film', 'not', 'associate', 'family', 'love', 'woman', 'spend', 'life', 'be', 'nothing', 'father', 'course', 'tragedy', 'series', 'part', 'watching', 'how', 'good', 'men', 'Vito', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'become', 'evil', 'men', 'series', 'little', 'compromises.The', 'acting', 'film', 'reviewers', 'agree', 'superb', 'Brando', 'performance', 'Vito', 'Corleone', 'often', 'said', 'be', 'greatest', 'career', 'Brando', 'breathe', 'life', 'complexity', 'old', 'Don', 'Whereas', 'many', 'mafia', 'films', 'rely', 'stereotypes', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'Vito', 'someone', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'grandfather', 'kind', 'sensible', 'patient', 'wise', 'just', 'so', 'also', 'times', 'ruthless', 'business', 'affairs', 'Hats', 'Brando', 'being', 'able', 'convey', 'complexity', 'could', 'go', 'excellence', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'really', 'attention', 'here', 'Pacino', 'performance', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'widely', 'regarded', 'one', 'greatest', 'film', 'performances', 'time', 'What', 'film', 'time', 'watch', 'degree', 'character', 'movement', 'development', 'place', 'run', 'time', 'beginning', 'see', 'Michael', 'who', 'somewhat', 'shy', 'reluctant', 'see', 'same', 'Michael', 'become', 'saddened', 'outraged', 'when', 'father', 'life', 'threatened', 'see', 'coolly', 'confidently', 'transition', 'role', 'Don', 'effortlessly', 'ruthlessly', 'establishing', 'position', 'one', 'swift', 'blow', 'Pacino', 'make', 'movement', 'legitimate', 'believable', 'feel', 'time', 'passing', 'years', 'are', 'changing', 'Michael', 'confines', 'three-hour', 'film', 'incredible', 'Pacino', 'more', 'credit', 'was', 'given', 'time', 'movie', 'release.Finally', 'addition', 'great', 'screenplay', 'terrific', 'acting', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'shines', 'film', 'film', 'beautiful', 'direction', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'wonderful', 'pacing', 'great', 'lighting', 'list', 'GODFATHER', 'everything', 'right.You', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'particularly', 'ridiculously', 'low', 'price', 'can', 'obtain', 'new', 'edition', 'beautifully', 'done', 'will', 'be', 'instant', 'favorite', 'film', 'collection']",The Godfather VHS

This film proved to be only the beginning in this triumphant history making.  It received ten Oscar nominations, winning only three (Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Actor [Marlon Brando refused]).  It's proceeded with two sequels that either match or beat the quality of the original.  While most film sequels don't match even closely to its original, this trilogy has stood against the test of time.  This film has since influenced many filmmakers that have since come.""The Godfather"" follows the lives of the Corleone family, one who commits organized crime.  Vito Corleone, the family leader, is slowly losing his health due to old age.  His struggle to create peace within the rival families is growing harder because of major recent conflicts.  People are continually get murdered.  The Corleone family must protect and love one another more urgently to assure the safety.  Meanwhile, this follows the rising power of Michael Corleone, who becomes better known through the remaining trilogy.  The eyeopening series of events ready audiences for the triumphant sequel.Director and writer Francis Ford Coppola leads the cast and crew to create this amazing masterpiece.  He pays great homage to the novel of the same name written by Mario Puzo, who assisted in writing this screenplay.  The maintained emotional stance allows room to explore themes beyond organized crime.  Themes of family, love, protection, and italian pride fit wonderfully within the film.  Amazingly, this film doesn't portray the Corleone family as either good or evil.  Despite the crimes committed by them, the powerful stance never loses its edge.  Throughout, the film's passion that keeps audiences watching remains intact.The physical backgrounds give accurate and great additions to this film.  Through the buildings to the wardrobes, it feels like actual 1940's living.  The research proves revalent with its obvious hard work.  Its level of greatness presents itself as more than elaborate backgrounds.  Audiences can sense the individual themes through these physical beings, namely italian pride and organized crime.  The use of color and their tones matches well with the film.Everytime the music is heard, one thought arises to the listeners: ""The Godfather"".  The type of music is always played in the perfect scenes to match with the events.  Two versions of the main theme are presented: the orchestral and the italian-based.  It begins with a long trumpet solo, no instruments backing it.  Then it changes to the chorus played by the woodwinds.  Afterwards, it plays various melodies with various instruments.  Then the chorus repeats itself but more intensely and with string instruments.  The other songs also present themselves wonderfully, though not as well-known.""The Godfather"" stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and John Cazale.  This amazing cast makes this film them much more powerful.  Audiences could not possible ask for better.  Pacino, Caan, and Duvall also received Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actor.  This is one of few times in Oscar history that three actors from the same film are nominated for the same catagory.  None are more deserving than these three with their fine performances.  Brando states his performance the heaviest by developing an old-man italian accent for his role as Vito Corleone.  His expressions match well with Vito's personality and his health/ emotions.Such tremendous film quality makes ""The Godfather"" deserving of its title as a classic.  This is sure to please many audiences for many more years.  Those who like this film should also watch the two sequels.  Those interested in them must watch this edition first.

In this case the families happen to be both Italian-American and Mafia, but that's just incidental.  I've never read the novel that this is based on but it's my understanding that Mario Puzo's book is pulpier than than the film that Francis Ford Coppola made of it.  That is one of the reasons that this film is elevated above all others in that it could have been soapier and glitzier than it was but it did not succumb to that and credit has to be given to Coppola as both screenwriter and director for that.  Coppola emphasized in his script it's most important theme, family, and concentrated on developing characters instead of stereotypes.  Yes, some people remember the more violent and sensational aspects of this film.  We also know the people in this film.  The Corleone's are as familiar to us as either are own family or neighbors.  Marlon Brando gives an appropriately subdued performance here as Don Vito Corleone.  His character seems melancholic and rueful, seeming to be mourning his situation in life or the changing ways of his chosen way of life, yet accepts the reality and the responsibilities that come for a man in his position.  Al Pacino in his second film, his first being the little seen ""Panic in Needle Park"", is dynamic as Michael, the son that the Don wanted better things for but because of changing circumstance is drawn into the family business.  Michael is to prove that he is more than up to the challenge of settling scores.  James Caan as Sonny, the heir apparent to the Don who may be a little to emotional and hot-headed for the job, does tremendous work here.  Robert Duvall is also good in the role of Tom Hagen, adopted son of the Corleones, who acts as lawyer for the family's business.  It also should be noted that John Cazale appears here as Fredo, the ineffectual Corleone son.  Fredo's character isn't really developed until the second installment of this saga but I would like to note that Cazale, who died young in 1978 but made the most of his short life.  Besides appearing in the first two ""Godfather"" films he also appeared and was quite effective in ""The Conversation"", ""Dog Day Afternoon"", and ""The Deer Hunter"", released after his death.  There are may other great actors (Talia Shire, Richard Castellano, etc.) so numerous who do good work here.  Some would feel that ""The Godfather"" is a romanticized depiction of the Mafia but I don't see that as the case.  ""The Godfather"" is a good story whose milieu is incidentally in the world of organized crime.  On a final note, Coppola contributes an excellent and very informative commentary to the film on the DVD that enhances the viewing of the film particularly for those who've seen it numerous times.",5,This is the One,1096675200,"10 2, 2004",2004,2939,"['greatest', 'American', 'film', 'time', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'slickest', 'piece', 'film-making', 'broke', 'new', 'ground', 'themes', 'importance', 'family', 'biological', 'professional', 'resonate', 'day', 'case', 'families', 'happen', 'be', 'Italian-American', 'Mafia', 'just', 'incidental', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'novel', 'based', 'understanding', 'Mario', 'Puzo', 'book', 'pulpier', 'film', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'made', 'one', 'reasons', 'film', 'elevated', 'others', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'soapier', 'glitzier', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'succumb', 'credit', 'be', 'given', 'Coppola', 'screenwriter', 'director', 'Coppola', 'emphasized', 'script', 'most', 'important', 'theme', 'family', 'concentrated', 'developing', 'characters', 'instead', 'stereotypes', 'Yes', 'people', 'remember', 'more', 'violent', 'sensational', 'aspects', 'film', 'also', 'know', 'people', 'film', 'Corleone', 'are', 'familiar', 'are', 'own', 'family', 'neighbors', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'appropriately', 'subdued', 'performance', 'here', 'Don', 'Vito', 'Corleone', 'character', 'melancholic', 'rueful', 'seeming', 'be', 'mourning', 'situation', 'life', 'changing', 'ways', 'chosen', 'way', 'life', 'yet', 'reality', 'responsibilities', 'come', 'man', 'position', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'second', 'film', 'first', 'being', 'little', 'seen', 'Panic', 'Needle', 'Park', 'dynamic', 'Michael', 'son', 'Don', 'wanted', 'better', 'things', 'changing', 'circumstance', 'drawn', 'family', 'business', 'Michael', 'prove', 'more', 'up', 'challenge', 'settling', 'scores', 'James', 'Caan', 'Sonny', 'heir', 'apparent', 'Don', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'emotional', 'hot-headed', 'job', 'tremendous', 'work', 'here', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'also', 'good', 'role', 'Tom', 'Hagen', 'adopted', 'son', 'Corleones', 'who', 'lawyer', 'family', 'business', 'also', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'John', 'Cazale', 'here', 'Fredo', 'ineffectual', 'Corleone', 'son', 'Fredo', 'character', ""n't"", 'really', 'developed', 'second', 'installment', 'saga', 'would', 'like', 'note', 'Cazale', 'who', 'died', 'young', '1978', 'made', 'most', 'short', 'life', 'appearing', 'first', 'two', 'Godfather', 'films', 'also', 'appeared', 'was', 'quite', 'effective', 'Conversation', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'released', 'death', 'are', 'may', 'other', 'great', 'actors', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'Richard', 'Castellano', 'etc', 'so', 'numerous', 'who', 'do', 'good', 'work', 'here', 'would', 'feel', 'Godfather', 'romanticized', 'depiction', 'Mafia', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'case', 'Godfather', 'good', 'story', 'milieu', 'incidentally', 'world', 'organized', 'crime', 'final', 'note', 'Coppola', 'excellent', 'very', 'informative', 'commentary', 'film', 'DVD', 'viewing', 'film', 'particularly', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'numerous', 'times']",The Godfather VHS

Every element of this film is perfect.  I've seen it and its sequels more than a dozen times and am always caught up in this fascinating epic.  Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo never allow us outside the circle of the Corleones, so it is their values that define good and evil in this film, not the mores of society at large.  Simply put, loyalty to the family is seemingly all that matters.  Then why, when Michael finally decides to involve himself inextricably in the affairs of the family out of concern for his father, does he become such a cold and feared figure instead of revered, beloved, and respected like his father?

490568,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,B000003KHS,David E. Levine,"[0, 0]","Marlon Brando plays Vito Carleone, the ""Godfather."" He is the head of one of five major crime families in the post WWII period. If you show him the proper respect, he does favors for you, like severely roughing up two young men who violated a local unbdertaker's daughter or, put the head of a movie mogul's horse in bed with him when he fails to give a Carleone protege a major part in a movie. However, Don Carleone operates with a standard of morality. When other crime families and younger members of his own family want to branch out into narcotics, he's against it. Purportedly, his reason is that it isn't good business, that the cops can't be bought the way they can for other operations, such as gambling. However, you can sense that Carleone has a modicum of decency and that he knows that this is not what you do to innocent members of society ... get them hooked on drugs.Vito Carleone is a businessman and, in his business, as a matter of business, sometimes people have to be killed. However, it's always business and if there is a lesser alternative, such as the horse's head, then you do that rather than kill someone. He has sons played by Al Pacino, James Caan, and John Cazale, and a consigliere played by Robert Duval. He also has a daughter, played by Talia Shire, who is victimized by an abusive husband (the movie opens during her wedding). Of the sons, Michael Carleone (Pacino's role) is back from serving in the war; he is well educated and planning on a life outside of the crime family. He is courting a young non Italian woman played by an almost unrecognizably young Diane Keaton. His finding a life outside of organized crime is fine with his father. Events, however, draw him back in.The generation gap is striking. Whereas Vito carleone used violence frequently, it was often tempered by something less than homicide. The educated, cultired Michael, however, takes things personally. If he or his crime family is crossed, the offender is killed. Vito Carleone, in a meeting of crime family leaders sought to end violence and not seek revenge for the killing of one of his son's and for his own serious wounding. Michael, on the other hand, regularly uses killings as both a business tool and as a way to settle personal scores. Both Vito Carleaone's sons and leaders of other crime families (most who seem to be younger than Vito Carleaone) want to expand into narcotics over Vito's objections. As he passes from the scene and a new generation takes over, things do not change for the better. All sense of decency seems to go out with the demise of Vito Carleone. Indeed, toward the end of the movie, we see just how chillingly violent Michael can be as multiple orders, he has given, are carried out while he stands in church as the godfather of his sister's newborn baby.This movie has drawn viewers for many reasons, not the least of which is the violence depicted in many scenes. To me, however, the fascination is with the poignant, generational tale.",5,A Tale of Generations,1113436800,"04 14, 2005",2005,2989,"['Marlon', 'Brando', 'Vito', 'Carleone', 'Godfather', 'head', 'one', 'five', 'major', 'crime', 'families', 'post', 'WWII', 'period', 'show', 'proper', 'respect', 'favors', 'severely', 'roughing', 'up', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'violated', 'local', 'unbdertaker', 'daughter', 'put', 'head', 'movie', 'mogul', 'horse', 'bed', 'when', 'give', 'Carleone', 'protege', 'major', 'part', 'movie', 'However', 'Don', 'Carleone', 'standard', 'morality', 'When', 'other', 'crime', 'families', 'younger', 'members', 'own', 'family', 'want', 'branch', 'out', 'narcotics', 'Purportedly', 'reason', ""n't"", 'good', 'business', 'cops', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bought', 'way', 'can', 'other', 'operations', 'such', 'gambling', 'However', 'can', 'sense', 'Carleone', 'modicum', 'decency', 'not', 'what', 'do', 'innocent', 'members', 'society', 'get', 'hooked', 'drugs.Vito', 'Carleone', 'businessman', 'business', 'matter', 'business', 'sometimes', 'people', 'have', 'be', 'killed', 'However', 'always', 'business', 'lesser', 'alternative', 'such', 'horse', 'head', 'then', 'do', 'rather', 'kill', 'someone', 'sons', 'played', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'James', 'Caan', 'John', 'Cazale', 'consigliere', 'played', 'Robert', 'Duval', 'also', 'daughter', 'played', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'who', 'victimized', 'abusive', 'husband', 'movie', 'wedding', 'sons', 'Michael', 'Carleone', 'Pacino', 'role', 'back', 'serving', 'war', 'well', 'educated', 'planning', 'life', 'crime', 'family', 'courting', 'young', 'non', 'Italian', 'woman', 'played', 'almost', 'unrecognizably', 'young', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'finding', 'life', 'organized', 'crime', 'fine', 'father', 'Events', 'however', 'back', 'in.The', 'generation', 'gap', 'striking', 'Whereas', 'Vito', 'carleone', 'used', 'violence', 'frequently', 'was', 'often', 'tempered', 'something', 'less', 'homicide', 'educated', 'cultired', 'Michael', 'however', 'things', 'personally', 'crime', 'family', 'crossed', 'offender', 'killed', 'Vito', 'Carleone', 'meeting', 'crime', 'family', 'leaders', 'sought', 'end', 'violence', 'not', 'seek', 'revenge', 'killing', 'one', 'son', 'own', 'serious', 'wounding', 'Michael', 'other', 'hand', 'regularly', 'uses', 'killings', 'business', 'tool', 'way', 'settle', 'personal', 'scores', 'Vito', 'Carleaone', 'sons', 'leaders', 'other', 'crime', 'families', 'most', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'younger', 'Vito', 'Carleaone', 'want', 'expand', 'narcotics', 'Vito', 'objections', 'scene', 'new', 'generation', 'over', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'change', 'better', 'sense', 'decency', 'go', 'out', 'demise', 'Vito', 'Carleone', 'Indeed', 'end', 'movie', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'chillingly', 'violent', 'Michael', 'can', 'be', 'multiple', 'orders', 'given', 'are', 'carried', 'church', 'godfather', 'sister', 'newborn', 'baby.This', 'movie', 'drawn', 'viewers', 'many', 'reasons', 'not', 'least', 'violence', 'depicted', 'many', 'scenes', 'however', 'fascination', 'poignant', 'generational', 'tale']",The Godfather VHS

The first is the long sequence that opens the film: the wedding day of the Don's daughter Connie. A parade of well-wishers and favor-seekers visits the Godfather, each seeking his favor and counsel. Thus it is established that this is an important man, a man of respect. When he finally steals away enough time to dance with his daughter, we cannot believe that this man is a criminal.The sequence that closes the film is equally powerful: the christening of Connie's child (with Michael as his godfather), intercut with the murders of Michael's rivals for domination of the Mafia. Thus we learn that the son, too, is a man of respect, a man who will stop at nothing to continue his father's legacy.These opening and closing scenes show us the transition of power and honor, from father to son. We see the importance of religion and tradition in the lives of these young Americans, as well as the depths of their hypocrisy. Michael is a new kind of leader, though. One with a vision beyond the violence, a vision of a better future. Like the Kennedys (who similarly rose from crime to respectability), the Corleones eventually rise above their sordid past. Despite their flaws, or perhaps because of them, they are a quintessentially American family.Reviewed by David Montgomery, Mystery Ink",5,The Greatest American Epic,965001600,"07 31, 2000",2000,1389,"['are', 'many', 'classic', 'scenes', 'quot', 'Godfather', 'quot', 'two', 'stand', 'out', 'mind', 'first', 'long', 'sequence', 'film', 'wedding', 'day', 'Don', 'daughter', 'Connie', 'A', 'parade', 'well-wishers', 'favor-seekers', 'Godfather', 'seeking', 'favor', 'counsel', 'Thus', 'established', 'important', 'man', 'man', 'respect', 'When', 'finally', 'away', 'enough', 'time', 'dance', 'daughter', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'man', 'criminal.The', 'sequence', 'film', 'equally', 'powerful', 'christening', 'Connie', 'child', 'Michael', 'godfather', 'intercut', 'murders', 'Michael', 'rivals', 'domination', 'Mafia', 'Thus', 'learn', 'son', 'too', 'man', 'respect', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'continue', 'father', 'legacy.These', 'opening', 'closing', 'scenes', 'show', 'transition', 'power', 'honor', 'father', 'son', 'see', 'importance', 'religion', 'tradition', 'lives', 'young', 'Americans', 'as', 'well', 'depths', 'hypocrisy', 'Michael', 'new', 'kind', 'leader', 'though', 'One', 'vision', 'violence', 'vision', 'better', 'future', 'Kennedys', 'who', 'similarly', 'rose', 'crime', 'respectability', 'Corleones', 'eventually', 'rise', 'sordid', 'past', 'flaws', 'perhaps', 'are', 'quintessentially', 'American', 'family.Reviewed', 'David', 'Montgomery', 'Mystery', 'Ink']",The Godfather VHS

Realizing that the entire second section of the novel could not be fit into the movie (but was cleverly woven into &quot;The Godfather, part 2&quot;) Puzo and Coppola produced a film which was remarkably consistent with the remainder of the book (although there are a few 'jumps' in the plot which make more sense to someone also familiar with the book). The cast for this picture could not possibly be better -- both in the first-rate Hollywood actors AND in the on-location Sicilian actors selected for those portions of the movie filmed on that island. Brando is perfect as the aging Don, Pacino portrays the inherently moral but tormented Michael extremely well, Caan is ideal as the hotheaded Sonny, and Robert Duvall, in the best role of his career, is splendid as Tom Hagen. (And I loved Simonetta Stefanelli as Apollonia)! In addition to the writing and the casting, the filming and cinematography was also excellent. Who could ever forget Sonny's murder at the toll booth?

490573,A3MAZM138KFVOW,B000003KHS,D. Blackdeer,"[2, 3]","1972 Best Picture about a Sicilian organized-crime family undergoing transition during post World War II.  Vito Corleone, portrayed by Marlon Brando, once the most powerful Don in the Mafia, is nearing retirement and plans to pass the reins.  The rising narcotics racket challenges Vito's druthers however, to maintain his interests' status quo in imports and politics-and threatens the family's existence when an assassination attempt puts Vito in hospital intensive care.The Corleone family dealing with the crisis is where the story shines, while their business provides an intriguing edge, the human drama among the siblings is the main feature.  Most important is the heir and the events that unfold to reveal a less than clear case of who will be Vito's successor.  The eldest Sonny, played by James Caan, has an explosive temper that compromises his better judgment; Fredo, played by James Cazale, lacks the necessary leadership qualities; and the youngest son Michael, played by Al Pacino, has distanced himself from the family with intentions for a legitimate career.  The most interesting is Michael; having returned from duty with the Marines, he displays dynamic qualities after Vito's hit and commits to a dramatic turn-around in his ambitions out of loyalty to the family.  Mike goes on to perform a service that will change his life and the family's future forever.This is an excellent movie; the story, actors and production are a pleasure to watch.  Actor Robert Duvall turns in an excellent supporting role as Tom Higgins, the adopted son who serves as Vito's legal counselor; and Al Lettieri is menacing as Virgil Sollozzo, the trafficker who tries to assassinate Vito to open the way for his narcotics business.  Director Francis Ford Coppola set the standard for this genre in 1972 and is probably the inspiration for follow-on features such as ""GoodFellas"" and ""The Sopranos.""

490576,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B000003KHS,Dennis Littrell,"[33, 41]","This is one of the greatest films ever made. Any doubt about that can be dispelled by watching the movie. I missed this when it first came out, and then a curious thing happened. For some reason I thought I had seen the film. One decade and then two went by and I kept hearing what a great film The Godfather was. But I was unimpressed because I thought I had seen it.I don't know what film I had seen, but it wasn't The Godfather. Seeing this film for the first time over thirty years after the fact of its production is a startling experience. The Godfather is a work of art from first scene to last. There is the most amazing adherence to that fiction which is truer than fact.I would like to say that I played cards with Mario Puzo who wrote the novel from which the film was adapted and who famously worked with Coppola on the screenplay, but in fact I only played cards with some people who had played cards with Puzo. Ah, such is the effect of celebrity. Puzo became like Coppola something of a legend after this film was produced, and everybody suddenly knew him or played cards with him. Everybody, from the most unsophisticated celluloid fan to the most erudite and jaded critic had walked out of that theater after 171 minutes mesmerized and delighted and emotionally moved by an uncompromising look at not just a Mafia family, but the psychology of families since time immemorial. The truth that we have all lived and experienced was made large on the screen in the form of the Corleones. I can guarantee you that audiences from every culture on the planet would understand the underlying psychology of this movie and take it to some serious extent as their own.Marlon Brando plays the godfather (the patriarch, of course, or even the warlord if you like) of the past and the present, and then, as must always be the case, comes a new godfather. What is fascinating is who this new godfather is and how he comes to power. The ending of the film is--after so many brilliant scenes and so many psychologically true surprises and so many excursions to Queens and the Bronx and Sicily and Las Vegas (each vignette absolutely integrated into the story of the film)--even more ponderously true and a surprise that sneaks up on us so stealthily that it is not a surprise. And when the credits begin to run after Diana Keaton's tears of realization, we too realize the ""message"" of the film. It is a message that I think would be understood in the Middle East today (and two thousand years ago as well) as I write this, a message of tribal ways and the rise and fall of warlords and the Machiavellian machinations of the prince who would be king.But it is Al Pacino's performance as the son of the godfather that in the final analysis steals the show as he goes from the intellectual boy who would be a legitimate American success at the finest colleges, etc. to a man wearing the hat of Al Capone. And Pacino makes us believe every step of the way.Well, I should not say that it Al Pacino who steals the show. In truth this is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece. He would not have the film he has without Al Pacino or Marlon Brandon and certainly not without the novel and script from Mario Puzo, of course; but make no mistake about it. Coppola manicured every scene. He attended to every detail, from the color of the wine to the tires on the cars to the dances and the music to the villas abroad to the sleaze of Las Vegas to the perfect casting of the main characters right down to the extras including both cute and not so cute kids, as indeed life would give us. In some very real sense Coppola lived this movie and it was a part of him, and yet I am stuck by the fact that Puzo invented it.This is an American classic, an uncompromising work of art that engages, informs and moves the audience--just about any audience--to ask the great questions regarding who we are and what we should do and how we should live. From the wedding to the funeral to the christening to the priest in Latin voice-over as the final vengeance is planned to that final vengeance (that we know will NOT be the final vengeance), we are glued to our seats as the life of human beings (who could very well be us) passes before our transfixed eyes.Oscars went to Brando as best actor, and to Puzo and Coppola for best screen adaptation. In a rare show of almost universal agreement among movie goers, critics, and the Academy, The Godfather won the Oscar as Best Picture in 1972.Don't miss this as I had for so long, and see it for Coppola who can take his place among the greats of all cinema for this film alone.",5,One of the best ever made,1101168000,"11 23, 2004",2004,4599,"['one', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Any', 'doubt', 'can', 'be', 'dispelled', 'watching', 'movie', 'missed', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'then', 'curious', 'thing', 'happened', 'reason', 'thought', 'had', 'seen', 'film', 'One', 'decade', 'then', 'two', 'went', 'kept', 'hearing', 'what', 'great', 'film', 'Godfather', 'was', 'was', 'unimpressed', 'thought', 'had', 'seen', 'it.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'film', 'had', 'seen', 'was', ""n't"", 'Godfather', 'Seeing', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'thirty', 'years', 'fact', 'production', 'startling', 'experience', 'Godfather', 'work', 'art', 'first', 'scene', 'last', 'most', 'amazing', 'adherence', 'fiction', 'truer', 'fact.I', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'played', 'cards', 'Mario', 'Puzo', 'who', 'wrote', 'novel', 'film', 'was', 'adapted', 'who', 'famously', 'worked', 'Coppola', 'screenplay', 'fact', 'only', 'played', 'cards', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'played', 'cards', 'Puzo', 'Ah', 'such', 'effect', 'celebrity', 'Puzo', 'became', 'Coppola', 'something', 'legend', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'everybody', 'suddenly', 'knew', 'played', 'cards', 'Everybody', 'most', 'unsophisticated', 'celluloid', 'fan', 'most', 'erudite', 'jaded', 'critic', 'had', 'walked', 'theater', '171', 'minutes', 'mesmerized', 'delighted', 'emotionally', 'moved', 'uncompromising', 'look', 'not', 'just', 'Mafia', 'family', 'psychology', 'families', 'time', 'immemorial', 'truth', 'have', 'lived', 'experienced', 'was', 'made', 'large', 'screen', 'form', 'Corleones', 'can', 'guarantee', 'audiences', 'culture', 'planet', 'would', 'understand', 'underlying', 'psychology', 'movie', 'take', 'serious', 'extent', 'own.Marlon', 'Brando', 'godfather', 'patriarch', 'course', 'even', 'warlord', 'like', 'past', 'present', 'then', 'must', 'always', 'be', 'case', 'new', 'godfather', 'What', 'fascinating', 'who', 'new', 'godfather', 'how', 'power', 'ending', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'brilliant', 'scenes', 'so', 'many', 'psychologically', 'true', 'surprises', 'so', 'many', 'excursions', 'Queens', 'Bronx', 'Sicily', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'vignette', 'absolutely', 'integrated', 'story', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'ponderously', 'true', 'surprise', 'up', 'so', 'stealthily', 'not', 'surprise', 'when', 'credits', 'begin', 'run', 'Diana', 'Keaton', 'tears', 'realization', 'too', 'realize', 'message', 'film', 'message', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'understood', 'Middle', 'East', 'today', 'two', 'thousand', 'years', 'ago', 'as', 'well', 'write', 'message', 'tribal', 'ways', 'rise', 'fall', 'warlords', 'Machiavellian', 'machinations', 'prince', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'king.But', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'performance', 'son', 'godfather', 'final', 'analysis', 'show', 'intellectual', 'boy', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'legitimate', 'American', 'success', 'finest', 'colleges', 'etc', 'man', 'wearing', 'hat', 'Al', 'Capone', 'Pacino', 'believe', 'step', 'way.Well', 'should', 'not', 'say', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'who', 'show', 'truth', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'masterpiece', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'film', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Marlon', 'Brandon', 'certainly', 'not', 'novel', 'script', 'Mario', 'Puzo', 'course', 'make', 'mistake', 'Coppola', 'manicured', 'scene', 'attended', 'detail', 'color', 'wine', 'tires', 'cars', 'dances', 'music', 'villas', 'abroad', 'sleaze', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'perfect', 'casting', 'main', 'characters', 'right', 'down', 'extras', 'including', 'cute', 'not', 'so', 'cute', 'kids', 'indeed', 'life', 'would', 'give', 'very', 'real', 'sense', 'Coppola', 'lived', 'movie', 'was', 'part', 'yet', 'am', 'stuck', 'fact', 'Puzo', 'invented', 'it.This', 'American', 'classic', 'uncompromising', 'work', 'art', 'informs', 'audience', 'just', 'audience', 'ask', 'great', 'questions', 'regarding', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'how', 'should', 'live', 'wedding', 'funeral', 'christening', 'priest', 'Latin', 'voice-over', 'final', 'vengeance', 'planned', 'final', 'vengeance', 'know', 'will', 'NOT', 'be', 'final', 'vengeance', 'are', 'glued', 'seats', 'life', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'transfixed', 'eyes.Oscars', 'went', 'Brando', 'best', 'actor', 'Puzo', 'Coppola', 'best', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'rare', 'show', 'almost', 'universal', 'agreement', 'movie', 'goers', 'critics', 'Academy', 'Godfather', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', '1972.Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'had', 'so', 'long', 'see', 'Coppola', 'who', 'can', 'take', 'place', 'greats', 'cinema', 'film', 'alone']",The Godfather VHS

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[29, 38]","I stumbled across this classic on cable TV a few evenings ago and that was it:  I abandoned all other plans for the evening and watched the movie.  Then I retrieved Mario Puzo's novel from my book collection and plowed through it, savoring and relishing this extraordinary piece of literature that had such an impact on our cultural landscape thirty-plus years ago.Francis Ford Coppola's THE GODFATHER is a triumphant, magnificent screen portrayal of Puzo's epic book.  The story of an Italian-American mob &quot;family&quot; entrenched in inherent and often desperate violence, Coppola weaves this film with compelling, moving, and haunting visuals that are as beautiful as they are disturbing.  The scenes are at once simplistic and complex, yet such a dichotomy is not lost on the viewer, but embraced--appreciated for its overwhelming genius.I've seen more than my fair share of Marlon Brando films, and in my opinion the character of Don Vito Corleone is this actor's signature role.  Brando effectively portrays the Godfather's compassion, love and devotion to his family, and calm acumen to make &quot;business&quot; decisions that literally mean life or death to countless men.  Don Vito is both a family man and a killer:  two seemingly inconsistent characteristics that make Brando's portrayal even more remarkable.  The rest of the cast, including James Caan and Robert Duvall, is exceptional, but it is Al Pacino as young Michael Corleone--Don Vito's &quot;baby boy&quot; who was not meant to enter the family business--who provides the most telling role in this film.  Before our very eyes, we see Michael change from a man eager to remain at arms-length to the Corleone family ventures to a ruthless, cold-blooded Godfather himself--a transformation both astounding and eery.THE GODFATHER is a feast of unforgettable cinematic moments:  from an ambush at a toll booth to a bloody horse head wrapped in satin sheets.  Puzo's story is told--told through filmmaking as good as it gets.--D.

What a wonderful job the director does! The story follows events in post-World War II  America where the mantle of Corleone family boss or Godfather is passed on.  The family is more than just next of kin but a network of hitmen,  racketeers, businessmen and wider connections in society. This story  unfolds to reveal a truth common to changes in power structures down  through history. The story telling is second to none. The sense of  importance and significance in each of the events and how it affects the  characters is masterfully played. From the wedding scene introducing the  characters and the peculiarities of the family, both regular and criminal,  to the assassinations while the crime boss renounces satan and all his  works at his sons christening, there is a depth of truth on how real these  events are. Hence the phrase &quot;It's business not personal&quot; the  family members use for justification. The choices people make and how they  make them is shown. The pull of family against individuality is  particularly strong in this movies explanation of the forces at work in a  persons life. It might go to explain the movies popularity. As well as this  the film has great depth with strong mythical elements in the background  like the Italian Catholic tradition.

His organized criminal empire is based on gambling, prostitution, and liquor sales but when another mob leader named Sollozo makes a deal to sell narcotics, Vito refuses because of his devotion to the family code of honor.Sollozo, feeling angered at Vito's refusal orders his assassination but after Vito is severely wounded in a failed murder attempt, his son Michael, who wants nothing to do with the crime is forced into the underworld to protect his father. A vicious cycle of murders happens again and again as mobsters enact revenge against each other.This movie is just amazing and is a dark and dramatic insight into the damage that organized crime has on the innocent civilians as well as the gang members themselves. One scene was where Michael after killing McClusky and Sollozo flees to Sicily and marries an Italian women only for her to be killed in a roadside bomb planted by hitmen who tracked him down to Sicily.This and the two sequels are among the greatest movies ever filmed and you must go out and buy them right away!",5,Outstanding achievement!,1092096000,"08 10, 2004",2004,1253,"['Godfather', 'arguably', 'one', 'favorite', 'movie', 'time.The', 'movie', 'Don', 'Vito', 'Corleone', 'daughter', 'getting', 'married', 'post-war', 'period', 'Vito', 'been', 'keeping', 'home', 'organized', 'criminal', 'empire', 'based', 'gambling', 'prostitution', 'liquor', 'sales', 'when', 'mob', 'leader', 'named', 'Sollozo', 'deal', 'sell', 'narcotics', 'Vito', 'devotion', 'family', 'code', 'honor.Sollozo', 'feeling', 'angered', 'Vito', 'refusal', 'orders', 'assassination', 'Vito', 'severely', 'wounded', 'failed', 'murder', 'attempt', 'son', 'Michael', 'who', 'nothing', 'do', 'crime', 'forced', 'underworld', 'protect', 'father', 'vicious', 'cycle', 'murders', 'happens', 'again', 'again', 'mobsters', 'enact', 'revenge', 'other.This', 'movie', 'just', 'amazing', 'dark', 'dramatic', 'insight', 'damage', 'organized', 'crime', 'innocent', 'civilians', 'as', 'well', 'gang', 'members', 'One', 'scene', 'was', 'where', 'Michael', 'killing', 'McClusky', 'Sollozo', 'flees', 'Sicily', 'marries', 'Italian', 'women', 'only', 'be', 'killed', 'roadside', 'bomb', 'planted', 'hitmen', 'who', 'tracked', 'down', 'Sicily.This', 'two', 'sequels', 'are', 'greatest', 'movies', 'ever', 'filmed', 'must', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'right', 'away']",The Godfather VHS

But it is my favorite movie of all time.  I can't say it was catching lightening in a bottle, as several of the actors were famous before, and several more continue to be popular today.  Although it is one of those rare achievements where the cinema version outshines it's literary equivalent.Movies have the power to create worlds entirely different to us, and in a sense, ""The Godfather"" is one of those movies.  Yes, there is organized crime, and yes, they still seem to have ""families"" to distinguish one group from another.  But this movie still created a different world by having no character that was not part of this world in the cast.  They are either involved in something illegal, or related to someone who is.With this isolation, it makes us look at the film differently than if there were so-called ""honest"" people as part of the movie.  If that were the case, it would be easier to be reminded that these people are criminals.  And not just petty ones.  We see murderers, big time drug dealers, and those that spend large dollars corrupting the so-called ""legitimate"" government.Since everyone is more or less playing by these rules, it then makes it easier to root for what would be the bad guys otherwise.  Vito Corleone has murdered, and ordered the murders of others.  But since we have not been told of the innocent people that were probably killed as part of his ascension, and the fact that he was not eager to get into big-time drug operations, and he was just, well, a grandfatherly old man, he's the ""good guy"" over that dastardly Barzini.So we care that he truly loves his daughter and wants to give her a good wedding.  We think he's a good guy because he didn't want ""all of this"" for Michael.  And we agree that when he says ""a man who does not spend time with his family is not a real man"", that this is wisdom from what must be a very wise man.  Showing that this type of family can indeed love and care for each other while still taking care of business is what makes the film great in my eyes.",5,The best there ever was,1042502400,"01 14, 2003",2003,2132,"['what', 'can', 'be', 'written', 'movie', ""n't"", 'been', 'said', 'million', 'times', 'already', 'Probably', 'nothing', 'favorite', 'movie', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'catching', 'lightening', 'bottle', 'several', 'actors', 'were', 'famous', 'before', 'several', 'more', 'continue', 'be', 'popular', 'today', 'one', 'rare', 'achievements', 'where', 'cinema', 'version', 'literary', 'equivalent.Movies', 'have', 'power', 'create', 'worlds', 'entirely', 'different', 'sense', 'Godfather', 'one', 'movies', 'Yes', 'organized', 'crime', 'yes', 'still', 'seem', 'have', 'families', 'distinguish', 'one', 'group', 'movie', 'still', 'created', 'different', 'world', 'having', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'part', 'world', 'cast', 'are', 'involved', 'something', 'illegal', 'related', 'someone', 'who', 'is.With', 'isolation', 'look', 'film', 'differently', 'were', 'so-called', 'honest', 'people', 'part', 'movie', 'were', 'case', 'would', 'be', 'easier', 'be', 'reminded', 'people', 'are', 'criminals', 'not', 'just', 'petty', 'ones', 'see', 'murderers', 'big', 'time', 'drug', 'dealers', 'spend', 'large', 'dollars', 'corrupting', 'so-called', 'legitimate', 'government.Since', 'everyone', 'more', 'less', 'playing', 'rules', 'then', 'easier', 'root', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'bad', 'guys', 'otherwise', 'Vito', 'Corleone', 'murdered', 'ordered', 'murders', 'others', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'told', 'innocent', 'people', 'were', 'probably', 'killed', 'part', 'ascension', 'fact', 'was', 'not', 'eager', 'get', 'big-time', 'drug', 'operations', 'was', 'just', 'well', 'grandfatherly', 'old', 'man', 'good', 'guy', 'dastardly', 'Barzini.So', 'care', 'daughter', 'give', 'good', 'wedding', 'think', 'good', 'guy', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'Michael', 'agree', 'when', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'spend', 'time', 'family', 'not', 'real', 'man', 'wisdom', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'wise', 'man', 'Showing', 'type', 'family', 'can', 'indeed', 'love', 'care', 'other', 'still', 'taking', 'care', 'business', 'what', 'film', 'great', 'eyes']",The Godfather VHS

The movie does look a bit grainy, but far from distracting the grain gives the movie a 1950s look appropriate to the era.The characterization is absolutely engrossing. Far more than almost any other film I can think of, The Godfather creates complex characters with genuinely ambiguous morals. The movie is never so fascicle as to treat any of the characters as good or evil, heroes or villains. The film never depicts the ""mafia"" as a whole is good or evil, but rather shows the tensions and moral compromises of life in the moral grey zone.

490590,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B000003KHS,Eric S. Kim,"[0, 0]","Countless critics believe that Citizen Kane is the greatest film of all time. While I do admire Orson Welles, I don't necessarily count Citizen Kane as my top favorite classic. Not even Lawrence of Arabia or Schindler's List or It's a Wonderful Life (despite being spectacular masterpieces in their own right) are at the top of my own list. So which film IS at the top? Well, take a look at the DVD cover on this Amazon page, and it should be very obvious . . .This is Francis Ford Coppola's greatest work of art, and without a doubt one of the finest motion pictures to ever be released. It may be overrated by some, but to me, this is the one that will last a lifetime. I won't go into full detail of the plot, but I will tell you that the concept of mobsters being psychologically complex is particulary stunning (not only because it was highly unusual at the time, but because it makes everything in the film so unique). Scarface and Goodfellas had it good also, but this is the original that you ""can't refuse"".However, those who have not yet seen this film and are expecting some typical Hollywood action and adventure will be highly disappointed. This is a drama film, but a brilliant drama film. The tension between characters, the atmosphere in every interior settings, the dialogue, the music, and the heavily brutal violence are almost perfect from beginning to end. The acting in this film is also extraordinary. Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Keaton, Vigoda, Lettieri, and Castellano give flawless performances. They're believable in their roles, and they never overact.It's almost hard to believe that this was filmed with a low budget, but Coppola and his crew were able to pull it all off.

A lot come close (`Citizen  Kane', `Casablanca', etc.) but `The Godfather' has been proven a perennial  favorite between the audience since it's release over 25 years ago, and  still stands well. It is virtuoso filmmaking at it's absolute best,  everything from directing and acting to writing and score are done to  perfection. Never a dull moment in the film, not a slow scene, not a bum  performance and nothing seems out of place. Coppola's first major film and  certainly his best, this was the offspring of his creative talent. His  direction in this film is flawless, every little detail fits together, and  even the casting was inspired, to create a moving and even nostalgic movie  experience. The acting is unbelievable a powerhouse ensemble cast, few  actors have worked so well together and in such beautifully synchronized  harmony, you really believe that this people are family. Marlon Brando, in  one of his definitive roles, delivers one of the best performances in his  career and in movie history. His portrayal of Don Corleone is  unforgettable, powerhouse method acting at the highest level. And also his  physical and emotional transformation from `aging Don' to `old Don' is pure  brilliance. Brando will be remembered as one of the greatest actors of his  generation and it will be mainly because of this film, and of course  because of his other great performances in films like `A Streetcar Named  Desire' and `On The Waterfront'. Al Pacino also delivers what may well be  his best performance ever as Michael, even though he was equally good in  `The Godfather Part II'. Some of his scenes, namely the spellbinding murder  of Sollozzo and McCluskey, are so well acted it's scary. Robert Duvall is  also very impressive as Tom Hagen. James Caan delivers an astounding  performance as hot-headed Sonny, and John Cazale is equally compelling as  dim-witted Fredo, his character plays a small part here but would be  further developed in `The Godfather Part II'. As for the female cast, Diane  Keaton (in her pre-Woody Allen days) is perfect as the shut-out Kay. Talia  Shire, who also happens to be Coppola's sister, was an inspired choice to  play Connie, and even though she plays a small role here, she would grow as  an actress and her character would also grow more important in `The  Godfather Part II'. Richard S. Castellano and Abe Vigoda are typecast as  Don Corleone's Caporegime; Clemenza and Tessio respectively, they are  perfect in their roles, and even though they don't get any big scenes  they're still unforgettable. And then there's a whole line of memorable  supporting characters of which I'll name only a few; Jack Woltz (John  Marley), Barzini (Richard Conte), Sollozzo (Al Lettieri), Luca Brasi (Lenny  Montana), Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), etc. And then there's Al Martino as  Johnny Fontaine who is more than quietly made to resemble Frank Sinatra,  who was also rumored to be the Godson of an Italian family that may or may  not be mixed up in dirty business. Many say that this is the way he got the  part in `From Here To Eternity' that won him an Oscar. Then there are the  technical aspects of the film, which are dazzling. The Coppola-Puzo script  is perfection, memorable dialogue throughout and not one line of dialogue  seems out of place. The script follows no formulas or cliches it instead  created them. Easily among the best screenplays ever written. Gordon  Willis' dark cinematography is atmospheric, deeply evocative and captures  the film's essence perfectly. Coppola flew to Italy specifically to find  Nino Rota, who scored some of Fellini's films, to make the famous musical  score for `The Godfather'. He created one of the most famous scores of all  time, a haunting score that at the same time exudes nostalgia. To finish, I  want to say that this is not a crime film or an action film, it has those  elements in the plot, but it's basically a movie about family and the  succession of power through the generations. `The Godfather' remains one of  the most moving, expertly crafted films of all time and will always remain  as my all-time favorite.

490596,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B000003KHS,"""flickjunkie""","[8, 10]","Often mentioned among the greatest films of all time (#3 on AFI's top  100), ""The Godfather"" brings us an intimate look at a Mafia crime family.  America has always had a romantic fascination with organized crime and this  film takes us inside ""The Family"" like never before.The script is nearly  flawless.  The dialogue is engaging and emotional and the pace never lets  up.  The story is mesmerizing.  The characters are so carefully and  intimately developed that we can't help but get emotionally involved with  them.  Though the violence is graphic and disturbing, it is never random or  gratuitous and always has a direct link to a vital plot element.However,  the appeal of this film goes beyond its great script to the characters and  the actors who played them.  The ensemble has such amazing chemistry that  it hard to imagine they are not actually related to one another.  They have  such charisma that we fall in love with every member of this band of  ruthless criminals, despite their moral decadence.  We come to understand  that they are immoral by our standards, but not amoral, since they have  their own codes of honor that they take very seriously.Though this was  more of an ensemble piece than the sequels, two actors clearly stand out,  namely Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.  Brando was already an established  superstar at that point, although he hadn't had a meaty role in a few  years.  His performance as Don Vito was powerful and commanding.  Outstanding as he was, it was probably not his best performance (See ""On  The Waterfront"", ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", or ""Mutiny On The Bounty""),  yet it is the one for which he is most famous.  Brando redefined our  notions of the mafia patriarch from that of a ruthless dictator, to a  shrewd diplomat who only wielded power when absolutely necessary.  He  presented him as a potent but sympathetic character with a cunning mind and  an astute understanding of the human dynamics of the other  families.Pacino, in contrast, was a fresh face with only two films to  his credit at that time.  Despite his lack of film experience, he delivered  a tour de force performance portraying a complex character that required a  great deal of range.  Michael Corleone starts as a goody two shoes and is  ultimately hardened into a cold-blooded crime boss, with a touching  romantic interlude along the way.  Pacino shined in every scene and  established himself as one of the truly great actors of our time.Other  standouts include Robert Duvall and James Caan, who was brilliant as the  hot headed Sonny Corleone.  Caan's performance was raw, brutal and  visceral, yet he somehow was able to render Sonny a magnetic and charming  character with a strong sense of family loyalty.This film was nominated  for nine Academy Awards in 1973 and won three, including Best Actor for  Brando and Best Picture.  It is one of the very few videos that I actually  own.  It is hard to imagine that anyone born before 1982 hasn't seen it  yet, but if you haven't, you should make it the very next film you see.  It  is an utterly perfect 10.",5,An enduring classic,968371200,"09 8, 2000",2000,3089,"['Often', 'mentioned', 'greatest', 'films', 'time', '3', 'AFI', 'top', '100', 'Godfather', 'intimate', 'look', 'Mafia', 'crime', 'family', 'America', 'always', 'had', 'romantic', 'fascination', 'organized', 'crime', 'film', 'Family', 'never', 'before.The', 'script', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'dialogue', 'engaging', 'emotional', 'pace', 'never', 'up', 'story', 'mesmerizing', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'carefully', 'intimately', 'developed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'violence', 'graphic', 'disturbing', 'never', 'random', 'gratuitous', 'always', 'direct', 'link', 'vital', 'plot', 'element.However', 'appeal', 'film', 'great', 'script', 'characters', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'ensemble', 'such', 'amazing', 'chemistry', 'hard', 'imagine', 'are', 'not', 'actually', 'related', 'one', 'have', 'such', 'charisma', 'fall', 'love', 'member', 'band', 'ruthless', 'criminals', 'moral', 'decadence', 'come', 'understand', 'are', 'immoral', 'standards', 'not', 'amoral', 'have', 'own', 'codes', 'honor', 'take', 'very', 'seriously.Though', 'was', 'more', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'sequels', 'two', 'actors', 'clearly', 'stand', 'out', 'namely', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Brando', 'was', 'already', 'established', 'superstar', 'point', 'had', ""n't"", 'had', 'meaty', 'role', 'few', 'years', 'performance', 'Don', 'Vito', 'was', 'powerful', 'commanding', 'Outstanding', 'was', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'best', 'performance', 'See', 'Waterfront', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'Mutiny', 'Bounty', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'Brando', 'redefined', 'notions', 'mafia', 'patriarch', 'ruthless', 'dictator', 'shrewd', 'diplomat', 'who', 'only', 'wielded', 'power', 'when', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'presented', 'potent', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'cunning', 'mind', 'astute', 'understanding', 'human', 'dynamics', 'other', 'families.Pacino', 'contrast', 'was', 'fresh', 'face', 'only', 'two', 'films', 'credit', 'time', 'lack', 'film', 'experience', 'delivered', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'portraying', 'complex', 'character', 'required', 'great', 'deal', 'range', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'goody', 'two', 'shoes', 'ultimately', 'hardened', 'cold-blooded', 'crime', 'boss', 'touching', 'romantic', 'interlude', 'way', 'Pacino', 'shined', 'scene', 'established', 'one', 'truly', 'great', 'actors', 'time.Other', 'standouts', 'include', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'James', 'Caan', 'who', 'was', 'brilliant', 'hot', 'headed', 'Sonny', 'Corleone', 'Caan', 'performance', 'was', 'raw', 'brutal', 'visceral', 'yet', 'somehow', 'was', 'able', 'render', 'Sonny', 'magnetic', 'charming', 'character', 'strong', 'sense', 'family', 'loyalty.This', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'nine', 'Academy', 'Awards', '1973', 'won', 'three', 'including', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Brando', 'Best', 'Picture', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'videos', 'actually', 'own', 'hard', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'born', '1982', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'have', ""n't"", 'should', 'make', 'very', 'next', 'film', 'see', 'utterly', 'perfect', '10']",The Godfather VHS

I certainly would not be one to argue because it has so many extraordinary aspects. You have Brando as the title character and a great cast of others who reveal the honor as well as the brutality of this lifestyle. However this film is not just about the violence. It is complex and fascinating in many other ways. Starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall, with director Francis Ford Coppola, this is possibly one of the greatest films ever. It begins at a wedding in the 1940s as Don Vito Corrleone takes care of some ""business"" as head of the family. All too soon it becomes evident that the Don is loyal to his friends and ruthless to those in his way. His youngest son Michael returns from the war and wants nothing to do with the business but at the same time conflict blows up when the family does not back a heroin dealer. When the Don comes close to death Michael finally gets involved. After a series of events he becomes head of the family and soon proves how powerful he can be.

490598,A22ZL73VVI6OY8,B000003KHS,"Franken Sense ""frankensense""","[0, 0]","I believe that a confluence of factors make this the greatest film ever. A young and starving Coppola, steadfast in his artistic integrity, fighting for his vision of exactly what the film should be over the objections of studio bigwigs.In retrospect, a cast of truly brilliant actors, that likely could never again be duplicated. At the time, Brando was the great know quantity, but in decline and perfectly cast (initially with the studio at odds with Coppola with regards to hiring Brando) as a dying Godfather. The rest of the hall of fame cast was, relatively speaking, not particularly well-known at the time. As a result, the actors themselves do not detract from the film. We are not watching Pacino or Duvall give a typical ""Pacino"" or ""Duvall"" performance, but rather we are watching them as the characters themselves.Putting aside for a moment the ruthless and immoral nature of the Mafia, the cinematography, editing, and overall pace of the film create an atmosphere where the viewer becomes immersed in a film that has a ""home movie"" type quality, where you are almost there and you actually feel for some of these people. No small feat considering the subject matter at hand and a tribute to Coppola's deft early touch. But Coppola's direction doesn't let the viewer get too attached as he provides an underlying, yet subtle, fatalistic tension throughout the whole affair.For me the ending is the icing on the cake, one of the great endings of all time.

490602,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B000003KHS,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[2, 4]","Mario Puzo was a critically respected but little known Italian-American writer when he published the 1969 novel THE GODFATHER, a book he himself described as a deliberately commercial work with roots in earlier pulp fiction genres and the plot and characters loosely based on various New York organized crime figures and associates.  Puzo worked with director Francis Ford Coppola to adapt the novel to the screen, and the 1972 film was a spectacular success, loved by the public, acclaimed by the critics, and receiving an armload of awards.  That success spawned an equally successful sequel, THE GODFATHER PART II in 1974, and a significantly less successful sequel, THE GODFATHER PART III, in 1990.  And therein lies a certain problem, for the three films have been re-cut, inter-cut, and fiddled with to such an extent that is actually now a little difficult to see the 1972 THE GODFATHER as it originally appeared.  There are so many versions that it is confusing, but the best guess seems to be the 2006 Paramount widescreen DVD release, which clocks in at 175 minutes--the same run time of the original release.The story, as virtually every film-goer knows, concerns the Corleone family, which is led by patriarch Don Vito Corleone.  The film opens in the late 1940s on his daughter's wedding day, during which Don Corleone receives requests for favors--favors that range from punishing two would-be rapists to securing a film deal for fading star Johnny Fontaine (a character widely believed, in spite of Puzo's protests, to be based on Frank Sinatra.)  Once the characters are established, the film gets underway with mafia trips to Los Angeles and Las Vegas, an attempted hit on Don Vito Corleone, and the Corleone response that leads to a massive gang war, all of this served up with lush production values, remarkably rich ""color noir"" photography, and significant violence.  And then, of course, there are the performances.  Quite simply, was the peak for all concerned.  From Marlon Brando to Al Pachino, from Talia Shire to an unexpectedly cast Diane Keaton, not a single of the cast ever gave a better performance or appeared in a finer film, and certainly director Francis Ford Coppola, in spite of several famous and widely lauded films, never again reached quite the same heights.Even so, the original THE GODFATHER is somewhat unexpected, and if you haven't seen in some time you may be surprised.  At the time it was considered extremely violent, but in fact most of the violence is implied and that which is shown is seen from a distance, or quickly displayed, or in some other form somewhat underplayed--both the earlier BONNIE AND CLYDE and the later GOODFELLAS are much, much, much more graphically violent films.  What does set the violence of THE GODFATHER apart, however, is that it is remarkably cold.  ""It's business,"" the characters repeatedly say to each other, and the violence involved is performed in a business-like, usually dismissive manner.  Perhaps more disconcerting is how languid and episodic the film is: the pace is generally calm, even to the point of swan-like graciousness, and the story meanders through the lives of the characters without the usual beginning-middle-end structure most American moviegoers expect.  To a certain extent, one can actually describe THE GODFATHER as something of an art film, something distinctly atypical of American movies of the 1970s and even more atypical of American movies as they exist today.Many critics regard THE GODFATHER as the single finest crime film ever made.  I would not go quite that far--I think the 1974 CHINATOWN and the 1990 GOODFELLAS equal it.  Many critics regard it as the second best American film overall, following closely behind the 1941 CITIZEN KANE.  Again, I would not go quite that far; there are many, many films that vie for the title of ""best,"" too many for anyone's designation to be more than trivial opinion.  Even so, I think it is entirely safe to say that THE GODFATHER, the film that was originally shown on 1972 screens, has stood the test of time--and will go on doing so for as long as motion pictures are shown.  The 2006 Paramount DVD contains nothing in the way of bonus material, and if you want that you'll have to go to a boxed set or some other incarnation of the film.  But THE GODFATHER is good enough to stand on its own without the support of bonus material.  In the end, it is the film that counts, and THE GODFATHER is indeed a truly great one.GFT, Amazon ReviewerIn Memory of Roscoe, Faithful Companion, 1999-2011",5,An Offer You Can't Refuse: One of the Finest Films Ever Made,1299024000,"03 2, 2011",2011,4555,"['Mario', 'Puzo', 'was', 'critically', 'respected', 'little', 'known', 'Italian-American', 'writer', 'when', 'published', '1969', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'book', 'described', 'deliberately', 'commercial', 'work', 'roots', 'earlier', 'pulp', 'fiction', 'genres', 'plot', 'characters', 'loosely', 'based', 'various', 'New', 'York', 'organized', 'crime', 'figures', 'associates', 'Puzo', 'worked', 'director', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'adapt', 'novel', 'screen', '1972', 'film', 'was', 'spectacular', 'success', 'loved', 'public', 'acclaimed', 'critics', 'receiving', 'armload', 'awards', 'success', 'spawned', 'equally', 'successful', 'sequel', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'PART', 'II', '1974', 'significantly', 'less', 'successful', 'sequel', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'PART', 'III', '1990', 'therein', 'certain', 'problem', 'three', 'films', 'have', 'been', 're-cut', 'inter-cut', 'fiddled', 'extent', 'actually', 'now', 'little', 'difficult', 'see', '1972', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'originally', 'appeared', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'versions', 'confusing', 'best', 'guess', 'be', '2006', 'Paramount', 'widescreen', 'DVD', 'release', '175', 'minutes', 'same', 'run', 'time', 'original', 'release.The', 'story', 'virtually', 'film-goer', 'knows', 'Corleone', 'family', 'led', 'patriarch', 'Don', 'Vito', 'Corleone', 'film', 'late', '1940s', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'day', 'Don', 'Corleone', 'requests', 'favors', 'favors', 'range', 'punishing', 'two', 'would-be', 'rapists', 'securing', 'film', 'deal', 'fading', 'star', 'Johnny', 'Fontaine', 'character', 'widely', 'believed', 'spite', 'Puzo', 'protests', 'be', 'based', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'characters', 'are', 'established', 'film', 'underway', 'mafia', 'trips', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'attempted', 'hit', 'Don', 'Vito', 'Corleone', 'Corleone', 'response', 'massive', 'gang', 'war', 'served', 'up', 'lush', 'production', 'values', 'remarkably', 'rich', 'color', 'noir', 'photography', 'significant', 'violence', 'then', 'course', 'are', 'performances', 'Quite', 'simply', 'was', 'peak', 'concerned', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Al', 'Pachino', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'unexpectedly', 'cast', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'not', 'single', 'cast', 'ever', 'gave', 'better', 'performance', 'appeared', 'finer', 'film', 'certainly', 'director', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'spite', 'several', 'famous', 'widely', 'lauded', 'films', 'never', 'again', 'reached', 'quite', 'same', 'heights.Even', 'so', 'original', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'somewhat', 'unexpected', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'time', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'time', 'was', 'considered', 'extremely', 'violent', 'fact', 'most', 'violence', 'implied', 'shown', 'seen', 'distance', 'quickly', 'displayed', 'other', 'form', 'somewhat', 'underplayed', 'earlier', 'BONNIE', 'AND', 'CLYDE', 'later', 'GOODFELLAS', 'are', 'much', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'graphically', 'violent', 'films', 'What', 'set', 'violence', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'apart', 'however', 'remarkably', 'cold', 'business', 'characters', 'repeatedly', 'say', 'other', 'violence', 'involved', 'performed', 'business-like', 'usually', 'dismissive', 'manner', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'disconcerting', 'how', 'languid', 'film', 'pace', 'generally', 'calm', 'even', 'point', 'swan-like', 'graciousness', 'story', 'meanders', 'lives', 'characters', 'usual', 'beginning-middle-end', 'structure', 'most', 'American', 'moviegoers', 'expect', 'certain', 'extent', 'one', 'can', 'actually', 'describe', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'something', 'art', 'film', 'something', 'distinctly', 'atypical', 'American', 'movies', '1970s', 'even', 'more', 'atypical', 'American', 'movies', 'exist', 'today.Many', 'critics', 'regard', 'GODFATHER', 'single', 'finest', 'crime', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'would', 'not', 'go', 'quite', 'far', 'think', '1974', 'CHINATOWN', '1990', 'GOODFELLAS', 'equal', 'Many', 'critics', 'regard', 'second', 'best', 'American', 'film', 'overall', 'following', 'closely', '1941', 'CITIZEN', 'KANE', 'Again', 'would', 'not', 'go', 'quite', 'far', 'are', 'many', 'many', 'films', 'vie', 'title', 'best', 'too', 'many', 'anyone', 'designation', 'be', 'more', 'trivial', 'opinion', 'Even', 'so', 'think', 'entirely', 'safe', 'say', 'GODFATHER', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'shown', '1972', 'screens', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'will', 'go', 'doing', 'so', 'as', 'long', 'motion', 'pictures', 'are', 'shown', '2006', 'Paramount', 'DVD', 'nothing', 'way', 'bonus', 'material', 'want', ""'ll"", 'have', 'go', 'boxed', 'set', 'other', 'incarnation', 'film', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'good', 'enough', 'stand', 'own', 'support', 'bonus', 'material', 'end', 'film', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'indeed', 'truly', 'great', 'one.GFT', 'Amazon', 'ReviewerIn', 'Memory', 'Roscoe', 'Faithful', 'Companion', '1999-2011']",The Godfather VHS

""The Godfather"" is one of those movies. In general, I do not like Mafia movies, and as a result, I felt certain that I would hate this movie, and yet, within the first 15 minutes of starting this film, I found myself drawn into the saga of the Corleone family.It is virtually impossible to find fault with ""The Godfather"". Everything about it is perfect, from the script, to the acting, to the directing. Some negative reviewers have called this film boring, and I will admit that this film is slow moving, but slow moving does not translate into boredom. The pacing of this film is perfect for what it is and it allows the viewer to become fully acquainted with each and every member of the Corleone clan. The only factor that I would say could possibly prevent someone from watching and enjoying this film is the violence. Back in 1972, ""The Godfather"" was considered to be extremely violent, and even by 21st century standards, the violence is still intense and likely to distress some viewers.The only bad thing I can think of about ""The Godfather"" is the unfortunate timing of its release. ""The Godfather"" was released in the same year as ""Cabaret"", another great film, resulting in the Academy Awards for that year being split between the two films (""The Godfather"" got Best Picture and Best Actor, while ""Cabaret"" got Best Director, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor). Both of these films are so good that they deserve all of the above mentioned Oscars (well, with the possible exception of Best Actress, since there was no lead actress in ""The Godfather""), and I just wish that they could have been released in separate years so that they could have achieved just that.",5,A film so great you are forced to like it,1237334400,"03 18, 2009",2009,2017,"['epic', 'saga', 'Mafia', 'family', 'focusing', 'youngest', 'son', 'Michael', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'honest', 'war', 'hero', 'who', 'progressively', 'drawn', 'family', 'business.The', 'mark', 'great', 'movie', 'even', 'have', 'interest', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'made', 'are', 'forced', 'like', 'very', 'least', 'appreciate', 'Godfather', 'one', 'movies', 'general', 'do', 'not', 'Mafia', 'movies', 'result', 'felt', 'certain', 'would', 'hate', 'movie', 'yet', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'starting', 'film', 'found', 'drawn', 'saga', 'Corleone', 'family.It', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'find', 'fault', 'Godfather', 'Everything', 'perfect', 'script', 'acting', 'directing', 'negative', 'reviewers', 'have', 'called', 'film', 'boring', 'will', 'admit', 'film', 'slow', 'moving', 'slow', 'moving', 'not', 'translate', 'boredom', 'pacing', 'film', 'perfect', 'what', 'viewer', 'become', 'fully', 'acquainted', 'member', 'Corleone', 'clan', 'only', 'factor', 'would', 'say', 'could', 'possibly', 'prevent', 'someone', 'watching', 'enjoying', 'film', 'violence', 'Back', '1972', 'Godfather', 'was', 'considered', 'be', 'extremely', 'violent', 'even', '21st', 'century', 'standards', 'violence', 'still', 'intense', 'likely', 'distress', 'viewers.The', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'can', 'think', 'Godfather', 'unfortunate', 'timing', 'release', 'Godfather', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'Cabaret', 'great', 'film', 'resulting', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'year', 'being', 'split', 'two', 'films', 'Godfather', 'got', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Cabaret', 'got', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'deserve', 'above', 'mentioned', 'Oscars', 'well', 'possible', 'exception', 'Best', 'Actress', 'was', 'lead', 'actress', 'Godfather', 'just', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'separate', 'years', 'so', 'could', 'have', 'achieved', 'just']",The Godfather VHS

490606,A2NRJPY8LPHYJL,B000003KHS,ghtx,"[5, 6]","&quot;The Godfather,&quot; directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on the novel written by Mario Puzo, stands as one of the great achievements of American film. Here's three reasons why.The performances. Surprisingly enough, even for people who have seen the movie numerous times, Marlon Brando's not really in it all that much. He won the Oscar for Best (Lead) Actor (which he turned down), he's on the unforgettable film poster, and he's what everyone thinks about when they think about &quot;The Godfather.&quot; But don't be fooled. Though he's unsurpassably great and very worthy of his accolades, he's not the lead, nor is his the best performance in the film. That honor belongs to Al Pacino. In the performance that made him a star and will make him a legend, Pacino exhibits incredible power and elicits extraordinary compassion for a mass murderer. He does this in a far more subtle way than he is wont to do nowadays (including his own Oscar winning turn). The supporting cast is flawless, especially James Caan, Diane Keaton, and the dearly departed John Cazale.The story. Puzo's novel was great, and the film only improved on it. Everyone knows by now that &quot;The Godfather&quot; is not really about the Mafia as much as it's about family. Not just Sicilian families, either. The two central characters in the story are almost wholly motivated by a desire to help the family, and it is for this reason that the film magically manages to portray these people as heroes. Their occupation is secondary; their relationships with their loved ones and how those relationships affect their occupational choices reigns.The scenes. All great films, but especially those of the &quot;Godfather&quot; trilogy, are made of great individual scenes. Witness: the scene in the hospital where Michael attempts to move his father's hospital room to avoid his murder, with the help of Enzo the baker. The immortal opening wedding scene, interspresed with the favor requests (which no Sicilian can turn down on the day of his daughter's wedding). The scene where Michael defines himself as a Corleone, not an American, but a Sicilian living in America, when he murders a mob boss and a corrupt cop in cold blood to avenge the attempt on his father's life. Or was it to avenge his smack in the face? Who knows. I know that it's a great scene, and I'd watch it over and over again just by itself if only all of the other scenes in this film weren't so damned good.That was a few reasons why this movie's great. There are plenty more.

Unfortunately the actions of these family members are so appealing to audiences that it in effect glamorizes a certain lifestyle and singles out a particular ethnic group. However using his great innovative techniques Coppola created a cultural phenomenon. From a cinematic viewpoint Coppola's direction simply wins the viewer over with such grace and appeal that there is no room for ethical consequences. For years director John Ford decimated thousands of American Indians under the watchful eyes of Monument Valley. Nobody seemed to mind much in the end.

Now, it is a beautiful film, very dreamy actually, which I thought was quite interesting considering the core subject matter. I will also say that in my youth, I had some exposure to &#34;the mob&#34; on the West Coast, and frankly who they were, and how they did things, kept my community pretty nice and safe; any rapists or heroin dealers who showed up in town seemed to vanish pretty quickly, as did dirty cops.  That reputation further seemed to keep things pretty nice.  No old woman needing surgery didn't get it, or end up not having food, housing repairs, or anything of that nature.  I would have to go into a long commentary on that subject I guess, getting off track from the film.  But I mentioned it because, based upon my own experience, I found the film to be one of veracity to the core.The only thing that I feel I didn't quite like about this film was that it was ponderous in pacing.  I believe this is strictly a difference in time period from when it was made and when I saw it.  We are used to watching films that have shorter shots with faster editing cuts etc.  So there were some scenes in this which, while incredibly beautiful, seemed to be unnecessarily long to me (such as when the patriarch dies).So just be aware of that factor if you haven't seen this yet, and settle into it, for a rewarding and surprisingly clear insight into an influential subculture affecting American history.",5,I just saw this for the first time,1396224000,"03 31, 2014",2014,1456,"['So', 'am', 'looking', 'modern', 'eyes', 'Now', 'beautiful', 'film', 'very', 'dreamy', 'actually', 'thought', 'was', 'quite', 'interesting', 'considering', 'core', 'subject', 'matter', 'will', 'also', 'say', 'youth', 'had', 'exposure', '34', 'mob', '34', 'West', 'Coast', 'frankly', 'who', 'were', 'how', 'did', 'things', 'kept', 'community', 'pretty', 'nice', 'safe', 'rapists', 'heroin', 'dealers', 'who', 'showed', 'up', 'town', 'seemed', 'vanish', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'did', 'dirty', 'cops', 'reputation', 'further', 'seemed', 'keep', 'things', 'pretty', 'nice', 'old', 'woman', 'needing', 'surgery', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'end', 'up', 'not', 'having', 'food', 'housing', 'repairs', 'anything', 'nature', 'would', 'have', 'go', 'long', 'commentary', 'subject', 'guess', 'getting', 'off', 'track', 'film', 'mentioned', 'based', 'own', 'experience', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'one', 'veracity', 'core.The', 'only', 'thing', 'feel', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'like', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'ponderous', 'pacing', 'believe', 'strictly', 'difference', 'time', 'period', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'when', 'saw', 'are', 'used', 'watching', 'films', 'have', 'shorter', 'shots', 'faster', 'editing', 'cuts', 'etc', 'were', 'scenes', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'seemed', 'be', 'unnecessarily', 'long', 'such', 'when', 'patriarch', '.So', 'just', 'be', 'aware', 'factor', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'settle', 'rewarding', 'surprisingly', 'clear', 'insight', 'influential', 'subculture', 'affecting', 'American', 'history']",The Godfather VHS

490615,A1TMAVN4CEM8U8,B000003KHS,"Gunner ""The GUNNER""","[1, 1]","The GODFATHER DVDThe God father is based upon Mario Puzo's novel of a Sicilian Family moved to the United States circa 1920's.  Don Corleone goes into the  olive oil business, what else would you expect?  He soon learns that it is easier to make money on the wrong side of the law and recruits a small gang of fellow Sicilians.A host of factors make this one of the greatest American films. First, the directing is impeccable. Coppola allows the story to unfold simply, employing for the most part a static, immobile camera, allowing each scene to unfold like a series of tableaux. Second, the cinematography. Most of the craft of the cinematography went into the lighting, which generates some of the greatest use of light and shadows since the demise of black and white film noir. Coppola also intensifies each scene by using surprisingly little music in the film. Although the film is famous for its outstanding score by Nina Rota (later discovered to have been partially reused from an obscure film he scored in the late 1950s in Italy, which led to his nomination for an Oscar to be withdrawn, an award he certainly would have won), the fact is that the music is used selectively and comparatively rarely. Silence engulfs most of the scenes. And although there are many famous lines in the film, it is driven as much by the silence between the characters as by what they say. Also accounting for the brilliance of the film is the script, which is brilliant for its simplicity. Coppola distills the tale down to only the most essential elements, with nearly every shot moving the story along or imparting a crucial piece of information to the viewer, allowing the crucial tensions of the story to unfold early on. The enormous simplicity in the telling of the tale makes the more complex moments for instance, the crosscutting during the baptismal scene all that much more effective. And any listing of all the reasons for the brilliance of the film leaving out the extraordinary art design would be woefully incomplete. This was one of the first films made that made historical accuracy a high art form, and has exerted a profound influence on any historical film since then.Of course, one of the main reasons this is a great, great film is the acting. Few films have ever featured so many memorable performances, and no film had featured so many performances by so many actors who were explicitly Italian. In fact, the film was a  coming out  for one aspect of Italian culture in the United States. Even in films that were fairly transparently about the Mafia and crime families in New York and Chicago, ethnicity was completely left out of the picture. After THE GODFATHER, everything changed. The film was Marlon Brando s triumphant return to star status after a series of failures, garnering a well-served Oscar that he turned down. The quality of the acting is shown by the fact that no less than three of the other actors Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan received nominations for Best Supporting Actor (Joel Grey won for CABERET, in what might have been the greatest group of performances in the history of Oscar for the award).There are a million stories that whirl around THE GODFATHER. My favorite, and one of the happier accidents in casting history, was that originally Robert De Niro was cast in a small part in THE GODFATHER. Al Pacino, on the other hand, was wanted for the part of Michael Corleone, but was already obligated for the film BANG THE DRUM SLOWLY. Francis Ford Coppola worked out a deal whereby De Niro would replace Pacino in the one picture. Unfortunately/fortunately this meant that De Niro was unable to be in THE GODFATHER, which meant that he was free to appear in THE GODFATHER II as the young Vito Corleone. THE GODFATHER was a film where just about everything seemed to work out best for all involved, and this illustrates this perfectly.Highly recommended for fans of Al Pacino, Marlan Brando et. al.and fans of organized crime in AmericaGunner  January 2008",5,I'll make him an offer that he can't refuse,1201132800,"01 24, 2008",2008,4008,"['GODFATHER', 'DVDThe', 'God', 'father', 'based', 'Mario', 'Puzo', 'novel', 'Sicilian', 'Family', 'moved', 'United', 'States', 'circa', '1920', 'Don', 'Corleone', 'olive', 'oil', 'business', 'what', 'else', 'would', 'expect', 'soon', 'easier', 'make', 'money', 'wrong', 'side', 'law', 'small', 'gang', 'fellow', 'Sicilians.A', 'host', 'factors', 'make', 'one', 'greatest', 'American', 'films', 'First', 'directing', 'impeccable', 'Coppola', 'story', 'unfold', 'simply', 'employing', 'most', 'part', 'static', 'immobile', 'camera', 'allowing', 'scene', 'unfold', 'series', 'tableaux', 'Second', 'cinematography', 'Most', 'craft', 'cinematography', 'went', 'lighting', 'greatest', 'use', 'light', 'shadows', 'demise', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'noir', 'Coppola', 'also', 'scene', 'using', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'music', 'film', 'film', 'famous', 'outstanding', 'score', 'Nina', 'Rota', 'later', 'discovered', 'have', 'been', 'partially', 'reused', 'obscure', 'film', 'scored', 'late', '1950s', 'Italy', 'led', 'nomination', 'Oscar', 'be', 'withdrawn', 'award', 'certainly', 'would', 'have', 'won', 'fact', 'music', 'used', 'selectively', 'comparatively', 'rarely', 'Silence', 'engulfs', 'most', 'scenes', 'are', 'many', 'famous', 'lines', 'film', 'driven', 'much', 'silence', 'characters', 'what', 'say', 'Also', 'accounting', 'brilliance', 'film', 'script', 'brilliant', 'simplicity', 'Coppola', 'tale', 'down', 'only', 'most', 'essential', 'elements', 'nearly', 'shot', 'moving', 'story', 'imparting', 'crucial', 'piece', 'information', 'viewer', 'allowing', 'crucial', 'tensions', 'story', 'unfold', 'early', 'enormous', 'simplicity', 'telling', 'tale', 'more', 'complex', 'moments', 'instance', 'crosscutting', 'baptismal', 'scene', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'listing', 'reasons', 'brilliance', 'film', 'leaving', 'out', 'extraordinary', 'art', 'design', 'would', 'be', 'woefully', 'incomplete', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'films', 'made', 'made', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'high', 'art', 'form', 'exerted', 'profound', 'influence', 'historical', 'film', 'then.Of', 'course', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'great', 'great', 'film', 'acting', 'Few', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'featured', 'so', 'many', 'memorable', 'performances', 'film', 'had', 'featured', 'so', 'many', 'performances', 'so', 'many', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'explicitly', 'Italian', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'one', 'aspect', 'Italian', 'culture', 'United', 'States', 'Even', 'films', 'were', 'fairly', 'transparently', 'Mafia', 'crime', 'families', 'New', 'York', 'Chicago', 'ethnicity', 'was', 'completely', 'left', 'out', 'picture', 'GODFATHER', 'everything', 'changed', 'film', 'was', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 's', 'triumphant', 'return', 'star', 'status', 'series', 'failures', 'garnering', 'well-served', 'Oscar', 'turned', 'down', 'quality', 'acting', 'shown', 'fact', 'less', 'three', 'other', 'actors', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'James', 'Caan', 'received', 'nominations', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'won', 'CABERET', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'greatest', 'group', 'performances', 'history', 'Oscar', 'award', 'are', 'million', 'stories', 'whirl', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'My', 'favorite', 'one', 'happier', 'accidents', 'casting', 'history', 'was', 'originally', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'was', 'cast', 'small', 'part', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'wanted', 'part', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'was', 'already', 'obligated', 'film', 'BANG', 'THE', 'DRUM', 'SLOWLY', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'worked', 'out', 'deal', 'whereby', 'De', 'Niro', 'would', 'replace', 'Pacino', 'one', 'picture', 'Unfortunately/fortunately', 'meant', 'De', 'Niro', 'was', 'unable', 'be', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'meant', 'was', 'free', 'appear', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'II', 'young', 'Vito', 'Corleone', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'was', 'film', 'where', 'just', 'everything', 'seemed', 'work', 'out', 'best', 'involved', 'perfectly.Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Marlan', 'Brando', 'et', 'al.and', 'fans', 'organized', 'crime', 'AmericaGunner', 'January', '2008']",The Godfather VHS

Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, it is on many people's list as one of the best American films ever made. Marlon Brando gives as good a performance as he ever gave. I'm not sure you would know he was Brando if you hadn't read the credits already. There are great performances by the supporting actors as well: Dianne Keaton, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Al Pacino in particular who does a marvellous job of growing into the leader of the Corleone family after the death of Brando.Mario Puzo, the author of the novel from which the movie was based, said that he was writing about family. That may be true, but we are dealing here with the family involved in the family business. Two of the most exciting and extended scenes have to do with the most important of family events, a wedding and a christening. Family values? The christening scene in particular is as chilling and effective as anything you'll see in a movie.

The camera (with a photography which reminds us to Visconti in several dramatic sequences) establishes as another actor.The amazing cast was another cosmical achievement.

More than acting Brando established a landmark; he became in a model for this role.But the emerging talents such as Robert de Niro , James Caan, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton and the young raising promise as Al Pacino who had revealed the year before with Serpico, looks like they had established a unspoken commitment, not only with the directorial code, but with themselves.The flow of the story follows the same model as a Symphony in four movements. Coppola will never be effectist with the action sequences; he makes that you feel as logical and the use of the music looks like a voice in off, which makes as a natural link for the work in progress.There are, at least five unforgettable sequences in this legend movie.

490623,AW1493ZQTQ2ET,B000003KHS,Irfan A. Alvi,"[1, 2]","As nearly everyone knows, this movie is about a mob family, and the movie is wonderfully crafted in every aspect.  I found it gripping from start to finish.  The focus is clearly on the men in the family, since the female characters are hardly developed.  Superficially, one might be tempted to say that this is just a story about a particular group of criminals, but of course there's much more to it than that; indeed, this movie is an iconic classic for good reasons.Rather than attempting to write a thorough review which winds up just echoing what countless others have already said a million times, let me first highlight what I personally find to be the most striking aspect of the movie, namely the moral contradiction of these people.  On the one hand, they care for honor, they love their families, they respect traditions, they're nominally religious, they have a sense of responsibility as citizens, and they have a strong work ethic as businessmen (talk about high-stress jobs!).  But on the other hand, they resort to crime, terrorism, violence, and murder to attain money and power, thus being quite willing to disregard social norms and laws as they deem necessary.  I think many of us are fascinated by this juxtaposition because we all experience at least some degree of moral contradiction in our lives (after all, tough moral choices involving tradeoffs are routine), so a key contribution of these intense characters and circumstances is that they make explicit a tension we're all intuitively familiar with.Another theme which jumped out at me is that the mob is able to coerce even very wealthy and powerful people through violence or the threat of violence.  This is possible because they have an extensive and disciplined organizational structure which enables them to both circumvent law enforcement and apply force which no individual can resist (if you fight back against a mobster, you're fighting his entire mob family).Overall, this isn't a movie one simply recommends.  Rather, everyone needs to watch it at least once as part of their cultural education.  Also, this movie has much in common with ""The Sopranos"" series, so be sure to watch that series if you like this movie (in my opinion, it may be the best dramatic TV series ever made).",5,"Precursor to ""The Sopranos""",1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,2273,"['nearly', 'everyone', 'movie', 'mob', 'family', 'movie', 'wonderfully', 'crafted', 'aspect', 'found', 'gripping', 'start', 'finish', 'focus', 'clearly', 'men', 'family', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'hardly', 'developed', 'Superficially', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'tempted', 'say', 'just', 'story', 'particular', 'group', 'criminals', 'course', 'much', 'more', 'indeed', 'movie', 'iconic', 'classic', 'good', 'reasons.Rather', 'attempting', 'write', 'thorough', 'review', 'up', 'just', 'echoing', 'what', 'countless', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'million', 'times', 'let', 'first', 'highlight', 'what', 'personally', 'find', 'be', 'most', 'striking', 'aspect', 'movie', 'namely', 'moral', 'contradiction', 'people', 'one', 'hand', 'care', 'honor', 'love', 'families', 'respect', 'traditions', ""'re"", 'nominally', 'religious', 'have', 'sense', 'responsibility', 'citizens', 'have', 'strong', 'work', 'ethic', 'businessmen', 'talk', 'high-stress', 'jobs', 'other', 'hand', 'resort', 'crime', 'terrorism', 'violence', 'murder', 'attain', 'money', 'power', 'thus', 'being', 'quite', 'willing', 'disregard', 'social', 'norms', 'laws', 'deem', 'necessary', 'think', 'many', 'are', 'fascinated', 'juxtaposition', 'experience', 'least', 'degree', 'moral', 'contradiction', 'lives', 'tough', 'moral', 'choices', 'involving', 'tradeoffs', 'are', 'routine', 'so', 'key', 'contribution', 'intense', 'characters', 'circumstances', 'make', 'explicit', 'tension', ""'re"", 'intuitively', 'familiar', 'with.Another', 'theme', 'jumped', 'out', 'mob', 'able', 'coerce', 'even', 'very', 'wealthy', 'powerful', 'people', 'violence', 'threat', 'violence', 'possible', 'have', 'extensive', 'disciplined', 'organizational', 'structure', 'circumvent', 'law', 'enforcement', 'apply', 'force', 'individual', 'can', 'resist', 'fight', 'back', 'mobster', ""'re"", 'fighting', 'entire', 'mob', 'family', '.Overall', ""n't"", 'movie', 'one', 'simply', 'Rather', 'everyone', 'needs', 'watch', 'least', 'once', 'part', 'cultural', 'education', 'Also', 'movie', 'much', 'common', 'Sopranos', 'series', 'so', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'series', 'like', 'movie', 'opinion', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'dramatic', 'TV', 'series', 'ever', 'made']",The Godfather VHS

At this moment too the consumer's society has produced a new need in western societies, the need for some artificial paradise that could compensate the materialistic narrowmindedness of modern life, the lack of spirituality in mass comsumption. This paper tiger of a paradise is brought by drugs. The drug market explodes, and first of all in the USA. The maffia is confronted to this problem in New York and elsewhere. The older generation of the Godfather refuses this evolution and that brings some kind of confrontation among the five families or clans and the police of course that tries to put their hands on the profit without soiling their fingers. At the same time the Godfather is brought to realising that he has to let a younger generation take over. First an agreement is reached about drugs : drug trafficking will be accepted but regulated. No drugs to minors and in schools, and drugs in priority to the dark ones, the blacks in an attempt to keep this  cancer  contained in the most hated community in the US. This though is not enough to pacify the streets of New York. The Godfather's death is the signal for one of his surviving sons, appointed guardian of the business by the godfather himself, to take over. It is done in the most typical method of the maffia : the five families are decimated at their heads, including the Corleone family. The new Godfather eliminates his brother in law who is responsible for the death of one of the brothers. Brutal, ruthless, pacifying for sure for a while but the promise that with time vengeance will bring strife again. The depicting of power in a feudal system like that of the Sicilian maffia based on the signoria, on the absolute autonomy of each family and their right to defend their territories and their interests by any means including killing, including children and women.

Marlon Brando,  of course, won the Oscar for Best Actor.  All of the performances were  superb.  The only complaint I had was with Diane Keaton, who plays  Michael's wife.

490643,A2BSZPRBKYAB2K,B000003KHS,"Joe Owen ""Joe""","[13, 16]","Francis Ford Coppola directed an absolute masterpiece on film when he made the immortal classic &quot;The Godfather&quot;, which was adapted from Mario Puzo's best selling book about the inner working and ordeals of the Corleone Family who was head of the powerful Mafia organization. An excellent screenplay, excellent actors and excellent cinematography makes this one of the best films ever produced and its not hard to see why.The film stars Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone aka &quot;The Godfather&quot;, Al Pacino as The Godfather's son Michael, James Caan as Sonny who is The Godfather's eldest son and heir apparent, John Cazale as Fredo, the &quot;innocent&quot; son of Vito Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie the daughter and last but not least Robert Duvall as &quot;Tom Hagen&quot; as the adviser to the Don.  The rest of the supporting cast is outstanding as well.The screenplay is faithful to the storyline of the book, which excludes some chapters from the novel, however this doesn't diminish the movie in anyway.  It is a story, ultimately a tragic one, about the powerful Corleone Family and the internal strife, struggle, loyalty and love mixed in with a need for power ultimately makes victims of all members of the family.  I am sure all who have seen the movie know the plot well, and for those who havent seen the movie, I wont spoil any of it, since it is a movie &quot;you cant refuse&quot; to see.  The ultimate lesson of the movie in my opinion is &quot;Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely&quot;.The characters in the movie are supposedly based on real life Mafioso's such as real Gambino crime boss Sam &quot;Boom Boom&quot; Giancana is the inspiration for Vito Corleone and Johnny Fontaine is based on Frank Sinatra as it will be easy to see when the viewer watches the movie.This is a true classic in every sense of the word and I can't recommend it highly enough for those who enjoy classic movies and movies that last throughout time.  This is only the opening chapter however and there are two more movies (Godfather II and III) in this incredible saga that are just as brilliant as this one and I highly recommend that they be viewed as well to see the ultimate tragedy of the Corleone Family.",5,"Outstanding in every detail, a masterpiece of cinema",980035200,"01 21, 2001",2001,2225,"['Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'directed', 'absolute', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'when', 'made', 'immortal', 'classic', 'quot', 'Godfather', 'quot', 'was', 'adapted', 'Mario', 'Puzo', 'best', 'selling', 'book', 'inner', 'working', 'ordeals', 'Corleone', 'Family', 'who', 'was', 'head', 'powerful', 'Mafia', 'organization', 'excellent', 'screenplay', 'excellent', 'actors', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'produced', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Don', 'Vito', 'Corleone', 'aka', 'quot', 'Godfather', 'quot', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Godfather', 'son', 'Michael', 'James', 'Caan', 'Sonny', 'who', 'Godfather', 'eldest', 'son', 'heir', 'apparent', 'John', 'Cazale', 'Fredo', 'quot', 'innocent', 'quot', 'son', 'Vito', 'Corleone', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'Connie', 'daughter', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'quot', 'Tom', 'Hagen', 'quot', 'adviser', 'Don', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'well.The', 'screenplay', 'faithful', 'storyline', 'book', 'chapters', 'novel', 'however', ""n't"", 'diminish', 'movie', 'anyway', 'story', 'ultimately', 'tragic', 'one', 'powerful', 'Corleone', 'Family', 'internal', 'strife', 'struggle', 'loyalty', 'love', 'mixed', 'need', 'power', 'ultimately', 'victims', 'members', 'family', 'am', 'sure', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'know', 'plot', 'well', 'who', 'havent', 'seen', 'movie', 'wont', 'spoil', 'movie', 'quot', 'cant', 'refuse', 'quot', 'see', 'ultimate', 'lesson', 'movie', 'opinion', 'quot', 'Absolute', 'Power', 'Corrupts', 'Absolutely', 'quot', '.The', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'supposedly', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'Mafioso', 'such', 'real', 'Gambino', 'crime', 'boss', 'Sam', 'quot', 'Boom', 'Boom', 'quot', 'Giancana', 'inspiration', 'Vito', 'Corleone', 'Johnny', 'Fontaine', 'based', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'will', 'be', 'easy', 'see', 'when', 'viewer', 'movie.This', 'true', 'classic', 'sense', 'word', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'highly', 'enough', 'who', 'enjoy', 'classic', 'movies', 'movies', 'last', 'time', 'only', 'opening', 'chapter', 'however', 'are', 'two', 'more', 'movies', 'Godfather', 'II', 'III', 'incredible', 'saga', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'brilliant', 'one', 'highly', 'recommend', 'be', 'viewed', 'as', 'well', 'see', 'ultimate', 'tragedy', 'Corleone', 'Family']",The Godfather VHS

It is a shame that this great movie got such a poor Blu-ray conversion so this rating goes to the Blu-ray conversion only.I had the VHS set way back then, I still have the Godfather trilogy DVD set which called ""Godfather DVD Collection"" and it is excellent and very enjoyable. So I purchased the Blu-ray version of the Godfather and Godfather Part II and I am VERY DISAPPOINTED(Godfather Part III is an afterthought anyway and does not measure up to the first two).I agree with every negative remarks on this conversion, although the bad film grain only noticeable on a few short cuts and it does not bother me too much but I do not like the excessive contrast throughout the film where all the sunlit outside takes are just plain terrible. All the highlights are completely washed out so this disk for me is a piece of junk.

You will not believe how much the DVD version is better.

490657,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000003KHS,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[0, 1]","The mafia is a subject that has captivated the imaginations of both Hollywood and moviegoers alike for years and years. Generally, when the mob is chosen as the topic for another movie, assuming the film is done with the proper attention and care, it's pretty much a guarantee that there will be the potential for plenty of money flowing in at the box office. Many of the most successful mafia-themed movies rank amongst some of the best films Hollywood has ever offered to the public. With entries into this particular film grouping including some of Martin Scorcese's classics, such as ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"", to Sam Mendes' ""Road to Perdition"", and even on TV with HBO's ""The Sopranos"", it's no wonder this is a sub-genre that has lasted for so many decades; however, as great as all of those titles are, there is one trilogy of films that truly set the bar for what all others would be compared to. I'm referring to none other than the best of the best of the mafia film sub-genre...The Godfather trilogy. To kick things off lets talk about the one that started it all, the original classic film in director and co-writer Francis Ford Coppola's gangland magnum opus, ""The Godfather"".""The Godfather"" focuses on the fictional Corleone crime family. The family, as led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), vies for money and power amidst the dark world of organized crime. Set in the years following the Second World War, Don Vito Corleone is offered a chance for his family to further expand their empire via the fledgling, yet profitable drug trade. However, the Don is not convinced that this is the way their organization should take for more profits, a school of thought that the other rival families aren't too comfortable with. As tensions mount and battle lines are being drawn, Don Vito along with his sons, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo, and consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), prepare to do what must be done to preserve the power they have fought so long and hard to attain. As an all-out mafia war begins to claim casualties on all sides, it seems some new blood may be needed to turn the tide. Enter Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), the youngest of the Corleone children, and the one who had vowed to steer clear of the dark world that has consumed the rest of his family. However, certain events are unfolding that will force Michael to choose whether his destiny lies by his father's side or on his own path separate from a life of crime.Based upon the novel by Mario Puzo, who also served as co-writer alongside director Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather"" is one of the most faithful adaptations of a book that I have ever seen. Having read the book and seen the movie, I find both to be perfect companion pieces to one another. Even though it is cemented within the dark underworld of organized crime, the story is one that can resonate with virtually every person on some level, thanks in no small part to the many themes inherent within the screenplay and the novel.The biggest theme that this film deals with throughout its nearly three-hour running time is the concept of family, displayed in both a literal and metaphorical sense (as shown in the numerous references to a person's mafia affiliation and/or organization as a family). For me this was the most intriguing aspect of the film's richly layered story. Seeing how the various Corleone children grappled with the weight of eventually taking the reins of the family's various affairs, both personal and business related, was truly interesting and provided the strongest dramatic firepower for the script to draw from. For me, making the primary driving force of the screenplay focus upon the family aspect, made ""The Godfather"" stand apart from all other mafia themed movies that had come before it, and many that arrived after it, for that matter. Many times in these types of films we get a very violent story, full of intense drama and plenty of colorful language, and even some allusions to the themes found in this film, but it seems to be a bit of a rarity to find a mafia movie outside of this series that takes the time to delve deeply into the personal relationships these people establish over the course of their lives and nefarious careers as criminal figures. We all know that the mafia is all about loyalty, respect and living by certain codes of honor, but what we rarely get to see is where those attributes come from, which can only be found in the personal relationships these characters share with each other over the course of the film. To me, it is the personal touches found in this movie and its sequels that make the story all the more accessible, and elevate it from being just another mafia movie to something far greater.The casting choices made for ""The Godfather"" seem to perfectly embody every single character from Mario Puzo's classic novel, as if they could have walked right off of the page and onto the screen. Marlon Brando (""Superman: The Movie"") as the Corleone family's patriarch and Don of the Corleone crime family is simply iconic in his portrayal. He brings a warmth and magnetism to the character that instantly draws you in, essentially erasing all thoughts of the evil acts this man has committed either personally or via his organization. Yet behind the almost grandfatherly quality Brando gives the character, lies an extremely dangerous man, who possesses a quiet and powerful inner-strength, along with a worldly power that is unparalleled by any other member of the underworld.Portraying the other primary members of the story are veteran actors (although at the time they were still rising stars in Hollywood) James Caan (""Misery""), Robert Duvall (""Secondhand Lions""), and Al Pacino (""Heat""). James Caan plays the hot-headed eldest son of Vito Corleone named Sonny, who is first in line to take over the family business whenever the Don steps down or passes on. Caan perfectly portrays the character with a dangerous volatility that is electrifying and borderline insane at times, yet he also brings to the table an unyielding devotion to his family that is both his greatest strength and biggest weakness. Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen the surrogate son and consigliere to the Corleone family, seems an ideal choice lending the character plenty of gravitas, while at the same time giving a sense that he is constantly seeking approval from the other members of the family due to him being of German/Irish descent, and therefore an outsider to the otherwise Italian family. Lastly, we have Al Pacino, giving his most restrained performance of his career, long before he became the iconic actor he is today, as the youngest Corleone sibling and the one member of the family that tries his hardest to remain at a safe distance from the crime and corruption that has consumed the other family members. So, in a sense, even though Tom is an outsider due to his heritage, it is Michael who is the one that is truly the outsider, a position that he finds harder and harder to retain the more the story unfolds.Other cast members worthy of note would include Talia Shire (""Rocky""), Diane Keaton (""Because I Said So""), and John Cazale (""The Deer Hunter""). To be fair there are so many more actors and actresses that deserve attention, I just don't have the time to devote to them. Talia Shire played Connie Corleone, the lone girl amongst the Corleone children. Talia does a very good job with her character, even though she isn't given a very large amount of screen time. Nevertheless, if it weren't for her character's involvement many of the major events within the story never would have come to fruition. So, even though she possibly has the least amount of time in front of the camera, out of the entire family, her character's story arc is one of the most pivotal ones of all. The always terrific Diane Keaton is Kay Adams, the young woman who finds herself inadvertently dragged into this dark world through her romantic relationship with Michael. Diane gives Kay an innocence that balances the otherwise corrupt nature of essentially every other character within the film; however, it's fascinating to see her character's temptation by the power and money that accompanies such a dangerous world. To see how Kay grapples with the person she is and the person she may become via her romance is interesting, and provides some very small, yet important moments within the film. Rounding out this particular grouping we have Fredo Corleone played by rarely seen actor John Cazale (""The Deer Hunter""). Fredo is the middle child of the three Corleone boys, and is generally perceived as weak and relatively simple-minded in the grand scheme of things. Even though Fredo is given very little to do in this film, John is spot-on with his interpretation of the character, and it's a shame that an actor as talented as John clearly is, has for some reason chosen to shy away from movie roles ever since ""The Godfather Part II"".It seems somewhat strange to me that a film such as ""The Godfather"" has become such a globally recognizable film and essentially a major brand name for games, toys, etc. I feel this is strange partly because of these films' subject matter (which could be perceived as a reflection on our dwindling morality), but also because this film almost didn't see the light of day, at least not in the way we all have come to know and love. Prior to anyone really being attached to this film, the head of troubled film studio Paramount Pictures, Robert Evans, was having a difficult time convincing anyone to direct this gangland epic after acquiring the rights to the novel. It wasn't until director Francis Ford Coppola (""Dracula"") took the gig, in an effort to save his fledgling production company, that the film truly began to take shape. Even so, if it hadn't been for Francis' stubbornness, Italian heritage, and cinematic vision, who knows what this film would have ended up as, most likely it would not have been the masterpiece it wound up being, that is if the attempted studio tampering had prevailed. So, thank God for directors who know what they want, and have the courage to see their vision through.With a gripping story rife with powerful thematic elements, intense drama, and some of the best acting you will ever find in any film throughout history, ""The Godfather"" is a film that truly defines what it is to be a definitive tour de force of American cinema. If you have yet to see this film or its sequels, do yourself a gigantic favor and rent a copy today.""The Godfather"" is rated R for violence, brief language, and brief nudity.",5,"Power, Money,

490664,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B000003KHS,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[5, 7]","THE GODFATHER is universally considered one of the five greatest films ever made (amazingly, its twin, GODFATHER II shares that honor). As a Shakespearean tale of kingship, THE GODFATHER is less a gangster film than an archetypal prose opera about inner strength and moral decay.Marlon Brando plays Don Vito Corleone, the bulldog-faced, gravel-voiced ""Godfather"" of the title. In this Oscar-winning performance of a lifetime, Brando's Don Vito is a study in the sere Will to Power. Without raising his voice and with barely raising an eyebrow, he commands life, death and fortune. A man who knows who he is at all times, Don Vito judiciously employs respect and refined fear to rule over his world---violence is only a last resort when his Family is directly threatened.The external threat to his world is represented by Virgil Sollozzo (Al Lettieri), a heroin trafficker backed by a rival Family. Sollozzo's failed attempt to kill the Godfather plunges their world into a bloody war of vendetta and counter-vendetta.The internal threat is far more pressing: The Godfather has no heirs. The eldest son, Santino (James Caan) is a tornadically unstable and vengeful slaughterer; the second son, Fredo (John Cazale) is weak and dull-witted; the adopted son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duval) lacks the royal bloodline; the son-in-law, Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo) is an adulterous, wife-beating drunkard with no respect for Family; and the third son, Michael (Al Pacino) is prodigal, having turned his back on his father's universe.The Godfather's brush with death brings Michael back into the fold. The virtually unknown Pacino established himself as a commanding screen presence with this darkly quiet, intense and utterly honest portrayal of an unwilling child who inherits his father's mantle and ultimately makes it his own.Pacino, quite simply, was born to play this role. It is as hard not to imagine Al Pacino as Michael Corleone as it is to imagine the alternate choices, Robert Redford or Ryan O'Neal, playing the part. (Hollywood's ignorance of the rules of the inner world of the Sicilian Dons was reflected in the explanation that the blond Michael would have been 'northern Italian.')Pacino slowly and subtly transmogrifies from the innocent and prodigal son into the Godfather after his slaying of Sollozzo, his exile to Sicily, and the sudden death of his father, which unleashes a brief but terrible purge which consumes his enemies in their entirety.Despite his accession to the kingship, Michael never attains his father's sense of serenity-in-lordship, and immediately begins his decline, chronicled in THE GODFATHER II.Director Francis Ford Coppola draws on his innate understanding of Italian family and cultural life to create this brilliant, entertaining and hypnotic period piece, which is based on author Mario Puzo's novel and screenplay.

I also noted that virtually all of the reviews of the book agreed that the movie was better...I apparently disagree with the entire world.To be honest I felt this movie shamed Puzo's work.  Sub-plots either dissapear completely (as with Santino's girlfriend and the doctor), or are incomplete (as with Johnny, and the daughter).  Lines which once held significance are reduced to nothing, not even an explanation of their original significance (in the book all the other Dons laughed at the idea of heroine being sold to kids, and the Don's speech about what he'd do if anything happened to Micheal was much longer).  I give it 2 stars because most of the actors do their jobs competently, although not extrodinarily.  But by some freak accident of nature the one actor who was truly ill-equiped for his role recieved an Oscar for it.  That's right Mr. Brando, I'm talking to you.

Marlon Brando's performance in this movie is the finest work he ever did, and may be the finest work any actor ever did.  He doesn't stand alone.  The rest of the cast is tremendous as well.There is one obvious fault in the movie.  It idealizes the Mafia.  With such a glorious example of a mafia don as Vito Corleone, we are given the impression that the Mafia is made up of brilliant and sensitive heroes, at least in this one character.From the first scene, Connie's wedding, where the don grants justice to Bona Sera for his daughter's vicious assault, the Marlon Brando character stands about as tall as Lincoln.  I really wouldn't expect to find a man that amazing.  I'd expect to find greedy selfish violent men running the Mafia, not wonderful men like Corleone.That's my only criticism.  The story is beautifully crafted.Oh wait, one more criticism.  I think that Michael should have leveled with Kay at the end.  He had ample reason for his decision, and she would have understood and, if not approved, at least considered staying with him through the years.

I watched to find out why people think it's one of the greatest films ever.  Even Kubrick, whose films I love, thought so.  I expected to be offended by a celebration of mafia violence and the underworld, but I was wrong.  It was serious, boring, and utterly pretentious.Yes, the actors are good, but who can take this story seriously?  One commenter discusses the great drama of Michael Corleone's transformation from the 'good son' to the head of the family.  From where I sat, it seemed to happen instantaneously and without conflict.  Also puzzling was why his New England girlfriend, Kay, is so faithful to him through his desertion, despite being troubled by his activities.  Just WHO is she??  Then there's the Irish Tom Higgins - we are supposed to just accept that a non-Sicilian, non-ITALIAN is the chief advisor to a Don who puts family and community above all.  How multi-cultural!  Of course, we don't get a clue about what his odd position might mean to Tom.  He's a one-dimensional character like Kay.I found the idyll during Michael's exile in Sicily laughable.  (Was the mistaken car-bombing of his wife a allusion to The Big Heat, in which Marlon Brando's sister plays a character who meets the same fate?)

He's standing in church with the baby and the priest is chanting religious words about such things as resisting the power of Satan.  While this is going on the scene changes back and forth to the murders that are taking place at that very moment due to Al Pacino's orders.The authenticity of detail was outstanding, giving specificity to the setting and to the individuals.  Each character was unique and interesting. And the dialogue had enough of an edge to feel real.  No wasted words, no wasted action.  This video definitely enhanced my experience of the book.

490680,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B000003KHS,magellan,"[4, 6]","You might think a debate about which was the better movie, The Godfather, or Star Wars, might be a little strange, but I was discussing it with a friend tonight, and came up with some perhaps off the wall comments, so I thought I'd post them here. Interestingly, one can find Star Wars on some movie website's top 100 films, although usually, such as on the AFI (American Film Institute) website, if there's a great sci-film in the top 100, it's usually 2001.Although many people might not put the original Star Wars movies up there with the Godfather as films, they were, although perhaps not great flicks in the sense that they had great acting, a great plot, a great script and dialog and other traditional film values, still, they were a lot of fun and the special effects were terrific. If I want great acting, plots, and writing I can always rent Citizen Kane, Bad Day at Black Rock, Mutiny on the Bounty, The Shawshank Redemption, The Godfather, etc.Most film historians would probably say 2001 is a greater sci-fi film, but it's a very different movie from Star Wars in that it's almost as much a mood piece as a sci-fi flick, and really gets by on the superb direction and vision of Kubrick, not because the plot or script or acting is that great. In fact, unless you read the original book, the ending is completely nonsensical (it's nonsensical anyway although I like Clarke).And as for the Godfather movies, it seems to me that all you had to do to make an impression in this movie was have an appropriately Mafioso-esque mug and demeanor (meaning that you look like you're going to kill the next guy who cuts ahead of you in line all the time) and go around with a beetled brow and a sedulous but crazed look in your eyes, occasionally shooting people in restaurants or in bars and such, and apparently that counts for great acting and atmosphere. No doubt there was some great acting in the movie by the admittedly notable cast, but sometimes the movie's reputation seemed to be as much the result of the shock effect of some of the more grisly violence scenes (such as the horse's head one) as anything else.Well, clearly I'm being a little facetious here, as The Godfather is a great flick on many levels (and I admit to not necessarily having the most sophisticated taste when it comes to movies, either :-)). It often appears in the top 5 movies on movie websites of the top 100 movies, and sometimes it's number 2, after Citizen Kane. So there is no doubt that there is a consensus about it being a truly great movie. But also the question is a legitimate one, which is how one really objectively evaluates the aesthetic and dramatic qualities of films that are so different in one sense, and yet so much alike in another (all films basically simply being more visually dramatic presentations of your typical story or novel). I don't pretend to know the answer to this question myself, except to say that what makes both novels and films different is easy to say, because of the problems in translating the book into a film, but what makes them truly great enough to stand out from the herd isn't always that easy to distinguish or to articulate.",5,A perhaps strange comparison,1114819200,"04 30, 2005",2005,3165,"['might', 'think', 'debate', 'was', 'better', 'movie', 'Godfather', 'Star', 'Wars', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'strange', 'was', 'discussing', 'friend', 'tonight', 'came', 'up', 'perhaps', 'wall', 'comments', 'thought', ""'d"", 'post', 'here', 'Interestingly', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movie', 'website', 'top', '100', 'films', 'usually', 'such', 'AFI', 'American', 'Film', 'Institute', 'website', 'great', 'sci-film', 'top', '100', 'usually', '2001.Although', 'many', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'put', 'original', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movies', 'there', 'Godfather', 'films', 'were', 'perhaps', 'not', 'great', 'flicks', 'sense', 'had', 'great', 'acting', 'great', 'plot', 'great', 'script', 'dialog', 'other', 'traditional', 'film', 'values', 'still', 'were', 'lot', 'fun', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'terrific', 'want', 'great', 'acting', 'plots', 'writing', 'can', 'always', 'rent', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Bad', 'Day', 'Black', 'Rock', 'Mutiny', 'Bounty', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Godfather', 'etc.Most', 'film', 'historians', 'would', 'probably', 'say', '2001', 'greater', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'very', 'different', 'movie', 'Star', 'Wars', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'mood', 'piece', 'sci-fi', 'flick', 'really', 'superb', 'direction', 'vision', 'Kubrick', 'not', 'plot', 'script', 'acting', 'great', 'fact', 'read', 'original', 'book', 'ending', 'completely', 'nonsensical', 'nonsensical', 'anyway', 'like', 'Clarke', '.And', 'Godfather', 'movies', 'had', 'do', 'make', 'impression', 'movie', 'was', 'have', 'appropriately', 'Mafioso-esque', 'mug', 'demeanor', 'meaning', 'look', ""'re"", 'going', 'kill', 'next', 'guy', 'who', 'ahead', 'line', 'time', 'go', 'around', 'beetled', 'brow', 'sedulous', 'crazed', 'look', 'eyes', 'occasionally', 'shooting', 'people', 'restaurants', 'bars', 'such', 'apparently', 'counts', 'great', 'acting', 'atmosphere', 'doubt', 'was', 'great', 'acting', 'movie', 'admittedly', 'notable', 'cast', 'sometimes', 'movie', 'reputation', 'seemed', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'result', 'shock', 'effect', 'more', 'grisly', 'violence', 'scenes', 'such', 'horse', 'head', 'one', 'anything', 'else.Well', 'clearly', ""'m"", 'being', 'little', 'facetious', 'here', 'Godfather', 'great', 'flick', 'many', 'levels', 'admit', 'not', 'necessarily', 'having', 'most', 'sophisticated', 'taste', 'when', 'movies', 'often', 'top', '5', 'movies', 'movie', 'websites', 'top', '100', 'movies', 'number', '2', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'So', 'doubt', 'consensus', 'being', 'truly', 'great', 'movie', 'also', 'question', 'legitimate', 'one', 'how', 'one', 'really', 'objectively', 'aesthetic', 'dramatic', 'qualities', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'one', 'sense', 'yet', 'so', 'much', 'alike', 'films', 'basically', 'simply', 'being', 'more', 'visually', 'dramatic', 'presentations', 'typical', 'story', 'novel', 'do', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'know', 'answer', 'question', 'say', 'what', 'novels', 'films', 'different', 'easy', 'say', 'problems', 'translating', 'book', 'film', 'what', 'truly', 'great', 'enough', 'stand', 'out', 'herd', ""n't"", 'always', 'easy', 'distinguish', 'articulate']",The Godfather VHS

490687,A36EW68H08UOCS,B000003KHS,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[3, 6]","I think it is fair to say that ""The Godfather"" is among the most acclaimed films of all time.  This movie is huge - an icon - and many since have imitated it's style.  For decades I don't know how many movies have been hyped as ""The Chinese Godfather"" or ""The Modern Godfather"".  They all fall short of the original.It's interesting to me that much second-guessing surrounded everything from the story to the casting of actors such as Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.  Those two are joined by Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda and Talia Shire and I see I'm using up space giving you the all-star cast.The story, the direction, the lighting and the cinematography were all revolutionary.  It was controversial to make a movie in which the ""heroes"" were gangsters, but here Francis Ford Coppola and writer Mario Puzo mesmerized us with the story of men who were at times ruthless killers, yet at the same time devoted to their families and devout to their church.  The backstory of how Vito Corleone became ""The Godfather"" from Puzo's original novel isn't told until the 2nd movie (with Robert DeNiro playing the young Vito), but we see that these Mafia men believe that they are in a country full of opportunity, but also full of corruption - they know that if they don't exploit the world someone else will - so this justfies their careers in their minds.The movie is a series of virtuoso sequences and performances.  Small nuances are performed with fluorishes - Brando affectionately petting the purring kitten in the opening sequence while men are lining up to come into his office to pay their respects or ask favors of him - because it's his daughter's wedding day he cannot refuse.The wedding introduces the broad cast of characters and we get time to see that Santino is the hot-headed lover, Fredo is the dim-witted brother and Michael is the returning war-hero who distances himself from the ""family business"".  Although there are literally hundreds of individual sub-plots, the main story of the entire Godfather Trilogy is Michael's, (after his father) and how he goes from youngest son, determined to stay out of the business, to a Godfather more ruthless than them all.After the wedding is another virtuoso scene that sets up most of the rest of the movie.  Al Lettieri as Sollozzo requests a meeting with the Corleone family.  He wants to establish a drug empire and he has already made arrangements for getting the opium and distributing it.  From the Corleones he needs ""a little finance"" and political protection for when his men are inevitably stopped by police.  Vito Corleone has made his fortune first hijacking delivery trucks, then in gambling and bootlegging, which he tells Sollozzo the police regard as ""harmless vices"".  He is disdainful of a rival Don who deals in prostitution. At one point he tells his son ""Tattaglia is a pimp"" with complete disgust.  He tells Sollozzo that he must refuse the offer because his political friends will no longer be his friends if he begins to deal in drugs.  Sollozzo replies that the Tattaglia family guarantee the investment, and that the riches are projected to come pouring in.  Hot-headed Sonny speaks out of turn and abruptly interjects ""you mean the Tattaglia's GUARANTEE our investment"".  His father has already decided for his entire organization, and Santino, the 2nd in charge, reveals his eagerness to Sollozzo for trying this drug plan.  No word is spoken after Vito shuts up his son with a gesture, but knowing looks are passed between everyone in the room.  There will be trouble because Sollozzo now knows that Sonny is hot for the deal.Sollozzo arranges to hit Don Corleone and his most trusted bodyguard, the fearful Luca Brasi.  What he doesn't plan on is that Sonny's loyalty to his family, and his famous rage, are going to take precedent over any desire to join Sollozzo in the drug business.I have only encapsulated the first act of one of America's greatest film epics.  Although they are gangsters, these characters stick with you.

490691,A3ENN25NFADE1X,B000003KHS,MBrian,"[3, 4]","""One of the Best Films of the Decade.""The ""Godfather"" is Frances Ford Coppola's best film. Marlon Brando gives the most memorable performance in film history as Vito Corleone. The Movie is based on the gripping and compulsive book, The Godfather. Al Pacino gives a legendary performances as Michael Corleone.The beginning is set late in the summer of 1945. The films roots, however, are set in the gangster films of the early thirties. The plot is about rival gangs murdering each other, and now we see the inbred corrupt system of loyalty and terror, in which killing is a preferred way of dealing with the competition. We see how the gangs encroach on each other and why this form of illegal business inevitably erupts in violence. We see their subculture, based on a split between the men's conception of their responsibilities, which they keep dark form there families, and the false world the create to shelter the women and children.The visual scheme is based on the most obvious life and death contrasts, the men meet and conduct their business in deep toned, shuttered rooms, lighted by lamps even in the daytime, and the story moves back and forth between this hidden, world and the sunshine that they share with the woman and children. The tension is in the meetings held in the underworld darkness and one gets the feeling that this secret life has its own poetry of fear. The dark and light contrast is so operatic and so openly symbolic that it perfectly expresses the basic nature of the material. Noting the Catholic background of the characters and the eternal battle of good and evil, of innocence versus knowledge, knowledge in this instance equates with shame nd guilt.BRANDOThe enormous cast is lead by Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, the ""Godfather"" of a powerful Sicilian - American clan, with James Caan as his hothead son, sonny, and Al Pacino as the thoughtful, educated son, Micheal. Is Brando marvelous? Yes, he is, but then he often is, he was marvelous a few years ago in ""On The Waterfront."" He's shockingly effective in a current film, the ""Score."" The role of Don Corleone, a patriarch in his early sixties, allows him to release more of the gentleness that was so seductive and unsettling. Don Vito could be played as a magnificent old warrior, a noble killer, a handsome bull, but Brando manages to humanize him. Brando internalizes Don Vito's power, makes him less physically threatening and deeper, hidden within himself.THE CASTHowever, Brando isn't the whole show; James Caan is very fine actor , and so are Robert Duvall and many others in lesser roles. Don sons suggest different aspects of Brando, Caan's Sonny looks like the muscular young Brando, while his heir, Michael, and Al Pacino comes to resemble him in manner and voice. Like Brando in this film, Pacino is simple, you don't catch him acting, yet he manages to change from a small, fresh-faced, darkly handsome college boy into an underworld lord, becoming more intense, smaller, and more isolated at every step. Coppola doesn't stess the father and son links, they are simply there for us to notice when we will. In the end of the ""Godfather"" nothing is resolved, because the family business goes on. Terry Malloy didn't clean up the docks at the end of ""On The Waterfront"", that was a lie. The ""Godfather"" is popular melodrama, but it expresses a new tragic realism.",5,One of the Best Films of our Time,1093737600,"08 29, 2004",2004,3373,"['One', 'Best', 'Films', 'Decade', 'Godfather', 'Frances', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'best', 'film', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'most', 'memorable', 'performance', 'film', 'history', 'Vito', 'Corleone', 'Movie', 'based', 'gripping', 'compulsive', 'book', 'Godfather', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'legendary', 'performances', 'Michael', 'Corleone.The', 'beginning', 'set', 'late', 'summer', '1945', 'films', 'roots', 'however', 'are', 'set', 'gangster', 'films', 'early', 'thirties', 'plot', 'rival', 'gangs', 'murdering', 'other', 'now', 'see', 'inbred', 'corrupt', 'system', 'loyalty', 'terror', 'killing', 'preferred', 'way', 'dealing', 'competition', 'see', 'how', 'gangs', 'encroach', 'other', 'why', 'form', 'illegal', 'business', 'inevitably', 'violence', 'see', 'subculture', 'based', 'split', 'men', 'conception', 'responsibilities', 'keep', 'dark', 'form', 'families', 'false', 'world', 'create', 'shelter', 'women', 'children.The', 'visual', 'scheme', 'based', 'most', 'obvious', 'life', 'death', 'contrasts', 'men', 'meet', 'conduct', 'business', 'deep', 'toned', 'shuttered', 'rooms', 'lighted', 'lamps', 'even', 'daytime', 'story', 'back', 'forth', 'hidden', 'world', 'sunshine', 'share', 'woman', 'children', 'tension', 'meetings', 'held', 'underworld', 'darkness', 'one', 'feeling', 'secret', 'life', 'own', 'poetry', 'fear', 'dark', 'light', 'contrast', 'so', 'operatic', 'so', 'openly', 'symbolic', 'perfectly', 'basic', 'nature', 'material', 'Noting', 'Catholic', 'background', 'characters', 'eternal', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'innocence', 'versus', 'knowledge', 'knowledge', 'instance', 'shame', 'guilt.BRANDOThe', 'enormous', 'cast', 'lead', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Don', 'Vito', 'Corleone', 'Godfather', 'powerful', 'Sicilian', 'American', 'clan', 'James', 'Caan', 'hothead', 'son', 'sonny', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'thoughtful', 'educated', 'son', 'Micheal', 'Brando', 'marvelous', 'Yes', 'then', 'often', 'was', 'marvelous', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Waterfront', 'shockingly', 'effective', 'current', 'film', 'Score', 'role', 'Don', 'Corleone', 'patriarch', 'early', 'sixties', 'release', 'more', 'gentleness', 'was', 'so', 'seductive', 'unsettling', 'Don', 'Vito', 'could', 'be', 'played', 'magnificent', 'old', 'warrior', 'noble', 'killer', 'handsome', 'bull', 'Brando', 'humanize', 'Brando', 'Don', 'Vito', 'power', 'less', 'physically', 'threatening', 'deeper', 'hidden', 'himself.THE', 'CASTHowever', 'Brando', ""n't"", 'whole', 'show', 'James', 'Caan', 'very', 'fine', 'actor', 'so', 'are', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'many', 'others', 'lesser', 'roles', 'Don', 'sons', 'suggest', 'different', 'aspects', 'Brando', 'Caan', 'Sonny', 'muscular', 'young', 'Brando', 'heir', 'Michael', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'resemble', 'manner', 'voice', 'Brando', 'film', 'Pacino', 'simple', 'do', ""n't"", 'catch', 'acting', 'yet', 'change', 'small', 'fresh-faced', 'darkly', 'handsome', 'college', 'boy', 'underworld', 'lord', 'becoming', 'more', 'intense', 'smaller', 'more', 'isolated', 'step', 'Coppola', ""n't"", 'stess', 'father', 'son', 'links', 'are', 'simply', 'there', 'notice', 'when', 'will', 'end', 'Godfather', 'nothing', 'resolved', 'family', 'business', 'Terry', 'Malloy', 'did', ""n't"", 'clean', 'up', 'docks', 'end', 'Waterfront', 'was', 'lie', 'Godfather', 'popular', 'melodrama', 'new', 'tragic', 'realism']",The Godfather VHS

490693,AGQY11NLQJ2JL,B000003KHS,Medusa,"[2, 6]","I read the Godfather book by Mario Puzo when I was 13 years old. I think the mastery of telling this story is what started my love to reading. Till now, I still vividly remember most of the details. My passion with this story didn't relate to how good or how bad the characters were, but to how related the delivery of a story to liking or disliking the plot. I hesitated before seeing the movie, as I didn't want to ruin that image I had of the book all these years. The movie, the direction, the music, and the cast were to my surprise a great complement to a great book.Warning: By describing some details of a well known movie, I hope I'm not spoiling the ending for some People, but as it's a well known story, you can choose to stop reading now:From the opening scene with Don(Vito) Corleone (Marlon Brando) dispensing favors to supplicants on the day of his daughter's wedding (The Godfather we are told cannot refuse a favor on his daughter's wedding day)  to the closing scene with, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) being greeted as the new Don Corleone, the Godfather is a film of remarkable insight, passion, intensity and breadth set against the backdrop of normal family life.  The traditional Italian wedding celebration in all its joy and happiness goes on outside while Don Corleone (The Godfather) carries on the business of organized crime inside the family house.As Don Corleone receives and talks with those who have come to him seeking favors, we learn something about his character, about his sense of justice and his all important connection to his family.  The undertaker, who is petitioning The Godfather to do something to the two men who attacked his daughter and were basically let go by the police.  The Don asks him ""Why did you go to the police first?""  The petitioner gives some feeble reply then adds that a friend told him after he went to the police: ""If you want justice go to Don Corleone.""  We see a look of pride in the Godfather's face at the recognition that he is the one who looks after his people.  We are presented with the fact that there is indeed a difference between the law(police) and justice (The Godfather) and clearly justice is more important and reliable than the law.  Amidst this talk of violence and retribution, we also hear the Godfather ask one of those in the room: ""Do you spend time with your family? Because a man can only be a man if he spends time with his family""As the wedding celebration winds on Don Corleone keeps asking where his son Michael is even though his other for children (Connie, Sonny, Fredo and Tom Hagan the adopted street urchin who is now the family Consigliere) are all present at the wedding.  Perhaps some foreshadowing of the special connection that exists between Vito and his son Michael.  Michael finally arrives at the wedding with his obviously non-Sicilian girlfriend, but yet he remains sort of detached from the whole celebration as he sits with his girlfriend talking about his family and yet at the same time distancing himself from criminal aspects of the family.  Likewise we begin to understand the nature of the other siblings Sonny, the impetuous passionate son, whose brain seems to reside somewhere below his waist and rises and falls accordingly, Fredo the fun loving, insecure brother, Connie the congenial, passionate sister and Tom Hagan the measured advisor of whom it is said ""He is a good lawyer, but he is not Sicilian""As the film unfolds we are treated to display of some of the Godfather's techniques of persuasion when he is refused a favor by a Hollywood producer.  Tom Hagan, who as Consigliere is sent to reason with the producer says by way of warning: ""The Godfather never asks for a second favor when the first favor is refused.""Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo, a minor crime figure comes to see the Godfather to seek his financial support and protection to allow him to expand his small but growing illegal drug business.  Don Corleone sees no harm in gambling, prostitution or money laundering, but he finds the idea of the drug trade reprehensible, in spite of the potential profits to be made, so he refuse the request of Sollozzo.  This refusal triggers a small war between the Tattaglia and Corleone families. An attempt is made on Vito Corleone's life as he is shopping for fruit at the local fruit vendor (how normal)As Don Corleone lies gravely wounded in the hospital, Michael goes to visit his father. As Michael enters the hospital he notices that the men sent to guard his father are gone.  He senses that something is up and acts very quickly to move his father to another room to protect him from the assassins, who are on their way to finish the job.  This is the beginning of Michael's transition from reluctant participant in the family business to eventual successor.  His ability to quickly recognize the danger to his father and act in a decisive way to protect him shows that he has the perception and the ability to lead.During his ordeal at the hospital Michael is assaulted by a police captain, who is in the pay of Sollozzo and who had removed the men guarding his father.  As Michael, Tom and Sonny talk about the assault later, you sense their desire to revenge the insult, but taking revenge against a police officer it is said will release such a torrent of problems that it should be avoided.  Michael very calmly and matter-of-factly says he will kill both Sollozzo and the Police captain to avenge his father and himself.  More and more Michael is drawn into that which neither he nor his father wanted.  As promised Michael gets his revenge against Sollozzo, after which he is exiled to Corleone on Sicily under the protection of Don Tomasino, until the heat dies down.While in Sicily Michael meets and marries a lovely, spirited local girl, who is later killed as part of an attempt on Michael's life.  Eventually, Michael arrives back in America, his brother Sonny dead, his father old and ready to hand the reigns of power to Michael.Michael is reunited with and marries Kay his original girlfriend and with each passing day becomes more involved with the criminal activities of the family.  More and more he is taking charge and emerging as the future leader of the family.  From his foray into the casino business in Las Vegas, to his penchant for vengeance, we see that Michael has the right stuff to be the next Don Corleone.With the death of Vito Corleone, Michael's father, the shadow of another generation of the Corleone family lost to the cycle of crime and violence looms ever larger.  We hear Michael greeted as Don Corleone and an unnerving shiver travels up our spine.I have illuminated only a portion of this marvelous captivating movie, but to capture the full impact and beauty of this masterpiece you must experience it for yourself.",5,"The Godfather (Ecellente, Notevole, Fantastico)",1232755200,"01 24, 2009",2009,6804,"['read', 'Godfather', 'book', 'Mario', 'Puzo', 'when',

The role of the family head is well played by Marlon Brando. The roles of the two sons are played very effectively by Al Pacino and James Caan. This movies chronicles some of the events that take place in the world of the Mafia. The attempt on Don Corleone and the revenge by Michael his youngest son. Especially interesting was the method employed by Don Corleone to convince the Hollywood producer to give the leading role in a war movie to his godson. One will never forget the horse's head in the bed. The death of Don Corleone and the assension to power by the youngest son Michael is also shown. The movie ends with a bang with the Corleone family killing the heads of the rival families and gaing vengance for the murder of the Corleone son Sonny.Also to be noted is the outstanding scenery and the way that it is used to reflect the time in history that the events are taking place.

490702,A27PSZX2SE0B51,B000003KHS,Mike Stone,"[11, 15]","Generally regarded as one of the finest movies ever made, ""The Godfather"" would seem to be review-proof.  By this point, some 30 years after its initial release, what else could be said of it?  Critically it's adored.  And those who loathe it are bound to loathe it no matter what I, or anyone else really, has to say.So instead of doing a standard review, I thought I'd pick out key elements from the movie, elements that struck me as important after my fourth and most recent viewing, but that I haven't seen analyzed to death over the years.  This effort will, I hope, shed some new light on the film, going beyond the usual iconic moments (the horse in the bed; the cat on the lap; Sonny at the tollbooth) and memorable dialogue (""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse""; ""Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes""; ""Leave the gun... take the cannoli"") to give you something personally relevant.  And if doesn't, then at least it gave me the opportunity to write about ""The Godfather"" for awhile.""I believe in America.""  These are the film's opening lines.  Spoken not by Marlon Brandon, Al Pacino, James Caan or even, say, Abe Vigoda, but by Salvatore Corsitto as Bonasera the Undertaker.  It begins a long speech about how his daughter was beaten to near death, and as Corsitto tells the tale, the camera slowly zooms out to reveal the darkened office, and then the silhouetted visage of Brando.  It begins a curious game of cat and mouse, for it takes a long time for the film to truly reveal whom this story is about.  Now, unless you've been living under a rock for the last thirty years, or, more appropriately, been locked in the trunk of a Cadillac, you know whose story is about to be told.  But let's wipe away hindsight, and assume you are an audience member in a darkened theatre in 1972, one who hasn't read Mario Puzo's soon-to-be-blockbuster book, who'd forgotten the power of Marlon Brando (it had been almost 20 years since ""On the Waterfront""), and had never heard of Al Pacino.The first scene makes it clear that Vito Corleone is a powerful presence.  Is this his story?  It would seem so, as his family is gathered together for the luxurious wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire).  But then Vito's consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is introduced, a lawyer who was once taken in by Vito while just an orphan child.  Maybe it is the story of these two men, the Sicilian-born Don and his German-Irish adopted son.  This idea is nearly cemented when Tom goes to Hollywood, ostensibly to get Johnny Fontaine (Al Martino) out of a binding contract with Jack Woltz (John Marley), but more likely just as an excuse to put a horse's head in a bed.  Back in New York, we are introduced to Sonny (Caan), Vito's eldest boy, a hotheaded gorilla more proficient at quenching his animal lusts than at running a crime family.  Is it Sonny's story?  Could be, could be.  See what I mean?  It's like a great game of chess: director Francis Ford Coppola deploys his pawns, his rooks, his knights, and his bishops, before ever moving his Queen.  But when she finally emerges from her sanctuary, the board is wiped clean with a few bold moves.Michael (Pacino), in these early expository scenes, only acts as a Greek chorus.  A war hero and a college boy, he explains to his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) who his father is, and why he should be feared.  And he tries to tell her that that is not him.  But then comes the scene at the hospital.  Vito has been shot, but not killed, and Michael goes to visit him.  Surprised to find no security by his father's room, and aware that this means men are on their way to finish the job, Michael, along with a nurse, decides to move his father to another room.  After a near-farcical scene of hide-and-seek in the hospital halls, Michael, in an attempt to reassure his frightened father, whispers the following lines into the old man's ear: ""I'm with you now.  I'm with you.""  The double meaning of these words is made quite apparent by Vito's smile and Michael's angst-filled expression.  Just when he thought he was out of the family business, circumstances pull him back in.  Michael's inevitable coronation, and the film's operatic aftermath, is now inevitable.About 110 minutes into the movie, Sonny finds out that Connie's husband Carlo (Gianni Russo) has been slapping her around.  Ever the vigilant brother, Sonny storms out to teach Carlo a lesson.  He finds him on the steps of a brownstone selling drugs, and before Carlo knows what's happening, Sonny is wailing on him mercilessly with punch after punch of staggering power.  Er, all except the fourth one, that is.  Maybe the filmmakers only had time for one take, or maybe a sloppy editor missed it, but the fourth punch misses Carlo by a good 2 feet.  Now, I'm a big believer in the adage, ""The exception proves the rule.""  And this moment is the film's one blemish, standing out like the Glad garbage man at a Goth convention.  But sandwiched between the film's first and second half, it manages to prove the perfection achieved by each.I first saw ""The Godfather"" after reading the book as a teenager.  Not the best way to view any film, and nearly fatal here.  I expected to find a lot of the book's rich backstory but didn't.  My first viewing was a disappointment.  Every subsequent viewing, however, has made me fall more in love with this film than I ever thought possible.  And now you know why I chose this alternate method of reviewing: I knew that the hyperbole would flow fast and furious once I begin typing.  Despite my best intentions, I couldn't avoid it.  That is, ultimately, the power of ""The Godfather"".",5,"One More Orange For The Pile: My Take On ""The Godfather""",1029283200,"08 14, 2002",2002,5645,"['Generally', 'regarded', 'one', 'finest',

I was shocked when the movie started to play. For all the hoopla over the 'meticulous restoration,' the movie is NOT presented in it's original aspect ratio!  In other words the movie is not as widescreen as originally presented.Something seemed wrong early on, but it wasn't until some of the real wide shots - including the massacre of Sonny Corleone.  In the theatrical release and earlier DVD releases, these panaramas were breathtaking.  In this version they looked like a version you'd see on AMC.What is even more offensive is that the movie included in 'The Collection' IS presented in the original aspect ratio!  Why would one blu-ray version be so botched in the individual disc than in a box set.  I'm amazed.  Shame on me for not reading the specs closely on all the discs before I bought the disc.Having said that, the picture quality IS amazing and I was really happy with the overall restoration.  I just don't understand why Coppola would approve this altered version of his masterpiece on a Blu-ray release!I may seem a little anal about this, but I buy DVDs and Blu-rays so that I have the closest possible version to the original.

My parents, friends, and English teacher, for we studied this film in class, all thought so.  However, I beg to differ.This film may have been new for it's time and left some kind of mark; however, I just can't see this film having any kind of permanence at all.First of all, the cinematography isn't that impressive.  For instance, there are only about three camera shots, three, that stand out as nice, but for the rest of the movie everything is just bland (camera stuff that is).  Lighting?  Well, it's dark.  That's it, just dark.  How complicated is that, making a film dark?  Now film technicalities out of the way, let's talk about story.This movie is not an American success story, as some people would like you to think.  Think of it this way.  When an ethnic group creates an underground crime organization we laud it in films and books, but when real gangs break out they are feared on Channel 5 news.  Double standard, right?  So, as the supposedly sweet Godfather goes off killing or threatening people remember he's doing just that, and I even liked Marlon Brando's part (the Godfather!)Once the film becomes Michael's story, one of the Godfather's sons (played by Pacino), that's when I really phase out.  This is a story, and the sequel too, about Michael's conflict.  However, I think that Coppola actually believes that we are supposed to feel for this cold-hearted person, who was supposed to be the good son.If you want to watch a film that is drawn out, boring, and shows why ""business"" is all it is then go ahead.  Also, I feel you should watch it just because everyone else thinks it is so ""important""; maybe you'll agree.

It is in fact the best movie ever made and at at the very least the best mob movie ever made(Followed closely by The Godfather part 2). Instead of bludgeoning us with shoot outs and bloody deaths, Coppola weaves a character study about a family. Being Italian American myself, I can tell you this is the most accurate portrayal of an Italian American family I have ever seen on screen! Of course there is violence and when it comes it comes on strong, but the heart of this film is in the performances of every person in this film!First rate performances throughout and every attention to detail is impeccable. One of the most amazing performances is Marlon Brando's Don. He isn't on screen very long, but leaves us with one of the most unforgettable and powerful characters in the history of film. The films runs almost three hours, but when it ends you will be craving more. It's just a fascinating film and I can not think of any other film that I have watched more in my life.

490721,A2ZTB8EDDR8RGW,B000003KHS,Penguin Egg,"[2, 2]","At just under four hours, this is a long film, but one that holds the viewer riveted. Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, comes back from World War II as a hero. His family are leading mobsters and it is a life he wants to reject, but his hand is forced when his father, Don Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, is shot down in the street. Slowly and reluctantly, he gets sucked into the vortex of the Mob, proving himself every bit as ruthless as his rivals.This film reveals perfectly the analogy between 20th Century gangsters and the aristocracy. Not the effete aristocracy of the modern age but that of antiquity: when brutality and nobility went together; when power came from brute strength. This is what Thomas Paine had to say about the aristocracy:""It could have been no difficult thing....for a banditti of ruffians to overrun a country [and] their power being thus established, the chief of the band contrived to lose the name of Robber in that of monarch and hence the origin of Monarchy and Kings.""  `The Rights of Man.'If Don Corleone had been born in the pre-democratic age, his descendants would now have lands and respectable titles. Don Corleone insists people call him Godfather: In a previous age it would have been King, Duke, Baron, or Prince. It all means the same. Splendour sits side by side with violence. There are no ethics, only power. Everything else is a faade.This was made in the 70s, when Coppola made genuinely great films. It's a compelling story beautifully told. The pacing is steady but never slow. The performances are flawless: the cinematography beautiful. Come the 80s, his genius would desert him. However, his classic films are still around and show just how powerful a medium film can be. The Godfather is ample evidence of this.

Coppola's version of Mario Puzo's historical novel about a New York gangster family's rise and fall is a landmark, and it has become so famous it probably needs no introduction or description. If you haven't seen this one, you're woefully lacking in movie background. But just as a brief introduction, it's the saga of the fictional Corleones, the most dominant of five New York crime syndicates in the 1940s. All of the major male characters engage in criminal activities, including murder, but following a mutually acknowledged code of behavior, the most basic of which is based on the law of the animal world: Show weakness or carelessness and you risk assassination. That message is brought home time after time, by spectacularly violent means. Yet for all the monstrous behavior you can't resist caring about - and even admiring - these characters. That's a triumph of storytelling. With Marlon Brando in the title role and relative newcomers Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton on their way to stardom. Nino Rota's score and title theme are now immortal, as are so many pieces of dialogue, including: ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse,"" and ""Leave the gun; take the cannoli."" Maybe its most amazing aspect, however, is although it won the Best-Picture Oscar, the motion-picture academy gave it only two others: best actor to Brando (who refused to accept it) and best adapted screenplay to Puzo. That means this classic is among the least-honored Oscar winners, despite its iconic status in the culture.Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)",5,"An extraordinary, immortal epic drama",1380499200,"09 30, 2013",2013,1721,"['Gone', 'Wind', 'Casablanca', 'quintessential', 'American', 'movie', 'one', 'greatest', 'Coppola', 'version', 'Mario', 'Puzo', 'historical', 'novel', 'New', 'York', 'gangster', 'family', 'rise', 'fall', 'landmark', 'become', 'so', 'famous', 'probably', 'introduction', 'description', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'one', ""'re"", 'woefully', 'lacking', 'movie', 'background', 'just', 'brief', 'introduction', 'saga', 'fictional', 'Corleones', 'most', 'dominant', 'five', 'New', 'York', 'crime', 'syndicates', '1940s', 'major', 'male', 'characters', 'engage', 'criminal', 'activities', 'including', 'murder', 'following', 'mutually', 'acknowledged', 'code', 'behavior', 'most', 'basic', 'based', 'law', 'animal', 'world', 'Show', 'weakness', 'carelessness', 'risk', 'assassination', 'message', 'brought', 'home', 'time', 'time', 'spectacularly', 'violent', 'means', 'monstrous', 'behavior', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'caring', 'even', 'admiring', 'characters', 'triumph', 'storytelling', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'title', 'role', 'relative', 'newcomers', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'James', 'Caan', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'way', 'stardom', 'Nino', 'Rota', 'score', 'title', 'theme', 'are', 'now', 'immortal', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'pieces', 'dialogue', 'including', ""'m"", 'gon', 'make', 'offer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'Leave', 'gun', 'take', 'cannoli', 'Maybe', 'most', 'amazing', 'aspect', 'however', 'won', 'Best-Picture', 'Oscar', 'motion-picture', 'academy', 'gave', 'only', 'two', 'others', 'best', 'actor', 'Brando', 'who', 'refused', 'accept', 'best', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'Puzo', 'classic', 'least-honored', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'iconic', 'status', 'culture.Phil', 'Favorite', '500', 'Loves', 'Moviegoing', 'Lifetime', '2014', 'edition']",The Godfather VHS

The movies influence is immeasurable and its status as a cultural icon is firmly entrenched in our collective consciousness.  But what makes this movie great?  It really has a simple plot: an aging mafia leader wishes to hand over his crime empire to one of his sons.  Through fate and happenstance, the one son, who originally wants nothing to do with the ""family business"" takes over and becomes the Don after the old man's death.  In and of itself, this story arc is at least as old as Shakespeare, but the way Coppola and Cinematographer Gordon Willis film and tell the story are what gives the Godfather its timelessness.  The story is beautiful in the way it juxtaposes moral attributes such as loyalty, self sacrifice and honor with terrible corruption, cruelty and unthinkable violence.  After the movie came out many viewers may have gotten a mixed message.  As such, many may have seen the good attributes of the characters as almost justifying their terrible actions.  Therefore, in order to be artistically and philosophically honest, Coppola had to make the second part.  At the end of the Godfather, Part I, we are almost sure that Michael has damned himself.  However, at the end of the second part, we are positive.  Thus, ""for what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, but lose his own soul?""

I'm not sure that ""The Godfather"" fits any of those categories but it certainly has to be considered as one of the greatest movies of all-time.  Francis Ford Coppola took an excellent engrossing, suspenseful book and turned it into a movie with the same qualities.  From the opening to the closing scene, everything about this movie was carefully planned, designed, and orchestrated.  It is a masterpiece of cinematic craftmanship.The acting is superb with Brando taking the prize in his portrayal of Don Corleone, the Godfather.  His raspy voice that suggested reason while disguising intrigue was one of the many keys to the effective tone of the movie.  There were scenes of violence, to be sure.  However, it was the quiet, calculated moves that created a greater sense of evil.  It was the implication of quiet yet ruthless planning that made the horse's head all the scarier.  Sonny (played very well by James Cann) did not understand the subtleties of evil whereas Michael (played even better by Al Pacino) did.The music was haunting, the costume were well-done, the cinematography was excellent, the writing outstanding but it was the directing that carries the movie.  I'm not sure whatever happened to Francis Ford Coppola.  I realize that he had other achievements, not the least of which was the sequel of ""Godfather II"".  However, this man displayed a talent seldom seen.  Maybe it was just the right mind and vision for the right project but it sure seemed that we would be seeing a lot more from this man.Everybody has at least one scene from ""The Godfather"" that has stayed with them more than others.  For many it is the horse's head, for others it's ""the offer he can't refuse"", while for others it may be something as subtle as the slowly closing door at the end of the movie.  Each of those images appeals to us on a different level.  ""The Godfather"" has worked its' way into our culture and why not?  It is a movie that appeals to most every movie goer from age 14 on up.  It is one of those movies that you can enjoy over and over again.

490735,A2IYUCI5A26O82,B000003KHS,R. Hansen,"[1, 1]","Television takes a pretty bad rap. It is often derided for its stultifying properties, engendering of abject values and overall ability to vitiate the masses. Many even claim that it foments a sundering influence over families. I suppose there is some merit to such an assertion, but I can tell you that when I was growing up the TV was the node in which our otherwise fragmented family coalesced. I guess we would be referred to as `dysfunctional' today; my father didn't talk to us much and the dinner table was a surface in which to set the groceries until they were put away. If my parents did ask about how school went, a laconic `alright' would satisfy. But when we sat in front of that glowing cynosure, with its exogenous felicity and fruition, our reticence faded into commentary. Somehow the factitious world contained in that electronic box inspired us to notice each other. We watched and we talked.So when it was deemed that I was mature enough to watch the network premier of `The Godfather' I was not only anticipating a good movie, I was looking forward to family bonding. I positively loved to listen to my father and older brothers (I'm the baby) engage in dialogue and repartee in response to the TV. Their insight brought more to light than my young mind could comprehend with just the presentation as is, and I felt edified as well as inclusive. Hey some folks have the visits to Yellowstone, I have this.Even though it was too much for an adolescent to fully appreciate, I knew then that this movie was something special. And as I grew older I watched it every time it aired. Of course after videos arrived this was the first movie I purchased. It is the cr&egrave;me de le cr&egrave;me of films, of which I have watched at least 50 times. It is a work of art that I can call a masterpiece without a bit of hyperbole. It is my opinion the greatest picture ever made.Though a substantial portion of the film takes place in Sicily, and many customs of that land (as well as cabala) are featured this is a very American story. It is no less than a stunning examination of the dichotomy that is success in the land of opportunity. It is a tale of the fine line between legitimacy and profligacy in the capitalist world, of the gray area that exists between transgression and ignominy. And if the film is a treatise on the American way then the opening line, `I believe in America', is its exordium. With those prefatory words Coppola sets the tone.What follows is a congeries of dexterous camera shots, first-rate dialogue, incredible acting, untiring character development and one hell of a story. The juxtaposition of criminality and family honor/personal loyalty is achieved with utmost precision. The motif of personal rectitude vis-&agrave;-vis societal ethos pervades the film. The main characters embody this paradox. They are vicious yet decorous, violent yet urbane, heartless yet not without code.The actors are at their best. Brando providing gravitas, Cann relishing his bellicose role, Keaton appearing to live her enduring conflict. It is Pacino of course who must steer the course, as his permutation is unveiled before us. Pacino achieves this vicissitude with a subtlety that resembles an insidious whisper, inaudible to those who underestimate him.If you will allow me an indulgence I would like to comment on the outstanding ending to this work. At times movies are often beloved for memorable scenes. The finale of this tale is as piquant as they come. Coppola understands the power of the doorway, and the shot of Kay's face, overcome with the realization of her husband's duplicity, as the door closes, symbolically shutting her out of his life, is sheer pathos. Did I mention that I love this ending? In fact the par excellence of this conclusion has soured me on the sequels. I have watched them and think they are great, but I do not possess them and never will. Any extension of this saga is a reproach to this superb terminus ad quem.`The Godfather' is a film that must be watched numerous times to absorb and appreciate the many names, nuances, and instances. I highly recommend it.",5,My favorite movie,1091577600,"08 4, 2004",2004,4128,"['Television', 'pretty', 'bad', 'rap', 'often', 'derided', 'stultifying', 'properties', 'engendering', 'abject', 'values', 'overall', 'ability', 'vitiate', 'masses', 'Many', 'even', 'claim', 'sundering', 'influence', 'families', 'suppose', 'merit', 'assertion', 'can', 'tell', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'TV', 'was', 'node', 'otherwise', 'fragmented', 'family', 'coalesced', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'referred', 'dysfunctional', 'today', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'talk', 'much', 'dinner', 'table', 'was', 'surface', 'set', 'groceries', 'were', 'put', 'away', 'parents', 'did', 'ask', 'how', 'school', 'went', 'laconic', 'alright', 'would', 'satisfy', 'when', 'sat', 'front', 'glowing', 'cynosure', 'exogenous', 'felicity', 'fruition', 'reticence', 'faded', 'commentary', 'Somehow', 'factitious', 'world', 'contained', 'electronic', 'box', 'inspired', 'notice', 'other', 'watched', 'talked.So', 'when', 'was', 'deemed', 'was', 'mature', 'enough', 'watch', 'network', 'premier', 'Godfather', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'anticipating', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'family', 'bonding', 'positively', 'loved', 'listen', 'father', 'older', 'brothers', ""'m"", 'baby', 'engage', 'dialogue', 'repartee', 'response', 'TV', 'insight', 'brought', 'more', 'light', 'young', 'mind', 'could', 'comprehend', 'just', 'presentation', 'felt', 'edified', 'as', 'well', 'inclusive', 'Hey', 'folks', 'have', 'visits', 'Yellowstone', 'have', 'this.Even', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'adolescent', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'knew', 'then', 'movie', 'was', 'something', 'special', 'grew', 'older', 'watched', 'time', 'aired', 'course', 'videos', 'arrived', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'purchased', 'cr', 'egrave', 'le', 'cr', 'egrave', 'films', 'have', 'watched', 'least', '50', 'times', 'work', 'art', 'can', 'call', 'masterpiece', 'bit', 'hyperbole', 'opinion', 'greatest', 'picture', 'ever', 'substantial', 'portion', 'film', 'place', 'Sicily', 'many', 'customs', 'land', 'as', 'well', 'cabala', 'are', 'featured', 'very', 'American', 'story', 'less', 'stunning', 'examination', 'dichotomy', 'success', 'land', 'opportunity', 'tale', 'fine', 'line', 'legitimacy', 'profligacy', 'capitalist', 'world', 'gray', 'area', 'transgression', 'ignominy', 'film', 'treatise', 'American', 'way', 'then', 'opening', 'line', 'believe', 'America', 'exordium', 'prefatory', 'words', 'Coppola', 'tone.What', 'congeries', 'dexterous', 'camera', 'shots', 'first-rate', 'dialogue', 'incredible', 'acting', 'untiring', 'character', 'development', 'one', 'hell', 'story', 'juxtaposition', 'criminality', 'family', 'honor/personal', 'loyalty', 'achieved', 'utmost', 'precision', 'motif', 'personal', 'rectitude', 'vis-', 'agrave', '-vis', 'societal', 'ethos', 'film', 'main', 'characters', 'embody', 'paradox', 'are', 'vicious', 'yet', 'decorous', 'violent', 'yet', 'urbane', 'heartless', 'yet', 'not', 'code.The', 'actors', 'are', 'best', 'Brando', 'providing', 'gravitas', 'Cann', 'relishing', 'bellicose', 'role', 'Keaton', 'appearing', 'live', 'enduring', 'conflict', 'Pacino', 'course', 'who', 'must', 'steer', 'course', 'permutation', 'unveiled', 'Pacino', 'vicissitude', 'subtlety', 'insidious', 'whisper', 'inaudible', 'who', 'underestimate', 'him.If', 'will', 'allow', 'indulgence', 'would', 'like', 'comment', 'outstanding', 'ending', 'work', 'times', 'movies', 'are', 'often', 'beloved', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'finale', 'tale', 'as', 'piquant', 'come', 'Coppola', 'power', 'doorway', 'shot', 'Kay', 'face', 'overcome', 'realization', 'husband', 'duplicity', 'door', 'closes', 'symbolically', 'shutting', 'life', 'sheer', 'pathos', 'Did', 'mention', 'love', 'ending', 'fact', 'par', 'excellence', 'conclusion', 'soured', 'sequels', 'have', 'watched', 'think', 'are', 'great', 'do', 'not', 'possess', 'never', 'will', 'extension', 'saga', 'reproach', 'superb', 'terminus', 'ad', 'quem.', 'Godfather', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'watched', 'numerous', 'times', 'absorb', 'appreciate', 'many', 'names', 'nuances', 'instances', 'highly', 'recommend']",The Godfather VHS

490740,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000003KHS,Robert Moore,"[9, 11]","A host of factors make this one of the greatest American films.  First, the directing is impeccable.  Coppola allows the story to unfold simply, employing for the most part a static, immobile camera, allowing each scene to unfold like a series of tableaux.  Second, the cinematography.  Most of the craft of the cinematography went into the lighting, which generates some of the greatest use of light and shadows since the demise of black and white film noir.  Coppola also intensifies each scene by using surprisingly little music in the film.  Although the film is famous for its outstanding score by Nina Rota (later discovered to have been partially reused from an obscure film he scored in the late 1950s in Italy, which led to his nomination for an Oscar to be withdrawn, an award he certainly would have won), the fact is that the music is used selectively and comparatively rarely.  Silence engulfs most of the scenes.  And although there are many famous lines in the film, it is driven as much by the silence between the characters as by what they say.  Also accounting for the brilliance of the film is the script, which is brilliant for its simplicity.  Coppola distills the tale down to only the most essential elements, with nearly every shot moving the story along or imparting a crucial piece of information to the viewer, allowing the crucial tensions of the story to unfold early on.  The enormous simplicity in the telling of the tale makes the more complex moments&#65533;for instance, the crosscutting during the baptismal scene&#65533;all that much more effective.  And any listing of all the reasons for the brilliance of the film leaving out the extraordinary art design would be woefully incomplete.  This was one of the first films made that made historical accuracy a high art form, and has exerted a profound influence on any historical film since then.Of course, one of the main reasons this is a great, great film is the acting.  Few films have ever featured so many memorable performances, and no film had featured so many performances by so many actors who were explicitly Italian.  In fact, the film was a &#65533;coming out&#65533; for one aspect of Italian culture in the United States.  Even in films that were fairly transparently about the Mafia and crime families in New York and Chicago, ethnicity was completely left out of the picture.  After THE GODFATHER, everything changed.  The film was Marlon Brando&#65533;s triumphant return to star status after a series of failures, garnering a well-served Oscar that he turned down.  The quality of the acting is shown by the fact that no less than three of the other actors&#65533;Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan&#65533;received nominations for Best Supporting Actor (Joel Grey won for CABERET, in what might have been the greatest group of performances in the history of Oscar for the award).There are a million stories that whirl around THE GODFATHER.  My favorite, and one of the happier accidents in casting history, was that originally Robert De Niro was cast in a small part in THE GODFATHER.  Al Pacino, on the other hand, was wanted for the part of Michael Corleone, but was already obligated for the film BANG THE DRUM SLOWLY.  Francis Ford Coppola worked out a deal whereby De Niro would replace Pacino in the one picture.  Unfortunately/fortunately this meant that De Niro was unable to be in THE GODFATHER, which meant that he was free to appear in THE GODFATHER II as the young Vito Corleone.  THE GODFATHER was a film where just about everything seemed to work out best for all involved, and this illustrates this perfectly.",5,One of the landmark films in American film history,1054339200,"05 31, 2003",2003,3633,"['host', 'factors', 'make', 'one', 'greatest', 'American', 'films', 'First', 'directing', 'impeccable', 'Coppola', 'story', 'unfold', 'simply', 'employing', 'most', 'part', 'static', 'immobile', 'camera', 'allowing', 'scene', 'unfold', 'series', 'tableaux', 'Second', 'cinematography', 'Most', 'craft', 'cinematography', 'went', 'lighting', 'greatest', 'use', 'light', 'shadows', 'demise', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'noir', 'Coppola', 'also', 'scene', 'using', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'music', 'film', 'film', 'famous', 'outstanding', 'score', 'Nina', 'Rota', 'later', 'discovered', 'have', 'been', 'partially', 'reused', 'obscure', 'film', 'scored', 'late', '1950s', 'Italy', 'led', 'nomination', 'Oscar', 'be', 'withdrawn', 'award', 'certainly', 'would', 'have', 'won', 'fact', 'music', 'used', 'selectively', 'comparatively', 'rarely', 'Silence', 'engulfs', 'most', 'scenes', 'are', 'many', 'famous', 'lines', 'film', 'driven', 'much', 'silence', 'characters', 'what', 'say', 'Also', 'accounting', 'brilliance', 'film', 'script', 'brilliant', 'simplicity', 'Coppola', 'tale', 'down', 'only', 'most', 'essential', 'elements', 'nearly', 'shot', 'moving', 'story', 'imparting', 'crucial', 'piece', 'information', 'viewer', 'allowing', 'crucial', 'tensions', 'story', 'unfold', 'early', 'enormous', 'simplicity', 'telling', 'tale', 'more', 'complex', 'moments', '65533', 'instance', 'crosscutting', 'baptismal', 'scene', '65533', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'listing', 'reasons', 'brilliance', 'film', 'leaving', 'out', 'extraordinary', 'art', 'design', 'would', 'be', 'woefully', 'incomplete', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'films', 'made', 'made', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'high', 'art', 'form', 'exerted', 'profound', 'influence', 'historical', 'film', 'then.Of', 'course', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'great', 'great', 'film', 'acting', 'Few', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'featured', 'so', 'many', 'memorable', 'performances', 'film', 'had', 'featured', 'so', 'many', 'performances', 'so', 'many', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'explicitly', 'Italian', 'fact', 'film', 'was', '65533', 'coming', 'out', '65533', 'one', 'aspect', 'Italian', 'culture', 'United', 'States', 'Even', 'films', 'were', 'fairly', 'transparently', 'Mafia', 'crime', 'families', 'New', 'York', 'Chicago', 'ethnicity', 'was', 'completely', 'left', 'out', 'picture', 'GODFATHER', 'everything', 'changed', 'film', 'was', 'Marlon', 'Brando', '65533', 's', 'triumphant', 'return', 'star', 'status', 'series', 'failures', 'garnering', 'well-served', 'Oscar', 'turned', 'down', 'quality', 'acting', 'shown', 'fact', 'less', 'three', 'other', 'actors', '65533', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'James', 'Caan', '65533', 'received', 'nominations', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'won', 'CABERET', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'greatest', 'group', 'performances', 'history', 'Oscar', 'award', 'are', 'million', 'stories', 'whirl', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'My', 'favorite', 'one', 'happier', 'accidents', 'casting', 'history', 'was', 'originally', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'was', 'cast', 'small', 'part', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'wanted', 'part', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'was', 'already', 'obligated', 'film', 'BANG', 'THE', 'DRUM', 'SLOWLY', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'worked', 'out', 'deal', 'whereby', 'De', 'Niro', 'would', 'replace', 'Pacino', 'one', 'picture', 'Unfortunately/fortunately', 'meant', 'De', 'Niro', 'was', 'unable', 'be', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'meant', 'was', 'free', 'appear', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'II', 'young', 'Vito', 'Corleone', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'was', 'film', 'where', 'just', 'everything', 'seemed', 'work', 'out', 'best', 'involved', 'perfectly']",The Godfather VHS
490741,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B000003KHS,Robert Morris,"[7, 7]","After I purchased Mario Puzo's novel, I stayed up most of that night reading it. Two years later, this film adaptation appeared and I have since seen it (as well as Godfather Part II) more than a dozen times. Francis Ford Coppola deserves all of the praise and awards these films have received over the years. He should also be admired for insisting that Pacino and Brando be cast in two of the major roles despite strong opposition from Paramount. Coppola assembled a superb cast but also an equally talented crew. Those who share my high regard for it no doubt have their own favorite scenes. Mine include Michael's enlistment of a bewildered young man's assistance at the hospital until members of the Corleone family arrive to protect their don, the sequence in the restaurant which results in the killing of Sollozzo and McCluskey, Tom Hagen's discussion with Jack Woltz during dinner, Michael's reunion conversation with Kay as they stroll in a New England village, and the montage of executions during the baptism. None of the extensive violence in the film seems gratuitous. Each major character is fully developed. The cinematography and score are outstanding, although neither was even nominated for an Academy Award. Dark as this film often is, it also has its lighter moments, as during the wedding celebration when Luca Brasi rehearses his remarks before presenting a gift and later when Clemenza teases Michael good-naturedly about Kay Adams. For me, the single most interesting element in the film is Michael's gradual development from his family's baby brother (albeit a war hero) to its ruthlessly efficient don. Once he volunteers to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey, his destiny is assured. In some respects, this film reminds me of an opera but one with a multi-dimensional plot as well as grandeur in its style, scope, and emotional impact. In 1998, the American Film Institute selected The Godfather as one of the three greatest American films.

Within weeks of its release, it was clearly a blockbuster, a cinematic phenomenon, an exquisite Mafia epic with outstanding performances... Coppola got everything right, creating a landmark in American cinema...His film acutely details the inner workings of the criminal ""families,"" and the ruthlessness of those in organized crime, but also examines their steadfast loyalty, love for blood relations, and code of ethics... Coppola and Puzo subtly weave a complex narrative with themes of hypocrisy, power, and corruption which stands as a pulsating reflection of our uncertain times...With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando creates a personage that will be remembered for ever... The line ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" has reached legendary statues... Brando's Don Corleone is the moral center of the film: a tough, wise, feared old Sicilian who has risen to become an all powerful leader in an empire of Italian-American organized crime...While crime may be the first image that comes into one's mind in the film, violence plays a vital part in this complicated tale... Brando is the head of one of the five families who are said to control the Mafia in the area of New York... He is opposed to any involvement in drugs, and refuses to risk his political contacts and prestige for such putrefied money... He is behind the time but he understands that society is not alarmed by ""liquor, gambling, and even women..."" He is also a loving family man... His sons, relatives and friends are part of his operations... He despises displays of weakness... He understands the strength of power and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the ""sovereignty."" In the outdoor garden, father and son are affectionate to each other, but cannot express their emotions openly...The Corleones are a warm, close family and the motion picture (with l0 Oscar Nominations) shows the flavor of Italian-American home life... Don Corleone is an undisputed patriarch, and as played by Brando, he has almost the manner of a religious leader... His voice is quite and rasping, his chin stands as a symbol of his authority, and men kisses his hand as they ask for his favors... He is a charismatic leader and his eyes reflect his kind heart as his implacability...Pacino's gradual and subtle transformation is the heart of the film... From a gentle man to one of the most cunning, ruthless, and cold-blooded man ever to come on the screen, he has learned from his father never to talk in front of outsiders and always keep his own counsel... His commandment ""Never to take sides against the Family.""The opening shot of ""The Godfather"" sets the tone of the film as Don Corleone and some of his family listen to an undertaker, Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Cirsitto), pleading for justice for the near-rape and brutal beating suffered by his daughter...Attending the wedding of his sister Connie to young bookmaker Carlo Rizzi, Michael, a highly decorated Marine captain from World War II, points out the other guests to Kate (Diane Keaton), his non-Italian girlfriend... In the same time Coppola introduces us to his large cast of characters:Sonny (James Caan), the rough, hot-headed impulsive kid who never really grew up; Fredo (John Cazale), the troubled, shy, weak young man who can't seem to do anything right;

Marlon Brando will always be The Godfather, in one of the great performances in movie history.  Robert Duvall as Tom Hagan, James Caan as Sonny Corleone, and of course Al Pacino as Michael Corleone all are perfectly cast, and all turn in simply perfect performances.  The supporting cast is equally good.  In my opinion there simply is nothing about this film not to like.  The Godfather was one of the great American novels of the 20th Century, and this film absolutely does it justice and brings to the screen a great piece of Americana concerning the immigrant experience in 20th Century America.In particular, the wistful sub-plot of Michael in exile in Sicily is hauntingly and beautifully done.  This is one of those films in which the musical score adds a great deal to the viewing experience, and in particular the theme music for the Sicily scenes is classic and unforgettable.One of the strengths of the story, both in film and novel, is that although the characters with whom the viewer identifies are gangsters, in no way does this film glorify the mafia or organized crime, which instead are portrayed as ultimately self-destructive institutions, particularly in the fine sequel to this film: Godfather II (which is every bit as good as The Godfather, albeit missing Brando's magnificent presence).This is the kind of film that comes along only once or twice in a generation (if we are lucky), and every film afficianado will want this DVD in his or her collection.

If you're respectful, he'll do you a favor.  If not, well -- swim with the fishes.Mario Puzo's novel comes to life with the five crime families sorting out their turf in 1946 gangsterland New York.Behind the parties and the family togetherness there's an undercurrent of competitiveness that rears its head with the Solotso guys who want to make some narcotics sales and thus invite the Corleones for a piece of the action and thus help the family businesses.Things go from bad to worse for the Corleone family.  Their refusal to get into narcotics gets Brando's character (Vito) shot and near death.  His boys go into action but at the risk of getting killed, decide to meet Bruno for the ultimate show-down.  And hey, let's get rid of that cop that is on Solotso's payroll.Great film:  1940's gangland is tough, with their Fedora hats and cool 40s Chevy's rolling around.  I almost expected some tommyguns!I was reminded in the re-watch about the horse's head in the bed.  Don't cross the family!Robert Duval is Tom, the family's lawyer, basically.  He is the level-headed, logical one who wants to do business without blood.  Mike (Al Pacino) the ""war hero"" wants back in on the family business and to protect his father.  Sonny just wants to blow everyone away!The film's complex story and interweaving plot make a plot summary difficult.  You just have to see it.  Intense drama with some comedic elements, it clearly deserved the Academy Awards from the 70s.

There are two main characters but let's start with the head. Marlon Brando plays Vito Corleone head of the Corleone crime syndacite, one of the many families that dominates New York at this current time. He has a daughter and three sons, Fredo, Sonny and most importantly Micheal played wonderfully by Al Pacino. Young Micheal though is no gangster but a young boy next door who is full of potential. Micheal has only one dream, not to be like his family, not to become a ruthless gangster.Through the course of the film Vito is offered money to share his powerful connections with a rival gang which is not going to happen and this can mean only one thing, war! War that will lead to Sonny being double crossed and murdered and leading to Vito having many attempts on his life which he miraculously survives. When Vito dies and with Sonny dead it is Micheals turn to head the family which he accepts and does all to well...This film introduced the whole 'horses head on your pillow' thing which is a scene in the beggining. It also features the moment when Micheal turns gangster, murdering two other figure heads in a New York restraunt at point blank range.How anyone can say they haven't seen the Godfather is beyond me and I'm sure you'll agree with me. In my opinion this is even better than Part II and by a long way the best mafia flick to this day.

490758,AT07UZQQR7ZEH,B000003KHS,"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[4, 5]","Francis Ford Coppola's THE GODFATHER (1972) may be the best movie ever made that no one in my family wants to borrow from my large private DVD collection.  They say it is too long  (it really isn't) and much too violent (it is).  Ironically, the graphic violence may be one reason we have the version of THE GODFATHER that gangster film devotees love so much.  Listen to the illuminating commentary by Coppola on the DVD.  He was young and constantly under pressure from Paramount executives to shoot the movie faster and make it more violent, or face firing.  The exquisite wedding sequence in reel one is a good example--executives demanded it be filmed in three days or else, so scenes with Al Pacino and Diane Keaton talking at a side table were shot at night with tons of light to look like daytime and to cinematographer Gordon Willis' justified anger as a perfectionist.  And a later scene with Talia Shire getting beaten up by her husband was shot by Coppola with the fear of being replaced if he did not add more violence to the movie.It was a low-budget film ($2.5 million) that blossomed up to $6.5 million.  The Hollywood exterior scenes with John Marley were done with long shot doubles and a second unit crew.  (But the infamous horse's head in bed scene WAS done by Coppola in New York.)  Ironically, the first week of filming went very smoothly and included two full nights to film the killing of the violent police captain (Sterling Hayden) and his henchman in the restaurant.  In any event, the first GODFATHER film was a very hard movie to make.  Producer Robert Evans, coming off LOVE STORY, even wanted to replace Nino Rota's incomparably lovely score with something more schmaltzy, until an enthusiastic public screening of the movie convinced him to stay with Rota.At 175 minutes, THE GODFATHER a towering gangster film achievement with flawless performances and solid writing.  (The studio executives were so brutal to Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role that he refused to come back for the 1974 sequel, even for just a cameo.  And the ""shirts"" also were not very keen on Al Pacino as Michael, not even after the restaurant massacre in week one.)  Note the plotting and the way light and dark contrast--not just dramatically, but also visually.  Take the opening reel and the way undertaker Bonasera is talking to Vito Corleone (Brando, and an improvised cat to stroke as he talked) in a darkened study, all golds and browns, while a gorgeous sun-lit wedding reception for Vito's daughter is taking place outside.  The whole movie has juxtapositions like this to make it a special gangster film.  All the way to the last reel, where the baptism of Michael's infant son (really baby Sofia Coppola!) in a cathedral is intercut with terrible murders happening all over greater New York City.Dean Tavoularis' production design and Anna Hill Johnstone's costumes deserve special mention in their extraordinary detail, especially the shops in Little Italy and just the right clothes for everyone on the sidewalks and in the streets.  Their work is magnificent.And I love the Sicily scenes with Al Pacino's Michael hiding out for a couple of years after killing the police captain in the New York restaurant.  Michael falls in love with and marries a beautiful Sicilian bride, with Nino Rota's exquisite ""Love Theme"" music on the soundtrack.  Their evocative wedding will contrast against the bride being subsequently blown up in a car, which sends Michael back home to Diane Keaton's nurturing Kay.I also love a later scene that a moron Paramount executive wanted cut out because it allegedly did not advance the plot--the death of Brando's Vito Corleone of a heart attack while playing in a tomato vineyard with his young son.  Fortunately, this classic scene stayed in and adds great beauty on either side of darker scenes.  In fact, Coppola says on the audio commentary that Robert Evans eventually came to his rescue when Evans saw that he had a potential masterpiece and blockbuster on his hands--Evans insisted that scene after scene be put back into a movie that was originally about two hours and slowly creeped up to its present 175 minutes.  Hollywood moviemaking is a crapshoot and a crazy, stressful game.  God must have been looking down on the 30 year old director and co-writer more than a few times.In the final analysis, it is the constant blending of romance and violence, both dramatically and visually, that makes THE GODFATHER such a special gangster film masterpiece.  It blends flawless acting, strong writing, authoritative direction, world-class sets and costumes, magnificent (and very underrated) photography, and the loveliest of lovely music scores to be one of the great works of art of the American cinema.  Now if only I could get my own family to watch my DVD of it and its even better 1974 sequel!",5,The gangster film summit,1150761600,"06 20, 2006",2006,4854,"['Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'THE',

The main plot is the external plot to Save the Corleone family. Supporting plots include the external plot of Michael becoming an insider of the family and an internal plot of Michael's morality.Michael starts out an idealistic young man who looks down on the dirty deeds of the family business. In the end, Michael save the Corleone family. But in order to do so, he has become the ultimate insider (the Don) and loses the values he had held so dear at the beginning.It's a classic story that can be argued to humanize a criminal family by making us a member of it through Michael's transformation. The stakes are laid out such that we have to believe the ends justify the means. This idea, to protect the family at any cost, is taken to its logical extreme in the sequel, The Godfather: Part II and then the pied piper comes calling for payback in the finale The Godfather: Part III. But Part I is what stands apart from its distinctive internal arc of Michael. In the other two movies, Michael's determination and moral center never wavers, we just see the external world's consequences of his moral choices.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.",3,Family above all other values,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,1290,"['Godfather', 'idea', 'family', 'other', 'values', 'letting', 'experience', 'idea', 'three', 'plots', 'main', 'plot', 'external', 'plot', 'Save', 'Corleone', 'family', 'Supporting', 'plots', 'include', 'external', 'plot', 'Michael', 'becoming', 'insider', 'family', 'internal', 'plot', 'Michael', 'morality.Michael', 'out', 'idealistic', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'down', 'dirty', 'deeds', 'family', 'business', 'end', 'Michael', 'save', 'Corleone', 'family', 'order', 'do', 'so', 'become', 'ultimate', 'insider', 'Don', 'values', 'had', 'held', 'so', 'dear', 'beginning.It', 'classic', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'argued', 'humanize', 'criminal', 'family', 'making', 'member', 'Michael', 'transformation', 'stakes', 'are', 'laid', 'out', 'such', 'have', 'believe', 'ends', 'justify', 'means', 'idea', 'protect', 'family', 'cost', 'taken', 'logical', 'extreme', 'sequel', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'II', 'then', 'pied', 'piper', 'calling', 'payback', 'finale', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'III', 'Part', 'what', 'apart', 'distinctive', 'internal', 'arc', 'Michael', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'Michael', 'determination', 'moral', 'center', 'never', 'wavers', 'just', 'see', 'external', 'world', 'consequences', 'moral', 'choices.My', 'Story', 'Chart', 'movie', 'storycharts.ca']",The Godfather VHS

The Godfather belongs in the same catagory of greatness. That Francis Ford Coppola made one of the best movies in history from one of best novels in history (Mario Puzo's Godfather)is indeed a rare marvel.It's like all the planets were aligned and brought perfection together. The script, the cast, the director, the time.Marlon Brando is magnificent as Don Vito Corleone, mafia lord of one of New York's five crime families. That Brando could so perfectly display a gentleness of heart and yet a violence of the soul within the same man is astounding. You are compelled to love and adore Don Corleone as well as despise him, only Brando could do this. What girl would not want him for her daddy, what man would not be devastated to have him as an enemy ? How could this be topped ?  By Al Pacino.As Michael,the youngest son of the Don who wanted nothing to do with the dirty business of his father, declaring to his girlfriend when speaking of his father's ""business"", ""That's my family, Kay. It's not me."". Nobody wanted Pacino to play Michael, no one but Pacino and Coppola, and Coppola fought hard to get him in the movie. Every major male star in Hollywood wanted this part. A little trivia ** Pacino's grandparents were from Corleone, Sicily.Pacino is astounding. How can you put on celluloid the slow hardening of a man's heart ? This is Pacino's task and he captures the hardening of Michael's heart, we can almost see the warmth in his eyes, cool.

490766,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B000003KHS,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[2, 3]","Director:  Francis Ford CoppolaCast:  Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, Al Lettieri, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Gianni Russo.Running Time: 175 minutesRated R for violence and language.""The Godfather"" has the word classic written all over and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques ""The Godfather"" has not been as revolutionary as ""Citizen Kane"", but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for ""gangster movies"", but its influence goes well beyond that.  ""The Godfather""'s influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every ""organized crime film"" nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in ""The Godfather"". The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination.  But to say that ""The Godfather"" is simply ""influential"" is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as ""a movie about gangsters"". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was ""The Godfather"". Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.  However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.  To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his ""innocence"" and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.  There has been much speculation on how the events in ""The Godfather"" novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an expos? of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane, for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people.  The cinematography of ""The Godfather"" is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.  The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.",5,The Godfather  (1972),1146355200,"04 30,

Firstly a scene in which he is trying to muster up the conviction to shoot the person who has made an attempt on his father's life, the suspense echoed by the sound of an impending train.  Secondly, near the end, the scene jumps between the christening of his own godson (and his own baptism) and the planned killing of all his foes by his design - showing the true extremes of his character and the depths of cold-hearted evil he has now reached.Great film, worth much of it's hype",4,Worth the hype,1217462400,"07 31, 2008",2008,1048,"['great', 'film', ""'m"", 'glad', 'finally', 'got', 'seeing', 'years', 'saying', 'would', 'wonderfully', 'menacing', 'presence', 'Brando', 'complex', 'character', 'Michael', 'played', 'Pacino', 'epic', 'ups', 'downs', 'family', 'played', 'out', 'inspired', 'direction', 'Ford', 'Coppola.One', 'strongest', 'parts', 'film', 'gradual', 'irreversable', 'change', 'Pacino', 'character', 'respected', 'war', 'veteran', 'beginning', 'less', 'subtle', 'version', 'violent', 'powerful', 'father', 'end.2', 'scenes', 'stuck', 'out', 'showing', 'beautfully', 'Firstly', 'scene', 'trying', 'muster', 'up', 'conviction', 'shoot', 'person', 'who', 'made', 'attempt', 'father', 'life', 'suspense', 'echoed', 'sound', 'impending', 'train', 'Secondly', 'end', 'scene', 'jumps', 'christening', 'own', 'godson', 'own', 'baptism', 'planned', 'killing', 'foes', 'design', 'showing', 'true', 'extremes', 'character', 'depths', 'cold-hearted', 'evil', 'now', 'reached.Great', 'film', 'worth', 'much', 'hype']",The Godfather VHS

The movie tells the story of the Corleone family, one of the Five Families in New York City.  Headed by Don Vito Corleone, the family must survive in the changing times after World War II as the drug industry begins to spread in America.  The Godfather must try and hold his family and empire together against the other mafia families, but also against his own family.  This movie has become an important part of American pop culture for good reason.  The movie is full of great characters, fantastic one-liners, the instantly recognizable theme, and the  still alarming violence.  This is a great movie that should not be missed by movie fans everywhere.Marlon Brando fully deserved his Academy Award for his performance as Vito Corleone, the head of the powerful Corleone family in NYC.  This was also the movie to skyrocket Al Pacino to the top as Michael Corleone who takes charge of the family when everything begins to go wrong.  The impressive cast includes James Caan as the hot-tempered Sonny, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Richard Castellano as Clemenza, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams, and Sterling Hayden as corrupt cop, Captain McCluskey.  The movie also stars John Marley, Abe Vigoda, Al Lettieri, Talia Shire, and Richard Conte.  The DVD offers a great-looking widescreen presentation and commentary from director Francis Ford Coppola.

A friend of mine asked how I can consider myself a movie reviewer, when I haven't even seen the film that is widely considered to be the best of all-time. He had a point, so I decided to rent it and my verdict is it. While the Godfather is a tremendous epic drama, I really don't see how it is considered to be the best film ever made. It's a great story, with a superstar cast, which set the genre for all the mafia films that followed, but that in and of itself means the film is going to have problems. As with other mafia films, it's difficult to keep track of who's who in the large cast. It also moves rather quickly and viewers like myself are going to have a very difficult time of trying to follow the erratic timeline of the film. Some parts move at a snails pace, while other just fly by, and what is with the music? The soundtrack is almost as acclaimed as the film, but honestly if I had to hear that song one more time, during this three hour epic, I may have gone out and killed someone myself. For those unfamiliar with the story, it follows the evolution of the Corleone family, as they transition from one leader to the next. The story is fantastic and is the furthest thing from predictable that you will ever find. It is filed with classic scenes and renowned performance from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, but I really have a hard time calling such a complicated story with that much violence, the best of all-time. The Godfather is a terrific movie, and I'm glad that I finally got to see it, but in a word, the film is overrated.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1403481600,"06 23, 2014",2014,1603,"[""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'Godfather', 'prior', 'weekend', 'friend', 'mine', 'asked', 'how', 'can', 'consider', 'movie', 'reviewer', 'when', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'seen', 'film', 'widely', 'considered', 'be', 'best', 'all-time', 'had', 'point', 'decided', 'rent', 'verdict', 'Godfather', 'tremendous', 'epic', 'drama', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'considered', 'be', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'great', 'story', 'superstar', 'cast', 'set', 'genre', 'mafia', 'films', 'followed', 'film', 'going', 'have', 'problems', 'other', 'mafia', 'films', 'difficult', 'keep', 'track', 'who', 'who', 'large', 'cast', 'also', 'rather', 'quickly', 'viewers', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'very', 'difficult', 'time', 'trying', 'follow', 'erratic', 'timeline', 'film', 'parts', 'move', 'snails', 'pace', 'other', 'just', 'fly', 'what', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'almost', 'as', 'acclaimed', 'film', 'honestly', 'had', 'hear', 'song', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'three', 'hour', 'epic', 'may', 'have', 'gone', 'out', 'killed', 'someone', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'evolution', 'Corleone', 'family', 'transition', 'one', 'leader', 'next', 'story', 'fantastic', 'furthest', 'thing', 'predictable', 'will', 'ever', 'find', 'filed', 'classic', 'scenes', 'renowned', 'performance', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'really', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'calling', 'complicated', 'story', 'much', 'violence', 'best', 'all-time', 'Godfather', 'terrific', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'finally', 'got', 'see', 'word', 'film', 'overrated']",The Godfather VHS

490777,A3N110LGDXE6FH,B000003KHS,Veronica,"[4, 6]","You can't help but come to watch the Godfather with a lot of preconceptions.  It was always a film I just never got around to watching, but when I saw it was Number 1 in the Internet Movie Database Chart of greatest ever films I just had to watch it.  Now I've seen it, I don't know if I'd call it the greatest ever, but it is certainly a dazzling film that stands up to repeated viewings and has quality stamped all over it from beginning to end.  I never realised how big an impact the film had, for example, I didn't realise that 'swim with the fishes' and 'I'll make him an offer he can't refuse' came from the Godfather.All of the acting performances are great.  Al Pacino really surprised me with his charismatic performance as Michael Corleone, the man who changes from a war hero not involved in the family business to a man at the very heart of his crime family.  By the end of the film I literally could not drag my eyes away from him, he has such a strong and powerful presence, which is amazing considering that I didn't think he was the most imposing of men at first glance.  There is something inevitable about Michael's transformation, and to me it was his own decision - what he does, he does willingly, with his eyes wide open to the consequences.  Perhaps that is the most chilling - and tragic - thing of all about this film.Marlon Brando was also great as Don Vito Corleone.  He gives truly a unique performance and somehow manages to make his whole face, body, voice and general demeanour take on the persona of his character - something that, unfortunately, few actors achieve.  As I said, all the performances were great, but I just have to mention Robert Duvall, who plays Tom Hagen, the Don's adopted son and right hand man, with a seriousness and depth that was very impressive.  James Caan was also great at the short-tempered son who was never going to be suitable to become Don.  Finally, it was great to see Talia Shire, who was so good in Rocky, play a completely different character with the same level of competence.One of my only criticisms of the film is that after the wonderful intense love story between Michael and Apollonia ends so sadly, the movie seems to speed up and the years go by too quickly.  I would have liked more explanation about why Michael goes back to Kay and what he was feeling at the time.  I kind of felt that was left unresolved to some extent.The 'Godfather' also highlights the utter futility of a life of murder and crime.  If someone kills a member of your family, you must kill one of theirs, and then they kill someone else and so on...The 'family' must be protected at all costs, but this protection takes the form of violence, vengeance and control, and is ultimately - and ironically - what pulls the family apart. One of the most interesting ideas about the film for me is what the notion of 'respect' and 'honour' actually mean - and whether these things can ever be gained through murder and fear.The role of women in the film is also fascinating.  Kay and Michael are in love at the beginning, but he still leaves her and ends up marrying Appollina, with whom he falls in love with in a very different way.  Kay is the wrong woman for Michael as she is too outspoken and doesn't want the Corleone family to continue with a life of crime.  She should have said no to his proposal, but she was still 'in love' with the Michael she used to know before he decided to take over from his father.  The ideal wife for Michael was Apollonia, who would have been exactly like his own mother - quietly raising children and never asking about the business.  Michael's power, magnetic presence and protectiveness are undoutedbly very attractive, and I found myself in the weird situation of being repelled by his actions and yet drawn towards these qualities.  In the long run, though, being married to that type of man means a woman has to remain childlike - never discussing important matters or asking questions.  In addition, the women are complicit to the violence, they know it goes on even if they say nothing - crucially they all know they are raising their own children for more of the same.Overall, I'd say the Godfather stands up to the hype surrounding it, which is an amazing achievement in itself!  It's a serious, entertaining and compelling film that makes you think.  Like everybody else, I'm sure, I just wish there were more films made that manage to reach these heights.",5,Quality,1172188800,"02 23, 2007",2007,4451,"['ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'come', 'watch', 'Godfather', 'lot', 'preconceptions', 'was', 'always', 'film', 'just', 'never', 'got', 'watching', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'Number', '1', 'Internet', 'Movie', 'Database', 'Chart', 'greatest', 'ever', 'films', 'just', 'had', 'watch', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'d"", 'call', 'greatest', 'ever', 'certainly', 'dazzling', 'film', 'up', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'quality', 'stamped', 'beginning', 'end', 'never', 'realised', 'how', 'big', 'impact', 'film', 'had', 'example', 'did', ""n't"", 'realise', 'fishes', ""'ll"", 'make', 'offer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'came', 'Godfather.All', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'really', 'surprised', 'charismatic', 'performance', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'man', 'who', 'war', 'hero', 'not', 'involved', 'family', 'business', 'man', 'very', 'heart', 'crime', 'family', 'end', 'film', 'literally', 'could', 'not', 'drag', 'eyes', 'away', 'strong', 'powerful', 'presence', 'amazing', 'considering', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'most', 'imposing', 'men', 'first', 'glance', 'something', 'inevitable', 'Michael', 'transformation', 'was', 'own', 'decision', 'what', 'willingly', 'eyes', 'wide', 'open', 'consequences', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'chilling', 'tragic', 'thing', 'film.Marlon', 'Brando', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'Don', 'Vito', 'Corleone', 'truly', 'unique', 'performance', 'somehow', 'manages', 'make', 'whole', 'face', 'body', 'voice', 'general', 'demeanour', 'take', 'persona', 'character', 'something', 'unfortunately', 'few', 'actors', 'achieve', 'said', 'performances', 'were', 'great', 'just', 'have', 'mention', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'who', 'Tom', 'Hagen', 'Don', 'adopted', 'son', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'seriousness', 'depth', 'was', 'very', 'impressive', 'James', 'Caan', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'short-tempered', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'suitable', 'become', 'Don', 'Finally', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'Rocky', 'play', 'completely', 'different', 'character', 'same', 'level', 'competence.One', 'only', 'criticisms', 'film', 'wonderful', 'intense', 'love', 'story', 'Michael', 'Apollonia', 'so', 'sadly', 'movie', 'speed', 'up', 'years', 'go', 'too', 'quickly', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'explanation', 'why', 'Michael', 'back', 'Kay', 'what', 'was', 'feeling', 'time', 'kind', 'felt', 'was', 'left', 'unresolved', 'extent.The', 'also', 'utter', 'futility', 'life', 'murder', 'crime', 'someone', 'member', 'family', 'must', 'kill', 'one', 'theirs', 'then', 'kill', 'someone', 'else', 'so', ""'family"", 'must', 'be', 'protected', 'costs', 'protection', 'form', 'violence', 'vengeance', 'control', 'ultimately', 'ironically', 'what', 'family', 'apart', 'One', 'most', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'film', 'what', 'notion', ""'respect"", ""'honour"", 'actually', 'mean', 'things', 'can', 'ever', 'be', 'gained', 'murder', 'fear.The', 'role', 'women', 'film', 'also', 'fascinating', 'Kay', 'Michael', 'are', 'love', 'beginning', 'still', 'up', 'marrying', 'Appollina', 'whom', 'love', 'very', 'different', 'way', 'Kay', 'wrong', 'woman', 'Michael', 'too', 'outspoken', ""n't"", 'want', 'Corleone', 'family', 'continue', 'life', 'crime', 'should', 'have', 'said', 'proposal', 'was', 'still', ""'in"", 'love', 'Michael', 'used', 'know', 'decided', 'take', 'over', 'father', 'ideal', 'wife', 'Michael', 'was', 'Apollonia', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'exactly', 'own', 'mother', 'quietly', 'raising', 'children', 'never', 'asking', 'business', 'Michael', 'power', 'magnetic', 'presence', 'protectiveness', 'are', 'undoutedbly', 'very', 'attractive', 'found', 'weird', 'situation', 'being', 'repelled', 'actions', 'yet', 'drawn', 'qualities', 'long', 'run', 'though', 'being', 'married', 'type', 'man', 'woman', 'remain', 'childlike', 'never', 'discussing', 'important', 'matters', 'asking', 'questions', 'addition', 'women', 'are', 'complicit', 'violence', 'know', 'even', 'say', 'nothing', 'crucially', 'know', 'are', 'raising', 'own', 'children', 'more', 'same.Overall', ""'d"", 'say', 'Godfather', 'up', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'amazing', 'achievement', 'serious', 'entertaining', 'compelling', 'film', 'think', 'everybody', 'else', ""'m"", 'sure', 'just', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'films', 'made', 'manage', 'reach', 'heights']",The Godfather VHS

Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, comes back from World War II as a hero. His family are leading mobsters and it is a life he wants to reject, but his hand is forced when his father, Don Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, is shot down in the street. Slowly and reluctantly, he gets sucked into the vortex of the Mob, proving himself every bit as ruthless as his rivals.This film reveals perfectly the analogy between 20th Century gangsters and the aristocracy. Not the effete aristocracy of the modern age but that of antiquity: when brutality and nobility went together; when power came from brute strength. This is what Thomas Paine had to say about the aristocracy:""It could have been no difficult thing....for a banditti of ruffians to overrun a country [and] their power being thus established, the chief of the band contrived to lose the name of Robber in that of monarch and hence the origin of Monarchy and Kings."" 'The Rights of Man.'If Don Corleone had been born in the pre-democratic age, his descendants would now have lands and respectable titles. Don Corleone insists people call him Godfather: In a previous age it would have been King, Duke, Baron, or Prince. It all means the same. Splendour sits side by side with violence. There are no ethics, only power. Everything else is a faade.This was made in the 70s, when Coppola made genuinely great films. It's a compelling story beautifully told. The pacing is steady but never slow. The performances are flawless: the cinematography beautiful. Come the 80s, his genius would desert him.
