333726,A20EEWWSFMZ1PN,6302784743,"bernie ""xyzzy""","[16, 17]","11 year-old Anna Hart (Martha Byne) seems to have some problems dealing with people, she also has a few problems like kleptomania, and being amoral. Her neighbor and piano teacher Michaela Dupont/Anna Parkhurst (Donna Mitchell) is not helping; if anything she seems to be aggravating the situation (or is she supposed to be guiding the child to some end. Her mother Sarah (Dina Merrill), tends to look the other way as she seems to know something that anna does not.One night Anna sees her doppelganger on TV and decides to investigate; this will lead her to a secret about herself and a person once known as Anna Zimmerman. Often overlooked is the help and support she receives from her older brother Rowann (Mark Patton.)There is a lot of danger and mystery to the story. As it unfolds there are some twists and turns. You will find your self kibitzing during potential escape scenes. In the end you decide who the good guys are and who the bad are.The movie was based on a novel 1983 ""Anna to the Infinite Power"" by Mildred Ames. The Novel and movie are closely aligned.What is missing from the book is the haunting sound of ""Anna's Reverie"" written by composer Paul Baillargeon Sung by Christine Andreas German Lyrics by Charles & Marion Linton.If you find this film intriguing then you may want to read the Replica book series by Marilyn Kaye, starting with ""Amy Number Seven.""",5,A great conspiracy movie,1120176000,"07 1, 2005",2005,1382,"['11', 'year-old', 'Anna', 'Hart', 'Martha', 'Byne', 'have', 'problems', 'dealing', 'people', 'also', 'few', 'problems', 'kleptomania', 'being', 'amoral', 'neighbor', 'piano', 'teacher', 'Michaela', 'Dupont/Anna', 'Parkhurst', 'Donna', 'Mitchell', 'not', 'helping', 'anything', 'be', 'aggravating', 'situation', 'supposed', 'be', 'guiding', 'child', 'end', 'mother', 'Sarah', 'Dina', 'Merrill', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'know', 'something', 'anna', 'not.One', 'night', 'Anna', 'doppelganger', 'TV', 'decides', 'investigate', 'will', 'lead', 'secret', 'person', 'once', 'known', 'Anna', 'Zimmerman', 'Often', 'overlooked', 'help', 'support', 'older', 'brother', 'Rowann', 'Mark', 'Patton', 'lot', 'danger', 'mystery', 'story', 'are', 'twists', 'turns', 'will', 'find', 'self', 'kibitzing', 'potential', 'escape', 'scenes', 'end', 'decide', 'who', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'who', 'bad', 'are.The', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'novel', '1983', 'Anna', 'Infinite', 'Power', 'Mildred', 'Ames', 'Novel', 'movie', 'are', 'closely', 'aligned.What', 'missing', 'book', 'haunting', 'sound', 'Anna', 'Reverie', 'written', 'composer', 'Paul', 'Baillargeon', 'Sung', 'Christine', 'Andreas', 'German', 'Lyrics', 'Charles', 'Marion', 'Linton.If', 'find', 'film', 'intriguing', 'then', 'may', 'want', 'read', 'Replica', 'book', 'series', 'Marilyn', 'Kaye', 'starting', 'Amy', 'Number', 'Seven']",Anna to the Infinite Power VHS

Cook,"[17, 18]","Is it just me, or is that lovely song &quot;Anna's Reverie&quot; (written by Paul Baillargeon) one of the most beautiful and sadly overlooked songs in film?  I've never heard anyone comment on it and it is truly haunting.  As for the film, it is full of terrific ideas and is not badly put together, but it is decidedly amateurish and marred by ugly production values that are quite dated.  Overall, the film is a perfect candidate for a remake, having good ideas but needing a more polished production to pull them off.  Byrne does a nice job in the title role, however, and the song makes it worth a look. . .",3,That &quot;Reverie&quot; Song steals the show. . .,1066780800,"10 22, 2003",2003,611,"['just', 'lovely', 'song', 'quot', 'Anna', 'Reverie', 'quot', 'written', 'Paul', 'Baillargeon', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'sadly', 'overlooked', 'songs', 'film', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'anyone', 'comment', 'truly', 'haunting', 'film', 'full', 'terrific', 'ideas', 'not', 'badly', 'put', 'together', 'decidedly', 'amateurish', 'marred', 'ugly', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'quite', 'dated', 'Overall', 'film', 'perfect', 'candidate', 'remake', 'having', 'good', 'ideas', 'needing', 'more', 'polished', 'production', 'pull', 'off', 'Byrne', 'nice', 'job', 'title', 'role', 'however', 'song', 'look']",Anna to the Infinite Power VHS

A spoiled, self-centered child changed by discipline and exposure to music, a self-centered brother who gives up (spoiler alert) the thing that matters to him most to help his sister who he once said he hated, thereby demonstrating true love.  A family torn apart by deception brought together by love and forgiveness.  An unexpected twist at the end.  A good old-fashioned story all around.  Very interesting old computers too.

I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so I'll just say that the plot has withstood the test of time--the ""events"" are still relevant and being written about in children's literature today.I would consider showing this to a classroom--5th grade and up.
