Had never seen her perform before but had heard about her all my life. Then, I saw some of her silent films which led me to read two biographies about her and, more importantly, the era in which she worked. It was very enlightening because I could clearly see how the industry developed and what happened to the art form when the decency codes were enacted. This video biography fills in many details that are only alluded to in the books. It is well made and I would advise seeing it after reading the Swenson biography, which was far superior to the other I read.",5,Interesting and educational,1208649600,"04 20, 2008",2008,639,"['First', 'saw', 'Garbo', 'Saga', 'Gosta', 'Berling', 'broadcast', 'television', 'Had', 'never', 'seen', 'perform', 'had', 'heard', 'life', 'Then', 'saw', 'silent', 'films', 'led', 'read', 'two', 'biographies', 'more', 'importantly', 'era', 'worked', 'was', 'very', 'enlightening', 'could', 'clearly', 'see', 'how', 'industry', 'developed', 'what', 'happened', 'art', 'form', 'when', 'decency', 'codes', 'were', 'enacted', 'video', 'biography', 'fills', 'many', 'details', 'are', 'only', 'alluded', 'books', 'well', 'made', 'would', 'advise', 'seeing', 'reading', 'Swenson', 'biography', 'was', 'far', 'superior', 'other', 'read']",Garbo [DVD]
984200,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000F76MFA,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","This is a very nice, concise documentary on the career of Greta Garbo.  It is mostly-dedicated to her work in films.  Those looking for a greater insight into Garbo's personal affairs will be sorely-disappointed, however there have been a great many documentaries that have been focused on her offscreen life (her private life is still the subject of intense scrutiny and often-unfounded conjecture).Warmly-narrated by Julie Christie, this 2005 TCM-produced documentary is of course littered with clips from Garbo's films, from her early silents to her 1941 swansong ""Two-Faced Woman"".  Those interviewed include longtime fan Charles Busch, biographer Karen Swenson, Leatrice Joy (the daughter of Garbo's frequent leading man John Gilbert), and childhood friend Mimi Pollak;  in addition to her relatives, Gray, Scott and Donald Reisfield (who are quick to dispel many myths surrounding the elusive star).Elusive is the word that best describes Garbo.  Why she became an actress in Hollywood in the first place is still a mystery in itself.  Why on earth would a fiercely-private young lady from Sweden become a ""cog"" in the public machine of movies is, I think, the biggest puzzle of them all.  Garbo created an image of unattainable beauty on the screen.  She came along at precisely the right time - and left, to the regret of her fans, much too soon.  But she was the captain of her own destiny.  There was a grain of incorruptible truth that Garbo held in her heart and refused to let go.  What remains is her glorious cannon of screen heroines... the tragic ""Anna Karenina"" and ""Camille""... hilarious ""Ninotchka""... resilient ""Anna Christie""... exotic ""Mata Hari""... and the list goes on.Garbo fans will definitely want to indulge in this.

984202,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B000F76MFA,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[4, 4]","Greta Garbo is a movie legend.  Swedish actress who made her way to America to find fame at very early age and retire when whe was only 36 years old.  She is a classical beauty that I always found to be a model of what woman should really look like: not a Barbie doll like, elegant and effortlessly dazzling.This biography covers her entire life, events that shaped her and perceptions of Garbo from people in the movie industry, her fans, paid companions and also family members.  In my humble opinion, she was greatly misunderstood.  Call it a culture shock of whatever, but she was typical European woman who found herself unprepared and alone in a foreign coutry surrounded with people not necessarily trustworthy.  The fact that until the end of her life in 1990 she preserved her independence in both personal life and he financial means gives her additional respect as a woman who no matter how perceived knoew how to take care of herself on her own.",5,Biography of the classic beauty and actress,1291593600,"12 6, 2010",2010,957,"['Greta', 'Garbo', 'movie', 'legend', 'Swedish', 'actress', 'who', 'made', 'way', 'America', 'find', 'fame', 'very', 'early', 'age', 'retire', 'when', 'whe', 'was', 'only', '36', 'years', 'old', 'classical', 'beauty', 'always', 'found', 'be', 'model', 'what', 'woman', 'should', 'really', 'look', 'not', 'Barbie', 'doll', 'elegant', 'effortlessly', 'dazzling.This', 'biography', 'entire', 'life', 'events', 'shaped', 'perceptions', 'Garbo', 'people', 'movie', 'industry', 'fans', 'paid', 'companions', 'also', 'family', 'members', 'humble', 'opinion', 'was', 'greatly', 'misunderstood', 'Call', 'culture', 'shock', 'whatever', 'was', 'typical', 'European', 'woman', 'who', 'found', 'unprepared', 'alone', 'foreign', 'coutry', 'surrounded', 'people', 'not', 'necessarily', 'trustworthy', 'fact', 'end', 'life', '1990', 'preserved', 'independence', 'personal', 'life', 'financial', 'additional', 'respect', 'woman', 'who', 'matter', 'how', 'perceived', 'knoew', 'how', 'take', 'care', 'herself', 'own']",Garbo [DVD]

A Swedish born actress who began in silent films, Garbo made quite a career into the talking era, but suddenly and without warning left stardom to a life away from the cameras.An entertaining and informative overview of Greta Garbo's career and life, this documentary is satisfactory for anyone with an interest in classic films. There are new interviews with friends, family, and biographers like Barry Paris and Karen Swenson, and vintage interviews culled from director Kevin Brownlow's Hollywood series with celebrities like Clarence Brown and Adela Rogers St. John. Garbo is a solid effort.It does not, however, provide anything new for fans. The information is rehashed from countless biographies and documentaries that came before it. Some information is missing, such as the famous almost-wedding of Garbo and John Gilbert. Only those films that are considered important are examined, so much of Garbo's work is skipped over. It would have been nice to have been presented with a more complete look into Garbo's career and life, especially considering Brownlow's past work and what he is capable of.",4,"Satisfactory, Far From Outstanding",1299369600,"03 6, 2011",2011,1169,"['Greta', 'Garbo', 'one', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'elusive', 'stars', 'Swedish', 'born', 'actress', 'who', 'began', 'silent', 'films', 'Garbo', 'made', 'quite', 'career', 'talking', 'era', 'suddenly', 'warning', 'left', 'stardom', 'life', 'away', 'cameras.An', 'entertaining', 'informative', 'overview', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'career', 'life', 'documentary', 'satisfactory', 'anyone', 'interest', 'classic', 'films', 'are', 'new', 'interviews', 'friends', 'family', 'biographers', 'Barry', 'Paris', 'Karen', 'Swenson', 'vintage', 'interviews', 'culled', 'director', 'Kevin', 'Brownlow', 'Hollywood', 'series', 'celebrities', 'Clarence', 'Brown', 'Adela', 'Rogers', 'St.', 'John', 'Garbo', 'solid', 'effort.It', 'not', 'however', 'provide', 'anything', 'new', 'fans', 'information', 'rehashed', 'countless', 'biographies', 'documentaries', 'came', 'information', 'missing', 'such', 'famous', 'almost-wedding', 'Garbo', 'John', 'Gilbert', 'Only', 'films', 'are', 'considered', 'important', 'are', 'examined', 'so', 'much', 'Garbo', 'work', 'skipped', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'been', 'presented', 'more', 'complete', 'look', 'Garbo', 'career', 'life', 'especially', 'considering', 'Brownlow', 'past', 'work', 'what', 'capable']",Garbo [DVD]
