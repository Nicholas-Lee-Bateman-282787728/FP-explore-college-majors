The first series of MI-5 purportedly takes us into the British internal (UK-centric) intelligence agency. The first series is gritty, surprisingly shocking in places, and mostly a good under-stated television drama with just enough character development that we can get attached to the personalities and just enough contravention of usual TV routine that we are sometimes shocked - at one point, very much so.So if you want to watch a gritty spy series, this is the one to go for. But don't get too excited - after the first series, MI-5 became increasingly formulaic and silly as the stakes had to get higher and higher and the various characters began to come and go as if the ""pods"" into ""the grid"" had turned into a revolving door.",4,Good First Series,1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,875,"['watch', 'TV', 'shows', 'entertainment', 'also', 'enjoy', 'having', 'glimpses', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'different', 'worlds', 'different', 'lives', 'first', 'series', 'MI-5', 'purportedly', 'British', 'internal', 'UK-centric', 'intelligence', 'agency', 'first', 'series', 'gritty', 'surprisingly', 'shocking', 'places', 'mostly', 'good', 'under-stated', 'television', 'drama', 'just', 'enough', 'character', 'development', 'can', 'get', 'attached', 'personalities', 'just', 'enough', 'contravention', 'usual', 'TV', 'routine', 'are', 'sometimes', 'shocked', 'one', 'point', 'very', 'much', 'so.So', 'want', 'watch', 'gritty', 'spy', 'series', 'one', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'excited', 'first', 'series', 'MI-5', 'became', 'increasingly', 'formulaic', 'silly', 'stakes', 'had', 'get', 'higher', 'higher', 'various', 'characters', 'began', 'come', 'go', 'pods', 'grid', 'had', 'turned', 'revolving', 'door']","MI-5, Vol. 1"
780941,AMIGVTZZIWS6I,B0000E32UZ,Amazon Customer,"[35, 37]","I first became addicted to this show, known as Spooks in the UK, when it first appeared on A&E.  MI-5 is an example of television at its finest.  This show gives us a fictional insider view of Britian's domestic intelligence division known as MI-5, and we're not talking James Bond (anyway, he was MI-6).  This show presents these people as patriots fighting to keep their country safe, but it's also not afraid to present the morally questionable side, as well -- not something you usually see on American television.  In the US, when a show like this is made it treats the players as heroes making a great sacrifice to keep the country safe, rarely as human beings who sometimes have to make morally questionable decisions, decisions that force them to question whether they are doing the right thing or not.  Shows like Alias and 24 come close, but they are more thriller shows with thriller plots and violence.  This show works in real-time, often using real-time events as catalyst for their plots.  What sets this show apart from the likes of Alias and 24 is the human factor:  the series focuses more on the human drama than it does the thriller elements.  Matthew MacFadyen is absolutely wonderful as Tom Quinn, who over time begins to wonder about the decisions he's had to make and the affect they've had on his life and those around him. Keeley Hawes as Zoe Reynolds, David Oyelowo as Danny Hunter, and Peter Firth as Harry Pearce are exceptional supporting players.  Don't let the British setting keep you from watching this series.  Unlike any show currently on television in America, based in America, this series reminds us there is still a war on terror and we're only moments away from another disaster.

It's a shame we have to wait so long for the seasons to make its way across the pond. I've seen S1-4 so far and a few things surprise me with this show. There's an incredible rate of turnover of main characters, something that's risky for the show to do and sometimes drive me crazy. Luckily they manage to toss in such interesting newcomers that I stay glued. S2 and S3 are my favorites so far. S2 because that's when the original cast hits their stride. S3 because of the jaw-dropping twists that get thrown including one of the best season-finale. The best part for me is not the glitzy cases, but the drama that churn around the characters, the way they wrestle with the demands of the job, the lack of real identity and the effects on their relationships. The cast is so top-notch, with Tom, Harry and Ruth being my favorites to watch. The worst part is the long wait time for the seasons to get to the US. If the BBC would offer it online for us, I'd gladly pay to get S7 in real time! Either way, rent or buy the dvds. It's the best way to watch as they don't edit anything out, and you get a solid 60MIN per episode without commercials. A pleasant bonus is the amount of extras they include on the Season 1-3 sets.

There is a scene in the 2nd episode that became one of the most controversial scenes in British television history, and with good reason.  It is a visceral, indellible shocker that makes you want to reach for the antacid.  If you can stomach it, the show is exciting, smart and engaging.  The real problem - as someone already pointed out in another review - is the DVD menu.  You almost have to be a Spook to figure out how to traverse the complicated menu universe you enter in MI-5.  I was apparently too stupid to figure it all out the first few times because I ended up starting the 1st episode over and over until I finally figured out that I was in the wrong 'dosier'.  Dumb me.

He also has a high level government official in his pocket.  He has a beautiful young wife who he beats.MI-5 is aware of the problem through their intelligence gathering; MI-5 assimilates into the racist's family, but the racist finds out they are spys.  First he kills a newspaper reporter who is gathering information undercover.  Then two of the MI-5 spooks are captured by the racist.  The MI-5 operative is told if he does not provide information, he will stick the young woman's hand in boiling oil, which he does.  As the operative hedges again, her face is pushed into the boiling oil until she is killed.The male operative was able to escape.  The wife was able to work with MI-5 to pull her husband down.

Though I love the program, its value is more profound - to me, anyway - via the street-angle view of London at its best (of course) and a generous peek into the Brits' opinion of us (seriously challenged and ignorant) Yanks. They just don't like us a bit - at least, most certainly not in this series - I wager, an accurate depiction of their &#34;take&#34; on us dullards. All Americans are portrayed as beefy, brutish, overtly cunning, loud-mouthed jerks, better suited to a wrestling mat or used-cat lot, with blonde bombshell cheerleader-type females somehow playing the honeypot angle...regardless the character's position in the spy game or political arena. Legendary fun though, the characters are rich and dynamic, each (British) one generously &#34;fleshed out,&#34; giving the viewer a unique perspective when watching this series, uncommon to the genre.

780955,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B0000E32UZ,D. Mok,"[61, 63]","When I played the first episode of MI-5, Volume 1, my heart sank farther and farther over the course of the next hour.  The cinematography was weirdly cheery, the villains were completely without menace, and the main characters were confusing, vaguely characterized, and seem a little too young for the genre of the show.  After this episode, I was already thinking about how much I'd fetch when I send this DVD set to a second-hand bin.But as Episode 2 rolled along, it's like the show woke up from slumber and began to gallop.The comparisons to 24 are a little convenient -- two espionage shows on two sides of the Atlantic, both surfacing around the crucial year of 2001?  But if you go into MI-5 expecting the ferocious action, ruthless characters, endless treacheries and gritty camera work of 24, you'd probably be a little disappointed.  MI-5 doesn't quite have the gut punch of 24 -- few shows do -- but what it does have is a very good cast, unusual plotting, a quirky sense of humour, and an eye for detail for the minutiae of life in espionage.  Also, because it's not bound to the real-time and L.A.-centric conceits of 24, MI-5 is actually broader in scope, dealing with Irish terrorists, Islam, race-motivated hate crimes, and European anarchists all within the first six episodes collected here.While I was initially skeptical of how babyfaced the actors looked, they prove to be very fine performers.  According to the supplementary materials on the DVDs, half of the members of MI-5 in real life are under the age of 40, so in that respect, the casting would make sense.  Matthew MacFadyen, despite his soft eyes and boyish good looks, can deliver intensity and resilience which convince us he could really be the second-in-command of this section of MI-5, Keeley Hawes drips with doe-eyed beauty and great comic timing, and David Oyelowo mixes mischief and determination nicely.  The crowning member of the cast is Peter Firth as Harry Pearce, the inscrutable leader of the group; he conveys both the steely core of the character and the humanity.I can't fathom why the pilot, with its weak, incoherent plot involving an anti-abortion terrorist with no sense of menace, was so unengaging.  But aside from this one dud, the other five episodes are in fine, engaging form.  MI-5 has its share of nail-biting scenes, the most powerful of which is the infamous Episode 2 ending, which was so harrowingly intense that it probably trumps any shock scene ever delivered by 24 -- no small feat indeed.  After that it's a fabulous ride, culminating in an Episode Six with a thrillingly broad scope, brisk pacing, and another very satisfying suspense sequence as the final course.  And throughout the episodes, the writers keep a keen eye towards the fascinating details of life as a ""spook"", an added layer of fascination which gives the show a unique character and brings us closer to what it's like being an MI-5 agent.Aside from the unsatisfying pilot, there are just a few minor gripes:  The DVD design went nuts trying to be creative, but ends up with a design that's awkward to navigate as well as buggy -- several buttons on the menu froze up my DVD player, and none of the main-menu items are marked.  Please, next time, don't sacrifice convenient access for style.  They made a great effort to include lots of bonus materials, but the cast/crew interviews are shallow and sluggish in pace (more editing please), making all the actors seem sleepy and unfocused.  And since this set is only six episodes long, the overall arc of the episodes will seem a lot less satisfying than a full-on season.  However, these shows remain a great introduction to a show that carries all the thrills of the espionage genre, while giving it a unique spin.",5,A shaky pilot gives way to excellent acting and intriguing stories.,1123977600,"08 14, 2005",2005,3756,"['When', 'played', 'first', 'episode', 'MI-5', 'Volume', '1', 'heart', 'sank', 'farther', 'farther', 'course', 'next', 'hour', 'cinematography', 'was', 'weirdly', 'cheery', 'villains', 'were', 'completely', 'menace', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'confusing', 'vaguely', 'characterized', 'seem', 'little', 'too', 'young', 'genre', 'show', 'episode', 'was', 'already', 'thinking', 'how', 'much', ""'d"", 'fetch', 'when', 'send', 'DVD', 'set', 'second-hand', 'bin.But', 'Episode', '2', 'rolled', 'along', 'show', 'woke', 'up', 'slumber', 'began', 'gallop.The', 'comparisons', '24', 'are', 'little', 'convenient', 'two', 'espionage', 'shows', 'two', 'sides', 'Atlantic', 'surfacing', 'crucial', 'year', '2001', 'go', 'MI-5', 'expecting', 'ferocious', 'action', 'ruthless', 'characters', 'endless', 'treacheries', 'gritty', 'camera', 'work', '24', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'little', 'disappointed', 'MI-5', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'gut', 'punch', '24', 'few', 'shows', 'do', 'what', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'cast', 'unusual', 'plotting', 'quirky', 'sense', 'humour', 'eye', 'detail', 'minutiae', 'life', 'espionage', 'Also', 'not', 'bound', 'real-time', 'L.A.-centric', 'conceits', '24', 'MI-5', 'actually', 'broader', 'scope', 'dealing', 'Irish', 'terrorists', 'Islam', 'race-motivated', 'hate', 'crimes', 'European', 'anarchists', 'first', 'six', 'episodes', 'collected', 'here.While', 'was', 'initially', 'skeptical', 'how', 'babyfaced', 'actors', 'looked', 'prove', 'be', 'very', 'fine', 'performers', 'According', 'supplementary', 'materials', 'DVDs', 'half', 'members', 'MI-5', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'age', '40', 'so', 'respect', 'casting', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'Matthew', 'MacFadyen', 'soft', 'eyes', 'boyish', 'good', 'looks', 'can', 'deliver', 'intensity', 'resilience', 'convince', 'could', 'really', 'be', 'second-in-command', 'section', 'MI-5', 'Keeley', 'Hawes', 'doe-eyed', 'beauty', 'great', 'comic', 'timing', 'David', 'Oyelowo', 'mixes', 'mischief', 'determination', 'nicely', 'crowning', 'member', 'cast', 'Peter', 'Firth', 'Harry', 'Pearce', 'inscrutable', 'leader', 'group', 'steely', 'core', 'character', 'humanity.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fathom', 'why', 'pilot', 'weak', 'incoherent', 'plot', 'involving', 'anti-abortion', 'terrorist', 'sense', 'menace', 'was', 'so', 'unengaging', 'aside', 'one', 'dud', 'other', 'five', 'episodes', 'are', 'fine', 'engaging', 'form', 'MI-5', 'share', 'nail-biting', 'scenes', 'most', 'powerful', 'infamous', 'Episode', '2', 'ending', 'was', 'so', 'harrowingly', 'intense', 'probably', 'shock', 'scene', 'ever', 'delivered', '24', 'small', 'feat', 'indeed', 'fabulous', 'ride', 'culminating', 'Episode', 'Six', 'thrillingly', 'broad', 'scope', 'brisk', 'pacing', 'very', 'satisfying', 'suspense', 'sequence', 'final', 'course', 'episodes', 'writers', 'keep', 'keen', 'eye', 'fascinating', 'details', 'life', 'spook', 'added', 'layer', 'fascination', 'show', 'unique', 'character', 'closer', 'what', 'being', 'MI-5', 'agent.Aside', 'unsatisfying', 'pilot', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'minor', 'gripes', 'DVD', 'design', 'went', 'nuts', 'trying', 'be', 'creative', 'up', 'design', 'awkward', 'navigate', 'as', 'well', 'buggy', 'several', 'buttons', 'menu', 'froze', 'up', 'DVD', 'player', 'none', 'main-menu', 'items', 'are', 'marked', 'Please', 'next', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'sacrifice', 'convenient', 'access', 'style', 'made', 'great', 'effort', 'include', 'lots', 'bonus', 'materials', 'cast/crew', 'interviews', 'are', 'shallow', 'sluggish', 'pace', 'more', 'editing', 'please', 'making', 'actors', 'seem', 'sleepy', 'unfocused', 'set', 'only', 'six', 'episodes', 'long', 'overall', 'arc', 'episodes', 'will', 'seem', 'lot', 'less', 'satisfying', 'full-on', 'season', 'However', 'shows', 'remain', 'great', 'introduction', 'show', 'thrills', 'espionage', 'genre', 'giving', 'unique', 'spin']","MI-5, Vol. 1"

Anderson,"[3, 9]","I'm giving this 3 stars.Only six episodes in the first season, so it is definitely no bargain to purchase.The production values do not meet the standard of Alias or other American spy shows.As for the plots, they are very good. MI-5 is a more realistic series than Alias, but it seems constrained by comparison. In Alias, the characters are always jetting off to some exotic locale, James Bond-style. The spooks in MI-5 are often limited to the drudgery of computer searches, stakeouts, and trying to blend in to the scenery as they tail suspects or liase with fellow spies or CIA agents. And they stay in jolly old England.I have a problem with the season one villains. They seem a little trite, a little too one-dimensional. This improved greatly in season two.The team of MI-5 characters and the actors who play them are very likeable. We get to know the personal side, the motivations, and some of the strengths and weaknesses of Tom Quinn, Zoe, and Danny -- the spooks who form the core of the MI-5 series. This team is a great foundation for a recurring series of adventures, and the actors grow in confidence and believability in season two.Season one is an above-average television spy show. I don't think the series really comes into its own until season two, where the personal dramas of the MI-5 team and the enemies they are fighting become more gripping. I think visually - in terms of cinematography - season two is an improvement as well.

This show follows the exploits of Section B of MI-5, the British equivalent of the CIA, as they battle terrorists of all shapes and forms. What elevates this show above its American brethren is its refusal to sugarcoat the storylines. Characters, even the regulars, betray each other, crack under pressure, succumb to temptation, struggle with difficult decisions, and make ruthless choices that we imagine are necessary in the real world of espionage. Happy endings are neither required nor welcome.There are only six episodes over 3 DVDs in this box set of Season 1, but what a 6 episodes they are. I never saw the edited versions that aired on A&amp;E in the US (10 minutes were cut from each episode), but fortunately these DVDs contain the uncut versions of all 6 episodes. I'm hooked and dying for Season 2 to arrive on DVD (it will include the next 10 episodes). The last episode, in particular, will blow your mind with its ending.Alias, with its romanticized storylines, is spycraft-light compared to MI-5 which recalls for me the addictive pace of 24 in its first two seasons, before it descended into recursive silliness. I have just two complaints. One is the convoluted DVD menu which simulates a spy breaking into a computer room. It takes forever for the actual DVD menu options to come up, and after you've been through it once you'll wish you could bypass it and just get to the programs.

They have to save Britain from security threats from within the country and from abroad. There is never a quiet moment at MI-5. A friend recommended this series and raved about how fascinating and rivoting it was. I found the pilot rather uninspired. This time the threat is from an American named Mary Kay. If she has snuck into the UK and is planning a terror seize and the MI-5 knows her whereabouts, why not just arrest her?The theme behind this series is the need to always get hard evidence before making a move even if that puts more lives in jeopardy. It isn't easy being a spy and one aspect of series one that is fascinating is how does a spy have a personal life? Is it possible? Master spy Tom Quinn has fallen in love and how does he explain to his lady and her little daughter about the late night calls and mysterious meetings? Realtions within the group are not easy, too, as they try to outspy each other and come out on top.MI-5 does have a modernistic feel and a vibrant look to the series. I found the DVD setup to be the most annoying. I didn't realize what was happening at first as this masked spy enters an office and is instructed to go to the CD rack or the phone.

The episodes are deftly written and well-acted, truly unlike anything else currently airing.  The tone is sometimes moody and a bit hectic, but that is the point of the series; these are British Intelligence agents working on matters of high security, from the attempted hack-in of the bankroll from which MI-5 pays their agents (undercover and otherwise) to Alexander Siddig's role as an Algerian defector seeking to infiltrate a sect of Muslim extremists.The plots are fast-paced and the characterization is well-thought out and plotted; Tom McFayden's Quinn wrestles with a dual identity: he is trying to maintain a relationship while keeping his girlfriend Ellie in the dark.  One of the more emotionally telling moments of the first season is when Quinn suffers an injury and is forced to come clean with Ellie about his dangerous line of work.This is one of the most original, suspenseful, and character-driven series' to come down the pipe in ages.

Don't make the mistake I almost made and discontinue this series after scrutinizing the first couple of episodes. If you're not totally enthralled mid-2nd Season, don't bother continuing.MI-5 might very well be one of the best written, best edited, most intriguing series that I've ever watched. Sorry to all the ""24"" fans, but MI-5 is ten-fold superior and the plot and storylines make a mockery of writers of ""24"". (Yes, I enjoyed ""24"")Case in point (regarding the majority of US Series);US series-same actors/heroes will never die because producers need them back to carry on the series (unrealistic)- US series (minus advertisements) are usually around 20 to 36 minutes.-bad guys always lose (unrealistic)-actors appear to all be Clooney or Alba clones (unrealistic)-character development is not generally a strong suite for so many US series writers due to budget and production time-tables.BBC Series-No one actor is bigger than the series itself. Anyone is capable of being removed by death, captured, corruption, torture, traumatized or even completely wrong in decision making. This creates realistic appeal and what makes this MI-5 so darn believable.- each episode is approximately 50 to 60 minutes- Bad guys and bad countries win often, just like in real life- actors are uniformly qualified as US actors (debatably even more-so), but all actors appeal to look like average people we all know and work with, no glitz pure acting-plot, character development, and mystery are, and have been, a strong suite for the British for quite sometime now.This is, as stated, by so many others, a edgy, dark, thinking person's series not a special effects, wild-west exploding shoot-out series.Get through, don't skip, Season One because MI-5 only continues to out-do itself with each passing season....the only three negatives regarding MI-5 are 1) the DVD menus (which has been stated) are tedious to graft but improve with each passing season, 2) MI-5 is the most addictive series I've ever watched (including Lost, 24, Dexter, The Sopranos, West Wing, True Blood, etc.), 3) I just purchased Season 10 (2/27/12) and this is MI-5's final season!",5,A Look Back for the Buyer Looking Forward...,1330300800,"02 27, 2012",2012,2382,"['Thought', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', 'share', 'thoughts', 'Season', 'one', 'MI-5', 'slide', 'watching', 'Season', 'Seven.For', 'MI-5', 'newbie', 'Season', '1', 'only', 'slightly', 'above', 'average', 'yes', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'worthy', '5', 'stars', 'Do', ""n't"", 'make', 'mistake', 'almost', 'made', 'discontinue', 'series', 'scrutinizing', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'not', 'totally', 'enthralled', 'mid-2nd', 'Season', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'continuing.MI-5', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'written', 'best', 'edited', 'most', 'intriguing', 'series', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'Sorry', 'all', '24', 'fans', 'MI-5', 'ten-fold', 'superior', 'plot', 'storylines', 'make', 'mockery', 'writers', '24', 'Yes', 'enjoyed', '24', 'Case', 'point', 'regarding', 'majority', 'US', 'Series', 'US', 'series-same', 'actors/heroes', 'will', 'never', 'die', 'producers', 'need', 'back', 'carry', 'series', 'unrealistic', 'US', 'series', 'advertisements', 'are', 'usually', 'around', '20', '36', 'minutes.-bad', 'guys', 'always', 'lose', 'unrealistic', '-actors', 'appear', 'be', 'Clooney', 'Alba', 'clones', 'unrealistic', '-character', 'development', 'not', 'generally', 'strong', 'suite', 'so', 'many', 'US', 'series', 'writers', 'due', 'budget', 'production', 'time-tables.BBC', 'Series-No', 'one', 'actor', 'bigger', 'series', 'Anyone', 'capable', 'being', 'removed', 'death', 'captured', 'corruption', 'torture', 'traumatized', 'even', 'completely', 'wrong', 'decision', 'making', 'realistic', 'appeal', 'what', 'MI-5', 'darn', 'believable.-', 'episode', 'approximately', '50', '60', 'minutes-', 'Bad', 'guys', 'bad', 'countries', 'win', 'often', 'just', 'real', 'life-', 'actors', 'are', 'uniformly', 'qualified', 'US', 'actors', 'debatably', 'even', 'more-so', 'actors', 'appeal', 'look', 'average', 'people', 'know', 'work', 'glitz', 'pure', 'acting-plot', 'character', 'development', 'mystery', 'are', 'have', 'been', 'strong', 'suite', 'British', 'quite', 'sometime', 'now.This', 'stated', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'edgy', 'dark', 'thinking', 'person', 'series', 'not', 'special', 'effects', 'wild-west', 'exploding', 'shoot-out', 'series.Get', 'do', ""n't"", 'skip', 'Season', 'One', 'MI-5', 'only', 'out-do', 'passing', 'season', 'only', 'three', 'negatives', 'regarding', 'MI-5', 'are', '1', 'DVD', 'menus', 'been', 'stated', 'are', 'tedious', 'graft', 'improve', 'passing', 'season', '2', 'MI-5', 'most', 'addictive', 'series', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'including', 'Lost', '24', 'Dexter', 'Sopranos', 'West', 'Wing', 'True', 'Blood', 'etc', '3', 'just', 'purchased', 'Season', '10', '2/27/12', 'MI-5', 'final', 'season']","MI-5, Vol. 1"

I quickly realized that most of the bad-guys were products of the fevered British ""progressive"" imagination: a U.S. fundamentalist Christian woman (who violently fights abortion, in Britain [yep, that one happens a lot, there are a lot of those wandering the streets of the UK], a right-wing racist, etc. It became really predictable. I was waiting for the ""neo-conservative"" to make his appearance. I also didn't like the way the characters came out and said things like ""I know what I am saying is cynical power politics, but that is just how things work"". In one scene at MI5, a cabinet-level politician says that, basically. Come on ! Politicians justify their behavior better than that. I also don't think it is necessary to show the the MI5 agents ""have home lives"". What is the point ? What, did we think otherwise that they spent all their time in the MI5 building ?

780975,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B0000E32UZ,Joseph Haschka,"[137, 141]","There've been some uncommonly intelligent spy films produced by British television: TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY and SMILEY'S PEOPLE (both starring Sir Alec Guinness as the owlish George Smiley), and THE SANDBAGGERS miniseries. In all three, the agency involved is Her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service (MI-6). The operatives are a tweedy lot, and the headquarters, either at the old ""Circus"" or the more modern Century House, are, like the remains of Empire, comfortably shabby. Thus, it was with some misgivings that I began MI-5, the ongoing glitzy miniseries featuring the SIS's less glamorous sister also known as the Security Service, which like America's FBI, deals with domestic intelligence, anti-subversion and counter-terrorism. The glitz is of Hollywood proportions - almost, for me, an instant turn-off. I'm glad I stuck with it.The lead ""spook"" is Tom Quinn, played by Matthew MacFadyen. He runs an undercover operations team, the most prominent members of which are Zoe Reynolds (Keeley Hawes) and Danny Hunter (David Oyelowo). The interior of MI-5's London HQ, Thames House, is ultramodern and high tech; the CIA probably never had it so good. Tom's boss is the hardboiled and sphinx-like Harry Pearce, played by Peter Firth.Admittedly, I didn't become engaged until episodes three and four, when I realized that the intricate scripts, fast-paced and tautly presented, transcended the glitz. I'm now hooked, and eagerly await the DVD release of the Season 2 episodes in late 2004. My only remaining complaint is the too clever lead-in to each episode which requires excessive button-pushing on the remote to navigate. I mean, just get on with it. Prince Charles will become King in a shorter time.The storylines are contemporary: embassy take-overs by militant nationalists, insidious plots by Arab terrorists, illegal arms deals by enterprising Russians involving Whitehall cabinet officers, and the occasional appearance of IRA bombers. Gone are the good old days of KGB machinations on behalf of the Evil Empire. The episodes are slickly written with surprising plot twists. And MI-6 across the river maintains a scheming and patronizing presence.Part of the show's attraction is that it doesn't paint its MI-5 heroes as perfect. They have relationship problems; they embezzle money from the Service; and perhaps have dark secrets in the past that invite blackmail during intra-office power struggles. Why, it sounds like any company I've ever worked for!The end of the last episode in Series 1 is one of the best I've ever seen. It'll make you think twice before installing that elaborate security system on your house, or at least make you aware of the dangers posed by a small child when catalyzed by chocolate icing.",4,Transcending the glitz,1092355200,"08 13, 2004",2004,2743,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'uncommonly', 'intelligent', 'spy', 'films', 'produced', 'British', 'television', 'TINKER', 'TAILOR', 'SOLDIER', 'SPY', 'SMILEY', 'PEOPLE', 'starring', 'Sir', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'owlish', 'George', 'Smiley', 'THE', 'SANDBAGGERS', 'miniseries', 'three', 'agency', 'involved', 'Majesty', 'Secret', 'Intelligence', 'Service', 'MI-6', 'operatives', 'are', 'tweedy', 'lot', 'headquarters', 'old', 'Circus', 'more', 'modern', 'Century', 'House', 'are', 'remains', 'Empire', 'comfortably', 'shabby', 'Thus', 'was', 'misgivings', 'began', 'MI-5', 'ongoing', 'glitzy', 'miniseries', 'featuring', 'SIS', 'less', 'glamorous', 'sister', 'also', 'known', 'Security', 'Service', 'America', 'FBI', 'domestic', 'intelligence', 'anti-subversion', 'counter-terrorism', 'glitz', 'Hollywood', 'proportions', 'almost', 'instant', 'turn-off', ""'m"", 'glad', 'stuck', 'it.The', 'lead', 'spook', 'Tom', 'Quinn', 'played', 'Matthew', 'MacFadyen', 'undercover', 'operations', 'team', 'most', 'prominent', 'members', 'are', 'Zoe', 'Reynolds', 'Keeley', 'Hawes', 'Danny', 'Hunter', 'David', 'Oyelowo', 'interior', 'MI-5', 'London', 'HQ', 'Thames', 'House', 'ultramodern', 'high', 'tech', 'CIA', 'probably', 'never', 'had', 'so', 'good', 'Tom', 'boss', 'hardboiled', 'sphinx-like', 'Harry', 'Pearce', 'played', 'Peter', 'Firth.Admittedly', 'did', ""n't"", 'become', 'engaged', 'episodes', 'three', 'four', 'when', 'realized', 'intricate', 'scripts', 'fast-paced', 'tautly', 'presented', 'transcended', 'glitz', ""'m"", 'now', 'hooked', 'eagerly', 'await', 'DVD', 'release', 'Season', '2', 'episodes', 'late', '2004', 'only', 'remaining', 'complaint', 'too', 'clever', 'lead-in', 'episode', 'excessive', 'button-pushing', 'remote', 'navigate', 'mean', 'just', 'get', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'will', 'become', 'King', 'shorter', 'time.The', 'storylines', 'are', 'contemporary', 'embassy', 'take-overs', 'militant', 'nationalists', 'insidious', 'plots', 'Arab', 'terrorists', 'illegal', 'arms', 'deals', 'enterprising', 'Russians', 'involving', 'Whitehall', 'cabinet', 'officers', 'occasional', 'appearance', 'IRA', 'bombers', 'Gone', 'are', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'KGB', 'machinations', 'behalf', 'Evil', 'Empire', 'episodes', 'are', 'slickly', 'written', 'surprising', 'plot', 'twists', 'MI-6', 'river', 'scheming', 'patronizing', 'presence.Part', 'show', 'attraction', ""n't"", 'paint', 'MI-5', 'heroes', 'perfect', 'have', 'relationship', 'problems', 'embezzle', 'money', 'Service', 'perhaps', 'have', 'dark', 'secrets', 'past', 'invite', 'blackmail', 'intra-office', 'power', 'struggles', 'Why', 'company', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'worked', 'end', 'last', 'episode', 'Series', '1', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'ll"", 'make', 'think', 'twice', 'before', 'installing', 'elaborate', 'security', 'system', 'house', 'least', 'make', 'aware', 'dangers', 'posed', 'small', 'child', 'when', 'catalyzed', 'chocolate', 'icing']","MI-5, Vol. 1"

I am mid way through series 4 and I would rate the series on a whole to be very good-excellent.*It may take an episode or 2 to become accustomed to the accentsLikes:The vast majority of the plot lines are tightly woven and rely more on independent/group thought and less on physical action.  As a matter of course being that most of the hard core action is farmed out to SAS units (unlike many American series where the deep thinkers are also martial arts experts and crack shots). The main characters all have flaws.  Unfortunately, Hugh Laurie, as head of MI-6 (think CIA to the MI-5/FBI) is only with us for 1-series.  His comic wit is a precursor of what is to become ""House.""Dislikes:There are some uneven plot lines, which I suppose is the case with many series bar the absolute best.  New characters are brought into the series while others fall off at a greater rate than is typical with American ""hit"" series.  There may very well be a point to this, however, IMHO, this makes for some of the uneven plot lines, though it could simply come down to personal preferences in getting involved with a character(s) over a course of several seasons.All in, I would rate the series as a must watch and would reiterate my prior advice re: purchasing a region free DVD player and checking out some of the great series on Amazon UK",4,AKA Spooks is Worth the Investment!,1230595200,"12 30, 2008",2008,1669,"['Having', 'region', 'free', 'DVD', 'player', 'must', 'have', 'good', 'volume', 'TV', 'series', 'coming', 'pond', 'purchased', 'series', '1-5', 'original', 'title', 'Spooks', 'package', 'offer', 'Amazon', 'UK', 'FYI', 'much', 'less', 'costly', 'alternative', 'even', 'shipping', 'USA', '.I', 'debated', 'give', 'series', '4-stars', '5', 'am', 'mid', 'way', 'series', '4', 'would', 'rate', 'series', 'whole', 'be', 'very', 'good-excellent', '*It', 'may', 'take', 'episode', '2', 'become', 'accustomed', 'accentsLikes', 'vast', 'majority', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'tightly', 'woven', 'rely', 'more', 'independent/group', 'thought', 'less', 'physical', 'action', 'matter', 'course', 'being', 'most', 'hard', 'core', 'action', 'farmed', 'SAS', 'units', 'many', 'American', 'series', 'where', 'deep', 'thinkers', 'are', 'also', 'martial', 'arts', 'experts', 'crack', 'shots', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'flaws', 'Unfortunately', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'head', 'MI-6', 'think', 'CIA', 'MI-5/FBI', 'only', '1-series', 'comic', 'wit', 'precursor', 'what', 'become', 'House', 'Dislikes', 'are', 'uneven', 'plot', 'lines', 'suppose', 'case', 'many', 'series', 'bar', 'absolute', 'best', 'New', 'characters', 'are', 'brought', 'series', 'others', 'fall', 'off', 'greater', 'rate', 'typical', 'American', 'hit', 'series', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'point', 'however', 'IMHO', 'uneven', 'plot', 'lines', 'could', 'simply', 'come', 'down', 'personal', 'preferences', 'getting', 'involved', 'character', 's', 'course', 'several', 'seasons.All', 'would', 'rate', 'series', 'must', 'watch', 'would', 'reiterate', 'prior', 'advice', 're', 'purchasing', 'region', 'free', 'DVD', 'player', 'checking', 'out', 'great', 'series', 'Amazon', 'UK']","MI-5, Vol. 1"

Whether or not it is a realistic view is, of course, irrelevant...it makes for very good television!!

The episodes can progress at breakneck speed, and have a dark component that murder-mystery lovers will enjoy.  Be warned, however--this series isn't for the faint of heart.  Grisly death is part of being a spy, and ""MI-5"" pulls no punches in this regard.

As portrayed in this series, it&#8217;s a John Le Carr&eacute; universe on steroids and cocaine: the bad guys are really bad and really devious; the high-tech surveillance capabilities are impressive; the pace is fast; and almost no one is who he or she seems to be. The cast is strong and not chiseled in stone (few key characters survive all ten seasons); the early stories are interesting and relatively plausible; I was pulled in for the first few seasons.

780994,A1D20IFNA9432G,B0000E32UZ,PJ SanDiego,"[2, 7]","Normally, I love anything British.  After all, they certainly have the corner on spy thrillers.  However, MI-5 is to James Bond what TJ Hooker is to Prime Suspect.  The main issue I have is that the producers obviously think that their audience is unsophisticated and ignorant as to how the world really works.  Their aim is to provide the audience with nauseating ""teachable moments""  about how people should behave when dealing with terrorists and other sordid baddies.  At times I felt that I was being spoon fed what I should think instead of being shown reality and deciding for myself.  The problem is that when you expect your audience to ""just accept"" things without examination, your plot can quickly become absurd instead of poignant.  Here's some examples.Step 1) When faced with a hostage crisis, forget about tactical assault. That's too violent.  Just spend almost the entire episode installing listing and snooping devices.  Accompany the scene with intense music so that the audience thinks you are actually working toward resolving the issue instead of just delaying the ordeal and costing more lives.  For example, in one episode, a hostage strapped to a bomb almost dies of an ASTHMA attack because he has waited so long to be rescued.  Luckily they can hear him wheezing through the microphone they have secretly inserted into the villain's liar.  Thank goodness. Now we actually have reason to get inside the building...That man needs his meds!Step 2) Seize your opportunity to climb the spy ranks by volunteering for a high-risk assignment and then make a pass at your senior partner because ""you can't bear to be alone"" after you realize how dangerous the job really is.  The next day, get your face pushed into a deep fat fryer by the bad guy so that your senior partner feels guilty that he didn't sleep with you to comfort you. Now you are dead.  We will skip the part where you were completely unqualified to be in MI-5 and instead concentrate on the sad partner..Who is really cute...and now very sad.  Cue the sad music.Step 3) Don't tell your live-in girlfriend that you are really a spy because your last girlfriend spilled the beans to all her friends and put your life in danger and you had to dump her because of it.  But, when you finally do ""come out"" DO TELL her 5 year old daughter the whole sordid story...She won't EVER tell her friends and you will score points with mom.  Who, by the way, was perfectly okay shacking up with you-with her small child - not really knowing who you were. But, she is now OUTRAGED when she learns you are a spy for the government. Is there nothing worse? The writers expect us to feel her pain?Lastly, portray a complete stereotype about Americans by making the anti-abortion bomber a woman from the Ozarks.  When you catch her, leverage your interrogation power by not offering to extradite her to Florida...You know...where they actually execute people?  Oh gads...Not the electric chair!  Let's not dwell on her grizzly crime.  Instead, let's focus on how we feel about America's death penalty.  Your audience will never realize that she would actually be tried at the federal level as a terrorist and it wouldn't matter what state she was shipped to.  Then when you extradite her, have your ""Yank"" cohorts with sinister glee inform her on the way to the airport that-despite her cooperation- she's actually going to Orlando to ""see Micky"" after all....So sinister those Yanks.This show could be great...I wish it had been written for grown ups.",2,Condescending Pabulum...,1373241600,"07 8, 2013",2013,3519,"['Normally', 'love', 'anything', 'British', 'certainly', 'have', 'corner', 'spy', 'thrillers', 'However', 'MI-5', 'James', 'Bond', 'what', 'TJ', 'Hooker', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'main', 'issue', 'have', 'producers', 'obviously', 'think', 'audience', 'unsophisticated', 'ignorant', 'how', 'world', 'really', 'aim', 'provide', 'audience', 'nauseating', 'teachable', 'moments', 'how', 'people', 'should', 'behave', 'when', 'dealing', 'terrorists', 'other', 'sordid', 'baddies', 'times', 'felt', 'was', 'being', 'spoon', 'fed', 'what', 'should', 'think', 'instead', 'being', 'shown', 'reality', 'deciding', 'problem', 'when', 'expect', 'audience', 'just', 'accept', 'things', 'examination', 'plot', 'can', 'quickly', 'become', 'absurd', 'instead', 'poignant', 'Here', 'examples.Step', '1', 'When', 'faced', 'hostage', 'crisis', 'forget', 'tactical', 'assault', 'too', 'violent', 'Just', 'spend', 'almost', 'entire', 'episode', 'installing', 'listing', 'snooping', 'devices', 'scene', 'intense', 'music', 'audience', 'are', 'actually', 'working', 'resolving', 'issue', 'instead', 'just', 'delaying', 'ordeal', 'costing', 'more', 'lives', 'example', 'one', 'episode', 'hostage', 'strapped', 'bomb', 'almost', 'dies', 'ASTHMA', 'attack', 'waited', 'so', 'long', 'be', 'rescued', 'Luckily', 'can', 'hear', 'wheezing', 'microphone', 'have', 'secretly', 'inserted', 'villain', 'liar', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'Now', 'actually', 'have', 'reason', 'get', 'building', 'man', 'meds', 'Step', '2', 'Seize', 'opportunity', 'climb', 'spy', 'ranks', 'volunteering', 'high-risk', 'assignment', 'then', 'make', 'pass', 'senior', 'partner', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'be', 'alone', 'realize', 'how', 'dangerous', 'job', 'really', 'next', 'day', 'get', 'face', 'pushed', 'deep', 'fat', 'fryer', 'bad', 'guy', 'senior', 'partner', 'feels', 'guilty', 'did', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'comfort', 'Now', 'are', 'dead', 'will', 'skip', 'part', 'where', 'were', 'completely', 'unqualified', 'be', 'MI-5', 'instead', 'concentrate', 'sad', 'partner..Who', 'really', 'cute', 'now', 'very', 'sad', 'Cue', 'sad', 'music.Step', '3', 'Do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'live-in', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'really', 'spy', 'last', 'girlfriend', 'spilled', 'beans', 'friends', 'put', 'life', 'danger', 'had', 'dump', 'when', 'finally', 'do', 'come', 'out', 'DO', 'TELL', '5', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'whole', 'sordid', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'EVER', 'tell', 'friends', 'will', 'score', 'points', 'mom', 'Who', 'way', 'was', 'perfectly', 'okay', 'shacking', 'up', 'you-with', 'small', 'child', 'not', 'really', 'knowing', 'who', 'were', 'now', 'OUTRAGED', 'when', 'are', 'spy', 'government', 'there', 'nothing', 'worse', 'writers', 'expect', 'feel', 'pain', 'Lastly', 'portray', 'complete', 'stereotype', 'Americans', 'making', 'anti-abortion', 'bomber', 'woman', 'Ozarks', 'When', 'catch', 'leverage', 'interrogation', 'power', 'not', 'offering', 'extradite', 'Florida', 'know', 'where', 'actually', 'execute', 'people', 'Oh', 'gads', 'Not', 'electric', 'chair', 'Let', 'not', 'dwell', 'grizzly', 'crime', 'Instead', 'let', 'focus', 'how', 'feel', 'America', 'death', 'penalty', 'audience', 'will', 'never', 'realize', 'would', 'actually', 'be', 'tried', 'federal', 'level', 'terrorist', 'would', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'state', 'was', 'shipped', 'Then', 'when', 'extradite', 'have', 'Yank', 'cohorts', 'sinister', 'glee', 'inform', 'way', 'airport', 'that-despite', 'cooperation-', 'actually', 'going', 'Orlando', 'see', 'Micky', '.So', 'sinister', 'Yanks.This', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'grown', 'ups']","MI-5, Vol. 1"

780998,A2VODABWSVHV8E,B0000E32UZ,"Ray ""A Reader""","[0, 0]","Let's just say it and get it out the way: MI-5 is simply one of the greatest dramatic television series ever made. I know that's a ridiculously grandiose statement that is an easy target of criticism, but if you'll just browse down the titles of the 100+ reviews of MI-5 Season One here on Amazon, you'll be able to get some independent verification of that statement. It's quite true: once you get into this series, it is hard to think otherwise. It might take up through to the beginning of Season Two to be fully convinced, but after that, chances are you'll agree, and you'll want to watch the series all the way through.MI-5 is smart, dramatic, intelligent, exciting, thought provoking, well written and directed, beautifully filmed, and wonderfully acted. It's a crown jewel in the BBC's tiara, and will remain difficult to surpass for a very long time indeed.""MI-5"" (Military Intelligence, Section 5) is that part of the British security service that focuses on internal security and threats (as opposed to MI-6, which deals with extra- and international threats to the UK). This means that the service deals with any potential internal threat, including crime, terrorism, domestic economic threats, and counter-espionage. Its headquarters is in Thames House in London. The show MI-5 focuses on a variety of domestic threats arising from both domestic and international sources, and is based on the Section D Team within MI-5, which focuses on counter-terrorism, and is led by Harry Pearce (Peter Firth, in the role of his career). Although different issues and challenges arise in each show, and it is certainly possible to watch shows at random, the series is best enjoyed and appreciated when viewed in episode order due to the manner in which dramatic themes are built and extended across episodes. This is a show that rewards the viewer for effort put into watching the series in order.Season One does not get off to the best of starts. Most shows, particularly those as complicated and as wide reaching as MI-5, experience similar issues with the pilot episode, and MI-5 does not fully escape that fate. That's too bad, because some might see that first episode and decide the show is not quite their cup of tea. In my own mind, the first episode of Season One suffers from a contrived script on a too-obvious story (and, unfortunately, contains some needless violence that is thankfully not seen elsewhere in the series), but it should not really be missed if you wish to work through the show because of the cast introductions and orientations to the show that occur in this episode.  We can easily say that Episode One of Season was more for the benefit of the writers, cast, crew, and directors of the show rather than the viewers, but they all learned fast, and they learned well. As Season One progresses, we start feeling we are watching a well-oiled and precision racing machine that is gaining increasing momentum as the episodes unfold, and by the time we reach the cliff-hanging ending of Season One, we can easily see that this is an amazing show.Some of the Seasons have been hideously expensive to purchase on DVD, but some of that may be reduced at this point (late 2011). Each season normally contains either eight or ten episodes. However, when one considers that most of these episodes are more like mini-movies than television shows, the price becomes much more understandable. Unfortunately, no Blu-ray versions currently exist (to my knowledge). But the DVD quality is superb. Gorgeous filming and excellent sound make these episodes among the best you'll ever see from television.Is it allowable to give a seven out of five stars ranking? If so, that's how I would rate this show, particularly as we get into Seasons Two onward.Note ...To much agonizing around the world, MI-5 was finally ended by the BBC in late 2011 (Season Ten). As of December 2011, there is no word of the North American DVD release date, but most assume it to be either first or second quarter of 2012. The discussion boards and blogs were filled with sadness about the end of the show, but the BBC felt that this was the best place to tie off the show, probably for financial as well as artistic reasons. There is some talk of an American spin off. I am skeptical of that, because, although anyone can easily enjoy this show, it is quintessentially a British show, and that's really part of its appeal.",5,Five Stars Out of Five ...

Billed as a combination of '24' and other highly-regarded spy thrillers, MI-5 was not anywhere near the quality of 24.The first episode repeated the unoriginal concept that if a British drama has an American in it (especially one with a Southern accent), then the American is the guilty party and is generally an idiot or worse.  That's episode one.Episode two was no better.  In keeping with the liberal bent of the BBC, a politician who wanted to fight illegal immigration was evil, nasty, and worse to the people who want to decide themselves where they want to live, regardless of the country they've decided to move to.These two episodes were all that I could watch.

If they had concentrated on these ugly aspects of spying and governmental dysfunction, the series would be much more like the classics like the incomparable Sandbaggers.  Unfortunately the writers throw in quite a bit of boring and banal trivia concerning the love lives and of the agents and other personal details unrelated to the central aspect of spying.

In other ways, it is like Hamlet; research that to see how it ends.  One cannot take comfort  their favorite character will make it alive out of the episode where they are hanging upside down over a tank of piranhas (ok that scene does not exist, I'm just saying..).  In fact, the 2nd episode of the first season is missing on some streaming services (i.e. Netflix) because there was a scene so horrible, so disturbing, many angry viewers called in with complaints which jammed BBC phone switchboards.I appreciated the  unexpectedly long,  episodes, almost a full hour as like American TV used to be in the olden days.

In the next episode, however,  this plot was entirely truncated, the nemesis removed in an eyeblink cut scene with little explanation.The British MI-5 service shares some commonalities with the US FBI, handling domestic security concerns while the MI-6 probably is roughly equivalent to the CIA.

If luck snuggles with me, however, I might be handed a wad of cash, a passport and told to disappear.--The CIA is bad.--My superiors got some scam going on or are involved in some nefarious shadowy international plot.--I can expect to be framed at least once.--If I have offspring, they will be kidnapped and held hostage.--The traffic cams work pretty good.--Somebody I admired in the secret service, will at some point go crackers and jump off a building.Five stars minus one for following some aspects of Hamlet just a bit too closely.",4,Live an excitng but short life,1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,2587,"['whole', 'season', 'series', '1-10', 'not', 'physical', 'aspects', 'DVD', 'themselves.This', 'show', 'seen', 'back', 'back', 'episodes', 'ways', 'watching', 'gigantic', 'disaster', 'movie', 'where', 'only', 'few', 'long', 'term', 'actors', 'surviving', 'end', '10th', 'season', 'other', 'ways', 'like', 'Hamlet', 'research', 'see', 'how', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'comfort', 'favorite', 'character', 'will', 'make', 'alive', 'episode', 'where', 'are', 'hanging', 'upside', 'down', 'tank', 'piranhas', 'ok', 'scene', 'not', 'exist', ""'m"", 'just', 'saying..', 'fact', '2nd', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'missing', 'streaming', 'services', 'i.e', 'Netflix', 'was', 'scene', 'so', 'horrible', 'so', 'disturbing', 'many', 'angry', 'viewers', 'called', 'complaints', 'jammed', 'BBC', 'phone', 'switchboards.I', 'appreciated', 'unexpectedly', 'long', 'episodes', 'almost', 'full', 'hour', 'like', 'American', 'TV', 'used', 'be', 'olden', 'days', 'One', 'lot', 'show', 'most', 'series', 'tend', 'being', '40-45', 'minutes', 'host', 'are', 'increasing', 'content', 'consuming', 'parasitic', 'commercials.There', 'are', 'plenty', 'nail-biting', 'bomb', 'defusing', 'episodes', 'may', 'actually', 'go', 'off', 'watch', 'must', 'wonder', 'least', 'one', 'episodes', 'there', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'scenes', 'show', 'politic', 'event', 'promising', 'plot', 'development', 'strong', 'nemesis', 'humdinger', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'kept', 'riveted', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'next', 'episode', 'however', 'plot', 'was', 'entirely', 'truncated', 'nemesis', 'removed', 'eyeblink', 'cut', 'scene', 'little', 'explanation.The', 'British', 'MI-5', 'service', 'shares', 'commonalities', 'US', 'FBI', 'handling', 'domestic', 'security', 'concerns', 'MI-6', 'probably', 'roughly', 'equivalent', 'CIA', 'Broadly', 'one', 'Brit', 'put', 'MI6', 'are', 'spies', 'MI5', 'there', 'catch', 'spies.This', 'show', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'anything', 'common', 'real', 'MI5', 'service', 'assuming', 'are', 'things', 'learned', 'joined', 'MI5', 'very', 'good', 'chance', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'MI6.', 'good', 'chance', 'getting', 'killed', 'period', 'luck', 'snuggles', 'however', 'might', 'be', 'handed', 'wad', 'cash', 'passport', 'told', 'disappear.', 'CIA', 'bad.', 'superiors', 'got', 'scam', 'going', 'are', 'involved', 'nefarious', 'shadowy', 'international', 'plot.', 'can', 'expect', 'be', 'framed', 'least', 'once.', 'have', 'offspring', 'will', 'be', 'kidnapped', 'held', 'hostage.', 'traffic', 'cams', 'work', 'pretty', 'good.', 'Somebody', 'admired', 'secret', 'service', 'will', 'point', 'go', 'crackers', 'jump', 'off', 'building.Five', 'stars', 'minus', 'one', 'following', 'aspects', 'Hamlet', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'closely']","MI-5, Vol. 1"

I love Matthew MacFadyen in Pride & Prejudice (which he was in after he was done with this series) but I lost some respect for him after viewing this.  Really, any of the actors in this show who would act out such ridiculously prejudiced scenes have lost some of my respect.It's the typical liberal/socialist Brit attitude - Americans are out to execute all criminals, kill immigrants, and get involved in the Middle East just for oil.  That's the plot synopsis for episodes 1 - 3.Episode 1 features a devoutly Christian woman with a Southern American accent bent on killing abortion doctors in Britain.  Right, cause that makes sense.  We're just a bunch of murderous, self-righteous Bible-thumpers.  And America is so hell-bent on capturing terrorists that they want to haul her back to America to face execution (which, apparently, is just so awful), and don't care whether her people carry on with their plans to kill more people as long as America gets her.  And there are some snide remarks about ""the land of the free.""Episode 2 basically calls anyone who isn't for open, indiscriminate immigration into countries a right-wing, male chauvinist, abusive, murderous bastard.  It features an abusive, murderous man importing illegal immigrants from Chechnya into Britain so that they'll cause an immigration issue and cause Britain to close its borders.  He throws the people in the ocean to drown when his plans don't go right, and he jams a woman's head into a deep-fat fryer then shoots her, all in the name of keeping Britain for the British.  Yeah, ok, right.  Anyone who doesn't want people from all sorts of different countries, dangerous or not, entering their borders freely must be a soulless bastard.Then in Episode 3, terrorists are to be pitied because they must have righteous causes - their parents have been imprisoned for rebellion and their country was apparently persecuted by America for oil rights.  Terrorism is therefore justified, let's just try to understand them and it'll all be fine.  Ridiculous.It's unrealistic and inaccurate, heavily biased, and very clearly agenda-ridden.  I thought the Brits were supposed to be our allies?  Clearly not, with all this snide hatred and unjustified accusations infused into the show.
