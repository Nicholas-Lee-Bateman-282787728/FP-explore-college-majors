1266722,AHF97M45JFCB,B002FOQXVE,ONENEO,"[16, 17]","Nabari is an anime that is coming to the shores of North America for the first time ever thanks to Funimation. Based on a manga written and illustrated by Yuhki Kamatani, it was released in Japan by Square Enix back in 2004. The anime adaptation, which is being reviewed here, was directed by Kunihisa Sugishima, and animated by JC Staff then hit Japanese airwaves in April of 2008.  Funimation has been working to get the series here for American viewing pleasure since the summer of 2008 and now it looks like all of the legal mumbo jumbo involved to do so is behind them as indicated by the fact that this, The Complete Series Part One is set for a September 22 stateside release. But before I get ahead of myself, let's take a look at the cold hard facts, shall we?Nabari The Complete Series Part One comes in at a runtime of 325 minutes and contains 13 episodes spanning two discs. The discs come packaged in a pair of thin packs within a cardboard outer slipcase.The show wears an appropriate TV 14 rating due to some slightly adult slanted themes of violence, war, and conflict.  There is no nudity, swearing, or gore to report.Language options are typical sub and dub, which means the viewer has the choice of running either the original Japanese dialog track (stereo) or an English dub (Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround) and the option of displaying English subtitles beneath either dialog choice.Extras include textless songs, a commentary track from some of the English voice talent over Episode 2, and a host of upcoming Funimation anime previews.The story, which is surprisingly complex, goes like this:  The ho hum teen Miharu Rokujou wanted little more than to live a normal life in the hopes of one day inheriting an Okonomiyaki restaurant.  His buddies at school (Kouichi & Kumohira) continually pressure him to join their martial arts club to which he respectfully declines time and time again.  Miharu's tune changes once he's attacked by an actual group of ninjas and is protected by Kouichi and Kumohira. There, Miharu learns of a hidden world of ninjas and psychic powers (a place called Nabari) and discovers that people he thought he knew like his classmate and teacher were actually powerful figures in this new world.  As they had been trying to convince him, his very survival depends upon his mastery of the mysterious art Shinra Banshou.  Even more surprising is that Miharu discovers that he has a hijutsu (hidden technique) within him that just so happens to be control of the power of creation. Many rival clans are seeking the hijutsu as it is foretold that the one who possesses it will become the ruler of their world.While this may sound fairly straightforward when spelled out as such, the truth of the matter is that Nabari's presentation demands a viewer's undivided attention.  Expect episodes littered with flashbacks and recaps with hints of a deeper mystery being slowly unraveled in the moments between the action.Speaking of, there are some seriously wicked action sequences scattered about which will hopefully shield many viewers from dismissing this property as simply a Naruto wannabe.The first episode in particular sets a pretty cool pace for the rest of the episodes to follow with a nice combination of back-story and lead character development.The music score is appropriate and melds well with the visuals neither outshining the images nor becoming lost to the background.  Voice work is nice and tight in both language options with my vote leaning slightly to the English dub due to the fact that the story isn't linear and many names/ words can be confusing in any language.  As such the less I had to keep sorted at the time of viewing, the better.Funimation has already announced plans to release the remaining 13 episodes of the show to the North American market and I suspect it will be a very desirable purchase to anyone who has the pleasure of watching this collection.",4,The Ninja World is at War,1253404800,"09 20, 2009",2009,3927,"['Nabari', 'anime', 'coming', 'shores', 'North', 'America', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'thanks', 'Funimation', 'Based', 'manga', 'written', 'illustrated', 'Yuhki', 'Kamatani', 'was', 'released', 'Japan', 'Square', 'Enix', 'back', '2004', 'anime', 'adaptation', 'being', 'reviewed', 'here', 'was', 'directed', 'Kunihisa', 'Sugishima', 'animated', 'JC', 'Staff', 'then', 'hit', 'Japanese', 'airwaves', 'April', '2008', 'Funimation', 'been', 'working', 'get', 'series', 'here', 'American', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'summer', '2008', 'now', 'legal', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'involved', 'do', 'so', 'behind', 'indicated', 'fact', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Part', 'One', 'set', 'September', '22', 'stateside', 'release', 'get', 'ahead', 'let', 'take', 'look', 'cold', 'hard', 'facts', 'shall', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Part', 'One', 'runtime', '325', 'minutes', '13', 'episodes', 'spanning', 'two', 'discs', 'discs', 'come', 'packaged', 'pair', 'thin', 'packs', 'cardboard', 'outer', 'slipcase.The', 'show', 'appropriate', 'TV', '14', 'rating', 'due', 'slightly', 'adult', 'slanted', 'themes', 'violence', 'war', 'conflict', 'nudity', 'swearing', 'gore', 'report.Language', 'options', 'are', 'typical', 'sub', 'dub', 'viewer', 'choice', 'running', 'original', 'Japanese', 'dialog', 'track', 'stereo', 'English', 'dub', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'Surround', 'option', 'displaying', 'English', 'subtitles', 'dialog', 'choice.Extras', 'include', 'textless', 'songs', 'commentary', 'track', 'English', 'voice', 'talent', 'Episode', '2', 'host', 'upcoming', 'Funimation', 'anime', 'previews.The', 'story', 'surprisingly', 'complex', 'ho', 'hum', 'teen', 'Miharu', 'Rokujou', 'wanted', 'little', 'more', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'hopes', 'one', 'day', 'inheriting', 'Okonomiyaki', 'restaurant', 'buddies', 'school', 'Kouichi', 'Kumohira', 'continually', 'pressure', 'join', 'martial', 'arts', 'club', 'respectfully', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'Miharu', 'tune', 'changes', 'attacked', 'actual', 'group', 'ninjas', 'protected', 'Kouichi', 'Kumohira', 'Miharu', 'hidden', 'world', 'ninjas', 'psychic', 'powers', 'place', 'called', 'Nabari', 'people', 'thought', 'knew', 'classmate', 'teacher', 'were', 'actually', 'powerful', 'figures', 'new', 'world', 'had', 'been', 'trying', 'convince', 'very', 'survival', 'mastery', 'mysterious', 'art', 'Shinra', 'Banshou', 'Even', 'more', 'surprising', 'Miharu', 'hijutsu', 'hidden', 'technique', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'control', 'power', 'creation', 'Many', 'rival', 'clans', 'are', 'seeking', 'hijutsu', 'foretold', 'one', 'who', 'will', 'become', 'ruler', 'world.While', 'may', 'sound', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'when', 'spelled', 'out', 'such', 'truth', 'matter', 'Nabari', 'presentation', 'viewer', 'undivided', 'attention', 'Expect', 'littered', 'flashbacks', 'recaps', 'hints', 'deeper', 'mystery', 'being', 'slowly', 'unraveled', 'moments', 'action.Speaking', 'are', 'seriously', 'wicked', 'action', 'sequences', 'scattered', 'will', 'hopefully', 'shield', 'many', 'viewers', 'dismissing', 'property', 'simply', 'Naruto', 'wannabe.The', 'first', 'episode', 'particular', 'sets', 'pretty', 'cool', 'pace', 'rest', 'episodes', 'follow', 'nice', 'combination', 'back-story', 'lead', 'character', 'development.The', 'music', 'score', 'appropriate', 'melds', 'well', 'visuals', 'outshining', 'images', 'becoming', 'lost', 'background', 'Voice', 'work', 'nice', 'tight', 'language', 'options', 'vote', 'leaning', 'slightly', 'English', 'dub', 'due', 'fact', 'story', ""n't"", 'linear', 'many', 'names/', 'words', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'language', 'such', 'less', 'had', 'keep', 'sorted', 'time', 'viewing', 'better.Funimation', 'already', 'announced', 'plans', 'release', 'remaining', '13', 'episodes', 'show', 'North', 'American', 'market', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'desirable', 'purchase', 'anyone', 'who', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'collection']","Nabari No Ou: Complete Series, Part 1"

The basic storyline is that today there are still ninja that exist in what they call the hidden world Nabari where Ninja still use their skills and abilities as they did in years gone by from espionage to assassinations,  the ninja clans today exist in five groups each with their own unique skills and abilities but now some of these clans wish to retrieve a powerful ninja technique that if able to be controlled will allow the possessor to have the powers of a god.  This technique and knowledge unfortunately is sealed inside the body of a young boy who has no idea what's inside of him or the vast power he holds and thus starts the series as various factions in the ninja world seek either to harness and control this power or seal it away forever.  The characters are all entertaining and fun to see each with their own reasons or ideals of why their in this war and what they hope for after this battle is over.  The animation and soundtrack for the series are very good and fit the series perfectly and the voice cast for the characters for both the Japanese and English cast did a great job in their roles.  Sadly the extras aren't really that great though just the usual trailer and textless intro/ending songs with one or two commentaries but that's about it.  The price is a little expensive for this set and I was able to get it at a better price but still at the end stil a entertaining series regardless....",5,If You're A Fan Of Ninja Animes Here's Another Good One For Your Collection,1266969600,"02 24, 2010",2010,1578,"['series', 'be', 'nice', 'mix', 'Naruto', 'Basilisk', 'X/1999', 'put', 'together', 'story', 'series', 'watching', 'up', 'end', 'basic', 'storyline', 'today', 'are', 'still', 'exist', 'what', 'call', 'hidden', 'world', 'Nabari', 'where', 'Ninja', 'still', 'use', 'skills', 'abilities', 'did', 'years', 'gone', 'espionage', 'assassinations', 'ninja', 'clans', 'today', 'exist', 'five', 'groups', 'own', 'unique', 'skills', 'abilities', 'now', 'clans', 'wish', 'retrieve', 'powerful', 'ninja', 'technique', 'able', 'be', 'controlled', 'will', 'allow', 'possessor', 'have', 'powers', 'god', 'technique', 'knowledge', 'unfortunately', 'sealed', 'body', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'idea', 'what', 'inside', 'vast', 'power', 'thus', 'series', 'various', 'factions', 'ninja', 'world', 'seek', 'harness', 'control', 'power', 'seal', 'away', 'forever', 'characters', 'are', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'see', 'own', 'reasons', 'ideals', 'why', 'war', 'what', 'hope', 'battle', 'animation', 'soundtrack', 'series', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'fit', 'series', 'perfectly', 'voice', 'cast', 'characters', 'Japanese', 'English', 'cast', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'roles', 'Sadly', 'extras', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'great', 'just', 'usual', 'trailer', 'textless', 'intro/ending', 'songs', 'one', 'two', 'commentaries', 'price', 'little', 'expensive', 'set', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'better', 'price', 'still', 'end', 'stil', 'entertaining', 'series', 'regardless']","Nabari No Ou: Complete Series, Part 1"

1266725,AV1WAYOHXD1MA,B002FOQXVE,"The Pes ""Deerhoads""","[0, 0]","Nabari no Ou is a dilemma of a show.  On the one hand you have a fantastic, interesting twist on your usual ninja fare.  On the other, you have an apathetic central character in Miharu that makes it hard to connect with him and the story.  As a viewer you have two choices: can you connect enough with said central character to keep watching? or, do you keep watching because you are interested enough in the world and the plot, Miharu not withstanding, to see the series to the end?It's a troubling question and one that totally depends on your bond with Miharu and his apathy.  The problem, in my opinion, is that Miharu as a central character lacks the motivation for you, the viewer, to keep watching after a few episodes, let alone 13 of them.  His total disregard for the consequences that are present just on the fact that he is who he is, can be grating and frustrating.  It seems that he isn't much of a catalyst for the things that are happening, but rather, he seems to be a reluctant passenger in other people's ambitions.  He's just there for the ride, one that he wouldn't really care to be on if given a choice.If that was the only value that the series has, then I'd say this would be a waste of your time.  However, the fact that different factions within the Nabari world want him for what's inside him, redeem the plot to make it interesting enough to keep watching.  Particularly of note are some of the key players in both the Banten and Kairoshu clans.If given the chance, I'd make Tabari Sensei the key player of this anime.  The school teacher assigned to take care of Miharu, he has a real dilemma in his hands.  His personal convictions go directly against the natural world of the Nabari, in that he sees killing an unnecessary part of his work.  This really struck me as an interesting aspect of this character's persona.  A person who willingly entered a world where murder, and violence take precedence to finish a job and is totally against that sounds way more interesting to me than an indifferent youth.  This is real, personal conflict, which is in stark contrast to Miharu's apathy.The players from the other clans also fare more interesting, but don't really stand out from what we've seem before in other anime.  Needless to say, the plot does get better as we get closer to the end of this set.  Boundaries shift and key twists happen around the last few episodes that it starts to spice up the threads of the plot.And even if the plot doesn't excite as much, the fight scenes and artistry will.  Top notch animation and fight scenes litter the show.  There is enough eye candy here to kick the adrenaline up.  Of particular note is the first fight between the Banten and Kairoshu factions.  A real treat.As much as the animation kicks...you know what...the comedy here too is appreciated.  Even though Miharu might not be your typical leading figure, his comedy bits are funny, especially when he decides to pick on Tabari.  It's good to have these moments of lightheartedness.  It gives the viewer some breathing room for the seriousness that surrounds the plot.Overall, this series is a tough one to watch for some viewers.  It really isn't a cut-and-dry plot where you see a clear division between good and evil.  The main lead isn't a charmer either, and to me, leaves a lot to be desired.  But, I can't fault the story either as it sets a premise that's interesting and one that will intrigue you if you keep going.  After episode 10, things start to change enough that the story starts to grow on you.  And even though Miharu doesn't really change much from the beginning, he starts to show an inkling of humanity, which is a welcomed change.My advice is to at least give it a chance.  To some the main character might be too passive, and not enough to keep going.  However, if you look at the whole picture, there is enough here to warrant a good look at the series.",3,Emo Ninjas can be a bit of a drag...,1270425600,"04 5, 2010",2010,3913,"['Nabari', 'Ou', 'dilemma', 'show', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'fantastic', 'interesting', 'twist', 'usual', 'ninja', 'fare', 'other', 'have', 'apathetic', 'central', 'character', 'Miharu', 'hard', 'connect', 'story', 'viewer', 'have', 'two', 'choices', 'can', 'connect', 'enough', 'said', 'central', 'character', 'keep', 'watching', 'do', 'keep', 'watching', 'are', 'interested', 'enough', 'world', 'plot', 'Miharu', 'not', 'withstanding', 'see', 'series', 'end', 'troubling', 'question', 'one', 'totally', 'bond', 'Miharu', 'apathy', 'problem', 'opinion', 'Miharu', 'central', 'character', 'motivation', 'viewer', 'keep', 'watching', 'few', 'episodes', 'let', 'alone', '13', 'total', 'disregard', 'consequences', 'are', 'present', 'just', 'fact', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'grating', 'frustrating', ""n't"", 'much', 'catalyst', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'rather', 'be', 'reluctant', 'passenger', 'other', 'people', 'ambitions', 'just', 'there', 'ride', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'be', 'given', 'choice.If', 'was', 'only', 'value', 'series', 'then', ""'d"", 'say', 'would', 'be', 'waste', 'time', 'However', 'fact', 'different', 'factions', 'Nabari', 'world', 'want', 'what', 'inside', 'redeem', 'plot', 'make', 'interesting', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'Particularly', 'note', 'are', 'key', 'players', 'Banten', 'Kairoshu', 'clans.If', 'given', 'chance', ""'d"", 'make', 'Tabari', 'Sensei', 'key', 'player', 'anime', 'school', 'teacher', 'assigned', 'take', 'care', 'Miharu', 'real', 'dilemma', 'hands', 'personal', 'convictions', 'go', 'directly', 'natural', 'world', 'Nabari', 'killing', 'unnecessary', 'part', 'work', 'really', 'struck', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'character', 'persona', 'person', 'who', 'willingly', 'entered', 'world', 'where', 'murder', 'violence', 'take', 'precedence', 'finish', 'job', 'totally', 'way', 'more', 'interesting', 'indifferent', 'youth', 'real', 'personal', 'conflict', 'stark', 'contrast', 'Miharu', 'apathy.The', 'players', 'other', 'clans', 'also', 'fare', 'more', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seem', 'other', 'anime', 'Needless', 'say', 'plot', 'get', 'better', 'get', 'closer', 'end', 'set', 'Boundaries', 'shift', 'key', 'twists', 'happen', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'spice', 'up', 'threads', 'plot.And', 'even', 'plot', ""n't"", 'excite', 'as', 'much', 'fight', 'scenes', 'artistry', 'will', 'Top', 'notch', 'animation', 'fight', 'scenes', 'litter', 'show', 'enough', 'eye', 'candy', 'here', 'kick', 'adrenaline', 'up', 'particular', 'note', 'first', 'fight', 'Banten', 'Kairoshu', 'factions', 'real', 'treat.As', 'much', 'animation', 'kicks', 'know', 'what', 'comedy', 'here', 'too', 'appreciated', 'Even', 'Miharu', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'typical', 'leading', 'figure', 'comedy', 'bits', 'are', 'funny', 'especially', 'when', 'pick', 'Tabari', 'good', 'have', 'moments', 'lightheartedness', 'viewer', 'breathing', 'room', 'seriousness', 'plot.Overall', 'series', 'tough', 'one', 'watch', 'viewers', 'really', ""n't"", 'cut-and-dry', 'plot', 'where', 'see', 'clear', 'division', 'good', 'evil', 'main', 'lead', ""n't"", 'charmer', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'story', 'premise', 'interesting', 'one', 'will', 'intrigue', 'keep', 'going', 'episode', '10', 'things', 'start', 'change', 'enough', 'story', 'grow', 'even', 'Miharu', ""n't"", 'really', 'change', 'much', 'beginning', 'show', 'inkling', 'humanity', 'welcomed', 'change.My', 'advice', 'least', 'give', 'chance', 'main', 'character', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'passive', 'not', 'enough', 'keep', 'going', 'However', 'look', 'whole', 'picture', 'enough', 'here', 'warrant', 'good', 'look', 'series']","Nabari No Ou: Complete Series, Part 1"
1266726,A16I1TNBSOLQFG,B002FOQXVE,Tristan A. Hayes,"[0, 0]","Nabari no ou is really a series that is quite interesting in what it tries to accomplish this set contains the first 13 episodes of the 26 episode anime series. In the most basic sense the story takes place in modern times in which there is an outside world (the real world) and a world of ninjas and samurai aligned in something called the nabari world. In this world people excel in sword skills or elemental skills.  There are also special forbidden skills written on scrolls that each clan in this world essentially holds and protects.The main character is one of those anime characters that tries to be essentially apathetic towards everything and doesnt try to reveal his own true feelings to others. Its pretty predictable and a bit grating to see this and even thirteen episodes in. However the character does have some bits of comedy in which he tries to act devious to get what he wants by acting or appearing weak and helpless.  The premise is that everyone is after him because somehow in some history that wasnt exactly ever cleared out (it was shown but never explicitly stated) that he has this extremely powerful power in him that will allow whomever to control it to control the nabari world.There are several ministories that run throughout the series in which essentially each member of the cast and extended cast (foes) historys are explored and such.  Midway through the series the main character Miharu decides to do something that essentially changes the actual flow of the series and the main plot (which is still in tact but Miharu, the main character, wants to be worthwhile and ignores what all but one person wants).I have a few gripes with the series, mainly the choice of voice actors (english) for the main character is a female (voice of Tony Tony Chopper in English) and it is pretty obvious at times (quite a lot of the times) that it took me out of believing that the main character was male.  A few other characters have interesting voice actors were for Gau (voice similar to Kaoru Hitachin from Ouran High School Host Club), and Raikou (voice of  Kyoya Ootori from Ouran High School Host Club).  I think the plot also tries to get serious but the decision of the main character prevents it from becoming a serious tale of uniting the ninja world and exploring this power, to one of just catering to someone who is just a loner who wants to disappear.  The most interesting story was the one with the mind reader, and its fortunate that her secretary is a recurring character.  The side cast is also strong and the opposing clan of the heroes is actually pretty interesting to see and likeable too.All in all just the standard fare of boxset for anime, not really any special features.  The opening theme is pretty catchy (Crawl by Veltpunch) the ending theme I actually usually skipped and the previews as well.  There were english subtitles as well as japanese voice overs.  The font was acceptable too.",3,An OK series that deserves to be seen,1277078400,"06 21, 2010",2010,2942,"['Nabari', 'ou', 'really', 'series', 'quite', 'interesting', 'what', 'accomplish', 'set', 'first', '13', 'episodes', '26', 'episode', 'anime', 'series', 'most', 'basic', 'sense', 'story', 'place', 'modern', 'times', 'outside', 'world', 'real', 'world', 'world', 'ninjas', 'samurai', 'aligned', 'something', 'called', 'nabari', 'world', 'world', 'people', 'excel', 'sword', 'skills', 'elemental', 'skills', 'are', 'also', 'special', 'forbidden', 'skills', 'written', 'scrolls', 'clan', 'world', 'essentially', 'protects.The', 'main', 'character', 'one', 'anime', 'characters', 'be', 'essentially', 'apathetic', 'towards', 'everything', 'doesnt', 'try', 'reveal', 'own', 'true', 'feelings', 'others', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'bit', 'grating', 'see', 'even', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'However', 'character', 'have', 'bits', 'comedy', 'act', 'devious', 'get', 'what', 'acting', 'appearing', 'weak', 'helpless', 'premise', 'everyone', 'somehow', 'history', 'exactly', 'ever', 'cleared', 'out', 'was', 'shown', 'never', 'explicitly', 'stated', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'power', 'will', 'allow', 'whomever', 'control', 'control', 'nabari', 'are', 'several', 'ministories', 'run', 'series', 'essentially', 'member', 'cast', 'extended', 'cast', 'foes', 'historys', 'are', 'explored', 'such', 'Midway', 'series', 'main', 'character', 'Miharu', 'do', 'something', 'essentially', 'actual', 'flow', 'series', 'main', 'plot', 'still', 'tact', 'Miharu', 'main', 'character', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'what', 'one', 'person', '.I', 'have', 'few', 'gripes', 'series', 'mainly', 'choice', 'voice', 'actors', 'english', 'main', 'character', 'female', 'voice', 'Tony', 'Tony', 'Chopper', 'English', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'times', 'lot', 'times', 'took', 'believing', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'male', 'few', 'other', 'characters', 'have', 'interesting', 'voice', 'actors', 'were', 'Gau', 'voice', 'similar', 'Kaoru', 'Hitachin', 'Ouran', 'High', 'School', 'Host', 'Club', 'Raikou', 'voice', 'Kyoya', 'Ootori', 'Ouran', 'High', 'School', 'Host', 'Club', 'think', 'plot', 'also', 'get', 'serious', 'decision', 'main', 'character', 'prevents', 'becoming', 'serious', 'tale', 'uniting', 'ninja', 'world', 'exploring', 'power', 'one', 'just', 'catering', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'loner', 'who', 'disappear', 'most', 'interesting', 'story', 'was', 'one', 'mind', 'reader', 'fortunate', 'secretary', 'recurring', 'character', 'side', 'cast', 'also', 'strong', 'opposing', 'clan', 'heroes', 'actually', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'see', 'likeable', 'too.All', 'just', 'standard', 'fare', 'boxset', 'anime', 'not', 'really', 'special', 'features', 'opening', 'theme', 'pretty', 'catchy', 'Crawl', 'Veltpunch', 'ending', 'theme', 'actually', 'usually', 'skipped', 'previews', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'english', 'subtitles', 'as', 'well', 'japanese', 'voice', 'overs', 'font', 'was', 'acceptable', 'too']","Nabari No Ou: Complete Series, Part 1"
