As the years go by, their lives take decidedly different roads. However, their friendship is rekindled when an unexpected visitor comes to town, forcing Cobbs to deal with some ghosts from his military service and the two of them to revisit some long forgotten childhood memories.

This movie is very good to watch as it shows that things are not always what they seem to be.  People do things for reasons known only to themselves and you might not understand why.  James Garner's acting is superb as he always is.  He doesn't understand why an old friend whom he has lost contact with will not accept the medal he is deserving of.  But Garner doesn't know the whole story which neither does the medal recipient.,5,Replacing a video with dvd,1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,505,"['am', 'replacing', 'video', 'collection', 'DVD', 'one', 'replace', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'watch', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'People', 'do', 'things', 'reasons', 'known', 'only', 'might', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'James', 'Garner', 'acting', 'superb', 'always', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'old', 'friend', 'whom', 'lost', 'contact', 'will', 'not', 'accept', 'medal', 'deserving', 'Garner', ""n't"", 'know', 'whole', 'story', 'medal', 'recipient']",N/A
