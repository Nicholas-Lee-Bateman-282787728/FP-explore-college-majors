The artwork and animation are inventive and believable.  The creative team successfully juggles more superheros than I can count, and they do it without any objectionable content -- unless you find cartoon fight scenes objectionable.  There are plenty of fight scenes, but there is also excellent character development and many unexpected plot twists.  The only problem with this disc is the fact that the story does not end when the last episode is played.  You must buy Season Two, Part 2 to find out how the Reach is defeated.  Still, Part 1 has enough of an ending that if you never bought Part 2, you wouldn't sit up late at night wondering what happened.

1600756,A205BECZCE6DAU,B009OAWMK8,"Dennis M. Roy ""animation addict""","[0, 0]","First of all, it has to be said up front that this series is not ideally suited to kids. It is dark. The color pallet here is significantly muted compared to previous DC animated series. Even the soundtrack is sonically keyed to be darker and more intense, as opposed to the more heroic and triumphal themes heard in previous DC cartoons. There is a bit of a pall of gloom hanging over the heads of our protagonists throughout the sometimes dire proceedings of the entire series. There are lots of secrets and conspiracies here, and complex character interrelationships that evolve and change over the course of the show. While these qualities can be appreciated by older teens and adults, most of the subtleties are likely to be lost on the 14 and under viewer (depending on the intelligence and maturity level of the individual kid, of course - or perhaps best viewed by children with an engaged adult viewer with whom to discuss it). Unfortunately, Amazon's 'Editorial Review' doesn't begin to give potential purchasers a hint of the actual TONE of this series. There's plenty of 'action', but the level of violence is somewhat higher than is typical for most Saturday morning animated programming (although that could perhaps also be said of STAR WARS: THE CLONE WARS, for example). The attention level required for a true appreciation of the show's qualities is probably more than most kids would have. This would explain, in part, the reason the show failed to last beyond 2 seasons, airing as it did in an early Saturday morning time slot on Cartoon Network. The sad fact is that the fate of all DC animated series on Cartoon Network is inextricably tied to the merchandising of a toy line based on the series. If the show spawns a viable merchandise line, then money is returned to Cartoon Network via advertising revenue from the toy manufacturers. GREEN LANTERN THE ANIMATED SERIES was cancelled because major buyer Wal-Mart refused to buy a toy line based on the series, after they felt they'd been burned by loads of unsold toys based on the Green Lantern movie starring Ryan Reynolds. Young Justice DID generate a toy line in its first season, but the toy line didn't do well among young kids. It's easy to see why. The overall darkness of the show and complexly-plotted ongoing story arcs in both seasons were hard for kids to follow. YOUNG JUSTICE was written at the same approximate level as regular mainstream DC comics (as opposed to the `DC Kids' comics line) - even BETTER, dare I say, than the 'typical' mainstream DC comic title. The mainstream DC comics line mainly appeals to older teenagers and adult 20-somethings and up. This series really should have been programmed by CN in an 8pm evening time slot, as opposed to early Saturday morning when the audience is mostly younger viewers. Then there was CN's crazy schedule of 'show a half-dozen episodes, take a break for months at a time, then show another small block'. Heck, the intricately-dovetailing plotlines of a dozen characters is even a little hard to keep straight in your mind when watching this series one-episode-after-the-next on DVD (not a criticism, by the way), so it's easy to see how disjointed it would appear in all but the most dedicated viewers' minds with long gaps between new episodes. Quite frankly, I had given up on trying to follow the show out of frustration while it was airing (but mostly NOT airing) on CN. I just decided to hold out and wait until all the Season Two episodes were available on DVD, and I'm glad I did. This is definitely the way to go (or streaming them online, or on-demand on cable) for viewing this series. That way the viewer controls the number of episodes he watches at one sitting, and how quickly he progresses to the next batch of episodes. I have a MUCH greater appreciation of the show now than I ever did when watching it earlier on CN. I must admit, in the instance of going from Season One to Season Two, where CN had aired the last episode of Season One, with the first episode of Season Two airing immediately following the next week (this, after a seemingly interminable hiatus prior to the last few episodes of Season One), that the huge shift of the 'Five Year Gap' between seasons really threw me off. I had not been following any advance news of the series online, so the major revamping of the cast, with a completely-new YJ team line-up composed of characters totally unseen in the first season, and a radically-different status quo for each of the original cast members, took me entirely by surprise. I really felt like I had missed a whole season in there somewhere - but that didn't make sense. How was that possible? I felt like I was just really beginning to know and get into the cast from Season One, since these characters as they appeared in the YJ series were quite different than their counterparts in the regular DC comic books - and all of a sudden the rug had been pulled out from under me. When you watch the series on DVD, you can see how the ongoing subplots eventually do circle back to unresolved threads left over from the first season, but initially the shock of going from Season One to Season Two was just too disorienting. It almost felt like an entirely new show at the outset. This is definitely a series that requires the viewer's attentiveness at all times. Letting your mind or your eyes wander from the screen for a few seconds is detrimental to your understanding and appreciation of the complex character interrelationships and the multiple ongoing plot threads in play. The writers throw twist after twist at the viewer - it seemed to me that a new revelation or previously-undisclosed nugget of information (which causes you to have to reassess your entire previous knowledge of the show) was being uncovered, on average, every 4 episodes or so. As with Season One, it took a number of episodes for me to warm up to some of these characters, but in the end, this series even had me liking Jaime Reyes, the new Blue Beetle. Of course I say new, but this character has actually been around in the DC universe since 2006. I was a big fan of the previous Blue Beetle, Ted Kord, and was rather miffed at DC for the way he was unceremoniously sacrificed (after only ever having starred in one comic book series of his own, all the way back in the 1980s, he was never given another chance) to make way for Jaime Reyes, who to me appeared to be a transparent attempt at 'cultural diversity' by replacing established DC characters with a new 'ethnic' variation that DC could hold up as an example of their political and social consciousness. He was immediately given his own comic book, which was then cancelled after 36 issues (lasting 12 issues longer than the previous Blue Beetle's series). He then made appearances on BATMAN THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD and SMALLVILLE before getting another comic book series of his own in 2011 (this one lasted for 16 issues). It did seem as though this character was almost being forced upon the public, as part of a 'mandate to diversify', which always annoys me. But Young Justice Season Two is actually the first time I have liked the character, which I guess is something to be said. Although there's no real continuity between the two series, it was nice that WB included three key appearances of the Blue Beetle from B: TBATB on the Season Two, Part 1 DVD collection of the show, as those episodes help give the viewer some context on the Jaime Reyes version of the character, particularly relative to the previous Blue Beetle, Ted Kord.In summary, although the show presents an 'alternate universe' version of the DC Universe most comic book fans and viewers of previous DC animated series have come to know and love, which may require just a bit of time to warm up to, I would highly recommend this to older viewers and readers of the DC comic books.",5,Highly rewarding viewing for the older superhero fan.,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,7869,"['First', 'all', 'be', 'said',

The move gives show runners an opportunity to throw in some new characters without having to take the time to pave the way for them. &#34;Young Justice: Invasion Destiny Calling - Season Two Volume One&#34; contains the first ten episodes of the series on two discs.When the Justice League is called off-world to stand trial for crimes against another galaxy, the Young Justice team is expected to step up their game as protectors of the Earth. The first challenge they come up against is an alien force with sinister plans for humankind. Then the team comes head-to-head with the Light again. This time the legion of super-criminals are aided by a deadly alien force known as the Partner.The super heroes from the first season are still here, but they're older and more mature in their crime-fighting. Original Robin, Dick Grayson, has stepped up into the role of team leader as Nightwing. He's joined by new members Wonder Girl, Blue Beetle, Batgirl, Beast Boy, Bumblebee, a new Robin, and a group of Meta-Humans with different abilities.&#34;Young Justice: Invasion Destiny Calling - Season Two Volume One&#34; continues to weave complex storylines and character subplots much like an animated version of a daytime soap opera. This keeps viewers coming back for more week after week. I'll watch most animated shows once, but &#34;Young Justice&#34; demands more because of its intricacy. Each episode is just as enjoyable to take in the second time.The writers of &#34;Young Justice&#34; inject enough humor and personality into each of the characters to get viewers emotionally attached to them. This says a lot about the quality you can expect from the show. It's more effort than most creators used to put into an animated show.There's not much here as far as special features are concerned. I'd love to see a &#34;Behind the Scenes&#34; featurette showing the voice actors working on the show. Some interviews with the animators, cast, and crew would be excellent as well.

I really appreciate how WB chooses bonus episodes  that are relevent to that particular release/story line. And Blue Beetle has almost taken over the whole show, which is too bad, because he is not one of my favorites. Despite its silly anime style, I would have liked them to use the Teen Titans episodes which featured the original Titans: Speedy, Kid Flash and Aqualad (Garth) as the bonus episodes. The one with Nightwing would've been awesome too.It truly is sad if Cartoon Network is cancelling Young Justice and Green Lantern while garbage like Annoying Orange, endless anime, and live action crap remains.  I do not understand these people, YJ and GL are the best shows on Cartoon Network. But, then again it doesn't surprise me or most of you either. They show 10 episodes, then repeats, take the show off the air until the following year to stretch it, then out of the blue, bring it back. And they love to release shoddy dvd collections with only 4 eps instead of the full season of only 20-26 episodes like the sad money grubbers that they are.

1600774,AZXFS8GCTSQ5R,B009OAWMK8,NF,"[1, 1]","The Young Justice is what the Teen Titans television series should have been. Even though it's about some of the same heroes, the difference between these two series is night and day. The Teen Titans series was clearly aimed at children, whereas this can be enjoyed by anyone who's a fan of comic books and super heroes, adult and child alike. This DVD contains ten episodes on two DVDs which, quite frankly, is something of a ripoff. I recommend waiting for Warner Brothers to release the full season on DVD, which will end up costing you one-half or even one-third of the price of purchasing the season in separate parts, as well as giving you the entire season in one collection.Season 2 of the Young Justice takes place five years after the events of Season 1 and the season opens with a reminder of a cliffhanger from Season 1: six members of the Justice League (Martian Manhunter, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Hawkgirl, Superman, and Batman) went missing for 16 hours while under the mental control of Vandal Savage. Where did they go and what did they do?We are quickly introduced to some changes on the team over the past five years. We open with Robin (Tim Drake), leading a team comprised of Superboy, Miss Martian, Beast Boy, Bumblebee, and the Blue Beetle to capture Clayface. Back at Mount Justice, we see Nightwing, now the leader of the Young Justice team, and Lagoon Boy sparring while Mal waits for Bumblebee's return. We also see that Miss Martian and Lagoon Boy are now an item. Additional team members include Wonder Girl (Cassie, not Donna Troy), Arsenal (aka Red Arrow aka Speedy), Impulse, and Batgirl, among others.Some noteworthy longer story arcs in these episodes:1. Miss Martian has gained far more confidence in her powers from the first season but that confidence has grown to the point where it has become a problem, where her arrogance may have ramifications that she is not prepared to handle.2. The evolution of Blue Beetle, a young Hispanic lad in this incarnation of the character. Where did he come from? What is the origin of his powers? Who is he constantly talking to?3.  The Light reappears as the primary foe but a new villain also appears in this series. But who are they? And what is their ultimate goal?4. Not everything is what it seems, as there are spies, counter-spies, and betrayals galore.On Disc 1:Happy New Year - Lobo, the intergalactic bounty hunter, appears at the UN, determined to capture the Secretary General. He succeeds, despite the best efforts of Wonder Girl and Batgirl, but all is not what it seems, as the two astonished Young Justice members discover. What they uncover is an alien conspiracy, which requires the attention of the entire Young Justice team as well as the Justice League. It seems that an alien race has been setting up shop on Earth, traveling back and forth via Zeta beam technology. Adam Strange joins the league to help deal with the incursion. This is also the beginning of the story arc about the missing 16 hours, as we learn just a bit about what the missing members were up to.Earthlings - This episode takes place concurrently with the previous episode, as Superboy, Miss Martian, and Beast Boy join Adam Strange on Rann, investigating the source of the Zeta beams that have been transporting aliens to Earth. This is the beginning of the story arc about Miss Martian's problems, including what happened between her and Superboy as well as more about the extent of her powers and her use of them.Alienated - Slowly but surely, the aliens are being rooted out. In this episode, we finally get the first glimpse of one of the major foes for the season, as the Light makes a cameo experience. We also learn, via an update from Miss Martian, who had read the mind of an alien general in the previous episode, just what the Justice League members had been doing during the missing 16 hours. We also get the first look at Aqualad in Season 2 but is he still the hero that he was in Season 1? And just who is Aqualad's real father?Salvage - This episode opens with Red Arrow foiling a robbery but as we see him returning the stolen cash to the store owner, we also see him slipping some of that cash into his own pocket. Regrettably for Roy, Green Arrow is also watching and he decides to stage an intervention, with Black Canary, Nightwing, Jim Harper, and Kid Flash. As we learned in Season 1, the current Red Arrow is a clone of the real Roy Harper and he needs the money because he's desperate to find the man from which he was cloned. Meanwhile, Superboy and Blue Beetle are investigating Intergang, known for trafficking in alien technology and weapons. Unfortunately, what they find may be more than they can handle. In this episode, we learn more about Blue Beetle's origin and powers, a new villain makes a first, and unforgettable, appearance, and we find out what's been happening with Artemis and her sister Jade, better known as Cheshire.Beneath - Someone is kidnapping youths but who? And why? The Blue Beetle would like to know since once of those abductees is his friend. Meanwhile, the team of Wonder Girl, Miss Martian, Batgirl, and Bumblebee head to Bialya to investigate why the rogue state has seen a significant uptick in boom tube activity. Queen Bee is still the ruler of Bialya and still has the power to control men but Simon, the Light's telepath, is still in a coma in a Bialyan hospital after his prior encounter with Miss Martian (in Season 1). Or is he? And is there a connection between these two cases?On Disc 2:Bloodlines - A new character is introduced, arriving from the future and claiming to be related to a current member of the Justice League. But who is he, really? And what is his ultimate goal? And what is his connection to the new (and out of control and very powerful) villain that has just appeared on the scene? And who is the mysterious group behind this new villain? Meanwhile, Red Arrow and Cheshire are on the trail of the original Roy Harper, a trail that takes them to Tibet.Depths - Artemis is called back into action by Nightwing on a special mission to safeguard the launch of the first Earth-Mars communications satellite. The Light, however, have other ideas and the resulting conflict will end up with a member of the Young Justice team captured and another member of the team paying the ultimate price. We also learn more about the evolution of Miss Martian and what happened between her and Superboy.Satisfaction - The real Roy Harper has been found and he now finds out that he's been on ice for eight years while the clone took his place. And that his arm has been removed so that the Light could have an endless supply of his DNA for their cloning experiments. Lex Luthor owes Roy a debt for his missing arm and the missing 8 years and Roy is coming to collect...Darkest - The Light require one more test of allegiance and the result will be an attack on Mount Justice itself by an old friend accompanied by the Terror Twins, Jack Frost, and a new villain, Tigress, as the members of the Young Justice team succumb, one by one. And when all is done, nothing will be the same. There are wheels within wheels within wheels in this episode as friend and foe alike try to make sense of events.Before the Dawn - Several members of the Young Justice team have been captured, as we finally get to meet the mysterious partners of the Light, who have been hiding in the shadows throughout the series. And we finally learn more about why they are fascinated with Earth and what they want with the people they have been kidnapping. We also learn more about the origin of the Blue Beetle as we find out that he is not as unique as he thought he was, and we find out more about one possible future that horrifies the team. The Miss Martian storyline reaches a conclusion in this episode, as well, which will have ramifications for the rest of the season. And after the crushing defeat of the last episode, the Young Justice team has finally had enough and is ready to kick some serious butt.Peeves:- The character of G. Gordon Godfrey, annoying talk-show host, really didn't work for me. I assume that the character is intended to be a cross between Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh but, as voiced by Tim Curry, all it did was irritate me. I was expecting that there would be some payoff for this, some comeuppance as had happened in a prior Justice League episode, but it never happened.- Use of &#34;the Light&#34; again as the primary villain. It was good in the first season, since it was kept hidden for much of the season and since the mystery built to good effect throughout the season, but now that we know the truth in the second season, this basically became just another attack by the Injustice Society. I can't help wishing they had gone in a different direction.- The (over)use of really deep gravelly voices for various heroes and villains got to be a bit much.- Impulse's use of the word &#34;crash&#34; just gets annoying. I felt like saying, a la &#34;Mean Girls,&#34; &#34;Stop trying to make 'crash' happen!&#34; I had the same reaction to Lagoon Boy's overuse of the phrase, &#34;Neptune's Beard!&#34;Despite the peeves, there is a lot to like in this series, which is why I'm giving it four stars. There are decent individual storylines and story arcs throughout the season, very good animation for a television series, and, of course, a lot of action. It's still a worthwhile addition to the Warner Brothers DC Universe canon and I can recommend it (although I still recommend waiting for the full season to be released).",4,Not quite up to Season 1;

1600775,A2CGEI95LY2R4G,B009OAWMK8,Nicole,"[1, 2]","Young Justice: Invasion-Destiny CallingThe cover is Young Justice with the new team members. It's a simple collage of the team with the basic members. Miss Martian, Blue Beetle, Robin (Tim Drake), Superboy, Wondergirl (Cassie), Batgirl and Nightwing are the line up for the cover.There are two disks with ten episodes in total. Five episodes are in each disk.Young Justice Season Disk One is blue and the art cover is Blue Beetle. He's a new member of Young Justice.Episodes-Happy New Year, Earthlings, Alienated, Salvage and BeneathThe opening trailers were to promote Lego Batman the Movie DC Superheroes Unit. The animation is in LEGO and Scooby Mask of the Blue Falcon.The menu of these DVDS are the same to Young Justice Season One which really irked me considering the team had changed since there was a five year skip. I don't know if it was the budget but it just seemed pretty lazy. I would of thought the backgrounds would have changed to the new team at least instead of pre-skip. This goes for all the pictures in the menu. The background is the same because the theme to Young Justice didn't change.Episodes: The background is Aqualad before time skip.Languages is Robin where you can have Audio in English, French, Spanish, or PortugueseHearing subtitles come in English, Spanish, or  PortugueseIf you click next is disclaimer for Young Justice. The background is Superboy during the first two episodes in Season one breaking out of Cadmus.Special features:Background is Kid Flash before time skip.In Disk one it contains three special Batman: The Brave and the Bold episodes. Theses episodes are very special because it explains somewhat the secret behind the Blue Beetle. The titles are Rise of the Blue, Beetle, Fall of the Blue Beetle and Revenge of the Reach. The storylines explain the background of the Blue Beetle and it's cute. The Reach in that plotline is very similar to Young Justice. Under my impression these episodes were helping to explain the plotline or at least foreshadow the upcoming events that will be in Young Justice: Invasion-Game of Illusions. SPOILERS- BLUE BEETLE has a lot more to do with the REACH.DC comics Trailer is big promo for DC Nation and DC shows for Green Lantern, Brave and the Bold, Young Justice to watch it and purchase their shows on DVD.DC hero's trailer is more personal and Involves explaining how DC comics is helping donate to the Hunger Crisis. It was a very deep trailer.Disk Two had Wondergirl and In red. It holds no special features. There is only play, episodes and languages to choose from. The format is the same.Young Justice Season Two took a major twist and shout from season one. It had a time skip of five years. Within the ten episodes not much is really elaborated on the past. We see Spitfire and apparently Conner and M'gann broke up. Since there is only twenty episodes in total the team managed to pull off the concept. The title Invasion reveals that it has something to do with aliens trying to take over the world. We see new characters to Young Justice good and bad. The characters have grown up and matured. There's still romance for the show with Wally and Artemis but we also see how there are more secrets. Secrets are a major turning point for Young Justice. There's a lot more action within the team and girl power and boy power. We've seen a major increase of female superheroes within the team. We actually see Tim Drake and Bart Allen come join the team. Those two along with Superboy were the first members of Young Justice based on the original series. The concept of the partner is very interesting considering all the mayhem we see. The original Roy Harper was found and then Lian appeared. There are too many characters but we learn new things. People complain about the characters but things change and it adds variety to the show. Overall the first ten episodes were very exciting. In my opinion it did very well to go with the major plot of the season. If the creators were given the time and money to elaborate on some of them they would but now Young Justice has officially ended.I recommend buying it if you enjoyed the series like I did. These came in hand during my trip to Florida and most of my friends enjoyed watching it with me. If you love the series then please help yourself. Now I really do not see a box season coming in. For ten episodes this was a little bit more expensive then I would have liked but I really wanted to support DC and I love the series. Currently on 6/30/2013 Cartoon Network has stopped showing reruns for Young Justice so I just bought it to be sure that I have this series. With timing and unfortunate funds this is the last season of Young Justice as of now. I bought it to always have the memory of my favorite show.",5,Young Justice-Invasion THELAST OF THE LAST,1372550400,"06 30, 2013",2013,4762,"['Young', 'Justice', 'Invasion-Destiny', 'CallingThe',

Sunderland,"[1, 1]","While I wasn't as impressed with this season as I was with the first, there is still no denying that this is one of the best animated series DC have had going in quite some time. My only real issue was the time jump. This season is set quite some time after the original and the core team has expanded exponentially. I got the impression this was the storyline the animators were planning for their fourth or fifth seasons and, having advance warning that the show would not be getting a third season, jumped forward to that point (don't know whether that's true or not, it was just the feeling I got from the early episodes). While this was not a problem storywise (indeed, it was handled really well, with clever reveals spaced out over the early episodes) I would still have loved to have seen how the team developed from season one to the time period set here.
