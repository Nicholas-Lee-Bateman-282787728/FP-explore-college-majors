This was my second time through this series, and had it not been for the Netflix remake of it I might not have watched it a second time. I'm glad I did, though.So, why not five stars? When something is this good, I have no choice but to compare it to truly great drama. And there, sadly, it falls short. What might easily have been soul-wrenching moral dilemmas instead become exercises in rationalization and denial. And it's exercise that produces very little sweat. (&#34;He: I had no choice. She: You had no choice.&#34;) In general, my fifth star for drama is reserved for those that engage not only the mind and emotions, but also the moral faculties or at least those parts of our decision-making apparatus (dare I call it character?) that are more than merely utilitarian. Great drama makes us look inside ourselves. If I can't imagine asking a classroom of high school seniors or college freshmen to watch it and then write an essay on what they would do in those circumstances, no fifth star.

379385,A2VE83MZF98ITY,6303542352,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[7, 8]","House of Cards, a BBC production done at the time of Margaret Thatcher's downfall, is one of the best modern political intrigue/satires done. The cast, the story, and the exacting attention to detail make this a piece worth watching and re-watching, to see what details escaped notice the first time.The PlotAs the story opens, Thatcher has just resigned. There is a brief glimpse of an inner-party election for a new leader, and the moderate, middle candidate Henry Collingridge wins the post, and proceeds to barely win the next General Election. Almost immediately following this event, tempers begin to flare as Urqhart is denied the promotion he had sought, and is disgusted with Collingridge's 'politics as usual' stance.Francis Urqhart, Conservative Party whip and functionary, with the unwitting assistance of a junior political reporter Mattie Storin, and the manipulated support of party functionary Roger O'Neill, sets out to undo the Prime Minister, involving the PM in scandals that rock his fragile majority and ever-loosening grip on power. Ultimately, Urqhart's schemes against Collingridge bring the PM down, and the stage is set for another leadership election.Urqhart, at the urging of his wife Elizabeth, works toward the leadership and works toward solidifying the loyalties of his minions, who include the ruffian Tim Stamper, an associate whip in the Commons, and Benjamin Landless, a newspaper proprietor. However, it is in making Storin his bedroom partner and virtual worshipper that Urqhart has his strongest support; this support is not absolute, something he recognises. This relationship is done with the blessing, nay, with the urging, of his wife Elizabeth.Urqhart uses his inside knowledge to make short work of all but the top contenders for the job, and then casts his lot for the job at the last moment, splitting the ticket. Knocking one contender against another one final time, Urqhart carries the election. However, O'Neill is unstable and unsure of the propriety of his dealings in bringing down Collingridge, and Storin realises at the last moment that she has been a pawn in a master political chess game. O'Neill's cocaine problem leads to his demise, as Urqhart plants poison in his drugs and permits O'Neill's nature to do him in. Storin discovers this murder plot, and confronts Urqhart, who confesses, but then proceeds to throw Mattie Storin bodily from the roof of the House of Commons.But, there was a tape recorder running, setting the stage for the sequel...`To Play the King' is the sequel, in which Urqhart matches forces against the newly installed King, played by Michael Kitchen. The King sees himself as the champion of the underdog and underclass Urqhart has abandoned, and it is a literal battle royale to the end. Storin has been replaced by Sarah Harding, who finds Urqhart is more than a match for her minor turncoating as well.Finally, `The Final Cut' brings things full circle, as Urqhart beats Thatcher's record of unbroken days in office. However, his lust for power drives him into reckless foreign affairs, and his wife comes into her own with scheming beyond measure.The CastIan Richardson is masterful as Urqhart, the scheming blackheart Chief Whip/Prime Minister. His voice, his subtle inflections and tones are perfect for the subtext in the words he speaks. His sidewise glances and knowing expressions to camera as the action plays out is worth far more than any words. He is a perfect snobbish, upper-class politico who considers political office as patrician right, and despises pretenders to the role.Diane Fletcher is superb as Elizabeth Urqhart, the equally manipulative wife. She is under utilised in this part of the trilogy, coming into her own as a character and an actress in later parts of the trilogy. One gets the strong sense of muted ambition and greed, but not amorality or power for power's sake from her, a distinction hard to play out on video. Fletcher succeeds beautifully.Susannah Harker plays Mattie Storin, the troubled, intelligent and inexperienced journalist who falls for Urqhart. Her psychological instability and intelligence are played beautifully. Harker can make quite a statement just with the movements of her eyes, making her a good counterpoint to Richardson.Miles Anderson plays the drug addict/party operative Roger O'Neill, doing a good job at playing the cad, the coward, and the fearful go-along with Urqhart's schemes. A rat trapped, O'Neill is at the breaking point, and Anderson plays this admirably.Perhaps the best secondary roles were performed by Alphonsia Emmanuel, who plays O'Neill's assistant and lover Penny Guy, and James Villiers, who plays Charles Collingridge, the deposed Prime Minister's troubled brother. Their roles shine brilliantly despite the relative lack of screen time.One gets the impression that everyone in British politics is brilliant and troubled. Well, the truth would be about half that.The Play's the Thing...This production, in writing and execution, is full of Shakespearean nuances. There are indirect and direct references to Richard III, and Urqhart is a Machiavellian manipulator in the Duke of Gloucester's image, recast for modern dress and situation, complete with stage whispers and asides to audience. The depth of the characters, while still remaining caricatures, is fascinating. Perhaps the best-known line for a while was Urqhart's attempts to get information out to the journalist Storin without actually telling her, and being guilty (by the letter of the law) for leaks and disclosures. She would hint and speculate, at which Urqhart would reply, `You might very well think that. I of course couldn't possibly comment.'John Major used this response in one of his own question-time exchanges, a use that was appreciated by the Members on both sides of the House.ConclusionsFor those who know nothing of British politics, this is actually a fascinating way to learn. For those who take an interest in British politics, this provides an intriguing fictional tale that is, in many ways, so close to reality on so many levels as to be positively unnerving.Richardson rightly won BAFTA awards for his portrayal of Urqhart in each of the three installments, House of Cards and its sequels To Play the King and The Final Cut. These sequels were possibly only because of a BBC change to Dobbs' original manuscript, which had Urqhart rather than Storin falling from the rooftop garden of the House of Commons.A bonus for the viewer.",5,You might very well think that...,1298505600,"02 24, 2011",2011,6493,"['House', 'Cards', 'BBC', 'production', 'done', 'time', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'downfall', 'one', 'best', 'modern',

379406,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,6303542352,mirasreviews,"[1, 2]","""House of Cards"" is a much-acclaimed BBC miniseries in four 55-minute episodes, produced in 1990, which originally aired just 10 days before Margaret Thatcher's resignation. It is based on the novel of the same name by Michael Dobbs, who, himself, had been an advisor to Thatcher in the 1970s and who was Chief of Staff of the Conservative Party just a couple of years prior to the publication of his novel. Remarkably, Dobbs remained in politics after its publication, serving in John Major's government in the early 1990s, despite his novels portraying politicians in a bad light. He seems to have been considered a smooth operator and should know party and parliamentary politics inside and out.Shortly after Thatcher leaves office, the Conservative Party elects the dull but well-intentioned Henry Collingridge (David Lyon) to be Prime Minister. The cunning Chief Whip Francis Urquhart (Ian Richardson) makes his recommendations for cabinet appointments to the new PM, only to find that the PM refuses to change the cabinet at all. Embittered by this bump in his road to power, as Urquhart wanted a cabinet position for himself, and with the approval of his ambitious wife Elizabeth (Diane Fletcher), he sets his sights on a loftier goal. Urquhart decides to be Prime Minister himself and proceeds to entrap, embarrass, blackmail, manipulate, steal, and generally make mayhem in pursuit of that goal. First, he becomes the confidential informant of an unwitting journalist, Mattie Storin (Susannah Harker), in order to strategically leak information to the public.Urquhart's machinations are sociopathically clever, even if he sometimes takes the crudest and most obvious route. Director Paul Seed has Urquhart speaking directly to the audience at times, I suppose to emphasize that this is his story and that he is all-powerful. I have mixed feelings about that stylistic choice. I dislike the conspicuous rat imagery throughout and the bird-hunting motif. They are painfully heavy-handed and clumsy. Seed must have made the right decision, however, in ending each episode with Urquhart saying: ""You might well think that...I couldn't possibly comment,"" as he is still quoted today, more than 20 years later.Though the plotting is clever and well-structured, I was constantly left wondering what the filmmakers mean by it all. Is it drama or comedy? Francis Urquhart is an evil person, but his schemes are too ridiculous to be credible. He's not appealing enough to be an anti-hero. There is nothing attractive about him at all. He's too clever and smug to be tragic. It seems that Michael Dobbs was making fun of politicians, as they are all made quite ridiculous. Urquhart's relationship with Mattie Storin is comedic in being so preposterous. The dialogue and narrative, taken in themselves, are black comedy. But ""House of Cards"" is ponderous at times and billed as a political thriller. I could never figure out if I was supposed to take it all seriously, which would be pretty silly, or if this is a comedy that completely failed to find the right tone.The only political comment that I found interesting was Mattie's casual use of ""Deep Throat"" as a nickname for her secret source, Urquhart, alluding to the source behind the Watergate scandal of the 1970s. Mattie is an ambitious dupe being used by a politically powerful source to remove someone from high office.

It's story tells little more than the ascension of Francis Urquart (Ian Richardson) from a ""party whip"" in British Parliament to the ultimate position of Prime Minister.  Schooled in the mechanics of parliaments' nastier side, Urquart outclasses those who stand between him and his prize. Aided by his wife, but finding much help in his rivals' wooden-headed resolve to play fair, FU is all but assured of triumph.  While political evils are normally excused based on their good intentions, Urquart's are so irredeemably blackened that you'll never doubt how evil a guy he is - associating himself with greed, the police state and, when that's not enough, Americans (the epitome being a loud and corpulent sod who, while Urquart has yet to become PM, discusses his plans for FU's government; to drive home what those plans entails, the villainous yank presses FU while halfway through a steak large enough to have come from 2 cows).  While FU counsel's caution, the only obstacle, ironically, is his love for a young journalist who has enough material to expose and bring his march on Parliament (like FU himself) to its knees.  Will the evil FU (who communicates to us the depth of his dark ways with an on-running soliloquy ala Richard III) succumb to love, or will he stay true to form?Though Urquart wears his evil openly, he and this multi-parter are actually full of surprises.  For his wicked ways, FU is probably the most compelling hero you'll likely see on ""Masterpiece Theater"", and, if you're not up on that show, ""House of Cards"" is probably your best excuse for watching it at least once.  Suggesting Shakespearean scheming and character-destruction (besides the ""Richard III"" monolog, there is Urquart's Lady Macbeth of a wife, while the young reporter with whom he courts love and his own destruction hints at a coupling of King Lear with Ophelia), the centerpiece is Ian Richardson as the smiling usurper-in-waiting who breathlessly outmaneuvers his clueless enemies.  (FU implicates the PM in a stock deal over new drugs his government certifies).  Never hesitating to tell us how much fun he's about to have, FU suggests that his audience is a whole lot smarter than the Brits over whom he's to govern, even though he ends up fooling us both. Only Mattie Storin, the reporter seems to have an insight into the real Urquart, and maybe that's why we're so eager for the mean FU to take action and win out over FU the good guy.
