From the very beginning when our heroine was called in to serve as an agent, I had a sense of doom. SPOILER ALERT*** After her first mission was successful, and when she was offered to be recruiting again, and inner voice of mine kept saying &#34;no, don't do it&#34; In the end she accomplished very little, except as a martyr to the cause of the allies. Violette Svabo was one of many women recruited, many of whom were captured, tortured and died.Apparently the British operations of this kind were not well-planned, and success rate was limited.Ultimately she is veiwed as a hero, and glorified as such. But her contributions were few, and her life ended ultimately without meaning. Perhaps she would have contributed more in life as a mother, in living to raise her child and possilby,remarry and have more children. The movie leaves me with an empty feeling. While I do agree that she was exceptional in making the effort, the problem remains that the so-called undercover missons were flawd and ill-planned.

1145698,ADQU6C7DE6VD2,B0014BJ1BI,J. Faulk,"[9, 15]","I wish that I could say this is a good film to the audience of today, but at 2 hours it's 30 minutes too long (the film consumes 50 minutes before it gets Violette to France on her first mission), an overwatered broth adhering to the straight-on conventions of the 1950s. The fear, suffering, and execution would have been too much for the 1958 movie audience, so the film limns them but weakly.Virginia McKenna (Violette Szabo) is a pretty young English woman fluent in French from her early years. In 1940, with war looming, she meets French soldier Alain Saury, they soon marry, and he has to return to the French army. Cut to their daughter's second birthday party, when Virginia receives the dreaded telegram about her young husband.Later she's approached by Special Operations to fly into France as a British agent. She accepts, and during her military style training meets officer Paul Scofield, and they drift towards romance. Their first mission to contact the Resistance is successful, but on her second mission she engages in a shootout with the Germans. She is captured, refuses to talk, and with two other young women is executed. (I've read that Michael Caine does appear momentarily in the glut of male prisoners on the train begging for water. And that, in reality, the three women were not executed by a spray of bullets as they stand but were made to kneel and shot in the back of the head.)This is all a true story from World War II. I was attracted to the film by a Supplement on the DVD of ""Peeping Tom,"" the screenplay of which was written by Leo Marks. He was a cryptographic expert in the war and was responsible for two very important concepts used by British agents in encrypting messages: a Silk Handkerchief, given to each agent, imprinted with columns of alphabet letters, and a Poem, unique for each agent, to be memorized and used in the coding process. The poem Marks wrote for Violette Szabo begins: ""The life that I have/ Is all that I have/ And the life that I have/ Is yours."" For the ""Carve"" film,  the historical truth is distorted so that Violette's Frenchman, her husband to be, writes it, and recites the poem to her as they recline on the grass; thus it acquires emotional weight and is used in several places in the film, and indeed brings it to a close. (I've read that Marks, in granting permission to use the poem in the film, specfied that his name was not to be mentioned; and that he originally wrote the poem on Christmas Eve 1943 for his loved friend after she died in an airplane crash while training in Canada.)Today, better the story of Leo Marks should be told, from his book Between Silk and Cyanide, and incorporate the many agents (such as Violettte) he strove to protect and save, and yes, there are ways to be truthful about the actual torture methods used by the Gestapo. As a second thought, a television miniseries out of England could be superb. (I've since discovered, and am watching, the 1987 series  Wish Me Luck, available from Amazon.)",2,Many British agents perished in Europe at war.

1145699,A1QCTBSO24KF4Q,B0014BJ1BI,John Chapman,"[6, 6]","This was an amazing story.  ""Carve Her Name With Pride"" stars Virginia McKenna as Violette Szabo.  Violette is the only daughter to her English father and French mother who married after meeting in World War I. She is the mother of a daughter and the widow of a French soldier killed in North Africa.  Since she is fluent in French, she is recruited by the British Special Operations Executive (SOE)to become a spy. She agrees to the hush hush duty telling her parents that she is just driving trucks from point A to point B.  While undergoing training, she makes the acquaintance of another SOE candidate played by Paul Scofield.  The two kindle a relationship and are eventually partnered in a clandestine mission to France which they successfully complete.  Prior to leaving on the mission she gets in a minor tiff with her father and she leaves the room abruptly. In the process, something drops from her purse. Dad notices it and picks it up. It's an English Army Parachutist Badge. Dad quickly realizes that his daughter is doing something much more hazzardous then ferrying trucks around. He returns the badge to her and promises not to say anything.  On a second mission just prior to the D-Day invasions at Normandy things go horribly wrong.  THIS IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY.  Violette Szabo was a remarkably corageous woman.  Virginia McKenna was nominated for a second BAFTA Award for Best Actress. She had won the previous year for her portrayal of Jean Paget in ""A Town Like Alice.""If you are a World War II history buff and want to learn something about a frequently forgotten aspect of the war, you will love this movie.
