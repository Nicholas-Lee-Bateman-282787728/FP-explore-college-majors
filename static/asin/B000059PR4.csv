574373,A1XSW26YGZB1X6,B000059PR4,Amazon Customer,"[19, 25]","Despite my revulsion at using such a phrase, the best summation I can give to this work is ""Fair And Balanced.""  Director Rodger Young somehow manages to present a view of the escalating situation in Idaho that is not tainted, slanted, or driven by a politically correct agenda.  There are no Bad Guys and no Good Guys in this docudrama.  (Although I might stretch a point to name as a ""bad guy"" Deputy Director Stagg, the supervisory US Marshal who, upon seeing Weaver's name on the front page of the newspaper, demands that the stakes be raised and armed tactical units be brought in.  This particular character gets all of 30 seconds' screen time, but I think it's far to say that, if Stagg's ego hadn't been so badly bruised by the thought of Weaver not being arrested for 18 months, that the situation could have stayed under control.)Working with a script by Lionel Chetwind, which was developed from the book ""Every Knee Shall Bow"" by Jess Walter, Young does a frankly amazing job of portraying the Weavers' early life together, dropping hints of racism, separatism, and some decidedly unorthodox religious viewpoints along the way --but none of it in a condemning manner.  Yes, Vicki and Randy were almost certainly not the sort of folks you'd want to associate with much, but for all the character flaws, NOTHING justifies what their situation came to.  In truth, the triumphant scene in which the family finally ""discovers"" the spot of land that will become their home SHOULD have been the end of the story.I've always been something of a Laura Dern fan, but my admiration for this actress's talent and professionalism is definitely raised a couple of notches by her portrayal of Vicki.  You see in her eyes the fervent belief and complete assurances that, while perhaps misguided, are certainly NOT out to cause trouble or violence --indeed, in the end it is Vicki who asks Randy to stop associating with the skinheads, and he is more than happy to do so, clearly not having been very comfortable with the association all along.  The disintegrating lines of communication between Vicki and the rest of her family is especially well performed and is particularly hard to watch.  As for Quaid, he manages to deliver the soul of a truly conflicted man, even from behind the exhausted eyes of someone who finds himself the number-one subject of discussion across America when all he truly ever wanted was to be left alone to raise his family.  Bradley Pierce puts across an absorbing combination of childhood innocence and hard-hearted bigotry into the role of 14 year-old Sammy Weaver, who, together with Jacob Davis as the younger version of Sammy, turn the character into an audience favorite by the time the Marshals open fire.It is when the family starts associating with area Neo-Nazis and Aryan Nations members that Kirsten Dunst really starts to shine in the story, absorbing the hateful propaganda and neatly tying it into the religious views in which her mother has diligently raised her.  The end result is both compelling and disturbing.  Darren Burrows also delivers a first-rate performance as Weaver family friend Kevin Harris, who manages to anchor Weaver to reality even as he lies bleeding and delirious.Another particularly compelling performance is brought to life by Bruce Locke, who plays FBI sniper Lon Horiuchi, who killed Vicki even as she held her baby.  Locke injects a sense of anger and naked revenge into the eyes of the sniper --this is a man who has chosen to interpret the already badly-explained Revised Rules of Engagement for himself, and all he can think about is getting even with the evil bastards who killed US Marshal William Degan.  Also worth a look is Joe Don Baker as legal living legend Gerry Spence of ""Silkwood"" notoriety, who manages to switch on some desperately-welcomed humorous moments in the movie's coda.  A few points of trivia: the works of Hal Lindsey (""Late Great Planet Earth"") are referenced early on in the story as being a catalyst to the shaping of Vicki Weaver's beliefs.  Longtime independent journalist J. Orlin Grabbe, one of the first to publicly denounce the FBI as domestic terrorists, appears as an extra in several scenes.In short, the movie does not flinch: Weaver was a loving dad and devoted husband, but was also a bigot and a petty thief.  The Feds framed him, botched the case, and overstepped their authority.  There are no excuses.  Nobody comes out of this story completely innocent and not a single tenet of Hollywood-style political correctness is observed.  No single scene truly emerges as the pivotal ""here's where it all went wrong"" moment.  Gary Graham's performance as a reluctant US Marshal is particularly convincing --here is a law enforcement figure that obviously doesn't want to follow up on this case and would happily let him be, but for the orders he is getting from above.  The movie takes us from one sequence of bad decisions to the next, ultimately revealing the real ""villain"" of the piece to be miscommunication.  The Marshals aren't listening to the local residents, Weaver's not listening to his neighbors, Vicki isn't listening to her parents (nor are they listening to her), the press isn't listening to the Marshals, the US Attorney isn't listening to the ATF case agent, and of course the FBI isn't listening to ANYONE.  It is only at the end of the action when Bo Gritz (excellently played by Bob Gunton) delivers the horrifying news to an agitated crowd that the ""villain"" reveals itself --and in one deft move, Gritz defuses the miscommunication, states the simple truth, and even calms down an unruly ready-for-blood mob.Did the Federal government learn its lesson from the tragedy at Ruby Ridge?  Well, of course.  You can just imagine the internal memos flying around: ""Next time, punch holes in the walls with tanks, flood the place with flammable gas, and then shoot anyone who tries to escape the fire.""Hats off to Hollywood for this effort, particularly to Quaid, Dern, and Young for delivering a product that tells the story without apology and never slants audience sympathies too far to one side or the other.  A clear warning trumpet that is very much worth renting or owning, regardless of your religious views, or where you think you fall on the political spectrum.",5,"No heroes, no villains, no political correctness.

574374,A3ATLB1PTCDK3X,B000059PR4,"Aron Rush ""missouri reb""","[2, 5]","Perhaps 10% of this movie is accurate. The caricatures in this film bear little or no resemblance to the Weaver family. I've always been angered by what TV and movies are allowed to portray as ""true"", but this horrible, vicious pile of bovine dung sinks to a new low. This family was attacked, terrorized and had members murdered by criminals with badges. The threat to public safety that justifid this? Failure to appear in court on a charge that was later dismissed. Big Brother government out of control is putting it mildly. They proved to any and all  who aren't brainwshed or deliberately hiding from an unpleasant dose of reality that if they decide they don't like you and want to take you down, they will do whatever it takes, spend millions of taxpayer dollars and even cold blooded murder. When atrocities of this nature cannot be hid from the public, the government propaganda machine demonizes their victims. It doesn't take much to get the average commodity obsessed American to put such unpleasantness out of their mind after the excitement of the ""news"" has worn off. And, hey, if the government spent all that time and money killing someone, they must've been bad and deserved it. If you aren't doing anything wrong you have nothing to worry about, right? At worst it was an unfortunate mistake, and besides, why did the Weavers have to live out in the mountains alone? Forget that just over a century ago Americans were doing just that by the thousands. This is now. Why can't you be like everyone else?What's really sad is so many people not only believed the evil lies spread about this innocent family, but think they brought it on themselve because they were supposedly neo-nazis. The Weavers were NOT neo-nazis or members of the Aryan nations as reported and repeated so often, but it would seem that too large of a percentage of Americans think it is okay to silence people who hold these unpopular beliefs by any means. For a ""fair and balanced account"" (to repeat a phrase used by fans of this cess pool of a film) read the well researchedAmbush at Ruby Ridge : How Government Agents Set Randy Weaver Up and Took His Family Down. Then you might at least try reading the Weaver's own account of what happenedThe Federal Siege at Ruby Ridge: In Our Own Words. So many of you have passed judgement on this family and continue to condemn them based on nothing more than seeing a TV program or reading something on the internet.

574375,A209QRVZ99UQDC,B000059PR4,Calamity Jane,"[5, 5]","Though not 100% accurate, this movie is engrossing. To those who know nothing about what happened on Rudy Ridge, this film is a great place to start. It will wet your thirst. You'll want to learn more about the day the government overstepped their authority and gunned down an innocent family whose only crime was wanting to be left alone. After shooting Weaver's son in the back, government agents shot Randy and Kevin, a long-time family friend. As Randy and Kevin ran for cover inside of the cabin, another agent fired through the open cabin door, striking Vicky, Randy's wife, in the head, killing her.Vicky Weaver wasn't the lunatic she was portrayed to be in this movie. Also, Randy Weaver is a short, non-threatening-type guy, nowhere near the size of Randy Quaid.Important facts are lacking in this movie, evidence that proved the FBI wanted the entire Weaver family dead. The book Every Knee Shall Bow (from which this movie was based)explains that the telephone offered to Randy was a ploy to get him outside where a robotic shotgun mounted on the army tank awaited to blow him away, or anyone else who came to retrieve the telephone. The FBI also knew without a doubt that Vicky was dead, and that one of their own had killed her. The microphone bugs they'd placed beneath the cabin floor picked up all bits of conversation inside. Hollywood easily could have included these facts in the film, but instead they used that time to wrongly paint Vicky as slightly mad.Hollywood also wrongly portrayed Weaver as a Klan racist. He was and still is a Separatist who wanted to live apart from other races. Though that attitude may invoke anger in some people, it isn't a crime to believe that. It's certainly no reason for the government to target the Weavers, set them up, hunt them down and kill them because of what they believed.Despite the inaccuracies, I loved this movie because it sparked me to learn more about the assault on the Weaver family. I hope it does the same for anyone who watches it.The DVD has no extras, no special features or interviews.

Well the answer is not good & you can see them on a collision course with an unhappy ending.Let's get to the bottom of this Right wing Ant Govt feeling.All of us in 1st world western countries can get get annoyed at our govt but we have avenues where we can channel our frustration IE voting,attending political meetings,working for a party or a person that beleives in the same things as you do,forming your own political party or if that is not enough run for office youself At local,state or Federal level.There is no excuse for people living in countries like the US to hold the anti govt views like the weavers did.Those that do should be booted out of the country & go to places like (if they even know these countries)China,Nth Korea,Iraq,Iran & coutless others where they can experiance for real brutal dictatorship & human rights violations by the truckload.We have all seen what happens when hatred of Govt,ignorence & intolerance gets mixed together- April 19th 1995 Oklahoma  169 innocent Americans killed.Enough Said",3,An Australian perspective,1039305600,"12 8, 2002",2002,2480,"['Having', 'just', 'recently', 'watched', 'TV', 'Australia', 'i', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'thoughts', 'movie', '.Firstly', 'am', 'not', 'expert', 'what', 'happened', 'here', 'having', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'subject', 'significant', 'media', 'coverage', 'so', 'knowlede', 'thus', 'far', 'been', 'gained', 'watching', 'movie.With', 'mind', 'i', 'know', 'been', 'portrayed', 'here', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'accurate.The', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'building', 'profile', 'Weaver', 'family', 'Christian', 'fundamentalist', 'beleifs', 'case', 'Anti', 'Govt', 'views', 'mixing', 'Neo', 'Nazis', 'own', 'kids', 'wearing', 'Swastikas', 'arms', 'teaching', 'hatred', 'kids', 'others', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'ie', 'non', 'whites', 'belief', 'can', 'never', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'guns', 'lying', 'house.The', 'family', 'become', 'isolated', 'even', 'Vicki', 'Weaver', 'parents', 'sister', 'views', 'things', 'end', 'world', 'know', 'are', 'too', 'much', 'even', 'them.Some', 'have', 'said', 'movie', 'unflattering', 'portrayal', 'Weaver', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'this.If', 'anything', 'i', 'found', 'too', 'much', 'skewed', 'FBI', 'ATF.The', 'issues', 'responsibility', 'Weaver', 'own', 'actions', 'are', 'not', 'addressed', 'here.What', 'when', 'man', 'wife', 'take', 'kids', 'isolated', 'location', 'have', 'little', 'contact', 'outside', 'world', 'teach', 'kids', 'hatred', 'others', 'own', 'govt', '.Cople', 'Fundamentalist', 'beliefs', 'blind', 'reason', 'understanding', 'others', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'share', 'views', 'Well', 'answer', 'not', 'good', 'can', 'see', 'collision', 'course', 'unhappy', 'ending.Let', 'get', 'bottom', 'Right', 'wing', 'Ant', 'Govt', 'feeling.All', '1st', 'world', 'western', 'countries', 'can', 'get', 'get', 'annoyed', 'govt', 'have', 'avenues', 'where', 'can', 'channel', 'frustration', 'IE', 'voting', 'attending', 'political', 'meetings', 'working', 'party', 'person', 'same', 'things', 'do', 'forming', 'own', 'political', 'party', 'not', 'enough', 'run', 'office', 'youself', 'local', 'state', 'Federal', 'excuse', 'people', 'living', 'countries', 'US', 'hold', 'anti', 'govt', 'views', 'weavers', 'did.Those', 'do', 'should', 'be', 'booted', 'country', 'go', 'places', 'even', 'know', 'countries', 'China', 'Nth', 'Korea', 'Iraq', 'Iran', 'coutless', 'others', 'where', 'can', 'experiance', 'real', 'brutal', 'dictatorship', 'human', 'rights', 'violations', 'truckload.We', 'have', 'seen', 'what', 'when', 'hatred', 'Govt', 'ignorence', 'intolerance', 'mixed', 'together-', 'April', '19th', '1995', 'Oklahoma', '169', 'innocent', 'Americans', 'killed.Enough', 'Said']",N/A

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[1, 8]","This extremely well done 2-part television mini-series ostensibly relates the true facts about the tragic incident that occurred in August of 1992 when Federal agents, armed with rifles, choppers and tanks, surrounded the Ruby Ridge, Idaho, cabin of White Supremacist Randy Weaver, who had resisted a Federal arrest warrant.Following an 11-day stand-off that brought nationwide attention, both Weaver's wife and 14-year-old son were dead.  Weaver, ultimately, surrendered, was tried on trumped-up murder and conspiracy charge and acquitted.Roger Young directed the film, which stars Randy Quaid as Weaver, Laura Dern as his wife and Kristen Dunst as their oldest daughter.  Also in the cast are Diane Ladd, Bob Gunton and Joe Don Baker.The problem with this docudrama is that there is nobody in the story that you really want to root for.  Yes, the Government abused their power in going after the Weavers with such deadly force.  The deaths were certainly unnecessary; caused by some trigger-happy agents.On the other hand, the Weavers were, indeed, White Supremacists who followed Nazi doctrines.  It is terrible that their family was destroyed and one can certainly grieve for them, but didn't they bring what happened upon themselves? Michael B.
