Worthy ""PlayinZsince87""","[0, 0]","If you've seen most of the episodes of the TV show, then you have probably seen the half dozen or so scenes on this video, nothing new.  If not you will find it moderately entertaining for 7 bucks.  There are a couple of tazer shots which are not exactly ""shots fired"", but whatever COPS is still the best show ever. ;)  Since I had seen all the scenes before the only saving grace was the uncensored dialogue scenes at the end which can be comical to watch.

They count tazing someone as shots fired. It is not graphic at all. The only good part to this DVD is the bonus section. Its about 10 to 15 minutes long and its how the entire DVD should have been done. I am training to be a police officer so I like this DVD just because of some training value it can give. If you watch COPS a lot you won't really like this DVD.,3,Its ok.,1094256000,"09 4, 2004",2004,460,"['saw', 'almost', 'episodes', 'TV', 'dont', 'even', 'see', 'shots', 'being', 'fired', 'hear', 'count', 'tazing', 'someone', 'shots', 'fired', 'not', 'graphic', 'only', 'good', 'part', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'section', '10', '15', 'minutes', 'long', 'how', 'entire', 'DVD', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'am', 'training', 'be', 'police', 'officer', 'so', 'like', 'DVD', 'just', 'training', 'value', 'can', 'give', 'watch', 'COPS', 'lot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'DVD']",N/A
792358,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00013RC02,Michael Crane,"[5, 6]","This is the DVD to own for any fans of the show, COPS.  It's packed with tension, danger, and violent confrontations.  &quot;COPS: Shots Fired&quot; contains some of the most dangerous confrontations to be captured on camera.  While it is actually really only a small taste of what the show has to offer, it still makes a nice DVD for any fan of the show.  Witness the police as they get called over to maintain and control dangerous and outrageous situations.  From people with knives to people with actual guns.  From drunken and violent perpetrators to deeply disturbed souls who feel there is no hope for them.  These men and women dressed in the uniform must make life changing decisions, and they have to make them fast if they don't want to danger the lives of innocent bystanders, or their very own lives.  It is a wild ride, and a ride that you will have a hard time forgetting.This is not for anyone who is extremely sensitive or who easily gets grossed out, as there is a lot of graphic content on this DVD.  You get to see exactly what a bullet wound looks like... and it's 100% real.  Some of this stuff you wouldn't be able to see on TV it's so intense.  I have always been a fan of the show, so I knew what I would have to expect.  However, that did not mean I had an easy time watching some of the things that take place on this DVD.A real downside is that this is really a short DVD.  Its running time is about 50 minutes, which isn't very long at all.  Considering how long the show has been around, I think they could've put together more material.  I wouldn't had mind paying a little extra for more content, and I'm sure a lot of other fans wouldn't as well.  There is a bonus footage section that gives you an uncensored montage that could never be aired on TV without it being watered down.  That's a little over 15 minutes, which is a nice extra.  If the actual program freaks you out too much, watching this section will help you relax some as most of the material is pretty humorous.&quot;COPS: Shots Fired&quot; is a nice package for those who are devoted fans of the show and crave for something a little more intense.  It's not a perfect or spectacular package, but it is a nice one.  Again, this is not recommended for younger audiences or for those with weak stomachs.  I hope to see more COPS DVDs in the future, as I really do love the show.  And maybe they'll put together a great DVD with hours upon hours of timeless material.  Until then, we have this, and that's a nice start. -Michael Crane",4,"&quot;Suspect is down.
