1442271,A3BI16TA7JQB8Z,B00555ZT7Y,Thad Komorowski,"[21, 25]","HERMAN AND KATNIP: THE COMPLETE SERIES contains 33 cartoons: all of the cartoons the characters appeared in that are part of the Harveytoons package. No credits, no openings/closings, and they'll likely look awful when you play them on your High-Def TV because they weren't mastered for it. One, DRINKS ON THE MOUSE, is censored. I cannot, in good conscience, give the set a five-star rating given these flaws. But actually including every single cartoon in the series (as well as two Katnip solo shorts), considering Classic Media's reputation for ""complete"" in the past, this release was better than anything I was expecting. Anybody who thought they'd be getting better for $6.00 is out of their minds.The series, while unremarkable, doesn't deserve the flack it gets, especially with the frequent comparisons to its highly regarded predecessor from MGM. True, there are few series as beautifully animated and funny as the original Tom & Jerry of the 1940s, but frankly, Herman & Katnip are at least on the same level as  the 1950s T&Js.; They're as well animated and written, and Arnold Stang's excellent voicework as Herman gives them a streetwise edge T&J; never had. The violence contained herein is no more 'disturbing' than what's seen in MGM cartoons either. How many times did Tom artlessly get his tail cut off as the scene's payoff or killed for the conclusion of the picture? What makes this brand of mayhem more 'acceptable' than when it happens to Katnip? The difference is nonexistent, frankly, and those arguing otherwise are kidding themselves.Any fan of classic animation has no excuse _not_ to buy this release. Marty Taras, Famous Studios's greatest and most recognizable animator, is predominantly featured in most of the earliest cartoons, and his drawing, posing, timing, and movement is as good as anyone's. This is likely the only release of these cartoons you'll be getting, so don't think a high-def edition remastered from the Paramount Pictures material is around the corner. Besides, whoever thought we'd _ever_ actually see a legitimate release called HERMAN AND KATNIP: THE COMPLETE SERIES?

1442272,A2OU43FBUB8OYD,B00555ZT7Y,VIC JAURIQUI,"[9, 18]","I've been periodically checking back on this Herman & Katnip dvd release (Paramount Pictures answer to Tom and Jerry).  I've been looking for a review from some insider who might have seen this disc, but nobody yet.  All I can say is I HOPE the cartoons are uncut, with the beginning/end titles intact.  Complete with the Harveytoons logo, the correct music, and no edits.  The running time for this disc reads 60 min.  How can that be?  The cartoons featuring this cat and mouse team would certainly run past that...like two hours, not one.  So this causes me great concern.  I bought the Harveytoons boxed set years ago from Sony, and these classic toons were chopped to pieces.  Why doesn't Classic Media respect these cartoons?  Well who knows maybe this set will be different.  Surprise us classic animation fans Classic Media!  Please don't disappoint us...again. UPDATE! the cartoons, as I previously mentioned, are edited.  That said, the original Herman & Katnip theme song ""Skiddle, diddle dee, skitddle diddle day, it's just like a holiday,"" is also missing from each toon.  But you can hear snippets of it in NORTHWEST MOUSIE,"" near the end.  Herman the mouse himself sings it in SURF AND SOUND.  My favorite is OF MICE AND MAGIC. with the cat and mouse battling it out in a magician's atmosphere. Magic does abound, especially at the end!  As usual, Winston Sharples gives a great score to each and every 'toon. He wasn't as well regarded as Scott Bradley at MGM, or Carl Stalling as Warner Bros., but his musical pieces are excellent. I believe thee are 33 cartoons on this disc for a running time of 3 hours, 25 min.  Arnold Stang provides the voice of Herman.  Stang went on to even further glory as ""Top Cat,"" in 1962.  For some odd reason he doesn't provide the voice of Herman in the final Herman/Katnip vehicle, KATNIP'S BIG DAY, from 1959.  Guess he was gone by then.  That cartoon, a this-is-your life-type  story, has all the characters, or rather his on-screen co-stars ribbing Katnip about various high-jinks.  Footage is shown from various cartoons.  Herman, and even Buzzy the crow are on hand.  Interesting and pleasing.  It does provide the complete series of the NO. 2 cat and mouse team of the fifties (7 time Oscar winners Tom and Jerry were No. 1), and the episodes are indeed enjoyable and fun to watch!",2,Let's hope Classic Media doesn't blow it!!,1312588800,"08 6, 2011",2011,2337,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'periodically', 'checking', 'back', 'Herman', 'Katnip', 'dvd', 'release', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'Tom', 'Jerry', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'review', 'insider', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'seen', 'disc', 'nobody', 'yet', 'can', 'say', 'HOPE', 'cartoons', 'are', 'uncut', 'beginning/end', 'intact', 'Complete', 'Harveytoons', 'logo', 'correct', 'music', 'edits', 'running', 'time', 'disc', '60', 'min', 'How', 'can', 'be', 'cartoons', 'featuring', 'cat', 'mouse', 'team', 'would', 'certainly', 'run', 'two', 'hours', 'not', 'one', 'great', 'concern', 'bought', 'Harveytoons', 'boxed', 'set', 'years', 'ago', 'Sony', 'classic', 'toons', 'were', 'chopped', 'pieces', 'Why', ""n't"", 'Classic', 'Media', 'respect', 'cartoons', 'Well', 'who', 'maybe', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'different', 'Surprise', 'classic', 'animation', 'fans', 'Classic', 'Media', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'again', 'UPDATE', 'cartoons', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'are', 'edited', 'said', 'original', 'Herman', 'Katnip', 'theme', 'song', 'Skiddle', 'diddle', 'dee', 'skitddle', 'diddle', 'day', 'just', 'holiday', 'also', 'missing', 'toon', 'can', 'hear', 'snippets', 'NORTHWEST', 'MOUSIE', 'end', 'Herman', 'mouse', 'SURF', 'AND', 'SOUND', 'favorite', 'OF', 'MICE', 'AND', 'MAGIC', 'cat', 'mouse', 'battling', 'out', 'magician', 'atmosphere', 'Magic', 'abound', 'especially', 'end', 'usual', 'Winston', 'Sharples', 'great', 'score', ""'toon"", 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'well', 'regarded', 'Scott', 'Bradley', 'MGM', 'Carl', 'Stalling', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'musical', 'pieces', 'are', 'excellent', 'believe', 'are', '33', 'cartoons', 'disc', 'running', 'time', '3', 'hours', '25', 'min', 'Arnold', 'Stang', 'voice', 'Herman', 'Stang', 'went', 'even', 'further', 'glory', 'Top', 'Cat', '1962', 'odd', 'reason', ""n't"", 'provide', 'voice', 'Herman', 'final', 'Herman/Katnip', 'vehicle', 'KATNIP', 'BIG', 'DAY', '1959', 'Guess', 'was', 'gone', 'then', 'cartoon', 'this-is-your', 'life-type', 'story', 'characters', 'rather', 'on-screen', 'co-stars', 'ribbing', 'Katnip', 'various', 'high-jinks', 'Footage', 'shown', 'various', 'cartoons', 'Herman', 'even', 'Buzzy', 'crow', 'are', 'hand', 'Interesting', 'pleasing', 'provide', 'complete', 'series', 'NO', '2', 'cat', 'mouse', 'team', 'fifties', '7', 'time', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'were', 'No', '1', 'episodes', 'are', 'indeed', 'enjoyable', 'fun', 'watch']",Herman and Katnip: The Complete Series
