1198499,AMX6OVOXFDL5Q,B001GP5TOK,Ben Masters,"[1, 1]","This is a release of the ""3 Greatest Games"" of the Oakland Raiders (who later became the L.A. Raiders, and are now once again the Oakland Raiders). The ""3 Greatest Games"" of this release are the 3 big Super Bowl wins that the Raiders have had in their history:  #11 against Minnesota in 1977, #15 against Philadelphia in 1981, and #18 against Washington in 1984 (the last one as the L.A. Raiders).In the first one, #11 against Minnesota (1/9/77 from NBC; played in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena), the Raiders won 32-14. Kenny Stabler was the QB. Fred Biletnikoff made 4 key receptions to become MVP. Curt Gowdy and Don Meredith were the announcers. The NBC logo here was a red and blue trapezoidal N which made its debut at the beginning of 1976 in the Orange Bowl of that year.In the second one, #15 against Philly (1/25/81, also from NBC, and played in the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans), the Raiders won 27-10. The quarterback for Oakland was Jim Plunkett, and he earned MVP honors by throwing for 3 touchdowns, the foremost of which was an 80-yd. pass to Kenny King on a third-down play near the end of the first quarter. Cliff Branch accounted for the other two, and both on opening drives: one to open the game, the other in the second half. Rod Martin contributed mightily on defense as well with 3 interceptions. Dick Enberg and Merlin Olsen were the commentators here, and this would be one of several that they would do for NBC (which also included #17 [Miami/Washington in 1983, from the Rose Bowl in Pasadena], and #20 [Chicago/New England, 1/26/86, another one from the Superdome]). Another thing you might not have known is that nos. 15, 17, and 20 were done under NBC's Proud N insignia (N with 11-feathered peacock). Since then, every Big Game that NBC has done (including the most recent ones, 43 and 46) has been with the current 6-feathered bird.The last one was #18 against Washington (1/22/84 from CBS, and played in Tampa Stadium in Tampa, FL). L.A. won this one 38-9 behind almost 200 rushing yards from MVP Marcus Allen (the actual figure was 191, which was a record then for most rushing yards in a Big Game). Allen's biggest run came near the end of the third quarter on a first-down play from the Raider 26-yd. line. There were only 12 seconds left in the third; Plunkett handed off to Allen, who was almost tackled but somehow reversed direction, and by the time the Washington defenders caught up, it was all over. Marcus went 74 yards to the end zone. There were big defensive and special teams contributors as well; Derrick Jensen blocked a punt in the first quarter and recovered for a score, and near the end of the first half, Jack Squirek intercepted a short Theismann pass and went in from 5 yards. Cliff Branch contributed a TD reception in the first half as well, making the L.A. Raiders the first (and so far only) team to score on offense, defense, and special teams in a Big Game, all in the first half. This was also the second Big Game that recently deceased CBS NFL play-by-play man Pat Summerall and color commentator John Madden did for CBS; the first was #16 in 1982, San Francisco/Cincinnati, from the Silverdome in Detroit. They would also do quite a few for FOX, and Madden himself would set a broadcasting record by doing at least one Big Game for 4 major networks (CBS, FOX, ABC, and NBC).The 3 discs of this release come in a keepcase that slides into a cardboard outer sleeve. The front artwork and descriptions and technical info on the back are almost the same on the sleeve and the keepcase (except that the keepcase does not have the DVD-Video logo, running time, etc.)The video quality is fair to middling on the first game from 1977, but improves with #15, with #18 in 1984 being of the best quality.One really annoying thing is that the same ads for other NFL Films releases (involving the histories of the Browns, Cowboys, and Dolphins) are on all three discs. I can understand having such ads on the first disc of a release, and of course they can be skipped over, but to have them on all three discs is quite unacceptable, and this downgrades the rating somewhat.I got this because I am an aficionado of how pro football and other sports were covered ""back in the day,"" as it were, and I think that, barring the technical faults and repeated ads, Warner Bros. and NFL Films have made a pretty good release of the 3 biggest Super Bowl victories of the Raiders, and one that I was pleased with spending my money on.",4,A pretty good release (albeit not flawless),1341705600,"07 8, 2012",2012,4478,"['release', '3', 'Greatest', 'Games', 'Oakland', 'Raiders', 'who', 'later', 'became', 'L.A', 'Raiders', 'are', 'now', 'once', 'again', 'Oakland',

As a lapsed Raiders fan (sorry, having Kim Jong Il's evil twin in power until his death in 2011 and his Commitment to Excrement through the '00s has turned me against them), the three greatest games in Raiders history are as follows:--1974's ""Sea of Hands"" divisional playoff game vs. the two-time defending champs, the Miami Dolphins--1976's AFC championship when the Raiders finally got over the hump and beat also the two-time defending champion Pittsburgh Steelers--1977 ""Ghost to the Post"" divisional playoff game vs. the Baltimore Colts that went back and forth as QBs Ken Stabler and Bert Jones put on a clinic for the agesor substitute with any Chiefs vs. Raiders battle in any era.This DVD claiming these are the three greatest Raider games is a joke. Just buy the box set that has the three Raider Super Bowl win highlight films as it also has league highlights for the year in that set.Forget this as these Uber Bore wins are not great games at all.

Here's what you should know:Super Bowl XI (Rating: 2 stars)  All of these Super Bowls were saved on tape, not film.  The quality is poor.  The picture is very faded and a bit blurry.  However, if you adjust the brightness/contrast and color level on your TV you can get a semi-decent image.  This is acceptable for Raider fans who do not have their own VHS copy.  One major flaw...near the end of the first half the Vikings are driving towards the end zone and the next thing you know, the Raiders have the ball.  Was there a punt, fumble, interception?  I don't know as that part is missing from this DVD.Super Bowl XV (Rating: 3 stars)  The quality varies.  About 80% of the time the quality is very good, however for an unknown reason about 20% of the time the image quality drops considerably.  This is annoying but for Raider fans, you can live with it if, again, you do not have your own copy.Super Bowl XVIII (Rating: 4 stars)  The quality is very good and the game is almost totally complete.

The video is fine (Curt Gowdy & Don Meredith) and the fades to and from commercials are much better than previous releases, but the NFL still refuses to put out complete games.  This particular game has roughly 14 plays missing from it (I lost count).One of the trickiest edits they put in was with 5:40 left in the game, the Vikings brought in their backup QB, Bob Lee.  They showed Lee throwing a pass, then cut to the sidelines, then they showed Lee throwing another pass.  The problem is that the second pass came with less than 2 minutes remaining in the game.  They cut out about 3.5 minutes of game time in between the two passes, which included an entire series by the Raiders.  Obviously, they tried to make this unnoticeable.
