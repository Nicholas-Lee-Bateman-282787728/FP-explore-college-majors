We all get older, right?As much as I love the series, and I always will, I think it's time to call it quits.

1251810,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B0026LYMHI,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[4, 4]","There are a couple of reasons why Jack Frost, played by, David Jason, scores high with me. First, I am 61 and I enjoy seeing an older detective solving cases.  Even though he may not be able to physically keep up with most everyone else, his brain is as sharp as ever, and he leaves everyone in the dust mentally.  Secondly, when he came as Del-Boy (Only Fools And Horses) to American tv-dvd, he completely won my heart for all time and it is hard not to like him in just about anything.There are three really solid mysteries here, which is a real improvement over the prior season. I'm looking forward to seeing this a second time as I really see so much more going on during a second viewing.If you buy the audio versions of the novels from the UK, you can get David Jason reading them.  You cannot get these from a USA seller. I've listened to the USA audio novels and they are pretty good.  I've read the print novels and they are pretty good too but there weren't that many of them so they are way, way beyond those novels in this series. I've noticed that Frost and Mullet have developed a grudging respect for one another this far along in the tv series.  Mullet has become more likable too.  That is NOT in any of the novels.  In fact, he is a bigger idiot in the novels than in the tv shows.  However, the author died after too few Frost novels so there's no telling where he might have gone with Mullet had he lived to tell the tales himself.",5,Jack Frost Is Still My Favorite Detective,1251676800,"08 31, 2009",2009,1452,"['are', 'couple', 'reasons', 'why', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'played', 'David', 'Jason', 'high', 'First', 'am', '61', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'older', 'detective', 'solving', 'cases', 'Even', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'physically', 'keep', 'up', 'most', 'everyone', 'else', 'brain', 'as', 'sharp', 'ever', 'everyone', 'dust', 'mentally', 'Secondly', 'when', 'came', 'Del-Boy', 'Only', 'Fools', 'Horses', 'American', 'tv-dvd', 'completely', 'won', 'heart', 'time', 'hard', 'not', 'like', 'just', 'anything.There', 'are', 'three', 'really', 'solid', 'mysteries', 'here', 'real', 'improvement', 'prior', 'season', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'second', 'time', 'really', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'going', 'second', 'viewing.If', 'buy', 'audio', 'versions', 'novels', 'UK', 'can', 'get', 'David', 'Jason', 'reading', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'USA', 'seller', ""'ve"", 'listened', 'USA', 'audio', 'novels', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', ""'ve"", 'read', 'print', 'novels', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'were', ""n't"", 'many', 'are', 'way', 'way', 'novels', 'series', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'Frost', 'Mullet', 'have', 'developed', 'grudging', 'respect', 'one', 'far', 'along', 'tv', 'series', 'Mullet', 'become', 'more', 'likable', 'too', 'NOT', 'novels', 'fact', 'bigger', 'idiot', 'novels', 'tv', 'shows', 'However', 'author', 'died', 'too', 'few', 'Frost', 'novels', 'so', 'telling', 'where', 'might', 'have', 'gone', 'Mullet', 'had', 'lived', 'tell', 'tales']",A Touch of Frost: Season 14

Indeed, David Jensen as Detective Inspector Jack Frost, his working partner George and his rather ""dim"" boss along with the whole working staff have acquired loads of grey hair and some extra poundage to go along with it.  In other words, everyone has aged on this (one of the longest running) British detective series. However, Season 14 shows all especially David Jensen, as Detective Frost to be in fine form.Season fourteen (14) has three episodes on two (2) discs with each episode running about one (1) hour and a half (1/2).  This season is marvelous with Frost remaining very feisty, short tempered with a very low tolerance for what is politically correct and absolutely no tolerance for any injustice to anyone especially the so-called ""down trodden"".  He does remain very ""dogged"" once on the trail of getting a solution to a crime; his determination to solve a crime is awesome.  In Season fourteen (14) he uses any means that he can use to solve a case (much to the chagrin of his boss).  He certainly proves that ""he still has it, no matter his age.All of the episodes in this season are ""nail biting"" being so well directed and acted.  Each episode features some unforgettable situations including a wayward and frightening clown and a murdering transvestite, naked streakers and severed pig head.

The writers gave him some great plots and dialogue to chew on--unless they let him ad lib--and he's his usual amusing self.In one episode, Frost is working on two complex crimes--both involving finesse which he doesn't like using. Some bodies are discovered in a burial spot that has connections to the pagan world. Is it a ritual crime? The press wants to know and a pesky occult author keeps hounding him. Another high profile crime occurs and his boss Mullett is worried about bad press. Will Frost use his charm? Not really. Frost, in his inimitable style, just blusters his way through, throwing caution to the wind. Of course, he gets results. He's inspector Frost. He's as funny as ever in this show--almost gets himself killed. I love treadmilling to these. Just put them on high volume and walk.Another episode involves two teen-age girls were murdered years before by a classmate. He is now getting out of prison, and the families are furious. Inspector Frost was a detective on the original investigation and he's not too happy about this either. But was justice done years ago? New clues come to light. This is a complex and dramatic episode. Loved it! The writing, plotting and acting just keep getting better in this series.A third episode is a suspenseful and riveting episode, but Frost's humor helps to keep the tension down. Late at night a bus is stopped and a crime occurs. There have also been trouble with young gangs on buses--are the crimes related? Frost and his team have to figure this out. Frost's banter keeps me in a positive mood.I love this series and this season did not disappoint.

ITV made specials throughout the years which appeared as series in dvd releases.  For instance they only made one two episode special this year.  Which will appear as a series 15 dvd next year. This may anger people; but that was it this year. One of the greatest weaknesses of British tv has been it's inability to make more episodes of hit series which would have insured greater revenues.  So all you get is three episodes here; but each one is movie length so that's really six episodes when they show it as a hour show.  Anyways; since ITV is bankrupt due to this low show volume problem and having them bankroll so many different series with different sets and locations it's no wonder that this; one of the all time best may not be around next year.  The three shows here are top notch; with Frost taking on a twenty year old case that involves child murder, a fleet street newspeddler and the murders connected to him and a kidnapping of a bus driver and his coworker.

There is quite an array of characters, all of them likeable in some way, even Supt. Mullett. But in this set the enthusiasm for the show seems to have waned a bit. Still good and worth owning but all of the key actors have aged and the writing is not quite up to par with the previous series. David Jason is still great and I would like to see more of Frost. But I think I read somewhere that he is retiring from the series, possibly this year. Without him the show would not be the same since he truly embodies the character created by R.D. Wingfield in his ""A Touch of Frost"" books. Again, a great series if you are a fan but if you are thinking of buying this as your first Frost DVD, go back and view the earlier series first.

RESTALL ""Robin Restall, movie buff""","[1, 1]","With Season 13, a single episode and an oddly weak one at that, it seemed as if the Touch of Frost series was fading out. Having to wait an entire year for a dvd cassette with only a single episode was anti-climax, and it made our household wonder whether Frost was going to end his life like Morse, teetering along at the rate of one a year until his author forced his boredom onto everybody and had the old fellow die. It was with a sense of relief then to find the 14th series of Frost containing three episodes. I have given the set four stars anstead of the five any true Frost fan would naturally give, because there is a somewhat erratic and frenetic quality about the first episode that leaves one feeling as if somebody, the director? has lost his grip. Its as if a new team of screenplay writers were cutting their teeth. Frost looked much older, and seemed to exaggerate a cranky, ratty and unfair nature to make sure we had not forgotten he does not suffer fools gladly - or might have come to think he is actuall a nice, slightly grumpy old man. The second and third stories are back on form and one is left only with a sad realization that indeed, whether anybody likes it or not, Frost will be retiring before long...  as will most of the supporting policemen! Let's hope that when that decision is taken, the producers (and the prinicpal actors) put their all into the entire season and go out with a bang.",4,Frost - back in from the cold,1252800000,"09 13, 2009",2009,1422,"['Season', '13', 'single', 'episode', 'oddly', 'weak', 'one', 'seemed', 'Touch', 'Frost', 'series', 'was', 'fading', 'out', 'Having', 'wait', 'entire', 'year', 'dvd', 'cassette', 'only', 'single', 'episode', 'was', 'anti-climax', 'made', 'household', 'wonder', 'Frost', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'life', 'Morse', 'teetering', 'along', 'rate', 'one', 'year', 'author', 'forced', 'boredom', 'everybody', 'had', 'old', 'fellow', 'die', 'was', 'sense', 'relief', 'then', 'find', '14th', 'series', 'Frost', 'containing', 'three', 'episodes', 'have', 'given', 'set', 'four', 'stars', 'five', 'true', 'Frost', 'fan', 'would', 'naturally', 'give', 'somewhat', 'erratic', 'frenetic', 'quality', 'first', 'episode', 'one', 'feeling', 'somebody', 'director', 'lost', 'grip', 'new', 'team', 'screenplay', 'writers', 'were', 'cutting', 'teeth', 'Frost', 'looked', 'much', 'older', 'seemed', 'exaggerate', 'cranky', 'ratty', 'unfair', 'nature', 'make', 'sure', 'had', 'not', 'forgotten', 'not', 'suffer', 'fools', 'gladly', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'think', 'nice', 'slightly', 'grumpy', 'old', 'man', 'second', 'third', 'stories', 'are', 'back', 'form', 'one', 'left', 'only', 'sad', 'realization', 'indeed', 'anybody', 'not', 'Frost', 'will', 'be', 'retiring', 'long', 'as', 'will', 'most', 'supporting', 'policemen', 'Let', 'hope', 'when', 'decision', 'taken', 'producers', 'prinicpal', 'actors', 'put', 'entire', 'season', 'go', 'out', 'bang']",A Touch of Frost: Season 14
