First of all, you cannot recreate or attempt to invigorate the classic Cheech and Chong.  Leave well enough alone.  I went into this with apprehension and was right; it was so pathetic.Cheech and Chong have so much going on here;  they role play as two men watching the stage show; they are two ""thumbs up"" critics, Chong does stand-up for a while; they rehash some great scenes from the classic ""UP in Smoke"", but seriously, that film is rather historic, leave it alone.  Plus, you will be privy to some behind the scenes nonsense too.  Then, they have a pathetic skit that they are two dogs, nothing funny, just disgusting.  Chong plays the role of a blind guitarist, and continuing to be bad is another lame skit is an old couple viewing a porn film, one telling the other what is going on.  Not funnnnnyyyy.Chong's wife Shelby has a small part in interviewing the two, plus she comes on, trying to lead the audience on.  She looks like some bimbette sleaze.Cheech reenacts his guitar playing rocker with the pink tutu. When you are old, you are old to remake any skit.  Folks, don't try this at home.I doubt this San Antonio audience even had laughs.  I believe their enthusiasm was just be see Cheech and Chong in their hometown.  They did not seem to be bursting with laughter as some reviewers said.Folks.... these guys need to hang it up.  YOU CANNOT RECREATE THE CLASSIC CHEECH AND CHONG......

In this filmed version of their 2009 reunion tour the dope obsessed duo are much older, thankfully no wiser and best of all, still funny. Trotting out their beloved assortment of crude characters, PEDRO & THE MAN, horny mutts RALPH AND HERBIE, blues singer BLIND MELON CHITLIN and tutu wearing glam rocker ALICE BOWIE among them, these raunchy, cartoonish routines will be familiar to fifty somethings jonesing for a nostalgic high; even SISTER MARY ELEPHANT gets in a cameo. Linked by emcee TOMMY CHONG's mellowed out standup comedy and the team's so-so backstage antics, some bits (LET'S MAKE A DOPE DEAL, an audience sing along of UP IN SMOKE) far outshine others (BORN IN EAST L.A.)...still, this is a vast improvement over their '83 concert flick STILL SMOKIN'.

I bought all their albums, which were then taken away by my father, so I bought them again. They were funny and we would all do their bits - DAVE'S not HERE! I even did my own version of ""Earache My Eye"" with my band back in the late 70's. These guys were COOL!!!Now here we are in the 21st century. We're not kids anymore, and with having been educated into the ""PC"" era a LOT of things we once laughed at just aren't funny anymore. They try to make fun of gays, cross-dressers, stoners, blacks, mexicans, and indirectly, blondes (Shelby). It just DOESN'T WORK. It ain't funny... why? Could it be that we've matured and are now more sensitive? Could it be that we aren't wasted? Could it be that they don't look the same, that because THEY are old that the lines don't work?I watched ""Up In Smoke"" again recently to try to figure it out. Yes, I've watched this movie about a THOUSAND TIMES and know ALL the lines. I don't laugh at it like I first did, but a LOT of it is still FUNNY!

I wish this would have been the way this... thing came off, but it didn't.The ""live show"" strung together with other bits that were supposed to be backstage or in the balcony were more of a distraction than anything else. I would say they ruined it, but that would imply that it could have been good without them. This is clearly NOT the case. This was BAD from the ground up.If you are determined to watch this in spite of my warnings, make sure you are under the influence of SOMETHING - anything!!!
