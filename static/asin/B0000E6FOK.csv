Was Taylor better than Buddy? Make no mistake, each player in this great DVD held his own. Taylor played a great slide.

Don't expect Eric to play flashy runs, the melodic style of him has taken over, but it was great.Sound is really tight, Mayall plays a great piano and harmonica, and sings as if he was 40.

Chandran ""vpcnk""","[2, 3]","frankly i was a bit apprehensive about this concert given the age of john mayall - but was totally in for a surprise. mayall's voice shows no sign of being affected by time and he puts on a great show.mick taylor (whose solo in the stones ""sway"", which i hold as one of the greatest solos ever!) disappoints here (maybe it is just that i expected too much!). eric clapton pleases, playing electrifying covers of both freddie king's hideaway and otis rush's all your love (but his singing of the cover of muddy's hoochie coochie man is almost embarassing - ""god"" pls restrain/restrict yourself to playing your guitar!). but the real surprise of the show is the new mayall guitarist buddy whittington who shows a rare feel for the axe (clapton is obviously nervous to share the stage and trade solos with him).so inspired was i by whittington's playing that i couldnt wait to play the dvd again to watch him play. he is a fantastic guitarist who more than holds his own in his duels with clapton. frank zappa is supposed to have said that most people wouldn't know good music if it came and bit them in the ass! it proves true here because while even clapton's mediocre solos evoke heavy appreciation and applause from the audience, whittington's inspired solos go almost unnoticed. a pity ...one cant help but wonder how the show would have been if the third member of the historical triumvitrate of axemen of the blues breakers - the great peter green - had shown up. well all we can do is wonder ...",5,surprisingly good!,1122940800,"08 2, 2005",2005,1500,"['frankly', 'i', 'was', 'bit', 'apprehensive', 'concert', 'given', 'age', 'john', 'mayall', 'was', 'totally', 'surprise', 'mayall', 'voice', 'sign', 'being', 'affected', 'time', 'great', 'show.mick', 'taylor', 'solo', 'stones', 'sway', 'i', 'hold', 'one', 'greatest', 'solos', 'ever', 'disappoints', 'here', 'maybe', 'just', 'i', 'expected', 'too', 'much', 'eric', 'clapton', 'pleases', 'playing', 'electrifying', 'covers', 'freddie', 'king', 'hideaway', 'otis', 'rush', 'love', 'singing', 'cover', 'muddy', 'hoochie', 'coochie', 'man', 'almost', 'embarassing', 'god', 'pls', 'restrain/restrict', 'playing', 'guitar', 'real', 'surprise', 'show', 'new', 'mayall', 'guitarist', 'whittington', 'who', 'rare', 'feel', 'axe', 'clapton', 'obviously', 'nervous', 'share', 'stage', 'trade', 'solos', '.so', 'inspired', 'was', 'i', 'whittington', 'playing', 'i', 'couldnt', 'wait', 'play', 'dvd', 'again', 'watch', 'play', 'fantastic', 'guitarist', 'who', 'more', 'own', 'duels', 'clapton', 'frank', 'zappa', 'supposed', 'have', 'said', 'most', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'good', 'music', 'came', 'bit', 'ass', 'true', 'here', 'even', 'clapton', 'mediocre', 'solos', 'evoke', 'heavy', 'appreciation', 'applause', 'audience', 'whittington', 'inspired', 'solos', 'go', 'almost', 'unnoticed', 'pity', 'one', 'cant', 'help', 'wonder', 'how', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'third', 'member', 'historical', 'triumvitrate', 'axemen', 'blues', 'breakers', 'great', 'peter', 'green', 'had', 'shown', 'up', 'well', 'can', 'do', 'wonder']",N/A
781508,A12S5XTMAHYYME,B0000E6FOK,Perry Celestino,"[37, 40]","Well like most Blues fans my age, I got the Bluesbreakers LP in 1966 and played it to death. I spent countless hours playing along with Eric Clapton on ""All Your Love"" and ""Hideaway"". They were great days. John Mayall has done so much to promote the blues world-wide, he can't get enough credit. Well, also like most people, after his time with Mick Taylor (""Crusade"") I stopped buying his records.This concert in Liverpool is very entertaining. It has a great song selection and the sound is good. Mayall brings out the old Bluesbreakers Eric Clapton and Mick Taylor (Why no Peter Green?) and they do a pretty good job. Taylor has a great tone and is as stone faced as ever. He is a matter-of-fact guitarist and plays well, especially on the Albert King number ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" -written by WDIA DJ AC Williams. Eric comes out and does a good job as well. He has been criticized for years as one who has stopped trying to be flash and has become more of a B.B. King-type of Blues player. He does ""Hideaway"" and ""Have You Heard"" and ""All Your Love"" from the original LP of so long ago. He uses his flashy Fender custom shop 2002 strat, too!The previous reviews have raved about Buddy Whittington (another Texan guitar player!) with his special Mesa Boogie amps and tone BUT. as a guitar player for 40 years I think the flash technique (volume control, pick harmonics of the 1970s rock scene), with very little soul or bending (no 1 Blues technique!!!) is ok, but not great for pure blues. Actually Buddy should get a job with Steely Dan or a Steely Dan tribute band. He is a great player, but seems to be one who bases his skill on speed and technique rather than feeling, which is what the Blues is, ""playing in between the notes"". However, I do like Buddy's reliance on one guitar- a  two-tone sunburst vintage 1950s stratocaster.John Mayall's vocals in is old age have improved (that is always controversial- I don't think him a really horrible singer). However, his harp playing is more like a blues Bob Dylan (Butterfield used to make fun of it!). It is pretty cool the way he plays simple harp and piano at the same time! But he should stick to organizing and arranging. All in all this is an historical concert and is very entertaining. It is a a great addition to one's DVD library.The highlights are ""All Your Love"", ""Have You Heard"", ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" and ""Hideaway"". John does a good job, but it is curious that with his lack of real talent on the harmonica he would do a tune about Little Walter as well as one of Little Walter's own songs.The sound overall is good and this is a very entertaining and well presented concert. Blues lovers both young and old will appreciate it. The price is reasonable and the lenght is good.

781509,A3006WHOAYJRLI,B0000E6FOK,Poogy,"[4, 6]","Some brilliant playing here and there, and a lot that's spotty.  I picked this up to hear Mick play and can't complain -- there's not much else of him available, and he's always worth hearing.  Many reviewers marveled at his playing here, but I have to say I've heard him play much better (in addition to his Stones stint, listen to Stranger in This Town, for example); here he too often seems like he's feeling his way along.  As other reviewers have noted, Buddy Whittington is at least as impressive as either Taylor or Clapton.  The latter noodles around a lot, although as ever he does eventually fire off some excellent riffs.  Here, as elsewhere, at his best -- slow blues -- he's as good as it gets, but otherwise he can be surprisingly limited. Whittington often looks as though he's very pleased to be able to demonstrate that just because he isn't famous doesn't mean he can't kick ass (I've seen him live, and this is even more pronounced -- it's really The Bluesbreakers featuring Buddy Whittington, he does so much showboating).  Mayall must be commended for being able to do what he does at 70, has a soothing voice and a charming manner and his harp playing, though not fantastic, is passable, but one has to wonder why he takes up space with  his amateurish keyboard and guitar when there are musicians of this caliber on stage.In short, for this price it's definitely worth buying and you'll enjoy it, but don't expect to be blown away unless you're a true fan of British blues.",3,"Comme ci, comme ca",1112400000,"04 2, 2005",2005,1496,"['brilliant', 'playing', 'here', 'there', 'lot', 'spotty', 'picked', 'up', 'hear', 'Mick', 'play', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'available', 'always', 'worth', 'hearing', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'marveled', 'playing', 'here', 'have', 'say', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'play', 'much', 'better', 'addition', 'Stones', 'stint', 'listen', 'Stranger', 'Town', 'example', 'here', 'too', 'often', 'feeling', 'way', 'along', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'Buddy', 'Whittington', 'least', 'as', 'impressive', 'Taylor', 'Clapton', 'latter', 'noodles', 'lot', 'ever', 'eventually', 'fire', 'off', 'excellent', 'riffs', 'Here', 'elsewhere', 'best', 'slow', 'blues', 'as', 'good', 'otherwise', 'can', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'limited', 'Whittington', 'often', 'very', 'pleased', 'be', 'able', 'demonstrate', 'just', ""n't"", 'famous', ""n't"", 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'kick', 'ass', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'live', 'even', 'more', 'pronounced', 'really', 'Bluesbreakers', 'featuring', 'Buddy', 'Whittington', 'so', 'much', 'showboating', 'must', 'be', 'commended', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'what', '70', 'soothing', 'voice', 'charming', 'manner', 'harp', 'playing', 'not', 'fantastic', 'passable', 'one', 'wonder', 'why', 'up', 'space', 'amateurish', 'keyboard', 'guitar', 'when', 'are', 'musicians', 'caliber', 'stage.In', 'short', 'price', 'definitely', 'worth', 'buying', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'blown', 'away', ""'re"", 'true', 'fan', 'British', 'blues']",N/A

Lot of better songs in Mayall's extensive songbook that could have taken their place.-- Not enough special features. Short interview with Mayall just whetted the need for more. Especially, as I soon turn 65, to hear the secret to how he's retained his physical and mental strengths.And not affecting the disc or performance, but I wish some of the performers had respected their audience with some thought to their dress. Mayall should have worn a sleeved shirt. Mick Taylor could have tucked in his shirt as well as taken off his rumpled jacket. Eric Clapton could have put something over his T-shirt. They all could have taken a lesson from Chris Barber. Yeah, I'm an old-fart stick-in-the-mud, and yeah, it really doesn't matter, but I submit that it does.A fine concert.

Seeing Clapton & Taylor on the same stage is pure magic. Eric must feel the need to show he's still got the ""slowhand"", because his playing here is 10 times better than any of his recent, more commercial albums (unfortunately Clapton's guitar is buried in the mix of several songs). The guitar playing on this dvd also reminds me of the ""guitar battle"" scene from the movie ""Crossroads"". The players just don't sit back and go through the motions (even Eric), they rip away with abandon and a sense of real competition. Not necessarily trying to upstage one another, but to show each other they mean business and have killer chops too. My favorite moment is during the solos of ""Blues For The Lost Days"".Buddy Whittingham rips off a solo with playing that would make Stevie Ray look down and smile. Mick Taylor's solo follows; and it's as if Mick is talking thru his Les Paul to Buddy saying ""is that all you got big boy?"". Taylor follows with a solo for the blues history books that ends with a ""fuzz-wah"" pedal flurry that left me stunned. Mayall's singing is also really good, better than most of his studio album releases.  The camera shots are superb  & the overall sound here is fantastic (with the exception of Clapton's guitar volume at times).So I get a little carried away! You almost have to with this dvd.

You could tell that John was overwhelmed by the reception from the crowd as well as sharing the stage with past and present Bluesbreakers and special guests. Mayall was especially pleased that Eric Clapton who was there 40 years earlier to kick off the Bluesbreakers dynasty made it for this special evening.The three key guitarists for this shindig were Clapton, Mick Taylor and Buddy Whittington(present guitarist with the Bluesbreakers). In my opinion, Buddy stole the show where the three were concerned but all performed in their own flawless styles. Buddy has since released a couple solo efforts since leaving the Bluesbreakers which are also worth a listen. The man is an amazing guitarist.For a man celebrating his 70th birthday, Mayall looked to be in excellent health and shape considering his lifestyle, 40 years on the road. He plays almost any instrument equally well and showcased his skills on organ, guitar and harp. The man is a blues master.I also enjoyed Slide trombonist, Chris Barber, who performed numerous tunes and solos during the concert. This is a bit unusual for this type of venue, but it worked for me. I thought it was cool.The evening was a celebration which showcased some of the best musicians on the planet. Mayall in my opinion always steals the show as he has so much command being one of the best frontmen of all time. His dedication to his craft is apparent but one thing Mayall always does is makes it a collaborative effort. He doesn't hog the spotlight and genuinely appreciates his co-musicians. This evening was all about the blues and everybody got into it.Mayall is still touring as I type this review and he is pushing 78-79 years of age I believe, and still blowing away the audiences.

I acknowledge that he doesn't have the best voice around (what blueman does?), but is there nothing he can't do?  In this concert he shows us all his talents. Whether it's playing guitar, keyboards, or harmonica, Mayall goes at it with the skill of a master and the energy of a much younger musician.  He even plays both keyboard &amp; harmonica at the same time!This concert has a good set list containing many classics, and a variety of sounds played by his own band and the guitar legends Mick Taylor and Eric Clapton, but also an old bloke (who I had never heard of &amp; can't remember his name now) playing surprisingly good blues on a trombone!All the guys Mayall has got together for this concert are consummate professionals.  None of them try to steal the show or compete with each other, which could easily have happened.  Instead they respect each other's talent, play their bit, and then step back and let someone else have their moment in the spotlight.  This results in a smooth flowing blend of sound.We all know how good these musicians are, but what you want to know if you are reading this review is whether they deliver the goods in this concert.  The answer is yes they do.  The quality of sound is fantastic, as is the picture quality.  The interview with Mayall is ok, but nothing fantastic.  However, the concert is a superb show that I recommend to any fan of blues rock.
