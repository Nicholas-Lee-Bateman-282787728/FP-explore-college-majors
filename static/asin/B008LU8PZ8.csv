Otherwise you get the typical Holywood humbug, which in this case, we got. Beyond the obvious problems that have been alluded to here, some issues are glaring, at least to those of us who have served. A writer elsewhere pointed out that one does not refer to SEAL team members as ""soldiers"". That's a sin. Obviously another team member would not use that term to reference a fellow SAILOR, or OPERATOR. Also, SEALs are not part of a ""squadron"", which, as the other writer pointed out, is a British, primarily an SAS, term. SEALs are members of boat teams. Also, as picky as it may seem, when the LT Cmdr, or ""Skipper"" of the team, was wearing his Navy blues, he wore his jump wings below his ""BUDweiser"", or Trident. SEALS wear their Navy/Marine gold jump wings below their ribbons. There were also a number of other tactical problems, but too many to mention here, not the least of which, as others have mentioned, was way too much Obama/politics and not enough of the real part of the story of actually getting bin Laden.

1570097,A3II0G0NLNIUT3,B008LU8PZ8,"Erin Fritz ""fritzilla""","[1, 2]","The movie has three problems.1)  Inaccuracy:  I've read and researched a lot about this event.  Unfortunately too much of the movie just doesn't stack up.  There are sources of information, even days after the event, that contradict what is shown on screen.  For instance that the president played golf that day while they were executing the operation.  Or that the helicopters used were secret stealth helicopters.  They also don't go into any of the things we found out after such as the controversy of never showing Osama's body.  Or that America left the doctor in Pakistan out to dry, for which he was subsequently jailed and tortured.  Or that the seal team all died in a mysterious helicopter crash a year later.2)  The Politics:  It starts off with clips that prop up Obama and edit clips out of context to make fun of Romney and other Republicans.  I found that off putting from the start.  Look, getting Osama was a good thing for America.  Many people contributed that are both Democrat and Republican, both in Obama's Administration and during the previous one.  This story is one for all Americans.  So to re-write history to prop up Obama was bad enough, but to then to take it further political with denigrating views of Republicans sort of infused a certain feeling of propaganda.  It certainly wasn't as blatant as the typical Michael Bay film, but it was unwelcome for something that is more of a documentary look at the event that America takes seriously.3)  The Experience:  The acting was well done, certainly better than that of a movie I love, Act of Valor.  So I give credit to the actors and the director.  However, the execution of the story just didn't do it for me.  I can't take too much away from the movie since it is supposed to be the retelling of an actual event.  Events don't package up all nice and neat like a 2 hour movie does.  And I don't want them to stretch or malign the truth any more than they already did.

1570100,A3RFXU3P0XKKF4,B008LU8PZ8,"Herbert L Calhoun ""paulocal""","[8, 13]","This movie, a masterful but understated portrayal of UBL's hunt-down and killing is about the most honest rendition of what it is like to work in the USG that I have ever seen -- period. The lead character is a CIA grunt who is bright, but not brilliant; a bureaucratic loner, dedicated to and living only through her work. She is one who keeps her head down and her antenna up.Working in a small group of Specialists without much supervision, it is the group's job to catch and kill UBL. No one else in the whole USG has this single mission assigned to them. That's it, literally: No road maps, no hardwired theories, just a small budget and blood and guts with your butt always on the line for instant results.  It is a heady cultural environment that can either drive you nuts or drive you to finding the right answers, which is what happened in this as in so many other less heralded cases. This movie reminded me of my group fighting the issue of small arms and light weapons at the United Nations.As this movie shows, working in the USG is a ""contact sport"" in which ""loaded dice"" are rolled daily. Any unit that comes up ""craps"" one time too often can and will be either shipped off to Siberia, or looking for a job the next day. It is always brutal, high-level work with low pay and even lower rewards, but when you are in the trenches, patriotic exhilaration takes over and you find yourself running on the fumes of history.Here in the aftermath of 911, the USG was never more highly motivated. It worked like a single mad organism. Ad Hoc groups popped up across the landscape, and a network of concerned bureaucrats from top to bottom found ways to work together. It was a no BS environment. Hunting down a single fugitive was and probably will always remain an iterative trial and error process: The best ideas, do indeed somehow finally filter their way up to the top. That is the nature of the process.Maya was stubborn, a common characteristic of people caught in the trenches between the proverbial ""rock and a hard place."" It was not just her intuition that told her that UBL's driver was the Holy Grail to locating him. It was also the logic in every piece of data she had ever collected for her entire brief career. Only the truth comes packaged in such a configuration that there is the kind of certainty she had.  Once she ""latched on"" to this thread, no one was going to ""talk her off of it.""Like a dog holding on to a bone, she did not let loose until she hit pay dirt.  After being ignored and mistreated for almost six years -- and was again being insulted in the very meeting where her efforts bore fruit. The chairman of the meeting was asked what she was doing in a high level meeting where UBL's house was displayed on a large screen? Maya finally got her revenge of sorts by answering that she was the MF who located that house on the screen? This, ""come back,"" will live in cinematographic history.I did not join the Katherine Bigelow bandwagon on the film where she landed an Academy Award, but I am fully on board this time, even though ZDT is not even one of the nominees for Best Film (go figure?)The torture in the movie, such as it was, not only was effective, but was also strategically sensible. It was not a case of a bunch of ""cowboys"" (like Abu Ghraib) out to have some fun, but dedicated CIA operatives who knew what they were looking for and were prepared to do what was needed (and nothing more) to find it. They did not succeed, but from where I sit, it was sure worth the try. If torture has to be justified, this portrayal of how it was done gets my vote, and I am profoundly against the use of torture. However, when it is announced to a prisoner : ""that If you lie, I will hurt you,"" the prisoner has been warned. They know the deal: All's fair in war.

The CIA&#8200;think they have located Bin Laden but clearly most operations can't be carried out on a hunch. The President does have to also weigh an unannounced attack on Pakistani soil.I liked the peak inside of how Navy Seals lived and trained.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[63, 68]","After watching ""Seal Team Six,"" I was a bit surprised to see the diversity in reactions to this well-intentioned teleplay.  I didn't really expect to see glowing five star reviews, but nor did I anticipate the vitriol with which others would respond to this piece.  Maybe it helps to know what you're getting into when approaching the DVD/Blu-ray release of ""Seal Team Six.""  This is NOT the eagerly anticipated and critically lauded (and soon to be Oscar winning) film ""Zero Dark Thirty"" by Kathryn Bigelow.  (Even that film, though, has its detractors despite unanimous critical acclaim).  Instead, this straightforward docudrama was produced and aired by the National Geographic Channel.  In no way does this constitute a definitive treatment of a difficult subject.  It just boils down the main events of a rigorous manhunt into a earnest summary.  It is a surface presentation of complicated events and judged on those terms, it works just fine.This little film is loaded with TV friendly faces that you might recognize.  Among the cast are Kathleen Robertson, Cam Gigandet, Anson Mount, Freddy Rodriguez, and Xzibit.  The movie attempts to introduce the Navy SEALs responsible for this life changing raid.  Much of the screenplay shows them interacting within their squad, but this footage is interspersed with confessional type sit-downs where each member of the cast gets a bit more personal with what they were thinking as the mission progressed.  With Robertson, we see some of the behind-the-scenes moments that initiated the raid.  Again, this is all presented in a documentary style that suits the lower budget of the project well.If you have an interest in this topic (and who doesn't really?), ""Seal Team Six"" presents an entertaining enough overview.  For its constraints and limitations, it is a nicely assembled film.  My hesitation stems from the fact that there is a slight difference between watching something for free (or renting it cheaply) as opposed to purchasing it for your collection.  Now that I have ""Seal Team Six"" on Blu-ray and have viewed it once, I'm not sure that it had the power or impact that will make me pull it out for a second look.

1570113,A30IP5D5DLHRPA,B008LU8PZ8,Kyle Slayzar,"[1, 3]","Have not see Jane Bigalow's film ""Zero Dark Thirty"" but I have read ""No Easy Day"" and, while I'm no SEAL Operator (military historian who teaches a course at Lake Region, it doesn't take one to realize several flaws in a military film or see it for what it is.Before I go into any real analysis let me just say that I am NOT a republican.  I, personally, find both parties to be corrupt, out of touch, apathetic to anything/anyone but the security of their own jobs, and other negative phases, metaphors, and adjectives involving several species of leeches.  I hate politicians, period, regardless of political affiliation.Now that THAT is out my system, let us begin.While I love just about any production shown on National Geographic (NATGEO) given their high production value and (usually) strong sense of objectivity, SEAL Team Six came off as a political commercial or pat on the back for President Barrack Obama.  The film dedicates its first ten minutes to barely mention information obtained from a detainee at Guantanamo Bay in 2002 and montages its way to 2010 with LOTS of clips showing President Obama defending his position on hunting for Osama Bin Laden while, curiously, only republican politicians slammed his position.This, the film could have done without and supplemented it with Presidents Bush and Obama talking about an ongoing hunt for Bin Laden or, God forbid, NOT bring in politics at all.  This would have made the first part of the film easier to be taken seriously as it blatantly came across as a political ad... especially given it's on-air release date of November 4th.  However, it didn't end there as the film kept reverting back to the political side showing Obama and Clinton watching a live-feed of the raid when no such thing happened (or so it was reported).  While many would see this as awesome given their political affiliation, it alienates others and, therefor, is not as appealing to the general audience.On to the film itself.  I could tell that the production crew were deeply in love with GoPro cameras as they were featured heavily and much of the on-screen footage came from GoPros.  BTW: when you're showing any camcorder footage as on-screen with the dates in the corner, be sure to keep it within continuity as one scene had 1-31-2011 dated in the corner and immediately cuts to a scene in Hampton Virginia with the dates October 28, 2010 front and center.  Either way, the constant helmet cams and GoPros, while fascinating, were used too much and were used to make the action seem faster when it wasn't.My next criticism involves the format of the film itself.  It self-labels itself as a docudrama, a highly dramatized documentary of sorts even though it's not.  SEAL Team Six presents this with a flashback format as the operators and players are detailing their experiences and feelings after the fact.  Never was really fond of that style as it takes away surprise as well as any riveting sense of excitement: it just goes on and on.  Indeed, SEAL Team Six is, for a lack of a better SAT term that critics love to use, boring.  While there was a little 'excitement' as an old school SEAL butts heads with a younger one he has to take orders from, there was little else.I tried to wait until the end raid and noticed several things that directly contradicted ""Mark Owen's"" account in ""No Easy Day.""  The raid on Bin Laden's compound was portrayed as considerably more... loud than the silent raid depicted in the book.  Granted the scene was still lackluster and failed to keep me on the edge but maybe the trick is keeping the audience on the edge by suspense, not action.  The filmmakers could have have accomplished as much by keeping it suspenseful thus making the film more enjoyable and keeping true with the historical accuracy.Next is the acting and in a word; bland.  While William Fitchner is a grossly under appreciated actor, the rest of the cast did not contribute anything decent.  They just read lines and the story went on.  Oh yeah, they had a rapper from MTV... applause?  Didn't think so.SEAL Team Six could have been a really good film as the production value was high but the story is a good one but for a myriad of reasons it just fell short.  It wasn't exciting, well acted, and tried too hard to push Obama in the spotlight, which is a total turnoff regardless of who the president is.  I don't care of Ronald Reagan comes back from the dead, sticks his head out of the UH-60 Blackhawk to remind the operators to ""Win one for the Gippur!""  It totally turned me off as did the rest of the film.I'm going to try and redeem my time by going to see Zero Dark Thirty tomorrow.  Hopefully, I won't contemplate seppuku afterwards for a double-whamey.",2,Docudrama or Political Commercial/Cartoon?

1570117,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B008LU8PZ8,Mark Turner,"[1, 2]","The raid that took place to kill terrorist Osama Bin Laden was standard procedure and put together not over hours but over years. As in the film ZERO DARK THIRTY the difficulty in simply finding him took a great amount of time. Once found, in a country that would have objected to our simply going in to take him out, the difficulty of capturing or killing Bin Laden was even more difficult. So why make a movie that appears to be a semi-action film when the real story took place behind the scenes?The plot line of the movie is simple and well known to most. Osama Bin Laden was the terrorist responsible for the attack on U.S. soil that happened on 9/11 where the Twin Towers in New York City were brought down by two jet airliners. The entire military and espionage organizations of this country then focused on capturing/killing Bin Laden who went on the lam for years before they could find him. Once found a plan was formed and Seal Team Six was sent in to capture/kill him. They did kill him and then dumped his body in the ocean. That summarizes the events and most of this film. But the film is 90 minutes long so we have to round it out with more.That rounding out goes from good to bad. As with ZERO DARK the movie tells the behind the scenes actions going on that led to the event. Some of these come off as believable and others come off as far from it. The other meat around the bones of this film is the fictional depictions of the men of Seal Team Six and the melodramatic problems that they have with the plans and with each other. With as compelling a story as they have to work with here, why insert this clap trap garbage to round out the film to 90 minutes?On the good side the acting here is well done with a number of good performances, enough not to single any one out. The production values seen on screen are also well done.On the bad side is the fact that this film feels rushed, as if it had to be put together and slapped on the screen as fast as possible. Thinking back to what was happening at the time that it actually the case. Some may choose to ignore the politics involved with this movie's release but it first aired on cable TV just before the elections of 2012. This could be considered a coincidence but the fact that the film was financed by the Weinstein brothers who supported President Obama, that the film portrays him in the best light possible and that there is the inclusion of a snip of Presidential contender Mitt Romney saying the war was over, even though he wasn't a part of any of the events happening here, makes it hard to believe there weren't political motivations to this movie not just being made but rushed to be seen.This is sad because in the haste of releasing this film all thoughts of making the best film possible seem to have been tossed aside. A number of people who are involved in the military or who have served found the depiction of the Seal Team deplorable. The schizophrenic feel derived from a movie that goes from melodramatic moments between soldiers to a depiction of how events transpired makes for a confusing and unenjoyable film.ZERO DARK THIRTY may not have been the most exciting movie about a military event ever filmed but it did offer a straight forward story that wasn't focused on doing little more than portraying the military as angst ridden co-workers or the President as the hero who came to save the world. It told the story of the men and women who worked tirelessly behind the scenes to make the capture/death of Bin Laden a reality.

It also shows the tenacity of the female CIA analyst (in reality: there was more than 1 female involved) who battled discrimination with her male colleagues in order to make the Mission a success.What I don't like about this movie is that the last few scenes were too hastily edited. I'm sure the soldiers did a lot more strenuous training and practice, and that the raid didn't last less than 5 minutes.I also don't like the FACT that the CIA and the Americans didn't perform satisfactory, if any at all, rescue operations to save their key human assets who helped them secure their Mission objectives. Those non-Americans were jailed, lives were lost and America doesn't seem to even care! Then again, this notorious American ""use and abuse"" trait seems to be in sync with their past historical treatment of their ALLIES in Indo-china during the Vietnam war. After the war, the Viet Commies massacred local American ALLIES with impunity and America didn't help them at all! All the Americans did was to spend time rescuing hookers to bring home.IF anyone can learn anything from this historical reminder: NEVER work for the CIA, or any agency, etc. unless you secure a good deal, and please don't rely on empty verbal promises of the CIA. When push comes to shove, Americans mostly care about themselves, then again, the same is true for all government agencies everywhere, they only care about themselves.If you've to get this DVD at all, buy a Region 1 DVD.

A break in the manhunt for Osama bin Laden serves as the backdrop for the story about a group of U.S. Navy SEALs who undertake to find the terrorist leader.Eight months of surveillance of the suspected bin Laden hideout reveals high walls, tinted windows, and barbed wire surrounding a two-story home and guest house.  Despite inconclusive evidence that bin Laden is inside the compound, and ignoring the possible ramifications of an unannounced attack on Pakistani soil, the Pentagon orders the attack.  SEAL Team Six bands together in the most daring military operation in a generation, completing their mission in a dramatic final showdown.Interpolated into the film is actual news footage of President Obama announcing the raid to the world, which gives the movie a documentary feel.  The movie parallels the plot of TV's ""Homeland.""  Both CIA analysts Carrie (Claire Danes, ""Homeland"") and Vivian Hollins (Kathleen Robertson, ""SEAL Team Six..."") have been determined to get their man since the 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers -- Carrie the fictional Abu Nazir, Vivian, bin Laden.The characters in ""SEAL Team Six"" have little depth and resemble  types prevalent in numerous wartime movies.  They tend to blandness.  What works, however, is the depiction of the long, often tedious hours, days, and months spent by teams of professionals in various areas.  The raid is the culmination of the work of hundreds of these individuals.The single bonus extra on the Blu-ray edition is the featurette, ""The Making of `SEAL Team Six:' The Raid on Osama bin Laden.""",3,A mission with tried-and-true military stereotypes,1356912000,"12 31, 2012",2012,1786,"['SEAL', 'Team', 'Six', 'Raid', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'was', 'first', 'shown', 'National', 'Geographic', 'Channel', 'early', 'November', '2012', 'attempt', 'beat', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'same', 'story', 'screen', 'break', 'manhunt', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'backdrop', 'story', 'group', 'U.S.', 'Navy', 'SEALs', 'who', 'undertake', 'find', 'terrorist', 'leader.Eight', 'months', 'surveillance', 'suspected', 'bin', 'Laden', 'hideout', 'reveals', 'high', 'walls', 'tinted', 'windows', 'barbed', 'wire', 'surrounding', 'two-story', 'home', 'guest', 'house', 'inconclusive', 'evidence', 'bin', 'Laden', 'compound', 'ignoring', 'possible', 'ramifications', 'unannounced', 'attack', 'Pakistani', 'soil', 'Pentagon', 'orders', 'attack', 'SEAL', 'Team', 'Six', 'together', 'most', 'daring', 'military', 'operation', 'generation', 'completing', 'mission', 'dramatic', 'final', 'showdown.Interpolated', 'film', 'actual', 'news', 'footage', 'President', 'Obama', 'announcing', 'raid', 'world', 'movie', 'documentary', 'feel', 'movie', 'plot', 'TV', 'Homeland', 'CIA', 'analysts', 'Carrie', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Homeland', 'Vivian', 'Hollins', 'Kathleen', 'Robertson', 'SEAL', 'Team', 'Six', 'have', 'been', 'determined', 'get', 'man', '9/11', 'attack', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'Carrie', 'fictional', 'Abu', 'Nazir', 'Vivian', 'bin', 'Laden.The', 'characters', 'SEAL', 'Team', 'Six', 'have', 'little', 'depth', 'resemble', 'types', 'prevalent', 'numerous', 'wartime', 'movies', 'tend', 'blandness', 'What', 'however', 'depiction', 'long', 'often', 'tedious', 'hours', 'days', 'months', 'spent', 'teams', 'professionals', 'various', 'areas', 'raid', 'culmination', 'work', 'hundreds', 'individuals.The', 'single', 'bonus', 'extra', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'featurette', 'Making', 'SEAL', 'Team', 'Six', 'Raid', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden']",N/A

Previously aired on the National Geographic Channel in November 2012, it is an interesting and action packed companion to the big budget version `Zero Dark Thirty'.In the now well published events surrounding the search, mission and eventual death of America's most wanted terrorist `Osama bin Laden'. A team of Navy SEALs are trained and dispatched to a compound in Pakistan, that the CIA believe houses bin Laden and his family.This version focuses more on the 'get in there and do it' aspect as opposed to the time spent looking for bin Laden in `Zero Dark Thirty'. This approach means it's not a documentary of the actual events, but a well made and entertaining action movie.The film has a lot of critics and government officials citing a long list of inaccuracies to the story, most likely due to its rushed release.On the downside, the power struggle between Gigandet and Mount and sub plot of the formers wife cheating with the latter - left me puzzled.As reviewed in the April 2013 issue of An Cosant&oacute;ir (The Defender) The Irish Defence Forces Magazine by Sgt Wayne Fitzgerald - dfmagazine.ie - military.ie",4,an interesting and action packed companion to the big budget version `Zero Dark Thirty',1364515200,"03 29, 2013",2013,1223,"['acclaimed', 'producers', ""'The"", 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'director', 'John', 'Stockwell', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'Previously', 'aired', 'National', 'Geographic', 'Channel', 'November', '2012', 'interesting', 'action', 'packed', 'companion', 'big', 'budget', 'version', 'Zero', 'Dark', ""Thirty'.In"", 'now', 'well', 'published', 'events', 'surrounding', 'search', 'mission', 'eventual', 'death', 'America', 'most', 'wanted', 'terrorist', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'team', 'Navy', 'SEALs', 'are', 'trained', 'dispatched', 'compound', 'Pakistan', 'CIA', 'believe', 'houses', 'bin', 'Laden', 'family.This', 'version', 'more', ""'get"", 'do', 'aspect', 'opposed', 'time', 'spent', 'looking', 'bin', 'Laden', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'approach', 'not', 'documentary', 'actual', 'events', 'well', 'made', 'entertaining', 'action', 'movie.The', 'film', 'lot', 'critics', 'government', 'officials', 'citing', 'long', 'list', 'inaccuracies', 'story', 'most', 'likely', 'due', 'rushed', 'release.On', 'downside', 'power', 'struggle', 'Gigandet', 'Mount', 'sub', 'plot', 'formers', 'wife', 'cheating', 'latter', 'left', 'puzzled.As', 'reviewed', 'April', '2013', 'issue', 'Cosant', 'oacute', 'ir', 'Defender', 'Irish', 'Defence', 'Forces', 'Magazine', 'Sgt', 'Wayne', 'Fitzgerald', 'dfmagazine.ie', 'military.ie']",N/A

Some of the details, no one except the SEAL team knows. Much is left to interpretation and speculation. My only peeve is that during the raid too much english is spoken and they didn't use silencers which are very common in the SPECOPS world. The critique about the trouble between the SEALS is overblown. These guys are run thru a very narrow sieve to find guys who can do this job. They are tough, smart dedicated and crazy. They train until they don't think about it. They make great sacrifices and have great egos that they must control. There is a pecking order and rank means little expirence is everything. They have the supreme discipline to be undisciplined! Still this is a very entertaining movie and should be viewed as well as any/all movies/books related to this operation. That is the only way to find any truth in this very secret operation.",5,Nice try!!,1358467200,"01 18, 2013",2013,1025,"['opinion', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'was', 'accurate', 'gestimation', 'how', 'SEAL', 'Team', '6', 'operates', 'mission', 'planning', 'background', 'stuff', 'related', 'operations', 'details', 'one', 'SEAL', 'team', 'Much', 'left', 'interpretation', 'speculation', 'only', 'peeve', 'raid', 'too', 'much', 'english', 'spoken', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'silencers', 'are', 'very', 'common', 'SPECOPS', 'world', 'critique', 'trouble', 'SEALS', 'overblown', 'guys', 'are', 'run', 'very', 'narrow', 'sieve', 'find', 'guys', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'job', 'are', 'tough', 'smart', 'dedicated', 'crazy', 'train', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'make', 'great', 'sacrifices', 'have', 'great', 'egos', 'must', 'control', 'pecking', 'order', 'rank', 'means', 'little', 'expirence', 'everything', 'have', 'supreme', 'discipline', 'be', 'undisciplined', 'Still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'as', 'well', 'any/all', 'movies/books', 'related', 'operation', 'only', 'way', 'find', 'truth', 'very', 'secret', 'operation']",N/A
