This movie is Directed to perfection by Carroll Ballard(The Black Stallion). He is one of  the most talented directors around. When he and Caleb Deschanel, the  cimomentropher, team up their is no better duo in hollywood. Caleb also did  The black Stallion.  this movie is one of the most beautifully acted  movies I have ever seen.  Jeff Daniels performs the dad with amazing  sensitivity and depth. this was his best and most serious performance.  Anna Paquin is phenomenol as the daughter. She captures the emotional shock  of lossing a loved one with what seems a minimal amount of effort. Paquin  herself seems to evolve with her character, as the film progresses. Paquin  proves that she will be a staying power in hollywood. Paquin has a natural  acting ability that few posess. Daniels and Paquin are the best  father-daughter duo to come around in a long time.  They understood each  other and their characters. They click the moment they are on screen  together. The film is wonderful and you can't help loving it. This film  reaches to a big audience and is definently an instant classic.  This is a  movie you will WANT to see many times over!

166740,A2F3SXHT6RBV81,0800187792,"Betty Burks ""Betty  Burks""","[1, 1]","This is the 'March of the Penguins' for a displaced group of Canadian geese, the flight of the birds.  Developers' heavy machinery scared the geese away from their nesting area at a lake on the property beside the home of a young girl played by Anna Paquin and her unconventional dad (a long haired Jeff Daniels).  Amy moved the abandoned eggs to their barn and kept them warm with electric light bulbs.  When the baby geese hatch out, they looked like Easter chicks, and she becomes their adopted mother.Since geese learn everything from their parents, from eating to flying (and where to fly), there is a problem.  When her dad remarked that it was amazing how they follow her about like that, the local deputy said it was called 'imprinting.'  He told them that the birds are possession of the Crown and tries to clip their wings; he's promptly ushered off their land, but he kept watch looking for his chance.They used to be declared an endangered species by the Wildlife Agency in America, but no more.  Animal Management can relocate a flock from one place to another.  I too had a group of geese who adopted me as their mother about three years ago.  But my pleas to the Wildlife Agency were in vain; the maintenance man at the apartment complex was allowed to harrass the group and shoot bottle rockets to hit them.As the fifteen birds grew up, looking now like their parents, and spreading their wings (losing the yellow downy feathers), Amy also started to grow up and learned to adjust to the loss of her mother.  While her dad and his friends work to perfect an experimental bi-plane (a glider with an engine), Amy devoted her time and devotion to her feathered friends, giving them names.  ""My geese are not going to have anything to do with your crazy ideas.""  They need to be shown how and where to migrate to the South for their own survival, out of harm's way.  They use the bi-plane to show the grown geese how to fly.  It seemed so perfect.The birds always returned to Amy's protection and so she did a daredevil stunt on her own to make sure they would follow her.  She learned to maneuver a flying machine sabotaged as a large goose so as to be able to lead them away.  The whole flock ""flew the coup,"" leaving behind Igor, the one with the damaged wing.  Of mine, the male leader had a crippled leg; I called him Jack because he was so ornery sometimes when the flock left him behind.  One day Igor attempted to join the flight but an accident caused them to leave the others unprotected while they searched for Igor.  The deputy abducts the other fourteen.A flight plan had already been mapped out to start on October 22, to get them in place by November 1st.  They will fly to Lake Ontario, then to Pennsylvania over the Appalachians, on to Maryland, and settle on the Virginia Shores, a four-day trip.  Amy is their leader after the dramatic rescue from the Animal Management's imprisonment.  They caused quite a commotion with aviation radar and security at the border in New York.  An entire military base was put on the alert because of the birds, with Igor riding in Amy's backpack while the others soar to freedom.Along the way, the flock (or gaggle) followed a huge group of wild geese into danger as it was open season at the ponds and lakes in America.  Because of the New York television publicity about this project, an old lady with a gun at the pond where they'd landed came to their aid; soon, they are airborne again.They caused havoc in the office buildings of downtown Baltimore as they glide a bit off course.  Amy is on her own for the last thirty miles after ther father's plane crashed.  The ground crew had gone on ahead and lost contact.  ""Fare the well, my own true love"" was like one of Sharyn McCrumb's Appalachian ballads, played as they landed at their destination, a new home for Amy's birds.  Truly a miracle -- this old movie (new to me) was much better than 'March of the Penguins' anytime.",4,The Birds Shall Reign Supreme.,1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,3946,"[""'March"", 'Penguins', 'displaced', 'group', 'Canadian', 'geese', 'flight', 'birds', 'Developers', 'heavy', 'machinery', 'scared', 'geese', 'away', 'nesting', 'area', 'lake', 'property', 'home', 'young', 'girl', 'played', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'unconventional', 'dad', 'long', 'haired', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Amy', 'moved', 'abandoned', 'eggs', 'barn', 'kept', 'warm', 'electric', 'light', 'bulbs', 'When', 'baby', 'geese', 'hatch', 'out', 'looked', 'Easter', 'chicks', 'adopted', 'mother.Since', 'geese', 'learn', 'everything', 'parents', 'eating', 'flying', 'where', 'fly', 'problem', 'When', 'dad', 'remarked', 'was', 'amazing', 'how', 'follow', 'local', 'deputy', 'said', 'was', 'called', ""'imprinting"", 'told', 'birds', 'are', 'possession', 'Crown', 'tries', 'clip', 'wings', 'promptly', 'ushered', 'off', 'land', 'kept', 'watch', 'looking', 'chance.They', 'used', 'be', 'declared', 'endangered', 'species', 'Wildlife', 'Agency', 'America', 'more', 'Animal', 'Management', 'can', 'relocate', 'flock', 'one', 'place', 'too', 'had', 'group', 'geese', 'who', 'adopted', 'mother', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'pleas', 'Wildlife', 'Agency', 'were', 'vain', 'maintenance', 'man', 'apartment', 'complex', 'was', 'allowed', 'harrass', 'group', 'shoot', 'bottle', 'rockets', 'hit', 'them.As', 'fifteen', 'birds', 'grew', 'up', 'looking', 'now', 'parents', 'spreading', 'wings', 'losing', 'yellow', 'downy', 'feathers', 'Amy', 'also', 'started', 'grow', 'up', 'learned', 'adjust', 'loss', 'mother', 'dad', 'friends', 'work', 'perfect', 'experimental', 'bi-plane', 'glider', 'engine', 'Amy', 'devoted', 'time', 'devotion', 'feathered', 'friends', 'giving', 'names', 'geese', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'crazy', 'ideas', 'need', 'be', 'shown', 'how', 'where', 'migrate', 'South', 'own', 'survival', 'harm', 'way', 'use', 'bi-plane', 'show', 'grown', 'geese', 'how', 'fly', 'seemed', 'so', 'perfect.The', 'birds', 'always', 'returned', 'Amy', 'protection', 'so', 'did', 'daredevil', 'stunt', 'own', 'make', 'sure', 'would', 'follow', 'learned', 'maneuver', 'flying', 'machine', 'sabotaged', 'large', 'goose', 'so', 'be', 'able', 'lead', 'away', 'whole', 'flock', 'flew', 'coup', 'leaving', 'Igor', 'one', 'damaged', 'wing', 'mine', 'male', 'leader', 'had', 'crippled', 'leg', 'called', 'Jack', 'was', 'so', 'ornery', 'sometimes', 'when', 'flock', 'left', 'One', 'day', 'Igor', 'attempted', 'join', 'flight', 'accident', 'caused', 'leave', 'others', 'unprotected', 'searched', 'Igor', 'deputy', 'other', 'fourteen.A', 'flight', 'plan', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'mapped', 'out', 'start', 'October', '22', 'get', 'place', 'November', '1st', 'will', 'fly', 'Lake', 'Ontario', 'then', 'Pennsylvania', 'Appalachians', 'Maryland', 'settle', 'Virginia', 'Shores', 'four-day', 'trip', 'Amy', 'leader', 'dramatic', 'rescue', 'Animal', 'Management', 'imprisonment', 'caused', 'quite', 'commotion', 'aviation', 'radar', 'security', 'border', 'New', 'York', 'entire', 'military', 'base', 'was', 'put', 'alert', 'birds', 'Igor', 'riding', 'Amy', 'backpack', 'others', 'soar', 'freedom.Along', 'way', 'flock', 'gaggle', 'followed', 'huge', 'group', 'wild', 'geese', 'danger', 'was', 'open', 'season', 'ponds', 'lakes', 'America', 'New', 'York', 'television', 'publicity', 'project', 'old', 'lady', 'gun', 'pond', 'where', ""'d"", 'landed', 'came', 'aid', 'soon', 'are', 'airborne', 'again.They', 'caused', 'havoc', 'office', 'buildings', 'downtown', 'Baltimore', 'glide', 'bit', 'off', 'course', 'Amy', 'own', 'last', 'thirty', 'miles', 'ther', 'father', 'plane', 'crashed', 'ground', 'crew', 'had', 'gone', 'ahead', 'lost', 'contact', 'Fare', 'well', 'own', 'true', 'love', 'was', 'one', 'Sharyn', 'McCrumb', 'Appalachian', 'ballads', 'played', 'landed', 'destination', 'new', 'home', 'Amy', 'birds', 'Truly', 'miracle', 'old', 'movie', 'new', 'was', 'much', 'better', ""'March"", 'Penguins', 'anytime']",N/A

The relationship between the two of them and Amy and the geese is hauntingly beautiful and so vivrant on screen. Mark Isham provides a sweeping soundtrack that will resonate in your mind for days.

I would just like to thank all those responsible for making the movie. It is a true joy to watch family movies like this at this time when families seem to be struggling to get along let alone work at a common goal. If Walt Disney were still alive he would have loved this movie. Walt produced a number of animal movies in the Sixties that are fun to watch even today. Inspired by a man that actually helped geese migrate you will not be disappointed in this story.Jeff Daniels as the Father and Anna Paquin as the daughter use Ultralight planes to escort geese on the right migration path. I can see that this movie will be a classic like the other great animal movies. If you enjoy family movies with a good story and aimed at helping animals, you will love this movie. The picture and sound quality are great. The price is extremely reasonable on the Special Edition version (twelve dollars and twenty-six cents), and it is a movie that should get a good deal of replayability for many years. I checked and you can not find it this reasonable anywhere else. I have seen it selling for twenty-two to thirty dollars everywhere else online or in stores.This is not to mention when you buy it you help support Operation Migration (operationmigration.org). Although the true story of how this all started is a little different, it is still a great one. The Special Edition includes a featurette and documentary that tells not only how they started this migration effort with geese but how they have now helped reintroduce Whooping Cranes to the East coast of the US. Buy it to entertain your family and help support a wonderful non-profit group that values wildlife. Be sure the box says Special Edition.

166745,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,0800187792,Chrijeff,"[1, 2]","My chief criticism of this movie is that it takes a while getting its feet under it, though it's understandable in light of the many personalities and situations that have to be established in the first half of the story: Thomas Alden (Daniels), an environmental activist and eccentric artist (mostly in metal) who lives in Southern Ontario; Amy (Paquin), his 13-year-old daughter, whom he hasn't seen in years, and who comes to live with him after her mother, a recording artist, is killed in a car crash in New Zealand; David (Kinney), Thomas's brother, and Susan Barnes (Delany), his lady friend; and assorted background information regarding the habits of Canada geese and the Dominion laws regarding them.  Spurred by the threat that the local wildlife officers will clip the wings of the hatch of orphaned goslings she has adopted, rendering them unable to fly, if she tries to keep them as ""domesticated,"" Amy resolves to find a way to help them migrate south each winter.  It's Thomas's friend Strickland (Graham), a hobbyist in ultralight flying machines, who provides a possible solution, but it takes Thomas's inventive mind to make the final link: because the geese have imprinted on Amy, they will only follow *her*, so a plane must be built for her and she must be taught to fly it.  (""You'll follow me,"" says Thomas, ""the geese will follow you, and we'll get them there."")  Complications are added by the fact that the wildlife sanctuary in Maryland where David and a professorial friend propose to settle the mini-flock is scheduled to undergo development if migratory birds aren't induced to go there within a very short timeframe.The best sequences in the movie are those that show Amy interacting with her flock--dashing across the lawn or the nearby field (on an ATV) with the whole band galloping frantically after her, sitting quietly in their cage with them facing off against an invading wildlife officer--and, of course, the flight south.  You'll gasp as Amy, Thomas, and their geese blunder into a downtown field of skyscrapers in a fog and go driving down the canyon between soaring high-rises, to the stunned amazement of office workers.  You'll be on the edge of your seat as they unknowingly throw a USAF base into full alert by bearing down on it without making radio contact.  The interpolated sequences featuring voiceovers and onscreens by assorted American newscasters add a sense of reality to the unfolding story.  And then there's the triumphant climactic sequence when Amy, left to do the last part of the flight alone after Thomas crashes his plane and dislocates a shoulder, arrives at the sanctuary where birdwatchers and environmentalists are staging a sit-down strike in front of the threatening bulldozers.  Besides sensitively addressing issues like divorce and parental death, ""Fly Away Home"" can also be seen as an allegory of growing up.

166746,A3DSTOJPRMV674,0800187792,"Chris K. Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[97, 99]","The multiple chords struck by Carrol Ballard's heartbreaking work &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; are so universal, it is difficult to imagine a person of any gender or any age not being touched in some way by this genuine family film. Make no doubt, &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; is a true classic, timeless in beauty yet timely in theme. So many subjects are tackled, from estranged family dynamics to environmental messages, it is difficult to fully grasp this film's important impact from just one viewing. Each time I view this movie, I come away with new ideas, and a new hope for our common man and woman.Film director Carrol Ballard has achieved such lofty heights before with his debut film &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; and his stunning follow-up &quot;Never Cry Wolf.&quot; Amazingly, he has once again climbed to the top of a very high mountain with &quot;Fly Away Home.&quot; The story is anything but simple, but its a tale of a mother, lost in a car accident, thereby forcing the reunion of a daughter and estranged father. He's an eccentric Canadian, living in the country, working on multiple sculptures and experimenting with flying machines. She's a lost soul, seemingly homeless without the guidance of her late mother. Yes, father (Jeff Daniels) and daughter (Anna Paquin) bond, but it's due to the nature which surrounds their rural homestead. In this case, an orphaned flock of geese Paquin raises from birth after the destruction of their natural habitat by encroaching development.Paquin's character becomes a surrogate mother for these geese, and eventually she must learn to fly to enable the lost birds to travel south for the winter. Daniels accompanies his daughter out of love, and eventually understanding that this has become a rite of passage for his budding, maturing teenage girl. And somewhere along the way, a girl becomes a woman, and a father becomes a man.Much of the credit for &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; goes to the brilliant cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, who also worked with Ballard on &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; and &quot;Never Cry Wolf.&quot; Certainly the musical selection of Mary Chapin Carpenter's haunting &quot;10,000 Miles&quot; is an inspirational if not brilliant choice. But the story is the key, and during a time of changing family dynamics amidst a society of shrinking nature, I can't imagine a film utilizing both themes with such skilled and relevant ease.&quot;Fly Away Home&quot; is such an important film, not only because a female protagonist breaks away from traditional bonds to find herself (no boy and his dog here), but because a self-centered man/father overcomes his weaknesses to find not only himself, but the person/daughter/child who defines his soul. &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; is about us finding our spirit during a trying time of divorce and misguided independent values. By bonding with the land, and as importantly with our family, we find our true spirit.And finally, &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; will bring a tear to the most hardened spirit, causing us to hug the ones we love, human or animal. Is that not the purpose of art - film, book, music or otherwise? I have applauded Carroll Ballard before. After &quot;Fly Away Home,&quot; I not only applaud this extraordinarily gifted director, I salute him.",5,"Yet must I not give Nature all, thy Art?",1046131200,"02 25, 2003",2003,3284,"['multiple', 'chords', 'struck', 'Carrol', 'Ballard', 'heartbreaking', 'work', 'quot', 'Fly', 'Away', 'Home', 'quot', 'are', 'so', 'universal', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'person', 'gender', 'age', 'not', 'being', 'touched', 'way', 'genuine', 'family', 'film', 'Make', 'doubt', 'quot', 'Fly', 'Away', 'Home', 'quot', 'true', 'classic', 'timeless', 'beauty', 'yet', 'timely', 'theme', 'So', 'many', 'subjects', 'are', 'tackled', 'estranged', 'family', 'dynamics', 'environmental', 'messages', 'difficult', 'fully', 'grasp', 'film', 'important', 'impact', 'just', 'one', 'viewing', 'time', 'view', 'movie', 'come', 'away', 'new', 'ideas', 'new', 'hope', 'common', 'man', 'woman.Film', 'director', 'Carrol', 'Ballard', 'achieved', 'such', 'lofty', 'heights', 'debut', 'film', 'quot', 'Black', 'Stallion', 'quot', 'stunning', 'follow-up', 'quot', 'Never', 'Cry', 'Wolf.', 'quot', 'Amazingly', 'once', 'again', 'climbed', 'top', 'very', 'high', 'mountain', 'quot', 'Fly', 'Away', 'Home.', 'quot', 'story', 'anything', 'simple', 'tale', 'mother', 'lost', 'car', 'accident', 'thereby', 'forcing', 'reunion', 'daughter', 'estranged', 'father', 'eccentric', 'Canadian', 'living', 'country', 'working', 'multiple', 'sculptures', 'experimenting', 'flying', 'machines', 'lost', 'soul', 'seemingly', 'homeless', 'guidance', 'late', 'mother', 'Yes', 'father', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'daughter', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'bond', 'due', 'nature', 'rural', 'homestead', 'case', 'orphaned', 'flock', 'geese', 'Paquin', 'birth', 'destruction', 'natural', 'habitat', 'encroaching', 'development.Paquin', 'character', 'surrogate', 'mother', 'geese', 'eventually', 'must', 'learn', 'fly', 'enable', 'lost', 'birds', 'travel', 'south', 'winter', 'Daniels', 'daughter', 'love', 'eventually', 'understanding', 'become', 'rite', 'passage', 'budding', 'maturing', 'teenage', 'girl', 'somewhere', 'way', 'girl', 'woman', 'father', 'man.Much', 'credit', 'quot', 'Fly', 'Away', 'Home', 'quot', 'brilliant', 'cinematographer', 'Caleb', 'Deschanel', 'who', 'also', 'worked', 'Ballard', 'quot', 'Black', 'Stallion', 'quot', 'quot', 'Never', 'Cry', 'Wolf.', 'quot', 'Certainly', 'musical', 'selection', 'Mary', 'Chapin', 'Carpenter', 'haunting', 'quot', '10,000', 'Miles', 'quot', 'inspirational', 'not', 'brilliant', 'choice', 'story', 'key', 'time', 'changing', 'family', 'dynamics', 'amidst', 'society', 'shrinking', 'nature', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'film', 'utilizing', 'themes', 'such', 'skilled', 'relevant', 'ease.', 'quot', 'Fly', 'Away', 'Home', 'quot', 'important', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'female', 'protagonist', 'breaks', 'away', 'traditional', 'bonds', 'find', 'boy', 'dog', 'here', 'self-centered', 'man/father', 'weaknesses', 'find', 'not', 'only', 'person/daughter/child', 'who', 'soul', 'quot', 'Fly', 'Away', 'Home', 'quot', 'finding', 'spirit', 'trying', 'time', 'divorce', 'misguided', 'independent', 'values', 'bonding', 'land', 'as', 'importantly', 'family', 'find', 'true', 'spirit.And', 'finally', 'quot', 'Fly', 'Away', 'Home', 'quot', 'will', 'bring', 'tear', 'most', 'hardened', 'spirit', 'causing', 'hug', 'ones', 'love', 'human', 'animal', 'not', 'purpose', 'art', 'film', 'book', 'music', 'otherwise', 'have', 'applauded', 'Carroll', 'Ballard', 'quot', 'Fly', 'Away', 'Home', 'quot', 'not', 'only', 'applaud', 'extraordinarily', 'gifted', 'director', 'salute']",N/A

It is testimony to the need for conservation in all countries.Finally, Fly Away Home is a family film that breaches the silliness that too many youth movies have evolved to.

Men are shown in their underwear in a couple of scenes, and there is an awkward scene in the bathroom after one character has taken a shower (nothing explicit).  The movie has a very strong pro-environmental theme throughout.

166758,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,0800187792,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[18, 19]","Before ""Winged Migration"", there was ""Fly Away Home"".  A 1996 film which was loosely based on the 1995 autobiography ""Father Goose"" by Bill Lishman.The film received positive reviews from many critics and audiences as the film would showcase a heartwarming tale primarily about family but something different was that this became the first Hollywood film to show the latest efforts in  migration for birds and also introducing audiences to the concept of ""imprinting"".  In other words, humans forming a bond with birds, geese when they are born and then raising them somewhat as a parent and then teaching them how to migrate and eventually increase their population away from harm.Taking on the directorial role for ""Fly Away Home"" is Carroll Ballard, known for his work with films such as ""The Black Stallion"" and ""Never Cry Wolf"" joins writing team Robert Rodat (""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""The Patriot"") along with Vince McKewin (television writer for many series such as ""The A-Team"", ""Knight Rider"", ""Dallas"").  Carroll Ballard known for his previous films that involve animals was back to directing a touching film about family, overcoming challenges and sticking together.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Fly Away Home"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and with an aspect ratio of 1:85:1.  As with most film created in the early-t0-mid-90's for Blu-ray releases, there is this softening effect that many tend to suffer from.  With ""Fly Away Home"", one of the positive aspects of the picture quality is that the film is shot outdoors and thus, you get a sense of the beauty of nature with the lush green and red trees during the fall, the green scenery while the aircraft is in flight.  Also, being in the air while the geese are flying.  Very good outdoor shots and vibrant colors.There is little softening effect during the indoor scenes but overall, picture quality is beautiful during the outdoors and many of the shots of the film are outdoors.As for audio, audio is presented in English and French via Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and Spanish 5.1 (Dolby Digital).  The film is primarily dialogue-based as the film is about conversations between father and daughter and daughter with family members.  But one of the biggest showcase for ""Fly Away Home"" is the music from Mark Isham.  Definitely creating a mood and the feeling of flight and beauty.  Definitely well-incorporated to the Blu-ray and sounds great.There is also good use of surround audio with the noise of the geese but overall the film is primarily a dialogue-driven film and the sound is quite clear coming from the front and center channels.SPECIAL FEATURES:For the special features included on the Blu-ray for ""Fly Away Home"", the features are in standard definition with English (stereo) audio with optional Spanish subtitles.  Features included on the Blu-ray disc are:* Director & Cinematographer Commentary - Commentary track by Carroll Ballard and Caleb Deschanel as they talked about the filming of the geese in flight.  Definitely a complicated film to shoot and finding the various locations to shoot the film and the ultra gliders was a challenge.  A very good commentary for those interested in learning how everything came together for the film.* Operation Migration: Birds of a Feather Featurette - An 18-minute about Operation Migration.  A company founded by Bill Lishman and Joe Duff in 1994, a non-profit charity organization and how they are migrating rare and endangered species in order to grow the population.  The featurette introduces the various staff members and also, unlike the film and other countries which the birds are introduced to humans, the organization now wears costumes, so the birds will not think they are human.  Very informative.* The Ultra Geese Documentary - A 49-minute documentary which the film ""Fly Away Home"" is based on.  The documentary features Bill Lishman and Joe Duff testing to see if they can treat geese new migration routes through the use of their ultralight aircraft.  Their goal is to restore the population of birds through new migration routes and showing us what actually really happened in their experience vs. what actually happened on the film.  The experiences that Lishman and Duff faced such as imprinting, the use of the ultralight aircraft,  having 18 birds with its leader Igor and losing Igor, having to contend with the Wildlife Bureaucratic Service and  more.  Very entertaining as Lishman and crew actually had a lot of footage of training the geese to flying with the geese and more.* HBO Making of: Leading the Flock Featurette - This 13-minute featurette showcases interviews with the director and the many talent involved in the film.  Especially how everyone were quite impressed with Anna Paquin's performance in the film.The Blu-ray is also BD-Live enabled.JUDGMENT CALL:""Fly Away Home"" was definitely an enjoyable, heartfelt family film that touches upon the real life activity of Operation Migration and what they are doing to help restore endangered species of birds and helping them migrate.  But what was even more remarkable was watching the cinematography of showing birds in flight and being so close to them.  Granted, bird cinematography has since evolved since this 1996 film with the 2003 release of ""Winged Migration"" and also ""Planet Earth"" but considering the challenge of filming this scene, Director of Photography Caleb Deschanel successfully pulled it off.  If anything, the nomination for ""Best Cinematography"" was definitely warranted.As for Carroll Ballard,  his name is  known for hits such as the 1979 film ""The Black Stallion"" and 1983 film ""Never Cry Wolf"", films that deal with animals (which he followed up with his 2005 film ""Duma"" about an orphaned cheetah) and sure enough, a good director to take on the challenge for ""Fly Away Home"" and trying to create this bond between a young character with an animal, in this case, geese.For younger talent, ""Fly Away Home"" definitely was a film that showcased Anna Paquin's talent as an actress.  Having won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress at the age of 11 (for the 1994 film ""The Piano""), Paquin definitely brought a character with a lot of layers.  A character having to deal with this new life, this father who she has never seen for years and then ultimately finding common ground thanks to her geese.Jeff Daniels does a great job portraying Thomas, this inventor/naturalist with his shaggy beard and long hair but doing a great job of portraying a father who is not too sure if he can take care of his daughter.  Credit to the writers who portrayed this family who really had nothing in common at first but eventually finding the common ground and eventually bonding through Thomas' love for flying and Amy's love for her geese and eventually, her becoming a pilot and sharing her father's enthusiasm.The film also stars Dana Delany.  Over a decade before her role currently in the TV series ""Desperate Housewives"", Delany was definitely known for her Emmy award winning work in the critically acclaimed Vietnam War television show ""China Beach"" during the late 80's and early 90's and a lot of her voice work for the Batman and Superman animated series.Some may feel that Delany was under utilized in ""Far Away Home"" but nevertheless, despite a short role, an important role of portraying the girlfriend of Thomas and for her character as Susan trying to get close to his daughter Amy (Paquin).If anything, the supporting actor who did shine in this film and definitely caught my attention was Terry Kinney as Thomas's brother David who brings a certain humor into the film as the uncle who is laid back but eventually comes up with major ideas to help the Thomas and Amy but most importantly, the geese.""Fly Away Home"" is a film that manages to hold up nearly 13 years later as a family film.  On Blu-ray, for those interested in migration of birds will love that the Blu-ray does features two featurettes and one lengthy documentary on the actual story that the film is based on.Especially knowing that certain things that happened in the film, happened in real life.  For Bill Lishman who co-founded Operation Migration (and in real life was the man piloting the ultralight aircraft with the geese), the leader of the pack for his geese was Oscar and similar to the film, Oscar was separated from the pack and was lost but eventually found.  But unlike the film where Oscar has a prominent part of being there with Amy during the flight, in real life, Oscar's return back to the pack of Geese was not an exactly enthusiastic return as the geese that he once lead turned against him.  So, it was an interesting segment in the special feature showing the relationships of the geese.So, my highlight was the documentary and also the informative special features included in this Blu-ray disc release and for those who enjoyed the 2003 film ""Winged Migration"", ""Fly Away Home"" was a film that definitely introduced many people to imprinting and new migration techniques.  In fact, ""Winged Migration"" on Blu-ray is being releaased on the same day as ""Fly Away Home"" and Bill Lishman had some involvement with that film as well.If I had any problems with the special features on the Blu-ray disc is that it doesn't include the isolated 5.1 Music Score with Composer Mark Isham's commentary which was included in the original 2003 DVD.  The music was an important part of the film and I felt the DVD showing a tribute to Isham's music was awesome.  But I was surprised it was omitted on the Blu-ray release.  But regardless of the special feature not included, for Blu-ray fans, it's all about the picture and audio quality and ""Fly Away Home"" looks and sounds so much better via high definition that the Blu-ray version is the definitive version to own.Overall, ""Fly Away Home"" is a touching, moving and enjoyable film about family and overcoming challenges.  And the film manages to accomplish portraying the family bond between estranged father and daughter but also showcasing beautiful cinematography that really makes this family film worth watching.",4,Blu-ray: A moving and enjoyable family film!

His &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; was based on the beloved Walter Farley novel and was  considered one of the best films of the 1970s.  He followed that film with  &quot;Never Cry Wolf,&quot; one of the best live-action films ever to come  from the Disney Company.  &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; is one of his latest  offerings, and as with his earlier films, it is a magical look at life and  nature through more innocent eyes.The film stars Anna Paquin, the young  actress from &quot;The Piano&quot; and the current young superheroine from  &quot;X-Men,&quot; as a young girl whose mother dies in a car accident and  who goes to Canada to live with her estranged father, an eccentric  inventor.  At first, the young girl is angry and reserved and shuns even  her father, but she slowly begins to rediscover a love for life when she  adopts a small flock of orphan gooselings.  The movie follows her almost  maternal kinship with the gooselings and the warming trust she begins to  develop for her father and how they eventually teach the geese to migrate  (hence the title fly away home).Anna Paquin is quite good in this film  and depicts a vulnerable side to her character.  She is certainly one of  the best actresses of her generation.  Jeff Daniels has an amusing turn as  a father who doesn't quite know how to deal with the new daughter in his  life.  Dana Delany (from TV's &quot;China Beach&quot;) also has a role as  Jeff Daniels' faithful girlfriend.  The overall film has a wonderful look  to it, and it was nominated for an oscar for best cinematography.  While  the film deals with some sad issues (death of a parent, the stages of  grief), it is nonetheless a truly enjoying film and one of the more  under-rated children's films from the 1990s.In fact, it is a pity that  more films like &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; are not made.  Hollywood tends to  produce so many tepid, painful-to-watch children's movies that the true  gems slip through our fingers.  If you liked &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;  or &quot;A Little Princess&quot; or &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; then you  will find much to like in this film.  All of these recent films are superb  family entertainment and were sadly overlooked.I watched this film on  VHS and fell in love with it instantly.  I would have bought it on DVD  except for the absurd decision on the film company's part to make the DVD  pan-and-scan only.  Any film that was nominated for best cinematography  deserves a widescreen treatment on DVD. So, by all means, watch this movie!  But if you want it on DVD for your collection, wait until the film company  regains its senses and offers the widescreen format.",5,Anna Paquin is sublime in this film!,963878400,"07 18, 2000",2000,2786,"['Carroll', 'Ballard', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'household', 'name', 'created', 'most', 'magical', 'children', 'films', 'few', '20', 'years', 'quot', 'Black', 'Stallion', 'quot', 'was', 'based', 'beloved', 'Walter', 'Farley', 'novel', 'was', 'considered', 'one', 'best', 'films', '1970s', 'followed', 'film', 'quot', 'Never', 'Cry', 'Wolf', 'quot', 'one', 'best', 'live-action', 'films', 'ever', 'come', 'Disney', 'Company', 'quot', 'Fly', 'Away', 'Home', 'quot', 'one', 'latest', 'offerings', 'earlier', 'films', 'magical', 'look', 'life', 'nature', 'more', 'innocent', 'eyes.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'young', 'actress', 'quot', 'Piano', 'quot', 'current', 'young', 'superheroine', 'quot', 'X-Men', 'quot', 'young', 'girl', 'mother', 'car', 'accident', 'who', 'Canada', 'live', 'estranged', 'father', 'eccentric', 'inventor', 'first', 'young', 'girl', 'angry', 'reserved', 'shuns', 'even', 'father', 'slowly', 'rediscover', 'love', 'life', 'when', 'small', 'flock', 'orphan', 'gooselings', 'movie', 'almost', 'maternal', 'kinship', 'gooselings', 'warming', 'trust', 'develop', 'father', 'how', 'eventually', 'teach', 'geese', 'migrate', 'hence', 'title', 'fly', 'away', 'home', '.Anna', 'Paquin', 'quite', 'good', 'film', 'vulnerable', 'side', 'character', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'actresses', 'generation', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'amusing', 'turn', 'father', 'who', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'how', 'deal', 'new', 'daughter', 'life', 'Dana', 'Delany', 'TV', 'quot', 'China', 'Beach', 'quot', 'also', 'role', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'faithful', 'girlfriend', 'overall', 'film', 'wonderful', 'look', 'was', 'nominated', 'oscar', 'best', 'cinematography', 'film', 'deals', 'sad', 'issues', 'death', 'parent', 'stages', 'grief', 'nonetheless', 'truly', 'enjoying', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'under-rated', 'children', 'films', '1990s.In', 'fact', 'pity', 'more', 'films', 'quot', 'Fly', 'Away', 'Home', 'quot', 'are', 'not', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'produce', 'so', 'many', 'tepid', 'painful-to-watch', 'children', 'movies', 'true', 'gems', 'slip', 'fingers', 'liked', 'quot', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'quot', 'quot', 'Little', 'Princess', 'quot', 'quot', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'quot', 'then', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'like', 'film', 'recent', 'films', 'are', 'superb', 'family', 'entertainment', 'were', 'sadly', 'overlooked.I', 'watched', 'film', 'VHS', 'fell', 'love', 'instantly', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'DVD', 'absurd', 'decision', 'film', 'company', 'part', 'make', 'DVD', 'pan-and-scan', 'only', 'Any', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'best', 'cinematography', 'widescreen', 'treatment', 'DVD', 'So', 'means', 'watch', 'movie', 'want', 'DVD', 'collection', 'wait', 'film', 'company', 'senses', 'widescreen', 'format']",N/A

Bernabo,"[0, 0]","Grant, the story of ""Fly Away Home"" is fairly predictable, in that we know full well that young Amy Alden (Anna Paquin) is going to persuade her father, Thomas (Jeff Daniels), to come up with a way of teaching a flock of adopted goslings how to fly and get them to a winter refuge in North Carolina. But predictability is not always a deterrent to a film being enjoyable or even inspirational, and you have to pity someone who cannot enjoy watching a bunch of baby geese running after Anna Paquin, convinced that she is there mother and therefore responsible for imprinting on them what they need to learn to survive. Besides, for what is ostensibly a children's film this one opens with a rather shocking scene, where we see a fatal car accident during the open credits while listening to a gentle melody. If there is anything that indicates this is more than your usual predictable children's film, this would be it.If there is a flaw in ""Fly Away Home"" it is that the relationship between daughter and father takes a back seat to the story of the geese, so that the pathos that exists there is almost lost in the flapping of wings (but there is a nice moment and a good line when the father tells his daughter why he know what she can do it). They two have been estranged by distance (he returned to Canada while his wife and daughter lived in New Zealand), and living together is not improving things. He is an eccentric artist and inventor who cannot figure out how to connect with a living human being until the geese that come between them bring them together.Fortunately, dad is spared the role of being the villain, because there are land developers at both ends of the flight and a wild life officer who knows what the rulebook says about domesticated geese. But those are just minor hurdles to the idea of flying 600-miles in four days in an ultra-light plane for Amy to lead her geese to their promised (wet) land. Yes, the idea that the clock is ticking and that bulldozers are ready to roll in North Carolina is all a bit much, but then there are moments, like when the ultra-lights and geese fly through the skyscrapers of Baltimore than just about take your breath away.I was not aware until after I watched the film that director Carroll Ballard and cinematographer Caleb Deschanel had previously collaborated on ""The Black Stallion,"" but that certainly makes sense because both films are perfectly willing to let pictures exist without dialogue. The other commonality is that ""Fly Away Home"" is another film that adults can enjoy just as much as the kiddies.",4,A young girl and her dad help young geese fly south for the winter,1144540800,"04 9, 2006",2006,2576,"['Grant', 'story', 'Fly', 'Away', 'Home', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'know', 'full', 'well', 'young', 'Amy', 'Alden', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'going', 'persuade', 'father', 'Thomas', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'come', 'up', 'way', 'teaching', 'flock', 'adopted', 'goslings', 'how', 'fly', 'get', 'winter', 'refuge', 'North', 'Carolina', 'predictability', 'not', 'always', 'deterrent', 'film', 'being', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'inspirational', 'have', 'pity', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'bunch', 'baby', 'geese', 'running', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'convinced', 'there', 'mother', 'therefore', 'responsible', 'imprinting', 'what', 'need', 'learn', 'survive', 'Besides', 'what', 'ostensibly', 'children', 'film', 'one', 'rather', 'shocking', 'scene', 'where', 'see', 'fatal', 'car', 'accident', 'open', 'credits', 'listening', 'gentle', 'melody', 'anything', 'more', 'usual', 'predictable', 'children', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'it.If', 'flaw', 'Fly', 'Away', 'Home', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'father', 'back', 'seat', 'story', 'geese', 'pathos', 'almost', 'lost', 'flapping', 'wings', 'nice', 'moment', 'good', 'line', 'when', 'father', 'daughter', 'why', 'know', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'two', 'have', 'been', 'estranged', 'distance', 'returned', 'Canada', 'wife', 'daughter', 'lived', 'New', 'Zealand', 'living', 'together', 'not', 'improving', 'things', 'eccentric', 'artist', 'inventor', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'connect', 'living', 'human', 'being', 'geese', 'come', 'bring', 'together.Fortunately', 'dad', 'spared', 'role', 'being', 'villain', 'are', 'land', 'developers', 'ends', 'flight', 'wild', 'life', 'officer', 'who', 'what', 'rulebook', 'domesticated', 'geese', 'are', 'just', 'minor', 'hurdles', 'idea', 'flying', '600-miles', 'four', 'days', 'ultra-light', 'plane', 'Amy', 'lead', 'geese', 'promised', 'wet', 'land', 'Yes', 'idea', 'clock', 'ticking', 'bulldozers', 'are', 'ready', 'roll', 'North', 'Carolina', 'bit', 'much', 'then', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'ultra-lights', 'geese', 'fly', 'skyscrapers', 'Baltimore', 'just', 'take', 'breath', 'away.I', 'was', 'not', 'aware', 'watched', 'film', 'director', 'Carroll', 'Ballard', 'cinematographer', 'Caleb', 'Deschanel', 'had', 'previously', 'collaborated', 'Black', 'Stallion', 'certainly', 'sense', 'films', 'are', 'perfectly', 'willing', 'let', 'pictures', 'exist', 'dialogue', 'other', 'commonality', 'Fly', 'Away', 'Home', 'film', 'adults', 'can', 'enjoy', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'kiddies']",N/A

Due to the geese natural instinct to fly south, and the fact that they don't have their real mother to lead the way, Amy with the help of her father attempt to lead the geese south in their own hang gliders.This is a very simple story done well, helping to create a pretty much perfect family movie. Jeff Daniels as Amy's father and Oscar winning Anna Paquin as Amy are equally fantastic, and I'd also like to give a shout out to Terry Kinney as Amy's uncle who is really quite funny. The directing by Carroll Ballard is brilliant and the cinematography is breathtaking and makes you feel like you are flying with Amy, her Dad and the geese. Not to mention the truly inspirational score by Mark Isham that is helping us along on our journey.The DVD special features which although not necessarily entertaining are appropriately informative. And also, &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; has been digitally remastered and is presented in widescreen, so it's the best you'll see this movie.

166786,A129YBX5BVNW2,0800187792,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[0, 0]","It begins in New Zealand with windscreen wipers washing away rain. A mother in her mid thirties is driving her 13-year old daughter home at night to Pukekohe. Amy Alden (Anna Paquin) is listening to music on her headphones - smiling lovingly at her cool mum who looks over at her spirited girl with pride. But as a beautiful and inspirational piano theme plays (""10,000 Miles"" by Mary Chapin Carpenter - a Robbie Burns poem put to music) - a truck approaches just when Mummy is taking an ill-timed mobile phonecall. She swerves fast to avoid the oncoming juggernaut but flips the car in doing so. It rolls to a shattered stand still - paramedics pull only the injured Amy from the wreckage. Her father Thomas then comes all the way from Ontario to bring his traumatized daughter home (they parted when she was three).Thomas Alden (Jeff Daniels) is an upbeat force - a self-made man - a Canadian dreamer, sculptor and madcap inventor - obsessed with flight, hang gliders and ultralight trikes (he's even built an exact replica of the Moon Lander in his barn because the Earth no longer has one). And where Dad lives is beautiful - rural woodland and rolling hills surrounds his farmstead. But developers covet the land and one-day after bulldozers have illegally knocked down trees and natural habitat - Amy is out surveying the carnage. She spots a batch of goose eggs thrown by the dozers that haven't hatched yet. Gathering all 16 in a pouch - she carefully places them in a disused cabinet in the hay barn - using straw as a bed and her mother's old clothes as wraps. To keep them warm in the closed wooden drawer - she steals one of Dad's old mobile lamps (when he's not looking) and then hops the yellow bus to school. Busy sculpting a commission of a bronze Dragon - Dad hasn't noticed the deep bond that's going on in the barn. But then they hatch into goslings and soon the little fuzzballs are all over the kitchen table squawking, eating, pooping and following Amy wherever she goes.As they grow - Dad realizes he's at sea with those gorgeous but needy creatures - so he seeks advise. A local sheriff who knows something of their habits comes calling and explains. 'Imprinting' means that Canadian Wild Geese will follow anything and anyone they see after their born and presume them to be their mother. They migrate South each year come late Fall to the wetlands for warmth and abundant food (as they've done for millennium). Their mother will show them the way and they'll return in the spring to the exact same spot. Unfortunately as per the law - domestic birds must have their wings clipped so they don't fly away. But when Glen tries to engage in the act of 'pining' as per Ordinance 9314 - Amy goes berserk and hits him with a frying pan.Dad, his lovely girlfriend Susan (Dana Delany), the recently arrived brainbox Uncle Dave (Terry Kinney) and local mechanical help Barry (Holter Graham) all now collude. Inventor Thomas realizes that as the geese fly at 31 miles per hour and view Amy as their mother - they could theoretically follow her in a specially modified ultralight. So the building of small planes and the imprint training of the geese begin in earnest for the arduous marathon ahead. Soon the Canadian media and even the military at Niagara Air Force Base become involved as the now 14-year old Amy engages in her epic 5000-mile flight home with Igor (one who has difficulty flying), chaperone Dad in a second ultralight trailing behind and the other 15 birds flying alongside ""Mama Goose"". They become a cause celebre and Amy an environmental hero...It's hardly surprising that Caleb Deschanel won the Oscar for cinematography - because ""Fly Away Home"" is a looker to say the least. As you can imagine the up close and personal shots of hatching chicks and fluffy mites would melt a heart of stone. Fully extended wingspans of gracious birds landing in slow motion on spring ponds, glorious Canadian dawns as Dad tries out his latest whacko flying machine, aerial shots that look down on Amy's imitation goose ultralight with Autumn coloured terrain below as her trusting flock accompany her home - gorgeous stuff. Even a memory of Mum pushing Amy on the swing in the barn is beautifully rendered.The American BLU RAY (Barcode 0433962955346) is REGION ABC (Region Free) so no compatibility issues for any buyers. The picture is fabulous and combined with Mark Isham's sweeping score - the effect is magical in a truly cinematic way. It's defaulted to 1.85:1 - Full Screen Aspect Ratio  - giving you the full visual whack. The Audio offers English, French and Spanish Dolby TrueHD 5.1 while the Extras include pieces on the autobiography of Bill Lishman (who actually did fly with geese in his tiny biplane), interviews with the principal actors and Californian Director Carroll Ballard discussing how he worked with Robert Rodat and Vince McKewin on the adapted screenplay. It's pleasingly indepth and newly informative - even after you've watched the film.But this would all amount to naught if the movie didn't work on a deeply parental level - and ""Fly Away Home"" does. I saw this at the cinema and there were mums and dads clutching their kids and bawling like big girl's blouses. By the time Mary Chapin Carpenter's stunning musical rendition of ""10,000 Miles"" returns (it's on her 1998 hits CD ""Party Doll And Other Favorites"") as Amy nears her destination with thousands waiting anxiously for her to appear on the horizon - resistance is utterly futile (lyrics from it title this review). I've seen family films get to the parents before - ""Wall-E"", ""Despicable Me"" and even Disney's remake of ""The Parent Trap"" - but never quite like this.""You've been a friend to me..."" Mary Chapin Carpenter sings.Buy this gorgeous family movie on BLU RAY (where it deserves to be) and find out why it's lovely story of redemption has touched the hearts of millions...",5,"""...Rocks

Anna Paquin is really nice, and Jeff Daniels is an alright actor, although I haven't seen him too much in films, apart from Dumb & Dumber & Speed obviously!What a touching film! I loved it, and got quite teary throughout. Anna Paquin, although shockingly young (but she still looks the same!), is showing herself to be a really good actress, even from such a young age, even more so in the brilliant X-Men films. Even my Dad couldn't believe how she still looked the exact same - old before her years I think. The storyline is that she loses her mother in a car crash in New Zealand, and her dad (played by a very shaggy Jeff Daniels) is in Canada, but comes to get her, and bring her back 'home'. She hasn't seen her dad in 10 years, and he is a bit of a loner himself, but a good environmentalist. After trees get knocked down just outside their home, Amy finds some geese eggs, and takes them home to take care of them. As soon as the geese are born, they latch onto Amy as their mother, and she teaches them everything, even defending them against an evil bad guy cop, who wants to prevent them from flying, and clip their wings. But as they migrate south for the winter, the whole film then revolves around teaching them to fly. A very difficult job, but is successful.  And what a genius way of doing it! How anyone could kill these lovely animals is shocking, and it's amazing how throughout the film you watch them grow, and Amy and her dad's relationship grow & evolve.There are a few shocking moments in the film, some that will bring a tear to your eye, but there are some hilarious moments as well, including Jeff Daniels character bursting in on his daughter in the shower, after she starts screaming. (He's an inventor, and has invented some strange kind of shower gel tap thing.) The look of horror on both their faces was hilarious, and had you in fits, as her dad's character just stands there.There are a few strange scenes as well, particularly of the scene of Anna Paquin either getting her nose pierced, or having a clip on put in. It doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the film,  and is obviously part of a storyline that was ultimately cut, but that was left in.It's such a sweet storyline, and not totally aimed at kids, meaning adults can not feel embarrassed watching a 'kids' movie. I love being an adult (ha) and still being able to watch kids movie, or movies I watched as a kid, and being able to understand and enjoy them better as an adult. You have to see this movie once in your lifetime, perfect for relaxing to, and just enjoying a couple of hours of 'me' time.

First is the story of a young teenage girl, marvelously portrayed by Anna Paquin, who is forced to move to Canada to live with her father, whom she barely knows, after her mother dies. The second story is how she cares for a gaggle of geese who have her imprinted as their mother, and how she and her father decide to help the geese migrate to the Southern United States rather than have their wings clipped and live as tame rather than wild geese. As the two of them first learn to fly the ultra light aircraft that they will use to transport the geese and then actually undertake the journey to lead the geese south, they too manage to bond, just as the girl has with her geese. The end, when the girl has to fly the final leg by herself after her father has sustained an injury, will bring a tear to the eye of even the most flinty-hearted individual.This is one of those films that some film viewers might overlook that they ought not. Many films are driven by cinematics; some, like this one, are driven by a marvelous story.

It has an appeal that adults can relate to, and kids simply love it.  My family has watched this movie together many times.The story is about a young girl (Amy, played excellently by Anna Panquin) whose parents have split up; her father (Jeff Daniels) lives in Canada and her mother with whom she lives is in New Zealand.  When mom is killed in an auto accident, Amy goes to Canada to live with her downright eccentric dad.  She is unhappy and out of place until she adopts a flock of baby geese, and this is where the story really starts.  The geese have lost their parents, and do not know how to migrate.  Amy and her dad and their friends decide to teach them how.  What a great story, and the cinematography of the flight scenes is breathtaking and astounding!  This is a funny, touching, and entertaining movie that deserves every one of the five stars that most reviewers have awarded it.  The story is out there on the outer edge of plausibility and this gives it a magical quality that sends the message that all things are possible with perserverence, intelligence, and luck. I cannot imagine any family not enjoying this superb film.Fine performances by Miss Panquin, Jeff Daniels and the supporting cast.  This is one of those films where everything came together very well, to make what has become a true classic.  The storyline moves along smartly, the acting is consistently good, and the ending is truly touching.

His ex-wife is killed in car crash, but his precocious daughter Amy (Anna Paquin, also excellent) survives.  Tom takes her in, and soon Amy becomes attached to a gaggle of orphaned Canadian Geese.  They adopt her as her mother, and soon she can't walk anywhere without an adorable caravan of stumbling, bumbling goslings.  Penguins may be the most adored birds, but these geese give them a run for their money.Steadfastly refusing to clip their wings, the Aldens confront the fact that these are migratory birds.  What to do, when Amy can't teach them to fly?  The answer is simple - build two ultralights and guide them to a bucolic-yet-threatened bird sanctuary in North Carolina.This is quite simply a wonderful family film where the heroes are straightforward, good-hearted people and the villains, if there are any, aren't all that bad either.  Adapted from Bill Lishman's autobiography, the movie strikes true note after true note.This shouldn't be a surprise - the director is Carroll Ballard, who directed the delightful ""Black Stallion"" and ""Never Cry Wolf.""

Thirteen year old Amy looses her mother, and has to live with her estranged dad who is well, strange- He spends his time flying ultralight airplanes and making odd sculptures and inventions. She copes by raising geese, who have also lost their mother (due to evil developers). The geese think Amy is her mother and follow her everywhere. The problem is that geese generally migrate south every winter, but there is no one to show Amy's geese the way- until Amy, her dad, and family hatch this brilliant scheme to show them the way south by leading them on an ultralight airplane.The movie works quite well until the actual migration. We get to see Amy's complex reaction to loosing her mother, and how raising the geese helps her adjust to her wacky father and family, and her new life.  But the movie changes tone and becomes rather silly and unrealistic during the flight scenes, pulling tricks of a Disney movie to get cheap thrills: they land on an air force base with no consequences, they suddenly find themselves flying in the middle of Baltimore city due to fog.  There are the one-dimensional villains (the evil developers), and the random, `family moments' which in this case are awkward, ill-placed conversations between father and daughter about loss and the importance of family.With all that said, the migration scenes are still very, very nice (but could have been truly spectacular without the silliness mentioned above) because the real stars are the geese themselves (who are extraordinarily charming and graceful) and the fantastic scenery.It is worth it to watch some of the additional material. But note, you will find that the REAL story is quite different from the story told in the movie.  The actual story is not about a young girl and her father bonding over geese, but a serious scientific venture to save endangered birds such as certain crane species.",4,A very nice movie with some silly elements,1150416000,"06 16, 2006",2006,1907,"['very', 'nice', 'movie', 'overall', 'Thirteen', 'year', 'old', 'Amy', 'mother', 'live', 'estranged', 'dad', 'who', 'well', 'strange-', 'time', 'flying', 'ultralight', 'airplanes', 'making', 'odd', 'sculptures', 'inventions', 'raising', 'geese', 'who', 'have', 'also', 'lost', 'mother', 'due', 'evil', 'developers', 'geese', 'think', 'Amy', 'mother', 'follow', 'everywhere', 'problem', 'geese', 'generally', 'migrate', 'south', 'winter', 'one', 'show', 'Amy', 'geese', 'way-', 'Amy', 'dad', 'family', 'hatch', 'brilliant', 'scheme', 'show', 'way', 'south', 'leading', 'ultralight', 'airplane.The', 'movie', 'quite', 'well', 'actual', 'migration', 'get', 'see', 'Amy', 'complex', 'reaction', 'loosing', 'mother', 'how', 'raising', 'geese', 'adjust', 'wacky', 'father', 'family', 'new', 'life', 'movie', 'tone', 'rather', 'silly', 'unrealistic', 'flight', 'scenes', 'pulling', 'tricks', 'Disney', 'movie', 'get', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'land', 'air', 'force', 'base', 'consequences', 'suddenly', 'find', 'flying', 'middle', 'Baltimore', 'city', 'due', 'fog', 'are', 'one-dimensional', 'villains', 'evil', 'developers', 'random', 'family', 'moments', 'case', 'are', 'awkward', 'ill-placed', 'conversations', 'father', 'daughter', 'loss', 'importance', 'family.With', 'said', 'migration', 'scenes', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'very', 'nice', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'spectacular', 'silliness', 'mentioned', 'real', 'stars', 'are', 'geese', 'who', 'are', 'extraordinarily', 'charming', 'graceful', 'fantastic', 'scenery.It', 'watch', 'additional', 'material', 'note', 'will', 'find', 'REAL', 'story', 'quite', 'different', 'story', 'told', 'movie', 'actual', 'story', 'not', 'young', 'girl', 'father', 'bonding', 'geese', 'serious', 'scientific', 'venture', 'save', 'endangered', 'birds', 'such', 'certain', 'crane', 'species']",N/A

I was lucky enough once to catch it on TV, however I still didn't get to watch the opening that time.  I once ran into it at my local video store, for just about five dollars so I decided to buy it.I was very pleased with this film, I finally got the chance to watch it throughly and I am very glad I did, I'm also glad I own it so I can watch it any time.  I've seen the film many times since I bought it, each time I watch it, I like it more and more.  The story is about a 13-year-old girl who's just lost her mother, now living with her father she struggles to adjust to a new life in Canada.  However, that changes the day she finds a group of orphaned goose eggs and becomes their loving mother.Later, the geese are born, everything is fine.  However, the geese need to fly south for the winter and that is not going to be an easy task for them as they have no real goose mother to lead them the way.  Some neighboors try to help by taking the ability to fly away from the geese, but Amy (Our little Mother Goose) does not approve of that.  Her father has a much better idea, build a sort of flying machine for him and for Amy, which they will use to fly the geese south, a plan they whole-heartedly hope will work.The movie is beautifully filmed, the settings and backgrounds are breathtaking, very pretty.  The film is caressed by lovely melodies, some upbeat and happy, some sad and slow.  A gorgeous song, ""Ten Thousand Miles"" opens the film in a kind of slow, heartly way.  The actors and actrices do a wonderful job of portraying their characters, all of them are very believable.  There are several elements of humor and fun scattered through the film, not so to make the film a comedy in any way, but to add a bit of comic relief.I would recommend this film to anyone who would enjoy a nice family film, it's really worth getting, I can almost guarrantee you'll want to watch it again and again.",5,"Stunning film, perfect for the entire family!",1110758400,"03 14, 2005",2005,2118,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'school', 'was', 'amazed', 'simple', 'beauty', 'unfortunately', 'time', 'saw', 'had', ""n't"", 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'throughly', 'basically', 'missed', 'opening', 'ending', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'once', 'catch', 'TV', 'however', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'watch', 'opening', 'time', 'once', 'ran', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'just', 'five', 'dollars', 'so', 'decided', 'buy', 'it.I', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'film', 'finally', 'got', 'chance', 'watch', 'throughly', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'did', ""'m"", 'also', 'glad', 'own', 'can', 'watch', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'many', 'times', 'bought', 'time', 'watch', 'like', 'more', 'more', 'story', '13-year-old', 'girl', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'mother', 'now', 'living', 'father', 'adjust', 'new', 'life', 'Canada', 'However', 'day', 'group', 'orphaned', 'goose', 'eggs', 'loving', 'mother.Later', 'geese', 'are', 'born', 'everything', 'fine', 'However', 'geese', 'need', 'fly', 'south', 'winter', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'easy', 'task', 'have', 'real', 'goose', 'mother', 'lead', 'way', 'neighboors', 'try', 'help', 'taking', 'ability', 'fly', 'away', 'geese', 'Amy', 'little', 'Mother', 'Goose', 'not', 'approve', 'father', 'much', 'better', 'idea', 'build', 'sort', 'flying', 'machine', 'Amy', 'will', 'use', 'fly', 'geese', 'south', 'plan', 'whole-heartedly', 'hope', 'will', 'work.The', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'settings', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'very', 'pretty', 'film', 'caressed', 'lovely', 'melodies', 'upbeat', 'happy', 'sad', 'slow', 'gorgeous', 'song', 'Ten', 'Thousand', 'Miles', 'film', 'kind', 'slow', 'heartly', 'way', 'actors', 'actrices', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portraying', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'believable', 'are', 'several', 'elements', 'humor', 'fun', 'scattered', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'make', 'film', 'comedy', 'way', 'add', 'bit', 'comic', 'relief.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'enjoy', 'nice', 'family', 'film', 'really', 'worth', 'getting', 'can', 'almost', 'guarrantee', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'again']",N/A

It stars Anna Paquin [of ""The Piano"" and also the recent ""True Blood""] as 13-year-old Amy, who has lost her mother in a car accident and finds herself being whisked off to rural Ontario, Canada by her estranged father Tom [Jeff Daniels]. Amy struggles with her grief whilst trying to adapt to her new living conditions, including a father she barely knows. When Amy discovers a clutch of orphaned goose eggs, she takes care of the eggs until they hatch, and insists on caring for them, despite the ominous presence of an animal control officer who wants to take possession of themThe movie deals with myriad themes - grief, the bond between a young girl and the orphaned animals she loves, the pangs of adolescence, the bond between a father and child, and the simple, but true love of nature. Anna Paquin shines in the lead role, and reflects a maturity and determination uncommon in one so young. Her interactions with the geese come across as natural and credible, and are a delight to watch.
