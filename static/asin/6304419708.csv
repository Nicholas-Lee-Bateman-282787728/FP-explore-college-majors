420622,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304419708,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I'm kind of obsessed with Jane Campion.  She just has this magical way of making her films feel exotic and intoxicating and they just crawl under your skin and fester in the most exciting ways.  `The Portrait of a Lady' is no exception.  In fact, this little gem is one of her finest works, up there with `The Piano' and `Bright Star'.The film adapts the novel by Henry James, telling the story of Isabel Archer, a dreamer who is not beyond reaching for something she perceives out there for the taking.  She is certainly vied for by many, but their advances are lost on her as her sights are set on larger fish, mainly an independence that no mere man can offer her.  When a seemingly well intentioned (yet dastardly treacherous) `friend', Madame Serena Merle, enters the picture, things change for Isabel.  Soon she is being courted by an art collector, Gilbert Osmond, with strangely hypnotic charms and an eye firmly resting on Isabel's pocketbook (which contains a hefty inheritance from a dearly departed friend).  As her relationship and eventual marriage to Gilbert takes a nasty turn, Isabel begins to uncover a deeper self she wasn't expecting.In the hands of a lesser visionary, this film could have been so much less that it is.  Period films of this nature really need a strong point of view, otherwise they come across stilted and dusty; ill paced and even boring.  That isn't the case with `The Portrait of a Lady'.  Jane Campion drenches her scenes in sensual frustrations that live and breathe in the audiences mind, cultivating a structural dynamic that engages the audience and dwells on the mind.The way Gilbert touches Isabel's wrists and the way she exhales in his ear, her breath on his neck and my pulse is racing.Without strong performances, these scenes just wouldn't work, and not many directors know how to pull from the depths of an actor like Campion does (I mean, seriously...her actors are outstanding).  Nicole Kidman is fantastic as the emotionally ambushed Isabel.  She really sells her characters understanding of her circumstance and the way she handles the uncovering to the truth sends a devastating blow straight through to the viewer.  John Malkovich has defined creepy seduction for years and for some reason the world goes gaga for him, when I simply find him unappealing (unless he's pointing the finger at his own persona so marvelously, as he did in `Being John Malkovich') but I must admit that he works VERY well here.  Honestly though, the queen of the evening is Barbara Hershey (such a delicious Supporting Actress Oscar nominee she was).  The way she haunts her scenes with this underlined maliciousness that is so intoxicating and so breathtakingly gorgeous in appearance yet lethal to the touch; she understood femme fatale and delivered effortlessly.I wanted her to be in every scene.A Campion classic, this one is.  I totally recommend it.  The little tricks (that `silent picture' interlude for one) that are on full display here elevate this film and help establish something deeper, richer and more complex than one could have imagined.",5,What a beautiful portrait this is...,1299024000,"03 2, 2011",2011,3095,"[""'m"", 'kind', 'obsessed', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'just', 'magical', 'way', 'making', 'films', 'feel', 'exotic', 'intoxicating', 'just', 'crawl', 'skin', 'fester', 'most', 'exciting', 'ways', 'Portrait', 'Lady', 'exception', 'fact', 'little', 'gem', 'one', 'finest', 'works', 'up', 'there', 'Piano', 'Bright', ""Star'.The"", 'film', 'novel', 'Henry', 'James', 'telling', 'story', 'Isabel', 'Archer', 'dreamer', 'who', 'not', 'reaching', 'something', 'out', 'there', 'taking', 'certainly', 'vied', 'many', 'advances', 'are', 'lost', 'sights', 'are', 'set', 'larger', 'fish', 'mainly', 'independence', 'mere', 'man', 'can', 'offer', 'When', 'seemingly', 'well', 'intentioned', 'yet', 'dastardly', 'treacherous', 'friend', 'Madame', 'Serena', 'Merle', 'picture', 'things', 'change', 'Isabel', 'Soon', 'being', 'courted', 'art', 'collector', 'Gilbert', 'Osmond', 'strangely', 'hypnotic', 'charms', 'eye', 'firmly', 'resting', 'Isabel', 'pocketbook', 'hefty', 'inheritance', 'dearly', 'departed', 'friend', 'relationship', 'eventual', 'marriage', 'Gilbert', 'nasty', 'turn', 'Isabel', 'uncover', 'deeper', 'self', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting.In', 'hands', 'lesser', 'visionary', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'Period', 'films', 'nature', 'really', 'need', 'strong', 'point', 'view', 'otherwise', 'come', 'stilted', 'dusty', 'ill', 'paced', 'even', 'boring', ""n't"", 'case', 'Portrait', 'Lady', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'scenes', 'sensual', 'frustrations', 'live', 'breathe', 'audiences', 'mind', 'cultivating', 'structural', 'dynamic', 'audience', 'dwells', 'mind.The', 'way', 'Gilbert', 'Isabel', 'wrists', 'way', 'ear', 'breath', 'neck', 'pulse', 'racing.Without', 'strong', 'performances', 'scenes', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'not', 'many', 'directors', 'know', 'how', 'pull', 'depths', 'actor', 'Campion', 'mean', 'seriously', 'actors', 'are', 'outstanding', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'fantastic', 'emotionally', 'ambushed', 'Isabel', 'really', 'characters', 'understanding', 'circumstance', 'way', 'uncovering', 'truth', 'devastating', 'blow', 'straight', 'viewer', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'defined', 'creepy', 'seduction', 'years', 'reason', 'world', 'gaga', 'when', 'simply', 'find', 'unappealing', 'pointing', 'finger', 'own', 'persona', 'so', 'marvelously', 'did', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'must', 'admit', 'VERY', 'well', 'here', 'Honestly', 'queen', 'evening', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'such', 'delicious', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'was', 'way', 'scenes', 'underlined', 'maliciousness', 'so', 'intoxicating', 'so', 'breathtakingly', 'gorgeous', 'appearance', 'yet', 'lethal', 'touch', 'understood', 'femme', 'fatale', 'delivered', 'effortlessly.I', 'wanted', 'be', 'scene.A', 'Campion', 'classic', 'one', 'totally', 'recommend', 'little', 'tricks', 'silent', 'picture', 'interlude', 'one', 'are', 'full', 'display', 'here', 'elevate', 'film', 'help', 'establish', 'something', 'deeper', 'richer', 'more', 'complex', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'imagined']",Portrait of a Lady VHS
420623,AKH9SCCIYSSGJ,6304419708,anna-joelle,"[33, 37]","Nicole Kidman IS Isabel Archer! I don't understand why some reviewers here panned her acting as bad. She has never looked more beautiful than in this film. Her acting is also superb and expressive.This is the story about a young American woman (Isabel) who is just orphaned and is invited to stay with her rich relatives, the Touchetts in Victorian England. While in England, she is wooed by the rich Lord Warburton but she rejects his proposal because she wants to see the world and be free. When her uncle later dies, Isabel inherits a big sum of money and becomes truly rich and &quot;independent&quot;. It is actually her cousin, the consumptive Ralph Touchett (who is secretly in love with her) who pressed his father to leave the money to Isabel without Isabel's knowledge. By this time, Isabel has met the scheming and mysterious Madame Merle (who plays Schubert on the piano most beautifully, I must add). M. Merle introduces Isabel to &quot;her friend&quot;, Gilbert Osmond, a poor and widowed American staying in Italy who has a young daughter, Pansy. Both M. Merle and Osmond scheme to make Isabel marry Osmond so that he could have her money. Isabel innocently falls into their trap. Despite advice and dissuasions from her relatives, she eagerly marries Osmond and her life after that becomes a true nightmare. There is also a sub-plot involving Pansy's impossible love affair with Ned Rossum (played by Christian Bale).The accompanying booklet of the DVD provides valuable information on the making of the film and the cast profile e.g. the fact that Jane Campion finds this to be her hardest project. From the movie, it is easy to see that she had put in tremendous effort to bring Henry James' classic to life. Every shot, every scene and every movement of the characters is carefully and beautifully directed and filmed. The colors are so rich, the seem to jump out of the screen! And oh, the gorgeous costumes - especially Isabel Archer's!The casting is also perfect - notably, Nicole Kidman and John Malkovich who plays the villain, Osmond. Martin Donovan also embraces the difficult role of &quot;Ralph Touchett&quot; perfectly. My favourite scene is the one nearing the end involving a sobbing, heart-broken Isabel by the bedside of the dying Ralph. It is here that she realizes she loves him. This scene is so tender to watch. To me, this film showcases Nicole Kidman's best performance and it is THIS particular scene that clinches it.I got my copy of the DVD from Amazon.co.uk. If you love period dramas, this is a worthy title to have in your collection.

420624,A355VZC33RZGNA,6304419708,A Viewer and Reader,"[2, 2]","Two themes characterize Henry James' novels and are wonderfully rendered in this film: they are fortune hunting and the depiction of wealthy guileless naive Americans in the hands of sophisticated wordly Europeans. Isabel Archer is such a creation, an American transplant to England exploring her self and future, and full of beauty and promise.  At the outset she rejects Lord Warburton, the man who should be perfect for her, so she can find her 'self' and let light into her soul.  ""I am very fond of my liberty...I wish to choose my fate"" she tells her cousin, Ralph Touchett who also is in love with her. Isabel's idea of happiness is a romantic journey into the unknown, ""A swift carriage ride, of a dark night...""  She appears to be independent and full of purpose, but Isabel is also an innocent with a streak of sensuality in her being.  In her naivete' she mistakes the heartless Gilbert Osmund's sensual indulgments for refinement and is captivated by him, while he determines to possess her for her money.  The marriage is a disaster for Isabel whose world becomes darker and progressively more oppressive.  At last the mortal illness of her cousin, Ralph, allows her to escape Osmund and go back to England. Now all has come full circle, she is older, wiser, she meets again another ex-suitor, Casper Goodwood.  He pleads with her to leave Osmund and make a new life for herself with him.  She is back at the moment where it all began and she can start over, she has only to make the choice.It is not only Henry James plot but the way director Campion presents it that makes this film great and utterly intriguing with every viewing.  Nichole Kidman presents a marvelous performance of a woman pursuing not only her vision but also struggling with forces within herself and around her that she, at first, doesn't understand.  Kidman is the perfect foil for John Malkovich's superb portrayal of Osmund, a shallow sinister dilettante who manipulates Isabel, his daughter, and his ex-mistress like objects.  In Campion's settings the lighting of the opulent surroundings dims as Isabel's world closes about her. In the final scene she makes her choice and turns away from the welcoming warmth of Casper Goodwood's world; she chooses to remain out in the cold.  She's not stupid. She's no longer innocent, but she rejects the light for the dark and returns to her abuser.  Why?In her rejection of one promising suitor after another, men who are clearly devoted to her, Isabel reveals that engulfing love terrifies her because it will destroy her independence.  The only man she can totally give her love to is her cousin Ralph Touchett, on his deathbed, since she will be free again after he dies.  We see also in her early fantasy of a threesome with her suitors that there is a strong element of sensuality in her persona that Osmund perceives and exploits, even to the degree that she is roused as he abuses her.  Certainly Osmund doesn't love her.  She now knows she is nothing but an ornamental bankroll in his shallow world so she no longer has to surrender her independence to him.  Yet she returns to him because he challenges her in ways that other suitors never could, and in this Isabel emerges as the most subtle, complex, courageous, and triumphant persona of all.In fact Henry James modeled Isabel Archer after his patroness, Isabella Stuart Gardner, whose life is revealed in Douglass Shand-Tucci's biography, ""The Art Of Scandal"".",5,Portrait Of A Lady In A Swift Carriage Of A Dark Night,943401600,"11 24, 1999",1999,3455,"['Two', 'themes', 'characterize', 'Henry', 'James', 'novels', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'rendered', 'film', 'are', 'fortune', 'hunting', 'depiction', 'wealthy', 'guileless', 'naive', 'Americans', 'hands', 'sophisticated', 'wordly', 'Europeans', 'Isabel', 'Archer', 'such', 'creation', 'American', 'transplant', 'England', 'exploring', 'self', 'future', 'full', 'beauty', 'promise', 'outset', 'Lord', 'Warburton', 'man', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'perfect', 'can', 'find', 'let', 'light', 'soul', 'am', 'very', 'fond', 'liberty', 'wish', 'choose', 'fate', 'cousin', 'Ralph', 'Touchett', 'who', 'also', 'love', 'Isabel', 'idea', 'happiness', 'romantic', 'journey', 'unknown', 'swift', 'carriage', 'ride', 'dark', 'night', 'be', 'independent', 'full', 'purpose', 'Isabel', 'also', 'innocent', 'streak', 'sensuality', 'being', 'naivete', 'heartless', 'Gilbert', 'Osmund', 'sensual', 'indulgments', 'refinement', 'captivated', 'possess', 'money', 'marriage', 'disaster', 'Isabel', 'world', 'darker', 'progressively', 'more', 'oppressive', 'last', 'mortal', 'illness', 'cousin', 'Ralph', 'escape', 'Osmund', 'go', 'back', 'England', 'Now', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'older', 'wiser', 'again', 'ex-suitor', 'Casper', 'Goodwood', 'leave', 'Osmund', 'make', 'new', 'life', 'back', 'moment', 'where', 'began', 'can', 'start', 'only', 'make', 'choice.It', 'not', 'only', 'Henry', 'James', 'plot', 'way', 'director', 'Campion', 'film', 'great', 'utterly', 'intriguing', 'viewing', 'Nichole', 'Kidman', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'woman', 'pursuing', 'not', 'only', 'vision', 'also', 'struggling', 'forces', 'first', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Kidman', 'perfect', 'foil', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'superb', 'portrayal', 'Osmund', 'shallow', 'sinister', 'dilettante', 'who', 'Isabel', 'daughter', 'ex-mistress', 'objects', 'Campion', 'settings', 'lighting', 'opulent', 'surroundings', 'dims', 'Isabel', 'world', 'final', 'scene', 'choice', 'away', 'welcoming', 'warmth', 'Casper', 'Goodwood', 'world', 'remain', 'out', 'cold', 'not', 'stupid', 'no', 'longer', 'innocent', 'light', 'dark', 'returns', 'abuser', 'Why', 'rejection', 'one', 'promising', 'suitor', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'clearly', 'devoted', 'Isabel', 'engulfing', 'love', 'terrifies', 'will', 'destroy', 'independence', 'only', 'man', 'can', 'totally', 'give', 'love', 'cousin', 'Ralph', 'Touchett', 'deathbed', 'will', 'be', 'free', 'again', 'see', 'also', 'early', 'fantasy', 'threesome', 'suitors', 'strong', 'element', 'sensuality', 'persona', 'Osmund', 'perceives', 'exploits', 'even', 'degree', 'roused', 'Certainly', 'Osmund', ""n't"", 'love', 'now', 'nothing', 'ornamental', 'bankroll', 'shallow', 'world', 'longer', 'surrender', 'independence', 'ways', 'other', 'suitors', 'never', 'could', 'Isabel', 'most', 'subtle', 'complex', 'courageous', 'triumphant', 'persona', 'all.In', 'fact', 'Henry', 'James', 'modeled', 'Isabel', 'Archer', 'patroness', 'Isabella', 'Stuart', 'Gardner', 'life', 'revealed', 'Douglass', 'Shand-Tucci', 'biography', 'Art', 'Scandal']",Portrait of a Lady VHS

I found that my male collegues were not so enticed by it. It may be that men have not felt the same domination in relationships that Nicole's character portrays so bravely.And yet, I wonder.

420628,A280GY5UVUS2QH,6304419708,Doug Anderson,"[6, 7]","Visually, I would rate this film five stars. And, I'm certain, that those reviewers who see past this film's flaws and award the film four or five stars are rewarding the stunning visuals. But, dramatically, its barely a three (and that's being generous), because, unfortunatley, it seems, that Campion is far more interested in period detail and far more fascinated with various costume choices and interior designs than she is in allowing her actual characters to do or say interesting things. No one in this film is alive. This is, in part, the theme of the film (and Henry James' fiction in general): everyone, in some way, is living a stifled life. But, it is a problem when the sets are infused with more color & life than the actual people. Mary-Louise Parker (whose eccentric bespectacled performance is the most memorable thing about this film) is perhaps the exception here; she breathes life into every scene she is in. But there isn't much air in these salon rooms and the characters just don't seem to connect to each other. This is especially true of Martin Donovan, who plays Isabel Archer's consumptive cousin and confidante, ""Ralph Touchette"". Donovan looks every bit the part (he looks like he just walked out of a Whistler or a Sargent) but we never feel that he really cares for Isabel nor she for him. The indigo and purple and green color palette that surrounds Donovan and co. is really striking but instead of expressively accenting character moods the colors seem only to highlight a lack. Director Campion does provide a few creative bursts which promise to break through the films subdued surfaces--I am thinking of the 2-3 anachronistically avant-garde fantasy sequences that momentarily threaten to artfully collapse the late-Victorian veneer-- but they are contained bursts that produce no real effects (in the audience or in the characters). Its as if Campion spent all her time figuring out what everyone and everything should look like and had no time left to infuse her still life with any energy or enthusiasm. The result is that the film feels, well, like a fin de siecle museum exhibit, which is unfortunate as this is supposed to be a film about an intelligent and sensual woman's coming to life!To be fair, there are plenty of fine actors in this film (John Gielgud, Shelly Winters, Martin Donovan, Christian Bale, Viggo Mortensen, Richard Grant, Barbara Hershey, Mary Louise Parker) but the one character that matters most, and the one that is supposed to be the very embodiment of life, ""Isabel Archer"", is played by a strangely self-conscious and self-contained, Nicole Kidman. Kidman is beautiful and brilliant in her way and she wears her satin gowns exceptionally well, but she never succeeds in allowing us any access to what thoughts & passions drive one of the most complex female characters in fiction; and she never really connects with any of the other actors; its as if her panoply of emotions all come from some invisible source. The men in her life seem not to matter at all. The performance is solipsistic (and many of the performances in this film are just that). All we really get from Kidman is a youthful yearning & promise that then, all too quickly (after about one hour of cinema time), turns to a full-on pout once she falls for ""Gilbert Osmond"" played by the clownishly evil John Malkovich (this pout lasts for one hour and twenty minutes). Malkovich's performance seems to be a study in extremes as he veers between too-lazy-to-care dilettantism & manic misogyny. Malkovich has made a career out of playing bohemian burn-outs (Dangerous Liasons, Sheltering Sky...) but this one is so detestable that it borders on self-caricature. Barbara Hershey, as Osmond's accomplice ""Serena"", fairs slightly better. Taken alone each actor seems perfectly suited to play their roles, but somehow the characters just don't materialize; the actors take turns having their big moments but these moments just don't seem to add up to anything that we care to count. The characters never really matter to us, the magnitude of their emotions seem unconvincing, and so this Jamesian plot just seems trifling.I think Campion very much wants this film to be an emblematic film about all free-thinking woman on the cusp of life (and the opening credits that roll while various young women of all races look on seems to be a testament to this), but since she fails to give us a sense of Isabel Archer's deep longing for free choice and danger, we fail to feel the tragedy of her dream of endless options being thwarted and her dream of danger, ironically, coming true.",3,"The film, like Isabel Archer, is bursting with promise unfulfilled",1203379200,"02 19, 2008",2008,4608,"['Visually', 'would', 'rate', 'film', 'five', 'stars', ""'m"", 'certain', 'reviewers',

420635,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6304419708,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[9, 9]","Henry James was realistic about women at the end of the 19th century, particularly those standing between the US and Great Britain. Isabel is such a woman. She gets into the world without any parents but with a tremendously good uncle and cousin. She is surrounded with men who love her and want to marry her out of love. She refuses them, three of them, to be able to see the world. And she falls in the hands of a social climber, a social parasite and a fortune hunter who covers up his liaison with the woman who introduced her to him, and whose daughter is the out-of-wedlock child of this very woman. She is of course deeply unhappy, alone, brutalized too, and yet she tries to save the daughter from her fate. She fails because the daughter is totally under the tyrannical authority of her father, an authority that is tyrannical only because the daughter accepts it and submits to it, particularly because of the teachings of some good Catholic nuns. Finally Isabel finds the energy to escape - for a while at least - from that husband when she learns his liaison and she can force him to accept. But she is so pent up in her stubborn decision that she can never step back and consider a real escape. Yet, maybe, at the end, there is a wavering touch of hope - for her. It is incredible how this woman, who wants to be strong-headed and independent, fails to see the men who love her and to recognize the man who uses her. As it is said in the film somewhere, Americans cannot become Europeans, and yet Isabel succeeds very well in becoming twisted and thwarted in Europe. Is that typically European ? Maybe. Nicole Kidman plays the role with style, delicacy, dainty and quaint nuances, but also with a tremendous amount of gusto, sentiment, feeling and emotion. She is probably ten times better than she had ever been, now she can measure herself with actors that are not stereotyped. Her freedom is probably the key to her present depth. Is the film a metaphor of her life ? Maybe. But who cares. What is important is that this Nicole Kidman is able to bring us such a marvellous masterpiece, though some of the  special effects  (strange camera angles and mirror effects) could have been avoided to reach a more intense purity.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Love and Freedom don't go together,1072483200,"12 27, 2003",2003,2258,"['Henry', 'James', 'was', 'realistic', 'women', 'end', '19th', 'century', 'particularly', 'standing', 'US', 'Great', 'Britain', 'Isabel', 'such', 'woman', 'world', 'parents', 'tremendously', 'good', 'uncle', 'cousin', 'surrounded', 'men', 'who', 'love', 'want', 'marry', 'love', 'three', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'world', 'hands', 'social', 'climber', 'social', 'parasite', 'fortune', 'hunter', 'who', 'up', 'liaison', 'woman', 'who', 'introduced', 'daughter', 'out-of-wedlock', 'child', 'very', 'woman', 'course', 'deeply', 'unhappy', 'alone', 'brutalized', 'too', 'yet', 'save', 'daughter', 'fate', 'daughter', 'totally', 'tyrannical', 'authority', 'father', 'authority', 'tyrannical', 'only', 'daughter', 'particularly', 'teachings', 'good', 'Catholic', 'nuns', 'Finally', 'Isabel', 'energy', 'escape', 'while', 'least', 'husband', 'when', 'liaison', 'can', 'force', 'accept', 'so', 'pent', 'up', 'stubborn', 'decision', 'can', 'never', 'step', 'back', 'consider', 'real', 'escape', 'maybe', 'end', 'wavering', 'touch', 'hope', 'incredible', 'how', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'strong-headed', 'independent', 'see', 'men', 'who', 'love', 'recognize', 'man', 'who', 'said', 'film', 'somewhere', 'Americans', 'can', 'not', 'become', 'Europeans', 'yet', 'Isabel', 'very', 'well', 'becoming', 'twisted', 'thwarted', 'Europe', 'typically', 'European', 'Maybe', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'role', 'style', 'delicacy', 'dainty', 'quaint', 'nuances', 'also', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'gusto', 'sentiment', 'feeling', 'emotion', 'probably', 'ten', 'times', 'better', 'had', 'ever', 'been', 'now', 'can', 'measure', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'stereotyped', 'freedom', 'probably', 'key', 'present', 'depth', 'film', 'metaphor', 'life', 'Maybe', 'who', 'What', 'important', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'able', 'bring', 'marvellous', 'masterpiece', 'special', 'effects', 'strange', 'camera', 'angles', 'mirror', 'effects', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'reach', 'more', 'intense', 'purity.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Portrait of a Lady VHS
420636,A11GVIS6AXDEAX,6304419708,James Chong,"[17, 21]","i first read henry james' great novel when i was a teenager. i remember being fascinated by the astounding complexity of his characters -- how every one of them seemed to mask his or her own hidden agendas beneath layers and layers of &quot;proper&quot; social veneers.the Isabel Archer in the beginning of the novel was an outsider, fresh from america, who single-handedly breathed a new life into the stale surroundings of these rigid european social constructs. she was an ephemeral presence, a beam of light around whom both men and women hovered and wished to take something from. the main dilemma that the novel posed was how this young, somewhat naive outsider could hold true to her dreams of bettering herself within a sophisticated european community without compromising her free-spirited nature and selling herself short. simply put, the novel was about a woman who was in a constant state of flux -- involved in a precarious juggling act involving her own aspirations and those of the people who claimed to love her.with her &quot;controversial&quot; ending to the film version, i believe that jane campion has brilliantly dramatized this state of flux, for in this scene, we see our heroine, once again, fleeing from her options (which are presented to her throughout the film in the form of aggressive male suitors and their various promises) rather than confronting them; but this time, as she rushes away from Caspar Goodwood's embrace in the icy yard and toward the warmth and security of Gardencourt, we see her suddenly stop at the threshold of the home and turn her gaze back toward the yard, back toward Caspar Goodwood. and the frame freezes and fades to black.critics of this scene are disappointed that campion chooses not to reveal, as James does in the novel, that Isabel leaves for Rome the very next day, thereby implying that she has decided to go back to Osmond and reject Goodwood yet again. however, i believe that drawing this sort of implication would be a far too literal and surface-level reading of the text. in the novel, Henrietta is the one who reveals to Goodwood that Isabel has left for Rome. Goodwood is stunned and is turning away when Henrietta grabs him and tells him to wait a moment. and then the novel ends. James seems to suggest that Henrietta will reveal to Goodwood -- who, like the readers at this point, is shocked at the thought that Isabel may actually go back to Osmond -- the true nature of Isabel's intentions. for me, the implication of all of this is that Isabel will return to Rome because it is her duty to confront Osmond, if only to tell him that she is leaving him. indeed, james devotes some time earlier in the final chapter to expounding about Isabel's inner dilemma over remaining true to her obligations.of course, this is only my reading of the text, but i believe that this reading helps elucidate campion's decision to end the film the way she does. for although, in the film, Isabel does turn at the threshold of the house to look back towards Goodwood, you will notice that her hand is still firmly on the door handle. she MUST open the door and enter the house and leave for Rome the next day because campion would not stray so far from the text as to betray the facts of the novel (which happens to be a work of literature that she reveres). by ending the film on this moment, campion is at once able to stay true to the facts of the text while dramatizing, in essence, what the whole film has been about: the precarious nature of an independent-natured woman's destiny in a world that aggressively forces her to choose between various life &quot;options&quot; that are really nothing more than thinly veiled, socially accepted constructs. just as the ending of the film is uncertain and ambiguous, campion suggests that so too was the future of a woman who dared to stray from the social conventions of that time.as an astonishing counterpoint to the women of Isabel's time, campion opens the film with an inspired segment in which we see a diverse range of young women looking attentively into the camera; some are sitting gracefully, others are dancing, some are dark skinned, others light, some have short hair, others long, and all are either smiling or looking content. earlier, we hear them discussing the impact of a kiss and the dreamy, romanticized attentions of a lover. campion suggests that these women are, in essence, the descendants and beneficiaries of Isabel Archer's earlier struggles to maintain her own identity within a socio-cultural paradigm that wished only to devour it. for these contemporary women, the nature of love and romance is a topic that is to be discussed in leisure and with fondness, not a crushing matter that could determine the course of their lives. THAT, campion suggests, is Isabel Archer's gift to them.",5,flux and paradigms,1021248000,"05 13, 2002",2002,4830,"['i', 'first', 'read', 'henry', 'james', 'great', 'novel', 'when', 'i', 'was', 'teenager', 'i', 'remember', 'being', 'fascinated', 'astounding', 'complexity', 'characters', 'how', 'one', 'seemed', 'mask', 'own', 'hidden', 'agendas', 'beneath', 'layers', 'layers', 'quot', 'quot', 'social', 'veneers.the', 'Isabel', 'Archer', 'beginning', 'novel', 'was', 'outsider', 'fresh', 'america', 'who', 'single-handedly', 'breathed', 'new', 'life', 'stale', 'surroundings', 'rigid', 'european', 'social', 'constructs', 'was', 'ephemeral', 'presence', 'beam', 'light', 'whom', 'men', 'women', 'hovered', 'wished', 'take', 'something', 'main', 'dilemma', 'novel', 'posed', 'was', 'how', 'young', 'somewhat', 'naive', 'outsider', 'could', 'hold', 'true', 'dreams', 'bettering', 'sophisticated', 'european', 'community', 'compromising', 'free-spirited', 'nature', 'selling', 'short', 'simply', 'put', 'novel', 'was', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'constant', 'state', 'flux', 'involved', 'precarious', 'juggling', 'act', 'involving', 'own', 'aspirations', 'people', 'who', 'claimed', 'love', 'her.with', 'quot', 'controversial', 'quot', 'ending', 'film', 'version', 'i', 'believe', 'jane', 'campion', 'brilliantly', 'dramatized', 'state', 'flux', 'scene', 'see', 'heroine', 'once', 'again', 'fleeing', 'options', 'are', 'presented', 'film', 'form', 'aggressive', 'male', 'suitors', 'various', 'promises', 'rather', 'confronting', 'time', 'away', 'Caspar', 'Goodwood', 'embrace', 'icy', 'yard', 'warmth', 'security', 'Gardencourt', 'see', 'suddenly', 'stop', 'threshold', 'home', 'turn', 'gaze', 'back', 'yard', 'back', 'Caspar', 'Goodwood', 'frame', 'fades', 'black.critics', 'scene', 'are', 'disappointed', 'campion', 'not', 'reveal', 'James', 'novel', 'Isabel', 'Rome', 'very', 'next', 'day', 'thereby', 'implying', 'decided', 'go', 'back', 'Osmond', 'reject', 'Goodwood', 'yet', 'again', 'however', 'i', 'believe', 'drawing', 'sort', 'implication', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'too', 'literal', 'surface-level', 'reading', 'text', 'novel', 'Henrietta', 'one', 'who', 'Goodwood', 'Isabel', 'left', 'Rome', 'Goodwood', 'stunned', 'turning', 'away', 'when', 'Henrietta', 'grabs', 'wait', 'moment', 'then', 'novel', 'James', 'suggest', 'Henrietta', 'will', 'reveal', 'Goodwood', 'who', 'readers', 'point', 'shocked', 'thought', 'Isabel', 'may', 'actually', 'go', 'back', 'Osmond', 'true', 'nature', 'Isabel', 'intentions', 'implication', 'Isabel', 'will', 'return', 'Rome', 'duty', 'confront', 'Osmond', 'only', 'tell', 'leaving', 'indeed', 'james', 'time', 'earlier', 'final', 'chapter', 'expounding', 'Isabel', 'inner', 'dilemma', 'remaining', 'true', 'obligations.of', 'course', 'only', 'reading', 'text', 'i', 'believe', 'reading', 'elucidate', 'campion', 'decision', 'end', 'film', 'way', 'film', 'Isabel', 'turn', 'threshold', 'house', 'look', 'back', 'towards', 'Goodwood', 'will', 'notice', 'hand', 'still', 'firmly', 'door', 'handle', 'MUST', 'open', 'door', 'enter', 'house', 'leave', 'Rome', 'next', 'day', 'campion', 'would', 'not', 'stray', 'so', 'far', 'text', 'betray', 'facts', 'novel', 'be', 'work', 'literature', 'ending', 'film', 'moment', 'campion', 'once', 'able', 'stay', 'true', 'facts', 'text', 'dramatizing', 'essence', 'what', 'whole', 'film', 'been', 'precarious', 'nature', 'independent-natured', 'woman', 'destiny', 'world', 'aggressively', 'choose', 'various', 'life', 'quot', 'options', 'quot', 'are', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'socially', 'accepted', 'constructs', 'just', 'ending', 'film', 'uncertain', 'ambiguous', 'campion', 'so', 'too', 'was', 'future', 'woman', 'who', 'dared', 'stray', 'social', 'conventions', 'astonishing', 'counterpoint', 'women', 'Isabel', 'time', 'campion', 'film', 'inspired', 'segment', 'see', 'diverse', 'range', 'young', 'women', 'looking', 'attentively', 'camera', 'are', 'sitting', 'gracefully', 'others', 'are', 'dancing', 'are', 'dark', 'skinned', 'others', 'light', 'have', 'short', 'hair', 'others', 'long', 'are', 'smiling', 'looking', 'content', 'earlier', 'hear', 'discussing', 'impact', 'kiss', 'dreamy', 'romanticized', 'attentions', 'lover', 'campion', 'women', 'are', 'essence', 'descendants', 'beneficiaries', 'Isabel', 'Archer', 'earlier', 'struggles', 'maintain', 'own', 'identity', 'socio-cultural', 'paradigm', 'wished', 'only', 'devour', 'contemporary', 'women', 'nature', 'love', 'romance', 'topic', 'be', 'discussed', 'leisure', 'fondness', 'not', 'crushing', 'matter', 'could', 'determine', 'course', 'lives', 'THAT', 'campion', 'suggests', 'Isabel', 'Archer', 'gift']",Portrait of a Lady VHS

Laura Jones also adapted Peter Carey's OSCAR AND LUCINDA and the same problem exists in that film as it does in THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY......short scenes, uneven character development and a lack of ""glue"" that ties it all together to make the viewer have a total sense of identification with the characters and their situations.Jane Campion certainly has a beautiful sense of how a film should look and feel visually, but this screenplay screams for the viewer to run to read the source material to truly understand character motivation.As in OSCAR AND LUCINDA, I read the book after viewing the film in order to REALLY understand what the film SO lacked.In other Henry James' film adaptations, such as THE BOSTONIANS and THE EUROPEANS, the treatment of James' material was much better (BOSTONIANS being the better of the two IMO). In THE PORTRAIT OF THE LADY, Laura Jones' script simply does not capture and distill the characters and the plot enough to grab a viewer for screen watching alone. The BBC mini series of PORTRAIT from the 1960's has alot more information in it, but it is still rather dull and is centered in the character Ralph Touchett and not Isabel Archer.Standing on it's own, without the book or other screen adaptations, Jane Campion's film is as cold as ice, filmed in dark blues with little light,and very disjointed. For all of it's gorgeous costuming, elegant set design and some moments of brilliant acting, PORTRAIT OF A LADY cannot overcome it's one biggest, glaring fault.....a BAD screenplay.

Her film, ""The Piano"" is a testament to that innate talent. This would lead one to believe that directing an adaptation of a Henry James novel would be a natural segue for her.While this is a lush and beautiful period piece, the problem with it is that it is somewhat dull. Despite stellar performances by Barbara Hershey and the supporting cast, the main star, Nicole Kidman, is out of her league, though she is a luminous beauty and has some acting ability. The problem is that her performance lacks the presence or depth necessary to transcend the material and make this a truly interesting film. She just is not good enough an actress to be able to carry this type of storyline and engage the viewer in the lead role of wealthy expatriate, Isabel Archer.Moreover, while John Malkovich gives a wonderful performance as the malevolent Gilbert Osmond, he is decidedly miscast as he is simply not charismatic enough to make it believable that Isabel Archer would throw caution to the wind over such an unattractive and, decidedly, sinister man.

I am more energetic when I have something good to say and this movie completely fullfills this. I have been fond of this film for some time now. It took me months to realize just how deeply I was touched by it and how it stayed  with me continually. Henry touches on FEMALE NATURE, and the foolishness of women to want an abusive husband. Henry couldn't do better with knowning a woman's soul literally. I have never seen a man be so wise in reading women like books. I am attracted to Ms. Archer because she reminds me so much of myself. It was quite evident that she was terrified of intimacy, and almost wanted someone to abuse her. Throughout the whole movie, she screamed inwardly, &quot; SAVE ME from myself.&quot; Many people have mentioned the word &quot;masochist&quot; in describing her character and I believe they are correct. To some level, most women are masochists. There is a battle between the sexes. This movie touches on it. Women, like Ms. Archer are afraid of REAL men who don't easily fall for them. When Ms. Archer supposedly returns to her husband Oswand, it shows her in-ability to grow and break away from him and her wanting abuse. The film touches on so much psychology of the female, I could go on forever. I only wished she would have given up and had been strong, and married the other respectable gentleman at the end of the film, and starved the other side of her till it vanished.

John Malkovich plays Gilbert Osmond, the fellow Isabel (Nicole Kidman) completely misreads and marries. I found him entirely wrong for the part. When I read the novel years ago, I cast my own movie version in my mind, as I'm sure many may do to help visualize what's being played out. Osmond is a ritualist, a sensualist, but a sensualist without love. He may have passion, but there would be no tenderness. He constantly compares himself to the pope, as he like the pontiff lives in Rome. Well, the actor who came to mind then, and still did when I re-read the book ages later, is Orson Welles, as he was in ""The Third Man"". It has to be someone who as I say is somewhat sensuous looking. And Welles was that, with his thick lips and satiated eyes. Malkovich? No, no way. Why would she ever have thought him attractive?

That movie is for some reason one of my favorite of all  time, despite the fact that I personally don't like romance movies or their  equivalent, &quot;chick flicks.&quot;  After seeing this movie you tend to  think there may be no such thing.  Jane Campion has done another great film  here, although not as good as the Piano, gets a pretty high mark on its own  as a different, brilliant film.Nicole Kidman stars as Henry James'  headstrong character, Isabel Archer, an American woman who moves to England  to live with her rich uncle (Sir John Gielgud) and aunt (Shelley Winters),  while at this time in her life is desperate to find true love and marry.  After her uncle dies, he leaves her a fortune in his will.  Isabel, now  being the rich woman she is, marries the monstrous Gilbert Osmond (John  Malkovich), who turns her life from pleasant to perhaps utter unhappiness,  all at the hand of Madame Merle (Barbara Hershey--who was nominated for  best supporting actress).The movie surely plays as a &quot;Dangerous  Liaisons&quot; from the victim's point of view, although the film is much  more than that.  For one, this movie is a lot better.  Secondly, the  villians are far more monstrous than revengeful, and finally this movie is  just plain more interesting.  A flaw in this movie is its slowness,  although if you allow yourself to be intrigued by its plot and characters,  this tends not to be a problem (at least it wasn't for me).  It also  depends on how educated you are to enjoy this film, and from my view, a  person has to be somewhat to enjoy this movie in the slightest sense.  Not  to say I'm smarter than everybody else--I had to put the closed captioning  on to read what the characters were saying to keep up with the plot.Once  again, Campion has scored and proven that yes, even a woman, can make a  fantastic motion picture.  I think people should give her more credit (not  to mention she needs to make more movies) because her talent is truly one  that should be noted.

So I will focus instead on some common criticisms of this film.Reviewers lament Campion's psychological simplifications of the theme, or her ungenerous treatment of Isabel as a sufferer of false consciousness who walks blindly into her own trap. On the contrary, I think the director is both adventurous and above-board in stating her revisionist projects from the very opening frame.Henry James lived in the 1880s. His original work was intended as an exploration of what a woman might do if she were given independent means, and his story indicted women as being trapped by a weaker nature.Exploring the same material Campion comes to a different, more ambiguous, but IMHO, also more interesting conclusion. She prefers to establish the film largely as Isabel's subjective experience, not as the story told by some omniscient narrator on whose shoulders falls the onus of proof. This is evidenced, for instance, by a sequence at the beginning where Isabel imagines making love with three different men at the same time.For all its occasional flaws the film is at least internally consistent and proves to me yet again that Campion possesses cinematic imagination in spades. From her comes some of the boldest use of lighting and Black & White interludes I have seen in modern cinema.Net net, don't let the negative reviews put you off, this is a very heart-warming experience even if a languorous one.

420647,AL277B4AQCWBG,6304419708,Steven Reynolds,"[35, 38]","This adaptation of Henry James' technically innovative but infamously dense novel is interesting primarily because director Jane Campion seems to have entirely missed the point.  She's mistaken Isabel Archer for a ""romance addict"" rather than the naive idealist James created.  Perhaps aiming for wider appeal, she tries to turn this from the portrait of a unique female personality into a more general exploration of ""women in love"".  Such universalizing might have worked if she and screenwriter Laura Jones had also had the wherewithal to change the story to suit their modified heroine.  But having ditched the most critical aspect of the novel, they then remain reasonably faithful to its flow of events, with Isabel choosing an ugly, ""sterile dilettante"" (Malkovich) over a handsome lover and a rich English lord (Mortensen and Grant respectively) both of whom are infatuated with her.  For Isabel the ""naive idealist"", such a choice is perfectly understandable.  For Isabel the ""romance addict"", and women in general, such a choice beggars belief.  So this not only fails as an adaptation, it fails as a convincing narrative in its own right.  Screenwriting devotees might be drawn to it wondering just how Jones will convey Isabel's famous interiority without resorting to voiceover.  The answer is simple: she ignores it in the writing (with the exception of one inspired fantasy sequence) and leaves most of it to performance.  The result is that Kidman spends more than half the film in incomprehensible tears.  The novel's Isabel cries once in 600 pages.  For all that, this film is still not without reward: the performances from the near-ensemble cast are universally marvellous, the settings and costumes exquisite, and the music and cinematography are a perfect match for it all.

420648,A33872WCAUCJ60,6304419708,Tracy Davis,"[6, 6]","In Jane Campion's version of Henry James' &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot;, many important elements of the novel are intact: the heroine's search for a life outside of society's strictures, the machinations of the 'villains' in the piece, the ambiguity of certain situations.  However, from the start of the film, I found myself wondering what was going on: the mixture of color, b/w, 'old time' film styles was confusing and unnecessary to what is a period film with a strong enough narrative and point of view.  Even the opening credits made no sense with the rest of the film, and were not tied to anything else.  Nicole Kidman, Barbara Hershey, and John Malkovich are good, but other characters, such as Mary Louise Parker's Henrietta, make no sense if you haven't read the book.  Some of the sequences felt edited to the extent of loss of continuity, and the transformation of Kidman's character into someone looking like Hershey's isn't mentioned, and no one seems to care that Kidman's hair miraculously changes color and texture the minute she is in England.  Disconcerting.  At least Campion took the abrupt and ambiguous ending seriously, although if you haven't read the book, it seems as if the film just ran out of ideas, not to mention steam.
