I was amazed by how deep this movie really goes from its bizzare storyline. It's basically a combination of science-fiction, drama, horror, humor, and yet surprisingly deep emotions are involved between the characters Black and White along with the Yakuza members and aliens. I expected this movie to be good, but it exceeded my expectations by a several miles. The only real downside to this amazing movie for some people would be the fact that they speak Japanese and you have to read subtitles. But if you're a true movie lover you'll check out this astonishing masterpiece. Also worth mentioning, although the character designs aren't the greatest, what will really catch your attention is the surprising detail and artwork that went into creating Treasure Town because of the architecture of buildings in the town.",5,"VERY STRANGE, YET VERY GOOD",1191628800,"10 6, 2007",2007,927,"['would', ""n't"", 'think', 'just', 'looking', 'cover', 'art', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'R-rating', 'put', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'deep', 'movie', 'really', 'bizzare', 'storyline', 'basically', 'combination', 'science-fiction', 'drama', 'horror', 'humor', 'yet', 'surprisingly', 'deep', 'emotions', 'are', 'involved', 'characters', 'Black', 'White', 'Yakuza', 'members', 'aliens', 'expected', 'movie', 'be', 'good', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'several', 'miles', 'only', 'real', 'downside', 'amazing', 'movie', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'fact', 'speak', 'Japanese', 'have', 'read', 'subtitles', ""'re"", 'true', 'movie', 'lover', ""'ll"", 'check', 'out', 'astonishing', 'masterpiece', 'Also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'character', 'designs', 'are', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'what', 'will', 'really', 'catch', 'attention', 'surprising', 'detail', 'artwork', 'went', 'creating', 'Treasure', 'Town', 'architecture', 'buildings', 'town']",Tekkon Kinkreet

1089441,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B000TGCR3I,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[2, 3]","This film is about two street kids Black and White who live in the rundown Treasure Town. Black, the oldest of the boys spend his time taking care of White and beating up anyone endangering his city. Soon the young boys life are disrupted when a Yakuza gang moves in and tries to take over the city. Things are complicated further when the Yakuza brings in a strange looking and brutal man who may be an alien. The story of this movie however is not about the Yakusa, or about aliens or even about White's seaming psychic abilities, it is about the relationship between these two boys, and how the world looks more interesting when one are a child.I found the story to artsy for my tastes, also it is very uneven, at some points it is a slice of life depicting the lives of two street children, then it is science fiction with aliens, then we are in a gangster film and then we have a Spiritual battle for one of the character's soul. The movies is all over the place, some might like this, I do not. The characters however are well made, one start to care about these characters, and everyone, including supporting characters are given a distinctive personality and a unique look.The animation of this film is very good, the film obviously have high production value and everything moves, not like in many anime where only the character's lips moves most of the time. The scenes are very detailed and while I personally did not care for the art style and found the movie frankly to be quite ugly I have to take my hat off to the animators as the movie is skillfully made.I watched the movie with Japanese dialog and English subtitles, I was not impressed, the actors all sounded monotone. The dub might be better I do not know, but the sub at least was not good enough to carry such complex and involving characters.Personally I did not like this film. I think that the movie was far to long, it moved very uneven with long sections where nothing happens and a very confusing storyline. I however have to give the movie credit for being well made, for having great characters and for being a little different compared to most anime movies.",3,"Well made, skillfully animated but confusing storyline.",1292544000,"12 17, 2010",2010,2140,"['film', 'two', 'street', 'kids', 'Black', 'White', 'who', 'live', 'rundown', 'Treasure', 'Town', 'Black', 'oldest', 'boys', 'spend', 'time', 'taking', 'care', 'White', 'beating', 'up', 'anyone', 'endangering', 'city', 'young', 'boys', 'life', 'are', 'disrupted', 'when', 'Yakuza', 'gang', 'moves', 'tries', 'take', 'over', 'city', 'Things', 'are', 'complicated', 'further', 'when', 'Yakuza', 'strange', 'looking', 'brutal', 'man', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'alien', 'story', 'movie', 'however', 'not', 'Yakusa', 'aliens', 'even', 'White', 'seaming', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'relationship', 'two', 'boys', 'how', 'world', 'more', 'interesting', 'when', 'one', 'are', 'child.I', 'found', 'story', 'artsy', 'tastes', 'also', 'very', 'uneven', 'points', 'slice', 'life', 'depicting', 'lives', 'two', 'street', 'children', 'then', 'science', 'fiction', 'aliens', 'then', 'are', 'gangster', 'film', 'then', 'have', 'Spiritual', 'battle', 'one', 'character', 'soul', 'movies', 'place', 'might', 'like', 'do', 'not', 'characters', 'however', 'are', 'well', 'made', 'one', 'start', 'care', 'characters', 'everyone', 'including', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'distinctive', 'personality', 'unique', 'look.The', 'animation', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'obviously', 'have', 'high', 'production', 'value', 'everything', 'moves', 'not', 'many', 'anime', 'where', 'only', 'character', 'lips', 'most', 'time', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'detailed', 'personally', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'art', 'style', 'found', 'movie', 'frankly', 'be', 'quite', 'ugly', 'have', 'take', 'hat', 'animators', 'movie', 'skillfully', 'made.I', 'watched', 'movie', 'Japanese', 'dialog', 'English', 'subtitles', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'actors', 'sounded', 'monotone', 'dub', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'sub', 'least', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'carry', 'such', 'complex', 'involving', 'characters.Personally', 'did', 'not', 'film', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'far', 'long', 'moved', 'very', 'uneven', 'long', 'sections', 'where', 'nothing', 'very', 'confusing', 'storyline', 'however', 'have', 'give', 'movie', 'credit', 'being', 'well', 'made', 'having', 'great', 'characters', 'being', 'little', 'different', 'compared', 'most', 'anime', 'movies']",Tekkon Kinkreet
1089442,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B000TGCR3I,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[25, 27]","If you likeAkira (Special Edition)orGhost in the Shell, and thought they were true masterpieces despite their ambiguous style of storytelling, then you'll love Tekkon Kinkreet. It's as true an anime as there ever was: it follows its own style of storytelling, it has interesting, even endearing characters, and the art is just beautiful. It sits comfortably next to some of the best anime ever to come to the States.Tekkon Kinkreet follows two young boys, known around the city as the Cats, but to each other they are Black and White. Black is a brooding, violent youngster with a gift for taking pain and dishing it out. White is, simply, special; he's empathic, enjoys life, and has a deep sense of when things aren't right. He also seems to be magically gifted. That gift, however, has left White an innocent boy, incapable of growing up and acting his age; that's why Black feels obligated to protect the young boy, and the that means eliminating any possible threat to him and White, as well as the city in which they live. Thus, these two have a few enemies, including the Yakuza, some strange and powerful alien assassins, and a mysterious creature known by the youth in the city as the ""Minotaur."" All the while, the two are continually robbing and mugging those within their city so that they can achieve White's dream of living in a house on a beach....Yeah, interesting, I know. But what makes the story of Tekkon Kinkreet that much better is the surreality of the whole thing. It doesn't try to explain much; it doesn't have to. White and Black can run at tremendous speeds and leap ten feet into the air; aliens exist; and a boy has the power to link himself mentally to his best friend. Why? Because they do.... And all the while, it's as fantastically believable as a well told fantasy novel.Outside of that, the art and characters of Tekkon Kinkreet helps to drive the story along. The settings contains so much detail that it's impossible to find anything. If this was a ""Where's Waldo"" drawing, you'd never find him. The character art is also beautiful, reminiscent of the short sequence inKill Bill, Volume 1.Now, for the one drawback (which many older anime fans wouldn't even consider as a drawback): this will be a very difficult anime for a new-comer to get into. The story isn't difficult to follow, but it can be confusing and the ending leaves a lot unanswered, as is the wont of anime. Still, though, if you have some experience with anime, then you won't be disappointed. The art is beautiful, the story is engaging, and the characters are endearing. I'd rate it higher if it were possible. Tekkon Kinkreet is definitely one of the best anime ever.",5,A True Anime,1191715200,"10 7, 2007",2007,2676,"['likeAkira', 'Special', 'Edition', 'orGhost', 'Shell', 'thought', 'were', 'true', 'masterpieces', 'ambiguous', 'style', 'storytelling', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', 'Tekkon', 'Kinkreet', 'true', 'anime', 'ever', 'was', 'own', 'style', 'storytelling', 'interesting', 'even', 'endearing', 'characters', 'art', 'just', 'beautiful', 'comfortably', 'next', 'best', 'anime', 'ever', 'come', 'States.Tekkon', 'Kinkreet', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'known', 'city', 'Cats', 'other', 'are', 'Black', 'White', 'Black', 'brooding', 'violent', 'youngster', 'gift', 'taking', 'pain', 'dishing', 'out', 'White', 'simply', 'special', 'empathic', 'enjoys', 'life', 'deep', 'sense', 'when', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'right', 'also', 'be', 'magically', 'gifted', 'gift', 'however', 'left', 'White', 'innocent', 'boy', 'incapable', 'growing', 'up', 'acting', 'age', 'why', 'Black', 'obligated', 'protect', 'young', 'boy', 'eliminating', 'possible', 'threat', 'White', 'as', 'well', 'city', 'live', 'Thus', 'two', 'have', 'few', 'enemies', 'including', 'Yakuza', 'strange', 'powerful', 'alien', 'assassins', 'mysterious', 'creature', 'known', 'youth', 'city', 'Minotaur', 'while', 'two', 'are', 'continually', 'robbing', 'mugging', 'city', 'so', 'can', 'achieve', 'White', 'dream', 'living', 'house', 'beach', '.Yeah', 'interesting', 'know', 'what', 'story', 'Tekkon', 'Kinkreet', 'much', 'better', 'surreality', 'whole', 'thing', ""n't"", 'try', 'explain', 'much', ""n't"", 'have', 'White', 'Black', 'can', 'run', 'tremendous', 'speeds', 'leap', 'ten', 'feet', 'air', 'aliens', 'exist', 'boy', 'power', 'link', 'mentally', 'best', 'friend', 'Why', 'do', 'while', 'fantastically', 'believable', 'well', 'told', 'fantasy', 'novel.Outside', 'art', 'characters', 'Tekkon', 'Kinkreet', 'drive', 'story', 'along', 'settings', 'so', 'much', 'detail', 'impossible', 'find', 'anything', 'was', 'Where', 'Waldo', 'drawing', ""'d"", 'never', 'find', 'character', 'art', 'also', 'beautiful', 'reminiscent', 'short', 'sequence', 'inKill', 'Bill', 'Volume', '1.Now', 'one', 'drawback', 'many', 'older', 'anime', 'fans', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'consider', 'drawback', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'anime', 'new-comer', 'get', 'story', ""n't"", 'difficult', 'follow', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'ending', 'lot', 'unanswered', 'wont', 'anime', 'Still', 'though', 'have', 'experience', 'anime', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'art', 'beautiful', 'story', 'engaging', 'characters', 'are', 'endearing', ""'d"", 'rate', 'higher', 'were', 'possible', 'Tekkon', 'Kinkreet', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'anime', 'ever']",Tekkon Kinkreet

1089444,A26O6MQFA36WBK,B000TGCR3I,A Reviewer,"[0, 0]","Based on a Japanese manga and created by a Japanese studio, yet written and directed by Americans, this movie still doesn't lack authenticity like I was worried that it might. The story it tells is fairly universal, focusing on the bond of brotherhood.The 2 main characters, White and Black (friendS? brothers? the movie never really makes it clear) live in Treasure Town, a very vibrant city that's easily one of the most amazing things I've seen in animation. Yet this city, despite looking like a huge playground, is actually a bit of a wreck, where gangs fight for control and where crime is rampant. The first half of the story focuses on Black and White's bonds and their life as the Cats, the gang that owns the city. The second half features a new mob boss entering and attempting to gain control with his alien cohorts who seem nearly invincible.The movie does lose a bit of interest as it beings to verge into the supernatural (those alien things really didn't fit in at all, I didn't think,) and the resolution, involving, like many anime's, a trip inside of the head of the main character, may leave mixed feelings on some viewers. The pacing's a little off as well...the first half may be too slow for some while the 2nd half doesn't ever really stop with the action and the chase scenes, which may wear some down. Still, we have a great anime here where the city's the star of the show. Somehow my favorite scene in the movie takes place during the second half of the credits, where you simply see shots of the city as a song from the Asian Kung-Fu Generation plays in the background. It's an amazing setting and even though it was only made for 5 million dollars, it looks, to me, much better than most hundred-million+ CG movies made today. It's not perfect (Despite the R-rating it seems to play it a bit safe at times...Black never seems to kill his rival gangsters even though the script and direction seems to act like he does,) but it's definitely a movie worth seeing. The first half hour in particular is just stunning.Note; there IS an option for an English dub on the disc. The director (in interviews) has actually recommended the English dub, and while I don't agree with him, I will say that it's much better than the dubs you find in most anime. That said, though, a lot of the dialogue (especially White's) seems extremely corny when spoken aloud in English...and overall it does dampen the story a bit, so I'd recommend the Japanese language with subtitles. If you MUST hear it in English, at least you can be assured that the performances are good and it actually fits fairly well.",4,From here you can see everything...,1215820800,"07 12, 2008",2008,2613,"['Based', 'Japanese', 'manga', 'created', 'Japanese', 'studio', 'written', 'directed', 'Americans', 'movie', 'still', ""n't"", 'lack', 'authenticity', 'was', 'worried', 'might', 'story', 'fairly', 'universal', 'focusing', 'bond', 'brotherhood.The', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'White', 'Black', 'friendS', 'brothers', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'clear', 'live', 'Treasure', 'Town', 'very', 'vibrant', 'city', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'amazing', 'things', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'animation', 'city', 'looking', 'huge', 'playground', 'actually', 'bit', 'wreck', 'where', 'gangs', 'fight', 'control', 'where', 'crime', 'rampant', 'first', 'half', 'story', 'Black', 'White', 'bonds', 'life', 'Cats', 'gang', 'city', 'second', 'half', 'new', 'mob', 'boss', 'entering', 'attempting', 'gain', 'control', 'alien', 'cohorts', 'who', 'seem', 'nearly', 'invincible.The', 'movie', 'lose', 'bit', 'interest', 'verge', 'supernatural', 'alien', 'things', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'resolution', 'involving', 'many', 'anime', 'trip', 'inside', 'head', 'main', 'character', 'may', 'leave', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'viewers', 'pacing', 'little', 'off', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'half', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'slow', '2nd', 'half', ""n't"", 'ever', 'really', 'stop', 'action', 'chase', 'scenes', 'may', 'wear', 'down', 'Still', 'have', 'great', 'anime', 'here', 'where', 'city', 'star', 'show', 'Somehow', 'favorite', 'scene', 'movie', 'place', 'second', 'half', 'credits', 'where', 'simply', 'see', 'shots', 'city', 'song', 'Asian', 'Kung-Fu', 'Generation', 'background', 'amazing', 'setting', 'even', 'was', 'only', 'made', '5', 'million', 'dollars', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'hundred-million+', 'CG', 'movies', 'made', 'today', 'not', 'perfect', 'R-rating', 'play', 'bit', 'safe', 'times', 'Black', 'never', 'kill', 'rival', 'gangsters', 'even', 'script', 'direction', 'act', 'definitely', 'movie', 'seeing', 'first', 'hour', 'particular', 'just', 'stunning.Note', 'option', 'English', 'dub', 'disc', 'director', 'interviews', 'actually', 'recommended', 'English', 'dub', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'will', 'say', 'much', 'better', 'dubs', 'find', 'most', 'anime', 'said', 'though', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'especially', 'White', 'extremely', 'corny', 'when', 'spoken', 'aloud', 'English', 'overall', 'dampen', 'story', 'bit', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Japanese', 'language', 'subtitles', 'MUST', 'hear', 'English', 'least', 'can', 'be', 'assured', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'actually', 'fairly', 'well']",Tekkon Kinkreet

Every inch of the screen will give you something interesting to look at. It's like Hieronymus Bosch in LSD.

For starters the animation absolutely blew me away. It's a seamless blending of traditional and computer generated animation but you can't really tell where one ends and the other begins. You kinda have to see it to understand but it looks stunning when the camera pans around the city. I might compare the backgrounds to Metropolis released about five years ago. The people are drawn in a very simplistic manner which contrasts in an interesting way with the unbelievably detailed and complex landscapes.It's in the story where most Anime fall apart. Generally the problem for me isn't so much that the stories are bad but that they are completely forgettable. Even a classic like Akira had a pretty paper thin plot. Tekkonkinkreet, on the other hand, will likely be difficult to forget in fact it's rather haunting. It's the story of two young street kids named Black and White. They are the epitome of Japanese Yin and Yang. Polar opposites who need each other for balance and when events pull them apart the balance is throw off and violence ensues.What I love about Tekkonkinkreet is how different it is from anything I've seen before and how I felt an actual emotional attachment towards the two boys. I really hoped the movie would give them a happy ending (I won't reveal the outcome). Another cool thing about Anime unlike American animation is the moral ambiguity of the characters. Ironically a movie based on the Manga Black and White isn't so black and white. Even a member of the Yakuza can do something brave, almost heroic. This isn't a movie for children. There is quite a bit of violence which may surprise people given the whimsical cover but it is a great movie and clearly deserving of all the acclaim and film awards it has received.",5,One of my New Favorites,1198713600,"12 27, 2007",2007,1864,"['am', 'so', 'frequently', 'disappointed', 'Anime', 'purchase', 'Tekkonkinkreet', 'was', 'total', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'starters', 'animation', 'absolutely', 'blew', 'away', 'seamless', 'blending', 'traditional', 'computer', 'generated', 'animation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'where', 'one', 'other', 'begins', 'kinda', 'have', 'see', 'understand', 'stunning', 'when', 'camera', 'city', 'might', 'compare', 'backgrounds', 'Metropolis', 'released', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'people', 'are', 'drawn', 'very', 'simplistic', 'manner', 'interesting', 'way', 'unbelievably', 'detailed', 'complex', 'landscapes.It', 'story', 'where', 'most', 'Anime', 'fall', 'apart', 'Generally', 'problem', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'stories', 'are', 'bad', 'are', 'completely', 'forgettable', 'Even', 'classic', 'Akira', 'had', 'pretty', 'paper', 'thin', 'plot', 'Tekkonkinkreet', 'other', 'hand', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'difficult', 'forget', 'fact', 'rather', 'haunting', 'story', 'two', 'young', 'street', 'kids', 'named', 'Black', 'White', 'are', 'epitome', 'Japanese', 'Yin', 'Yang', 'Polar', 'opposites', 'who', 'need', 'other', 'balance', 'when', 'events', 'pull', 'apart', 'balance', 'throw', 'off', 'violence', 'ensues.What', 'love', 'Tekkonkinkreet', 'how', 'different', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'how', 'felt', 'actual', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'two', 'boys', 'really', 'hoped', 'movie', 'would', 'give', 'happy', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'outcome', 'cool', 'thing', 'Anime', 'American', 'animation', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'characters', 'Ironically', 'movie', 'based', 'Manga', 'Black', 'White', ""n't"", 'so', 'black', 'white', 'Even', 'member', 'Yakuza', 'can', 'do', 'something', 'brave', 'almost', 'heroic', ""n't"", 'movie', 'children', 'quite', 'bit', 'violence', 'may', 'surprise', 'people', 'given', 'whimsical', 'cover', 'great', 'movie', 'clearly', 'deserving', 'acclaim', 'film', 'awards', 'received']",Tekkon Kinkreet

Fantastic music by Plaid.Sadly, the plot of the movie quickly descends into the same metaphysical-pseudo-spiritual gobbledeegook that so many feature-length Japanese anime films pass off as high art storytelling.  The metaphors are contrived, sophomoric and paper thin.  Yet, Tekon kinkurto hammers its ""underlying"" themes into over our skull again and again as if it were wielding Black's signature iron pipe.The movie is not wholly un enjoyable- the story of a down on his luck yakuza, turned expectant father Kimura, is much more compelling than the tale of Black and White and the film's only redeeming quality story and character-wise.  Sadly, Kimura is ushered out a good half hour before this mess of a story ends.I cannot recommend this one, not by a long shot.  I'm really surprised at the positive reactions to this film.

I enjoyed in, but it left a gaping whole where I wanted closure. The art style is unique to say the least. The action is brutal, yet subtle. The story is barely even a major factor. This movie is more based off the relationship between Black and White. It obviously is a symbolic representation of Yin and Yang; you must have both to function correctly.Black and White are kids known as the Cats on the streets of Treasure Town. Treasure Town is an extremely undeveloped town, run mostly by the Yakuza. Black and White usually cause havoc while trying to protect their territory and there town. Black is a serious warrior. He develops well throughout the course of our story. At first he is fighting to protect White, but soon we see he has his own demons. White is a slow child. White doesn't do much except act weird. For some reason, he has ""all the screws Black needs."" You will find out what that means through the course of the movie.A new boss takes his place at the top of the Yakuza. He demands that Treasure Town be reborn in his image. He wants amusement parks, casinos, and other moneymaking machines to flood Treasure Town. Obviously, this does not sit well with our ally dwellers, Black and White. Black causes chaos for the Yakuza, which causes them to sent giant super-human type men after them. White is almost killed by one of them and eventually taking away from Black. Black oddly enough, falls to his demons and allows for White to leave. I will leave the rest of the plot to your observational skills.The plot may sound thick, but it isn't as deep as one might think. There is another whole side-story with a man named Rat, a Yakuza member, being caught up in the new plan for the city. He hates it, but knows he can do nothing about it. That story plays a less significant role though. The main picture is more of a man VS himself type plot. Black needs White to keep him in balance. Can Black defeat his demons and return to White? That is the basic concept of the entire movie. I like this idea, but a dense story in the background didn't help this movie out.The art in this movie is great. Everything looks very detailed, except for the actual people. The people have a styles all of their own. They are less detailed, but have a certain appeal to them. This was probably one of my favorite art styles I have seen so far.The extras on this one are a commentary track and a few other small things. There is nothing that I really felt was worth looking at. The film has a great theme, that you need to keep yourself balanced, but a thin story brings this one down for me.

If it's been a while, check out ""Tekkonkinkreet"" (""Treasure Town"") from first time director Michael Arias. This is animation for adults at its best. Visuals are striking, the sound dynamic and genuine, characterization is breathtaking - but you will have to bring along your imagination.Old city citizens, especially those who long to preserve the historic areas of their town, might find a touchstone here. The complex story is based on a manga (graphic novel series) from Taiyo Matsumoto that Arias picked up when he moved to Japan some 17 years ago. The central theme deals with change and how a long established city, such as Tokyo, cannot expand except by tearing down its old structures and neighborhoods. As Arias roamed his new city, he would frequently chance onto a beloved building demolished for new construction.Arias, who has worked in film - primarily creating computer graphics for films like ""The Abyss,"" ""Animatrix"" and ""Princess Mononoke"" - said it was ""Tekkonkinkreet"" that moved him to step into the director's position.The story evolves around the brilliantly colorful ghetto world of two orphaned street brothers, Black and White. Black is the smart, older kid, a survivor intent on taking care of the younger child, White. White is a special charmer, lost in a much younger child's dream world. A developer, Mr. Snake, plans to demolish Treasure Town to build a theme park along the scale of Disneyland or Busch Gardens. He allies with the local yakuza to accomplish this, creating a rift between a profit-loving godfather and a traditional mobster who loves the neighborhood. A pair of sympathetic detectives and other street folk help and hinder as ""Treasure Town"" unfolds.Those used to the superb animation of Miyazaki, will find the Matsumoto's images, handled by animation director Mashiko Kubo, quite different and no less compelling. ""Tekkonkinkreet"" is an amazing blend of CGI and traditional hand-drawn art. It's beautifully complex with sharp detail and vibrant color. As for sound, it is simply amazing. The streets are alive, the soundtrack and voices are perfect. Do yourself a favor and watch this in Japanese with English subtitles. This brilliant, beautiful film slipped by us in its theatrical release.

It was most interesting.  Black also goes through many emotional phases from warrior, to acrobat, to child protector, to emotionally lost.  The character of Kimura also becomes quite moving.  The scene where he has to shoot his mentor is touching.  The animation goes from making us feel like we're on a Tokyo street to the wildly fantastic.

While it is ""made by"" the same folk who did ""The Animatrix"", ""Tekkon kinkreet"" stands alone with it's unique subject matter and presentation. It is akin to a dream. There are elements in the film that suggest this:1) Both Black and White can ""float"" (as well as the ""Alien"" Assassins sent to kill them).2) Looking through White's eyes, it IS hard to delineate reality, especially near the end.3) Some laws of physics don't seem to apply in Treasure Town.Within all this IS a good story, however. There seems to be no ""gray"" area anywhere in the film. Things are very clear-cut: Good and Bad, Black and White, see where I'm going with this? The film becomes a bit surreal at times, but there is never a point at which you might say ""what's happening?"" The separation of Black and White also becomes representative of what happens when those two ""colors"" are removed from the rainbow.This film is quite good.

The story, based on the comic book by Taiyo Matsumoto, focuses on two homeless orphans, one named Black and the other White, who live on the streets of Treasure Town, a seething cauldron of criminality, vice and corruption.  Black fancies himself a superhero crime-fighter, while White, who is given to extrasensory knowledge and visions, dreams of one day moving away from the city and getting a home of their own on the beach.  Thanks to Black's insistence on taking on the bad guys, both youngsters get caught up in a turf war between the Yakuza and some robot-like killers who are duking it out for ownership of the city.Fans of anime will find much to enjoy in this film, which is marked by beautifully detailed urban landscapes, exciting action and chase sequences, occasional lyrical flights into fantasy, and a sometimes touching tale about commitment and friendship centered on the two young boys.  On the other hand, the plethora of characters and occasional narrative incoherence can make it difficult at times to understand what exactly is going on, particularly when the story takes a decidedly metaphysical turn (with imagery taken straight out of ""Contact"") in the final half hour.

But the trance is broken every 15 minutes when you realize the story hasn't really taken you much further than where you started from the beginning.

I'm a casual fan of Anime, but liking it more and more.This story is kind of hard to explain. It's basically of two young boys living by themselves in the big city in the poorest part of town. They are orphans. One older than the other. The older one looking after the young one. It's very depressing and sad through most of the story. Kind of reminds me of the mood in ""Grave of the Fireflys"". A lot of violence as you could imagine.The art work in this is as good as I've seen. Beautiful coloring. You cannot look away it's so good. And the creativity that went into the story along with the art is the best it can be.All I can say is you have to see for yourself. Give it a try. I think you'll like it.Really good music at the end when the credits appear.Very unusual Anime. Highly recommended.

1089477,A2CYMGGXS5QPJT,B000TGCR3I,Yay for Music!,"[2, 2]","This film was recommended to me, and it took me a while to get to a store where I could rent it for the first time. Then shortly following the rental I felt I needed to buy it and watch it a hundred more times. I sat at my computer paying close attention to even the tiniest details. This film is all about precision (See the special features- 300 day documentary about the making).First, this film is about two orphan boys living in a crumbling town called ""Treasure Town."" The focus is all about perspective and how one views the world. While Kuro (Black) has a very dark possessive view of his home town, one that he thinks should never be changed, while Shiro (White) has an imagination and an eye for how the world really should be.The two are endlessly dogged by the Yakuza who want want to change the town into an amusement park (among other things) and make a profit. Kuro fights to preserve ""My Town"" and keep it a place that he can always be the top of and see everything from. Like many other people he wants to keep a sense of security. The world turns upside down with its inner workings and everything in the real town seems so superficial that world and dreams of Shiro seem the most logical option for surviving.The precise colors, time taken for each shot is clearly expressed, nothing in this film is ever missed, all the work is clear cut and every single scene has its meaning.Kuro and Shiro share a lonely life living in broken down car and living off stolen money and goods. Although Kuro lives to care for his friend, he has his reservations about how care free Shiro is and that Shiro doesn't entirely like the way the town is developing. The conflicting feelings and various lenses that they see this world from is amazing.I sat back after seeing this and thought it was an intense but completely necessary violent movie about two kids who just don't want their childhood world to be shattered by the adults. So many themes, ideas, and undertones play into this film that it's open to all viewers.The time, effort, and thought put into this 111 minute film is clear. The sync of the musical score by Plaid and incredible ending sound by Asian Kung Fu Generation and the bizzare world by Mr. Arias makes me want to go be a director, he did an amazing adaptation of ""Black and White"" and transformed it into something else entirely with more graphic images and characters that you don't want to ever forget.If you liked Akira, Steamboy, or like strange, abstract, but intricately woven films, this is the top of the list, and is good for a group of friends or personal viewing.
