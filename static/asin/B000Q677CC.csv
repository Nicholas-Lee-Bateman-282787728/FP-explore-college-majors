1073856,A1MEZNNYI5MQHG,B000Q677CC,"Amazon Customer ""darshan1""","[1, 1]","While there are a few problems with this film, Tara Road is a good depiction of two women recovering from unfair, painful experiences.  Marilyn (Andie McDowell) is an American mother who lost her son to a motorbike accident on his fifteenth birthday.  Meanwhile in Ireland, Ria (Olivia Williams) has just been left by her husband for his pregnant mistress.  Andie McDowell does a terrific job as Marilyn is not an easy character.  Realistically, Marilyn seeks solitude and she's less than friendly to Ria's friends and neighbors when she switches houses with Ria.  McDowell manages to make Marilyn winning anyway and shows her transformation in a nuanced performance. The rest of the cast also did a fine job.What's a bit off about this story is the unrealistic extent to which Marilyn and Ria exchange lives instead of just homes.  Of course, there wouldn't be much of a plot if this didn't occur, but it still rings a bit false that neighbors take up with the women immediately.  There are two occasions where the Irish treat Marilyn as sort of a rare bird because she's American.  However, this takes place in Dublin where in reality visiting Americans aren't exactly scarce.  Furthermore, the movie doesn't shy away from stereotypes as every Irish male in the film is presented as being lecherous, and the two minor gay characters are somewhat flamboyant.  One other odd point is that a minor, undeveloped character who hardly shows up until near the end of the film turns out to be pivotal when it comes time to resolve the major conflict.So while I didn't feel this movie was perfect, there are moments, particularly when Ria's rotten husband, Danny, (played by Iain Glen) was on the screen that I felt very caught up in the story.  Overall, a satisfying experience.  (Note to Americans who have trouble understanding Irish accents:  They aren't at all a problem in this film.)",4,Rewarding,1191283200,"10 2, 2007",2007,1883,"['are', 'few', 'problems', 'film', 'Tara', 'Road', 'good', 'depiction', 'two', 'women', 'recovering', 'unfair', 'painful', 'experiences', 'Marilyn', 'Andie', 'McDowell', 'American', 'mother', 'who', 'lost', 'son', 'motorbike', 'accident', 'fifteenth', 'birthday', 'Meanwhile', 'Ireland', 'Ria', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'just', 'been', 'left', 'husband', 'pregnant', 'mistress', 'Andie', 'McDowell', 'terrific', 'job', 'Marilyn', 'not', 'easy', 'character', 'Realistically', 'Marilyn', 'solitude', 'less', 'friendly', 'Ria', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'when', 'houses', 'Ria', 'McDowell', 'make', 'Marilyn', 'winning', 'anyway', 'transformation', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'did', 'fine', 'job.What', 'bit', 'off', 'story', 'unrealistic', 'extent', 'Marilyn', 'Ria', 'exchange', 'lives', 'instead', 'just', 'homes', 'course', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'plot', 'did', ""n't"", 'occur', 'still', 'bit', 'false', 'neighbors', 'take', 'up', 'women', 'immediately', 'are', 'two', 'occasions', 'where', 'Irish', 'treat', 'Marilyn', 'sort', 'rare', 'bird', 'American', 'However', 'place', 'Dublin', 'where', 'reality', 'visiting', 'Americans', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'scarce', 'Furthermore', 'movie', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'stereotypes', 'Irish', 'male', 'film', 'presented', 'being', 'lecherous', 'two', 'minor', 'gay', 'characters', 'are', 'somewhat', 'flamboyant', 'One', 'other', 'odd', 'point', 'minor', 'undeveloped', 'character', 'who', 'hardly', 'up', 'end', 'film', 'out', 'be', 'pivotal', 'when', 'time', 'resolve', 'major', 'conflict.So', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'movie', 'was', 'perfect', 'are', 'moments', 'particularly', 'when', 'Ria', 'rotten', 'husband', 'Danny', 'played', 'Iain', 'Glen', 'was', 'screen', 'felt', 'very', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'Overall', 'satisfying', 'experience', 'Note', 'Americans', 'who', 'have', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'Irish', 'accents', 'are', ""n't"", 'problem', 'film']",Tara Road

Although it had played in theatres abroad, it was never released for big-screen viewing in US.  Too bad, as I found it most enjoyable and a reminder of how great Maeve Binchy's ""Tara Road"" was as a novel.Although the movie only recounts about the final half of the book, the director has been able to lay open the characters of Marilyn and Ria and expose their deepest hurts in this engrossing tale of crumbling marriages.  Andie McDowell gives an excellent portrayal of the emotionally frozen Marilyn, a Connecticut mother, reeling from the death of her fifteen-year-old son on his birthday.  The surprise gift from his Dad, a motorcycle, leads to his death and causes a wide rift between the parents.  Across the Atlantic at another birthday party in Dublin, the content Ria Lynch (Olivia Williams) learns from her husband Danny (Iain Glen) that he is leaving her for his pregnant girlfriend.  Both women are at the end of their emotional ropes and through a midnight phone call are connected and arrange a house swap.  Believing no problem is so big it can't be run away from, the two women each slip easily into the other's life.  Each learns in her own way that life will never be the same but that doesn't mean it is over.  Binchy's wonderful tale of healing transfers to the screen thanks to outstanding casting, lush scenery, and heartfelt situations.

The special features have some previews and an interview with Maeve Binchy - that's it. There are subtitles for closed captioning and Spanish, but no other audio choices - no Dolby choices or DTS.I have to go on also by saying that I'm not a big Andie MacDowell fan. She always seems a little stilted and plastic to me - this movie is no exception. There's just so rarely any emotion in her face, and it's disconcerting for me. Maeve Binchy's novels are generally OK for me, but she's also not my favorite author, so that may have something to do with it. Olivia Williams as Ria, however, is neatly luminous and a high point for the movie.The beginning of the movie is pretty slow. I understand that we need to know why there's a house exchange, but... Much of the set up just seems somewhat unnecessary. I am a reader and nearly always prefer books to movies - I feel that this slow set-up would have been fine in the book, but movies by necessity have to go faster or they'll end up boring.I just can't help but feel that this was not a book that should have been made into a movie. The cast is good enough, my dislike of Andie aside, it's probably a lovely romantic novel - in fact I have several friends who've told me how much they loved the book - but there's just not enough action to warrant a film. I would say that it reminds me somewhat of ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" - another fine book that didn't translate well to the big screen.

I will say, that if you are a fan of the books, that this will not have the same detail of the book.  The characters are well casted, but not fleshed out as they are in the book, but nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie.The movies two main characters are Marilyn Vine, who lives in Connecticut with her husband, and is grieving over her son's recent death and Ria Lynch, who lives with her two children and husband in Dublin, Ireland and has just found out that he has a pregnant mistress.Through an interesting turn of events Marilyn gets in touch with Ria and they agree to swap houses over a two month period.I found that although the movie was somewhat different from the book in the detail, it was still satisfying watching the two women get used to their new surroundings and understand that even though they were out of their normal lives that they still needed to deal with their problems so that they could heal and move on.  For Marilyn, this means reconciling with her husband and through her insite into Ria's life she becomes grateful for what she does have even though she cannot replace her son.  For Ria, she has her children, and she comes to appreciate them even more when she sees what kind of pain the loss of Marilyn's son has brought her.The casting was excellent, with Andi MacDowell as Marilyn and Olivia Williams as Ria.

1073862,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B000Q677CC,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[4, 4]","Tara Road, based on the Maeve Binchy novel of the same name, follows the parallel lives of two women, one Irish and one American, as they come to terms with loss.  American Marilyn (Andi McDowell) has lost her beloved fifteen year old son to a motorcycle accident, and the all-consuming grief of it drives her from her husband.  Irish Ria (Olivia Williams) faces the devastating news that her husband is leaving her for his pregnant girlfriend despite the family and household he and Ria have built.  When a spontaneous phone call results in a house swap, the two women temporarily slip into the life the other has left behind.The film unfolds in scenes alternating with the same themes, starting with the two birthday parties that each end in loss.  The duality of these scenes works well since the characters and their circumstances are different enough to hold viewer interest and each moves the plot along.  Andi McDowell puts in a competent, if at times overly pinched, performance, while Olivia Williams is radiant and convincing as the transforming Ria.  Stephen Rea stands out in the supporting cast as the charming, sensitive Colm who helps out Ria by planting a garden in her absence and who gives Marilyn the undemanding support she needs.For the first eighty or so minutes, I was surprised by how much I liked this film, with its Irish and New England scenery, telling camera shots, and solid acting.  The drama had none of the syrupy feel-good moments that often accompanies this kind of film, and instead developed gentle moments that nudged the plot forward.  Unfortunately, the end, with its inexcusable deus ex machina, throws all the good out with an improbable--and yes, saccharine--resolution.The DVD has only one special feature, an interview with Maeve Binchy, the author of the novel from which the screenplay was adapted.  Binchy starts off with an involved plot summary even though the viewer most likely has just finished watching it.  Even her account of how the idea came to her is mundane.  She offers no insight, no illumination, nothing that adds to the viewer's appreciation of the story.  I know DVDs are expected to offer more than just the film, but in non-special effect, simple dramas such as Tara Road, there is no point.This film will likely have the men running from the room, while women will find it more entertaining.",3,Chick flick set in Ireland and New England,1192060800,"10 11, 2007",2007,2360,"['Tara', 'Road', 'based', 'Maeve', 'Binchy', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'parallel', 'lives', 'two', 'women', 'one', 'Irish', 'one', 'American', 'come', 'terms', 'loss', 'American', 'Marilyn', 'Andi', 'McDowell', 'lost', 'beloved', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'motorcycle', 'accident', 'all-consuming', 'grief', 'husband', 'Irish', 'Ria', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'devastating', 'news', 'husband', 'leaving', 'pregnant', 'girlfriend', 'family', 'household', 'Ria', 'have', 'built', 'When', 'spontaneous', 'phone', 'call', 'results', 'house', 'swap', 'two', 'women', 'temporarily', 'slip', 'life', 'other', 'left', 'behind.The', 'film', 'unfolds', 'scenes', 'alternating', 'same', 'themes', 'starting', 'two', 'birthday', 'parties', 'end', 'loss', 'duality', 'scenes', 'works', 'well', 'characters', 'circumstances', 'are', 'different', 'enough', 'hold', 'viewer', 'interest', 'plot', 'Andi', 'McDowell', 'competent', 'times', 'overly', 'pinched', 'performance', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'radiant', 'convincing', 'transforming', 'Ria', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'out', 'supporting', 'cast', 'charming', 'sensitive', 'Colm', 'who', 'out', 'Ria', 'planting', 'garden', 'absence', 'who', 'Marilyn', 'undemanding', 'support', 'needs.For', 'first', 'eighty', 'so', 'minutes', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'film', 'Irish', 'New', 'England', 'scenery', 'telling', 'camera', 'shots', 'solid', 'acting', 'drama', 'had', 'none', 'syrupy', 'feel-good', 'moments', 'often', 'kind', 'film', 'instead', 'developed', 'gentle', 'moments', 'nudged', 'plot', 'forward', 'Unfortunately', 'end', 'inexcusable', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'good', 'out', 'improbable', 'yes', 'saccharine', 'resolution.The', 'DVD', 'only', 'one', 'special', 'feature', 'interview', 'Maeve', 'Binchy', 'author', 'novel', 'screenplay', 'was', 'adapted', 'Binchy', 'off', 'involved', 'plot', 'summary', 'even', 'viewer', 'most', 'likely', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Even', 'account', 'how', 'idea', 'came', 'mundane', 'insight', 'illumination', 'nothing', 'viewer', 'appreciation', 'story', 'know', 'DVDs', 'are', 'expected', 'offer', 'more', 'just', 'film', 'non-special', 'effect', 'simple', 'dramas', 'such', 'Tara', 'Road', 'point.This', 'film', 'will', 'likely', 'have', 'men', 'running', 'room', 'women', 'will', 'find', 'more', 'entertaining']",Tara Road

Just take ""The Holiday,"" for example.And in ""Tara Road, it becomes an important event for two women. This movie, adapted from Maeve Binchy's novel, is basically just an Irish/American chick-flick -- a determinedly sugary finale, but with fairly good acting and some truly gorgeous scenery in Ireland.Three thousand miles apart, two women suffer horrific personal tragedies -- Marilyn's (Andie McDowell) son dies in a birthday motorcycle accident, and Ria (Olivia Williams) loses her hubby to his pregnant girlfriend. Given the chance to temporarily switch homes -- and lives -- they both jump at the opportunity. Ria heads for a quiet New England house, while Marilyn heads for Ireland's Tara Road.No, I have no idea why they would swap houses with a total stranger, but still. Both women settle into the other's lives, and as they mourn for children and marriages alike, they begin to bond with new people, and discover new things about themselves. Unsurprisingly, they also get a bit of new closure (especially Ria).I personally have never read a Maeve Binchy novel -- my tastes are funnier, more dramatic, more avant-garde or more fantastical. But ""Tara Road"" will probably appeal to those who liked ""The Holiday"" -- easy labels, charming settings (hey, that's not New England!), and okay acting on all fronts.But director Gillies MacKinnon seems a little confused -- is he making a women's weepie or a cuddly comedy? The plot has some elements of both, being sentimental one minute and wryly funny the next -- sort of a Lifetime comedy. The main weakness is the ending, a rather absurd showdown between various characters that magically fixes all that is still wrong.But along the way, you do get some very beautiful Irish scenery and pretty little looks at the title location. The New England scenery was kind of weird, though -- that obviously isn't New England at all.Olivia Williams gives a lovely performance as the wronged wife, who struggles to heal from her problems; Andie McDowell gives a steady, rather ordinary performance. Most of the other characters are easy cliches, though -- the caddish hubby, the mistress, the quirky friends, the gay guys, et cetera, et cetera.

You'll know the premise from reading the Amazon description: a jilted wife and a grieving mother exchange houses so that they can get away from their sorrows for a while, which is similar to the premise of the more light-hearted (and far more enjoyable) ""The Holiday."" The two women in this story came across as stupid and rude. I found it annoying and unpleasant that both of them were so willing to invade each other's personal space (on arrival, one on them even rifles through the other woman's underwear drawer). Annoying, too, that it takes more than half the movie for the Irish woman to ask WHY the American was so upset.They're both surrounded by supporting characters who are stereotypes at best, almost all of them unlikeable to the point where I wanted to throw expensive vases at them (as the Irish woman finally does to her ignorant boor of a husband).I read the novel ""Tara Road"" some time ago, and I honestly don't remember disliking it, probably because the length of the story allowed for some fleshing out of the characters, making it understandable why they act the way they do.

1073865,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000Q677CC,Grady Harp,"[9, 9]","TARA ROAD is a thickly populated movie that reaches for the female audience and succeeds in addressing old problems of infidelity and marriage conflicts.  The problem is the story by highly published Irish author Maeve Binchy (adapted from Binchy's novel for the screen by Cynthia Cidre) is 'used goods' and while there are many moments of touching dialog there are equal moments of sham resolutions that in the end prove disappointing despite the cast of actors portraying these only occasionally interesting characters.Two women, each bruised by life events, trade homes (Dublin, Ireland and Connecticut) to find the space to recover. In Connecticut, Marilyn (Andie MacDowell) is recovering from the accidental motorcycle (a birthday gift from his father Greg - August Zirner) death of her young son: grief has made her withdraw and lose her feelings for Greg.  In Dublin, Ireland Ria (Olivia Williams) is blissfully happy in her beautiful home on Tara Road  which she shares with her two children and her newly discovered unfaithful husband Danny (Iain Glen) - a lothario who has had affairs with Ria's best friend Rosemary (Maria Doyle Kennedy) and now confesses to the pregnancy of his current mistress Bernadette (Heike Makatsch).  In too quick an instance Ria and Marilyn decide to swap homes with the hope that separation form their families will give them room to readjust to life. Each woman encounters the friends and neighbors of the other: Marilyn meets restaurateur Colm (Stephen Rea) among Ria's odd assortment of acquaintances while Ria encounters the brother of Greg and some intrusive and over the top friends of Marilyn.  Gradually it all comes to a very predictable conclusion that simply solves too many problems too easily.Director Gillies MacKinnon seems to have difficulty deciding how to maintain a tone for the film - a tearjerker versus a situation comedy. There are moments when the audience connects with some of the characters, but these are too few and separated by far too many stretches of weak writing. Despite some fine acting the movie never quite flies.

You know the story by now--two women going through emotional turmoil exchange houses and end up changing their lives, in both cases for the better. But for some excellent acting, I would have given this film one star. I've always liked Andie McDowell's classic but unconventional looks; no longer rail-thin and with a few wrinkles, I thought she was quite good here. There's a scene where she literally howls her grief by the side of the pool where her son died that was very powerful, as is the scene when she describes that death for the first time to others. I also liked Iain Glen as Ria's husband--a nice enough seeming guy at the outset, his character becomes sleazier by the minute, and his looks and manner reflect it. But the plot is weak, and the supporting actors don't ring true--Ria's Irish neighbors are stereotypes, and Marilyn's crazy friends are improbable for such a buttoned-up sort of woman. And the ending is a deus-ex-machina wave of the wand--a minor character comes out of the woodwork to solve all. Life isn't so simple, and if we could transform our lives by changing houses for a few months, we'd all be doing it regularly.

Director Gilles MacKinnon helmed numerous European television productions; and ""Tara Road"" has a made-for-TV feel.  Andie McDowell won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association award for Best Actress in 1988 for ""Sex, Lies & Videotape.""  She was nominated for Golden Globe Best Actress awards in 1990 for the romantic ""Green Card"" & in 1994 for ""Four Weddings & a Funeral.""  As Marilyn Vine, she didn't have the depth of grief I saw in the character, more of a nervous energy. During her most emotional moment of grieving by the pool, MacKinnon sets the camera far back to frame the moment from her husband Greg's perspective, keeping us at a distance from her.  If you compare that scene to Marcia Gay Harden's similar grief scene in the filmThe Invisible, that director brings us close in to what is a wave of pain and sorrow.  The bottom line is that McDowell comes across in this film as more of a plot point than an engaging character whose emotions grab us and drag us into her world.Olivia Williams was in ""Peter Pan"" in 2003,Mood Swingersin 2001, and ""The Sixth Sense"" in 1999.  As Ria Lynch, she seems like a vulnerable house frow who's lost most of her attractiveness.  The change that occurs in Ria from the shattering experience of divorce to finding inner strength seems more described that portrayed.  As with McDowell, we observe her circumstance, but are never fully grabbed into her frightening uncertainty of change.Iain Glen won the Silver Bear award for Best Actor at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1990 for ""Silent Scream.""  He appeared in ""Gorillas in the Mist"" in 1988 and ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" in 2001.  This is a guy who is supposed to be an exceptional salesman that is so attractive to the ladies that he can be married to one and conduct affairs with two others concurrently.  Glen just wasn't that man.  Therefore, all of the craziness that swirls about him seemed staged rather than emotionally possible.Stephen Rea played Colm who owns the neighborhood restaurant on Tara Road.  He was nominated for an Oscar in 1992 for ""The Crying Game.""  Here, he's a sympathetic guy, but he's not who I pictured as the attractive man that peaks Marilyn's interest and almost makes her cross the line away from her husband from which there'd be no turning back.Maria Doyle Kennedy played the best friend Rosemary.  The screenplay does not embellish that she is the successful businesswoman.  Kennedy worked with Jon Voight in the 1998 film ""The General.""  Here, she does a nice job at the end, but really isn't eye-shatteringly lovely enough to make all the other girls jealous.  She has a hard edge to her face with an unflattering hair style that was totally wrong for the part.  Her eye makeup in the restaurant scene looked like Yvonne DeCarlo in ""The Munsters.""  This critical role was so mishandled that it's hard for the story to really have the emotional impact it needs to work.Heike Makatsch as the Danny's pregnant girlfriend Bernadette could have phoned in her performance.  Sara Bolger as Annie and Jean-Marc Barr as Andy turn in nice performances.  Brenda Fricker who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for ""My Left Foot"" in 1989 does a good job as Mona, the boss' wife who salvages the Tara Road real estate company.I very much enjoyed seeing the cultures of Dublin and New England.  The story was interesting much in the way you wonder how a puzzle will come together.  As a film, this was emotionally chilly, but still worth viewing.

However, I am always open to new things, so I thought I would give this film a try.  I kept my expectations reasonably low, and was actually quite surprized at how enjoyable this movie was.The story follows two women, one of them, Marylin (played by Andie Mcdowell), who is comfortably rich in New England, she just lost her only son and will not even admit that it happened.  She is destitute and will not talk about it with anyone.  Then there is Ria (played by Olivia Williams), a very conservative, shy, and ""happily"" married woman in Ireland.  Her husband breaks the news that he is having a child with another woman and is leaving her, of course this destroys her idealistic existence.  It is at this time that Marylin calls Ria based on some business Marylins husband did with Ria's husband and they decide to swap houses since they are both so miserable.Probably the main problem I found with this film was the way everyone just seemed to be ""following the story"".  Marylin calls in the middle of the night (In Ireland), and yet Ria seems to be more than happy to swap houses.  The way the characters act just seems to be there only to serve the purpose of the plot (such as when Marylin reveals her sons death to Ria's children).  I also found the way that characters flew half-way across the world on whims highly improbable.  Especially Ria, because she isn't well-off like Marylin.However, despite these complaints, I still found this to be an enjoyable film because, and often-times it is true that a change of scenery does help us heal much quicker and come out of our comfort zones.  I also liked the fact that these characters didn't find the need to jump into bed with random men to get out of their sorrow (Ria almost does).  It was also nice to see a movie that was still mature, and didn't have excess sexual content or profanity.I do not think I would own this movie if I didn't get it for free, but it is still a enjoyable enough to rent and watch at least once.God Bless & *ENJOY* ~Amy",4,"Loss, Love, and House Swapping!",1190764800,"09 26, 2007",2007,2106,"['Had', 'never', 'heard', 'Tara', 'Road', 'Maeve', 'Binchy', 'did', 'know', 'was', 'film', 'version', 'However', 'am', 'always', 'open', 'new', 'things', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'film', 'try', 'kept', 'expectations', 'reasonably', 'low', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'surprized', 'how', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'story', 'two', 'women', 'one', 'Marylin', 'played', 'Andie', 'Mcdowell', 'who', 'comfortably', 'rich', 'New', 'England', 'just', 'lost', 'only', 'son', 'will', 'not', 'even', 'admit', 'happened', 'destitute', 'will', 'not', 'talk', 'anyone', 'Then', 'Ria', 'played', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'very', 'conservative', 'shy', 'happily', 'married', 'woman', 'Ireland', 'husband', 'news', 'having', 'child', 'woman', 'leaving', 'course', 'idealistic', 'existence', 'time', 'Marylin', 'Ria', 'based', 'business', 'Marylins', 'husband', 'did', 'Ria', 'husband', 'decide', 'swap', 'houses', 'are', 'so', 'miserable.Probably', 'main', 'problem', 'found', 'film', 'was', 'way', 'everyone', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'following', 'story', 'Marylin', 'middle', 'night', 'Ireland', 'yet', 'Ria', 'be', 'more', 'happy', 'swap', 'houses', 'way', 'characters', 'act', 'just', 'be', 'there', 'only', 'serve', 'purpose', 'plot', 'such', 'when', 'Marylin', 'sons', 'death', 'Ria', 'children', 'also', 'found', 'way', 'characters', 'flew', 'half-way', 'world', 'whims', 'highly', 'improbable', 'Especially', 'Ria', ""n't"", 'well-off', 'Marylin.However', 'complaints', 'still', 'found', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'often-times', 'true', 'change', 'scenery', 'help', 'heal', 'much', 'quicker', 'come', 'comfort', 'zones', 'also', 'liked', 'fact', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'need', 'jump', 'bed', 'random', 'men', 'get', 'sorrow', 'Ria', 'almost', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'mature', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'excess', 'sexual', 'content', 'profanity.I', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'would', 'own', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'free', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'rent', 'watch', 'least', 'once.God', 'Bless', '*ENJOY*', '~Amy']",Tara Road

1073879,A2Z1TPSSZHN5BB,B000Q677CC,N.,"[2, 2]","I'd like to be perfectly candid with you: this movie is more deserving of two than three stars, but I cannot bring myself to rate it so lowly. Why? It's a question of expectation, and my hesistance to subvert it (for a very similar situation, see my review of _The River King_ DVD).One's expectations are rightly high upon reading the back cover of this DVD. We have a screenplay based on a best-selling Maeve Binchy novel; an all-star international cast including Andie McDowell, Olivia Williams, and no less than Stephen Rea; a cutesy if gimmicky transatlantic house-swap premise; and a capable Scottish director. So, by the time you've popped this in the player, your expectations are or should be fairly high.That's why the let-down, when it comes, is a blow. The acting abilities of almost every actor are severely tested here. Olivia Williams comes off the best; she is believable, at least, as a woman whose philandering husband turns her cozy world upside down. Andie MacDowell--well, I have few words to describe how disappointing, unsympathetic, and emotionally unresonant her performance here is. A real pity, because she is lovely to watch, with a beautiful face that is naturally expressive but which, here, is bafflingly blank, even after her character's warming ""catharthis"" points.A bevy of fine, veteran Irish actors (Maria Doyle Kennedy, Brenda Fricker)are given short shrift with poor characterization and dialogue. Ah, the dialogue--wooden, clunky, and full of pregnant pauses. I do not include in the ""fine"" category the teenage actress playing Ria's daughter Annie; her scenes and dialogue are amongst some of the least believable, most poorly delivered in the film, and the movie suffers for it (she's an important character).The director erred--grossly--in using *these* Irish/British and South African actors to play Americans. The characters are caricatures, one-dimensional and with poor American accents to boot. (The accent and acting of pan-Euro Jean Marc Barr alone are disorienting in the extreme). The choice to try to get wide panoramic shots of the ""New England"" neighborhood mystifies me, given that the scenery in the background is so clearly southeast African (it screams ""safari"").And the ending--that deus ex machina ending that is straight out of a situation comedy, not the emotionally layered scenarios Binchy is capable of creating in her better novels.I am smacking my head against my forehead, wondering ""Why?"" Why was a movie with so much potential given such painfully poor treatment? Why were the actors not on their game (and these actors are not exactly C-list)? Why were the situations treated with so little nuance as to come off as absurd and hackneyed--the cheating boss, the cheating husband, the Waiting to Exhale wronged-wife moment, the Other Woman subplots...?So, it is with a heavy heart that I cannot recommend _Tara Road_ to people who, like me, had reasonably high expectations of it. What I *can* do is recommend it to people who expect no more than a transatlantic/Irish ambience, scenes--but not thoughtful explorations-- of family dysfunction, and a mild revenge-of-the-wife vindication sub-plot.If those are your only expectations, you may just like this film, and more power to you; I really hope you do.",3,"Oh, dear...""expectation adjustment"" needed",1206576000,"03 27, 2008",2008,3274,"[""'d"", 'like', 'be', 'perfectly', 'candid', 'movie', 'more', 'deserving', 'two', 'three', 'stars', 'can', 'not', 'bring', 'rate', 'lowly', 'Why', 'question', 'expectation', 'hesistance', 'subvert', 'very', 'similar', 'situation', 'see', 'review', '_The', 'River', 'King_', 'DVD', '.One', 'expectations', 'are', 'rightly', 'high', 'reading', 'back', 'cover', 'DVD', 'have', 'screenplay', 'based', 'best-selling', 'Maeve', 'Binchy', 'novel', 'all-star', 'international', 'cast', 'including', 'Andie', 'McDowell', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'less', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'cutesy', 'gimmicky', 'transatlantic', 'house-swap', 'premise', 'capable', 'Scottish', 'director', 'So', 'time', ""'ve"", 'popped', 'player', 'expectations', 'are', 'should', 'be', 'fairly', 'why', 'let-down', 'when', 'blow', 'acting', 'abilities', 'almost', 'actor', 'are', 'severely', 'tested', 'here', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'best', 'believable', 'least', 'woman', 'philandering', 'husband', 'cozy', 'world', 'upside', 'down', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'well', 'have', 'few', 'words', 'describe', 'how', 'disappointing', 'unsympathetic', 'emotionally', 'unresonant', 'performance', 'here', 'real', 'pity', 'lovely', 'watch', 'beautiful', 'face', 'naturally', 'expressive', 'here', 'bafflingly', 'blank', 'even', 'character', 'warming', 'catharthis', 'points.A', 'bevy', 'fine', 'veteran', 'Irish', 'actors', 'Maria', 'Doyle', 'Kennedy', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'are', 'given', 'short', 'shrift', 'poor', 'characterization', 'dialogue', 'Ah', 'dialogue', 'wooden', 'clunky', 'full', 'pregnant', 'pauses', 'do', 'not', 'include', 'fine', 'category', 'teenage', 'actress', 'playing', 'Ria', 'daughter', 'Annie', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'are', 'amongst', 'least', 'believable', 'most', 'poorly', 'delivered', 'film', 'movie', 'suffers', 'important', 'character', '.The', 'director', 'erred', 'grossly', 'using', '*these*', 'Irish/British', 'South', 'African', 'actors', 'play', 'Americans', 'characters', 'are', 'caricatures', 'one-dimensional', 'poor', 'American', 'accents', 'boot', 'accent', 'acting', 'pan-Euro', 'Jean', 'Marc', 'Barr', 'alone', 'are', 'disorienting', 'extreme', 'choice', 'try', 'get', 'wide', 'panoramic', 'shots', 'New', 'England', 'neighborhood', 'mystifies', 'given', 'scenery', 'background', 'so', 'clearly', 'southeast', 'African', 'safari', '.And', 'ending', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'ending', 'straight', 'situation', 'comedy', 'not', 'emotionally', 'layered', 'scenarios', 'Binchy', 'capable', 'creating', 'better', 'novels.I', 'am', 'smacking', 'head', 'forehead', 'wondering', 'Why', 'Why', 'was', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'given', 'such', 'painfully', 'poor', 'treatment', 'Why', 'were', 'actors', 'not', 'game', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'C-list', 'Why', 'were', 'situations', 'treated', 'so', 'little', 'nuance', 'come', 'off', 'absurd', 'hackneyed', 'cheating', 'boss', 'cheating', 'husband', 'Waiting', 'Exhale', 'wronged-wife', 'moment', 'Other', 'Woman', 'subplots', 'So', 'heavy', 'heart', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', '_Tara', 'Road_', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'reasonably', 'high', 'expectations', 'What', '*can*', 'do', 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'expect', 'more', 'transatlantic/Irish', 'ambience', 'scenes', 'not', 'thoughtful', 'explorations', 'family', 'dysfunction', 'mild', 'revenge-of-the-wife', 'vindication', 'sub-plot.If', 'are', 'only', 'expectations', 'may', 'just', 'like', 'film', 'more', 'power', 'really', 'hope', 'do']",Tara Road

The film deals with the grief that two women face in two different circumstances and countries.  Marilyn Vine (Andie MacDowell) lives in Connecticut, and is still coming to terms with the death of her son, Dale (Chris Jacko Olckers).  While in Dublin, Ireland, Ria Lynch (Olivia Williams) experiences infidelity; her husband, Danny (Lain Glen), admits to her to having an affair with Bernadette (Heike Makatsch), a woman who is pregnant with his child.  One evening Marilyn makes arrangements with Ria to swap homes, and their journey begins.The movie moves quickly, but shows viewers how both women slowly overcome their grief.  The women are not alone, and in the process, they do not live paralyzing lives.  The interesting aspect about the film is that none of the women revealed why they felt the need to swap homes.  However, it is only when Marilyn and Ria spend time with both of the women's respective family and friends, that they slowly discover the truth of their circumstance.

True, the script leaves much to be desired, but Andie McDowell and the rest of the cast does an excellent job of resurrecting the emotions of the characters.

Each of them is looking for something new in her life and so they connect and swap houses (this reminds me of the movie 'The Holiday').The movie waivers between sad and comic as it progresses through the experiences of each mother's new experiences with culture, emotional transformations and eventually leads to the average Hollywood's SWEET'N SOUR ending where each discovers herself in her own way.An okay-movie to spend a weeknight, but not good enough for much more than that.Other recommendations: `The Holiday', `About a Boy', `Love Actually'.",3,Hollywood's SWEET'N SOUR ending,1192320000,"10 14, 2007",2007,1037,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'quality', 'acting', 'movie', 'True', 'script', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'Andie', 'McDowell', 'rest', 'cast', 'excellent', 'job', 'resurrecting', 'emotions', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'story', 'mother', 'Connecticut', 'child', 'motorcycle', 'accident', 'day', '15th', 'birthday', 'right', 'front', 'eyes', 'mother', 'Ireland', 'cold', 'shoulder', 'husband', '10', 'years', 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'life', 'so', 'connect', 'swap', 'houses', 'movie', 'Holiday', '.The', 'movie', 'waivers', 'sad', 'comic', 'experiences', 'mother', 'new', 'experiences', 'culture', 'emotional', 'transformations', 'eventually', 'average', 'Hollywood', 'SWEET', 'N', 'SOUR', 'ending', 'where', 'discovers', 'own', 'way.An', 'okay-movie', 'spend', 'weeknight', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'much', 'more', 'that.Other', 'recommendations', 'Holiday', 'Boy', 'Love', 'Actually']",Tara Road

Fifteen-year-old Dale Vine (Christ Jaco Olckers) is tragically killed at his own birthday party while riding a motorbike given to him by his father.  Dale's mother, Marilyn (Andie MacCowell), can't cope with the death and goes into a deep depression.  She decides she needs to get away and makes a phone call overseas to find out about a possible house switching.  Meanwhile, across the Atlantic Ria Lynch (Olivia Williams) is informed at her son's birthday party that her husband Danny (Iain Glen) is leaving her for his pregnant mistress, Bernadette (Heike Makatsch).  Ria is attempting to deal with this news when she receives a phone call from Marilyn.  Deciding to take things into her own hands, Ria agrees to the house-switch.  She goes to America and Marilyn comes to the house at Tara Road in Ireland.  Though separated by thousands of miles, the women become connected as they bond with each other's friends and family, learning the secrets that each one holds, and gaining strength from the kindness of their new surroundings and the strangers that become friends.TARA ROAD is a chick-flick without much romance.  Marilyn goes to Ireland to figure out her life and falls more in love with her husband.  Meanwhile, Ria comes to America and realizes what a jerk her husband has been.  The movie doesn't offer any deep messages really and isn't a tear-jerker.  It can best be described as an ""adult coming of age story"".  The acting is solid across the bar.  It's also incredibly short with a run-time of just over ninety-minutes.The DVD includes a trailer for the film, an interview with author Maeve Binchy, and some other trailers.

So I was pleasently surprise at how much I enjoyed this film.  It is one of those films I would describe as an ""enjoyable little film"".The film does not try to be something it is not; it is a story about two women at a crossroads in their separate lives and how friendship can move them past tragedies in their lives.The two lead characters are interesting in that you have an American lady who has closed herself off from everyone who wants to help her after the death of her son.  We also have an Irish lady (Ria) who after finding out about her husband's infidelity looks to friends and family for support, only to find they blame her for his affairs (or at least that is how she feels). By switching lives for short period of time they both hope they can find the answers they need.The story is entertaining and I enjoyed the performances by most of the supporting actors.  Unfortunately I did not enjoy the performances of the leading actors; Andie McDowell and Olivia Williams.  Andie's performance just did not seem to fit this character.  There were moments when her character would look into the camera and you would expect her to convey the emotion of the moment, but it was not there.I think part of the problem may have been with the directing or the storytelling.  Their seemed to be pieces missing, especially in Ria's life in America.  I have not read the book so if there are parts of the story missing they were lost in the movie.Neither of the lead women seemed to capture the tragedies that happened in their lives, they just seemed odd.

For those fans of Binchy's detailed plot and in-depth storytelling, you'll be disappointed for the movie [with its inherent time constraints] is not altogether cohesive in telling the story , but it does a fine job of entertaining nonetheless, thanks in large part to the strong cast.The story examines the lives of two women - American Marilyn Vine [the stunning Andie Macdowell] who is grieving over the tragic loss of her 15-year-old son in a motorcycle accident at home [on his birthday]. Marilyn is unable to come to terms with her loss and feels a desperate need to get away. Then there is Irish Ria Lynch [Olivia Williams] who seems to have a wonderful family, but is shattered when her husband Danny [Iain Glen] reveals that he is leaving her for his pregnant mistress Bernadette.The two women connect over an inadvertent phone call and decide to swap homes for two months, and during the course of this time, they learn to come to terms with their circumstances. But Tara Road is not merely about coming to terms - there are so many sub-plots involving the other characters in the story, such as Colm, the gentle restaurant owner who tries to help Marilyn whilst she is in Dublin. Ria's best friend, who seems genuine and sincere, but is she really, and a whole host of other characters.Though the book was a tightly-woven plot that explored the various characters in detail, the movie fails to deliver in that aspect. Don't get me wrong, it is interesting enough, and makes for a pleasant afternoon viewing - but, it does not give us tremendous insight into the main characters, perhaps with the exception of Marilyn Vine [in part due to Andie Macdowell's acting skills]...even Ria's wronged wife doesn't elicit that much sympathy, in part because of her forgiving nature towards her cad of a husband for most of the movie.To be fair, the novel was quite intricate and that takes a lot of work to translate onto the big screen. All in all though, I would suggest reading the novel to enhance one's enjoyment of the movie, and to discover more about some of the minor characters, and how they all interconnect in the story.",3,Good casting makes up for the less than cohesive plot.,1191888000,"10 9, 2007",2007,2248,"['Having', 'been', 'long-time', 'fan', 'Maeve', 'Binchy', 'works', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'see', 'Tara', 'Road', 'made', 'movie', 'fans', 'Binchy', 'detailed', 'plot', 'in-depth', 'storytelling', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', '[', 'inherent', 'time', 'constraints', ']', 'not', 'altogether', 'cohesive', 'telling', 'story', 'fine', 'job', 'entertaining', 'nonetheless', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'strong', 'cast.The', 'story', 'lives', 'two', 'women', 'American', 'Marilyn', 'Vine', 'stunning', 'Andie', 'Macdowell', ']', 'who', 'grieving', 'tragic', 'loss', '15-year-old', 'son', 'motorcycle', 'accident', 'home', '[', 'birthday', ']', 'Marilyn', 'unable', 'come', 'terms', 'loss', 'desperate', 'need', 'get', 'away', 'Then', 'Irish', 'Ria', 'Lynch', '[', 'Olivia', 'Williams', ']', 'who', 'have', 'wonderful', 'family', 'shattered', 'when', 'husband', 'Danny', '[', 'Iain', 'Glen', ']', 'leaving', 'pregnant', 'mistress', 'Bernadette.The', 'two', 'women', 'connect', 'inadvertent', 'phone', 'call', 'decide', 'swap', 'homes', 'two', 'months', 'course', 'time', 'learn', 'come', 'terms', 'circumstances', 'Tara', 'Road', 'not', 'merely', 'coming', 'terms', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'sub-plots', 'involving', 'other', 'characters', 'story', 'such', 'Colm', 'gentle', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'who', 'help', 'Marilyn', 'whilst', 'Dublin', 'Ria', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'genuine', 'sincere', 'really', 'whole', 'host', 'other', 'book', 'was', 'tightly-woven', 'plot', 'explored', 'various', 'characters', 'detail', 'movie', 'deliver', 'aspect', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'interesting', 'enough', 'pleasant', 'afternoon', 'viewing', 'not', 'give', 'tremendous', 'insight', 'main', 'characters', 'perhaps', 'exception', 'Marilyn', 'Vine', '[', 'part', 'due', 'Andie', 'Macdowell', 'acting', 'skills', ']', 'even', 'Ria', 'wronged', 'wife', ""n't"", 'elicit', 'that', 'much', 'sympathy', 'part', 'forgiving', 'nature', 'cad', 'husband', 'most', 'movie.To', 'be', 'fair', 'novel', 'was', 'quite', 'intricate', 'lot', 'work', 'translate', 'big', 'screen', 'would', 'suggest', 'reading', 'novel', 'enhance', 'one', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'discover', 'more', 'minor', 'characters', 'how', 'interconnect', 'story']",Tara Road
