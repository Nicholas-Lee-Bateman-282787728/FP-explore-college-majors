No, its not thought provoking humor but then its not trying to be either.Watch as Gilligan foils yet another rescue attempt.  Look at the number of castaway look-alikes that coincidentally show up on the island.  See the number of ""guest stars"" that come and go yet the castaways somehow remain stranded.We don't care that the Professor can build a radio out of a coconut but can't repair a hole in the boat.  All we care about is ""Ginger or Mary Ann?"" None of it makes any sense.  It's not supposed to.

904027,A65XH6L5BUX0X,B0009E322U,"TheClassicsNut65 ""morgan miller""","[0, 0]","Though I must give credit to ""The Beverly Hillbillies"", ""Green Acres"", ""Petticoat Junction"", ""I Dream of Jeannie"", ""The Lucy Show"", ""The Addams Family"", ""Bewitched"", ""The Andy Griffith Show"", ""That Girl"", and several other shows for making the 1960s one of the best decades (if not the best decade!) in television, I must admit that ""Gilligan's Island"" (CBS; 1964-1967) stands out far beyond the rest. After a year of trying to get his series on the air, ""Gilligan's Island"" creator Sherwood Schwartz was finally accepted by CBS to debut his series in the fall of 1964. Though he had to recast three roles (Ginger, the Professor, and Mary Ann) before the show's premiere and was unliked by the network, Schwartz retained faith in his and that it would work. The series premiered on Saturday, September 26, 1964 at 8:30 PM. The series although it was greeted with negative press was an instant hit in the ratings, topping of its first year at #17 in the ratings. The show was renewed for a second year in 1965 and was converted to color for the 1965/1966 television season. The series remained popular throughout its second year, reaching #19 for the season. However, when CBS placed the sitcom a weak Monday night timeslot in its third season (1966-1967) the show's ratings soon dropped out of the top 30 shows. Even though the show's viewership had declined, CBS had still planned to renew the series for a fourth season. However, when CBS head William S. Paley found out that his employees had cancelled the long-running ""Gunsmoke"" in favor to renew ""Gilligan's Island"", he became desatisfied. He exclaimed that ""Gunsmoke"" was his (and his wife's) favorite show and arguably the best show on television. In pleasing Mr. Paley, CBS dropped ""Gilligan's Island"" and revamped ""Gunsmoke"", which would run for several more years.This series contains season introductions for all three seasons and several other bonus features. One of the best is the short documentary ""Gilligan's Island: A Cultrual Phenomenon"" which is located on the last disk of season three. The disks are double-sided (which is unpleasing to some). All 98 original episodes, unedited, are included. Unlike other television shows, the first season remains in black-and-white like when it originally aired.Some of the sitcom's best include the season one episodes: ""Two on a Raft"", ""The Big Gold Strike"", ""Wrongway Feldman"", ""Angel on Island"", ""So Sorry, My Island Now"", ""Gilligan Meets Jungle Boy"", and ""Forget Me Not"". The season two best episodes include: ""Beauty Is As Beauty Does"", ""The Little Dictator"", ""The Sweeptakes"", ""Castaway Pictures Presents"", ""Don't Bug the Mosquitoes"", ""Erika Tiffany-Smith to the Rescue"", ""The Postman Cometh"", ""Forward March"", ""Feed the Kitty"", ""Operation: Steam Heat"", and ""The Friendly Physician"". And last but not last, the third season includes some of the best rememberred episodes: ""Up at Bat"", ""The Producer"", ""Topsy-Turvy"", ""The Invasion"", ""The Kidnapper"", ""All about Eva"", ""Court-Martial"", ""Lovey's Secret Admirer"", ""The Second Ginger Grant"", ""The Secret of Gilligan's Island"", ""It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's Gilligan!"", and ""Gilligan, the Goddess"".If you like old, clean, and way better than today's sitcoms, I suggest you purchase this complete box set of ""Gilligan's Island"" and or any of the others that I've mentioned.
