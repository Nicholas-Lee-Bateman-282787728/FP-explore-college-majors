1087286,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B000SQFC0O,A. Gammill,"[6, 6]","Family Ties really began to hit its stride in the 1983-84 season.  There are many standout episodes, including Alex as Scrooge in ""A Keaton Christmas Carol""; Alex & Mallory's trip to Princeton (""Go Tigers""); another memorable guest apperance by Tom Hanks (""Say Uncle""), to name just a few.The real treat in this set is the inclusion of several bonus features, after the bare-bones release of season one.  ""The Making of Family Ties"" offers both recent and vintage interviews with the cast.  Unfortunately, neither Meredith Baxter-Birney or Justine Bateman take part in the new material.  Michael Gross and Michael J. Fox talk with pride and passion about the show, and you may not even recognize Tina Yothers now.There is also another brief segment with Fox, and ""The Year of the Beard,"" in which Gross waxes nostalgic on his choice to grow a beard during the summer 1983 hiatus.  Episode promos are an added bonus, and really took this viewer back to those great NBC Thursday nights.As Marc ""Skippy"" Price puts it, Family Ties is the perfect 80's time capsule.  Yet, it doesn't really seem that dated.  The humor and heart of the show are timeless.

1087289,AR3BZOTB7IY78,B000SQFC0O,Anton Karidian,"[0, 0]","I believe that as of the second season, Family Ties was a GOOD family sitcom, but not a great one. I should note that I'm judging from the first 2 seasons, which are the only ones I've seen. In the second season, the story ideas are good, but the writing quality is uneven. The cast is good, with the standout being Michael J. Fox as Alex. I found the second season of Family Ties to be just mildly funny. For one thing, I often saw a gag coming before it happened and that drained much of the humor away. The picture and sound quality are fine, although I should note that I watched these on a standard definition TV.There are several second season episodes that I enjoyed a lot. I thought that ""A Keaton Christmas Carol"" was a good and funny adaptation of the Dickens story. ""Lady Sings the Blues was also one of my favorites. ""The Graduate"" gave us a look at Alex's ego problem, and a realistic ending where he had learned how to suppress that. Episodes like these show how good Family Ties can be, but there aren't enough great episodes in the second season to make it a great series.I was disappointed that politics was fading away by the second season. I had heard that the show focused on political and social issues as ""All in the Family"" did. The first season had a fair amount about politics and political issues, like the episode where Steven's father came to visit, and the political differences between them led to a big conflict. However, in the second season politics is just occasionally mentioned, and only 2 episodes focus on it. ""Ladies Man"" deals with the Equal Rights Amendment, but even there the story is really more about how Alex treats a girl who is an ERA supporter. And ""Lady Sings the Blues"" focuses on Elyse singing folk songs like ""Blowing in the Wind"" with their social and political implications. For some reason, by the second season the producers decided to have Family Ties deal mostly with family issues. The opening credits of Family Ties reflect this change in emphasis, since the opening credits in the first season include several scenes of the parents' counterculture past, but by the second season such scenes are gone. Focusing on family issues is fine too, but I had hoped for a more political show.The second season DVD set has several nice extras. Especially good is the featurette on ""The Making of Family Ties"" that includes comments by producers and cast. There are also interesting segments on ""Michael J. Fox: The Best Gig in the World"" and ""The Year of the Beard"" (about Michael Gross's decision to grow a beard for the second season). As I said earlier, I have not seen Family Ties beyond the second season. I'm going to watch into the third season soon because I do enjoy the show and I think the first 2 seasons show a lot of promise. (Update - I've now seen a lot of seasons 3 and 4, and the writing quality of the show improved markedly after season 2. The first 2 seasons have a lot of good episodes, but beginning with season 3 I'd rate Family Ties as a great sitcom.)",3,"Good Family Sitcom, Yet Politics Fading Away",1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,3028,"['believe', 'second', 'season', 'Family', 'Ties', 'was', 'GOOD', 'family', 'sitcom', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'should', 'note', ""'m"", 'judging', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'are', 'only', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'second', 'season', 'story', 'ideas', 'are', 'good', 'writing', 'quality', 'uneven', 'cast', 'good', 'standout', 'being', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'Alex', 'found', 'second', 'season', 'Family', 'Ties', 'be', 'just', 'mildly', 'funny', 'one', 'thing', 'often', 'saw', 'gag', 'coming', 'happened', 'drained', 'much', 'humor', 'away', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'fine', 'should', 'note', 'watched', 'standard', 'definition', 'TV.There', 'are', 'several', 'second', 'season', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'thought', 'A', 'Keaton', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'was', 'good', 'funny', 'adaptation', 'Dickens', 'story', 'Lady', 'Blues', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'favorites', 'Graduate', 'gave', 'look', 'Alex', 'ego', 'problem', 'realistic', 'ending', 'where', 'had', 'learned', 'how', 'suppress', 'Episodes', 'show', 'how', 'good', 'Family', 'Ties', 'can', 'be', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'great', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'make', 'great', 'series.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'politics', 'was', 'fading', 'away', 'second', 'season', 'had', 'heard', 'show', 'focused', 'political', 'social', 'issues', 'All', 'Family', 'did', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'fair', 'amount', 'politics', 'political', 'issues', 'episode', 'where', 'Steven', 'father', 'came', 'visit', 'political', 'differences', 'led', 'big', 'conflict', 'However', 'second', 'season', 'politics', 'just', 'occasionally', 'mentioned', 'only', '2', 'episodes', 'focus', 'Man', 'Equal', 'Rights', 'Amendment', 'even', 'story', 'really', 'more', 'how', 'Alex', 'girl', 'who', 'ERA', 'supporter', 'Lady', 'Blues', 'focuses', 'Elyse', 'singing', 'folk', 'songs', 'Blowing', 'Wind', 'social', 'political', 'implications', 'reason', 'second', 'season', 'producers', 'decided', 'have', 'Family', 'Ties', 'mostly', 'family', 'issues', 'opening', 'credits', 'Family', 'Ties', 'reflect', 'change', 'emphasis', 'opening', 'credits', 'first', 'season', 'include', 'several', 'scenes', 'parents', 'counterculture', 'second', 'season', 'such', 'scenes', 'are', 'gone', 'Focusing', 'family', 'issues', 'fine', 'too', 'had', 'hoped', 'more', 'political', 'show.The', 'second', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', 'several', 'nice', 'extras', 'Especially', 'good', 'featurette', 'Making', 'Family', 'Ties', 'comments', 'producers', 'cast', 'are', 'also', 'interesting', 'segments', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'Best', 'Gig', 'World', 'Year', 'Beard', 'Michael', 'Gross', 'decision', 'grow', 'beard', 'second', 'season', 'said', 'earlier', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Family', 'Ties', 'second', 'season', ""'m"", 'going', 'watch', 'third', 'season', 'soon', 'do', 'enjoy', 'show', 'think', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'show', 'lot', 'promise', 'Update', ""'ve"", 'now', 'seen', 'lot', 'seasons', '3', '4', 'writing', 'quality', 'show', 'improved', 'markedly', 'season', '2', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'have', 'lot', 'good', 'episodes', 'beginning', 'season', '3', ""'d"", 'rate', 'Family', 'Ties', 'great', 'sitcom']",Family Ties: Season 2

So with fond memories  I ordered this set.  However, as is sometimes the case, memories didn't quite live up.  At this point (about 5 episodes into it), the scenarios are pretty silly, there's a lot of bad jokes.. It's got it's moments, and kind of feels like seeing an old friend but unlike some programs that I buy more than one season of (Cheers, Three's Company, Sopranos) I think one season of Family Ties is gonna do it for me.  I don't know, there's still something about the show.. could be that opening song.  I guess I don't regret buying it.  And it's getting better as I reach the 6th episode (Speed Trap).. I'd give this episode alone 4 or 5 stars while the five episode before that 3.  I'll probably watch disc 2.*** OK, I just finished watching the rest of the season and it was great. I've just ordered Season 3.  I will say although I wasn't that impressed with most of the episodes on disc 1, Family Ties hits its stride in disc 2 and keeps up the great writing and acting for most of the rest of the season.  I was hooked midway through disc 2 and finished the rest of the set within a week.  Great show and great to revisit Alex P Keaton and the family again.  He was so intelligent and had such a charisma, as did the mother and everyone actually.  Great show, lots of extras, and definitely deserves more than my stingy 3 stars.

Tighter, more purpose-driven scripts with crisper comedic elements combine with a main cast who is really finding their collective chemistry.  While Michael J.

Here, Mr. Fox's Alex P. Keaton is confronted with an attraction to liberal free spirit Carrie Newman, a temporary houseguest of the Keatons.  This is a problem for the more buttoned-up Alex, and the great script is both humorous and poignant.A telltale creative innovation this season is finding excellent stories for the core actors and solid ones for the suppporting cast.

1087300,A1P2DHHCZ3K6JP,B000SQFC0O,O. B. Tryggvason,"[3, 4]","The second season of Family Ties flows better than the first one and this is a really heartwarming and funny sitcom.Michael J. Fox is clearly the star here and his Alex P. Keaton is an irresistable character. He can be smug, arrogant, insensitive and downright mean but he always sees the errors of his ways and in the end is a completely likable character. Michael Gross, the weakest link on the first season, is much better here (and he looks much better with that beard) and the rest of the cast is good.Mostly these are fluff episodes on the second season that are enjoyable but on occasion they deal with important issues. Tom Hanks is outstanding as Uncle Ned who it turns out has a serious drinking problem. Steven Keaton considers having an affair and I felt that episode handled that situation well enough. The least favorite here is the christmas episode where Alex sees the future ""Scrooge"" style.The supporting character Skippy is starting to grow on me, I found him quite intolerable in the first season.All in all, as a family sitcom Family Ties scores high. It's nice, cute and always enjoyable. A nice escape from the harsh realities of the real world.",4,The Keaton's grow on you,1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,1168,"['second', 'season', 'Family', 'Ties', 'better', 'first', 'one', 'really', 'heartwarming', 'funny', 'sitcom.Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'clearly', 'star', 'here', 'Alex', 'P.', 'Keaton', 'irresistable', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'smug', 'arrogant', 'insensitive', 'downright', 'mean', 'always', 'errors', 'ways', 'end', 'completely', 'likable', 'character', 'Michael', 'Gross', 'weakest', 'link', 'first', 'season', 'much', 'better', 'here', 'much', 'better', 'beard', 'rest', 'cast', 'good.Mostly', 'are', 'fluff', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'occasion', 'deal', 'important', 'issues', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'outstanding', 'Uncle', 'Ned', 'who', 'out', 'serious', 'drinking', 'problem', 'Steven', 'Keaton', 'having', 'affair', 'felt', 'episode', 'handled', 'situation', 'well', 'enough', 'least', 'favorite', 'here', 'christmas', 'episode', 'where', 'Alex', 'future', 'Scrooge', 'style.The', 'supporting', 'character', 'Skippy', 'starting', 'grow', 'found', 'quite', 'intolerable', 'first', 'season.All', 'family', 'Family', 'Ties', 'high', 'nice', 'cute', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'nice', 'escape', 'harsh', 'realities', 'real', 'world']",Family Ties: Season 2

1087302,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B000SQFC0O,Taheen Lopez,"[2, 3]","This 1983-84 Season of FAMILY TIES is when this show about a midwestern family and their move in the USA from the cultural liberism of the 1960's and 1970's to the conservation of the 1980's which particularly expressed through the relationship between young Republican Alex Keaton(Michael J. Fox), the materialistic young lady Mallory(Justine Bateman), the athletic tomboyish Jennifer(Tina Yothers), the independent architect Elyse(Meredith Baxter), and the local TV station manager Steven(Michael Gross)that all lived in suburban Columbus, Ohio.This 1983-1984 Season also takes me back to memory lane to when I used to watch FAMILY TIES at 8:30 PM right after THE FACTS OF LIFE at 8PM every Wednesday night on NBC which was of course before FAMILY TIES was moved to Thursdays on Thursday January 5, 1984.As a matter of fact; this was the season when NBC had moved FAMILY TIES from Wednesday nights to Thursday nights since it was moved to Thursdays in the Winter of 1984 in the middle of its 2nd Season.FAMILY TIES was also an instant smash when it made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1982 and had even won numerous awards, including 3 consecutive Emmy Awards for Michael J. Fox as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series along with the fact that FAMILY TIES ran on NBC from 1982-89 with 180 episodes throughout its whole 7-year run.This 1983-1984 Season also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 11 years old in the 5th grade and when NBC's motto was ""BE THERE"", which was NBC's slogan from the Fall of 1983 thru the Spring of 1984.FAMILY TIES also had a lot of Hollywood stars appear on this show before they were famous and/or during the early years of their acting career like*Courtney Cox whom is best known for her role as Monica Geller on FRIENDS had co-starred as Alex's girlfriend(Lauren Miller)in the last 2 seasons of FAMILY TIES*Christina Applegate whom is best known for her role as the ditzy blonde bombshell(Kelley Bundy)on MARRIED WITH CHILDREN had appeared as Jennifer's pal(Kitten)in the episode ""Band On The Run""*Tom Hanks appeared in the first 2 seasons as Elyse's alcoholic kid brother(Ned)*River Phoenix had appeared in Season 4 as a 14-year old math-whiz who develops a crush on Jennifer after a math tutoring session with Alex*Stephen Baldwin whom is the youngest Baldwin brother appeared as a member of a therapy group Alex and his girlfriend attended*Corey Feldman appeared as a 7th-grade classmate of Jennifer's in the episode ""The Disciple""*Crispin Glover whom is known for his role as the geeky George McFly in the
