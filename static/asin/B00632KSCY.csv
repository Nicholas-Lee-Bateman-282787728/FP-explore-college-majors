1508887,A37SFXAWN1CXO0,B00632KSCY,"Doug Danzeisen ""frankfan42""","[1, 1]","This is an absolute bargain at this price, three great westerns for one low price.  I could almost not believe it when I saw this set at this price, and went no further until I bought the set, right then and there. As a movie lover I am so glad that I did, you will be too, here's why-The Searchers 1956- Wayne plays an ex-Confederate soldier seeking his niece, captured by Comanches who massacred his family. He won't surrender to hunger, thirst, the elements or loneliness. And in his five-year search, he encounters something unexpected: his own humanity. This is, IMHO, one of John Ford, as well as star John Wayne's best movies, and this video transfer is the best I have ever seen the movie look, it is simply stunning and looks as fresh and crisp as I imagine a sixty year old movie could be made to look. Wonderful--This is a movie that transcends its genre and shows Wayne in top form as an actor and Ford in fine form as well.How the West Was Won-- 1962Epic and episodic tale of the development of the American West from the 1830s through the Civil War to the end of the century, told through the eyes of a pioneer  Prescott family. As they struggle with danger and adventure the family learns some life lessons and they are witnesses to history unfolding around them, The real star of the movie is the visuals, this movie was the last 3 strip Cinerama feature film made and looks absolutely stunning. I have read that the costume department had to hand stitch the clothes worn by cast members as the Cinerama process would show the machine stitches. In fact, the whole movie is loaded with this kind of attention to detail, and the result is absolutely beautiful and appears quite authentic. Since TVs don't have the huge 146 degree curved screen that Cinerama has the pictures are seamlessly digitally ""Stitched"" together. Add to this mix a star studded cast with an engaging and immersive storyline and you will find this movie captures you for the duration. There is also an added treat, the entire movie is presented in the stretched version, but there is also an additional disc which has the movie in a ""Smilebox""  format that approximates the curving nature of the Cinerama format. What a treat, and makes me want to visit the Cinerama dome in Seattle to watch this on one of the Cinerama screens.The Wild Bunch 1969-- Made near the end of a cycle of traditional westerns, its one of the best. An aging group of outlaws  is looking for the last big score.  Lots of good acting, beautiful scenery and some rather breathtaking shots. This movie is somewhat a book end for the end of an era in Western film making, and Sam Peckinpah really brings this story to life, and the movie has become so much a canon that it is rumored that a remake is in the works. A really good , well done movie.Conclusion- this set is a real bargain, in an era when real bargains are few. .There are wonderful movies, in fact two of them have never been equaled IMHO, and they surpass just being ""Westerns"" into becoming great landmark films. Who ever blu lighted this release loves movies. You won't be sorry you bought this, as all these movies stand up to repeated screenings very very well. God Bless ya!",5,This set is a bargain for all movie lovers,1386460800,"12 8, 2013",2013,3202,"['absolute', 'bargain', 'price', 'three', 'great', 'westerns', 'one', 'low', 'price', 'could', 'almost', 'not', 'believe', 'when', 'saw', 'set', 'price', 'went', 'further', 'bought', 'set', 'right', 'then', 'there', 'movie', 'lover', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'here', 'why-The', 'Searchers', '1956-', 'Wayne', 'ex-Confederate', 'soldier', 'seeking', 'niece', 'captured', 'Comanches', 'who', 'massacred', 'family', 'wo', ""n't"", 'surrender', 'hunger', 'thirst', 'elements', 'loneliness', 'five-year', 'search', 'something', 'unexpected', 'own', 'humanity', 'IMHO', 'one', 'John', 'Ford', 'as', 'well', 'star', 'John', 'Wayne', 'best', 'movies', 'video', 'transfer', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'look', 'simply', 'stunning', 'fresh', 'crisp', 'imagine', 'sixty', 'year', 'old', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'look', 'Wonderful', 'movie', 'genre', 'Wayne', 'top', 'form', 'actor', 'Ford', 'fine', 'form', 'well.How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', '1962Epic', 'episodic', 'tale', 'development', 'American', 'West', '1830s', 'Civil', 'War', 'end', 'century', 'told', 'eyes', 'pioneer', 'Prescott', 'family', 'struggle', 'danger', 'adventure', 'family', 'life', 'lessons', 'are', 'witnesses', 'history', 'unfolding', 'real', 'star', 'movie', 'visuals', 'movie', 'was', 'last', '3', 'strip', 'Cinerama', 'feature', 'film', 'made', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'have', 'read', 'costume', 'department', 'had', 'hand', 'stitch', 'clothes', 'worn', 'cast', 'members', 'Cinerama', 'process', 'would', 'show', 'machine', 'stitches', 'fact', 'whole', 'movie', 'loaded', 'kind', 'attention', 'detail', 'result', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'quite', 'authentic', 'TVs', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'huge', '146', 'degree', 'curved', 'screen', 'Cinerama', 'pictures', 'are', 'seamlessly', 'digitally', 'Stitched', 'together', 'Add', 'mix', 'star', 'studded', 'cast', 'engaging', 'immersive', 'storyline', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'duration', 'also', 'added', 'treat', 'entire', 'movie', 'presented', 'stretched', 'version', 'also', 'additional', 'disc', 'movie', 'Smilebox', 'format', 'curving', 'nature', 'Cinerama', 'format', 'What', 'treat', 'want', 'visit', 'Cinerama', 'dome', 'Seattle', 'watch', 'one', 'Cinerama', 'screens.The', 'Wild', 'Bunch', '1969', 'Made', 'end', 'cycle', 'traditional', 'westerns', 'one', 'best', 'aging', 'group', 'outlaws', 'looking', 'last', 'big', 'score', 'Lots', 'good', 'acting', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'rather', 'breathtaking', 'shots', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'book', 'end', 'end', 'era', 'Western', 'film', 'making', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'really', 'story', 'life', 'movie', 'become', 'so', 'much', 'canon', 'rumored', 'remake', 'works', 'A', 'really', 'good', 'well', 'done', 'movie.Conclusion-', 'set', 'real', 'bargain', 'era', 'when', 'real', 'bargains', 'are', 'few', 'are', 'wonderful', 'movies', 'fact', 'two', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'equaled', 'IMHO', 'surpass', 'just', 'being', 'Westerns', 'becoming', 'great', 'landmark', 'films', 'Who', 'ever', 'blu', 'lighted', 'release', 'movies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sorry', 'bought', 'movies', 'stand', 'up', 'repeated', 'screenings', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'God', 'Bless', 'ya']",Searchers / Wild Bunch / How the West Was Won

1508889,A1RD28AX6JTXE6,B00632KSCY,Homer Charles,"[1, 1]","Three of the greatest westerns ever.  The SEARCHERS is my favorite western of all time and it is in about the top five films off all pictures I have ever seen.  Why John Wayne didn't get the best actor oscar is beyond me.  Wayne didn't play the typical John Wayne part in the film.  And, who can forget the opening scene, and the closing scene. The Door Opens going from complete black to Mounument Valley to receive Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) and then at the end of the movie the Door Closes on Monument Valleym back to total black, with John Wayne walking out into the desert.  The performance of Hank Warden as the mentally-challenged adult is worth the award of Best Supporting Actor.  Favorite Warden Line:  &#34;We thank you O' Lord for what we are about to receive.&#34;  Well, what they are about to receive is about two hundred mad as hell Indians in an attack.The other two films are excellent as well and HOW THE WEST WAS WON has been repaired and refurbished and has had the two bars of the three separate cameras that was part of the original Cinerama process removed.  You can make out the connections once in a while but if you have ever seen the original you are in for a real treat with this Blu-ray treatment.  In fact, all three movies are spectacularly sharp and the sound is great.The WILD BUNCH is a real shootum-up and about the most shootum-up of just about any western.

Morrow ""Hey Now!""","[1, 1]","While The Searchers and The Wild Bunch are much darker films than HTWWW, I'm pretty thrilled to have all three on Blu-ray for such a reasonable price. It is three discs, not all 3 movies crammed onto one disc, but the extras from any 2 disc special editions are not included. The Searchers looks spectacular, as well as being one of Wayne's finest performances. The cinematography has always been stunning, but even better here. This is the best that I've ever seen the Wild Bunch as well. But the most improved award goes to HTWWW. While the ""cinerama effect"" is not 100% gone (there is a version that apes the curved screen effect of Cinerama)those awful lines are pretty much invisible now. Not completely, but it doesn't ruin the viewing, as it had on every other version I saw up until now. This movie see-saws between touching and sappy, between historical and fanciful, and some of the dialogue is downright funny in all the wrong places, but I saw this in Cinerama in 1962 and loved it. Of course I was 8 years old, but I've loved it ever since, warts and all.
