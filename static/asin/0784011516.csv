So formulaic and pretentious, in the way that they have to explain every little thing to you. As if they think the story is so twisted and hard to follow.A group of twenty something spoiled rich kids kidnap a mobster (Walken). They need his connections and money to save one of the kid's sister, who has been kidnapped because of some gambling debt. They realize they have gotten in over their heads. Can they figure out how to get the sister back, and release the mobster, so that they don't all end up dead?

Sounds simple enough, but there is a big twist...don't try and guess it, even I didn't see it coming.  All in all `Suicide Kings' is a decent film, nothing spectacular, and while it tries to treed Tarantino waters it begins to sink after we reach the meat of the film.  Really, the main reason to watch this film is for Christopher Walken who is probably one of Hollywood's most dependable supporting actors around (I mean come on, it's almost as if he appears, even if only for a moment, in like every movie made nowadays).  Denis Leary also does a good job with his stock role, but it's Walken who makes the movie memorable.

75456,ASKUZHOKQ1W3E,0784011516,"Dane R. Youssef ""surfur""","[0, 0]","by Dane Youssef&#34;Tarantinoesque (adj) &#8211; referring to or reminiscent of the work of the American film-maker and actor Quentin Tarantino (born 1963), known for the violence and wit of his films.&#34; --Collins English DictionaryTarantino never set foot in a film school. He might not even have taken TV Media in high school. But... he started writing, directing and acting--and he still changed the genre. With &#34;Reservoir Dogs,&#34; he was established. With &#34;Pulp Fiction,&#34; he was God.Hollywood is like high school. When one does something that really gets popular, it sparks... the trend. And all the others follow suit--following the leader like cult lemmings. And in film, influence can be essential. Or just sad and embarrassing. Tarantino inspired many--a lot of particular imitators. Some good. And... as for this one?&#34;SUICIDE KINGS&#34; dares to spin a yarn of a quartet of wealthy privileged youngsters who dream up... and then try the most desperate and daring of schemes--they abduct an ex-Wiseguy.The reformed mobster is on his way home one night after an invigorating evening out. There's an ambush, he's attacked. He comes to... only to find himself bound-and-gagged in a chair somewhere. What the hell's going on?A hostage film. A mob-crime flick. And also eventually... kind of mystery &#34;whodunnit?&#34; thriller, the plot twists and turns--especially in the last quarter of the picture.Just a bunch of boys having fun. Bein' boys--not unlike &#34;Reservoir Dogs&#34;, &#34;Pulp Fiction&#34; and &#34;Django Unchained.&#34;&#34;The Godfather in question&#34; finds in a cabin somewhere surrounded by rich collegiate in nice suits who seem to fancy themselves their own independent Mafioso. He sees red--on someone's shirt, as it's covered in the Goodfella's blood. The whole plan goes as wrong as we'd expect and the spoiler richies panic--and then these dumb rich silver spoons all turn on each other.There's a bit where they cut off the mobster's finger (remember the cop's ear in &#34;Reservoir Dogs&#34;?) The mob is infamous for this. There's a moment where two henchman talks about his shoes--White Nikes, Bruno Mackie's and Stingray Boots, (the discussion of Big Macs and McDonald's in Holland vs. America), these kidnappers are all in fine suits (Tarantino's henchman always were too).The standard big-heist/kidnapping/robbery/caper genre picture has been a staple of cinema since before movies could speak. And in the '30's, the genre reached its zenith.&#34;SUICIDE KINGS&#34; boasts one of those casts that we'd expect from the latest Tarantino picture. Christopher Walken, Laura Harris, Jeremy Sisto, Brad Garrett, Jay Mohr, Johnny Galecki, Sean Patrick Flanery, Henry Thomas, Laura San Giacomo and Dennis Leary.OK, not quite the highest-of-profile names for the most part. But still, everyone does a worthwhile job. Only Walken, Leary and Galecki only really stand-out.Christopher Walken confirms the belief that any scene he's in--just flat-out works. Even when the screenplay gives him the most ludicrous insights: &#34;But I come from out there, and everybody out there knows, everybody lies: cops lie, newspapers lie, parent's lyin'. The one thing you can count on - word on the street... yeah, that's solid.&#34; Uh-huh. That's why so many schoolyard and water-cooler rumors are considered holy fact.Denis Leary has the most fun in his role doing what I suppose can best be described as &#34;the quintessential Denis Leary role.&#34; He's &#34;Denis Leary in the mob.&#34; Ranting about his wife and his expensive footwear. Doing a good deed and then bring down his usual Biblical wrath.Galecki is kind of fun as the rich worrywart nebbish whose family owns the place and seems a lot more concerned with mud being tracked on the floor, what happening to his father's favorite chair than the fact that a mobster is bound and he know everyone's nameAll the other actors--they get a passing grade, but they don't quite stand out. And at times, &#34;SUICIDE KINGS&#34; is like that--hit-and-miss.The whole abduction is so badly planned out--the movie itself even takes notice of this. At one point in the movie, Walken's character says to his captors: &#34;You guys didn't think this through too good, did you?&#34; Anyone with a handful of working brain cells will be thinking the same thing. I kind of wanted to ask the filmmakers this. The amount of obvious mistakes these guys make. Oh, they're clearly not professionals.These guys kidnap a man with mob connections. They let him know who they are. They introduce themselves to him at the beginning. Really get to know each other. Of course they have to get to know each other, take their walls down and open up... it's integrate to films like these for male bonding--or rather, character development.You'd think they would have blindfolded him, or be masked themselves. They drop their names. Surely they don't honestly believe they're going to get away with this. And then, is there really a possibility that... how Walken attempts to get out of this... or they do. Even in a god-dammed movie....The movie's screenwriters Josh McKinney, Gina Goldman and Wayne Allen Rice take Don Stanford's original short story &#34;The Hostage&#34; from and heavily &#34;Quentin Tarantino-ize it.&#34; Some thought they paid homage real proper. Some thought all this seems like something at best he might have in the bottom of his drawer--and forgot about forever. The scribes here don't seem to have quite that golden ear. It's not quite tin....Director Peter O' Fallon has real flair and style. He certainly films this thing with a lot of energy to spare. The kind we've seen best in... well, you know where.Heist/kidnapping movies that deal with &#34;inside jobs&#34; just gotta have that moment where the ship's going down in flame and the rats all turn on each other.There's even the plot development where they all turn on each other, trying to find out who the traitor is, the mole feeding the cops the info is--remember the last act of &#34;Reservoir Dogs&#34;? Where all of the criminals go nuts, pull out their guns and...&#34;SUICIDE KINGS&#34; is nice, fun and disposable. The most memorable thing about it is Walken taped down in a chair. And that's only of the best ways to get Waken. The filmmakers know that.In the end, most of it is forgettable. Kind of fun (especially the comic stuff), but no, really nothing especially special. No must-see classic. Well, what do you expect from a designer imposter Tarantino?I agree--a little too much (and I mean from beginning to end) is recycled from Tarantino. Except I don't think Q.T. himself ever rotoscoped.And Tarantino himself admits to being a big-time movie imitator--one of the very best there ever was. But when he plagiarizes, he knows damn well how to make it feel fresh. He steals from the best of the old school. But he has that golden ear, that Beethoven savant.&#34;SUICIDE KINGS&#34; is still worth a look for a slow night. Better than a lot of the merde being #$%$ out of Hollywood's big uncreative anus. &#34;Suicide Kings&#34; doesn't beat the house and take the pot, but like poker, it's not a bad way to spend a slow night with your friends.Oh come on, people. It's obvious why they're trying to make designer-imposter Quentin Tarantino. Hollywood is like high school. Show them something most'll get into and watch the trend spark. Before you knowAudiences are just like that--more of the same until they get really sick of it. Couldn't the real criminals here--the culpable screenwriters Josh McKinney, Gina Goldman and Wayne Allan Rice have maybe given this just one more re-write? Or honestly, maybe a few. Should've gotten an expert team of script doctors. Quentin got his personal style by stealing from a lot of different sources. The mistake here--they're just taking directly from Quentin.But director O' Fallon gives a lot of wild-child style and so does everyone else involved.I have to say... it is fun. It is a lot a fun. But it is kind of disposable. Better than the average throwaway movie you watch to fill or kill the time on a slow Tuesday night for a buck from Redbox. The picture does have a nice mood and atmosphere--Designer Imposter Tarantino or not.And in the end... Well... Yeah, it's true. This is all pretty unbelievable. The ending however, is inevitable. And makes all the sense in the world.It's funny how this movie bombed when it first came out. Maybe cause 1997 was the year of &#34;Titanic,&#34; &#34;L.A. Confidential,&#34; &#34;Good Will Hunting&#34; and &#34;The Ice Storm.&#34; And a real Tarantino film--&#34;Jackie Brown.&#34;From &#34;Reservoir Dogs&#34; to &#34;Pulp Fiction.&#34; Hey, if the writers and director had waited a little later, they could have pilfered a little from Quentin's &#34;Jackie Brown&#34; which came out later that year around Christmas. It is a real Hell of a wild ride, Tarantino-esque or not. Like Doug Liman's &#34;Go.&#34;See, for me--The Suicide Kings seems more like Jon Favreau's &#34;Swingers&#34; than the Reservoir Dogs. Hey, maybe that was another source of inspiration!Walken sees how nervous they all are (who wouldn't be?) and attempts to get them to turn on each other. Seeing as it's a typical hostage situation with the victim being tied to a chair--he tries the usual of divide-and-conquer. &#34;There's an inside guy. A mole,&#34; he tells them. &#34;But who?&#34; When they do finally start playing poker, Walken reads them easily.You might have to see it more than once to really get it all straight. Take notes, if you have to.Not to give anything away at all, but just to close it all on this one poetic line: &#34;Sometimes the ends really do justify the means. Or at least define the meaning of the words 'karma' and 'justice'.&#34;--Having Really Enjoyed It, Dane Youssef",4,"""The Best--Or Worst Way To Kill Yourself?""",1388534400,"01 1,

I figured I should give it a shot-the cast was worth the price tag and I knew that I would drop at least $4 to rent it anyhow.  I am glad I did.  ""Suicide Kings"" is an intelligent mobster movie that, as many viewers have commented, follows in the shadow of Tarantino's films.  The unpredictable violence of the film, particularly on behalf of Denis Leary, keeps you on the edge and in a state of tension.  Christopher Walken's performance holds the entire movie together.  To witness how he perfectly plays his unfortunate situation is like watching a master at work.  By the end of the film, every one of his kidnappers is ready to buy him a drink-and I am as well.  On top of Walken's performance, I was really impressed by Johnny Galecki, who had me laughing in every scene he appeared.A few criticisms.  While the dialogue in this film is pretty good, there is absolutely no plot.  In movies that employ these devices, the dialogue must be absolutely top notch.  I was never bored during this film, but the script could have used a bit more ""oomph.""  Additionally, the editors did not seem to know how to end the film.  There are many twists in the plot in the final moments of the film (as one might expect), but there is one too many in my opinion.  Due to this fact, the film feels extremely rushed and incomplete in the final five minutes.  I would say more, but I would give the film away.  You'll have to see for yourself.  I suggest you get ""Suicide Kings"" if you enjoy other films in a similar genre.

Then the Walken-ator jumps into action and the wheels are in motion.  You watch him size up his captors and turn the situation around to his advantage.  Was there any doubt!

75461,A2UYL2TSVSRFKK,0784011516,Glida,"[4, 8]","Chris Walken, an American cinematic treasure, wrote the book on combining edginess with a quality of understatement suggesting a coiled spring, barely contained, about to explode.  When graced with solid writing, a good  cast, and strong production values, there exists no better genre actor (re  his roles in &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;).Unfortunately, to parody the DVD cover, the concept was perfect, but the  exection was not.  This film suffered from being a derivative, watered  down, pseudo-Tarantino-esque knock off.  The other players were competent,  but not nearly in Walken's class.  The writing especially suffered, falling  into cliche after cliche.  I suspect that the movie might have been  salvagable with a better script, and without the obvious cinematic  stylistic nods to better films (e.g. the opening sequence with Dennis Leary  and his partner engaged in much the same kind of patter....here about  shoes.....in which Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta engaged so  effectively in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;).  The differnce lay in the  charcters and the script - Jackson and Travolta captured our interest - the  Leary character and his partner seemed to be echoing a writer's composite  of what these people should sound like, and every note sounded false.The  best films of this genre all have literate scripts.  The original &quot;The  Big Sleep&quot; was written by William Faulkner.  Tarrantino too is attuned  to the nuances and rhythms of his character's speech.  So see &quot;The Big  Sleep,&quot; &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; &quot;The Maltese Falcon,&quot; and  &quot;The Usual Suspects,&quot; and enjoy!One last point re an earlier  review:  when watching the alternative endings, be sure to use the audio  button on the remote to turn off the commentary if you want to watch the  scene without the director's comments.",2,Derivative....minor genre entry,950313600,"02 12, 2000",2000,1879,"['Chris', 'Walken', 'American', 'cinematic', 'treasure', 'wrote', 'book', 'combining', 'edginess', 'quality', 'understatement', 'suggesting', 'coiled', 'spring', 'barely', 'contained', 'explode', 'When', 'graced', 'solid', 'writing', 'good', 'cast', 'strong', 'production', 'values', 'better', 'genre', 'actor', 're', 'roles', 'quot', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'quot', 'quot', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'quot', '.Unfortunately', 'parody', 'DVD', 'cover', 'concept', 'was', 'perfect', 'exection', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'suffered', 'being', 'derivative', 'watered', 'down', 'pseudo-Tarantino-esque', 'knock', 'other', 'players', 'were', 'competent', 'not', 'nearly', 'Walken', 'class', 'writing', 'especially', 'suffered', 'falling', 'cliche', 'cliche', 'suspect', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'salvagable', 'better', 'script', 'obvious', 'cinematic', 'stylistic', 'nods', 'better', 'films', 'e.g', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Dennis', 'Leary', 'partner', 'engaged', 'much', 'same', 'kind', 'patter', '.here', 'shoes', '..in', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'John', 'Travolta', 'engaged', 'so', 'effectively', 'quot', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'quot', 'differnce', 'lay', 'charcters', 'script', 'Jackson', 'Travolta', 'captured', 'interest', 'Leary', 'character', 'partner', 'seemed', 'be', 'echoing', 'writer', 'composite', 'what', 'people', 'should', 'sound', 'note', 'sounded', 'false.The', 'best', 'films', 'genre', 'have', 'literate', 'scripts', 'original', 'quot', 'Big', 'Sleep', 'quot', 'was', 'written', 'William', 'Faulkner', 'Tarrantino', 'too', 'attuned', 'nuances', 'rhythms', 'character', 'speech', 'So', 'see', 'quot', 'Big', 'Sleep', 'quot', 'quot', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'quot', 'quot', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', 'quot', 'quot', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'quot', 'enjoy', 'One', 'last', 'point', 're', 'earlier', 'review', 'when', 'watching', 'alternative', 'endings', 'be', 'sure', 'use', 'audio', 'button', 'remote', 'turn', 'off', 'commentary', 'want', 'watch', 'scene', 'director', 'comments']",N/A

Apart from that the rest is interesting. The strategy used by the kids is amateurish and silly. The maffia king gets information he should not get but the kids don't know how to monitor communication with such professional outlaws. And then the maffia king plays with them as if they were so many mice and they are mice. Of course the head of the adventure could not be a man. It was too complex in the details and the security of the plot was based on too many layers of distanciated information among the band of apprentice criminals for the brain to be male. So the maffia king manages to talk them into freeing him, though he has to put two million dollars on the table.

But of course the thing that really makes this movie go is Christopher Walken, as effective in this role as any he's ever held.  You could almost believe his role is an older, somewhat more mellow version of the mob caporegime he portrayed in 1993's ""True Romance"", longsince having made it to full boss and retirement to respectability.  The plot revolves around his kidnapping by the aforementioned youthful ensemble cast in an attempt to cash in on a kidnapping/ransom scheme; the fact that Walken spends most of the movie taped to a chair and bleeding profusely, yet still unquestionably maintains the upper hand within his situation and exudes the air of pure menace only lends further testimony to Walken's stature as one of the finest actors of our time, often relegated to the status of cult films icon and undercredited for the sheer magnificence of his ability (it is easy to forget that his performance in the now 25-year old ""The Deer Hunter"" warranted him the Oscar for ""Best Supporting Actor"", after all).The plot resolution is not necessarily new and can be easily enough fleshed out at the first viewing if you're more inclined to spend your time solving the mystery as opposed to just enjoying the actors' performances, but it still detracts in no way from this extremely stylish movie involving a very fluid and fast-paced narrative interspersed with several flashback sequences dating back from a period of several days to twenty-something years.

After telling his buddies, they decide to kidnap a notorious and retired mob boss to get her back. Knowing that he is powerless against them and seeing that he is tied to a chair with one of his fingers cut off, he agrees to use his contacts to get her back. Along the way, he gets into their heads, trying to turn them against each other. What seemed to be a perfect plan quickly gets out of control and leads to horrifying results.

Avery has just found out that his sister has been kidnapped.

They take Walken to Ira's house, and this is where much of the humor in the movie come from, along with the antics of Lono(Denis Leary), who is fabulous as Charlie's driver.THis movie is excellent, mainly due to the superb cast and superb acting.

75485,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,0784011516,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Suicide Kings (Peter O'Fallon, 1997)[originally posted 22Oct2000]Oddly, almost everything I said above about Grosse Pointe Blank can be applied to Suicide Kings, though O'Fallon (probably best known as one of the stable of directors behind Northern Exposure) paid a little more attention to detail, and thus came up with a better film. Six twentysomethings (think a 1997 version of the cast of Boiler Room) are in need of a large amount of cash very quickly, for reasons that aren't clear at the beginning of the film, and they decide the best way to get it is to kidnap a crime figure (Christopher Walken, in perhaps the most normal role I've ever seen from him) and hold him for ransom in an out-of-the-way place. Murphy's Law, of course, goes into play almost immediately, as they pick a crime boss who's no longer involved in the crime business. And things get dumber from there.Sound vaguely familiar? It should. This reminds me in many ways of O'Fallon's homage to Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece, Reservoir Dogs, except that the object of this heist is capable of delivering one-liners and using his crime-boss prowess to work the kidnappers off one another. The kidnappers themselves, almost all of whom have gone on to bigger and better things, have the same kind of fragile repertoire as Tarantino's color-coded jewel thieves, while Walken's character's connections, the Slimy Lawyer (Cliff DeYoung) and the Enforcer (Denis Leary), might as well just be out of thirties pulp detective novels. (In this situation, that's a good thing.) The atmosphere and lighting is sufficiently murky. The only thing that's missing is Jay Mohr reprising Michael Madsen's memorable dance to &#34;Stuck in the Middle with You.&#34;Where O'Fallon breaks the mold, though, and makes this into something more than an homage, is with Johnny Galecki, who plays the son of the owner of the house where the kidnappers are hiding their prey. As an innocent who gets caught up in the espionage a la Patty Hearst, Galecki truly shines in a way he never has before and stamps himself as one of Hollywood's Great Underrated. Even if the rest of the movie were mediocre, Galecki's performance alone would be worth the cost of a video rental. Thankfully, O'Fallon gives you a whole lot more. *** ",4,One eyed jacks are wild.,1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,2274,"['Suicide', 'Kings', 'Peter', ""O'Fallon"", '1997', '[', 'originally', 'posted', '22Oct2000', ']', 'Oddly', 'almost', 'everything', 'said', 'Grosse', 'Pointe', 'Blank', 'can', 'be', 'applied', 'Suicide', 'Kings', ""O'Fallon"", 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'one', 'stable', 'directors', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'paid', 'little', 'more', 'attention', 'detail', 'thus', 'came', 'up', 'better', 'film', 'Six', 'twentysomethings', 'think', '1997', 'version', 'cast', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'are', 'need', 'large', 'amount', 'cash', 'very', 'quickly', 'reasons', 'are', ""n't"", 'clear', 'beginning', 'film', 'decide', 'best', 'way', 'get', 'kidnap', 'crime', 'figure', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'perhaps', 'most', 'normal', 'role', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'hold', 'ransom', 'out-of-the-way', 'place', 'Murphy', 'Law', 'course', 'play', 'almost', 'immediately', 'pick', 'crime', 'boss', 'who', 'longer', 'involved', 'crime', 'business', 'things', 'get', 'dumber', 'there.Sound', 'vaguely', 'familiar', 'should', 'many', 'ways', ""O'Fallon"", 'homage', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'masterpiece', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'object', 'heist', 'capable', 'delivering', 'one-liners', 'using', 'crime-boss', 'prowess', 'work', 'kidnappers', 'off', 'one', 'kidnappers', 'almost', 'whom', 'have', 'gone', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'have', 'same', 'kind', 'fragile', 'repertoire', 'Tarantino', 'color-coded', 'jewel', 'thieves', 'Walken', 'character', 'connections', 'Slimy', 'Lawyer', 'Cliff', 'DeYoung', 'Enforcer', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'be', 'out', 'thirties', 'pulp', 'detective', 'novels', 'situation', 'good', 'thing', 'atmosphere', 'lighting', 'sufficiently', 'murky', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'Jay', 'Mohr', 'reprising', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'memorable', 'dance', '34', 'Stuck', 'Middle', 'You.', '34', 'Where', ""O'Fallon"", 'mold', 'something', 'more', 'homage', 'Johnny', 'Galecki', 'who', 'son', 'owner', 'house', 'where', 'kidnappers', 'are', 'hiding', 'prey', 'innocent', 'who', 'caught', 'up', 'espionage', 'la', 'Patty', 'Hearst', 'Galecki', 'truly', 'way', 'never', 'before', 'stamps', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'Great', 'Underrated', 'Even', 'rest', 'movie', 'were', 'mediocre', 'Galecki', 'performance', 'alone', 'would', 'be', 'cost', 'video', 'rental', 'Thankfully', ""O'Fallon"", 'whole', 'lot', 'more', '***']",N/A

Being a Denis Leary fan, I saw him on the cover and took a second look.  Having enjoyed Jay Mohr on the Jim Rome show and in several of his other movies, I decided it was worth a shot.  I don't regret it.What works?  Christopher Walken, for one, in a role he seems to relish.  Denis Leary as Walken's driver and first officer is a deal-maker; without his performance this is a two star movie at best.  Henry Thomas is mostly believable as the gullible upper-crust boy who will go to extreme lengths to save his sister, though the closeness between the two of them is never really established.  Brad Garrett also turns in an easily-overlooked performance as one of the kidnappers - his timing is as good here as it in is ""Everybody Loves Raymond.""What doesn't work?  The plot, for starters.  Even kids with all the disposable cash in the world would have more trouble pulling off a job like kidnapping Christopher Walken's character.  There are several weak points that are overshadowed by good acting, thankfully.  I needed to see more of the girl, her brother, and her boyfriend before believing what the story told me to believe.  Finally, the ending leaves a bit to be desired, no matter which of the three versions you see (two alternate endings are part of the special feature, with completely banal commentary from the director dubbed over the dialogue).  I would have preferred a much more violent ending myself - too may loose ends left untied for me.All in all, this was an enjoyable movie that I would see again but would likely rent rather than buy.  Tarantino fans should love it, as should anyone who enjoys well-acted mobster movies.  There was a lot of talent in this movie - it's too bad the script and the plot left them underutilized and underappreciated.",3,"Good, very good -- but not great",1015372800,"03 6, 2002",2002,1906,"['SUICIDE', 'KINGS', 'was', ""'let"", 'see', 'movie', 'Friday', 'night', 'house', 'myself', 'commitments', 'other', 'wanted', 'watch', 'Being', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'fan', 'saw', 'cover', 'took', 'second', 'look', 'Having', 'enjoyed', 'Jay', 'Mohr', 'Jim', 'Rome', 'show', 'several', 'other', 'movies', 'decided', 'was', 'worth', 'shot', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'it.What', 'works', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'one', 'role', 'relish', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'Walken', 'driver', 'first', 'officer', 'deal-maker', 'performance', 'two', 'star', 'movie', 'best', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'mostly', 'believable', 'gullible', 'upper-crust', 'boy', 'who', 'will', 'go', 'extreme', 'lengths', 'save', 'sister', 'closeness', 'two', 'never', 'really', 'established', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'also', 'easily-overlooked', 'performance', 'one', 'kidnappers', 'timing', 'as', 'good', 'here', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'What', ""n't"", 'work', 'plot', 'starters', 'Even', 'kids', 'disposable', 'cash', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'trouble', 'pulling', 'off', 'job', 'kidnapping', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'character', 'are', 'several', 'weak', 'points', 'are', 'overshadowed', 'good', 'acting', 'thankfully', 'needed', 'see', 'more', 'girl', 'brother', 'boyfriend', 'believing', 'what', 'story', 'told', 'believe', 'Finally', 'ending', 'bit', 'be', 'desired', 'matter', 'three', 'versions', 'see', 'two', 'alternate', 'endings', 'are', 'part', 'special', 'feature', 'completely', 'banal', 'commentary', 'director', 'dubbed', 'dialogue', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'much', 'more', 'violent', 'ending', 'too', 'may', 'loose', 'ends', 'left', 'untied', 'me.All', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'would', 'see', 'again', 'would', 'likely', 'rent', 'rather', 'buy', 'Tarantino', 'fans', 'should', 'love', 'should', 'anyone', 'who', 'well-acted', 'mobster', 'movies', 'was', 'lot', 'talent', 'movie', 'too', 'bad', 'script', 'plot', 'left', 'underutilized', 'underappreciated']",N/A
