1635691,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B00BMQODF4,blackaciddevil,"[4, 4]","When a meteor knocks a satellite to earth near a small town, both military and local residents are infected with a mysterious germ that turns them into extremely aggressive cannibals. To survive, however, the uninfected must evade the infection & the cannibals and find a way to stop the germ from spreading before it is too late.To be completely honest, I was really skeptical about this film at first. Viewing the trailer, I figured it was going to be real stinker. Yet, when I saw it on the shelf to purchase, I read the description of it & thought that maybe it might not be too bad as it was, in description anyhow, essentially a zombie film. Course, when I viewed the film, I soon realized that they weren't zombies in the classical sense nor the World War Z sense either. That didn't matter, though, because it was too late as I'd already purchased the thing and had it in my DVD player. Giving it a look, I was pleasantly surprised. Germ Z wasn't as bad as I'd thought it would be. It was an interesting film, despite its' low-budget. I was entertained.My only gripes with the film was in its' pacing and the fact that, at times, Germ Z was all over the place plot-wise. If both of those things were tightened up a bit, Germ Z would've been perfect.

I ""grew up"" (actually, I started in my 30s) reading Fangoria and looked forward to each edition.  They always seemed to have the latest skinny on what was happening in the world of horror, and I grew to trust and respect their opinions.  Somewhere along the way, the company decided to start doing its own films...and that's where the problems started.This movie was just plain awful.  The acting (save for the guy that played the Deputy/Coroner) was positively awful.  Very slow paced (no action starts for quite a while), and when the action begins the film becomes increasingly unbelievable.  The script stunk (can you actually imagine being hauled into the sheriff's office because they want an imprint of your teeth--just to make sure it wasn't YOU who ate your boyfriend)??!!!  The love story (and doesn't there ALWAYS have to be a love story...) got on my nerves.  The girl told the guy up front that she did not want anything special out of the relationship, yet all she did was lead the poor guy on.  The makeup and special efforts were sub-standard for a Fangoria film.  The effect with the fireman with an axe in his belly running after the guy was so amateur-night-at-the-Bijou I couldn't believe it.  The axe was first in the belly, but in amazingly moved to the guy's side.  But fear not for all you that thought this was ""intense.""  Looks like they've left it open for a sequel, which I won't be watching.Unrated for some gore and language.

1635694,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B00BMQODF4,Einsatz,"[0, 1]","I love a good zombie movie.  Unfortunately, this isn't one.  I'm not even certain it's supposed to be a zombie movie.  The ""infected"" are described as just cannibals on the DVD case.  Even so, this is a peculiar effort at best.  The camerawork is shoddy.  The acting is primitive.  The production values are basic.  The blood and gore looks as if it was indiscriminately applied by the bucketful, generous but overdone.  Worst of all was the story and the dialog.  Too much time was wasted on disconnected, choppy snippets used to introduce the cast, brief scenes that revealed nothing more than a headcount (a person squeezing oranges, a few seconds of someone in a lake or river, people heading for a forest).  To complicate matters further, the introduction is quickly made null and void with an inscription across the screen: 40 hours earlier..............  The army is moping around a forest, supposedly dodging a fire (in name only), while looking for a...............fill in the blank, too many possibilities are mentioned.  Also in this same forest a few firemen are strolling around, a troop of girl scouts are camping, a guy is chopping firewood.  It takes forever before something finally happens and then when ""it"" does, it's done off screen, shown later as a just body that was chewed on by several people.  When the attacks finally-finally take place on screen, it's a disjointed and furious mess, happening to characters with no dimension, no personality, they're just bodies at this point, spare parts, little more than special effects.  Hardly worth the long wait.Also, the cover art on the DVD bears no resemblance whatsoever to the movie it's supposedly depicts.",3,"""This was no bear.""
