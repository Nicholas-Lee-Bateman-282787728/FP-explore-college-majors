562811,A2HP9COIPKXQ1I,B000050GOW,"B-MAN ""B""","[84, 88]","Contained herein is the complete ""line-up"", the full series of Ben Elton's The Thin Blue Line in another essential DVD set from BBC video!  The first 2 discs include the 14 episodes that make up series 1 & 2 (Nov 1995-Dec 1996) and the 3rd disc includes over an hour of documentary and interview footage of creator/writer Ben Elton.  Elton is best known for his work on Black Adder and the Young Ones.  Both of these are essential DVD sets in your Britcom library and TBL is another must own.The brilliant Rowan Atkinson heads the cast as the ""excessively"" riggid and by the book (which includes his personal life!), Inspector Fowler, who prefers his constables are as he is ""Keen of eye, swift of thought, and regular of bowel"". Rowan's performance here is most similar to his character in the Black Adder as far as dialogue goes so if you like that series you'll more than likely love this.  The Thin Blue Line, like Black Adder, is a dialogue driven show and Ben Elton uses every chance he can to let the characters (especially Fowler and Det. Inspetor Grim) go off into hilariously wordy tangents.  The show is filled with unique characters, each funny in their own right:  Sgt. Patricia Dawkins (Fowler's girlfriend of 10 years!), Constables: Habib, Gladstone, and Goody, Det. Constable Kray (Series 1), Det. Constable Boyle (Series 2), and of course the endlessly bafoonish Det. Inspector Derek Grim of CID.  The show is mostly based in the police station and occasionally in the field or at Fowler & Dawkins' flat.  I fell in love with the show from renting the one lone VHS tape a local video store carried which only contained two episodes.  Those episodes were well played believe me, so seeing this released was quite exciting.  It also completed my Rowan Atkinson DVD trilogy (Black Adder, Mr. Bean, & TBL)! Here's the contents:Disc One: Series 101. Rag Week02. The Queen's Birthday Present03. Night Shift04. Honey Trap05. Fire & Terror06. Kids Today07. Yuletide SpiritDisc Two: Series 208. Court in the act09. Ism Ism Ism10. Fly on the wall11. Alternative Culture12. Come on you blues13. Road Rage14. The Green Eyed MonsterDisc Three: Extras - ""Best of British: Ben Elton"" (45 minute documentary), ""Smillie's People: Ben Elton""(15 minute interview), TBL Cast Bios, & trailersTrivia:*In the first series, Grim's right hand man Kray is played by Kevin Allen.  In series 2 the character is replaced by Boyle (Mark Addy).  You may recognize Addy from ""The Full Monty"" or from the U.S. sitcom ""Still Standing"" where he's married to Jamie Gertz and has a son and daughter.  Addy uses an american accent on the show, but once in a while you can hear his british one come through.*Police Constable Gladstone is played with perfection by Rudolph Walker.  Mr. Bean fans may remember Walker from his small role in the first episode where he is the exam giver.*David Haig (Det. Inspector Grim) also worked with Rowan in the popular British film ""Four Weddings in a Funeral"" where Rowan plays the nervous and fumbling Father Gerald who presides over his wedding.  Haig plays ""Bernard St. John Delaney"".  Priceless scene.I can't complete this review without a few quotes.

Inspector Grim is hilarious with his run-on sentences and overenthusiasm for cases which usually don't end up going his way (like in the Xmas episode when he bags the wrong group of Christmas carolers).Grim's right hand man in the 1st season (the dark haired guy with the unibrow) is much funnier than season two's guy (even though that heavy set guy ended up starring in a US sitcom). He just didn't get the lines and gags that the 1st season gave our unibrow actor.Every character in this show is strongly written and played to a tee. Goodie is also hilarious.Rowan Atkinson makes the show, of course, with his deadpan, afraid of sex and commitment, Chief Inspector role.My only knock is how come it only lasted 2 seasons???

Be fair, this show is from 1995 and was not meant to be a biting societal commentary! If you appreciate scripting that is heavy on clever puns and the ""misunderstanding"" style of humor (for example, walking into a room when the conversation is halfway done and taking what's being said out of context, to HILARIOUS effect), this is just your cup of tea. The wind-ups can be slow, but they're usually just as rewarding when the punchline comes.This was the first Rowan Atkinson-headed show I saw after ""Mr Bean"" and was initially fascinated just to hear his techniques and habits with a spoken role. Some of his uses of facial expressions are cousins or descendents of Mr. Bean's physical comedy, but this show mostly sticks to verbal humor. The entire cast is a generally good mix. Mina Anwar is the sassy but kind Maggie, who has a dozen feisty feminist comebacks at the ready but also has a habit of encouraging others to own up to mistakes and do the right thing. Rudolph Walker's deliciously out-of-touch Gladstone has a variety of exquisitely offbeat anecdotes whose deadpan delivery style will either send you howling or make you roll your eyes, depending on your point of view. James Dreyfus is the boyish, wouldn't-hurt-a-fly (because he's terrified of them) Kevin Goody, and David Haig is the endlessly exasperated Derek Grim (appropriately named, although he offers some of the biggest comic relief on the show). Supporting characters also include the long-suffering Pat Dawkins (courtesy of the charmingly plain Serena Evans) and Grim's goofball sidekicks Kray (Kevin Allen) and Boyle (Mark Addy).Are the plots silly? Yes, but this is a silly show. I think it has an amazing ability to ""whiplash"" the mood around from sharp and serious to cute and cuddly in the span of 10 seconds. It does sometimes touch on real-world issues, but it's usually careful in how and where it treads.I like to mention when a comedy is suitable for children, but for me, a content rating could be tricky to assign for this show. No nudity, big bloody violence, super-dark plots, or severe swearing (though they do say ""arse"" an awful lot), but there's a variety of not-so-subtle innuendo references. It's not as if anyone in the show gets a dildo for a Christmas present, but parents who want to shield their children from all references will need to pre-screen episodes and judge it for themselves. However, smart preteens could easily appreciate much of the humor in this show since a lot of it deals with benign wordplay. I'm accustomed to British English but found this show to be especially easy to follow in terms of jargon used (but you do need to know a bit about Brit pop culture).P.S. - someone was complaining about cuts in episodes.

562830,A1OBJ2263JCK5,B000050GOW,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[7, 7]","Ben Elton's hilarious television series, ""The Thin Blue Line"" features some of the zaniest policeman to ever hit the British small screen. In this 1995-96 Brit-Com, we watch the comedic adventures of the oddball characters, who wear the uniform of the City of Gathforth's Police Department. The series stars the wonderful British TV comedian, Rowan Atkinson as the uptight and prudish Insector, Raymond C. Fowler. He is a man, who is  comically obsessive about following the rules and maintaining stiff upper lip, British decorum. While many might laugh at him and his old fashion values, it is his morality and sense of fairplay that often gets his officers out of the many jams they get into. The other officers include Sgt. Patricia Dawkins (Serena Evans), a middle age and often morose women, who happens to be Fowler's live-in girlfriend. She feels like life is passing her by, which isn't helped by the lack of 'action' in the couple's bedroom. Others include Const. Maggie Habib (Mina Anwar) a smart & pretty young female officer, who's precocious comments often land her in trouble, Const. Frank Gladstone (Rudolph Walker) an older distiguish looking officer, who's long & winding stories of his youth, often come to an almost comically pointless end. Finally, there is the hilarious, Cont. Kevin Goody (James Dreyfus), who's overly effeminate & flamboyant personality, would bring the viewer to the conclusion, that he was gay, if it wasn't for the fact that he is often romantically 'mooning' over Const.Habib. You would think, that city crime would be this zany group's biggest problem. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Instead their attention and problems are often from the same source C.I.D. (Criminal Investigations Division), who often do their detective jobs by cutting corners and bending or even breaking the law. They are lead by the obnoxiously macho, Det. Insp. Derek Grim (David Haig). He's a loud, ranting man, who's seen one too many ""Rambo"" movies and might actually be dangerous, if he had more than half a brain in his head. Unfortunately his ""bull in a china shop"" ways often causes trouble for poor Insp. Fowler and his officers. The comic writing on this show is brillaint. The scripts (from writer/creator Ben Elton) feature a mixture of great characters and sharp dialogue, that will leave you laughing out loud. The ensemble cast is superb. The comic genius of Rowan Atkinson (of ""Mr. Bean"" & ""Black Adder"" fame) once again creates a new wonderful charcter. His bug eyed, Insp. Fowler lovingly pokes fun at every stuffy, prude you have ever come across. Likwise, Serena Evan's Sgt. Dawkins is the comic picture of middle age crisis and sexual desperation. But it is James Dreyfus's rubber faced, Insp. Goody, who really steals every scene he's in. This guy could give legendary comic, Jerry Lewis a real run for his money, when it comes to protraying great slapstick humor! The series has now been released to the DVD format in a three disc box set titled, ""The Thin Blue Line - The Complete Line-Up"". This includes both Series 1 & 2 on the first two discs. The third disc includes a documentary on series co-creator/writer, Ben Elton as well as interviews & trailers. ""The Thin Blue Line"" is a wonderful comedy, which will leave you holding your sides from too much laughter. A great British comedy!

562834,AQR22MPF45M3P,B000050GOW,Rachel Ford,"[4, 4]","I purchased this series because I've enjoyed other works starring Atkinson, and the description sounded funny -- in other words, I had very little idea of what to expect. I was not disappointed. This is something like a modernized, diversified Black Adder-humor cop show. In other words, highly entertaining.There is a fairly sizable cast of characters, most of whom are very good to excellent. The plots are varied, but generally nothing extraordinary (in either a negative or positive sense); the show relies more on the humorous interactions of characters, rather than the storyline of each episode, to foster enjoyment. That said, British humor, obviously, abounds, so, if that bores you, you probably won't like this; otherwise, you will likely enjoy it very much. This is not, imho, the best of British comedy; it is reminiscent of the Black Adder series in its puns, but, alas, the pupil does not outshine the master. One thing, I think, is that Atkinson is not reprising the role at which he most excels -- pseudo-villain. Aktinson's inspector is very good, but he is not the same caliber as the ""Black Vegetable"" -- not through a failing on the actor's part, but by the constraints of the script, which force him (as the part demands) to play a good guy, when he, as an actor, shines so as a villain. That is hardly a problem with either the plot or the acting, though -- just an observation on my part. :)Also to be aware of, depending on the episode, there is a heavy reliance on sexual humor to draw laughs.

He said, ""You watch 'The Thin Blue Line' and cry,"" implying that it's nowhere near as good as BA.  I'm glad to say he was mistaken!""The Thin Blue Line"" is a fine BritCom.  Although nowhere near as sinister as ""Black Adder,"" the writing is still sharp and funny.  There is much more slapstick involved as well, making me feel it has more in common with ""Fawlty Towers,"" perhaps, than BA.There are two big reasons that I enjoy this show so much.  First off, is the obvious choice of Rowan Atkinson.  It's hard to find fault with him in most things, and the the same is true here.  He does such a great job of playing the middle-aged, condescending Inspector Fowler.  The character is best described as the emobodiment of those people who anally correct others' spelling mistakes on internet message boards, and Atkinson plays him well, indeed!  He also comes off blissfully aloof.  When his girlfriend suggests they do something passionate after work, he suggests reading ""King Soloman's Mines!""The second reason to watch this series is, without a doubt, James Dreyfus' performance as the figity, effeminate, Mars bar-loving Constable Goody.  He often gives Rowan a run for his money in several scenes.

While I also like ""Mr. Bean,"" I was pleased but not overwhelmed by ""The Thin Blue Line."" The series does include some great moments, but is essentially a run of the mill ensemble sitcom with a very good cast, which in the extras Ben Elton reveals to be his exact intent. In that regard, because the series excels in what it set out to do, it's a success, it is just lacking some of the cleverness and quirk of ""Blackadder"" and ""Mr. Bean.""Having said that, I do like the series. I marginally prefer the second series, and very much prefer Atkinson's moral lectures as an opening in place of the standard theme song (which is virtually impossible to get out of your mind) from the first season. I find the character of Inspector Raymond Fowler (Atkinson) to be greatly amusing in it's inflexibility. I think David Haig is an excellent supporting actor in his portrayal of the pompous Detective Inspector Grim whose mixed metaphors and euphemisms always get a laugh, while Rudolph Walker playing Police Constable Gladstone is my favorite supporting cast member as he comes up the most surreal comments on a given subject of the entire cast (watch especially for his impersonation of a tree in season two).Overall the plots are fairly predictable and the cast all does great work, but in the end I decided on a four star rating (four and a half might realistically be closer) because even though it is extremely skillfully executed, and is a joy to watch, it really is a very conventional sitcom, which is a departure for the decidedly unconventional Elton and Atkinson.

He always brings the best in comedy to any role he does. When I watch I can be laughing one minute and then I see a deeper & more profound part of his character. Rowan's character of Raymond Fowler is a byzantine one. One minute he is  the straight laced, nose to the grindstone police officer, then the next second he shows a side that can be more compassionate of the people and situations surrounding him. It doesn't help that he is surrounded by a gaggle of quirky and outlandish officers. The quirkiest of the gaggle is Officer Goody. I found Officer Goody's total quirkiness a great contrast to Rowan's straight-laced Officer Fowler. These two have many great scenes together and they work well. Constable Frank Gladstone (I believe played by Rudolph Walker) is a great character as well- very funny. Detective Inspector Derek Grim (David Haig) is hilarious too.This show is a must see for the Rowan Atkinson fan.

Making this series VERY funny.Sadly though, it has languished in obscurity in the mind of the British public since the second series ended in 1996.Atkinson has gone on to do the Bean movie and various other film roles but hasn't yet returned to a leading role on TV.

Unique, potentially satire-rich milieu; strange but engaging characters; talented, comedic performers; semi-believable events; etc.  What we don't have is much in the way of humor.  This two-series program, which initially appeared on BBC TV in the mid 90's, attempts to be based on verbal humor.  Most attempts prove unsuccessful.  The result is mostly silly dialog and actors mugging it up trying to at least look funny.  Such a disaster is totally unexpected, since THE THIN BLUE LINE has the same star and one of the three same credited script writers (another writer was the star) that brought us BLACK ADDER (also from BBC TV) which is arguably the most hilarious TV series ever created.  You might call THE THIN BLUE LINE the MORIBUND GREY ADDER.  Not helping matters is the pervasive use of British slang, and an inane laugh track that often overlaps with repartees.  The sound level of the manufactured laughter is also boosted, perhaps as an act of desperation.  This obnoxious, mechanical contrivance frequently tramples on the rapid, back-and-forth wordplay killing many a riposte.  Video quality is not that great either.  The combination of mostly humorless dialog, a lot of slang, and an industrial-strength laugh machine makes it easy to see why there was never a third series.
