761693,AKJHHD5VEH7VG,B0000A59XX,Dominique,"[22, 22]",I have always loved Richard Simmons. This workout requires two sets of weights but I was fine using the same set for both segments that used the hand weights.  This is a great upper body workout. The bottom is targeted as well but with less intensity.  The final segment of the DVD is a mat abs workout. This workout was tougher than most that I've seen. I know my abs will transform with this.  Not sure about it if you have a neck problem. You can probably improvise. Maybe it was just my form that made my neck sore.The warmup starts with the opening credits. It caught me off guard and I had a bit of a hard time following it but that was just after viewing the DVD once. I don't see this being a problem in the future.This is a strong 30 minute routine that does hit every body part.,4,Killer ab section on this workout!,1171670400,"02 17, 2007",2007,788,"['have', 'always', 'loved', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'workout', 'two', 'sets', 'weights', 'was', 'fine', 'using', 'same', 'set', 'segments', 'used', 'hand', 'weights', 'great', 'upper', 'body', 'workout', 'bottom', 'targeted', 'as', 'well', 'less', 'intensity', 'final', 'segment', 'DVD', 'mat', 'abs', 'workout', 'workout', 'was', 'tougher', 'most', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'know', 'abs', 'will', 'transform', 'Not', 'sure', 'have', 'neck', 'problem', 'can', 'probably', 'improvise', 'Maybe', 'was', 'just', 'form', 'made', 'neck', 'sore.The', 'warmup', 'opening', 'credits', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'had', 'bit', 'hard', 'time', 'following', 'was', 'just', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'once', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'being', 'problem', 'future.This', 'strong', '30', 'minute', 'routine', 'hit', 'body', 'part']",Richard Simmons: Blast & Tone

You use two sets of weights in this routine - a lighter set for endurance and a heavier one for strength, then there's an Ab floor routine and cool down.I started out liking the routine, but the more I do it, the better I like it.  This is one of his more recent tapes and features a more muscular Richard.  As usual, he has an assortment of shapes, sizes and ages of people doing the routine with him and they all look so happy and seem to be having a lot of fun - and you find you do too.The music is great and between the motivational things Richard says and the words in the songs, you really feel good when you get done.  I've seen some definite improvement in tone and attribute it all to this tape and Sweat and Tone that uses toning bands.Richard Simmon's queuing on this tape is very good.

I was hoping to get a great Richard Simmons type workout, while focusing on these all important areas. The workout, however, is ok. I find that it is not very long, so I barely break a sweat.  Also, I don't particularly like the music. I was hoping to find something more along the lines of his other exercise videos where the music is fun to sing and dance to. It doesn't even have the fun and excitement of the other videos because there are not so many people working out along with him. However, because I don't have a lot time to spend working out, Richard's video works well.  You can pop it in early in the morning before you start your day. But if you are serious about strength training and floor work, I would find something else.

761700,A36E7G8BP8JYFX,B0000A59XX,Yvette R. Williams,"[1, 2]","I am an Intermediate Exerciser who likes to have a nice selection of Beginner DVD's for for my early morning easy breezy workouts. I workout two to three times per day and I prefer my early morning workout to be just a little something to burn a few calories and get my metabolism going. So this morning I got up and walked my dog as usual in my neighborhood and after we got back I did this video...MON/WEDS/FRI are my Resistance Training Days. This video was easy to follow, the time FLEW by, it felt more like 15 minutes instead of 30, and Richard is very cheerful so there was no dread factor. I wore my heart rate monitor and it told me that I burned 131 calories. So, that coupled with my walk allowed me to burn a total of 240 calories. Later in my day I will burn another 500-600 calories or so by doing some vigorous cardio and in the evening doing a much more intense Resistance DVD, maybe a Kelly Coffey DVD. Overall this is a good video for someone who is a Beginner and wants to start strengthening their bones, do some toning and burn calories more efficiently. The ab section actually burned my abs a bit and may be a little tough for a beginner BUT if you stick to it and just do what you can, resting when you need to, you will build up to being able to do it all. I didn't break a sweat, only a bit of moisture on my face but again I am a strong Intermediate Exerciser. I have about 200 fitness DVD's and this one will go on the Beginner Shelf for morning workouts...I enjoyed it a lot!",4,"Beginner, Fun, Quick...",1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,1504,"['am', 'Intermediate', 'Exerciser', 'who', 'likes', 'have', 'nice', 'selection', 'Beginner', 'DVD', 'early', 'morning', 'easy', 'breezy', 'workouts', 'workout', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'day', 'prefer', 'early', 'morning', 'workout', 'be', 'just', 'little', 'something', 'burn', 'few', 'calories', 'get', 'metabolism', 'going', 'So', 'morning', 'got', 'up', 'walked', 'dog', 'usual', 'neighborhood', 'got', 'back', 'did', 'video', 'MON/WEDS/FRI', 'are', 'Resistance', 'Training', 'Days', 'video', 'was', 'easy', 'follow', 'time', 'FLEW', 'felt', 'more', '15', 'minutes', 'instead', '30', 'Richard', 'very', 'cheerful', 'was', 'dread', 'factor', 'wore', 'heart', 'rate', 'monitor', 'told', 'burned', '131', 'calories', 'So', 'coupled', 'walk', 'allowed', 'burn', 'total', '240', 'calories', 'Later', 'day', 'will', 'burn', '500-600', 'calories', 'so', 'doing', 'vigorous', 'cardio', 'evening', 'doing', 'much', 'more', 'intense', 'Resistance', 'DVD', 'maybe', 'Kelly', 'Coffey', 'DVD', 'Overall', 'good', 'video', 'someone', 'who', 'Beginner', 'start', 'strengthening', 'bones', 'do', 'toning', 'burn', 'calories', 'more', 'efficiently', 'ab', 'section', 'actually', 'burned', 'abs', 'bit', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'tough', 'beginner', 'BUT', 'stick', 'just', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'resting', 'when', 'need', 'will', 'build', 'up', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'did', ""n't"", 'break', 'sweat', 'only', 'bit', 'moisture', 'face', 'again', 'am', 'strong', 'Intermediate', 'Exerciser', 'have', '200', 'fitness', 'DVD', 'one', 'will', 'go', 'Beginner', 'Shelf', 'morning', 'workouts', 'enjoyed', 'lot']",Richard Simmons: Blast & Tone
