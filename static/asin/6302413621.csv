In pursuit of the culprit he may get mixed up in something so big that we may cringe. Looks like there is a cabal protecting a formula; But where does Barney come in and will he come out alive?This may have been unique in 1982 but it has been over played lately. Still this makes for a great entertaining who-dun-it movie. Yes it had George C. Scott and Marlon Brando at their best. However it was held together by the rest of the cast.A side note is that I only had two years of German and they never once used anything past that. It was so simple that they probably did not need the subtitles.The DVD I watched has a voice over commentary by Steve Shagan.See another unique mystery with George C.

Plot-heavy, you could always go back and re-read the bits you hadn't taken in from the start. As a film, however, it lacks drama, and I think it must be because the writer was just not fully aware how visual entertainment works, either on the screen or on the stage. There is a lack of emotional engagement from and between every single character: each one merely seems to be reading his lines from the book. These are good actors, so it's not so obvious, but the whole thing is like a jigsaw puzzle none of whose pieces quite fit. Moreover, the actors all seem to know this: I suppose it's the director's fault, as well as the writer's. None of these thespians seem at home. G.C.Scott is dead serious, but he convinces neither as a father nor as a lover: these are not roles he's comfortable with. Gielgud's appearance, and performance, is startlingly out-of-place. Brando looks as if he's on a frolic of his own, in an ill-fitting suit, pug nose, lip-padding, and the kind of haircut that always worries you whenever you see one. No. It's kind of interesting, but I couldn't call it good.

These are the very first lever of the world, but petroleum can't be manufactured: as gold, it's a product of a limited amount, but, What if you truly could find a formula that permits you to make artificial gasoline? It had to be fabulous and terrible for the petrol corporations and for all. I have to say I know very little about petroleum sciences but certainly Germans attained to make it from charcoal. The problem with all this questions is if you have to waste more energy for producing it than these you obtain.

311132,A2T049UQONS0OY,6302413621,Larry VanDeSande,"[7, 7]","This film had a lot going for it -- an interesting and timely story about Nazis, world fuel supplies, and high gas prices; a bunch of great actors including Marlon Brando and George C. Scott in his last performance; and solid production values.Unfortuately, this was all undone because ""The Formula"" -- a formula for alternative fuel devised by the Nazis in World War II and hidden by gas executives -- is the most poorly edited film in movie history. The chain of events in this movie is so incongruous is strains the viewer to stay involved and eventually defeats every viewer's ability to manage the ""plot"".I'll never forget the day I waited in anticipation of seeing it at the theater when it came out in 1980. While standing in line to enter, my frined from work came out. I asked him how it was. ""You have to keep up with it,"" he said.Not much question today that he wasn't being cryptic or evasive in his response. This film had everything going for it -- great actors, a timely plot, perhaps even more timely today, great studio values, wonderful lighting, everything except an editor.Finally, I have two questions: Why wasn't this film re-edited on DVD release?

311133,A34LM956QBECQ6,6302413621,Paul A. Mcdowell,"[5, 14]","On the surface this film is about a discovery of a method that can produce cheap gas, and ""Big Oil's"" attempt to supress that discovery for decades in the name of profits. The Nazi scientists make the discovery and in an attempt for immunity from prosecution they try to trade the secret to the Allies. Instead, an officer deals the information privately and the oil industry spend the next 40 years hiding the secret and [sipping] up the oil profits.The movie focuses on George C. Scott as the LAPD investigator who is placed on a murder case. Through cryptic clues and some convenient insight the trail leads to Germany (via Italy) and the Los Angeles officer jumps on a plane. Once there he learns of the secret as he finds more people connected in the international conspiracy. The more he learns the closer the danger comes to Scott himself.The tension of movie relies on the confrontations between Scott and the myriad of talented actors he interviews. If these were better built they could make for a fun movie despite the plot. Unfortunately, almost all the characters lack any conviction. I don't believe that Scott's character cares at all about the oil or murders. He just wants to win and be done with it. The other characters are worse. Most of the characters are murdered just as soon as the plot no longer needs them ... sometimes seconds after Scott is finished interviewing them. Most of them seem to be working for the best accent/foreign language oscar. There are some thick german accents that arent understandable and sections of germen dialog that arent subtitled. Surprisingly, even Sir John Gielgud snarls his way through his dialog. Brando is as usual in his own world. His accent, I can only guess, is supposted to be Southern/Texan? but with his normal lisp doesnt come out too well.In the end there is nothing special or outstanding about this movie besides the plot, which is unique but suffers from obvious plot devices to manipulate without bothering to construct real characters. Almost as believable as your typical Bond film. There is nothing in this movie you cant find somewhere else (although maybe not altogether) so if these actors are favorites I suggest nearly any other movie. At a minimum rent first.
