I wanted to see the music performances of a genius known as Jim Morrison.  I certainly did not want to waste my time listening to interviews of the other band members.  The way that the DVD is set up, I was forced to sit through them, anyway.  Even from the ""pick a song"" portion of the menu, I could not go directly to a song that I wanted to hear.  After a while, I just gave up, because I grew weary of listening to the boring interviews in order to hear the music that I love.",1,A frustrating experience for a fan of their music,1221264000,"09 13, 2008",2008,554,"['DVD', 'frustrating', 'say', 'least', 'menus', 'are', 'messed', 'up', 'wanted', 'see', 'music', 'performances', 'genius', 'known', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'waste', 'time', 'listening', 'interviews', 'other', 'band', 'members', 'way', 'DVD', 'set', 'up', 'was', 'forced', 'sit', 'anyway', 'Even', 'pick', 'song', 'portion', 'menu', 'could', 'not', 'go', 'directly', 'song', 'wanted', 'hear', 'while', 'just', 'gave', 'up', 'grew', 'weary', 'listening', 'boring', 'interviews', 'order', 'hear', 'music', 'love']",N/A

Along the way you get insightful dialogue from surviving Doors' members(Krieger/Densmore/Manzarek) along with former manager Danny Sugerman. Their discussion include topics such as Morrison, The Miami Incident, meanings of certain famous Doors' songs, etc.The first featured performance in Toronto showcased a young Doors' group that was beginning to form its national identity. I found interesting their choice of attire compared to their latter incarnations; definately a lot more casual later on.The Denmark performance is in black & white and showcases a Doors' band at the peak of their fame. They perform some of their most well known songs and Jim's got that classic ""rock-star"" look with his leather pants and all.For the New York PBS performance, Jim is fully in his bearded, older look along with a more subdued persona. The band is also interviewed on stage by a ""hippie"" looking host who seems to admire their music.I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD from beginning to end. This is my first time watching these performances, which I found to be both entertaining and inspiring. For me, I especially love the band's PBS performance.

719892,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B00006L929,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[3, 3]","When I first heard that The Doors Soundstage Performances was coming out in 02 I was really excited. At the time I hadn't seen a lot of footage of The Doors so it I eagerly awaited and anticipated it and when it came out I wasn't disappointed and I don't think you will be either.The Soundstage Performances are kind of a mini retrospective of The Doors from the beginning of their performing career to towards the end. It has three different venues from 1967 right before Light My Fire became a number one record and up until the 69 Critique show on PBS. Each section is preceded with an introduction by Danny Sugerman and a few pithy remarks by the surviving Doors Ray Manzarek, John Densmore, and Robby Krieger.Toronto May, 1967-This is a one song performance that was on Canadian National Television and they did The End! This is the early Doors at their burning best. There's an audience but you can tell they don't know what to expect from The Doors. Jim Morrison quivers like he's receiving raw voltage and the performance pulsates with the energy Morrison channels. You can feel the raw power of this performance and see why The Doors were about to make it big, and are still a legendary band.Danish TV Show 1968- This is the whole half hour uncut, no commercial interrupted television show. It's more sedate than the Toronto footage and Morrison is visibly stoned and sits on a bar stool through the first couple of songs. But it's a more intimate look at The Doors, everything is up close, and the camera lingers on each member of the band.  And Morrison is more aware of the camera, he's learned to play to it. He knows when to look right into the camera and when to back off. There is one funny moment where he loses the camera, he realizes the camera he's playing to isn't on and he turns suddenly to the right camera.The PBS Critique Show, NY, 1969- The Doors played on this show in the aftermath of the Miami incident and this was the only place they could play live. The original show contained an interview with rock critic Richard Goldstein. A set of five songs The Doors performed live, and a panel discussion.The performance on this show is another good intimate look at The Doors performing. You can see the interplay of Morrison with the rest of the band, and the Soft Parade, maybe one of the few times they performed it live is quite compelling and Morrison makes it a tour-de-force.There are a couple things wrong with this section of the DVD. The biggest problem is the quality of the video transfer. There are glitches and dropouts, but by far the biggest shortcoming is, during The Doors performance it seems like the original video dragged as it was being transferred and the sound and picture lose speed, it happens a couple of times and brings down the enjoyment of watching. If it weren't for that technical problem I would have given this review 5 stars.And then there's the panel discussion or rather the lack of it. While the interview with Goldstein has been widely released the panel discussion, so far, hasn't seen the light of day. I was at Doorsfest 02 where Danny Sugerman appeared and he asked the people there if the panel discussion should be included and the resounding answer was ""yes!""  But for whatever reason it isn't in there.I don't know if this qualifies as a bonus features section but after it looks like the DVD is officially over, there are more interviews with Ray, Robby and John as they discuss a little something about each of the songs performed on the DVD.For most fans I would say this is an essential addition to your collection, and you'll find yourself watching the performances again and again.",4,Exciting Addition for Your Doors Collection!,1247011200,"07 8, 2009",2009,3661,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'Doors', 'Soundstage', 'Performances', 'was', 'coming', 'out', '02', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'time', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'lot', 'footage', 'Doors', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'anticipated', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be', 'either.The', 'Soundstage', 'Performances', 'are', 'kind', 'mini', 'retrospective', 'Doors', 'beginning', 'performing', 'career', 'towards', 'end', 'three', 'different', 'venues', '1967', 'right', 'before', 'Light', 'My', 'Fire', 'became', 'number', 'one', 'record', 'up', '69', 'Critique', 'show', 'PBS', 'section', 'preceded', 'introduction', 'Danny', 'Sugerman', 'few', 'pithy', 'remarks', 'surviving', 'Doors', 'Ray', 'Manzarek', 'John', 'Densmore', 'Robby', 'Krieger.Toronto', 'May', '1967-This', 'one', 'song', 'performance', 'was', 'Canadian', 'National', 'Television', 'did', 'End', 'early', 'Doors', 'burning', 'best', 'audience', 'can', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Doors', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'quivers', 'receiving', 'raw', 'voltage', 'performance', 'energy', 'Morrison', 'channels', 'can', 'feel', 'raw', 'power', 'performance', 'see', 'why', 'Doors', 'were', 'about', 'make', 'big', 'are', 'still', 'legendary', 'band.Danish', 'TV', 'Show', '1968-', 'whole', 'half', 'hour', 'uncut', 'commercial', 'interrupted', 'television', 'show', 'more', 'sedate', 'Toronto', 'footage', 'Morrison', 'visibly', 'stoned', 'sits', 'bar', 'stool', 'first', 'couple', 'songs', 'more', 'intimate', 'look', 'Doors', 'everything', 'up', 'close', 'camera', 'member', 'band', 'Morrison', 'more', 'aware', 'camera', 'learned', 'play', 'when', 'look', 'right', 'camera', 'when', 'back', 'off', 'one', 'funny', 'moment', 'where', 'camera', 'camera', 'playing', ""n't"", 'suddenly', 'right', 'camera.The', 'PBS', 'Critique', 'Show', 'NY', '1969-', 'Doors', 'played', 'show', 'aftermath', 'Miami', 'incident', 'was', 'only', 'place', 'could', 'play', 'live', 'original', 'show', 'contained', 'interview', 'rock', 'critic', 'Richard', 'Goldstein', 'A', 'set', 'five', 'songs', 'Doors', 'performed', 'live', 'panel', 'discussion.The', 'performance', 'show', 'good', 'intimate', 'look', 'Doors', 'performing', 'can', 'see', 'interplay', 'Morrison', 'rest', 'band', 'Soft', 'Parade', 'maybe', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'performed', 'live', 'quite', 'compelling', 'Morrison', 'tour-de-force.There', 'are', 'couple', 'things', 'wrong', 'section', 'DVD', 'biggest', 'problem', 'quality', 'video', 'transfer', 'are', 'glitches', 'dropouts', 'far', 'biggest', 'shortcoming', 'Doors', 'performance', 'original', 'video', 'dragged', 'was', 'being', 'transferred', 'sound', 'picture', 'lose', 'speed', 'couple', 'times', 'down', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'were', ""n't"", 'technical', 'problem', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'review', '5', 'stars.And', 'then', 'panel', 'discussion', 'rather', 'lack', 'interview', 'Goldstein', 'been', 'widely', 'released', 'panel', 'discussion', 'so', 'far', ""n't"", 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'was', 'Doorsfest', '02', 'where', 'Danny', 'Sugerman', 'appeared', 'asked', 'people', 'there', 'panel', 'discussion', 'should', 'be', 'included', 'resounding', 'answer', 'was', 'yes', 'reason', ""n't"", 'there.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'bonus', 'section', 'DVD', 'officially', 'over', 'are', 'more', 'interviews', 'Ray', 'Robby', 'John', 'discuss', 'little', 'something', 'songs', 'performed', 'DVD.For', 'most', 'fans', 'would', 'say', 'essential', 'addition', 'collection', ""'ll"", 'find', 'watching', 'performances', 'again', 'again']",N/A

719896,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,B00006L929,Robert Blake,"[64, 66]","Leave it to The Doors to release a new DVD with performances you can ALREADY get on the &quot;Doors Collection&quot; and &quot;Live In Europe&quot; DVDs but they make it tempting because there are a few &quot;new&quot; added songs and interviews with the band members and manager Danny Sugerman. This is still a pretty interesting document on how much of a great live band The Doors actually were. More influential than even the music is The Doors', and especially Jim Morrison's, stage presence. Morrison introduced theater into rock music, he brought the classic drama of the Greeks and writings of William Blake and Nietzsche to the rock stage. We need look no further than to their stunning performance of &quot;The End&quot; in this set to see that Morrison was the first rock performer to bring the elements of shamanistic ritual to the genre long before the likes of Godsmack's Sully Erna or Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. Fans should especially get this new collection for &quot;The End,&quot; it is a great, rare performance recorded for a television program before &quot;Light My Fire&quot; had even hit #1 and attained the band legendary status. Here we also find an example of how Morrison, clad in black leather, introduced darkness into the mainstream during the Summer Of Love (though the Velvet Underground is credited sometimes for bringing the darker corners of rock, it is The Doors who perfected it and made it influential and widespread). Here Morrison appears as the poet, he croons, screams and collapses. &quot;When The Music's Over&quot; is another moment of great effect, here the band comes alive with another of their long poetic invocations where Morrison chants &quot;we want the world and we want it now.&quot; Ray Manzarek masterfully creates mood with his organ while Robby Krieger adds his guitar licks as energetic brushstrokes and drummer John Densmore accents it all with his expressionistic, highly influential work. Morrison again croons, invokes and chants like a shaman turned rock star come to liberate us from repetitive, popular music constraints. The most lacking segment is that of the PBS special the band did shortly after the infamous 1969 Miami concert where Morrison supposedly exposed himself. First, there is the bad video quality, it looks more blurry and shakey than in the original versions found in the &quot;Doors Collection&quot; DVD, where the images appeared crisp and clear. Second, well, let's be honest, &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; remains The Doors' weakest album and it shows here, if &quot;The End&quot; and &quot;When The Music's Over&quot; grab us, then &quot;Tell All The People&quot; and &quot;Wishful, Sinful&quot; play more like easy, digestable candy for the ears. The only noteworthy part is when the band breaks into their classic live medley of &quot;Alabama Song&quot; and &quot;Backdoor Man&quot; where they masterfully perform the selection from the classic German opera and a midnight blues crawler by Willie Dixon. &quot;The Soundstage Performances&quot; therefore is a nice addition to a Doors'fan collection, that is, the Doors fan who is willing to buy a new tape or DVD with performances he/she may already own for the sake of a few new additions such as the insightful interviews with the band members and manager found before the performances. Still, this is a good set that displays the live power of the greatest American rock band of all time.",4,Great Live Performances.,1058572800,"07 19, 2003",2003,3429,"['Leave', 'Doors', 'release', 'new', 'DVD', 'performances', 'can', 'ALREADY', 'get', 'quot', 'Doors', 'Collection', 'quot', 'quot', 'Live', 'Europe', 'quot', 'DVDs', 'make', 'tempting', 'are', 'few', 'quot', 'new', 'quot', 'added', 'songs', 'interviews', 'band', 'members', 'manager', 'Danny', 'Sugerman', 'still', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'document', 'how', 'much', 'great', 'live', 'band', 'Doors', 'actually', 'were', 'More', 'influential', 'even', 'music', 'Doors', 'especially', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'stage', 'presence', 'Morrison', 'introduced', 'theater', 'rock', 'music', 'brought', 'classic', 'drama', 'Greeks', 'writings', 'William', 'Blake', 'Nietzsche', 'rock', 'stage', 'need', 'look', 'further', 'stunning', 'performance', 'quot', 'End', 'quot', 'set', 'see', 'Morrison', 'was', 'first', 'rock', 'performer', 'bring', 'elements', 'shamanistic', 'ritual', 'genre', 'long', 'likes', 'Godsmack', 'Sully', 'Erna', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'Eddie', 'Vedder', 'Fans', 'should', 'especially', 'get', 'new', 'collection', 'quot', 'End', 'quot', 'great', 'rare', 'performance', 'recorded', 'television', 'program', 'quot', 'Light', 'My', 'Fire', 'quot', 'had', 'even', 'hit', '1', 'attained', 'band', 'legendary', 'status', 'Here', 'also', 'find', 'example', 'how', 'Morrison', 'clad', 'black', 'leather', 'introduced', 'darkness', 'mainstream', 'Summer', 'Love', 'Velvet', 'Underground', 'credited', 'sometimes', 'bringing', 'darker', 'corners', 'rock', 'Doors', 'who', 'perfected', 'made', 'influential', 'widespread', 'Here', 'Morrison', 'poet', 'screams', 'collapses', 'quot', 'When', 'Music', 'Over', 'quot', 'moment', 'great', 'effect', 'here', 'band', 'alive', 'long', 'poetic', 'invocations', 'where', 'Morrison', 'quot', 'want', 'world', 'want', 'now.', 'quot', 'Ray', 'Manzarek', 'masterfully', 'mood', 'organ', 'Robby', 'Krieger', 'guitar', 'licks', 'energetic', 'brushstrokes', 'drummer', 'John', 'Densmore', 'accents', 'expressionistic', 'highly', 'influential', 'work', 'Morrison', 'again', 'croons', 'invokes', 'chants', 'shaman', 'turned', 'rock', 'star', 'come', 'liberate', 'repetitive', 'popular', 'music', 'constraints', 'most', 'lacking', 'segment', 'PBS', 'special', 'band', 'did', 'shortly', 'infamous', '1969', 'Miami', 'concert', 'where', 'Morrison', 'supposedly', 'exposed', 'First', 'bad', 'video', 'quality', 'more', 'blurry', 'shakey', 'original', 'versions', 'found', 'quot', 'Doors', 'Collection', 'quot', 'DVD', 'where', 'images', 'appeared', 'crisp', 'clear', 'Second', 'well', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'quot', 'Soft', 'Parade', 'quot', 'Doors', 'weakest', 'album', 'here', 'quot', 'End', 'quot', 'quot', 'When', 'Music', 'Over', 'quot', 'grab', 'then', 'quot', 'Tell', 'People', 'quot', 'quot', 'Wishful', 'Sinful', 'quot', 'play', 'more', 'easy', 'digestable', 'candy', 'ears', 'only', 'noteworthy', 'part', 'when', 'band', 'breaks', 'classic', 'live', 'medley', 'quot', 'Alabama', 'Song', 'quot', 'quot', 'Backdoor', 'Man', 'quot', 'where', 'masterfully', 'perform', 'selection', 'classic', 'German', 'opera', 'midnight', 'blues', 'crawler', 'Willie', 'Dixon', 'quot', 'Soundstage', 'Performances', 'quot', 'therefore', 'nice', 'addition', ""Doors'fan"", 'collection', 'Doors', 'fan', 'who', 'willing', 'buy', 'new', 'tape', 'DVD', 'performances', 'he/she', 'may', 'already', 'own', 'sake', 'few', 'new', 'additions', 'such', 'insightful', 'interviews', 'band', 'members', 'manager', 'found', 'performances', 'Still', 'good', 'set', 'live', 'power', 'greatest', 'American', 'rock', 'band', 'time']",N/A
