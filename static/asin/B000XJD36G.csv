Get this dvd set and share history--and knowledge of a great journalist--with your children. Let them see what broadcast radio and television was like before the days of Beck and Limbaugh and Hannity and O'Reilly.They will thank you.",5,A Wonderful Walk Through History With One of the Great Journalists of Our Time,1253232000,"09 18, 2009",2009,827,"['tin', 'box-packaging', 'fitting', 'unusual', 'memento', '20th', 'century', 'made', 'more', 'poignant', 'recent', 'passing', 'wonderful', 'host', 'Walter', 'Cronkite.If', 'are', 'history', 'buff', 'will', 'love', 'Cronkite', 'retrospective', 'events', 'century', 'lived', 'reported', 'complete', 'own', 'personal', 'reflections', 'memories', 'historic', 'events', 'World', 'War', 'landing', 'moon', 'reminder', 'what', 'world', 'used', 'be', 'what', 'good', 'broadcast', 'journalism', 'used', 'be.We', 'may', 'not', 'miss', 'past', 'are', 'less', 'loss', 'Cronkite', 'Get', 'dvd', 'set', 'share', 'history', 'knowledge', 'great', 'journalist', 'children', 'Let', 'see', 'what', 'broadcast', 'radio', 'television', 'was', 'days', 'Beck', 'Limbaugh', 'Hannity', ""O'Reilly.They"", 'will', 'thank']",N/A

His name is a Brand for quality and seriousness.I, we, all miss him and other colleagues like him, who helped make Television a respectable and believable stage for serious News.Bring back those days and turn them into a new age of Television making...",5,Just the name is Legend...,1254096000,"09 28, 2009",2009,1773,"['am', 'not', 'American', 'have', 'directly', 'lived', 'times', 'places', 'Walter', 'Cronkite', 'Man', 'face', 'were', 'unique', 'world.A', 'Gentleman', 'amongst', 'journalists', 'crooner', 'one', 'rare', 'examples', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'homework', 'sitting', 'standing', 'front', 'camera.A', 'man', 'who', 'risked', 'life', 'going', 'Hell', 'War', 'man', 'who', 'knew', 'people', 'was', 'talking', 'about', 'man', 'who', 'went', 'deeper', 'facts', 'orderto', 'report', 'events', 'times.One', 'can', 'tell', 'glance', 'why', 'man', 'became', 'true', 'icon', 'not', 'just', 'American', 'international', 'television', 'making.It', 'so', 'rewarding', 'see', 'someone', 'still', 'people', 'Walter', 'Cronkite', 'especially', 'day', 'age', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'remember', 'who', 'Neil', 'Armstrong', 'was.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'set', 'yet', 'being', 'Walter', 'Cronkite', 'can', 'only', 'mean', 'true', 'lived', 'history', 'told', 'man', 'who', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'talking', 'about.He', 'left', 'mark', 'trade.Alas', 'younger', 'generations', 'journalists', 'have', 'decided', 'not', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'preferring', 'just', 'glamorous', 'sides', 'News', 'easier', 'side', 'trade', 'not', 'speak', 'monetary', 'compensations', 'come', 'kind', 'television', 'products.I', 'can', 'only', 'wish', 'future', 'will', 'see', 'younger', 'generation', 'crooners', 'following', 'footsteps', 'great', 'man.Working', 'hard', 'researching', 'accuracy', 'being', 'specific', 'what', 'report.If', 'wishes', 'were', 'horses', 'can', 'recommend', 'anything', 'involving', 'Walter', 'Cronkite', 'name', 'Brand', 'quality', 'seriousness.I', 'miss', 'other', 'colleagues', 'who', 'helped', 'make', 'Television', 'respectable', 'believable', 'stage', 'serious', 'News.Bring', 'back', 'days', 'turn', 'new', 'age', 'Television', 'making']",N/A
