931302,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B000AQKV1C,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[47, 47]","On August 15th, 1998, 3 months after the Good Friday Peace Settlement, a 500 lb. car bomb exploded in the town of Omagh, killing 29 people (one who was expecting twins), and injuring 160. It was the ""the most grave and exceptional crime in the history of Northern Ireland,"" and rumors of government conspiracy and cover-up continue to this day. ""Omagh"" starts in the early morning hours of the 15th, with the terrorists preparing the bomb, the deadly, horrific scene of the explosion, which was made worse by the misinformed police directing the people towards the bomb instead of away from it. It continues with the inexpressible grief of the families seeking their loved ones in the aftermath. The central focus of the film is the story of Michael Gallagher, who lost his 21 year-old son Aiden in the blast, and to this day seeks justice that is hard to come by, as many government officials from both sides have seemingly stalled the process. Gallagher was told that the Peace Process was more important, and we see his frustration dealing with the authorities as the spokesman for the bereaved families.Directed by Pete Travis, this is a wrenching film with marvelous performances, notably by Gerard McSorley as Gallagher, and Michelle Forbes as his wife Patsy. Brenda Fricker has a small but pivotal role as Police Ombudsman Nuala O'Loan, who uncovered much of the details behind the government inaction. ""Omagh"" is a riveting but sometimes flawed film, and should be seen for its historical value for those interested in the many years of Troubles in Ireland, and the timely topic of terrorism worldwide. I needed to use the subtitle option, not because of the Irish accents, but because the audio is unbalanced, and at times inaudible. Another quibble is the print used for the titles, credits, and most importantly the aftermath update, is so small it is illegible on my 27"" screen. Information on this incident is widely available on the internet however, and one can read that justice has been slow and meager. Total running time is 106 minutes.",4,"""You're in the way of the Peace Process, Michael""",1129766400,"10 20, 2005",2005,2055,"['August', '15th', '1998', '3', 'months', 'Good', 'Friday', 'Peace', 'Settlement', '500', 'lb', 'car', 'bomb', 'exploded', 'town', 'Omagh', 'killing', '29', 'people', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'expecting', 'twins', 'injuring', '160', 'was', 'most', 'grave', 'exceptional', 'crime', 'history', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'rumors', 'government', 'conspiracy', 'cover-up', 'continue', 'day', 'Omagh', 'early', 'morning', 'hours', '15th', 'terrorists', 'preparing', 'bomb', 'deadly', 'horrific', 'scene', 'explosion', 'was', 'made', 'worse', 'misinformed', 'police', 'directing', 'people', 'towards', 'bomb', 'instead', 'away', 'inexpressible', 'grief', 'families', 'seeking', 'loved', 'ones', 'aftermath', 'central', 'focus', 'film', 'story', 'Michael', 'Gallagher', 'who', 'lost', '21', 'year-old', 'son', 'Aiden', 'blast', 'day', 'justice', 'hard', 'come', 'many', 'government', 'officials', 'sides', 'have', 'seemingly', 'stalled', 'process', 'Gallagher', 'was', 'told', 'Peace', 'Process', 'was', 'more', 'important', 'see', 'frustration', 'dealing', 'authorities', 'spokesman', 'bereaved', 'families.Directed', 'Pete', 'Travis', 'wrenching', 'film', 'marvelous', 'performances', 'notably', 'Gerard', 'McSorley', 'Gallagher', 'Michelle', 'Forbes', 'wife', 'Patsy', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'small', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Police', 'Ombudsman', 'Nuala', ""O'Loan"", 'who', 'uncovered', 'much', 'details', 'government', 'inaction', 'Omagh', 'riveting', 'sometimes', 'flawed', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'historical', 'value', 'interested', 'many', 'years', 'Troubles', 'Ireland', 'timely', 'topic', 'terrorism', 'worldwide', 'needed', 'use', 'subtitle', 'option', 'not', 'Irish', 'accents', 'audio', 'unbalanced', 'times', 'inaudible', 'quibble', 'print', 'used', 'titles', 'credits', 'most', 'importantly', 'aftermath', 'update', 'so', 'small', 'illegible', '27', 'screen', 'Information', 'incident', 'widely', 'available', 'internet', 'however', 'one', 'can', 'read', 'justice', 'been', 'slow', 'meager', 'Total', 'running', 'time', '106', 'minutes']",N/A
931303,A2809U2S14N0K1,B000AQKV1C,BernardZ,"[4, 5]","A fascinating movie!!!!The story is set in Ireland, in a small town, we see terrorist make and plant a terrorist bomb. The terrorist then warn the authorities. At that point, I found myself wondering if in any other country would a terrorist group warns people of a bomb? However an understandable blunder, then made it worse as an accident in communication occurred over the location of the bomb. Many die. We then see the families of people that could be affected attempting to find their loved ones. Shortly afterwards a group of the victims are created in a attempt to try to find out why it happened and why little seems to be done about convicting the people that did it! This story revolves on one family, whose son tragically dies. The father of the boy becomes the leader of the group. As they go searching for the truth, they find that the authorities claims that they did not know and that they are doing as much as they can does not seem correct. Many in the group over time, want to give up but they keep coming back to the issues. The group comes to suspect that the ones in authority are not doing much for them as they have a different agenda. The film ends with a police investigation that comes out with a verdict that the police made many blunders in handling the case. A point that the policeman in charge denies.Overall the acting is good but the story makes this a brilliant movie.More proof that a good movie does not need a big budget, big actors or brilliant special effects (something this film has very little of).

It's not a pretty scenic Irish idyllic film. This is an honest look at the suffering of tragic loss. It is NOT about casting blame on who is at fault, although the story line does take some characters on that road of seeking justice. NO, this story is intended to show the members of a close family unit and the disaster that a bomb makes on their lives. One boy was killed, but the rest of the family was also wounded in powerful emotional ways.Thankfully, this is also a story of recovery. Of finding once again a path of returning to life, scarred, but also regained ability to love and relate. For those of us who have experienced a life-shattering moment, which included the death of a loved one, the way back to anything remotely close to normalcy is difficult. Only a new-normal is achievable, and this DVD shows that success reached by one family after the bomb of Omagh.If you look to this film as justification for anyone's actions, you'll not find it. If you view it as tragedy overcome, then you will find some inspiration, but not without feeling the loss yourself. It is that well played out by the actors.

It is almost as if you empathise with everything the characters went through in this gritty portrayl of the terrible events that literally and metaphorically shook the town of Omagh those few short years ago.You share the grief stricken anxiety of waiting for news of the son whose family story lies at the heart of this tale. After all of the carnage and bloodshed which has appeared on television screens in recent years it is impossible to stay dry eyed as events unfold in this harrowing story.The subject matter is difficult, the lessons learned are hard. The search for conclusion by these families is traumatic and very painful. This portrayal is a testament to the film makers and to the actors involved as well as to the strength, determination and resolve of the inhabitants of the city.To me the film makes us all look deep inside ourselves and question our views and attitudes to the issues it raises and puts those views into stark relief.This is a powerful and moving drama. I am not convinced that the rating is adequate for the harrowing scenes of the explosion and it's aftermath. Most people never experience the appalling horror of a terrorist attack.

Twenty-nine people are murdered in a car bomb attack by Real IRA militants opposed to the Good Friday Agreement in Omagh, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. The dead include: Protestants, Catholics, a Mormon teenager, five other teenagers, six children, a pregnant woman with twins, two Spanish tourists, and a few tourists on a day trip from the Irish Republic. It is the worst IRA terrorist attack in history. It is like Northern Ireland's own little 9/11. English filmmaker Pete Travis brings the horror all to life in this gut-wrenching film about distraught father Michael Gallagher's (utterly brilliant Gerard McSorley) quest to bring the men responsible to justice, as his son was killed in the bombing.Make no mistake about it - this terribly sad and powerful film should be a wake-up call to the entire world. In the midst of tumultuous world politics in this day-and-age, 'Omagh' needs to serve as just one example of the horrors of terroristic warfare and the devastation the outcome has for it's innocent victims and their families.

931309,A3KQX5YJVP1R54,B000AQKV1C,Oliver Conant,"[1, 1]","My eldest son was ten years old in 1998. He's now about the age of the boy who is killed, along with 29 other men women and children, in Omagh, a small border town in Northern Ireland. The crime was carried out by terrorists of the so called Real IRA, who may have  wanted to send a message to Sinn Fein that they were not going to give up armed struggle or violence.  The film focuses on the efforts of Michael Gallagher, a quiet, decent man, a garage owner, first to find his son in the immediate aftermath of the carnage, and then in the long frustrating months after the atrocity, as chairman of a family support group. He is an able and eloquent representative, but, increasingly wrapped up in the advocacy process he loses sight of the suffering of his own wife and family.  Gerard McSorley, playing the soft spoken but eloquent bereaved father who as he tells us ""also lost a workmate"" puts on the kind of performance that only a tiny number of actors could even hope to approximate it is so powerful and so moving.  All the nagging, terrible questions that the film raises--was there collusion between the RUC (Royal Ulster Constabulary) and the higher ups in the Real IRA, how trustworthy was a mole in the Real IRA working for the RUC who warned that ""something spectacular"" was in the works, what was the role of MI5, was the police investigation deliberately slowed and interfered with by police officials and politicians in order not to upset the progress of the peace process then going forward--none of these are answered definitively, although before the crawl we learn that not one of the suspected perpetrators has been convicted since the Omagh bombing. The director, Pete Travis keeps everything real.  Omagh shows how fragile human beings are, not just to inconceivable, sickening violence but to lies and violations of trust. Travis has created a kind of threnody of life in the late 20th century that unfortunately has lost not an iota of significance for the first decades of the 21st.

The simple but well-crafted film follows a man named Michael Gallagher and his family after his son Aidan is killed in the blast which took the lives of 29 civilians. The bombing was carried out by ""The Real IRA,"" an offshoot of the original IRA who did not support the peace process agreed to by the latter. There is very little historical context, so anyone looking to learn the background of ""The Troubles"" will not find it here. Instead, it is a moving story about the real effects of terrorism on innocent people caught in the middle of political warfare. The film maintains a very somber tone throughout, and I agree with the other reviewers about the lack of sentimentality. There is little action or suspense, and one could hardly describe the film as exciting. The film is more of an experience rather than ""entertainment."" The only shot of the picturesque Irish landscape is in the opening scene, where the bombers are shown driving through the breath-taking, yet dreary Irish countryside. The most moving part of the film is the immediate aftermath of the bombing, where Gallagher desperately searches for his missing son, only to have his worst fear confirmed. This leads Gallagher to form a support group for the victim's families and embark on a mission to bring the killers to justice.

The tension that builds up to the actual attack is gripping and the reactions of the family members of the victims may be the most haunting images in the movie. As those who survived begin to ask tough questions of the authorities and form a group seeking justice against the Real IRA who committed the attack, Gerard McSorley gives the most credible and understated performance imaginable as the grieved father of a murdered son.I have rarely seen a movie that captures a tragic historical episode with as much realism and class. A truly great film with some incredibly talented acting and directing. As a record of the suffering caused by an act of terrorism it has no equal.",5,Stunningly Realistic,1252540800,"09 10, 2009",2009,821,"['Omagh', 'remarkable', 'film', 'so', 'realistically', 'events', 'surrounding', 'Omagh', 'bombing', 'can', 'forget', 'people', 'are', 'actors', 'tension', 'actual', 'attack', 'gripping', 'reactions', 'family', 'members', 'victims', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'haunting', 'images', 'movie', 'who', 'survived', 'begin', 'ask', 'tough', 'questions', 'authorities', 'form', 'group', 'seeking', 'justice', 'Real', 'IRA', 'who', 'committed', 'attack', 'Gerard', 'McSorley', 'most', 'credible', 'understated', 'performance', 'imaginable', 'grieved', 'father', 'murdered', 'son.I', 'have', 'rarely', 'seen', 'movie', 'tragic', 'historical', 'episode', 'as', 'much', 'realism', 'class', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'acting', 'directing', 'record', 'suffering', 'caused', 'act', 'terrorism', 'equal']",N/A

It seemed as if the peace accords were off to a good start and the tragic bombing of the center of this Northern Irish city potentially put the good work started to a halt. Fortunately the bombing in Omagh was handled somewhat differently than other bombings and the people themselves made certain that their cause was not ignored. Justice ahs been slow and in many cases delayed, but the aftermath of the bombing did show the world that the ""Troubles"" could possibly become a memory of the past. The film OMAGH chronicles the bombing and its aftermath.This film version of the story of Omagh starts Gerard Mc Sorley as Michael Gallagher, a father who looses his teenaged son in the bombing. Gallagher is no stranger to loss. In 1984 he lost a  brother to an IRA bombing which was never settled and he made certain the same would not happen with his son. The film focuses on the outraged people of the city. We see the conflicts between those who immediately want to blame the British and those who believe they have a more enlightened attitude. We see old prejudices surface as well as cover-ups by the governments of Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The film shows the ups and downs of the people as well as their reactions to the news that much of the information and evidence that could catch those responsible was destroyed in a misguided belief by many that forgetting the matter would somehow lead to peace.The film is moving due in no small part to its simple plot and its sparseness. There are no surprising plot twists which allows the viewer to remain focused on the story. This is not a ""forty shades of green"" kind of film where the beauty of Ireland is breathtaking. We do get a sense of the beauty of the land, but this is a working class area that seems to be all but forgotten. This starkness is a perfect backdrop for the film. At the beginning we meet Gallagher's son Aidan, a likeable but not spectacular kid, like any kids on the street. Immediately we feel the loss when we discover his death, reminding us that those lost had people who loved them and their deaths were significant. We understand the toll the loss takes on Michael, as well as his family. OMAGH is a powerful film that will reverberate in the minds and hearts of those who love Ireland, mourn for its often turbulent past, and hope for the wonderful future it so richly deserves.",5,A Poignant Reminder of Northern Ireland's Troubled Past,1142380800,"03 15, 2006",2006,2465,"['bombing', 'Omagh', 'August', '1998', 'caught', 'most', 'world', 'surprise', 'seemed', 'peace', 'accords', 'were', 'off', 'good', 'start', 'tragic', 'bombing', 'center', 'Northern', 'Irish', 'city', 'potentially', 'put', 'good', 'work', 'started', 'halt', 'Fortunately', 'bombing', 'Omagh', 'was', 'handled', 'somewhat', 'differently', 'other', 'bombings', 'people', 'made', 'certain', 'cause', 'was', 'not', 'ignored', 'Justice', 'ahs', 'been', 'slow', 'many', 'cases', 'delayed', 'aftermath', 'bombing', 'did', 'show', 'world', 'Troubles', 'could', 'possibly', 'become', 'memory', 'past', 'film', 'OMAGH', 'bombing', 'aftermath.This', 'film', 'version', 'story', 'Omagh', 'Gerard', 'Mc', 'Sorley', 'Michael', 'Gallagher', 'father', 'who', 'teenaged', 'son', 'bombing', 'Gallagher', 'stranger', 'loss', '1984', 'lost', 'brother', 'IRA', 'bombing', 'was', 'never', 'settled', 'made', 'certain', 'same', 'would', 'not', 'happen', 'son', 'film', 'outraged', 'people', 'city', 'see', 'conflicts', 'who', 'immediately', 'want', 'blame', 'British', 'who', 'believe', 'have', 'more', 'enlightened', 'attitude', 'see', 'old', 'prejudices', 'surface', 'as', 'well', 'cover-ups', 'governments', 'Britain', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Republic', 'Ireland', 'film', 'ups', 'downs', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'reactions', 'news', 'much', 'information', 'evidence', 'could', 'catch', 'responsible', 'was', 'destroyed', 'misguided', 'belief', 'many', 'forgetting', 'matter', 'would', 'somehow', 'lead', 'peace.The', 'film', 'moving', 'due', 'small', 'part', 'simple', 'plot', 'sparseness', 'are', 'surprising', 'plot', 'twists', 'viewer', 'remain', 'focused', 'story', 'not', 'forty', 'shades', 'green', 'kind', 'film', 'where', 'beauty', 'Ireland', 'breathtaking', 'do', 'get', 'sense', 'beauty', 'land', 'working', 'class', 'area', 'be', 'forgotten', 'starkness', 'perfect', 'backdrop', 'film', 'beginning', 'meet', 'Gallagher', 'son', 'Aidan', 'likeable', 'not', 'spectacular', 'kid', 'kids', 'street', 'Immediately', 'feel', 'loss', 'when', 'discover', 'death', 'reminding', 'lost', 'had', 'people', 'who', 'loved', 'deaths', 'were', 'significant', 'understand', 'toll', 'loss', 'Michael', 'as', 'well', 'family', 'OMAGH', 'powerful', 'film', 'will', 'reverberate', 'minds', 'hearts', 'who', 'love', 'Ireland', 'mourn', 'often', 'turbulent', 'past', 'hope', 'wonderful', 'future', 'so', 'richly', 'deserves']",N/A
