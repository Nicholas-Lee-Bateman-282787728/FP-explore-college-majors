Clay ""drakkar91""","[0, 0]","This film really blew me away - not because it was an over-the-top high-budget Hollywood blockbuster set to win an Oscar, but instead, because it a poignant comedy-drama on the topic of gay relationships and AIDS in 1986.  It's an early work in a period before films like this ever made the big time.  Two years later in 1988, Harvey Fierstein brought usTorch Song Trilogythe pre-AIDS era story starring Matthew Broderick and Anne Bancroft (another gem of a film which failed to make the major big screen circuit). Parting Glances features Kathy Kinney and Steve Buscemi (in a role unlike any other I have seen him in).  Overall, the film is light, the acting cute and very accurate for the 80's.  AIDS is not the glaring star of the film, in fact it's much more about a gathering of friends as two lovers prepare for a long separation from one another for work matters.  Years later, films likeLongtime CompanionandPhiladelphiawill serve to bring AIDS full speed ahead for the devastation it reaped upon society. Parting Glances is the light precursor to those films, but handles the topic skillfully and with some levity considering the death sentence AIDS was during this time period.The characters are real people, and the film is well worth your viewing time.  As an added bonus for fans of New York City in the 80's, the film features a scene filmed in the long since gone Limelight Discotheque (for that complete story, watchLimelight).",4,A Surprising Gem Well Ahead of It's Time in 1986,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,1443,"['film', 'really', 'blew', 'away', 'not', 'was', 'over-the-top', 'high-budget', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'set', 'win', 'Oscar', 'instead', 'poignant', 'comedy-drama', 'topic', 'gay', 'relationships', 'AIDS', '1986', 'early', 'work', 'period', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'big', 'time', 'Two', 'years', 'later', '1988', 'Harvey', 'Fierstein', 'brought', 'usTorch', 'Song', 'Trilogythe', 'pre-AIDS', 'era', 'story', 'starring', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'gem', 'film', 'failed', 'make', 'major', 'big', 'screen', 'circuit', 'Parting', 'Glances', 'features', 'Kathy', 'Kinney', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'role', 'other', 'have', 'seen', 'Overall', 'film', 'light', 'acting', 'cute', 'very', 'accurate', '80', 'AIDS', 'not', 'glaring', 'star', 'film', 'fact', 'much', 'more', 'gathering', 'friends', 'two', 'lovers', 'prepare', 'long', 'separation', 'one', 'work', 'matters', 'Years', 'later', 'films', 'likeLongtime', 'CompanionandPhiladelphiawill', 'serve', 'bring', 'AIDS', 'full', 'speed', 'ahead', 'devastation', 'reaped', 'society', 'Parting', 'Glances', 'light', 'precursor', 'films', 'topic', 'skillfully', 'levity', 'considering', 'death', 'sentence', 'AIDS', 'was', 'time', 'period.The', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing', 'time', 'added', 'bonus', 'fans', 'New', 'York', 'City', '80', 'film', 'scene', 'filmed', 'long', 'gone', 'Limelight', 'Discotheque', 'complete', 'story', 'watchLimelight']",N/A

Also, Parting Glances was one of but a few ""gay films"" to get any wide release (Boys in the Band; Cruising; The Gay Deceivers; and Making Love are the only ones that come to mind for me).Following the narrator through a 24 hour period, this film shows the viewer life from the perspective of a gay man who is comfortable with his sexuality - a feat before never done.  As he prepares to leave for Africa, our narrator struggeles with leaving his best friend and former lover, who is dying from AIDS (Steve Buschemi in what I believe was his first film), but the film doesn't get mired down in this.This film is not a downer.Not satisfied to tie everything up neatly, the director has wisely chosen to leave the viewer wanting more.

I recently revisited ""Parting Glances"" and it is a better film than the other three I mentioned. Writer/Director Bill Sherwood manages a serious look at the early days of the AIDS outbreak in New York City while maintaining a light rather than somber mood. Some of the characters are classic stereotypes: the heavyset ""Faghag,"" the portly, lonely rich queen, and the married couple with secrets who love the gay boys. Fortunately, Sherwood coaxes first-rate performances from John Bolger, Richard Ganoung, Steve Buscemi (in the film's best role), and a Pre-""Drew Carey Show"" Kathy Kinney, sans her heavy make-up. Bolger and Ganoung have great chemistry and their relationship is presented as fairly stable, a first in those days. Buscemi, whose character has AIDS, brilliantly creates sympathy without self-pity or heavy-handed melodrama.
