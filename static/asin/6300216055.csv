I'd seen it in the 80s and have always wanted to give it another go.  The material, involving a young naturalist leaving his family and big city life behind to live in the Canadian countryside, is most appealing to me.  I imagine it wouldn't be the most desirable plan to kids of today; but you never know.I'll admit the young actor his bares a striking resembance to the ""Home Alone"" actor, but not so much as the cover suggests.  I mean, he doesn't exactly make friends with the bear either.  Just an attempt to sell it to kids.Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed seeing this film again and was quite happy with the image quality.

The movie was just bad, it really didn't have relevance to the book and just made no sense.  Sam believes he has to run off and live in the forest to do algae experiments, yet comes around to winter he ""learns his lesson"" and decides he'll go home.  There's no depth to the movie really, even Frightful's death which NEVER happened in the book, seemed to be just tacked in there to try and drive some drama home to the viewers.  Read the book, there's no reason to watch this movie other that just to see bad it is compared to the book.  Thankfully I only spent $5 on it because I found it at Walmart.  I don't mind wasting $5 on it since I knew I had to watch the movie since I love the book, but blegh, what a mess.  They even screwed up something as simple as Bando's character, having him one introduce himself as Bando, and two making him a wandering nature musician instead of a teacher...well anyway unless you find it cheap, or maybe even just rent it, I'd honestly past unless you just want to see one of the poorest book adaptations I've ever scene, it probably ranks second next to the Battlefield Earth movie.

The movie strays away from the story entirely too much.  I really don't see the reason why the movie does this either.  The novel would have made the perfect screenplay.  The worst change of all is the death of Sam Gribley's falcon, Frightful, by a hunter in the middle of the film.  Another big change is the addition of a pet raccoon named Gus, which also was not in the book.  The ending was a yet another disappointing change.  There were at least 25 other differences that I spotted between the book and the movie too.As a teacher I still use this movie after my students have read the novel.  However, I use it to prove my point that the novel is usually better then the movie.  I also have my students try to find as many differences between the two as they can.I think that an updated version of this movie, that follows the writing of Jean Craighead-George, would be big a big hit today.If you never read the novel then the movie is fairly good.

I fell in love with the story and was envious of Sam's year in the wilderness.Last night, I found the movie for sale at a local book/music/DVD store. I vaguely remembered that My Side of the Mountain had also been a movie way back when, but I had forgotten all about it. I bought the movie and my wife and I watched it.Ugh. This movie was a waste of time. It was poorly written, abysmally acted, and strayed so far from the book that it was virtually unrecognizable to anyone who read and loved the book.My wife and I got the impression that the movie was adapted by someone who doesn't like hunting or killing of animals. Reference after reference was made in the movie to guns and hunters being bad, killing animals being bad and even Frightful was killed by a hunter apparently out shooting for sport. So Sam never got his deerskin outfit (as he did in the book). Instead, he bought leather gloves and wore some kind of yellow rain slicker during the winter.At one point near the end, when Bando returned to visit, there were so many people in Sam's hollowed out tree that I could have sworn it was a magic tree, much like the magic tents in the latest Harry Potter movie. Small from the outside. But huge on the inside.What an awful movie. Even the cinematography was horrid. If I had to watch Frightful fly around for minutes on end one more time I might have shot her myself.Avoid this movie at all costs!But please, do, read the book.

Well, It's unrealistic to expect this-the movie can not be the book and the book can not be the movie-movies are different than books. You got to take what you like about the book and write the script from that. This is done all the time in Hollywood.

220047,A3CS14AV9JXPOV,6300216055,"P. Robert Maiden Mueller ""Spike Maiden Mller""","[2, 3]","I, too, saw the movie first, as an impressionable youngster, and its impression certainly stuck with me.  My parents bought me the book for Christmas, and I initially had problems with the many differences between the book and the movie.  As my memory of the movie faded, and with rereadings of the book, it became one of my favorites.  So it was with some trepidation that I put in my first copy of the VHS release of the movie.Aside from the death of Frightful, which I must agree is perfectly gratuitous, I don't find the movie a big disappointment.  Ted Eccles, while not a particularly gifted actor, does have a certain screen presence and makes Sam a suitably sympathetic hero.  Theodore Bikkel lends magic to any role he plays, and makes a wonderfully off-center Bando.The anti-hunting sentiments do get a bit tiresome.  The direction and cinematography are able, but not inspired.  The supporting cast contains no jarring notes, and the music, while not superb, is quite good.One can certainly learn a few things about the wilderness from the movie, although not as much as one can from the book.  And if seeing this movie inspires anyone to read the book, it has justified its making.",3,a mixed bag,1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,1193,"['too', 'saw', 'movie', 'first', 'impressionable', 'youngster', 'impression', 'certainly', 'stuck', 'parents', 'bought', 'book', 'Christmas', 'initially', 'had', 'problems', 'many', 'differences', 'book', 'movie', 'memory', 'movie', 'faded', 'rereadings', 'book', 'became', 'one', 'favorites', 'was', 'trepidation', 'put', 'first', 'copy', 'VHS', 'release', 'movie.Aside', 'death', 'Frightful', 'must', 'agree', 'perfectly', 'gratuitous', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'movie', 'big', 'disappointment', 'Ted', 'Eccles', 'not', 'particularly', 'gifted', 'actor', 'have', 'certain', 'screen', 'presence', 'Sam', 'suitably', 'sympathetic', 'hero', 'Theodore', 'Bikkel', 'magic', 'role', 'wonderfully', 'off-center', 'Bando.The', 'anti-hunting', 'sentiments', 'do', 'get', 'bit', 'tiresome', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'are', 'able', 'not', 'inspired', 'supporting', 'cast', 'jarring', 'notes', 'music', 'not', 'superb', 'quite', 'good.One', 'can', 'certainly', 'learn', 'few', 'things', 'wilderness', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'can', 'book', 'seeing', 'movie', 'anyone', 'read', 'book', 'justified', 'making']",My Side of the Mountain VHS
