573993,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B000059PPH,The Mysterious Traveler,"[4, 5]","DEATH BEFORE DISHONOR(1987) Directed by Terry Leonard.Starring Fred Dryer, Joanna Pacula, Paul Winfield and Brian Keith.A group of Marines- a Colonel, his Sergent and several new recruits-- are assigned to a US Embassy in the Middle Eastern country of ""Jamal"" to provide security and act as advisors to our Ally. However a group of Muslim Terrorists have targeted the Embassy with the intent of driving the US out of the country. The Muslim Barbarians have ""advisors"" of their own...a pair of European ""leftists"" aka communist agents of the Soviet Union and a news photographer more than eager to act as the propaganda arm of the group.After a nasty skirmish between the group and Marine Sergent Burns during a theft of American Weapons intended for our ally, the terrorists retaliate with a sustained campaign of kidnapping, murder and brutal torture culminating in a suicide attack. The ambassador decides that, in the face of such barbarism, the United States can do little but evacuate the country abandoning our allies and our men still held captive.Unfortunately Sergent Burns misses the plane and with nothing better to do while waiting for the next flight, decides he might as well go shoot a couple or forty Muslim Barbarians.From the halls of Montezuma Baby!!!!!This film, in the immediate aftermath of Sept 11, 2001, was used as Exhibit A by the Muslim Barbarians and their Allies in Hollywood in the book and documentary REEL BAD ARABS as proof that Hollywood is racist against Arabs. Therefore Hollywood could not POSSIBLY continue with such racism by making any Patriotic Anti Terrorists films(and therefore support the Troops and the country) and, to make amends for DEATH BEFORE DISHONOR, Hollywood must make a slew of Anti-American Proterrorist films(conveniently undercutting the troops and smearing the country).Yeah yeah yeah.........and Mao Zse Tung was an Agrarian reformer, Alger Hiss was framed and Indochina became a paradise once the Reds took over.In the meantime, we have poor old DEATH BEFORE DISHONOR...made over twenty years ago in the wake of the success of RAMBO 2.....getting all this baggage heaped upon its B movie shoulders.First off the film is not Anti-Arab since the film makes a point of showing the US allied with an Arab country and the Marines interacting with and fighting with that country's soldiers........whom presumably are Arab unless Middle Eastern countries are now hiring Swiss Mercanaries. The Terrorists' main goals is to disrupt that alliance and drive the US out of the country so their supporter within the govt(presumably a Red puppet) can then take over. This, historically speaking, would be a bad thing for the common folk aka Arabs since those Muslim Terrorists and their Commie friends DO tend toward repression and genocide do they not??Ah but REEL BAD ARABS never quite mentions that do they. According to the RBA and this film's detractors, the only reel good Arab is one that hates and wants to kill Americans and Jews(here called ""zionists"").Secondly what the film IS against is very plainly stated. 1) Muslim terrorists. 2) Their European Communist handlers and 3) Media types who are blatant shills for A and B. The film also has issues with the torture of American prisoners by Muslim Terrorists and with suicide bombing.Third. The film IS supportive of Israel and generally disapproves of people who like to kill Jews. It also identifies a European ""radical"" as being a pedophile.........which must have driven the Liberals insane since so much of their idealogy hinges on their dreams of being manly chick magnets.And THAT is what REALLY drives the film's critics crazy. Everything else is just smoke and mirrors to hide their Party Line and not incidentally their seething anti-Americanism and Anti-semitism.Now having gotten that out of the way. This is another film where the comrades would do well to just shut up about and stop attracting attention to it. More than likely the film will not ever have a cult following and, as it ages, it is doubtful that our modern film viewer would ever deign to watch something without CGI and that is so oooooooooolllld. So just keep yer yap shut Libs. As it is, I only discovered this film by reading REEL BAD ARABS and deciding that since the Libs did not want me to see it, I had better run out and buy it immediately since it must be pretty good.Is it??Yeah. It is not bad. It is not GUNGA DIN but it is generally a pleasing viewing experience that actually has grown in resonance and catharsis potential due to the War on Terror that it may not have had in the 80s.Is the film especially well directed?? Competently is more like it. Better during the action sequences than during the dramatic moments. The film has that vaguely cheap feel technically and actingwise that so many 80s films seemed to have. The language and gore are about average for the decade as well. The cast is between poor and average. The script---which to its credit actually surprised me twice!!--- is more interesting for what is under the surface than in the admittedly at times thunderfooted dialogue. As with many films in the 80s made with Israeli money behind it, this film has a great deal of historical subtext adding drive and power to its fictional narrative. The country of Jamal is obviously a cross between Lebanon and Jordan. The Arab Terrorists are probably meant to be, at least, partially Palestinian---though their leader has the very interesting name of Jihad indicating that there is something else going on perhaps. The political plot sounds like something that was attempted against King Hussein of Jordan at one time. A terrorist assault in Cyprus also struck this viewer as familiar. The male/female team of European ""radicals"" are obviously based on the hyjackers from the Entebbe business. And the suicide attack/American withdrawal is based on the Marine Barracks attack of 1983.As such, though the film does have its...as stated clunky and awkward moments, it also has real historical thrust and solid action sequences. As such it is one of those films that..though fictional...is actually a more insightful and honest examination of the history it touches upon than most other Hollywood films on the subject that claim to be ""accurate."". Leaving one with an interesting question. What is better? A big budget polished piece of genocidal poisonous propaganda like THE KILLING FIELDS or REDS? Or a hamfisted, rough around the edges morally and historically correct B film......that is fun watching to boot?No masterpiece but very likable.",3,Liberals and Muslim Terrorist sympathizers HATE this film.  So obviously decent people should see it now.,1339286400,"06 10, 2012",2012,6561,"['DEATH', 'BEFORE', 'DISHONOR', '1987', 'Directed', 'Terry', 'Leonard.Starring', 'Fred', 'Dryer', 'Joanna', 'Pacula',
