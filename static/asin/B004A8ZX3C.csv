1393067,AAZRWLML88IZK,B004A8ZX3C,A kids review,"[4, 16]","Look, it can't be denied: penguins are adorable. With that in mind, it's quite understandable why there have been so many films in recent years, from documentaries to CGI-animated tales, centered around our most cuddly, flightless friends. And, of course, adaptations of books are a Hollywood favorite as well, which brings us to Mr. Popper's Penguins. Jim Carrey stars as the titular Mr. Popper, a divorced realtor whose globetrotting father leaves him with crates full of penguins upon his death. Popper decides not to turn the penguins over to the zoo when he observes how much his children love them, and in caring for his new feathered friends, he not only mends his personal relationships, but also succeeds in landing an important and sentimental real estate deal. Based on a children's book from 1938, Mr. Popper's Penguins is pretty standard stuff, which means the plot points are predictable, and there are enough ""aww shucks"" moments for the kids. The film, however, fails to transcend clich&eacute; and become something more.",1,Mr. Popper's Penguins,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,1037,"['Look', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'denied', 'penguins', 'are', 'adorable', 'mind', 'quite', 'understandable', 'why', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'documentaries', 'CGI-animated', 'tales', 'centered', 'most', 'cuddly', 'flightless', 'friends', 'course', 'adaptations', 'books', 'are', 'Hollywood', 'favorite', 'as', 'well', 'Mr.', 'Popper', 'Penguins', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'titular', 'Mr.', 'Popper', 'divorced', 'realtor', 'globetrotting', 'father', 'crates', 'full', 'penguins', 'death', 'Popper', 'not', 'turn', 'penguins', 'zoo', 'when', 'how', 'much', 'children', 'love', 'caring', 'new', 'feathered', 'friends', 'not', 'only', 'personal', 'relationships', 'also', 'landing', 'important', 'sentimental', 'real', 'estate', 'deal', 'Based', 'children', 'book', '1938', 'Mr.', 'Popper', 'Penguins', 'pretty', 'standard', 'stuff', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'predictable', 'are', 'enough', 'aww', 'shucks', 'moments', 'kids', 'film', 'however', 'transcend', 'clich', 'eacute', 'become', 'something', 'more']",Mr. Popper's Penguins

He has, however, succeeded as a high powered real estate developer with designer apartment and ever-present, British assistant who unconciously alliterates her every utterance.  When Popper inherits six penguins, sent by his recently-deceased father from Antarctica, he regains the affections and attention of his estranged family as he turns his slick life and apartment into a snowy playground for the little scene-stealers.  He must defend the tv-watching critters from a slightly evil zookeeper, and he must close on a big real estate deal to keep his job. No plot really matters here: the sight gags are enough....at least for young children.  My 6 and 8 year old granddaughters laughed hysterically at every penguin sequence which is just about every scene.  There is only gentle humor in this movie....no real vitriole or despair.  The kids, thankfully, are not the usual smart alecs, and the ex-wife is a sweetheart, clearly eager to repair the marriage. I think you will enjoy watching your young children enjoy this, and get a few laughs yourself.

1393117,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004A8ZX3C,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[9, 11]","I'm sorry. I forfeited all objectivity once the first penguin waddled on camera. Jim Carrey's past few flicks have been hit or miss with me, and maybe a part of it is that I've gotten accustomed to his schtick, despite the impressive rubber face and manic body contortions that would make a yogi master weep. And maybe I'm still holding NUMBER 23 against him. But what's cuter than an infestation of penguins? My niece and nephews adored this film. MR. POPPER'S PENGUINS, with its predictability and obvious gags, rises above the dreck by dint of penguins. Plus, it's got Carla Gugino, hotness personified.Jim Carrey plays Tommy Popper, a businessman severely focused on his career. But, first, we see Tommy as a child who spends a span of years communicating with his father via ham radio. His dad is an explorer who is always away on exotic expeditions, and, over time, we witness young Tommy grow disillusioned with his absentee father. Thirty years later, Tommy Popper is divorced with custody of his two kids on alternate weekends. Tommy himself has become a neglectful parent. All he's focused on is securing a partnership in his firm, a position guaranteed him once he bags a primo piece of real estate called the Tavern on the Green.The status quo gets topsy-turvied when Tommy receives a shipment of penguin to his upscale New York apartment. And then another crate of five more penguins. When his kids come over for a visit, they fall in love with them. From there the plot unfolds in by-the-numbers fashion. You may guess that Tommy Popper turns over a new leaf and becomes a better father, to the detriment of his career. You may conjecture that he becomes smitten with his ex-wife all over again, although how in heck do you fall out of love with Carla Gugino in the first place? There's fun in watching Popper gradually convert his swank Manhattan duplex into a sub-arctic region, just to accomodate the birds and to connect with his kids. Other than the usual thorny family dilemmas that inevitably crop up, the narrative conflict hinges on Clark Gregg's (a.k.a. S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Agent Colson) scheming NYC zoo official who covets the six penguins because they're of the rarer gentoo breed.I was somewhat impressed when I learned - thru the bonus features - that there's a higher percentage of real penguins in action here than one would assume. (Obviously the scene in which Carrey dances with the penguins is CG-rendered.) Several of the penguins are given enough character traits that they stand out. We learn that ""Captain"" suffers from flight envy. That ""Nimrod"" tends to bump into and fall over things. That ""Stinky""... well, you can guess his specialty. The others - Lovey, Bitey, and Loudy - are descriptive enough. The birds' ridiculous antics won me over. Jim Carrey tones his stuff down, as well, and this is a welcome thing. And I did love his compulsively alliterative personal assistant Pippi (Ophelia Lovibond). I recommend this family flick for those who think penguins are funny. But for those who couldn't care less about penguins - meaning that there's no buffer or filter thru which the bad bits can be digested - there are moments in the movie that simply defy believability (like a penguin hang-gliding) and they well may hike up ye olde blood pressure.

Your life is hectic but predictable.Imagine getting a very unusual gift (turns out, later, to be from your father). It is a live gentoo penguin. Wanting to send it back, you ask for a return crate. You get a new crate all right--filled with five new penguins.What a mess your apartment soon becomes! You get snipped at and dumped on by the penguins. You give them names, such as Nimrod, Stinky, Captain, etc. They are perpetually playful! The penguins swim in the bathtub and spill water all over. Your children from a terminated marriage come to visit, and, having long been alienated from you, absolutely fall in love with the penguins.A nosy neighbor wonders what the noises are from your apartment and, suspecting that he is on to something, wants to tell the board about it. Worse yet, your new nemesis, a penguin specialist who works in the zoo, keeps spying on you. He has a behaviorist view of animals (making animals little more than machines made of flesh), and is determined to take your penguins from you. To him, penguins are simply fish-eating machines. He doubts if a non-specialist can properly care for penguins, and especially ridicules the notion that a loving bond has developed between the penguins and you.In time, you turn your apartment into a winter wonderland, complete with snow, ice skating, etc. Some of the penguins lay eggs, and you are determined that they hatch. Your colleagues from work stumble upon your transformed apartment, and think that you have totally lost your mind. Your penguins follow you around wherever you go, and this produces its own share of comic events.Everything comes to a head from the nosy neighbor, the penguin specialist, the kids, Popper's ex-wife, and his work colleagues. Popper is accused of breaking the law by housing penguins. He is fired from his job. He tries to win his ex-wife back. The penguin specialist has all of Popper's penguins. The apartment is normal once again, and the visiting children are heartbroken. And then... I will not spoil the ending by revealing it.This is a very entertaining and heartwarming movie for the whole family.

If that description appeals to you, I recommend this film.  If Jim Carrey, family films, or general unpretentious cornball discourage you, skip it.  Me, I'm glad I saw it.  Though it ain't great filmic literature, I gut-laughed several times as Carrey interacts with his family, his adopted penguins, and hardball NYC business culture.Once a wide-eyed dreamy boy, Tom Popper sours on his father's empty promises and grows into a cutthroat cynic.  That attitude makes him rich, but also leads to an early divorce and two kids who don't much like him.  Then his dad wills him a small family of penguins.  Forced to care for anything besides his ego, he regains his family, and rediscovers the joy of believing in something bigger.This film pitches at a broad family audience, with Carrey mugging for the camera, while his penguins, mixing live action with CGI, behave like you'd expect.  They act silly, bond with Popper's kids, bat big soulful eyes, and help Carrey perform occasional mildly dirty humor (the scene where Carrey toilet trains his penguins should have kids rolling in the aisles).  It never does much unexpected, but it also doesn't disappoint.In all, this film probably will not have the staying power of Richard & Florence Atwater's novel, which it adapts only loosely.  But it's sweet, big-hearted fun, which should keep kids and their parents happy for a while.  Leaving the theatre, I saw small kids doing the penguin walk, inspired by Charlie Chaplin.

When he was on IN LIVING COLOR and in THE MASK, I thought he was hilarious. But then something happened that always seems to be the way of stand up comedians. Folks tell them they're funny all the time that even them taking a breath is funny. And that's when they stop actually being funny. They continue to do their shtick non-stop but the originality that was there is no longer funny. Carey fell into that category by always seeming to be on, even when doing talk shows and hosting shows.This brings us to his most recent film MR. POPPER'S PENGUINS. Based on the acclaimed children's book, it tells the story of a man who values his job more than anything. Thomas Popper grew up listening to his father on a ham radio, telling him tales of his adventures around the world. But he was rarely there in person. Popper has grown into a man with this same trait.Popper is a closer for a real estate company, the best there is and about to be made a partner. All he needs to do is close on the Tavern on the Green property in Central Park. As this is about to go down he received a call from his father's lawyer. His father has passed away and left him something, an item to be delivered. When the item arrives Popper opens it to find a frozen penguin. Not until he takes it from the box and it thaws does he realize it's still alive. A bucket of ice in the tub and a locked door and he's off to work never realizing the fatal flaw there until he comes home to find his bathroom flooded. Looking for where the penguin came from he calls and asks them to take it back, failing to communicate over a static filled phone and a language barrier that results in more penguins arriving.As if that wasn't enough story we have Popper's family, displaced since his divorce. His son Billy is still young enough to not see problems with his father but Janie is at that tough teen time when everything is a crisis. Even with a touch of advice from his ex-wife Amanda (Carla Gugino) he seems to fail with his daughter. When the kids show for their weekend with him, they're delighted to find the penguins with Billy thinking it's his birthday present.The scenes shift back and forth between Popper trying to acquire the property he's after and adjusting to life with the penguins. While he first sought to send them to the zoo, he slowly grows attached to them. When they have eggs, he's hooked. Unfortunately it doesn't set well with his employers. Viewing the eggs Popper remembers what is important to him, his children and family. So what's the solution?MR. POPPER'S PENGUINS is a feel good movie. It tosses aside all sense of logic and reality in the hopes of offering laughs and touching moments. Forget the fact that Popper opens the doors to his exclusive penthouse and fills it with snow. Or that he might toss aside the major career that enables him to do the things he does here. I'm all for suspending reality but some times it goes a bit far.That being said the penguins are hilarious and adorable. Who wouldn't want to have them in their home? The kids love them and it is through them that Popper finds himself. A misplaced letter from his father that was attached to the first box helps him to find his way.So back to Jim Carey. He does a great job here. He plays for a few laughs along the way and keeps things somewhat subtle. Until the last 10-15 minutes when it seems he goes completely out of control and does the shtick all over again. Here we are 17 years since ACE VENTURA and THE MASK and he still mugs for the camera. The result is another movie to add to the list of films Carrey could have made better.But kids will enjoy the movie. They'll love the penguins and beg to have one of their own. Carrey fans will think he's still a comedic genius. Gugino fans will still think she's beautiful. And life will go on. This is a movie that you'll add to your collection for your kids more than yourself. And if they enjoy it, then its worth having.",3,HERO FINDS HEART,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,4023,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'out', 'way', 'When', 'was', 'IN', 'LIVING', 'COLOR', 'THE', 'MASK', 'thought', 'was', 'hilarious', 'then', 'something', 'happened', 'always', 'be', 'way', 'stand', 'up', 'comedians', 'Folks', 'tell', ""'re"", 'funny', 'time', 'even', 'taking', 'breath', 'funny', 'when', 'stop', 'actually', 'being', 'funny', 'continue', 'do', 'shtick', 'non-stop', 'originality', 'was', 'longer', 'funny', 'Carey', 'fell', 'category', 'always', 'seeming', 'be', 'even', 'when', 'doing', 'talk', 'shows', 'hosting', 'shows.This', 'brings', 'most', 'recent', 'film', 'MR.', 'POPPER', 'PENGUINS', 'Based', 'acclaimed', 'children', 'book', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'job', 'more', 'anything', 'Thomas', 'Popper', 'grew', 'up', 'listening', 'father', 'ham', 'radio', 'telling', 'tales', 'adventures', 'world', 'was', 'rarely', 'there', 'person', 'Popper', 'grown', 'man', 'same', 'trait.Popper', 'closer', 'real', 'estate', 'company', 'best', 'be', 'made', 'partner', 'do', 'close', 'Tavern', 'Green', 'property', 'Central', 'Park', 'go', 'down', 'received', 'call', 'father', 'lawyer', 'father', 'passed', 'away', 'left', 'something', 'item', 'be', 'delivered', 'When', 'item', 'Popper', 'find', 'frozen', 'penguin', 'Not', 'box', 'thaws', 'realize', 'still', 'alive', 'bucket', 'ice', 'tub', 'locked', 'door', 'work', 'never', 'realizing', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'there', 'home', 'find', 'bathroom', 'flooded', 'Looking', 'where', 'penguin', 'came', 'take', 'back', 'failing', 'communicate', 'over', 'static', 'filled', 'phone', 'language', 'barrier', 'results', 'more', 'penguins', 'arriving.As', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'story', 'have', 'Popper', 'family', 'displaced', 'divorce', 'son', 'Billy', 'still', 'young', 'enough', 'not', 'see', 'problems', 'father', 'Janie', 'tough', 'teen', 'time', 'when', 'everything', 'crisis', 'Even', 'touch', 'advice', 'ex-wife', 'Amanda', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'fail', 'daughter', 'When', 'kids', 'show', 'weekend', ""'re"", 'delighted', 'find', 'penguins', 'Billy', 'thinking', 'birthday', 'present.The', 'scenes', 'shift', 'back', 'forth', 'Popper', 'trying', 'acquire', 'property', 'adjusting', 'life', 'penguins', 'first', 'sought', 'send', 'zoo', 'slowly', 'attached', 'When', 'have', 'eggs', 'hooked', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'set', 'well', 'employers', 'Viewing', 'eggs', 'Popper', 'remembers', 'what', 'important', 'children', 'family', 'what', 'solution', 'MR', 'POPPER', 'PENGUINS', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'aside', 'sense', 'logic', 'reality', 'hopes', 'offering', 'laughs', 'touching', 'moments', 'Forget', 'fact', 'Popper', 'doors', 'exclusive', 'penthouse', 'snow', 'might', 'toss', 'major', 'career', 'do', 'things', 'here', ""'m"", 'suspending', 'reality', 'times', 'bit', 'far.That', 'being', 'said', 'penguins', 'are', 'hilarious', 'adorable', 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'home', 'kids', 'love', 'Popper', 'misplaced', 'letter', 'father', 'was', 'attached', 'first', 'box', 'find', 'way.So', 'back', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'few', 'laughs', 'way', 'things', 'somewhat', 'subtle', 'last', '10-15', 'minutes', 'when', 'completely', 'control', 'shtick', 'over', 'again', 'Here', 'are', '17', 'years', 'ACE', 'VENTURA', 'THE', 'MASK', 'still', 'camera', 'result', 'movie', 'add', 'list', 'films', 'Carrey', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'better.But', 'kids', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'love', 'penguins', 'beg', 'have', 'one', 'own', 'Carrey', 'fans', 'will', 'think', 'still', 'comedic', 'genius', 'Gugino', 'fans', 'will', 'still', 'think', 'beautiful', 'life', 'will', 'go', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'add', 'collection', 'kids', 'more', 'enjoy', 'then', 'worth', 'having']",Mr. Popper's Penguins

Carrey's performance goes beyond the simply goofy, slapstick characters he played early in his career to become more nuanced and human, yet still terrifically funny as always.  A man whose own father neglected him, Carrey's character is an exceptionally successful business executive who is on the verge at first of becoming the same kind of father that his own father was, but taking care of the adorable but quirky and demanding penguins wakes him up to the fact that family is the most important thing in his life.  At the end, a letter from his father helps him realize what he must do in order to get his life back into balance, and he brings his fragmented family back together and gets his life back.This DVD was so much fun to watch that after watching it the first time, I watched it again right afterward with the commentary turned on, and then I watched it again the next day with my 85-year-old mother, who laughed at various points in the story.  This to me is the kind of movie that never loses its appeal.  Far more so than the ubiquitous ""A Christmas Story,"" this movie has the kind of lasting appeal that really works--not just because of nostalgia but because it is endlessly entertaining and it satisfies the heart.  In addition, the filmmakers include just enough character actor roles to make this film pop.  The bellman who figures out how to make money off Carrey's flouting the building's rules and Angela Lansbury, who plays the little old lady with a lot more verve and irreverence than you would expect, plus the p-obssessed assistant, all add their own bit of humor to the story and people it with wonderful elements of comedy worked nicely into the already preposterous plot (see, I'm doing the p's too).If you need a movie that everyone in the family is likely to enjoy, this is the one.  Jim Carrey is at his best ever, the casting is outstanding, and the movie just works.  From beginning to end, its fun interwoven with heartfelt moments captivated me and made me laugh.  I love this movie, and I hope they're planning a sequel to it with more impossible but ridiculously funny circumstances demonstrating the new grace and warmth that Carrey shows in this film.  Rent the DVD and see if you feel the same way about it.  If so, you'll want to buy it and make it part of your family DVD library for those days when you need a laugh or the comfort of a warm family moment.  It's definitely a keeper.",5,"A hilarious romp, Jim Carrey at his best",1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,2646,"['gem', 'movie', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'considerable', 'talent', 'delightfully', 'amusing', 'concept', 'unexpected', 'gift', 'six', 'penguins', 'heartwarming', 'hilarious', 'film', 'never', 'still', 'long', 'Carrey', 'performance', 'simply', 'goofy', 'slapstick', 'characters', 'played', 'early', 'career', 'become', 'more', 'nuanced', 'human', 'yet', 'still', 'terrifically', 'funny', 'always', 'man', 'own', 'father', 'neglected', 'Carrey', 'character', 'exceptionally', 'successful', 'business', 'executive', 'who', 'verge', 'first', 'becoming', 'same', 'kind', 'father', 'own', 'father', 'was', 'taking', 'care', 'adorable', 'quirky', 'demanding', 'penguins', 'wakes', 'up', 'fact', 'family', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'life', 'end', 'letter', 'father', 'realize', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'order', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'balance', 'fragmented', 'family', 'back', 'together', 'life', 'back.This', 'DVD', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'again', 'right', 'afterward', 'commentary', 'turned', 'then', 'watched', 'again', 'next', 'day', '85-year-old', 'mother', 'who', 'laughed', 'various', 'points', 'story', 'kind', 'movie', 'never', 'appeal', 'Far', 'more', 'so', 'ubiquitous', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'movie', 'kind', 'lasting', 'appeal', 'really', 'not', 'just', 'nostalgia', 'endlessly', 'entertaining', 'heart', 'addition', 'filmmakers', 'include', 'just', 'enough', 'character', 'actor', 'roles', 'make', 'film', 'pop', 'bellman', 'who', 'out', 'how', 'make', 'money', 'Carrey', 'flouting', 'building', 'rules', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'who', 'little', 'old', 'lady', 'lot', 'more', 'verve', 'irreverence', 'would', 'expect', 'p-obssessed', 'assistant', 'add', 'own', 'bit', 'humor', 'story', 'people', 'wonderful', 'elements', 'comedy', 'worked', 'nicely', 'already', 'preposterous', 'plot', 'see', ""'m"", 'doing', 'p', 'too', '.If', 'need', 'movie', 'everyone', 'family', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'one', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'best', 'ever', 'casting', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'just', 'works', 'beginning', 'end', 'fun', 'interwoven', 'heartfelt', 'moments', 'captivated', 'made', 'love', 'movie', 'hope', ""'re"", 'planning', 'sequel', 'more', 'impossible', 'ridiculously', 'funny', 'circumstances', 'demonstrating', 'new', 'grace', 'warmth', 'Carrey', 'film', 'Rent', 'DVD', 'see', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'so', ""'ll"", 'want', 'buy', 'make', 'part', 'family', 'DVD', 'library', 'days', 'when', 'need', 'laugh', 'comfort', 'warm', 'family', 'moment', 'definitely', 'keeper']",Mr. Popper's Penguins

In the printed story, there was logical sequence of a man and his wife arguing about the obsession of the husband with Antarctica and his luck in getting live Penguins shipped to his home after expressing his fascination with Penguins. In the movie, Mr. Popper was a cold blooded calculating man who lacks passion for animals unless he was forces to do so in order to appease his kids from a broken marriage.The movie spoiled the great story by injecting the distracting business deals with an opinionated and objective business man living in city building surrounded by a forest concrete high-rises and stones roads in all directions. The first scene of over flooded bathroom was too fake to laugh at, and once you start imaging the sliding body under the gigantic water wave, you are being shown a man with dried cloth hanging on the edge of the stairwell with a Penguin turning to move his bowel on the man's face.You quickly get the suspicion of toy penguins positioned to perform man-made jokes rather than letting penguins be penguins.Unfortunately, a great story that would have been a greater success had the moviemaker persevered in perfecting the art of exposing the natural beauty of real penguins and have refrained from the nonsense of entangling the urban ugliness of aloof business people with the natural beauty of exotic animals.So, the children book of the domesticated penguins that made one man's dream come true was turned by the movie into a an adult comedy in poor taste.",3,Could have been a greater movie had the Penguins been utilized to their utmost potential,1308614400,"06 21, 2011",2011,1695,"['Could', 'have', 'been', 'greater', 'movie', 'had', 'Penguins', 'been', 'utilized', 'utmost', 'potentialReading', 'Mr.', 'Popper', 'Penguins', 'elementary', 'school', 'kids', 'sure', 'fun', 'watching', 'twisted', 'tale', 'movie', 'printed', 'story', 'was', 'logical', 'sequence', 'man', 'wife', 'arguing', 'obsession', 'husband', 'Antarctica', 'luck', 'getting', 'live', 'Penguins', 'shipped', 'home', 'expressing', 'fascination', 'Penguins', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Popper', 'was', 'cold', 'blooded', 'calculating', 'man', 'who', 'passion', 'animals', 'was', 'forces', 'do', 'so', 'order', 'appease', 'kids', 'broken', 'marriage.The', 'movie', 'spoiled', 'great', 'story', 'injecting', 'distracting', 'business', 'deals', 'opinionated', 'objective', 'business', 'man', 'living', 'city', 'building', 'surrounded', 'forest', 'concrete', 'high-rises', 'stones', 'roads', 'directions', 'first', 'scene', 'flooded', 'bathroom', 'was', 'too', 'fake', 'laugh', 'once', 'start', 'imaging', 'sliding', 'body', 'gigantic', 'water', 'wave', 'are', 'being', 'shown', 'man', 'dried', 'cloth', 'hanging', 'edge', 'stairwell', 'Penguin', 'turning', 'move', 'bowel', 'man', 'face.You', 'quickly', 'get', 'suspicion', 'toy', 'penguins', 'positioned', 'perform', 'man-made', 'jokes', 'rather', 'letting', 'penguins', 'be', 'penguins.Unfortunately', 'great', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'greater', 'success', 'had', 'moviemaker', 'persevered', 'perfecting', 'art', 'exposing', 'natural', 'beauty', 'real', 'penguins', 'have', 'refrained', 'nonsense', 'entangling', 'urban', 'ugliness', 'aloof', 'business', 'people', 'natural', 'beauty', 'exotic', 'animals.So', 'children', 'book', 'domesticated', 'penguins', 'made', 'one', 'man', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'was', 'turned', 'movie', 'adult', 'comedy', 'poor', 'taste']",Mr. Popper's Penguins

My wife rented this film to watch tonight without reading any reviews first.  She knew the book.  I found it mildly funny.  It had a lot of CGI penguin scenes in it.  I'm sure the book is better than the film.The movie could have been far better if the script hadn't been taylored to Jim Carey.  Instead Jim should have adapted himself to the character.  Carey often goes a little too far in his movies.  This one is no exception.But as long as the movie audiance will buy a ticket or pay to buy or rent a film, it's the money that drives the industry.  Not the quality of the product.This movie has a lot of contrived scenes that couldn't possibly happen in real life.  Consider that his upstairs bathroom has become a swimming pool and when the door is opened the apartment is flooded.  But yet no one knows he has penguins in his upscale apartment save but for one neighbor.  So thousands of gallons of water won't flood other apartments downstairs?  Really.  Cute but no cigar.A little history research on the Tavern on The Green also shows the building is not privately owned but is owned by the city of New York and has always been owned by the city since the Tavern first opened in 1934.  Therefore no one can sell the building to anyone unless the city sells it.  The building is leased as a restaurant but that closed in 2009 and is now an information center and gift shop for the city.Food vendors sell food outside.

1393188,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B004A8ZX3C,Steve,"[10, 18]","Mr. Popper's Penguins is another in Jim Carrey's career plan to turn into the next Eddie Murphy;  a talented comic actor who can't stop making cornball family movies that are short on creativity, good writing, and plausibility and long on clowning and shtick. In this latest offering, Carrey even explains his gags now, entirely re-issued from his earlier films, as if to be ironic as well as funny. I enjoy Jim Carrey's talent but I can't understand why he isn't smart enough to hold out for something better (same question directed at Eddie Murphy).MPP suffers from the same things that seem to define family movies nowadays; brash children (although, to be fair, toned down significantly from other performances - note the less bratty performance from Madeline Carroll who played a much more horrid teenager in The Spy Next Door), cute animals who they insist have to perform some bodily function to get laughs, and a weak and predictable moral lesson about what really matters in life. What's worse is that they use classic children's stories as the vehicles for such dreck. They can't even come up with their own stories. They have to destroy cherished classic books. Wouldn't it have been better to gather the family for a reading of the book instead of mindlessly vegging in front of this awful movie? What's even better is that they could've watched the movie and then spent a stimulating post-movie bonding time dissecting just how badly the movie failed and teaching the greater lesson that entertainment doesn't have to be poop jokes and facial contortions.Tons of families will enjoy it, buy it to add to their burgeoning collection of visual stimuli to make up Family Night, and everyone makes a pretty penny. Am I the only one who sees the waste of talent, the lack of effort, and the insult to the audience? Beyond that, isn't there some parental responsibility to not inundate your children with feeble entertainment? Isn't there enough garbage on tv to negate the need to actually purchase such a terrible movie? Aren't there hundreds of better things for you and your children to do than sit in front of the t.v. to watch this insipid film?

The original book, written by Richard and Florence Atwater in the 1930's, is still one of the most read tales for the elementary school set, having been consistently published since its original printing.  The tale has been updated, and Mr. Popper (Carrey), is now a high-powered businessman who receives a shipment of penguins from the will of his deceased father, an explorer who chose his around-the-world adventures over his son.  Popper the junior finds himself in the same situation, having to choose between his hotshot Manhattan sales job and his two kids (and his never lessened feelings for his ex-wife (nicely portrayed by Carla Gugino)).Leave it to the penguins to help Popper make the appropriate choices in the end.  Penguins have proven to be the recent bird of success in the world of cinema, whether in a documentary (""March of the Penguins"") or in animation (""Happy Feet"" and ""Madagascar""), so director Mark Waters wisely gives equal time between Carrey's frequently improvised quips and the adorable exploits of his feathered co-stars.Extras include interesting behind-the-scenes looks at both the real and CGI penguins on the set, the requisite Gag Reel, and a fascinating look at the history of the Atwaters' story.

This movie is a rare thing lately. A family movie that the entire family will enjoy. Most of the so called family movies lately are a struggle for parents to get through. This one is a joy to watch and Jim Carrey is perfectly cast, no one works with animals like he can. There is enough adult humor and content in this for the parents to enjoy, and more then enough to keep the kids watching and laughing. This is one of the best family movies to come out in a long time and is very much worth watching. Overall, a great family movie that the entire family will actually enjoy.

1393200,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B004A8ZX3C,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","In ""Mr. Popper's Penguins,"" Jim Carrey plays Tom Hopper, a successful Manhattan realtor, who inherits six penguins after his father's death, and reluctantly starts keeping them in his apartment. The rest of the film is exactly what we expect from a family picture with Jim Carrey and six gentoo penguins: comedic mayhem and slapstick interludes (including water sliding in Guggenheim Museum) followed by a big question. Will Mr. Popper change?The predictable story is fine with me, but aside from Jim Carrey's protagonist, most characters in ""Mr. Popper's Penguins"" are bland stereotypes. What is worse, it seems filmmakers thought they need a conventional ""villain"" in this film. So instead of sending the penguins to a zoo (as most people would do), Carrey's hero and his kids must protect ""their"" penguins from a zoo official (Clark Gregg), painted in a terribly negative light.In spite of the clich&eacute;d and uninspired story, Jim Carrey remains fun to watch throughout. Given the outlandish situation of ""a life with penguins,"" he delivers restrained acting, though he still manages to pull off some nice sight gags and impressions.Several subplots are incorporated into the main story. They are about Tom Popper, who wants his ex-wife Amanda (Carla Gugino) back; who is tasked to buy a restaurant Tavern on the Green; and whose father, it is suggested, had been travelling around the world since Tom was a child. None of them is interesting. Veterans like Philip Baker Hall and Angela Lansbury are sadly wasted.""Mr. Popper's Penguins"" is directed by Mark Waters (""Mean Girls"" ""The Spiderwick Chronicles""), who did much better jobs in the past. He is a reliable director, and Jim Carrey does his best, but the film needs a better script with a more coherent storyline.",3,(2.5 STARS) Jim Carrey and Six Penguins in a Family Picture,1348876800,"09 29, 2012",2012,1776,"['Mr.', 'Popper', 'Penguins', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Tom', 'Hopper', 'successful', 'Manhattan', 'realtor', 'who', 'six', 'penguins', 'father', 'death', 'reluctantly', 'keeping', 'apartment', 'rest', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'expect', 'family', 'picture', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'six', 'gentoo', 'penguins', 'comedic', 'mayhem', 'slapstick', 'interludes', 'including', 'water', 'sliding', 'Guggenheim', 'Museum', 'followed', 'big', 'question', 'Will', 'Mr.', 'Popper', 'change', 'predictable', 'story', 'fine', 'aside', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'protagonist', 'most', 'characters', 'Mr.', 'Popper', 'Penguins', 'are', 'bland', 'stereotypes', 'What', 'worse', 'filmmakers', 'thought', 'need', 'conventional', 'villain', 'film', 'So', 'instead', 'sending', 'penguins', 'zoo', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'do', 'Carrey', 'hero', 'kids', 'must', 'protect', 'penguins', 'zoo', 'official', 'Clark', 'Gregg', 'painted', 'terribly', 'negative', 'light.In', 'spite', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'uninspired', 'story', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'fun', 'watch', 'Given', 'outlandish', 'situation', 'life', 'penguins', 'restrained', 'acting', 'still', 'pull', 'off', 'nice', 'sight', 'gags', 'impressions.Several', 'subplots', 'are', 'incorporated', 'main', 'story', 'are', 'Tom', 'Popper', 'who', 'ex-wife', 'Amanda', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'back', 'who', 'tasked', 'buy', 'restaurant', 'Tavern', 'Green', 'father', 'suggested', 'had', 'been', 'travelling', 'world', 'Tom', 'was', 'child', 'None', 'interesting', 'Veterans', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'are', 'sadly', 'wasted.', 'Mr', 'Popper', 'Penguins', 'directed', 'Mark', 'Waters', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'who', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'jobs', 'past', 'reliable', 'director', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'best', 'film', 'better', 'script', 'more', 'coherent', 'storyline']",Mr. Popper's Penguins

If you are looking for that Carrey brand of comedy in this one, you will be severely disappointed.  However, taken as simply a family-friendly flick, ""Mr. Popper's Penguins"" is a fun little effort that can be enjoyed by quite literally the entire family.For a basic plot summary, ""Popper"" focuses on the life of one Mr. Popper (Carrey), who is completely absorbed in his work and therefore has little time for his divorced wife (Carla Gugino) or two young children.  When his recently deceased father sends Mr. Popper a gift of six penguins, however, they become equal parts blessing and curse as he tries to manage the pesky birds while at the same time bringing his family together around them.There are a lot of cute things in this movie for the kiddies, including the hi-jinks of the penguins themselves, a simplistic love story that even the really young ones will understand, and a secretary who is fixated on the letter ""P"", providing some interesting humor throughout.  The children will easily get sucked into this one right away, and it does just enough to keep the adults from dozing off too.Though I was warned that this movie was ""no good"" by a huge Jim Carrey fan in my family, I watched it with my younger sister and enjoyed the experience.  You just have to go into with the mindset that it isn't really a comedy, at least not by the traditional Carrey standards.  It is family-focused from beginning to end, kind of reminding me of ""Even Almighty"" and its performance from Steve Carrell.Simply put, ""Mr. Popper's Penguins"" isn't anything to blow you away, but if you are looking for a good ""family movie night"" effort that won't offend anyone and might even get a few laughs along the way, then this one is a sure-fire bet.",3,"A Family Effort, Through & Through",1350691200,"10 20, 2012",2012,1885,"['When', 'one', 'face', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'cover', 'film', 'one', 'certain', 'type', 'movie-going', 'experience', 'certain', 'type', 'comedy', 'are', 'looking', 'Carrey', 'brand', 'comedy', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'severely', 'disappointed', 'However', 'taken', 'simply', 'family-friendly', 'flick', 'Mr.', 'Popper', 'Penguins', 'fun', 'little', 'effort', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'quite', 'literally', 'entire', 'family.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Popper', 'life', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Popper', 'Carrey', 'who', 'completely', 'absorbed', 'work', 'therefore', 'little', 'time', 'divorced', 'wife', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'When', 'recently', 'deceased', 'father', 'Mr.', 'Popper', 'gift', 'six', 'penguins', 'however', 'become', 'equal', 'parts', 'blessing', 'curse', 'manage', 'pesky', 'birds', 'same', 'time', 'bringing', 'family', 'together', 'are', 'lot', 'cute', 'things', 'movie', 'kiddies', 'including', 'hi-jinks', 'penguins', 'simplistic', 'love', 'story', 'even', 'really', 'young', 'ones', 'will', 'understand', 'secretary', 'who', 'fixated', 'letter', 'P', 'providing', 'interesting', 'humor', 'children', 'will', 'easily', 'get', 'sucked', 'one', 'right', 'away', 'just', 'enough', 'keep', 'adults', 'dozing', 'off', 'was', 'warned', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'huge', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'fan', 'family', 'watched', 'younger', 'sister', 'enjoyed', 'experience', 'just', 'have', 'go', 'mindset', ""n't"", 'really', 'comedy', 'least', 'not', 'traditional', 'Carrey', 'standards', 'family-focused', 'beginning', 'end', 'kind', 'reminding', 'Even', 'Almighty', 'performance', 'Steve', 'Carrell.Simply', 'put', 'Mr.', 'Popper', 'Penguins', ""n't"", 'anything', 'blow', 'away', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'family', 'movie', 'night', 'effort', 'wo', ""n't"", 'offend', 'anyone', 'might', 'even', 'get', 'few', 'laughs', 'way', 'then', 'one', 'sure-fire', 'bet']",Mr. Popper's Penguins
