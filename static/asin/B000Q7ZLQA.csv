E Jackson,"[0, 1]","I tried to like Played, but in the end I can't help feeling like *I* got played just by WATCHING it.A supposed gangster movie that takes place in England, but it sure didn't feel like it.  None of the characters were convincing in their aggression or ruthlessness, and the acting skills were some of the weakest performances you will ever see.As far as suspense goes, yes, there was some of that.  Not that it was enough to save the pitiful storytelling of course.The camera angles were nice.  I'll give the film a little credit for *that* at least.  It really captured the rundown back streets where much of the film took place.  Of course it was probably the low budget production that mainly contributed to the atmosphere, but at least there *was* an atmosphere.Val Kilmer's character was a letdown.  Usually he saves otherwise atrocious storylines, but not this time.  His character wasn't enough to save a miserable storyline.Played just didn't do enough to win me over.  In fact it didn't even attempt to win me over.  It just dragged on and on trying to tell a story, but it wasn't enough to save me from the eventual boredom.  A stronger story was definitely needed.  I recommend completely skipping this one.",1,bad stuff,1267920000,"03 7, 2010",2010,1217,"['tried', 'like', 'Played', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', '*I*', 'got', 'played', 'just', 'WATCHING', 'it.A', 'supposed', 'gangster', 'movie', 'place', 'England', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'None', 'characters', 'were', 'convincing', 'aggression', 'ruthlessness', 'acting', 'skills', 'were', 'weakest', 'performances', 'will', 'ever', 'see.As', 'far', 'suspense', 'yes', 'was', 'Not', 'was', 'enough', 'save', 'pitiful', 'storytelling', 'course.The', 'camera', 'angles', 'were', 'nice', ""'ll"", 'give', 'film', 'little', 'credit', '*that*', 'least', 'really', 'captured', 'rundown', 'back', 'where', 'much', 'film', 'took', 'place', 'course', 'was', 'probably', 'low', 'budget', 'production', 'mainly', 'contributed', 'atmosphere', 'least', 'atmosphere.Val', 'Kilmer', 'character', 'was', 'letdown', 'Usually', 'otherwise', 'atrocious', 'storylines', 'not', 'time', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'save', 'miserable', 'storyline.Played', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'enough', 'win', 'over', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'attempt', 'win', 'just', 'dragged', 'trying', 'tell', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'save', 'eventual', 'boredom', 'A', 'stronger', 'story', 'was', 'definitely', 'needed', 'recommend', 'completely', 'skipping', 'one']",Played
1074601,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B000Q7ZLQA,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[4, 7]","""Played"" demonstrates what independent films do best, creating involving, character-driven tales on a budget that would make a television commercial! This crime drama, set in London and L.A., offers enough twists to keep viewers guessing, a cast of 'A-List' actors at the top of their game, and production values that bely the microscopic budget.A heist gone wrong, set up by a crooked London cop (Vinnie Jones) and his fixer (Patrick Bergin), lands the small-time crook who led the thieves (Mick Rossi) in prison for eight years. Upon his release, he is recruited to fly to L.A. to track down and kill Bergin, by the gangster father (Roy Doltrice) of another member of Rossi's team (Trevor Nugent), who had been murdered. But there is far more going on than he realizes...Working from a script outline (by Rossi and director Imran Ahktar), the dialog is frequently improvised, by an amazing array of talent, including Gabriel Byrne, Val Kilmer, Anthony LaPaglia, Joanne Whalley, Patsy Kensit, and Bruno Kirby (in his final film role). The result is an edginess and heightened sense of reality that a polished Hollywood script could never have achieved. As Rossi says, in the 'Making of' Special Feature, this was ""guerrilla film making"" in it's purest form, and it succeeds, extremely well.Take a chance on this little gem; I think you'll be hooked!",4,Indie Crime film Scores on Shoestring Budget...,1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,1350,"['Played', 'what', 'independent', 'films', 'do', 'best', 'creating', 'involving', 'character-driven', 'tales', 'budget', 'would', 'make', 'television', 'commercial', 'crime', 'drama', 'set', 'London', 'L.A.', 'enough', 'twists', 'keep', 'viewers', 'guessing', 'cast', 'A-List', 'actors', 'top', 'game', 'production', 'values', 'bely', 'microscopic', 'budget.A', 'heist', 'gone', 'wrong', 'set', 'up', 'crooked', 'London', 'cop', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'fixer', 'Patrick', 'Bergin', 'small-time', 'crook', 'who', 'led', 'thieves', 'Mick', 'Rossi', 'prison', 'eight', 'years', 'release', 'recruited', 'fly', 'L.A.', 'track', 'down', 'kill', 'Bergin', 'gangster', 'father', 'Roy', 'Doltrice', 'member', 'Rossi', 'team', 'Trevor', 'Nugent', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'murdered', 'far', 'more', 'going', 'Working', 'script', 'outline', 'Rossi', 'director', 'Imran', 'Ahktar', 'dialog', 'frequently', 'improvised', 'amazing', 'array', 'talent', 'including', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Anthony', 'LaPaglia', 'Joanne', 'Whalley', 'Patsy', 'Kensit', 'Bruno', 'Kirby', 'final', 'film', 'role', 'result', 'edginess', 'heightened', 'sense', 'reality', 'polished', 'Hollywood', 'script', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'achieved', 'Rossi', ""'Making"", 'Special', 'Feature', 'was', 'guerrilla', 'film', 'making', 'purest', 'form', 'extremely', 'well.Take', 'chance', 'little', 'gem', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hooked']",Played

And how the bleep did he ending starring in four films? Because he absolutely sucks bollocks as a lead actor.I'll tell you why.My guess, and based on two suckfest flicks I've screened, because he paid for them.Seriously. If you look at his IMDb Profile and/or do any kind of net search - you come up with nada.I've met self-aborbed fools like this before. Too rich and too conceited to ever believe anything but their version of the truth, like: You're too old. You're not particularly memorable looking. And oh yeah, you can't act for bleep.My own particular brand of pretentious braggart experience was a Wall Street guy who was convinced he knew how to run a club/restaurant which folded in less than 8 months - and only because he poured money into it the last six before realizing it died two weeks after the opening.Does that stop them? Nope.Now, typically these poseurs tend to serve their narcissism by being the ""executive producer"" - which allows them entr&eacute; into Hollywood and the beautiful people; and where he gets to shine his knob on some wannabe actresses. That would be typical.But oh no, not Mr. Mick Rossi. No, he has to *star* in his movies. (cue The Gloria Swanson's closeup in 'Sunset Boulevard')This is why you never ever let the rich do anything 'cept pay for the damn film. Let them hang out with some babes, give them a posh seat with their name stenciled on the back, and let them lounge in a comfy trailer. But never ever let them talk you into starring in a film - not ever - for any amount of money.This proves once and for all that you actually have to work your way to the top, even in the movies.Just for laughs - notice how Amazon (and other movie services) list the ""starring actors"" for this and other Rossi productions.

Well there in lies the answer, a studio didn't pay to make the film.  Mick Rossi (from the 70's UK punk band SLAUGHTER AND THE DOGS) wrote, directed and starred in this film and spent his own money to get the film made.  With this little money Mick was still able to get some of the biggest names in Hollywood including Gabriel Byrne, Val Kilmer and Vinnie Jones to help him create his film.Not only is that impressive, but as well the fact that 80% of the films dialogue is completely improvised adds a whole new layer of interest to this film.Of course while the plot is nothing new, it is still great to see their are filmmakers willing to shoot their films without the support of some huge corporation that only cares about making money, not making good films!BRAVO MR.
