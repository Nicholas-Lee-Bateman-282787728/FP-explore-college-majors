Sure, but this movie is a love story and not a theological discourse. And as a love story, it soars heavenward.I'd never been a big Meryl Streep fan until I saw DYL. For the film to work, Streep has to convince you that she's a woman you'd want to spend eternity with. She pulls it off and then some.Rip Torn does a comic turn as Brooks' lawyer in the hereafter that should have gotten him at least an Oscar nomination. And as for Brooks, well, you're either a big fan or you're not. Count me in the former camp.BONUS: The original score, by Michael Gore, is easily one of the best I've ever heard. The final six or seven minutes of DYL are a near-perfect marriage of movie music and movie magic.

Having not seen Defending Your Life yet, I went out and rented it.I loved this movie!  It's about a man who dies and goes to &quot;Judgement City&quot;, and has to defend the actions he took in his life.  Some of the lines are so funny too!  It gets richer and richer through each viewing.  Plus, you'll probably end up watching this a few times, because you'll want to show it to your friends.Albert Brooks is great as always, but it was a joy to see Meryl Streep.  She adds so much to her role and creates some nice scenes with Brooks.  However, I  LOVED the ending.  It was one of the most satisfying I'd seen in a while, and it made me feel great inside.I still can't believe Albert Brooks writes, directs, and stars in most of his works.

107859,A3TMC106MIY8S5,0790740281,A. Edward Azad,"[0, 1]","It might not be a great comedy, but the premise of this movie is ingenious.  A loser named Daniel (Albert Brooks) dies in a car crash and wakes up in purgatory, which turns out to be a mundane replica of earth called Judgment City.Daniel's sole ally is Bob Diamond (Rip Torn, best part of the movie), an amalgam of every sleazy defense attorney on the face of the earth.  He projects just the right amount of impersonal charm, making him the ideal friend to anybody in this situation;  I started wishing he was MY lawyer.  The highlights of DYL take place in the ""examining"" room, where Daniel is made to relive his miserable life while Bob Diamond dances around each catastrophe with a sunny outlook.As for the rest of it, the jokes go on for too long. Especially a running gag about how you can eat anything when you're dead and not gain weight (Brooks must have worried about his cholesterol at the time).  Daniel is really the only lifelike person in the film, with the rest of the world (dead and otherwise) full of condescending asses.  I also don't see why Meryl Streep instantly falls in love with this dork.  He plies her with jokes (which sometimes work in real life, I grant you) but Meryl acts like she's getting hot just staring at Albert Brooks. Which demands some level of suspension of belief.",4,thinkiness,1281312000,"08 9, 2010",2010,1309,"['might', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'comedy', 'premise', 'movie', 'ingenious', 'loser', 'named', 'Daniel', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'car', 'crash', 'up', 'purgatory', 'out', 'be', 'mundane', 'replica', 'earth', 'called', 'Judgment', 'City.Daniel', 'sole', 'ally', 'Bob', 'Diamond', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'amalgam', 'sleazy', 'defense', 'attorney', 'face', 'earth', 'projects', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'impersonal', 'charm', 'making', 'ideal', 'friend', 'anybody', 'situation', 'started', 'wishing', 'was', 'MY', 'lawyer', 'highlights', 'DYL', 'take', 'place', 'examining', 'room', 'where', 'Daniel', 'made', 'relive', 'miserable', 'life', 'Bob', 'Diamond', 'dances', 'catastrophe', 'sunny', 'outlook.As', 'rest', 'jokes', 'go', 'too', 'long', 'Especially', 'running', 'gag', 'how', 'can', 'eat', 'anything', 'when', ""'re"", 'dead', 'not', 'gain', 'weight', 'Brooks', 'must', 'have', 'worried', 'cholesterol', 'time', 'Daniel', 'really', 'only', 'lifelike', 'person', 'film', 'rest', 'world', 'dead', 'otherwise', 'full', 'condescending', 'asses', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'instantly', 'love', 'dork', 'jokes', 'sometimes', 'work', 'real', 'life', 'grant', 'Meryl', 'getting', 'hot', 'just', 'staring', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'Which', 'level', 'suspension', 'belief']",Defending Your Life VHS
107860,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,0790740281,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[67, 71]","Defending Your Life is one of the smartest, funniest, and original films to come out of the 1990s.  Albert Brooks, playing both behind and in front of the camera, does a fantastic job of creating this ""courtroom drama"" set in Purgatory.  By keeping a the films themes short and simple, enticing us with brilliant performances by Meryl Streep and Rip Torn, and bringing a true sense of fantasy to this picture, Brooks keeps us hooked from the opening scenes until the last.  Panned by most critics, I actually found this film to be extremely witty with a Wes Anderson-esque type of dry martini humor.  Brooks is easily able to transform himself into a likeable ""every man"" that finds himself defending his ""normal"" life.  What works is that it feels and seems like your own life.  Brooks' character isn't a superhero, he isn't a genius (only using 3% of his brain), and he isn't a playboy, he is your average human on the street.  Makes decent money, celebrates being alone, just bought a new BMW, and is coasting through life rather simply.  Sound like anyone you may know? Brooks creates this sensation that Judgment City could exist, that the trials of your life could happen, and within all of this chaos and confusion, love could emerge.Albert Brooks is a very smart writer.  He wouldn't create your typical Hollywood love story and send it through the recycling machine.  His approach to love in this film is totally random, somewhat sporadic, but yet honestly real.  There is a mystery between he and Meryl Streep's relationship.  That is what I loved so much about them.  Typically in films of this nature you have this elaborate story of how two people meet, they fall in love, they fight, and suddenly discover that their passion is stronger than ever before (normally due to some unforeseen ... or clich&eacute;d moment), but not in this film. Brooks approaches love as if it already exists.  He hints towards the notion that these two may have been in Judgment City before, that maybe they have already had their awkward courtship, that maybe the climactic clich&eacute; has already happened, and now they are just rediscovering themselves.  Brooks sets this up with Streep's first lines, which are simply, ""Haven't we met before?""  While this may not seem like it is that exciting, the fact that they are in Judgment City after dying, and two random people recognize each other is heartwarming.  I was immediately attached to these two characters from the moment they met in the Comedy Club.  Their emotions didn't seem created by Hollywood, but instead created by the brilliant craftsmanship of Brooks' words.  If you aren't connected to the courtroom antics of this film, than the spark that Streep creates with Brooks will surely keep you grounded for good.I would also like to applaud Brooks for his ability to create a whole new world from the inside out.  Just as confused as Brooks is when he first arrives to Judgment City, we are forced to see this creative world through his eyes, and he is not afraid to demonstrate his attention to detail.  The concept of food in this film kept me laughing long after the final credits rolled.  The scene in the Italian restaurant with the waiter and the pies ranks among one of the funniest scenes in a film.  In fact, as I type this review, I am still laughing about it.  His creative mind also allowed us to consider the possibility of reincarnation and the existence of bigger and better worlds.  He plants us in Judgment City, but doesn't leave us there.  He allows us to travel while making us feel comfortable, thus keeping a smile on our faces throughout the entire visit.  He makes us laugh, either through his own words, or through that of Rip Torn, who nearly stole every scene possible.  As I continue to watch more of Rip Torn's work, I am beginning to see that he is quite a versatile actor that has very deep comedic roots.  If it wasn't the instant connection between Streep and Brooks that kept this film glued together, than it definitely was the charisma of Rip Torn in the courtroom.Finally, I would like to say that watching this film in a post-Matrix universe, there are some interesting parallels between the two.  When Rip Torn is talking about allowing humans to go through to another life, or sending them back to Earth, he references the universe to a machine.  Again, living in a post-Matrix world, this immediately darkened the film and perked up my ears.  I know this may be grabbing at thin air, but the scene in the Matrix when Cypher is talking about how good the machine makes his steak taste, eerily reminded me of all the food used in this film.  There were several other moments just like this that just seemed to fit rather snug.  Whether you believe it or not, I believe the Wachowski brothers may have watched this film once or twice before creating their prized trilogy.Overall, I thought this was an outstanding film.  From the instant character excitement to the originality of the script, I thought that this was one of Brooks' best outings.  The fact that you could tell that the cast was honestly having a good time in every scene, that you laughed when they laughed (which was quite a bit in this film), and that you could actually enjoy a witty comedy without guns or violence impressed me.  Brooks has such a sharp humor that I cannot wait to revisit this movie to catch some of the lines that I may have missed the first time.  Streep does a sensational job, while Rip Torn steals every scene he is in.  Impressive to say the least, and am happy that the 90s were able to produce one original piece of comedy.Grade: ***** out of *****",5,Is this Heaven?,1126396800,"09 11, 2005",2005,5642,"['Defending',

Something my husband said one evening recently reminded me of the film, so I got it to share with him.  Although he enjoyed it as much as I had on first viewing, I felt that some of the humor was a little lame on seeing it again.  Streep was superb, of course, as the relaxed, carefree, and heroic Julia.  She leaps into the new experience of pleasure without consequences with a simple and delightful abandon, eating whatever food she likes and, as the end of her stay in Judgement City nears, propositioning the neurotic Daniel.  Albert Brooks is perfect as the latter, a fearful and self-defeating man who has missed the boat for his entire thirty odd years.  Although I think most people will enjoy the film on first viewing, I suspect that a repeat will find it much too predictable, perhaps even a little cliche.

Albert Brooks made some terrific films in the 80's like REAL LIFE and LOST IN AMERICA but this film from 1991 is his absolute best. The story begins with a man in his late 30's named Daniel Miller, (Albert Brooks), buying a brand new BMW and taking it for a drive while listening to some new CDs. The CDs drop off the seat next to him and while trying to pick them up Daniel drives straight into a bus. The next scene he's in the ""afterlife"" in a place called Judgement City. He is being driven to his hotel where he will spend the next week DEFENDING HIS LIFE. The premise for this film is that we are all here on earth to overcome our fears and when we pass on we must be judged on how well we have accomplished that. If we lose the judgement we will be returned to Earth. Daniel is a good guy but he did not exactly live a fearless life. Daniel starts his adventure in Judgement City by meeting his lawyer Bob Diamond played to perfection by Rip Torn. After his days in court Judgement City offers its visitors ""as much of the best food as they can eat without gaining weight"" and an array of nightly entertainment. While Daniel is at a comedy club he meets a woman his age named Julia, (Meryl Streep). She is a remarkable woman who seems to be a shoe in for getting to the next level of awareness. They begin to fall for each other while at the same time Daniel starts to realize that he may have a different fate than the heroic Julia.

107898,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0790740281,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 5]","Six years after piercing the yuppie delusion of the open road with his trenchantly funny ""Lost in America"", Albert Brooks went again behind and before the camera to make this amusing, soft-centered 1991 romantic fantasy involving one man's challenge in handling the afterlife. As with ""Lost in America"", Brooks casts himself as an LA-based advertising executive (a favorite calling of his for the satirical possibilities), but this time a very successful one named Daniel Miller. As he dives for some CDs in the spanking new BMW convertible he bought himself for his birthday, he crashes into a bus and dies. Before you can say heaven can wait, Daniel finds himself in a white tunic in a sterile-looking place called Judgment City. As he finds out, this is where he is to be placed on trial to find out if he moves on to heaven or has to return to earth.The rest of the film is focused on Daniel's trial, where he gets to witness select scenes from his life on a big screen, evidence used by both the defense lawyer and the prosecutor to support their respective cases. In the midst of the trial, he meets and falls in love with an idealized woman named Julia, the perfect candidate for heaven made clear by her innate goodness and shorter trial. His response to their romance leads to a nicely executed climax which tests Daniel's deep-seeded fears toward his inevitable fate. Although I miss the pervasive acerbity that I have come to expect from Brooks' comedy style, he achieves a winsome romanticism here and addresses pertinent questions about how fear holds us back from the things we really want.As Daniel, Brooks is a softer version of himself though just as self-critical, while a relaxed, accent-free Meryl Streep is ideally cast as the too-good-to-be-true Julia, whose only quirk is the bottomless appetite that the afterlife allows her. The two develop a nice rapport that makes the ending emotionally palpable. In welcome appearances, a likeable Rip Torn and a tough-minded Lee Grant play their roles as the battling lawyers with precision. Even Shirley MacLaine shows up in a cameo in a particularly funny scene set at the aptly named Past Lives Pavilion, where people can see their previous incarnations. This is an unexpectedly warm and fuzzy treat from a master of comedy sarcasm.

This movie is.Albert Brooks plays the lead character, Daniel Miller, a genial example of an everyday Joe and nobody who has a self-deprecating humor that matches his ambition and judgment. Even his purchase of a brand new BMW seems diminished, more so when he meets the front end of a bus with it.Daniel awakens to find he is on his way to Judgment City where his life will be closely examined in what appears to be very much of a trial, not for his sins, but for his lack of spine throughout his life. His defender, Bob Diamond played be Rip Torn, makes him feel small and insignificant even through his kindnesses. Lee Grant is the prosecutor who makes the argument before two judges that Daniel should be returned to earth. The transients in this ""half-way city"" await the decision if they will go to heaven or a return to earth to redeem themselves. There are golf courses, gourmet food, shopping malls and comedy clubs to occupy these white-robed  souls while their fate is being deliberated. He meets Julie played by Meryl Streep, who is intrigued by Daniel's wit in the club, where he goes toe-to-toe with the failing comedian.  Even with her, his feelings of inferiority and worthlessness surface as she is staying in an obviously upper class establishment while his digs look more like a Red Roof Inn. Ironically, it is Julie who brings Daniel to his ultimate challenge and his chance to redeem himself.The script is tailor-made for Brooks' delivery and character, probably because he directed this comedic fantasy. The plot and script never plods. Meryl Streep seems the perfect choice for the budding developing love interest as she and Brooks demonstrate a perfect chemistry. Rip Torn and Lee Grant provide the best in a supporting cast.  The music compliments plot and script.This is a light comedy that is a nice diversion from afternoon chores, dreary afternoons, or for just plain evening entertainment.Judge for yourself.",5,"""Judge"" for Yourself",1336176000,"05 5, 2012",2012,2037,"['What', 'good', 'do', 'dreary', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'nothing', 'watch', '100', 'channels', 'TV', 'movie', 'is.Albert', 'Brooks', 'lead', 'character', 'Daniel', 'Miller', 'genial', 'example', 'everyday', 'Joe', 'nobody', 'who', 'self-deprecating', 'humor', 'ambition', 'judgment', 'Even', 'purchase', 'brand', 'new', 'BMW', 'diminished', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'front', 'end', 'bus', 'it.Daniel', 'awakens', 'find', 'way', 'Judgment', 'City', 'where', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'closely', 'examined', 'what', 'be', 'very', 'much', 'trial', 'not', 'sins', 'lack', 'spine', 'life', 'defender', 'Bob', 'Diamond', 'played', 'be', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'feel', 'small', 'insignificant', 'even', 'kindnesses', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'prosecutor', 'who', 'argument', 'two', 'judges', 'Daniel', 'should', 'be', 'returned', 'earth', 'transients', 'half-way', 'city', 'await', 'decision', 'will', 'go', 'heaven', 'return', 'earth', 'redeem', 'are', 'golf', 'courses', 'gourmet', 'food', 'shopping', 'malls', 'comedy', 'clubs', 'occupy', 'white-robed', 'souls', 'fate', 'being', 'deliberated', 'Julie', 'played', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'who', 'intrigued', 'Daniel', 'wit', 'club', 'where', 'toe-to-toe', 'failing', 'comedian', 'Even', 'feelings', 'inferiority', 'worthlessness', 'surface', 'staying', 'obviously', 'upper', 'class', 'establishment', 'digs', 'look', 'more', 'Red', 'Roof', 'Inn', 'Ironically', 'Julie', 'who', 'Daniel', 'ultimate', 'challenge', 'chance', 'redeem', 'himself.The', 'script', 'tailor-made', 'Brooks', 'delivery', 'character', 'probably', 'directed', 'comedic', 'fantasy', 'plot', 'script', 'never', 'plods', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'perfect', 'choice', 'budding', 'developing', 'love', 'interest', 'Brooks', 'demonstrate', 'perfect', 'chemistry', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'provide', 'best', 'supporting', 'cast', 'music', 'compliments', 'plot', 'script.This', 'light', 'comedy', 'nice', 'diversion', 'afternoon', 'chores', 'dreary', 'afternoons', 'just', 'plain', 'evening', 'entertainment.Judge']",Defending Your Life VHS

107940,A2RHV42BTJSVON,0790740281,"Liolania ""In2Jesus""","[0, 0]","There are thousands of movies that deal with the after-life in some way, shape, or form.  Quite possibly, the most common, is the horror films of supernatural natures, but there are many other movies involving the afterlife in some way a very recent example is ""The Lovely Bones"", though that is a much more depressing movie, and not as well made either.I am not particularly a fan of Albert Brooks, some stuff he is in, I have enjoyed, others, I have not, but this movie has stuck with me since I first saw it at 6yrs, so I decided to watch it again and see if it was worth mentioning, and the good news is, it is!!!The way this film deals with the afterlife is not about religion, so as devout Christian I would say to other Christians: check your biases at the door. This movie is more of an allegory and commentary on humanity than it is about beliefs or morals.The story involves a man named Danielle (Albert Brooks) who is landed himself in the afterlife after a fateful meeting with a truck.  He discovers that he has been there many other times to be ""judged"" as to whether or not he has let go of the fears that so commonly plague mankind.  If it is found that he has let go of his fears, he moves stays, but if it is found that he still has fear ruling his life, he will be sent back to earth, reincarnated again.The great thing about this movie is that it touches on something that will never be dated; the nature of man to fear what he does not know or cannot control.  It does this in a very fun and touching manner as they go through various days (9 to be exact) in his life to see if he is ready to move on or not.  The humor is very dry and is not slapstick or silly, and though there are plenty of laugh-outloud moments that mainly come fro Rip Torn who plays Daniel's defense attorney, it is a more cerebral humor as it pokes fun at society's common fears.  The chemistry between Brooks and Streep is not incredible, but it is enough to make the movie believable, and the ending very satisfying and sweet, I even had tears in my eyes by the end.Overall, a wonderful movie, and a delight to anyone who enjoys intelligent comedies, and it is an underrated gem.  :)God Bless ~Amy",5,"Funny, Uplifting, and Poignant.",1278115200,"07 3, 2010",2010,2194,"['are', 'thousands', 'movies', 'deal', 'after-life', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'Quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'common', 'horror', 'films', 'supernatural', 'natures', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'involving', 'afterlife', 'way', 'very', 'recent', 'example', 'Lovely', 'Bones', 'much', 'more', 'depressing', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'made', 'either.I', 'am', 'not', 'particularly', 'fan', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'stuff', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'others', 'have', 'not', 'movie', 'stuck', 'first', 'saw', '6yrs', 'so', 'decided', 'watch', 'again', 'see', 'was', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'good', 'news', 'way', 'film', 'afterlife', 'not', 'religion', 'so', 'devout', 'Christian', 'would', 'say', 'other', 'Christians', 'check', 'biases', 'door', 'movie', 'more', 'allegory', 'commentary', 'humanity', 'beliefs', 'morals.The', 'story', 'man', 'named', 'Danielle', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'who', 'landed', 'afterlife', 'fateful', 'meeting', 'truck', 'been', 'there', 'many', 'other', 'times', 'be', 'judged', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'fears', 'so', 'commonly', 'plague', 'mankind', 'found', 'let', 'go', 'fears', 'stays', 'found', 'still', 'fear', 'ruling', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'sent', 'back', 'earth', 'reincarnated', 'again.The', 'great', 'thing', 'movie', 'something', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'dated', 'nature', 'man', 'fear', 'what', 'not', 'know', 'can', 'not', 'control', 'very', 'fun', 'touching', 'manner', 'go', 'various', 'days', '9', 'be', 'exact', 'life', 'see', 'ready', 'move', 'not', 'humor', 'very', 'dry', 'not', 'slapstick', 'silly', 'are', 'plenty', 'laugh-outloud', 'moments', 'mainly', 'come', 'fro', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'who', 'Daniel', 'defense', 'attorney', 'more', 'cerebral', 'humor', 'fun', 'society', 'common', 'fears', 'chemistry', 'Brooks', 'Streep', 'not', 'incredible', 'enough', 'make', 'movie', 'believable', 'ending', 'very', 'satisfying', 'sweet', 'even', 'had', 'tears', 'eyes', 'end.Overall', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'delight', 'anyone', 'who', 'intelligent', 'comedies', 'underrated', 'gem', 'God', 'Bless', '~Amy']",Defending Your Life VHS

107957,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0790740281,Reviewer,"[7, 7]","Writer, director and star Albert Brooks hits his stride to perfection in the out-of-this-world (literally) comedy ""Defending Your Life,"" which also stars Meryl Streep.  Daniel Miller (Brooks) has just celebrated his  birthday; on his way home from work, in a new car and with a stack of new  CD's (presents from co-workers), he becomes distracted, has a close  encounter with a bus, and does not survive.  The next thing he knows, he's  aboard a tram somewhere, en route to a place called ""Judgment City,"" which  has all the amenities of a resort, and has the best food he's ever had,  ever (and you can eat as much as you want, and never gain weight).  He's  put up in a fine hotel, and a phone call later he is in the office of Bob  Diamond (Rip Torn), who he learns is to be his defense counselor in a trial  during which his entire life is to be judged.  Did he make the most of his  life?  Make the right decisions?  Was he able to conquer his fears, or did  he always take the easy way because he was afraid?  The decision of the two  Judges (George Wallace and Lillian Lehman) who will hear his case will  determine his future.  Will he have to ""Go back,"" and try it all again in  another life on earth, or will he be deemed ready to ""Move on.""  Brooks  has created a tableau of colorful, memorable characters here, surrounding  Daniel Miller as we follow his progress from one hilarious scene to the  next.  As Julia, a fellow defendant whom Daniel meets and falls in love  with, Meryl Streep is an absolute joy to watch.  Lee Grant, as Lena Foster,  Daniel's prosecutor, is also in top form.  But Rip Torn, as the exuberant  Bob Diamond, is the one who practically steals the show, with a performance  that should have garnered him a best supporting actor nomination.  The  scene in which Diamond explains to Daniel that the average person on earth  only uses three percent of available brain capacity (he calls them ""Little  brains"") is hysterical.  Other memorable scenes involve a visit by Daniel  and Julia to the ""Past Lives Pavilion,"" wherein they encounter a number of  surprises, and one in which they are having dinner, and Daniel is  embarrassed by a waiter who wants to give him ""nine pies"" to take home, and  by Julia, who digs into a plate of pasta with gusto and sucks in the  longest noodle, apparently, in all of Judgment City, and all while Lena  Foster looks on from another table across the room; all of which adds up to  plenty of laughs.  The supporting cast also includes Art Frankel  (Arthur), Ernie Brown (Ernie), Gary Beach (Car salesman), Peter Schuck  (Stan), Sharlie Stuart, and Buck Henry, doing an especially funny turn as  Dick Stanley, a defense counselor who fills in for Bob Diamond one day, and  who doesn't like to ""toot his own horn.""  ""Defending Your Life"" is a witty,  imaginative conjuring by Brooks, who uses his magic formula to deliver a  classic comedy that you will want to watch over and over again.

Waking up dead in the perpetually sunny and 74-degree Judgment City, Daniel discovers that he must ""defend"" the life he lived on Earth - a process which consists of reviewing selected days from his life to determine the extent to which he overcame fear and lived genuinely as a result. If he is found by the two judge panel to have sufficiently conquered fear, he is allowed to pass on to a higher plane, if not he will return to Earth to try again. He is assigned a Defender (played with amiable bluster by Rip Torn) and must argue against a steely Prosecutor (Lee Grant). During the course of his stay in Judgment City, Daniel meets and falls in love with Julia (the lovely Meryl Streep), another recently deceased arrival. Without revealing too much more, it is sufficient to say that the love Daniel develops for Julia is crucial to the outcome of his ""trial"".This movie was a delight to watch! The humor ranges from wry observation about the human condition to pop culture sight gags such as Shirley Maclaine hosting the Past Lives Pavilion (a Judgment City attraction in which visitors can glimpse their past life incarnations). The philosophy of the film, the idea that fear is a crucial element to be worked through while we are here, resonated deeply with me. It is fear in one form or another, after all, which prevents us from leading genuine lives - the fear of death or the fear of defying Societal Will (""the Dragon of Thou Shalt"", to quote Joseph Campbell) and being truly ourselves, for example.""Defending Your Life"" is the perfect antidote to the flood of moronic comedies that have been so popular of late, a movie that will make you laugh and, perhaps, think.",5,A comedy for big brains,1012089600,"01 27, 2002",2002,1950,"['Released', '1991', 'Defending', 'Life', 'one', 'rare', 'movies', 'once', 'funny', 'intelligent', 'yes', 'profound.Writer', 'director', 'star', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'Daniel', 'Miller', 'advertising', 'executive', 'who', 'driving', 'headlong', 'bus', 'birthday', 'Waking', 'up', 'dead', 'perpetually', 'sunny', '74-degree', 'Judgment', 'City', 'Daniel', 'must', 'defend', 'life', 'lived', 'Earth', 'process', 'reviewing', 'selected', 'days', 'life', 'determine', 'extent', 'overcame', 'fear', 'lived', 'genuinely', 'result', 'found', 'two', 'judge', 'panel', 'have', 'sufficiently', 'conquered', 'fear', 'allowed', 'pass', 'higher', 'plane', 'not', 'will', 'return', 'Earth', 'try', 'again', 'assigned', 'Defender', 'played', 'amiable', 'bluster', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'must', 'argue', 'steely', 'Prosecutor', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'course', 'stay', 'Judgment', 'City', 'Daniel', 'meets', 'falls', 'love', 'Julia', 'lovely', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'recently', 'deceased', 'arrival', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'sufficient', 'say', 'love', 'Daniel', 'Julia', 'crucial', 'outcome', 'trial', '.This', 'movie', 'was', 'delight', 'watch', 'humor', 'wry', 'observation', 'human', 'condition', 'pop', 'culture', 'sight', 'gags', 'such', 'Shirley', 'Maclaine', 'hosting', 'Past', 'Pavilion', 'Judgment', 'City', 'attraction', 'visitors', 'can', 'glimpse', 'past', 'life', 'incarnations', 'philosophy', 'film', 'idea', 'fear', 'crucial', 'element', 'be', 'worked', 'are', 'here', 'resonated', 'deeply', 'fear', 'one', 'form', 'leading', 'genuine', 'lives', 'fear', 'death', 'fear', 'defying', 'Societal', 'Will', 'Dragon', 'Thou', 'Shalt', 'quote', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'being', 'truly', 'ourselves', 'example', 'Defending', 'Life', 'perfect', 'antidote', 'flood', 'moronic', 'comedies', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'popular', 'late', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'perhaps', 'think']",Defending Your Life VHS

Brooks, who manages to look uneasy and neurotic while wearing heavenly robes, almost certainly seems doomed to another round on the third planet.Yet Streep and Brooks seem somehow made for each other.  Can he beat the system and keep his new love?  Or will separate reincarnations on different worlds keep them apart forever?&quot;Defending Your Life&quot; is a delightfully heretical comedy, with a gentle touch of blasphemy and many honest laughs.  It's Albert Brooks' best movie since &quot;Broadcast News,&quot; and he hasn't done anything as good since.A wonderful date movie -- just make sure you both have some Kleenex.",5,Smart &amp; Spiritual Comedy,1031270400,"09 6, 2002",2002,1065,"['Albert', 'Brooks', 'dead', 'Merryl', 'Streep', 'Can', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'together', 'anyway', 'temporary', 'afterlife', 'where', 'elite', 'group', 'brains', 'led', 'hysterically', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'decide', 'fate.If', 'conquered', 'fears', 'life', 'Earth', 'get', 'promoted', 'next', 'life', 'better', 'world', 'did', ""n't"", 'then', 'back', 'horrible', 'little', 'Earth', 'you.Streep', 'perfection', 'white', 'will', 'be', 'moving', 'Brooks', 'who', 'look', 'uneasy', 'neurotic', 'wearing', 'heavenly', 'robes', 'almost', 'certainly', 'doomed', 'round', 'third', 'planet.Yet', 'Streep', 'Brooks', 'seem', 'somehow', 'made', 'other', 'Can', 'beat', 'system', 'keep', 'new', 'love', 'will', 'separate', 'reincarnations', 'different', 'worlds', 'keep', 'apart', 'forever', 'quot', 'Defending', 'Your', 'Life', 'quot', 'delightfully', 'heretical', 'comedy', 'gentle', 'touch', 'blasphemy', 'many', 'honest', 'laughs', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'best', 'movie', 'quot', 'Broadcast', 'News', 'quot', ""n't"", 'done', 'anything', 'good', 'since.A', 'wonderful', 'date', 'movie', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'have', 'Kleenex']",Defending Your Life VHS

I was lucky to come across in a store the last DVD that contain both ""Meet Joe Black"" and ""Death Takes a Holiday"" on a second disc.  ""Meet Joe Black"" was also presented in DTS 5.1 Surround Sound.  I never had seen ""Death Takes a Holiday"" before and so when I watch it after seeing ""Meet Joe Black"" I was surprise by the beauty of it.  I usually don't enjoy films dating back to 1934 but this is very good.I hope someday that Universal will re-release these two movies together again on DVD.  I recommend at this time to buy the VHS version of  ""Death Takes a Holiday"" so you can enjoy the movie.""Defending Your Life is funny but it does make you set back and start to wonder.

107973,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,0790740281,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[9, 36]","I've been hearing about what a terrific cult film this is so I had to see it.  It's actually a very conventional boy-meets-girl flick, the only difference being this time it happens in the afterlife.  Brooks' depiction of the ""holding area"" we go to after our demise, while we re waiting to see if we qualify for heaven, is amusing, but once there he does little with his premise except 1) have Brooks fall instantly in love with Meryl Streep (not hard to do, actually) and 2) sit through his worst moments of cowardice, which he has to defend with the help of his lawyer, played by Rip Torn, against a prosecutor, Lee Grant, who makes Marcia Clarke look like Miss Congeniality.The two problems I have with this movie are 1) the romance is unconvincing.  We never really see a moment of connection between the two--it's just instant love and ""I've never met anyone like you"" when they barely know each other, and it's more of a plot device than real character development.  And 2) the film's ultimate message is muddled.  At first the film seems to say those in the afterlife have it over us because of their superior intelligence--they use ""more than 50% of their brains.""  They call us ""little brains"" and they delight in our inability to comprehend things that to them are so simple.But when Brooks' character's trial begins, it centers on his not taking risks, not his intellectual inferiority.  But risk-taking is inherently opposed to intelligent, rational, considered decision-making, which has at its core self-preservation and calculation instead of impulsiveness and immediate gratification.  Thus it's hard to fault Brooks for what he does and doesn't do--here was the opportunity for some real moral dilemmas, but instead the film shows such minor transgressions that we should all hope our lives are so clean.  (And this is a man whose career was advertising!  Lots of opportunities here, all unused by Brooks.)  On the other hand, Meryl Streep's character does well with the ""big brains"" in her trial.  In one scene from her extraordianry life, Meryl rushing back into her burning house, after having saved her two children, to rescue the family cat.  But I would argue that risking making your kids orphans just to save Fluffy is very *un*inteligent behavior.  Have you ever heard a fire fighter praise a mother for leaving her kids at the curbside to go back in and get the cat?  This is what pleases our keepers above?  They're not very good keepers in that case.The same is true of Brooks' final act: is running in front of a bunch of speeding busses something someone who uses more than 50% of his brain would do?  After all, this is how he got killed to begin with.Many readers will think I'm being overly-analytical for a comedy, but in a comedy of ideas the ideas have to work.  Even a ""brain dead"" comedy like Bad Santa was *consistent* in its outlook.The performances are rather bland.  Albert Brooks is standard issue Albert Brooks, but even here I miss the more manic qualities he displays in many of his other films (Lost In America, Modern Romance, Broadcast News).  This seems to be a ""softer"" Brooks, and it gets boring.  Streep does the best she can with a really paper-thin role.  We never get why she connects so strongly with Brooks after exchaning a few banalities with him, and if I were him I'd fear she were interested in me only because everyone else is over 70.  Rip Torn does his typical comic stuff, but we never really get into why he's so laid back about providing a defense for Brooks, and there's a bit in the middle where he disappears for a day that is never really explained, since Brooks' defense doesn't go any differently with Torn's substitute (Buck Henry).  The best person in the picture may well be Lee Grant, who attacks her role with zest and is credible as a tough-as-nails prosecutor ""just doing her job.""Can't recommend this flick very highly, unless you're an Albert Brooks completist who must see every film he is involved with.",2,"Clever concept, lightweight film",1096934400,"10 5, 2004",2004,3991,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'hearing', 'what', 'terrific', 'cult', 'film', 'so', 'had', 'see', 'actually', 'very', 'conventional', 'boy-meets-girl', 'flick', 'only', 'difference', 'being', 'time', 'afterlife', 'Brooks', 'depiction', 'holding', 'area', 'go', 'demise', 're', 'waiting', 'see', 'qualify', 'heaven', 'amusing', 'once', 'little', 'premise', '1', 'have', 'Brooks', 'fall', 'instantly', 'love', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'not', 'hard', 'do', 'actually', '2', 'sit', 'worst', 'moments', 'cowardice', 'defend', 'help', 'lawyer', 'played', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'prosecutor', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'who', 'Marcia', 'Clarke', 'look', 'Miss', 'Congeniality.The', 'two', 'problems', 'have', 'movie', 'are', '1', 'romance', 'unconvincing', 'never', 'really', 'see', 'moment', 'connection', 'two', 'just', 'instant', 'love', ""'ve"", 'never', 'met', 'anyone', 'when', 'barely', 'know', 'other', 'more', 'plot', 'device', 'real', 'character', 'development', '2', 'film', 'ultimate', 'message', 'muddled', 'first', 'film', 'say', 'afterlife', 'have', 'over', 'superior', 'intelligence', 'use', 'more', '50', '%', 'brains', 'call', 'little', 'brains', 'delight', 'inability', 'comprehend', 'things', 'are', 'so', 'simple.But', 'when', 'Brooks', 'character', 'trial', 'not', 'taking', 'risks', 'not', 'intellectual', 'inferiority', 'risk-taking', 'inherently', 'opposed', 'intelligent', 'rational', 'considered', 'decision-making', 'core', 'self-preservation', 'calculation', 'instead', 'impulsiveness', 'immediate', 'gratification', 'Thus', 'hard', 'fault', 'Brooks', 'what', ""n't"", 'do', 'here', 'was', 'opportunity', 'real', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'instead', 'film', 'shows', 'such', 'minor', 'transgressions', 'should', 'hope', 'lives', 'are', 'so', 'clean', 'man', 'career', 'was', 'advertising', 'Lots', 'opportunities', 'here', 'unused', 'Brooks', 'other', 'hand', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'character', 'well', 'big', 'brains', 'trial', 'one', 'scene', 'extraordianry', 'life', 'Meryl', 'rushing', 'back', 'burning', 'house', 'having', 'saved', 'two', 'children', 'rescue', 'family', 'cat', 'would', 'argue', 'risking', 'making', 'kids', 'orphans', 'just', 'save', 'Fluffy', 'very', '*un*inteligent', 'behavior', 'Have', 'ever', 'heard', 'fire', 'fighter', 'praise', 'mother', 'leaving', 'kids', 'curbside', 'go', 'back', 'get', 'cat', 'what', 'keepers', ""'re"", 'not', 'very', 'good', 'keepers', 'case.The', 'same', 'true', 'Brooks', 'final', 'act', 'running', 'front', 'bunch', 'speeding', 'busses', 'something', 'someone', 'who', 'more', '50', '%', 'brain', 'would', 'do', 'how', 'got', 'killed', 'begin', 'with.Many', 'readers', 'will', 'think', ""'m"", 'being', 'overly-analytical', 'comedy', 'comedy', 'ideas', 'ideas', 'have', 'work', 'Even', 'brain', 'dead', 'comedy', 'Bad', 'Santa', 'was', '*consistent*', 'outlook.The', 'performances', 'are', 'rather', 'bland', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'standard', 'issue', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'even', 'here', 'miss', 'more', 'manic', 'qualities', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'Lost', 'America', 'Modern', 'Romance', 'Broadcast', 'News', 'be', 'softer', 'Brooks', 'boring', 'Streep', 'best', 'can', 'really', 'paper-thin', 'role', 'never', 'get', 'why', 'so', 'strongly', 'Brooks', 'exchaning', 'few', 'banalities', 'were', ""'d"", 'fear', 'were', 'interested', 'only', 'everyone', 'else', '70', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'typical', 'comic', 'stuff', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'why', 'so', 'laid', 'back', 'providing', 'defense', 'Brooks', 'bit', 'middle', 'where', 'day', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'Brooks', 'defense', ""n't"", 'go', 'differently', 'Torn', 'substitute', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'best', 'person', 'picture', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'who', 'role', 'zest', 'credible', 'tough-as-nails', 'prosecutor', 'just', 'doing', 'job', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'flick', 'very', 'highly', ""'re"", 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'completist', 'who', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'involved']",Defending Your Life VHS
