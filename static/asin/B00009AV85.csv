I did have a few grievences with the show.  First was the editing.  One show would end and it felt like a month has passed in the show.  The episode's were not connected very well, with a few exceptions, like great mini-series usually are.  Another grievence is how the show ended.  Everything seemed hurried, like the producer's suddenly realized that only 20 minutes of show was left and they needed a sudden conclusion.  The show did not tell what happened to side characters, like the doctor or the DEA agent, the script just left them in the dust. If you like the Godfather Part 1, you will realize that the ending of this show is a rip-off of the ending of a classic.  I would recommend watching this, but just don't expect too much.",3,"Good story, bad production",1077753600,"02 26, 2004",2004,889,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'three', 'DVD', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'were', 'good', 'performances', 'script', 'wase', ""n't"", 'bad', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'did', 'have', 'few', 'grievences', 'show', 'First', 'was', 'editing', 'One', 'show', 'would', 'end', 'felt', 'month', 'passed', 'show', 'episode', 'were', 'not', 'connected', 'very', 'well', 'few', 'exceptions', 'great', 'mini-series', 'usually', 'are', 'grievence', 'how', 'show', 'ended', 'Everything', 'seemed', 'hurried', 'producer', 'suddenly', 'realized', 'only', '20', 'minutes', 'show', 'was', 'left', 'needed', 'sudden', 'conclusion', 'show', 'did', 'not', 'tell', 'what', 'happened', 'side', 'characters', 'doctor', 'DEA', 'agent', 'script', 'just', 'left', 'dust', 'like', 'Godfather', 'Part', '1', 'will', 'realize', 'ending', 'show', 'rip-off', 'ending', 'classic', 'would', 'recommend', 'watching', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much']",Kingpin

Visually stunning with great sets and production values Kingpin certainly looks great. The story is another matter.Scarface minus The Godfather plus American Family then mix thoroughly with network standards and practices and you really have a mess. This story cries truly for more sex and violence.The acting is a mixed bag with Yancey Arias giving a great performance as the head guy. Sheryl Lee chewing scenery as his shrewish Anglo wife and most embarrassingly Brian Benben hopelessly miscast as an indebted mule/plastic surgeon. Yep it is Nip/Tuck meets The Shield without the grittiness of either as well as a lot of unsubtitled Spanish to wade through.After you watch the first twenty minutes you will say to yourself hey this is really cool.

753388,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00009AV85,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","Miguel Cadena (Yancy Aria) is a young American educated Mexican in the employ of one of the biggest drug runners in the country. This mini-series tells his story not only directly through his eyes, but through the lived of those his business touches as well.When the drug lord goes insane and finds a price on his head, Miquel and his brother take matters into their own hands. Seeing the time is ripe to make their move, they take out their boss and attempt to maneuver themselves into his role. Just to insure things, they take out his son, the next in line as well.But their plan gets twisted when the boss' brother comes out of retirement for the time being to run things. Even with him in charge, the pair make moves to increase not only their business, but their power as well.As all of this goes one, we are also brought into the family life of Miguel. His wife (Sheryl Lee) is a high powered attorney who helps him in many of the decisions he must make. The pair is the doting parents of a young son, a boy they insure knows nothing of their lifestyle or business ventures.As members of the organization move to take over and win their place at the table, Miguel must maneuver his way around them as often as he does the law. He does so with a smooth style, an ease, a coolness that reveals him to be more deadly an adversary than most would give him credit for.Other plot lines? How about the plastic surgeon going through a nasty divorce who wants to divest himself from dealing drugs? All he needs to do is dispense with his last shipment and pay off what he owes. This leads to a hip hop record producer who uses the load to finance his dreams of making the big time. And he in turn connects with a DEA agent on the skids with the department after having lost a partner and being wounded by a drug dealer.....who works for Miguel. See how nicely these pieces all come together?The story is believable and fascinating to watch. It's like seeing the strategies of a chess game made plain and understandable, feeling compelled to watch until the next move is played, and then waiting for the next and the next and the next. Which leaves you feeling a void once the show is over because it doesn't actually end! This was a series on NBC for a while that never seemed to draw in the ratings it deserved. Now we'll have to wait and see if they actually finish the story!The last time this topic was given any intriguing attention was in the book by James Mills THE UNDERGROUND EMPIRE, which told the story of three individuals involved in the drug trade and where it took them. This show captures that feeling of being a part of the story and going behind the scenes. It makes for interesting viewing and dynamite television. Had it been given a chance to find it's core audience on a cable station, this show would have rivaled THE SOPRANOS for best crime family drama.",4,SOUTH OF THE  BORDER SOPRANOS,1205539200,"03 15, 2008",2008,2876,"['Miguel', 'Cadena', 'Yancy', 'Aria', 'young', 'American', 'educated', 'Mexican', 'employ', 'one', 'biggest', 'drug', 'runners', 'country', 'mini-series', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'directly', 'eyes', 'lived', 'business', 'touches', 'drug', 'lord', 'insane', 'price', 'head', 'Miquel', 'brother', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'Seeing', 'time', 'ripe', 'make', 'move', 'take', 'out', 'boss', 'attempt', 'maneuver', 'role', 'Just', 'insure', 'things', 'take', 'out', 'son', 'next', 'line', 'well.But', 'plan', 'twisted', 'when', 'boss', 'brother', 'retirement', 'time', 'being', 'run', 'things', 'Even', 'charge', 'pair', 'make', 'moves', 'increase', 'not', 'only', 'business', 'power', 'well.As', 'one', 'are', 'also', 'brought', 'family', 'life', 'Miguel', 'wife', 'Sheryl', 'Lee', 'high', 'powered', 'attorney', 'who', 'many', 'decisions', 'must', 'make', 'pair', 'doting', 'parents', 'young', 'son', 'boy', 'insure', 'nothing', 'lifestyle', 'business', 'ventures.As', 'members', 'organization', 'move', 'take', 'over', 'win', 'place', 'table', 'Miguel', 'must', 'maneuver', 'way', 'around', 'as', 'often', 'law', 'so', 'smooth', 'style', 'ease', 'coolness', 'be', 'more', 'deadly', 'adversary', 'most', 'would', 'give', 'credit', 'for.Other', 'plot', 'lines', 'How', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'going', 'nasty', 'divorce', 'who', 'divest', 'dealing', 'drugs', 'do', 'dispense', 'last', 'shipment', 'pay', 'off', 'what', 'hip', 'hop', 'record', 'producer', 'who', 'load', 'finance', 'dreams', 'making', 'big', 'time', 'turn', 'connects', 'DEA', 'agent', 'skids', 'department', 'having', 'lost', 'partner', 'being', 'wounded', 'drug', 'dealer', '..who', 'Miguel', 'See', 'how', 'nicely', 'pieces', 'come', 'together', 'story', 'believable', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'seeing', 'strategies', 'chess', 'game', 'made', 'plain', 'understandable', 'feeling', 'compelled', 'watch', 'next', 'move', 'played', 'then', 'waiting', 'next', 'next', 'next', 'Which', 'feeling', 'void', 'show', ""n't"", 'actually', 'end', 'was', 'series', 'NBC', 'while', 'never', 'seemed', 'draw', 'ratings', 'deserved', 'Now', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'see', 'actually', 'finish', 'story', 'last', 'time', 'topic', 'was', 'given', 'intriguing', 'attention', 'was', 'book', 'James', 'Mills', 'THE', 'UNDERGROUND', 'EMPIRE', 'told', 'story', 'three', 'individuals', 'involved', 'drug', 'trade', 'where', 'took', 'show', 'feeling', 'being', 'part', 'story', 'going', 'scenes', 'interesting', 'viewing', 'dynamite', 'television', 'Had', 'been', 'given', 'chance', 'find', 'core', 'audience', 'cable', 'station', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'rivaled', 'THE', 'SOPRANOS', 'best', 'crime', 'family', 'drama']",Kingpin

753392,A1MIFU0YKLG40T,B00009AV85,Rick Galati,"[32, 32]","This 6 episode (3 disk) series was made for and recently aired on network television, but in my opinion was quite successful in narrowing the distinction between traditional TV fare and far more graphic projects usually associated with pay cable offerings. It is the saga of a fabulously wealthy Mexican crime family presiding over a global drug cartel, and the 6 episodes define how the power of that family was violently consolidated under the quiet and cunning leadership of Miguel Cadena,(Yancey Arias). Much of what was done has been done before and inevitable comparisons to ""The Godfather"" are sure to be raised. But with a mostly Hispanic cast, cultural values usually associated as south of the border, and highly imaginative plot twists, this work is sometimes brilliant. The production values of this series more closely resemble that of film rather than episodic weekly television.
