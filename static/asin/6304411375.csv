How Frank got talked into this farce would make good coversation over a drink or two.  If he was trying to follow up for SERGEANTS THREE, or 4 FOR TEXAS, he missed the bullseye.However, if you have free time of a few hours to spare, and if like me have never seen this film before, then you might want to watch it.  I remember when they were filming it from some outtakes shown back then, but had never seen this one in theatres or on cable.  Thanks to Encore Westerns I have finally been able to view the film, albeit 38 years later with most actors in the film now dead and buried.I read many westerns and enjoy western movies so I don't find this movie as objectionable as some may.  I also enjoy the work of many of the actors in the film, so overall I give it a medium rating of 3 stars.  At certain points in the film I did laugh aloud, and while it will never become my favorite film, it is worth viewing.  Certainly Frank left us with some much better films, but I'll bet ole blue eyes had a 'gas' making this 'ring a ding, ding', one.Semper Fi.",3,NOT MUCH HAPPENING . . .,1220918400,"09 9, 2008",2008,1114,"['Not', 'much', 'happening', 'psuedo', 'comedy', 'western', '1970', 'How', 'Frank', 'got', 'talked', 'farce', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'coversation', 'drink', 'two', 'was', 'trying', 'follow', 'up', 'SERGEANTS', 'THREE', '4', 'FOR', 'TEXAS', 'missed', 'bullseye.However', 'have', 'free', 'time', 'few', 'hours', 'spare', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'watch', 'remember', 'when', 'were', 'filming', 'outtakes', 'shown', 'back', 'then', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'one', 'theatres', 'cable', 'Thanks', 'Encore', 'Westerns', 'have', 'finally', 'been', 'able', 'view', 'film', '38', 'years', 'later', 'most', 'actors', 'film', 'now', 'dead', 'buried.I', 'read', 'many', 'westerns', 'enjoy', 'western', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'movie', 'as', 'objectionable', 'may', 'also', 'enjoy', 'work', 'many', 'actors', 'film', 'overall', 'give', 'medium', 'rating', '3', 'stars', 'certain', 'points', 'film', 'did', 'laugh', 'aloud', 'will', 'never', 'become', 'favorite', 'film', 'worth', 'viewing', 'Certainly', 'Frank', 'left', 'much', 'better', 'films', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'ole', 'blue', 'eyes', 'had', ""'gas"", 'making', ""'ring"", 'ding', 'ding', 'Fi']",Dirty Dingus Magee VHS
