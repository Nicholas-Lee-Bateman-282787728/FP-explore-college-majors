Texas high school football is the secondary story as far as I am concerned.

The story and character development is striking and will draw you in. I streamed the show on my Kindle and once I started watching it was like eating potato chips....one night I looked at the clock and it was 3:00am.

I was in the middle of the first episode of the first season and I said to myself, I'm watching magic unfold on tv. This show I recommend to anyone who loves drama. Be prepared to feel the chills on your arms and the tears in your eyes. This show has everything from a loving grandmother with dementia who is cared for by her grandson to racial tension and drug use. You have simple teenage angst to teenage pregnancy and rape. But let me clarify about the rape. There are no scenes, only a man is wanted for the acts of rape and a major character or two get wrapped up in that mess.As a husband and father I have learned a lot from the writing of this show. Watching Kyle Chandler as Eric Taylor is amazing to me. I mean this when I say it. I have never had another actor get my attention like he has done. His facial expressions speak volumes. Its funny actually. When he gets angry, look at his face. You know what he is thinking.I could literally go on and on about each and every character on this show. I am serious, not a bad actor in the bunch. I mean from the every now and again appearances to the main stays the acting is real. You can feel the pain. and the triumph by the way. I am pleased to see this show wrap up character arcs that end satisfyingly well. Jason Street comes to mind.I would say this to anyone who comes across this show and is not sure...This show entertains at the highest level. But it also can teach you a thing or two. I have picked up on better ways to approach my children and wife. I find myself trying to be as patient as Landry or Tim or Coach Taylor because I know I would like to attain to be at that level of maturity. This show's story thrives on real life and the lessons learned from living. But even if you are are still not sure...You don't have to like football to watch this show.

A simple feel good drama about football and down to earth folks of a small town in Texas called Dillon.What I experienced instead? A very deep and moving television series that happens to use football as a backdrop as it delves into so many issues of life. Basically it turned into a lesson in ontology, an exploration of our humanity as crazy as that may sound.Honestly I had no idea that the show was going to stretch so many characters the way they did. What you may see initially seems like standard fare typical characters, two dimensional so to speak. A loud and cocky star running back, a former player who is a successful business man but still lives vicariously through the team as a top booster etc etc. So many of the characters in this show get challenged and tested in ways that any person who breathes a breath can relate to.During my first viewing of the series I constantly thought to myself, ""I love Friday Night Lights.""

Well, I guess I haven't seen enough TV to compare it to the whole history, but others who have agree.  It certainly has the most honest moments of any drama around these days.  It is based on a book, a true story about the 1950s Odessa, Texas  high school football team, the Panthers.  It was first made into a (bad) movie.  The television series is set in 21st century mythic Dillon, Texas, and, though the town is obsessed with the football team, the series includes other aspects of Texas culture. Coach Taylor and his wife (the school counselor and later principal) are a model couple.  They don't hide their flaws or the problems they run into; they face them head-on, together.  They  are the stabilizing force that helps everyone get better.  All the characters are likable, flawed, hopeful, real individuals.

This show is riveting and it will be hard to stop at the end of any episode, even for sleep or work! I won't go into the storyline and the acting (Kyle Chandler is an old favorite of mine and he plays a football coach perfectly!) because so many have done that. I will talk to parents though, who are wondering if they should watch this with their kids, because we are always looking for something on Netflix streaming that has lots of episodes, that we can watch as a family.My boys are 15 and 11 currently. I watched many of the first episodes/seasons with my oldest. My youngest is not interested in shows that are a lot of talking and a lot of football....yet. ;0)  While Friday Night Lights caught and kept our attention, there were quite a lot of things that I think parents should be aware of before their own children become hooked on this program. I'll list them:Lots and lots of 'making out' scenes, very drawn out undressing and sex scenes with no nudity but as close as you can get without putting this on HBO.The girls wear the tightest clothing, only the cutest (?) outfits, no acne, oversized tees or grunge here. They are all very skinny, perfect hair, makeup, and clearly way over 18 in real life.This is supposed to be HIGH SCHOOL and there are teens drinking from a little to a whole lot in many episodes, right from the beginning. I was pretty sure that the drinking age in all of the USA is 21, but clearly in the town these kids live in, it's 16. There is no mention of how illegal it is to drink beer etc...this topic (as I recall) is never dealt with..ever. It's really weird, actually. I think the writers just dropped that 'law' altogether to suit the writing, sexual encounters, etc etcThere are strip club scenes. Wow. One of the main characters' sister works at a strip club. I will admit I have trouble with a show that supposedly is written for/about families with teens as the entire focus, then you tune in to see the opening scene of a very up-close of strippers on poles, dancing in a dark club... clearly an attempt to keep men watching. As a matter-of-fact, just about anything that pertains to women (who are supposed to be teen girls) is written and acted out in a way that is hopefully going to keep grown men watching.Drug issues, absent parents, abusive homes...honestly all of these things are not dealt with in a way that I find helpful as a parent. But then, as long as you are not watching this show for anything but the wonderful acting, the magnetic storyline and the awesome Kyle Chandler, you will be fine.As I mentioned earlier, this review is to be helpful to parents who monitor what their kids watch, and/or don't want to be surprised by a show that seems like it's all about hometown pride, football and getting through the teen years in a believable way.  I loved this show (up to the stripper stories etc where it really jumped the shark imo) and do highly recommend it.

While the dramatic media coverage and recruitment was not really part of my town, many, many of the scenes in Season 1 and 2 could have been filmed at my high school and in my town. My favorite season is the fourth; least favorite is the second.The pros:1. The capturing of emotion and high school sports; the kids' performance on the field is directly impacted by their private lives.2. The paralysis story line. The emotions of the team, the families, and of course, the player hurt all done extremely well.3. The acting. Top notch throughout.4. Morality. There are constant musings on what is right or wrong and often times there isn't a clear action, which is very realistic to the world we all live in; decisions have consequences.5. Closure. Season 5 was a perfect closure for the various story lines established in Seasons 1-4.The cons:1. Stereotypes. It's never good to brush a group of people with broad strokes. I'm curious what Southerners would think about some of the messages this series sends regarding lifestyle, race relations, and relationships in the South.2. The camera angles, especially in Season 2. Very unnecessary to keep zooming in and out, and it does become distracting. They fixed this by Season 4.3. The first 5 or 6 episodes of Season 2. I almost stopped watching. If you are thinking of it too, don't. It gets much better. Season 1 was so addicting that I assumed Season 2 would be the same. But the first half of it, including the death plot (huh?) and the lack of Coach Taylor really took away from the flow. It was the only portion of the series I felt they made Tami weak, and it wasn't good.The bottom line: The only other TV series I ran through this quickly was Friends back in the late 90s / early 00s. I was pleasantly surprised by this series, and mostly not for the football aspect of it. Rather it was the accuracy in conveying personal relationships and emotions that grabbed me from the pilot.

Wilcoxon,"[6, 7]","I watched the first season of Friday Night Lights and stopped following it when it was airing on TV at some point only to find the it again during the final season and I couldn't remember why I ever stopped watching.  Well I remember now.  This is an honest review of the good and the bad...Spoilers below!!!!Season 1 - By far the best season of the show. The first season set the stage by introducing us to the small Texas town of Dillon where football rules everything.  The players are worshipped by both towns people and classmates.  The show centers around the new head coach, his family, and the players and their friends and families trying to navigate this culture, changing relationships, and finding the right path in their life.  Some of the major stories center around the star qb being paralyzed and his recovery and the effect it has on everyone; the lifetime back-up qb being forced into the starting role and the impact that has on him and his friendships, the coach trying to keep his job with back-up players, etc. The first season is excellent and if I was just rating that season it would be 5 stars without a doubt.Season 2 - Following the best season of the show is the by far the worst season.  The show lost its way the second season.  I understand there were some unforeseen challenges such as the writers strike that cut off 7 planned episodes and the show was endanger of being cancelled so when the strike was over they didn't finish the season out...but that doesn't excuse the horrible plot lines...this show was about the issues facing a high school football team in an obsessed town...not some secret murder and cover up plot that is so unrealistic it detracts from everything around it; there was no explanitions for the sudden shift in Julie (the coaches daughter) from a fairly good and responsible kid to a complete brat that I wanted to see get a beating in about every scene she was in, and that doesn't even get into the story lines that just disappeared - the story of a juvenile delinquent who moves in with top booster Buddy and he encourages/pushes him to play football - he is suddenly gone and never mentioned again, even the story of Street's pregnant girlfriend making a decision about if she will keep the baby isn't addressed again until the 4th episode of the next season...the show really lost its direction this season and sadly I would rate the season at 2 stars at best probably more likely 1 star.Season 3 finds it's way again and leaves behind murder stories in favor of the realistic character driven story lines the show does well.  Characters also return to who they are and are developed even more.  We finally see more about the coach's wife career desires and the she has more of an identity than just the coaches wife.  Matt gets demoted from starting qb as a new freshman with a great arm shows up.  And while the story gets back to more solid story lines it still wants us to forget what we know from other seasons as they try to force story lines that just don't quite make sense on us...for example, coach Taylor kicked Riggins off the team for skipping practice to go to Mexico with Street and he has to go through a lot to get back on the team so this season Riggins takes off to NYC with Street and nothing happens when he gets back.  The biggest example of this though is the wedding episode where Billy Riggins marries Mindy...why is every main character at the wedding especially when they have detailed how poor both families are?  Tim, Lila, Landry, and Tara obviously would be there but why Matt and Julie?  Julie is Tara's friend not Mindy's.  And in what world is ok for Matt to leave to bring his grandmother to the reception? The coach never coached Billy and Mindy's mother didn't like Mrs. Taylor so why are they there?  But the most obvious problem was that Buddy was there - the same Buddy who had an affair with Mindy's mother, tried to buy her off making her feel so cheap she attacked him in public costing Buddy his family - in no universe would he ever be invited or show up.  I would rate the season as a 3.In Season 4, Coach Taylor is back to the drawing board.  He has been ousted from the Dillon Panthers and is in a new school building a team from scratch.  This brings in even more new characters and new situation.  There are only 2 negatives to this season.  First, JD (the strong arm qb from last season on the Panthers) got the same treatment Julie got in Season 2 - last season he was quiet, did everything his father said and most of the story line surrounded his teammates trying to get him out of his shell.  This season suddenly JD is a complete punk and spoiled brat...if they played him as a spoiled brat last season and just made him more aggressive or built his character more but this is a complete reversal.  The second problem as the show seems scared to let go of some of the old characters.  Matt graduated was set to go to Chicago but decided to stay - I guess his story makes a little sense since he is still dating Julie but what about Tim Riggins?  His entire story this season just feels like ""we have this guy under contract let's find something to do with him every episode.""  Despite those problems this season is the best since the first season.  It is a solid 4 stars.The final season continues to follow coach Taylor and his family. It also focus on the new players we met last season...I just finished watching the final episode and can't get it out of my mind.  Often when a great season ends either they don't know it is the last season and can't wrap things up or the ending just doesn't match what we expect and hope for.  Friday Night Lights did not have either of those problems!  It end perfectly.  A great conclusion to a great show.  This season was another solid 4.Overall Friday Night Lights may have stumbled along the way...but it is a very good series.",4,Good Series but had missteps along the way,1359158400,"01 26,
