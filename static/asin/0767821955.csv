Dedicated to raising his daughter while her mother spends her days on crack, Lucky's ambition to transcend the limitations of life in the hood compels him to spend weekends in Oakland in his cousin's eight-track garage studio, recording rap songs that enable him to creatively voice his inner rage and build hope for his future.

PJ had 2 basic problems:1) The plot went all over the place, and in the end, went almost nowhere. Many things were left unresolved, many things started and then went nowhere, too many sub-stories, many things that should've been covered weren't.2) The acting was either average or overdone. Regina King, who's usually so great, chewed scenery almost constantly. Tupac's role was OK; he did much better in other films. Most of this one he was trying to be too brooding or too deep, and it didn't work. Janet was 100% average. There was nothing about her role or acting that was beyond mediocre. 100 other actresses could've done just as well or even better. Her character just wasn't believeable. That's blatantly obvious to anyone who watches the film objectively. And Joe Torry, while he's a surprisingly competent actor, couldn't get past the one-dimensionaltity of his character.

People don't think she was good in this because the real Janet is just too sweet and quiet for this role, but it was a great opportunity for her to break out her shyness. At times, she sounded like Kim Fields and Halle Berry. I love the poems she had spoken throughout the entire movie. ""Phenomenal Woman"" is my favorite. She looked very beautiful and her body was just incredibly gorgeous to look at. One of my all time favorite lines would have to be ""If Am A B***, then your mama is a b***, B***!"". I could totally feel the anger and frustration of a woman who has been through so much in her life. Her first boyfriend being murdered, her mother committing suicide, and the loss of her beloved grandmother leaving her all alone in this world. Also, the punanny joke was funny too. Okay, enough about my lovely Janet. 2Pac did a great job playing his role. He can be funny at times. I enjoyed Regina King's character as well...even she sounded really harsh and trifling at times.

16853,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767821955,,"[0, 2]","In the 90's it was quite common to have hip-hop stars try and teach us life lessons about the struggle of the streets in below average films that were embraced by a community because of the allure of the stars.  The novelty of watching a Jackson become an actress or seeing your beloved deceived rapper in the film that made him more than just a rapper was (and for some,  still is) too much of a good thing to pass up.  At the end of the day though, most of those offerings were just that, below average.  The fact that the majority of those stars couldn't act their way out of a paper bag was also a sad reality.  Sure, you had a select few who excelled in front of the camera (Ice Cube still has an acting career for a reason) but they were few and far in-between.I'm still not sure what has helped Janet Jackson maintain relevance outside of her family name, but apparently her star refuses to fade even though it's been dim for quite some time.`Poetic Justice' came out when I was eight and was a huge hit with my older sisters who thought Tupac was hot and listened to Janet Jackson repeatedly.  Having recently (well, it's been a few years but recent enough) seen `Boyz in the Hood' and really enjoyed it, I was anxious to see what Singleton did with his follow up effort.  The fact that my sisters (those with such little taste) enjoyed this didn't really matter to me.  Sadly, this is a hot mess of a film that misses every opportunity and is layered with horrid acting, hokey development and cluttered plot points.I want to address the claims that Singleton intended to have the film cluttered to depict the reality of life and how many things happen at one time and life continues, or whatever.  I'm sorry, but having a lot going on only works if you give us validation for those depictions.  `Poetic Justice' doesn't do that.  Instead it throws everything at us in random segments and then drops them in the next moment to move onto something else.  It tries to address alcoholism and abuse for two solitary scenes and then we never hear about it again.  In fact, both moments are so random, with nothing to precede them or back them up, that they feel forced and unnecessary.  That's a major issue here.  The film feels unnecessary.More than all that though, the acting is a major sore spot.  Janet Jackson is an atrocious actress.  She hasn't improved with age either, she's just developed different bad habits.  Here she completely loses the character in her efforts to `portray something'.  She reads blank and tries too hard to emote something natural that she comes across uncomfortable.  Tupac is better, but not by much.  Regina King starts off as something special and then the haphazard script reduces her to a plot point and makes a mockery of her performance.This is just a mess, but at least the Oscar nominated song is still wonderful!",1,"I'll never watch this hot mess again (but I still listen to the song, `Again')...",1373414400,"07 10, 2013",2013,2861,"['90', 'was', 'quite', 'common', 'have', 'hip-hop', 'stars', 'try', 'teach', 'life', 'lessons', 'struggle', 'streets', 'below', 'average', 'films', 'were', 'embraced', 'community', 'allure', 'stars', 'novelty', 'watching', 'Jackson', 'become', 'actress', 'seeing', 'beloved', 'deceived', 'rapper', 'film', 'made', 'more', 'just', 'rapper', 'was', 'still', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'thing', 'pass', 'up', 'end', 'day', 'most', 'offerings', 'were', 'just', 'average', 'fact', 'majority', 'stars', 'could', ""n't"", 'act', 'way', 'paper', 'bag', 'was', 'also', 'sad', 'reality', 'Sure', 'had', 'select', 'few', 'who', 'excelled', 'front', 'camera', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'still', 'acting', 'career', 'reason', 'were', 'few', 'far', 'in-between.I', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'helped', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'maintain', 'relevance', 'family', 'name', 'apparently', 'star', 'fade', 'even', 'been', 'dim', 'quite', 'time.', 'Poetic', 'Justice', 'came', 'when', 'was', 'eight', 'was', 'huge', 'hit', 'older', 'sisters', 'who', 'thought', 'Tupac', 'was', 'hot', 'listened', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'repeatedly', 'Having', 'recently', 'well', 'been', 'few', 'years', 'recent', 'enough', 'seen', 'Boyz', 'Hood', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'anxious', 'see', 'what', 'Singleton', 'did', 'follow', 'up', 'effort', 'fact', 'sisters', 'such', 'little', 'taste', 'enjoyed', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'Sadly', 'hot', 'mess', 'film', 'opportunity', 'layered', 'horrid', 'acting', 'hokey', 'development', 'cluttered', 'plot', 'points.I', 'want', 'address', 'claims', 'Singleton', 'intended', 'have', 'film', 'cluttered', 'depict', 'reality', 'life', 'how', 'many', 'things', 'happen', 'one', 'time', 'life', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'having', 'lot', 'going', 'only', 'give', 'validation', 'depictions', 'Poetic', 'Justice', ""n't"", 'do', 'Instead', 'everything', 'random', 'segments', 'then', 'drops', 'next', 'moment', 'move', 'something', 'else', 'address', 'alcoholism', 'abuse', 'two', 'solitary', 'scenes', 'then', 'never', 'hear', 'again', 'fact', 'moments', 'are', 'so', 'random', 'nothing', 'precede', 'back', 'up', 'feel', 'forced', 'unnecessary', 'major', 'issue', 'here', 'film', 'feels', 'acting', 'major', 'sore', 'spot', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'atrocious', 'actress', ""n't"", 'improved', 'age', 'just', 'developed', 'different', 'bad', 'habits', 'Here', 'completely', 'character', 'efforts', 'portray', 'something', 'blank', 'tries', 'too', 'hard', 'emote', 'something', 'natural', 'uncomfortable', 'Tupac', 'better', 'not', 'much', 'Regina', 'King', 'off', 'something', 'special', 'then', 'haphazard', 'script', 'plot', 'point', 'mockery', 'performance.This', 'just', 'mess', 'least', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'song', 'still', 'wonderful']",N/A

I am going to be blatantly honest with everyone because it's only fair.""Poetic Justice"" is not a movie that just anyone would enjoy.  It is more suited for someone who is familiar with urban street life.  A lot of people would be disgusted with this movie because of the profanity and violence.  John Singleton did a nice job with writing the movie, keeping in mind that this is his second movie endeavor.  I agree with the reviewers who stated that he tried to put too many situations in one movie, but I don't think he left anything out.""Poetic Justice"" is a motion picture about a young hairdresser from California named Justice (THE BEAUTIFUL JANET JACKSON) who has lost her mother, boyfriend and grandmother, and she feels somewhat alone in the world.  In fact, John puts into the viewers mind that the only person she really has is her best friend, Iesha (Regina King).  In the beginning of the movie Justice has just lost her boyfriend and is obviously very bitter about that.  She seems to take the anger out on Lucky (2 Pac).  Lucky likes Justice but she is still not over her late boyfriend.  Lucky and Iesha's boyfriend, Chicago (Joe Torry) have to take a trip to drop some packages off because they are mail men.  Chicago asks Iesha to come along and to bring a friend, so she brings Justice.  While on their way to drop off the packages, Lucky tries to have conversations with Justice, but she is really hurt about the loss of the boyfriend, so she is in no mood for talking.  She is very bitchy towards Lucky and he gets mad and they begin to argue throughout the movie until they discover that they have much in common.  As stated, there are other situations in the movie that hang by the waist side.When one is acting, it should not be visible that he or she is acting.  The actor is supposed to make you believe that you are that person.  Janet obviously did her best, but she just is not believable.  She's supposed to be a ""ghetto girl"", but anyone could easily see right through her.  Maybe it wasn't the best role for her, or maybe she just didn't have enough real life experience.

(For the record, this has got to be one of the most profanity-laced films I've ever seen) Janet Jackson more or less does a competent job with her performance, and Tupac stands out as well, but the real deal is Regina King, who sparkles and adds sass in every scene she's in.  Her scene during which she curses out her sexually impotent boyfriend is a real-eye opener.  Otherwise, this movie lacks focus and a reason to care for the characters and their predictaments.  It seemed like Singleton just filmed a random collection of great scenes and one-liners and left it at that.  So my verdict is this: see it for Regina King.

People saw the previews to this movie back in '93 and saw Tupac's name and said, ""Bet! Gang movie!"" That's not what it was...but it wasn't a good movie either.The title of this movie is actually a play-on-words about Janet's character (she plays a poet named Justice). The plot is really all over the place. It ranges from Justice leaving college to become a hairdresser to her kicking ghetto flava to Lucky (Tupac Shakur), a postal worker she never liked in the first place. After a while Lucky invites Justice, her best friend Iesha (Regina King), and Iesha's man-of-the moment Chicago (Joe Torry) on an overnight delivery run. An overnight postal delivery run. That sounds like a great road trip, doesn't it?Chicago starts fighting (literally) with Iesha and Justice, which makes Lucky pull over and leave him stranded. When they finally reach the destination, Lucky is informed that tragedy strikes his family, and he ends up blaming Justice for it.I'm not gonna give this movie props just because it's a John Singleton movie. There were so many problems with it. First of all, why did Lucky blame Justice for his problems? Second, Justice seemed to be arguing with everyone in the movie, and none of the arguments had anything to do with anything (especially when she breaks up the fight between Iesha and Chicago). Speaking of that, a guy named Chicago? What was Singleton thinking?The most important question everyone should ask themselves is, Was Janet Jackson even convincing in her role as Justice?

Of course the script could've been tighter and the climax stronger and more rewarding, thus resulting in a more worthwhile film. However, in the film's defense, the charismatic Tupac shines while convincingly helming the sole well-conceived role. He's the best reason -- perhaps the only reason -- viewers should join in on the film's road trip to Oakland. He's subtle but confident, forceful but not heavy-handed, complex but genuine -- all the things that have also made him a legendary (and sorely missed) rapper. On the other hand, regarding Ms. Jackson... Well, I'll attempt to simply and kindly take the high road and say she probably shouldn't attempt to act again (unless she takes some drama classes). Janet simply doesn't get it. She doesn't understand the craft. She ""acts"" throughout the entire movie, something a skilled and experienced performer would never be caught doing. Perhaps Singleton was just too smitten with her to inform her that performing requires more than just emoting and script recitation. I understand that fans of Janet's music will invariably take issue with my comments, but if they'd simply separate her on-screen skills from her (heavily studio-enhanced) musical skills, I believe they'd have to agree with me. And it doesn't help that Janet's character (Justice) isn't a well-written, fully-developed and focused role; that's Singleton's fault -- not Janet's. Also, in the movie, fans of Maya Angelou will enjoy her cameo and the verses she wrote for Janet's character, a poet. And the fan(s) of Regina King will appreciate the challenging, range-revealing character stretch she takes on: she portrays a sassy, shallow, one-dimensional young lady with an attitude (that's something we've never seen her play before). Overall, Poetic Justice isn't one of Sigleton's finest moments, but again, revisiting Tupac's performance makes it entertaining and somewhat worthwhile.",2,"Not Singleton's Finest Moment, But Still Worth Watching",1184112000,"07 11, 2007",2007,2000,"['clear', 'what', 'Singleton', 'attempted', 'do', 'one', ""'d"", 'say', 'was', 'noble', 'effort', 'course', 'script', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'tighter', 'climax', 'stronger', 'more', 'rewarding', 'thus', 'resulting', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'However', 'film', 'defense', 'charismatic', 'Tupac', 'shines', 'convincingly', 'helming', 'sole', 'well-conceived', 'role', 'best', 'reason', 'perhaps', 'only', 'reason', 'viewers', 'should', 'join', 'film', 'road', 'trip', 'Oakland', 'subtle', 'confident', 'forceful', 'not', 'heavy-handed', 'complex', 'genuine', 'things', 'have', 'also', 'made', 'legendary', 'sorely', 'missed', 'rapper', 'other', 'hand', 'regarding', 'Ms.', 'Jackson', 'Well', ""'ll"", 'attempt', 'simply', 'kindly', 'take', 'high', 'road', 'say', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'act', 'again', 'drama', 'classes', 'Janet', 'simply', ""n't"", 'get', ""n't"", 'understand', 'craft', 'acts', 'entire', 'movie', 'something', 'skilled', 'experienced', 'performer', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'caught', 'doing', 'Perhaps', 'Singleton', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'smitten', 'inform', 'performing', 'more', 'just', 'emoting', 'script', 'recitation', 'understand', 'fans', 'Janet', 'music', 'will', 'invariably', 'take', 'issue', 'comments', ""'d"", 'simply', 'separate', 'on-screen', 'skills', 'heavily', 'studio-enhanced', 'musical', 'skills', 'believe', ""'d"", 'have', 'agree', ""n't"", 'help', 'Janet', 'character', 'Justice', ""n't"", 'well-written', 'fully-developed', 'focused', 'role', 'Singleton', 'fault', 'not', 'Janet', 'Also', 'movie', 'fans', 'Maya', 'Angelou', 'will', 'enjoy', 'cameo', 'verses', 'wrote', 'Janet', 'character', 'poet', 'fan', 's', 'Regina', 'King', 'will', 'appreciate', 'challenging', 'range-revealing', 'character', 'stretch', 'sassy', 'shallow', 'one-dimensional', 'young', 'lady', 'attitude', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'play', 'Overall', 'Poetic', 'Justice', ""n't"", 'one', 'Sigleton', 'finest', 'moments', 'again', 'revisiting', 'Tupac', 'performance', 'entertaining', 'somewhat', 'worthwhile']",N/A

He  stepped away from the easy ghetto flick and goes for something softer but yet deeper. The film is good but it wasn't that great due to it's flaws. When I was younger I thought it was great but now seeing it again I don't know what I was thinking. The overuse of swearing may be necessary and realistic but it is overdone here and spoils many scenes - he could have toned it down a bit and kept realism. Also the plot is very broken down - we have a trip that never seems to get dark but has too much in it for just one day surely? Also each stop is supposed to show us another aspect of `the black experience' other than the protagonist's ghetto existence. However this doesn't work as it makes the film feel aimless and episodic.The main failing is sadly, my girl Janet. Her infamous smile and corn-rows and floppy hats couldn't really save her,  On the other hand it's not her fault - the poems are those of a more mature woman (Angelou - who plays Aunt June) and it just didn't fit her. The clearest example of this is watching her stare into space, rubbing her chest as she `writes' `Phenomenal Woman'. But also she is really poor - she doesn't have the range to make the character believable and the rest of this falls as a result. Continuing the musical theme Tupac is a talent sadly missed. He shines here and, although the swearing etc isn't hard for him he does the more emotional stuff much, much better than Jackson. I can't sing his praises enough - for me he made this watch able. Other musicians include Tone Loc and Q-Tip.....was this some sort of label push? Regina King is poor - her constant talking like a Jerry Springer guest etc is really tiresome and her `partner' Torry is just as bad - whose idea was it to have he constantly brushing his hair for no reason? Was it the only way we would get that he's vain?I will give credit to Singleton for trying. I especially liked the way he brings the `black urban experience' into contrast with the white idea of cities in movies in the first 5 minutes. We open with shots of a lit up and pretty cityscape of LA with Gerswin-esque music playing a la Woody Allen's Manhattan. However this image of how Allen views his city is revealed to be a movie in a drive through in Compton - this, he's saying, is the black reality. A very clever start I thought (hands up for Billy Zane and Lori Petty for agreeing to be in yet another bad movie - even if it's a fake one!)Other than that, I feel it was a brave step for Singleton.

She lost her alcoholic mother to suicide at the age of 12 and the recent gang-related murder of her boyfriend has spiraled the young woman into a deep depression. She only wears black, is in a constant state of morose with a touch of sarcasm, and expresses herself through her poetry (written by Maya Angelou who appears as a critical, gossipy aunt in a brief scene). However, a road trip to a hair show in Oakland with a postal worker named Lucky (Tupac Shakur) forces Justice out of her loneliness and despair.It makes me laugh when people get all new about Janet's acting career. She was an actress before she was a singer. Hello, lil' Penny from Good Times? Charlene on Diff'rent Strokes? Her performance in Poetic Justice is convincing and moving and I'm not just saying that because she's my girl. There were many moments where I forgot that she was Janet Jackson the superstar and instead saw Justice, the wistful, angry woman covering her pain with a gum smacking tough exterior. One scene in particular always gets me of her sitting in front of a mirror making different facial expressions before breaking down into tears while Stevie Wonder's I Never Dreamed You'd Leave in Summer plays in the background. How eerie is it that Stevie himself would sing that very song at Michael's memorial service 16 years later?The late Tupac's performance is beyond words and much ""softer"" (for lack of a better word) than the thuggish image found in his music and public persona. Lucky is a young father doing right by his little girl by looking for a way out of the projects (his druggie ex-girlfriend is absolutely no help). However, he can be just as angry and disrespectful as Justice. It's sweet to watch their transformation from sworn enemies to learning how much alike they are, then opening their hearts and growing closer to each other.Tagging along are Regina King (best known for her roles in the 80's sitcom 227 and TNT's cop drama Southland) as Justice's self-absorbed, but loveable best friend Iesha and Joe Torry is her boyfriend Chicago, a fool more in love with himself than her. Him and that stupid hairbrush!There was alot of controversy surrounding the graphic language at the time of Justice's release (mostly because the public had a hard time accepting curse words coming out of ""little Janet""'s mouth). That aspect of the film didn't bother me, because it adds to the realism of inner city life. If you can't handle it then you might want to skip it. Another criticism is that this film is as raw as Singleton's acclaimed Boyz In the Hood, but it's not supposed to be.

However , I feel the need to defend it , from most of these other reviews.Therefore , I will explain two important points. 1) Alot of people dislike this film for the dialog. The film is based on people who are frustrated with the directions of their lives and the deterioration of their envioronment ( aka:hood ). The profanity might be abundant in the script , but it was coming from characters who vented their frustrations, that way.Not everyone in the hood cusses. But John Singleton's characters, do. Nobody protested Martin Scorcese's Goodfellas. I'm sure not every Italian cusses. 2) Alot of people say that there's too many things going on , in the movie. John Singleton said , in the commentary , that he deliberately , filmed that way. He was trying to cappture the realism of everyday life and exemplify the fact that things are still happening , irregardless of the problems of our central characters. Personally , I think John Singleton, did a phenominal job of juggling other delimas, from the side characters, without sacrificing the importance, of the dynamics between Justice and Lucky. Another director would've totally blown the task , altogether. As for the dvd , it offers a director's commentary ( which some reviewers , obviously didn't watch ) and previews of other Singleton, films. The film's theme is simple : Love can conquer all. All acting performances are excellent and the soundtrack is good ( old and new school , atleast in '93 ). * The featured cameo appearances, of Mayu Angelo, The Last Poets,and the dedicated acting from Tupac Shakur and Regina King, cement ""Poetic Justice"",into a significant and unforgettable film.",4,Un-Poetic misinterpretations !!,1112572800,"04 4, 2005",2005,1776,"['Originally', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'write', 'online', 'review', 'film', 'Mainly', 'came', 'out', 'decade', 'ago', 'However', 'feel', 'need', 'defend', 'most', 'other', 'reviews.Therefore', 'will', 'explain', 'two', 'important', 'points', '1', 'Alot', 'people', 'dislike', 'film', 'dialog', 'film', 'based', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'frustrated', 'directions', 'lives', 'deterioration', 'envioronment', 'aka', 'hood', 'profanity', 'might', 'be', 'abundant', 'script', 'was', 'coming', 'characters', 'who', 'vented', 'frustrations', 'way.Not', 'everyone', 'hood', 'cusses', 'John', 'Singleton', 'characters', 'do', 'Nobody', 'protested', 'Martin', 'Scorcese', 'Goodfellas', ""'m"", 'sure', 'not', 'Italian', 'cusses', '2', 'Alot', 'people', 'say', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'going', 'movie', 'John', 'Singleton', 'said', 'commentary', 'deliberately', 'filmed', 'way', 'was', 'trying', 'cappture', 'realism', 'everyday', 'life', 'exemplify', 'fact', 'things', 'are', 'still', 'happening', 'irregardless', 'problems', 'central', 'characters', 'Personally', 'think', 'John', 'Singleton', 'did', 'phenominal', 'job', 'juggling', 'other', 'delimas', 'side', 'characters', 'sacrificing', 'importance', 'dynamics', 'Justice', 'Lucky', 'director', 'would', ""'ve"", 'totally', 'blown', 'task', 'altogether', 'dvd', 'director', 'commentary', 'reviewers', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'previews', 'other', 'Singleton', 'films', 'film', 'theme', 'simple', 'Love', 'can', 'conquer', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'good', 'old', 'new', 'school', 'atleast', ""'93"", '*', 'featured', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'Mayu', 'Angelo', 'Last', 'Poets', 'dedicated', 'acting', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'Regina', 'King', 'cement', 'Poetic', 'Justice', 'significant', 'unforgettable', 'film']",N/A
