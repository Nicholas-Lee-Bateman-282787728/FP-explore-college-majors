1208627,A384HKZ76NHTLS,B001KQS3WU,"Andrew P. Valenti ""thedetours""","[5, 8]","The title ""Towelhead"" enticed me into watching this utterly vacuous bit of film-making because it stirred my imagination. Finally, I thought, a film about the disenfranchising of the Arab-American community during the first Gulf War. All the elements were there, a Lebanese teenager of mixed heritage assimilating into a classic middle-America Texas community, the iconic neo-conservative neighbor, the stereotypical strict Lebanese father, the mean-spiritedness of the school community, etc.This could've been an innovative, creative work exploring themes of prejudice, patriotism, and assimilation in the ferment of the Iraq war era.  Unfortunately, from the film's beginning, it became clear that the focus would be on the precocious, budding sexual tension of the 13-year old protagonist (played convincingly by an 18-year old actress so as to give the film makers the legal cover to show the actress in a variety of demeaning, mean-spirited, and unhealthy situations.It's not as if the sexual awakening of a pre-pubescent girl has not been explored before with much more artistic success (think Lolita, And God Created Woman, or American Beauty).  Why was this film made? Certainly, it's not as nuanced as the novel of the same name.  It's not particularly well-directed, photographed, or acted. It doesn't have a sophisticated perspective on race-relations, as the characters' actions are less motivated by race than by sexual tension and ignorance. Perhaps the film's producers sensed an opportunity to exploit the curiosity inherent in watching a 13-year old girl being raped by a middle-aged man. I dunno.In comparison, a beautiful film that explores race-relations, assimilation, as well as the awakening desires of the protagonist's daughter, see Mira Nair's ""Mississippi Masala"". It's a far more uplifting and edifying film than ""Towelhead"" and is well-written, wonderfully acted, and beautifully shot. It proves that you CAN explore timeless themes without devolving into exploitation.It's seems that in film-making all things are permitted. This has been a way to extend the art. However, as Towelhead amply demonstrates, not all things are beneficial.",2,"""Towelhead"" Needs a Wash",1266278400,"02 16, 2010",2010,2166,"['title', 'Towelhead', 'enticed', 'watching', 'utterly', 'vacuous', 'bit', 'film-making', 'stirred', 'imagination', 'Finally', 'thought', 'film', 'disenfranchising', 'Arab-American', 'community', 'first', 'Gulf', 'War', 'elements', 'were', 'there', 'Lebanese', 'teenager', 'mixed', 'heritage', 'assimilating', 'classic', 'middle-America', 'Texas', 'community', 'iconic', 'neo-conservative', 'neighbor', 'stereotypical', 'strict', 'Lebanese', 'father', 'mean-spiritedness', 'school', 'community', 'etc.This', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'innovative', 'creative', 'work', 'exploring', 'themes', 'prejudice', 'patriotism', 'assimilation', 'ferment', 'Iraq', 'war', 'era', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'beginning', 'became', 'clear', 'focus', 'would', 'be', 'precocious', 'budding', 'sexual', 'tension', '13-year', 'old', 'protagonist', 'played', 'convincingly', '18-year', 'old', 'actress', 'so', 'give', 'film', 'makers', 'legal', 'cover', 'show', 'actress', 'variety', 'demeaning', 'mean-spirited', 'unhealthy', 'situations.It', 'not', 'sexual', 'awakening', 'pre-pubescent', 'girl', 'not', 'been', 'explored', 'much', 'more', 'artistic', 'success', 'think', 'Lolita', 'God', 'Created', 'Woman', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Why', 'was', 'film', 'made', 'Certainly', 'not', 'as', 'nuanced', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'not', 'particularly', 'well-directed', 'photographed', 'acted', ""n't"", 'have', 'sophisticated', 'perspective', 'race-relations', 'characters', 'actions', 'are', 'less', 'motivated', 'race', 'sexual', 'tension', 'ignorance', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'producers', 'sensed', 'opportunity', 'exploit', 'curiosity', 'inherent', 'watching', '13-year', 'old', 'girl', 'being', 'raped', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'dunno.In', 'comparison', 'beautiful', 'film', 'race-relations', 'assimilation', 'as', 'well', 'awakening', 'desires', 'protagonist', 'daughter', 'see', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'Mississippi', 'Masala', 'far', 'more', 'uplifting', 'edifying', 'film', 'Towelhead', 'well-written', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'CAN', 'explore', 'timeless', 'themes', 'devolving', 'exploitation.It', 'film-making', 'things', 'are', 'permitted', 'been', 'way', 'extend', 'art', 'However', 'Towelhead', 'amply', 'demonstrates', 'not', 'things', 'are', 'beneficial']",N/A
1208628,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B001KQS3WU,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[0, 1]","***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***Fear of being politically incorrect has never been a problem in Hollywood. Just look at things likeReligulousand you'll see a good example of that. Hollywood also isn't afraid to show the bitter side of being human. Things likeCrashshowed our prejudices, both inside government and in the home. So it comes as no surprise that these predecessors have spring-boarded such successes as this film, TOWELHEAD.The big difference here, I guess, is that the title itself gives away some of -- if not all of -- the film's intent. It's also a graphic title, depicting a rather hated racial slur. But still, it stands out as a b@llsy way to get a message across using one effective word. But, apparently, distributors didn't like it, so if you're looking for this film to purchase or rent, you'll have to look it up under its new, more politically appealing title, NOTHING IS PRIVATE (talk about a lame!). But I'm going to stick with Towelhead because a) I like being politically volatile, and b) the original title is appropriate for the film's machinations.The story is about Jasira Maroun (Summer Bishil), the sexually awakening daughter of divorced parents in America. Part white on her mother's side (Maria Bello,A History of Violence) and part Lebanese on her father's (Peter Macdissi,Six Feet Under), Jasira is a nearly fully developed young woman while being only 13 years old. This doesn't escape the attention of a macho, and much older, neighbor named Travis (Aaron Eckhart,The Dark Knight) who begins prowling after her even though he's married and at least 20 years her senior ...and it's illegal.Towelhead is rife with prejudice ...and rightfully so. It shows us not just anglo prejudices against other races, but brown against black, brown against redneck whites, and black against white. It also traces the problems many nationalities have growing up in a culture far removed from their roots. This is seen in Jasira's father when he must learn how to handle his daughter who's sexual appetite he can't begin to understand, and dealing with his own needs as a man when he finds solace in the arms of an American woman while leaving Jasira to fend for herself.Unfortunately I did have a problem with the minimal incorporation of another neighbor played by Toni Collette (Little Miss Sunshine). She takes a keen interest in Jasira and even becomes -- out of the blue -- a mother figure that Jasira seems to need very badly. But this section was so rushed that it was forced onto the viewer.I must also strike a note of caution for those who are uncomfortable with certain unseemly aspects of society; particularly those who don't like child abuse or pedophilia. This film holds back nothing (and I mean N-O-T-H-I-N-G!). From a young girl's loss of her hymen by an adult to interracial, underage, sexual experimentation Towelhead really goes the distance in showing us the darker side of a world we'd rather leave behind closed doors. But opening them can open our eyes and reveal our own misunderstandings surrounding prejudices and our neighbors next door.A movie well worth renting and seeing ...if you can handle it.",4,"Towelhead Is The Correct Title, Not The Stupid New One Being Touted: Nothing Is Private",1235779200,"02 28, 2009",2009,3149,"['***MAY', 'CONTAIN', 'SPOILERS***Fear', 'being', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'never', 'been', 'problem', 'Hollywood', 'Just', 'look', 'things', 'likeReligulousand', ""'ll"", 'see', 'good', 'example', 'Hollywood', 'also', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'show', 'bitter', 'side', 'being', 'human', 'Things', 'likeCrashshowed', 'prejudices', 'inside', 'government', 'home', 'surprise', 'predecessors', 'have', 'spring-boarded', 'such', 'successes', 'film', 'TOWELHEAD.The', 'big', 'difference', 'here', 'guess', 'title', 'away', 'not', 'film', 'intent', 'also', 'graphic', 'title', 'depicting', 'rather', 'hated', 'racial', 'slur', 'still', 'out', 'b', '@', 'llsy', 'way', 'get', 'message', 'using', 'one', 'effective', 'word', 'apparently', 'distributors', 'did', ""n't"", 'so', ""'re"", 'looking', 'film', 'purchase', 'rent', ""'ll"", 'have', 'look', 'up', 'new', 'more', 'politically', 'appealing', 'title', 'NOTHING', 'IS', 'PRIVATE', 'talk', 'lame', ""'m"", 'going', 'stick', 'Towelhead', 'like', 'being', 'politically', 'volatile', 'b', 'original', 'title', 'appropriate', 'film', 'machinations.The', 'story', 'Jasira', 'Maroun', 'Summer', 'Bishil', 'sexually', 'awakening', 'daughter', 'divorced', 'parents', 'America', 'Part', 'white', 'mother', 'side', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'part', 'Lebanese', 'father', 'Peter', 'Macdissi', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Jasira', 'nearly', 'fully', 'developed', 'young', 'woman', 'being', 'only', '13', 'years', 'old', ""n't"", 'escape', 'attention', 'macho', 'much', 'older', 'neighbor', 'named', 'Travis', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'who', 'prowling', 'even', 'married', 'least', '20', 'years', 'senior', 'illegal.Towelhead', 'rife', 'prejudice', 'rightfully', 'so', 'not', 'just', 'anglo', 'prejudices', 'other', 'races', 'brown', 'black', 'brown', 'redneck', 'whites', 'black', 'white', 'also', 'problems', 'many', 'nationalities', 'have', 'growing', 'up', 'culture', 'far', 'removed', 'roots', 'seen', 'Jasira', 'father', 'when', 'must', 'learn', 'how', 'handle', 'daughter', 'who', 'sexual', 'appetite', 'ca', ""n't"", 'begin', 'understand', 'dealing', 'own', 'needs', 'man', 'when', 'solace', 'arms', 'American', 'woman', 'leaving', 'Jasira', 'fend', 'herself.Unfortunately', 'did', 'have', 'problem', 'minimal', 'incorporation', 'neighbor', 'played', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'keen', 'interest', 'Jasira', 'even', 'becomes', 'blue', 'mother', 'figure', 'Jasira', 'need', 'very', 'badly', 'section', 'was', 'so', 'rushed', 'was', 'forced', 'viewer.I', 'must', 'also', 'strike', 'note', 'caution', 'who', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'certain', 'unseemly', 'aspects', 'society', 'particularly', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'child', 'abuse', 'pedophilia', 'film', 'back', 'nothing', 'mean', 'N-O-T-H-I-N-G', 'young', 'girl', 'loss', 'hymen', 'adult', 'interracial', 'underage', 'sexual', 'experimentation', 'Towelhead', 'really', 'distance', 'showing', 'darker', 'side', 'world', ""'d"", 'rather', 'leave', 'closed', 'doors', 'opening', 'can', 'open', 'eyes', 'reveal', 'own', 'misunderstandings', 'surrounding', 'prejudices', 'neighbors', 'door.A', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'renting', 'seeing', 'can', 'handle']",N/A
1208629,A3LPD7NTGFH7V4,B001KQS3WU,bowery boy,"[1, 3]","THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS but I believe it's only fair that you know what you're getting into before viewing.  Read at your own risk.Towelhead (orginally titled Nothing Is Private) opens with 13 year old Jasira being coerced by her mother's boyfriend to let him to shave her p*bic area. She acquiesces. When her mother finds out she blames Jasira and promptly ships her off to live with her equally self-centered father.On her first morning with her father he violently slaps her because she wears a T-shirt and boxer shorts at the breakfast table. Then, when Jasira gets her period her father refuses to let her use tampons, only maxipads, which causes a humiliating incident at school. When her father discovers, through a clogged toilet, that Jasira has disobeyed him he goes ballistic and refuses to address her blossoming womanhood. These scenes set the tone for the rest of the movie.Jasira ges a regular babysitting job watching the 10 year old son of Army reservist neighbor Mr. Vuoso (played by the uber-hunky Aaron Eckhart. There should a law against being so damn sexy!). Jasira and her charge discover Vuoso's nudie magazine stash and soon afterward Jasira learns to pleasure herself to completion and does so at any given opportunity regardless of location (the source of several cringe inducing scenes).When she is caught looking at the magazines by Mr. Vuoso, he develops an inappropriate interest in her which culminates with him taking her virginity by force.  Meanwhile, Jasira is also being courted by Thomas, a black guy from school, who may actually like her but only wants to have sex with her.Confused by her changing body and conflicting sexual desires and obssessed with becoming desirable like the nude women in the magazines, Jasira oscillates between being sexually abused by Mr. Vuoso (clueless to the fact she is being raped) and sexually active with Thomas (whom her father hates because he's black).Then Jasira's pregnant neighbor Melina soon suspects what is going on between Jasira and Mr. Vuoso and becomes the only voice of reason and the only safe haven Jasira has in her sexually confusing and abusive world.I didn't have a problem with Towelhead's subject matter. I believe films that tackle taboo subjects are important but need to be done well. Towelhead tries to create a darkly humorous universe like a Todd Solondz film (Welcome to the Dollhouse or Happiness comes to mind). However, it presents itself in a straight forward manner that lacks the dark humor to create a balance with the drama. It doesn't help that all of the characters are two dimensional caricatures.Instead of awkwardly laughing, I felt uncomfortable and dirty throughout its entirety.  I would have given Towelhead 4 stars had its subject matter been handled more delicately, offset with a healthy dose of dark humor.  Nonetheless, it was an interesting film that entertained me and has stayed with me for days. Certianly not a film for ""mainstream"" audiences or conservative types and certianly not a humorous film to boot.",3,"AWKWARD, UNCOMFORTABLE AND LACKING HUMOR",1231718400,"01 12, 2009",2009,3043,"['THIS', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS', 'believe', 'only', 'fair', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'viewing', 'Read', 'own', 'risk.Towelhead', 'orginally', 'titled', 'Nothing', 'Is', 'Private', '13', 'year', 'old', 'Jasira', 'being', 'coerced', 'mother', 'boyfriend', 'let', 'shave', 'p*bic', 'area', 'When', 'mother', 'out', 'Jasira', 'promptly', 'off', 'live', 'equally', 'self-centered', 'father.On', 'first', 'morning', 'father', 'violently', 'T-shirt', 'boxer', 'shorts', 'breakfast', 'table', 'Then', 'when', 'Jasira', 'period', 'father', 'let', 'use', 'tampons', 'only', 'maxipads', 'humiliating', 'incident', 'school', 'When', 'father', 'discovers', 'clogged', 'toilet', 'Jasira', 'disobeyed', 'ballistic', 'address', 'blossoming', 'womanhood', 'scenes', 'set', 'tone', 'rest', 'movie.Jasira', 'regular', 'babysitting', 'job', 'watching', '10', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Army', 'reservist', 'neighbor', 'Mr.', 'Vuoso', 'played', 'uber-hunky', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'should', 'law', 'being', 'so', 'damn', 'sexy', 'Jasira', 'charge', 'discover', 'Vuoso', 'nudie', 'magazine', 'stash', 'soon', 'afterward', 'Jasira', 'pleasure', 'completion', 'so', 'given', 'opportunity', 'regardless', 'location', 'source', 'several', 'cringe', 'inducing', 'scenes', '.When', 'caught', 'looking', 'magazines', 'Mr.', 'Vuoso', 'inappropriate', 'interest', 'taking', 'virginity', 'force', 'Meanwhile', 'Jasira', 'also', 'being', 'courted', 'Thomas', 'black', 'guy', 'school', 'who', 'may', 'actually', 'like', 'only', 'have', 'sex', 'her.Confused', 'changing', 'body', 'conflicting', 'sexual', 'desires', 'obssessed', 'becoming', 'desirable', 'nude', 'women', 'magazines', 'Jasira', 'being', 'sexually', 'abused', 'Mr.', 'Vuoso', 'clueless', 'fact', 'being', 'raped', 'sexually', 'active', 'Thomas', 'whom', 'father', 'hates', 'black', '.Then', 'Jasira', 'pregnant', 'neighbor', 'Melina', 'soon', 'what', 'going', 'Jasira', 'Mr.', 'Vuoso', 'only', 'voice', 'reason', 'only', 'safe', 'haven', 'Jasira', 'sexually', 'confusing', 'abusive', 'world.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'Towelhead', 'subject', 'matter', 'believe', 'films', 'tackle', 'taboo', 'subjects', 'are', 'important', 'need', 'be', 'done', 'well', 'Towelhead', 'tries', 'create', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'universe', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'film', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'Happiness', 'mind', 'However', 'straight', 'forward', 'manner', 'dark', 'humor', 'create', 'balance', 'drama', ""n't"", 'help', 'characters', 'are', 'two', 'dimensional', 'caricatures.Instead', 'awkwardly', 'laughing', 'felt', 'uncomfortable', 'dirty', 'entirety', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'Towelhead', '4', 'stars', 'had', 'subject', 'matter', 'been', 'handled', 'more', 'delicately', 'offset', 'healthy', 'dose', 'dark', 'humor', 'Nonetheless', 'was', 'interesting', 'film', 'entertained', 'stayed', 'days', 'Certianly', 'not', 'film', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'conservative', 'types', 'certianly', 'not', 'humorous', 'film', 'boot']",N/A

1208632,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001KQS3WU,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Towelhead is a small film, done on a small budget, that has massive ideas. It's a compelling story. Well worth watching. Most will squirm, most will feel very uncomfortable. But it's a topic that requires a viewer to feel this way.The movie illustrates what happens when people use hate language, when they can't see the humanity in the other person. They can't look into another person's eyes and see a brother, a sister... but instead they see what is different, what is other than me, what is misunderstood, what is to be feared. This is Alan Ball discussing Towelhead in the second bonus feature on the DVD.This film confused and disturbed me during the first 7/8 of the film. At two hours and four minutes, that is a long time to be confused. The ending drives this film toward a conclusion that most can likely live with, not full reconcilliation, but a lot of realization. Then hearing Alan Ball talk about his film in the two special features, the film made sense.The story is about a 13 year old girl that is abused in many ways. There is nothing subtle or generally good about the people that surround Jasira. There are many moments where I knew what would happen, but kept saying no no no please don't let that happen. The scenes with the next door neighbor are creepy beyond imagination.But the film ends up being a lot more than a coming of age film. It's more about man's inhumanity to man. What Alan Ball says, we see the misunderstood, not that this is somebody's sister, or brother, or daughter. Instead there is a mob mentality that discriminates.On a film level, this is not exactly well done. The camera work is work-a-day television grade. The editing is slow and not well paced. The film could easily be 30 minutes shorter. The conflict is built for a bit too long, and the resolution comes as a wall, almost too fast. The acting is appropriate at all levels. The only detractor is Melina, played by Toni Collette. She is a kind soul, and pleasant, but she was a bit too one dimensional to me, maybe a bit too pleasant.There are much better films on this topic,Ben Xa Belgian film about a boy with autism that is horribly mistreated in ways much worse than Jasira;Boy Aa story about a boy after his release from prison for murdering a young girl,Edge of Heavena stunning film that hits closer to the mark directly on this topic. I highly recommend Edge of Heaven, especially if you enjoyed Towelhead.There's an interesting back debate about this film. The title, the subject matter, the way 13 year olds were portrayed. The bonus features of this DVD are illuminating, not because of what the horrible guests have to say, but what Alan Ball and Alicia Erin have to say in response. Alicia Erin is the author of Towelhead, the novel this movie was based on, and happens to be Arab-American. Alan Ball is openly homosexual. There is a way to view this movie as a horrible male fantasy. Sadly, viewing the film in this manner is probably not the best interpretation. Those particular scenes are never filmed directly, we get to see the lead up to and the aftermath, but never any intimate view of the act (if this truly were some sick fantasy piece, these scenes would have been filmed very differently).There are two bonus featurettes (totaling one hour and 21 minutes), supposedly ""community"" discussion of the film. They are well worth watching. The first guest actually watched the film, but had nothing but platitudes to say, with no depth. This discussion included the girl who played Jasira, her father, and the director. The second guest was pitiful, he had only read 3/4 of the book and had not seen the film. But he was inflamed by the title of the movie and had to make his point. This discussion included the author and the director. Watch more for the people involved in the film and their responses than these supposed expert guests.This film is rated R. There is no nudity (there is one scene where the female anatomy is shown in graphic detail in a book). It deals with a very mature subject, in a mature manner. There is virtually no violence. There is some strong language, but at appropriate times. A mature younger viewer could possibly watch this film.A difficult film that will make you squeemish at times.

Throw in a black boy friend (Eugene Jones III), some noisy neighbors, an army reservist Travis (Aaron Eckhart, who gets to play yet another jerk; c.f., his roles in Thank You for Smoking (2005) and In the Company of Men (1997)) who is smitten with her but doesn't know what to do about it (and what he does do, he does badly), and Jasira begins to live, shall we say, in interesting times.I think we can understand the relationship depicted between Travis and Jasira by realizing that a point is being made: even though Jasira comes on to him, he has a societal responsibility to deflect her school girl advances regardless of how he feels.  Her coming on to him is portrayed as girlish and equivocal.  Again his responsibility is to keep his hands off of her.  The overarching point is that no matter what happens between them since she is 13-years-old and he is an adult, it is entirely his fault.On the other hand, her experience with the ultra clean cut Thomas Bradley who is black is seemingly okay.  They took precautions and he was gentle and they were more or less equals.  All of this is carefully thought out to appeal to the mentality of a general audience.  Of course the mentality of the Arab-American counsel (if there is such a thing) as well as conservative religious groups in general, will find this outrageous.  In Islam countries you can be sure that this film is banned.What I liked about the movie was the light comedic intent from director Alan Ball, reminiscent of his work in the Academy Award winning American Beauty (1999) especially in the true-to-life (in a satirical way) the action is depicted, and in the way the men are a bit clueless.  Some of it was strange.  The ""competing"" flag poles, the business with the little white cat, Jasira's orgasms at the drop of...well at seeing pictures of naked women or rocking herself with her legs crossed--but perhaps there is a lesson here for someone: some people are polymorphous perverse (especially as children) as it was once said (by Freud, I think); that is, they have a generalized sense of sexuality.  And some people are auto erotic.I also liked the implicit forgiveness of the characters.  And I liked the way Ball didn't try to resolve the moral issues.  Certainly racism is wrong.  Certainly grown men cannot have sex with 13-year-olds.  But beyond that, Ball did not go in a prescriptive way.  Instead, through different characters he showed different points of view, all related to Jasira's awakening sexuality.  Finally I liked the character of Jasira, who was brave, assertive at times, passive at other times, and fair and honest with herself in the face of some demanding adolescent challenges.  And I liked the young actress who played her.  She was pretty, and very winning.  And, by the way, Summer Bishil was born in 1988 and therefore 18 or 19 years old when this movie came out.  She did a terrific job of acting 13.Note that the title of this movie, for politically correct reasons, one supposes, has been changed to ""Nothing Is Private.""

1208634,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B001KQS3WU,Dr. E,"[1, 1]","With a name likeTowelhead, one already anticipates a certain level of discomfort. (That's the first ""caution sign."") Moreover, with minimal investigation, the potential viewer knows this film addresses issues physical and sexual abuse (in frank detail). (That's the second ""caution sign""). And, dig slightly deeper into synopses and one discovers that the film addresses issues of ""consensual sex"" between a thirteen-year-old interracial couple (Jasira's father is an unapologetic racist, so this becomes an issue) AND repeated scenes involving the minutia of menstruation. (There's the third hint of ""caution""). Now, assemble all these pieces and what one may conclude is that he/she may not want to share this work with his/her teen. And there is nothing prudish about that decision. This is an extraordinarily complex film--amidst all the horrifying events, there are glimpses of love. This may confuse a young person. And, honestly, it may not be a sage choice to let a teen watch it privately if one is too fearful to enter into a discussion about it later (though I am personally not an advocate of censorship). So, please, don't buy this DVD for family-night--it probably won't run past the three-minute mark.With this said, I was impressed with Allan Ball's adaptation of Alicia Erian's novel. The film resounds a note of authenticity--though it's a truth most will not want to acknowledge. Watching young Jasira (Summer Bishil) attempt to navigate a her Texas school (where she is presumed Mexican because of her skin color) is excruciating. The audience wants to rush to her defense. Moreover, her callous, intimidating, abusive father renders her home uncertain and uncomfortable. He seems entirely unreachable. Even in her part-time job as a babysitter, Jasira is assaulted with racial epithets from her ten-year-old charge...and lasciviously leered at by child's father (played by Aaron Eckhart). These trials seem all too real. Yes, it is an uncomfortable film ... but reality can be uncomfortable. And, I think that every place Todd Solondz failed withHappiness(equally as controversial but not nearly as valuable), this film succeeds. Told from the perspective of an battered and confused young woman, this film (and the novel) opens a much needed dialogue. Regardless of race, many women are going to find some sliver of themselves in Jasira's character: even if it's only her attempts to come-to-terms with her sexuality (she notes our ""Playboy"" culture and how these air-brushed women represent one ""ideal"" ... and tries to understand her own sexuality in light of this.)Moreover, it is crucial to note that the film isn't a pitch-black examination of abuse. A neighboring family offers a haven to Jasira. They provide her with the care and attention she so desperately deserves. Likewise, there are moments of dark humor which prevent the film from being unbearably tragic.Summer Bishil was nominated for Best Female Lead by the 2008 Independent Spirit Awards for her role as Jasira. This should spark some confidence that this work isn't simply salacious or unreasonably inflammatory. And, it may actually help to know that while Bishil appears young on-screen, she was actually nineteen when the film was shot (twenty when released).With so many negative reviews (both from professional critics and lay-people), I was prepared to dislike this film. Instead, I walked away feeling strangely connected to it. I was touched by this young woman's struggle (although you might not be). It's a gamble. My suggestion is (if you are already interested in this work) to buy it and watch it in your leisure (perhaps alone, to avoid discomfort). And, return and post your own review ... regardless of the outcome.",4,"""How Can You Find Yourself if No One Can See You?""",1231977600,"01 15, 2009",2009,3724,"['name', 'likeTowelhead', 'one', 'already', 'certain', 'level', 'discomfort', 'first', 'caution', 'sign', 'Moreover', 'minimal', 'investigation', 'potential', 'viewer', 'film', 'issues', 'physical', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'frank', 'detail', 'second', 'caution', 'sign', 'dig', 'slightly', 'deeper', 'synopses', 'one', 'discovers', 'film', 'issues', 'consensual', 'sex', 'thirteen-year-old', 'interracial', 'couple', 'Jasira', 'father', 'unapologetic', 'racist', 'issue', 'repeated', 'scenes', 'involving', 'minutia', 'menstruation', 'third', 'hint', 'caution', 'Now', 'assemble', 'pieces', 'what', 'one', 'may', 'conclude', 'he/she', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'share', 'work', 'teen', 'nothing', 'prudish', 'decision', 'extraordinarily', 'complex', 'film', 'horrifying', 'events', 'are', 'glimpses', 'love', 'may', 'confuse', 'young', 'person', 'honestly', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'sage', 'choice', 'let', 'teen', 'watch', 'privately', 'one', 'too', 'fearful', 'enter', 'discussion', 'later', 'am', 'personally', 'not', 'advocate', 'censorship', 'So', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'family-night', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'run', 'three-minute', 'mark.With', 'said', 'was', 'impressed', 'Allan', 'Ball', 'adaptation', 'Alicia', 'Erian', 'novel', 'film', 'note', 'authenticity', 'truth', 'most', 'will', 'not', 'want', 'acknowledge', 'Watching', 'young', 'Jasira', 'Summer', 'Bishil', 'attempt', 'navigate', 'Texas', 'school', 'where', 'presumed', 'Mexican', 'skin', 'color', 'excruciating', 'audience', 'rush', 'defense', 'Moreover', 'callous', 'intimidating', 'abusive', 'father', 'renders', 'home', 'uncertain', 'uncomfortable', 'entirely', 'unreachable', 'Even', 'part-time', 'job', 'babysitter', 'Jasira', 'assaulted', 'racial', 'epithets', 'ten-year-old', 'charge', 'lasciviously', 'leered', 'child', 'father', 'played', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'trials', 'seem', 'too', 'real', 'Yes', 'uncomfortable', 'film', 'reality', 'can', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'think', 'place', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'failed', 'withHappiness', 'equally', 'controversial', 'not', 'nearly', 'valuable', 'film', 'Told', 'perspective', 'battered', 'confused', 'young', 'woman', 'film', 'novel', 'much', 'needed', 'dialogue', 'Regardless', 'race', 'many', 'women', 'are', 'going', 'find', 'sliver', 'Jasira', 'character', 'even', 'only', 'attempts', 'come-to-terms', 'sexuality', 'Playboy', 'culture', 'how', 'air-brushed', 'women', 'represent', 'one', 'ideal', 'tries', 'understand', 'own', 'sexuality', 'light', 'Moreover', 'crucial', 'note', 'film', ""n't"", 'pitch-black', 'examination', 'abuse', 'neighboring', 'family', 'haven', 'Jasira', 'provide', 'care', 'attention', 'so', 'desperately', 'Likewise', 'are', 'moments', 'dark', 'humor', 'prevent', 'film', 'being', 'unbearably', 'tragic.Summer', 'Bishil', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Female', 'Lead', '2008', 'Independent', 'Spirit', 'Awards', 'role', 'Jasira', 'should', 'spark', 'confidence', 'work', ""n't"", 'simply', 'salacious', 'unreasonably', 'inflammatory', 'may', 'actually', 'help', 'know', 'Bishil', 'young', 'on-screen', 'was', 'actually', 'nineteen', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'twenty', 'when', 'released', '.With', 'so', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'professional', 'critics', 'lay-people', 'was', 'prepared', 'dislike', 'film', 'Instead', 'walked', 'away', 'feeling', 'strangely', 'connected', 'was', 'touched', 'young', 'woman', 'struggle', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'gamble', 'suggestion', 'are', 'already', 'interested', 'work', 'buy', 'watch', 'leisure', 'perhaps', 'alone', 'avoid', 'discomfort', 'return', 'post', 'own', 'review', 'regardless', 'outcome']",N/A

The audience for a film based on variations of child abuse and racism and prejudice and dismembered parenting and the physical coming of age of our youth may be small, but for those who had the courage to view TOWELHEAD either in the theater release or on DVD, the rewards are plentiful.13-year-old Jasira (Summer Bashil in an impressive debut) lives with her mother Gail (Maria Bello) and the live-in boyfriend Barry (Chris Messina) until an inappropriate physical advance results in Gail's denial and Jasira is sent to Texas to live with her Lebanese American Christian father Rifat (Peter Macdissi) just as Bush's preemptive Iraq War is opening.  Transported to a strange world Jasira suffers the prejudices of her holier-than-thou father and in addition to school is forced to get a job babysitting - with the next-door son Zack (Chase Ellison) whose parents are redneck bigots Evelyn (Carrie Preston) and Travis Vuoso.  At the Vuoso's home Jasira discovers Travis' girlie magazines shared by Zack, and Jasira's burgeoning sexuality emerges.  Both at Zack's house and at school Jasira is treated as an outsider (she is half Arab half American) and endures verbal abuse from everyone - the only exception is a young African American student Thomas (Eugene Jones) who pays attention to her as a beautiful, physically mature young woman.  Jasira's need to be loved and to belong leads her into situations that cross borders of proper behavior - both with Thomas and with the predator Travis.  Incidents occur as Jasira learns about physical relationships and the only caring deterrent adult is the very pregnant neighbor Melina (Toni Collette)  who with her husband Gil (Matt Letscher) attempt to protect Jasira from abuse. How Jasira copes with her inept parents, the cloud of prejudice,  and her approach/avoidance feelings about her sexuality forms the conclusion of the story.Yes, the subject is tough, and yes, there are moments when better writing and better direction could have delineated character development and the presentation of the pertinent incidents could have made the movie more thoroughly acceptable, but given the concept of the film, the actors are each strong enough to make their characters credible.  Bashil, Eckhart, Colette, Macdissi, Jones, and Bello are superb as is the supporting cast.  This film may take a few years to cool off before it is more widely accepted.  It deserves a wider audience who will be willing to face issues the film presents.

Combined with her burgeoning adolescent sexual awareness, the young girl strives to sort out who she is and what her feelings mean.  She is attracted to an African-American boy at her school, but at the same time, she notices the effect she has on the adult men surrounding her in the neighborhood.  Especially the next-door neighbor, Travis Vuoso (Aaron Eckhart).Then when Mr. Vuoso makes inappropriate overtures, the young girl is unable to understand the implications.  Sexual conflict, molestation, and a father's strict corporal punishment thrust this coming-of-age tale into a drama of epic proportions.Meanwhile, another young neighborhood couple, Gil and Melina Hines - portrayed by Toni Collette and Matt Letscher - offer sanctuary while Jasira tries to sort out the conflicting messages that constantly barrage her in this new life.In the end, what will Jasira learn from her experiences?  Will she accept the normal feelings while separating out those that serve to victimize her?  The ending is surprisingly touching - lending an authenticity to the feelings and experiences of a young girl facing normal conflicts in a surreal time and place.Laurel-Rain SnowAuthor of:Web of Tyranny, etc.",5,Bigotry and War in a Time of Sexual Awakening...,1231804800,"01 13, 2009",2009,1702,"['early', '90s', 'Gulf', 'War', 'looming', 'young', 'girl', 'American', 'mother', 'Lebanese', 'father', 'caught', 'up', 'prejudice', 'times', 'also', 'confused', 'sexual', 'dynamics', 'mother', 'new', 'relationship', 'mother', 'reacts', 'sending', 'Texas', 'live', 'father.Thus', 'drama', 'new', 'suburban', 'neighborhood', 'school', 'force', 'Jasira', 'Maroun', 'portrayed', 'Summer', 'Bashil', 'confront', 'dilemmas', 'created', 'parentage', 'time', 'war', 'bigotry', 'Combined', 'burgeoning', 'adolescent', 'sexual', 'awareness', 'young', 'girl', 'strives', 'sort', 'out', 'who', 'what', 'feelings', 'mean', 'attracted', 'African-American', 'boy', 'school', 'same', 'time', 'effect', 'adult', 'men', 'surrounding', 'neighborhood', 'Especially', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'Travis', 'Vuoso', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', '.Then', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Vuoso', 'inappropriate', 'overtures', 'young', 'girl', 'unable', 'understand', 'implications', 'Sexual', 'conflict', 'molestation', 'father', 'strict', 'corporal', 'punishment', 'thrust', 'coming-of-age', 'tale', 'drama', 'epic', 'proportions.Meanwhile', 'young', 'neighborhood', 'couple', 'Gil', 'Melina', 'Hines', 'portrayed', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Matt', 'Letscher', 'offer', 'sanctuary', 'Jasira', 'tries', 'sort', 'out', 'conflicting', 'messages', 'constantly', 'new', 'end', 'what', 'will', 'Jasira', 'learn', 'experiences', 'Will', 'accept', 'normal', 'feelings', 'separating', 'out', 'serve', 'victimize', 'ending', 'surprisingly', 'touching', 'lending', 'authenticity', 'feelings', 'experiences', 'young', 'girl', 'facing', 'normal', 'conflicts', 'surreal', 'time', 'place.Laurel-Rain', 'SnowAuthor', 'Web', 'Tyranny', 'etc']",N/A

1208648,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001KQS3WU,Roland E. Zwick,"[17, 20]","****1/2Even at the tender young age of 13, the strikingly beautiful Jasira seems destined to go through life igniting the passions of the men and boys around her.  A product of a mixed marriage (her mother is white, her father Lebanese) and a broken home, she lives with her strict, traditionalist dad in a Texas suburb during the time of the first Gulf War.  Though shy by nature, Jasira seems wise beyond her years when it comes to exploring her burgeoning sexuality.  Like many girls her age, she dreams of one day becoming a famous model like the ones she sees in fashion magazines or on billboards around town.  Yet, despite the sternness and rigidity of her father, Jasira winds up getting involved with both a black boy at school and the middle-aged family man who lives two doors down.With ""Towelhead,"" writer/director Alan Ball returns to the theme of simmering suburban eroticism that he explored so effectively in ""American Beauty"" and ""Six Feet Under.""  Indeed, it`s safe to say that ""Towelhead"" is possibly the most perceptive, frank and intelligent exploration of teenage sexuality I've ever seen on film.  Somehow Ball has managed to take a subject that could easily have become exploitative and sensationalistic and turned into a moving and compassionate tale of flawed individuals who, despite the fact that they may mean well, often act in ways that cause serious harm to others.  As is true of every teen, Jasira is naturally curious about her body and intrigued by that secret, forbidden world of pleasure to which only grownups seem somehow privy.  The trouble is that Jasira is surrounded by adults who provide her with either weak or contradictory guidance, or who can't control their own urges long enough to think about the harm they might be inflicting on others with their actions.  On a broader scale, Ball questions how modern teens can be expected to make wise decisions about sex when they are routinely bombarded with mixed messages from a culture that is both highly sexualized and highly puritanical at one and the same time.  Often times, we get the sense that Jasira is using her new found sexuality - without yet fully understanding the powerful effect it is having on the males around her - to fill an emotional void in her life, a void caused by a mother and a father who are so caught up in their own lives that they have little left over for their daughter.  To a somewhat lesser extent, the movie also touches on the racism that exists in not only the white culture but the nonwhite culture as well.  For while Jasira is being taunted by the kids at school for her dark skin (even though many assume she is Mexican), her own father is forbidding her to date a black boy who has taken a romantic interest in her.Ball has populated his story (based on the novel by Alicia Erian) with a rich array of complex, multi-dimensional characters, each one a unique and closely observed individual.  Beyond the intriguing Jasira, there is her hot-tempered father who, in his own, perhaps clumsy, way clearly loves his daughter but who is so bound in by the traditions of his culture that he can't even begin to understand what is going on in her heart.  There is the kind, pragmatic next door neighbor who keeps her eye on the girl and extends the hand of friendship when it is needed most.  And, finally, there is the older man caught between what he knows is right and his compelling need to seduce a child young enough to be his own daughter.  Ball makes it clear that none of these characters is a hero or a villain, that life is simply too messy and complex a business for us to be assigning such roles to individuals.  Yet, he clearly acknowledges that there is such a thing as going over the line, and that adults need to understand that their own desires should never be fulfilled at the expense of others more vulnerable than themselves.Summer Bishil is heartbreaking and utterly believable as young Jashira, while Peter Macdissi infuses both a sense of menace and a strangely offbeat humor into the role of her hardnosed, dogmatic father.  Toni Collete is her usual first rate self as the older woman who takes Jasira under her wing, offering her the kind of guidance her actual parents seem either unwilling or unable to provide for her.  As the neighbor who seduces Jasira, Aaron Eckhart brings a great deal of courage, subtlety and restraint to one of the trickiest roles imaginable for an actor.  Eckhart is obviously secure in the conviction that the audience will be mature enough to see the humanity in his character even while feeling disgust at his actions.In fact, that's pretty much the way it is with the entire film.  There are some who will be instantly turned off by the highly sensitive nature of the subject matter.  But, true artist that he is, Ball has been able to transcend the sleaze to provide us with a heartbreaking human drama that, by touching on the universal, is able to strike a chord of familiarity in the audience.Put simply, ""Towelhead"" is one of the very best films of 2008.",4,one of 2008's best films,1231372800,"01 8, 2009",2009,5049,"['****1/2Even', 'tender', 'young', 'age', '13',

What we have here are a bunch of stereotypical characters victimizing a thirteen-year old Lebanese girl repeatedly. Very little of the story deals with her heritage and coping with that in a bigoted society, and when it does it feels very artificial and forced. The focus of the film seems to be on the girl's nascent sexuality, and pretty soon ""Towelhead"" devolves into a series of scenes that feel, track, and sound like something you'd experience in soft-core porn. I'll give this a star for making people squirm and the guts the actress has for participating in this cinematic sadism, but I did not develop a deeper understanding of life experienced by Middle Easterners as they try to cope with bigotry and misunderstanding. The coming-of-age aspect of the film simply flattens any other subject.",2,Approaches mere exploitation,1233014400,"01 27, 2009",2009,838,"['substance', 'movie', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'are', 'bunch', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'victimizing', 'thirteen-year', 'old', 'Lebanese', 'girl', 'repeatedly', 'Very', 'little', 'story', 'deals', 'heritage', 'coping', 'bigoted', 'society', 'when', 'feels', 'very', 'artificial', 'forced', 'focus', 'film', 'be', 'girl', 'nascent', 'sexuality', 'pretty', 'soon', 'Towelhead', 'series', 'scenes', 'feel', 'track', 'sound', 'something', ""'d"", 'experience', 'soft-core', 'porn', ""'ll"", 'give', 'star', 'making', 'people', 'squirm', 'guts', 'actress', 'participating', 'cinematic', 'sadism', 'did', 'not', 'develop', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'life', 'experienced', 'Middle', 'Easterners', 'try', 'cope', 'bigotry', 'misunderstanding', 'coming-of-age', 'aspect', 'film', 'simply', 'other', 'subject']",N/A

By the end of the film, the protagonist of the story, Jashira does not see anything wrong with having sex with Thomas... even though she is THIRTEEN YEARS OLD. Yes, this is an intriguing film. I did enjoy it at times. I get that it's supposed to be provocative and get you to think. However, I find her sexual relationship with Thomas just as disturbing as that with her next door neighbor... because at least with her neighbor she realized that something was wrong. Not once does she think that perhaps she is too young to be having sex, period. I'm writing this as a liberal NYC high school teacher. I just find it so sad that 13 year olds don't seem to have any innocence anymore.",3,An Intriguing Film but A Horrible Message,1255046400,"10 9, 2009",2009,760,"['SPOLIER', 'WARNINGI', 'am', 'shocked', 'one', 'else', 'point', 'out', 'obvious', 'end', 'film', 'protagonist', 'story', 'Jashira', 'not', 'see', 'anything', 'wrong', 'having', 'sex', 'Thomas', 'even', 'THIRTEEN', 'YEARS', 'OLD', 'Yes', 'intriguing', 'film', 'did', 'enjoy', 'times', 'get', 'supposed', 'be', 'provocative', 'get', 'think', 'However', 'find', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'Thomas', 'just', 'as', 'disturbing', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'because', 'least', 'neighbor', 'realized', 'something', 'was', 'wrong', 'Not', 'once', 'think', 'perhaps', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'having', 'sex', 'period', ""'m"", 'writing', 'liberal', 'NYC', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'just', 'find', 'so', 'sad', '13', 'year', 'olds', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'innocence', 'anymore']",N/A
