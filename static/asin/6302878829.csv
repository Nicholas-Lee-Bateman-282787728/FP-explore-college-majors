The character of John Wisdom is brought to life as he becomes a criminal for the people in this greatly written film.  The concept and story of the film is unparalleled to any film since and delivers riveting performances by both Estevez and Moore.  A definite sleeper hit!!,4,Excellent film with a great ending!,1039132800,"12 6, 2002",2002,327,"['one', 'best', 'movies', 'Estevez', 'career', 'character', 'John', 'Wisdom', 'brought', 'life', 'criminal', 'people', 'greatly', 'written', 'film', 'concept', 'story', 'film', 'unparalleled', 'film', 'delivers', 'riveting', 'performances', 'Estevez', 'Moore', 'A', 'definite', 'sleeper', 'hit']",N/A

No budget problems, unemployment or forced foreclosures we see nowadays in the united states. Course in 86 i was a stupid 16 year old teenager who did not understand the plot of this movie but enjoyed it very much. Like many of these young actors of this era i was an angst ridden teen living in the awesome 80s that they were playing in these films. Now a mature educated 41 year old how true this films plot and themes holds true in today's times. Who knew Emilio Estevez had the future down to a t back in 86 to ring true in 2011, Sad but true. He made a great debut film filled with heart, action, suspense, and humor. Emilio and Demi just burn the screen with chemistry as young lovers on the run ala Bonnie and Clyde. Even though this is a dvd-r and no features or commentaries,it offers fabulous color and in widescreen and the surround sound rocks even though not in 5.1 its still AWESOME. The Warner archive collection is a great string of older films we all grew up with.

Its about a young man at 23 who isntbad on the inside just made one mistake by driving a stolen car while intoxicated and while he tries to make good and try to get a job somewhere his attempts are thwarted by his past record. society never learns to forgive when you make a mistake wheather it is towards a person or to yourself. I feel bad for emilio estevezs character because I was in a similar situation where a woman got so angry with me about something and eight years have gone by and she still cant forgive or accept my apology. It seems the only choice he had was to become a hero for the people in this day and age who doesnt dream of becoming a hero. Demi moore is great in her role as his girl and partner.

Along with Maximum Overdrive, he plays the hero/antihero role well. Most Americans could identify with the economic problems facing the farmers who John Wisdom was trying to help. Wisdoms methods were at first shocking, however, in this day and age, shock is the only way of gettng past the largely ignorant, jaded media, more interested in Britney Spears lack of hair than the fact that we are importing 800 billion dollars more than we export to other contries.
