905419,A3UY5Z7VJO9RPP,B0009H97H6,frank camp,"[0, 0]",A little dull. Sort of a Dukes Of Hazzard without the car chases. Don Johnson's a kid trying to make his air-boat into Water Version of THE GENERAL LEE. Moonshine is of course involved. The big event is the Annual Coon Dog Race. Ben Johnson's dog is the reigning champion. A &#34;Famous&#34; Country Music singer (a ten cent version of Tanya Tucker) has come to town for the sole purpose of buying that champion coon dog. She blows in Ben Johnson's ear trying to convince him to sell him to her. I don't know how I could stand so much excitement. About the only laughs come from Dub Taylor's dog who's flatulence is so raunchy he can empty a building QUICKER THAN A HAND GRENADE. That was really funny......when I was 12.,2,Saw this as a kid. It was more interesting back then,1399939200,"05 13, 2014",2014,721,"['little', 'dull', 'Sort', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'car', 'chases', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'kid', 'trying', 'make', 'air-boat', 'Water', 'Version', 'THE', 'GENERAL', 'LEE', 'Moonshine', 'course', 'involved', 'big', 'event', 'Annual', 'Coon', 'Dog', 'Race', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'dog', 'reigning', 'champion', 'A', '34', 'Famous', '34', 'Country', 'Music', 'singer', 'ten', 'cent', 'version', 'Tanya', 'Tucker', 'come', 'town', 'sole', 'purpose', 'buying', 'champion', 'coon', 'dog', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'ear', 'trying', 'convince', 'sell', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'could', 'stand', 'so', 'much', 'excitement', 'only', 'come', 'Dub', 'Taylor', 'dog', 'who', 'flatulence', 'so', 'raunchy', 'can', 'empty', 'building', 'QUICKER', 'THAN', 'A', 'HAND', 'GRENADE', 'was', 'really', 'funny', 'when', 'was', '12']",N/A
