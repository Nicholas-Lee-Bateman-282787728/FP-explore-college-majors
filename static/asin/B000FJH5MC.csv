It was funny to see that he had another series that I hadn't even heard of before, in bright yellow packaging, sitting right next to the ""County"" DVD set.  Read the reviews online & bought the set, and I enjoyed it immensely.  He's a Revolutionary spy banished to Palau-Palau for fooling around with the president's daughter, and becomes sort of a Clark Kent/Superman persona in the form of a personal valet/costumed protector of the people, thwarting Napolean's worldwide ambitions for domination of the world.

991637,A32VHSK5LPVJKE,B000FJH5MC,Bice,"[27, 51]","Whenever you see Bruce Campbell's name in the credits of a TV show ormovie, you can be sure that it's going to be something offbeat, andusually either very good or very bad.  Unfortunately, Jack of AllTrades falls in the latter category.Like a couple other reviewers, I had never even heard of this showuntil Amazon recommended it to me when I looked at the Brisco Countypage.  If you're looking for a Bruce Campbell TV series and haven'tseen Brisco yet, I'd definitely recommend investing in that DVD setover this one, even though the price is a lot steeper.  EverythingThe Adventures of Brisco County did right, Jack of All Trades doeswrong.  Brisco had some unrealistic plots, but things were always keptrelatively believable, and the characters were (as described in thecommentary) ""just under over-the-top"".  The Jack of All Trade plotsare completely ridiculous, and most of the characters are so far overthe top, they can't even see the top from where they are (Blackbeardthe pirate is just painful to watch).Jack of All Trades is so cheesy and campy, it makes the Rocky HorrorPicture Show look dignified by comparison.  It's so slapstick, itmakes the Three Stooges seem like intellectuals.  There are so manyanachronisms, they might as well have just set it in modern times(but then we wouldn't have been treated to a midget playing Napoleon).Lame jokes and horrible puns abound.Worst of all, the show goes out of its way to make every conceivablejuvenile sex joke that can possibly be wedged into the plot.  Seriously,it seems like the show was written by desperate junior high school boys.Add in the fact that they get every female character into tight, skimpyoutfits whenever possible, and maybe it WAS written by junior highschoolers.  It certainly seems aimed at them.  You can tell by theabundance of fart jokes.I can't believe how many four and five star reviews this show gotfrom Amazon users.  They only things it had going for it were acharismatic actor in Campbell (who is mostly wasted), an insanelycatchy theme song, and...well, a lot of girls in skimpy outfits.There was obviously some money put into the costumes, sets, specialeffects, etc, but they really should have considered spending someof that money to hire a real writer or two.  This show suffers fromthe greatest failing a comedy can have - it's just not funny.Sometimes painfully unfunny.  The premise of the show isn't bad,and it COULD have been good, but they ruined it by going for thelowest common denominator every chance they got.The show reminds me a lot of the original Batman (the Adam Westversion, not the later movies), and I never liked that one either,even when I was a kid.  But if enjoyed Batman, you might like Jack.It wasn't for me though.  I feel like my I.Q. dropped about 20 pointsjust from watching it.  I did manage to sit through all 22 episodes,but I doubt I'll ever watch any of them again.  Save your money onthis one.  It'll probably turn up in reruns eventually anyway.By the way, if you do order this DVD set, make sure you check thespines of the DVD cases before opening the shrink wrap.  The firstset I received had two copies of disc 2 and no disc 1.  I didn'tdiscover that fact until I had already ripped off the shrink wrap.Fortunately, Amazon was nice enough to replace my copy even thoughit had been opened and was past the return cut off date.",1,Big disappointment after Brisco,1173225600,"03 7, 2007",2007,3363,"['Whenever', 'see', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'name', 'credits', 'TV', 'show', 'ormovie', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'going', 'be', 'something', 'offbeat', 'andusually', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'bad', 'Unfortunately', 'Jack', 'AllTrades', 'falls', 'latter', 'category.Like', 'couple', 'other', 'reviewers', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'showuntil', 'Amazon', 'recommended', 'when', 'looked', 'Brisco', 'Countypage', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'TV', 'series', ""haven'tseen"", 'Brisco', 'yet', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'investing', 'DVD', 'setover', 'one', 'even', 'price', 'lot', 'steeper', 'EverythingThe', 'Adventures', 'Brisco', 'County', 'did', 'right', 'Jack', 'All', 'Trades', 'doeswrong', 'Brisco', 'had', 'unrealistic', 'plots', 'things', 'were', 'always', 'keptrelatively', 'believable', 'characters', 'were', 'described', 'thecommentary', 'just', 'over-the-top', 'Jack', 'All', 'Trade', 'plotsare', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'far', 'overthe', 'top', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'top', 'where', 'are', 'Blackbeardthe', 'pirate', 'just', 'painful', 'watch', '.Jack', 'All', 'Trades', 'so', 'cheesy', 'campy', 'Rocky', 'HorrorPicture', 'Show', 'look', 'dignified', 'comparison', 'so', 'slapstick', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'seem', 'intellectuals', 'are', 'so', 'manyanachronisms', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'just', 'set', 'modern', 'times', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'treated', 'midget', 'playing', 'Napoleon', '.Lame', 'jokes', 'horrible', 'puns', 'show', 'way', 'make', 'conceivablejuvenile', 'sex', 'joke', 'can', 'possibly', 'be', 'wedged', 'plot', 'Seriously', 'show', 'was', 'written', 'desperate', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'boys.Add', 'fact', 'get', 'female', 'character', 'tight', 'skimpyoutfits', 'whenever', 'possible', 'maybe', 'WAS', 'written', 'junior', 'highschoolers', 'certainly', 'aimed', 'can', 'tell', 'theabundance', 'fart', 'jokes.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'many', 'four', 'five', 'star', 'reviews', 'show', 'Amazon', 'users', 'only', 'things', 'had', 'going', 'were', 'acharismatic', 'actor', 'Campbell', 'who', 'mostly', 'wasted', 'insanelycatchy', 'theme', 'song', 'well', 'lot', 'girls', 'skimpy', 'outfits.There', 'was', 'obviously', 'money', 'put', 'costumes', 'sets', 'specialeffects', 'etc', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'considered', 'spending', 'someof', 'money', 'hire', 'real', 'writer', 'two', 'show', 'fromthe', 'greatest', 'failing', 'comedy', 'can', 'have', 'just', 'not', 'funny.Sometimes', 'painfully', 'unfunny', 'premise', 'show', ""n't"", 'bad', 'COULD', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'ruined', 'going', 'thelowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'chance', 'got.The', 'show', 'lot', 'original', 'Batman', 'Adam', 'Westversion', 'not', 'later', 'movies', 'never', 'liked', 'one', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'enjoyed', 'Batman', 'might', 'like', 'Jack.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'feel', 'I.Q', 'dropped', '20', 'pointsjust', 'watching', 'did', 'manage', 'sit', '22', 'episodes', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'watch', 'again', 'Save', 'money', 'one', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'turn', 'up', 'reruns', 'eventually', 'anyway.By', 'way', 'do', 'order', 'DVD', 'set', 'make', 'sure', 'check', 'thespines', 'DVD', 'cases', 'opening', 'shrink', 'wrap', 'firstset', 'received', 'had', 'two', 'copies', 'disc', '2', 'disc', '1', ""didn'tdiscover"", 'fact', 'had', 'already', 'ripped', 'off', 'shrink', 'wrap.Fortunately', 'Amazon', 'was', 'nice', 'enough', 'replace', 'copy', 'even', 'thoughit', 'had', 'been', 'opened', 'was', 'return', 'cut', 'off', 'date']",N/A

And, while it would be nice to have even minimal extra features, I'm happy enough just to have the show at long last.The show itself has, of course, just what you'd expect from Bruce Campbell: fun, action, anachronism, and a few surprisingly touching moments. The standout for me, though, has always been Napoleon portrayed as a midget (who doesn't even bother trying to speak with the hilarious fake French accent that the other ""french fries"" use). The opening theme is fantastic, and the chemistry between the leads works wonderfully.The episodes don't appear exactly in order, which is odd (the first time we see the parrot, they know him, but in the next episode, Jack and Emilia meet the parent for what appears to be the first time). I don't see why they didn't just put the episodes in a sensible order. But that's just nitpicking.

In the early nineties Bruce Campbell burst on to the scene with an original and fresh personae that was side-clutching, rolling on the floor hilarious at times. I remember being devastated when they stopped producing Brisco County, and then so excited when they announced Jack of All Trades. I didn't get to see the Jack series though as it wasn't carried in my area. I decided to rectify that last month and order the series as a kind of an early Christmas present to myself. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. I am not sure whether I would have found this series funny or entertaining a dozen years ago when it was released, but after watching the first two episodes I just didn't care to watch any more of them. I felt that the half hour format didn't permit any real character development or permit them to write any really interesting plots to build on the Wild, Wild West promise of the show. Or maybe it is just that I am older and my tastes have changed. But, for whatever reason, the show did not grab me at all and I don't see myself wasting any more time watching additional episodes. I love watching Bruce Campbell, but the magic of Brisco County, Jr. just didn't seem to be present in this series. If you are a real Bruce Campbell fan though you might go ahead and give this a try. Just because it fell flat for me doesn't mean it will for you. I think Bruce Campbell is a one-of-a-kind and maybe I just hit this on a bad day.

An American spy, Jack, he is assigned to work with an English spy on a potty little French island in the South Pacific, trying their best to foil the French secret plans to rule the world. The two of them are posing as an English merchant and her aide. Notice I said ""her."" She is Emilia, a feisty scientist and inventor and the actress who plays her is a perfect foil for our Bruce. The two characters bicker with each other and scheme behind each other's backs to achieve their own countries' aims but nevertheless show genuine respect and affection for each other.Into this mixture rides Jack as his heroic alter ego, The Dashing Dragoon, complete with black mask, sword, huge swirling red cape, and his trusty horse, Nutcracker. He foils villains and exposes plots and rescues people, that is, when he doesn't fall over his own cape or have to be rescued by Emilia.No famous historical icon is safe in this series, from President Jefferson to Benjamin Franklin to Czarina Catherine of Russia to King George of England to Napoleon, a true ""Little Corporal"" played with great gusto by a midget.

This provides the foundation for 22 episodes' worth of pure zaniness centered on the Moonlighting-esque relationship between Jack and Emilia, and their continuing misadventures as they elude the idiot French governor and his even more buffoonish army commandant, encounter historical figures including Napoleon himself (played by Verne Troyer, a/k/a Mini-Me), Benjamin Franklin, James Madison, Lewis and Clark and Blackbeard, and exchange politically incorrect and risque one-liners.

The costuming, clever dialogue, the obvious chemistry between the two stars, the intricate plots....and the good guys always winning, make a truly ""winning"" combination.  HOWEVER -- I must agree with the reviewer who titled a review, ""NOT FOR CHILDREN""...because this show definitely is NOT for children.  I'm surprised it isn't rated...but I would give it an ""R"" rating, becausesexual innuendo is always in every episode.  Not dwelt upon -- but always there.  Then there was the (to me, astounding), episode where-in our hero and heroine meet, (of all people!)............ the Marquis de Sade (?!!!!)  Sitting in front of the TV, when THIS episode was first aired, and even during this episode's repeats, I wondered how that episode, anyway, EVER got passed the censors!  Maybe it did because the show is mainly about high spirits, the clever dialogue, interesting stories, wonderful costuming, scenery, direction -- and the aforesaid good guys, winning every time! (Oh, HOW much I wished for a time-travel episode, wherein our hero and heroine would get mixed up with, for instance, J. Edgar Hoover -- or Senator Joseph McCarthy, (or even Senator Eugene McCarthy!), or -- or Richard Nixon!  (Perhaps someday a movie could be made of J.O.A.T.....and they could meet one of these people -- or Teddy Roosevelt?  George H.W. Bush?  I'm smiling just thinking of the possibility!)Now, I'm a person who really, totally ABHORS four-letter words, (or even their euphenistic equivalent...  The four-letter words do NOT appear in thsi program, of course....but there is plenty of double-entrendre, with equivalents and other PG+ statements, cleverly added within the often rollicking dialogue), and I do not like lewdness of any kind.  But (even?) I adored -- and adore -- this show!  Why? Because  I like the costuming, direction, storylines...and most of all, the sense of PERSONAL FREEDOM, JOY, AND DEVIL-MAY-CARE INSOUCIANCE exuded by Jack, and also at times, by his beautiful female partner!  They know there is danger...but hey, why not have a good time, while fighting for the right?  It's the same attitude that has made 007 such a winner!  There are plenty of sight-gags, hilarious anachronisms, and jokes that sound as if they got their inspiration from ""Get Smart"", and/or the Marx Brothers, (Bruce Campbell even SOUNDS like Groucho Marx, at times -- or is it that he is so totally into the fun and frolic of the dialogue and action?  One of the sight-gags is all-too-obvious in some episodes: since this is an ""spy-spoof"", in which an American and British agent work together, the enemy here is.....France!  And more particularly, the leader of France at the time: NAPOLEON BONAPARTE!  Everyone knows that Napoleon was short...but in this spoof, he is played, (well and with great relish)....BY A DWARF!  (There is also a talking cockatoo on the show, who wears a tiny 3-cornered hat, and speaks -- not in ""parroted"" words, but with totally, grammatically-correct English!  That this program is more comedy than spy drama is evident from the first episode -- but all the actors seem to be having SUCH a good time acting -- and probably the production crew likewise enjoyed themselves SO much -- that one tends to forget some of the ridiculous dialogue, and even more ridiculous situations.  The good fun sweeps the viewer along, and one cannot help but be caught up in the merriment! (Note, however, that this is definitely a show for 15-year-old + people -- or your children might be spouting words of great embarrasment to you, without their even knowing the meanings of them!  Still, I'd rather kids see THIS show, than some of TODAY'S ""R"" rated comedies, (or even some of today's science fiction -- sigh! -- because there's SO much more in ""Jack of All Trades"" than sexual innuendo!In these days of the early 21st century, when ""The Patriot Act"", mandatory ID cards, (with perhaps even more through ID cards to come!), and other things, threaten our senses of privacy, and personal pride and sense of individuality, this is truly a refreshing, (and highly entertaining!) reminder of what freedom really is, why freedom is worth fighting for, and what freedom really means!  The show is a lark, a joy, very well done, with exciting stories, beautiful costuming, great production values in general --- and a happy, devil-may-care-but-we-love-freedom-and-we-good-guys-will-surely-win-in-the-end, (tra-la!) message!

The series showed the humorous adventures of a American spy out to stop the nefarious plans of the dictator Napoleon with the help of another spy from England but both would work on a remote and almost unknown island controlled by the french empire.  The series was of course not to be taken seriously like they tried to do somewhat with its sister show Cleopatra but instead intentionally kept most of the series light and funny while showing some cameo of actual historic figures though of course in a comedic way most time including the nefarious Napoleon.  The show only lasted twenty-two episodes though which is sad because it truly was a entertaining series especially since the producers other mentioned shows Hercules and Xena were starting to fall with their entertainment values after season four for Hercules and season three for Xena respectively.  So for fan of Bruce Campbell here's another great series of his sadly cut short worth getting  especially for this price and for fans looking for comedic wartime shows similar a little to series like Hogans Hero's here's a pretty good choice too...,5,A Entertaining Series Filled With Action And Humor,1275868800,"06 7, 2010",2010,1479,"['Feeding', 'off', 'high', 'ratings', 'two', 'other', 'series', 'Hercules', 'Legendary', 'Journeys', 'Xena', 'Warrior', 'Princess', 'producers', 'came', 'out', 'two', 'thirty', 'minute', 'Cleopatra', '2525', 'Sadly', 'lacked', 'entertainment', 'Jack', 'Trades', 'neither', 'lasted', 'long', 'series', 'feel', 'Jack', 'All', 'Trades', 'was', 'vastly', 'superior', 'two', 'series', 'showed', 'humorous', 'adventures', 'American', 'spy', 'stop', 'nefarious', 'plans', 'dictator', 'Napoleon', 'help', 'spy', 'England', 'would', 'work', 'remote', 'almost', 'unknown', 'island', 'controlled', 'french', 'empire', 'series', 'was', 'course', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'tried', 'do', 'somewhat', 'sister', 'show', 'Cleopatra', 'instead', 'intentionally', 'kept', 'most', 'series', 'light', 'funny', 'showing', 'cameo', 'actual', 'historic', 'figures', 'course', 'comedic', 'way', 'most', 'time', 'including', 'nefarious', 'Napoleon', 'show', 'only', 'lasted', 'twenty-two', 'episodes', 'sad', 'truly', 'was', 'entertaining', 'series', 'especially', 'producers', 'other', 'mentioned', 'shows', 'Hercules', 'Xena', 'were', 'starting', 'fall', 'entertainment', 'values', 'season', 'four', 'Hercules', 'season', 'three', 'Xena', 'respectively', 'So', 'fan', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'here', 'great', 'series', 'sadly', 'cut', 'short', 'worth', 'getting', 'especially', 'price', 'fans', 'looking', 'comedic', 'wartime', 'similar', 'little', 'series', 'Hogans', 'Hero', 'here', 'pretty', 'good', 'choice', 'too']",N/A

He also rescues Ben Franklin from Napoleon who hopes that Franklin will come up with the ultimate weapon and Jack appears as a masked folk hero the Daring Dragoon (great name)when he tangles with the French governor Croque.

The DVDs look extremely good with nice full screen transfers and colors that pop off the screen.Unfortunately Universal has decided to release the full series without any extras. There was a review that mentioned that Campbell was against the release of this show and Brisco on DVD--nothing could be further from the truth. He was probably referring to a money issue (or being sarcastic)and the haggling with Universal. Also, the show had such a small cult following I'm sure that impacted the release as well.
