The &#34;Who's on First?&#34; skit was almost sad but only the originals could have done it right. Buddy Hackett was really bad as Costello. He is a baaaaaad actor. Only Harvey Korman's Abbott made this movie watchable.,2,Hackett is a Baaaaaad actor,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,324,"['suppose', 'being', 'huge', 'fan', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'am', 'put', 'off', 'bad', 'reenactment', 'routines', '34', 'Who', 'First', '34', 'skit', 'was', 'almost', 'sad', 'only', 'originals', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'right', 'Buddy', 'Hackett', 'was', 'really', 'bad', 'Costello', 'baaaaaad', 'actor', 'Only', 'Harvey', 'Korman', 'Abbott', 'made', 'movie', 'watchable']",Bud & Lou: Comedy Is No Laughing Matter

1553040,ASDNRI9SDBJTB,B008H1Q5LC,Paul Manfredi,"[1, 2]","I watched this TV movie growing up and was anxious to finally see it again all these years later on DVD.  I really like both Harvey Korman and Buddy Hackett and they do good jobs as Abbott and Costello.  The movie starts a little slow but gets better after they become big stars and ends on a very sad note as the IRS enters the picture and audits the boys, causing them to lose their homes and money.  It's a sad ending to a great comedy team.  The only reason that I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 is because even though Korman and Hackett do a good job, they don't do so good recreating ""Who's on First?"" and other skits.  Buddy Hackett tries so hard to imitate Costello's voice during ""Who's on First?"" that the rapid fire routine is reduced to a very slow routine.  The comedy sketches were hard for me to watch because I know how fast Abbott and Costello delivered their lines.  That quickness is what made them so great and it's painful to watch it recreated at such a slow pace. Fortunately, not many of their skits are recreated. If you like Abbott and Costello, you should check this TV movie out.  Harvey Korman and Buddy Hackett do a good job.",4,Starts Slow; Gets Very Good!!,1350864000,"10 22, 2012",2012,1161,"['watched', 'TV', 'movie', 'growing', 'up', 'was', 'anxious', 'finally', 'see', 'again', 'years', 'later', 'DVD', 'really', 'Harvey', 'Korman', 'Buddy', 'Hackett', 'do', 'good', 'jobs', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'movie', 'little', 'slow', 'better', 'become', 'big', 'stars', 'very', 'sad', 'note', 'IRS', 'picture', 'boys', 'causing', 'lose', 'homes', 'money', 'sad', 'ending', 'great', 'comedy', 'team', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'because', 'even', 'Korman', 'Hackett', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'so', 'good', 'recreating', 'Who', 'First', 'other', 'skits', 'Buddy', 'Hackett', 'so', 'hard', 'imitate', 'Costello', 'voice', 'Who', 'First', 'rapid', 'fire', 'routine', 'reduced', 'very', 'slow', 'routine', 'comedy', 'sketches', 'were', 'hard', 'watch', 'know', 'how', 'fast', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'delivered', 'lines', 'quickness', 'what', 'made', 'so', 'great', 'painful', 'watch', 'recreated', 'slow', 'pace', 'Fortunately', 'not', 'many', 'skits', 'are', 'recreated', 'like', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'should', 'check', 'TV', 'movie', 'Harvey', 'Korman', 'Buddy', 'Hackett', 'do', 'good', 'job']",Bud & Lou: Comedy Is No Laughing Matter
