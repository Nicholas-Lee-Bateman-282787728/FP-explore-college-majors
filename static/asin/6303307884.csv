His daughter Virginia (Polly Ann Young) tries to keep the invisible Mrs. Kessler from the prying eyes of her boyfriend Ralph (John McGuire).

There is some good pacing by director Joseph H. Lewis so the story never lags in its meager 64 minutes. The cops don't seem as dumb as often portrayed in the programmers and when the plot takes a wild turn it doesn't seem hokey but simply part of the story.Lugosi's wife is thought dead but unbeknownst to him is actually being hidden away after a car crash left her mind a mess. He still loves her and pines for her in the house they lived in. His pretty daughter Virginia (Polly Ann Young) lives with him and is about to marry when her husband-to-be is arrested and convicted for one of the muders which have been occuring at the house.Lugosi, of course, is the real killer, going into a trance every time his wife sneaks out, and making it only as far as the house. The attractive maid who has the hots for Virginia's boyfriend gets it first, then the gardner. When Virginia's fiance pays the ultimate price for a crime he did not commit, his twin brother Paul (John McGuire) shows up and romance blooms between he and Virginia despite the murders.The cops are trying to figure out who could be doing the killings and Lugosi senses something may be terribly wrong when he awakens from a trance in his daughter's room. He comes to before anything horrible happens but begins to suspect the unthinkable.It's best not to ask how or why Lugosi's wife only gets loose at night or why her appearance sends him over the edge. This genre of ""B"" was only meant to be a fun distraction and it succeeds.

368556,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6303307884,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[1, 2]","As I write this review, there are at least ten, separate DVD releases for the film, The Invisible Ghost (1941), some double features, some stand alone releases, which is usually a good indicator that the movie has fallen into the public domain, meaning the original copyright for the film has since lapsed, and now anyone can broadcast or release the film, if they have the means.  The most famous case of this is Frank Capra's It's A Wonderful Life (1946).  Ever wonder why it's shown on every stinking channel all hours of the day and night during the holidays?  Well, it is a classic, but also none of the TV stations that broadcast it have to pay a penny to anyone for showing it...but I digress...written by Al and Helen Martin and directed by Joseph H. Lewis (Pride of the Bowery, The Mad Doctor of Market Street), The Invisible Ghost stars Bela Lugosi (Dracula, White Zombie), in one of a number of poverty row films he starred in during his `exile' from the major studio system.  Also appearing is Polly Ann Young (Murder on the Yukon), John McGuire (The Prisoner of Shark Island), Clarence Muse (Huckleberry Finn, Show Boat), Terry Walker (Dangerous Lady), Betty Compson (Mr. & Mrs. Smith), Ernie Adams (Pride of the Legion), and George Pembroke (Bluebeard).As the film begins we see Charles Kessler (Lugosi) sitting down to dinner alone...or is he?  He's seems to be having a conversation with the empty chair across from him (he even tells the butler to serve the empty chair first)...nutty, perhaps, but then we learn this is an annual event, marking Kessler's wedding anniversary, only Mrs. Kessler (Compson) is unable to attend due to the fact she ran off with another man some years ago, leaving behind Charles and their daughter Virginia (Young), and died in a subsequent car accident, or so is the common belief.  Well, turns out she ain't dead, but secretly stowed away in the cellar of the gardener's shack...why?  I had a hard time understanding (and I saw the film!), but it has something to do with her having amnesia.  Since her leaving there's been a rash of unexplained murders, which only happen at night, of the household staff (strangulations), but little in the way of clues as to the murderer.  Virginia's boyfriend Ralph (McGuire) makes the scene, just about the time the current maid gets it, who he apparently had a past history with, and now he's on the hot seat, fingered by the inept authorities for her death.  His brother Paul (also played by McGuire) shows up, and another person dies (the gardener), proving that, while good help may be hard to find, it's even harder to keep...from getting killed!  Things eventually come to a head during a dark and stormy night as those left try to get to the bottom of things...There really isn't much of a mystery here although it seems like the film was touted as such within the promotional material, as we know who the killer is fairly early into the film, along with the motive.  Another thing the film does not have, despite the title, is an actual ghost, which was disappointing as I do like a good ghost story, but whatever...given how much we know early on, there seems to be little in terms of the story to keep the audience interested, but the movie does have a few things going for it, like creepy atmosphere and Lugosi himself.  There's a scene in the film where Lugosi's character's in the maid's room, and the camera is positioned in such a way that it looks like he's coming at the audience.  He has a smile on his face, but it's not of the `Let's be friends' type...no, it's more of the sinister `I going to throttle the life out of you' type.  This, to me, was the highlight as few could pull off this kind of thing as well as he did.  Another interesting aspect with regards to the film was that of Clarence Muse's character of the African American butler Evans.  I was half expecting some sort of goofy, buffoonish, caricature prevalent in films about the time, but that wasn't the case here.  His character was actually a capable one, lacking any speech impediments, one that seemed to garner a certain amount of respect despite his position within the household.  Actually, Muse was quite an accomplished individual, holding a law degree, and thought of as a pioneer in the black theater movement.  As far as John McGuire playing the dual roles of the brothers Ralph and Paul Dickson, there wasn't, as far as I know, any mention of them being twins, but I think this was done because it was probably cheaper to just have one actor play both roles.  The one aspect that really stuck me as odd was the fact that while there were a number of murders in the house, no one within the house seemed all that put out by the fact a murderer was running around.  I don't know about you, but someone gets murdered in my house, I'll be commencing to freaking out...the characters seemed not so bothered that household servants were being knocked off (and the murderer may be lurking about), but more so by the inconvenience of having to fill another, vacant position.  Also, the story is filled with aspects that are the way they are only because they're written in the script that way, and not because they developed naturally.  All in all the good canceled out the bad, so I was left feeling pretty neutral by the end.  Had the movie not had Lugosi, I wouldn't have even bothered...I haven't seen all of Lugosi's poverty row films, but of the ones I have seen, White Zombie (1932), Bowery at Midnight (1942), and The Devil Bat (1940) are among the better ones, in my opinion.This Roan DVD release features a decent looking, fullscreen (1.33:1) picture, presented in its original aspect ratio.  The print does have plenty of flaws, but it is watchable.  The Dolby Digital mono audio comes through well enough.  There are a couple of extra features on the DVD, including a Cast & Credits listing, and text relating a little about the films background, which is also the same material print on the back of the DVD case.  As I said, there are at least ten different DVD releases of this film, and I couldn't speak towards the quality of these other releases, so buyer beware.Cookieman108",3,Death by smoking

368557,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6303307884,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 2]","Bela Lugosi was compelled to make a number of poor films during his down and out years, but 1941's Invisible Ghost should not be counted among them.  While this is the first of Bela's infamous ""Monogram Nine,"" it's actually a pretty interesting film, and one that allows Bela's star power to shine in several of its many facets.  This talented actor could be quite the charmer in the right cinematic environment, as he proved in Dracula, and the role of Charles Kessler in Invisible Ghost provided him with an opportunity to showcase the warm, genteel aspect of his nature alongside the legendary horror prowess that made him famous.  Of course, Kessler's a little bit odd - he does, after all, enjoy a serious dinner with his wife on the anniversary of their marriage, despite the fact that he has not seen her since she left him (and supposedly died) several years earlier - but he's a most sympathetic character with a wonderful daughter, a respected position in the community, and a most amiable personal nature.Unfortunately, Kessler's home is quickly becoming a house of horrors.  The first victim is the new maid, and her death complicates matters a great deal.  We the viewers know who killed her because we watched the murder as it happened.  Circumstantial evidence, however, leads the cops to charge Ralph Dickson (John McGuire), who just so happens to be the serious boyfriend of Kessler's daughter Virginia (Polly Ann Young), with this murder most foul.  As additional murders follow, you can only wonder who will be next and when the authorities will figure out what we already know - the true identity of the murderer.  You might think that your foreordained knowledge of the murderer would make Invisible Ghost a boring affair, but it really doesn't - largely thanks to Bela Lugosi's incredible performance (and a certain plot point I found rather shocking).Joseph H. Lewis also deserves a lot of credit for making this film rise above its B-movie origins.  As director, he maintains the gloomy atmosphere throughout, and he also gives us some unusual but wonderfully effective camera angles - including a truly memorable one through the flames of a fireplace.  The lighting also wonderfully accentuates the whole effect of several Bela Lugosi close-ups (and no one has ever done close-ups like Bela Lugosi did).  I will go so far as to tell you the butler didn't do it, but said butler (played by Clarence Muse) deserves special mention, as well.  Rather than serve as stereotypical grist for the Hollywood mill, this African-American character was presented with seriousness and respect - quite a rarity for films of this particular era.It's just unfortunate that the rest of Lugosi's films for Monogram lacked the kind of script and talent Invisible Ghost provided - this first of Lugosi's ""Monogram Nine"" is far and away the best of the lot.  I would place this high on the second tier of Lugosi's most impressive performances.",4,"The first and the best of Lugosi's ""Monogram Nine""",1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,2947,"['Bela', 'Lugosi', 'was', 'compelled', 'make', 'number', 'poor', 'films', 'down', 'years', '1941', 'Invisible', 'Ghost', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'counted', 'first', 'Bela', 'infamous', 'Monogram', 'Nine', 'actually', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'film', 'one', 'Bela', 'star', 'power', 'shine', 'several', 'many', 'facets', 'talented', 'actor', 'could', 'be', 'quite', 'charmer', 'right', 'cinematic', 'environment', 'proved', 'Dracula', 'role', 'Charles', 'Kessler', 'Invisible', 'Ghost', 'provided', 'opportunity', 'showcase', 'warm', 'genteel', 'aspect', 'nature', 'legendary', 'horror', 'prowess', 'made', 'famous', 'course', 'Kessler', 'little', 'bit', 'odd', 'enjoy', 'serious', 'dinner', 'wife', 'anniversary', 'marriage', 'fact', 'not', 'seen', 'left', 'supposedly', 'died', 'several', 'years', 'earlier', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'wonderful', 'daughter', 'respected', 'position', 'community', 'most', 'amiable', 'personal', 'nature.Unfortunately', 'Kessler', 'home', 'quickly', 'becoming', 'house', 'horrors', 'first', 'victim', 'new', 'maid', 'death', 'matters', 'great', 'deal', 'viewers', 'know', 'who', 'killed', 'watched', 'murder', 'happened', 'Circumstantial', 'evidence', 'however', 'cops', 'charge', 'Ralph', 'Dickson', 'John', 'McGuire', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'serious', 'boyfriend', 'Kessler', 'daughter', 'Virginia', 'Polly', 'Ann', 'Young', 'murder', 'most', 'foul', 'additional', 'murders', 'follow', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'next', 'when', 'authorities', 'will', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'already', 'know', 'true', 'identity', 'murderer', 'might', 'think', 'foreordained', 'knowledge', 'murderer', 'would', 'make', 'Invisible', 'Ghost', 'boring', 'affair', 'really', ""n't"", 'largely', 'thanks', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'incredible', 'performance', 'certain', 'plot', 'point', 'found', 'rather', 'shocking', '.Joseph', 'H.', 'Lewis', 'also', 'lot', 'credit', 'making', 'film', 'rise', 'B-movie', 'origins', 'director', 'gloomy', 'atmosphere', 'also', 'unusual', 'wonderfully', 'effective', 'camera', 'including', 'truly', 'memorable', 'one', 'flames', 'fireplace', 'lighting', 'also', 'wonderfully', 'whole', 'effect', 'several', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'close-ups', 'one', 'ever', 'done', 'close-ups', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'did', 'will', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'tell', 'butler', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'said', 'butler', 'played', 'Clarence', 'Muse', 'special', 'mention', 'as', 'well', 'Rather', 'serve', 'stereotypical', 'grist', 'Hollywood', 'mill', 'African-American', 'character', 'was', 'presented', 'seriousness', 'respect', 'quite', 'rarity', 'films', 'particular', 'era.It', 'just', 'unfortunate', 'rest', 'Lugosi', 'films', 'Monogram', 'lacked', 'kind', 'script', 'talent', 'Invisible', 'Ghost', 'provided', 'first', 'Lugosi', 'Monogram', 'Nine', 'far', 'away', 'best', 'lot', 'would', 'place', 'high', 'second', 'tier', 'Lugosi', 'most', 'impressive', 'performances']",Invisible Ghost VHS
368558,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,6303307884,Dave. K,"[3, 6]","Invisible Ghost was released in 1941 10-years after Bela Lugosi became a star on the rise starring as Count Dracula in the horror classic Dracula. Fact of the matter is Lugosi never really fully capitalized on the success of Dracula and while his career did sort of go downhill after Dracula he was still making movies under Universal and having a pretty good career, but he never had a character quite as Iconic as Dracula. He starred in quite a few movies with Boris Karloff in the 30s, but around the 40s is when Lugosi hit Poverty Row, which was a slang for low budget studios.As much as I love Bela Lugosi for me Boris Karloff is the king of the horror genre, but even for those who prefer Lugosi his career never quite took off like Karloff's and let's be honest; Lugosi was a better actor than given credit for, but he doesn't have the range Karloff did. By the time of the release of Invisible Ghost, Lugosi was starting to hit hard times. He did star in a few movies for major studios, but in general he was reduced to a small role that was beneath him and in a lot of the movies it was a role that essentially any actor could have played. Lugosi appeared in the RKO release of The Body Snatcher with Boris Karloff in 1945 and by this time when Lugosi had a role in a movie under a major studio it was either a cameo or in the case of The Body Snatcher he was just sort of there and had no lines at all or in this case very little dialogue. So that shows you how Bela Lugosi went from this greatness to struggling for roles, which was really quite a shame.Even when Bela Lugosi would get a starring role in a movie by the likes of Universal like The Ghost of Frankenstein, by that point the series was now seen as a B-movie rather than an A, but even with a movie like Ghost of Frankenstein being seen as a B movie it's still light-years ahead of Poverty Row. Despite the fact Lugosi was reduced to Poverty Row he was still making some enjoyable movies. The best way to describe this movie for a modern audience is if there had been VHS and or DVDs Invisible Ghost would have been a movie that went DTV.The screenplay by Al & Helen Martin is quite poor; while not the worst script out there it was poor with weak characters and an even weaker plot. Nothing is explained plot wise and the characters were rather boring. Lugosi plays Charles Kessler and we find out his wife left him for another man we also find out she was in a car accident and the guy died, but she lived. For some reason the Gardner keeps her hidden and she sometimes wanders off and when Kessler sees her he becomes hypnotized and kills people.The reason the Gardner keeps her hidden is he doesn't want Kessler to see what she's become since it seems she has some brain damage. Wow great explanation. And why exactly does Kessler become hypnotized and go on a killing spree? Well your guess is as good as mine. Truth is by a certain point of the movie I wasn't really paying full attention so if a reason was given I must have missed it. The biggest flaw with the movie is we know Kessler is the killer and it take away from the movie.And what I find funny is people are being killed in the house and yet not one person suspects anyone else and nobody bothers to lock their doors. I don't know about you, but if people in my house are being killed I'm gonna be suspicious of the other people and make sure my door is locked. Invisible Ghost really is just an idiotic movie.Director Joseph H. Lewis fails at brining any suspense or any tension. In fairness he doesn't much to work with. Making something out of this script would be no easy task. But the one good thing I can say is the actors aren't half bad. For such a low budget flick the acting wasn't bad well some of the actors were poor, but some were fairly decent. But even with that Joseph H. Lewis never is able to get much going.Over the years the horror genre has had many great suspenseful and scary movies, but there's just something about horror from the 30s and 40s that has never been captured again. These movies often had this really eerie look that was loaded with atmosphere and again over the years many horror flicks have had that, but not like they did in the 30s and 40s, but Invisible Ghost really has none of that at all.Many have called Invisible Ghost the so bad its good movie and I suppose you can make a case for that, but for me this was just so bad it's well bad. There are moments that are fun in how bad they are, but in general I was just bored. Invisible Ghost only runs at about 65-minutes, but personally it felt a lot longer. It's quite a shame Bela Lugosi got stuck making movies like this and it would get even worse for him in the 50s. To go from starring in Dracula and movies along side Boris Karloff is a huge drop in the acting food chain.I can see how this movie would appeal to some viewers, but for me it was just mostly a waste. You can find so many better horror flicks from this era that it's best to just skip this. The only reason to watch it is if you are a big Lugosi fan like I am. Lugosi was excellent, but he has such lousy material to work with there's only so much he can do.",2,Poor Bela,1229040000,"12 12, 2008",2008,5167,"['Invisible', 'Ghost', 'was', 'released', '1941',

368564,A1BA72K4VK1UN1,6303307884,"Patrick W. Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[0, 1]","4  stars for genre devotees.This movie would have easily achieved five stars, (targeted specifically, of course, at black-and-white B-horror film fans like me), except for the fact that this flick ends pretty abruptly, catching viewers a bit off-guard. It's as if some assertive studio bean-counter waltzed into the movie set and informed the director, midway through the film, that his budget for this one had just been slashed. It's not a hateful finale but I was surprised at the lack of traditional ceremony near the end and viewers will additionally notice that this 1941 movie is a bit abbreviated at sixty-four minutes, (not all that uncommon for the genre.)THE STORY: (The setting) Mysterious murders have been occurring in the neighborhood of Mr. Charles Kessler (Bela Lugosi), amiable patriarch of a moderate estate.Kessler's lovely daughter, Virginia, is about to be affianced to a promising young man, Ralph Dickson, who had once involved himself in a previous tryst with a young lass who had since gone to work as Mr. Kessler's flashy and concupiscent house maid, Cecile Mannix (played by Terry Walker), all this history being unknown to Virginia and others in the household. This is one domestic gal who is not going to be put off by Dickson's desire for a new love -- she confronts him with the issue but he is not in the least inclined to take her back.Mr. Kessler himself is a bit wacky: his wife had run off with her paramour a couple years before. The amorous two were soon thereafter involved in a spectacular car crash and it was believed that they were both instantly killed. But unbeknownst to all but Kessler's Gardener, Jules Mason and his wife Mrs. Mason, Mrs. Kessler had actually survived and had since been kept alive, housed, and secured in a secret basement cell of Jules' gardening shed. Maintaining a belief that his wife was dead, (whom he unexplainably still loved), Mr. Kessler engages in speaking directly to an empty chair each year on their wedding anniversary as if she was there dining across the table from him.[The plot thickens!] Lugosi freaks out at times when he inadvertently spots his wife on the grounds, (she intermittently overcomes Jules' clearly inadequate security precautions and goes out strolling in her night-clothes), and he falls into a sort of trance, effecting a Frankenstein-ish, arms-extended gait when this happens. As a result of his mesmerized condition, he stalks into the maid's room and strangles her, (and thus, the viewer learns who's been pulling off all the nasty murders in the neighborhood!)This particular murder generates two items of relevance for the young fianc&eacute;, Ralph Dickson: 1. his problem concerning the maid's extortion becomes moot, and; 2. he immediately becomes the chief suspect in her murder since the butler, Evans (artfully played by Clarence Muse), had overheard an argument between them and was triggered to reveal this fact to the police when questioned. Poor Ralph is subsequently arrested, convicted, and executed! But soon thereafter, Ralph's identical twin, Paul Dickson, shows up to look into the accusations against his now-dead brother and he's taken in by the Kesslers as a welcome house guest.Lugosi spots his wife on the grounds again and this time he strangles Jules - but Jules revives for just a moment after all others thought he was dead, only to look up and see the faces of both his wife and Kessler hovering over him. It's a very edifying moment when Kessler tasks him: ""Jules..! Did you recognize the man who tried to kill you?!?"" Ha! Jules' eyes bulge a bit, he sucks in his breath at the image of Kessler, and THEN he conks out for good.So what happens next? A new cook is hired, (Mr. Kessler experiences difficulties in keeping domestic help), Kessler spots his wife again, and then guess what? You'll have to watch the movie to find out as I'm stopping here to avoid spoilers. That's the oddest part about this movie - it takes forever to set up the plot scenario and then it closes out quite hurriedly.One aspect of this film which I especially treasured was the casting of Clarence Muse in the role of Mr. Kessler's butler, Evans. He has a notably major speaking role here and his delivery, as always, was stellar. Muse often provided comic relief as he did inSherlock Holmes in Washingtonwhere he played George the Porter in an uncredited but key role. He could also play more serious parts as he did in this instance and also where he was cast as a tribal official in the terrific old jungle serial:Jungle Queen. Muse possessed a particular talent for conveying great dignity as a domestic worker or, in other period stereotypical African-American film roles.In summary, I award this Lugosi landmark movie a high ranking among its peer films but be prepared for the lightning-quick ending.",4,A notably more complex plot than most Lugosi films (details),1268524800,"03 14, 2010",2010,4820,"['4', 'stars', 'genre',

Even so, Bela is devoted to her memory, and obsesses in grief.  When the fickle spouse returns by night, she stands alive and silent beneath Bela's window.  Under her hypnotic spell, he falls into a trance, and commits murder.  Sound confusing?  Join the club.  Among other things, the woman's mysterious power over Bela is not explained.  Lugosi's poverty row horror thrillers are best for fanatic cheap horror fans.  (Count me as one of these).  The script and other production values put low budget limits on one's viewing pleasure.  At least the DVD is more technically tolerable than the low grade VHS tape that previously haunted our movie shelf.  The dark and stormy night in the old mansion is an overworked cliche that is still fun to watch.  Bela is only passively menacing in this one.  He is a pawn, and not the instigator.  This is a change from the usual mad doctor tampering in God's Domain.  The other cast adequately goes through the motions.  It's an agreeable way to spend 60+ minutes.;-)",3,"Confusing script, but fun for Lugosi fans.",1080864000,"04 2, 2004",2004,1094,"['are', 'told', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'wife', 'died', 'car', 'wreck', 'fleeing', 'lover', 'Even', 'so', 'Bela', 'devoted', 'memory', 'obsesses', 'grief', 'When', 'fickle', 'spouse', 'returns', 'night', 'alive', 'silent', 'beneath', 'Bela', 'window', 'hypnotic', 'spell', 'trance', 'commits', 'murder', 'confusing', 'Join', 'club', 'other', 'things', 'woman', 'mysterious', 'power', 'Bela', 'not', 'explained', 'Lugosi', 'poverty', 'row', 'horror', 'thrillers', 'are', 'best', 'fanatic', 'cheap', 'horror', 'fans', 'Count', 'one', 'script', 'other', 'production', 'values', 'put', 'low', 'budget', 'limits', 'one', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'least', 'DVD', 'more', 'technically', 'tolerable', 'low', 'grade', 'VHS', 'tape', 'previously', 'haunted', 'movie', 'shelf', 'dark', 'stormy', 'night', 'old', 'mansion', 'overworked', 'cliche', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'Bela', 'only', 'passively', 'menacing', 'one', 'pawn', 'not', 'instigator', 'change', 'usual', 'mad', 'doctor', 'tampering', 'God', 'Domain', 'other', 'cast', 'adequately', 'motions', 'agreeable', 'way', 'spend', '60+', 'minutes']",Invisible Ghost VHS

On their anniversary, he still has the butler set a place for her at the dinner table, even having him serve the empty spot. Unknown to him, his wife was actually in a car accident and has been hidden away and cared for by Kessler's Gardener Jules and his wife. But Mrs. Kessler, now an amnesiac, sneaks out at night and stares up at the window of her husband's study. Kessler immediatelt seems to know when she is down there and goes to stare back at her. Then something happens...Kessler becomes hypnotized and immediately sets off to commit murder. Beeing entranced, Kessler isn't even aware what he is doing.Several murders have already taken place at the estate and as the film opens, He ventures forth and murders the new maid in her bed. The fiancee of Kessler's daughter, one Ralph Dickson is accused of the crime since he and the maid had once been lovers. Dickson is found guilty on the most circumstantial evidence and is executed. Soon after, Dickson's twin brother Paul shows up at the Kessler estate to try and find out what happened to his brother and learns about the mysterious deaths. When he asks why they don't leave the house he's told that Kessler is waiting for his wife to return.Invisible Ghost was a mere hook for a title as Kessler's wife is no ghost and not remotely invisible...dead or otherwise. But remember this was 1941 and truth in advertising was not order of the day. Lugosi plays a more tragic role here, not the menacing evil of other films like Dracula or White Zombie. He seems to be truly in love with his or maybe obsessed is a better word. His deliberate stalking of his victims, creeping up from behind or as they sleep is just fun to watch.There doesn't seem to have been any reason for Paul Dickson to be an exact twin of Ralph's, as nothing was made of this fact outside of the initial reaction of Kessler's daughter, Virgina.A good Role for Bela, one where he was the real murderer as opposed the red herring he would play in many other films.",4,A TORMENTED PERFORMANCE BY BELA,1119571200,"06 24, 2005",2005,2071,"['Bela', 'Charles', 'Kessler', 'wife', 'ran', 'off', 'left', 'several', 'years', 'earlier', 'anniversary', 'still', 'butler', 'set', 'place', 'dinner', 'table', 'even', 'having', 'serve', 'empty', 'spot', 'Unknown', 'wife', 'was', 'actually', 'car', 'accident', 'been', 'hidden', 'away', 'cared', 'Kessler', 'Gardener', 'Jules', 'wife', 'Mrs.', 'Kessler', 'now', 'amnesiac', 'out', 'night', 'up', 'window', 'husband', 'study', 'Kessler', 'immediatelt', 'know', 'when', 'down', 'there', 'stare', 'back', 'Then', 'something', 'happens', 'Kessler', 'hypnotized', 'immediately', 'sets', 'commit', 'murder', 'Beeing', 'entranced', 'Kessler', ""n't"", 'even', 'aware', 'what', 'doing.Several', 'murders', 'have', 'already', 'taken', 'place', 'estate', 'film', 'ventures', 'forth', 'new', 'maid', 'bed', 'fiancee', 'Kessler', 'daughter', 'one', 'Ralph', 'Dickson', 'accused', 'crime', 'maid', 'had', 'once', 'been', 'lovers', 'Dickson', 'found', 'guilty', 'most', 'circumstantial', 'evidence', 'executed', 'Soon', 'Dickson', 'twin', 'brother', 'Paul', 'up', 'Kessler', 'estate', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'brother', 'mysterious', 'deaths', 'When', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'house', 'told', 'Kessler', 'waiting', 'wife', 'return.Invisible', 'Ghost', 'was', 'mere', 'hook', 'title', 'Kessler', 'wife', 'ghost', 'not', 'remotely', 'invisible', 'dead', 'otherwise', 'remember', 'was', '1941', 'truth', 'advertising', 'was', 'not', 'order', 'day', 'Lugosi', 'more', 'tragic', 'role', 'here', 'not', 'menacing', 'evil', 'other', 'films', 'Dracula', 'White', 'Zombie', 'be', 'truly', 'love', 'maybe', 'obsessed', 'better', 'word', 'deliberate', 'stalking', 'victims', 'creeping', 'up', 'behind', 'sleep', 'just', 'fun', 'watch.There', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'reason', 'Paul', 'Dickson', 'be', 'exact', 'twin', 'Ralph', 'nothing', 'was', 'made', 'fact', 'initial', 'reaction', 'Kessler', 'daughter', 'Virgina.A', 'good', 'Role', 'Bela', 'one', 'where', 'was', 'real', 'murderer', 'opposed', 'red', 'herring', 'would', 'play', 'many', 'other', 'films']",Invisible Ghost VHS

This one was near the top of the heap...along with Bowery at Midnight, though I prefer the latter, which had a more coherent plot and more interesting supporting players.  What's interesting about Invisible Ghost is Bela's opportunity to display a lot of facial expressions and sort of a split personality.  Excellent support was provided by Clarence Muse in an unusual, non-stereotypical character for a black performer in such a vintage part.  Bela and Clarence managed to put lipstick on a pig, given the ""C-grade"" script and plot, with some help from the director Joseph Lewis.
