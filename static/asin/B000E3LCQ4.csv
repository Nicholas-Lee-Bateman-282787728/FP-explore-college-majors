967584,A3M55PGC9RH0DI,B000E3LCQ4,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]",At last an Al Kooper dvd!!! Mind you this is really a band dvd as opposed to a solo release. Al shares the vocal spotlight with Jimmy Vivino and for the first half of the show is content to sit back and let the band do the talking. As a long-time Kooper fan my only regret (don't get me wrong I am very thankful for this dvd!) is that there aren't more Al songs. I'm hoping that this will lead to more releases. It would be great to see Al with a bigger band (Al and a brass section sorta go hand in hand) and doing more solo songs but this will definitely do for now. Highspots? Many. Coming Back In Cadillac is great but my favourite is I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know. When Al plays the Green Onions riff he hits a groove that you have to hear to believe. Al's keyboard playing is excellent as to be expected but also a special mention to Mike Merritt on bass who never puts a foot wrong and of course the brilliant Jimmy Vivino. Anton Fig keeps the beat steady and is very reliable. All in all a great band performance.If you're a Kooper fan do not hesitate just buy it. If you're a blues fan ditto. If you're a music fan ditto again. Buy this dvd I assure you you won't regret it for a second.,5,More please Al!!!,1146614400,"05 3, 2006",2006,1204,"['last', 'Al', 'Kooper', 'dvd', 'Mind', 'really', 'band', 'dvd', 'opposed', 'solo', 'release', 'Al', 'shares', 'vocal', 'spotlight', 'Jimmy', 'Vivino', 'first', 'half', 'show', 'content', 'sit', 'back', 'let', 'band', 'do', 'talking', 'long-time', 'Kooper', 'fan', 'only', 'regret', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'am', 'very', 'thankful', 'dvd', 'are', ""n't"", 'more', 'Al', 'songs', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'will', 'lead', 'more', 'releases', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'see', 'Al', 'bigger', 'band', 'Al', 'brass', 'section', 'sorta', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'doing', 'more', 'solo', 'songs', 'will', 'definitely', 'do', 'now', 'Highspots', 'Many', 'Coming', 'Back', 'Cadillac', 'great', 'favourite', 'Love', 'More', ""'ll"", 'Ever', 'Know', 'When', 'Al', 'Green', 'Onions', 'riff', 'groove', 'have', 'hear', 'believe', 'Al', 'keyboard', 'playing', 'excellent', 'be', 'expected', 'also', 'special', 'mention', 'Mike', 'Merritt', 'bass', 'who', 'never', 'foot', 'wrong', 'course', 'brilliant', 'Jimmy', 'Vivino', 'Anton', 'Fig', 'beat', 'steady', 'very', 'reliable', 'great', 'band', 'performance.If', ""'re"", 'Kooper', 'fan', 'do', 'not', 'hesitate', 'just', 'buy', ""'re"", 'blues', 'fan', 'ditto', ""'re"", 'music', 'fan', 'ditto', 'again', 'Buy', 'dvd', 'assure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'second']",N/A

I watch it fairly often and really enjoy it.  But if you are considering this purchase, there are a couple of things you should be aware of.First, it's fairly short, which is OK, but considering that many of the songs are rather long, means there isn't a whole lot of material.  I don't know if the actual concert ran longer and was cut, but if that's the case, I wish that it was included in its entirety.  Also, there are cutaways from the actual performance to band interviews.  I would rather have the performances uninterrupted and the interviews available as a separate menu item...but they didn't ask me.Also, the sound is OK, but it's just stereo and needs a lot of power from your amp to get a decent listening level.  I wish it was in DTS surround, which would give a lot more punch and presence.Finally, it is really a band DVD, not an Al Kooper DVD.  Jimmy Vivano takes a lot of vocals and guitar leads.  I'm not complaining; Vivano does well, but, combined with the brevity of the DVD, it does mean there's not many Kooper songs.If your a Kooper fan, you obviously have to have this in your collection.  I'm just trying to prepare you for what you'll actually experience.",4,"Great to have an Al Kooper DVD, but...",1216166400,"07 16, 2008",2008,1291,"[""'ve"", 'owned', 'DVD', 'year', 'now', 'great', 'finally', 'have', 'video', 'performance', 'Al', 'Kooper', 'watch', 'fairly', 'often', 'really', 'enjoy', 'are', 'considering', 'purchase', 'are', 'couple', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'of.First', 'fairly', 'short', 'OK', 'considering', 'many', 'songs', 'are', 'rather', 'long', 'means', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'material', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'actual', 'concert', 'ran', 'longer', 'was', 'cut', 'case', 'wish', 'was', 'included', 'entirety', 'Also', 'are', 'cutaways', 'actual', 'performance', 'band', 'interviews', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'performances', 'uninterrupted', 'interviews', 'available', 'separate', 'menu', 'item', 'did', ""n't"", 'ask', 'me.Also', 'sound', 'OK', 'just', 'stereo', 'lot', 'power', 'amp', 'get', 'decent', 'listening', 'level', 'wish', 'was', 'DTS', 'surround', 'would', 'give', 'lot', 'more', 'punch', 'presence.Finally', 'really', 'band', 'DVD', 'not', 'Al', 'Kooper', 'DVD', 'Jimmy', 'Vivano', 'lot', 'vocals', 'guitar', 'leads', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining', 'Vivano', 'well', 'combined', 'brevity', 'DVD', 'mean', 'not', 'many', 'Kooper', 'songs.If', 'Kooper', 'fan', 'obviously', 'have', 'have', 'collection', ""'m"", 'just', 'trying', 'prepare', 'what', ""'ll"", 'actually', 'experience']",N/A
967586,A12S5XTMAHYYME,B000E3LCQ4,Perry Celestino,"[3, 3]","Well I met Al Kooper in Central Park at the end of the Blues Project days. This DVD is very interesting. There is very little material released on this great artist. He is featured a bit in Dylan's No Direction Home and has an awful version of ""Wake Me Shake Me"" on the Monterey Outtakes set. But this is different, a jam with studio musicians-who can be-as mentioned in previous reviews- a bit sterile. But in this instance it seems to work. The song selection is good and they go through Blues, Rock and Soul in this one hour set. Vocals are shared by Jimmy Vivino who has a typical East Coast delivery and Al who mostly does his own tunes in his laid back style (with Ray Bans on!)However, this is an interesting DVD. The version of Glamour Girl (T-Bone Walker)is great a highlight of the show. Jimmy Vivino (who has appeared also in an interesting Blues instructional DVD with Hubert Sumlin) does a very credible job on his Les Paul and Al's solos are great. Al's laid back vocals, as he always does, are interesting as he is not a great singer-but he gets his message across. The highlight of this DVD has to be ""I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know""--it's worth the price of the whole DVD- probably Al's best song ever and the medley with ""Green Onions"" and ""Whiter Shade of Pale"" just adds to it.I bought this DVD in Australia about six months ago and cannot stop playing it. It has tunes from his whole career except the Blues Project days--which I really loved. I wish he'd done ""I Can't Keep From Crying"". I would have loved to see him play with Danny Kalb, once a rising star guitarist who was eclipsed by Mike Bloomfield in the late sixties, and of course Bloomfield went on to play on the ""Super Session"" album, oh well. The Project bassist Larry Kohlberg has passed away too.I think this set is an interesting addition to one's DVD library. Those of us that enjoyed the first ""Blood Sweat And Tears"" LP, ""Projections"" and ""Super Session"" will not be disappointed. It's a Jam like all of Al's best work.",5,Al Kooper Plays His Stuff With Studio Musicians,1174694400,"03 24, 2007",2007,2017,"['Well', 'met', 'Al', 'Kooper', 'Central', 'Park', 'end', 'Blues', 'Project', 'days', 'DVD', 'very', 'interesting', 'very', 'little', 'material', 'released', 'great', 'artist', 'featured', 'bit', 'Dylan', 'No', 'Direction', 'Home', 'awful', 'version', 'Wake', 'Me', 'Shake', 'Me', 'Monterey', 'Outtakes', 'set', 'different', 'jam', 'studio', 'musicians-who', 'can', 'be-as', 'mentioned', 'previous', 'reviews-', 'bit', 'sterile', 'instance', 'work', 'song', 'selection', 'good', 'go', 'Blues', 'Rock', 'Soul', 'one', 'hour', 'set', 'Vocals', 'are', 'shared', 'Jimmy', 'Vivino', 'who', 'typical', 'East', 'Coast', 'delivery', 'Al', 'who', 'mostly', 'own', 'tunes', 'laid', 'back', 'style', 'Ray', 'Bans', 'However', 'interesting', 'DVD', 'version', 'Glamour', 'Girl', 'T-Bone', 'Walker', 'great', 'highlight', 'show', 'Jimmy', 'Vivino', 'who', 'appeared', 'also', 'interesting', 'Blues', 'instructional', 'DVD', 'Hubert', 'Sumlin', 'very', 'credible', 'job', 'Les', 'Paul', 'Al', 'solos', 'are', 'great', 'Al', 'laid', 'back', 'vocals', 'always', 'are', 'interesting', 'not', 'great', 'singer-but', 'message', 'highlight', 'DVD', 'be', 'Love', 'More', ""'ll"", 'Ever', 'Know', 'price', 'whole', 'DVD-', 'probably', 'Al', 'best', 'song', 'ever', 'medley', 'Green', 'Onions', 'Whiter', 'Shade', 'Pale', 'just', 'it.I', 'DVD', 'Australia', 'six', 'months', 'ago', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'playing', 'tunes', 'whole', 'career', 'Blues', 'Project', 'days', 'really', 'loved', 'wish', ""'d"", 'done', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Keep', 'Crying', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'play', 'Danny', 'Kalb', 'once', 'rising', 'star', 'guitarist', 'who', 'was', 'eclipsed', 'Mike', 'Bloomfield', 'late', 'sixties', 'course', 'Bloomfield', 'went', 'play', 'Super', 'Session', 'album', 'oh', 'well', 'Project', 'bassist', 'Larry', 'Kohlberg', 'passed', 'away', 'too.I', 'think', 'set', 'interesting', 'addition', 'one', 'DVD', 'library', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'Blood', 'Sweat', 'Tears', 'LP', 'Projections', 'Super', 'Session', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Jam', 'Al', 'best', 'work']",N/A
