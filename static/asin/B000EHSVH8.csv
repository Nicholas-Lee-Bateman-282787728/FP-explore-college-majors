973500,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,B000EHSVH8,Genevieve Hayes,"[1, 2]","Rock n Roll High School Forever - Broadly, this film is about a group of rebellious teenagers, led by Corey Feldman (wearing clothes that look like they were stolen from Michael Jackson), who seek to reclaim their high school from the evil Vice Principal, Dr. Vader, through practical jokes and rock n roll. However, it took me most of this film's 95 minute duration to figure that out. What this film really is, is a series of semi-connected episodes featuring either Feldman and his friends playing pranks or Feldman and his band singing. Although, as a whole, the film is a bit of a disjointed mess, the individual episodes are pretty funny (my favourite was a scene in which one of the character is meant to give a book review of ""Heart of Darkness"" and instead described ""Apocalypse Now""), and the songs are good toe-tapping tunes (many sung by Feldman himself) that make me wish that a soundtrack had been released.For those who have seen the original ""Rock n Roll High School"", the connections between these two films are slight, and the original film is by far the superior of the two, which may lead to some disappointment. However, if you try to see this as a stand-alone film in its own right, then you will probably enjoy it a lot more - 3 stars.South Beach Academy - This film about two brothers: one of whom must save his uncle's beach academy from being lost in a bet over a game of beach volley ball; the other (played by Corey Feldman) whose main goal in life is to lose his virginity; is just one big excuse for virtually non-stop nudity. Most of the film takes place either on the beach, where women are constantly walking around topless, or in a strip-club, where Feldman spends most of his time acting like a sleaze. Presumably the makers of this film thought that all of the faults in this film's script could be hidden behind naked women, and there are a lot of faults in the script. This is a boring, unfunny, waste of time that becomes sleazier and sleazier with each passing minute.By the time this film was made, Feldman had ceased to be the lovable teen actor and is actually quite revolting. One scene, in particular, in which his character has a pornographic fantasy in the strip club, makes him seem incredibly creepy. I would say that this film is only for fans of Feldman, but even they might prefer to give this one a miss - 1 star.",2,Worth it for Rock n Roll High School Forever,1236038400,"03 3, 2009",2009,2366,"['Rock', 'Roll', 'High', 'School', 'Forever', 'Broadly', 'film', 'group', 'rebellious', 'teenagers', 'led', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'wearing', 'clothes', 'look', 'were', 'stolen', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'who', 'seek', 'reclaim', 'high', 'school', 'evil', 'Vice', 'Principal', 'Dr.', 'Vader', 'practical', 'jokes', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'However', 'took', 'most', 'film', '95', 'minute', 'duration', 'figure', 'out', 'What', 'film', 'really', 'series', 'semi-connected', 'episodes', 'featuring', 'Feldman', 'friends', 'playing', 'pranks', 'Feldman', 'band', 'singing', 'whole', 'film', 'bit', 'disjointed', 'mess', 'individual', 'episodes', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'favourite', 'was', 'scene', 'one', 'character', 'meant', 'give', 'book', 'review', 'Heart', 'Darkness', 'instead', 'described', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'songs', 'are', 'good', 'toe-tapping', 'tunes', 'many', 'sung', 'Feldman', 'make', 'wish', 'soundtrack', 'had', 'been', 'released.For', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'High', 'School', 'connections', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'slight', 'original', 'film', 'far', 'superior', 'two', 'may', 'lead', 'disappointment', 'However', 'try', 'see', 'stand-alone', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'lot', 'more', '3', 'stars.South', 'Beach', 'Academy', 'film', 'two', 'brothers', 'one', 'whom', 'must', 'save', 'uncle', 'beach', 'academy', 'being', 'lost', 'bet', 'game', 'beach', 'volley', 'ball', 'other', 'played', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'main', 'goal', 'life', 'lose', 'virginity', 'just', 'one', 'big', 'excuse', 'virtually', 'non-stop', 'nudity', 'Most', 'film', 'place', 'either', 'beach', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'constantly', 'walking', 'around', 'topless', 'strip-club', 'where', 'Feldman', 'most', 'time', 'acting', 'sleaze', 'Presumably', 'makers', 'film', 'thought', 'faults', 'film', 'script', 'could', 'be', 'hidden', 'naked', 'women', 'are', 'lot', 'faults', 'script', 'boring', 'unfunny', 'waste', 'time', 'sleazier', 'sleazier', 'passing', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Feldman', 'had', 'ceased', 'be', 'lovable', 'teen', 'actor', 'actually', 'quite', 'revolting', 'One', 'scene', 'particular', 'character', 'pornographic', 'fantasy', 'strip', 'club', 'seem', 'incredibly', 'creepy', 'would', 'say', 'film', 'only', 'fans', 'Feldman', 'even', 'might', 'prefer', 'give', 'one', 'miss', '1', 'star']",Rock N'roll High/s.

I was so suprised to find ""Rock and Roll High School Forever"" along with another film as a Red Carpet Double Feature brand new and factory sealed for a measly $3.99 at a Bi Lo store when I was visiting SC,I bought it in a heartbeat! I had RNRHSF on VHS a while back and it got eaten(oh the horror!)Well it got it on crystal clear DVD,with even another Corey Feldman movie,South Beach Academy,this is pretty standard T&A fare,with some great acting talent behind it,something you would see on HBO late at night,not something I would watch more than once! Both films are presented Full Frame buts thats more than likely the way they were filmed.Rock and Roll High School Forever stars Corey Feldman,Sarah Buxton,Mojo Nixon,the great late Larry Linville,and cult queen Mary Woronov as Vader,she was in the original Rock N Roll High School in a very somilar role as Togar,a very underated actress! South Beach Academy also stars Feldman along with cult actors James Hong and the great late Al Lewis,FYI former adult film star Ron Jeremy appears also under different name.

It looks obvious South Beach Academy would be the double feature because Corey Feldman was also in it.R&R; HS Forever may not have measured up to the original that is now a movie classic, but what drew me, and still does, is just how catchy the music was with Feldman and the Eradicators.  I'll admit, Feldman looked like he was trying to channel the now infamous Michael Jackson during his Black/White days, but the group as a whole was great to listen to.  I heard a soundtrack was suppose to have been released to coincide with the movie, but Feldman got in some trouble, and the plan was scrapped.
