1520016,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B006UI5ARY,Annie Van Auken,"[32, 34]","I was 7 when this classic comedy debuted. Because of its night (school tomorrow!) and starting time (go to bed!!), I never got a chance to see it in first run..CAR 54, WHERE ARE YOU? ran for two seasons, Sunday 8:30 to 9 pm on NBC-TV. Filming was on location and at the pioneer BIOGRAPH studio, a Bronx fixture since 1913. The TV drama NAKED CITY was a Biograph production, as wereBUTTERFIELD 8(1960), ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW (1959) andPRETTY BOY FLOYD(1960). The shuttered studio was destroyed by a 1980 fire and renovated as an apartment complex..Created by Nat Hiken (of ""Sgt. Bilko"" fame), ""Car 54"" was one of the first integrated shows on TV. Set in a fictional precinct (the 53rd), its main characters are a Mutt & Jeff team of uniformed cops. Diminutive Officer Toody is brash, pushy and a bit slow on the uptake; he has a domineering wife. Officer Muldoon is very tall, introverted and somewhat brighter than his partner; he lives with his mom.Season Two had a female officer (Lisa Loughlin) for one episode. Another part-timer, Mickey Deems, was originally a drummer and arranger. He appeared in an off-Broadway musical with Hal Linden (""Anything Goes"") and as half of a slapstick comedy team in over 200 ""Mack & Myer"" one-reelers. Linden (akaBARNEY MILLER) is also here, as an asst. DA.Notable guests:Kenny Delmar was Fred Allen's announcer and Sen. Claghorn on radio's ""Allen's Alley."" John Alexander played Uncle Teddy on Broadway and in the film adaptation ofARSENIC AND OLD LACE(1944). Molly Picon was a star of Yiddish theater and vaudeville. Larry Storch was Cpl. Agarn on TV'sF TROOP. Katherine Helmond was a regular onSOAPand WHO'S THE BOSS? Margaret Hamilton was Dorothy's nemesis inTHE WIZARD OF OZ(1939). Jules Munshin appeared in several MGM musicals. Herschel Bernardi voiced hipster ""Charlie the tuna"" in STARKIST TV ads. Joe E. Marks was Pappy Yokum in the LI'L ABNER (1959) movie musical and played Smee in NBC's Mary Martin version of PETER PAN (1960). Kenneth Mars is the zany playwright in Mel Brooks'THE PRODUCERS(1968). Jack Gilford was Doc Daneeka inCATCH-22(1970). Middleweight boxing champ Jake LaMotta was bio'ed by Martin Scorsese inRAGING BULL(1980).

For those of you who loathed the packaging of Season 1, prepare to buy more DVD slipcases, because these are packaged the same way...but that is the only flaw on the previous Season carried over.While I haven't yet done an episode by episode check, this season seems to be fixed up in the chronological air date order that Season 1 didn't follow. However, the menus on the individual discs are numbered 1 through 8, etc instead of carrying the episode numbers (which isn't a big deal).This season has featured the commercial bumps on the three episodes we checked out today and they have included Camay, Prell, Tide, and a foam hair dye (Lilt I think).We watched Toody Undercover (featuring Bruce Gordon - Frank Nitty on The Untouchables and Ralph's bully ""Harvey"" from the Classic 39 season of the Honeymooners), The White Elephant (with the Hasty Tasty Luncheonette) and flipped through to the end of ""Hail to the Chief"" to see if Kennedy or Johnson was featured as the President.Kennedy is the president here and is shown in close-ups with Jackie riding in a open automobile through the streets and sitting in it in a crowd...it isn't the far away shot of Johnson waving from a distance that was later played in syndication after Kennedy's assassination would have made this episode feel a bit too uncomfortable.Also, the episodes we watched all had extended scenes or scenes previously cut to make time for additional commercials on TV in later years. We had been watching Car 54 on discs pulled from the TV and, potentially, old VHS tapes, so this was a lot of fun for us. If you had the old VHS tape releases and are merely upgrading format, this may not be a big deal, but it was major for us!Also major is the crisp black and white and superb contrast. If you've been watching these online or on reproductions, then this is going to be a real treat as you can actually read some of the signs in the station such as the ""Rapid Mobilization"" chart.In terms of bonus features, this is much like the previous season in that there is only one - Joe E. Ross doing stand-up (don't worry, this is supposed to be his cleaned up act post show).

ROSS, who played a similar role as kooky SGT. RITZIK on BILKO) and the quieter, more sensible mama's boy FRANCIS MULDOON (FRED GWYNNE, pre-HERMAN MUNSTER). The loud, eclectic cast was rounded out by AL LEWIS (the future GRANDPA MUNSTER) as Officer LEO SCHNAUSER, CHARLOTTE RAE as his wacky wife SYLVIA, and PAUL REED's long suffering CAPTAIN BLOCK, not to mention many familiar BILKO faces in smaller roles; the unorthodox procedures and general chaos that ruled NYPD's 53rd precinct doubtedly served as inspiration for BARNEY MILLER many years later. Filmed on location in the Bronx and armed with fast-paced, preposterous plots, an unforgettable theme song (""There's a holdup in the Bronx, Brooklyn's broken out in fights..."") and a razor sharp cast, CAR 54 was ""just the ticket"" among early sixties sitcoms.RATING: FOUR BADGES",4,OOH!

1520029,AVT7DW1N4GHFP,B006UI5ARY,L'escribe,"[39, 41]",".......you can't beat this great show. Car 54 Where Are You just HAS to be one of the best written, acted and produced comedies in sitcom history. It is terrific television, screamingly funny, and the episodes in Season Two are the carry-over from Season One. Nat Hiken was a comedic genius.Bad news is: the packaging STILL stinks. As I received and unwrapped mine today, Disc One was loose, and the cheap cardboard packaging is not worthy of this great show. HOWEVER, Shanachie FINALLY got it right as each disc in this set contains the correct episodic order of the shows. HOORAY!!(See my other review for Season One,as I had to literally print out the order that one of the reviewers here was kind enough to list, and I have it attached to the Season One package).Most of the reviews have covered the shows, so I won't go into detail, but, this season has lots of guest stars, i.e., Shari Lewis (remember Lamb Chop?) Sugar Ray Robinson and even Mitch Miller!!  Plus, F-Troop's loveable Corporal Agarn, Larry Storch, is great as Charlie the Drunk, and Molly Picon, a marvelous actress who guested in an episode in Season One, is back as Mrs. Bronson.  ""Hail to the Chief"", the first episode, is terrific in that, those of us who remember the Kennedy Presidency get a treat to see JFK and Jackie at the end. However, the shot was taken before he became President, just after he won the Democratic nomination and they were given a ticker-tape parade in downtown Manhattan. (Jackie was pregnant with JFK Jr. here) Terrific nostalgia, nonetheless.I still crack up just looking at Toody's (Joe E. Ross) face. Also included in the Season Two set is a Bonus of Joe E. Ross and his stand-up comedy come back audition film. Supposedly, Car 54 retired to the police garage after just two seasons due to Ross' ego (he reportedly got so big-headed nobody wanted to work with him) and also his wanting to go back to stand up.

1520030,A1GYTNOWU086UP,B006UI5ARY,"Louis A. Roi ""cult geek""","[5, 5]","This review will be for the whole series which encapsulates both box sets, Season's One and Two.Car 54 was a little before my time; I didn't get to see it until the late '80s on Nick-at-Nite.Personally, I was blown away that both Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis were on a program that pre-dated the Munsters.And, just like with the Munsters, both actors shine through as comic geniuses, along with Joe E. Ross.In fact, Al and Fred are very natural in their own skin - they really didn't change their characters once theyput on make-up for their roles in the Munsters.  The two shows blend together.For you Munsters fans, don't forget, Grandpa said that Car 54 was his favorite show.  He said, ""that Al Lewisreally cracks me up""I like the idea that the box sets show, ""brought to you by ..."", clips of classic products of the era.  There aren't alot of special features but I actually like it that way as I think the ""Special Features"" on DVD sets have gotten a littleout of hand; sometimes, the special features are longer in duration than the main material.The packaging could be a little more conducive towards preserving the condition of the discs but this is the growing trendin packaging these days for box sets.Car 54 takes place in the early '60s, in the Bronx.  There are a lot of references to President Kennedy and alot of references to the Jewish population in the Bronx at that time, although other ethnic populations were alsohighlighted in various episodes.The show featured other typical actors/celebrities of the time, including, Nipsey Russell, Larry Storch andRocky Graziano.This is a show that is simply innocent humour based on the classic formula of a small communication gone misinterpretedthat escalates in to complete mayhem and absolute confusion.  This is most obvious in my favorite episode from the SecondSeason - The Biggest Day of the Year.It stands out as one of the most funny shows in early TV history that can be appreciated by all ages and the entire family.I highly recommend checking it out.

Officers Toody and Muldoon are back, this time in proper order for their final season. This was a fun show. The humor was usually gentle, friendly, family-friendly for that matter and so made for a pleasant half-hour of family time.What I missed those many years ago were the occasional forays into politics. This was most noticeable in the episode guest starring Molly Picon. Her role centered around a soon to be tenant of New York public's housing, then just under construction. Of the several things of historic interest in this broadcast is the fact that public housing is not described as a place of last resort but rather as permanent housing built to replace slums. There are several ironies in that last statement. If you look closely you'll see a young Ozzie Davis as a serving member of the 51st precinct. He may not have a lot of lines but he was never required to do any eye rolling black-face shuffling. Take that Lieut. Uhura.If you only know Fred Gwynne as the makeup covered Fred Munster you may not fully appreciate his rubber faced comedic skills. In Car 54 he plays the straight man to the lead comedian Joey E. Ross, Officer Gunther Toody. Gunther is a goodhearted fall guy and the source of most of the laughs Al Lewis known to a later generation as the uncle in the Munsters is here - performing basically the same character - as Officer Leo Schnauzer.

Another one was ""Hail to the Chief,"" where Toody and Muldoon  were first selected to be the President's chauffeurs then passed over as their personal quirks were exposed. I purchased the First Season because I remembered watching the show as a child, but then I discovered that my brother loves Car 54 and would watch it every day if given the chance, so getting the Second Season was a must. Now the packaging of the discs is still not to my liking so I have moved the discs to two double-disc cases with hubs and it works out much better.",5,This completes my Car 54 collection,1335657600,"04 29, 2012",2012,811,"['Car', '54', 'Second', 'Season', 'remaining', '30', 'episodes', 'series', 'am', 'amazed', 'how', 'inventive', 'scripts', 'were', 'exploring', 'little', 'details', 'went', 'police', 'precinct', 'given', 'day', 'how', 'Officer', 'Schnauzer', 'joined', '53rd', 'Mounted', 'Patrol', 'one', 'was', 'Hail', 'Chief', 'where', 'Toody', 'Muldoon', 'were', 'first', 'selected', 'be', 'President', 'chauffeurs', 'then', 'passed', 'personal', 'quirks', 'were', 'exposed', 'purchased', 'First', 'Season', 'remembered', 'watching', 'show', 'child', 'then', 'discovered', 'brother', 'Car', '54', 'would', 'watch', 'day', 'given', 'chance', 'getting', 'Second', 'Season', 'was', 'must', 'Now', 'packaging', 'discs', 'still', 'not', 'liking', 'so', 'have', 'moved', 'discs', 'two', 'double-disc', 'cases', 'hubs', 'out', 'much', 'better']",Car 54 Where Are You?: Season 2
