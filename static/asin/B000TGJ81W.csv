Corpier,"[6, 7]",What we have here Kiddies is the story of a backwoods family feud over a car that has been going on since the 1940s and now two family members are in love but they can't be together because of the feud and just when you think that we have the story of Romeo and Juliet some of the brothers on the girl's side are responsible for the death of the boy sister and they also roughed him up and he naturally calls the famous vengeance Demon.despite the fact that he is warned by the ghost of Lance Henrickson against it.This was another good sequel once again taking place in the same area that the first film took place despite the fact that it was more than likely filmed in Romania.I liked most of the characters. despite the feeling of taking place in the 1940s then I remembered that this is in the back woods areas and some of them are like that. Those of you that have been to Arkansas you know what I mean...OK Arkansas isn't that bad but you get the picture.Back to the point.

What I like about the movie is that although the blood feud between the Hatfields and the McCoys has been raging for decades, it's about to come to a grisly end. When Jodie Hatfield falls in love with Ricky McCoy, her two brothers' brutal attempt to break their engagement leads to the accidental death of Ricky's kid sister instead. Ignoring the ghostly warnings of Ed Harley himself, Ricky calls upon Pumpkinhead the legendary demon of vengeance to avenge his kin by wiping out the Hatfields for good. As the carnage commences and Pumpkinhead slaughters any and all who get in its way, one thing remains certain: if a Hatfield is ever to marry a McCoy, it will be over their dead bodies.

1089512,A20L3YKLJA2G95,B000TGJ81W,Jay,"[0, 1]","Pumpkinhead is back for the forth time, straight to dvd and better then ever (except for his first appearance). After pretty weak reviews for Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes this installment has seemed to add a little hope that they can still pump out something decent in the series. It appears the producers decided to keep the revenge slayings to a maximum to keep viewers from falling asleep half way through. This one was bloody for sure, hence the title Blood Feud.The story starts with the well known intense feud between the Hatfields and McCoys. Jodie Hatfield and Ricky McCoy are the only two between the families that have put rivalries behind due to their love for each other. With no end in sight they decide leave town so they can enjoy their relationship without the constant family feuding (not the game show type). So late one night after the Hatfields crashed a McCoy wedding Jodie sneaks away with Ricky while his sister Sara keeps a look out. Despite their efforts they are found in the woods by Jodie's brothers and Sara winds up being killed. Ricky being enraged consults the witch and summons Pumpkinhead who wastes no time ripping people apart. The fury is unleashed on the Hatfields in one non stop bloody mess.As we've seen our fourth appearance of Pumpkinhead it is now evident we will see much more CGI and much less of the true creature himself. Hey things change overtime so you just roll with it. None the less the film is really fun and entertaining. It's by far the best sci-fi channel original they've put out yet to date. Like in other reviews I've done for the series I can only recommend this to the Pumpkinhead fans. I'd think most people who like horror will get a kick out of Blood Feud, but if you're not into the Pumpkinhead idea you probably won't enjoy this one.",4,"The Hatfields and the McCoys meet their true rival, Pumpkinhead",1246752000,"07 5, 2009",2009,1801,"['Pumpkinhead', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'straight', 'dvd', 'better', 'then', 'ever', 'first', 'appearance', 'pretty', 'weak', 'reviews', 'Pumpkinhead', 'Ashes', 'Ashes', 'installment', 'seemed', 'add', 'little', 'hope', 'can', 'still', 'pump', 'out', 'something', 'decent', 'series', 'producers', 'decided', 'keep', 'revenge', 'slayings', 'maximum', 'keep', 'viewers', 'falling', 'asleep', 'half', 'way', 'one', 'was', 'bloody', 'sure', 'hence', 'title', 'Blood', 'Feud.The', 'story', 'well', 'known', 'intense', 'feud', 'Hatfields', 'McCoys', 'Jodie', 'Hatfield', 'Ricky', 'McCoy', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'families', 'have', 'put', 'rivalries', 'due', 'love', 'other', 'end', 'sight', 'decide', 'leave', 'town', 'can', 'enjoy', 'relationship', 'constant', 'family', 'feuding', 'not', 'game', 'show', 'type', 'So', 'late', 'one', 'night', 'Hatfields', 'crashed', 'McCoy', 'wedding', 'Jodie', 'away', 'Ricky', 'sister', 'Sara', 'look', 'out', 'efforts', 'are', 'found', 'woods', 'Jodie', 'brothers', 'Sara', 'up', 'being', 'killed', 'Ricky', 'being', 'enraged', 'consults', 'witch', 'summons', 'Pumpkinhead', 'who', 'time', 'ripping', 'people', 'apart', 'fury', 'unleashed', 'Hatfields', 'one', 'non', 'stop', 'bloody', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'fourth', 'appearance', 'Pumpkinhead', 'now', 'evident', 'will', 'see', 'much', 'more', 'CGI', 'much', 'less', 'true', 'creature', 'Hey', 'things', 'change', 'overtime', 'so', 'just', 'roll', 'less', 'film', 'really', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'far', 'best', 'sci-fi', 'channel', ""'ve"", 'put', 'out', 'yet', 'date', 'other', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'done', 'series', 'can', 'only', 'recommend', 'Pumpkinhead', 'fans', ""'d"", 'think', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'horror', 'will', 'get', 'kick', 'Blood', 'Feud', ""'re"", 'not', 'Pumpkinhead', 'idea', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'one']",Pumpkinhead 4: Blood Feud

It was a spooky ghost story with plenty of atmosphere. The opening scene is still creepily effective.This, is not that. ""Blood Feud"" has terrible editing, sound editing, effects...I could go on and on. It's just cringe-worthy to hear all those Romanians try to produce credible southern accents. More often than not, they sound like bad ""Forrest Gump"" impersonators.Lance Henriksen returns (did he not see the script? Was the entire budget spent on his role?), as Ed Harley. I thought his character was sent to Hell, but I guess that doesn't matter when you need a familiar face for the 3rd sequel. The character of the witch is back as well, though in less-effective makeup and presence.Having said all that, I didn't hate it. There are moments that remind me of the original. Obviously, the director did what he could with a limited  budget.

As soon as I heard about it, I put it on my must have list, and basically bought it because of Lance Henrikson's name.The sub-title, Blood Feud, out me in mind of the Sequel, which is a bit of a dog to watch, but still has some good creature FX. And the FX in this seem to be mostly practical, however so much CGI is seamless, there could be lots, but on what I suspect the budget is, I doubt. Whatever the budget is or was, it was not spent on ADR. Some scenes have been re-dubbed in the worst manner. This having been said, the elements of the occult, the full on appearance of the Demon, and some fleshing out of the Mythos provide some great material. Like the First film, its Lance who has the core of this film, even if he does only appear in a few scenes.The Attacks and the makeup work is first rate.Whomever they used for that did a great job.THE DVD: The audio is fairly good. On a 5.1 sound systtem its excellent. However, the film is all you get. With one of Horrors iconic actors in an iconic role, you would think that some thought for extras might have been at  the very  least looked into. But, I had a blast watching the film. For me, Lance made this film, but hell, I'm a Lance Henrikson fan. I just wish that the producers of some films will stop short changing fans, and if they produce B class films, at least provide a ton of extras to make up the difference.I also wish that the ratings ""bored"" would stop with the idiocy; I see more violence on a news cast, and thats saying something, given that this film is fairly full on.",4,Pumpkin Soup,1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,1592,"['failings', 'enjoyed', 'disc', 'As', 'soon', 'heard', 'put', 'must', 'have', 'list', 'basically', 'bought', 'Lance', 'Henrikson', 'name.The', 'sub-title', 'Blood', 'Feud', 'mind', 'Sequel', 'bit', 'dog', 'watch', 'still', 'good', 'creature', 'FX', 'FX', 'seem', 'be', 'mostly', 'practical', 'however', 'so', 'much', 'CGI', 'seamless', 'could', 'be', 'lots', 'what', 'suspect', 'budget', 'doubt', 'Whatever', 'budget', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'spent', 'ADR', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 're-dubbed', 'worst', 'manner', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'elements', 'occult', 'full', 'appearance', 'Demon', 'fleshing', 'Mythos', 'provide', 'great', 'material', 'First', 'film', 'Lance', 'who', 'core', 'film', 'even', 'only', 'appear', 'few', 'scenes.The', 'Attacks', 'makeup', 'work', 'first', 'rate.Whomever', 'used', 'did', 'great', 'job.THE', 'DVD', 'audio', 'fairly', 'good', '5.1', 'sound', 'systtem', 'excellent', 'However', 'film', 'get', 'one', 'Horrors', 'iconic', 'actors', 'iconic', 'role', 'would', 'think', 'thought', 'extras', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'least', 'looked', 'had', 'blast', 'watching', 'film', 'Lance', 'made', 'film', 'hell', ""'m"", 'Lance', 'Henrikson', 'fan', 'just', 'wish', 'producers', 'films', 'will', 'stop', 'short', 'changing', 'fans', 'produce', 'B', 'class', 'films', 'least', 'provide', 'ton', 'extras', 'make', 'up', 'difference.I', 'also', 'ratings', 'bored', 'would', 'stop', 'idiocy', 'see', 'more', 'violence', 'news', 'cast', 'thats', 'saying', 'something', 'given', 'film', 'fairly', 'full']",Pumpkinhead 4: Blood Feud

The first film was original and the effects were done before CGI became commonplace at even low-budget levels, so the monster was genuinely firghtening and oter-worldly.  It was a smart film for the genre, and the acting was better than average.The sequels have been abysmal, but this one is probably the best of the lot.  It has an interesting premise, marrying the genuine American folklore of the Hatfields and McCoys with the engaging original beast.  The story is a little overwrought, the CGI - when used - is laughable, and when CGI isn't used there's too much of the monster revealed so you see it for the rubber suit it is.  It's enough to make you wonder why they didn't just use the far better lighting/marionnette techniques of the original - it certainly had to be cheaper, if more work.  In the original, PH was impossibly designed.  Using a guy in a suit - even on sicks - just looks like a guy in a suit.

1089522,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000TGJ81W,Wuchak,"[0, 2]","The appeal of the original ""Pumpkinhead"" (1988) was its creepy atmosphere, serious vibe, malevolent monster and the always reliable Lance Henriksen, but other than these factors it wasn't anything noteworthy. As far as overall entertainment goes, practically every Friday the 13th sequel was/is superior.""Pumpkinhead 4: Blood Feud"" (2007) is the third sequel and -- although it was shot in Romania rather than California -- it stays true to the original concept by having a similar revenge plot and features the three main characters of the original: Ed Harley (Henriksen), albeit now a ghost; the ugly, old witch; and, of course, Pumpkinhead itself. Although Henriksen is 18 years older he's just fine; the witch looks almost exactly the same; as does Pumpkinhead. Speaking of which, some complain about the appearance of pumpkinhead, but he (it) looks great to me; I know it's probably done via CGI, unlike the original, but it works and I couldn't discern any strings, so to speak.The unique thing here is that the story involves a modern-day take on the Hatfield/McCoy feud crossed with Romeo & Juliet, which I found interesting.The creature is featured prominently throughout, as are Henriksen and the witch, and there's loads of gore, but I didn't find the story or the characters all that compelling. It's not bad, but it's not good either; it's somewhere in between. The story needed more drawing power. Still, it's a decent sequel.GRADE: C",3,Meh,1342137600,"07 13, 2012",2012,1448,"['appeal', 'original', 'Pumpkinhead', '1988', 'was', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'serious', 'vibe', 'malevolent', 'monster', 'always', 'reliable', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'other', 'factors', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'noteworthy', 'As', 'far', 'overall', 'entertainment', 'practically', 'Friday', '13th', 'sequel', 'was/is', 'superior', 'Pumpkinhead', '4', 'Blood', 'Feud', '2007', 'third', 'sequel', 'was', 'shot', 'Romania', 'rather', 'California', 'true', 'original', 'concept', 'having', 'similar', 'revenge', 'plot', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'original', 'Ed', 'Harley', 'Henriksen', 'albeit', 'now', 'ghost', 'ugly', 'old', 'witch', 'course', 'Pumpkinhead', 'Henriksen', '18', 'years', 'just', 'fine', 'witch', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'Pumpkinhead', 'Speaking', 'complain', 'appearance', 'pumpkinhead', 'great', 'know', 'probably', 'done', 'CGI', 'original', 'could', ""n't"", 'discern', 'strings', 'so', 'speak.The', 'unique', 'thing', 'here', 'story', 'modern-day', 'take', 'Hatfield/McCoy', 'feud', 'crossed', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'found', 'interesting.The', 'creature', 'featured', 'prominently', 'are', 'Henriksen', 'witch', 'loads', 'gore', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'story', 'characters', 'compelling', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'good', 'either', 'somewhere', 'story', 'needed', 'more', 'drawing', 'power', 'Still', 'decent', 'sequel.GRADE', 'C']",Pumpkinhead 4: Blood Feud
