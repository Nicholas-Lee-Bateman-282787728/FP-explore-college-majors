Keeping close to scripture in key portions of Mary's and Jesus' lives, the film, nevertheless, may bring controversy with some of the fill-in interpretational moments.  With good performances all around, especially Pernilla August in the title role and Christian Bale as the grown Jesus, the movie, however, presents a Mary that's a little more outspoken and fiesty than we're accustomed to.  (Sometimes I had to wince when Mary teaches Jesus the ""Good Samaritan"" story and her protest against a stoning of an adulterer before Jesus is born.  Yet, the Bible does state that Jesus ""increased in wisdom and in stature...""  He did learn things.)  Also, John the Baptist seems fiery and folksy enough to bring a genuine translation (one of the best performances in memory of him), and Judy Cornwell as the Innkeeper's wife (Judy Cornwell) provides some comic relief with her robust performance.  The details are also worthy.  The scenery provides a simple beauty that never brings a stage presence to the film.Just as 'The Robe' surmises the Jesus story from the point-of-view of a convert after the repurcussions of Jesus's ordeal, 'Mary,...' provides another portrait of the gospel as witnessed by a key participant in Jesus's life.",3,The Gospel According to Mary,1173225600,"03 7, 2007",2007,1367,"['Implementing', 'admirably', 'brisk', 'pace', 'sporting', 'exciting', 'crowd', 'chase', 'scenes', ""'Mary"", 'Mother', 'Jesus', 'instant', 'appeal', 'Keeping', 'close', 'scripture', 'key', 'portions', 'Mary', 'Jesus', 'lives', 'film', 'nevertheless', 'may', 'bring', 'controversy', 'fill-in', 'interpretational', 'moments', 'good', 'performances', 'around', 'especially', 'Pernilla', 'August', 'title', 'role', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'grown', 'Jesus', 'movie', 'however', 'Mary', 'little', 'more', 'outspoken', 'fiesty', ""'re"", 'accustomed', 'Sometimes', 'had', 'wince', 'when', 'Mary', 'Jesus', 'Good', 'Samaritan', 'story', 'protest', 'stoning', 'adulterer', 'Jesus', 'born', 'Bible', 'state', 'Jesus', 'increased', 'wisdom', 'stature', 'did', 'learn', 'things', 'Also', 'John', 'Baptist', 'fiery', 'folksy', 'enough', 'bring', 'genuine', 'translation', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'memory', 'Judy', 'Cornwell', 'Innkeeper', 'wife', 'Judy', 'Cornwell', 'comic', 'relief', 'robust', 'performance', 'details', 'are', 'also', 'worthy', 'scenery', 'simple', 'beauty', 'never', 'stage', 'presence', 'film.Just', ""'The"", 'Robe', 'Jesus', 'story', 'point-of-view', 'convert', 'repurcussions', 'Jesus', 'ordeal', ""'Mary"", 'portrait', 'gospel', 'witnessed', 'key', 'participant', 'Jesus', 'life']",N/A

Baker,"[4, 7]","When I saw the Kennedy family was involved in the production of this insulting-to-God, junk theology, I expected a shallow interpretation of the life of Mary and wasn't really shocked to view the product. I was offended nonetheless. Can you imagine a Kennedy offering the slightest resistance to any form of trendy pseudo-intellectual elitism?Elitists cannot tolerate the idea that the great unwashed can have religious understandings that do not presuppose the superiority of elitists, so if sophisticated people find it hard to accept miracles, then the possibilities for miracles must be denied, and those who believe in such possibilities need to be instructed and corrected.If elitists have a hard time believing in God, well then, a story about the Holy Family can't even be depicted as having too much to do with God, no real divine intervention or unique moments of grace. What is grace anyhow? Did they teach that at Harvard?Elitists cannot conceive of anyone better than themselves, so the humanity of the Holy Family has to prove they have no singular unique divine endowments but are in fact as shallow as everyone, except of course, elitists, who are never shallow and whose job it is to explain life to everyone else. Ever wonder how we got a president who knows absolutely nothing about economics, history, or science perpetually lecturing us on economics, history, and science?If elitists can't conceive of a man, fortified with divine grace, living with humility, unlike an elitist, standing by his betrothed without becoming enraged by her pregnancy to the brink of beating her up, such as the Joseph presented in this story, well, it just ain't gonna happen.Speaking of not happening, unless you're as dimwitted as a contemporary intellectual elitist, you have to be able to predict the Baptism of Christ is not going to include a voice from on high announcing Jesus as His Son, and it certainly didn't occur in this travesty.The Annunciation was presented as Mary confused and skeptical and not the least bit filled with grace. Years later we see Mary with her obligatory feminist consciousness asserting itself. There really was no angel you see, the Annunciation encounter with what she first thought was an angel was only Mary being true to her inner feminist voice. The only thing that didn't surprise me with this trash film is having Mary consider getting an abortion, but I'm sure the writers thought about it. Consistent with contemporary revisionism, the crucifixion is presented not as Christ absorbing the sins of man, but a great big misunderstanding. Life is so full of accidents. After all, God, if God exists, is not doing as good a job as an elitist would be able to do in the same position as God. How can we expect to be accountable for such a thing as sin if God Himself is not all that competent.Save your money, muster up some honorable respect for Christianity, even if you're an atheist, and boycott this garbage.",1,Grand Opera of Elitist Fantasy,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",2013,2956,"['When', 'saw', 'Kennedy', 'family', 'was', 'involved', 'production', 'insulting-to-God', 'junk', 'theology', 'expected', 'shallow', 'interpretation', 'life', 'Mary', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'shocked', 'view', 'product', 'was', 'offended', 'nonetheless', 'Can', 'imagine', 'Kennedy', 'offering', 'slightest', 'resistance', 'form', 'trendy', 'pseudo-intellectual', 'elitism', 'Elitists', 'can', 'not', 'tolerate', 'idea', 'great', 'unwashed', 'can', 'have', 'religious', 'understandings', 'do', 'not', 'presuppose', 'superiority', 'elitists', 'so', 'sophisticated', 'people', 'find', 'hard', 'accept', 'miracles', 'then', 'possibilities', 'miracles', 'must', 'be', 'denied', 'who', 'believe', 'such', 'possibilities', 'need', 'be', 'instructed', 'corrected.If', 'elitists', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'God', 'well', 'then', 'story', 'Holy', 'Family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'depicted', 'having', 'too', 'much', 'do', 'God', 'real', 'divine', 'intervention', 'unique', 'moments', 'grace', 'What', 'grace', 'anyhow', 'Did', 'teach', 'Harvard', 'Elitists', 'can', 'not', 'conceive', 'anyone', 'better', 'humanity', 'Holy', 'Family', 'prove', 'have', 'singular', 'unique', 'divine', 'endowments', 'are', 'fact', 'as', 'shallow', 'everyone', 'course', 'elitists', 'who', 'are', 'never', 'shallow', 'job', 'explain', 'life', 'everyone', 'else', 'Ever', 'wonder', 'how', 'got', 'president', 'who', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'economics', 'history', 'science', 'perpetually', 'lecturing', 'economics', 'history', 'science', 'elitists', 'ca', ""n't"", 'conceive', 'man', 'fortified', 'divine', 'grace', 'living', 'humility', 'elitist', 'standing', 'betrothed', 'becoming', 'enraged', 'pregnancy', 'brink', 'beating', 'up', 'such', 'Joseph', 'presented', 'story', 'well', 'just', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'happen.Speaking', 'not', 'happening', ""'re"", 'as', 'dimwitted', 'contemporary', 'intellectual', 'elitist', 'have', 'be', 'able', 'predict', 'Baptism', 'Christ', 'not', 'going', 'include', 'voice', 'high', 'announcing', 'Jesus', 'Son', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'occur', 'travesty.The', 'Annunciation', 'was', 'presented', 'Mary', 'confused', 'skeptical', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'filled', 'grace', 'Years', 'later', 'see', 'Mary', 'obligatory', 'feminist', 'consciousness', 'asserting', 'really', 'was', 'angel', 'see', 'Annunciation', 'encounter', 'what', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'angel', 'was', 'only', 'Mary', 'being', 'true', 'inner', 'feminist', 'voice', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'trash', 'film', 'having', 'Mary', 'consider', 'getting', 'abortion', ""'m"", 'sure', 'writers', 'thought', 'Consistent', 'contemporary', 'revisionism', 'crucifixion', 'presented', 'not', 'Christ', 'absorbing', 'sins', 'man', 'great', 'big', 'misunderstanding', 'Life', 'so', 'full', 'accidents', 'God', 'God', 'not', 'doing', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'elitist', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'same', 'position', 'God', 'How', 'can', 'expect', 'be', 'accountable', 'such', 'thing', 'sin', 'God', 'Himself', 'not', 'competent.Save', 'money', 'muster', 'up', 'honorable', 'respect', 'Christianity', 'even', ""'re"", 'atheist', 'boycott', 'garbage']",N/A

545070,A140XH16IKR4B0,B00003IPFL,Jean E. Pouliot,"[10, 19]","In 1999, it just so happened that two of the major networks aired versions of the Jesus story the same month. ""Jesus,"" which I review elsewhere, was one; the other was ""Mary, Mother of Jesus."" Of the two, ""Jesus"" emerged as original and likeable, with MMOJ coming in a distant second.MMOJ, bankrolled by the very Catholic Shriver Foundation, seeks to highlight the special relationship between Mary and Jesus. Yet it is a queer composite of a movie. On one hand, it seeks to humanize Mary. She is shown as a headstrong (though virtuous) teenage girl who stands up to the Romans and her hotheaded male townsmen. Uncharacteristically for the time period, she runs around without male escort or head covering. She asks no permission of her betrothed, Joseph, to travel to the Judaean hill country to visit her cousin Elizabeth. She is vocal about denouncing fellow male Jews who stone a woman to death for adultery.On the other hand, the film could easily function as a brief for the defense of the idea of Mary as Co-Redemptrix. This Marian title is being pushed by conservative Catholics (including the late Pope John Paul II) and asks us to accept the idea that Mary was so intimately and necessarily associated with salvation wrought by Christ, a claim rejected by nearly all but the most conservative of Roman Catholics. To this end, we are shown Mary as the source of Jesus's parables; she tells the Good Samaritan as a bedtime story. When Christ is suffering on the cross and about to give in to despair, she bolsters his spirit--by reciting the Lord's Prayer--and helps him to endure until the end. She is graced with a non-biblical post-Resurrection appearance. She single-handedly rallies the downhearted disciples to continue her Son's mission.The movie is problematic on many fronts. First, it is too short to accommodate the subject matter -- and commercial breaks. Criminals are no sooner crucified than their corpses are hauled down from their crosses. And there is the problem of the aging of Mary. Teenage Mary is played adequately (if uni-dimensionally) by Melinda Kinnaman. When we next see Mary a scant 12 years later, Kinnamon has been replaced by Pernilla August, whose easily looks thirty years than the acrtress she replaced. Though she is an actress of far greater range and subtlety, reserving Pernilla for the end of the film, hen Jesus as a grown man, would have flowed better. Architecturally, the film's depiction of Jerusalem, with odd pointed towers, is completely wrong. And other period films have done a far better job of accurately depicting Roman battle gear.Theologically, Mary is given a role and influence that the gospels reserve for Jesus alone. Mary and Jesus decide together when it is time to start his mission. They are baptized together by John the Baptist, and Mary accompanies Jesus on much of his mission, rather than occasionally as indicated by Scripture. While this may enthrall the co-redemptrix supporters, it may baffle or even anger others. The movie's message too is devoid of theological import. Mary urges us to love as Jesus loved, something that could be said about any good person. His role as redeeming Son of God is muted, not unexpected in a mass marketed TV movie.As a Sunday school teacher, the movie has limited utility, though there it has a few nice features. The annunciation scene, with its shimmering, mirage-like angelic messenger, is visually other-worldly and plausible. Elizabeth seems appropriately too old to be pregnant. And Joseph, played wonderfully by David Threlfall, is plausible as the older spouse of a younger woman. The human love story of Mary and Joseph is beautiful to watch. The real star of the film is the relationship between Jesus and his mother. Christian Bale (in a predecessor to his marvelous role in this year's ""Batman Begins"") plays Jesus as second fiddle to his mother. Though a scene in which he gives a sculpted toy pony to a retarded girl is touching.""Mary, Mother of Jesus"" often strays far from the gospels, but does so with a good heart. Catch the movie as a meditation on the relationship between Mary and Jesus, but supplement it with ""Jesus"" for a better drama and ""Jesus of Nazareth"" for scriptural accuracy.",3,Fervent yet flawed study of a human-divine relationship,1126051200,"09 7, 2005",2005,4221,"['1999', 'just', 'so', 'happened', 'two', 'major', 'networks', 'aired', 'versions', 'Jesus', 'story', 'same', 'month', 'Jesus', 'review', 'elsewhere', 'was', 'one', 'other', 'was', 'Mary', 'Mother', 'Jesus', 'two', 'Jesus', 'emerged', 'original', 'likeable', 'MMOJ', 'coming', 'distant', 'second.MMOJ', 'bankrolled', 'very', 'Catholic', 'Shriver', 'Foundation', 'highlight', 'special', 'relationship', 'Mary', 'Jesus', 'queer', 'composite', 'movie', 'one', 'hand', 'humanize', 'Mary', 'shown', 'headstrong', 'virtuous', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'up', 'Romans', 'hotheaded', 'male', 'townsmen', 'Uncharacteristically', 'time', 'period', 'male', 'escort', 'head', 'covering', 'permission', 'betrothed', 'Joseph', 'travel', 'Judaean', 'hill', 'country', 'visit', 'cousin', 'Elizabeth', 'vocal', 'denouncing', 'fellow', 'male', 'Jews', 'who', 'stone', 'woman', 'death', 'other', 'hand', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'function', 'brief', 'defense', 'idea', 'Mary', 'Co-Redemptrix', 'Marian', 'title', 'being', 'pushed', 'conservative', 'Catholics', 'including', 'late', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'accept', 'idea', 'Mary', 'was', 'so', 'intimately', 'necessarily', 'associated', 'salvation', 'wrought', 'Christ', 'claim', 'rejected', 'nearly', 'most', 'conservative', 'Roman', 'Catholics', 'end', 'are', 'shown', 'Mary', 'source', 'Jesus', 'parables', 'Good', 'Samaritan', 'bedtime', 'story', 'When', 'Christ', 'suffering', 'cross', 'give', 'despair', 'spirit', 'reciting', 'Lord', 'Prayer', 'endure', 'end', 'graced', 'non-biblical', 'post-Resurrection', 'appearance', 'single-handedly', 'downhearted', 'disciples', 'continue', 'Son', 'mission.The', 'movie', 'problematic', 'many', 'fronts', 'First', 'too', 'short', 'accommodate', 'subject', 'matter', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'Criminals', 'are', 'sooner', 'crucified', 'corpses', 'are', 'hauled', 'down', 'crosses', 'problem', 'aging', 'Mary', 'Teenage', 'Mary', 'played', 'adequately', 'uni-dimensionally', 'Melinda', 'Kinnaman', 'When', 'next', 'see', 'Mary', 'scant', '12', 'years', 'later', 'Kinnamon', 'been', 'replaced', 'Pernilla', 'August', 'easily', 'thirty', 'years', 'acrtress', 'replaced', 'actress', 'far', 'greater', 'range', 'subtlety', 'reserving', 'Pernilla', 'end', 'film', 'hen', 'Jesus', 'grown', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'flowed', 'better', 'Architecturally', 'film', 'depiction', 'Jerusalem', 'odd', 'pointed', 'towers', 'completely', 'wrong', 'other', 'period', 'films', 'have', 'done', 'far', 'better', 'job', 'accurately', 'depicting', 'Roman', 'battle', 'gear.Theologically', 'Mary', 'given', 'role', 'influence', 'gospels', 'reserve', 'Jesus', 'alone', 'Mary', 'Jesus', 'decide', 'together', 'when', 'time', 'start', 'mission', 'are', 'baptized', 'together', 'John', 'Baptist', 'Mary', 'accompanies', 'Jesus', 'much', 'mission', 'rather', 'occasionally', 'indicated', 'Scripture', 'may', 'enthrall', 'co-redemptrix', 'supporters', 'may', 'baffle', 'even', 'anger', 'others', 'movie', 'message', 'too', 'devoid', 'theological', 'import', 'Mary', 'love', 'Jesus', 'loved', 'something', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'good', 'person', 'role', 'redeeming', 'Son', 'God', 'muted', 'not', 'unexpected', 'mass', 'marketed', 'TV', 'movie.As', 'Sunday', 'school', 'teacher', 'movie', 'limited', 'utility', 'few', 'nice', 'features', 'annunciation', 'scene', 'shimmering', 'mirage-like', 'angelic', 'messenger', 'visually', 'other-worldly', 'plausible', 'Elizabeth', 'appropriately', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'pregnant', 'Joseph', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'David', 'Threlfall', 'plausible', 'older', 'spouse', 'younger', 'woman', 'human', 'love', 'story', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'relationship', 'Jesus', 'mother', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'predecessor', 'marvelous', 'role', 'year', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Jesus', 'second', 'fiddle', 'mother', 'scene', 'sculpted', 'toy', 'pony', 'retarded', 'girl', 'touching', 'Mary', 'Mother', 'Jesus', 'often', 'far', 'gospels', 'so', 'good', 'heart', 'Catch', 'movie', 'meditation', 'relationship', 'Mary', 'Jesus', 'supplement', 'Jesus', 'better', 'drama', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', 'scriptural', 'accuracy']",N/A

I purchased this item because some Catholic reviews stated that it is a beautiful and worthy movie.  As a Catholic, I am truly offended by this depiction of our Blessed Mother Mary and our Lord Jesus.  I realize that trying to cut what should have been a great movie down to 90 minutes possesses problems, but it doesn't require such drastic changes from the scriptures; ie., king Herod's slaughter of the innocents being from 2 years to 6 months of age, Jesus giving the description of the holy eucharist (communion) as his body and blood from John chapter 6 immediately after he reads from the book of Isaiah in the synagogue, and numerous other total inconsistencies with scripture and the teachings of the holy catholic Church.  It should also be noted that the Executive Producer of this project was Eunice Kennedy Shriver--a prominent member of the Kennedy clan who accomplished many wonderful and worthy projects before her death; however, if she allowed such a poor movie to be produced concerning our Blessed Mother it could only be because of callous disregard for Christians of all stripes, or because she actually thought this was a good movie, or because she didn't actually review the movie and simply had her name attached without actually being involved.

With only a few minor mentions in scripture, Mary has remained a stoic symbol of the greatest of maternal love.  In this reverent and sincere version produced by Eunice Shriver and her son Bobby, MARY's story is filled in plausibly and benefits from a marvelous performance from Pernilla August as the adult Mary.  Interesting suppositions include the stories told to a young Jesus that eventually end up being the parables He teaches his followers in his later years.  Christian Bale makes an austere and handsome Christ, but since the story is focusing on Mary, Christ's passion is dealt with almost surreptitiously, serving only as a background to how his Mother must face this devastating loss.

I feel the writers in this movie really tried to be true to the scripture that inspired it, but it can be so easy to stray from the spirit of what needs to be told when trying to flesh out characters, storylines, etc. The salavation story of Jesus and the part Mary played in it is so huge that trying to compress it into the short time required by this movie is almost impossible.

Dack ""adcomm""","[10, 15]","When a major network must start its film with a disclaimer that reads, &quot;While dramatic license has been taken, we believe this film reflects the spirit and historical significance of the biblical story of Mary and Jesus,&quot; it is best to turn the channel immediately. The film begins with Mary fleeing from the Romans as they are attacking her village. As the story unfolds, an angel appears to Mary outside of the city to announce her pregnancy. The Bible says it was inside the city, but NBC must know better. Mary is then threatened with stoning by her fellow villagers, and Joseph comes to her aid, also not found in the gospel passages. After Jesus' birth, Herod tells his soldiers to kill all children six months and younger, another Bible inaccuracy. Further into the film, Jesus' family is returning from Egypt, Roman soldiers ride by, and Jesus remarks that Herod must be dead. Jesus is depicted as a teenager in this scene. So when did Herod die?The next few scenes involve Jesus in the Temple. Mary and Joseph find him, scold the young man, and Jesus remarks that he must be about his Father's business. Biblically, that's an accurate portrayal, but the scene just prior to this is not. Jesus is attacked by a local bully, and he refuses to fight. After the confrontation, Jesus asks the question to Mary, &quot;Why do I see these things (not wanting to fight because it solves nothing) but no one else does?&quot; Either Jesus knew who he was or he did not. Throughout the film, this identity crisis is a major theme.An hour into the film, Jesus is finally ready for ministry, or is he? Mary convinces Jesus to go on his ministry and be baptized by John. In the conversations between Jesus and Mary, Jesus uses the term &quot;we&quot; as if Mary is an essential component to his success. Shortly afterwards, Mary and Jesus are seen walking down a dirt road, and Jesus makes the bizarre statement that he had not heard God's voice for eighteen years. The last time Jesus had heard the voice was when he was in the temple at the age of twelve, but the Bible makes it very clear that Jesus walked in favor with God and man (Luke 2:52). Jesus was not abandoned by God nor left alone as the film suggests. NBC adds to the theme of uncertainty by depicting Jesus as being fearful. In a night- time scene, Mary and Jesus are walking near a campfire, and they pause to converse. Jesus, visibly shaking and fearful, repeatedly asks the question, &quot;Is it right? Is it right?&quot; As Mary tries to convince him that the power that Jesus feels inside of himself, post-baptism, is an acceptable thing to have and he should use it as part of his mission (NBC, 1999).

545083,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00003IPFL,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","1999's low-budget ""Mary, Mother of Jesus"" is, to my mind, the most moving film adaption of the Christmas story, particularly the first third of the 90-minute film.The first 30-minutes or so comprise the Christmas story: Mary's encounter with an angel, her miraculous pregnancy, Joseph's initial decision to end their betrothal and changing his mind after a God-given dream, Jesus' birth in a Bethlehem stable, the 3 wise men and their gifts, Herod's murderous decision to kill all infants in the area, Joseph & Mary's escape, etc.Even though this is a low-budget picture, the filmmakers successfully create a powerfully affecting ambiance of reverence and beauty. It's hard to explain, but the film will move you to tears multiple times in the first half hour alone!At the halfway point we meet Jesus at 30-years of age, played by Christian Bale (renown for the modern Batman picture). To be expected, the rest of the movie details Jesus' baptism, anointing, ministry, capture, torture, death and resurrection. Since there are only about 45-minutes to show all this there's not a lot of detail and the film loses the potent appeal of the first half, but it's not bad at all, it's just that the story passes by so briskly, which isn't a negative if you're in the mood for a fast-moving account of the story.Other films may have captured Jesus' ministry, death and resurrection better, like ""The Passion of the Christ (Widescreen Edition)"", but no other film captures the Christmas story as well as ""Mary, Mother of Jesus,"" despite the low-budget. This includes the more recent ""The Nativity Story,"" which has far better production values.This can be attributed to a handful of factors: Good actors in the main roles, e.g. Pernilla August as Mary and David Threlfall as Joseph, both outstanding; a quality score; and convincing sets, costumes & locations. (As far as locations go, IMDb states that the film was shot in Budapest, Hungary, but there are a lot of desert-like locations that clearly indicate that the film was shot somewhere in the general area of Israel and the Middle East).FINAL WORD: ""Mary, the Mother of Jesus"" is worth checking out for its depiction of the Christmas story alone.

I'm just going to review the actual quality of this movie. And that quality is remarkably low.I'm assuming that this is a made-for-tv movie, because it definitely plays like one, there's even occasional blackouts, I'm guessing where there were originally commercial breaks. The main problems with this film, and there are several minor ones we won't concern with, are the production value being incredibly low, the fact that all the actors are white and have ENGLISH accents (they even go so far as to have the owner of the manger where Jesus is born have a COCKNEY accent, as if to show she's of a lower class, but a lower BRITISH class,mind you), and the stilted dialogue accompanied by painful performances.Christian Bale is still surprisingly good, even surrounded by so much mediocrity, but one actor can only pull a film so far, especially when the film is focussed on the life of Mary, and so Jesus doesn't come into the film until about a third of the way through. Bale is really the reason I wanted to see this movie, and it's almost worth seeing just to see Bale's intense devotion to his character amidst such an absurd backdrop. You really have to feel bad for him, but also thankful that he got cast in American Psycho the year after this and shot to stardom instead of languishing in films like this for years to come.Mary, Mother of Jesus is so devastatingly bad that at times it almost seems like a Monty Python parody of a Christian movie. Honestly, if you're moved by a single frame in this film then you are simply predisposed to enjoy it no matter what the quality, because this film is of the lowest caliber.
