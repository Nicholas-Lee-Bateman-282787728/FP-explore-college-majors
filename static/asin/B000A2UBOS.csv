It is supposed to be reality Point Of View (POV) camera work, but in fact moves back and forth quickly between standard melodramatic television camera to what these two characters are seeing and thinking.Mark is the one with a job and an apartment. In theory, he's the normal one. Jeremy is the slacker room mate, no job, loves to create music on his keyboard, and is looking for a big break in the music industry. Normal seems to flow back and forth between the two of them. Sometimes Mark does some kind of incredibly creepy thing, while Jeremy is perfectly average. Most of the time, Jeremy does something stupid, and Mark complains about it.Mark is secretly in love with Sophie (Olivia Colman - was spectacular in the BBC spoof of the British Olympics preparation television show Twenty Twelve). He does super creepy things to her. For some reason she is attracted to him. Jeremy is in love with the recently divorced neighbor woman. And he does equally creepy things, and she is occasionally attracted to him.Peep Show is not the dirty movie American idea, but a peep or look into the lives of these two guys. This is mostly PG-13 television, aside from the occasional drug use and strong language. There are a few adult jokes.The show is really funny in a cringing way.

I wouldn't go quite that far myself, but it's in that same dry, painfully realistic style.  Unlike most buddy-comedies, there's no one-dimensional smart guy/dumb guy dichotomy here.  Mark and Jeremy both have their good and bad sides, and it's mostly the latter that we see.  Here as usual, it's the mistakes and insecurities that provide for most of the laughs, and as with most British comedies, they're not offset by any sappy feelgood resolutions.My only criticism of Peep Show is that it's hard to understand how Mark and Jeremy could be friends in the first place.  They're just too different for their relationship to be at all convincing, even if the show tried to establish that part of the story (which it doesn't).

Morgan,"[32, 33]","As an American, I was thrilled to live in Europe last year; however, the Irish, Welsh, Scots and English have a marked difference in their preferred ""sitcoms"" to our own beloved overblown, baudy, curse-filled ones. I like the original Coupling, and indeed the original Office, but when I saw Peep Show for the first time, I fell completely in love.Mark and Jeremy are roommates. The camera follows not only their lives, through their eyes (as in, the frame holds the hand and the cup of coffee coming towards the ""mouth"" etc.) but also their internal monologues. Hilariously awkward Mark is in love with Sophie, his office chum, and doesn't know when or how to give up his madcap pursuit. Jeremy dreams of being a rock star, but as yet fulfills only the role of lazy messy roommate.From the first episode onward I was laughing out loud, constantly. I want to say it's a new kind of Britcom; but, rather, it's got a charm and comedy uniquely its own. I wouldn't place it in the same category as other popular ""BBC America"" productions...it's certainly much funnier than some of the stuff we have on American networks these days...I've been dying for it to come out on US dvd since last year, and I'm thrilled to be ordering it now.I have heard that Fox picked up ""Peep Show"" and its premise, but I am not sure if this means they are recasting and rewriting, or if they're airing the original Channel 4 episodes from the UK.

How people can compare this with the ultra dire The Office or Extras is beyond me. Compared with the writers and performers in Peep Show Ricky Gervais knows nothing about comedy. I own all four series of Peep Show on DVD and am looking forward to series five! This series makes me proud to be British!",5,British comedy at it's best!,1204934400,"03 8, 2008",2008,445,"['Peep', 'Shop', 'opinion', 'funniest', 'show', 'come', 'Britain', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'easily', 'par', 'Blackadder', 'Father', 'Ted', 'How', 'people', 'can', 'compare', 'ultra', 'dire', 'Office', 'Extras', 'Compared', 'writers', 'performers', 'Peep', 'Show', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'nothing', 'comedy', 'own', 'four', 'series', 'Peep', 'Show', 'DVD', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'series', 'five', 'series', 'proud', 'be', 'British']",Peep Show - Series 1

It has to be one of the best comedy shows ever put on TV. I just do not understand why this show never got more press. I was talking the other day with someone about what shows we would take with us if we could only watch one thing for the rest of our lives. This show wins for giving the most laughs. I have watched every episode of every season countless times and I still crack up laughing out loud. The characters in the show are all awesome - Super Hands, Johnson....but Mark and Jez are just the best. I recommend this to everyone I know. I am just so glad this show exists. It never gets old, it never gets boring. One time a friend came to visit me and instead of leaving my apartment and giving him a tour of Chicago we watched four seasons of Peep Show. We had the best time!",5,Hilarious,1403222400,"06 20, 2014",2014,913,"['Next', 'year', 'will', 'have', 'been', 'decade', 'first', 'watched', 'Peep', 'Show', 'am', 'still', 'watching', 'Peep', 'Show', 'show', 'hilarious', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'comedy', 'ever', 'put', 'TV', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'show', 'never', 'got', 'more', 'press', 'was', 'talking', 'other', 'day', 'someone', 'what', 'would', 'take', 'could', 'only', 'watch', 'one', 'thing', 'rest', 'lives', 'show', 'giving', 'most', 'laughs', 'have', 'watched', 'episode', 'season', 'countless', 'times', 'still', 'crack', 'up', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'characters', 'show', 'are', 'awesome', 'Super', 'Hands', 'Johnson', '.but', 'Mark', 'Jez', 'are', 'just', 'best', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'know', 'am', 'just', 'so', 'glad', 'show', 'never', 'old', 'never', 'boring', 'One', 'time', 'friend', 'came', 'visit', 'instead', 'leaving', 'apartment', 'giving', 'tour', 'Chicago', 'watched', 'four', 'seasons', 'Peep', 'Show', 'had', 'best', 'time']",Peep Show - Series 1
