These characters started off in a cartoon called Sabrina and The Groovie Goolies. This collecton, is part of  the later shows which featured  the Goolies as  the main characters. I hope kids of today can see these and enjoy them. I know I have the recent  BCI release of the entire series from some years back and will still buy this one. I just hope one day they'll release the original Goolies with Sabrina, as the theme music used on that one was slightly different and they even had a live-action cartoon, where the Goolies come out of the cartoon and become real live beings. In the meantime, break out the Alpha Bits, Cap'n Crunch, the Goolies are  back on the air..

So a few days ago, while poking around Amazon, I was delighted to discover that this very inexpensive Groovie Goolies sampler was just released! I received it today, and it's PERFECT. Six episodes chock full of images and sounds I remember from 35 years ago! The color is amazing, and the images look sharp on my set. Several of the episodes, for some reason, have no laugh or applause tracks, but thankfully, two of them do, since that was part of my childhood viewing experience. I will say, those shows without the laugh tracks, allow me to hear for the first time, very clearly, that great, repetitive Groovie Goolies background music! Memorable ""guest bands"" like The Mummies and The Puppies are here, and plenty of those Scooby Doo-style musical interludes. Also fun to see in the closing credits ""Horta-Mahana Sound Effects"" and ""Filmation, A TelePrompTer Company"".
